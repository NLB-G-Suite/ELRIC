<MadSurge> Frendchips_666: anyway, did you read the rules?
<Sir_Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: the only way to get noticed on the jobmarket is to stand on the balls of the guy who's reading the applications
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Have you been to the jobs center at all? Applied to agencies? Used a different CV for each application? Done volunteer work? Considered further education? Considered an apprenticeship?

<AJIsAwesome> Ha, oh Pinkie. :D
<GilDash> Meanwhile: You might want to consider volunteer work regardless. Also, I never found the Job Center any good at all. I got my job through an agency called Ranstad. They not only helped me with my CV, but gave me an interview prep as well. I'd advise you take a look.
<Rainboom> wtf
<MadSurge> Mega_Milk: yep, it's Andrea Libman
<Meanwhile> Her Pinkie sense answered that.

<MadSurge> GilDash: my dad knows two of those agencies, I subscribed to both and went to the job center. Crossing fingers! :)
<Kimori> hi Blueflare
<Mega_Milk> So if he did it with her.....would it be incest....or masturbation......
<Everlasting_Joy> And than what? What is your purpose after that? You're probably walking to your demise!
<DoctoDoctorWho> This fact occured to me after 2 weeks of attempting to design a kickass capital ship for 40k
<Sir_Dark_Horst> did it work?7
<Colt_Brovakiin> good luck MadSurge :3
<Sir_Dark_Horst> nope
<Mega_Milk> cause it's you on you...so...
<Sir_Dark_Horst> i didi it wrong
<MadSurge> Mega_Milk: or simply clone sex
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Mega_Milk: no idea...
<GilDash> Meanwhile: That doesn't help anyone, least of all you. If you're not willing to explore all possibilities then you're going to find the search harder.
<Laurayne> I Have A Question
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Who cares.

<AJIsAwesome> Ah. Thanks, Crimson.
<cachi01> DUNGEOOOOOOOOOOOOON

<Domo> Glad you like! and all right :U~
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: ....
<thelonepony> what? ;3

<cachi01> otakon: http://bwaff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/slenderman-facebook-account.png
<Lunar_Brony> The Hunger Games was a good book. The movie . . . could have been better.
<Ponies47> cachi01: (Rimshot)
<Zombert> I think I broke the chat

<DocSane> Evening, all. Stanidn by on the Boston coast for some wind and fun.
<AJIsAwesome> Brad_: I'm guessing because the pigs anre't capable of living on their own. They aren't really capable of defencding themselves like earth ponies.

<Unnr> thelonepony: Actually a morning star is just a spiked mace
<DaringDerpy> if I had a secret vault, I would secure it with a 20 digit code lock. statues are for posers
<Unnr> a mace like weapon with a chain is called a flail
<cachi01> DONT ARGUE WITH THE VIDEOGAME

<LunasGuard> Sumica: were is that from?
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: Ah. Thank you. :)
<Master_of_War> Assassin's Creed with Guns and fire
<flutter_spin> this just looks epic
<cachi01> Master_of_War: assassins creed has guns and fire...
<Master_of_War> It doesn't have AK-47s
<cachi01> Master_of_War: its kinda stupid if you compare uncharted to AC.
<cachi01> they are completely different
<otakon> yeah
<Master_of_War> He's using parkour to solve puzzles.
<Master_of_War> Assassin's Creed
<cachi01> he is using a un
<flutter_spin> I don't know much more than the first AC, and it was rather boring. I've heard they have greatly improved
<otakon> one is a action game with exploration elements
<cachi01> he is using a gun
<cachi01> cod
<otakon> yh the first AC sucked
<otakon> the second however was GREAT
<flutter_spin> That is what my cousin tells me
<flutter_spin> I have yet to play Brotherhood on my comp
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed cachi01 its like comparing MLP to Indiana Jon- damn it Daring Doo! :D
<Master_of_War> AC1 had an epic storyline but was repetitive as repetative as repetative as crap.
<otakon> yeah the thing with AC is that it was VERY repetitive
<otakon> lol
<otakon> herdmind
<Master_of_War> AC2 took me 35 hours to finish
<cachi01> i've never completed AC1...its the only AC i havent completed in less than 3 days
<Master_of_War> and I'm only part way through Brotherhood
<flutter_spin> I almost.. ALMOST gave up on ... holy crap, this game is intense
<Master_of_War> and haven't done revelations
<cachi01> well nate. u r a lucky son of a bitch
<flutter_spin> O.o
<cachi01> yep
<cachi01> told u lucky
<Master_of_War> THIS IS JUST WORSE!
<flutter_spin> Yeah. AC was an endurance test, I'd say
<Master_of_War> Take a lesson from Indiana jones - just shoot him.
<flutter_spin> Is Uncharted on the PC?
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony whats better ps3 or xbox
<cachi01> flutter_spin: ps3 exclusive
<AJIsAwesome> It's all a matter of preference.
<flutter_spin> figures.
<flutter_spin> All the good games are exclusives
<cachi01> therainbowvortex: imo they are both good =
<Sabershy> therainbowvortex: Gonna open that can of worms,, huh...
<cachi01> console wars is just a stupid thing........ U R GAMERS FOR OD SAKE STFU AND JUST PLAY

<therainbowvortex> Sabershy: yes yes i am i have my opion i wana hear yours
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> does anyone have Uncharted 2? always wanted to have some matches w/ some bronies :)
<cachi01> yeah pc is way better than consoles but they are all good
<Master_of_War> I've taken a lesson from Indiana Jones while assassinating the Bordga captians in Brotherhood - I just shoot them with my arm cannon thing.
<Master_of_War> SO much easier.
<flutter_spin> I have no idea what I was doing before I clicked on the Bronystate bookmark and I don't care anymore.
<cachi01> flutter_spin: watching porn maybe?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<flutter_spin> A little bit of Mechwarrior Online and Professor Layton
<flutter_spin> oh and Hawken
<cachi01> mechwarrior and proffesor layton porn?
<Sabershy> Honestly, I am a gamer that has no preference. I have favorites on all consoles. The only thing is that I have more play time on my XBox360 thanks to halo and CoD. Especially when november comes.
<AJIsAwesome> .......
<twilight_sprinkle> lol cachi01 thats what i was thinking
<SpeccyRush> Nate has better grip than wanderer
<DocSane> God, this game makes me think back tot he first TOmb Raider and how SLOW and easy it seems now.
<Sabershy> Nate has better grip than Spider-man...
<flutter_spin> Its like Dragon's Dogma. Why can't I play it on the PC?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpeccyRush: :O man now i wanna get the Ico/SotC collection :D

<flutter_spin> I guess you just expect something to go wrong every 5 seconds
<DocSane> This is like TOmb Raider crossed with Dragon's Lair.
<Sabershy> Yep, Spider-Man is Nate, not Peter parker.

<thelonepony> Hi AdamTheDuck :3
<HoodyNinja> Does this technically count as a stream right now?
<[SWAG]Haku> HAKU CALLS FOR A TRIXIE EPISODE
<HoodyNinja> AdamTheDuck: Sup sucka?
<[SWAG]Haku> Yes?
<flutterchu> but since the pilot of season 3 will have 2 parts which means ALL TWILIGHT SPARKLE i guess were going to take off the luna episode
<[SWAG]Haku> :(
<AdamTheDuck> Yay, 13 hours till Guns of Icarus \:3/
<Sabershy> Or Cadance.
<SpeccyRush> fuck that shit Luna or nothin'
<[SWAG]Haku> Cadance is part of first 2, is she not?
<HoodyNinja> flutterchu: We could just take out Twilights ep, if she were to have an extra
<AJIsAwesome> Calm down, flutterchu. The show isn't all about Twilight. You do know that the show focuses on the other characters, right?
<HoodyNinja> Wait what?
<SpeccyRush> caution
<HoodyNinja> I need to do this math :P
<Sabershy> I am so sad. I watched that little spoiler on Youtube of Season 3...
<[SWAG]Haku> math: 2+2=fish
<Sabershy> I tried to resist for so long.
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: yes i know.
<SpeccyRush> ok then lets not talk of it then shall we
<HoodyNinja> I have and F in math
<[SWAG]Haku> I try to avoid spoilers for the show
<Sabershy> Please.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<HoodyNinja> And only recently did I find out thats bad
<AJIsAwesome> It's a good thing I didn't see any spoilers about it. :D
<HoodyNinja> I heard the songs...
<HoodyNinja> They suck
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: it's just that she doesnt deserve that much anymore....give the other's more of a chance
<HoodyNinja> Like, really badly
<AJIsAwesome> Not to me.
<Lunar_Brony> *ahem*
<AJIsAwesome> I heard the songs, and they sound fine.
<Sabershy> So, yea. I have now two bottles of Apple Cider and Peach juice, which is really good, surprisingly.
<Lunar_Brony> THESE GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT SEASON 3!!!
<AJIsAwesome> But maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
<HoodyNinja> The twilight's preperation song was OK, but the crystal ponies sucked :I

<geeky> NewSuperBronyU: ok
<Infernap12> not that it sucks any less
<eddmario> Meh, I have an uncle who has 4 kids, all of them pretty young, and he went through a divorce a couple years ago. His kids don't really seem like it affected them at all.
<Infernap12> but it did deep down
<Infernap12> and it will come out later on in life
<Infernap12> i though i was unaffected
<Infernap12> *thought

<Kencolt> Kandarihu: No. I'm 55 in Novenber. I meant 1966.
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, wow. Cool
<Kencolt> WHY is this such a hard idea for everypont to GET?
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, and for some reason (can't remember what) kids can pilot better than adults.
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, something about sync-ratio
<Sumica> 00,10cause old men are not supposed to like ponies I guess
<MadSurge> :D
<Kencolt> AdamTheDuck: Only children born (or concieved- it's nebulous) during Second Impact can pilot.
<MadSurge> THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO

<twilight_sprinkle> coool angel though
<prince-dari> Do they know why the angels want to kill them?
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Because Angels are from science and outer space and hate humens.
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah, geometry is evil
<AdamTheDuck> Science :<
<Sumica> 00,10the why is never covered
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, interpretations >.<
<MadSurge> The idea is "God is pissed"
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Yup
<Sumica> 00,10think of it as a game of capture the flag
<MadSurge> Even though God doesn't look so omnipotent in this anime
<Sumica> 00,10nerv curently has the flag and the angles are trying to get it back
<MadSurge> Powerful, yes, but not omnipotent
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, I see what you did there >.>

<MadSurge> JEALOUS
<Sumica> 00,10the key was not the key in the show
<Sumica> 00,10it was "Adam"
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, not just that, but a metaphor behind it too
<Mutterguy> no Ex Boyfriend I guess
<AdamTheDuck> metaphor, not sure if that's the right word
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: That was one thing that confused the hell out of me in the original. They called the thing Adam, but then when Kaoru went down there, he called it Lillith.
<Polydunami> Who is an idiot here? :|
<Sumica> 00,10adam is the small thing in the case
<AdamTheDuck> Asuka + Shinji moments <3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: japanese and christianity, amirite

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't think so
<AdamTheDuck> Pen pen is best pony!
<prince-dari> Having seen what they call 'angels'
<MadSurge> That guy can breathe in space!
<prince-dari> I don't even wanna think about God.
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, indeed.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He's special
<AdamTheDuck> Angels are messengers of God... So does that mean God's message is death? :/
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Eeyup
<Polydunami> Seems to be, in this show at least.
<BoroBrony> EXTREME DECONTAMINATION :D
<MadSurge> YAAAAY FISHES
<Polydunami> But it's only a bloody movie.

<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: He keeps asking questions. :P
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, angel took control of one of the EVA's
<Polydunami> Ah, it's not a big deal.
<prince-dari> wat
<MadSurge> Sumica: WHAT?! And they didn't realize there was one extra robot?!
<Bronysith> prince-dari: that is the motto of evangelion
<TheOtherOne> Crush Kill Destroy Sawg
<Sumica> 00,10they tryed to make it with angel tech
<MadSurge> GREAT IDEA <_<
<Sumica> 00,10to remove the need for power cords
<alexxm> so did they make a new angel then
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351503654094.jpg hahaha
<Gold_Demona> I wonder why they decided to put Asuka in the suit and not Toji?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bronysith: :D
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, to troll the viewers :$
<Bronysith> Evangelion is definetely one of the best animes out there
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, such a change in heart :3 /)
<MadSurge> God is like "These humans are idiots, I don't even have to do anything after all!"
<Sumica> 00,10Gold_Demona cause toji did't have the ass for a test plugsuit
<alexxm> so are the angels aliens or something
<Bronysith> Sumica: it's all in the pl,ot aint it?
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, nope...
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: LOL Neither does Shinji. :D
<MadSurge> What what human arms what

<AdamTheDuck> <3 this unfitting song
<MadSurge> So they can pilot remote them?! Why don't they do that in the first place?
<Polydunami> I'm not surprised.
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: You'll see.
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit Sumica, no lyrics translations?
<MadSurge> There
<AdamTheDuck> Songs goes like "Lets fly away together" or something like that
<Gold_Demona> I suppose putting Asuka in there makes the emotional struggle a little more dramatic. =/
<Sumica> 00,10oh and shinji cant see any of this, but he can hear and feel it.
<HavokOC> Eyo
<Bronysith> Sumica: oh hey, do you have phantasy star online blue burst? if not, want a link for the download?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello HavokOC
<HavokOC> Hey AdamTheDuck :P
<alexxm> how are things HavokOC

<MadSurge> Wait, I thought Asuka lasted longer than that?
<HavokOC> Yay, a sumistream :D
<prince-dari> Wait why
<CriticKitten> Dari: I don't think they can stop it until it finishes its "mission".
<prince-dari> Why do that?
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351495763403.png
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, it's the dummy system...
<CriticKitten> Alternatively, everyone gripped the stupid ball too hard

<Kandarihu> Bronysith, it's easier to convey feeling when people are shouting than when they are speaking with their indoor voice.
<alexxm> whiny emo
<Bronysith> alexxm: ITS EVANGELION
<CriticKitten> Sorry, I don't find Shinji sympathetic, I find him obnoxiously whiny.

<Bronysith> Sumica: but thats not kaworu
<Gold_Demona> Gendo never gives a fuck unless Rei is involved.
<Kandarihu> In a way, this isn't him growing a spine. It's Shinji going back on a promise. The only time he grew a spine is when he became a consientious objector and resigned. So now that he's going back on his resignation, he's losing any sense of moral integrity.
<Bronysith> shinji=badass
<Bronysith> in a moment
<AdamTheDuck> Badass Shinji is badass.

<Bronysith> https://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1347/58/1347581355598.jpg prince-dari this pretty much sums it all up
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: His sheer emotion allowed the eva to break out of its restrictive armor and become its true self.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, who said that Shinji was being lusty?
<MadSurge> Killer7 made more sense than this
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everyone :)

<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: prepare for assimilation
<Bronysith> ANYONE interested in playing phantasty star online blue burst? i can give you a link
<AdamTheDuck> I'll keep to my first person shooter :3
*Bronysith murders AdamTheDuck
<Mutterguy> you mean in the afternoon Sumica?
<prince-dari> So at the end of that episode
<Serenity> And with that
<Serenity> Time for TF2
<prince-dari> Who is actually dead?
<Cypresswolf> its 43 outside this morning :S
*AdamTheDuck stabs Bronysith with a progressive knife
*Bronysith goes berserk and eats AdamTheDuck
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: Tell me that's farenheight?
<RaveBrony> O_o
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, umm, Asuka isn't dead if that's what you're wondering
*Ponies47 Hates mornings -.-
*Bronysith loves em
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Mutterguy> Serenity regardless, you'd still complain
<prince-dari> How is she not dead?
*RaveBrony is a morning person
*Midnight_Stormwing is sick
<RaveBrony> :3
<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: ha
*Ponies47 Glomps RaveBrony
<Serenity> Mutterguy: I wouldn't. In ye olde Britain, it's almost freezing outside
<RaveBrony> That sucks, Midnight_Stormwing D:
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, the preview showed her with an eyepatch... That's why I screamed out "PIRATE ASUKA!"
<Serenity> My thermometer reads 2
<Cypresswolf> Serenity: Isn't it always :)
*RaveBrony hugs Ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, at the end of the movie, it shows the trailer for the next movie
<Bronysith> prince-dari: misato kisses shinji
<Mutterguy> oh well it's 12 here in Christchurch but it's night time
<Cypresswolf> :'( 38 with the wind....I dont wanna go outside
<Bronysith> and everyone in the world turns to delicious tang
<prince-dari> So really
<prince-dari> At the end of all that.
<Mutterguy> ooohhh 20 degrees tomorrow and it's ognna get hotter
<prince-dari> What has actually happened is nothing.
<prince-dari> Entirely nothing.
<Serenity> I don't get Farenheight, it sounds really exaggerated
<Ponies47> I have no idea how bad it is outside today because I don't give a flying feather :P
<prince-dari> They just want to confuse you, and make you think that something has happened.
<MadSurge> ^^^^^^^
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, no, they survived the onslaghts of the angel's attacks and is "one step closer" to reaching instrumentality
<Mutterguy> which means what?
<prince-dari> They're one step closer to something happening.
<prince-dari> Doesn't mean anything has happened.
<prince-dari> Oh good, something might happen sometime soon, soonish, sooner than it was soon previously.
<AdamTheDuck> Instrumentality is action of destroying all of the past life, destroying the past world and remaking it in the way they want
<AdamTheDuck> Everyone becoming one and remaking the world, essentially becoming God
<MadSurge> They killed another giant monster. And then symbolism. Cue credits. :|
<Midnight_Stormwing> sounds like prince-dari is overthinking evangelion... which is not a good idea cause the show and movies are meant to be convoluting and confusing as f***
<Mutterguy> ZUm in fairness does surviving the battle ofBritian counts as nothing? because that's what's been going on
<Bronysith> comment on youtube "This Anime Is Legendary, EXCEPT THE MOVIE END OF EVANGELION!!!( it didn't suck it was just depressing and yeaaah wtf). The Remakes 1.0 2.0 and the upcoming 3.0﻿ are amazing. Not enough people in America know this anime exist and some consider themselves anime fans!" cancer
<Bronysith> are you fucking kidding me
<prince-dari> Fine something did happen, they killed some big things, which changed absolutely nothing.
<RaveBrony> Hmm?
<Bronysith> everyone and their mother knows what evangelion is
<MadSurge> prince-dari: exactly
<Vivix> action for actions-sense, no plot-dev?
<Vivix> I didn't watch so I don't know
<Serenity> Guys, if you lot are gonna argue and debate, take it to the deathmatch arena
<Midnight_Stormwing> oooh... deathmatch
<Midnight_Stormwing> me gusta
<Bronysith> Vivix: the rebuild movies seemed to focus more on action instead of character development
<prince-dari> Not arguing.
<Vivix> ^^
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, it's not like there's no plot, just most of the anime is watching the characters change and develop, and overcoming their mental issues.
<prince-dari> My brain is trying to work out what just happened.
<MadSurge> Enough robot bullshit, I want ponies now
<Vivix> you guys were showing the movies?
<Serenity> MadSurge: O u
<Bronysith> prince-dari: enjoy trying to sleep tonight
<prince-dari> And the result it's come up with is nothing.
<Vivix> Aah
<Mutterguy> ooh...Celebrity Deathmatch?
<prince-dari> Entirely nothing...
<Midnight_Stormwing> heres how you work out what happened prince-dari, you dont think about it cause its confusing and your just annoy the shit out of yourself
<Bronysith> ^
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, give it time.
<Vivix> Remember though, not everything is for everyone
<Serenity> Bronysith: Still gonna be at least 12 hours before he goes to beddy byes, I presume it'll be out of mind by then
<prince-dari> What's there to be confused about? Nothing has happened.
<RaveBrony> Take heart, prince-dari, they Might explain in in an episode or two, lmao
<RaveBrony> *it in
<Bronysith> Serenity: after i finished the original series, i dreamt i was an EVA pilot
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, the problem is you didn't see the original series, you didn't see the true death of Rei, you didn't see nearly enough of how fucked up Asuka's parents were...
<Midnight_Stormwing> and yet that seems to be bothering you prince-dari even though so much has happened that is different from the show version of evangelion
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, they were explaining the meaning of what happened at the very end.
<RaveBrony> Ah :P
<prince-dari> Midnight_Stormwing: What was bothering me was how well they'd masked the fact that nothing had happened.
<Kandarihu> The only part that by itself doesn't make sense was explained as it was happening.
<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: you sick today, so no class for you...i still have to go
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, the rebuild movies are very different from the original show
<prince-dari> With all sorts of crazy shit to divert your attention.
<prince-dari> From the fact that nothing happened.
<Gold_Demona> Oooook
<Bronysith> i think prince-dari has the crazies now
<Bronysith> i did too
<Midnight_Stormwing> i wish i didnt have to go to school... but im not that sick... not dying yet...
<Serenity> Gold_Demona: Mind your 'ookin' launguage
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<prince-dari> nope, I've cracked it.
<prince-dari> I've got this shit.
<RaveBrony> Do you watch alot of anime, prince-dari? O.o
*Mutterguy hands Gold_Demona a banana
<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: thats the spirit
<prince-dari> RaveBrony: Nope.
<RaveBrony> Ah, i see
<prince-dari> I've seen something like 4 probably.
<Vivix> Huh- me too
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, apparently your mind discarded everything that DID happen as crazy stuff that has no bearing on the plot.
<prince-dari> Well it was
<Midnight_Stormwing> and this is why i dont talking in mane chat anymore... random arguments or 'discussions' about something completely irrelevant... =,=
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Resonantwaves> Hello
<Resonantwaves> :3
*Resonantwaves explodes
<prince-dari> He turned into a God for about 5 seconds before some guy stopped him, resulting in nothing happening overall
<Vivix> This is the reason I don't watch many animes though, a lot of them tend to make no sense to me- and just end up not interesting me
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Resonantwaves :3
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Resonantwaves :P
<prince-dari> None of the characters actually died in the end
<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: they just streamed the movie though?
<Resonantwaves> hiya :D
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, you're dismissing the plot as a distraction. Watch it again some time and actually pay attention this time.
<prince-dari> All that happened was some big things died, which doesn't affect anything.
<Cypresswolf> finally found my heavy jacket - Im good to go...except for the huge mess I made looking for it :S - I just made myself a chore
<AdamTheDuck> prince-dari, Shinji's friend was supposed to pilot the EVA that went out of control and die.
<RaveBrony> You have to watch from the very beggining :D
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: That's future your problem
<Colt_Brovakiin> :D
<Cypresswolf> :D Me in 10 hours - countdown
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Which ones did you try watching? O_o
<Vivix> Well, I liked some of the ones Isaw
<Bronysith> my hair is so fluffy goodness
<Kandarihu> Okay, FINE. Watch the TV series, then if you want the characters to be properly established. Just don't hold your breath for Shinji to become a better person, though.
<Vivix> I watched..Death note..scrapped princess..and some others I can't remember
<Cypresswolf> Bye Everypony :)
<Bronysith> death note is for yaoi fangirls
<Ponies47> Bye Cypresswolf
<Phase4> hmmm, i've got problems with php still
*Vivix likes some yaoi
<Serenity> Cya, Cypresswolf
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Well, no wonder. You watched all the mind-screw animes. :P
<Phase4> why is this software so poorly designed
<AdamTheDuck> Goodbye cyp-gone >.<
<Phase4> no one seems to know
<Vivix> Hehe, well I acutally liked Death Note, because--the hero noone expected to die died
<Vivix> that I liked, but- I dunno, it wasn't the best thing I've seen
<Ponies47> You are so slow AdamTheDuck :3
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: My favorite anime is Lupin the 3rd
<Vivix> Can't remember what happened in Scrapped, but I liked it
<Vivix> Hmm, haven't heard of that one
<Bronysith> i enjoyed inuyasha
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, I wrote Bye Cypress, but #bronystate :Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set)
<Vivix> I just tend to stay away from action animes--or you know "the world is ending" series in general
<Bronysith> Gurren lagann is my fav anime though
<Resonantwaves> ;A;
<Gold_Demona> It's good. It's about a thief and his gang and they're being chased around everywhere by a cop who's obsessed with catching him.
<Vivix> What time period or--world thingy?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Well, that depends on what series/special/movie you're watching
<Vivix> Ooh~~
*Vivix confused already
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Usually it takes place during the time era the piece was made in. :P
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: The original series takes place in the 70s.
<Vivix> Ooh, yeah
<Resonantwaves> whats everyone doinggggg
<Gold_Demona> Lots of jazzy disco music
<Vivix> Funky stuff, aaall over
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: The more recent TV specials takes place in the age of computers and iPhones
<Gold_Demona> But it's all supposed to be just regular earth.
<Vivix> ah cool
<Gold_Demona> They go to various places and steal various trasures and stuff
<Vivix> I kinda like--sticking ot that, but I also like heavy fantasy- without humans and stuff
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: There are some fantasy elements here and there
<Vivix> Lately I'm kind of enamored with feral-furry stories, but there's not many I've found
<Vivix> But yeah, I might check that out- I don't watch a lot of series anymore, but never hurts to try things
<Vivix> like death note, I didn't want to see it at first, but- I did enjoy it
<AdamTheDuck> So anyway... So relaxing music for this slowing down chat. :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THQM52jk0gg
<AdamTheDuck> Some*
<Gold_Demona> The nice part about Lupin is that it's extremely episodic. No continuity whatsoever. So you can literally start watching anywhere
<Gold_Demona> And watch it in no particular order
<Vivix> Aah, that's always a good thing when jumping into long running series
<Gold_Demona> And the feel of the piece is different depending on who's directing it. Sometimes it's heavy on the comedy, sometimes it's sweet and heart-warming, Usually it's kinda raunchy, and sometimes it's angsty.
<Kandarihu> I happen to value continuity in my stories. Episodic series are always stuck in "Status Quo is God" mode.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ikr, continuity is just a bonus
<Bronysith> BYE everypony, off to class
*Bronysith explodes into space
<AdamTheDuck> Goodbye Bronysith
<Kandarihu> Later, Bronysith
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Lupin the 3rd is timeless, bless Monkey Punch
<Gold_Demona> I love continuity also, but it's nice when a series isn't restricted by canon
<Vivix> I like continuity depending on what kind of story
<Gold_Demona> Which Lupin is. At my last count I think there were like 4 different origin stories for Lupin and his gang
<Vivix> Hehe
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, 5 hours \:3/
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Gold_Demona> My two favorites are "First Contact" and the new series "The Woman Named Fujiko Mine"
<Mutterguy> Aww I was gonig to ask bronysith if his planet needs him :(
<Resonantwaves> Night everyoneeeeeeeee
<Mutterguy> byeeee
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Resonantwaves
<Gold_Demona> But that's enough about that. Now I'm babbling. :P
*Vivix wikis both those
<RaveBrony> Cya Resonantwaves!
<Gold_Demona> I warn you though. The Fujiko Mine series is VERY raunchy
<Gold_Demona> I almost couldn't watch through it.
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Gold_Demona> Luckily it's only 13 episodes long
<Mutterguy> When I see First Contact i think of the Carl sagan movie
<Vivix> "Because the show airs at 1:29 am,[2] it technically debuted on April 5, 2012."
<Vivix> That's quite some time to air
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<Vivix> but yeah so Fujiko Mime is like that season or---run?
<Gold_Demona> huh?
<Vivix> Since it's 13 episodes-
<Gold_Demona> It's just a short series
*Vivix not quite used to the anime world
<Vivix> ahh
<Ponies47> I gotta go now school. Laters
<Gold_Demona> There are shorter. FLCL is only 6 episodes long. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<Gold_Demona> That series is a complete mind-screw though.
<Vivix> !
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and yet it makes much more sense than Evangelion
<Gold_Demona> It makes less sense than Eva
<Vivix> Hehehe
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: not possible
<Kandarihu> I have a series on my HD that's 2 episodes. It's even more mindscrewy than FLCL
<Gold_Demona> What series is that?
<Kandarihu> Twilight Q
<Gold_Demona> Never heard of it... Don't think I want to either. O_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: if it's for comedy's sake then mind screw is acceptable :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is true.
<Gold_Demona> And FLCL pulls that off quite well
<Gold_Demona> Bobobo Bobo Bobo is like that too.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: although there are good serious mind screw things
<Gold_Demona> Ohey a stream
<Vivix> What a name
<Kandarihu> FLCL was made as a holiday from Evangelion.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I love Bobobobo Bobobo
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit Phase4
<Mutterguy> Sudden omnious Pinano!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: he's seven times mother.
<AdamTheDuck> Y u scare everyone?
<Mutterguy> Piano
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I like Bobobo because the English voice of Bobobo is the same guy that does my favorite English voice for Jigen. :D
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, :3
<AdamTheDuck> 5 hours \:3/
<AdamTheDuck> Oh wait... It's 6 hours
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like silly things like Bobobo :D
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, are there many people in the lobby right now?
<Vivix> Is that the starfish thing?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, there usually is, but I was about to head off to sleep soon :P
<Kandarihu> Ah, Bobobo. The shonen action series in which mindscrew is weaponized.
<Mutterguy> so do you just keeps saying bobobobobobobobo and hope people willl understand? because that seems hard
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, need my sleep, maths test up tomorrow :3
<Phase4> ah
<AdamTheDuck> Dem logs, indices and functions aren't gonna work themselves out >.>
<Phase4> stupid apache
<Phase4> i don't want you to run index.php
<Phase4> i want you to tell php-fpm to run it
<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: Nah, Bobobo is the guy's name. Bobobo Bobo Bobo.
<MadSurge> Mutterguy: it's a manga/anime series where the protagonist is a muscular man with a giant afro that fights with his nose hair.
<Vivix> Wat
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, from what I've noticed, there were loads of people in the beta throughout the day, around 10 rooms open, most of them full, there was even a full 4v4 match
<Gold_Demona> Pronounced "Bo b'bo Bo BO b'bo"
<Mutterguy> that sentence...
<Phase4> soo much invite
<MadSurge> I am not kidding
<Vivix> Amazing
<Phase4> and then steam broke
<Mutterguy> I realise but... that sentence
<Gold_Demona> He fights with his nosehair and his fro for the right to have hair
<Vivix> Steam is so silly sometimes
<Phase4> "connection attempt failed"
<Gold_Demona> It's not a sentence. It's his name
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, you need to register as well for GoI
<Mutterguy> no what MadSurge said
*Jmo rolls around
<MadSurge> His best pal is the anthropomorpiphication of an explosion that is even sillier, Mutterguy
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, o_O
<Vivix> Hiii Jmo
*AdamTheDuck rolls around with Jmo :$
<Phase4> it won't connect :(
<Gold_Demona> Oh lol XD
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, it'll ask you to create a character name and your email when you connect
<Gold_Demona> I only watched the first couple of episodes of it. Mostly to listen to Bobobo's voice.
<Mutterguy> ...i guess i have to what that then. if the description is making me chuckle ten it has to be good
<Mutterguy> *watch
<Phase4> ah
<MadSurge> Brb putting away pots and boiling some pasta
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, and isn't it hard to read dark red on a black background? :P
<Phase4> it is a bit
<Mutterguy> yeah i better go to be now
<Phase4> but i cbf changing the colours
<Mutterguy> *bed - see all the typos!
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, just use a preset colour scheme, that's what I did :P
<Kandarihu> I do get a vibe from Bobobo in that it was meant to somehow spoof Hokuto no Ken.
*Gold_Demona sets down fly paper for Jmo to roll on
<Jmo> Huzzah :3
<Kandarihu> Oh yeah. Everyone's fighting style has names that start with "Fist of the"
<AdamTheDuck> Dat intro music
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, yeah, guns of icarus is broken for me :(
<Vivix> Covering yourself in tape and slowly pulling it off can be an interesting experience
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, :<
<Jmo> You'd know Vivix.
<Gold_Demona> Fist of the Nose Hari!
<Gold_Demona> hair*
<Mutterguy> Freeee leg waxing!
<Mutterguy> score!!!
<Phase4> i think my isp is having routing issues
<TheMaster> anyone else being hit by a hurricane?
<Vivix> Apparently not-
<AdamTheDuck> Well I need some sleep for tomorrow
<Phase4> TheMaster, thats hitting land?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone :)
<Mutterguy> nope. I'm just being hit by the feeling tiredness and a very mild head ache
*AdamTheDuck stops rolling around with Jmo :<
<TheMaster> its going to be flying over my house in a few hours or so
<Mutterguy> good AdamTheDuck
<TheMaster> or maybe a day, eventually
*AdamTheDuck procededs to hit the hay
<Kandarihu> I'm a long way from the coast. I might get some rain from Sandy, but nothing like what NYC is getting.

<Speedblade> I have a Canadian accent, but im from Estonia.
<XAX> ._. Sibsy was using a rather dark pone picture as a facebook banner over Halloween this year.
*Vivix is older than Dari, feels strange
<Jmo> Haah, you're old.

<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> Rev: I is she. :3
<Vivix> for some reason I always envision 28-32 to be comfortable age-
<Vivix> I'll probably regret that thought when I am that old, but eh-
<XAX> lawljaymo
<Rev> Yay! You don't taste like testosterone then!
<Vivix> or- maybe not
<XAX> iknow
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Going by my own experience, I think 25 is the best age

<Vivix> What headcrabs do when they mount your head-
<Vivix> damn you lamarr
<Vivix> or rather, Dr. Kleiner
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Lamarr is harmless tho. I wouldn't mind having her on my head. XD
<Speedblade> Dr Lamarr
<Rev> I'm not! Although your conditioner tastes delicious, Gold_Demona x3
<Vivix> but Kleiner said it's their way of maating
<Jmo> .-.
<Speedblade> Lamleiner
<Vivix> "Fruitlessly, ofcourse"
<Gold_Demona> Rev: I don't use conditioner. :D
*Vivix plays Wen ad
<Rev> Then it is your shampoo!
<Mutterguy|SLP> Wait... i can't figure out if Jmo is British or Aussie
<Vivix> He's an AC
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Mating? By taking control of a dead body? O_o
<Rev> Necrophilia? Neat.
<Jmo> lolwut?
<Jmo> Wat.
<Vivix> Apparently- he said, eeh, I can't remember the direct quote, "The worst she can do is to attempt to mate with your head. Fruitlessly of course"
<Rev> prince-dari, sounds like Reanimator, doesn't it?
<prince-dari> Oh God
<Vivix> Suddenly stay away from Lamarr
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: LOL That makes Barney's nickname for them even more appropriate. Head humpers. :D

<Rev> Dari has a thing for zombie rape and necrophilia apparently >.>
<prince-dari> Oh, you know me
<DocSane> What the hay am I looking at?
<Vivix> Now imagine all the zombie movies, but isntead of tense music, you get 70s disco music
<Speedblade> Stop talking about necrophilia,pedophilia and other shit
<Vivix> "bow chika chika bow"

<TheMaster> well it looks like the hub is in full spoiler mode
<Infernap12> theMaster: how so?
<TheMaster> this is going to be harder to avoid than harry potter spoilers were
*SpeccyRush|Contestin glances at the topic
<TheMaster> well the hub and several channels just showed the first 8 minutes of the new season
<Infernap12> what the hell!
<TheMaster> its on eqd
<TheMaster> look
*SpeccyRush|Contestin glances at the topic
<Infernap12> i dont think i want to
<NullRadix> EQD has been pretty good about keeping spoilers... marked
<TheMaster> it is marked
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/0MB3r.jpg Jesus Christ How Horrifying
<NullRadix> I think the only "spoiler" I've unwittingly ran into was because they embedded a youtube video that was a playlist, and it went from the original item to a spoiler item
<SpeccyRush|Contestin> MadSurge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq8_tDJpePk

<Dken2021> allo Ankano_BrOnyxia, and geez ,it's in 12 days
<Dken2021> so what won the lottory?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> :D
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ill make a chat room especially for GBC
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> and idk
<Dken2021> gameboy color?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> nah. greek brony community
<MadSurge> :D
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> :P
<Rev> There's already a channel for that
<Rev> #geek
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> not geek lol
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> greek
<Rev> Ohhh
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> xD
<Rev> People in Greece have computers still?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> funny
<Rev> Seriously, isn't Greece fucked over in an economical sense?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> well there are many people acting like fags about it so nvm
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> and no
<Rev> Well, that's just the last thing I heard about Greece. Back in like, May
<TheMaster> Germany is going to bail them out
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> media?
<TheMaster> until spain and italy collapse because of their debt and then game over
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> its not only greece. many other countries have economical problems
<Barb|CardboardBox> hai
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> they dont seem to care now. but when they will it will alrdy be late
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> like us
<TheMaster> the only economical problem is that they can't into competetive economies. Retirement at 50-60 is ridiculous. Nobody in greece produces anything and the people expects handouts.
<Dken2021> allo barb
<TheMaster> expect*
<Brovakiin_Kinect> Hai Barb|CardboardBox
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ill just leave though and go live somewhere else

<Brovakiin_Kinect> Hai Hoody|Skool
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> and hi
<Hoody|Skool> Hai~
<Barb|CardboardBox> Its kind of sad that the only reason I know the Greek economy is bad is thanks to a development company out there. They created Darkfall.
<Hoody|Skool> why is it so much harder to wake up when its cold -_-
<Dken2021> because the bed is so warm and you don't wanna get out :3
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> economy got fucked up coz
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> politicians
<TheMaster> its not your fault if you're in the united states. our media doesn't seem to know that there arn't places other than the u.s. and the middle east
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> r like thieves here
<TheMaster> are places*
<TheMaster> no, not politicians. the people wanted crippling socialism and they got it.
<Hoody|Skool> I
<Hoody|Skool> am

<Prince_Blueblood> some random ugly ass guy comes over and says "hey I've been looking for you!"
<Prince_Blueblood> to the girl I'm out with
<Prince_Blueblood> at this point I'm thinking "what the fuck"
<Prince_Blueblood> and she's like "oh, this is my brother"
<Prince_Blueblood> and he's telling her how he needs a ride to work NOW
<Prince_Blueblood> so she has to drive this clown to work

<Serenity> AJIsAwesome: Well, to put it bluntly and lightly, after my cooking, I want to kill someone brutally
<AJIsAwesome> I'm fine, Colt_Brovakiin. :)
<Laurayne> Hello aji
<Laurayne> AJIsAwesome:

<Serenity> Well, I couldn't find my main tin opener

<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<Serenity> 20 minutes later, I decided to just pull a knife and hammer trick
<Laurayne> Hey AJIsAwesome
<Serenity> Then even more, my toaster launched out a lice of toast onto the floor
<Serenity> So my cat robbed it
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch.

<Serenity> twilight_sprinkle: Wow, you're 'well old
<Serenity> twilight_sprinkle: I'm quite sure that there's no filly foolers here.
<Laurayne> Dont You Know Its Impolite To Call A Lady Old >:(
<Jmo> LOL
<Laurayne> Filly Fooler Is Lesbian Yes?
<Serenity> Judging by the name, I'd presume young
<Serenity> Since filly = horse less than 4 years old
<otakon17> Laurayne: Yh fan term
*Laurayne Is A Filly Fooler
<otakon17> Serenity: Filly can also be a female horse
<Colt_Brovakiin> D:
<otakon17> Cherchez la Mare maybe?
<Serenity> Filly is female horse less than 4 years old :P
<Serenity> And colt is male less than 4
<Cades> dear god theyre playing the ghost busters music at my school
<otakon17> Serenity: Well horse age is a little different than human ages remember?
<Serenity> otakon17: This is in Human years
<MadSurge> "Silly filly" sounds so appropriate :D
<otakon17> Also just beat episode 4 of The Walking Dead
<Serenity> otakon17: Is he dead? Or did you save him?
<otakon17> Serenity: No no I mean in terms of maturity and such
<MadSurge> otakon17: another cliffhanger?
*Laurayne Likes Dem Boobies
<otakon17> Ofc
<Serenity> You murderer
<otakon17> Laurayne: Who doesn't? :P
<otakon17> Serenity: If you mean who fell, no I saved him
<Serenity> Anyway, lets stop talking about our sexual orientation
<Serenity> otakon17: Oh, that's alright then
<Laurayne> Why? Me Wanna Talk ABout Boobie :$
<otakon17> Serenity: Yh but it went the route I fogured it would

<Serenity> I'm sure it's M :P
<OneTrickPony> smelt: yes I do

<OneTrickPony> smelt: lol thnx
<twilight_sprinkle> according to topic its rated P, for peanuts
<Serenity> This chat is rated c :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> does this look evil-ish http://i47.tinypic.com/24y4wms.jpg http://i50.tinypic.com/2mrxu1z.jpg ? or just plain silly ?
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, why did she cover up the torch?
<otakon17> The chat is PG13
<otakon17> So nothing explicit
<twilight_sprinkle> nou oatkun
<Serenity> AJIsAwesome: Because it still provides power
<otakon17> Ask the mods
<Serenity> And looks nicer too
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Bit of both. More the first, but a little of the second.
<twilight_sprinkle> oi oatkun wat movie is dis

<OneTrickPony> I thought it gives you a trial

<Jmo> Dat halloween special
<Jmo> Alot of trash too
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Japanese Comic: Many Many Pony
<ASoftFluffyThing> OH MY GOD.
*Jmo huggles ASoftFluffyThing
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, ASoftFluffyThing? :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> The fuck...?
<Jmo> :<?
<ASoftFluffyThing> All those joins
<Jmo> ima sowwy.
<Barb|CardboardBox> da fuk
<AJIsAwesome> ???
<Barb|CardboardBox> I invited them. They will not be cleaning up afterwards.
<NullRadix> ah, the bliss of the FlashClient
<ASoftFluffyThing> Did anyone else randomly disconnect about 10 minutes ago?
<Barb|CardboardBox> lol
<Barb|CardboardBox> Creeper angry
<AJIsAwesome> Netsplit
<Jmo> You were part of the netsplit
<NullRadix> ASoftFluffyThing: yes, many disconnects
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oooh
<Barb|CardboardBox> Ah. I see not logs for join/leave
<Barb|CardboardBox> no*
<Barb|CardboardBox> yay for flash chat indeed.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm using mIRC
<Barb|CardboardBox> I actually do have mirc on this computer.
<Barb|CardboardBox> I just don't use it
<Barb|CardboardBox> I use it at home though
<OneTrickPony> I just started using mIRC again
<OneTrickPony> it is nice
<shana> do I hear haibane renmei?
<jammerKunk> The music is oddly fitting.
<jammerKunk> Goddammit, splits.
<Kammerjunk> That's better.
<NullRadix> it would not be crazy to suggest "get used to it"
<NullRadix> hurricanes and whatnot
<Kammerjunk> Yes, it is the season for such in America, is it not?
*NullRadix looks outside
<NullRadix> sure looks like it
<Shizuka> 13oh i think i know what the problem is
<Kammerjunk> I don't know about you, but this all looks like fancy magic to me.
<Eli> good evening
<Kammerjunk> Evenin'.
<BladedWings> hi Eli
<NullRadix> evening Eli
<Shizuka> 13or i'm wrong..
<Shizuka> 13odd bug..
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Eli. :)
<Eli> what's up?
<HavokOC> wait
<HavokOC> Something wrong shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13when retracting, my bridge goes two pulses then waits the rest of the cycle
<taoumi> this is nice recovery music Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13once the light cycle finishes then the bridge starts accepting pulses again
<Shizuka> 13the lights are supposed to be on all through the cycle, which works for the extend phase
<Chrysalis> What on earth are you playing?
<Chrysalis> Hmm, minecraft
<NullRadix> Chrysalis: legos extreme
<Chrysalis> not sure what you mean by light pulses
<Chrysalis> i see frames
<Shizuka> 13signal comes in here to a toggle latch from the buttons
<Chrysalis> Right, what are you trying to do?
<Shizuka> 13it's constantly pulsing one of the frame motors, this just switches which one
<Shizuka> 13there's a counter set for 8 pulses to control lights up top
<HavokOC> hmm
<Chrysalis> Why not use a state cell?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just seeing that makes me go dizzy ._. can't even do a proper red stone door
<Kammerjunk> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Looks a lot like witchcraft to me.
<HavokOC> idk myself what's the problem, but i have a friend who's great at these sort of things
<HavokOC> shame he's offline >.>
<Shizuka> 13it doesn't seem to be the problem
<Shizuka> 13the counter itself has no bearing on the bridge
<Kurra> Hory fluff the wind gusts are getting more frequent....
<AJIsAwesome> Sandy?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome! :$
<Jmo> AYEJAY
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge! :$
<AJIsAwesome> JAYMOO :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> which one looks better ? first one or second one http://i48.tinypic.com/2rddr8n.jpg http://i45.tinypic.com/mhdhzq.jpg ?
<Shizuka> 13see there?
<Kammerjunk> I'd say second one.
<Shizuka> 13nothing happens on the return run until the counter turns off the lights
<Shizuka> 13but that's only possible if that line is getting pulses, which go to the motor
<NullRadix> the second strikes me as a better drawing, but I like the perspective on the first more
<OneTrickPony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT second
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not sure. I'd go with first on eyes, but grin on second.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: hope you like Fallout (not Equestria :D ) http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/bfe9a71ee3ae532f2166c6e300a88667.png
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmmm choices choices
<Kammerjunk> Ugh, I want to play Fallout again.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<Kammerjunk> And I blame you, MadSurge.
<Kammerjunk> Not that I mind.
<Shizuka> 13think i need to break for now though, get food
<Shizuka> 13hope ponies enjoyed :)
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: well at least you blame me for a good game.
<HavokOC> :3
<Kammerjunk> I do like food.
<Jmo> Thanks Shizuka~
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I did! It's like grownup Legos :D
<Shizuka> 13if nopony takes up i might come back in later
<Shizuka> 13we're probably extra dead this week because hurricane
<OneTrickPony> THANKS Shizuka
<MadSurge> Shizuka: enjoy your meal!
<Kammerjunk> I wish my desktop was this clean.
<Kammerjunk> But I'm just too lazy to clean up.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Enjoy your food shizu ~ thanks for the stream
<OneTrickPony> brb gonna make top ramen
<Kammerjunk> May your taste buds be blessed with only the most delicious of food, Shizuka.

<Jmo> wtf?
<AJIsAwesome> Link wall -_-
<Jmo> o.O
<Jmo> AJ is stoopid.
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: Might want to derpy.me that in the future.
<AJIsAwesome> ;~;
<AJIsAwesome> I know, use a link shortener. :D
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: GO PINKIE, GET DAT SNIPER
<Kammerjunk> Twiley is best Sniper.
<AJIsAwesome> I just didn't know that it would be that long.
<Jmo> Liar.
<AJIsAwesome> ;~;
<MadSurge> LiarjackisAwesome? :D
<Buytoast> finally, an Illinois ad
<Buytoast> truly, this is the greatest one yet
<Kammerjunk> I just realised I haven't refreshed BronyState in weeks.
<Rainboom> Hi everyone
<Kammerjunk> Of, well. I guess I'll do it when this thing crashes.
<Kammerjunk> Ave, Rainboom.
<NullRadix> afternoon Rainboom
<Kammerjunk> Oh, well*
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rainboom. :)
<Rainboom> sure is pouring outside from where im at 6_9
<Colt_Brovakiin> hai Rainboom
<taoumi> aww that music is over

<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 11 days, 20 hours, 37 minutes, 3 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<Rainboom> woot woot
<Rainboom> my school is closed for today and tomorrow due to the hurricane
<Kawaii_icybeauti> No school again tomorrow..THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED!
<Rainboom> Yay
<Rainboom> we rly need a flutteryay emotion
<Kammerjunk> I'm glad to see some good came out of it. What's the current big whatchamacallit named?
<NullRadix> :[
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That would help. All I did was write "no skool" and put the vid on my FB
<AJIsAwesome> Or we could just link one. :D
<Rainboom> looks like Sandy Cheeks got mad in bikini bottom :/
<Rainboom> no wonder they call it Hurricane Sandy
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I wanted them to name it scrambles.....(In light of the joke) Somepony made fun of texas.
<Kammerjunk> Well, the emotions available in the embedded IRC client aren't really anything the mods can change.
<Kammerjunk> emoticons*
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Rainboom> Im in the mood for some pony thread simulators
<Kammerjunk> Heus, GilDash.
<Colt_Brovakiin> heya GilDash :)
<Kammerjunk> Rainboom: IT BEGINS
<Rainboom> Haii GilDash! :$
<Vivix> the emoticons in the embedded irc is something you add on your own
<BladedWings> aaaaand flash crash :P
<Vivix> well, your own = the mods
<GilDash> Pony Thread Simulators? Eh, what the heck. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, GilDash. :)
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: And not anything anyone using another client can see.
<Vivix> no only the webclient
<Jmo> Pondooo
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash! :$
<Rainboom> I demand more Vinyl Scratch and/or Derpy in the new episodes
<BladedWings> ^
*Vivix demands nothing
<Kammerjunk> I don't really want them to cater to the fans.
<Kammerjunk> That'd be terrible.
<Vivix> same
<Vivix> I want them to keep doing what they're doing, and kinda ignore us
*Jmo slaps Vivix
<BladedWings> Rainboom: if that wouldnt mind that is
<Buytoast> of course it would be horrible
<Jmo> OI
<Vivix> ITS TRUE JMO
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Yeah, same here.
<Jmo> WHY DON'T YOU RESPOND TO ME
<Vivix> WHAT!?
<Rainboom> I would still like vinyl to make more appearence not like change everything THEN it would be screwed
<Jmo> STEAM
<Jmo> I WILL PUNCTURE YOUR LUNGS.
<Rainboom> Like if they added humans in the show o_o
<Vivix> it didn't blink man!
<Kammerjunk> Oh, absolutely. It's great that they acknowledge us.
<AJIsAwesome> Only a little nod to the fans, but VERY rarely.
<Jmo> THIS WHOLE TIME ;__;
<Kammerjunk> Rainboom: Oh Gods above.
<Rainboom> Kammerjunk: The horror the horror
<Vivix> I wouldnt mind more vinyl cameos
<Vivix> but yeah, keep us fans away from the writers
<MadSurge> Rainboom: only for a split second in the background. And noone will ever address it in the show. :D
<Vivix> ^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Did you guys see the spoiler?
<Vivix> nooooo
<Jmo> Oi
<GilDash> Nope.
<Rainboom> Meh
<Vivix> discussing it = ban
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: noooo
<Kammerjunk> I did not and will not see any spoiler for S3.
<Rainboom> yup
<GilDash> Don't want to either.
<AJIsAwesome> It's fantastic of them to acknowledge us, but they should only give nods VERY rarely.
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: No spoilers please
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: indeed
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: I concur.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: Couldn't help it...November 10th is too far.
<GilDash> It's like the moment a spoiler is mentioned I approach the edge of the ship, ready to jump at a moment's notice. XD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And no, I mean that 8 min spoiler on the EQD
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, true- I mean the derpy thing was fun. But you know, keep it at a minimum
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't even see the HUB promo for it. :D
<Rainboom> I usually only watch 1 spoiler to know like what the plot is and all exactly
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Agreed.
<Kammerjunk> I haven't been on EQD for months because they're not very good at hiding spoilers.
<Vivix> I don't want to see promos or anything- I want to be bedazzled and awestruck by all the things
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: I know events until the third episode. After that, it's no spoilers for me!
<Vivix> I didn't even want to know the name of the episode- but I lost that battle pretty fast
<GilDash> I haven't been on EQD in absolutely ages. :S
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: Is that why you guys get angry when the commercial break shows what happens next week?
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Because of S3?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm only on there for stuff not involving S3. :D
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: I no get angry O_o
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: I just don't think they're particularly good at hiding spoilers.
<Rainboom> In my opinion, in the new LPS its like they took half of mlp and put it in there, even if the animators also work for lps and mlp as well.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But soem people go "NUUUU SPOILER!!" during the breaks.
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Nah, I stopped in about May... curiously enough the same time I started spending time on this place...
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Yeah, I have to agree. :D
<Vivix> I still go to EQD, but I scroll as fast as I can to avoid anything about the show
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I found this place after the derpy thing, then came.
<Vivix> I dunno, I just really want to know absolutely nothing
<GilDash> I don't even like knowing what the episode titles are. :S
<Vivix> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: same :D
<Rainboom> GilDash: yea i agree its to like keep the surprises in when the episodes actually air instead of waiting for it
<AJIsAwesome> I seriously don't like knowing what the episode titles are. Even rumor titles.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I offically joined this place when I saw the movie night poster on EQD and District 9 was the A movie.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> GilDash: ....wat?
<AJIsAwesome> It just kills it for me.
<MadSurge> That Derpy reaction video did a lot of good for Bronystate!
<ASoftFluffyThing> So I was like "District 9 is showing, cool!"
<Jmo> AYEJAY IS STOOPI
<Jmo> D
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl jaymoo u fail
<GilDash> Kawaii_icybeauti: What do you mean, 'What?' :S
<OneTrickPony> I have returned with the food of thy gods
<Kammerjunk> You know, I still secretly wish for something to happen that the fans will absolutely love. Because BronyState is funny when that kind of thing happens.
<Rainboom> I go back to school on Halloween so that might be nice
<Jmo> Better be muffins.
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, it's same here, the only preview I saw was the Daring Doo episode, because it looked so fun
<Jmo> Or it ain't food of thy gods.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> GilDash: At least you should know the title. It's one thing to see previews but to not know the title....
<Kammerjunk> Cupcakes > Muffins
<Kawaii_icybeauti> not see*
<GilDash> Kawaii_icybeauti: Yet the titles give things away... I only know the first one and that's one too many. :S
<Vivix> I don't want to know the title, I don't see why I "must"
<twilight_sprinkle> i like muffins more, the bread is tastier
<Kammerjunk> As far as I'm concerned, the title is "Blah Blah Blah, Mister Freeman".
<Vivix> I was like D=! when the !cd revealed the name to me
<ASoftFluffyThing> My gosh, all this clay
<Rainboom> RANDOM QUESTION (hard): If you could only hug ONE PONY which one would it be?
<Kammerjunk> Rainboom: Twiley.
<twilight_sprinkle> pingas
<Vivix> Cloudchaserrr..
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I would glomp....ummmm.....Derpy!
<Vivix> I guess
<Kammerjunk> No doubt. Because she's just that adorkable.
<Rainboom> Kammerjunk: Agreed because Twily is best pony
<OneTrickPony> dashie
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Even thoguh rarity is my fave, she doesn't seem like much of a huger.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hugger*
<AJIsAwesome> I found out about this place through Ballad of The Brony. I stayed here for a while and left, but it was Zombieland on BMN that got me hooked on Bronystate. :D
<Kammerjunk> Also because I'm scared of hugging Pinkie Pie. She'd probably strangle me.
<Turgle> hai everyone!
<GilDash> Hmm... I'd probably have to go with Rainbow Dash, even though she wouldn't like it. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Turgle. :)
<Rainboom> My list if I could hug them: 1: Twilight 2: Pinkie 3: Dashie 4: Fluttershy 5: AJ 6: Rarity
<Kammerjunk> Ave, Turgle.
<BladedWings> hi Turgle
<Jmo> AYEJAY
<Rainboom> Hay Turgle
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I can stay up and watch ink masters tonight...can't wait!
<AJIsAwesome> Ink Masters?
<Jmo> Talking to a wall.
<Jmo> Gfdi
<twilight_sprinkle> octopuses?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: Powerhugs are best hugs!
<Rainboom> I wasbored and watched Bob's Burgers today it was funny I guess
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome
<Kawaii_icybeauti> :O It's a tattoo competition hosted by the guitarist of jane's addiction.
<Kammerjunk> The only Inks I know of are the Ink Spots.
<AJIsAwesome> ouch!
<Jmo> Y U NO RESPOND
<GilDash> Though I wouldn't mind hugging Spitfire either... just because.
<AJIsAwesome> that hurt, Jmo. ;~;
<Jmo> Good.
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Admit it, it's because of the bedroom eyes.
<Vivix> Spitfire would be a good hugger
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Has there really not been a stream since I left here.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> *?
*Rainboom gives AJIsAwesome a fake tatoo with Dashie on it
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Actually it's because of those REA posters, but we'll go with that too.
<AJIsAwesome> What do you want, Jmo? :D
<Jmo> Nevermind.
<Kammerjunk> Kawaii_icybeauti: Depends on when you left.
<Jmo> Steam newb >_>
<AJIsAwesome> Cmon, tell me! :p
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kammerjunk: I left at like 11am
<Jmo> Dat profile
<Vivix> 11AM where?
<Jmo> jesus
<AJIsAwesome> Profile?
<Kammerjunk> I don't know your crazy Moon timezone.
<Jmo> Shhhhh Ayejay
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: you got steam now?
<AJIsAwesome> I don't get it, Jaymoo. :S
<Jmo> You never will.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I have Steam, but not any games.
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Why not? :<
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, MahB- oh
<Rainboom> Just watching the white-dotted circle spinning around and around makes me bored
<Jmo> Ayejay, don't worry.
<AJIsAwesome> But the Buffer Show is AMAZING.
<GilDash> Rainboom: But it's the best show ever!
<Vivix> Come for the buffer, stay for the ponies
<Rainboom> GilDash: My favorite show is Paid Programming
<OneTrickPony> hiya Mah-
<Kammerjunk> My favourite TV show is the TV Test Screen.
<OneTrickPony> why must you taunt me?
<Kammerjunk> I remember we watched it on BronyState once.
<AJIsAwesome> This is the episode where we figure out that Lag's secretly cheating on Buffer, and we figure out about Buffer's long lost cousin!
<Kammerjunk> It was quite interesting.
<Rainboom> I like the white noise channel too :D
<Vivix> My favourite TV show is MLP, becaaause I stopped watching anything else
<GilDash> Rainboom: I've genuinely no idea what that is.
<Kammerjunk> You know what? mips needs the Snake game that YouTube has.
<Vivix> I once hooked up a bass to the TV, that was a fun tv show
<AJIsAwesome> It does, Kammerjunk?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I like the one with the black and white grain and it makes a weird noise.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh wait, It NEEDS it. :D
<Rainboom> Metal Gear Twilight or Metal Gear Dash?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: there is a snake, see it goes in circles trying to eat itself
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: o u
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: How about both?
<Randomnerd> Whooooo
<Vivix> Alles Gut?
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: I never said we cant have both so why not x3
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Rainboom> It would be awesome if there was an episode where the mane6's bodies get switched with eachother
<GilDash> Nah, that'd be too predictable.
<Kammerjunk> Wekk, I'm ging ti olay Falliut niw.
<Rainboom> maybe :P
<Kammerjunk> Okay, I'm going to try that sentence again.
<Rainboom> lawl
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm going to play Fallout now.*
*Vivix applauds effort
<Kammerjunk> This is what happens when I don't place my hand right and don't pay attention.
<Vivix> Misplaced hand syndrome
<Rainboom> Dashie Pinkie Twiliy and Flutters are cutest ponies and I want to hug them all (also Pipsqueak Applebloom Sweetie Belle and Twist :O)
<OneTrickPony> my tastebuds have been satisfied by the food of thy gods
<GilDash> Ambrosia?
<Rainboom> CHOCOLATE MILK >_>
<OneTrickPony> no, top ramen
<Vivix> not a big pipsqueak fan
<Vivix> but I adoore the CMC
<Vivix> and strangely enough, silverspoon and Diamod Tiara
<MadSurge> Vivix: he's cute sounding in Italian :D
<OneTrickPony> applebloom is best cmc
<Rainboom> Trixie Discord and Queen Chrysalisare meh favorite villians in the show because the chaos has been tripled
<Vivix> I prefer Sweetie Bell-
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/1l4Oi.jpg what a tragic loss of nutella
<Vivix> I don't think Trixie is a villain, but I adore her aswell
<Rainboom> Sweetie Belle is best CMC
<Vivix> not so much Discord though-
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Rainboom: /)
<Bronysith> Shizuka: that sucks
<AJIsAwesome> Aw man, that sucks Shizuka.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: NOOOOO WASTED FOOD :(
<OneTrickPony> Shizuka D:
<Rainboom> (/ upside down because im flying with Fluttershy
<Bronysith> Vivix: she isnt a villain, she is an antagonist
<Vivix> I'm not suuuree she's a full on antagonist, but yes, something like that
<alexxm> is the stream still on
<Rainboom> Vivix: I personally feel kind of bad for Trixie, I mean like she was just trying to enjoy herself by "impressing" the ponies with her "magic" and yet they hate on her.
<Vivix> It's an episode riddled up a bit by their hurried change -
<Vivix> but yeah, I feel bad for her
<Vivix> She's a bitch, no away around it, but what she was doing wasn't--you know, bad
<Rainboom> I wanna hug Trixie and tell her shes awesome at magic x3
<ACS13123> O hai
<Rainboom> even if she can barely do it lol
<Vivix> She might be pretty talented compared to normal unicorns, but not compared to Twilight- going by her cutiemark atleast
<Rainboom> hai ACS13123
<ACS13123> I havent been here for ages now ._.
<OneTrickPony> that feel
<ACS13123> I swear... its been a loooong tiem
<GilDash> You shouldn't really insult the audience in showbusiness, but that said, she only started picking on ponies after the Mane 6 began berating her.
<ACS13123> But not long enough for my pass to reset
<ACS13123> So dats gud
<Rainboom> Vivix: It might be more fitting if she was an earth pony claiming that shes a unicorn but you know a unicorn's a unicorn even if they suck at magic xD
<OneTrickPony> ACS13123 when was the last time you were on?
<Vivix> Hmm?
<ACS13123> OneTrickPony: About 2 months ago, maybe 2 and a half, not a looong time but its been a while
<GilDash> I rather see it as Twilight is absurdly talented compared to everypony else. :S
<Vivix> Well, I won't go into the fanon on magic- because we see so little about it in the eshow
<OneTrickPony> oh
<Vivix> but I don't think Trixie is bad at magic-
<Vivix> the crowd seemed to enjoy it until she was heckled
<Dken2021> ah, a pony discussion?
<Rainboom> My friend Kyle joined the herd last week so he might be on here sometime when season 3 rolls by
<MadSurge> ACS13123: Welcome back! Why were you away for so long?
<Vivix> Kinda, we were talking abouuut.. something
<Dken2021> welcome ACS13123!!
<Vivix> then trixie happened
<Kammerjunk|FO> I have my own headcanon on magic. It's hard for me to remember it all some times, so I've written most of it down.
<Vivix> Ah, I haven't written any down, but I've had some great discussions here about it
<Rainboom> I wish I can say that Trixie is best unicorn but Twilight is by far my favorite unicorn and character in the show
<ACS13123> MadSurge: Stuff happened, and I just couldnt be asked to come on here (stuff that happened = TF2 stuff :P)
<Vivix> We don't know much about it in the show- like, babies have uncontrolled magic, kids have to learn magic, Twilight is exceptional at magic
<Vivix> that's about all we really know-
<Bronysith> twilight is best unicorn
<OneTrickPony> ^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> No love for Rarity?
<MadSurge> ^
<ACS13123> Ahh, empty streams
<Dken2021> :<
<Kammerjunk|FO> Twiley is just best pony, though.
*Vivix big Rarity fan
<ACS13123> How I missed you
<Bronysith> rarity is just sexy
<Bronysith> thast it
<Kammerjunk|FO> Ahh, Empty Spaces.
<Vivix> She's talented and wonderful too
<Vivix> Looks and smarts, aw yeah
<OneTrickPony> Rainbow Dash is best unicorn!
<Rainboom> I used to love Rarity she automaticlly made a bigger role in Season 2 and making me laugh at times although she was still funny in S1
<Kammerjunk|FO> Steven Magnet is best pegasus!
<OneTrickPony> ^
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^^
<ACS13123> Also, coming back for season 3... cant miss that.
<alexxm> steven magnet for season 3
<Kawaii_icybeauti> You should have seen snips in Cherrilee's garden. He seemed so sick in it.
<Vivix> Never read that-
<Kammerjunk|FO> Steven Magnet for main villain in S4.
<Dken2021> ehehe
<Rainboom> Snails is best alicorn
<Dken2021> so, anyome know what won from the lottery last week?
<Vivix> That reminds me, Cheerilee is one of my favourite tertiary ponies
<Bronysith> luna and celestia are only alicorns
<Kammerjunk|FO> ...Cadence.
<Vivix> Actually agree Bronysith
<Vivix> I think of Cadence has a watered down alicorn- without the immmortality or full bloodline
<OneTrickPony> Celestia is best earth pony!
<Dken2021> b-b-but Cadance is Cute......
<Kammerjunk|FO> Unless the true Cadence was still a Changeling!
<Vivix> I love Cadence, but she's not immortal
<Bronysith> that doesnt make up for character development Dken2021
<Rainboom> Luna is best earth pon- oh screw it she is best princess
<Kammerjunk|FO> ^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I loved Cadance honestly. Her design is one of my personal favories.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> favorites*
<Vivix> well, if we consider Twilights flashbacks as canon, she is not immortal
<Bronysith> celestia and luna are only alicorns i recognize
<Kammerjunk|FO> Chrysalis has my absolute favourite design.
<Bronysith> also cadances wings look fucking retarded
<Vivix> I liked Cadence a lot, actually
<Kammerjunk|FO> Bronysith: Yeah, well, Celestia is the only alicorn the toyline recognises.
<Vivix> but I don't consider her a full alicorn, don't mind reading fanfics where hse is though
<Bronysith> no time for character development
<Dken2021> Cadance didn't phase me at first, but she's my fav for design mostly
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> I think Cadence could be a pretty good character if they would develop her.
<Bronysith> no
<Rainboom> When I first saw a Canterlot Wedding I automatically LOVED evil cadence/queen chrysalis
<Vivix> She didn't have much of a role
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, that's true Vivix.
<taoumi> hello Bronysith
<Vivix> I still liked her way more than I thought I would
<Kammerjunk|FO> I can tell Bronysith is here. There are no subjective opinions.
<Rainboom> Vivix: Yeah all she was was the bride
<Bronysith> cause then in season 3 they will be worried more about giving cadance more episodes THAN GIVING APPLEJACK HER EPISODES AND SONG SHE SO DESPERATELY NEEDS
<Bronysith> hey taoumi
<Vivix> Kammerjunk|FO, highfive
<AJIsAwesome> WE GET IT SITH.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Rainboom> Calm down Sith 6_9
<Bronysith> seriously, if they give cadance another episode before applejack
<Vivix> I think she's not an alicorn though- but she's something special
<Kammerjunk|FO> Vivix: GIMME DAT MEAT
<Kammerjunk|FO> Bronysith: I will laugh.
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack needs more love. We can ALL agree. :D
<Kammerjunk|FO> At you.
<Vivix> MEAT!?
<Rainboom> APPLEJACK AND/OR DASHIE NEED THEIR OWN SONGSSS
<Vivix> AJ needs more love, but I don't think there's a quota
<Bronysith> Rainboom: dashie already does
<Kammerjunk|FO> Vivix: Hey, I don't know about you, but hands are all the rage right now.
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Same.
<Rainboom> Bronysith: w8 rly? i forgot what it was called
<GilDash> AJ doesn't get episodes, just guest appearances. XD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Bronysith: In the spoilers, and sorry for saying them, there were 2 episodes hinting to apple family episodes.
<Bronysith> Rainboom: may the best pet win is rainbow dash/fluttershy song
<Vivix> Duet though
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: :D
<Bronysith> Rainboom: that is THEIR song
<Rainboom> Bronysith: I mean like a solo song
<Bronysith> Rainboom: well applejack needes a song first
<ACS13123> Bronysith: BOO!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Applejack is best backround pony.
<Rainboom> Bronysith: ye
<Rainboom> yea*
<Bronysith> she had like what? 15 seconds of singing time overall?
<Vivix> Kawaii_icybeauti, I didn't read your message, but saying anything is about s3 is ban
<Rainboom> AJ needs more love
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Uggghhhh....
<Vivix> She does
<AJIsAwesome> As long as AJ gets more love, I don't mind other characters getting more development before her.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> She could use it. I mean, she is one of the mane 6.
<Vivix> True, I wouldn't mind knowing more about Cadence
<Rainboom> I personally think they need more AJ or Rarity episodes
<Kammerjunk|FO> What episodes has Applejack had, by the way? I mean, she had Applebuck Season and the Appleoosa one in S1, but she didn't have any episodes in S2, did she?
<Vivix> I really want to know more about everypony and eveyrthing really, so whatever they throw I'll eat
<Dken2021> as mush as rarity's my fav, she's had enough
*BladedWings BladedWings|AFK
<Kammerjunk|FO> Vivix: This.
<Jmo> You eat ponies?
<Jmo> You evil thing.
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk|FO: Last Roundup, I recall.
<Vivix> in S2 she kiinda had over the barrel, but not really-
<Dken2021> imo that is
<BladedWings> fail!
<Rainboom> Kammerjunk|FO: She had The Last Roundup
<alexxm> Kammerjunk|FO does the last roundup and cider count
<Rainboom> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk|FO: Also the slumber party episode.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kammerjunk|FO: Wouldn't the last roundup and cider 6000 count?
<Kammerjunk|FO> AJIsAwesome, Rainboom, alexxm, Kawaii_icybeauti: No, Last Roundup was clearly a Derpy episode.
<Kammerjunk|FO> But yeah, she had the cider one.
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Rainboom> lawl
<Vivix> Yeah last roundup, that was the one I was thinking about
<taoumi> i wasn't aware that apple jack sang in the cider squeezie 6000
<Vivix> AJ wasn't reaaally that much IN it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kammerjunk|FO: Yeah, It was going to be an applejack epsidoe until derpy appeared :D
<AJIsAwesome> Unfortunately, Derpy stole the spotlight. :D
<Rainboom> D;
<Stormy`> Hi Blako
<Blako> hi Stormy
<BladedWings|AFK> taoumi: she didnt but it was still kinda her episode
<Vivix> It kinda was yeah
<Kawaii_icybeauti> taoumi: We're not talking about siging, it's if she had an epsidoe revolved around her...or at leats was suppsoe to be for her.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rise of the Clockwork Stallions Demo Trailer
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I actually have to agree, even though the episode was mainly about AJ, it gave the other characters much more screen time than her. :D
<Vivix> it was like a mix of AJ FS and RD episode
<Vivix> Yeah, great episode, but more of a m6 episode I guess
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait, what bout fall weather friends?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Agreed.
<Kurra> Dat sustained tropical sotrm force wind
<Vivix> wasn't that S1?
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: OH YEAH, that too.
<ACS13123> You know, I kinda miss being here...
<Rainboom> The Last Roundup, Ponyville Confedential, and Putting Your Hoof Down were probably the most dramatic episodes of Season 2 (well you know, besides A Canterlot Wedding)
<ACS13123> I dunno...
<ACS13123> Huh
<Kurra> Ooh, Earthbound?!
<Vivix> Putting your hoof down was gooood~~
<AJIsAwesome> Rainboom: What about S2 premiere?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Putting your hoof down was bucking awesome.
<Kurra> Spiteful Crow, haha :)
<Rainboom> AJIsAwesome: yeah
<Dken2021> earthbound you say?
<MadSurge> In s3 Applejack will in turn steal everyone else's spotlight :D
<Vivix> oh yeah the premiere was great too
<Kammerjunk|FO> If somepony tries to block, show them your c- no
<Vivix> o u
<Rainboom> Kammerjunk|FO: co- nope
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk|FO: Yeah, no. :D
<Kurra> that you ROCK, Kammerjunk|FO ;)
<Vivix> Why would I show them my chicken?
<Kammerjunk|FO> I'm sure it'd be effective, though.
<Rainboom> nope.avi
<Dken2021> what? he was gonna say cockatrice
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Vivix: *scootaloo
<Vivix> ^^
<Kammerjunk|FO> Vivix: Because chickens are terrifying.
<Vivix> True
<Kammerjunk|FO> Except Scoots.
<Kurra> chickens are zen.
<Vivix> Especially chickens in your eyes
<MadSurge> Dken2021: but that doesn't rhyme!
<Rainboom> Chickens are best pony
<Kurra> I was at this lil' farm thing, and they had poultry that sounded like rusty hinges.
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> Chickens smell weird and are loud
<Kurra> I forget the name of them, but honestly, they sound exactly like they need WD-40
<Rainboom> ScootaLittle Chicken
<MadSurge> Vivix: most birds are like that
<Jmo> Oi leave chickens alone.
<Vivix> yeah-
<Jmo> Use to have one for years.
<Chrysalis_> Woo
<Rainboom> I like doorknobs :D
<Vivix> ever been to a eh chickenfarm for meat production? Horrrribbbleee
<Chrysalis_> think i got 10 mann vs machine running
<Kammerjunk|FO> Kurra: When you said WD-40, I automatically thought of an astromech droid from Star Wars.
<Kurra> Chickens are lovey
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis_: Nice! :D
<Kurra> Hah :)XD
<Rainboom> Chickens are chickeny
<Chrysalis> and i have no idea how to test it lol
<Kammerjunk|FO> Chickens do resemble chickens, yes.
<Kurra> UM.
<Vivix> I can't eat scootaloo, too much water taste
<GilDash> Chickens are lovely. Tikka masala, wonderful dish. XD
<Kammerjunk|FO> I'm sure they taste the part, too.
<Rainboom> BAWK BAWWWKKKK
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Im' having scootaloo for dinner today.
<Vivix> I love Tikka Masala, but I pick out the chicken <,<
<Kurra> One time I went Hwoogaobblegobble at like eight turkeys, and they all responded :D
<GilDash> Vivix: ... Wat.
<VenHur|Laptop> Hey you guys!
<Kurra> I was like 'I FOUND MY PEOPLE'
*Vivix sucks with meat
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur|Laptop! :)

<Jmo> YUSH.

<Jmo> ACCEPT ALL REQUESTS.
<Chrysalis> anyone with tf2 mind trying to connect to my sever just to see if it actually accepts remote connections?
<Kurra> and then I petted a very pregnant goat :'3 <3 and indeed Vivix XD
<Vivix> AWw goats are adorable
<Rainboom> I LOVE GOATS
<Vivix> Not a word Jmo!
<Dken2021> goats are cool
<Rainboom> Vivix: What are you a dictionary?
<VenHur|Laptop> So no stream at the moment?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> goats are adorable, especialy to 2 babies that were at the zoo...so soft..
<Jmo> Screw you, I'll sacrifice all the goats I want.
<Jmo> Ugly things.
<Vivix> ;__; they're prettyy
<AJIsAwesome> For some reason, I can't STAND the eyes of goats and sheep. They just.........creep me out. :S
<Kammerjunk|FO> ^
<Vivix> Yeah the kids are cute
<Kammerjunk|FO> They are very creepy.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: They look like reverse cat eyes.
<Vivix> the eyes take some getting used to, but now I think they're cute too
<Rainboom> one time me and a llama at a part had a staring contedt
<Rainboom> contest*
<Vivix> but AJIsAwesome consider this: Horses have the same eyes as goats
<Vivix> Imagine AJ with goat eeeyees
<Rainboom> oh god

<Pink3> Can somepony give my mom an example of why an 11 year old should be able to play red ead redemption
<Everlasting_Joy> http://youtu.be/gsS-6-gxb30
<Cynder7> 6Well,so far I've made a character (I think she'll be the main one) and have the idea to have her not know anything about her past and stuff..My problem is that I can't really think of a plot thingie..like where it would take place,powers,whether there would be some supernatural stuff..Idk..My head is just stuck on Bleach and Naruto and I can't really come up
<Cynder7> 6with anything different..
<Panda-> DAMN CHAT DERPS!
<Invi> :<
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/46b4e3c9cc1e42f0002f9fd617d3cfce.png Pinkie has a gift for you <3
<Invi> aaw
<Pink3> Can somepony give my mom an example of why an 11 year old should be able to play red ead redemption
<ASoftFluffyThing> d'aww
<Panda|Drawing> MadSurge ok... that is cute.
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: Thank you for that heart attack.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pink3, why would an 11 year old be playing an M-rated game in the first place?
<Invi> Pink3, what is red ead redemption?
<Panda|Drawing> Pink3 well would you like a psychologists aproach to it? ^^
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, it's so ad'aww-able
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: *hides heart attack cannon* what? >_>
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Pink3> I just want you to sugar coat it so i at least have a chance with an EXTREMELY over protective.
<VenHur> Hoofs up if you play both the normal and pony dub of Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites at the same time.
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: I also still love giant lollipops, too bad you don't see them around that often
<RainbowAsh> Panda|Drawing, I'd like to hear a psychologist's approach.
<Pink3> :|
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, you can find giant lollipops. You probably have to go to a fair/carnval or an old-timey general store.
<Serenity> ASoftFluffyThing: You can find them in Ye olde sweet shops
<ASoftFluffyThing> Serenity, I don't think we have one of those over here.
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: yeah, but I mean general stores. At least Chupa Chups are still big :3
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/4CUq0ViezBI
<Serenity> ASoftFluffyThing: "Ye olde sweet shops" are all over Britain, mate
<Panda|Drawing> Pink3 well an 11 years olds mind is still developing. You wouldnt want that child to be influenced by such a game. Not saying that he/she will shoot people actually. The violent nature of the game is the reason that its rated M and thats for a good reason. Though the APA has inconclusive proof that video games has an influecne. Let me grab a quote real quick.
<Panda|Drawing> Shit, sorry chat wall.
<Invi> :D
<Chrysalis> Shizuka oh i hanvt played like that in a long time
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Serenity, I'm in the US. >>
<Cades> ill see if i can think of something
<Serenity> ASoftFluffyThing: I think MadSurge is British :P
<MadSurge> So there's no other side to the Minecraft Wor'd?
<MadSurge> *world
<Dken2021> nope
<Dken2021> just void
<Serenity> ASoftFluffyThing: Besides, you can get sweet shops in America anyway
<Serenity> If we do, you MUST
<Pink3> Panda|Drawing: My mom isnt worried about the violence on the back of the case it says Strong Sexual Content & Nudity. I went onyahoo answers and there is only one sex scene and can be skipped.
<MadSurge> Serenity: I am italiano, grazie tante :D
<Cynder7> 6I'll try and show you the character too :3
<Pink3> not necicarlly on te violence :P
<Serenity> MadSurge: Could buy a pizza and lodge it on a lolly stick? D:
<DashWithRainbows> Dat spelling
<Panda|Drawing> Pink3 ^^ as I said its rated M for a good reason.
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<Serenity> Panda|Drawing: A*
<Zombert> AND I"M ALIVE
<MadSurge> Serenity: could, but tomato sauce and sugar don't go well together :D
<Invi> Zombert, you are?
<Zombert> Damn that eas a rush
<Panda|Drawing> Serenity A what?
<Pink3> Panda|Drawing: But it can be skipped the only other sexual content in the game is a woman being "harassed" it oesnt say how :|
<artist> Everlasting_Joy: the cash4gold one killed me
<Zombert> Was*
<Serenity> Panda|Drawing: Thought graphic Nudity was A?
<Zombert> So what did I miss
<Everlasting_Joy> artist: Did you see the "Impact Gel" or "Neverscrubber"?
<RainbowAsh> Zombert, not much. How did it go?
<artist> i saw impact gel, not neverscrubber....yet Everlasting_Joy
<Kurra> PAWS
<Dken2021> did winds knock out your window Zombert?
<Kurra> I mean ... ponies!
<Zombert> Well my Roommate was upstairs when it happand
<Panda|Drawing> Pink3 try the start bytton or escort the little one out of the room. Or mute the television and have him/her turn around ^^
<Panda|Drawing> Serenity ESRP standards ^^
<Serenity> I was talking about ESRP
<Kurra> Hooves!
<Kurra> put hooves!
<Cades> awesome
<Kurra> xD kick me
<Zombert> He said it was a pice of Metal sheeting from some ones shed or something
<BroPony|MEDIC> Hai Everypony ;)
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing Or, y'know, just get the kid out of the room and keep them out.
<Serenity> Zombert: Fluttershy's shed?
<Stormy`> Coming up with creative ideas is hard
<DashWithRainbows> Because kids ruin games
<Dken2021> ouch, glad he didn't get hit with it then
<DashWithRainbows> No matter what.
<Panda|Drawing> Serenity, my mistake. But no, nudity and other graphic content are M. Anything above that wouldnt be on shelves haha
<Stormy`> that's why if I ever wrote anything it would probably be fanfiction >.>
<Pink3> Panda|Drawing: ??? what lttle on :|
<Panda|Drawing> DWR, thats a good point ^^
<Zombert> Ya lol but it hit so hard that we need to replace the whole window frame
<Serenity> Panda|Drawing: Ahh okay.
<Panda|Drawing> Pink3 you said an 11 year old. there for little one.
<Dken2021> children + prized game collection = a bad time
<ACS13123> Jesus this is annoying.
<Serenity> I think the rudest game we ever let past was probably Conkers bad Fur Day
<ACS13123> Its not the worst
<Serenity> I know it's not
<MadSurge> Serenity: but that WAS a rude game :D
<Serenity> That's just first one that comes to mind
<Panda|Drawing> Serenity that game escaped my childhood :/ I dont even see how.
<Serenity> MadSurge: Only a little >:3
<ACS13123> For n64 standards...
<ACS13123> Maybe...
<artist> flaccid fexor Everlasting_Joy, that must be outlawed in most states
<Panda|Drawing> But in the 90's censorship rules were much different.
<Everlasting_Joy> artist: :D
<Cynder7> 6Indeed.. >.<
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/MRNKXIuPJTw
<Serenity> If Conker was released now, it would probably be banned in most countries
<Zombert> True
<Everlasting_Joy> artist: Than what the heck is the shake weight doing here?
<Dken2021> conker's just crude, not really anything to ban about
