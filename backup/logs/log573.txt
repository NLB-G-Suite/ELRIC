<pony_9001> than*
<Shamroc> aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnd chat got really fucking stupid all of a sudden..
<Soultu> why not just not think about it?

<GabeMoist> Firelight, some things are simply intolerable
<xxMoopyxx> Im not starting anything
<Silver_Storm> I dont even like talking about it
<Soultu> when you joke about something like that, you are still reminding people of it
<pony_5354> but there's a time frame needed before it can be made fun of
<Buytoast> well to be honest, someone did bring up the shootings
<oni_link> I don't see a point at poking fun at real life tragedies. Lets not bring that nonsense here
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica can we please drift away from the topic? It makes me uncomfortable
<pony_9001> IT's just me and my obscure sense of humor. I've gotta remember "normal" people don't find it as amusing.
<Buytoast> but the 9/11 was sudden i'll admit
<Spectrum_Rush|> we know xxMoopyxx

<Sumica> 00,10this guy has great covers
<Lunar_Brony> Big_Macintosh_1992 yes. It's not for the faint of heart. Rated mature for gore and swearing
<Derpy_Hooves> Silver_Storm and OohShiny: the "Yay"'s are actually coming from this: http://kyrospawn.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-Soundboard-V8-4-244757196
<GabeMoist> Buytoast, read up on them
<Spectrum_Rush|> sue soes Sumica
<Spectrum_Rush|> *does
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Lunar_Brony: pfft, faint of heart XD
<Reikim> Nyeh?

<Silver_Storm> at first i thought it was my phone cuz i got the same notification notice
<Buytoast> yeah yeah 'no profanity", "no rudeness", "LUV N TOLERAT"
<Firelight> I don't even think this guy plays guitar... Lol.
<Shizuka> 13not sure if i should knockout and timeban or just permaban and let them appeal it out
<oni_link> I like his Explorer. Explorer is best guitar
<Chachamuffin> sniffle...:(
<Shamroc> Buytoast: thats failure right there >been here for months >havnt read rules...
<Buytoast> so what's with the guitar videos
<Firelight> :O
<Lunar_Brony> xxMoopyxx I'm configuring with my toaster to play that when it starts up
<Spectrum_Rush|> you clearly did not read the rules
<Reikim> What did they do?
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast it's awesome
<Shizuka> 13very inappropriate jokes
<pony_9001> THe rules would be alot simpler if they just comprised of "Don't get the mods ticked off at you"
<xxMoopyxx> heh ok
*HatchetRyda hugs Chachamuffin "it'll be ok"
<pony_5354> this isn't the place for dark humor, just respect that. plz k thanks
<Sumica> 00,10guess no one knows this one
<Firelight> Buytoast: Is so tasty!!!
<oni_link> oh gawd G/S/C surfing theme!!!!!
<Chachamuffin> ...
<Buytoast> i get enough guitar with my brother all the time
<Shizuka> 13this isn't #brony, we have standards
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhh time ban probably
<Reikim> Timeban 'em. Let 'em cool their heels for a bit.
<Quick_Thinker> okay thats it if its just gonna be gutitars and arguing (i love gutars but im very tired so IM OUT EVERY PONY
<JESmith71> Pokemon surfing music
<Chachamuffin> :)
<Spectrum_Rush|> well said Shizuka
<Lunar_Brony> pony_9001 but then nopony would know how not to tick off the mods
<Firelight> @Shizuka: thank you!
<oni_link> Sumica: I guessed first
<Sumica> 00,10damn Shizuka, you realy are a pyro
<Buytoast> what happened to the showings of cowboy bebop and that accel world thing
<HatchetRyda> Chachamuffin: thats better lol
<Chachamuffin> Thanks Hatchet
<Buytoast> did those wrap up?
<Tovler> Hoenn Surf theme?
<xxMoopyxx> well there was video called YEAH TOAST1 based on TF2
<GabeMoist> pony_9001, even if that was the only rule, YOU STILL FAILED
<Reikim> It would probably be more effective than a permaban, in the long run. A permaban would get them angry and they'd either leave or whine about it in e-mail.
<HatchetRyda> no prob Chachamuffin
<Shizuka> 13all around the country, coast to coast
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka lemme guess. "Be polite. Be efficient. Have a plan to glomp everypony you meet."
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pony_9001 that's not a rule, that is called common sense
<Reikim> A timeban is more like a time-out.
<Quick_Thinker> good night everypony the ARGUEING GETS US NOTHING SO SO YALL LATER
<Spectrum_Rush|> GabeMoist: miserably at that
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Quick_Thinker
<HatchetRyda> night Quick_Thinker
*AttacktheAndalite is downloading an FiM soundboard on her phone.
<Sumica> 00,10this should be easy

<Firelight> <3
<Chachamuffin> cool
<pony_9001> Lord... maybe I'm just a troll at heart... I'm getting people mad at me and I'm not even trying to
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know that song
<AttacktheAndalite> night, Quick_Thinker
<Buytoast> if i keep egging people on, will i get banned again?
<pony_5354> is not mad
<Soultu> is it sadidk this one?
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast most likely
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well you could always kick him, drive him mad and let them make something dumb worth a permaban
<oni_link> Darn, I dont know this one
<CrimsonPhoenix> SIMS
<CrimsonPhoenix> THE SIMS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: People always say what do you like most?

<Chachamuffin> Crimson it depends on there nature about certain things. like how creepy stuff eeally shakes me up.
<HatchetRyda> SuperBrony64: i dont want to boast
<Reikim> Huh, and here I assumed you'd get tired of them after a while :P Well, deal with it as you see fit. I trust the Bronystate mods know what they're doing.

*OohShiny is afk
<Reikim> His shirt speaks to me: it says, "Can't let you brew that, Starbucks!"
<Spectrum_Rush|> CrimsonPhoenix: yes, yes you did
*Nittany_Discord 11,01bathes HatchetRyda
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MOBA sound familiar but i can't place it
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it makes me want to pirate the sims so much
<Firelight> O_____O
<oni_link> i refreshed stream to be more on time and it got loud as buck
<Lunar_Brony> Scottish_Molestia . . . and I thought Luna when she's drunk was a bad sign
<Reikim> Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. LoL and DotA
<Sumica> 00,10wth are you doing kirzstryfe?
<Tovler> You cannot grasp the true foam of this latte.

<HatchetRyda> Nittany_Discord: thanks, i needed that lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I can't play The Sims due to compatibility
<Modeabel> Can't let you sap that s
<Modeabel> p
<xxMoopyxx> there we go
<Reikim> Saturn: ...Insane?
*GabeMoist dusts Nittany_Discord
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I mean THE ORIGINAL
<RAWRity> so, how long does this go on for?
<CrimsonPhoenix> The ONLY good one
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts GabeMoist
<MirrorImage> Borderlands won the steam sale vote, fyi
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: what about running it in compatiblity mode
*Lunar_Brony is insane
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I can't play the sims because it bores me
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: iiiinsaaaaayayayayayayane!
<oni_link> wily stage 2
<Reikim> I can't handle MMOs, for whatever reason. Too much commitment required.
<oni_link> mm2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> kirzstryfe: ikr
<Firelight> Think of coffee as Hot chocolate mad from Canada.
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a mode like that in Win 7?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Hello everybody
<Reikim> I RECOGNIZE WILY THEME
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and there goes borderlands with a 75% discount
<Firelight> made*
<Reikim> MM2 Wily Castle FTW
<Lunar_Brony> hi Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
*Reikim rocks the hell out
<RAWRity> because to be honest, this whole video just sort of melted together into one long, mediocre guitar solo a while ago.
<Soultu> megaman XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone ping me.
<RAWRity> Like a Metallica album.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Nittany_Discord:

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord:
<Sumica> 00,10another easy one
<kirzstryfe> I liked the first Guild Wars, the 2nd won't have a monthly fee, and I plan on being casual for it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks.
<Lunar_Brony> Firelight what? I pinged him
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, you right click on the program and click on troubleshoot compatibilty
<Reikim> RAWRity: We're watching it mostly to spot the game tunes
<Firelight> Can I ask a favore to? Ping me please?
<oni_link> stilll alive
<Firelight> I'm bored.

<xxMoopyxx> oh no here we go
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MW3 didn't win ;~;
<oni_link> i said the song name first :P
<Reikim> Eh, I just can't do MMOs. I've been through a couple, none of them stick.
<Buytoast> did borderlands win?
<ponibas> what did?
<Evil_Spike> Wow, been a while since I was on here
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, You don't need that re-harsh
<MirrorImage> Borderlands won
*Lunar_Brony uses Firelight as a Ping Pong ball
<Buytoast> YES
<GabeMoist> It's ok SuperBrony64
<Buytoast> BORDERLANDS
<Reikim> No draw. I think it's the format; no real all-consuming story.
<xxMoopyxx> Yes it didn't win HA! i know it sucked
<Buytoast> now i can buy it
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Borderlands is more fun
<Firelight> Superbrony64: MLP Won.. MLP ALWAYS Wins..
<Modeabel> Mirror's Edge's Still Alive < Portal's Still Alive
<Reikim> Too many sidequests that don't really mean anything.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SuperBrony64: Dammit.
<Reikim> Too much time spent collecting twenty bear asses.
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - gotta give it a half hour for the old sale to expire, of courser
<Buytoast> eh
<oni_link> did ya try the troubleshooting CrimsonPhoenix
<Buytoast> i can wait
<oni_link> ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, not now
<oni_link> k
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't even have the game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i think the last mmo i played was Ragnarok
<oni_link> lol
<Lunar_Brony> Borderlands is awesome
<Lunar_Brony> hands down
<xxMoopyxx> Cans.wave
<MirrorImage> looks like i'm going to get out of steam summer sales relatively unscathed though...
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't wait for Borderlands 2
<MirrorImage> got Just Cause 2 for $5, and i'll grab Borderlands for $7.50
<oni_link> MirrorImage: Me too, twenty bucks is all i spent
<Buytoast> if you haven't bought the binding of issac yet you obviously don't like fun
<MirrorImage> and that'll be the only damage, minus anything awesome tomorrow
<GabeMoist> Anyone get Recettear?
<kirzstryfe> I do
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> had a good time too, small server and i was one of the 5 people who play priest lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> SOMEONE MUST STREAM RECETTEAR
<Vinco> xxMoopyxx: Why the cans.wav rage?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6well, I already had it
<CrimsonPhoenix> BEST GAME
<Reikim> Eh, the only thing I bought recently was Bayonetta. That one was fun.
<Lunar_Brony> the only thing I bought during the sale was "Poker Night at the Inventory"
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: i have it as well..
<Evil_Spike> Borderlands is only $7.50?
<xxMoopyxx> i don't know
<Lunar_Brony> kirzstryfe had what?
<GabeMoist> I got a Game Over on Recettear ;____;
<Buytoast> now i just got to delete duke nukem forever off my computer
<kirzstryfe> 8,6not sure if it would handle streaming well, think it only has a fullscreen option
<GabeMoist> I lost my house
<Firelight> More ponies?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> kirzstryfe, I saw it streamed
<CrimsonPhoenix> Portal 2 Now you're gone
<oni_link> lol portal 2
<Firelight> Nope.
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast KILL IT! KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I WIN
<oni_link> darn it
<MirrorImage> Civ 5 Gods and Kings is 25% off - is that as low as it's been?
<oni_link> eeyup
<Buytoast> eh, i enjoyed duke nukem forever
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Recettear is fun, but definitely needs a solid block of time to kill if you want to play
<Buytoast> i wouldn't reccomend it
<Buytoast> or replay it
<GabeMoist> kirzstryfe, Recettear should have windowed
<Buytoast> but it was fun for a run
<berrygreyandbloodyte> oh u gotta luv portal
<Soultu> want you gone
<Modeabel> LittleBigPlanet Karting Beta
<Spectrum_Rush|> CrimsonPhoenix: don't glout
<Lunar_Brony> Portal 2? IDK
<Soultu> is the actual title
<Reikim> I hear Want You Gone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can get into Recettear in spurts.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush|, it's all in good fun
<Spectrum_Rush|> :P
<Firelight> Friend Asks what's your favorite animal. Accadentaly Says Fluttershy. :[
<Lunar_Brony> I don't play enough games like that
<CrimsonPhoenix> don't worry I'm good sport
<Lunar_Brony> Firelight Fluttershy is a tree, silly filly!
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: is a RD :D but a good sport
<Reikim> Firelight: But it's truuuuue.
<kirzstryfe> that's one nice thing about gw2, has a personal story system for each character based on the starting choices you make
<GabeMoist> I also got Dungeon Defenders
<Firelight> Lunar_Brony: .....................Oh.
<Reikim> Nah, MMO plots really don't draw me.
<kirzstryfe> plus all of the side quests are "pick one of 5 different things, do any mix of them in a certain area"
<Reikim> I mean theoretically they would, but I can't muster the suspension of disbelief.
<Sumica> 00,10one last song
<oni_link> k
<Reikim> No MMO can perfectly recreate the feeling of being in a fantasy world.
<Soultu> now i only want you gone
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is it
<CrimsonPhoenix> the final song
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: Minus the Sea Ponies outro?
<Lunar_Brony> this is . ..
<CrimsonPhoenix> HEAVEN OR HELL LET'S ROCK
<Lunar_Brony> THE FINAL COUNTDOWN
<HatchetRyda> Sumica: let it be long as hell lol
<Reikim> And too much dealing with stupid players standing around in squares trying to play the game like some kind of sport.
<Soultu> now i only want you gone
<Soultu> :D
<oni_link> chill out
<oni_link> dr mario
<oni_link> buck yeah
<Spectrum_Rush|> uh
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, cheater
<Reikim> I prefer single player adventures because of the greater control over the narrative.
<Lunar_Brony> HatchetRyda then let it be a Meat Loaf song
<oni_link> lol
<Firelight> This guy.. I hate him so much. He is a douchebag. He dosn't even play in every one of his videos.. HE just plays the song and makes it look like he is singing it.. Sorry for hating.. But it's true.
<CrimsonPhoenix> you answered before I could hear it
<Reikim> Hmm...
<Reikim> This song
<Firelight> Singing? PLaying*
<Firelight> LOL
<HatchetRyda> Lunar_Brony: or a metallica lol
<Sumica> 00,10singing?
<kirzstryfe> I love great single player rpg's, but I don't have enough time to really get into them the way I used to
<Firelight> @Sumica: Ikr?
<Modeabel> dr mario?
<Lunar_Brony> HatchetRyda true
<Lunar_Brony> very true
<oni_link> Modeabel: yep
<kirzstryfe> and I haven't seen many pop up lately that seemed worth picking up
<Buytoast> i don't even know who this freak is, all i know is that something is making these screeching sounds
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hesitated on Dungeon Defenders. Don't think I'll play that enough.
<Buytoast> i'll play it with you
<Buytoast> trust me
<Reikim> Same here.
<Reikim> Especially the ones that kick you in the ass repeatedly. Many strategy RPGs.
<Reikim> Fire Emblem repeatedly pisses me off.
<oni_link> youre a doctor
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link I was gonna say that . . .
<Reikim> The last RPG I actually completed...was Final Fantasy 6. Now there's a game with a fun system.
<Modeabel> Medic Mario
<Evil_Spike> Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Magicka or Borderlands?
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, I originally wasn't going to get it, but my brother made me
<Sumica> 00,10Wow Buytoast you are quite the judgemental poS arnt you
<cratorkid> all three
<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: lol great minds think alike :D
<Reikim> Evil_Spike: Human Revolution.
<Buytoast> i am
<Buytoast> but then again
<Buytoast> i'm also an asshole
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm still waiting for the next "Tales of" game to realese in america
<Evil_Spike> Can't, only $15 in my Steam Wallet
<Phase4> 00,02Evil_Spike, deus ex
*Reikim laughs
<Evil_Spike> Righto
<kirzstryfe> [02:39] <Buytoast> i'm also an asshole
<kirzstryfe> 8,6couldn't tell :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i forget that many don't like JRPG
<Starflash> :O
<Reikim> Well that's as much an admission of guilt as you can get.
<Reikim> I love them
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link IMPOSSIBRU!! If they did, you would be 15 and skipping down a busy street while listening to "Smile Smile Smile"
<Reikim> They just kind of melt together after a while
<Reikim> take loads of time to complete
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You should make a wallet out of things other than condensed hot water.
<Reikim> and on top of that the good ones, like Tales, never get localized.
<Shizuka> 13taking too much restraint to not timeban buytoast now..
<Lunar_Brony> and not giving one buck about other's opinions
<Starflash> Hmm, Nittany_Discord, Dungeon defenders is actually pretty nice. Got a good build up and stuff
<Phase4> 00,02Evil_Spike, if you can get the collection thats even better
<Modeabel> Sad Sad Sad
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey?
<oni_link> oh mah god i said we should watch this earlier!
<Reikim> If you're having to restrain yourself, go for it.
<Starflash> just lots and lots of content that you need to buy <___<
<CrimsonPhoenix> This ain't Seaponies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well he did say he was banned before
<richfiles> Awesome anime :)
<Buytoast> but on a more serious note Dungeon defenders is pretty entertaining if you have people to play it with
<Buytoast> otherwise it's dull
<Reikim> He's obviously being an asshole if you've got one finger on the ban-noodle.
<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: I would but G4 wasnt around when I was 15 :P
<Starflash> nah
<richfiles> LOL dat silly Applejack
<pony95901> what anime is this from?
<Reikim> Anyway, Tales
<Vinco> CrimsonPhoenix: Those are coming
<xxMoopyxx> Oh do not even start with that crap dude don't even start with that shit
<Reikim> Loved Tales of Symphonia, even though I never completed it.
<thegt90> this is samuri shamploo
<Buytoast> alright what chinese game show is this supposed to be?
<oni_link> pony95901: Samurai Champloo
<HatchetRyda> pony95901: samurai champloo
<Reikim> Endearing art style, quality writing for a JRPG
<oni_link> dari bot is best pony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> last one i played was tales of vesperia
<thegt90> well sorry caint spell worth a damn
<richfiles> FlutterFu
<Reikim> I still haven't gotten around to Samurai Champloo.
<Firelight> Squee?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i enjoy the combat system
<Soultu> YES
<Reikim> I tried to do Tales of Phantasia, but too much effort...plus I kept screwing up my savestate.

<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, he got to the moon, now he faces his next greatest challenge: Climbing ladders
<oni_link> TheRandomkid321: good luck :)
<DIZZYRATCHET> ssssss luna landing remindes me of black ops
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, that may be true, but now he cant get into the ship in the first place :)
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, i think Sumica made it
<Evil_Spike> Are we streaming any shows anymore?
<oni_link> richfiles: im sorry to hear that, hope things get better soon

<Reactor> night, berrygreyandbloodyte
<oni_link> that rocket is a beast o.o
<cher3ry> those new solids may be a lot taller, but they sure last just as short a time

<Reactor> DIZZYRATCHET: And someone knows where my name comes from. Didn't expect that.
<DIZZYRATCHET> i beat reactor in 3 seconds
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<Buytoast> it's spinning like it's in swan lake or something hot damn
<Reactor> DIZZYRATCHET: He was the best boss.
<DIZZYRATCHET> 4real
<bob> holy crap its going for the base
<bob> nvm its fine :#

<DIZZYRATCHET> random how i got that reactor thing in my head
<cher3ry> parachute plus rocket. Problem, physics?
<oni_link> hahahaha
<Reactor> DIZZYRATCHET: I honestly never expected anyone to get the reference
<bob> its a smokey
<creeperhugger10> ok moopy
<oni_link> bronystate is a cool place, it entertains me and doesnt afraid of anything
<Buytoast> at least fall off the ladder and break a leg
<DIZZYRATCHET> it was random. u really got it from ratchet and clank
<cher3ry> I wonder... morosely...
<bob> its breaks...
<adasdad1> lol
<cher3ry> if the addition of the ladder added just enough dissymmetry to throw off rockets.
<oni_link> how does it move???
<Buytoast> waht in the
<bob> roll away home with you
<richfiles> Roll to the launch pad
<crazypony> lol
<Phase4> 00,02well i dont know why this wont work
<bob> USE PIE
<Reactor> DIZZYRATCHET: I really did
<bob> maybe they little guys are secretly messing with ur rocket when your not looking
<Rain> try turning on your rcs this time?
<DIZZYRATCHET> did not see that coming
<oni_link> bob: scumbag kerbals :D
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Is there stream
<Chrysalis> hey guys
<bob> :D
<Chrysalis> hai Phase stream
<cher3ry> they sorta look like they could be gremlins, I suppose.
<Reactor> JRP2234[iPhone]: There is stream
<oni_link> JRP2234[iPhone]: yep Phase is streaming Kerbal Space Program
<DIZZYRATCHET> hi Chrysalis
<bob> ah i know there plan now
<xxMoopyxx> Sumica.........im gonna go watch MLP for a little bit ok so talk to you in a little while ok sorry about the big chat fight that you had to hear
<DIZZYRATCHET> ok moopy
<Spectrum_Rush|> Phase4: the developers know you are a master at this game , so they introduced a special coding that will make your rockets just fail repeatedly
<bob> gru sent the minions to take phase's rocket parts
<Rain> so many oks and so few punctuation
<creeperhugger10> youR write bob, when something goes wrong, always add pie :D!!!!!!!!........ unlesss that object is potentially explosive. oh.
<richfiles> I'm calling it a night. Gonna shower and crash. Chat next week! :)
<xxMoopyxx> Just to calm me down for a bit
<oni_link> Spectrum_Rush|: which is why his patch failed the last time :D
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|, :O
<bob> yes pie always solves the answer XD
<Chrysalis> what on earth?
<Chrysalis> new KSP update?
<DIZZYRATCHET> bye richfiles
<Soultu> gtg bye
<oni_link> Chrysalis: eeyup
<oni_link> bye Soultu
<DIZZYRATCHET> bye u to
<Spectrum_Rush|> don't worry Phase4 ya'll can some stupid little coding likety split :)
<Chrysalis> omg they can escape :O
<Spectrum_Rush|> *beat
<DIZZYRATCHET> minions
<Phase4> 00,02making sure ladder works
<Chrysalis> thats amazing
<Buytoast> i wish i had this game just so i could launch these little santa's rejects off from 5k meters in the air
<bob> maybe the kerbal is heavy that it throws the rocket off lol
<creeperhugger10> when your sad... fix it, with PIE. when your mad... fix it with PIE, hard mathproblem, fix it.... with PIE. handling explosive, fix it with.... actually, not such a good idea
<DIZZYRATCHET> fly to luna
<Buytoast> do they scream or is this game a quiet one?
<cher3ry> the ladder is my half-baked theory. I'll explore it myself in a couple days when my new comp gets here xD
<Chrysalis> Math problems dont get fixed with pie
*Rain curls up next to Shizu and tries to get some sleep..
<Chrysalis> they get fixed with pi
<killerpony7733> They may add sounds to them possibly ya never know
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Who is streaming
<bob> pi
<killerpony7733> JRP2234[iPhone]: Phase
<Chrysalis> JRP2234[iPhone] Phase4 is currently streaming
<creeperhugger10> chrysalis, i was talking about mathimatical pie.... 3.1415926
*Shizuka 13throws a blanket over rain rain~<3
<Chrysalis> creeperhugger10 thats pi

<bob> i think they are shy a lil
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I believe they mix up the lyrics
<creeperhugger10> :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
<bob> i can see it
<Buytoast> It wouldn't be bad if they had a stage. And music. And other people around them. And props.
<Buytoast> It wouldn't be bad if it were bad.
<bob> they need derpy
<oni_link> Well, I give them props for even doing this
<bob> derpy will atract a crowd
<Buytoast> if it weren't bad.
<Reactor> They're not too bad

*Shamroc pucnhes creeperhugger10 "stop bugging Rain"
<DIZZYRATCHET> it will explode
<DIZZYRATCHET> twice
<cher3ry> explosions aren't uncool, though, so its fitting
<Spectrum_Rush|> this can only end well
<Reactor> DIZZYRATCHET: probably
<bob> well i will test it then put the sticker on :$
<oni_link> mine would be the ss derp
<creeperhugger10> wow, fickle crowd. :(

<Reactor> Chrysalis: I thought it was
<creeperhugger10> what type of question is that, why dont you scroll up and check what has been fickle
<bob> i thought they added stickers already becuase in the new trailer they have "how hard can rocket science be anyway"
<Chrysalis> well, free on origin
<Reactor> Here we go
<Modeabel> I would play LBPK Beta
<Reactor> and... dead
<Modeabel> WTF?

<oni_link> DIZZYRATCHET: i miss the gummi builder

<Chrysalis> those gummi ship fights were better than the rest of the game
<Spectrum_Rush|> DIZZYRATCHET: its not just guns
<Modeabel> MY CHILDHOOD
<bob> it flies @_@
<oni_link> Chrysalis: i dunno about that but it was freaking awesome nonetheless
<creeperhugger10> wel saying that i live in a cave, it is extremely creative
<Rain> I honestly wonder how you could have possibly thought of such a rhyme
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain he is cool like that ?
<DIZZYRATCHET> .... suspence
<bob> its moving @_@
<oni_link> So much hostility today >~>
<Chrysalis> and such a slow spin
<bob> i like to log on to bronystate at night becuase ppl arent crazy at night
<cher3ry> we're not crazy?
<DIZZYRATCHET> yup
<Chrysalis> depends on where you are when "night" counts
<Chrysalis> its probably morning for most here
<bob> in the afternoon ppl text a new message every 4 secs
<creeperhugger10> im pretty insane, sry
<bob> its like @_@ omg
<cher3ry> technically 1:30 is "morning" I suppose.
<oni_link> bob: even tonight thoug, its usually more calm than this
<bob> yea
<Chrysalis> well its a weekend
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis 03:32 here ...
<Reactor> 4:30 am here
<Chrysalis> time for eurobronies to do nothin at all
<bob> same
<DIZZYRATCHET> to spaaaaace
<killerpony7733> 10:32AM here
<oni_link> 1:32 here
<Chrysalis> 0932 here
<creeperhugger10> finally ive stopped being pinged for everytime someone used my name
<bob> its 900394394 over here
<crazypony> 4:33am here
<oni_link> bob: Its over nine thousannnnnnnd
<DIZZYRATCHET> 3:33 am
<bob> I KNOW ITS AMAZING
<Souporcat> 1:33
<bob> XD
<creeperhugger10> 433 east coast
<creeperhugger10> USA i mean
<Reactor> creeperhugger10: No, you still get pinged.
<DIZZYRATCHET> 9000 is lucky #
<Modeabel> 1 34 here
<bob> im from mars thats why
<bob> lol
<Rain> think thats annoying, creeperhugger10? try getting a ping every time someone decides to talk about the weather or "chocolate rain" :\
<oni_link> bob: mars has its own time zone and rules haha
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Phase4> 00,02big rockets dont have much fuel
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<oni_link> wouldnt they have to capitalize it like this though, Rain?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: That makes no sense big rockets should have more fuel
<creeperhugger10> it makes an obnoxious "ding" when someone types your name
<Rain> oni_link, no
<bob> use piss for fuel
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> chocolate Rain some stay dry and other feel the pain ~
<DIZZYRATCHET> ding
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, well theres more actual fuel but less you can do with it
<oni_link> really? that annoying then
<killerpony7733> Hm interesting
<oni_link> *thats
<cher3ry> fuel went up but so did mass, ends up a tradeoff.
<Rain> I get it any time someone says rain. no matter the caps. it could be raIn and it would still do it
<oni_link> wow, that really sucks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain if you use mIRC or some other client you can configure the pings to be cap sensitive
<Rain> yeah I know
<oni_link> whats a good IRC client for android anyways?
<bob> >_> my dad just walked in then stared at me agian >_>
<cher3ry> or you could do as I do. Make up a name people are unlikely to type in casual conversation. xD
<creeperhugger10> my guinea pig is chewing on my toes
<Chrysalis> you can also set up extra things to count as pings
<Rain> but then I wouldnt get anything when Shizu says rain rain
<Spectrum_Rush|> funny i'm only pinged when Spectrum_Rush| infull is typed
<cher3ry> well, technically I stole it, but still
<Phase4> 00,02this rockets gona be slow
<creeperhugger10> rain
<Rain> yes, Chrysalis, I know
<creeperhugger10> rain
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain add rain~ and that should do the trick
<Spectrum_Rush|> rain
<bob> i get pinged when somoene says spongebob
<creeperhugger10> rain
<bob> or bobbed thier heads
<creeperhugger10> ding ding ding!
<Rain> you know, nick spamming is kickable
<DIZZYRATCHET> why do some of us have "odd" pets
<Spectrum_Rush|> we wub you to Rain
<Shamroc> creeperhugger10: dude leave her alone man...
<creeperhugger10> 3 times not in all caps isnt really spamming
<cher3ry> I don't have an odd pet. But my cat has a pet human. :/
<DIZZYRATCHET> i got pet tank
<oni_link> Spectrum_Rush|: thats what baffles me, i only get ping'd when people use my name with the underscore
<Spectrum_Rush|> it is annoying though
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys i have something to tell you all
<creeperhugger10> wow, more fickleness
<DIZZYRATCHET> yes a toy tank that i programmed
<Rain> it doesnt have to be all caps for it to be spam. just saying.
<Reactor> what's that, xxMoopyxx
<DIZZYRATCHET> yes?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 a deep life changing revelation
<cher3ry> dat accelleration
<creeperhugger10> 3 times just one word spaced out does nt really count as spam

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anti bronies don't watch MLP ? who knew this ? does obama know ?
<DIZZYRATCHET> he said he wont when he did
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<oni_link> dat lunar orbit Phase4
<xxMoopyxx> Ugh........well his youtube channel name is TZB43
<Rain> how uninteresting
<DIZZYRATCHET> luna time
<adasdad1> almost there!..
<bob> Phase4 how are you able to control in map
<creeperhugger10> im not saying they cant think that, or i get a choice, but my opinion is its not really spam and if it was, very minor
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc get your sarcasm detector fixed btw
<Phase4> 00,02bob, thing on the bottim
<Phase4> 00,02bottom'
<cher3ry> if you raise the navball you can pilot from map mode
<Phase4> 00,02click the small grey arrow
<bob> oh
<Rain> its all good anyway, creeperhugger10
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah...i think i busted it when i was trollin the hell outa an anti-brony on tf2....do you know any-pony i can ask to get it fixed?
<Phase4> 00,02orbit or land?
<Rain> land
<oni_link> xxMoopyxx: it sounds like a closet brony, theres more of them than you think
<creeperhugger10> ok :[
<DIZZYRATCHET> im a troll in BF3
<Phase4> 00,02well i meen orbit then land or just land
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc nope
<bob> land
<creeperhugger10> lag
<Phase4> 00,02land it is
<Rain> you can ping me all you want from here on out and I wont give a damn ^_^
<DIZZYRATCHET> closet bronies hum
<bob> iv never been to mun
<cher3ry> mun is a silly place really.
<DIZZYRATCHET> luna
<cher3ry> Been all over it, haven't seen one dark maned alicorn.
*oni_link doesn't abuse the ping system
<bob> i wonder mars is called in this game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain can i ping you cause you're awesome :D ?
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<cher3ry> no mars yet, unless it's in the new update
<Rain> I guess >_>
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: can i ping you cause YOUR awesome? oh wait no i cant...your not awesome hehe
<bob> sram thats the new mars in kerbal XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain you're awesome :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc you just did :p
<Spectrum_Rush|> Phase4: i've got the gifs on hand :)
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no i didnt....your insane!
<xxMoopyxx> And this is what he said "sonic rainboom? No. /totally not watching every single one of these commentaries in reverse order instead of doing homework" thats what he said
<Shamroc> see i was right AHA!
<cher3ry> bob yes, fits the naming theme, along with labrek :P
<DIZZYRATCHET> land now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc again :p
<creeperhugger10> messaged on steam
<Phase4> 00,02not much power in this rocket
<Phase4> 00,02might not be able to get home
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT
<Chrysalis> have you guys seen the This Day Aria literal?
<Rain> there, now I might be able to get some sleep now that I dont have to deal with creeperhugger10
<oni_link> Phase4: if you had followed the orbit first, what would have been the benefit of doing so?
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, not sure
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc u sure ? i can swear you are pinging me ...
<cher3ry> man advantage to setting up an orbit is being able to better pick a landing zone.
<creeperhugger10> oh, was i typing too LOUD? lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Rain Sleep well
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT...no your just insane...like i inb4'ed eairlier..
<Rain> night, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<bob> otulp= pluto
<creeperhugger10> bye rain
<xxMoopyxx> well he posted that comment
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc okay ...
<DIZZYRATCHET> night rain and GPT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm not going anywhere btw
<Rain> Im not sure if TheGreatAndPowerfulT is going to bed
<DIZZYRATCHET> ok sorry
<Reactor> bob: but Pluto isn't a planet, silly :)
<oni_link> sleep tight Rain
<DIZZYRATCHET> pluto is best planet
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<bob> ah who cars it kerbal anything is possible : D
<cher3ry> its more of a planet than I am.
<creeperhugger10> i havnt slept for 20 years
<Reactor> cher3ry: That is true.
<Phase4> 00,02SHIT
<Shamroc> creeperhugger10: must be a robot...
<xxMoopyxx> But its a good thing that i did not become a anti brony
<bob> @_@
<DIZZYRATCHET> cyberpony
<oni_link> bob: mars is sram?
<Phase4> 00,02too fast
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if live
<bob> i just made that up
<Spectrum_Rush|> D:
<bob> XD
<Phase4> 00,02oh wow
<Reactor> "COMING IN HOT!"
<bob> EJECTS @_@
<oni_link> bob: you had me fooled :D
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol what if it explodes
<Phase4> 00,02lucky
<cher3ry> dat weak thrust
<bob> : P
<creeperhugger10> im not robot, apature science test subject escaped.
<bob> that thrust is probrably for rover
<DIZZYRATCHET> BOOOOOOOOM
<oni_link> so is that yellow meter the fuel?
<Phase4> 00,02now we play the waiting game
<creeperhugger10> disregard my last commend if you dont know portal
<DIZZYRATCHET> tictoc
<Aps> xmasskills,

<noname> dem tabs
<adasdad1> one small mstep for kerbal, one giant leap for kerbkind!
<DIZZYRATCHET> speech
<Shamroc> ALL THEM LUNA PICS
<bob> YAY
<Buytoast> er, what
<DIZZYRATCHET> ikr
<oni_link> all my love <3
<bob> luna approoves the landing
<cher3ry> they came to explore in peace, and now there they shall rest in peace. wait, wrong speech, damnit!
<Major> So many Lunas <3<3<3<3
<oni_link> cher3ry: :D
<DIZZYRATCHET> ikr
<Spectrum_Rush|> i do it evry time
<bob> o.o
<Reactor> Oh, yeah. Yesterday was the 43rd anniversary of the moon landing
<bob> XD hes gonna do it
<creeperhugger10> <3PORTAL,<3 companion cube,<3 bronies
<Reactor> wait...
<bob> here he goes @_@
<oni_link> lmao :D
<DIZZYRATCHET> im ready
<bob> this is so FUN
<bob> XDDDD
<killerpony7733> HERE IT COMES!
<DIZZYRATCHET> :)
<Major> :D
<bob> LOL
<oni_link> lmao
<Reactor> Or fall
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<Major> XD
<bob> YAY
<cher3ry> dat leap
<Spectrum_Rush|> :D
<oni_link> it was really well synced before he fell on his back :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> now to find Luna
<crazypony> woo hoo
<oni_link> dat jetpack
<DIZZYRATCHET> where luna
<bob> i can see the multiplayer now
<DIZZYRATCHET> speech
<bob> the other ppl can ride in ur rocket and explore and build a base
<DIZZYRATCHET> nice walk
<Reactor> bob: 0x10^c
<cher3ry> "getting bored of space"
<bob> Phase4 weres the kerbal flag
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4 in charge of Rocket Science
<Rain> Phase4
<DIZZYRATCHET> space the final frontier
<creeperhugger10> yahhhnnnnn
<Rain> walk to the dark side of the mun and see if he freezes
<bob> i heard about that game Reactor
<oni_link> bob: you should pitch your ideas to the dev team o,o
<DIZZYRATCHET> not the cold
<bob> i know right o.o
<cher3ry> wot
<DIZZYRATCHET> where to next
<oni_link> ksp multiplayer would be epic and mun bases :;)
<bob> next we go to cheeze world XD
<DIZZYRATCHET> yay
<bob> dont forget the mun rocks phase
<cher3ry> ok, quickly, cut his O2 tank!
<Reactor> So... do they realise that they probably won't be getting home?
<creeperhugger10> can i put the moon i a cheese grader?
<cher3ry> make it look like an accident
<DIZZYRATCHET> how will he get out
<MahBoi777> MOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<bob> lol
<DIZZYRATCHET> dat jetpack
<bob> group pic yay
<oni_link> bob: cheeseworld final boss http://www.i-mockery.com/romhacks/smb2-xmas/mouser.gif
<creeperhugger10> rocks arent very comfy
<cher3ry> dad, are you mun?
<bob> XD
<MadSurge> Why is the "flash policy daemon" suddendly angry at me? .__.
<bob> that mouse
<Reactor> You have to leave at least one kerbal there, otherwise someone might jack your rocket.
<oni_link> bob, ikr XD
<DIZZYRATCHET> luna wants out
<somepony_else> hi everypony
<Reactor> Hi, somepony_else
<bob> kermah?
<cher3ry> who's gonna steal our rocket? We're on the friggin mun! We're the only ones he... oh hell.
<oni_link> cher3ry: *deeper voice* no son, but you are the best at space and i am proud of you
<DIZZYRATCHET> hi somepony_else
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think i can get them home
<crazypony> hi somepony_else
<Phase4> oh
<oni_link> hello somepony_else
<Phase4> thats something else
<creeperhugger10> pwndy
<DIZZYRATCHET> luna will steal
<Phase4> your behind a proxy most likley
<cher3ry> maybe they can get escape velocity with their infinite but puny jetpacks.
<oni_link> Phase4: theyre stranded?
<Reactor> cher3ry: There is a lot you don't know...
<Phase4> small button in the bottom right, switch to iris
<bob> Phase4 do what apollo did
<creeperhugger10> im not a pony.....
<somepony_else> hi Reactor , DIZZYRATCHET, crazypony and oni_link
<bob> top hanks got them home
<bob> tom*
<Phase4> but your here so :/
<oni_link> lmao :D
<Buytoast> and now they shall suffer forever, trapped within a hell of their own ambition
<Buytoast> such is the price of fame
<Phase4> 00,02bob, unfortunately i dont have tom hanks
<Reactor> bob: But they were already in orbit
<bob> no tom hanks ;_;
<oni_link> somepony_else: how are you this day/morning/afternoon/evening ?
<somepony_else> aks luna to bring them back
<Rain> build another rocket, name a crew member tom hanks, send him to save everybody
<DIZZYRATCHET> celestia funded this?
<somepony_else> fine, thanks. how are you, oni_link?
<bob> yea name a crew member tom hanks or forrest gump
<cher3ry> my .13 rockets were named Celestia. My .15s were Lunas. I'll need a new theme for the .16s I guess.
<Rain> you should leave one there, Phase4. see if he builds a colony
<oni_link> somepony_else: im having a blast here relaxing with everyone. and tomorrow i got to the lake with my parents to beat the heat
<bob> imagine he just sits there and the russian space crew just waves at them
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<creeperhugger10> no, it was terry pratchet that steered them back to earth, id be surpried if anyone knew that
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma start going home
<Reactor> cher3ry: You could always go for classical mathematicians
<Phase4> 00,02this will not work but worth a try
<oni_link> bob: that would be soo funny but so cruel :D
<Rain> can you space walk without being on land?
<creeperhugger10> no
<bob> just call tom hanks phase he will giude you @_@
<Rain> if so, you can totally get them home with their infinite fuel jet packs
<cher3ry> Might have to, since there was a madness to my method... my main goal in .13 became to crash into the Sun (impossible as it turned out to be). In .15, it was to land everywhere.
<oni_link> Rain: IKR
<Rain> landing might be a problem though
<creeperhugger10> you have to be able to have some projection, laws of physics
<Rain> creeperhugger10, their jet packs...
<cher3ry> dat thrust.
<Reactor> Rain: Reentry could be a problem
<bob> but rain they dont have parachutes remember
<DIZZYRATCHET> she see 'em trolling she hating........
<Aps> xmasskills,
<Phase4> 00,02this is about as efficent as i can be
<Rain> I said that, bob
<bob> oh ._.
<DIZZYRATCHET> riding dirty
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<Rain> they could be buried on their home planet though. or turned to ash on the way
*Rain shrugs
<bob> why are they screaming they are only going like 2 miles per hour :3
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<oni_link> bob: space is scurry :D
<cher3ry> because they're only going 2 mph and home is very far away and they forgot to pee before they left
<Phase4> 00,02i might be wrong
<bob> how many days has he been in space
<Phase4> 00,02and we have plenty of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02bob, 2
<creeperhugger10> , theyre using jeypacks?, cheeters, and anyway "WALKING"involvs solid ground under one foot at all time
<bob> ._. wow demo times flies
<oni_link> to the mun and leaving in 2 days? awesome
<cher3ry> to escape, yes. To get back home, that remains to be seen.
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02completly wrong way to take off
<bob> @.@
<cher3ry> zois and n-body problems.
<DIZZYRATCHET> time for the sun
<creeperhugger10> freeze
<Reactor> I frequently have dreams that I'm working on a moon colony.
<DIZZYRATCHET> y
<MadSurge> Flash hates me! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<oni_link> MadSurge: it hates me too but welcome :D
<bob> hes actually using tom hanks logic @_@
<oni_link> :D
<cher3ry> as long as you can get it below 70km you'll eventually get home
<creeperhugger10> whos flash? eems legit
<Rain> no bob, thats just physics
<DIZZYRATCHET> we see 'em rolling
<Reactor> Rain: Didn't Tom Hanks invent physics?
<Rain> :|
<MadSurge> Also, deployable kerbals? They're new to me!
<Reactor> :|
<bob> lol
<bob> he made it home
<MadSurge> Hey Rain!
<oni_link> MadSurge: yeah Phase got the update
<creeperhugger10> orbite is csed byy the force of gravity in a circular ring, base on mass of orbiting object. and yes, its rocket science
<Phase4> 00,02lolwat
<oni_link> kerbals can moonwalk and use jetpacks and lights and exit ship
<Phase4> 00,02aparently if you time warp you phase through planets
<cher3ry> you shifted into a higher parabolic orbit, technically.
<Rain> hello, MadSurge
<cher3ry> it's projecting your path as if you had taken off on it
<Reactor> Well that can't be good
<adasdad1> woohoo, successful moon mission is almost successful!
<DIZZYRATCHET> easy way to get to earth: blow UP
<bob> yay he made it home
<oni_link> dam physics, you scary
<cher3ry> that dinky rocket ain't gonna help
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<bob> NOON ONONONON
<bob> dont crash
<MadSurge> WEEEEEEEEEEEEE *BOOM*
<Reactor> ouch
<bob> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<noname> ded
<adasdad1> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<bob> ;_;
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol
<BronyInstrumental> hey ponies :)
<crazypony> NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Rain> I.. think you forgot to put a chute on, Phase4
<MadSurge> Well, at least we delivered Luna her pizza :D
<bob> man he used the speech and then he crashed ;_;
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, no, i had a chute
<Phase4> 00,02tried to use it
<Rain> then you broke it
<Phase4> 00,02and then it exploded
<Rain> XD
<oni_link> let us have a moment of silence for those brave kerbals
<DIZZYRATCHET> sup bronyinstrumental
<MadSurge> Exploding parachute XD
<bob> thst speech was the best part XD
<Chrysalis> Phase4 you ever tried to program without booleans?
<Chrysalis> its a PITA
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, wait
<DIZZYRATCHET> that was funny:D
<Reactor> Well, it's past 5am here.
<Phase4> 00,02your trying to program without?
<Chrysalis> im learning C
<Reactor> Goodnight, everyone
<Chrysalis> there are no booleans
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, 0 is false
<Chrysalis> no classes
<DIZZYRATCHET> bye reactor
<oni_link> night Reactor
<Phase4> 00,02everything else is 1
<Chrysalis> oh yeah
<Phase4> 00,02i meen true
<Chrysalis> but when bool causes a compile error
<Phase4> 00,02there are bool types in c11 but you dont realy need them
<Chrysalis> it gets incredibly frutrating
<bob> how many kerbals died
<Phase4> 00,02bob, 3
<bob> aw
<Chrysalis> all of them
<Chrysalis> even the children
<cher3ry> yeah, you don't need em tho, just use ints and ==0 means false, !=0 means true
<Phase4> 00,02^
<bob> name one tom hanks
<bob> lol jk
<oni_link> :D
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, there are easy enough work arounds
<Chrysalis> but catching myself is getting rather frustrating
<cher3ry> Yeah, I did similar when I was first working on a Perl project. Bringing C thinking in, wondering why my functions weren't working quite as expected.
<creeperhugger10> well im shell and i made it out of aperature alive.... yeh, im boss
<bob> im bob and i made it out of narnia
<Chrysalis> never used perl
<oni_link> im oni_link and Im made of awesome sauce
<creeperhugger10> yeh, narnia doesnt have companin cubes!!!!
<xxMoopyxx> Tara Stronge and Ashleigh Ball are the best
<bob> : D
<Rain> Im Rain and people like to make puns at my name
<DIZZYRATCHET> moopy back
<Chrysalis> oh dont Rain on their parades
<Phase4> 00,02minmus time
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<oni_link> derp derp derp
<bob> is the stream frozen?
<DIZZYRATCHET> well time for me to go guys
<oni_link> you may be buffering bob
<oni_link> bye DIZZYRATCHET
<DIZZYRATCHET> c you later everypony
<cher3ry> I hate solids at ... wow
<bob> ill justrefresh
<noname> o.o
<Buytoast> oh my
<creeperhugger10> rain rain, is the best, rain rain we cnt contest..... and fail
<xxMoopyxx> later
<Phase4> 00,02not minmus time
<bob> der we go
<Chachamuffin> thips game
<cher3ry> as I was saying, I hate solids at the launchpad... seems like lower atmospheric resistance is so high there's almost no point
<bob> phase if ur every stuck in space just use the houston we have a problem speech lol
<Chachamuffin> dem astronauts
<Alister> yay
<bob> @_@
<oni_link> o.o
<cher3ry> your side rockets are breaking off and hitting the lander..
<creeperhugger10> like a good neighbor, state farm is there
<crazypony> O_O
<cher3ry> need to tie em to the center better.
<Chachamuffin> 6_9
<bob> wow lol
<creeperhugger10> with a new ship
<noname> duct tape everything?
<oni_link> lol
<Chachamuffin> dat OC
<cher3ry> I think it's because the solids are providing _all_ of the thrust in the first stage... the sides aren't powered, so they're just being dragged along.
<Buytoast> stop exploding so loudly, i keep thinking it's one of those puffy bomb mutants trying to blow my ass up
<bob> GET TO DA SPACE SHIIIIIIP
<Rain> I may not be able to make it to Mun, but I can say that I can land on the water tower without any problem, while Phase4 and Sumica can not
<bob> do fuel rods fall off in this game/
<oni_link> Rain: :D an incredible feat
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, thats true
<Phase4> 00,02i think i got there
<creeperhugger10> buytoast, you mean left4dead fat mutants?
<Phase4> 00,02once
<Phase4> 00,02but i exploded afterwards
<Rain> :p
<Phase4> 00,02the water tower that is
<Rain> I think I still have a ship on it
<Phase4> 00,02Much better
<Rain> and it has been there for about 11 game years :D
<Chrysalis> Buytoast you playing dead island?
<Buytoast> no
<Buytoast> The Binding of Issac
<Chrysalis> L4d?
<Chrysalis> ohhh
<bob> a buffer monster is attacking me @_@
<creeperhugger10> oh
<Phase4> 00,02ok, i broke the staging AGAIN
<oni_link> muuch better
<oni_link> nvm
<creeperhugger10> yehh..., ok, now that makes more sense
<Buytoast> freakin aborted mutant fetus babies with bombs in their heads trying to kamikazee me
<Buytoast> annoying little buggers
<Buytoast> well that looks safe
<bob> lagg
<cher3ry> well, a rocket IS just a long tube with a big boom at one end
<Phase4> 00,02i have to turn stream of for a sec
<oni_link> cher3ry: lol
<Rain> finally I can sleep
<noname> ^
<bob> buffer
<creeperhugger10> rain, you type in yo sleep?
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma turn it back on soon
<oni_link> k
<bob> oh nvm
<Rain> have to be up early to mow 2 yards tomorrow in 100+ deg weather..
<oni_link> Rain: yikes
<bob> that sucks ._.

<creeperhugger10> haha cus, power level..... over 9,000. ha hur lol
<Chachamuffin> lets go pay luna a visit
<MadSurge> This is not my day .__.

<Emil> Wow.
<Phase4> 00,02i've like perfectly matched its orbit
<bob> wow
<Emil> This game seems to complicated for my 13 year old brain.
<bob> thats the most awsome orbit ive ever seen
<Emil> He's orbiting the moon now, right?
<bob> yes hes chasing it
<MadSurge> Emil: you could go and make uncontrollable abominations that explode after two seconds :D
<Emil> MadSurge: I guess.
<Spectrum_Rush|> The Mun, and no he's chasing Minmus
<Emil> Nice orbit.
<Phase4> 00,02these nice orbits are making me look like a much better pilot than i am
<Emil> lol
<Emil> Is it alright to laugh if you crash and burn?
<Emil> ; )
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony :)

<Emil> Whaaaat?
<Emil> Why?
<Atler_Tempest> yeah... it happened like, last year...
<Emil> No budget?
<Atler_Tempest> pretty much
<creeperhugger10> they said that they would no longer send out space shuttles, but i doubt it
<bob> :/
<Spectrum_Rush|> Phase4: just gonna tell ya now if ya land on minmus successfully I'll have another grouping of links completely different then what i've shown ya before :)
<Phase4> 00,02Perfect
<Atler_Tempest> too expensive to keep sending people into space
<Phase4> 00,02i think
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|, : D
<bob> they are doing it secretly @_@
<Emil> DUM DUM DUUUM
<Atler_Tempest> and also... NASA is sometimes called Need Another Seven Astronauts for the times they had... accidents...
<Emil> I have also read a horror story based on the moon.

<Emil> Phase4: Before you land, make sure it's NOT a gas planet!
<OtakuTom> Hmm...I need something to eat...
<Spectrum_Rush|> Emil: its not
<Emil> Right.
<MadSurge> We must deliver more pizza to Luna! :D
<Emil> That's what they all said...
<bob> theres gas planets in this game?
<Chachamuffin> welcome to da moon
<Phase4> 00,02its not a gas planet
<Spectrum_Rush|> MadSurge: Luna is on Mun, somepony else is on Minmus
<Emil> Brb.
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush|: who? XD
<Chachamuffin> prepare for extermination
<Emil> There's a bird on our house.
<Spectrum_Rush|> MadSurge: and you'll see if phase make it

<cher3ry> Clearly it's where Luna banishes Celestia to.
<Emil> An icecream planet?
<cher3ry> Luna's dark, not evil.
<MadSurge> ^
<bob> shes just luna
<Emil> Right.
<bob> she can do what she wants : P
<Emil> She doesn't have as much experience with banning people, right?
<Emil> *banishing

<Spectrum_Rush|> MadSurge: told ya
<cher3ry> of all ponies, why does Chrysalis remind me most of my exes?
<Emil> LOL
<oni_link> Phase4: this time, its ice. Nuff said :D
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Good morning everybrony :)
<Emil> Good morning!
<killerpony7733> MaxTheSwedishBrony: Mornin
<oni_link> morining MaxTheSwedishBrony
<Chachamuffin> when she appears she is much more dark then she really is
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush|: I wonder if they'll make a Desktop Pony version of Chrysalis and Discord
<Emil> Dat steam sounds.
<Emil> *sound
<Liokin> Phase4: Well guys we made it to the moon! Now what?.......*turns on My little pony*
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Totally agree on this
<Emil> MaxTheSwedishBrony: What's the clokc at you?
<Spectrum_Rush|> MadSurge: we can only wait, or do it our selfs :D
<Atler_Tempest> take off the helmet....
<killerpony7733> Liokin: Hiya man /)
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> 12 am
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Or Pm
<Emil> Same here.
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush|: aye :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> GASP, you can control Kerbals?????
<Emil> Just checking.
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> :)
<Mare_Major> Phase4: so are we here to collect Rarity? because this planet looks like a Marshmellow menace :P
<MadSurge> KERBAAAAAL
<Liokin> killerpony7733: Sup bro /)
<Emil> JETPACK!
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if this kerbal could make it to orbit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: xD
<OtakuTom> haha
<killerpony7733> Liokin: Had a good day?
<bob> i suspect derpy is here -.-
<Emil> Phase4: You evil, evil, person.
<Emil> Take off the helmet!
<Emil> :D
<Chachamuffin> lol
<Liokin> killerpony7733: Meh.
<killerpony7733> Emil: Just see sumica he kills kerbals left and right at a whimm
<Emil> killerpony7733: Oh.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Phase4: since it seems theres no fuel for kerbal jet packets you could probably make it bak to Kerban
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|, no, theres fuel
<Spectrum_Rush|> oh
<bob> but it would take a year
<killerpony7733> Liokin: Aw well atleast ya got friends on bronystate :)
<Phase4> 00,02but that would be awesome
<Phase4> 00,02to go back to kerbin on nothing but jetpack fuel
<cher3ry> and then SPLAT
<Emil> Like a BAWS!
<Liokin> killerpony7733: True dat.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma go into minmus orbit then i have idea
<Emil> Phase4: Put the astronauts on a MLP marathon, untill they die of loss of oxygen.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02i love the 115 day mission time
<Phase4> 00,02because i was lazy with minmus intercept
<Emil> They get to die happy, atleast.
<Atler_Tempest> i find the lack of crashing disturbing...
<cher3ry> minmus intercept it's easier to apo out to Minmus altitude, then adjust eccentricity, then orbit facing 270 until Minmus speed is matched - puts you on collission course.
<Emil> What kind of takeoff is that?
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> What is this game?
<Emil> Kerbal Space Program.
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder if i could....
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> ah
<Emil> Imagine being in orbit over your target planet/moon, and accidently misclicking, launching all your takeoff fuel off into space.
<Emil> And then being like: "........"
<Emil> "Well... Shit."
<Phase4> 00,02so i could get home super easy
<CCCP> hi :/
<Phase4> 00,02ohai CCCP
<Emil> Hi.
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Heya CCCP :D
<Phase4> 00,02or i could try this

<cher3ry> yes you can
<cher3ry> and, dat landing zone... nice
<MaxTheBrony> Did you guys see the japanese rocket yesterday?
<cher3ry> although drag will probably pull you back to land.
<bob> coming in hot
<phase4fanboy> thats bbetter
<Phase4> 00,02ok, not that precice
<Phase4> 00,02but
<Phase4> 00,02thats where i took off
<bob> bufffer
<Phase4> 00,02from over there
<cher3ry> still practically walking distance. Or swimming. Not sure yet, looks like water
<phase4fanboy> i am the new creeperhugger10!!!
<Phase4> 00,02nere where the pink is
<phase4fanboy> chnged my name
<AdamTheDuck> lol phase4fanboy
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Phase4> 00,02aparently the sas module cant handle parachute
<Phase4> 00,02now we know
<bob> now we know : D
<MaxTheBrony> Oh my
<Phase4> 00,02but other than that
<MaxTheBrony> did you die?
<Phase4> 00,02i call it a success
<cher3ry> but on the positive side, your SAS module is safe!
<Phase4> 00,02MaxTheBrony, i did a bit
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, nope
<phase4fanboy> :) :D
<Phase4> 00,02parachute detatched from it too
<cher3ry> aww.
<cher3ry> what a waste.
<bob> that was perfect space adventure
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02nvm
*cher3ry plays taps for the poor SAS module
<Phase4> 00,02id didnt
<Phase4> 00,02sas module is safe
<cher3ry> yay!
<Liokin> Well the pod will probably sink pretty fast so yeah there goners -lol
<phase4fanboy> YAY PHASE4 !!!!!!
<MaxTheBrony> Noes D:
<Phase4> 00,02but other than that minor malfunction
<Phase4> 00,02i made it to minmus
<Phase4> 00,02landed
<bob> the sas module knocked him off and stole the parachute
<Phase4> 00,02then to the mun
<Phase4> 00,02landed
<Phase4> 00,02then to kerbit
<Phase4> 00,02kerbin';
<cher3ry> no, the pod smashed down at a speed too high - hitting water and hitting rock are the same effective thing, at a sufficiently high speed.
<Phase4> 00,02:D
<cher3ry> discintegrated on impact
*Phase4 00,02feels baws
<bob> if only he had kerbin flags
<phase4fanboy> phase4 is baws!!!!!
<cher3ry> you know those are probably coming as mods now that you have EVA. That, and a variety of kerbonaut chutes and gliders.
<bob> any thing new for planes?
<XAX_> It's not that I was too scared to continue in SCP. I just didn't know what to do...
<Phase4> 00,02one small step for Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02one giant leap for kerbal kind
<creeperhugger10> im back to normal
<bob> anything new for planes @_@
<XAX_> God you type fast Phase4
<creeperhugger10> !!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!
<MaxTheBrony> Phew
<Phase4> 00,02the next chalenge will be when they make another planet
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> one giant leap into a backplant Phase4
<bob> thats a big rocket
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Time to sleep, Goodnight/day everyone
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how to fix sas problem
<creeperhugger10> is it really 6:37, wow
<Phase4> 00,02i kinda need it for landing
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> nite TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<cher3ry> Dunno that you can... that module's big and the SAS module is tiny...
<cher3ry> can you mount the chutes to the side of the capsule instead?
<creeperhugger10> ok, so phase 4 is brodcsting from east coast usa!!!!
<bob> yay
<MaxTheBrony> :O did you build the rocket yourself O.o i didnt know that!
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i could
<Phase4> 00,02MaxTheBrony, i built the rocket myself
<MaxTheBrony> Amazing :O
<bob> i would like to walk around this rocket
<bob> see how big it is
<cher3ry> only other solution that comes to mind is lots of duct tape
<creeperhugger10> what othe video games do youmplay phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02creeperhugger10, a few others
<MadSurge> creeperhugger10: like the new Deus Ex
<cher3ry> or borrow from the wide lander, and put the SAS on the side pods.
<creeperhugger10> ahh, i see. phase, think you should scrap the hole think and try it with a tiny crappy ship!
<creeperhugger10> phase4
<Phase4> 00,02creeperhugger10
<MadSurge> :O they animated tiny kerbals in the hangar!!!
<cher3ry> although your side pods are for thrust rather than landing stability in this design, that shouldn't make a difference as far as SAS goes, as long as they're still attached at landing time
<creeperhugger10> how boat that, try it with the crappiest ship and see how you do
<MadSurge> creeperhugger10: that's Sumica's job :D
<creeperhugger10> :D
<killerpony7733> ^Pretty much
<creeperhugger10> R rated streaming for the win!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: 's designs arent crappy :D theyre just not pretty

<WindWhistler> There were rumors about a new MLP series...it was a sequel to the current one...
<Thrackerzod> Hello
<FairysHuff> WindWhistler if it didn't involve shemale ponies we don't want to know ^_^
<d3rb> g'day Thrackerzod
<WindWhistler> And the new mane six were just filly versions...
<ingwaz> Cypresswolf: where are you finding things like the derpy hooves toy and the box of cards for 50$ with free shipping?
<WindWhistler> Oh, and a filly alicorn.
<WindWhistler> I didn't get it either.
<RaveBrony> d3rb: Yep :D
<WindWhistler> For some reason, I had something against the filly alicorn.
<WindWhistler> She just bugged me.
<Cypresswolf> ingwaz: Amazon - took me 4 days to find - 9 left last I checked - price has risen $5 since yesterday though
<WindWhistler> Luckily it was just a dream.
<ingwaz> ahh Thrackerzod, nice to have a normal pony around
<Thrackerzod> Why is that windwhistler
<WindWhistler> Thrackerzod: I have no idea. I barely remember much about the dream.
<d3rb> so many derpys on ebay, so annoying
<Thrackerzod> ingwaz, i am i regualr magical unicorn
<WindWhistler> d3rb: How much are they going for?"

<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Ponies47: also i remember from biology that a healthy sleep doesnt involve dreams
*WindWhistler is bugged by Thrackerzod's spelling.
<WindWhistler> twily_sprinkle_GS17: That is not true. Dreaming is where your body goes to work.
<Ponies47> brb

<WindWhistler> But RaveBrony, ponyt is never said in MLP.
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> alexxm: well on some live streams they dont start until you wait 30 secs and close the adblock. if you have adblock then it glitches the ad and theres just an outer line of where the ad wouldve been and you cant start up the stream
<Wrek> 05just imagine pony and razer stickers on it

<Quick_Thinker> seriously no one wants to do a Minecraft lets play on PC with the personality of the mane 6
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Quick_Thinker: maybe later, idk. that takes some mental preparation
<Quick_Thinker> point taken
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/fsN-F
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> RP is exhausting for me

<twily_sprinkle_GS17> im at level 16 and i still have 24 damage swordcs
<Dovah> "Loading downloadable content. Please wait" -_-
<Spectrum_Rush|Dov> CCCP: :'(
<CCCP> Spectrum_Rush|Dov: :( awww sorry i still like Luna!
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: people just feel like the show needs more eps with her because shes an interesting character
<HerpDerp> Ooooh, Skywim :3
<CCCP> twily_sprinkle_GS17 i know, and i agree that she does
<alexxm> so what quest is this
<Spectrum_Rush|Dov> god my kingdom for ebony ore right now
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: yeah,shes actually a somewhat relatively complex character
<Bronysith> does anyone else hate regenerating health?
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> man the items he gets. maybe i should play at novice
<Spectrum_Rush|Dov> Bronysith: only on enemies
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|Dov: ...
<Bronysith> well i hate both ways
<Barbetos|Atwork> Huh. I did not know you could do that with torches.
<robotdragon8> i almost went to the womens restroom, luckily no one saw me run out to the men's *phew*
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: if you really want to play hardcore i recommend you set skyrim on the hardest 5th difficulty, i cant imagine it being easy after that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Regenerating health doesn't bother me.
<Spectrum_Rush|Dov> Bronysith: unless i'm in the mood for challenge then no regen on me is fine
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|Dov: i like health pack systems
<Barbetos|Atwork> ouch
<HerpDerp> xD
<robotdragon8> *no one saw me run out of the womens restroom and quickly go into the men's
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush|Dov: regen heatlht reminds me of call of duty
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> weird, he died so fast for that level
<alexxm> i'm not really bothered by regeneting health
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> nobody is :3
<Barbetos|Atwork> Wow. Strong undead guy
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith just likes hardcore gaming
<Spectrum_Rush|Dov> Bronysith: i prefer a game with no health, one hit you ded :3

<Sumica> 00,10must be the good shit to give speed blur
<Quick_Thinker> just saying if you wish to RP your gonna need a decent mic for skype and i also need someone to record and maybe even upload it to youtube
<Bronysith> Wrek: how was it?
<robotdragon8> my character doesnt like mead, he drinks WINE
<Flyboy> Quick_Thinker: ah crap, my last mic broke :(
<ponibas> it was laced...
<Flyboy> could i just speak through the game chat?
<Cypresswolf> :) Double Feature! Ice Age & Batman
<robotdragon8> odd mix
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: the 4th ice age?
<Cypresswolf> yep
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> i still cant believe there are 4 ice ages
<robotdragon8> ice age 5 HUMANITY
<CrimsonPhoenix> twily_sprinkle_GS17, it's Dreamworks
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Pixar ftw
<CrimsonPhoenix> if it works, milk it
<Cypresswolf> I still haven't seen IA3
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> CrimsonPhoenix: thats why i dont like dreamworks
<Quick_Thinker> through the game chat? hmmmmm well not really im using a mic to add some emotion to the words like i already have one thing set up and that is twi going batshit insane at one part
<robotdragon8> me neither Cypresswolf
<CrimsonPhoenix> I agree with you twily_sprinkle_GS17
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean their animation is great and the jokes are ok I guess
<CrimsonPhoenix> but there's no story in their movies
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> ^
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Hobbit is 5 months away
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> Pixar makes the best stories
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why Pixar is superior
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> and so much feels
<Flyboy> Quick_Thinker: : wait, whats your skype name?
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> aw poor wabbit
<CrimsonPhoenix> not only are their jokes subtle and clever, and their animation is glorious
<Cypresswolf> We've made it past the half way mark, ponies ^_^
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> and they have a billions different subtle themes
<robotdragon8> i wish someone would play "strength of a thousand men" by two steps from hell when they fight a dragon
<CrimsonPhoenix> but they can also tell a good story with all of that
<Quick_Thinker> my skype name is Quick Thinker
<Flyboy> Quick_Thinker: oh right :D
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> i need a smelter
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> weird, i thought that town didnt have a smelter
<robotdragon8> snowy areas at night in skyrim make me sad cause its so depressing.

<twily_sprinkle_GS17> robotdragon8: ikr

<Dermathil> I bought the Alan Wake collection in the steam sale!
<Jim> awesome Dermathil
<Jim> sounds liek a fun game
<Dermathil> I'm in love with that series
<Dermathil> thanks to the best LPer ever doing a let's play of it
<Jim> Hannah?
<Dermathil> (he plays smart)
<Dermathil> no
<Dermathil> Galm
<Dermathil> He's so funny yet he voices his thought pattern when he's puzzling
<Jim> I've watched a few LP of it, seems like good storytelling
<Dermathil> GREAT storytelling
<Quick_Thinker> ah Q is back to being an original name i can kinda of rest peacefully
<Dermathil> hell that guy did a LP of Civ 5
<alexxm> hey Dermathil how've you been
<Dermathil> I'm great
<Dermathil> about to leave for a big family reunion.
<Dermathil> At the family lakeside terrain
<Dermathil> (the extended family on my dad's side owns a whole peninsula of land at a small lake
<Jim> Large family reunion? That's something I'll never experience
<Jim> I have no clue what my roots are
<Dermathil> my dad's got 9 sisters and 2 brothers
<Jim> oh wow
<Dermathil> Add to that the cousins and the family that comes from my grandmother's siblings and we are usually 30+
<Dermathil> Fireworks and grilled marshmallows are usually planned<
<Dermathil> after the big family supper
<Jim> I remember like 10 years ago, was in a confirmation for some cousin or something. My exact thoughts: "Who the hell are all these people?"
<Quick_Thinker> sounds like a pinkie swell party
<Dermathil> This time we're celebrating the July anniversaries and my parents' 20 years of marriage
<Dermathil> (there are smaller reunions every month to celebrate the birthdays of that month)
<Jim> sounds swell
<Dermathil> indeed it is
<Dermathil> Back in June was the lobster party
<Jim> you have a lobster party?
<Dermathil> (June birthdays and lobster)
<Jim> Ohh man
<Dermathil> yeah
<Jim> you guys are awesome
<Dermathil> IKR
<Saturn> 08,01something wicked this way trots
<Dermathil> hey Saturn

*AttacktheAndalite shivers at Saturn "Go on...."
<Dermathil> happy Cake Day Thrackerzod
<Quick_Thinker> well happy bithday Trackerzod you old god you
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<AttacktheAndalite> Happy birthday, track
<Jim> hai Malavolent
<AttacktheAndalite> Hey Malavolent
<Thrackerzod> ello Malavolent
<Quick_Thinker> hm howard stern
<MadSurge> Ohai Malavolent!
<Chrysalis> Saturn didnt you make a room for that kind of talk
<Quick_Thinker> this is risky
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i did
<MadSurge> Saturn: OH U :D
<Quick_Thinker> and already after the first 20 sec i have facepalmed to the luna
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: though it's mainly for the discussion of sex and sexuality
<Saturn> 08,01which sounds like a racier version of a Jane Austin novel
<MadSurge> Saturn: did you read Jane Austen?
<Quick_Thinker> uhhhhhh i feel more creeped out by these guys talking about ponys being sexual more then clop fics and other things
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: of course
<Dermathil> Shame I can't stay at the peninsula for longer than the party
<Dermathil> Otherwise I'd go hiking up the ski resort (that's closed in summer because NO SNOW)
<Saturn> 08,01Quick_Thinker: we don't tend to talk about that
<Saturn> 08,01we talk about real things; albiet real things that would get one banned in here
<MadSurge> Saturn: sounds like a woman whose works I would like to read :)
<Lil_B> Quick_Thinkerme too, I can understand Clupfics or Pictures that are done for the Lulz, but people that generally think that these are sexy are creepy :/
<Saturn> 08,01read some heinlein
<MadSurge> We tend to say "X is best pony", but that's about it :D
<Dermathil> LOL In my twitter feed: "I only bring up Slender 'cos people keep mailing me about it. Slenderman is filed alongside MLP under 'things the Internet is weird about' "
<Jim> Q is best pony
<Dermathil> That's Yahtzee saying that
<Saturn> 08,01slendermane
<Jim> Slendermare
<Dermathil> Slender's an indie game
<Lil_B> I liek Donimusic.. just named his newest Remix "One More Time (Doni's Dubstep/Electro Remix - God Particle Edition)" and has nothing to do with Higgs Bosons
<Dermathil> you gotta get 8 pages before you get caught by Slender
<Jim> Saw someone posting this with the title: "How I play Slender" http://i.imgur.com/haexG.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is Slender?
<Dermathil> an indie game
<Jim> A creepy game
<Dermathil> don't look behind you
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I saw JessieCox play it on a video
<SpadeMagnes[R]> All I know of it..
<Dermathil> you gotta get 8 pages
<Quick_Thinker> i play slender while listen to giggle at the ghosties XD
<Lil_B> I actually saw a Slenderman Pony some month ago, it looked cool
<Dermathil> before you get caught
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dermathil: And let me guess jump scares
<Dermathil> Quick_Thinker: don't. The warning cues are audio.
<Quick_Thinker> and when i see him i laugh
<Dermathil> you'll only drown out the only warning that are telling you you're about to die
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Maybe Slender just wants friends
<Quick_Thinker> eh like i care its all for fun
<Dermathil> the papers say otherwise
<Quick_Thinker> i would go up to him and give a nice big hug if he didnt instakill me as soon as i tried
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well I don't intend to play it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Slender is just misunderstood
<alexxm> well given that everyone who meets the slender man goes insane or ends up dead i don't think so
<Lil_B> what did I wanted to do again :/ I forgot?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where the hell did the whole Slender myth originate from?
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Eat?
<Lil_B> Saturn you wanted to give me some feedback on my song, I currently have time (I always have time XD )
<Jim> SpadeMagnes[R], It was a photoshop contest.
<Lil_B> Malavolent no, I was searching something, but eating would be a good Idea
<CCCP> trolljhg
<Malavolent> Lil_B: I know, right?
<Lil_B> Malavolent I'm afk getting somer bread XD
<Malavolent> Yay.
<Dermathil> O_O Guys ArmA 2 is 40% off on the daily deal
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it sad I consider all of you my only friends? Aside from my WoW guildies
<Jim> Someone on Something Aweful posted a contest, where you had to photoshop normal pictures to look supernatural and pose them on this supernatural webpage as true stories
<Jim> Dermathil, Got it before the sales :P
<Dermathil> Jim: kick yourself
<Jim> I am
<Dermathil> NEVER buy a game before it goes on the daily deal
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/6NXnxTNIWkc
<Malavolent> SpadeMagnes[R]: Meet new people.
<Lil_B> wait, I remembered, I want to search fo"First Samurai" on Youtube XD gotta do that before I forget it again
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Malavolent: If I had a car or a life I would...
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's always good to know some roots I say
<Malavolent> SpadeMagnes[R]: You were born with legs, use them, take a walk, visit places and stuff.
<Dermathil> ...dafuq why did I get a steam popup saying "LAST-CHANCE TO PRE-ORDER Prototype 2"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm really pale because I dont go outside, so my mom tells me
<Dermathil> You need a tan then
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], welcome to my world
<Malavolent> Why should being pale stop you from meeting people?
<Quick_Thinker> i go outside sometimes and i look like i have a nice tan
<Gaston> same
<Quick_Thinker> keyword is sometimes
<Gaston> no one tans like gaston
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No one gastons like gaston
<Quick_Thinker> no one also gets killed like Gaston
<Gaston> gastonception
<AttacktheAndalite> One does not simply do X like Gaston
<Gaston> exactly
<Quick_Thinker> Gaston killed by whateve the beast name is
<Gaston> beast
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Now that I think about it, my neighborhood barely has any kids.
<Jim> dammit internet connection
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Man I have been playing Kingdom Hearts Re: Coded for days....
<pony_7262> vd
<CrimsonPhoenix> welp today I just got another conclusion
<pony22473> who's streaming?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CrimsonPhoenix: Of?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/32FB-gYr49Y this version is 1000 times better than what the streamers use
<pony22473> but who's streaming?
<CrimsonPhoenix> huh noone?
<Jim> Dermathil, seems like I wouldn't have anything to gain from the arma deal anyways http://i.imgur.com/MWL9g.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I can not believe some one made another I wanna be the guy game..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The first one was sadistic enough
<Dermathil> LOL
<Unnr> Jim, ARMA deal?
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], there's like 5 games
<CrimsonPhoenix> if not more
<Quick_Thinker> they made another FUCK now i have to beat that one
<Wrek> 05ping saturn
<Jim> He says so
<sergio_scriptor> hello everypony :) how is everyone doing ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The one I just learned about is I wanna be the guy gaiden
<Jim> 40% off if I'm correct
<Quick_Thinker> hey sergio
<Unnr> Jim :O!
<Quick_Thinker> 20% off actually
<Quick_Thinker> probely gonna go to 50 or 75 on the final day
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean the even the game's map screen can kill you!
<sergio_scriptor> may i ask waht are you guys talking about ? :P
<sergio_scriptor> *what
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah, those games aren't very fun :|
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still find it amazing some insane man managed to beat I wanna be the guy on impossible mode
<Unnr> SpadeMagnes[R]: There is an IWTBTG : TM : TG The Sequel?!?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When he found out the creator said and I quote "Holy crap you're not serious are you"
<MadSurge> Unnr: fanmade.
<Unnr> MadSurge: Ooooh, that makes much, much more sense
<Unnr> I love how the impossible mode has a glitch that allows you to save
<MadSurge> ^
<Quick_Thinker> waht?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You mean that moving save point?
<Unnr> Yep
<Unnr> there is exactly one frame that before it tries to eat you, its a valid save point
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also how insane do you have to be to try that game with out dieing?
<Unnr> I got to dracula on Insane
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Apples do not fall up
<SpadeMagnes[R]> "They're more like giant cherries"
<Unnr> SpadeMagnes[R]: of course, that's why its delicious fruit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I doubt anyone could beat the game without dieing on their first try
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Alot of the stuff that kills you comes out of fucking nowhere

<Unnr> sergio_scriptor: yep
<Quick_Thinker> well spade if someone can beat throught the fire and flames on expert with no mess ups anything possible
<sergio_scriptor> Unnr: can you send me a link ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<SpadeMagnes[R]> sergio_scriptor: When the make found out he said "Holy crap you're not serious are you"
<Buytoast> ah bullocks i left this on all night
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: my greatest respects for the guy or girl who did it
<Quick_Thinker> they are probely in a mental ward
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> sergio_scriptor: It took the guy 6 days on nonstop trying
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *of
<Quick_Thinker> so he never even sleept damn
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No he said he took breaks
<Dken2021> lali-ho bretherin and... sisterin
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He did take breaks for sleeping and eating
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: well i guess you can say that we *puts on sunglasses* wasted a life.YEEEEEEEEAHHHH...sorry that was not my best one :$
<sergio_scriptor> *he
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Said it cost him his sanity and probably his soul
<Dken2021> hai ish, finished with that math thing?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Gah damn it, gotta avoid the Eliminator again...
<Quick_Thinker> ok now ARMA is 40% off
<SpadeMagnes[R]> freaking heartless....
<Quick_Thinker> too bad i already bought it when it came out
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: i think you mean "dayz" is 40 % off...
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/B0eo5
<Quick_Thinker> ahahhahahahaa
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CrimsonPhoenix: The fuck?
<Quick_Thinker> i play ACE as well and some of the flashpoint maps
<Unnr|SlowReponseAhea> sergio_scriptor: ARMAII is a perfectly good game in its own right
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], My planet needs me
<sergio_scriptor> Unnr|SlowReponseAhea: i know,i was just referencing the fact that almost 80% of the people who buy arma 2 only buy it to play dayz :P
<Quick_Thinker> and im so bucking hyped for ARMAIII
<sergio_scriptor> let's be honest if you had dayz has a stand-alone game,and someone went up to you and said: "i have arma 2 and dayz,you can choose one of them for free,which one do you choose? "which one would You truly choose ?
<Quick_Thinker> arma 2
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh wow this pop up is bugging me
<Quick_Thinker> in every way do i love that game
<Quick_Thinker> it took me hours to learn how to fly a helo and afte that i was flying rainbow dash style
<Quick_Thinker> and i did it all on my own
<Quick_Thinker> but Arma 2 is optimized for crap
<sergio_scriptor> arma 2 is a unique game,truly one of the most realistic experiences,but if i had to choose between a realistic war simulator or a realistic zombie simulator,i would choose the zombie one...sorry :\
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what isnt fun in a game? Doing a level with no weapons and said leve has a bunch of enemies and objects that damage you
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: so "afraid of monsters" in a nutshell ? :)
<Quick_Thinker> waht game may that be?
<Quick_Thinker> oh wait day z thnaks to the ppatchs
<Dken2021> or better yet, leveling up a move by using it like 70 times
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kingdom Heart Re: Coded in the Hollow Bastion section
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont have the keyblade, cant use spells, Cant even heal, and I have to rely on the AI of Goofy and Donald
<Quick_Thinker> sergio you actually want to play day z i stopped play for a long time after o found this site and i feel i need to go back to it
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: i liked dayz more when you atleast with a makarov :'(
<sergio_scriptor> *started
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] you're doomed
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You can order then to either follow you atatck blox or heartless
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The main issue is I cant use Curaga
<Lil_B> good thing I avoided buying Quantum Conundrum before :) now is the time to strike
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have to either use potions or wait for health orbs
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: to be honest i would like to try dayz,even just 1 time
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Suddenly cone
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: it looks fun...sometimes
<nonody2> Am i the only one who is seeing website is offline? D:

<Quick_Thinker> oh giggle at the ghosties metal sounds freaking epic
<alexxm> metal makes everything sound epic
<Jim> War Z sounds interesting, because when you die you don't lose hour upon hour of progress
<Quick_Thinker> and thats why i made that day z MLP FIM crossover fic to show that even they will ahve a tough time being friends there
<Jim> you are only locked out of the character for a set amount of time when you die
<creeperhugger10> i was a player in the TF2 LIVESREAM!!!
