<Shizuka> 13so basically the random number god hates me today
<Shizuka> 13and that still didn't beat my highest scoring shot >>
<Sir_slendy> da fudge
<Sir_slendy> that was amazing
<VenHur> You now swaps FOUR gems at once instead of the usual two.
<magmablock> Open the game with a threefer
<Rustymeat> random number god is kinda of a dick
<Shizuka> 13you see this thing screwing me out of the fruit combos?
<Sir_slendy> ...
<Shizuka> 13jerk RNG...
<cachi01> btw what was the difference between bejeweled 1,2 and 3?
<Sir_slendy> ...
<VenHur> cachi01: They played the same, but new modes are added as the series progessed. Some that are very rare.
<Syn_Virtu> lots of exelents
<cachi01> VenHur: i've played 1 and 2 and imo they are exactly the same lol
<Kimori> oh yeah?
<VenHur> There's a classic mode in Bejewled 2, but you have to highlight the four modes in a circular order.
<Kimori> it looks the same to me..
<zacksters> LEMON GEM EXPLOSION!!!
<VenHur> Classic Mode is like Bejeweled 1, no Hypergem and all that jazz.
<magmablock> Can you twist them counterclockwise?
<Shizuka> 13YAY
<Cades> oh?

<Rustymeat|Pink> oh my
<Kandarihu> The object of the game is to get a piece from all 4 colors home. So rooting for or against a single color is counterproductive.
<sonicdude558> Whos streaming? Sumica?
<Sovietguy|Red> CLEARLY THE DICE HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE CAPITALIST PIG DOGS
<sagas|Cyan> for the glory of cyan!
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, Shizuka

<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Well at least you didn't have to ride a Kerbal rocket to get there. :P
<Phase4> / Allow for a plugin to insert a different class to handle requests.
<Phase4> what the hell wordpress
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: It's interesting. My hubby's still at home because his work called and said "stuff's broken. Come in later"
<alexxm> what does he do Gold_Demona
<Phase4> hale servers (like this one) are good for getting stuff done
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: hubby lol
*AdamTheDuck flips table
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, XD
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit why do I have to keep redownloading all these PF2 models? ;<
<AdamTheDuck> :<*
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: He loads trucks at a milk bottling plant.
<Gold_Demona> Simply put, he puts the milk on the trucks that go to the stores
<TheRandomkid321> I don't like servers with plugins like this. It goes against TF2 lore. How do ponys get into the TF2 world anyway?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, magnets.
<sub06905|TARDIS> magic
<Gold_Demona> fandom
<TheRandomkid321> I knew someone would say magic
<Gold_Demona> And who cares about the lore?
*AdamTheDuck cares about lore
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona... ME
<AdamTheDuck> Just not TF2 lore XD
<Vivix> I love lore, but TF2 is..just an mp game
<Jmo> Want a tissue diddums?
<AdamTheDuck> Run Forrest RUN!~
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix it has a story you know?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, it's about the gameplay, not the lore. The lore is just an added bonus that's off to the side.
<Vivix> I didn't know
<Vivix> but it's just an mp game, it's like how fanfictions can play with canon because fanon can never affect canon
<Vivix> so a mp server with plugins isn't touching the lore or canon
<Gold_Demona> Most people don't even know the game HAS a lore
<Ninjazz> The trailers is pretty much all you need to know.
<TheRandomkid321> If a fanfic goes against lore I stop reading it.
<alexxm> what game are we talking about
<therainbowvortex> whats lore????
<Vivix> That I do too Therandomkid
<Moopy> so after pinkie pie next is pinkamena right?
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: the story
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> Herp
<Vivix> but- I don't know
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, think back story and stuff
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: ohh thought so
<Vivix> but they can do it because they're not official
<AdamTheDuck> Like why Red is fighting Blu.
<Gold_Demona> Applebloom hat! :D
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> AdamTheDuck: because they're ordered to do so.
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> AdamTheDuck: They're mercenaries.
<Gold_Demona> Seriously, TF2 is such that the lore is just off to the side. The game itself is just fun gameplay stuff.
<Gold_Demona> Anything goes
<AdamTheDuck> I know that GriffonCherry|Bmaid, I'm explaining it to therainbowvortex. But also think why Red wants Blue dead as well.
<therainbowvortex> im so bord to day
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> AdamTheDuck: wait a sec, finding a video for explaining that.
<Moopy> therainbowvortex: hey dude
<AdamTheDuck> GriffonCherry|Bmaid, don't worry, I don't need a video. I know why they're fighting.
<therainbowvortex> Moopy: whats up
<Moopy> do you have the internet checkers?
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdvpAGMJss
<Moopy> Hey no send youtube links
<Vivix> StreamisOn?
<therainbowvortex> um i dont think so
<GriffonCherry|Bmaid> for those of you who don't now the lore
<Gold_Demona> that unallowed link
<therainbowvortex> Moopy: i dont think so
<Moopy> check real quick
<Vivix> I don't even know what that is
<therainbowvortex> Moopy: how
<Phase4> 	function addTwoNumbers($args) {
<Phase4> 		$number1 = $args[0];
<Phase4> 		$number2 = $args[1];
<Phase4> 		return $number1 + $number2;
<Phase4> 	}
<Moopy> Go to your start window
<Vivix> that $
<Phase4> to be fair its a test but still
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, ok, that makes sense.

<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, nah, Skype was made for people to spam you :$
<Vivix> Hence why I don't have it-

<Invi|bacomnom> what is that song?

<Buytoast> isn't this from that hidden room in portal 2?
<Phase4> Buytoast, yeah
<Vivix> yeah, noone was actually mean-
<Jmo> Except DWR

<Ninjazz> It's kay.

<DashWithRainbows> Wow, there is plenty of space on the server.

<Vivix> I could tell it was a hawk from the jizz
<Vivix> (not a dirty line)
<DashWithRainbows> >Ninjazz
<DashWithRainbows> His name is Ninrap
<TheRandomkid321> I wish to apoligise for my irrational behaviour a few minutes ago. I have school tomorrow where I am constantly bullied and I was just aggrivated by DashWithRainbows and Jmos comments which were probably jokes in the first place. I also have detention tomorrow because I fought one of the bullies so I a stressed about that aswell.
<Ninjazz> My more well endowed evil sister.
<Ninjazz> AAAAAARRRRGH DWR.

<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, you're on the internet and taking things seriously?
<Vivix> gid <3
<Vivix> most norwegian net slang looks terrible in english
<Vivix> GID ASS
<Jmo> Internet i srs bsns.
<Jmo> is^
<Ninjazz> You can find some serious beans on the internet.
<TheRandomkid321> I'm going to ignore that comment Phase4.
<Ninjazz> Unless you're on medical forum or something.
<Jmo> MAH BEANS.
<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, 6_9
<Jmo> Phase4 has a point.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Like I always say, lighten up TheRandomkid321
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid32: You take a lot of things WAY too seriously.
<Ninjazz> A very pointy point.
<Vivix> When someone tells you to lighten up, they aren't insulting you, so to speak
<TheRandomkid321> GOld_Demona I do take things seriously.
<Jmo> You're not gonna have fun with life in the future if you take everything seriously.
<Ninjazz> It's okay to be sensitive but learn when things aren't serrious.
<Jmo> You need to loosen up and enjoy life.
<Vivix> only things you must take seriously, is responsibilites and your job
<Jmo> ^
<AdamTheDuck_> ^^
<Ninjazz> Job not so much.
<Vivix> Depends on the job
<d3rb> ^
<Ninjazz> Very much so.
<Invi> Vivix, depends on the job. what if you work as a... uh... clown :D
<Vivix> but you can be serious at work, and still throw rubber balls at your coworker
<Gold_Demona> Death and taxes.
<Vivix> Hehe, you have to be SERIOUSLY FUNNY
<TheRandomkid321> It's hard to enjoy life when you know at the end of it you are going to be rotting away in a hole somewhere.
<AnFo> :>
<Vivix> Nah, we're all gonna die, but you have to have fun on the way there
<Jmo> alright I'm not hassling this.
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<AnFo> Night :>
<Invi> nighty NewSuperBronyU|Zzz *huggiewubbie*
<d3rb> goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Dude, that's not something that's worth worrying about.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz ~
<Ninjazz> Nacht SB.
<d3rb> TheRandomkid321, with thast in mind, enjoy life
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: It happens to literally everybody, so what's the point in letting it bother you?
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona I'm going to ignore you calling me a Camels penis.
<AdamTheDuck> # Always look on the bright side of life #
*AdamTheDuck whistles
<Gold_Demona> .....What?
<Jmo> She didn't even acll you that?
<Vivix> Maybe dude means several things?
<Jmo> call*
<Ninjazz> Dat kick btw.
<TheRandomkid321> How did I get kicked?
<d3rb> something about colours
<Vivix> autokick from colour detection
<TheRandomkid321> I never ued colours. AT least not conciously.
<Ninjazz> U used colors without using colors.
<Invi> he did?
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Where in the bloody blue hell did you get "camel's penis" in anything I said?
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona Dude = Camels Penis
<Jmo> ROFL
<Invi> xDDDD
<Vivix> late 19th century (denoting a dandy): probably from German dialect Dude 'fool'
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut .-.
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: Yeah, and a dork is a whale's penis. Yer point?
<Vivix> apparently not
<Ninjazz> I've heard Elephant Ass hair, but that works.
<Vivix> You have to be joking around now, right? We can't take offense to duude
<alexxm> why would you use elephant ass hair
<Vivix> softer than dog fur
<TheRandomkid321> I TRY to be humourous and noone finds it funny. That's why I take things seriously.
<Invi> and better for a wg
<Invi> *wig
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: The joke was really obscure.
<Gold_Demona> And I mean REALLY obscure
<Jmo> ^
<Vivix> yeah- we didn't get it
<Ninjazz> Shrug.
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona Once again why I am serious. NOONE GETS MY BLOODY JOKES!
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: There's a reason one of the rules of comedy is to know your audience
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona speaks TRUUUUUTH.
<d3rb> its one joke, dont stress
<Vivix> [no object] (dude up)
<Vivix> dress up elaborately:
<Vivix> my brother was all duded up in silver and burgundy
<Vivix> I laughed, LOUDLY
<Vivix> In the freaking Oxford Dictionary
<Invi> hehe. my mom would kill me if i would do that
<AdamTheDuck> Duded... up? :D
<Vivix> Sounds so silly
<AdamTheDuck> That just doesn't sound right.
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Vivix> Bro, you duded up yet?
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: There's a difference between being serious and taking things seriously.
<Gold_Demona> Especially TOO seriously
<AdamTheDuck> browniestaet is srs bsns
<Invi> addm pls
<Vivix> RibboneTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> In the great words of Jaymoo
<TheRandomkid321> Not to mention seriousness is a rarity in this day of age. My sister (14) wears pants that are cut SO short you can see the pockets hanging out. THAT'S considered fasion. You go out in a tuxedo and you get laughed at probably.
<Jmo> ^wat
<AdamTheDuck> ^^ lolwut
<Vivix> depends on where you are with said tuxedo
<Vivix> Tuxedo is NOT casual wear though
<Vivix> you'd get laughed at in the 1800th century too
<AdamTheDuck> I love vests and pink bow ties \:3/
<Vivix> wait waht 19th century*
<Ninjazz> 04B07R08O09W11N12I06E13S04T07A08T09E11 12P06L13S04.
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix I would wear a tuxedo daily if I had one.
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz
<Vivix> Ninjazz: WORTH IT!
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Ninjazz
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Invi> Ninjazz, totally worth it ^^
<Ninjazz> WOOOOOOORRTH IT.
<Jmo> Browniestate pls stahp being srs bsns.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Gold_Demona> I hear tuxedo's are incredibly uncomfortable.
<Vivix> depends how good they are
<Invi> AdamTheDuck, I find bow ties , right adjusted, hilarious. have you seen ziny tim? :D
<Invi> *tiny
<Vivix> but they're ... after 18:00 and only formal occations, wearing one elsewhere is "silly peasant" ish
<Jmo> I like bowties. Bowties aer cool.
<Jmo> are^
<Gold_Demona> I know the two times I've seen my husband in a tux, he wasn't comfortable at all.
<Vivix> They ær cool Jmo
<AdamTheDuck> Invi, Tiny Tim... Where have I heard that before?
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: You know what else is cool? Fezes
<Jmo> Oh yeah
<Vivix> Fezes are awesome
<Vivix> Fez, Bowtie and a monocle
<Ninjazz> And the sad thing is that even with the martyr kick, topic is still on srs mode.
<Vivix> you're the man of the hour
<Invi> AdamTheDuck, Living in the sunshine, loving in the moonsgine ^^
<Invi> *sunlight and moonlight
<AdamTheDuck> Invi, yes, I remember now :$
<Invi> can't find the pic, but he had a giant bow tie ^^
<AdamTheDuck> Invi, hehe, I can imagine it :D
<Jmo> I want a fez.
<AdamTheDuck> I got a fedora :P
<Ninjazz> I want a tophat.
<Vivix> You can do carnac
<Ninjazz> All I have is a cabby hat.
<Vivix> I like hats, but I feel uncomfortable wearing them
<Invi> Ninjazz, me too. i just have a straw hat :<
<AdamTheDuck> I'm still looking for a bowler hat though ;~;
<Jmo> A fedora. HAH GAAY
<d3rb> lol
<Vivix> Fedoras are EXPENSIVE
<Ninjazz> Invi, I got two of those. If you own a garden, it's pretty much mondatory.
<d3rb> hipster central here :P
<Gold_Demona> I like Fedoras :<
<Jmo> ikr
<AdamTheDuck> d3rb, :P
<Invi> Ninjazz, I have no garden
<Gold_Demona> <---[Jigen fangirl]
<Ninjazz> Carrot top pls.
<Jmo> But what about Fezes?
<Jmo> ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Fezes are cool
<Invi> a fez?
<Vivix> Fez, floral shirt, chest hair, and tight tight tight shorts, and you're from the 80s scaring girls away from the bar
<d3rb> and phat pants
<Invi> Fezes are funny
<Invi> but I prefer a turban over a fez ^^
<Vivix> Don't the masons wear fezes in their parade?
<Gold_Demona> The Doctor rawks teh fez
<Jmo> ^
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't want a turban. They look complicated.
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> I kinda like hats with feathers in them
<Invi> Gold_Demona, if you may wear one, you have enough money to have personal for that ^^
<Gold_Demona> Invi: This is true
<Gold_Demona> Can hire somebody to wrap your head for you. XD
<Invi> i wonder how much that woulkd cost...
<TheRandomkid321> I think I'll go to bed now. Might as well face the fuckwits at school asap.

*Lil_B hugs AdamTheDuck Invi and Vivix :3
<Malavolent> Ohai Lil_B.
*Ninjazz proceeds to greet Lil_B with a friendly embracement.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, sort of.
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck finally found a name :)
*Lil_B hugs Malavolent as well :)
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, yeah I was afk last time to ask you what it was :$
<AdamTheDuck> Then you left :P
*Lil_B shackes Ninjazz hand like a Sir
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck :P
<AdamTheDuck> Like a sir.~ http://fav.me/d59wade
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck anyway, my name shall be konsolN, I have used this name since for longer than Lil'B and it's the name of my youtube :3
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck and nobody has this name :)
<AdamTheDuck> Konsoln, interesting.
<doughnutjoe> what a coincidence im downloading TF2 right now :)
<Ninjazz> And people will finally stop thinking you're a girl at first glance.
<AdamTheDuck> May I ask if it's German for something? :P
<Invi> Lil_B, you thought he was a girl? :D
<AdamTheDuck> Funny, I Lil_B did sound like girl at fist, but internet logic dictates that everyone is a caucasian male of ages 18 to 30 :$
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck "Konsole" is a console , and "N" because Nintendo xD kind of an anagramm for Nintendo consoles
<AdamTheDuck> I though*
<AdamTheDuck> first*
<doughnutjoe> Silly fillys there are no girls on the internet!
<Ninjazz> Thought**
<Lil_B> ... people thought I was a Girl at first? <.< I didn't even notice
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit, typo in my typo correction >.>
*Ninjazz pats AdamTheDuck's back.
<doughnutjoe> Liil_B i always thought you where a guy
<Invi> hehe most people also trhought I was a girl ^^
<Ninjazz> I have no idea why.
<Lil_B> well, noboidy ever askedc me if I was a GFirl or not, nether did anyone used "she" or "her" when reffering to me xD
<Ninjazz> But thankfully, I've only been confused as female ONCE. And I still don't have ANY idea how.
<Gold_Demona> I'm a girl, but I think most of you know that by now. :P
<Jmo> I didn't know that
<Jmo> <.<
<doughnutjoe> Is this like pony survival or something?
<Gold_Demona> I typically assume everybody else in here's a guy unless they identify otherwise
<Ninjazz> You gots a hubby, Gold_Demona.
<doughnutjoe> or like a jugggernaut mode?
<Ninjazz> U must be gurl.
<AdamTheDuck> Nah I thought you were guy Invi :D
<Lil_B> the only Guy who I was confused was Gildash, but he kinda did it on purpose to confuse people xD
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: Not necessarily. Gay marriage is legal in some state. :P
<Gold_Demona> states*
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona I tent to forget that , sry, just my lac of memory :/
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, kidding. I know that.
<Invi> AdamTheDuck, ja ja ^^
<Jmo> HAH. GAAAAAAY
<Gold_Demona> To my awareness, Florida is not one of them tho. :D
<doughnutjoe> Jmo :D
<AdamTheDuck> God, that reminds me of this one image
<doughnutjoe> What are your oppinions on gay marriage bronystate?
<Jmo> It's gay.
<Jmo> :>
<Lil_B> I couldn't care less
<AdamTheDuck> It had this American protest, with a sign that had "Homosexuals are gay"
<Ninjazz> no wai.
<Ninjazz> I had no clue.
<Jmo> I don't mind, as long as they keep to themselves it isn't hurting anyone.
<AdamTheDuck> And I'm thinking, "really man?" :D
<doughnutjoe> Jmo if only most people were like that
<Ninjazz> I don't care so much about it. Live and let live. Or let die.
<Lil_B> do whatever you want, don't hurt anybody, and don't rub it into anyones face, thats what I expect from every Fanbase, Ethnical group, and basicly everyone :/
<Vivix> ^
<Jmo> If you're gonna bash it, then you better have a solid reason.
<Invi> well said Lil_B
<Gold_Demona> ^
<doughnutjoe> "But the bible says it's wrong!!!"
<doughnutjoe> ZOMG
<Vivix> Lets not bash the bible either
<Vivix> do unto others what you want done unto you
<Jmo> Let's just bash Vivix instead.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> Yes, I looove it
<Jmo> WUT.
<Ninjazz> Maaassssochist.
<Invi> yeah, the bible also says, you shouldn't eat for 1 week
<Vivix> hit me HARDER Jmo!
<Gold_Demona> The Bible also says Jesus told everybody not to judge other people and just leave that to God.
<Jmo> WUUUT.
*doughnutjoe bashes Vivix
<Vivix> Gold_Demona, indeed
<Gold_Demona> So even the Christians are doing it wrong!
<doughnutjoe> Gold_Demona exactly
<Vivix> To be critical though; I've met more angry atheists than religious people
<therainbowvortex> i told yall id be back
<Ninjazz> Oh finally. People who aren't bashing the Bible and are quoting. You suprise me every day Browniestate.
<Invi> Jmo, the bible could be actually an awesome action story, but when that jesus guy shows up, it gets boring ^^
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai again therainbowvortex
<Jmo> >.>
<Vivix> hehehe
<AdamTheDuck> Invi, lolwut XD
<Lil_B> people don't understand the Bible >.< tecnicly the old Testament should be removed, because a lot of the Morals in there, were later revised by Jesus
<Vivix> I think the Norwegian church only hands out the new testament
<Vivix> I'm not sure
<Gold_Demona> Invi: To me it got boring right after the Adam and Eve story when it started listing off this endless lineage that comes after Adam. Oh dear GOD, why are these people important?
<doughnutjoe> Invi i know right??? Who would you rather worship some guy with a beard in clouds or a big ass firey kick ass red monster
<Vivix> I've never read it, actually
<Vivix> But it was my favourite class in school
<Invi> Gold_Demona, that are just stories to entertain ^^
<Malavolent> "TF is kill"
<doughnutjoe> LOL
<Malavolent> "no"
<doughnutjoe> Game crashed :D
<therainbowvortex> Ninjazz: i had people bivle bashing me most of my childhood
<Gold_Demona> Listing off a bunch of people just to show how long the lineage is is not good writing imo. =/
<Invi> doughnutjoe, not to forget that that guy in the clods killed humanity at least 1 time ^^
*Jmo sits on Gold_Demond
<Invi> *clouds
<Gold_Demona> Especially when said people listed are NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN
<Gold_Demona> Ow Jmo! y u sit on me? D:

<Jmo> Yo mama.
<Vivix> I can't remember- I saw it on Operation Flashpoint years and years ago
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, oh you
<Jmo> Ahaha how long it has been since I've said that.
<AdamTheDuck> Google is mah friend~
<Vivix> Jmo..Jmo
<Vivix> Jmo..
<Vivix> JMO
<Vivix> Mordi
<Jmo> Keep going.
<Jmo> :>
*Vivix laughs loudly
<Phase4> i have ideas
<Phase4> bad ideas that should never be implimented
<Phase4> so par for the course
<AdamTheDuck> Ah that's right, Einstein
<Vivix> Mordi is trondheim version of Yo mama
<Vivix> Einstein, really? Nice
<Vivix> What ideas are those?
<AdamTheDuck> " I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but world War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
<AdamTheDuck> ^ That made me think for days :$
<Jmo> Oh the things you reblog Dema.
<Phase4> coLinux uses svn
<Phase4> what is this i dont even
<Fersure> people still use svn?
<Phase4> (for those who dont get it, linux development is primaraly done in git because svn sucks)
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> github
<Phase4> (git and svn are file versioning tools, so we can track changes easily)
<Fersure> Phase4: see previous question
<Vivix> SVN is popular in Gmod, that's about it
<Phase4> svn should stop existing
<Vivix> well- with gmod13 they wont use that for autoupdate anymore
<Jmo> Make someone RQ DWR
<Fersure> I love github
<Phase4> its overcomplicated and less powerfull than git
*Phase4 wub git
<DashWithRainbows> Nah
<Vivix> I've never tried GIT, but I've never done a project with other people either
<Jmo> Screw you den chav
<DashWithRainbows> :P
<Vivix> And I don't use JS libraries or anything-
<Jmo> I wanted to play with you, but fine then ;_;
<Fersure> it makes it so easy for people to look at your software and what you're doing with it
<Fersure> and it encourages open source
<Lil_B> To to make PRogress!
<Vivix> Github is nice
<Fersure> (you can have as many public repos as you like, but you have to pay for private ones)
<Lil_B> >retrocityrampage.exe
<MadSurge> Yo Ninjazz, I found your ideal show :D http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/693cd8e763bbfc4dcdb6ba4d69fc9894.png
<Vivix> but Sourceforge- how are they doing?
<Vivix> When I'm done witih my draw room thing, I want it free for everyone somewhere- and github seems more like a in dev thing than sourceforge-
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, there is only the master race. ALSO, I DREAM. I DREAM OF THAT SHOW.
<Vivix> And I don't want a website of my own, since I will probably never do another project
<Fersure> I have my own website
<Fersure> but github is just easier
<Ninjazz> Ohahaha. There's a blue hat on the AjRarity.
<Gold_Demona> You've got mail. :D
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: No cupcakes, Rarity only, Carousel Boutique!
<Vivix> is it good for doing what sourceforge did though? Offering dl to people who aren't there to code?
<Fersure> sure
<Fersure> inspircd hosts all their stuff on github
<Jmo> wow wtb slot.
<Fersure> http://inspircd.github.com
<Vivix> Ah nice, hm
<Vivix> 'cause yeah, that would probably be ideal then-
<Phase4> sourceforge seems like svn
<Vivix> I just want a simple site that shows a changelog, and source dl for peopel to put on their size
<Fersure> sourceforge uses svn, yes
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Even a Library all about fashion.
<Vivix> people*
<Vivix> and site
<Vivix> jeez, spelling
<Fersure> Vivix: you can put that in your repo readme
<Phase4> Fersure, i meen they conceptually feel like svn
<Vivix> Yeah, but something like inspircd site looks good
<Fersure> "Download the latest version here: <direct link to latest version>"
<Phase4> not all that powerfull and overcomplicates what it does
<Fersure> Inspircd's site is more complex
<Fersure> which suits their needs
<Vivix> yeah-
<Fersure> but you can do it simply too
<Phase4> Fersure, half the time i find those pointing to source files instead of binarys
<Vivix> Yeah, I was wondering since I'd only seen the github sites for eh node and faye
<Fersure> Phase4: yeah
<Jmo> Neeerds
*Vivix puts on huge glasses
<Phase4> Jmo pls
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, we're all nerds here :P
<Fersure> I have three projects on github
<Jmo> It isn't obvious enough.
<Vivix> I'm new to --coding something properly for once, but I'm having fun, and can actually see the finish line
<AdamTheDuck> Here on browniestaet
<Fersure> one is ignored completely but the other two are developed
<Vivix> ah?
*pot80 searches github on google
<Fersure> Vivix: what do you use?
<Fersure> *nix or windows?
<MadSurge> TIME FOR Phase4! :D
<Vivix> windows, it's a pretty basic JS and Html5 eh..application (not sure what to call it)
<Fersure> ah
<Fersure> web app?
<Vivix> If you've ever used paintchat, and groaned at Java plugin and bugs all over, then basically I'm trying to make a noplugin version of that
<Fersure> sounds interesting
<Jmo> Finally
<Vivix> yeah, for people to just have on their site
<Jmo> God damn.
<Fersure> what do you use editor wise?
<Vivix> NPP
<Fersure> back in my windows days I always used note-
<Fersure> yeah
<Fersure> I use vim now.
<Fersure> xD
<Vivix> Aah, I've only ever really used NPP
<Fersure> vim is sexy.
<Vivix> ebcause, I rarely code, so whenever I do- I relearn
<Fersure> you can run it on windows I guess
<Fersure> using cygwin or something
<Vivix> I've never tried it myself-
*Vivix googles
<Vivix> hm- the only thing I miss in NPP are things like- looking up function definition with rigth click and such
<Fersure> oh well I don't use any graphical version of vim
<pot80> well someones got alotta mail
<Gold_Demona> dat mailbox
<Vivix> Ahh, commandline? (forgot linux name..shell?)
<DashWithRainbows> Just realized you may have heard my voice
<DashWithRainbows> forget what I sound like.
<Vivix> I haven't used linux for so long that most of terms and methods are gone
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Derpy is best background pony :3
<d3rb> i can never forget DashWithRainbows
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, lies, Applejack is best background pony.
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: that's one terible joke and you knoe it :|
<Fersure> Vivix: virtual machines are great for that
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, that's why she needs more episodes :/
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: yep
<d3rb> ^ x10000
<AdamTheDuck> The joke wasn't meant to be cruel
<Vivix> Fersure, yeah, I might start dabbling in it again, but I'm not sure what I would use it for
<Fersure> Vivix: I use it as my main OS
<Vivix> Yeah, I wouldn't mind, but all my software is mostly windows only
<Fersure> really I don't know what I would use windows for these days
<Fersure> lol
<Vivix> Animate, Cubase, sai- etc
<Vivix> I like Linux, but yeah, I don't really have anywhere to have it at the moment
<Vivix> maybe put it on the laptop some day
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, AdamTheDuck, funnily enough, she had the most screen time in S1.
<Fersure> in a virtual machine...
<Fersure> lol
<Vivix> mmaybe- I like having it running on its own
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: let's hope for Season 3 then :)
<Ninjazz> Low hopes.
<Phase4> why coulnt i jump :(*
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hello everypony
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: also, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7ce66a404613faf0582f33aa10528b53.jpg Rarity looks fabulous EVEN IN THAT STYLE!

<Ninjazz> MadSurge, her mane looks goooooooood.
<Ninjazz> And daawww Pinkie.
<pot80> better than any modern art ive seen
*Vivix has been to many a modern art galery
*Vivix has liked a lot of it
<MadSurge> pot80: well, Picasso was a great artist, even if he was a dick.
<Vivix> One of the installations was an ATM, and a scarily realistic baby forgotten next to it
<Vivix> I never liked Picasso-
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: what did he do?
<Vivix> I basically liked 16-1900 and 1990-2012
*pot80 went to tate modern and saw piece of paper stuck to wall valued at £20,000
<Vivix> I never look at the values, they're--crazy
<Vivix> Most moder nart installations aren't made to be bought though
<DoctoDoctorWho> I love moder nart
<Vivix> installation vs paintings
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: he never lent any money to his family, who in turn had to rever him as an absolute genius :|
<DoctoDoctorWho> huh
<pot80> Just saying that I don't like THAT kind of modern art
<MadSurge> pot80: those are terrible, I agree.
<Vivix> yeah
<ShyBetaFemale> afternoon everyone
<Vivix> I did see a bunch of random colour splotches called Untitled 1~5 valued at about 800 dollars each
<d3rb> hello ShyBetaFemale

<ShyBetaFemale> that's gross dude i'm sorry hahaha
<d3rb> 72 hours....

<FlutterMEDIC> Bronysith: nice
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: speaking of exercise, I went back to swimming! It's tiresome but satisfying :$
<Dark92Enigma> ........And it took 8 years to make them serious (insert The Dark Knight) thank you!
<Dark92Enigma> William DA FOE!
<Bronysith> FlutterMEDIC: yup, many family members going out to die for this country, cant say i agree but i appreciate what they do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm running every day. Do about a 1/2 mile before breakfast. I'm running farther each day.
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark92Enigma: the first Batman movie was FUCKING AWESOME anyways
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterMEDIC: of course!
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: but you are doing airforce right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: no wait, you get to be a pilot for an EVA dont you?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And they have fitness requirements.
<Bronysith> DONT LIE TO ME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: No.
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: who lied?
<MadSurge> Well, even pilots must be fit and healthy, right?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: yes, you are so being a pilot for an EVA
<StinkomanFan> SPIDERS
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: oh.....you were talking to Nittany_Discord
<StinkomanFan> PUNCH 'EM
<Dark92Enigma> SPiiiiiiideeeeeeerssssssss
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EVA pilot have to be kids with emotional problems.
<HavokOC> hai Nitanny
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: what are the requirements for the Air Force PRT (Physical Readiness Test, if it's called something different for Air Force)
<FlutterMEDIC> all soldiers, regardless of branch, must be physically fit
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: and you are neither of them :D
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: then that means you get to pilot a Gunman
<Shizuka> 1314 with emotional issues?
<Shizuka> 13i missed out :<
<Bronysith> wasnt Asuka like 16 in the anime?
<Bronysith> idk, the way she went was disturbing
<StinkomanFan> BULLSHIT
<StinkomanFan> >One's missing
<StinkomanFan> >Nopony gives a toss
<Rex_Mundi> that teacher is so sinister
<FlutterMEDIC> >don't give two shits about it
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Yeah, that part was pretty nasty
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: but then she comes back to life and escapes the sea of Tang
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: i had them......
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01According to the OTS website, for my age, 39in waist, 33 push-ups, 42 sit-ups, and I have to do a 1.5-mile run in 13:36.
<Bronysith> i mean LCL fluid
<NullRadix> Tour leader has to remain calm and report it later, not freak out in front of the guests
<StinkomanFan> IRL this would just be like Madagascar
<alexxm> why does nobody care one of the experimental spiders is missing
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Mmm tang.
<StinkomanFan> SHUT
<StinkomanFan> DOWN
<StinkomanFan> EVERYTHING
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Everyone turned into tang except Asuka and Shinji.
<FlutterMEDIC> num
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But since I'll probably be 30 before I go, I only need to do 27 push-ups 39 sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run in 14 mins.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, it's not about having emotional problems. They just have to be among the kids who were concieved during the 1st impact.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm the same reason the witch didn't tell dorothy that she could use her slippers to get back home......some people are dicks......
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: no they were tang, but left the sea of tang due to sheer willpower alone
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Wasn't that during instrumentality tho?
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark92Enigma: much like extreme catholics
<HavokOC> what's going on in stream? lawl
<StinkomanFan> Weeeeeeeee
<FlutterMEDIC> HavokOC: first Spiderman movie
<HavokOC> yah, but i hear commentary
<HavokOC> or something

<Dark92Enigma> Oh yeah, i remember William DaFoe was in this one
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: when everyone was turning into delicious tang, that point EVERYONE including shinji and asuka were tang, but left the sea due to their sheer willpower
<StinkomanFan> Why's Lex Luthor there?
<HavokOC> Oh, okay
<Dark92Enigma> HavokOC: Rifftrax AKA MST3K
<Gold_Demona> ah
<NullRadix> Division of Salesmen and Engineers
<FlutterMEDIC> he does look like a puppet
<Dark92Enigma> HavokOC: Mystery Science Theater 3000

*Kurra notes there's a million ways to use your feet in getting in shape, that may be possible een with injury
*Bronysith makes Everlasting_Joy 1 week from retirement
<StinkomanFan> GARGOYLES
<StinkomanFan> WOOOOOOOOOO
<Shizuka> 13oh... and now i know what unforced error means
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: I could use that actually.
<ShyBetaFemale> my right trap muscle was hurting i decided it needed a good stretch and workout
<MadSurge> Shizuka: never watched that movie. Which retcon?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: 1 week in VALVE TIME
<ShyBetaFemale> today was back and biceps day which made me HAPPY
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: :(.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still do my daily runs on my bad foot. It's just dealing with the pain. I think my foot is sore, not broken.
<Shizuka> 13MadSurge: spiderman 3 retcons so that it's sandman that killed uncle ben.. and accidentally
<NullRadix> I need to get back to running... so I can start stressing things again so they can fix themselves
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i suggest advil

<Bronysith> ooho, they are making a MECH?!

<MadSurge> Shizuka: really? :| that's so dumb.
<StinkomanFan> Let's face it, EVERYPONY'S killed Uncle Ben
<Shizuka> 13also "unforced error" is a tennis term, "error in a service or return shot that cannot be attributed to any factor other than poor judgment and execution by the player"

<FlutterMEDIC> KABEEEEM
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<Everlasting_Joy> Who's streaming?

<Dark_Horst> no vid links during strea,s
<FlutterMEDIC> no video links ShyBetaFemale
<Bronysith> Shizuka: and what kind of delicious muffins do you prefer?
<ShyBetaFemale> ohhh
<ShyBetaFemale> ok
<Shizuka> 13raspberry muffins though, i'm all over that
<ShyBetaFemale> sorry
<NullRadix> Bronysith: are brownies on that scale or are they a separate category?
<ShyBetaFemale> i didn't even know you guys were streaming
<Everlasting_Joy> I like cupcakes over muffins.
<Bronysith> NullRadix: brownies have nothing to do with muffins or cupcakes
<Bronysith> Muffins can be eaten for breakfast
<Everlasting_Joy> But cupcakes can be eaten at any time Bronysith.
<naturesfury> ^
<pony_7902> ;)
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: but muffins go better with tea
<Kencolt> Brownies exists in an entirely different space time continuum, and as such are not subject to the causality that muffins and cupcakes are subject to.
<NullRadix> But waffles are the superior breakfast food
<Sylandest> morning, Everlasting_Joy :)
<MadSurge> Never ate a cupcake
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why does he look like he's smiling?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sylandest!
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: But cupcakes can have frosting on them.
<StinkomanFan> I prefer Blueberry muffins
*Sylandest hugs Everlasting_Joy "How are you today?"
<Bronysith> Id rather have pot roast and potatoes for breakfast
<naturesfury> sounds legit
*Everlasting_Joy hugs Sylandest :).
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: not great on emoting properly? :D

<Bronysith> and gravy
<Bronysith> COVER THAT SHIT IN GRAVY
<naturesfury> inject prehaps?

<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, probably.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sylandest: What about you? How are you?
<FlutterMEDIC> SPIDURMAN
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bronysith, pot roast and potatoes? YES.

<Shizuka> 13see if you want to be a superhero, you need to be ultra paranoid BEFORE you get your powers
<Ryunosuke> first ever sonic rainboom
<Shizuka> 13that way it doesn't draw suspicion that no one knows anything about you or your secret identity
<Everlasting_Joy> I want turkey, corn, potatos, pop and all that other good stuff that goes with Thanksgiving.
<Shizuka> 13and on the plus side you can tell your friends and they know not to say anything
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: pop?

<Dark92Enigma> brb
<cachi01> metric system is best system
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Ryunosuke> thats alot of chipmunk voice
<Starflash> So quiet here today, though.
*Gold_Demona is an American who agrees with cachi01
<CriticKitten> Old exposition is best exposition
<SirGanjalf> cachi01: /)
<Gold_Demona> I'm serious, the way we measure things is WAY more confusing. I'm always having to look at conversion charts for everything. >_>
<StinkomanFan> I wonder what Captain Germany would be like
<cachi01> SirGanjalf: (\
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back again.........anypony noticed the dialogue in this movie is cheesy?
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark92Enigma: yep
<cachi01> StinkomanFan: http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/193036-90868-hauptmann-deutschlan_super.jpg
<SirGanjalf> Dark92Enigma: Nah, seems pretty natural for me<_<
<Dark92Enigma> Oh, noes......we have to save her for the SECOND TIME!
<CriticKitten> Aaaaaaand minor plothole: wouldn't that conversation be recorded on the answering machine, thus she could figure out who he is just by listening to it?
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma was it meant to be cheesy
<NullRadix> imperial system isn't excessively crazy. most of our units can be divided evenly by 2, 3, AND 4
<Obsidian> Dark92Enigma: What gave you that impresion :P
<FlutterMEDIC> cachi01: OH YESH
<StinkomanFan> HOLY SHIT, CAPTAIN GERMANY LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER
<CriticKitten> Explodium strikes again
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Obsidian since it's based on the comic..........
<CriticKitten> Good god, it's STILL exploding?
<Obsidian> Dark92Enigma: I know I was just being sarcastic
*Dark92Enigma Do you accept my offer? Are You In or Out?
<StinkomanFan> This scene is what Micheal Bay watches behind closed doors
<cachi01> StinkomanFan: oh look it even has its own toy! http://www.figurerealm.com/userimages/customs/3500/3264-1.jpg
<CriticKitten> ....um. Now I'm no scientist but i'm pretty sure no matter how strong he is, what he's doing would severely strain his glider and would damage his body.
<Ryunosuke> -54C is very very cold :p
*Dark92Enigma You're the one who's out, Gobby........OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!!!!!!
<FlutterMEDIC> der be Boy Scouts in that tram
<Everlasting_Joy> "Let the girl go!"
<Dark92Enigma> DAT DIALOGUE :D
<StinkomanFan> SCOUT ISH SPY
<Dark92Enigma> OFF TO SAVE HER FOR THE SECOND TIME
<Obsidian> Silly CriticKitten, logic has no place in a superhero movie
<cachi01> why do they always have to say let the girl go?
<SirGanjalf> AAAAAAH
<FlutterMEDIC> CASTLE AAAAAGH
<SirGanjalf> say AAAAAAAAAH
<Everlasting_Joy> Aaah!
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten: remember the 1st Superman movie? it had zero logic, yet still, it was awesome
<FlutterMEDIC> AAAAAAAAAAAAH
<CriticKitten> My god, who would have thought that he could just swing under the bridge and grab them both? NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT.
<cachi01> aaaaaaagh
<cachi01> AAAAAAAAAAA
<FlutterMEDIC> AAAAAAAAAAGH
<StinkomanFan> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<CriticKitten> I mean, that would imply he's some sort of superhero who swings on things with a web-like substance
<StinkomanFan> :S
<FlutterMEDIC> god Monty Python is awesome
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten: since it's based on the 60's comic, there was no place for logic
<Dark92Enigma> REEEECOLAAAAAAA
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01: No no, back of the throat, "aaugh."
<Colt_Brovakiin> FlutterMEDIC: /)
<StinkomanFan> The Sixties were weird.

<FlutterMEDIC> Spectrum_Rush: dey be Scumbag Steves, New Yawkers.
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: random junk on the road? :D
<Dark92Enigma> Obsidian just a heads-up of how useless she was
<Dark92Enigma> AT THE TIME

<ShyBetaFemale> no
<Shammy> Shizuka...when did he ever do stuff legally?
<Shizuka> 13and if not... why does he think it would work to just uproot the sign?
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - counterpoint: housing codes and the concept of "property" seem rather lax under the sea

<naturefury> go spongebob go
<Michael> perfect world?
<Shizuka> 13Shammy: he's not acting, he just summons up memories of his 25 years of failure

<nerf_soldier> Thank You Shizuka for the awesome stream

<DerpyMuffins> Too bad the other mods dont have endings like Shizuka
<pot80> lets remember back to the good old stream we just watched :P

<MadSurge> Derpy_Hooves: well, Sumica has the seaponies

<MadSurge> I mean, DerpyMuffins
<nerf_soldier> who's the most recent mod to be added to Bronystate?
<Panda> nerf_soldier, ME!
<cachi01> nerf_soldier: idk but kirzstryfe just quitted

<cachi01> phase isnt a mod
<Panda> ^
<MadSurge> Shizuka: will you add some Myst or Journeyman Project to your signature?
<nerf_soldier> Panda: lol
<Spectrum_Rush> phase isnt a mod
<MirrorImage> so, who is watching the space jump now that shizustream is done?
<Michael> brb
<cachi01> me
<Cameh_Dude> me!
<Rustymeat> I think it might be Wrek or nittany
<cachi01> MirrorImage: its kinda boring and im just waiting for the sonic boom
<thelonepony> i want to see!
<pot80> what spacejump?
<MirrorImage> pot80 - there's a guy floating in a balloon about 29 miles off the ground right now
<Sumica> 00,10Technichly I was the last one to be made a mod even though I had been here before most of our recent mods.
<MirrorImage> who's going to skydive
<pony5807> now what
<pot80> ohhh that space jump oops
<nerf_soldier> Thanks Sumica
<naturefury> some redbull guy
<cachi01> redbull gives u wings
<oGriofa> can i get a link to the space jump?
<prince-dari> >cancel it last time because it's 'windy'
<Rustymeat> welp im gonna go play borderlands 2
<Ryunosuke> heh "some redbull guy"
<cachi01> oGriofa: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MrIxH6DToXQ
<cachi01> prince-dari: ikr
<prince-dari> If you're dropping from space, I think it would be pretty fucking windy any day.
<MadSurge> Were you one of the firsts to roam the stream, Sumica?
<oGriofa> thanks cahi01
<Jmo> dabi <3
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari, no it was too windy to go up
<naturefury> what ft is he jumping?
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - it was an issue of wind at ground level
<MirrorImage> and controlling the balloon before release
<Ouroboros> ~120K feet I think
<pot80> hes gon do sonic boom
<RAWRity> bonjour
<prince-dari> Ohai jaymoo <3
<StinkomanFan> JUMP IT
<Jmo> :3
<Ryunosuke> pot80, sonic rainboom :)
<Michael> back
<MirrorImage> those of you that have Discovery Channel can watch the jump there as well
<MirrorImage> Discovery Channel is about a minute ahead of the youtube stream
<cachi01> Ryunosuke: he doesnt have any colour so i dont think he would do a rainboom
<Ryunosuke> shh
<Ryunosuke> :)
<pot80> Ryunosuke: he'd have to go up with a bucket of water for that XD
<Ryunosuke> its the redbull :)
<oGriofa> wouldnt he fall at the same speed earth turns away from him at that point?
<RAWRity> hey, who remembers what the A movie winner was yesterday?
<Jmo> Kung Fu Hustle
<alexxm> RAWRity kung fu hustle
<RAWRity> ah
<MirrorImage> oGriofa - that would imply that his horizontal movement is the same as the earth's spin
<RAWRity> and I remember there was some contention over Colour of Magic, since it's like 3 hours long
<MirrorImage> he's barely moving more than 20mph in any given direction
<pot80> how long is it untill jump
<pot80> ?
<MirrorImage> 15-20 minutes i think
<spud> http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
<oGriofa> MirrorImage: Thats how orbit works silly.
<Ryunosuke> he's at 96k ft
<Ryunosuke> little over
<MirrorImage> oGriofa - yes, but the earth spins at several hundred miles per hour
<MirrorImage> 20mph is hardly enough for orbit
<spud> 8mph
<PeachStreak|waking> howdy everypony how are y'all
<Silver_Soother> Hello everypony, how are your days going?
<spud> http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm doing GREAT
<ShyBetaFemale> i want to go PARTY
<thelonepony> Hi Silver_Soother :)
<Ryunosuke> o/
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/561942_479294305437748_1311543982_n.jpg
<thelonepony> Hi PeachStreak|waking :)
<Michael> i wonder what is going gonna hapen when he falls
<alexxm> how are things Silver_Soother
<naturefury> morning Silver_soother
<pot80> heyah PeachStreak|waking and Silver_Soother
<spud> 15 mins to jump
<Ryunosuke> Michael, he falls
<Michael> yeah, i know
<Silver_Soother> Things are doing pretty good alexxm
<Cypresswolf> 120k ft elevation - is that the limit between landing back on earth & floating off into space?
<spud> 16mph
<StinkomanFan> >Second Highest
<StinkomanFan> WAT
<Michael> but what temperature is gonna reack?
<pikorar> It must be scary to look down at the ground you know and see nothing but darkness and one tiny sphere.
<Michael> reach*
<Ryunosuke> Michael, he has heat plates
<oGriofa> MirrorImage: You fall at terminal velocity pretty fast to, look it up, it has somthing to do with the way earths gravity is, things in orbit are in free fall towards the center if the earth but earth turns away at the same speed that that point, iniciating orbit.
<spud> 98000 ft
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is a fun fact that if he goes straight up, the earth will rotate under him.
<cachi01> wuuuut?
<Ryunosuke> 30km
<spud> hes going west
<pot80> sooo hell end up somewhere like in china then?
<Ryunosuke> winds
<MirrorImage> pot80 - given enough time, possibly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's in the stratosphere if it's warming.
<spud> 30mph
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I swear that if he falls down and ends up knocking down a tiny peg like a pendulum, I'm done.
<nerf_soldier> oGriofa: i'm learning about that in physics
<Michael> anyways, http://i.imgur.com/yaq7A.gif
<MirrorImage> i do wonder what that big red button on the OUTSIDE of the capsule is for
<spud> where is he going to land?
<Ryunosuke> 27-28 mph west
<pikorar> 100,000 feet, whoo!
<naturefury> its over 100,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ryunosuke> 100k feet
<oGriofa> nerf_solider: Am i right then? I think so, I learned about it about 3 years ago so my knowledge is rusty.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<PeachStreak|waking> intresting broadcast :)
<spud> http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
<PeachStreak|waking> i love it <3
<RAWRity> MirrorImage: fireworks
<pot80> I can't wait http://i.imgur.com/Zw3fi.gif
<Cypresswolf> best example I heard of earths rotation was "you could hover off the ground in a helicopter and watch the ground move under you" !1th grade astronomy teacher
<Ouroboros> Somewhere around Roswell, New Mexico.
<Cypresswolf> 11th*
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: well, not WATCH so much as realize it
<spud> 20mph
<RAWRity> since it's too slow for us to actually see it moving. Instead we just eventually realize "Oh, hey, that rock's like 20 feet away now."
<Colt_Brovakiin> wow
<spud> http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
<Colt_Brovakiin> dammit spud we know..
<Cypresswolf> I'd be like watching paint dry - Earth rotating so slowly - like watching shadows strech accross the ground
<thelonepony> ohai Colt_Brovakiin :3
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai thelonepony :)
<Michael> hai Colt_Brovakiin
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Michael :)

<pot80> hallo Colt_Brovakiin
<oGriofa> How fast the earth looks to be depends on your elevation waya from the ground.

<Ryunosuke> Sumica, I would assume just drop the pod
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I heard. What's funny is that I don't even remember since my first choice apparently got removed.*
<Sumica> 00,10stick his hand out the window with a bb gun
<pot80> alexxm: I dont think it would be live if he was definately going to die XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bet they drop the capsule and then let it parachute to the ground.
<Spectrum_Rush> we meet again 240p
<Ninjazz> I need it for now. It shall stay out of necesity.
<Ryunosuke> sumica, I hope his jump clone is up to date :)
<StinkomanFan> So.... When's he gonna jump?
<alexxm> ok pot80
<Sumica> 00,10120k feet
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I don't even enter the lottery. So, yeah. :D
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan - somewhere around 125k feet
<Ryunosuke> when the balloon stops
<SirGanjalf> 36km
<oGriofa> dat audio fix
<Ouroboros> Well the planned jump hieght is around 120K, he's at 110K at the moment, so not that much longer?
<pot80> thats only 2 k left
<cachi01> oh u murricans and your imperial system
<pot80> oh wait
<MirrorImage> Ouroboros - he's ascending at about 1k ft/m, so 10-15 minutes probably
<Aponymouss> Geez dat balloon goin way up 6_9
<naturefury> like 10 more mins if not less
<Silver_Soother> They said something about the vizor being screwy, will they stop if that gets worse?
<Bromany> Hallo everypony
<Ouroboros> Thanks MirrorImage.
<cachi01> hi Bromany :)
<MirrorImage> Silver_Soother - little hard to "stop" at this point
<Ninjazz> GilDash, your call. I suspect neither does a lot of the regs here. Tbh, good thing. Helped me get a chance.
<Michael> hai Bromany
<Sumica> 00,10they should have used a rocket
<thelonepony> Hi Bromany :)
<Shizuka> 13so what's wrong?
<oGriofa> i gotta go guise, ill be back, peace.
<pot80> hey Bromany how arfe
<Sumica> 00,10his heater is broken Shizuka
<cachi01> cya oGriofa
<naturefury> his visor is warm....
<Shizuka> 13oh
<pot80> oops
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should have used a jetpack.
<Jesse_> To the edge of space!
<Silver_Soother> MirrorImage: I suppse you're right....
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - he's got a windshield defroster for his visor like you'd have on your rear car window
<Sumica> 00,10faceplate is not warming up
<Bromany> :)
<MirrorImage> except it's not working
<Michael> spaaace
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Ah, but how do you know I wouldn't pick the same episode as you? That would increase the chances of that episode being shown.
<pikorar> Uh oh....
<naturefury> o not hot enough?
<Jesse_> One small step for man, one....scary as shit leap for that poor man in the balloon.
<Ouroboros> The visor has a demister/deicer built into it, tiny wires running though it to stop it icing up.
<pikorar> They should have brought an extra suit. -.-
<Ouroboros> But they're not working.
<Tailsy> his face is gonna frezze off....
<Silver_Soother> Jesse_: Indeed. Lol.
<Michael> that's a lie
<Michael> he's playign space invaders
<Ryunosuke> just past 34km
<Michael> *playing
<cachi01> they just want to make shit intense
<naturefury> i bet hes wishing he brought a gameboy...
<pot80> One small step for man... then a hell of alot of falling for man XDD
<cachi01> i bet he has a pinkie pie in his pockey
<cachi01> pocket+
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I don't. But there's the thing about having YOUR choice picked. Even though around 20 other people could have picked the same one, it doesn't have the same effect of having your own named called out with the responsi-wow I should shut up.
<Bromany> what height did he want to reach before he jumps ?
<pot80> noooo buffer
<MirrorImage> Bromany - about 120 thousand feet
<SirGanjalf> 36km/120ft
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I can some my response up in one simple word. You ready for it? Meh. XD
<SirGanjalf> *120 k ft
<Ninjazz> Saw it coming.
*Jmo sits on Ninjazz
<Bromany> 36 km 0.0
<Ninjazz> NOW back to killing things.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess space radiation levels are good as well.

<Ninjazz> I'm terrible lumbar support, jaymoo.
<Jmo> Ah well
<Tailsy> they passed
<cachi01> aaaaaaaaaaand NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWW RECOOOOOOOOOOOOORD!!!!!!
<MadSurge> GilDash: who's your favorite pony again?
<cachi01> read that with the mario party announcer voice
<Silver_Soother> We must thank this balloon for its hard work and determination to float all the way up there. God bless you Balloon.
<Aponymouss> yay record :)
<SirGanjalf> To the infinity and beyond!
<pikorar> Whoo!
<Sumica> 00,10he's still well withen the protection area of earth magnetic feeld nitt

<GilDash> MadSurge: She would approve of what Felix here is about to do. :D
<Ouroboros> Now just the tricky bit to go.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not much atmopsheric protection. Extreme UV issue.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*atmospheric
<pikorar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GAKOLOnfV4 music for the jump
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - his suit and the pod are good for that i'd imagine
<MirrorImage> pikorar - is that Ride of the Valkries?
<Sumica> 00,10UV yes, but not solar radiation
<Alchemist> hi pepople!
<pikorar> MirrorImage: Rocket Man.

<Sumica> 00,10yeah RAWRity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01About 22 miles.
<Ryunosuke> he's... I want to say polish, but definately not american
<RAWRity> man, that guy must have taken a LOT of Red Bull to be doing this.
<RAWRity> Like, he's gonna need a lot of fucking wings.
<MirrorImage> RAWRity - he's got a life time supply of the stuff at this point i'd imagine
<Ryunosuke> Austrian
<Sumica> 00,10he's gonna unzip and take a leak when he steps out RAWRity
<MirrorImage> oh, that's a great idea for another record RAWRity - highest wing suit jump
<naturefury> if only he road a dirt bike on his way down THEN it would be rely cool
<Alchemist> so this goes up several kilometers and jump out? umm, for what?
<SirGanjalf> No, this piece is perfect: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gqT6En2O78 :P

<Dark_Horst> J_E_Smith71: well, they have to equalize cabin and outside pressure, do they not? wouldnt be helpful if he got thrown off balance by an airrush when opening the hatch
<MirrorImage> he's depressurizing the cabin now
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai XylemTube
<J_E_Smith71> Dark_Horst: Oh I don't know about these things.
<Petrified_Discord> StinkomanFan: Are you asking for a challenge?
<ekips> the livestream has at least 20 seconds delay, they will shut if down is something terrible happens
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm listening to a rather dark background song, and it goes good with the situation.
<MirrorImage> and climbing to above 128 thousand feet
<Tailsy> thatsss a very nice pod you have there...
<Ryunosuke> sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

<Ryunosuke> for the suit
<pot80> pam
<ekips> MirrorImage I'm aware that the youtube stream is delayed more, I myself am watching on another site. That's why I said at least
<Panda|Drawing> now watch the rest of that pressure drop off, SO EXCITING *squee*
<pot80> damn internet froze again
<J_E_Smith71> Silver_Soother: And the people on Discovery Channel will still get to see the bloody carange if they're ahead of the stream
<Sumica> 00,10no shit, like we did't know that

<Petrified_Discord> Avoid any fast spin or tumblrs
<Dark_Horst> Panda|Drawing: smart way of saying "almosT2
<nerf_soldier> he should be in the superman position when he jumps
<GilDash> Panda|Drawing: There's still stuff up there. A vaccuum is space devoid of any particles.
*Panda|Drawing doesnt tumble or spin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wonder how much heat he'll build up from atmospheric friction.
<Everlasting_Joy> Human's can't see infrared.

<Sumica> 00,10the internal air presure is only 100k feet
<J_E_Smith71> He's not high enough he'll burn up in the atmosphere will he?
<Ryunosuke> Sumica, I gathered that now
<MirrorImage> yeah, that confused me for a moment too sumica

<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: Also, I don't know how much of your goal involves actually losing weight, but allow me to suggest watching what you eat. Not super dieting, but like... 1800 cal/day instead of 2000. It's much easier to control what you eat daily than force yourself to exercise daily
<alexxm> how are things Sonny

<GilDash> kirzstryfe: Probably quite high, actually. We can hope otherwise though.
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: I have a night out with friends every wednesday, eat half a pizza and drink 2-3 sodas. Over the course of Thursday, I can swing back down 8 pounds
<RAWRity> 2 minutes feels like 2 years for him
<SirGanjalf> i can see the silhoutte now
<Petrified_Discord> alexxm: On top of someone :P
*Dark92Enigma Guile's theme goes very well with this <------------

<Ryunosuke> his o2 is dropping kinda fast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Up to 1/2 mile of running from zip a few weeks ago.

<Silver_Soother> 4:19 long free fall. Well played.
<kirzstryfe> better to pull before you pass out Wrek
<MadSurge> RAWRity: he got other 3 though
<Panda|Drawing> he almost beat the record
<Ryunosuke> he didnt get the longest freefall, but still pretty damned impressive
<GilDash> Looks he's good. :)
<Cameh_Dude> :D:D:D YEA!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think 70.
<Gold_Demona> He's okay!!!
<Sumica> 00,10is that the bad chute?

<Sonny> lol
<SirGanjalf> Kickinger approves:P
<Alchemist> i thought he would open the chute much later
<Stormy> Hey
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: The body compensates for lack of nutrition.
<Sumica> 00,10shut up mike tod
<StinkomanFan> YOU BRILLIANT, CRAZY RICH BASTARD!
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord, your body starts to store fat and burn muscle due to mal nutrition.
<Michael> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh..
<Sonny> :D
<Wrek> 05now
<Sonny> daaaaammmmnnnnn
<Colt_Brovakiin> Why didn't he help Luna down!
*Dark92Enigma Insert Rocky's final bell music ''WIN!''
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: It's why you can starve yourself, lose weight and begin to put it back on even if you're eating bugger all.
<Ta_Dikin> wow
<Wrek> 05how did redbull afford this shit
<kirzstryfe> $4/can
<cachi01> Wrek: ikr
<Sonny> my OC nows that feel bro
<Yahooz> because theyre red bull
<RAWRity> Wrek: wings
<Sumica> 00,10cause they charge 5 bucks a can wrek
<Sonny> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel I'm eating enough.
<HavokOC> You guys watching red bull stratos?
<Alchemist> Wrek: isnt this baumgartner guy a millionaire?
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord, I had to go to a dietition because i also had issues loosing wieght and have tried numerous diets >.>
<SirGanjalf> Redbull is expensive as fuck.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just not snacking.
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: GilDash is right to a point. Again, 1800 vs 2000 calories. Pushing it down to 1200 will probably hurt, 1500 might be doable.
<Petrified_Discord> "We can't find you." Very reassuring
<MadSurge> HavokOC: yep
<Cameh_Dude> wow
<oGriofa> I thought he was going to die
<pot80> why didnt he have an on board camera :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll do 1800 or 2000 to be safe.
<Jesse_> Red Bull could afford this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But no snacks.
<Jesse_> This is like around a million dollar project.
<Sumica> 00,10sorry gave you the wrong infor *thud*
<cachi01> Jesse_: even more
<ASoftFluffyThing> Jesse_: Red Bull charges like 5 bucks a can
<Dark_Horst> welp. 5 bucks a can
<Everlasting_Joy> "Red Bull didn't give me wings! I'd be safe if I had their wings!"
<alexxm> damn this guy is good
<SirGanjalf> Jesse_: Million dollar isn't even close.
<Alchemist> Jesse_: Im sure the baumgartner guy paid for much of this.
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord well... you know... I was told that if you eat 5 small meals a day it will keep your metabolism up. It worked for me. I droped from 280 to 200 >.>
<Yahooz> hes close
<XylemTube> I feel like that spin at the begining fucked up the fall
<Bronysith> is slenderman going to show up now?
<naturefury> donate money to staving childern? na spend it all on some record breaking event
<oGriofa> Jesse_: Isn't red bull owned by CocaCola though?
<Wrek> 05Jesse_: dollars arent that high on the exchange market nowadays
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: Really, big part of dieting is just awareness. A lot of things us "normal americans" eat are sooo high in calories. If you eat out, you might as well just assume 1000 calories for the meal
<Sumica> 00,10watch out for the chopper felix
<Cameh_Dude> how do you use italics on this chat?
<Wrek> 05and the owner is a millionare

<XylemTube> I fee like buying some redbull now lolololol
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: doesn't mean you stop eating out, esp with friends, but limit it. And order water, not soda, soda is ridiculously overpriced anyways
*Cameh_Dude thanks
<Dark_Horst> "dont come fucking close guys"
<Cameh_Dude> xD

<MirrorImage> i say we spam it with "Who is your favorite pony"
<Tailsy> i'm back. did he make it?
<prince-dari> If he was going at 729 mph at his fastest
<cachi01> MirrorImage: LETS DO IT
<prince-dari> I make that 325 m/s
<Colt_Brovakiin> Tailsy: He died...
<Michael> Wb Tailsy
<prince-dari> And speed of sound is about 330 m/s
<Cameh_Dude> MirrorImage For Celestia!
<Ta_Dikin> Felix is best pony!
<Colt_Brovakiin> not really
<Colt_Brovakiin> sorry :P
<nerf_soldier> Sumica: my grandpa actually did that once at a conference

<Jmo> u suk at moths
<Jesse_> Tom fell on him
<Jesse_> He dies
<Jmo> pls go 2 skool
<Yahooz> prince-dari: im pretty sure the speed of sound differs at higher altitudes
<prince-dari> jaymoo STFU
<Jmo> :P;
<Jmo> LOL*
<Jesse_> Look out! Here comes Tom!
<Tailsy> seriously though, did he make it?
<SirGanjalf> He landed safely... but then the capsule crushed him/
<Yahooz> because different mediums
<prince-dari> Yahooz: Well what altitude are hey taking it at?
<Spectrum_Rush> Jaymoo its sunday no skool fo dabi
<Jmo> Sunday skool
<J_E_Smith71> Tailsy: Yep, he did
<Michael> brb
<prince-dari> I would have thought sea level, since that's standard.
<Jmo> go.
<Sumica> 00,10no he did't make it he payed for it but science made it
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - i think so as well. They were just referring to "Mach," which is a fixed unit
<Yahooz> prince-dari: i believe he free fell at 28,000 ft
<Tailsy> excellent
<Jesse_> Sumica: poor soul, he never stood a chance against Tom's weight.
<Blako> hi
<Sumica> 00,10toms weight is noting compared to garrys girth
<Yahooz> now he would have to accelerate quite a bit... but im thinking he did it. barely at that
<Petrified_Discord> Those 4 minutes passed pretty fast for me, but imagine how long it must've felt to HIM.
<Jesse_> XD
<MirrorImage> so... bets on how many Rainbow Dash in a Flight Suit pics will be in the next 2 Drawfriends?
<Yahooz> what Sumica said
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: :D

<Kimori> umm no
<prince-dari> Well I made his speed 325 m/s
<prince-dari> Which is less than mach 1

<Petrified_Discord> Sceince killed youtube.
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<Yahooz> dari had he achieved 325 m/s at 20000 ft he would have broken the sound barrier by 10m/s
<Sumica> 00,10you need air for sound
<cachi01> ^^^^
<DashWithRainbows> Youtube is down? Still got it for me.
<J_E_Smith71> ...I wonder though if YouTube's not working if the press conference will still run even if we have the embed on here
<JRP> I NEEDS MY YOUTUBE
<Gold_Demona> Too many people watching Kerbal man. :P
<JRP> NOW!!!!!!!!
<MadSurge> TOO AWESOME FOR YOUTUBE
<Applejack2012> Derpy save us!
<Yahooz> WRONG. you need a MEDIUM for sound :p
<JRP> "502. That’s an error."
<JRP> LOLOL
<alexxm> so Dark92Enigma who do you think is the worst wrestler currently with the wwe
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, thats because EVERYONE in the world is uploading the same video :)

<Sumica> 00,10fuck medium I keep my sound at max
<Jesse_> I tweeted Stratos asking who is best pony..:P
<Midnight_Splendor> Hi everypony
<cachi01> Jesse_: same here lol
<Yahooz> prince-dari: his goal wasnt mach 1, it was the sound barrier :p
<cachi01> hi Midnight_Splendor :)
<thelonepony> Hi Midnight_Splendor :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<Invi> youtube works for me
<Ouroboros> Intermittent youtube server errors.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Midnight_Splendor
<prince-dari> Well I could fucking break the sound barrier at 8000000000ft
<Silver_Soother> Would somepony mind pinging me when the conference starts? I'm going to mute the stream and do some voiceover work.
<Applejack2012> and Youtbe back
<alexxm> how are things Midnight_Splendor
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wouldn't terminal velocity prevent him from ever reaching the speed of sound anyway?
<Yahooz> I can break the sound barrier in 0g
<prince-dari> NewSuperBronyU: Barely any air up at that altitude
<Spectrum_Rush> dat db
<PeachStreak|LAPP> here have some twilick sparkle :D http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=my+little+pony+funny&offset=336#/d525nl4
<Applejack2012> sound barrier killed the Youtube
<Jesse_> He had to have an oxygen tank
<Jesse_> They counted down the minutes left of his oxygen.
<Sumica> 00,10Terminal velocy varrys based on air presure
<alexxm> is youtube down for anyone else
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: I NEEDS MY YOUTUBY
<Yahooz> Im like 95 percent sure he broke the sound barrier
<LunasGuard> ello everpony
<Applejack2012> good evening
<SirGanjalf> eeyup, YT
<alexxm> how are things LunasGuard
<SirGanjalf> *YT's dead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Terminal velocity would be fast way up in the atmosphere.
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai LunasGuard :)
<prince-dari> Yeah, but not at sea level.
<prince-dari> Which is best level.
<Sumica> 00,10Youtube works fine for me
<MadSurge> PeachStreak|LAPP: aaaand through her head :D
<prince-dari> All the other levels can go suck a dick
<SirGanjalf> Looks like that was too much for their servers
<LunasGuard> hi alexxm Colt_Brovakiin
<Yahooz> At sea level is for SQUARES
<Sumica> 00,10this makes me want to play some kerbal
<MadSurge> prince-dari: I'm at sea level!
<Yahooz> its too STANDARD for society
<LunasGuard> alexxm: great thanks for asking, and ur self
<Jmo> Dabi
<Jmo> Go work for NASA already
<alexxm> i'm good LunasGuard have a bit of headache but it'll go

<PeachStreak|LAPP> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=my+little+pony+funny&offset=360#/d58yud5
<pot80> on the toilet?
<prince-dari> First, you need more fucking rockets, then some explosions, and finally, lasers, LOTS OF LASERS.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: OK, let's leave John Cena out, because....even if he's the Superman, he has skill, but he's stuck in the Hogan push.......i say Heath Slater by comparison to the rest. then goes The Great Khali. only because his ''skills'' have been watered down with time
<Yahooz> if you multiply Gary's girth by gravity at sea level, you proove that Gary Oak can achieve mach 7 by falling 2 inches
<J_E_Smith71> YouTube just came back up
<LunasGuard> Is this that daredavil thats jumping from space
<prince-dari> Lawl Yahooz
<JRP> youtube servers probley took a dump
<Applejack2012> until now
<Yahooz> Now, this means that Gary Oak is likely made of dark matter
<Yahooz> which explains ALOT
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma yeah i was going to say the freat khali myself but i heard vladimer kozlef was pretty bad when he was with the company
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmmm perhaps some filler till I have to go.

<Saturn> 08,01which is a much better mental image
<Lyra`> and a featherd cap
<Shizuka> 13prince-dari: pantyhose is thinner than tights, there's some threshold of the thread count that determines which is which
<Chrysalis> but they give people headaches
<Bronysith> Saturn: and now im just imagining asuka in silk stockings
<Chrysalis> damn those lightbulbs
<thelonepony> Hi BladedWings :)
