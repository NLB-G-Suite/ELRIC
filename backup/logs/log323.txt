<Lasharus> Then I'm afraid not.
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity, I suppose I was, and I appologize for that.
<RAWRity> It's just that Apple Bloom in a bunny suit is so cute it's borderline illegal.
<Colt_of_Personality> In her defense, Derpy isn't a very feminine name
<AnonQ> Kencolt: Being a bitch
<richfiles> ^wolf
<Atzel> No one likes you!
<Meanwhile> I never understood how comfy sitting in only your boxers was until this moment.
<Dapperjack> how does she fit her tail in that get up...

<Colt_of_Personality> possibly
<MI9000> UNLESS ITS A FARM
<DSNesmith1> it wasn't that good
<Dapperjack> "UNLESS IT'S A FARM"
<RaveBrony> Bullshit I Cant Hear You!!
<EspyLacopa> Court Martialed!
<EpikAardvark> Silver spoon is referring to the term "born with a silver spoon in the mouth"
<TheMaster> you know why grannysmith is so old? She's a time lord
<TopHat> I think I need to leave guys
<IngloriousPony89> Let me see your WARFACE!!

<ZAFT_Pony> Granny Smith was in the Equestrian Army?

<SaxyPretender> 0,14SuperBrony64|AFK, it never happened.
<TOY_PON3> Fleur are you okay?
<RAWRity> DSNesmith1: it's a story somebody wrote about finding a filly RD in the real world, then having to give her up after raising her. It's essentially a Boy and his Dog story, but with Ponies.
<Kencolt> Nah-- she's just like me. Getting on in years.
<fluttercry> 05,15SB...you got to keep your soul

<Cypresswolf> Sweetie's Raised Eyebrow....she's trouble
<otakon> SuperBrony64: yes, you lucky son of a griffon
<TechRat> does Granny have to choke a filly?
<Atzel> Sun Tzu said that, and I think he knows a little more about fighting than you do, pal; because he invented it!
<Dken2021> and it was awful. For everyone. Including you
<Mines5> Why did I never notice the upper thingy?
<HIHOOF> scootaboot

<naahdude> dem clowns
<RAWRity> My personal problem with MLD is taht it doesn't feel as if they person writing just had a story to tell that was sad. It felt like they were trying every cliche/trope they could to try to make me sad. Didn't feel like an organic story, but rather manipulative.
<Dandelo> SweetieBelle.exe has stopped working

<pony_362> I hate to see it if Derpy consumes it
<this> lol
<RaveBrony> O_o
<DSNesmith1> four is the tastiest number
<IngloriousPony89> Equestria Walmant= Barnyard Bargins
<pikorar> Senile.
<Dandelo> Dat chalk
<Skipper> gasp
<Sauceboss> and dats gonna be akward
<BioBeats> How Dare SHE
<Skitsmore> :O
<pony_7237> awww
<HIHOOF> dam hater
<Colt_Magnum> dandelo, u could even say they owned mayor mare.
<Dapperjack> "fuck yo shit tiara"
<klopki> dawwwwwww
<RaveBrony> Mmmmm, chalk
<Djambi> squish
<emangamer> actually she is a kookey old lady
<Scootaloo> squish
<GarrettBrony> yum chalkboard
<RAWRity> Granny Smith salivates at your fancy mathematics
<DerpyDanny> Derpy is canon.
<TOY_PON3> dat fat pony
<Buytoast> And then Diamond Tiara sealed her fate.
<BioBeats> :O
<Moonlight_Mist> ms. cheerlee: I dont know what to do about this"
<ExAxis> I hope Apple Bloom gets her cutie mark tomorrow
<otakon> Respect your elders you little WITCH!
<DerpyDanny> Take dat.
<Dandelo> Powerfull family
<Atzel> bellows on a stove?
<naahdude> and then tiara was stoned to death
<RainbowKitten> Aww kirzstryfe! you don't like clopping?
<PsychedelicBrony> WHY'D SHE EVEN DO THAT HONESTLY
<Dapperjack> uh.. why'd she lick the board?
<Tovler> she's not a lady, she's a pony.
<propainzealot> shes THE cooky old lady
<WhirlSquirrel> DAME AD!
<emangamer> oh my god...gatoraid...I need it
<MI9000> squish
<Kencolt> You know, it's the fact that she's got a tiara JAMMED INTO HER SKULL that explains a lot.
<naahdude> because she's crazy
<Dken2021> I prefer 7s, they get juicy when they eat 9s
<EpikAardvark> Ikr
<K_A> I love how they're studying celestial mechanics. That looks like a sketched-out first-order differential equation.
<Sauceboss> Diamond Tiara is best cupcake flavor
<DerpyDanny> Cuz' chalk is delicious.
<BioBeats> AD
<StinkomanFan> Again, Celestia gets NOTHING for this episode
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> ```How it should have ended >>> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/109469?search=Diamond_Tiara
<Atzel> What sort of crazy heat does that jam need?
<Colt_of_Personality> DT shoulda got detention for that, Cheerilee is high, i swear
<HIHOOF> i want sum toast
<TOY_PON3> Buck you Diamond Tiara!
<Meanwhile> Cannot unsee "Granny Smith salivates" thanks RAWRity.
<Djambi> fat pony...again
<IngloriousPony89> Dame ad? So the ad is a dame then?
<IshBestKitty> I have a new theory on Alicorns, they'res no such thing as an Alicorn, an Alicorn is just a Pegasus that has used its magic to make wings
<Sauceboss> just saying
<K_A> Ponies smarter than humans confirmed.
<klopki> taste the rainbow
<pikorar> Say what you want about her but you can never explain why she chose to lick that chalk.
<Dapperjack> no it's... not
<not_a_cannibal> I'm wearin' my Dash necklace, HBU?
<Everlasting_Joy> 7 is the best number.
<naahdude> good point
<TopHat> You ever pleasure yourself so much your skin starts ripping and bleeding?
<TheMaster> ponies are good at math
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p

<Dapperjack> fat boy! FAT BOY!
<Mines5> OVER 9000 DEGREES!
<Dr_Cheesums> When do you thin CMC's will get their cutie marks?
<pikorar> Maybe it's full of vitamins?
<Colt_Magnum> dandelo, theres an organized criminal family joke in there somewhere
<PinkiePrime> now get your efin cutie mark
<pony_4680> zapapplejammer
<Dandelo> Chalk must be good for the digestion
<ExAxis> Or all of the CMC
<RaveBrony> If the cutie mark crusaders get their cutie marks then we bronies wud be in trouble
<Atzel> she was cleaning up
<SuperCelestia> 0,5inb4 zapapple cutie mark
<ZAFT_Pony> Math is the human equivlent of unicron magic...
<TOY_PON3> d'awwww
<IngloriousPony89> Never Dr_Cheesums
<RAWRity> also, it was really nice to see the CMC doing stuff together that WASN'T about their Cutie Marks
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Which is why to never forget your elder relatives, always give them a call and say hi every so often. It might not be much, but to them, it means a lot.
<K_A> Iweywrt: I'm thinking series finale.
<StinkomanFan> Big Macintosh is tallest pony
<RainbowKitten> And not a single "buck" was given that day
<BioBeats> Im thinkin around season 3
<otakon> IshBestKitty: but that's not possible, the only magic wings are those butterfly wings as we've seen
<Sauceboss> SO how much has this room been filled guys
<EpikAardvark> ^ Exactly
<XaviortheSavior> series finale?
<AJIsBestPony> CMCs will get their cutie marks on the series finale
<flutterfan> pip let him self go
<ExAxis> There is no zap apple cutie mark
<TopHat> why did I say that
<Cypresswolf> Zap Apple Cutie Mark for Applebloom?
<Colt_Magnum> dr_cheesums, when rbd comes out of the closet
<emangamer> Ohai SuperBrony64....
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: what, old ponies can't have spit?
<HIHOOF> i do
<pony_1623> OMG
<Dandelo> I think there are some parrots that eat clay or chalk for digestive health
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I know man, I know.
<MI9000> me
<AJIsBestPony> Along with Dash joining the Wonderbolts
<PsychedelicBrony> big surprise, applebloom's cutie mark has to do with apples!!
<Kencolt> I know it sometimes meanssomething to me.
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: eenope, Celestia

<Amras0000> not at all
<LordCelestia|AFK> 0,5>_>
<Meanwhile> No.
<RAWRity> my opinion on Blazing Saddles was that, while it had funny gags in it, a lot of them were either ruined, or messed up by poor editing.
<StinkomanFan> no
<IngloriousPony89> Well then that's less shameful Al
<VioletGreySha> i go sleep now cya all ;)
<Amras0000> that was to Cynical
<Quin> like will i sleep okay?
<RAWRity> LordCelestia|AFK: no. I did not.
<DSNesmith1> I thought about applying for modship, then decided I prefer screaming in the main chat over having to ban people for posting video links and talking in colors
<Meanwhile> To be honest and blunt.
<Skipper> how do you do that emangamer?
<not_a_cannibal> The story get's pretty violent but not as bad as cupcakes, more Rocket To Insanity gory

<this> i still like last friday night but this is good
<BronyTJ> i hope my video is played
<AJIsBestPony> We need one!
<Kencolt> I, being a wolf, would react to three meat pizza with interest.
<SlurryMoon> 3Everypony will need years of therapy after these movies today
<pikorar> G5 = GOD TIER CARTOON!
<CynicalBrony> How has this website not been shut down? It seems like something like this would arouse suspicion.
<not_a_cannibal> It's Schwarzenegger
<Monkey_Zombie> Fluttershy voiced by Woddy Allen
<Quin> cannibal does scootaloo live?
<emangamer> SlurryMoon: but....but...my pony episode.... :'(

<Skipper> dashie is best pony
<Monkey_Zombie> Twilight Sparkle voiced by Jeff Gollbum
<not_a_cannibal> It doesn't specify at the end
<Iweywrt> Do a video of when derpy talked :3
<BronyTJ> my video is a review of epic movie btw. so much better than the actual movie
<Mines5> NEXT video must be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQy5dY2JzQ&feature=g-hist&context=G2921f5cAHTyDslwAMAA
<Quin> *gulps*
<Monkey_Zombie> and Rainbow Dash voiced by Sylvester Stalone.
<richfiles> To whom ever is running the stream... THANK YOU for leaving the title of the vid visible. No more need to ask what we are watching... THANKS!
<Mines5> is absolutely hilarious XD
*RAWRity doesn't particularly like Mumford and Sons
<not_a_cannibal> No, really, there's a cliffhanger
<StinkomanFan> And now we play the waiting game
<pikorar> Colt_Magnum: No, I think if there's a G5 it will just be G4 continued with new characters. The Mane 6 will have gotten old and replaced by characters just as loveable.
<Iweywrt> Derpy is good therapy
<AJIsBestPony> Request it in #vinyl_scratch
<soldier> i do believe you have an interesting concept their Monkey.
*Fleur feels bad that Taby didnt know Derpy was a girl :(
<Colt_Magnum> g5 = cmc
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved is back !!! : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
<Skipper> "I just don't know what went wrong"
<DSNesmith1> this ain't doing it for me
<Kencolt> There was no suh movie!
<emangamer> I wonder... does Luna get pinged whenever someone pings LunaTheBeloved?
<DSNesmith1> which is unusual because RAWRity and I have polar opposite tastes
<not_a_cannibal> It lets you use your imagination
<AJIsBestPony> I think FIM will run for 3-4 seasons then we will get a spinoff, probably with the CMCs, and probably not as good
<Monkey_Zombie> It would be funny if it was scripted right.
<RawketLawnchair> Derpy 's voice reminded me of Ed from EEnE.
<LunaTheBeloved> What was that link some one sent me?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy BronyTOM
<RawketLawnchair> Am I the only one?
<pikorar> The 3 CMC, Snails, Snips, and Twist are all the new Elements in G5.
<emangamer> RawketLawnchair: not really....yea you are the only one
<TopHat> It would be funny if it was scripted right.
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
<RAWRity> this just feels like watered down Folk Punk to me.
<AJIsBestPony> Lol twist?
<RawketLawnchair> Bah.
<Colt_Magnum> fim will have 7 seasons then get canceled midseason in the 7th
<richfiles> LOL... Mammoth died int he gate to teh fort
<LunaTheBeloved> <3
<DSNesmith1> there's nothing catchy in this
<StinkomanFan> I hate country music
<tvoie> this syncs up suprisingly well with "live & learn"
<DSNesmith1> it's just bland
<StinkomanFan> so much
<SlurryMoon> 3that sophisticated Luna x3
<Mines5> adorable :D
<richfiles> At least bodies go "no clip" when they die
*emangamer smokes on his corn cob pipe "quite LunaTheBeloved....quite"
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: this...isn't country music.
<pikorar> She's a late bloomer, she gets less hated when she's older.
<soldier> well i must agree but also state that most anything scripted correctly would be appealing in a comedic or other sence
<richfiles> still funny... it takes the entire arch.
*emangamer feels like Fancy Pants
*LunaTheBeloved puts on her monocle
<StinkomanFan> I'm just saying
*DerpyHooves` hugs LunaTheBeloved
<DSNesmith1> lol
<Iweywrt> So are the B movies always like epic movie?
<Buck> good evening everypony
<Darf14> wow, that is fancy

<this> srry messed up
<DSNesmith1> I know the words to every country song they played on the radio from 97-01
<StinkomanFan> My father works at a Country station ofcourse

<RawketLawnchair> Ditzy Doo, I wub you.
<TopHat> I like the Beatles

*kirzstryfe pokes Shizuka
<Lasharus> Good taste TopHat.
<Mines5> Well Welcome, Bronies are widely varied in attitude XD
<pikorar> I'm just assuming in my own little dream world and in my bubble of personal mental safety that that is how MLP will be continued and it will be just as awesome. Just be super duper overly optmistic. Don't want to think about MLPFIM ending.
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo: you crashed my browser
<Shizuka> 13*pff*
<RawketLawnchair> Hey, easy with the wub button there, Shizuka
<LunaTheBeloved> Wubbity wub wub

*emangamer wubs Shizuka and DerpyHooves` will ALL of his subwoofer (that is the maximum amount of wub possible)
<soldier> twas a fine video
<Valistar> Fluttershy fans are mute.
<Monkey_Zombie> Rarity: RAINBOW DASH...please....stop moving...your going to ruin...my dress!
<Al> Why Scoot always get the blame!
*kirzstryfe pulls everypony into a glomp pile
<not_a_cannibal> I don't remember who, but they mentionedIron Maiden earlier
<AJIsBestPony> Yeah, I see what you mean, enjoy it while its here, no need to think about the end of it
<Colt_Magnum> mlp will not continue, g5 will be a relaunch
<Kencolt> Too much wub. Cab we have some wike to clear our palates?

<StinkomanFan> Me gusta
<Mines5> awww, I hope you do my video, it really is funny
<Lasharus> *grin*
<pikorar> SHHHH! Pinkie's singing.
<RAWRity> Country can be good when it's actually about something genuine, but 99% of the time with most modern country songs, you just get a lot of "Oh yeah, life sure is great here in Nashville. and I like Jimmy Buffet."
<NullRadix> I'm not sure they usually do a pick as much as a "roll down the line"
<Dan_MoCa> oh boy
<DSNesmith1> uh oh, this sounds like it's going to get screamy
<TopHat> because the timbre wolves
<Al> this song is actually hilariously awesome
<emangamer> MirrorImage: I feel aweful for Iweywrt....
<SlurryMoon> 3All the wub and glomps!

<Lasharus> Dr. Robotnik is BACK!
<RawketLawnchair> I am the Eggmare, that is who I am. I am the Eggmare, I got the master plan.
<MirrorImage> what for emangamer?
<NullRadix> but depends on the moment I suppose
<emangamer> MirrorImage: this was his first BMN
<Shrimp3000> Hello everypony.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's a safe bet, kirzstryfe
<DSNesmith1> the only country song I've ever liked was "what was I thinking"
<Lasharus> Dr. Robotnik is BACK! MWAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!
<Derpy_Hooves88> herro
<Kimori> there are times when I wonder if the skylanders toys will just sell for real cheap a year from now
<RaveBrony> :P
<LunaTheBeloved> who else could it have been kirz?
<AJIsBestPony> we need more of The Great and Powerful Trixie
<StinkomanFan> Goo Goo G'joo
<DSNesmith1> oh, and "devil went down to georgia" of course
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> What is My Little Amnesia..? It's in my recommneded vids, but I'm not sure that I want to click it...
*Skipper performs a sonic rainboom to impress Rainbow_Dash
<ExAxis> Came back
<pikorar> Yes, yes and YES.
<BronyTOM> hey there
<Darf14> Dr. Eggpony
<Lasharus> And what a good guess kirzstryfe. :P
<ExAxis> :D I approve of this
<emangamer> Lasharus: his name is robotnick...he makes robots and turns things into robots... its ROBOTNIC
<RawketLawnchair> Perfect in every way.
<Al> Skipper >u<
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:)
<Everlasting_Joy> That's a good one.
<not_a_cannibal> Can't remember who though
<BronyTOM> so this is where I can watch the newest episode?
<pikorar> Trixie for Queen of Equestria 2012.
*emangamer is unimpressed by Skipper's trick
<AJIsBestPony> We better get a The Great and Powerful Trixie episode either this season or next
*IshBestPony hugs Fleur
*TOY_PON3 became a brony this past summer
<Kencolt> I think in my case it was about August, or so... maybe earlier. Heard stuff on the Net... wondered what the fuss was about.... had the Hub on my cable... and fell into the herd.
<Everlasting_Joy> Yes.
<AnonyPony-EQD> Back
<emangamer> IshBestPony: I though you were going to stop giving Fleur hugs
*Al frowns at emangamer
<ExAxis> I am the eggman
<Iweywrt> Thanks so much guys for the warm welcome :)
<StinkomanFan> I hate that my family wont SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP at 10:30 AT NIGHT
<Colt_Magnum> what would happen if a parasprite got a taste of princess mollestia's god-blood?
<Lasharus> emangamer - actually, it's ROBOTNIK.

<Derpy_Hooves88> i am the derpyman
<pikorar> Or else I'll kick the current director's ass out the door and bring in the bronies to assume control for the sake of making a Trixie episode.
<Shrimp3000> I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, I am the walrus. GOO GOO G'JOOB!
<emangamer> IshBestPony: what?
<Lasharus> Love you too emangamer. :p
<Mines5> thats how most convert, are curious and find show entertaining

<badass_Derpy> yo no is talking
<AnonyPony-EQD> Oh crap there is a parasprite
<Everlasting_Joy> Come early and watch us rage at Strawberry shortcake.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Not sure if best pony is Dashie, Fluttershy, Twilight, Luna or Celestia.
<Colt_Magnum> poor seth
<RawketLawnchair> Are you a troll?
<IshBestPony> emangamer because ponies
<Skitsmore> In the near futre
<AJIsBestPony> What? But The Great and Powerful Trixie must have more time in the spotlight!
<RawketLawnchair> Also, Celestia is best pony.
<emangamer> Skipper: There is only one other pony who's name you could mutter to make me hate you SO MUCH more...
<zavidon345> yep

<Dan_MoCa> but in Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't Robotnik supossed tobe Dr. Robotnik, as in Eggman's grandpa or something related to that?

<Al> Awwwww!
<Kencolt> otakon: It's Eggman in the original Japanese versions. But that would sound silly to US players, so they made it Robotnik-- which isn't MUSH less silly, but...

<TopHat> #Vinyl_Scatch
<MistarFish> This intro
<Dandelo> Then I saw Italians.
<Everlasting_Joy> I don't know, this is an awesome intro, but it seems like it gives too much to us.
<AnonQ> CANCERRRRRR
<Amras0000> this theme
<Nightwing> Darf14 i don't remember it being so long
<Jake_Kulp> the italian opening
<not_a_cannibal> #Vinyl_Scratch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRx_iXgLAyw
<AnonQ> UBERCANCER
<SlurryMoon> 3This is really great opening
*TopHat snickers
<this> 20% cooler opening then ours
<K_A> Heh, they got a brony with After Effects knowledge to help. XD
<spiffytech> This theme is so much better!
<soldier> oh i do enjoy this opening song. i find it more exciting than the american one. but thats just me.
<Darf14> It just felt long
<Kencolt> That's the idea-- Italy imports a LOT of anime.
<MirrorImage> Nightwing - it's an extended version
<BronyTOM> will we have to deal with the adds during the episode
<not_a_cannibal> indeed that is good
<RainyRag> WTF is up with nonstop ads?
<Amras0000> it's so monotonous
<AnonyPony-EQD> Iv know
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> We need this opening...
<Colt_Magnum> lyra has talking lines in italian, of course their theme is best pony
<DSNesmith1> I don't even watch the intro
<Iweywrt> Do epic pie time. Its with ponies
<DSNesmith1> the song's enough
<Everlasting_Joy> This feels like something out of an anime.
<Millsbuddy> THIS OPENING FILLS MYY SOUL
<Amras0000> and stereotypical
<AnonQ> Our opening is 20^9001% cooler!
<Dandelo> And my face when American animation is anime in Italy.
<CynicalBrony> I think this is more enjoyable then the American version.
<MirrorImage> kinda like how the season 1 pokemon intro had the "tv version" and the "full version"
<Kyle113> Yeah
<AnonQ> Yeah
<BronyTOM> It is so epic
<Darf14> huh, I wonder what the lyrics are on this intro
*Amras0000 joins TopHat
<BronyTJ> italy is best pony
<fluttercry> 05,15This opening is awesome! THough it does feel a bit anime ish to me
<Dandelo> > Anime Fun
<CynicalBrony> It reminds me of an anime opening.
<soldier> i concur cynical
<Iweywrt> EPIC PIE TIME! please!
<AnonyPony-EQD> Germany is the best pony
<K_A> I really like this theme. :O
<BronyCon> PONYYYY
<AnonQ> NEEDS EPIC PIE TIME
<kirzstryfe> 1,3.1: you have to post that in the actual chat channel, and 2: you probably won't get rainbow factory played
<RaveBrony> ^
<Derpy_Hooves88> yes more applejack!!!! this pleases DERPY
<MirrorImage> watch the allcaps people
<AnonQ> >Anime Fun
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> This opening is pure win!
<AnonyPony-EQD> But Germany and Italy to-geather makes the best lulz
<Darf14> wow, they out did the american theme
<BronyCon> its not rainbow factory
<Dan_MoCa> in harmony, great adventures they shall have
<DSNesmith1> is it "non ti fermade"?
<MistarFish> Die in a fire derpy 88
<Al> it's too anime for my taste as well, but I won't negate it's awesomeness hehe
<OhioBronyShow> I made up the first part of the first chorus' believed translation: "Cause we are My Little Ponies, weekly entertaining the bronies!"
<Nightwing> MirrorImage i was talking about the last one
<otakon> y'know
<not_a_cannibal> HAHA but why? it's a good song!

<DSNesmith1> hey, search for "TOR theme song" and play the first result
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<LionKimbro> Only in Toronto.
<RaveBrony> Aw, missed that one
<Skipper> it was SOPA's flaut
<RAWRity> oh hey, it's that game that finally came out.
<pony_2027> This video is no longer available due to copyright claim
<fluttercry> 05,15But this game SUUUUCKS
<Lasharus> This makes no sense. :P
<pikorar> I really botched it up.
<Tovler> YTP: 4 laughs Epic Movie: 0
<DSNesmith1> SINKING SHIP GENERAL
<Arentius> why a swtor trailer o.O
<emangamer> Thetrollside: umm...why are you poking me?
<Kencolt> Are these really requests?
<Lasharus> I mean, it's neither pony NOR funny. It's quite good, but huh?
<Quin> im on ps3 WAY more often though :/
<TheMaster> the hole is a feature!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Moar ponies, plz?
<StinkomanFan> A Star Wars game how original
<AJIsBestPony> If they're gonna play a game trailer, play the Skyrim one!
<TheMaster> the sinking ship effects everyone so its not a bug
<CheshireKitten> Trailer is pretty.
<Dandelo> In Star Wars... No one is gay.
<DSNesmith1> I actually had hope for this game after seeing this trailer
<Kimori> oh
<Skitsmore> Star wars, *jizz*
<CheshireKitten> Pity the game doesn't look as good.
<DSNesmith1> then I saw the gameplay
<pikorar> Everybody's seen that.
<RaveBrony> Well, im going to bed everypony!!! Gotta wake up so I can see you all here during the new episode! :P
<Kimori> um what do you mean not so great?
<Skipper> seriously i mean... SERIOUSLY?????
<Inquisitor> This game is nothing compared to the Warhammer 40,000 Dark Millenium Trailer
<CosmicEevy> In Skyrim, everyone is lesbians
<KawaiiGod> oo
<Mudora> still torn on whether or not the game is worth the money
<AJIsBestPony> Except C-3PO
<TopHat> I used to play Xbox
<Tovler> man, games from 2009 are so blocky
<emangamer> I am not impressed by trailers that are nothing but CGI and no gameplay
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Alrighty guys! Its time for me to hit the hay (lol puns). I'll see you all later and its good to be back!
<TOY_PON3> night RaveBrony
<not_a_cannibal> What's your PS3 GT?
<fluttercry> 05,15well anyway, I'm going to bed. Goodnight eveypony, See you all in the morning
<DSNesmith1> I for one don't think they're charging ENOUGH for this game
<otakon> it's a BIOWARE star wars game!
<Shrimp3000> They're releasing Star Wars in 3D soon.
<LionKimbro> I'm not seeing any ponies here.
<Shrimp3000> Ugh
<TOY_PON3> night fluttercry
<DSNesmith1> I'd gladly pay 30 dollars a month for this
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later fluttercry!
<TheMaster> have you ever designed a ship before? they wouldn't spend $500 million dollars if they didn't know what they were doing

<Arentius> whoever put up the vid is a silly filly
<RAWRity> hey, at least Lucas isn't writing it.

<otakon> Arentius: that would be SuperBrony64
<pikorar> Shit.
<LionKimbro> The Force of Friendship?
<soldier> and i do believe that building will need a large amount of repairs
<rainbow> damn newfag sith
<StinkomanFan> Tru dat
<DSNesmith1> it affects everyone equally
<Arentius> I mean on youtube...calling it a trailer
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i r teh silleh filly :3
<TheMaster> remember when star wars was more than lightsabers and jedi?
<TOY_PON3> I'm more of a Sith type of guy >.>
<not_a_cannibal> I'll tell you mine then it's infernoquest441
<CheshireKitten> Darf14: Nonsense. Bioware subscribed to the Square Enix model of game trailers: show absolutely NONE of the game to get people psyched up, then release a game of quality far inferior to the trailer and make people mad while you count their money.
<mooponi> i sont
<TheMaster> there were characters that wern't force whatever
<Quin> ok
<mooponi> dont
<StinkomanFan> Note the lack of gameplay footage
<TheMaster> remember han solo?
<pikorar> Sith = ACTA Jedi = Teh Internets.
<pony_2027> life is better with sound effects
<Skitsmore> Yes..
<DSNesmith1> the sad thing si
<not_a_cannibal> send me a request sometime I'm on Xbox more often though
<Thetrollside> TheMaster: SWTOR is 1-4,00 years before all dat
<NullRadix> psh... gameplay? what do we need that for? its star wars!
<AJIsBestPony> So Darth Vader is the MPAA then?
<DSNesmith1> this little five minute video is better than episodes 1 and 2
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<TopHat> I was joking, I wasn't trying to offend anyone
<Dandelo> Star Wars, the universe where you can tell good from bad by laser color.
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: well, this is more to get people excited for the story
<Dashie> I have arrived everyone, better late then never?
<Thetrollside> 4,000*
<Dashie> =]
<Dandelo> If only things were that easy.
<Arentius> ..its 3000 years before the films
<TheMaster> can you believe that he was a cool character and he didn't have to be a jedi
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Dashie!

<TheMaster> heresey toy_pon3. han shot first
<Kencolt> well, to be honest, there's not a PC existing that COULD pull off this kind of graphics in online gameplay, and anypony who thinks otherwise is a dolt.

<Lasharus> You're welcome.
<CheshireKitten> Ken: No one blames them for having a shiny trailer and weaker video, honestly....it's more the fact that the trailer misled them into thinking it was different than it was.

As long as we enjoy it, others should not judge upon it.

<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I'm going to hit the hay here folks. Thanks for the fun tonight (it's nice to spend it with vets as oppose to new guys).
<K3Seraph> Heh
<pony_7779> Same Fenrir, I have a piano scholarship audition
<K3Seraph> Colorfully homicidal, you mean
<TheOhioBronyShow> I need to sleep soon, cause I need to get up for MLP and bake cupcakes for my party.

<Fenrir> piano? good luck
<K3Seraph> Dubstep = alien messages
<DSNesmith1> have fun dreaming about epic movie
<OrangeEliminator> dubstep is the reason jesus died on the cross
<CosmicEevy> Hey i like dubstep
<SuperBrony64> 10,02bluestrom_S: wub wub wub
<Dr_Cheesums> Dubstep does not sound like music to me...
<OrangeEliminator> dubstep killed JFK
<Thetrollside> I see all classrooms as a communist type of area....
<not_a_cannibal> mmmm radiation... I actually had a real life Nuka Cola Quantum once... It. Was. GREAT!
<K3Seraph> Heh
<Tovler> lol dat headbob
<Phase4> night Everlasting_Joy
<Dandelo> Needs more blues
<Dr_Cheesums> hate it
<K3Seraph> Dubstep, you can't explain that
<Everlasting_Joy> GAH! Thank goodness I don't dream.

<AnonQ> .
<Darf14> My body is ready for tomorrows episode..... It wasnt ready for last weeks episode
<badass_Derpy> epic movie was saxy

<TechRat> Hey, there's ponies alive in here!
<otakon> okay
<OrangeEliminator> fucking classic rock
<K3Seraph> Eh, I'll take electronica over dubstep
<Robo-Dale> ACT prepares you for SAT i believe
<Everlasting_Joy> It's harsh I don't get to dream of ponies, but if it spares me of nightmares like Epic Movie, it's a decent payoff.
<otakon> you said that already
<TechRat> bronystate is too fast for me.
<DSNesmith1> uh no
<K3Seraph> But I can dig some wubwubwub every now and again
<TopHat> WHAT IS LOVE
<Iweywrt> Epic movie was an epic fail
<TopHat> BABY DON'T HURT ME
<Dandelo> Classic rock and the blues bro
<TopHat> DON'T HURT ME
<DSNesmith1> ACT and SAT are two different tests
<nocturne> Vinyl appears to be having a siezure at her turntables, somepony should call her an ambulance.
<TopHat> NO MORE
<OrangeEliminator> hell yeah
<otakon> can we move on to the next part of the song?
<Dandelo> Das Essentials
<pony_7779> Act scores in 2-36, SATs have numbers like 1780 and 2400
<Robo-Dale> oh
<OrangeEliminator> ZZ TOP, DEEP PURPLE AND STEPPEN WOLF ALL DAY EVERY DAY
<pony_8127> I know the feeling TechRat
*kirzstryfe noms TopHat
<Robo-Dale> havent hit that part of high school yet so i have no idea :P
<Dandelo> I'd learn to play blues guitar if I wasn't lazy.
<Dr_Cheesums> get rid of it, please dubstep is my only weakness, apart from arrows to the knee.
<pony_7779> My neck is getting sore
<TechRat> We've replaced Vinyl with a giant bobblehead. Let's see if they notice.....
<OrangeEliminator> i play keys
<otakon> night Everlasting_Joy sleep well
<pony_7779> that headbob
<DSNesmith1> I've been having rather unpleasant dreams lately
*Midnight_Tempest noms on SuperBrony64
<Buytoast> hey Fenrir, I lied, the ACT was the one i didn't study for and did fine on
<Dandelo> And I could find the strings for my brother's guitar
<DSNesmith1> something about sharks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'm off to read, Goodnight everyone Bye~
<Thetrollside> The headbanging is to intense it lags the stream
<Buytoast> I don't recall the SAT
<TopHat> I'm tasty, aren't I?
<otakon> they're gone
<TheOhioBronyShow> Damn, Vinyl can bob her head FAST.
<Phase4> you are what you eat
<DSNesmith1> it didn't end well
<otakon> damn it!
<CosmicEevy> I have diarrhea
<CheshireKitten> Robo-Dale: No, PSAT is prep for SAT. ACT is another test entirely.
<not_a_cannibal> heh
<Tovler> how do those glasses stay on?
<Fenrir> same for my brother buytoast
<K3Seraph> Aerosmith and Queen
*Phase4 wears kirzstryfe
<OrangeEliminator> vinyl is a bobble head
<K3Seraph> MINE ARE BIGGER
<TOY_PON3> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Darf14> wow, its been a long time that I did the SAT test
<pony_7779> SAT is a lot harder than the ACT
<nocturne> Cancel that ambulance, it's a bobblehead.
<DSNesmith1> PSAT is easy, though
<Fenrir> he got drunk and had no sleep before hand and still scored above average
<OrangeEliminator> dep purple is bigger than dem guys
<TopHat> see how it feels
<Robo-Dale> yea thats one the prep one is named i couldnt think of it to save my life
<PonyBlade> HELLO!!
<TechRat> yeah, and it's a hundred times worse during the new episode pony_8127. Ugh.
<Buytoast> or at least, people said 27 was fine
<richfiles> I made my own Nukacola Quantum. Took it to the launch of Fallout New Vegas at the Gamestop where I work. Beautiful electric glowing liquid! :D

<DSNesmith1> depends on what college you want to get into
<Dandelo> Deep Purple, great band and one of the god fathers of metal.
<DSNesmith1> you should shoot for at least a 30
<otakon> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT sleep well
<K3Seraph> True
<Fenrir> I have to go to bed soon so that I have a good sleep for the test. I am so worried about bombing it
<OrangeEliminator> hell yeah negro
<Phase4> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT

<K3Seraph> But still...
<TOY_PON3> okay to be honest I didnt take the SAT because I'm not planning on going to a UC

<indeable> iiii
<pony_8127> Also, I just noticed I'm not signed in.
<Darf14> College Algebra is a B****!

<TheMaster> well the ASVAB isn't quite the same as SAT. but 97 is pretty good
<Fenrir> i already passed it last year, but my school didnt offer anything higher, so I am just taking it again to keep it fresh in my head
<CosmicEevy> I'm glad to know no one noticed my embarrassing statements
<ChaosPony> Hey guys, long time no see. Hows everypony?
<DSNesmith1> my SAT wasn't so hot
<Mines5> lol Analysis Connection
<Buytoast> I'd have to dig for the SAT.
<CheshireKitten> I got either 28 or 29, sommat like that. Had no trouble getting colleges to beg for me to go there with that. You do not need a 30 to compete. :p
<RAWRity> I go 2040: 680 in each Category
<otakon> pony_7779: I took SAT when it was 1600, I got a 1120
<OrangeEliminator> i noticed them
<Vinco> SAT 1760
<Quin> guyz i did it!
<K3Seraph> Well now that you mentioned them...
<PonyBlade> cause in Pinkie_Pie the party never stops
<TheMaster> 1300/1600 for me
<TheOhioBronyShow> Everytime the have a group hug, I just D'aww on the outside.
<OrangeEliminator> and screencapped them
<Dandelo> I didn't care to notice.
<Quin> im on mirc!
<CosmicEevy> ......shit
<OrangeEliminator> and printed them off
<Phase4> might as well leave until the mane ghat starts getting spammed
<Corwyn> Darn chat, always ruining cakes.
<pony_7779> 32 ACT
<GabeMoist> Don't remember
<otakon> my math sucked
<OrangeEliminator> and mailed them to your mom
<GabeMoist> was probably awful though
<Phase4> chat'
<PonyBlade> it just has nap breaks
<TheMaster> didn't pay attention to the essay because it didn't matter
<Fenrir> SAT, code for suck A** test
<TechRat> dawwwww
<DSNesmith1> I always ran out of time on the math bits
<Tovler> Is this song from Titan A.E.?
<K3Seraph> I want my "GO GO POWER RANGERS" moment from them
<DSNesmith1> no
<otakon> BUT ! My military aptitide test was 79/99
<K3Seraph> : (
<TechRat> that scene chokes me up every time
<RAWRity> 680 Writing, 680 Reading, 680 Math. I may not be in the top, but damn if I'm not consistent.
<Dandelo> Thy shalt not leave until I get Retsupurea
<GabeMoist> I got, like a 2 on the essay
<not_a_cannibal> What's Mirc?
<Darf14> Good at math, but my current Professor is harsh
<K3Seraph> Dragonshy came close
<DSNesmith1> lol RAWRity
<CosmicEevy> i dont really care she would just give me more pepto bismol
<K3Seraph> So very very close
<Dandelo> Or it turns to one oclock
<K3Seraph> But not quite
<TheMaster> wow rawrity. those are awesome scores
<Fenrir> consistancy is good
<DSNesmith1> I don't remember what my breakdown scores were at all
<OrangeEliminator> 1:44 in the morning
<OrangeEliminator> watching ponies
<CheshireKitten> I got a 1280 on the SAT, back when it only had two sections and that was considered a decent score. xD
<TheMaster> 690 reading / 610 math. Its why i'm a history major
<Mines5> they should play Titan A.E. for next movie night XD
<otakon> If I had taken Math before taking the SAT, I would have done better
<soldier> i do enjoy this song. it is quite nice.
<K3Seraph> What is 9 hours from now here...
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> they are
<CosmicEevy> its 00:48 here
<DSNesmith1> I'd rather have a hard prof than one who just doesn't care about teaching the class
<K3Seraph> 6am
<K3Seraph> 8|
<gmzamz> yay it works
<not_a_cannibal> is good song
<OrangeEliminator> cosmic you aint a real fan
<OrangeEliminator> maaaaan
<DSNesmith1> I go to a research uni so none of the profs want to teach
<RAWRity> one of my academic advisors actually said to me "That's some balanced fucking knowledge"
<TheOhioBronyShow> I wish I had friends....Um, I mean, I'M VERY SOCIAL!...confound these ponies
<K3Seraph> Well...buck.
<DSNesmith1> they just want to do their research
<ChaosPony> :P Hey guys!
<Dandelo> Oh hey, can I get colelctive thoughts on some pictures?
<OrangeEliminator> damn yous a poser
<CosmicEevy> Why?

<OrangeEliminator> YOU AINT GOT NUTTIN ON MY YO DOG
<TheMaster> that sucks DSN.
<OrangeEliminator> BRO FISITA
<DSNesmith1> which means you're boned if the book isn't good
<pony_7779> I kept getting high scores on just individual tests, getting canceled out by low scores on the other for the overall
<CheshireKitten> Could have retaken but would've needed to take the Writing section, I said screw that.
<CheshireKitten> :D
<OrangeEliminator> HOE DISSIN YAH
<TheMaster> good teachers can make or break how you do in a class
<pikorar> I'm in lesbians with you!
<CosmicEevy> Who?
<Darf14> true
<pikorar> What?
<CosmicEevy> I'm confused
<DSNesmith1> my E&M teacher is awfu
*Quin slaps not_a_cannibal around a bit with a large trout
<soldier> i may need to obtain it for my music collection.
<pikorar> It's a joke.
<DSNesmith1> he just throws equations on the board
<K3Seraph> Not just you then
<K3Seraph> o_o
<pikorar> From a movie.
<DSNesmith1> doesn't explain the physics at all
<Keatonn> Scott pilgrim ftw.
<CosmicEevy> I know
<Dr_Cheesums> ill tell someone who does have fans, Mr Breezey
<pikorar> Yes.
<TheMaster> anyone here a history major?
<CosmicEevy> I fuckin love
<DSNesmith1> and I got the wrong textbook version
<Fenrir> i hate it when teachers do that

<K3Seraph> Yo soy no comprendo!
<TheOhioBronyShow> Scott Pilgrim pwns.
<K3Seraph> D8
<Keatonn> yey
<pikorar> They should play it one Ronystat.
<CosmicEevy> but im confused by the rest of the conversation
<BlayzeKohime> Maybe it's just a smushed cake
<RAWRity> I'm going to a tech college so I essentially teach myself for the most part. Teachers are just there when you fuck up the computers.
<Robo-Dale> im homeschooled and i have a retired science teacher whos real awesome i can go to for help on my stuff :P

<not_a_cannibal> yessir ilold
<RAWRity> I opted to take Honors Junior English instead of AP. Holy Fuck was that class boring.
<K3Seraph> It's getting bigger...or closer...or something
<TheMaster> when i'm a high school history teacher I will do it right
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> she needs a return
<Dan_MoCa> Classic song never gets old

<pony_7779> This song is simply the best. Never before have I heard such sweet tunes from anyone besides Rebecca Black. In fact, she was my idol when I was 4, she saved my life when I was deep in depression. Throughout my life I cannot help but pause and give homage to this great turn in music history. May the name of Rebecca Black forever be remembered along with the names of Bach, Debussy, and the Beatles.

<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer, why I could simply die for a spot of tea, thank you my good man
<RAWRity> emangamer: I dare say, what seems to have your knickers in a twist and your sensibilites all in a kerfuffle?

<Equineexcite> I'll try
<Quin> everytime mario fingerwaved i was like "don't disrespect"
<Equineexcite> I wanna watch this
<Evdog_> *rising atonal music*
<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer:I say old chap, this stream is simlpy riveting
<Tovler> When does Lady Bow show up?
<Evdog_> *silence*
<Equineexcite> She's near the end of the game
<Iweywrt> chapter 3 i think
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Lol, any Mod that stays up all night is going to regret it tomorrow >_<
<TechRat> wow....Lady Bow is a ways in.
<Quin> Way later Tovler
<DongleKumquat> *SUPRISEBUTTSECKS* *MOLESTIA*
<Evdog_> Title: PAPER MARIO (only in theatres)
<Quin> she is like 4th companion
<emangamer> RAWRity: Quite, but I simply wish to reserve the old fashions and tributes.
<Darf14> not until chapter 3
*emangamer dons his monocle
<noteworthy> i'd pay for it
<Evdog_> (and piratebay)
<Equineexcite> Her attack pattern hurt my fingers
<DB_Brony> Goombas: "I never asked to be a art of this!"
*LunaTheBeloved gets her pocket watch and cane out
<TOY_PON3> emangamer = The Big Cheese?
<OrangeEliminator> so, is this the streamer playing, or is this a lets play?
<Midnight_Tempest> needs moar explosions
<RAWRity> emangamer: can't keep on dwelling in the past my boy, only leads to being and antique in your later years.
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: <insert picture of nigel thronberry> I SAY...is this what westernes think of us?
<djdashie> buck
<noteworthy> or pirate it i guess
<Iweywrt> its streamer
<OrangeEliminator> cool
<Tovler> hurry up. Lady Bow is the best thing ever and everyone here needs to see her.
<Wolfy> I got work tomorrow.. BAH! WORK BE DAMNED! I"M STAYING UP ALL NIGHT!
<Iweywrt> Though its in dire need of commentary
<Evdog_> XD
<OrangeEliminator> as much as i like mario, i dont just wanna watch you play it all night
<OrangeEliminator> :|
<Darf14> Theres usually a back screen when transisioning from one area to the next, I wonder why its jumps to the next screen immediately
<Colt_Magnum> Oh Mollestia..you and your fillygraping ways.
<GabeMoist> No
<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer: I am appaled at the very though of such injustices to us!
<LunaTheBeloved> *appalled
<emangamer> RAWRity: But, then good sir, do you attribute this new fangles "steam punk" fashion going around this so called interwebs?
<Equineexcite> cute goombas
<DB_Brony> Iwewrt: we are the commentary
<DongleKumquat> mkay ill write the screenplay
<emangamer> RAWRity: What* my most sincere appologies
<DB_Brony> only with text
<Iweywrt> Once you get back to town how about we do more requests?
<Colt_Magnum> Twilight's parents probably knew what Celestia was doing to their daughter but didnt say anything because it would mean Twilight's future would be ruined.
*TOY_PON3 puts on top hat
<Quin> rapping
<TOY_PON3> Now I'm fancy quite
<noteworthy> micheal bay directs and every two seconds there must be an explosion
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: What What. I say we go and teach those westerns what for. Are you up for a round of fisty cuffs
*emangamer removes the top hat from TOY_PON3
<DongleKumquat> AH brilliant idea for a fanfic
*TOY_PON3 smacks emangamer's hand with white glove
<emangamer> Such a fashionable hat does not belong on a WHELP such as you
<Equineexcite> With how fast the streamer's going through text, we'll at least make it to the first dungeon
*Midnight_Tempest becomes a top hat
*Phase4 wears Midnight_Tempest
<DongleKumquat> except that would never be succesful in the general community
<Quin> i say i believe we have a duel on our hands
<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer:I do say though, I am rather tired. I think I will, oh how is it the westerneres say it, "Hit, the hay".
*Phase4 now feels classy
<emangamer> TOY_PON3: Do not try your hand at things you do not wholy appreciate..."good SIR"
<Colt_Magnum> Then years later repressed feelings would finally well up in Twilight as her friends worry and question the things theyve seen done to her by the princess.
*Midnight_Tempest eats Phase4's brain
<LunaTheBeloved> *westerners
<Phase4> ._.
<RAWRity> emangamer: Ah yes, that old codswollop. I'm afriad that while the notion had a bit of merrit, most of the artisans seem to abide by the delusion that simply throwing gears and switches around higgeldy-piggeldy, that they can somehow capture a feeling of grandness.
<Phase4> gnight LunaTheBeloved
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: Perhaps you shouldn't hit the hay, maybe you should just partake a nap upon it?
<Evdog_> Make sure that you don't give Mario any lines. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpLXo55yfw
<Colt_Magnum> No Twilight, thats not just a game you and the princess like to play!
<OrangeEliminator> how long till mario is done
*Phase4 will be awake untill the episode
<otakon> sleep well LunaTheBeloved
<TechRat> Cheerio, LunaTheBeloved!
<Phase4> its 17:37 here
<emangamer> RAWRity: Higgeldy-Piggeldy? Since when did you partake of such slanguage?
<LunaTheBeloved> I think I shall
<otakon> suddenly
<Quin> wtf was that?
<Iweywrt> lol what?
<LunaTheBeloved> Goodnight everypony
<GabeMoist> voices?
<Iweywrt> yay
<TOY_PON3> later LunaTheBeloved
<GabeMoist> in MY head?
*LunaTheBeloved hugs everypony goodnight
<Tovler> SB64 had a MIC and wasn't using it?
<Midnight_Tempest> lol i heard egoraptor in the background
<otakon> night dear
<emangamer> RAWRity: social language* (slang)
<Dr_Cheesums> did anyone hear talking in the background?
<otakon> Tovler: nah, it's from a pony inspired video
<DB_Brony> lol at awesome reach
<Iweywrt> lol
<Novarak> DUDE SO
<Quin> dude so
<Tovler> oh nvmd
<emangamer> that my good sir, is what one would call a portmanteau....
<Dr_Cheesums> yea...
<Novarak> ARE YOU READY
<DongleKumquat> SO DUDE
<Colt_Magnum> whoah ya
<Novarak> FOR HALO REACCHHHHH
<Colt_Magnum> around
<RAWRity> emangamer: why, since I was a lad! I spent many a summer's evening perusing through the grand novels of Robert Stroud and the like, and I dare say i enjoyed picking up my fare share of the common tongue.
<Iweywrt> I think im so tired im hearing voices
<noteworthy> i just recall the horrible mario movie from like the 90s
<Colt_Magnum> :D
<Darf14> Either awesome Reach or the altered Brony version of that flash
*DB_Brony hugs LunaTheBeloved goodnight
<Evdog_> XD
<DongleKumquat> i recall hotel mario
<TOY_PON3> emangamer: I take it you mistake me for some country folk am I correct?
<Colt_Magnum> Halo may have Reach, but Mass effect has flexibility
<pony_7770> eats popcorn
<DB_Brony> the brony version is awesome (not trying to be redundant)
<noteworthy> never seen hotel mario. curious...
<Colt_Magnum> that was a joke.
<emangamer> RAWRity: Your father would be appaled at you. Talking and dressing like a sheer commmoner like TOY_PON3. You are the kind of person that shall reduce this country to the dark age once agiain.
<emangamer> again*
<TechRat> @pony_7770 there's only tea and scones in here
*Midnight_Tempest merges with the Internet 'I am INTERFACE!'
<RainyRag> ARRRRRRG! NEED CAFFEINE TO FINISH MY DRAWING!
<Wolfy> 0-0*
<Darf14> Super Goomba Bros!
<noteworthy> hmm. it might of been...drats.
<Wolfy> red vs. Blue!
*TOY_PON3 gasps
<Equineexcite> Wuh oh
<pony_7770> wait, no horderves?
<Wolfy> first thing to come to my mind
<Evdog_> noteworthy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmVeZEB-Qmg
*emangamer hands RainyRag a cup of exqusite tea
<RawketLawnchair> Red Oni, Blue Oni.
<Equineexcite> there was a trick to this one I think
<TechRat> Will you take the red goomba, or the blue goomba?
<Robo-Dale> its simmons and caboose :D
<TOY_PON3> emangamer: how absurd I...I...>.>
<Robo-Dale> as goombas
<emangamer> That, indeed, one damage.
<RainyRag> No thanks, I take all my caffeine in pill form
<Evdog_> Probably the only good part of that movie.
<noteworthy> omg this scene
<RAWRity> emangamer: Bah, my father has as much respectability about him as a common tramp. He carries nothign in his pocket but lint and what pitty pettance he has for his next opium dose. The man had less to do with raising me than Attila the Hun.
<emangamer> Oh look dear chaps, I have reduced the streat urchen to tears HOHOHO
<noteworthy> HE"S GOT A BOB-OMB!
<Dashie2> Who the fuck
<Dashie2> stole my nickname?
<blake> Dashi did
<DongleKumquat> OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS
<BlayzeKohime> Whoever designed this game was on shrooms
<Dashie2> ahhh hell no
<DongleKumquat> IVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE
<Phase4> dashie: hello there
<RAWRity> emangamer: pah. A true gentlemen does not resort to belittling others like it is common sport!
<Darf14> heart box time
<emangamer> RAWRity: But I dare say that Atilla the Hun was a rather remakable and ingenious commander.
<OrangeEliminator> HOT DAMN

<OrangeEliminator> HITTING THIS BLOCK
<FlutterPony> pumped

<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:D
<emangamer> RAWRity: "Screw the rules?"
<Iweywrt> Watch your caps rage there buddy :P
<RAWRity> You should be ashamed of your actions. For it is not what a man comes from that is important, but rather what he does with his life.
<blake> "Screw the rules, I have money", I believe
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol allcaps
<noteworthy> i remember yoshi was in it, i think, and he was literally a lizard, i believe

<Quin> did Simon pick epic movie?
<noteworthy> it should of been what every kid dreamed about, instead, it was just...terrible
<emangamer> I dare say RAWRity, do you consider it ok to reduce OrangeEliminator to nothing more than a smoldering pile of a boot print for his excessive shouting?
<Phase4> Quin: yup
<EmperorJewel> Did the movie end alreadu?
<Simon> sadly, yes

<emangamer> Phase4: I dare say that Phase4 has lost the ways of the PROPER english language, as it compares to the common filthy language that TOY_PON3 and OrangeEliminator speak.
<Darf14> I remember trying to see if it was possible to catch one of those stars
<OrangeEliminator> sim Hey. Hey. Look at all the fucks I giv- oh wait I cant find any
<EmperorJewel> Please?
<dashy9> i love that song
<Equineexcite> save up for the good ones
<Phase4> emangamer: Perhaps you are right good fellow.
<emangamer> Oh my lads, look that the misuse of the tab button that OrangeEliminator had done.
<emangamer> Phase4: Quite *dons his top hat*
<TOY_PON3> emangamer: welll sorry if ceslestia didnt give me a fully function brain
<SlurryMoon> 3lol this emulator thing is distracting me from Peach

<OrangeEliminator> emangamer: if you where any more elitest, yuo would be jewish Royalty that also likes partaking in the occasional genocide while you sip Starbucks coffe and read obnoxious blogs on your iMacPro, while wearing a 100 thousand dollar suit
<Iweywrt> Needs more yay
<riverhippo2> what game is this
<emangamer> TOY_PON3: I dont think that Celestia has a bit of anything to do with it. I think it pure inbread genetics that has done that ot you.

<pony_7770> Where's Luigi's chin?
<emangamer> OrangeEliminator: That would imply that I am, oh what do those westerners and their confounded language call it?, a hippyster I suppose?
<Simon> so much "yay"
<Dr_Cheesums> yay
<Phase4> EmperorJewel: you still here?
<Darf14> I like Luigi more than Mario
<XaviortheSavior> hi guys. ooh paper mario
<emangamer> Phase4: I dare say that you have earned that top hat that you have so cleverly adorned.
<Corwyn> I thought luigi was going to try to stomp on the goomba there.
<Corwyn> Out of reflex.
<Mike-393> what time does MLP start?
<Randomnerd> Perhaps?
<OrangeEliminator> emangamer: cant tell if homeschooled and shelted by parents and knows nothing about society, or a trying too hard and getting nowhere troll

<Simon> my brother is watching fresh meat, I lol'd
<Marx> Kinda hard to leave this awesome playthrough, but I wanna get up to ponies, so...
<emangamer> OrangeEliminator: I believe you are simply outside of the circle as to where my language patter comes from.
<Darf14> You have to go to the star road first
<Quin> i think emangamer is trolling quite elegantly
<pony_7770> it's that dang spinning roof messing things up
<Marx> Anyway, later.
<Mike-393> kk? what is 9central?
<JumpingJoysticks> What the fuck is this?
<OrangeEliminator> emangamer: and that is?
<Equineexcite> You gotta talk to someone I think
<Simon> fake and gay

<noteworthy> i think merlon is out...
<Phase4> emangamer, the sophisticated troll
<Simon> fyi, gay = happy
<emangamer> TOY_PON3: I am TRYING to say that your parents simply found the closest person of the opposite gender, their cousin or sister perhaps, and mated with them.
<Phase4> ^
<Yoshi> so much lag O.O
<Quin> hahaha
<Corwyn> 9:00 am central time zone
<OrangeEliminator> reading a thesaurus for words no one cares about while you type =/= sophistication

<Midnight_Tempest> being a hipster is so mainstream SuperBrony64
<Phase4> ok, currently i'm leaching of my neighbours internet, so i'm going to stop the stream. shouldnt use to much bandwidth
<Dr_Cheesums> who here rages when they play super meatboy?

<TopHat> I died again
<Buytoast> My soul has been utterly crushed; life is but a twisted mockery of existance to me now.
<Buytoast> The horror.
<emangamer> I believe that I might be taking my wealth and affluence too far, but I am simply too lazy to find a single care with which to give.
<Quin> ello tophat
<noteworthy> when i got majoras mask, i was too scared to go into any dungeons, so i just stayed in clock town

<TopHat> why?
<emangamer> I do believe that I may, as the westerns might say, hit the hay. Although I am rather certain that I would never result to physical confrontments with inanimate objects.

<Yoshi> and how bout that 1999 mode
<emangamer> Do try to use your words and do not resolve to using primative symbols
<OrangeEliminator> Talking to emangamer is interesting. although he types like an upperclass cool cat, her has the personality of a child. it is a truly strange mix
<Quin> idk
<RawketLawnchair> Her?
<Quin> i kinda want to stay up all night

<Dr_Cheesums> USA CABLE ENTERTAINMENT.
<Yoshi> you don't happen to live in houston do you
<Buytoast> USA: Where the language is American and God is the only man trusted with the country's safe-keeping.

<Buytoast> So much talk.
<Darf14> I wonder if Lyra can see us?
<Quin> i know she has that
<emangamer> it is simply habberdashery.

*TOY_PON3 has a feeling Lyra is a guy
<Dr_Cheesums> lets cheer things up with pinkie, now where is she?

<TopHat> she has the design of a femal
<TopHat> e

<emangamer> TOY_PON3: I do have the percise feeling sometimes as well
<Buytoast> That usually differentiates the males from the females, right?
<Yoshi> pinky <3
<TopHat> and the eyelashes
<emangamer> TopHat: we are not speaking about the Chacter, we are referring to the IRC chatter.
<Yoshi> err... pinkie*
*Sumica shrugs 'was a guy with gender issues when I first meet him might have corected it by now'
<TopHat> oh

Also i am UPPERCLASS GUIS"

<RawketLawnchair> Yay?
<SlurryMoon> 3hey... don't spam please

<Yoshi> trixie is lovably cocky
<TopHat> thats what the @ means
<derpy_pony> no man smokes menthol
<TOY_PON3> SuperBrony64: Some people obviously don't know how to behave themselves in this chat. Quite foolish really.
<TopHat> and the coloured text
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai everypony :3

<hyreia> Or are we all talking in the #bronystate channel?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I'm glad for those who know how to behave themselve ;)
<Bane_Kai> right now I am playing TF2 mostly.... Trying to stay up all night

<noteworthy> oh yeah new episode
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^__^
<pony_362> um...
<KetaminaDianePie> yaaay~
<SuperQuin> god i love poniez
<pony_6734> :P what movie is this?
<EmperorJewel> I do too.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<hyreia> This is why Brony State is good: pony marathons are good but dang, it's a lot of pony.
<JamesIsABrony> been chatting for about 2 hours. LIKE A BOSS
<noteworthy> monk tv show
<pony_362> you people need to get your mind of the gutter a bit
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's why I'm here ^_^
<EmperorJewel> I wish it was 7 hours in the future
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<SuperQuin> and im glad to finally have joined the herd
<derpy_pony> lol
<pony_6734> thank you
<EmperorJewel> So then. What are we watching now?
<Corwyn> That's damned specific
<EmperorJewel> Good for you Quin
<noteworthy> new episode discussion?
<EmperorJewel> I am glad I joined the herd when I did
<SuperQuin> i have liked ponies for a while, but just recently i got into the hardcore stuff
<Buytoast> Wow
<Yoshi> my mind can be where it wants to
<JamesIsABrony> Playing xbox360 and chatting at same time. like a baws
<Iweywrt> I sometimes cant belieave that ponys are more manly then vampires now.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai Randomnerd :3
<EmperorJewel> Funny enough ponies made me immune to fore
<EmperorJewel> gore
<KetaminaDianePie> yeah...... but cartoons or something else next?
<SuperQuin> o.O
<derpy_pony> vampires?
<dashy9> I hope poor AJ doesn't get overshadowed again
<SuperQuin> elaborate
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I like poniez :3
<Dr_Cheesums> bronies are magical unicorns
<Iweywrt> Like the movie twilight
<EmperorJewel> Reading Cupcakes make it so everything else is so pathetic
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<derpy_pony> I heard they sparkle in sunlight
<JamesIsABrony> ponies are the best thing ever made ever
<Lake> twilight has no plot
<EmperorJewel> And the sequal..
<pony_362> who all day spread love and tolerance all over haters
<dashy9> I'd rather be a pegasus pony
<hyreia> Or anything. Vampires have been romanticized and turned into a teenage thing.
<SuperQuin> im too scared to read that
<Iweywrt> Is mlp or twilight more manly?
<EmperorJewel> I forget the name. Something like... um.. I forget.
<pony_362> unicorn
<derpy_pony> Sold the book a few dozen times...but never read it
<Yoshi> unicorn master-race here
<EmperorJewel> But it had Rarity. And removing a univorns horn is wrose.
<KetaminaDianePie> ur sick Iweywrt
<hyreia> Compare: Twilight Sparkle vs. sparkling in Twilight.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai!
<EmperorJewel> I read it for... well... I wanted to know about it.
<TopHat> Cupcakes didn't bug me, but I think I'm a sociopath
<Iweywrt> lol
<hyreia> Hi!
<EmperorJewel> Probably.
<SuperQuin> *shudder*
<Iweywrt> So true
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Most everypony talks in #BronyState ^_^
<pony_362> the high class
<Anthony> is is strange that ive been watching these livestreams more than my own cable?
<noteworthy> personally, applejack''s one liners always kill me. i don't see why so many don't enjoy her...
<pony_362> LIKE A BAWSS
<Iweywrt> No
<EmperorJewel> But while I didn't get freaked out. I can now watch something really goring and feel fine.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02How is everypony doing?
<SuperQuin> just knowing what it is scares the shit outa me
<Dr_Cheesums> i used to want to be a pegesus, but now i want to be a unicorn because of a fan fic i read. oh fuck i never thought i would ever say that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You enjoying the stream?
<JamesIsABrony> I would rather be a unicorn who is so madvanced in the power of magic that I can change into other pony- like- creatures
<derpy_pony> your cable doesn't come with integrated chatroom
<Yoshi> hello superbrony
<dashy9> i'm doing great
<JamesIsABrony> Im fine, how about yourself
<Anthony> true
<OhItsFluttershy> Is the sound out of sink all across or just on my screen?
<pony_362> no on hates her. Her popularity is just mere
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I like being a pegasus ^_^
<OhItsFluttershy> *sync
<SuperQuin> do u think ill be less scared if i read it?
<Sumica> 00,10My cable only has one use any more
<EmperorJewel> True.
<Corwyn> it's off too.
<SuperQuin> or will i be scarred for life?
<JamesIsABrony> you are just a boss, bro
<EmperorJewel> But I knew the plot before i read it.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02WOAH
<dashy9> I like AJ's voice
<derpy_pony> it's laggy and very quiet here
<hyreia> I tried to read Twilight because I believe in giving things a fair chance (like MLP), I couldn't get past chapter 4. It was boring and had the equivalent of female spaghetti (if you're aware of the awkward spaghetti joke)
<EmperorJewel> Welll.... Sort of both.
<hyreia> That makes sense.
<TheGreatSako> If you think you can handle gore then boy, do I have some manga to show you.
<derpy_pony> but in synch
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Cupcakes talk is forbidden and subject to ban O___O
<OhItsFluttershy> Also, Monk? Odd choice. Not bad, just od!
<EmperorJewel> If you know the plot isn't too bad.
<OhItsFluttershy> *odd
<Yoshi> superbrony, are you the one incharge of the stream?
<EmperorJewel> Oh is it?
<EmperorJewel> Sorry.
<Anthony> i like monk
<OhItsFluttershy> God I can't type tonight
<SuperBrony64> 10,02PG13 Chat please
<EmperorJewel> I will not now.
<Iweywrt> I was so suprised to find out that mlp was actually a good show.
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh Monk is odd
<TheGreatSako> Aww.
<EmperorJewel> I will stop now
<Dr_Cheesums> applejack is my least favorite of the mane six, i dont hate her or anything
<SuperQuin> lol i knew that :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's alright, I still wub woo all ^_^
<SuperQuin> YAY!
<EmperorJewel> I wub woo Super Brony
<SlurryMoon> 3Monk is also the greatest! :3
<OhItsFluttershy> It's a good show, I'm just used to coming in and seeing anime! :p
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<derpy_pony> same here, Iweywrt
<TopHat> :)
<EmperorJewel> But not you Quin
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<JamesIsABrony> she will be the MANE charecter in the new episode
<SuperQuin> :'o
<Anthony> time for a change
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Love and tolerate ^_^
<Dr_Cheesums> i know
<JamesIsABrony> get it.. MANE...
<EmperorJewel> I only love quin
<Yoshi> sad that the papermario stream glitched out ;_;

<noteworthy> i know they don't hate her, but it seems too many dismiss her
<EmperorJewel> not wub
<SuperBrony64> 10,02ORSOHELPMEILLTURNTHISCARAROUND

<SuperBrony64> 10,02SlurryMoon is a silly filly like Monk :3
<derpy_pony> I lost the plotline...what is he doing there?
<EmperorJewel> But again. What are we watching right now super brony?
<Buytoast> lol
<JamesIsABrony> hense MANE charecter
<OhItsFluttershy> Francis Ford Coppala? Not sure if that's a huge get this day and age :D
<hyreia> Watched first episode, obligated to finish the two parter. Watched the 3rd episode to see what was next... then had to watch the 4th. : ) You all know what happens after that.

<Wolfy> woooow
<KetaminaDianePie> yaaaaay~

<TheGreatSako> Uh, uh . . .monk!(?)
<EmperorJewel> It is clearly some TV series. But I don't know it.
<Iweywrt> lol
<iLeikcupturds> Cant wait for the new ep.
<OhItsFluttershy> hahahahah
*Phase4 loves this show
<Wolfy> monk, how dare you tell fluttershy to be quiet!

<EmperorJewel> Oh MOnk. Thank you Great Sako!
<Iweywrt> yay "oh shut up"
<Yoshi> lol, yay was appropriatly timed
<SlurryMoon> 3Sharona is so annoyed!
<KetaminaDianePie> HEEY!
<derpy_pony> I knew in episode 2 that I would watch them all
<derpy_pony> after the manticore scene
<SuperQuin> guys do you think 1000 years was harsh?
<TopHat> I think SuperBrony64 might be my favorite mod
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<JamesIsABrony> MANE charecter
<TopHat> no
<iLeikcupturds> GONA B AWF DA CHAYN LYK RAINBOWZ MAYN
<OhItsFluttershy> for me it was such a surprise
<EmperorJewel> So far I would agree with you.
<derpy_pony> didn't regret it
<EmperorJewel> Then agian... there was one called Luna
<SuperQuin> me too ^_^
<OhItsFluttershy> I watched the first episode half rolling my eyes
<EmperorJewel> And Luna is awesome
<JamesIsABrony> YEA BOEEY
<Yoshi> indeed it is
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm your favorite Mod? :O
<SuperQuin> yeah luna is awesome
<Corwyn> alright, what's mips.tv and why's it keep showing adverts?
<OhItsFluttershy> Then I figured I'd just finish the story and watch the next one
<Dr_Cheesums> i find this weird but i wish i live in equestria as a unicorn. Anyone else wish what i wish?
<TopHat> yes
<Lagmobile> I watched the first 5 rolling my eyes
<OhItsFluttershy> Then I figured, hey, what's one more
<Anthony> aww
<EmperorJewel> Superbrony are you awesome?
<SuperQuin> once i had to spend 3 days alone in the woods
<Iweywrt> It started off girly but it did get way better.
<OhItsFluttershy> Then another. Then another.
<SuperQuin> it was horrible
<JamesIsABrony> everyone ever wishes that, bro
<OhItsFluttershy> And now here I am
<hyreia> Twilight Sparkle's lonely, friendless life and how out of place she seemed in the MLP universe really drew me in.
<SuperQuin> i cant imagine 1000 years on the moon
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I think I'm awesome...that all depends on what everypony thinks about me D:
<KetaminaDianePie> :'( monk
<derpy_pony> install adblock plus, Corwyn
*SuperBrony64 hugs TopHat
<JamesIsABrony> your not alone *brohoof*
<Lagmobile> but it was the summer and i had nothing else to do so i kept watching
<EmperorJewel> OK then. Youare now my favourite mod
<OhItsFluttershy> hyreia: Agreed!
<TopHat> :)
<Iweywrt> lol I ended up watching the entire first season in 1 night
<SuperQuin> SuperBrony what do u think?
<derpy_pony> everyone should have this plugin anyeay, Colt_Magnum
<dashy9> I would love to control the weather
<TheGreatSako> So if I think that you have the ability to make toast out of thin air, can you?
<Yoshi> poor monk...
<Dr_Cheesums> Hehe, my second ever legit brohoof
<SuperQuin> 1000 years too harsh?
<derpy_pony> everyone should have this plugin anyeay, Corwyn
<derpy_pony> so
<EmperorJewel> You are Super.
<CroissantOfNinja> I definitely remember thinking "why the *yay* am i watching this?!"
<OhItsFluttershy> Iweywrt: I did something similar :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thanks ^_^ It means a lot
<Anthony> i wish i was a pegasaus
<hyreia> My friend said the moment Spike smacked the floor in episode 1 he knew he liked it.
<JamesIsABrony> there will be many more where that came from, my freind
<derpy_pony> sry
<SlurryMoon> 3Poor Monk... :<
<Yoshi> I'm suprised he allows all that paper to be strewn across his desk
<SuperQuin> O_O answer the question
<EmperorJewel> Now! Um... Make me feel special by saying my name is Jewel
<derpy_pony> monk woman
<pony_362> you know what? screw unicorns I want to be pegasus
<Iweywrt> Its funny becuase when I watched the entire 1st season in 1 sitting I stated hallucinating ponies everywhere o_0
<OhItsFluttershy> So Nun then?
<Dr_Cheesums> ive been a brony ever since season 2 ep 2 and ive only ever had 2 brohoofs
<GabeMoist> Is there a Monk pony?
<SuperQuin> no he must answer the question first
<JamesIsABrony> nope..nope the fantasy is not real. he would have attacked her hair.
<EmperorJewel> No@
<EmperorJewel> !
<Corwyn> I think so.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Which question?
<SuperQuin> >:O
<Anthony> lol
<pony_362> cos I want to fly
<Yoshi> ive watched around ep 9 I think
<hyreia> Iweyrt: lol. There's never such thing as too much pony, but a mind can only take so much at once.
<OhItsFluttershy> ...right now
<EmperorJewel> The one about my name being Jewel
<SuperQuin> was 1000 years too harsh a punishment
<Iweywrt> lol
<JamesIsABrony> well, just keep on keeping on, and you will get many many brohoofs,
<Anthony> i wanna fly too. i wanna go fast
<SuperQuin> for luna?
<Dr_Cheesums> moar please
<pony_362> I HATE ADS
<richfiles> I am multitask. Skyrim, Fringe, Monk (barely) and pony chat! :)
<Corwyn> Bah
<hyreia> That's great, you hallucinated.
<Dr_Cheesums> ikr
<dashy9> I became a brony as soon as I heard Art of the Dress
<Corwyn> Now I want second half of episode.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah...but Luna is back so it's all better ^_^
<Yoshi> curious, how old are most people?
<JamesIsABrony> BOOM!
<richfiles> Duck!
<dashy9> lol unfitting music
<derpy_pony> three or four days after I watched the show the second pony war on /b/ started...it was fun...17 bans in 4 hours
<Corwyn> yay
<Dr_Cheesums> 14...
<Phase4> damnit, seen this one
<Yoshi> 18
<Anthony> i became a brony after the sonic rainboom
<KetaminaDianePie> soo actual......
<JamesIsABrony> see wat i did there
<noteworthy> 18
<EmperorJewel> The point is if it was for the best.
<dashy9> 16 myself
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I think so
<SuperQuin> u sir are the embodiment of pony
<JamesIsABrony> 13. winner
<KetaminaDianePie> next is something else?
<Dashie2> Relogging!
<SuperQuin> i wub woo
<TopHat> Man I love Journey
<Dr_Cheesums> i turn 14 in 2 months
<Iweywrt> I hallucinated that rainbow dash was in my room and we had a conversation... I thought it was a dream....
<Dashie2> dashie logged out, i get my name back
<EmperorJewel> Maybe delaying her age for 1000 years is best.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02She wasn't being very nice and even when she got back she still wasn't nice
<Dr_Cheesums> 15*
<EmperorJewel> Now say my name is jewel!
<pony_362> 13
<Dr_Cheesums> not 14
<noteworthy> oh gawd i feel old now
<Anthony> im 17
<Dashie> Hellz yeah
<Yoshi> not gonna lie, for the most part, I don't like "bronies" who are under the age of 16, but you guys seem ok
<KetaminaDianePie> yaaay~
<SuperQuin> i like to think she had a spell so she could sleep for 1000 years
<Iweywrt> Congrats on getting your name back
<Dashie> love you guise
<SuperQuin> otherwise she would have gone mad
<OhItsFluttershy> It's a slippery slope, them ponies. Your watching them, then posting as Fluttershy on AV Club.com, then making PMVs, then doing pony RP on twitter!
<Anthony> 18 in july
<Yoshi> lol, note I'm 18 too, so youre not alone
<SuperQuin> and thats why she was still bad
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm okay? :O
