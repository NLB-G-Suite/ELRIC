<Spade-Magnes> Huh...Gilda is the same voice actor as Spitefire
<AgentKalim> not son of Sparda
<hen3ry> sleep in closet. metaphor?
<Ray> 02You never remember me about your shows anymore
<Kandarihu> How about Spike making domino cities in Twilight Sparkle's library?
<MaidSurge> Aww Clerks? I can't watch it all. I'm going out with my friends!

<Pinkies4thWall|AFK> SuperBrony64: Rythym heaven fever is pissing me off
<Kandarihu> ...or were they matchsticks?
<Custard> Is it supposed to be black and white?
<AgentKalim> Yes
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's shoestring budget is part of the reason it was shot in black and white. A number of different types of lighting were used, and this would have required a lot of post production to resolve issues related to the varying color temperatures. With black and white, this isn't a problem.
<Bronysith> I WANT THAT DOG
<TOY_PON3> Was this movie made in the 30s? D:
<Spade-Magnes> Says Tabitha was Wendy O Koopa from the mario bros cartoon
<AgentKalim> Pinkie Pie swear
<Apple_Bloom> throws popcorn in mouth
<Freefall29> this movie is very, very low budget. around 22,000 dollars
<CECtheRonin> Hahaha.
<Custard> Ze Puppeh

<Bronysith> MaidSurge: i mean teh smurfs in space movie

<sergio_scriptor> this is TERrIBLE
<TOY_PON3> so much...lag
<Scavender> Well, my screen says: "Friday movie night:21hours, 5 minutes ago."
<TOY_PON3> Freefall29: There was no Dragon Ball live action film
<Freefall29> live action was the first and most crucial mistake. it was friggin live action
<MaidSurge> Bronysith: That's a pretty meh movie too
<devildog> has anyone seen avengers yet
<Bronysith> devildog: me
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Clerks is loosely based on "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri hence the name. Also, there are nine breaks in the movie to represent the nine rings of hell.
<Bronysith> devildog: iron man is best avenger
<SaxyPretender> 0,14me, twice
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: iron man or thor? or whos your fac?

<Freefall29> yes Custard

<sagas> This parts pretty funny
<Custard> Thannks
<sergio_scriptor> Silverscreen: a divine comedy movie would be alot better then this crap :|
<AgentKalim> The hell is this?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "smoker's lung" that the Chewlie's Gum rep slams on the counter is actually a calf's liver thrown in dirt and burned with cigarettes.
<TOY_PON3> Dante's Inferno was awesome. The film and the game too I guess
<sagas> The acting is so horrible except for the main characters :D
<Apple_Bloom> noms on popcorn
<Bronysith> AgentKalim: clerks. the movie that is far superior to James camerons avatar

<sergio_scriptor> GUM
<Freefall29> Bronysith: why exactly did you have to bring up avatar during this movie. just wondering
<AgentKalim> I know, but... well I guess this is what I get for watching a movie completely blind.
<MaidSurge> Well be back later guys, I'm off. See you after the movies/tomorrow! :)
<Bronysith> Freefall29: cause that movie blows
<sagas> This seems like an indie film :D

<AgentKalim> Why the hell are Jay and Silent Bob in this movie
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> woo Silent Bob
<diddutz> let's count this time
<Kandarihu> Well, an indie comedy movie vs the ultimate big-budget blockbusters. What could these two movies have in common?
<xmasskills> OH YEA
<Apple_Bloom> O_O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nah sorry, 1 hour 39 min
<Spade-Magnes> Swearing!
<AgentKalim> dafuq am I watching
<Dken2021> oh we aren't watching Haw Jones?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This is the first film in Kevin Smith's intricately interconnected View Askewniverse series (the others being Dogma, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks II). The movies are all linked by characters, themes and events and each contains numerous references to the others.
<ACS13123> seems legit
<kempa> fuck this fuck that
<sagas> I never get the point of the two guy standing outside
<kempa> :D
<TOY_PON3> SuperBrony64: Way to scare the shit out of them :D

<Freefall29> what a shame the budget couldent go into writing
<Custard> How long is this movie?
<Apple_Bloom> so much bad words..O_O
<Kakumy> Gangsters don't even say fuck that much...
<JESmith71> Bronysith, do you think Disney is dumb for making an Avatar Land at Disney World then? Espically since it won't open until 2016, will people even still be talking about Avatar then?
<Blaze> ....Am I supposed to hate those two? Because I do.
<sergio_scriptor> we will fu** anything ? even a lyra plushie ? :|
<sagas> There is a Clerks II? Is it any good?
<Spade-Magnes> Who the shit picked this?

<CECtheRonin> sagas I liked it, but there are some that don't.
<kempa> Hi Biglaw!
<Kandarihu> Well, there are two sequels to Avatar in the making.
<Blaze> ....Is this a PSA?
<Bronysith> JESmith71: that movie is terrible. idk if people will keep bringin it up
<Kandarihu> It's going to be a trilogy.
<AgentKalim> It looks like that.
<Kakumy> bye guys this movie is terrible

<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 13Camerupt.
<sagas> CECtheRonin: Is it similar to the first? Like a continuation? IS it also just a random series of events in a convenience store?
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<AgentKalim> This movie is now an internet forum
<Blaze> SuperBrony64: Did someone chose a PSA from the second Red Scare as a movie?
<JESmith71> I guess maybe Disney will time it so it opens around the time an Avatar sequel comes out
<TOY_PON3> dammit so much lag!!!
<Custard> Anything?
<ACS13123> Thats disturbing
<leaderoftheclub> let me guess-its STILL c"lerks"?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Biglaw: Some of it.
<sergio_scriptor> Biglaw: acutsly you are still in euro night
<AgentKalim> Go commute yourselves
<Biglaw> yay!
<CECtheRonin> sagas It's a continuation, but it's in a different place because the QuikStop burned down. It's not as random (it's got a bit more of a plot), but I think it still keeps that wit and humor.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Spade-Magnes> Is this woman dense or something?
<Kakumy> The acting horrible, completely unknown actors, story is stupid... , no humor
<Custard> DOES ANYPONY KNOW HOW LONG THE MOVIE IS
<Kakumy> Custard: it's 3 hours...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Custard: 1hr and 29 minutes
<SirGanjalf> Spade-Magnes: She is... or something.
<Kakumy> nvm...
<sagas> CECtheRonin: I may check it out later
<Custard> THANK YOU.]
<Blaze> Custard: It's Infinity x 5.
<AgentKalim> Least they weren't lit.
<Kandarihu> As far as I can tell, the only thing that Clerks and Avatar have in common are bad businessmen. And even THAT is a stretch
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Walter Flanagan, who plays the guy who buys the cigarettes even after the Chewlies Gum Rep does his lecture, is wearing one of Brian O'Halloran's stage beards as a wig.
*Custard facepalm
<xmasskills> Custard:
<Spade-Magnes> I wonder when the WiiU comes out
<sagas> IM NOT EVEN SUPPOSE TO BE HERE TODAY!
<Biglaw> soo, is this the A movie or the B movie?
<Freefall29> I think the entire budget was spent on the cameras. they used a convinence store during closing hours. that explains the black and white camera
<Custard> Ok I'll be back in about an hour
<Bronysith> Biglaw: definite B
<Irish_Pony> ello all :)

<owlicious> or did he mean gender
<ponibas> mmmm , pizza
<DeathStar> Saturn: you can connect anything to sec can't you?
<pony_132> It is interesting, that a lot of people would not figure out that cleverbot is not an actual human
<AgentKalim> Haha
<AgentKalim> really?
<TOY_PON3> Saturn: I love you for teaching me this
<AgentKalim> I talked to cleverbot ALOT. :P
<Kurra> There's also strong and weak versions of this.
<pony_132> AgentKalim: There are experiments on a regular basis.
<Randomnerd> Turing also believed an AI could play chess!
<owlicious> it can
<CoalDust> ah, makes sence to me
<Chrysalis> Randomnerd an AI can play chess
<Kurra> I wanna pass a Turing test online.
<AgentKalim> Well, an AI can totally play chess.
<Randomnerd> I'm reading a bout the Turk this weekend.
<Majestic_Sparkler> I think Saturn is an AI
<owlicious> but consciousness is probably beyond our lifetimes
<Kurra> DRAW ON THE WALL
<twilight_sprinkle> use your wall!
<otakon> brb guys, need bathroom
<Kurra> WALL
<pony_132> "Cleverbot took part alongside humans in a formal Turing Test at the 2011 Techniche festival at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati on September 3, 2011. Out of the 1,334 votes cast, Cleverbot was judged to be 59.3% human, compared to the rating of 63.3% human achieved by the actual humans. A score of 50% or higher is often considered to be a pass of the Turing Test."
<Randomnerd> It was a chess playing Robot.
<diddutz> i want a whitebord :3
<pony_132> Argh
<MysteryGuitarDash> There's a wall
<Barbetos> Saturn Draw it in paint on your pc?
<Majestic_Sparkler> TEXT WALL
<Kurra> WALL
<Ninjazz> Saturn: You have a white wall. Just get yourself a sharpie. ^_^
<Lil_B> Randomnerd my Uncle had an Old Chess-PC that woud need 1 hour for his turn on the hardest difficulty XD
<Kurra> Noooooo
<Randomnerd> Chrysalis: I'm agreeing, I've been reading about Turing.
<Kurra> Oh yay
<TOY_PON3> do it filly
<Kurra> Shoot, my bad.
<pony_132> AgentKalim: http://derpy.me/BoaHk
<Barbetos> NEVER CLEAN IT
<owlicious> Regular language is best language. CFGs are evil
<Vordox> Get a doodle program so you can draw on your screen? :P
<Kurra> YES

<Kandarihu> Vordox: as in a telestrator?

<Randomnerd> Bye, TOY_PON3
<DeathStar> Saturn: but we like your ranting!

<AgentKalim> Ohhhhh
<AgentKalim> I get it
<Ran> 2Mmmm
<Barbetos> Philosophy.... mmmmmm.. tastey
<DocSane> ...?
<Majestic_Sparkler> I need something...
<owlicious> Saturn: The lookup table has to be able to modify part of itself
<Starlight_Phoenix> whats on stream?
<AgentKalim> It's the problem of communication between a binary "speaking" AI and an english-speaking human.
<Randomnerd> Searle is such a killjoy.
<twilight_sprinkle> but what if the guy figures out rules from the cards
<DeathStar> Saturn: so no R2D2 :'(
<pony_132> Well, humans are also just very complex machines
<twilight_sprinkle> then he can get an understadning
<Starlight_Phoenix> ???
<DocSane> But... Natural intelligence is essentially a long chain of learned responses to various situations.
<Randomnerd> Extreme Pyrrhonism!
<twilight_sprinkle> <.<
<Randomnerd> Can't be certain of ANYTHING!
<alexxm> sex
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Oh God Saturn
<AgentKalim> DocSane: Yep, that's what we learned in psychology
<owlicious> :D
<Barbetos> The analogy of the room is so completely wrong.
<Ninjazz> Dat Big Ol' Gay. :D
<Vordox> greece?
<owlicious> and he was an athlete
<Ran> 2Fun fact, the Korean version of Pocky (Pepero) celebrates Pepero Day on the same day as my birthday
<GilDash> Saturn: Didn't he get the death penalty? :(
<CoalDust> thats an interestint way to put it
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look, i need to tie my shoes...over there
<owlicious> no, he got chemical castration
<DocSane> AgentKalim: One might argue that "intelligence" is simply choosing the appropriate response to any situation based on past data.
<RyunosukeKnT> "but but saturn, YOu had sheep! BAAAA~~~" :)
<MysteryGuitarDash> The death PENALty
<owlicious> hahaha sheep
<GilDash> GilDash: Sorry, I meant castration.
<DeathStar> Saturn: that's why the anchient greeks are cool
<AgentKalim> DocSane: That is the exact definition we used, actually. :P
<MysteryGuitarDash> IF you know what i mean
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He got the Saturn penalty.
<GilDash> GilDash: I just replied to myself. :D
*Barbetos crazy arm gestures!
<Randomnerd> GilDash: Yeah, pretty horrifying.
<GilDash> ... I'm gonna stop talking.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: oh god, not the saturn penalty....
<Skylands> 10:O
<Airpuff> GilDash :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: O_O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes. The Saturn penalty.
<AgentKalim> gay babies :P
<DocSane> AgentKalim: I never took any psych courses in uni.
<Kurra> Not VERY gay XD
<AgentKalim> ohmanthat'sprettygreat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: Sounds intersting
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: sounds scary to me
<DocSane> But hwo is this dude and why are we watching him?
<Ran> 2I used to get Pepero all the time, since the guy who ran the corner store near my house was Korean <3
<CoalDust> its kinda silly that they made it elegal for a time
<owlicious> DocSane: it's Saturn(Andrew)
<hen3ry> not just gay. cybersexual
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: hes saturn, one of the mods
<Ninjazz> Ew. Gross.
<DeathStar> no baby Saturn ken is ment to marry barby not G.I joe!
<alexxm> CoalDust saturn
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: as to why, it depends on what youre itnerested in
<DocSane> Ah.
<dutchbrony> did he kill himself?
<Skylands> 10I can only find strawberry and chocolate Pocky in one store around here
<GilDash> Saturn: Persecuted, not prosecuted.
<DocSane> He seems to be discussing AI and the sad life and death of Alan Turing.
<CoalDust> hmmm what do you meen alexxm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You tell me Saturn.
<owlicious> that's what's written.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just know it's horrible.
<GilDash> Saturn: Wrong, either way.
<Ninjazz> lol
<Kandarihu> At least this didn't happen in one of these Islamic countries. He would've been executed for that.
<alexxm> CoalDust one of the mods
<Randomnerd> dutchbrony: They believe so, but there's no definitive proof.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: O_O
<Randomnerd> Snow White
<ponkiepoi> they banished him to saturn for life
<CoalDust> yes i know he is
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Snow White
<Chrysalis> the saturn penalty involves a room a lock and several private hours
<dutchbrony> ahh okay
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah
<owlicious> through the looking glass
<owlicious> ?
<Ninjazz> Snow White
<Randomnerd> Snow White has the poison apple.
<Ran> 2My friend mailed me strawberry Pocky after I'd moved, it was amazing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> dies
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah it is
<CoalDust> why are you pointing this out? alexxm
<Randomnerd> Prosecution engaged in persecution in this case...
<Kandarihu> It was a tragedy in any case.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol what a day.. we watch a mature disney movie, Clerks. and now sex talk
<DocSane> He was arrested for homosexuality and sentenced to hormone treatments.
<|Discord|> O baieverypony!
<Skylands> 10Yes
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: why did he kill himself?
<alexxm> CoalDust you wanted to know
<DocSane> So he was both persecuted AND prosecuted.
<Skylands> 10I want to try the other flavours though
<CoalDust> i did?
<GilDash> Saturn: Is it right to ask a man to live in a world that hates him so? :S
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> twilight_sprinkle: because he was gay, and was forced to do hormone treatments
<CoalDust> oh... thank you
<Randomnerd> DocSane: Yep, he was treated lik shit in a court of law.
<Kandarihu> Hormone therapy isn't the solution. He needed therapy.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: hm ok
<MysteryGuitarDash> Kak.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> twilight_sprinkle: also it was illegal to be gay in scotland
<DocSane> The solution was that homosexuality shouldn't have been a crime.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: that i know
<owlicious> ^^
<AgentKalim> Celebrate Sweetie Bot
<CoalDust> sorry perhaps im going insain again and typed stuff and forgot about it, it happens some times alexxm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh no.
<Ninjazz> lol
<AgentKalim> Gays are awrite
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: 0_0
<CoalDust> sounds legit
<dutchbrony> :D
<Ninjazz> Marriage.
<Kandarihu> I don't think it is.
<Vordox> It's a crime of nature.
<DocSane> Yes, but the Supreme Court struck those down.
<twilight_sprinkle> its a crime in religion
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> homosexuality may seem wrong, but the best thing to do is just let ppl do what they want to do
<GilDash> Saturn: That's gay marriage.
<Randomnerd> Not to mention Alan Turing provided an incalculable contribution to hte war effort.
<hen3ry> I think the Supreme Court struck down the last of those laws
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think so.
<CoalDust> i think
<owlicious> it's illegal to get married in many states, i think
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 3Lickilicky.
<Kandarihu> It's a crime punishable by death in a lot of Islamic countries.
<DocSane> We have some terribly backward states here, though.
<EccoCode> o-o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kandarihu: =/
<AgentKalim> Well, feel free to talk, you seem real happy to do so. :P
<Randomnerd> "Sodomy' Laws exist in several states, but are basically unenforcable.
<pony_132> I don't like the term "gay rights". That sounds like there should be special rights for gay people. They should just have the same rights and the same duties
<twilight_sprinkle> well why would gay marriage be legal and being gay would be illegal :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think homosexuality is legal.
<hen3ry> true. marriage is illegal in most US states, but concensual gay conduct is legal in all 50 now
<Ran> 2!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 3Sunkern.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: mmhmm
<Vordox> Homosexuality is a crime against nature, but feck nature. :P
<Barbetos> There are laws that are still around in the States, but they are not enforced most likely
<DocSane> It's not illegal to be gay, but several states made sodomy illegal.
<AgentKalim> No it's not, but feck that
<pony_132> DocSane: Well, there are some US states in which it is legal to have sex with horses, but not with another person of the same sex
<dutchbrony> in some stats it's okay to do a cow....
<hen3ry> 6.28
<twilight_sprinkle> and a crime against religion
<Kandarihu> Well, it's legal for homosexuals to get married, but in most states, they have to marry a member of the opposite gender.
<twilight_sprinkle> but religion is stupid
<legacyofvrak> It's 23 here in Argentina
<owlicious> 2pi
<ponkiepoi> it isn't really a crime against nature..
<Randomnerd> Yup.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's 2*pi
<Ninjazz> I love Pie!
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<MysteryGuitarDash> Delicious
<AgentKalim> Yes
<hen3ry> Pi >> Tau
<MysteryGuitarDash> That's what.
<legacyofvrak> 19:38 hs
<CoalDust> im ready
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I was born on Pi Day :3
<owlicious> circumference to radius!
<Randomnerd> The diameter.
<legacyofvrak> My body is ready
<AgentKalim> Two pies
<alexxm> mind blown
<danishbrony> lol this guy reminds me of Vangner Love (soccer player) http://qoo6.com/data_images/vagner-love/vagner-love-01.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> what flavar?PI FLAVAR
<RyunosukeKnT> cow pies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was born on Nittany Day.
<hen3ry> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: me too. As was Einstein :D
<GilDash> Saturn: So... Tau is 2 x Pi?
<DocSane> I live in Massachusetts, which legalized same sex marriage years ago and learned the terrible truth that it changes society...
<Vordox> I like Pie
<pony_132> You are ranting about how you are not going into rants...
<AgentKalim> It's alright, mate.
<DocSane> in that gay people can finally marry the people they love.
<owlicious> GilDash: Pi = Tau / 2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: sounds fun
<Vordox> Well be excited for Buck
<Vordox> BUCK
<Ninjazz> I was born on Pinkie's b-day.
<CoalDust> you might want to go into that rant because other wize i probably wont understand
<Saturn> 08,01http://tauday.com/
<DocSane> Aside from that, it changed absolutely nothing.
<Shizuka> 13isn't that tomorrow?
<GilDash> owlicious: Well, yes... it goes both ways. :D
<Shizuka> 13or wait
<Ninjazz> Saturn: When exactly is BUCK?
<Shizuka> 136/28
<DocSane> Oddly enough, it didn't cause a collapse of hetero marriage or for people to stop having children.
<hen3ry> I had a professor named Tao. Not quite Tau, but eh.
<otakon> DocSane: now if only the REST of the friggin US would realize that
<AgentKalim> If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.
<CoalDust> i have it book marked
<otakon> EXACTLY!
<otakon> Idiots
<Kandarihu> Well, the problem is that where gay marriage is legalized, pastors are forced to conduct the ceremonies despite their objections.
<Barbetos> It proved that homosexuals can be just as miserable as hetrosexual people! YAY!!
<pony_132> Homosexuals are gay
<otakon> COMPLETE AND UTTER IDIOTS
<Kurra> I think Saturn needs a fez :D
<Ninjazz> Ah.
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Ninjazz> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: We're Humens, we love being idiots :-l
<hen3ry> The ironically named court case: LOVING v. Virginia, struck down interracial marriage laws.
<otakon> Kandarihu: judges can process marriages
<twilight_sprinkle> screw tau, just leave pi and stop wasting attention
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pony_132: U DONT SAY
<Randomnerd> So Takei!
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 13Finneon.
<Barbetos> Jaunty fez
<AgentKalim> While on that note, people are making the same arguments against the legalization of drugs, they were making against the legalization of alcohol. Look where the fucking prohibition got America.
<Randomnerd> It's okay to be takei.
<otakon> Saturn: you need to get that pink out of your hair
<owlicious> fez's are cool
<Ran> 2Fishie!
<AgentKalim> Fezzes are cool.
<twilight_sprinkle> 'pi is wrong'
<DocSane> I remember the day after it was legalized. The Boston Globe ran a hilarious column that was headlined "Civiliazation Lies in Ruins"
<CoalDust> that would be awsome, you would be like the doctor
<twilight_sprinkle> tau site is bleh
<Barbetos> METAL!
<Randomnerd> And Fezzes are not cool.
<Ninjazz> Anime?
<otakon> DocSane: lol
<Kandarihu> Let's see some anime!
<Dark_Horst> carls sagan?
<otakon> Saturn: THINK MAN
<pony_132> I don't understand how people can be so concerned about who other people are fucking
<Randomnerd> am I right, prince-dari
<otakon> Cosmos?
<AgentKalim> My brain is derping too.
<DocSane> Carl Sagan
<Randomnerd> Carl Sagan.
<DocSane> CARL SAGAN!
<alexxm> Saturn how about some alestorm
<Ninjazz> Carl.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sarl Cagan
<dutchbrony> you have the same hair color like a girl in my class xD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Cosmo is a fairy
<Nyria> That would be awesome~
<otakon> CARL SAGAN
<CECtheRonin> Bill Nye?
<owlicious> okay, this is really an outrage. I don't know how anyone could bake a tau. Do you put a pie on top of another pie?
<otakon> lol
<hen3ry> billions and billions and billions...
<CoalDust> bill nyhe the science guy
<twilight_sprinkle> Bear Grylls
<Kandarihu> Let's see some Bill Nye!
<pony_5100> NOEL EDMONDS
<Nyria> Sid the science kid~
<otakon> like MILLIONS said that
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YES BILL NYE
<Kurra> Also the issue of gayness and other hot topic issues can be better grasped with thought and alternative discussion
<AgentKalim> And then all the girls said I'm Bill Nye the science guy.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: did you want to stream somthing
<pony_132> Louis CK has got some great bits on Gay people, gay marriage
<Randomnerd> no, prob :)
<hen3ry> Well a Tau is a doubled Pi. So...
<alexxm> Saturn how about some alestorm
<Dark_Horst> YES YOU SHOUDL!
<DocSane> Please, no.
<Dark_Horst> YES!
<AgentKalim> You should totally stream Q.

<Kandarihu> Oh yeah! Q!
<otakon> Kurra: those words don't exist in the conservative dictionary

<Dark_Horst> people need to know what discord dod before he came into the mlp universe
<CoalDust> yay
<otakon> Saturn: What do you think of Spirit's Within being picked as A movie last night?
<twilight_sprinkle> i cant believe people try to change pie with tao, why waste time on someth so meaningless

<otakon> Saturn: I did, thanks!
<Spade-Magnes> Welp! Back to Megaman Starforce 3
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: how's it questionable?
<Caramel> 2,14 questionable...
<pony_5100> it's always great to listen to someone excitedly talk about their passion!
<Ninjazz> Saturn: Thank you. Twas fun.
<Saturn> 08,01the plot's a bit hokey
<DocSane> Saturn: You really need to adjust the camera angle and light yourself a bit better.
<Saturn> 08,01but it's a decent film
<Celes_Chere> otakon: define "unquestionable"
<CoalDust> gosh i cannot spell or type todays

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Aguirre was good
<Caramel> 2,14 All of my other picks have been totally fine
<otakon> GilDash: at least Advent is fun
<AgentKalim> Because Spirits Within is not good enough to be an A movie.
<pony_132> Spirits Within didn't make any sense
<Nyria> Saturn: Aww, you're going to stop~ It was very interesting to hear you rant~
<twilight_sprinkle> Advent Children are cool <.<
<otakon> Caramel: what were your other picks?
<Caramel> 2,14 don't like it? Deal with it, you don't have to watch the fucking stream
<Spade-Magnes> That trailer for Rockman online looked so good... I wish it actually got made
<hen3ry> Gentlecolts, you can't fight in here, this is the war room.
<Caramel> 2,14 and I don't need to sit here and listen to people berate me for my pick
<AgentKalim> I know.

<CoalDust> i quite enjoyed your rant @saturn, i found it quite informative
<Spade-Magnes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397&index=46&feature=plpp_video
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: val has been out a lot lately
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hey, has there ever been a time when mods won all the picks of the lottery?
<dutchbrony> 6hours*
<Chrysalis> Aw man, he actually picked a really good movie as well
<owlicious> Buck. I missed the chance to ask him for spiderponies
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: yeah, but I didn't mean to piss him off
<Chrysalis> and just recieved hate for it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeenope, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: heh, ironic
<Chrysalis> Some people really need to grow up sometimes
<CriticKitten> Ugh
<Spade-Magnes> I hate spazzy bosses alot
<otakon> Chrysalis: it's not really that good a movie man
*CriticKitten just finished watching Korra finale.
<Kurra> I mean..
<otakon> Chrysalis: it was the Avatar of it's day
<Celes_Chere> Spirits Within makes a great case study for those of us in animation, and could have been good if they had changed a few things. I kinda like that someone had the gusto to pick it. That's all I'll say about that.
<CriticKitten> :(
<Randomnerd> It's the internet.
<alexxm> CriticKitten was it good
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: hey now, avatar was very enjoyable
<otakon> damn, now I feel like a ass
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, the Korra finale
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Spirits Within... sounds kinda not worth watching
<otakon> Saturn: yeah, but it was mostly pretty
<Saturn> 08,01because DAMN, those aliens were HOT
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> KORRA FINALE IS BEST FINALE
<Spade-Magnes> I do not like having to fight a boss that moves around at the speed of sound
<Kurra> www.internettrafficreport.com
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: o u :D
<AgentKalim> Internet, lol internet
<CriticKitten> alexxm: There were really good parts....
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: not better than Sozin's Comet
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: but they were!
<CriticKitten> And then....
<Randomnerd> I think we're all going to watch it... just that I cannot promise you'll like it.
<Kurra> stream died
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> otakon: fien
<Randomnerd> There are a lot of flaws in that movie.
<CriticKitten> There were parts that make my spirit BURN WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: well....yeah :D
<owlicious> oh. Avatar by james cameron
<Saturn> 08,01i wouldn't mind a 10ft tall blue catman sweeping me off my feet, i tell you that
<Chrysalis> Hmmm Chrysalis in avatar blue
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: finale? already?
<CriticKitten> Because of how much they piss me off
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: hmm Man huh :3
<otakon> Randomnerd: oh, I'll watch it and enjoy riffing on it here.
<Randomnerd> I <3 Steve Buscemi. He went to my High School. We're very proud of him.
<CriticKitten> So I'd say it's a "meh'
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: why catman O.O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> twilight_sprinkle it was awesome
<Kurra> I loved Final Fantasy Spirits Within. I dunna unnerstan' why everyone RAEG :[
<CriticKitten> finale overall.
<Spade-Magnes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oc409vdJwQ&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 Go Crimson Dragon music for the win
<otakon> Kurra: no one raged, it's just a boring movie really
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kurra: it sounds so uninteresting
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: isnt it soon? its been like 15 eps?
<otakon> goddammit I gotta apologize to Val when he gets back
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> twilight_sprinkle thats a good amount of episodes to stop
<Kurra> Oh really? I gots rage from people years ago, is all.
<otakon> this is my fault
<CriticKitten> Well, lemme rephrase.
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: they were basically cat people
<Ponies47> Pools all set up. I'm back :(
<BroKnee> Hello everypony :3 No stream>? D:
<AgentKalim> Cat people with USB cables
<otakon> Ponies47: Val left angry
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: they were more of monkeypeople
<otakon> BroKnee: it's coming
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yeah i guess. suddenly better than the first season ending
<GilDash> Kurra: It's alright. I do enjoy some of it, but I think the rage was it had nadda to do with the Final Fantasies before it.
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: cat. people.
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: *certainly
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Lemur people
<BroKnee> otakonOkai :3
<Ponies47> otakon: Why? :(
<CriticKitten> The Korra finale was "meh" overall. It has some good redeeming qualities to it, and then it has some parts that....well I'll be honest, are terrible.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: scratch that, CatMonkeypeople
<Kurra> I need to see Korra anything
<otakon> Ponies47: I was making a big deal of him choosing apparently "Trolling" movies for stream
<Kurra> you think I woulda seen Korra.... ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: i was question the choice of gender more than animal :D not that im saying gay is wrong or anyth
<otakon> Ponies47: and well now I feel like a right ass for doing it
<CriticKitten> And it seems that some of the questions brought up through the first season are pretty much abandoned and never answered.
<Jack-Corvus> Who wants some Slashman stage on guitar?
<CriticKitten> So yeah, for a normal show, good finale. For a follow-up to the Legend of Aang? Yeah, it doesn't hold up.
<otakon> Saturn: they are more like Lemur people to me
<MasterBoss43> *Le wild ad appears*
<otakon> CriticKitten: agreed, kind of weak compared to that
<twilight_sprinkle> i remember them as lizard people
<diddutz> <@Saturn> i wouldn't mind a 10ft tall blue catman/woman sweeping me off my feet, i tell you that -fixed
<Ponies47> otakon: I feal like a (squee) right now to. :s
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: i'll admit, i might be the tiniest bit straight
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> CriticKitten: it was the first season =/
<Kurra> XDDDD
<otakon> Ponies47: why? you didn't do anything wrong
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/B5GVt.jpg
<Randomnerd> If theres's anything MLP has taught me... it's made me a hell of alot judgmental about what interests people
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh hai Wrek
<otakon> VAL COME BACK!
<IAmNotANumber_042> Is anyone streaming at the moment?
<MasterBoss43> Saturn, what your not straight!.
<otakon> I'M SORRY!
<Firelight> Apperently....
<Club-Strong> ANyone want some Slashman stage theme on guitar?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alright enough about catmonkeypeople
<MasterBoss43> Oh fail i did !then.
<Randomnerd> I've had lots of good conversations with people I used to write off as gross.
<Saturn> 08,01MasterBoss43: just a bit
<Ponies47> otakon: I'll tell you when I get back in a few min :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lets talk about sandwichsubponies
<GilDash> Saturn: Well, everyone is supposed to hook up with you. Wouldn't work if you weren't. :p
<CriticKitten> Darkts3: The first season of Legend of Aang did a great job establishing the world, its goals, its main cast, etc, and ended on a high note.
<CoalDust> @Satern arent we all strange here, (or at least i am)
<twilight_sprinkle> im strange
<twilight_sprinkle> im a creep
<twilight_sprinkle> er
<MasterBoss43> Saturn, not even a bit!
<twilight_sprinkle> boom.
<Firelight> you know what time it is when no one is streaming?
<Club-Strong> ADVENTURE TIME!
<Kurra> One thing that pony and furryness has taught me.... you can be straight, and enjoy hugs and cuddles and good things from anyone, if you're willing to open your heart. <3 c:
<Narolas> Everyone is strange, some assume it some don't, but everyone single person is.
<Firelight> YOutube link to ponies time!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Hayeayaeyayah?
<IAmNotANumber_042> Bed time?
<CriticKitten> The first season of Korra ends with some serious questions left unanswered (likely never to be answered), only established one location in the entire world, and hasn't really pinned its cast down very well.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: dont worry its not you, he gets angry very easily, like you :D
<MasterBoss43> twilight_sprinkle Creepers arn't really just from minecraft, don't hate letter me. Love and tolerate.
<Kurra> and also, how to rave. |3
<Club-Strong> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWuJQl24aU&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
<CriticKitten> It's definitely weaker than its predecessor. Still good, but....significantly weaker.
<twilight_sprinkle> MasterBoss43: hate letter, haw?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: yeah, but I don't like making people angry...
<Spitfire> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1QyDhLj5hU
<Narolas> I feel your pain otakon :(
<Randomnerd> CriticKitten: lots of Questions that are asked in a tv show will be answered.
<otakon> CriticKitten: like what? I must have missed something here, I got NO unaswered questions
<CoalDust> i meen im a fan of thomas the tank engine to the point that i can name the year that he would have been built so, yeah im strange
<Randomnerd> Unless it's supposed to be something where thare are no easy answers.
<Club-Strong> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1d5d7yiSYw&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 I love this Megaman X2 Boss music remix
<CriticKitten> otakon: Like how the hell does that nonsensical logic of Amon work?
<Narolas> Everytime is feel or i think i might have done something wrong or made someone upset, i'm feel terrible
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: eh, val gets angry very easily, so dont kick yourself around for it
<otakon> CriticKitten: hate doesn't need logic
<Firelight> the title is not what it looks like. It's actually hilarious. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomos5A1BFE
<Randomnerd> Questions like "Who is Jon Snow's Mother?" will get answered.
<CriticKitten> The reason they give for his "skillset" does not make sense.
<otakon> CriticKitten: I can explain that easy enough
*CriticKitten is avoiding spoilers for the record, or trying at least in case people haven't seen.
<otakon> CriticKitten: yes it does
<otakon> CriticKitten: same here
<CriticKitten> No, it really doesn't.
<otakon> PM TIME!
<Randomnerd> Questions like "Is it wrong to kill a man you're sworn to protect if he's dangerous" will never get answered.
<CriticKitten> Not only are his powers illogical, but how they work is even less logical.
*Club-Strong flips a table
<Randomnerd> ...sorry, I'm reading "A Song of Ice and Fire" right now.
<Randomnerd> I'm on Book 3 :D
<Randomnerd> I love this story! :D
<Firelight> XD
<Narolas> Hey, someone might help me with this, one time Bronystate streamed a MLP YTP, that used the hearts and hooves day episode as a source, and sweetie belle says "Cherilee's a whore" at some point, anyone remember the name of that one ?
<Club-Strong> Anyone ever play Megaman Zero?
<alexxm> Randomnerd if your talking about the lannistar that killed the old king conserding he was mad i think he did the right thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Narolas: its called Friendship is Fabulous
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imgur.com/gallery/YFqtr
<Narolas> YES ! i love you Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Randomnerd> alexxm: Yes, but I'm saying there's not always an easy answer
<Narolas> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: All the hugs of the world for you
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Narolas: :3

<alexxm> nope IDAS
<twilight_sprinkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSedE5sU3uc North Korea folks. and the applauds were like "yeah not bad"
<Randomnerd> We're all raised as Utilitarians -most people have been taught that the needs of the many are greater than the needs of the few. Jamie Lannister is not from such a culture.

<Firelight> :(((
<Dken2021> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG not mips this time
<Spade-Magnes> I think my console may be broken
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: which one is it?
<Spade-Magnes> It makes alot of noise when a area in a game loads
<Kandarihu> I was pretty alright with that.
<Spade-Magnes> My black wii
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dken2012: i know
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: odd... have you cleaned it lately?
<Spade-Magnes> Apperently it cant handle being on for several hours
<Nightmare> Lets play wii bowling instead :D
<owlicious> loading
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: clean the vents
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes is it in a place for good ventilation?
<otakon> I think Netflix is just down
<Spade-Magnes> It has an open space
<ponibas> otakon it still counted from what you had typed in from when you got the auto kick from Wrek.. it was less than 10 secs befor eyou came in and posted again
<ponibas> that is why you got rebooted
<Spade-Magnes> You sure?
<Sumica> 00,10Sure bitch at me for using a 6 in 10 when you were kicked for a 5 in 10
<legacyofvrak> Let's play the Wii's sword game :D
<legacyofvrak> Dead Space
<Spade-Magnes> Because it makes noise whenever a area of a game loads
<Spade-Magnes> or when i bring up a game menu
<Sumica> 00,10how about I just set it to kick if you speek?
<ponibas> lol
<otakon> Sumica: your auto kick kicked me after a 14 second gap I COUNTED GODDAMMIT I WATCHED IT COUNT UP
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oiy
<Firelight> o3o
<Narolas> :O
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes odd, what game? or does it do that with multiple games?
<Vordox> Lawl Newtflix.
<Spade-Magnes> Dken2021: multiple
<Firelight> lol..... come on :(
<pony_1977> wii facehoof
<Kandarihu> I have to keep the sound down when I play certain games on my GCN. Sometimes, the disc reading stops working. And I hear a *click* *click* *click* *click* as the laser is trying to find the right bit. And if I don't open the game cover and close it again, it'll crash.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: sounds awes- "User has been kicked"
<Spade-Magnes> its gotten louder
<Spade-Magnes> It started happening after I played games on it for several hours in a row
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes it coud be your disc drive, but I'm no expert on it
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: you need to clean your vents man and run a laser lens cleaner in it
<alexxm> why does net flix hate us
<Firelight> UUUGh
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: that should help
<Meanwhile> otakon: you actually watch your word timers?
<Spade-Magnes> My disks have been geeting scratched for some reason
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: you startin?
<otakon> Meanwhile: that time I did, I waited so I WOULDN'T be kicked then it kicks me WAY after the message got posted
<Spade-Magnes> I think it may be cracked a bit or something..
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Spade-Magnes: Invisible Cat
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes yea, sounds like something's in your disc drive
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: do you store it flat or vertically?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's a script otakon and there are 6 servers on this network we are not on the same server there is a delay.
<Kandarihu> The only game that averts a crash assuming the disc to be invalid without that is Twilight Princess.
<Meanwhile> No. :I
<Spade-Magnes> I think the black one is a sideways flat modle
<Meanwhile> otakon: Man you're just unlucky.
<otakon> Sumica: a 5 second delay on a message that had a 14 second gap?
<Shamroc> just makin sure
<Spitfire> :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SONY
<Bronysith> PS3!
<hen3ry> occasionally somepony will be kicked for _1_ message in 10 seconds, due to irc server lag. Everything hits someone at the same time, so the script triggers.
<otakon> I did not know SuperBrony64 had a PS3
<Irish_Pony> PS3!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Irish_Pony> HOLY CRAP
<Shamroc> SuperBrony64: playin ur ps3 i see

*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s head
<Spade-Magnes> I cant belive the thing is pretty much busted because I just played games on it for several hours in a row
<AgentKalim> Let's not start a console war, please
<AgentKalim> Hi, FlutterBitch

<Shamroc> oh hai Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10hey otakon remember when we used to ban for geting kicked too many times?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: isnt startin for once its amazing
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I think Netflix is just outright down man
*Bronysith simply waits on Meanwhile s head
<DocSane> Clearly, he has no net connection. Oh, wait...
<Meanwhile> THERE'S A FUCKING MOTH ATTACKING ME.
<Spade-Magnes> I mean the Owners manual for the console doesnt mention anywhere that leaving it on for a long time can damage the console
<otakon> Sumica: yeah I do, since you know I've been PLAY KICKED MULTIPLE TIMES FOR TEH LUZ
<Dken2021> Meanwhile use a lighter
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Meanwhile: Use your Slap attack
<CoalDust> hey im back, what did i miss
<FlutterBitch> KILL THE MOTH WITH FIRE!!!:[
<hen3ry> dat awesome wifi
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: I don't smoke.
<Spade-Magnes> I am sad now....
<DocSane> Quick! Copy his WEP key!
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: good man
<hen3ry> darn I was too slow
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: id rather have a sweet treat
<otakon> CoalDust: Netflix is dead apparently and Meanwhile got attacked by a moth
<Ponies47> Spade-Magnes: Why? :(
<Spade-Magnes> Ponies47: My wii console is pretty much dead
<Ponies47> Spade-Magnes: Dawwwww :<
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, Spoony's been fired.
<hen3ry> 5.1 is a lie
<AgentKalim> I noticed
<hen3ry> oooh! My burgers are almost done. :D
<AgentKalim> I was like "wait, seriously?"
<DocSane> Spoony from That Guy With the Glasses
<AgentKalim> Yes
<otakon> CriticKitten: NO! Not Spoony! I liked him ...
<owlicious> Wait, what's his WEP Key. I need to build a satellite array facing his coordinates to get free wifi
<DocSane> Spoony from That Guy With the Glasses?
<Dken2021> CriticKitten and I say it's good for him
<CoalDust> what?, ok i am up to speed in the kind of way that leaves me lost i gess...
<AgentKalim> Yes, that Spoony.
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<DocSane> Any reason given?
<otakon> Netflix JUST FOR KIDS!
<Spade-Magnes> Leaving the console on for several hours should not damage the console
<CriticKitten> They're trying to claim it had nothing to do with the Lupa incident, but I'm not fooled.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Eternal hellfire, for kids.
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: it wears out the motors
<CriticKitten> >_>
<FlutterBitch> whats this?
<DavidCortez> otakon: That awkward moment when DBZ is there. 6_9
<Bronysith> What supplies does this give you in Counter strike source? B32 B62 B63
<Spade-Magnes> Well it would be nice if the manual mentioned that
<CoalDust> ok so i guess we are wathcing netfix
<owlicious> hahahahahaha
<Vordox> He has a point XD
<DocSane> CriticKitten: Lupa incident?
<Nightmare> That oddly makes some sort of sense
<AgentKalim> What's this? An actually good point?
<Spade-Magnes> You fucking bitch
<Narolas> The funny thing is, he's right
<Meanwhile> Cannival.
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: clean your vents on it, store it horizontally and clean the inside with a laser lens cleaner
<turtlegod98> says the fat bitch
<Dken2021> Louise you aren't helping
<Kandarihu> Okay. That daughter needs a spanking.

<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad 4G?
<CoalDust> well that got out of hand rather fans
<turtlegod98> no
<CoalDust> fast*
<hen3ry> damn rhyme
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: dry toothbrush to GENTLY clean the vents on the system
<turtlegod98> lol
<DavidCortez> It's orange! What now? :[
<Nightmare> hahaha
<hen3ry> and seriously, health inspector had, what, 30 other violations in 5 minutes? He doesn't even need the cannibalism charge
<Spade-Magnes> So how will a laser disk cleaner help?
<Narolas> There's technically nothing wrong with cannibalism, except the fact that biologically it's not really the healthiest thing for you to eat
<CriticKitten> DocSane: Spoony made a tasteless rape joke, Lupa freaked out about it and wouldn't leave him alone even months later, and she's apparently good friends with Channel Awesome's head of HR.
<turtlegod98> lol
<Meanwhile> Nice self esteem.
<CoalDust> so much lag on my end :'(
<Dken2021> bob's not that fat
<otakon> Sumica: you still there man? I apologize for getting my jimmies rustled over that errant kick
<Bronysith> Meanwhile s moustache >Bobs moustache
<hen3ry> yeah, he is pear shaped...
<AgentKalim> Stop talking to the restaurant
<DocSane> CriticKitten: And he never issued an apology?
<otakon> CriticKitten: well hell, that sucks
<CriticKitten> So basically Spoony made a bunch of very stupid comments, a couple of CA people did so too, and the whole lot of them are scum.
<turtlegod98> wat
<sagas> thats good
<otakon> CriticKitten: well damn that sucks though
<CriticKitten> He's still got his own website.
<Spade-Magnes> otakon: so how will a laser disk cleaner help?
<Sumica> 00,10Oki, no worries otakon
<CriticKitten> He just won't appear on TGWTG.
<IDAS> sagas: Milo is funniest Bender
<Dken2021> CriticKitten I think he needs a break
<drf-Droid> yes
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: it takes a very little brush on a disc that cleans debris from the laser lens
<drf-Droid> California is annoying like that
<IDAS> Sumica: Milo is the funniest bender
<sagas> IDAS: Meh I guess so
<turtlegod98> wat
<Narolas> The fact people consider cannibalism horrible it's because it's always linked inconsciously to murder, like aborigens killing people to eat them later
<pony_1977> xD
<IDAS> sagas: remeber in ep 10 of korra
<otakon> Grand Re Re Re RE opening
<CriticKitten> Dken: It might help, yes. But some of the comments his "friends" on CA made about him were pretty tasteless too.
<sagas> IDAS: yes
<IDAS> sagas: he says the most silly things
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts otakon
<IDAS> sagas: u shall see in the season finale
<otakon> Narolas: well, not only that it leads to horrible diseases
<Spade-Magnes> also Im not sure they black wii is supposed to be stored horizontal
<CriticKitten> No wonder the poor boy's depressed. With shitty friends like that, who needs enemies? >_>
<sagas> IDAS: already watched it
<turtlegod98> lol
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: well, the thing is storing it vertically can cause the disc position to slip
<IDAS> sagas: the finale?
<otakon> brb
<Narolas> otakon : Yes, but that's not a reason to consider cannibalists "monsters", that justs makes them stupid
<sagas> IDAS: yes
<IDAS> sagas: ill pm u what im talking about
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> DANGIT BOBBEH

<CoalDust> not a bad show
<DavidCortez> I give it a solid 6.5/10
<otakon> Bronysith: we got bbq pork and beef in my backyard right now
<CriticKitten> One dude on TGWTG went so far as to encourage Spoony to commit suicide, apparently....uh. Yeah. I hope he's fired too, or I think my brain just burst a vessel. :|
*SuperBrony64 picks up DeathStar and gives her a big hug 'Hai :3'
<Ponies47> Pretty good. First time watching cheeseburger/10

<DavidCortez> Next ep! :$
<Dken2021> when this came out, I didn't like how fox advertised it as the new simpsons
<Kandarihu> What did I give Clerks? 6/10? This is better... 8.5/10, perhaps
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 back 'hwi ^^"
<Narolas> That was pretty good, i might like this after all, it'll grow on me

<Rainbow> Biglaw: BEcause all the others did
<Ponies47> MasterBoss43: Yeah. When I went back to the table they asked me 'What was that all about?' I just said 'Ah nothing' I said it all calm didn't get scared at all :P

<otakon> Biglaw: we can only be so lucky man
<Eztio> STEVEN!!! TICKETS!!!1

<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Ponies47: Sup? *Acts gangsta*
<Eztio> Do not jinx it or pinkie pie will get you
<Spade-Magnes> WHY SUPER WHY
<Freefall29> Custard: I was joking the whole time. I didn't think you take me serious. if you delete system32... your pc will crash since it needs system32 to run. it was an old internet joke
<AgentKalim> I see you're gangsta.
<mitamaking> Biglaw: You forgot the movie
<AgentKalim> I'm pretty gangsta myself.
<AJIsBestPony> Season 3 is gonna be the last, it would be too expensive for The Hub to order any more other than that.
*Custard facepalm
<otakon> Custard: DO NOT DO THAT!
<Ponies47> Bunny_Maid_Luna: *Puts on sunglasses* Nothing much. B)
<DavidCortez> I can't wait for Pikmin 3
<Custard> I'm lucky I didnt do that
<Custard> LOL IM SAFE XD
<Spade-Magnes> AJIsAwesome_: get out of here
<Rainbow> STEVE IS EVERYWHERE
<otakon> AJIsBestPony: that kind of sucks but it was good while it lasted
<DavidCortez> I need to beat Pikmin 1 however...but I suck at it
<Freefall29> did you really believe me Custard?
<Barbetos> So chat. I hear your like mudkips.
<mitamaking> water
<otakon> Barbetos: no, no we don't
<mitamaking> Barbetos: I like Squirtles
<owlicious> it'll be fine if you format C:
<Spade-Magnes> I like Snivys
<otakon> seriously, WHAT started the whole Mudkips thing?
<Custard> I am very gullible, but I have a friend that believed me when I said pomegranate juice was blood and crackers were skin.
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Ponies47:*Puts on Glasses too* Cool B|
<otakon> owlicious: STOP THAT!
<Barbetos> otakon awww, not even a little?
<Custard> :(
<otakon> Custard: do NOT listen to them about that!
<Rainbow> THROW THE TINY ALIENS AT THE DEADLY CREATURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT! Yeah, that'll work...
<AJIsAwesome_> Why?
<Barbetos> mitamaking its all about charmander
<owlicious> rm -rf /* ?
<AJIsBestPony> I mean, nothing is official yet, so we might get another, but shows get more expensive after three seasons because they have to pay the animators more
<Custard> otakon: Didn't delete it yet :)
<JESmith71> If MLP did go six seasons then the quality would go down and start sucking in the last two
<otakon> Custard: C: is your main hard drive, if you format it you'll delete EVERYTHING on your PC
<sagas> laggy
<Spade-Magnes> Dude the show is popular
<mitamaking> Barbetos: One water gun to Charmander's tail
<Ponies47> Bunny_Maid_Luna: eeyup B)
*Custard nods
<Rainbow> JESmith71: That would be sad.
<AJIsBestPony> owlicious: brb, entering that into terminal
<Spade-Magnes> Try to have hope for it...jesus...
<Freefall29> Custard: i'm just not gonna play old internet jokes from the year 2000 on ya
<Meanwhile> Is there an option to set all of them on fire?
<owlicious> oops
<Eztio> bum rush the giant one!
<owlicious> you have to be root, i think
<AgentKalim> Set ALL of them on fire.
<Barbetos> mitamaking Charmander - a real mans pokeman
<Custard> Freefall29: ...Ok.
<otakon> Custard: just don't listen to ANYONES advice here about PC maintenance unless they're a mod
<Rainbow> BUTT RUSH
<Spade-Magnes> Gah lag
<Rainbow> ASS RUSh
<Eztio> tis thine only eay
<mitamaking> Barbetos: If your a girl maybe :p

<Spade-Magnes> Magicarp ftw
<AJIsBestPony> So sudo rm -rf /* ?
<Kandarihu> Well, if anyone tells you to delete System32, it's obviously not sound advice.
<Freefall29> who said that season 3 was gonna be the final season... somebody in chat said it
<Custard> I have a question :$
<Rainbow> Eztio: The term is "ass rush" or "plot rush".
<Bronysith> i love counter strike and tf2 and l4d and l4d2 for no stupid iron sight aiming
<JESmith71> I mean, would you guys rather have MLP end while it's still good, or have it keep going on and risk a drop in quality?
<otakon> Freefall29: AJIsBestPony IIRC
<AgentKalim> Boss rush
<Barbetos> otakon I'll just preoccupy him with my golding and run away.
<P4NGYA> fowardslash join #channelname
<Biglaw> imagine if MLP went for as long as the simpsons have
<otakon> JESmith71: end while it's still good
<Rainbow> RUSH HIM WITH YOUR ASS
<Spade-Magnes> Im not going to buy what anyone says unless its legit
<Freefall29> otakon: is it true season 3 being the last season?
<Eztio> Rainbow: I still prefer bum rush
<otakon> Biglaw: NO
<MaidSurge> I'm back! Is it Pikmin time?
<mitamaking> JESmith71: I rather it not get canceled and stay good
<CoalDust> i dont know why, but for some reason my norton protection softwar is blocking EQD
<Custard> I have a question
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> I gonna fail anyways,so #Spike
<AJIsBestPony> There is a good chance that it will, nothing is certain
<otakon> Freefall29: don't know
<AgentKalim> We don't know.
<otakon> Custard: shot
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> STEVE
<otakon> Bunny_Maid_Luna: fail what dear?
<Spade-Magnes> Nice to know alot of you dont have high hopes for it continuing
<Ponies47|Shower> You know the drill. Shower be back in a few :P
<WindWhistler> Gah, my stream is derping.
<Rainbow> BEAT THE PLANTS TO DEATH
<AJIsBestPony> A lot of animated shows don't go past three seasons or they have to pay animators more, fucking unions
<mitamaking> Flower!!!!!
<WindWhistler> D:
<Rainbow> It grew a puberty?
<otakon> Rainbow: eeyup
<Spitfire> STEV- wait... you have a flower, YOUR NOT STEVE |:C
<Kandarihu> Well, if that EMP happens, it will be. Not because of any plans of Hasbro, though.
<Custard> otakon: Is it possible to add a little heading thing to the top of a chat?
<Barbetos> Drinks the nectar and becomes more powerful?
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: I am okay with animators getting paid
<AgentKalim> Captain Trollimar
<otakon> Custard: only if your a admin
<Rainbow> THAT STEVE IS A SPY
<TOY_PON3> okay back :)
<tigher1001> what is the game even about
<Custard> otakon: Ok so any chat if you're admin?
<Eztio> What is that noise?
<tigher1001> ?
<otakon> BREAK DOWN THE WALL!
<Freefall29> the internet would not be able to function properly without new pony episodes
<Bronysith> tigher1001: paying off debt
<AJIsBestPony> That's why they renamed Aqua Teen Hunger Force, its technically a completely differant show
<Spitfire> tigher1001: leading an army to it's death :3
<Custard> KILL THE WALL NOW :D
<otakon> Custard: dude, the mods are usually the admins
<mitamaking> tigher1001: Invading Earth
<AgentKalim> Are they headbanging that wall?
<Rainbow> tigher1001: Throwing defenseless creatures at deadly monsters.
<Rainbow> LOL
<TOY_PON3> die Pikmin! DIE!
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: aqua teen hunger force was good
<Freefall29> koolaid man... go!
<otakon> Rainbow: yet they manage to WIN somehow
<AJIsBestPony> ATHF was hilarious
<tigher1001> rainbow: seemes legit
<Rainbow> STOP MAKING ME LAUGH
<Biglaw> the sound...
<Barbetos> Beat the wall!
<Rainbow> I AM CRACKING UP
<AJIsBestPony> The Aqua Unit Patrol Squad or whatever it is is dumb
<Eztio> XD
<Spitfire> SuperBrony64: quick release the one they call STEVE, to smite your enemies 0_____________0
<Biglaw> Do not listen with your eyes closed
<Custard> otakon: So, if you made a little chat thing like #Custard you could add a heading, because you made it?
<Rainbow> HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE"S STEVEY!
<Kandarihu> I never really stopped Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<tigher1001> OK WHO'S PLAYING THE DRUMS
<otakon> Custard: yeah, but don't since your not supposd to
<otakon> tigher1001: lol
<TOY_PON3> slaughter slaughter EVERYTHING!
<Custard> otakon: Ok :3
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: your listening to it with your eyes closed arent ya?
<MaidSurge> SuperBrony64! I'm back! :D
<Rainbow> HEEERE'S STEVE!
<Vordox> This osund makes it sound like a brainwash
<JESmith71> ...then again MLP won't really "end", just FiM. Hasbro would probably make an G5 after that
<Kandarihu> It was the longest-lasting of Adult Swim's original lineup.
<Nightmare> Am I the only one who can't stop listening to Pinkielicious?
<Rainbow> JESmith71: I wonder what it would be like...
<Eztio> Can i see Melee
<Spitfire> if none of you watch chuggaconroy, the you dont know who steve is
<Barbetos> The pikmin are like ants.
*Custard blinks
*Spitfire puts on stupid hipster glasses
<Barbetos> kinda scarey really.
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Are ya getting my messages?
<LightningDashFast> hey everypony
<AgentKalim> Pik mini
<mitamaking> I am waiting for Derpylicious
<Spade-Magnes> He forever regretes creating the steve joke
<Freefall29> JESmith71: generation 5 is gonna suck if they turn it back to the old generations
<Rainbow> JESmith71: Do you think it would have the original ideas or the same characters?
<Spade-Magnes> *regrets
<WindWhistler> Oh yeah, something interesting. If you kill the enemy while it's in themiddle of eating your Pikmin, the Pikmin will survive.
<mitamaking> 100 pikmin rule
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol ejecting seeds
<AJIsAwesome> Steve is the red pikmin right?
<Rainbow> I bet in the last episode the CMC get their Cutie Marks.
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 hit himself
*Custard ears twitch at sounds
<AgentKalim> I bet they aren't.
<LightningDashFast> wat
<AJIsAwesome> Was somebody impersonating me?
<mitamaking> Rainbow: Final episode it is all a dream from when Twillight tried to birth the dragon
<Custard> BRB :D
<Freefall29> they will never get their cutie marks. they have no other purpose in the show for plots
<Rainbow> Pull defenseless creatures out of the grounds.
<Nightmare> Rainbow: Rainbow Dash better become a Wonderbolt or tables will be flipped.
<Rainbow> Rainbow: YES.
<Eztio> Sweetie belle's is obviously singing i think
<JESmith71> I mean, would Hasbro try to make it like FiM and try to repeat its success and try to copy it in further gens?
<owlicious> scootaloo better not get her cutie mark
<Spitfire> AJIsAwesome: The Origin of Steve is from ChuggaaConroy’s Pikmin Let’s Play. In it Chuggaa (laying as Olimar) pulls a Pikmin out of the Ground and decides to name Him Steve. In a Later episode Steve is officially Labeled a Trooper for Pulling back a Dead Fire-Breathing Pig into the Darkness of the Night
<Spitfire> sorry for the wall
<Spade-Magnes> Spitfire: and he forever regrets it
<owlicious> if scootaloo does her special talent should be orange and/or roosters
<mitamaking> laying as Olimar, the Pikmin 1 Easter Egg?
<tigher1001> they carry the corpse to the strange divice
<Kandarihu> Well, if Rainbow Dash becomes a Wonderbolt, she might not be able to be part of the mane cast anymore.
<Rainbow> Popular background ponies should become side characters who speak.
<tigher1001> and get turned into cupcakes
<otakon> STEVE WILL FOREVER BE REMEMBERED!
<Spitfire> mitamaking: typo
<AgentKalim> And fanon will be ruined forever.
<Rainbow> tigher1001: NO
<owlicious> derpy should become the element of loyalty
<mitamaking> :p
<tigher1001> lol
<Spade-Magnes> Woah lag!
<otakon> Rainbow: has to be careful doing that
<owlicious> or of muffins. I'm not picky
<AgentKalim> Muuuuuuuffins
<Rainbow> owlicious: Element of derp
<Derpy_Hooves> owlicious: nu uh D: im the element of generousity :3
<JESmith71> I mean it could end with everyone's dreams coming true. RD being a Wondebolt, CMC getting cutie marks, etc
<Freefall29> derpy should become the elements of muffins
<turtlegod98> i feel sad
<AJIsAwesome> I know that.
<Eztio> e_O what is that!?
<TOY_PON3> hi Derpy_Hooves

*Freefall29 slaps AgentKalim
<MahBoi777> mitamaking: that seems legit
<MaidSurge> Oh no! I smell a boss fight!

<Rainbow> AgentKalim: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<LightningDashFast> yeah a derpy episode ftw
<Nightmare> Eztio: You can right-click their name and open a private message
<tigher1001> sigh*

<turtlegod98> if i had a pound for every depressed cell in my body...i'd be rich...:'(
<Eztio> and for one in the chat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: IKR
<P4NGYA> why are all these pikmin following this guy?
<Spade-Magnes> Also people seem to forget their own princess luna...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> P4NGYA: he's a god
<mitamaking> P4NGYA: Power
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ^
<AgentKalim> But Luna is my favourite Princess
<Eztio> I say we need more Luna, Derpy and Vinyl episodes.
<mitamaking> AgentKalim: Is there any other choice?
<LightningDashFast> Luna is best gamer
<Freefall29> as long as spike gets his episode in season 3... i'm happy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nightmare Moon turned into a cannibal creature a year after she was defeated.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: no
<AgentKalim> What
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Spade-Magnes: the S2 luna episode shows how smart Lauren's Writers are =/
<AgentKalim> no

<Spade-Magnes> They had a freaking celebration and luna was there, yet they still think she was nightmare moon
<MahBoi777> Eztio: just type their name and ur message. if u hit tab when putting in the first few letters it will auto-fill the rest of their name

<Spade-Magnes> the predators become active
<Freefall29> fight
<Custard> Im listening to fluttershy cheer in multiplew languages

<Spitfire> nu ; A;
<Kandarihu> otakon: the most dangerous monsters come out at night.
<Custard> multiple*
<MahBoi777> it's like minecraft

<otakon> FIGHT THEM UNTIL DAWN!
<AgentKalim> everything is like minecraft
<mitamaking> ahhh such great music
<Rainbow> Jappleack
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> otakon: again, im number 2 :3
<JESmith71> Or the final episode of MLP could be that it's all in a character's mind:
<LightningDashFast> Sweetiebot
<JESmith71> http://bawwbot.net/pix/775.jpg
<Freefall29> they should do another giant spike sort of thing. that was cool
<Spade-Magnes> You're about the size of a dime
<turtlegod98> never felt so depressed
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: huh? number 2 why?
<Ponies47> I'm back :P

<MahBoi777> hi Ponies47
<Shamroc> le moop
<mitamaking> It turns out it is all in Derpy's snowglobe
<Eztio> as long as i don;t hear chicken Scootaloo and Applebloom
<Spade-Magnes> Also I love how Celestia does nothing to help her kingdom with issues
<Meanwhile> Really, where's the "set them on fire" button?
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: the monsters in Dragon's Dogma make you look about the size of a dime in comparison
<LightningDashFast> Cutiemark Aquistion program
<Ponies47> Hi MahBoi777 :)
<otakon> Meanwhile: I wish
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> MLP ending should be about Twilight reading a book to children
<Rainbow> JESmith71: THa... was sad. :'(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> human i mean
<AgentKalim> Cutie mark acquisition program
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: how are you?
<otakon> Meanwhile: advanced spaceships...NO WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH
<Spitfire> chuggaconroy's most feared enemy: THE WALLYWOG
<MasterBoss43> WTF?

<MasterBoss43> ...
<MasterBoss43> :D
<Rainbow> AgentKalim: SMOOTY SNARKY VADERS
<Spade-Magnes> Dragon threatening ponyville? Does nothing
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Fine. My brother is mad at me. :$
<Eztio> 300 dragons mabye?
<Freefall29> Spade-Magnes: or just send in fluttershy
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: why?
<Rainbow> See ya for now, everypony. Gonna watch FiW!
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: sent the Wonderbolts, sleeping dragon wasn't ATTACKING anyone just sleeping
<LightningDashFast> set phasers to hug
<otakon> bye Rainbow take care
<MahBoi777> bye Rainbow
<mitamaking> Still think St. Elsewhere ending with Derpy would be awesome
<Spade-Magnes> The smog was a issue
<Eztio> Rainbow: Bye
<Nightmare> Chao Rainbow
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: He may have amde me blow my fuse and I my have just attacked him outta rage. :$
<Ponies47> *made
<Spade-Magnes> And its clearly visable from the sky so she should have seen it and done something
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: dat temper
<Spade-Magnes> But no she lets twilight do all the work...as usual
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: LEARNING EXPERIENCES
<mitamaking> Spade-Magnes: She has to get her intern credits someho
<mitamaking> *somehow
<Spade-Magnes> That put your life at risk?
<AgentKalim> Celestia COULD solve everything... but then nopony would learn anything.
<LightningDashFast> Jappleack-Forget You I can eat all these apples
<Meanwhile> otakon: you'd think they'd at least wear protective gear.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> AgentKalim: nah she does nothing
<MahBoi777> AgentKalim: let's go with that
<mitamaking> She fought Chyrsallis(sp)....
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: He was asking for it. Plus I wanted revange for treating me like garbage alot. :$
<Spade-Magnes> Knows Twilight has 5 friends, sends 2 tickets
<otakon> mitamaking: yeah, and sadly LOST
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: For him treating me like garbage
<Spade-Magnes> The fuck celestia
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> i love eating sunseed berries
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: she's a Princess not a god
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> otakon: lol she is
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: she can make a mistake
<Eztio> 10% down 90% to go
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: no, she's not
<LightningDashFast> shes a demigoddess though
<mitamaking> otakon: That is how they treat her in show
<Spade-Magnes> She perfectly knew when they met she had 5 friends
<tigher1001> back:)
<otakon> mitamaking: yeah, but she's not a god
<AgentKalim> otakon: Says who?
<tigher1001> dodedooooodeodeod
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: sibling rivalry, lol I know it all too well. You'll get along with ur brother someday....I hope lol
<mitamaking> She is as much of a god as Apollo
<Spade-Magnes> at the end she clearly met all 5 of them!
<otakon> AgentKalim: good point
<Spade-Magnes> So theres no excuse
<tigher1001> HEY THERE I JUST MET YOU
<otakon> ARGH!
<tigher1001> AND THIS IS CRAZY
<LightningDashFast> she probably has a finite lifespan
<Rainbow> THE SNOOTY SNARK EVADERS!
<tigher1001> BUT HERES MY NUMBER
<LightningDashFast> ala the suns lifespan
<Kandarihu> I'm thinking some of the Flower Pikmin who died yesterday sprouted when they died.
<mitamaking> Is Candace immortal too?
<tigher1001> SO CALLME MABYE
<otakon> LightningDashFast: oh god, please dont' let them run Celestia's death.....
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Problem is he hates about everything I do. The biggest me being a brony. He hates bronies and MLP so much. :s
<Kandarihu> Er, where they died.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> mitamaking: *shrug*
<turtlegod98> Emotions are what make us human, it's also what makes us change. But can we change? That depends wether you and the people around you let go of the past and focus on the future.
<otakon> mitamaking: she's a Alicorn and we know NOTHING really about them except that apparently they are all apart of the royal family
<Spade-Magnes> I think the ticket issue was another bullshit test for twilight
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: who's older?
<otakon> except Blueblood
<Rainbow> otakon: They are immortal
<otakon> hes a dick
<Freefall29> Spade-Magnes: naw... princess celestia was just being a troll
<AgentKalim> Ohman that ONE sound the pikmin make. Yeah, you know which one.
<Eztio> What is the history of the Alicorns?
<otakon> Rainbow: not neccesarily, and I though you were leaving
<Bronysith> Freefall29: trollestia
<otakon> Eztio: we don't know
<LightningDashFast> otacon:dont worry she will probably live a very VERY long time after the mane six are gone
<Kandarihu> The ticket issue was a clerical error.
<otakon> DOWN THE HOLE!
<otakon> Kandarihu: that what I think
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: He is. I'm 14 he's 16
<Freefall29> hey Bronysith glad to see you in the chat now
<tigher1001> I REGRET NOOOOOOTHIIIING
<Rainbow> otakon: I did! And now I'm back!
<MaidSurge> Time for monsters!
<Bronysith> Freefall29: ive been here numb flank
<Spade-Magnes> Also She's a imortal goddess yet she doesnt know what parasprites are..
<Spade-Magnes> *immortal
<mitamaking> All I know is Hearts Warming Eve was before Celestia but she ws still on the flag
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: she doesnt' get out much
<AgentKalim> She's trollin
<Eztio> Hey pla theres a chocolate bar over that rail
<mitamaking> *was
<turtlegod98> Change is never easy, but it's worth it at the end.
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: ah I see, mah bro doesn't even know I'm a brony
<otakon> mitamaking: it was a prop, and probably artistic license
<Rainbow> Don't close your eyes while listening to this.
<AgentKalim> Yeah
<LightningDashFast> i wonder what she will do when the mane six pass on though?
<AgentKalim> Let's go with that.
<mitamaking> otakon: Pretty big plot hole
<Spade-Magnes> Also she never bothers educating Luna on how things have changed
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: no she didn't
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 5Drifblim.
<owlicious> but it's funny
<Staraptor> 2!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Staraptor, you are a 10Seedot.
<AgentKalim> She's obviously a big proponent of trollparenting. Like my dad.
*drf-Droid sighs
<Skylands> 10Team Plasma's theme just got better
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Everypony knows I'm one! Well but for a few poeple like my dad :s
<Rainbow> owlicious: If you do... it is LOLZ

<turtlegod98> It's never easy admitting to what you are, but once you have their's no turning backl.
<Skylands> 10for BW2
<Spade-Magnes> Again probably a bullshit friendship lesson
<Freefall29> turtlegod98: how so?
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: seriously though, what good is it to have the omnipotent character solve EVERY PROBLEM? reminds me of Althena from Lunar series
<LightningDashFast> i wonder what she will do when the mane six pass on though?
<mitamaking> Dead Pimin
<tigher1001> DAT NOISE
<otakon> I SEE A DPAD!
<Spade-Magnes> I know but seriously? Send your sister who has been out of touch for 1000 years and not educate her on the current things

<otakon> ITS A MAHJONG PANEL!
<Randomnerd> It distracts viewers and is insulting to the Streamer.
<WindWhistler> Pinkies4thWall|AFK: I prefer the episode where James has to leave Chimecho behind. :'(
<otakon> *TILE
<Skylands> 10and they only fix it every once in a while, where you gotta refresh the entire page

<drf-Droid> http://shoptemp.net/products/Supercard-DSTWO.html
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MasterBoss43: Advice? Sure :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> The name "Nintendo" is often somewhat erroneously translated as "leave luck to heaven", "heaven blesses hard work", "in heaven's hands", or "work hard, but in the end it's in heaven's hands." A more literal translation is "The Hall of Entrusting Heaven" (Nin = Entrust Ten = Heaven Do = Hall or Meeting Place). A different, looser translation was given as "We work for the people to make the people happy" (from Nintendo Power magazine).
<Shamroc> otakon: well at least i went out to get hotdogs....they were good

<drf-Droid> there was DSi homebrew
<MasterBoss43> GJ*
<Phase4> 00,02it gets to a point were you're done with the game, mods can fix that
<Wrek> 05i mean imagine a party of 2 or 3 with maybe a companion using the difficulty crank aswell
<drf-Droid> but Team Cyclops died :c
<drf-Droid> so you need an un-updated DSi/3DS
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SB deserves victory for that dragoon dodge :P

<Spade-Magnes> What has you wait three days?
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<otakon> I don't need to check if file10001010101010 is up tod ate or not
<JESmith71> Well otakon there are those random system updates when you put new games in sometimes
<HyperMetalLugia> We don't use ZIP
<Wrek> 05outdated hardware, dragging down the quality of new games in general. PC to console and vice versa ports that are far from on par with each other. etc etc
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Besides, I like using controllers for shooters~
<Wrek> 05BUT
<JESmith71> ...but those aren't much of a big deal
<drf-Droid> hm
<Wrek> 05PCs have similar problem
