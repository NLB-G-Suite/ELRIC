<J_E_Smith71> TO BE CONTINUED....RIGHT NOW
<Lunacorn> so yeah.. no hub for me :<
<Mutterguy> Alright Simba's dad in the lion's King?
<otakon> AlienWarhead: no he's a Bull, I was talking about the pilot.

<oni_link> yay, its smooth playback now :3

<J_E_Smith71> SafariMonkey: Yes
<otakon> MadSurge: I've watched a LOT of these
<otakon> and that theme song
<otakon> :)
<AlienWarhead> otakon I thought you were quoting "Don't have a cow man"
<otakon> AlienWarhead: oh no :D
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: This version of the theme, or the older one?
<SafariMonkey> OK I'll watch from the start
<MadSurge> otakon: I watched Ducktales, but not DW :(
<otakon> J_E_Smith71: this version is the one I know or at least remember
<MadSurge> Dat 4th wall!
<oni_link> this was back when Disney was good :P
<otakon> MadSurge: they did a crossover with Gizmo Duck a lot too and Darkwing was very jealous of GD bc he was more famous
<otakon> Keen Gear
<otakon> Egg Shotgun
<MadSurge> otakon: the weird robot guy? :D
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: When the series showed up on Disney Channel before on Disney Afternoon the theme had a different singer and music

<Polydunami> Oh I see
<DashWithRainbows> Not a big fan of it.

<Lunar_Brony> superrretroworld therainbowvortex PeachStreak|drawing I was watching with my headphones on and she said "Are you watching My Litte Pony?!?" Immediately, I shut off my monitor and speakers, rushed over to her, grabbed her and said "You saw nothing. Don't you dare tell anyony about this. Okay?" She nodded with the huge grin on her face.

<DashWithRainbows> Polydunami You might as well get it.
<Lunacorn|Angry> Polydunami: easy solution: download it
<DashWithRainbows> Probably one of the best free things you can get.
<Polydunami> Oh, it's free?
<Cades> it signs you in automatically, so there's really no need to remember it
<DashWithRainbows> Yep.
<Lunacorn|Angry> Polydunami: it does have premium though
<Polydunami> But I thought some calls cost money
<therainbowvortex> Lunacorn|Angry: y r u angry
<PeachStreak|drawing> what are y'all talking about being free?
<DashWithRainbows> Well, you have to pay for group video calls. But normal voice group calls are free.
<Kimori> oh
<superrretroworld> Lunar_Brony: sorry bout that
<Polydunami> I mean, it's only a few cents but still
<Lunacorn|Angry> therainbowvortex: its complecated
<Kimori> You should write it down somewhere
<Cades> yeah
<therainbowvortex> Lunacorn|Angry: WILL A HUG HELP
<Polydunami> But the trouble for me is actually being able to pay the right way for that.
<Lunacorn|Angry> therainbowvortex: yes
<therainbowvortex> Lunar_Brony: is that it or is their more
*therainbowvortex hugs Lunacorn|Angry
<superrretroworld> Lunacorn|Angry: well sorry that your angry, hope you feel better :)
<DashWithRainbows> Polydunami You only pay for group video calls.
<Lunacorn|Angry> superrretroworld: thx :)
<DashWithRainbows> Normal calls are free, that goes for group calls as well.

<[Alpha]> I need to stop daydreaming so much
<Lunacorn|Angry> aww now erin is calling me on mah phone brb
<Lunar_Brony> therainbowvortex not much more to say on the matter. Basically, I just crashed into laughter and thought my life was over. Nobody in my family mentioned it until my jackass friend told them after I invited him over for dinner.
<Polydunami> Wait, DashWithRainbows, normal video calls are free?
<Kimori> One of these days ill get a ps3
<Lunacorn|Angry> Polydunami: yeah with one person/pony

<Lunar_Brony> regular Skype calls are free
<Lunacorn|Angry> Polydunami: but multi cost money
<Polydunami> I see
<Lunar_Brony> one-on-one chat is free
<DashWithRainbows> Polydunami Video calls with one person are free.
<therainbowvortex> Lunar_Brony: did your family judge you
<Lunacorn|Angry> erin is telling me not to be angry cause he is making muffins for me

<Stormy`> And make sure you're currently using whatever name you want registered
<twilight_sprinkle> SafariMonkey: i agreed with some of the things they said, but with none of their ways of proving it
<Lunacorn|Angry> therainbowvortex: no, thank you
<Lunacorn|Angry> lol erin is calling me again

<DerpyMuffins> Which I now have to make
<[SWAG]Haku> huh
<otakon> Domo: remember to give Sumica's that slight goth look :P
<Domo> x3

<Ghosties> 04Mummy ninja
<Ghosties> 04That's my human OC
<Stormy`> Yeah
<Spyrorocks`> Ill test it.
<Stormy`> It's just one guy right now though
<otakon> Ghosties: so you're Mack the Knife from Captain Commando?
<Lunar_Brony> seems legit
<Spyrorocks`> oh i mean, the general public
<[SWAG]Haku> YOur Oc is Ninja David Bowie?
<Spyrorocks`> can the general public post or make comments
<Ghosties> 04Wow, it's weird that you mentioned Mack the Knife since I'm listening to Bessie Jones
<Lunacorn|Joyful> yo has anypony seen brony2447 on?
<[SWAG]Haku> badass
<otakon> THE JEAN THAT IS VAL!
<otakon> looks too happy
<thelonepony> Lunacorn|Joyful: Nope
<cachi01> Lunacorn|Joyful: yeah like 5 hours ago
<AJIsAwesome_> Domo: Would you like some music requests? :)
<[SWAG]Haku> Val the Kacki Shorts
<Stormy`> Only if I manually change their user level in the database
<otakon> Domo: your logs are WAY behind, scroll down
<Lunacorn|Joyful> cachi01: really? he always seems to be off when im on and vice versa
<Ninjazz> Never has there been so many human OC's on one screen.
<[SWAG]Haku> "Gotts Make Them All Evil"
<otakon> wait
<Stormy`> haven't quite gotten around to implementing that yet since there's only like 1 user
<Spyrorocks`> ah ok
<Ghosties> 04Though, it'd be even MORE ironic if I were listening to Ella Fitzgerald, ota
<otakon> XD
<SpeccyRush> otakon: the stream itself is way behind

<Spyrorocks`> well lets have a look :)
<otakon> SpeccyRush: yeah but by 2 hours?
<otakon> Domo: where do you live? I think that is the issue here. I saw your timestamps at 23 where mine are 1
<Stormy`> how it works right now is anyone can register but you have to be given permission to post stuff to it
<Spyrorocks`> so "approved" users
<Stormy`> yeah
<DuskStarshimmer> pigns please
<SpeccyRush> well otakon how long ago did poly leave?

<Sumica> 00,10big breasted pirates
<Ghosties> 04I don't think Screen Savers would be that desperate
<Ghosties> 04At least not for attention
<Ghosties> 04They seemed really content with their niche show and viewership
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Sumica yeah! Big boobied Pirates...in...*Roy Mustang voice* TINY MINI SKIRTS :D
<Shizuka> 13i started writing off G4 in like 2007 when they kept replaying the same episode of beast wars every single day... never moved on to the rest of the season
<Sumica> 00,10I liked screan savers.
<Shizuka> 13we get it, code of hero was a touching ep, THERE WERE TWELVE OTHERS THAT SEASON

<Jmo> Nope
*Vivix hits
<Jmo> NOP
<Jmo> DERPY HAS WINGS, NOTHING ELSE.
<Vivix> Narhwales are cool, beacuse- they look so otherworldy
<Vivix> !
*Gold_Demona thinks Jmo is awesome. <--(try disagreeing with that one)
<Vivix> Imagine it!
<Jmo> I disagree.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> Jmo is uncool!?
*Lunacorn|Joyful tries disagreeing..head explodes
*Vivix sits at the cool kid's table
<Jmo> Oh well.
<Jmo> Doesn't bother me :3
*Snow throws Vivix away from the table
<Snow> my table
<Vivix> Ah damnit...foiled again
*Gold_Demona tries to sit at the cool kids table... Is repelled by nerdiness
<Jmo> Haah.
<Jmo> Declind
<Jmo> Declined*
<Gold_Demona> I'm too nerdy for the cool kids table. :<
<Vivix> We'll make a cool nerds table
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~ 8D
<Snow> More snoipers
*Gold_Demona sits at the cool nerds table. :>
<Snow> i lolled xD
<Vivix> the cool nerds table, with a built in slot for the dungeon master's rulebooks and folders. Or maybe that's just the nerd table
<Jmo> That's the DnD table.
*Gold_Demona never played tabletop RPGs, sadly...
*Vivix eats outside, simpler that way
<Jmo> I wanna get into Wh40k TT but tis expensive.
<Vivix> I've only done it a few times- it's surprisingly fun
<Vivix> getting into DnD costs a sheet of paper and a good DM
<Jmo> Hitting Vivix costs nothing.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> yes it does! It costs friendship credit
<Gold_Demona> I'd like to play one, cuz they seem like so much fun
<Jmo> We never had a friendship to begin with. D:
<Gold_Demona> ;,
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> so betrayed
<Gold_Demona> :<
<Jmo> Bwahahaha
<Vivix> but yeah, I wish I knew people who played it, only played it a few times with my cousins big brother and his dnd friends when I was a kid
<Jmo> You were a child once?
<Vivix> I know eh some anime shops and other nerd shops around here have DnD clubs, but- way too shy
<Jmo> I thought you were a demon spawn.
*Jmo shrugs
*Vivix nods
<Vivix> A demonchild
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't want to play with strangers. :<
<Jmo> See, I had my reasons to bash you.
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> I'm not social enough for that.
<Vivix> Yeah- I think it's best with friends, since it's sooo social, you know- acting and stuff
<Gold_Demona> It's most of the reason I don't regularly play TF2
<Gold_Demona> I don't like playing if I don't know anybody
<XAX> Jmo: You bash pretty much everything :<
<Jmo> ikr?
<Vivix> Ah yeah- I'm kinda the same there, I prefer to play with someone I know
<Jmo> I haven't bashed Dema though.

<Jmo> It's in the corner rocking back and forth telling itself it'll return someday.
<Gold_Demona> I draw frickin' Gargoyles crossovers. I draw charaters as gargoyles that have no business being gargoyles. o_o
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> And write fanfics about them
<Vivix> Aah, the fun of creativity
<Vivix> Sanity is playing punk music and living in sheds in the woods going "The system sucks, man"
<Gold_Demona> Well, I used to write fanfics about them. My muse seems to have abandoned me, and I haven't been able to write anything since. >.>
<Jmo> <.<
<Vivix> Aw, writing is fun- but yeah, it comes and goes
<Jmo> Too bad you can't write Vivix.
<Jmo> :3

<Gold_Demona> Haven't played scout enough to have a favorite weapon. :P
<Buytoast> but the default strange scattergun is suprerior
<Vivix> When you make a workshop weapon, are you allowed to fiddle with the code?
<Snow> soda popper+flying guilotuine+sandman=my loadout and it owns on VSH
<Vivix> I think my loadout is standard everything- despite having had the game for years and years and years
<Snow> average damage on hale in one life is 1200 dmg
<Snow> unless he does a noob rage on me >.>
*Vivix has no idea what any of that means

*AdamTheDuck licks Vivix
*Vivix sucks on Adam
<Snow> that means he does a rage on Just you
<Vivix> Not sure who hale is- event?
<Snow> its a custom mod
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, it's a game mode
<Vivix> Ah
<Vivix> Looking at my stats-
<Snow> one guy versus a whole team
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, think one super player vs everyone else
<XylemTube> Vivix: what do you mean by "the code"
<Vivix> 5 hours on record- bought it when it came out-
<Vivix> you know, the code for the weapon. Or is it just model?
<SpeccyRush> woooo finally made it through the island
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, Phase usually plays Pony Heroes or something where one player gets a pony model and has to kill everyone else
<Vivix> since it's multiplayer and all, I mean
<Vivix> AdamTheDuck, ahh
<Vivix> I've seen that, but never knew what it was
<SpeccyRush> Phase4: sell that sniper soul to some one else
<XylemTube> Vivix: Well if you mean change the weapon's stats, then no. that's up to valve. What I'm making is a skin

<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast, it's a misc item that turns you into a zombie
<XylemTube> the*

<Gold_Demona> Would you rather be cooked Jmo?
<Jmo> I JUST DON'T
<Jmo> NO.
<Jmo> BUT
<diddutz> Phase4: So what does "2.33" mean exactly (i never really traded and stuff)
<Serenity> Phase4: For some bizzare reason, demand went up
<Cypresswolf> And the trencher we rented was delivered without a gaurd for the chain - if a safety inspector sees that, the rental company gets in trouble
<Snow> i little
<Serenity> diddutz: I'll tell you
<Snow> a little*
<diddutz> I'm listening :3
<Serenity> 2 is 2 reclaimed, and .33/.66/1 are reclaimed
<Serenity> 2 refined*
<Serenity> So 2.66 is 2 refined and 2 reclaimed
<Serenity> Phase4: Do ya want a reclaimed?
<diddutz> and scrap metad just doesnt count in at all?
<Jmo> .-.
<Serenity> diddutz: Scrap metal is .16
<Phase4> Serenity, free?
<Serenity> Phase4: If you can't afford to give me anything, yeah, free
<Serenity> I think it's 2 scrap = 1 rec
<diddutz> Serenity: okay thx
<AdamTheDuck> Isn't it 3 scrap?

<Phase4> wonder if i shouldnt reduce the ones i have stranges of
<Phase4> i've been keeping around normals but tbh i never use
<Serenity> Phase4: Keep 1 of each decent weapon, and bin the rest

<Serenity> Mine is something like OVER 9000

<Gold_Demona> lol I played the James Bond theme with the character select. XD

<Blako> o.o
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, Malavolent. :)
<Blako> hi
<Malavolent> What is this TF halloween update all about?
<naturesfury> buenos dias everyone :)
<AJIsAwesome> I think it's about the new comic that's been released. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Also, hi naturesfury! :)
<Malavolent> But there's some new stuff in game too.
<artist> hello
<AJIsAwesome> There have been some new features added for only a short time, but that's all I know.
<AJIsAwesome> Also, hello artist. :)
<Vivix> it's a yearly event
<Vivix> it only lasts a few days-
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<naturesfury> o hello artist
<Jmo> A few days?
<Jmo> LOl
<alexxm> how are things naturesfury
*Vivix shrugs
<Jmo> Few weeks more like
<artist> so....TF2?
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't played TF2, so I wouldn't really know. :D
<Vivix> few weeks?
<naturesfury> is tf2 free to play now?
<Vivix> I only play it once in a while
<Vivix> so--this is first time in a bot a year
<Snow> yes it is
<naturesfury> hmm
<naturesfury> still would rather play bf3
<Snow> its been free like 2012 i thought?
<artist> i never really understood tf .....
<naturesfury> 2 bad all bronies rather play tf2 :/
<Snow> 2010*
<Vivix> I think it turned free in 2010 yeah
<Vivix> I played BF3 when it came out-
<Vivix> but--didn't really like it
<artist> naturesfury: psssst....im a brony who like bf3.....psssst
<AJIsAwesome> I think I'd honestly have more fun playing TF2 than BF3.
<Vivix> not that I'm a big TF2 fan either, but- fun once in a while
<naturesfury> whos the bad shot with the shotgun here?
<naturesfury> lawl
*Vivix get's distracted by irc, gets murdered
<AJIsAwesome> It's Phase.
<Snow> omw
<MadSurge> http://misteralex.net/misc/images/my_little_pwniez_rock_band_3_th.jpg :D no Pinkie or Twilight though :(
<naturesfury> artist u play bf3 on pc?
<Snow> and ill be unboxing that thingie there
<artist> naturesfury: no, i cant afford a good gaming pc, i have it on ps3
<naturesfury> ahhh :'(
<artist> i dont really like pc controls either
<artist> feels wrong once you've held a controller
<Vivix> Opposite here artist
<naturesfury> same
<naturesfury> i cant do fps with controlers
<artist> Vivix: i've heard it's much harder getting good at playing games on pc, then with controllers
<Vivix> GTA is fun with controllers, but even there, on the gta after san andreas, I prefer PC
<Vivix> I've heard the opposite, but I don't play to get good
<artist> Vivix: a friend of mine, wich has an xbox, was invited to play with the best COD team
<artist> optic
<Vivix> It's not impossible
<naturesfury> how many kills he get?
<Vivix> but there's no real difference between how hard it is to learn
<Vivix> there's a cap where APM and Accuracy is--less possible on a controller, but who cares?
<Rex_Mundi> So is 'Hurricane Fluttershy' pretty much every flutterdash shippers favorite episode?
<alexxm> i guess so
<artist> i just prefer controllers,i dont fit in here <_<
<naturesfury> haha
<Vivix> It's okay, noone minds
<Vivix> I don't ship Fluttershy and Dash, but--it's a great friendshipping episode between them at least
<Rex_Mundi> "friendshipping"- ayup!
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, I'm not into shipping but the one shippping I find okay is friendshipping.
<artist> what are you talking about Vivix ?
<BaconMane> 0,5The only person who will do any shipping around here is otakon
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, BaconMane. :D
<Vivix> I think my--current Fluttershy ship is eh...probably Flutterlight
<Phase4> yohai BaconMane
<Vivix> artist was responding to Rex_Mundi
<BaconMane> 0,5"flutterlight"
<BaconMane> 0,5how creative
<Vivix> Well, it's not creative
<BaconMane> 0,5TwiShy
<Vivix> but it's an easy description rather than two names
<BaconMane> 0,5see it rhymes
<BaconMane> 0,5that's creative
<Vivix> Kiiinda rhymes
<Vivix> Did you know that Orange Ocean is a rhyme?
<BaconMane> 0,5Doooes rhyme
<Chrysalis> how some people can't understand "no guns" is beyond me
<artist> phase is so suicidal
<Vivix> I kinda zoned out due to chat
<BaconMane> 0,5Oh god not a gun conversation again
<Vivix> in game baconmane
<Serenity> Yeah. over half the server is pissed off, so yeah
<Chrysalis> BaconMane we were trying to farm haunted metal
<artist> why is peoplle mad?
<Vivix> but yeah shipping- I've gotten affinity for things like, someone mentioned to me, and I can't get it out of my head: Twilight and Lyra
<Chrysalis> we lost 4 because of people not listening
<Vivix> We're trying to meelee the hhh, but people keep shooting him I think
<Serenity> We were trying to get metal, but some nob head decideds to gun and kill
<Serenity> So yeah, not in the brightest of moods
<artist> thats a shitload of tabs
<Vivix> I don't really care SErenity
<Rex_Mundi> SMOOZE
<SpeccyRush> yeah Phase4 thanks for the server but ya need to enforce melle only
<Phase4> and then firefox broke
<Phase4> SpeccyRush, would be good but i don't know how :(
<Serenity> Vivix: It's alright, I don't care either
<Phase4> even better if i could reduce the spawn time
<SpeccyRush> or if they dont listen kick Phase4 simple
<Serenity> Phase4: I think you could do it in some server mods
<Phase4> ok, seems that its broken
<Vivix> check ou the server.cfg settings and such
<Phase4> so no outro video
<Serenity> I know there's deffosome server stuff that allows you to spawn him
<MadSurge> Aww
<Vivix> I don't know if --TF2 likes that
<Gold_Demona> Well that was fun. :>
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw here is link
<infernap> my bad
<Phase4> is almost as good
<Vivix> Yuss, was fun
<infernap> didnt know we were meleeing
<SpeccyRush> I died only 3 times to the horsemen every other time was a shootable weapon
<Phase4> infernap, we kept tellign you in chat :P
<Jmo> o.O
<naturesfury> herpderp
<Chrysalis> infernap can you not read gamechat
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, that last kill it isaid was yours, you get anything?
*Jmo pokes Snow
<infernap> i may or may not have been too focused on the game
<Kandarihu> Thanks to Scream Fortress 2, this might be the only time TF2 is shown on the stream witout setting off my fasting rule.
<SpeccyRush> Bullshit infernap
<infernap> honest
<Gold_Demona> I don't think so
<Gold_Demona> I'm not really sure
<Jmo> T'was fun.
<Vivix> T'were indeed
<Gold_Demona> I got a couple boxes out of this, so that's pretty cool. Got nothing to open them, but hey. Boxes. :P
<Kandarihu> So thanks for streaming.
<SpeccyRush> Twas anger inducing is what it was
<Vivix> Only if you let it
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, Phase4 for the stream. :)
<LightTrooper105> i was having so much fun with my demoman :3
<Jmo> Anger inducing?
<Jmo> How?
<Serenity> I got 1 pressie, so not as lucky as you was
<naturesfury> sounds like hes letting it
<BaconMane> 0,5So guys, quick reminder of the art contest deadline coming soon!
<Vivix> Someone used guns instead of meelee
<Vivix> Art! Woo
<LightTrooper105> i notice
<infernap> again, my bad
<Vivix> I didn't really mind- but I wasn't focusing
<Jmo> It's alright infernap

<infernap> so, now what do we do
*Vivix purrs
<CountDoofus> Actually, no. I trace, which isn't drawng. If I were to draw something for real, you'd say "Damn, a five year old can do better than this" :p
<BaconMane> 0,5You don't have to be an exellent artist to enter :P
<Snow> yeah yeah
<Phase4> Serenity, yeah. 2.66 refined and it was like instatrade
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: True. :P

<Snow> im busy trying to get in
*Jmo hugs Snow
<Jmo> We finished :<
<LightTrooper105> i would enter but I dont want too
<Gold_Demona> It's really funny because I'm pretty sure I'm sucking horribly at TF2, but it doesn't really feel like it. :P
<artist> BaconMane: dont unnecessery ping me! its horrible
<Phase4> i got strange shovel
<Vivix> TF2 makes you feel good, somehow
<Snow> well, im not a good artist myself D:

<Gold_Demona> Right under SMW that is
<MadSurge> ekips: I prefer Super Mario World
<naturesfury> im starting to rly see alot of youtube vids with jap writing in em. is it getting rly popular over there now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, Japan doing PMV now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELP
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer SMW.
<Gold_Demona> Mario 3 comes a very close second to Mario World
<CrimsonPhoenix> Next thing we'll know well see a Pony song being SMW leveled
<Tervicz> I just introduced my parents to ponies...
<Gold_Demona> brb gonna go make lunch
<AJIsAwesome> And how did it go, Tervicz?
<naturesfury> how it go Tervicz?
<ekips> SM World was the second best imo. But I might be biased to 3 since I played that my whole childhood and World only a few months ago^^
<Tervicz> Not bad, I used the pony Polka's
<Tervicz> Dad wanted to show off his new TV which does internet
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, that last bit of the video makes the whole thing for me
<infernap12> haha
<Tervicz> So I gave him a clip
<Tervicz> Will have to wait for the result, I don't live with my parents
<Tervicz> I mailed him all 7 polka vids
<infernap12> he'll prob think its just a joke
<naturesfury> ^
<Tervicz> Maybe
<CrimsonPhoenix> I wonder when we'll have this in Pony song now http://youtu.be/ia1mb0srRA8

<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: It sure is. :D
<Tervicz> Well there is only one PMV which does" a horse with no name"
<Tervicz> That would be cool
<Tervicz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhsRx3jBzk
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: good news, Luna has a rockin' italian voice too :$
<Tervicz> Here it is, crappy animation though

<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Serenity> Jmo: By me
<naturesfury> with science!
<Jmo> Combustible lemons.
<Jmo> Everywhere.
<RainbowDerp1> CURSE YOU LOADING SCREEN
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: not really :(
<Serenity> I know that Either Sum'i or Phas'e wouldn't slaughter me :]
<Cypresswolf> Looking at the address of the Marriot to hold Fiesta Equestria - I know exactly where it - One of my most frequent delivery destinations is just down the street from it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Nice! :)
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: wait, nevermind! :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brpWy1UKMA8&list=UUdbc75o0Q4_eKHdyIAHw8IQ&index=1&feature=plcp
<Jmo> Needs more smiles.
<Rex_Mundi> Since we are talking about dubs, the Russian dub is overall nothing special, but Russian "at the Gala" is one of the best versions. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teeT3PlWd7M
<Serenity> Wait wait wait
<BarbThePopUp> I have pics of myself with strange women, and I now have a tattoo claiming my undieing love for a "Lasuanda." I not longer have my civic either, its now a bicycle with a motor, and a card that hits the spokes just right.
<Serenity> Italian Boomerang has MLP, but British boomerang DOESN'T
<BarbThePopUp> Hm...
<BarbThePopUp> Oh. Weekend before halloween.
<naturesfury> wow when she yelling and not yelling is rely diferent sounding
<MadSurge> Serenity: Ikr
<BarbThePopUp> Time for damage control.
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to set up a group to attend - I can book the room far in advance then try to get as many the hotel will allow (at least 4)
<BarbThePopUp> Equestria Fiesta or whatever?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<BarbThePopUp> =P
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is still the best opening http://youtu.be/7dchiYx5Hzo
<alexxm> so are we having a horror movie marathon on halloween or something
<MadSurge> alexxm: I hope so!
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: Luna awesome!
<Cypresswolf> :) my first convention - A-Kon 2004, we had 12 people in the room - people sleeping under the sink, in front of the door, in the arm chair, on the counter...:D - still surprised we got away with it - the cleaning crew had NO idea
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: Ikr :$
<Cypresswolf> BarbThePopUp: for Fiesta Equestria
<AJIsAwesome> I like both openings, but I prefer the original one.
<infernap12> is that opening official or fan made?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: and the Twi VA did a good job on freaking out in Lesson Zero :D
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: That's awesome. :D
<Serenity> alexxm: Mabye the Mods have to play horror games like Cry of Fear and whenever
<Rex_Mundi> I want to hear Celestia talk in the Royal Canterlot voice
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: I would actually like to hear that too. :D
<alexxm> whats cry of fear Serenity
<ekips> I don't think she will ever do that Rex_Mundi
<Tervicz> They should do a dynasty episode some day...
<naturesfury> if spike uses the royal canterlot voice dose he become dovakin?
<Tervicz> With the royals
<naturesfury> just wondering
<AJIsAwesome> naturesfury: I see what you did there. :P
<Cypresswolf> usually the max per room in 4 - I think I can get away with a few more...:) 600 rooms in that place, they cant keep track of how many people per room
<Rex_Mundi> ekips: but wouldnt it be so awesome and intimidating?
<Gold_Demona> Fus Ro Spike?
<Serenity> alexxm: A HORROR GAME :3
<infernap12> but spike himself is a dragon
<Serenity> Basically some random teenager has gone batshit insane
<alexxm> whats it about Serenity
<infernap12> dovakin is dragon slayer
<Serenity> And you have to FIGHT MONSTUHZ
<Snow> spike = dragon so he is practicly dragonborn
<ekips> Rex_Mundi slightly out if character though imo.
<Cypresswolf> I'll set a reservation by somewhere in December
<Snow> your arguments are invalid
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and in italian, the fun has been indeed doubled :$
<ekips> out of*
<AJIsAwesome> infernap12: The pun is him being "dragonborn".
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol :D

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no really, it's been translated as that :D

<AJIsAwesome> BarbThePopUp: Daww :D

<CrimsonPhoenix> wait.....oh I'm dumb
<RustyMeat> hay guys
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi RustyMeat and Panda
<CriticKitten> ASoftFluffyThing: And hopefully they'll never stop doing it. I remember hearing an ad on my radio announcing that the last Riverdance tour would probably be their final one, and I was like "wait wut ;_;"
<Shammy> dat crysis~
<Panda> omg, a soft and fluffy thing!!!!
<thelonepony> Hi RustyMeat :)
<Panda> must lay on it!

<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: I know, right? :(
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, Jmo?
<Jmo> It's all your fault .-.
<AJIsAwesome> Wait
<AJIsAwesome> How?
<Jmo> Dunno, just is.
<Jmo> :>
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten, I hope TSO comes back to where I'm living. I really do. Like a couple years ago when they were coming here they were doing a drawing for it. My mom bought two tickets for me cause she knows I was looking forward
<AJIsAwesome> ;~;
<CriticKitten> Would be heart-breaking if Trans-Siberian Orchestra ever stopped their Christmas music tradition. ;_;
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten, don't you DARE say that. Ever.
<CriticKitten> LOL
<CriticKitten> His face. XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Well since all the Christmas stuff is coming out (and it's barely the day before Halloween), I'm sure Walmart/Target/Kmart/Best Buy will have the Trans-Siberian Orchestra CD's out.
<CriticKitten> ASoftFluffyThing: It's sad, but you know, they might one day have to.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten, let's hope it no time soon. I'm gonna cry when that day comes.
<CriticKitten> No kidding. Some traditions just shouldn't end. Especially music and dance.
<DaringDerpy> audio is a bit earlier than video
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<pikorar> Hello everypony! Long time no talk, I hope you're all having a nice day, because I am. Got Netflix 2 days ago, and I already watched every Doctor Who episode since 2005, no lie, it's been awesome. I love you all!

<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: No, I said Chrono Cross. :P
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: chrono trigger is far surperior
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I won't argue that, but you have to admit Chrono Cross had some kickass music.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i never played chrono cross, but i heard decent things about it
<Gold_Demona> I really like it. Mostly because I played Cross first.
<Bronysith> what?
<Bronysith> but Chrono trigger is one of the best JRPGs ever
<Cypresswolf> Linking Books <3
<Bronysith> if not the best
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I didn't know about Chrono Trigger until after I played Chrono Cross.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: well at least you recognize the surperioty of trigger
<Bronysith> considering everytime someone mentions chrono trigger i fanboygasm
<DerpyMuffins> Arent you a little old to be playing in the sand Shizuka?

<AJIsAwesome> .......
<Brenna_Hooves> What is this Minecraft? (is that phrased right?)

<Gold_Demona> Bronysith totally missing MadSurge's point

<Sir_Dark_Horst> Shizuka: i have no idea what you jsut said^^
<Ponies47> nyansonic: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7697/

<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: :D
<Chrysalis> and dense ores can stack, and their instability stacks too, so you can make worlds with CRAZY amounts of resources
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: does finding dense ores require a certain combination of words?
<Chrysalis> but they decay very quickly
<Shizuka> 13it's random
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome to Bronystate, nyansonic. Make sure to read the rules. :D
<Chrysalis> Cypresswolf its a word in itself

<thelonepony> SeaponiesofLiverpool: I love Bungies :3
<DaringDerpy> looks good, SeaponiesofLiverpool
<Jmo> Bungies.

<Chrysalis> Shizuka thats decay
<DaringDerpy> the dynamite gods are not pleased
<Chrysalis> where the grass has dropped
<DaringDerpy> decay?
<Cypresswolf> emerald green sky is awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, it looks very amaturish but with a bit of potential
<SpeccyRush> Chrysalis: ya forgot an s in you sentences
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I drew it in MSPaint
<SpeccyRush> your*
<Jmo> MSPaint. Hardcore.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I cannot say it's good but I believe you are capable of more
<Jmo> Tis a good job for MSPaint tbh
<Tailsy> haax
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I've seen some great stuff from Paint tbh
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Bamboo Tablet
<Chrysalis> if your gonna cheat
<Chrysalis> at least do it properly
<Chrysalis> with EE toys
<Jmo> Woop Wacom.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Woop
<Shizuka> 13you cheat the way you want
<Shizuka> 13i cheat the way i want :3
<DaringDerpy> reported to video game police
<Chrysalis> with low explosives?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> JUMP
<Shizuka> 13yes :)
<Chrysalis> pssst, nuke it
<Cypresswolf> Shizu sleeps on cliff edges - with NO railings!
<Hat_Brovakiin> why not high explosives :3
<Chrysalis> Hat_Brovakiin you lose resources
<CrimsonPhoenix> Here's an easy guess game. What episode is this gif from? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcm9m91GSZ1r5el02o1_500.gif
<Shizuka> 13cause the nuke kills stream
<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: Your sleeping next to a MASSIVE hole in the ground that if you fell through would indeffinetly kill you?
<Tailsy> no rules to follow they said, no one can tell you what you can or cannot do they said. "you can only sleep at night" it said
<Chrysalis> Mega_Milk wouldnt kill
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> JUMP
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> do it
<Chrysalis> thats a star fissure
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> you have parachute
<Chrysalis> if you jump
<Chrysalis> you go to overworld
<Tailsy> mojang you so silly
<DaringDerpy> CrimsonPhoenix: I have no idea
<SpeccyRush> hypothetical question, what would Doctor Whooves dress up as for nightmare night?
<Mega_Milk> Chrysalis: So this isnt a mod?
<Chrysalis> Tailsy this is a mod, not mojang
<Hat_Brovakiin> Chrysalis: Not with the nova catalyst you don't
<Chrysalis> Mega_Milk this is a mod pack
<Chrysalis> this is many mods
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> a Dalek
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Putting your hoof down?
<Chrysalis> Hat_Brovakiin i already suggested EE toys
<Hat_Brovakiin> true
<Shizuka> 13fiiiine
<Mega_Milk> Chrysalis: So like the regular game if you fall from to high you take fall damage.
<Cypresswolf> Mega_Milk: She can subconsciously sense danger and open here linking book in here sleep
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, good job, bonus point if you can specify the scene
<Chrysalis> Mega_Milk you dont fall onto ground though
<Hat_Brovakiin> what about laser guns? :3
<Chrysalis> that hole is into a star fissure
<SpeccyRush> SeaponiesofLiverpool: for lulz or the something more ironic
<Cypresswolf> True Story!
<Tailsy> Chrysalis: i know. refer to the post before that one
<Mega_Milk> Chrysalis: What is a star fissure?
<flutterchu> holy s6_9t
<Chrysalis> Mega_Milk from mystcraft, they are used as one way transport back to the overworld
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Nightmare Night... Doctor and the Derpy switch bodies
<Tailsy> RUN
<flutterchu> i nearly have 50 subscriber's
<Ponies47> O.O
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: The scene where the mare cuts in front of her and denies it?
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Tailsy> damn that was big
*Mega_Milk hugs flutterchu
<Chrysalis> look at all that decay
<Mega_Milk> Chrysalis: So this isnt the over world?
<AJIsAwesome> In Sugarcube Corner.
<Chrysalis> and all that LAG
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, you're good, and I'd like to call that scene "the line"
<Chrysalis> Mega_Milk no, this is an age from mystcraft
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<Chrysalis> a customisable world
<SpeccyRush> SeaponiesofLiverpool: sounds like an interesting fanfic idea, but im just talking bout costumes
<Tailsy> cat
<Tailsy> by c418
<Mega_Milk> Chrysalis: So this isnt even minecraft?? Its something else?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, but you're good
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
<Tailsy> a good song
<CrimsonPhoenix> I might start taking screenshots and makes you guys guess
<Chrysalis> this is a mod in minecraft
<CrimsonPhoenix> sounds fun
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: It'll be a nice challenge. Please do whenever you get the chance. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have this theory that many can tell the episode from only one frame
<Lyra|inbed> hmm
<Lyra|inbed> it looks like minecrat
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Derpy ina Doctor Costume, and Doctor in a Derpy costume
<Tailsy> haaax
<CrimsonPhoenix> given enough information in the picture of course
<Lyra|inbed> and that avitar looks like Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> SeaponiesofLiverpool: :D
<Lyra|inbed> using deductive reasoning, Shizuka is streaming
<Lyra|inbed> and this is tekkit
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :)
<Tailsy> dat pig
<AJIsAwesome> A pig? :D
<Chrysalis> damn connection drop?

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that second movie should be rechosen due to the overabundance of tentacle hentai jokes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well as a request I have to picture to make you guys guess. http://i.imgur.com/P4542.png
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and that its not a very good movie
<Brony2447> ohai bronystate!
<Panda|LOL> What is tekkit?

<thelonepony> Ohai Brony2447 :3
<Lunacorn|Joyful> Brony2447: hey errin!
<CrimsonPhoenix> by that I mean
<Lunacorn|Joyful> *erin
<AJIsAwesome> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Implying that everyone is immature enough to make said jokes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Can you guess the episode in which this picture is from? http://i.imgur.com/P4542.png
<Mega_Milk> Well....
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Ticket Master?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> >implying everyone isn't
<Mega_Milk> that was interesintg.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, You're just too good to be true
<SpeccyRush> motherfucker
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> plus its on every week on the Syfy channel
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I mean EVERY week
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm just anylyzing the scene. It's not that hard, really. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *anylizing
<CrimsonPhoenix> We thought it might be harder since it's a small portion
<AJIsAwesome> *analyzing
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I did hesitate to tell you the truth
<AJIsAwesome> Gah, I can not spell today. :P
<Shizuka> 13got enough to keep my macerators going for a while :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Macerator?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> is that like Subjuggulators?
<Brony2447> macerators.. isnt that part of a minecraft mod?
<Chrysalis_> Macerators grind down ore into dust, effectively doubling the yeild
<AJIsAwesome> It seperates materials by soaking them, correct?
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<AJIsAwesome> Nvm then.
<Chrysalis_> Brony2447 yup, Industrial Craft
<AJIsAwesome> I'm thinking of macerate.
<Brony2447> Chrysalis_: ahh ok thx :)
<Chrysalis_> though Factorisation seems to be taking over from industrial craft
<Chrysalis_> offers a triple yield method
<Chrysalis_> which takes a couple stages
<Chrysalis_> far more interesting
<Lunacorn|Joyful> ohai CrimsonPhoenix, brony2447 told me about you too :D
<Brony2447> that i did
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why hello Lunacorn|Joyful
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why did this fellow pony told you about me?
<Lunacorn|Joyful> CrimsonPhoenix: he said that you were a rule stresser
<Brony2447> among other things :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Now that's just wrong.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm the bad guy of Bronystate
<CrimsonPhoenix> everybody knows that
<AJIsAwesome> He sure is. <_<
<Brony2447> CrimsonPhoenix:suuuure
<AJIsAwesome> >_>
<thelonepony> eeyup he is >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> but really I'm not as much of a rulestresser as Caramel
<SpeccyRush> CrimsonPhoenix: speak of the devil man
<Lunacorn|Joyful> CrimsonPhoenix: well ive always been a rule stresser myself
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh good, have you read the rules?
<Brony2447> tis true, Lunacorn|Joyful
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Faqs and about us?

<thelonepony> Drawfriend number 3: /)^3^(\
<Alchemist> DaringDerpy: basically you have 2 actions per round for every soldier. You can move twice, or shoot once. Or move once and shoot once. there are special moves. What you have seen is the special move called "overwatch". Your soldier will only take a reaction shot if you end your turn by choosing this action.
<DaringDerpy> https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NVNmaIlXSeM/UI2G3Nnc3MI/AAAAAAAAKWk/tK7_WdrClAU/s1600/LyrasSong.png

<Alchemist> I always thought it was liie offline minecraft, just with more people, thats why I've never tried it.
<Lil_B> Lunacorn|Joyful yes
<Lunacorn|Joyful> i hate greifing :<
<Serenity> Alchemist: Most of the time, it is. Unless you mod the server
<Lunacorn|Joyful> to be honest every server ive EVER been on i was greifed just for being a brony :(
<Serenity> Lunacorn|Joyful: Can't blame them. Bronies are fucktards.

<Celestia`s_Bunny> I just taped my ipad to my computer screen
<Brony2447|Pissed> AJIsAwesome: nope
<AJIsAwesome> Brony2447|Pissed: Why?
<Alchemist> Brony2447|Pissed: whats up, are at your friend's?
<Brony2447|Pissed> Alchemist: yeah
<Alchemist> whats wrong?
<Brony2447|Pissed> ehh.. someone sent the most heartless email ive ever seen to my friend here and now he is in the restroom doing godknowswhat
<AdamTheDuck> Good morrow ded chat
<oni_link> ello AdamTheDuck
<AJIsAwesome> Brony2447|Pissed: Oh my. That's terrible. :S
<Brony2447|Pissed> AJIsAwesome: yeah..
<Brovakiininabox> Heya AdamTheDuck
<Serenity> Brony2447|Pissed: Welcome to the internet, where people can be heartless as possible without the worry of getting assassinated
<Celestia`s_Bunny> anime has the most akward moments ever
<Alchemist> was it someone he knows or just a random person?
<oni_link> I'll bbl
<Brony2447|Pissed> Serenity: im sorry but that was just a douchy thing to say right now, i dont want to hear it
<Brovakiininabox> Bye oni- and gone
<Serenity> Brony2447|Pissed: Sorry. I didn't mean it like that, but you knew what I meant.
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity does have a point, though. The internet is full of cruel people and heartless people sometimes.
<Celestia`s_Bunny> seriously, anime shows have the most awkward moments
<AdamTheDuck> Funny, there was this story of this one school girl who got arrested for making a death threat on the internet.
<Alchemist> Well its easy to get rid of one's frustration and anger on people you dont know anonymously.
<AJIsAwesome> But don't let it get to you. You really shouldn't. You'd only be letting he/she win.
<Serenity> AdamTheDuck: She was probably reported
<flutterchu> is there a stream?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<Brony2447|Pissed> ill be right back my friend needs band-aids
<thelonepony> no
<AdamTheDuck> Serenity, nah she did it on Facebook
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Alchemist: I just shoot birds to get rid of my frustration
<flutterchu> thoin i can just sit back relex and link videos
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg5QBrwKF94
<Serenity> AdamTheDuck: That's why then. Pedobook is full of people who are goody with the law
<Alchemist> Celestia`s_Bunny: thats one way.
<Alchemist> flutterchu: that was...random
<AdamTheDuck> http://derpy.me/ULcDp

<Yahooz> >second largest hurricane
<Yahooz> Maybe to reach new York
<Michael> nopenopenope
<DerpyMuffins> Would it be considered paranoia if you have a bomb shelter in your basement?
<Shizuka> 13 Since records of storm size began in 1988, only one tropical storm or hurricane has been larger--Tropical Storm Olga of 2001, which had a 690 mile radius of tropical storm-force winds when it was near Bermuda
<Yahooz> oh as in size
<Shizuka> 13DerpyMuffins: no just means your house was built or modified in the 50s
<Yahooz> i thought magnitude :p
<DerpyMuffins> Alright that helps
<Celestia`s_Bunny> DerpyMuffins: nope
<Blako> gtg, bye

<Domo> Is this an ADV dub or Funimation?
<J_E_Smith71> Or at least make it safety glass, or fiberglass, or plexiglass
<Buytoast> that way it'll turn into glass
<Brovakiininabox> use plastic, all the kids are doing it
<AJIsAwesome> Domo: I think Funimation.
