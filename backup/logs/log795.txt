<magmablock> 9/10. What can I say? It's a classic. It takes a bit for things to get going, but once it does, it doesn't let up. Characters are a tad flat, but better than most action flicks.

<Vordox> Fun Trivia, alternative: In the original script, Gennaro and Malcolm were combined into one character, and Muldoon survived in the end. In the original book, Gennaro and Muldoon both survived, and Hammond and Malcolm died (though Malcolm returned in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, explaining that "doctors did excellent work").

<Bright_Shadow> Hah, budget was $63 Million
<Copperhead> I actually really like Rat Race. Especially the part with with the accidental nazis
<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of JURASSIC PARK: While i know this could've been taken a little more serious, then again it shouldn't. This movie has just the characters portrayed very well, the soundtrack is epic, and it has an undeniable effect of CINEMA of using CGI at a large scale to this day However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout
<CloverPatch> ^
<Fl00t4sh41> after the credits
<MusicalSlyp> BEST SONG EVAR!!!
<tavi_lover7> how do you mention someone in a comment
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka I really like Jurrasic Park 3 :P

<Crown95> If it's in a book just take a look.
<weylin|Blarg> Zimmer is repetitive
*hidden_pony tackles Fl00t4sh41
<Vordox> Fun Trivia, repeating a FUN fact: Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics meant Nintendo type cartoon quality. He originally only wanted the herd of gallimimus dinosaurs to be computer-generated, but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of a T-rex chasing a herd of galamides across his ranch, he decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. The animation was first plotted on an Amiga Toaster,

<IshCleverGirl> John_Williams no
<MusicalSlyp> fail
<Kyrzar> Testing out your talents on a farm? Better try to read minds...
<Fluffysaurus_Rex> because they maintain their good looks with constant massages and sauna trips
<GarrettBrony> this scene reminds me of the open to ghostbusters
<Jigglysaint> only thing I hated about the movie was that it used Who Let The Dogs Out, which I despise
<DocSane> Fl00t4sh41: I like how AJ seems to be Rarity's closest friend now.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: because you're attracted to them
<brony655321> Also John Lovitz

<MusicalSlyp> Wat? would their cutie marks be cards?
<OohShiny> Sweetie's eyes
<GarrettBrony> OMG am I a phichic
<Kurra> this part is sorta sad in a way
<hidden_pony> I find it funny that the best moments of the mane 6 are when they are out-of-character
<Mush> Im gunna make a parody
<DocSane> Twilight has the advantage of being the main character.
<Ta_Dikin> I know that was a sad time
<Vordox> <--- Before Windigos?
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowDerpy: i see what they did right there...ADVERTISEMENT

<AlienWarhead> John_Williams: STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
<Fl00t4sh41> Tyler_The_Creator: You must be new around here
<DocSane> Dark_OOkami: I disagree. Fluttershy seems to be that in "Green Isn't Your Color", but AJ seems to be the one that Rarity can have actual heart to heart conversations with.
<CCharmanderK> Oh

<richfiles> I do hate the heat. I hate the cold too.. But it's easier (and more comfy) to bundle up than sweat your plot off! :$
<fluttercry> 05,15We worked hard on those.
<GabeMoist> The colors used in OCs hurt my eyes
<Barbetos> Jeez. again?
<PrincessLollipopGear> coinflip2, Low budget movie

<John_Williams> J_E_Smith71: Hey bro
<RainbowDerpy> are we having a lottery
<pony_6380> How long will this intermission last?
<AJIsAwesome> You also have to incorporate the other side of the fandom in your "worst fandom" judgement, Bronysith. Sometimes that side just take things too far.
<Juice> Pizza: Eat me
<Crown95> I fell out of line with the plot at that time, I think I was in to Ben 10.
<TheSplixer72> Yes what are we Spamming?

<CCharmanderK> SPIKE HAS A CRUSH ON RARITY
<Kandarihu> Before we get into the B Movie, I'd just like to ask you guys for advice. I'm having trouble choosing which Left 4 Dead game to go for. I played L4D2 during the free weekend and enjoyed it, but I'm hearing from a forum thread that L4D1 is the one to support.

<OohShiny> wut's Blitzwing?
<PinkieDash8797> so awesome I)^3^(I
<Lukeisun7> :P

<cowvarkian> Bronysith: you mean incorectly?
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: that would be pesimism, right?
<CityFlyer502> Well the intermission music is pretty calming.
<Shizuka> 13personally i still say 1 is best
<J_E_Smith71> Course I can always see the A tomorrow
<coinflip2> PrincessLollipopGear: OK thanks anyway
<fluttercry> 05,15L4D1 is so much fun.

<PinkieDash8797> don't worry we can rebuild him
<BaconMane> 0,5creepy isnt it
<Conyst> DerpAHerpster: get Adblock plus
<John_Williams> Shizuka: Actually, L4D2 doesn't
<pony_4064> ok they should really play some pony music instead of this jaz lol
<Skandranon> return of Spikezilla
<Juice> Pizza: I'm still alive
<Crown95> But then when his childhood ended, I was done with that stuff.
<CityFlyer502> Do we have the technology?
<MusicalSlyp> l4d2 is better i think
<Fl00t4sh41> Who wants an episode about chickens?
<Eli> Bronysith: bullshit. some of us still look for the good in things
<DerpyDitzyDoo> YAY

<Biltzwing> i think i watch POINES
<GlyphicStrike> I never got into Naruto.
<Shizuka> 13oh wait 2 is missing crash course isn't it
<cowvarkian> Eli: yeah, and since bronysith is a pessimistic hipster, it makes sense
<Minecraft_1997> No Lottery???
<pony_2591> i always seem to choose vid games and movies set in cold climates and i hate segments in games that have you trek through a desert or rainforest. funny that
<PrincessLollipopGear> This music should be elevator music!
<Fluffysaurus_Rex> Hey it's that BaconMane :3
<pony_6380> But I love jazz.
<MusicalSlyp> i like the special infected
<pony_4064> a;lkasd

<John_Williams> Shizuka: Nope, it isn't actually
<Conyst> lotto is tomorrow
<Bronysith> would you believe, that Major (AKA Irish_pony) would pay 50$ for this? http://badponyart.tumblr.com/image/32282101413
<valoreins|Drawing> feels like i wanna visit the temperate climate countries right now... i wanna experience snowy winter just once in my life :(
<Juice> LOL
<richfiles> I do! I want an episode about Chickens, and Nightmares!
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu: I liked L4D2 better, they probably want you to support L4D1 because Value made L4D2 a year after L4D1
<AJIsAwesome> All fandoms have their positives and negatives. You need to take the good with bad, and that goes for fandoms as well.
<TheSplixer72> Guess its time to go fap now :'(
<pony_4064> why dont they play pony music lo
<Fl00t4sh41> richfiles: I thought you had all of them by now

<Bronysith> cowvarkian: how am i a hipster?
<Xaiphafonese> its a thinkin sink
<Biltzwing> how does the lotty work?

<OohShiny> TheSplixer72: TMI dude

<coinflip2> TheSplixer72: have fun ;)
<TerraH> do we really have the technology to do that?
<weylin|Blarg> Yep. I have it
<Skandranon> Luke, Eeyup
<noponyknows> i saw that somewhere else recently
<pony7296> i saw a sleepless in ponyville clip
<Crown95> Has any one ever heard about Wicked City?
<Eli> cowvarkian: as much as it pains me, it seems to bring it to the point.
<pony_6380> I recall playing Crash COurse, I only have 2
<PinkieDash8797> *takes a slice*
<John_Williams> Shizuka: It's the lighthouse :$
<DerpyDitzyDoo> NOMNOMFCKINGNOM XD
<Fl00t4sh41> Another nightmare moon episode would be epic, true
<pony7296> scarier than sombra
<GlyphicStrike> Not me
<BlackRose> anyone remember full house
<Bronysith> i love final fantasy 7, chrono trigger, coca cola
<Crown95> It's the oldest anime I know of.
<Skandranon> lol
<Shizuka> 13not much of a content advantage over 2
<Xaiphafonese> bought? then yes JOIN ME
<OohShiny> TheSplixer72: Also, I hope it's just fapping
<pony7296> lol
<Fl00t4sh41> But the chickens, not so much
<Juice> *Bon-Bon gets hit by a pizza truck*
<weylin|Blarg> The lighthouse for survival is gone, though
<Bronysith> and yes
<Shizuka> 13for me it's the tighter design
<richfiles> Sadly, my area has not had all the waves, and I have been very broke as of late. I can only afford a few ponies hereand there.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: that makes my point
<BaconMane> 0,5pony_4064: ok you should really play some shut the hell up instead of your jaz lol
<Cosmo> brony65321: it's from the episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen"
<Biltzwing> so for the lotto what time does it start?
<Bronysith> he paid 50$ for that drawing
<Shizuka> 132 does way too much postprocessing
<AlienWarhead> brony655321: Spike said it during the episode titled "Feeling Pinkie Keen"
<Xaiphafonese> though it was stolen
<CityFlyer502> Let's up the ante.
<pony_6874> hey guys, who's perfroming this jazz? i like it
<Kandarihu> Does L4D1 have the A.I. Director in it? I kind of like that.
<CityFlyer502> I like trains.
<Lukeisun7> The season 3 opener lacked quite a bit in my eyes
<Bronysith> 50
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: do you like the glass bottles better?
<Crown95> Of course, what ever happen to the milk man.
<CoalDust> yay *hugs*
<Bronysith> dollars
<fluttercry> 05,15This jazz is so smooth
<Shizuka> 13ja 1 has the director

<TerraH> yeah guys! stop talking. the show's about to start!
<Bronysith> 50 dollars, for that shit drawing
<TheSplixer72> OohShiny: It can be whatever you want it to be ;)
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu: Yes
<J_E_Smith71> The jazz is awesome
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: yes
<Crown95> It's nice stuff.
<Shizuka> 13and with only three special infected to throw around i find it's more interesting

<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of RAT RACE: This movie has everything, From start to finish, it's all laughs. The movie is meant to be wacky and to be really taken seriously. I especially love the part when Jon Lovitz looks like Hitler. It's one of the best popcorn comedies of 2001. Just sit back and have fun. 10/10
