<Kirara> 04anyway Quilava
<Kirara> 04i made a mill deck XD

<Steve> 12 Hello, LaptopAristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Kjakings> 7I don't like this new Steve. he's too polite
<Kjakings> 7the old Steve had attitude

<Steve> 12 Hello, InfamousZed and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<InfamousZed> why is this a shaymin server now?
<InfamousZed> what happened to the dragonite
<Quilava> lol
<Quilava> also brb
<Prince-dari> There are about 5 servers, if you connect to irc.epic-chat.net, it still connect you to one of them.
<Prince-dari> You can individually connect to one though.
<Prince-dari> So you can connect straight to dragonite.irc.epic-chat.net
<Prince-dari> Or meowth, charizard, etc.
<InfamousZed> i mean this use to be dragonite wasnt it?
<Stormy> there are 3 servers
<Prince-dari> Dragonite was just one of the servers, so I don't really get what you mean by 'this'.
<Stormy> Shaymin, Charizard, and Dragonite
<Prince-dari> Meowth died? :o
<Stormy> Yeah
<Steve> 12 Hello, LaptopAristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Prince-dari> Wasn't there persian too?
<InfamousZed> i ment when i joined here i always saw dragonite but now i see shaymin
<Stormy> Some things started to go wrong with dragonite so shaymin and charizard are being used as the main servers now
<InfamousZed> ah
<Stormy> I believe that was the reason everyone was randomly disconnecting so often
<Stormy> whatever the problem was with dragonite
<InfamousZed> i still sometimes disconnect at random in here but not near as often
<Stormy> So do I, but I think that's my internet
<InfamousZed> the ping timeout thing
<Quilava> back
<Kirara> 04wb Quilava
<Kirara> 04how goes
<Quilava> bored out of my mind
<Kirara> 04play a game of magic?
<Kjakings> 7Prince-dari: do you play Mass Effect?
<Kirara> 04i have a couple decks to test out
<Kirara> 04before my friends decide to play TF2
<Kjakings> 7also, you should give Steve more attitude. now he's like a butler, which is not how Steve should be
<Prince-dari> Never played it, no.
<Kjakings> 7ah
<Aicebo> I like polite Steve, it brings out the true gay in him.
<Kjakings> 7I just melted my brain with convuluted plot-theorising for the third game
<Prince-dari> Haha.
<Prince-dari> Is it good, and what mediums is it on?
<Kjakings> 7BioWare know how to bring out the masochist in people. I have actually given myself a migraine trying to figure all this [censored] out but I can't stop.
<InfamousZed> wait for lambda to come in cause he seems to be the guru of it around here
<Kjakings> 7it's purely a pc game
<Kjakings> 7and some things only strike you the second or third playthrough
<Kjakings> 7it's brilliant
<Kjakings> 7the single greatest game I've ever played
<Kjakings> 7and it doesn't even have zombies
<Prince-dari> Hmm.
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Prince-dari> Haha, I'll look into getting it. XD
<Stormy> I've played both games once through
<InfamousZed> once i get a new laptop ill get both
<Stormy> on 360 though
<Kjakings> 7although, the first game has some serious graphical [censored]-ups at times. Like with the civilian women's clothing
<Kjakings> 7oh
<InfamousZed> stormy may help you
<Kjakings> 7I assumed it was exclusively for PC: Bioware are very pro-PC
<Stormy> Nope
<InfamousZed> shes a guru by association
<Kjakings> 7ah well
<Quilava> ok.
<Prince-dari> They probably made some deal with microsoft - the devil.
<Quilava> and are you joining them then?
<Kirara> 04if they decide to play i will
<Kjakings> 7I'm not typing it all out again. I think I'd exceed the monthly character limit or something. if Stormy truly wants to hear the ramblings of a madman I'll link her to the post I just made in a discussion thread
<Kirara> 04after all i never played TF2 with friends but i don't know when that will be i can always put them on hold until our game is over
<InfamousZed> lambda get off around 9 or so?
<Quilava> who all is playing?
<Stormy> yeah
<Kirara> 04lightning, hawkie, and maybe arrow
<Stormy> I don't know if he'll be here though
<Kirara> 04are we going to play or are we going to waste time?
<InfamousZed> he usually is though
<Quilava> I'm already on :|
<Kirara> 04oh
<InfamousZed> just wouldnt expect him here on his double day
<Kjakings> 7what times is it now where you are?
<Quilava> and I would play with, but I don't have it..
<InfamousZed> its 8 here
<Stormy> 7:01 PM
<Kjakings> 7... [censored] that. I'm not staying up until 3 am just to rip the mind out of Gordon
<Kjakings> 7he's needed to fight the combine
<InfamousZed> he needs to fight the sweater factory... or the sith or something i dont know what job hes at right now
<Kjakings> 7stop trying to get into inside jokes you clearly don't understand
<InfamousZed> hmm
<InfamousZed> you probably dont know where he works at then

<Neon> ORCS!
<Aicebo> sup
<Neon> Not much.
<Neon> Guess what today is?
<Aicebo> tuesday
<Aicebo> :P
<Neon> Nope...
<Neon> Three year OFF anniversary.
<Aicebo> OH YAY <3
<Aicebo> *shot*
<Neon> :P
<Aicebo> /nostalgia of the OFF days when the internet was nothing but our little group
<Neon> Haha, yeah...
<Neon> The blank pages on the map are being filled.
<Aicebo> ....now I'm lost
<Aicebo> :P
<Neon> Hehe.
<Neon> Lol, did you block me from YouTube?
<Aicebo> I don't think so....
<Neon> *on
<Neon> Was it back when this was your secret profile?
<Aicebo> I might have a couple years ago if I was [censored]ed at you or something, what's your username
<Neon> HappySnax1.
<Neon> The stupidest name ever.
<Aicebo> XD
<Aicebo> nah, Aicebo is the stupidest name ever
<Neon> I think it sounds cool.
<Aicebo> well, it's stupid when you have to explain it
<Aicebo> :P
<Aicebo> "Unblock user" yep I must have been [censored]ed at you LOL *unblocks*
<Neon> xD
<Neon> Thank ye.
<Neon> I subbed you, haha.
<Aicebo> yayz, subs
<Aicebo> I havent said yayz in ages
<Aicebo> today has kind of felt like a nostalgia day too actually, even though technically your 3 year anniversary day is tomorrow for me :P
<Neon> Oh, right. :O
<Aicebo> I wonder if the OFF will still be around when I'm like 20 years old
<Neon> It's only quarter to 10 for you.
<Neon> Aicebo: Around, probablt, but maybe not active.
<Neon> The Owler's Forum is still booming, somehow.
<Aicebo> is it really?
<Aicebo> wow
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Posts every day, anyway.
<Aicebo> that one was always waaaaaay more dead
<Neon> Nikki came back the other day. That was funny.
<Aicebo> I remember that owlboy always bugged me for some reason
<Neon> He's a snob.
<Aicebo> LOL I know right, she always logs in once like every 3 months, I got an email saying I got a PM I was like .____.; and then when I got to my inbox I was like "Oh, great...."
<Neon> IM SO FRIGGIN KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT OWLS N SHAT
<Aicebo> HEEHEE I'M SO HARDCORE, I WATCH SCARY MOVIES
<Aicebo> AND THATS SPECIAL BECAUSE I LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC
<Neon> ^ xD
<Neon> Lambda.
<Aicebo> I'm not sure if he's active,
<Aicebo> NOT ONLY DO I LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC BUT I'M ALSO A GIRL!!!!!!! I'M SO BRAVE!!!!!!!!!!
<Aicebo> *shot*
<Neon> What does *shot* even mean? :P
<Aicebo> basically to show you know what you said might be dumb/arrogant/overjoking/etc
<Neon> Oh, okay.
<Aicebo> so you get shot
<Aicebo> :'D
<Neon> Since we're looking for dumb people who are entertaining, you should invite Nikki on here. xD
<Neon> Or at least to #jailbait.
<Aicebo> oh my god the horror
<Aicebo> she'd probably be all like "IS IT SAFE????"
<Aicebo> and "WHY????"
<Aicebo> "CALL ME!!!!!!!!!"
<Neon> IS IT SAFES IS IT SECREIT?
<Aicebo> she's been trying to get on MM for about 6 months
<Aicebo> since she only logs in on OFF every 2 months or so
<Neon> XD
<Aicebo> asking me what her password is
<Neon> Why can't she get on?
<Aicebo> I'm like...
<Aicebo> how the [censored] should I know
<Aicebo> because she forgets stuff
<Aicebo> she's nikki
<Neon> :P
<Aicebo> :P
<Neon> You should do that, though.
<Neon> It'd be so hilarious.
<Neon> Pretend it's an owl chat.
<Aicebo> too much work
*Shy wonders why Corevette789 isnt in the urbandict channels :(
<Neon> But for so much gain.
<Aicebo> she dont even know anything about gog anyways, she got to page 7 of book 1 then gave up

<Raccoon> according to CBS, the documents on WikiLeaks reveal that, since 2003 when America invaded Afghanistan, America has been responsible for "more confirmed civilian casualties" than casualities resulting from terrorist bombings by the Taliban and Islamic Extremists in the same period, AND, still more deaths than the killings of the Saddam regime.
<Raccoon> So, it some how seems that we've defeated the terrorists after all. Just, not in the way we had expected.

<BPzeBanshee> Yes, The Necrowizard. :)
<BPzeBanshee> Hi Espeon
<Presea> heh
<Presea> necrowizard needs some improvment
<Presea> it's not dark enough
<Presea> for my liking
<BPzeBanshee> LOL
<BPzeBanshee> You're not true kvlt, that's blasphemy!
<BPzeBanshee> Blargh!
<Drake> 04ohai Espeon

<BPzeBanshee> Hi Drake
<Drake> 04hi BP
<BPzeBanshee> All Hail The Necrowizard. :D
*Drake is Lyon on TST
<BPzeBanshee> Ohai
<Presea> i prefer the anti pope
<BPzeBanshee> 10Lol
<Presea> :x
<Espeon> hi
<BPzeBanshee> 10Well, if you're going to commit blasphemy against the true kvlt, I should totally post this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNcjcBg1ORc
<BPzeBanshee> 10Have the happy trippy stuff instead
<BPzeBanshee> 10=D
<Presea> http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100810/ap_on_sc/eu_ice_island
<Presea> :x
<Presea> anyone up for a 100 sqaure mile chunk of ice?
<Presea> oh no worrys the whole 2012 thing is fake
<Presea> it's just global warming will kill us
<Presea> 8D
<BPzeBanshee> 10Finally, someone that uses their common sense. :D
<Espeon> right there we got enough ice to keep our drinks cold for centuries
<Espeon> booya
*Espeon dies
<BPzeBanshee> 10XD
<Presea> yes
<BPzeBanshee> 10All my precious Paul's Iced Coffees.....
<BPzeBanshee> 10I should buy the glacier and put turboboosters on it to control where it goes.
<Presea> in the late 1800s in the midwest of the US, around my area, alot of towns made Underground sections of the towns
<Presea> seems, this would be a good practice to do now
<Presea> to avoid heat
<Presea> :x
<BPzeBanshee> 10Indeed
<BPzeBanshee> 10I should do that where I live in Australia where the heat is already ridiculous anyway.
<BPzeBanshee> 10:P
<Presea> infact in those underground sections you had "roads" and sidewalks, and lines of stores
<BPzeBanshee> 10But then we need scientists to come up with some way to stop us from going pale in future generations.
<BPzeBanshee> 10Cause that's what happens genetically after a while when you dont need to withstand the sun.
<Presea> those tanning machines
<Presea> :x
<BPzeBanshee> 10They give you cancer, and at a rate some ten times faster than the sun itself.
<Presea> lol
<Presea> so do cellphones
<Presea> but we still use those
<Presea> well
<Presea> i don't
<BPzeBanshee> 10Actually I believe that got disproved.
<Presea> it's not
<Presea> general usage
<Presea> they proved that to be false
<Presea> but overuse
<Presea> that caused it
<Presea> any longterm exposer to radiowaves can start issues
<BPzeBanshee> 10Lol
<Presea> for instance ppl that live near radio stations
<BPzeBanshee> 10Well yeah, THAT much is true
<Presea> the 10-100KW FM stations
<Presea> that's abit...
<Presea> think about living near those for like decades
<Presea> something Will happen
<BPzeBanshee> 10Yeah
<BPzeBanshee> 10That much got proved, its basically another form of radiation sickness
<Presea> ya
<Espeon> people make a big deal out of everything
<Presea> at least we don't have to worry about tube tv's for much longer
<BPzeBanshee> 10Tube TVs?
<Presea> from the back, the protection against the xray gun is weaker
<Presea> so sitting behind or off to the side of one for an excess amount of time
<Presea> can be bad
<Presea> for instance let's say
<Presea> you have a big ass 32inch tube tv
<Presea> in the living room up against the wall
<Presea> and on the other side of that wall is
<Presea> your bed
<Presea> :x
<Presea> this situation happens alot
<Presea> what is giving everyone cancer is
<Presea> greed
<Presea> and ignorance
<BPzeBanshee> 10Tube TVs?
<Presea> yes
<BPzeBanshee> 10I've never heard of such thing.
<Presea> i'm sure
<BPzeBanshee> 10Are they TVs in Tubes?
<BPzeBanshee> 10:S
<Presea> no silly
<BPzeBanshee> 10OH
<BPzeBanshee> 10Like pre-Plasma/LCD/WTFBBQ TVs that are box things?
<Presea> Cathode ray tube
<Presea> those
<Espeon> it's really a series of tubes
<Espeon> I had to
<Espeon> sorry
*Espeon dies
<Presea> Lol
<BPzeBanshee> 10On the outside they're boxes.
<Presea> yes
<Presea> box tv's
<Espeon> !exakr
*eXAKR now belongs to Espeon for 10 minutes
<BPzeBanshee> 10Godammit
<BPzeBanshee> 10I missed out D:
<BPzeBanshee> 10You know I've never used !exakr before
*eXAKR still belongs to Espeon for 10 more minutes
<Presea> now we just have to worry about electromagnetic radiation
<Presea> from our electrics
<Presea> such as PCs
<Presea> and HD TVs
<Presea> fun
<Presea> more often gamming cases aren't properly sheilded
<Presea> and gammers suffer from More exposer
<Presea> then ppl generally would
<BPzeBanshee> 10You know what?
<BPzeBanshee> 10If we do anything these days we'll get cancer
<Presea> no
<Presea> if you drink the water you get female hormones
<Presea> not cancer
<BPzeBanshee> 10.......................that's it?
<Presea> pretty much
<BPzeBanshee> 10Ok
<BPzeBanshee> 10So, female hormones in a dude.
<BPzeBanshee> 10What does that do?
<Presea> well
<Presea> in a 13015 year old
<Presea> 13-15
<Presea> they are at risk of heh
<Presea> getting moobs
<BPzeBanshee> 10HEH?
<BPzeBanshee> 10Moobs?
<Presea> man boobs
<BPzeBanshee> 10:O
<Presea> also
<Presea> it could explain why guys are
<Presea> more often into guys
<Presea> then before
<Presea> if you drink amp
<Presea> you get More
<Presea> then you would from the water
<Presea> interestingly enough
<BPzeBanshee> 10Amp?
<Presea> amp enery drink
<BPzeBanshee> 10Ok
<Presea> male gammers are at high risk of many issues
<BPzeBanshee> 10We dont have those in Australia
<Presea> your lucky
<Growlithe> [Armageddon] dem cocky boys
<EpicStatsGuy> inb4 fail
<Presea> as for girls
<Espeon> lol
<Presea> the effects can only be positive

<Armageddon> 02(1) If reason exists then God exists.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Reason exists.
<Armageddon> 02(3) Therefore, God exists.
<Armageddon> I <censored> lol'd
<Espeon> long list is long
<Armageddon> 02(1) God is either necessary or unnecessary.
<Armageddon> 02(2) God is not unnecessary, therefore God must be necessary.
<Armageddon> 02(3) Therefore, God exists.

<Armageddon> 02Apparently
<Armageddon> 02this is a moral argument
<Armageddon> 02(1) Person X, a well-known atheist, was morally inferior to the rest of us.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Therefore, God exists.
*Presea pokes PM
<Armageddon> 02And this one is an argument from intelligence:
<Armageddon> 02(1) Look, there's really no point in me trying to explain the whole thing to you stupid atheists; it's too complicated for you to understand. God exists whether you like it or not.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Therefore, God exists.
<Armageddon> 02And I love how intelligence is underlined in green in Word
<Armageddon> 02the scribbly line thing

<Armageddon> 02(1) God is love.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Love is blind.
<Armageddon> 02(3) Stevie Wonder is blind.
<Armageddon> 02(4) Therefore, Stevie Wonder is God.
<Armageddon> 02(5) Therefore, God exists.
<Armageddon> the <censored>
<Espeon> it all makes sense now
<Armageddon> 02(1) My toaster is God.

<Armageddon> 02and this one is also sad
<Armageddon> 02(1) See that person spazzing on the church floor babbling incoherently?
<Armageddon> 02(2) That's how God's infinite wisdom reveals itself.
<Armageddon> 02(3) Therefore, God exists.
<Armageddon> 02I love 82 8D
<Armageddon> 0282.	ARGUMENT FROM "THE MATRIX"
<Armageddon> 02(1) We cannot prove that we don't live in a Matrix-like world.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Therefore we cannot know reality.
<Armageddon> 02(3) If reality is contingent, then everything is possible.
<Armageddon> 02(4) Therefore, God exists.
<BPzeBanshee> 10LOL
<Armageddon> 02(1) Jesus said some really cool stuff.
<Armageddon> 02(2) No one else had said that stuff.
<Armageddon> 02(2) Therefore, God exists.
<Armageddon> 02check out number 133
<Armageddon> 02(3) That probability came from my ass, which I know assigns extremely accurate probabilities to propositions concerning the existence of God

<Andres> The most interesting way that I woke up was back in either '06 or '07 when I woke up without my underwear when I clearly went to bed in them D:
<Andres> Apparently, I slept so restlessly that the underwear made its way down my legs and onto the floor o.o
<Andres> Which is not surprising, since I quite often wake up under the bedsheets these days.

<Light_Latias> D:
*drfsupercenter is back
<Andyman> Welcome back DRF!
<Quanyails> 7WB.
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend came over
<Light_Latias> wb drf
<drfsupercenter> 03and we started talking about NIntendo hacking for half an hour LOL
<Light_Latias> <late>
<drfsupercenter> 03It's now technically legal to hack your consoles
<Andyman> wow
<Light_Latias> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03but, at the same time, it's also legal for Nintendo to void your warranty for doing so
<drfsupercenter> 03I like my friend's analogy
<Light_Latias> it is?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like making it legal to rob a bank, but then making it legal for the cops to arrest you
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<Lugia365> wb drf
<drfsupercenter> 03as of about 2 weeks ago
<drfsupercenter> 03they made Jailbreaking and all of that legal
<SheenaFox> wb drf
<Light_Latias> weird o.o
<SheenaFox> *somewhatlate*
<Lugia365> lol
<Andyman> Very interesting
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not weird, it's actually really awesome XD
<Light_Latias> still weird
<Andyman> *wonders if hacking his PSP is possible*
<drfsupercenter> 03Which PSP do you have?
<Andyman> If I can hack it, I might actually use it!
<drfsupercenter> 03the original or slim?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Andyman> 3000
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03nope, it's not hackable.
<Andyman> Damn it...
<drfsupercenter> 03only 1000 and 2000 are hackable
<drfsupercenter> 033000 can be TIF-exploited but that only works until you turn it off LOL
<Andyman> I should have gotten a 2000...
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually paid for a 2000 on eBay and the dude sent me a 1000 LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I would have returned it but it was in like, brand new condition so I decided to just keep it
<Andyman> 1000s are like bricks, are they not?
<Infamouz> :S
<drfsupercenter> 03Actually not really
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend has a 2000, it's not that much slimmer
<drfsupercenter> 03it's about half the weight
<drfsupercenter> 03but as for being "slim', it's only like 1/4" smaller
<drfsupercenter> 03kinda misleading IMO

<Hawkie> ^v^
<Hawkie> Hii
<nintendofreak> dragon time then jump over them
*Kyu sits all over Hawkie
<JLF> i tried that yesterday
*Hawkie eats Kyu
<Roxas> how are you today ?
<JLF> it's just hard for me cause i don't time it right
<Hawkie> Bored XD
<Hawkie> You?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Steve and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<JLF> i did use dark spyro's move at one point
<Roxas> hmm.... same, i'm killing time on forums
<JLF> i wonder what's the point of those lasers anyway
<nintendofreak> death
<Hawkie> Ah
<Hawkie> x3
<Hawkie> Im lonely
<JLF> well that and like are they supposed to be like the conduits?
<Hawkie> after arrow left i guess
<nintendofreak> ... conduits are annoying at times
<Roxas> i'm sorry *friendly hugs*
<JLF> i earth shot them
<JLF> i hate the leeches
<Ripred> 2i wanna friendly hug D:
<JLF> and crystal golems
<JLF> oh nintendofreak thanks for that tip with ravage rider
<JLF> :D
<nintendofreak> yw
<JLF> and it doesn't waste all ur mana either
<Ripred> 2il take that as a no....
*Ripred 2crys
<JLF> did u say u can do that same move on the executioner?
<Kjakings> 7hah
<Roxas> i know a friendly hug doesn't help much Hawkie but it's the best i can offer
<Roxas> that and my support if you need it
*Hawkie squishes
<nintendofreak> yep
<JLF> oh ok
<JLF> shame it doesn't work on skabb
<Ripred> 2i still want one D:
<JLF> :(
<JLF> it doesn't does it?
<Roxas> everything is going to be ok, ok hawkie ?
<nintendofreak> works takes longer though...
<Hawkie> Alright.
<Hawkie> ^^
<nintendofreak> easy to get hit by him though
<JLF> ah
<JLF> i know someone who used fire breath on him
<Roxas> interesting.... alot of new info on black/white today including a feature called dream world
<nintendofreak> level 4 triple fire balls work just takes a long time to kill him that way
<Ripred> 2rly?
<Ripred> 2whats it like?
<Ripred> 2wat
<Ripred> 2wi
<JLF> well they used comet dash
<Ripred> 2wait*
<Roxas> http://serebii.net/blackwhite/dreamworld.shtml
<JLF> along with melee
<Ripred> 2is it that thing
<Ripred> 2where you put your pokemon in it?
<Ripred> 2andmeet other people's pokemon?
<Roxas> no this is a completely new just announced feature
<Ripred> 2oh
<Roxas> hey May
<May> hey
<Roxas> @Ripred and TMs now don't disappear after use
<JLF> first time i faced skabb i did that
<Ripred> 2awsome!
<Roxas> meaning you can spread useful TMs across your entire team if desired
<Roxas> another new feature is the Pokemon Musical mode
<Ripred> 2col!!!!
<Ripred> 2cool*
<SheenaFox> Huzzah, done making pancakes :D
<Roxas> this feature will allow you to enter your pokemon in the musical and earn items
<Michel> hi quil :)
<JLF> second time dark spyro!
<Ripred> 2oh yah
<Ripred> 2i saw that
<JLF> i wonder if skabb's hard on the gameboy advance
<Roxas> but by far the most interesting change imo is Miracle Shooter
<Ripred> 2o_O
<Roxas> your earn pts every turn in a wireless battle and then when you have enough you can spend it on items IN BATTLE
<Roxas> you*
<Ripred> 2O_O
<Roxas> definitely adding yet another layer of strategy to the games
<Ripred> 2indee
<Ripred> 2indeed
<Ripred> 2they need to make it
<Ripred> 2so you evolve in battle
<Ripred> 2THAT would be cool
<JLF> anyone know?
<Icydragon> Not for me...
<Icydragon> >.>
<Roxas> i think that might of been one of the ideas they're throwing around apparently
<JLF> oh was he easy?
<Ripred> 2yah
<Ripred> 2there is a thred here about it
<Roxas> i'm about 80% sure they're implement it
<Roxas> unless it becomes too difficult to code
<JLF> hey nintendofreak what TEN boss was hard for you?
<Roxas> or has a potential to cause glitches
<nintendofreak> all of them on 1st play through :p
<JLF> what about second time around?
<nintendofreak> scabb... didn't learn tricks yet
<nintendofreak> and gual
<JLF> second time around for me, skabb, arborick, and ravage rider
<JLF> gaul was a pain till i understood his pattern
<Roxas> Hawkie i forget you were for or against Gen 5 ?
<Hawkie> Uh
<Hawkie> Against it, because I dont see the point anymore..
<Roxas> I think they're really trying alot of new concept this time around tho and that you should still give it a chance
<nintendofreak> >.> boss battles in brawl on intense completely destroys gaul
<Roxas> alot of these new features look to refresh games as well as the metagame
<Roxas> the metagame hasn't been changed like this in a long time
<Ripred> 2the look really good
<Ripred> 2im REALLY exited for the animated battles
<Ripred> 2arti :D
<Articuno> 12Hi!
<Quilava> hi
<nintendofreak> especially tabuu's 1 hit ko move....
<Roxas> hey sup Articuno :)
<Articuno> 12Hey Roxas! ^^
<Roxas> did you hear about all the significant changes to the metagame that are being implemented with black/white ?
<Articuno> 12Nothing much, just waiting around for Lugia again XD
<Articuno> 12Dont think so
<Roxas> you haven't heard about dream world yet ? or the pokemon musicals, TMs not disappearing after use
<Roxas> damn too many to list out, alot of changes to the base game are being made
<Ripred> 2i dont know ifi like the musicals :x
<Ripred> 2they look wierd
<Articuno> 12Where can I read all of this?
<Roxas> still the potential to earn items is nice
<Glacymr> 12hi Articuno
<Articuno> 12Hi!
<Roxas> http://serebii.net/index2.shtml
<Glacymr> 12:)
<Articuno> 12Thanks!
<JLF> omg
<Glacymr> 12how goes
<JLF> i hate that
<Ripred> 2whats the "metagame"?
<Glacymr> 12what's currently being played the most
<Glacymr> 12what you might have the most chances of fighting off against
<Roxas> did Ripred really just ask what a metagame is ?
<Ripred> 2T_T
<Roxas> the metagame is very base of the game, the very core
<Glacymr> 12either that or it's something you make that is designed to beat another thing someone has
<Glacymr> 12i've seen it used in both terms
<Roxas> it's almost like the framework of the game, things that carry over each and every game
<Glacymr> 12"the metagame right now is mostly Blastoise and Infernape decks"
<nintendofreak> could never beat boss battles on intense....
<Glacymr> 12"stop metagaming my abomasnow deck"
<Roxas> err Glacymr wrong metagame ?
<JLF> odd someone told me that using dark spyro during the 1st part of the Gaul fight, u don't get hit
<Roxas> i meant the metagame of the video games
<Glacymr> !define metagame
<[TST]Bot> -!- Metagaming is a broad term usually used to define any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. ...
<nintendofreak> ugh hey they were wrong
<nintendofreak> :p
<Ripred> 2Roxas: did Ripred really just ask what a metagame is ?
<JLF> u tried it?
<Ripred> 2:(
<nintendofreak> yep
<JLF> what happens?
<Roxas> thanks Glacymr that's pretty much what metagame is, thank goodness for bots
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<nintendofreak> you still get hit just now its twice as hard to killg aul
<Quanyails> 7Metagame is the game outside the game.
<Quanyails> 7Hence, meta.
<Ripred> 2wuan :D
<Articuno> 12Wow too much to take in here..
<Articuno> 12I'm starting to lose itnerest, and I'm just looking up the new Pokemon instead XD
<Roxas> Quanyails: did the metagame really need a refresh ?
<JLF> oh someone did tell me the pots rumor is truw
<JLF> *true
<JLF> the pots in Gaul's first stage
<Roxas> ALOT is changing in black/white articuno
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12metaknight :D
<Ripred> 2i just hope they dont chnge it TOO much ..
<Ripred> 2change*
<Roxas> @ Quanyails just asking your thoughts on it
<CrazyPresea> hi
<JLF> do u ever hit Gaul in the air when he puts u in his spin?
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7Refresh?
<Ripred> 2i would have bought the game canges or not =/
<nintendofreak> no i just land
<JLF> oh i do
<Ripred> 2i dont undestand why people arnt as exited for the animated battles as i am xD
<JLF> wonder what happens to u when he swings his arms back and forth?
<Roxas> Quanyails: is that the wrong term, i mean they're taking ALOT of liberties with the series this time
<Roxas> maybe a few too many
<nintendofreak> round 2 does 1/3 damage to your health... per hit
<JLF> dang
<Quanyails> 7It depends on the game; for example, Chess's metagame is the study of all the openings and strategies and the like.
<JLF> i only hate his laser eye
<Ripred> 2woh
<Ripred> 2wth
<Ripred> 2?
<Ripred> 2i keep getting adds in mibbit for a pokemonMMORPG

*Neon just missed a meteor shower.
<Neon> FAIL
<Prince-dari> I looked for that.
<Prince-dari> Couldn't find it.
<Neon> The metors are very private about who sees them shower.
<Neon> *meteors
<Prince-dari> Yeah, thought I could catch a sneaky peek though. :o
<Neon> Pervert.
<Prince-dari> (;
<Prince-dari> :P
<Neon> Two-faced.
<Prince-dari> Indeed.
<Neon> Trololololololololololololo.
<Prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Prince-dari> Have you heard trololo man, metal version?
<Neon> I've been letting that play for like twenty minutes now
<Neon> No, haha.
<Prince-dari> My God, how do you survive with that on. :O
<Neon> I eventually forgot about it

<eXAKR> Good grief this Duke Nukem Forever thing is insane
<Prince-dari> Hey Neon?
<Neon> Yes?
<Prince-dari> You remember I said I had water trapped in my ear, well it developed into an infection. XD
<Neon> Seriously? That's awful.
<Prince-dari> So I'm pretty much deaf in one ear, can be useful for when I don't want to listen to someone though.
<Neon> ^ XDDD
<Neon> I can totally see that advantage.
<Prince-dari> WHAT?!?!?
<Prince-dari> Ohh, nevermind...
<Neon> I randomly go deaf from time to time anyway, which is especially handy when I'm babysitting.
<Prince-dari> Is this selective deafness, or for real? :P
<Neon> Somewhere in between.
<Neon> I have awful hearing as it is, but I also tune out people automatically.
<Neon> It gets quite annoying, though, when I have to control how quiet or loud I am, or how softly I should whisper, etc.
<Neon> Because I don't hear things the way average people do.
<Prince-dari> My hearing's not so great either, under normal circumstances.
<Prince-dari> Apparently I talk really loudly.
<Neon> Ha, Censor Cat got you.
<Prince-dari> cirstances then.
<Neon> :P
<Neon> Wow... someone's status on Facebook is "Jerk off session at my place!"
<Prince-dari> ...Ooooooooooook.
<Prince-dari> I'd avoid that person if I were you. :P
<Neon> I try to. She's an annoying... female dog.
<Prince-dari> She? O_o
<Neon> Yes. O_O
<Neon> It was obviosly a joke, but poor taste. :P
<Prince-dari> Wow, slut much?
<Neon> *obviously
<Neon> Failbook can be fun, however. I love commenting on statuses that are song lyrics and responding seriously.
<Prince-dari> Hahaha, that's great.
<Neon> Like one was from a Brand New song, and it goes: "Do you ever wake up and realize your life is meaningless?" And I responded: "That happened to me once, then I realized I had just woken up in a dream in which I'm an existential nihilist.
<Neon> "
<Prince-dari> Sorry, had to go AFK for a min.
<Prince-dari> LOLOLOL
<Prince-dari> Did the person reply?
<Neon> Nope. Probably didn't know what it was. :/
<Neon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWCqZPOxFA
<Neon> Watch that. xD
<Prince-dari> Lol, I hadn't even thought it could be fox.
<Neon> Me either, haha.
<Neon> Well, what's up?
<Prince-dari> Not much, you?
<Neon> Eatin' cereal... spilling it... biting my lip by accident.
<Neon> It's the little things that hold the pleasure.
<Prince-dari> Lol.
<Neon> It's 2:20 AM, and as useful, I'm wide awake.
<LaptopAristeo> nini peeps
<Kitten> ni ni
<Neon> Ever wonder what it'd be like to cry urine?
<Prince-dari> Unpleasant, I'd assume.
<Neon> Mhm. Not to mention asll warm..
<Neon> *all
<Prince-dari> I suppose it could be pleasant if your face is freezing.
<Neon> Right... and if your face gets flushed it'll all go down.
<Prince-dari> Lawl, it's nasty, when I sleep on my ear, some puss drips out and turns crusty on it.
<Neon> Ugh, I've had that before.
<Neon> To cheer you up: http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs023.snc4/33491_418913234326_727564326_4954695_2275910_n.jpg

*Tuffy sighs
<Glacymr> 12here we go, here's some humor for you Tuffy
<Espeon> brb
<Tuffy> 04I already knew about Unown's strategy
<Light_Latias> kay
<Glacymr> 12This is an ingenious moveset spread across the ages, constructed piece by piece with painstaking care in the arching caverns and ancient machinery of the most devious and cunning hive mind in the history of anything.
<Glacymr> 12This moveset brings Unown's fullest potential into the light. His most powerful move, Hidden Power, rips through Magikarp, Hoppip, and Feebas with its unimaginable power, 2HKOing and OHKOing Magikarp and Hoppip with Hidden Power Ice, respectively. A neutral Hidden Power gives Feebas the ol' one-two-hit KO. When facing such opponents, Unown is unbeatable.
<Glacymr> 12:D
<Tuffy> 04You know what really grinds my gears?
<Glacymr> 12family guy
<Tuffy> 04Heh
<Glacymr> 12sort of got old for me 8D

<Spyrorocks> Kja can be a little bitch sometimes, you just need to put him in his place.
<Proto> But big explosions are the crap hollywood has peddled for years
*May|AFK punts Sheena to go sign up

<JLF> is Kja a boy or girl?
<Spyrorocks> Guy

<Curly> like Up is weird after you realize a kid disappeared with an old man in a flying house for a few weeks and then comes back as if nothing happened :p
<JLF> oh
<SheenaFox> Yeah, I just have no idea what to put right now
<SheenaFox> XD

<Proto> heh
<Spyrorocks> You need to make it clear that you don't give a shit about what he has to say.
<Neon> ^ Truth
<HyperMetalSonic> The lugiabot is crazy!
<Andrew> [19:06:49] <HyperMetalSonic> No bsod with Win 7 so far
<Proto> I've only seen a few current movies
<Spyrorocks> And theres always an ignore button
<Cyndi> 10^true ture
<JLF> :) thanks Spyrorocks
<Cyndi> 10true*
<Cyndi> 10i know
<Spyrorocks> click on his name and select "ignore"/
<Proto> Up, no country for old men and 2012
<Andrew> that's because they actually removed the BSOD completely from the OS
<Andrew> so it can't actually happen
<Curly> O:
<Cyndi> 10but then he'll say stuff behind my back
<Curly> no country for old men was great :D
<HyperMetalSonic> OF course, it's PERFECT
<Spyrorocks> So what?
<Cyndi> 10oh wait
<Stitch> 2012 had me off the edge of my seat. XD
<JLF> there's a PM button too
<Cyndi> 10that doesnt work
<JLF> cause i tried to PM nintendofreak
<Proto> I agree Curly
<Spyrorocks> Hes some kid 5000 miles away from you.
<Stitch> Literally.
<JLF> it failed
<HyperMetalSonic> Actually, it happened once
<Andrew> so if your pc does crash, no blue screen
<Proto> 2012 had me laughing really hard
<Cyndi> 10i tried it a couple of times and it wont work
<Stitch> I leaned forward and slipped off the couch.
<drf|work> Andrew, ORLY

<drf|work> -u
<drf|work> looked just like XP but with a more modern font LOL
<Cyndi> 10hey JLF can you see this post?
<JLF> yea
<HyperMetalSonic> Due to a bad Soundblaster card
<drf|work> it was caused by faulty hardware, but still.
<Cyndi> 10damn

<Spyrorocks> Kja says a lot of things about a lot of people, you need not worry about what he says because no one pays any attention to him.
<drf|work> http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/695e37ed-b205-4085-9e0c-3d7975fc8c75.jpg <- This reminds me of the average Mac user

<nintendofreak> nope
<JLF> ah

<JLF> celestial caves
<JLF> <.<
<nintendofreak> so boring
<JLF> i know especially the rooms
<JLF> it's so tedius
<Neon> The whole game should be
<Neon> Celestial caves.
<JLF> why?
<Neon> I just wanted to contradict, I don't know.
<JLF> oh
<JLF> lol
<JLF> i prefer the mountain
<JLF> level
<Neon> I let my friend borrow TLOS: ANB for llike five months... turns out he sold it with all of his other GameCube games. D:
<drf|work> Holy
<JLF> wow
<HyperMetalSonic> What
<drf|work> I just saw someone use the "o3o" face outside of TST
<drf|work> Wow, that disease must be deadlier than I thought
*drf|work hides
<nintendofreak> ouch
*HyperMetalSonic gets into the closet
<Neon> Same with SSBM.
<nintendofreak> ugh major ouch.......
<Neon> He honestly didn't mean to, but it was annoying.
<JLF> new beginning wasn't too bad minus the scorpions
*HyperMetalSonic gets into the basement, under the closet
<JLF> and the cynder's lair
<Neon> He just piled all of his hames up and brought them for trade-in.
<Neon> *games
<nintendofreak> scorpions were lame i just ice speared em
<nintendofreak> >.> better not of been at gamestop
*May|AFK locks HyperMetalSonic in a bomb shelter
<nintendofreak> like the worst place to sell them at
*HyperMetalSonic forgets supplies!
<JLF> i hated Cynder's lair
<JLF> it was too long
<Neon> Yes, that was before I enlightened him that trade-ins there are a scam.
<May|AFK> I think you'll be find
<JLF> i hate gamestop
<JLF> i shop at play n trade
<nintendofreak> only time i EVER buy from them is if a they have a good deal on a *NEW* game
<nintendofreak> otherwise i usually stick to amazon
<Neon> GameStop has a good deal going on right now.
<Neon> A lot of games are like 20 dollars off.
<Neon> I don't know what I'm going to do, though. I have one dollar and Reach comes out in a month.
<Neon> :P
<nintendofreak> lol
<Neon> If I only had one more dollar, maybe they could procreate and have a litter of quarters.
<nintendofreak> i'm kinda tempted to get metroid other m mainly due to the $20 bonus but i know i wouldnt like it
<Neon> Mhm.
<JLF> hey spyro-legend
<Khad> wb
<Espeon> thx
*ChinChilla 14sniffs Ripred.
<JLF> the only part of the celestial caves i liked was the elemental dragon and meeting the chronicler

*Jess yawns
*HyperMetalSonic used a Bullhorn- Your Mom's calling for ya!
<Neon> same here.
<Neon> I'd run out of lives and have to start back the ENTIRE world.
<Neon> When I was a noob at it, thta is.

<drf|work> WTF]'
<drf|work> What just happened?
<HyperMetalSonic> Strange
<Espeon> ping
<drf|work> ocean.lugia.us said could not connect, ocean.systemnet.info kicked me off
<drf|work> something about no CGI:IRC access
<ChinChilla> 14owo
<drf|work> I'm using Nest ATM :/
<ChinChilla> 14Something happened?
<drf|work> Yeah
<drf|work> it said terminated
<drf|work> and I can't get back on
<drf|work> I had to switch servers
<ChinChilla> 14Huh. I'm on ocean.
<Articuno> 12Stop acting like it's a bad thing DRF D:<
<HyperMetalSonic> Random Quote: We need your oven, Star Fox!
<Articuno> 12Ocean has gone down more times this week than Nest has in an entire month XD
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I just like ocean better
<drf|work> it has SSL
<drf|work> Not that I use SSL on Mibbit, but still.
<Articuno> 12Fine I'll put SSL on nest then
<HyperMetalSonic> I never lose my connections
<ChinChilla> 14Ocean's had a habit of being the better server.
<drf|work> Or I can just use ocean :>
<drf|work> yeah,t hat.
<Feather> Ok back...
<drf|work> dunno what's wrong with the datacenter, nothing's perfect
<JLF> man everyone left
<Articuno> 12Only because it doesn't get VNCed onto and isn't on wireless XD
<drf|work> LOL wireless
<drf|work> fail
<HyperMetalSonic> Wireless servers?
<Articuno> 12Hey didn't I say it would stop going down as soon as I got cable broadband though?
<drf|work> but I still don't care XD
<Articuno> 12Now it only goes down when I VNC on and forget to set the display options to 16bit (for some reason that disconnects the wireless)
<HyperMetalSonic> I wonder what type of computer it is?
<Articuno> 12Take a guess
<HyperMetalSonic> Linux?
<Articuno> 12No but I considered putting that on because of how slow it is
<HyperMetalSonic> Windows?
<Articuno> 12Yeh
<HyperMetalSonic> What version?
<Andres> They go through bone like butter!
<Articuno> 12XP
<Articuno> 12Pro
<Articuno> 12You should guess what specs it has
<HyperMetalSonic> Thats old
*Andres throws ninja butterknives!
<HyperMetalSonic> Pentium 4?
<Articuno> 12Nope
<HyperMetalSonic> AMD?
<Articuno> 12no
<JLF> sucks huh nintendofreak?
<drf|work> EW AMD
<HyperMetalSonic> Intel Core 2 Duo
<Articuno> 12Nope
<Articuno> 12Can I just tell you?
<HyperMetalSonic> Tell us!
<Articuno> 12It's an intel celeron R 2.53ghz and 256 ram
<nintendofreak> better than when it used to be dead for days
<Articuno> 12But hey, it does the job!
<HyperMetalSonic> That is your personal?
<drf|work> Ocean does the job better
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12Personal what?
<HyperMetalSonic> Computer
<JLF> yeah
<Jess> hat happened to all the member status? did the updating reset everything?
<Jess> *what
<Articuno> 12It was someone's personal computer
<Articuno> 12and no, nothing's actually been updated, I just messed up
<HyperMetalSonic> Oh no
<Jess> ok
<Articuno> 12You see the meteor shower last night?
<Jess> o.O no
<HyperMetalSonic> Maybe
<Andres> http://thisisphotobomb.com/2010/08/11/photobomb-that-guy-roflcopter-gets-its-wings/
<HyperMetalSonic> Was it like lightning?
<Articuno> 12One of them was

<Articuno> 12It burned up into three pieces and glowed different colours
<Articuno> 12Last night
<Jess> what kinda time?
<Articuno> 12Uhh, 11.30ish
<Jess> was in bed then
<HyperMetalSonic> Nope, too many thunder storms, strangely starting at about 9:30 Pm
<Articuno> 12Well actually we were out at 10.45 when we saw the biggest
<HyperMetalSonic> Wait... I did see it!
<Jess> we keep getting up at like 6am every moring now, and have started to have early nights coz we get so tired
<Stitch> Angel flares! :D
<HyperMetalSonic> There were about 10 seconds per flash
<May|AFK> wait what? there's a meteor shower?
<HyperMetalSonic> Was
<May> oh
<May> that's too bad
<May> I haven't really gone to go see a meteor shower yet
<JLF> lol
<SheenaFox> Ah, I tried waking up for that
<SheenaFox> I couldn't
<HyperMetalSonic> I never really seen a meteor shower before...
<HyperMetalSonic> I've
<Articuno> 12I go after every meteor shower that occurs
<Articuno> 12Even if I have to travel somewhere with clear skies
<Articuno> 12It's quite important to me I guess you could say
<HyperMetalSonic> There are always too many cloulds and lights in my area!
<Feather> Wtf >_>
<Articuno> 12LOL I love that message
<HyperMetalSonic> What is Ocean again?
<drf|work> what messages

<drf|work> they have an option for public transit
<Stitch> http://thisisphotobomb.com/2010/08/12/photobomb-that-guy-screw-it-up-jenga/
<Articuno> 12I'm guessing you'll wanna stay on the A19 though
<drf|work> at least here they do, they should have it in the UK too
<Tuffy> 04Oh I have no idea...
<Articuno> 12Yes they do have that come to think of it
<drf|work> yeah
<drf|work> just put in your start and end points and click public transit
<drf|work> and it'll tell you which bus routes to take
<drf|work> :)
<drf|work> I've done that a bit at the university as we can't have cars on campus LOL
<Articuno> 12I just tried it, it's being stupid and only giving me national express routes
<Tuffy> 04Wheres Public Transit?
<drf|work> Um
<drf|work> Not sure actually, haven't used the site in a while
<Articuno> 12How come not train then?
*Jess nibbles on some catnip and passes out
<Tuffy> 04It costs a lot apparently.
<Articuno> 12Train's usually always cheaper than bus
<Articuno> 12Let me check.....
<drf|work> ask Xai to hook you up with a free ride?
*drf|work runs
<Articuno> 12That reminds me, I'm getting my free rail pass in two months!
<Hawkie> Why?
<Hawkie> XD
<Hawkie> Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Articuno> 12That means I won't need Xai to get us on free anymore, I can go on my own
<Articuno> 12why am I getting it you mean Hawkie?
<Hawkie> Yes
<Articuno> 12I will have been living with him for two years :>

<drf|work> Android 2.2 isa wesome
<drf|work> I just moved a 10MB app to my SD card
<drf|work> and it's now only using 200KB on my phone ^^
<drf|work> that's the one thing that's annoying, how little space I get for apps
<Articuno> 12I can upgrade too, right?
<drf|work> Um
<drf|work> you have to root your phone
<Stitch> No idea.
<Articuno> 12Lame
<Articuno> 12I'm too lazy
<drf|work> or wait for the company to release an upgrade
<HyperMetalSonic> Root?
<drf|work> like
<JLF> ugh i hate this level
<drf|work> same as jailbreaking an iPhone
<drf|work> but easier
<HyperMetalSonic> Oh.
<drf|work> well
<HyperMetalSonic> Don't have either
<drf|work> Verizon hasn't officially released 2.2
<drf|work> so therefore the only way to get it is via root
<Xeeshu> i thought it was you Stitch .. lol
<drf|work> if your cell provider releases it
<drf|work> then you're fine
<Xeeshu> the last one :D
<drf|work> probably not though :/
<drf|work> do you even have 2.0?

<Articuno> 12I think I have 1.5 but can't remembver
<drf|work> yeah, that's a huge jump then LOL
<drf|work> You'd have to upgrade to 1.6, then 2.0, then 2.1, THEN 2.2
<drf|work> :/
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> Mine came with 2.0, I upgraded to 2.1, then to 202

<Stitch> Mm, you'll have to ask someone else. I've never used ChatZilla.
<HypeMetalSonic> Random tetris renders your discussion invalid

<HypeMetalSonic> Really?
<May> LOL
<Feather> LOL
<May> but wouldn't you prefer to cut your hand off first, drf?
*ChinChilla 14sniiffs HypeMetalSonic

<Feather> Hi Ripred :D
<HyperMetalSonic> That is much better
<ChinChilla> 14'w'
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> apparently on Mibbit
<drf|work> setting your away time to 0
<drf|work> makes it infinite
<ChinChilla> 14Does it?
<ChinChilla> 14I'd figured it would do opposite, having you away all of the time.
<HyperMetalSonic> How do you put text near your name on Java?
<drf|work> nope
<drf|work> I just asked in their help channel
*ChinChilla 14like this?
<drf|work> 0 is infinite
<drf|work> which is actually used in programming a lot so that makes sense
<ChinChilla> 14Or like drf's name?
<drf|work> wait what
<drf|work> I just used |
<drf|work> Just because the car in front of you is going doesn’t mean the light is green. <- LOL
<HyperMetalSonic> Strange...
<JLF> stupid guys in the fire room
<drf|work> When taking pictures at your 6 year old sister’s first performance in a play,make sure you have the right blue-eyed blonde. A camera full of pictures of a random little girl’s performance will not go over well with your parents. <- LOL
<Andres> Time for some long, long rest :o

<Ripred> 2HSM
<nintendofreak> my opinion why there were soo many crappy games the developers assumed the wii would fail when they found out it started selling really well they rushed games onto it resulting in more crappy games then many gamers just left the system
*Shadowsfall hugs JLF
<Kyu> 07i'm impressed that there's something wrong with my computer that's actually MY fault for once
<Ripred> 2HMS

<drf|work> I've had a Blu-Ray drive
<Espeon> Oh

<drf|work> just because I can.
<Aristeo> It's thundering, not gonna get to go

<Sky|Art> Articuno, can I PM you?
<drf|work> EVGA makes good video cards
<drf|work> never tried their motherboards
*Quilava drips
<nintendofreak> i'm guessing developers learned their mistake from the wii cause the 3ds is getting flooded with good looking titles
<Aristeo> It'll probably be fine in about an hour though
<Kyu> 073 way sli capable o3o
<Ripred> 2how much is a good graphics card? @_@
<drf|work> $200 or so?

<drf|work> just type /join #channel
<Sky|Art> /join #channel
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> with no spaces
<Neon> ...Kjakings?
<drf|work> and change #channel to the channel you want to join

<Sky|Art> join*
<Kjakings> 7yeah what?
<Sky|Art> i also spamed that channel
<drf|work> no./
<Sky|Art> lol
<drf|work> why would we join it knowing that you're going to spam it?
<Neon> Well... ther'es been some funny stuff going on in SC concerning you.
<Neon> *there's
<Sky|Art> lol
<Kjakings> 7oh?
<Neon> Yep. Basically eveyr n00b on SC was whining about you to SR, and SR went on this big rant. xD
<Neon> *every
<Kjakings> 7oh?
<Neon> Oh.
<Kjakings> 7that was an 'expand' oh, not a conformation oh
<Neon> I know, haha.
<Neon> But basically Cyndi, nintendofreak, JLF, and probably Icy if he had been there were conspiring against you for "bullying and harassment."
<Neon> It was full of lulz because SR was being incredibly hypocrticial.
<Neon> *hypocritical
<Kjakings> 7what did SR say?
<Neon> Mostly harmless stuff, because he doesn't intend to ban you or anything.
<Neon> He just kept going on about how they shouldn't listen to you and how [censored]y you can be.
<Kjakings> 7if he hasn't banned me yet he won't ban me now
<Neon> But he went out of his way to act like a good admin, which I've never seen him do. And to nooblets no less.
<Kjakings> 7even if he does it'll only be for like a week. Hail taught me that
<Neon> xD This isn't a warning.
<JLF> yay waffles
<May> drf, how many tabs do you have open?
<drf|work> If your older cousin just finished doing time for statutory rape and is living with you and your parents and if perchance your friend comes over and said cousin asks him how old he is (to which he replies "18"), please refrain from saying, "That’s what she said!"

<drf|work> call me weird, but it works

<Creideiki> 00,01<late><random>First of all Ripred, in that ALLCAPS sentence you wrote I can see several glaring errors. Namely, "can't" is spelt with an apostrophe. "Stant" should be "stand." "Scilence" should be silence. The sentence should not be in ALLCAPS. And you forgot to end it with a proper punctuation mark.00,01</random></late>

<Lambda> hello Proto
<Proto> hi
<Proto> I feel like crap...but I think I'm getting paid good
<Proto> And hot water on a bad sunburn feels like you're on fire
<Aristeo> :)
<Aristeo> Hi Proto :)
<Proto> hi
<Lambda> what's your job?
<Proto> It's a temp job, I'm helping paint a large building
<Ripred> 2hi lunies
<Lunies> Heyaaa
<Proto> the ends are shorter, maybe 1/2 the length of the building but several feet higher, took 3 and half hours for one of those with one roller
<Proto> And we /just/ started painting
<Proto> we pressure washed it yesterday
*Ripred 2pokes lunies with a stick of lead
<Lunies> Don't do that! I could get lead poisoning
<Corevette789> one roller?
<Proto> I was standing for every second of those three and a half hours in >90* weather...yay florida
<Ripred> 2:x
<Proto> all the guy in charge brought
<Ripred> 2i forgot how frail you humans are =/
<Corevette789> Thats gonna take a week
<Creideiki> You know, to avoid lead poisoning, all you need is a strict regimen of chelating chemicals.
<May> sounds not good
<Proto> nah, just a few more days
<Creideiki> (Of course you'll still get lead poisoning... but it might take a few years of more exposure.)
<Ripred> 2.-.
<Ripred> 2im imune to lead poisening
<May> no you aren't
<Ripred> 2i found the cure
<May> no one is immune
<Ripred> 2i am with my cure :P
<Creideiki> Also, for the lulz I read the 00,01infamous "04,01Boatmurdered" Let's Play of Dwarf Fortress.
<Quanyails> 7Back.
<Ripred> 2i hate dwarf fortress D:
<Creideiki> One bit of summary: "What does this lever do?" *thwump* *sizzle* *sniff sniff* "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED OUTSIDE! IT'S ALL ON FIRE!"
<Ripred> 2lol
<Ripred> 2guest!!!
<Guest1134474> not
<Ripred> 2oh..
<Creideiki> Yeah, you know your fortress is safe from goblin hordes when you have the "Outdoor Magma Death Lever" at your disposal. :P
<Ripred|SM64> 2hi HSM
<HyperMetalSonic> Hi
<Creideiki> (Warning: The Outdoor Magma Death Lever is not to be used outdoors.)
<Ripred|SM64> 2lol
<HyperMetalSonic> But that is the point!
<HyperMetalSonic> Trick them to pull it, and splash!
<Ripred|SM64> 2lol
<Ripred|SM64> 2bah
<HyperMetalSonic> Wow long gap
<Ripred|SM64> 2of words?
<Ripred|SM64> 2i know
<Ripred|SM64> 2....
<Ripred|SM64> 2im loosing mytouch
<Creideiki> Actually, the easiet way to use the Outdoor Magma Death Lever, is have it inside, and use it when the invading army enters the map.
<HyperMetalSonic> I was on Epicwinftw
<HyperMetalSonic> That it too easy!
<HyperMetalSonic> That us
<HyperMetalSonic> That is
<Creideiki> Unfortunately, badly mistimed invasions can also result in converting your friendly caravan merchants into crispy fried cinders. (Oops.)
<HyperMetalSonic> Don't forget the daily mailman!
<HyperMetalSonic> Those Mailboxes are deadly when armed.
*HyperMetalSonic always causes silence...
<Creideiki> Also... fun crazy things to do:
<HyperMetalSonic> What were talking about?
<Creideiki> Cast a giant Monolith out of obsidan in front of your front door. BEHOLD THE EIGHTEEN STOREY HIGH AWESOMENESS! :P
<Skylands> 10!sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
<Creideiki> :s/obsidan/obsidian
<Creideiki> Dwarf Fortress is hilarious.
<HyperMetalSonic> Strange question- Has anyone made a Lugia Mailbox?
<Ripred|SM64> 2HA its funny how apple thinks im going to rea a 62 page terms and agreemnt for an app
<Ripred|SM64> 2read*
<HyperMetalSonic> Think different...
<Creideiki> Every company wants you to read their EUAL.
<Creideiki> :s/EUAL/EULA
<Ripred|SM64> 2well i DONT
<Creideiki> Well, then you can't complain about the software borking. :P
<Creideiki> (Becuase you can't really complain about software that borks, and that you agreed to use the software that borks, because the software borking is spelled out in the EULA, and that the company that made the software is not responsible for it borking. :P )

<JLF> no lol
<JLF> furies
<AuraWindsrayquazaWhiteFeatherz> Srry got logged out
<JLF> another thing that makes no sense
<JLF> in new beginning the only fury that killed those commanders was earth fury
<Aurora> 6well
<JLF> in eternal night all the furies kill the commanders
<Aurora> 6favorite p[okemon
<Aurora> 6no limit on legendaries
<Aurora> 6it would be lugia and charizard (both are tied)
<JLF> that makes no sense
<Kaleb> My fav legend is probably rayquaza too, cuz I owned emerald wit him
<Aurora> 6dude, shorter name?
<nintendofreak> 12the later furies were stronger in anb
<Aurora> 6and stop changing your name please
<Espeon> sounds awesome
<Kaleb> Who? aura?
<JLF> oh cause the only strong fury in anb for me was earth
<Aurora> 6yes
<nintendofreak> 12it was the strongest thats why :p
<AiraWindsWhiteRayquaza11> I kept getting logged out and i forgot watt I set as my name
<JLF> even fully upgraded the other ones didn't kill the commanders
<Aurora> 6well
<nintendofreak> 12fire was weakest then electricity then ice then earth
<Aurora> 6that's why you-
<Aurora> 6:|
<Kaleb> Oh, and probably myy third would be staraptor cuz he owns
<Aurora> 6OK FEIN IGNORE ME
<Aurora> 6anyhoo
<Kaleb> Dang, man what's goin on
<Light_Latias> 12back

<SpooKy> !setgreet i'rpowpo'wc'huú :>
<Icydragon> 12Prince-dari: lulz idk hahahaha
<Kaleb> I just think salamence has been over hyped
<Prince-dari> My mIRC says I've had it for 9361 days.
<EarthQuaza> So u like the first generation?
<Prince-dari> Which makes no sense, because I'm not 25, and nor is my computer.
<Kaleb> I also like flygon though
<EpicStatsGuy> i'rpowpo'wc'huú :>
<EarthQuaza> Yeah
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<SpooKy> :o
<Icydragon> 12<.<
<EarthQuaza> All dragon types last evolutions
<JLF> nvm
<EarthQuaza> And legends
<Kaleb> Yeah, prob first gen cuz it was easier to get every pokemon
<Sneas> 03:3
<EarthQuaza> But I also like high hp normal type pokemon cuz they can know a variety of moves.
<SpooKy> i r powpow chu :>
<EarthQuaza> Lol only 4 people chatting
<Prince-dari> :o
<Kaleb> yeah, but normal moves arent super effective against anything
<EarthQuaza> I meant like nornal types can know blizzard,fire moves,electric moves,ETC.
<Kaleb> now whats ur fav game from Red all the way to white if uve played it
<EarthQuaza> Hmm
<Kaleb> I understand, normal types are awesome
<Kaleb> Firered for me cuz u had the same 151 and new moves and plot elements
<EarthQuaza> Well I never played any of the game boy color pokemon games only gameboy advance and ds.
<Icydragon> 12WHATS DA﻿ WORD ON DAT
<Prince-dari> Blue/red were awesome.
<JLF> huh?
<Kaleb> U other guys got anything to say
<EarthQuaza> Yeah I think I like fr lg r s e d p pltnm and hg ss haha all of them I've played I like
<Kaleb> sorry dari
<Icydragon> 12What?
<Kaleb> yeah lol
<EarthQuaza> But I don't hack er do action replay
<Kaleb> but there was one thing i didnt like about D/P/Pt
<EarthQuaza> Hmm?
<JLF> lol zeke and luther
<Kaleb> There was only one freaking fire type other than the starter and that was ponyta
<Icydragon> 12NO!NO! NOT THAT
<Kaleb> Infernape or rapidash was u choice
<EarthQuaza> 12Bacicly all games were like that
<Icydragon> 12Oh go I turned into Cyndi... aka the old me... wtf?
<JLF> lol
<Kaleb> what u mean?
<EarthQuaza> 12So I always had to do the fire type although I hate chitchat and torchic
<EarthQuaza> 12Chimchar
<EarthQuaza> 12I mean
<JLF> i sooo wanna see nanny mcphee returns
<Icydragon> 12Why would they do that?
<EarthQuaza> 12Like in fire red there wasn't any fire types exept ponyta way later in the game
<EarthQuaza> 12But leaf green was fine
<EarthQuaza> 12Vilpix
<Kaleb> First gen had magmar, arcanine, and vulpix. Second gen had houndoom and macargo. Third gen had torkoal and camerupt
<Icydragon> 12Well I'm not one to talk, I liked transformers 2. :L
<JLF> idk
<EarthQuaza> 12Well emerald had numel torkoal and slugma
<JLF> i g2g talk to u guys later
<Kaleb> where did light latias go?
<EarthQuaza> 12Shrugs
<Icydragon> 12Later!
*Light_Latias is still here...
<Kaleb> well, i had already said slugma for 2 gen though
<EarthQuaza> 4Does this count as a too light color that I'd get banned for?
<Aurora> 6no
<Kaleb> no. i can read it
<EarthQuaza> 4Kk
<Kaleb> Hey do u guys battle competetively?
<Icydragon> 12So...
<EarthQuaza> 4Yeah?
<EarthQuaza> 4What?
<Prince-dari> ...So.
<Aurora> 6not really
<EarthQuaza> 4What do u mean
<Kaleb> Well, do u guys care about nature, EV's and stuff?
<Aurora> 6I personally don't agree with what smogon has done to the pokemon games
<EarthQuaza> 4Oh that
<Kaleb> I don't really
<Kaleb> how so?
<EarthQuaza> 4No I don't give aboUt that
<Aurora> 6I'll look for the right nature, but I don't really care about EVs
<Prince-dari> People must talk. :o
<EarthQuaza> 4Gtg soon
<Aurora> 6well, smogon has made ALL the rules for "competitive" battling, from who's an uber and banned, to what moves are banned (including double team),
<Kaleb> I don't really care, I just pick awesome pokemon and just raise them as i see fit
<EarthQuaza> 4Why
<Kaleb> what u mean why?
<Aurora> 6and seriously EVERYONE will catch the right natured pokemon with the right IVs and then train them with max EVs, making the whole system voided
<EarthQuaza> 4Why do they ban moves etc if people use them still
<Aurora> 6well
<Kaleb> I never really use double team
<Aurora> 6if you battle through smogon
<Aurora> 6people don't use double team
<Aurora> 6because it's banned
<Kaleb> like shoddy battles
<EarthQuaza> 4I'm more of an attacker and none of my pokemon have other moves than ones that inflict dsm
<EarthQuaza> 4Damage
<EarthQuaza> 4Shoddy?
<Aurora> 6lol, all my pokemon are balanced for attacks and status moves
<Espeon> the pro way to go is pokesav
<EarthQuaza> 4Not mE I have a full team of 6lvl 100 salamence
<Espeon> and that's not even a joke
*Espeon dies
<Kaleb> yeah, sometimes I'll use agility or toxic, but im not muchof a spiker or stealth rock user
<Aurora> 6full team of salamece?
*Xeeshu pokes Kitten
<Espeon> suddenly ice beam
<Aurora> 6so, if I whip out my Lapras, what'll you do?
<Aurora> 6ice beam yes
<EarthQuaza> 4Yeah I raised then by transporting 6 bag on into platinum at the start of the game
<Kaleb> I prefer to have tyhe most types of pokemon who work well together
<EarthQuaza> 4Bagon
<Aurora> 6I choose favorites, tbh
<EarthQuaza> 4I mean
<Aurora> 6and work with what I have
<Espeon> what Aurora said. Most pokemon have SOME sort of potential
<Kaleb> me too, but i wont get like a team of 6 pikachus
<Aurora> 6of course, some of my favorites tend to be the powerhouses in some way
*Icydragon 12slaps Prince-dari.
<Espeon> Espeon isn't bad afterall.
<Aurora> 6Absol, Espeon, Jolteon, Tyranitar, etc
<Espeon> |D
<EarthQuaza> 4I just hate slamence don't know any elect. Moves or ice moves
<Kaleb> true, ex. arcanine
<Espeon> speedy Jolteons
<Aurora> 6espeon + psychic + shadow ball = dominance
<Espeon> xD
<Kaleb> true i did that and i owned
*Aurora 6nuzlockes
<EarthQuaza> 4Kaleb what was youR fire red team?
<Espeon> ffffffffff
<Espeon> if I nuzlocked and had an Espeon
<Espeon> and lost it
<Prince-dari> O_o
<Espeon> rageface
<Xeeshu> :P
<Aurora> 6lol
<Kaleb> which one I write my teams down for each starter
<Xeeshu> Prince-dari: do you speak Urdu ?
<Espeon> TRULY THOSE CRITS ARE PESKY
<Aurora> 6I think using eevee is against the nuzlocke rules though
<Prince-dari> Nope.
<Aurora> 6because it wasn't captured
<Icydragon> 12Dari's gay...
<Aurora> 6idk....it wasn't clear about that
<EarthQuaza> 4Firered your whole team of six pokemon
<Xeeshu> Prince-dari: any asian language?
<Icydragon> 12AHAHAHA
<Espeon> Some people go by traded Pokemon as counting in the "first Pokemon in a zone" rule
<Aurora> 6in the first season, groudon had to be destroyed
<EarthQuaza> 4Wat?
<Aurora> 6but the second one, lapras was put on the team
<Aurora> 6ah
<Prince-dari> Well, not really, my dad speaks Farsi.
<Espeon> a comic made of win
<Kaleb> I know but I have different teams for each starter
<Aurora> 6that started a revolution
<EarthQuaza> 4Oh
<Xeeshu> Prince-dari: then why would you go in that pakistani channel? #funnypaki ?
<Aurora> 6crap almost lost my poochyena there ._.
<EarthQuaza> 4Well what was ur charizard starter team?
<Prince-dari> I haven't?
<Kaleb> Ill brb
<EarthQuaza> 4Kk
<Espeon> he originally just planned to like do a few ironically badly drawn pages for /v/, but then it took off. Now it's a phenom
<Xeeshu> well, i've seen you there Prince-dari !
<Prince-dari> I highly doubt it.
<Prince-dari> Because I've never joined it.
<Xeeshu> lol
<Prince-dari> I have auto-accept invites on.
<Aurora> 6more importantly, one of the funnest versions of pokemon ever.
<Xeeshu> its ok
<Aurora> 6Ever.
<Xeeshu> i see
<Prince-dari> But I think I would have realised if I did.
<Xeeshu> Aye, i got it
<EarthQuaza> 4My team was: arcanine, dragonite, nidoking, raichu, executor, and blastoise.
<EarthQuaza> 4For fire red
<Espeon> what Roara said xD
<Espeon> and quite nice
<Kaleb> Charizard- Charizard,vaporeon,exxeggutor,dodrio,nidoking, and primeape
<Xeeshu> Prince-dari: is this dari the language Dari ?
<Espeon> basically Pokemon - Hard Mode
<EarthQuaza> 4Awesome
<Prince-dari> Nope, the name Darius.
<Kaleb> I'm kind of a nerd cuz I write em all down
<EarthQuaza> 4We had 2 of the same
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6I should get to work on page 3 of my nuzlocke archive
<Xeeshu> ahan
<EarthQuaza> 4Well, I do too cuz I want to remember my strategies when I start a new game
<Aurora> 6cuz I now have a team :|
<EarthQuaza> 4.
<Espeon> the fallen shall never be forgotten
<Espeon> asjdajfa
<Espeon> ok
<Kaleb> my best team of all was Blastoise, arcanine,exxeggutor,jolteon,pidgeot, and dugtrio
<Aurora> 6that's true
<Aurora> 6nuzleaf is still with ruby
<EarthQuaza> 4EarthquaZa

<Espeon> the correct way to say it is "I think x is better than y"
<deathbat> I think I could.
<deathbat> DeviantART here I come!
<Kjakings> 7she joined like two weeks ago
<Articuno> 12LOL AT PIC
<Lugia365> SC2 kept getting it's release date pushed back nd people got mad, so they trolled battle.bet until the beta was released lol
<Kjakings> 7OOOH. I may know a way to get Malefor!
<drf|work> Or the correct way is to say "X is better than Apple", and it will always be true
<Articuno> 12That reminds me, Ineed to watch that show on Youtube so I can actually see what people are finding so funny

<Kjakings> 7thanks is a shortened form of thank you
<Articuno> 12HAHA I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT WATERBOTTLE THING
<drf|work> and had to go change his phone number
<KyroTheAssassin> 4-_- feather isnt alive -_-
<drf|work> I was like LOLNICE
<drf|work> KyroTheAssassin, why are you such a stalker?
<JLF> i know that
<Kjakings> 7oh, Stacey. There's a new Hail.
<Aurora> 6lol it was hilarious
<drf|work> The point of a chat is to talk to people, not sit here and wait for someone
<deathbat> Hooray, I -WHAT
<deathbat> WHAT
<Aurora> 6drf, do you have the video link by any chance?
<JLF> Spyrorocks!
<deathbat> ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
<Kjakings> 7called Cyndi. apparently I'm racist because I told her to shut the fuck up for being loud
<drf|work> the water bottle one you mean?
<Prince-dari> [20:32] <JLF> Spyrorocks!
<KyroTheAssassin> 4im not a stalker O.o
<deathbat> Oh, Cyndi.

<Prince-dari> She used the 'n word' when she was in here last time.
<Articuno> 12DRF shut up, I complain about Lugia sometimes when he's not here, does that make me a stalker?
<Aurora> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjZvm7mYoI
<Aurora> 6ther
<deathbat> Duuuude |:
<Kjakings> 7her reasoning was that I told her to shut up for being loud. being loud is part of her. so, I told her to shut up for being herself. she claims to be black, so I told her to shut up for being black. therefor, Kja is racist
<deathbat> I've forgotten how Steve functions again. It's been so long~
<JLF> *coughs

<Raine> k!
*Quanyails 7is back.
<Andres> Apparently some gal thinks that I looked like Ronnie James Dio maybe half an hour ago. D: And she then touched my hair and complimented the healthiness of the hairlings. And it all happened after we had just gotten dressed after skinny dipping o.o
*Curly gives Andres a fork
<drfsupercenter> 03wb?
<Andres> Hai, Curly :)
<Curly> um... in context that could be totally misread >.>

<Curly> the bottom 30cm or so swing outwards and it's really hard to shut it if you open it all the way >_>
<Curly> actually, this whole pace is built really dumb :I
<Curly> place*
<Curly> oh, my bad, the bottom 60cm
<Aurora> 6holy crap that's the japanese version of the song?
<Aristeo> :3
<Aurora> 6so high pitched D:
<Lunies> What song, Aurora?
<Aurora> 6the japanese lavender city one
<Lunies> Ah
*Aristeo is tired
<drfsupercenter> 03sounds thes ame to me o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03*same
*Andres pets the Curly on the head.
<Andres> It is 2 am and I was told to run around with people from since like 6 pm ._.
<Curly> you sound like you have a fun life Andres :o
<Aurora> 6I don't know if you can hear the same frequencies as me
<Aurora> 6I apparently can hear higher than most
<Aurora> 6*most people
<mib_mmmyvx> back
<Andres> Maybe, except for the part that most people did not appear until 11 pm D:
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 <- OK WTF
<drfsupercenter> 03That story in there
<Aurora> 6and wow
<drfsupercenter> 03sounds made up to me
<Aurora> 6the story to Black version is bizarre
<drfsupercenter> 03that audio sounds *just* like the game to me
<Aurora> 6the story for the song sounds made up
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing odd there
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Aurora> 6but the black version one is awesome
<Aurora> 6drf, there are points that have some really high requencies
<Aurora> 6frequencies
<Curly> enjoy, Ari o/
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard some high stuff yeah
<Aurora> 6to some people, high enough to cause problems
<drfsupercenter> 03but wtf at seizures and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean like dogs?
<Aurora> 6sorta
<drfsupercenter> 03but people could actually die?
<Aurora> 6if they have epilepsy and it can be triggered by such high sounds yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought epilepsy was *visual*
<Aurora> 6no
<drfsupercenter> 03like the Porygon episode deal
<Aurora> 6er
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03well I can hear some high pitched sounds in that but I'm still alive
<Aurora> 6epilepsy as far as I know isn't just that
<Aurora> 6so can I, I'm still alive
<Aurora> 6we don't get seizures from it
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf @ that whooshing sound
<drfsupercenter> 03at like 3:00
<Aurora> 6technically, epilepsy is an overload of electric signals to the brain
<Aurora> 6so it could be triggered by sound as well
<drfsupercenter> 03._.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03what I don't get is
<drfsupercenter> 03if the dude remixed it
<drfsupercenter> 03how come he didn't just get seizures right aweay?
<drfsupercenter> 03*away
<drfsupercenter> 03he listened to it all that time before anything happened?
<Aurora> 6I guess
<Aurora> 6like i said, I don't believe the story
<Aurora> 6but it *IS* possible, I believe
<drfsupercenter> 03WTF
*Andres tacklefallhugs the Curly from the ceiling! :3
<drfsupercenter> 03at 8:50 it gets all weird
<Curly> O:
*Curly falls over
<drfsupercenter> 03<Yauncle> look at 8:50
<drfsupercenter> 03> yeah WTF was that
<drfsupercenter> 03<Yauncle> LEAVE NOW
<drfsupercenter> 03<Yauncle> it says
<drfsupercenter> 03> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03> yeah that's actually kinda giving me a headache
<Quanyails> 7WHOO, MIDI ANIMATIONS. O3o
<drfsupercenter> 03that's midi?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuIDm8vkB1I <- A little less headache-y
<Curly> I think I should go out for a walk
<Curly> need to do /something/ to make me feel like I haven't just sat in my house for 2 weeks >_>
<Curly> I'll be back in a bit
<Aurora> 6drf
<Aurora> 6on the 10 minute long movie
<Aurora> 6at 4:11 is a good point where there's some high frequency sounds
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> the other vid by the same uploader is an obvious fake
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> <&drfsupercenter> lul "The four people? who disliked this commited suicide" <-- someone should dislikebomb it
<drfsupercenter> 03> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> why would the Japanese version use English text which didn't exist at the time lol
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun> actually same @ the other one
<drfsupercenter> 03his other one is something about embedded images in the Ruins of Alph
<Andres> Have fun :o
<Armageddon> bye all
<Armageddon> and typically I AM usually cheerful
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I hear those @ 4:11
<Aurora> 6k, those are the highest on the file
<Aurora> 6unless youtube destroyed the actual frequencies
<Aurora> 6which could be possible
<Aurora> 6but yeah, I image some people could be affected by that, and if you have headphones
<Aurora> 6yeah
<KyroTheAssassin> -_- i dont know what the heck a hollerback girl is, but whatever it is, it should be drug out in the street and shot ~.~
<Glacymr> 12back
<KyroTheAssassin> wb
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjYIYcdH7rs <- LMAO
<drfsupercenter> 03<Aurora> but yeah, I image some people could be affected by that, and if you have headphones <- well a couple things that scream "obvious fake" to me
<Creideiki> I have a question... why do movie makers now intentionally try to sabotage the cinematography. I mean REALLY. LENS FLARE IS BAD PEOPLE! THE STEADICAM WAS INVENTED 04FOR A REASON! GETTING THE LENS DIRTY SHOULDN'T BE A GOOD THING! THAT SHOULD GET YOU FIRED! Excuse the rant.
<drfsupercenter> 031. The uploader claims he never listened to it... but yet around 8 minutes in you see some Unown saying "LEAVE NOW" and then it gets all weird sounding
<drfsupercenter> 03There's no way in heck an audio analysis program did that
<drfsupercenter> 03meaning somebody had to
<drfsupercenter> 03which means he had to have listened to it...
<KyroTheAssassin> brb

<Neon> Anyone around?
<Neon> Stormy, Prince-dari, Ryft, Aristeo?
<Neon> Hey. You made it.
<Cassie> I did.
<Neon> Again, not a good example. Everyone idle.
<Neon> Want to go to another channel?
<Neon> *everyone's
<Cassie> Does that mean I have to do all of that complicated [censored] again?
<Neon> Not really.
<Cassie> I'm such a noob xD
<Cassie> And okay.
<Neon> Just go back to the home tab and change your server and channel.
<Neon> It will get easier the more you do it.
<Cassie> Change it to what?
<Neon> Server (where it says IRC) Mibbit. Channel: #mibbit
<Neon> Easy.
<Cassie> Ah okay
<Neon> You can stay in this place, also.
<Aristeo> :o
<Neon> Hey, Aristeo.
<Aristeo> Hey!
<Neon> I brought a friend home.
<Aristeo> :D
*Aristeo waves to Cassie ^^

*Curly plops down with a sandwich and a beer

<Curly> apparently it's a "cream ale"
<Neon> she's figuring out Mibbit right now on another channel.
<Curly> you can't say I don't like alcohol for lack of trying >_>
<Proto> hehe
<Curly> also I must be a masochist or something
<Proto> :o
<Curly> stupid jerk. I can't help but keep reading that channel just in case people don't like him as much as I do but they never do >_>
<Curly> so... final verdict: beer still tastes horrible :X
*Proto dumps it out >.>
<Aristeo> :3
<Aristeo> Aww, my sweet innocent Curly drinking alcohol :(
<Proto> I wish I had punched the wall harder
<Curly> I try to figure out what people like about it whenever there's alcohol in the fridge >_>
<Proto> hehe
<Curly> I found that beer tastes best if you just toss it back so you can't taste it <_<
<Aristeo> Hi Sarikitty :)
*Curly curls up on Sari
<Cassie> >.>
<Cassie> Why hasn't my nickname changed in this channel?

<Neon> *nods* Makes sense/
<Neon> Need any help with commands?
<Cassie> Erm, okay.

<Neon> I've been told that.
<ixr> Its not good
<Curly> I feel sick >_>
<Curly> drank too fast x_x
<Neon> I apologize.
<ixr> Salright
<ixr> Might wanna tone it down though
<ixr> Unless you like scaring people too
<Neon> A little difficult.
<Neon> I do, actually.
<ixr> Ooh we have something in common
*GrimmSpider just drank 2 shots
<GrimmSpider> :D
<GrimmSpider> going for another in a min
<Aristeo> Curly: Why are you drinking alcohol? :o
<GrimmSpider> chris: y aren't u? :P
<Curly> I try every now and then to see if I like it :X
<ixr> How festive
<Aristeo> Why?
<Aristeo> Why do you want to like it?
*Aristeo offers Curly cokes instead
<Neon> Ha.
<Curly> I don't know >.>
<Neon> Well, we are not very alike, are we?
<GrimmSpider> i just poured 3 shots worth of gin into my iced coffee
<Curly> I'm crazy :x
<GrimmSpider> lol
<Lambda> neither of you ever make sense
<GrimmSpider> you're not crazy kari-chan
<Lambda> :P
<ixr> Most likely no
<Lambda> in that way all three of us are alike
<Neon> I make sense.
<Neon> An order within a disorder.
<ixr> Liar
<Neon> "In all disorder there is a secret order, in all chaos a cosmos."
*Neon shrugs.
<Aristeo> Curly: Marijuana is safer for you than alcohol
<Aristeo> Try that instead
<ixr> Dirty festive liar!
*Lambda points at Neon
<Lambda> my case rests
<Neon> Hehehe.
<Aristeo> :3
<Curly> I've tried, marijuana doesn't do anything for me :<
<Aristeo> And nothing is safer than marijuana :3
*Stormy slaps everyone with a 4r7a8i9n3b2o6w trout
<ixr> hmmm
<ixr> You festive storm
<Lambda> rainbow trout spin attack!
*Neon doesn't take kindly to terrorists,
*Neon resists fighting Stormalong.
<Cassie> 6Hmm
<Cassie> 6So you can see this colour?
<Neon> Of course.
<Neon> Plurpleberry.
<ixr> Gooseberry
*Aristeo also wonders why Curly has had an interest in doing drugs lately >.>
<ixr> 3black
<Neon> Boisonberry.
*Aristeo offers hot chocolate instead :D
<Neon> Cassie: so, do you like IRC thus far?
<Lambda> Elderberry
<ixr> Cyberry
<Lambda> Your father smelled of them
<Curly> I don't have an interest in drugs <.<
<ixr> Wtf is your issue lambda
<Lambda> I have no idea
*Aristeo points to alcohol
<ixr> That blows
<Cassie> 6Yeah, tt's better than the silly flash chat on the other website
<Cassie> 6it's*
<Neon> Lambda: Demotivation inspiration!
<Curly> well, I'm not really interested in alcohol so much as why people like it
<Neon> Has it been done?
<ixr> No
<Lambda> not that I know of
*Stormy waves to Cassie
<Neon> YES
<ixr> NO
<Neon> Oh, guys, I brought a friend home,
<Lambda> Hello Cassy
<Lambda> Cassie
<Aristeo> Okies :x
<Lambda> *
<Cassie> 6Hello
<ixr> Len hw ti typ
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> I think wine tastes okay
<Stormy> I haven't tried any other kinds of alcohol though
<ixr> 4hello Cassie
<Cassie> 6Hello.
<ixr> rdx
*Lambda has never tried any of it
<Neon> She's a government agent I hired to check up on you guys.
<Lambda> unless beer when I was three and wine at church count
<ixr> Pfft
<Aristeo> Oh, hehe
<ixr> I would have already seen and got rid of her
<Lambda> otherwise I see no point in any of it
<Neon> You're overestimate your own prowess.
<Aristeo> Oh, there's lots of points to it :3
*Aristeo still doesn't recommend it :3
<Spyrorocks> I have a theory that a lot of young people only like alcohol because it is entertaining to their friends./
<ixr> Underestimate is more the worf
<ixr> Word
<Lambda> I agree with this theory
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks: You might be right
<Neon> :P Which in turn shows your overestimation.
<ixr> Think what you want
<ixr> You are wrong
<Neon> I'm frequently wrong; not the issure here.
<Neon> *issue
<Spyrorocks> My grandparents on my dad's side don't have any alcohol in their house
<Spyrorocks> and out of respect for them we don't have it at our house when they come over
<ixr> Not an issue no
<Spyrorocks> they drink a ton of soda though...
<ixr> But its here
<Spyrorocks> its crazy, probably more than they drink in mexico.
<Neon> It is?
<ixr> Can you not see it?
<Neon> I'm a blind, old man. xD
<Neon> I can't even see my bran flakes.
<Lambda> hehehe
<Cassie> 6Lol
<ixr> Ahh death is around the corner then eh?
<Aristeo> My mom is against alcohol quite a bit -- I think her grandfather on her mom's side was an alcoholic or something
<ixr> And how do you know those are even bran flakes then?
<Aristeo> Hey where
<where> Hey Aristeo
<Neon> Because I trust my butler, Chives.
<Stormy> No one in my family is at all against alcohol
<Lambda> aka dari?
<Lambda> no wait
<Neon> However, I would like it very much to die.
<ixr> You shouldnt
<Aristeo> Not too much against it, just doesn't want it in the house
<Neon> No, he's Jeeves.
<Lambda> he'sm the butler of Stormy and my mansion, isn't he?
<ixr> I own thw company
<ixr> The
<ixr> I could arrange that
<Neon> The company's jurisdiction does not extend here.
*Aristeo is just against societal comfort of alcohol, especially when it's safer than drugs that are societal taboos
*Aristeo doesn't like hypocracy :x
<ixr> Thats what ypu were told
<ixr> You
<Neon> I know it, because I formed the company.
<Neon> With my own Play Doh
<where> How is that hypocritical?
<where> Although true
<ixr> Your mind is slipping to
<Neon> I cannot account for the memories that elude me as my mind deteriorates.
<Neon> But I can only trust Alfred and myself.
<Stormy> Aristeo, you mean the drugs are safer?
<Lambda> Alfred chives?
*Neon nods.
<ixr> Its always the butler that did it
<Neon> Only in the stories, young xr.
<Neon> *ixr
<Lambda> in the kitchen
<Lambda> with the bar of soap
<Neon> In Soviet Russia, butler do you.
<Lambda> with Colonel Mustard's assistance
<ixr> Hell if there was a butler in clue hed always be the one to do it
<Neon> XD
<Aristeo> Well, in the US, for example, marijuana is outlawed in most states, but alcohol is not. Marijuana is actually a safer drug than alcohol, and yet, marijuana use can land you in jail, alcohol use is accepted in society, and quiet often encouraged
<Neon> I thought there was.
<ixr> Only in stories lil neon
<where> Ah.
<where> anyway, brb.
<Aristeo> kk
<Stormy> Never tried it, so I can't really say if it's safer or not
<Aristeo> Well, I mean, if you think about it -- alcohol often leads to sexual assaults and domestic violence, and you don't have those issues with marijuana
<Aristeo> At least, I never heard of anyone who became high on marijuana and beat someone up
<Lambda> you just have stoners spacing out and getting hungry
<Aristeo> Exactly
<Neon> The stories lie. They lie to us all. Fiction is the new fact.
<Lambda> and addicted
<Lambda> and their brain cells slowly killed off if I'm not mistaken
<Lambda> although alcohol does that too
<ixr> The worlds full of liars
*Lambda has a stoner friend
<ixr> Like that activision [censored]
<Aristeo> Well, you can really get addicted with anything, including on World of Warcraft or IRC -- the real question to ask is, how much of a chemical addiction does marijuana lead to, and how much does alcohol lead to
<Neon> Liars are full of the world.
<Lambda> he isn't exactly the best and brightest of America
<Aristeo> Heh
<Lambda> he's fun to hang out with
<ixr> I lie you lie we all lie
<Lambda> when he isn't high that is
<ixr> Its nature
<Lambda> but even then
<Neon> For lielipops.
<Lambda> he is never in a proper state of mind
<Aristeo> The studies I've seen show that marijuana is less addictive than caffiene
<ixr> They are delicious
<Lambda> I can believe that
<Aristeo> It goes: marijuana, caffiene, alcohol, nicotine, heroin
<Lambda> it may not be scientifically addictive
<ixr> Thrilling
<ixr> And pleasing
<Neon> But not nutricious.
<Aristeo> chemically addictive :3
<Lambda> but it's affects might be addictive on a different way
<Lambda> right
<Lambda> that's what I meant
<Aristeo> Yeah, that's a good point
<Lambda> *effects
<Aristeo> Like in the way that WoW is addictive
<ixr> Nothing is anymore
<Lambda> exactly
<ixr> So it doesnt hurt much
<Lambda> they get addicted to that state of mind
<Lambda> but not the drug itself
<Aristeo> That's actually a very good point
<Neon> I like it when it... hurts.
<ixr> Pain in the best feeling little one
<Neon> I'm ninetey-seven-years old. ixr. do you know how long it takes to get that old?
<ixr> Its almost the only one that doesnt makes cringe
<Neon> *ninety
<Aristeo> I'm not advocating drug use, btw >.>
<Lambda> okay good
<ixr> 18 years and a few beers
<Lambda> just saying it's better than alcohol?
<Stormy> So you're advocating not using both alcohol and illegal drugs
*Ryft|SC2 sends a fleet of immortals after ixr and Neon
<Lambda> :D
*Lambda is spared
<Neon> Immortals, eh?
<Neon> We'll put their names to the test.
<ixr> Whos to say were not ones
<Ryft|SC2> Heavy Stalkers with increased Firepower and shields
<Ryft|SC2> They would tear you to pieces
<Ryft|SC2> Plus
<Neon> Haha, you have Satrcraft on the brain, man.
*Ryft|SC2 adds a few Void Rays to the mix
<Neon> *Starcraft
<Ryft|SC2> I'm playing it
<Ryft|SC2> SC@
<Ryft|SC2> *2
<Aristeo> I'm saying that the societal acceptance of alcohol is bad and that alcohol is actually a pretty dangerous drug
<Ryft|SC2> StarCraft2
<Neon> I'm aware.
<Neon> Just pointing it out.
<ixr> Bwha i was think WOW
<Ryft|SC2> OF COURSE I HAVE IT ON THE BRAIN
<Lambda> I agree with that
<Neon> Like, right on top of it? Or more interior?
<Lambda> but it seemed like you were saying the opposite about marijuana
<Ryft|SC2> Yes
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> sort of
<Stormy> It seems to me like it's only dangerous to certain people
<Stormy> People who don't know how to control themselves with it
<Lambda> but it can be do anyone
<Stormy> and people who might be predisposed to becoming alcoholics
<Neon> To which?
<Lambda> *to
<Tripp> hi ixr
<ixr> Hello
<Tripp> how are u?
<Aristeo> I was using marijuana as a comparison point, since the societal conception of marijuana is that it's a bad drug, as opposed to alcohol
<ixr> Surviving you?
<Ryft|SC2> It was an overall answer
<Neon> Can't be both.
<ixr> Why not
<Tripp> good
<Tripp> why u surviving?
<Neon> If it is directly on top, it cannot be interior.
<Aristeo> Of course, doing nothing is safer than all of the above :3
<Ryft|SC2> Unless part of it is interior, and another part is on top
<Lambda> Stormy: I agree, but how does someone know if it's dangerous for them until it's too late?
<Tripp> hard day?
<Aristeo> "Nothing" is non-addictive, has no withdrawl symptoms, and you can't become intoxicated over it
<Neon> But was that specified? Nah.
<Lambda> in my opinion it's better to not even risk it
<Stormy> How would I know? I don't have an alcohol problem. :P
<Aristeo> :3
<Neon> So I don't know.
<ixr> Umm it means im doing well enough
<ixr> Sure
<Tripp> oh sry
<Tripp> lol
<ixr> You new here?
<Lambda> I know
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> but that's the reason I don't plan on drinking
<ixr> What do you know
<Neon> Nothing more than you allow me to.
<Aristeo> I'll probably do marijuana before I start drinking :3
<ixr> Good deal
<Lambda> I can't think of any experiences I've had with drunks that were good
<Lambda> and I don't want to risk becoming one
<Tripp> nope
*Aristeo doesn't plan on it though
<Tripp> i'm JLF
<Stormy> It's not like you're going to become drunk after one drink
<Neon> My reasoning is limited to your permission, it seems.
<ixr> Ohhh
<Stormy> My family drinks with meals all the time
<Stormy> Seems pretty harmless to me
<ixr> Why tripp?
<Aristeo> It's not like you're gonna become a stoner after one joint
<Lambda> no but considering the possibility of being addicted, it can become harder and harder to stop for some people
<ixr> It is
<Lambda> and I just don't want to risk that for myself
*Aristeo has a pretty addictive personality
*Aristeo doesn't do anything with moderation
*Aristeo can't think of that last thing he did while exercising moderation
<Tripp> just needed a diff nickname
<Lambda> my dad drinks with meals all the time
<Lambda> but my mom does not
<Tripp> plus he's the main character of my fav show
<Lambda> because it doesn't take her much to get drunk
<Lambda> and she doesn't want to be drunk in front of my sister and I
<Aristeo> :3
*Aristeo is probably addicted to caffiene :x
<Lambda> I'm not saying there's a problem with people who drink in moderation
<GrimmSpider> people who are high on weed don't do bad things. they're too busy eating munchies and playing videaogames
<GrimmSpider> lol
<Lambda> just that when someone starts drinking they're taking a chance
<Aristeo> GrimmSpider: With your extensive experience with drugs, which do you think is more dangerous: alcohol or weed?
<GrimmSpider> alchohol
<Lambda> because they don't know their own liklihood of getting addicted
<Aristeo> GrimmSpider: Final answer?
<Aristeo> Lambda: I'd prolly be an alcoholic if I ever started drinking >.>
<GrimmSpider> make sure someone else has the keys and u'll be fine
<ixr> Qh
<ixr> Ah*
<ixr> you know i think that justin long of yours is gonna be a charcter in a movie coming up
<ixr> Looks very stupid though
<ixr> Your mind is mine
<Aristeo> Hi DarkTruth!
<GrimmSpider> do u know how many hits it would take to od on pot?
<Tripp> oh going the distance?
<Aristeo> GrimmSpider: So many that it's practically impossible?
<Tripp> it looks cute
<Tripp> i like some romantic comedy movies
<GrimmSpider> it's somewhere around 1,517
<ixr> I think were thinking of different movies
<Tripp> oh? what movie are u thinking of?
<ixr> Its calles Alpha and Omega
<DarkTruth> hey

<Tripp> looks bad animation wise
<ixr> Bwha! Looks like every other movie with animals in it
<Tripp> lol
<GrimmSpider> ......
<Tripp> they made the wolves look ugly
<ixr> So cliche

<ixr> Not always but usually
<ixr> Ok no hardley ever
<Tripp> lol
<ixr> Lol i like collecting stuff in most games
<ixr> As long as they have at least one purpose
<Tripp> well in hero's tail u gotta collect light gems
<Tripp> and dragon eggs
<ixr> Light gems sound wierd
<Tripp> yea
<ixr> But eggs are cool
<Tripp> to collect them u need to do mini games
<Tripp> which i hate
<ixr> Yummy too
<Tripp> i'm not one who likes collecting crap
<ixr> Bad mini games?
<Tripp> i prefer TLOS
<Tripp> kinda
<Tripp> the mini games fit each level
<ixr> You collect things in DotD
<Tripp> like this swamp level in hero's tail has u shooting critters
<Tripp> yeah but in dotd it's easy
<Tripp> plus no mini games in dot
<Tripp> *dotd

<Cassie> 6I guessed that
<Cassie> 6Are they any other decent channels?
<Cassie> 6there*
<Neon> Yeah, there's a few. Also on Mibbit there is an international channel, #chat. As for epic-chat... well, list it.

<Aristeo> Girls who type in blue are okay in my book too
<Aristeo> According to ancient Chinese proverb, "A girl who types in blue is pretty good for you. A girl who types in pink is headed for the shrink."
<Aristeo> I'm not sure about black though
<Aristeo> "A girl who types in black ..... has a nice rack?"
<Aristeo> "A girl who types in green is kind of mean?"

<Inokis> lol
<DarkTruth> every time she calls she brings that up
<Aristeo> FFXI!
<Aristeo> Do I know you from FFXI?
*Aristeo was on the Alexander server several years ago
<Inokis> i only lvld a toon to 17 solo before i decided it was too grindy i only knew two ppl so probably not
<Inokis> i only played for 30 days
<Aristeo> You remember what server you were in? :o
*Aristeo was a tarutaru ^^
*Aristeo had the red mage clothes :3
<Inokis> probably wasn't that one if you name them i can tell you which one it was
<Inokis> oh nm
<Inokis> you were a tarutaru
<Inokis> derr
<Aristeo> http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/dyn/server-status.html
<Inokis> misread it
<Aristeo> I was on Shiva for a while, then deleted my character and went to Alexander
<Inokis> im pretty sure it was bahamut
<Inokis> i played one of the oversized lizard looking ogre thingys
<Aristeo> ooooooo, okay
*Aristeo loved the red mage artifact armor
<Aristeo> Once I got it, it was like, mission achieved, I can quit now
<Inokis> i wanted to unlock dancer and the beast tamer but
<Inokis> i didn't get to it
<Inokis> i like to solo and that game is too grindy for that
<Aristeo> Yeah :/
<Inokis> i r not good with ppls
<Inokis> he was a monk/warr
<Aristeo> I didn't like going around spamming "{Tarutaru} {Red Mage}/{White Mage} LVL 52 LFP -- PLEASE {Invite} I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HOURS"
<Inokis> lol
<Inokis> what do you play now
<Aristeo> IRC
<Aristeo> nothing, really
<Inokis> ive always got a game
<Aristeo> And then once you got into a party, it was just CTRL+A, wait, .............. CTRL+A, wait.......... etc
<Inokis> if i unsup to an mmo i fall back on free ones
<Inokis> unsub rather
<Inokis> i tried allods yesterday
<Inokis> but it wouldn't let me use custom mouse buttons for alternate skill trays
<Inokis> so i ditched it
<Aristeo> And if you were a mage, it was like CTRL+1, CTRL+2, .... wait.... CTRL+1, CTRL+2, .... wait....
<Inokis> i liked the gameplay
<Inokis> and i loved the gamepad support for it
<Inokis> it was a great game the xp pentalties for soloing were just screwed up
<Aristeo> "omg u n00b u dun use provoke unless you need to lol"
<Inokis> lol
<Inokis> most ppl quit soloing by 10 i made it to 17
<Aristeo> Once you get to 10, soloing gets kinda difficult -- monsters that are a difficult challenge usually can beat you up
<Inokis> yep i didn't run into that til about 15
<Inokis> monks are sturdy
<Inokis> by 17 it was getting to be a crapshoot whether i could win a white con fight
<Aristeo> Everything is just so slowwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Inokis> indeed
<Inokis> and xp loss on death
<Aristeo> It gets slower and slower as you progress
<Inokis> not good
<Aristeo> It grinds to a halt at level 50
<Inokis> yep thats one of the reasons i was hesitant to continue solo you get 1000 xp for a mob at 75 just the same as you do at 10
<Aristeo> And everything looks the same :/
<Inokis> as far as the mob models?
*Aristeo nods
<Inokis> i thought it was a beautiful game honestly.
<Inokis> but i tweaked the ini file
<Aristeo> The scenery was beautiful
<Inokis> to make it less shimmer
<Inokis> so it wasn't quite an eyesor
<LoopyDood> Which game?
<Inokis> ffxi
<Aristeo> The scenery was beautiful but the monsters were all the same
<LoopyDood> Haven't played it.
<Aristeo> Once you get past level 30, you've seen all the monsters
<Inokis> lol
<Aristeo> A level 80 goblin looks exactly like a level 3 goblin
<Inokis> aren't they coming out with another ff mmo
*Aristeo nods
<Aristeo> I might try that one out
<Aristeo> Hey Cjman!

<Inokis> nothing in the eye is friendly
<Inokis> hard enough it can even be deadly
*Light_Latias sighs

<Inokis> it burns

<char> sure my parents would be cool with that
<LaptopAristeo> And since I'm going up there with the Phi Theta Kappa president, and since she's a girl, and since the school would rather pay twice as much on hotel fees than let us room together and risk a public relations disaster, I'll prolly have a room to myself

<Spyrorocks> why dont you you go yourself, then you can stay in any room you'd like.
<Spyrorocks> (not with the group)
<LaptopAristeo> Umm
<Spyrorocks> or is it a group thing
<LaptopAristeo> It's likely just going to be me and the PTK president
<Spyrorocks> whats PTK? I know you said what it stood for before
<char> brb
<Spyrorocks> but what is it
<LaptopAristeo> It's basically an honors society
<LaptopAristeo> For two-year colleges
<Spyrorocks> alright
<LaptopAristeo> They do stuff, but the point of joining is for the scholarships
<Spyrorocks> ah
<Spyrorocks> extra perks?
<LaptopAristeo> Well, yeah, you get special honors at graduation and you get to put it down on your resume
<Spyrorocks> I put a lot of things on my resume.
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, same here
<Spyrorocks> even the smallest things I do I blow them way out of prportion :P
<char> back
<LaptopAristeo> Same here xD
<LaptopAristeo> Like, all the awards I won for technology competitions when I was like eight
<LaptopAristeo> I made a video game once called "The Diamond of Ages" or something like that
<Spyrorocks> Ive made really crappy games with gamemaker a while back
<LaptopAristeo> Using a video game kit, didn't do any programming,
<Spyrorocks> "professional game developer"
<Spyrorocks> man I want an invite to google app inventor so bad
<Spyrorocks> you can make android apps so easy apparently.
<LaptopAristeo> I mostly talked about my accomplishments in AYSO for my college resume -- I said that I was the youngest referee assessor in the south eastern United States, which was probably true
<Spyrorocks> I talk a lot about my online endavours
<Spyrorocks> and some volenteer work, apparently people like to see a bit of that.
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah
<Spyrorocks> and ive done a bit of retail too
<Spyrorocks> so ive got a lot of bases covered.
*LaptopAristeo likes how he can be among the 25 most qualified scocer referees in North Alabama based on experience and practical knowledge, and yet, a handful spectators, who knows how much experience he has, feel like they know what they're talking about enough to shout out "bad call ref" onto the field, even thoguh they're 50 yards away and I'm within 5 yards away from the play
<char> soccer*
*char has more exp that laptoparisteo at being a grammar nazi
<LaptopAristeo> It's like, if the roles were reversed, and at their place of work at McDonalds, you wouldn't see me telling them that the pickles go on before the sauce >.>
<Spyrorocks> peopleare just angry.
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, it's an emotional game for some people, I guess
<LaptopAristeo> I've never really understood how people can get so emotional over youth sports
<LaptopAristeo> If you don't know what you're looking at, though, I suppose some things in soccer can seem unfair
<LaptopAristeo> Referees have to look at the cause of something, not the result -- if little Johnny falls down, it's not necessarily a foul, even if he gets a booboo
<LaptopAristeo> Or tripping is another good one -- sure, it's illegal to trip, but it's not illegal when someone doesn't look out where they're going and fall over someone's foot like an idiot :P

<RedDragonX> unless you're a manager
<InfamousZed> hell at heart we would have sold our souls...
<Majesty> stands by him
<Stormy> It really isn't that bad
<Stormy> Just a lot of repetitive work
<Icydragon3D> 12:)
<RedDragonX> I can't work with morons
<RedDragonX> I go nuts if I do
<Stormy> I think of it this way
<InfamousZed> if your doing it for a living it can be bad as you dont get very much respect from the higher ups
<Lambda> maintenance isn't all that repetitive really
<Majesty> barks: what do you want to do?
<Lambda> :P but it's maintenance
<Lambda> so how fun can that be
<Icydragon3D> 12I don't know...

<Stormy> :P
<InfamousZed> lambda sees a new pile a poo every day
<Majesty> lays in grass
*LaptopAristeo has a kitty next to him :)

<Majesty> hold on
<InfamousZed> if no one hinders me i'll do pretty good but if someone starts messing with me then friction is gona grind
<Lambda> they do their job, I do mine
<Stormy> I get annoyed with some of the guys I work with

<Lambda> Hahaha

<Lambda> remember the first time you guys talked about bales and I thought you meant hay bales?
<InfamousZed> i swear... i'm the only one in the store that doesnt mind makeing a cardboard bale
<Stormy> Like it actually mattered if he was doing the right thing
<Stormy> I don't mind it

<Stormy> I hate when they tell us we don't have the right size and make us use different ones
<Majesty> 5gets up
<Lambda> peg hooks?

<Majesty> 5tackles him
<Stormy> those bars that merchandise hangs on
<Lambda> ah

<Majesty> 5i know ROTFL
<InfamousZed> our store just rotated co managers and i hope i can keep my mp3 player
<Lambda> haha
*Icydragon3D 12tackles Majesty while she distracted.
<Lambda> oh InfamousZed
<Lambda> before I forget
<LaptopAristeo> Inokis: 8
<Lambda> what's a picklist?
<InfamousZed> if not... then i guess i may be there shorter than i would think
<InfamousZed> pick list?
<LoopyDood> http://shaymin.epic-chat.net/funny/Grudge%20Monkey.jpg
<Inokis> yes?
<LoopyDood> XD
<InfamousZed> a list of songs you want in order
<Lambda> I always heard the instock people talking about it
<Inokis> oh same age as mine
<Majesty> 5gets up and tackles him back
<Stormy> I saw a pick list by the telxon batteries today
<InfamousZed> oh wait..,.
<Stormy> but I couldn't make any sense of it
<Icydragon3D> 12Hehe...
<InfamousZed> are you talking about music or stocking
<InfamousZed> lol
<Lambda> stocking
<Lambda> :P
<Icydragon3D> 12*kisses*
<Majesty> 5looks at him and smiles
<InfamousZed> the picklist is greenzone which was stock that was run that wouldn't go on the shelf that has been bined and then taken out to be run for the next night out
<Icydragon3D> 12;D
<Lambda> so
<InfamousZed> if a whole case of cheerios wont go out you send it back to the back and later someone in the back will pick it on the pick list and send it back to you on a later night
<Lambda> basically it's the extra items that don't need to be stocked that night?
<Majesty> 5howls
<InfamousZed> yeah
<Majesty> 5gets up
<InfamousZed> the shelf is full and you cant get any more in its spot so you send it to the back
<Majesty> 5cudles him
<Lambda> oh okay
*Arcanine yawns
*Icydragon3D 12cuddles back.
<Lambda> I would always here all the instock people over the intercom
<Lambda> "Aisle 12 is done, moving on to pick list"
<InfamousZed> really?
<InfamousZed> we dont do that
<Lambda> and later "Aisle 12 pick list is done, moving on to aisle 13"
<Stormy> I don't think we even have an intercom
<Stormy> I've never heard it
<Lambda> woah, really?
<Lambda> every ten seconds it's going off at mine
<Icydragon3D> 12Btw I added you on yahoo
<Majesty> 5ok
<Stormy> employees just communicate with the walkies
<InfamousZed> we have an intercom but people never talk into it properly so its used with no effect
<Stormy> "Manger Brad line one please, Manager Brad line one"
<Majesty> 5if i can find u on myspace ill add u if u want me too anyway
<Lambda> yeah at ours the walkies are pretty much just for the managers and supervisors
<Lambda> the associates use the intercom to communicate
<Stormy> they need to give me one
<Icydragon3D> 12You can add me, but I never go one, I only made one because my brother made me.
<Stormy> so I don't have to run around the store to find a department manager every time a customer needs help
<Majesty> 5ok
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> or your store needs an intercom
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> listen at the winona walmart sometime
<InfamousZed> HELP NEON!!! ITS THA WALMART!
<Icydragon3D> 12Why you comin' home five in the mon' "Stupid lyrics'
<Lambda> you'll hear the intercom saying "Customer assistance needed in blah blah blah department"
<Lambda> all the time
<Neon> Those fools have no idea that I would never let them destroy the Walmart.
<LaptopAristeo> He's just so adorable
<RedDragonX> Wal Mart and Google shall battle for world domination
<LaptopAristeo> He's so introverted, but sometimes he goes *mew* and sits next to me :3
<Suicune> http://i35.tinypic.com/25qcaww.png
<Majesty> 5huh??
<Lambda> hmmm

<Lambda> I dunno which I'd root for
<Icydragon3D> 12Nevermind.
<Lambda> probably Google
<Stormy> I'll fight on Google's side only if they employ me
<Stormy> :P
<Majesty> 5lol
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> there you go
*Icydragon3D 12cuddles Majesty.
<Lambda> make it your rules
<InfamousZed> stormy has a conflict of interest
<Neon> Walmart would be the Sparta to Google's Athens.
<Majesty> 5cuddles backness
<Lambda> XD
<Icydragon3D> 12I'm just in a loving mood right now...
<Lambda> Walmart has the army and Google has the brains?
<Neon> Exactly.
<Majesty> 5lol same
<RedDragonX> wow that actually makes sense
<Stormy> it does
<Lambda> amazing right
<Neon> However, Stormy should side with Walmart, then, because at least there women have rights.
<Lambda> Neon making sense
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> hahaha
<Stormy> women don't have rights with google?
<Stormy> Since when?
<Neon> Lambda: It's a rare thing; keep it while you can.
<Lambda> no he means in Athens they don't
<Stormy> oh
<Stormy> derp
<Majesty> 5im not going to be here sat tho.
<Majesty> 5:(
<Inokis> mine is a calico they're always a bit wonky
<InfamousZed> yeah greeks are bad with women
<Neon> *didn't
<Lambda> but in Sparta the women were regarded as more important than the men
<Icydragon3D> 12:O
<Inokis> she wants what she wants when she wants it but try to give her attention otherwise
<Neon> One word: Breeders.
<Inokis> and ull lose your face or worse
<Majesty> 5i wont have any way to talk 2 u :(
<Neon> If you were sterile, you were no use.
<Stormy> :(
<Neon> :/
<Majesty> 5sighness
<Lambda> just like their men
<Neon> Lol.
<Lambda> if you were weak
<Lambda> no use
<Lambda> down the pit for you
<Stormy> I was about to say I'd go live there
*InfamousZed kicks lambda into teh pit
<Neon> Lambda: They actually favored the women so they'd produce healthy men. xD
<Icydragon3D> 12*sighs with you...ness.
<Majesty> 5lol
<Neon> Such a fail cycle.
<Stormy> But... >.>
<Lambda> didn;t they actually examine the babies and decide how worthy they were?
<RedDragonX> yes
<Icydragon3D> 12You'll be ok..
<Neon> Yeah, or, just like 300, you were cast aside.
<InfamousZed> theyd also throw them down a mountain
<Majesty> 5okness
<Majesty> 5:)
<Majesty> 5:P
<Lambda> yeah if they were unworthy
<RedDragonX> and actually the cycle worked quite well for awhile lol
<Majesty> 5:E
<Majesty> 5oops
<Majesty> 5lol
<Lambda> Stormy: Sparta kinda sucks
<Neon> Sometimes they'd leave them outside and if the elements didn't finish them they'd be reclaimed.
<Icydragon3D> 12Tounge!!!!
<RedDragonX> They had a very powerful society in their hayday
<Lambda> women's rights, sure
<InfamousZed> i guess its sort of an artificial selection
<Suicune> sleep. *amsg*
<Stormy> Yeah, sounds like it
*Stitch has a calico!
<Icydragon3D> 12Haha :E
<Lambda> but only for the good enough women
<RedDragonX> and actually survival of the fitest is what the world truly thrives on
<Majesty> 5LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Neon> They raped, except Greece only feel because it had no sense of unity.
<Neon> *fell
<RedDragonX> by using it they ensured they were always the strongest
<Icydragon3D> 12<:3
<Neon> Sparta ruined it for them all by not aiding the other polises when it could have.
<Lambda> also the gods ruined it by being jerkfaces
<RedDragonX> When did Sparta not aid them
<Lambda> :P
<Majesty> 5hold on my ANNOYING FRIEND IS STILL TXTING MEH!!!!!! I HATE HER> IM GOING TO KILL HER... *killes other kristen*
<RedDragonX> The only time they didn't was in the first Persian war when they didn't arrive on time for the battle of Marathon
<Neon> At the fall of Greece, forgot who their mutual enemy was.
<Icydragon3D> 12o.O
<RedDragonX> All nations in Greece did at that point
<RedDragonX> Macedonia was too strong and all Greek Nations were independent, as they were when the Romans invaded
<Neon> They were coming from the east, and Athens was their gateway inside to the other city-states.
<Neon> By not helping out Athens, they let the enemy in, and stronger.
<Icydragon3D> 12Jizz in my pants= PURE WIN
<RedDragonX> which war are you referring to
<Majesty> 5LOL!!!!!
<RedDragonX> only time Athens fell was during the Second Persian war when they evacuated it in order to prevent a Persian Victory
<Neon> Can't remember the name.
<Neon> I'll look it up.
<RedDragonX> by that point the Spartans had already been to Thermopolea
<Stormy> blarg
<Lambda> blarg?
<Icydragon3D> 12*pounces*
<RedDragonX> and they assembled their army to battle at Platea while the Athenian fleet was victorias at Salamis
<Neon> But I'm bored of discussing this anyway, haha.
<Stormy> brb
<Lambda> k
<Neon> This is not an admittance of defeat.
<LaptopAristeo> My kitty has gray and black and a little bit of brown :3
<RedDragonX> I know my classical military history well

<Inokis> she was the most antisocial and stupid cat
<Lambda> Stormy and I had a pretty epic Mass Effect discussion with Kja the other day
<InfamousZed> @quote
<Inokis> she never learned what windows were
<Steve> 4***[ QUOTE ] *** 12 <prince-dari>: Die SR <prince-dari>: I mean...Hi SR.
<Neon> Wait, she likes it now? xD
<Inokis> she would constantly jump at the window after the birds
<Lambda> She does

<Neon> D: Well, KJ must have been abrasive.
*Icydragon3D 12nuzzles Majesty
<Neon> Sorry, I'm unobservant.
<Lambda> after she played it
<Inokis> and she had a bare foot fetish. if you had socks on you were fine but if you tried to walk around without socks
<Neon> *in
<InfamousZed> i tired to get her to console kjak but she didnt feel up to it
<Inokis> you weren't going anywhere
<Lambda> nah, no need to apologize
<Lambda> console him?
<Neon> Don't tell me whgat to do.
<Lambda> for why?
<Neon> xD
<Neon> *what
<InfamousZed> with his questions
<Stitch> XD
<Lambda> ah
<Inokis> sadly after i joined the military my dad let all the cats go wiled and she ended up in the gutter
<Stitch> Cupcake attacks anything inanimate that moves.
<Majesty> 5nuzzles
<InfamousZed> he woulnd shut up about them
<Majesty> 5back
<InfamousZed> wouldn't
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> well maybe now he will
<Neon> Kjakings always tries to talk about Mass Effect with me, but I have no idea what he's saying.
<Stitch> She'll attack anything that is hidden under blankets; such as feet.
<Lambda> now that he has been able to talk to her and I about it
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> I just feign interest and understanding.
<Lambda> really?
<Lambda> wow
<Neon> Mhm.
<InfamousZed> as soon as i get annother laptop ill buy both games
<Lambda> I suppose my better half and I are the only ones who really have a clue what he's saying when he does
<Neon> I kind of want DragoneAge.
<Neon> BioWare makes good stuff.
<Lambda> they do
<Neon> *dragon
<Majesty> 5so florida huh? has it been hot around there?
<InfamousZed> my bro says dragon age wasnt all that good for him
<Lambda> Dragone

<Icydragon3D> 12Yeah.
<Neon> Infamous: Any specifics?
<InfamousZed> i dunno
<Majesty> 5its beed hot here too
<Lambda> I found it somewhat boring
<InfamousZed> i guess he expected an oblivion like game i think
<Spyrorocks`> I just bought tf2, portal, a bunch of half life 2 games, and day of defeat:source off ebay for $11
<Lambda> but the story was interesting
<Neon> They devoted the big six-page obsession thing on GameInformer for the sequel.
<Neon> So I figured it was good.
<Lambda> I saw that
<Lambda> Neon: Gamestop member too?
<Neon> For liiife.
<Neon> :P
<InfamousZed> i want to get border lands later
<Lambda> :P
<Icydragon3D> 12Well, it's cool inside.
<Neon> It was only five bucks with my purchase anyhow.
<Inokis> i just bought the coh expansion
<Quilava> hmnn..

<Spyrorocks`> I obly bought it for tf2 though
<Spyrorocks`> I dont like any of the other games
<Lambda> without realizing just how few used games I actually buy in a given year
<Neon> Lambda: It's a good deal, no?
<Neon> Oh.
<Icydragon3D> 12I live near the gulf.
<Lambda> it's good if you buy a lot of games from them
<InfamousZed> i'm expecting that thing to be quite awesome
<Stitch> Spyrorocks`, it doesn't work on my computer.
<Icydragon3D> 12Tampa...
<Majesty> 5cool. too bsd about oil spill huh??
<Neon> I actually don't buy lots of games anymore, but I always buy used unless there's a benefit.
<Lambda> the new metroid game looks pretty awesome based on the poster
<Lambda> Neon: same
<Majesty> 5i feel bad for animals and peeps that are involved in it
<Lambda> cheaper that way
<Icydragon3D> 12Yeah...
<Spyrorocks`> awwwwww
<Neon> I'm dying for Reach, but I just spent most of my fund for it at the movies. xD
<InfamousZed> well its being made by team ninja instead of nintendo so yeah its gona be metroid/ninja gaiden

<InfamousZed> and he needs to get reach as well so he can play with us
<Lambda> ixr re-added me as a friend on Live

<Lambda> Neon: not enough to buy any more of it
<Lambda> I enjoy it
<Neon> Haha, understandable.
<Majesty> 5sigh poor beaches and peeps and animals :(
<Lambda> but not enough to buy it
<Lambda> rent maybe though
<InfamousZed> well i like the beta enough to be convinced to buy the game
<Lambda> I rented the first two
<Neon> Reach is going to explode in popularity, I just know it. This is coming from someone who didn't even want to get Halo 3 because I used to hate the games.
<Icydragon3D> 12It didn't come where I live luckly... still sad...
<Lambda> bought the third because of the awesomely fun multiplayer
<Neon> ^ Exactly
<Neon> And Forge.
<Lambda> and now I just don't play multiplayer like I used to
<Neon> Forge kept me occupied forever.
<InfamousZed> i loved the new multiplayer gametype they added
<Majesty> 5thats good but yes it is sad.
<Neon> Network Test, with the gennies
<Neon> *?
<InfamousZed> lol i remember playing mario kart on halo

*Icydragon3D 12pokes Majesty and runs away.
<Neon> Medal of Honor is about to release something for the first time in years
<Lambda> lost interest in war shooters in general
<Lambda> Airborne was only a couple years ago
<Lambda> I think
<Neon> Ew, Airborne doesn't count.
<Neon> Nintendo made that, I think.
<Lambda> nah
<Lambda> EA did
<Lambda> I had it for the 360\
<Neon> Oh, okay.

<Icydragon3D> 12I'm sorry baby, what did you want me to see?

<Majesty> 5*cuddles*
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy|Sleeping> I hope there won't be any drilling involved
<Neon> 'Night.

*InfamousZed slaps RDX|Sleeping with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<RDX|Sleeping> I have one on Friday
<RDX|Sleeping> and their is drilling involved
<Lambda> D:

<RDX|Sleeping> have to get my wisdom teeth out soon too
<Icydragon3D> 12:3
<InfamousZed> i have mine in and i never had to get mine taken out
<Neon> Removing wisdom teeth is just the government's way of dumbing us down for their world domination.
<Majesty> 5howls lovingly song
<InfamousZed> why do you have to have them taken out anyway?
<Icydragon3D> 12^-^
<Lambda> I got mine out when I was 16
<Lambda> they told me that was very young
<Neon> It is.
<Lambda> that few have them out that early
<Neon> They're not even a problem or even developed usually until like 18.
<Ryft|SC2> woooow
<Ryft|SC2> I don't have to get mine out
<Ryft|SC2> :D
<Majesty> 5btw whats ur myspace link thing
<Icydragon3D> 12Hang on.
<Majesty> 5ok
<Icydragon3D> 12*kisses*
<Majesty> 5:)
<Majesty> 5blushes
<RDX|Sleeping> Navy requires them out
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> that makes sense
<InfamousZed> why does everyone want them out though
<Lambda> for me it was to relieve pain
<Lambda> they weren't growing right
<RDX|Sleeping> they only have a 10% chance of coming in right
<RDX|Sleeping> if they don't they will cause mouth infection and annoyance
<Lambda> yeah exactly
<Neon> At leats they aren't ripped out with pliers and like inserted into out ears like the Middle Ages.
<Lambda> so they have to be removed to prevent both
<Neon> *our
<Neon> *least
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Neon> Although there werne't pliers then.
<Neon> More like tongs.
<Lambda> The Middle Ages would've sucked so bad
<Icydragon3D> 12Uh I need to edit it first.
<Neon> Ha, ever watch an old SNL skit called Theodoric the Barber?
<Neon> Of York, lol.
<Majesty> 5ok :)
<Lambda> I've never watched SNL actually
<Neon> Ah. Well it's from the 70s, and it has Steve Martin and Bill Murray, haha.
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> wow
<Lambda> perfect comedy duo :o
<Neon> Random mention, haha.
<Neon> Eh, Steve Martin's not so great, I don't think.
<Lambda> really
<Lambda> I like him
<Lambda> especially in The Idiot
<Neon> Maybe because I haven't seen enough of his movies.
<Lambda> he isn't so great anymore
<Icydragon3D> 12Before I show you, just wanna let you know that I was joking, and I thought I was never gonna use it...
<Lambda> now he only does chick flicks and crap
<Neon> Right, and Cheaper By The Dozen. xD
<Lambda> but The Idiot was hilarious
<Majesty> 5ok
<Majesty> 5:)
<Neon> I've been meaning to see that.
<Lambda> I think that's what it was called
<Icydragon3D> 12http://www.myspace.com/463757201
<Lambda> is it The Idiot?
<Lambda> where he thinks he's black and he has a faithful dog and all that
<Icydragon3D> 12Plus Iied about mah age...
<Icydragon3D> 12>.<
<Neon> I think so.
<Neon> As for recent movies, I think he's good in the Pink Panther.
<Neon> But that's the only good one in like a decade or more.
<Lambda> haven't seen it actually
<Neon> Heh, he's the French inspector.
<Lambda> Oh wait
<Lambda> it's called The Jerk
<Lambda> not The Idiot
<Neon> Oh.
<Lambda> The Idiot is a Dostoyevsky book
<Neon> LOL I was thinking that.
<Majesty> 5LOL ITS FUNNY!!!! dies laughing
<Neon> In 2004's The Machinist Christian Bale is reading that.
<Lambda> woah cool
<Neon> That's a great movie, by the way.
<Neon> I loved it.
<Lambda> by the way
<Icydragon3D> 12Haha thanks... oh and be careful what you type... you know, little brother...
<Lambda> the poster for The Jerk says it all: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Jerk.jpg
<Majesty> 5ok
<Majesty> 5yeah
<Neon> Hohoho, '79.
<Neon> It hasn't loaded.
<Lambda> hmm
<Neon> Ah I remember this.
<Neon> They spoofed it with the black white supremist skit.

<Icydragon3D> 12<.<
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pqC563bX_w
<Neon> Oh, this'll be good.
<Lambda> the chorus goes "He said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what you want?!"
<Neon> It has the Rapper's Delight instrumentals.
<Neon> "Once in a lifetime, twice a day."
<Neon> XD
*Icydragon3D 12is happeh.

<Majesty> 7lol
<Majesty> 13pink! eww pink sucks
<Neon> WOT
<Lambda> Captain
<Neon> Wot you want?
<Neon> I sent it to him instead.
<Neon> Hm... what to do?
<Lambda> no idea
<Lambda> I am also bored
<Lambda> though I should sleep
<Neon> I said "Captain!"
<Lambda> I haven't gotten enough of it
<Lambda> wot
<Neon> Hm, I just caught up on sleep.
<Neon> I'm not tired yet, either.
<Lambda> I had bee caught up
<Lambda> until the last two nights
<Lambda> I hate being a semi insomniav
<Lambda> *insomniac
*Icydragon3D 12is super happeh.
<Neon> Mhm. Me too... :/
<Lambda> I'm so jealous of the people who are able to just lay down
<Lambda> and fall asleep
<Majesty> 13is super doper happeh
<Lambda> and stay asleep
<Lambda> everytime they try'
<Neon> I know.
<Neon> It's unfathomable.
<Neon> Even if I'm active the entire day I still will be unable to sleep.
<Lambda> speaking of insomnia
<Lambda> same here
<Lambda> I hate it
<Lambda> but yeah
<Lambda> I think InfamousZed fell asleep
<Neon> Ha, most likely.
<Lambda> our fellow insomniac
<Neon> Another thing; I'm jealous of those who fall asleep at their keyboards.
<Lambda> me too
<Neon> I could never fall asleep lke that without letting myself.
<Lambda> I have never done that
<Lambda> I have once
<Neon> How?
<Lambda> but it was when driving, not at a keyboard
<Lambda> by not sleeping for three days
<Lambda> >.>
<Neon> Hahahaha.
<Neon> Oooh.
<Lambda> other than that one time I cannot fall asleep without trying to
<Lambda> and half the time I still can't when I try to
<Neon> 'When I went six days without sleeping, I feel asleep during conversations with people.
<Neon> I'd be standing up talking and doze off for like 30 seconds.
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> wow
<InfamousZed> whats goin on?
<Neon> He lives!
<Lambda> were those six days by choice or was it just inability to sleep?
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> By choice.
<Lambda> out of curiosity
<Neon> To see if I could do it.
<Lambda> were you asleep?
<Lambda> wow
<Lambda> I would never do that to myself for more than a couple days
<InfamousZed> how long did you sleep when you finally did
<Lambda> and even then
<Neon> Infamous: I did it piecemeal
<Lambda> only for the sake if all nighters
<Neon> I'd sleep a few hours here, a few there.
<Neon> Yeah.
<Lambda> I'd see that it's already almost morning
*Icydragon3D 12almost dies of super happeh
<Lambda> "why bother trying"
<Neon> Right. Same here.
<InfamousZed> ive been up 50+ hours once but that was because i couldnt get to sleep because of pneumonia
<Neon> The past few weeks I've fallen asleep as the sun comes up. xD
<InfamousZed> i do the same thing all the time
<InfamousZed> course i work night shift and sleep when i come ome
<InfamousZed> *home
<LaptopAristeo> Hi Raine :)
*LaptopAristeo hugs Raine too
<Raine> hi
<Neon> Mhm.
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Lambda> yeah I used to too
<LaptopAristeo> How are you?
*Raine hugs
<Lambda> hated that so much
<Neon> I could easily handle 3rd shift.
<Raine> well enough, and you?
<Lambda> wouldn't have been so bad if the rest of the world also had that sleeping pattern
<Lambda> but at any time when I was awake
<Lambda> all my friends (and Stormy) were asleep
<Neon> Heh, there should be a community of people who all decide to reverse their clocks and see the long-term effects of being nocturnal.
<Lambda> haha
<InfamousZed> its called a bar
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> LOL
<InfamousZed> the english call it a pub
<Neon> I call it a prison.
<Lambda> heh
<InfamousZed> you ever been to a bar?
<Neon> Aye, sir
<Lambda> many times
<InfamousZed> i havent
<InfamousZed> "{
<Neon> Hehe, prison bars.
<InfamousZed> :P
<Lambda> around here bars are no different than reseraunts really
<Lambda> *restauraunts
<Neon> There are few places around here that are exclusively bars.
<LaptopAristeo> Okies
<Lambda> yeah true
<Ryft|SC2> QUICK
<Neon> It's all "Restaraunt and Pub."
<Ryft|SC2> TEST YOUR IQ
<Ryft|SC2> "A man builds a house with four rectagular walls, with each wall having a southern exposure. A bear comes along. What color is the bear? Brown, White, Pink, or Black?"
<Lambda> everything is "bar and grill" here
<Neon> White.
<Neon> It'd be a polar bear.
<Lambda> Pink
<Ryft|SC2> Very good Neon
<Ryft|SC2> My little bro said brown
<Neon> Heard it before.
<Ryft|SC2> xD
<Neon> Doesn't count.
<Ryft|SC2> Still is funny
<Neon> Yeah, fer shure.
*Icydragon3D 12pokes Majesty.
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> that's how it's pronounced with my accent
<Neon> I SAID CAPTAIN
<Neon> Really?
<Lambda> pretty much
<Neon> I adopt and [censored]ize so many accents I've forgotten which is my own.
<Lambda> the accent here is pretty much standard midwest accent
<Lambda> but with a bunch of shortcuts to saying some things
<Lambda> like "fer" instead of "for"
<Neon> Is "y'all" a staple?
<Lambda> nah
<Neon> YES
<Neon> I can tolerate you, then.
<Lambda> only people who want to be southerners say it
<InfamousZed> saywha
<Neon> People who want to be ghetto here says y'all.
<Lambda> I have never in my life used the word "y'all"
<Neon> *say
<Lambda> except maybe in impressions
<InfamousZed> i hear it every now and then but i dont really notice it right off the bat
<Majesty> 13:) i love you too
<Neon> My cousin goes to college in VA, so when I was there for a week I was berated with y'all and some weird word called "durst."
<Neon> It mean dare or something
<Icydragon3D> 12>.>
<Lambda> "durst"?
<Lambda> hmm
<Neon> .*means
<Lambda> weird
<Icydragon3D> 12:D
<Lambda> "I durst you"
<Majesty> 13im waiting for ms to load
<Icydragon3D> 12Ok...
<InfamousZed> youve been dursted
<Neon> Looked it up.
<Neon> It's an archaic past tense of dar.
<Neon> *dare
<Lambda> a few people around here have that Sarah Palin way of speaking
<Lambda> that gets a bit annoying honestly
<Neon> Haha, that's hilarious.
<Neon> At least you don't have Bush speakers.
<InfamousZed> kawaii
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> also
<Neon> "To get better alternatives energy, we are going to electrilize the energization industry."
<Lambda> Stormy makes fun of me for these ones
<Lambda> I say "beg" instead of "bag"
<Neon> Huh, that's odd.
<Lambda> and "dreygon" instead of
<Lambda> "dragon"
<Neon> So like a paper beg?
<Lambda> yeah
<InfamousZed> spyro the dreygon
<Neon> XD
<Neon> That's at least interesting and not ignorant sounding.
<Lambda> I pronounce the 'a' like an 'e'
<Lambda> I never noticed it until she pointed it out
<InfamousZed> there is no such thing as a short a in lambda's mouth
<InfamousZed> dam polish tounge
<Lambda> the weird thing is
<Lambda> she only lives 2 hours from me
<Lambda> maybe it is something to do with my polish upbringing
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> That's very strange.
<Neon> You'd probably think I talk weird, then.
<Lambda> also she lives in a city
<Lambda> or
<Lambda> near a city
<Lambda> I live in the rural area
<Neon> Mhm. That's a factor.
<Lambda> so that may account for the slightly different accent
<InfamousZed> i have the occational southern accent that come up on me every now and then
<InfamousZed> dont know why though
<Lambda> haha yeah I noticed that when we played Halo
<Lambda> it was barely noticable though
<Neon> You know Julia Roberts had a Georgia accent before she acted?
<Lambda> yeah
<InfamousZed> brb
<Neon> Had to have a speech trainer get rid of it.
*InfamousZed is now away - Reason : hiatus
<Lambda> they mention that in Ocean's Twelve
<Neon> Then later she needed it again and couldn't find it. xD
<Neon> Right.
<Lambda> when she played a girl who pretended to be herself
<Lambda> interesting twist if you ask me
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Mhm. Those are good movies.
<Lambda> they are
<Lambda> especially the first
<Neon> Ocean's Fourteen is coming, with DeNiro.
<Lambda> I haven't seen the original though
<Neon> D:
<Neon> Me either.
<Lambda> the one with Sinatra
<Lambda> DeNiro?
<Lambda> he has ruined his career
<Neon> MHm.
<Neon> Why, because of Meet the PArents?
<Neon> *Parents
<Lambda> I actually liked that movie
<Neon> Me too.
<Neon> A lot of peope disagree.
<Neon> *people
<Lambda> but no, just that he never playd his usual badass roles anymore
<Lambda> *plays
<Lambda> or not badass
<Lambda> but morally grey
<Neon> Mhm. I agree.
<Neon> Analyze This and the lot.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> and Taxi Driver
<Neon> Never saw it.
<Neon> I'm told that's child abuse.
<Neon> xD
<Lambda> Scorsese movies are always good if you want a character that you don't know how much you like
<Lambda> The Departed is amazing for exampe
<Neon> Right.
<Lambda> *example
<Neon> Scorcese latest, Shutter Island, was amazing.
<Lambda> I still need to see that one
<Lambda> honestly
<Neon> The Departed was alright. My friend is obsessed.
<Lambda> Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors
<Lambda> he always plays complicated roles
<Neon> He's good /now. /
<Neon> Titanic days, no.
<Lambda> yeah exactly
<Lambda> he was good from Gangs of New York (also Scorsese) on
<Neon> Did you like/see Inception yet?
<Lambda> neither
<Lambda> or
<Lambda> no to see
<Lambda> dunno to like
<Neon> You have to.
<Neon> It's mandatory.
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> maybe this weekend
<Lambda> sunday
<Neon> It was revolutionary, I think. But all Nolan filsm are.
<Lambda> saturday I have a family golf tournament
<Neon> *films
<Neon> Ahaha, nice.
<Lambda> What has he directed other than Dark Knight?
<Neon> Inception, Momento, etc.
<Neon> Momento was killer.
<Lambda> ah
<Neon> The Dark Knight, Batman Begins.
<Lambda> The only of his movies I've seen was Dark Knight
<Lambda> I have only seen parts of Batman Begins
<Neon> I like Batman Begins. For an origins movie it was pretty good standalone.
<Neon> But yeah, I think he's a must-see from now on.
<Lambda> what are your stands on the spiderman movies?
<Lambda> I like the first two
<Neon> I like the first two, then it went downhill. 3 was okay.
<Lambda> same
<Lambda> X-Men?
<Neon> Raimi left, so we have a reboot now. D:
<Lambda> Fist two great
<Lambda> from then on
<Lambda> sucked
<Neon> X-Men? They were perfect, IMO.
<Lambda> the first two I agree
<Neon> I liked all three, but Origins was weird.
<Lambda> but the third and Origins
<Lambda> Origins was way too over the top
<Lambda> I liked how Gambit was in it
<Neon> ^ Yeah.
<Neon> X-Men is my favorite superhero series.
<Lambda> Spiderman is mine
<Neon> It's what got me into sci-fi and comic books stuff.
<Lambda> but I do like the first couple X-Men
<Neon> Well, as for heroes with powers, I think the X-Men contend with Spider-Man. Without powers, Batman is the best hero.
<Lambda> I had an embarassing story involving X-Men that Stormy likes to pick on me for
<Ryft|SC2> QUICK
<Ryft|SC2> I need good anime
<Neon> Hahaha, tell me.
<Ryft|SC2> BOMBARD ME
<Ryft|SC2> >:C
<Lambda> well
<Neon> I know nothing of anime, sorry.
<Lambda> I dunno
<Lambda> same here
<Ryft|SC2> [censored]
<Lambda> the only anime I watch is Pokemon
<Lambda> xP
<Neon> I'll come back to you when I'm Japanese.
<Lambda> and yes I do still sometimes watch it
<InfamousZed> i like full metal alchemist and bleach..
*InfamousZed is no longer away : Gone for 10 minutes 55 seconds
<Lambda> but very very rarely
<Neon> Hey, ever notice that in our generation everyone who is moderately intelligent seems to like anime and manga?
<Neon> I'm talking like 80%.
<Lambda> except me
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> ah
<Neon> Me either.
<Neon> We must be dumb.
<Lambda> must be
<InfamousZed> cause theres nothing animated thats wortha crap anymore
<Lambda> you know what>
<Lambda> Are we hipsters?
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Like, I join writing sites, and EVERYONE there can write and have a good conversation, and they all love anime.
<Lambda> sometimes we kinda act like it
<InfamousZed> i remember batman when i was a kid.. where did that go
<Neon> Lambda: Eh, maybe.
<Neon> I was raised in counterculture.
<InfamousZed> LIBERAL!
<Neon> I'm con, actually. xD
<Lambda> my little group of friends pretty much defined counterculture
<InfamousZed> Ill have rdx quash you
<Lambda> we would get annoyed at anything that was "overrated"
<Neon> My best friend is obsessed with anything bohemian or avant-garde.
<Lambda> what is bohemian?
<Lambda> I've heard that word before
<InfamousZed> whats avant
<Lambda> but never knew what it meant
<Neon> Yeah, exactly. He's very protective of his little-known music, and would be [censored]ed if anyone else started lstening to it.
<InfamousZed> ive heard of bohemian rhapsody
<Neon> Lambda: In Bohemian Rhapsody?
<Lambda> ah yeah
<Lambda> mhm
<Lambda> xP
<Neon> It's another subterm for counterculture.
<Lambda> so kinda like Aicebo in a way?
<Neon> I guess so.
<Lambda> she i9sn't so hab though
<Lambda> *isn't
<Lambda> (bad
<Lambda> *bad
<Neon> No, no.
*Lambda cannot type in the dark
<Neon> I think hipsters are kind of like snobs today, so I'd rather not identify myself with them.
<Lambda> yeah
<Neon> Plus I care little about fashion like they do.
<Lambda> very true
<Neon> I'll stick with bohemian... eccentric, even. xd
<Lambda> I don't know what I'd call myself
<Lambda> just nerd works
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> my mom thinks "nerd" means the same as "jerk"
<InfamousZed> i dont know what you guys are talkin about :P
<Neon> Lambda; HHaha, what?
<InfamousZed> your mom is a nazi
<Neon> " Bohemians, in this colloquial use of the word, were associated with unorthodox or anti-establishment political or social viewpoints, which were often expressed through free love, frugality, and/or voluntary poverty."
<Lambda> she sees a really rude person and angrily says "what a nerd"
<Lambda> I reply
<Lambda> "Mom, /I/ am a nerd"
<Neon> :P
<Icydragon3D> 12Rawr.
<InfamousZed> lol
<InfamousZed> should be dork or something
<Neon> Actually, screw bohemian.
<InfamousZed> i hear girls call a jerk or ahole a dork and it sorta lands flat when i hear it
<Lambda> yeah
<Neon> Avant-garde suits me better, seeing as I'm not liberal.
<Lambda> haha
<InfamousZed> whats avant
<Neon> You like to experminent and push the envelope socially.
<Lambda> ah
<Neon> You're a trendsetter, and such.
<InfamousZed> progressive then i guess
<Neon> *experiment
<Icydragon3D> 12Majesty?
<Neon> You also may or may not have ties to postmodern thought. >_>
<Lambda> what are your views on postmodern thought?
<Majesty> 13grr ,yspcae is being stupid
<Majesty> 13im here
<Neon> Hm...
<Icydragon3D> 12Mkay.
<Neon> Can't say I like it's headliners, but...
<Neon> It has some truth, I think.
<Lambda> yeah
<Neon> How about you?
<Majesty> 13:)
<Lambda> it's something that I really don't know how I feel about
<Lambda> like
<Majesty> 13what did u say on my space i couldt i\open the thing
<Lambda> I don't want to look at things from a postmodern viewpoint
<Icydragon3D> 12Open what?
<Lambda> but at the same time
<Majesty> 13the chat
<Lambda> a lot of it does actually make sense
<Neon> I think a person's views on it should change as what was once modern becomes post. xD
<Lambda> XD
<InfamousZed> what are you guys talking about anyway?
<Lambda> isn't the basic idea of postmodernism that the ideas of right and wrong are irrelevant or something
<Neon> "I adore philoooosophyyyyy."
<Neon> That was such a great vid.
<InfamousZed> oh philosophy
<Icydragon3D> 12Click online friends then click meh.
<Neon> Lambda: It's like a pragmatic view on the course humanity should take to become better.
<Lambda> so like "if it works do it"
<Lambda> and that's all that matters
<Lambda> or am I wrong still?
<Neon> Yeah, and what should be done and when it should be done. Some extreme forms are for a very regulating scoiety.
<Neon> *society
<Neon> Youve basically got it.
<Neon> I don't know much to be honest.
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> I really don't care for that way of thinking really
<Lambda> I like to believe that there is always hope for positive improvement
<Lambda> there's always another way so to speak
<Neon> Me either. I think the ends don't always justify the means, and that humanity will progress without us needing to hatch a master plan.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> and as long as we constantly strive to do what we feel is right, that is all we can do to advance society
<Lambda> no need to take it too far and do "whatever works"
<Neon> The way I see it is, if we can't progress without killing ourselves, what is worth preserving?
<Lambda> Yeah
<Neon> I mean, doesn't a person know what do to survive?
<Lambda> that's a very good point
<Neon> Thanks.
<Lambda> no problem
<Neon> Infamous, any thoughts?
<InfamousZed> hm?
<InfamousZed> bout what
*Neon gestures to the board.
<Icydragon3D> 12Majesty?
<Neon> You know, ur future.
<Neon> *our
<InfamousZed> oh i dunno...
<Lambda> the future of society
<Neon> We should kill all the minorities. Then the presidents. Then the actors.
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> After that, Coca Cola will be our new water supply.
<Neon> THE STORM IS COMIN'
<Lambda> haha
<InfamousZed> either we'll come to a time whether we will fall back to the way we were and rise back up like the last civilizations before us or we will become advanced to the point where we will actually touch our goals and not have anything else to go to
<Neon> I worry that we're too advanced already.
<InfamousZed> think of it as this...
<Neon> As in, the last thing we need is more inventive ways to kill each other.
<Lambda> I agree completely
<InfamousZed> there are 5 things that people strive for as they live... in this order...
<Neon> Haha, in ll the stories about aliens and stuff, they smother us early on because we advance to fast and are like babies playing with nukes.
<Neon> *all
<Neon> *too
<Neon> There's some truth to that.
<Lambda> yeah there is
<InfamousZed> security, nesessity, relationship, personal goals, personal desires
<Neon> Are goals that different from desires?
<Lambda> Infamous: now would you put the first in the list as the most important or vice versa?
<InfamousZed> people will set their bar at one point of this pyramid or annother
<InfamousZed> in that order
<InfamousZed> goals are different as they are long term
<InfamousZed> desires being shorter term
<Neon> Oh, good point.
<Lambda> desires can be achieved more easily basically
<InfamousZed> job vs cash handout
<Lambda> whereas goals you continue to strive for
<Neon> Can we all agree that people are way too selfish for their own good?
<Lambda> people in general?
<Neon> Yeah.
<Lambda> in general yeah
<InfamousZed> its what people will do to acheive those things to get those 2 last steps to their happiness
<Lambda> but I don't feel all people are too selfish
<InfamousZed> people tend to be selfish but thats part of this type of society
<Neon> No, not all. There are a /ton/ of factors that ome into to whether ot not they are on their way to altruism or heading the other way,
<Neon> *come, or
<InfamousZed> people are raised with the notion that you can have this and make this, not that this society is a system that you are a part of and has to work in tandom with annother to make it work well
<Neon> Enviroment, personality, parenting, societal pressures, and all of that shape you more than you'd think.
<Neon> Infamous: Yeah, right.
<Lambda> yeah I agree
<Neon> No sarcasm.
<InfamousZed> thats the environment part of the equation
<Neon> *environment
<InfamousZed> there is also a personal part that'll take place
<Neon> Heh, now who thinks some are conceived as what we'd call "evil"?
<InfamousZed> you can choose a path ,so to speak, that can and will alter you in the way you think at one point or annother
*Neon nods.
<InfamousZed> evil is relative
<Lambda> I don't believe that
<Neon> Me either.
<Lambda> that people are concieved evil
<Neon> But yeah, that's why I quoted it, Infamous.
<Neon> From an amoral standpoint, it's be moot.
<Neon> *it'd
<InfamousZed> only in extreme cases is an act considered truly evil
<InfamousZed> anyone can agree that ending a life for no apperent reason is bad
<Neon> Not everyone.
<Neon> That's where the subjectiveness comes in.
<Lambda> but few can agree on whether ending it /for/ a reason is bad
<InfamousZed> well.. ok now that i think about it yeah...
<Neon> Some would consider it their right to be able to kill anyone they pleased.
<InfamousZed> but to they have sane autonomy
<Neon> Maybe. Could just have a terrible ego and no respect for human life.
<InfamousZed> of which has concious empathy and reasonable intellegence
<Lambda> but where does this lack of respect come from
<Lambda> that's what I wonder
<Neon> Having their own life treated as worthless.
*Neon shrugs.
<InfamousZed> there are those with anti-social personality disorders
<InfamousZed> who do not see past their own eyes
<Neon> Mhm. Megalomania.
<Lambda> I actually read an article a few days back about social intellignece
<Lambda> *intelligence
<InfamousZed> they think for themselves, breath for themselves and judge for themselves
*LaptopAristeo wonders what mental/personality disorders Aristeo has :o
<Neon> Infamous: Right.
<InfamousZed> you have a hotpocket disorder
<Neon> Lambda: summary?
<Lambda> basically
<InfamousZed> megalomania?
<InfamousZed> thought that was a delusion of grandeur or something
*LaptopAristeo googles megalomania
<Neon> Yes, like all the crazy villains on TV. xD
<Lambda> nah, I was just starting my summary with the word "basically"
<Lambda> :P
<LaptopAristeo> InfamousZed: What if it's not an illusion? :o
<Neon> Emperor Zurg in Buzz Lightyear
<Lambda> so ayway this'll take me a sec to type
<InfamousZed> delusion not illusion
<LaptopAristeo> Or that
<Neon> Meg. is like desire for everything to be under their control, subverted to their opinions, and everything grandiose.
<Neon> No opposition.
<InfamousZed> if you didnt have the delusion of granduer then youd be God himself basically
<InfamousZed> antisocial is different
<Neon> Mhm.
<InfamousZed> anti social is surviveing as one instead of as in a group with a bit of rage thrown in
<Lambda> basically everybody has a social intelligence, which is the ability to understand how to treat social situations, and how to view other people, basically a scale of empathy vs. a complete lack of understanding of other people
<InfamousZed> although with personality disorders there is a high chance of having multiple disorders
<Lambda> and this social intelligence can cause very sever personality disorders
<Neon> Lambda: This is theory? Sounds pretty accepted to me.
<Lambda> well it is pretty well accepted
<Lambda> I just found it interesting
<InfamousZed> wait...
<LaptopAristeo> Most people with cults have narcisstic personality disorder
<Neon> Have the artcile perchance?
<Neon> *article
<InfamousZed> no....
<Lambda> I'd have to find it
<LaptopAristeo> I mean, who make cults
<Neon> Don't bother with it. Aristeo: Depends on the cut, really.
<InfamousZed> people with cults probably have delusions, dementia or what not or a megalomatic desire
<Neon> *cult
<InfamousZed> narcissistic personality disorder is not really bad as it is annoying
<InfamousZed> its like kjakings
*LaptopAristeo doesn't know of a cult where the leader wasn't showing serious signs of NPD
<InfamousZed> which is why he [censored]es me off
<LaptopAristeo> And megalomania and stuff
<Neon> I mean, there are cult heads who don't allow the members to have any physical contact at all, yet he or she can sexually abuse anyone within that they want. They hinge on a very loose sense of standards.
<InfamousZed> if hes narsesistic then he would have people worship him directly or indirectly so i see where your getting at aristeo
<LaptopAristeo> You kinda have to in order to be a good cult leader
<Andres> Hai :o
<LaptopAristeo> Neon: You talking about those wolf pack things in high schools?
<Lambda> Neon: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article640746.ece
<Neon> No, not really.
<Neon> Kjakings isn't a narc, haha.
<InfamousZed> he sorta makes me think he is cause most things he talks about tend to revolve around himself
<Neon> Thanks, dude.
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<Lambda> no problem
<Neon> Lol, I remember when I first encountered what they call "emotional intelligence."
<Neon> I thought it was BS. Not sure now.
<Lambda> I always just pivtured Kja as a whimpy little kid who acts tough on the internet
<Lambda> I don't think it's BS at all
<Neon> I did some digging like the creep I am, and saw evidence of him being an annoying tagalong.
<InfamousZed> i thought emotional intelligence was empathy
<Neon> Not tought at all.
<Lambda> some people don't handle emotional situations as well as others
<Neon> *tough
<Raine> hi
<Neon> Empathy is pretty broad. I mean, we're not even sure how it works.
<Neon> Ever see Pwoder?
<Neon> *Powder
<InfamousZed> to immagin in the eyes of the other?
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<InfamousZed> isnt that what empathy is?
<LaptopAristeo> :)
<Neon> Well, further, even. To actually experience another's emotions.
<Lambda> yeah
<InfamousZed> ah
<LaptopAristeo> The brain sure is complicated :x
<Lambda> anyone can put themselves in another's shoes
<Neon> That's why I use Pwoder as an example, since he had that ability.
<Neon> *Pwoder
<Neon> *POWDER
<InfamousZed> never heard of powder
<Neon> XD
<Lambda> but few can actually try to share the emotions
*Neon nods.
<LaptopAristeo> Share the emotions/
<LaptopAristeo> ?*
<InfamousZed> ever watch king of the hill
<Neon> Aristeo: It sure is. Irony is we have to coax our brains to let us figure out how they work.
<Lambda> LaptopAristeo: share meaning understand completely where they're coming from and feel a situation in the same way they do
<InfamousZed> you see quite a few personality flaws within the characters in that show
<Neon> I've seen KotH.
<Lambda> not just understand
<Neon> Funny show.
<Lambda> but also feel
<LaptopAristeo> Lambda: Oh, no one can do that :o
<Lambda> sure they can
<LaptopAristeo> Sometimes some people can do that in some situations
<LaptopAristeo> Never heard of anyone that can do that with everyone even most of the time
<Lambda> well no
<Lambda> but some people are more prone to show it at all than others
<Neon> I thinkwe can be empathetic to the best of our ability, but in order to actual feel their emotions we would have to literally be them.
<Neon> Because all the little nuances would have to be exactly the same for us to feel exactly how another does.
<Lambda> true
<LaptopAristeo> No one can relate to anyone completely
<InfamousZed> women tend to work at empathy much better than men
<Lambda> so basically it's impossible to be truly empathetic is what we're saying?
<Neon> Yes.
<Lambda> just to do the best we can
<Neon> But what we can do is usually enough,.
<Neon> Funny, that Twilight Zone explored this a lot.
<Neon> *Zone book
<LaptopAristeo> In the field of management, though, you really need to be able to figure out why the people who work for you are motivated to do what they're doing
<LaptopAristeo> Don Corelone had a pretty good quote on that in The Godfather II
<Lambda> Ooh
<Lambda> The Godfather
<Neon> :P I think I know.
<Lambda> great films
<LaptopAristeo> They're okay
*LaptopAristeo watched them once and liked them
<Neon> I've only watched the first.
*Lambda has the boxed set of the trilogy
*LaptopAristeo has strange tastes in movies though
<InfamousZed> "this is just a big shti sandwhich.... and we all gotta takea bite"
<Neon> :P
<LaptopAristeo> But yeah, Lambda, you prolly know what I'm talking about them
<LaptopAristeo> then*
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> understanding motivation is a huge part of empathy
<InfamousZed> oi.... you guys and your philosophy have finally woke me up and made me hungry...
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> it's made me want to stay awake
<Lambda> and keep talking about it
<Neon> :P
<Lambda> ]though I really need sleep
<Neon> :P
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> :P
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> Alrighty.
<InfamousZed> :D
<LaptopAristeo> And figuring out that motivation will make your job easier
<LaptopAristeo> Like, you'll know what approaches to take
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> It's like when actors get in character once they undertsand the motives.
<Neon> *understand
<LaptopAristeo> yepyep
<LaptopAristeo> Lean on Me was a pretty good movie
<LaptopAristeo> And I was thinking about that thing about understanding motives throughout the movie
<Neon> What's its premise?
<LaptopAristeo> Inner city school that's about to be taken over by the state, and a principle has a year to get it and its students into shape
<LaptopAristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8GcPWyE2k here's a clip
<EpicStatsGuy> inb4 fail
<Neon> Why is it being taken over? Bad management?
<Neon> Hehe, Freeman.
<LaptopAristeo> It was just statistically the worst school in the state
<InfamousZed> gotta have a road built on it
<Lambda> Hey, that's me
<Neon> ^ Lol.
<Lambda> according to Kja at least
<Armageddon> 02hm
<Armageddon> 02everything went down
<Armageddon> 02wonderful
<Neon> LaptopAristeo: I like this already.
*Armageddon is away: afk
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<LaptopAristeo> Watch the movie
<Neon> I'm gonna.
<Neon> Morgan's character reminds me of my dad. xD
<Neon> Not his rage, but his method.
<LaptopAristeo> That style usually doesn't work unless you're dealing with people who have to deal with you
<Neon> LOL at the end of the vid.
<Neon> Yeah, I know.
*LaptopAristeo couldn't run student government meetings like that >.>
<Lambda> well hey I think I'm going to go to bed
<LaptopAristeo> nini :)
*LaptopAristeo tucks Lambda into bed
<Lambda> felt good to talk about philosophy
<Neon> Okay, night.
<Lambda> and stuff
<Lambda> night
<Neon> Haha, yup.
<InfamousZed> ah what
<InfamousZed> crap
<Neon> I should sleep too.
<InfamousZed> yeah maybe me to
<InfamousZed> cya
<Neon> Bye.
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<LaptopAristeo> Armageddon! :o

<Stitch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCtBkDebK-s&feature=related
<Inokis> not fun
<Inokis> not ur face i hope
<LoopyDood> It was on my hand
<LoopyDood> Very small area, not much pain
<LoopyDood> But... it was visibly cooked
<Inokis> i was in the car with a friend of mine in hs when the car flipped and my hand went through the sun roof
<Inokis> yeah pain of any kind isn't fun
<Inokis> and hands are necessary
<LoopyDood> So what happened to your hand?
<Andres> BAIBAI
<Inokis> lacerated in 3 places, nearly severing the tendon in my middle finger, exposing the nerves. was in a cast for a month to keep the tendon from snapping
<LoopyDood> Wow
<LoopyDood> I don't think I've ever done something that painful to myself
<LoopyDood> http://www.youtube.com/user/mysteryguitarman?blend=1&ob=4#p/c/CF81022FAB19616C/52/exHoV2st-3k

<Rain> chris
<LoopyDood> Anyways, I found this: http://www.gossipgamers.com/amazing-warhammer-40-000-dreadnought-pc-case-mod/
<Smooth-Scorch> 4going to it now
<Curly> hi Ari ^^
<Deathbat> Good o!
<Aristeo> I think everyone needs to have a lesbian girlfriend at least once
<Aristeo> Especially lesbians, but I mean, other people too
<Inokis> not my thing
<Aristeo> I mean, just for the life experience
<Inokis> i dunno i think id get jealous of the fact they liked girls more than me
<Aristeo> Heh, that reminds me of a Jerry Springer episode
<Rain> lol
*Rain always wanted to date one specific girl
<Rain> but she got engaged
<Inokis> i quit watching jerry the noise and the yelling is annoying
<Rain> > .>
<Aristeo> A guy was cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, but his girlfriend was also cheating on him with that same girl
<Inokis> yep typical jerry
<Aristeo> And everyone married each other and lived happily ever after
<Inokis> or the guy that wasn't gay but kept banging his cell mate after he got out of prison and it was ruining his marriage
<Rain> lolol
<Aristeo> If I went to prison, I don't think I would look up any of my prison friends on the outside
<Inokis> what prison friends..
<Aristeo> The dudes you roll with
<Inokis> one of the rules in prison is you don't have friends you have protection but no ones a friend
<Inokis> everyone will kill you if they have to
<Aristeo> :o
<Aristeo> Sounds like someone's been to prison :o
<Inokis> nope
<Inokis> trust me if i went to prison i wouldn't walk out alive
<Aristeo> xD
<Aristeo> I think Grimm has been to county jail for that Mary Jane -- I guess his police officer friend arrested him for not sharing or something, I dunno
<Inokis> yet one more reason to avoid it altogether
<Rain> lol aristeo
<Rain> it wasn't cus of that
<Aristeo> I dun remember
<Rain> he got into a fight at a bar and hospitalized some guy that drank his beer
<Rain> he got sent to jail for a while
<Rain> and then was on probation I think
<Rain> I still love him though
<Rain> he's adorable
<Aristeo> xD
<Aristeo> yes'm
<Rain> oh shit
<Rain> I haven't texted him in almost 3 days
<Aristeo> RAIN
<Aristeo> BAD RAIN
<Rain> he probably thinks i died or something
<Rain> oh crap
<Rain> I cursed
<Curly> rawr
*Rain sighs
<Curly> my computer froze on me, twice >_>
<Aristeo> Curly: Did it freeze because it overheated? :o
<Curly> I'm not sure
<Curly> I think it might have
<Curly> I might need another fan
<Curly> the cpu and gpu were fine, but there's one heatsink that's really hot
<Curly> and I'm not sure what it is
<Curly> maybe one of the bridges
<Curly> either way, my computer froze and then froze again when I rebooted :S
<Inokis> i had that going on all day yesterday
<Rain> Aristeo: oh science*
<Inokis> it seems fixed for the moment
<Rain> am I forgiven?
<Curly> oh god!
<Curly> :3
<Rain> lol
<Aristeo> okies :3
<Rain> yay
<Curly> Inokis: maybe your computer's overheating too? :O
<Curly> I'm still wondering if I can put my computer in a fish tank >.>
<Inokis> well the fans were as old as the case 6 or 8 years so i replaced them and put an additional one in
<Inokis> it seems to be working
<Inokis> so im hoping it stays stable
<Inokis> no issues since i replaced them
<Curly> get a temperature monitoring program
<Curly> like speedfan or something
<Inokis> i have the case temp
<Inokis> its running a tad hot
<Inokis> but stable
<Curly> the case temp or the cpu temp? because if the case temp is hot, then the cpu temp must be horrible :X
<Stitch> I actually heard of a computer that used complete submersing as a cooling system.
<Stitch> I don't know how, but they did.
<Curly> Stitch: just get a fish tank and fill it with mineral oil :O
<Curly> although, some mobos might not be able to handle that
<Curly> I read that there are parts that might break down after a few days on some mother boards
<Inokis> kk i installed the mainboard tools for monitoring brb have to reboot

<mitten> living in your happy little world of butterflies
<Aristeo> :3
<mitten> aside from your island of liberalism
<Tripp> win!!!
<Tripp> Icydragon made a win
<Icydragon> 12I finally got what Deathbat was talking about...
<Icydragon> 12>.>
<Aristeo> I'm moderate I, strong N, very strong T, and moderate J :3
<Kristen> peeps chill out
<Kristen> or i wills break ur faces and snap ur necks. lol
<Icydragon> 12She fell in love once, but she broke it. lol
<mitten> it'll balance out as you age
<mitten> silly
<Aristeo> I develop my E and my S though :3
<Aristeo> I don't really have a well-developed F, but I use my N as a replacement for my lack of F
*Icydragon 12tackels Kristen
<Kristen> tackles all peeps
<mitten> you have an abundance of Fi
<Tripp> dang
<Tripp> i've been raped
<mitten> your Fe is like mine
<Icydragon> 12O.O
<mitten> well
<Aristeo> I'm not sure what that is
<Tripp> jk
<mitten> when mines small
<mitten> Fe is like thinking about everyone
<Aristeo> Talk in MBTI terms
<mitten> Fi is like inside
<Aristeo> Talk in MBTI terms
<Curly> extraverted feeling, introverted feeling
*Aristeo is not going to learn another system :|
*Curly is reading the wikipedia article on socionics
<Tripp> i on ravage rider
<mitten> lol
<Tripp> yay, not
<Aristeo> I'm not learning socionics
<Aristeo> MBTI is sufficient
<Kristen> RAPIST ON DA LOOSE
<Curly> all I know is I'm an ISTP >.>
<Kristen> jk
*mitten doesn't want to, but might if she can find someone on personalitycafe who knows about it
<Tripp> ugh ravage rider
*Icydragon 12is in love.
<Tripp> aww
<Aristeo> I have feelings, but I don't really use them. I'm kind of like a Vulcan in that regard
<Tripp> with who?
<Icydragon> 12>.>
<Icydragon> 12Umm...
<Tripp> oh kristen
<Tripp> my bad
<Icydragon> 12No..
<Inokis> i don't give affection to ppl i don't care about but when i do im an open book to them and am very intense
<Icydragon> 12<.<
<Curly> and socionics is really complicated looking at this article >_>
<Tripp> me?
<Icydragon> 12NOOOOOOO........
*Curly gives up on reading it
<Tripp> lol i give up
<Tripp> idk who
<Aristeo> Yeah, MBTI is enough for me
<Icydragon> 12What?
<mitten> lol
<Curly> apparently socionics isn't widely supported as a scientific theory
<Tripp> idk
<Tripp> who u love
<Icydragon> 12Kristen?
<mitten> yeah
<Icydragon> 12You there?
<Tripp> i said that and u said no
<Tripp> oi
<mitten> its like trying to follow something strictly
<Aristeo> Socionics is pseudo-science
<mitten> and then are given maslows
<mitten> heirachy
<Kristen> yeah
<mitten> hierarchy
<mitten> *
<Tripp> poor cynder captured by pirates
<Kristen> im here
<Aristeo> Socionics for me has about as much credibility as string theory
<Curly> well, it looks like socionics could have some potentional but nobody's bothered to standardize it
<Tripp> and now she's captured by gaul
<Tripp> yipee <.<
<Icydragon> 12:)
<Curly> not that I even really understand what I'm reading >_>
<Inokis> why don't you think string theory is credible it explains a lot if they could only observe it
<Curly> I don't think string theory is credible either
<Curly> because for string theory to exist you have to assume the laws of physics are flexible
*Icydragon 12jumps on Kristen.
<Tripp> kristen i stopped after the executioner
<Inokis> yes
<Curly> which I don't think they are
<Aristeo> Just because something sounds complex and uses a lot of technical terms doesn't mean it has any credibility
<Curly> just that scientists haven't been able to pin it down enough for it to be unrandomized
<Curly> randomness is only lack of understanding
<Inokis> physics may not be the same in every universe so they have to be flexible somewhat
<Aristeo> I don't care for any of this "Wouldn't it be cool if ...." kind of science, because it's not science
<Curly> universes are seperate from each other
<Inokis> yes
<Curly> so one system of physics has nothing to do with another
<Curly> that doesn't make physics flexible within one universe
<Aristeo> String theory is "wouldn't it be cool if" pseudo-science
<Inokis> but if phisics wasn't flixeible it would be the same in every universe
<Kristen> im here
<Curly> string theory isn't about seperate universes but connected alternate universes
<Kristen> ok
<Tripp> did u hear me?
<Inokis> yes
<Curly> physics is not one thing
<Curly> one universe has one physics system while another universe has another
<Inokis> ok
<Inokis> but as a system
<Inokis> if it was inflexible
<Curly> you can't talk about physics as a whole when you're talking about seperate universes
<Inokis> it would be a constant wherever
<Kristen> yeah
<Tripp> ok
<Curly> that's like saying the laws of the road are flexible because in Canada it's one thing but in the States it's another
<Tripp> well i'm off, talk to u ppls later
<Kristen> k
<Kristen> byr
<Inokis> that just means law is flexible
<Curly> ...
<Icydragon> 12:L
<Curly> nevermind >.>
<Kristen> im here icy
<Kristen> ok
<Icydragon> 12^-^
<Kristen> <3
<Aristeo> Actually, my biggest issue is with M-theory, which is a suppliment of string theory
<Kristen> brb
<Aristeo> The whole 11-dimensions thing
<Curly> I thought the 11 dimensions thing was a geometric theory
<Curly> or is that something else
<Aristeo> Basically, it's not science if the theory starts out as "wouldn't it be cool if"
<Aristeo> That's not science :(
<Aristeo> You need evidence and testability and scientific method and all that good stuff
<Aristeo> Or it's not science, it's religion
<Kristen> back

<Lambda> I haven't been on since he added me
<InfamousZed> as icy puts it... ixr has emo writen all over his face
<Icydragon> 12Yaaay!
<Lambda> haha, he sort of does
<Lambda> but at the same time it seems like he does it as a joke
<Kristen> 10u still on myspace
<InfamousZed> wish he would be more casual about it though and not try to be a hard ass
<Icydragon> 12Yeah.
<Kristen> 10ok
<Lambda> yeah, ixr is different than he used to be
<InfamousZed> yeah but it was like over night when he changed though...
<Lambda> yeah it was
<InfamousZed> i was like wtf is wrong bud
<Lambda> all of a sudden he was acting like a jerk
<Lambda> now he's a funny jerk
<InfamousZed> cause he started going off on me
<Lambda> but still not like he used to be either
<InfamousZed> chances are is that he found a clich in school that is fitting in with
<Lambda> I'm actually wondering if it's more the opposite
<Lambda> like he's all [censored]ed about everyone at his school or something
<Lambda> but then again
<InfamousZed> he seems to rigid to and less passive to not be with some sort of group in my opinion
<Lambda> yeah true
<Lambda> when we first met him he was more like an outcast
<Lambda> he was more carefree, but at the same time a little lonely almost
<InfamousZed> got on xbox live so i could play with him but he hasnt showed up
<Lambda> were you there the night when that tornado was at his house and he was all worried?
<Lambda> it was around then when he changed
<Lambda> I haven't been on xbox live in forever
<InfamousZed> i think
<InfamousZed> i remember him saying stuff about a tornado or storm or something
<Lambda> yeah he was freaking out and he wouldn't say why
<Lambda> and eventually he said a tornado was coming his way and signed out
<Lambda> have you ever noticed how he never talks about his irl life?
<InfamousZed> yeah
<Lambda> he's talked about how he feels about his family once to me
<InfamousZed> hmm
<InfamousZed> i dont remember that
<Lambda> it was just me and him
<Lambda> I remember that
<Lambda> you might have been there
<InfamousZed> what did he say
<Lambda> but if you were you were asleep or something
<Lambda> he said that he's from one of those huge religious families and he can't stand his parents for it
<InfamousZed> hmm
<Lambda> because he isn't religious at all
<InfamousZed> hmm
<Lambda> like he said he feels like the outcast in the family
<Lambda> like he can't relate to any of the others

<Aicebo> stormy goes to bed way too early
<Lambda> way too early?
<InfamousZed> yeah... she should at least start around 2 or 3

<InfamousZed> if its on a monday
<Lambda> plus if I stay up too late it's like my body doesn't want to fall asleep

<InfamousZed> around this time everynight is when i want to go to sleep
*Aicebo loves not having a job, if she had one she'd want a nighttime one

<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> I wonder if that movie will still be in theaers in a week and a half
<Lambda> *theaters
<Aicebo> probably
<Lambda> w00t
*Lambda schedules to take Stormy to it
*LaptopAristeo discovered chocolate covered bacon

<Lambda> :)
*LaptopAristeo tucks Stormy|Sleeping into bed
<Aicebo> GOD why does everyone assume that younger people like chocolate
<Aicebo> :(
<Lambda> but bacon
<InfamousZed> i like chocolate
<Lambda> I like chocolate a lot
<Lambda> and bacon even more
<Lambda> mixed?
<Lambda> hmmm
<LaptopAristeo> I never tried it
<LaptopAristeo> I just discovered it
<Lambda> I'll just have to find out
<Lambda> ah
<LaptopAristeo> I assume that everyone likes bacon and chocolate
<LaptopAristeo> Not just younger people
<LaptopAristeo> Everyone
<Aicebo> :(
<LaptopAristeo> Everyone likes bacon / chocolate unless stated otherwise
<LaptopAristeo> :3
*LaptopAristeo turns Aicebo's frown upside down
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<LaptopAristeo> :D?
<Aicebo> :(
<LaptopAristeo> noooooooo

*Aicebo only has two hours tonight to not be bummed out but isn't counting on it
<LaptopAristeo> hmmm
<LaptopAristeo> Watch stand up comedy
<LaptopAristeo> That helps me whenever I feel depressed
<Lambda> lol
<Aicebo> nah
<Lambda> well
*Aicebo is enjoying this 90s emo mix so far so that helps a little
<Lambda> just listen to happy music
<Lambda> ...or emo music
<Lambda> :P
<Aicebo> :P
<Lambda> whatever works
<Lambda> anywho
<LaptopAristeo> Or talk to hot guys that you're interested in
<Lambda> *girls
<LaptopAristeo> Or girls, I dunno
*Lambda is almost falling asleep
<Aicebo> I haven't had time to look for new music lately I was too busy being bored and guiltily watching soap oepras to do so
<Lambda> night peoples
<Aicebo> gnite
*LaptopAristeo also assumes that people are heterosexual unless they say otherwise
<LaptopAristeo> If I assume people are straight and they're gay, it usually ends up better than if I assume they're gay and they're straight
<Aicebo> lol
<Aicebo> I'm not one to freak out and go OMG U OFFENDED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Aicebo> :P
<LaptopAristeo> Or bisexual or pansexual or one of those other flavors
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, a lot of people are like that
<Aicebo> "flavors" lol
<LaptopAristeo> I get offended when people are easily offended though, too many people these days are easily offended and it requires an expert in diplomacy to even operate in today's world
<Aicebo> yeah, whenever I'm trying to make new friends I like NEVER state my opinions or views on ANYTHING
<Aicebo> :'D
<LaptopAristeo> Hehe
<Aicebo> and I ESPECIALLY never make my mean vegan jokes until I know it's someone that eats meat
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, I'm in the same baot
<LaptopAristeo> I'd be a vegan if meat wasn't so darn tastey
<Aicebo> people need to get over themselves
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah :/
<Aicebo> especially if they're on the internet oversensitive people dont belong on the internet
<LaptopAristeo> Exactly
<Aicebo> one of my friends had a breakdown coz I said I didn't like Nickleback
<Aicebo> it's like REALLY CMON GIRL
<LaptopAristeo> Haha, yeah
<LaptopAristeo> Haven't experienced that
<LaptopAristeo> I guess it's emotionalism or something
<LaptopAristeo> Or maybe I'm too intellectually honest and people know how I feel about things, maybe I need to hide my opinions a bit better
<Aicebo> lol mhm
<LaptopAristeo> It's the INTJ in me though
<LaptopAristeo> http://typelogic.com/intj.html
<LaptopAristeo> 'Anyone considered to be "slacking," including superiors, will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware of this'
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<LaptopAristeo> And KE$HA likes my beard :3
<Aicebo> LOL
<LaptopAristeo> I wish I could be more like the guy on that clip on my Facebook profile
<LaptopAristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8GcPWyE2k
*LaptopAristeo thinks schools need a little bit of that guy
*LaptopAristeo wonders if Aicebo would want him as a principle >.>
<LaptopAristeo> or principal
<LaptopAristeo> I always forget
<Aicebo> principal
<Aicebo> idk since I don't go to school :P
<LaptopAristeo> kk
<LaptopAristeo> :O
<LaptopAristeo> homeschool?
<Aicebo> yeah
<LaptopAristeo> Or are you too cool for school?
<LaptopAristeo> Oh
*LaptopAristeo did that
<Aicebo> I have no idea what form of school I'll be doing this year
<Aicebo> I have no intention of doing any school after I get a diploma though
<LaptopAristeo> My student gov. vice president was homeschooled too :3
<LaptopAristeo> sooooooo
*LaptopAristeo always gets giggles when people say that homeschoolers don't know how to deal with people :3
<Aicebo> lol
<Aicebo> it's not that I dont know how to deal with people I just don't think it's worth it to waste so many hours and wake up so early all the time when I can get [censored] done faster and on my own schedule at home
<Aicebo> I'm already kind of got my own thing going on I'm home alone most the day so I have the time to myself and I'm already pretty close to having an actual task for the job I want
<LaptopAristeo> I thought school was a waste of time
<LaptopAristeo> College is nice though, because they can print out pieces of paper saying that you accomplished something
<Aicebo> brb
<LaptopAristeo> kk
<Aicebo> back
<Aicebo> hmmmm well college isnt really a necessity to what I wanna do
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<LaptopAristeo> What do you want to do?
<Aicebo> music video editing
<Aicebo> it'd be different if it was movie editing but I'm not interested in huge stuff like that
<Aicebo> I am currently drawing a cat with red eyes a purple nose, yellow year insides, green fur tufts and legs, orange sideburns and a green and orange striped tail
<Aicebo> I think I'll make the rest blue
<Aicebo> his name shall be Druggles
<Aicebo> :D
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<LaptopAristeo> That's cool :D
<Aicebo> yes
<Aicebo> he is also very angry looking
<LaptopAristeo> hehe

<Aristeo> Like a class C felony though
<where> It's not?
<where> As in, it's not already a felony
<where> ?
<Corevette789> It is if you shine them at Airplanes
<Corevette789> And people while they are driving I think
<where> I thought that it would be to do it to anyone at all
<where> Seeing as they warn you not to look into them, on the packaging.
<where> And logically, shining it into someone else's eyes would be bad.
<where> :p

<Aristeo> soooo
<Aristeo> I just got a really interesting PM on Facebook >.>
<Aristeo> "You need to remember why you are in the position you are in and not use it as a power trip. Other than that I think you are a pretty cool guy. Hope sga [student government] is great this year."
<Aristeo> And I was liek
<Aristeo> Baby baby baby OHHHH
<Aristeo> But I didn't say that
<Aristeo> I said "umm.... thanks :)" and then ".... wait, what part am I power tripping over?"
<Aristeo> and he said "Well i just remember the whole deal with Ms Rian and how you said that this was your job and so on when she made the whole shabang"
<Aristeo> And I was like uhhhhhhhhhhh.......
<Aristeo> People are wierd
<Stormy> Guess who commented on my youtube profile
<Lambda> Doppel
<Aristeo> :o
<RedDragonX> God
<Lambda> I saw that actually
<Aristeo> Lambda: Stalker!
<RedDragonX> it's her bf he has the right to stalk
<Lambda> I was bored and browsing youtube and wanted to watch your video of peaches and I saw that
<Stormy> :P
<RedDragonX> btw Aristeo you still need to add Stitch to the staff section
<Stormy> "Are you still made about my comment a long time ago?" --- No, but I never really liked you anyways so stop trying to talk to me
<Aristeo> I was actually about to type something
*Aristeo had the query window open and everything
<Aristeo> RedDragonX can read my mind >.>
<Stormy> And I've been meaning to point that out
<Stormy> But I keep forgetting
<RedDragonX> hehe
<Lambda> Stormy: or howabout this "You're a creepy stalker and I want you to stop trying to talk to me"
<Stormy> Or
<Stormy> "Hey look! It's Cynder! *runs*"
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> I like that one
<RedDragonX> They even making another spyro game anyone know?
<Stormy> eww Spyro
<Lambda> I dunno
<Lambda> it's one of the last games on my radar honestly
<Lambda> :P
<RedDragonX> ohhh
<RedDragonX> I forgot Aura told me
<Stormy> They've been "making another game" for a long time now
<Ryft> wat
<Lambda> sup Ryft
<Stormy> But no one seems to have any information about it
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks: Do you live around Vancouver?
<Lambda> except ixr's Activision friend
<Ryft> lol
<Lambda> but he hasn't been able to get a hold of him last time he called
<Aristeo> I wish I had a stalker
<Lambda> O.o
<Aristeo> Would be a nice self-esteem boost
<Ryft> wat
<Ryft> o.O
<RedDragonX> Aura sent me a message about it
<Ryft> xD
<Stormy> Aristeo, trust me
<Lambda> why would you want a stalker?
<RedDragonX> She's working in the video game field
<Stormy> You do not want a stalker like Doppel
<Aristeo> Well, maybe a part time stalker
<Lambda> XD
<RedDragonX> Doppel will draw you in several fantasies
<Stormy> I thought Aura24 was like 13
<Aristeo> Someone who likes everything I post on Facebook and is a little creepy
<Stormy> o.O
<Aristeo> But not *too* creepy
<RedDragonX> Aura is 18 I think
<Stormy> Oh, right
<RedDragonX> She just started College
<Stormy> still kind of young to be in the field though
<RedDragonX> she usually tells me anything that gets passed her way
<Stormy> So all she told you was "they're making a new Spyro game"?
<Stormy> We've known that for like, ever
<RedDragonX> no she sent me stuff that just kinda points to little things
<RedDragonX> like the same composers are not part of it and That Chris Wilson is working on Crash bandicoot now
<Lambda> Chris Wilson?
<Stormy> lol, like Crash Bandicoot needs any more screwing up
<RedDragonX> and that the next game maintains LoS universe but still goes in a new direction or something
<Lambda> whozzat
<Stormy> I don't see where they can go with the LoS universe after defeating the big bad guy
<Lambda> make a new Big Bad
<Lambda> easy
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> and make it look like s/he existed all along
<RedDragonX> idk if the story is any the same
<Stormy> Yeah, another purple dragon who was prophesized to destroy the world
<RedDragonX> all she said was they were maintaining the characters
<Lambda> like Davy Jones on Pirates of the Caribbean
<Stormy> It would make perfect sense, just like the first three LoS games
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> Characters like, personalities and everything?
<RedDragonX> the next one has Blackbeard in it :D
<Stormy> [censored] it
<RedDragonX> WOHOOO
<Stormy> I hate Spyro's personality
<Stormy> He's boring
<Lambda> [21:57] <&Stormy> [censored] it
<Lambda> f u c k ?
<RedDragonX> That's ok, that's why God made fanfiction
<Stormy> Lambda: d4amn
<Lambda> ooh
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> I was gonna say
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> Yeah, unless they make some major changes I'm not going to be buying the next game
<RedDragonX> anyways the next PotC has blackbeard in it :D
<Lambda> we could rent it for fun though
<Stormy> No
<Stormy> That would cost money
<Stormy> I like money
<RedDragonX> lol
*RedDragonX has enough money not to care
<Stormy> Screw you
<Stormy> :(
*RedDragonX shares money with Stormy
<Lambda> but but but
<Stormy> :D
<Lambda> renting the Twilight movies costed money too
<Lambda> and that was fun
<RedDragonX> lol
<ixr> My activision "friend"?
<Stormy> true...
<Lambda> besides
<Lambda> it would be my money
<RedDragonX> because it was worth her rediculing every scene I bet
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> But I didn't pay for them
<Stormy> You did
<Lambda> when I say "we could rent" I mean I pay
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> I'm the bf
<Lambda> it's my job
*RedDragonX drains Lambda's bank account
<Stormy> In that case, if you want to waste your time on a guararnteed [censored] game, be my guest
<Lambda> D:
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> more money for me
<Lambda> I want us to
<Lambda> it would be fun to mock
<ixr> Lol
<RedDragonX> you should have seen me at the Eclipse movie
<RedDragonX> it was funny
<ixr> Screw that id get it first
<Stormy> You went to Eclipse in theaters!?!
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> No
<RedDragonX> at a drive in
<Lambda> okay now that's just wrong
<RedDragonX> and I only went for the second movie
<Stormy> Why? :P
<RedDragonX> because they show two movies
<Lambda> Stephanie Meyer actually gets money that way :P
<Stormy> OH
<RedDragonX> and I didn't pay for it
<Stormy> -caps
<RedDragonX> so it was fun to make fun of the whole thing
<Lambda> OH, huh?
<Lambda> :P
<RedDragonX> my sister kept telling me to shut up
<Stormy> Shut up
<RedDragonX> but I just got louder
<Stormy> I held down the shift key too long
*Aristeo is planning on visiting Vancouver in the winter
<Stormy> what's in Vancouver?
<Lambda> Canadians
<Lambda> and that's about it\
<Stormy> Besides them

<Stormy> But I'm not sure
<Lambda> XD
<ixr> Oh [censored]
<ixr> Im gonna need my buddy cynderbender
<ixr> But i think that since they did lie to me and if they are making another game that they should give me it before anyone else
<ixr> Or something bad might happens
*ixr takes a puff of a cigar
<ixr> Something very bad
*Ryft beats ixr and takes the cigar

<Lambda> I thought you meant you accidentally came here and I was confused
<Stormy> I was going to say it came out of habit from always joining spyrochat
<Neon> Oh, what a surprise.
<Aristeo> It's illegal in BC?
*Neon will not abuse it this time.
*Stormy makes it so everyone who joins #pokemanz gets op

<LaptopAristeo> I'm not even hairy D:
<LaptopAristeo> Except on my head

<DarkTruth> ;)
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<where> :o
<where> fffff
*where fail'd
<where> :(
<Curly> missed :p
<where> I wont this time.
*where shoots Curly again
<where> >:D
<Curly> DX
*where bandaids Curly's face up :)//(::[:D]::)
<where> :D
<Curly> (::[:(]::)
<where> D:
*where removes the bullets first
<Spyrorocks> its funny how those pirate bay founders deny any activity in the site
<Spyrorocks> the main programmer says he never did anything for the site
<Curly> they did?
<Spyrorocks> and only acted as a spokesperson
<Curly> I thought they just said they don't have anything to do with the illegal torrents
<where> I thought they'd just be denying any involvement in illegal activities on it?
<where> lol hivemind Curly
<Spyrorocks> No, Peter Sunde said he only acted as a spokesperson for the site and never did any of the programming
<Spyrorocks> when he was the lead programmer....
<Spyrorocks> and server manager.
<where> Well, what do you expect though Spyrorocks?
<Curly> why would he deny that? that seems weird
<where> Everyone knows that they made the site for illegal file sharing
<where> And it's not like he'd go and say 'Yeah, I made it for illegal file sharing.'
<Spyrorocks> Curly, because he doesnt want to go to prison.
<Curly> but what's wrong with programming a torrent sharing website?
<Spyrorocks> Hes trying to distance himself from the activites
<Spyrorocks> and the letters he sent back to anti priacy companies insulting them
<Spyrorocks> technically a torrent site doesnt hold anything illegal
<Spyrorocks> but it does facilliate copyright infrigment
<Spyrorocks> but nothing more than what google can do.
<Spyrorocks> It obvious everyone knows that the site was made for sharing copyrighted material and peter was the lead programmer
<Spyrorocks> but they need to prove that in court.
<Spyrorocks> which is hard.
<Curly> unless he personally put torrents on the website himself I can't see how he could be liable
<Spyrorocks> refusing to remove copyrighted torrents
<Spyrorocks> so he was aware of the activities but let it go anyways.
<Curly> oh. that might be more shakey
<Spyrorocks> although i dont know how the laws in sweden are
<Spyrorocks> in usa they have the DCMA
<Spyrorocks> which means if you send them a notice they must comply
<Spyrorocks> but they are not bound by that.
<Spyrorocks> in court they were obviously trying to get out on a technicality, but it bit them on the butt and they got sued.
<Spyrorocks> anyways bed time, gnite.
<Stitch> But why go through all that, trying to find who's responsible, while the website still runs? Just shut it down!
<Andres> Brb
<Curly> how do you shut down a website without justifying yourself? >.>
<Stitch> I think there's about 2,000+ links on that website to justify it.
<Stitch> 200,000+ actually.
*Stitch was aiming too low.
*Stitch probably still is.
<Curly> but Google has tons of links to pirated material too
<Curly> and they haven't done anything about it
<where> 3.065.055 torrents.
<where> According to the main page.
<Curly> that doesn't mean they're all illegal
<Curly> although most of them probably are >.>
<where> No, but the vast majority of them are.
*Curly has no big issue with piracy herself
<where> And google doesn't manage the sites they link to, Curly.
<Curly> they can block them though
<where> Whereas TPB manages what's on their site.
<Curly> and they haven't done that have they :O
<Curly> they haven't even tried
<Curly> Google's anti-censorship though
<Curly> which I like
<Curly> even if that means not blocking the bad things >.>
<Curly> although I don't care about piracy one way or the other :X
<where> i suppose it's up to you to do the right thing in the end.
<Curly> which is? >.>
<where> Not to break the law.
<Curly> I don't think the law is the be all end all
<where> Of course, one could argue that current laws need changing.
<where> Exactly, Curly.
<DarkTruth> alright I am going to sleep
<DarkTruth> this night has sucked anyway
<DarkTruth> :/
<Andres> Good night, LightLie! D:
*Andres gives the LightLie a kiss on the forehead and hopes she has naughty dreams of niceness :o

*Andres aristeos tuckbedwhere into laptop
<where> O_o
*where fires ones and zeroes at Andres
*Andres noms the numbers by the number!
<where> :D
<Curly> mmm... *just thought of a new thing to stress over*
<where> D:
*where delays leaving to fix Curly
<Curly> I went to apply somewhere today, but I didn't think at all about the interview and now I need to get some time to investigate the company and the store >_>
<where> Right.
<where> :o
<Curly> and I'm going to start my graveyard shift job tomo... tonight
<Curly> so how am I supposed to find time for that >_<

<Deathbat> When I made facebook it was the thing that EVERYONE was on, such as Bebo
<Deathbat> RIP Bebo
<Swaffy> RIP PS1
<Aristeo> Well, I'm gonna go get my oil changed
<Andres> D:
<Deathbat> Is it just me or do even PS2s seem outdated now?
<Icydragon3D> 12At where I used to live, it was myspace.... I move around enough to notice these things...
<OilChangeAristeo> If Sally comes back, tell her I'll be back in 25-30 minutes
<Icydragon3D> 12Deathbat: It is...
<jasperdett> k
<Icydragon3D> 12I guess...
<Andres> Aristeo's gears and such needed some oil, since they are getting rusty :o
<Rain> lol
<nintendofreak> yeah ps2 are dead i think there were only 5 games reelased on it this year so far
<Swaffy> I play PSX games on my laptop now. The console isn't as reliable.
<Deathbat> I miss the excitement of buying an awesome new PS2 game
<Swaffy> Like Spyro.
<Icydragon3D> 12Everythings about graphics now...
<Deathbat> All these PS3 and Wii games are stupidly expensive!
<Deathbat> Yeah, like spyro :(
<nintendofreak> wii only $50 ...... n64 were 50 ps1 were 50 back int he 90's but i definitely agree about ps3 $60 way too much for a short game
<nintendofreak> i'll quit gaming if next gen systems games are $70......
<Deathbat> Wii games are between £20 and £40 here.
*Andres is on fire!
<Deathbat> If you look hard enough in some shops you can get the odd DS game for £10
<Deathbat> But they're usually the crap ones that nobody plays, like the crossword ones >_>
<Rain> ?
<Swaffy> "Everythings about graphics now,,," And that is why I still thoroughly enjoy my Battlefield 1942 game. It's the first Battlefield game that was ever released.
<nintendofreak> graphics arn't important to me why i got a wii :p
<Andres> Mrrrnrrmrr. Mrawrnrr. Mrrrrrrnrr. Mrr.
<Andres> I should totally record myself saying that.

<Rain> hmm
<Rain> shy
<Rain> LK?
<LK> hi
<Rain> hello
<LK> Sup?
<junh1024-XDCC> drfsupercenter depends if you invert the rear
<Rain> mew
<junh1024-XDCC> if you don't, it'd be the same as if you inverted the phase of one of them as stereo
<junh1024-XDCC> if you did, you'd get silence
<Rain> !op
<Rain> !deop
<drfsupercenter> 03in English?
<drfsupercenter> 03would it sound good or not
<junh1024-XDCC> it'd sound as good as if you inverted the phase of one of L or R in stereo
<LK> Hello
<junh1024-XDCC> you want me to say that in cantonese then?
*junh1024-XDCC hide
<Rain> hii
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Rain> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03invert the phase though... what's that sound like?
<junh1024-XDCC> Full reset: check invert phase for one of them
<junh1024-XDCC> or use stereo expander
<drfsupercenter> 03full reset does what?
<junh1024-XDCC> use the Full reset preset in channel mixer & check invert phase for one of them
<drfsupercenter> 03but what does it do to the sound?
<junh1024-XDCC> full reset is exactly what it says
<junh1024-XDCC> i'm modifying it from a full reset
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but full reset does what... mutes it?
<junh1024-XDCC> no
<junh1024-XDCC> resets it back to defaults
<junh1024-XDCC> which is normal
<junh1024-XDCC> or use graphic panner: full reset and draw zigzags in the first tab
<Light_Lati> night Quan~
<drfsupercenter> 03wait full reset is just like nu8ll transform?
<drfsupercenter> 03-8
<junh1024-XDCC> yes, to make sure we're on the same in terms of settings
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so then what o.o
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Gooooooood night, everyone.

<Ryft> But but
<Ryft> I'm totally going to propose when I get out there D:
<Aristeo> What he doesn't know won't hurt :3
<Stormy> I'm right-clicking on people's names for the nick list commands and the menu doesn't open
*Rain pats Ryft
<Ryft> but but
<Rain> ish otay

<Ryft> I don't know o.o
<Lambda> I get that bar too but the menu's beneath it
<Lambda> =/
<Rain> hmm
*Stormy wonders if it's a compatibility issue
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> like with the crossover to Widnows 7?
<Lambda> *Windows
<Stormy> just a guess, I really have no idea
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> it would make sense to me
<Lambda> I could test it
<Lambda> moving my hard drive to our windows 7 computer
<Stormy> test it how?
<Stormy> oh
<Lambda> and loading up IceChat
<Lambda> I've been meaning to test this out on another computer anyway

<Lambda> aww
<Stormy> ?
<Lambda> it was working great until I actually tried connecting to the server
<Stormy> what was?
<Lambda> then it gave me some error about not being able to create a package
<Lambda> IceChat
<Lambda> on the Windows7 PC
<Lambda> I'm back on the laptop now
<Stormy> yeah, probably some compatibility issues
<Stormy> it was coded in 2008
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> probably doesn't have Windows 7 in mind
<Lambda> :P
*Stormy needs to find a newer IRC client
<Lambda> the one I was suggesting earlier
<Lambda> what was it called again?
<Stormy> I don't remember
<Stormy> Maybe I'll just get mIRC or something
<Lambda> smuxi
<Lambda> mIRC is only a free trial remember
<Lambda> then you have to pay
<Lambda> or just redo the trial
<Stormy> well yeah
<Lambda> but that would be like stealing
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> uh
<Stormy> what do you see for my hostmask
<Lambda> blueflame
<Stormy> that's the ident
<Stormy> what comes after that?
<Lambda> and then all the usual numbers

<Stormy> all you have to do is click the buttons

<RN|out> 04Fail connection
<Hawkie> Ra
<Articuno> 12Fail -v-
<Articuno> 12#Hi Hawkie
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04lol the ghost thing isn't working
<Hawkie> Hey Articuno
<Hawkie> How are you?
<Hawkie> Hey RN
<Articuno> 12Thats the second PM I've sent you RN XD
<Articuno> 12I;m a bit P****ed off to say the least#
<Articuno> 12Yesterday Lugia barely worked on TST and today he said he'd be here all day to work on it, well he's not. And he won;t answer his damn phone
<Hawkie> Ugh he's quiiiite unreliable
<Articuno> 12Quite??
<Articuno> 12I've never known anyone so unreliable
<Articuno> 12¬¬
<Hawkie> Articuno: If you haven't figured out, I am excellent at understating things
<Articuno> 12He's probably left his phone somewhere, or has it on silent or something stupid like that
<Articuno> 12??? ok? That's random
<Hawkie> Not really - [16:37:29] <Articuno> Quite?? <- was in reply to you sounding peeved at me not expressing just how unreliable he is with a stronger word
<Articuno> 12No no
<Hawkie> Oh XD;
<Articuno> 12-v-
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Ah it's because RN|out isn't a registered nick, please can one of the mods kick it for me?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04got to go now anyway, picking Burnett up from work ^^
<Articuno> 12forget it, I hate mIRC and text geting misinterpreted
<Articuno> 12Also I seem to have just misread what you said
<Articuno> 12I misread understating as understanding -_____-
<Articuno> 12thats why it came across as random to me LOOOOOOOL
<Hawkie> Oh!
<Hawkie> Fff-
<Hawkie> I was getting prepared to defend myself because Arrow frequently prods me for these things
<Hawkie> Being unclear, understating things, etc
<Hawkie> Sorries ^^;
<Hawkie> That said Arti
<Hawkie> I temp blocked both him and Ms. Maine Girl
<Articuno> 12Well I was just emphasising how unreliable he is because of how annoyed I am at him right now lol#
<Articuno> 12Well good
<Hawkie> She would NOT let me go yesterday and had me explain my feelings around the two of them being together
<Hawkie> got me into a 'ffdhjkf no you, stop it' mood
<Hawkie> Arrow's just feeling a sense of defeat as far as I'm concerned - well, I'll be back for the two of them eventually, it's terrible to block communication like that but I feel I have to.
<Hawkie> I'll be talking to Arrow in a few days, because I know he's sensitive to feeling ignored and put aside, will be resentful if I don't show up eventually
<Hawkie> But beyond that
<Hawkie> I'll try and keep them at a distance like that
<Articuno> 12Well whats worse? Him feeling like that or you telling him the truth that you don't want to hear abotu him and another girl?
<Hawkie> I think the former in all honesty
<Articuno> 12Why didnt you tell him the truth then?
<Hawkie> Wait - I did actually
<Hawkie> remember the three points he replied to?
<Articuno> 12Oh yes
<Hawkie> that's why he feels defeated
<Hawkie> I think
<Hawkie> if I told him
<Hawkie> "Hey you, stop talking about Marissa in my presence"
<Hawkie> He'd lock up entirely
<Articuno> 12Is that worse than ignoring him then?#
<Articuno> 12*blockingh
<Articuno> 12-h
<Articuno> 12Hi J-Lugia ^^
<Articuno> 12Long time no see
<Hawkie> Yeh because if I add that about Marissa he might feel compelled to remove me from his contacts. I've seen it happen before, I've told Arrow off for too much and countered him being all weird
<Hawkie> and he withdraws entirely
<Hawkie> I want to resume contact eventually
<Hawkie> So I'm going to wait until my feelings to him die in a fire
<Hawkie> then he can talk about her all he wants.
<J-Lugia> hi Articuno! I was just out at camp ^^
<Hawkie> Hey J-Lugia!!!!!!!!!
<J-Lugia> hi Hawkie!
<J-Lugia> how you doing?
<Articuno> 12But your feelings for him might not die for a very long time..
<Hawkie> Quite true..
<Articuno> 12It'd be easier to just let him bugger off on his own and wait for him to come back because he WONT just end contact with you forever just because you were honest with him.
<Hawkie> I guess so...
<Articuno> 12You said so yourself, how many times has he done that before?
<Articuno> 12And he always comes back
<Hawkie> Lost count
<Hawkie> Sometimes I have to chase him around all over the place
<Hawkie> but he returns eventually
<Articuno> 12It's childish, it's reminding me of TimeShift just suddenly ignoring us, deleting his account and everything just because we tyold him something he didnt like
<Hawkie> I think Arrow holds me in pretty high regards still
<Hawkie> Aside from Marissa, he does IM me every day without me contacting him, heh
<Hawkie> And eh - sounds about right @ TimeShift and Arrow comparison
<Articuno> 12It's just people not having their own way
<Articuno> 12anyway -v- I said I wouldnt give you anymore advice but I find myself doing it without even thinking .. argh
<Hawkie> Sorries
<Hawkie> I'll just
<Articuno> 12Meh, not your fault
<Hawkie> go about putting up some photos on facebook I think
<Hawkie> Some things from the trip..
<Hawkie> None of Arrow, though
<Hawkie> Just those of me
<Articuno> 12brb
<Hawkie> Ok
<Articuno> 12Gonna be on and off, BBQ.

<Articuno> 12Why did they reveal it as if it was some big thing?
<Aurora> 6oh

<Aurora> 6n

<Aurora> 6bye all
<AeroDracohem> bye Roara~ O:
<Soyuz> its a thingy
<Hideaki> hm?
<Mayze> y?
<Proto> hit my head
*Aristeo hugs Proto's brain
<Soyuz> Fallout 2 nostalgia
<Aristeo> :o
*Aristeo likes Fallout 3 ^^
<Soyuz> "whats a hydronehaowhatever?"
<Soyuz> "hajahakagaskhccogghgkagdkaH well technically,...its called a thingy"
<Soyuz> Fallout 3 is meh
<Soyuz> but expansions were cool
<Soyuz> if they made it more to the original fallout universe with the realisms of it then it'd be better
<Soyuz> like how Super mutants are like the rats of Fallout 3
<Soyuz> easily killable
<Soyuz> that and I find it odd that in Fallout 2, they were already rebuilding society pretty well
<Soyuz> Vault City, Gecko, etc
<Soyuz> while in Fallout 3 it was like Fallout 1 but basically you take alot of stuff away
<Soyuz> the simularity is that there is only one vault that seems to be livable
<Soyuz> and the rest are dead or infested
<eXAKR> http://failblog.org/2010/08/17/epic-fail-photos-superior-technology-fail/
<Soyuz> Aristeo; so fallout 3 for what system?
<Aristeo> Xbox 360 and PC
<Aristeo> I think
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Aristeo> It might be on PS3 by now too
<Soyuz> do you mod it?
<AeroDracohem> XDD
<Soyuz> it is
<Soyuz> with all its expansions
<Hideaki> Lolwut, when did this chat become actine o-o
<Soyuz> actine?
<Hideaki> 03active*
<Hideaki> 03.-.
<Soyuz> when I said Fallout
<Aristeo> Hi Lambda :)
<Lambda> hey
<Soyuz> but yeah,Aristeo, I'd recommend adding mods from Fallout Nesus
<Soyuz> *nexus
<Aristeo> Like what?
<Soyuz> it depends really
<Soyuz> some mods deal with Deathclaws looking more like from Fallout 2
<Soyuz> more Deathclaw-ish
<Soyuz> (Mother Deathclaws are devils to kill btw >>)
<Soyuz> and then theres others that deal with homes
<Soyuz> stories
<Soyuz> etc
<Aristeo> All of them are annoying to kill
<Soyuz> and some just to add cool armour
<Aristeo> I wish it would take less bullets to kill things
<Soyuz> well thats the point
<Soyuz> only with Fallout 1 and 2 it took more on chances and if you're skilled/dumb enough to take something stronger then you
<Soyuz> like for instance Harry
<Soyuz> only way I killed him was because of my combat shotgun
<Aristeo> Lambda: How're you?
<Lambda> alright
<Soyuz> which costed about over 4,000 bottlecaps
<Lambda> cussing at facebook
<Mayze> yay!
<Soyuz> supplied by DAVID KEITH
<Aristeo> Hehe
<Soyuz> I love how he was in Fallout 1 as the (spolierspolierspolier)
<Soyuz> though one thing I loath with Fallout 3 is that it has confusing morals
<Soyuz> like for instance in ten penny tower you kill the ghouls you are bad
<Soyuz> you kill the rich snobs you are bad
<Soyuz> you make them live together so they might kill one another you are good
<Soyuz> or how the enclave literally spilts because of the 2nd genocide plan they have
<Blazaking> whoa
<Blazaking> activity
<Blazaking> and fallout 3
<Soyuz> but at least it isnt a complete copy like Fallout New Vegas
<Soyuz> which is just Van Buren only...its by Bethseda
<Blazaking> lol
<Lambda> so I clicked this link someone gave me in a facebook IM
<Lambda> and it redirected me to a page that had me sign into facebook
<Lambda> ...only I was too stupid to check the url
<Lambda> am I screwed?
<Lambda> I changed my password immediately
<Lambda> and ran a virus scan
<Lambda> and made sure no harmful procceses were running
<Soyuz> also lol
<Soyuz> enclave talk on fallout 2 is fucking hilarious
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<AeroDracohem> gtg now
<AeroDracohem> bye~
<Soyuz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXwlDWPBnzU&feature=related
<Stormy> hopefully it only got your old facebook password
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Stormy> that's what I don't get though
<Lambda> yeah
<Stormy> if that's all it does
<Lambda> why set up an entire domain for it?
<Stormy> how are random people's facebook passwords valuable to anyone?
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> that too
<Stormy> that's why I think it must do more
<Lambda> it was a co.cc
<Lambda> like we almost used for our site
<Stormy> co.cc domains are free
<Lambda> oh okay
<Lambda> nevermind then
<Stormy> I think
<Lambda> throws my suspicion out the window
<Lambda> or at least that part of it
<Stormy> So the site
<Stormy> Did it look exactly like the facebook login page?
<Lambda> exactly
<Lambda> same logos
<Lambda> same links
<Lambda> even had my email automatically entered in
<Lambda> all I need to put in was the password
<Stormy> I wish I had a junk computer I don't care about so I could check it our
<Stormy> *out
<Lambda> as long as you don't put the password in it might be fine
<Stormy> might be
<Lambda> I could screenshot it otherwise
<Stormy> you never know
<Stormy> Don't go to it again!
<Stormy> D:
*Proto blinks several times
<Proto> this headache sucks
<Stormy> I was more curious about the source code and where the other links lead to
<Proto> also hi Stormy and Lambda
<Lambda> hey Proto
<Proto> hi
<Stormy> Hi Proto
<Lambda> oh stuff like that
<Lambda> how are you today?
<Proto> hi
<Lambda> other than the headache
<Proto> same as yesterday
<Lambda> :(
<Proto> maybe worse, can't tell really
<Lambda> just avoid facebook at all costs and you won't get worse
<Proto> I don't have a book of faces, but thanks for the advice
<Lambda> you are a smart man
<Lambda> I used to not have one
<Proto> I would go that far
<Proto> wouldn't*
<Lambda> I got one so some guy would know Stormy and me were together without having to be an asshole to him
<Lambda> XD
<Proto> I think that smack on the head knocked a few points off my iq
<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> oh noes
<Lambda> how did you smack your head?
<Proto> I stood up under the mirror of a big suv who parked close to the line, had dropped a bottle and bent down to pick it up
<Lambda> >.>
<Proto> hit it hard enough to make the mirror go up and down a bit
<Lambda> I can see how that ended
<Proto> I felt that with my head
<Proto> it's been like three hours
<Lambda> I've hit me head on table corners doing that many times
<Proto> and a tylenol
<Proto> lol, I was getting a drink of water in middle school once, and the water fountains in most places are recessed into the walls and didn't step back far enough one day, side of my head on a concrete block wall
<Proto> I get hurt a lot
<Stitch> We've noticed.
<Proto> go back to FFR stitch
<Stitch> HUMPH.
*Stitch storms off.
<Stormy> D:
*Proto tackels Stitch
<Proto> m/en gives up on spelling right
*Stitch continues storming off.
*Proto holds onto Stitch's ankle
*Lambda observes while eating some movie theater candy
*Stitch plays the song that is likely to give him carpal tunnel.
*Proto mumbles something
<Proto> I'm getting gta iv tomorrow
<Proto> and pizza
<Proto> and my schedule for school, which is the next day
<Proto> :(
<Lambda> once again
<Lambda> II'll switch school starting days with you
<Lambda> :P
<Proto> I don't think that'll work
<Stitch> Owowowowowowowow my wriiiist.

<Stitch> Proto, do you seeeeeee?
<Proto> No
<Sneas> Still no AC at work, but at least there's 2 new fans
<Stitch> ..
<Stitch> Go seeeeeee!
<Hawkie> Sigh
<Hawkie> Sometimes
<Hawkie> It feels like nothing changed
<Hawkie> The tone of which I'm being talked to
<Hawkie> The topic
<Hawkie> The easy flow of the conversation
<Hawkie> It feels like time is standing still - and yet, coming to reality...
<Hawkie> Everything is so different.
<Soyuz> ...wow
<Soyuz> this super mutant looks ridculous
<Sneas> Thankfully I'm off the next 4 days :3
<Sneas> Lolwut
<Soyuz> http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Tabitha
<Soyuz> this is the 'leader' of what remains of the Master's Army in The Majove Desert
<Soyuz> and New Vegas...actually looks kinda good
<Soyuz> as if it actually progressed in the past 200 hundreds
<Soyuz> *200 years
<Soyuz> though interesting they put religious groups back in Fallout
<Soyuz> Followers of the Apocolypse, Mormons, etc

<Soyuz> Drake; o3o
<Drake> 04?
<Kipi> Junior year is okay. It depends on what you've been doing, but it's a bit funner since you'll probably have a few of the smelly classes out of the way.

<Ripred> 2what does interlacing it do?
<Ripred> 2make all the layers go together or something?
<Quanyails> 7Interlaced PNGs are different from ordinary PNGs in that the code varies by having a stichlike weaving. It looks no different than normal PNG, which uses a linear code.

<Lambda> I told it to automatically sign me in after every vist and that fixed it
<Mikey> if you guys click on "log in automatically" when you log in it won't do that
<Mikey> yeah
<Lambda> RDX's forum did that too
<May> you'd like lost symbol then
<Neon> I don't want to.
<Neon> :P
<Mikey> then you just log out whenever your actually done
<May> but it's a whopping 600 pages, I think
<Lambda> he got it fixed somehow
<Light_Latias> I'm not at home
<May> I read it when it first came out so, lol, I don't remember
<Lambda> I never go to his though
<Blazaking> All right, all right

<Lambda> when Ryft came in
<Mikey> XDD
<May> and confirmation for brocolli pokemon is indeed up in the news
<Neon> Yeah. :P
<Ripred> 2>_<
<Ripred> 2 5 gen looks so stupid
<Mikey> K. become addicted plz. http://muzicmatters.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?t=568
<May> anyways, I need to eat
<Lambda> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03<Ripred> 5 gen looks so stupid <- thank you
<drfsupercenter> 03for once I agree iwth you
<drfsupercenter> 035th gen IS stupid
<Lambda> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03I
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll probably still buy the games for kicks
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<Lambda> the merge is finally happening
<Ripred> 2i thought you agreed with me on journey being awesome too
<Neon> Thanks, G.I. Joe.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Lambda> do you guys know about it?
<Ryft> Took 'em long enough
<Neon> I heard about it.
<Ripred> 2:3
<Lambda> I know very little of the other network though
<Neon> Waht's the other network called?
<Lambda> not sure I like the guys I know from it
<Lambda> darchoods
<Mikey> merge....will it be called a different server or will it still be called epic-chat
<Neon> *what's
<Ripred> 2:{
<Blazaking> All right fine do it
<Light_Lati> D:
<Lambda> we will be a different network
<Neon> EpicHoodsDarkChat.
<Ripred> 2aero never once messaged me back on me RO related messages D:
<Lambda> we're using their name by the sound of it
<Light_Latias> oxo
<Lambda> see Stormy and I were talking
<Blazaking> Now what test
<Light_Latias> I don't feel comfortable saying it...
<Lambda> we think everyone should've had a say in what the new name is
<Lambda> instead only the network ops did
<Lambda> and even then
<Neon> Eeep.
<Blazaking> All right, all right, I give.
<Neon> That's sort of fair, though.
<Lambda> they waited until the people who opposed their idea (like Stormy) were asleep and just used their name
<Lambda> so now the network will be called darchoods
<Neon> Okay, never mind.
<Lambda> :/
<Neon> Wow.
<Lambda> the other idea was darc-chat
<DarkTruth> with another network ?
<DarkTruth> what network >_>
<Lambda> which I liked so much more
<Neon> D ouchebaggery.
<Neon> Excuse my language.
<Lambda> I thought so yeah
<Lambda> also darc-side came up
<Neon> XD
<Neon> Nice.
<Lambda> I changed my nick to Vader and said I'd be the mascot
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe she doesn't like you :P

<OptimoosNyra> T\It needs more cowbell?
<OptimoosNyra> Oh, right.
<SheenaFox> *You
<OptimoosNyra> *It
<Lambda> he has literally had no input
<Ripred> 2you*
<SheenaFox> Also, you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do
<Ripred> 2:{
<OptimoosNyra> He's basically estranged from it, right?
<Ripred> 2did i say i was forcing... >_>
<Lambda> I suppose so
<Ripred> 2i was pointing out the better things in it
<drfsupercenter> 03ircops can :D
<Lambda> he's just rich enough to own it
*drfsupercenter runs
*OptimoosNyra sighs.
<drfsupercenter> 03I can forcibly change someone'
<drfsupercenter> 03someone
<drfsupercenter> 03GAH
<Ripred> 2besides im sure i cant force him
<drfsupercenter> 03*I can forcibly change someone's nick
<OptimoosNyra> Rich in what way?
<Lambda> moolah
<drfsupercenter> 03I can also force someone to join a channel
<Lambda> so he can pay for our servers
<OptimoosNyra> He has actually invested money?
<OptimoosNyra> XDDDDDd
<Ripred> 2o_o
<Lambda> yeah to my knowledge
<SheenaFox> Force him?
<SheenaFox> Aero's a female.
<SheenaFox> o3o
<Light_Lati> lolfail
<Lambda> he's half the reason this place is running from what I've heard
<OptimoosNyra> Interesting.
<Ripred> 2>_<
<AeroDracohem> wat
*Andres is reaaallly sleepy right now :x
<OptimoosNyra> Yeah, he is.

<SheenaFox> Why yes.
<Ripred> 2NO SOUP FOR YOU
<Neon> Well, thank him for that, I suppose.
*Light_Lati adds another fail to Rip's 2
<Lambda> yeah I guess so
<Neon> He used to be so much cooler to be around.
<Light_Lati> and brb
<Lambda> so I've heard
<Neon> Now he's... cynical and strict.
<Lambda> and only ever talks about stuff he wants to talk about
<Neon> Essentially.
<SheenaFox> k
<Neon> Which is fair enough.
<Lambda> and just sits there silenty the rest of the time
<Lambda> yeah
<Neon> He only talks when he wants to fight about something.
<Lambda> that would be okay
<Mikey> agreed
<Neon> But if he's paying, let him do what he wants.
<Mikey> http://muzicmatters.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?p=8171#8171 :D?
<Lambda> if he didn't always interrrupt other conversations to do it
<DarkTruth> would be a bad idea to take a nap now
<Glacymr> 12i need to relax
<Neon> no advrtising stoopid
<Glacymr> 12too much stuff
<Lambda> what is this Mikey?
<Lambda> a loooong list of names?
<Ripred> 2i find sleeping relaxing
<Mikey> A LIST OF MOST THE MUSICIANS I'VE MET

*Mikey has too much time on her hands
<Lambda> ohh
<Lambda> wow
<Ripred> 2i should proboly go to bed
<Lambda> that's impressive
<Lambda> I've met none
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> probably* :P
<Andres> Indeed :3
<Neon> Hahaha.
<May> grammar nazi, huh?
<Andres> Since I have to get going soon. ._.
<Mikey> gooooooooooooooooood I know I've met more I just can't remember them :(
<May> I'm no good and typing, really, but I am known as a spelling nazi at my school XDD
<Lambda> since when has this channel's title been capitalized?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<Lambda> [/random notice]
<Ripred> 2lol
<Mikey> it's not capitalized to me...o___o;
<Lambda> hmm
<Neon> I love how my public journal on that site is basically just cryptic messages to myself chronicling my life at that point.
<DarkTruth> exactly
<Lambda> it says #DraconicWolves for me
<Lambda> used to say #draconicwolves
<Mikey> oh god I'm scared to look at my journal LOL
<Neon> I noticed that, too.
<SheenaFox> MAY
<Neon> Weird.
<SheenaFox> it's August.
<Lambda> Neon: Link
<Lambda> to the journal
<Neon> Okay, hold up.
<May> lol I know
<May> I gotta go
<May> bye now
<SheenaFox> 8D
<SheenaFox> bye
<Mikey> ...*deletes my own journal*
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Lambda: http://muzicmatters.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?t=340&start=0
<Neon> I can't get "King of Pain" out of my head now.
<Lambda> haha
<Mikey> I'm listening to that meg and dia album now, its alright but it's not enough to grab my attention from what I'm doing
*Andres wants to stay and play Alien Swarm with LightLie! \o/
<Neon> Freeze, turkeys!
<DarkTruth> I will later
<DarkTruth> need some sleep and will be up in a few hours after that
<Andres> :o
<Ripred> 2kk
<Ripred> 2im going to go too
<Ripred> 2bye all
*Andres is probably not very good at the game and the game probably does not run very smoothly for him :3
<Ripred> 2hopefully the site will be done tomarow T_T
<Neon> Lambda: That is extremely revealing, just so you know.
<Ripred> 2so i can actualy see it D:
<Lambda> I can tell
<Lambda> =/
<Lambda> I never knew you were so sad back then
<Neon> I trust you, though. Plus, that's all behind me. I was just being dramatixc.
<Neon> *dramatic
<DarkTruth> :X
<Lambda> I appreciate that you trust me
<Neon> I was more than sad, haha.
<Neon> No problem. You're a great guy.
<Lambda> yeah seems like borderline depression
<Lambda> thanks
<Lambda> you are too
<Neon> T'anks.
<Lambda> teary dramatic moment
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> XDX
<Neon> It's a laugh and a distraught face combined.
<Mikey> lol
<Lambda> you knwo what's ironic?
<Neon> What?
<Lambda> as I'm reading this
<Lambda> my iTunes is playing some of my music from a depressing stage in my life
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> going to bed, will be back on tomorrow maybe
<Quilava> bai LLOTS
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Cyas
<Neon> Hm... interesting.
<Lambda> it's like fate or something
<Lambda> :P
<Light_Latias> night LLotS~
<Lambda> or not fate
<Mikey> I feel like going on a nostalgia roll one day in music
<Lambda> but a sign?
<Light_Latias> <late!>
<Lambda> I dunno
<Light_Latias> I'm STILL late! DX
<Mikey> listening to the aiden albums and the mcr albums and placebo albums
<Mikey> and all that
<Lambda> Mikey: I do that occasionaly
<Mikey> <3
<Lambda> though
<Lambda> my nostalgic music isn't stuff that makes me happy
<Mikey> it makes me sad and happy all at once
<Lambda> all my positive music is recent taste
<Lambda> for a more positive mind
<Mikey> but most the sad comes from stuff about the OFF actually LOL like how we're not this tight close little community anymore
<Neon> "Like how busy, workaholic men play golf." ROFL
<Chimera> XD
*Mikey squeezes her Digger plushie
<Lambda> Neon is that from your journal?
<Neon> Yeah.
<Neon> I'm rereADING IT IN EMBARASSMENT.
<Neon> *Woah, caps.
<Lambda> dude
<Mikey> I was so embarrassed at mine I deleted it hahahah
<Lambda> this sounds a lot like how I was back then
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> sort of
<Neon> Back in the stage?
<Mikey> like I said, long lost brothers
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> yeah so to speak
<Neon> :P
<Lambda> just out of curiosity
<Lambda> were you by any chance 15?
<Mikey> 14
<Neon> In what post?
<Lambda> or 14 3v3n
<Neon> I stretches back to 14.
<Lambda> *even
<Lambda> ACCIDENTAL LEET
<Neon> *it
<Lambda> XDDDD
<Mikey> XDDD
<Lambda> I bet it's that age
<Neon> 14-15.
<Lambda> though some [censored]ty stuff did happen to me that year
<Neon> I have an earlier journal, too, but it's basically just lame boring events.
<Lambda> so freshman year of high school, right?
<Neon> Mhm.
<Lambda> same as me then
<Lambda> that was the worst year of my life
<Neon> Dammiy, that time was rough.
<Lambda> yeah it was
<Neon> Remember when... xD
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> I doubt the depressing stuff itself was the same
<Neon> That was when I stopped seeing my best friend for a year.
<Lambda> but the fact tyhat it happened at the same age
<Lambda> that happened to me too that year
<Neon> dude, you're kidding.
<Lambda> but that wasn't the depressing part >.>
<Lambda> well, second best friend
<Neon> Nah, not for me either. It was just conflict-filled.
<Lambda> he was being a [censored] and I was being a whiny brat
<Neon> He was changing, and didn't notice, and I was fed up.
<Lambda> we both needed to stop talking to each other and matue
<Lambda> *mature
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Makes sense.
<Lambda> we're best friends now
<Neon> :D
<Lambda> back then he was a major douche
<Lambda> the type who feels pleasure when making fun of others'
<Lambda> he changed for the better though
<Mikey> this reminds me of an experience too
<Lambda> Stormy still doesn't like him
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> because he sort of has flawed morals
<Neon> Yeah, that's basically how my friend was. Thing is, he was in no position to make fun of anyone.
<Mikey> isnt it amazing how sometimes the people you fight with most and it hurts most end up being one of your best friends in the end still?
<Neon> It was js\ust a result of the torment he received in middle school.
<Neon> *just
<Lambda> but he's still my best friend because he's always there for me, even when he disagrees
<Mikey> mhmm
<Lambda> [23:40] <+Mikey> isnt it amazing how sometimes the people you fight with most and it hurts most end up being one of your best friends in the end still?
<Neon> That's good.
<Lambda> that's exactly what it's like
<Light_Latias> BBL on DSi
<Mikey> yep I went through something similar with someone
<Light_Lati> BBL on DSi
<Mikey> brb
<SheenaFox> g'night
<Lambda> he's the one I did landscaping with
<Neon> Oh, okay.
<Neon> Is he on FB too?
<Neon> [/creep]
<Lambda> also the one that made movies with me
<Lambda> we have a youtube channel;
<Lambda> no he isn't
<Lambda> he hates facebook
<Neon> Haha, nice.
<Lambda> lost a lot of respect for me when I got one
<Neon> I make zombie movies with my friends. They're so bad it's funny.
<Lambda> our channel is monopolyguy19
<Neon> We make them bad on purpose.
<Andres> See you later :3
<Andres> Bai!
<Neon> Oh, I see.
<Lambda> ironically he isn't Carl
<Neon> What kind of stuff do you do?
<Lambda> but they both use monopolyguy
<Mikey> back
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> our full length movies are like yours
<Glacymr> 12sould
<AeroDracohem> gah I should probably sleep too
<AeroDracohem> laskdfj;laskdfj
<Lambda> satires of bad action movies basically
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Glacymr> 12:<
<Neon> Awesome.
<Lambda> but our stuff on youtube is simpler
<Lambda> we made a music video
<Lambda> (most recent project)
<Neon> Lol, funny or serious?
<Lambda> as well as a tribute/mockumentary of one of our friends who misteriously disppeard one day (no joke ther)
<Lambda> lol, nothing we make is serious
<Lambda> xP
<Neon> Wait, they vanished
<Lambda> *mysteriously
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> stopped coming to school
<Neon> Dude, same thing happened in eight grade for me.
<Lambda> 3 months later the kid signed into xbox live and we talked to him for like 3 hours
<Neon> This weird girl who never went to gym class just disappeared. Still registered, no notification.
<Lambda> he said he's keep in touch
<Lambda> but he didn't
<Soul> 14D:
<Soul> 14I barely got on
<Neon> Huh.
<Neon> Could it be Witness Protection, lol?
<Soul> 14and I didn't say goodbye D:
<Lambda> he gave us a phone number
<Soul> 14anyways
<Lambda> nobody answered
<Soul> 14this comic seriously made me lol irl
<Soul> 14http://www.deviantart.com/#/d2x0lu5
<Lambda> or at least
<Lambda> the wrong person did
<Lambda> you know what was freaky ashell though?
<Neon> What?
<Lambda> before he signed into Live I got a voice message from him
<Lambda> only it wasn;t his voice
<Neon> D:
<Lambda> it said "you can't stop me"
<Mikey> that's...creepy
<Lambda> and I swear to God I am not pulling your leg
<Mikey> o_____o;
<Lambda> this really happened
<Neon> Nah, I believe you.
<Neon> Did you ask him?
<Lambda> when he signed in he said he had no clue what it was
<Lambda> he had sold his xbox and just now got it back
<Mikey> that's still really creepy
<Mikey> when did that happen?
<Neon> How long before was the message from when you talked?
<Lambda> so I was thinking the guy he sold it to must;ve just done that to a random friend
<Lambda> like an hour
<Kyu> 07lol
<Kyu> 07*not irl*
<Lambda> but I first got it the /instant/ he signed in
<Neon> I did stuff like that. xD
<Lambda> yeah we did too
<Neon> I'd be a schizo in people's parties.
<Soul> 14lol
<Neon> Yell at them for several minutes then calmly shoot the breeze.
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<Kyu> 07irl or not irl?
<Lambda> Mikey: it happened two years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid Google is decling my crediot card

<drfsupercenter> 03-o
<Mikey> oh ok
<Neon> So who answered when you called?
<Lambda> some lady from another state
*Light_Lati stifles a yawn

<Neon> xD
<Light_Lati> hai Roara~
<Lambda> actually I bet it was family issues
<Lambda> he hated his mom so much
<Kyu> 07LL wrote down the numbers are racked up 20 thousand dollars in fraudulent charges so they froze it

<LaptopAristeo> Stormy: How was work?
<Stormy> it was OK
<Stormy> pretty much the same thing I usually do only with no customers around to distract me
<LaptopAristeo> Oh, that's awesome
<LaptopAristeo> I saw something pretty neat at walmart the other day
<LaptopAristeo> I was in line in the 10 items or less line, and the line was kind of backed up because 1) the lady had like 30 items and 2) none of her cards were working
<Presea> heh
<LaptopAristeo> And she seemed like someone who was down on her luck
<LaptopAristeo> So, the person directly in front of me actually went up there and used her card and bought everything for the lady :3
<Stormy> Aww
*LaptopAristeo nods
<Stormy> That was nice of her :)
<LaptopAristeo> :)
*LaptopAristeo though so too

<Kipi> yip
<Arti|mobile> ra?
<Kipi> Hullo, Lady Arti
<Arti|mobile> what's wrong Kipi?
<Kipi> Just me bein' nervous is all.
<Arti|mobile> oh, what for?
<Kipi> In less than 40 minutes, I'll be drivin' to GCC for my first day in college
<Arti|mobile> woah...
<Kipi> Yeah
<Arti|mobile> that's big..
<Kipi> I've been thinkin' about it constantly for the past two weeks
<Kipi> Even last night, I had a dream that I overslept and missed all my classes. XP
<Arti|mobile> hey you still have us to turn to if you're feeling down while you're there but I'm sure you'll havw fun and make friends
<Arti|mobile> lol..
<Kipi> Down? Nay, it's mostly excitement, anticipation, 'n' nervousment
<Arti|mobile> oh good ^^ ish lol
<Kipi> But you know what they say, "the wait is worse than the moment"..
*Kipi hugs Arti
<Kipi> GCC's not that far, but I'm going an hour early to find a parking spot and find where all my classes are located.
<Arti|mobile> are you moving out then or just gonna travel each day?
<Kipi> I shall travel
<Arti|mobile> cool :>
<Kipi> :3 Transportation arrangments are kind of confusing though. I don't have(and don't want) my own car so I'll be using my Mom's on Mondays & Wednesdays. On Tuesdays and possibly Thursdays, I'll be takin' the bus. Friday... at this point is a mystery. Mom would be getting out of work early on that day so she has to have the car, but Friday is also the day I
<Kipi> need to go early.
<Arti|mobile> LOL
<Bloatedfish> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE

<ChinChilla> 14owo
<ChinChilla> 14Well, that first comment was curious.
<Sparky> 2OAo
<eXAKR> I guess my mind went bork at this
<eXAKR> But really
<eXAKR> Wars, devastation, genocide, militarism, and now this
<Sparky> 2oAo
<eXAKR> Sometimes I wonder if humanity's mission is to exterminate itselfg
<eXAKR> *itself
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't say it's the mission
<Aurora> 6but I'd say we're headed that way anyways
<eXAKR> Completely, in the slowest and most painful and horrendous manner possible
<eXAKR> Sigh
<eXAKR> Really
<eXAKR> I don't know what I can do, really
<eXAKR> The only way humanity is to wake up from this is when everything is utterly, completely devastated
<Aurora> 6pretty much
<eXAKR> Nuclear Winter, human extinction, complete destruction of Earth, etc.
<Aurora> 6but I can't say I've given up
<eXAKR> I'm giving up
<Aurora> 6there are people who, like you and me, understand what we're headed to
<ChinChilla> 14We've came close to striking 12 on the doomsday clock, but there's always something to rewind it.
<eXAKR> So what can we do
<Aurora> 6I have just given up for the blind ones, the ones who have vengeful souls, and the ones who live off another's pain
<Aurora> 6us? well
<Aurora> 6keep being us
<Aurora> 6because there's a good population of good people out there
<eXAKR> I really hope there are
<Aurora> 6I know there are
<ChinChilla> 14Oh, yeah. Rora?
<Aurora> 6otherwise we would have been destroyed LONG ago
<ChinChilla> 14I had a dream that I somehow accessed TST forums.
<ChinChilla> 14And yeah, no one was there. Owo
<eXAKR> True though, that.
*Aurora 6can access them, but that's beside the point
<eXAKR> 21 December 2012
<ChinChilla> 14Y2k.
<eXAKR> I sometimes secretly wish something really major does happen on that date
<eXAKR> Something to jolt humanity out of this madness
<Aurora> 6 12/21/12, I will be one of those people laughing
<Aurora> 6because I don't believe it
<eXAKR> I don't either
<Aurora> 6but what eXAKR said, I kinda hope so too...
<Aurora> 6it's sad :|
<eXAKR> But sometimes, I secretly do
<eXAKR> It doesn't have to be world ending
<ChinChilla> 14Sure, let a few stock markets crash.
<eXAKR> Just something global and devastating enough
<Aurora> 6in the first wars, we used sticks, in the second wars, we used guns, in the third wars, we used nuclear missles
<Sparky> 2o-o
<Aurora> 6in the fourth wars, we'll use sticks
<eXAKR> You know, in a part of Indonesia there was a civil war going on for YEARS
<ChinChilla> 14Replicating that alleged Einstein quote?
<eXAKR> Then the 2004 tsunami hit
<eXAKR> Suddenly, peace
<Sparky> 2o3o
<ChinChilla> 14The Koreas have been warring since... well, they never stopped since they divided, I think.
<Aurora> 6but you see, while I don't necessarily "accept" war....I accept war
<Sparky> 2gosh
<Aurora> 6I just wish there was another, less painful way of war
<Glacymr> 12chess tournament :D
<eXAKR> Those people realised that Mother Nature are better mass murderers than humans.
<ChinChilla> 14War really does nothing.
<Sparky> 2I have four one-shots that need proper writing instead of logs that I started spitting out entire stories of to Sheena
<Sparky> 2D:
<eXAKR> In war, only Death wins
<Aurora> 6but I think the brutality of it is what keeps us from REALLY messing things up
<eXAKR> Like nuclear bombs.
<Sparky> 2yeah
<Aurora> 6we CAN NOT all agree on something
<Aurora> 6it's that simple
<ChinChilla> 14You kill thousands of people, and it's only through discussions which peace is made.
<Aurora> 6there's 8 billion of us
<Aurora> 6it's not happeninhg
<Aurora> 6-h
<Sparky> 2o3o
<eXAKR> After the world saw what it did to the Japanese, people made thousands of them but dared not use them anymore
<Sparky> 2...
<Sparky> 2we did?
<Sparky> 2oAo
<Aurora> 6which, while it's scary
<ChinChilla> !define Paradigm
<[TST]Bot> -!- systematic arrangement of all the inflected forms of a word
<Aurora> 6I'm happy for
<Sparky> 2MAD
<eXAKR> We do not all need to agree
<Aurora> 6because that knowledge was bound to come at some time
<Aurora> 6so we used it at the best moment
<Aurora> 6and now everyone is scared
<eXAKR> What we all need to agree is that disagreements need not be settled with violence
<Sparky> 2o/) We don't have to become one, if we just accept one another~ o/)
<Aurora> 6I'm just scared of the one who decides "forget what happens to us, launch the missiles"
<Sparky> 2... oAo
<eXAKR> Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on that too
<Aurora> 6that face is just as annoying as o3o now

<eXAKR> ChinChilla, what.
*nintendofreak 12yawns
<eXAKR> I can only pray that those who are blind to anything but violence and hatred to open their eyes

<Sparky> 2._.
<drf|work> I'm all for saving power if it doesn't sacrifice performance
<Sparky> 2o3o
<drf|work> but with things like battery chargers, generally the more watts the faster they charge

<drf|work> um
<drf|work> sure
<Sparky> 2hmm
<drf|work> in this case yes
<Sparky> 2I wonder why
<drf|work> in the case of computers I mean performance
<drf|work> ...
<Sparky> 2o3o
<drf|work> it's not rocket science
<drf|work> think of it like this
<drf|work> picture a battery as a big water tower
<Sparky> 2[10:32am] <drf|work> but with things like battery chargers, generally the more watts the faster they charge <- Hmm, I wonder why ~*
<drf|work> picture the electricity as a hose
<Sparky> 2o3o
<drf|work> the more water you pour at once
<drf|work> the faster the tank fills up
<drf|work> right
<drf|work> so saving power would be like only running the water at half power, etc
<Sparky> 2picture drf missing the water tower and spraying the guy next door

<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Sparky> 2... OH
<Glacymr> 12apparently it's spelled with an extra i Aurora
<Sparky> 2Shimeji's are the mushrooms in pasta?
<Sparky> 2really? O_o
<Glacymr> !define shiitake
<[TST]Bot> -!- edible east Asian mushroom having a golden or dark brown to blackish cap and an inedible stipe
<Sparky> 2o3o
<Sparky> 2stipe?
<Aurora> !define stipe
<[TST]Bot> -!- supporting stalk or stem-like structure especially of a pistil or fern frond or supporting a mushroom cap
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Air> !define shimeji
<[TST]Bot> -!- Shimeji (, 占地) is a group of edible mushrooms native to East Asia. Hon-shimeji (Lyophyllum shimeji) is a mycorrhizal fungus and difficult to cultivate. Other species are saprotrophs, and buna-shimeji is now widely cultivated. ...
<Glacymr> 12apparently it's spelled both ways
<Aurora> 6I always called those stalks
<Glacymr> 12who would of figured
<Air> there.
<Sparky> 2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Auricularia_auricula-judae_Eglinton.JPG oh god, that's a Mushroom?
<Aurora> 6looks like a liver
<Glacymr> 12mmmmm
<Glacymr> 12tasty
<Air> also the other way is probably shītake. different way of interpreting th kana in romaji
<Sparky> 2o3o
<Glacymr> 12ok
<Air> though without special characters, shiitake or shi-take are the correct ways
<Sparky> 2or
<Sparky> 2we can just call it a mushroom
<Sparky> 2and be done with it o3o'''
<Aurora> 6just do this is said
<Aurora> 6*so
<Air> we can do that, though I was replying to <%Glacymr> apparently it's spelled both ways

<Ryft> also, Dari, if you're going to make fun of an alternate name of mine, pronounce it right
<RedDragonX> happened awhile ago
<Kjakings> 7also, there's a study which is creating kevlar that they can blend with wool and such, so that realistically, in the future, ALL CLOTHES ARE BULLETPROOF.
<Aurora> 6don't get me wrong, I like it just as much as the other one
<Aurora> 6but it just doesn't work D:

<Kjakings> 7you realise steel is already an alloy?
<Sparky> 2all I saw was Reborn XD
<Aurora> 6I still do whenever I read it
*Sparky 2giggles
<Vulcan> 14Titanium, Iron, Zinc, Copper, you name it.

<Sparky> 2Roara, that is EPIC
<Kjakings> 7Dixie Normous
<Aurora> 6anyways yeah
<Vulcan> 14Yes, Steel is an alloy...I know that already.
<Aurora> 6NEVER shall I complain about drawing suicune's tailribbons again
<Icydragon3D> 12Neotyguy40: Ice.
<Kjakings> 7either your mother had a c-section or is some kind of god

<Neotyguy40> 3You know, you can go to the bank and ask for $100 in pennies, melt it down, and sell it as scrap for $700-800
<Vulcan> 14Technically, I am a Titanium dragon, but since I have more metal in me, I am classified as a Metal dragon.
<Articuno> 12LOL OK
<Glacymr> 12?
<Prince-dari> What is it with religious people, and killing people virtually, or weapon obsessions? O_o
<Vulcan> 14Love the Vulcan Miniguns. <3

<Sneas> Class soon
<Armageddon> you're taking too long to come
<Prince-dari> I would probably call them awesome wall-mounted £500,000 14z0r beams of death, rather than 'pen lasers'. :P
<Kjakings> 7then don't be stupid
<Armageddon> :3
<Armageddon> D:
*Armageddon snugs Sneas
<Sneas> I hate late classes, this one last from 6:30pm to 9pm
<Aurora> 6seriously, if you see what I fixed (not added, fixed), you're saintly
<Armageddon> >:
<Sneas> lasts
<Neotyguy40> Wow, you don't need to be an asshole... Lighten up
<Kjakings> 7if only teh almighteh Th0ngz was here
<Drake> 04NS isn't that a GOOD thing?
<Aurora> 6updated
<Kjakings> 7he could out-laz0r all of us
<Articuno> 12Yeh I see
*Vulcan 14takes a small cube of Gold and manipulates it into a small Statuette of himself. ^.=.^
<Articuno> 12You know it's funny, you do exactly what I do
<Sneas> lolGB
<Armageddon> cum*
<Aurora> 6._.
<Armageddon> o.o
<Articuno> 12Upload something, look at it for a few mins then realise there's something wrong/missing
<Aurora> 6yup >_<;
<Articuno> 12and keep doing that till it's right XD
<Neotyguy40> Question: If you could have any weapon/device/item from ANY video game... What would it be?
*Prince-dari pawns it.
<Kjakings> 7how can you manipulate metal like that? it's not forging, for that you need heat. You can't just take a solid object and manipulate it like that
<Aurora> 6ok...
<nintendofreak> 12lol dari
<Icydragon3D> 12He's suppose to be perfect
<Aurora> 6 3rd update >_<;;;
<Neotyguy40> Alchemy...
<Neotyguy40> Acid?
<Neon> My friend's karate instructor is actually Master Bates.
<Kjakings> 7acid would just corrode it
<Sneas> lolWUT
<Articuno> 12LOL!!!
<Neotyguy40> Corroding is a type of manipulation...
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Armageddon> hai Aristeo :3
<Kjakings> 7if we're bringing alchemy into this I want to use my perpetual motion device
<Articuno> 12If it helps, I didn't notice anthing wrong the first few times :3
<Armageddon> it's like
<Armageddon> on cue
<Neotyguy40> Fair enough
<Aurora> 6I wanted to fix this like 10 minutes before I even finished
<Vulcan> 14My powers of that are like Alchemy...but not quite. I just bend the material structure of the element into the shape I want.
<Kjakings> 7yes, but it's not manipulating in this way
*Sneas cancome on cue :3
<Aurora> 6but I felt like it could stay
*Sneas hides and dies
<Ryft> xD
<Aurora> 6but I can't stand it anymore
<Prince-dari> Alchemy = turning stuff into gold, not manipulating its form.
<Neotyguy40> NANOBOTS!!!
<Vulcan> 14FMA is BS then.
<Prince-dari> FMA is?
<Aurora> 6THERE
<Kjakings> 7see, now that's Sueing. You give a half-assed explanation in answer to a power that defies even the liberal laws of physics of a world which includes dragons
<Vulcan> 14nevermind...
<Sparky> 2Roara
<Neotyguy40> Can't dragons have nanobots?
<Kjakings> 7 23:04	Neotyguy40	Question: If you could have any weapon/device/item from ANY video game... What would it be? the SSV Normandy SR2.
<Vulcan> 14Hey, Dragons are mythical...the physical being of in this world doesnt even make sence...but it exsists.
<Aurora> 6...
<Sparky> 2why do I feel like the ribbon is longer, adn that the grass was not there before?
<Aurora> 6oh what the heck
<Sparky> 2o-o
<Aurora> 6it didn't even update..
<Neotyguy40> I would choose the Toolgun from Garrysmod...
<Aurora> 6....OH WHAT THE HECK
<Aurora> 6IT DIDN'T EVEN SAVE LOL
<Kjakings> 7there was a guy in Chuck called Colonel Sanders.
<Sparky> 2... XD
<Glacymr> 12what's this talk about updates?
<Articuno> 12I thought there was no difference there..
<Kjakings> 7whoo! Gmod!
<Neotyguy40> I would be able to weld anything to anyone, spawn anything I want... Delete things...
<Aurora> 6yeah it updated, but I forgot to save so I essentially uploaded the same exact file
<Aurora> 6redoing
*Sneas killed chat :3
<Sparky> 2SHINY
<Sparky> 2 8D
<Aurora> 6that
<Aurora> 6should
<Aurora> 6do it
<Sparky> 2IT'S SHINYYYYYY
<Neotyguy40> My second choice would be the staff from Star Fox adventures...
<Kjakings> 7also, the toolgun is useless without the tools that go in it, which are seperate things. and it doesn't spawn things in the way you mean it besides things like thrusters. which you can't use, because they're seperate from the gun
<Neotyguy40> The toolgun is a single object
<Skylands> 10It's been killed for a while now :3
<Neotyguy40> Sure, it can't spawn things
<Kjakings> 7right. _Read_what_I_write_
<Neotyguy40> But all the tools are inside it, and that's good enough for me
<Sneas> :<
*Sneas bye :<
<Neotyguy40> When I said spawn, I mean ropes, wires, baloons...
<Kjakings> 7also, the toolgun is useless without the tools that go in it, which are seperate things. and it doesn't spawn things in the way you mean it besides things like thrusters. which you can't use, because they're seperate from the gun
<Kjakings> 7Read it over and over until you actually understand what it says
<Articuno> 12?
<Dragonite> 07o3o
<Neotyguy40> I understand
<Aurora> 6eh?
<Prince-dari> Is it even possible to get the toolgun without all the tools in anyway...?
<Neon> Haha.
<Neotyguy40> You misunderstood what I meant
<Neotyguy40> Exactly
<Neotyguy40> All the tools are in the toolgun
<Armageddon> o-o
<Armageddon> D:
<Armageddon> bye Sneas ;;
<Kjakings> 7No, but they're still seperate. He said one thing
<Neotyguy40> It's a single item
<Kjakings> 7stop being unhelpful dari
<Ripred> 2i hated the hotel i was staying at untill i saw the room number i was in .-.
<Neotyguy40> No, they're not separate
<Prince-dari> Ok. :P

*Vulcan 14yawns.
<Neotyguy40> Does it freakin matter?
<Neotyguy40> Seriously!
<Kjakings> 7nah but it's funny to see you snap
<Sparky> 2(2272 - 3)10 + (2692 - (3)2) = 249
<Sparky> 2WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Sparky> 2orz
<Prince-dari> Look at it this way, if you buy a TV box off ebay it doesn't mean it has a TV in it, you bought the box, not the TC.
<Prince-dari> They aren't one and the same.
<Glacymr> 12oh hi Dragonite :)

<Neotyguy40> Long string of text!
<Neotyguy40> Maybe I am... I may be a pedofork...
<Kjakings> 7 23:17	Prince-dari	We are the school project of an alien child. That would make that child creator of all things. Omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Therefore God
<Prince-dari> Well as long as you're not a pedospork.
<Sparky> 2... does it really take that long?
<Prince-dari> The creator of all things in our universe.
<Neotyguy40> If he was omniscient... Why would he be in school?

<Kjakings> 7they made an arcade version of that, and when my brother and I went to Centre Parcs we played it so much we disconnected the boost button
<Shadowabsol> 14Um... Green?
<Stormy> stuff
<Aurora> 6k
<Ryft> What kinda stuff? >:C
<Mikey> we're yelling at this n00b on another site
<Swaffy> 12Heheh.
<Mikey> :P
<Ryft> oh okay
<Mikey> shes giving us the old "IT'S MY OPINION!!!!!!!!!!!" excuse
<Swaffy> 12I used to play it at the arcades. Not it's on Xbox 360 LIVE.
<Kjakings> 7nice. we DID have Hydro thunder 3 I think it was for the PS1, but it appears to have vanished
<Kjakings> 7I was called racist a few weeks ago for telling someone to shut the fuck up
<Mikey> LMFAO
<Neotyguy40> 3I hate it when I can't find my old games
<Mikey> "YOU JUST HATE ME BECAUSE I'M BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
<Kjakings> 7that is the gist of it
<Dragonite> 07oihdiafhie
<Neotyguy40> 3I spent hours trying to find my Megaman legends game.
<Dragonite> 07when did Shadowabsol get here o3o
*Dragonite picks up
<Aurora> 6forever ago
*Dragonite hugs
<Dragonite> 07hai =3
<Icydragon3D> 12Has anyone else ever used cheat codes so much, that you end up knowing a shit load by heart?
<Neotyguy40> 3Umm
<Mikey> as for the sorens eye thing I think that they made his eyes yellow because if they were all black it might scare the shit out of some kids
<Neon> Kjakings: That's vehement racial profiling right there.
<Neotyguy40> 3What kind of stuff? The storyline?
<Neon> don't you love how the Censor Cat is away, and we mice play?
<Mikey> XDD
<Icydragon3D> 12What?
<Kjakings> 7the Censor Cat is gone?
<Sparky||HW> 2XD
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Damn straight.
<Kjakings> 7whooo!
<Neon> *Dammiy
<Neotyguy40> 3What kind of stuff are you talking about?
<Neotyguy40> 3WHat do you end up memorizing?
<Icydragon3D> 12Cheat codes,
<Swaffy> 12I used to memorize all of the GTA: San Andreas codes.
<Shadowabsol> 14I got here like, an hour ago. . . . Because I'm amazing like that.
<Kjakings> 7Icy: are you talking ones like number codes or punny words that have to do with the cheats?
<Dragonite> 07o3o
<Neotyguy40> 3I never used cheats in GTA
<Swaffy> 12The buttons.
<Icydragon3D> 12No, button combonations.
<Stormy> what?
<Kjakings> 7oh. then no
<Stormy> But icechat shows +G as on
<Stormy> o.O
<Ryft> Well
<Ryft> it isn't
<Kjakings> 7I can't do combos of any kind, except out of sheer button-mash luck
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Stormy> huh
<Stormy> weird
<Kjakings> 7you [censored]
<Quanyails> 7I've gotta stop instinctively checking my dA.
<Quanyails> 7Not until this art piece is done!
<Kjakings> 7anywho, it is now officially tommorow.
<Stormy> RedDragonX can set it back on if he wants to
<Kjakings> 7cya
<Neotyguy40> 3Try playing street fighter or SSB for a while
<Presea> rawr
<Kjakings> 7anywho, it is now officially tommorow.
<Icydragon3D> 12I guess I just have quick hands...
<Shadowabsol> 14I'm art procrastinating, too.
<Stormy> bye
<Kjakings> 7also, SSB has no combos.
<Neon> For though.
<Neon> Later.
<Neotyguy40> 3You will be able to play ANY game with combos
<Creideiki> Bon soir, carbon units.
<Neon> *thou
<Presea> NS why not just send a memo
<Presea> instead of using the topic
<RedDragonX> you play with my modes I'll go SR on you
<Stormy> D:
*Neon plays with his modes.
<Neon> xD
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> :P
<Neon> That sounds... quaint.
*Ryft plays with RDX's modes
<Neotyguy40> 3Does anyone even like Kjakings?
<nintendofreak> 12NO!
<Swaffy> 12Not at all.
<Swaffy> 12Neo, at least you're a bit nicer than he is.
<Neon> I'm so immature it makes me laugh.
<nintendofreak> 12I usually a stop talking while he's here or b use the ignore function on him
<Mikey> ^same
<Neotyguy40> 3I will take that as a compliment
<Neotyguy40> 3There's an ignore button!
<Neotyguy40> 3Where?
<nintendofreak> 12facepalm
<Icydragon3D> 12Yeah click the name then ignore.
<nintendofreak> 12click on someones name in the list then hit ingore
<Neotyguy40> 3Crap
<nintendofreak> 12lol
<Neon> Guys, here's a tongue tingler I thought of.
<Neotyguy40> 3That would've been useful...
<Mikey> "tongue tingler" LOL
<Neon> "Narcissistic Fibrosis."
<Aurora> 6this image is hurting my eyes lol
<Sparky||HW> 2XD
<Neon> I love the way that sounds.
<Swaffy> 12I hope no one ignored me. Or is ignoring me.
<nintendofreak> 12no
<EpicStatsGuy> HERE COMES THE LAG TRAIN
<nintendofreak> 12kjakings is the only person ive ever had to use it on although ruriks been close to it at times...
<Swaffy> 12Then I will feel hated ...

<Swaffy> 12http://ieatcrayons4.tripod.com/lg-bawls.jpg

<Icydragon3D> 12HAHAHAHA
<Presea> really the cpu is clocked at 2.6ghz
<Altair> lol
<Presea> and the bus is running at 1300mhz
<Neotyguy40> 3If I had a website, I would put a hotlink block on it too
<Altair> mine is the exact same
<Altair> @clock
<Neotyguy40> 3Get a couple thousand more views
<Presea> i have the cpu multiplyer Set lower
<Presea> it's at x6
<Presea> atm
<Presea> instead of x11
<Presea> techincally
<Presea> i'm not overclocking the BUS at all
<Presea> it can handle up to 1333mhz
<Presea> as this board is designed for qaud cores
<Dragonite> 07kbatteryrunninglowbai
<Presea> that need that bus speed
<Presea> i'm just using my boards power to it's fullest

<Neotyguy40> 3Spelling fail?
<Presea> i plan to increase my cpu speed up to 3ghz
<Neotyguy40> 3Or was it?
<Presea> as it worked out fine for about 2 months like that
<Presea> though the bus speed wasn't this high
<Neotyguy40> 3For all we know... deferbaderbs is a real word...
<Icy> 12bhvccfydreuyiuopio
<Neotyguy40> 3Syllable pronunciation failure...

<nintendofreak> 12he's normally online just not today
<Stitch> XD
<Icydragon> 12He died, along with the forum. <:L
<Neotyguy40> 3It's too bad he doesn't care about the forums...
<Neotyguy40> 3It wouldn't take much to get it more active. Just merge many of the topics together to condense the conversation more
<Neotyguy40> 3People would talk in it alot more often
<nintendofreak> 12pretty much the only thing that will wake it up is an announcement of a spyro game etc
<Corevette789> LOL
<Neotyguy40> 3Most of it isn't about Spyro anymore though
<Neotyguy40> 3 90% of the conversation is in the general chat
<nintendofreak> 12LOL http://www.epicfail.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/intelligence-fail-youtube-film-you-yahoo-answers.jpg
<Icydragon> 12And it's about Justin Bieber...
<Swaffy> 12Repost the link
<Icydragon> 12Link failed...

<Swaffy> 12b
<Presea> i played that before
<Presea> though it's not my kinda game
<Swaffy> 12You bet I'm back.
<Bloat3dfish> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11062708
<Neotyguy40> 3Wow, I suck at Torque...
<Glacymr> 12http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/silly-irc-user-posts-many-news-links-4893934
<Icydragon> 12People join everyday, yet we have so little members....
*Curly pokes in
<Neotyguy40> 3Because most don't realize it's inactive
<Proto> hi Curly
<Proto> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181169/1282602213542.jpg
<Proto> you missed it
<Neotyguy40> 3So they make an account and then disappear
<Icydragon> 12If only we had a successful reunion.... maybe...
<Curly> hey :)
<Mikey> CLAP YERRR HANDS
<Curly> I've seen that before ^^
<Proto> oh
<Proto> sorry
<Neotyguy40> 3I wish they would announce another game
<Neotyguy40> 3Maybe a fan-made game?
<Icydragon> 12Maybe...
<Swaffy> 12I've never heard of Torque. That, or it's just because I've never played it.
<Neotyguy40> 3Torque isn't a game. It's a game engine
<Neotyguy40> 3You make games with it. Like Gamebuilder, but more... Professional?
<Neotyguy40> 3Like the Source engine or the Unreal engine or the CryEngine
<Neotyguy40> 3Check it out:
<Neotyguy40> 3http://www.torquepowered.com/
<Soyuz> no
<Soyuz> Fallout 1
<Soyuz> the first, original game
<Neotyguy40> 3You know the game Tribes?
<Neotyguy40> 3The engine was based off of that game
<Soyuz> though I'm kinda a fan of Civs, Fallout, and Dawn of War
<Swaffy> 12Odd.
<Neotyguy40> 3I say I suck at it because I can't understand any of the code I'm reading
<Swaffy> 12I'll just stick to modding Battlefield 1942.
<Neotyguy40> 3Wow, 8 posts without interruption...
<Neotyguy40> 3It's basically the same
<Presea> ah
<Neotyguy40> 3Just you need to make your own assets and scripts

*Neotyguy40 3slaps IcyDragon3D
<Ryft> "Using spare parts from the warthog, we'll build a Griff cannon. Utilizing the power of the Griff cannon, we'll punch a Griff sized hole in the wall.... or paint it a really nasty color."

<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7You know, the project's expectations can swing one of two ways.
*IcySwaff 12likes things.
<Quanyails> 7Will peoples' hypes get raised so high their expectations are barely met? Or will people think this delay means the project is bad?
<Icydragon3D> 12IcySwaff...
<Icydragon3D> 12<.<
<Ripred> 2well im getting hyped so il end up disapointed

<Lambda> Hey guys
<Lambda> Oh hey Glace
<InfamousZed> starwars!
*Ryft stares at Glace
<Neon> Nope.
<Lambda> it's been a while since you've been here
<Ryft> o.o
<Neon> Keep guessing.
<InfamousZed> ive never seen her before
<InfamousZed> teletubies
<Lambda> ummm
<Neon> *Teletubbies
<Neon> ;)
<Lambda> she's RDX's girlfriend
<Lambda> Neon: was it... a Bionicle movie?
<InfamousZed> ah
<Neon> No, lol.
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> I know
<Lambda> Scott Pilgrim
<RedDragonX> heard it was a good movie
<Glace> o.o
<RedDragonX> is it true?
<Neon> No, no, much older than Scott Pilgrim.
<Lambda> it is
<Lambda> it truly is an epic of epic epicness
<Lambda> umm
<Glace> o.o me? older?
<InfamousZed> lol
<Lambda> XD no, the movie
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> ummm
<Lambda> errr
<Lambda> hint?
<Neon> The Idiot. :P
*Glace looks back to Ryft
<Lambda> :O
<Neon> That's the hint, not the answer.
<Lambda> You saw it!
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> The... Jerk!
<Neon> Yes.
<Neon> :P
<Lambda> :D
*Ryft stares...
<Neon> It was hysterical.
<Lambda> What did you think?
<Lambda> I agree
<Neon> I think the dialogue was perfect
<RedDragonX> well its either that or the Expandables
<Lambda> "One... two... three... fourfivesix!"
<Neon> I also saw The Expendables days ago.
<Neon> XD
*Glace bonks him upside the head "cease your staring child"
<Lambda> I love the part when the guy says the N word
<Neon> Yeah, yeah.
<Lambda> and he gets offended and goes all karate on him
<Neon> "You happen to be in the presence of a N!"
*Ryft D:
<Lambda> XD
*Ryft goes off and cries ;~;
<Neon> You know the jungle bunnies.
<Lambda> For those of you who haven't seen it
<Lambda> the guy is white
<Neon> Ah yes, they''ll eat the vegetables.
<Lambda> and he thinks he's black
*Glace sends a minion of peeps after him
<Lambda> "He hates these cans!"
<InfamousZed> holy crap! ryft is being attacked by marshmellows!
*Ryft eats ChanServ in his misery
<Neon> That was my favorite part
<Lambda> "Stay away from the cans!"
<Neon> Other than when he "doesn't need" all those things at the end.
<Lambda> XD I love how the guy decides to kill him
<Lambda> XDDD I love the "I do need this" part
<InfamousZed> what movie is this?
<Lambda> and the part with "Led by my faithful dog"
<Lambda> and he's dragging the dog
<Neon> "Navin. R. Johnson... sounds like a run-f-the-mill d ouche."
*Glace scoots to Ryft and pets him
<Neon> *run-of-the-mill
*Ryft myars
<Neon> I'm curious, does Navin mean naive or something?
<Neon> It sounds like it could.
<Lambda> probably does
*Glace huggles Ryft
<Neon> But yeah, the dog part was great also.
<Neon> And his "Special Purpose."
*Ryft squirm o.o
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> His special purpose
<Lambda> wasn't the dog's name "shit head" or something?
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Because he thought the dog was warning him of a fire so Naving ot everyone up, and there ended up being nothing.
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> He was going to name it "Ol' Lifesaver" but some guy said to call it "Shathead."

<LaptopAristeo> :o
<Lambda> he argued with his wife on the phone and the recording of it got out
<Glace> because he's rich and famous and ppl broad cast it?
<Lambda> like two weeks ago
<Neon> He's also evidently vehemntly racist, sexist, and thinks his ex-wife doesn't have a soul...
<Glace> it happens every day o.o *failed to see humor* maybe im mssing the punch line..
<Neon> But hey, he's human, right? xD
<Neon> *vehemently

<Shy> Alright, I feel the need to say this because so many people assume I am female... I am a /GUY/.
<Curly> hi shy who's a guy~
<Shy> :D
*Curly is kind of of the "guy unless your nick's obviously female or proven otherwise" >.>
<Curly> type of person*
<GrimmSpider> yay paperwork is done :D
<Shy> It took you that long GrimmSpider?
<GrimmSpider> yeah i slept a bit
<Shy> Ah lol :)
<Inokis> i assume everyone is a guy unless they tell me otherwise
<Shy> Ha, me too usually... But for some reason people like to assume I am a chick.
<Curly> well, I just think if someone has an obviously female nick then they want to be treated as a girl so whatever floats their boat
<GrimmSpider> lol
<Lambda> Hello
<Shy> Are you saying I have a female sounding nickname, Curly? x.x
<Kjakings> 7blah blah blah, Mister Freeman
<Curly> no, I said "obviously" :O
*Lambda stays mute
<Lambda> hey Kja
<Shy> Sure. Sure you did.
<Curly> as in like if you were nicked ... Catherine or whatever then I'd treat you as a girl. non-proper nouns like... Curly and CootieMonster and Shy are automatically male >.>
<GrimmSpider> i know a chick who likes to be called shy
<Kjakings> 7type 'ill' into the youtube search bar - one of the suggestions is 'illuminati killed michael jackson'
<Shy> Well then, thats good Curly! :)!
<Lambda> XD
<Shy> Lol ><
<Curly> I think Shy's a cute nick though, for a guy or a girl ^^
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> I need to test youtube anyway
<Lambda> my internet just got upgraded

<Kjakings> 7oh, family computer
*Curly has never giggled on the internet >.>
<Lambda> oh okay
<TheBlackKnight> the black knight always triumpohs!
<Kjakings> 7my theory is, in an alternate dimension Chuck Norris' face inhabited the same spatial dimensions as my computer. He sneezed a group of trans-universe micro-blackholes, one of which hit my computer and is slowly destroying it
<TheBlackKnight> yer arm's off
<TheBlackKnight> no it isn't
<TheBlackKnight> what's that then?
<Lambda> hahaaha
<TheBlackKnight> it's just a flesh wound
<TheBlackKnight> lol

<Lambda> the use of the word "spam" as it's used online comes from them

<Kjakings> 7what was the original one that that was paordying? o_O
<Kjakings> 7...parodying*
<Lambda> it's just parodying the trailer for that new facebook movie
<Lambda> called Social Networking I think
<Kjakings> 7.... a facebook movie? that's probably the only thing that surpasses a Justin Bieber movie in uselessness
<Lambda> yep
<Lambda> a movie about the guy who made it :/
<Kjakings> 7the youtube one looks more interesting
<Lambda> I agre
<Lambda> I would actually go see the youtube one
<Lambda> :P
<Kjakings> 7I /might/ go see the facebook one for the same kind of reasons people watch those shows which show surgery and shit like that
<Lambda> to make yourself feel grossed out?
<Kjakings> 7... no. why would anyone do that?
<Lambda> I dunno
<Kjakings> 7I would think some kind of morbid fascination
<Lambda> I never watch shows like that, so I dunno why people do
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> so like a guilty pleasure combined with curiosity?
<Kjakings> 7no. The Jerry Springer show is guilty pleasure. I would think this isn't even that. Just the ruins of a train wreck you slow down to gawk at
<Lambda> ahhh
<Lambda> like that
<Lambda> I see what you're saying now

<Kjakings> 7also, peeps, Vulcan is a pedofork.
<Deathbat> Ah, but I'm not always invincible.
<Vulcan> 14-.=.- am not....
<Kjakings> 7both of your 'mates' are 9 years old
<Vulcan> 14She never said! End of conversation.
<Deathbat> I'm surprised Icy isn't here.
<Deathbat> He'd be straight in with the whole pedofork thing XD
<Kjakings> 7I had Icy hunt down and stalk Ayumi
<Kjakings> 7*has run out of oreos and milk* *loses*
<Jesus> Phaha :D
<Deathbat> Hey what happened with the whole reunion failure?
<Kjakings> 7Chuck Norris imploded my computer
<Kjakings> 7brb
<Deathbat> I got bored of Icy. Then some noobs came on and talked about pointless crud for about an hour.
<Deathbat> Unfortunate.
<Lambda> Mikey: Some guy that I've known for like a month now on another channel thought I was a girl until now :/
*Jesus waves his hands
<Jesus> These aren't the users you're looking for..
<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> War of teh Starz
*Lambda is a fanboy
<Kjakings> 7some nublets complained at SR about me
<Mikey> LMFAO
<Deathbat> Lol.
<Kjakings> 7People always assume I'm a girl. It is the single most irritating thing ever
<Lambda> It sort of is
<Kjakings> 7besides misspelling my name
<Lambda> what about me is feminine? :/
<Mikey> kjakings idk how that's even possible
<Lambda> my name ending with an -a I suppose
<Lambda> and yours has "king" in it
<Mikey> no lambda it's the fact that you don't obsess over breasts
<Mikey> LOLjk
<Kjakings> 7also, according to Vulcan's most recent breach of international law, I'm racist :3
<Lambda> well...
<Lambda> you weren't on epic-chat a few months back then
<Lambda> :P
*Cynder7 6gets reminded of the "GTA involves shooting Things!"
<Deathbat> :O SHUN THE NONBELIEVER
<Deathbat> etc.
<Kjakings> 7Chicken breast is quite tasty
<Lambda> that or I'm just not vocal about that stuff
*Jesus 2
<Kjakings> 7I exorcised Vulcan yesterday. I burned a cross into his chest and had Icy reciting Psalm 41
<Lambda> :P
<Deathbat> ...why Icy?
<Vulcan> 14I'm not a Christian. I dont believe in stuff like that.
<Kjakings> 7he was the only other one on
<Deathbat> Fair enough.
<Kjakings> 7hush Vulcan. People /not/ in the FBI's 'people to watch' list are speaking
<Deathbat> But anywho, I am no longer stupid :D
<Vulcan> 14If you have to know, i'm Agnostic.
<Lambda> only 30 minutes now D:
*Lambda burns a CD
<Lambda> need something new to listen to while driving there
<Kjakings> 7psssh. Use an aperture technology blah blah incinerator
<Andres> http://roflrazzi.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/303231b6-7ce4-484e-8e08-26dfe71a3573.jpg
*Jesus is not a christian either
*Jesus is a Jew.
<Kjakings> 7of course Stacey
<Lambda> lol
<Jesus> Lambda, Go burn pkmn to a vm, and play THAT in your car
<Lambda> but that may cause a resonance cascade
<Cynder7> 6.
<Kjakings> 7I forget the full name
<Jesus> w/ voice cmds ;)
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Deathbat> But do A grades in English, biology and physics GCSEs make me stupid?
<Lambda> I would
<Lambda> but I dunno how
<Lambda> ;)
<Kjakings> 7Yes. why did you not get an A*?
*Vulcan 14cuddles Teh Cyndah
*Lambda looks for where he left his blank CDs
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Kjakings> 7PEDOFORK!
<Cynder7> 6PEDOKNIFE!
<Deathbat> Because I'm not quite at the A* stage yet, buttface.
<Deathbat> PEDOSPORK
<Kjakings> 7LINKING SPORKS!
<Vulcan> 14My god. -.=.- You cant do anything without being flagged for one fricking reason
<Cynder7> 6XD
<Deathbat> Have YOU ever taken any exams?
<Xeeshu> mhm
<Deathbat> Vulcan: I KNOW RIGHT.
<Kjakings> 7Vulcan: don't be a pedofork.
<Kjakings> 7Stacey: No. I've never done any exams in anything /ever/ *rolls eyes*
<Vulcan> 14How about you stop being a meathead? -.-
*Cynder7 6remembered the nikniL kraP
<Deathbat> Hilarious.
<Kjakings> 7you realise that most people's heads are made of meat?
<Andres> She left before I finished making pizza D:
<Cynder7> 6Permission to WTF
*Andres shall email her a slice anyways
*Lambda can't find it
<Lambda> :(
<Kjakings> 7except for that one Cylon *glares at Chanserv*
<Vulcan> 14mmhm, but not all are classified are meatheads...only the ones who dont use it right and waste their knowledge are meatheads.
<Deathbat> A simple well done would've been nice, but ok, I can do with getting bitched at for doing my best.
<Kjakings> 7C7, start taking screenshots of things for a new SCS. I COMMAND YE *lightning cracks*
*Jesus has an idea for a new in-car game
<Jesus> Pkmn w/ voice cmds
<Kjakings> 7Vulcan: surely the seduction of small children is a waste of knowledge? just go to aduro
<Kjakings> 7also, I walked into a chair eight hours ago and my toe is STILL BLEEDING. D<
*Stitch wants one! D:
<Vulcan> 14I use my knowledge wisely...it's not my fault everyone masks who they really are in this damn internet...
<Deathbat> HAHAHA.
<Deathbat> That wasn't aimed at you Vulcan by the way
<Stormy> Good morning
<Mikey> STORMY!!!!!!!
<Mikey> :D
<Stormy> :D
<Kjakings> 7yes. Having a 'fursona' isn't masking who you are. Though I suppose you 'reveal' more to everyone under the age of 12 eh?
<Kjakings> 7heya Breezy
<Vulcan> 14Nope...no one asks...
<Kjakings> 7... should breezy have three e's?

*Jesus likes GMail
<Lambda> o.o
<James> 4XD
<Lambda> Aristeo is transforming everyone
<Kjakings> 7seriously. go back over the past SCS. I bet you at least two thirds of it involves Kja in some way
<James> 4Yes,you usually tend to be the star of every SCS XD
<Deathbat> ...

<Deathbat> o_O
<Kjakings> 7.... wasn't Cynder8 a cylon?
<Neon> Sh.
<louve> so we're just checking out the fellow communities and hoping for good conversations to come out of them
<Cynder7> 6Well,that hasn't been brought up for some years..
<Neon> In this case it's a typo.
<Xeeshu> Jesus: and Andres ??
<Shadowsfall> This is an interesting channel?
<Prince-dari> /nick God
<Kjakings> 7this has never been interesting
<louve> It's active enough to join
<Stormy> wait
<Jesus> idk yes
<God> Jesus, I AM YOUR FATHER!
<Jesus> :)
<Cynder7> 6Lol @ Dari.
<Xeeshu> lol
<Mikey> hi neon
<louve> better than a dead channel
<Neon> Jesus, daddy's home.
<nintendofreak> 12Xd dari
<Stormy> does everyone else see 2 Stormys in this channel?
<God> [20:25] * Prince-dari is now known as God
<God> [20:25] <Jesus> idk yes
<God> [20:25] <God> Jesus, I AM YOUR FATHER!
<God> [20:25] <Jesus> :)
<Kjakings> 7XD

<Neon> Huh?
<Kjakings> 7I remember when I kept joining as God and Death
<louve> and no
<louve> only one
<Neon> I'm in a drunken stupor right now.
<Stormy> O.o
<God> /nick Prince-dari
<Cynder7> 6Same
<Andres> Aww, I don't want to go Heaven :/
<Mikey> just one
<Stormy> Icechat glitched on me then
<Stormy> probably where the error is coming from
<Andres> It sounds boring and full of goody two-shoes D:
*Neon drops from the sky.
*Andres would prefer living forever and making this world burn!
*Stormy waves to Glace
<Mikey> hi
*Glace gives Stormy a cookie :3
<Prince-dari> Neon: I was doing that so I could say "Jesus, I AM YOUR FATHER!" to someone with Jesus as their nick,
<Neon> Lol, on this other chat I'm in, a guy screwed up his iden the other day.
<Neon> Forgot the slash and posted his pass for all to see. xD
<Mikey> lol
<Neon> Funny thing is, he was the admin.
<Prince-dari> Oh, Jesus is on here too, hey Jesus
<Stormy> I've done that twice
<Stormy> both in spyrochat
<Mikey> lol
<Neon> Oh, wow. xD
<Glace> Mikey: hi
<Prince-dari> First time BF ghosted you. XDDDD
<Deathbat> We all love Jesus
<Glace> o.o well that's smart x3
<Deathbat> And hey Dari
<Prince-dari> Hey.
<Shadowsfall> Everyone loves Jesus
<Neon> I remember joining as TheNarrator.
*Xeeshu would not allow Andres do that to the world..!
<Shadowsfall> but does Jesus Love Us?
<Deathbat> YES HE DOES.
<Neon> Whatever happened to BF, anyway?
<Cynder7> 6And that is the question.
<Stormy> Oh yeah, I remember that
<Cynder7> 6Wtf peoples!
<Stormy> BlueFusion is still around
<Stormy> He just doesn't come to spyrochat anymore
<Stormy> Probably because SR hates him
<Prince-dari> Haha
<Neon> Haven't seen it. :P
<Shadowsfall> Then may i ask about the seven signs of revelation?
<Neon> I call him it.
<Andres> Why? :/
<Prince-dari> Why is Things not here.
<Neon> *seals
<Deathbat> Not sure what they are exactly, I'll get back to you on that one
<Prince-dari> I want THE ALMIGHTY THONGS!
<Stormy> XD
<Neon> I know them, lol.
*Xeeshu can only allow Andres to kill Time.. :P
<Neon> Hahahaha.
<Deathbat> That's nice :)
<Shadowsfall> Can you name the four horses

*Inokis waves back
<Kitten> how is everyone today?
<Neon> LOl
<Inokis> sad and emotionally drained :sigh:
*Andres waves too!
<Kjakings> 7http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/b8588edf-55ea-4d41-8fd3-c7083d75c660.jpg
*Andres had delicious pizza somewhen!
*Kitten huggles Inokis
<Neon> Kjakings: They are clones of each other. Of course they're exactly the same height.
<Andres> Both of them?
<Andres> Wait, never mind XD
<Neon> :P
*Andres had scrolled up and the bottommost line was [22:52:40] <+Xeeshu> Andres: send the link again
*Inokis hugs back
<Inokis> ty
<Kjakings> 7they're not clones of each other. That would cause degredation of their DNA and make them fall apart. They're all clones of the same DNA sample Jango Fett gave them
<Kjakings> 7http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/0c114f39-8432-4c8a-8690-0eb6f882b281.jpg
<Kitten> lol Andres
<Neon> If you look into it, the science of Star Wars is pretty crappy.
<Neon> They're supposed to be the exact same gentic code.
<Neon> *genetic
<Kjakings> 7right
<Kitten> Inokis, mp, and if you need someone to talk to i'm always willing to listen :)
<Neon> I mean, you can even hear explosions and other sounds in space.
<Neon> Hahaha.
<Kjakings> 7you can't perfectly clone something. The perfect cloning process multiplies something by 2. The Kaminean process multiplies it by 1.999999, so eventually if they cloned clones they'd begin falling apart. They nipped that in the bud by keeping a hold on the sample Jango Fett gave them
<Kjakings> 7that's why the Asgard died out in Stargate. They didn't think to keep a hold of their original bodies.
<Neon> Right.
<Neon> I actually remember them, they were pretty awesome.
<Neon> Thor's Hammer, lol.
<Kjakings> 7Thor kicked ass
<Kjakings> 7http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/7dd3d89c-96ea-4e42-afba-a5285fe2784a.jpg
<Neon> Have you followed Universe at all?
<Prince-dari> I've been.
<Neon> I watched the first three. I have the rest on Netflix.
<Kjakings> 7no. It's only marginally better than Infinity.
<Neon> Well, can we all agree Atlantis was vomit?
<Kjakings> 7The X-304s were designed to take down Orri ships. EVIL ancients with ships designed around giant l4z0rz. before that, they were X-303s which were deisgned to take down Goa'Uld ships. In the first episode, the Lucian alliance manages to slip past an X-304 using old run-down Goa'Uld ships. What?
<Kjakings> 7and Atlantis was alright until they got rid of Weir
<Prince-dari> I stopped watching just before they killed her.
<Kjakings> 7Sam did not fit in with Atlantis
<Prince-dari> SG1 FTW anyway.
<Kjakings> 7they probably got the best person in the guy who plays the Doctor from Voyager
<Kjakings> 7which reminds me, it was awesome when they did that little shout-out to the Doctor in Doctor Who
<Prince-dari> ?
<Prince-dari> When was that?
<Kjakings> 7in that one where he lives in that flat, when the emergency hologram appears The Doctor says "I am the Doctor. Please state the nature of the emergency."
<Prince-dari> Oh, lol.
<Prince-dari> New doctor...Blehh
<Kjakings> 7yeah. Tennant was the best Doctor
<Kjakings> 7they're doing a Dr. Who movie and apparently Johnny Depp is gunna be the new Doctor
<Prince-dari> New writer, good, but some of the things, vomit. First episode, praying to 'Santa', really...? >_>

*Kitten is precious?
*NightHawk blow drys Kitten

<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: very precious :)
*LaptopAristeo had a very eventful drive home
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: Did I tell you about it? :o
<LaptopAristeo> I avoided an accident
<LaptopAristeo> Someone pulled out in front of me going like 5 MPH and I was going like 62 MPH
<Kitten> oooooh! should've run the person over *nods*
<LaptopAristeo> And .... well.. my brakes work >.>
<Kitten> you better have been wearing your seat belt!
<LaptopAristeo> And so I went to the gas station to get something to drink, and as I was leaving, an older man asked me if I know how to get to a certain place 10 minutes in the other direction
<LaptopAristeo> Kitten: I was, but my cell phone wasn't on the seat next to me
<LaptopAristeo> Slammed my cell phone into the dash board
<LaptopAristeo> >.<
<Kitten> did it break?
<LaptopAristeo> Don't think so
<LaptopAristeo> But anyway!
*Kitten giggles
<LaptopAristeo> Someone asked if they could take me up to place in the other direction that I just came from
<LaptopAristeo> And being the big softy I was, I said sure, and let him in
<LaptopAristeo> And I drove him up 10 minutes in the other direction to a bar he wanted to go to >.>
<Kitten> you shouldnt do things like that
<LaptopAristeo> I know :(
<LaptopAristeo> But I'm a big softy
<Kitten> he could've had a gun or a knife and took your head!
<LaptopAristeo> D:
<Kitten> then i'd be without an aniki *cries*
*LaptopAristeo wants to help people :(
<LaptopAristeo> And I took him up there and he was like "how much do you want for that?" and I was like "it's fine, it's on me"
<Kitten> and possibly lose your life :(
<LaptopAristeo> I sowwies
<LaptopAristeo> He looked like a guy low on his luck though, and he said that he owned a plumbing business a while back, but he had to quit it to take care of his mother, who broke her back :(
<Kitten> and now he's spending all his money at a bar?!
<LaptopAristeo> Nuh uh
*NightHawk smacks LaptopAristeo
<LaptopAristeo> He didn't have but like a few dollars on him
<LaptopAristeo> He can't get a drink with that
<LaptopAristeo> He just wanted to get out of the house and chat with people
<NightHawk> people use people LaptopAristeo
<NightHawk> so he more likely use the women
<LaptopAristeo> :(
<LaptopAristeo> He was a good guy :(
<LaptopAristeo> And told me that he didn't regret a thing, because if there was one thing in this life that's important, it's your family
<Kitten> i'll give him the benefit of the doubt
<LaptopAristeo> He just needed some fresh air
<Kitten> just be more careful Ari
<LaptopAristeo> I don't know, it made me feel good doing something nice for someone else :)
<Neon> I AM MAN
<Neon> HEAR ME RAWR
<LaptopAristeo> Because, I mean, if we can't help other people, if we don't leave a positive impression in the lives of the people we influence, what else is there?
*Kitten bites Ari
<LaptopAristeo> I know, I know, it's unsafe, but I ... I just want to help people :(
<Kitten> don't go all presidential on me mister

<NightHawk> good he needs some guidence

<Neon> Woah...
<Neon> She still talks to RL, he says. But infrequently.
<Mikey> I havent talked to her in at least a year
<Mikey> I disabled getting her updates on facebook because I was sick of her putting her status as the lyrics to bulletproof

<Neon> Wow, his sense of humor seems to have evaporated.
<NPL> he asked "Lady Gaga FTW?"
<Neon> XD

<Neon> There was this little motivational sticker for staying above the influence, and scribbled on top of it was "I'm so high rite now."
<Mikey> LOL
<Edina> XDD
<Neon> I took that as a witty statement, since high is to above.
<Edina> though they probably didn't have that in mind
<InfamousZed> Stay above the influence... Stay high
<Neon> No.
<Neon> They had molten unicorns on the mind.
<Mikey> roll the windows down let the smoke get thicker~
<InfamousZed> you know what they say... where theres smoke... they pinch back...
<Neon> They say that?
<Neon> I never heard them.
<Edina> only you can prevent forest fires
<InfamousZed> that used to be the standard youtube poop intro
<Neon> "Only you can douse forest fires via urination... though being male may help."
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> XD
<Edina> LOL
<Neon> That is quoted, but it is original as of ten seconds ago.

<Lambda> at first though it was me who was thinking it was bad
<Lambda> you had high hopes for it at first
<Neon> It hasn't seemed to change anything.
<InfamousZed> you got paid a little more for doing nights didnt you?
<Stormy_> I'm not sure
<InfamousZed> :\
<Stormy_> Lambda says it's only $0.25
<Stormy_> per hour
<InfamousZed> hmm
<Lambda> what's the differential for you Infamous?
<InfamousZed> dont know
<InfamousZed> new people that started getting hired started out with more than i made when i started
<InfamousZed> dont you two have like a week left now?

<Lambda> we can be together again
<Stormy_> we move in
<InfamousZed> the world ends...
<Lambda> in school
<Neon> Oh, right.
<Lambda> XD at all the different answers
<Lambda> in the order
<Neon> For some reason I thought you were already there.
<Lambda> Be together -> School -> end of world
<Stormy_> O.o
<InfamousZed> crap... i forgot to do my classes..
<Neon> Oh, there's new development in the Rick Roll bid topic.
<Neon> They asked for what to type in to find the video, so I gave them all of these ridiculous tags to search.
<Stormy_> My supervisor probably thinks I left
<Stormy_> XD
<Neon> People still think there's a PG-13 trailer.
<Stormy_> the other three college age remodel workers left last Friday
<Edina> really? I was losing faith in their gullibility.
<Neon> One of the tags was "hail the fuhrer."
<Neon> And they still believed that, evidently. Except Fleur.
<Mikey> I must be gullible too, there wasn't a trailer that said "some blood and frightening images"?
<Lambda> Stormy's the last young white employee during her shift now
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> xD Do you have any green people on the shift?
<Stormy_> Well except Tom
<Stormy_> But he's not a store employee
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> Why are you green?
<InfamousZed> i'm the youngest still in my store...
<Stormy_> I'm not green
<Lambda> InfamousZed: at my walmart someone younger than me joined right before I left
<Edina> Neon: Well one other person replied
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy_> :(
<InfamousZed> i think there is one person on my shift that has the last name greene
<Lambda> Stormy: not you
<Lambda> was directed at your coworkers
<Neon> Wait... Stormy's not green? D: That just shattered my universe.
<InfamousZed> stormy has green hair
<Mikey> go green the right way
<Lambda> XD she does not
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy_> Yeah
<InfamousZed> and wears a chainmail bra
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Even Elmo is green these days.
<Stormy_> I actually have pink hair
<Stormy_> And flourescent orange skin
*Lambda can't imagine Stormy with hair those colors
*Neon has lost all feeling in his pinky for some reason.
<Neon> xD
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> Do not get the california skin
<Lambda> please
<Stormy_> XDD
<InfamousZed> have lighter hair than your skin
<Neon> Well, if she had green hair and orange skin she could be an Oompa Loompa.
<Lambda> the spray on stuff that makes people look like carrots
<Neon> But that's not the case.
<Mikey> LOL
<Lambda> InfamousZed: No I hate that!
<Lambda> Neon: oh yeah
<Stormy_> Maybe I should dye my hair blue
<Lambda> Lighter hair than skin
<Lambda> ew
<Stormy_> Like that Scott Pilgrim girl
<Stormy_> :P
<InfamousZed> lol i remember someone that did that on my shift
<Lambda> Stormy: she changes her hair color every week and a half actually

<Stormy_> :P
<Lambda> nah
<Lambda> but I read about the comics
<InfamousZed> lambda read the book
<InfamousZed> whoa
<Neon> I still haven't seen it. I became disillusioned after seeing the trailer.
<Neon> And I'm sure it couldn't beat The Other Guys.
<Lambda> and I hear that it follows the comics really closely
<Neon> That was too well done.
<Lambda> Neon: I still think it looks amazing
<Lambda> I can't wait to see it
<Neon> I'm not sure I will se tis moveh.
<Neon> *tihs
*Lambda is taking Stormy to it
<Lambda> if she agrees that is
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> If not, you have rope.
<Stormy_> D:
<Lambda> wait what?
*Lambda is not that kind of boyfriend
<InfamousZed> lambda dont do it! its a trap!
<Lambda> despite what InfamousZed says
<Neon> Dude, you don't even take her hostage? Talk about bad communication in a relationship.
<InfamousZed> chicks like being abducted... i mean its almost a cliche!
<Edina> I prefer tying my men up.
<Neon> Then you have women such as Princess Peach who are just hopelessly peril-stricken.
<InfamousZed> holy crap! someone that is openly into S&M
<Neon> XD
<Spyrorocks[ipad]> Ok it should be working now....

*Neon pulls a dagger out of #draconicwolves's back, dripping with IRC blood.
<Spyrorocks[ipad]> Now I can op easy on the go as well as on my phone.
<Edina> Edina pulls out pleather whips
<InfamousZed> holy shit pleather whips!
*Neon wonders what kind of bizarre direction this has taken.
<InfamousZed> plenty of pleather will please the plight politely
<LaptopAristeo> Haha
<Neon> Pleather whips have been known to plant plexiglass parishes.
<InfamousZed> its all edina's fetish's fault
*Neon nods sagely.
<Lambda> this channel should be renamed SAndMCorner
<Lambda> with the direction it just took at least
<InfamousZed> is that why you come here all the time?
<Neon> SaM's Corner.
<Lambda> no it isn't Infamous :P
<InfamousZed> lol SaM's club! lol
<Lambda> Hahaha!
<Lambda> WaltonLand
<Neon> Wally World.
<InfamousZed> welcome to SaM's club *cracks whip* have a nice day...!

<Lambda> but most of it is gone already

<Neon> It's still hot here. :/
<Lambda> and now it's actually cold
*Lambda has his windows open

<Edina> It's stormy here.
<Neon> I've had my millions of fans going.\
<Neon> And cheering me on.

<Neon> :P
<Edina> LMFAO

<Stormy_> OK guys
<Lambda> unless Edina lives there
<Lambda> Hm?
<Stormy_> If you care about what's happening with the merge
<Lambda> in which case come back to your part of it
<Lambda> oooh
<Stormy_> You might want to read this
<Neon> LOL Edina. I like that apporach to the pill dilemma.
<Stormy_> http://lists.epic-chat.net/pipermail/epic-chat/2010-August/000047.html
*Lambda pays attention
*Neon merges about what happens with the care.
<Stormy_> And everyone here is welcome to join #open-staff to share your opinions
<Edina> Neon: thanks
<Neon> Lol, Sr pretends not to recognize me.
<Neon> That's rich.
<Neon> *SR
<Edina> ?
<Stormy_> fail
<Neon> Nothing, on another chan.
<Stormy_> there's no way he couldn't recognize you
<Stormy_> you were there every day
<Stormy_> =/
<Neon> xD I know.
<Lambda> how the hell did he not know who Neon was?
<Neon> It's fine. I don't want to start trouble.
<Stormy_> Me either
<InfamousZed> i want to!
<Lambda> me neither
<InfamousZed> wheres the bloody bugger at
<Neon> I mean I do, but I can be mature sometimes.
<Lambda> but it still shocks me
<Neon> Lambda: The first thing I said was "This merge is outrageous and unconstitutional I object!" in all caps.
<Stormy_> [23:17] <Spyrorocks[ipad]> Who is neon anyways
<Stormy_> [23:17] <Spyrorocks[ipad]> From my forum or what?
<Mikey> ...lol at SR going "yo"
<Lambda> XD
<InfamousZed> wait.... sr on an ipad?
<Stormy_> failfailfail
<Stormy_> I know right
<Lambda> InfamousZed: INORITE
<Neon> He's trying to look cool among the bigwigs. :P
<Lambda> hahaha
<InfamousZed> i be rollin.. they hatin...
<Neon> Yes, his sense of humor hasn't dried up quite yet.
<InfamousZed> tryin to catch me ridin dirty
<Neon> *trollin'
<Neon> "They catch me trollin'... they hatin'..."
<Lambda> *White and Nerdy
<Stormy_> they think he's just too white and nerdy
<Stormy_> Oi, you stole my line
<Stormy_> D:
<Lambda> they see me mowin'
<Lambda> mah front lawn
<Neon> I take things to the extreme, whiter than sour cream...
<Lambda> but you know they're all thinkin' I'm just too white and nerdy
<Lambda> I know javascript as well as clingon
<Neon> I know all the words to my favorite theme songs, I dazzle you in a game of ping pong.
<Lambda> the only question I ever thought was hard was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard
<Lambda> Aristeo will get that one
<Edina> I can recite it right now and have you R-O-T-F-L-O-L
<Neon> So... I'm curious. What kind of community is Darc-hood? Is it affiliated with a forum like us?
<Lambda> darchood is a network
<Stormy_> epic-chat isn't affiliated with a forum
<Lambda> we are a channel
<Mikey> neon means does it go with a site like spyrochat goes to spyroforum
<Neon> I'm aware it's a channel, lol.
<Stormy_> darchoods is an entire network
<Lambda> or at least the part of us that's associated with a forum is a channel
<Neon> And when I say us, I mean #draconicwolves.
<Stormy_> They don't have a forum either
<Stormy_> But they have several channels that are affiliated with forums
<Lambda> well darchood isn't exactly correspondent to draconicwolves
*Neon nods.
<Neon> I never said it was.
<Neon> I'm so misread all the time, haha.
<Stormy_> You guys made SR start ranting
<Stormy_> D:
*Lambda is innocent
<InfamousZed> ha
<Stormy_> Someone press his off button
<Stormy_> :P
*Lambda should interrupt to suggest a network name
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> He's not bothering me like I thought he'd be.
<Neon> I just feel like a pleibian.
<Lambda> "So yeah anyway I think our network should be named LambdaLand"
<Mikey> LOL
<Neon> Haha.
<Mikey> it sound be darc-chat or something
<Lambda> I agree Mikey
<Stormy_> His presence always makes things slightly more awkward for me, I dunno =/
<Neon> No! It'll be called Neonarnia!
<Stormy_> Yeah, we were going to name it darc-chat
<Mikey> stormy same
<Lambda> it just makes me slightly more annoyed
<Lambda> but also awkward
<InfamousZed> name it the darcstormychat
<Stormy_> that was the name most of us agreed on
<Lambda> darcstormychat?
<Lambda> :P
<Edina> Name it SaM's Club
<Mikey> name it linking park
<Neon> I think it should be #darconicwolves. That way we only have to change two letetrs around.
<Lambda> Name it Walmart!
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> /shot
<Neon> *letters
<Stormy_> No thanks
<Stormy_> D:
<Mikey> omg infa z shut the fuck up in there lol

<Mikey> well dont
<Stormy_> He can
<Lambda> oh he can
<Neon> LOL I come back to a soliloquoy from SR about GPS.

<Stormy_> XD
<Mikey> this is one of the reasons you annoy me over half the time your on
<Lambda> Neon: XD
<Mikey> your so fuckin boring
<Lambda> hahahaha
<Stormy_> everyone shh
<Lambda> InfamousZed: I don't think you;re boring
<Stormy_> See how long he'll monologue

<InfamousZed> i wana see if he can carry a conversation withoutme
<Lambda> yeah exactly
<Lambda> XD

<Neon> Ha, he ignores it of course.
<InfamousZed> lol
<Mikey> brb
<Lambda> maybe he hasn't forgotten you after all then
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> he knows you're never serious
<Neon> I find it hard to believe that he did.
<Neon> I think he was just pretending not to know me because I embarassed him when I entered.
<Stormy_> I seriously doubt it
<Lambda> Neon: Do you still go to SC?
<Neon> Mhm.
<Stormy_> He doesn't ask "who is this" to every other "new" person he sees
<Neon> XD
<Lambda> oh nevermind then
<Neon> I'm not on right now, but I'm there most days that I'm here.
<Lambda> if you didn't I was going to say that he was just complaining about how many people he's lost
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> Which is basically eveyr day.
<InfamousZed> neon i need an ally oop! my apple knowledge has faded and i need jeerz
<Lambda> "Is he from my forum or something?"
<Neon> Dude, I'm trying to seem tech inept.
<Neon> I can't help you.
<InfamousZed> argue with him that you can talk into it like a webcam
<Lambda> hahaaha
<Lambda> isn't the next iTouch able to do that?
<Lambda> or was it something else?
<Neon> Look ar what I wrote.

<Rose[iPod]> There... fixed that again. >.<
<Andres> Hai :o
<Rose[iPod]> Hello there.
<Inokis> a rose by any other name just isn't the same
<Neon> Welcome back.
<Andres> Kitten! :D
*Andres gently paws Kitten!
<Inokis> shes supposed to be asleep
<Rose[iPod]> O.o
<Andres> D:
<Andres> Awww

<Andres> I'm going to go play something D: Sorry
<Andres> Bai!
<Inokis> what are you gonna play
*where is really getting tired of not being able to connect to this network :/
*where pokes Aristeo and LaptopAristeo
<where> D:
<where> make it better please D:
<LK-> What error, did it give?
<where> connection refused.
<LK-> What port?
<where> And I just change ports
<where> And eventually it works
<where> Even though it originally refused a connection on this port
<LK-> Which port?
<where> I'm on 6667 right now
<LK-> and what port were you using?
<where> 6668
<where> and 6666
<where> and they also work
<where> sometimes
<where> I used them before with no issues
<where> 6668 by default
<LK-> 6667 is for No-SSL and SSL is 6697
<where> rite
<where> That is
<where> What?
<LK-> Are you using SSL?
<where> I don't know
<LK-> anyway, 6667 is the standard port :P
<where> See, I'm on 6667 now, but if I tried to connect on it to begin with, it'd refuse the connection, then I'd try 6668, 6666, then 6667 again, and it might work, if not keep switching, and one of them will work randomly

<Andres> Hai!
<Rose> Aww
<Rose> Inokis: What's wrong, hun?
<Rose> hello there Andres
<Inokis> just going through a bad relationship issue having a hard time coping with the end
<Neon> Hey.
<Rose> Need me to beat anyone up for you?
<Inokis> no i just need to talk to ppl have a distraction etc
*Rose babbles on like an idiot.
<Rose> That help any? :P
<Neon> We already /played/ bable like an idiot.
<Neon> *babble
<Rose> Oh.
<Rose> Hmm....
<Inokis> lol
*Rose tries to come up with something distracting.
<Inokis> silliness
*Andres sings FMLYHM
<Inokis> i love that song
<Neon> Inokis: Have you ever been in space?
<Inokis> no ive always wanted to so much
<Rose> Inokis: you say silliness as if its a bad thing, sir
<Inokis> no its not
<Neon> Okay, next question.
<Neon> Has space ever been in you?
<Inokis> its not bad at all
<Rose> what's your favorite color?
<Inokis> yes im full of space, between cells, betwean atoms etc
<Neon> Correct.
<Inokis> sometimes green sometimes blue, partial to earthen colors
<Neon> However, I'm talking space as in a vaccuum.
<Neon> Not one that you clean carpets with.
<Inokis> before my existence i was vaccuus
<Rose> Yes, there is a giant vacuum inside all men. It's called their stomach.
<Neon> xD
<Neon> Nice.
<Inokis> indeed mine feels like a pit atm
<Neon> Wait, your stomach feels like your armpit?
<Andres> Is it true you like my curls? :o
<Neon> :P
<Inokis> not my armpit
<Inokis> just a pit of emptiness
<Inokis> like a knot
<Inokis> twined tight
<Neon> I'm only kidding.
<Inokis> i haven't seen ur curls
<Andres> It feels like a black hole that needs more cows, Bill.
<Inokis> indeed
<Inokis> mooo
<Neon> Or more cowbell.
<Inokis> lol
<Andres> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk1kPD3Gsw
<Neon> So, how may we be of a sufficient distraction to you?
<Inokis> ur doing fine
<Neon> What if stop entirely? What then? :o
<Inokis> then i sit here and continue trying to cope on my own
<Inokis> its easier with others
<Neon> [insert further questioning here]
<Inokis> ask anything you wish
<Neon> Okay. How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
<Inokis> 3 if ur an owl
<Neon> Hm... how about a turtle?
<Inokis> probably the same hes got a beak just takes longer cuz his lick takes like a year
<Rose> I want a pet turtle/
*Neon nods.
<Neon> Turtles are pretty cool.
<Inokis> ive always wanted a parrot but now its too late cuz they live like 80 years
<Neon> You could always take one that's already middle-aged from a pirate or something.
<Neon> Although he might have some serious language.
<Inokis> true but normally they have been abused and neglected and can't trust or cope and they are already stress prone they need stability
<Neon> Right, so you trap it in a laundry basket and don't feed them for four days.
<Inokis> not good
<Neon> [/sarcasm], Inokis.
<Inokis> i know
<Inokis> just be ur goofy self i understan
<Neon> I suppose.
<Inokis> lol
<Inokis> i wonder where the whole pirate/parrot thing started from
<Neon> Probably because there were parrots on all the tropical islands that pirates stopped at.
<Inokis> sort of like how the modern notion of hell was invented in middle ages
<Neon> So eventually one infamous one had a parrot as a pet, and it caught on.
<Inokis> probably but i wonder what literature specifically or lore made it a common stereotype
<Neon> Me too. It's more than likely not known. Or maybe Hollywood cooked it up.
<Kjakings> 7GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY OFFICE
<Neon> He says he doesn't like you.
<Neon> I, don't like you either.
<Kjakings> 7I did set his face on fire
<Neon> That would explain the falling shadows.
<Kjakings> 7nah, some douche put tripwires up everywhere
<Neon> A trap set for something four times as heavy as us...
<Neon> This was a last stand.
<Kjakings> 7no, this was a stag party
<Inokis> im googling trying to find citations
<Neon> No, this is Sparta.
<Inokis> just ppl saying stuff without citations so far mostly attributing treasure island with most of it
<Kjakings> 7No, this is Patrick
<Neon> Is this the Krusty Krab?
<Kjakings> 7No, this is Patrick!
<Neon> Trasure Island may have popularized it, but it doesn't seem too unlikely that it has a historical origin.
<Neon> Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
<Kjakings> 7Hold on, I didn't know the busses ran this late?
<Neon> They don't...
<Inokis> one seemingly legit site posts that parrots were often used as trade or to bribe officials since they were exotic
<Neon> I know one of the first things Columbus brought back with him were parrots.
<Kjakings> 7what's the third clue... green ooze coming out of the walls! No wait, they do that anyway
<Neon> No, no it's "But what was that third thing?! The walls will ooze green slime?! No wait, they always do that."
<Kjakings> 7at least it was a Sea Bear and not a Sea Rhinoceros
<Neon> Yeah, a dirt circle would never stand a chance against them.
<Kjakings> 7No, no it's "What attracts those?"
<Neon> PAtrick adds what I just said, then Squidward asks what you said.
<Kjakings> 7ooh
<Kjakings> 7sorry
<Kjakings> 7I haven't seen any in a while
<Neon> Lol, it doesn't matter.
<Kjakings> 7I do have that song from the marching band episode on my iPod though
<Kjakings> 7which is awesomesauceom
<Neon> I just have them memorized somehow, even though I haven't watched the show in, like, two years.
<Neon> Have you seen the Sick Spongebob video?
<Kjakings> 7no?
<Neon> It's bizarre and borderline sadistic.
<Kjakings> 7have you seen that trailer for the Facebook gritty reboot movie and the youtube spoof?
<Neon> Yes. xD
<Kjakings> 7the youtube spoof looks way more interesting
<Neon> I know, right? As it always is.
<Inokis> so that could be one reason for the sterotype
<Neon> Have you seen the Kane trailer?
<Inokis> +e
<Kjakings> 7no
<Neon> Watch at your own risk (Sick Spongebob): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-3acYotCc&feature=channel
<Neon> Indeed.
<Kjakings> 7I instantly have an aversion for it just from the thumbnail
<Neon> You should. It's an unpleasant but necessary viewing.
<Andres> Torrrrrent
<Inokis> downloading something specific?
<Neon> Ah, you have Torrents Syndrome?
<Kjakings> 7people keep trying to convince me of that about two girls, one cup
*Andres is just being silly and making fun of pirates :p
<Neon> XD
<Neon> No. I'll never watch that.
<Andres> http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/74fc5876-efbd-4eb0-86c0-d1120d6682c8.jpg D:
<Neon> Hahahahaha.
<Kjakings> 7is mayonnaise an instrument?
<Kjakings> 7it has to be said, the one time Squidwart wins he wins /spectacularly/
<Neon> Yeah, that's true.
<Neon> No, horse radish is not an instrument either.
<Kjakings> 7it's hardly a marching band, but still.
<Neon> Well, they did discover what it truly means to be in a marching band.
<Kjakings> 7no they didn't
<Kjakings> 7they discovered how to be kickass, but not a marching band
<Andres> IT IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER! TWENTY TWELVE! TWENTY TWELVE!
<Neon> Lawl.
<Neon> You're right, this is serious. Man the flying submarine.
<Inokis> lol
<Kjakings> 7type 'ill' into the youtube search bar. one of the suggestions is 'the illuminati killed michael jackson'
<Kjakings> 7also, 'just bieber gets hit by water bottle'
<Neon> Saw those.
<Neon> The Bieber one was unsatisfying.
<Neon> He needed to get hit like five times, minimum.
<Kjakings> 7ok. go to google. 'conspiracy theory the moon doesn't exist'
<Neon> xD Is that the CH one?
<Kjakings> 7no. it's a real conspiracy theory
<Neon> I think I've seen it.
<Neon> It was a man-made satelitte or something?
<Kjakings> 7"That's no moon, that's a space-station!"
<Neon> XD
<Kjakings> 7they believe it was a hologram or some shit
<Kjakings> 7black helicopters are micro-organisms
<Neon> ...Wot?
<Kjakings> 7some people believe black helicopters are alien life-forms, that start out as micro-organisms in the bloodstream
<Neon> That's hilarious. Now, how about when we see people flying these black helis?
<Kjakings> 7the chaingun on the front is used during their 'juvenile' 1-3cm stage to inject people with more microorganism black helicopters
<Kjakings> 7Neon: it's hidden by tinted windows
<Neon> xD Of course.
<Kjakings> 7why did I use 'Neon:'
<Kjakings> 7we're the only two people here
<Neon> I don't know, I do that sometimes also.
<Kjakings> 7Neon: really? :P
<Neon> :P
<Neon> Kjakings: Yes.
<Andres> My hovercraft is full of eels D:
<Kjakings> 7anywho, I need to go post. my insane (but in a James Bond villain way) necromancer is going to revive someone
<Neon> Very well then.
<Neon> Quickly, what species?
<Andres> Would you fondle my buttocks?
<Rose> um....
*Rose hides
<Inokis> lol
<Neon> For a price.
<Neon> What'cha got?
<Kjakings> 7http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/heir may I suggest this flash game to you?
<Andres> Never mind D:
<Neon> Nah, you mayn't.
<Neon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2svhjGrUVw
<Neon> Just kidding.
<Neon> Oh, you would welch.
*Andres watched Vampire Sucks Iron Man 2 today :3
<Andres> Put and somewhere between Vampire Sucks and Iron Man 2 D:
<Inokis> i wasn't impressed with iron man 2. i found myself annoyed a great deal at various parts
<LoopyDood> I agree with Inokis. I didn't really like Iron Man 2
<Andres> I liked the whips. :o
<Inokis> yes the effects were great
<Inokis> just the general atmosphere of the movie the personalities etc
<Inokis> was annoying
<Inokis> sort of like how they put the mom needlessly in transformers 2
<Inokis> and those two stupid bots
<Inokis> sort of like that
<Rose> O.o
<Neon> Ha, the stupid bots won't be back now. They were "racist."
<Curly> oh, yay :D
*Curly hugs her new vhost
*Andres huggletackles Curly
<Curly> oh wait
*Curly fallsover
<Curly> thar we go ^^
*Curly huggles Andres back
<Andres> :3
<Curly> let's try that again
<Curly> oh, yay :D
*Curly hugs her new vhost
*Andres noms eet.
<Andres> I remember I used to have a vhost here <3
<Andres> Don't remember what it was though :o
<Linky> request another one and it shall be activated
<Inokis> i don't see any difference
<Curly> oh. wait
<Curly> xD
*Curly is an idiot
<Curly> you're right, there is no difference, I was looking at the wrong thing in the whois list >.>
*Neon smashes a lamp.
<Curly> hey, that was expensive :O
<Neon> It was a gift.
<Curly> doesn't that just make it worse?
<Neon> Yes. >D
<Curly> D:
<Neon> I'm so evil, I have no eyes.
<Andres> They were delicious.
*Andres <3s eyes
<Neon> Glad they didn't go to waste.
<Curly> you didn't put them in your pizza did you? I don't like pizza with eyes >.>
<Andres> Of course not :o
<Curly> good ^^
*Curly keeps nomming happily then
<Neon> Psh, doesn't matter. You won't get any pizza.
<Curly> I totally did :O
<Curly> he emailed it to me
<Andres> I emailed her a whole pizza!
<Curly> :3
<Neon> Then I will have to plunge it from your stomach.
<Curly> why? D:
<Andres> I linked the images to this channel too last night though D:
<Neon> Because I'm evil, of course. My motives have no real basis.
*Neon gets to work.
<Curly> motiveless evil is boring >:
<Neon> Yeah, it is.
<Neon> Which makes it all the more torturous for you.
<Neon> XD
<Linky> Andres; /hs request <vhost here>
*Andres is truly neutral :3
<Andres> Do I want that? D:
<Neon> Do not want.
<Curly> I don't think it's possible to be true neutral >.>
<Curly> unless you're a cat :O
<Neon> It isn't possible, for a humana nyhow.
<Neon> *human anyhow
<Curly> Felix has no shame, no honour, no dignity, no conscience!
<Neon> xD
<Andres> True neutral alignment is described as selfish interest in only profiting themselves and the ones one loves.
<Curly> I think children are true neutral
<Curly> well, really really young ones
<Curly> mmmm... maybe up till 5
<Curly> or 10 maybe
<Curly> mmm... no 5 \
<Neon> One is only designated neutral because they don't want to get involved. Their motives are there, they just aren't in play.
<Andres> Would you really rate me as good or evil?
<Curly> I rate you as... chaotic silly :O
<Andres> Well, I am talking about the D&Dish alignments :p
<Neon> Lawl.
<Andres> D:
<Neon> Fail.
<Curly> I don't really know what to rate you as though
<Curly> but you seem to be on the good side of the spectrum as far as I can tell
<Andres> 02[21:41:50] *** -HostServ- The vhost provided is too long.01
<Andres> :(
<Neon> Ha, the Life Force spectrum.
<Neon> Are you of Fear, or are you of Love? xD
*Andres tried godlord.of.the.chaotic.realms.of.madness.that.are.the.mindscapes.in.my.head
<Curly> I'm of... logic :O
*Curly has no idea what the life force spectrum is though
<Curly> nice xD
<Neon> It's just from a movie, never mind.
<Neon> It was a fallacious argument that fear and love are the deepest of human emotions, and that any action can fit under those two categories.
<Curly> too many ellipses today...
*Andres is probably of chaos or madness D:
<Curly> well. I guess you could word any action to fall under either of those
<Curly> you'd have to redefine love though
<Neon> I disagree strongly.
<Neon> Fear and love aren't even direct opposites.
<Curly> do they have to be?
<Neon> Essentially, for all motives, "good" and "evil", to fall under them, they would have to be.
<Curly> fear and love have nothing to do with good or evil though >.>
<Inokis> wouldn't total lack of care for another person, be the opposite of love. not even hate just complete indifference, denial of someone else
<Neon> That's my point.
<Neon> In that argument they were.
<Curly> ooooh
<Curly> okay
<Curly> that's really dumb
<Curly> that's a non action Inokis
<Neon> Like, as an example, they said "So and so finds a wallet, take some money out, then gives is back. Is that an example of fear or love."
<Neon> *?
<Andres> A love for money and a fear for getting caught.
<Neon> But they made you pick one.
<Neon> Which is stupid.
<Neon> Most motives are far to complex to be boxed into two emotions.
<Neon> *too
<Inokis> most emotions are too complex for that as well
<Neon> Right.
<Neon> All I'm doing is analyzing a fallacy.
<Curly> well, I'll agree with you on most of that, although I think if you nail down the evolutionary roots of all actions then they all boil down to fear in the end
<Neon> According to Yoda they do.
<Neon> :P
<Curly> what? >.>
<Neon> "Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."
<Curly> um.......... I'm not sure how that correlates to what I just said :X
<Neon> Law, never mind. It was a joke.
<Neon> *Lawl
<Andres> continue not!
<Andres> Time of hammer it is!
<Neon> Suspend your current actions.
*Andres dances like Yoda
<Neon> My timepiece indicates a necessity for mallets.
*Neon is curious how Yoda would dance.
<Curly> my mallets are indicating a necessity for time, I think I'm doing something wrong D:
<Neon> Hm, you could very well be "doin it wrong."
<Neon> Well, where did these mallets come from?
<Andres> malletspace!
<Andres> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boAp2d_kayI
*Andres requested a hostling >:3
<Aristeo> :D
<Andres> Hi, SteoAri!
<Andres> I has a vHost! :o

<sally> weird
<Kjakings> 7oh yeah, we've been taking the piss out of Vulcan for being a pedofork
<Kjakings> 7wanna join in?
<sally> oooo
<sally> hi Maser
<sally> and mib_pseys2
<Icydragon> 12}:|
<Deathbat> It's a song about a talking dog performed by some spoons. Of course I like Scooby Doo, but still
<Icydragon> 12Lol homospoons...
<Cynder7> 6Vulcan?
<Kjakings> 7now all I can think about is people playing that song on some spoons
<Kjakings> 7which is 4.5 kinds of awesome
<Vulcan> 14hm?
<Deathbat> Spoons!<3
<Kjakings> 7you're an odd person
<Deathbat> Have you only just realised it? :D
<Cynder7> 6You can't download music from Grooveshark,can you?
*Icydragon 12cuddles Deathbat.
<Kjakings> 7No, but I feel it needs stating occaisionally
<Deathbat> Oh, ok
<Vulcan> 14it's more like an internet Playlist, but to download it either takes you to Amazon MP3s or iTunes.
<Kjakings> 7such as when a person touches something frozen and exclaims that it's cold
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Deathbat> Like a corpse?
<Deathbat> ...
<Deathbat> Oh dear XD
<Kjakings> 7no. That's not frozen. People liken it to being frozen but if that were so I'm sure your fingers would get stuck to it quickly
<Kjakings> 7or, in your case, your tongue
<Deathbat> Why would any sane person be licking a corpse?
<Kjakings> 7this is you, we're talking about
<Cynder7> 6I'll risk opening Limewire..
<Icydragon> 12DON'T!
<Cynder7> 6I'll probably brb again.. -.-
<Deathbat> I don't tend to lick corpses
<Deathbat> Don't lick corpses? Sound advice, Icy

*Stitch got it to 20. \o/
<Things> lol, I made a exe file that was disguised as GTA IV setup
<Things> Put it on a server
<Things> And it looks legit at first
<Things> But when you click continue, it removes all the close buttons n stuff, and starts playing a rick astley video

<Icy> 12:L
<Asezeal> 11orly?
<Neotyguy40> 3Yarly!
<Neotyguy40> 3See, the game is made so that the rules of that specific game must be followed ONLY when the game is in play (I.E. When you think about the game)
<Neotyguy40> 3So I invented "The Activity"
<Neotyguy40> 3Every time you think of the game, you will think of the activity. And the rule of the activity is that you win the game each time you think about it
<Asezeal> 11wtf?
<Neotyguy40> 3It's like an almost complete reverse of the rule that makes you lose the game!
<Icy> 12KISS ME!
<Neotyguy40> 3It's difficult to understand at first, but think about it a few times over and you'll get it =P

<Spyrorocks> Looks like its done.
<Spyrorocks> you guys wana see the code for it?
<Inokis> i really can't read code well
<Inokis> it woulnd't make sense to me
<Spyrorocks> http://pastie.org/private/mvib9o3btdqdnlm0p9sy6g
<Spyrorocks> thats all it took to make this bot.
<Spyrorocks> which includes the command to make it close from irc.
<Inokis> ur talented
<Spyrorocks> Thats using my new framework I am working on to show you how easy it is to use.
<Inokis> nicely done, like i said i don't know what any of it means, i can barely do if/else statements
<Andres> !exit
<epicWeather> Quitting. Goodbye!
<Andres> Mew :3
<Andres> I think that is a flaw :o
<Spyrorocks> Its not a flaw if its built in.
<Inokis> i mean i understand the program logic
<Inokis> for example i understand when you make a function
<Inokis> when you create the array
<Inokis> the values in the array
<Inokis> however
<Inokis> how you make the function work i don't understand the coding of it
<Spyrorocks> you understand the concepts though right
<Inokis> yes
<Spyrorocks> Dont learn programming from the code above
<Spyrorocks> its using my framework
<Spyrorocks> thatswhy it doesnt make sense
<Inokis> gotcha
<Spyrorocks> because my framework handles a lot of stuff behind the scenes
<Inokis> ive done some scripting in wow lua
<Inokis> and ive done limited php in web sites
<Inokis> thats all i can do
<Spyrorocks> thats why you dont ever see any function calls
<Spyrorocks> because my framework handles the events and stuff.

<Inokis> ahh
<Spyrorocks> have you seen my other ai bot?
<Inokis> that would be me
<Inokis> i have no knowledge of irc

<MrBot> That is what you learned in your studies?
<Spyrorocks> MrBot, correct.
<MrBot> We seem to be in agreement.
<Inokis> doh
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Inokis> spyro won
<Spyrorocks> sometimes you can trick him into insulting himself.

<Spyrorocks> MrBot, question: should I smoke weed?
<MrBot> smock it up wit them tooDUH find better friendsnah, my friends are so fuucking annoying because i smoke and shiit, him/her a hard time about it just live you own life and and them your friend live theres, or of coarse smoke it with them which i reckon is the best option. :)
<Spyrorocks> thats pretty random...
<Inokis> lol
<Spyrorocks> MrBot, question: is drinking and driving good?
<MrBot> Accidents hurt, saftey doesn't.A spil, a slip, a hospital trip.A safer you is a safer me.Alert today. Alive tommorow.
<Inokis> have no clue what they were trying to say
<Spyrorocks> MrBot, question: suicide
<MrBot> Beautiful Girls by Sean Kingston
<Inokis> search strings based on input
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Spyrorocks> its quite complicated.
<Inokis> i can imagine
<Spyrorocks> I hurt my brain
<Spyrorocks> with 7 dimentional arrays
<Inokis> when i used to play wow i would always hurt my brain trying to figure something out that i couldn't
<Spyrorocks> MrBot, what is an array?
<MrBot> A concept in computer science. It's a collection of objects allocated in memory in a consecutive fashion.
<Inokis> a couple months ago someone came along
<Inokis> and found one of my addons i made
<Inokis> he asked if he could take custody and continue work on it
<Spyrorocks> MrBot, where can I buy some weed?
<Inokis> so in some fashion
<Inokis> i contributed to wow
<MrBot> Yes.
<Spyrorocks> do you play a lot of wow?
<Inokis> i did i played for 4 years
<Inokis> i don't now
<Spyrorocks> I have a new friend i met at work
<Spyrorocks> and he says he plays wow all day every day
<Spyrorocks> when hes not working
<Inokis> i play city of heroes now
<Spyrorocks> he says he has no friend anymore.
<Inokis> aww
<Inokis> i don't have friends either
<Inokis> it makes me sad sometimes
<Spyrorocks> but hes happy that he can play wow.
<Inokis> i wish i was a more loving person
<Spyrorocks> Im friends with everyone
<Inokis> that i could feel love openly
<Inokis> but i can't
<Inokis> im hoping to fix that
<Spyrorocks> talking to me you'd never know im a programmer/webdesigner/super nerd.
<Inokis> everyong has diff levels of function
<Inokis> everyone
<Spyrorocks> Ive never been on a date though.
<Inokis> some times ppl have a high function in both technical and art/emotion
<Inokis> usually its one or the other
<Spyrorocks> Im technical but also have social skills
<Spyrorocks> I know what people like.
<Spyrorocks> If you dont have both it vbecomes too hard to make money.
<Inokis> well you are lucky to have such abilities
<Spyrorocks> Homeschooling does wonders to your character.
<Inokis> i can see how it would be good in some ways
<Inokis> i can also see the possibilities where it could stunt someone
<Spyrorocks> The argument of kids needing to socialize at school is bullshit.
<Spyrorocks> I never had to and I turned out just fine
<Spyrorocks> same with all the other homeschool kids ive met
<Inokis> it depends on the parents
<Spyrorocks> and ive met a lot.
<MrBot> Ho! Ha-ha! Guard! Turn! Parry! Dodge! Spin! Ha! Thrust!
<Inokis> you don't want a bunch of neo nazi propagandists homeschooling
<Spyrorocks> Probably not
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Inokis> what the kids learn depends on the parents
<Inokis> thats the rub
<Spyrorocks> But its really a parent's responsability to teach their kids.
<Inokis> yes but not all parent are fit to teach their kids anything
<Inokis> those are what you have to worry about
<Spyrorocks> depends if they are abusive.
<Inokis> not abusive
<Inokis> what if they are immoral
<Inokis> or unsound
<Spyrorocks> Its hard for me to respond to that
<MrBot> We're taking you to a clambake.
<Inokis> i learned a lot of stuff from my mom and thats why im in the situation i am in now
<Spyrorocks> because on one hand, I know some things rub me the wrong way
<Inokis> i have to get out of it
<Spyrorocks> But if I agree with that, I open the floodgates to someone else's perspective on what fit parents are
<Inokis> if i don't learn how to be a healthy person i will not survive much longer
<Spyrorocks> and everyone has something else to say.
<Spyrorocks> what happened with you?
<Spyrorocks> want me to take a random stab in the dark?
<Inokis> just too much emotional damage, too many relaltionship issues, too many things that i haven't been able to fix
<Inokis> and now
<Inokis> if i don't fix them
<Inokis> and soon
<Inokis> then i don't know where ill be
<Inokis> i won't be stable for sure
<Spyrorocks> so you say your parents screwed you up?
<Inokis> i won't be able to offer anyone anything
<Inokis> in some ways yes
<Spyrorocks> what was the most damaging?
<Spyrorocks> btw whats your age
<Inokis> physical and verbal abuse
<Inokis> im 36
<Spyrorocks> ah
<Spyrorocks> alright not a kid then.
<MrBot> So whaddya want? Wicker?!?
<Inokis> no im not a kid
<Inokis> i know what life entails i know it takes work
<Inokis> and effort
<Inokis> to be happy
<Spyrorocks> I was kind of expecting you to be a kid because I hear similar things froma lot of different younger people
<Inokis> well its supposed to get easier as you get older
<Inokis> and it hasn't
<Inokis> its actually getting worse
<Inokis> and im tired of coping with it
<Inokis> and getting nowhere
<Spyrorocks> where do you want to go?
<Inokis> i want to be diff than how i have been
<Spyrorocks> what do you want?
<Inokis> i want to be free of anger, i want to be someone ppl can seek for comfort and solace to offer love and for ppl to freely seek it from me
<Inokis> that is my goal
<Spyrorocks> whats stopping you?
<Inokis> my own ability to maintain stability conducive to such
<Spyrorocks> I see
<Spyrorocks> and meds is supposed to help?
<Inokis> meds are for the bad thoughts ive been having
<MrBot> "Shut up Spock, we're rescuing you" - McCoy.....
<Inokis> trying to make me more positive
<Inokis> rather than seeing the death inside i feel
<Spyrorocks> Im actually a pretty horrible person to talk to about stuff like this
<Inokis> and not being able to see past it
<Spyrorocks> Ive never been down that road
<Inokis> talking is talking
<Inokis> i have a followup in 4 weeks and i need to see someone for mental health in addition
<Inokis> im on the path
<Inokis> thats what counts
<Inokis> if i am to offer anyone anything meaningful
<Inokis> i have to do this
<Spyrorocks> I can't really offer you any advice...
<Spyrorocks> I dont have any experience like that.
<Inokis> no advice is needed
<MrBot> A liberal is nothing but a communist on Prozac!
<Inokis> talk is talk
<Inokis> you opened the door i told you freely
<Inokis> its merely me saying what it is
<Spyrorocks> I appriciate that
<Spyrorocks> I enjoy talking to different people about unique things.
<Inokis> well this isn't unique
<Inokis> its common to a lot of ppl
<Spyrorocks> thats probably right.
<Inokis> its unique for me
<Inokis> because i have never willfully
<Inokis> decided its time to be different
<Spyrorocks> Well, Ill pray for success for you in your endavours.
<Inokis> ty i take it ur religious
<Spyrorocks> You could say that.
<Inokis> ive always been agnostic
<MrBot> Storage Compartments? Storage Compartments?
<Spyrorocks> Well, everyone needs to find their own way.
<Inokis> indeed
<Spyrorocks> I'm not going to be preachy or anything.
<Inokis> you can talk about whatever you wish i like the philosophy and the study of religions
<Inokis> i find it interesting
<Spyrorocks> The important thing is you try to understand as much as you can about everything.
<Inokis> not everything i only try to understand things that interest me
<Inokis> its one of my flaws
<Spyrorocks> I force myself to take an interest in things contrary to what I belive
<Inokis> if i have no interest in something
<Spyrorocks> so that I can understand better.
<Inokis> then i ignore it
<Spyrorocks> I do a lot of reading.
<Spyrorocks> But I never read books.
<Spyrorocks> go figure.
<MrBot> Narrow minded: looks through keyhole with both eyes at the same time.
<Inokis> i used to read a lot more than i do now i like watching a lot of nova and history programs etc on pbs
<Spyrorocks> I can attirbute my love for php tutorials and various things to my lack of highspeed internet for most of my life
<Spyrorocks> I couldnt watch videos so i learned to love to read and program.
<Spyrorocks> now thats all I do because I love it.
<Inokis> i grew up before there was the internet
<Inokis> i didn't get my first online experience til i was in the navy
<Spyrorocks> I grew up with windows xp.
<Inokis> i grew up with atari
<Spyrorocks> Which isn't very old.
<Inokis> and coleco vision
<Spyrorocks> I kind of wish I grew up with some of that old gear
<MrBot> My favorite color? Red. No, BluAAAAAHHH!
<Inokis> lol
<Spyrorocks> that seems like it would have been fund
<Spyrorocks> fun*
<Spyrorocks> now its all focused on consuming rather than creating and learning.
<Inokis> yeah you had to pack every ounce of data you could you had to program smart
<Spyrorocks> companies dont say "hey, look at this, you can make this do whatever you want"
<Spyrorocks> they say "look what we made this do for you, dont you dare tinker with it!"
<Inokis> indeed
<Spyrorocks> and even at my youngish age, it saddens me.
<Inokis> its the way the world is though
<Spyrorocks> I cant expect everyone to like everything I like.
<Spyrorocks> But i mean.. it wouldn't hurt to know how to plug in the facebook machine.
<Inokis> the ppl with their market research have to justify their salaries and their jobs by getting ppl into little boxes of thinking
<Inokis> and doing things so the masses will flock
<MrBot> Spontaneous combustion! What a stroke of luck!
<Spyrorocks> and they are brilliant at it.
<Inokis> and make more money
<Spyrorocks> I'm not anti-making money
<Inokis> its the means
<Spyrorocks> Im all for having hordes of cash
<Inokis> yes
<Spyrorocks> But id like to see someone invest in some education for the masss
<Spyrorocks> masses*
<Inokis> but not by boxing ppl into the mass market strategies they use to push conformity
<Inokis> the whole mass market industry
<Spyrorocks> I want to see kids learn programming in school
<Spyrorocks> not how to use microsoft word
<Inokis> yep
<Spyrorocks> everyone knows how to use word, why waste time teaching kids that crap.
<Inokis> indeed
<Spyrorocks> Hell, teach them how to customize their myspace profile
<Spyrorocks> I dont care, learn some html.
<Inokis> lol
<Inokis> yep
<Inokis> i coded all my stuff in notepad
<Spyrorocks> Im teaching a web design class locally here
<Spyrorocks> Me too!
<Inokis> learned everything on my own
<MrBot> You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mr. Sulu
<Spyrorocks> I coded my entire irc bot framework in notepad
<Inokis> nice ur probably light years ahead of me i cna't program
<Spyrorocks> Notepad and photoshop are my web design tools.
<Inokis> yep just about
<Spyrorocks> thats all you need to make something great.
<Inokis> and now theres so many template sites that ppl don't even need to know anything
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<Spyrorocks> Im teaching a class of 15-20 young teens an intro to webdesign
<Inokis> very nice
<Spyrorocks> this fall.
<Spyrorocks> they are signing up because they are interested
<Spyrorocks> im charging them for it so I dont get losers who dont care.
<Inokis> i had no clue what html was
<Spyrorocks> I made it very clear they will learn CODE
<Spyrorocks> no fancy dreamweaver.
<Inokis> smart
<Spyrorocks> I hope I spark the interest of a few of them.
<MrBot> I'm floating in a most peculiar way.
<Inokis> it sounds like ur the person for it
<Spyrorocks> I have no formal education in it
<Inokis> i want to get into computer forensics
<Spyrorocks> Im totally self taught.
<Inokis> well ur brighter than i am
<Spyrorocks> Inokis, one of my favroite things as well :)
<Spyrorocks> I love security.
<Spyrorocks> I used to write a lot of POC malware
<Spyrorocks> when I was younger.
<Inokis> yeah i can't code anything
<Spyrorocks> I found a way to bypass all major commericial local firewall softwares
<Inokis> very nice
<Spyrorocks> to download and execute a payload
<Spyrorocks> the downloader was only 4.5kb in size
<Spyrorocks> im quite proud of that.
<Inokis> you just must have a brain for it
<Spyrorocks> I coded it in assembly.
<Spyrorocks> I know very little assembly.
<Spyrorocks> its too complicated for me
<Spyrorocks> I wish I understood more though.
<Inokis> i wish i had an ounce of that innate talent for even one thing
<Inokis> i have no innate talents
<Inokis> i have only the ability to learn
<Spyrorocks> If you want to learn Ill teach you free of charge.
<Inokis> maybe someday
<MrBot> The world bores you when you're cool.
<Spyrorocks> Any time.
<Spyrorocks> well not any time
<Inokis> lol
<Spyrorocks> when im finished working for the day
<Inokis> indeed
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Spyrorocks> perhaps theres other fields you want to try out.
<Spyrorocks> Not just computers?
<Inokis> actually im pretty set on the degree program here
<Inokis> its a 2 year computer forensics degree
<Inokis> a lot of legal
<Spyrorocks> alright then
<Inokis> a lot of computer tech
<Inokis> i have an interest in both
<Inokis> so it seems like a good fit
<Spyrorocks> I thought about going into that
<Spyrorocks> but didnt know if I could get a job after.
<Inokis> govt
<Spyrorocks> you know what id really love to do...
<Inokis> whats that
<Spyrorocks> infiltrate credit fraud rings onlin.
<MrBot> My nipples explode with delight!
<Spyrorocks> online*
<Inokis> thats part of computer forensice
<Spyrorocks> I know.
<Inokis> forensics
<Spyrorocks> If I could get paid to talk to these guys and get them that would be the best
<Inokis> yep
<Spyrorocks> I already know all the lingo and where they go and how they operate.
<Inokis> lol
<Inokis> sounds like you have a calling
<Spyrorocks> But im just as good of a web designer as I am at that
<Inokis> well you have all the avenues open to you then
<Spyrorocks> I kind of want to open an electronics shop...
<Spyrorocks> but I think it would just fail.
<Spyrorocks> gahh I have too many hobbies
<Inokis> ive wanted to open a comination business, coffee/sandwich place where you can use wifi or the workstations on site. the workstations would be pay as you go, also where would be tech support and a computer shop, even some classes maybe
<MrBot> Get a life!
<Spyrorocks> Inokis, I sort of had a similar idea
<Spyrorocks> setup some gaming pcs, some game consoles, let kids come in play around maybe buy some stuff
<Inokis> yep
<Spyrorocks> the problem is selling them things
<Spyrorocks> they dont have credit cards
<Inokis> if they have money offer reloadable cards that they can use in store
<Spyrorocks> Inokis, did you come from darchoods?
<Spyrorocks> the network
<Inokis> no i was here before darchoods
<Inokis> the merge was after i joined
<Spyrorocks> figured you seem too decent to be from there.
<Inokis> lol
<Spyrorocks> I was thinking billing their cellphones.
<Spyrorocks> every kid has one
<Spyrorocks> and you can do decent transactions on them.
<Inokis> that might work
<Spyrorocks> Ive done cell billing before
<Spyrorocks> it takes 45 days to get your cash though
<Spyrorocks> that sucks.
<Spyrorocks> I like having my cash NOW.
<Inokis> you'd have to make sure you had enough flow
<Inokis> to cover that sort of transaction
<Spyrorocks> or have a decent up front investment.
<MrBot> I try to make everyone's day a little more surreal.
<Inokis> yep
<Inokis> location is key
<Spyrorocks> im also interested in business.
<Inokis> for that sort of business
<Inokis> before i even tried it id hire marketing consultants
<Inokis> evaluators
<Inokis> everything
<Spyrorocks> make sure it can be profitable.
<Inokis> i would make sure where i put it would be optimal
<Linkeh> Spyrorocks; please keep your comments to yourself, you know nothing of us, and you didnt even make an attempt at such actions. kthx
<Spyrorocks> woah where'd you come from?
<Linkeh> im always around
<Spyrorocks> I thought you all left.
<Spyrorocks> my problem with business is im afraid of failure
<Spyrorocks> and as such I don't try too many different things
<Spyrorocks> I need to become bolder.
<Inokis> risks are risks because they can hold rewards
<Spyrorocks> exactly
<Linkeh> nah i did make a few friends over here sooo
<Spyrorocks> My uncle is my example for that
<MrBot> Bicycle Repair Man, how can I ever repair you? Well, you don't need to, gov, it's all right. It's all in a day's work for ... Bicycle Repair Man. <Sniff!>
<Spyrorocks> hes smart, great with people, and makes crazy cash
<Inokis> nice
<Spyrorocks> but money doesnt make him act any different.
<Inokis> it takes a strong character not to sway them
<Spyrorocks> hes the type of guy who would totally blow an important meeting if he knew you were in town for the day so he could take you out for lunch.
<Inokis> yep the sort of guy ppl can reach out to
<Spyrorocks> anyways, it was nice talking to you Inokis .
<Spyrorocks> Nice to meet new people.
<Spyrorocks> Its almost 3am here, need some sleep.
<MrBot> Take my Worf, please.
<Inokis> know they are there
<Inokis> thats the kind of person i want to be
<Inokis> get some sleep then
<Spyrorocks> yeah man, you ever need anything, feel free to pm or email.
<Inokis> indeed
<Spyrorocks> Im always around.
<Inokis> have a good night
<Spyrorocks> thanks :)
<Spyrorocks> make sure my bot doesnt crash.
<Inokis> okies
<Inokis> night linky im getting sleepy to you gonna be in rawr later?
<Linkeh> im always around :P
<Inokis> i don't see you in rawr atm is why i asked

<Corevette789> lol
<Andres> I WILL NOT!
<Andres> YOU CAN NOT FORCE ME!
<Neon> My / key is really screwed up. xD
<Spyrorocks> somebody tell me why the zune software keeps opening itself.
<Neon> But yes, I can. I have SkyNet on my side.
<Neon> Spyrorocks: It wants to be played with.
<Corevette789> Neon, mine was too yesterday
<Corevette789> Pry up the key and blow out all the dorito crumbs
<Neon> LOL
<Neon> Will do.
<Stormy`> Oh hi Neon
<Neon> "Hidey oh, neighbor."
<Neon> Well, there has been radio silence for a few days now, ehg? But I've been busy also.
<Neon> *eh
<Stormy> Well Lambda and I just moved back in to college
<Cynder7> 6*icypoke*
<Stormy> So we've been busy starting classes and all that
<Stormy> Not sure about everyone else though
<Spyrorocks> Oh I found the problem
<Spyrorocks> the zune was trying to sync itself wirelessly over and over again
<Neon> Yeah, I figured as much. Actually other have been on, just not really active.
<Spyrorocks> because it didnt have a good connection.
<Neon> Spyrorocks: I bet it just wanted attention.

<Spyrorocks> it got my attention.

<Stormy> I did see Mikey yesterday
<Stormy> She was gone by the time I got back from class though
<Neon> :/ Urgh. Oh, that OFF prank ended really badly.
<Icydragon> 12Hey Cynder7...
<Stormy> What happened?
<Neon> Well, evidently, someone was either so distracted or so gullible that about two weeks after I firsted posted the rick-roll video they were spending an hour every day to hunt for the trailer.
<Spyrorocks> !exit
<epicWeather> Quitting. Goodbye!
<Neon> I practically announced it was a ll a joke less than five days after the first day, yet they still followed it.
<Neon> I said one of the tags was "hail the Fuhrer" for crying out loud.
<Neon> *first
<Stormy> ...wow
<Stormy> They're obviously desperate
<Stormy> <.<
*Mayze curls up in the rafters
<Spyrorocks> !exit
<epicWeather> Quitting. Goodbye!
<Neon> I know. But there are like three people ganging up on me now, which I wouldn't mind, it's just that I actually respected them before this all.
<Neon> I even wrote a detailed apology, lol, and they'red still pissed. I'm just sitting back and laughing now.
<Neon> *they're
<Stormy> Fail
<Stormy> Didn't the trailer for that movie already come out anyway?
<Neon> There have been about five.
<Neon> It's just that we beefed up the story, saying it said it was now rated PG-13 and there was lots of blood.
<Stormy> And they're that excited for another one? XD
<Andres> tr4n513370r
<Andres> I need one. :o
<Neon> This was a while ago, though. The topic got to like nine pages before they realized it was a ruse. And yes, they are.
<Neon> One guy on there is getting so annoying. He's like "
<Neon> "zomg LOTG SOUNDTRACKZ WOOOOOOOOOOO WHOS BUYIN IT!?"
<Stormy> Lol
<Neon> But whatever. It was so entertaining up until the point where this anal-retentive girl decided that now she could "no longer take the honesty of the forum for granted" and was "far too busy were her advanced grade courses for such pointless games."
<Stormy> I hate how annoying fans seem to have the capability of ruining fandom. =/
<Neon> *with her advanced
<Stormy> XD
<Neon> Literally her entire argument was saying that my prank had dealed a serious blow to her homework time, and she was now struggling thanks to me.
<Neon> That and her "eleven pets that need constant care."
<Andres> By Azura, by Azura!
<Stormy> ...because of course it's your fault that she's obsessed enough to waste her time searching for a trailer when she has responsibilities
<Neon> But yeah, they really do. It's partially the Internet's fault.
<Stormy> Logic at its finest
<Neon> Well, of course. Everyone needs a scapegoat.
<Neon> She went so far as to say that I feel the need to be worshipped and thats why I did this prank. For publicity or something. xD Care to read the topic?
<Stormy> LOL
<Stormy> Sure
<Neon> xD Pm'd it.
<Stormy> Haha, I would click the link before checking the volume
*Stormy just blasted the first 5 seconds of Never Gonna Give You Up in Spanish to the entire hall
<Neon> XDDDD
<Neon> You have my sympathy.
<Stormy> lol "maybe your computer has a virus"
<Neon> xD Mikey was such a good help.
<Neon> And that user Gyfore was pretty convincing.
<Stormy> I can't believe they actually bought this
<Neon> A lot of people went in on it with us without us having to ask them.
<Neon> Well, most were noobs. One girl, the main one I spurned, is pissed at me. I'm hoping it's just hormonal.
<Stormy> Ahahahaha I love how you suggest clearing the browser cache
<Neon> :P Gyfore: "Try clicking this." and it's the exact same link.
<Stormy> XD

<Stormy> "Cut the racdrops, man. We've got you figured out." XDDD
<Neon> :P GoG lingo was so fun to use against them.
<Stormy> "Why in the name of Hoole would I do that?"
<Neon> Hahaha, yeah.
<Neon> That entire fourth page makes it painfully obvious this was all a joke, yet they act utterly insulted when I said I didn't expect them to be fooled for so long.
<Neon> "How the he** were we supposed to even SUSPECT those videos were on purpose?" Oh my...
<Stormy> hah
<Stormy> Just got to that post
<Neon> I know I've pumped you fll of bias by only telling you my end of the story, but they had no real basis for that argument other than misplaced rage.
<Neon> *full
<Stormy> I don't see any good reason for them to make such a big deal about it
<Stormy> So there's no trailer
<Stormy> No harm /was/ done
<Stormy> And if they wasted time, that was their own fault -.-
<Neon> Meh. Everyone was so invested in that new trailer, because they were all getting disatisfied with how the movie appeared. I admit I exploited that, but yeah, there was no harm done and their own gullibility is at fault.
<Neon> I mean really... they searched "hail the fuhrer" as a tage? Please.

<Neotyguy40> Hello!
<Neotyguy40> Crap. No one here
*Kitten grins
*Neon breaks the fourth wall.
<where> Wait, you mean this isn't real/
<where> It's just a movie or something?
<where> \:O/
<Kitten> so my mom got my hopes up by saying that the ice cream cones should still be good, i went and took a bite of one and it was stale, so i had her take a bite and she's like they're stale and i'm not going out tonight to get some more. So! i go to my older brother and make this cute pathetic voice and look at him all pouty like and say "momma got my hopes up then crushed them"..
<Kitten> he responds "awww how?" and i tell him what happened and he's like "aww dollar general is closed or i'd get you some.. how much are they at iga" i tell him for coloured ones they're like 2.39" he's like "ok if you can wait till my show is off then i'll go get you some ice cream cones"
<Kitten> ^-^
<Neon> Where: Yeah, dude. A sequel, actually.
<where> Kitten uses her powers of persuasion for evil.
<where> Sequel?
<where> :o
<where> To what?
<Neon> Kitten: Haha, the pouty face strikes again.
<Neon> Mhm. I'm not sure, I've never seen the first one. We're supporting characters, though, I'm sure of that.
<Kitten> not evils, for yummy's!
<Neon> Yummies are evil, aren't they?
<Kitten> not all of them!
<Neon> Oh, but I bet you have some kind of evil intent. Otherwise there's no way you could procure ice cream so efficiently.
<Kitten> not ice cream, i got that earlier cause it was on sale and i didn't even ask for it
<Kitten> ice cream cones!
<where> Exactly.
*where noms the evil Kitten
<where> :D~
<Neon> Psh, see. You had the ice cream but you still /wanted MORE/.
<Kitten> Stitch!!! Ari!!!!!!!
<where> D:
<Neon> Now the cone is needed.
*where runs
<Kitten> uh huh the cone is needed for the ice creams
<Kitten> its vanilla and orange creme ice cream
<Kitten> i'm gonna have it when i turn 18 *nods*
<where> :o
<where> But when you're 18, you lose your icecream stomach.
<where> So you can't fit it in anymore.
<where> And you become mean.
<Kitten> ice cream keeps me from becoming mean
<Kitten> ask Ari if i don't have my ice cream i get very tempermental
<Neon> Well, that just explains everything, doesn't it? Only someone so evil would enjoy such a kind.
<Neon> XD
<Neon> Welcome back.
<where> But you wont be able to fit it in anymore
<where> So you will become mean.
<where> It all makes sense.
<Neon> So, in essence, it "cools you off"?
<Stormy> Hey
*where does some mean things, just to prove his point >:|
<Kitten> yes!
*Kitten is not evil
<LaptopAristeo> :O
<Neon> I wonder how people like you avoided being mean before ice cream.
<where> They didn't!
<InfamousZed> hey
<where> Like in the medieval days.
<where> Everyone was mean.
<where> And torturing each other, burning everyone, etc.
<InfamousZed> hows the nazi free zone treating ya
<Kitten> is just sweet.. not evils
<Stormy> awesome
<Stormy> the only complaint I have is that my room doesn't have air conditioning
<Stormy> So it gets /really/ hot on the third floor, even with a fan <.<
<InfamousZed> yikes
<Stormy> Also, way too much homework for the first couple days
<InfamousZed> spring for a fridge and lay it next to your bed wide open
*Stitch appears!
<InfamousZed> yeah i hear ya
<Stormy> My bed is bunked
<Kitten> lates..
*Kitten curls up to Stitch
<Stitch> D;
<InfamousZed> extenton cord
<InfamousZed> :P
*Stitch pets.
<Kitten> [20:18] * +where noms the evil Kitten
<Kitten> [20:18] <+where> :D~
<Neon> Haha, some of the Middle Ages torture is called singing these days.
<Stormy> My desk is attached to the bed and sits below where another bed usually would
*Neon is back, late.
<Stitch> ...
<Kitten> i not evil am i?
*Stitch smacks where.
<InfamousZed> ah those types...
<Stitch> Absolutely not.
<Neon> It times like these where you wish you could use Rain Dance.
*Kitten cuddles Stitch
<Stormy> It's already raining though :P
*Stitch scratches behind ears. ^^

*Kitten purrs
<InfamousZed> guess what that is stormy
*Stormy waits for it to load
<InfamousZed> still loading?
<Stormy> No
<Stormy> what is it?
<InfamousZed> guess
<InfamousZed> the pic is sideways
<InfamousZed> and its looking through a scope of a gun
<Neon> Kitten: Oh, you certainly are.
<Neon> You wicked child.
<where> :/
<Stormy> :O
*where is smack'd
<Stormy> You're gonna shoot your Umbreon?
<Stormy> D:
<InfamousZed> lol
<Neon> Hahahahaha.
<Neon> Who touched Umbreon's gun?
<Kitten> teenager!
<Kitten> i'm 17 almost 18
<Kitten> not a child!
<InfamousZed> lambda and ryft talked me into taking a pic of me and my gun and i took a few extras
<Neon> Haha, technically you are a child until eighteen.
<Neon> Depending on your culture.
*where pats little Kitten on the head.
<InfamousZed> too bad the dsi's camra sucks
<InfamousZed> http://infamouszed.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2xaiq6
<where> Shhh, the grownups are talking.
<where> >:D>:D>:D
<Neon> No lie, you look pretty badass right there.
<Neon> Not sure if that was censored.
<Stormy> it wasn't
<Stormy> It only censors "asses
*Kitten growls
<InfamousZed> the censor was the general crappy quality of teh pic itself
*Neon cues Charlie Brown adult speech.
<Stormy> I think
<Stormy> was that censored?
<Neon> D: What hath we wrought?!
<InfamousZed> no
<Neon> Nope.
<Stormy> huh
<Neon> It must have been removed.
<InfamousZed> its just that you can barely make out anything of it
<InfamousZed> what?
<InfamousZed> removed?
<Stormy> glasses
<Stormy> grasses
<Neon> Clear as day.
<InfamousZed> what about my glasses?
<Neon> Unless of course the day is foggy.
<Stormy> muffins?
<Neon> xD Also not censored.
<Stormy> cucumbers?
<where> D:
<Stormy> o.o
<Neon> Woah, we can say normal words now.
<Neon> Even cucumber! D:
<Stormy> xD
<InfamousZed> hey what happened to the dark hoods stuff
<Neon> This is what I get for calling people who are older than me children.
<Stormy> We unmerged last Thursday
<Stormy> We decided the merge wasn't in the best interests of the network
<Neon> SR: Did you get the matter-creating app yet?
<Stormy> louve was not pleased, apparently
<InfamousZed> ah
<Neon> Plus, the official decree is that the DarcHoods are far too gangsta for us.
<where> lol?
<InfamousZed> with a who or a what?
<where> How old are you, Neon?
<Spyrorocks[ipad]> Not yet
<Neon> Old enough to drink in Italy.
<Stormy> o.O
<Stormy> really?
<Neon> Indeed. I'm curious how that works for them.
<Neon> Where: Sixteen, if you must know.
<Stormy> either about the unmerge or mad at Aristeo/the network for making that decision
<Stormy> I wasn't there so I don't know
<Stormy> But apparently louve refused Aristeo's help in getting DarcHoods back on its feet
<where> Awww.
<where> So cute.
<Stormy> Maybe they just have much stricter punishments for drunk driving
<Stormy> That's how it is in Germany I've heard
<Neon> Probably. Haha, or they could just bump up the age to drive.
<Stormy> The drinking age is really low but no one ever drinks and drives because they'll actually get their license taken away
*Stormy doesn't understand why we don't do that here
<Spyrorocks[ipad]> My cousin was permanently brain damaged by a drunk driver
<Neon> Hm... do they drink and text? Far more dangerous, in my opinion.
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> Or text and drive
<Neon> SR: Sorry to hear that.
<Spyrorocks[ipad]> I tried to text a drive and almostmdrove into a ditch
<Neon> Lol, yeah. My psychology teacher was lamenting about that today, actually.
*LaptopAristeo got a highlight!
<Neon> Yeah, that was a little bad for morale.
*Stormy highlighted Aristeo
<LaptopAristeo> :3
*Neon takes out a highlighter and scribbles on Aristeo's face.
<LaptopAristeo> You're supposed to do that when I'm sleeping!
*Neon knocks Aristeo out.
<Neon> Very well.
<LaptopAristeo> :/
<where> What's the driving age over there?
<Stormy> And you're supposed to use a sharpie so he can't wash it off
<Stormy> :P
*LaptopAristeo can't type when he's sleeping D:
<Neon> Five.
<Stormy> It's 16 here
*Stormy is not sure about Italy though
<where> lol
<InfamousZed> nah... you get a tatoo gun and...
<where> Stormy, where is here?
<Neon> Listen, it was essential to the joke that a highlighter was used, alright? racticality doesn't apply. :P
<where> I'm going to hazard a guess at america.
<Stormy> Yeah
<Neon> *Practicality
<Stormy> Specifically Minnesota
<Stormy> Although I think the driving age is the same in every state
<Sartre> my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products, like tires
<Neon> Where: I'm going to hazard a guess that by using that phrase you are not. xD
<Neon> Stormy: I believe it is eighteen in a few states.
*LaptopAristeo eventually helped them get back on their feet
<Neon> In CT it was eighteen for a short time before being revoked.
<Stormy> If I lived there I wouldn't be so late getting my license
<Sartre> I'm almost eighteen and I don't even have my learners, so driving conversations mean nothing to me :D
<Stormy> Hehe
<Stormy> I just got my license this month
<Stormy> I'm 19 and have had my permit since 15
<where> <+Sartre> my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products,
<where> That's all i read.
<Neon> I've had a few chances to get my permit, but I don't even want it yet.
*where steals everyone's context
<Neon> Where: XDDDDDD
<where> Sartre, I AM 18 and don't have my leaner's!
<where> :D
<Steve> 12 Hello, ixr and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Neon> At least Sartre is being safe.
<where> lol
<Sartre> How nice for you, where
<where> Hehe
<Stormy> A wild ixr appeared!
<where> i need to do it the next month though
<where> because my sister turns 16
<Neon> My cousin is 20 and has vowed to never get his license. xD
<Sartre> I saw a Lincoln truck picking up someone at school today
<where> And will go for hers as soon as soon as she does
<ixr> Rawwr
<Sartre> Made me wish I had had an old truck to smash into it
*Neon throws Bait!
<where> And she's been saying for over a year that she'll get hers before i get mine.
*where goes of to get noms
*InfamousZed throws mud!
<Sartre> off*
*ixr takes bait and throws mud back at inf
<Sartre> Is there a reason rich people flaunt their wealth other than to be flashy and pretend everyone likes them?
<Neon> Wait, wait. You mean rich people in general, or some rich people?
<Sartre> I mean the ones that already have two personal jets and just bought a third for $80,000,000, or the ones that buy stupidly expensive vehicles, like a Lincoln truck
<ixr> Well as thrilling as that was
<ixr> I must be going
<Neon> Hahaha, well, even some people that do that aren't jerks.
<Stormy> But... you just got here dude
<Sartre> I didn't call them jerks
<Neon> Was literally halfway through writing "Dude, you just got here. "
<Stormy> :P
<Sartre> I called them flashy morons, which they are
<Neon> I was paraphrasing, I guess. That can fall under the jerk category, methinks.
<InfamousZed> Dude, you just got here.
<Neon> But not every wealthy person that buys that pointless stuff is a flashy moron.
<Sartre> Is there a reason to own three personal jets?
<Neon> You just dude but here got.
<Stormy> Wait, who owns three personal jets now?
<Neon> Jessi Slaughter and the Mario Bros.
<Sartre> Friend of a friend
<Stormy> lol Jessi Slaughter
<Neon> Sartre: There might be a logical reason to, for someone.
<Stormy> The attack of the ping got where
<Stormy> D:
*Sartre shoots Ping in the head
<Stormy> lol... OK then
<Neon> That obnoxious guy Ping keeps giving everyone a timeout.
<Neon> What does he think, he's their parent?
<InfamousZed> dam... lost the remote...
<Neon> Eveidently where was an unruly child.
*Stormy sends Ping to the time out corner
<Neon> Ixr is so humorusly cynical.
<Neon> *humorously
<Neon> "Sometimes, I lose the remote!"
<InfamousZed> wheres the lambda today?
<Stormy> He's at work right now
<Neon> A taste of his own Chinese medicine.
<Stormy> Should be back any minute now
<InfamousZed> right now?
<Neon> Oooh, Lambda is coming?
<Sartre> my headache went away
<Neon> Cool beans.
<Sartre> This happened hours ago though I'm just noticing it now
<Stormy> Maybe not
<Stormy> We both have a lot of homework
<Stormy> I probably shouldn't even be here right now actually
<Stormy> -.-
<Neon> Haha, I sprained my wirst somehow and by you mentioning that I just realized it has stopped hurting.
<Neon> *wrist
<InfamousZed> to hell with homework!
<InfamousZed> talk to us!
<Neon> :P Ah, well. I understand
<Sartre> Oh no, the police told me to stop, I must comply
<Stormy> like right now, I should be reading 160 pages about java
<InfamousZed> aye...
<Stormy> and writing an essay about the title of the course Justice and Call to Servant Leadership
<InfamousZed> are they like grandpa print or chinese squinty print
<Sartre> My school is overcrowded
<LaptopAristeo> My school has 2,600 people in it :3
<Sartre> It sucks, especially when most people just stand in the way and then yell when you bump into them
<Stormy> it's not too bad
<Stormy> the usual size textbook text
<Sartre> My school has 2800-3000 or so
<LaptopAristeo> :O
<LaptopAristeo> You win :(
<Stormy> Lol
<Sartre> there are like fourty kids on my bus
<Sartre> It is horrible
<LaptopAristeo> But I'm in a college :3
<LaptopAristeo> So lots of room
<Stormy> My high school had about 2400
<LaptopAristeo> We have our own city, it seems, we're so spread out
<InfamousZed> I usually dont read any of the books i have very much
<Stormy> My college is actually a lot smaller than that
<Neon> Squint print, lol.
<Stormy> I know what if statements are, stupid textbook
<InfamousZed> you know what i hate.. the freaking orientation homework...
*Stormy skips about five pages
<Steve> 12 Hello, ixr and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Stormy> Orientation homework?
<Neon> You rebuke that textbook.
<InfamousZed> i get saying hi to everyone on the course but i know how to navigate a website...
<InfamousZed> its online homework crap
<Neon> Ixr: ttz or gtfo
<ixr> Itz?
<Neon> Ttz. xD
<InfamousZed> neon forgets that ixr talks with a peice of fruit
<InfamousZed> thus probably cannot see that acronym
*LaptopAristeo likes his college
<ixr> Ttz?
<LaptopAristeo> I talked to the Vice President of the college today :D
<LaptopAristeo> And the chief academic officer
<Neon> It's not even an acronym.
<Neon> It's just an intention misspelling of tits.
<ixr> Tits?
<InfamousZed> abreviation sory
<InfamousZed> *sorry
<LaptopAristeo> Everyone is just soooo accessible
<Neon> Were their assassination attempts on either?
<ixr> I just heard that today
<ixr> Rule 31
<LaptopAristeo> Not this time
*Neon sighs.
<Neon> Good.
<Neon> *there
<LaptopAristeo> The Vice President lent me some of his books too :)
<LaptopAristeo> Which was nice of him
<ixr> Well ggtfo
<LaptopAristeo> They were given to him as a gift in 2003 by the Chief Academic Officer :3
<LaptopAristeo> When I was 12 years old
<LaptopAristeo> And he just lent them to me >.>
<where> You were 12 years old and knew what that was?
<where> :o
<Neon> xD
<LaptopAristeo> xD
<Neon> Nice.
<LaptopAristeo> Yeah, I've been going to college for a couple decades
<Neon> Naw...
<LaptopAristeo> I probably need to give him back those books since it's been like seven years :P
<ixr> Naw?
<Neon> Wan.
<LaptopAristeo> That's why you don't change your major so often :P
<Sartre> Damn
<Sartre> I hate having a cut here
<Sartre> Stings
<ixr> K
<Neon> D:
<Stormy> Lambda just got back
<Stormy> He says hi

*Sartre swears and punches someone in the face
<Sartre> Just below my right index finger*
<ixr> Tell him to accept my invite so we can play dammit
*where is punched D:
<Neon> Punching might irritate the cut.
*Sartre glares a where
<Sartre> I know
<Stormy> He says he'll go do it right now
<Sartre> I'm agitated
<Sartre> I do stupid things when I'm agitated
<Stormy> but he doesn't have time to play right now

<LaptopAristeo> Might be a parody of something
<LaptopAristeo> Possibilities:
<LaptopAristeo> I'm on a Boat parody, Old Spice parody
<Stitch> OLD SPICE
<Stitch> DO IT
<Maser> I like bigbutts and I can not lie.
<Shy> oh yeah, is that so Maser?
<LaptopAristeo> "Look at your college, now look at mine. Now back to your college, and *back* *to* *mine*. Sadly, it isn't like mine, but if you switch to Snead State and stop messing around with other places, then your college would be mine"
<LaptopAristeo> Or something :o
<Maser> you otha' brotha's can't dee-nie.
<Maser> lol @ that parody
<LaptopAristeo> Or maybe we could do something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp5hkX9SiW8
<Stitch> "Look down. Back up. Where are you? You're in a classroom, with a professor with 12 degrees. What's in your hand? Back to me. I have it. It's your diploma that's good for almost any job out there. Look again. The diploma is now cash! Anything is possible when you go to Snead State University and not any other college. I'm on a bike."
<Inokis> i think you should all just perform if you wanna be my lover and the guys should be in dresses and the girls can be in bunny suits
<LaptopAristeo> It needs to be something that will become viral :3
<LaptopAristeo> And make Ray William Johnson talk about it

<LaptopAristeo> I've noticed that with a lot of the black people here at the college -- they talk like their mentally retarded (ebonics, ftl) and they're kind of loud and obnoxious
<LaptopAristeo> It's not something to do with their skin tone, of course
<LaptopAristeo> But I think they see that as their role in society and so they choose not to rise above it

<Neon> Hey.
<Neon> Herro.
<Andres> Ohai
<Neon> Ver the Vicious Viking Vassal.
<Neon> *Var
<var> Heya
<VtVVV> I like it
<VtVVV> Though I think my net hates me ):
<Andres> You know, Vikings were afraid of my ancestors :o
<Andres> Well, at least they did not mess with them :3
<Neon> Haha, and who were your ancestors?
<Andres> Estonians of course :p
<Neon> Hohoho.
<Neon> Did they encounter each other even to be considered spared? :P
<Andres> Of course, there were trade relations :o
<Andres> I fail to see how your question is meant to be built.
<Neon> I was forcing an opinion that they were spared rather than not messed with.
<Neon> Which is probably why the question confused you, lol.
<Andres> Well, the Estonian pirates still sunk their ships and sold them on their slave markets D:
<Neon> Hahaha, nice work there.
<Andres> So I would think that that would not be a problem :o
<varchld> I don't like the sound of being a viking anymore :x
<Andres> Why? :o
<Neon> But your version of "trade" is a heft ax in the head in exchange for awesome plunder.
<Andres> They still pwned lots of other folks :o

<Andres> Well, we allowed them to use our rivers to get us those precious Arabian coins :o

*Andres shrugs.
<Andres> They built their ships to be light anyway.
<Neon> Yeah, I know. It was either there or some other barbarian-like group who made them light enough to be either carried or broken up and rebuilt near another body of water. Pretty cool concept.

<JLF> hey nintendofreak
<nintendofreak> hey jlf
<JLF> what's up?
<nintendofreak> a little annoyed since conduit 2 got delayed to next year
<JLF> oh i'm sorry
<nintendofreak> not really surprised though it had to compete with golden eye and call of duty
<JLF> ah, i'm doing a dark spyro walkthrough
<JLF> *playthrough
<JLF> not too hard
<JLF> i don't think i'm gonna use dark spyro on ravage rider
<nintendofreak> ravage rider = fail of a boss just an easier steam
<Icy> 12 nintendofreak: Not cool.
<JLF> true but ur tip works better on ravage as opposed to dark spyro
<nintendofreak> now what icy >.>
<Icy> 12You know what.
<JLF> oi
<JLF> *slaps forehead
<nintendofreak> i havnt posted anything else :p
<Icy> 12Doesn't matter...
<JLF> way to interrupt a convo
<JLF> <.<
<Icy> 12Well, excuse me.
<JLF> just sayin
<Icy> 12Whatever.
<JLF> what did nintendofreak do?
<JLF> he was just stating how ravage is a fail of a boss
<nintendofreak> he was refering to something else
<nintendofreak> lol
<JLF> oh
<JLF> lol
<JLF> a fail of a boss is the executioner
<Icy> 12Icy x ghey... no... just no...
<JLF> only boss i like on that game is elemental dragon
<nintendofreak> lol icy :p ehh elemental wasn't much of a challenge favorite boss ehh not really any of them
<JLF> oh
<JLF> skabb was least fav
<JLF> fav boss in dotd was golem
<JLF> least fav was malefor
<Icy> 12I love how people say that that dragon represents cynder, that may be, but considering the rest of the bosses, I say they were lazy, and recolored her...
<nintendofreak> ^ no kidding thats all what eternal night was just a reskin
<JLF> arborick = asshole
<JLF> skabb = cheap
<Icy> 12Whole game= cheap.
<nintendofreak> ^ agreed
<JLF> it could of been worse
<nintendofreak> flash back of etd ok...... yeah
<Icy> 12I still like it, but it's my least fav los game.
<JLF> could of been like AHT
<JLF> ewww
<Kjakings> 7That's like saying being hit with a wooden bat could've been worse because it could've had a nail through it. It's still /bad/
<nintendofreak> i didn't really like aht but atleast the game didn't have a lot of cheap enemies and recolored enemies/textures
<JLF> it had cheap levels
<nintendofreak> although i really hated the blink missions -_-'
<JLF> that fire level was stupid
<Icy> 12^ same
<JLF> with the fire birds and fire guys
<JLF> i hate the sparx missions
<Icy> 12I hated all the non-spyro levels.
<JLF> same
<JLF> the penguin ones were dumb
<Icy> 12Well, I liked hunter, he should have had more levels.
<JLF> hunter was cool
<Kjakings> 7hunter was stupid
<JLF> blink was ok
<JLF> i hate the elders
<Kjakings> 7blink was stupid. The byrd levels were alright, but the whole point of byrd was that he could fly without a jetpack
<JLF> red was a pathetic boss
<JLF> so was that fat sea lady
<JLF> only boss i had trouble with was gnasty gnorc
<Kjakings> 7it annoys me that they completely removed all sign of Bentley's intelligence
<JLF> Bentley was in etd
<Kjakings> 7and that they removed Sheila and Bianca completely. They were the awesomest
<Kjakings> 7Bentley was in AHT. That's not the point, the point is that they made him stupid
<JLF> he was in aht?
<JLF> which level?
<Kjakings> 7the hunter one I think
<JLF> oh ok
<JLF> i miss bianca
<Kjakings> 7they should've put Bianca in DotD and done Hunter/Bianca missions
<JLF> one of the elders in aht is gay
<nintendofreak> bentley was somewhere in the ice world during the hunter level
<JLF> oh ok
<Kjakings> 7Hunter already defies the laws of physics with his ludicrously slow arrows
<JLF> that fat elder in the swamp level was gay
<JLF> like he looks gay
<JLF> well i'll talk to u all later
<JLF> bye guys
<nintendofreak> see ya

<LaptopAristeo> Their loaded baked potatoes are pretty good :3
<Kjakings> 7... explain?
<Andres> Hell yeah it is loaded. :o
<Spyrorocks``> On spyroforum theres some thread where people are saying a lady should die because she threw puppies into a river.
*Andres waves around his antimatter gun as if it was a feather-
<Kjakings> 7I see.
<Spyrorocks``> Kind of reminds me of my friend who's mom puts cats in a box and shoots it with a shotgun.
<Kjakings> 7where would she get so many cats?
<Spyrorocks``> her cats breed and other people's cats come to her house and breed
<Spyrorocks``> too many kittens all over and they make a mess.
<Spyrorocks``> that video shows pretty much the same idea, dog has puppies and you can't take care of them.

<sally> i know you can do thaaaat
<mib_1xb2yn> oh
<sally> but like..
<mib_1xb2yn> there's no trace of it
<sally> buuuuut
<sally> when you are going to type in a website it shows what someone else has already gone to
<sally> i wanna get rid of that too
<sally> i know how to do it
<sally> but it deletes ALL of the history when u do that
<sally> and when it deletes all of the history then that shows that the history has been deleted
<mib_1xb2yn> just visit a bunch of random websites then :P
<sally> lol but it's too late for that kinda
<mib_1xb2yn> hmm
<sally> cuz i've been deleting stuff this whole time without realizing that it deletes everything
<sally> usually it shows the history from 3weeks ago or something
<sally> but now it isnt there anymore :x
<sally> which shows that someone that isnt supposed to beo n the computer is in fact on the computer lol
<sally> be on*
<mib_1xb2yn> heh
<mib_1xb2yn> Try just deleting the pages from the certain days
<mib_1xb2yn> it'll take a while
<mib_1xb2yn> but it won't delete everything
<sally> yeah but if i do thaaat
<sally> it'll still show what pages i've been on
<sally> :D and you are proto cuz proto says heh cuz he is cool like that
<sally> i mean you are cool like that :3

<sally> lol oooh
<Kirara> 073
<Quilava> what for?
<Kirara> 07they require you have at least 15 posts in their forums
<Kirara> 07before you can sign up for their Tutor Program
<Kirara> 07i've already gotten 15
<Kirara> 07but i want to overshot it to 20 so it doesn't seem like i only posted in the forums to gain access to the tutor program
<Quilava> I...see
<Kirara> 07posting in forums is so hard for me thoug
<Kirara> 07though
<Kirara> 07so this has been a dragged out stupid fight
<Quilava> sounds fun :|
<Kirara> 07i know
<Kirara> 07tell me about it, there was hardly anything i wanted to post about
<Quilava> thats one of the reasons I hate forums :/
<Kirara> 07same
<Kirara> 07its cruel to have a post requirement for their tutor program
<Kirara> 07oh well i have 17 posts now
<Kirara> 07i'm only 3 posts away from reaching my goal
*AwayAristeo runs off to get some food
<Kirara> 07[16:35:29] <Kirara> perhaps playing a game of magic will make me feel better

<Kirara> 07lol
*Kirara teaches Skylands how to play magic the gathering
*AwayAristeo leaves a hug for sally if she comes back
<Skylands> 10Uninteresting
<Kirara> 07don't say that D:
<Kirara> 07what if i said watching paint dry was uninteresting
<Skylands> 10It is
*Quilava squeaks.
<Kirara> 07true
<Kirara> 07anyway magic is interesting
<Kirara> 07because there is literally anything you can do
<Kirara> 07there are cards for everything from winning to losing on purpose
<Kirara> 07Quilava
<Kirara> 07my one deck i built loses on purpose unless it gets a certain card out XD
<Quilava> it wouldn't happen to be a 'if you would lose this turn, you win instead' card would it? :|
<Kirara> 07no
<Kirara> 07guess you just have to play it to find out
<Quilava> guess so
<Kirara> 07lol
<Kirara> 07i didn't even know that card existed Quilava
<Kirara> 07anyway i was going to ask healinglugia to look at the deck
<Kirara> 07but he refused
<Kirara> 07:<
<Kirara> 07so much for having an opinion
<Quilava> :/
<Kirara> 07i wanted someone to give their tweaking opinions before i used it against you
<Quilava> hm
<Kirara> 07?
<Icydragon> *cynderpoke*

<Kirara> 07dunno
<Icydragon> 12Yeah! Why? Ya miss me?
<Kirara> 07i think this strategy might be a bit... redundant
<Kirara> 07like i usually do
<Cynder7> 6When I was on earlier and could stay on for a while,you wheren't there.. D:
<Quilava> the strategy is to win?
<Cynder7> 6Now I have like five mins.. >.<
<Icydragon> 12Aww...
<Icydragon> 12*slaps*
<Kirara> 07the strategy if i get it out
<Kirara> 07is that i have no choice but to win
<Cynder7> 6*icyslapback*
<Kirara> 07if i get it out
<Kirara> 07the way i see it i demand more resources than you do for your hydra
<Cynder7> 6Chicken? :3
<Icydragon> 12Yes please. :3
<Quilava> actually I made a few edits that make it so I can play my hydra with low start counters
*Cynder7 6gives e-chicken to Icy.
<Quilava> and still do good

<Icydragon> 12Well, she's the only one that takes my bullshit...
<Icydragon> 12*cynderpoke*
<Kirara> 07which a couple of them were deleted
<Kirara> 07but i understood why and knew they would probably get deleted before they were
*Aerieza waves
<Kirara> 07dunno i'll probably scrap this one deck
<Kirara> 07because it really is redundant
<Cyndar7> 6Shizz.
<Cyndar7> 6Why'd my webcam open? o.o
<Icydragon> 12Cause you opened it?
<Icydragon> 12*slapscyndar*

<Stormy> :D
<Kjakings> 7if he mentions something to do with a bed or a closet, run away
<Neon> Stormy's under attack by the Cyber Police.
<Stormy> D: what?
<nintendofreak> good tip
<Neon> The cyber Police... they have been called...
<Kjakings> 7They found out what you like to do on omegle
<Stormy> What's Omegle again?
<Neon> Chat Roulette but with text.
<Stormy> Oh
<Neon> Now they support video.
<Neon> But they are known for the text.
<Stormy> Fuuuun
<Stormy> I've been on there once
<Neon> It actually can be /very/ fun.
<Kjakings> 7indeed
<Stormy> I said "hi"
<Neon> Sometimes as good as prank calling.
<Stormy> The other person said "hi"
<Stormy> and then they left
<Stormy> :P
<Neon> No "aslaslasl!!!!"
<Kjakings> 7I like being Troy McClure and coming to talk to them on the subject of statuatory rape
<Neon> xD
<Neon> I was a 68-year-old female cat hoarder.
<Neon> That did not halt the guy in the slightest from cybering without my consent.
<Stormy> ......
<Stormy> Wow
<Neon> I know. xD
<Icydragon> 12<.<
<Icydragon> 12Thanks for ruining it...
<Kjakings> 7XD
<Neon> Then I told him that I never have relations with a man unless I get my cats' opinion.
<Stormy> XDDD
<Neon> Therefore, he would have to you know... mate with the cat.
<Stormy> O_o
<Neon> Just to get the jump on things.
<Stormy> And what did he say about that?
<Neon> "nah i dont do cats."
<Neon> But he was "very experienced" he said. xD
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> Not with cats, I hope
<Neon> But not everyone on Omegle is a creep.
<Neon> Just the entertaining ones.

<Steve> 13 Kjakings and Steve are 70% in love.
<Kirara> 07i think Sanguine Bond and Corrupt would be scary together
<Kjakings> 7:O
<Quilava> what're those?
<Kirara> 07Sanguine Bond is an enchantment that says whenever you gain life
<Kirara> 07your opponent loses that much life
<Kjakings> @lovemetere Stormy TLoS
<Steve> 13 Stormy and TLoS are 87% in love.
<Drake> 04Hi Skylands *late*
<Kirara> 07Corrupt is a card that says that you target a player or creature
<Stormy> XD
*Skylands waves to Drake
<Kirara> 07and corrupt deals damage to that target for each swamp you have in play
<Neon> D: I thought what we had was special, TLoS!
<Kirara> 07then you gain that much life
<Kjakings> @lovemeter Stormy Cynder
<Steve> 13 Stormy and Cynder are 82% in love.
<Neon> Dun dun duuuuun.
<Stormy> ._.
<Kirara> 07so if you have 10 swamps in play you pretty much say "okay deal 10 damage to you, i gain 10 life, okay you can lose 10 more life because i gained 10 life
<Kirara> 07"
*Stormy was not aware of being in love with a female dragon
<Kjakings> it was more of the concept of Cynder rather than the character
<Neon> Lawl, are you calling her pansexual?
*Stormy wasn't aware of being in love with the concept of a dragon either
<Kjakings> I'm sorry, you lost me
<Kirara> 07i'd probably play like 3 Sanguine Bond

<Aristeo> ~There, you see her! Sitting there across teh way!~
<Kjakings> wat is this i dont even
<Kirara> 07Tendrils of Corruption is pretty much the same thing as Corrupt but it costs less and can only target creatures
<Aristeo> ~She dun have a lot to say, but there's something abouuuuuuuuut herrrrrrrr~
<Aristeo> :3
<Neon> im 12 years old and what is this

<Steve> 13 Stormy and that_Raven_one_who_sent_her_the_love_letter are 2% in love.
<Kirara> 07it still works effectively with Sanguine Bond though, okay i deal like 5 damage to that creature and destroy it, i gain 5 life, you lose 5 life
<Aristeo> It's funny because they're going out in real life and it says 3% :3
<Stormy> Oh yeah, I remember that

<Aristeo> Now it all makes sense
<Stormy> Not the raven we know
<Stormy> Someone from Neoseeker
<Neon> Ah. The one who qouths things.
<Kjakings> also, Neon, do you own Gmod?
<Stormy> I think it was actually BlackFalcon
<Neon> No, ma'am.
<Stormy> Or something similar to that
<Kjakings> .... ma'am?
*Neon nods.
<Kjakings> even in the military, women are referred to as 'sir.' So I'm either some kind of Queen, Empress, Prime Minister or President
<Stormy> Or a customer that Neon is obligated to respect
<Kjakings> true
<Neon> Hahaha, yep.
<Kjakings> ah [censored]. My ship is getting its ass kicked on sunrise
<Kjakings> brb
<Neon> Kjakings: You're getting your azz kicked into the sunrise.
<Icydragon> 12Basement nintendofreak...
<Neon> So, now Aicebo and I are going to be moderators on OFF. xD
<Kjakings> hah. Aicebo a mod on anything.
<Kjakings> also, OFF?
<Neon> Owl Fantasy Forum. No, it is not a form of furry site. xD
<Kjakings> really? because that sounds like furnial
<Neon> Or feathery, whatever the ones who like aviaries are.
<nintendofreak> no!
<Neon> You sound like furnial.
<Kjakings> that was a well timed remark to try and divert the conversation away from you. unfortunately, you forget who you are dealing with
<Stormy> Aristeo, were we going to get that epic-chat forum set up?
<Icydragon> 12Yes! D:<
<Neon> I'm ready to argue my case, it's just that yours is based on the title of the forum.
<Neon> That and I haven't displayed any furry tendencies.
<Kjakings> true.
<Stormy> yeah, I really can't see Neon being a furry
<Kjakings> besides an odd obsession with owls
<Neon> Lol, even when I joined at 13 I wasn't obsessed with owls.
<Neon> And still amn't.
<Neon> Yeah, don't you like my contraction?
<Kjakings> XD amn't
<Stormy> Being on a forum about something hardly automatically qualifies you as obsessed
<Neon> Being on three forums for something.
<Neon> May qualfy.
<Neon> *qualify
<Stormy> Are you on three owl forums?
<Stormy> :P
<Kjakings> On a related note. I've invented my own language. It's identical to english except 'awesomer' and 'irregardless' are words and '-izzle' is a more common suffix
<Kjakings> plus, you and Aicebo started that mini war with that other owl guy over his abuse of the owls or some [censored] like that
<Stormy> So would "irregardless" be the opposite of "regardless"?
<Kjakings> yes
<Neon> Stormy: No, haha.
<Kjakings> also, there's a midpoint between 'overwhelmed' and 'underwhelmed'
<Neon> Can we also put in 'unclarity'?
<Neon> I was thinking todat that this should be a word.
<Neon> *today
<Kjakings> sure why the [censored] not
<Neon> Argh, I actually have plans.
<Neon> Gotta go, peoplez.
<Neon> Tell Lambda I said hi, Stormy.
<Stormy> Will do

<Quilava> they would both take effect so I don't see why it wouldn't
<Kirara> 07yeah
<Kirara> 07getting more than 2 out though would be asking for much
<Kirara> 07since Sanguine Bond takes 5 to cast

<Light_Latias> wb
<Drake> 04wb PS
<PokemonStar> Thanks
<PokemonStar> Sorry
*PokemonStar fumes
<Light_Latias> and lol
<Drake> 04and here I was hoping for a good replacement for the HG/SS overworlds
<PokemonStar> The picture I was working on.. All gone...
<Drake> 04D:
<Light_Latias> D:
<PokemonStar> Anyone have any ideas to fix a mouse? My mouse doesn't seem to be working properly.
<Drake> 04no, sorry
<Drake> 04well hey, at least these Mismagius sprites are better than the HG/SS ones
<Light_Latias> feed it cheese?
*Light_Latias flees
<Drake> 04LL, that wouldn't work, take it to the vet
*Drake hides
<PokemonStar> Wow, thanks guys >>
*PokemonStar gets enough of that at school
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> PS: Depends on what the problem with the mouse is
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Chances are you'll need a new one
<Light_Latias> srry, Pokestar :<
<PokemonStar> Yeah
<Drake> 04sorry PS, just trying to make light of the situation
<PokemonStar> People make the joke whenever someone says, "OMG, did you draw that?!" "No, she traced it." "Oh, how uncool."
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Drake> 04people say that to me when I draw at school
<Drake> 04I could care less
<PokemonStar> It makes me mad >>
<PokemonStar> "How is your tracing coming along?"
<Drake> 04why? Unless you care about your rep at school then I wouldn't give a damn
<PokemonStar> People insulted my art for their own fun
<PokemonStar> That just makes me mad, but whatever
<Drake> 04insult whatever they do
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Ah immaturity, I learnt to ignore all that bluushit in school
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> bull*
<Drake> 04insult their clothes, their looks, whatever
<PokemonStar> >>
<Drake> 04or just humor them
<PokemonStar> Mah
<PokemonStar> Meh*
<Light_Latias> some people know of nothing better to do -.-
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> ^
<Drake> 04what I find really odd is that people go "Hey Drake" and I reply "Hey" and they laugh
<Drake> 04I honestly do not get it
<Drake> 04are they expecting me to ignore them or something?
<PokemonStar> Some people are just stupid
<PokemonStar> Most of the time I tend to ignore people who say things to me (unless I know them)
<Drake> 04If someone says hi, I reply. But if I know they're out to get me I ignore them
<Light_Latias> good idea :)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Anything related too immaturity I tend to ignore, unless I'm having a muck around myself
<Light_Latias> @Pokestar
*PokemonStar hmms
<PokemonStar> Yeah, I'll have to get a new mouse, then restart my drawing
<Drake> 04:<

<Drake> 04why don't YOU try finding a good gun when you've got who knows how many foreign soldiers crawling all over your city, guns at the ready and prepared to shoot you
<Blazaking> I will
<Blazaking> Where does this take place

<Blazaking> Please say Russia
<Drake> 04lolno
<Drake> 04not Russia
<Blazaking> Where
<Blazaking> Who is invading
<Drake> 04the movie never says exactly where, but the soldiers are Asian
<Blazaking> ...
<Drake> 04so my bet its China or Japan
<Blazaking> Ok uh
<Blazaking> It's not Japan
<Blazaking> Because they suck at war
<Drake> 04lol
<Blazaking> So it's either China or North Korea
<Drake> 04tell that to the people who suffered at Pearl Harbour
<Blazaking> I will
<Blazaking> And they'll say
<Blazaking> YO THEN WE FUCKED THEM UP
<Blazaking> AND NUKED THEM
<Blazaking> TWICE
<Blazaking> And then the radiation made the rest of them born with small dicks
<Blazaking> So it works out

<Blazaking> And you already have an M24
<Blazaking> So you could pick off some foot mobiles

<Skylands> 10Sentret is Yoshino?
*LaptopAristeo yawns
<Drake> 04yah
*Skylands would have never guessed
<LaptopAristeo> Did you know that drowning in fluids that are not water is rare?
<Skylands> 10until I saw
<Skylands> 10[19:38] <Drake> hullo Yoshino
<Drake> 04well Yoshino is obsessed with sentrets from what I know
<Drake> 04besides she's been here before
<Skylands> 10She's usually not on when I am
<mib_1xb2yn> Well...duh
*Skylands pokes timezones
<Drake> 04ah yes
<Drake> 04those things
<Skylands> 10They must die
<Soyuz> or you must move
<Soyuz> either way; DOOOOOMSDAAAAY
<LaptopAristeo> No duh :(
*LaptopAristeo cries
*LaptopAristeo points to nitrogen, which is one thing you can drown in
*mib_1xb2yn rolls his eys
<mib_1xb2yn> How often are you ever near liquid nitrogen
<mib_1xb2yn> and in great enough quantities to drown yourself in
<Skylands> 10Ew, 2012 end of world-believers.
<LoopyDood> Great enough quantities to drown yorself without suffering from a severe case of collapsed lung first
<Drake> 04bring it
<Drake> 04I've survived who knows how many other apocalyptic doomsday movies, this one can't be any worse
*Drake hides
<Skylands> 10That's almost like my sig on dA
<sentret> 4lol
<Skylands> 10"I have survived everything this world has to offer. 2012, I'm on my way."
<Drake> 04XD
<LaptopAristeo> mib_1xb2yn: Did I say liquid?
<sentret> 4i watched the movie
<LaptopAristeo> fluids and liquids are not the same thing >:|
<sentret> 4its weird
<sentret> 4i mean
<sentret> 4like
<sentret> 4the guy and his family gets on a plane
<sentret> 4where would you go if the world would supposedly end? o3o
<LoopyDood> Is it really drowning if it's not liquid?
<sentret> 4and in the end methinks they're in the ocean... or something
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<Skylands> 10the movie was not-so-good
<mib_1xb2yn> ^
<LaptopAristeo> :o
<mib_1xb2yn> And usually nitrogen is in a gaseous form
<sentret> 4they survived anyway
<LaptopAristeo> That's kind of a poetic question :3
<sentret> 4well
<sentret> 4there is a chance o3o
<LaptopAristeo> It's like.....
<LaptopAristeo> Is it really love if it hath not withstood the test of time?
*Skylands could see a sequel in the near future
<sentret> 4LOL
<LoopyDood> I would think of it as suffocating due to lack of oxygen... it's not like a gas will cause your lungs to seize up like a liquid
<sentret> 4it'll be called
<sentret> 4 621365035
<Skylands> 10probably AFTER Dec. 21, 2012 is over

<sentret> 4and in HGSS, Red wasn't as hard as i though he would be
<sentret> 4i beat his snorlax with my lv 50 articuno
<Sneas> Lolinternalbattery
<Skylands> 10I thought Red was insanely hard
<sentret> 4got lucky by freezing it
*Skylands had to bring over her Platinum team
<sentret> 4and then spammed ice beams
<Skylands> 10That's how bad it was for me
<sentret> 4plus the hail effect
<sentret> 4lol
<Skylands> 10Speaking of that, I still need to finish HG
<sentret> 4i beat it with mainly 3 pokemon
<Sneas> They should have made Red all lvl 100.
<sentret> 4my typhlosion, ampharos and articuno ;>
<Skylands> 10No D:
*Sneas runs
<Skylands> 10@Sneas

<Skylands> 10Platinum, mostly level 90s

<Ray> 02hi feather
<Quanyails> 7Small question about the site:
<Feather> 10hi Ray
<Quanyails> 7Does the art galleries automatically log you out after some time?
<Quanyails> 7Do*
<Glacymr> 12hi Articuno
<Glacymr> 12hi brawl master Feather
<Articuno> 12Yes they do
<Articuno> 12It's annoying, you have to logout and back i
<Articuno> 12n
<Kirara> 07i'm not going to host a tournament with less than 8 people

<Feather> 10hi Glacymr
<Chimera> ...x3
<Chimera> And lol brawl master
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Chimera> Glacymr, I'm not THAT good
<Glacymr> 12we'll see about that later Chimera
<Glacymr> 12:P
<Chimera> I'm a brawl DEVELOPER in TRAINING :3
*Chimera hides
<Glacymr> 12whatever happened to that IRC script
<Chimera> ?
<Glacymr> 12where a bot would annouce that someone made a post in the forums
<Chimera> Heh
<Caaz> >.>
<Chimera> Maybe it would somewhat spam the chat? :P
<Caaz> Tournament.
<Caaz> For what.
<Quanyails> 7How did that bot even work? O.o
<Chimera> Um
<Chimera> In theory I'd guess it'd check the fourm server?
<Chimera> Like, it would ping it or something...? o.o
<Airwolf> that sounds like something which would have to be integrated into the server hosting the forum
<Chimera> Yah
<Glacymr> 12could be
<Airwolf> unless there's a quick way to check on the site if there's a new post
<Glacymr> 12it was quite a long time ago
<Glacymr> 12maybe it wasn't even posts
<Glacymr> 12my memory is fuzzy
<Airwolf> actually since there's recent posts at the bottom I could probably actually write an mIRC script to check every now and again, remember what it last saw, and announce new posts.
<Airwolf> sounds like a fun challenge actually, where's the bot ...
<Articuno> 12<Quanyails> No way of keeping it logged in? :/ <---- Yes but Lugia has no time
<Quanyails> 7All right, then. I'll deal with it for now. ^_^
<Quanyails> !define earlock

*Espeon now belongs to Ripred for 15 minutes
<Espeon> Like 85% of all "controversial" things in the world today.
<May> I bet they burn the American flag all the time, but we aren't outraged
<Espeon> hurr durrp attention
<May> and I'm sure there is knowledge of it
*Espeon now belongs to (Ripred)
<Ripred> 2.-.
<Ripred> 2FOREVER
<Espeon> lol after those caricatures of Muhammad (sp?) they burned the flag of Denmark ... quite a lot to say the least.
<Espeon> But well, people gotta think through the possible consequences of their actions.
*May is not amused by the media
<Espeon> That would make the world a better place |3

<HyperMetalLugia> 2Yeah,all the cubes were destryoyed....:(

<Ray> 02:[
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Those poor cubes, you never had the chance to even touch them...or use them!
<Ray> 02yes... that makes me sad
<Airwolf> wheee
<Airwolf> probably want to put a limiter in there
<Airwolf> Corei7s sure can spam when bad code rears its head
<HyperMetalLugia> 2What are you talking about?
<Airwolf> experimental script to be used for checking for new forum posts went mental
<Airwolf> it spammed several thousand messages in approximmately an instant
<Airwolf> so the server killed it
<Airwolf> (this experimentation is going on in another channel which is why it is not visible
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Ouch...
<HyperMetalLugia> 2At least your computer did not freez
<Airwolf> it'd take more than that to kill off this thing
<Airwolf> this can still do normal tasks while Blender eats 100% of all eight cores
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Blender...?
<Airwolf> http://www.blender.org/
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Oh well, my Core i7 860 is a bit too powerful for me
<Airwolf> rendering high-detail and high-quality settings takes a LOT of power
<Airwolf> I don't know how 860s perform, but this 920 is insane, especially with overclocking
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I think it's about the same, or better
<HyperMetalLugia> 2It's the 1168? pin model
<Airwolf> the 9X0's use 1366 pin
<Airwolf> this's powerful enough that Fallout 3 lags less when restricted to two cores rather than being allowed to use its inbuilt limit of four. Running four the threads start tripping each other up and it causes lag
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Extra cores don't mean more power, it's up to the coding.
<Chimera> Mrr
<HyperMetalLugia> 2http://www.anandtech.com/show/2839/2 It's about the same
<Airwolf> FO3 is designed to be able to utilise four, but when they're fast enough they end up trying to access menory simultaneously and do other dodgy things, which is why performance is better with only two (less clashing)
<Airwolf> *m
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Hopefully newer games take advatage of those cores...
<Airwolf> 800 series I believe is probably designed to be a lower power and cheaper alternative to the 900's, since yours is a high-end 800 it explains why they match fairly closely. Mine'll get better scores as theirs is stock at 2.66 GHz, whereas I overclock to 3.6-4 GHz.
<Airwolf> which miiiiight be what broke the last PSU
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I can't overclock (Dell Vostro, with a 350 watt psu)
<Airwolf> either that or the dust. Yay for non-reversible fans being set up as suction while at the bottom of the case
<HyperMetalLugia> 2And I don't need too...
<Airwolf> I only have use of OC'ing because of Blender, which can and will use ridiculous amounts of processing power if available
<Airwolf> and told to
<Airwolf> it will quite happily put a 4-CPU, 6-core-per-CPU desktop to 100% load if told to
<Airwolf> 24 cores fully loaded
<HyperMetalLugia> 2What?
<HyperMetalLugia> 2You have that?
<Ray> 02random topic: chuck norris vs GLaDOS
<HyperMetalLugia> 2GLAdNorris
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Glanorris
<Airwolf> Nope, but the way it's coded it can utilise as many threads as are available, and such desktops are available for the right price
<HyperMetalLugia> 2What about those Supercomputers?
<Airwolf> also, it's entertaining how AMD's X4 965 at 3.4 GHz loses to the 2.66 GHz i7 920 by a significant margin
<Airwolf> and it can probably do a decent amount of load on a supercomputer too
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Next topic- HyperThreading or Not? (4vs8 cores)
<Airwolf> code's not optimised for them, and whatever its absurdly high thread-counter can reach miiiight be less than the number of cores in a supercomputer, but it could put a decent load on them
<Ray> 02Deja-bu
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Deja-Tu
<Airwolf> I use HT. having it enabled reduces the performance of an individual core, but I'm not sure how much, and the gain from the four extra is with decent coding always more than the loss
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Though I never see the 4 virtual cores used up... (Only HyperPi can do that)
<Airwolf> there'll be a benefit from the extra cores in situations like a program that supports quad-core, and wants to fully load them
<Airwolf> since it leaves four cores untouched and other programs can be offloaded onto those
*HyperMetalLugia 2boots up HyperPi
*HyperMetalLugia 2sets it up to 7cores, with 1Million Digits and A YT video running

<HyperMetalLugia> Oh...

<HyperMetalLugia> 2Well Boo HooZ!
<KyroTheAssassin> :O i LOVE the Wii!
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Mii too!
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Nintendo is losing all decent games
<Espeon> The Wii can be fun, that's all it can be.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2It still like my Wii over the Ps2
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Espeon: If you with a group of people yeh
<Espeon> as in "Yay, I play vidya games by waving my hands around" fun.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Ahh...
<KyroTheAssassin> i like my 360 over myWii
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I will choose a PS2 over a Wii anyday
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I use the Classic controller/GC
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> And Kyro you got Xbox Live?
<KyroTheAssassin> nope
<SirKipi> 4The best Wii games usually aren't about waving your hands though
<Espeon> The Wii would be godly if it was released in the gen with the original Xbox/PS3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Fail
<Espeon> true Kipi
<SirKipi> 4With the exception of Zelda
<KyroTheAssassin> how am i supposed to get Live when i dont have fast internet?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> The Wii is only fun when you are with friends in my opinion
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> On your own it kinda sucks :\
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I always have more fun by myself!
<SirKipi> 4With the exception of Zelda
<SirKipi> 4:P
<Espeon> failbooru
<Andres> Sleeptime :o

<HyperMetalLugia> 2It's HIM
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Zelda on the Wii is truly horrid
<Espeon> oh I thought the range of ircip2.mibbit.com was banned

<HyperMetalLugia> 2It's mirrored
<INVADER_TODD> 3Hi guys

<INVADER_TODD> 3I'm sorry for what Num said
<KyroTheAssassin> hi
*HyperMetalLugia 2Liked WindWaker more
<KyroTheAssassin> Wind Waker was THEE best Zelda game they made
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I didn't really like Wind Waker
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> OoT was my favourite
<Espeon> Ocarina of Time
<Espeon> ..

<Articuno> 12Mhm
<SirKipi> 4But then again, I'm a bigger fan towards the old school top-down Zelda games than the full 3D ones.
<INVADER_TODD> 3Guys, Num is coming back... heheheheh....
<Articuno> 12Just let him try
<SirKipi> 4So... ALttP would be my favorite in the series, followed by OoA/T.

<Ray> 02i will give it to you
<MayART> he's able to be in the channel

<Ray> 02There is a new blayblade game coming this fall LOL
*Quanyails 7read that as keyblade. ._.
<Ray> 02beyblade*
<Espeon> lol smashboards. But mindgames are better than bawwing over the fact there's people who actually enjoy playing such ELITE GAEMS casually.
<Quanyails> 7But hey, BBS is coming out this fall. :P
<SirKipi> 4Are we supposed to be excited, Ray?
<Quanyails> 7Well, it came out.

<INVADER_TODD> 3Why my good friend was banned
<MayART> Quan
<SirKipi> 4I guess
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Oh boy...
<MayART> you entered Roara's contest, right?
<HyperMetalLugia> 2So many loong waiting times
<Ray> 02<INVADER_TODD> Why my good friend was banned <--- because of being a spamer
<INVADER_TODD> 3Yeah, she told me
<INVADER_TODD> 3-_-
<MayART> no not for being a spammer only
<MayART> IT, your friend happens to be a real big jerk to us
*HyperMetalLugia 2goes to his happy cave...
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Ray> 02agree
<KyroTheAssassin> isnt that in the rules something about being an "excessive spammer"?
<MayART> that's why she was banned
*KyroTheAssassin doesnt remember
<Glacymr> 12i can't answer that
*SirKipi 4coughs up a lolball.
<Espeon> Your "friend" basically came in here and called everyone oversensitive retards without lives.
<Espeon> Therefore he was banned.
<INVADER_TODD> 3Oi, she's joking!
<HyperMetalLugia> 2ORLY
<Espeon> And now, fish.
<MayART> well
<MayART> we don't take joking like that here
<MayART> that's just plain out rude
<LaptopAristeo> I dunno
<KyroTheAssassin> exactly
<Glacymr> 12joking or not there are limits
<LaptopAristeo> Seemed like a good idea at the time
<Sartre> ...
<Ray> 02agree
<Glacymr> 12to what people can take
<HyperMetalLugia> 2With Nettiquitw
<SirKipi> 4It's kinda hard to insult people you've never met and claim it was a joke... successfully.
<Glacymr> 12it's a lesson i have to learn the hard way over and over again
<INVADER_TODD> 3AAAAAARGH!
<MayART> IT
<INVADER_TODD> 3I dunno who to be mad at!

<Sneas> buy qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm mugs, tshirts and magnets
<Sneas> A phenomena that happens to a computer's keyboard when a human being is bored to death...
<Sneas> Bored to death in a cube a human decides to type qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm (all the keyboard buttons in an orderly way) to a search engine to see what comes up. Then finds definitions for it and then adds a new one...
<MayART> but, Syrynn, that was 'cause of personal reasons
<Syrynn> Skeptical Shaymin does NOT approve. D:
<ixr> Thats my job
<MayART> I'm sorry ;~;

<Anareta> bah
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7And yes, DRF.
<Crevan> 4one person has already added skylands to favourites
<Anareta> this Chat
<Icydragon> 12*kisses*
<Syrynn> Merf, none of the RPs look interesting to me... 3: I have some sort of exotic taste, it seems...
<drfsupercenter> 03so in other words, a mix-CD
*drfsupercenter runs
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7No, not music artists.
<Anareta> o3o
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Like, art artists.
<Anareta> gah
*Crevan made drf one to
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just kidding
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o OK
<ixr> "embraces"
<Crevan> 4:P
*Anareta will just have this name for now kthx
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Crevan> 4they're are all on my DA Jacob-Sorrow
*Crevan skips around merrily
<Anareta> speaking of DA
<Anareta> and speaking of art
<Anareta> ROARA
<Anareta> how do you do transparent backgrounds?
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Anareta: What program do you use?
<Anareta> Sai
<Icydragon> 12>:3
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Which starts off with a transparent slate, right?
*Anareta prods Syrynn
<Anareta> no
<Anareta> blank
<Anareta> white
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7o3o
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Well, I wish I knew more about SAI.

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/547fd9628ad14cd15f8cc06069c6d28d.gif
<drfsupercenter> 03that
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Crevan; the card you make need a lot of work.
*Raine is freezing
*Anareta squeaks
<Crevan> 4ya this basic design for ones i will be making
<Icydragon> 12Hmhmhm...
*Syrynn does a Skymin-d'awww and snuggles.
<Spyrorocks> Get out of the Raine !!!
<ixr> Rawr...
<Icydragon> 12Rawr back at ya.
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Crevan; really, they're extremely unprofessional and unrealistic.
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Buuuuuuuut, I suppose I can just let it slide.
<Crevan> 4thank you for the criticsism
<ixr> ;P
*Raine glares at Spyro
*Crevan i not being sarcastic
<Crevan> 4is
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7ô.o
*Spyrorocks giggles from his bad joke
<Crevan> 4i know i need to work on them and make them more realistic
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7A tip for pixel art, and well, other art that's not vector art; don't resize them up.
<varchld> I thought that was good :x
*Syrynn purrs against Ana and yawns, falling asleep. +1 rare ability to keep Skymin form 24/7 is awesome. ((Nini~))
<Crevan> 4I didn't resize any but 1 by accident
*Spyrorocks 's moral is boosted by varchld 's comment
<ixr> "licks cheek"
<Raine> you mean ego..
<Raine> and be careful or you won't be able to pass through the door
<Aurora> 6DUDE
<Aurora> 6I just remembered something
<Aurora> 6that applies to drf
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Okay, well, that's a tip for next time.
<Icydragon> 12*licks neck*
<Crevan> 4but ya i really need to fix them up to better standard
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7I find it okay to scale down an image.
<Aurora> 6so these two kids in my class were talking
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7But scaling up distorts it.
<SheenaFox> kids?
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Also, stats; 999999... of something a good card does not make.
<Aurora> 6the girl said something, and then said the guy needs to say "that's what she said " after it
<Aurora> 6kids as in.....teens, 18 year old probably
<Aurora> 6anyways, the guy said "why would I say that?"
<ixr> "moans"
<Aurora> 6the girl "because you have to"
<Aurora> 6the guy "I'm not 12"
<Crevan> 4the pokemaker app is an app to make unrealistic or realistic cards
<Aurora> 6drf therefore, is 12
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Ah, an app?
<Crevan> 4yep
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7As an Apple application? (Alliteration!)
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<drfsupercenter> 03and hm
<Crevan> 4for touch ipad and iphone

<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03they do make out in front of me

<Chimbreon> Um
<Chimbreon> Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Chimbreon> Well kissing isn't a crime
<Umbreon> 12i love how the only character who speaks in brawl is snake
<drfsupercenter> 03Arjun has a different room and the door closes
<Chimbreon> And some people don't find it gross
<Chimbreon> And no Umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03earlier the two of them were in there with the door closed
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimbreon, that's not the point. Making out when someone else is in the room is uncalled for regardless if you think it's gross or not
<Chimbreon> Fox, Falco, Sonic, Falcon (kinda xD), etc

<Lyon> 04besides, everyone matures at different rates

<Aurora> 6do want
<Espeon> oh my
<Espeon> |3
<Aurora> 6I've seen another variation of those, but THOSE
<Espeon> win
<Espeon> So yes
<Espeon> Breeons
<Aurora> 6BREEEEEEEEEEEES
<Aurora> 6yes
<Espeon> they are fun
<Aurora> 6I have plans for a bree plush
<Aurora> 6but I dunno if I should seeing how long it took me to make the other plushes
<Espeon> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
<Aurora> 6http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=umbreon+plush#/d24b6jn more lifelike than that, but this demanded to be posted
<Espeon> wtf it doesn't want to load D:
<Espeon> But when it does
<Aurora> 6http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs46/f/2009/184/a/2/Standing_Umbreon_Plush_by_usako_chan.jpg
<Aurora> 6try that
<Aurora> 6I wasn't planning on making a life-size bree
<Espeon> Oh hai
<Aurora> 6because....it's huge
<Aurora> 6but
<Espeon> those ears |3
<Espeon> Lifesize = snuggle size
<Espeon> eeee
<Aurora> 6seeing one on DA made me think a lifesize bree would be cool
<Espeon> It definitely would.
<Aurora> 6but see
<Airwolf> umbreon wasn't that big last I checked
<Aurora> 6umbreon is 3'3"
<Aurora> 6that's HUGE
<Aurora> 6I thought it was 2' at max
<Aurora> 6http://asteria-the-light.deviantart.com/art/umbreon-lifesize-2-150713633
<Aurora> 6lifesize seems even TOO big to cudlle
<Aurora> 6cuddle
<Airwolf> height to the shoulder or length?
<Aurora> 6height probably to the head
<Aurora> 6pokemon doesn't measure to shoulder
<Espeon> lol
<Airwolf> because it didn't look that tall in what I remember of the anime
<Aurora> 6yeah that's what I said....
<Espeon> direct link thing to the second one pls .-.
<Aurora> 6http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/017/5/d/umbreon_lifesize_2_by_Asteria_the_light.jpg
<Airwolf> and you don't measure quadrupeds to the head; that height varies too readily to give an accurate result (bending neck down/up etc)
<Hawkie> LOL
<Hawkie> then how
<Hawkie> doe you
<Espeon> That's not too big
<Espeon> :U
<Hawkie> measure a giraffe
<Hawkie> z.z
<Espeon> Just make it softer an...
<Espeon> LOL
<Airwolf> I was just thinking that
<Airwolf> shoulder and neck separate numbers maybe?
<Aurora> 6ok well if its being measured to the shoulder, then that's 3'3" to the shoulder
<Aurora> 6a couple inches more for the head lol
<Aurora> 6BASICALLY
<Aurora> 6that's huge
<Hawkie> oO
<Espeon> heh
<Airwolf> way bigger than it ever looked
<Aurora> 6yeah, he should be about 2', maybe 2'6"
<Foo> ffff
<Airwolf> lawlfoo
<Aurora> 6lol
<Airwolf> Hawkie issa foo'!
<DarkRockShooter> Yo foo'!
<Hawkie> Bah!
<Hawkie> LOL
<Aurora> 6Tagami: I designed Tsutaaja. After that, the Little Pigeon Pokemon Mamepato <-this artist is my friend now
<Aurora> 6and it looks to be about 150-170 new pokemanz
<Espeon> lol
<Aurora> 6once again we designed a mouse-like Pokemon, a dog-like Pokemon, etc. from scratch. <-dog
<Aurora> 6DOG
<Airwolf> is that the biggest gen do far?
<Airwolf> *so
<Aurora> 6if it's 170, then yes
<Aurora> 6it was a rough estimate
<Espeon> dog-like != dog
<Espeon> |3
<Aurora> 6still
<Aurora> 6close enough
<Airwolf> Dog-like !!!!!!!!= cat.
<Airwolf> anyway which was this referring to?
<Aurora> 6there's an entire section here of the interview about tsutaaja |D
<Aurora> 6the interview with some of the people in charge of creating the new pokemon
<Airwolf> Tsutaaja looks like a nerd
<Aurora> 6NO
<Aurora> 6D:<
<Aurora> 6oh no
<Airwolf> Professor Araragi
<Airwolf> I wonder if they're aware of who else is called Araragi ...
<Cynder7> 6ICY!!
<Cynder7> 6*icyhug*
<Aurora> 6Oomura: I said, “How about a sea otter for the Water-type?” But if a sea otter were to evolve, what would it become? That’s where I hit a wall. Eventually I said that if a sea otter was to evolve, it would transform into something completely different. [Note: The third rumored evolution of Mijumaru from a few days ago looks completely different than Mijumaru.
<Aurora> 6from the interview
<Aurora> 6that note being pokebeach's writing
<Espeon> I'd rather just wait and see what comes.
<Espeon> I already have 0 expectations so |3
<Aurora> 6pretty much that lol

<Aurora> 6famitsu's rating took me surprise

<Airwolf> Did they finally realise Pokeyman doesn't offer anything new generation to generation
<Airwolf> ?
<Kjakings> 7*cynderhug*
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Aurora> 6no, they gave a perfect score
<Aurora> 6which only 14 other games in history have recieved
<Espeon> I'm still skeptical xD
<Aurora> 6including Ocarina of Time, SSBB, and yeh
<Aurora> 6same but
<Aurora> 6there HAS TO BE A REASON
<Espeon> LOL WTF
<Espeon> SSBB got perfect score?
<Espeon> madness
<Aurora> 6yep
<Aurora> 6and Twilight Princess wasn't even on the "close" list
<Aurora> 6oh wair
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6here's an actual head count
<Aurora> 6 153 pokemon
<Airwolf> SSBB has no appeal to me so I just say bleh@ it having a perfect score
<Aurora> 6that is the biggest
<Aurora> 6er
<Aurora> 6*156
<Espeon> the people who score gaems there must be sorta crazy.
<Airwolf> by five I'm guessing?
<Hawkie> fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive
<Hawkie> o3o
<Hawkie> five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five
<Airwolf> fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire
*Hawkie explodes
<Airwolf> *boom headshot*
<Aurora> 6only 3 are events, two of which we know (victini and zoroark)
<Ray> 02hi from the airport
<Ray> 02hi aurora!
<Aurora> 6first PURE FLYING tpe
<Aurora> 6and it's a legendary o-o
<Aurora> 6legendary trio are fighting types
<Aurora> 6with their secondary types of course
<Airwolf> you mean there's not been a pure flying yet?
<Aurora> 6er.....wait
<Aurora> 6now i'm confused
<Aurora> 6there's that trio
<Aurora> 6and then there's another flying trio
<Ray> 02o3o
<Airwolf> two trios?
<Aurora> 6but reshiram and zekrom appear to be place in between the flying types, separating them by number
<Airwolf> a hexo then?
<Aurora> 6another flying/electric legend
<Aurora> 6another flying/ground
<Aurora> 6THIS one earns respect: dragon/ice
<Aurora> 6wait....
<Airwolf> stop saying wait, it makes things explode.
<Aurora> 6sorry LOL
<Aurora> 6I was reading all of this
<Aurora> 6all these are legendaries...
<Aurora> 6A LOT of legendaries
<Aurora> 6 12
<Airwolf> are there 147 legendaries?
<Chimera> mrrrr~

<Ray> 02... hey aurora i got i problem... i can't login to the forums o3o
<Aurora> 6so it still has the most
<Espeon> wtf internet
<Aurora> 6but 12 is huge
<Aurora> 6also
<Aurora> 6zoroark isn't going to be event specific I guess
<Ray> 02a problem*
<Aurora> 6if it is, serebii needs to recount their estimate
<Aurora> 6Ray, what does it do?
<Airwolf> I have no idea where to get any legendaries other than the main 4/5 in DPP
<Ray> 02he says that im alredy logged in o3o

<Hawkie> LOL
<Airwolf> if you use Aero then (at least in win7) you can shake a window to minimise all others
<Airwolf> interestingly one window survived but that's probably because it has a selection dialog open

<Airwolf> should I extend that to auto-check and repost new posts?
<Kipi> Maybe you should do what you want
<Airwolf> I just did that as a challenge when someone wondered where the post-reporting bot went
<Kipi> But of course
<Kipi> Good thing I don't feel like working on my essay, but there's no other classwork to do since I already finished Math, I only have to read for CPD150, and I've yet to get my book for Renassance Art.

<Airwolf> o.o
<Airwolf> let's fix that
<Obsi> BUG!
<Kipi> #spamtemple
<Obsi> I think you forgot a #ifdef somewhere in there (Just kidding I know it's not C)
<Airwolf> script shall be redirected to another channel until that obvious bug is fixed
<Airwolf> as well as any others
<Obsi> Airwolf, may I see the source of it? (send it to me in a zipfile along with mirc.hlp please)
<Obsi> I may be rusty on my MSL, but I'll take a crack at it
<Airwolf> I seem to have it fixed, was just a display formatting error (though I see one regex error which I should also be able to fix)
<Kipi> Class starts in 10 minutes
<Kipi> But I'll be getting out early today. :o
<Airwolf> it looks to work and not be spamming up the channel, so I'll redirect it here and add in a free-use command which will redirect it to the channel I'm using to test (as an emergency measure)
<Airwolf> to end spam in the case of error: 'spamstop
*Kipi yawns up a storm
<Airwolf> the testing would however be more effective if people posted
*Airwolf cough

<Airwolf> should I make it ignore forum games in that case? :P
<Umbreon> 12if that's possible

<Airwolf> well, the quotes would break it, but take those out and it's fine
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Umbreon> 07nothing
<Airwolf> that bit has been added so it should ignore forum games. Since that line there worked it looks like the only possible (and unlikely) error would be it still reporting forum games

<Umbreon> 07it made roara happy that i took the nick back
<Umbreon> 07anyway maybe with fur
*drfsupercenter punches Apple to not suck
<Umbreon> 07and scales under the fur, padded paws, about the size of an umbreon

<Feather> 10<_<..

<Umbreon> 12one of these days we are going to drive drf out of here
<Umbreon> 12by making apple appreciation week
<Feather> 10haha
<drfsupercenter> 03it's so great that it disconnects you every 10 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Feather> 10IT'S NOT THE IPOD
<Feather> 10It's the app
<drfsupercenter> 03and that location crap you needed help with when you got the thing?
<Feather> 10I could just buy a better one if I really wanted to
<drfsupercenter> 03that's definitely the iPOd
<Feather> 10I finally got it to work, just needed to fix something
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<drfsupercenter> 03that's fricking nonstandard
<drfsupercenter> 03All of my devices just detect the location automatically
<drfsupercenter> 03no putzing in router settings required

<Chimera> Feather
<Chimera> The wi-fi I have to say sucks
<Chimera> Trust me :|
<Chimera> In my own house I d/c so randomly
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03http://izismile.com/img/img3/20100909/files/1/mac_computer_01.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03read that if you want :P
<Chimera> that dang iPad my dad let us test cut our connection right next to the dang router
<Chimera> and my laptop?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Chimera
<Feather> 10I don't HAVE a mac
<drfsupercenter> 03even in the fricking Apple store
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried the iPad
<drfsupercenter> 03and it had like
<Chimera> I can have the laptop work upstairs
<drfsupercenter> 03dialup speed
<drfsupercenter> 03IN THE APPLE STORE
<Chimera> just fine
<Chimera> oh WOW
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "Who buys this crap?"
<drfsupercenter> 03then again so did the iPods :P
<Chimera> lucky for Steve the public is ignorant >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03<Feather> I don't HAVE a mac <- Regardless, Apple still overcharges massive amounts for what their products are worth, iPods included
<drfsupercenter> 03like wtf iPod Nano? Why is it $200? My 8GB Sansa was $50 and has like 10 more features
<Feather> 10I agree with that, but still
<Feather> 10You can't get anything like an iPod Touch anywhere else
<drfsupercenter> 03they might work if you don't care about wasting money
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes you can
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't I proven this before?
<Feather> 10And don't say the Android, that's a phone
<Umbreon> 12apple supports al gore more
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16855501044&cm_re=android-_-55-501-044-_-Product <- $40 less than the 32GB iPod Touch, has a built in GPS... etc
<Umbreon> 12microsoft doesn't care about the enviroment
<drfsupercenter> 03Feather, Android is an operating system
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid is the phone
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like saying Windows for a computer
<Umbreon> 12environment*
<Umbreon> 12the polar ice caps are going to melt because of microsoft D:
<Feather> 10I thought they were the same thing... Droid was just short for it LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid is Motorola Droid
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a phone
<drfsupercenter> 03Android has been around for years, the Google G1 was the first Android phone like what, 5 years ago?
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid was the first one on Verizon is all
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Feather> 10oh
<drfsupercenter> 03there's now a bunch
<drfsupercenter> 03Droid X, Droid 2, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03Motorola Backflip on AT&T
<drfsupercenter> 03Samsung Evo
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, there are touchscreen devices running Android that are cheaper than iPod Touches and do more :P
<Umbreon> 07:)
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL "touche"
<Feather> 10And that product you posted
<Feather> 10it's an internet tablet
<Feather> 10isn't it?
<drfsupercenter> 03how is that different than an iPod?
<drfsupercenter> 03it plays music...
<Feather> 10Game player
<Feather> 10plays music
<drfsupercenter> 03OK see
<Feather> 10internet
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just the generic named
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<drfsupercenter> 03It runs Android
<drfsupercenter> 03Which can play music, games, IRC, etc etc
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Feather> 10Probably not as much games as iPod
<drfsupercenter> 03I beg to differ
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.androlib.com/ <- take a look around there, that has all the apps for Android in a website that you can search
<drfsupercenter> 03I have emulators of all the classic game systems on my phone
<Feather> 10I could do the same with my iPod lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, I'm just saying there's plenty of stuff for Android
<drfsupercenter> 03it's one of the more underrated products
<drfsupercenter> 03luckily now that the phones are doing well more people know about it
<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/funny-facebook-surround-fai1.png LOL
<Chimera> meow

<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah
*Chimera sat on
<drfsupercenter> 03really the only reasons people like APple is the Reality Distortion Field
<drfsupercenter> 03that, and not knowing of the better products
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never *ever* seen a TV ad for the Sansa
<drfsupercenter> 03though supposedly they did advertise them like 3 years ago XD
<Chimera> and um Feather
<Chimera> [11:55:20] <%drfsupercenter> I have emulators of all the classic game systems on my phone
<Chimera> [11:55:51] <%Feather> I could do the same with my iPod lol
<Chimera> That's a sad lie, unless you jailbreak which I found acgtually also makes it WORSE.

<drfsupercenter> 03Asus is better than Dell at least
<drfsupercenter> 03and HP
<Airwolf> ASUS ROG is very good for people who want performance, even if it does lean slightly towards Alienware-type pricing
<drfsupercenter> 03my MSI is also :P
<Airwolf> though I do see an offer of that same laptop for <£1200 ... if only I had managed to get a summer job
<Airwolf> that thing's comparable with this desktop

<Aurora> 6I say yay for those ghost hybrids
*HyperMetalLugia 2Still has the SL theme in another tab... XD
<Ripred> 2fire/bug? xD
<Roleplay4life> 5And my friend Alex is completely stoked about Black and White.
<Roleplay4life> 5Fire/Bug sounds so strange.
<sally> :o
<var> Excuses! Loopy is just being mean D:
<Aurora> 6oooh heads up
<Ripred> 2its like lightning/water
<Spyrorocks> My friend got fired from tim hortans
<Ripred> 2o_O
<Aurora> 6There are no evolutions or pre-evolutions of existing Pokemon in this generation,
<sally> never heard of it
<Ripred> 2aww
<Roleplay4life> 5O:
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<LoopyDood> What for?
<Curly> it's Canadian
<Articuno> 12LOOOOOOOOL!!!!! http://www.lugia.us/poll/happy-new-year.htm
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I like crispy Pokemans!
<Spyrorocks> hes a big fat kid who got caught eating doughnuts
<sally> oh :3
<Ripred> 2prevolutions
<Spyrorocks> no joke.
<sally> XD
<Articuno> 12What was I thinking LMAO
<Ripred> 2MABEY
<Aurora> 6ANYWAYS
<Curly> it's our national coffee/doughnut shop ^^
<Roleplay4life> 5LET'S ALL TYPE IN CAPS.
<Aurora> 6articuno
<HyperMetalLugia> 2What's the 2011 NY poll going to be like...?
<Aurora> 6looks like the evolutions might be legit
<Aurora> 6Oomura: I said, “How about a sea otter for the Water-type?” But if a sea otter were to evolve, what would it become? That’s where I hit a wall. Eventually I said that if a sea otter was to evolve, it would transform into something completely different. [Note: The third rumored evolution of Mijumaru from a few days ago looks completely different than Mijumaru.
<LoopyDood> And that's why :)
<Ripred> 2YES LETS
<Aurora> 6from the interview with the pokemon designers
<Spyrorocks> yep
<sally> like dunkins? or starbucks?
<Ripred> 2I LIKE TALKING IN CAPS
<Spyrorocks> tim hortans is very canadian.
<Spyrorocks> Not like dunkin doughnuts
<LoopyDood> The weird thing is, doughnuts are free if you're on shift
<Curly> it's like starbucks
<Curly> kinda
<Articuno> 12That doesn't tell us anything O___o
<Roleplay4life> 5@Roara :: Well. That's kinda crazy.
<Spyrorocks> Its got higher quality food.
<Aurora> 6it does say enough
<Curly> Tim Hortons is more of a restaurant though
<Ripred> 2articuno
*HyperMetalLugia 2breaks everybody's caps!
<LoopyDood> It's a cross between a coffee shop and a deli
<Feather> 10I love this one XD
<Feather> 10http://www.lugia.us/poll/do-you-laugh-out-loud-in-real-life-when-you-say-lol.htm
<Spyrorocks> its fast food but high quality.
<Aurora> 6because if mijumaru's evolution is supposed to be far different....look at that the rumor is
<LoopyDood> Yeah
<Articuno> 12LOL!
<Ripred> 2you should make it so you dont have to dowload anything to listen to ICEcast =P
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I never!
<Articuno> 12It's not that different
<Feather> 10I probably voted never XD
<sally> i've only seen a deli inside of walmart
<Roleplay4life> 5I would think that the Mijumaru evo would at least like mammalian..
<LoopyDood> Subway's has better sandwiches
<Spyrorocks> walmart dely...
<Spyrorocks> deli*
<Aurora> 6articuno, how O_O
<Spyrorocks> Subway puts me on the toilet for at least 30 minutes.
<Aurora> 6it's WAY different
<LoopyDood> Haha
<LoopyDood> What do you get?
<sally> eeewww
<sally> lol tmi
<Curly> mmmm subway
<Spyrorocks> lots of chiplote sauce
<Ripred> 2haha: no laugh, lol: smile, LOL: giggle, ROFL: laugh
<LoopyDood> Well
<LoopyDood> That's why
<Airwolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGcE7IudRKE
<Spyrorocks> but without it the subs suck

<Spyrorocks> sometimes its worth it :P
<LoopyDood> Dude
<Aurora> 6o-o
<sally> ooo
<LoopyDood> Sweet onion sauce
<sally> i love chipotle!
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Jeepers....
<Spyrorocks> me too.
<sally> :3 does canada have chipotle?
<Spyrorocks> Yes
<LoopyDood> Honey mustard too
<Articuno> 12It's just another blue otter
<Ripred> 2LADIN VS USA
<Spyrorocks> Im canadian.
<Ripred> 2I WANT THAT
<Articuno> 12But bigger..
<sally> best resturant evah
<Spyrorocks> You know what I miss
<LoopyDood> Either one makes subs not suck
<sally> noo not like that
<Aurora> 6how do you see an otter in that?
<Roleplay4life> 5Wut the wut. o-o
<Articuno> 12Kinda like Marshtomp and the last one
<Spyrorocks> the hot mustard sauces from mcdonalds
<Curly> oh, I just noticed, there are more Canadians talking here than any other country at the moment :O
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't see the otter either.
<sally> i mean Chipotle as in the resturant
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Polar Bears VS. GlobalWarming!
<LoopyDood> Haha
<Spyrorocks> they discontinued them
<Spyrorocks> Oh
<Spyrorocks> sally, No
<Spyrorocks> I dont think so
<LoopyDood> sally is surrounded by Canadians
<sally> what about panda express?
<Roleplay4life> 5But at least Marshtomp had some really obvious connections to Mudkip. o-o
<Spyrorocks> I think we have that
<sally> :o nuh uh
<Articuno> 12All the Pokemon change and look bigger/stronger but keep teh same features
<sally> yaaay
<Aurora> 6it looks like some dragon canine hybrid thing
<Articuno> 12Blaziken is a great example
<Articuno> 12It looks nothing like a chick/chicken anymore
<Articuno> 12But it's awesome
<Spyrorocks> its chinese food right
<Aurora> 6mijumaru's evolution chain is so way out of whack
<Roleplay4life> 5If I looked at Mijumaru's final evo and then Mijumaru, I probably wouldn't see the evolutionary connection.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Or does it...
<Articuno> 12No way, has a mustelid face
<sally> yes :D
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6http://pokebeach.com/news/0910/rumored-mijumaru-evos.jpg
<Espeon> ew
<Feather> 10bbl
<sally> uh ohz
<sally> i gotta go
<HyperMetalLugia> 2IS that you Suicune??
<Articuno> 12That face looks like that of an otter/weasel a lot more than it's pre-evos..
<Spyrorocks> Im getting into the forums this year for my onlineschool
<HyperMetalLugia> 2SuiKip
<Spyrorocks> the last two years i never paid them any attention.
<Ripred> 2!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Ripred for 12 minutes
<Roleplay4life> 5Okay, maybe a LITTLE bit in the legs... And in the face.. But the snout is kinda long compared to the pre-evolutions.
<Ripred> 2brb
<Aurora> 6ok face aside, I still don't see it
<Articuno> 12You mean like how an otter should be?
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Aurora> 6but aside from the face
<Aurora> 6how does it related to mijumaru
<Aurora> 6-d
<Articuno> 12The face and the pose is aquatic..
<Articuno> 12Like an otter
*HyperMetalLugia 2thinks it looks like a Seal
<Spyrorocks> so far its been interesting, its all 14-19 year olds
<Aurora> 6aquatic is a broad term lol
<Articuno> 12How does Blaziken relate to Torchic or Combusken though?
<Aurora> 6theres what....40 water type pokemon?
<Roleplay4life> 5But it's also a quadruped instead of bipedal.
<Aurora> 6they're a lot more related than this thing
<Aurora> 6it's clear they're birds
<Articuno> 12Aquatic as in built for the sea.. as in.. NOT a dog..
<HyperMetalLugia> 2NOOOOO.....
<Aurora> 6lol I still see dog
*HyperMetalLugia 2want's more fire types
<Aurora> 6heavy-build, longer snout
<Articuno> 12Yeh well it's clear that the evo is a mammal.. a bird is a broad term too, is it clear that Blaziken is a chicken?
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I still see a SealTomb
<Aurora> 6but anyways
<Aurora> 6that thing look NOTHING like an otter
<Aurora> 6noooothing
<Articuno> 12Face
<Aurora> 6although-
<Aurora> 6NOT EVEN LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> 2nah...
<Articuno> 12It has a perfect otter face under all the whiskery thingies
<Aurora> 6I can't use the "species" relation though...that got blown away after remoraid
<Aurora> 6omg wait
<Articuno> 12http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/images/2007/08/29/otter1a_470x350.jpg
<Aurora> 6those are whiskers?
<Articuno> 12I dunno what they are XD
<Aurora> 6it looks like they're coming off the neck LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Yes they are XD
<Roleplay4life> 5And Blaziken does have the same claws and colour scheme as Torchic.. But I agree that one's not THAT close to Torchic.
<Aurora> 6mijumaru's line's color palette is so out of whack
<Aurora> 6goes from pastel blue/white to tealish and dark blue to blue and gray
<Articuno> 12I like that
<Articuno> 12It gets better
<Aurora> 6and the shells keep changing color
<HyperMetalLugia> 2It's change....
<Aurora> 6I would like to see some consistency
<Aurora> 6EITHER WAY
<Aurora> 6these things better prove to be false
<Aurora> 6I hate all of the
<Aurora> 6m
<Roleplay4life> 5But the first and second-generation starters it was REALLY obvious what the lines were.
<Articuno> 12I particularly like the snake but after this discussion I am REALLY starting to like the ottery thing
<Aurora> 6even third and 4th gen were obvious
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Easy Cyndaquil-Typhloshion
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6well
<Lugianite> hi all
<Roleplay4life> 5REALLY.
<Aurora> 6yeah, these are all crap
<Roleplay4life> 5Hi Lugianite. ^^
<Articuno> 12lies
<Aurora> 6I like the starters 1st stages though
<Umbreon> 12hi Lugianite
<Lugianite> how is everyone?
<Aurora> 6seriously look at that thing though
<Articuno> 12I hate the first stages
<Aurora> 6what happened to mijumaru's tail
<Aurora> 6in the third stage, it's a fan
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Fine, but complain about the Starters in the 5th gen
<Articuno> 12It got awesome
<Aurora> 6before, it was a beaver
<Aurora> 6that's ridiculously different
<Aurora> 6like
<Aurora> 6there's no consistency
<Aurora> 6at all
<Aurora> 6oh god
<Aurora> 6I think this might actually be legit
<HyperMetalLugia> 2What's even more bad?
<Articuno> 12It was always called an otter ovO
<Roleplay4life> 5What, the leaked images?
<Airwolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269uRYEUBd8 egads

<HyperMetalLugia> 2How do you know?
<Aurora> 6I see a connection between the leaked images and the description in the interview
<Airwolf> THAT is why people go for undubbed
<Articuno> 12If Smugleaf or whatever can be called a SNAKE.. then I think it's safe to say Mijumaru's an otter!
<Aurora> 6mijumaru's supposed to take on japanese culture, all three starters are regional
*Articuno watches
<Lugianite> lol
<Aurora> 6mijumaru was supposed to be samurai like
<Lugianite> Mijarus a clown >>
<Aurora> 6I never said mijumaru wasn't an otter o_o
<Articuno> 12Yeh it's a clown
<Aurora> 6I said its evo isn't
<Ripred> 2back
<Articuno> 12Airwolf lol...
<Aurora> 6its part narwhal
<Lugianite> eeets a clown :P
*Quilava meh.
<Articuno> 12The voices just DONT fit the characters for a start....
<Roleplay4life> 5 I don't think of Tsutaaja as much of a snake. More like a lizard with a really long nose. >__>
<Aurora> 6I can't see tsutaaja as a snake LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Really LOOONG?
<Articuno> 12The voice acting itself, no comment
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Airwolf> Arti, did you get to the kid yet?
<Articuno> 12yep...
<Aurora> 6tbh, it reminds me of a green anole
<Articuno> 12It sounds like someone got on a mic
<Lugianite> lol
*HyperMetalLugia 2wonders what kid...
<Articuno> 12LOOOL.. it sounds like a vent convo.......
<Aeroslash> hey, Aurora, I just watching your vid that's on TST, nicely done ^^
<Articuno> 12Sure this isn't a mic over?!
<Lugianite> now where duke nukem
<Aurora> 6what vid?

<DarkRockShooter> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Chaos Wars - Tonaty Voice Acting | Views: 4,806 | 20 likes, 3 dislikes
<Ripred> 2this is deffinatly a mic over
<Airwolf> that's the official western release
<Roleplay4life> 5An anole is kinda like a lizard... |D
<Aeroslash> A fast paced and awesome video featuring all the legendaries including Arceus! Made by Aurora! - 41.7MB
<Aeroslash> yeah, the legends one
<Airwolf> how they decided it was a good idea, I don't know
<Aurora> 6RP that;s my point
<Articuno> 12i'm shocked, that is perhaps the worst voice acting I've ever heard ovO
<Aurora> 6I don't see it as a snake
<Articuno> 12I thought FFXIII was bad...
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah.
<Ripred> 2this makes me want to cut myself....
<Articuno> 12LOL!!
<Aurora> 6looking at this image here, with mijumaru's two evos
<Aeroslash> O.o
<Aurora> 6it's pretty good to see how much they clash
<Ripred> 2=/
<Aurora> 6because the 2nd stage is already legit
<Airwolf> really, how did that get through the production process
<HyperMetalLugia> 2I thought 4kids had bad acting...
<Ripred> 2k well im going to go
<Aurora> 6maybe not that color
<Aurora> 6but
<Ripred> 2peace out yall
<Articuno> 12I should have gone already XD

<Stitch> Who here uses XHTML Strict? :o
<Umbreon> 07lol
<LaptopAristeo> o/
<Skylands> 10why did I misread ctcp for sharecropping
<Stitch> Would a </br> tag validate properly? My 4th period is web design and she's teaching XHTML, and used that instead of <br /> which is what I thought was proper.
<LaptopAristeo> <br></br> is correct and will probably validate but non-standard
<LaptopAristeo> <br /> is the standard
*Stitch nodnods.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Ughhh... can we continue our conversation about things?

<HyperMetalLugia> 2Feather has a Mac?
<Feather> 10no
<HyperMetalLugia> 2PHEW
<Peter> Oh you've never idled on IRC before? :P
<Feather> 10I have a Dell laptop :P
<Peter> Because I can think of several occasions.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Yay Laptops
<favulare> a lot of these fags sign on IRC for the sake of idling
<drfsupercenter> 03EW DELL
<favulare> a lot of them don't even have an aim and subconsciously click a button with the label
*HyperMetalLugia 2has a nice core i3 lenovo T410i Laptop, with 2 gigs of ram
<favulare> it's as if it's embedded into their daily routines
<Feather> 10EW DRF
*Feather runs
<favulare> to the point that it involved into a culture all its own where they think idling makes them look kickass.
<Espeon> I don't mind you being here, but seriously.
*HyperMetalLugia 2has a DELL Vostro 430 PC....
*HyperMetalLugia 2flys
<Feather> 10Dell Studio 15 here
<Espeon> I dunno if this is your kind of "funny" or whatnot but wow.
<favulare> put up or ban me
<drfsupercenter> 03no but seriously Dell is such crap now
<drfsupercenter> 03MSI 15.4" custom build here
<drfsupercenter> 03though I'm on my desktop atm, also a custom build
<Espeon> Lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2My vostro 430 is pretty good
<favulare> it's not humor.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Gameboo advanced
<favulare> humor is not a synonym for ripping on you 'tards.
<Quilava> just ban him :|
<Espeon> 0/10 try again
<favulare> i'm not trolling you either.
<favulare> i don't need a reaction
<Quilava> (he is trolling)
*HyperMetalLugia 2wondered where his fish went...
<Espeon> I'm not sure, if he does then he's doing a really bad job.
<favulare> just the fact that i make a <censored> who thinks he's tough <censored> eat his own is enough
<favulare> i'm not sure about that.
<favulare> you seem very inclined to ban me
<favulare> if you want to cop out with troll, then that's fine
<favulare> doesn't redeem you
<Espeon> Since it seems like you came here just to get banned, why not just leave~
<favulare> i'm here because i can be.
<Quilava> he came around to look like an ass :|
<Peter> So for real does anyone here play the ukulele?
<Skylands> 10No, Peter
<favulare> yes, peter
<Espeon> No @ Peter o3o
<Gameboo> Everyone does, obviously
<Peter> Oh okay
<Peter> That's cool
<Peter> Just wondered, it's pretty cool.
<favulare> quilava, that's
<favulare> that's quite ironic.
<favulare> :)
<Quilava> nou
<favulare> typical *chantard rebuttal
<Peter> nouveau, nouvel, nouvelle, nouveaux, nouvelles.
<Quilava> I don't care enough to come up with a comeback.
<favulare> you're trying awfully hard to convince me
<EpicStatsGuy> Char!!

<drfsupercenter> 03or

<Quilava> well I suppose there goes his reputation
<Temeraki> pfft
<Gameboo> ^
<Espeon> what reputation?
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it working?
<Quilava> not being a troll
<Feather> 10no :/
<Espeon> Nah, he doesn't seem to be like that usually but then again I don't know him xD
<HyperMetalLugia> You must have bad internet... or a horrible router
<Skylands> 10He just trolls whenever he "feels like it"
<Quilava> lol
<Gameboo> He's an awesome guy but none of you guys will ever know that sooooo
*Skylands knows him as good as Gameboo does
<Skylands> 10Sooooo
<Feather> 10We bought a new router just weeks ago
<Feather> 10must be internet
<Quilava> I'm confused <.>
<Espeon> Okay o3o

<Quilava> actually first..... what's LI?
<Skylands> 10Lugia's Island
<Quilava> whats that?
*HyperMetalLugia 2wonders what the response to his laptop's wallpaper will be....
<Skylands> 10a website
<Airwolf> did it start before the new router?
<Airwolf> did it start before the new router?
<Feather> 10yes
<Airwolf> then it's your connection
<Gameboo> Well, a website for another few moments anyway
<Airwolf> unless you really don't know how to choose routers
<HyperMetalLugia> 2Are there any loose cables?
<Quilava> eh?
<Skylands> 10We're closing it
<Quilava> how? :|
<Quilava> its your website?
<Skylands> 10no
<Quilava> rm?
<Airwolf> I think she's probably aware of things like loose cables
<Skylands> 10it was a community organized website
<Gameboo> Technically "ours", but at the same time, not really
<Skylands> 10after the original owner left
<Kyro|SanAndreas> O.o

<Airwolve> 2,130 new fonts installed
<Hawkie> 07Obsiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Airwolve> and Obsi if you mean by posting a Yt link with an unclean name, it filters
<Airwolve> so even if it did trigger it wouldn't have reason to
<Airwolve> or rather if it WOULD trigger
<Airwolve> that is a hard sentence to word
*Obsi should file a bug with the ircd developers then :P
<Obsi> Unless Arti specifically set up statsbot to be immune to kicking LOL
<Airwolve> Statsbot is the one that kicks
<Obsi> I know.
<Airwolve> so, as long as it's an on *:TEXT: trigger, it won't kick itself
<Obsi> Hey Ray, what're the first four letters on the middle row of your keyboard?
<Airwolve> as own text does not trigger a TEXT event
<drfsupercenter> 03Obsi, LOL, I don;'t think she kicks on asdf anymore
<Obsi> LOL no.
<Obsi> I was trying to see if I could get someone to say "No I ain't doing that!" or similar.

<Obsi> I can be a douche like that at times, as you should be aware by now :)
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well I wanna go shower, and I'm gonna install my warez Adobe CS5 collection while doing so.

<drfsupercenter> 03I mainly want it for lulz factor

<Skylands> 10[17:33] <@Espeon> I need to express my disapproval. <- By commenting on my journal? :3
<Aurora> 6YES
<Skylands> 10oh

<Aurora> 6but DIVE
<Aurora> 6IT'S BACK
<Aurora> 6<3
<Curly> well, on a motorcycle that would either be uncomfortable and stupid :X
<Espeon> xD
<Curly> woops
<Curly> delete that either
<Espeon> I will comment as well DON'T FEAR
*Curly crosses it out
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Curly> you'd get cold D:
<Curly> and wet maybe
<Curly> and then you crash and lose an arm D:
<Andres> Arms are overrated :o
<Aurora> 6ok seriously
<Chimera> Slash hay
<Aurora> 6a GARBAGE BAG?
<Aurora> 6WTF kind of design is that
<Andres> I want to replace my arms with bear arms :o
*Skylands commented on yours too
<Aurora> 6half these pokemon aren't even based off animals of any kind
<Aeroslash> hey Chimyy
<Andres> I should have the right to bear arms!
<Curly> hmmm... well Demo only has one eye and no arm and peg legs and she seems to be doing okay. maybe you're right o:
<Curly> arms*
<Chimera> wait
<Chimera> what
<Chimera> hold on
<Chimera> Dive is back
<Chimera> ?
<Chimera> RSE remake, anyone?
*Chimera runs
<Aurora> 6RSE doesn't need a remake
<Aurora> 6I've already explained why there wont be one
<Curly> /obscure reference
<Andres> Demo?
<Espeon> xD
<Andres> k D:
<DarkTruth> Andres !!!
<Espeon> Money can move mountains. And erase common sense.
<Aeroslash> umm it does, actually, Aurora
<Aeroslash> it deserves to be in 3-D
<DarkTruth> Curly I ride in a very small t Shirt usually :X
<Aeroslash> Kanto got it in SS and HG, so why not legendary Hoenn?
<DarkTruth> as long as its warm enough
<Aurora> 6absolutely not
<Aeroslash> O.o
<Aurora> 6Hoenn is compatible with the later-gen game stations
<Curly> I still don't think it's a good idea, but oh well
<Aurora> 6RBY and GSC were unable to transfer to RSE and beyond
<Aurora> 6which is why they made remakes
<Aeroslash> I get that
<Curly> motorcycle equipment is expensive as hell though >.>
<Curly> $650 for a jacket, gloves and a helmet
<Aurora> 6if they do remake hoenn, I doubt they will, I wont buy it
<Andres> If I had a motorcycle, I'd want to ride in platemail >:3
<Skylands> 10[17:43] <Gameboo> Oh come on, everyone says the exact same thing about every new generation. It just takes time to appreciate them <- Go die
<Aeroslash> I will
<Aeroslash> Hoenn's my favorite
<Espeon> that makes sense, but I still think they mostly want $$$
<Chimera> yeah
<Chimera> Hoenn sems cool
<Curly> I wasn't buying anything for myself though
<Chimera> *seems cool
<Curly> I'm probably going to end up buying everything off of Craigslist >.>
<Chimera> Also Roara
<Espeon> once they tried to redo the Lucario thing with Zoroark I actually got negative towards it.
<Aurora> 6hoenn is my favorite region, RSE my favorite games
<Aurora> 6I still will not buy a remake
<Aeroslash> brb rebooting
<Aurora> 6because the original design is what I fell in love with
<Chimera> I think they released the remakes on their 10th anniversaries for a reason
<Skylands> 10Lyon's comment on my journal: They look too damn similar to their prevolutions to really warrant an evolution
<Chimera> and yeah that design was <3
<Skylands> 10qft
<Chimera> I also liked the music
<Aurora> 6that might have something to do with it
<Chimera> DPPt made me dissapoint
<Drake> 04rerally
<Drake> 04really*
<Aurora> 6but again, if they didn't make a way to legitimately obtain all the earlier pokemon, that removes the original "gotta catch em all"
<Chimera> however the Vs Dialga/Palkia wasn't too bad
<Chimera> Platinum's Giratina battle was EPIC
*FlameLugia eats roxas
<Chimera> yeah true
<Touridor> very true
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Drake> 04what does qft mean?
<Touridor> ...wait what're we talkin about?
<Aurora> 6some of my favorite pokemon are in BW
<Aurora> 6which is why I'm still interested
<Aurora> 6otherwise
<Espeon> quoted for truth
<Drake> 04h
<Drake> 04ah*
<Chimera> heh
<Aurora> 6I would have made the decision here and now to not get them
<Satoshi> Sup everyone
<Drake> 04what is wrong with my spelling today?
<Chimera> lol satoshi
<Chimera> gtfo Animé :<
<Touridor> ...sounds like a type of sponge
*Chimera runs
<Touridor> i dunno
<Touridor> the name satoshi reminds me of a sponge
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Satoshi> Articuno still on ?
<Chimera> slasheh
<Aeroslash> lol hi
<Satoshi> Damn and here I thought I finally got on in time
<Drake> 04I have to say they did pretty well with the bird/flying Pokemon in this generation, like Espeon said
<Drake> 04but most of these are just freaking shit
<Espeon> yes
<Andres> To play or to sleep? D:
<Espeon> I mean it provoked ragefloof, it must be bad.
<Espeon> |3
<Chimera> heh

<Satoshi> How's your day going drf
<Drake> 04Aekeosu is either an Archeopteryx or a vulture
<Drake> 04lol
<Chimera> I think somebody, just SOMEBODY, should try making their own pokemon based game wit htheir own original creatures
<Chimera> like
<Chimera> ones that don't look like their concepts were brought by 12-year-olds
<Espeon> Enjoy your financial banhammer.
<Satoshi> Indeed
<Chimera> which sadly is what I think is the general public the Pokemon company is going towards
<Chimera> and lolz
<Espeon> Nintendo actually used to take down sites "defaming" Pokemans. At least a few. Then they gave up.
<Chimera> fangames
<Chimera> they can be awesome
<Lu> play
<Chimera> and also wat
<Lu> make something to eat too
<LeeroyJenkins|brb> ...couldnt.
<Andres> Thank you for your guideance
<Espeon> I thought oh Archeopteryx the moment I saw it! It's not that bad in fact.
<LeeroyJenkins|brb> resist.

<Skylands> 10Honchkrow is one of my favourite bird Pokemon
<Espeon> wbbbb
<Drake> 04it suits his 'ganster' style but I dislike it
<Skylands> 10and well, he's more feathery and fluffy than fat
<Skylands> 10he is a gentlemen.
