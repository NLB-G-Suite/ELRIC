<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry I won't be joining you.

<SolarColt> hey saxyinformer could you please fill me in on how to refrence someones name so they get a ding noise? :D
<MirrorImage> TheDr... wat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You know my opinion of EA.
<otakon> SolarColt: just type their nick
<Ingwaz> interesting, i was not aware, will it be an actual on disc game or xbla?
<TheDr> thats what i said
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yh, but BIOWARE made this, at least TRY THE DEMO!
<SolarColt> oh man thanks otakon i feel smart ._.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But EA published it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sure, SolarColt, you just type in their name. If you start to type their name, and press tab, it'll autocomplete
<Colt_of_Personality> hmm...what to do...
<TheDr> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KpES1G_5jg&feature=related
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And EA is very anti-consumer.
<otakon> SolarColt: no worries, I still don't know everything on to do with IRC myself
<Midnight_Tempest> Nittany_Discord: i dont like EA either, but they dont actually make the games... Bioware does, EA just gets money for it cause they bought them...
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: agreed on that one tbh
<MahBoi777> Colt_of_Personality: party? lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA ruins the games.
<SolarColt> oh thankyou as well SaxyPretender! seems to be working
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think, XBLA, Ingwaz
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: he doesn't want to support a publisher like EA
<Colt_of_Personality> Maybe...
<DwarvenLawnchair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4SmKXh78cI Alright. Last bit of sad music for now.
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: I dont either but if you dont buy the game then your not supporting Bioware or any other actual developers of the games...
<tgl1992> Is a stream back up or is it still down?
<otakon> eeyup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you buy EA-published games, you're keeping a business that only cares about investors alive. They'd rather screw you over.
<otakon> still down
<tgl1992> k
<KetaminaDianePie> :'(((((((((((
<KetaminaDianePie> y
<Colt_of_Personality> y there no stream yet?
<MahBoi777> Dead Island and UP sad music combined
<KetaminaDianePie> Y?!?!?!?!?
<Colt_of_Personality> what UP?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, sorry for Bioware.
<otakon> MahBoi777: are you TRYING to kill everyone here?
<mmendo24> im new here and i wanted to know when they play MLP episodes?:)
<SolarColt> KetaminaDianePie: you seem sad, just a guess though
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, there's going to be a revamped version of GGAC+ over in japanese arcades, that make Justice and Kliff not broken/banned
<Midnight_Tempest> Nittany_Discord: I know that, but if EA goes down then every company they bought goes with them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh well.
<DwarvenLawnchair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTAxtapb5JI&feature=related Ha ha, time for tears!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, I don't give a damn.

<otakon> MahBoi777: you'll be sucked into the sadness horizon!
<Midnight_Tempest> Justice and Kliff... broken... noooooo.... *sacrasm meter explodes*
<otakon> Kliff?
<MahBoi777> otakon: I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK!
<otakon> is that the guy with the HUGE sword?

<Colt_of_Personality> http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltm37pifv1qha245o1_400.png

<otakon> SaxyPretender: he kicks ass
<otakon> OOH!
<KetaminaDianePie> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know developers are more in-touch with gamers than publishers are, but publishers are ruining the industry and made me hate mainstream gaming, so I won't support them.
<otakon> SaxyPretender: I want to show you something?
<otakon> Imean I do, hold on
<SaxyPretender> 0,14shoot, otakon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If Bioware wants my money, I'll pay them directly for a copy.

<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> Define "Lame" and reading a fanfic doesn't make you a sissy, unlike you I'm not an emotionless human being that doesn't mind reading something that could move someone's heart, Also that's unfair to people whom﻿ are "Gay", calling someone gay makes you feel tough doesn't it? better yet, it could be your own thoughts about your sexuality... beats me, I know I'm a heterosexual 19 year old male who happens to like ponies... Dealwithit.avi

<Midnight_Tempest> it wasnt hard to unlock him...
<LadyCanary> I've never played much Guilty Gear, but I love the fact that heavy metal/hard rock music is involved with the characters and some moves ^_^
<Placebo> I'm confused as to why anyone would WANT to go to 4chan.
<steamdrive> Dead or alive is best fighter game
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: did you not hear me? I SUCK AT FIGHTING GAMES
<Polydunami> Messing with trolls, i guess

<Placebo> otakon: That's somewhat the case in some game types, but it boils down to DMR/BR battles for the most part.
<Tarku> so I was at the store, talking to a friend about poniez and some guy said poniez suck, and i was like " http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1008/ "
<steamdrive> she eats hooves(in a sense of thought)

<SolarColt> Polydunami: I love them all but out of the six i'd say fluttershy is my favorite :D
<steamdrive> Rainbow dash and twi are my fav
<SolarColt> what about least favorite?
<Placebo> Rarity's character really hasn't impressed me.
<Spawn0701> Dash and AJ favs for me
<Polydunami> SolarColt: Actually, it's more of a tie between Rarity and Fluttershy for me
<steamdrive> I like how apple and dashy are voiced by same person
<Polydunami> And Pinkie Pie
<Placebo> steamdrive: FS and PP are as well.
<Spawn0701> indeed

<Polydunami> I guess if I was prodded hard enough, I'd choose Rainbow Dash
<Placebo> Big mac is best pony.
<SolarColt> haha whys that?
<Polydunami> But that's really pushing it
<Polydunami> I don't hate her at all
<Tovler> I love doctors. They never lie to you.
<SolarColt> well, lets put it this way
<Spawn0701> Luna, Derpy, Rarity, Nightmare moon, Zecora, Granny Smity
<MahBoi777> WHOA
<SolarColt> which pony out of equestria do you dislike the most
<MahBoi777> Rarity

<Placebo> Prince Blueblood's a dick.
<the> ditto
<SolarColt> yeah agreed
<Placebo> Thought one fanfic makes him in like, my top 10..
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: would you rather have it be something that cripples you and COULD have been prevented? Don't you think seeing her son permanently damaged would be WORSE at this point bc your doing it to 'protect' her? SHES YOUR MOTHER, she cares about your wellbeing and you are here and kicking.
<Placebo> though*
<SolarColt> but trixie is also a bit of a bitch
<Placebo> OMG, wallz, otakon
<Polydunami> Placebo: same here

<Simon> SuperBrony64: you probably ruined the server by putting shit loads of TNT and trigger it
<lakingsfans> it's one oclock and i'm getting tired but this is to damn awesome
<Simon> and now
<Chaospony_837> @Polydunami, that sounds really awesome! I also dream about voice acting with John de Lancie as Discord's apprentice.
<SolarColt> your at the edge of the world....?
<Simon> thanks to you, I can't login to the server anymore
<TOY_PON32> I want to be a famous Brony..it just takes time. And patience...and skill.
<Hodiku> lol Simon, me either
<Polydunami> Lol
<MahBoi777> that can't be Simon, TNT solves all problems
<Chaospony_837> @SolarColt, your's is...chaotically awesome! Be my chaos partner?

<Simon> SuperBrony64: I think you're too playful
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm trying to find it O___O
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: don't worry, be happy
<Polydunami> Just thought, "Hey, why not walk down the street to Oceans Studios and request a part?"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What's wrong with being playful? ;A;
<Simon> THIS
<Hodiku> :D
<Simon> you put shit loads of tnt and triggered it
<lakingsfans> everything maybe causes people harm
<TOY_PON32> I can't..I need to fulfill my dream.
<Simon> and now, server ruined
<MahBoi777> TNT ALL THE THINGS
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We put WAAAAAAAAAY more TNT before on that mountain and it survived
<Chaospony_837> Anypony heard about Project Saturation? I'm considering to voice act for the part of Fluttershy. Or mayb even a minor part if they get one.
<Polydunami> I think, out of everyone here, I live closest to Ocean Studios
<lakingsfans> besides tnt always solves your problems on single player worlds that is
<SuperBrony64> 10,02See, it's fine
<Hodiku> hooray, im in
<SolarColt> whats saturation if you dont mind explaining?
<Polydunami> Or at least second or third closest
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You need to relax Simon ^_^
<MahBoi777> Chaospony_837: YES, I can't wait till they finish it!
<Polydunami> It's not really bragging for me
<Simon> SuperBrony64: not that I'm not relaxed, it's just that I think you're too playful
*TOY_PON32 looks at his homework and gives an emotionless look
<lakingsfans> uh oh the vikings were right the world is flat
<Simon> And atm
<Simon> I still can't get into the server
<PartyCannon> Server's not ruined, just having problems holding a connection
<MahBoi777> SolarColt: it's a fanmade animation project, hang on, I got a link
<unfoundbug> which server are you on?
<TOY_PON32> Chemistry isnt going to help me become well known..
<Simon> PartyCannon: not really
<Hodiku> hooray for tnt!
<Chaospony_837> Satuartion is when you make things more colorful. You know how Discord made the Mane Six all grey and took away their elements? Well in the story he actually takes them to an extreme so that they're their elements in a bad way.
<Hodiku> :[
<Simon> I never have this problem on that server
<lakingsfans> :[
<Simon> even with high ping
<SolarColt> sounds interesting i'll have to look into it
<Chaospony_837> Oh, and I don't mind you asking at all SolarColt.
<Simon> SuperBrony64: since you've been putting too much TNT, I blame you
<Polydunami> ^
<SolarColt> well thankyou you're very kind Chaospony_837
<Polydunami> ^__^
*TOY_PON32 is deciding to fulfill dream or give up

<SolarColt> thanks :)
<MahBoi777> no prob
<lakingsfans> do some more videos while you wait then
<Simon> SuperBrony64: nope
<TOY_PON32> Polydunami: It's not that simple I want to make what you call an 'impact'
<Chaospony_837> Aww...thanks Solar. Will you be on the server tomorrow waiting for the live feed? I'd like to chat with you again soon. you seem nice.
<Polydunami> Okay
<TOY_PON32> It's impossible for somepony like me..
<Polydunami> If you want to make an impact, go right ahead
<Kammerjunk> Have I ever told you guys just how much I don't like my school?
<Polydunami> TOY_PON32: you put yourself down way too hard
<RAINBOWCRASH> ping me when something happens
<MahBoi777> Chaospony_837: which role were you planning to try out for?
<Chaospony_837> @SolarColt, just in case you didn't catch my post, will you be on the server tomorrow waiting for the live feed? I'd like to chat with you again soon. you seem nice.
<TOY_PON32> Polydunami: That's how I feel bro. I'm pretty depressed as of right now.

<Kammerjunk> 4chan MLP board?
<Kammerjunk> What?
<Kammerjunk> moot, what are you doing?
<Chaospony_837> @MahBoi777, hopefully Fluttershy. But I'm not an expert in voicing her so I'm hoping that I can audition for a side role.
<Polydunami> Today's failure will lead to tomorrow's success
<Simon> lol streamception
<lakingsfans> so i herd you like streams
<TOY_PON32> I don't have any programs to draw, or make music, or even videos. I have nothing...not even confidence..
*TOY_PON32 drinks
<Hodiku> SB64, still no :-P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's weird, the server is still down O___O
<Polydunami> TOY_PON32: what do you like to do?
<Simon> ugh... Now I'm pissed off at SuperBrony64's TNT spam
<Kammerjunk> TOY_PON32: Well, get them!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sorry, didn't mean to crash the server :/
<Simon> SuperBrony64: too playful...
<Chaospony_837> @SolarColt, well thank you sir gentlecolt. I'm actually fairly new to Bronystate too. But I need to go to bed, so I'll catch you later!

<TOY_PON32> Kammerjunk: School is in my way I wanna graduate so I can have more time. Sure I'll have a job but I will have more time.
<Kammerjunk> I swear, I had SUCH a hard time watching the original Reacts video.
<Chaospony_837> Oh, and check out Discorded Ponies on YouTube if you get bored. It's awesome!
<Kammerjunk> TOY_PON32: School is such a party pooper.

<Polydunami> I, too, suffer from bouts of low confidence
<Kammerjunk> I just realised that I was talking as if you ponies could hear the "Teens React" video in the background.
*TOY_PON32 drinks more
<Kammerjunk> Subsequently, I realised that it was open in another of my 100-some tabs.
<MahBoi777> Chaospony_837: I'm afraid I won't be able to make it, hope yall have fun!:)
<Simon> I still can't reach the goddamn server

*TOY_PON32 is still angry
<lakingsfans> the servers trolling you
<PartyCannon> dat Minecraft lag
<Kammerjunk> The hay are you even making?
<TOY_PON32> If I can make atleast, ATLEAST a ask blog then I'm set. But I don't know how to draw well.
<Simon> SuperBrony64: if you like spamming TNTs, do that either in small scale or do it in SP
<Polydunami> There are things I'm angry about myself
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: if you make a tumblr, I will follow it, lol
<Polydunami> I'm still angry about that bloody rejection message I got on facebook :[
<lakingsfans> your getting trolled big time
<Kammerjunk> I'd be angry about some things about myself, too, but that's one of the problems.
<Kammerjunk> I'm not angry.
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: I made one already but it's gone to shit already
<Polydunami> I don't get angry most of the time
<Kammerjunk> Restart the server.
<Polydunami> But you don't want to see my angry face
<Polydunami> I am not kidding
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: oh you have?

<Kammerjunk> I want to see your cooooool faaace.
<lakingsfans> hot tub
<Simon> TIMEOUT
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: Yeah..I made promises I couldn't keep
<Kammerjunk> But I'm a bit of a wild card, I suppose. I could never be disloyal to my friends, but I also lie almost at random.
<MahBoi777> awww, that's okay, have you made an OC yet?
<TOY_PON32> I need to perfect my OC then once I've perfected it then I start.
<Hodiku> lol sb64, master of the obvious
<Kammerjunk> Something is seriously wrong with this server.
<Polydunami> TNT. That is what's wrong with this server
<Simon> I can't connect to the fucking server again
<Kammerjunk> I think you need to restart it.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What's wrong with TNT? I'm not using it right now
*TOY_PON32 drinks more
<RainbowJack> SB Blow up server agian?
<Simon> SuperBrony64: was
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: it coming along fine?
<Simon> RainbowJack: Apparently yes
<lakingsfans> it causes server brwakdowns
<Simon> ^
<TOY_PON32> I need to fix it.
<RainbowJack> that silly filly alwasy does that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can it be fixed?
<Kammerjunk> Too many blocks to remove and calculations to do for the server.
<MahBoi777> ah
<Simon> If Saturn is here, hopefully he'll try to restart the server
<Polydunami> SuperBrony64: time heals all wounds ^__^
<MahBoi777> lalalalalalalalala
<lakingsfans> just do something else while you wait for the server to get fixed
<Kammerjunk> Go to Saturn's house and throw a rock through the window with the text "GO ON BRONYSTATE".
<Polydunami> ^
<Polydunami> Do it
<MahBoi777> LOL
<MahBoi777> that'd be hilarious

<Sumica> 00,10you should see the size of the hole I made doing that
<Cypresswolf> If you dig down far enough in minecraft, can you reach the bottom? or does it go through to an underside?
<Polydunami> Minecraft is a flat world
<Kammerjunk> You reach bedrock, eventually.
<mooponi> oh man the internet http://i.imgur.com/8FGHb.png
<Cypresswolf> ...so...no empty space underworld? or is bedrock un digable
<Hodiku> bedrock is unbreakable
<Polydunami> Usually
<Hodiku> (unless admin)
<Polydunami> Underneath the bedrock, otherwise, is an empty black void
<MahBoi777> land squid!

<Phase4> ohai Mutterguy
<Cypresswolf> couple minutes
<Mutterguy> and Hi everyone
<RainbowJack> hi mutter
<Mutterguy> ok just worried about bandwidth because I forgot to close the bronystate tab
<Mutterguy> hi RainbowJack
<Phase4> Mutterguy: how long has that tab been open?
<Phase4> sb was streaming earlier
<Mutterguy> about 6 hrs :(
<Scootaloo> :(
<Phase4> Mutterguy: ah... well then
<Cypresswolf> Is it bad I put my new Scootaloo & Sweetie Belle custom next to manic Twilight? Im looking over at my pony shelf...and they seem....to all be staring at me
<Mutterguy> it's one thing having the tab open and watching it but if it's just playing
*Mutterguy wants to play on this server...
<Phase4> i think its single player
<Sumica> 00,10I will see if I can get a server running later on.
<Mutterguy> never got to try the technic mod because soon as I had the server read.. UPDATE
<Mutterguy> *ready
<Sumica> 00,10it's not full technic, just IC2 and BC
<Cypresswolf> Does minecraft require internet to play?
<Sumica> 00,10you can play off line but generaly you have to log in to the servers when you first launch
<RainbowJack> you have to buy minecraft?
<Phase4> yes RainbowJack
<RainbowJack> thats to bad
<Phase4> http://www.minecraft.com
<RainbowJack> i know
<Cypresswolf> Spore ruined net connected games for me. couldnt do anything without logging in first
<Phase4> um,,, aparently thats the wrong domain
<Phase4> http://www.minecraft.net is the right one
*RainbowJack sighs "i dont really like the game because it costs money for GFX like that"
<Phase4> RainbowJack: those gfx are not as simple to do as you think
<RainbowJack> i know but it looks a bit cheap in my eyes to even give money for
<RainbowJack> it looks nice to play but dont want to pay for that
<Sumica> 00,10so get a cosmedic pack and make it look nice.
<RainbowJack> i would really like to play it
<KwakLad> So much hate for fluttershy right now -_- and i feel bad saying that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You streaming Sumica/
<SuperBrony64> 10,02?
<RainbowJack> hate for fluttershy?
<Mutterguy> that's crazy! What did she do?
<Phase4> RainbowJack: you need to pay if you want multiplayer, if you just download it single player works fine
<Phase4> KwakLad: wut?
<Phase4> how
<KwakLad> I'm masking her in a clip as im attempting a music video, but i am new (taught myself on wednesday) and im having to mask frame by frame, took me all of yesterday (18 hours) to mask 4 seconds
<KwakLad> because she moves her head
<KwakLad> but what i have done up to now looks good so im perseveering
<Sumica> 00,10nope

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Rayman Origins
<Bronyzilla> -,-
<Sumica> 00,10oh
<Artemis> DRAKE
<KwakLad> It sold very well on release i think thats why it went sale quite early?
<Artemis> [18:40:12] <~Artemis> We should have Leo kidnapped and then tortured
<Artemis> [18:40:17] <~Artemis> and have Rhy and Nathan rescue him
<Artemis> [18:40:23] <~Artemis> but Indie doesn't want them to
<Artemis> [19:55:56] <~Artemis> also note to self: Nathan needs to save Rhy sometime while she's trapped
<Artemis> [19:56:19] <~Artemis> note number 2: Rhy needs to do a cliche back-to-opponent, who runs up, and then she kills him in 3 hits
<Tovler> Should I wait for the 3DS version to be released and wait again for its price to go down, or should I just get the wii version, which is already cheap.
<GLaDOS> if only i love me
<GLaDOS> woooo
<Bronyzilla> There's going to be a 3ds version? :D
<Bronyzilla> : D
<Phase4> this game looks excelently designed
<Tovler> I'll wait for the demo of the 3DS version and base my decision on that
<Bronyzilla> Yeah.

<Kammerjunk> The hard way.
<Tovler> Halloween is fun as hell.
<Kammerjunk> It's annoying.
<LordCelestia> 0,5But for some reason God decided it was funny to knock down 1/3 of the country's trees and knock out my internet for a god damn week when it wasnt even winter yet...
<Tovler> ooh, pun intended
<Kammerjunk> You get interrupted every 10 minutes because some kids knock at your door.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02hai :3
<Twitch> It also has hands...
<Bronyzilla> D:
<imabrony> how long is this gonna take?
<Tovler> being a measly 5' 9"… is ok.
<Bronyzilla> The doorway looks scary too...
<Twitch> What game is this?
<Twitch> Or whatever it is.
<FlutterDash> anyone from new zealand?
<Tovler> Rayman Origins
<Twitch> Ooh, haven't seen anything Rayman forever. It scared me when I was a kid.
<imabrony> lol
<imabrony> i loved rayman
<Bronyzilla> Can't say I really played it tbh.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I LOVE PONIEZ
<Twitch> I never got past the level where you ride on the back of a giant mosquito. Not sure which Rayman it was, though.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol
<imabrony> =0
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That was either 1 or this game
<Twitch> Probably one.
<Tovler> know of Rayman but have never played the games.
<A> hello?
<imabrony> yyyees
<Twitch> Definately wasn't this one.
<Bronyzilla> :D
<Twitch> Not creepy enough.
<imabrony> oh no
<Bronyzilla> Rofl.
<Nicool2cool> ohai
<Tovler> I've seen creepy boss pictures from this game
<imabrony> XD
<Bronyzilla> Heythere.
<Twitch> I just think it was the art style that scared me or whatever, considering I was like 8.
<imabrony> dead
<imabrony> nnn
<Bronyzilla> -,-
<Twitch> Who's playing?
<Bronyzilla> SB
<Tovler> It reminds me Earthworm Jim, a little bit
<Twitch> Is SB the main streamer?
<Bronyzilla> Not sure.
<Tovler> No, Sumica is
<Twitch> First time I've heard that name.
<Bronyzilla> Is it?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm streaming right now
<imabrony> uh
<Twitch> O.po
<Tovler> victory hump
<Twitch> Parasprites
<imabrony> ded
<Tovler> easier or harder than DKCR?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I don't know...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02This game is definitely more fast paced
<Bronyzilla> I can see that. o,o
<Bronyzilla> :3
<Tovler> The controls look floaty, if that makes sense
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup
<Tovler> ah, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. That's what I'm being reminded of.
<FlutterDash> hiii
<KwakLad> Hullo FlutterDash
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Darn....4 short
<FlutterDash> why isnt anyone talkgin
<Bronyzilla> Not sure.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02yup, it's a nymph
<Tovler> o joy. more LALALALALALALA
<KwakLad> Those things are cool when singing
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<Tovler> What happens when the Eletoons turns pink?
<Twitch> That tune will be seared into my brain while I sleep.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Electoons are pink when they are happy I think :>
<Bronyzilla> :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But it's cool, cause their name is similar to that of Electrons, which also are important to everything in our world ^_^
<Tovler> the world would be more positive without electrons
<Twitch> Wow.
<Phase4> Tovler: o u
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<Twitch> I must be tired, cos that made me laugh.
<Bronyzilla> This looks fun. : )

<Phase4> well pdnsd is running. should anything happen to the dns servers in anons silly attempt i'm going to be gine

<Bronyzilla> =It's a nice song. :3
<Twitch> True, but I can feel it eroding my brain.
<Tovler> it needs more bom bom boms
<Bronyzilla> COuld get creepy after a while.
<Twitch> So, are the parasprite things called Electoons? Or was that something else?
<Tovler> Ole
<Bronyzilla> Are they oranges or blades?
<Tovler> Autoscroll? more like autotroll
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Orange blades

*Tovler is intercepted
<Bronyzilla|HW> Okay...
<Bronyzilla|HW> Has the chat died?
<MakerDusk> yup
<Phase4> and i'm back. damned real life
<Jim> ohai everypony
<Phase4> hai Jim
<Phase4> so its me and Jim
<Jim> There's nobody else here?
<unfoundbug> would be more active but working atm
<Phase4> well theres 68 here but none responding no
<Jim> Hmm, well, that's expected at this hour
<Phase4> ohai unfoundbug
<Phase4> thats fair
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/VC9Ya well i'm preped, how bout you?
<KwakLad> i got plenty of ponies for 31st march if it happens
<Tovler|MagicalGirl> Like when Anonymous shut down facebook last november?
<Jim> oh well, better stock up on ponies before that
<unfoundbug> so, time to ping the servers you like and write donw the ip address
<unfoundbug> internet still works fine
<unfoundbug> this is alot less scary if you know how the internet works
<Tovler|MagicalGirl> The time travel episode +2 others will be out when the internet shuts down. I'll be ok with it gone.
<KwakLad> Its alot les scary if you aren't particularly meithered
<KwakLad> Afterall its only supposed to be temporary
<KwakLad> A protest, not a killing
<Tovler|MagicalGirl> The internet will be shut down Saturday. The financial markets will be so inconvenienced.
<KwakLad> Tovler|MagicalGirl: Damn good sarcastic point
<djackson> hey everypony
<KwakLad> hullo djackson
<Jim> ohai DJ-P0N-3
<Jim> failtab
<Jim> ohai djackson
<djackson> ohai
<djackson> jaim
<djackson> jim*
<paradise92> hello all :)
<paradise92> i see the stream is still off
<Jim> hi paradise92
<KwakLad> Well paradise92 its just gone off not long ago, and hi
<paradise92> ooh rly?
<paradise92> who was streaming?
<Phase4> ohai paradise92
<Phase4> and DJ-P0N-3
<KwakLad> SuperBrony64|Zzz was streaming paradise92
<paradise92> hi Phase4 :)
<paradise92> and tnx KwakLad :)
<KwakLad> That ping scared me -_-
<Phase4> what anon is atempting to do is take down the 'root nameservers'
<Phase4> which is the thing that allows, for example, 'www.google.com' to be turned into an ip address your browser can use
<Phase4> i doubt they will manage it, alot of work goes into making sure those things dont die
<Jim> I'll go make myself dinner now, be back later
<Phase4> later Jim
<Tovler|MagicalGirl> wasn't there a similar attack like that many years ago?
<skyguardian18> No stream?
<unfoundbug> the financial sector will go unhindered by the attack
<paradise92> for you Jim it is dinner
<paradise92> but for me it is Lunch!
<unfoundbug> those things will be IP locked rather than using something like DNS
<unfoundbug> damnit, the attacks on pony day
<Phase4> unfoundbug: static ip's will have no problems, but every website you use will be
<Phase4> that alone will cause a lot of problems
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server
<paradise92> somepony want to play Stronghold Crusader?
<Tovler|MagicalGirl> Smile Smile Smile vs Flim Flam Brother Song
<unfoundbug> Phase, i already started getting the IPs of every site i use
<unfoundbug> excel will serve as an adequate dns during this issue
<unfoundbug> i'm just unsure as to how the episode streams will behave
<Phase4> unfoundbug: pdnsd
<HeavyMetalDash> good morning/afternoon/evening(depending on your region) everypony!
<Phase4> morning HeavyMetalDash

<Sundaysmile> Johnny quest~?
<pony_7733> YES
<pony_7733> GOD I LOVED THAT SERIES
<CountDoofus|afk> saw a new dA alert, so checked that out first. really going now :p
<Rain> so is wrek wreking or is he gaming?
<Ictiv> I'm not completely sure Smile Smile Smile will ever be part of an episode. Much like Oink Oink Oink was moved around in the schedule until it found its place in Baby Cakes, it probably is a song they put away for an appropriate time. With the link, I'm not sure there will be such a time
<Ictiv> And I'm not sure why i wrote all that
<Rain> lol
<Pyrexo> Nostalgia Critic
<Ictiv> I gues I'm just lonely as none of the regulars are regulating the room of the regulars
<KwakLad> Knife + Rocket = Knocket?
<Pyrexo> Reguception.
<Rain> Ictiv how many people are there?
<Ictiv> 11
<Rain> I might get in there
<Ictiv> But none of them are actually in the room
*Rain shrugs
<RainBowJack> First you wiggel your tail OINK OINK! then wiggel your snout OINK OINK OINK! Wiggel your Rump OINK OINK OINK then SHOUT it out OINK OINK OINK
<Pyrexo> I've been here back when we communicated through star alignments.
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<Rain> better than chillin with people I dont know
<Ictiv> Also.. Why do I get the feeling that Kammerjunk is streaming while that is impossible?
<Pyrexo> Old skool.
<RainBowJack> i love pinkie Pig
<Pyrexo> Jk been here for like 2 weeks :$
<RainBowJack> pinkies one man show
<Ictiv> It Pinkie Fit
<Sundaysmile> would the mods mind if I posted a link to Wrex's soundtrack on youtube?
*Rain has been here since we watched Blade Runner
<RainBowJack> i found it beutiful
*Pyrexo italic...?
<Randomnerd> Hey everyone.
<Pyrexo> Yay :3
<Rain> hahaha
<Pyrexo> everypony* Heya Randomnerd :D
<RainBowJack> i have found this place for like 2 weeks ago
<Rain> Randomnerd! Someone I recognise! :D
<Randomnerd> Hi, Rain :)
<Randomnerd> Hi Pyrexo
<RainBowJack> i love it here
*Rain has been here since the week before the start of season 2
<Pyrexo> Same :D
<RainBowJack> all of you brony's are so nice
<Pyrexo> I frequent FunnyJunk, loads of bronies there, so it was natural I would check out the show :P
<Dumorimasoddaa> I've been here from the 2nd night
<RainBowJack> i found this place due to youtube
<RainBowJack> MEDIC!!
<Rain> Pyrexo, have you had a different nick in here?
<RainBowJack> lol
<RainBowJack> not Capatalisme?
<Sundaysmile> This is Halloween!
<Pyrexo> Nope :P EVERYWHERE i am Pyrexo. Steam, youtube, etc
<Pyrexo> It's never taken ^^
<RainBowJack> yeah
<KwakLad> nick constitutional monachy with an emphasis on a capitalist idea?
<RAINBOWCRASH> I'm still here no sleep yet
<RainBowJack> but then GHOST would be a Bronie
<Rain> then you havent been active in here then ^_^
<Rain> I hate when I forget that I already used a word in a sentance -_-
<Ictiv> Here's an idea: Horses are herbivores who live in matriarchies. They aren't agressive, only defensive. Therefore a civilization of theirs is a lot calmer, capitalism works much better with them
<Pyrexo> Nope not really >.< I've just gotten into the community, Music, Fanfics, Streams
<KwakLad> Rain its easy to do with 'then' so dont worry :p
<Ictiv> They can also easily stand old style monarchy aswell
<RainBowJack> GHOST Radio do you guys know trhat?
<Pyrexo> Nope
<Jim> He's such a douche
*Rain just read KwakLad's nick in the absolute worst way
<Sundaysmile> Batman!
<Asiris> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfKg5vs18A&feature=related
<RainBowJack> Jim i agree
<KwakLad> haha go on Rain
<Rain> >_>?
<KwakLad> nick he read my nick-name incorrectly
<Rain> he?
<KwakLad> Rain how did you read my name so bad?
<Sundaysmile> Kawklad?
<Rain> My mind sits very snugly in a gutter that is how
<Pyrexo> Lawl
<RainBowJack> you guys in TF2 do any of you know Ghost Radio?
<Sundaysmile> so does mine rain
<KwakLad> Oh i understand this 'kawk' thing now
<Rain> haha
<Sundaysmile> we are very bad people
<Pyrexo> RainBowJack: Is it a horror movie? :O
*Rain looks for her Shizu and her Vivi
<RainBowJack> no a radio host he is a Capatalist and hates bronies to the core
<Pyrexo> I really want to know what "Ghost Radio" is now :P
<Pyrexo> Oh...
<RainBowJack> go to youtube and shearch for Ghost radio
<Rain> so, the man test
<RainBowJack> haha
<Sundaysmile> there is no secret
<Rain> how GAR is Kamina
<RainBowJack> no i am ALEX JONES
<Pyrexo> Ah a brony hater :P And the world keeps spinning...
*Ictiv rubs forehead.
<RainBowJack> he is a Texas
<Ictiv> I just realized it's not Saturday
<Pyrexo> I am also a Texas :D
<Randomnerd> Oh, Lord, not Alex Jones.
<Pyrexo> I love spy :D
<Randomnerd> I don't see how FEMA camps are any more useful for keeping people prisoner than Television.
<Rain> who would win in a battle of manlyness? Kamina from Gurren Laggan or Alex Armstrong from Full Metal Alchemist?
<Randomnerd> Armstrong, by Far, Rain.
<Randomnerd> He's a Gentleman, as well as Masculine.
<Ictiv> I wonder, will this week's lottery be today or tomorrow?
<Ictiv> If tomorrow, I might not stay up until 4 AM today
<Pyrexo> Nuuuu~
<Sundaysmile> she will next week
<Ictiv> (which is around when BMN ends
<Rain> false. Neither of them would get in such a petty battle because they have both reached such a level of manlyness that such quarels dont matter
<Sundaysmile> next week is fluttershy ep
<Sundaysmile> and week after is Twilight ep
<RainBowJack> i like SCOOTALOO
<Pyrexo> "otakon" is the only guy I remember

<Kammerjunk> That we metaphorically build up around ourselves.
<RainBowJack> Nick broke it

<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: I like to sleep under the sky and in a wide grassland
<Morty> if there was a 5th wall, it would break it
<RainBowJack> Morty if your done i would like to read it
<Ictiv> Don't judge me
<Kammerjunk> That's terrifying.
<Ictiv> :(
<Ictiv> :'(
<MirrorImage> Morty - that would be the wall between humans and "god"
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Metaphorically?
<Morty> it has pinkie, deadpool, godzilla, the author, and Dr. Manhatten
<MirrorImage> or in some circles, the wall between humans and Morgan Freeman
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Both
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: Well not all the time

<Twilightsparkle> Fine and you?
<alexxm> good
<Wrek> 05its awesome music
<KwakLad> Got confused i wondered how music magiced out of my pc while i was downstairs
<Whiskra> would've been cooler if you put something on with more shock value to begin with, like csi miami intro
<Whiskra> to make us shit our pants
<EonMastor> forogt i had stream open, was confused where the music was from
<Sundaysmile> likewise kwak, I was sure I paused youtube and forgot this was open
<Sundaysmile> thought this machine was haunted
<CountDoofus> I've got an awesome idea for a Vinyl Scratch drawing, but going to need a million hours of practice first to put it onto paper exactly how I imagine it
<Sundaysmile> by ghosts that like to party
<RobotPinkie> oh wow, Bronystate is working on a pony game?
<Rain> YEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH! *throws shoe at herself for allcaps*

<RobotPinkie> Dumb fabric
<CountDoofus> waaaaait a sec... Pinkie as TF2 medic?
<Inquisitor> ah, i see what this is... dash medic
<Everlasting_Joy> But Dash goes with Scout.
<Midnight_Tempest> for some reason... i can see Pinkie Pie as a radical inquisitor from warhammer 40K... that would be awesome
<Inquisitor> what ordo?
<CountDoofus> it says 'twitch' near her head, so I'm assuming it's Pinkie
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... probably ordo xenos
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie as Voldo from Soul Calibur. That I can see.
<Sundaysmile> is it that crazy guy from that robot game last night?
<Midnight_Tempest> although, i can see her as part of ordo hereticus too
<Inquisitor> a radical xeno.... I could see that, well... we'll see with the new episode how well she works with things other than ponies
<Saturn> 08,01behold my awesome gimping skills: http://imgur.com/bfdWG

<JarlCelestia> 0,5Derpy is voiced by Tabitha St. Germain, who was not aware at the time that Derpy is female and voiced her "with a neighbor's son in mind." The episode (and Derpy's scene) was storyboarded by Sabrina Alberghetti and Nicole Wang. Alberghetti﻿ was reminded of herself in the portrayal of Derpy as an "accident-prone klutz".
<emangamer|zp> PonyGirl_82: :O are you cocco in the loco?

<Golakka> I refuse to belive karazhan is soloable
<Golakka> simply because of chessboss
<Shizuka> 13see what i mean, i can't even spell finger right
*EspyLacopa can solo up to chess boss on paladin.
<Golakka> soloing ICC is easier :)
<otakon> Shizuka: it rubs the lotion on it's fingers to get better again
*EspyLacopa will admit to not actually -attempting- the chess boss while solo.
<unfoundbug> :O twilight in a trech coat?

<Golakka> Theres something really beautiful about Sukhoi aircraft
<emangamer> LadyCanary: oh they were spamming the same link??? oh thats totally wrong. But yea I'm the link spamming pony
<Syndicate> I would call you kwak, but that sounds like a duck. Plus my autocorrect has learned KwakLad.
<LadyCanary> ...
<emangamer> SuperBrony64|AFK: I wub woo so bucking much
<EspyLacopa> Mahna mahna?
<RAWRity> emangamer: hey. hey. guess what?
<fluttershyfan158> also if they gave derpy a voice and a cameo why not do that with octavia? or vinyl scratch?
<emangamer> RAWRity: you're a souless monster who will never love another pony?
<Syndicate> Vinyl has only been in one episode for 5 seconds
<LadyCanary> They cant please anyone fluttershyfan158.
<LadyCanary> everyone*
<KwakLad> Haha Syndicate both are good
<RAWRity> emangamer: INCORRECT. Editet version of my fic is up and has been sent to EQD pre-readers.
<Vinyl> And when I've been in those 5 seconds it was the best moment ever.
<Syndicate> XD
<KwakLad> But only KwakLad pings me :p
<Cypresswolf> bartsonic, blind bags are the little 1 inch pony figures. there are 24 in a box, on sale on hasbrotoyshop for around $50
<fluttershyfan158> good point canary
<Vinyl> Vinyl scratch is best pony~
<Syndicate> That's why I use it. KwakLad.
<Syndicate> :3
<emangamer> RAWRity: 5 bucks says there are still like 5 errors/typos
<RAWRity> emangamer: 5 Bucks Says Nopony But You Will Care.
<fluttershyfan158> i got a funny mlp card 4 valentines day..got it from a girl
<emangamer> RAWRity: 5 bucks says you're wrong
<Syndicate> I will care.
<OhioBronyShow> I handed out MLP Valentines to my homeroom.
<Syndicate> No me gusta typos
<RAWRity> emangamer: 5 Bucks Would Weigh A Lot. Deer are heavy.
<Cypresswolf> there are 3 mystery ponies in the box :) the rest are labeled on the box itself, but I dont want to spoil the surprise
<queen_luna> nikxz gkhzjb jxh
<bartsonic> thanks
<KwakLad> RAWRity: All my friends point out spelling errors and such but in fan fics make a point of following up with 'But it's a fan fic so who cares really'
<Vinyl> :o http://imgur.com/gallery/SXm1e
<Inquisitor> the only reason derpy was encluded was as a nod to the fans... remember bronys are outside of the demographic and as insensate as it will make people the creators of the show can't go off on a fan service tangent because of a minority
<fluttershyfan158> "roses are red summer is in june. no vaentine? then straight to the moon" and it had a picture of celestia
<Syndicate> Rawrity: I believe he meant 5 US paper currency.
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: we talkin' bout Blind Bags
<RAWRity> ?
<Golakka> Dammed shitty flash crashing
<bartsonic> has anyone read cupcakes that weird fanfic
<fluttershyfan158> i have
<Inquisitor> it's not good business
<Cypresswolf> RAWrity, yes :)
<LadyCanary> No mention of that please.
<queen_luna> cupcakes! yesh
<Vinyl> No bartsonic.
<OhioBronyShow> Weird does not BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT.
<Vinyl> Do not mention it.
<Sumica> 00,10We dont talk about it around hear bartsonic
<fluttershyfan158> my eyes
<Inquisitor> I don't read any fan fiction
<queen_luna> i like it!
<Morty> guys no cupcakes talk
<Syndicate> Inquisitor...I highly doubt we are a minority.
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: those 3 "mystery" ones are probably the special edition Crystal versions of Pinkie, Rarity, and Twilight.
<Cypresswolf> just recieved the box I ordered from Hasbro's toy shop last friday
<bartsonic> oh ok first time here
<Morty> queen_luna that can get you banned <.<
<LadyCanary> Then read the rules bartsonic.
<queen_luna> really?
<Syndicate> She didn't know.
<queen_luna> im new
<Syndicate> Chill everypony.
<fluttershyfan158> ik
<Cypresswolf> NICE! but I have to wait 2 days to open them
<Big_Jakeintosh> I just got my welovefine order in today and it had a blindbag in it I got a sperkly twilight sparkle :)
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: funny that would happen today. just got an email that the Blind Bags I ordered from Toy Wiz have shipped.
<KwakLad> Cypresswolf: why do you need to wait?
<Everypony_Loves_Flut> Tara strong doesn't know what trolling means.... WHAT.
<Morty> ?
<Syndicate> Lol ^
<Vinyl> She doesn't huh.
<fluttershyfan158> i got a tattoo of rainbow dashes cutie mark on my arm last week..
<RAWRity> Everypony_Loves_Flut: u been trolled
<Golakka> CCCP, The equestia anthem is epic
<queen_luna> AWESOME!
<Golakka> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=fwERapuM17k
<CCCP> Glakka: so true :)
<Inquisitor> well think about it Syndicate, if it weren't airing on an obscure channel and had a wider viewing audiance I'm sure they'd have more people inside the demographic watching... think about little 'becca's mom... if they fan nodded everything this community came up with it'd either go over both 'becca and mom's head or downright offend them and that's not good for business
<fluttershyfan158> now my arm is 20% cooler
<Inquisitor> sorry for the block drop
<queen_luna> haha
<Cypresswolf> :) Good question...well, why not, lets open some = Pre FMN Blind Bag Party! YAY!
<KwakLad> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<bartsonic> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-wut.png
<fluttershyfan158> no seriously it looks cool
*Vinyl gets punched in the face by bronystate
<Syndicate> Inquisitor: I wasn't saying that thy should listen to us, I'm just saying that we are definitely the majority here. Bronies are not the minority.
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: FMN?
<LadyCanary> KwakLad: Someone from bronystate did that ^_^
<Cypresswolf> Friday Movie Night
<KwakLad> I Get punched everynight now
<queen_luna> i bet it does
<Vinyl> Why is this place so awesome ;~; I can't finish anything
<Syndicate> KwakLad: me too.
<KwakLad> LadyCanary: I remeber it being posted earlier when few people were about, i cant remeber who its by though, can you
<Big_Jakeintosh> sooooooo how is everyone tonight?
<Vinyl> <3 brotherswing
<queen_luna> sljkgjhmkahb
<RAWRity> Syndicate: that remains to be seen, actually. WE think we're the majority because we hang out with other bronies, and frequent Brony sites. But there could be TONS of kids that watch it, but because they're kids, they don't go to the internet sites we frequent.
<Inquisitor> which is a GOOD THING RAWRity
<fluttershyfan158> i originally wanted twilights cutie mark but i changed my mind to rainbow dashes cutie mark..
<Cypresswolf> This requires SCISSORS! be right back :O
<bartsonic> epic cupcake time
<Avillion> hey
<FlutterDash> hi
<Inquisitor> I'm not for censorship of any kind, but I AM for discression... kids should not be reading stuff like the oft mentioned Cupcakes
<queen_luna> hmm twilight just insnt as cool...
<KwakLad> We must still try to permiate into the highest reachers of governments, or atleast one
<Sumica> 00,10I used to get punched in the face, now I get to do the punching.
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> :>
<Inquisitor> which even though I've not read it... I know what it's about
<Golakka> oh btw CCCP, You jelly?
<Golakka> http://www.fu-kit.com/product.php/367/mens-soviet-officers-khaki-wool-greatcoats
<emangamer> ok so I think Mic the Mic might be a little loco in the cocco...
<Syndicate> Inquisitor: perhaps so. I just really believe we are the majority. There are so many of us. Hundreds of thousands. And probably more, considering closet bronies.
<FlutterDash> at the gala!
<fluttershyfan158> i like her though..i don't relly hate anyone..except for trixie and gilda..and thats it..
<KwakLad> Sumica: You got to punch me 2 nights ago i think :p
<CCCP> Golakka: u have them?
<Cypresswolf> 1) Best Pony! Applejack! <3
<Golakka> Its in the post :)
<fluttershyfan158> i really hate gilda
<emangamer> Mic the Mic makes really good music, but his streams and all of that other stuff is really weird....
<Syndicate> My post was meant for RAWRity.
<Inquisitor> I'm sure there's a significant population
<CCCP> oh
<CCCP> awsome
*Vinyl wants a trench coat now .-.
<Inquisitor> alls I gotta say is Smarty Pants is best pony... prove me wrong...
<queen_luna> no pony (or griffon) should make fluttershy cry!
<bartsonic> someponies are still talking about cupcakes...?
<PartyCannon> Vinyl rather a good coat :)
<CCCP> just remeber this one day in Russia the left will rise
<fluttershyfan158> she made fluttershy cry..so i hate her..anyone who makes fluttershy cry is dead to me!!
<Inquisitor> using it to make a point bartsonic
<Cypresswolf> 2) Rainbow Dash
<emangamer> dem cupcakes are good eating...I like chocolate with chocolate icing and sprinkles
<Syndicate> Inquisitor: that isn't how you spell Fluttershy.
<queen_luna> yesh.
<bartsonic> oh ok
<Syndicate> :3
<Sheepy> Yo
<Inquisitor> the moment you look at Smarty Pants to make your assessment will prove me right, you all know it
<PartyCannon> I had cupcakes with a cookie dough topping

<bartsonic> that sounds like the best cupcake in the world partycannon
<Syndicate> Inquisitor: is Smarty Pants some alternate spelling of Fluttershy?
<Avillion> https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/432322_3396965928284_1393816607_33482290_2036059586_n.jpg
<Inquisitor> welcome back Wrek, have a good nico-stick?
<CCCP> We have been lied to.We have been decieved.This "Celestia" is no princess, SHE IS A TYRANT!She has﻿ forced us into neer slavery.She sent our true ruler to the moon for a thousand years before letting her return, all because she wanted a little more attention.It is time we rise up.It is time we take arms.Brothers and sisters are you with me?Today we fight for the true ruler of Equestria
<Kipkat07> hi everypony!! i got grounded for the semester :( in other news, this is the 14th year in a row i dont have a special somepony. :'(
<Vinyl> http://imgur.com/gallery/hWgtM
<CCCP> sorry for text wall
<Vinyl> Oh hey Wrek
<Cypresswolf> 3) Rarity - I think I can see where this is going - Mane 6 is at the front of the box, so anypony having a hard time finding Mane 6 in blind bag boxes, you have a clue why :)
<Wrek> 05sorry bout that
<Wrek> 05my addictions got the best of me
<Vinyl> It's fine, we can wait c:
<sampsoninc> use ebay
<queen_luna> i wonder how old celestia is...probably as old as the sun.
<Syndicate> CCCP3: I like Celestia.
<Syndicate> :3
<Kipkat07> 16 billion years?
<queen_luna> luna is better!
<sampsoninc> i don't know
<Inquisitor> Celestia isn't as old as Equestria... citeing reference to the christmas episode
<Cypresswolf> 4) Twilight Sparkle
<CCCP> Syndicate: shes probobly corrupt in some way
<fluttershyfan158> if celestia is a princess then where is the king and queen? shouldn't she be queen celestia?
<CCCP> ^ true
<Syndicate> CCCP: our world leaders are more corrupt and we deal with them.
<Dken2021> Queen = Evil, Princess = Good
<queen_luna> EXACTLY@!
<bartsonic> if celestia learns something about friendship who does she send letters to
<sampsoninc> she was made a princess on hasbro's request. She was originally going to be queen, according to lauren faust.
<Kipkat07> o crap! moms home gtg baiiii :)
<queen_luna> oops an @
<Pon_Jovi232> What we watchin?
<Vinyl> Indeed dken
<fluttershyfan158> princess luna = evil
<Inquisitor> fluttershyfan158 they addressed that issue... they wanted to make her Queen Celestia, but because of disney fairy tales, Queens are always evil... dems the times we live in
<KwakLad> CCCP: if the entire society is formed of ponies and foals where are the fully grown horses?
<Vinyl> Pon_Jovi232: Where watching Wrek play Might and magic
<CCCP> Syndicate: But she has the power to watch your every move and control the freaking sun
<TheDr> wow i got kild by a heave 2 times
<Pon_Jovi232> Okay
<queen_luna> buuuut shes good now..
<Vinyl> were*
<fluttershyfan158> oooh....nervermind
<Cypresswolf> 5) Sugar Grape - white pegasi with two toned purple hair & Grape cutie mark
*Dken2021 goes back to ninja business
<Syndicate> CCCP: but she doesn't do anything with the information. So who cares?
<Cypresswolf> Pretty
<CCCP> KwakLad: hmmmm.... let me think about tjat
<KwakLad> CCCP: maybe the King and/or queen are with the other adults?
*Syndicate smudges smudge_proof
<queen_luna> yesh i see the liiight!
<CCCP> Syndicate: but the scary thing is she coould. Shes been alive for a long time she might get bored and go insane
<Wrek> 05i love this game
<Wrek> 05rain
<Wrek> 05thanks alot
<Smudge_Proof> I am unsmudgeable, Syndicate
<Cypresswolf> 6) <3 Fluttershy
<CCCP> KwakLad: mabey its like neverland
<Syndicate> CCCP: if she hasn't already, I doubt she will at all.
<Wrek> 05i cant even begin to say how much I appreciate it
<Inquisitor> I just think that use of the word "Ponies" is simply because it's a fun word to say... "Pony"
<Syndicate> ^
<queen_luna> celestia never ages in Family Aprreciation Day she looked the same in granny smith's flashback
<Cypresswolf> is going to hang out on the desktop instead of going back in the bag :)
<fluttershyfan158> i als relized that celestia and dumbledore are similar..1. both live in a castle 2. both have a special student who is trained in the ways of magic 3. both have evil monsters who want to defeat them.. your mind blown!!
<Golakka> holy hell
<Golakka> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X21S0estDI&t=34s
<bartsonic> who likes mlp amvs
<CCCP> Syndicate: thats resonable but who knows she could be getting ready for somthing big
<Golakka> Some military salute, a guy getas his betret shot off
<KwakLad> CCCP: How so? they just dont age? But what of death? and that old pony we saw, wait error in both our arguments, and Old Pony!
<queen_luna> gasp
<bartsonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z365VSUWKs&feature=related
<KwakLad> an not and*
<CCCP> brb
<Syndicate> CCCP: in that case, there's no stopping her. She's a goddess, and alicorn, and controls the sun. I think she wins.
<VinylScratch> >_>
<CCCP> im back
<Cypresswolf> 7) Lily Blossom
<tgl1992> Hey everypony :)
<fluttershyfan158> everything has a weakness..
<KwakLad> Hi tgl1992
<Syndicate> Not Celestia.
<alexxm> hey tgl1992
<queen_luna> the lives of everypony depend on her to raise the sun... what if she went evil?....
<CCCP> Syndicate: but doesn't Luna have the same amount of power?
<Vinyl> http://imgur.com/gallery/0JiPt
<alexxm> so what do u have to do in this game
<tgl1992> So ready for the movie in an hour 20 some min.!
<Cypresswolf> Hello, tgl1992, youre just in time for a special pre movie blind bag box opening
<Syndicate> Perhaps, but what can you do with a rock that a huge ball of fire won't beat.
<tgl1992> Cypresswolf Really? :O
<fillyfillyy> im back
<CCCP> Syndicate: i think Celestia would win too
<fluttershyfan158> if she went evil it would be called *tell me if i'm being inapropriate* molestia..
*fillyfillyy hugs TopHat<3
<KwakLad> What IRC clients are people using? just the one on site?
<Cypresswolf> Yay Verily! :)
<Inquisitor> imo... in the Christmas special they addressed the Celestia/Luna Issue.... when Equestria was founded they took a page from the God Emperor of Mankind, and the Sacrifice of the founders formed the bodies of their new rulers... like how 200 shamans became the emperor, the characters played by Fluttershy, Twilight, and Applejack became Celestia, the ones played by Dash, Rarity and Pinkie became Luna
<alexxm> hey filifillyy
<queen_luna> haha yep
<Syndicate> I'm using limechat on my iPod KwakLad.
<CCCP> YEEES! 4chan added a /mlp/ board
<Golakka> http://images.4chan.org/k/src/1329513048665.jpg
