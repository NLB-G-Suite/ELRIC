<Meanwhile> Anotherguy: Hugeball bag fuck.

<Kammerjunk> Anotherguy: I'm a Mer!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It got canned though
<Kammerjunk> ...I've been playing TES.
<Anotherguy> In elf's world!"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Apperently the makers got a cease and disist from SEGA
<Meanwhile> They existed everywhere.
<Jim> Cease and disist is just a formal way to say "Stop dat shiet"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEd6s5S4hJI Check this out
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey
<Jim> hi Fisheh_Fish

<SpadeMagnes[R]> So thats lame
<CCCP> Meanwhile i wub u
<brony_swan> hey guys
<Jim> hey brony_swan
<Meanwhile> Allo brony_swan.

<Anotherguy> brony_swan: Hi
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy brony_swan.
<CCCP> Meanwhile u wub me?
<Meanwhile> Eenope.
<CCCP> :o
<CCCP> :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what I find is the silliest court case?
<MegaMoonShine> hey brony_swan :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The owners of casper sueing the makers of Ghostbusters because the logo "looked" like casper
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The most retarded case ever
<Meanwhile> That is pretty silly.
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: I was just going to say how silly that sounds.
<CCCP> Meanwhile: u wub me moar than Trixe?
<Meanwhile> Yes but that's not that interesting because I love being kicked in the shins more than Trixie.
<MegaMoonShine> SpadeMagnes[R]: =_(\
<MusicalPony> omc.. im getting so tired.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> MegaMoonShine: this is legit by the way
<TrixieMuffin> 1. it doesn't 2. so a ghost looks kinda like a ghost ........ihave no words
<MusicalPony> need moar coffee..
<Meanwhile> MusicalPony: omc? Oh my...cod?
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: oh my celestia
<CCCP> Meanwhile: :<
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The judge basicaly said get the fuck out of my courtroom
<SpadeMagnes[R]> in some sense of the word
<Meanwhile> MusicalPony: I'm going to choose to believe that you said "yes"
<Meanwhile> Oh my cod.
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: OMC: Oh my Celestia.
<Meanwhile> Not anymore.
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: i hate COD, as a mof.
<Meanwhile> I like cod, as a fish.
<Anotherguy> Heh
<brony_swan> hmm...
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: still.. i hate fish too XD
<CCCP> i like OCD
<Meanwhile> MusicalPony: you're dead to me.
<MusicalPony> ocd funfun.
<Anotherguy> I like LSD
<brony_swan> i see what both of you did
<Anotherguy> Wait...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Don;t touch that cactus!
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: ohwell. im dead to my parents too :D
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/JWzfu
<Meanwhile> MusicalPony: Not sure if funny or tragic. :s
<Method_Fish> Wait, what about Fish?
<sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: whatthefuck
*SpadeMagnes[R] starts throwing muffins at everypony's heads
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: Hello~
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: eh.
<CCCP> hi Deleted_dreams :D!!
<Jim> I had cod for dinner today
<CCCP> sprinkle_GS17: sorry :$
<AttacktheAndalite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYKUlmpHGqE
<MusicalPony> Meanwhile: funny. no tragedy.
<sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: who is that
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: It's so nice to see you again!
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP: O_o.
<CCCP> sprinkle_GS17: Samus Aran
<MusicalPony> my inhaler is going to make me have a heart attack one day..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it wrong for me to think alot of ANY fanbase is mentaly retarded in how they act?
<CCCP> Deleted_dreams: You too! :D
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy: :P
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: No, not really.
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: Nope, because a lot of the time they do.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic for example
<Method_Fish> Welp
<Method_Fish> TIme to derp around on youtube
<MusicalPony> i need to run...
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: So how's your life been?
<MusicalPony> mehh
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: Prime example right there.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> They want new shit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sega does so, they still whine
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What the fuck do you want fanboys?!
<Meanwhile> Sonic as a franchise really needs to die.
<CCCP> Deleted_dreams: okay i guess nothing really happend, you?
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: Agreed.
<Jim> I agree Meanwhile
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I had to change my socks just a bit ago
<sonicandmario85> stop these flame wars both nintendo and sega are good >.>
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: I'm learning to play the Cello
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hey! Generations was good
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic is actually making good games
<Meanwhile> Sonic really should've just ended with Megadrive. But nope, he's still kicking around like a hobo outside an opera house.
<CCCP> Deleted_dreams: really? thats awesome do you like it?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 were good
<Jim> Deleted_dreams, Cellos are so awesome :3
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: it's harder to play than my violin and you have to hold it up... but it's pretty awesome!
<Deleted_dreams> Jim: AGREED!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H1JTB6eHiI&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=1&feature=plpp_video
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And yet mario does the same shit every game and no one gives a crap
<CCCP> Deleted_dreams :3
<PonyNegZero> Deleted_dreams: I might be biased since I played violin first, but cello seems easier to just pick up and play
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: Then again, his leap to 3D was actually good.
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: :33
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hey, SA1 was good
<CCCP> Deleted_dreams: its like Octavia
<sonicandmario85> why do people start flame warson every single game they play? god its getting annoying
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: I give a crap, I think Mario should die as well.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile: well you hate everything so...thats a given
<Anotherguy> Flame War!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And I'm dropping the subject there
<Deleted_dreams> PonyNegZero: Yeah, I agree
<Meanwhile> I don't hate everything, just a lot of things.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So no flame war for you
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: Progress of fandom.
<Deleted_dreams> CCCP: YEAH!!!!
<Anotherguy> Meanwhile do you hate yourself?
<CCCP> :D
<sonicandmario85> BOTH NINTENDO AND SEGA ARE GOOD PROBLEM SOLVED
<Meanwhile> Anotherguy: yes.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Now if You'll excuse me I have to clean up dog piss again
<Meanwhile> sonicandmario85: Nope.
<Anotherguy> Mother of God
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: :(, been there, too many times.
<Jim> Yeah, both nintendo and sega are good, that wasn't the argument
<MusicalPony> im FREAKIN OUT
<Meanwhile> Both Nintend and Sega are crummy and should be dissolved in acid.
<Meanwhile> Nintendo*
<sonicandmario85> god they are just video games that are wasting your life but are fun
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I swear my ten year old dog must have bladder infections
<sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: btw where did you gget those nolan or dolan pics?
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: Depends if you find it a waste of a life.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Played video games all his life, and watches ponies all day. WORTH IT
<Jim> if you truely enjoy games, they shouldn't seem like a waste of life
<CCCP> sprinkle_GS17: i think so
<sonicandmario85> yea theres also subliminal messages inside of them that you cant see
<Everlasting_Joy> Jim: Exactly.
<Anotherguy> Should I go eat or should I stay here to see if something funny happens?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I do hope you're kidding.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does anyone remember Bubsy?
<CCCP> Oh damnit! gotta go everyone!! <3
<sprinkle_GS17> CCCP: ? i asked where you got them?
<Jim> cya CCCP
<sprinkle_GS17> you know, i have a feeling that CCCP is a spy.
<Everlasting_Joy> Anotherguy: Why not both? Stay on here, grab lunch, come back and watch?
<Everlasting_Joy> Later CCCP!
<Anotherguy> Everlasting_Joy Oh my god! You are right!
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 war starts in the chat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGjHsLnUO1U
<CCCP> sprinkle_GS17: oh... googlesearch but im not sure wherethe sources were from
<MusicalPony> :3
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Does this face look like it's kidding? http://derpy.me/sygi4
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Out of all the origonal 151 pokemon Electrode is the most unorigonal pokemon ever
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Upside down pokeball... oh wow thats creative
<Jim> Meanwhile, "Does this look like the face of mercy?"
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Seeing as how Nintendo is the only one of the big three whose status as a video game maker doesn't boil down to a single negative board room meeting, I'm gonna say that "death to Nintendo" is just about the stupidiest sentiment a gamer can announce. >_>
<Alchemist> Im dirrrrrtyyyy
<MusicalPony> i feel like running EVERYWHERE....
<MusicalPony> all at once.
<Alchemist> sorry, didnt mean to kill the chat
<MusicalPony> so much energy...
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Given that all Nintendo does is release the same series of games every year I'm gonna say that they're just as bad as nearly every other big game company nowadays.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And yet it sells
<Meanwhile> In case of dwindling money, make old game with a bigger number.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Even if you don't like their games, their existence is part of the reason gaming is so big nowadays. >_>
<Meanwhile> Of course it sells, people are stupid.
<brony_swan> im gunna go for awhile, back in a few...
<sonicandmario85> hey everypony watch this video :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWGDFGqbyZ8
<Alchemist> now just hold on for a sec. It sells =/= people are stupid. It sells = people have different taste than you.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: And their games tend to differ a hell of a lot more between iterations than the typical sequel in any other franchise, with a few noted exceptions where the game was declared to be a direct sequel.
<Anotherguy> I don't normally eat lunch while on bronystate, but when I do, I do it for you
<Everlasting_Joy> Anotherguy: :).
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Now that's just rose tinted goggles.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Internet fight
<sprinkle_GS17> Alchemist: you dont get it. if you have a different opinion from the great and powerful Meanwhile , you are stupid. weve established that before.
<Meanwhile> Damn right you are.
<Anotherguy> Uh oh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So having a opinion is wrong?
<Meanwhile> Yes. Stop that.
<Alchemist> :D
<Anotherguy> The cookie jar refuses to open!
<sprinkle_GS17> SpadeMagnes[R]: no its ok as long as its the same as Meanwhile , that means your right
<Meanwhile> you're*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> In opinions who is truley right and wrong?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No one really is
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Not hardly. Compare any two non-sequel Mario games to two Call of Duty games and try to tell me the former isn't more differentiated. Just TRY it. You'd have to lie to do so. :p
<cow334> ,((___)),E
<cow334> ...fail on me
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Trying to use "It's less copying than x" is a pretty poor defense.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> In opinions there IS no right and there is no wrong
<sonicandmario85> Meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWGDFGqbyZ8
<sprinkle_GS17> SpadeMagnes[R]: well logically speaking there can be only one correct answer to questions. as for like/dislike, that can vary
<Anotherguy> What is this witchcraft!?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It's not even copying. There's nothing wrong with reusing a character or setting. >_>
<MusicalPony> shivers.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Especially if the character is popular and sells units.
<cow334> I think xbox pc wii and ps3
<cow334> Are all great gaming systems
<sprinkle_GS17> ^
<cow334> in there own type of way
*MusicalPony shivers and shakes in her seat
*Everlasting_Joy grows tired of this bickering.
<sprinkle_GS17> i honestly dont get the fight over consoles, although i dont play games much anymore
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycSJZS5VJIo&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=53&feature=plpp_video
<sprinkle_GS17> and i dont have any consoles XD
<cow334> sprinkle_GS17: me ethier
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Right, reuse all the characters for 20 years. Don't even put any effort into creativity when you can just stamp out the same game and still get paid.
<Anotherguy> Me neither
<Anotherguy> Oh wait
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: I'd like to have an xbox but the buttons are confusing where they are. But then again, it could be that I had a PS1 my childhood
<Alchemist> sprinkle_GS17: me neither but I can see the appeal
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Never did understand why Nintendo gets so much shit for "copying over and over", but you look at most other franchises and they're doing (at best) the same damn thing, and at worst they're copying even harder. :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile: Dude what is your problem?
<Anotherguy> ?
<Anotherguy> Recycling, anyone?
<cow334> AttacktheAndalite: hmm well the game consels controllers are kinda confuesing but you get the hang of them trust me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Every time stuff like this happens you just sound like a total dick
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I hate every other publisher who does the same thing, nothing special about nintendo.
<sprinkle_GS17> well actually i do have some portable consoles like psp and ds, but the former is broken and for the latter i only have 1 game
<MusicalPony> OHMYGOODNESS can we please stop talking soo fast?
<Anotherguy> No
<sonicandmario85> also guys if you didnt watch the video if you got a bad comment about a game or console keep it to your fucking self no one wants to hear it
<sprinkle_GS17> MusicalPony: NU TRAIN SPEED OF THOUGHT
<cow334> ....
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Do yourself a favor and get educated. There's at least several other franchises besides Nintendo's big three which do the same damn thing, I don't hear you bitching about them. >_>
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So apperently Meanwhile is francis since he seems to hate everything
<cow334> all consels
<cow334> are best consels
<MusicalPony> sprinkle_GS17: wtc?
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: Dude, if you read what I was writing you'd get my problem, whether or not I come across as a dick is irrelevant.
<sprinkle_GS17> MusicalPony: haw?
<Alchemist> come on people, no need to get personal over this...
<Anotherguy> MusicalPony Here at bronystate, we get shit done fast
<MusicalPony> Anotherguy: well its dang fast.
<cow334> BUT i think we can all agree on somthing
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: I guess it takes getting used to, but I can't afford a 360. My sis and I are looking forward to Assassin's Creed 3, even though we've never played any of the games before and my sis hasn't played a game since Mario Bros
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Because they aren't the current topic of discussion.
<cow334> call of duty is the same sh** over and over again
<OneTrickPony> hey guys
<cow334> hello OneTrickPony
<AttacktheAndalite> hey OneTrickPony
<Anotherguy> TF2 FTW
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: No, because they're not Nintendo and because mentioning them doesn't play into your narrative. :p
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy OneTrickPony!
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Fox News tactics are worst tactics, dude.
<Anotherguy> OneTrickPony Hey!
<Jim> hai OneTrickPony
<cow334> AttacktheAndalite: hmm well are you thinking about getting any game systems at the moment?
<Jim> wait... is fox news classified as NEWS?
<Anotherguy> no
<cow334> Jim: no
<OneTrickPony> hai cow334, AttacktheAndalite, Everlasting_Joy, Anotherguy, and Jim
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When the hell did fox ever have accurate news?
<sonicandmario85> hey guys do you miss the classic mario and sonic games if your a fan of them? well you can play them again because theres emulators on the computer you can download and you download one of those classic game roms and play it and you will be playing it on the pc :D
<sprinkle_GS17> cow334: im not interested in any of them, except maybe pspvita, but only 1 game is interesting for me
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: That and the fact that they aren't relevant until you've brought them up. Call of Duty and Halo are as bad as Mario and Sonic in terms of rehashing the same thing over and over but I don't hear you leaping to their defense.
<cow334> hello OneTrickPony how are you today
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: Maybe a 360 or a PS3 but I'm considering because of the PSN getting hacked last year and the Xbox fanboys...
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes NEVER. Oh hai everypony
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Because they're not "as bad", they're much worse.
<Anotherguy> Are you still discussing (or whatever) games and stuff?
<OneTrickPony> cow334: very good, how bout you?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I love how people complain about shit being rehashed
<cow334> sprinkle_GS17: and what game would that be
<MusicalPony> madcowdisease.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: How, Mario is older than both of those.
<Dark92Enigma> I'll be here for 5 minutes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> then when they try new shit THEY STLL BITCHS
<sprinkle_GS17> cow334: tennis :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *bitch
<cow334> OneTrickPony: that is awesome to hear my day is going fantastic as well
<cow334> sprinkle_GS17: lawl'
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: But I like customizing shit which means PC....ergh I don't know
<Dark92Enigma> Hi Twilight_S!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Make up your god damned minds
*Anotherguy ... gets popcorn
<Alchemist> STOP THIS NONSENSE http://derpy.me/-FPIX
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: *hands you a drink*
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm pretty sure I already explained how: because Mario tells to actually differentiate between titles. Halo is repeatedly built on an identical engine with some tweaks. >_>
*MusicalPony tries to not be jittery.
<sonicandmario85> i have a gameboy advance emulator and i can play sonic advance 1 2 and 3 on it :3
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite Thank you, sir
<MusicalPony> Is anyone else here a WGI or DCI fan? i feel so alone D:
*Dark92Enigma dissapears again
<AttacktheAndalite> Alchemist: Yep
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: You're welcome. And it's ma'am
<cow334> AttacktheAndalite: hmm well that is wy the invented the mute button you can mute the players to make it where you can not hear them
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And seriously? How much can you deviate from a plumber who jumps on turtles?
<PonyNegZero> To the first pony to pm me a youtube video of a song will have me listen to it on repeat until the end of my workday, or until the stream kicks up
<cow334> SpadeMagnes[R]: lawl
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite Heh, how funny
<cow334> ITS A ME
<cow334> mario here agian for the THOUSAND TIME
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: You have a point, Mario and Sonic do deviate more than CoD and Halo, but that doesn't somehow make them more valid in their recreating old games in new engines.
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: Yeah but I'd probably just play with my boyfriend and his friends. I'm a level-headed person but if I hear a 9 year old playing AC and cursing like a sailor, shit's gonna happen
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: If you can pick up a copy of Mario Sunshine and call it identical to Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy, you're just lying to yourself. But comparing Halo 1 to Halo 3 to Reach is pretty easy, since they use the same engine (and the evidence of this is that Reach didn't even think to disable control of alien tech that they should have no clue how to use).
<sonicandmario85> SpadeMagnes[R]: he jumps on goombas too xD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIyAImqy5HQ&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B&index=8&feature=plpp_video Needs more team plasma
<cow334> AttacktheAndalite: I know what you mean I hate people who just cuss on the mic as well and it is hard to not tell them something back
<MusicalPony> i <3 Halo...
<cow334> me to
<Anotherguy> Mute?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: To the contrary, there's nothing wrong with reusing a setting if they keep changing the formula.
<cow334> I love halo
*MusicalPony hides to be away from arguments above
<cow334> Anotherguy: ...? what
<AttacktheAndalite> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1556/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I just love the annoying 8 year olds who think they're pro
<MusicalPony> halo is my main game.
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<cow334> MusicalPony: halo 4 /)
<sonicandmario85> now i wanna get on my N64 emulator and play paper mario 64 XD
<MusicalPony> SpadeMagnes[R]: I KNOW RIGHT?!
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Especially if people like the characters and want to keep playing games with them in it.
<cow334> hello GilDash
<Anotherguy> Mute the sound so you can't hear people cussing cow334
<Renard> Halo sucks.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: They don't /keep/ changing the formula though, that's the point. Platformer here, platformer there, oh but now he has a hose. Big whoop.
<MusicalPony> cow334: oh heck yes! /)
<MusicalPony> Renard: whys that?
<PonyNegZero> SpadeMagnes[R]: I don't understand - I blew off that 8 year old's face... How is he still talking?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: So what, you want them to constantly change GENRE too?
*Anotherguy burp
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: So if it has fanboys it should be left alone, sounds legit.
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: I've seen videos of people trolling little kids. I lol but if that were me, I'd be having some clorful words that's uncouth for a lady
<cow334> MusicalPony: YES awesome man /)(\
<Anotherguy> brb
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I want them to make something that they haven't already made.
<MusicalPony> cow334: im soooo excited! :3
<pony_0> darn
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: So your core argument is that Halo 2 should be like Halo 1, except as a third person platformer
<CriticKitten> Yeah, sounds like a great argument
<sonicandmario85> BACKFLIP
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Great, you can't understand what I'm saying, that's going to make my job easier.
<sonicandmario85> BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP!
<Jim> I DON'T CARE
<sonicandmario85> I DONT CAREEEE!
<cow334> Anotherguy: Yes you go to there gamertag or psn name and press the a button and it will mute there name so you cant hear them until you want to un mute them you never new that?
<sprinkle_GS17> IT WAS A BARRELROLL
<MusicalPony> stop arguing over a game.
<GilDash> Halo was originally going to be a third person shooter... once upon a time.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: That's literally what you just said. :P
<MusicalPony> honestly, who gives a crap?
<cow334> AttacktheAndalite: I troll kids all the time it is awesomke when they get mad
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I want them to not make Halo 2 and make something else.
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: apparently they do
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: I DON'T CAAAAAAAA-
<cow334> MusicalPony: me to man IT IS GOING TO BE AWESOME
<cow334> awesome
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: its dumb.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: You said that Mario games keep being platformers, therefore all the same. So you'd only accept a new Mario if it wasn't a platformer and used totally different everything? :p
<MusicalPony> cow334: I KNOW!!!! im saving up JUST for that game, nothing else.
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: welcome to the world, there is a lot of dumb out there...
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: So you're the epitome of unpleasable fanbase.
<sonicandmario85> Son:Why Eat Water Melon When We Can Hump It? :3
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Everything has to be brand new or it sucks.
<cow334> GilDash: yes on the pc version it was but they changed it for the xbox versuib
<CrazyHippie1234> HI
<cow334> version
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: ughh i know. thats why i stay with band kids.. no drama :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Can we please steam something?
<GilDash> There's no orginality anymore anyway...
<AttacktheAndalite> cow334: This. I need to troll. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiLfz6HfCfM
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Fun fact, if it's the same character in a different setting it's still rehashed.
<Alchemist> cow334: go to youtube, pick a random game video, make a belittling comment and compare the game to the awesomeness of any COD game and watch thousands of panties get twisted in a few hours.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This argument is getting dull
<cow334> MusicalPony: me to man me to
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Fun fact, no one cares. :P
<Everlasting_Joy> All right. I'm going to go eat. Talk to y'all later!
<GilDash> cow334: Yeah, but I meant like pre-alpha sort of thing.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God damn it meanwhile, you are making it hard for me to love and tolerate you
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: this is the time when I actually get a bit of coding done since it is easy enough to ignore
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: The investors don't care, the players don't care, the game makers don't care.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Seems I've rustled your jimmies.
<cow334> Alchemist: lawl i will try that
<MusicalPony> cow334: YAY! haha
*PonyNegZero nuzzles BaconMane.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: They keep making them, people keep buying them, and there's nothing wrong with it. :P
<Anotherguy> Me is back. In black
<cow334> GilDash: hmm well I never new that
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: coding? haha
<Sylandest> GilDash: howdy!
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: In your flawed opinion.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Holla, Sylly! :)
<cow334> MusicalPony: awesome you have xbox live?
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: ehh... I'm making money, I'm not arguing
<GilDash> Meanwhile: ... :D
<MusicalPony> cow334: yessir i does :3
*Sylandest hugs GilDash :)
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It's sweet that you think you can get to me, but I deal with kids worse than you on a daily basis.
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: ahh.. yay
<BaconMane> 0,5>.> hi
<cow334> MusicalPony: want to one v one me on halo some time?
<MusicalPony> GilDash: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<cow334> hello BaconMane
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nothing is more satisfying then pounding the kids who think their pros into the dirt
<AttacktheAndalite> Can't tell if trolling or serious now.
<GilDash> MusicalPony: Holla! :)
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm just pointing out that your opinion makes absolutely no sense in the context of gaming.
<Alchemist> thank god a mod :)
<Anotherguy> BaconMane BACON! Hi
<MusicalPony> cow334: sure when i get my xbox back!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One kid tried to get other players to gang up on me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi BaconMane
<MusicalPony> GilDash: ive missed you!
<cow334> MusicalPony: awesome
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Don't try and paint this as my fault, you engaged me in this dialogue and you're getting wound up about it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It didnt work out for him
<GilDash> MusicalPony: Have you now? :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile: Would it kill you to not sound so negative all the time?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: You're saying "everything has to be original", but if people *want* more of the same, they should *get* more of the same.
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: it is almost funny to watch...
<MusicalPony> cow334: search me up.. my names SoullessHealer.
<BaconMane> 0,5Hows it hangin
<MusicalPony> GilDash: yes!
<cow334> BaconMane: awesome
<Anotherguy> We bored
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: a bit yea.. just over video games.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm not wound up. You just wish. :P
*GilDash hugs MusicalPony.
<Anotherguy> GilDash Hi I didn't see you coming
*MusicalPony hugs GilDash
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: I say we just watch it all unfurl.
<cow334> MusicalPony: okay when i get the chance I will send me a invite as well my gamer tag is cow224
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: this is almost as funny as watching sports fanatics argue
<GilDash> Anotherguy: In that case, here's a special "Holla" just for you. :)
<MusicalPony> kk cow334
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I believe that making nothing but the same thing causes it to stagnate, if you're content to do nothing but play the same games every year forever then you have fun, but I want to see the platform grow.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm simply pointing out that your opinion is a) a minority; b) flawed as all hell.
<cow334> MusicalPony: k
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite That's kind of boring
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzOmdFIqB-o&list=PLBD41FD360AFD8B80&index=20&feature=plpp_video
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: Yeah....we need a wrestling mat or something and mud fights
<cow334> I am watching CriticKitten and Meanwhile go at it
<Anotherguy> GilDash I'm flattered or however that is spelled
<cow334> lawl
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Celestia damn it shut up
<AttacktheAndalite> This chat needs more Discord.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: And now that you're just grasping at straws in an attempt to bug me, I'm stopping this.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I didn't say nothing should be original, now you're just making things up, silly filly.
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite Now we are talking
<Meanwhile> So what's everyone else doing?
<GilDash> Anotherguy: I dunno. Haven't got a spell check on this chat. :D
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: i hate sports fans... i hate sports really. haha
<cow334> ,((__)),e
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: sports are meant to be played - only watched to become a better athelete
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This stream needs more Mario & Luigi
<Anotherguy> GilDash Not too many grammar nazis here
<GilDash> Anotherguy: No, but I know a few... D:
<GilDash> :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: mud fights, jello fights and see who can knock each other into quicksand first with a poisonous snake
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: yesyes. thank you.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm saying that you're bitching about something that's, at its core, stupid. There's nothing wrong with making more games in a franchise so long as they can continue to provide a good experience. If you don't like that, tough. :p
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite Snakes....why did it have to be snakes
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: I watched some volleyball since I played it - the positioning and everything was very helpful for my game
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: 'cuz as long as they sell, they'll keep being made.
<Anotherguy> GilDash Noo :O
<ACS13123> O HAI :p
<AttacktheAndalite> Anotherguy: Would you rather it be giant Japanese hornets
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBbibpU8bl8&feature=BFa&list=PLBD41FD360AFD8B80
<brony1234> hey fellow bronies im trying to get more ponies to listen to my debut song beneath the cracks, its a discord song. so if u r interested go on YOUTUBE and search TheNebulaBrony
<GilDash> Anotherguy: Eh, just ignore them. They'll get bored eventually. :)
<Anotherguy> AttacktheAndalite: Yes
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: thats awesome :] ive watched drum corps live on youtube and in person to help figure out technique and whatnot :P
<CriticKitten> Rest of Chat: Why does everyone get so shook up when two people engage in a discussion? XD
<Anotherguy> GilDash They never bored
<ACS13123> um... HI?
<ACS13123> :p
<Meanwhile> brony1234: You were kicked yesterday for advertising in chat, you are just as unwelcome now as you were then.
<CriticKitten> Rest of Chat: No one said you couldn't join in, ya dorks.
<MusicalPony> CriticKitten: well, its just a dumb argument. we dont wanna get involved.
<Anotherguy> I got an idea!
<GilDash> CriticKitten: That's okay. You two throw the fire whilst I hide in this bunker over hear. :D
<Anotherguy> Ahem...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB0PtsEMOrA&feature=relmfu Go Black and White Gym leader music
<AttacktheAndalite> CriticKitten: I'd join in but I'd lose withing the first 30 seconds
<Meanwhile> GilDash: here*
<CriticKitten> MusicalPony: But whining about it isn't productive, it's just annoying. :P
<Anotherguy> DROP THE BASS CANNON KICK IT
<cow334> CriticKitten: you gotta fight your own battles
<cow334> brony
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: well, I went to nationals once, so it seems like it worked - sadly my knees are kinda busted at this point so I can't play anymore. Also, I'm guessing you play a band instrument?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CriticKitten: join in what?
<MusicalPony> CriticKitten: true..
<GilDash> Meanwhile: That really winds you up, doesn't it? :)
<CriticKitten> GilDash: What fire? We were just having a discussion. You haven't seen me argue. :P
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Wrong spelling? No, I just consider it my civic duty to point them out.
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: oh i know.. my first season of marching band i got my knees (in some strange way) a bit jacked up..
*SpadeMagnes[R] sets the bass on fire
<Anotherguy> SpadeMagnes[R] Nooooooo!
<GilDash> CriticKitten: 'Twas a joke. :D
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: well, my knees click when I stand up...
<Anotherguy> Eww
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: oh man.. mine arent THAT bad.. im sorry D:
<AttacktheAndalite> It's settled, everyone. Next argument has mud pits, a wrestling ring and the arguers have to beat each other with large fish while a swarm of angry Japanese hornets.
<CriticKitten> cow334: What battle? Maybe one day I should actually argue with someone so y'all know what it looks like. That was just a discussion. :p
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqTXCxq1BVQ&feature=relmfu
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Correct spelling, wrong word. Then again, we're only debating semantics here...
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: ehh... I'm okay, I just need to be a little careful
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats so dangerous about japanese hornets?
<Anotherguy> Fight! Fight! Fight! Fudge!
<cow334> CriticKitten: what ever you say
<cow334> cool story
<Meanwhile> GilDash: If it's the wrong word then it's spelt wrong. :P
<CriticKitten> cow334: Usually the easy way to tell is when I start digging up links.
<AttacktheAndalite> SpadeMagnes[R]: My original idea was poisonous snakes but that's too weak.
<Method_Fish> God, youtube gets a gold medal
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'm not getting into a grammar debate. :D
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: ah.. during winter percussion season (winter type of marching band i guess) my knees got a bit worse, but i mean its not bad compared to yours..
<Method_Fish> Thank you youtube
<cow334> CriticKitten: so you need to bring up links when you argue
<cow334> ....
<Method_Fish> Thank you for wasting my life for me
<CriticKitten> cow334: Also please, don't bother trying to troll. You'd be wasting your time. :p
<Anotherguy> Grammar Nazi spotted
<bronyNebula> hey every pony check out my song on youtube and subscribe search TheNebulaBrony on youtube or click the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0lXZGeIk_4
<cow334> CriticKitten: never said I was did I?
<PonyNegZero> bronyNebula: no shame, ehh?
<AttacktheAndalite> bronyNebula: Hey, no advertising in ze chat
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/26Vmo.png
<CriticKitten> cow334: "need to". Um, you do realize that debate involves....evidence, right?
<cow334> you no nothing of trolling if that is what you thought i was doing
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: I won't die, don't worry...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Objection?
<CriticKitten> cow334: And that you have to "prove" your assertions when arguing your case, right?
<MusicalPony> To every pony: im continuously looping my marching band show for this year... its awesome ! :D
<cow334> CriticKitten: I was just making a point
<Anotherguy> bronyNebula How about you pay me to do that?
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: i would hope not!
<cow334> CriticKitten: Stop rageing over is brony
<CriticKitten> cow334: So yeah, I use links because....I know how to argue. :P
<Meanwhile> bronyNebula you have been warned multiple times, further pissing on the rules will get you banned from chat.
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: nifty, I haven't actually recorded anything on my violin... I probably should...
<bronyNebula> sorry bronies just trying to spread the word
<cow334> CriticKitten: If you knew how to argure you wouldnt need to bring up links to help you out
<Anotherguy> I'm trying to spread the Nutella
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This stream needs more kerbals
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: i used to play violin, but i realized i just wasnt an orchestra kid.
<cow334> ....
<cow334> right
<PonyNegZero> bronyNebula: I don't think you're actually that sorry...
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'd like to point out backseat modding is against the rules, but that would be hypocritical.
<CriticKitten> cow334: Uh, yeah, so you don't know how to debate, then. XD
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: I am, I should probably upload something one day (I took a four year break - the only reason why I picked it back up is for pony music...)
<cow334> CriticKitten: No cause when I argue I dont do it like a girl son I go straight out
<CriticKitten> cow334: Proper debate is *always* backed up with evidence, on the web, that would involved citations via links. :P
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 another fight, everyone stfu and drink yo prune juice
<MusicalPony> CriticKitten: i am the WORST persuasive person of ever.
<Jazmyn> woohoo
<cow334> HOO RAH
<Jazmyn> yayy
<Anotherguy> This chat needs a bot
<CriticKitten> cow334: Sexist. :p
<Meanwhile> GilDash: I'm going to point out that there's nothing in the rules that literally says people without @'s can't make people aware of them. Especially during times when none of them seem to be present.
<MusicalPony> PonyNegZero: well thats awesome! you could be like the human version of Octavia :P
<cow334> CriticKitten: ....Now you are just rageing son
<cow334> stop it be fore U get mad
<Jazmyn> bubbles

<AttacktheAndalite> I understand it's Monday but really?
<Anotherguy> Stop the war I got children to take care of!
<CriticKitten> cow334: Aw, darlin', you don't know what my rage looks like. Again, don't bother trying to troll, you can't
<cow334> CriticKitten: kk
<PonyNegZero> MusicalPony: well, violin != cello, but I guess it is kinda the same idea (didn't AJ play violin/viola in the finale?)
<Jazmyn> iits monday monday gonna go to work on monday
<cow334> CriticKitten: cool story bro
<CriticKitten> cow334: I agree, it is a cool story.

<Shamroc> ahhh fuck it im going back to sleep

<Anotherguy> POTIS

<Anotherguy> God save the Queen!
<cow334> wohoo
<AttacktheAndalite> I just like walmart because they carry Ear Pollution
<Anotherguy> You bloody bogat or something!
<CriticKitten> My favorite place. It's within driving distance, I can get virtually everything I need, so social interaction is minimized! :D
<Jazmyn> mpphh!!mmmmmmmppphhh!!
<AttacktheAndalite> CriticKitten: Exactly~

<CriticKitten> Jim: I've watched the animation they showed awhile back of the asura. The way the game's designed, all races run at the same speed, so the charr "run" looks kind of slow, and the asura run fast and very jumpy.

<prince-dari> Doors cannot open without creaking.
<prince-dari> It's impossible.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Alchemist: HA in response to our image to mine
<Starfrench> Some moments in this game are pretty nice 'n creepy.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> *your
<hen3ry> Game needs more WD40
<FlyBoy> it reminds me of the scene from star wars, where darth vader puts his helmet on XD
<Alchemist> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: :)
<MaidSurge> So, these games are the first "escape the room" style point 'n' click games?
<Ponies47> brb
<Kandarihu> I thought it was Phase4 playing RealMyst yesterday.
<FlyBoy> why do doors take so long to open?
<Shamroc> ok awake for reals this time
<Bronysith> MaidSurge: more like adventure games
<MaidSurge> Kandarihu: it was
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh god damn it my parents are doing it again
<Jim> Good morning then
<Meanwhile> Because that's how doors work in wherever-the-hell-this-is-ville
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Doing...What...?
<Shamroc> its 1...pm..
<hen3ry> You're gonna have a new little brother or sis... wait, doing _what_ exactly?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wish they would quit arguing all the damn time
<MaidSurge> Bronysith: but those go way back before Myst
<Shamroc> good afternoon more likes
<Alchemist> oops
<Bronysith> MaidSurge: still an adventure game
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One little thing pisses one of them off and they go into a rage
<FlyBoy> pentagon: sign of the devil
<FlyBoy> knew it!
<Kandarihu> Doors creaking, it's the coconut effect. It would be perfectly realistic if they didn't make that noise, but nobody would accept it. So the doors squeak.
<Shizuka> 13okay ponies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A toilet?
<Shizuka> 13so i don't horribly bore you
<Shizuka> 13speed run
<Shizuka> 13or normal run?

<Alchemist> Im okay with a normal run
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What ever yeilds the interesting results
<FlyBoy> derpy_pony: what?

<prince-dari> And then the room moved.
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<xxMoopyxx> When i played that game the game had to let me change the disc to number 2 to going to the next part
<Lil_B> good game design is when you don't even realize you have to figure out a puzzle
<derpy_pony> behind 2 of the doors are bloodthirsty hamsters
<FlyBoy> how many times is this going to remind me of star wa- ...oh sweet jesus....
<ekips> the first time I played Myst...I closed it 5 minutes after starting and never touched it again <.<
<Starfrench> Actually, the whole world is moving and the room isn't.
<Shizuka> 13the button isn't animating
<Shizuka> 13oh well

<EspyLacopa> I remember when I first played Myst. . .-none- of the animations actually worked.
<Starfrench> Ikr EspyLacopa
<Jim> I'm an assasin, not a crazed gunman.
<Shizuka> 13ponies paying attention to how the room works?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thunk
<xxMoopyxx> Nice i like how the whole room just rotates
<ekips> move the room so the entrance is in the little cave on the right side?
<Meanwhile> No. :I
<EspyLacopa> And a good many of the puzzles in it depended on working animations.
<FlyBoy> Shizuka, i think i have a solution to the game
<Vordox> Sadly Shizuka my headache makes any sound or moving picture hurt. :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is it rotating or are we?
<Lil_B> Shizuka yes... but tell us anyway so we can see that you know it :I
<MaidSurge> :O
<ekips> well, that was easy
<FlyBoy> NUKE THE PLANET FROM ORBIT!
<Maid_Discord> 11,01A room works like this: You have four walls that hold a roof up.
<EspyLacopa> And I -loathed- the spaceship piano note puzzle in Myst 1.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FlyBoy: its the only way to be sure
<hen3ry> its the only way to be sure
<Maid_Discord> 11,01And usually an entryway of some sort in one of the walls.

<FlyBoy> oh wait, wrong gas
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No it's called "The world"

<Alchemist> dats a lizard
<derpy_pony> five symbols?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> It's a plane
<Everlasting_Joy> What game is being streamed?

<Meanwhile> Diablo
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Halo 10
<Meanwhile> Black Ops.
<GarrettBrony> hey Meanwhile you now what else is Awesome? ....... A swift Kick to the Gonads. Thats what!
<derpy_pony> electric batman 2
<EspyLacopa> I remember there's a point here where it teaches you the number system, and thus what those symbols behind the eyeballs actually mean.
<Litwick> Myst, according to the Guiness Boomof World Records, is the least violent game of all time.
<Meanwhile> Superman 64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Leisure Suit Larry.
<Litwick> *Book
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Super batman Sonic 64
<Meanwhile> Mass Effect.
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord your streaming leisure suit??
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Shizuka> 13now you probably can't see it, hard enough to tell on my end
<Polydunami> Someone once told me that the classic Doctor Who was boring. I don't get it.
<Jim> Battletoads
<Chrysalis> :P
<Shizuka> 13it is a drawing of a man with gehn's symbol overhead
<Alchemist> the alien?
<BronyInstrumental> i can see it
<Lil_B> its a Half Life Symbol
<Shizuka> 13and he is holding men in each hand over a whale
<Meanwhile> Looks fine to me.
<EspyLacopa> Gehn is the villain, yes?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Shizuka: i can see it
<FlyBoy> k back
<EspyLacopa> He's the father of the guy you saved at the end of Myst, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Half-Life symbol is lambda, which is what is used to denote isotope half-lives.
<Polydunami> I could BARELY see that. Shizu
<Shizuka> 13i know, it's not great contrast
<derpy_pony> the first doctor was....different....no bowtie...no mojo
<Polydunami> I meant to put a comma there :S

<RX-78-SweetieBot> >Hating on the first doctor
<Polydunami> You kidding? The First Doctor was awesome.
<Chrysalis> in quite alot of 3d math you end up using lambda for the rate of change of an anlge
<Barbetos|Atwork> "Its a brony! HIDE YOUR KIDS!!"
<Barbetos|Atwork> Over protective mothers.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> wait. Lambda is a actual thing?
<Meanwhile> Hide yo kids hide yo wife
<Polydunami> I mean, he made the whole show popular in the UK.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Shizuka: is your character Zecora
<GarrettBrony> Guys this is not the time nor place to be having Doctor discussions
<TrixieMuffin> are you some horrible monster ? is that why you're not shown ? or is it because you camefrom the book god man we saw depicted ?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Someone trying to solve puzzles?
<Alpha-Omega> I think Derpy is mimicing the alien guy
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> HIDE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No one is home
<derpy_pony> come out or I eat your cat!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> or there is...
<GarrettBrony> go ahead. eat oppelesence good ridence
<prince-dari> Do we find out why they're scared of you?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pilfer the fish
<Shizuka> 13they think you're allied with gehn
<Shizuka> 13who has been terrorizing them pretty well
<EspyLacopa> And Gehn's an asshole.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shizuka: Who?
<prince-dari> Is that a submarine?
<prince-dari> Or another roller coster?
<Meanwhile> It is now.
<prince-dari> Oooooh, submarine.
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[R] yes.. Lambda is booth a Greek letter and name the brightness of Light if I'm not mistaken
<Everlasting_Joy> I hope it's another rollercoster!
<derpy_pony> the protagonist is randomly pushing all buttons on dangerously old machines
<Shizuka> 13anyone notice anything weird about the water
<Everlasting_Joy> . . . Aww darn it!
<EspyLacopa> Gehn is the guy you're trying to find in this game, and imprison in one of those books that trapped those two brothers in the first game.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Lil_B: woah that was delayed
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Like how it's weirdly clear?
<Polydunami> What the heck?
<derpy_pony> transparent?
<Shizuka> 13better
<Alchemist> Lil_B: how about wavelength instead of brightness? ;)
<Polydunami> No, look at it.
<Shizuka> 13it's avoiding the sub
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yoou sunk it
<TrixieMuffin> repelled by the craft
<EspyLacopa> Maaagic
<Meanwhile> Well.
<Alpha-Omega> Aliens
<GarrettBrony> Frieeendship
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Then the water isn't water, it would have to be alive, or controlled by someone.
<derpy_pony> oh...this
<prince-dari> Can we take the fire.
<prince-dari> And smoke the natives out.
<prince-dari> <:
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fire hot
<EspyLacopa> Why so evil, Dari?
<Lil_B> Alchemist damnit!!!you are right again XD I always mix things up!! (and I'm not talking about chemichals ;) )
<Polydunami> Why not? :3
<prince-dari> I just want to hug them. :<
<GarrettBrony> Fire Burning on the Walking Floor
<SpadeMagnes[R]> prince-dari: -50 karma
<Sallymeow1> what exactly are we watching O_o?
<derpy_pony> use natives to test the machines
<prince-dari> If I was being evil, I'd say take the fire and burn down all their houses. :P
<Polydunami> This is Riven.
<EspyLacopa> It's the magical leoplurodons again!
<GarrettBrony> this game is Beautiful
<derpy_pony> it is
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nessie?
<Sallymeow1> good graphics
<Everlasting_Joy> prince-dari: I can think of one worse then that.
<GarrettBrony> for 1997
<derpy_pony> something changed....you are on the right path
<Sallymeow1> its made in 1997?
<GarrettBrony> the Nautalis
<prince-dari> Sweet
<Litwick> DARI IS TROGDOR.
<prince-dari> Underwater roller coster?
<prince-dari> XD
<Litwick> NEW HEADCANON.
<Sallymeow1> yay submarines
<derpy_pony> these creatures look majestically tasty
<GarrettBrony> Sallymeow1 yep
<prince-dari> Aww.
<Litwick> Hell burninate the countryside if he has to.
<Everlasting_Joy> Acursed rocks!
<derpy_pony> this will probably end well
<derpy_pony> what now?
<Everlasting_Joy> That water doesn't look natural. . .
<Alchemist> Bioshock?
<TurquoiseEggWhite> It does, my water looks like that.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Alchemist: before bioshock
<Sallymeow1> ;_; that water creeps me out
<GarrettBrony> who is playing?
<Everlasting_Joy> GarrettBrony: Shizu.
<GarrettBrony> nice
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Something definatly isnt right here
<derpy_pony> antiwater concentrations
<GarrettBrony> whats that?
<Chrysalis> SpadeMagnes[R] whats your first clue :P
<Lil_B> Swiss Cheese Water :/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Chrysalis water
<Meanwhile> Bloody sploicers.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Give them the one two punch
<EspyLacopa> Hey look, a school room.
<Shizuka> 13now this is the part that stuns me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Bingo room?
<Shizuka> 13first, that paper i looked at is someone having a spelling test in the D'ni language
<Shizuka> 13second, there are plaques on the wall with a D'ni letter each
<Shizuka> 13armed with ONLY THAT
<GarrettBrony> G13 B8 I 47 N42 O19
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Oh wow, this is a classroom?
<Shizuka> 13people worked out the language and translations for all the text in the game
<Shizuka> 13in 1997
<EspyLacopa> Yup
<Shizuka> 13mysties are smart fillies :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nerds
<EspyLacopa> I believe this is also where you learn the number system as well.
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13hope ponies are taking notes, also here's gehn
<GarrettBrony> mysties are MST3K fans
<prince-dari> Wut
<shana> is the d'ni language just english with a permutated alphabet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wait until Mr.Krabs finds out that this stream is a toilet.
<MegaMoonShine> Hi dudes, what are we playing?
<GarrettBrony> is that Lyod Bridges?
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-tank-simply-walks-into-mordor.jpg
<Shizuka> 13John Keston ladies and gentlemen
<prince-dari> MegaMoonShine: Riven
<Shizuka> 13lives in minnesota, and is a marathon runner now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is that a politician?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MegaMoonShine!
<Shizuka> 13he's like 70
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SPEAK ENGLISH
<GarrettBrony> Bomb?
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: :D the toilet line.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Lloyd Bridges was dead for a while before this game was released.
<Shizuka> 13now here's your brilliant game design
<GarrettBrony> oh
<Shizuka> 13not only is this teaching you the numbers, it's showing you the world
<derpy_pony> doesn't sound like just a permutated alphabet
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Let me show you the world....
<Shizuka> 13rivenese kids learn the D'ni numbers with a toy that lowers people to their deaths
<Shizuka> 13how messed up is that
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<prince-dari> Well, no more messed up than us playing hangman.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hangman extreme
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Teach 'em young.
<Shizuka> 13quit giving me eight! i want other numbers ><
<EspyLacopa> Arrow = 8
<GarrettBrony> Jonah the game
<prince-dari> Backwards h symbol
<EspyLacopa> Chair = 3 I think that was?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if there's a real-life version of this game.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Left is gonna lose
<prince-dari> Ohhh
<prince-dari> He ded
<MegaMoonShine> Damn!
<EspyLacopa> Chair with Line = Mystery still
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You lose!
<derpy_pony> the symbol where the bug was
<EspyLacopa> Ah, Chair is 4.
*Shizuka 13knows these by heart ofc
<EspyLacopa> K is 2.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ofc?
<Chrysalis> ahh symbols in the bottom
<Shizuka> 133
<Lil_B> |) | is still missing
<Chrysalis> matched to sounds?
<GarrettBrony> KI is 2 right?
<Shizuka> 13the number of clicks
<EspyLacopa> Line is 5
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: You sure you don't have a list on you ;).
<Shizuka> 13Everlasting_Joy: nope, cause i know 10 and up too
<Shizuka> 13this toy ends at 10
<GarrettBrony> coffee table is 5
<Shizuka> 13but you have to learn up to 24
<Shizuka> 13there's a pattern
<EspyLacopa> Arc on bottom: 10
<GarrettBrony> laptop is 10
<Alpha-Omega> like roman numerals?
<prince-dari> Let's test Shizuka's multiplication. XD
<EspyLacopa> Cross is 6
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Rice field is six.
<prince-dari> Cross * Line = ?
<GarrettBrony> window sihl is 6
<derpy_pony> this game is interesting...never thought there were good puzzle games....
<Shizuka> 13line in which direction :3
<Shizuka> 13i'll spoil for you, there are four digits, 1-4
<EspyLacopa> Horizontal. Heh.
<prince-dari> Horizontal line
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ded
<Shizuka> 13rotate the digit 90 degrees and get that multiple of 5
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I WIN!
<Shizuka> 13so 5 is 1 turned on its side
<Shizuka> 136 is 5 + 1
<Shizuka> 13and so on
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> I don't even
<EspyLacopa> Figuring out these first 10 can get the full pattern of 24, essentially.
<Shizuka> 13I 1, DI 2, KI 3, r 4
<Shizuka> 13everything is built around the number 5
<MegaMoonShine> That's a 7
<Litwick> Mind=Splattered across the wall.
<EspyLacopa> Bow and Arrow be 7
<Shizuka> 13people also worked out the letters are based on the numbers
<EspyLacopa> Or rather, 5 + 2.
<Chrysalis> see guys THIS is a puzzle game, not this crap most studios now believe is a puzzle game
<prince-dari> Weird water repulsion
<Shizuka> 13i used to have the letters memorized but not anymore
<EspyLacopa> And it is vitally important to learn the entire number system.
<Shamroc> all the narration by shizu! the master of all things riven and myst!
<Shizuka> 13yup
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A game that requires you to remember shit? What a shock
<Shamroc> also ohai shizu!
<EspyLacopa> Remember? Nah.
<EspyLacopa> This game expected you to -take notes-
<Shizuka> 13and you really do have to learn the number system, the combinations that use it change every game
<EspyLacopa> Remember how in old games the last few pages were blank and were titled "Notes"?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> EspyLacopa: You mean those had a purpose?
<derpy_pony> I'm used to skyrim style puzzles...."follow the arrow!" "arrange the three symbols just like these three on the opposite wall!"....idiot puzzles
<Alpha-Omega> Weird he i splaying game but we do not see hime pop up the text menu for BronyState. Are you using another device?
<Shizuka> 13if this were a modern game, the screen would have shaken just there
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is anyone excited for KH3D?
<Shizuka> 13there's something big in the water
<RADISH> KH3D?
<prince-dari> Sudden Prince of Persia style lever/handle?
<Shizuka> 13those look rather like handcuffs don't they
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kingdom Hearts 3d Dream Drop Distance
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Inb4 sharl
<RADISH> Nah
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Shark
<Shizuka> 13oh hey there it is
<prince-dari> So this is the real version of the game we saw earlier?
<Shizuka> 13never knew it would call while you're here
<Alpha-Omega> No my brother played the demo. Sora doesn't sound like sora ata all
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13that's the real thing, gehn would keep his subjects in line by executing them publicly
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Things I learned from Doctor Who: to dismantle a bomb, pour corrosive acid on it and mangle up the insides with a stick.
<Lil_B> the hardest game I have played were normal Poin't and Click adventures like Monkey Island :/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> is it true pong was the first video game?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Yes.
<Shizuka> 13no tennis was
<Shizuka> 13played on an oscilloscope
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: techancly no
<MegaMoonShine> SpadeMagnes[R]: You don't know that? :|
<Phase4> 00,02i see riven
<EspyLacopa> Isn't Pong just Tennis?
<Phase4> 00,02i hear a clock
<Alpha-Omega> Hello Phase
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Tick-Tock?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Tick tock clock
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: the first game was called tenis,and was some sort of modification on ship's radars
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> pong was just the first wildly succesful video game
<MegaMoonShine> I see and hear Phase4 :) Hi
<FireIsMagic> What game is this?
<EspyLacopa> Myst and Riven both pretty much expect you to take all sorts of notes.
<BronyInstrumental> well guys i'd better be going. homework to do :/
<EspyLacopa> Looks important? It likely is, better make a note.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Good morning Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02morning everyone
<Shizuka> 13that's not ominous at all :3
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> 3rd video game was Space invaders?
<BronyInstrumental> night, everyone!
<sergio_scriptor> Red_Pegasus|Soviet: no
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You mean there used to be games that required you to write shit down?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, seems safe
<Alpha-Omega> :o mom?
<MegaMoonShine> Night BronyInstrumental :)
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> angry statue is angry

<prince-dari> Shrine to Satan? :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hail Stan
<Phase4> 00,02morning Nittany_Discord
<EspyLacopa> No Shizuka, find the red pages!
<Shizuka> 13so if you recall, that symbol was 4
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: no,they would rewite the ship radar's comands and would then play it
<Shizuka> 13which means something about the magical leopleurodon is 4
<derpy_pony> it wants sacrifices
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<prince-dari> The order of a sequence of animal symbols later on?
<Lil_B> the first thing that got the Title "Video Game" was Asteroids, but yes, there were games on electronic devices before that
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Zuul
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if srs about leopleurodon
<prince-dari> The 4th one is a magical leopleurodon
<Shizuka> 13the canonical name is sunners i think
<EspyLacopa> Those woodsman cut down all those trees.
<Shizuka> 13let's do an incredibly stupid thing!

<Chrysalis> are those force rings holding back an ocean?

<Litwick> Fucking pervs.
<ACS13123> It looks like Cheese
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I guess Shizuka SAW what could have happened to him
<Shizuka> 13welcome to crater island!
<ACS13123> now Imma go sleep

<SpadeMagnes[R]> We're certainly chipper today
<Shizuka> 13yes
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back

*Chrysalis throws hooves in the air
<MegaMoonShine> Awwwwwww shiiiiiiiiit!
<Chrysalis> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<EspyLacopa> I believe there are ways to get stuck, mostly due to not having taken notes.
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, ah, cause excluding the endings i noticed it was imposible to 'fail' myst
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> wooooow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Remember when games used to punish you badly for fucking up?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shamroc> weeeee
<Litwick> Now were entering that one Disneyworld ride?
<MegaMoonShine> MAKE THIS A RIDE NAO!
<EspyLacopa> Kinda like if you go to one of the ages in Myst without knowing any of the clues from the library.
<Shizuka> 13to save you the boredom of gehn's journal...
<GarrettBrony> Shizuka I suggest you play Myst3
<Everlasting_Joy> Litwick: No, this is Willy Wonka's crazy tunnel territory.
<Shizuka> 13riven's water has bacteria in it that actively avoid heat
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You just saved the world, what are you gonna do now?
<derpy_pony> sierra games punished you randomly for not saving
<Shizuka> 13they are also highly toxic, so water is boiled to kill them
<Litwick> Theres no earthly way of knowing...
<Phase4> 00,02so rings of heat hold back water?
<Litwick> Which direction we are going....
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sappy-mlp-love-story.jpg
<EspyLacopa> So. . .lava rings.
<Litwick> Not a speck of lgiht is showing so the danger must be growing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> derpy_pony: Rule 1 of sierra games, always SAVE before you do ANYTHING
<Shizuka> 13Litwick: AND IT CERTAINLY SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING
<Litwick> AND ITS CERTAINLY NOT SHOWING
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sierra games have a tendancy to have ANYTHING kill you
<Litwick> ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING
<Everlasting_Joy> Weeeeee. . .!
<Litwick> *high pitched yell*
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> What about the cave force rings?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *goofy yell*
<derpy_pony> good old times

<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: :D
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, the cart ride from crater island to jungle island has two files in the archives
<Shizuka> 13no one knows why
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-fluttershy-should-know-better1.png

<Bronysith> OMG derpy in may the best pet win in the chicken coup
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: That's one of my favorite comics. It falls under "anywhere else and we'd be saying 'no'".
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, do you turn it off or does it turn itself off?

<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I remember not playing Myst and wishing I had.
<derpy_pony> silence
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Like right now.
<EspyLacopa> Imagine if you replaced Gehn with Gendo.
<Alpha-Omega> I think I need to cut my hair
<Vordox> I WANT TO OBSERVE something I haven't seen yet
<Vordox> ARGH
<Vordox> So annoying
<derpy_pony> I remember playing Myst on weed and giving up after a few minutes
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Right, I'm going back to Doctor Who.
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami|DoctorWho: What episode are you on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What about Dr. Toilet?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Let's see... currently the First Doctor and I'm on his granddaughter's last serial.

<Shamroc> Shizuka: OH GOD THE SUCTION!
<Alpha-Omega> Cosmo: Ahhh so much clogging
<Cypresswolf> There's one puzzle game - Scihsm - I've had for years, but have never figured out the first couple of puzzles - not at all like Myst
<Sallymeow1> I dont see these toilets
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> fillys and gentlecolts i present to you Der Celestia's Face http://derpiboo.ru/38459

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Litwick
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> SpadeMagnes[R]: if i could link a vid i would
<Cypresswolf> *Schism
<MegaMoonShine> Litwick: I would pay to see that :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why does the animation only work sometimes?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No non-image links during stream, please.
<Shizuka> 13sometimes i space to skip it
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: yes of course
<Lil_B> so much gold, must be el Dorado
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: oh was that not just an image with text
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cypresswolf: Mass diarrhea. Mystery solved. When Shizuka gets to the island toilets, they'll see everyone there.
<EspyLacopa> I believe this is pretty much the main puzzle of the entire game.
<Sallymeow1> elavator shadt?
<Shizuka> 13i could probably still do this from memory
<Sallymeow1> shaft*
<Shizuka> 13but we have an island to visit
<Cypresswolf> :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Can ya dig it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can dig it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jut barely.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He's one bad mother fu-

<Shamroc> ......oh nuuu!
*SpadeMagnes[R] flips table
<EspyLacopa> When did you last save?
<MegaMoonShine> Nuuuuuuuuu

<Shizuka> 13silly fillies i never save
<Cypresswolf> Riven imploded O_o
<RyunosukeKnT> MLG when you never save :)
<Cypresswolf> Saving is over rated!
<Shizuka> 13well anyway
<Meanwhile> Silly when you never save.
<Shizuka> 13i need to be done for a while
<Shizuka> 13i will get us back to that position later
<Lil_B> well I think this is a good point to end for today XD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wh4t now?
<Lil_B> bye everyone
<Shizuka> 13hope you all enjoyed the first half or so of riven~
<Alpha-Omega> That is what she said
<Meanwhile> Bye Lil_B.
<MaidSurge> SpadeMagnes[R]: H4 H4 H4
<Sallymeow1> what now?
<Cypresswolf> wave 3 BB coming - but where's wave 2?
<Lil_B> thanks Meanwhile :)
<Dumorimasoddaa> Oh man Riven
<Barbetos|Atwork> Isn't there going to be some movies shown tonight?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what we should stream?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Not played that in forever
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Big rigs
<HatchetRyda> Good evening everypony
*Dumorimasoddaa has no stream
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Big rigs would be best stream
<EspyLacopa> It's a pity that the MMO Myst Game never really got off the ground.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Is that a vidoe?
<Shizuka> 13it's more a pity i couldn't get ponies interested enough in uru live to put up with the friends list setup...
<Shizuka> 13i wanted to solve puzzles with ponies but noo...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Anyone interested in Dark Moon?
<Shizuka> 13too boring und confusing to walk here and do this action like shizu tells you..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: If only my computer worked.
<Shamroc> shizu...i would of done it! or attempted to....
<Meanwhile> I...honestly would not have.
<Sallymeow1> so no more video?
<Alpha-Omega> I like puzzle games it's the only thing that doesn't bore me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i would for a while.. then i would go crazy cause i'm not good with puzzles
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So who here has played Luigi's Mansion?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: on my laptop its only a still frame with lyrics in the description from derpibooru
<Meanwhile> Mostly because of the 'boring' thig.
<Meanwhile> thing*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Same.
<Shizuka> 13uru is about the exploration though
<Shizuka> 13cool environments
<Poly|AFK|> I'll be away for about ten or twenty minutes.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So now what?
<Meanwhile> Well, this is the first I've heard of this uru thing, what exactly /is/ it?
<Sallymeow1> ...
<Alpha-Omega> Downloading Fallout 3 game of the year edition.
<EspyLacopa> From what I gathered, Uru -was- good, but it lacked the support or some such to become awesome.
<Sallymeow1> WH4T NOW?
<Shizuka> 13uru live tried getting off the ground but ubi dropped them
<Shizuka> 13then they tried with gametap, actually got through some interesting content, then gametap dropped them
<FairysHuff> Hallo
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Investigate pumpkin
<Shizuka> 13then there was until uru which ran off community servers, and now myst online uru live which is run by a metric ton of donations
<Alpha-Omega> Why does no one want to bring it back up?
<Litwick> I AM NOW LITWICK, THE URINAL KING.
<Shizuka> 13probably cause of how the content worked
<Shizuka> 13most of uru live is already available in uru the singleplayer (plus the two expansions)
<Atler_Tempest> what the hell is uru?
<Litwick> WORSHIP THINE URINAL KING.
<MegaMoonShine> Atler_Tempest: A video game
<Shizuka> 13they tried to do a realtime story thing where in-universe characters would log into the game and interact with people
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Litwick: Nah
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru:_Ages_Beyond_Myst <-- Uru
<MegaMoonShine> Atler_Tempest: Uru: Ages of Myst
<Shizuka> 13probably didn't work out due to people being able to miss important developments
<Atler_Tempest> MegaMoonShine: ah... myst games, cool
<Sallymeow1> so um what now?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So has anyone here played the Mario and Luigi series?
<Sallymeow1> so um what now?
<Shizuka> 13i have a video somewhere that someone took of the day the gametap servers shut down, had a whooooole lot of players in one place waiting for it
<Alpha-Omega> That must of hurt
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJyq1x-5nLA&feature=relmfu
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I'd be interested in playing URU live - making an account now
<Shizuka> 13they knew it was coming, it was kind of a "get together for the end of the world" thing
<MaidSurge> Shizuka: that's one of those ideas awesome on paper but really really impractical :|
<ChronoClutch> wat r all of you beautiful folks up too hmm?
<Shizuka> 13when i tried getting people interested in january there were maybe 20 people in the public city instance
<Shizuka> 13which is about how it had always been
<MaidSurge> ChronoClutch: discussing Myst the series
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So any of you guys gonna get Pokemon Black/White 2?
<Meanwhile> Well, gave Uru a look over. Doesn't strike my fancy.
<ChronoClutch> me neither
<Shizuka> 13but it's too awesome to be able to solve puzzles with your friends, and there's some puzzles you actually need friends to solve
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-trouble-with-rhymes.png
<ChronoClutch> i search wat Myst is nao
<MaidSurge> SpadeMagnes[R]: maybe? Probably will wait for the price to go down
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ...... sigh
<Alpha-Omega> I like the idea of exploring a new world. It's why I like reading so much
<ChronoClutch> Bronysith I don't get it
<Shizuka> 13oo they finally released the source code too
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why do replys come way after I post something?
<Bronysith> ChronoClutch: nothing ryhmes with orange
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I must have relaly bad chat lag
<ChronoClutch> door hinge
<ChronoClutch> peace out
<Shizuka> 13http://mystonline.com/en/play/ anyway if ponies are interested go here
<Shizuka> 13maybe i'll try getting us together again
<Bronysith> ChronoClutch: doesnt work like that
<ChronoClutch> yesh it does
<Bronysith> ChronoClutch: its two words
<ChronoClutch> soo
<Bronysith> it's
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Shamroc loook http://derpy.me/rQnHw
<Bronysith> it doesn't work man
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws the stream on the ground
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: omg
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ha
<MaidSurge> Alpha-Omega: truth be told, my fav game of all times would be exploring a new world and do whatever you want. Kinda like that space Robinson but with less medical attention :D
<MaidSurge> *space Robinson Crusoe
<Sallymeow1> :( no more stream?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So has anyone thought about buying Dark Moon?
<Meanwhile> Depends, what's Dark Moon?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The new luigi's mansion game
<Meanwhile> No.
<MaidSurge> Sallymeow1: the game crashed and Shizu must arrange other stuff
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Luigi's mansion: Dark Moon
<MaidSurge> She'll be back tho :)
*SpadeMagnes[R] is forever alone
<Alpha-Omega> No I do not like Nintendo Anymore
<Sallymeow1> MaidSurge: Well I know it crashed but how long will it take?
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-blessed-savior-of-the-arts.jpg

<Shizuka> 13i would love if ponies could put up with the setup process for usu
<Shizuka> 13uru rather
<Shizuka> 13i got us a BronyState neighborhood so we'd all be on the same buddy list
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic 06 had good music I'll give it that
<Alpha-Omega> I'm downloading it as we speak
<Shizuka> 13it just takes a bunch of steps to make it your primary neighborhood out of the box
<Sallymeow1> what exactly is uru?
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: shit game
*Fisheh_Fish is bored
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Bronysith: It had good music though
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: so?
<Bronysith> if it was a shit game
<Sallymeow1> what exactly is uru?
<Cypresswolf> :) A Uru Bronystate branch - nice
<Bronysith> why play it?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> For shits and giggles?
<Bronysith> ... SpadeMagnes[R] /)
<Alpha-Omega> Can you voice chat in this game?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> (\
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wonder if I'll ever fill this damn pokedex
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Anyway.....
<Cypresswolf> wow...my Uru installation countdown :D - went up to 3 days 14 hours for 1.2 gigs - less that 2 hr & 30 min now
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRPlI4RAGSc&feature=relmfu Stream needs more chemical plant
<Alpha-Omega> I'm downloading uru and Fallout 3 so might take a while
<MaidSurge> Cypresswolf: yay! Quicker! :D
<Meanwhile> If your computer took 3 days to download something I'd assume you were planning on taking down an alien invasion with it.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-how-did-he-know.jpg
<Cypresswolf> I could take a nap and it would install even quicker :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Maybe I should play some megaman starforce for a bit...
<HatchetRyda> the chat derped on me lol
<Bronysith> BEST TEACHER EVER http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-helpful-school-teacher.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why game disks are better: No waiting for downloads (sans patches).
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Except those can get scratched
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My 360 seems to be putting tons of tiny scratches on my discs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But you have a physical copy.
<Flying-Narwhal> anypony got anymore links to youtube vids that I probably never saw
<Alpha-Omega> Well I could watch MLP season 1 and 2 as I wait for dowlaod
<MaidSurge> Bronysith: the teacher we want, not the teacher we need :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's usually good forever (and people can make disked games work forever).
<SirVown> wat is the best steam community for mlp that I can join???

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Despite my massive Steam library, I'm not a fan of digital gaming.
<SirVown> ya wat is it :P

<Alpha-Omega> I prefer disk though.
<Cypresswolf> I want to build my own computer - I'm sick of Vista! - either getting a mac or XP
<Alpha-Omega> Mac not good for gaming
<Meanwhile> >Massive steam library
<Flying-Narwhal> laptops are not good for gaming
<Meanwhile> >Dislike digital gaming
<Meanwhile> >Welp
<Cypresswolf> What the heck kind of OS cant update to the newer version :|
<BaconMane> Ohai
<Alpha-Omega> Except Alienware
<Sallymeow1> get XP :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why not Windows 7?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I accidentaly broke a disk

<SpadeMagnes[R]> It has a massive scratch ring on it
<Sallymeow1> I have windows 7 :'( it sucks
<Litwick> Who not Mandows?
<Litwick> *Why
<Meanwhile> Why not Ronbow Dosh?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's the 360's fault.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why not Dolan?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: Actually thats my fault
<Flying-Narwhal> spade every try rubbing alchohol on the scratch :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I accidentaly turned it a bit while the disc was in it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It was Banjo and Kazzoie nuts and bolts
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never liked it anyway
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SB showed a review of that game.
<Cypresswolf> I have Windows 7, but Vista always finds some *rages*....something to stop the installation process - last attempt was 3 months ago - spent a full week figuring out how to patch those problems only for Vista to bring up new ones
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also whats the proper way to have it set up?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It made me >.(\
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Vertical or Horizontal?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Either should work.
<Bronysith> now
<Bronysith> morrowind. yes or no on buying it
<Cypresswolf> :) Thats why my last set of headphones only had 1 speaker working :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it normal for tiny mostly unnoticable scratches ot appear on the disc?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess.
<Alpha-Omega> Need new headphones. Should I buy the Turtle beach x12s?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You shouldn't get scratches at all from play.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I think my thing is just shit..
<Alpha-Omega> ......so
<Alchemist> got the 2010 version of medal of honor today, finished 10 mins ago. wtf
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wish I knew what was causing all the scratches

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Bronysith: wat a nice bonding moment
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno the fail rate of the slim models.
<Alpha-Omega> Actually the ps3 is a good console
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Slim models?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Mine was a gen1 and is still going strong. :)
<Bronysith> ps3 had demons souls. pretty good game
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mine is one of those black 360's
<FairysHuff> Hallo
<Alpha-Omega> The slim actually runs a better graphic processor as well as a tricore processor
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Hiya
<Cypresswolf> I havent had much of a problem with my 360 breaking - though it has froze a couple of times playing Skyrim
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: isnt the slim 360 the one with the scratch problems
<Alpha-Omega> 360^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> the slim 360s are more angular then the original

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Yes
<Alpha-Omega> XD failure

<BaconMane> 0,5Its fun and easy to play ^.^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont feel like it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Besides I doubt my comp can handle it
<Meanwhile> Really? Looked boring when I saw it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Coincidence.
<BaconMane> 0,5Yes you do
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> thx Nittany_Discord
<xxMoopyxx> cool thanks
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: no such thing as coincidence. only the illusion of coincience
<Alpha-Omega> I'll jion. I just need to wait until my download is done
<xxMoopyxx> be back in a little bit ok

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fuck that
<Alpha-Omega> Ponies don't eat meat
<AttacktheAndalite> What's URU live?

<RyunosukeKnT> UTE live?
<BaconMane> 0,5Ask Shizu
<RyunosukeKnT> Wow sucks
<Alpha-Omega> So hay bacon
<Meanwhile> You suck.
<BaconMane> 0,5Cause im too busy to explain :>
<RyunosukeKnT> EVE > Wow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> <.<
<Meanwhile> Yeah ok now you're just trolling.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled1.jpg
<RyunosukeKnT> nope, fact
<Meanwhile> EVE has all the fun of temporary office work except you don't get paid.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nope opinion
<Meanwhile> And in fact have to pay to do so.
<RyunosukeKnT> in eve you cant grind to max level in a week
<SpadeMagnes[R]> only people who dont have lives wouldgrind that much
<RyunosukeKnT> it takes a year minimum to get into a titan
<Meanwhile> What kind of sadact devotes a year to that?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I got from lvl 60 to lvl 80 in less than a month though
<RyunosukeKnT> i've been playing 6 years, I can pretty much fly anything sub bs
<Litwick> oh sht i need to play rotmg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But that was because I had nothing to do
<Vordox> ...
<Meanwhile> Played EVE for 6 years. Are you still capable of feeling happy?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I highly doubt a MMO is gonna come along and keep me from playing WoW
*Vordox hijacks stream.
<RyunosukeKnT> training is not like wow
<RyunosukeKnT> you dont ... do stuff and *ding* I learned new things
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wishes his computer would start normally.
<CriticKitten> I'll stick to GW2. :P
<Barbetos|Atwork> Wut?
<RyunosukeKnT> its time based, as in RL time based
<Meanwhile> You do, you just do it much much slower.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> <.<
<Barbetos|Atwork> How does it start... er abnormally?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why would I want to do things in a game in real time?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No POST beeps during start-up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford to fix it.
<Meanwhile> I tried EVE once a couple years ago and got bored nearly to death within an hour.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
<RyunosukeKnT> you set your skill queue and play the game as you normally would, and you can log off when you want to, and you still learn things
<Barbetos|Atwork> Sounds like the speaker on the board is disconnected or broken.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> RyunosukeKnT: So idleing then
<Meanwhile> I fail to see how learning things while not playing is a point in favour.
<RyunosukeKnT> Meanwhile: the thing is, if you solo eve, you will be board
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sounds lazy and gay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its like tf2 idles
<Barbetos|Atwork> RyunosukeKnT Thats what I did day one of my free week.
<Barbetos|Atwork> I fell asleep at my computer
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why play the game if you just get shit by doing nothing
<RyunosukeKnT> you can always learn to play EVE, read articles on the game mechanics, etc. :)
<Meanwhile> EVE strikes me as the type of game you don't really play but rather leave open in another window at work.
<Meanwhile> Or apparently not even leave open
<RX-78-SweetieBot> EVE is your job.
<Barbetos|Atwork> And you pay it to work.
<Barbetos|Atwork> =|
<SpadeMagnes[R]> RyunosukeKnT: How about no, keep your shitty game and I'll keep my good MMO
<kidzrul434> hey bronies would it be akward for having a lottery of pony episodes being part 1 and 2 of a 2 part saga?
<RyunosukeKnT> Meanwhile: you watched the Zero Punctuation review on it didnt you?
<Meanwhile> I certainly did. But I also tried it.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Eve was the best nap I ever had.
<Sumica> 00,10enjoy http://tinyurl.com/84vquak
<Barbetos|Atwork> On my keyboard.
<RyunosukeKnT> the thing is, EVE isnt really known for its mechanics as it is known on the community and how they USE said mechanics
<RyunosukeKnT> EVE is a sandbox,
<RyunosukeKnT> pure and simple
<Meanwhile> And really, Yahtzee is bang on the mark. If you really find EVE fun then power to you. It's still mind numbingly dull for the average person.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again sounds dull
*Nittany_Discord 11,01enjoys Sumica
<Barbetos|Atwork> Eve, at least for me, is known for the epic back stabs that said community does to itself for isk. or wahtever.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Great community
<RyunosukeKnT> there is no hand holding in EVE, like in wow, it is cutthoat and brutal
<Sumica> 00,10Eve the only game that gives you time to play other games
<Meanwhile> What Barbetos|Atwork said.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wow isnt handholding
<RyunosukeKnT> bullshit
<kidzrul434> hey bronies! I can beat portal 1 and 2 in one day
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I never had handholding when I play
<RyunosukeKnT> Hey go kill 20 wild boars then go see this guy in goldshire!
<Sumica> 00,10RyunosukeKnT, there is a ton of hand holding in eve now, compared to when i started it
<RyunosukeKnT> riiiiight
<Meanwhile> When something interesting happens in EVE it's usually really interesting. What with their company fleets and territory and politics and flim flam.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That isnt handholding dumb ass
<RyunosukeKnT> it is imo
<Alpha-Omega> My old computer teacher beat it an one hour
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> wow Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10there is a safty system to keep you out of low sec space
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its called a quest moron
<Meanwhile> But getting to that stage takes forever.
<BionicPony> http://www.livestream.com/snappleshroom
<RyunosukeKnT> oh your lvl 30 you should be in duskwood farming spiders!
<Meanwhile> I started playing WoW in TBC and it's way more hand-holdy now than it was.
<RyunosukeKnT> you can theoritically be in 0.0 on your 1st day
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I never had these "handholding" issues with WoW
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: When did you lvel
<Meanwhile> level*
<Sumica> 00,10yes you can but you have to turn off the safty system to do so.
<RyunosukeKnT> and sumica, I admit, EVE now is more... newbie friendly than when I started, which is a good thing imo
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What do you mean when?
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: When did you start playing? Are you Cata? Wrath? TBC? Vanilla?
<RyunosukeKnT> back when I started... you were given the most basic of commands to learn and kicked out the airlock
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I started last summer twoards the very end of Wrath
<Revolution08> Shizuka: gonna try installing uru
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cata came out the following chrismas
<Shizuka> 13:o
<Shizuka> 13yay~
<Sumica> 00,10when I started I was't even in a spacestation I started in a ship in the arse end of nowhere with the text of "you are in space: here is how you target, here is how you warp, have fun.
<Meanwhile> Wrath babies talking about WoW not holding hands. Irooonnnyyyyyy.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile: I never had these issues
<Shizuka> 13also yaaaaaaaaaaay i think... this latest patch talks about fireworks when you have all 12 sparklies... which i really really hope means they fixed the minkata sparkly
<RyunosukeKnT> Sumica: that is almost how I started, I started just after Bloodlines
<Meanwhile> Hand holding isn't an issue, it's the opposite of one.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I fail to see what consitutes as handholding anyway
<Meanwhile> You're so constrained that you never have the opportunity to wander into failure.
<MaidSurge> I have to sleep people, goodnight :F
<RyunosukeKnT> night MaidSurge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night MaidSurge
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Right..... sure....
<Meanwhile> And Heirlooms make everyone so op at low levels that group quests don't even exist anymore.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Have maidy dreams.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Night MaidSurge
<RyunosukeKnT> thats another thing
<Sumica> 00,10When I started eve there was no jumpgate cloak and space mines still worked.
<MaidSurge> Will sure do, Nittany_Discord :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile: Those are for people who cant do shit their selves
*derp_derp stretches
<Sumica> 00,10then again you could also fit torps on a friggate and stack afterburrners on any ship
<derp_derp> hello ~
<mitamaking> hello
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmmmmmmm
<RyunosukeKnT> you arent ... powered by items and ships as much as you are by skill level (both in character and RL) skills in using said items and ships
<Alpha-Omega> Ahh more Brony Music for my list
<Meanwhile> When I levelled my rogue back in TBC I had to go find a bunch of schmucks to take down the Ghostlands elite abombs, now you can just zerg them. The world is less real and more streamlined and that's a sad thing.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01stretches derp_derp. Hi!
<RyunosukeKnT> see: failfits
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Eve still sounds dull
<RyunosukeKnT> like the ever popular failfit: Laser raven :)
<Meanwhile> Yes.;
<Meanwhile> Reality is MMO combat is all the same formula. Start hitting each other and whoever has the blastier gun wins.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
<kidzrul434> why aren't violets violet?
<EggWhite> I like EVE's music.
<RyunosukeKnT> as I said, the real fun in EVE is playing with friends :)
<Meanwhile> You can harp on about skill all you like but pvp in MMO's generally comes down to "Which side has the healer and which side has a stunlocker?"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have friends in WoW So there
<RyunosukeKnT> kinda...
<Meanwhile> Playing anything with friends is more fun than playing it by yourself, that's applicable to anything.
<RyunosukeKnT> it depends on what kind of fleets you are running and what you are doing
<RyunosukeKnT> that is true Meanwhile
<EggWhite> Meanwhile: Eeyup, soloing TERA is a bit boring as I know no one who plays it.
<HatchetRyda> So true Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> It's ironic that I'd be the one to say that because I have no friends.
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<PsychoticDoc> whats with the ponychat tab?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have no real life friends
<SpadeMagnes[R]> All my friends are in my guild
<Alpha-Omega> Thank you for that post now I have more music to add to my brony playlist
<Alchemist> well Im off to sleep
<Alchemist> goodnight everyone!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Still not sure if I should bother downloading this Uru thing
<Meanwhile> Night Alchemist.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night Alchemist
<Meanwhile> Eh, Uru doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. I imagine I'd get bored within five minutes.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I like puzzle games but I doubt it will be interesting for me
*EggWhite has one IRL friend and thats all he needs, to quote a certain somepony "It is better to have one friend of great value than many friends who were good for nothing."
<Sumica> 00,10http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if I could do Uru in my laptop.
<Meanwhile> I don't mind puzzle games but only at my pace.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: Same.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: All day erryday. :/
<Rave|Laptop> Sumica: Yeep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My anxiety issues are preventing me from finding work sadly.
<Rave|Laptop> D:
<Sumica> 00,10well it's kinda a lie cause i did go to work, but I daydreamed all day.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have got to get my dad to buy me a desktop instead of a laptop
<killerpony7733> Sumica you work at a casino correct?
<Sumica> 00,10nah I quit that job
<Meanwhile> He lives in Vegas, ofc he works at a casino.
<Sumica> 00,10i am a Baker now
<Meanwhile> That's all they have in Vegas.
<killerpony7733> Ah i see
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Working at a casino doesnt sound as fun as it should be
<Meanwhile> Don't listen to him, he's lying. In Vegas they eat poker chips.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: wat did you do at your casino job?
<Sumica> 00,10giveme all your friendchips
<Sumica> 00,10I was a cook
*Meanwhile pelts Sumica with chips.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too afraid to work. Fucking horrible.
*SpadeMagnes[R] eats the chips
<killerpony7733> Sumica how is vegas?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: and now your a baker intereseting
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: At least you're capable, no one even wants me.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So anyone feel like streaming?
<Meanwhile> I'm being ignored by automated responses.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<Sumica> 00,10vegas is hot as hell right now
<killerpony7733> ^When isn't it
<Sumica> 00,10it's 110 in the shade
<Meanwhile> When it's cold?
<Marx> Good grief!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Meanwhile: Not saying that people want me.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> sounds refreshing Sumica
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> 110 degrees? That's BOILING!
<Sumica> 00,10the radient heat on the strip is 125 right now
<Marx> They're gonna need one heck of an AC unit over there.
<CCCP> hi :C
<EggWhite> Nittany_Discord: I hear ya, I'm terrified of going on an interview for a job.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Or rather, 110 K? You might as well move to Antarctica.
<Meanwhile> They need the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier to fly over them.
<killerpony7733> CCCP hiya
*CCCP hugs killerpony7733
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Polydunami|DoctorWho: boiling is 132ºs.... i think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm too terrified to go to a temp agency. Fucking stupid.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> You guys and your Fahrenheit :S
*strawberrie_smuckerz quietly moves all sharp objects and other weapons away from killerpony7733
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is summer so warm this year?
<Meanwhile> Why is water wet?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Polydunami|DoctorWho: i know celsius and kelvin to Polydunami|DoctorWho
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's pretty easy to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, but STILL.
<killerpony7733> strawberrie_smuckerz: Fun fact i actually don't do anything that involves killing :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just the weather patterns favoring a hot pattern.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its been hot, but not THIS hot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Redundant statement.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Heat's making the news.
<MelaPonie> killerpony7733, fun fact: how am i supposed to know that?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Warm winter and hot summer.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> 32 = 0, 50 = 10, 68 = 20, 86 = 30.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> iits been up to 100 here in wisconsin
<EggWhite> Warm winter, rainy cold summer here.
<killerpony7733> MelaPonie: Avoid assuming the worst by looking at my name
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> besides who needs temperature measurement systems its either featherin' hot or cold or inbetween
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Meanwhile, why is the sun hot?
<Meanwhile> Polydunami|DoctorWho: Reasons.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Set fire to the sun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to blame the obvious, but that's not the whole reason behind the synoptic pattern.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> 104 = 40.
<MelaPonie> killerpony7733, i didn't assume the worst, i mearly prepared for the worst, there is a difference!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Polydunami|DoctorWho: cause celestia likes it when we sweat
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Geeze, you guys are in an oven.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This isnt normal
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's currently 17 Celsius, which makes it about 61-62 Fahrenheit here.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Whoops, my weather didn't update since June.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's currently about 70 degrees.
<RyunosukeKnT> its 90 here
<RX-78-SweetieBot> MYAAH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Seriously what the fuck is with this weather?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Oh my
<derpy_pony> 17.3°C here...light rain...acceptable weather conditions
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> So that's about 61-62 degrees Fahrenheit
<ScootaChicken> any stream?
<Meanwhile> No.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Not at the moment
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Could use more Kerbals or something
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Gah, back to playing Megaman Starforce 3...
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> SpadeMagnes[R], Back to the Future is starting in 25 minutes
<derpy_pony> here?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm playing it right next to the comp
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So I dont seem to be going anywhere
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> The movie.
<derpy_pony> they promised us flying cars
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't even have flying toilets.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> They promised us hovering skateboards :I
<derpy_pony> instead we got ipads
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> hey is the there a movie trilogy this week
<derpy_pony> yes...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When did they say we would get flying cars?
<derpy_pony> back to the future 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since The Jetsons aired.
<RyunosukeKnT> movie night starts at 7est? right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> back to the future im guessing
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Yeah

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I forget what year they said we would have flying cars by
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> 2015

<RyunosukeKnT> derpy_pony: it depends on whos streaming and events

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> the Summer fun has been tripled
<derpy_pony> how do you know about the events? what happens and when.
<RyunosukeKnT> when they announce them :)
<derpy_pony> can't remember reading anything about them in the newsletter
<derpy_pony> only in the chatroom?
<RyunosukeKnT> or the newsletter or site
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's on the newsletter.
<RyunosukeKnT> it helps to read the newsletter or main page too :)
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> They announce the trilogy being played.
<derpy_pony> hm...ok...maybe I should read the whole thing next time ^^
<Meanwhile> Hey wait it's monday doesn't that mean there's a movie on in like, 20 minutes?

<Kandarihu> I'd like to think he bribed the cop for the amount of money it costs FOR the permit. And the cop will later come back with the permit.
<Freefall29> Tov|Drunk: it was a fan mod, then published by valve after they got the rights to it from the makers
<EspyLacopa> lol
<StupidSexyCJ> cant it mean both?
<otakon> okay, that line was TOO casual
<otakon> StupidSexyCJ: it used to just mean happy
<otakon> StupidSexyCJ: then it more or less became a slur
<mitamaking> huh
<Freefall29> StupidSexyCJ: back then, it wasent a gay bashing phrase
<Marx> But yeah, there's commentary for the deleted scenes that explains why each one was cut.
<Dark92Enigma> WHOA........that last scene was tottally uncalled for O______O
<Unnr> Bronysith: You know how in source, each spread is a predictable pattern? In GO they randomized it.
<VenHur96> I knew it, I knew the TARDIS was in this movie!
<Tov|Drunk> Freefall29: Fanmod of what? TFclassic?
<Unnr> which can be very, very annoying
