<prince-dari> HAHAHA, good point. XD
<SkyRyd3r> Whaaaaaaaat

<HyperMetalLugia> Server failure
<NightSeas> 12"The connection has timed out
<NightSeas> The server at www.lugia.us is taking too long to respond."
<prince-dari> I have no Big Macintosh folder. O_o
<Mikey> oh and I'm excited about only needing one piece for my lab map too for my nerd side
<Stormy> Oh, which one do you need?
<Stormy> I have a few
<Stormy> I might have it
<Mikey> 5
<Mikey> one min
<Mikey> http://www.sunnyneo.com/lab_map_prices.php
<Mikey> I got SUCH a good deal on the one island piece so many people were selling it for 500k I got it for just 300
<Stormy> I actually somehow have two of those
<Stormy> want one?
<Mikey> REALLY???
<Mikey> omg
<Mikey> your the best
<Mikey> do you want anything back?
<Stormy> yeah, I think I must have won them from keyquest or something
<Stormy> Nah, you can just have it
<Mikey> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Mikey> HUGZ
<Stormy> :D
<prince-dari> LOL this GIF: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130746287260.gif (not a pony GIF)

<Mikey> lol dari I love that one
<prince-dari> How about: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130746910009.gif

<Mikey> <3
<prince-dari> Hahaha, love this GIF.
<Mikey> "the lab ray is fired at Anfernee...and he doesn't change at all"
<Mikey> BAWWWWW
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Stormy> How does that thing work?
<Stormy> Is there a time limit until you can use it again?
<Mikey> yes you can use it once a day
<Mikey> and you can choose the neopet you want it to fire on
<Mikey> it could do anything like change color species stats etc
<Mikey> I might even be able to get a draik or a krawk with it if I get lucky enough one day
<Mikey> if you have all the pieces you might wanna try it stormy
<Stormy> I only have three
<Mikey> oh :(
<Stormy> I could probably buy them all but I'm saving my points for something, not sure what yet
<Mikey> mhm
<Mikey> have you seen the new wheel yet??
<Stormy> Oh that really expensive one?
<Stormy> What's it called again?
<Mikey> yeah @__@;
<Mikey> wheel of extravagance
<Stormy> I was going to try it, but the wheels usually rip me off
<Mikey> yeahh
<Stormy> Especially the wheel of Knowledge
<Stormy> I hate that one
<Mikey> right now I'm throwing all my money away at bilge dice
<Mikey> I actually do alright on that one sometimes
<Stormy> *pay 500 points* "Good job taking such good care of your Neopet!"
<Mikey> if I get a book I'll just sell it and sometimes I'll get a little more than what I spent on the wheel
<Mikey> the one that rips me off is the faerie one
<Mikey> 	A green scorchio flies past and says 'Hope you are having fun!'
<Stormy> I got one yesterday where a bug said it would eat all my pets' food when I'm not looking
<Mikey> XD
<Stormy> OK bug, you do that :P
<Mikey> I also get the one with the crazy ass chias going OMFG ____ IS PLAYING 2NITE @ DA CLUBBBB

<Soyuz> Altair; hai
<drf|laptop> 03wow @ this Unsolved Mysteries case
<drf|laptop> 03I walked into the middle of it, but wow
<drf|laptop> 03it's this mother who went insane, killed her own kids, and then died - either by suicide or homicide
<Mikey> I'm at the point in the game though where if I win I get 2000 np though
<Mikey> so w/e
<Stormy> I've never played that game
<Stormy> is it another one of those chance ones?
<Mikey> it's strangely addicting
<Mikey> yeah it is
<Stormy> I always lose money from those
<Mikey> yeahh
<Mikey> there's 2 avs for it too
<Quanyails> 7>>
<Quanyails> 7<<
<Mikey> one of them you get randomly when you score 24 points
<Mikey> and the other one is if you win 10 games in a row
<drf|laptop> 03oh wait
<drf|laptop> 03that's what the jury was saying, the only evidence is that the kids died, and the mother said it was a break-in
<Stormy> How do you play this? o.o
<Stormy> I don't get it
<Mikey> you NEED to pick a 1 and 4 when you see it, and then choose the highest number that you have and roll
<Stormy> Oh
<Stormy> haha I'm terrible at this
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Mikey> OMG
<Mikey> I GOT THE AC

<Mikey> EXCEPT I WANT TO
<Mikey> SO
<Mikey> WHATEVER
<Mikey> need to get all my money back
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Stormy> I've been playing that habitarium game
<Stormy> it's so pointless
<Mikey> bahh I don't get that game :C
<Stormy> you barely have to do anything
<Mikey> it's the equivalent of watching a pet goldfish swim around and feed it 3 times a day but still sitting there watching it for 24 hours
<Stormy> pretty much
<Mikey> yeah, the only reason I even tried it was for the game challenge a few months ago
<Stormy> I just leave it on whenever I have my computer on
<Mikey> I wish I had more trophies :(
<Stormy> which explains why the neofriends list thing says I've been online for like 5 hours
<Mikey> XDD
<prince-dari> So I herd u liek neopets?
<Mikey> yup
<Mikey> is it just me or is neopets not loading userlookups?
<Stormy> It seems extra slow today
<Stormy> habitarium is taking forever too
<prince-dari> Was playing with that akinator thing earlier today with my sister.
<prince-dari> We managed to get penis, lawl (we be so mature).
<Stormy> I thought it had to be a character :P
<prince-dari> It can be pretty much anything that's alive.
<prince-dari> We got virus too.
<Mikey> omg
<Mikey> http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/62540207.gif
<Stormy> O_o hahaha
<prince-dari> LOL
<Mikey> luv bellsprout
<Stormy> Oh Spyroforum
<Stormy> phpBB : Critical Error
<Stormy> Could not connect to the database
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Soyuz> ohai
<Stormy> that used to happen ALL THE TIME
<prince-dari> SR probably decided "Why am I losing money on this?".
<prince-dari> And downgraded the hosting.
<Stormy> I just talked to him today about some guy that needed to be banned
<Stormy> Maybe he did something weird
<Stormy> And accidentally caused that error
<prince-dari> He just banned "*".
<prince-dari> XD
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> haha
<RedDragonX> figures
<RedDragonX> he cares very deeply about his investments
<Stormy> He did ban a whole ISP just to get the one guy
<Stormy> "Maybe it'll ban Aceedwin too, bonus"
<prince-dari> LOL fail.
<RedDragonX> nice
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> now he has something else to deal with
<prince-dari> I was going for scyther, and it came up with rayquaza.
<Stormy> I said if anyone complains it's not my fault
<Stormy> He said if anyone complains I should tell them to email no-reply@spyroforum.com
<Quanyails> 7Blame a lack of TST for my presence. :P
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> That's a bit harsh.
<Skylands> 10So TST's servers are down? Or is it just my computer?
<Stormy> When he wants to do something there's really no persuading him any other way
<Stormy> Unless you want a huge argument
<Quanyails> 7It's TST in its entirety.
<Quanyails> 7Unless we're both facing the same problem.
<Stormy> And he blamed all the arguments on me. right
<Mikey> lol I can't connect either
<RedDragonX> I'm talking to him n ow
<Spyrorocks> Aristeo, is the mysql server on bradsbox down
<Spyrorocks> www.spyroforum.com
<Stormy> Oh, that explains it
<Stormy> He's moving the database server
<prince-dari> Somewhere cheaper? :P
<Stormy> I think bradsbox.com is his own host
<RedDragonX> it's been there
<Stormy> thought it was already there
<RedDragonX> he thinks the Mysql is just malfunctioning
<Stormy> ohh
<Stormy> yeah, i misread that
<Stormy> I wonder why he only asks Aristeo though, XD
<RedDragonX> because Aristeo has access to it
<Stormy> Anyone could click the link and tell him it's down

<Hipster_Brony> 8doing what now?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm making a site for an RP that me and my local friends are doing.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, cool
<SirSprinkles> 6It's annoying since I'm just starting it today so I have to do all the tedious, not fun stuff now.
<SirSprinkles> 6But I'll get to do the fun stuff later.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, to me it would all seem tedious
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i suppose what im doing would probably seem tedious to you
<Hipster_Brony> 8and most other people
<SirSprinkles> 6...I have like seven chat windows open, so sorry if I'm unresponsive.
<Quanyails> 7On another note, it's going to be >95 degrees Fahrenheit tomorrow and the day after. O.i

<Hipster_Brony> 8no probz
<Hipster_Brony> 8im barely focusing on this chat as it is

<Quanyails> 7Either or both?
<Armageddon> either

<Armageddon> no problems
<Armageddon> anyway
*Armageddon slaps Altair around with a fish

<Armageddon> I'm hoping that works but I don't have mibbit access atm, school is a bitch
<Ascendant> hurp
<Skylands> 10Still strange how mIRC won't connect
<prince-dari> So put tor on a USB.
<Ascendant> Skylands lol
<Ascendant> try go to cmd and type ipconfig /flushdns
<Ascendant> and then try connect with mIRC
<Ascendant> what message are you getting with mIRC?
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> tor doesn't work
<Aristeo> I'm here now
<prince-dari> Then you're doing it wrong. :P
<Armageddon> I'm on a local admin account so I don't need it on a USB

<Armageddon> then find a tor IP that's not blocked and then try use it
<Ascendant> lol you're doing it wrong
<prince-dari> Pfft, they can't block everything.
<Ascendant> -> /server 67.21.84.209

<Ascendant> notice that, because the nameservers aren't replying to your request and telling you the IP to connect to

<Armageddon> o-o
<Armageddon> okay thanks
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> it's not fucking up bind9 that I'm worried about
<Armageddon> because configuring it isn't that hard
<Armageddon> it's just after I get the VPS provider to switch the nameservers, if mine isn't configured properly then it's screwed
<prince-dari> If I remember right I had to pastebin ~10 different files for you. :P
<Armageddon> yeah pretty much
<Armageddon> I figured out how to configure all the other stuff now though
<Armageddon> I had to configure bind9 for Altair's server as his router was being a cock
<Armageddon> wasn't resolving the reverse stuff of IPs and everything
<Armageddon> causing problems for ZNC and IRC
<Armageddon> uh, unrealircd
<prince-dari> I could test out IPv6 to see if I can get it working right.
<Armageddon> that'd be nice
<Armageddon> I'm more concerned about whether I'd fuck everything up
<Armageddon> because apparently you have to register your nameservers with ARIN or something
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Armageddon> and if I don't configure my shit correctly it won't work very well
<Armageddon> because since i have so many IPv6 IPs, I'm not going to ask the VPS provider to change every single reverse DNS lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8i went to subway a little while ago, and holy christ is it hot outside!
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was only like 90 when i left work
<Armageddon> there's something like...18 quintillion. yeah, I REALLY want to submit 18 quintillion support tickets lol

<Hipster_Brony> 8to give you an idea of how small it is
<Lambda> I had to sign in via shaymin
<Stormy> ah
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow... that... kinda sucks.
<Stormy> maybe it's related to whatever SR and Aristeo are doing with that server
<Stormy> probably
<prince-dari> I thought Aristeo shut down a server.
<Lambda> yeah, probably
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks: I have a strong feeling that whatever server that Dragonite is on is really old hardware

<Stormy> I don't want to pay for it though :P
<SirSprinkles> 6That's not bad at all.
<prince-dari> It's free.
<Stormy> I downloaded it once
<Stormy> It kept bugging me to pay $30 or something
<prince-dari> It has a guilt 'please buy license' message when you open it.
<Stormy> it was annoying
<prince-dari> Since I hardly ever have to open it, no problems there.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a place to sleep and surf ponychan, thats really all i need right now
<SirSprinkles> 6I've got a place to sleep. And a place down the street for ponychan. So I'm good. Even if my place to sleep is a couch.
<Hipster_Brony> 8my bed isnt much better than a couch
<SirSprinkles> 6I actually have trouble sleeping in real beds I'm so used to couches... >.<;
<SirSprinkles> 6For like, 8 years I've been sleeping on couches.
<Hipster_Brony> 8fair enough lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant sleep anywhere except a bed
<Hipster_Brony> 8camping is a nightmare
<SirSprinkles> 6I can sleep standing up.
<SirSprinkles> 6Did so in my junior year in highschool.
<Chimera> 04mew
<SirSprinkles> 6During trig.
<SirSprinkles> 6Was awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8wut
<Hipster_Brony> 8how
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont even...
<SirSprinkles> 6For like, five minutes.
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to sleep in class everyday because I knew the lessons, essentially.
<SirSprinkles> 6One day, teacher told me to stand in the back of the room, wasn't allowed to lean against the wall.
<SirSprinkles> 6After about ten minutes I was so bored I fell asleep standing up.
<SirSprinkles> 6Five minutes later she yelled at me and woke me up.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8that'll teach em
<SirSprinkles> 6After that she just left me alone.
<SirSprinkles> 6That was about a month into the school year.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had a high school teacher who would mess with people if they fell asleep in class
<Hipster_Brony> 8one time he had everyone in the class go and stand out in the hall, then turned the lights off and closed the shades

<Hipster_Brony> 8because MPP stands for merriweather post pavilion, which is my favorite album of all time, and pony because ponies
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do you mean you can get it for me?
<SirSprinkles> 6Does it have to be aligned to the left?

<Stormy> well yeah, but I thought it was SR's server
<Aristeo> It's a server problem, not a spyroforum problem
<Stormy> I'm confused
<Aristeo> I'm fixing it for him

<Stormy> Best Night Ever

*eXAKR gives Damos a Reshiram for no reason

<Lambda> How was the movie?
<prince-dari> I see. My condolences for your lost youth.
<Lambda> I've heard it's really good
<Neon> It was much better than I was expecting.
<Neon> Sort of rejected the comic storyline in some respects, but held very true for the most part.
<Neon> My biggest pet peeve was some of the recasts looking nothing like their previous incarnations.
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> like Beast
<Quack|2> oi
<Lambda> looks nothing like Kelsey Grammar
<Neon> Exactly. Mystique, too. Stryker is now on his third actor... :/
<Lambda> haha
<prince-dari> Did SF get fixed by the way?
<Lambda> nope
<Lambda> not yet
<Stormy> Aristeo's still working on it
<Lambda> I've been waiting to post to it
<Stormy> which makes me wonder why SR isn't working on it himself
<Neon> The dude who voices Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell was in it for a bit.
<Lambda> Michael Ironside?
<Lambda> Nice
<Neon> Yeah.
<Neon> Didn't know if you'd know him by name.
<Stormy> Ew, Xmen
<Stormy> boring
<Lambda> I played splinter cell a bit back in my time
<Lambda> :<
<prince-dari> I think I've seen the first two of the Xmen films.
<Neon> The acting was pretty superb. I'm finding it difficult not to spoil anything right now.
*SheenaFox points a finger at Aero
<SheenaFox> YOU again
<RedDragonX> I hate all of you
<AeroDracohem> ME
<Lambda> haha
<RedDragonX> so muc
<SheenaFox> YOU
<Lambda> We hate you too
<Lambda> thanks
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> Do you hate Xmen too?
<Aero|AFK> MEEE
<prince-dari> Why do you hate use now?
<prince-dari> us*
<SheenaFox> DINNER?
<prince-dari> We're not even talking about ponies.
<Aero|AFK> FO SHO
<prince-dari> :P
<RedDragonX> I haven't seen the new one yet
<SheenaFox> COOLIO
<RedDragonX> heard it was decent
<Stormy> I haven't seen any of them
<Lambda> dari: for RDX hate means he thinks we're cool
<Neon> You hate me because you don't understand me. Humans have always feared what they could not understand. I am a mutants, yes... but I am the future.
<RedDragonX> yes yes
<Neon> *mutant
<prince-dari> Oh, so he thought we were cool for talking about ponies.
<Stormy> I just have a hard time taking anything with the name "X-men" seriously to be honest"
<RedDragonX> my mentality is very backwards sometimes
<Stormy> I dunno
<Damos> LOL
<Neon> Stormy: Eh, can't help the title. The ratio of males the females in the series doesn't fit the title, either. They're about even.
<RedDragonX> The Wii 2 is looking pretty badass
<Neon> *males to females
<Lambda> X-Humans
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> RDX: Indeed
<Neon> Wii-U looks AWFUL.
<Lambda> I want one
<Lambda> really?
<Lambda> how so?
<Neon> Sorry, had to burst that out.
<Stormy> o.o
<Lambda> I think it looks epic
<Stormy> I tihnk it looks cool
<Neon> Looks, yes.
<Stormy> cool, epic
<RedDragonX> granted by then Sony and Microsoft will come out with better consoles
<Neon> Functions the same if not worse than current consoles.
<RedDragonX> still looks oold though
<Stormy> Didn't sony say they weren't working on a new console any time soon?
<RedDragonX> Well Nintendo is always a generation behind on the console game
<Neon> But at least Nintendo is finally using HDMI.
<Lambda> Stormy: I heard the opposite
<RedDragonX> idc
<Stormy> what, really?
<RedDragonX> All I want to know is if KH3 will come out on that or PS3
<Stormy> I thought it was you who showed me they weren't
<Lambda> I heard they said there's still a lot of life left in the PS3
<Stormy> No, that's what I said
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> I read it too fast
<Stormy> They're /not/ making a new one
<Guest67655> hey Aristeo
<Aristeo> Hey
<Lambda> then yes I did hear that
<Stormy> Not sure about Xbox
<Stormy> and don't really care either
<Neon> Xbox isn't. Kinect was all they needed.
<Lambda> yeah
<spyrorocks> major issues?
<Neon> They plan to just keep updating the same console.
<Aristeo> Yeah
<RedDragonX> zip a dee do da
<Neon> Which saves us from being milked by Microsoft, I guess.
<prince-dari> Kinect meh. PS Move meh. New wii meh.
<spyrorocks> crap.
<Lambda> Nintendo's the only one upgrading
<Stormy> It's better that way for those two
<Neon> At least in that tiny area.
<Lambda> aggreed
<Stormy> The Wii could use an update though
<Stormy> Definitely
<Lambda> they have the online ability that can be used to update
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Neon> Yeah, Nintendo needs to catch up and try to appeal to more than just the non-gaming crowd.
<Stormy> before I saw the trailers I thought the new controller thing looked stupid
<RedDragonX> epic SR quote for sure
<Lambda> same here
<Lambda> what did he say?
*RedDragonX points to epic chat
<Neon> They focused so much on demographics that never really bought video games that they forgot about their original following: people who already WERE.
<Lambda> not in epic-chat
<Stormy> [21:24:55] <+spyrorocks> major issues?
<Stormy> [21:24:58] <+Aristeo> Yeah
<Stormy> [21:25:11] <+spyrorocks> crap.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> Neon: I felt that way too until I actually got a Wii
<RedDragonX> funny his fucking database is the one fucked up and he can't even bother to fix it himself anyways
<Lambda> Nintendo consoles may not be advanced
<Lambda> but they make great games for them
<RedDragonX> make poor Aristeo do it
<Stormy> Why can't he fix it himself?
<Neon> :O Great games? I can count on one hand the titles I actually like for Wii...
<Stormy> Just doesn't want to?
<prince-dari> Pretty much everyone bought a wii (good for Nintendo), but I find that most people stopped using theirs after less than a year.
<Stormy> I don't get it
<RedDragonX> because I think the server belongs to Aristeo
<RedDragonX> that supports the forum
<Stormy> Aristeo said it belongs to SR
<RedDragonX> hm
<prince-dari> They seemed like a good idea, but when it comes down to it for 'proper' games, I just prefer a normal controller.
<Stormy> And he's fixing it for him
<RedDragonX> well then I suppose he thinks Aristeo is better with MYsql then him
<Neon> Thank you, Dari. xD
<Lambda> prince_dari I do agree with you on that front
<Stormy> Lol
<Stormy> Like he'd ever be humble enough to admit something like that
<RedDragonX> most likely not
<Lambda> I'm just saying that there are still a lot of good games on the Wii despite that
<Lambda> most of them Mario games, sure
<Neon> I just... can't agree to that.
<Lambda> but still
<Lambda> sure not many, if any, good hardcore games
<Stormy> Yeah
<Lambda> but sometimes I want something that's just fun
<Stormy> The Wii is just fun
<Lambda> without being taken seriously
<Stormy> It's like Spyro
<Lambda> right
<Neon> Are games ever to be taken seriously?
<Lambda> I think some are
<RedDragonX> Aristeo says he's more familiar with the Linux command lines then SR is so he takes care of the database section of the server
<Stormy> Games with serious stories, yeah
<Stormy> I don't play too many of those
<Neon> I mercilesslymake fun of eve the games I love, with brilliant plots.
<Neon> *even
<Lambda> well, me too
<Stormy> Oh yeah, so do I
<Lambda> but I do the same with books and movies
<Lambda> I still take them seriously though
<Stormy> but you can still take them somewhat seriously at the same time
<Lambda> yeah
<Neon> I pretty much only take the multiplayer aspect seriously, and that's only if I want to excel in the game.
<Stormy> You don't have to choose between making a joke of everything and making something serious fcking business
<Lambda> that's the part I tend to not take seriously
<Lambda> :P
<RedDragonX> SR might have to get a new server
<Lambda> multiplayer I treat as one of those "just for fun" aspects of gaming
<Stormy> About time
<Stormy> Dragonite is always the one that dies
<prince-dari> Lambda: But what about your poor K/D ratio?!?!? :P
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> maybe it will make him actually change something for once
<Chimera> 04meow
<Stormy> I don't get why he didn't get a new one before this
<Stormy> doubt it
<Lambda> my K/D ratios tend to suck
<Stormy> We'll get a new server, maybe
<RedDragonX> because he's too stubborn to do it
<Neon> SR has finally outgrown his little chrysalis.
<Lambda> but they don't mean anything to me really
<Stormy> the end users will see no difference
<prince-dari> Yeah, I was being sarcastic.
<RedDragonX> or doesn't see any "gain" in doing it
<Lambda> haha
<RedDragonX> IT'S NOT A TUMOR
<Neon> But he's still in denial that the walls are tearing.
<RedDragonX> btw the electronic sheep screensaver is awesome
<Lambda> electronic sheep?
<Neon> Do andriods dream of them?
<Neon> *androids
<RedDragonX> computer dreams supposedly
<Lambda> oh no
<Lambda> kill them with fire
<Lambda> jk
<RedDragonX> http://electricsheep.org/
<RedDragonX> electric sheep
<RedDragonX> whatever
<Neon> That's the book Blade Runner is based on...
<prince-dari> Kind of looks like weird fractals.
<Stormy> that sounds really cool actually
<RedDragonX> I got it on two of my computers now
<RedDragonX> pretty cool stuff
<Stormy> two of your computers?
<Stormy> How many do you have?
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> four
<RedDragonX> with one that doesn't work
<prince-dari> O_o
<RedDragonX> so five
<Stormy> I have two
<Lambda> I have one...
<Lambda> I is jealous
<Stormy> netbook and big fat 17 inch laptop
<RedDragonX> two desktops and three notebooks
<Lambda> jeeze
<Stormy> And I thought my two were excessive
<Stormy> XD
<prince-dari> There are 4 in the house, only 1 that I own though.
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> I counted up all the computers in our house once
<Lambda> dari: same here
<Stormy> I think there were 8
<Stormy> not counting my dad's smartphone
<prince-dari> O_o
<RedDragonX> well if I count for us
<RedDragonX> we have...
<Lambda> actually wait
<RedDragonX> 11
<Lambda> only 3 in this house
<Lambda> one being mine
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<Lambda> Stormy: seriously?
<Stormy> Yeah
<prince-dari> O_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
<Lambda> Where are the others?
<Lambda> I only know of yours, Evan's, the one by the TV, and the work one
<Lambda> that makes 5
<RedDragonX> LIVE ON ELECTRIC SHEEP
<Neon> MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY
<Neon> GRAVE DIGGER
<Stormy> One family desktop, my mom and dad's desktop, my two laptops, Evan's laptop, my mom's laptop, my dad's laptop, and my mom's two ancient laptops that never get used
<Stormy> So 9
<prince-dari> he grabed wepon
<RedDragonX> I have five, my sisters each have one, my dad has one, and my mom has three
<Lambda> I have one
<Lambda> my mom and sister share one
<Lambda> and one desktop
<prince-dari> Oh wait, there's actually 5 in the house.
<Lambda> if my dad counts we have four
<Lambda> but he's only home on weekends
<Stormy> Jenna is the only one who doesn't have a laptop
<Stormy> So the desktop is basically hers now
<Stormy> No one else uses it
<prince-dari> I can't remember why, but there's something I dislike about laptops.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, the screens aren't big enough.
<RedDragonX> 17 inchers are not bad
<Stormy> yeah, that's like mine
<RedDragonX> my Asus is 17.3
<Lambda> If I would have known that I didn't NEED a laptop for college like they say I'd have gotten a desktop instead
<RedDragonX> largest one I could find
<Stormy> It's weird going from using the netbook for a while back to using this one
<Stormy> "this screen is tiny" "this screen is huge"
<prince-dari> Compared to 30" they are.
<Stormy> Why would you need a 30" monitor?
<Stormy> that's bigger than most TVs
<Lambda> [21:41] <~Stormy> Why would you need a 30" monitor?
<Lambda> PONIES
<prince-dari> Oh, it's only 27".
<Stormy> Haha
<Stormy> Well still
<prince-dari> So I can fit lots of stuff on it.
<Stormy> 17.3 is big enough for me
<Stormy> two windows at once is all I need
<prince-dari> You should see my desktop when I have lots of stuff open.
<Stormy> any more than that and I start to get overwhelmed anyway
<Stormy> I can barely have two conversations at once on MSN
<prince-dari> As it is I have about 40 tabs and 10 things open.
<Lambda> O.O
<prince-dari> And that's after all my stuff got shut down when the computer blue screened.
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Stormy> One person will end up getting ignored while I talk to the other
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> True.
<RedDragonX> Yay
<RedDragonX> time for a new NC
<prince-dari> NC?
<RedDragonX> Nostalgia Critic
<Lambda> a new North Carolina?
<prince-dari> Oh.

<RedDragonX> this is a pretty funny video
<Stormy> I paused it to watch a game trailer
<Stormy> :P
<Stormy> Unfortunately I can't understand a word of it because it's all Japanese
<Neon> So... many... trailers... due to E3...
<Stormy> I'm seriously considering getting a PS3 now
<Stormy> thanks to E3
<RedDragonX> I should have waited to get one
<Stormy> this is the first time I've ever seen it
<RedDragonX> they have wireless internet in them now
<RedDragonX> my older model doesn't
<Lambda> I want to get one too
<prince-dari> PS3 got some good exclusives? I'm surprised.
<Stormy> They didn't always?
<Stormy> RedDragonX, is yours backwards compatible?
<Neon> It was always about the exclusives!
<Neon> inFamous, Resistance, etc.
<prince-dari> Other than GT5 what?
<Stormy> because I will get a new one and trade you if it is
<Lambda> dari: more Uncharted stuff, and the stuff Neon just said
<RedDragonX> no it isn't
<Stormy> oh
<Stormy> damn
<RedDragonX> I have my old PS2
<RedDragonX> I still use that
<Neon> My PS3 is backwards compatible. >:P
<RedDragonX> the new models might be
<Lambda> We'll trade you!
<Neon> How else can I play my darling Spyro?
<RedDragonX> mine isn't though
<Lambda> RDX: only the old models are
<Lambda> the very old ones
<Neon> The new models are no longer BC. Only the 60 gig PS3 was, years ago.
<Lambda> which is why they're so rare
<RedDragonX> oh well
<RedDragonX> I still have my PS2
<RedDragonX> that's good enough for me
<Stormy> I think 20, 40, and 60 GB ones were
<RedDragonX> well then mine might be
<Stormy> After that they stopped making them backwards compatible with PS2
<RedDragonX> but I only use it for PS3 games and Blueray
<Neon> Oh, the first ones, yeah.
<Stormy> But they're still backwards compatible with PS1
<Stormy> =/
<Neon> Even then, they weren't BC with /every/ title.
<Lambda> so it was like the 360
<Stormy> really?
<Stormy> I never heard that
<Lambda> me neither
<Stormy> thought that was only the 360 that did that
<RedDragonX> I can play any playstation game so I'm good
<prince-dari> Same.
<prince-dari> Got my PS2.
<Neon> About 95%, but a few of my games happened to not work.
<RedDragonX> http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/747-rejuvenated-sony-shows-off-games-lineup-prices-ps-vita-under-250Stormy:
<Stormy> I still have a PSX and PS2
<Stormy> But I'd rather just have one console
<Neon> Evidently I had some obscure titles.
<RedDragonX> oops
<Stormy> I don't think it mattered which title it was
<RedDragonX> http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/747-rejuvenated-sony-shows-off-games-lineup-prices-ps-vita-under-250
<Stormy> It had the actual PS2 hardware
<Stormy> So I don't think it could have been selective about which games it could play
<Neon> Not all of them did. They used an adapter after the first year.
<Stormy> Oh, yeah, I'm talking about the first ones
<Neon> I guess PS2 hardware wasn't worth the cost to them.
<Stormy> I still never heard of that adapter though
<Neon> Also, the PS2 didn't play every PS game.
<Lambda> seriously?
<Lambda> this is all new to me
<Stormy> Me too
<Neon> I'm almost sure of that.
<Stormy> Got any sources?
<Neon> Let me confirm that.
<Lambda> I always thought the 360 was the only console that was ever selectively backwards compatible
<Stormy> Not really interested in the Vita
<Lambda> me neither
<Stormy> PSP never interested me either
<prince-dari> What's the vita?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Stormy> the new Playstation handheld
<prince-dari> "Undaunted by its recent rough ride at the hands of hackers"
<Stormy> Oh please
<prince-dari> They were the ones who had the rough ride?
<Stormy> don't try to tell us it "wasn't anonymous" again
<prince-dari> "SUESUESUESUESUESUESUESUE"
<Lambda> it looks exactly like the PSP, but with a touchscreen and some social networking feature
<Stormy> and from what I heard they had a perfectly legitimate reason to sue
<Lambda> the Vita I mean
<Stormy> Yeah, social networking thing is meh
<Stormy> If it
<Stormy> *it's optional, I'll ignore it
<Stormy> but it'll still be annoying that it's there
<Stormy> If it's not optional... even less interested
<Neon> I hate to cite wikipedia, but I'm lazy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_incompatible_with_PlayStation_2
<prince-dari> They had no reason to sue. They sued some harmless homebrew developers. They sued all of Team Fail0verflow for hacking the console when they didn't even release their hacks.
<Stormy> I thought someone got a hold of something they weren't supposed to have had
<prince-dari> They own the console.
<Stormy> A developer secret or something
<prince-dari> They can do whatever the hell they want with it.
<Stormy> That's what I heard
<Neon> No, it was all an issue of what was considered "tampering" with the console.
<Neon> They owned the console, as Dari says, so they should have free reign.
<prince-dari> They never agreed no to.
<prince-dari> not*
<Lambda> I heard that the hackers had gotten all sorts of personal information from other Sony users
<prince-dari> ...
<Lambda> as well as money
<Neon> In fact, there was a clause originally that actually said they could do whatever they wanted.
<Stormy> Yeah, and that too
<prince-dari> No money.
<Stormy> which is why Sony had to shut it down
<Neon> But Sony withdrew it at some point afterward.
<Stormy> To protect their customers' identities
<prince-dari> Someone hacked PSN, and stole all the details (probably not credit card details).
<prince-dari> No one know who did it.
<prince-dari> It wasn't any of the people who made homebrew I'd say almost for sure.
<Neon> LulzSec claims responsibility.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, they released all the information didn't they?
<Lambda> it's like a witch hunt if you ask me
<prince-dari> I think I saw it on their site.
<Lambda> but either way I don't see what sony did wrong honestly
<Neon> Ostensibly, yeah.
<Stormy> I'm sure I read an article that explained that what the hackers did was illegal
<prince-dari> It wasn't.
<Lambda> I don't see why it's them who're the bad guys, and not the hackers
<prince-dari> Sony did something illegal.
<Stormy> Unfortunately I found that link from Spyroforum
<prince-dari> They removed otherOS.
<Neon> Sony's mistake was having such a weak security of its 70 million+ users who put their personal info in Sony's hands.
<Stormy> So I can't get to it now
<prince-dari> An advertised feature.
<prince-dari> They got sued in several places for that.
<prince-dari> Then they sued hackers for doing stuff with consoles THEY owned?
<prince-dari> That's not right.
<Neon> Whoever was the culprit of the "hacking" should be thanked, given nothing has been stolen.
<Lambda> Microsoft does it all the time
<Lambda> they brick modded consoles
<Lambda> nobody complains about them
<prince-dari> This wasn't a modded console.
<Stormy> ...that's what you just said
<prince-dari> They weren't using hacks online.
<prince-dari> They hadn't entered into any agreements.
<prince-dari> If you agree with Microsoft's terms to use Xbox live you probably agree to having your console bricked if you mod it.
<prince-dari> When geohot released CFW he even disabled something to stop piracy.
<prince-dari> (some people worked out how to do it anyway, but that was pretty late, so other CFWs that allowed piracy came into existence soon after)
<prince-dari> Sony didn't sue any of the people who made backup managers that allowed piracy.
<Stormy> So they sued the wrong people
<prince-dari> Sony made youtube and several other people give up all the IP addresses of people who had even viewed certain pages/videos.
<Stormy> ....
<Neon> Well, it was more like they sued the people who stole candy bars instead of those who stole museum art.
<Lambda> I never heard that
<Stormy> pretty sure they can't do that
<Stormy> No one can do that
<prince-dari> They did.
<Stormy> Why would youtube agree to do that
<Stormy> that makes no sense
<prince-dari> A judge said they had to.
<prince-dari> [04:18] <Stormy> So they sued the wrong people You make it sound like that's not a big deal, how would you like a MASSIVE coroporation slapping a lawsuit on you?
<prince-dari> One person.
<Stormy> Uh, no, I was just saying that hoping for clarification
<Stormy> making sure I got it right
<Lambda> Dari, do you have any news articles or anything confirming all of this?
<prince-dari> Oh, google had to hand over IP address too.
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Lambda> I'm finding pleanty about Sony mishandling the situation out of incompetance
<Lambda> but nothing about them abusing anyone's rights
<Neon> Google = YouTube, so no need to specify that.
<Neon> The right of the consumers is what is being breached, not necessarily citizen's liberties.
<prince-dari> This is the one about Sony getting the IP addresses of anyone who even visited geohot's site.
<prince-dari> Let me find the one about google/youtube.
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (TR_Reed10) 11WB10»11•. 10- * TR_Reed wants a pony
<prince-dari> I think one of Sony's PR people who'd been with them 10+ years quit over what Sony'd done because they pretty much ruined his job.
<Lambda> I read the Wired article that the article of yours links to
<Lambda> and it sounds like yes, Sony took it a bit too far
<Lambda> but
<Lambda> they sued and did everything to not allow piracy
<Lambda> "Jailbreaking a console is also a prerequisite to running pirated copies of games, which Sony emphasizes in its lawsuit."
<prince-dari> They sued people who had nothing to do with piracy.
<Neon> But piracy is an assumption.
<Lambda> they sued one guy who made the hack
<Lambda> and showed others how to do the same
<prince-dari> Team Fail0verflow didn't even release any of their work and they got sued, I'm fairly sure.
<Stormy> the guy released a jailbreak
<Neon> There's no evidence of that among those who were sued.
<Stormy> jailbreak is needed for piracy
<prince-dari> He released a jailbreak for iPods.
<prince-dari> That's legal.
<Stormy> they want to get rid of the jailbreak so there won't be piracy
<Lambda> "and now the PlayStation 3 jailbreak"
<Stormy> Makes sense to me
<Neon> Buying a gun is a "prerequisite" for robbing a bank, but does that mean everyone who buys that gun or knows how to get one will rob a bank?
<prince-dari> Nice analogy Neon.
<Stormy> No, but what else do you use a jailbreak for?
<Lambda> I'm not familiar with a jailbreak
<Stormy> I honestly don't know
<prince-dari> Homebrew Stormy.
<Lambda> what else does it do?
<prince-dari> What else?
<prince-dari> That's the whole point of it.
<Neon> Personal experimentation. There are far more legal applications of a jailbroken console.
<prince-dari> Having the ability to do WHATEVER you want on your own console.
<Stormy> Minus pirating
<prince-dari> Well, as long as it's legal.
<Stormy> Which people were apparently doing because of this
<Stormy> So of course they're going to want to take it down
<Neon> But anyone can take any instructional video and do something illegal with it.
<Stormy> I'm not saying they handled it the right way
<Neon> That's hardly the fault of the defendants.
<Stormy> It is his fault for putting it out there, is probably how they saw it
<Stormy> if it wasn't there, people couldn't do that
<Neon> No, it's not. It's beyond his control what people decide to do with the information.
<Lambda> you're pluralizing defendents
<Neon> He never suggested piracy.
<Lambda> who else got sued by Sony?
<Stormy> Neon, I'm saying that's how they saw it
<prince-dari> What about Team Fail0verflow? They never released anything.
<Stormy> Not how it is
<prince-dari> Still got sued.
<Neon> Yeah, I understand, Stormy.
<Stormy> and prince-dari, I don't know who that is
<Neon> But it's a shortsighted view, and everyone should be clear on that.
<prince-dari> The first group of people who hacked the PS3.
<Lambda> and what did they do when they hacked it?
<prince-dari> Nothing.
<prince-dari> Fairly sure geohot released the information.
<prince-dari> They still all got sued.
<Lambda> what do you mean?
<Lambda> how can you hack and do nothing?
<Lambda> there had to have been something
<Chimera> 04http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/060/1/5/silver_used_lick__free_icon__by_anonislove-d3aokic.gif <-- DID NOT EXPECT.
<Neon> Modifying a console is not wrong. Modifying it for illicit purposes is.
<Stormy> OK, I think I've got it now
<Neon> That's as condensed as I can make it.
<Stormy> They shouldn't have sued
<Stormy> But I still see where there were coming from
<Stormy> Since people were using that tool to do something illegal
<Lambda> honestly
<Lambda> I know a few people with homebrew for their DS
<Lambda> they all use it for pirated games
<prince-dari> Wii got hacked, Nintendo didn't sue.
<Lambda> not my point
<Stormy> Yes, I get it
<Stormy> Sony shouldn't have sued
<Stormy> I said that already
<Stormy> Sheesh
<RedDragonX> Blarg?
<Lambda> I just don't see sony as the ultimate evil here
<Neon> Well, piracy should be the ultimate evil.
<Neon> But seeing as Sony is making such a huge mistake you can't just ignore that.
<Stormy> we're not ignoring it
<prince-dari> To be honest I laughed hard when I found out that PSN had been hacked, even though that was my information stolen.
<Stormy> I was just uninformed of what happened before this discussion
<RedDragonX> well have fun
<Stormy> I thought I had the complete story from the article I read
<RedDragonX> g'night folks
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Lambda> night RDX
<Stormy> Night
<Lambda> same here
<Lambda> I heard both sides of the story
<Lambda> neither really in depth
<Lambda> and I beleived the side in Sony's defense a bit more
<Lambda> it still makes sense to me
<Lambda> I just agree that sony took it too far
<prince-dari> Homebrew is awesome anyway. HD shaders on the Atari, SNES, and even a NDS emulator soon to be released.
<Lambda> I still agree with their reasoning though
<Neon> Amen. I have school in the morning.
<Neon> Good night.
<prince-dari> Alright, cya Neon.

<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04I looked outside and I was like "Wait...shit, it's morning."
<Armageddon> I have too
<Armageddon> but that was in year 8

<Drake> 04LOLWUT
<Drake> 04No wonder you fucked it up
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> I don't think I fucked it that badly
<Armageddon> but
<Armageddon> I didn't know the answers to some questions
<Armageddon> and such
<Armageddon> and I stared at the first question
<Armageddon> for like
<Armageddon> 2 minutes
<Armageddon> and then was like "OH"
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> I know
<Armageddon> I failed
<Armageddon> also btw
<Armageddon> what did you get
<Drake> 04It's a comp
<Drake> 04who cares
<Armageddon> for the second last question?
<Drake> 04Uh
<Drake> 04which one was that?
<Armageddon> the one about the SANP circuit shits
<Armageddon> with A=1, B=1, B=0, etc. etc.
<Drake> 04Oh
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04I did A=1, B=1
<Armageddon> I think I got it wrong ;;
<Armageddon> same
<Drake> 04I'm pretty sure that was right
<Armageddon> but all my friends put A=0, B=1
<Armageddon> or whatever, the other way round
<Armageddon> so yeah
<Drake> 04Because then it's equal 0 which would equal 1 which would equal 0 or w/e
<Armageddon> oh well
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04It's was confusing.
<Armageddon> ;p
<Armageddon> I was trying to keep my eyes open through the test
<Armageddon> ;x
<Drake> 04I was trying not to let my mind wander.
<Drake> 04ffs my story is finally progressing.
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> what story?
<Armageddon> life story?
<Drake> 04lolno
<Drake> 04Fanfic
<Armageddon> oh
<Armageddon> okay
<Armageddon> I sometimes work on Reminiscence
<Armageddon> I feel like doing TCTL though
<Armageddon> been playing yugioh recently though, so I haven't been on my computer as much ;x
<Drake> 04Yugioh? The cards or the games?
<Armageddon> games
<Drake> 04Ah
<Armageddon> Yu-gi-oh 2011 World Championship
<Drake> 04I have Yugioh Worldwide Edition. Fun as hell.
<Armageddon> I got Stardust Dragon, Red Dragon Archfiend, Shooting Star Dragon and Red Nova Dragon from Sazera
<Armageddon> Sazerac*
<Armageddon> As she finished the game
<Drake> 04oh
<Armageddon> Red Nova Dragon is my favourite card <3
<Drake> 04cool
<Drake> 04You like dragons
<Armageddon> I run a dragon deck
<Drake> 04/end
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> my deck is actually pretty decent
<Armageddon> sometimes
<Armageddon> but Saz is like
<Armageddon> the best deck maker ever
<Armageddon> she has a deck where she can summon shooting star dragon on her first turn ;x
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04But
<Drake> 04Don't you need to shuffle your deck>
<Drake> 04So isn't it random>
<Armageddon> yes
<Drake> 04?*
<Drake> 04fff
<Armageddon> it's random
<Armageddon> but she can still summon it on her first turnn
<Armageddon> all she needs is foolish burial and that other card, forgot its name
<Armageddon> that speed spell which allows you to special summon a level one monster
<Armageddon> oh wait
<Armageddon> no
<Armageddon> not that one
<Armageddon> it was some random combo
<Armageddon> it needed foolish burial and dandelion to be in the deck
<Armageddon> then you foolish burial'd dandelion which summoned 2 fluff tokens to the field
<Armageddon> and then yeah
<Armageddon> and shooting star dragon
<Armageddon> is so fucking hard to kill it's not even funny
<Armageddon> I can kill it with red nova or FGD but they're hard to get out
<Armageddon> and my deck isn't a fusion dragon deck unlike my world championship 2006 one

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> Hey aggelos_the_dragon
<aggelos_the_dragon> hi
<aggelos_the_dragon> i didnt regognize you with that name
<DSD> Heh
<DSD> I'm DSD DSD=DArk Shadow Dragon
<aggelos_the_dragon> i read that the new game of spyro is going to be just like the old ones for ps1
<aggelos_the_dragon> yeah
<DSD> It really does look that way.
<aggelos_the_dragon> i think that spyro is a bit ugly
<aggelos_the_dragon> i like the old spyro who was nice and sweet
<prince-dari> Spyro doesn't talk in this new game, he looks fugly, and the storyline looks set to be nothing like the old games.
<aggelos_the_dragon> hi dari
<aggelos_the_dragon> :(
<aggelos_the_dragon> lol
<prince-dari> Hey.
<aggelos_the_dragon> he doesnt talkkkkkkkk
<aggelos_the_dragon> i dont like it already
<DSD> Well we don't really now
<aggelos_the_dragon> i feel like spyro doesnt excist anymore
<DSD> It still has yet to come out
<UxieLover1994> 13Hi!
<aggelos_the_dragon> hi
<DSD> Also The story being the same old one will get old real fast
<DSD> 4Besides theres a water dragon
<UxieLover1994> 13What you oui mean?
<prince-dari> In this one he just seems like a dumb animal that runs around killing stuff and collecting stuff for no reason.
<UxieLover1994> 13No trashing SSA, Dari!
<DSD> 4http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Zap
<DSD> 4A Water Dragon thats playable
<DSD> 4And maybe many more
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!
<prince-dari> It looks fugly too.
<prince-dari> Why would I want to play as another character anyway?
<DSD> 4I would man
<bed> 03gcg
<DSD> 4Now i can play with friends i beat the crap out of Spyro or play as a team
<UxieLover1994> 13So, duu!
<aggelos_the_dragon> call me crazy but i think spyro is alive and he is in heaven lol
<aggelos_the_dragon> uxie for the first time dari is right.they make spyro ugly and just like the 32 other characters.spyro sopposed to be special do you agree?
<UxieLover1994> 13Crid ib!
<aggelos_the_dragon> what crid ib means?
<UxieLover1994> 13It's in Al Bhed
<UxieLover1994> 13Learn by playing FFX or FFX-2, unless you think they are ugly!
<aggelos_the_dragon> anyway witch spyro do you like the new one or the old one?
<prince-dari> I don't play/like FF games.
<UxieLover1994> 13Unsure
<aggelos_the_dragon> how can you be unsure?
<UxieLover1994> 13E tuhd ghof
<DSD> 4I like the Water dragon Zap
<DSD> 4They need online
<prince-dari> ...Online? In Spyro?
<UxieLover1994> 13Yep
<prince-dari> >__>
<UxieLover1994> 13Not that oui care!
<prince-dari> Well that isn't the worst idea I've heard today.
<prince-dari> Oh wait, it is.
<prince-dari> :P
<aggelos_the_dragon> you need internet to play the game?
<aggelos_the_dragon> :s
<DSD> 4No
<DSD> 4I'm saying they should add it so you can play wordwide
<aggelos_the_dragon> it going to be like world of warcraft?
<UxieLover1994> 13What would you rather see, Dari: Meteors killing us all, or the new Spyro game?
<prince-dari> Meteors could be fun, you never know.
<UxieLover1994> 13Heartless
<aggelos_the_dragon> :) looooool
<DSD> 4-Not sure
<DSD> 4I think how it will be is
<DSD> 4You get your game amd stuff
<DSD> 4But if you want you can play online in pvp or story mode or random levels
<prince-dari> PvP? In Spyro...Oh my God this game is even worse than I thought.
<aggelos_the_dragon> do you believe that spyro is alive and that it lives. i believe it.am i crazy?
<UxieLover1994> 13Spyro is not dead, as proven over and over again!
<prince-dari> I wish they would just let it die. They've ground his name into the dirt. :P
<prince-dari> With so many horrible reruns.
<UxieLover1994> 13Did not!
<DSD> 4PvP would be fun
<DSD> 4Pawning the S*** out of noobs
<DSD> 4getting pawned
<DSD> 4Playing with friends
<DSD> 4Co-op levels
<aggelos_the_dragon> i feel that spyro is my friend.because when i was a kid no one has given me attention.so i was playing spyro in ps1
<DSD> 4I can now play with friends
<UxieLover1994> 13Hey, DSD, what would you like to see in a fan-made cartoon of the series?
<DSD> 4Aw
<DSD> 4Well try this
<DSD> 4See?
<DSD> 4Watching sure
<DSD> 4Being a part of sure
<DSD> 4Being a cartoon is another story
<UxieLover1994> 13True
<UxieLover1994> 13But a cartoon of the classic series could calm the fans who hate the new game
<UxieLover1994> 13Though it shoud take place after Shadow Legacy
<aggelos_the_dragon> i'd love to see a cartoon of spyro.but i want him to be created by charles zembillas
<aggelos_the_dragon> there are not a lot of fans of spyro because they didnt have the chance to met him by the original games
<aggelos_the_dragon> what do you think?
<UxieLover1994> 13True
<UxieLover1994> 13It would be good
<aggelos_the_dragon> why did insomniac sell spyro?
<UxieLover1994> 13They ran out of ideas
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i have plentyyyy of ideas
<UxieLover1994> 13Same here
<UxieLover1994> 13I can imagin Spyro going back in time, enter a computer sistom (parody of Tron) even helping some old allies when Ripto or Gnasty Gnorc started to become threats again
<Skylands> 10!espeon !sneas !umbreon
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 8 minutes
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 60 minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to Skylands for 5 minutes
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6nice
<UxieLover1994> 13I just wish I worked for Insomiac at the time...
<UxieLover1994> 13But still, Ratchet & Clank is just as awsome!
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6ey i just wrote that
<UxieLover1994> 13Opps, cunno!
<prince-dari> [15:38] <aggelos_the_dragon> why did insomniac sell spyro? They never owned the intellectual property to him.
<prince-dari> They didn't have a choice to make more games (not that I think they would have).
<UxieLover1994> 13They created that series, Dari!
<prince-dari> I know, but they didn't own the idea.
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i wanna work for insomniac but that will never happens because i live in greece
<UxieLover1994> 13Then WHO did!?
<UxieLover1994> 13I cannot ether. I live in Australia
<prince-dari> Saw it somewhere on an insomniac forum, I'll try and find it for you.
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6you have more chances to work to insomniac
<prince-dari> UxieLover1994: see this http://www.insomniacgames.com/community/index.php?topic=40603.0;wap2
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!
<prince-dari> "Right now Sierra owns Spyro. Sierra chooses developers to work with the Spyro IP. Even though Insomniac created the Spyro IP they don't have ownership to it."
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6then why they say that spyro is insomniacs maskot?
<UxieLover1994> 13I know! Do you HATE ME, Dari!?
<prince-dari> Ratchet and Clank are more insomniac's mascot, and they still don't own them.
<prince-dari> Why would I hate you?
<DSD> 4I live in teh US
<UxieLover1994> 13Because we think differently
<DSD> 4I want to work for the curret holder of spyro
<prince-dari> I don't have any problems with your opinion, I just wish you wouldn't take the fact that mine differs from your so badly.
<UxieLover1994> 13When why are we always fighting?
<DSD> 4If i worked for them i would make a comic for a few things
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6not again
<DSD> 4Maybe tie in a few things
<DSD> 4And make a plot
<DSD> 4about the reboots
<DSD> 4And the new ones
<DSD> 4as one
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i now know one thing
<DSD> 4?
<UxieLover1994> 13DSD, I must let you know I'm comming down with something, so I cannot speak and type propperly
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6we will never see the real spyro again
<DSD> 4Whatcha coming down with??
<UxieLover1994> 13I've got a sore througt, so I might be coming down with a cold
<DSD> 4aw
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6im sad
<DSD> 4?
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6:(
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6for spyro
<DSD> 4Whats wrong?
<UxieLover1994> 13I've lost my voice
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6call me crazy but i think that spyro is in heaven
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6and we will find him when we die
<UxieLover1994> 13Guess that explains why I was not as chearful on KHII, and I'm usally very happy in Space Paranoids...
<UxieLover1994> 13Spyro is NOT dead!
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6im talking about the real life
<DSD> 4My god it's a cult of spyro
*DSD 4jumps in a window
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6lol
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6is this bad?
<DSD> 4Yes
*DSD 4pulls out his guns
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6what do you mean with all this stuff
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6?
<DSD> 4Well first
<DSD> 4you think Spyro is heaven
<DSD> 4Cult
<DSD> 4ou think whe ou die ou wil go there
<DSD> 4CUT
<DSD> 4*cult
<DSD> 4When you think Spyro is a god
<DSD> 4Cult
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i think that spyro is (in) heaven n
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6not that spyro is a god
<DSD> 4>.>
<DSD> 4He died?
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6for gods sake shut up
<DSD> 4You first
<UxieLover1994> 13Didn't you guts see the last scene in DotD?
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6oh
<DSD> 4I did
<DSD> 4I watched Youtube
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6theres anyone who can understand me?
<DSD> 4Not really
<DSD> 4The way i see it is Spyro gets ready for a fight with the Sorcerer but loses
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6thats ok you are not the only one
<DSD> 4He is then trapped and another him in a whole another world is made
<DSD> 4This one happens to latter meet Cynder
<DSD> 4After that another one is made
<DSD> 4For Skylanders
<DSD> 4This one has 31 friends
<DSD> 4See theres going to be a army
<DSD> 4Spyro will need his others help
<DSD> 4And there friends
<DSD> 4For a battle with Evil
<DSD> 4And all the evil will come back
<DSD> 4For a big battle
<UxieLover1994> 13I think I need to undergo surgery. I can taste blood
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6you just made a plot
<DSD> 4O.O
<DSD> 4Yes i did
<DSD> 4Uxie docter now
<DSD> 4Now Uxie don't say no
<DSD> 4See my plot would be cool
<DSD> 4It would tie in everything
<UxieLover1994> 13I would, but no doctor is avalable, becuase it's late. Besides, my fokes won't beleave me
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i made my first plot when i was 3 years old lol
<DSD> 4Uxie what kind of place is it?
<DSD> 4We have them all the time
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6what time is in australia right now?
<DSD> 4Plus we have 911
<UxieLover1994> 13 12:30am
<DSD> 4And phones for nine one one
<DSD> 4Heck we have them all the time
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6here is 18:08
<DSD> 4So Aggelos do you like my plot?
<DSD> 4It's 9:09 am here
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6yeah
<DSD> 4My plot would bring back the three spyros
<DSD> 4And his friends
<UxieLover1994> 13A doctor can only be contacted during daylight hours unless it's serious. And I love the pilot
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6but this plot is for TLoS
<DSD> 4Uxie i swear if you die i'ma going to ban your account
<DSD> 4No it's for all
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6it doesnt look like an original spyro plot
<UxieLover1994> 13I can never convince my family to take me to a doctor, since they think of it as a regular cold
<DSD> 4See the last game in the first Spyro
<DSD> 4Second he ends up with Cynder
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6of coursw
<DSD> 4Third he is a hero of many lands
<UxieLover1994> 13It's not deadly. I'll be alright
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6course
<DSD> 4So a comic should have the second and third finding out about this
<DSD> 4And then meeting each other
<DSD> 4And then a game should happen
<DSD> 4You know bring back evryone for one last fight
<DSD> 4Then you can let it go from there
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6yeah its nice
<aggelos_the_dragon> 6i want bentley and sgt. bird

<prince-dari> Lol, most of the fans are 18-34.
<Charizard> thats a shame
<Charizard> ill be a fan of pokemon not mlp
<May> 14lol that's why people collect them
<prince-dari> Someone posted a good CS Lewis quote recently, let me find it.
<May> 14like they do with beanie babies
<prince-dari> "Critics who treat adult as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."
<prince-dari> CS Lewis was a pro. :P
<Charizard> sounds like somewhat a cop out to me
<Charizard> no one should care what you do
*eXAKR reads that and gets inspiration
<Charizard> but im not going to be out there HEY I LOVE POKEMOn
<Charizard> LOOK AT ME
<eXAKR> Maybe I should be less embarassed about myself still liking a few things from my childhood
<May> 14There's a stamp I like, it says "Cartoons. Consider this, ADULTS make 'em."
<eXAKR> Not just Pokémon
<May> 14I love that stamp
<aggelos_the_dragon> anyone?
*eXAKR coughThomasTheTankEnginecoughcoughcough
<Charizard> but its like saying gay pride
<May> 14uhm
<Charizard> what do you have to be proud of
<May> 14Not really
<Charizard> then your missing the point
<May> 14I go around saying I like Pokemon all the time
<Charizard> to strangers?
<May> 14People don't care, a lot of times people agree with me
<May> 14Yeah
<May> 14to strangers
<Charizard> so you randomly say it
<May> 14No
<Charizard> ok then
<May> 14when they mention it, I say I love them
<Charizard> that makes sense
<May> 14Besides, why would they mention Pokemon in the first place if they didn't have some kind of experience with them? :>
<prince-dari> Charizard: I think the gay pride is just about not being ashamed of who you are.
<Charizard> that applies to what cs lewis said
<Charizard> is what im saying
<Charizard> its radically different
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4hey
<Charizard> god its so hot around here
<May> 14I have to go out soon and work for the day
<May> 14I go to move some sheep to the neighbors so they can go graze in the pasture

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4And so More Spyro's are made
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4And so they free them selfs
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4And then they go help him
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4My best plot ever
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4They should make a game based of this
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4With all three Spyros
<aggelos_the_dragon> yes but were are the portals?
*Cynder7 6is slightly confused.

<NewDCD> weren't we going to have the selection live, though?
<Hipster_Brony> 8right
<Hipster_Brony> 8but
<Hipster_Brony> 8we still need to have people enter, and it's easier for me if we do it as a selection thread
<NewDCD> ah
<NewDCD> I see
<Hipster_Brony> 8we'll just say you have to be present to win
<NewDCD> have the OFFICIAL ENTRIES in the thread
<NewDCD> I see
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> Will I be streaming the ballot?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ballot?
<NewDCD> whatever you use for the random selection
<NewDCD> since it's gotta be streamed live and all
<Hipster_Brony> 8i just put them in a list organizer and randomize it, there's not really anything to watch
<Hipster_Brony> 8plus, if we did it that way, it would show all the winners at once, and that houldn't be very dramatic
<NewDCD> there's a way to work through that
<Hipster_Brony> 8it shouldn't take nearly as long as the normal one with people all in chat
<NewDCD> and I thought we were doing it that way to prevent accusations of foul play?
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> what program do you use?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.random.org/lists/
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was just going to screencap it if it became an issue, i don't think anyone seriously thinks its corrupt except maybe turnibrony
<NewDCD> See what I' doing?
<NewDCD> *I'm
<NewDCD> it could make
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah ok
<NewDCD> for an exciting game
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, here's what we can do
<NewDCD> okay
<NewDCD> this seems like the best way
<NewDCD> see what I'm doing?
<NewDCD> just zooming in seems to work wonders
<NewDCD> just gotta set up a borderline
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'll keep an eye on the selection thread and add names to a word file, then email it to you as an attachment when the movie is over
<Hipster_Brony> 8looks good to me
<NewDCD> there
<NewDCD> makes for an exciting method
<NewDCD> for the viewers, I mean
<NewDCD> since they don't know who might win
<NewDCD> might actually help increase viewership a bit
<NewDCD> considering it also becomes a "game"
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah

<Hipster_Brony> 8i have never even heard of these games before
<NewDCD> it's weird you have never heard of the Ace Attorney series
<NewDCD> it really is quite popular
<NewDCD> you might have heard of it as "Phoenix Wright"
<Hipster_Brony> 8*shrug* im not much of a gamer
<NewDCD> not to mention a lot of posts in Ponychan are related to this
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had never heard of phoenix wright until i posted on Ponychan

<Hipster_Brony> 8fucking soulja boy
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, shouldn't they be interrogating this guy at the police station or something?
<NewDCD> Ace Attorney is definitely not realistic, but lots of fun
<NewDCD> also, not a "suspect", since Portsman IS the prosecutor in charge of THIS investigation
<Hipster_Brony> 8and now comes the fun part, waiting 2-3 months for the lab work on the blood sample

<May> 14<Shadow_Lugia> I saw a deer yesterday. ovo <-- Yes deers are quite rare in the Pokemon world. You sure it wasn't a Deerling or Sawsbuck instead?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And Nick, how do you have 0.01 of a landmine?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I was making a pseudo-reference to Portal 2. :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6As well as it being true.
<Nick> it's small
*Cynder7 6backs away slowly
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I see.

<Nick> o-o
<Nick> how'd you avoid all my AA batteries? D:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I flew. :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And plus, I know nothing about whatever machinery you laid out.
<Nick> I emphasize 'AA' batteries (anti aircraft)
<Shadow_Lugia> 6AA batteries? :P
<Nick> meaning groups of static weapons
<Shadow_Lugia> 6As you can see, clueless.

<Mikey> red shoryu
<Mikey> even though I hate kacheeks yay I got a kacheek av
*Cynder7 6has a bad feeling about the object that's to be hunted.
<prince-dari> Why do you want a PS3 so much?
<pallaskitten> what will be streamed?
<Cynder7> 6Generally cause I just do and..Idk..graphics,be able to get new games seeing as nothing new gets made for PS2..Guess that mainly..
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to get the order real quick.
<SirSprinkles> 6I forgot the order. Xd
<SirSprinkles> 6*XD
<Cynder7> 6Ok..these reasons just sound pretty lame but anyway..
<prince-dari> Haven't turned my PS3 on in over a month, haha.
<prince-dari> I'll probably buy Skyrim when it comes out though.
<SirSprinkles> 6Party of One, Super Mario Bros Movie, Young Frankenstein, Over a Barrel
<Icydragon> 12I need more ps3 games...
<Cynder7> 6Skyrim?
<Cynder7> 6I need to try out new games..All these years I've just been stuck on Spyro and Sims.. .-.
<prince-dari> The newest "The Elder Scrolls" game.
<Cynder7> 6Aah
<prince-dari> With dragons. :)
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8ypu
<prince-dari> Although you kill them.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yup*
<prince-dari> But meh, still dragons.
<Cynder7> 6xD Nice :P
<Icydragon> 12I no wanna kill dragons D:
<Cynder7> 6Yet you kill puppys?
<prince-dari> I think maybe not all of them try to kill you, they hinted that.
<Icydragon> 12I kill puppies no more
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cynder7> 6How come dear Icy?
<prince-dari> I wonder if they'll release a MLP game
<prince-dari> That'd make consoles 20% cooler.
<prince-dari> And I'd get that game in 10 seconds flat.
<Cynder7> 6I had forgotten about that music! D:
<Cynder7> 6Btw,what's MLP? >.<
<prince-dari> My Little Pony.
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Icydragon> 12Dari, do you think Marvel vs Capcom 3 is a good game?
<Cynder7> 6I wonder what you could possibly do in such a game.. o.o
<prince-dari> Never played it Icy.
<suicune> o.o
<Icydragon> 12I think it's boring, I might sell it
<prince-dari> Cynder7: I wouldn't give a damn if it has (G4) ponies, I want it.
<Icydragon> 12G4?
<prince-dari> That's the current cartoon ponies.
<prince-dari> On the Hub.
<prince-dari> The previous ones are...Eugh...Creepy.
<Icydragon> 12Is hub owned by hasbro? I think so
<Cynder7> 6xD
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Rukodiora> o.o
<Cynder7> 6Aah,the joy..
<Rukodiora> 8,11C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
<Icydragon> 12Makes sense seeing as all there toy inspired shows are there
<Cynder7> 6Getting a pony,making it pink and shiny and just skipping around happily on a fluffy cloud..
<Icydragon> 12Cynder7: That happens every time I take LSD
<Cynder7> 6xD
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Icydragon> 12Been a while since I smoked... god it's painful
<Icydragon> 12Drugs are bad kiddies
*Cynder7 6would ask for suggestions but doesn't want to get her hopes up.. ._.
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly had forgotten which episode was playing first, and which was playing last. XD
<prince-dari> Suggestions for what?
<Cynder7> 6Games..
<prince-dari> Well everyone seems to rave about the Uncharted games, I haven't played them though.
<Icydragon> 12GET BLACK OPS YO!IT'S COOL CUZ U SHOOT GUNS N SHIT
<Cynder7> 6I liked the look of Uncharted 2 when I saw the add..
<Cynder7> 6I want to.. :P
<Icydragon> 12D:
<Cynder7> 6:P
<Cynder7> 6And MW2..
<Icydragon> 12Meh if that's what your into
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh, it happens
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..I took a liking to it..
<NightSeas> 12Hello HyperMetalLugia
<Icydragon> 12Transformers war for cybertron is pretty fun
<prince-dari> I really loved MW2 to be honest.
<prince-dari> Didn't like Black Ops, didn't really get into that.
<Cynder7> 6MW3 looks kinda cool
<prince-dari> Apart from zombies, that was fun.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah,I prefered MW2 too..
<Cynder7> 6Zombies scared the shit out of me when they crept up behind me..
<Icydragon> 12I'd rather play a zombie survial game I wanna get lfd2 for da pc
<prince-dari> Because they screwed up quickscopes on Black Ops probably was why I didn't like it. That was the main reason I played MW2 after I'd played the crap out of it already.
<prince-dari> Hacks on MW2 were fun as well.
<Cynder7> 6I generally just liked MW2 more..Idk why..
<prince-dari> Zombie mode. XD
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<prince-dari> Quickscope lobbies were the best part though.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey
<Icydragon> 12If only ixr were here right now hmhmhm
<prince-dari> Everyone being forced to use the intervention and only being allowed to quickscope, was so much fun.
<Cynder7> 6I wish in the Multiplayer it wouldn't put the same levels so many times..I got sick of Wasteland and Favela or whatever.. -.-
<Cynder7> 6I need to get out of my camping habits on CoD.. -.-
<prince-dari> When I first started I hated SnD. When I'd played it for ages already that was all I'd played. XD
<prince-dari> was all I'd play*
<Cynder7> 6So far I've only played DMs and something with bombs..
<Icydragon> 12Dead island looks wicked
<prince-dari> Probably demolition.
<Cynder7> 6Dead island?
<Cynder7> 6I think so..
<Cynder7> 6SnD,you just kill whoever you see in front of you?
<prince-dari> SnD I just ran around with a sniper and quickscoped people.
<Manlyguy> Weekdays. lol
<prince-dari> That's all that's left that's fun in the game after a certain point.
<Mikey> bilge dice is robbing me
<Mikey> I lost 4500 np so far
<prince-dari> Trying to get cool killcams. XD
<Mikey> BUT I CANT STOP
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Stormy> D:
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Stormy> don't get addicted to gambling!
<Mikey> MUWAHAAHAH
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> Wager your house!
<Cynder7> 6Never even thought of quickscope till I saw it a few days ago..
<Stormy> I played that game three or four times
<Mikey> ok I just earned 2k back hopefully I can get back on top
<Stormy> Lost all of them
<Stormy> then gave up
<Icydragon> 12Rawrs i don't get it
<Mikey> XD
<Stormy> I have a short attention span
<prince-dari> Final killcam just going for the 360 no scope. XD
<Cynder7> 6Whatever though..I'd just find some window,go prone and just try and snipe whoever went past..
<Mikey> DIFFERENCE HERE: I'M HOME ALL DAY, I NEED NEOPETS TO LIVE
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Stormy> I'm home all day too
<prince-dari> Hahaha, that gets boring eventually though.
<Mikey> YEAH well you're an ~adult~
<Stormy> School's out and still no job
<Stormy> So I'm pretty much a teenager now
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> Whenever I'm bored I can just rewatch pony episodes. Problem solved. (:
<Mikey> I am a small child with gaming needs
<Cynder7> 6I know..I'm just so useless when I go out there that they kill me right away so I took to camping around.. :P
<Cynder7> 6Well,when I played Black Ops I tried playing normally..didn't do too bad actually.. :3
<prince-dari> Dolphin dives are so pointless.
<prince-dari> I don't get why they put them in.
<Icydragon> 12Whenever I play online I commit suicde for fun
<prince-dari> If you could shoot while diving it'd be fun.
<Icydragon> 12And look bad ass
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Cynder7> 6Are dolphin dives only on PC version?
<prince-dari> Dive through a window while shooting someone.
<prince-dari> Cynder7: Nope.
<Cynder7> 6I was wondering about that..So you can only shoot once you've hit the ground?
<Cynder7> 6:O I never got something telling me how to do it on PS3.. o.o
<prince-dari> You hold the crouch button to do it.
<prince-dari> While running.
<Cynder7> 6That thing where you throw a knife into the air and it goes all the way to the other side of the level and actually hits someone is insane.. o.o
<prince-dari> Haha, they're pretty funny yeah.
<Cynder7> 6Aaah..Maybe I'll get to try it at somepoint..Normally shouldn't it tell you in Campaign Mode how to do it or something?
<Chimera> 04hihi
<prince-dari> Probably does, can't remember.
<prince-dari> Campaign was alright in Black Ops actually.
<Cynder7> 6Indeed
<prince-dari> I just don't really like the online.
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/f9jCV.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03guess who that is
<Cynder7> 6I didn't get too much of the online actually..
<Cynder7> 6-.-
<prince-dari> I probably played zombies more than normal online.
<Cynder7> 6I wonder why MW2 is 18+ and Black Ops 16+..Black Ops has more nasty-ish scenes or whatever..Idk..
<Cynder7> 6In Zombies,the furthest I've gotten is like Round 3..I gave up on it afterwards and started DMs..
<prince-dari> Oh, lol.
<Cynder7> 6Kino der Toten looks like a cool place though..I only played in the Pentagon..
<prince-dari> You mean Five?
<Cynder7> 6Guess..Idk..The zombie thing in Campaign.. :P
<prince-dari> The game I would definitely recommend to you though is RDR (talked about it to Lambda for at least an hour recently XD)
*Excalibur dances around
*Shadow_Lugia 6gives Excalibur a Snivy.
<HyperMetalLugia> Some old guy:
<prince-dari> I'd say probably the best game I've played on PS3.
<Excalibur> 14My god there's some awesomesauce Zebstrika art on dA
*Excalibur looks at the Snivy
<Cynder7> 6Lol :P
<prince-dari> Other than the online for MW2.
<Cynder7> 6What's it like
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wait, it's DRF XD
<Excalibur> 14that's just cruel :|
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cynder7> 6*?
<HyperMetalLugia> You can smile?!
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Excalibur> 14LOL HML
<prince-dari> It's a Rockstar game, so the same sort of engine as GTA games, free roaming, LOADS of side missions and extra things to do, ect.
<prince-dari> Except it's a western style game.
<Cynder7> 6:O :O :O
<prince-dari> The graphics are absolutely awesome, some of the scenery in the game is just amazing.
<prince-dari> It has a hell of a lot of gameplay time too, as well as an online (though I didn't play that much).
<Cynder7> 6Not that crazy about the western thing but I definitely like the free roaming and side missions..
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cynder7> 6So basically everything I'd like in a game..Awesome :O
<prince-dari> You can tie people up, put them on train tracks to get squished and stuff like that.
<prince-dari> (:
<Cynder7> 6Woo! :D
<prince-dari> There's also a fair number of minigames too.
<Cynder7> 6Sounds great :3
<prince-dari> Poker, five finger fillet, liar's dice, arm wrestling.
<prince-dari> You can break in wild horses and stuff like that.
<Cynder7> 6Nice :3
<prince-dari> But yeah, I really enjoyed RDR.
<Mikey> NP earned today: -6000
<Mikey> WOOHOO
<Icydragon> 12Dammit I can't find my ps3 :(
<prince-dari> You...Lost a PS3?

<prince-dari> What is Stormy's avatar/sig on SF from?
<prince-dari> The people?
<Stormy> oh, it's just characters from a game that I photoshopped together
<prince-dari> What game?
<Stormy> Tales of Symphonia
<prince-dari> Hmm, never heard of it.
<prince-dari> I saw that CS Lewis quote you posted on a thread in ponychan.
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> that's where I got the idea actually
<Stormy> I stole it
<prince-dari> CS Lewis is awesome.
*Rukodiora ~NP: Gradius III - Uncharged Territory (Level 10)
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> I loved Chronicles of Narnia when I was younger
<prince-dari> Same.
<prince-dari> Kind of wished they hadn't skipped out a lot of the books in the movies.
<Stormy> Yeah, I know
<Mikey> I've actually never read the books
<Mikey> and I've only seen the first movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8im back
<prince-dari> Hm, you should read them sometime, it's worth the time investment.
<Stormy> Some of the would be kind of hard to make into good movies, to be fair
<Stormy> Like the first one

<prince-dari> Well I'm leaving now anyway.
<prince-dari> Though before I do.
<prince-dari> I think cupcakes is kind of overhyped, it's not as bad as it's made out to be, and a few people think (like I do) that's it's pretty funny. The puns were good.
<prince-dari> Night, cya both later.

<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, most comedy shows go downhill after a few seasons. Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad. Even Robot Chicken started to go downhil.
<Chimera> 04seriously though WHY does Windows need to take up 19.6 GIGS?!
<Hipster_Brony> 8the simpsons was good until they started bringing in new guest stars every single week
<Hipster_Brony> 8family guy was good until it got cancelled
<HyperMetalLugia> GUess what, it's 64bit :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8american dad was never good
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why it takes up so much darn space .c.

<Nightshadow|VNC> Armageddon, you are a 8Steelix.
<Armageddon> okay well that works
<Silverscreen> 11Well, with Family Guy, I watched an episode from Season 7, where they parodied And Then there were None. The humor was incredibly lacking, though the plot was fucking badass.
<Ascendant> I'll bring up ScriptBot when I get home
<Silverscreen> 11Of course, this is all in my personal Opinion.

<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't seem to go a day without seeing something mlp-related these days
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, it can't be helped when a lot of people on TST are using mlp-related avatars/signatures and such |D
<eXAKR> I MUST RESIST M.L.P. F.i.M.
<eXAKR> SO WHY AM I WATCHING IT
<eXAKR> SODHFIHJSDOAIJOAKJWDOIJWEF
<Angel_Espeon> 13I mean, I like the show and all
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I'm not obsessed or anything
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just watch it when I feel like it :B
<Espeon> 06And that's awwrite.
<eXAKR> http://br0ny.deviantart.com/art/My-Little-Portal-207327713?offset=30
<eXAKR> WHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
<eXAKR> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<eXAKR> PONYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<eXAKR> MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<prince-dari> TO THE MOON!
*eXAKR shoots a blue portal under prince-dari, and an orange one on the moon
*prince-dari banished.
<eXAKR> You know, I got a crazy idea just now
<eXAKR> Do a comic
<Angel_Espeon> 13Speaking of Portal, I've been watching a Portal 2 walkthrough to find out why it's so popular
<eXAKR> showing various characters from other works of fiction
<Angel_Espeon> 13now I can see why, since it's full of all kinds of humour |D
<eXAKR> being put through Aperture Science Enrichment Center tests
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Espeon> 06Espeon would make glados upset by cheating.
<Espeon> 06Yeah.
<Angel_Espeon> 13wouldn't play it myself though, but I could easily watch someone else play it all day considering they're good at it :B
<Espeon> 06But that would be quite funny
<Eevee> i used guns on glados wat do
<Espeon> 06glados confirmed for SSB4 or something
<eXAKR> eg. Pokémon, My Little Pony, Sonic, Harry Potter, Ben 10, Star Wars, etc. etc.
<Angel_Espeon> 13The main reason I wouldn't play it is because portals confuse the hell out of me, but I'm kinda starting to understand how they work by watching the gameplay |D
<eXAKR> Put a Mudkip through the test
<Angel_Espeon> 13but still, I'd constantly get stuck at every puzzle :B
<eXAKR> Put Sonic the Hedgehog through the test
<eXAKR> Put Guilmon through the test
<Espeon> 06but the satisfaction when you figure it out
<eXAKR> Put Lord Voldermort through the test
<Espeon> 06what
<eXAKR> Put Darth Vader through the test
<eXAKR> etc.
<eXAKR> Also Princess Celestia
*eXAKR RUNS
<eXAKR> Oh, and the Duke
*eXAKR hides
<eXAKR> I'm sure GLaDOS will have her robot hands full with those guys
<Espeon> 06Put Gabe Newell through the test.
<eXAKR> I still can't imagine
<eXAKR> Lord Voldemort doing an Aperture Science test
<eXAKR> Magic + Science = ...
<Espeon> 06It's like matter and antimatter
<prince-dari> That actually sounds like something I'd like to see.
<eXAKR> I wonder if he could try to use the Killing Curse to hax his way through
<eXAKR> Or try to turn GLaDOS into a Hocrux
<prince-dari> Hey, eXAKR.
<eXAKR> Whut
<eXAKR> I can't let my sister find out about this
<eXAKR> me discovering MLP:FiM

<eXAKR> Or she will tease me FOREVER

<eXAKR> I want
<eXAKR> a
<eXAKR> Nightmare Moon
<eXAKR> pony figure
<eXAKR> on my desk
<eXAKR> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<prince-dari> Hasbro kind of fail at the toys BTW.
<prince-dari> They made Celestia pink.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> Also, I don't think they make NMM toys.
<prince-dari> Not that they'd make them right if they did.
<eXAKR> I WANT NIGHTMARE MOON
<eXAKR> NAO
<eXAKR> AND HAVE NIGHTMARES
<eXAKR> ABOUT THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<eXAKR> FOREVER
<prince-dari> Then you need to make one. :P
<eXAKR> :(
<prince-dari> I think I saw a custom NMM toy somewhere.
<eXAKR> I saw
<eXAKR> But
<eXAKR> :(
<eXAKR> They really don't have Nightmare Moon figures
<eXAKR> PETITION HASBRO TO MAKE ONE GUYS
<prince-dari> I doubt they'll listen to you.
<prince-dari> They can't even make Celestia's colour right, so I don't think they'll make a whole new toy.

<prince-dari> Damn, so close.
<HyperMetalLugia> Too late
<HyperMetalLugia> Not whine
<HyperMetalLugia> Share my opinion
<HyperMetalLugia> About a stupid old fad
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<prince-dari> That's not sharing your opinion, that's whining.
<prince-dari> You provide no explanation, no justification, nothing except "EW".
<eXAKR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aCDtxPUGPQ
<prince-dari> I don't care that you don't like it, but it tends to get annoying when all you ever do is say "EWW MLP" whenever someone's talking about it.
<HyperMetalLugia> You're whining about how there aren't enough toys :P
<HyperMetalLugia> And I posted my opinion on the thread about mLP
<HyperMetalLugia> *MLP
<prince-dari> First two comments I made about toys.
<prince-dari> I don't frequent the forums, I wouldn't know, all I ever see from you is "eww".
<HyperMetalLugia> Well do you want me to post a paragraph every time you talk about MLP XD
<prince-dari> Maybe just the first time.
<prince-dari> Other than that you could do what everyone else does and ignore it if you don't like it.
<prince-dari> [17:10] <prince-dari> That's not sharing your opinion, that's whining. "Whining? I am not whining, I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS IIIIIIIIIIIIS WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINIIIIIING"

<HyperMetalLugia> Worst character design ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it a boy or girl
<HyperMetalLugia> I dunno
<eXAKR> I just want Nightmare Moon
<eXAKR> I don't care
<prince-dari> Hahaha, all the main characters (other than Spike) are female.
<eXAKR> </addicted>
<HyperMetalLugia> Serious
<HyperMetalLugia> They all look MALE
<prince-dari> You probably haven't seen a male pony for comparison though.
<prince-dari> They're pretty scarce. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Does Dr. Whooves..hrm
<HyperMetalLugia> No, she's a girl too
<prince-dari> No, Dr Whooves is male.
<HyperMetalLugia> HOW ARE THEY ABLE TO REPRODUCE
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<prince-dari> Magic of course. (:
<HyperMetalLugia> Magic is over when the final HP movie comes out
*HyperMetalLugia uses 'magic' to erase MLP from TVZ

<Cat> hai :o
<Kitten> hi hi
<MisterBristle> Hello everypony!
<MisterBristle> hello?
<Hipster_Brony> yo
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry, was commenting on a ponychan thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8and also having a conversation with somepony on facebook
<MisterBristle> I see, So waht are the movies tommorow?
<Hipster_Brony> 8young frankenstein and super mario bros
<RedDragonX> I think we should just Ban Clock La for the pure fact she's useless
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Hahaha, I like the way you decide to ban members RDX.
<Stormy> I'm not sure if you're joking, but I don't think so
<RedDragonX> Depends
<RedDragonX> she openly swears and does nothing but annoy people
<RedDragonX> it's starting to bug me
<MisterBristle> ok, haha I'm having a friend over and were going to watch them (While I passively mod)
<Stormy> She's not really doing anything wrong
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Hipster_Brony> 8im going to be struggling to stay awake
<RedDragonX> so she's allowed to swear now?
<Stormy> and we can't really afford to be banning members for no reason considering the number we have
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have to be up at 6 am on saturday to run a football camp
<Stormy> Yeah, if she lets the filter catch it
<Stormy> there's never been a rule against that
<RedDragonX> Eh
<RedDragonX> in that case I just think she's annoying as sin
<MisterBristle> Do you want to run the camp or are you being forced? haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8kind of both
<Stormy> I don't find her annoying for some reason
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want to run it, but i dont want to wake up that early on a saturday
<Stormy> Usually I think those kinds of people are annoying
<Stormy> I have no idea why I don't feel the same about her =/
<RedDragonX> Well it's not really a huge reason to be annoyed
<RedDragonX> I honestly shouldn't care
<prince-dari> I don't think she's ever posted a single relevant post. Lawl.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im gonna miss most of next week too cuz i have to run another camp from 5:30-10 pm on friday
<Hipster_Brony> 8next weeks BMN i should say
<RedDragonX> but people who simply choose to be stupid when they have the ability to be a little more intelligent about how they act generally annoy me to high heaven
<RedDragonX> but eh, that's prolly just cause the forum is boring
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> Spyroforum is also kind of known for having hard-ass mods
<RedDragonX> well it's not really being hard ass
<RedDragonX> I just dont' see any point in which she is relevent about anything
<Stormy> I've seen her make on-topic posts
<RedDragonX> she just posts so she can be loud and obnoxious really, but that's prolly just my conservative brain pattern
<Stormy> Obnoxious, sure, but keep in mind I was friends with SFRB
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw, you know about the change in our selection format, right?
<Stormy> Can't get much more obnoxious than that
<MisterBristle> No? What changed?
<RedDragonX> This is true
<RedDragonX> But in essence I find such members useless
<RedDragonX> but not much I can do
<RedDragonX> excessive swearing however even with the censors will annoy me
<Hipster_Brony> 8we are doing the selection for next week live during intermission tomorrow
<Hipster_Brony> 8the entry thread is already up
<Hipster_Brony> 8and I'm inclined to start having our discussion stuff in there as well to keep it bumped
<MisterBristle> I see, Live huh? Thats gonna be intense
<Treesap> whats going on in here? Mumble is down =(
<MisterBristle> I know Treesap, IKNOW!
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi treesap
<Treesap> hi
<Treesap> oh my thunderstorms
<Treesap> everywhere!
<MisterBristle> Thunderstorms? and why is the Mumble down?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yo, just sent off the email to Sethisto
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey
<MisterBristle> 7Suddendly color
<SirSprinkles> 6Suddendly indeed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats why you really became a mod, isnt it bristle?
<Hipster_Brony> 8dunno if you saw, sprinkles, but i just sent the email about BMN to Sethisto
<MisterBristle> 7Well duh, Color makes me fabulous, and I love being Fabulous
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I saw.
<Treesap> like steven magnet
<Treesap> oh, and bristle i posted on your thread again
<Treesap> it was too long to type in here.
<SirSprinkles> 6!!Rarity autosaged my We Love !!Rarity thread...
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Staraptorhawk> hi
<SirSprinkles> 6Apparently the mods don't want ponychan becoming all about them.
<Hipster_Brony> 8fair enough
<Hipster_Brony> 8although they did archive the !!PinkiePie one
<SirSprinkles> 6The argument for that was that !!PinkiePie did something far above and beyond the call of duty to earn that thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats true
<SilverSonic> hi
<SirSprinkles> 6Whereas !!Rarity sat in one thread banning people for three hours straight.
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw, sprinkles and bristle, mod meeting at 6 PM EST tonight
<SirSprinkles> 6I saw.
<Staraptorhawk> how r u?
<SirSprinkles> 6And planned to be there anyway.
<MisterBristle> 7Fuck, what is it about?
<Hipster_Brony> 8getting stuff straightened out before tomorrow night
<SirSprinkles> 6YOUR SOUL
<Hipster_Brony> 8I emailed DCD and asked him if he could do a test drawing tonight to make sure it runs smoothly
<SirSprinkles> 6I was going to suggest that...
<MisterBristle> 7Ok then, My friend wont mind watching us meet, and he brought he's bringing his own computer so he should be good
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Kyu02)03WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD

<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> 8before the last one
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties!
<Ghosties> 4We can never have a set time for meetings lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Never.
<SirSprinkles> 6Meetings here are 20% more sporadic.
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats just how we roll
<Ghosties> 4It appears so
<Staraptorhawk> ?
<Ghosties> 4...who are the rest of these people?
<Hipster_Brony> 8*ponyshrug*
<SirSprinkles> 6They've come to take you away Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6To the funny farm.
<Hipster_Brony> 8pallaskitten has been doing the dari lurk all week
<Ghosties> 4Back to the Funny Farm?
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari is... well... dari
<SirSprinkles> 6Indeed.
<Ghosties> 4Well, as long as Lemmy is playing
<Ghosties> 4I don't mind
<Staraptorhawk> who whached dr who last week?
<SilverSonic> i havent
<pallaskitten> darilurk?
*SirSprinkles 6just ran out of food...
<SirSprinkles> 6It's when you don't leave the chat all week, just go afk
<SirSprinkles> 6As prince-dari does.
<Ghosties> 4But dari is the chatroom
*pallaskitten ran out of burger buns and now needs to use sandwitch bread
<pallaskitten> oh, okay
<Ghosties> 4But we don't talk about that
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari is never not in the chatroom
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, there was that one time his computer got unplugged.
<SirSprinkles> 6We must find out if the chat went down when that happened. Probably did.
<Staraptorhawk> belive me river song mistry will blow your mind
<Ghosties> 4Nah, I was around
<Ghosties> 4dari has powers, man
<SirSprinkles> 6Magic powers.
<SirSprinkles> 6That allow him to post in RAINBOW.
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Staraptorhawk> i got her right 4 thime gessing
<Ghosties> 4The lucky bastared
<Ghosties> 4*bastard
<Hipster_Brony> 8even though he's half-op
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much
<Hipster_Brony> 8curse that man and his knowledge of computers
<Ghosties> 4Hip, were you around for the "voice your honest opinion on the community" thread last night in /oat/?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think so
<pallaskitten> he' sprolly using some mIRC script
<Hipster_Brony> 8if it was posted after 10:30, i probably didnt see it
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<SirSprinkles> 6He is, pallas
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres some guy making rules for ponychan that are really good
<Hipster_Brony> 8like a 10 commandments type of deal
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<SirSprinkles> 6Where?
<Hipster_Brony> 8his 1st one is "love and tolerance. But remember, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself"
<SirSprinkles> 6Must. See. This.
<Ghosties> 4I actually added to the "commandments"
<SirSprinkles> 6Thread is tl;dr
<SirSprinkles> 6But looks interesting.
<Ghosties> 4Even if I am wary over the thought of an "OFFICIAL COMMANDMENTS OF LOVE AND TOLERANCE FOR BRONIES"
<Staraptorhawk> iv got a hawk orded :)
<Hipster_Brony> 8i lost the thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8i got in a heated argument with someone on facebook and stopped paying attention to ponychan for a while
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, I'm derailing your thread. Deal with it.
<Ghosties> 4Boy, it's a good thing that I'll be there for the event tomorrow. I thought for sure that Bristle wasn't going to make it, and Hipster won't be around for most of the event
<Ghosties> 4Hopefully Bristle will be around though, since it seems like things are somewhat better for him now. By the way, how is your mom?
<MisterBristle> 7My mom? it was my grandfather haha, and he's fine, thank you
<SirSprinkles> 6Info fail!
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, i'll be here this week
<Hipster_Brony> 8next week i will miss most of it
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, sprinkles, your derail was for the best
<Ghosties> 4Oh, well, I feel like a dunce.
<Ghosties> 4But at least my prayers were in the right place
<Hipster_Brony> 8good to hear that he's ok, bristle
<MisterBristle> 7No problem Ghosties, info gets messed up on the grapevine XD, but yeah I'm all cool
<Ghosties> 4Thanks, Bristle. Glad he's feeling better.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, Hip, I thought you had work tomorrow till like 10 PM?
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah, next week
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have to get up at 6 am on saturday this week though, so i might have to dip out a little early
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Hipster_Brony> 8success
<Hipster_Brony> 8i managed to derail the aforementioned heated facebook argument with a few well placed spiderman images
<Ghosties> 4What was the argument about?
<Ghosties> 4If I may ask
<SirSprinkles> 6Did you create a knifegun?
<MisterBristle> 7Spiderman solves all problems
<Treesap> fresh off of equestria daily http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was about the proper role of government in the united states
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i successfully derailed it with a "what the fuck am i reading?" image and two "nope" images
<SirSprinkles> 6That was slightly insulting.
<Ghosties> 4@Hipster: Ah, well it's a good thing that you were finally able to snuff out the flames of the argument then
<SilverSonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylhEA6Xx4Q LOL!
<Ghosties> 4What do you find slightly insulting, SirSprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just some of the stuff in the article.
<SirSprinkles> 6And only slightly.
<Ghosties> 4Like what?
<MisterBristle> 7I liked the article, it twas good
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was a little like "awww, isn't that cute, they like ponies"
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i like the publicity
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not saying I didn't like it, it just had moments that... what Hipster said.
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs* People aren't going to accept the fact that guys like G4 of MLP
<Ghosties> 4In fact, I suspect they never will
<MisterBristle> 7Hey Treesap, guess what, Servers back online
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm rocking out to Avast Fluttershy's Ass in a public cafe. Some people keep looking at my screen every now and then, but nobody really cares.
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps it's not people, perhaps it's the media
<Ghosties> 4But then, Hasbro is finally starting to acknowledge that there's a fanbase outside of the targeted demographic
<SirSprinkles> 6It really is media, for the most part.
<Ghosties> 4But even still, I didn't really like that Hasbro acknowledged us so publicly
<SirSprinkles> 6They could have gone about it better, that's true.
<MisterBristle> 7Maybe if those guys at Hasbro made Celestia's toy white, I would have more hope for better toys
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was fine with it
<Treesap> how have they made it public? I haven't seen it anywhere
<Hipster_Brony> 8i assume you're talking about the shout out in equestria girls
<Ghosties> 4Equestria Girls
<Treesap> except equestria girls
<Treesap> but even that was just one word
<Ghosties> 4Not just one word
<Ghosties> 4It was "bronies" and "DJ-P0N 3"
<MisterBristle> 7 2 words
<MisterBristle> 7bam
<Ghosties> 4Still, all I wanted was a discreet little merch bump
<Ghosties> 4I didn't want BIKINIS ON TOP, WITH MAH BRONIES and all that
<SirSprinkles> 6And it was so blatantly obvious it was directed at bronies.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<SirSprinkles> 6Even before the extended.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im fine with it
<Hipster_Brony> 8im glad they acknowledge us
<MisterBristle> 7I want MLP plushies that look good, give me that and I will be happy
<Hipster_Brony> 8it gives me hope that they will eventually release some decent merch
<SirSprinkles> 6I am too, it's all the media publicity that's related to it that I have an issue with.
<Hipster_Brony> 8bristle, agreed
<Ghosties> 4I'm glad they acknowledge us too, but a mass shout out like that isn't what I'd call discreet
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont really care if it's discreet or not
<Ghosties> 4All I wanted was like cloths merch from Hasbro's site
<Ghosties> 4*clothes
<Ghosties> 4I didn't need them shoving Katy Perry in my face
<MisterBristle> 7I already have a shirt haha, but its from ShirtBrony
<Ghosties> 4Bleh, I just hope the brony parade doesn't continue with Hasbro.
<MisterBristle> 7So you don't want Hasbro to ackknowledge us so they will cancel the show after the second season?
<Ghosties> 4Whoa, what?
<Hipster_Brony> 8katy perry = bad, brony shoutout = good
<Ghosties> 4I never once said that them not acknowledging us equals no season 3
<MisterBristle> 7I'm just saying, Hasbro isnt known for keeping MLP on for many seasons
<SirSprinkles> 6CNN seeing it and getting all their info wrong = very bad
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<MisterBristle> 7No that I agree with Sprinkles
<MisterBristle> 7*now*
<SirSprinkles> 6That's my main issue with the shoutout.
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, i loved huffpo reporting that the presentation was done by "stephen magnet"
<SirSprinkles> 6They could have done it better.
<MisterBristle> 7CNN doesnt give to shits about us, like they would take the time to get good info
<Ghosties> 4See what I mean? Hasbro made the acknowledgment so blatant with the media with Equestria Girls that all media outlets are gonna COMPLETELY blow our brony fandom out of proportion with how we operate
<MisterBristle> 7*Two shits
<SirSprinkles> 6CNN doesn't get good info about ANYTHING EVER.
<MisterBristle> 7Agreed
<Ghosties> 4It's gonna be Fox and 4chan all over again
<SirSprinkles> 6Precisely my point.
<Ghosties> 4Oh dear lord, if Fox gets ahold of us
<MisterBristle> 7"Bronies like to pretend to be nice to people, for what they call "The Friendship" a sinster variation on frienship" That's what it would be like
<Ghosties> 4My point is that there was no tact with Hasbro's shout out, that's all. They weren't thinking about the repercussions of announcing us to the rest of North America would be like
<SirSprinkles> 6"They're going to "love and tolerate" us, all right. WITH BOMBS!"
<MisterBristle> 7How did they find out our plan?
<SirSprinkles> 6That's when we go on their site and be like "Nope, with SONIC RAINBOOMS! 20% more damage in 10 seconds flat."
<Hipster_Brony> 8its not like we were a secret group before
<MisterBristle> 7And then.....Fire
<MisterBristle> 7Lol were a Subculture according to Know your meme, epic win by my standards
<Ghosties> 4The fandom is gonna explode one day
<SirSprinkles> 6We're a cult following according to wikipedia.
<MisterBristle> 7What do you mean....Explode?
<SilverSonic> wb Sky :3
<SirSprinkles> 6Explode and then explode again!
<MisterBristle> 7 0_0
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<Ghosties> 4I mean something's gonna give and our neat little community is gonna go in an uproar. Lauren Faust leaving was just a tiny excursion. I get the feeling that if we keep getting exposed like this, like mass exposure, there's going to be an eventual large scale rebellion against us. Think like the emos, or the scene kids
<Hipster_Brony> 8TEXT WALL
<Ghosties> 4The world's gonna end up targeting any guy that likes MLP and will point us out to everybody to mock and laugh at
<Hipster_Brony> 8>implying people don't already make fun of grown men who watch MLP
<MisterBristle> 7Thats a bleak outlook, and dont they already do that for the most part?

<etchersoy23> Hey guys im new
<Hipster_Brony> 8also: http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b197/FinalValkyrie/Pinkie_Pie_haters_gonna_hate.gif
<Ghosties> 4I'm waiting for the day when convenience stores in a low income country won't allow a male over the age of 18 to buy from them if they like ponies
<Hipster_Brony> 8i doubt we will ever see anti-pony laws
<MisterBristle> 7Seriously, where are you coming up with this stuff XD
<SirSprinkles> 6...anti-pony laws XD
*Obsi hugs Espeon
<aggelos_the_dragon> hi
<Ghosties> 4I didn't think we'd ever see Mexico submit to a national holiday of openly beating emo people in the streets, but that happened too
*Espeon hugs Obsi! :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8i can see us becomign a much larger community, but not THAT big
<MisterBristle> 7Mexico has a holiday of beating the shit out of emo's?
<etchersoy23> I do not like Skylanders:Spyro's Adventure
<Hipster_Brony> 8just got an email back from Sethisto, he's going to post us both today and tomorrow O_O
<SirSprinkles> 6Win.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, wtf Mexico?
<etchersoy23> Cynder isn't in there.Spyro cant talk,Spyro is MUTATED
<Ghosties> 4...hmm, okay, it wasn't all of Mexico. But there were supposedly anti-emo groups beating emo people in the streets in Tijuana
<Hipster_Brony> 8tijuana is a ridiculous place to begin with
<Ghosties> 4That's still bad, though
<MisterBristle> 7Well Emos kinda suck, and Bronies are cool, also We would totally fight back
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not sure that place has any laws
<Hipster_Brony> 8bristle: win
<Ghosties> 4I agree, I don't like emos either but I don't go around beating them up for it
<Hipster_Brony> 8emo is a much, much larger subculture than MLP too though
<SirSprinkles> 6brb guys, getting more food and I can't exactly leave my comp unattended in a cafe...
<MisterBristle> 7Well yeah I don't beat them, but why do you think that were going to get beatin up? i mean just wut? I live in Ohio, there are no crazy Mexicans here
<Hipster_Brony> 8MLP will never be that big
<MisterBristle> 7We can hope....
<Chimera> 04Hi Espy
<Hipster_Brony> 8whoa bristle, i didnt know you lived in ohio
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too
<MisterBristle> 7:D
<SirSprinkles> 6WHOA
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<Ghosties> 4All I'm saying is that I really hope our community doesn't become the target of wide scale rebellion
<Ghosties> 4That's all
<SirSprinkles> 6I doubt it highly.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think you have anything to worry about ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6The only people that really even slightly dislike us are the insecure idiots on 4chan.
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony else either doesn't care or generally likes us.
<Icy> lol
<prince-dari> Lawl rage.
<Ghosties> 4...maybe.
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs*
<MisterBristle> 7I mean I can see like crazy rednecks calling us 'FAGS' for liking MLP but there a minorty, alot of my non-brony friends think I'm pretty cool for liking it
<Icy> Why do people think we like spyro?
<Espeon> 06~~
<SirSprinkles> 6There are like, five or six bronies in my area. Most of the two towns LOVE us.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, again, brb getting food. For realz this time.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no one knows I am a brony IRL
<Ghosties> 4My best friend hates the show and probably hates the fandom
<prince-dari> I'm going to assume that wasn't a serious question.
<Hipster_Brony> 8bye sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4See ya Sprinkles
<MisterBristle> 7By Sir S.
<MisterBristle> 7*Bye*
<Hipster_Brony> 8only a handful know i have even watched an episode
<Icy> But you have to remember who your talking to
<MisterBristle> 7Dude I wore my Luna cutie mark shirt to school, everyone who asked what it was, I told them I was part of a gang, we are called "Bronies" and instead of illegal activitys, we try to spread love and joy
<Hipster_Brony> 8#winning
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont have the balls to do that
<Ghosties> 4There's no way I'd do that
<MisterBristle> 7Haha, my Luna cutie mark shirt is INCREDIABLY subtle so not that ballsy, and most people think I really funny so they just thought I was joking
<Nick> o.o
*Nick flees again
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly, the only thing i would buy that i wouldnt care at all if anyone saw would be a large rainbow dash plushie
<Hipster_Brony> 8if it were well made
<MisterBristle> 7God, I want a well made Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, or Luna plushie it's not even funny
<MisterBristle> 7*So bad it's not even funny*
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know, same for me with a dash, twilight or scootaloo one
*prince-dari points to the channel name, and topic.
<Icy> I don't get it....
<MisterBristle> 7Scootaloo? bleh.
<Angel_Espeon> 13!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Angel_Espeon is paired with Espeon
<Espeon> 06.
<Ghosties> 4Dude, Scoot's got mad skills
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Chimera> 04hawt
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130765191510.gif
*Chimera RUNS
<Espeon> 06Flawless victory.
<MisterBristle> 7Sure she can ride a scooter, but that personality
<Ghosties> 4What of it?
<Ghosties> 4She's a tomboy
<Chimera> 04yes |D
<Ghosties> 4Possibly Tsundere
<Hipster_Brony> 8so what, big whoop, want to fight about it?
<prince-dari> :P
<MisterBristle> 7Fight time? Fight time.
<Ghosties> 4One of the biggest reasons why RD was my favorite pony at first is because she's Tsundere
<Hipster_Brony> 8dont know what that means
<Ghosties> 4Tsundere means cold at first and generally unlikeable
<Ghosties> 4It's an anime term. Hell, I barely use it
<Ghosties> 4For all intents and purposes, RD's a tomboy and possibly rebel
<Ghosties> 4And that's why she was my favorite at first
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dash is my favorite, i dont know why
<Icy> CURSE YOU BRAIN YOU FAIL ME AGAIN!
<Hipster_Brony> 8possibly because shes an athlete, and i'm in to sports
<MisterBristle> 7I Heart Pinkie Pie
<Hipster_Brony> 8welcome back sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Welcome back SirSprinkles
<SirSprinkles> ty
<Hipster_Brony> 8pinkie pie annoys the ever loving shit out of me
<MisterBristle> 7Mad?
<MisterBristle> 7Mad.
<Ghosties> 4Shouldn't you like AJ since she's also something of an athlete, Hip?
<Hipster_Brony> 8she reminds me sooooooo much of the sorority girls on campus here
<SirSprinkles> 6I am Pinkie Pie, irl.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not a big fan of southern accents
<Ghosties> 4Ah. Ironically, AJ's voice actor is Canadian
<MisterBristle> 7Fluttershy is awesome to, wanna argue about that Hipster?
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats also why i dont like applebloom (u mad, sprinkles?)
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like fluttershy
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.avi
<Ghosties> 4Pinkie Pie WAS my least favorite at first
<Hipster_Brony> 8holy fuck
<MisterBristle> 7Oh thank god, to much Fluttershy hate these days
<Hipster_Brony> 8i just noticed something
<SirSprinkles> 6Fluttershy is awesome.
<Ghosties> 4What?
<SirSprinkles> 6Not in my top three, but still awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, so im assuming you all know the pinkie pie "haters gonna hate" gif
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah...
<Espeon> 06dc?
<Hipster_Brony> 8shes wearing glasses, and the "arms" of the glasses dont go over her ears
<MisterBristle> 7yep
<Hipster_Brony> 8they're attached to nothing
<MisterBristle> 7...
<MisterBristle> 7wut.
<Hipster_Brony> 8HOW DO THEY STAY ON HER FACE?!
<SirSprinkles> 6Pinkie Pie. Just that random.
<Ghosties> 4Don't think about it
<MisterBristle> 7Pinkie is so great she can levitate them on her face....duh
<Ghosties> 4And what Sprinkles said
<Ghosties> 4Pinkie Pie can warp reality, and I've accepted that fact a long time ago
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, this world has crazy magic in it, and this worries you?
<MisterBristle> 7Twlight gave Rarity Butterfly wings, your worried how Pinkie keeps glasses on her face?
<Ghosties> 4He has a valid argument. I used to wonder how Morpheus kept those damn glasses on without arms
<Hipster_Brony> 8INORITE?
<Hipster_Brony> 8that bugged me the whole movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was like they were glued on
<SirSprinkles> 6You mean they weren't glued on?
<SirSprinkles> 6I just assumed they were.
<Ghosties> 4I just eventually succumbed to the idea that he's fucking Morpheus, and he can do whatever the hell he wants
<Hipster_Brony> 8true
<Nick> hurpaderp
<Hipster_Brony> 8its because of the matrix
<Ghosties> 4That could also be true
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a glitch in the computer program
<Ghosties> 4The glasses are in the Matrix, so it's possible he programmed the glasses to stay on his face at all times despite logic
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres an anti gravity field around his eyes
<Ghosties> 4Oh my god
<Ghosties> 4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/src/130765248525.jpg
<Espeon> 06Heya~
<Nick> hi xxLatiosxx
<Nick> have a lugia plush!
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3kQk-lgFRI
<Hipster_Brony> 8this movie is a lock to eventually get selected for the B movie
<SirSprinkles> 6...Ghosties, where did you find that amazing image?
<Ghosties> 4Over in /pony/, under a "Superhero Pony" thread or something
<MisterBristle> 7You know who else can do whatever they want to? Bill Murray
<Hipster_Brony> 8yup
<Hipster_Brony> 8like in space jam
<Hipster_Brony> 8BILL MURRAY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
<Ghosties> 4I used to hate Bill Murray
<MisterBristle> 7Thats what I was referencing haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8how could you ever hate bill murray?
<MisterBristle> 7Also We watched a movie at school with Bill Murray in it, but he was there for like a second and that was it, but when he appeared I yelled "SUDDENDLY BILL MURRAY OUT OF NOWHERE" I got some weird looks to say the least
<Hipster_Brony> 8awesome
<MisterBristle> 7Dont remeber the movie though
<Ghosties> 4I just thought Bill was annoying, but then I saw Space Jam again
<Ghosties> 4And I hadn't seen Space Jam in YEARS
<Hipster_Brony> 8you know who else can do anything?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130757539634.jpg
<Ghosties> 4And Murray was easily the very best damn character in that whole fucking film
<Aristeo> Hmm.. not sure why I parted xD
<Kitten> tsk tsk
*Aristeo hugs Kitten
<Aristeo> Hi
*Kitten hugs
<Kitten> hi hi
<Aristeo> :)
<Aristeo> How have you been?
<Kitten> tired lol and you?
<Aristeo> same
<Ghosties> 4Woo, people left
<Ghosties> 4Where did Bristle go?
<Hipster_Brony> 8*ponyshrug*
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai silver
<Silverscreen> 11Howdy.
<Silverscreen> 11So I got to look at a would-be competitor for streaming movies yesterday.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Silver.
<Silverscreen> 11Some people from /rp/ stream a movie every now and then and let the people RP in the chat.
<Ghosties> 4Sup Silver!
<Silverscreen> 11Howdy, Ghosties. :D
<Silverscreen> 11Anyway, the show didn't even happen because we had to wait for someone. Not the streamer, mind you. Just...someone.
<Ghosties> 4Is that the stream that airs MSTs?
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8ive seen 2 or 3 competitors popping up
<Silverscreen> 11I think we're safe from any competition.
<Kitten> sucky
<Silverscreen> 11For some reason, none of them get organized before trying to do said event.
<Silverscreen> 11And in the end, only like five people would show up.
*Aristeo nuzzles
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, there's that. We're a pretty organized event and we usually get around 200 people every stream.
*Kitten nuzzles
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw
<Ghosties> 4I wouldn't say we have a lock on the competition, but...
<Aristeo> Maybe I can give you all of my energy and then I can go rest or vice versa?
<Silverscreen> 11We get so many people BECAUSE we're so organized.
<Silverscreen> 11People know what we're showing, when were showing it, and just all around know what to expect when they come in.
<Ghosties> 4And we also advertize
<Kitten> lol it wont work i'm already partially dozing at the keys lol so i has no energy.. apparently we both need to rest
<Ghosties> 4advertise
<Silverscreen> 11There's that to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we are channeling twilight in winter wrap up
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Silverscreen> 11...that's not true. I've yet to actually boss somepony aroun.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, speaking of advertising
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver
<Silverscreen> 11Yessir?
<Hipster_Brony> 8EQD is going to post us twice, once today and once tomorrow
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<Ghosties> 4Hey, Hip, you're on Facebook right?
<Silverscreen> 11I put a post on yesterday's Daily /oat/ thread as well.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i am ghosties
*Silverscreen 11nomnomnoms some Ramen. :)
<Ghosties> 4Do you know what this is about?
*Aristeo nods
<Ghosties> 4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35664995.html
<Silverscreen> 11What the hell?
<Ghosties> 4If this is true, this just another tiny part of the eventual backlash
<Ghosties> 4*is just
<Silverscreen> 11Pardon the french, but how the fuck are ponies offensive? o.O
<Silverscreen> 11I've heard of strange accusations, but WOW!
<Hipster_Brony> 8im guessing someone reported it
<Hipster_Brony> 8a pony hater
<Silverscreen> 11makes sense.
<Hipster_Brony> 8they have had all kinds of shit like this happen
<Silverscreen> 11All that needs to be done is send a letter to FB admins.
<Ghosties> 4 I tried to send Ponies to a friend to convert him, and it said that MLP was flagged as offensive. -what the guy said
<Hipster_Brony> 8there was a big stink when they took down a picture of 2 men kissing because it was "offensive"
<Silverscreen> 11I didn't hear of that one.
<Ghosties> 4I guess it could have been seen as advertising? I mean, I don't go on Facebook, so I don't know what their stance on it is.
<Ghosties> 4I'm referring to the guy sending ponies to his friend
<Ghosties> 4And Facebook's been getting flak for doing some low stuff recently, supposedly
<Ghosties> 4Silver's net is shitting out on him again lol
<Silverscreen> I don't know what it is, but I'm switching to mIRC again. brb.
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ghosties> 4....Lady Gaga wore ponies on a necklace?
<SirSprinkles> 6brb, have to reset my connection
<SirSprinkles> 6back
<Ghosties> 4I'll brb as well. We're not gonna be staring the meeting anytime soon, yeah? In that case, I'll return shortly
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, lady gaga is a confirmed brony

<Silverscreen> Hi, Dari.
<Silverscreen> Good to see you again.
<prince-dari> You too. (:
<Silverscreen> What you been up to?
<prince-dari> Mainly revision - lots of exams.
<Silverscreen> Fun fun fun.
<prince-dari> Hahaha, I think I said exactly that at some point.
<prince-dari> What happened about the idea of a brony IRC chat anyway?
*Aeroslash lifts head up, "Am I the only floofburd here atm? :O "
<Aeroslash> *non-shadow
<Shadow_Lugia> 6D:
*Aeroslash blinks at you

<Aeroslash> ...you remind me of someone very familar...
<Aeroslash> I just dunno who =/
<Silverscreen> We pretty much just been waiting for you to see if you'd be up to watchign the chat when the rest of us are gone.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ovo
<Aeroslash> tis a RP reference, :P
<Silverscreen> Otherwise we have a huge gap where we have no mods here to run the place.
<Aeroslash> you get a cookie if you remember it
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I think.
<prince-dari> Well sure, I can keep an eye on it, but I still think that IRC doesn't usually require much moderation - I've seen botnets come and go with no ops around. :P
<prince-dari> requires*
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Those KH stuffs? :P
<Aeroslash> ding ding!
*Aeroslash toses cookie at Shadow_Lugia
<Aeroslash> *tosses
<prince-dari> Especially when you have spam filters and such in place.
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw silver, i sent an email to Sethisto about ponies getting removed from Facebook
*Shadow_Lugia 6noms jubilantly.
<Nick> (late) *curls in terror at the poking

<Aeroslash> Are you afraid of regular floofburds, Nick?
<Nick> no
<Nick> just shadow lugias
<Aeroslash> oh, I am a regular floofer ^o^
<Silverscreen> Nice.
<SirSprinkles> 6Facebook has been flagging a lot of things, apparently.

<Silverscreen> hello.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol

<Silverscreen> Ha.
<pallaskitten> :3
<prince-dari> Obligatory, lol.
<Hipster_Brony> 8wow, sethisto already responded
<Silverscreen> What'd he say? o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said ponies on his facebook haven't been taken down
<Hipster_Brony> 8so im pretty sure it was just a specific pony hater flagging them
<Umbreon> 12!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Umbreon for 11 minutes
<Silverscreen> Probably.
<Aeroslash> wb Angel_Espeon
*Shadow_Lugia 6again pokes Nick.
*Ray noms Angel's floof
<Silverscreen> My profile pic is my Silverscreen OC, and it's still up too.
*Nick flees again!
<prince-dari> Haha, I don't do facebook anyway, I tell my friends if they want to get hold of me they can phone me. :P
<Umbreon> 12-o
*Umbreon attacks Nick
<prince-dari> That's probably home phone too - my mobile is never on.
*Shadow_Lugia 6recommends that there is a simple, pseudo-deus-ex-machina solution to this.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have facebook up all the time
<Hipster_Brony> 8never post ponies on it though
<Silverscreen> I use my phone most often.
<prince-dari> I've sent something like 10 texts in my lifetime. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8i send that many texts in half an hour
<SirSprinkles> 6I text like, two people, because I don't like texting.
<prince-dari> My friends have gotten used to it.
<SirSprinkles> 6The responses are never fast enough.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i communicate primarily through texting and facebook
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Should I just say it? :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i never call people unless i abslutely have to
<prince-dari> I see my friends every day at school anyway, and I don't know why, I just don't like facebook.
<SirSprinkles> 6Anybody here have any idea why my wifi would be blocking images registered to a site, but not the site itself?
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol i dunno
<prince-dari> Sounds like what might happen if you're behind a proxy.
<prince-dari> Sometimes images get blocked.
<Hipster_Brony> 8facebook is necessary for college
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a cafe wifi.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its how i keep in touch with my friends form back home
<Hipster_Brony> 8from*
<Aeroslash> XD nice reference, Shadow_Lugia
*Silverscreen is typing up his one RP character's backstory, and just now realized how much he's RP'd in /oat/ XD

<Shadow_Lugia> 6It has a sporking community dedicated to it. Ovo
<NewDCD> I need the stream window for it
<NewDCD> it's something related to video feed
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.

<Aeroslash> if ya want
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do you mean?
<prince-dari> Hijack?
<NewDCD> he's an experienced streamer and setting things up now. All it takes now is a bit of practice and testing
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well...
<NewDCD> well, for a few weeks
<NewDCD> we've been planning (Hipster had heard of this)
<NewDCD> a "BronyState Intermission" show
<Shadow_Lugia> 6First of all, where are you, Nick? AFK?
<Hipster_Brony> 8brb, ill be back in like 10 minutes
<Silverscreen> 11Oh yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11The invasion thing.
<prince-dari> Nope, still not with you.
<Silverscreen> 11Like with our Spiderman Stream derails.
<Nick> Im here
<NewDCD> prince-dari
<Nick> hiding
<Silverscreen> 11Only it'll be completely taken over by somepony else.
<SirSprinkles> 6I get what you're saying... I think.
<NewDCD> I'll need you to add another name to the exception list
<NewDCD> of the script
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> rather
<NewDCD> 2
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay, Nick, well, solution:
<prince-dari> You can do that, there's a command for it. :P
<NewDCD> "Redfield" and "Astray"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Catch me. :P
<prince-dari> Well Redfield was already in the list anyway.
<NewDCD> which is?
<SirSprinkles> 6!addmod
<NewDCD> !addmod Redfield
<Aeroslash> XD
<Aeroslash> O.O
<NewDCD> !addmod Astray
*Aeroslash zips lips
<NewDCD> !addAstray
<Chimera> 04o.o?
*Aeroslash gets the heck outta Dodge
<NewDCD> !add Astray
<Aeroslash> I dun wanna be caught!
<NewDCD> I have no idea
<prince-dari> It worked.
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<prince-dari> It sent you a message.
<prince-dari> [22:56] -> *NewDCD* Redfield has been added to the mod list.
<prince-dari> -
<prince-dari> [22:56] -> *NewDCD* Astray has been added to the mod list.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6If you don't allow yourself, you don't. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, so, we know what we're doing with this, I hope?
*Shadow_Lugia 6noms on fishy crackers while she waits.
<Aeroslash> :O
<Aeroslash> feesh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I do have to go in two minutes, Nick, so make it quick!
<Aeroslash> feeeeeesssshhh
<Aeroslash> feessshy crackers! :D
*Shadow_Lugia 6gives Aero a bet(t)a.
*Aeroslash blinks
<NewDCD> I didn't get it
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> I'm just waiting for Astray to finish fixing up
<Silverscreen> 11As far as I know, we've got everything covered. Just need to spread the word from one mod to another. We've changed the game of movie selection, due to TurniBrony's proclaim of deception.
<NewDCD> not that much, really
<NewDCD> only that it's live
<Silverscreen> 11Instead of raffling on the next saturday, we're gonna try doing it another way. In the middle of the stream, we'll quiet the room, and call the names of the winners few. We then use the command to give them the voice, so that they can announce their movie of choice.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im back yo
<Silverscreen> 11Word.
<SirSprinkles> 6bingbuster
<bingbuster> Yo!
<SirSprinkles> 6Would you mind coming back in about an hour? We have some things we need to take care of.
<bingbuster> 7np!
<Aeroslash|shower> brbs
<Silverscreen> 11Yo binguster, your name is ironic, 'cause I started bringing out my rhyming tonic. But if you don't mind, you gotta leave, we've got some mod duties we need to weave.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dat rhyme.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, btw DCD, before i forget
<Hipster_Brony> 8Sethisto is going to post us on EQD both today and tomorrow
<Hipster_Brony> 8and I may need to leave early tomorrow night (have to be up at 6 am saturday morning
<Hipster_Brony> 8)
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i am going to mist most of movie night next week because im running a football camp between 5:30-10
<Hipster_Brony> 8miss*
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster, dog, no need to sweat, we mods can handle one night short, on that you can bet.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good one
<SirSprinkles> 6AppulJok
<AppulJok> uhhhh
<AppulJok> i forgot that today is thursday
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<AppulJok> im a silly pony
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's cool.
<prince-dari> Ah well, some people arrive 2 days AFTER the event.
<SirSprinkles> 6We just have some mod things to take care of, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave for a bit.
<AppulJok> ok
<Silverscreen> 11You silly pony, did you lose your way? The movie night isn't for another day.
<Aristeo> Jason: I got a scholarship <33333333
<Aristeo> full presidential scholarship
<prince-dari> Are we still waiting for any mods?
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties should be back soon.
<prince-dari> And after that?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm surpised Peanut isn't here, since he's on ponychan.
<Hipster_Brony> 8bristle was here earlier
<SirSprinkles> 6Look, an anon.
<Silverscreen> 11From the top of my head, I do believe, we are missing mods, the number being three. Good old ghosties suddenly left, and we need brony and peanut to get in here yet.
<prince-dari> Look, more.
<SirSprinkles> 6Look, another anon.
<Silverscreen> 11bristle*
<Hipster_Brony> 8EQD post
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're gonna get some curious people dropping by
<SirSprinkles> 6Worst. Time. Possible.
<prince-dari> Channel called "TVEpisodeCentral" I wonder if they've got MLP on their list. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Anons left, new anon already.
<Silverscreen> 11You fellow mods, I got an idea. Let's flee to the mod room that we hold dear. The last thing we need while we are talking is more anon's doing some silent stalking.
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll still need the stream private though.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, thats the main issue
<Hipster_Brony> 8im in there already too
<Ray> 02Wb~
<prince-dari> We don't know if people are watching the stream though.
<prince-dari> Just because they're not in here doesn't mean they aren't.
<NewDCD> however, if they're not here
<NewDCD> they have no way of knowing it's live
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> we still gotta keep anons out
<Quanyails> 7Back.
<Silverscreen> 11If you don't mind, I want to discuss: What are we showing that's got to be hush hush?
*Quanyails 7pokes Nick.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hijack
<NewDCD> hijack practice
<Hipster_Brony> 8its supposed to be a surprise
<NewDCD> btw Hipster, I think you should hand the user list to the other streamer instead, but yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do you mean, DCD?
<Silverscreen> 11Now I understand why you want the chat room for mods only, So I'll get my kick boots ready for those anon bronies.
<Nick> X.O
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<prince-dari> Lol, not explanation.
<prince-dari> no*
<SirSprinkles> 6Give a reason.
<Silverscreen> 11Reaction. <.<
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, make sure you explain
<Silverscreen> 11asdf
<prince-dari> Why do we not have a proper locked room? :P
<NewDCD> miss Trollestia
<Quanyails> 7Well?
<NewDCD> we're in the middle of mainteinance
<NewDCD> would you please come back in an hour?
<Hipster_Brony> dont really need it so far
<SirSprinkles> 6lol copypaste
<Silverscreen> 11A good default message.
<Quanyails> 7I'll even re-summon S_L for you. :3
<SirSprinkles> 6Need to fix my mispelling
<Silverscreen> 11No I don't. :P
<Nick> NOOOOOOOOOOO D:
*Nick flees again
*Quanyails 7gives Nick a Master Ball.
<prince-dari> ...O_o
<prince-dari> Should just set up autokick with that message, haha.
<Silverscreen> 11THEY JUST KEEP COMING CAPTAIN!
<Hipster_Brony> 8... is that a thing dari?
<Silverscreen> 11I'm having too much fun with it.
<prince-dari> Sure.
<prince-dari> Or you could just ban all and put up expections for mods.
<Quanyails> 7Hopefully, this doesn't cause me to disconnect:
<Silverscreen> 11Didn't we do that by accident?
<prince-dari> In fact, why not do that? O_o
<Quanyails> 7INCOMING.
<Silverscreen> 11A few weeks ago?
<SirSprinkles> 6ban all would make it so people would freak out though
<Hipster_Brony> 8whatever we can do to keep people out
<prince-dari> I suppose, yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11I like what we're doing now.
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<prince-dari> Meh.
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, can you set up an auto-kick script for non-mods?
<prince-dari> Yeah, but if they don't come in with their mod nick they're going to get kicked.
<Silverscreen> 11That would be my problem.
*Shadow_Lugia 6provokes Nick. ovo
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Light_Latias02)03WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
<SirSprinkles> 6They can join another channel and change nick there.
<Silverscreen> 11Since the chat will randomly reset on me.
<prince-dari> I could set it up to recognise mod hostnames, but I haven't bothered to record all of yours.
<Silverscreen> That, and we plan on changing it after every movie to keep non-mods from discovering it.
<prince-dari> Non-mods can discover it in 2 seconds. :P
<Silverscreen> ....damn. I forgot about that.
<prince-dari> This place is lively.
<ZAquanimus> hmm?
<Silverscreen> ...still, I like changing the name. :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, it's the people here, Ghosties, Bronypeanut and MisterBristle
<NewDCD> sO
<prince-dari> Wasn't talking about nicks, was talking about hostnames.
<NewDCD> How come
<NewDCD> we have
<NewDCD> so damn many
<ZAquanimus> strange, one of my best buds is named Dari, but i know for a fact that hes at chipotle right now
<ZAquanimus> XD
<NewDCD> visitors on a non-movie day?
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD, the post on EQD went up
<Silverscreen> 11A post from EQD.
<prince-dari> I'm in the UK. :P

<SirSprinkles> 6IT NEVER ENDS
<Hipster_Brony> 8actually, it was Sethisto's idea
<Silverscreen> 11They're coming out of the woodwork!
<Silverscreen> 11oh...
<Hipster_Brony> 8i asked him to post on friday and he said he would post today and tomorrow

<Silverscreen> 11You haven't heard of Rarity Sauce's Ferris wheel?
<SirSprinkles> 6If you don't know, you don't want to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i missed the origin and the mods have a code of silence about it
<Bronypeanut> 13Wait
<Bronypeanut> 13I'm lucky?
<Bronypeanut> 13Hahahah
<Hipster_Brony> 8ive heard of it, but i missed the original thing about it
<Bronypeanut> 13Oh man.
<Bronypeanut> 13That's funny.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am the ferris wheel, silly filly.
<Bronypeanut> 13I have the thread screencaps of
<Bronypeanut> 13My "first time"
<prince-dari> I've never really understood the appeal of RP.
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Apparently Rarity Sauce as a dominatrix side to her that got unleashed while riding a Ferris Wheel with Lucky Streak.
<Hipster_Brony> 8me either, dari
<prince-dari> I tried it once - I just felt stupid. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah
<Bronypeanut> 13Well

<prince-dari> You bought a PS3? O_o
<DCD> it crashed for me
<DCD> I'm back now
<Lambda> mhm
<DCD> so far seems smooth
<prince-dari> I thought you already had a console of some kind?
<DCD> but what's with the GEMENCODER adv up there?
<Astray> oh

<ZAquanimus> everfree

<Astray> same as yours bro ?V
<Astray> :V
<prince-dari> But Lambda has RDR, so I assumed he already had either an Xbox or PS3.
<DCD> roger
<DCD> just wanted to know
<Lambda> yeah, I have a 360
<Lambda> but Stormy's wanted a PS3 for a while, and I like a lot of the PS3 exclusive games
<Lambda> so we decided to get one
<Ghosties> 4Is Astray streaming tomorrow evening?
<prince-dari> People don't usually buy both, so I was just a bit surprised.
<DCD> no
<poetzy> did i miss it?

<Astray> bro
<DCD> what does it say?

<Ghosties> 4@DCD: Arc thanked us for doing our job
<PurpleTinker> Oh yeah?
<Hipster_Brony> 8is he streaming the whole night or just for the hijack?
<PurpleTinker> That's a great idea!
<Ghosties> 4Oh, I'm not even receiving a broadcast
<DCD> he just cut it
<PurpleTinker> marketing to the herd is always fun.
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Astray> what about now?
<DCD> btw Astray
<Ghosties> 4Still skipping
<Hipster_Brony> 8still skipping pretty bad
<DCD> remember you gotta announce when you go live
<DCD> better, but still skippan a lot
<DCD> ironically
<DCD> the quality improved
<DCD> of the video, I mean
<Ghosties> Astray is streaming, or he's not streaming o.O
<ZAquanimus> yeah. and it came out of an accident that cost him some money.
<Ghosties> I am confuse
<DCD> SHOW ME THE WAY TO YOU
<ZAquanimus> the idea spawned from the accident i mean
<DCD> LEAD ME NOW WHERE YOU ARE
<SirSprinkles> 6Argh, no broadcast. I may need to restart comp.
<Ghosties> 4Skippin quite a bit
<DCD> but yeah pretty bad skippan

<PurpleTinker> 'In every crisis, there is an opportunity.'
<Hipster_Brony> 8he's streaming for the hijack for sure
<Astray> werr werr werr
<ZAquanimus> yeah. i think its gonna be great
<DCD> go with
<DCD> 400 as video bitrate
<DCD> it might work
<DCD> that said the actual image quality is pretty damn good
<Astray> most likely my faggot router

<NewDCD> quality is great

<NewDCD> oops, lotsa lag in that one spot
<SirSprinkles> 6Was talking to Astray.
<SirSprinkles> 6For killing the sound.

<Chimera> 04What
<NewDCD> might it be your connection
<Chimera> 04How and why
<Silverscreen> You mean by tomorrow?
<MIsutaaAstray> unlikely bro
<NewDCD> or your Mac?
<MIsutaaAstray> not sure
<Ghosties> 4But Astray isn't streaming the whole event
<MIsutaaAstray> lemme try on windows
<Ghosties> 4Tomorrow
<Ghosties> 4I mean
<NewDCD> yeah, I was gonna recommend just that
<NewDCD> that said
<Ghosties> 4DCD says he's streaming next Friday, though
<Hipster_Brony> 8astray is streaming the whole thing next week
<MIsutaaAstray> that said, DATASS
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.facebook.com/notes/neweggcom/best-buy-cease-desist/10150330344693572
<NewDCD> do you have screen capture software for windows?
<MIsutaaAstray> :3c
<drf|laptop> 03because they're retarded
<NewDCD> cause I could give you what I got
<drf|laptop> 03@ Best Buy, not Newegg
<Ghosties> 4That's what I'm talking about
<Silverscreen> Well...shit...we better get it working then.
<Ghosties> 4I seriously hope so
<Chimera> 04YES
<Astray> sure bro
<Chimera> 04THE HELTH BAR
<Astray> get me on msn
<Chimera> 04IT WORKS :DDDDDDDDDD
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03OK?
<Chimera> 04kinda
<Chimera> 04and um you don
<Chimera> 04't get it
<Hipster_Brony> 8sometimes i wish i knew shit about computers
<Ghosties> 4I do as well'
<Chimera> 04I was doing actionscript and I made the health bar stop animating when I told it to
<Chimera> 04which is awesome
<Ghosties> 4But even if I did, I couldn't stream since my upload speed is shit according to DCD
<Hipster_Brony> 8my upload speed is ridiculous
<Hipster_Brony> 8so if i had the audio thing, i could probably do a pretty badass stream
<Hipster_Brony> 8but im not gonna be here next week anyway, so...

<NewDCD> well, so far...yeah, a bit of lag
<Astray> what aboot now?
<NewDCD> still bad
<Ghosties> 4Why does my stream keep cutting off?
<NewDCD> even worse, perhaps
<Astray> I knew it
<NewDCD> there, now there's no lag
<NewDCD> okay, that was a bad spot of lag
<Ghosties> 4Massive lag, but can someone tell me why my stream keeps stopping?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, he turns it off to adjust it
<SirSprinkles> 6Fancy scene = MASSIVE LAG
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhh, good. I thought it was me for a moment
<Ghosties> 4@Sprinkles=correct
<Astray> let's try this again
<SirSprinkles> 6So far so good.
<SirSprinkles> 6AND THEN LAG
<NewDCD> Astray
<NewDCD> what's your UL speed?
<Astray> usually?
<Astray> high as fuck :3

<Silverscreen> ...
<Silverscreen> I'm not going to get into that.
<Ghosties> 4We're the premier Brony stream
<NewDCD> well, competition's popping out
<Silverscreen> 11WHere?
<NewDCD> sadly I won't be able to stream MST3K
<NewDCD> sadface
<Ghosties> 4Probably because this one's been succeeding
<NewDCD> well, the stream we were announced with
<Ghosties> 4Why, DCD?
<NewDCD> because of the other stream
<NewDCD> they specialize in MST3K
<Silverscreen> 11What other stream?
<Silverscreen> 11Ah.
<Ghosties> 4Man
<Ghosties> 4Bullshit
<Ghosties> 4*crosses arms*
<Silverscreen> 11nah, let them go.
<NewDCD> it's dishonorable to steal another person's thunder, so yeah
<Silverscreen> 11MST3K isn't all that good for this kind of thing
<Silverscreen> 11All the bashing is done for you.
<NewDCD> Hipster, I'll try to get you a VAC
<NewDCD> and you could become the third streamer
<bronyman> is there going to be anithing here?
<NewDCD> it's due tomorrow
<Silverscreen> 11We're doing maintenance today, Bronyman
<NewDCD> read the post in EqD o:
<NewDCD> we run on Fridays
<Ghosties> 4When does the MST stream run?
<NewDCD> 6 PM EST I recall
<NewDCD> so it should be running right now
<Silverscreen> 11On fridays?
<bronyman> understood
<Ghosties> 4So they run on Thursdays
<NewDCD> Thursdays
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ghosties> 4Well that's cool
<Silverscreen> 11Oh, then it's not much of competition if it's a different day.
<Silverscreen> 11Hell, it just gives bronies more to look forward to throughout the week.
<Silverscreen> 11Mysterious Science Ponies. SCIENCE!!!
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Ghosties> 4Hell, even I'd want to be involved in that because I'm a huge fan of MST :P

<Ghosties> 4Massive skipping, Astray : /
<Astray> ...
<Astray> srsly?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Silverscreen> 11Yes.
<Hipster_Brony> 8major, major lag for me

<Hipster_Brony> 8still lagging pretty bad
<Ghosties> 4Lag
<Ghosties> 4It's a bit better
<Ghosties> 4But the lag is still bad
<Astray> ok, now?
<Hipster_Brony> 8still lag
<Hipster_Brony> 8really bad lag
<Astray> I see
<Astray> the problem is with the encoding
<NewDCD> y'know, i think another possibility could be
<NewDCD> your graphics card
<Astray> exactly bro
<Astray> considering my computers are pretty old
<Ghosties> 4So...what do?
<Astray> kill people
<Astray> always cheers me up 8|
<NewDCD> there's another possibility
<NewDCD> I don't know how it works on Mac
<NewDCD> but mayhaps, you could give FME more priority, like with the task manager in windows?
<Astray> fucking shit :V
<Hipster_Brony> 8im starting to get real worried about next week
<Silverscreen> I think that, if we have to, we should just skip next week's BMN.
<Ghosties> 4Are you serious?
<Silverscreen> I'd rather have no stream than a stream that's lagging most of the way through.
<Ghosties> 4We'd have to go over it with the others
<NewDCD> Astray
<NewDCD> here's an idea
<NewDCD> how about you make your player smaller?
<NewDCD> and zoom in?
<NewDCD> it should be less taxing on your cards

<Chimera> 04If I make something an int and subtract it by more than it's assigend (let's say it's assigned to 5 and I subtract it by 6), does it just go to Zero?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i agree that i would rather have no stream than a shitty one
<Hipster_Brony> 8a shitty one will turn people off and we will lose viewers
<Ghosties> 4But what do we tell all the bronies?
<Ghosties> 4"Sorry, no stream next week, catch ya later?"

<Astray> still lagging like fuck am I correct?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we might have to say, due to unforseen circumstances, we have to cancel this week's Brony Movie Night, and then just push back the movies we select to the following week
<Ghosties> 4We could just put a thread up in /chat/ asking if there was someone that could stream for us and then test them out over the course of the week until we found someone that could actually be there?

<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I was thinking about that while I was typing it out. I'd rather have a streamer like DCD who we trust (or someone he trusts) than no streamer at all
<Ghosties> 4So I guess we really would have to cancel : /
<Silverscreen> On the other hand, it could build suspense....
<Hipster_Brony> 8lets not assume anything yet

<Zorin> That was inspired by an asshole security guard
<Zorin> I went with Tinker to her work building because she needed to pick up something at the office
<Zorin> While waiting for her I decided to take some photos.. and a guard got all pissy and told me I couldn't take photos. I finished taking that shot and asked him why and he was like "You have to leave now"

<SheenaFox> Dude
<SheenaFox> you would hate Aero's sister
<SirSprinkles> 6IMHO, Soldier gives good advice, but outside of it he is quite pretentious. I honestly didn't even read any of the posts in that thread outside the first.
<Ghosties> 4It's better that I don't troll out of anger
<ZAquanimus> lol yeah that was the first thing i said :P
<Ghosties> 4I don't even read what he says unless it's about a tenth of what he usually posts
<SirSprinkles> 6And even in his advice he can be a flank.
<ZAquanimus> oh dear.
<ZAquanimus> he put the guy in the can >.>
<May> 14Lol you'd hate me
<May> 14Because cats literally grow off me
<Ghosties> 4What gets me is that he always posts the same picture too
*May is made of catfloof and more of it
<Ghosties> 4For every huge post like that
<Ghosties> 4Which is about 99% of his posts
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Annoys me quite a bit.
<SirSprinkles> 6If you're going to stick with a personality, at least change the damn picture.
<Zorin> The best part is he throws away the can too and then casually walks on
<Ghosties> 4I do agree
<Ghosties> 4*sigh* I think I'm just gonna have to swallow my tongue on this one
<Ghosties> 4I can't fight Soldier now, he's too loved by the community
<ZAquanimus> x3
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm really quite neutral on him. His only redeeming quality is that his advice, while being usually quite rude, is usually good.
<SheenaFox> Aero's little sister says meow a lot
<SheenaFox> XD
<Ghosties> 4Here's how I see it
<Ghosties> 4Ponychan is an imageboard
<Ghosties> 4Most posts are quick and to the point
<Ghosties> 4They are short and usually, for the metaphor, sweet
<Ghosties> 4So you have this topic that's full of people talking to one another

<Ghosties> 4And what happens?
<Ghosties> 4Everyone immediately starts talking about the post
<Ghosties> 4And, since this is Ponychan, people LOVE it, even if they don't read it
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, there are a few ponies that do that, and it is incredibly annoying.
<Ghosties> 4Soldier hogs attention to himself
<Ghosties> 4He is an attention horse

<Ghosties> 4I seriously wanted to post a "Whoa nigga, you expect me to read all that?" image with my post reading "Sorry, but I'm posting anyways"
<SirSprinkles> 6I was honestly trying to get it autosaged, so I posted like, ten images, including caps of the post he had just made.
<Ghosties> 4Bravo sir
<SirSprinkles> 6It autosaged, but then got stickied. >>;
<Ghosties> 4Wait, so it's locked?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6It got stickied so it would still be findable.
<SirSprinkles> 6Autosage doesn't lock until quite a while after it starts.

<SirSprinkles> 6The difference between quirks and problems, is what I'm saying prevents people from being interesting or not.
<SirSprinkles> 6Problems usually having to be extremely bad, really.
<Ghosties> 4Like Soldier?
<SirSprinkles> 6I dunno what I'm saying.
<SirSprinkles> 6And yeah, like Soldier.
<SirSprinkles> 6At first it was interesting, then you realize it's a CONSTANT thing... which is annoying.

<Ghosties> 4Nice
<Drake> 04I say what
<ZAquanimus> well your name reminded me of the E-100 series from sonic
*Drake adjusts his monocle
<ZAquanimus> and sigma seems to come to mind
<ZAquanimus> and sleep happens eventually
<ZAquanimus> Estrella Noctus.... strange, two completely different languages
<ZAquanimus> must be about luna
<ZAquanimus> <3
*eXAKR plays some classical music to complement
<e117> Lol. thought it might have to do with sigmund from thw fanfic logical option. Anyway I am a sonic fan. but strictly an oldschool fan. Sega's been fucking up for a long god damn time. Im assuming the E-100 series is from an anime too. never watched the shows
<ZAquanimus> they were first introduced in sonic adventure for dreamcast
<ZAquanimus> hmm is your pen name Nomeg Stylus?
<e117> Lol sadly not Luna centric. But shes in it. Literaly every caracter is in it
<e117> btw sry for grammer. Im drunk dude
<ZAquanimus> better grammar than most sober people i know
<e117> Lol no nomeg stylus is the author of the fanfics. Im just the editor
<e117> My name is Eytan Finkelstein
<ZAquanimus> ohhhh

<e117> wait you said sonic on dreamcast> who is sigmund?
<e117> I don;t remember him in sonic adventure
<ZAquanimus> no, i just called you sigma since all the E-100 robots had greek letter names XD
<e117> Ah Verstandin
<e117> The origin of the name is much lamer then that
<Aristeo> :)
<e117> nickname/ Eytan
<e117> lol i have no idea to change it
<Eytan> there we go
<Eytan> wooo
<ZAquanimus> lol
<Eytan> Lol internet is a fucked up place. also sethisto's name is shaun and he's not a fat weirdo. thats pretty fucking higlarious
<SirSprinkles> 6...how do I not have the Patrick SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK image? o.O
<ZAquanimus> i was under the impression that sethisto was seth green. somepony lied to me x.x
<Eytan> Lol holy shi that would have been highlarious
<ZAquanimus> well seth green is a brony. >.>
<Eytan> Would have gone crazy if I realized that seth green is sexual attracted to cartoon ponies
<eXAKR> Pong
<Eytan> well is that confirmed?
<eXAKR> !ping
<drf|laptop> !pong
<Eytan> thought there was just a picture of him posing ewith a giant pinkie
<ZAquanimus> well hes got a pinkie figurine too
<Eytan> Lol for real?

<ZAquanimus> after the giant pinkie
<Eytan> What you up to right now anywhere
<ZAquanimus> ummm huh?
<Eytan> Lol arent you doing some brony realted stuff? why else are you up
<ZAquanimus> i tend to be up at this hour everynight
<Ghosties> 4Don't know, bro. You could check the mod discussion thread, I think Silver or Hipster uploaded it
<Eytan> I feel like I know more about this fandom then like 90 percent of bronies. I wonder why I've pursued his knowledge so avidly
<Eytan> Lol you crazy
<ZAquanimus> this is when my internet friends get on. heh

<Ghosties> 4And wow, I'm finally going through that Soldier love fest of a thread and found out someone's actually creating a Soldier Folder just for all of Soldier's posts
<SirSprinkles> 6I did. XD Just so I can try to autosage his threads.
<SirSprinkles> 6That way every time he posts a thread, I can go, OH, I HAVE A FOLDER, somepony will ask for it, and I can imagedump to get his thread saged faster.
<Isukra> 12well try to force it down
<Ghosties> 4It wasn't just you though, someone actually created a soldier folder just so they could use it as a guideline for lessons or some shit

<SirSprinkles> 6G'night.
<Isukra> 12well
<Isukra> 12blast
<Ghosties> 4Good night
<Ghosties> 4I would appreciate it that you didn't let people know what we were discussing
*Light_Latias asplodes
*Isukra sits
*SirSprinkles 6is just going to pull an all nighter at this point
<Ghosties> 4I'm not even tired, which is strange
<Ghosties> 4I should be tired
<Soyuz> Drake; wake uo
<Drake> 04I'm awake
<Soyuz> I haz question
<Drake> 04sure
*Light_Latias laas
<Soyuz> Okay
<Soyuz> So this mod I possess (PAX Redoran) has many quests which have many paths
<Soyuz> this quest in particular involves Molag Mar, and a Arena being built
<Soyuz> BUT the man building it is using slaves as gladiators against younger Redoran members
<Soyuz> So I'm kinda torn between the decisions
<Drake> 04...The decisions of?
<Soyuz> Allow the Arena to be built
<Soyuz> or Suspend it
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been drinking this Cran-Energy stuff, so I'm wired.
<Drake> 04Well
<SirSprinkles> 6Have enough to last me a good while longer too.
<Drake> 04Give me the arguments
<Drake> 04Why should the arena be built in the first place?
<Soyuz> So, the guy whom is building is doing it because he wants the youth of Redoran to have better experiences with fighting
<Soyuz> to know how to fight, how to survive in harsh conditions
<Soyuz> and against creatures that will kill you no matter what
<Soyuz> He is saying that people crave people
<Soyuz> and the Great House of Redoran creates fighters for this peace
<Drake> 04There is a thing called sparring
<Soyuz> He, basically, wants to train the youth of Redoran in a warrior-type fashion
<Drake> 04WHY DOES NO ONE REALISE THAT
<Drake> 04Anyway
<Ghosties> 4Well, too bad I can't just stay up as long as I want. My brother and his family are visiting and they're leaving to go spend the day out of town in the early morning. So if I want sleep, I better do it soon
<Drake> 04What would you rather do?
<Drake> 04Are you affilated with House Redoran?
<Soyuz> I'm its fucking ArchMaster
<Soyuz> aka like the Tevlanni Archmagister
<Drake> 04kthen
<Drake> 04Screw the slaves then
<Drake> 04BUILD IT
<Soyuz> Whatabouttheargumentsgainstit?

<Soyuz> Pros; the youth of redoran get more training in combat and they get "entertainment" in Roman style
<Soyuz> Besides, get Morrowind for PC also BU
<Soyuz> So you can get "Rise of House Telvanni"
<Ghosties> 4Yes it is
<Soyuz> or visit Telvanni lands on the mainland
<Drake> 04oh
<Drake> 04so there's more behind it than "Trainging Redoran:
<Drake> 04Yeahs.
<Drake> 04Go with the suspend option.
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly, I'd get sleep, if it wasn't for the fact that I know I wouldn't get up until like, 2 PM.
<Soyuz> Well it is an Arena
<Ghosties> 4Well, yes, there is that I suppose.
<Soyuz> what do you think those NPCs at the Arena in Oblivion were?
<Soyuz> Hell you actually fought three slaves from Argonia in there
<Ghosties> 4If I didn't have family visiting, I wouldn't be worried at all about sleep
<Drake> 04I never had Oblivion
<Soyuz> Which I still see as totally unfair on both sides
<Soyuz> oh
<Soyuz> yeah
<Soyuz> you can either join the Arena in Oblivion
<Soyuz> or you can bet on the Blue Team
<Soyuz> or the Yellow team
<Soyuz> and get a double of your bettings if you win
<Soyuz> most of the people whom you see in the stands are assholes
<Drake> 04o-o
<SirSprinkles> 6Must... move... higher... on... GETters... list... *twitch*
<Soyuz> betting because they will gain Septims
<Drake> 04i.e. drakes i.e. gold i.e. money
<Soyuz> don't really care if the gladiators die, unless their on the team they're betting on
<Soyuz> Yeah
<Soyuz> I go with septims
<Drake> 04I just go gold.
<Soyuz> But yeah, it's akward in Morrowind for there's a slave market in Molag Mar
<Soyuz> sorta like in Sadrith Mora
<Soyuz> except you can't buy em
<Ghosties> 4GET threads are alright, I suppose
<Drake> 04I bought a slave once.
<Ghosties> 4I don't have anything against them
<Drake> 04I was gonna give him armor to help me in combat until I realised they're useless
<Drake> 04So I set him free
<Ghosties> 4I've never even witnessed one : /
<Drake> 04I'm a good samaritan like that
<Soyuz> Your Telvanni
<Soyuz> That's like me saying the Cammona tong are all fluffy and cuddly
<Soyuz> but yeah
<Soyuz> they are
<Soyuz> they offer no benefits besides..
<Soyuz> being like the Annoying Fan
<Soyuz> or in this case the "Adoring Fan"
<Steve> 12 Hello, RedDragonX and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

<Drake> 04It was hilarious

<Soyuz> that even makes Dagoth Ur and Vivec Cringe
<Soyuz> ,,actually
<Soyuz> have you ever noticed Fargoth

<Drake> 04You've got two years
<Armageddon> they were fucking awesome
<Armageddon> or at least the first two
<Armageddon> but I need an ATAR of motherfucking 91

<Umbreon> 12ATAR?
<Armageddon> 91 is a pretty damn high score
<Armageddon> and one of the people came to speak to us today got an ATAR of 99.9 back in 2002 @ Drake ;x
<Drake> 04wat
<Armageddon> she was an ex-student of my school
<Drake> 04Is that even possible?

<Drake> 04shit
<Armageddon> ;_;
<Drake> 04I suddenly feel really pathetic.
<Armageddon> Yeah

<Armageddon> the highest is 99.95
<Armageddon> but basically
<Armageddon> if I want to get into the UNSW for an IT course
<Armageddon> I need an ATAR of at least 91
<Armageddon> and 97.85 for psychology

<Armageddon> and then a week ago, I refused to eat the pizza that my SNL had bought after it was left on the table for an hour or so
<Drake> 04o-o
