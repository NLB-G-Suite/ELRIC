<Everlasting_Joy> I love enemy tags. That makes the game so much nicer.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy doughnutjoe.
<doughnutjoe> Can I share my story of victory with you comrades?
<DaringDerpy> reported to homeland security
<Everlasting_Joy> doughnutjoe: Sure.
<Lil_B> Saturn why so much Memory? And does the GPU serve in this case as additional CPU Power?
<doughnutjoe> Thank you
<doughnutjoe> alright listen up
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Lil_B> hello doughnutjoe
<doughnutjoe> So I was just laying down on my futon and this damn roach thinks it can fly on me. So you know what I did? I smack that damn roach off of me and stood up. I saw it trying to crawl back to me. I guess it wanted to slam some more. So I beat the life out of it with a pillow and my bare hands. I proceeded to punch the roach at least 30 times before I left it there and continued watching my shows.
<doughnutjoe> sorry for wall text
<doughnutjoe> it is a great tale of victory
<Lil_B> doughnutjoe A winner is you

<Bronysith> oy Meanwhile
<CountDoofus> Haio Meanwhile
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Meanwhile!
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: the software will use the GPUs for hashing passwords. a GPU is basically a massive vector processor, and these GPUs have just over 1,500 cores each

<Jim> Kandarihu, Norway.
<Everlasting_Joy> Jim: At least you're going in with a good attitude. I hope it goes well for you!

<Everlasting_Joy> Fair enough.
<Moopy> Hey guys can i ask a question

<Ponies47|mobile> iPhone why you hate me? :<
<CountDoofus> within*
<Bronysith> Jim: ur joining the military?
<Dark_Horst> who's the other guy?
<Ponies47|mobile> Test
<Bronysith> Sumica: Wrek it keeps kicking me from game
<Bronysith> this shit
<Everlasting_Joy> Look at all of those AFK players.
<Bronysith> fuck this shit, i cant even play the fucking game

<Ponies47|mobile_> Well it was just test but iPhone hates me I'm out
<CountDoofus> Don't have Planetside 2 :<
<Dark_Horst> i would love to. but i still got no response for my beta application

<Moopy> hey is that guy still looking for the voice acter this guys youtube channel name PwaaMLPfim?
<Bronysith> one more time, but i am not going to be in the same vehicle as them cause it will glitch and kick me
<Dark_Horst> the design of those turrets on that car roof looks very... lego
<Meanwhile> Lego is best turret.
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: How do you get the game, in the sense of, is it via Steam or some other means?
<Dark_Horst> download from homepage, i'd guess
<Everlasting_Joy> K
<Dark_Horst> applied for beta there
<Meanwhile> Apply for beta, receive key, use key, receive access to client download.
<Meanwhile> Presumably.
<Dark_Horst> the receive key is the problematic part
<Alchemist> hai guise
<Everlasting_Joy> I have the same feelings when I'm sniping, "stand still!"
<Alchemist> who are we watching?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Alchemist!

<pony_5252> Maybe Firefall or Tribes?
<Vivix> What's up in here?
<Dark_Horst> Jim: i know. but paying for a game that will be released competely free doesnt really seem like the smartest ide

*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<pony_5252> Oh
<pony_5252> Heard of that.
<Bronysith> this game crashes more on me than any other bethesda game
*Vivix bites Jmo's fish
<Jmo> D:
<Dark_Horst> planetside is bethesda?
<Vivix> are you..sure?
<Dark_Horst> i dont think it is
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, you get some nice perks for paying into it
<Vivix> Bethesda don't make many games, but bethesdap publishing publishes a lot of games
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: just optics and an xp boost. that wouldnt be worth 10 bucks
<Dark_Horst> not for me anyways

*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Laurayne
*Laurayne Hugs Back
<Alchemist> Laurayne: well, when there are 200+ active uesers it can be a hectic here too :D
<Vivix> Yeah, this place can be very busy- I like it when it's calm
<Laurayne> Thats Alright Too... I Dont Mind Being Quiet And Listening... I Just Cant Keep Up Sometimes And It Hurts My Eyes...
<Vivix> yeaah
<Laurayne> Boo~ For My Bad Eyes...
<Bronysith> that server fuggin sucked for me
<Alchemist> Wait, what server were you on? Wrek is Norway and Sumi is from the US right?
<Vivix> Wrek is Swedish
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<Sumica> 00,10we were on herse EU server
<Alchemist> dammit, I forgot to put some words in my sentences...
<Laurayne> What Game Was That...?
<Vivix> you guys were trying to play planetside?
<Everlasting_Joy> Laurayne: Planetside 2.
<Bronysith> i was on the same server as Wrek and Sumica and it was being a bitch to me everytime i got into a vehicle
<Alchemist> What I meant to point out is that it will be difficult to find a server which is good for everyone...
<Laurayne> I Only Caught A Second Of It
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> hello ponies
<LightTrooper105> and Im back..
<Laurayne> Hello
<CountDoofus> Haio I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie and LightTrooper105
<Sumica> 00,10in a way Alchemist but seeing as the only thing EU about the server is it's name and general population
<alexxm> how are things Laurayne
<LightTrooper105> from admining my dam server...
<Sumica> 00,10it's not actaly loacted in the EU
<LightTrooper105> hallo CountDoofus
<Vivix> Ooh
<Alchemist> oh
<Laurayne> Uh... Things Are Ok I Guess...
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348846796711.png
<LightTrooper105> so what are you peeps up too?
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> i estimate the premire of MLP seaon 3 on oct 20 or 27
<EEVERSTI> sup
<Sumica> 00,10big shock wrek made yesterdays drawfrined
<LightTrooper105> EEVERSTI yo
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> starting oct 1st hub will show 3 epis a day[11:43:54 AM] I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious: from epi 1
<Sumica> 00,10figured he would be 5-10 as it was an OC and I was right
<Vivix> I have a bet riding on oct 13
<Everlasting_Joy> I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie: Well, at the latest, it has to be November 24th at the latest.
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> so from oct 1 52 epis/ 3 per day = a date[11:44:40 AM] I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious: plus a week
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> ok at 3 epis a day season 2 ends on oct 18th[11:48:37 AM] I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious: id put season 3 at oct 20 or 27
<Everlasting_Joy> *My knack for redundancy surprises me, and not in a good way.
<Laurayne> Ow My Eyes....
<Vivix> You make a compelling argument I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie-
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Sucks to be right?
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> ty
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> i live MLP
<Sumica> 00,10nah
<Vivix> I haven't seen wrek draw in a while-
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348814813480.jpg
<Everlasting_Joy> Vivix: He finished his Viking Pony two days ago, so who knows when he'll start drawing again.
<Vivix> Ooh the viking pony
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> my MLP youtube channel is darthcarnage3483
<Vivix> I'm gonna go check that out later
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> i have 11 vids thus far
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek Turns out I wasn't the only one getting payment error messages for Alpha. I just tried right now and it went through, too bad this laptop will not handle the game but still...
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> working on 8 more atm
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> anypony play friendship is magic epi 1?
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> it was epic
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> sorry welcome to ponyville epi 1
<Vivix> oh yeah i played it
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> it was feaking epic
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> I loved derpy
<Vivix> a bit dissapointed in how short it was- I was hoping for a CYOA like Choice of games
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Vivix> but it was scripted in lua, so since the engine is done, ep2 will probably not take six months
<LightTrooper105> now i feel like playing welcome to ponyville epi 1 again
<Vivix> it is moddable too, just look up the images and lua files, really easy to amke your own adventure
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> the only complaint was some of the voices were not so good
<LightTrooper105> it is fan made
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> the worst was the person performing scootaloo
<Vivix> I prefer no voices in CYOA, so you can have a name- but voices makes you inable to have a name
<LightTrooper105> it just show that their short in VO
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> they should also have a writer go through it and fix the grammar and such-
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> best voices were pinkie, rarity and AJ
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> almost the same as the show
<RaveBrony> bbbff on Hub <3
<Vivix> I played without voices after the tutorial
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> thats cool
<LightTrooper105> still cant wait for act 2 ><
<Vivix> no disrespect to the VA's, but I just like it without voice in text games
<Laurayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTabEPRSEeQ&feature=relmfu
<Vivix> I do wish it was more interactive though
<LightTrooper105> go suggest to them then ask them for option to disable them
<LightTrooper105> Vivix well it is their engine
<Vivix> m is the mute voices button
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> I_Love_Pinkie_Pie/Lawrence/Insidious is my skype name. If anypony would like to add me
<Vivix> yeah I like the engine, but in the lua you can add even more choices
<Vivix> and in text games i really like the option to choose whenever you have a decision that affects the mood
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> i wonder when fighting is magic will be playable in full version? meaning it is possible to play it MP
<Vivix> like talking to Trixie, you should have more than one choice direct the entire conversation
<LightTrooper105> remember Vivix this is just act 1
<Vivix> of course of course
<Vivix> but that's how those kind of novelle games play, while I'm more fond of mud or CYOA like Choice of
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> OMG yinyl was soooo funny
<Vivix> basically one choice per paragraph almost, depending of course
<LightTrooper105> hmm
<LightTrooper105> well Im studying in Game Design and Animation...
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> breaks into your house and decides to crash with u in your bed
<Vivix> I mean that's just a diference in game type-- you know? But I personally would like a lot of choices-
<LightTrooper105> i feel like making a pony game once im ready..
<Vivix> that would be neat-
<LightTrooper105> a woona game xD
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> yea the choices were kinda limited
<Vivix> do you know Choicescript? If you like writing stories, it is a great way to attempt and basic--story telling in games
<LightTrooper105> i heard
<Vivix> - the and
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> id like to get into making a pony RPG
<LightTrooper105> there are attemp or still in develpment i heard
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> cool
<Vivix> I want a linear story game
<Vivix> as a player that is
<Alchemist> like half life?
<Vivix> nnno-well, kinda but not violent
<Dark_Horst> i just watched a pony gmod video... and there was an arabian ben 10 episode in the related bar
<Vivix> or well some violence maybe, depending on the story- but just something yeah linear but with a lot of character interaction and possibility of romance or friendship
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> ok this may have been discused before, but since im new. What is the 1 thing you would love to see happen in season 3?
<Dark_Horst> sometimes i wonder about youtube
<LightTrooper105> have you tried My Little Investagation?
<Vivix> Noo-
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: I know that feeling.
<Vivix> last I saw it was just a techdemo?
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> Id love to see if scootaloo has a family or if she doesnt see her become adopted
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> by FS
<LightTrooper105> well its still under Demo
<Vivix> I dunno- that would change dynamic a lot-
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: I watched a PMV, and one of the videos was on how gender is assigned to a person :S.
<Vivix> Ahh, but yeah I saw and read about it, and it looked like a cool game
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> maybe save the scootaloo reveal for near the end of series
<Vivix> I would like more AJ info and lore background
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> she gets adopted and receives her cutie mark shortly therafter
<Vivix> but other than that- I just want ponies
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> yes more ponies
<LightTrooper105> i want a plush of ponies...
<Vivix> though, I really want to se a deer, and see if they can talk or not
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> you belive rumor of john de lance returning
<LightTrooper105> and put them on head as a thinking hat..
<LunasGuard> ello everypony

<MadSurge> Wrek: of course we like the music!
<Laurayne> I Wish I Could Stream...
<Laurayne> Theres So Much I Would Share...
<MadSurge> Laurayne: not everyone can be mods unfortunately :D wait for the request channels to be opened
<LightTrooper105> indeed
<ASoftFluffyThing> But...I suck HORRIBLY as Medic
<LightTrooper105> and the job they have to preform
<Laurayne> yay~ I Play Medic All The Time... Unfortunately Im No Good As Anything Else...
<LightTrooper105> im ok with medic..
<MadSurge> I'm alright I guess, I like healing people :D
<LightTrooper105> as long I dont shoot at enemy
<RaveBrony> I play Medic, everyone dies :D
<Bronysith> MadSurge: yea i have u on steam
<ASoftFluffyThing> More people get killed when I play medic X3
<RaveBrony> Demoman FTW!
<MadSurge> Bronysith: when's your bday?
<Laurayne> I Feel Overwhelmed When Everyone Spams The Medic Button Though... :(
<Bronysith> MadSurge: december 6th
<ASoftFluffyThing> Laurayne: I know that feel soo well
<MadSurge> Awww, ten days before my bro :3
<MadSurge> Tiny AJ! :D :3
<Laurayne> :)
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/AVV5n
<Meanwhile> I find as medic the best thing to do is ignore people asking for it and concentrate on finding the most injured.
<Bronysith> ^
<Bronysith> thank you Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Because bloody hell if people don't just enjoy pressing the button...
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - that works to a degree
<LightTrooper105> yeah
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: luckily in the servers I've been on people who asked for it really needed health
<LightTrooper105> I choose either the most injured or the one who needs it the most
<MirrorImage> besides, Meanwhile, what about the people who just fat-finger the W key?
<Laurayne> I DOnt Know Who I Should Be Healing When That Happens And I End Up Dieing Before I Get Ubercharge :,(
<MirrorImage> Laurayne - in that case, heal the fattest thing around
<Meanwhile> Prioritise people in the line of fire.
<Laurayne> Heavy Is A Good Choice For Ubercharge... Right?
<Meanwhile> More people alive means more guns means less enemy fire means progress.
<MirrorImage> if that heavy is right in the thick of things, yes
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/uDdzr
<ASoftFluffyThing> I heal those in need the most and STILL end up killing the poor person....
*ASoftFluffyThing belongs in the Medic Hall of Shame
<Spectrum_Rush> of all the times i've ever hit the E key, 10% of the time I needed a medic, the other 90% was me hitting while trying to move which is sad since my fingers ar skinny as hell or trying to hit the number keys for weapon switch :I
<Vivix> I forgot there was a medic key in TF2
<Bronysith> how do you forget that?
<Vivix> I never use it
<Bronysith> how do you forget it?
<Meanwhile> I never use it either.
<MadSurge> :D Twitroll
<ASoftFluffyThing> I try to use a nearby dispenser
<Bronysith> thats Wrek s waifu
<Vivix> Well, considering I've played TF2 maybe 20 times since 2007 or whateveritwas, it's easy to forget keys you don't use
<ASoftFluffyThing> If that counts.
<Spectrum_Rush> I'm just a klut with my fingers >.>
<Spectrum_Rush> *klutz
<ASoftFluffyThing> I have yet to use the Gunslinger.....
<ASoftFluffyThing> Probably because my aim is shit
<Vivix> I--really have no idea what anything in TF2 is called
<Bronysith> so Wrek whats ur fav metallica album again? black?
<Vivix> It is a fun game, but it's so rare that I play it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Vivix: I think Gunslinger is the one where you control the sentry yourself....lemme check
<Vivix> Ooh
<MirrorImage> ASoftFluffyThing - that's the Wrangler
<MirrorImage> Gunslinger gives you a mini-sentry i believe
<MadSurge> I am shit at every multiplayer FPS but TF2 is fun to play regardless :D
<Vivix> oh taht you can 'sling' around?
<Vivix> I am pretty shit at most games, but I still have fun
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Meanwhile> Aye Wrangler is the direct sentry control
<ASoftFluffyThing> MirrorImage: Ooh I knew it was one of those....
<Meanwhile> Gunslinger is the robot hand with the mini sentry.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I have yet to use either, to be honest
<MirrorImage> wrangler is meh in my personal opinion
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/CzEye
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> what is the best gaming headset for the purpose of recoeding gameplay
<MirrorImage> i'd rather do Gunslinger + Shotgun
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> on ps3
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'd try the Wrangler but knowing me, I'd MISS the enemy
<Vivix> if you want to record yourself talking you're best suited to get a comp'd voice mic
<MirrorImage> as for the Gunslinger itself, it's a GREAT distraction
<Vivix> like a proper XLR mic
<MirrorImage> ASoftFluffyThing - it has a bit of an aim-assist
<MirrorImage> so long as you keep the crosshairs near the enemy, it'll lock on
<Vivix> Hm
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> is turtle beach good?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaah. That will work perfect in MvM
<Bronysith> brb grabbing deliciuos sandwiches
<Vivix> I think I'm gonna have to join bronystates server and play a bit sometimes
<Vivix> MvM was fun, but I only tried it once
<Bronysith> and then battle axe
<DashWithRainbows> Vivix Word of warning, if you play Mann up mode, prepare to many round restarts.
<Vivix> Noot sure what that is- but okay, that's solo?
<MirrorImage> nice shades bro
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Wrek
<DashWithRainbows> Aaand PS2 is installed :3
<Laurayne> My Computer Would Die If I Tried Running All That On It... :(
<Panda> suddenly more Wrek
<Vivix> Recomended for all people wanting to get into youtube: Compressor, I'm sick of having to turn my volume up and down when people scream on lets plays-
<CountDoofus> Isn't Mann Up pay to play?
<MirrorImage> CountDoofus - "Mann Up" is really more of a difficulty setting
*Vivix does not know
<MirrorImage> but yes
<CountDoofus> Also, Aerosmith F- YEAH
<MirrorImage> Mann vs Machine itself is free to play, but if you want to play the Mann Up difficulty, it's 99 cents for a ticket that doesn't get expended unless you win
<Vivix> aah-
<Vivix> then I dunno-
<CountDoofus> In other words, more money for Gabe's money fort.
<Vivix> I payed for TF2 way back when, haven't played it enouh to justify the money
<Jmo> Hail Gabe.
<CountDoofus> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=300 *cough*
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> they deserve my moneys!
<Vivix> Well--for games, not so much for..hats
<Jmo> That last panel in that comic.
<Vivix> So sexy
<Jmo> I need to go purge my eyes with cleaning agent.
<Vivix> hehe
<CountDoofus> Unboxing TF2 crates isn't always bad. My medic now wears a purple confetti-spewing geisha hair thingamabob.
<Vivix> !
<BladedWings> afternoon guys ^_^
<CountDoofus> Haio BladedWings
<Vivix> Afternoon BladedWings
<Vivix> brb darlings
*ASoftFluffyThing tosses a fish at BladedWings "Hi"

*BladedWings catches fish "hi ^_^"
<MirrorImage> so speaking of crates, if anyone wants some, i got somewhere in the ballpark of 40 of them that i'm willing to sell 3 per scrap
<CountDoofus> Anyway, back to fic writing.
<BladedWings> MirrorImage: same XD
<BladedWings> What ya be playin Wreky?
<ASoftFluffyThing> CountDoofus I laughed so hard at the last panel

<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: ah cool

<Panda> CountDoofus did you know the writer is a brony?
<CountDoofus> That kind of explains the MLP references :D

<donutpop365> Oh, Wrek's streaming again.
<Laurayne> My Computer Is Lagging The Stream So Bad Its Makeing My Brain Hurt :'(
<Panda> CountDoofus, btw there is a MLP reference here too http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=306
<CountDoofus> Yup. A fairly obvious one :)
<Panda> CountDoofus, and I think he blogged it somewhere, I'm trying to find it XD
<Laurayne> lol Nice Referense :)
<Blako> hi
<CountDoofus> He even made a MLP specific comic, but deleted it from his site. Guess it caused quite a stir in the fandom, since it involved the CMC meeting an untimely end.
<Blako> new nick?
<Blako> ( xX1337Caydz0rzXx)
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> yeah :p
<Panda> CountDoofus yeah... pretty much flame from both sides.
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> lol
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> whats up
<CountDoofus> I'd link it right now, but don't think I'll be making any friends by doing so :p
<Blako> everything is fine
<Panda> CountDoofus thats what PM is for~
<CountDoofus> Ah, wanna see it then?
<Laurayne> Sorry But I Have To Pause The Stream... My PC Is Haveing A Fit...
<RaveBrony> God damn it, why is programming so hard!
<Panda> CountDoofus, yeah. I dont believe I've seen it
<Blako> at the moment, I am tryint to do point in triangle checking
*RaveBrony flips a table
*Meanwhile flips RaveBrony.
<Blako> of course it is not working :p
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Blako> but I will figure it out soon
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> triangle checking?
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> whats that
<CountDoofus> How could anyone NOT like Sweetie Belle? My heart skips a dozen beats with every voice crack she makes.
<Laurayne> Okay... Now I Have To Read Them All... Be Back In A Bit After Reading All VGCats
<BladedWings> Laurayne: thats what i'm doin lol
<Panda> Laurayne, ive been following him for years :) he is quite awesome
<Laurayne> lol
<Blako> point in triangle checking is algorythm, that check if some point [x,y] is inside triangle[x,y][x,y][x,y]
<EspyLacopa> Imagine if you could run an entire raid via song.
<CountDoofus> That "picking up quests in Mass Effect 3" comic was both hilarious and creepy.
*EspyLacopa flips Meanwhile
<Blako> I need it for sphere x triangle checking
<Panda> CountDoofus hehe but he does have a point
<CountDoofus> Also fan of the VG Adaptation With No Name.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CountDoofus, I laughed at the comic strip about Shepard being a slut.
<xX1337Caydz0rzXx> ah
<CountDoofus> "So help me God if I catch anyone else driving 10-fucking-kilometers an hour, I'm gonna drag them out of their car and beat them with oranges!"
<donutpop365> Lemons.
*Ninjazz flips himself.

<donutpop365> Forgot about the link thing.
<donutpop365> Crap.
<Panda> ASoftFluffyThing he is best slut
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: He is' isn't he.
<CountDoofus> The CAD comics also have a good point concerning Mass Effect. http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20071119
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: Let's hope he doesn't have any diseases
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: havent got to that one yet
<EspyLacopa> If you're going to beat someone with lemons, you need to use combustible lemons.
<ASoftFluffyThing> BladedWings, you'll be fine
<Panda> ASoftFluffyThing, hm... I would hope that when having sexual relations with any... thing.... he would put on a jimmy capy XD
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> lol
<donutpop365> EspyLacopa: Yep.
<BladedWings> Panda: true
<CountDoofus> Teamkiller!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: I hope so too, even though it's not shown........*shudders* I hate to think what hell he would go through if he ever got an alien STD
<Panda> ASoftFluffyThing well... then he ded XD I mean... >.> not sure why you would screw something like that.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: Not sure either.
<CountDoofus> Here's a question. If you could choose to be any race to be in the Mass Effect universe, which race would you be? I'd totally be turian.
<Panda> Meh, when you want it from somewhere you get it from somewhere ASoftFluffyThing XD
<Wrek> 05id be the oen that lives logn and fucks alot
<Panda> CountDoofus, that a hard que- OMG Wrek XD
<CountDoofus> Asari, probably :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: I think I'd rather do that to myself than with an alien.....
<Panda> ASoftFluffyThing OH! I get it. He was DRUNK!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda: OH GOD!
<CountDoofus> Hmm... Turian or Quarian. Tali is freaking adorable.

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Serenity :)
<BladedWings|Laptop> hi Serenity
<Panda|BL2> noon*
<LadyCanary> Hell nah, ASoftFluffyThing XD youuuuuuu
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: first of all, area is supposed to be meters, a trig function is unitless. secondly, its supposed to be to the second power, that formula is first powe
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Mostly for funsies.
<Panda|BL2> Meanwhile, wasnt being funny... but ok ^^
<ASoftFluffyThing> LadyCanary, no youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu :3
<twilight_sprinkle> *power
<Lil_B> hello Everybody :)

<BladedWings|Laptop> LadyCanary and ASoftFluffyThing : ladies ladies, you are both awesome ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Randomnerd: Make sure to take some pictures. :)
<Randomnerd> Sure thing!
<BladedWings|Laptop> hi Lil_B
<LadyCanary> ASoftFluffyThing: You is lady?! :O
<Meanwhile> Grena-boom.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: also, imagine you had an angle between to sides. despite having an angle, the two sides can be of any length, hence there is no way you can derive a triangle area from one angle
<Panda|BL2> AJIsAwesome *gasp*
<Lil_B> thanks BladedWings|Laptop :)
<BladedWings|Laptop> LadyCanary: i assumed?
<LadyCanary> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Panda|BL2: *GASP* :O
<ASoftFluffyThing> LadyCanary, YES i AM
<Panda|BL2> That ASoftFluffyThing is a SPAI!

<twilight_sprinkle> btw AJIsAwesome , i need to pay more attention to my schedule, apparently my exam is next week :\
<Alchemist> I was just going to say this. there is no way to determine a triangle's area with one trig equation
<Randomnerd> It's gonna be a good weekend.
<LadyCanary> I thought Sumica was a lady at first too, BladedWings|Laptop XD
<Meanwhile> What do you mean? Sumica is a lady.
<BladedWings|Laptop> LadyCanary: i just go by name until told otherwise
<Meanwhile> And he's a very pretty one too.
<Panda|BL2> what Meanwhile said :3
<LadyCanary> ^
<Serenity> hahahaha
<ASoftFluffyThing> LadyCanary, BladedWings|Laptop I thought the same thing. Lol these names
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same here. I have a chemistry test coming up.
<Serenity> Sumica is dickshep, Dickjensen and dicknico
<Randomnerd> Sumica has a rule 63 poneh
<Serenity> That's who he is
<BladedWings|Laptop> ASoftFluffyThing: true
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: there are trig equations for areas if you have two angles though
<LadyCanary> Randomnerd: And it is quite sexy.
<Randomnerd> Okay, who's in the inset stream?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yeah but i though the exam is today :D
<Panda|BL2> Sumica has a pony of ALL THE RULES
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: You did? :D
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: thats reasonable, but there is no way you can do anything with one angle.
<Randomnerd> Guy in sunglasses! Who are you???
<Panda|BL2> Randomnerd Wrek
<Randomnerd> lol
<Randomnerd> Thank you, Panda|BL2
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yeah, i was preparing until i had to run off to the class, because i didnt understand one thing, but it turned out its next week..

<LadyCanary> That's pretty nifty, brodashX_
<Panda|BL2> ASoftFluffyThing nay
<LadyCanary> XD
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Pardon, I've been ballsing the entire section up. My given text -does- say "T = 3*sin(theta)", but it simply refers to the hypotenuse, which it at 3 (units). Is it still invalid?
<Panda|BL2> Hey, Canary, you got a moment?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: do you have theta?
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Yes.
<brodashX> is there a way to get winter wrap up out of your head
<Panda|BL2> Kammerjunk, twilight_sprinkle... You've lost me
<Alchemist> is it a right angled triangle then?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: then yes, you can find the area
<ASoftFluffyThing> Fine, Meanwhile keeps his Internet and continues supplying chat with nightmare fuel. >.>
<Kammerjunk> brodashX: Hah, no.
<BladedWings|Laptop> ASoftFluffyThing: damn
<Crystaline_Shard> brodashX: replace it with love is in bloom.

<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/1XMP6.png
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|BL2: i hated my high school geometry. i was in advanced math class and my teacher was MLG and all out problems were MLG. it involved too much theory memorization so i sucked at it..
<BladedWings|Laptop> Meanwhile: that one is not as bad
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: oh, I just thought it was because you mentioned its hypotenuse.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: That's weirdly pretty. Needs more glowy jellyfishies
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Panda|BL2> twilight_sprinkle, geometry theorums were hard for me but I have no problem with psych ones XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|BL2: my memory sucks so im bad at memorizing things that dont involve logic :P

<ASoftFluffyThing> Ooooh jellyfishies. And they glow!
<twilight_sprinkle> literature is kinda ridiculous. you can find hidden meaning in anything. i can literally think of a metaphor for any word in the world

<CountDoofus> A cockatrice?
<Dester> while I agree that another draq(qord i cant spell) would be awsome I mean a changeling that moved to ponyville or the everyfree forest, but in terms another dragon or draq-athingy i agree, that would be awsome

<AJIsAwesome> I'm loving these pictures. :D
<Thorn> with out them humping your brain
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: apparently dreams about centipedes mean that you're letting your fear hinder you from getting something done or achieveing a goal
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: DAT ONE GUY ON THE LEFT
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Lobster tastes good
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't had a good dream in years. :D
<RAWRity> actually, this one fits the best. Meanwhile would be the guy in this picture: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maols4871L1qcinbmo4_1280.jpg
<Thorn> In this case your letting centipedes into your body because of fever.

<Thorn> Look at the one in the air.
<Thorn> XD
<Alchemist> but many times when I am having a bad dream I wake up to realize Im in a weird posture and about to swallow my pillow.
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: these are pictures from a haunted house. They have a surprise scare at the very end of a maze, and take people's pictures as they scare them.
<AJIsAwesome> Ok.
<Spectrum_Rush> RAWRity: that is hilarious
<Thorn> I think their reacting to the size of justin beibers dick.
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity, nah Meanwhile would be the only one in the pic that would still have a bored expression

<Stallion_of_War> I have a feeling it only goes forwards in time for two minutes or so at a time...
<BladedWings|Laptop> :D
<Stallion_of_War> Plus I'd only try that time machine with a mare.

<Serenity> Yagamilightisderpy: Yeah..
<Stallion_of_War> seems legit
<Serenity> What made you think otherwise? :S
<BladedWings|Laptop> Stallion_of_War: worked for the joker :D
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Probably thE R63 OC.
<AJIsAwesome> *the
<Serenity> Presuming Wreky drew it?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<LadyCanary> <3
<Serenity> There's your answer
<Stallion_of_War> Is it just me, or would anypony else just immediatly start snogging a R63 version of themselves?
<BladedWings|Laptop> snogging?
<AJIsAwesome> Snogging?
<Serenity> Nope, I would just to back to back warzone with myself
<IshPonyPony> ohai poner pepple
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, IshPonyPony :)
<BladedWings|Laptop> hi IshPonyPony
<Serenity> Double the Serenity, and every country would be fucked.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Stallion_of_War> I'm using that word correctly right? Snogging = making out.
<Bronysith> snogging means kissing
*IshPonyPony has a new gaming channel on youtube
<AJIsAwesome> Stallion_of_War: Oh. Well then no.
<Stallion_of_War> Of course I'm using it right. David Tennant said it.
<BladedWings|Laptop> Stallion_of_War: *AJ voice* Nah
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/JmKdt.jpg

<Serenity> Wait, wut
<Meanwhile> I'd want that game so I can do that cool thing that happens when you microwave a cd.
<Serenity> I can imagine that nothing happens when you microwave a CD
<IshPonyPony> Serenity I see what you did there
<BladedWings|Laptop> well i gotta get ready for class so see yall later tonight, hopefully XD
<Stallion_of_War> "Is it a good idea to microwave this" on YouTube
<Stallion_of_War> They should be able to tell you
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Serenity> Might fuckity fuck the files, but physically shouldn't affect it, snce CD's have no water
<IshPonyPony> The masks, they do nothing
<CountDoofus> Oh, AJIsAwesome, thanks for the dA watch :)
<Stallion_of_War> Most things either melt, explode, or catch fire
<AJIsAwesome> Too bad they don't make new episodes anymore. :(
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: No problem. :)
<Serenity> If something has water, even a trace in it, it will be affected by microwaves
<Serenity> If not, then nothing happens
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: I was wondering who made that "At The Gala" comic strip. :D
<Serenity> And notice the "in" not the on
<Stallion_of_War> See, they made an episode where they microwaved themselves, but since it was a bad idea and they died, they didn't upload it
<Stallion_of_War> because they were dead
<Stallion_of_War> and not Shaun of the Dead style zombies
<Serenity> LOL, see the conspiracy
<CountDoofus> AJIsAwesome: I wouldn't know. <_< >_>
<IshPonyPony> people are killed when they dir

<CountDoofus> Speaking of comics.

<Serenity> Hey look Meanwhile, a trixie comic

<Stallion_of_War> Someone get on that.
<Serenity> Bronysith: Oh you
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: :D
<Serenity> I love how Mariopony is just saying "I has a cutie maerk"

<AJIsAwesome> I haven't seen him.

<Serenity> Why is Applejack a raccoon?
<princess> guys ill go and be back in a hour k? :)
<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs shoulders*
<Stallion_of_War> Although step 3 could also be repurposed so WE CAN ALL BE ROBOT PONIES!
<MadSurge> Serenity: beats me, maybe because they wash apples? :D
<Stallion_of_War> Actually, all 4 stages could be repurposed so we could be ponies.
<Stallion_of_War> :)
<Meanwhile> Or...we could not.
<Stallion_of_War> GET ON THIS SCIENCE
<Serenity> I'm a warlord pony :3
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, I'm fine just being a human.
<MadSurge> ^
<IshPonyPony> Stallion_of_War is that shit for real?
<MadSurge> I kinda like my opposable thumbs :D
<alexxm> i like being human
<Stallion_of_War> Dying v. immortal robot alicorns?
<Meanwhile> All things considered I'd settle for having my brain uploaded to the robot.
<Stallion_of_War> I think it's supposed to be - http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html
<Stallion_of_War> I doubt it'd work though
<AJIsAwesome> Honestly, I don't want to live forever.
<AJIsAwesome> It would seem boring to me.
<Meanwhile> If we reached a point where peoples minds could just be stored on hard drives we'd be like a more complex version of the Geth.
<Stallion_of_War> Eventually they could construct a robot that would reconstitute itself when it gets damaged enough; perhaps 13 times?
<IshPonyPony> I want to at least live to see the destruction of humanity
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: what about deciding when you will die?
<Stallion_of_War> it would... regenerate, or something...
<Bronysith> Wrek: fuck this shit, until they fix this crashing problem i aint playing
<Stallion_of_War> Bronysith: I think that's what happens when your spaceship is shot down.
<LadyCanary> :3
<MaxTheBrony> Thanks for having me in your squad wrek :)
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I don't know. Death happens when it happends. I can't be sure.
<Meanwhile> But 6 snipers are utterly neccessary!
<Kandarihu> I would be thrilled to be Avatar B

<Randomnerd> lol snipers.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I know, plus I told them I wanted them to do it /).(\
<Stallion_of_War> The team needs 4 spies and 2 snipers
<Stallion_of_War> not a medic
<Randomnerd> I usually play medic, because I'm a wuss.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Good for you! :)

<RaveBrony> Fine this morning, horrible now.
<RAWRity> yeah, the first thing you need to know about writing: You suck at first.
<shibaru> The invite all neighbors thing is a cheat, type in the cheat, shift+click the mailbox and select invite all neighbors
<Everlasting_Joy> Shining_Star: Then I started to draw, and I feel it is getting better. I just wish I could do it more.
<Sergio_Scriptor> RAWRity: it's so true :D
<loaf> it is
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: is this not common knowledge?
<Bunny_Striker> its easy to get away with being a brony when you`re in the football team
<loaf> its also incredibly easy to procrastinate
<Bronysith> hello fellow regulars
<cowvarkian> Bunny_Striker: that seems strange
<RAWRity> Like, I remember the first thing I wrote. It was a Harry Potter fanfic and it was awful.
<RaveBrony> Hey Bronysith
<Shining_Star> Everlasting_Joy Well i wish i could have the determination like you i just cant draw after 5 minutes

<RDash5000> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand DISSAPEAR
<Barbetos> So from my kitchen when batman talks it sounds like growling.
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: it's the creepy batman phonesex voice
<otakon> bad idea Batman
<AJIsAwesome> He makes me want to cough so much.
<Barbetos> Fun!
<Silverscreen> 01,11I'm sorry, but I don't see the issue with Bale's Batman voice. I mean, it does get over the top, but it's not nearly as god-aweful as people make it out to be.
<OohShiny> pulled a batman
<twilight_sprinkle> he noclipped out
<Bronysith> so thats what that feels like
<alexxm> how does he do that
<Tovler> I disappear faster when I fart
<Cypresswolf> Joker left all the stacks with marks bills - Like a Boss
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03WHERS SCAR-CRAH?
<Bronysith> love it when he did that in the new movie
<RAWRity> it looks like a good number of the prototype vehicles used by the military
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: Creepy Stalker Batman phonesex voice
<pony_3849> bat exit
<otakon> Silverscreen: it's called hyperbole
<MrBen> It's like he's deliberately strainging his voice and going low. xD It's hilarious!
<otakon> Silverscreen: that's all
<MrBen> *straining
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silverscreen, just the over-the-top is too much for me
<Fluttercry> 05,15It really isn't that bad. How else is he going to disguise his voice?
<inkBot> if one sign doesn't work, put up another one
<Spazturtle> Silverscreen: In the later movies it can get a bit silly
<RDash5000> BEST. BUTLER. EVER.
<KaitoThePony> What if its his real voice D:
<otakon> Silverscreen: at least HE is trying considering Superman doesn't do ANYTHING but put on glasses
<XylemTube> how did we get from campy 60's TV show to this?
<OohShiny> batcave
<KaitoThePony> Lol
<magmablock> RIP Batman. Taken too early by severe throat cancer
<twilight_sprinkle> he should use one of those text-to-voice programmed voices
<princess> TressPass and you get a suprise :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Spanner_Pony: WHEREISTHETRIGGERMAN WHEREISTHETRIGGERMAAAN!?!!
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: exactly
<Silverscreen> 01,11Fluttercry: exactly.
<Meanwhile> The Batgarage.
<AJIsAwesome> Alfred 2012.
<SirGanjalf> Silverscreen: Same thing here. You can get used to it quickly
<OohShiny> dis batcave is... different
<MaxTheBrony> Love alfred!
<Michael> the batcave has to much light
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Fluttercry: theres this gas called Sulfer HexaFloride, it'd make him seem even more demonic
<String_Shredder> Ahrlfehd. Whai ahr you heeeeer?
<pony_300> silverscreen: when he starts yelling during a dramatic moment and tries to keep the gravelly voice, it gets ridiculous
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<AlienWarhead> Fluttercry a mask that covers his mouth
<Spectrum_Rush> XylemTube: uh I'm gonna say Frank Miller
*spiritwaffle holds otakon's hand
<Pale_Horse> Oh great. Now I have this mental image of Batman calling Gordon up in the middle of the night and Gordon is all like... "... So what are you wearing?"
<otakon> I get a KICK out of this hideout
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: Hope no one has a restraining order against him from calls in the middle of the night :D
<Tovler> At least there's Batman: Brave and the Bold for the rest of us.
<Sabershy> Flutterguy: I am sure a billion something dollars could make a voice changer.
<Cynder7> 6I'ma get going..see you guys tomorrow ^^
<otakon> spiffytech: :/?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Pony_300: like I said, it gets over the top.
<OohShiny> ew
<LunasGuard> bloody mess (pun)
<Silverscreen> 01,11A big dog.
<IshPonyPony> dogs, batman's one weakness
<Bronysith> i wish i couldve met adam west, but the friggin line was too much
<MrBen> And then he speaks all natural and he's like "Oh, hey, he sounds pretty awesome!"
<otakon> a BIG dog
<Tovler> Like Clifford big
<RAWRity> I loved the chemistry between Batman and Catwoman in TDKR
<Azuredragon> Changelings
<Lunac> Micheal Cine the best Alfred
<SpeedyBolt> Was he big and red?
<Bronysith> i loved TDKR
<Sumica> 00,10I threw a rock at em
<Bronysith> and TDK
<Sumica> 00,10it was a big rock
<Everlasting_Joy> One thing I do like about this movie compared to the '89 version is this one feels a little more life-life. The '89 version is very romantic and dark for no good reason..
<princess> changelings where? :o
<Bronysith> and the animated series
<otakon> Sumica: was it a ...DAMMIT
<Fluttercry> 05,15I liked Bane. I found him super intimidating
<Silverscreen> 01,11That said, I also liked Bane's voice, and was able to understand him perfectly.
<ASoftFluffyThing> That Batman voice, although effective, has to be a strain on his throat.
<Tovler> Batman vs Clifford
<MrBen> And then he tries being all badass as Batman and he just sounds hilarious.
<SirGanjalf> They could make the voice change more... subtle, but it's not that bad.
<Everlasting_Joy> Joker>Bane.
<BatBunny_Striker> I`m wearing women`s pants... yeah, I`m that sexy
<Kandarihu> Character. CHARACTER
<pony_3849> hes batman
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay
<otakon> Silverscreen: you're lucky I couldn't understand him at times
<Silverscreen> 01,11Sumica /)
<AJIsAwesome> Copycats? Don't they live in the Kirby Universe?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Bane's voice was kickass
<SpeedyBolt> Shirtless.
<SirGanjalf> ouch
<Bronysith> i would rather face bane TBH
<pony_300> Silverscreen: just sayin, that's probably the problem ppl have with it. Everywhere else, it's fine.
<Laurayne> <3
<StupidSexyCJ> except hockey pads
<otakon> BatBunny_Striker: but aren't you a guy?
<OohShiny> batman is a douchebag
<Sumica> 00,10Silverscreen (\
<Saturn> 08,01i think they should replace all the music in this film with th emusic from Batman: The Animated Series
<RDash5000> he does. in the next movie
<Lunac> stop YAYING
<pony_3849> hes batman
<otakon> Saturn: if only man
<Pale_Horse> I think a uncharacteristically heroic changeling should become the next Mare-Do-Well. :D
<MaxTheBrony> Saturn: You think?
<pony_300> I liked bane's voice too, though I missed what he was saying half the time
<RAWRity> Joker was a more intriguing villain, but Bane was both a physical and psychological threat to Batman
<Spazturtle> Silverscreen: Thye dubed Bane's voice so people could understand it
<Bronysith> cause the joker will make you fear him before death
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> yay
<EEVERSTI> yays, yays everywhere
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Bane's voice was hard to understand at the beginning but you got used to it. Too bad they goofed him up in the end.
<Bronysith> bane just beats the shit out of you
<otakon> Pale_Horse: could happen
<Fluttercry> 05,15Bane can snap you in half AND make crazy villain plots. Joker is weak and only can use others to fight
<Sabershy> Saturn: You just insulted Hans Zimmerman.
<Whistler> ..
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> 6_9
<Whistler> ....
<Michael> harvy!
<XylemTube> Arron Eckhart
<Chrysalis> they should replace all music in this film with MLP music
<p4ngya> needs more yay
<MaxTheBrony> DERPDERPDERPDERP: I hated how they fucked him up in the end :S
<BatBunny_Striker> otakon: yes, and like I said "I`m dat sexy"
<Whistler> :P
<MrBen> I think they should have done a James Earl Jones and overdubbed Bale's voice with another actor's or something.
<MaxTheBrony> I love Bane !
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I never understood why they switched Rachel's actor from the first film.
<otakon> Chrysalis: hmmmm
<Batman_Shredder> dat foreshadowing
<Bronysith> Fluttercry: but the joker is still completely insane
<SirGanjalf> Am in the only one who didn't like Bane's voice at the beginning?
<RDash5000> FORESHADOWING
<otakon> Lucky coin
<OohShiny> oh shit
<Tovler> I couldn't understand Bane at all. Which was a shame since he dropped a ton of one-liners
<Squallken> so do i
<princess> Chrysalis: your right :D
<OohShiny> he has a coin
<otakon> RDash5000: OH SO MUCH
<Jim> Elmo is best villian.
<XylemTube> Gee I wonder who that guy is
<pony_300> DERPDERP: messed up bane in the end?
<MaxTheBrony> I liked Bane From the start :)
<Michael> i liek his coin
<OohShiny> 2-face?
<Bronysith> yoshi is best evil guy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> MaxTheBrony: Yup, up to that point I would've considered him the best of the Batman film villains.
<Meanwhile> Sally.
<OohShiny> is he 2-face?
<LunasGuard> forshadowing
<Silverscreen> 01,11I was a little blindsided by the gentleman accent, but after the first scene, I realized it fit the character perfectly. A respectable psychopath.
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> he was a much better 2face then tommy lee suckass was
<[wub]ehren> Man the count destroyes elmo
<Bronysith> or kirby
<MrBen> I still haven't seen the final movie.
<Tovler> Watch it, Debbie
<MaxTheBrony> DERPDERPDERPDERP Agreed
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: COuld he be.........NAH!!!!
<BroPony|MEDIC> OohShiny: Soon...
<IshPonyPony> Kirby is best mass murderer
<princess> BootTo The Head :P
<Bronysith> is kirby or yoshi more evil?
<otakon> Tovler: I was wondering what would break first...your body or your spirit. I was not dissappointed.
<OpticalPie> Oohshiny just wait... :)
<OohShiny> Objection!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> pony_300: I won't spoiler it, but the twist pretty much topples his character.
<Forgottencrow> wow
<otakon> Silverscreen: eeyup and a genius too
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat hostility
<SirGanjalf> Well, Bane sounded a bit like Sean Connery, but maybe it's just me:$
<twilight_sprinkle> noob
<OohShiny> ouch

<MadBunny> i like feet...
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> no ceaser romero was best joker
<inkBot> i just realized, he's channeling a teen tiny bit of goldblum in this performance
<Pale_Horse> Nobody will ever be able to play the Joker again without comparing the performance to Ledger's...
<Bronysith> otakon: i like hamills joker better
<Tovler> The Brokeback Guy is The Joker? This movie is now ruined! ~2008
<MrBen> Fuck. Skipping all over again.
<MaxTheBrony> Spectrum_Rush: yeah i know :s I never get to see the picture from funnyjunk
<spiritwaffle> MaadBunny: no joke you almost killed theking o.o

<Bronysith> Fluttercry: i like hamils joker better than ledger
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> They've got every race imaginable around that table.
<Pale_Horse> Hamill is very good too. But he's typically best for the amimated appearances of Joker, in my opinion
<LunasGuard> puns
*BatBunny_Striker puts on batman mask(FINALLY!!)
<princess> brb again

<spiritwaffle> MaadBunny: i mean a spoon... realy
<MaxTheBrony> Both sounds reasonable
<MaxTheBrony> he could have done both
<Big_macinsocks> There's always a cop called Mahoney and Ramirez
<MaxTheBrony> at the same time
<Lunac> So Batman goes to China...
<Laurayne> It May Sound Bad, But I Must Say, I Kinda Like The Joker... He May Be Psycho And A Villan, But Hes Really Impressive Smart...

<Lunac> Silverscreen no It;s simply impossible cans of worms
<Meanwhile> And next up will be Arnold in a cameo.
<String_Shredder> and thn a meme cried in it's mother, Alfred's arms
<Pale_Horse> Some ponies just want to see Equestria Smoozed... :|

<inkBot> batman gets robin, joker gets harley
<pony_300> shut the fuck up this is BATMAN, woman!
<Shizuka> 13hey um batman, i think your phlegm just contaminated the scene fine
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead, the neutral evil are the worst of all.
<MaxTheBrony> twilight_sprinkle Well it makes the cape go in a cone uppwards and thus not getting so much friction in the air , so the velocity of the both body masses should be equal to Pinkie
<RosePetal> You don't blame Batman for everything!
<Tovler> hopefully Batman won't teleport mid drilling
<Bronysith> hey its that one dude from lost
<magmablock> dem hallowpoints
<otakon> yeah this bit
<twilight_sprinkle> MaxTheBrony: what i meant is that his cave might have a way to form a shape to slow down, he glides on it afterall
<Silverscreen> 01,11I find it funny that a lot of people complained about Batman NOT doing detective work, yet whenever he DOES do detective work, all people do is bitch about how wrong and innacurate it is.
<otakon> makes no sense to me
<SirGanjalf> OK, that's scene just buggers me
<Shadow_Dash454> more louder!
<Tovler> aimbot
<HarmonicDeviance> Thats cute

<Bronysith> badass morgan freeman moment in 3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silverscreen, how is it wrong and innacurate?
<MaxTheBrony> What was this guys name
<MaxTheBrony> ?
<Kandarihu> Sounds like people want to see Batman do REALISTIC detective work.

<otakon> I love that line
<pony_300> God gives you his blessings. Because you'll need it.
<taoumi> xD
<OohShiny> dat burn
<RosePetal> I would join forces with Batman and become NightWing because Nightwing is awesome.
<AJIsAwesome> Bitch, don't you ever mess with Morgan Freeman.
<Meanwhile> Yeah when you put it like that you realise the stupidity of that idea.
<shibaru> Gen says I'm being mean to her because I don't want to go to her house today and that we were planning it all week when we just decided on it yesterday :P
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: dohoho
<Shizuka> 13Silverscreen: fingerprint wouldn't survive impact

<ASoftFluffyThing> SirGanjalf: YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Sabershy> Shizuka: Yes it works everytime.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Silverscreen: I can see that happening
<CrimsonPhoenix> I WANT A FOURTH MOVIE WITH RIDDLER
<RosePetal> I knows, sad that the Nolan series didn't include Riddler in the series.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not even close
<Barbetos> Silverscreen who?
<IshPonyPony> whats the b movie?
<OohShiny> what's B movie?
<Tovler> New York Gotham > Chicago Gotham
<Bronysith> never say never
<Meanwhile> Indie-ception.
<RosePetal> I thought Nolan said he was done with Batman movies.
<pony_300> come to think of it, I would've enjoyed a Riddler more than Bane, but then that might've been too much work coming up with clever riddles and makign the entire movie a puzzle...
<Shizuka> 13don't actually care alfred!
<Silverscreen> 01,11Mister Reese. Good with numbers, good with money, and knows Batman's identity. How did he just vanish into the background after this movie?
<Barbetos> Fox?

<Lunac> Myvlen White google it
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> OohShiny: Some movie about guys watching a movie about making a movie.
<MaxTheBrony> CrimsonPhoenix i think theres some easter egg that the guy blackmailing batman is the Riddler
<Barbetos> Oh yeah
<MaxTheBrony> Theres some proof out there
<SirGanjalf> RosePetal: He is done. But the producers...
<Barbetos> That does make sense.
<princess> back
<Spectrum_Rush> Silverscreen: if I told ya why it'd be a spoiler
<IshPonyPony> whats the real b movie?
<princess> is fox there casting? :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> MaxTheBrony, still I want THE villain riddler
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 surprising scene #2.
<MaxTheBrony> true
<RAWRity> Man, the Bat-cycle really got a downgrade didn't it?
<Meanwhile> That's pretty much what it is.
<[wub]ehren> pokémon black and white
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I remember hearing that rumor about Eddie Murphy playing Riddler in the third film.
<MaxTheBrony> Its sad that theres no more nollan batmans thio
<Meanwhile> It's an indie film about filming indie films;
<Lunac> Where do you hid from hundreds of cops? Amongst them. only logical
<MaxTheBrony> tho D:
<[wub]ehren> the movie
<RosePetal> So many cops.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: is it sudden?:S

<otakon> did someone ping me?
<Spectrum_Rush> club cant even handle Batman right now
<Darf14> This is why you dont invite Batman to clubs
<Pale_Horse> My parents are deeeeeeeeead! :|
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Random Movie Trivia: The guy playing Maroney also plays a villian in the classic film, SHARKTAPUS
<IshPonyPony> George Clooney is best Batman
<RosePetal> What if they made Teen Titans movie?
<Tovler> A Bat Masterson movie would be pretty wizard
<Saturn> 08,01Abed is best Batman
<Bronysith> at least there isnt anything stupid like say a bat card or something
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: spiritwaffle did.

<Tovler> trust my trust
<Bronysith> bat toy

<Azuredragon> http://lolbot.net/pix/14819.jpg
<Lyra`> bat bar stool
<Kandarihu> Well, martial arts sequences are likened to elaborate dance routines. The least Batman could do is to work some Capoeira moves into his fighting.
<MaxTheBrony> Night alexxm Sleep well :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Bat shark repelant.
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal there needs to be a Justice League movie first
<Michael> Gnight alexxm

<IshPonyPony> Bat Lyra`
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaaand foreshadowing?

<Sumica> 00,10owwwwwwwwwwwww
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Some sort of shark/octopus combination.
<otakon> Silverscreen: true but the Mad Hatter's schtick was mind control devices and that's a little TOO outlandish for this.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> legs = broken

<princess> tell me WHERE ISH HE
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Mad Hatter is probably my favorite minor-ish villain.
<AlienWarhead> Lunac too bad
<Cypresswolf> Why hasn't Killer Croc been in a live action Batman movie yet - I bet he'd look amazing with cg tech now
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: as outlandish as fear gas made out of toxins poured into the sewer system and released via a big evaporating machine?
<Meanwhile> Batpants.
<IshPonyPony> Recoome is rhymes with Doom
<MrBen> Alrighty. Let's try this again, shall we?
<Pale_Horse> Pow!
<Lunac> Cypresswolf would need too much cgi
<RosePetal> Time to interogate.
<inkBot> the fact that he's talking is insane. i broke my arm and couldn't do anything but grunt for at least 20 minutes
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> play some Russian Roulette

<Cypresswolf> why not a body suit
<Bjornfot> But I've already done that...

<Bronysith> i just need to take half my face and dip it in acid

<SirGanjalf> Pale_Horse: Played by Charlie Sheen

<RAWRity> btw, I still find it funny that Captain Marvel is a DC character
<Meanwhile> Boomf
<Silverscreen> 01,11These posters alone prove that a Wonder Woman movie could be badass.
<Pale_Horse> pwned
<Rustymeat> BAM
<magmablock> I'm sure there have been at least a few misprints for a two face coin to be somewhere

<otakon> Firetruck?
<inkBot> MaxTheBrony, agreed :)
<Saturn> 08,01i'd have Sigourney Weaver as Wonder Woman

<Bronysith> BUFFER ON FIRE
<Saturn> 08,01she's still hot
<RAWRity> also, Man of Steel is gonna suck.
<RosePetal> Firetruck on fire.
<Sumica> 00,10so um......why not just drive on the wrong side of the road officers
<LunasGuard> HA firetruck
<[wub]ehren> man they coulda just driven on the other side of the road
<pony_101010101000101> just ass planed!
<awesomes8wc3> LOL
<Lunac> I'm from the GTA generation so seeing cops and SWAT die is GLORIOUS
<RAWRity> IshPonyPony: Batman & Robin wasn't a reboot.
<otakon> Saturn: she's too old, not busty enough AND not tall enough
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<[wub]ehren> it was all cleared
<pony_101010101000101> opps
<MaxTheBrony> Dat PUn
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity: If he were a Marvel character, he'd probably be dead now because it would look to much like a self-promotion.
<Lunairetic> theres a large enough gap infront of the fire truck
<otakon> Lunac: yeah but those guys are assholes
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i've got it: Claudia Black
<pony_101010101000101> dat accidental plan
<Lunac> otakon ?
<MaxTheBrony> FIRE+TRUCK = FIRETRUCK , ha hi ha ho ho hi
<RosePetal> I can't think of anyone to play Wonder Woman so i'm not sure.
<Squallken> for some reason this movie reminds me of the anime Trigun
<PitViper> I could see it
<otakon> Saturn: hmmm maybe
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fail
<LunasGuard> from the cut

<Gumri> anyone know how much longer this film roles for?
<Lunac> otakon GTA and the orignal Italin Job give you a taste for seeing failed cps buy it
<SirGanjalf> Pinkamena's life motto
<pony_300> Wonder Woman? Neeeh, still don't see it. But if they can do something with her outfit....
<RosePetal> MISSLE!
<LunasGuard> RPG
<otakon> Lunac: indeed

<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: most common super power?
<otakon> Also Retro City Rampage
<otakon> HE FOUND IT!
<SirGanjalf> nope, rpg
<Lunairetic> that guy had to say it
<RAWRity> then 1966 film also wasn't a film franchise. It was a continuation of the Adam West TV series.
<RosePetal> Then he gets a torpedo!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Welp
<princess> XD
<Darf14> lol
<Meanwhile> He never asked for this.
<RAWRity> Gumri: at least another hour

<otakon> Saturn: maybe she's only 5'9" however. Diana is at least 6'2"
<Gumri> Where do you live? Come to my house tonight! <3
<RosePetal> GOTTA GO FAST.
<IshPonyPony> Kevin Conroy is best Blablam
<Bronysith> Gumri: georgia
<otakon> Saturn: and built like a brick shithouse
<pony_300> so much perfect timing in this movie
<SirTornado> BOOM!
<LunasGuard> jump jet
<otakon> pony_300: agreed
<RAWRity> I go Michael Keaton>Christian Bale>Val Kilmer>Adam West>A dog in a Batman Costume>George Clooney
<RosePetal> We need some epic music for this chase.
<Lunac> otakon how do you know Wonder womans breast size so exactly?
<Sumica> 00,10so that's why they call it the tumbler
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> badum tssh
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Still better than Keaton-Batman bombing the shit out of a factory, I guess.
<MaxTheBrony> otakon O.o
<pony_101010101000101> lol
<Fluttercry> 05,15these Batman movies do give off a Deus Ex vibe
<SirTornado> RosePetal: That would just make it too epic
<Tovler> Would Wonder Woman fly since people don't know she can fly?
<otakon> Lunac: I don't but she's always been on the busty side. Hell the Powerpuff girls made a JOKE on it
<Bronysith> george clooney as batman=shit
<Gumri> well you've got a flight accross the pond then :P
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity: :D You're placement of Clooney.
<otakon> Tovler: yes
<MaxTheBrony> DID THEY?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: *your
<Lunac> otakon bust jokes are Power Girl department
<IshPonyPony> Kevin Conroy is best Batman
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: yeah they did it was like a minute joke
<Shizuka> 13freeman drive this truck

<otakon> I'll find it and link it hold on
<ASoftFluffyThing> I LIKE this job, I like it
<IshPonyPony> Kevin Conroy
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Thank you. How I missed that is beyond me.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I figured Wonder Woman and Superman would be the DC movie's version of Thor, being used to explain all the "supernatural" forces seen in the films.
<pony_101010101000101> WANT!
<Bronysith> and 60s spiderman is best spiderman
<OohShiny> transformer
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> goodbye"
<Shizuka> 13Barbetos: clearly a FREEMAN is driving
<pony_300> Transform and roll out
<RosePetal> The cop knew all about the Joker. Or he doesnt know.
<LunasGuard> transformers
<twilight_sprinkle> bai
<Meanwhile> Batbike engaged.
<MaxTheBrony> Barbetos Ofcourse hes not
<Rustymeat> goodbye
<otakon> Silverscreen: yeah good idea actually
<SirTornado> Batbike time
<Kandarihu> Poor Batmobile
<Cypresswolf> The Batman has left his car - Let's Loot It!
<RosePetal> No batmobile....
<Lunac> Silverscreen Batman is the equal to any marvel hereo
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> RosePetal: Maybe he hasn't realized Joker is following them yet. :P
<MaxTheBrony> Barbetos hes a good driver :p no talking just looking on the road
<Fluttercry> 05,15If Freeman is driving then I want to hear Ross Scott do his internal monologue
<Tovler> A Black Panther movie? Of course not
<Spectrum_Rush> Silverscreen: thats actually a really good idea
<Meanwhile> How does no one ever connect Batman to Bruce Wayne without just taking a minor glance at the stuff he's got?
<Sumica> 00,10batman gives no fucks for bad luck
<princess> takes bat man peices of car X3
<Xaiden> Hey everyone
<SirTornado> Music has finally played :)
<Cypresswolf> Bat-Tank
<MaxTheBrony> Douchebag batman
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Barbetos> The audience is the driver? Clever... I guess.
<SirTornado> And in 5 seconds it's gone
<Barbetos> Still bothers me though.
<MaxTheBrony> Ruining 500 mirrors
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Xaiden :)

<RosePetal> lol those kids.
<Barbetos> The kids broke it!
<Fluttercry> 05,15"Well, I guess the universe DOES want me dead, I escape Black Mesa, and now a psycho clown is trying to KILL me."
<Lunac> Meanwhile Bruse Wayne acts too much like an arshole in public to see viable to be batman
<awesomes8wc3> l33t
<SirGanjalf> kewl
<spiffytech> Kids are lucky they didn't die
<Silverscreen> 01,11http://fanartexhibit.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/airbrushed_ww_colour_by_joshwmc.jpg
<RosePetal> Now those kids are forever traumatized.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This part is always a stretch. Sometimes I think they make Joker TOO clever and plan too far ahead.
<Whistler> lol
<IshPonyPony> bai everypony
<Whistler> BEWSH!
<Sumica> 00,10oh come on /sweetiebelle
<Meanwhile> That's not good. Bit of an understatement there.

<Cypresswolf> Colateral Damage - Batman dont give a fuck
<RosePetal> Everyone has there opinion.
<Shizuka> 13DERPDERPDERPDERP: so the entirety of death note
<IshPonyPony> wait, is lottery tonight or tommorrow?

<Meanwhile> Shizu: Just as planned!
<Barbetos> Just doing some batman shoping.
<IshPonyPony> bai everypony
<Silverscreen> 01,11DERPDERPDERPDERP: So knowing that he'll have Arial support is thinking too far ahead?
<Sumica> 00,10dont like my driveing, get off the sidewalk
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Cypresswolf> Get out the way!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Shizuka: Hm. This is true.

<pony_300> Fuck yur trash
<Shizuka> 13at this point
<awesomes8wc3> he went dumpster diving
<LunasGuard> chicken
<Shizuka> 13i think batman has caused more property damage than the joker
<RosePetal> Jousting!
<Fluttercry> 05,15"It'd be a lot easier to get away from The Joker if I had a grappling hook"
<Silverscreen> 01,11Not to mention that he has ties inside of the police department, so he would know the route that these guys are using.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: nah, at times death note wasnt thought through nearly enough
<RosePetal> HIT ME!
<ASoftFluffyThing> I can imagine the fine Batman has to pay WITHOUT the use of Bat Credit Card.
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah but HE hasn't killed anybody
<IshPonyPony> now theres a batman>why so serious
<Cypresswolf> Shizu: Agreed
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> he missed....

<twilight_sprinkle> i actually saw a video of a car flipping like that
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Silverscreen: No, but knowing exactly the route the copter will take, how low they'll be flying, etc is a bit of a stretch.
<princess> front flip X3
<BroPony|MEDIC> inb4 Hit Me
<Silverscreen> 01,11BEST effect in the entire film.

<twilight_sprinkle> haha
<ASoftFluffyThing> lol
<spiritwaffle> hi there o3o
<pony_101010101000101> faps!
<Sumica> 00,10there are no yays
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: why dont they wipe his face?
<RosePetal> dat slap.
<pony_300> Dat improvisment by Joker
<Meanwhile> Bap.
<Pale_Horse> *slap*
<princess> hi DJ_PON-3|I
<DJ_POn-3|I> i made a new O.C.
<oneoneeighteight> slap then hugs
<Barbetos> what do the five fingers say to tha face?
<MaxTheBrony> WHY?
<Tovler> inb4 divorce
<Barbetos> SLAP!!
<MaxTheBrony> I dont SEE THE POINT OF THIS?
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal Fluttershy is everywhere at once
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I'm at the point where I can't even hear the yays anymore
<Bronysith> i just took my headset off and i heard that bitch smack
<MaxTheBrony> Why put him In a Public Cell!?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Aircrafter> I'd love to be stuck in a cell with The Joker.
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: not enough time to process him
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Probably because it would take time they don't care to waste?
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Joker's applause was not scripted. Ledger did it on a whim and Nolan liked it so much that he kept it in the film.
<otakon> Aircrafter: you'd be ded
<MaxTheBrony> He should go to Arkham Dirctly?
<CK|Ded> MaxTheBrony: Because dumb
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<otakon> Silverscreen: awesome
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aircrafter, you sure about that?
<otakon> Silverscreen: just goddamn awesome
<Bronysith> and ledgers sexiness would melt everyones faces
<Xaiden> Aircrafter: *facepalm*
<Kandarihu> It's all a matter of volume. I can still hear the yays when it's quiet, not when it's loud.
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: THAT IS AWESOME.
<Sumica> 00,10that's how in to the role he was
<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<otakon> too bad he's dead

<Xaiden> CrimsonPhoenix: Becuz Jonny plays roles like this
