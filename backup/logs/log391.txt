<unfoundbug> that like mmmmmbananas
<BritishBrony> Apparently 4 hours of sleep a night is bad for you and leads to a shorter life... But they said 4 hours is the best amount of sleep possible on QI. Goddamnit.
<unfoundbug> QI > any other source of knowledge
<Yahooz> IMO 12 hs of sleep is best sleep
<Jaegerpony> Communists - Socialist Labour - Centre - Liberal Democrats - New Labour - Conservatives - UKIP - BNP - Left wing American Parties - Right wing American Parties - Facists
<BritishBrony> Yes.

<Pinkieruler124> Here derpy
<Roflbot> hehe
<Cypresswolf> My lava lamp broke, hardened into an unmeltable mass
<ScootaChicken> oh yeah, I remember you

<Pinkieruler124> Umm can we look at tv now?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> ScootaChicken: which one were you?
<sharklion> i have one of those waterproof mp3 speakers
<ScootaChicken> RainbowcrashNBurn: the one with the long black hair and the guitar
<sharklion> was this the meet in London pub?
<Cypresswolf> I wonder how many ware houses the Mythbusters had to move into during the filming of this series...
<Pinkieruler124> Im making bluebarry muffens
<ScootaChicken> sharklion: it was a lot more informal and less structured, plus there were a lot less people

<Jaegerpony> icing, caster, granulated, brown or muscovado?
<Pinkieruler124> Dont you there
<Jim> I didn't know that was a myth
*sharklion gives pinkieruler124 sugar and arsenic
<Jim> That seems like a reasonable thing to avoid
<Pinkieruler124> Just normal suger
<RoseyPony> fail
<flutter_spin> You realize they usually take the original myth and say "lets go ALL THE WAY!"
<Cypresswolf> all this electrocution talk made me think...what happens if Wolverine gets electrocuted like this
<AllisZero> Scary sign of times when a 3-year-old phone has better reception than a state-of-the-art smartphone
<sharklion> hehe
<CCCP> Jim: but then how can i text in the shower?
*Pinkieruler124 Makes bluebarry muffens

<Dashie_Dashie> 1080p rips
<Dashie_Dashie> and suddenly the chat feel dead.
<Tovler> 1080 upconverted iTunes rips?
<ScootaChicken> looks like pony_915 finally got the right idea.
<CK|Asleep> I just find the troll boring. Whatever happened to decent trolling? It's become a lost art.
<WafflesLovesDerpy> BLAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Dashie_Dashie> nnope
<Shizuka> 13never really was an art
<Pinkies4thWall> What u use to torrent?
<Shizuka> 13more like
<Jim> Trolling is an art
<ScootaChicken> CK|Asleep: it is still performed today by RAWRity and Meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13throwing paint at a canvas and pretending it's art
<ScootaChicken> they're just restrained about it.
<Shizuka> 13except it's not paint
<Shizuka> 13and it's not a canvas
<Tovler> I gave the troll an idea, and went away to get started on it.
<unfoundbug> old fassioned trolling was at least amusing
<Dashie_Dashie> plutonic dry humping = trolling.

<Everlasting_Joy> I'm quite happy they pushed it to 12:00CST. I need the sleep.
<herp-a-derp> something tells me half the trolls dont know the literal definition of trolling
<CK|Asleep> Shizuka: If I had to stomach the notion that dolphin sounds are considered "music" in my Music Appreciation class, then I'm obligated to accept splatter on a canvas as art too.
<CK|Asleep> :p
<otakon> I haven't seen him in quite awhile
*Ish[RndmPronoun]Pony hugz and nomz otakon, ScootaChicken, Jim, and Everlasting_Joy

<WafflesLovesDerpy> Everything is random.
<Vinyl> Indeed
<pony_915> 6_9derp derp derpy6_9<3<3i love derpy i can fuck her so bad
<ScootaChicken> I agree with Shizuka
<flutter_spin> Ever see Marie from Everybody Loves Raymond? Telling my mom that I would prefer doing it myself is like admitting I hate her

<TrixieMuffin> link ?
<flutter_spin> People say its Lily Blossom
<Tovler> We need Machete. It was Machete who saved Speedy Gonzales. He can save Derpy.
<Photon-Phoenix> Tom, see above
<PinkiePieCopy> Herostar why not
<Photon-Phoenix> umm
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03crud, brb!
<Photon-Phoenix> TrixieMuffin
<Photon-Phoenix> tab failed
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Scoot-Scootaloo: i couldnt bring myself to finish watching, it made me sadder than reading my little dashie
<CCCP> Tovler: there must be a way. First of all we could explain to Hasbro that derpy hooves is not mentally disabled. And even if she was should they censor a Mentally disabled person? Patrick from sponge bob is meantally retarded but hes not sensored.
<flutter_spin> Fluttershy expresses herself in one word: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXgFZgnivXs
<RoseyPony> hmm well then
<CCCP> Us fans love derpy hooves and it really hurts us too her be changed
<Mutterguy> I thought partick was just a starfish- he has no brain
<RoseyPony> i completely agree with you there CCCP
<flutter_spin> I'm not that deep. I see that they DID do the whole derpy thing. I see they ARE making changes. I see the community making AWESOME videos (like the sad derpy). I don't care what happens honestly. The memories are still there.
<CCCP> Mutterguy: okay then what about the other stupid pony in the episode with Trixie? He was clearly retared
<Tovler> Or tell Hasbro that is was an accident that all of Derpy's prior appearances were of her wrecking stuff. The Derpy character deserves a second chance.
<flutter_spin> My mind will just reject the changes made and accept that derpy will always be derpy. I don't see her gone
<CCCP> flutter_spin: so u wouldn't even be slightly happy if u saw derpy hooves changed back?
<Gunthler> guys i'm thinking about going to McDonalds and ordering a happy meal just to get 1 of each pony they offer :L
<flutter_spin> Well I'm weird that way. Right now I can't even accept that derpy has been changed. Right now I still see her as I saw her in the original episode.
<RoseyPony> ohh McD has MLP toys right now?
<flutter_spin> March 5th
<Gunthler> Ye
<CCCP> flutter_spin: i get what u mean.
<Ingwaz> yo everypony
<ScootaChicken> I leave for a bit and get pingd
<Ingwaz> Gunthler: just buy the toy instead of the meal

<MadxHatter123> Anyone know where I can find the newest episode online? I missed the live stream saturday because I had a drivers-ed class that day.
<flutter_spin> there was no new episode this week
<kenne88> do they just give you anyold one or do you have to ask specifically for a certain set casue i know they usually have a set of boys toys and girls toys and sadly i think thisll be classified as a girls toy
<CCCP> MadxHatter123: on youtube
<Tovler> No new episodes. The show has been put on hiatus due to the derpy incident.
<CCCP> wait really?
<unfoundbug> no
<flutter_spin> I don't believe that
<unfoundbug> new ep next week

<KwakLad> good day Saturn
<pony_8942> ok
<Gunthler> how big of a weirdo am i gonna look like walking into McDonalds and asking for 1 of each of the MLP toys >_>
<Snuffsis> Not at all
<RoseyPony> all the bronies will cheer
<flutter_spin> Someone suggested using the drive-thru
<Snuffsis> Just answer them with "I'm A BRONY!"
<flutter_spin> But I'm totally going in and asking for girls toy
<Gunthler> I'M A BRONY AND I'M PROUD
<flutter_spin> Finding the blind bags at Toys R Us was so totally worth the courage
<Tovler> If you have a straw hat with silly buttons on them, people will just think you're an eccentric toy guy.
<RoseyPony> all you have to say is...."I'm a Brony got a problem with that
<Gunthler> ^
<pony_8942> ugh
<flutter_spin> its going to kill me! Why does that video sound so familiar
<RainbowcrashNBurn> flutter_spin: which one?
<Tovler> Kinda sounds like Mordecai from Regular Show
<pony_8942> oh dont get me started on mordacai
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkWCg3f0KWo that one
<Pinkies4thWall> Thats borderlands talk?
<RoseyPony> all i got to say is......http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5dgyCryWJY
<RainbowcrashNBurn> the chorus is from good ol' days
<Snuffsis> http://i.imgur.com/L2Jg1.jpg
<Silver_Streak> i just read my little dashie for the first time
<RoseyPony> lol nice picture
<RainbowcrashNBurn> well....good ol' days used the chorus from that
<MadxHatter123> I'm gonna go. I want to get some xbox time in. See ya.
<pony_8942> :P
<Silver_Streak> lol yeah
<RoseyPony> xbox is awesome playing right now :)
<flutter_spin> I don't know. the 20% remix just didn't hit me right.
<Silver_Streak> i should jump on too
<Silver_Streak> maybe
<RoseyPony> i'm playing some cod
<pony_8942> xboxis awsome but PS3 is better
<Silver_Streak> meh
<RoseyPony> all the good CoD players use Xbox
<pony_8942> ;P
<pony_8942> :p
<RaveBrony> Im come back to talk off cod???
<Silver_Streak> yay
*RaveBrony leaves again
<Snuffsis> good cod players? haha
<RoseyPony> lol
<unfoundbug> rosey have you ever played the pc version?
<RAWRity> bonjour
<pony_8942> :D
<unfoundbug> console players got nothing on pc players
<RoseyPony> no
<pony_8942> oh cool
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hola RAWRity ~
<pony_8942> D:
<unfoundbug> and yes i have both
<RoseyPony> i have troubles aiming with mice
<pony_8942> nopicture for that
<RaveBrony> PC gamers <3
<CCCP> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/2e9271d16cdbefaf8b34a54acf2b8c51/56350%20-%20derpy_hooves%20duplicate%20liska%20muffin%20sad.jpg
<RAWRity> how goes things, everypony?
<pony_8942> :l
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw0yqTqHXT0 = PC Gamers
<flutter_spin> I played Mass Effect on the xbox and Mass Effect 2 on the PC. I have no problem with mixing the two.
<unfoundbug> i play with my xbox controller on my pc
<unfoundbug> no shame
<pony_8942> :)
<Ingwaz> not sure how you could have trouble aiming with a precision instrument
<pony_8942> :(
<herostar> Snuffsis WHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY ;A;
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mehh~ don't know if i'm sick or just tired ~
<pony_8942> :0
<RoseyPony> don't make me pull out fearcrads now
<pony_8942> :S
<Snuffsis> "That was an improvement, but it's not hard to improve on garbage, try again" always make me laugh
<flutter_spin> Noooooo, where is my backup DAW pic?
<pony_8942> :L
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> same thing unfoundbug yet i'm trying to get better with the mouse ~
<pony_8942> :C
<unfoundbug> i find the controller more natural for shooters
<Silver_Streak> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3055/
<flutter_spin> http://stardustxiii.deviantart.com/art/Gimme-some-284469748 Bad memory gone.
<pony_8942> D;
<RaveBrony> dat link
<pony_8942> damn
<unfoundbug> plus also, its infinately more fun to taunt the people you beat by informing them that your using a controller
<pony_8942> :P
<pony_8942> wow
<RaveBrony> Silver_Steak, beware of such links :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> unfoundbug: thats because you started with consoles, and pc guys like the mouse because the same thing ~
<Silver_Streak> why?
<pony_8942> :O
<flutter_spin> We don't talk about... you know what video here
<unfoundbug> TheGreatAndPowerfulT actually i started on the pc
<pony_8942> hah
<RaveBrony> Thats from a vid/vids that arent allowed in this chat :D
<RoseyPony> xbox controllers are best for shooters to me
<Silver_Streak> which video?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then i don't know ~
<Snuffsis> PC guys like the mouse because of the infinitely better precision.
<unfoundbug> and i usually spend more time on the pc than my xbox
<CCCP> hi pony_8942
<Silver_Streak> shed.mov?
<pony_8942> :D
<pony_8942> hi
<RaveBrony> Yep
<CCCP> Silver_Streak: NO
<RaveBrony> Cant talk/show.or link that in this chat :o
<pony_8942> :O
<unfoundbug> its not actually that much better though, the increased precision is offset by actually having to MOVE the damn thing
<Silver_Streak> I like parts of it. but ok
<CCCP> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pc guys always rage on me because i'm a battle medic, dead ringer spy and i'm using a xbox controller ~
<RaveBrony> Meh, the mods dont like it :P
<pony_8942> :P
<Snuffsis> It's not offset or anything, it's ALOT better, doesn't matter if you have to move it or not.
<unfoundbug> you wanna quickly do a 360, your stuck with your mouse on the other end of your desk
<RaveBrony> And theyre always lurking >.>
<Silver_Streak> :O
<pony_8942> wow
<unfoundbug> TheGreatAndPowerfulT people rage cause your an annoyingly good spy
<Snuffsis> The only good a controller is for, is for comfort. :P
<pony_8942> :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nah ~ i'm not that good ~
<RaveBrony> Yeah :D
<pony_8942> :D
<tymo> Adjusting mouse speed can help achieve 360 spin. No point in having an argument over this. Pc Gamers love their mouse and console players love their controllers. If someone rages, it's just because they're soar losers
<Silver_Streak> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1324/
<unfoundbug> damnit now i wanna play tf2

<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you're gettin Black/White 2 and you'll LIKE IT.

<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEnWvHrfgYE
<fluttercry> 05,15I never really liked pokemon that much. It was alright but I never got obsessed *hides behind flame shield
<RAWRity> um, Silver/Gold was on the Gameboy Color. If you're talking about Heartgold/Soulsilver, those were on the DS.
<PinkiemenaCopy> Prince Dari seems to be a bot
<Cypresswolf> Actually, 28 ponies, 1 griffon, 1 buffalo, & 1 Discord to be exact
<pony_8942> ugh what the
<pony_8942> hell
<RaveBrony> Cypresswolf, youre so lucky you can afford such things....
<CCCP> steal ponies
<tymo40> The gameboy color was compatible with the gameboy advance as well..
<Cypresswolf> I didnt buy them all at once. Been collecting since early July
<RanDT1> Yes it was for the gameboy color.. but it also worked on the advance. not the Ds
<Cypresswolf> not all them are custom
<RoseyPony> well time for me to trek on down to McDonald's :)
<RaveBrony> Well, i have no source of income :'( I can get anything....
<RaveBrony> Have fun RoseyPony!
<RanDT1> RoseyPony: get me something too pweese?
<Tovler> k, back.
<RaveBrony> ^
<tymo40> The games made for gameboy could fit the slot in the back.
<Cypresswolf> several are blindbags I got from hasbro box and toys are us or walmart
<RaveBrony> Wb Tovler :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait...are the pony toys at McDonalds now?
<RoseyPony> heh how much are the toys
<CCCP> brb
<BewareOfBunny> is anything playing
<Gunthler> I would want to hang out with Dashie :L
<RaveBrony> The blind bags are like $3-$4 right?
<Tovler> (dammit. I was wait for the Premium Grey version to come out instead of the incomplete B/W version.)
<BewareOfBunny> or is my comp just not wanting to show anything
<RAWRity> fluttercry: they start next week I believe.
<MirrorImage> no stream
<kenne88> what exactly is a blind bag
<fluttercry> 05,15Damn, I don't have class tomorrow and I was going to hit up every McDonalds in town
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: 2$ at walmarts, 3$+shipping on Toywiz
<MirrorImage> kenne88 - individually packaged pony figures
<MirrorImage> but they aren't labeled except for a small number
<RAWRity> kenne88: it's an opaque bag with 1 MLP figurine.
<RaveBrony> Its a mystery bag with a pony figure inside :P
<Iota> e
<kenne88> oh ok
<Iota> e_e
<RaveBrony> RAWRity, wait... Walmart in the US???
<RaveBrony> o.o
<kenne88> is it determined or completely random?
<MirrorImage> unless you know what those numbers relate to, you don't know what each bag contains
<RaveBrony> *Walmart, as in
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: yes. They've slowly been working their way into walmarts over the past couple months.
<RaveBrony> Holy hell!!
<RanDT1> I'm so gonna go to MC donalds and Demand a kids meal..
<Photon-Phoenix> ...
<RaveBrony> Guess who is going to Walmart tomorrow? :$
<RoseyPony> hmm before i go hhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjIhs72l0Aeres a trip to the rainbow factory.......
<RoseyPony> grr
<fluttercry> 05,15Everyone at my McDonalds is Russian. Random fact
<RoseyPony> silly touchpad
<RAWRity> your local one may or may not have them (mine haven't) but I've been hearing from other places that they're showing up.
<CupcakeWarrior> I cant believe im saying this, but I totally want a happy meal right now :D
<RanDT1> :O!
<Photon-Phoenix> I wonder how creepy it would be to dawn a baggy black hoodie and pants and grab a shitload of MLP blindbags at walmart
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: who DOESN'T want a happy meal?
<Cypresswolf> 4 inch ponies are $5, blind bag box was $56 with tax. no telling how much I spent on customs alone. all but 10 on the shelf are customs, the other store bought ponies are stock piled everywhere else: closet, under the bed, in the corners of thr room...
<RoseyPony> well i'm off for some toys peace
<RAWRity> Photon-Phoenix: I plan on doing just that when they finally get here.
<RanDT1> "Yes I would like a plain cheese burger with Fries... and errm, a kids meal NAOW!
<RaveBrony> well at least I know they hve a Chance at being there, RAWRity, ty! :$
<kenne88> toys come with happy meals too right?
<RAWRity> kenne88: eeyup, that's what makes them happy ;)
<Gunthler> :L
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm going to order the happy meal like a boss. no ordering two meals for me!
<CupcakeWarrior> I would probably buy another meal, so that the cashier thinks I am ordering for more
<CupcakeWarrior> than one person
<fluttercry> 05,15Hell no! Wear your colors CupcakeWarrior
<Gunthler> ^
<Cypresswolf> Derpy Hooves, my first custom was, about $160. I havent seen or heard from the artist since
<CupcakeWarrior> Fine.
<tymo40> Get multiple happy meals! More ponie >)
<RAWRity> If I can walk straight down the aisle at wal-mart once a week and look for MLP blind bags, you can order some greasy food and say you want the girl's toy.
<TrixieMuffin> Hi , 1 happy meal please , ... no the other toy .... no .... just give me the fricken pony already
<MirrorImage> TrixieMuffin - i think they're used to it by now
<Cypresswolf> Ive only seen the blind bags at Toys R Us
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never seen any blind bags
<Gunthler> I'm about to go to McDonald's and just ask for 1 of each of everypony :L
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: they're been slowly coming into wal-marts around the US.
<RaveBrony> I walked down the aisle in Target looking for blind bags and a couple of people gave me "Wtf" looks :D
<RaveBrony> and i didnt mind one bit :$
<RAWRity> Gunthler: I think you can actually do that :o
<Gunthler> xD
<CupcakeWarrior> By the way, what is the best store for ponies?
<fluttercry> 05,15Are you sure, don't they usually only have one toy at a time?
<Gunthler> whats best store for ponies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> two ~
<RaveBrony> Stores in europe :D
<SayWhat> Toys R Us
<tymo40> ^ yep yep
<RAWRity> Like, I'm fairly certain McDonalds DO sell their toys in bulk. IIRC, that's how I got all their Beanie Baby toys years back.
<RaveBrony> Oh yeah :o
<CupcakeWarrior> I have no good stores in my town except Wal Mart
<Zappy> Hi everypony.
<SayWhat> Hi
<Zappy> What's new?
<RoflBot> HIIII
<CrazyBronyDonut> Hi everypony
<RanDT1> Hello Zappy!
<Cypresswolf> :) I have no problem asking for ponies at McDonalds. When the neopets toys invaded a few years back 2005 or 6, I bought every one I could ( I was working night shift at Walmart - Grocery Stocker) I'd buy them on my way out when MD's opened in the morning
<CrazyBronyDonut> no stream today :(
<CupcakeWarrior> Last time I went to toys r us, all I found was Pinkie and that RD toy with the huge butterfly winfs
<Zappy> Hi CrazyBronyDonut.

<RoflBot> watz dat?
<CrazyBronyDonut> they were fun
<SayWhat> You are a thing that tries to kill an alien
<SayWhat> Is the whole premise of the game
<Zappy> Croc? I played Croc and Crash bandicoot when I was little. Fun times...
<Cypresswolf> I havent played in years :) I think I was trading with just about every planet in 1 arm of the galaxy when I got bored with it
<SayWhat> I cheated and went to the middle because the bad guys were OP
<Cypresswolf> Planet full of Ponies!
<unfoundbug> that sounds like a nice place to be
<SayWhat> I'mma make a pony on spore
<Cypresswolf> I never did find Earth in the game

<CrazyBronyDonut> once played WC2 and 3 all the time
<RoflBot> i mean like the strategy type Warcraft
<Zappy> Warcraft 3. I played that game before.
<RoflBot> WC3 rocked
<SayWhat> I'm excited for Borderlands 2 and Guild Wars 2
<CupcakeWarrior> Warcraft was a strategy game?
<Zappy> IKR?
<CrazyBronyDonut> WC3 was amazing
<unfoundbug> uncharted was overrated
<RoflBot> omg
<fluttercry> 05,15LIES

<Zappy> *puts a blanket over sheep Meanwhile*
<Dken2021> but it did awful in box office so it was their own fault

<Meanwhile> Inb4 no controversial topics
<kenne88> religion does not equal fail its people who try to push their religion on other people who fail
<Polydunami> Not in MY BronyState

<Polydunami> Somehow...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's almost like a religion to some.

<RaveBrony> O.o
<Meanwhile> Alas Snuffsis human beings are horrible things.
<Polydunami> The trouble is, people are arrogant greedy bastards
<fluttercry> 05,15Utopia would be boring, because if everything was perfect, we'd have nothing to compare it too
<kenne88> would crap bricks if wrek had all that remains somewhere in setlist
<Polydunami> I know, I'm one of them
<fluttercry> 05,15therefore, it wouldn't be special
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No I prefer communist guns, so I can feed them to Friendship Prime!

<Meanwhile> You know what I need right now?
<CupcakeWarrior> How do you download so fast?
<Snuffsis> We pirates is the only saving grace for your freedom of speech!
<RaveBrony> I want to torrent mlp episodes :(

<CandyBar> 05Dken2021, good luck finding a legal copy of undercover brother then >:C dirtbag
<Dashie_Dashie> RaveBrony, I just did.
<Meanwhile> My little pirates, torrents are magic.
<RaveBrony> I know, lol
<CupcakeWarrior> I can only download at 150kb/s
<Snuffsis> You should welcome the world of Fiber into your life
<Dashie_Dashie> in GLORIOUS 1080p too.
<kenne88> ivdont torrent becuase idk how it works lol that why i mooch off my friends via dropbox

<Polydunami> Oh man, Mint icecream? Jelly
<Snuffsis> I have the option to upgrade to 1gbit down / 100mbit down, but it's too much for me. :P
<CandyBar> 05torrentign isnt too slow CupcakeWarrior, you are.
<kenne88> why torrent when youtube exhists
<Pinkies4thWall> http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6969667/My_Little_Pony__Friendship_is_Magic_Season_2_%281st_Half%29_%5BHD_720p
<RaveBrony> I waaaaas going to legit Buy them off itunes....but after recent events F*squee*k, that
<Polydunami> Oh my
<RoflBot> are you allowed to post that?
<mario_pony> CandyBar: what's wrong with octavia?
<Dashie_Dashie> I don't pay for my entertainmen.
<CupcakeWarrior> Pirating is illegal guys
<Japanda> Everytime you pirate a Pony episode, Derpy hooves sheds a tear behind her bars in Hasbro Prison
<Dashie_Dashie> to hell with that.
<MirrorImage> RaveBrony - that's no reason to not buy the other episodes
<MirrorImage> your gripe is with The Last Roundup - specifically DON'T purchase that episode
<RaveBrony> I know :P
<Dark__Horst> i don't do torrents
<kenne88> how much does it cost per ep
<Pinkies4thWall> It's piracy if you redistribute, right?
<Japanda> it's 3$ an episode
<RaveBrony> Once I get a job ill be sure to actually buy them, just for support :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Just download the eps from youtube
<Tovler> *picks up the Black phone* GET ME UNDERCOVER BROTHER!
<PinkiePieCopy> over 90000 dollars
<RoflBot> just watch it free on youtube
<CandyBar> 05its illegal to upload
<Dken2021> I don't mind pirating for "legitamite reasons" but I don't mind paying
<Japanda> 3$ an episode on Itunes or 30$ for one season
<kenne88> yeah screw that youtube sounds like a better deal
<Phase4> Damnit! firewall here blocks irc
<Dark__Horst> torrents ar elike holding up a huge sign with your ip adress for every sniffer to see
<MirrorImage> CupcakeWarrior - it's less about having them and more about actually supporting Hasbro
<CandyBar> 05not illegal to download
<CandyBar> 05AND
<Japanda> Just download youtube downloader and download the EPS
<RaveBrony> $3/episode
<CandyBar> 05its only illegal to download torrents that contaion ILLEGAL MATERIAL
<Snuffsis> Here in sweden, it's legal if you share your moves and music with friends, so if we all just become great friends, we're safe.
*Polydunami lives in Canada
<CandyBar> 05it is not illegal to download TORRENTS
<Soyuz> sup Zealot?
<RaveBrony> Lol^&
*Phase4 G'day mate
<RoflBot> technically thats true
<Dark__Horst> yeah, but these EPs are being sold
<PinkiePieCopy> Hey RoflBot
<Dark__Horst> downloading them free has to set SOMEONE off
<Japanda> Everytime you PURCHASE a my little pony episode, Derpy Hooves gets 5 minutes of Sunshine :p
<Dken2021> like if you really can't find something at all or there are no copies left, then it's ok with me
<kenne88> is it just me or is stream frozen
<Zealot> nm
<RoflBot> what ?
<Zealot> you?
<Cypresswolf> Is the season 1 dvd already out
<CandyBar> 05besides
*Jim sneezes
<CandyBar> 05once the S2 DVD with english is released here in sweden im getting it
<RaveBrony> Blees you, Jim :$
<Snuffsis> dken2021: Like NES or SNES games and such. :P
<PinkieSpice> did i miss something on the stream?
<RaveBrony> indeed
<Japanda> if 10,000 people buy both season 1 and 2, Derpy hooves will get to leave Hasbro Prison!
<Jim> Thank you ^_^
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait
<Polydunami> Hmm. I could've sworn I was wearing clothes a second ago...
<PinkiePieCopy> PinkiePieCopy:
<PinkiePieCopy> Woot
<CupcakeWarrior> Is emulation illegal?
<RaveBrony> :o
<RoflBot> depends
<Japanda> Emulation is ILLEGAL
<Japanda> jesus CHRIST
<KwakLad2> Good night
<Snuffsis> Personally, i don't even like buying old games redistributed onto steam and such. because the developers of those games don't get any money from those sales. :(
<Yahooz> Goodnight Bronystate, see you guys tomorrow
<Japanda> if you're VIEWING IT/ PLAYING IT for free it's ILLEGAL
<MirrorImage> ...wow, Daytona 500 just got interesting...
<Dken2021> pricing for imports are ridiculous
<MirrorImage> a car just slammed into one of the jet driers
<Polydunami> Virtual Console is legal
<Phase4> Japanda: depends on where you live, if you own the game generaly its legal
<Japanda> Stop trying to get COMPLICATED with it. PIRACY is Piracy
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw Ive broken the law a bunch
<PinkiePieCopy> Playing what for free
<RaveBrony> Correction!! Only illegal....if you get caught ;)
<flutter_spin> ugh. The Brony Show is boring
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03later Yahooz!
<MirrorImage> jet driers as it an airplane jet engine
<otakon> night Yahooz
<Dken2021> nighty night Yahooz
<Dashie_Dashie> Mfw I don't give two shits about government law. :)
<otakon> sleep well
<LadyCanary> Bye Yahooz!
<Snuffsis> Emulation is only illegal if you don't own the game yourself. :P
<Japanda> Phase4: That's different, you own the game
<pinkydash> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 4 days, 15 hours, 7 minutes, 7 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<Jim> bye Yahooz
<RaveBrony> Brb
<Japanda> 4 DAYS WHAT THE HECK
<CandyBar> 05oh hey
<PinkiePieCopy> 4 days
<otakon> Japanda: yeah, but waht about games that you can't get any other way?
<Japanda> I'm going to youtube, SCREW THAT
<PinkiePieCopy> It went from
<PinkiePieCopy> 6 days
<PinkiePieCopy> to FOUR DAYS?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dat time traveling
<Japanda> otakon: Wait for Public Domain
<Nittany_Discord> 11,014 days is better than 10.
<Meanwhile> I'm back, with mint icecream mixed with marshmallows.
<CandyBar> 05i own this copy of warcraft 2, but the CD is old and scratched, I'll download the torrent to play it. tell me Japanda, is that illegal?
<Phase4> Japanda: sure, but you said that emulation was illegal. its not on its own
<CupcakeWarrior> I hope someone leaks the next episode
<mario_pony> somepony invent a time machine quick!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> Japanda: on Dragon Warrior for the GBC?
<Polydunami> ... Nah.
<Japanda> Phase4: I said it was illegal if you got it for free.
<Snuffsis> otakon: when it comes to oldergames it's okay, since, ibelieve that copyright laws on IPs only last up for 10 years or something like that.
<TrixieMuffin> There is something called Abandonware , some old stuff that you can download free because the publisher or whatever no longer wants to support it or something like that.
<Dark__Horst> technically, it would be illegal
<Dark__Horst> very so
<Dken2021> public domain for earthbound? fat chance
<PinkiePieCopy> So...
<Phase4> Japanda: ah, must have misread or missed that.
<PinkiePieCopy> it's illegal getting cracked terraria?
<Japanda> No worries mate PHASE4
<PinkiePieCopy> For free
<Meanwhile> Good grief what've I returned to?
*Tovler waits for iTunes to accidentally upload Putting Your Hoof Down.
<Polydunami> Indeed
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<PinkiePieCopy> Shit
<Snuffsis> Or rather, after a certain amount of time they have to renew the copyright to maintain it.
<Polydunami> Actually, it could happen
<CandyBar> 05to me, if i have payed for a copy of sometihng, im entitled to download it, morally that is
<PinkiePieCopy> I got cracked terraria that never works
*Dken2021 waits for itunes to screw up as well
<Japanda> otakon: you can get dragon warrior on GBC for 250$
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Piracy is piracy, but companies that buy up and sit on IPs are another thing.
<flutter_spin> lol, like the Hobbit?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And abuse their copyrights.
<Dark__Horst> however, selling used games to someone or giving them away for free will never be illegal, no matter what the faggy, user-raping companies will say
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And breach fair use.
<otakon> Japanda: yeah, right.
<Japanda> tHE hOBBIT is not Publi DOMAIN
<CupcakeWarrior> Not paying for things>paying for things
<SilverStreak> what i miss?
<flutter_spin> well they DID have to wait until the Hobbit contract ran out
<Polydunami> Absolutely nothing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hoping that the other side doesn't want to go through the trouble of proving fair use.
<SilverStreak> ok
<Meanwhile> In unrelated news, icecream mixed with marshmallows is the.best.possible.thing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because of one-sided copyright laws.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Is Animal Farm public domain? I know its funded by the CIA
<Snuffsis> What CandyBar said. I also download stuff i've pre-ordered because fuck me having to wait 2 weeks for a game to come out here in Sweden when it's out in the US and the internet already.
<Jim> Sounds yummy Meanwhile
<fluttercry> 05,15What...the...hell is this weird alien in a business suit...
<Japanda> Flutter_shy: Peter Jackson owns the license to the Lord of the Rings franchise
<Polydunami> The Count of Monte Cristo is public domain
<Japanda> flutter_spin: peter Jackson
*mario_pony waits with Dken2021 and Tovler
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: you're watching the one with the soaceman in the lake aren'tcha.
<CupcakeWarrior> Can we talk about ponies now?
<fluttercry> 05,15yup
<Meanwhile> spaceman*
<Japanda> Polydunami: The count of Monte Cristo is Public domain because it was writte by shakespeare LOL
<Polydunami> Umm
<Snuffsis> CupcakeWarrior: are Brittish ponies fine with you? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOi3StWmG7A
<Meanwhile> You'll have to keep watching the series to actually understand what's happening.
<Polydunami> Ever heard of Dumas?
<Dken2021> here's my 2 cents: I say it's ok if it's because you can't afford ridiculous import prices or they just don't make them anymore, but for things like minecraft or games that are like only $15-20? wrong
<fluttercry> 05,15Awesome. So far this is turning out better than I expected
<Phase4> lolwut
<Phase4> sudden quits
<Dark__Horst> btw, is there any schedule to the streaming of the series we started watching here?
<Japanda> Polydunami: Sorry, Dunami
<Phase4> hi LC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heard that companies are/were trying to get things pulled from public domain.
<flutter_spin> Everything should be free :P
<Phase4> bye lc?
<LordCelestia> 0,5No im here
<Polydunami> No no, it's fine
<Jim> ohai LC
<Polydunami> I've made incorrect assumptions myself
<Meanwhile> Allo LC.
<CupcakeWarrior> I SAY!
<Phase4> all these join/parts are confusing me
<Dken2021> lali-ho lord of bacon
<Phase4> hai LordCelestia
<Polydunami> Hello there LordCelestia
<mario_pony> hi LC!
<Japanda> flutter_spin: Let's say you make a movie and you're a poor director. You shouldn't get a cent for your movie?
<CupcakeWarrior> bravo
<Snuffsis> Companies are doing all kind of things to limit the publics access to things. Corporate censorship and all that.
<Tovler> The fact that I would have never bought it with my money is justification for piracy. *pirates Twilight*
<Conyst> hello LordCelestia
<Pinkies4thWall> Speakng of free/ download stuff, is there a graphic EQ i can download for win7?
<Polydunami> :D
<Dark__Horst> the only ones that get hurt by pirqacy are the ones that fail at what they produce
<flutter_spin> Right now I'm fighting Mom for the right to pay my own bills.
*LadyCanary flies over to LordCelestia and nestles in his mane, waiting for a somepony
<Snuffsis> Why would you want to pay your own bills?
<Japanda> Tovler: I would never buy a Ferrari with my money, does that mean I should break into a dealership and steal one?
<CandyBar> 05break it up you two
<RaveBrony> Woah
<Meanwhile> The only things I have that've been pirated are stuff other people gave me.
<Snuffsis> I'd be thrilled if someone else paid my rent
<mario_pony> mmmmmm bacon.....
*CandyBar lifts LadyCanary to the corner and pats her on the head, behave now
<Bluestrom_S> http://equestria.fadri.org/034-offensive/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Companies also want to limit public access so they can profit off of it.
<robokun> bacon?
<Snuffsis> Japanda: No, but you could download it if it was possible? :P
<Gluepop> bacon
<RaveBrony> Ive got to get some sleep everypony!! As always, take care and have fun!! Good night! :$
<LadyCanary> CandyBar: W-what did I do? I always go to LC's mane.
<Japanda> Snuffsis: You can't download cars silly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not just profit off of what normally could be.
<Dark__Horst> companies are greedy hives
<CandyBar> 05you see
<Dken2021> night RaveBrony
<Jim> You wouldn't download a car
<Tovler> If by stealing, you mean "cloning" the ferrari, then yes.
<CandyBar> 05ITS MINE
<CandyBar> 05MIIIIINE
<CandyBar> 05HAHAHA
<Dark__Horst> we shouldn't be surprised by their crap anymor
<Jim> night RaveBrony
<robokun> Bluestrom_S: i lol'd
<Meanwhile> Dat loony laugh.
<Pinkies4thWall> We, right now, are talking about the reasons SOPA and PIPA exist
<Snuffsis> Japanda: don't be so sure of that! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-iJLHZt8M
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Companies are greedy be definition.
*RaveBrony waves 'bye' to everypony!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're not all bad.
<mario_pony> bye RaveBrony
<Meanwhile> You wouldn't download a car...
<Pinkies4thWall> meant the fact that companies want more money
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They have to make money, and they use it to make things better.
<Dark__Horst> tell that to EA and Ubisoft
<Meanwhile> Buck you I would so download a car.
<SilverStreak> i want to download a car
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Can't Sleep~ Hi again everyone ~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I'm not defending EA and Ubisoft.
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile YES"
<Meanwhile> Wb TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Phase4> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Japanda> Snuffsis: That is going to take a couple decades to develop fully. Right now, all it is good for is 3-D Hentai.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those companies want to rule everything you buy.
<Snuffsis> Nittany_Discord: The best stuff comes from the public though, the community surround everything.
<Conyst> hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Tovler> Also, I tend not to steal from small companies. Ferrari is probably a small company despite its rich clientele.
<Polydunami> dat Midna pony
<SilverStreak> yay snuffsis
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs everyone~
<CandyBar> 05I'd download a car
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where can I get a car torrent?
<Meanwhile> I would if I could drive.
<fluttercry> 05,15but would you download a bear?
<Dark__Horst> remember when ubisoft actually published fun games? just that without any of the crap? god i miss those times
<Meanwhile> He's...a bear.
<SilverStreak> CandyBar /)
<Pinkies4thWall> Would you steal a McLaren, when you need to order it before it's even built?
<CupcakeWarrior> Would you download a pony?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<Japanda> PinkiePieCopy: Stop CLOPPING TO PONIES!
<Meanwhile> Yes I would.
<SilverStreak> yah
<Dark__Horst> i still remember things like thandor or hell copter
<CandyBar> 05http://static.themetapicture.com/media/funny-you-wouldnt-download-a-car.jpg
<CandyBar> 05best
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft was fine with me until 2009.
<Snuffsis> Japanda: but that is only an open source version, there is already a real size industrial replicator machine that is already producing parts for cars.
<CandyBar> 05image
<CandyBar> 05EVER
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then they helped seed my hate for game publishers.
<Pinkies4thWall> Tangible? I downloaded my tangible pony yesterday
<Dashie_Dashie> CandyBar, O U.
<Japanda> Snuffsis: Well, that's nifty.
<Tovler> The music industry used to sell CDs with only 3 good songs in them for $20. That was pretty stupid.
<CandyBar> 05Japanda, i clop to whatever the fuck i want
<Dken2021> I don't mind companies making money, but they shouldn't treat their customers like thieves with DRM and signin in online to play the game everytime you want to
<Meanwhile> CandyBar: is it meant to be a white screen?
<Dken2021> that's just cruel
<fluttercry> 05,15Why are we talking about clopping?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft says that the DRM is working, but they've seen a 90% drop in PC sales at the same time since it was introduced.
<Meanwhile> clop clop
<flutter_spin> I wonder - if a pirate gives you pirated goods, are you a pirate?
<Dken2021> ponis have hands?
<Japanda> Snuffsis: You got a point, the cost of the printer and materials are akin to buying a laptop and an internet connection.
<Dark__Horst> the biggest fucking joke is that the only ones effected by DRM are the USERS!
<Pinkies4thWall> CandyBar: if it weren't that way, it wouldn't be clopping
<CupcakeWarrior> CLOPPING PARTY!
<Dark__Horst> the pirates are just fine, they could't give less of a shit
<Conyst> Give me your best piratical arrrr.
<Polydunami> Oh god

<Dark__Horst> the ones who bought games with DRM? well sorry guys, you're fucke

<SilverStreak> yes lol

<Pinkies4thWall> Tovler: I AGREE 500%
<Conyst> I hate pears
<Snuffsis> Nittany_Discord: Isn't that the best irony in the world? And still they wonder why people pirate the game, maybe because they can't play it otherwise?! :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<fluttercry> 05,15Well River...THAT wasn't sexual at all
<flutter_spin> lol Nit. I've seen that before.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I turned down a video card because it came with an Ubisoft game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wasn't going to play something with that DRM in it.
<Tovler> I'd like to spike the Mayor
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> portal gun and everlasting thingy ~
<Polydunami> This is crazy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trCf9eCmIHY
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: She's a screamer.
<kenne88> kay i was gone...i cant rmember but werent we supposed to stream something
<Japanda> Nittany_Discord: DRM is like a dirty prostitute. May be dirty, but you still have sex with her.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then you have the other publishers.
<Japanda> Nittany_Discord: Play the game or quit PC gaming
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile I like how you knew EXACTLY what I was refering to
<MirrorImage> Japanda - no.
<CandyBar> 05rather quit PC gaming than allow DRM in my games
<MirrorImage> no, we don't
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: I'm pretty good with quotes.
<Japanda> aLL my games have DRM
<CandyBar> 05nope.
<Japanda> it's not a problem with ME
<Bluestrom_S> lol CandyBar
<Dark__Horst> i bought anno 2070 recently, didn't know about the drm at the time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good for you.
<CandyBar> 05WRONG
<flutter_spin> The only item I would like is the portal gun
<Japanda> Infact, I LOVE DRM
<CandyBar> 05oblivion didnt have DRM
<MirrorImage> i have explictly refused to purchase Battlefield 3, a game I would have otherwise purchased, specifically because it uses Origin as DRM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good for you.
<Snuffsis> Certain DRMs are fine though.
<Japanda> I mean really
<Dark__Horst> imagine my wrath when i found out that i have only a three install limit
<Bluestrom_S> CandyBar steam = DRM
<MirrorImage> i have explicitly turned down a free copy of Borderlands because it uses SecuROM
<Snuffsis> But the shit that says "You're offline, you can't play this game" is just too much.
<Dashie_Dashie> has no idea what your all talking about
*Dashie_Dashie goes back to watching ponies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> install limit ? what is this i dont even...
<Japanda> Stop downloading Pornography on your computer and you won't have to redownload the game onto a new computer
<Dashie_Dashie> IN HD.
<CandyBar> 05which is why i dont buy games on steam
<kenne88> wait so whats a drm? i might remember if you explain it
<Snuffsis> And that you only have a limited number of installs and shit.
<Pinkies4thWall> wat drm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Snuffsis has it right. Certain DRM I'm fine with.
<RoboGerbil> you know, getting games from torrents dont have drm
<Meanwhile> Hay, listen.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even SecuROM
<MirrorImage> Bluestrom_S, CandyBar, Steam is a "get the eff out of the way" DRM
<fluttercry> 05,15Wrek has Deus Ex HR...doesn't use steam you can't explain that
<flutter_spin> I just ask my cousing "Hey, do you have X game" ; "Sure thing. Here you go."
<MirrorImage> and in all honestly, any DRM it uses is publisher made
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I fucking refuse to buy a game requiring me to be online to play SP.
<Derpy_Hooves> and now time for techno scootaloo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A
<kenne88> oh that ea is infamous for that cause their afraid of getting pirated
<Dark__Horst> DRMs are the publishers own crappy steams
<MirrorImage> you can run the Fallout games without having Steam turned on, offline or otherwise, for example
<Snuffsis> I have lots of games on steam, most are indie games though.
<Pinkies4thWall> What's DRM?
*CK|Asleep doesn't care a wink about Steam as DRM on the grounds that it doesn't interfere with my ability to play my games.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03fluttercry: Wrek never asked for that...
<Polydunami> :D
<CandyBar> 05implying i buy my games and havent gotten them gifted or thorugh comissions
<Dark__Horst> distribution platforms that come with all kinds of needle-dildos for the law abiding user
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Japanda> Polydunami: How much wood can a wood chuck chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck WOOD
<Eulshy> digimon
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall - Digital Rights Management. it's supposed to restrict illegal copies of games
<Snuffsis> DRM = digital Rights management, it's software meant to prevent pirating, but usually ends up screwing over legit customers more.
<Polydunami> 42
<Meanwhile> Wrek pirates ALL the things.
<Japanda> Polydunami: How much DRM can a PC gamer complain about if a Pc gamer could complain about DRM
<MirrorImage> most often by limiting how many times a specific CD or account can install a game
<Eulshy> digimon
<fluttercry> 05,15Wrek, modern day Viking.
<kenne88> only game ive been gifted was nation red
<MirrorImage> so that you can't just download it once and give those files to everyone and their friends
<Pinkies4thWall> so, like how i need the borderlands disk in my xbox to play it?
<Dken2021> I really don't like DRM, it just complicates things
<RoboGerbil> yeh drm only takes the pirates a day to crack, but causes customers to have all kinds of problems
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall - not exactly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i usially pirate stuff to try it out ~ if game is good i'll buy it ~
<MirrorImage> but it's similar
<Polydunami> Umm... I'm not knowledgable in this department
*Pinkies4thWall brinhurt
<kenne88> Pinkies4thWall: yeah you do
<MirrorImage> in that case, only one person can use the game at once for a given CD
<MirrorImage> think of it this way
<Japanda> Dken2021: It doesn't complicate anything. Stop download pornography and you'll be FINE
<Polydunami> umm... 528491?
<MirrorImage> assume you could install Borderlands to your XBOX so you don't need the CD in it
<Snuffsis> Does anyone here remember the Starcraft and Diablo Spawn feature?
<Snuffsis> Damn i miss that
<Meanwhile> Borderlands. whadda piece o' crap.
<Derpy_Hooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgbM5ldws7c&feature=related
<Japanda> Dken2021: ANd any RESPECTABLE pc gamer has atleast a 2mbit constant net connetion.
<MirrorImage> DRM would make it extremely difficult for someone to take your CD and install it on their XBOX as well
<flutter_spin> It kind of is amusing. Can't get into beta? Can't get a demo? Pirate to try it out must be the last option.
<Soyuz> Zealot: Listening to music, wanting to RP an so on
<kenne88> no installing it only makes loads faster and play smoother
<Dark__Horst> i'm looking forward to mass effect 3 and syndicate. why? becasue that's m,y chance to say FUCK YOU to EA for origin. pirate ALL THE GAMES!
<kenne88> you still need the disk
<kenne88> or else you cant play the game
<MirrorImage> or if it didn't make it difficult, it would at least include some way to limit the number of XBOXes you could install the game to
<Tovler> o look, The industry is trying to kill Netflix again. And people wonder why we are pirates.
<Meanwhile> Jesus this topic is lasting a long time.
<Bluestrom_S> well CandyBar what your take on a 50/60 AAA game
<CandyBar> 05need the disk to play a game? even a game oyu legally own? screw that use a crack
<Pinkies4thWall> MirrorImage: installing the game to the consolle makes the game run quieter and faster
<Pinkies4thWall> Still need the disk
<flutter_spin> Netflix was doing good, until... *must. resist. joke*
<Snuffsis> What CandyBar said, use a crack isntead.
<Polydunami> Okay, time to Youtube and other things
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall - i know, that's why i said "assume"
<kenne88> if xbox need disk or no game
<RoboGerbil> I dont think ill get mass effect on release, ill just wait for the complete edition next year
<Japanda> I'm going to End this discussion once and for all. DRM is GOOD,
<Meanwhile> Wrek I was curious, what class do you raid with?
<Nittany_Discord_> 11,01I'd be OK with EA if they didn't use Origin to ban people from playing their games from dumb reasons.
<Japanda> It STOPS piracy
<CandyBar> 05nothign stops piracy
<Japanda> DRM does
<Bluestrom_S> ponies stop piracy
<CandyBar> 05no
<Dashie_Dashie> I used to get game for my xbox for free CandyBar, until they patched it and banned my account until 12/31/9999
<Dken2021> yet prates are still here
<flutter_spin> Hey Nit. Play some more Amnesia.
<CandyBar> 05it turn legit users into pirates
<Snuffsis> Steam does the same thing though. Which is ridiculous
<kenne88> not to mentions ea's customer support is almost nonexhistant
<fluttercry> 05,15Nothing can end piracy. people will always find a way around
<Meanwhile> As far as I can tell DRM adds to piracy because nobody likes jumping through hoops.
<Jim> Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate.
<Pinkies4thWall> Rip all content from the disk, upload it
<Japanda> Pirates are BORN not made
<Dark__Horst> i'd be okay with EA if origin was actually trustworthy and their new networking system for BF3 isn't a pit full of bugs and nasty things
<Snuffsis> It's the same thing as if a store you bought a game at would come to your home and remove all your games from that store. :P
<RoboGerbil> heh EA has no customer support, ever try callign them?
<Japanda> If you had the intention of pirating, it wasn't because of the influence of DRM
<Meanwhile> Japanda was made in lab 40 years ago during the age of chivalry.
<Tovler> hmm, maybe the industry is playing 3D chess. Kill Netflix, cause to people pirate like crazy, bring up SOPA again, pass it due to overwhelming piracy.
<SilverStreak> ponies
<Dark__Horst> i mean really, i almost spent 60 bucks on that crap because i thought "finally battlefield again, gonna be worth it"
<Dark__Horst> MIGHTY GOOD THAT DID ME
<Meanwhile> Japanda is like a time displaced samurai who does not understand your dishonourable pirating ways.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lemme guess. Banned from your game?
<Bluestrom_S> Japanda people will always pirate, but it's the quality of the game that will make it succeful no matter how much it's pirated
<CandyBar> 05guys i get the feelign Japanda is so snowed in with his revelations we should jsut leave him alown
<fluttercry> 05,15Japanda is Samurai Jack
*mario_pony is eating ice cream
<Meanwhile> ^
<CCCP> no stream :(
<Japanda> Bluestrom_S: You got a point
<kenne88> i think we should stream something and stop fighting
<Dark__Horst> not banned. but in won't run without trouble,m even now. MONTHS after the release
<CCCP> wTF is Japanda?
<RoboGerbil> want me to stream something?
<Meanwhile> We should take Bronystate and push it somewhere else!
<Snuffsis> Japanda is somewhat correct: people do pirate because they want things for free. But there are also pirates who do it because they want to prove a point.
<MirrorImage> CCCP - if you need some brief entertainment, turn on your local Fox Affiliate
<Japanda> Japan+Panda
<Dark__Horst> i remmeber the first month
<CandyBar> 05that user saying DRM stops piracy
<MirrorImage> nice fireball in the Daytona 500
<CK|Asleep> DRM doesn't stop pirates. The only thing that stops pirates is to provide service that's more convenient than theirs. >_>
<Bluestrom_S> It's all about the quality of the game Japanda thats whats important
<Tovler> mhmm, I bought Black Dynamite because I pirated the movie and loved it too much.
<Dark__Horst> it was a lucky day when battlefield was merciful enough to let me see the frickn menu
<Japanda> Yeah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I like turtles
<CCCP> MirrorImage: is this a trap?
<Japanda> I bought photoshop for 495$
<Meanwhile> I just want ME3 to be on steam.
<kenne88> mfw i thought stream started when it was really an add:S
<Bluestrom_S> DRM just makes it a hassle for everyone
<Pinkies4thWall> NOPE
<Japanda> got a student Discount
<Pinkies4thWall> CHUCK TESTA
<MirrorImage> nope - ever seen a stock car crash into a jet engine at ~80 miles/hour?
<CandyBar> 05as did I
<Bluestrom_S> it can stop lazy pirates
<CandyBar> 05your point?
<Japanda> The point is
<MirrorImage> put your Fox affiliate on quickly and you'll see the end result
<Meanwhile> I pirated photoshop from a CD. £0.
<Japanda> Buy the Game
<Bluestrom_S> but poeple will still pirate
<CCCP> MirrorImage: no
<flutter_spin> My story? People give me their copies of movies, music, and games. I just take them and continue my merry way. I can't afford stuff on my own, so people are like "But you must play Bioshock. Here's my copy."
<CandyBar> 05AAA titles are overated piece of shit that should have died ages ago
<Japanda> So UNCHARTED 2 is overrated?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Meanwhile> Yes it is.
<Japanda> I bet you all have xbox 360s
<mario_pony> yep
<Japanda> And never even touched a ps3
<Bluestrom_S> I agree Japanda, buy he game if you like the game. If you feel the the develop put alot of work and you like the game then by all means buy it and support it
<Dark__Horst> definately
<kenne88> hey guys i got an idea. How bout we take this argument...And push it somewhere else!
*CK|Asleep doesn't condone piracy but isn't going to berate it either. If publishers refuse to provide convenient services they kinda have it coming.
<Meanwhile> I have a PC. I'm content with it.
<CandyBar> 05i have never owned a console
<Snuffsis> There is only a handful of games that truly are AAA titles, (according to me)
<Bluestrom_S> I see this alot with indie games
<Conyst> yeah but less so than CoD
<mario_pony> i have a PS3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i have an xbox and a pse and my freaking laptop ~
<fluttercry> 05,15Uncharted was not overrated
<Snuffsis> And one of those games is Dark Souls!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ps3*
<CandyBar> 05my PC got hardware worth 3000$
<Japanda> Bluestrom_S: Yeah exactly
<Meanwhile> The last console I owned was a PS2.
<CandyBar> 05does that tell you anything about me?
<fluttercry> 05,15Same here Wrek
<Japanda> Yes it does candy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AAA publishers need to die. I'm tired of how almost all of them are choking the gaming industry.
<Tovler> AAA titles cost the industry money. They often need to sell several million copies in order to turn a profit.
<Snuffsis> CandyBar: you are a Console gamer?

<Meanwhile> Models of ponies.
<CandyBar> 05I built it myself
<Japanda> took me 3 days and 9 cups of coffee
<Japanda> i put sweat into that thing
<Bluestrom_S> no nintendo snes, no sega, shrug...
<CandyBar> 05same here
<CK|Asleep> Worth 3k doesn't mean he spent that much necessarily, yo. :p
<CandyBar> 05we are alike you adn I Japanda, come to your senses.
<SilverStreak> cool
<Meanwhile> You probably shouldn't sweat on electronics. Just sayin.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so Wrek can you give us your pc specs ? just asking ~
<Japanda> There's no greater joy in the world than looking at a machine you made with your own hands :p
<RoboGerbil> I have a PC, Anderoid tablet, xbox360, PS2, Sega Genesis, Amiga 1000, and Odyssey

<Pinkies4thWall> So it's ok if i use your art as my profile pic for face or somthing like that
<flutter_spin> Not really sure. I guess people like the diversity of the PC with the Internet while consoles can seem limiting. I like both really.
<Meanwhile> Also because Call of Duty exists.

<Japanda> MLD could have been better
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We'll see about that..
<CCCP> flutter_spin: in your opion
<Japanda> If the writer wasn't so Amateur at the craft.
<Snuffsis> MLD what's dat?
<Pinkies4thWall> When i get surround sound for my room, it'll most likely be bose
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seems kinda right, still i like it for what it was
<Meanwhile> The Rainbow Factory was sadder, but still had bad dialogue.
<CupcakeWarrior> Thats why I dont usually read fanfics
<CCCP> Snuffsis: the greatest peice of art in human history
<Dken2021> I like the RDP version of rainbow factory
<flutter_spin> Walk by Mom to eat or stay in room. Choices choices.
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh shit I have a paper due in an hour and a half
<fluttercry> 05,15FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<CupcakeWarrior> The writing isnt as good as actual books
<Snuffsis> MLD is Picasso?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03There's cookies and punch by the door!
<MASF123> After I finished reading My Little Dashie. I was astounded...at that moment at time I relized something, I can read.
<CCCP> CupcakeWarrior: i think its better
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> where is that pic of bronystate punching a girl in the face ?
<Pinkies4thWall> PUNCH!
<LadyCanary> :D I liek cookies
<Meanwhile> Snuffsis: MLD is a 'sad' fic that uses every possible cliché in sad writing in order to make you sad. that's all. Don't waste your time with it.
<Japanda> The best Fan fiction I've ever read was one with Malfoy as he tried to do Algebra, It was great.
<MASF123> That is true, Meanwhile
<Snuffsis> Oh, my little dashie?
<flutter_spin> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<CCCP> Snuffsis: dont listen to Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> No, My Little Dumplings.
<MASF123> However, it is a very good story
<CupcakeWarrior> The best fanfiction I read was Spiderses
<SilverStreak> I read that one for the first time today Snuffsis
<Snuffsis> I don't really read fan fic, they're usually horrible, and i don't want to ruin the show for me. :P
<Japanda> female abuse
<Meanwhile> My Little Duckpond.
<Dken2021> fluttercry: and then you sudenly realized that staying on a chatrrom while you have an important deadline on your head was a bad idea

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyway, I am going to bed now. LOOONG day ahead
<LadyCanary> Quack~
<Dashie_Dashie> The greatest fanfic I ever read was when the Ugly Barnicle was so ugly that everybody died.

<kenne88> flutter_spin: lol that image describes exactly what happened to me lastnight
<MASF123> fanfics are terrible
<Japanda> Fanfiction is like the American Economy. 99% are poor, 1% are rich with quality.

<Meanwhile> At the rainbow factory, where your fears and horrors come true...
<CupcakeWarrior> Wrek is observing

<MASF123> There are too many cliches in there I will admit, and over-reacting scenes
<CCCP> MASF123: point out one i dare u
<MASF123> Why?
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh god, more arguing:[
<Tovler> or I should say, 250k a year is not poor
<Wrek|Observing> 05what is it CupcakeWarrior?
<CCCP> Well are there actually any cliches u can think of?
<CupcakeWarrior> I just noticed your name, thats all

<Tovler> I think +320k is the 1%
<fluttercry> 05,15WOO HOO
<Japanda> You said 720K
<mario_pony> flutter_spin: what did u write about?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ctrl+c ctrl + v ~
<Dken2021> oh was it that paper you were talking about the other day?
<Tovler> nnnn, no I did not
<SilverStreak> fluttercry i love doing that

<flutter_spin> don't worry, I get that a lot
<Dken2021> oh no! what will you do in that huge amount of time?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol dat stream ~
<Meanwhile> Actually yeah 10 hours is ages.
<CCCP> Dashie_Dashie: AHH u are part of the illuminati!
<Meanwhile> You're only really 'sposed to sleep for like, 7 or 8 hours anyway.
<fluttercry> 05,15Budget cuts in my county. A bunch of teaching jobs are going to get cut plus band programs. And when I was in school band was my favorite thing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dashie_Dashie: i see 4 chan over there ~
<MASF123> Eeyup
<Dashie_Dashie> eeyup.
<CupcakeWarrior> fluttercry: that sucks
<flutter_spin> Don't remind me of homework. I remember waking up at 4AM and finishing an essay before it was due a noon. I used every minute on that thing.
<CCCP> at least hes not on /b/ like me
<Meanwhile> 4Chan. Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy...
<CCCP> I <3 4CHAN
<Conyst> very true
<Dken2021> they were gonna cut band at my high school once, still not sure if they are at this moment
<Dashie_Dashie> until you visit /mlp/
<Meanwhile> Point proven.
<MASF123> I hatez 4chan
<CCCP> Meanwhile: u hate me :'(
<Meanwhile> I do.
<Meanwhile> I really do.
<CCCP> :'(
<MASF123> He does
<Japanda> I just DID 5 HOURS OF CALCULUS
<CupcakeWarrior> 4chan has a pony board? *facehoof*
<Conyst> I once went on 4chan
<Tovler> "Oh no, the school board is going to cut programs for the disabled. I'm going to complain about a clumsy pegasus on a cartoon show."
<Pinkies4thWall> I hate 4chan
<Meanwhile> So much it makes me want to walk out onto the sidewalk and PISS BLOOOOOOD
<Japanda> I've got 2 bottles of mountain dew flowing through MY VEINS
<flutter_spin> ugh. I slept through my Calculus.
<Dken2021> 4chan been hada pony board
<Japanda> lol
<flutter_spin> It was so easy
<Conyst> completely failed my sanity roll.
<CCCP> Meanwhile: i hate u too
<Dumorimasoddaa> 4chan is my childhood
<Japanda> All math is Easy

<Japanda> Teachers just teach it WRONG
<CCCP> </3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The DOW is up, but so is gas, and my parents are fighting to make ends meet (when I can't). Isn't this country great?
<MASF123> CCCP, that's just plin mean. :[
<Meanwhile> "All math is easy" gtfo.
<flutter_spin> I still got a C because it was a 4 quarter test grades only
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Japanda: i have coffee isntead of blood ~
<Japanda> if teachers actually taught math in a good way, everybody would learn it.
<CCCP> I Hate you too MASF123
<Meanwhile> I don't even like math.
<Japanda> It's not the students fault that they fail at Math
<Dken2021> Japanda: replace that with english paper with me and rplace mountain dew with starbucks
<CupcakeWarrior> 0_0 My tv just mentioned flank steak
<Japanda> LOL dken
<Meanwhile> Japanda: sure it is. Their fault for being mentally incapable.
<MASF123> CCCP is a parasprite
<flutter_spin> Some days in math, I taught the class when we had a sub
<CCCP> im not a troll
<Japanda> Meanwhile: Not necessarily
<MASF123> You refuse to love and tolerate
<Japanda> Teachers try to make math seem like it's just white paper and memorization
<Dken2021> yea, math is one of those things you can't teach that well
<Randomnerd> Mmm Mountain due.
<MASF123> I didn't mean troll
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Math was so slowly taught for me. Spent too much time on Arithmetic, which is bleh.
<Japanda> When in reality math is nothing like that.
<Randomnerd> Mountain Dew, even, lol
<Meanwhile> Math is numbers. Go figure.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't like math until I got to Algebra.
<Japanda> They teach it that way because of the messed up school system
<Snuffsis> Japanda: Math is just repetition and remembering the various laws it has.
<CK|Asleep> <Japanda> Teachers just teach it WRONG <----- Hi, high school math teacher here. Care to correct your blatant falsehood?
<Snuffsis> Nothing more
<Japanda> Math isn't repetition
<Dken2021> it's easyy when you execute it, but I have no clue how to explain it
<flutter_spin> I just found the lack of math application in real life situations.. boring
<Wrek|Observing> 05go get him CK!
<Japanda> Well, it isn't ALL repetition
<Pinkies4thWall> lifeblood of the gamer: MOUNTAIN DEW
<Tovler> The school system is here to give student cheap As. not teach children.
<Randomnerd> ^
<Zealot> aherpity derp
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey everyone
<Japanda> Math is about asking a question, finding an answer, and then getting more questions from that answer.
<CCCP> I HATE every one on this life less planet. Every one is deep down evil (driven by greed) including me, Nothing in life is worth living at all
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai Saxy
<Dken2021> lali-h osaxy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai SaxyPretender ~
<Meanwhile> Allo Saxy.
<CK|Asleep> Of course it's not all repetition. But that's the method that tends to get it through to the majority.
<Tovler> ooo, ^ interception
<Conyst> hello Saxy
<flutter_spin> Hey I could totally figure out the length of this ... in 30minutes... or I could get a measuring tape
*Randomnerd is drinking Mountain Dew as he types
<RoboGerbil> Yay i haz invader zim
<Meanwhile> Math is hardly philosophy.
<LadyCanary> Dat SaxyPretender. Tron.
<Japanda> Every single equation in Math was derived from one simple thought that led to branches of Mathematics.
<Randomnerd> CCCP I know that feeling.
<Snuffsis> Japanda: Yes, but learning how to do the math is repetition, learning how to do the calculations.
<Japanda> Snuffsis: there is repetition in every skill you learn
<CCCP> Happines is just an illusion
<Randomnerd> Why else would I watch a show about brightly coloured horsies?
<Japanda> Snuffsis: In english you must memorize grammatical rules
<MASF123> CCCP is right
<Pinkies4thWall> me once filled a camelbak with mountain dew at a gas station
<CK|Asleep> See I hate this new-age trash that math can be taught through scrying and whatnot. Kill-and-drill is not inherently evil.
<CK|Asleep> It just needs to be done properly.
<flutter_spin> Science was boring too. My school was having walkouts with the new principal. The teachers made up our grades as we played games in class
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Chat seems...interesting.
<Meanwhile> In philosophy you must write an awful lot about nothing.
<Japanda> Math is only boring because teachers make it boring
<CCCP> i try to be happy i really do but at the end of the day every thing still just sucks
<Meanwhile> Oh yes because math can be buckets of fun.
<Japanda> If every student thought math was fun, There'd be no pizza men or prostitutes
<mario_pony> there is nothing streaming right?
<Randomnerd> Mountain Dew, Pedagogy and Existential Crisises
<Japanda> We need those people in Society.
<Dken2021> I love math
<MASF123> You don't try at all, CCCP
<flutter_spin> Liet Dan. I'm not kidding. Our teacher was a Liet... first name Dan
*Tovler loves adult themed chats
<Dark__Horst> nope, streams off
<Meanwhile> Very rare are the people who sit down and think math is enjoyable.
<kenne88> doesnt seem like anything is going on so im going to go do something else
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'll be honest, I don't like math much
<Dark__Horst> anyone wanna chaaaange that? *looks around*
<CK|Asleep> Japanda: I'm hearing a lot of nice words but you haven't offered a good explanation how your new-fangled "fun" would work in a classroom.
<Tovler> I mean mature chats *stupid euphamisms*
<CCCP> MASF123: actually u are right i dont
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but Matrix Algebra seems cool
<Pinkies4thWall> Walkeed into gas station, filled camelbak with 100 ounces of mountain dew, paid$1.65
<Meanwhile> Because math is dull as buck.
<MASF123> Haha
<Japanda> It's only rare because it's RARE to find a teacher who maes math FUN
<Meanwhile> LEARNING IS FUN KIDS
<Japanda> Math can be fun because it's really like a Game.
<CK|Asleep> Again, you haven't explained how.
<Randomnerd> I respect Mathematicians, hell, it's hard as fuck to do math.
<Tovler> Math is fun. It's like solving brain teasers
<Meanwhile> I didn't go to school because it was fun.
<Pinkies4thWall> BEST CAFEINE HIGH EVER
<Dken2021> sure math can be dull, but it's the only subject that I do good in
<Japanda> Think of Sudoku or a cross word Puzzle
<MASF123> Learning sucks
<CK|Asleep> You just keep saying that and hoping repetition makes it stick.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I aced algebra 2 - intro to discrete theory.
<mario_pony> wasn't the U.S the first in education in like the 70's?
<Japanda> You use a set of rules and you find an answer to it.
<Japanda> that's what math is
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I hated Calc ;___;
<SaxyPretender> 0,14with a burning passion
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
<Japanda> it's just like Baseball or HALO 3 and whatnot
<flutter_spin> lol
<Meanwhile> I hated math. And English. And everything else.
<CK|Asleep> HOW do you make it fun? If you can't offer ways to make it fun, you're just spouting off the same new-age garbage they try to force-feed new teachers in college.
<Japanda> You have a basic set of rules and you use them to solve the problem in front of you
<Dark__Horst> we call it discrete structure... my god, the horror
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Oh God
<Japanda> It's not New-aged GARBAGE, the fun is in what I am saying
<Meanwhile> Still did better than most of the pond slime you find in secondary school.
<Dark__Horst> *structures
<MASF123> I like Lunch, it was my favorite class.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Discrete Mathematics
<flutter_spin> I was never a reader. I hated English. The Iliad? Where are my Spark Notes.
<Meanwhile> Japanda: it's garbage. Just saying.
<otakon> Guys, I got to go, someone apparently broke into my sister's house.
*SaxyPretender goes into Vietnam Flashback mode
<CK|Asleep> No, you haven't said much of anything, really.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fucking piece of shit PC crashing for the fucking nth time!
<Japanda> Lol
<Japanda> Wel.
<Japanda> We need pizza men in society
<Meanwhile> otakon: get going. Hope alls well. See you round
<Pinkies4thWall> once took a 32 ounce water bottle to ihop; kept pouring my mountain dew into it and asking for refills
<CCCP> come to think of it i will never be happy ever in my entire life. Ponies do not make me happy they make life tolerable
<Dumorimasoddaa> Maths, philosophy, pysics, computing and logic they where my bitches in education
<Japanda> So maybe it's for the best that math is boring
<CK|Asleep> You just keep insisting it can be fun but haven't explained HOW you make it that way.
<CK|Asleep> Which leads me to believe that you have no clue how to make it fun.
<Japanda> I just explained it to you
<Dumorimasoddaa> I learnt calculus in one lesson
<Meanwhile> Math can buck off.
<Snuffsis> All i saw was a load of rambling about sudoku and such, not how to make math fun.
<Japanda> The fun is in using a set of rules and applying them in solving a problem
<mario_pony> i'm failing algebra
<CK|Asleep> Which makes you identical to my professors in college. Spouting off a lot of nice ideas but no substance.
<CCCP> Im failing school
<Dumorimasoddaa> I got As in philosophy writing 20% of what my class mates did
<MASF123> Math sucks
<Meanwhile> Japanda: you have a robot's idea of fun.
<Japanda> lol
<CCCP> Life sucks
<Japanda> I'm not a ROBOT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Beep boop son
<Japanda> math is FUN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14beep boop
<Japanda> trust ME GUYS
<MASF123> That too, CCCP
<Meanwhile> And now Japanda is a robot.
<CK|Asleep> Ideas are great, but what matters is putting it into practice.
<CK|Asleep> Methods.
<Pinkies4thWall> ALWAYS TAKE A HIGH VOLUME WATER BOTTLE TO A RESTAURATNT
<Japanda> I use to hate math too!
<Japanda> ut then I saw it in a NEW LIGHT
<Japanda> and now I have a 97 in calculus.
<Snuffsis> Also, quite honestly, a subject like math sohuld have to be "fun" for someone to learn it, people should just get their asses to the classroom and learn it.
<Dark__Horst> GUYS GUYS GUYS! you should watch this
<Dark__Horst> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI&list=FLfoIzLWoeuz-u2bui2wZORw&index=4&feature=plpp_video

<MASF123> I care about some people that have died
<Meanwhile> flutter_spin2: here FOREVER
<MASF123> Not all...just some
<CK|Asleep> I love math. That's why I took enough of it to earn a mathematics minor in my Bachelors, then went back for a Masters to TEACH it. Can't say I'm too thrilled that not only is some random dude saying I'm teaching math "wrong" (without having watched my class) but also seems convinced he's discovered something new about teaching, in fact it's been passed down by college profs for decades.
<otakon> Nvm
<CK|Asleep> :p
<CCCP> I care about nothing and hope i die some day
<flutter_spin2> I'll figure out the nick issue later.
<CCCP> soon

<Dark__Horst> effin serious
<DeadpoolDash> so tired
<Snuffsis> The only thing i can see that a math teacher can do to make math fun, is to actually be a fun guy himself, and show that he loves it.
<mario_pony> otakon: is your sis okay?
<Meanwhile> I think they were kinda split on the subject.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14agreed, Snuffsis
<CK|Asleep> Now, you wanna know what would *really* help with teaching math?
<Pinkies4thWall> flutter_spin2: logout of all bronystate windows, then log back in as flutter_spin
<flutter_spin2> k
<Meanwhile> Calculators?
<MASF123> CK, is that your current occupation as of now?
<CK|Asleep> If my kids would sit down, shut up, and pay attention. You get them to that point and I can get them to learn. :p

<CK|Asleep> We need to bring back the switch, that's what we need. ;)
<Randomnerd> Bahaha.

<CK|Asleep> I can tell you this: I've seen attempts to make math fun. The kids HATE IT.
<flutter_spin> restarting chrome worked
<Japanda> Once you learn the material, follow a strict set of rules and apply your knowledge to an equation. And you get an accurate answer from a set of steps, YOu are the boss YOU ARE
<MASF123> SIT DOWN AND STUDY!!!
<Pinkies4thWall> *yay*
<CK|Asleep> Because it's just the same mathematics disguised as a game.
*MASF123 smacks student
<Randomnerd> CK|Asleep: Because they know they're being talked down to
<Meanwhile> Japanda: wow that sounds positively ecstatic.
<Japanda> Numbers are beautiful because they are one of the few things in the universe that are absolute.
<flutter_spin> My teachers both loved and hated how different I was from the rest of the class.
<CK|Asleep> Randomnerd: Precisely.
<Dark__Horst> if you want them to learn math, get someone else to teach it to them. someone that ain't a teacher, yet stills knows about it. i, for once, got extra-lessons from my cousin for a time. really helped me back then
<Japanda> There's no greater joy in the world than having complete trust in something as precise as Math
<DeadpoolDash> looks like the steam sync issue is fixed now
<Meanwhile> Personally my approach to fun is the same as it was in school, ignore everything in the classroom and go kick around outside.
<Dken2021> is it now DeadpoolDash ?
<Meanwhile> Japanda: you sound like a preacher for the religion of math.
<DeadpoolDash> yes it is for me
<Japanda> What got me Interested in math was I read some of Einstein's Theories.
<Randomnerd> Japanda: See, that's what I usually put up with -there's no certainty in History.
<flutter_spin> When I told my teacher that I didn't know how to fold a paper airplane, she told me to look it up online. I had the most interesting plane in the class, but that isn't what she wanted me to do.
<MASF123> Math isn't fun. I am decent at the basic algebra, though
<Tovler> mmm. Math doesn't "click" with everybody.
<Japanda> Reyes RANDOM NERD!
<CK|Asleep> I teach in a very collegiate style, myself, and while some kids don't like it, they always ask for help, the ones who care usually do well, and most of the kids leave my class liking me rather than hating me. That tells me I did *something* right, considering I'm probably one of the harshest graders in my school.
<Japanda> yes*
<LadyCanary> I am terrible at math D:
<Dark__Horst> can we talk about more fun things than math? like bloody murder and natural disasters?
<LadyCanary> But I know what I'm good at.
<Dken2021> math was simple for me to do, that's why i love it
<Meanwhile> Dark__Horst: Ikr.
<Randomnerd> English: Well, at least there's s such a thing as proper grammar.
<fluttercry> 05,15Minimum 2 pages and 5 citations? Turn in 2 pages and 5 citations
<Meanwhile> I'd honestly rather discuss the finest points of the fic that must not be named than talk about math.
<Dken2021> I don't like writing papers
*Pinkies4thWall won the science fair in 4th grade using paper airplanes as his topic
<flutter_spin> I was bad at English. I didn't speak until I was 5.
<Japanda> Randomnerd: That's precisely what I mean! History is unreliable and biased. Math is absolute and always right everytime. In history, there are bad facts and lost documents. In math, there are only bad mathematicians, there is no bad Math. Unlike History
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ikr, fluttercry?
<Dark__Horst> i learned english by not giving a fuck and reading english stuff. games to
<Pinkies4thWall> I started reading when i was 4
<Dken2021> english was fine, I just don't like writing papers
<Meanwhile> Japanda: so marry math already.
<fluttercry> 05,15Hey I'm trying to be a History teacher. Don't bash my subject!
<Conyst> I say we talk about Cthulhu
<Pinkies4thWall> Taught myself
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<flutter_spin> You being a teacher? really?
<Dark__Horst> i don't think about grammar or rules, i say what looks or sounds english
<Dashie_Dashie> fluttercry I wub history :3
<CK|Asleep> But whenever I've seen teachers try "fun" and "games", the reaction is mixed. It occasionally works but more often than not, they see the math and don't want to play the game. It stops being fun to them when they see the learning involved.
<fluttercry> 05,15eeyup
<Meanwhile> I saw WE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE EVER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
<MASF123> I suck at English...I have a 87% which is like a B+ but still

<SaxyPretender> 0,14we did that already
<fluttercry> 05,15GO

<MASF123> Didn't
*LadyCanary digs giant robots.
<Meanwhile> It's morphin' time.
<herp-a-derp> best teaching strategy, want all the kids to pay attention in class? hand out a bag a weed
<fluttercry> 05,15Sure why not
<Pinkies4thWall> GO GO POWER RANGERS
<MASF123> Weed
<Pinkies4thWall> GO GO POWER RANGERS
*Zealot derp
<LadyCanary> Gokai CHANGE!
<Snuffsis> I had a teacher try to connect the math subject with street lingo in a class (because they were "Gangstah" ) and they still didn't learn anything, he just looked ridiculous
<Dark__Horst> GOOD LORD, WE NEED A STREAM IN HERE BEFORE WE START SLAUGHTERING EACH OTHER
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Power Rangers In Space!

<fluttercry> 05,15My teaching strategy will be STFO or GTFO as I hope to be at the college level, and they're the ones paying for the classes
<Japanda> He sees the world in numbers, he paints with equations. He colors with theories.
<LadyCanary> Ya gotta find first gear, in your giant robot car
<CK|Asleep> Good. Because none can stand up to Tadakatsu Honda and his DRILL LANCE.
<mario_pony> um otakon
<flutter_spin> When I got a PS2, mom bought me Gundam. She bought me a random game with giant robots.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is the best topic derail ever
<CK|Asleep> ....except Oda Nobunaga, but that's minor details
<Conyst> you dig giant robots
<MASF123> I hate Jersey people they are unedumicated
<Dken2021> the cool teachers to me were the ones that didn't give you all that bullshit about school rules and stuff
<fluttercry> 05,15Anyone ever play Zone of the Enders?
<MASF123> Lol.
<flutter_spin> Yes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I wish I played ZOE
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: once. Many years ago.
<flutter_spin> Zone of the Enders was awesome.
<otakon> yh mario_pony
<Dken2021> fluttercry: i played it once
<otakon> I'm still here
<mario_pony> otakon: is your sis okay?
<CK|Asleep> Kind of cheating to compare anypony with the Devil King of the Sixth Heaven. >.>
<Snuffsis> This is the drill that will pierce the heavens!
<fluttercry> 05,15I freaking loved that game. But it was REALLY short
<Dken2021> and only once
<Dark__Horst> hey guys guys guys! let'S talk about this here
<Dark__Horst> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ4OeBgI8kw&feature=autoplay&list=FLfoIzLWoeuz-u2bui2wZORw&lf=plpp_video&playnext=1
<otakon> SaxyPretender: it was hard but good
<flutter_spin> Shooting a hundred missiles at enemies = awesome
<Snuffsis> Who the hell do you think i am?!
<MASF123> IDK about that game
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Kojima-san doesn't need to make another Metal Gear
<SaxyPretender> 0,14He DOES need to make another ZOE
<otakon> mario_pony: she's okay, but alot of stuff got stolen from her house.
<Meanwhile> I liked Metal Gear Solid.
<mario_pony> otakon: like what?
<fluttercry> 05,15LIQUID!?
<Dark__Horst> i like battlefield
<Dken2021> oh my, hope she's alright otakon
<Meanwhile> METAL GEAR.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I have RL reasons for despising Liquid Snake.
<Tovler> we're in a recession. the videogame industry can only make sequels
<Meanwhile> Does he look like your ex Saxy?
<Japanda> My Geometry teacher told me something I'll never forget " The best mathematicians are self taught. For one cannot truly be a mathematician unless one has the tenacity to seek knowledge outside of Academics"
*MASF123 leaves
<otakon> mario_pony: some jewelry, their saved money, her boyfriend's father's gun.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...more like my ex is left me for someone who cosplays as Liquid
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...which is funny
<otakon> Dken2021: she's okay, just shaken by it.
<Meanwhile> Harsh.
<flutter_spin> http://www.shacknews.com/article/72576/zone-of-the-enders-hd-includes-2nd-runner-se I thought I heard something about HD version
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because she cosplays as Ocelot
<CK|Asleep> Tovler: LIES!
<mario_pony> otakon: oh man
<Meanwhile> Huh.
<CK|Asleep> Oh wait, that's actually pretty accurate.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...and I suppose the ship of those two would be...Liquid Ocelot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14DOHOHOHO
<LadyCanary> Saxyyy
<CK|Asleep> Liquid Ocelot....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, that sucks, otakon, hope everything goes well
<Meanwhile> Liquid Ocelot. Cannot unsee.
<CK|Asleep> That sounds like something that, as a kitten, I should be offended about.
<mario_pony> otakon: how come your mom didn't want you to go?
<otakon> SaxyPretender: me too man.
<otakon> mario_pony: I don't know, I asked her if I should go and she said no.
<Japanda> #SaveDerpy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14In any case, my ex turned out to be a dumb <insert expletive here> and I'm better off, I think
<LadyCanary> I think so too Saxy.
<CK|Asleep> Saxy: That seems to be the norm
<Meanwhile> That's thinking positive.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14DISREGARD SADNESS, ACQUIRE HAPPINESS
<Tovler> It's partially true. The videogame needs to start making more "Free"-to-play if they want to survive. or stop making risky/Epic games
<LadyCanary> There are better people out there for a wonderful person such as yourself.
<flutter_spin> I expected someone to react to my ZoE HD. Oh well.
<Dken2021> risky? the industry? lol
<Japanda> I already beat ZOE
<CK|Asleep> But not for me. :p
<Japanda> Why would I buy it in HD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I should get the ZOE HD Collection
<Meanwhile> The brief delay in when I can look at your text and actually read it SaxyPretender just led me to believe that said "VICTORY FOR SOVNGAARDE"
<Japanda> Sony isn't receiving a DIME of my MONEY
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Japanda> I've already spent 500$ on a Black Doorstop :\
<Japanda> Sorry, Blu ray player
<mario_pony> how come girls are so mean my mom just told me a couple of girls beat up my cuz
<CK|Asleep> Oh, you bought the PS3? lol.
<Japanda> Yeah
<Japanda> I pc Game though
<Snuffsis> I paid 1 sek for my PS3, suck it
<Tovler> Nintendo's was only one that was making money.
<Japanda> MGS4 and Uncharted 2 were AMAZING
<Japanda> but after that, the ps3 was a LACKIN'
<Meanwhile> PS3 was born lacking.
<Japanda> so I PC-GAMED Cause AH-LACK IT lack dat!
<CK|Asleep> I bought myself a Wii. Still don't regret that decision, either.
<Dken2021> girls are like pack of wolves man
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liek wolves
*LadyCanary growls.
<Japanda> I have a WII
*Meanwhile rolls fluffily over LadyCanary.
<CK|Asleep> I can tie myself over with some Zelda and whatnot.
<Japanda> It's covered in dust
<LadyCanary> ./////.
<Japanda> But it has less dust than my PS3
<CK|Asleep> Also, Sengoku Basara 3 is on the Wii.
*LadyCanary howls.
<Japanda> and the ps3 has faaar less dust than my 360
*Pinkies4thWall is selling his wii soon
*Meanwhile baas.
<Snuffsis> Xenoblade man, xenoblade!
<LadyCanary> CK|Asleep: Dat Masamune <3 <3 <3
<Dark__Horst> an i'm still busy wrapping my head around the fact that spike and mayor mare are voiced by the FRICCKIN SAME PERSON!
*Pinkies4thWall is also selling SSBB
<Tovler> And this might not be true anymore more. That Wii U looks expensive and nintendo knows they can't sell it for even 400 dollars
<CK|Asleep> HAVE A PARTY.
<Japanda> My 360 is so Useless.
<Snuffsis> And The Last Story
*CK|Asleep hops on his motorcycle horse.
<LadyCanary> XD
<mario_pony> they said he was just going home then they started pushing him then they triped him and then kicked him
<Pinkies4thWall> 360 is best console
<LadyCanary> My horse is a motorcycle. YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
<Japanda> Pinkies4thWall: If you don't own a pc
*Meanwhile shrugsheep.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...mfw I imagined

<Japanda> Whenever I'm in need of a laugh, I just put in TEAM FORTRESS 2 on my xbox 360. The joke is that it still has no DLC LOOL
<LadyCanary> Sheeepy sheep~
<mario_pony> i hope they catchthem
<LadyCanary> That reminds me...I need to help my friend with her Catherine cosplay.
<Japanda> LadyCanary: That's super hot.

*LadyCanary screams in frustration
<Meanwhile> You are now terrified of sheep.
<mario_pony> LadyCanary: show us her in it after your done
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've always thought sheep were evil
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's in their eyes man
<Pinkies4thWall> just because it's a console game doesn't mean it HAS to have DLC
<LadyCanary> Some of the sheep are helpful.

<mario_pony> Pinkies4thWall:
<Snuffsis> Says the guy who loved math...
<Japanda> Lol, It was a joke
<CK|Asleep> The American system SUCKS, and this is coming from someone capable of doing the conversions. Base ten systems are MUCH better.
<Meanwhile> WE HAD THAT BUCKING CONVERSATION FOR A JOKE?
<Japanda> I was being a typical Americano
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The NWS sites are down and it's windy outside. Did the weather declare war on us or something?
<Japanda> NO

<Meanwhile> Math still blows a giant 4 headed goat but still.
<CK|Asleep> Pft. Base eight.
<Japanda> But I've got a Boner for MATH
<Dumorimasoddaa> But pint sounds better that 531ml
<CK|Asleep> What rot.
<CK|Asleep> Base two is best base.
<Snuffsis> Base 1 is best
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Third base is best base

<mario_pony> math gives me a major brainer

<Japanda> LOL
<AngryCanary> ....
<AngryCanary> Oh mai.
<CK|Asleep> Because base two has the best jokes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...and it's fitting I say that
<CK|Asleep> Like:
<Dumorimasoddaa> Base 35
<Snuffsis> You're out!
<Japanda> I could do MATH ALL day dude
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because I'm listening to a very saxy song

<Japanda> When I'm not cloppin' to ponies I'm droppin' Implicit derivatives
<AngryCanary> ?
<CK|Asleep> See? Base two confirmed for best base.
<AngryCanary> What are you talkin bout mario_pony?
<Snuffsis> CK, do you use a binary watch?
<Snuffsis> binaryr watch is best watch http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/ledbinarywatch-blue2.jpg
<mario_pony> buck i get confused
<Meanwhile> I'll stick to a watch I can read.
<Japanda> LOL
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...wow, I kinda wanna get that binary watch
<mario_pony> somepony told me that their friend wrote a mlp fanfic full of gore
<Japanda> I have a watch that has mathematical equations that tell you the TIME
<Randomnerd> Groan...
<Meanwhile> That sounds incredibly nerdy.
<Japanda> For instance, 3:14 is a PI symbol

<Meanwhile> I wasn't looking, why is canary angry?
<Garrus> that metaphor went somewhere horrible
<CK|Asleep> That watch is sweet
<mario_pony> Garrus: no is cuz Dken2021 asked were there were nerds so i raised my hand
<CK|Asleep> At one point in time I probably could've built one. :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not sure, Meanwhile
<Conyst> I so want to watch that movie
<Snuffsis> It's probably not that hard though, is it?
<Japanda> Lol.
<mario_pony> Meanwhile: she is helping a friend with a cosplay costume
<Meanwhile> Ah.
<Japanda> What's the probability that her friend will be hot enough to give me a stiffy?
<Garrus> BRB gotta do some quick calibrations.
<mario_pony> Japanda: 100%
<Meanwhile> I recall the costumes from Blizzcon, hard work to do that stuff right.
<CK|Asleep> Not really, Snuffsis. It's pretty simple.
<Japanda> mario_pony: Sounds legit
<Snuffsis> Japanda: Very basic statistic would say that it's 50/50. Either she is, or she isn't.
<Snuffsis> :P
<CK|Asleep> I just don't have the parts or software here.
<mario_pony> lol
<CK|Asleep> But a simple microcontroller could do that pretty easily.
<Garrus> So is anyone here going to try to make it to brony-con?
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw that tiny man in the Knights of Badassdom trailer is from Game of Thrones.
<Japanda> Snuffsis: Ohhh yeah ;)
<Dashie_Dashie> *Squee*
<MirrorImage> Garrus - i would if i would have vacation days at work for it
<Silver_Streak> I say make a second brony con in southern utah
<mario_pony> Garrus: i wish but i can't drive and i have no money
<Snuffsis> CK: Yea, i'm probably going to try and make a watch like that, or just buy one. :P
<Silver_Streak> Be good for our ecconomy
<Silver_Streak> and also be easier to get to :P
<Dken2021> I say we make a bronycon in alabama
<mario_pony> Silver_Streak: wait what happened to SilverStreak?
<Japanda> Snuffsis: ut you're forgetting something Snuff
<Dken2021> because why not?
<CK|Asleep> It's not too hard to learn. The big problem would be parts and software. You'd need a way to program microcontrollers.
<Silver_Streak> alabama is too close to new york
<Silver_Streak> i say make one on the west
<CK|Asleep> And the hardware/software for that isn't really that cheap.
<Japanda> Snuffsis: That statistic depends on how desperate I am :D
<Silver_Streak> mario_pony i have two. one for comp one for laptop
<Snuffsis> CK: Pft, just open notepad and make your own software. :rolleyes:
<Dark__Horst> that looks like a very interesting movie
<Japanda> You need more than NOTEPAD lol
<Meanwhile> Look away from the chat for 2 minutes and I've already lost track.
<Japanda> Meanwhile: Let me fill you in
<CK|Asleep> Pft. Why bother with Notepad? You have IRC, that's basically multiplayer Notepad
<Snuffsis> haha
<Meanwhile> Japanda: please. Just. Stay quiet.
<mario_pony> Silver_Streak: *mindblow*

<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<otakon> kirzstryfe: I could be doing better, but my sister's house was broken into.
<Snuffsis> It's still the saddest vid ever though. :(
<MirrorImage> the most effective protest would be simply not purchasing The Last Roundup with regards to Derpy
<MirrorImage> purchase every other episode, but don't purchase The Last Roundup
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u0t8ZIlwuQ power up the bass canon
<Meanwhile> What is this 'purchase' you speak of?
<Japanda> Darn, I just Bought the last ROUND UP

<Meanwhile> Seriously, I only watch the eps via youtube.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Dark__Horst> that little vid is pretty high up in tranks
<Snuffsis> we needed some space in here
<kirzstryfe> 1,3buying the episodes is the best way to convince Hasbro to keep the show going
<MirrorImage> indeed
<Meanwhile> Things in this fandom that've brought me to the verge of tears: *shrugpony*
<Japanda> I bought all of SEASON 1
<MirrorImage> and by not purchasing The Last Roundup, you show them what you don't like
<Garrus_Vakarian> Sup guys
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NoRUgH9Chs&feature=related this is what happens when I youtube hop
<Japanda> and I bought every current season 2 Episode
<CalmCanary> :3
<Meanwhile> I bought a rock.
<Snuffsis> I'd buy the episodes, but i aint touching iTunes with a 10ft pole
<Japanda> Lol
<mario_pony> 11 ft?
<Japanda> snuffsis
<SaxyPretender> 0,14everything better, CalmCanary?
<Dark__Horst> Meanwhile, you cold hearted beast!
<Japanda> Pirate the episodes, then donate the money to Hasbro
<Snuffsis> no, 10 ft!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I have s1, but I'm waiting for s2 to go on sale before I get it
<CalmCanary> I think so, SaxyPretender. I hope.
<Dken2021> what about a 10 3/4 pole?
<Meanwhile> Dark__Horst: Sup.
<Tovler> I'm pretty sure buying toys is the best way to support the show. I'm doubt they're making any money off of iTunes.
<Japanda> I bought the MLP playpacks also
<Japanda> One for me and my Girlfriend.
<MirrorImage> Tovler - different departments within Hasbro
<Snuffsis> I'm going to by the MLP DVDs instead. :P
<DeadpoolDash> i will buy when they hit DVD, I refuse to support Apple
<MirrorImage> you want to support the animation department, not the merchandise department necessarily
<Dashy> ..
<Dken2021> I'm not interested in the toys
<Japanda> The toys are good
<Pinkies4thWall> I'll buy a FULL season dvd
<Japanda> You should buy them DKEN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, the show IS a sort of vehicle to buy the toys
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall - we all would
<Meanwhile> Indeed. Needs more season box set.
<Dashy> what is the next episod ?
<MirrorImage> but evidently Hasbro isn't willing to gamble with that just yet
<Tovler> We need to ask Hasbro what's the best way to support the show.
<Dken2021> nah, not that kind of fan
<Meanwhile> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 4 days, 13 hours, 45 minutes, 9 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)

<SaxyPretender> 0,14;__;
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm saying no other dvd.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I don't think it works for me because I have colors

<Maid_Discord> 11,01I wish the MW3 torrent had MP.

<PinkieSpice> o-o
<otakon> Maid_Discord: you know, Mass Effet 3 has a MP version

<Meanwhile> ^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I'm not buying EA games.
<otakon> lol
*PinkieSpice conisders hoping onto a round of l4d2

<Maid_Discord> 11,01I don't normally like to pirate.
<Hazard> enjoy :3
<otakon> Maid_Discord: you should at least play ME1, it wasn't published by EA
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I only torrented MW3 to try it out since no demo exists.
<Placebo> Maid_Discord: Buy them from Gamestop used, then. EA doesn't get anything out of that.

<Meanwhile> EA can suck shub-niggurath.
<Placebo> I've heard a few publishers are pushing to make games console specific, like PC games.. >.>
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Meanwhile: EA doesn't want to give money away to Steam. They also don't want to abide by Valve DLC policy.
<Placebo> Don't see it passing, but still.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Which forces publishers to release all DLC (PC) w/o exclusivity.
<Meanwhile> Humbug.
<Bluestrom_S> check this out, pretty awesome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gFphKisP_w&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Meaning if a developer or publisher wants to release DLC, they have to release it on Steam.

*RainbowJack hugs filly fillyy"goodnight"

<Hazard> "Atleast I got chicken..."
*Pinkies4thWall is my Gamertag
*OneTrickPony slaps Meanwhile with a large trout for a bit
<Midnight_Tempest> pfft xbox, PC is the way to go for gaming
*RainbowJack hase xboa but not that game
<Meanwhile> Leeroy is best Jenkins.
*Meanwhile baas at OneTrickPony.
<Hazard> ^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01PC is the way to go except DRM.
<Pinkies4thWall> Best Leeroy: http://derpy.me/6WF45
<Dark__Horst> borderlands 2: implaying that "GAJILLION GUNS ROLFLOLROXORS" make a game good
<OneTrickPony> okat
<Dark__Horst> i personally have no idea about borderrlands, never palyed it, but COME ON
<otakon> Dark__Horst: did you play and like the last game?
<OneTrickPony> lol 96.8% moar wub in Broderlands 2
<Dark__Horst> nope
<Meanwhile> Allright chums times up, let's do this. LEEEEROOOOOY JEEEEENKIIIIINS.
<otakon> Dark__Horst: one of the key features was the HUGE selection of random guns you would get
<Dark__Horst> but those trailer catchphrases made me facepalm so fucking hard
<Placebo> Pinkies4thWall: I had Borderlands for the 360, but got rid of it. I'll be getting the 2nd one, most likely.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3here, everyone go watch this so I can get some work done for the next 25 minutes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg :p
<Hazard> Francis is a dick :P
<Meanwhile> I've played too much WoW in my life.
<Conyst> at least I have Scootaloo
<otakon> Dark__Horst: anything from Shotguns that shot rockets to Sniper Rifles that lit your enemies on fire
<Bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDlaJlb1ezg
<Hazard> Conyst: :3
<RoseyPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&feature=related
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I also am turned off of MP games like CoD and BF because multiple reasons.
<Dark__Horst> maybe i'd give borderlands a go if it'd drop the cellshading and monthly costs
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I tried to get into them but faile.d
<Hazard> dafuq RoseyPony
<RoseyPony> heh
<Pinkies4thWall> Better by 420% than CoD & BF COMBINED
<Meanwhile> Ya know what you should do Maid_Discord?
<Dark__Horst> becasue,r eally, cellshading on a game like that just looks stupid
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Probably sell BF3.
<Meanwhile> Well, yeah. But roll a mage on Warcraft.
<Meanwhile> Seriously, my guild has been lacking arcane intellect for ages.
<Hazard> DO A BARREL ROLL
*Hazard does a barrel roll
*RainbowJack still cries Manly tears at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&list=FLVhqx62iPB434Y5xGi60vVA&index=12&feature=plpp_video
<Hazard> ^
<Dark__Horst> fifth time i see that today
<Meanwhile> More Derpy overreaction. woohoo.
*Hazard thinks Francis is a dick for calling Derpy a freak
<Placebo> I don't understand how we can complain about EA's online passes, then pay a monthly subscription to a game you had to pay for in the first place..
<Conyst> It's not all that difficult to be better than a new 60 dollar map pack
<otakon> DAMN IT RainbowJack
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I complain because it's a bad idea.
<RainbowJack> what?
<Hazard> they could just add 10 dollars onto the original cost
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It's publishers trying to get more money they don't deserve.
<Placebo> Buy a new copy for 60 bucks, it comes with one.
<Meanwhile> Take ALL your hard earned cash.
<Dark__Horst> now what'S this about ea passes i hear?
*RainbowJack hugs otakon
<otakon> Placebo: no, they don't all the time. A lot of times it's friggin peer to peer.
<RoseyPony> we must save derpy
<Hazard> i wish Dead Space 2 wasnt ruined by pricey online passes
<Dark__Horst> what online passes?
<Meanwhile> I wish Dead Space wasn't a bad game.
<Placebo> otakon: Was thinking of WoW, specifically.
<otakon> oh
<Maid_Discord> 11,01They come up with things that customers will believe so they can rip the off.
*Hazard hates EA for betraying the gaming community
<otakon> Placebo: yeah, but that's online ONLY
<Bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngalLRjhUM&feature=related
<Pinkies4thWall> There's an all-inclusive box with all 4 dlc maps in token form
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Computer crash #2.
*DeadpoolDash Guild Wars 2 looks really good
<otakon> it's like Diablo 3 that's coming out sometime in 2015
<Pinkies4thWall> and a foldout poster
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Hell, the gaming community is partially to blame for publisher BS.
<Pinkies4thWall> still
<Hazard> XD
<Maid_Discord> 11,01They complain but don't take action.
<Dken2021> laters chatroom, I have that thing called sleep to do, smell you later
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Case-in-point, COD.
<Meanwhile> Bye Dken2021.
<Pinkies4thWall> Borderlands is best FPS
<Bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwvUQBOnW6o&feature=related
<Placebo> otakon: But having to buy a game, and then pay the monthly costs? That doesn't make a lick of sense.
<Bluestrom_S> bye Dken2021
<Dark__Horst> oh, i'm gonna take action. pirate all the roigin games
*Dken2021 waves goodbye
<Dark__Horst> ea won't get another cent from me, evr again
<Meanwhile> Borderlands sucks a dumb rock.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Dk...awww, he left ;___;
*Pinkies4thWall tolerates Meanwhiles hater view
<otakon> Meanwhile: you do not know what you SPEAK!
<otakon> a'www I missed Dken?
*Hazard thought everything was fine with Dead Space 2 until he got the message saying 'Slave buy the Online Pass or you can't play online mindless Consumer.'
<DeadpoolDash> Borderlands is fun for a while, but gets repetitive really quick
<otakon> Hazard: indeed man
<Placebo> ^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01^^^
<Pinkies4thWall> because you're free to that idea
<Placebo> But, co-op.
<Meanwhile> See that right there? See that piece of garbage you're defending? That's why publishers can get away with selling you shit. Because you'll still buy it.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I played co-op once, but it was with high-levelled people.
*Hazard got into Dead Rising 2 2 weeks ago and has thought it to be a fun and humorous game since
<Pinkies4thWall> Otakon: you <3 borderlands as well?
<Dashie_Dashie> I modded my borderlands profile.
*Dashie_Dashie shrugs
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall: I enjoyed it greatly
<Midnight_Tempest> borderlands is a great game, one of my favs.. cant wait for BL2
<Hazard> who doesnt want to see a grown man with a cowboy outfit on riding a pink trycicle in a zombie hord?
*Pinkies4thWall only uses sheild mods on Craw
<otakon> Hazard: um, I have no idea
<Pinkies4thWall> never anywhere else
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Publishers get away with things mainly because not enough gamers react to publisher BS by not buying their games.
<Hazard> otakon: play Dead Rising 2
*RainbowJack plays some WOW
<Pinkies4thWall> Borderlands came fresh, so fanbase was nonexistent
*Hazard thinks WOW sucks big TITS
<Placebo> I really don't see the reason to protest a company for trying to get their money out of a game they made.
<Pinkies4thWall> unlike some games
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It is an issue about supporting developers under a bad publisher...
<Meanwhile> That sounds like a compliment Hazard.
<Pinkies4thWall> cough*cod*couhg
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Developers are becoming casualties.
<Bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHziLuIDRzM
*Hazard said it as a compliment and a insult but mainly as a compliment
<Midnight_Tempest> WoW is ok... i would play it if it was more, you know... free
<Hazard> ^
<Meanwhile> Alas.
<Pinkies4thWall> GEARBOX IS BEST DEV
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Lol CoD.
<Bluestrom_S> I loved vanilla wow
<Bluestrom_S> bc was ok
<Midnight_Tempest> CoD sucks
<Bluestrom_S> wrath was meh so so
<Hazard> i still think Minecraft is the shit
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I love how people will pay a subscription fee for a service.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm looking forward to mainly fighting games this year
<Conyst> lol map packs
<Pinkies4thWall> VERY loyal to their gamers
<Waks> I really just want to watch the next episode.
<Meanwhile> Bluestrom_S is old and stuck in his ways.
<Pinkies4thWall> If there's a problem, they FIX it
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I think CoD MP will go subscription-based soon,
*Hazard saw in Game Informer that it was the best Downloadable game of the year
<Midnight_Tempest> dat Saxy, fighting mod!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<RainbowJack> i am looking forward to Fighting is Magic
<Bluestrom_S> I started wow when I was 14 back in nov of 04
<Bluestrom_S> loved the game
<Hazard> ^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Elite was created solely for making money.
<Bluestrom_S> I loved the warcraft universe in general
<Hazard> Bluestrom_S: if u got ur account cancelled would u freak out like that one kid on youtube?
<Hazard> shoving a shoe up ur but?
<Meanwhile> I started about a year before Wrath came out. I still love it.
*RainbowJack played a lot of WARCRAFT 2
<Pinkies4thWall> my gt is Pinkies4thWall
<Bluestrom_S> back then yeah
<Bluestrom_S> I love my hero
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm loking forward to, Blazblue Continuum Shift Extend (yes, I know it's out), Persona 4: Area, Skullgirls
<kirzstryfe> 1,3WoW was good through BC and picked up a bit during Ulduar, otherwise it's been going downhill for years
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and of course, Fighting is Magic
<Midnight_Tempest> Bluestrom_S: I like the warcraft games and universe too, until i found out that it was all stolen from the Warhammer games... same with Starcraft being a copy of Warhammer 40K
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and oh yeah, the GGAC+ port
<Meanwhile> If there's one thing that's consistent in WoW it's people complaining that the next expansion is going to ruin it.
<Meanwhile> Every single time.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm waiting for Skyrim DLC and halo 4, that's it.
<Placebo> Mass effect 3 and eventually Borderlands 2.. That's all that I've seen that interests me this year.
*Hazard thinks Blockland is Over-rated and ROBLOX needs to be erased from America's history
<Conyst> well the next expansion is being made just to make money
<Midnight_Tempest> ugh... halo 4... >_< im probably gonna play it too...
<Meanwhile> Halo. Now there's a really bad series.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3doesn't matter to me if it does, I dropped my sub about 4 months after Cata
<Bluestrom_S> Midnight_Tempest I found that out later too, but it all started when my brother and his friends were playing diablo 2 and dark age camelot and warcraft 3
<Pinkies4thWall> I will never play another CoD.
<Placebo> ^
<Bluestrom_S> when wow came out it was very nice, the universe and detail, the freedom it was great
<MahBoi777> >_>
*Hazard is going to expect HALO 4 to be better than Halo Reach or he will march to the store and slap the clerk in the face until he gives him his money back
<Pinkies4thWall> BF may be dropped from my screen, too
<Dashie_Dashie> Meanwhile, if you want to talk about bad series, let's talk CoD.
<Pinkies4thWall> ^
<Placebo> ^^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I don't hate CoD.
<Meanwhile> We could talk either tbh Dashie_Dashie they're both as crap as each other.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I just hate what Activision has done to it.
*Pinkies4thWall :) at mention of CoD fail
<Hazard> CoD is in line with HALO and Battlefield right now
<Conyst> I haven't played cod since 4
<Bluestrom_S> The friends I made in the game too is what kept me playing up until wrath
<Bluestrom_S> HALO > COD
<Midnight_Tempest> Halo has a great storyline, thats the only reason i play the series... i love the story
<Dashie_Dashie> Halo was my first multiplayer game, I'll never trash it >_>
<Bluestrom_S> im sorry I had to say it
<Dashie_Dashie> loved it ever since.
<Placebo> No. You can debate Halo and Battlefield going downhill, but CoD's been shit for years.
<Hazard> COD > BF
<Maid_Discord> 11,01They whored out CoD.
<Meanwhile> Stabbing myself in the leg with scissors > Halo.
<DeadpoolDash> CoD hasn't really evolved at all
*Pinkies4thWall has never played any halo game
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I liked Halo.
<Bluestrom_S> I agree 100% Midnight_Tempest
<kirzstryfe> 1,3activision's good at doing that Maid_Discord
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I know.
<MahBoi777> I love Halo and Battlefield
<Bluestrom_S> I loved COD 2 that was my favotire
*Hazard kicks Pinkies4thWall in the dick and shoves him out the door to buy an Xbox and a Halo game
<Dashie_Dashie> CoD series in a nutshell, cut the graphics engine from previous cods, paste it in, use a new hub for your FoV, and slap in a few new guns.
<Dashie_Dashie> new cod game
<Bluestrom_S> all else is meh 4 wasok too
<Placebo> At least Halo and BF introduced new elements, and at least attempt to appease their customers.. CoD is just.. CoD.
<DeadpoolDash> BF was at its best with BF1942
<Midnight_Tempest> the BF games are boring, ive never liked MP games... hence why i rarely play any MMO's
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Activision's also invincible to bad PR.
<Pinkies4thWall> Is BF3 worth it for the single player?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01BF games to me are too frustrating.
<Hazard> Activision is a GOD right now
<Hazard> along with EA
<Placebo> PinkiePieCopy: Eh.. Buy it used.
<Bluestrom_S> I decided not to buy BF3 because of origin
<Conyst> from what I hear no
<DeadpoolDash> EA can go eat a dick
<Hazard> ^
<Placebo> I don't care for EA, but it won't stop me from buying ME3.
<Meanwhile> I really want to play L4D now.
<Pinkies4thWall> if BF3 has bad singleplay, i'm not getting
<Hazard> Portal 2 is best Cooperative Game and best Puzzle game of 2011
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Portal wa gread
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*great
<MahBoi777> L4D2 is a gud game
<Meanwhile> Dat gread.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I still need to play portal...
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Buying a game from a publisher you hate will not change the publisher.
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont normally buy games anymore... if i can get it from TPB then i will, otherwise i only buy games that I like... like ME3
<DeadpoolDash> the sports games every year is BS, just do a roster update through a download
<Conyst> It's like the cod single player
<Meanwhile> Saxy you're missing out.
<Bluestrom_S> first time beating HL2 ep2 made me cry in the end...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know ;___;
<Hazard> i played through the story 10 times and it still amuses me
<Placebo> SaxyPretender: get Portal 2 on steam.. I still need someone to Co-op with >.>
<WafflesLovesDerpy> Anythng on.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this computer's a netbook though
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Saxy, can your PC handle Portal2?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so it's AAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS for games
<Maid_Discord> 11,01They'll just go "well, we can screw them this far. Let's see how much more we can milk from them."
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Portal 1 crashes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14TF2 crashes
<Bluestrom_S> I'd love to play P@
<Bluestrom_S> P2
<Meanwhile> Pacman crashes?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heck, even Half-Life 2 crashes
<DeadpoolDash> most valve games crash at some point
<Placebo> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> someone send Saxy a desktop STAT!
<Hazard> idk guys MW3 had a DECENT story and a DECENT multiplayer but BO was better :P
<Placebo> bo?
<Hazard> Black Ops
<otakon> BF
<otakon> oh
<Placebo> Mfw.
<Pinkies4thWall> Ace combat: i've put 600 hours into that game over the past 6 months
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Garry's Mod crashes all the time, but I suspect that may have something to do with how I play with it :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14funnily enough, I can run Age of Mythology on max settings on thos cpmputer
<Meanwhile> Bowel Ovulation.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14WHICH ACE COMBAT?
<otakon> I still say Battlefield Bad Company 2 was great
<Pinkies4thWall> AH
<SaxyPretender> 0,14WOOHOO
<Hazard> looked like it otakon
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I HATED BF:BC2.
<Placebo> Saying one CoD game is better than another is like comparing a lost leg to a lost arm.
<otakon> Maid_Discord: why?
<Hazard> i still have BF 1943 and it still is a good game
<Maid_Discord> 11,01My MP experience was nothing but mass-frustration.
<Midnight_Tempest> i really wish they had the Ace Combat games for PC... that would be epic
<Pinkies4thWall> Xbox 360, i'm #88 on the leaderboard
<Maid_Discord> 11,01And rage
<Hazard> no story but it still kicks ass
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nice
<otakon> Maid_Discord: well that's just you, I had a LOT of fun with the SP and MP of it.
<Pinkies4thWall> Ace Combat is best flight sim
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I don't have Live anymore, so my rank's probably droped
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I wasn't that good anyway
<Hazard> their making a new Enemy Unknown
<otakon> I have LIVE
<Pinkies4thWall> Saxy: gt?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01That's why BF3 is sitting on my desk unopened.
<otakon> Hazard: eeyup, it's a remake and just like the original
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ThePretender317
<Dashie_Dashie> Games I will never regret buying, Ages of empires, Star Wars KOTH, Halo CE, Twilight Princess, Orcarina of Time, and Tomb Raider.
<otakon> Maid_Discord: you should sell it
<Hazard> it looks fun as hell otakon am i right?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I don't want to open it and find out that I'm going to hate that game as well.
<otakon> Hazard: eeyup, can't wait for it.
*kirzstryfe gets bored and noms on otakon
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Because of a steep-ass learning curve.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01With no tutorial.
<Hazard> SW Knights of The Old Republic was absolutely amazing
*otakon kicks off kirzstryfe towards Hazard
<Hazard> i loved it
<Hazard> and SW Battlefront 2 was an awesome game too
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Dashie_Dashie> WE NEED A REMAKE
<Hazard> i LOVED it
<otakon> Hazard: Knights of the Old Republic made me buy an Xbox.
<Hazard> the glitched D:
<Dashie_Dashie> with actual multiplayer.
<MahBoi777> I liked the Halo CE remake
<Hazard> i loved it soooo much D:
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat feel when one of my Christmas gifts from my ex was the Best of Star Wars on PC
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I've enjoyed TF2 with friends, but I miss games like UT2K4.
<Midnight_Tempest> i still cant play KOTOR... i love bioware games and star wars but the game is just so damn slow for me... ME was easier to get into
<Dashie_Dashie> Halo anniversery?
<MahBoi777> yea
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: get past Taris
<SaxyPretender> 0,14with KOTOR, Battlefront, Empire at War, Republic Commando and one other
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: it speeds up then
<Hazard> Taris.....*shudders*
<Hazard> god damn it Taris
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: i cant... its just too damn slow for me >_<
<Hazard> i had to try atleast 15 times to get past Taris
<Meanwhile> I used to play Battlefront 2 online with a PS2. Jeezus that's nostalgic.
<otakon> eeyup
<Dashie_Dashie> Saxy, what about the one for the N64?
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<otakon> how about Resident Evil Outbreak?
<Meanwhile> PS2 online. I used to play Monster Hunter like that.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I never had an N64 ;______;
<Hazard> being able to play SW BF2 would be pure fucking nostalgia
<Dashie_Dashie> shadow of the empire was it?
<Dashie_Dashie> oh

<Hazard> i would have multiple game-gasms

<otakon> Meanwhile: GODHAND!
<Meanwhile> otakon: No. Monster Hunter
<Meanwhile> You spazz.
<MahBoi777> has anyone here played Homefront? if so, how is it?
<Dashie_Dashie> Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 + the side games will always be my #1 series.
<DeadpoolDash> The Fallout series has always been fun for me, even with all the bugs. the storyline and setting is what really does it for me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I need to play GodHand
<otakon> Meanwhile: I couldn't get the hang of it.
<Hazard> Fallout 3 was the best of them all
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: same here, I LOVED Fallout
<otakon> Hazard: um, nah.
<Hazard> well never played before Fallout 3 but i still love the hell out of it
<otakon> Hazard: I'd say Fallout New Vegas is better
<Midnight_Tempest> ugh... i really do hate my character in Fallout New Vegas... im playing on the Hardcore mode T_T so brutal
<MahBoi777> I've spent so many hours on Fallout 3, lol
<MirrorImage> Hazard - story, maybe, but i enjoyed the various things that New Vegas added to the gameply
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: that's why
<Meanwhile> Every tuesday the vendor for velociprey claws and bone husks was in the market place so you could stock up on level 2 cluster bombs...
<Dashie_Dashie> Bioshock Infinite, that is all.
<MahBoi777> ^
<Hazard> im so close to getting bobblehead trophy....I LOST THE FUCKING ENERGY WEAPONS BOBBLEHEAD!!!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, the only KH I'm willing to try right now is Dream Drop Distance because it has a level from tron: Legacy

<Dashie_Dashie> SaxyPretender, Y U NO PLAY SERIES?
<Dashie_Dashie> you wont regret it .__.

<Hazard> i realized i couldnt get back into Raven Rock and get the bobblehead and I CANT GET THE TROPHY
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because I lack the consoles ;_____;
<Midnight_Tempest> you know, theres an MMO out that is pretty much a Fallout MMO... its called Fallen Earth

<otakon> can't wait until Fallout 4 with the Skyrim engine
<Dashie_Dashie> walking the walking dead.
<Hazard> Lydia and Meeko got fucking tenderized and blown into space
<DeadpoolDash> Fallout 3 mirrors Fallout 1 alot and New Vegas mirrors Fallout 2 a lot
<MirrorImage> has there even been an announcement of a new Fallout game?
<Hazard> oh my god me neither otakon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...mfw I read Lydia as Lyra

<Midnight_Tempest> i dont know otakon... i prefer Fallout 1 the way it was, as a turn based game... not a shooter
<otakon> Hazard: not really, just remaking Fallout 1 using the G.E.C.K.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: me too
<otakon> Ghost Jerky
<DeadpoolDash> fallout 1 and 2 were great for what they were, tactical turn based RPG
<otakon> lol
<Meanwhile> Attack of the giant mudcrab tbh.
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: also Fallout 3 had alot of similarities to Fallout 1 in the way the game played out... same with the similarities between F:NV and Fallout 2
<RainbowJack> well bye bye bronystate have to go to work now
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: eeyup, and that is why the new XCOM DEFENSE game is gonna be AWESOME
<Meanwhile> Bye RainbowJack

<MahBoi777> hi Jaketehsnake
*Meanwhile rolls fluffily over otakon.
*SaxyPretender fires a crossbow at otakon's knee.

<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: holy shit he DID
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Pinkies4thWall> Hai jaketehsnake
