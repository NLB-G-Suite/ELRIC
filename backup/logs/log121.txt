<GumballCrash> we haven't nailed down entirely what element it is yet
<DannySwish> I'm desperate
<R-Zack> Heard that too.
<Aponymous> I should listen to this album again, it's awesome.
<GumballCrash> but we know this: it's a lively one, and it does NOT like the human skeleton
<DannySwish> :D
<Mason_Trowel> So I usually wind up learning the right hand portion for a song, and the left hand portion rots away because I can't seem to get my hands to play them both at the same time.
<Tovler> brb, sorry but I've seen this "way too much, I need a moment"
<DannySwish> so many ponies like Portal!!! :D
<LunarFrost> Razyn you messed it up
<Solarboy> I agree DSNesmith, I mean, it's great. But we watch this at least 3 times every brony movie night
<DannySwish> They're like…tied somehow.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm. What console game should I play?
<MrEvergreen> Portal is cool, that's for sure.
<Darf14> We have seven days for ponies and this event: http://www.qwipster.net/ring.jpg

<SodapopFizz> Disgaea 2
<SilentEcho> Poor things.
<sotha> Lyra!
<Solarboy> Play Riviera The Promised land
<RAWRity> c'mon, the whole thing? It's funny, but it kind of loses its charm when this is the 3rd time in two weeks it's played on here.
<R-Zack> Eeyup.
<SuperBrony64> lol
<Razyn> 0LunarFrost oh bite me, it's been like twenty episodes and three weeks
<SilentEcho> I've never seen it, well I sort of got bored of it
*Luna panics
<DannySwish> How many times have you guys beaten Portal?
<Foshers> Anyone here play tf2?
<Quill2> well some of the stuff isnt even funny, just songs attached to random scenes
<Luna> 07don't hurt the streamer!
<Aponymous> I'm tired of this video too, it being so long doesn't help, at all.

<SilentEcho> LOL

<LunarFrost> are we gonna watch this all?
<sotha> I still like this part.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and if you play my video you wont regret it ;)
<DannySwish> I dislike shooters.
<Alterego> g2g, too busy with game.

<Thunder_Dash> Night, DSN

<RAWRity> same
<Plorf> I have 1000+ hours
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNpMSncPqWM
<Darf14> Twilight is right, the answer is in Pinkie 3.14
<a041744> Pinkie Pi, dodohohohohh....
<Mason_Trowel> And I have no interest in TF2.
<SilentEcho> I only like the intro :3
<Luna> 07cheers
<Sidestroke> Well, most shooters are rated M for a reason.
<DannySwish> 0__0
<ValtheJean> I figure you'll check it first
<Thunder_Dash> I don't really care if we skip it either way
<Nittany_Tiger> Patterns, even in chaos systems?
<DSNesmith> who here's gonna be at the huge EqD marathon tomorrow?
<ValtheJean> so I'll just say
<ValtheJean> it is amazing
<Foshers> Danny, you're describing call of duty more than tf2.
<Luna> 07yep..
<ValtheJean> so give it a chance ;)
<Mason_Trowel> And I only enjoy Portal in a casual sense.
<Razyn> 0Razzle Dazzle~
<DannySwish> I know
<Thunder_Dash> EqD marathon...?
<Quill2> razzle dazzle, you show horse
<HotCocoa> Octavia: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6467881/
<DannySwish> I think TF2 is alright
<DSNesmith> >mfw I know this song from anthology, and not from Chicago
<ValtheJean> ohhhh the good old days of being an animation major...
<Sidestroke> It's so that those who play them are "MATURE" enough to understand that it shouldn't be done in real life.
<Reaver021> eqD marathon? What?
*ValtheJean nostalgias
<DSNesmith> check eqd guys
<DSNesmith> they're doing a big joint thing with, uh
<LunarFrost> i hate the stream keeps cutting out on me
<DSNesmith> some show
<SummerRain> HotCocoa: oh sorry
<R-Zack> Is it me or was Twilight neck long at the lasartt p
<R-Zack> Ugh, TYPOS.
<Sidestroke> However, that gauge is sadly highly variable and quite subjective.
<SummerRain> so so so sorry
<DannySwish> I mean its still stupid
<R-Zack> first part in this clip
<Octavia> HotCocoa, did i not already see that? i do not remember the background though

<R-Zack> BLAAARRR!
<Foshers> Well, molestia is funny, but...I kind of like the personality the show gives her better than the internet stuff.

<Quill2> also unessecary
<ValtheJean> I figured I'd try and see if I could stream them at one point :P
<Mason_Trowel> I'm probably one of the few ponies who has designed their OC to be the equivalent of a human 56 year-old.
<Nittany_Tiger> Guess I could start either Prototype, Dynasty Warriors 5, Saints Row 2, Or RDR.
<Quill2> heh
<R-Zack> ..found them
<HotCocoa> ^Stargazer: there aren't exactly any "masculine" hairstyles are there
<^Stargazer> >_>
<Darf14> I want Derpy vision
<Reaver021> lol

<RAWRity> anyone else watch Nostalgia Critic?
<Trot_Rot> and I'm back

*^Stargazer sits in corner and tries to keep from nodding off
<Trot_Rot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dRGgVZ08WQ
<ValtheJean> must...resist...temptation...to unload shorts onto chat....
<a041744> I love TGWTG
<Nittany_Tiger> I would play Dead Island, but I don't feel like firing up the PC.
<LunarFrost> i got to meet him and be in a vid of his
<Spin> I've made like 4 oc
<DSNesmith> only NC though, I don't like the rest of the channel
<Octavia> http://hyenaspots.com/pics/hiResPony-hayfever-buck.png ..best, only donkey

<Mason_Trowel> I likes it, Octavia. ^_^
<ValtheJean> *animated shorts*
<HotCocoa> Octavia ADOWABLE
<a041744> I like Phelous and Film brain, and some others
<Quill2> the..."OTHER." titanic movie was fucking hilarious
<GumballCrash> cute
<FreezeFrame> Gilda Bale
<LunarFrost> i follow everyone
<DSNesmith> chick is good when she doesn't go off on a long ramble about feminism
<DSNesmith> which is... rarely
<MrMooMoo> You know i like donkeys.

<DSNesmith> best clip in anthology
<Spin> but not Mules
<^Stargazer> neat donkey
<R-Zack> LOL.
<Mason_Trowel> So fortunate it is a donkey. Ya know...since "Mules are ugly". Rarity's words not mine. XD
<a041744> :D
<Quill2> I TAKE A POTATO CHIP...AND EAT IT
<GrimGallop> Lol
<ValtheJean> my company pays for me and a few others to go to Siggraph every year
*^Stargazer has a stuffed donkey he made back when he was in school
<HotCocoa> Mules != donkeys
<ValtheJean> so I always try to stock up on animated shorts then :P
<RAWRity> I watch a lot of 'em actually. Film Brain, Phelous, Todd in the Shadows, Spoony, JesuOtaku, Cinema Snob, and occasionally Nash. Though the flamewar on one of Nash's vids has put me off him.
*VioletVanilla has no idea what Siggraph is, but it sounds delicious~
<Spin> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<MrMooMoo> Donkeys and Cows are my favorite animals!
<ValtheJean> Ah Siggraph
<Darf14> If you play Deathnote backwards its about a guy that revives everyone with his magical book
<Mason_Trowel> Mules are not donkeys
<Octavia> ^
<ValtheJean> it's a new-age technology convention
<Reaver021> Darf, LOL
<DSNesmith> film brain can be entertaining
<Mason_Trowel> Mules are Donkey/Horse hybrids.
<SilentEcho> hehe
<MrMooMoo> Wee-snaw
<Aponymous> I Ran justifies all the dumb shit from the '80s, imo.
<ValtheJean> people show off their up-coming software
<CaptainNetz> by erasing their names with a pencil
<ValtheJean> and hardware
<FreezeFrame> If you play Momento backwards, it makes complete sense.

<SuperBrony64> Alone in the Dark!
<MrMooMoo> Triple flip mc-twist
<Trot_Rot> derpy's eye condition means she see's more at once than we do
<Quill2> anyone else remeber this show?
<ValtheJean> Siggraph is just really popular with CG design and whatnot
<FreezeFrame> Are you Afraid of the Dark
<Aponymous> I loved this show.
<DSNesmith> we haven't watched moonbase alpha pmv in AGES
<LunarFrost> i loved that show
<ValtheJean> we try to get our booth close to Autodesk every time :P
<Trot_Rot> this is both good and bad
<FreezeFrame> I LOVED this show
<SodapopFizz> Snap, I just got the chills
<Cesco> SHE SEES ALL
<RAWRity> If you play Rocky Horror backwards, it's about a couple who gradually become less and less sexually active until they eventually leave their friends and watch a couple get divorced.
<R-Zack> Haha

<Mason_Trowel> Solo should know
<DSNesmith> whatever happened to Lazytown, anyway
<LunarFrost> if you play power rangers backwards its about giant monsters who shrink
<RAWRity> If you watch FIM backwards, it's a about a group of friends who, after unleashing an unspeakable evil on the world that eventually disappears, all grow distant from one another until Twilight Sparkle leaves to study with Celestia.

<Tovler> It took me a while but I found My Little 1up
*Luna sobs
<Thunder_Dash> As much as I liked Portal 2, I wish it had been a bit more puzzle-oriented than story-oriented
<Skipsy> I may no be big hockey fan, but it was requested! :D http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/Drawings/anotherpony.png
<Aponymous> I miss this show.

<Pizzicato> Ew.
<Pizzicato> Habs.
<Pizzicato> Bross.
<Pizzicato> Gross.
<Skipsy> lol
<Darf14> I agree, too much story and not enough puzzles...unless you play MP
<DSNesmith> aren't the spice girls, like, anti ponies
<RAWRity> because Zebrahead are awesome, that's why
<R-Zack> Catchy song.
<Quill2> hehehehe
<DSNesmith> they're best friends forever
<Reaver021> GAH MY SOUL
<Thunder_Dash> yeah, the co-op was awesome

<hmc1> lol
<Quill2> this so works
<Trot_Rot> I capped 9001
<SuperBrony64> Nothing to go off of the name Beavis huh?
<Lyser> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sZ23SaTV_g
<TrollightSparkle> Typing this from my new rig which works so wonderfully well :)))
<Lyser> is there a better song in history
<^Stargazer> I know I'm drinking tons and tons of Caffine the night before Saturday
<Lyser> I honestly don't believe so
<SuperBrony64> Hey Trollight
<Reaver021> Scrubs.
<DSNesmith> trollightsparkle, specs! do it!
<Trot_Rot> paused the script for the clock at that precise moment
<R-Zack> This make sense.
<MrMooMoo> Its at 6am here.

<Thunder_Dash> Ans awesome holidays~
<TrollightSparkle> AMD X3 455 3.3Ghz
<Reaver021> What?
<Darf14> WWU!
<R-Zack> The ending made so much sense.
<TrollightSparkle> Sapphire HD Radeon 6870
<Thunder_Dash> *And
<Quill2> OK DONT CARE ABOUT BIT REMIXES
<SuperBrony64> What's the countdown for?
<Luna> 07bedtime :)
<TrollightSparkle> 4GB DDR3 1333mhz
<RAWRity> trollightsparkle new rig eh, got a name for it?
<Lordlyhour> Yes
<Luna> 07playlist time for you guys :)
<Lordlyhour> there is
<DSNesmith> sigh
<TrollightSparkle> Goodnight Lunar!
<Lordlyhour> most every other song
<SuperBrony64> oh ok
<Lyser> no
<Darf14> The countdown is for the end of the world :o
<TrollightSparkle> Luna*
<Lyser> lies all
<Luna> 07not yet!
<DSNesmith> still working off of 2GB DDR2 T.T
<Luna> 0745 mins!
<Reaver021> Oh my, Trollightsparkle. That's got some PonyPower!
<TrollightSparkle> Close enough..?
<SuperBrony64> What!? 2 GB is a sin!
<TrollightSparkle> Indeed it does :)
*SouthernCross won't be able to watch S2E1 untill Sunday due to timezones
<Filter> Plenty of songs
<DSNesmith> yeah 2GB is awful
<TrollightSparkle> And DDR2 too?!
<Lordlyhour> Like, if you name a song
<TrollightSparkle> WHAT MADNESS IS THIS?!
<DSNesmith> cripplingly slow
<Reaver021> oh, 6gb @1066
<FreezeFrame> I've got an Asus G53-JW
<SuperBrony64> Even though that's what my MacBook Pro is running on :P
<Lordlyhour> its better than that opne
<Lordlyhour> mostly
<TrollightSparkle> But jk, it's something right?
<Lyser> and yet, no songs are named
<DSNesmith> I keep trying to upgrade
<DSNesmith> and failing miserably
<Spin> okay Never Say Never
<DSNesmith> first I bought RAM that my motherboard didn't have room for
<Lordlyhour> Anything by the beatles
<Pedo_Bear> I'm looking for the CMC have you seen them?
<Lordlyhour> anything by pink floyd
<Filter> Lets start with Ok Go. This Too Shall Pass
<DSNesmith> then I bought the wrong kind and got the tiny laptop sticks online
<MrMooMoo> !moon spin
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, MrMooMoo!
<Lordlyhour> anything by simon and garfunkle
<DSNesmith> then I tried to return them
<DSNesmith> I'm still fighting with NEwegg over that
<Lordlyhour> anything by dragon force
<Filter> Bon Jovi
<DSNesmith> bleh
<Lordlyhour> Anything I randomly make up on the spot and/or sing in the shower
<Razyn> 0dat lyra
<Darf14> Always check if the RAM is compatable with the mother board
<Lordlyhour> anything by OK go
<TrollightSparkle> I did that about 2 years ago lol, I bought 2GB of the wrong kind of RAM for my laptop.. never bothered to get an RMA for it.
<Lyser> all lack analogue synthesizers
<DSNesmith> yeah that was dumb of me
<Lyser> and are immediately unworthy
<Lordlyhour> So?
<DSNesmith> I dunno how I misread the description so badly
<TrollightSparkle> It happens though.
<Lordlyhour> If a band requires synthesizers
<Reaver021> Asus P5QL/EPU Mobo, 6gb RAM (@1066mhz) 1gb ATi Radeon HD 5670, Intel E47000 (shitty) 250gb SATA 7200 Primary, old IDE 80gb secondary.
<Lordlyhour> they suck
<Lyser> if a band requires guitars...
<Lordlyhour> automatically
<Pizzicato> Everything would sound better with a B3 solo.
<Lyser> this band has none
<deoxys> 0Ha. Alex S apparently is going to be remixing Adventure Time songs now, too.
<TrollightSparkle> At Reaver :O
<Solo> Huh?
*Silvermane hugs Luna. ILU Princess
<Filter> Hell, this is better http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
<Solo> dangit Pizzicato :P
<SuperBrony64> There needs to be a MLP; FiM video game, but a GOOD ONE
<R-Zack> Beer, Pizza Hut, Chicken Wings, Apples, Jesus
*Luna thanks SIlvermane
<Pizzicato> Hammond B3 organ.
<R-Zack> Makes sense.
<Pizzicato> Get up ons some Deep Purple.
<Trot_Rot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo
<DSNesmith> man, a good MLPFIM game
<Darf14> Could be worse, you could put the sauder side of the mother board up against the metal case and turned on the power
<FreezeFrame> Like Story of the Blanks?
<Lordlyhour> anything played using lightning as the insturment is better
<DSNesmith> for the DS or somehting
<Trot_Rot> ^ none of you can top this ^
<a041744> How about Fighting is Magic
<DSNesmith> with sprites
<Lordlyhour> because, thats damn awesome
<FreezeFrame> solder*
<DSNesmith> would be so awesome
<TrollightSparkle> Video games based off of TV shows and movies usually flop, you know..
<Luna> 07So we need Rocky Horror PMVs!
<RAWRity> special thinks goes out to Jesus for holding off that Rapture!
<Reaver021> TrollightSparkle, it's not that great. Well, fuck it. I just need a better CPU.
<Luna> 07Who is up for the challenge?
<SuperBrony64> HASBRO!
<TrollightSparkle> The challenge?
<Silvermane> mfw i hug Luna, and i get 'thanks' *cry*
<DSNesmith> trollightsparkle, because they usually don't give a shit while making thme
<crono_flash> One of my friends is making one SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> lol
<GrimGallop> o.o
<SilentEcho> It's over!!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would be, but I have enough on my plate atm :P
<RAWRity> not me, I no know how to edit
<R-Zack> I still have that vid XD
<Whimsical> Needs more Equestriaonline
<Darf14> next vid
<Thunder_Dash> A sort of adventure-game-kinda-thing like Story of the Blanks would work well if they put enough effort into it, IMO
<Lyser> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUYsf6Zga94
<DSNesmith> we no speak americano?
<Spin> TrotRot: true
<ValtheJean> 2,14 OH YES
<Lyser> japanese deep purple
<Lyser> supra-everything
<DSNesmith> wtf is this 0.o
<R-Zack> The End?
<SuperBrony64> Really? What's it called ValtheJean?
<Sumica> starts with the end?
<sotha> What about Equestria Online?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sit back and enjoy every pony, you're about to gain some culture
<Whimsical> UM
<Aponymous> What?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's called "The End"
<rivets> how horrifying
<Pizzicato> Oh shit.
<Pizzicato> Ten seconds in
<Reaver021> What am I watching? Tis' creepies.
<SilentEcho> D:
<Pizzicato> I am digging this so hard.
<R-Zack> Equestria Online is on a well pace so far.
<Tovler> french pastries?
<Darf14> Is this the rejected version of 9?
<Pizzicato> Oh my god.
<Whimsical> UM NO
<DSNesmith> this is reminiscent of 9
<TrollightSparkle> This looks like something off of Courage the Cowardly Dog IMO
<mib_7thgm4> what was the name of that the previous video?
<DSNesmith> dat herdmind
<Tovler> inb4 herdrage
<herospirit> *walks into Stream*
<SodapopFizz> I love 9
<herospirit> ........................
<MeownaOnTheMoon> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:07h:47m:44s
<DSNesmith> 9 was seriously underrated
<DSNesmith> the story was a little bland
<R-Zack> So far things have been going well on developing and whatever the other ponies do.
<TrollightSparkle> mib_7thgm4 It was called Ponies the Anthology
<Whimsical> WTF IS THIS?
<RAWRity> well, this looks boring, I'm off to write for a bit, be back once I hit 16667 words
<SuperBrony64> Oh this is a short where a Magpie befriends a Scarecrow
<DSNesmith> but the animation and characters were fantastic
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Hoennshy (Update Part 10!) (http://tinyurl.com/5r8qkgr)
<R-Zack> But what am I looking at?
<SirSprinkles> 6...we're not in Kansas anymore...
<Reaver021> Pokerface.
<rivets> oh fuck oh shit fuck aaahhhhh
<a041744> I dont even man...........
<Pizzicato> Everything needs more B3 solos, like if you write a song and it doesn't have a distorted B3 solo, you need to rewrite it.
<Aponymous> I still need to watch 9, it looked cool.
<herospirit> This is going to give me nightmares isn't it
<mib_7thgm4> ty
<GrimGallop> Bah, Fiddlesticks...
<LunarFrost> this is kinda freaking me out
<DSNesmith> 9 was boss
<sotha> Is this like that episode in which the Doctor becomes human in 1913 and there's the Blood Family?
<R-Zack> I have headphones.
<DSNesmith> and the characters were great
<TrollightSparkle> Oh god oh man oh god oh man
<Darf14> Scarecrow is failing at his job
<Tovler> I never finished 9. I got bored
<Whimsical> TURN IT OFF!
<Trot_Rot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDKKq-_4ANU
<DSNesmith> FAILCROW
<a041744> Scarecrow court?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 You will take the culture and you will like it!
<Trot_Rot> have fun with that one
<Lyser> socrates never even approached the fundamental truth in the above statement
<R-Zack> I understand this story?
<Lordlyhour> alright
<Thunder_Dash> I haven't even watched 9, I want to but still
<Darf14> hey, I was right!
<deoxys> 0slenderman?
<Lordlyhour> in 40 minutes
<Luna> 07:p
<RAWRity> aponymous it's alright, I was hoping for more, and the story...kind of needed some work.
<Lordlyhour> someone do !s2
<R-Zack> They are accusing him for befriending a scarecrow.
<Reaver021> Officially creeped.
<Luna> 07only sometimes?
<Luna> 07:D
<Pizzicato> You do it.
<ValtheJean> okay okay, all the time :P

<AllisZero> SCARY AS FUCK
<RAWRity> MY LITTLE SCARECROW: FRIENDSHIP IS ILLEGAL
<Spin> wtf am i watching?
<Whimsical> So hes supposed to care the crow
<AllisZero> GO BACK TO KILLING INTERNET DRAGONS
<R-Zack> You have the understand the story just by actions.
<Filter> Porn?
<Filter> Just a guess
<sotha> 9 looked cool. It had good world-setting. But the story itself. . .
<Pizzicato> Dude, this Flower Travellin' Band sounds awesome.
<Whimsical> And petting one is illegal
<Pizzicato> Is the rest of their stuff like this?
<DSNesmith> yeah don't watch 9 for the story
<Lyser> hell yeah *highfive*
<SilentEcho> I'mma go.
<DSNesmith> it's very simplistic
<SummerRain> somebody

<Darf14> Man, that bird is a jerk!

<Darf14> Fluttershy, she likes to **** Rabbits
<Lordlyhour> Alestorm is awesome
<Pizzicato> Some people are paid to write, there's a reason why the people who aren't paid to write aren't paid to write.
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybSGMkqWbQ <-- every time they say "Chuck Norris", take a shot. See how quickly you get drunk.

*Silvermane defends Fluttershy with a weapon of deadly nature
<Whimsical> Twi is always saying shit
<Lordlyhour> So what
<DSNesmith> what's with you and falling off shit today?
<Mason_Trowel> Much like the stubborn idiots who think all bronies are perverse sexual deviants.
<HaysforPonies> 10 shots? Challanege accepted.
<R-Zack> Dragon scales can be fashioned into armor and gun shrapenel.
<Lordlyhour> You;ve read every fic on EQ daily?
<Sumica> that one sucked
<a041744> *** Yourself!!
<HaysforPonies> Oh wait...I'm not of age yet. Not till the 17ths.

<Pizzicato> No Lordlyhour, I have standards so I can't read that much shit.
<DSNesmith> YOU LITTLE ****
<R-Zack> Lol?
<DSNesmith> oh, man, applejack's worst element demonstration ever

<Pizzicato> This is what happens when you give a teenager admin rights.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 honestly I don't think S1's premiere was that bad...
<Thunder_Dash> worried that it'll be more a repeat than anything else
<Spin> I recomend Spiderses as a startingfic
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm 27, smartass.
<Mason_Trowel> He's not a tenn
<Mason_Trowel> *teen
<Octavia> 13Luna <3

<Mongoose> Hello
<SirReginald> lol
<R-Zack> Haha
<RAWRity> DSNesmith I think it'll be alright, now that we have a better handle on the characters, if they do something like that it'll feel less forced
<Tovler> lol
<Pizzicato> Teenager isn't really an age, it's more of a mindset.
<a041744> LOLOLOL
<RAWRity> hopefully
<Octavia> 13Take a shit please
<Mason_Trowel> And, Pizzicato, did not try limiting it to the stuff rated 6 & 5-star
<Reaver021> And Spikes' Constipation was solved...FOR-EVERRR

<DSNesmith> I was very meh towards the premiere when I first saw it
<DSNesmith> but it's grown on me
<DSNesmith> WOO
<TrollightSparkle> Funny story.. I was like this is okay when I first watched S1 Premiere.. next thing I know, there goes Episode 15 :P
<Spin> Pizzacato probably not best idea to be a dick to admin..
<DSNesmith> PA PA AMERIKANO
<Sumica> Damn she even tells you when you can go to the can.
<Thunder_Dash> I didn't think it was bad, so to speak, just... not that great
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well it takes one to know one, Pizzicato.
<MrMooMoo> Then we're all teenagers
<FreezeFrame> all right, I better call it a night
<FreezeFrame> Got rehearsal tomorrow

<DSNesmith> the video is disappointing
<DSNesmith> but the song
<Tovler> ... next
<RAWRity> plus the first 2 episodes were originally meant as the season finale, so it should still be like later S1
<Pizzicato> Spin, he's just some guy, you know?
<Sumica> was on the techno station out here all the time.
<Lordlyhour> Hell, if we're talking mindsets, I'm probably still a preteen
<Mason_Trowel> *Did you not?
<Mongoose> Hi Mongoose
<Spin> I'm a teenager so what?
<Darf14> this vid is.....ok
*MrMooMoo is really a teenager.

It's possibly the most pompous and up-oneself thing I've ever seen someone say, and at your age you really should damn well know better. or is the message of love and tolerance preached by the who we are all a fan
<DSNesmith> like I said :P

<Darf14> Mormon? Don't care about them
<ValtheJean> I have a microphone but I'm too scurred to use my webcam :P
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I could be the mute in the corner o.o

<atomic7732> The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 3 million light years (ly) from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is catalogued as Messier 33 or NGC 598, and is sometimes informally referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy, a nickname it shares with Messier 101.

<VioletVanilla> 6,0I do have a midi controller, as well as HatsuneMiku (The actual program) so I could do that. XD
<DannySwish> 21 million lightyears away
<R-Zack> I just said that
<Mongoose> I've been so damn paranoid lately
<R-Zack> I feel invisible
<DannySwish> is the Pinwheel
<atomic7732> oh so it must be M101 then
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, all I can say is aside from the difficulty of finding people who aren't ultra-conservatives, it isn't that bad
<DannySwish> and 3 million could kill us with a supernova
<Mongoose> and I've been having these crazy nightmares
<DannySwish> i think
<R-Zack> Im not sure whether to feel awesome or sad about that.
<SummerRain> im paranoid

<Turtaguin> IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME, BUT ERY EERIE
<Ali1017> First, stop linking the same video
<a041744> How was contagion?
<DSNesmith> we haven't had any Fireflies tonight
<DSNesmith> that's a first I think
<Ali1017> Next, do any of you know how not to lean on the enter key?
<TrollightSparkle> Weird Al Polka Power please..?

<Kencolt> Yankovics himself approves.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 easy everyone, let's not get into religion subjects please
<a041744> But Im not tired!
<abc> hello?
<Turtaguin> I recommend it, but not to germephobes or people with very weak stomaches
<Solo> Ali1017: I apparently do. My last comment in this chat was more than a half-hour ago ;)
<DSNesmith> dat flamebait
<DSNesmith> suddenly FPK thread
<SuperBrony64> Ponyism is the best religion ever!
<RAWRity> that's how much longer the post-show will be, then Luna's going to bed
<Trot_Rot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grU8PPKP1Uk&feature=related
<DannySwish> hiii
<SummerRain> Danny: I am so sorry, i cant. I have somebody sleeping in the same room I am in and I cannot wake them or want to. I dunno about you, but I don't like to be waken up just to the carelessness of others.
<Tovler> But I love flamewars.
<Spin> I like to type typity type type!!
<DannySwish> im wasting time aah
*ValtheJean 2,14 Readies his BanTrident
<Spin> Hi ABC!
<DannySwish> oh, well, you coulda said that.

<R-Zack> Modest Mouse
<Tovler> It lets know how real this "love and tolerance" is
<Reaver021> Will someone steal the stream after luna?
<Reaver021> I know all these songs :/
<abc> Hi, Soin!
<abc> *Spin
<SummerRain> it wasnt 'til 20 minutes ago though
<herospirit> ....... Same here reaver
<VioletVanilla> 6,0HatsuneMiku is a program that basically makes a synthesized voice
<MrMooMoo> I must be luna. Forever alone in the moon...
<Turtaguin> because at one point they peel back the skin off of someone's skull/face in an autopsy toward the beginning of the research against the virus
<DSNesmith> I do, TRixie
<DSNesmith> I do
<TrollightSparkle> Hey what's the name of the vid?
<Sumica> They would be at the door early every other morning rivets
<VioletVanilla> 6,0and my midi controller would play a part of my voice
<SuperBrony64> Sounds like a song Weird Al would do
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Love and Tolerance is as varied as every brony. And since it isn't a community-wide acceptance there is no reason trying to troll people who do
<DSNesmith> ah, Killers polka
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so with that being said, NO trolling topics :P
<Trot_Rot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=V8fk-lo_EEI
<VioletVanilla> 6,0inb4 GLaDOS Violet
<DSNesmith> no trolling?
<DSNesmith> HEY GUYS
<DSNesmith> WHO'S BEST PONY
<ValtheJean> lol
<SuperBrony64> WOAH WOAH
<RAWRity> btw, I'm excited because I finally got to the point where I bring in Trixie for my NaPoWriMo fic
<Reaver021> Turtaguin, doesn't beat the stuff I have on my computer. Autopsies, Beheadings, Bullet wounds, Scalpings, etc.
<Octavia> 13Ahhh. lol XD
<ValtheJean> that's awesome
<TrollightSparkle> Twilight Sparkle, nuff said.
<SuperBrony64> Since when NO TROLLIN'!?
<crono_flash> Anyone up for Ponysona?
<deoxys> 0Fluttershy
<Darf14> Rainbow Dash is best pony DNS
<SummerRain> how am i doing this?
<Fluttershy> o-o huh?
<Octavia> 13That'd be... ugh. lol
<TrollightSparkle> So nobody told me the song name..

<MrMooMoo> Anyone want the #moon? I really dont know what to do with it...
<herospirit> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPLEOOSA!
<Octavia> 13I'd prefer actual voices. :P
<RAWRity> wow, all you guys keep misspelling Rarity, it's weird.
<Spin> Haha wow I love the "i hope the didn't notice all the porn"
<DannySwish> MOFO
<roushguy> whee
<DSNesmith> anyone read the Encyclopedia Dramatica article on bronies?
<ValtheJean> and everyone would think Violet is an artificial intelligence we created :P
<DSNesmith> it's amusing
<DannySwish> lolwut does dat mean
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy is the best Pony ever!
<deoxys> 0I was saying Fluttershy is best pony >_>
<DecapKing> ITS THE FLUTTERSHY!
<DannySwish> XD
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I know I know, I was kidding. . .
<SummerRain> i have so much sleep i am pushing back right now
<DSNesmith> they list all the bona-fide trolling techniques
<Reaver021> APPLEJACK IS BEST PONY.
<DSNesmith> then warn that none of them will actually work
<Tovler> The Appaloosa would be an interesting B-movie.
<SummerRain> and i brush it off like it's nothing
<Darf14> Not me *ahem* Harity!!...oh wait
<Fluttershy> Ah... ><
<a041744> FLuttershy is best, RD is coolest
<SummerRain> i cant even blink
<SummerRain> O_O
<SummerRain> 0_0
<MrMooMoo> Stop teasing me Filter..
*SummerRain stares
<Reaver021> Nope.avi
<Filter> sorry...
<SuperBrony64> I've been watching Pony videos all day today x_x
<RAWRity> Rarity is best pony at everything because ART OF THE DRESS
<roushguy> So
*Filter apology hugs Moo
<Darf14> same here
<DSNesmith> amen to that
<Reaver021> Pony overdose? No such thing.
<roushguy> I nearly had a heart attack like a minute ago
<DSNesmith> man, ponies are gradually consuming my life
<DSNesmith> it's great
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is never enough pony in the world
<Turtaguin> oh, and don't see it if you have a needle phobia or don't do well with edger allen po type storylines
*MrMooMoo accepts apoligy hug.
<Darf14> Its contagious
<a041744> So much Pony 6_9
<LunarFrost> ah i had to restart my internet
<SuperBrony64> Oooo…At the Gala
<Spin> whys that roush?
<herospirit> Oh yah.... I remember this thing I need
<Tovler> Starts Troll Topic: AJ > TS > PP > RD > R > FS
<roushguy> I was channel surfing, went by Animal Planet
<R-Zack> When Season 2 begins, the madness will spread even FASTER THAN BEFORE.
<Kencolt> Still want my fave song...
<Reaver021> Poe is among my favorite people..
<Turtaguin> same, dsnesmith
<DSNesmith> my dormmates keep giving me odd looks
<Octavia> 13:P
<SuperBrony64> YES
<roushguy> And saw a yellowish horse.
<DSNesmith> I love it
<herospirit> Sleep. That's what it's called.
<Turtaguin> YESSSS
*MrMooMoo spells apology wrong.
<Sumica> Ah this one
<DSNesmith> whenever someone walks into my dorm and sees my brushable collection
<DSNesmith> they get this awkward look
<herospirit> I think I'll go try this "sleep" thing
<Octavia> 13I just think it'd be fun to do something similar to what most podcasts do.
<roushguy> I choked for a second because my mind immediately put Fluttershy on the TV
*Sumica waits for the RD solo.
<DSNesmith> and try SO HARD not to mention them
<roushguy> I was like
<RAWRity> dude, I'm 16000 words deep into a my little pony Fanfic about internet memes, Ponies have BECOME my life in between classes
<DSNesmith> it's hilarious
<herospirit> May all your dreams be filled with Pony
<DSNesmith> I love making people uncomfortable
<herospirit> Night all
<roushguy> OHMYGODFLUTTERSHYISREAL
<MrMooMoo> And you yelled Fluttershy!
<a041744> Ponies, Ponies everwhere
<roushguy> No
<Aponymous> Fuck sleep.
<Darf14> Night herospirit
<roushguy> I had a throatful of water
<MrMooMoo> Aww
<ValtheJean> it would be pretty fun
<roushguy> I TRIED to yell it though
<Thunder_Dash> I have this kinda thing that's called "insomnia", it conflicts with that "sleep" thing
<a041744> Sleep is for the weak..
<roushguy> Hence the choking
<Aponymous> Night herospirit
<sotha> Don't mess with the Apple Family.
<SuperBrony64> I would like statues of MLP, but not the brushable dolls
<a041744> *yawns*
<Natleyn> Aww.
<Natleyn> Night herospirit
<Spin> then began licking the screen?
<rivets> my dad has wary looks for my Dinky Doo plushy, he hasn't said anything but you can tell he's disappoint
<DSNesmith> the brushables are kinda fun
<Kencolt> 10 million fluttershys. Just because.
<roushguy> naw
<DSNesmith> they're a little DIY
<Razyn> 0dem horns
<Sumica> Sleep is for those without Caffeene
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<atomic7732> choking =/= heart attack
<roushguy> After recovering I realized two things
<Filter> wut D:
<Aponymous> I want plushies, nothing else.
<RAWRity> fluttersad, because it's awesome
<roushguy> 1: It was a horse, not a pony.
<DSNesmith> although rainbow's brushable is terrible
<MrMooMoo> Cuddled the screen?
<DSNesmith> the hair is awful
<Turtaguin> I had 2 large mnt dews, like 32oz, this "sleep" thing just... doesn't seem very attractive to me
<Tovler> bah, I can only sleep when sunlight is beaming down
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DvD/Blu-Rays for me
<SuperBrony64> Best solo ever
<LunarFrost> i lost the tab with vinyl scratch
<sotha> You have a Dinky Doo plushy rivets ?
<Darf14> Screw Caffeine, I have good stamina!
<roushguy> 2: No matter how much I want her to be real, Fluttershy will almost certainly not be real
<a041744> I want GOOD plushies, and Pins, and shirts
<RAWRity> so is this at the gala slightly slowed down?
<DSNesmith> the instrumental version of this is better
<Fluttershy> speakin' of caffeine... ate 10 chocolate covered coffee beans at once now am super hyper again and have a head ache ><
<Filter> Robotics
<roushguy> ....
<Filter> we will create
<Tovler> Rainbow Dash loves diamonds? That's weird
<LunarFrost> i wanted to make a reques
<atomic7732> in an infinite universe, she is
<DSNesmith> with the EPIC dash guitar solo
<Mason_Trowel> Wow, to be a downer to yourself.
<LunarFrost> t
<roushguy> That wouldn't be quite the same
<MrMooMoo> Japan.
<Mason_Trowel> *way to
<LunarFrost> another one
<DSNesmith> and no, this is normal speed
<Sumica> Only noobs stack Stamina Darf14 =p
<DSNesmith> almost all remixes speed it up
<atomic7732> or... an infinite mutiverse, at least
<rivets> yeah, I'm trying to get a pattern I like so I got a bunch of cheap grey felt to experiment on. a derpy pegasus and dinky unicorn is the result so far
<VioletVanilla> 6,0It would be. . .
<Darf14> Dang timer, slow down!
<roushguy> Mason: I realize that my fevered fantasies are almost never gonna happen...
<DSNesmith> if they ever release a derpy brushable
<Turtaguin> fluttershy, I ADORE CHOCOLte covered espresso beans!!!!!!!1
<DSNesmith> it will be mine in 10s flat
<ValtheJean> lol, inb4 mod musical podcast
<roushguy> But if they did, I'd be ecstatic.
<RAWRity> it just feels slow compared to the orchestral version I usually watch.
<a041744> Darn it Bronystate, Why U so awesome?!
<DannySwish> DAMNIT clouds...
<roushguy> I set the bar really low so I'm almost never disappointed.
<Fluttershy> Turtaguin: They are the bomb :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because we have ponies :P
<DSNesmith> we try, anon :P
<Thunder_Dash> After listening to so many remixes the original feels slow for me too
<SuperBrony64> If they cancel this show after 2 or 3 seasons HEADS WILL ROLL
<MrMooMoo> Meetoo
<Darf14> I regret stacking my stamina
<Sumica> and the walking animation that freaks me out
<Fluttershy> Turtaguin: but man do they make me hyper ><
<Aponymous> Twilight's expectations for the gala were the least realistic.
<Kencolt> Ohm this prancing is just so CUTE.
<MrMooMoo> It works.
<Mason_Trowel> Once we have working Virtual Reality simulation pods that perfectly simulate fictional dimension and provide vital nourishment and stimuli to your physical body, ANYTHING can be real.
<SummerRain> ooohh.....
<DSNesmith> I think pinkie was the most deluded
<roushguy> True
<Mason_Trowel> Unfortunately, that stuff probably won't exist for another 200 years
*ValtheJean loves Into the Woofs
<ValtheJean> Woods*
<a041744> I have all those shots on my background roatation
<roushguy> If it ever happens
<SummerRain> dang
<Razyn> 0To sell drugs
<SuperBrony64> Awesome song
<wolfinponysclothing> well night everypony
<MrMooMoo> 20 years
<Thunder_Dash> Also, what is RD supposed to be saying there? "Prove I'm great as a Wonderbolt is"?
<Tovler> A cartoon starring quadrupeds? That's different
<MrMooMoo> I bet
<wolfinponysclothing> !moon
<ValtheJean> when At the Gala first played...my face...it was like a lightbulb
<R-Zack> To win!
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, wolfinponysclothing!
<Mason_Trowel> Good night.
<DSNesmith> formal event? sing pony polka
<LunarFrost> yay
<Jervill> blarg?
<Darf14> ?
<atomic7732> get cryogenically freezed so you can be revived for that
<Natleyn> What are we counting down until? o-o
<roushguy> My life will be split equally between being an amazingly powerful hero and living in Equestria
<R-Zack> !?
<DSNesmith> dat latin japanese singing
<SuperBrony64> No Ponies…?
<a041744> a AMV?
<LunarFrost> german
<Reaver021> WHAT.
<Kencolt> Twilight has reasonable expects- but she knew studie not politics.
<RAWRity> SUDDENLY CHANTING
<Tovler> Time to read blurry subtitles
<ValtheJean> 2,14 until Luna goes night night
<SuperBrony64> THAT'S NOT A PONY!!
<Sumica> Wait DCD requested somthing?
<Razyn> 0>hino
<Aponymous> "Royalty is going to ignore a huge party just to talk to ME! and noone else!"
<Natleyn> Awwww.
<R-Zack> Power Ranger or something?
<Razyn> 0>Ankh
<SillyNilly|Vector> Nothing beats the power of imagination. I will take that over some fancy tech any day.
<sotha> This is cool.
*Natleyn hugs Luna
<DSNesmith> reason Luna wasn't at the gala is because she was working
<DSNesmith> Celestia just has to raise the sun and be done with it
<LunarFrost> hugs luna
<Darf14> Dang, if I only have the TARDIS translator
<DSNesmith> Luna has to get all the stars and whatnot up
<Razyn> 0I REQUIRE A LINK TO THIS
<Aponymous> Kamen Rider?
<rivets> poor Fluttershy just wanted to see animals and they were all traumatized by trollestia's terrible animal care
*Thunder_Dash hugs Luna
<Mason_Trowel> You can't cryo freeze yourself with today's technology. The resulting water crystals cause permanent damage to the organs, muscles, and blood vessels.
<Kencolt> Kamen Rider. W?
<a041744> Cool, But.... no its jsut cool
<roushguy> One day I'll be some near-deified warrior, the next I'd be a simple pegasus pony, madly in like with that shy little pegasus with an affinity for animals.
<Fluttershy> LUNA !!! Hi. :3 <3 I FRIGGIN LOVE YA
<SummerRain> i dunno how much longer i can do this
<RAWRity> Man, power rangers has gotten intense since i stopped watching.
<R-Zack> Luna preferred to stay from the Gala at the moment.
<LunarFrost> yes OOO
<DSNesmith> is this.. a kamen rider amv?
*DecapKing glomps Luna
<DSNesmith> OOOS
<SuperBrony64> Since everyone else is doing it...
*SuperBrony64 hugs Luna
<Aponymous> Wait, those are the dudes from OOO!
<atomic7732> well we have games that can read your brainwaves, so if they could convert your thoughts to reality, I'd take that "fancy tech"
<MrMooMoo> But you need something to touch and feel..
<LunarFrost> YUP
<DSNesmith> that hair, I'd recognize it anywhere!
<Mason_Trowel> That's one of the reasons the "Disney froze himself" rumor was debunked.
*TrollightSparkle also hugs Luna
*Tovler stomps Bug
<HaysforPonies> Once virtual reality actually takes off I am going to envy the engineers and programmers. They will make a load of cash.
*rivets isn't sure how to emote in this chat
<rivets> oh good that works
<HaysforPonies> Course this is decades from now at best optimism.
*SuperBrony64 reads Cupcakes for first time
<Mason_Trowel> You won't need cash.
<Natleyn> :3
<DSNesmith> these lyrics are really awful, lol
<MLPGLaDOS> so, what is up next
<SuperBrony64> Can't be that bad...
<R-Zack> Have a good time.
<TrollightSparkle> SuperBrony64 O_O
<VioletVanilla> 6,0What I would really like is to be able to perform, which I could do with my controller...
<Thunder_Dash> My progress on learning Japanese is going well, just about the only word I know off the top of my head is that "unmei" means "fate"
<R-Zack> Inb4 letter spamming
<ValtheJean> but yeah, all we really need is approval from the "upper classmen" and then a few minutes to discuss organization
<DecapKing> that story was pretty funny
<MrMooMoo> Google VR...
<Turtaguin> I swear to god, I am addicted to caffeine, I cannot go to the movies without getting a large mnt dew, and I cannot start my day without a cappeccino, otherwie my movie is ruined, and my day is the shittiest that entire month, respectively
<a041744> Superbrony64, I find cupcakes hilarious, just fyi.
<ValtheJean> ooooohhhh, that would be cool violet
<Razyn> 0TAJADOOOOOOOR
<Reaver021> Oh facebook, you never let me down..
<DSNesmith> reading cupcakes is a rite of passage now
*SuperBrony64 is lying
<Mason_Trowel> If you could get a Virtual Reality pod to live in a simulated dimension of your choice, you can live in a perfect dream society.
<Luna> 07well Sprinks and I are here?
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Unfortunately I have to get that squared away...
<Luna> 07come up with some ideas
<Luna> 07:)
<deoxys> 0Don't read cupcakes. I read it first time two nights ago. It's the worst thing ever.
<R-Zack> Not sure why people find that funny.
<ValtheJean> well, basically what we've been talking about :P
<Fluttershy> Cupcakes, if anything, is something to laugh at.
<Spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrQ-NYIz54&feature=feedu semi- pony related (at the end anyway)
<DecapKing> they try so hard
<R-Zack> Some people even found Sweet Apple Massacre funny.
<Fluttershy> It's not even scary.
<DSNesmith> just get it over with
<DSNesmith> and move on
<SuperBrony64> Cupcakes is very cool, as long as you read the alternate ending where it was all a dream
<ValtheJean> a podcast, or some sort of music related stream like "Guess that Tune"
<Fluttershy> Just ridiculous.
<deoxys> 0It's not funny.
<a041744> I think its so over the top I cant take it seriously
<LunarFrost> most epic kamen rider form ever!!!!1
<HaysforPonies> I can imagine the social and economic effects when people would rather be in a viritual happy world over the real one.
<rivets> I thought it was boring and obvious, tbh
<RAWRity> I feel strange in that I've never felt creeped out by Cupcakes. It just seemed so ridiculous I couldn't be scared. Besides, I've sat through "A Serbian Film", compared to that most things are child's play
<Octavia> 13>"upperclassmen"
*Tovler is contemplating a pony blackout until Next brony movie night.
<Octavia> 13Oh bleh
<ValtheJean> :P
<Aponymous> I've heard about Cupcakes, what's Sweet Apple Massacre about?
<R-Zack> The only reason I laugh at it is that fact it isn't even that interesting.
<Luna> 07oh lol
<Luna> 07did not read that
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I do not think having a radio would be our goal as there would only be pony music just like other sites...
<ValtheJean> I was gona go with "Supreme Overlords" :P
<SuperBrony64> lol must be something involving Applejack
<Luna> 07was just responding :P
<Mason_Trowel> Indeed, it would present a terrible dilemma
<Tovler> Ken Park is worse than Cupcakes
<ValtheJean> but I figured the other was better
<Natleyn> ITT: People diss cupcakes
<Darf14> Never heard of Sweet Apple Massacre
<deoxys> 0No, it's not interesting. It's sick and depressing
<ValtheJean> haha, it's understandable Luna
<Sumica> Dont do it Tovler you will go in to withdraws like House
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Thank you for responding Luna
<Turtaguin> Ive read it over multiple times, not as bad as people say, it basically just explaining how pinkamina slices rainbowdashes parts off of her and making sure shes awake for all of it
<ValtheJean> you're actually, you know, doing stuff :P
<Kencolt> Kamen Rider G. THAT'S awesome. And about wine.
<Luna> 07yep
<RAWRity> I've also seen "I Spit On Your Grave". Compared to a 45 minute rap scene, Cupcakes is nothing.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I for one welcome our pony overlords~
<atomic7732> video game addiction? what? This is virtual reality addiction!
<Turtaguin> and how she does the same to to other ponies
<LunarFrost> TAKA KUJAKU CONDOR
<Luna> 07after this it's playlist
<SummerRain> somepony feed me caffiene
<Darf14> I must find and read it...FOR SCIENCE!
<SuperBrony64> Did someone mention earlier there was a Fluttershy Murder story?
<rivets> I can see how if you've never seen a scary movie before cupcakes might hit you pretty hard, but I would have figured we're all adults and can handle a little gore
<ValtheJean> ah
<Luna> 07Well guys & girls
<a041744> I can't blackout ponies, they have infected every spect of my life
<Luna> 07that was the post - stream
<VioletVanilla> 6,0And sleep... Glorious sleep...
<Thunder_Dash> Cupcakes was really over the top, TBH, and when I kinda realized that it's pretty much Arc 5 of Higurashi with ponies it lost all its impact
<SuperBrony64> Yes Luna?
*MrMooMoo feeds SummerRain milk.
<Luna> 07putting on a playlist now
<MrMooMoo> Oops
*Natleyn hugs Luna again
<Luna> 07hope you all enjoyed
<SuperBrony64> Of My Little Pony?
<Reaver021> Oh, I see. *hugs*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think we should all take this time to show Luna our Appreciation
<Aponymous> I STILL can't believe they remade I Spit on Your Grave.
<Razyn> 0Bye Luna~
*Thunder_Dash hugs Luna again as well
*DecapKing glomps Luna goodbye
<SuperBrony64> WE LOVE YOU LUNA
*roushguy takes a can of Black Mamba-flavored Venom and pours it down SummerRain's throat.
<Sumica> Thanks for Streaming luna
<Natleyn> I wish I could have been here for the movies. :(
<Thunder_Dash> Bye Luna
<deoxys> 0thank you, Luna!
*rivets hugs Luna shyly
<a041744> Ya, the night is still young!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not only for streaming BMN every friday, but also for her wonderful pre/post shows, and of course, the House Stream :P
<atomic7732> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Caffeine_3d_structure.png
<SuperBrony64> Is that enough appreciation?
<Natleyn> Luna's awesome! ;3
<Mason_Trowel> In truth, the simulations would have to be limited simulations. Restricted to X number of hours in a day, so people would still need participate in Reality, that way the world doesn't blow up.
<Turtaguin> WE LOVE YOU AND YOUR SOCKS, LUNA
<Darf14> THNX Luna
<atomic7732> There's some caffeine.
<Reaver021> Thanks Luna! We really do love you! (Except Valthejean, meany ace :D)
<deoxys> 0THANK YOU LUNA!
<Aponymous> Bye Luna!
*RAWRity gives luna an aloof, but still emotional fullfilling nod of the head
<R-Zack> Bye Luna
<ValtheJean> 2,14 HEY!@
<SuperBrony64> Thanks Luna
<Tovler> Take a pony fast. Learn some new recipes. Practice on my Bassoon. Do some long overdue Hurricane debris cleanup
<Turtaguin> tonight, I have 2 best friends
<sotha> YES
<Turtaguin> 1, caffeine for obvious reasons
<SummerRain> thanks? XD
<Kencolt> How can anything be more OOC than this?
<crono_flash> Bye Luna
<DSNesmith> night luna
*SummerRain tries to consume
<SummerRain> it isnt working
<DSNesmith> oh, this video again x.x
<TrollightSparkle> Good night Luna
<atomic7732> but then people would complain that they own their virtual reality machine thingy whatever... and they'd want to be able to use it whenever.
<Tovler> ME: Yeah, I'm gonna get stuff done toda- PONIES: NOPE!
<TrollightSparkle> I'll be back guys.
<sotha> It's true Kencolt.
<Spin> you have to get a cup first silly
<a041744> O.o
<roushguy> Go buy a can
<roushguy> I swear
<Reaver021> ..This song..
<roushguy> that stuff is powerful
<Reaver021> :megusta:
<ValtheJean> but yeah, what are your thoughts on these ideas Luna?
<Turtaguin> 2, hypercam for recording rocky horror for me while I was away :3
<Spin> but it has to be USB compatible
<R-Zack> Dang you ruin my childhood of sesame street.
<MrMooMoo> Drink milk from my udders
<Luna> 07gimme a moment to read up
<SuperBrony64> Ponies don't have free time for work or anything so why should we?!
<rivets> yeah, if you haven't checked out Avenue Q yet, do yourself a favor and do that
<MrMooMoo> I swear
<Luna> 07closing down some things
<ValtheJean> ah kk
<a041744> Not theres anything wrong with that
<MrMooMoo> That stuff is powerful
<SuperBrony64> Who sings these songs?
<roushguy> ...
<Kencolt> Brain hurts.
<DSNesmith> best song in AvQ....
<Darf14> uhh....for some reason it sounds like a Sesame street song...ugh my childhood is dying
<SirSprinkles> 6All dis Avenue Q...
<DSNesmith> sucks to be me or Internet is fp?
<Mason_Trowel> It would be perfect if it could work the way that dreaming does in "Inception". You could just go down into Limbo and construct your own Reality, interacting with the projections of your own subconscious to fill it with life. And should you ever manage to leave, only X number of hours or days will have passed.
<Natleyn> Hiya Sprinkles
<Sumica> What SirSprinkles said.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Nikki and Bert, which is basically Bert and Ernie from Seseme Street :P
<Darf14> o_0
<Reaver021> Darf14, it sounds like that to me too
<crono_flash> What about Internet is for Porn? DSNesmith
<a041744> I thought it was Bert and Ernie at first... haha
<Sumica> also SOFN!
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Nat
<DSNesmith> mentioned it, crono :P
<R-Zack> Jean, you READ MY MIND.
<Kencolt> mY childhood as been MURDERED.
<SuperBrony64> Looks like Avenue Q is done with puppets
<rivets> it's a famous Sesame Street parody, and it is amazing
<Natleyn> My childhood remains safe :3
<Mason_Trowel> Imagine: "Inception,
<Sumica> it is SuperBrony64
<Mason_Trowel> but craft a world of PONY
<DSNesmith> avenue q is strange
<DSNesmith> it's like
<DSNesmith> half puppets
<DSNesmith> half actors
<sotha> What is this?
<Turtaguin> i <3 this song
<rivets> ^ just like Sesame Street
<Turtaguin> hero
<R-Zack> I need a Herroooo!!
<sotha> I like this song. What is it?
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, the mental trauma of actually leaving limbo would be immense.
<R-Zack> Hero
<Tovler> Some kind of ...music?
<rivets> except you can see the actors working the puppets, they're not hidden behind cardboard brick walls or whatever
<R-Zack> hold on
<Turtaguin> by skillet
<MrMooMoo> We just need that machene and connect it to every brony
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Yeah, I was checking out the official site for it. Looks like it's a Broadway musical
<Turtaguin> hero-skillet
<crono_flash> Well I'm heading out, sayonara
<Tovler> oh it IS music
<ValtheJean> 2,14 It is
<R-Zack> The original song is Hero by Skillet.
<a041744> Awesome to the pony degree
<DSNesmith> but some chars aren't puppets
<DSNesmith> brian's just a dude on stage
<Spin> well I am going into a coma until such an invention exists..
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's actually a very clever show
<SummerRain> lol
<Sumica> yep SuperBrony64 they also did the song the internet is for porn.
<DSNesmith> and "everyone's a little bit racist"
<DSNesmith> which is hilarious
<MrMooMoo> Unless its on the cloud!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Plus, it has Gary Coleman as a character :P
<RAWRity> why am I having evanescence flashbacks?
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRrwFzEDinA
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Realistic Minecraft Animation Update
<RoseLuck> yo
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: That's what I thought it sounded like lol
<rivets> ^ just like Sesame street, then, where a bunch of the characters are just actors and not puppets
<Natleyn> RAWRity: You know why.
<MrMooMoo> Yo.
<SirSprinkles> 6This PMV is very well put together.
<DSNesmith> really?
<FluffyWuffs> hey, there's ponibooru.org too?
<SuperBrony64> I remember that time I won dinner for two in Mexico with GARY COLEMAN
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is a seseme street parody
<DSNesmith> honestly I haven't watched SS since I was 5
<SodapopFizz> Blah, almost 2am for me. I should get to bed. Take care everypony.
<Sumica> I saw it when it was out here in Vegas
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they have monitors on the side of the theater, which does little parodies of the Seseme Street transition scense
<DSNesmith> I remember nothing
<Reaver021> HEY GUYS, AM I A KNIFE, OR A BANANA?
<FluffyWuffs> it loads surprisingly fast
<Natleyn> Sleep well, SodapopFizz :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's literally Adult Seseme Street
<atomic7732> If we don't destroy ourselves, some day maybe we will be able to bring the dead back to life to experience what they missed in technological advancements, and then somehow solve over-population...
<a041744> I dont think i ever really watched Seaseme street. /:
<rivets> the first couple episodes of classic Sesame Street were amazing
<RAWRity> I have only the vaguest of memories of sesame street
<Darf14> Its been way too long since I saw SS, is it true that Cookie Monster eats veggies now?
<RAWRity> same with Barney
<rivets> it was more obviously about life in the NYC ghetto
<DSNesmith> I think they retconned that a bit
<DSNesmith> with cookie monster
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, and Burt and Ernie don't live together anymore
<MrMooMoo> Is poniborru.com
<Mason_Trowel> Imagine spending 50 years in an Equestria you have brought into existence in the depths of your subconscious. Living every moment of every day for decades as a pony amongst ponies...and then, something pulls you from limbo. You awake as a human in a world you cannot stand to look at, the beauty of your Equestria lost.
<MrMooMoo> ?
<atomic7732> but with technology to bring people back to life, I'm sure that society would be able to solve over-population easily
<RAWRity> valthejean WHAT. BLASPHEMY.
<SummerRain> what is borru for?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because people bitched that they were teaching kids that gay couples are okay
<RAWRity> RUINED FOREVER
<Tovler> yeah, and Meowth is no longer with Team Rocket
<ValtheJean> 2,14 welcome to American Soccer Moms
<SuperBrony64> Reaver021, are those the only two options?
<Sumica> Is the count still a pimp?
<SummerRain> how would we solve over-population then?
<Turtaguin> I am legitametly high on caffeine, not just having ingested like <100 mg, like over 350-400 what should I watch/do????
<a041744> Tolerance... how dare they!
<Darf14> *monicle* dam you over protective parents! DAM YOU!
<rivets> yeah, how dare they insinuate that different lifestyles can be tolerated
<DSNesmith> lol turtaguin
<Spose> My fellow bronies.
<Luna> 07alright.. so where should I start?
<Spose> I require aid,.
<RAWRity> tovler and my childhood is officially dead.
<FluffyWuffs> pack our bags, travel to mars :D
<Mason_Trowel> Yes?
<MrMooMoo> Kill prisoners.
<Spin> Yes Spose?
<FluffyWuffs> heya spose
<Fluttershy> ......................
<ValtheJean> probably at "DO IT FILLY!" (lol j/k)
<atomic7732> idk let people in the future figure it out. We wouldn't have the technology to solve it
<a041744> Curse you college sleep schedule!
<Fluttershy> I have... a song stuck in my head...
<Mason_Trowel> Spose calls for aid!
<FluffyWuffs> MrMooMoo: Also acceptable
<Razyn> 0Shoo shoo bee doo
<Spose> I've been playing my xbox more often recently and I want to change my motto to reflect my new bronyism.
<ValtheJean> there's a thread about this on the forum as well
<Sumica> Is it the song that never ends?
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy: which song?
<Spose> 21 characters.
<Natleyn> What is it this time, Fluttershy?
<SirSprinkles> 6EPIC PMV INCOMING
<SirSprinkles> 6...DAT RING
<Turtaguin> have yuo seen the new friendship is witchcraft?
<Natleyn> THIS PMV
<DSNesmith> haven't seen this one before
<DSNesmith> what is this
<Fluttershy> backwards song of time from Majora's mask...
<Spose> I can't think of anything to put.
<Tovler> yeah, and Team Rocket is competent and no longer stalking Ash.
<MrMooMoo> Love and Tolerate?
<FluffyWuffs> ^this
<ValtheJean> but basically what are your thoughts on us doing something like that, is there a timeslot we could reserve or something, any suggestions? Basically any input on the subject
<Spin> "Grudge rhymes with fudge"
<DSNesmith> this is a good beginning...
<Thunder_Dash> Song of Healing reversed. THAT IS ALL
<DSNesmith> vaguely familiar
<FluffyWuffs> "Oatmean, y u serious?"
<Darf14> wait, if it ring does that mean the timer hit zero?
<MrMooMoo> 20% cooler.
<rivets> oh hurray, actual lipsynching
<Tovler> and Brock is no longer on the show.
<Spose> Love and tolerate is a good one. Like yours too FluffyWuffs.
<Tovler> timer hits 0 on the hour
<R-Zack> Wow
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…I liked Luna's Chrome theme with Applejack and want to put it on my laptop…but….then it would be on my laptop…which I bring to college...
<Aponymous> No Brock? What the FUCK!?
<atomic7732> I'd go with 20% cooler
<Fluttershy> da da da da da da da da...
<Turtaguin> ohhh, this is a combo of a few songs i think
<SunshineSmiles> Hey
<FluffyWuffs> yeah 20% cooler is the obvious choice
<MrMooMoo> Your going to LOVE ME.
<Razyn> 0SuperBrony64 do it filly
<Spose> I tried putting 20% cooler. Didn't look right.
<Natleyn> It is.
<a041744> I do like good music...
<Turtaguin> yup
<RAWRity> stuff like this always makes me cringe a bit, just because I'm not a fan of bring up sex in the same breath as ponies.
<atomic7732> meh
<sotha> What's wrong with bringing ponies to college?
<FluffyWuffs> :/
<Spose> lol not sure if that will fit Mr.MooMoo
<DSNesmith> Katy Perry, oh, dear
<Spin> ~yay
<R-Zack> Eeyup, give that part to Rainbow Dash
<Thunder_Dash> Why am I not surprised that RD's the one who showed up with that song?
<a041744> Superbrony64, Fluant your Bronydom man!
<DSNesmith> SuperBrony64, bring the desktop and never give a fuck forever
<SuperBrony64> Razyn Thanks Random Internet Stranger, I will do it now!
<Darf14> RD Confessed!
<Mongoose> Night
<DSNesmith> seriously
<Tovler> And Ash is traveling with a cute black girl.
<R-Zack> Dash, because of the fandom.
<Mason_Trowel> Good night
<DSNesmith> I was unsure about bringing my pony collection
<Spin> night mongoose
<Colgate> hello
<Spose> Night mongoose
<DSNesmith> I brought it anyway
<DSNesmith> no regrets
<Natleyn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irQ_d78feMA
<Filter> night
<MrMooMoo> Drink Milk!
<rivets> poor bicurious dash, sounding vaguely like katy perry just seals your fate
<Natleyn> ^It's the PMV we're watching.
<R-Zack> Well, imma go. Bye!
<SunshineSmiles> Hey there
<ValtheJean> >mfw you've already replied to the thread >.< *d'oh*
<RAWRity> tovler I'm alright with this, I liked Isis in the games
<Natleyn> Night R-Zack!
<SuperBrony64> I'm still at Stage 3 of being a Brony :(
<Spin> "get bucked!"?
<DSNesmith> lol fluttershy's face
<Thunder_Dash> Night Zack
<DSNesmith> euw
<FluffyWuffs> yeah, ponibooru.org is 20% faster
<SuperBrony64> The Super in my name is all LIES
<DSNesmith> spin me round remix
<DSNesmith> er
<DSNesmith> cover
<Darf14> Night R-Zack
<DSNesmith> the orignal is way better
<Tovler> Iris is the cutest thing ever.
<MrMooMoo> Yay.
<FluffyWuffs> NO MORE LAGGG
<DSNesmith> man my tping's getting worse thelater I stay up
<ValtheJean> but yeah, I've gone through DcD's guides, not sure if I actually got it right, but I at least have the software
<DSNesmith> wow
<Aponymous> FLO RIDA CAN BURN IN A FIRE!
<Spose> Ponibooru is way faster lately.
<RAWRity> i'm at whatever stage of Bronydom it is that you like it, you watch and read fan stuff, but you don't talk to your friends about it.
<Mason_Trowel> "But I want it NAOO!"
<ValtheJean> but if someone else wants to take the mantle that's also fine
<FireFly> Hey everyone ^_^
<a041744> Soon you wont care and carry around RD cutie mark on your backpack like me.
<DSNesmith> I don't push it on my friends
<DSNesmith> but if they mention ponies
<Spose> Hiya Firefly.
<FluffyWuffs> It's better than ponibooru.net
<DSNesmith> the floodgates open
<SuperBrony64> Stage 3: Closet Brony RAWRity
<Tovler> FLO RIDA is still in the club? Isn't he 40?
<FluffyWuffs> hiya firefly
<Mason_Trowel> 21 characters.
<atomic7732> yay wouldn't seem right imo, on the playstation my text said yay last year before the whole bronyism thing came up. I only put that cause at that time I had nothing else to say
<Natleyn> DSN: Same
<Spose> You have any ideas Firefly for my gamertag motto?
<MrMooMoo> I'd like to be a tree.
<Thunder_Dash> How many stages are there, exactly?
<SuperBrony64> Stage 4, is like acceptance and letting your friends know
<Spose> The 21 characters is why its hard.
<FluffyWuffs> So would I
<RAWRity> like I straight up don't care about strangers seeing it, but my friends are rather...closeminded when it comes to consuming media. The actually think Transformers 2 was GOOD.
<SuperBrony64> Stage 5 is mega crazy brony
<Tovler> I try to be non-chalant about my bronyism. I don't want to overhype the show.
<ForeverOdin> Hmm.
<Spose> "Oatmeal, y u serious" is 20. Like really.
<roushguy> I'm overly obsessed with the idea of Fluttershy now....
<DSNesmith> rawrity: disregard uncultured buffoons, acquire new friends
<Natleyn> My sister came over, and I'm not sure she noticed, even though chrome theme + desktop BG + phone + wearing Rainbow Dash Pin
<roushguy> I want a plushie.
<SuperBrony64> You wear nothing but brony merchandise and quote the show every single moment you can
<Thunder_Dash> I think I'm somewhere between 4 and 5
<roushguy> :(
*ValtheJean would feel more comfortable if someone else said something >.<
<Spose> Can't believe how expensive the plushies are.
<Razyn> 0Bye Everypony. Sleepy time
<roushguy> How much?
<a041744> The show is awesome, the fandom makes in incredible
<FireFly> "I'm a brony, deal with it!"
<deoxys> 0YES
<deoxys> 0YES YES YES
<FireFly> lol
<HaysforPonies> I want allllllll the high quality custom Fluttershys. All of them.
<SuperBrony64> Night Razyn
<rivets> your friends thought Transformers 2 was good? unfriend imo
<Natleyn> Night Razyn
<deoxys> 0NINE INCH NAILS FTW
<RAWRity> they're nice people and all, but they're still in that stage where they think liking "little kid" stuff is stupid.
<Spin> like 150$ last I checked
<Reaver021> G'night Razyn
<Spose> The one that was on EQD was 65
<roushguy> I just want one.
<roushguy> O.O
<Aponymous> Night Razyn.
<MrMooMoo> On My PSN its bronies are EVERYWHERE.
<DSNesmith> >middle school
<roushguy> Too much.
<SunshineSmiles> So
<SunshineSmiles> Hey
<Darf14> Still on stage 3, Open to you guys, but not to anyone outside the net, if they know my older brother will kick my rear end
<Thunder_Dash> Night, Razyn.
<SunshineSmiles> How long you guys been around?
<SuperBrony64> I decided I shouldn't give a damn, but I won't flaunt it
<Mason_Trowel> "But I want it NAOO!" is good if you like Applebloom.
<TuxRug> roushguy: I would love to give Fluttershy a hug :)
<ForeverOdin> The cheapest one I've seen thus far is 65 haha
*roushguy bursts into a ludicrous amount of tears.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Where is the streaming tutorial?
<DSNesmith> I don't flaunt it but I gladly discuss it
<FluffyWuffs> I want a plushie Luna
<ValtheJean> on the forum
<FluffyWuffs> and Twilight
<ValtheJean> I'll link it
<DSNesmith> it's hard to tell people what I love about the show though
<FireFly> lol apple family is the shit
<Turtaguin> like this song
<Reaver021> I got over it. Of course, one of my best friends absolutely hates Ponies.
<rivets> >the plot
<Spin> Hasbro Y U NO MAKE OFFICIAL PLUSSHIES?
<DSNesmith> "it's got great acting! great animation! good writing!"
<Darf14> Its like PPG All over with me again
<MrMooMoo> I want show accurate Twilight anything.
<FireFly> Cause they are too lazy
<FluffyWuffs> iknorite
<Tovler> I'm stage... 3?
<DSNesmith> "no, seriously, why do you watch it?"
<Spose> I was thinking "Something with Luna, my favorite" then I'm like "...Luna has about 3 lines in the entire show"
<RAWRity> Though they do know that I've watched the show. I did a review of "Cupcakes" and mentioned that I'd decided to watch a few episodes to see what the hype was about
<DSNesmith> "..." *facehoof*
<VioletVanilla> 6,0As I said, I should have everything to stream music or desktop kind of things. . . but like Luna there will be
<Ali1017> Hasbro, why you no make show accurate ponies!
<FireFly> I am making my own plusshies at the moment XD
<FluffyWuffs> pft, wait till s2
<Tovler> I'm more interested in the fandom than the actual show.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Nothing from my lips
<Spose> srsly
<RAWRity> which is true enough, i just didn't mention that I'd then proceeded to watch the rest of the episodes.
<Awesomeshy> not long
<SuperBrony64> I put down MLP about two weeks ago :(
<Sketchy_Sounds> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:07h:00m:45s
<Colgate> I've only been here a day myself
<RAWRity> and love them all.
<Spose> Hasbro is not cashing in on us fast enough.
<Reaver021> My facebook was the first thing to alert people to my..addiction.
<FluffyWuffs> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<FluffyWuffs> asdfghjkl
<Awesomeshy> we've been open for testing for about 2 now
<SuperBrony64> Now I'm a mega fan
<ValtheJean> :P
<deoxys> 0quick question. was it explained full on that celestia had pink hair in her younger days?
<ForeverOdin> I can't wait till the day I see a Pony plushie in one of the Claw Machines. Actually, maybe not, because I'd probably fork out $25 trying to get that thing. >_>
<DSNesmith> lol
<Awesomeshy> or has it only been a day
<FluffyWuffs> thats a lot of muffins XD
<MrMooMoo> Dammit we missed 777777
<atomic7732> wait... we missed the 7 7 7 7
<SunshineSmiles> Ahh
<DSNesmith> I started dropping pony phrases on fb
<DSNesmith> most people didn't catch on
<atomic7732> fail
<Thunder_Dash> I was pretty tempted to flaunt it when the school year started, but I kinda... Well, didn't
<roushguy> I'd just smash the glass, take my Fluttershy, and leave.
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<ValtheJean> >mfw I can't find the tutorials anymore
<Ali1017> !mail DerpyBot 1.21 Gigamuffins
<Spin> ForeverOdin:I would be going to jail for that plushies
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<Ali1017> yes
<DSNesmith> not going to use a pony as an avatar though, I can't stand people who put fictional chars as their facebook profile pics
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Ali1017
<FluffyWuffs> omg
<Tovler> o wait. The new episode screenshot every day... I guess I won't fast from ponies afterall.
<ForeverOdin> Haha
<Octavia> 13I still want the idea of everyone doing a podcast together. But its hard to get even most of everyone together at any given point.
<a041744> I drop in pony wherever I can, most people dont care.
<SunshineSmiles> Well welcome to the IRC business
<ValtheJean> yeah
<FluffyWuffs> you gave Derpy too many :c?
<roushguy> T.T
<Reaver021> I don't really need sleep, but I don't wanna sleep. I'll be playing fallout 3 if anypony needs me.
<DSNesmith> news?j
<SuperBrony64> I'm putting it as my YouTube avatar
<SuperBrony64> 
<DSNesmith> TO EQD
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Set This Pony Down, I Smell Soft News! (http://tinyurl.com/3rnp3o2)
<Aponymous> Me neither DSN, that always bugged me.
<Awesomeshy> y thank u
<Octavia> 13But could try and work something out.
<Natleyn> My current profile picture is a garden gnome with the caption "How about I slap your shit?"
<sotha> I don't post pony quotes on fb because I don't post posts period, but I did have a few different cutie marks as my picture (Octavia's, then Twilights, and I have a couple MLP references in my profile info, and I have quite a few different pony pages liked.
<SirSprinkles> >streaming tutorials
<SunshineSmiles> We have the other PonyIRC
<SirSprinkles> >in the STREAMER section
<SirSprinkles> If you start streaming, I'll give access to it. XD
<ValtheJean> >can't see any such section
<Mason_Trowel> Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
<RAWRity> tovler YOU'LL NEVER ESCAPE THEIR GRASP
<Octavia> 13I also know though not everyone is comfortable talking into a mic, which makes me sad.
<Awesomeshy> which one? I was told that there were two others including us
<FireFly> I want season two to be NOW!
<ValtheJean> lol, well that's kinda circular :P
<Mason_Trowel> Peter S. Beagle is a BRONY?!
<Awesomeshy> imean
<Awesomeshy> excluding
<Mason_Trowel> YES!
<ValtheJean> >you can stream if you read the tutorial
<DSNesmith> that news article confuses me
<FireFly> lol my text is all red XD
<ValtheJean> >you can't see the tutorial unless you start streaming
<SunshineSmiles> Only one other
<SunshineSmiles> Just us and you
<Sumica> Oh my, some one did a pony version Of Nichijou?
<DannySwish> how do you do bold?
<TuxRug> like this
<Furril> http://i.imgur.com/AVFSO.jpg
<DannySwish> bb
<FireFly> hit the R button
<TuxRug> ctrl+b
<ValtheJean> but again, I have the software set up, I'd just need to test it out at some point :P
<Ali1017> Turn off bold
<HaysforPonies> What.
<DannySwish> buahahahahah
<sotha> My current avatar is from Hourou Musuko.
<SunshineSmiles> Seth typoed your info on EqD
<SunshineSmiles> Well
<FireFly> then there are settings
<Furril> You go bold by purchasing it at the stor.
<SuperBrony64> I don't think Hasbro could cancel the show now even if they wanted to
<Whimsical> *About to have seziure*
<Thunder_Dash> I don't even USE my Facebook anymore, haha.
<a041744> I never use FB anymore. I don't care about these people I never see.
<Octavia> dont do bold
<Awesomeshy> haha yeah
<DSNesmith> why would they want to
<DannySwish> for me its command d
<FireFly> what store?
<sotha> And the two avatars before that were both from Hourou Musuko.
<DSNesmith> I want to see some sales figures on the toy line
<SunshineSmiles> Well
<Awesomeshy> I emailed him about it and he said he'd re do it next time
<Tovler> heck it took me a 2 months to start using my actual online handle here. I'm not quite ready to embrace them.
<DannySwish> i mean command b
<Ali1017> Bold off now FireFly
<SunshineSmiles> Okay
<Spin> wiener
<SuperBrony64> Everyone on the internet would go apeshit on Hasbro if they did it
<FireFly> fine
<FireFly> no fun
<SunshineSmiles> Well, I wish you well
<TuxRug> oh dear.
<Natleyn> If they did
<Natleyn> WE would make it
<DannySwish> Dumdeedumdeedummm
<Darf14> did what?
<ValtheJean> it's so hard getting used to not being able to see everything on a zetaboards I frequent :P
<DannySwish> cool.
<SuperBrony64> They would have to reinstate the show again as soon as they cancel it
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK listen up
<DSNesmith> I actually decided to change my online handle about two days before I first found out about ponies
<ValtheJean> so this is what it feels like to be mortal
<Thunder_Dash> Pretty much
<Sketchy_Sounds> When we say don't use bold
<DSNesmith> then I got hooked
<Turtaguin> I feel like I could watch a blank wall for hours
<sotha> If they canceled the show, the world would end and an interdimensional rift would open, and something like TCB would happen.
<Sketchy_Sounds> That means, "don't use bold".
<DSNesmith> and DSNesmith has become pony-focused
<Aponymous> Getting replaced by Ashton Kutcher, WINNING.
<Awesomeshy> you too
<a041744> I just 041744 for everything, but you can't start your name with number here
<Darf14> WINNING!
<Sketchy_Sounds> It does not mean "Everyone use bold now!"
<SuperBrony64> I hate FB
<Darf14> The Charlie Sheen way
<Turtaguin> I have that much going on in my head right now
<SunshineSmiles> Hmm
<Sketchy_Sounds> Thank you.
<SunshineSmiles> Okay
<SunshineSmiles> I have an idea
<DSNesmith> applequest!
<SunshineSmiles> Okay
<FireFly> O_O
*TuxRug knew that was going to happen.
<Spin> Okie Dokie Lokie
<Awesomeshy> Okay
<DannySwish> Who said "Don't use bold" ? I was looking at my keyboard
<SunshineSmiles> In the best intrest of IRC's
<Tovler> The animators seem to be worked to the bone. I hope they don't quit.
<Lordlyhour|2> Wow
<SunshineSmiles> Ill pm you
<Spose> totally.
<Awesomeshy> alright
<DSNesmith> hope they get a break
<MrMooMoo> Someones angry..
<SuperBrony64> People think they are so technologically inclined just because they know how to open IE and use FaceBook
<a041744> Darn it ponies, Is there nothing you dont go with ?
<Ali1017> It's annoying
<TuxRug> DannySwish: Ali1017 did, multiple times
<FluffyWuffs> bold gets annoyinh
<Lordlyhour|2> Seriously? Stupid KVIrc
<ForeverOdin> As did Octavia
<Darf14> I hope they don't kill themselves over it
<Ali1017> And it's not just Sketchy_Sounds that is aggrivated
<Fluttershy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8V_rs6e7E
<a041744> I feel sorry for people who use IE
<SirSprinkles> Val... once we have an APPROVED reason to let you stream, we'll give you access to the streamer section.
<MrMooMoo> I cant see it much on colloquy..
<RAWRity> a041744 they dont go with G3.5
<FireFly> i just got in here so i didnt know
<sotha> What is the meaning of 041744 for you?
<DannySwish> Oh I see OCtavia said it once
<Natleyn> Fluttershy: Yay :3
<Furril> http://i.imgur.com/vrTPS.jpg
<DSNesmith> IE? this is 2011, mate
<DannySwish> Oh yeah and Ali did too
<Tovler> It's bad enough that Lauren is done with the show. (she'll have a child by the time Season 3 goes into production)
<SirSprinkles> We just don't want new mods streaming unapproved stuff at some random time.
<Darf14> Agreen, IE is the most unsecured browser
<DannySwish> oh you have colloquy too?
<roushguy> Geez.
<DSNesmith> WO
<SuperBrony64> I love that video Fluttershy
<Natleyn> Whoo
<DSNesmith> BEST PONY TIME
<roushguy> Ever since I discovered ponies...
<MrMooMoo> For ipod.
<Fluttershy> ^^
<roushguy> I've been acting weird.
<RAWRity> ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff this song
<Lordlyhour> Bloody IRC changed my name to Lordlyhour|2
<FluffyWuffs> Twilight RAGE!!!!!
*Natleyn highhooves DSNesmith
<a041744> 041744 was my school id for 12 years, so it just stuck, I like the flow of the number
<DSNesmith> >suddenly this song became tolerable and even good
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's basically just extremely annoying when the room's collective IQ takes a huge dip every so often.
<SirSprinkles> 6This song sucks... this PMV is good though.
<FluffyWuffs> Because everyone knows Twilight Sparkle>Twilight
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqdaKZW48KU :P
<ForeverOdin> Weird in what way(s)?
<Lordlyhour> Ah. Its lost my connection
<Aponymous> Rarity has done the impossible, she made this song sorta tolerable.
<SuperBrony64> Hopefully we're cool with posting videos now :/
<FireFly> .... Question am I the only one that has the my little pony app for the ipod here?
<Natleyn> I'm with sprinkles.
<roushguy> I mean, I've gone from being overly cautious about nobody finding out...
<SirSprinkles> 6Requests go in #Vinyl_Scratch
<DSNesmith> before ponies: wtf is this shit
<SirSprinkles> 6Not here
<roushguy> To bawling my eyes out
<MrMooMoo> I got pony sounds.
<AllisZero> Sorry no
<Spin> App? What App?
<DSNesmith> after ponies: singing this song loudly at 2 in the morning
<roushguy> And now I'm obsessed with Fluttershy.
<atomic7732> FluffyWuffs: but... Twilight is an awesome owl...
<Darf14> were still doing request, cool
<AllisZero> I hate that song
<FluffyWuffs> wat
<DannySwish> LOL @ Twilight Poneez
<SuperBrony64> We still doing request?!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway. I'm sleep-deprived and beginning to get massively snarky, so I'll spare you all my nastiness and go get the sleep I need.
<Octavia> 13Wait a minute...
<SirSprinkles> 6If we are. *shrug*
<AllisZero> It has everything I hate about modern society in it
<sotha> I see. Mine was 020601416, which is not very good username material. That being said, one of my party members in a MMO I played had the name of 85456, which I took for myself.
<FireFly> Spin there is an app called my little pony pro
<SirSprinkles> 6Either way, no vid links in this room.
<Octavia> 13I didnt even notice until you mentioned it, but yeah, its missing now for me too...
<ForeverOdin> Have a good night Sketchy. Sleep well
<Mason_Trowel> Good night
<DannySwish> Oh, bye!
<SuperBrony64> I thought Luna just put her computer on a continuous playlist
<Spin> G'night Sketch
*FluffyWuffs facehoofs atomic7732
<atomic7732> Guardians of Ga'Hoole
<SuperBrony64> :<
<Spose> Fluttershy is awesome. Of course your obsessed.
<FireFly> IT HAS EVERYTHING!
<Furril> Futashy stop that, Im trying to draw.
<ValtheJean> reorganization :P
<Natleyn> ^That
<Natleyn> Luna's AFK or something.
<Spin> DO WANT
<SirSprinkles> It's because only streamers have access to the new section.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Merci
<Mason_Trowel> I don't own an ipod
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, no more requests for tonight
<Spose> I'm addicted to Depeche Mode atm.
<DannySwish> 0__0
<MrMooMoo> Good night! Drink Milk!
<Octavia> 13I didnt even get the read the guide...
<DannySwish> lol
<FireFly> fluttershy is ok but i rather have applejack or rainbow dash
<Lordlyhour> Really?
<Lordlyhour> OR?
<FluffyWuffs> its 2am here. I'm just not feeling tired at all... Then again, it's also Friday
<SirSprinkles> lol doesn't matter because you don't need to stream anything?
<Lordlyhour> I'd rather have them ALL!
*Octavia 13sighs
<deoxys> 0So, I missed the movies and episodes tonight I guess? I turned on the site at like, 11:40...was I too late?
<Spose> I like all the mane 6, but fluttershy is my second favorite.
<DSNesmith> lol, rather, yes
<Spose> And I never get tired of her.
<Octavia> 13I was thinking about it...
<SuperBrony64> So, is Friday Movie Night the only schedule for this chat? Any other special events that occur during the week?
<MrMooMoo> 11pm here!
<AllisZero> I am off to sleep gentlecolts, see you all tomorrow.
<Turtaguin> yup
<Octavia> 13I have the hardware
<DSNesmith> hey has anyone played the new Space Marine game?
<deoxys> 0sh
<Turtaguin> bye!
<FluffyWuffs> hey Fireant
<Synros> ok Im back
<ValtheJean> well, that's why we just petition for a spot
<deoxys> 0ah*
<DSNesmith> night
<Lordlyhour> 4:05 here
<ForeverOdin> I want a Derpy Plush. ^-^
<roushguy> Not for me....
<roushguy> For me
<Thunder_Dash> See ya, Allis
<Lordlyhour> in the afternoon
<Natleyn> Makes me sad that I can find desktop-monitor-keyboard packages at WALMART of all places that have triple the stats of my computer, for half what it was bought for T^T
<Synros> that was a good breakfast
<roushguy> Fluttershy is perfect.
<SuperBrony64> Night Alliszero
<Lordlyhour> Hi fireant
<Octavia> 13I;ve been here a while and I'
<ValtheJean> if it's approved, we get access. Seems fair to me
<Natleyn> Hiya Rynros.
<a041744> I usually find numbers for usernames a bit hard to remember, but I guess im just being a bit hypocrtical over here.
<FluffyWuffs> Rarity is the best pony!
<Tovler> Don't forget to thank Sumica again for streaming Season 2 beginning next Saturday.
<Natleyn> Night Alliszero :3
<Fireant> Hello minions!
<Lordlyhour> I am getting a derpy plush
<MrMooMoo> Pacific coast FTW.
<roushguy> I try to be calm, but I often lose my temper...
<SirSprinkles> 6I literally just said that if we approve your for streaming whatever... i.e. an idea, as a backup, etc., I'll give access.
<DSNesmith> woo, sumica
<roushguy> I love animals to death
<Spose> FluffyWuffs, you misspelled Twilight.
<SuperBrony64> I remember buying my first computer build
<Octavia> 13*I've talked about it before, I shouldnt have to partition for it.
<atomic7732> MrMooMoo: totally
<FluffyWuffs> minions? No I am your slave
<Darf14> Which Space Marine game? Halo, Star Craft, seriously which one?
<FluffyWuffs> Spose: Blasphemy
<DSNesmith> x.x
<DSNesmith> Space marine
<DSNesmith> as in
<RAWRity> well, that was unpleasant
<atomic7732> Do we have to like... talk about the best pony like 5 times a day?
<DSNesmith> 40k
<SuperBrony64> AMD Athlon 64 3700+ w/ 1 GB RAM and GeForce 6200
<MrMooMoo> Ponies are the best Pony.
<DSNesmith> real space marines
<SirSprinkles> 6When did you say you wanted to stream?
<Lordlyhour> Yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<SuperBrony64> Powerful beast
<Octavia> 13Several times.
<roushguy> And I really should just come out and admit that I've completely fallen in love with her.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh yes
<roushguy> sigh
<Octavia> 13And I had access to it before.
<Spin> Current order (it changes ALOT) 1.Pinkie Pie 2. Rainbow Dash 3.Fluttershy 4.Twilight 5.Rarity 6.Applejack
<Lordlyhour> we do have to talk about the best pony AT LEAST 5 times a day
<ValtheJean> 2,14 giant robots....me gusta
<ForeverOdin> BLU PONY
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony had access to it before.
<Natleyn> Wat
<Darf14> Oh I remember this from brony movie night 2
<RAWRity> ON NO, HE HURT LUNA
<Spose> I'm only talking about the mane 6.
<Natleyn> I like, but wat
<SirSprinkles> 6Because it was disorganized.
<SillyNilly|Vector> !link big_macintosh
<Spose> My two favorites are backround characters.
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52991
<SuperBrony64> What game is this?
<SirSprinkles> 6I moved it so new mods can't see it.
<Darf14> wow, I have a dam good memory
<Octavia> 13But I'm in the middle of a move, I cant stream right now. So I was waiting until after my move.
<FireFly> i dont like pinkie pie all that much
<HaysforPonies> Fluttershy is always my first. Second is random but right now it's RD.
<TuxRug> I still have Dash and Fluttershy tying for first
<atomic7732> okay then... out of all: Imbri and mane 6: Rainbow Dash
<MrMooMoo> I love them all.
<Octavia> 13>new mods
<Lordlyhour> Current order: 1:Vinylscratch and Derpy
<Lordlyhour> Every other pony?
<Thunder_Dash> OH YES THIS VIDEO
<Lordlyhour> They can go awway and form a foreground for those 2
<DSNesmith> what is THIS?
<MrMooMoo> But i love twi more...
<a041744> THIS IS THE AWSOME
<ValtheJean> not new mods, non-streamers
<SirSprinkles> 6I literally give access to everypony on an individual basis.
<Darf14> Yes this VID...but with no AJ
<Ali1017> Twilight!!
<Thunder_Dash> DSN; Amazing, that's what. :P
<FluffyWuffs> Eh, I kinda like Lyra, BerryPunch, and Octavia more than other BG ponies
<RAWRity> suddenly communism
<a041744> The complete history of russia to tetris
<ForeverOdin> I agree completel Lordly
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<ForeverOdin> completely*
<Spose> 1 is Vinyl. 2 is Luna. 3 is Octavia. 4 is Twilight. 5 is Trixie. 6 is fluttershy.
<SillyNilly|Vector> Very nice. Thank you Derpy.
<SillyNilly|Vector> !plot
<sotha> I love you, Sumica~
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Natleyn> Rawr, exactly
<DSNesmith> russian history is depressing
<SillyNilly|Vector> Oh my.
<SuperBrony64> Can't wait for Season 2 :D
<MrMooMoo> And I love vinyl but i dont know her well..
<HaysforPonies> For BG pony that's Octavia for me.
<FireFly> Big mac is an awesome character :D
<Sumica> Eh what did i do?
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, if you have a reason to use it, you'll get access to it.
<RAWRity> Russia in general is depressing
<DSNesmith> serfdom, mongol invasion, crappy kingdom, crappier soviet union
<ForeverOdin> Eeeeyup
<Darf14> Russia already ruled the world with a weapon called Tetris
<a041744> less than 7 days till season 2 woooo
<Spin> I find it hard to use background ponies as favorites due to lack of air time if its based off color schemes I'd say Scratch and Colgate
<Thunder_Dash> Ironically, I learned more from this one video than I did from an entire year of Socials class
<SirSprinkles> 6I just don't feel like changing forum masks for people.
<FluffyWuffs> Big Mac needs more screen time in s2
<Turtaguin> OH GOD MY BRAIN IS TRYING TO STAB MY STOMACHE, AND MY STOMACHE IS STABBING MY LOWER DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
<FluffyWuffs> and lines!
<Spose> Theres nothing to really love about backround ponies unless you read fanfiction to give them depth.
*Octavia would get Twilight every book in the universe just to snuggle her for an evening.
<Tovler> It's more than 7 days for me
<Octavia> 13I thought as a mod I was able to look into streaming at any point.
<FireFly> Yes he does
<SirSprinkles> 6You are.
<roushguy> Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, Rarity.
<Thunder_Dash> *more about Russia, I mean
<SuperBrony64> Believe it or not, the CIA thought that Tetris was a threat to America. They believed it was an advanced military mental training program for their soldiers.
<Spose> Course Vynl is just awesome.
<Turtaguin> FUCK, CAFFEINE WHY D YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT AFTER AN AMAZING HIGH
<Octavia> 13And I'm not even a new mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<Octavia> 13Oi.
<Spin> I hope they have more Vinyl in S2
<Trot_Rot> I just got lost in youtube land
<ValtheJean> to be fair, the reorganization is kinda needed, especially now that we have a distinction between mods and streamers
<MrMooMoo> I just love Twilights and Vinyls mane.
<Octavia> 13Well, I need a copy of DCD's guide still.
<Spose> I like how refined yet pretty Octavia is.
<Aponymous> Tetris always bored me.
<Lordlyhour> Thats the entire REASON background ponies are awesoemn
<Lordlyhour> WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM
<DSNesmith> so is this all of russian history or just the revolution
<ForeverOdin> roushguy: Switch Twilight and Applejack and you have my list ha
<Sumica> At the same time SuperBrony64 they also thought furbys were too.
<SuperBrony64> Twilight Sparkle loves Tetris
<Mason_Trowel> I'm really angry at my brother and roommates right now... >.<
<Darf14> Wait, our real life CIA thought of that?! Wow our intelligence is not that smart.
<sotha> I just wanted to see if you could be stirred from your lull, Sumica. What are you up to?
<Spose> I like Luna because she dealt with crippling lonliness and hate for a thousand years.
<roushguy> Well
<SuperBrony64> Well, in contrast, Furbys were a real threat
<roushguy> twilight/applejack are sorta tied.
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Lordlyhour> thusy, if we want them to be Ninja JEdi Cheerleader Timetravelling Bears in disguise, they CAN be
<MrMooMoo> I just love purple..
<DSNesmith> furbies...
<SirSprinkles> 6It's less that and more of the fact that I don't want somepony coming by, doing stupid stuff that gets them fired, and having been able to see the stream info and now, with a grudge, being able to hijack it.
<Trot_Rot> somehow I went from ponies, to sesame street, real life enactments of 8-bit games, to cup stacking
<SirSprinkles> 6Get it?
<DSNesmith> *shudder*
<roushguy> As are Pinkie Pie/Rainbow Dash
<RAWRity> superbrony64 not all that unbelievable. There was a good 10 year period where the US legitimately thought EVERYTHING to do with Russia in even the most indirect ways was some kind of conspiracy
<Whimsical> I'm gonna go soon
<ForeverOdin> Ahh gotcha
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<sotha> That trombone is good.
<Aponymous> My old furby is still in my closet, waiting to kill me in my sleep.
<Sumica> Watching the strem, and trying to catch up with eqd.
<TuxRug> ... I just pictured Rainbow Dash with a pink mane and Fluttershy with a rainbow mane.
<Spin> Thats sillly Scratch is a DJ.
<SuperBrony64> My Little Ponies: FiM is a threat to AMERICA!!
<TuxRug> staring at each other...
<DSNesmith> hahaha
<Lordlyhour> y god
<DSNesmith> they come two weeks late
<Lordlyhour> That would be so CUTE

<Synros> its awesome
<Lordlyhour> RainbowShy gets internets for taht
<Octavia> 13Well, I've been here a while and I thought I was considered... not so far down the list, you could say.
<FluffyWuffs> Twiluna
<Sumica> it's the history of Russia set to the tetris theme
<RainbowShy> Better yet, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy with swapped colours, making out.
<Spin> First paycheck when I get a job I'm buying this shirt http://www.redbubble.com/people/northerndash/t-shirts/7424363-awesomeness-etc?p=t-shirt&utm_campaign=us_tshirts&utm_medium=product_search&utm_source=google_products

<DSNesmith> the true sign that communism has fallen
<Octavia> 13Well, I'm feelings... I dunno. I dont want to cause drama, so I keep my mouth shut.
<MrMooMoo> Still waiting for ballad of TwilightSparkle...
<Mason_Trowel> I have no one else to talk to about ponies, so when I even mention it around them, they get exasperated and annoyed.
<Octavia> 13Okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm pretty sure even Silver can't see it atm, since I haven't messed with it.
<Natleyn> Best thing about Russia today: Putin.
<Sumica> That name makes me snicker
<a041744> Future history...
<FluffyWuffs> gah, the ballad of twilight sparkle... I stopped reading it after chap 4
<Thunder_Dash> History/Social Studies is my absolute least favorite subject in school
<FluffyWuffs> it didn't catch my interest
<Mason_Trowel> I need to be somewhere where I don't need to be around people who dislike what I like.
<FireFly> Best video ever XD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e87ESYB0hGA

<Turtaguin> thunder_dash *
<Spin> My Bronydom is a well kept secret but I have a shipment of Power level hiding t shirts coming in so hopefully I can weed out the bronies amidst my peers
<Darf14> looks more interesting than depressing
<Octavia> 13But I wanted to look into streaming at some point, but in the middle of a move. So I havent had the time to really go through all the steps to really look into it yet.
<Tovler> R.I.P. Soviet Union. Some day you'll return again.

<Mason_Trowel> While my brother thinks my shirt is funny after a fashion, one of my friends said he won't be seen in public with me while I'm wearing it, and my brother and other roommates said they would if only to laugh when I get made fun of. Well, I've got news for them. I bet I'll get lots of brohoofs walkin' 'round with Sweetie Belle on my shirt.
<DSNesmith> this isn't the best YTP I've seen
<Synros> lol my co-worker is like wtf are u watching. I just turn to him. then turned back to the screen
<Tovler> Season 2 will be crazier and YTPs exist

<Sumica> like that they put eqd ap for taht ad.
<DSNesmith> exiiiit
<Mason_Trowel> The only friends I have around me in RL are my brother, my roommates, and 1 other person. All of them hate the fact that I'm a brony. They don't treat me bad or anything, but they hate it when I bring up ponies. Which pretty much happens all the time for me now, whether I mean to or not.

<DSNesmith> pears!
<Natleyn> I HATE PEARS
<FireFly> All off my friends are pony fans like me!
<sotha> Three
<Thunder_Dash> I HATE PEARS
<roushguy> I've been talking about them more and more

<Aponymous> It's still awesome though.
<a041744> I HATE PAETS
<RAWRity> we watched this episode last week I believe
<mib_5hn478> what...
<sotha> aww
<TrollightSparkle> What
<DSNesmith> finally, free
<SuperBrony64> NOOOOO
<roushguy> And I've grown hyper-obsessed with Fluttershy
<Tovler> I love Pez
<sotha> I HATE PEARS
<Aponymous> What?
<Darf14> Hmm..don't remember this line on Doctor who
<Turtaguin> wat
<a041744> Darn it SME!
<DSNesmith> AND THIS IS PERFECT LULLABY MUSIC
<Natleyn> DSN GO GO GO
<SirSprinkles> 6OH GAWD THIS
<SuperBrony64> Awesome!
<FireFly> lol what are the girl versions of bronies called ?
<Natleyn> fffffffffff
<Filter> Pega-sis
<mib_5hn478> hmm...this...actually...ME GUSTA
<Filter> ters
<lime_star> ooh I love this one
<MrMooMoo> Bronies.
<a041744> This makes me rock out as much as anything
<Synros> no
<Sockwear_Moon> Bronies
<roushguy> See
<roushguy> Thing is
<Xiagu> Bronies
<Mason_Trowel> I tried to show them the show, and they watched it. They honestly thought it was dumb, they didn't like the song.
<Mason_Trowel> *songs
<roushguy> Fluttershy is almost everything I am not
<Mason_Trowel> And they think the characters are stupid.
<Synros> 10 million fulltershys, we..are..fucked...
<Aponymous> Darf14: It's part of Famil Of Blood/Human Nature, but it wasn't shown in the episode.
<RAWRity> This actually makes "Fireflies" tolerable, mostly because this is the kind of stuff I expect diabetes causing sweetness about.
<Sockwear_Moon> :O
<roushguy> She's calm, I'm usually trying to keep a lid on my temper
<ForeverOdin> Ouch. Pretty much all my close friends know I'm a brony, and they'll tease me about it, but usually they're pretty tolerant. And I have onegood friend who was a brony without me converting him. Working on converting some of my other friends ha
<MrMooMoo> Samehere mason sort of.
<roushguy> She's quiet, I'm usually kinda loud
<a041744> I just love the soft voice on this song.
<Darf14> Oh didn't know that, thanks Aponymous
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah they have
<SuperBrony64> Any ideas what the best MLP:FiM wallpaper is?
<Mason_Trowel> And they just can't get over the fact that it is ponies, always going on about how stupid it is for someone our age to like a show for little girls.
<Thunder_Dash> I like this, but the "I would just stand and... Smile" line irks me and I dunno why
<roushguy> She's shy, and I babble my head off when I meet new people... but that's because I'm shy in my own way
<MrMooMoo> Same here ForeverOdin
<Tovler> 10 million Fluttershys... wait I already made a hunting joke when this song last played
<mib_5hn478> I actually like this, as in many more times than the original
<MrMooMoo> I just dont know any bronies irl...
<TrollightSparkle> SuperBrony64
<Aponymous> I like Fireflies... and this song.
<TrollightSparkle> http://wtfbot.net/pix/751.png
<RAWRity> some guy on the comments for this vid complained about the autotune
<roushguy> Maybe that one guy from the AD IRC is right...
<Synros> didn't we already take to Fluttershy about cloning herself?
<Sockwear_Moon> Well, if one of my friends actually said that to me, I'd tell them that they're not understanding the simple fact that it is an escape. Like gaming and reading. An escape into innocence.
<roushguy> ah well
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle: I wouldn't expect any less >_<
<TrollightSparkle> :)
<Natleyn> Anypony still want that Twilight video?
<roushguy> Yeah sockwear
<mib_cbwrbl> what time is season 2 eastern standard time
<roushguy> I really don't like my life
<Mason_Trowel> Tonight, my brother and roommates all pretty much said that they wish I had a restore point top before I was a brony, cuz they'd rather listen to me constantly talk about TVTropes than ponies.
<MrMooMoo> I want to go to some meetups.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 9 AM anon
<mib_5hn478> not soon enough
<Mason_Trowel> *to
<Darf14> That art looks good...but the horn...well....I will just leave it at that
<roushguy> So why can't I imagine a better life in Equestria?
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I wanted to sing this song...
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Fluttershy version though... not original.
<Trot_Rot> I was just at a reddit meetup a few days ago
<Natleyn> ANYWAY, for great justice
<Xiagu> meetups are awesome
<Natleyn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
<SuperBrony64> Is there any meaning to the Pillow on the head or am I just being stupid?
<Xiagu> MrMooMoo, http://bronies.com
<thunder-colt> I'm throwing caution into the wind and am gonna wear an RD shirt to school on monday
<RAWRity> Even for ponies, I'm not getting up at 9 for a saturday, so I'll be recording the episode.
<thunder-colt> screw the haters
<Xiagu> ^ the best plan
<Sockwear_Moon> It isn't so much not liking life, its more an escape from the daily stress of every day life. Stress relief, if you will. It is cute, it is innocent, it has funny moments, etc.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Testing the music stream would be wonderful, if we could have a try at it
<SuperBrony64> 9 AM PST?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Awwwwwww RAWRity....join us!
<Natleyn> I'm getting up. >w>
<MrMooMoo> Theres are brony group in my area too.
<Darf14> Whats the name of that song?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 EST
<Natleyn> 9am EST
<Sumica> try geting up at 6 RAWRity =p
<TrollightSparkle> As in, that morning, that morning?
<ForeverOdin> I really want there to be a meetup where I live, but I doubt there ever will be, at least anytime soon hah
<mib_cbwrbl> this channel should have
<SuperBrony64> Oh damn
<Thunder_Dash> I'm going to stay up to see the Season 1 marathon anyways, so... :P
<SuperBrony64> That's 6 PST
<Sockwear_Moon> My friends probably wouldn't like it because they fear losing their "man card"
<Xiagu> ForeverOdin, you could start one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 RIGHT ON Thunder_Dash!
<MrMooMoo> Nor Cal Bronies!
<SuperBrony64> We talking about tomorrow or when Season 2 premiers?
<Lordlyhour> Omnom
<RAWRity> sumica NO, i do that the rest of the week as it is (GOD DAMN 8 AM CLASSES)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we're gona party pinkie pie style
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Val, I have about 150GB or more of music so..... we would be rolling
<Lordlyhour> Jam toll thingies
<Natleyn> Season two
<Mason_Trowel> Yeah...bronies.com has no known Northern Nevada brony locations on their map.
<Lordlyhour> roll**
<Sumica> 17th SuperBrony64
<Xiagu> Sockwear_Moon, that doesn't mean they won't like it, it just means they'll be conflicted about liking it
*Thunder_Dash brohoofs ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> niiiiiiiiice
<Xiagu> Sockwear_Moon, just like all of us were :P
<Darf14> Pinkie has hands
<SuperBrony64> Ok
<Mason_Trowel> Odds of me finding enough of them for a meetup are slim to none...
*Natleyn brohooves everypony
<ValtheJean> I pretty much figured I'd use youtube and grooveshark for all the songs
<ForeverOdin> I've actually thought about it, But I'm not too good with those types of things. Maybe sometime though.
<ValtheJean> but hey, that works too :P
<Darf14> *brohoof*
<RAWRity> Ponies with hands just look wrong
<FireFly> OMG there is one in the bay area! i am so joining!
<Tovler> Is anyone streaming the 6pm repeat of MLP?
<SuperBrony64> That Pinkie is a lie!
*Synros returns the brohoof
<Sumica> We are Tovler
<Natleyn> Night, ponies.
<SuperBrony64> Wait 6 AM or PM?
<Darf14> Its an alternate reality
<lime_star> what ar the lyrics for this?
<Lordlyhour> Seriously
<TrollightSparkle> Good night Natleyn
<Sockwear_Moon> Well, yeah. But it would be difficult to get them to watch it in the first place. I know I was on the fence with the pilot episode, but I warmed up to it by the end.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 6 PM is the re-showing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 9 AM is the premiere
<Sumica> 6am pst on the 17th
<Lordlyhour> You don't loose your mancard when you become a brony
<Tovler> neat
<Octavia> 13Did we confirm there is a re-showing?
<SuperBrony64> Damn, okay
<Lordlyhour> you get an upgrade
<Xiagu> ^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well sumica just said he is :P
<ForeverOdin> Yus
<SuperBrony64> Octavia: I guess so
<Sumica> I will let you know tomarrow Octavia
<Darf14> So it will be 8 here for the reshowing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or not, never mind
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll just go back to hiding under a rock :P
<Octavia> 13The Hub schedule isnt up to the 17th yet, so I'm unsure.
<Thunder_Dash> 2PM here for the reshow
<SuperBrony64> I'm hoping you can get a Season Pass on iTunes for Season 2
<Trot_Rot> I have a few shirts
<Tovler> Shave and a haircut 2 bit
<a041744> again....
<RAWRity> While I like that they're trying to bring back saturday morning cartoons, I also despise getting up before noon on saturdays...so it seems we're at an impasse Hasbro.
<Sockwear_Moon> Well yeah. We all know MLP is the manliest thing on the planet. :P
<Trot_Rot> hang on lemme find the page
<Xiagu> I have 4 shrits.
<Darf14> dejavu, oh well this ad still rocks
<Xiagu> shirts, even
<Sumica> sadly the guides are only for 1week in advanced
<Thunder_Dash> I wish my iPod was like this D:
<thunder-colt> I need shirts
<thunder-colt> :\
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol I don't sleep in on weekends anymore
<Octavia> 13One schedule I looked at didnt show MLP on any other time during the day except the 9am premiere. But I'm wanting to see the Hubs itself
<VioletVanilla> 
<Trot_Rot> ahh crap
<Tovler> Appleloosan Psychiatrist?
<Trot_Rot> didn't bookmark the site
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there's too many pony related things to do ;)
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Grooveshark?
<Turtaguin> ha! you support apple
<Mason_Trowel> I have one shirt. My Dumb Fabric shirt.
<Thunder_Dash> Having a Derpy background and all the episodes ISN'T ENOUGH
<SuperBrony64> Haha Old Spice time
<Sockwear_Moon> I have no shirts, unfortunately. I should get one with Derpy's cutie mark, or Twilight's.
<thunder-colt> LOL mason!
<Darf14> Shut up and take my money!
<ValtheJean> it's become my source of music ever since Imeem got bought out by gay-wad myspace
<Sumica> Big mac pimpen
<ValtheJean> it's just a giant music database
<ValtheJean> and you make playlists from it
<a041744> Big mac is awesome eeyup
<RAWRity> AND THEN BIG MAC WON RARITY'S HEART
<Darf14> Correction take my bits!
<ForeverOdin> I'm actually quite surprised though how few bronies there seem to be here, but how tolerant they are anyway. I'll wear my Vinyl Scratch shirt downtown and get no worse than an amused glance here and there. Otherwise, either people don't get it well enough or don't care.
<Thunder_Dash> ALL MY MONEY, TAKE IT
<SuperBrony64> I am a horse
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I have professional DJ software, overkill kind of stuff, so burning down into the ground would be okay
<Turtaguin> lol
<TrollightSparkle> Aw

<Trot_Rot> I have RD

<SuperBrony64> Is someone controlling the videos now? lol
<a041744> Oh this one :)
<roushguy> I don't have any MLP stuff
<Turtaguin> oh this
<roushguy> I'm too poor
<thunder-colt> same
<SuperBrony64> OMG, what's happening?
<Sumica> FOR LUNA!
<a041744> Is Luna awake again?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh...I don't really like this vid
<Darf14> Oh no...no...dont they dare!!!
<sotha> HELLO~
<RAWRity> I don't like where this is going
<SuperBrony64> He's not bombing Ponyville?!
<Thunder_Dash> I don't like where this is going...

<atomic7732> and hopefully get it so I can wear it to school next week
<Darf14> Curse you Luna! TO THE MOOOONNNNNNAAAAA!
<thunder-colt> but what ones? i want ALL THE SHIRTS!
<Sumica> Celstia is not amused
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Trot_Rot> at first I was like "I'm not commercializing!"
<ForeverOdin> I got mine for $10, and I love it. ^.^ Not all merc is super-plushie expensive
<a041744> ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNONS ARE A GO
<Darf14> Its the orbital Friendship cannon
<Mason_Trowel> My city is really too small scale for me to have any chance of encountering a brony.
<Thunder_Dash> GOTCHA
<SuperBrony64> Holy shit, this is actually well made
<SuperBrony64> What video is this?!!?
<Trot_Rot> but after seeing how many other bronies there are
<Aponymous> Silly Luna, I have a Kill Sat!
<Xiagu> There are so many bronies
<Darf14> overkill much?
<SuperBrony64> lol the moon
<Xiagu> you need to be flamboyant to find other ones
<Spose> I want pony swag. But I want SUBTLE stuff.
<TrollightSparkle> And THAT'S how Equestria was made!
<RAWRity> AND THAT'S HOW APOLLO 18 STARTS
<rainbowdashismyhony> i luvvvvv ranbow dash
<Trot_Rot> I just got them so it's like a homing beacon to fellow followers
<Turtaguin> lol
<Sumica> unmade
<VioletVanilla> 6,0like what?
<atomic7732> I'm hoping by wearing the shirt that I'll find some bronies at my school, I already know of two
<Xiagu> but some people don't like flamboyant bronies :/
<ValtheJean> DJ software
<ValtheJean> tis nice
<SuperBrony64> What's the name of this video?
<a041744> this is the viedo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x8bZJPovUQ&list=PL2A047F574F63F78E&index=49
<rainbowdashismyhony> i was marred to her last week actually.
<Mason_Trowel> I could try going to Reno, but I doubt anyone would just say, "OMG, you a brony, too? Let's exchange contact information and try to get other bronies together!"
<ForeverOdin> Trot-rot: Same here actually
<Darf14> Great, now luna is the sole survivo- oh nevermind
<RAWRity> but seriously, Apollo 18 sucked.
<Xiagu> I hate subtlety, it usually doesn't work for finding closet bronies
<ForeverOdin> I need to start using tab lol...
<a041744> Apollo 18 ahem,, had no atmosphere
<thunder-colt> in a small country town of 2700 people, i have doubts ill find other bronies
<Xiagu> at least, in large crowds
<SuperBrony64> Thanks a041744!
<rainbowdashismyhony> u kno that?????
<Thunder_Dash> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

<rainbowdashismyhony> honestly i dont think pinky pi is that grate.................
<Darf14> Only Luna Knows what happened to apollo 18

<SuperBrony64> DON'T TELL ANYONE!
<Aponymous> OH
*HaysforPonies now remebers PPGZ
<Aponymous> SNAP
<Thunder_Dash> 9AM PST
<Darf14> *gasp* Biggest spoiler of all time!! :o
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not familiar with australian timezone, but it's 9AM EST
<thunder-colt> off topic, but i remember hearing there's going to be a season 3
*SuperBrony64 listening
<MrMooMoo> So they could make the toys for it.
<SuperBrony64> WHAT?!?!!?!?!
<Scary_Scott> they will find it Kawai (did I spell that right?) Im sure they will love it
<a041744> WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH?!
<Thunder_Dash> *EST
<HaysforPonies> Yes, there is likely a season 3
<rainbowdashismyhony> I luv rainbow dash, because shes so sassy nd powerful.
<Thunder_Dash> my bad ^^;
<RainbowShy> thunder-colt, that's never off topic.
<Darf14> and Snape kill Dumbledor
<Aponymous> Did NOT see that coming!
<DragonRage> Ah yeah, Madmax's comic.
<DragonRage> Hi dari!
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Kabaka> Everyone's going to be so disappointed when it turns out to be a pony.
<Donraj> <RoyGBiv> A lot of people are holding weddings today because it's 9-10-11
<Donraj> ^What?
<Donraj> ...Oooh
<AllisZero> Man, this sucks.
<Donraj> I was trying to figure out why the hell you would want your wedding to be on the day before 9/11
<AllisZero> I'll have to wait at least two years to buy the car I want now. ANOTHER two years.
<DragonRage> Why?
<RoyGBiv> Yeah, but everyone wants a CUTE wedding date
<RoyGBiv> So 9-10-11 & 10-11-12 are like booked up worldwide at wedding sites
<AllisZero> Don't have the cash to buy it, and I need a second car right away
<RoyGBiv> I'd rather get married on 12-12-12 if we're going for cute. :p
<AllisZero> So buying a cheaper car, and then saving up for that one. But with my credit, having two car loans will be impossible, so I'll have to pay this one off before anything.
<prince-dari> A wild RainBro appeared.
<RainBroDash> ohai
<ValtheJean> 2,14 omg it's Rainbro!! <#
<RainBroDash> oh, ill register and you can op me dari
<DragonRage> Rainbro?
<ValtheJean> 2,13 <3* even
<RainBroDash> while you're here
<DragonRage> Ohai Rainbro!
*AllisZero uses Splash
*DragonRage hugs Rainbro.
*AllisZero it's not very effective.
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi RainBroDash
<AllisZero> OATMEAL
<AllisZero> ARE YOU CRAZ-
<DragonRage> So right now we have Rainbow, Rainbow_Dash, and RainBroDash in chat. That might get a little confusion.
<DragonRage> ... confusing, even.
<DragonRage> >mi cara cuando my brain is oatmeal from not getting enough sleep
<DragonRage> >mi cara cuando I have no face
<RainBroDash> 10kk dari I'm registered
<RainBroDash> 10ty
<AllisZero> Gonna get ready to go seal my fate for the next two years. Later gentlecolts
<DragonRage> Ciao, mate.
<DragonRage> Aand ponychan is post-locked yet again.
<DragonRage> This is going to be a thing all day, I'm guessing.
<EmmettBrown> GREAT SCOTT,my name is bold!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I feel really bad for !!Celestia
<DragonRage> Likewise.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the spam raids have been going crazy, and mods are quitting like every week it seems
<DragonRage> Yeah.
<DragonRage> I'm hoping this last one wasn't because of any particular incident. From what little I've seen of her, I really liked !!Pinkie Pie.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 !!Pinkie Pie did a lot of background cleaning up
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he probably just got really tired, and didn't want to handle the stress of S2
<DragonRage> Well, he did say that he'd like to come back and be a moderator again in the future and that this was just a vacation for him, so... probably.
<DragonRage> From what I understand he (or she?) runs a lot of other things too.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, best wishes to him
<NewDCD> 9oh yay
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<DragonRage> And then NewDCD was here.
<DragonRage> Hi DCD!
<EmmettBrown> Not sure which celestial bodyy to do random facts about today
<DragonRage> Io.
<EmmettBrown> Alright,I'll do Jupiter's 64 moons
<john_pony> hello?
<RainBroDash> 10ohai
<EmmettBrown> Jupiter has 64 confirmed moons,[1][2] giving it the largest retinue of moons with "reasonably secure" orbits of any planet in the Solar System.
<john_pony> wat
<EmmettBrown> Ignore those numbers
<RainBroDash> 10EmmettBrown you and your damn moons
<john_pony> so howmany days left?
<EmmettBrown> except 64,64 is important
<RainBroDash> 10john_pony it's one week today
<RainBroDash> 10next saturday morning (usa time)
<john_pony> OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
<john_pony> ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
<RainBroDash> 10I know right :D:D
<john_pony> gotta love rainbowdash quotes
<DragonRage> I'm very excited.
<RainBroDash> 10 20% cooler than all other pony quotes.
<john_pony> yerp
<EmmettBrown> Cool,my apple makes a rattling noise when I shake it
<DragonRage> ... is... is that normal?
<john_pony> well everypony ima go ill see yall later
<DragonRage> I haven't had an apple in months, can't remember if they're supposed to rattle.
<RainBroDash> 10cya john_pony
<DragonRage> Also, ciao john_pony.
<GGgala> echo and then RainBroDash / Olly was off in Skype.
<GGgala> lolwut
<RainBroDash> 10wat?
<DragonRage> ... Olly?
<RainBroDash> 10... is my name irl ;)
<EmmettBrown> Looked it up on google,got millions of results about iphones but none about apples
<DragonRage> Ah.
<RainBroDash> 10EmmettBrown I'm really not sure if they are /supposed/ to rattle. We need to test this, for science
<EmmettBrown> I'm afraid to eat it now
<DragonRage> It might be a spy.
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.threadless.com/profile/218163/squeegebeckenheim/blog/317760/My_apple_sounds_like_a_rattle
<RainBroDash> 10there is only one other person in the entire world who has had this problem
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<RainBroDash> 10"why does my apple rattle -iphone -macbook -laptop -phone -ipod" is what I googled
<RainBroDash> 10the rest are nonsense results
<EmmettBrown> I remember watching a play where the entire story broke off half way through to talk about a species of apples that rattle when you shake them
<DragonRage> Wow.
<DragonRage> Now I'm curious: What was the play?
<EmmettBrown> Maybe it has immigrants in it
<RainBroDash> 10^
<EmmettBrown> he paly was Danny;champion of the world
<RainBroDash> 10anyway peoples, gonna go play some starcraft 2 in the sun
<DragonRage> Ciao RainBroDash.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you'd better play zerg
<DragonRage> Tell the sun I said hi.
<RainBroDash> 10see you all in a bit :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or I wont wub woo anymore
<Nittany_Tiger> The sun?
<Nittany_Tiger> What's that?
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't seen that in 4 days here.
<Rainbow_Dash> A rattling apple. How interesting
<Nittany_Tiger> Just clouds.
<RainBroDash> 10and ValtheJean ofc I play zerg.
<RainBroDash> 10I play zerg at a horribly casually bad level
<RainBroDash> 10anyway be back later and ting
<RainBroDash> 10Idk, but I'm on holiday and everybody's talking about it
<RainBroDash> 10gonna go see what all the fuss is about
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good, good :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 zerg are the ponies of starcraft :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Holiday? What occasion?
<RainBroDash> 10mfw my tan is going to be epic after this holiday
<RainBroDash> 10just on vacation with the family
<RainBroDash> 10(us brits use the word holiday as a synonym for vacation)
<RainBroDash> 10SC2 with the Sonic Adventure 2 soundtrack on in the background
<RainBroDash> 10inb4 everybody is jelly
*RainBroDash 10is now actually going afk for real
<DragonRage> SA2 Soundtrack?
*DragonRage would rather listen to More Gun. Over and over and over...
<DragonRage> Anyhow, gonna shower. BBL.
<EmmettBrown> There were so many rock ballads in the sonic adventure 2 soundtrack
<EmmettBrown> The most massive of Jupiter's moons, the four Galilean moons, were discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun.
<EmmettBrown> It's very quiet
<EmmettBrown> Why is my name bold?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so you can see whenever someone addresses you
<Rainbow_Dash> Now the zombies shall be afraid of me, for I have a stick with nails in it!
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol, but seriously. A stick with some nails on the end is my best weapon for now
<DragonRage> 20 minute shower. That was fast.
<MisterLolrus> Ponies
<DragonRage> I think My Little Pony is a pretty cool guy.
<DragonRage> Eh learns about friendship and doesn't afraid of anything.
*Dermathil waves to all
*MeteorVenture waves back
*DragonRage waves to the both of you.
*Dermathil gives MeteorVenture a party hat
*MeteorVenture raves back
*Dermathil gives a party hat to DragonRage
<DragonRage> Danke.
<Rainbow_Dash> You still havent given me a party hat. D=
*Dermathil gives Rainbow_Dash a party hat
<DragonRage> Anyhow, gonna play some more TF2 while waiting for the stream. Still got an hour to go.
<Rainbow_Dash> Thanks. =P
<Rainbow_Dash> Also, hey MeteorVenture
<Dermathil> almost max level in the Space Marine multiplayer already
<MeteorVenture> hey!
<MeteorVenture> i've been kinda bummed out today.. it's getting better though
<Alumonius> *Stretch* HOW IS EVERYONE?
<MeteorVenture> (see last post)
*Dermathil gives Alumonius a party hat.
<MeteorVenture> if you want to know why i am bummed out then i will give you a beautifully written explanation
<Rainbow_Dash> Your written explanations usually fry my brain. So no thanks XD
<MeteorVenture> i'll take that as a yes since you said (with added punctuation for better understanding) "written explanations? my thanks"
<MeteorVenture> so here's what happened.. >see a R34 picture >close it >it never leaves
<MeteorVenture> it's been bugging me all day long.. and it happened yesterday
<MeteorVenture> so i'll probably be at least less bummed out by tomorrow
<Alumonius> Start>Shut down> wait> turn back on
<MeteorVenture> well when i said never leaves i mean it's burnt into my brain for the time being.. since i don't want it there it naturally stays for a long long time.. like a song
<MeteorVenture> a terrible song that you would like to punch if it had physical form
<Alumonius> tehe
<DragonRage> Welp, that could've gone better.
<MeteorVenture> what could have? i ask
<DragonRage> Another round of Turbine, this time I played Engie.
<DragonRage> Chose to go on RED despite them having lost three rounds and only won one.
<DragonRage> We pretty much stalemated the last thirteen minutes, so RED lost on account of having won less round overall.
<DragonRage> Still, met yet another brony because of it.
<DragonRage> I seem to have a lot of luck with that.
<MeteorVenture> speaking of which.. i went back on kongregate after a long absence and found a friend or 2 were now bronies.. 1 had pinkie pie as his avatar
<DragonRage> Awesome.

<VioletVanilla> 6,0Heheheh~

<ReticentSmolder> I would like Memebase's brony site a lot more if they didn't blatantly watermark everything
<RobotPinkie> ohay everypony
<MantisToboggan> what's up with the inferior streaming service you guys use btw
<SirSprinkles> 6Veemi?
<MantisToboggan> should consider switching to justin.tv
<SirSprinkles> 6...ew god no.
<MantisToboggan> why not
<SirSprinkles> 6Because ew god no?
<MantisToboggan> i come from a community where everyone and their mom streams at 1080p so watching these 360p streams feels so ghetto
<MantisToboggan> :P
<ReticentSmolder> Veemi works fine...
<Alumonius> Nine minutes! LETS LIVE THROUGH IT!
*ReticentSmolder hugs Alumonius
<DecapKing> http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/demotivational-posters-vicious-cycle.jpg
<MantisToboggan> in any case i hope you guys upgrade the stream quality at some point
<DecapKing> http://chzragecomics.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rage-comics-that-guy-zelda-or-whatever.jpg
<VioletVanilla> 6,0We are working on it Mantis, by the livestream of Season 2 we will have clear picture.
<MantisToboggan> cool
<ReticentSmolder> they offer high and low quality (respective to each other) and with a chat of 200 bronies it still slogs down
<ReticentSmolder> its not necessarily their fault
<MantisToboggan> well in the esports scene we'll have 50,000 people watching and stream chat literally unreadably fast
<MantisToboggan> at 1080p
<MantisToboggan> so those are honestly problems of 5 years ago
<MantisToboggan> and not 2011
<MeteorVenture> zelda = 100X better than black ops (i've only played for 0 minutes)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 as an fyi, chat is completely irrelevant to the stream being slow
<ReticentSmolder> HATE DETECTED FIRING ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that was just on the streamer's side
<NewDCD> 9ohai guys what's going on in this thread?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 suddenly, DCD
<MeteorVenture> just chattin'
<WhatPayne> Waiting
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Happy Birthday DCD! :3
<DecapKing> http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wtf-photos-videos-invisibilly.jpg
<NewDCD> 9>reads chat
<NewDCD> 9oh lawdeh
<NewDCD> 9Mantis
<RobotPinkie> It's DCD's birthday?
<NewDCD> 9what's your monitor's resolution?
<MantisToboggan> what does that have to do with anything
<NewDCD> 9a lot.
<NewDCD> 9just tell me.
<RandomExtra> It's your Birthday DCD?! Party!:D
<MantisToboggan> no need to get defensive :)
<srilanga> does anybody know if bronystate will be doing this for every episode, or only the premiere?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 every episode my friend
<srilanga> cool
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if it's Season 2, we're streaming it ;)
<Turgle> :]
<srilanga> my college doesn't have the hub channel
<NewDCD> 9so Mantis, what do you define as 1080p?
<srilanga> convenient
<MantisToboggan> NewDCD i don't pretend to have some godly knowledge of these things, all i know is your stream quality is what i was watching 5 years ago
<MantisToboggan> what it says on the tin when iwatch streams is 1080p
<MantisToboggan> and it looks the same as 1080 on say, youtube
*ReticentSmolder is very lucky to have the Hub and not know it before season 1 ended
<MantisToboggan> so that's all I can tell you
<NewDCD> 9well you've been fed nothing but lies. 1080p is a resolution.
<NewDCD> 9ergo, a 700 x 520 window will NEVER be true 1080p
<NewDCD> 9it might try to emulate it
<NewDCD> 9but it will NEVER be 1080p
<MantisToboggan> ok
<NewDCD> 9not to mention we're not a commercial business
<MantisToboggan> doesn't change the difference in quality though
<NewDCD> 9businesses can do that
<RobotPinkie> It might be 1080p if you maximize it...
<NewDCD> 9we can't
<MantisToboggan> uh
<MantisToboggan> people stream from their basements
<Dermathil> NEWDCD!!!!!
*Dermathil gives NewDCD a party hat
<NewDCD> 9okay buster
<Sumica> youtube dose 1080 now?
<MantisToboggan> i'll link you something hang on
<NewDCD> 9you want HD?
<NewDCD> 9I'll give you your HD.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Sumica> HD ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON!
<MantisToboggan> http://www.twitch.tv/steven_bonnell_ii
<Dermathil> wait, wat?
<MantisToboggan> there's one that "says 1080p" which i guess is wrong but
<MantisToboggan> look
<Dermathil> NewDCD's birthday is today?
<MantisToboggan> I CAN READ THE WORDS ON THE SCREEN HOLY SHIT
<MantisToboggan> which is more than can be said about your stream
<MantisToboggan> and these are facts that your overly defensive attitude isn't changing
<MantisToboggan> also this guy streams from his house
<MantisToboggan> and is not a business.
*Dermathil waves at NewDCD, trying to get attention
<MantisToboggan> and i could link you dozens of people who do the same, at different times of the day
<Pegacorn> I HAVE RETURNED
<MeteorVenture> we need a fast typing brony to sub the episode in real time
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Ohohohoho~ Hallo Pegacorn~ ;3

<Alumonius> It's show time :D
<Dermathil> SO, VioletVanilla: is today NewDCD's birthday? Or did you wish him happy birthday randomly?
<DecapKing> wowo you can read the words, congragulations
<srilanga> it's telling me the broadcast is still offline. anybody else have this problem?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is his birthday, yes
<ReticentSmolder> all I have to say is http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9896347.jpg

<Nittany_Tiger> 15-25 is wrong. I'm 28. Above-avg. intelligence but an underachiever is wrong. I'm a grad student with a physics bachelor's degree. Racist to some degree is wrong. Nope. Non-religious is wrong. I'm Christian.

<VioletVanilla> 6,0Half part for Silverscreen~
<NewDCD> 9get in there, I'll show you "720p"
<NewDCD> 9and then I'll explain why we aren't doing it
<DecapKing> no it would just blow your brains apart Nittany_Tiger
<RobotPinkie> I'm 30, bi, overachiever, hopefully not racist, pantheist, so....
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol DCD, did you set that up JUST to show him?
<Silverscreen> 11THE BEEPING!
<Alumonius> Can we start the broadcast please? I'm tired of waiting for something to happen :l
<Silverscreen> 11IT'S GONNA BLOW!
<RobotPinkie> Mind NOT blown.
<Dermathil> NEWDCD
*Silverscreen 11HITS THE DECK!
<Nittany_Tiger> No, it would blow the rest of my head away but leave my brain.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's starting in a second, Alu.
<Alumonius> k
<NewDCD> 9Alumonius,we're having technical difficulties with the main channel
*Pegacorn crawls away
<Sumica> jease and I thought I did too much tab browsing.
<Dermathil> Gotta tell you something, NewDCD.
<NewDCD> 9please direct your viewing to the 720p demo in the meantime
<Dermathil> WE SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY MAN, ISN'T THAT AWESOME?
<NewDCD> 9HAPPY BIRTHDAY DRILLGUY
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Oh oh! DCD! Show us some robots!
<NewDCD> 9okay starting 720p test
<RandomExtra> So many tabs...
<Nittany_Tiger> May 7th: best day ever.
*Dermathil brohoofs NewDCD
<VioletVanilla> 6,0First of may? First of may! Apple bucking starts today~
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Turgle> LOL
<RobotPinkie> Not getting any sound
<Sumica> hey that ep was on thismorning.
<Nittany_Tiger> May is the climatological peak of tornado season.
<Silverscreen> 11am I the only one who hears nothing but beeping from that stream?
<WhatPayne> Beeping here
<Dermathil> we all hear it silverscreen
<RandomExtra> I hear it too.
*Dermathil gives Sumica a party hat.
<Nittany_Tiger> DCD's alarm is going off.
<RobotPinkie> No beeping, just... no sound
<Nittany_Tiger> Or a bomb.
*Silverscreen 11mutes it and goes back to work.
<Aponymous> The beeping is getting faster.
<Nittany_Tiger> And that beeping is speeding up.
<typjk> it's the tab-overload alarm
<MobileDCD> damn it. Well killed the audio
<RobotPinkie> maybe really low beeping?
<Sumica> Oh a hat, how quaint.
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<MobileDCD> however, how do you like the video
<Dermathil> Party hat for NewDCD and my birthday's today!
<RobotPinkie> I wish I could brush Rarity's hair for her... oh wait, I can.
<Flutteryay> It appears ... really jerky for me
<WhatPayne> Laggy as hell
<RobotPinkie> *brushie brushie*
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-percent-harder-in-ten-seconds-flat.jpg
<MobileDCD> and that's why we don't do 720p. Most internet connections can't handle it.
<Flutteryay> DecapKing, were you ever known as El Decapo anywhere?
<DecapKing> nope
<Flutteryay> OK GOOD
<DecapKing> Decapman, xxheadremoverxx
<Turgle> i can't even load the stream
<NewDCD> 9see what I mean?
<RobotPinkie> My connection can handle 720p fine, but the stream's still jerky
<WhatPayne> I have 100meg internet and it's just choppy
<Flutteryay> Eeyup
<DecapKing> and some other things
<NewDCD> 9no matter how good your internet is
<NewDCD> 9most computers cannot handle the high internet load plus the whole rendering
<WhatPayne> Oh I totally get it
<NewDCD> 9it's just too much of a load divided by little time
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-me-too-pega-sister2.jpg
<NewDCD> 9think of it as a decimal dividing a whole number
<NewDCD> 9the load total skyrockets
<RobotPinkie> Well, to be fair to MantisToboggan, the stream he linked to works perfectly fine in 720p for me.
<Nittany_Tiger> 1/(.5) = 1/(1/2) = 1*2 = 2.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can do what the internet can't!
<NewDCD> 9by the way, Dermathil
<RobotPinkie> but I agree that that's not a very wise setting, or you wouldn't get half the viewers
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie, link his ass
<Ghosties> 4O.O
<Ghosties> 4I read that differently...
<RobotPinkie> Huh?
<Dermathil> wat
<Aponymous> ?
<NewDCD> 9also Dermathil
<Octavia> 13lmao
<NewDCD> 9do you post in ponychan
<Sumica> I am sure with corporate sponsors we could totally have that kind of stream too.
<Dermathil> I once did, but the total number of posts probably don't even reach the double digits.
<Darf14> only once
<Ignaesia> Is the stream up?
<WhatPayne> I have good internet connection, but not that good pc, so I much rather take slightly smaller stream anyday if that means no lag
<Flutteryay> I post5 on Ponichan ALL THE TIIIIIME
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate chans.
<Nittany_Tiger> I avoid them.
<Nittany_Tiger> 4chan just gives any chan a bad name.
<Alumonius> *waiting for broadcast*
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I read something bad in that DCD c.c
<RobotPinkie> Yeah. It also puts a much higher load on the streamers' computers, cutting down the number of viable streamers for BMN.
<Darf14> I guess chan is just taboo on the internet
<Pegacorn> I GOT AWAY!YAY!
<NewDCD> 9just link me, Robot
<ReticentSmolder> what about ponichan nittany?
<Flutteryay> I post on Equestria Daily now that that FUCKING BASTARD Dave Mustang the Cynical Brony is gone
<Nittany_Tiger> Nope.
<Flutteryay> Dave Mustang was not a true Brony
<RobotPinkie> To what he already linked you to, NewDCD?
<Flutteryay> Hell, he hates Bronies and ponies now
<RobotPinkie> http://www.twitch.tv/steven_bonnell_ii
<Nittany_Tiger> I know that ponychan has restrictions, but it seems to harbor problems in itself.
<ReticentSmolder> whats this about Dave Flutteryay?
<Dermathil> wat, SC2?
<RobotPinkie> I'd rather watch ponies than SC2, though :P
<Flutteryay> His youtube channel is http://www.youtube.com/user/clonecomanderfox
<WhatPayne> Dave Mustang?
<Flutteryay> Not a misspelling
<Ignaesia> Was the broadcast supposed to begin 30min ago? Because Im getting offline
<NewDCD> 9hmm
<Flutteryay> Yeah he... ugh... he's a traitor
<WhatPayne> Never heard of him...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please be patient everyone, we're working on a solution
<NewDCD> 9Twitch.tv
*ReticentSmolder doesn't know who he is :(
<NewDCD> 9never had heard of them
<Flutteryay> He was an asshole to everypony anyway
<Nittany_Tiger> Dave Mustaine probably never like ponies to begin with.
<Flutteryay> No, not Mustaine. MUSTANG
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, he's the lead singer of Megadeth.
<NewDCD> 9I'll look into it
<Darf14> Dave Mustang?
<Flutteryay> I love Megadeth
<Alumonius> Solution to what?
<RobotPinkie> Seems like a pretty good streaming site, since you can choose your preferred resolution.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DCD, could you join us in Modchat?
<WhatPayne> Wait that Dave Mustang who pops up when I google "Dave Mustang"?
<RobotPinkie> No clue who Dave Mustang is...
<Dermathil> seems like Twitch.tv is for gaming only
<Darf14> same here, never heard of the name
<Nittany_Tiger> Same.
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9exactly
<PositiveForce> Twitch is a spinoff of Justin
<WhatPayne> I don't even know who that Dave Mustang in google is, apparently some musician...
<NewDCD> 9Twitch.tv must have
<NewDCD> 9some propietary software
<Flutteryay> no his full name is "Dave Mustang the Cynical Brony"
<NewDCD> 9not to mention their streaming software (justin.tv) is EXPENSIVE AS FUCK
<WhatPayne> But I am intrigued what has this Dave Mustang done?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well then, if mantis wants to see us upgrade, he's more than happy to pay us for it :P
<NewDCD> 9as in
<Flutteryay> Look at posts on Equestria Daily from July
<NewDCD> 9 999 dollars a month
<Flutteryay> You will see him
<Flutteryay> look @ the comments
<NewDCD> 9for those packages
<RobotPinkie> Ohwow, that's really expensive shit.
<CubeJackal> I'm late I'm late I'm late
<graypaw> Hi guys! one more week!
<CubeJackal> Wait, why isn't the stream on?
<Darf14> Ok I will look at ED in July and look for him, brb
<ReticentSmolder> I googled his name, all of them are reactions to his posts, so it looks like he's acquired a lot of hate
<Flutteryay> EEEEYUP
<Sumica> Like I said we could totally stream like that with corporate funding =p
<WhatPayne> Oh it's the guy who wrote that article about intolerance amongst Bronies?
<Pegacorn> VioletVanilla is gone!HURRAH!
<ReticentSmolder> and I quote: "Dave Mustang, the cynical Brony said... Best Blogger Tips [Reply To This Comment] When will somebody write the story about Scootaloo kidnapping Dash, raping her, and then skinning her alive?"
<Pegacorn> THE FUCK?
<DecapKing> damn, thats fucked up
<ReticentSmolder> so yes...he sounds like a dick
<Flutteryay> yup
<Darf14> Wait, he said that
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm.
<Dermathil> so there's no eurostream today?
<Pegacorn> DAVE MUST DIE
<WhatPayne> No wait he's that commenter.
<NewDCD> 9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<NewDCD> 9get your asses in here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please everyone be patient, we are working on getting the stream back up
<RobotPinkie> lol Dave Mustang complains about the quality of brony writing, then says that bronies will be the "laughing stalk" of the internet. Oh, the precious irony.
<ReticentSmolder> heres another
<ReticentSmolder> There's dedication, then there's just fucking obsession, and that first video is obsession. You know what, we're all destined to become like the final remaining Bronies on /b/, where their average post looks like something an eight year old girl has written. It's inevitable, us Bronies are going to go from being silly,
<ReticentSmolder> to being the laughing stalk of the internet. We're all losing touch with our roots. Didn't the fandom start because of a raid on /b/ by /co/? I say we go back to those original root!
<SirSprinkles> 6Guys, please file into the stream link DCD just posted.
<Dermathil> >mfw the fking ad is trying to kill my browser
<Pegacorn> NOPE RETICENT
<WhatPayne> Different stream?
<ReticentSmolder> that's not my words Pegacorn...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<ReticentSmolder> That's Dave Mustang
<MantisToboggan> NewDCD eh? i thought xsplit was like 50 bucks lifetime
<Pegacorn> Dave Still sucks.
<MantisToboggan> it was free up until recently though so can't remember
<Darf14> Oh silly me, I didn't notice the link
<ReticentSmolder> I thought you new me better Pegacorn >.>
<Dermathil> NewDCD, is there a different chat for that other stream?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, stay here for chatting
<SirSprinkles> 6Just use the popout, Derm.
<Pegacorn> I dunno RS?
<RobotPinkie> So he's a jackass I didn't know about before, and will now go back to not knowing about.
<SirSprinkles> 6At the bottom of the bronystate.net page.
<RobotPinkie> Time for some ponies!
<Flutteryay> YAY
<Aponymous> Haha! Time for one of my favorite movies!
<RobotPinkie> ...or True Romance, first, I guess
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, time for True Romance.
<RobotPinkie> One of mine, too, Aponymous!
<Darf14> I guess I got lucky that I never read Dave's comments, even though I go to Equestria Daily constantly
<Aponymous> *Brohoofs RobotPinkie*
*RobotPinkie brohoofs Aponymous for the kickass A-movie choice
<Flutteryay> yup
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Flutteryay> he hates us "ponyfags" now
<WhatPayne> This movie has quite strong cast
*Dermathil gives party hats to all those who didn't get one already
<Aponymous> I've learned that reading comments sections on ANY site is a waste of time.
<Dermathil> BTW NEWDCD, the A movie next week is FKING BLADE RUNNER!!! FK YEAH
<Nittany_Tiger> YT comments typically ruin the quality of the posted video.
<WhatPayne> Strong cast... and Christian Slater is the too
<Pegacorn> BLADE RUNNER
<WhatPayne> *there
<Nittany_Tiger> Especially when they're unoriginal.
<ValtheJean> ohai luna
<Pegacorn> LUNA!

<RobotPinkie> Pretty much... comments tend to be completely useless.

*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Dermathil> HARRISON FORD
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAA
<Aponymous> ohai Luna
<WhatPayne> Hello Luna
<MantisToboggan> also NewDCD if your point of not having current-day stream quality is that people won't have good enough connections to handle it, fair enough i guess. it's never been a problem (again) in the scene i come from, since justintv, own3dtv, regame etc provide the ability to switch stream quality
<Darf14> Oh hi Luna
<Pegacorn> And then i doomed everypony.
*Pegacorn gets out a potion and throws it at Luna
<Luna> 07beautiful and full
<DecapKing> hey Luna
*DecapKing hugs Luna
*Dermathil gives Luna a party hat
<Aponymous> "I'd fuck Elvis, wanna see some kung fu flicks?"
<WhatPayne> I was just about to say that Luna needs hat
<Dermathil> hey, hey luna, did you know I shared my birthday with NewDCD's?
<Luna> 07yep
<Luna> 07that's why I said happy birthday Derma & DCD :P
<Pegacorn> HEY LUNA,THERE'S A POTION FLYING TOWARDS YOU!
*Dermathil is feeling all giddy inside, probably because of the birthday fact
<Aponymous> Happy birthday Dermathil and NewDCD!
<DecapKing> no one knows when my birthday is XD
<WhatPayne> Right happy birthday guys
<WhatPayne> !
<Darf14> No one does either for me but I am not telling
*Luna grabs it
<Luna> 07thanks

<Aponymous> Bjornfot could very well become the next Tacowiz.
<WhatPayne> I don't like seaponies
<Dermathil> oh, the resident technoviking though is good for it.
<RobotPinkie> Nah, Sea Ponies isn't in MLP: The Movie

<ReticentSmolder> so Flutteryay, I've seen some ridiculously blatant comments by Dave to troll the community, but he does post seriously once in awhile
<MantisToboggan> not really
<Alumonius> Call on the sea ponies~
<MantisToboggan> i know that a ton of people i know stream
<RobotPinkie> Yep, Dermathil, lol

<ReticentSmolder> also, @Flutteryay that sucks... seriously he's made some really hateful comments
<NewDCD> 9Standard $499 /month*
<Flutteryay> eeeyup
<MantisToboggan> huh, since when
<Dermathil> I managed to stream on my ipod with the free justin.tv app
<MobileDCD> and Enterprise: 999 per month
<MobileDCD> that's uStream
<Turgle> thanks RobotPinkie for the link
<MobileDCD> Justin.tv charges for their streaming software, dynno and Wirecast
<Nittany_Tiger> Storm chasers stream with Justin.tv.
<MobileDCD> that said
<Nittany_Tiger> I chased with a couple of streamers this year.
<RobotPinkie> Well it's NewDCD streaming, I'm pretty sure, thank him :P
<MobileDCD> there is a vital reason we're not using justin.tv or uStream as our main streams
<MobileDCD> their output size is perpetually 320 x 240
<MobileDCD> It might look good little, but when you maximize it...llooks like crap
<Darf14> hate justin.tv, its way too laggy for me for some reason
<Wrek> 05Prepare yourselves, the bells have tolled! Shelter your weak, your young and your old! Each of you shall pay the final sum! Cry for mercy; the reckoning has come!
<RobotPinkie> Oh, you have to pay to get above 240p?
<Wrek> 05in other words, Hi everypony
<MobileDCD> also keep in mind Sathi and Sprinks are still learning my quality optimization techniques
<RobotPinkie> ohay Wrek
<MantisToboggan> http://www.justin.tv/p/pro_faq
<MobileDCD> pretty much
<MantisToboggan> i really don't know where you get these numbers from
<Darf14> New mod?
<DecapKing> hey Wrek
*Octavia 13is reminded of the Halloween event on WoW from Wreks message
<MantisToboggan> since everyone where i look and everonye i ask is streaming for free
<MantisToboggan> i'm at a loss, really
<MobileDCD> and also remember the fact that due to the content we're streaming, we can get shut down easily
<DecapKing> Of course you are Octavia
<WhatPayne> Hellew Wrek
<Dumori> Hummm I'm sure I saw a decent free multi stream program the otherday.
<MobileDCD> that said
<MobileDCD> wait a second, Mantis
<MobileDCD> I'll show you the true quality of BronyState
<MobileDCD> ...Once my computer finishes rebooting
<DecapKing> http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/job-fails-tread-carefully.jpg
<MantisToboggan> ok
<RobotPinkie> oh, so who's streaming today?
<MantisToboggan> i'm just having a hard time with your entire argument
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that would be Sprinkles
<MantisToboggan> since i watch on good quality everyday
<Dumori> Then I think it needed a lot of host side bandwidth. So doubt it would be any good.
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<MantisToboggan> and i'm asking people right now and everyone is saying its free
<RobotPinkie> Thanks, Sprinkles!
<MobileDCD> as I said
<MobileDCD> allow me to show you our true colors
<ReticentSmolder> Matnis, I'm having a hard time following your reasoning here, are you upset that the stream quality isn't better?
<ReticentSmolder> Mantis*
<MantisToboggan> i'm not upset
<MantisToboggan> i asked about it earlier and i got a load of excuses that noone makes in any other scene
<MantisToboggan> that don't seem to hold up
<ReticentSmolder> well, who are these other people who claim these other sites are perfect and free?
<MantisToboggan> look, the whole thing was me wishing i could watch this stream in better quality like i watch everything else
<MantisToboggan> competitive gaming scene has been doing streaming longer than anyone, back before mogulus came out with the first easy service anyone can set up
<SirSprinkles> 6Mantis, we've already stated that we're working on the quality. Frankly, the quality you're watching right now is the emergency backup.
<MantisToboggan> ok that's all i really wanted anyway
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, the emergency backup of the emergency backup TO the emergency backup :P
<Aponymous> ohai Sam Jackson and Gary Oldman!
<MantisToboggan> just i was pulled into replying to stuff that wasn't correct
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty much, Val.
<DecapKing> http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/chatroulette-trolling-what-about-his-tail.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> Snoop dog?
<ReticentSmolder> I rarely watch everything at 1080p, its just not justifiable given the majority of stream sites and your average connection. The distinction for a /gaming/ site is usually that their computers are top of the line, occasionally have sponsorships, and they pay to have the convenience of a much better connection
<Darf14> These people really want to eat a cat
<RobotPinkie> Sammy J in da hizzouse
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm running a 3 year old laptop from a cafe wifi, of course the quality isn't going to be BRILLIANT.
<ReticentSmolder> ^
<Aponymous> Bye Sam Jackson!
<SirSprinkles> 6Pimp Sparrow wins.
<SirSprinkles> 6Flawless victory.
<WhatPayne> Sam Jackson said almost nothing
<WhatPayne> Something about eating and that's it...
<WhatPayne> I'd be pissed of that copout if the shooter had not been Gary Oldman
<RobotPinkie> eating the butt, no less. He's a very classy lad.
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9Mantis
<NewDCD> 9get in here
<MantisToboggan> k
<NewDCD> 9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BurningRed
<NewDCD> 9and fullscreen that shit
<Aponymous> Sam Jackson IS class.
<Nittany_Tiger> Why kill the pimp?
<Aponymous> Also, Elvis hallucination is Val Kilmer iirc.
<ReticentSmolder> that stream...is glorious
<NewDCD> 9this is not even the maximum quality we can do
<NewDCD> 9oh, the live-stream will be in this quality because I'll be advising Sumica
<NewDCD> 9however, in SD because he doesn't have Hub HD
<NewDCD> 9however, you see, there are many factors in streaming
<NewDCD> 9input size, output size, bandwidth on both viewer and streamer, and computer power on both as well
<MantisToboggan> yeah i'm aware of this
<NewDCD> 9my streamers are still learning
<MantisToboggan> but all i know is that other's do it on regular basis with no drama, which was why i asked :P
<ReticentSmolder> teach us wise one
<NewDCD> 9oh, and this quality is not attainable with other stream providers
<NewDCD> 9because 320 x 240
<Flutteryay> GUYS? New Season 2 screencap
<NewDCD> 9now maximise
<RobotPinkie> :O
<Wrek> 05Flutteryay do not tempt me :o
<Turgle_> do not want
<Darf14> Really where?
<NewDCD> 9you'll see that if you fullscreen, the quality will still remain
<NewDCD> 9I already saw it
<NewDCD> 9bowing in front of Celest, right?
<Flutteryay> on the official MLP Facebook
<WhatPayne> linky plz
<Aponymous> "I'm here because Elvis told me to kill you"
<FreezeFrame> Well, first read-through went pretty well.
<Flutteryay> https://www.facebook.com/mylittlepony
<FreezeFrame> Have to alter a few lines, though.
<Darf14> Elvis wants me dead! *runs*
<WhatPayne> Is that Gary Oldman doing Jamaican accent?
<NewDCD> 9are you satisfied, then, Mantis?
<FreezeFrame> Because we ended up with a female playing a male part
<FreezeFrame> Because there are already 3 girls for every guy on this campus
<Aponymous> Yes it is. He's a complete wigger in this movie.
<FreezeFrame> And fewer guys go for plays than girls
<RobotPinkie> So excited for S2... omfg...
<WhatPayne> That weirds me out so much...
<MantisToboggan> yes, since all i ever wanted was a "working on it"
<NewDCD> 9but yeah, we know what we're doing. Just leave it to us
<WhatPayne> Oh Gary Oldman is so good!
<RobotPinkie> Okay, then that's solved...
<RobotPinkie> Gary Oldman is some kind of minor deity.
<ReticentSmolder> we keep seeing this brown rain...wonder what episode that is
<herospirit> Is the stream supposed to be on? It isn't for me :0
<RobotPinkie> Chocolate raaaaaaaaaain

<RobotPinkie> Man, I love this scene...
<Aponymous> The BEST scene.
<Pegacorn> Aponymous,DO NOT SAY THAT WORD WHEN BJORNFOT IS HERE.
<Darf14> Dog senses tingling
<RobotPinkie> EPIC scene
<Sol> inb4 Eggplants and n-words
<Nittany_Tiger> Walken time!
<Bjornfot> That's not kinky, Aponymous

<Combustiblelemons> oh right
<Luna> 07I can pretty much go invisible without you even noticing me!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Bjorn: this is an emergency backup stream

<WhatPayne> Luna can shadowmeld me any day.
<EmmettBrown> The Galilean moons are by far the largest objects in orbit around Jupiter, with the remaining 60 moons and the rings together comprising just 0.003 percent of the total orbiting mass
<Luna> 07so who's ready for more rocky horror?
*Luna is ready
<Combustiblelemons> ME :D
<Sol> Dennis Hopper never asked for this

<Luna> 07let's do the time warp againnnnnnnnnnn
<Combustiblelemons> time warp ftw.
<RAWRity> is the stream up? I keep getting told it's offline
<RobotPinkie> I didn't watch it yesterday, Luna
<Aponymous> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<Luna> 07omg pinkie!
<Aponymous> Go there.
*WhatPayne is ready, even don't know what for...
<Luna> 07did you see it before?
<Ghosties> 4I fucking love the scene with Dennis and Walken
<Sol> Anypony who has never seen it?
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, though it's been a while
<Ghosties> 4Best part of the film, if you ask me
<EmmettBrown> I've never seen it before either
<Luna> 07any virgins in the house?
<Sol> You are in for a treat
<Luna> 07RHPS virgins that is :D
<Combustiblelemons> whats wrong with the normal stream then?
<Darf14> *raises hand* why do you ask?
<Sol> Someone threw lemons at it
<RobotPinkie> Definitely watching it today, Luna!
<Combustiblelemons> sorry ^_^
<Luna> 07great !
<Darf14> ?
<Nittany_Tiger> Virginity is fun.
<Wrek> 05Combustiblelemons someone threw a combustable lemon at it, dunno who...
<Sol> They weren't combustible though <3
<GrimGallop> I was a virgin, but you fixed that for me last night ;D
<EmmettBrown> I'd just like to say that today,I'm doing facts about the 64 moons of Jupiter
<RobotPinkie> Dennis Hopper: Master Troll
<RAWRity> huh, this is the same scene I came in on las night too.
<Sol> inb4 nword
<EmmettBrown> Jupiter's other 56 moons are irregular satellites, whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. There are 14 recently discovered irregular satellites that have not yet been named.
<Darf14> OOps I just read your full comment! I take back my raised hand
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Bjornfot> Why don't you mods just change src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=AnOccurrenceatOwlCreekBridge&amp;vw=700&amp;vh=520&amp;" to src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520&" until the normal stream is back?
<Sol> Are we popping any RHPS cherries tonight?
<Sol> *this afternoon
<Bjornfot> Now we all have to edit it manually.
<srilanga> is anybody else having issues seeing the high quality stream?
<EmmettBrown> Considering what that show is about,Sol is sounding very creepy
<RobotPinkie> srilanga: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<Combustiblelemons> I'll be back soon, off to get some pizza :D
<Combustiblelemons> which shall I get?
<RobotPinkie> That's as high as it gets today.
<Nittany_Tiger> Pepperoni and pineapple.
<Nittany_Tiger> Now I want pizza.
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Sol> Well, it is very analogious to that
<Pegacorn> brb guys
<RobotPinkie> Pepperoni and more pepperoni
<Combustiblelemons> I actually like pineapple pizza
<EmmettBrown> Saying the N word more than 4chan
<Bjornfot> no it's http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520&
<FreezeFrame> More than SRK
<Aponymous> Bacon goes with everything.
<Combustiblelemons> bacon pizza? hmm...
<Sol> Well, /b/ uses roody-poo because of filters
<FreezeFrame> Which is impressive, because half the people on SRK are black and use it all the time.
<Combustiblelemons> I'll be back in half an hour- until then :P
<RobotPinkie> SRK?
<Aponymous> "I haven't killed anybody, since 1984"
<EmmettBrown> The moons' physical and orbital characteristics vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets (Ganymede being larger than Mercury).
<Sol> The year.... OR THE STORY?!!?
<WhatPayne> Oh god this is good drink!
<Mazoot> Hello
<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: Shoryuken.com, hub for the fighting game community.
<Sol> Hullo!
<RobotPinkie> Ahh okay, FreezeFrame
<Mazoot> Are we streaming?
<Nittany_Tiger> What year was this movie released?
<WhatPayne> VioletVanilla?
<Mazoot> Ah nevermind
<Aponymous> 1993
<Sol> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<EmmettBrown> So much moon trivia,so little time to post it all in
<Sol> Go there
<Mazoot> Thanks
<GrimGallop> You'll have plenty of time to post it...
<Rainbow_Dash> The bidding actually went down on the Rainbow Dash mascot suit http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337#ht_1110wt_1270

<WhatPayne> Any Germans in here?
<Darf14> Hey, I saw that costume on a couple of forms before, its a shame I cant afford it
<Sol> Caused me to stop drinking
<MeteorVenture> too bad lauren's sketches weren't costumes
<EmmettBrown> I don't like romantic movies (mfw back to the future 3) so I'm just reading the comments on here,will turn the stream on when we get to green is not your colour
<Aponymous> I'm PART German.

<EmmettBrown> Callisto ( /kəˈlɪstoʊ/;[8] named after the Greek mythological figure of Callisto, is a moon of the planet Jupiter. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System and the second largest in the Jovian system, after Ganymede.
<Aponymous> Fun Fact.
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Octavia> 13I'm guessing the people bidding on it arent familiar with suit commissioners and such lol
<Octavia> 13And poor Luna. :(
<WhatPayne> I'm just surprised that the bid went down
<WhatPayne> And
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't even make $2.5k a month.
<EmmettBrown> mfw half of the people here have no idea about this
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<Octavia> 13Someone retracted their bid must be or something
<Sol> inb4 he gets a box of Dragon Dildos
<Nittany_Tiger> Nor have that in the bank.
<SuperBrony64> So, is there any particular reason why the Browny Show is doing a Season 1 marathon after you announced you were doing your own?
<Darf14> it must be a coincidence
<EmmettBrown> http://sharetv.org/images/back_to_the_future/dr_emmett_brown-char.jpg
<WhatPayne> Yeah that must be it. The suit was yesterday up at 3600 and 18 bids
<Sol> Because every Brony streaming site is
<Aponymous> It's an obvious thing to do for season 2 premiere.
<EmmettBrown> There was a bttf cartoon series btw
<Sol> Yes there was, I liked it :3
<Aponymous> For srs?
<WhatPayne> EmmettBrown I did not really care for that, but the movies are amongst my top ones
<SuperBrony64> So, what's this bidding war everypony is talking about?
<EmmettBrown> It was alright,kinda turned the car into a mary sue though
<Darf14> The Rainbow Dash Costume on Ebay SuperBrony64
<EmmettBrown> Nothing bad ever really happened to it
<WhatPayne> http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337
<SuperBrony64> A halloween costume?
<Darf14> Nope, not just any old costume, you have to see it to believe it
<SuperBrony64> Oh sheeeeeeeeet
<Sol> That costume has wing boners
<SuperBrony64> THAT costume
<Octavia> 13Not a halloween costume
<Octavia> 13lol
<WhatPayne> You can wear it in Halloween
<Darf14> That was my reaction when I first saw it
<SuperBrony64> Best Halloween costume ever!
<Octavia> 13You could. lol
<SuperBrony64> >_<
<Octavia> 13But its not specifically for Halloween
<WhatPayne> But it's a bit... furry
<Octavia> 13>mfw some people dont know what furries are still
<Darf14> Eeyup
<Sol> You can wear it for your Grad Bash
<Octavia> 13Holy crap, The Brony Show has over 1000 viewers
<SuperBrony64> But more importantly, if I spent that much for a costume, I would have to wear it everyday to school just to justify the price tag...
<Sol> Imagine seeing that riding a roller coaster
<Veewave> dude this guy plays Artie in Warehouse 13.
<Sol> >1000 viewers >I bet they have constant turbo chat
<SuperBrony64> I just need to figure out how to make one of those costumes...
<Darf14> same here, maybe I should find some one that actually makes them
<EmmettBrown> Not like in the canon series where it was crahsed into a barn,crashed into a cinema,had a rubbish ignition,had faulty time circuits,could only go to times between 0000 and 9999 ad,couldn't teleport,couldn't fly until the second one,was almost hit by a plane,backed into some bins,almost crashed into some flying cars going in the other direction,
<SuperBrony64> If I was rich, that would be in my closet right now
<SuperBrony64> Or on me...
<Sol> Dat late response
<SuperBrony64> Dat early response?
<EmmettBrown> Thats only the first movie and a bit of the second movie
<Sol> lol
<EmmettBrown> The car was surprisingly tough
<Aponymous> What is Floyd watching?
<Zephirdd> >mfw when my internet is so unstable that I cant watch a 0:29 vid on youtube without lagging :C
<WhatPayne> I'm a bit weird according to some since I like ponies and whatnot, but I don't think I'd wear that suit.
<Luna> 07Poor Zephirdd
<SuperBrony64> Okay, who wants to place bets that the costume goes up past $5000 before the end of the auction?
<Luna> 07hope you get it sorted out before RHPS
<Sol> Yo
<EmmettBrown> Should I continue with the time machines flaws?
<Zephirdd> It's just today
<Zephirdd> wiat, whats RHPS?
<Sol> Is it made of dark matter>
<Sol> I magical opera
<Darf14> Great going Mr loose lips
<GrimGallop> I'm working on a design for a time machine.
<SpiritShine> Arn't you guys supposed to be streaming right about now? Or is my internet just being derpy :O
<Luna> 07We are streaming
<Aponymous> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<RobotPinkie> Exactly like a ninja.
<Sol> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<Sol> ninja's
<Aponymous> Back up stream
<GrimGallop> At the moment, I'm estimating that when it's complete it will be capable of propelling the operator and up to three passengers forward through time at a rate of one minute per minute.
<Aponymous> And what a scene for you to jump into!
<srilanga> on MLP premiere day, will the stream be off site, or will it be in the field just to the left of this chat box?
<Zephirdd> one minute per minute
<Sol> It's freaky Fred!
<SirSprinkles> It will be in the field to the left of the chat.
<srilanga> thakns
<srilanga> *thanks
<SirSprinkles> 6We were having extreme tech problems today. XD
<Zephirdd> you can always put it fullscreen tho =p
<WhatPayne> Is that Tom Sizemore?
<GrimGallop> One minute per minute indeed.
<SpiritShine> The thing says it's offline :I
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…I'm hungry again…but I JUST ate last night...
<SirSprinkles> 6We have backups upon backups upon backups.
<Aponymous> It's James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano)
<Zephirdd> backupception
<RobotPinkie> SpiritShine: Click this http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<Natleyn> When did the replay stream start? o-o;
<Luna> 07so.. for those who stayed after last nights show... how was the playlist?
<srilanga> i plan to make it fullscreen, but (and not complaining) the borders on the other stream make the actual movie kinda small
<Natleyn> Luna, it was amazing
<Luna> 07it was?
<WhatPayne> Oh right, I was thrown off by the shadows/slightly laggy stream
<Darf14> It was good, I was dozing off a lot so I didn't watch most of it
<Luna> 07I believe I kept playing till 5 PM my time
<Natleyn> I was only there for the after show stream
<SuperBrony64> Luna: OMG, the ending of the playlist was brutal
<Luna> 07brutal?
<WhatPayne> And because Sizemore was supposed to be in this movie
<sklar> why is stream down?
<Luna> 07my internet derped
<Bjornfot> LIKE A BOSS
<Bjornfot> http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520& SKLAR
<SuperBrony64> Luna: The music just got really weird and some bad remixes of Pony songs played
<Luna> 07nice Bjorn
<SuperBrony64> Luna: No offense to your personal tastes though
<Luna> 07weird?
<Luna> 07it's not even my list ;)
<Luna> 07it's just a list with over 200 vids
<sklar> Bjornfot but the chat isnt there.
<SuperBrony64> Luna: Okay then, the list had some bad remixes near the end
<SuperBrony64> Beginning was good, but the end was just rape on the ears
<EmmettBrown> It's gotten struck by lightening,driven by biff,struck by lightening again,got left in a mine for 65 years,got shot with an arrow,ripping the fuel line,pulled by horses over bumpy terrain,damaging it's suspension,had to share a cave with a bear pushed by a locomotive,crashed through a barrier,and hit by a train
<Luna> 07i'm sorry
<Luna> 07I can't edit it
<RobotPinkie> Just pop out the chat from bronystate.net, sklar
<Bjornfot> sklar: edit the page HTML
<Luna> 07but if you suggestions we do have our own playlist too
<SuperBrony64> Luna: It's cool, thanks for playing it all night though
<Aponymous> I lol'd at driven by Biff.
<Bjornfot> search for the iFrame where the stream is
<Bjornfot> change the src to http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520&
<WhatPayne> EmmettBrown that last part might have done some damage
<EmmettBrown> old biff as well
<SuperBrony64> Luna: what's the link to the playlist?
<EmmettBrown> I'm not even finished with it's punishment
<FreezeFrame> Out to go work out
<Natleyn> Bye Freeze
<Aponymous> "Oh yeah, did I mention Elvis told to murder a pimp once?"
<Sol> I'm pretty sure I'm mistaken, but is that Crispin Glover? Or whoever played Marty's dad?
<EmmettBrown> a put that apostrophe there to annoy the grammar nazis :D
<RobotPinkie> No, that's not him.
<Tony> it didn't crash did it?
<Sol> OK, thanks
<Nittany_Tiger> That guy should have killed Alabama instead of screwing around after he found the coke.
<RobotPinkie> Thought it was William Sadler, but I guess not.
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…I don't know whether or not to spoil myself with the marathon of MLP now or just wait for the all-nighter before Season 2 comes out...
<SuperBrony64> Nvm, Bronyville show is just crapping out every given moment
<Darf14> He took that hit like a boss
<SuperBrony64> Internet is broke today
<Wrek> 05holy bejeezus

<sklar> man cant wait for the marathon
<SuperBrony64> I can't see anything...
<Purple`Prose> Hi all
<RobotPinkie> Marathon will be too late for me :(
<Aponymous> Clarence married a hooker, killed her pimp and stole an ass load of cocaine, they moved to california to sell it and now the mob is after them.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Purple`Prose!
<Purple`Prose> What's the selection for next week?
<SuperBrony64> That blonde girl is a bitch
<EmmettBrown> its been struck again with lightening,found by me in the year 2025,crashed through a billboard,fixed by a doc from a different timeline butgiven faulty time circuits again,hit doc,stolen by Edna,been dismantled by Edna and finally chased by its counterpart from another timeline been erased from time
<SpiritShine> ...I think I'll wait for the next movie
<SuperBrony64> Blade Runner and My Little Pony: The Movie Purple
<Darf14> Cop: I can hear you yelling you know
<EmmettBrown> that last part happens in the new game
<Dermathil> ITS FLOUR
<Riders> Which cut of Blade Runner
<Purple`Prose> Beautiful!
<Sol> Problem, officer?
<RobotPinkie> Ohay Mr Officer, I work at a bakery
<Nittany_Tiger> It's Pinkie Pie sugar!
<Bjornfot> MLP: The Movie is my fault.
<Combustiblelemons> hello all
<SuperBrony64> Riders: The pure cut?
<Purple`Prose> The pure cut?
<EmmettBrown> There's a brand new bttf game out,and ritics say that it captures the essence of the movie perfectly :D
<WhatPayne> Oxymoron?
<Sol> And I applaud you for it
<SuperBrony64> So, what happened with the main site stream Luna?
<Sol> You're a true bro
<Combustiblelemons> I got some pizza :D
<EmmettBrown> More moon trivia!
<Nittany_Tiger> The trailers never showed any gameplay of the game.
<Darf14> No officer it was hers, she threw at me to frame me
*Purple`Prose has an idea for an End of Winter celebration
<Riders> Director, Theatrical or Final?
<WhatPayne> Now that's Tom Sizemore
<Purple`Prose> We should do a three-day showing fo the Toy Story Trilogy.
<SuperBrony64> Great movie indeed
<EmmettBrown> allisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only about a third of its mass.
<WhatPayne> Hey Jayne_Cobb
<RobotPinkie> You mean Callisto, right?
<SuperBrony64> Applejack is in da house everyone!
<EmmettBrown> yep
<Combustiblelemons> *happy music plays*
<Combustiblelemons> ohai applejack
<Applejack> Howdy everpony
<SuperBrony64> PONY TIME
<Darf14> What Sim City taught me is to never build a residence near an airport
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<WhatPayne> Hellew
<SuperBrony64> >_<
<Natleyn> Hiya Applejack
<Darf14> Hi AJ
<Aponymous> ohai Applejack
<Aponymous> and Jayne_Cobb
<Combustiblelemons> darf14: I built homes next to them anyways :P
<SuperBrony64> DON'T FORGET MOURNINGSTAR EVERYONE!
<Rarity> But what about...RARITY!
<SuperBrony64> Can't forget about him/her
<WhatPayne> I don't think I've ever seen Jayne_Cobb speak here...
<MourningStar> whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
*Natleyn hugs Rarity, careful not to ruffle her mane
<Aponymous> Rarity? second best Pony is here?
<EmmettBrown> The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa.
<MourningStar> somepony sees me...wow
<SuperBrony64> RARITY IS IN DA HOUSE!!
<SuperBrony64> Now it's a party
<Combustiblelemons> It's not a party till pinkie pie arrives
<Twilight_Sparkle> Well, it's not a party without pinkie. Anypony see her lately?
<SuperBrony64> inb4 PinkiePie enters the room
<EmmettBrown> Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.
<Twilight_Sparkle> I guess she's just being Pinkie Pie
<Aponymous> And Dick Richie went on to become the single most celebrated actor in the history of film!
<Darf14> He got the part, well there goes that studios money
<WhatPayne> Ohey, Fluttershy is here too.
<Fluttershy> o-o I've been here kinda...
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy is being really shy :P
<Fluttershy> I mean... um
<Fluttershy> I am here...
<Fluttershy> I just... haven't really been talking... ^^; sorry...
<GrimGallop> Fluttershy's always here.
<Aponymous> So many ponies, I wish they had seen the movie from the beginning.
<Combustiblelemons> flutterlurker?
<Fluttershy> um...
<Ziltoid> hey brownies
<SuperBrony64> All the Mane 6 Ponies are lucky
<Natleyn> Hiya Ziltoid.
<SuperBrony64> They know what happens in Season 2 >_>
<Aponymous> ohai Ziltoid
*EmmettBrown whistles the Back to the Future them tune
<WhatPayne> I'm not a bakery product
*GrimGallop vanishes for a while
<Fluttershy> ....to the new lunar republic...
<Darf14> so...who's the guy that hired these cops?
<derpyderpderp> ...
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy: Lunar republic…? IS THAT FROM SEASON 2!?! :O
<Combustiblelemons> the cops are just cops that somehow know about this cocaine
<Combustiblelemons> nope.avi
*Natleyn highhooves Fluttershy
<Aponymous> They interrogated Elliot after he got busted. He told them the bs story Clarence told him.
<Purple`Prose> how long's this movie been going?
<Fluttershy> >3> -highhooves Natleyn back-
<WhatPayne> A while
<SuperBrony64> This is near the end
<Aponymous> It's almost over.
<Darf14> There so much tension in this movie, so we decided to play some peaceful music...relax...
<Fluttershy> SuperBrony64: huh? o-o;
*EmmettBrown whistles the Thomas the tank engine them song
<Purple`Prose> This show could only be more star-studded if it was Twilight's flank.
<Combustiblelemons> about 10-15 more minutes left
<WhatPayne> Yeah, what's up with this music?
<Aponymous> The music makes sense at the end, kinda.
<Combustiblelemons> their music department had a low budget?
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy: You know, the second year that you are friends with the Mane 6
<Fluttershy> SuperBrony64: I mean... well, I know that... ^^; oh dear...
<SuperBrony64> I still don't understand this scene
<Natleyn> SB64, New Lunar Republic is an internet thing
<Aponymous> Clarence knows somethings wrong, but he's a little too trusting of Elliot.
<Combustiblelemons> He thinks something is amiss due to his suspicious smile
<SuperBrony64> I don't get it...
<SuperBrony64> What the hell just happened?!
<Combustiblelemons> so he presses him with a gun to get him to talk
<Combustiblelemons> he lied.
<Fluttershy> SuperBrony64: Look it up... it's very fun. :3
<Ziltoid> Bong time
<WhatPayne> What just happened?
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy: The Lunar Republic?
<Darf14> Douche!
<RobotPinkie> Clarence just happened.
<SuperBrony64> Best part is when the one thug cocks the shotgun
<Combustiblelemons> Reminds me of my neighbour lol
<WhatPayne> Lunar Republic is best republic.
<EmmettBrown> Heres a picture of Callisto http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Callisto.jpg
<SuperBrony64> Callisto looks like a moon...
<Darf14> No wonder this guy doesn't have friends, he tells about there secrets and you all know that loose lips sing friendships
<Wrek> 05Darf14 +1 for refference
<Fluttershy> Luna: I think I might have started something... o-o
<Aponymous> "One of 'em just put a gun to my face, we're real good friends."
<SuperBrony64> http://tinyurl.com/3ojttu5
<Darf14> oops made a slight spelling error
<EmmettBrown> he surface of Callisto is heavily cratered and extremely old. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts.
<Purple`Prose> This dude is just so chill
<Dermathil> Um, question for the mods: during the viewing of Rocky Horror Picture Show, can we shout the lines that are usually shouted at late night viewings?
<Ghosties> 4I dunno, Dermathil
<Sol> Can we have toast and squirt guns as well?
<Wrek> 05"two bodybags"
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<SuperBrony64> Dermathil; What late night viewings?
<Aponymous> He's descended from The Bear Jew from Inglourious Basterds.
<Dermathil> SuperBrony64: the late night viewings of RHPS
<Dermathil> the legendary viewings with the disguised people
<SuperBrony64> Dermathil: They still have those? Is it like a cult?
<Rarity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZgfCblZDWk
<Dermathil> I think they do
<SuperBrony64> Rarity: Why would you record yourself laughing for 10 minutes?!
<Rarity> SuperBrony64 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWCucX_haV0
<Combustiblelemons> she's very vain?
<WhatPayne> that noise
<Darf14> 10 minutes huh...If I can survive a hour of Nyan I can survive that vid!
<SuperBrony64> Rarity: Now you just trollin' -__-
<SuperBrony64> Twilight no like True Romance?
<SuperBrony64> Oh I see why now...
<Dermathil> anyway, lines here: http://www.badmovies.org/movies/rockyhorror/audience/
<Rarity> mfw domain is "bad movies"
<Dermathil> the previous link says what to do, and the lines begins here http://www.badmovies.org/movies/rockyhorror/audience/audience_pg01.html
<Darf14> is this link virus free?
<SuperBrony64> Dermathil: I can't believe people are that dedicated to that movie to do stuff like that
<Riders> This film has been brought to you by the letter F.
<Aponymous> Shits about to get REAL.
<SuperBrony64> HERE COMES THE GOOD PART!
<SuperBrony64> HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL
<SuperBrony64> Now then, can anyone explain the guy in the gold outfit?
<SuperBrony64> I missed the beginning
<Combustiblelemons> Toilet elvis
<Dermathil> SuperBrony64, people have always done that kind of stuff. The audience participation is half the experience.
<Darf14> I think its the ghost of Elvis
<Riders> The word of the day is Fuck kids
<Aponymous> He's Elvis, he's Clarence's spiritual guide. (Clarence is a little crazy)
<SuperBrony64> Dermathil: So you bring stuff to throw at the screen and shout random stuff?
<Rarity> Dermathil Ya, it's like "Sweet Caroline"
<RobotPinkie> Well if you hate fucking cops, then just don't fuck 'em. Seems easy enough.
<SuperBrony64> I wonder what the backstory for that was
<Dermathil> SuperBrony64: there are even theaters that GAVE bags of the items to throw
<Darf14> Cops vs Body Guards vs Mafia, for people who haven't watch this place your bets!
<Riders> It's like watching a Fuck-Shit stack on top of itself
<SuperBrony64> Dermathil: Really? Do they still do this today?
<Aponymous> ALWAYS bet on Clarence.
<Dermathil> I dunno, maybe
<Combustiblelemons> -clarence's drug trip-
<RobotPinkie> Indeed, Aponymous!
<EmmettBrown> Are we all really useful engines?
<SuperBrony64> Officer DIMES!
<Darf14> Wise words from Elvis
<SuperBrony64> Is Elliot really that stupid?
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<Aponymous> Yes he is.
<RobotPinkie> Indeed.
<Combustiblelemons> Everyone dies. the end.
<SuperBrony64> I can't believe those cops go in there without any bullet proof vests...
<Combustiblelemons> elliot killed them all.
<Dermathil> JUST LIKE A SHAKESPEREAN DRAMA
<Nittany_Tiger> Party time!
<GrimGallop> I can't believe it's not butter
<SuperBrony64> NO NOT CLARENCE!!
<RobotPinkie> Screw u, this is much better than Shakespeare :P
<Wrek> 05...And then they all walked the dinosaur.
<Combustiblelemons> Clarence will become big boss :P
<Aponymous> Fluffy deaths everywhere.
<SuperBrony64> Is this the part where we throw rice at the screen?
<Riders> This isn't shit hitting the fan. This is the whole damn cesspool hitting it
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: you haven't seen Julius Caesar if you say that.
<GrimGallop> No, this is where we throw feathers
<GrimGallop> And bullets
<Veewave> Cops win.
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't see Clarence get shot.
<Darf14> Its only a flesh wound
<Riders> It's raining feathers
<SuperBrony64> THE GUY HIT THAT DUDE
<Aponymous> Dat italian.
<RobotPinkie> So very John Woo.

<scatr> (there is a stream on now right? up top it says show time but for me it says cast offline)
<Aponymous> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
<SuperBrony64> Stream on site doesn't work, use link
<EmmettBrown> Callisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of approximately 1 880 000 km (26.3 times the 71 492 km radius of Jupiter itself).
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6j8EUOJEi8 <-- Stereoscopic ponies!
<Aponymous> Go there Scatr
<Sol> Movies almost over
<Sol> Then ponies
<Sol> and delishuz RHPS
<scatr> ah k
<WhatPayne> EspyLacopa, that's really awesome.
<Purple`Prose> Dat Tarentino Monologue
<scatr> taht's good cos i only came for rocky horror :3
<Aponymous> "You're so cool."
<Darf14> I am seeing double of everything
<Combustiblelemons> >this part is stupid
<Combustiblelemons> "you're so cool"
<SuperBrony64> Okay, PONY TIME
<EspyLacopa> Imagine the entire pony episode in 3D.
<RobotPinkie> >this part is awesome
<WhatPayne> Whoa
<Darf14> It needs to be 20% more cooler
<Combustiblelemons> lol elvis
<WhatPayne> I'd like to watch pony ep 3D
<Combustiblelemons> Brad pitt is big boss.
<WhatPayne> Even through I'm against 3D movies
<scatr> ponies in 3d would basically be the same as 2d
<SuperBrony64> I just killed my eyes watching that clip
<scatr> given that they are 2d creatures
<EmmettBrown> I can list the first 10 engines from thomas the tank engine in order of number :
<Wrek> 05The rigging and anitmation needs to be solid. even slightly off and id prefer 2D
<EmmettBrown> :D
<Wrek> 05animation*
<Ziltoid> IMMMMMMAAA FIRUN MAH LAZOR
<SuperBrony64> Scatr: BUT IN 3D
<Ziltoid> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S5aBzSBegoo/Tmu49tRdR3I/AAAAAAAAL4o/5tvlsrtrhOU/s1600/h1zC.jpg
<EspyLacopa> Threeeeee-Deeeeee
<Riders> I'm kinda pissed that I missed the first half of this movie
<scatr> lol
<Aponymous> Now it's really awkward when Clarence says "Elvis told me to kill a pimp."
<Combustiblelemons> I prefer 2D animation too.
<RAWRity> scatr actually 2D stuff can look pretty good in 3D if done properly.
<SuperBrony64> PONY TIME THEN TIME FOR ROCKY HORROR!
<Darf14> I have a feeling that someone is going to do a chocolate rain skit with that episode
<scatr> true i guess
<Combustiblelemons> 3D is significantly easier though- thats why there's more 3D cartoons out there.
<scatr> actually 3d parasprites would be pretty freaky
<RAWRity> darf14 as if they haven't already with the 3 screenshots we have of it.
<Combustiblelemons> Darf14: its a certainty after what seth said.
<scatr> but if it was in 3d all the colours would be dark and murky and ponies is all about colour :<
<WhatPayne> Of course 2D is still the way to go, but for the novelty's sake I'd like to see one entire episode in 3D
<EspyLacopa> I'm not talking about that. This 3D is the kind where the stuff actually pops out of the screen.
<SuperBrony64> 3DS 3D
<Wrek> 05depends on the shader scatr
<WhatPayne> I could watch youtube cross eyes 3D whole pony ep
<SuperBrony64> MLP on the 3DS would be really cool
<SuperBrony64> WhatPayne: I'm sure your eyes would melt after that
<scatr> i guess what i'm thinking of is the 3d in ceinmas where you pay bullshit amounts for stupid glasses
<Combustiblelemons> I want to get OoT on DS
<scatr> but then imax 3d is way better
<RAWRity> scatr that's if it's a 3D conversion. Proper 3D doesn't have the murky effect, that's why stuff like "How To Train Your Dragon" looks effing brilliant in 3D
<scatr> so
<WhatPayne> For ponies I'd do it
<Combustiblelemons> Ocarina of time was my all time favourite :D
<EspyLacopa> Pffffft, This needs no glasses.
<WhatPayne> Yeah that glasses stuff is bs
<SuperBrony64> Combustiblelen: I've got that game on 3DS. Really awesome game, just like original except better >_<
<Combustiblelemons> It is? I'M GETTING IT :D
<Luna> 07I was wondering... why the chat was dead... my chat did not scroll down >:
<scatr> wtb virtual reality ponies actually
<scatr> lol luna
<RobotPinkie> Glasses always darken the video, though it doesn't have to be by a whole lot.
<scatr> i know that feel
<Darf14> It could be a delay luna
<EspyLacopa> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/196/8/0/802fee5782b8aad603c9543202e9f4cd-d3rukq0.png <-- 3D image
<EmmettBrown> Thomas,Edward,Henry,Gordon,James,Percy,Toby,Duck,Donald,Douglas and Emily :p
<EmmettBrown> The first 11 engines
<Darf14> So...how does the 3D work?
<RAWRity> darf14 friendship
<RobotPinkie> Magnets
<Combustiblelemons> 3D is a trick of the eyes
<SuperBrony64> This is Pinkie Pie's favorite show
<EmmettBrown> I'm getting a 3DS when my old DS lite breaks
<RAWRity> friendly magnets
<Mac> Luna lol, this has happened to trixie before
<RobotPinkie> Naw, 3D usually works through polarized light.
<Octavia> 13 3D'S! How do they work?!
<Combustiblelemons> I'm nostalgic for the old days where you had red and blue lenses
<scatr> afraid i don't really see it espy :<
<SuperBrony64> Octavia: Magic
<Darf14> So my eyes have to be like Derpys eyes in order to see the 3D in that picture
<scatr> colours are good obv
<EmmettBrown> Which is soo,the top screen keeps turning off
<Combustiblelemons> the 3DS is weirdly awesome
<SuperBrony64> How long till Pony episode starts?
<RobotPinkie> unless you have one of those 3DTVs that require LCD glasses, then it works by alternating which eye can see something.
<Aponymous> I want a 3Ds
<Combustiblelemons> who's streaming?
<RAWRity> One thing that DIDN'T need to be brought back was that Aromascope stuff
<SuperBrony64> Luna is I believe Combustiblelen
<scatr> isn't the 3Ds the thing that melts your eyeballs
<RobotPinkie> SirSprinkles is streaming, Combustiblelemons
<Combustiblelemons> Thought so.
<SuperBrony64> scatr: If you want to believe that
<Combustiblelemons> ah thanks robotpinkie :P
<Combustiblelemons> its all going on the same stream channel right?
<Natleyn> No scatr, you're thinking of the Virtual Boy
<scatr> dw, i'd endure eyeballmelting to play a lylat wars update superbrony :3
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Natleyn> 3DS reports are mostly of headaches.
<SuperBrony64> Virtual Boy kicked ass and was killed off before it hit its prime
<scatr> that too natleyn
<RobotPinkie> VirtualBoy did work by melting your eyeballs, true
<RobotPinkie> anyone who's ever tried one can confirm this
<Lucky_Charms> I've never tried. I always wondered what they were like
<Combustiblelemons> I'll keep my old DS then I think :P
<SuperBrony64> I own one and can't confirm this RobotPinkie :P
<Riders> SuperBrony64 = You trollin?
<Sol> Dat cone
<RAWRity> for some reason I'm having trouble concentrating on my NaPoWriMo fic today.
<Combustiblelemons> I hate it when games consoles go down in price
<RobotPinkie> 3DS is great, though.
<Combustiblelemons> like 1 week after you brought it
<EspyLacopa> the picture I linked? Look at it crosseyed until you see extra versions of the two parts in the middle, then focus on the single middle image.
<SuperBrony64> Riders: Hell no, I'm dead serious, the 3D effect was not that bad
<scatr> big respect for anyone doing napowrimo
<Darf14> Waiting for a certain game until I actually buy a 3Ds
<RobotPinkie> You have a virtualboy, SuperBrony64, and you don't think it's headache inducing?
<scatr> that shit's hard even when you can write at a decent rate
<Centigrade> Just joined, what are we watching?
<Natleyn> robot: whatdimensionhavewestumbledinto
<Riders> I've played a virtual boy before. It was graphically hideous and was a horrible eye strain
<RobotPinkie> okay, you're one of the exceptions, then. I couldn't play for a minute without my eyes tearing up.
<Darf14> We are watching a traffic cone
*Luna is watching a traffic cone
<Combustiblelemons> I very rarely get headaches
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<scatr> centigrade: nothing atm, ponies next, then TIMEWARP
<scatr> (rocky horror)
<RobotPinkie> 3DS is fine, though, just don't overdo the 3D slider
<Luna> 07Let's do the timewarp againnnn
<Lucky_Charms> great
<Lucky_Charms> now that song is stuck in my head
<scatr> its just a jump to the left!
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Nope, it makes your eyes tired after a while but not melt your eye balls
<Combustiblelemons> Seems everything epic is coming out this september :D
<RAWRity> I think I'll skip Rocky Horror today. It was fun for a bit, but just started getting boring after a while
<RobotPinkie> lol you thought I literally meant it melts your eyeballs?
<SuperBrony64> I really like the 3DS' 3D effect better though
<Bjornfot> ^
<SirSprinkles> 6So... Green Isn't Your Color is up next.
<Bjornfot> 3DS isn't painful at all
<SpiritShine> I watched a little bit of rocky horor last night ._. It was so weird...
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: No lol, I'm saying that it doesn't kill your eye sight unless you are really young
<Luna> 07rocky horror is amazing
<Combustiblelemons> Meh. not a fan of green isn't your color
<SpiritShine> I'm not even sure how it's a horror movie...
<scatr> nintendo: we can't work out how, but the general consensus is that eyeballs will be melted at some point
<Lucky_Charms> who needs eyeballs anyway?
<Lucky_Charms> they're overrated if you ask me
<SpiritShine> It was fun to watch though
<RAWRity> I don't plan on getting a 3DS. I'm sticking with my DS Lite and it's GBA slot thanyouverymuch.jpg
<RobotPinkie> I'm not saying it kills your eye sight either, but it is a constant strain
<SuperBrony64> Lucky_Charms, if you don't have eyes then you don't get to see Ponies
<Bjornfot> Nintendo: We are currently building a consensus. Please try again later.
<Combustiblelemons> as am I RAWRity
<SpiritShine> Disregarding the mind rape
<Lucky_Charms> ...true :-(
<Darf14> Rocky Horror was good at the beginning, but it get progressively...um....odd
<scatr> lawl
<Pegacorn> lol Bjornfot
<Purple`Prose> FABULOUS HAT
<RobotPinkie> 3DS isn't, unless you've got the 3D slider set too high
<Combustiblelemons> GBA slot is genious.
<SuperBrony64> But Nintendo is really pulling an epic fail out of their hat with what they are doing with the 3DS
<scatr> oh look, ponies!
<Veewave> Goodbye.
<Riders> I was only after the 3DS for Megaman Legends 3. Now that Capcom can go fuck themselves, I have no reason to buy it.
<RobotPinkie> Whuh? How is 3DS epic fail?
<Octavia> 13Photo Fish
<SuperBrony64> http://technobuffalo.technobuffalo.netdna-cdn.com/files/2011/09/3DS-Extra-Circle-Pad.jpg
<Darf14> Pony time!
<Combustiblelemons> *squee*
<SuperBrony64> This has been confirmed by Nintendo to be real
<Octavia> 13She saw my hat and said it was absolutely hat!
<scatr> this episode is one of the best, mostly because of photo finish
<Thunder_Dash> Been idle for a long time because schoolwork, but re: 3DS - the problem I have with it is that often (for me at least) is that I stop noticing the 3D unless it starts doing strange things
<Wrek> 05*SQUEE*
<Darf14> Oh look the 3Ds just grew a tumor
<Silverscreen> Looks like 3DS is starting down the path of the Sega Genesis.
<Riders> Dat please
<Combustiblelemons> octavia: Rarity would love TF2
<RobotPinkie> So that's an official addon?
<Darf14> Correction, the Sega Game Gear
<SuperBrony64> THE USUAL!
<EspyLacopa> Silverscreen: That thing reminds of the monstrosity I got for my game gear.
<Riders> Rarity = best customer ever
<Purple`Prose> Aloe and Lotus <3 Rarity
<Natleyn> It's only 'cause they're adding another analog anyway...
<Silverscreen> Do you remember how many add-ons they made for Genesis?
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Indeed, it is being revealed officially September 13th at a 3DS Press Conference
<EspyLacopa> Sega CD?
<EmmettBrown> The ancient surface of Callisto is one of the most heavily cratered in the solar system
<Thunder_Dash> At least three
<Silverscreen> Wait, why a third movement control?
<Riders> Oh god the GameGear sucked
<RobotPinkie> Well.... that sucks
<Purple`Prose> Masochspike!
<Lucky_Charms> they also had the ingenious idea of connecting cartridges XD
<Darf14> Lets see, the Sega CD, 32X...those are the ones I remember from the top of my head
<Thunder_Dash> Sega CD, Sega 32X (or whatever it was called) and an adapter for SMS systems IIRC
<RobotPinkie> I don't get it either, doesn't the touch screen work just fine?
<SuperBrony64> I think Nintendo is having an identity crisis with the 3DS
<Riders> Why does Fluttershy look like a burlesque dancer
<Combustiblelemons> Fluttershy hates spike
<Aponymous> I still have a GameGear...
<Zephirdd> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/35049680bf201fd2f4c220e0ffa10b74/56172%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20artist%3Aalfa995%20cmc%20comic%20crossover%20nuke%20nyx%20scootaloo%20starcraft%20starcraft_2.jpg
<Zephirdd> awesome.
<Natleyn> 360, PS3, ect: two analogs, dpad
<SuperBrony64> Combustiblelen: No, she loves Baby Dragons :P
<Wrek> 05yfw i dont own any kidn of console
<Silverscreen> But the DS has a touch screen that functions as a second analog.
<Combustiblelemons> she got to know spike, now she hates him.
<SuperBrony64> OMG
<scatr> consoles are srs bsns
<SuperBrony64> SPOILER ALERT GUY
<SuperBrony64> GUYS*
<scatr> (< pc gamer)
<Natleyn> Foreeeeevarrrr
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, but the 360 and PS3 don't have a touch screen.... I mean 3D shooters work much better that way.
<Darf14> *gasp*
<Purple`Prose> And thus a meme was born
<scatr> FOTO FEENEESH
<Combustiblelemons> Anyone else nostalgic for the GBA?
<Thunder_Dash> I never would've expected that
<Natleyn> <3 Photo Finish
<Purple`Prose> Oh hi Rainbow Dash
<WhatPayne> I'm born again PC gamer
<Riders> Now
<Natleyn> <3 Flootershai
<Combustiblelemons> photo finish is underrated D:
<RobotPinkie> I still play my GBA, Combustiblelemons
<Riders> No!
<SuperBrony64> YES!
<Wrek> 05mhyees
<SuperBrony64> NO!
<SuperBrony64> YES!
<Combustiblelemons> I keep forgetting to buy batteries for mine D:
<SuperBrony64> ENOUGH
<Aponymous> Photo Finish should show up in season 2, at least her theme song should.
<RobotPinkie> I have a GBA SP, yay!
<scatr> more ponies with euroaccents are required for season 2
<Thunder_Dash> I do too, I can't remember where I put it though
<RobotPinkie> just need to plug it in to charge it, ooh yeah
<scatr> because they're always done so ridiculously over the top
<Riders> We Go!
<Combustiblelemons> Lost my charger for my SP D:
<SuperBrony64> Rarity Smile!
<Aponymous> I still have an original GBA, I had to buy an awkward light for the screen.
<Darf14> I still have my SP, but the battery only last about a hour and thirty minutes
<Thunder_Dash> I GO
<RobotPinkie> You can buy a new charger really cheap, though, Combustiblelemons
<SuperBrony64> Ow ow ow ow
<RobotPinkie> I'd say it's worth it.
<Darf14> Thanks RobotPinkie :)
<Combustiblelemons> I bet- after seeing a GBA on sale for £2 at a car boot sale
<Natleyn> I haven't charged my SP in years and it still turns on. <3
<Purple`Prose> Whenever I see Photo Finish, I can't NOT see her as a disguised Rainbow Dash
<Purple`Prose> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48918?search=rainbow_dash%20photo_finish Thanks to this comic
<RobotPinkie> Pokemon Emerald, Link to the Past, Castlevania games, oh yeah!
<Thunder_Dash> haha, I know right @Purple`Prose
<Combustiblelemons> Pokemon emerald FTW.
<Wrek> 05natöre
<WhatPayne> Purple`Prose, same here. Ever since I saw that comic, I have not been able to unsee that
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, that comic is awesome
<RobotPinkie> I need to buy FF6 for GBA though...
<Darf14> The last Pokemon game I last played was silver for the GBC
<Purple`Prose> Camera Flash Burn
<Combustiblelemons> I bought pokemon white. I got to some city and saw a dress up game. after that I ragequit
<interior_gummy> where's the movie?
<scatr> alternatively, photo finish is disguising as rainbow dash most of the time
<Natleyn> Wait, what Wrek?
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<SuperBrony64> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/56275 :<
<Natleyn> FLOOTERSHAI
<Darf14> LOL at the comic
<Natleyn> De magicks
<Aponymous> That comic has fucked my mind. You NEVER see Photo Finish and Rainbow Dash in the same place! Think about it.
<Purple`Prose> Wunderbar!
<Combustiblelemons> Even MLP can't lower my standards to what is girly.
<Thunder_Dash> And RD herself shows up all of, like, once

<EspyLacopa> It's Trixie!
<Aponymous> I hate Po- I can't even jokingly type that. I LOVE PONIES!
<Combustiblelemons> >dash's 2 seconds in this show
<Thunder_Dash> It just dawned on me; shouldn't Hoity Toity recognize Fluttershy in the first place?
<Darf14> wow, I am behind
<RobotPinkie> YAY!
<Zephirdd> On a cross and Arrow
<Combustiblelemons> I hate ponies. IRL ponies.
<Zephirdd> is it finished?
<Purple`Prose> Depends on when the episode takes place
<scatr> most of it is, i think that there's gonna be a prologue/end part zephirdd
<Zephirdd> is it good? :P
<Purple`Prose> *EYE-TWITCH*
<RobotPinkie> I can't eat gelatine anymore... goddamn you, ponies...
<Thunder_Dash> Well, on the clothes rack Rarity has you can see the Gala dresses she made in Ep14, so...
<Sol> BONBON
<WhatPayne> Bon Bon's voice...
<Darf14> Man, Bon Bon is a jerk
<Nittany_Tiger> Watching the Penn State v. Alabama game is depressing.
<scatr> it is good - it's not amazingly written but it's really really entertaining and it's a good story done well
<Combustiblelemons> Applejack eats marshmallows robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Combustiblelemons> >contains gelatine
<Thunder_Dash> I mean, they use the same dresses earlier in Ep10, so it might not even mean anything
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: But you can eat cupcakes still, right? *evil look*
<Sol> olol Gaga pony
<Riders> Rarirage

<Natleyn> Bon-Bon's voice just makes the OTP make more sense.
<SuperBrony64> DA MAGICKS
<Riders> We Go!
<scatr> what does OTP stand for anyway? :<
<RobotPinkie> Those are ACTUAL marshmallows, Combustiblelemons, our marshmallows only contain gelatine so they're easy to mass produce :P
<Thunder_Dash> one true pairing, scatr
<Purple`Prose> Off-Topic Pairing
<Combustiblelemons> Not all gelatine is pony hooves.
<scatr> ahhh
<scatr> alrgiht
<Purple`Prose> Wow, tell us how you really feel Rarity
<Sol> So marshmallow

<scatr> what's up for next week?
<Natleyn> Espy WHY
<RobotPinkie> Yes, MLP: The Movie...
<RandomExtra> Blade Runner and MLP: The Movie
<RAWRity> scatr The 1986 My Little Pony movie
<EspyLacopa> My Little Pony, the 80's movie. Complete with Smooze
<Darf14> Twilight cant Pinkie Pie swear
<Combustiblelemons> Bjornfot is such a troll.
<Thunder_Dash> Well, by that I meant when Pinkie popped out of the basket :P
<Riders> Cartoon deconstruction

<Aponymous> Bjornfot = New Tacowiz

<EspyLacopa> Epic trolling by Bjornfot
<Darf14> + 1 dead puppy
<Combustiblelemons> how many bronies will we lose during MLP movie
<Thunder_Dash> I think mine's behind by a bit
<RobotPinkie> Seriously epic trollan, I'm lovin' it.
<Sol> None
<Thunder_Dash> !
<Combustiblelemons> well it can't be as bad as <censored> can it?
<Sol> I'm eating an apple too
<RobotPinkie> Juicy!
<EspyLacopa> Trollan? Isn't that an alien race from the Stargate series?
<Riders> In my mind the Smooze will forever be a Doctor Who cosmic entity resurrected by Carrionites
<Sol> It's as juicy
<Aponymous> Next week there will be more rage than Spider's Web.
<Combustiblelemons> mm juicy n_n
<Bjornfot> PROBLEM BRONIES
<SuperBrony64> THERE'S TROLLIN A FOOT?!
<Thunder_Dash> SHOO BE DOO, SHOOP SHOO BE DOO

<Nittany_Tiger> Meep meep meep

<EspyLacopa> ...What the hay. Disgaea crossed with My Little Pony?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just real quick during our little intermission here guys.
<Ghosties> 4...I really wanna play the new Deus Ex
<Ghosties> 4Fucking criken, I had no interest in the game until I saw his video -_-
<Ghosties> 4And now I want to play it
<SirSprinkles> 6First off, we will be streaming all of Season One next week, starting after the stream on Friday night, so that it will end on Saturday before the new season airs.
<SirSprinkles> 6Secondly, I'd like to point out for those of you who do not already know.
<SirSprinkles> 6That we are now on our own new, permanent domain.
<SirSprinkles> 6At http://www.bronystate.net
<Luna> 07yay!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Hurray for domains!
<Luna> 07Also a marathon! so much ponies!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Stay up with us.....FOOORRRREEEEEEVEEEERRRRR
<SirSprinkles> 6And, as we've taken a little trip across the internet, we'd like to think of it... as our own little BronyQuest.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 toot
<Combustiblelemons> Ghosties: Exactly the same thing happened to me.
<Sol> I never asked for this
<Dashite> Toot
<Bjornfot> TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT

*Luna is ready!
<typjk> awww yeah
<scatr> win
<Dashite> Ghosties, you totally should play it. :D
<WhatPayne> This is new?
*Ghosties 4is tempted to just go by Gamestop today and pick up a copy
<Darf14> this one is good
<Octavia> 13Dat Flutterguy
<Combustiblelemons> I'm more than tempted to pick up a copy
<Darf14> no
<FlutterBro> How is this? http://s902.photobucket.com/albums/ac223/CCXIII/Minecraft%20Bronies/
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: You should pick up a copy of Star Fox 64 3D
<scatr> this one's pretty well done actually
<Combustiblelemons> if only my ps3 wasn't only 40gig :/
*Ghosties 4does not own a 3DS
<Darf14> He should get a copy and DO A BARREL ROLL!
<WhatPayne> I have had my Deux Ex sitting right next to me in wraps as I have been pushing playing it until my new RAM arrives...
<Combustiblelemons> Meh I just want to kill people with vending machines.
<WhatPayne> Ever since it's release
<scatr> and no pinky trumpet in sight!
<scatr> oh
<scatr> wait
<scatr> disappoint
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: :<
<FlutterBro> No feed back?
<Combustiblelemons> Also, stealth games are generally epic.
<Combustiblelemons> Case and point: MGS series.
<scatr> rofl louder
<Ghosties> 4But this is different, you guys
<scatr> (this is when toot comes in right)
<Ghosties> 4I can just punch people FOR NO REASON and there's an epic animation for it
<Dashite> You can't bait me with MGS talk Combustiblelemons! I see Ghosties in chat...
<Pegacorn> MGS
<Pegacorn> MGS
<WhatPayne> :D
<Octavia> 13MY LITTLE PONY!
<FlutterBro> I'm not getting a broadcast.
<SuperBrony64> Time for food break, brb everyone
<Combustiblelemons> Recommend to everyone- get MGS4. It's not too late.
<Pegacorn> MGS
<Pegacorn> MGS
<scatr> this > chickenquest > pinkiequest
<scatr> callin this right now
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Darf14> I am impressed that someone only took small sound clips from different part and was able to make a song out of it
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just intermission, dude, we're going to the next ep now.
<Natleyn> thirding
<Octavia> 13Scootaquest <3
<Ghosties> 4Indeed
<Ghosties> 4MGS4 is art
<Natleyn> <3
<Sol> That was fun
<Octavia> 13That chicken sure gets around I tell ya
<Combustiblelemons> it's like half movie half game.
<Combustiblelemons> And it does it SUCCESSFULLY.
<scatr> i just had reheated applecake superbrony
<Nittany_Tiger> I have MGS4.
<Pegacorn> inb4 MeatLoaf
<Ghosties> 4My only complaint is that there wasn't more action. However, the ending completely made the entire effort worth it
<Pegacorn> WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYinb4 MeatLoaf
<Natleyn> Luna o3o
<Nittany_Tiger> I need to get another hi-def TV.
<Purple`Prose> O hai woona
<Ghosties> 4It was like 10 years of build up finally coming to a neat wrap
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe I'll go and buy one today.
<Darf14> Since its a half movie half game make sure you get popcorn
<Riders> Oh hai Luna. How's your sex life
<Pegacorn> dat The Room
<Natleyn> inb4Don't use your fancy mathmatics to muddle the issue
<Nittany_Tiger> Sound is choppy.
<Purple`Prose> wat?
<Combustiblelemons> It also tied up all the weird crap in MGS2
<Darf14> Screw math!
<WhatPayne> Ohey there's going to be MGS HD collection
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't finished MGS4.
<Octavia> 13>muddying up the issue with dem fancy mathematics
<Purple`Prose> Even if it kills me...
<Combustiblelemons> what are you stuck on nittany?
<WhatPayne> And finally I get to play Peacewalker
<Pegacorn> GOOD LUCK DUMB SHIT
<Darf14> Can't play MGS4 for one sole reason...no PS3
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not stuck. Just haven't picked it back up.
<Combustiblelemons> :( poor darf14
<scatr> >mfw i realised that this is the reason Big Mac is so good at accounting in that hueg fic
<Nittany_Tiger> Can't really play it on a CRT TV because I can't read the text.
<Darf14> The only MGS game I ever played was the remake released from the GC
<WhatPayne> Darf14, that can be problematic
<Combustiblelemons> The end of part 4 of MGS4 is epic.
<WhatPayne> Oh, Daf what have you missed...
<WhatPayne> *Darf
<Natleyn> inb4chineseearthquake
<Natleyn> awww.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm on Act 2.
<Thunder_Dash> ebrbrbrbrbrbr
<Combustiblelemons> Act 4 is my favourite act.
<Pegacorn> CAPTAIN BACKWOODS TO THE RESCUE
<Combustiblelemons> Act 3 is my least favourite.
<Nittany_Tiger> No spoilers.
<Nittany_Tiger> Spoilers in MGS are fatal to gameplay.
<Combustiblelemons> I won't spoil it for you :P
<scatr> is there a low-quality option on the veemi.com stream?
<Nittany_Tiger> Like spoilers killed KOTOR for me.
<EmmettBrown> doncha know
<Combustiblelemons> Just saying, you'll love part 4.
<RobotPinkie> I still need to play MGS4
<Darf14> Phew, almost got caught -_-;
<Combustiblelemons> Caught watching ponies? No fear for me tonight :D
<Darf14> yes
<Combustiblelemons> No roommate, no problems.
<Nittany_Tiger> I live alone for now.
<RobotPinkie> and I love MGS: Twin Snakes, Darf14
<EmmettBrown> I'm watching Thomas the tank engie on youtube :p
<Natleyn> I'm watching ponies with headphones so I don't bother my brother, but I'm not hiding that I'm watching.
<Purple`Prose> inb4 I Came Paper
<Combustiblelemons> SO AWESOME
<SirSprinkles> 6 /)^3^(\
<Nittany_Tiger> My brother is going to live with me for a while. It's going to be interesting when he learns about my bronyism.
<RobotPinkie> Cut scenes directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Oh yeah.
<Combustiblelemons> damn it sprinkles D:
<Darf14> Good thing I only keep my pony stuff on a different Partition
<scatr> thing about pony stuff and other people finding out is
<Riders> Dat Grin
<Pegacorn> KANYESHY
<Octavia> 13I CAME PAPER!
<EspyLacopa> Ohai Mayor
<scatr> that it's legitimately a good cartoon. so if they're open minded enough to watch it in the first place, they're probably open minded enough to like it
<Pegacorn> Lol
<Nittany_Tiger> The only "open" pony stuff I have out is my PS3 theme, and it won't show up for my brother.
<Thunder_Dash> My dad's out right now, and my mom's going to be in England for the month, so I could use my speakers if I wanted to, but I don't feel like it cause I prefer headphones
<Purple`Prose> SHE'S GONE
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless he logs in as me.
<scatr> and it's getting big enough for people to be less "lol ponies???" because they're probably heard of it. so it's not as big a deal as it used to be imo
<Purple`Prose> This is the SECOND time Mayor Mare lost the guest of armor
<EmmettBrown> It was proposed that it could be possible to build a surface base on Callisto that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.[54] Advantages of a base on this moon include the low radiation (due to Callisto's distance from Jupiter) and geological stability.
<Purple`Prose> honor*
<scatr> they've*
<Nittany_Tiger> But he's not interrupting my Friday BMN.
<Combustiblelemons> New lunar republic is discreet enough for me :P
<EspyLacopa> Wooo wooo!
<Natleyn> whoo whoo
<Ghosties> 4<Combustiblelemons>: The end of part 4 of MGS4 is epic
<Ghosties> 4What he said
<SirSprinkles> 6High?
<Darf14> AppleJack has got to lay off the AppleJack *punched*
<WhatPayne> EmmettBrown, you're really on with the Callisto thing, aren't you?
<Combustiblelemons> Nobody knows its pony related except for a real brony.
<EspyLacopa> Beware the smooze, AJ.
<Nittany_Tiger> EmmettBrown: I hope we do before we fry ourselves with overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.
<EmmettBrown> Got it's wikipedia page open on nother tab and everything
<scatr> every pony is best pony whenever they undergo a mental breakdown
<EmmettBrown> In a December 2003 report, NASA expressed belief that an attempt for a manned mission to Callisto may be possible in the 2040s
<Natleyn> Everypony is best pony at all times forever. @.@
<Nittany_Tiger> NASA can't get the money to get back to the moon.
<Combustiblelemons> lazy twilight unnecessarily teleports.
<Darf14> Pinkie so far has the best mental breakdown scatr
<WhatPayne> I really do wish humanity would really expand to space.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know Combustiblelemons
<scatr> agreed darf
<WhatPayne> *mankind
<EmmettBrown> Of course,living on Callisto would be harder than living at the south pole
<Nittany_Tiger> Humanity wants to bitch over resources on Earth to have them in the here and now.
<Nittany_Tiger> And the US govt can't get along to fix the economy.
<Combustiblelemons> >invest money in space travel
<Thunder_Dash> MOON TOURISM.
<Combustiblelemons> >resource problems over.
<WhatPayne> I really want to visit L2
<Nittany_Tiger> Convince humanity that.
<scatr> but... wouldn't rainbow be launched *into& the tower
<EmmettBrown> Anyway,that's Callisto triviafied
<EmmettBrown> onto Europa
<Nittany_Tiger> :Cheaper to continue using resources on Earth. Screw space travel.
<Natleyn> Physics details.
<Natleyn> pff
<Combustiblelemons> Pretty easy. Saturns moon, Titan is covered in natural gas.
<Darf14> 4 fails in a row
<EmmettBrown> Europa or Jupiter II, is the sixth closest moon of the planet Jupiter, and the smallest of its four Galilean satellites, but still one of the largest bodies in the Solar system.
<Riders> You're Whale Cum!
<RobotPinkie> Oh no, Dash died :(
<EspyLacopa> Dash is blasting off agaaaaiiin!
<RobotPinkie> There's a zoo near Ponyville, confirmed.
<RobotPinkie> I wonder if there's a petting zoo with ponies
<scatr> yeah i was just wondering what the implications of a zoo in equestria would be
<Combustiblelemons> Twi DGAF about rainbow dash.
<scatr> given that every animal is either rampaging through the everfree forest or in the care of fluttershy
<Nittany_Tiger> Equestrian petting zoos have humans.
<scatr> more or less
<Purple`Prose> Who's a silly pony?
<Nittany_Tiger> And mules.
<scatr> lol nittany
<RobotPinkie> You are, Purple`Prose!
<Natleyn> Applejacks caught the derp
<scatr> volunteers wanted for human petting zoo - meet real ponies
<Purple`Prose> ^_^
<EmmettBrown> Maybe fluttershy lives at the zoo?
*Purple`Prose isa silly pony! :D
<Nittany_Tiger> Losta mule discrimination in Equestria.
<Combustiblelemons> Stoned AJ
*RobotPinkie hugs Purple`Prose
<RobotPinkie> I like silly ponies.
<scatr> gimme piiiizzzaaaaaa
<Purple`Prose> :D
<Combustiblelemons> Why doesn' pinkie pie intervene >.>
<Riders> RobotPinkie = It's super effective
<Purple`Prose> Because she's busy paying attention to the book
<Natleyn> >cup of lemons
<RobotPinkie> That recipe is... not very good... even if followed...
<Natleyn> >everything explodes
<Combustiblelemons> I'm in that muffin
<Riders> You gotta do the cooking by the book
<Combustiblelemons> I'm toxic.
<scatr> >mfw derpy has a wingboner over muffins
<Darf14> Muffin
<Nittany_Tiger> Derpy-approved muffins!
<Sol> MUFFIIIIN
<Thunder_Dash> inafterMUFFINS
<Natleyn> I want muffin spectacles.
<Darf14> The horror
<Bjornfot> TRIVIA: Horses can't throw up.
<Purple`Prose> most adorable thing ever
<Darf14> Bjornfot knows everything
<Combustiblelemons> They're ponies bjornfot ^_^
<Nittany_Tiger> I love how The Mentally Abridged Series passes this episode off as AJ having a drinking problem.
<Riders> It's like an upside down turtle with a protruding shell
<Bjornfot> we have horses, darf14
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Ponies also can't cast magic or fly
<scatr> i think you're beating a dead.... horse
<Wrek> 05neitehr can they control their flank muscles, ie they cant control when to shit.
<scatr> OSHI
<Darf14> Wow, thats kinda cool
<Bjornfot> i even know what a horse dick looks like up close
<Octavia> 13.. tree
<Octavia> 13Doh ho ho
<Natleyn> ^Why would you say that
<Purple`Prose> ...why do you know these things?
<Natleyn> @Bjorn, I mean
<scatr> guessing you work with horses bjorn
<EspyLacopa> Triple Negative ahoy!
<RobotPinkie> ...please don't tell us you know what it tastes like :(
<prince-dari> ^ LOL
<Bjornfot> horses regularly unsheath their penises to "ventilate" them
<Combustiblelemons> Wrek: o_o really?
<Nittany_Tiger> Mule: "Biding our time for the revolution."
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and we're done with that subject
<Natleyn> Applejack: Pick up that can.
<Apokalipse> Bjornfort being best fort...
<Bjornfot> you have to clean a horse's sheath at least once a month
<Combustiblelemons> Run from bunnies?
<Bjornfot> lots of nasty stuff get in there
<Darf14> What have you done AJ!!!
<scatr> oh the huge manatee
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Bjorn- no more please
<EspyLacopa> Attack of the killer rabbits!
<RobotPinkie> sound suddenly derps for me...
<Combustiblelemons> Meh I'd act like gandalf in this situation
<prince-dari> Damn Bjornfort, too much information.
<Combustiblelemons> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
<Bjornfot> wat
<Darf14> Hide your Kids! Hidy your Wife!
<Bjornfot> it's perfectly normal
<Bjornfot> you silly city-folk...
<Pegacorn> lolwut
<Nittany_Tiger> Meep meep.
<prince-dari> Not if you don't look after horses.
<prince-dari> Like most people.
<prince-dari> :P
<Darf14> My gosh.....
<SirSprinkles> 6AWESOME ALLITERATION!
<Zephirdd> It's also perfectly normal that your grandmother has sex
<scatr> still dude i'd rather not think about it whilst watching cartoon colour ponies
<Zephirdd> do you want to hear the details?
<Zephirdd> :|
<prince-dari> ^ LAWL
<Wrek> 05Combustiblelemons yeh
<Bjornfot> :I
<Bjornfot> THERE'S NOTHING SEXUAL ABOUT CLEANING A HORSES DICK
<Zephirdd> *facehoof*
<scatr> of course not but we don't wanna think about it >_>
<prince-dari> Not really the point.
<Nittany_Tiger> But it isn't PG-13.
<Purple`Prose> Never needed no help from nopony no-how, not till now.
<Combustiblelemons> AJ's face then reminds me of happy tree friends.
<Octavia> 13Big Mac = Trololol
<Darf14> Dang, looks like I am behind the stream again
<RobotPinkie> I will save that quote for future usage.
<Thunder_Dash> Big Macintroll
<Bjornfot> if you think it is, you have a really perverted mind
<scatr> so... how big mac got his injury
<scatr> he lost a bet
<scatr> but we don't know what the bet was?
<prince-dari> Bjornfot: [22:41] <scatr> of course not but we don't wanna think about it >_>
<Purple`Prose> Fluttershy doesn't need to buck trees. She has The Stare
<Bjornfot> ok ok, i'll stop
<Luna> 07ARE YOU READY?
<Darf14> Twilight just cheated!
<EspyLacopa> scatr: The bet was in another episode.
<prince-dari> HAX!
<Combustiblelemons> It was to wear granny smith's corset I think scatr
<Nittany_Tiger> Twilight cheats.
<Purple`Prose> Granny smith's Girdle
<RobotPinkie> MYBODYISREADY, LUNA!
<scatr> luna: MY BODY IS NOT READY
<Riders> Purple`Prose = That's because the trees know better
<SuperBrony64> BAck!
<Thunder_Dash> It was in Ticket Master, yeah
<Combustiblelemons> Girdle that's it.
<SuperBrony64> DID I miss the beginning?
<SirSprinkles> 6INCOMING ROCKY HORROR
<Combustiblelemons> What's a girdle.
<Luna> 07YES!
<RobotPinkie> You're just in time, SuperBrony64
<Purple`Prose> It's kinda like a corset
<scatr> lemons/espy: i guess so. don't see how wearing a girdle would lead to broken bones
<SuperBrony64> What episode played?!
<Octavia> 13Oi. XD
<SuperBrony64> :<
<Octavia> 13Janet!
<Pegacorn> Damnit Janet
<Purple`Prose> It's for slimming the waist
<SuperBrony64> J-A-N-E-T Time!
<scatr> also - is there a low quality version of the stream? still kinda laggy for me?
<Nittany_Tiger> Spike wants to poison everyone.
<Pegacorn> Janet.
<SuperBrony64> What episode of MLP played?
<Combustiblelemons> perhaps he tripped over whilst wearing it?
<Nittany_Tiger> Applebuck season
<Purple`Prose> Applebuck Season and Green Isn't Your Color
<EspyLacopa> Let's do the time warp again!
<Purple`Prose> AND NOW, LIPS

<Sol> ARE YOUR BODIES READY?
<Janet> 07oh yes YES YES YES YES YES YES
<EspyLacopa> prince-dari: It is never too soon for time warp.
<Combustiblelemons> OF ALL TIME
<RobotPinkie> I want to lick Tim Curry's lips
<Bjornfot> Ok, what's so special about this film? I've never even heard of it before.
<SirSprinkles> 6I suddenly want Dairy Queen...
<scatr> here we goooooo
<Spirit> Is it mind rape time? :o
<SuperBrony64> Bjornfot: Oh you will see
<RobotPinkie> You'll see, Bjornfot ...
<Apokalipse> I've never seen this film.
<Bjornfot> ...
<SuperBrony64> I never saw it before yesterday and now I understand :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo You've never herd of Rocky Horror Picture Show?
<EmmettBrown> Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and probably has an iron core
<Thunder_Dash> What SuperBrony said. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Do you live in a cave?!
<herospirit> Oh no... It's back

<Dermathil> hey, can I get a link to the time warp pmv?
<Sol> SQURIT GUNS
<ChefMKT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3skUmfydYU
<EmmettBrown> Time is a part of the measuring system used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change such as the motions of objects.
<Combustiblelemons> before the gala. Definitely.
<scatr> i still don't get where the time warp actually cam in, but then i barely followed the plot at all
<scatr> came*
<Darf14> On the net 3 weeks is old, a year is ancient
<Dermathil> Not THAT old! Only August
<Combustiblelemons> the gala had tons of useful PMV footage.
<herospirit> Do we have PMVs of EVERY SONG IN RHPS?
<prince-dari> We need to watch Legend.
<Pegacorn> I wonder where Bjornfot went.
<prince-dari> It has unicorns and Tim Curry.
<prince-dari> Epic win.
<Sol> 90s is Paleolithic
<R-Zack> On the net 3 months is old.
<Sol> 60s is big bang
<R-Zack> 3 weeks is average.
<Sol> Anything before that is never mentioned
<Apokalipse> Bjornfot went to clean up bits of his brain that exploded from watching the movie probably
<Combustiblelemons> The ponies celestia fired from her moon cannon are returning!
<Pegacorn> Oh.
<Sumica> and horn guy Dari

<Dermathil> OH FK THIS IS THE FULL SONG
<Silverscreen> 11I hate to sound like a hater...but this singer's voice is annoying.
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Darf14> DARF SMASH!!!
<Sumica> Oh is that song, I think this is the first time I heard it.
<Nittany_Tiger> MY HAND IS A DOLPHIN!
*Dermathil nukes his headset

<Natleyn> ^
<R-Zack> Change the song?
<ChefMKT> Not going to lie
<Thunder_Dash> I can't stop laughing oh my god you guys
<RAWRity> this reminds me of "Friendship is Witchcraft" where they have Pinkie playing a polka version of friday
<R-Zack> Not even ponies can make this song cool.
<Sol> I feel Rapidash right now
<Silverscreen> 11CombustibleLemons: Exactly.
<Pegacorn> MUST MOCK REBECCA BLACK'S CHORUS VOICE!
<SirSprinkles> 6EVERYBODY'S RUSSIAN
<Natleyn> PLEASE, CELESTIA SWITCH IT TO AUTOTUNE
<ChefMKT> Whoever made this didn't even put any thought to the clip usage either
<Darf14> Even with Ponies it cant make the song better!
<Sol> It's Fry Day!
<Combustiblelemons> everyone's seen that friday parody I take it
<Silverscreen> 11Hell, I'd prefer hearing the Chipmunks sing this.
<Nittany_Tiger> Throw them in a car and drive it off of a cliff!
<ChefMKT> Today it is void rays
<Darf14> Did she fried egg?
<Sumica> So what was the big deal about this?
<scatr> >mfw when i still haven't heard her new song

<Thunder_Dash> > Sunday
<Combustiblelemons> after listening to it so many times it's like rickroll
<Thunder_Dash> > After Saturday
<Combustiblelemons> you don't mind it.
<RAWRity> what's sad is, Rebecca Black isn't this awful a singer. They actually autotuned her OUT OF TUNE.
<scatr> i think so nittany, don't remember what it's called
<Darf14> Correction Rebecca, today is Sunday
<Nittany_Tiger> It's called My Moment.
<Sumica> Yeah it's bad but not oh my god I must kill it with fire bad.
<R-Zack> Autotune = You shouldn't be singing
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, she can actually sing, which is weird.
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Combustiblelemons> damn it
<mib_wu45si> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> Friday has awful lyrics.
<Darf14> I mean Saturday *facehoof*
<R-Zack> Sounds like they are using Sarah Palin
<Sol> T-Pain makes Auto-Tune cool at least
<RobotPinkie> LAWL
<Nittany_Tiger> And is part of the most corporate-controlled genre in the industry.
<mib_wu45si> @-R-Zach yes
<Sol> And Auto-Tune The News
<RAWRity> >mfw they pulled the original Friday vid with millions of views.
<R-Zack> Funny how many people call me Zach at times
<Combustiblelemons> They pulled it?
<Nittany_Tiger> Friday has millions of dislikes.
<Combustiblelemons> :o
<Sol> Yeah
<scatr> i knew that they turned off comments rawrity but i didn't realise they got rid of it
<Darf14> Old news Combustiblelemons
<Sol> The dislike bar was red a a pimple about to blow like a volcano

<RAWRity> maybe this will make more sense in context next week?
<Darf14> smooze, good gosh I still remember there names
<EspyLacopa> The smooze is horrifying when you stop and think about what it is and does.
<Dermathil> Bjornfot knows his stuff. BEST PART RIGHT THERE
<Thunder_Dash> THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Silverscreen> 11okay...
<R-Zack> Ending:
<Darf14> Smooze, the retarded cousin of Muck
<R-Zack> THEY ALL DIE.
<Silverscreen> 11what the fuck were they thinking when they came up with this?
<herospirit> I already wrote a couple Grimdark paragraphs about the Smooze
<Combustiblelemons> This is pretty grimdark
<Dermathil> EspyLacopa, that's why it would look fking epic if remade by the fim team. Just let that think.
<Combustiblelemons> Lets kill them all!
<Silverscreen> 11Better yet, what the fuck were they smoking? I'd like some.
<Dermathil> Think of it remade in the new art style.
<prince-dari> You want to have the Smooze in your head Silver?
<Sumica> They wanted a non threatening bad guy that was easy to draw Silverscreen
<Combustiblelemons> They were smoking some smooze.
<Natleyn> I... I'm glad I'm a pegasus
<Thunder_Dash> Me too
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Flutteryay> Me three
<Pegacorn> I'm getting bored.Maybe gonna play some L4D2,or TF2.But not right now.
<EspyLacopa> Natleyn: Good thing Pegasi can stand on clouds, eh?
<Darf14> Advantage, Pegasus Pony
<RAWRity> I'm glad I own a hot air balloon
<Silverscreen> 11Sumica: So they went with Grimer's retarded cousin?
<Dermathil> Silverscreen: they made a [SPOILERS] blow up to make the smooze. And even in the G1 style it looked FKING AWESOEM
<Combustiblelemons> UMAD smooze?
<EspyLacopa> They just have to worry about starving to death when the smooze eats all the food on the ground.
<Natleyn> Better than drowning, imo.
<Sumica> Yep, time line wise they may have inadvertently designed pokemon.
<scatr> ok no more pony tonight, bye guys, thanks for the stream and chat!

<EspyLacopa> Ah, Avenue Q.
<Combustiblelemons> oohhhhh this!
<Thunder_Dash> It's not even, "Who can we ship RD with?", it's "/What/ can we ship RD with?"
<Silverscreen> 11Where is this from?
<Zephirdd> If you were Gay ~~ That'd be okay ~~ I mean cuz hey ~~ I like you aaanyway
<Dashite> It's okay to be Takei.

<Natleyn> Sweet Luna
<RAWRity> it's a broadway stage show...with PUPPETS!
<Sol> PSh, my childhood died with My Immortal
<Natleyn> The amount of nostalgia in Super Filly
<Octavia> 13Theyre an awesome musical group
<EmmettBrown> From that picture,we can detirmine that the engines are take apart (which feels like having your legs,arms and skin torn off) when they are no longer useful
<Sol> It's Sesame Street for adults
<MegaPony> megas xlr
<Dark_Heart> yepo
<Sol> It's a musical
<R-Zack> Eeyup
<Darf14> lol
<Ziltoid> aeiou

<Sol> SCHADENFREUDE
<Silverscreen> 11XD

<Zephirdd> if you WERE gay!
<Silverscreen> 11Schadenfreude
<Neponig> Somepony should make a broadway of that with the pony costumes from ebay.
<RAWRity> GERMAN WORD I CAN'T SPELL
<R-Zack> RAAA
<Dark_Heart> this is really nice
<Flutteryay> I love this song.
<Sol> This song taught me how to spell Schadenfreude
<RAWRity> neponig that would make it stop being funny, and make it start being terrifying
<SuperBrony64> GILDA CAN GO ROT IN HE
<SuperBrony64> HELL*
<Bloodstarz> Indeed
<Bloodstarz> She made my darling cry T_T

<Sol> lol, Problem Bronies?
<Sol> inb4 colors 4 mods
<Neponig> RAWRity yeah, true, sorry
<R-Zack> Meh, I don't care how Gilda Acts
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't like Gilda's voice.
<Sol> I thought Trixie was worse, tbh
<Sol> inb4 shitstorm
<Silverscreen> 11...
<MegaPony> silver screen it's the streaming or is my connection that is working bad??
<Silverscreen> 11This...this song makes too much sense.
<EmmettBrown> Is seth listening?
<Darf14> This song makes sense
<Combustiblelemons> what ghosties said
<RAWRity> Trixie was obnoxious, but at least she was entertaining with her bullshit. Gilda was just a jerk because kicks.
<Sol> That is the magic of Avenue Q
<Ziltoid> Seth is always listening
<Combustiblelemons> oops silverscreen*
<Silverscreen> 11MegaPony: It's probably your connection.
<Sumica> tragedy is when i stub my toe comedy is when you fall off a cliff and die
<Flutteryay> I think Trixie would be very hot if she kept her whore mouth shut
<RDash> Sol I hated Trixie in the show, the fandom made me love her :P
<MegaPony> ok thanks
<Rainbow_Dash> If Sethisto is listening. I have a request for him.
<Rainbow_Dash> =P
<Sol> Go watch it Silverscreen, I think you'd like it. There's a camrip on YT IIRC
<Zephirdd> RDash: me too! :D
<Flutteryay> OK, there are some fanfics that make me like Trixie
<prince-dari> I hate when fanon influences people. >_>
<Combustiblelemons> I don't like trixie. Never will like her.
<SuperBrony64> lol
<Zephirdd> man
<Zephirdd> this is my fav
<Apokalipse> yeah me too
<Neponig> Gilda had a right to be that way, she hadn't seen RD for a really long time and wanted some time alone, and Pinkie Pie was being annoying :s
<RDash> lol
<SuperBrony64> What do you do with a B.A. in English/
<Combustiblelemons> as do I dari :/
<R-Zack> LOL
<EmmettBrown> LET'S WATCH OLD THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE EPISODES]
<R-Zack> Paid for this
<Sol> Easy: firewood
<EmmettBrown> Actually,I typed the wrong show
*Silverscreen 11smacks EmmettBrown
<Apokalipse> Neponig that's a terrible excuse
<R-Zack> Silverscreen, heh
<EmmettBrown> I meant to say "Teletubbies"
<Silverscreen> 11no
<RAWRity> neponig yeah, she really wanted to be along with RD, that's why she shouted at Fluttershy over an accident when she was alone.
<Flutteryay> I hate when fanon influences people too
<Darf14> Cake moster
<SuperBrony64> Silverscreen, you can't just keep smacking people!
<SuperBrony64> Friendship is Magic!
*Silverscreen 11smacks SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> Ouch
<Apokalipse> hahaha
<Rainbow_Dash> inb4 someone else gets smacked
*Nittany_Tiger attaches to Silverscreen and explodes
*Dashite slaps Silverscreen around a bit with a large trout
<Sol> Fanon made Pinkie a sociopath >:
<Zephirdd> IT SUCKS TO BE ME!
<Apokalipse> silver is such a troll
<Zephirdd> IT SUCKS TO BE ME!
<Zephirdd> IT SUCKS TO BE ME!

<Sol> inb4 Flutterfuck
<Nittany_Tiger> I have acute Silverscreen
<SuperBrony64> You read it? Didn't you?
<DecapKing> Fluttershy is being a troll
<R-Zack> haha
<Nittany_Tiger> I think it's feeding off of me.
<Zephirdd> Flutteryay: sorry bro, while it is a really bad concept, the writting was brilliant
<Zephirdd> it's NOT a shame
<Silverscreen> 11Nittany_Tiger: I hate it when they use Self Destruct. :P
<Rainbow_Dash> Silverscreen, I hope you arent a zombie. I have been playing Dead Island for 2 days
<Darf14> Everyone's life sucks in some way
<DecapKing> so have I
<SuperBrony64> Ironing your underwear lol
<Rainbow_Dash> What do you think of it DecapKing?

<SuperBrony64> >_>
<Ziltoid> lawl rarity is asian
<Zephirdd> YOUR RIVES SUCK? I HEARING U CORRECTRI?
<RAWRity> Really, Cupcakes is more ridiculously hilarious than scary or creepy. Then again, it's hard to scare me after seeing "A Serbian Film" and "I SPit On Your Grave"
<SuperBrony64> It sucks to be Gary Coleman
<R-Zack> Suckasuckasuckasucka-
<Nittany_Tiger> Sucka sucka sucka.
<EmmettBrown> OLD THUNDERBIRDS EPISDOES!
<Nittany_Tiger> What is this based on?
<Zephirdd> Avenuq Q
<Zephirdd> Avenue Q*
<EspyLacopa> Gary Coleman?
<Sol> Stories don't scare me easily. Visuals and music are key to scaring me
<RAWRity> AND NOW I'M DEAD
<RAWRity> sol then DON'T watch "A Serbian Film"
<Zephirdd> IT SUCKS TO BE YOU!
<SuperBrony64> If I ever see Gary Coleman, I'd tell him that
<Sol> Trust me, I won't. I hate horror
<SuperBrony64> Just to mess with him
<Pontang> Newborn Pr0n. lawl
<Dark_Heart> The moral, All our lives suck
<RAWRity> superbrony64 tell him that in hell, seeing as he's dead.
<Dark_Heart> so be happy
<DashWithRainbows> .
<Darf14> I know how to talk to Gary Coleman *pulls out soul golve* stand still...
<SuperBrony64> Oh right, forgot *facehoof*
<R-Zack> Haha
<Apokalipse> I like older horror film. Like the original dracula

<SuperBrony64> LUNA HAS JOINED PRINCESS CELESTIA'S PARTY
<prince-dari> "Will you accept my friendship?"
<prince-dari> "NO!"
<Sol> LET'S WATCH NEW THUDERCAT SERIES
<Apokalipse> aww that scene is so awesome
<Combustiblelemons> why is luna half the size of celestia?
<Bufurd> lol @ prince-dari 's comment
<R-Zack> Luna gets hugs everyday?
<R-Zack> :S
<Dark_Heart> lets watch something epic
<Sol> I think the infection stunted her growth
<Darf14> Sadly that moment was short lived when Celestria used the moon canon on luna
<Zephirdd> Luna gets hugged
<RAWRity> there's som damn good screamo out there. Like Orchid, Pg.99, and Amanda Woodward
<Zephirdd> whenever we remember to hug Luna
<Sumica> Yes R-Zack
<Bjornfot> You can all go fav it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JafGnlH6jXU
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<EmmettBrown> The moon is smaller than the sun
<Combustiblelemons> 1,000 years on the moon- is not fully grown.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hope you like bananas.
<R-Zack> Doesn't it feel a bit tedious for her at times
<Apokalipse> Celestia has too much growth hormone...
<Natleyn> Yay~
<Combustiblelemons> what is this.
<prince-dari> Not this again.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> :P
<Dashite> Celestia has been taking steroids?
<Bufurd> arrg this gets everywhere
<Combustiblelemons> haven't heard this before D:
<Darf14> MP3'd this song
<RAWRity> this is Flutterwonder
<Apokalipse> No, growth hormone
<prince-dari> This is meh.
<Combustiblelemons> thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou
<Neponig> ...Name of song, anypony?
<RAWRity> I was so glad when FLuttershy actually got her own song.
<Sol> Flooterwunder
<Dark_Heart> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqo53-pNxsE
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Apokalipse> Dari wants live action ponies, not this
<Natleyn> Flutterwonder.
<R-Zack> Luna just got younger due to the fact she grew up with a bitter heart.
<EmmettBrown> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599xiSGk2NM
<R-Zack> As TIME himself reversed her.
<herospirit> Anyone know how to get the blank flank ending in Super Filly Adventure?
<Bufurd> Lets listen to Something Broke by George DesRoches because 20 min story songs are awsome
<R-Zack> To the most previous part when she was not evil.
<Sol> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSO0JQdyM8s&feature=related.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> meh I prefered nightmare moon
<Ziltoid> I wonder if theres gonna be a song in the S2 premier
<Combustiblelemons> she had an awesome design
<RAWRity> herospirit you can only get it between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. Talk to everybody multiple times, just don't go to the party after all invitations are given, then go to Zecora
<Ziltoid> That would be so awesome
<Combustiblelemons> ...luna's still good though :L
<Natleyn> So much meh in this room
<Apokalipse> Luna's awesome
<Flutteryay> Why wub Wuna
<GrimGallop> Lol @ Sol
<herospirit> Wait, between 11:00 and 5:00?
<RAWRity> yes.
<Zephirdd> LOL sol
<DashWithRainbows> @Sol that just made my day
<Bufurd> ARRG
<Neponig> I love you, sol
<SuperBrony64> How do I get the secret ending in Luna Game?!
<Combustiblelemons> Dark matter butterflies!
<Rainbow_Dash> Herospirit, change your system time, and prepare yourself a new pair of pants
<RAWRity> somebody went through the code for it and found that stipulation
<Dark_Heart> so is this Fluttershy night
<Sol> Pony House makes everything better
<Combustiblelemons> doctor house ^_^ yay!
<herospirit> I'll just wait until 11:00 I guess.
<Flutteryay> Why wub Fwuddershy
<Ziltoid> Fluttershy is best pony
<herospirit> Welll.... nah I'll change my clock
<Combustiblelemons> 2:00 AM.
<DashWithRainbows> >Everypony is best pony
<DashWithRainbows> deal with it
<Apokalipse> I agree
<Flutteryay> true that
<prince-dari> Dash is best pony.
<prince-dari> Deal with it.
<Combustiblelemons> Dash will always be #1 for me ^_^
<Bufurd> i guess there is no requests
<RobotPinkie> Well, most ponies are best pony
<RobotPinkie> I exclude ponies like Prince Doucheblood
<herospirit> Is the ending THAT frightening Dashie?
<Sol> Any bad ends in the VN?
<Bufurd> Dash is overrated imo
<Combustiblelemons> the "how abooouut" gets annoying in a short space of time for me.
<RAWRity> Dari, I just don't know how you keep managing to misspell Rarity
<RAWRity> herospirit it IS pretty messed up.
<AllisZero> Phew, what a day.
<AllisZero> Hello everypony

<AllisZero> Hi RP
<AllisZero> Bought the car, finally
<RAWRity> it's called "Pinkie Pie Swear-Trixie's good side"
<Neponig> It's catchy but the "what" and "how about" really ruin it tremendiously for me\
<RobotPinkie> You know I am, Luna :P
<AllisZero> Coughing and sneezing, but I did
<Combustiblelemons> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGs7cPJM5tw&feature=related
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
*Zephirdd hugs Luna just because

<AllisZero> I like this song, about as much as I don't like Trixie
<Combustiblelemons> KoTH anyone?

<Dark_Heart> O.O
<Apokalipse> exploding sounds painful
<RDash> Combustiblelemons love that one
<Nittany_Tiger> Not really.
<Zephirdd> my
<Zephirdd> ears
<Silverscreen> 11What did you want to discuss, Ghosties?
<Dark_Heart> what about exploding twice?
<Combustiblelemons> as do I. my favourite pmv.
<Ghosties> 4I already asked you, Silver
*Natleyn explodes twice and retires to a dark corner
<Ghosties> 4Best Sonic music, what is it?
<prince-dari> [02:19] <Ghosties> Best Sonic music, what is it?
<SuperBrony64> Sonic Boom? Ghosties
<RAWRity> it's kind of amazing how much has been done with the limited amount of Trixie footage
<Thunder_Dash> Ghosties; Green Hill Zone, otherwise it wouldn't have gotten 23 million remixes like it has
<Sol> Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
<Thunder_Dash> :P
<Silverscreen> 11I can die faster than you.
<Silverscreen> 11hmm
<Darf14> I can watch ponies longer than you!
<Sol> Ohhhhhhhhhhh, I get it
<RDash> RAWRity Trixie does talk a lot in that episode though :P
<Apokalipse> Okay, I should probably go now. Bye everypony
<Sol> It sounds more like Dash
<Silverscreen> 11I have to go with original Sonic 1 music.
<RobotPinkie> Best Sonic music? Mystic Cave Zone.
<Sol> Adurrhurr I feel slow
<Neponig> I can ponies more than you.
<RobotPinkie> MYSTIC FUCKING CAVE ZONE
<Ghosties> 4Actually, I was asking for best track in a Sonic game
<AllisZero> Wow this is annoying
<Ghosties> 4Any Sonic Game
<AllisZero> As shit
<Ghosties> 4*game
<Neponig> This is why I love you, RobotPinkie.
<Silverscreen> 11Green Hill Zone. It's the first thing you hear and it sticks with you.
<Ziltoid> IT IS ON
<prince-dari> Angry sex?
<desertman2> Ice Cap zone has the best music
<Dark_Heart> A ROCK!?!?!
<prince-dari> IT IS ON!
<AllisZero> ^
<Thunder_Dash> Well, almost every Sonic game has amazing music anyways, so...
<RobotPinkie> You do, Neponig? :O

<Nittany_Tiger> I like the song from the second Act of Sonic 2.

<Neponig> Yes, RobotPinkie. I do.
<RAWRity> took forever to get to that point
*RobotPinkie hugs Neponig
<Ziltoid> mystic cave zone what?
<Ghosties> 4It's obviously the Invincibility fanfare from Sonic 3
<Bufurd> looping videos make me cry
<desertman2> Nittany_Tiger: You mean Chemical Plant?
*Neponig hugs RobotPinkie back
<Zephirdd> >mfw everyone is talking about Sonic and I never played it
<Combustiblelemons> please, the yoshi's island final boss fight music was best
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Sonic sucks.
