<Guest_9001> Oh?
<ventil> this is so dope
<Nyst> There's no greater joy then to find ponies on the net (or irl) where you don't expect it.
<Nomikos> should have put on "THE SCOTTISH PLAY", and whistled on stage
<MantisToboggan> well you don't really need to get the ref
<Ghostie> *CRACK*
<PK-Gaming> Uh oh
<MantisToboggan> to know it's bad

*DSNesmith plugs ears
<Starchaser> SOLO 1

<ulsuspect> or hey
*DSNesmith with cement
<eXAKR> Oh noes
<Captain> guitar solos
<ulsuspect> dr whooves
<sotha> 5x Lyra!
<Rainbow-Fox> I love the dubstep version!
<Blue2> Riff = epic
<NightmareTrixie> i need a live stream and i need it nao
<eXAKR> bad 1980's music
<CourtyardDroll> I would say so?
<pmv_is_best_mv> scenes like this are hard to watch
<CaptainRainbow> Derpy does not approve
<shadow_light> karate
<PK-Gaming> DOCTOR WHOOVES
<Guest_9001> SUN!!
<hmc> i love this
<Sylph> I like it ^^
<SirHoovesington> the 1980's where a hell of a drug
<Thunder_Dash> I feel very, very sorry for Ingram for having to make this song worse than it was originally
<Strigoides> EUrobeat version is the best
<Flutterwhat> the dub step one is the original one in my headcannon
<RayneJCyro> I like the chorus lines
<Guest_9001> Celestia will banish them for they're paper sund
<wobblert> i
<Ghostie> Am I really the only one who loves Scootaloo's singing?
<Flutterwhat> this is just a lame remix
<PK-Gaming> dem moves
<Hat> eurobeat version is amazing
<Starchaser> IM IN THE BACK P;LAYING THE GUITAR
<ulsuspect> one day pony ill be muffinproof
<Kammerjunk> I hope they get their Cutie Marks in S2. I can't stand this.
<wobblert> was just gonna say about the eurobeat
<Nyst> Yeah, he actually had to make it even worse after his first try
<MASTERLINKX> they'll never get their cutie marks
<SirHoovesington> fog machine
<Captain> solo 2
<Starchaser> SOLO 2
<eXAKR> I like the 8-bit version
<EspyLacopa> I feel sorry for the poor singer for having to forever more hear herself singing so poorly
<Kammerjunk> I think I might as well mute the feed and put on Ballad of Autumn Dreams.
<Nomikos> Ghostie: nope, i like it too :D sounds like MY singing...
<MantisToboggan> Ghostie there's a version of this on youtube with the music removed so you only get her singing
<Blue2> Better then Lady gaga videos, eh?
<SirHoovesington> way better
<Xtralife> Blue2: zing!
<ulsuspect> at least its not rebecca black
<ventil> Hahaha
<RayneJCyro> I dunno what's worse
<RayneJCyro> the fact that scootaloo's singing blows
<Drummar> hurricane fan
<Owlowiscious> Fan creates a windstorm
<Blue2> So True
<RayneJCyro> or that she sings better than me
<Owlowiscious> wat
<Frostys_Den> oh god, rebecca black noooooo
<Starchaser> ENDING SOLO
<shadow_light> song remix on youtube makes this song kick ass
<CaptainRainbow> Fuck Scootaloo
<Rasc> ded
<Captain> crash
<Frostys_Den> crash!
<ventil> duflam
<P0n3Swag> they died the end
<sotha> The only way to rectify the situation is the release the good version of the song.
<Strigoides> Does anypony else find it funny that they say who they are, and then say that they are on a quest to find out who they are?
<Hat> what a hit!
<Nyst> Rebecca Black's cutie mark is an autotuner.
<Vissia> rebbeca black and justin bieber cant compare to the awesomness of this song
<Guest_9001> Normally i don't chat with bronies, but when i do it i chat in Bronystate.
<Rainbow-Fox> AND THEN THEY DIED. THE END.
<Starchaser> DEAD
<hmc> ROCK
<Katalyst13> I liked it.
*Owlowiscious claps

<Strigoides> Same laugh
<Soup_or_man> right, nabbed a couple hours of sleep, and now i'm ready to watch some fucking ponies! :D
<ventil> _o_
<ulsuspect> rainbow dash always dresses in style. :(
<Nomikos> what would the cutie mark of someone whose special talent is cutie mark crusading even look like?
<wobblert> the vg cats comic is my headcanon for this
<Kammerjunk> Apparently, the crackheads at Hasbro also made a good version, but stuck with the bad one.
<Rainbow_derp> I'm a huge metal fan
*Owlowiscious hugs Wrek
<Kammerjunk> NO, ULSUSPECT. NO
<Hat> No!
<MASTERLINKX> we'll never hear the good version

<Rainbow-Fox> Was anyone else hoping for a good version of this song when Ingram was going to post a new S1 song?
<CeruleanStarlight> "Mine's bigger!" "Mine's heavier!"
<CourtyardDroll> WOAH. PEACHIE PIE?
<LSRagnarok> Anyone else read the latest chapter of equestria's worst baker?
<Thunder_Dash> I'd buy a soundtrack in 10 seconds flat if they released one

<DSNesmith> Everypony is best pony, but some ponies are more best pony than others
<Yeah568> Rainbow, absolutely.
<WolfX> rainbowdash is the best pony.
<Casper> Twilight pony is best pony
<CaptainDCD> 9of course

<Hat> can't wait for AAppleloosA
<Kammerjunk> I'm kind of torn between RD and Fluttershy.
<CCCPKiller> besides silver spoon and tiara bitch mc bitch
<wobblert> rainbow dash is best pony

<Kammerjunk> @Frostys_Den, Luke Skywalker,
<Frostys_Den> I like pinky pie myself :3
<RayneJCyro> Rainbow is best pony.
<loluntilmypie> What's the EST time right now?
<SuperBrony64> That must be Camp Green Lake they are at.
<billy> once me and some of my freinds were playing a gmod rp server and we all changed our names to the mane cast
<DSNesmith> he just says she's better than RBD
<Nomikos> DSNesmith: heh. and that's when i realized that 2 ponies + 2 ponies = 5 ponies
<Nyst> Rainbow dash is for sure the greatest; but not of much use if the situation doesn't call for running fast or flying.
<DSNesmith> I'm sure NC knows rarity is best pony
<Thunder_Dash> All of them, but if I had to choose only one... TD
<PK-Gaming> dem mode
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<MASTERLINKX> it's 5:19am EST
<Blue2> 5:19Am EST

<Sumica> Figured the lack of watermarks was a dead give away Thunder_Dash
<ventil> sharingan
<Guest_9001> Twilight Uchiha
<SuperBrony64> Twilight just took over Rarity's special talent
<Kammerjunk> How could Spike see the gems?
<Kelvin> ride like the wind!
<SuperBrony64> Rarity has nothing to live for now :/
<Frostys_Den> Twilight's talent is cribbin everyone's notes
<ventil> superbrony64, haha

<Max_the_Lagomorph> Hello
<Eppaljackn> I thought the Ponies were supposed to be the most intelligent species. Shouldnt they be able to genocide the buffalo?!?!
<FallenRainbow> I don't get it
<Kammerjunk> I just muted the feed and put on Ballad of Autumn Leaves.
<RainBroDash> 10pmv_is_best_mv_ that's not swearing, that's obtuse rudeness. If you wish to file a complaint or want to know why you were kicked please PM a mod instead of flailing in the chat thanks

<DragonRage> Moral of the Story: Apple Pie is best Pie.
<FlaschenJoe11> pie's are awesome!
<Nyst> When you think about it, there's more to it. They planted the apples there because it was the only flat land around; but the land is probably that way because of the decades of stampeding from the buffaloes.
<Guest_9001> ...so they're stampeding THROUGH the orchard? ALIENS!

<Kammerjunk> Ditto, Crainy.
<mib_rlubwq> I might close chat during season 2, just to make sure there is no chance of any stream lag...is it worth it? or is sharing the experience with bronies more important?
<Spose> Why is the chat so far away from the video? :(

<Appleshy> 'merica
<Whiskra> This episode is in a class of its own really, its great because it adds a depth to Pinkie Pie's character that we never saw before, and it also opens up speculation to who Pinkie Pie might've been before she met all her friends, and as to why she is so afraid of losing them (perhaps she was regarded as nothing but an abnoxious pony in whole of Ponyville befor
<Cupcakes> dat dance
<Captain> haaha spike wasn't invited

<Yoricka> Soarin x Pie canon
<SweetKandi> Hi there. Does anyone know how to get the bronystate chat on a separate client? I tried mIRC but I couldn't figure out how to do it
<nerdlinger> Haxan is a good example of an origin for the found footage style
<Fluttershy`> 9Hey! Not too many caps!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The reason the ponies feel so out of place at The Gala is because they're all working class ponies (or anti-social, in TWilight's case), and the Gala is a high-class society gathering. Each pony's idea of how the gala would be is based on their personality as well. Applejack sees it being one big State Fair, Pinkie sees it as a huge party
<Silverscreen> 11And Dash sees it as a big performance. Only Rarity and Twilight foresaw the setting for the Gala, and in both case, their failure for a dream come true is due to other ponies rather than their misconceptions.
<mib_j7npjj> HEY
