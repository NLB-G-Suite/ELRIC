<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Third in the start has one heck of a good battle scene
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> Lol, yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They could have introduced the clone army in 1.
<Spriggals> lol smurf powerd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of farting around on Naboo.
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: I do like going there every now and then.
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> I'm in Covington
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: Ah, what are you doing up there?

<Xaiden|Okari> *episode
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> I live there, duh
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: I thought you just said your from New Orleans -_-
<Canadian_Brony> Xaiden|Okari because George Lucas decided to make the middle 3 of his movies
<Canadian_Brony> *books
<Xaiden|Okari> oh
<CriticKitten> :o Shizustream and Riff? :D
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten eeyup
<BrokenCanary> YAHOO!!!!
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> I didn't say that I only asked you that because New Orleans is well known
<LadyCanary> Shizu stream is best stream :3
<Major> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Apparently, there's air?
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> like think louisiana most think new orleans
<Canadian_Brony> how is there lightning is space?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Something pushed that droid off.
<Shizuka> 13they're in the upper atmosphere
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<JESmith71> Force lightning?
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: I thought most people think of food.
<Canadian_Brony> I get it now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Makes sense Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13and going pretty fast, so the very little air that would be up there is just enough to provide resistance and conduct splosions
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> That too
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka is best logic scientist
<killerpony7733> I always loved that droid that made the dying sound
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: mmmmm I want some gumbo now, thanks a lot. -_o
<Canadian_Brony> It's a trap!
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> Hey, I have beignet cravings now.
<Canadian_Brony> oh look, big ugly and stupid in the . . . metal?
<Shooeie> Droid CARS
<Canadian_Brony> I can't say flesh
<Canadian_Brony> cuz he doesn't have much, if any
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Droids have crap reaction times.
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: Lol Cafe Du Monne or however you spell it.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: ikr?

<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: I havent been to New Orleans in a year.
<Pudge> same here i just created one to follow others
<Thrackerzod> I dont understnad social media
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> I wouldn't know about the restaurants decreasing quality
<Shooeie> Its a trap
<Xaiden|Okari> This level was soooooooo easy in the lego video game
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo atleast they don't hack your account without telling you and say it was a "White-hat hacker"
<Canadian_Brony> ^ reason why I closed my account
<JESmith71> Easy because it was the first Episode III stage I guess
<Canadian_Brony> "I want a muffin."
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: Tourists couldnt tell. They just wanna eat some and say it was delicious because they can.
<Canadian_Brony> ROFL
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs LadyCanary
*LadyCanary is hugged.
<LadyCanary> O
<Canadian_Brony> MUFFINS!!
<Canadian_Brony> LadyCanary I would throw a muffin at you, but I left them on the moon. Sorry.
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> I think the beignets are fine, only thing is that the place is severely understaffed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nom nom Jedi Chow.
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: Well, its a big area, almost always overflowing with customers, its almost impossible to be correctly staffed.
<Canadian_Brony> ". . . and now your dead. The end."
<Thrackerzod> irs lol
<Canadian_Brony> can't remember where I heard that
<Canadian_Brony> "He's due for a sequel."
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> You're right about that, but still, the beignets still get people to keep on coming back, so how exactly is the restaurant declined?
<linsett> *declining]
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Vordox> Dat Wilhelm
<Spriggals> Wilhelm
<Canadian_Brony> was that the Wilhelm Scream? Seriously?
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: I just think the quality of the food itself has decreased.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm impressed
<FUS_RO_yay> linsett: Still good though.
<Alister> Wait , why is a ship falling in space ?
<linsett> <FUS_RO_yay> Yeah it's still good in my book as well

<CriticKitten> Pft, Shizu, you silly filly. I always stay up for your streams. :3
<killerpony7733> I'm strong willed so falling asleep during being here is impossible
<BronyInstrumental> i havent slept at all in the past 2 nights. WHY am i not tired?
<Thrackerzod> whats sleep
<Canadian_Brony> caffeine?
<Sabershy> Shizuka: After BMN, I am amazed anyone is still really alll here. Most would be tired of sitting in front of a computer screen for 6/7 hours...
<Canadian_Brony> dat half ship
<Basenji> sleeping is all ive been doing but im sick actualy if i wasn't sick probbaly never would of found this site XD

<Sabershy> NullRadix: Same here.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Phase4 :)
<NullRadix> Sabershy since movie night, I've gone out and ran 3 miles. I've been kind of dead since
<Shizuka> 13okay.. i sell the dreadnought!
<Xaiden|Okari> why does everyone hate this movie? I thought it was the best one!!!
<Canadian_Brony> the what?
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka what is that?
<Shizuka> 13you should read Darths and Droids
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Sabershy> I like this movie...'s action at the end of the 2 hour filler. :)
<CriticKitten> XD
<Shooeie> The prequels are based on fillers
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music Vocal/Remix: A Tale Of Honesty / Discord's Anthem / She Didn't Put Those In Her BAHG
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Anakin doesnt have a good reason to turn evil
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I don't need an explanation for that, even if I've never heard of it
<Phase4> 00,02i read about this movie, and what happens
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<CriticKitten> XD
<Phase4> 00,02have watched it through more than once
<Phase4> 00,02and still i have no clue whats happening
<Jmo4267> >_>
<killerpony7733> Shooeie: Third was atleast very good with it's action and battle scenes
<Canadian_Brony> dem swears
<CriticKitten> lol
<Sabershy> Phase4: That is some dedication to a movie.
<Spriggals> Atleast its a better ending than a bunch of teddy bears killing trained soldiers
<Phase4> 00,02Sabershy, not realy, by 'read about' i meen daths and droids plus some other stuff
<CriticKitten> Haha
<BronyInstrumental> a new gay chip :D
<Shooeie> Spoiler Jar Jar isnt dead this movie
<Phase4> 00,02the 'seen multiple times' is because it happened to be on tv or something
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Jar Jar should had been the Sith Lord
<CriticKitten> Jar Jar never dies.
<Canadian_Brony> WWWHHHHAAAATTTTT?!?!?!?!?
<BronyInstrumental> Spriggals: conkers bad fur day?
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118883-CLOP-is-QWOP-With-Unicorns
<Sabershy> Or for the second time on stream, :D
<CriticKitten> He's secretly alive when the Emperor dies and takes over in their absence.
<Spriggals> Yep
<CriticKitten> Phase: Linked that a few days back. 'tis awesome, no?
<BronyInstrumental> Spriggals: that's not the end of conker's bad fur day
<CriticKitten> Dat attack
<Xaiden|Okari> I never found out, what happens to JarJar at the end of this movie?
<Spriggals> It is now
<CriticKitten> Nothing.
<Spriggals> :P
<Shooeie> Nothing
<Xaiden|Okari> really
<Shizuka> 13he's allowed to live
<Shooeie> Thats the sad part
<Shizuka> 13worst part of the whole series right there
<Canadian_Brony> Jar Jar should have the death sentence. He is responsible for a war IIRC.
<Thrackerzod> what shizuke the movie/
<CriticKitten> Dat metal flank
<CriticKitten> EVERY building.
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<Canadian_Brony> dat penis joke
<Xaiden|Okari> exactly
<Petrified_Discord> mfw wherefore doesn't mean "where"
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, its a little easier than QWOP
<Canadian_Brony> I've never read Romeo and Juliet
<CriticKitten> Anchor baby joke, wow. XD
<Shooeie> Brony
<Shooeie> They both die
<Canadian_Brony> but I know I'll have to read Shakespeare in English 11
<Xaiden|Okari> yup
<CriticKitten> Phase4: God I'd hope so, QWOP is pure pain
<Xaiden|Okari> eeeeeeeeeyup
<Shooeie> Forceshadow
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, well its not easy, but quadripeds are natuallry more stable
<Phase4> 00,02POWERPUFF GIRLS
<CriticKitten> Padme x JarJar OTP. Ogodwhy
<Canadian_Brony> We never get any new books. If I'm going to read something, I dont' want it to be 50+ years old. I want to learn English, not History!
<Xaiden|Okari> why are they hating this movie sooooo much?
<Shooeie> Jar Jar is alove
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: thats what they do
<Shooeie> alive
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: they dont have any other humor
<Spriggals> lol
<Xaiden|Okari> But why???
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: because non-insult humor is a lot harder
<Shooeie> Its nothing more than fillers
<Canadian_Brony> I'm rather neutral about the Star Wars series.
<CriticKitten> xD
<Shooeie> So was I before i saw the prequels
<CriticKitten> XD
<Spriggals> lol
<Petrified_Discord> I feel like poking fun at the prequels is fine. It's when people bitch insessantly that it gets a bit much :P
<twilight_sprinkle> imo sw3 was as great as the originals
<twilight_sprinkle> minues the high ground
*CriticKitten just lol'd at that singing line
<BronyInstrumental> well guys, i'm gonna get outta here so i can pass out on a bed
<Shooeie> Puppet yoda was better than CGI
<twilight_sprinkle> bye BronyInstrumental
<Canadian_Brony> g'night BronyInstrumental
<Shooeie> G'night brony
<Spriggals> night
<Shooeie> too lazy to spell out your name
<Sabershy> Xaiden|Okari: According to canon: Jar-Jar realizes his role in the Sith takeover and actually learns to shut the hell up. The Emperor recognizes that thanks to Jar-Jar, he was easily able to take control. Therefore, Palpatine gives Jar-Jar a luxurious life until, presumably, either/both dies.
<twilight_sprinkle> one of the good things about this movie was that for once love wasnt the ultimate good, and its demonstrated how love can be just as evil as hate and such
<Canadian_Brony> brb. My flank is killing me
<CriticKitten> That was bad. XD
<Petrified_Discord> Sabershy: Doesn't he say "Wesa free" at the end of the new "Return of the Jedi"?
<Shooeie> No it was fear
<CriticKitten> ....they added him to Return?
<CriticKitten> ._.
<Shooeie> Fear caused annie to do all these bad things
<Petrified_Discord> CriticKitten: Eeyup
<CriticKitten> ....
<Azuredragon> Who's doing the commentary?
<Canadian_Brony> Azuredragon Rifftrax
<Canadian_Brony> they do movie commentaries
*CriticKitten raises his paws into the sky and gives a Spoony-esque "BETRAAAAAAAAYAL" scream.
<Petrified_Discord> CriticKitten: This means that Jar Jar gets the last line in the series. Think about that. :|
<CriticKitten> Dat ghost
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Shooeie: fear caused by love
<Spriggals> LMAO
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Mace Windu should i said that
<twilight_sprinkle> Shooeie: it was his unobjective love towards padme above anything else
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're still a n00b, Annie.
<Shooeie> If you count there is only 3 black people in all of star wars
<CriticKitten> Love how they keep giving him more typical Samuel Jackson dialogue. XD
<CriticKitten> Why?
<Canadian_Brony> it's funny
<Sabershy> Petrified_Discord: The "Return of the Jadi" was made before the prequels were made, so Jar-Jar didn't exist yet. Unless George Lucas changed something in the movies... again...
<Ponies47> Ummmm. HELLO EVERYPONY! and how long was I playing TF2? O_O
<RustyMeat> lol
<CriticKitten> I'm actually somewhat curious, why do they need the Wookies?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Ponies47. Not sure
<Phase4> 00,02i just completed qwop
<Shooeie> Peace or some shit
<Pudge> good night everypony
<Canadian_Brony> all dem swears
<Phase4> 00,02i jumped 0.3 meters
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Pudge
<Petrified_Discord> Sabershy: He's in the new "re-edited" version. There are at least three versions of RoTJ
<Shooeie> Cya Pudge
<Canadian_Brony> you JUMPED?!?
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: It was a pretty long time O_O
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Slaves? >_>
<Ponies47> Night Pudge
<Canadian_Brony> I can't walk in QWOP
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Ponies47
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: This is the Republic, not the Empire. So the slave excuse doesn't fly.
<Sabershy> Bye Pudge. :)
<Ponies47> Hey twilight_sprinkle
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> bye Pudge
<CriticKitten> Treason is fine during war. *nod*
<Canadian_Brony> dat cat

<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<Shooeie> How did annie get that scar?
<twilight_sprinkle> oh my, character and story development, the horror
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, i didnt wa;lk
<twilight_sprinkle> quick, lets insult it
<Phase4> 00,02i inched along using qw and his right knee
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 I can't even get to that without f*cking it up
<Xaiden|Okari> Keeps callin me shaft, LOL
<Canadian_Brony> ROFL
<CriticKitten> Where did this prophecy come from, incidentally?
<Petrified_Discord> The reason this feels so dull is because this scene, like many others, is done in shot-reverse-shot. Bluescreen is a double-edged sword :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Im off too. Night y;all!
<CriticKitten> LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> gnight Scoot-Scootaloo
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> night Scoot-Scootaloo
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Scoot-Scootaloo
<CriticKitten> That last line was the best one. XD
<CriticKitten> "Off, it pisses me."
<Canadian_Brony> I think I missed it
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<superretroworld> Bronysith: its your favourite movie
<Petrified_Discord> CriticKitten: My favorite is still "penis-headed ghost of Hamlet's father" XD
<Spriggals> I'm losing it, this is funniest one I have seen from these guys XD
*Bronysith cocks a revolver next to superretroworld s head
<Bronysith> superretroworld: you want to reword that?
<Shizuka> 13best line here
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Bronysith
<CriticKitten> What? XD
<Canadian_Brony> which one?
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Some research shows that Wookies were pretty just much like humans: beaing capable of flight, trade, and has the ability to be able to use the force.
<Canadian_Brony> which is best line?
<Shizuka> 13coming
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> wth are they watching
<Canadian_Brony> *poker face*
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: Along with dozens of other alien races.
<superretroworld> Bronysith: i thought you liked star wars?
<Sabershy> They had no real "purpose".
<Bronysith> superretroworld: this isnt star wars
<Canadian_Brony> not sure if that was the line . . .
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: Why do they specifically need the Wookies?
<Shizuka> 13here
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Shizuka> 13best fourth.. fifth wall breaking riff ever
<Reikim|AWAY> Night everyone. Time to sleep...
<Xaiden|Okari> does the paintchat on this site work?

<Bronysith> night Reikim|AWAY
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: it did work a few hours
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I don't get it
<superretroworld> Bronysith: oh its rifftrax, nevermind
<Canadian_Brony> go ahead, facehoof
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: should still work
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: "so they're just going to sit alone in those theater seats and make wisecracks about the show? what jerks!"
<Xaiden|Okari> twilight_sprinkle: Well it's just Java's not loading
<Bronysith> superretroworld: episode 1-3 is not star wars
<CriticKitten> HA
<Shizuka> 13as in
<Shizuka> 13what mst3k does
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Who knows? After the Sith took over, the Wookies continually fought against Palpatine, finally angering him into making the whole race as "slaves"
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka oh
<Xaiden|Okari> twilight_sprinkle: but that might just be because I have a bad computer
<superretroworld> Bronysith: ik, i thought since you were a big fan of star wars you liked all of them
<cratorkid> im a libertarian
<JESmith71> He's a fan of the originals
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: i just checked, it worked
<Bronysith> superretroworld: um...a big fan of star wars hates the prequels...
<Canadian_Brony> I'm sorry, but I'm not laughing. I should lay off the caffeine . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: didnt work on a dif pc for me btw
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: It's just one of those little things that kinda gives me a bit of a twitch. The only reason I can come up with? So that Lucas could shoehorn Chewbacca into the film.
<Xaiden|Okari> twilight_sprinkle: I guess it doesn't work on G-Chroome
<Ponies47> Moo
<superretroworld> Bronysith: yeah good point
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: im using chrome
<Canadian_Brony> Chroome?
<Jmo4267> CHROOOOOME
<Xaiden|Okari> my bad
<Canadian_Brony> Lolz
<Petrified_Discord> Chroooome is best internet browser
<Jmo4267> Amen.
<Canadian_Brony> better than IE
<HellsFortune> hello ppl
<Canadian_Brony> hi HellsFortune
<Xaiden|Okari> Agree'd,
<Petrified_Discord> Pfft. OPERA is better than IE XD
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Oh, you mean won of the many plotholes that Lucas has a tendency to shove down our throats and up our asses? In that case, yea, you are totally right. :)
*CriticKitten is curious if this is canon or if this is just supposed to be Palpatine being a lying shit.
<Jmo4267> You read my mind Petrified_Discord.
<HellsFortune> hmm... what am i watching ? ;o
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if the new IE is as good as they advertise :P
<Canadian_Brony> the only use I see in IE is downloading a new browser
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<CriticKitten> Dryer lint? XD
<Canadian_Brony> HellsFortune Star Wars III with Rifftrax
<HellsFortune> hm.. ok :)
<CriticKitten> Er, that's not actually ironic
<CriticKitten> Suddenly Avatar.
<Petrified_Discord> Palpatine on Tape
<Xaiden|Okari> the soundtrack for this movie was amazing in my opinion
*Sabershy slaps twilight_sparkle
<Sabershy> Nope. :)
<[Alpha]> Commentary seems to make this bearable
<Sabershy> Just listen to Alex Clare, the music to their new ads, and smile.
<JESmith71> Alpha, that's their job, making terrible movies fun to watch
<Canadian_Brony> Survivor is stupid. Some people quit their jobs to stay on the show. Imagine how that would look on your resume.

<Xaiden|Okari> twilight_sprinkle: I did, I just was like 5\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sabershy: I guess. It's been a long day.
<CriticKitten> Dat face
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: I loved that level, so fun as a sniper :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And hi Ponies47!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Xaiden|Okari: well i would suggest you rewatch it, its a good opportunity to experience
<JESmith71> [Alpha] it was a TV show that these guys doing the commentary used to do. Look it up on YouTube.
<twilight_sprinkle> why not electrostatic force, or gravitation force
<Canadian_Brony> I would grab a Flachette Shotgun on Engineer and hop in a tank. Mowin' em down!
<Sabershy> Nittany_Discord: Sorry to hear that. Anything I can do to help?
<[Alpha]> Okay I shall do that later
<CriticKitten> OF THE FUTURE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sabershy: I'll be fine. Thanks for the offer.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's not much you can do.
<Ponies47> Oh incase any of you don't know already. I have made a new Skype "Ponies47" is my username. Feal free to add me. But I can't do any calls yet. I still don't have a mic and webcam. Atleast not yet :P
<Canadian_Brony> Moulin Rouge . . . where have I heard that before . . .
<Azuredragon> NC
<Spriggals> VS
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord I would throw a muffin at you if I didn't leave them all on the moon.
<Xaiden|Okari> Lol?
<Petrified_Discord> Anakin's mad because he doesn't have his cutie mark yet. :D
<CriticKitten> The script tells me I should have more....
<Sabershy> Nittany_Discord: Alright then... :(
<JESmith71> [Alpha] also look up Rifftrax. It's what the guys did after the TV show ended, where they make fun of recent films. On MST3K (short for Mystery Science Theater 3000) they could only make fun of old obscure movies due to costs
<Ponies47> Petrified_Discord: :D
<Xaiden|Okari> Petrified_Discord: THATS THE SOLUTION!! GET THAT MAN THE CMC!!!!!!!!!
<superretroworld> u mad vader?
<Petrified_Discord> Xaiden|Okari: Cutie Mark Crusader Sith Lords! YAY! :D
<pony_1865> awwwwwww yeah
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Sabershy. The only help I need is financial, and I need that a lot, but I can't use people for money.
*Sabershy accepts the hug.
<pony_1865> lmao
<Sabershy> Haha, we are in the same boat then. Just got pay. 600 goes to rent, so that leaves me with 100 left. Which I just spent on food and gas...
<Waffles> wtf someones talking
<pony_1865> dats me
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, uts not like that spaceship rising had any meaning or anyting
<Canadian_Brony> hi Waffles. That's the guys on Rifftrax doing a commentary
<Shizuka> 13goofy wan balogna is best jedi
<Petrified_Discord> The Mooooooostifar system
<pony_1865> gooby plz
<IIFierceDeityII> hi everypony
<RaveBrony> Lol!!!
<Canadian_Brony> hi IIFierceDeityII

<IIFierceDeityII> streaking
<Canadian_Brony> "volcanic planet" five times fast :P
<Xaiden|Okari> Shizuka: Agreed
<Waffles> woo!
<Xaiden|Okari> POW
<Xaiden|Okari> hELLO THERE
<IIFierceDeityII> keeel hem
<Waffles> hey Xaiden|Okari
<pony_1865> hello
<Canadian_Brony> Sheep. I'm thinking of Endhiran.
<Xaiden|Okari> Ughh, no I"M QUOTING THE MOVIE! XD
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Petrified_Discord> They failed the QTE
<CriticKitten> Uh, why?
<Vordox> Man Rifftrax is having ALOT Of fun in this one :D
<IIFierceDeityII> id rather dance :D
<Canadian_Brony> use "Quotes" for quotes
<CriticKitten> You have hundreds of droids there, he can't possibly outgun them all.
<CriticKitten> Just let them attack you idiot.
<Xaiden|Okari> Spiny hands, me jelly
<RaveBrony> Dance!
<pony_5717> dance!
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten IKR?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: what do you think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<IIFierceDeityII> Xaiden|Okari: me too
<pony_5717> 6_9
<Xaiden|Okari> ONE HAND GONE
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<Canadian_Brony> wuwuwuwwuwuwub
<Xaiden|Okari> TWO HANDS GONE
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its because he has the opportunity to kill himself, and even if he fails, they kill him.
<Canadian_Brony> sound of a lightsaber spinning
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<Xaiden|Okari> Clone troopers
<Xaiden|Okari> dafuq
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its called arrogance and revenge.
<Quick_Thinker> this is like mystry sciene theater 3000 :D
<pony_1865> The general is pretty lame in the movie :(
<RaveBrony> Yeah...
<Canadian_Brony> it's Rifftrax
<Xaiden|Okari> Spider
<Canadian_Brony> but essentially, yeah
<Xaiden|Okari> seems legit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<IIFierceDeityII> i think in the time it too for him to board and activate that thing, he could have killed him
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I think Ep2 established that a large enough swarm of droids can kill even a squad of Jedi. This is ONE Jedi. He has a chance to kill one of the lead generals without much effort or loss, then he could spend his time hacking through the entire incoming fleet himself.
<CriticKitten> So for a "general", Grevious is showing that he's kind of an idiot.
<Xaiden|Okari> Dafuq
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Canadian_Brony> Grevious IS an idiot
<RaveBrony> Dat lipgloss
<Xaiden|Okari> random lightsaber
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i just explained it... and sith generals dont participate in battles they dont have to
<Vordox> Third life
<Vordox> hur hur
<pony_1865> Yep who thinks grevious is an idiot say I
<Canadian_Brony> I
<IIFierceDeityII> twilight_sprinkle: just like generals IRL
<Xaiden|Okari> I
<Petrified_Discord> "Aye"
<Petrified_Discord> :|
<Canadian_Brony> plot
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Obi-Wan is very special. You can't kill her. IT WILL CREATE A TIME PARADOX!
<Sabershy> *him
<Bronysith> pony_1865: I
<IIFierceDeityII> lmao her
<Canadian_Brony> I'm trying so hard not to make a wisecrack
<Xaiden|Okari> Grevious is my favorite jedi, though he IS an idiot
<Jmo4267> lol her.
<IIFierceDeityII> heyo Jmo4267
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
*Nittany_Discord 11,01engages
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And I just said that was a bad excuse. He's the leader of the Separatist army right now. He can't afford to risk losing a fight to Obi-Wan, and doesn't need to when all those droids could have killed him straight up. :P
<Azuredragon> Grevious isn't a jedi......
<Canadian_Brony> I just got that joke Nittany_Discord
<Petrified_Discord> Palpatine is my favorite Jedi
<Canadian_Brony> almost did a spittake
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Canadian_Brony> STFU
<IIFierceDeityII> they took down my facebook page XD
<Canadian_Brony> ROFL
<CriticKitten> XD
<Spriggals> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: [07:35:18] <twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its called arrogance and revenge.
<sub06905> nude steam bath
<RaveBrony> Oh god
<IIFierceDeityII> lol i love these things XS
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And he gets his revenge by letting the droids gun him down. >_>
<IIFierceDeityII> *XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: thats not as satisfying...
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY, as always, may the force be with you all and be sure to pierce the heavens with your drill!
<Canadian_Brony> nude steam bath is best . . . buck it, I'm not sayin' it
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: seeing as how he thought he could do that even if he loses
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Who cares? He's the last leader left in an army that is losing the war!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Bronysith
<IIFierceDeityII> night Bronysith !
<Xaiden|Okari> Palpatines the sith lord? DIDNT SEE THAT COMING? :P
<sub06905> night Bronysith
<Petrified_Discord> Uncle Evil
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<Canadian_Brony> kill him!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: He's basically just said "well the war isn't as important as me killing one single Jedi", making him officially the worst general ever.
<RaveBrony> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: name me a single villain who immediately killed the main hero
<Xaiden|Okari> Petrified_Discord: LOL
<Canadian_Brony> kill him now!
<RaveBrony> A porn of the jedi? :D
<ancientblood> whos commenting
<Canadian_Brony> hi ancientblood. Rifftrax
<Canadian_Brony> DO IT!!
<IIFierceDeityII> :D
<RaveBrony> ;)
<Canadian_Brony> KILL HIM!!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Wat? He's trying to kill him right now!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: .......
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: He just chose the STUPID way to do it.
<Jmo4267> Herro
<Jmo4267> Night Bronysith
<Spriggals> wow lol
<Xaiden|Okari> someone's probably wrote a FiC about Palpatine and Annie doin it
<Xaiden|Okari> just sayin
<Xaiden|Okari> :P
<Buytoast> i can probably find it
<CriticKitten> Didn't need to imagine that.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: name a single villain who didnt toy with the protagonist instead of just shooting him
<Xaiden|Okari> Buytoast: PLEASE DONT
<Waffles> i heard disturbing noises
<RaveBrony> Wawawawawa
<Petrified_Discord> All hail the lizard king!
<IIFierceDeityII> i heard dubstep XD
<Canadian_Brony> Wuwuwuwuwuwuwuuwuwub
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Oh so *now* it's okay for the movie to resort to a cliche that you'd bitch about in any other movie. :P
<ancientblood> is it just me or is the movie laggier then hell
<Sabershy> twilight_sprinkle: Darth Maul?
<Petrified_Discord> ancientblood: Just you
<IIFierceDeityII> ancientblood: try refreshing, its fine on my end
<twilight_sprinkle> Sabershy: quigon had no purpose
<Buytoast> yeah, yeah i found one
<Buytoast> thanks google
<Xaiden|Okari> KICK
<Xaiden|Okari> Y U NO USE FORCE?
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it was smart for you to take the Jedi on singlehandedly, wasn't it, Grievous?
<IIFierceDeityII> Xaiden|Okari: IRK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Petrified_Discord> GREVIOUS SMASH! :[
<IIFierceDeityII> *IKR
<RaveBrony> LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: lol, and now apparently this is bad for you, even tho bane in your precious batman movie couldve killed batman immediately as well
<CriticKitten> No need to use that ARMY OF DROIDS YOU HAD SURROUNDING HIM, just do it yourself
<Xaiden|Okari> Sure kick the robot, smart
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten eeyup
<Sabershy> Twilight_sprinkle: You just said Liam Neeson has no purpoe...
<IIFierceDeityII> lmao
<sub06905> ded
<RaveBrony> Killed...by, a gun
<Xaiden|Okari> ignore the FORCE POWERS YOU'VE SPENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE LEARNING
<Azuredragon> That was easy, now how did he live through a whole goddamn cartoon series?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yes, and he should have.
<Petrified_Discord> Obi-wan, y u no make heartburn joke?
<IIFierceDeityII> Xaiden|Okari: hahaha XD
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<Canadian_Brony> dat funny death arrangement
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its in every movie, and the reason for it is villain arrogance
<[Alpha]> I thought Jedis didn't use guns?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But sorry, TDKR is still a better film, so your troll analogy fails. :P
<Xaiden|Okari> I need to do stand up comedy... :P
<Canadian_Brony> [Alpha] they don't
<Canadian_Brony> that wasn't a gun *AJ pokerface*
<MASF123> What the fack? Star Wars?
<ancientblood> theres two people commentating its riffrax and....
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: if you love generic 21st centry action movies.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And my reply to that is "he's a shitty general then".
<Canadian_Brony> "We must move quickly. Walk slowly beside me."
<pony_1865> MACE WINDU IS TEH BEST!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: the only movie without that that i can think of where the villain didnt screw around is scot pilgrimm
<Canadian_Brony> "Now stop."
<IIFierceDeityII> master bug eyed rasta fish XD
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You seem confused. I don't care about the cliche. I'm pointing out that resorting to the cliche at this point in the movie makes him a bad general by default. :p
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<Xaiden|Okari> Wow, a squad of jedi CONVIENTLY IN A SHIP TO GO TO THE CHANCELLORS PALACE!!! HOW CONVIENENT!!
<lowfn> back
<lowfn> What are we atching
<IIFierceDeityII> lmao
<Petrified_Discord> Aaand Padme wins the gold in competetive sitting :D
<pony_1865> :O
<Spriggals> lol
<IIFierceDeityII> Petrified_Discord: hahahahaha
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> this was so unneeded
<Ponies47> Moo :3
<CriticKitten> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: which means that prety much every villain in history is also a bad villain
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<IIFierceDeityII> I love combos <3
<Xaiden|Okari> COOOOOOOOOMBBOOOOOOOOOO!!!
*Canadian_Brony likes combos
<Shizuka> 13i think i miss the combos reference
<Xaiden|Okari> AN ORGY OF DICK TOWERS
<Quick_Thinker> lego :)
<Shizuka> 13obviously a snack
<Xaiden|Okari> LEGO STAR WARS FAWK YES
<Petrified_Discord> Legos > Star Wars
<IIFierceDeityII> Xaiden|Okari: haha
<Canadian_Brony> I like lego
*Nittany_Discord 11,01combos Shizuka
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Not every villain. But I'm glad you're finally admitting that this is a mediocre film by pointing out that it, like all other average films, resorts to tired action cliches.
<Azuredragon> Lego starwars was a fun game
<Spriggals> LOL
<Canadian_Brony> ROFL
<ancientblood> why is he censored
<sub06905> i am the senate
<Xaiden|Okari> This scene, I'm not going to lie, gave me fawking nightmares. That's what I get for watching this when I was 6
<IIFierceDeityII> hahahaha XD
<CriticKitten> I think they handled this scene poorly.
<Shizuka> 13so... those three jedis...
<Azuredragon> And all the Jedi get there asses handed to them
<Shizuka> 13they were useful..
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: lol dont start twisting my words, i never said its a bad movie. to the contrary, that one cliche changes nothing since pretty much every movie does it
<Shizuka> 13and you know what
<JESmith71> Lego Star Wars, the fun way to do the prequels and Clone Wars
<IIFierceDeityII> Shizuka: indeed
<ponibas> those jedi were scrubs
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> dem jedi suck
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka they were?
<Shizuka> 13i'm sure somewhere they have like their entire family tree mapped and extensive novels about their history
<Petrified_Discord> "Let me hold my lightsaber over my head so you can stab me in the chest!" :D
<Xaiden|Okari> WHERES THE USE OF THE FAWKING FORCE
<Xaiden|Okari> DAT STARE
<Canadian_Brony> I want popcorn
<ponibas> lol, probably
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You're arguing in favor of the cliche by saying "It's in every other movie". Which actually helps reinforce my argument that this is an average movie.
<Canadian_Brony> Anikrap
<Spriggals> crap*
<CriticKitten> So yes, you ARE agreeing with me. :P
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<Quick_Thinker> explaining how to make food is more exciting then this movie XD
<Shizuka> 13i love this bit so much
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: lol then so is your precious batman movie
<Sabershy> Shizuka: Do you want me to give you the specific web links to their history? :)
<Xaiden|Okari> Shizuka: Same, fawking awesome
<Xaiden|Okari> DAT KICK
<killerpony7733> Lore wise it makes sense that mace windu can counter darth sidious since mace has learned most known fighting styles
<Ponies47> brb
<Shizuka> 13their bit in matrix reloaded about having bacon in the booth is almost as good
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You realize I've stopped paying attention to your trolling already right? If you can't produce a good argument then don't start one. ;D
<IIFierceDeityII> XD
<Canadian_Brony> why did the glass shatter? The lightsaber should have cut a hole in it
<Canadian_Brony> CUT
<Xaiden|Okari> NO NOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Canadian_Brony> not SHATTER
<IIFierceDeityII> lmao
<Shizuka> 13pressurized i assume
<Azuredragon> Anicra : hey guys hows it going
<Xaiden|Okari> dat no
<IIFierceDeityII> hes not properly grounded XD
<Shizuka> 13more pressure inside than out
<Shizuka> 13for some reason
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<CriticKitten> And like I said when this aired the other day, this would've been a much more effective battle sequence if Palpatine was fighting all four of the Jedi at the same time.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Anakin is racist
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: that contains no information. you say this movie is medioacre because it uses a cliche every other movie does, but if your batman movie does it, its ok
<Ponies47> back
<Petrified_Discord> By the power of greyskull, I HAVE THE POWAAAAAAAAA
<Xaiden|Okari> Darth Syphillis!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: double standards.
<CriticKitten> Instead of just killing three of them in seconds.
<IIFierceDeityII> lmao darth syphillis XD
<Shizuka> 13POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka you can hear wind, and the building looks pretty damn high up . . . why am I defending Star Wars?

<IIFierceDeityII> Xaiden|Okari: you are making me laugh so much, thanks XD
<Quick_Thinker> ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I repeat: if you can't make a good argument, don't start one. Right now your primary argument is "it uses a common cliche therefore it's fine" followed by meaningless attempts to mock Batman despite it being a way better movie. Now, decide if you're going to say something of value or shush. :P
<Sabershy> I just realized the chat is like 10~15 secs ahead of my stream. Hmm.
<Xaiden|Okari> IIFierceDeityII: Comedy, its what I'm good at
<CriticKitten> LOL

<Xaiden|Okari> :P
<Canadian_Brony> *Samuel Jackson joke*
<Shizuka> 13i think i just understood his grunting there...
<Xaiden|Okari> Canadian_Brony: LOL
<Shizuka> 13"to cheat death is a power obi wan has learned"
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka can you explain it?
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Totally. Didn't you see how the lightning in Return of the Jedi severaly aged Luke?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How quick Annie is to turn evil.
<IIFierceDeityII> bahahaha XD
<sub06905> forehead ass
<Shizuka> 13so.. the whole jedi ghost thing is mentioned before yoda drops it at the end
<Xaiden|Okari> Nittany_Discord: IKR
<Shizuka> 13problem is he's grunting so hard you can barely understand it
<Quick_Thinker> no did not notice him aging when he got shocked
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: all youre doing is avoiding the subject of your double standards, meaning you pretty much lose.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Petrified_Discord> What's this? ANIKARP evolved into GYARADARTH VADER!!! :D
<IIFierceDeityII> Darth Timberlake XD
<Xaiden|Okari> Dude Darth Syphillis looks like a fawking balsac......
<Xaiden|Okari> just sayin
<Quick_Thinker> darth timberlake sounds better
<Spriggals> LOL
<Azuredragon> Darth Timberlake is best Sith
<AJIsAwesome> Bye guys, I'm out! See you tomorrow!
<IIFierceDeityII> XD BAWLSAK
<Quick_Thinker> and it sounds more fitting
<Xaiden|Okari> AJIsAwesome: CYA
<IIFierceDeityII> later AJIsAwesome
<Buytoast> Darth Scrotumface has spoken
<Sabershy> CriticKitten & twilight_sprinkle: Stop talking. Or at least stop making comments toward each other. Its enough.
<Xaiden|Okari> BAWLS
<JESmith71> Darth Pruneface
<Xaiden|Okari> *Diarehha joke* LAWL
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, the subject is this movie being average at best. You keep trying to make it about Batman because you've got nothing to defend the film besides ad hominem against me. I'll ask it once more: do you have an actual argument or not?
<IIFierceDeityII> XD
<Xaiden|Okari> Did they like change actors for darth sidious?
<Canadian_Brony> Darth *stupid name* is best sith
<Xaiden|Okari> cuz they both suck
<Xaiden|Okari> :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Xaiden|Okari: nah they used face artists
<CriticKitten> Three more sequels! :o
<JESmith71> It's the same guy from Return of the Jedi
<Shizuka> 13so much bad acting
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: for the 10th fucking time, yes i have an argument, why are you saying that if this movies uses a generic cliche the movie is generic, but of batman uses the same cliche it doesnt mean anything?
<Xaiden|Okari> DAMNIT NOT THREE MORE
<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<CriticKitten> xD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> XD
<CriticKitten> God his voice really is so bland.
<IIFierceDeityII> brb, snack run
<Canadian_Brony> *bad acting joke*
<Shizuka> 13darth actor
<Xaiden|Okari> IIFierceDeityII: GET DA MUNCHIES FOR ME
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka seems legit
<Buytoast> it's like the penguin has throat cancer
<Jmo4267> Muffins.
<Xaiden|Okari> that was... BEAUTIFUL
<Canadian_Brony> MUFFINS!!
<CriticKitten> I do enjoy Palpatine's acting though. It's so hammy it's awesome.
<Xaiden|Okari> MUFFFIINNSS!!!!!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> you'd think Jedi could take on this army
<Quick_Thinker> lets see how many jedi acidemys there are: corasant, Yavin, Korriban, Kasak, Balti, Bespin, and Hoth OVERALL A SHIT TON
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> >.>
<Shizuka> 13during all of that
<Shizuka> 13the battle is still raging just as hard
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I didn't. I never did. I simply pointed out that General Grevious is a bad general.
<Azuredragon> 1 hour left
<Xaiden|Okari> Something of mine is raging quite hard.... :3
<Shizuka> 13it's the same timescale problem as empire... tons of time passes in one place, five minutes passes in another
<GabeMoist> Tell him to move to the high ground
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka seems legit
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: if hes a bad general, then its not because of that cliche.
<JESmith71> CritcKitten shame that Grevous is bad here, considering how much ass he kicked in the 2D Clone War cartoon before he got crippled by Windu
<Xaiden|Okari> What are the other 65 orders?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, he's just a bad general because of pretty much everything he does in this movie, really.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Canadian_Brony> Xaiden|Okari nopony knows . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: like
<CriticKitten> JESmith71: Inorite. ;_;
<pony_1865> what is a penis?
<Azuredragon> apparently clones are just better shots
<Xaiden|Okari> This was the saddest part in da movie for me... ;_;
*IIFierceDeityII hands Xaiden|Okari a bowl of popcorn

<IIFierceDeityII> hahahha XD
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker IKR?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> That Jedi was a awesome looking one
<CriticKitten> Oh no, that guy!
<Canadian_Brony> Not that guy!
<Quick_Thinker> EVEN THOUGH THE JEDI CANSEE INTO THE FUTURE YOU MORON WRITERS
<Azuredragon> Yoda ain't no fool
<Xaiden|Okari> Ded
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Supposedly the two total Sith were blocking the abilities and foresight of the thousands of Jedi in the universe.
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: No, I don't know how.
<Canadian_Brony> decapatation
<Quick_Thinker> WAHY

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Isnt it funny how a kid took out more soldiers?
<Sabershy> Alright everypony! Remember! Lucas like plotholes!
<Quick_Thinker> who is that random jedi?
<CriticKitten> OW
<Petrified_Discord> And here we learn why they call them "younglings." Because this way you can say "killed younglings" and not "killed children" in a movie for children. That, you know, has boring politics and implied rape, but still... :|
<[Alpha]> the family guy version made more sense
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Transformers Syndrome.
<Xaiden|Okari> [Alpha]: Oh definetly
<GabeMoist> Proto Chicken Walkers
<Quick_Thinker> oh hi thing that is just fna service
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Bromance
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Numerous good guys are shown being cut down for the sake of lazily raising the stakes, even though none of them had dialogue or even names prior to their deaths.
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Named "Transformers Syndrome" because of its common use in Bayformers.
<Quick_Thinker> hell if i remember hte books had at least 1000 jedi surive the attack
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Toilet pod away!
<Xaiden|Okari> I like how that little pod makes it past the atmosphere w/o any effort while the bigass gunships use like HALF their fuel for lift-off

<IIFierceDeityII> XD toilet pod
<Xaiden|Okari> lol
<Xaiden|Okari> ikr
<CriticKitten> >no need to bother checking if one of the most important Jedi is still alive or not
<Petrified_Discord> When will people learn? You ALWAYS survive falls that no one could survive!
<Quick_Thinker> no one could have surived that fall except a a jedi you morons
<Marx> Oh hey, it's the Rifftrax.
<CriticKitten> He's a Jedi. If you don't have a body, you go FIND ONE.

<Allegr0> Nittany_Discord: lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Took him 3 movies to die.
<CriticKitten> ....you know I noticed something else rather odd.
<Roostythefatcock> hello!
<Quick_Thinker> so NOT ONE PERSON IS ARGUING AGAINST THOSE IDEAS NOT ONE NOT A SINGLE ALIEN FROM ANY PLANET NOT EVEN EARTH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hated those characters.
<IIFierceDeityII> hello Roostythefatcock
<Petrified_Discord> Nittany_Discord: But they were so developed and logical!
<Quick_Thinker> Earth is in the universe i just got destroyed
<Roostythefatcock> hey oh man I love this movie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gunray should have died in Episode 1.
<CriticKitten> A lot of these lightsaber deaths in this film? You don't see limbs go flying off or people cut in half.
<cratorkid> Quick_Thinker: no earth , galaxy far far away and a long time ago
<cratorkid> and all
<Roostythefatcock> so whats up?
<Xaiden|Okari> Nittany_Discord: everyone should have died in Episode 1...
<IIFierceDeityII> were just watching the stream
<Quick_Thinker> what not a single jedi knight can kill anakin seriously they have in all 300 jedi knights at least
<cratorkid> im almost finished with my octavia drawing
<Canadian_Brony> i have lost control of my left arm
<Canadian_Brony> ow!
<Roostythefatcock> octavia? never heard of him
<CriticKitten> You see them get slashed a bit and that's it. That's....kind of odd for a sword that cuts through everything. Is everyone just barely scraping their enemies across the chest to kill them instead of trying to slash through them?
<Quick_Thinker> in corasant they have 300 jedi knights
<cratorkid> Canadian_Brony: what where you doing when you lost feeling?
<Petrified_Discord> ...So why didn't they team up on the Emperor first and THEN kill Anakin? Why?! :[
<Roostythefatcock> cause der noobz
<Xaiden|Okari> Canadian_Brony: Were you masturbating?
<Roostythefatcock> yes
<Xaiden|Okari> :D
<Canadian_Brony> cratorkid I hit my funny bone. STFU Xaiden|Okari
<CriticKitten> Discord: Or kill Anakin first, then the Emperor.
<CriticKitten> Either or.
<Quick_Thinker> becuase the writers got drunk and wrote shit during that
<Xaiden|Okari> Canadian_Brony: JUST JOKING
<Canadian_Brony> STFU anyway
<IIFierceDeityII> Canadian_Brony: that hurts
<Shizuka> 13Petrified_Discord: it's that idiot ball everyone is clutching like crazy
<Xaiden|Okari> Awwww
<CriticKitten> But splitting up was pretty stupid, yes. Everyone knows you never split the party.

<Canadian_Brony> it'll be fine
<Quick_Thinker> a lie oh come on not even the jedi who finished lukes training (he was a suriver of the corsant betrayl
<Quick_Thinker> true story
<Sabershy> CriticKittin: A lightsaber is just a concetrated light source and can burn through a lot of things, but not quickly. Its much easier to slash an enemy instead of getting slowed down by cutting a person in 2.
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: guess whoever came first , or he noticed how many youve been getting
<Xaiden|Okari> BEST MUSIC IN DA FAWKING WORLD
<Xaiden|Okari> INCEPTION GOT NOTHIN ON THIS BITCH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cratorkid: I don't mind.
<Canadian_Brony> you jelly?
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: And I'd be okay with that except that if you think about it? It tends to slash THROUGH the enemy in the original trilogy.
<cratorkid> Xaiden|Okari: nope lotr has a better soundtrack
<Quick_Thinker> heck in the series he encounter anakin killing the younglings and attempts to fight him only to be thrown out a window and lose his leg
<Canadian_Brony> crap, didn't mean to type taht!
<Roostythefatcock> Who has seen The Dark Knight Rises?
<cratorkid> not me
<Canadian_Brony> Roostythefatcock planning on it
<Xaiden|Okari> cratorkid: TAKE THAT BACK :[
<Sabershy> CriticKitten: Plus, they are working with wodden swords in a blue screen effect. Kinda hard to cut people in half with them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm all for giving others a chance to get their questions answered.
<Petrified_Discord> Oh Anakin, you'ree so deep and complex.
<Quick_Thinker> stubed toe :'(
<Xaiden|Okari> Lol, stubbing a toe SUCKS ASS
<cratorkid> Xaiden|Okari: never , one of the best soundracks ever

<cratorkid> Xaiden|Okari: i brush my teeth to that sh*t
<Xaiden|Okari> NO
<CriticKitten> Sabershy: The scene in the cantina? Arm comes off. Empire? Hand comes off. Return? Hand comes off.
<Petrified_Discord> Xaiden|Okari: That and stepping on legos. Yeesh.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Egophiliac has stated that she does get multiple repetitive commands but chooses one at random if she uses a repeated command.

<Sabershy> Xaiden|Okari: take that back... :'(
<Xaiden|Okari> Sabershy: Take what back?
<CriticKitten> It's not even a flaw in the film, I just find it weird that limbs don't go flying rather often with a weapon like that,

<IIFierceDeityII> lol
<Derpies> :P:P:P derpy is back!

<Ponies47> Shizuka: You be streaming?
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: hes like 120 then
<CriticKitten> See?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then he quits.
<CriticKitten> They were both pairing up well against each other, and Yoda just goes "welp time to go"
<Sabershy> Nittany_Discord: He found Bronystate and it's stream and decided to sit in his chair watching for 20 something years. :)
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: What i hate is it's never explained who was the most powerful force user in the lore.
<CriticKitten> THE FUCK YODA.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Again, such rushed pacing in Ep 3.
<Derpies> :D little robot!
<twilight_sprinkle> he quit because he couldnt win...
<CriticKitten> Did you get bored? The original trilogy was your fault, you could have ended it here damnit!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sabershy: I like that.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Canadian_Brony> hmm . . .
<Derpies> 6_9
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Galan marik or whatever his name was. He is known as one of the very very powerful jedi being able to bring down a star destroyer
<Ponies47> XD
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13anyone else want to treat this channel like their own personal 4chan?
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: I want to think of it that way.... ;_; But it bothers me that they were clearly matching up equally and then Yoda just sorta....quits.
<Derpies> i want a huf!
<Shizuka> 13no? good
<Derpies> hug
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Nope
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I've never gone to 4chan

<Quick_Thinker> why did he leave his lightsaber?
<GabeMoist> My Little 4chan My Little 4chan Ahhhahhhahhhah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka is angry. Post ponies! (don't).
<twilight_sprinkle> 4chan /mlp/ is wonderful
<Ponies47> Ok Nittany_Discord
<JESmith71> How did he fail exactly?
<Quick_Thinker> MY LITTLE 4CHAN WHAT HAPPENS IF PINKIE WAKES UP NEXT TO YOU THEY ALL SAY?
<Quick_Thinker> RaPE
<Buytoast> hell, i'm still banned from 4chan
<CriticKitten> Quick_Thinker: Well he obviously would never need that again. What are the chances of the Emperor knowing he's still alive and hunting him down....OH WAIT
<Sabershy> Shizuka: Did I miss a kick? :<
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord not even my Gala Rainbow Dash wallpaper? Aww . . . okay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01JESmith71: Failed to stop the crap pacing of this movie.
<Derpies> i want hug!
<Shizuka> 13Quick_Thinker: Rape is never funny. Do not make a joke like that again.
<Allegr0> who can't breate under fire?
<Quick_Thinker> sorry
<ponibas> Sabershy, 'twas a kick/ban
<cratorkid> Allegr0: i can ofcourse
<CriticKitten> Exactly!
<Allegr0> cratorkid: I'd expect as much
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 is that a trick question?
<Xaiden|Okari> Anicrap just happen to jumps far enough to land on a MICROSCOPIC ROBOT!!! Seems legit
<Allegr0> Canadian_Brony: idk, is it?
<CriticKitten> This is why it looks good.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Gala Rainbow Dash wallpaper? LINK ME IN PM!
<Quick_Thinker> how is that thing flying?
<Ponies47> Pwease :3
<CriticKitten> Because it's very video-gamey.
<cratorkid> ^
<killerpony7733> Shizuka: Some people have no sense of respect and it gets annoying when someone comes here and thinks they are funny
<ponibas> Allegr0, depends on which "under fire" you mean
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 IDK, you said it first
<Allegr0> ponibas: the literal kind ;)
<Ryunosuke> If you do not like what the mods are streaming, you can kindly SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET THE FUCK OUT. Just because you dont like what is being streamed, does NOT mean that other people are not trying to enjoy it. That is all.
<Buytoast> killerpony7733, you got a little something on your nose there
<Xaiden|Okari> Canadian_Brony: GIVE ME DAT RAINBOW DASH WALLPAER
<Allegr0> Canadian_Brony: well maybe that was your first test!
<Quick_Thinker> monkey wrote it makes sense
*ponibas agres with Ryunosuke
<CoalDust> lol i have no idea what i am watching but its making me laugh so
<Xaiden|Okari> *wallpaper
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: yeah well fuck that, star prequels?LETS HATE THE SHIT OUT OF IT

<killerpony7733> Buytoast: You got something on your chest :P
<cratorkid> kick!
<Shizuka> 13i love the darths and droids part of this
<Azuredragon> It's over Anakin! This high fround adds +5 to my agility!!!
<Shizuka> 13you're rooting for anakin and he rolls like a 2
<CriticKitten> It is called the Dark Side for a goddamn REASON.
<Xaiden|Okari> SLICE
<JESmith71> OMG HAX1
<cratorkid> floaty thing stops conveinently
<Canadian_Brony> Xaiden|Okari Ponies47 I'll send you both the pic, then a search with different resolutions
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> here it comes, the most retarded jedi move ever

<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: fucking hell, lets watch the movie TWICE and hate on it both times
<Shizuka> 13gets the biggest die out and fails it so bad, it's awesome
<Xaiden|Okari> Canadian_Brony: SWEET
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<Ryunosuke> I may not watch everything that is being streamed, HOWEVER, the mods are taking thier time out of thier day to give you entertainment, and when you go and piss all over that, that just irks me
<Derpy|Asleep> night everyone
<Shizuka> 13obi wan's talking to origin now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> night Derpy|Asleep
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Yay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: The EA service?
<Xaiden|Okari> wow bad pun
<Canadian_Brony> that failed miserably
<Ponies47> Night Derpy|Asleep
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what do they think balance mean ?
<CriticKitten> It's over Anakin! Everyone's forgotten about Episode 1, so high ground is suddenly meaningful!
<Azuredragon> http://derpy.me/bCNFT
<Allegr0> Shizuka: so...much...truth
<Xaiden|Okari> I HATE YOU
<Derpies> POPTARTS, I WANT ONE!
<cratorkid> i forget what game it was but you could actualy play as anikin and beat obi at the high ground
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> cratorkid: Lego Star Wars?
*ponibas rolls 2d10
<killerpony7733> cratorkid: Movie licensed game of the third episode,
<Xaiden|Okari> Derpies: I have some Brown Sugar and Cinamon, you want one?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How did he catch fire so easily?
<Derpies> YES
<Quick_Thinker> oh yeah i also feel like pointing out that lightsabers have a breaking point they last 400 years
<CriticKitten> Obi-Wan, for fuck's sake, stab him.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: Writers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, Wicker Man reference!
*Xaiden|Okari gives Derpies Poptart
<cratorkid> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2:
<Shizuka> 13more importantly
<CriticKitten> WHY.
<Xaiden|Okari> :P
<Allegr0> Nittany_Discord: the real question is why did it take that long?
<Shizuka> 13how did he catch on fire so easily there
<JESmith71> His clothes were soaked in gas?
<CriticKitten> WHY DID YOU WALK AWAY.
<Allegr0> Nittany_Discord: for both of them
<Shizuka> 13but not while he and obi were hovering inches above the lava river
<Derpies> YAY (shove in mouth)
<Quick_Thinker> also just saying again jedis know how to direct fire through force breath
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Wth has 3PO been doing the whole time
<ponibas> laval hot, why didn't they catch on fire earlier?
<Spriggals> Magic
<Buytoast> they had the sheild things
<Sumica> 00,10Plotarmor
<Buytoast> do you ot remember?
<Shizuka> 13convection only works if you believe in it i guess
<Derpies> Freindship is magic
<ponibas> lol
<Ponies47> Ohai Sumica
<cratorkid> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: no , not that one , it was for the xbox original
<ponibas> PlotKai!
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<Shizuka> 13(if comcast is this stable next week i might run the indy 1 and 4 riffs, not sure if they did 2 or 3 though)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Convection?
<Derpies> facepalm
<CriticKitten> Firstly, he was being tortured by burning to death. He's your brother and you love him, which is why you're leaving him to burn to death horrificly instead of mercy stabbing?
<Xaiden|Okari> Dat ugly bod
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thunderstorms are born from convection.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So are you saying that if the world stopped believing in convection, we could control the weather?
<Derpies> apples!
<Shizuka> 13oooo
<Allegr0> Nittany_Discord: we'd be pegasi!
<cratorkid> ^
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord seems legit
<CriticKitten> Secondly, there is NO good reason for him to walk away with Anakin still alive when he knows he can't afford to let Anakin live if the universe is to be saved. What's with the rage-quits during fights? :P
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, That doesn't already happen?
<killerpony7733> Allegr0: Yay pegasi!!!
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 but I wanna be an earth pony!
<Sabershy> Alledr0: Damn it. You took my line.
<ponibas> Shizu, Indy riffs??!?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<ponibas> woot!
<JESmith71> I was wondering when the Indy week was coming
<Sabershy> Wut is up with my spelling today?
<Xaiden|Okari> I'd be a Pegasus
<CriticKitten> Excuse me, sissy girl, er Master Yoda
<Xaiden|Okari> NO contest
<Canadian_Brony> Sabershy what is spelling?
<cratorkid> Xaiden|Okari: same
<Derpies> CAN I be jedi PLZ<3
<Shizuka> 13pirates next week too, not sure if i'll be the one streaming it though, unless comcast improves
<Xaiden|Okari> Derpies
<Xaiden|Okari> NO
<Xaiden|Okari> :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might Stream Indiana Jones.
<Shizuka> 13dad said he saw some comcast tech at walmart who said it's a problem all over the area here
<JESmith71> PotC and Indy? Awesome
<Derpies> wjy!
<Xaiden|Okari> BECAZ I GAVE U POPTART
<Sabershy> Shizuka: <3
<Xaiden|Okari> ;C
<Azuredragon> "Hey lady we can save you!" "No I have no will to live." "ok"
<Shizuka> 13she has lost the will to live, she realized she's been in all three prequels now
<Canadian_Brony> dat Wizard of Oz
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol reasons we cant explain
<Derpies> can i have hug plz!
*Canadian_Brony glomps Derpies
<CriticKitten> There's nothing medically wrong with her, even though she's dying from a known medical condition whose symptoms are treatable!
<Xaiden|Okari> Sure, DONT USE ALL THE FUTURISTIC MEDICAL EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE! JUST LET HER DIE!
<cratorkid> inb4 noooo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder how long Anakin would have lived without being put in that suit?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ooba?
<CriticKitten> Oooooba
<Derpies> not long
<Shizuka> 13and now
<Shizuka> 13anakin has pyrovision
<Shizuka> 13forever
<Xaiden|Okari> definately to late to change the will to live
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka LoLz
<Xaiden|Okari> Shizuka: THAT WUD BE AWESOME
<cratorkid> no it wouldnt
<Shizuka> 13hoo boy... here it comes
<Spriggals> Inb4 NOOOOOOOO everyone get ready!!!
<killerpony7733> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't Leia imply that Padme survive longer?
<cratorkid> how about nobody does it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In Ep 4 or 5?
<JESmith71> Oh god another round of huge NOOOO spam
<CriticKitten> Oddly enough, Vader's face in Return is not horrifically burned like Hayden is. It's almost like he magically got skin grafts or something.
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13how long is return after this?
<Sabershy> Nittany_Discord: Force Past Vision?
<Shizuka> 13it's like twenty years or something?
<CrimsonPhoenix> PREPARE YOUR BUTTON http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Shizuka> 13surely some of his burns would heal by then
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix LoLz
<Shizuka> 13aaaand
<Azuredragon> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Shizuka> 13A +M?!
<Shizuka> 13NOOOOOOOOO!
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Spriggals> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sabershy> NOOOOOOOOOOO!
<CriticKitten> Shizuka: He had third degree burns. Flesh burnt at that stage actually doesn't regenerate naturally, thus most victims at that level need skin grafts to replace the destroyed tissue.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Nittany_Discord> oooooooooooooooooo.
<JESmith71> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Allegr0> alright everypony, time to log off for the night
<Allegr0> see ya!
<cratorkid> night Allegr0
<Quick_Thinker> QUI GON YAY
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Is it Darth Maul?
<[Alpha]> easiest way to kill something. do the opposite
<Quick_Thinker> AND WHY DO WE NOT SEE HIM IN FUCKING NEW HOPE
<Shizuka> 13so they wipe c3po's brain, but not r2
<Shizuka> 13that means r2 is the most evil character in the entire series
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Shizuka: R2 cant talk
<cratorkid> Shizuka: r2 cant talk about it
<Shizuka> 13he could tell 3po
<cratorkid> ..... my god
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What was 3PO before then?
<Quick_Thinker> r2 cant talk to humans but he can speak to droids about it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ?
<JESmith71> Explains why 3PO doesn't recognize Jar Jar in Star Tours 2. Then again who would blame him for wanting to forget Jar Jar?
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: How come anakin can understand droid speak?
<CriticKitten> xD
<Quick_Thinker> tatoine
<Xaiden|Okari> Dat DEATH STAER
<Quick_Thinker> fuck if know
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> why was it faster for them to build a deathstar under a year?
<Xaiden|Okari> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<killerpony7733> Droid speak is very much possible thus people most likely being able to understand R2
<Ryunosuke> lol
<Azuredragon> More ships landing
<Quick_Thinker> man they already got to the uniforms and other shit that fast i thought it would take time
<cratorkid> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: would you want to build another death star after the first getts destroyed?
<Xaiden|Okari> Wow, those dick buildings are WAAAAYYY different then the ones from corasont
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<superretroworld> yes
<JESmith71> I just noticed they stole this shot in that Star Tours 2 commerical. But they replaced the ship with the StarSpeeder
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<CriticKitten> Xaiden: Well you see, this is the galaxy of Christmas Past From the Future.
<Quick_Thinker> aunt beru and uncle oan
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten seems legit
<Quick_Thinker> man they look young
<Quick_Thinker> hi LUKE CAMEO
<CriticKitten> And thousands of years ago, all buildings had to be phallic symbols.
<Xaiden|Okari> Quick_Thinker: AND ACTUALLY BANGABLE
<CriticKitten> It was required.
<Xaiden|Okari> :D
<Xaiden|Okari> EPIC ENDING
<JESmith71> Maybe they have more experience building it which is why the second got built quicker
<FlutterShy2000> :)
<Quick_Thinker> it is the best one
<Spriggals> Im going to hit the hay, night everyone
<MASF123> ponies now? :O
<cratorkid> noo

<Canadian_Brony> MUFFINS!!
<Shamroc> Shizuka: and now for another type of spam..
<Xaiden|Okari> Nittany_Discord: Hey, do you guys think you can stream this funny movie called Delat Farce?
<CriticKitten> It is the best of the prequels. But it's still full of problems. Just a shame that Lucas couldn't leave the series alone.
<Quick_Thinker> CHOCOLATE MUFFINSSSSSSSSSSSSS

<Xaiden> Well I guess I'll have to hire someone to make my Desktop Pony OC, It cost like $600 to get the software that you use to CREATE them.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i wanna see the Lion King world again in any sequel after KH 3D that would be neat hehe reminds me of KH 2 fighting Scar
<MASF123> no life kid maybe
<CrimsonPhoenix> and trust me as a kid you have A LOT of patience
<Ponies47> A easy game for kids. Any of the Lego games :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Don't tell me I have to go back :<
<Canadian_Brony> Patience is a virtue. A lesson never taught.
<MASF123> Not really, little kids throw tandrums all the time
<Dken2021> well there are logs there
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, this puzzle is quite complex I admit

<Ponies47> noname: I hated middle school -_-
<killerpony7733> SuperBrony64: My mom has the cd around somewhere at home
<noname> Ponies47: Me to
<Canadian_Brony> I went from elementary to high. No middle school for me . . . worst school year of my life was the first year of high school
<MASF123> Watch out foe the bats, falling axes, and projectiles! :O
<MASF123> for
<Canadian_Brony> going to the bathroom was like Mission Impossible

<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 nah, I opted out for this http://www.redbubble.com/people/edoxile/works/8632633-drink-cider-learn-nothing?p=t-shirt
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Oh yeah. When does school start for you?
<Canadian_Brony> beginning of September
<Dken2021> this game has some pretty impressive sprites
<Canadian_Brony> high hopes S3 will be out by then
<MASF123> Hardest part of this level are the minecart looking part and the mad doctor boss battle
<Ponies47> Same September 3rd for. It would be the 4th but you know freshman only day -_-
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02fuuuuu
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: NEXT!

<noname> Ponies47: Look at the bright side of starting school, season 3 comes out :)
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I didn't have a "Freshman day" at the beginning of the year. Near the end of Grade 7 (last one before high), all the grade 7's walked over to the high school most of us would attend.
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 first day of Grade 8 was terrifying
<Canadian_Brony> left and right I'm dogding huge crowds and anyone with a beard
<Canadian_Brony> who isn't over 30
<MASF123> Mickey Mouse and Donlad Duck in World of Illusion is a much easier game, you should play that next if you want.
<Ponies47> noname: LE GASP! You are so right. No wait... I'll be able to watch them but of coarse keep it sevret. With starting a new school and all NOBODY must know I watch MLP they would all ahte me and plus it would be a repeat of middle school no friends :<

<[Scootaloo]> O_o what did i just say
<Canadian_Brony> prince-dari no. I also think it deserves a sequel which should be appropriately titled "District 10"
<prince-dari> Pfft
<Canadian_Brony> you can't tell me what not to like!
<prince-dari> District 13 is a better film
<prince-dari> It has David Belle
<prince-dari> Automatically 999x better
<AdamTheDuck> God how many districts are there?
<Canadian_Brony> when I hear that, I immediately picture "Hunger Games"
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck originally, there were 13. After a war, 12 were left crippled. The 13th was obliterated.
<Phase4> 00,02anyone else have this game?
<Phase4> 00,02need crew
<AdamTheDuck> Sadly no. :(
<somepony_else> i don't have it, but i'm thinking about buying it. looks neat
<Canadian_Brony> And thus came The Hunger Games themselves.
*AdamTheDuck has no idea what The Hunger Games are.
<[Scootaloo]> AdamTheDuck: :O
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck a trilogy of novels centered around Panem, a war-tattered place formally known as North America. I highly suggest anyone to read it.
<[Scootaloo]> well its a game and.... jeez im hungry
*[Scootaloo] getting something to eat
<[Scootaloo]> i watched it read it and everything
<[Scootaloo]> TIS THE BEST AND DESERVES THY CANTERLOT VOICE

*RainBowJack smiles and keeps [Scootaloo] close "your the best CMC "
<[Scootaloo]> YAY
<AdamTheDuck> Canadian_Brony: Why do I have a feeling that the story involves some type of rebellion group to overthrow the power hungry hierarchy of some sort?
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck because that's what it is.
<RainBowJack> whats this game called?
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck 13 districts. 12 crippled, the 13th obliterated.

<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent: Guns of Icarus
<Malavolent> Is it multiplayer?
<Canadian_Brony> Malavolent eeyup
<Mutterguy> yep
<Malavolent> Looks pretty cool.
<Jake> and 5€ on steam
<Mutterguy> Sumica Do a barrel roll!
<AdamTheDuck> No this is the online one, it's still in closed beta.
<AdamTheDuck> Can't buy it yet.
<Jake> makes sense too
<Mutterguy> Don't ask how to do a barrel roll in an airship...
<Canadian_Brony> How do you do a barrel roll in an airship?
<RainBowJack> do a Barrel rol
<d3rb> with great difficulty
<Canadian_Brony> I see . . .
<Jake> ok you can buy guns of Icarus online in 1 month, 1 week, 6 days and 7 hours
<d3rb> and 4 minutes
<Mutterguy> I think the crew should sing old sailor chanty
<Canadian_Brony> it's an airship, it should be able to float in water
<Canadian_Brony> that is water down there, right?
<Malavolent> Nope, lava.
<Malavolent> The floor is lava.
<Canadian_Brony> blue lava?
<Jake> it's apocalyptical water
<Malavolent> Sure.
<d3rb> make thicker hulls then float on the lava
<Jake> or acid
<AdamTheDuck> Just use duct tape.
<AdamTheDuck> Problem solved.
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck I approve.
<Jake> just use nokia
<Malavolent> Duct tape is like the Force.
<d3rb> duct tape 3210s to the hull
<Malavolent> It has its light and dark side and keeps universe together.
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent: Dat metaphor.
<Canadian_Brony> hmmph
<RainBowJack> Duck tape repairs almost anything
<Malavolent> If not, you're not using it enough.
<Canadian_Brony> okay, I'm hitting the hay. G'night everypony.
<Mutterguy> except surprisingly ducks for a given value of fix
<Sumica> 00,10that was anoying
<AdamTheDuck> Night Canadian_Brony
<Jake> the ultimate how to fix anything flowchart: is it moving > Yes > should it move > No > Duct Tape
<Malavolent> Sleep well, Canadian_Brony.
<RainBowJack> hey Sumica would you add me to steam?
<d3rb> take it easy Canadian_Brony
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica: That's because you need to use more duct tape
<Canadian_Brony> I will now read until I can read nomore because I look like this http://mlpf.im/1eh

<ninja_pony> i need more tehn that
<Serenity> I doubt it, I can only imagine 3-4 seasons discontinueing
<d3rb> is the number of episodes confirmed or just rumour, i thoguht nothing was set in stone yet
<MegaMoonShine> Personally I'd say maybe 5 or 6 seasons
<Serenity> I can say that chances are Bronydom will probably by dead by Season 4 or 5

<MegaMoonShine> The sound is fine
<Sundaysmile> buffering
<Serenity> Sound seems alright from here
<Noir> It's buffering on my end.
<shana> hard to tell if its in sync from this video
<MegaMoonShine> Hooray ads!
<Noir> Oi vey
<Saturn> 08,01british adverts

<P4ngya> dafuq
<P4ngya> dat hair
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: the 2nd non-canon film
<Eli> sounds nice
<Saturn> 08,01it's based on the 1st Doctor's serials, but it has Peter Cushing as The Doctor
<Saturn> 08,01so it's not actually considered canon
<Saturn> 08,01but it's good fun
<Saturn> 08,01and it has Daleks
<Serenity> Exterminita?
<Eli> yeah... i'm not really familiar with british actors. who's peter cushing?
<Lil_B> ouuu they have a rainbow hard on these lottery tickets :3
<Lil_B> hearts*
<Eli> as long as it has daleks i'm happy
<Saturn> 08,01the stream might buffer for a few minutes
<Chrysalis> hey guys
<MegaMoonShine> hey Chrysalis :)
<Lil_B> hia Chrysalis :)
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: Peter Cushing is that british imperial guy from Star Wars
<Noir> Hey Chrysalis.
<Serenity> Britain is fucking corrupted by bloody Bingo nowadays
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off, night everyone. :)
<Serenity> 2/5 adverts are Bingo adverts
<MegaMoonShine> Night AdamTheDuck :)
<Lil_B> bye AdamTheDuck
<Eli> what episode of Star Wars?
<Serenity> Oh dear
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: no idea
<Serenity> El shitbox is not coping with this memroy leak well
<MegaMoonShine> Episode 4
<Saturn> 08,01that one with Peter Cushing, i presume
<Serenity> If it's Tarkin, I'd presume 4
<Eli> can't remember him
<shana> 'real people, not actor' => actors are not real people?
<Saturn> 08,01shana: of course not
<Kandarihu> So, this channel. It's just called 5?
<Eli> shana: what are you thinking? everyone knows they're not
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: yup
<Serenity> Hmmm, getting an fps of around 3-6 on stream
<Serenity> Channel 5

<Lil_B> dots*
<Noir> it looks like a slide show to me.
<Serenity> Oh noes, Dahlekz
<MegaMoonShine> Gotta go, be back in a bit
*Noir smacks the video refreash icon to get it to work on his side.
<TrixieMuffin> what do you call a little filly that wants to EXTERMINATE you ? A Daaaaawlek
<Noir> Maybe it's becuase i'm watching this from Anchorage AK.
<Noir> Bloody buffering, why wont Google just take over already and set up my neck of the woods with fiber internet already?
<shana> Noir: there's no stream right now so don't try to hard :)

<TrixieMuffin> Tennis at the olympics .......i dont even ..... what next ? double dodge ?
<Saturn> 08,01Del Potro is very much like Federrer, but without so much elegance
<Serenity> Tennis has been olympic for years
<Saturn> 08,01Djokovich plays a fast game
<MadSurge> Italy is owning America in this fencing match on tv :O
<Saturn> 08,01but this is on grass, so it's not going to be too fast to comprehend
*Saturn 08,01prefers lawn tennis
<Lil_B> I still want some kind of serious e-Sport Olympics :/
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: start it

<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: woo! \o/
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<Lil_B> Eli sry, I don't follow olympics and i couldn't see a flag :P
<Eli> he's wearing red and white
<Lil_B> Eli yeah... well, that could have been Austria as well or Poland XD

<derpy_pony> hi :)
<pony_7008> What movie is it?
<derpy_pony> is this that underwater movie where their own dreams kill them?
<bob> is the voice off a bit?
<Flyboy> oh wow...
<Wrek> 05bob: probably there is a chance the audio delays using this cap device
<Wrek> 05was too lazy to change back
<fRizZ> im scaredd
<fRizZ> what is this.
<bob> eh as long as the captions are fine :D
<derpy_pony> the pressure will kill him first
<fRizZ> WAHTA
<fRizZ> what is sthiss???
<fRizZ> looks like aliens vs predator
<Cypresswolf> Would have been crushed like a soda can as soon as he opened the hatch
<bob> wouldnt he drown if he took the medicine
<Wrek> 05Cypresswolf: why?
<fRizZ> lmao was that the guy of matrix
<fRizZ> the blue pill red pill guy
<Cypresswolf> they're at the sea floor, the pressure outside would be far greater than the pressure in the room
<Wrek> 05fRizZ: nope
<Wrek> 05thats anotehr black guy
<fRizZ> aww
<fRizZ> hahaha
<fRizZ> Movie name anyone?
<bob> i feel like watching the matrix :P
<fRizZ> lmfao
<fRizZ> LMAOL Madness
<Wrek> 05Cypresswolf: i guess the room depreassurized when the water began flooding
<Wrek> 05hence the jars exploding
<Herostar_Discorded> eww
<Alchemist> ohai
<Wrek> 05so when the thatch finally opened it wasnt that big a deal
<derpy_pony> one metric ton of pressure per square meter and meter of water depth
<Herostar_Discorded> dead body O_O;
<Wrek> 05oh right
<Wrek> 05i forgot the depth preassure in general
<Wrek> 05yeah probably
<fRizZ> id laugh if the door opend and smashed him in the face
<JRP2234> WREK IS SPY!!!!!!!
<Flyboy> fRizZ: it opens upwards
<fRizZ> fml
<Herostar_Discorded> -didn't read sign that said cauton door opens from above
<fRizZ> :<
<fRizZ> shes all like "my precciousss"
<Spriggals> How did his hair dry that fast?
<derpy_pony> he is a changeling! kill it!
<bob> why dont they get in the subway and leave
<Wrek> 05then again he'd probably be in hypothermia now aswell
<Wrek> 05so lets say
<Wrek> 05movie logic
<Wrek> 05that should solve these things
<fRizZ> lmao id laugh if he did the ya dont say face and said "nooo im a ghost"
<fRizZ> id prob die
<bob> everyone went into the sphere lets just say that
<derpy_pony> probably

<Gamefreak324> see i was on everfree radio
<Gamefreak324> oh well then
<Gamefreak324> but anyway
<Gamefreak324> and a song came
<Gamefreak324> on
<derpy_pony> flood kick?
<Gamefreak324> i cannot remember it
<alexxm> really they're using cgi
<alexxm> ok most of the guys are costumes
<Gamefreak324> all i know about it is that in the name were the letters dhg
<Serenity> alexxm: Think about godzilla, think how crap it'ta looked if it was CGI
<derpy_pony> the hairy guy is real. probably from denmark
<Gamefreak324> you guys got anything
<Gamefreak324> ???
<Wrek> 05hey
<derpy_pony> this is not enough, Gamefreak324
<Wrek> 05you try to pull off a realistic insectoid as a human
<Wrek> 05you are too fat
<alexxm> Serenity i know i wasn't saying i was happy about the cgi
<MadSurge> SUDDENDLY
<Gamefreak324> damn it
<Serenity> alexxm: I know, I was agreeeing :3
<Gamefreak324> i was hoping you guys wpuld have something
<Wrek> 05regarding what?
<alexxm> oh ok Serenity
<Serenity> *Ponyshrug*
<derpy_pony> there are 30gb of pony songs around
<derpy_pony> ask the station for the playlist it used at this point of time
<Gamefreak324> but everfree radio tends to stick to the samme stuff
<MadSurge> Star Trek!
<derpy_pony> that might narrow it down to 10 to 20 songs
<Serenity> That reminds me, I should totally vote for Godzilla for filmnight as a B
<Gamefreak324> ok the lyrics were
<Gamefreak324> some of them at least
<Buytoast> which godzilla
<RoboGerbil> in b4 the xindi blow up earth
<teentro> good morning everyone :D
<Serenity> Possibly Vs. Mothra
<Wrek> 05Gamefreak324: we dont have any affiliatiosn with them as far as i know
<derpy_pony> hi teentro :)
<Gamefreak324> twilight sparkle pinkie applejack and fluttershy
<Serenity> Only worry is, there's a 70% chance the mods don't currently have godzilla vs. Mothra in their playlists
<MadSurge> WHAT, Star Trek aliens that aren't just people with skin conditions? :O
<Gamefreak324> and i know that most songs don't name evry pony in a row
<derpy_pony> major on the same table as a sergeant? don't they have any manner in starfleet?
<teentro> what is it we are looking at???
<Serenity> teentro: The stream
<teentro> :O
<teentro> realy???
<Serenity> Yeh
<teentro> o gosh :S
<MadSurge> teentro: Star Trek Enterprise
<teentro> this was realy...

<Gamefreak324> i check it out after this
<Gamefreak324> hell on second thought i'll just request it
<derpy_pony> there it is /watch?v=viTkj0eu-fk
*Serenity glares at derpy_pony
<derpy_pony> what?
<Wrek> 05you know damn well what you did
<Jmo4267> I lol'd
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly chat died
<Gamefreak324> accidentally closed the tab
<Jmo4267> It's your fault.
<bob> pie ._.
*Jmo4267 slaps AdamTheDuck
<derpy_pony> meh
<TheMaster> Star Trek game?
<[Ghost-Alpha]> http://derpy.me/Lk6Pd
<TheMaster> or just an episode?
<Gamefreak324> i requested Flutterwonder (Underp0ny Remix)
<Serenity> [Ghost-Alpha]: Me likey
<[Ghost-Alpha]> :D
<AdamTheDuck> I never find these Soviet Russia jokes funny...
<Gamefreak324> that the one?
<Serenity> I want a burger bed
<TheMaster> i'm so confused. Is that really a Star Trek opening theme?
<[Ghost-Alpha]> I do too but I could not resist ading that joke
<Gamefreak324> ok i would rather watch a video game than star trek
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Serenity: a burger bed? or a "i want a burger, bad!"
<Gamefreak324> i'm not that big of a fan
<Serenity> Bed
<Serenity> I'm vegetarian :3
<Big_Macintosh_1992> oh
<String_Shredder> AdamTheDuck: In capitalist America, bank rob you
<[Ghost-Alpha]> :D
<derpy_pony> everyfree radio sure hides the audiostream button well
<TheMaster> If its Star Trek it should be either the Original Series or TNG
<Wrek> 05id love to make you a veg burger though Serenity
<TrixieMuffin> i wanna eat a burgerwhile being eaten by that burger
<[Ghost-Alpha]> ^
<AdamTheDuck> String_Shredder: But don't many banks rip you off one way or another?
<Gamefreak324> derpy_pony: did i request the right one
<Serenity> Wrek: It's alright, my diet is cake and vengence
<Gamefreak324> PONY SWAG!!!!
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Yay I sparked a conversation
<Gamefreak324> first brony song i ever heard!!
<Jmo4267> This reminds me of the veg burger BBQ. It never happened.
<[Ghost-Alpha]> :S:D
<Gamefreak324> six point star and BOOM MIC!
<Serenity> I've never had a vegburger, I bet they are horrible
<Jmo4267> Neither have I.
<Wrek> 05Serenity; in america? probably
<Jmo4267> :>
<[Ghost-Alpha]> I've had a veggie burger
<Wrek> 05over here? they are good
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Well, I guess I should sleep, got off work after a night shift. Have a good one guys
<Wrek> 05home made? fuckign awesome
<Jmo4267> Night Big_Macintosh_1992
<Gamefreak324> The megamix converted me to the herd
<Serenity> Wrek: I'm in Britain, so I'm not sure here
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Big_Macintosh_1992
<derpy_pony> I prefer the original, Gamefreak324. But this one is good too
<Gamefreak324> oh yea
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Mine was mostly composed of beans and corn
<Serenity> I've sometimes considered going somewhere in Europe for holiday
<Gamefreak324> haters
<Gamefreak324> yay
<Gamefreak324> 20% cooler
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Can I link the welcome song?
<Gamefreak324> lol
<TheMaster> why would a vulcan wear a shirt that didn't cover her stomach? that is highly illogical
<Serenity> I was thinking of going to Italy for all the pizza and such
<Alchemist> TheMaster: it depends whats her intensions ;)
<Serenity> Because I like most italian foods
<Gamefreak324> this remix was made very well
<Wrek> 05also TheMaster
<[Ghost-Alpha]> I'll eat anything except shillean food
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Chillean
<Wrek> 05sto pbeing populist
<Serenity> I'm not really a food eater
<Serenity> I pretty much can survive on 1 meal per day
<TheMaster> populist? What?
<Gamefreak324> swag
<Alchemist> Serenity: yeah...survive. Most people can do more than just survive :)
<derpy_pony> this one is awesome, Gamefreak324
<Wrek> 05nah, but really you shouldnt bash otehr star trek branches jsut cause they arent tng
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Same here serenity but I have really high metabulism so it doesn't work out well
<Alchemist> can = want to
<Gamefreak324> yay pony parodies
<Gamefreak324> LOL
<Serenity> Alchemist: Considering I do lot of running about and such, eating as much as I do and doing what I do will really kill your will
<TheMaster> I actually like the original more then TNG. I just found the opening theme song to be a little off for a star trek sort of thing.
<Gamefreak324> OH THIS IS GOLDEN!
<[Ghost-Alpha]> What is it Gamefreak?
<TheMaster> Though I do like the obvious higher production values for this.
<Gamefreak324> this is made very well
<Gamefreak324> get on everfree radio
<[Ghost-Alpha]> here p.m the link
<Serenity> You can tell they spent quite a budget on this show, but unfortunately, the acting isn't up to scratch with what it could be
<Serenity> That's my only crtitizism on this show
<Alchemist> Serenity: Im not saying you have to change your habits, but note that its probably not healthy to eat only once per day (no matter what size that meal is)
<TheMaster> Well the first two had the benefit of clasically trained actors heading the main roles
<Gamefreak324> there ya go
<TheMaster> both Shatner and Stewart did a lot of shakespeare
<Serenity> Alchemist: I know that, but I've done it for years.
<Gamefreak324> next is one in a million then flutterwonder
<Alchemist> Serenity: doing it for years doesnt make it more healthy :D
<Dark_Horst> well, that escalated wuickly
<Dark_Horst> dammit, q-key, why do you elude me?
<Gamefreak324> top left
<Alchemist> I've done the same for a long time
<dshannon> awwww yeah
<Dark_Horst> i know where it is, but somehow it doesnt want to get hit
<Dark_Horst> must be some sort of improbability field around it
<Serenity> Alchemist: Don't forget you can get nutrition from drinks as well, which is something I have quite a bit more than food to be fair.
<Serenity> Nowhere near as much as food, but still some :)
<Dark_Horst> let the rape commence
<Dark_Horst> or dinner
<Gamefreak324> um
<dshannon> or both
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Fight to the death
<Serenity> Hmm, I wonder what's for dinner
<Alchemist> Serenity: of course, and there are pills that have all the vitamins you need for a day, but it doesnt mean you dont need to eat
<Gamefreak324> is it just me or does this song suck?
<[Ghost-Alpha]> it's alright
<Gamefreak324> i hate it lots
<[Ghost-Alpha]> I listen to electronic music so much I consider myslef part robot
<TheRandomkid321> I am sick as hell currently... and D ABUCK IS DIS!?
<Alchemist> Serenity: long story short, if you are fine with it then do it, just know there are alternatives.
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Star Trek
<Gamefreak324> end already!!
<TheRandomkid321> If Ya gave me a chanch to see the enterprise I douldve guessed. Then again I asked.
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Gamefreak just mute it
<Gamefreak324> i don't care how you do it!
<Jim> Good morning Bronystate!
<Wrek> 05Gamefreak324: jsut mute it you douche
<Gamefreak324> yes
<Alchemist> good afternnon Jim :)
<[Ghost-Alpha]> it's over and you put the volume all the way down
<Gamefreak324> it is now gone
<TheRandomkid321> So.. What is Bob Ross (my name for him) pony painting today? Twilight still? Alrighty then.
<Jmo4267> Hey Jim :)
<Gamefreak324> :( they skipped flutterwonder
<[Ghost-Alpha]> FYI Stormwolf and Glaze are good Brony artists
<Serenity> Eyup, Jim
<Jim> So what's going on today then?
<Gamefreak324> wtf!!
<TheMaster> where does enterprise take place in the star trek timeline?
<Serenity> Jim: Sod all
<TheMaster> is this well after TNG?
<Gamefreak324> angry face
<Dark_Horst> The_Greener: before tng
<Dark_Horst> The_Greener: infact, before tos
<Gamefreak324> it'll probably come up next
<Wrek> 05this is about 2 or 3 lifetimes post the zefphram cochrane laucnh
<Wrek> 05iirc
<Dark_Horst> it's the enterprise prototype
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Gamefreak I can give you the link to the orginal version of the song
<Gamefreak324> i'll wait
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, wrong ping, againm
*The_Greener slaps Dark_Horst. Learn to tab better :P
<TheRandomkid321> Nowadyas there is almost always a stream.
<Gamefreak324> i like this one
<Dark_Horst> you people stop using the "the"-prefix like crack
<TheRandomkid321> Zat Vas Delicious.
<Gamefreak324> did he just eat a mask-full of maggots?
<Dark_Horst> yummy
<bob> would you people eats a pot full of maggots if he offered it
<Wrek> 05looked more liked mashed banana
<TheRandomkid321> If you find this gross go to australia. We have something thta is almost identicle just instead of bugs its tiny insects. The type that gather around your computer screen at midnight.
<TheRandomkid321> Not many people know of it.
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Flutterwonder is on Gamefreak
<Gamefreak324> here it is
<bob> fruitflies?
<Gamefreak324> so wait what's this you sent me??
<derpy_pony> :)
<TheRandomkid321> Master Chief
<[Ghost-Alpha]> Beyond her garden by woodentoaster
<Gamefreak324> yea but
<Wrek> 05[Ghost-Alpha], Gamefreak324. please keep your EFR talk in PM
<[Ghost-Alpha]> sorry
<Gamefreak324> does it have anything to do with flutterwonder
<derpy_pony> the new one from woodentoaster is good too. "awoken"
<Gamefreak324> oh alright
<derpy_pony> hm...
<Wrek> 05i had forgotten these EPs were 40 mintues long :D
<[Alpha]> Well I'm done with the ghost part of my name
<dshannon> mind fudge in -3..-10...-20
<[Alpha]> hmmm
<Wrek> 05and then
<Wrek> 05the chat stood silent once more
<bob> hi
<TheMaster> what race is the black guy in the red uniform?
<Wrek> 05unkown
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: jackassian
<Wrek> 05do you know the story so far of this branch?
<Wrek> 05id happily fill you in a bit
<Jmo4267> STORY TIME!
<TheMaster> This episode or the series?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: please do
<Wrek> 05this part of the series
<TheMaster> go ahead. I'm interested. is enterprise the most current Star Trek?
<Wrek> 05besides the recent movie i do think so
<Wrek> 05only got 4 season made though due to low ratings
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: the newest series, but it takes place pre-TOS
<alexxm> any news on the sequel the new movies getting
<Wrek> 05the lowe ratigns are kind of understandable casue the 2 first seasons were slow and quite boring
<Wrek> 05but the latter 2 seasons were really nice
<TheMaster> They better hurry or Chris Pine and the rest of the actors will get too old, unless thats what they're going for
<Jim> What show was this again?
<alexxm> how old was chris pine when he did this
<Wrek> 05right now however there was an attack on earth. the only starship in sue at the time is equipped with more lillitary equipment than standard.
<Wrek> 05use
<Wrek> 05m*
<TheMaster> so this is pre-kirk and all that?
<Wrek> 05the attack was jsut a test probe made by the race called xindi
<Wrek> 05yes
<alexxm> yeah
<Wrek> 05this is like only 2 or 3 lifetimes after the first warp launch
<Wrek> 05now the prope originated from waht is known as the expanse
<TheMaster> neat. So they don't get bogged down in the canon made in TNG. no Q, Borg etc.
<Wrek> 05and now the enterprise of the time is sent into the expanse to find the xindi
<alexxm> i think the borg appear in one episode
<Wrek> 05this is the 3rd episode of season 3. the beginnign of the xindi chapter
<Jim> that's not how you se a gun
<TheMaster> thats pretty big for a phaser. Not invented yet?
<Dark_Horst> you're fucked now
<MadSurge> So why did fans really dislike this series?
<Jim> Brn!
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: they are. those guys just are someone else
<Wrek> 05actualyl in the first season they didnt have phasers untill liek the last few episodes
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: also, there are phasers in rifle from
<Wrek> 05they were prototypes then
<Wrek> 05heck the ship didnt get torpedoes untill liek 3 episodes ago
<TheMaster> I always liked the phasers over the blasters in star wars. It always bothered me that light could be blockable/dodgeable
<Dark_Horst> yeah, they had normal boring missiles for a long time
<Wrek> 05right now though the humasn have "handgun" prototype phaserrs and blaster rifles
<Cypresswolf> :3 I should be at work by now - I'm trying to track a co worker down
<Wrek> 05hopefully you get to see soem more of the ship soon
<Wrek> 05for isntance shield tech doesnt exist yet
<Dark_Horst> they also dont use shields. they just polarize the armor palting of the hull
<alexxm> this can't be good
<Dark_Horst> damn you wrek
<TheMaster> thats pretty cool. Is good that they didn't rush things techwise
<Wrek> 05whic his probably why many fans hated it
<Wrek> 05i mean come on
<Wrek> 05whats? a star trek without sheield and phazurs? preposterous
<TheMaster> maybe they just wanted more holo-deck episodes
<Dark_Horst> i dont get it. shouldnt it be interesting to see how all that fancy tech started out?
<Dark_Horst> i know I find it interesting
<Wrek> 05same here
<Wrek> 05but really
<Saturn> 08,01wheee
<Wrek> 05you are a brony right?
<Saturn> 08,01no?
<Wrek> 05you know how stubborn fandoms can be
<Saturn> 08,01s/an/em/
<Zawan> the fans should be more open
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny because i used a regex to make a bdsm joke
<Dark_Horst> sometimes it seems we all just want to burn whatÄs new
<Jim> only you :p
<TheMaster> hah. Fandom gets mad when a canon map gets put out
<TheMaster> "it ruined my headcanon!"
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: ...they got mad over that?
<[Alpha]> Bass Cannon?
<TheMaster> Some did
<Dark_Horst> ...now this i seriously dont get
<[Alpha]> :P
<Wrek> 05also the first season was very slow and generalyl dull
<Wrek> 05acting on sexy vulcan to keep it going
<Saturn> 08,01ah, still watching Enterprise?
<Wrek> 05now and then they had to "decontaminate" by being practically nekkid in a blue lit room crasing themselves in
<Buytoast> fandoms get all butthurt whenever someone doesn't fit into their little square peg hivemind
<TheMaster> No Vulcan is sexier then that junior officer in Wrath of Khan
<TheMaster> adorable Vulcan was adorable
<Wrek> 05Saturn: yeah wanted to finish disc 1
<alexxm> i feel as if the ending theme would have been the better opening theme
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<Jim> Hi RaveBrony !
<TheMaster> I wish the TNG movies were half as good as the Original series movies
<alexxm> how you doing RaveBrony
*RaveBrony waves to Jim and alexxm :$
<RaveBrony> Im doing good, and yourself?
<alexxm> i'm good
<pony1553> wat movie is this?
<Gamefreak324> mornin meh brony brotha
<Dark_Horst> pony1553: series
<TheMaster> where are the Klingons by the way? Arn't they suppose to be the bogeymen of the federation at this time?
<pony1553> k
<Wrek> 05there were actually alot of kingons early on
<Wrek> 05but this takes place in the expans mostly
<Wrek> 05expanse*
<Wrek> 05in fact
<Wrek> 05the very first episdoe has klingons
<TheMaster> do they look like they do in the original or do they have the wrinkly forheads?
<TrixieMuffins> i wonder , do klingons in this series look like the old klingons ? or the new ones ?
<TheMaster> mindhive
<Wrek> 05wrinkly foreheads
<Wrek> 05atleast partially
<TheMaster> But I thought they said the wrinkly forheads were from a plague, or they were like cloned...something klingons
<TheMaster> like Krogans in mass effect
<Wrek> 05for season 3 and 4 they changed the blue lit grease-up with the massages
<TheMaster> Does Archer have some sort of disease?
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: i wouldnt be suprised if it was casue "tng had wrikly foreheads adn they have had for a while so the make up artist gave them it"
<Wrek> 05but meh
<Brother-Aura> What the fuck is this?
<Dark_Horst> enterprise
<Wrek> 05Brother-Aura: why so hostile?
<TheMaster> I guess that fans would be confused if they went back to the original Klingons. Unless they had tribbles attached to their uniforms
<Wrek> 05might be that too
<Wrek> 05as for archer beign sick
<Wrek> 05im afraid i dont udnerstadn your question
<TheMaster> You said that they had a blue gel thing and then switched to massages.
<TheMaster> Does Archer just have Kirk-like swag and wants a Vulcan chick to rub him down every episode or is there a reason.
<Wrek> 05oh
<Wrek> 05that is archer
<Wrek> 05the one getting the massage is tucker
<Wrek> 05the engineer
<Gamefreak324> quite the scabs he's got
<TheMaster> ah okay.
<Wrek> 05but as i was saying. you know there always is those episodes where they get a virus or something
<Wrek> 05and as quaranten after away missions
<Wrek> 05blue lit room and creasing
<Wrek> 05greasing*
<Wrek> 05it hurt the show more than it added
<TheMaster> sort of seems like they just did it for fan-service
<Wrek> 05yeah it was
<Dark_Horst> they sure did
<Wrek> 05to 80%
<Wrek> 05"How can we keep people interested in the new branch?" "grease up the vulcan chick!"
<RaveBrony> O.o
<TheMaster> the tone is a little different then the star-trek i'm use to. I actually thought this was star gate when I first saw the opening scene before the theme
<TheMaster> more military-adventure then the science fictiony
<Wrek> 05well it kidna does fit
<Dark_Horst> greta archer. you made him sad
<Wrek> 05we have jsut recently gotten used to the "not alone in space" thing
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt be suprised if the old millitant roots still sit in
<Wrek> 05if that makes sense
<TheMaster> they need Kirk to show them that the future should be making out with green skinned chicks.
<TheMaster> or Picard on the merits of drinking tea
<Wrek> 05picard got me to try earl grey
<alexxm> or Q
<Wrek> 05been drenkign it for breakfast quite often sicne then
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05wehn i wake up
<Wrek> 05not neccesarily breakfast
<Dark_Horst> space hookers
<[Alpha]> :O
<TheMaster> Wrek do you like game of thrones at all?
<alexxm> i'd buy that for a dollar
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: streamed both seasons alteady >:3
<TheMaster> damn. I missed it
<Wrek> 05waiting for the 3rd now
<RaveBrony> Skilled xD
<TheMaster> man. I don't know how they'll fit Storm of Swords in one season
<TheMaster> I can't wrap my brain around it
<TheMaster> theres just too much that happens
<Wrek> 05i actualyl read the books post the watchign the seasons
<RaveBrony> Wrek: When is th e 3rd season supposed to come out?
<TheMaster> april
<Wrek> 05but i havent read further than the seasons have gone ish
<dshannon> aaaanndd sprrroinnnnnng
<RaveBrony> :D
<TheMaster> Jaqen H'gar is like 50x cooler in the tv series then in the books
<TheMaster> i'm convinced he's actually a time lord assasin
<Jim> hay gaaaaaauuuy
<pony1553> Sup Jim
<Dark92Enigma> I'M BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Jim> Welcome back Dark92Enigma
*Dark92Enigma hugs everypony
<alexxm> how you doing Dark92Enigma
<TheMaster> slavery? in my star trek?
<pony1553> SPACE WHORE GONE WILD
<Jim> TheMaster, It's more likely than you think.
<Wrek> 05nooo not the critters!
<TheMaster> so did the federation not share its replicator technology?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm I'm fine, just got off the hook (i'm not grounded anymore)
<RaveBrony> The poor wildlife D:
<TheMaster> you'd think that would end all conflict save for stuff with crazy races like the borg
<Jim> not the space bunnies!
<Dark92Enigma> Didn't the NC reviewed this one? <---
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: you mean in this?
<Wrek> 05Dark92Enigma: if he did i havent seen it
<TheMaster> Well star trek in general? does the federation in this not have replicators?
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i don't think so
<Wrek> 05not yet
<Wrek> 05they still have a shef!
<Wrek> 05;D
<Wrek> 05chef*
<Wrek> 05in fact you can barely call it a federation yet
<Wrek> 05more like a vulcan/human alliance
<Wrek> 05with some bonuses
<Dark92Enigma> This is Star Trek: The Series.........not Star Trek: Generations, right?
<TheMaster> how do replicators work anyway? Can the federation just mass produce any matter they want for less energy then the put out?
<pony1553> I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE SHIP!!
<Wrek> 05this is not generations
<Dark92Enigma> oh, now i remember...........this is the series!
<Buytoast> give er the dick
<Buytoast> c'mno man
<TheMaster> hopefully they don't accidently give him ginger. Some races like that more then is healthy
<Dark_Horst> balck pepper. it's awesome invaluable luxury stuff. trust us
<TheMaster> nobody will get that reference...
<Wrek> 05hehe
<pony1553> SPACE DRUGS(AKA spice)
<Wrek> 05nice one
<Wrek> 05oh also
<Wrek> 05i didnt tell you
<TheMaster> oh you read harry turtledove?
<alexxm> he's happy
<Wrek> 05the substance trellium D shields the ships in the expanse from the gravitonic distortions
<Dark_Horst> inb4 he snorts it
<Wrek> 05but the enterprise doesnt have that shielding yet
<Wrek> 05hecne the inconvenience
<Wrek> 05for isntance they were raided by pirates jsut casue they were knocked out by a distrotion
<TheMaster> seeing low-tech star trek is pretty cool.
<TheMaster> I've read what late federation tech is like and its pretty crazy
<TheMaster> Time Lord crazy
<Bacon[Hazard]> What's up?
<Wrek> 05for isntance the final ep of TNG
<Wrek> 05seeign the tech on the "future" ships was awesome IMO
<Wrek> 05but it works both ways
<pony1553> I hate those uniforms, I liked the old ones better
<TheMaster> the full body yellow and red ones?
<pony1553> yup
<Wrek> 05also TheMaster: pony1553 is a practical example of why it got low reviews
<Buytoast> it's time for space hanky-panky
<Wrek> 05nah jsut joking
<Bacon[Hazard]> This looks interesting... oh damn it all... I have to go. Bye!
<TheMaster> well I always thought the federation was really sort of like if you fused the air force with NASA
<dshannon> awwwww yeah
<TheMaster> like they're not sure how military-ish they should be.
<Wrek> 05right now they have a millitary troop onboard
<Wrek> 05and there is some friction between them and the crew
<Serenity> Hey everypont
<Serenity> and suddenly, I come back to sexy time
<TheMaster> makes sense. It would be expensive to try and make two kinds of ships
<Buytoast> unleash the power of the sun
<Wrek> 05suddenly i am a pont
<RaveBrony> Lol!! xD
<TheMaster> oh god. Is that guy a cylon?
<Dark_Horst> MIND CONTROLL!
<teentro> :S
<Wrek> 05specially this early in the whole "we are not aloge otu there" phase
<Wrek> 05heck
<Buytoast> she's gonna rip his heart out
<Wrek> 05the second NX class hip was barely half done when they left for the expanse
<Wrek> 05ship*
<TheMaster> Speaking of crossovers. Did you know they wanted to do a crossover ep of star trek with dr.who?
<teentro> well... its not my kind of a show... but with queen its getting interessting :D
<Tervicz> ooops
<Dark_Horst> kablooey
<Wrek> 05i didnt know that
<Wrek> 05sounded quite interesting
<pony1553> dem eye brows
<Tervicz> Trip doesn't know what went wrong
<Wrek> 05and im sure you are able to follow by right now they are tryign to synthesize their own trellium D
<TheMaster> so that they don't get wiped out by gravity?
<Dark_Horst> evil space hooker
<teentro> kiss her :|
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: more or less
<teentro> oooh :(
<TheMaster> is that a teleporter?
<Wrek> 05yep
<teentro> KISS her :D
<Wrek> 05the first experimental teleporter
<teentro> oh -.-
<Dark_Horst> inb4 she's a pheromone sprinkler
<Wrek> 05they didnt start using it untill season 2 though in emergency situations due to high scepticism
<Buytoast> oh my
<Buytoast> it's time
<pony1553> sexy time
<TheMaster> I would be skeptical too. Knowing how it functions.
<Wrek> 05aye
<TheMaster> she sort of looks like river song
<Dark_Horst> they once beamed someone up and he had leaves and branches stuck everywhere in him
<Dark_Horst> so this one doesnt use all those things like bio.buffers yet
<pony1553> they still have candles in the future
<TheMaster> they still have candles now. theres no reason they'd go away
<Dark_Horst> vulkan meditation
<TheMaster> >trying to mind control a vulcan
<TheMaster> goodluck
<Dark_Horst> i knew she was evil
<TheMaster> she needs to nerve pinch her
<TheMaster> like a reverse cylon, doing lighty things to your spine
<Buytoast> it's time to enter the prise
<Wrek> 05i never got into battlestar galactica, the new or the reboot
<TheMaster> You know what they should do? A HBO/TV series of the simarillion
<TheMaster> imagine how amazing that would be
<Wrek> 05a shame it seems like an interesting show
<Wrek> 05only been able to catch late night episodes on TV6
<Wrek> 05should i DL them or is it a waste of time
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: it'S interesting, but it's also stuffed with way too much drama
<TheMaster> I mostly watched the new one with my dad, who is a fan. It was alright but I dunno. Sci-fi has never been my particular fancy
<Wrek> 05adn yet here we are talkign about star treck :P
<Wrek> 05kÄ*
<TheMaster> But yeah. Lots of drama and the premise sort of gets drawn out
<Dark_Horst> star trekä. must be swedish
<TheMaster> "we're running from evil robots. they're trying to find us"
<Wrek> 05ive got that much :P
<Wrek> 05hehe ^_^
<TheMaster> Oh I like good sci-fi. But I prefer it when it doesn't take itself too seriously if that makes sense. Sci-fi series that try and ground themselves in 'realism' arn't as good in my opinion compared to the 'fun' sci-fi like original TNG or dr.who
<Dark_Horst> do the airlock trick!
<TheMaster> original star trek
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: yeah i think i get your point
<TheMaster> mostly because the writers seem to underestimate the size of the universe. It makes it seem silly that individual characters can have a impact in a story the size of a galaxy
<TheMaster> How did they ever reconcile the original series storylines with the more serious-tone of TNG and the later ones?
<TheMaster> I saw episodes where an entire planet was themed on 1930s gangster america
<TheMaster> which was awesome by the way
<Wrek> 05a projectile weapon would work against those guys rather easely
<Wrek> 05id keep a revolver with me
<TheMaster> projectile weapons work against most soft living things
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: didnt picard fight invaders on his ship with a crossbow once?
<Wrek> 05actually yes he did
<TheMaster> these guys are pretty well equiped
<Wrek> 05well they are the more millitant and agressive xindi
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! :)
<RainBowJack> hello every pony
<Jim> hi Ponies47
<Jim> hi RainBowJack
<alexxm> how you doing Ponies47
<Wrek> 05dat gland
<RainBowJack> its a Pinkie pie Gland
<Dark_Horst> shouldnt they also analyze the suit?
<RainBowJack> to much sugar
*Jmo4267 glomps Ponies47
*RainBowJack hugs Jim
<RainBowJack> did any pont see CCCP ?
<Ponies47> I'm good alexxm. How about you?

<Gamefreak324> NO MORE BHG
<Gamefreak324> YESSS
<Dark92Enigma> proceed!!!!!!!
<P4ngya> ack i hate the whole "humans are somehow better than other species" thing
<Dark92Enigma> YES
<Gamefreak324> everfree is playing it
<Gamefreak324> awesome
<Gamefreak324> cone!?!
<Wrek> 05good thing this one doesnt use that one then P4ngya
<Dark_Horst> cone
<alexxm> the cone of doom
<P4ngya> didn't you just hear what she said?
<Wrek> 05there are more to these than a bio scan can tell
<alexxm> the hells happening did they encounter face huggers
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT did she said?
<Riders> Well this is a pleasant surprise in the morning
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: what wrek said
<Dark92Enigma> OH
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<alexxm> so are they doing an aliens cross over
<Jmo4267> Hello Malavolent
<Wrek> 05i cant see how this implies that humasn are the better species
<alexxm> how you doing Malavolent
*Dark92Enigma That's what she said
<Malavolent> alexxm: It's freaking hot in here, other than that, I'm pretty good. How abou you?
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<Dark_Horst> she mad
<Dark92Enigma> Close enough, but it's not KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
<Dark92Enigma> Or CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
<MadSurge> :O Binding of Isaac's new final boss... is Isaac himself!
<TheMaster> okay. I've stayed away from the topic long enough. I've been very patient these last few months. But is there any word on season 3?
<MadSurge> TheMaster: there will be ponies
<P4ngya> ^it will exist, that's all i need to know
<Dark_Horst> somes aid it was supposed to start august, but that got elayed
<Wrek> 05it will exist
<Dark_Horst> *delayed
<Jmo4267> Amen P4ngya
<Wrek> 05it will air before the year ends
<Wrek> 05more than that
<Malavolent> It will contain ponies.
<Wrek> 05we acnt say here
<Wrek> 05casue it goes agaisnt the no spoiler rules
<TheMaster> I guess I'll have to look forward to Dexter
<MadSurge> Season 3 spoilers are a bannable offense
<Buytoast> it shall never come
<Riders> It'll only be 13 episodes from what I've heard
<Wrek> 05the latest season will air here in a week though
<Wrek> 05of dexter that is
<Zawan> oh dexter
<Wrek> 05you say only 13, i say "yay 13 more!"
<TheMaster> I think the 13 is meant to leave it open for more if it gets enough response
<TheMaster> and the hub/hasbro would have to be insane to nix it so quickly
<Malavolent> I think there will be 13 episodes and a movie.
<TheMaster> even if they're already at 18+ hours of content
<Riders> @Wreck = I don't mean that as a bad thing. I actually wouldn't mind seeing them scale it back
<Jmo4267> Dat Wreck
<TheMaster> no. More Ponies for the Pony god. More daw for the daw throne
<alexxm> they got tom
<Jmo4267> icwatwudidthar TheMaster
<TheMaster> It can't be that expensive to produce episodes
<Barbetos> space rocks yay!
<P4ngya> what are they looking for?
<Dark_Horst> why are they collecting asteroids
<TheMaster> its flash, very detailed flash, but still flash
<Dark_Horst> for the alloy?
<TheMaster> and the VAs can't cost that much
<Wrek> 05as ytou can see TheMaster, the already experimental transporter got screwed by gravitron distortions
<TheMaster> darn gravity.
<Thrackerzod> hello everyone
<Wrek> 05casue they need the base ore to make trelliuum D
<TheMaster> stupid all-constant and inescapeable force of the universe!
<Riders> Honestly if Season 3 goes out as strong as Season 2 more or less, I'm fine with it being the last season. I've seen way too many cartoons that I have loved more that would have killed for a 65 episode run
<Dark_Horst> oh look, they have a redshirt witht hem
<Dark_Horst> well, okay, not quite red but you knwo what i mean
<Jmo4267> Hey Thrackerzod
<P4ngya> gravity is basically the production of acceleration, right?
<Riders> I don't think there were redshirts in Enterprise
<TheMaster> I don't mind series getting run into the ground. Spongebob and simpson had seasons and seasons before they collapsed. Better to dare to greatness then to hold back and cut it off before you get all you can
<TheMaster> all you have to do is stop watching
<Thrackerzod> Riders or a anti-mattter real matter gen
<Dark_Horst> a noname military guy in the background? that guy is begging for death
<TheMaster> ensign ricky, take point
<RainBowJack> red shirts always die
<TheMaster> if i'm ever on a star ship I will loudly say my last name wherever I go.
<RainBowJack> I am JACK ASS here i cvome?
<TheMaster> helps to avoid being murdered
<Dark_Horst> the only thing that annoys me on this series is the perverse amount of bloom
<Wrek> 05i dont get it
<Dark_Horst> bloom, blur, whatever it is you call that optic filter
<TrixieMuffins> not really , nameless redshirts dieby the dozens to show that there is danger or whatever , named redshirts die gruesomely to motivate the main cast
<Dark_Horst> it was worst in the first season
<Dark_Horst> vulkan zombies. greta
<Dark_Horst> *great
<TheMaster> I guess the only way to not die is to get a important position in the ships hierarchy
<Wrek> 05red-shirt is doing well
<Wrek> 05he will live to die another day
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<RainBowJack1> is that pfhase gun set on stun?
<Jmo4267> Hey Bronysith
<Dark_Horst> he broke the system!
<Riders> He won't die. He's a helmsman
<Jim> hi Bronysith
<Barbetos> space zombies?
<Wrek> 05space zombies and pirates
<TrixieMuffins> so they only have stun and kill ? how about stun more ? why do theyexpect stun to work on everything ?
<TheMaster> atleast they're not turning into freaky tentacle monsters
<alexxm> the borg?
<TheMaster> the borg are not zombies
<Buytoast> where's smas arn when you need her
<P4ngya> they have tickle, they just never mention it
<Wrek> 05they also have th e slight cough setting
<Barbetos> Wrek and suddenly space ninjas
<Wrek> 05and the limb setting
<Barbetos> all played by ponies.
<TheMaster> this problem would be solved if they had a shotgun or a chainsaw
<Barbetos> I wonder what a vulcan pony would look like XD
<Wrek> 05no it would be solved it tpol had let them use kill isntead of stun
<RainBowJack1> did anyony see CCCP today?
<TrixieMuffins> if only they could set phasers to hug
<Wrek> 05nope not me
<Dark_Horst> TrixieMuffins: this is still pretty primitive tech in this series. only tng phasers have precise strenngth regulation
<TheMaster> they'd look like this http://cdn.walyou.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/07/Spock-Pony-e1341908055352.jpg
<Barbetos> lol
<P4ngya> i refuse to click on that
<Gamefreak324> alpha just told me that the program to get those desktop ponies
<Gamefreak324> costs like 600 bucks
<Barbetos> Huh. THey really are ninjas
<Gamefreak324> that true??
<Wrek> 05hes fucking with otu
<TheMaster> it costs 600 intenret dollars
<Wrek> 05you*
<Jim> Gamefreak324, It is free
<Gamefreak324> lol k
<alexxm> how did they miss that guy
<TheMaster> you'll have to make atleast 4 youtube videos to earn that much internet money
<Bronysith> these guys look like they are froma vault
<Gamefreak324> yay nother smoke break!
<TheMaster> uh oh. She let her emotions get out of control
<TrixieMuffins> your a bulkhead
<Bronysith> TrixieMuffins: *you're
<TheMaster> so a vulcans default state is a zombie?
<Wrek> 05hehe
<TheMaster> many the entire ship just went into pon-far or something
<TheMaster> maybe*
<Wrek> 05mhm
<sonicandmario85> website is offline? wtf?
<sonicandmario85> i hit retry now it works
<alexxm> he did nothing
<sonicandmario85> why do they store anti-matter its fucking dangerous if you touch it youll doom the whole universe XD
<Wrek> 05becasue it powers the engines
<Wrek> 05you do you keep rocket fuel in yoru rockets
<Wrek> 05if it can explode
<TheMaster> why do you breathe oxygen? its very flamable
<sonicandmario85> no it isnt every single human being on this earth breates it
<sonicandmario85> breathes*
<Rain> oh hello, Wrek ^_6
<Rain> ^_^
<Wrek> 05hai rain :D
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: oxigen is very flammab´le. you may ask any chemist
<Rain> how are you? ^_^
<Dark_Horst> *oxygen
<TheMaster> what does a fire need to work?
<sonicandmario85> if i didnt breathe i would die
<sonicandmario85> gas is the one very flamable
<Dark_Horst> oxygen is a gas
<Rain> learn how to breathe something less flamable
<Serenity> TheMaster: Air, fuel and something else
<Serenity> Heat
<Wrek> 05oxygen, fuel, heat
<Dark_Horst> we should all breathe helium. that one dowsnt blow up
<sonicandmario85> if its very flamable why do you breathe it? we cannot survive without air if we didnt need to breathe we wouldent have a fucking nose
<TheMaster> we breathe it because without the oxygen your muscles couldn't twitch or move
<Wrek> 05so you heart would stop
<Jmo4267> This conversation is making me chuckle.
<TheMaster> wood is flamable but they don't burst into flames just because they're flamable
<Wrek> 05being unable to supply your brain with fuel to work properly
<Wrek> 05so it would stop sending the signal to your ehart to pump
<Shooeie> What we watching?
<Wrek> 05henceforth death
<TheMaster> oxygen is flamable but lucky for us the atmosphere is only 7% oxygen
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: see? and the ship there wouldnt move without antimatter
<Chrysalis> TheMaster you dont seriously believe that do you?
<TheMaster> 21% my bad
<Zawan> Shooeie: star trek
<Wrek> 05its only 7% uhm
<Wrek> 05whatever you englis hspeakers call it
<Shooeie> Nice spelling there Wrek
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:actually i think theres actually lots of oxygen on this planet
<Jmo4267> You don't say sonicandmario85 >_>
<Shooeie> Why are we talking about oxygen percentage?
<TheMaster> and without the nitrogen plants wouldn't grow
<TheMaster> because science
<Wrek> 05Shooeie: he asked why they store antimatter if its so darn dangerous.
<Dark_Horst> Shooeie: becasue antimatter
<Wrek> 05it fuels the engines
<Rain> ^
<TheMaster> typically dangerous things make for good fuel
<Wrek> 05why does he breathe oxygen if its flammable
<Wrek> 05becasue it fuels his body
<Shooeie> Anti-matter is best matter
<Wrek> 05partially
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: actually, the engines are fuelled by the electricity from the matter/antimatter reaction in the warpcore
<TheMaster> because of how much energy is stored inside. energy, when uncontrolled, can lead to cool explosions
<Riders> God bless space explosions
<Dark_Horst> *nerd*
<Rain> antimatter makes a looooooot of energy when it is mixed with matter in a safe environment
<Wrek> 05Dark92Enigma: well its still a fuel
<Wrek> 05so you got me on a technicallity
<TheMaster> maybe a better question is. why do you put gas in your car if its so flamable?
<Dark_Horst> if i remmeber correctly, they use deuterium and anti hydrogen
<P4ngya> so that micheal bay has an excuse
<TheMaster> safe, inert things don't usually make a lot of energy when you burn them unfortunately.
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:it fuels the car
<Shooeie> Because we got nothing better to put in it
<TheMaster> well you could probably make a coal powered car if you wanted too
<TheMaster> They made coal powered ships after all
<Dark_Horst> we could make a hamster poweredcar
<TheMaster> but the stored hydrocarbons in coal arn't nearly as good as oil/gasoline
<RainBowJack> did anypony see CCCP ?
<TheMaster> I wonder how vulcan fashion works.
<Barbetos> RainBowJack not today.
<RainBowJack> i hope he comes on
<Dark_Horst> did you notice how she doesnt wear anything under that blanket?
<TheMaster> the camera sure did
<RainBowJack> he PMed me but i was on the little colts room
<Dark_Horst> oh god, phlox is THAT guy
<TheMaster> soap opera night on the enterprise?
<Rain> his face when
<Shooeie> I think its movie night
<Riders> Xindi!
<Dark_Horst> t'pol be trippin
<Dark_Horst> naw, they're just vulkan zombies
<P4ngya> fo reals
<Riders> Nevermind
<Chrysalis> its BMN far in the future
<Wrek> 05fuck me i want another episode
<RainBowJack> Wrek indeed
<P4ngya> i dont mind
<TheMaster> was that the last one?
<RainBowJack> NEXT
<Zanon> Zanon is back from his evil visit with the eyedoctor.
<Riders> I always thought Enterprise was a tad bit underrated
<Wrek> 05ohai
<Wrek> 05this episode is meh
<RainBowJack> Wrek s OC is painting Twilight
<sonicandmario85> we know xD
<Riders> It took 2 seasons for it to get good but when it was good, it was very good.
<Zanon> Naw hes painting rarity... we all know that.
<P4ngya> what was her name?
<Wrek> 05engsin sato
<TheMaster> maybe we'll have anti-matter stuff. The LHC seems to be doing some good stuff in switzerland
<TheMaster> how cool would that be?
<Wrek> 05or however you spell it
<Dark_Horst> ensign hoshi sato
<TheMaster> anti-matter soon*
<sonicandmario85> Zanon:is raritys skin purple?
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: aye im looking forward to see how antimatter takes us one step furtehr
<Wrek> 05too bad people consider it a weapon
<TheMaster> though I think at the moment they're just trying to figure out how the nuclear forces work
<TheMaster> which is cool too
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: just what i was about to say. we all know what happened when they discovered nuclear powe
<Dark_Horst> r
<TheMaster> like we need a new, bigger weapon
<P4ngya> Wrek: since when was it's existence proved?
<Chrysalis> Wrek they said the same thing about fussion
<TheMaster> fusion bombs are already ridiculous
<Riders> Well this has put me in a space opera mood. So long Bronies, I have Mass Effect multiplayer grinding to do
<Chrysalis> now ITER is getting built
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: they will always try and make a bigger weapon
<TheMaster> they've observed anti-matter I believe.
<sonicandmario85> bullets are for pussy anti matter ftw XD
<Shooeie> There is always a biggerfish, or in this case a bigger weapon
<Barbetos> HWG does not agree.
<Barbetos> HWG likes bullet
<TheMaster> Did they actually find the god particle? I don't recall whether they'd actually found the higgs-boson or were just getting close to saying for sure
<sonicandmario85> bullets are good but anti matter is best bullet that isnt really a bullet :3
<Barbetos> antimater sandvich is best sandvich?
<Dark_Horst> all i know is that afte that day, facebook and twitter were full of religious morons, claiming they had won the god debate becasue of higgs boson
<TheMaster> just because they called it the god particle doesn't mean it actually...
<sonicandmario85> Barbetos:no because it will probally kill you xD
<TheMaster> oh silly religious people
<Dark_Horst> dumb people. dumb people everywhere
<TheMaster> i'm glad hawkings turned out to be right
<TheMaster> no black holes wiping out earth
<TheMaster> it was super unlikely anyway.
<sonicandmario85> i hope im dead when the sun dies
<RainBowJack> earth?
<TheMaster> are you planning on living for hundreds of billions of years?
<Barbetos> Oh you probably will be
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: if God exist he doesn't care about us XD
<Wrek> 05earth is a fluke
<Wrek> 05but that doesnt mean we should find otehr flukes
<Wrek> 05shouldnt*
<TheMaster> I don't think its so much a fluke as.
<sonicandmario85> MadSurge:he does care about us i saw a ghost once and im not joking ghosts are very fucking real
<TheMaster> Consider how you wouldn't be questioning how unlucky it was that you didn't evolve on a planet that couldn't support life.
<Barbetos> We should make the other flukes
<MadSurge> sonicandmario85: O__o
<RainBowJack> its Q
<TheMaster> Q is off to an early start.
<alexxm> was Q in this series
<StormFox> is it Q? :3
<TheMaster> he must have got bored waiting for picard
<Dark_Horst> no
<sonicandmario85> it was the ghost of my dead cat he was sleeping on the couch and i looked at something and looked back he was gone
<Dark_Horst> no q here
<Barbetos> Hallucinations are fun.
<RainBowJack> well almost looked like Q
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, everyone
<sonicandmario85> and my mom felt him walking on her bed and looked and nothing was there
<TheMaster> if you consider how ridoncolously big the universe is it makes sense that their would be other planets with life on them.
<Barbetos> Morning AttacktheAndalite
<Dark_Horst> i actually could've sworn i saw my dead cat once too. corner of the eye stuff. so when it comes to ghosts, i decide to remain undecided
<TheMaster> the question is, how do we find or even get to them
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, Barbetos. How're you?
<Barbetos> working.
<Barbetos> How about you?
<Dark_Horst> i dont believe in ghosts, but i'm also not ruling out the possibility compeltely
<AttacktheAndalite> Eh....getting breakfast.
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:yea on NBC news last year nasa discoverd a life planet all coverd with water so theres probally some life living there
<Wrek> 05there is a difference between not believing in god or ghosts period.
<Barbetos> Wafflllessss
<TheMaster> you mean they found a planet that probably had water on it
<Wrek> 05and not beleiving in god or ghosts etc untill proven otherwise
<TheMaster> theres water on europa
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:no it all had water on it
<TheMaster> (which is a moon in...jupiters orbit)
*Underpony is back (gone 00:07:04)
<fluffle> might be an ocean under the ice
<TheMaster> Yes, I think you mean europa
<Wrek> 05and where there is water there is a chance for micro organisms
<sonicandmario85> IT WAS A DIFFRENT PLANET NOT JUPITERS FUCKING MOON
<sonicandmario85> god everyone knows about it
<Dark_Horst> sonicandmario85: calm your tits
<Wrek> 05oi sonicandmario85
<Wrek> 05no allcaps
<TheMaster> woah brah. Relax lul
<Barbetos> Europa - the futuristic Europe.
<sonicandmario85> Dark_Horst:i dont have tits so i cant calm them
<Dark_Horst> they also found a whole planet consisting completely of diamond
<Barbetos> Watch out of the space romans
<Wrek> 05also TheMaster.
<P4ngya> where did "calm your tits" come from anyway?
<Wrek> 05there is no federation yet
<Wrek> 05only star fleet
<Wrek> 05command
<TheMaster> oh okay. I thought that star fleet = the fedeartion
<Dark_Horst> it was one of those lucky images where a planet just happens to cross in front of it's sun jsut at the moment the photo was taken
<sonicandmario85> im not talking about europa it wasnt coverd in ice
<Chrysalis> later on star fleet is a part of the federation
<Dark_Horst> they did some spectrum alayzing magic on it and discovered that the planet consists of diamond
<Chrysalis> but they are not equivelant
<sonicandmario85> if it was europa it wouldent be on the fucking news
<Dark_Horst> pretty raw diamond, but still diamond#
<TheMaster> i think that europa having ice and water is pretty cool
<TheMaster> it happens to be close
<TheMaster> relatively close
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<sonicandmario85> guys they werent talking about europa
<Dark_Horst> who is crabhead there?
<Meanwhile> Ooh, Enterprise.
<Riders> Enterprise takes place long before the founding of the federation
<sonicandmario85> they were talking about a planet in another solar system with water on it
<Celes_Chere> Hey everypony, Pluto says Hi
<TheMaster> then thats cool too
<TheMaster> water seems to be something you sort of need to have life
<fluffle> He is after her booty
<Dark_Horst> Celes_Chere: pluto can go fuck itself
<TheMaster> though if you asked water bears they would tell you that they're unkillable super creatures
<TheMaster> who don't need water, air, food, sunlight or even not-a-vacuum to live
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:it also has visible clouds from space like earth does which means it probaly contains life welll life thats designed to be in the water that is..
<TheMaster> having a atmosphere is also important but I dunno if that means it has life on it
<alexxm> pizza
<Meanwhile> Crab head guy made you a pizza.
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:all a planet needs for life is air water and an atmosphere
<TheMaster> and even if it did, i'd be estatic if all you found was grass or the equivelent
<TheMaster> and time
<TheMaster> lots and lots and lots and lots of time
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:ever heard of cells? we wouldent have formed without them that doesnt mean other planets dont have them they are the building blocks of life
<TheMaster> and you actually need the right mixture of chemicals to somehow, someway form into repeating chains of biological RNA
<alexxm> stalker
<Meanwhile> Socially awkward crab-head.
<TheMaster> I wonder if he replicated spaghetti to fall out of his pockets
<StormFox> star trek version of phantom of the opera *ponyshrug*
<sonicandmario85> lets all shut up about planets and enjoy the fucking movie and think about ponies or whatever XD
<TheMaster> hey, it was just a friendly discussion mahn
<TheMaster> gotta relax

<Wrek> 05lololol
<Riders> looked like a volleyball
<TheMaster> I wonder what the repair bill for the enterprise is
<TheMaster> because it looks like the ship gets messed up every episode or so
<Meanwhile> How convienient that the ship happened to pulse and then rupture away from where people are.
<sonicandmario85> brb ima go get something to eat i just got up and i havent even had breakfast yet XD
<Meanwhile> Medieval Klingon. I bet that was a fun era.
<Dark_Horst> medieval klingons. oh god
<teentro> are we still watching startreck???
<Dark_Horst> we are
<Wrek> 05yeah isnt it great!?
<teentro> kk... :P
<Meanwhile> Personally I like Voyager or Next Gen, but Enterprise has it's moments.
<TheMaster> medeival klingons? Now I want to watch Hamlet in Klingon
<teentro> well... i never watched it and i wont start it now :D
<Meanwhile> TheMaster: Alas poor Yorick, I killed him Horatio.
<TheMaster> whether tis nobler in the mind to kill your enemies quickly, or kill them slowly.
<TheMaster> as popular as hamlet is I think the Klingons would enjoy the Henry plays more
<sonicandmario85> back
<Wrek> 05makes me want to vote shakespeare in love as movie
<Wrek> 05but cba to see it more than once

*VenHur LOVES Shakespeare, espectially Julliet and Romeo.
<Riders> Danger Zone!
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: Pizza in the morning? That's my kind of breakfast
<TheMaster> my favorite is a tie between Macbeth and Merchant of Venice

<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: All my envy.
<VenHur> I just went into the Random Zone.
<sonicandmario85> its leftover pizza i had last night
<sonicandmario85> pizza i didnt eat
<TheMaster> hey wrek. Do you have episodes of the twilight zone?
<Wrek> 05i had on my old media storage
<AttacktheAndalite> sonicandmario85: It's still pizza.
<sonicandmario85> NO! NOT TWILIGHT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!
<TheMaster> Twilight Zone

<Wrek> 05^

<Wrek> 05last warning
<Riders> She's putting him in the friend zone. He wants to put her in the rape zone
<Meanwhile> Alien-zoned.
<TheMaster> My favorite TZ ep is the obsolete librarian
<TheMaster> such a awesome ep
<MadSurge> Twilight Zone <3
<Wrek> 05xeno-zoned sounds better
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> TheMaster: an*
<VenHur> TheMaster: Love the original series, the 50s one, not the 1985/2002 revival.
<Meanwhile> Evening AttacktheAndalite.
<sonicandmario85> Wrek:i baked you a pie
<MadSurge> Hello Meanwhile and AttacktheAndalite!
<Meanwhile> Allo MadSurge.
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai MadSurge
<Wrek> 05sonicandmario85: how redundant seeing as you are probably multiple countries away
<Sumica> 00,10oh wrek is streaming enterprise now?
<Wrek> 05Sumica
<MadSurge> Sumica: yep
<Wrek> 05yeah i had to show the good part of it
<Wrek> 05isntead of the lousy season 1 and 2
<MadSurge> You mean season 3?
<sonicandmario85> Wrek:havent you seen asdfmovie? its a quote form it
<Sumica> 00,10good I can remove it then. =p
<sonicandmario85> from*
<TheMaster> I wonder if they're going to do more overt star-trek references in season 3
<Wrek> 05sonicandmario85: i know where you referenced from
<Wrek> 05but i have no intention of giving you the privilege of my aknowledgement
<TheMaster> They did starwars/triumph of the will references.
<Riders> As bad as the first 2 seasons were, I was always sad that ot got cancelled just as it was getting really good
<Riders> *it
<sonicandmario85> Guy 1: i baked you a pie Guy 2:Oh Boy What Flavor Guy 1:PIE FLAVOR!
<Wrek> 05we know sonicandmario85
<Jmo4267> Did you know spaces help?
<Jmo4267> :>
<Serenity> asdf is old and unfunny imo
<sonicandmario85> tomska made the 5th one last year..
<alexxm> oh god the cg
<TheMaster> swearing? In my star trek?
<Meanwhile> I liked asdf, before everyone and their grandma started quoting it.
<Serenity> Even the costumes are CGI
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Agreed
<MadSurge> My dad is the trekkie of the house, I've always been more about horror
<TheMaster> whats asdf?
<sonicandmario85> asdfmovie
<VenHur> Halo before Halo was Halo.
<MadSurge> ^
<sonicandmario85> TheMaster:search it on youtube
<TheMaster> so...counterstrike?
<Spectrum_Rush> whats this ?... do i spy some ST:Enterprise
<Wrek> 05you complain about the cg
<Wrek> 05yet its good for its time
<TheMaster> oh a youtube series
<Wrek> 05meh
<Spectrum_Rush> also morning everypony
<MadSurge> Wrek: aye
<VenHur> Oh my god, it's the Enterprise!
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: you spy correctly!
<VenHur> ...Don't tell me. We're watching Star Trek, arent we?
<Meanwhile> How can we answer that if you don't want to be told?
<pony1553> eeyup
<Wrek> 05why are you acting like its taboo VenHur? its not like we are watchign a girls cartoon about pastel ponies
<Serenity> Wrek: When was this made?
<fluffle> :'( crabman never got her in bed
<TheMaster> I bet hardcore trekkies are happy about mlp
<Meanwhile> Wrek do you have any Voyager eps?
<Spectrum_Rush> never knew you liked star trek Wrek
<TheMaster> now they're the 'in culture' fanbase
<Wrek> 05it premiered season 1 o 2001
<TheMaster> bronies, being the new trekkies
<VenHur> Oh my god, Wrek pinged me...my dream has been achieved.
<Riders> Serenity = 2001-2005
<Riders> It's a Trap
<Serenity> VenHur: Not that big of a deal :S
<TheMaster> I bet she wouldn't be so against it if the alien was hot
<Meanwhile> Too bad he looks like a seafood medley.
<VenHur> Just so you know, I'm a newbie fan of Star Trek, only seen the movies, ironic how the odd movies got the lowest box office successes.
<TheMaster> he should have just projected himself as being attractive from the get-go
<Wrek> 05VenHur: you still didnt answer my question
<Chrysalis> dat guy REALLY doesnt take rejection
<pony1553> (ಠಠ)
<pony1553> _
<Meanwhile> Nobody likes a creeper crab-head.
<Wrek> 05ಠ = wheelchair
<VenHur> Oh, sorry Wrek, I don't really know what's Taboo is though, some sort of fictional planet?
<Spectrum_Rush> -_(\
<Jmo4267> This is gonna be interesting.
<fluffle> Can you blame him we all want to keep a Japanese girl in our basement
<Meanwhile> 粘
<TheMaster> this guy is like a ugly version of the doctor. without a tardis
<TheMaster> maybe its a badend for the dr.
<Meanwhile> What does that equal.

<VenHur> Ohh, THAT Taboo...
<VenHur> ...Never heard about it until now.
<TheMaster> I think that gets to be the word of the day
<Sumica> 00,10also a boreing game.
<Jmo4267> So boreing
<Jmo4267> :>
<Meanwhile> Yeah, why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies? To hide something, probably.
<Spectrum_Rush> god i'm so tired i keep seeing the word Taboo as Dabo
<fluffle_puff> He is always going to be there when she sleeps
<pony1553> (ಠ_ಠ)(ಠ_ಠ)(ಠ_ಠ)
<Thrackerzod> wut
<VenHur> I joined on a Star Trek episode/10
<Riders> I kinda wish the next step of this franchise would be a new crew farther into the future. I love where Abrams went with the series but I really want it to be progressive and in television format again.
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Zug zug?
<Sumica> 00,10dvds eh?
<Wrek> 05mhmmm
<Dark92Enigma> OK, brb......gotta go to my house......
<TheMaster> but the abrams movies set them at the very beginning
<TheMaster> with the least technology. The enterprise got wrekced by a mining ship
<Jmo4267> Meanwhile: Dabu?
<Meanwhile> Jmo4267: Work work.
<Riders> Which is why I want to go back to the future
<Jmo4267> Meanwhile: Lok'tar
<Meanwhile> Jmo4267: Ogar.
<Spectrum_Rush> TheMaster: a mining ship that was significantly altered by re-engineered borg technology
<Chrysalis> best intro ever
<Jmo4267> I got nothin' else. d:
<TheMaster> wait what. When did they say that in the movie?
<Riders> The only TV fix I have for space opera now is Battle Star Galactica and everything from that franchise post final season has been pretty much shit
<VenHur> I don't know...the intro looks like the weakest of the franchise...
<VenHur> I doesn't even has a badass fanfare tune in it, just some singer...
<Spectrum_Rush> TheMaster: its in supplemental materials, but its considered canon by paramount
<VenHur> *it
<TheMaster> they just needed a less...sitcomy song
<Spectrum_Rush> and its ashame they had a more fitting song
<Wrek> 05http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s480x480/375592_392264840828773_1994818010_n.jpg
<TheMaster> huh. The ship didn't look much like it had borgy stuff on it
<Sumica> 00,10I whould sent you all the TNG and Voyager eps wrek.
<Meanwhile> Wrek: I remember that game.
<Wrek> 05i have the DVD boxes of those aswell
<MadSurge> "Life on the Enterprise", starring That Guy From Quantum Leap
<Riders> I love the intro. The optimistic and uplifting nature fits the placement of the series
<Wrek> 05heck i have the VHS collection of voyager
<TheMaster> that is elder-god level trolling
<Chrysalis> wrek that is both evil and awesome
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: can we assume you have every series season and movies?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Sumica> 00,10lol vhs
<MadSurge> Only the good ones? :D
<TheMaster> did Wrath of Khan ever get picked as a movie night?
<Spectrum_Rush> o rly? wathcha missing Wrek ?
<TheMaster> because that is easily one of the best movies i've ever seen, even outside of star trek
<Wrek> 05only TNG, voyager, DS9, and this one for the series. but i own all the movies
<Sumica> 00,10no trek has ever been voted or picked
<VenHur> Greetings, and welcome to Ask That Guy From Quantum Leap. (sorry, I just has to.)
<MadSurge> Sumica: I still have my old VHS around :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: ah so no TOS or TAS?
<Sumica> 00,10so do I
<Riders> The only movies worth watching in my opinion is Wrath of Khan, FIrst Contact, and 2009
<Sumica> 00,10I used it to record pony
<Meanwhile> Needs more Voyager.
<VenHur> Khaaaan!
<Wrek> 05first contact is my favorite star trek movie
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Wrek> 05but i didnt mind nemesis
<Wrek> 05even if people disliked it
<Sumica> 00,10first contact was good
<MadSurge> :D
<Riders> Nemesis was okay but I wouldn't have gone out of my way to see it
<Meanwhile> Is that the one that at one point involves Borg being shot with a tommy gun?
<Wrek> 05Spectrum_Rush: im afraid the abverations doesnt ring a bell, can you spell them out?
<VenHur> I only seen some Star Trek movie, and I'll tell you.
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: yus
<TheMaster> I'm very tempted to linkt ot he plinkett reviews
<Sumica> 00,10Voyager needed a movie
<Meanwhile> I like that one.
<Chrysalis> Sumica it did have a rather awesome ending
<VenHur> Now, the first one was a big hype when it first cames out, NOBODY would of expected a Star Trek movie, NOBODY.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: The Original series or The Animated series
<Wrek> 05yeah Sumica, the season 7 finale was more than i could have asked :P
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but just think of the ending if it got a movie
<Wrek> 05never owned the sets but i used to have some VHS tapes with episodes recorded on them
<Meanwhile> Voyager ended well imo.
<Wrek> 05true
<Riders> The only Star Trek finale that sucked I thought was sadly the finale to Enterprise
<VenHur> ...Altough the movie was...disapointing, there's not a lot of action (damn you Enterprise scene.), the characters looked sort of bland, etc.
<Spectrum_Rush> ah the good ol days of vhs to tv recording
<Sumica> 00,10oh this is enterprise after they got the Makos.
<Wrek> 05you mean TNG or this one?
<Riders> This series
<Riders> The TNG finale was excellent
<Wrek> 05well it ended in theory 3 seasons too fast
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Wrek> 05so the "ending" wanst the proper ending
<Riders> It wasn't their fault but it unfortunately is what it is
<VenHur> So Star Trek I: The Motion Picture was really bad, and Trekkies feared the next movie (II) was about to be even worse.
<SirGanjalf> hello everypony
<pony1553> bye, I`m going to watch Lotr
<P4ngya> (ಠwಠ)
<Jim|Laptop> hi SirGanjalf
<VenHur> Hello SirGanjalf.

<alexxm> so why are they breaking into random peoples homes
<Wrek> 05he's a xindi
<fluffle_puff> earth was attacked
<Meanwhile> Are xindi like the Dominion?
<Wrek> 05not really
<Wrek> 05so far we have learned very little about them
<Riders> Damn it Archer, this is how you interrogate. BatmanVoice = WHERE"S THE KIMOCITE!!!! *Punch*
<MadSurge> What's the % in BerryPunch for? Is it a bot?
<Meanwhile> Aye.
<MadSurge> Proper interrogation time :D
<Meanwhile> Apelike. Pfft.
<MadSurge> Eww organic ammo/components
<Sumica> 00,10it's Half OP
<Meanwhile> Oh so the Xindi are all from one planet.
<Meanwhile> But still different species.
<Wrek> 05mhm
<Wrek> 05imagine humans and neantherthals

<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: its as if he was designed by tetsuya nomura :S
<Lil_B> and hi VenHur :)
<Riders> If that logic works, he's a benevolent hero. If it backfires, he's a dumbass
<Lil_B> what are we watching?

<Lil_B> hi somepony_else :)
<Lil_B> I only ever watched the next generation and the few voyager episodes that had Q in them
<CrimsonPhoenix> What would be this?
<RainBowJack> Wrek do you have a Q episode from the next generation?
<Sumica> 00,10startrek, 400years before TNG

<MadSurge> Q mating? Ewwww
<Meanwhile> That episode is funny.
<Wrek> 051 episode left on this disc
<Wrek> 05and its appropriatley named twilight :D
<Wrek> 05xD
<Lil_B> MadSurge it funny, the Qs fight each other dressed like the soldiers from the civil war
<Rain> :p
<Meanwhile> Q Continuum civil war is best civil war.
<MadSurge> Ohai Rain! :)
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: ooh one of my favorites
<Lil_B> hi Rain :)
<Rain> dat Wrek taking a smoke break
<Shooeie> We watching Twilight

<MegaMoonShine> Dude...
<Lil_B> welll... happens... i guess
<MegaMoonShine> Oh shit! :O
<Spectrum_Rush> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
<Chrysalis> p-p-p-p-p-planet busted
<P4ngya> well that was...slightly disturbing to watch
<Sumica> 00,10this intro is faster then I recall
<Lil_B> death star ripoff...
<Adam> what we watching
<MegaMoonShine> Giant buckyball of death!
<Wrek> 05yeah after the 2nd season they made the itnro "hip"
<Wrek> 05thoguh i personally preffered the season 1 intro
<Sumica> 00,10guess they never changed it when I watched it on tv
<Riders> Adam = Star Trek Enterprise
<Meanwhile> Thing is if you know anything about Star Trek prior to this series it's not a particularly credible threat.
<Lil_B> for the "cewl" kidz?
<Adam> thanks Riders
<Michael> hai everypony, how you doing? :$
<MegaMoonShine> hai Michael :)
<Lil_B> hey Michael !
<Adam> never really watched Star Trek before
*Michael hugs MegaMoonShine Lil_B
<Wrek> 05actually a good episode
<Adam> all i know is KAHN
<alexxm> how you doing Michael
<Riders> I prefer the more upbeat tone of the season 3 and 4 intro
<Chrysalis> huh, delta radiation is high-energy electrons
<Michael> alexxm: good, you?
<alexxm> i'm good Michael
<Sumica> 00,10I am disapointed they never once did any calback humor to Quantium Leap
<Michael> seems like someone tried to enter this chat, with my name :|
<Riders> Oh shit, Captain Archer made a Quantum Leap
<Spectrum_Rush> T'pol with long hair... that is my fetish :3
<RainBowJack> i loved quantium leap
<Michael> lol, star trek?
<Wrek> 05lol, Michael? why are you here? lol
<Adam> that didnt feel good
<Michael> Wrek: what?
<Adam> anypony want some mtn dew?
<Wrek> 05sure ill have some
<Lil_B> Adam whyts mtn dew?
<Chrysalis> 20 degrees at warp speed?
<Adam> here you go nice and cold Wrek
<Wrek> 05neat
<Chrysalis> that would cause some SERIOUS latitudinal stress
<Wrek> 05well technically there is no "motioN" during warp speed
<Spectrum_Rush> if not tear the ship apart
<Wrek> 05not in the same matter
<Adam> Lil_B: its a soda drink
<Sumica> 00,10not much of a strcutral support if it just falls off
<Lil_B> Adam whyt doe it taste like?
<Wrek> 05its basically the warp bubble moving the sapce inside the ship to a destination
<Wrek> 05or am i wrong?
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: you would be...
<Spectrum_Rush> right
<Sumica> 00,10kinda wrek.
<Adam> Lil_B: i dont lemon and lime but not sour
<Adam> WHAT is that thing
<Wrek> 05well never bothered lookign it up
<Wrek> 05please explain
<Lil_B> Adam ok :/ maybe I'll find it somehwere around here
<Michael> dem scanners
<Sumica> 00,10warp is kinda like falling through space
<Adam> oh no not the Hippocampus oh god the humanity he needs brain surgery or something
<Michael> wtf
<Meanwhile> Inb4 he's given them that before.
<Wrek> 05so while turnign 20 degrees could effect the destination os stabilities
<Adam> i watched some 2005 Dr.Who lately
<RainBowJack> fusion drive with Anit-mater and matter colent
<Sumica> 00,10So basicly it gave him altimsers
<Wrek> 05i dont think it would cause andy hull stress
<Wrek> 05not in that matter atleast
<Adam> i need to find the older version though
<Meanwhile> Andy Hull is stressed.
<Meanwhile> He needs to relax more.
<Derpy_at_work> hai :3
<Michael> hai Derpy_at_work :p
<Wrek> 05Sumica: aye
<Crono_brony> Morning everypony! How are all of you?

<Adam> good Crono_brony
<Michael> hai Crono_brony i'm good :)
<Crono_brony> That's great to hear! ^ ^

<MegaMoonShine> Pretty good Crono_brony
<Sumica> 00,10fail crewman
<Crono_brony> That's great!
<Lil_B> Dat Hammer
<Wrek> 05killed by liberty
<Adam> a STICK ?
<Michael> dem enterprise :D
<MegaMoonShine> Kaboom
<Wrek> 05sumica
<Sumica> 00,10only disabled?
<Wrek> 05we should write that down
<Wrek> 05ocne gusn of icarus gets boarding
<Wrek> 05that would be a viable tactic
<Sumica> 00,10raming?
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<Meanwhile> Wrek: The first thing we should do is take you off the wheel.
<Sumica> 00,10we kinda did that the other night
<Wrek> 05well Meanwhile you gotta admit my driving isnt that bad
<Sumica> 00,10I used the tail harpoon and draged one enemy in to another
<Meanwhile> Flying into clipping issues is not a valid strategy!
<Wrek> 05when the lag and stuff isnt in the way
<Sumica> 00,10we already lost the match but we got 2 kills
<Meanwhile> I wonder how long before mortars get nerfed.
<Adam> how about they switched most of their power to the engine and warp generator thingy
<Michael> are you talking about BF3?
<MegaMoonShine> >.>
<Jmo4267> HAHAHA BF3.
<RainBowJack> bye bye everypony
<RainBowJack> be back later
<Michael> bye RainBowJack
<MegaMoonShine> Later RainBowJack :)
<alexxm> bye RainBowJack
<Jmo4267> Cya RainBowJack
<Sumica> 00,10they need both of those pylon things to make a stable warp field
<Chrysalis> humans go bye bye
<Adam> bye RainBowJack
<Spectrum_Rush> wh cant i hold all these feels
<Sumica> 00,10with out it the buble would hae parts of the ship movie at diffrent speeds.
<Otherness> i missed the first half of this episode, whats going on?
<Riders> In other words... THIS IS CETI ALPHA 5!!
<Spectrum_Rush> 5th planet of Ceti Alpha System? now where have we heard of that planet before :S
<Wrek> 05they are called gondola
<Wrek> 05;O
<Chrysalis> Sumica they can create one but at higher speeds, but it collapses under strain at higher speeds
<Adam> i have no idea what's going on im glad i changed my name dur Chitti Chitti Bang Bang because i would do it now anyway
<Wrek> 05well
<Chrysalis> hence why they could still high 1.7 with only one necelle
<Wrek> 05the term higher speeds doesnt really apply to warp
<Meanwhile> Live long and prosper.
<Adam> what is that
<Adam> thing
<Wrek> 05basically the time it takes for the warp bubble to transport the mass
<Adam> human?
<Wrek> 05not really speed
<Wrek> 05in the same manner as a car accelerates
<Meanwhile> Warp 9.975. Voyager's average cruising speed, if I recall.
<Lil_B> Warp is so yesterday, in Hipser galaxy we use Patanoster
<Wrek> 05becasue warp 10 would make you jump galaxies
<Sumica> 00,10they cant hold the speed for long
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile yup
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: or turn into a frog :S
<Wrek> 05hehe
<Wrek> 05did we ever get to know more about warp 10 beyond the TNG episode?
<Meanwhile> According to Star Trek physics, reaching warp 10 means you will occupy every point in the universe simulaneously.
<Sumica> 00,10Voyager had it
<Chrysalis> though they do create 2 alternative forms, the quantum slipstream, and the delta-flyers (cant remember the name) one which hits warp 10
<Sumica> 00,10but then voyager puled out transwarp
<Chrysalis> Wrek yes, the delta flyer hits warp 10
<Wrek> 05well yeah
<Chrysalis> and then goes all creepy looking
<Spectrum_Rush> Chrysalis: Quantom Slipstream?... that sounds like an STO referance
<Lil_B> oh, hi Chrysalis
<Sumica> 00,10STO takes place after Voyager
<Adam> what is going on im confused
<Meanwhile> Quantum slipstream was in Voyager.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: about 30 years after nemesis
<[Alpha]> boo
<ponibas> STO takes place at like star date almost 1000000
<Wrek> 05been a while since i viewed all of voyager
<Wrek> 05i recall an ordeal about omega particles/space/etc
<Lil_B> Adam I think the capitain looses his memory every few hours or so... can't follow it myself though :/
<Wrek> 05what was that about?
<Meanwhile> Wrek: The Omega Directive.
<ponibas> i'd have to laod it up to check, but yeah. its after anything thats been shown on tvb
<Spectrum_Rush> i need to watch voyager again, can't remember half thia stuff
<Chrysalis> the borg have the Transwarp thing as well, though they do have reletivety issues
<Adam> thank Lil_B at least im not alone
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: they were super powerful and unstable and could probably destroy the univers or something like that
<Adam> lol
<Wrek> 05yeah i recall something simmilar
<Meanwhile> The Omega particle, a molecule with incredibly high energy output and instability was detected in the Delta Quadrant and according to Star Fleet orders Voyager moved to intercept and destroy.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Meanwhile> Omega molecules destroy subspace when they explode, a large enough concentration could completely stop warp travel within a quadrant sized area of space.
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile 7 of 9 also creates a chamber to stabilise the molecule
<Adam> is this a movie episode special or what?
<Wrek> 05no
<Meanwhile> Indeed, because Omega represents the Borg ideal of perfection in it's complexity.
<Wrek> 05all episodes are 40 minutes
<Vordox> I found a song that Gigabit MUSt love. <3
<Adam> thanks Wrek
<Vordox> Sting - Shape of My Heart Just found this classic.
<Michael> wow dat is a long episodes
<Lil_B> hi Vordox :)
<Michael> hai Vordox
<Vordox> Hi Lil_B =3 How's spriting?
<Vordox> Yo Michael
<Meanwhile> Omega, the Borg holy grail.
<Adam> wow i just realized movie night is on my Birthday
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile well it is there representation of perfection
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: You mean like I said in my last comment? :P
<Lil_B> Vordox the SB64 Sprite now finished, he likes the version i showed him
<Chrysalis> so much omega talk
<Wrek> 05thanks for the refresher
<Chrysalis> we completely ignored the protocol :P
<[Alpha]> omega?
<Vordox> Lil_B: Already animate out? Nice!
<Michael> what ep is this?
<Lil_B> Vordox no, no animation, only the sprite
<Meanwhile> First rule of Omega club, don't talk about Omega club.
<Vordox> Oh
<Vordox> Lil_B: Show me!
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: ya already broke the rule then
<Wrek> 05this is S3EP8
<Michael> thanks
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Irrelevant.
<Spectrum_Rush> :P
<Wrek> 05out of 224
<Wrek> 0524*
<Meanwhile> S3EP224. That's a long season.
<Chrysalis> around the sun?
<Chrysalis> time for time travel
<Chrysalis> warpdrive + sun slingshot = time travel
<Adam> i dont mind 40 minute episodes i watch breaking bad and doctor who all the time its just the story that i dont understand
<Spectrum_Rush> this isn't a voyage home
<Adam> ow the hippocampus
<Wrek> 05dat goatee is awesome
<Spectrum_Rush> dat it is Wrek
<Michael> dem lazors
<Meanwhile> Man they're pretty aggressive.
<Spectrum_Rush> Phasors
<Spectrum_Rush> well when you are the only defense for the last 6,000 humans Meanwhile , ya tend to be
<Sumica> 00,10She tells him every day and shows him once every 7 years
<MadSurge> PEW PEW PEW time
<Adam> she has pointy ears
<Wrek> 05dat pon far reference
<Chrysalis> Sumica dat canon knowledge of vulcan mating rituals
<Sumica> 00,10heh

*Rain cant handle that guy's chin...
<Adam> WHAT IS THAT
*Rain just wants to pick that little thing off
<Sumica> 00,10rage
<Wrek> 05rain doesnt like goatees? :o
<Rain> Wrek, no the vulcan
<Wrek> 05ah
<Meanwhile> Bloody temporal parasites.
<Rain> his chin has that weird little thing and alsfnv;asdnc I just want to pick at it ><
<Spectrum_Rush> Rain: only the girl in red is vulcan
<P4ngya> this is trippy as hell
<Rain> >_>
<Rain> alright then the face growth guy
<Rain> happy?
<Sumica> 00,10where these eps are good, I just never liked the it never happend things
*Rain at least tried
<Meanwhile> A for effort Rain.
<Vordox> WAIT
<Vordox> WHo was streaming Leon the Proffesional BEFORE?!
<Vordox> WHO!?
<Chrysalis> heres the thing, if they already removed some of the parasites
<Wrek> 05dat sentence confused me sumi
<Spectrum_Rush> do you mean Dr. Phlox a Danobulan
<Sumica> 00,10this is like the "year of hell" ep of voyager
<Chrysalis> wouldnt that at least make him a LITTLE better
<Michael> yay fight :D
<Chrysalis> giving them a better chance overall
<Vordox> Was it you Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10this ep wrek. it never happend
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Oh you mean the episodes where temporal flimflam makes the whole thing redundant?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Chrysalis> god year of hell
<Wrek> 05oh now i get it
<Meanwhile> I hated those too.
<Spectrum_Rush> what Meanwhile said Rain
<Chrysalis> i always feel bad for the crew in those eps
<Meanwhile> Wibbley wobbley timey wimey.
<Jim> So, my cat brought in this fella http://i.imgur.com/9vPED.jpg
<MadSurge> Sumica: my dad is watching Voyager right now
<Rain> Spectrum_Rush, what?
<Meanwhile> Jim: Aww, birdy.
<Serenity> Jim: lolwut
<Michael> dat leadership
<Adam> KAHN! is that coming up soon
<Vordox> Noone here loved Leon? D:
<MadSurge> Jim: awww mean kitty :(
<Chrysalis> they really DONT like that right necelle
<Chrysalis> thats the same one they lost earlier
<Wrek> 05aye
<MegaMoonShine> OH SHIT :O
<Adam> well theyre dead
<MadSurge> DED
<Meanwhile> Nobody likes necelles in Star Trek.
<Spectrum_Rush> Rain: A for effort, is all, don't mind me i'm just a nerd
<Chrysalis> if i recall its also the one voyagers takes alot of damage to
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile of course, they lose warp drive
<Michael> :O
<Meanwhile> Exacta.
<Michael> omg
<MegaMoonShine> Nooooooooooo!!
<MadSurge> SHOOT THEM
<Sumica> 00,10and that is why you dont put the bloody bridge on top
<alexxm> well that can't be good
<Serenity> Well, looks like the voyager is aout to get molested and destroyed
<stallion1> wow people, its been too long
<Serenity> Not sure about the molested bit, buy mrh
<Wrek> 05that isnt the voyager
<Wrek> 05,,,
<Jim> It was still alive when I took the picture, but the bird passed away only a few minutes later.
<Wrek> 05...
<MadSurge> Ohai stallion1
<alexxm> ded
<Chrysalis> Sumica they do build ships later on with a reserve bridge
<Michael> hai stallion1
<MegaMoonShine> Hello stallion1 :)
<Serenity> Wrek: (Isn't really a star trek fan, let me get things wrong in piece, okay)
<Chrysalis> and seperation capabilities
<Chrysalis> do they do learn
<Chrysalis> but a LONG time from now
<MadSurge> Jim: :'(
<Serenity> And I can hardly type rom this proportional angle
<Meanwhile> We've lost the port necelle we're venting plasma the shields are down there's a hull breach from decks 1 to 7 our phasers are overloading the torpedo tubes are locked up and the microwave is broke.
<Spectrum_Rush> Chrysalis: only 1 hundred years :S
<Sumica> 00,10back up bridges. are pointless if the primary crew just got spaced
<Wrek> 05i dont blame ya
<Meanwhile> And now the damage report machine is damaged.
<Chrysalis> Sumica ECH
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: dat arson murder and jaywalking
<Michael> abandon ship?
<stallion1> whats up! awesome peoples, b ut ill only be here for a few, but do not fret. I will be getting a laptop soon soooo bo-yea
<Adam> sneak attack critical for extra damage
<Sumica> 00,10put primary bridge in the center of the hull and you dont have the problem of it ggeting cut open
<Chrysalis> buyt then how do you get the "hole in the bridge ramming speed" shots
<Meanwhile> ^
<Chrysalis> like where janeway destroys the time ship
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: "Time's...up."
<Sumica> 00,10this is just a hey we can put clips of every one dieing in the advertisment and realy get alot of people watching
<Spectrum_Rush> or when Picard rams the enterprise into the scimitar
<Chrysalis> everyone else takes 1 shot to die
<Wrek> 05USS Defiant is best federation vessel
<Chrysalis> archer takes 3
<Michael> nuuuuu
<MegaMoonShine> He ded
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: in a mirror darkly?
<Wrek> 05hehe
<Adam> WHATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Meanwhile back in time...
<alexxm> boom
<Chrysalis> inb4 he remembers the future
<Michael> wtf just happened?
<Riders> Before newcomers get up in arms, It was not all just a dream
<Sumica> 00,10TV trope: it was all just a dream
<Adam> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED was he sleeping or what
<Chrysalis> Sumica this wasnt a dream, its an alternate timeline
<MegaMoonShine> But it never happened, so how would he remember it?
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: wait the onr from Ds9 or from the original series?
<Meanwhile> He had temporal parasites in his brain.
<Sumica> 00,10was it?
<Meanwhile> Because of their existence that stuff all happened.
<Adam> lol
<P4ngya> they destroyed something that doesn't follow the rules of time
<Wrek> 05well i was first reffereing the DS9 one
<Adam> YOWCH
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Wrek> 05but then you mentioned it so xD
<Meanwhile> But when they were destroyed they became non-existent and so having never existed that stuff never happened.
<Riders> The Parasites were displaced in time. Archer finished the removal procedure in the future, which destroyed them in the past, meaning the timeline has now diverged
<MegaMoonShine> Hai Everlasting_Joy :)
<Spectrum_Rush> ah XD
<Michael> hai Everlasting_Joy :)
<Meanwhile> Allo Everlasting_Joy.
<kenponchi> ello
<Jmo4267> Hey Everlasting_Joy
<MadSurge> Ohai Everlasting_Joy!
<alexxm> how you doing Everlasting_Joy
<Spectrum_Rush> good morrow Everlasting_Joy
<Michael> hai kenponchi
<Adam> well that episode MADE NO SENSE
<Everlasting_Joy> All dem pings :).
<Meanwhile> Made perfect sense.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Chrysalis> Adam temporal mechanics
<P4ngya> made sense to me :)
<Chrysalis> do you get them
<alexxm> the hell happened in that episode
<kenponchi> what just ended?
<Chrysalis> watch enough startrek
<Riders> Adam = don't see what was so hard to follow about it
<Chrysalis> and you will
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MegaMoonShine, Michael, Jmo4267, MadSurge, Spectrum_Rush!
<Adam> Riders: like was it a dream real or what
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: I'm doing fine. There's nothing I can really say that's of great significance.
<MadSurge> :D
<ponibas> lol, what a shock wrek would sho that :p
<Riders> Adam = The Parasites were displaced in time. Archer finished the removal procedure in the future, which destroyed them in the past, meaning the timeline has now diverged
<Chrysalis> suddenly
<Chrysalis> ponies :D
<Wrek> 05well that was fun

<Vordox> Lil_B: Woot?
<Cypresswolf> Why can't you believe? You're talking to a flying horse!
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Or a G1/G4 movie
<Kandarihu> If S3 is really going to be 13 episodes, that would be the only justification.
<JESmith71> If Megan showed up in G4, this would probably happen: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/212/1/d/megan_is_back_by_niban_destikim-d598z68.jpg
<Hat> I believe in magic

<Straisin> darkneesssss
<killerpony7733> Vordox: The other G's has comical effect for me honestly it's funny to watch something that bad
<Thrackerzod> Hey its Sven

<Vordox> Grab'd
<Invi> [Alpha] spike not :3
<VenHur> If Scorpan killed the original Applejack, chance's are you'll cause a time paradox in Equestria!
<Kandarihu> Keep in mind that most of the elements of G1 belong to Marvel. All that we can be sure of that didn't are Applejack and Spike.
<Lil_B> they look like Zelda Moblins
<Vordox> FOOOOR KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
<AttacktheAndalite> I wonder what Applejack's gonna tell Applebloom

<VenHur> rabidsonic220: Now the real question is, imagine THIS as the season 3 premiere episode, minus the mushroom village, the humans, etc.

<Kencolt> Star Trek Fandom. I was THERE... for the original broadcast. Pre net. Pre intyerweb. When fanzines were PHYSICAL. Old times.
<Kandarihu> Hat, all the popular shows. Frankly, I doubt there would be much of a chance that Dennou Coil would get streamed on here. But that's one of those underrated anime.
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda wonder what older gen collecters think about bronys
<ponibas> mohawk! the mohawk!
<Vordox> Kencolt: Yeah but MLP had HOW many viewings compared to Star Trek? =P

<pony_467145> A character should be judged on how much they contribute to the various stories they are in. Ed just sits at her computer and...acts "kawaii" or whatever. not a very interisting character.

<Big> most silly way to die ever
<Vordox> You decide
<Shooeie> WTF?
<Lil_B> Flyboy yeah, this scene is really hard with the mind of a child thing
<Dken2021> AttacktheAndalite he still has childhood innocence
<sagas> that was retarded
<Wasson> I told you it's a terrible episode.
<MadSurge> Big: Kinda :D
<Flyboy> Vordox: basically the death of a baby
<Star_Shadow> and this is why i hate clowns
<Obsidian> dats messed up
<Flyboy> he had to make the comment...
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Uuuh i got two colors blue and green. My LEFT is fully blue and my RIGHT is green with a tint of blue in the corner of my eye towards my nose.
<sagas> poor guy
<EpicCookieTime> He hates abusement parks??
<XylemTube> I forget this show's name
<Spectrum_Rush> what a funny and heartwarming episode eh sumi :S
<twilight_sprinkle> and thats how equestria was made
<XylemTube> what was it?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: My eyes are bucked up too :P
<Sumica> 00,10ikr
<Dken2021> XylemTube Cowboy Bebop

<Michael> what now?
<Star_Shadow> G1?
<pony1553> nomnomnom hotdog
<Sumica> 00,10I can speak every language but greek, but it's all greek to me.
<Wasson> heh
<Big> with exceptions like this episode this show will mess with your mind
<EpicCookieTime> Ching chenk blah blah blah xD
<Flyboy> this episode reminds me of rainbow factory. the last person you thought you would feel sorry for, you suddenly do. in this case. the man with a childs mind. in rainbow factory's case, rainbow dash.
<Dken2021> I love the first episdoe
<killerpony7733> Vordox: I wouldn't call the condition bucked up. It's a mutation yes but it usually results in a unique pattern in your eyes and only unique to you. It's more or less a lucky thing to have
<Wasson> naww, it's pretty grounded.
<Shooeie> Sumi bet you cant speak Latin
<Wasson> there is minimal mind-fuckery.
<Vordox> killerpony7733: O.o
<Wasson> it isn't anything stupid like "paranoia agent" or "boogie-pop Phantom"....so bad. so so bad.
<EpicCookieTime> Yay!!!
<Big> which is better trigun or cowboy bebop i feel like trigun for me
<Sumica> 00,10now for some space truckers
<Michael> cowboy bebop, again?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: But... Every colour except brown and it's colours(This includes Red)
<Vordox> killerpony7733: And yes, my eyes have "weird strings" in them
<EpicCookieTime> The intro is pretty confusing
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Aaaah. I see again i'm just speaking for myself here.
<Michael> later everypony, gotta go dinner :D
<Waffles> yes!<
<Flyboy> bye Michael
<Obsidian> Bye Michael
<EpicCookieTime> When does this series end anyway?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: No I mean...
<Wasson> I remember when my friend bought "Boogie-Pop Phantom" years ago...it was so hard convincing him that it was garbage.
<Flyboy> the music in the intro reminds me of TF2
<Vordox> killerpony7733: It's like a flower petal type of strings around my pupil
<Big> i like that every episode of cowboy bebop has a differnet genre of music. like jazz for one then rock
<alexxm> whats boogie pop phantom
<Shamroc> woo the heavy metal one~
<Vordox> What kind of condition is that, killerpony7733 ? O:o
<EpicCookieTime> No,Heavy weapons guy.
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Oh and don't misunderstand, what I meant it has every colour = It's the mix of that colour
<EpicCookieTime> :O :O :O
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Heck if i know. Never heard of the pattern or what
<Wasson> I'm not sure myself. Pointless unentertaining anime that tries way too hard...
<Big> YEAH QUEEN my favorite band
<Buytoast> ah yes, the truck one
<[Alpha]> :S

<Dark_Horst> when in doubt, crank up the metal
<Wasson> hell ya
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: That's terrible. :<
<Critchley> whats this anime?
<Wasson> Train of Concequences. ever heard that song?
<Vordox> WTF
<Vordox> SPIKE YOU CRAZY BASTARD
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: D:
<[Alpha]> That doesn't work in reality but who cares?
<Vordox> That's not how VACUUM WORKS
<Buytoast> the rovers will never know peace from their endless wandering, forever praying for a death that will never embrace them
<RaveBrony> Nuuuuu
<Vordox> TrAJECTORY Non ravity
<Vordox> Gravity*
<Wasson> if you do stuff fast enough, you might survive the low pressure.
<Dark_Horst> i really doubt he would be concious long enough for that
<pony1553> Mmmmm crispy ham
<Dark_Horst> or have eyes
<Vordox> Wasson: I thnk it's 20-30 seconds :P
<flutter_spin> http://xkcd.com/1086/ He wishes for a pony ^^
<Dark_Horst> hitchhikers guide says 35
<Dark_Horst> i never beleived that
<Wasson> yeah roughly...I wonder if your acclamated to a lower pressure environment if could help you cope..?
<otakon> hiya guys
<Vordox> Wife gonna truck
<Dark_Horst> but survivable is not the same as unharmed
<otakon> dat cat
<otakon> is fat
<Wasson> I think you can be concience for like 15 seconds...then you pass out. If you get back into a pressurized environment within a minute, you'll be okay.
<otakon> oh yeah space exposure?
<Vordox> Wasson: Lawl, space exposure?
<Vordox> Space is not a material
<Vordox> :P
<otakon> that's what happens in no atmosphere at absolute zero
<Vordox> That was for otakon
<otakon> what do you mean?
<otakon> you are exposed in space
<otakon> thus space exposure
<Wasson> it does take some time for the gasses to boil-out of your blood.
<Vordox> It's a technicality I'm laughing at otakon
<otakon> -__-
<otakon> welp anyway I might miss movie night tonight
<Vordox> It's like saying Space is something when it's not :P
<Wasson> when they were testing space suits for the moon landing, there was an incidnet in a vacuume chamger where a dude passed out.
<Wrek> 05what is Meanwhile doign on mars!?
<otakon> my mom might call me up to the bar to help her out with the work.
<Vordox> Wasson: I remember that
<String_Shredder> Wrek: His moustache led him there
<Big> he is braking the fourth wall
<otakon> Waltz For Venus is ;_;
<Big> screw spelling
<Vordox> So Mica...
<RustyMeat> what trilogie is this week?
<Vordox> Mica Trigun
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5a619f
<Wasson> antoher good ep*
<Vordox> Thank you! =3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Celestia Ponytailed
<flutter_spin> Trigun?
<Big> yes trigun
<otakon> oh look Trigun!
<Wrek> 05i sure love me some longcoats
<otakon> which REALLY needs a touch up
<CriticKitten> Hey look, it's me.
<CriticKitten> HAI ME
<flutter_spin> Trigun was one of those series that was awesome/funny/awesome/repeat
<Vordox> Wrek: Keep practicing drawing it.
<Big> best opening
<otakon> the age shows in the animation greatly
<Brony> Hi everypony
<otakon> hiya Brony
<Vordox> otakon: DO NOT TOUCH TRIGUN
<Vordox> EVER
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Brony
<Wasson> you can tell so much influence in Trigun from the director havig become Christan before making it.
<Vordox> Let the OLD relics of masterpieces of the past BE
<otakon> Vordox: it needs BR treatment
<otakon> Vordox: HD remaster
<Vordox> Oh
<Wasson> all the love and peace stuff.
<Vordox> That's fine then :P
<Vordox> No 3D though please
<Obsidian> Hey, what movies are tonight?
<Ryunosuke> is this ep.. 5(?)
<otakon> Vordox: no 3D, just touch ups
<otakon> Obsidian: it's Indiana Jones and....
<otakon> I'm not sure
<Vordox> So Sumica: since you like Trigin, have you seen the FULL Story of the manga or only the shortcoming of he anime?
<Ryunosuke> yup
<Sumica> 00,10I dont know I would like to see trigun come out like redline
<otakon> It's a me! Mario!
<Brony> :D
<Big> whats a yar?
<otakon> that's a lot of graves
<Ryunosuke> not this episode, the next one is kickass (I think) the one with the brothers
<Wasson> the thing that bugs me about Trigun is the...inherent goofiness of alot of the "enemies".
<otakon> yay milly!
<flutter_spin> not her again
<sagas> wow how old is this anime?
<Vordox> otakon: Milly = The tall girl?
<sagas> looks old
<otakon> Vordox: eeyup
<Michael> hai, i'm back :)
<Wasson> I mean, would it really have been so hard to make them a little less "comic book"
