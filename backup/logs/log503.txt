<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: seriously. "oh, the end to an amzing series that entertained gamers vor a decade with a simple basic recipe? let's fuck it up with a gameplay-experiment and throw all the answers we promised into the trash"
<otakon> alexxm: your posts are going in twice
<Lil_B|LMMS> wow, I'm finally done with This day Aria, now I only need to get the right and left hand in sync at the end and then I can try to make a remix of the song :D... but not today ;)

<otakon> ah
<otakon> Dark_Horst: I was dissappointed when the FPS hybrid in that vein was canceled. It looked interesting
<killerpony7733> Wrek one orgasmic song for me is the C&C RA2 intro theme

<Dark_Horst> otakon: that thing titled "Tiberium"? indeed a tragic fate. seriosuly, when i saw the screenshot of that soldier with the titan behind him, i was so hyped, i totally flipped my shit
<otakon> Dark_Horst: well, I didn't flip my shit but it did look interesting.

<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: ive been a big fan of the series since i was young... apocalypse was my favorite, though i was poorly disappointed in interceptor... i love space sims
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: I'm honestly interested in the original, got the WHOLE collection for 5 bucks but goddammit I can't get the hang of the controls

<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: lol, yeah i havent bought the pack on steam yet... but i have a game that is just as good as the original, UFO Extraterrestrial... its bloody brilliant
<alexxm> |Discord| sorry my compeutor doesn't like deaviant art
<Dark_Horst> one of may favourite tracks
<Panda-> alexxm: not much... just planning alot :D
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: yeah I've heard
<killerpony7733> Wrek ever tried a mass conscript assault with RA2? i remember being able to overrun a whole base with them they were pure rape trains though air could get them which is why you bring flak with them
<alexxm> what are you planning for Panda-
<Depressing_Rain> Herobrine and I are watching you don't turn your back
<Panda-> alexxm: oh... well... just a voice acting thingy xd
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: its kinda like the 'what if' game of the xcom universe... like what if the aliens had taken over earth in the first game instead of you fighting them off
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: ah, where can I get it?
<Wrek> 05full conscript rape traisn has been a reliable strategy during WW2 aswell so xD
<Wrek> 05should work in game too :P
<RainbowJack> Panda- : voice acting for what?
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: its on steam
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: danke
<MysteryPony> Cake is best pony!
<Depressing_Rain> mmmmmmm friendchips
<Kammerjunk> Like fire, hellfire, this fire in my skin.
<Panda-> RainbowJack: >.> nada xD
<RainbowJack> Panda- : aahh
<killerpony7733> Wrek yup i always have a huge grin on my face when swarming a enemy base with them they just send a trillion bullets through a base :D
<drfsupercenter> 03http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/job-fails-now-these-ads-i-can-live-with.jpg
<Panda-> RainbowJack: when im done.. ill show you :D
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: oh the version on steam is the Gold edition, it comes with a built in mod pack that can make the game more playable for people that arent accustomed to that style of game... or you can make it more difficult if your a masochist...
<CCCP> ugh this food im eating is crappy :(
<RainbowJack> Panda- : okay
<killerpony7733> CCCP what are you eating?
*Barbetos slaps the crapy food out of CCCP's hand "NO!"
<AlienEd27> Anypony up to play a game?
<Depressing_Rain> what game
<CCCP> killerpony7733: some salad thing
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: wait, isn't it already a "Rocks fall, everyone dies" kind of game fro the start?
<CCCP> Barbetos: :D
<Michael> i love salad
<killerpony7733> RA3 was still better then C&C 4 not RA2 but still a middle one between C&C 4 and RA2
<Depressing_Rain> wrek that said red alert 3
<CCCP> but its really bad salad
<Wrek> 05Depressing_Rain: but i said i love RA2
<Depressing_Rain> ah i see
*MysteryPony hugs Depressing_Rain!
<AlienEd27> well, i guess not. of to singleplayer with me.
<Depressing_Rain> i forgot what slash i use for the \me thing
<killerpony7733> AlienEd27 what games do you have?
<|Discord|> / use this one
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: yeah, but you can make it so your people and the aliens can take either less damage, or more... gain more experience from killing aliens, or less... the mod pack is actually really useful as it helps alot, the unmodded game is apparently ridiculously unforgiving...
<Depressing_Rain> ok
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: nice
*Depressing_Rain hugs MysteryPony
<Barbetos> Midnight_Tempest what game is this?
<killerpony7733> Wrek got some DX1 music?
*Depressing_Rain is on fire
<Midnight_Tempest> Barbetos: UFO Extraterrestrials
<AlienEd27> Killerpony7733 i have Minecraft, Terraria, magicka, TF2 (of course), Portal 2 and more
<Wrek> 05now playign tiberian sun music
<Midnight_Tempest> Barbetos: its kinda the spiritual successor to XCOM UFO Defence
<AlienEd27> so many games to browse trough 6_9
<killerpony7733> AlienEd27 Hm minecraft runs really bad and idunno about the others sorry :(
<AlienEd27> Killerpony7733 it's okay :)
<Barbetos> Midnight_Tempest: Yeah... I have not played either, but don't yell at me I already get enough of it from my coworker who played it XD
<MysteryPony> does anybody want a finger ring?
<Yokupony|Bananas> :3
<Michael> me
<killerpony7733> AlienEd27 if you want it to ping me just don't make the k a capital K
<killerpony7733> :D
*MysteryPony gives Michael a Finger Ring!
<Midnight_Tempest> Barbetos: well, its not a style of game for everyone... it takes alot of patience and time, being turn based and very, very tactical
<AlienEd27> killerpony7733 hehe, i'll remember that :D
*Michael puts the ring on his finger
<Barbetos> Midnight_Tempest sounds like the kind of wet dreams I have.
<killerpony7733> Wrek do you have Deus ex 1 music? :$
<Barbetos> I mean cream dreams. =P

<Om> I hope gillysuit feels better tomorrow
<Bronysith> Sumica: do you want the TARDIS or the millenium falcon?
<Midnight_Tempest> is there really a need to choose Bronysith... tardis is best space craft
<FairysHuff> So "Love you all. Bye." ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10Tardis, has more use
<Bronysith> Midnight_Tempest: well yea tardis is best
<Sylandest1> Om: same here. gil should be alright though
<Bronysith> if i got the tardis i would totally fuck up everything
<Sylandest1> laters, FairysHuff
<Barbetos> How about a millenium falcon that works like a tardis?
<ACS13123> I believe im in the same TF2 game as theinvertedshadow...
<Om> Sylandest1: I know. Wishful thinking never hurt
<ACS13123> anyone know him?
<ACS13123> or heard of him?
<ACS13123> :p
<Sylandest1> Om: hehe, indeed :)
<Polydunami> ... If I had a TARDIS I'd probably hide it in a secret place no one knows about and never use it
<Polydunami> Because, you know, time
<ACS13123> FlareChaser|TF2: I see you're on TF2 :p
<Polydunami> ... But I've never had the ability to travel through time so I wouldn't know :S
<Bronysith> Polydunami: id use it for travel and if i went back in time it would be for observations
<Polydunami> What kind of observations, Bronysith? :3
<Bronysith> Polydunami: the moon launch, important events through history
<Bronysith> the crucification of christ
<Polydunami> You mean crucifixion?
<ScootaChicken> Goddamnit
<Bronysith> whatever
<ScootaChicken> Why is Denegoth never on when I need him the most.
<ScootaChicken> Need to ask him about HR
<Polydunami> Oh hey ScootaChicken, it's been a while :3
<ScootaChicken> OH WHOOPS
<ScootaChicken> Wrong chat XD
<Bronysith> To see the crucifixion of christ would prove that god is real
<ScootaChicken> And hey Polydunami, nice to see ya :3
<Bronysith> and his resurrection
<ScootaChicken> Polydunami: How's it going?
<Polydunami> I'm doing fine
<alexxm> Bronysith how would it do that
<Polydunami> Hey Bronysith, you'd have corroboration if you saw Jesus walking around three days after his death as well.
<Polydunami> Not to mention actually checking if he was dead behorehand
<otakon> hiya guys what's up?

<Big_Macintosh_1992> pretty good sagas. just finished work
<Hawkie> LOL junh1024-XD
<junh1024-XD> well, the FFT will still jump up &* down because it's still the orignal song
<sagas> Oh where do you work Big_Macintosh_1992?
<junh1024-XD> that;s Skylands's scpt, not mine
<killerpony7733> but if i actually had to make a actual OC i would include the actual eye color pattern my eyes have due to my heterochromia iridium
<junh1024-XD> &hi Hawkie

<Om> Panda-: I'm cooking bacon! that is all you missed.
<Panda-> i want some
<Hawkie> oh
<Hawkie> right
<Hawkie> sorry
<junh1024-XD> you're applying modifications 2 the time domain
<sagas> Big_Macintosh_1992: Never heard of it. Is it just local or a chain?
<Hawkie> LOL
<killerpony7733> Saturn by chance would you know what heterochromia iridium is?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> sagas: its a chain
<junh1024-XD> ghen my hands are frozen, lemme warm them up
*sagas is watching The Legend of Korra
<cowvarkian> orly
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what's funny?
<cowvarkian> which episodes
<Big_Macintosh_1992> sagas: is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I just did a hard limiter of 150dB to this song
<cowvarkian> *episode
<drfsupercenter> 03and it still sounds decent
<Om> Panda-: I don't think you can :I
<sagas> Big_Macintosh_1992: Sounds good
<Bronysith> WoW Christopher Eccleson did a great job as the doctor
<drfsupercenter> 03also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else?
<Panda-> Om: email me some?
<Om> Panda-: E-mail you bacon?
<Panda-> Om: yes :D
<cowvarkian> seems legit
<Bronysith> Om: i just emailed u some strips
<sagas> Bronysith: I personally like the 11th doctor more
<Om> Panda-: You just want my e-mail >.>
<Om> Bronysith: And you don't know it.
<prince-lemon> sagas: GTFO
<Bronysith> sagas: im still on the 9th dr. i still need to see the 11th and 4th
<Bronysith> sagas: i mean 10th
<Panda-> Om: what? no! you can use what ever email you want
<sagas> prince-lemon: Holy shit! your not a bot?
<Panda-> all doctors are best doctor?
<Shamroc> sagas: le-fail
<prince-lemon> Lawl
<Om> Panda-: I know what you are up to.
<Panda-> Om... look... im not up to anyting :(
<Shamroc> mooooodead
<sagas> prince-lemon: Well you never speak except to post new EqDaily posts
<prince-lemon> Been busy
<sagas> I will stand behind my prefference for the 11th doctor
<prince-lemon> There is no 11th Doctor
<junh1024-XD> if you want the song to look like a brick in the FFT, you nd2 apply modifications to the frequency domain
<Shamroc> sagas: he doesnt like the 11th one bit
<prince-lemon> The last Doctor was number 10
<prince-lemon> :o
<Bronysith> sagas: i havent seen the 11th doctor. so far only the 9th doctor. i still want to see the 4th and 10th
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: is the 4th dr any good?
<junh1024-XD> , like a multiband compressor (A3 has one). these are commonly used by studios to jack up the volume of the songs another way
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I noticed that with songs like
<drfsupercenter> 0399 Red Balloons
<Bronysith> chat
<drfsupercenter> 03even using hard limiting, the beginning & end parts still sound quieter
<sagas> prince-lemon: Whats with the hate for Matt Smith?
<junh1024-XD> I also have something which limits the FFT so that it looks like a brick. Trust me, that sounds REALLY crap.
<Shamroc> is
<drfsupercenter> 03so I wonder how radio stations do it
<Om> Panda-: I know just pullin your leg xD
<Shamroc> sligthly
<prince-lemon> 4th is probably the most popular out of the old Who Doctors
<Shamroc> dead
<junh1024-XD> AGC/riding
<Panda-> Om: oh ^^ hehe
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: what do you think of the 9th dr?
<junh1024-XD> nter> also, does it make any difference if you change the "seek" time from 7ms to something else? < do you mena lookahead?
<prince-lemon> sagas: Nah, I've textwalled why I hate him so many times before
<prince-lemon> :P
<Shamroc> Wrek: ALL THE BUTTON MASHIN
<prince-lemon> 9th is good
<SirGanjalf> Brb, gonna play Torchlight(no casz for diablo:()
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<sagas> prince-lemon: oh I never see any of them
<SirGanjalf> *cash
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<drfsupercenter> 03can you do AGC in a DAW?
<sagas> prince-lemon: Like I said, I always thought you were a bot
<junh1024-XD> yes-ish]
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/gIQkJ.png <- Green Day - Holiday after doing two Hard Limiting of 100dB (the max)
<drfsupercenter> 03song still sounds fairly OK LOL
<prince-lemon> Yeah, probably last time I ranted about it was a while ago
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: recommend the best Doctors.

<sagas> Panda-: Apparently not I just learned
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: whos ur fav of those three then?
<prince-lemon> 10th
<sagas> prince-lemon: same here
<killerpony7733> Wrek quick question do you take commissions?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL the results of fade-outs
<prince-lemon> So much man-love for 10th
<prince-lemon> Because MOTHERFUCKING TENNANT
<sagas> prince-lemon: Ive only seen the 9th 10th and 11th
<sagas> prince-lemon: but I still prefer the 11th
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: i gotta finish the 9th dr before. i cant wait to see the 10th
<otakon> hiya prince-lemon
<prince-lemon> Silly, there's no 11th.
<sagas> prince-lemon: Tennant is a close 2nd
<prince-lemon> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03also junh1024-XD, am I correct in assuming that a computer-produced sine wave (like the radio 'beeps') are the loudest-sounding you can possibly have for any given dB level?
<HyperMetalLugia> whee
<otakon> prince-lemon: how are ya today man? Also, MATT SMITH OWNS YOU!
<prince-lemon> Ohai otakhan
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: just like how theres only the OT of star wars?
<junh1024-XD> no, square waves are the loudest
<prince-lemon> Exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03generally I'll make 1kHz beeps at like, 1/4 volume and it still sounds loud
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<sagas> prince-lemon: MATT SMITH FTW!
<prince-lemon> And how the Matrix isn't a trillogy
<prince-lemon> :>
<drfsupercenter> 03but sine waves are close?
<prince-lemon> trilogy*
<otakon> prince-lemon: lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, a sine wave will be louder than any "natural" music, right?
<sagas> Denial never makes things better, prince-lemon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dead ?
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: or how theres no 13 in final fantasy
<junh1024-XD> well, depending on how you do the loudness
<prince-lemon> Denial? I deny nothing. :>
<sagas> I also enjoyed the MAtrix sequals
<Bronysith> sagas: what about the star wars prequels?
<prince-lemon> That just fits with your like of other inferior things. :P
*Bronysith prepares lightsaber
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL.
<drfsupercenter> 03so I made a 1kHz square wave
<drfsupercenter> 03>goes in the red already
<sagas> prince-lemon: They arent as good as the first, but I still enjoyed them
<Panda-> sagas: answer carefully
<Bronysith> sagas: word your next few sentences carefully. they may be your last
<Bronysith> sagas: now tell me. what do you think of the horrible fanfiction that is the star wars prequels?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Sumica: hey, which Aliens movie is showing tonight?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh my god
<drfsupercenter> 03square wave sounds horrible compared to sine wave
<junh1024-XD> triangle waves are inbetween
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Audacity only does square, sine, sawtooth
<sagas> Bronysith: They werent as good as the original trilogy, but I was still able to enjoy them. Nowhere near as good as expected
<drfsupercenter> 03sine sounds the best
<Bronysith> sagas: hmmmm
<drfsupercenter> 031kHz sine wave is what radios use to blip swearing AFAICT
<junh1024-XD> generate sine, triangle, and square waves in A3 and look at the FFT
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: What are those three things exactly?
<junh1024-XD> sine has one harmonic, square waves have many more
<junh1024-XD> hence it sounds louder for a particular peak/amplitude
<Bronysith> sagas: the lightsaber battles in the prequels were terrible. they were more like dancing then actual fighgting
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I think sawtooth is what you mean by triangle?
<junh1024-XD> no
<DashWithRainbows> dari, what you doing here? You should be with Olly or Nailbait.
<Panda-> Bronysith: have mercy on the poor guy, sagas doesnt know what he knows xD
<Bronysith> now i go and eat delicoius dinner
<prince-lemon> Haven't seen Olly today
<junh1024-XD> saw is kinda like a skewed triangle
*Bronysith drags sagas into the overns

<junh1024-XD> draw your own (r)
*sagas on principle
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge most enemies with vampire abilities on higher diffculties
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03that would just be a sine wave with varying amplitutes, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03*d
<prince-lemon> You should have been there sagas
<Shamroc> dead
<prince-lemon> When I deleted all the Matt Smith episodes live on steram
<prince-lemon> stream*
<prince-lemon> It was a good day
<otakon> prince-lemon: lol
<sagas> prince-lemon: been there for what? What happened?
<otakon> prince-lemon: it was a good day indeed
<junh1024-XD> there are some programs which allow you to draw waves yourself, but if you want to make something audiable which lasts for more than 1ms, itll take aaages if you draw the whole thing manually
<prince-lemon> And there was much rejoicing
<alexxm> when was prince-lemon
<drfsupercenter> 03...LMAO
<drfsupercenter> 03this preset in CEP
<junh1024-XD> maybe 1sine + 1sine of higher frequency?
<drfsupercenter> 03called "out of control"
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: I want Diablo 3 so bad. But I am short on funds. Regardless I enjoy watching Wrek play.
<drfsupercenter> 03funniest FFT ever
<junh1024-XD> i boosted this song in A5 rite?
*junh1024-XD f2k Sinon - November 26 Ogata Rina - Cocktail light Mix (2chFLAC@852kbps, 27.27mb/4:27)
<junh1024-XD> with 50dB boost in limiter, i can hear the cymbals pumping & not very nice
<drfsupercenter> 03Haha this is hilarious
<drfsupercenter> 03the FFT looks like some jello
*sagas is still waiting to be informed on what he missed
<prince-lemon> I already said
<drfsupercenter> 03I am far more amused than I should be XD
<Panda-> otakon: who is matt smith?
<junh1024-XD> press alt X, does something come up?
<sagas> Oh nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean FFT?
<alexxm> Panda- 11th doctor
<sagas> That is just offensive, prince-lemon
<otakon> Panda-: the 11th Doctor, but prince-lemon hate's him so.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm using CEP, not A5
<junh1024-XD> no, i said alt X, not alt Z
<Panda-> alexxm: is there something wrong with him?
<prince-lemon> Panda-: A yeasty codpiece
<junh1024-XD> i know
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is alt x
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't do anything
<Panda-> otakon why does prince-lemon hate him?
<junh1024-XD> ok
<otakon> prince-lemon: just bc YOU don't like him doesn't mean everyone does
<sagas> You are defying and denying 2 seasons of Dr. Who, prince-lemon
<otakon> Panda-: no idea, ask him.
<Kammerjunk> Panda-: Because he's bad.
<junh1024-XD> in A3 it brings up a phase vectorscope
<prince-lemon> Offensive, offensive is what he's done to a show that enjoyed
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<otakon> sagas: he'd rather do that then admit THE TRUTH
<junh1024-XD> A4 doensn't have
<prince-lemon> I*
<otakon> prince-lemon: you should do a rant on lYoutube about Matt Smith
<drfsupercenter> 03go in A3 and do generate - wave, set to 1000Hz base, 30 seconds, "out of control"
<drfsupercenter> 03and play it

<MegaMoonShine> Well I'm off, guys. Cya!
<prince-lemon> The fact that Matt Smith's Doctor is actually a middle aged woman called Ruth
<otakon> bye MegaMoonShine take care
<Kammerjunk> sagas: He's the only 11th Doctor. That automatically makes him the best and the worst 11th Doctor.
<Viri> 14night Ray :3
<prince-lemon> Matt Smith can't be considered a Doctor until he's had some acting lessons
<prince-lemon> :P
<sagas> Kammerjunk: according to prince-lemon, there is no 11th doctor
<Kammerjunk> And I concur.
<otakon> lol prince-lemon
<Panda-> prince-lemon: oh man...
<DashWithRainbows> dari But who would even want to teach him?
<killerpony7733> Wrek why not rend?
<sagas> prince-lemon: So how many episodes of the 11th doctor have you actually watched? Oh and I fucking hate the 10ths companion
<prince-lemon> I dunno, not amount of money could convince me to have to look at his ugly face.
<killerpony7733> It bleeds them
<prince-lemon> no*
<Kammerjunk> I just don't like him in general. His entire way of being just doesn't sit with me.
<otakon> brb guys, bathroom
<DashWithRainbows> dari what if he was dead?
<junh1024-XD> yeah i don't know where you select your presets
<prince-lemon> 11th, I watched 1 or2 series of him
<prince-lemon> 1 or 2*
<Kammerjunk> sagas: Which one of them?
<prince-lemon> Can't remember exactly
<prince-lemon> But I watched a lot
<killerpony7733> Wrek damn

<Sparky> unless it's like a special episode where two are one

*Petrified_Discord feels clean
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'd rather just sit down and watch a series
<drfsupercenter> 03I wanna watch both Madoka and Panty and Stocking when those are fully released as dubs
<drfsupercenter> 03since both of them are doable in a day :P

<killerpony7733> IMissOsamaBrony it's actually a rule here to not spam alot of emotes is considered spamming :$
<sagas> otakon: with a hammer!
<Tax> Well so far beating him with a hammer seems to be working. Albeit slowly.
<Soital> 12k so why does club nintendo for usa have awesome stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03awesome what
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon:Lots of time and click spamming.
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate most of it xD

<Obsidian> sagas: He beat his shadow clone
<BTW> SirGanjalf: No probs.
<Shamroc> otakon: he only grabs you if he is able to stun you
<Vordox> What difficulty is this?
<Tax> Those cages don't react very well, and the bolts falling from the sky probably hurt.
<Vordox> Wrek, PM please music =3
<drfsupercenter> 03like what
<sagas> So what sorta percentage does Wrek have at succeeding in this fight?
<Wrek> 05see? the earthquake is bollocks cause he just jump out of it, berserker with 100% bonus dmg is way more controllable therefore better
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'd totally get you something,t hat's low little I care about those rewards xD

<Iron_Edge> Wrek: -lol- and here comes the big question. What to do now....-lol- :D
*Chains drives a van around in circles, doing donuts

<cow334> Nittany_Discord: awesome zergs for the win
<Vordox> SirGanjalf: Demon gonna demons
<Everlasting_Joy> I shall return, need to make dinner.

<BroKnee> I'm uber close to being able to make the staff and go there myself xD
<sagas> CriticKitten: Well then that is just lazy story writing
*Chains gives BroKnee a cracker
<CriticKitten> Obviously killing him doesn't purge the world of evil. :p
<Meanwhile> panda: Correct, you win my contempt.
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<BroKnee> *nomz the cracker in the corner of the room*
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: nope.avi you have to do it all over again
<Obsidian> Hi Meanwhile
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Meanwhile
<Evenprime> sagas: The diablo universe works like this: Trap a demon in a soulstone, they stay in there. Kill them, and they will literally respawn sometime in the future.
<String_Shredder> hey Meanwhile
<CCCP> hi Meanwhile :)
<cow334> Chains: wy craccker wy not grass that stuff is the best

<Shamroc> Meanwhile: stop starting man stop startin

<Meanwhile> Start stoppin' Shamroc.
<SirGanjalf> Is this Tristram?

<Chains> Harrumph Harrumph
<CriticKitten> It actively screws D2's continuity in the bum. ;P
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what?
<SirGanjalf> Bar Brawl!
<Skylands> 10He's voice chatting me
<Skylands> 10:P
<Evenprime> sagas: yes. But it's their fault for naming the game "Diablo" isntead of "demon hunting" or something. XD
<cow334> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03that's fairly random.
<Chains> Does this f:Ok you?
<Skylands> 10Yep
<Evenprime> They have to live with that
*Meanwhile gives sagas a high five.
<drfsupercenter> 03y people no ask me
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: the entire plot to diablo is to murder hellspawn to death. thats it
<Skylands> 10He offered
<CCCP> Meanwhile: is best pony ever
<Meanwhile> Bronysith, Shamroc, you startin'?
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: Not quite
<sagas> Evenprime: Well they could go after a different demon or something and name it after them
<Skylands> 10since he finally got around to accepting my Skype request after how many months now?
*Chains gives cow334 a handful of grass
<BroKnee> Bronysith: And to kill Diablo....3 times

<Shamroc> Meanwhile..oy stop starting...start stopin the starting of the stoping...ya slag
<sagas> CCCP: No its the truth im telling you!
*Skylands chews Chimew
<CriticKitten> The first game features a lot of minor hellspawn with Diablo at the end. THe second has you kill Diablo and his bros. Diablo 3 is a belated attempt to clean up the leftovers of the first two games and ham-handed resurrects Diablo again despite this being impossible. >.>
<CCCP> :o
*CCCP is shocked
<Diglett> hi guys
<panda> CCCP cant argue dat logic :=

<killerpony7733> Wrek it was a good and long stream
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<junh1024-XD> PMMM RA V1-3 BDs also on nyaa
<VioletVanilla> 06Grüße Gott Meanwhile~ <3
<Evenprime> how long is alien 3 (runtime) roughly?
<drfsupercenter> 03RA?
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: It's a good game, but the plot is trash. And saying "it doesn't need a plot" is precisely why AAA gaming is allowed to get away with murder. Because you let them charge you 60 bucks for a 20 dollar experience and then make excuses for them. >_>
<junh1024-XD> Region A
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03volume 3? It's finished now?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Do you have any idea what would be a good laptop for under $800?
<Chains> I'm sorry I couldn't give you a cracker, CriticKitten, I ran out. *Eats my third cracker* I thought there was enough for 1 each.
<Skylands> 10Shishi!
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<junh1024-XD> apppppparently so
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02When I look at laptops and it gives me all this information I can't tell if it's good or bad
<Diglett> hey is alien on tonight
<drfsupercenter> 03well I don't really want to look right now :/
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Sky.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<otakon> CriticKitten: well, Dragon's Dogma has a lousy, preachy plot but the gameplay is grea
<sagas> Story/plot is very important!
<drfsupercenter> 03did you have any specific places you had to order from etc?
<otakon> Diglett: nope, it's Alien3
<cow334> Pfft alien's are not real even do I see them take away my family an the farm land every day and the only thing i can say is ..... Moo
*Chains gives otakon a traffic light
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nope, anywhere is fine
<Obsidian> Its Alien 3
<drfsupercenter> 03k
*Shiny-Growlithe was checking out Best Buy atm
<BroKnee> CriticKitten: In my opinion Diablo 3 has been at least a $100 experiance, I can't stop playin the dang thing xD
<CriticKitten> otakon: True, but Dragon's Dogma has other flaws that kill it as a game.
<otakon> Chains: huh? what's this for?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god
<sagas> So on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is Alien3?
<drfsupercenter> 03avoid them at all costs LOL
*Chains is now passing out random things because I ran out of crackers
<otakon> CriticKitten: the CONSTANT BACKTRACKING sadly comes to mind
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: yea i worded that wrong. i just never cared for the plot to diablo man. and yes. the plots to AAA games are terrible because of graphics and focus on making a single player game multiplayer. its all bullshit
<panda> Chains xD
<Diglett> otakon: I knew that
*ZappyTheUnicorn eats his cracker
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ok XD
<BroKnee> *Hugglez Chains*
<CriticKitten> BroKnee: That's another thing that bugs me. Hours don't translate to monetary value,.
<drfsupercenter> 03well

<drfsupercenter> 03they just charge way too much
*Chains gives Diglett an NYC Taxi's trunk door

<cow334> Bronysith: ohh okay
<Jim> Face huggers are best ponies
<CCCP> DocSane: hi

<Darf14> I have to admit, the pony audience reminds me of MST3000 :)
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: its like the ultimate deep throat
<DocSane> CCCP: hey there
<Fleta> Good evening Bronystate!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I have to ask then, how cheap is "cheap"?
<Bronysith> Chains: me

*Bronysith glomps Fleta
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Meanwhile , look what you could get if you spend $50 on welovefine :p http://www.welovefine.com/img/cms/gifts/mustache.jpg
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Aliens need to start stoppin'
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you can spend $800, definitely try to stick to that. Like really, the more the better
<killerpony7733> Barbetos i would laugh if they were called crotch huggers
<drfsupercenter> 03ideally you want one with a dedicated video card
<|Discord|> sagas: You did?
*Fleta is glomped by Bronysith :D
<drfsupercenter> 03most of the cheaper ones have onboard cards
<devildog> is this aliens 3
<Midnight_Fyre> Is this the extended version?
<Obsidian> devildog: Yes
<DocSane> devildog: I'm afraid it is
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Why would I need that? I could just scan mine and print it for the same effect.
<drfsupercenter> 03because unlike desktops, you can't really upgrade the graphics in a laptop :/
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: them aliens are slags...so are their mums...and need to stop starting..
<Bronysith> Midnight_Fyre: all versions are the extended versions of everything
*Chains gives devildog a shelf
<cow334> This this .... is actually a pretty good movie
*Bronysith slaps Chains
<DocSane> cow334: No. It really isn't.
<Chains> OW
<devildog> yay
<Distortion> Large middle finger to audience who cared about the crew intiated in t-minus 10 seconds
<Fleta> I haven't seen this in a long time
*Chains punches Bronysith
<sagas> |Discord|: Yes! Its unique and original to you, making it better than one made in a pony creator
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile reasons, idk :p
<cow334> DocSane: well I like it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's go outside, into the cold.
<dusk_fly> David Fincher directed this? Nice
<Jim> Spaaaaace
<CriticKitten> In space, no one can hear you scream about the quality of your film~
<dusk_fly> Makes me wanna watch Se7en :D
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: The cold of space!
<RustyMeat> SO I missed the begging what happened?
<Shamroc> Sumica: ponies i way of word!
<DocSane> cow334: Afraid I can't do anything to help you with that.
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: you do need to stop startin'. And them aliens are slags.
<Diglett> SPAAAACE
*Chains gives Jim a car bumper
<Midnight_Fyre> What century?

<Fleta> I just noticed the MST3K Ponies! :)
<Darf14> ^
<Distortion> Gray sky is bland
<Jim> Chains: But why do I need a car bumper?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those ponies are in the way TBH.
<Spriggals> reminds me of Dayz
<Shamroc> Meanwhile.stop starting ye slag.....
<sagas> did the ocean shrink?
<Chains> Jim: Idk. I ran out of crackers to hand out.
<DocSane> RustyMeat: Face hugger appeared from nowhere, screwed up the SUlaco, caused stasis pods to be ejected.
<cow334> DocSane: umm.. I don't really understand were you're getting to
<Darf14> man, earth is kinda of a grabage dump in the future
<devildog> theirs ponys on the screen cool
<Tovler> disregard subtitles, acquire MST3K ponies.
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: You started startin' ye slag.
<Midnight_Fyre> Nittany_Discord: Agreed. I couldn't read the intro
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Right
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: muffin? would you like one?
<ROHKARA> Did Earth downgrade itself after the second movie
<Jim> Darf14: Earth is kind of a garbage dump at the moment
<Distortion> Facehugger is that smart?
<drfsupercenter> 03typically you CAN add more memory and a bigger hard drive, so those are less important.
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: nah ye started the startin of the starting....ye slag
<SirGanjalf> dem ponies
<Darf14> True
<DocSane> Midnight_Fyre: Subtitles were "Space prison for space loonies"
<Bronysith> Jim: /)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Which is why I'm buying a new laptop lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Processor and video is what you want to look for

<SirGanjalf> Falloutception
<DocSane> It's a prison colony.

<Barbetos> But it was filmed on earth. I can see where the confusion lies/
<Fleta> CCCP : 1992
*Chains gives Darf14 a butter knife
<Distortion> I like big ships. Thanks Chains:)
<ROHKARA> That previous planet made it look like Earth
<Barbetos> NOAW!!

*Fleta puts butter on Meanwhile ... mmmmm toast....
<devildog> waht happend to newt
<killerpony7733> CCCP i'm eating strawberries with milk and sugar like a boss :)
<CriticKitten> Only one survivor, Lt Ripley. Believe it or not,.
<CCCP> nice angle
<Spriggals> I spy with my little eye.
<Sumica> 00,10odd, her cloting was grey before.
*Meanwhile bonks Fleta in the head with a cinderblock.
<Midnight_Fyre> Does Promethius use those same greenscreen computers that all the rest of the movies have used so far?
<Jim> Who even uses Fallout-ish computers in the future?
*Chains gives Fleta a pair of pants
<Obsidian> devildog: you will see
<CCCP> killerpony7733: aweome! /)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh wait so like...ohh

<Shamroc> newt be dead
<drfsupercenter> 03hm>?
<Obsidian> she dead
<sagas> 10 yas old?
<DocSane> Hicks, Newt, Bishop. Dead.
<Distortion> Ripley really doesn't like human men. She only cared about the cat in the first movie and the little girl in the second.:|
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For some reason I was thinking of screenshot LOL
<Bronysith> Shamroc: super ded
<Fleta> Newt? Nooooooooo
<devildog> was that her
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Cypresswolf> aww :( That's sad
<Chains> Who wants the last cracker?
<Barbetos> Bishop is just off actually.
<Obsidian> debug: eeyup
<sagas> Chains: ME!
<SirGanjalf> Jim: Well, Fallout is set in quite distant future as well
<DocSane> It was at this moment that I knew I'd hate this movie
<Spriggals> I spy with my little eye somthing white
*Ran 2shinypounces
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel like these Alien movies weren't meant to have sequels.
<Chains> No, sagas! No seconds!
<cow334> Spriggals: the text wall?
<Vordox> Didn't that ....just REMOVE everyrhing good about the Aleisn 2?
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Aliens was the only real sequel.
<Spriggals> Yes
<Spriggals> Correct
<DocSane> Vordox: EXACTLY!
<ROHKARA> Common sequal problem, destroying all continuity from the previous movie
<Midnight_Fyre> Bullshit movie, you can't just kil off the girl because she refused to star in your crappy film. Come up with something better
<sagas> Now we must watch A vs P!
<Obsidian> Nittany_Discord: Thats why they stopped at 3
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: probably not. is predator also made by ridley scott?
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord everyone always end up with being a kill fest
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02All these numbers and letters I don't know what they mean .-.
<DocSane> It's David Fincher giving a middle finger to James Cameron.
*Shiny-Growlithe ransprawls
<cow334> I have to admit do part one was my favorite of aliens
<DocSane> Bronysith: No
<Meanwhile> Then you get this, which ruins the ending of the last one within ten minutes, and the [information redacted by galactic police]
<Midnight_Fyre> DocSane: And to the audience
<Chains> WHO WANTS THE LAST CRACKER?
<Fleta> Vordox : Yeah, why'd they bump off Newt and moot the awesome boss fight? :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,012 was good, but it ended well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And now they kill off the little girl and the android?
<Diglett> killerpony7733 and the final alien went to space
<CriticKitten> Give us strength, o Lord, to endure this film
*sagas hasnt seen any other Alien movie
<Jim> Gods be mad
<DocSane> And Hicks.
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: yeah but I likeed the ending of part one
<Fleta> God is PISSED!
<DocSane> Don't forget Cpl. Hicks
<Distortion> In next reboot cat that was saved by Ripley is infected.
<Meanwhile> Does God have to slap a pope?
<sagas> And then God sends the Alien upon them
*Bronysith slaps Meanwhile
<Jim> Luna controll?
<Darf14> Alein and Aliens are the best in the series, 3 is meh but Resurrectin should burn in heck
<SirGanjalf> Eevee?
<Midnight_Fyre> His voice is irtritating
<SirGanjalf> 47!
<Jim> Hitman!
<Spriggals> AGENT 47
<sagas> Meanwhile is the pope?

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02For the laptops
<junh1024-XD> well, i'm gonna say allofdem is important
<sagas> WEVE ALL TAKEN THE VOW!
*VioletVanilla smiles taking the cracker happily <3
<Darf14> Burn the WItch
<Bronysith> Jim: a newt?
<Jim> Bronysith: I got better...
<junh1024-XD> if one unit is actuing as a bottleneck, it'll slow many things down
<junh1024-XD> depending.
<Chains> VioletVanilla: That was the last one *Wink*
<drfsupercenter> 03well yes
<Midnight_Fyre> Jim: Do not speak of Newt. Too soon
<drfsupercenter> 03but you can upgrade the RA
<drfsupercenter> 03*RAM
<Obsidian> SHes a violator of harmony!
<ROHKARA> Space Monks
<Barbetos> ASA peee peeee
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't upgrade GPU
*sagas is sad that he didnt get Chains last cracker
<Barbetos> te he

<Darf14> Looks like a boys club
<Diglett> door*
<Chains> CCCP: I thought I had enough for everypony, but more ponies joined. So I handed out random stuff.
<Meanwhile> It's a prison.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mine might be for gaming too /cough
<CCCP> Chains: oh lol
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
*Bronysith hands Chains tea
<drfsupercenter> 03here hang on
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll look around for you
<Chains> Merci.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03do you have a preference on screen size?
<DocSane> Gentlemen, you are an amorphous mass of bald Brtitish guys. You will all soon be dead, so don't bother with names or having personalities or anything.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's kinda something you can't change
<drfsupercenter> 03so I generally sort that first
<sagas> If its a prison, why did they all take a vow of celebacy?
*Chains splashes the tea in my face
<Chains> It's quite fine, yes.
<Darf14> Shots awaken the frozen
<devildog> that sucks one girl and a bunch of dudes
<Distortion> What Seems legit DocSane:D
<Bronysith> devildog: can you say. loose?

<Darf14> So hes the Medic
*sagas wipes Chains face dry
<devildog> lol
<Arteza147> Hey guys
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02As long as it's not like incredibly tiny. Like one of those noteboks or something. Otherwise I'm fine with anything.
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean netbooks?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi Arteza147
<drfsupercenter> 03and well, the two popular sizes are 13" and 15"
*Chains gives Arteza147 a lightbulb
<ROHKARA> Does that mean that they don't have the same special effects budget as the previous movie
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just a matter of personal prefernce really
<drfsupercenter> 03but for now I'll do the 15" ones since there's more of them
<otakon> I'm back
<otakon> they DIDN'T MAKE IT
<Jim> wb otakon
<Chains> HEYA
<sagas> otakon: we missed you!
<Shamroc> NEKKID

<Arteza147> what have i missed?
<drfsupercenter> 03woah
<otakon> Arteza147: she just woke up
<Spriggals> Put a hitler stash under her nose and shes good
<Bronysith> Arteza147: the dr sent a nuke into london
<drfsupercenter> 03all these screens suck unless you spend at least $830 :<
<Darf14> ok.....never mind
<SirGanjalf> For a guy who didn't have seen a woman in along time, he is pretty unimpressed
<sagas> Like I asked, if its a prison, why did they take a vow of celebacy?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02D:

<otakon> SirGanjalf: he's a psychopath...you know like Meanwhile
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: magic!
<drfsupercenter> 03high res ones have sharper image etc
<DocSane> sagas: The prisoners all follow a weird religion of their own.
<Obsidian> Arteza147: Ripley is the only survivor of her crew again.
<Meanwhile> otakon: oi.
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: she needs to stop startin
*otakon pours Meanwhile a cup of Ear Grey, hot. "Here"
<Arteza147> Obsidian: What about newt and david?
<sagas> DocSane: That is a weird prison....
<Obsidian> Arteza147: Dead
*Chains drives a Ford F-150 with top-mounted floodlights

<Jim> hai FlareChaser
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's "normal"
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello FlareChaser
<Arteza147> not newt
<drfsupercenter> 03Most laptops have a resolution of 1366x768
<Darf14> yeah....alien 3 made saving the girl completely pointless >_<
<sagas> well at least she wasnt conciouse so it was painless
<otakon> yeah, Newt
<DocSane> sagas: This is a bad movie. Stuff just is.
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, emotions.
<Obsidian> Arteza147: Welcome to ALiens 3
<devildog> no newt :(
<drfsupercenter> 03mine's got 1680x1050 on the same size screen, for reference

*Chains drives past everypony
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ohh
<Arteza147> Obsidian: Theyve already jumped the shark!
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: ...hey you want a strange razorback?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so the girl was saved just to have her die in the first minutes of the movie ?
<DocSane> Okay, now the movie just gets cruel to fans of the last movie.
<Darf14> I concur otakon
<Meanwhile> Yeah well the title of the film is "Alien3" If there weren't aliens it'd be random.
<Obsidian> True enough
*Bronysith blows up Chains car
<Midnight_Fyre> Why not just say the truth?
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: nah
<cow334> Chains: WOW nice ride man
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah true.
<Chains> FUK U GAWDMAWDUR
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: sure
<sagas> I hate to be repeticiouse, but im gonna repeat myself anyways
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: give it to me when u can!
<CriticKitten> She was my baby daddy~
<Barbetos> She wants it to be a surprise when the aliens get out
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: WAITWAIT I want something
<Barbetos> you know, make it fun.
<DocSane> It's more like this movie was made to completely invalidate the happy ending of the last one.
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: wat?
<Distortion> She is exploding emotionally because she is not used to feeling emotions other than hissy fit:|
*Chains sagas steps in front of me like last time
<SirGanjalf> But what about Mr. Joneees???
<sagas> So what is the next trilogy we're gonna watch?
<Shamroc> hey FlareChaser want 4 strange knives and 4 strange pistols?
<Arteza147> Wow. A giant fuck you, right to the fans already!
<Obsidian> SirGanjalf: Still on earth
<Meanwhile> Yup, she's dead alright.

<otakon> Sumica: walnuts would do.
<killerpony7733> Chat derped :|
<DocSane> Ripley is told to avoid parading around in front of prisoners.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: She already has bigger balls than the entire marine corp did.

<Jim> Little does she know that was jarate
<Drake> 04'Sup NS
<Ulthane> now i dont know anymore
<otakon> Arteza147: it's Twi/Spike, RD, Rarity, AJ, Pinkie and FS from left to right.
<panda> Meanwhile again?
<sagas> I can feel them undressing her with their eyes
<Barbetos> Don't talk to me WOMAN!

<Meanwhile> Oh so you're a murderer and a rapist huh? No worries I'll just sit opposite you. :D
<SirGanjalf> It was!
<CriticKitten> She ain't takin' yo shit
<otakon> Arteza147: np! :)
<Barbetos> Then Ripley proceeds to do a strip tease.
<Distortion> Ripley wants table friends damn it!
<ROHKARA> It's like they want us to root for the alien
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> tolerate
<Jim> Love and tolerate

<Spriggals> ^^
<Arteza147> ROHKARA: You mean you arent?
<DocSane> The prisoners are all Bronies?
<Meanwhile> Tolerate the intolerable. This guy's a brony.
<Fleta> ^^^^
<sagas> ROHKARA: I feel the same way with the SAW series
<Barbetos> Planet Austrailia has no room for Love. just tolerance.
<Ulthane> otakon my theory: people are okay to watch people die, but dogs dying is unacceptable
<Obsidian> Thats not a good sign
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: he requires all the brohooves! ?)
<Distortion> To die duh!
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: /)
<Blaze> Hey guys, what did I mi- HOLY MYSTERY PONY THEATER!!!

<panda> Meanwhile everyone is a brony
<Shimmer> Hiya everypony

<CriticKitten> Well....I'm going to avoid the low-hanging fruit with that joke
*Bronysith stabs sagas with a lightsaber
<otakon> Ulthane: huh, makes sense. Damn PETA going on about those dogs.
<Spectrum_Plush> panda: they just dont know it yet
<Spriggals> Anypony find it funny how the blackguy is the preacher?
<otakon> CriticKitten: do it.
<devildog> hi Shimmer

<CriticKitten> otakon: No way, it's too easy
<Saturn> 08,01but i've already got an octavia shirt
<Distortion> Less sexy than Samus.
<Sumica> 00,10So are they still in the way or should I just go back to Fleur/
<Blaze> otakon: WOO!
<Obsidian> Saturn: Can never have too much Octy
<CriticKitten> YEAH, I've damaged my reputation with these criminals by daring to save you!

<Spriggals> The janitor...
<Distortion> Keep running into aliens for some reason.
<Jim> inb4 ded
<ekips> I sense the first death incoming
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I think Fleur is less invasive but by and large I don't think they cover anything major.
<otakon> the hell kind of music is that?
<killerpony7733> Jim damn ninja'd
<Arteza147> Well gee. I wonder who will die...
<sagas> ponies watching Alien 3 just feels wrong to me

<CriticKitten> Mop mop mop while I sing dis song
<Distortion> Hell is that voice.:[
<DocSane> It looks like some kind of secreted resin.
<Midnight_Fyre> Are they trying to make us want these people to die?
<otakon> This is NOT gonna end well....
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: you betcha

<Fleta> Spike!!!
<Sakari> Spike :D
<ekips> oh Spike, you sure have changed a lot
<Jim> Not Scruffy the Janitor!
<sagas> Spike is an Alien? Makes sense
<Midnight_Fyre> Alien is Spike. It's canon
<otakon> ACID SPIT!
<Blaze> WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!
<Meanwhile> But will he blend?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> bzzzzzzz

<otakon> Nittany_Discord: puree is a good word in this case
<SirGanjalf> FANTALITY
<Fleta> He gonna need a lot of duct tape
<Spectrum_Plush> Nittany_Discord: squelch
<Blaze> WHich Aliens movie is this?
<otakon> oh look, former marine
<sagas> well it cant use his body to replicate if he falls into the fan
<otakon> Blaze: it's 3
<Darf14> Its the 3rd movie
<Jim> oo, they're gonna have to glue you back together
<CriticKitten> And by affections, I mean sex
<DocSane> Notice they were having him act like the alien was a dog, even though in this version the dog has been replaced with a cow.
<Sumica> 00,10gonna burry what's left of him in a soup can.
<Blaze> otakon: Then that means... we only have one more before.... RESURECTION...
<Arteza147> GAME OER MAN!
<sagas> I thought they were celebate
<otakon> sagas: they got rid of that mechanic, they can only reproduce via Queen
<otakon> Blaze: not showing that one.
<DocSane> There was no sign of a dog EVER in this version.
<Skylands> 10I need to rewatch Yumekui Merry
<Everlasting_Joy> Woof.
<Blaze> otakon: .....THAT....IS....AWESOME.
<Distortion> Alternate ending. Spike turns into good Ridley. Destroys the aliens and revives Newt with the power of friendship. They fly together to happy new adventures:)
<JESmith71> Blaze, didn't you read the newsletter? There WERE ONLY THREE!
<ROHKARA> I'm convinced that this movie is a parody of Alien movies
<otakon> DocSane: eeyup, so that whole "Spike?" scene was just pointless.
<Arteza147> otakon: That breaks the continuity of the 3rd game then.
<sagas> otakon: So is this movie only gonna be one Alien?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> fraternizing
<junh1024-XD> Yumekui Merry has dub now lol
<Skylands> 10I don't do dubs
<CriticKitten> otakon: Awww, but Resurrection would be fun to mock. ;_;
<Arteza147> sagas: No.
<Spriggals> Wear a condom kids
<junh1024-XD> I don't do alcohol
<Barbetos> Hitman?
<DocSane> sagas: There is technically more than one alien in this movie.
*junh1024-XD walks
<Skylands> 10Neither do I
<Arteza147> ANDROID!
<sagas> Arteza147: Then wheres the queen?
<otakon> Arteza147: well, not really. Apparently they CAN turn into queens in certain circumstances, but that takes time.
<SirGanjalf> "I was an assasin..."
*Bronysith hands Spriggals a milky way wrapper
<Spriggals> lol
<otakon> SirGanjalf: he was number 1047
<Obsidian> No Spoilers
<Jim> He's on that kind of market
<Arteza147> sagas: She hasn't been "born" yet
<SirGanjalf> otakon: Precisely
<A11ectis> "...but then I took an arrow to the knee."
<CriticKitten> >accident
<Meanwhile> Diced.
<otakon> SirGanjalf: I see you got that ref.
<sagas> Spriggals: Does the milky way wrapper count?
<Meanwhile> Like a goddamn carrot.
*Bronysith force chokes A11ectis
<CCCP> wait
<Spriggals> yes
<Darf14> Diced and sliced
<otakon> I have to go...MY PLANET NEEDS ME!
<brony_swan> gunna go get a drink
<CCCP> i see
<Bronysith> A11ectis: skyrim is incredibly lame and you are now lame for bringing skyrim into chat
<otakon> he died on the way however
<Meanwhile> otakon: Where's that? Planet Shipton?
<otakon> Bronysith: it's a good game
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: :D (Woooop).
<Distortion> Ironiclly Ripley flirts with the one prisoner that doesn't want to rape her:P
<sagas> Arteza147: How is she gonna get born if there is only one Alien around and its not a queen?
<otakon> Meanwhile: no idea
<CCCP> brony_swan: y u no like skyrim?
<otakon> Distortion: lol
<Meanwhile> Dat boot.
<Arteza147> sagas: Just watch.
<Sumica> 00,10damn, that meens we will have to send another prissoner down here to clean him up
<DocSane> Weird. I recall the doctor dying first in the original version.
<CriticKitten> Oh, I don't care about Murphy

*Shimmer shuffles Nittany_Discord
<Barbetos> Thats how he knew.
<Darf14> Who was it? They dont read the schedule that often
<otakon> sagas: it'll eventually turn INTO a Queen after it's lived long enough/eaten enough
*A11ectis has earned a new title: Lame.
<Arteza147> otakon: Wrong
<devildog> he forgot his boot
<otakon> well, it's simply COUNT head
<sagas> Are people in this movie all british?
<Jim> Touch goo, good idea
<otakon> there are only 25 prisoners goddammit
<otakon> dat acid
<Blaze> IT'S THE FREAKING ALIENS!!! HOW DOES NO ONE KNOW ABOUT THEM?!?!?
<Everlasting_Joy> "No shit" as in , "it's obvious" or no poop was blown about ;).
<Barbetos> Tara Strong was given the same warning, and she does not listen at all.

<Distortion> So many British accents:O
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is #1!

*sagas is #12

<Blaze> 0700? WHY MILITARY TIME?
<Arteza147> Saturn
<Distortion> Black man who says he is Murderawr does that count DocSane.

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> melee weapons, useless
<Jim> Use a butter knife as a weapon
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> were fucked
<Jim> Or a spoon
<Darf14> Build a prison, do not carry weapons! Surely we are the best prison there is
<Distortion> Guns would make the fight too easy.

<Hat> Doors look flimsy
<SirGanjalf> no. fuckin. way.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: 9th or 10th doctor? which you like
<Meanwhile> Well, obviously we know what to do then. Stick someone in it and get them to make a lot of noise.
<sagas> Yeah, thats what they said the last 2 movies
<Obsidian> Except for the acid blood that can melt through everything
<Litwick> Does anypony read the asktinkertots blog?
<Spectrum_Plush> R-Dash5000: ponies
<sagas> Why dont they lock themselves in there with supplies and wait?
<R-Dash5000> ???
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Amogst the two, 9th.
<CCCP> Litwick: whos that?
<Meanwhile> 85. His IQ.

<DocSane> He's technically retarded.
<Jim> Wait, wasn't someone called 19 there?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Uhh English and Math
<Renard> Any bored artists willing to help a small-size project out in there?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: no i mean among all 10 or whatever doctors
<sagas> I feel this plan will fail horribly
<Arteza147> Ass
<Jim> There are 11 doctors
<Shamroc> yeah...it will be first pony swag item accuired by me
<Meanwhile> Because if you don't the Aliens going to EAT your ass.
<Bronysith> Jim: thats why i said 10 or whatever
<Midnight_Fyre> Do you really have to ask that dumbass? It wants to kill you all
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: I've only seen the new series, so only 9,10 or 11, and I have a hard time between 9 and 11.
<Arteza147> DAMMIT JIM IM A DOCTOR, NOT A ________
<sagas> I vote lock myself in with a lot of supplies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> spend $50 and they will send you your own moustache
<Hat> This plan will go flawlessly
<sagas> Or, you know, suicide
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ahh okay. yea i amm currently enjoying the 9th doctor
<DocSane> Spread flammable liquid everywhere, there light flares.
<Shamroc> yeah i told my mom that...she was like *woopty doo* /sarcasm
<Darf14> Painting the floor :)
<DocSane> GRRRREEEEAAAAT plan.
<Jim> The 10th is brilliant
<sagas> Getting high is a bad thing now?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: That's fantastic.
<Prick> he's ded Jim
<Midnight_Fyre> Why are they painting the tunnel?
<Jim> He's not dead, he's just regenerated
<Ponies47> *Explodes*
<Hat> Why isn't the alien attacking while they prepare
<sagas> Bronysith: Get to the 11th. He is best
<Arteza147> This is TOTALLY going to work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, what are they spreading everywhere?
<devildog> i would put a lampshade on my head and stand still in one spot
<DocSane> They're painting it with flammable liquid.
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Explosive.
<sagas> Hat: Digestion?
<Everlasting_Joy> Hat, because that would make too much sense.
<Om> Mop water?
<Arteza147> Nittany_Discord: Flammable liquid
<Bronysith> sagas: ill be the judge of that mister guy who actually likes the star wars prequels
<Obsidian> I like the 10th doctor

<Darf14> ouch
<sagas> ded
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So, what's new with everypony? :3

<Om> The pressure wave would have killed them
<Sumica> 00,10budget was low, had to figure out a way to kill most the guys in one go.
<Litwick> Awwww what happened SB?
<Darf14> Theres a lot of candle/flashlight glare in this movie
<sagas> SuperBrony64: I am apparently hated by prince-lemon for thinking the 11th Doctor is the best
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: No, that's your job.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hehehehehe FIRE
<Ponies47> I have never played Minecraft :$
<DocSane> And there goes most of the completely forgetable characters.

<Arteza147> Nittany_Discord: After the movie, could someone stream the Alien campaign of the recent AvP game?
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: There really isn't anything new worth discussing on my end.
<Ponies47> Jim: Meh. Not now
<Bronysith> sagas: in the OT the force was a spirtitual thing and came from nature and stuff. in the prequels it was biological bullshit
<Darf14> Stop drop and roll!
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: I guess it is.
<Ponies47> devildog: Okie doki loki
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno who has it.

<Shamroc> t
<RustyMeat> Sagas is trolling hard
<Obsidian> Shizuka: Sadly wont be here for that :(
<Bronysith> sagas: in the prequels the lightsaber battles were all choreographed bullshit and felt more like dancing instead of actual sword fighting. there was no tension. luke vs vader was so good because you could tell luke was a novice fighter
<Darf14> Alien!
<DocSane> That 1992 CGI...
<Arteza147> Open the pod bay doors.
<Ponies47> ALIENS! :o
<SirGanjalf> That's how I imagine "Meet the Pyro"

<Bronysith> sagas: and in attack of the clones. Jango fett was hired to kill the senator. He pays anotehr assasin to assassinate the senator. The assassin could disguise herself as any species ever and disguised her face with a scarf as well
<A11ectis> That took awhile for him to die.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now he figured out how to make them work.
<Darf14> Plan Failure Failed
<sagas> Arteza147: Im afraid I cant do that
<devildog> thier gonna drown
<Ponies47> ^
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dat religious music
<Evenprime> nothing works, but fire fighting system does?
<Shizuka> 13if they did more damage at once to get me below 60.. i'd probably still be powering through since i know where everything is..
<Spriggals> To be continued...
<R-Dash5000> 8:25/7:25c nao.

<Lamp> IDK?
<Shamroc> BAD IDEA!
<Spriggals> DED
<Meanwhile> Great. You let the lunatic loose.
<SirGanjalf> "The crazy guy told of their return. But no one wanted to believe"

<Ponies47> Hey cachi01 :)
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: He should stop startin' the slag.
<DocSane> Thanks, crazy guy. Problem was almost solved.
<GabeMoist> I am the moistest of aliens
<Bronysith> sagas: anytime theres any character development, its 2 sometimes 3 characters either walking down a hall, one stops and turns around to say something. Then the other is when they are sitting on a couch. that is it
<Obsidian> Order? Die
<cachi01> hi WallDives Jim Canadian_Brony devildog ZappyTheUnicorn and Ponies47 :)
<Meanwhile> And then it ate him.
<Bronysith> sagas: in the prequels
<Ponies47> cachi01: :)

<Ponies47> ded
<Spectrum_Plush> INB4 the ending:S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why does this guy want to be killed?
<sagas> Bronysith: New technology. Animatronics were the best at the time.
<DocSane> Bwa-hahahaa
<Darf14> Dead
<SirGanjalf> dat cgi
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Slag should stopped startin'
<WallDives> cachi01, cool.
<Obsidian> dat bad CGI
<Arteza147> Motherfucker deserves to die.
<Greth206> Wow, that looked horrible.
<Cypresswolf> I shall call her - Queen Crysalis
<DocSane> Nothing ages as poorly as bad early CGI.
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf: :D
<sagas> Bronysith: Now its cgi
<Bronysith> sagas: animatronics are more impressive than any bullshit CGI cause it requires creativity. now you just pay a guy a shitzillion dollars to make it
<Evenprime> so what?
<Shamroc> PONY SWAG!
<devildog> Lamp u doin that stayin up thing taht toomey set up
<dalekkahn> Wayland corp needs to start stopping. Those slags
<Canadian_Brony> afk
<Midnight_Fyre> Bronysith: truth
<Hat> same thing?
<Lamp> devildog, Yeah bro.
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: tell them to stop starting
<Lambo> I don't like the alien franchise in general (although I do like Alien and Aliens)
<Bronysith> Midnight_Fyre: TY MY BRONY /)
<Darf14> err... same thing black dude
<Jim> Teenie weenie
<sagas> Bronysith: The cgi is still made by artists. It allows them more freedom than the animatronics
<Jim> teehe
<Arteza147> my dick................
<devildog> same here :)
<ponibas> hey all
<Lambo> It is just stupid. "Oh, and HERE is another dumb reason why we have another Alien movie."
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: you tell them to stop startin'

<Shamroc> Meanwhile: stop starting ye slag..

<Meanwhile> Shamroc: yer mums a slag.
<cachi01> hi ponibas!
<Lamp> I love you Ponibas!
<Ponies47> ponibas: Sorry I derped :P
<Bronysith> sagas: noooo. its all bullshit excuse for the director to shove as much bullshit as he/she can in the movie as possible, it is incredibly suffocating
<Cypresswolf> :P We've got a itty bitty little little twinkie pinkie problem
<Arteza147> cachi01: The other ones dont exist to me..........
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: ye mums a slag....so is ye siblings..if you got any...also STOP STARTING
<ponibas> I wish lamp had derped... oO
<Darf14> This movie needs more Game over Man! Game Over
<Jim> ^
<cachi01> Arteza147: just imagine they are fanfics lol
<devildog> i love every pony
<Bronysith> sagas: just because you can do something doesnt mean its a good idea
<Greth206> In the future, everyone's British. Except for women.
<Hat> Working as a unit
<Lamp> Tee Hee!
<Ponies47> devildog: dawwww :)
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Yer a slag.
<Midnight_Fyre> Thius movie is giving me a headache

<Lamp> devildog, I love you...
<FairysHuff> Welcome to the human race. Where everyone is out for no1
<Shamroc> and he should stop starting
<A11ectis> One Welsh guy
<SirGanjalf> SHADDAP! I'm trying to think
<Ponies47> I came in late so I've missed most of the movie :P
<cachi01> this headache is giving me a movie
<Sakari> devildog: Love you too :)
<Obsidian> So much talking. Not enough killing
<sagas> Bronysith: The cgi allows for the directors to have greater freedom and scale. With cgi you arent as limited to what you can do
<Bronysith> sagas: I CAN take a syringe and remove the creme from a cadbury egg and inject it with ranch dressing. Still doesnt mean its a good idea
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Bronysith: oh god
<devildog> love u Lamp
<RustyMeat> that sounds amazing Bronysith
<Lamp> Mmmmm devildog
<SirGanjalf> Bronysith: Sounds like a good prank
<Bronysith> sagas: again. i have the freedom to blow my brains out. still not a good idea
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf: i did it before
<ROHKARA> Is it wrong that I find an arguement over the Star Wars prequals more entertaining than the actual movie
<cachi01> Bronysith: wooow its not a good idea? i wa splaninng on doing it this weekend
<devildog> mmmmmmmm Lamp
<Canadian_Brony> I haz Filly Rainbow Dash headphones
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony: /)
<Hat> 2x fast forward with subtitles would make movie better
<Lamp> devildog...(sexy voice)
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith (\
<Sakari> Canadian_Brony: Im jelly :(
<cachi01> what Hat said
*Nittany_Discord 11,01cycles
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT now knows what "slag" means and will not use it.
<sagas> Bronysith: The syringe is like the cgi. You can use it to inject ranch or you can use it to inject something better. All the syringe (cgi
<devildog> hehehe u making me blush :$
<Shamroc> LOL
<sagas> ) does is give you greater freedom
<Arteza147> Its a queen.
<Canadian_Brony> btw, what I miss?
<Shamroc> darn caps lock
<Diglett> ...
<Diglett> spoiler
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: LE GASP! THAT'S AWESOME! :o
<sagas> to flavor your cadberry eggs how you wish
<Lamp> Ohhh devildog!
<Sakari> Uh oh
<devildog> mmmm lamp
<JESmith71> Bronysith: Well they did was last year they updated Star Tiurs and they changed the ride film and it now has several different scenes and which ones you see are random everytime you ride. Like you'll either go to Hoth and fight AT-ATs, go to Tatooine and do a podrace, or go to Kashyyyk and do a speeder bike chase. Then you get a message from either Akbar, Yoda, and Leia (They got Carrie Fisher to do the new lines!). Then you get the fimal scene wher
<Meanwhile> Aaaaaah fudge.
<Shamroc> dat alien
<Ponies47> SO MUCH TEXT 6_9
<Lamp> Faster devildog!
<Obsidian> dat wall
<Ponies47> :o

<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 they are Philips Customer Design Headphones
<Darf14> aww shes preganant, The alien father would be proud.......wait when did she.....bah! Never MIND! >_<
<Meanwhile> It looks like it's really ugly.
<JESmith71> ...maybe I should have PM'ed him that
<sagas> I KNEW IT! I CALLED IT! THATS WHY IT DIDNT KILL HER!
<xmasskills> eugh
<Lamp> Dat devildog
<cachi01> congratulations its a xenomorph!!!!!!
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Nice! :)
<Arteza147> sagas: But its even more than that........
<Hat> I can't see it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She's going to have a kid.
<Meanwhile> Ah bollocks.
<Jim> Expecting a baby, getting an xenomorph
<sagas> Arteza147: How so?
<Bronysith> sagas: The OT shot on location and took timing and used models for the ships and stuff. it was awesome. the plot was fantastic and had lovable characters. The Prequels soley relied on cg to attempt and fail to impress the massives. no characters or plot whatsoever, it was all rushed so that they could get vader in the suit
<Sumica> 00,10no wonder she has been so hormonal
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: care to tell me what it means?
<Lambo> Bad Luck Ripley
<devildog> Dat Lamp
<Arteza147> sagas: Do you mind spoilers much?
<Midnight_Fyre> time to get an alien abortion
<Darf14> WHen the hay did she had alien sex
<Lamp> Ohh baby.
<JESmith71> Or broke it up into several message
<ponibas> mazal tof!
<JESmith71> s
<Bronysith> OGOD
<sagas> Arteza147: wait then
<DocSane> Every damned Alien movie since this one ends up as a weird ass abortion metaphor.
*Bronysith dies
<Ponies47> So much saying of the word (squee) :O
<Lambo> Lock yourself in the vault
<Hat> Guard will let us know by screaming
<Meanwhile> No air conditioning. Good thinking.
*Bronysith regenerates into the 43rd Bronysith
<Jim> I call zombie bullshit
<devildog> Lamp u my baby
<Arteza147> sagas: You have chosen....... wisely
<Cypresswolf> Inb4 the alien bursts out dancing the Michigan Rag
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> I dont think shit
<ponibas> kill the host!!!
<SirGanjalf> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> depends but basicly: "Slut"
<Canadian_Brony> no AC? I hope they don't have a hot summer
<Lamp> devildog You is my daddy.
<Shamroc> oh..makes sense
<Ponies47> Bronysith: HOW MANY OF THERE ARE YOU!?! :o
<RustyMeat> FUCKED
<sagas> I wonder if she got pregnant with the docs kid? hybrid maybe?
<Cypresswolf> Stabby Stabby
<Meanwhile> Well, you're focked then.
<Hat> I think the vault can be opened from the outside, so they can't hide in it
<cachi01> if i drinked a cup of vodka every time they say fuck i would have been dead by now
<A11ectis> Newt seemed to do pretty well.
<ponibas> it was 108 today... if I didn't have AC.. I'd kill someone
<devildog> son
<Jim> Someone should count how many times the word "fuck" is used in this movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also it was the name of a transformer and an insult used by transformers
<Bronysith> Ponies47: well your the 47th incarnation of Ponies right?
<Ponies47> ^
<Cypresswolf> Game Over, Man! Game Over!
<Shamroc> that i get...
<Meanwhile> Slag is also the term for molten metal.
<Everlasting_Joy|Derp> Howdy y'all.
<Ponies47> Bronysith: idk :P
<Jim> hi Everlasting_Joy
<Canadian_Brony> Jim I've got 4 already, and I came in 5 minutes ago
<Everlasting_Joy|Derp> My chat derpped on me.
<Arteza147> GET TO THA FURNACE!!!!!!11
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: :<
<Hat> Let's assemble everyone one area without question, then plan where we want to go
<Obsidian> Fire solves everything
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is also a programming lenguage
<Canadian_Brony> 5
<SirGanjalf> cachi01: Try this with Scarface. You'll be dead in the first quarter of the movie
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: hi man. i was right. i had to regenerate to continue to explain the shit prequels to sagas
<Canadian_Brony> 6
<Midnight_Fyre> Jim: I saw this when I was about 8 years old. It was one of my first memories of the word fuck
<Ponies47> 63524
<ponibas> hat, so does a nuke! ^.^
<cachi01> SirGanjalf: lol
<Shamroc> ....TO MANY MEANINGS
<devildog> hi Everlasting_Joy
<Darf14> lets all go to the furnace
<Everlasting_Joy|Derp> Bronysith: :D
<Cypresswolf> Charge! GO GO GO!
<Barbetos> I have a switch in my house that is labeled Furnace. I have no idea what it does and its really ominous. =P
<Arteza147> We must nuke them from orbit.
<Sumica> 00,10they wont kill it.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm gonna stop counting in-chat. I'll get kicked for excessive ping
<R-Dash5000> 8:40/7:40c nao.
<Meanwhile> We have the technology.
<SirGanjalf> We can rebuild him
<Jim> We can rebuild him, we have the technology
<sagas> Bronysith: I believe you have a rose colored view of the OT and a tinted view of the prequals
<Canadian_Brony> 7 . . . DAMMIT!
<Meanwhile> Fuck you.
<Obsidian> Freeze her today! They have the technology.
<Ponies47> R-Dash5000: eeyup. 7:40 PM here :)
<Lambo> lol http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/06/13/oho-max-payne-3-cheaters-forced-to-play-against-other/
<Midnight_Fyre> I think this may have been the first R rated film I ever saw that wasn't edited for TV
<Hat> It won't really kill everything, only these guys don't have weapons
<Spectrum_Plush> Barbetos: its probably used to turn on a furnace
<Ponies47> The code the code! :O
<Arteza147> afk
<Barbetos> I don't have a furnace to my knowledge =P
<RustyMeat> Ripley dont give a fuck about your wife and child
<Darf14> The Password is Password
<Obsidian> Lambo: They get what they deserve
<Lamp> Daddy! You need to find me a mommy!
<Canadian_Brony> 10
<Bronysith> sagas: well i feel im talking with a guy who soley relies on graphics for a game to tell the story and is in no way impressed by depth of gameplay. you are such a COD and BF3 fan
<Cypresswolf> Give up the CODE :[
<Meanwhile> Yeah, there's no way a dad is going to overlook his kid for anyone elses sake.
<Meanwhile> Fuck you and your aliens.
<Kipkat07_Mare> Free Hat!!
<devildog> Lamp im trying somewhat
*Canadian_Brony takes the hat
<Hat> Where?!!?
<SirGanjalf> Lambo: http://affordablehousinginstitute.org/blogs/us/wp-content/uploads/brilliant_681.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10Ripply is selfish
<Lamp> Awh! Who is gonna be my mommy?
<cachi01> Lambo: wow rockstar is a genius
<Spectrum_Plush> Barbetos: if your house is relatively old it might have had one in the past now though its probably redundent
<Bronysith> sagas: there are 2 types of people in this world. People who are intelligent and creative whom love to actually work hard with their hands to make aweosme stuff. then there are people who like the star wars prequels
<sagas> Bronysith: Those fans are the same as you with rose colored lenses
<Cypresswolf> :O She's carrying Queen Crysalis
<Om> I don't think this is how she pictured parenthood.
<CriticKitten> Dat metaphor
<Meanwhile> Sumica: well the aliens have pretty much been responsible for the death of everyone she loved.
<devildog> Lamp idk
<Barbetos> Spectrum_Plush yeah its old, so that make sense.
<Bronysith> sagas: actually the prequels did have a plot

<Wrek> 05the doom movie in itself is completly all right
<otakon> Diglett:no, not in Aliens it wasn't. Body shots and lots of them goddammit. Also, I doubt the destructive power of a bullet is equal to being SUBMERGED IN BUCKING MOLTEN LEAD>
<Om> NEXT prisoner!

*ponibas hides from sagas
<Red_Pegasus> Suddenly...
<otakon> Diglett: I'm just saying, it's REALLY inconsistent on how strong the exoskeleton is on these things is all. Normal gunfire is capable of killing them, the vacuum of space can kill them, Predator blades can kill them, yet being submerged in molten lead for a good 15 seconds can't....
<DocSane> R-Dash5000: Japan?

<sagas> killerpony7733: I think I will get up and drink exactly that
<DocSane> killerpony7733: True, but it's not that guys don't like cute, just that they are discouraged from ever publicly admitting it.
<Litwick> A friend of mine is about to be kicked out of her girlfriend's house because she "doesn't have a job" even though she's tried to get one multiple times.
<Reikim> otakon: I heard you like Scott Pilgrim Music. /)

<Meanwhile> Litwick: jobs aren't easy to come by right now. Way uncool.
<Reikim> otakon: Anamanaguhi kicks ass.
<Crono_brony> So i heard that i like scott pilgrim music as well... oh wait... this isn't how it works!
<DocSane> Much of the anti-Brony backlash comes from people who are disturbed by the idea on non-gay guys liking something "girly".
<cachi01> anamanaguchi is best chiptune band
<TheRareP0N3> ...LOL.
<otakon> cow334: ah, Another Winter my fav song besides Rox 500 and Mid Boss Track

<TheSpitFirecolt> this is awesome shizuka
<flutter_spin> lol
<RAWRity> otakon: now now, we don't call them newbies anymore. We call them blank flanks.
<Bronysith> otakon: FOOL the stone cutters are bronies
<cachi01> Shizuka: nice mix =D
<Litwick> Alright everybody, if I could have your heads for one last time.
<BuckWheat> I'm not in denile. I just like to enjoy the show with moderation!
<hen3ry> No, the Stone Cutters created 3.5
<Bronysith> Litwick: yes?
<otakon> Bronysith: leave him be, if he doesn't want the label "Brony" we won't force it on him.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Implication is that every brony has a cutie mark. What's yours?
<ponibas> this music doeesn't go with the manga i am reading! =p
<Bronysith> otakon: fine

<killerpony7733> BuckWheat look at me i have seen the show since about episode 10 and up and been here for almost a year i think still don't see myself as a brony :P
<Litwick> A friend of mine is going through some (and by some I mean A LOYAL SHIT TON) of trouble.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai TheSpitFirecolt :)
<otakon> the hell updates, STOP MEDDLING WITH MY MONITOR
<sagas> BuckWheat: If you embrace it wholly, it feels great
<Shizuka> 13couple minutes more~
<Eddmario> @SuperBrony64 and how would I do that?
<Ponies47> *EXPLODES*
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: you are in a chat full of bronies. You are on a site called "Bronystate". Your username IS A PONY PUN. It's time to come out of the stable.
<otakon> Litwick: what's wrong?
<cachi01> Litwick: damn what happened?
<sagas> killerpony7733: You in denile too?
<flutter_spin> Especially watching the show in the Trollestia streams on youtube. Those are awesome
<ponibas> mixes are good :)

*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuka
<Darf14> well im off everypony CYA :)
<BuckWheat> Huh? This name I chose a name off the top of my head.
<Litwick> She needs some help. As in money help. Shje's doing a commission stream and will only ask for $5 for each "chibi pony" she draws.
<otakon> RAWRity: works for me
<killerpony7733> sagas nope i know my mind i choose not to see myself as a brony

<BuckWheat> Didn't know it was a Pony referenc e
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Darf14: Dream of ponies
<sagas> RAWRity: I thought that was clopping?
<ponibas> Arpeture SCience!!
<killerpony7733> sagas you aren't a brony if you don't want to me
<RAWRity> If pagans can call it "coming out of the broom closet" we can make our own version.
*ponibas swoons for Shizuka's music
<killerpony7733> sagas be*
<otakon> Litwick: dude, if I could I would but I'm broke. I can't help I can only wish them luck.

<Shizuka> 13er FTW
<cachi01> lol
<Reikim> Oh god we're discussing the philosophy of being a brony.
<flutter_spin> I think asking the question 'are you a brony' means you are one
<RAWRity> BTW, been watching season 2 of "Community". THE PAINTBALL EPISODE WAS AMAZING.
<Eddmario> FTS = For the suck?
<cachi01> oooh now i can recognize it thx Shizuka :)
<R-Dash5000> 10/9c/7p now.
<flutter_spin> But let me see if I can pull that brony pic again
<SaxyPretender> 0,14all right folks, if you can spare a couple of bucks to help someone out, head here please: http://www.livestream.com/sheepyichigo
<RAWRity> If only season 4 of Community wasn't guaranteed to suck.
<Barbetos> You know your a brony when you don't go a day without checking EQD?
<killerpony7733> sagas i don't see myself as want and don't want to be one i am on the borderline of being one but i choose not to identify myself as one besides MLP FIM isn't in my mind 24/7
<RoboGerbil> hey i got a question; for renting an apartment, is a $1200 move in fee (includes deposit, pet fee, parking, administration) and $665/mo a good deal?
<Bronysith> Barbetos: i just log onto bronystate
<killerpony7733> sagas as one*
<DogDog> RAWRity: So I hear u liek mudkipz
<Barbetos> Bronysith sub EQD with Bronystate. I see no difference.
<RAWRity> RoboGerbil: depends on how bit the apartment is, and if utilities are covered.
<Shizuka> 13remember, if rent is more than a third of your income, you can't afford it
<RAWRity> *big
<Bronysith> Barbetos: i just love ponies and the whole brony community
<DocSane> All right, I gotta bounce. Later, all you crazy kids.
<Obsidian> Bye DocSane
<sagas> killerpony7733: You dont have to have it on your mind 4/7 to be a brony.What are you afraid of to stop you from calling yourself a brony? What makes you not want the title?
<cachi01> mlp fim is in my mind the 24/7 with rock, metal, chiptune and videogames in its side
<sagas> *24/7
<BuckWheat> What's EQD?
<cachi01> BuckWheat: equestria daily
<Shamroc> ....oh this should be fun
<BuckWheat> Oh.
<Reikim> Shizuka gives us all a life lesson.

<Shamroc> Shizuka: nope
<Eddmario> Toonami?\
<Kencolt> Equestria Daily. Internet Crack for Bronies.
<RoboGerbil> RAWRity: its 1142 sq ft, incluides trash, internet, tv, gas
<killerpony7733> sagas i don't want to see myself as one and i lack a ambition to wanting to see myself as one, as i said if someone doesn't want to be a brony or see themselfs as one its their choice
<sagas> DocSane: I know but its just a descriptive term. YOu dont have to live up to any standard exept enjoying the show
<DocSane> sagas: I'm someone who likes the show and the fandom a lot, but being a "Brony" for me is like being a "Trekkie". It implies an unhealthy level of fandom to me.
<RAWRity> RoboGerbil: what about water?
<Red_Pegasus> AWWWW YEAH
<DogDog> RAWRity: u liek mudkipz?
<Litwick> Alright, thank you Saxy for helping.
<cachi01> killerpony7733: a brony is a teen that watches and enjoys MLP
<RoboGerbil> i gotta pay water, electric and something else...
<BuckWheat> Oh, so it's a pony information site.
<Shizuka> 13when we last joined our heroine, she had stopped a distress signal from going out and made her CO really mad

<Litwick> Even though we haven't had a viewer jump yet, it's still very thoughtful of you.
<ponibas> lol, for shame Shizuka
<Red_Pegasus> Cachi01: (Or a adult)
<DocSane> cachi01: And not being a teen, that especially doesn't describe me.
<Kencolt> cachi01: Um... not just a teen. I'm absolute proof of that.
*Bronysith gives Shizuka a valyriaan steel katana
<cachi01> Red_Pegasus: yeah or an adult
<sagas> killerpony7733: I understand that you dont want to identify as one, but Im wondering what underlying reasons are causing you to feel that way.
<Shizuka> 13aaaand cue bridge collapse!
<otakon> I always equated a brony to ": A older fan of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series and it's associated fan works of stories/music/art.
<CCCP> i like ponies
<cachi01> Kencolt: how old are?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: WOOO]

<Reikim> That awkward moment
<Greth206> Only thing wrong with this game is no Dwayne Johnson. :V
<Kencolt> Yeah. Otakon calls me "The Elder" sometimes. ^_^
<Reikim> So awkward
<BuckWheat> So, since Brony is a portmanteau of Bro and Pony. Does that make me a Sisony?
<killerpony7733> sagas Hard to tell i kinda just don't want to see myself as one i simply don't somewhere in my head it says that aloud
<Obsidian> Beat the boomer
<DogDog> Bronysith: well... i have some news.
<Reikim> BuckWheat: Nope, still a brony. We don't discriminate.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: remind me after this
<Shizuka> 13there's a review of d3 source code
<Shizuka> 13blew my mind
<BuckWheat> Oh,
<Bronysith> DogDog: shes right behind me!?
<otakon> BuckWheat: well, some of the female fans came to call themselves Pegasisters
<R-Dash5000> Do you stream new korra episodes live when they air?
<DocSane> ponibas: That makes me feel less like a creeper for hanging around here.
<otakon> oh crap REVENANT!
<BuckWheat> Ah.
<Greth206> BuckWheat: I've heard Pegasister thrown around.
<ponibas> lmao
<Kencolt> BuckWheat: No, you're a Brony also-- unless you prefer a feminine title, in which Pegasister is the most common.
<RaveBrony> So sleepy, Im gonna head to bed... Good night everypony!! Behave yourselves!:)
<otakon> R-Dash5000: sadly no, but Sumica usually streams them the day after
<dinky> Pegisister is sometimes called that, But brony is a unisex term
<DogDog> Bronysith: No, no. She's ded.

<otakon> night RaveBrony sleep well
<killerpony7733> sagas i techinally do what alot of bronies do and what not but the title doesn't tell me anything it has no meaning to me
<DocSane> I wish this sort of fandom had existed when I was in high school.
<flutter_spin> yeah, some girls like "pegasister" but really, brony is sort of 'like ponies'
<Reikim> Hey Alister.
<R-Dash5000> Head over to BronyTV this saturday at 11 am EST for a livestreamed episode of Korra. No offense Bronystate.

<flutter_spin> ....so much awesome that avatar
<R-Dash5000> But not live.
<Bronysith> Alister: right
<hen3ry> I want someone to turn down the temperature a bit. Grr.
<Kencolt> BuckWheat: The way I have it figured is, any male who wants to call himself a Brony is a Brony. And any female who wants to call herself a Brony is a Brony. And any female who wants to call herself a Pesister is a Pegasister. And any male who wants to call himself a pegasister is... suspect, buw okay...
<otakon> DogDog: look up "Otakon is shipped with everything" on youtube... though you MIGHT need a link.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, R-Dash5000, no advertising other streams without permission

<R-Dash5000> Oh.
<Alister> Reikim: Yeah, Turned out he liked another girl with the same name. It was my mistake on this one
<flutter_spin> lol Kencolt
<cachi01> dat HAHAHAHAHHA
<CCCP> killerpony7733: yup :3
<CCCP> hi flutter_spin *nomz*
<BuckWheat> I mean, was asking like if I WAS a brony. Hypothetically.
<flutter_spin> hey CCCP. Just checking in during my fanfic rewrite break
<Reikim> Alister: Facehoof first, then laugh and thank Celestia that it didn't turn out worse.
<Alister> Reikim: Anyway , have you completed your first game of Human Revolution ?
<Kencolt> BuckWheat: If you want to be.
<ponibas> lol, Saxy and Wrek watchin him
<Greth206> dat shotgun.
<Red_Pegasus> Why no you save shotgun ammo?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14say wha
<CCCP> flutter_spin: oh cool, can u link it when its done? :)
<Obsidian> BuckWheat: You call call youself one but you dont have to, but its nothing to be ashamed of here
<Reikim> Alister: No, not yet. I just finished the fight at Eliza. I couldn't beat it until the boss glitched up and stood there doing nothing while I shot her to death.
<BuckWheat> I do Like the show, but the term Brony just makes me feel kinda uncomfortable right now. I don't know. I have to wait and see.
<killerpony7733> love dat plasma rifle the way it fires sounds orgasmic <3
<DogDog> I heer u liek mudkipz RAWRity
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/suywx
<Kencolt> As the present stream shows, we're not ENTIRELY about pastel colored equines in a magical kingdom that occiasionally has huge amounts of nightmare fuel injected, only mostly.
<flutter_spin> lol. I usually post each chapter when I finish, but yeah. It is rough around grammar, but the additional narrative makes it better
<Reikim> Kencolt: Except on new episode days.
<Eddmario> Have you gotten the BFG yet?
<Kencolt> Reikim: Yeah, true that...
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Um. Did you just say you skip the editing phase?
<killerpony7733> CCCP steampunk augmented rainbow dash :O
<Alister> Reikim: yeah , that fight was a pain in the ass if you took sneaking augs. Square Enix outsourced the boss fights to another developer than Eidos and it really shows
<DocSane> Kencolt: But those pony girls are never too far from our thoughts.
<CCCP> killerpony7733: l:D
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/ES6ZA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, that big guy with the wheelchair is called a Pinkie right?
<Kencolt> DocSane: Also true, albeit for many reasons.
<Reikim> Alister: I noticed. Barret was a pain in the ass until I looked up a guide.
<flutter_spin> Reikim: ...sort of. I am re-editing if that counts.
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: correct
<killerpony7733> CCCP excited spike?
<CCCP> i like Pinkie Pie
<CCCP> killerpony7733: i guess
<hen3ry> I like Cherry Pi... oh! oh yeah.
<killerpony7733> ;)
<Litwick> Alright, I'm loging off to try and calm myself down after what's happened.
<DocSane> Kencolt: I really need to host a panel about why people are drawn tot he show.
*WindWhistler is ridiculously bored...
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Re-editing?

<killerpony7733> Litwick take care then :)
<Eddmario> http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD http://derpy.me/kVLJD
<Om> Punching don't work that well xD
<Bronysith> Litwick: its okay
<Bronysith> Litwick: what happened?
<Phase4> 00,02why dont you shoot the fat guys?
<Bronysith> Phase4: boomers
<flutter_spin> In otherwords, I changed my story ever so slightly. Whatever phases I went through is still there. I just added more context
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Alister> Reikim: Let me give you a tip for the final boss , in advance. Save a laser gun for it and take the invisibility aug. Then you can shoot trough the window while being invisible from across the room. it's way easier that way
<WindWhistler> Oh, looks like I missed something.
<DocSane> Kencolt: I have a number of theories, from empathy for the characters to many fans wanting them to be their imaginary girlfriends.
<Litwick> Bronysith: I'll let someone else say what happend. I'm too distressed right now to say.
<Bronysith> Litwick: okay. i am with you, share your pain with me
<cachi01> Phase4: if i have learn something about shooting fat guys in horror shooters is that they always explode or leave something nasty on its way
<Greth206> That "night-vision" really sucks...
<killerpony7733> cachi01 doom 3 fat zombies don't explode or anything
<Alister> DocSane: That's ridiculous.
<Obsidian> Well I gotta shut down. Night everypony!
<Shamroc> Eddmario: can you stop spamming those...
<killerpony7733> Shizuka careful
<DocSane> Alister: Is it?
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/ZkcvG
<Kencolt> DocSane: IN my case-- it's just a fun show, an interesting universe, and well... I wish to HECK I'd had the study habits of Twilight Sparkle when I was younger. I'd be a freaking millionaire.
<Shizuka> 13cause they're more fun to punch~
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Well, whatever that is, I have to tell you now to never, EVER post anything un-edited. And try to get a prereader. Or someday I will fail to resist the urge to strangle you through chat.
<Alister> DocSane: To me and a good bunch of people here ,yes
<WindWhistler> Shizuka: What, do their bellies jiggle if you punch them?
<killerpony7733> CCCP dat daring do ;)
<CCCP> :3
<RAWRity> f
<Kencolt> At the least it saves on ammo.
<otakon> Shizuka: punch ALL the demons/zombies?
<cachi01> demons
<DogDog> RAWRity: u liek mudkipz?
<DocSane> Alister: I think the main appeal of the show is that the characters are relatable to people who are in their late teens and early 20's.
<otakon> WindWhistler: no, they go "Hoo hoo" like the Pillsbury Doughboy
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/dEyhv
<WindWhistler> otakon: LOL
<flutter_spin> lol. Trust me, its a lot better than the 1 day wall of text posts.
<otakon> argh mips STOP LAGGING
<Shizuka> 13i love this video
*DogDog ships otakon
<CCCP> Shizuka: what video?
<Alister> DocSane: just a question for me personally. 16 is considered early or late teen ?
<otakon> DogDog: I should warn you shipping me excessively is a bannable offense.
<cachi01> CCCP: the maintenaincree security video
<CCCP> oh :P
<BlueFlareon> 02Hi Chimera :3
<otakon> and mips lag again
<Barbetos> So many signs
<flutter_spin> But its already posted and people already read it. Whatever I add sort of doesn't matter at this point.
<DocSane> Alister: That's edging into late, but it's technically mid-teens
<killerpony7733> It's just one big lie
<DogDog> otakon: O RLY?
<killerpony7733> :D
<Shizuka> 13it's a great lampshade on the world design
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat green goo
<Om> Vent? Steam?
<Om> Gasp!
<DocSane> Alister: But many of the stories involve dealing with alienation and finding your place in the world.
<Shizuka> 13since there's steam vents EVERYWHERE
<Shizuka> 13and green goo because... goo sounds funny
<Barbetos> lol
<Iron_Edge> Green goo is best goo! =D
<otakon> DogDog: yes really, please believe me since you'll get an hour ban if you do it excessively
<Shizuka> 13and if you touch the goo you quarantine for a week
<otakon> Shizuka: nice, VERY nice
<Barbetos> confinement?
<BuckWheat> Do you guys know when Season 3 starts?
<Barbetos> Sounds fair.
<otakon> BuckWheat: this fall from reports
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/-AGd-
<killerpony7733> BuckWheat august september
<BuckWheat> Awesome.
<Shamroc> BuckWheat..hasnt been annoucned yet..well the specfic date
<Alister> DocSane: Well , the cutie mark is kinda a metaphor for self-identity discovery . so yes maybe
<Reikim> flutter_spin: I see a lot of unedited docs, and it shows. I might be a grammar nut, but anything that goes out unedited makes me want to headdesk. I don't care how good your grammar might be; I have near-flawless gramamr on first copies, but I STILL preread because it's always a good practice to do so at least twice.
<DocSane> Alister: The characters are all "adults" with responsibilities, but see themselves as emotionally immature, which is often how young adults see themselves.
<killerpony7733> Russian guy <3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat Russian guys
<RAWRity> You know what? MLP needs a Paintball episode.
<Barbetos> CCCP You are my favorite pony. I dunno why I feel that way, but I do. <3
<WindWhistler> dat accent
<Greth206> what do we know about S3?
<killerpony7733> SaxyPretender beat ya to it :D
<DogDog> otakon: so... u liek ships? whats your favorite kind? pirate ships?
<CCCP> PING?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he should say "Nuclear wessel"
<RAWRity> Greth206: that it has ponies.
<CCCP> DAMN chat derp
<RAWRity> that's about it.
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: It would be a banned episode I bet. Paintball games can be pretty violent. And dramatic.a
<CCCP> who pinged me? >_>
<otakon> DogDog: space ships, preferrably with massive main cannons and heavy armor.
<Greth206> RAWRity: That's enough for me! :V
<DocSane> Alister: So you character archetypes, like Twilight the constantly-stressed student, always worried about living up to expectations.
<Diglett> hi guys im back
<CCCP> hai RAWRity
<BronyCody> damn he is still playing doom 3 i checked 2 days ago and he was still palying this...
<CCCP> hi Diglett
<hen3ry> space pirates are best pirates
*sagas is back with a kit-kat bar "anybody want some?" :)
<Red_Pegasus> 'Pie'rates are best
<Reikim> Specifically, Metroid space pirates are best pirates.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Diglett> samus aran is best bount hunters
<WindWhistler> Red_Pegasus: Especially explosive Pierates.
<Bronysith> Reikim: would simon count as a space pirate? cause they did an epic battle in space
<DocSane> Alister: Or Rarity, who's constantly at war with her selfish tendencies for promoting herself and her business while wanting to do things to help her friends.
<Reikim> In other words, I finally beat Other M the other day. Post-credits content is the best part of the game.
<Barbetos> Quick investigate the clicky noise!
<killerpony7733> Barbetos spiders? :O
<Kencolt> DocSane: Now that I can't quite agree with. They don't see themselves as immature-- I doubt Pinkie Pie would even understand the concept-- but they are young adults, and so have tolearn that they have maturation to go. Just like anyone else.
<Alister> DocSane: Ok , I know the characters
<DogDog> otakon: so if i put you in a space ship and send it to the moon, then its against the rules?
<Bronysith> Barbetos: its a pipe bomb
<killerpony7733> Yay spiders! :D
*sagas feels like he came back to a very in-depth discussion and is lost
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Reikim, I ask that you not spoil. I plan on some day eventually playing Other M, and until then I stay away from all story info. >.<
<DocSane> Kencolt: They often feel out of their depth, though.
<WindWhistler> I got the impression the mane six were in their early 20's...
<Barbetos> Bronysith Harry Potter Puppet Pals reference? =P
<killerpony7733> sagas huh still waiting on ya reply
<Alister> sagas: you startin' ?
<Kencolt> DocSane: And who doesn't?
<WindWhistler> Rarity has her own business after all
<Bronysith> Barbetos: indeed /)
<Barbetos> \(
<Alister> sagas: your mum's a slag
<Barbetos> (\
<sagas> Alister: I think I might be
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: No problems. Just telling you that 1) The story is polarizing, and 2) it's a good idea to sit through the credits.
<DocSane> Kencolt: What I'm saying is these characters are very relatable for people who are on the threshhold of adulthood.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14will do
<Shizuka> 13btw
<killerpony7733> sagas you remember i said before you went brb?
<Shizuka> 13i've caught up with nittany
<Bronysith> Shizuka: good job /)
<Shizuka> 13this is where he was last i saw him stream d3
<Barbetos> So wut now?
<sagas> killerpony7733: Sorry I dont
<DocSane> Kencolt: The past pony series always portrayed them as children.
<BuckWheat> I think I most relate to Twilight Sparkle.
<DogDog> Smart to ignore.
<Alister> DocSane: I know , but I don't think I can personally relate to any of them
<BuckWheat> I didn't have a lot of friends growing up.
<Red_Pegasus> BuckWheat: I relate to Derpy.
<BuckWheat> I just stayed inside and read all day.
<DocSane> Alister: Really? I find that unusual.
<BuckWheat> Red_Pegasus: Oh yeah?
<DocSane> Alister: Do you have a favorite character?
<Shizuka> 13because now i get a rocket launcher
<Bronysith> Shizuka: bfg?
<Kencolt> DocSane: I think they are relatable to ANYONE-- but I get your point. What I'm saying is, we're watching them from outside-- and so, the characters don't see these flaws AS flaws until they are forced to learn about them as such--which is what people really relate to.
<Alister> My dilemma is that what passionates me is Politics and History. But I chose to go in Sciences wich I don't like as much. I need the money
<sagas> killerpony7733: What did you say?
<Red_Pegasus> BuckWheat: My favorite food are muffins.
<Barbetos> A rocket launcher that shoots RAINBOWS!!
<killerpony7733> sagas i techinally do what alot of bronies do and what not but the title doesn't tell me anything it has no meaning to me
*Bronysith slaps Alister
<Reikim> Shizuka: Let the rocket jumping BEGIN!
<Alister> DocSane: Well my favorite character is Twilight
<BuckWheat> Red_Pegasus: Nice x)
<killerpony7733> sagas thats what i said
<Alister> Bronysith: what's the ibg idea ?
<Shizuka> 13one sec
<DocSane> Alister: Very common. Why is she your favorite?
<Bronysith> Alister: a job you hate is a job not worth doing at all
<killerpony7733> also mancubus soon <3'
<Shizuka> 13spider building a web on my monitor..
<BuckWheat> Red_Pegasus: I prefer cupcakes.
<Barbetos> lol
<killerpony7733> Shizuka looool!
<Bronysith> Alister: go for your passion.
<Kencolt> DocSane: Where, we on the outside can instantly see "Oh, Snap, thyat was a MISTAKE, Rainbow!" and thus relate, see?
<Reikim> Alister: If you need money, go into nursing/medicine. If you don't mind the hellish work hours.
<Shizuka> 13anyway this is where nittany was last time
<Barbetos> Shizuka that was the sound of the clicking!
<CCCP> well night night everypony!!!! <3

<Randomnerd> STEMM is all that is hiring.

<Ponies47> Night CCCP :)

<Alister> Reikim: I could nerver go in medicine. I'm not good enough. But I can qualify for electrical enineering
<DocSane> sagas: Many people see Bronies as furries by a different name.

<Ponies47> BYE FOR NOW! :)
*CCCP nomz killerpony7733 Barbetos cachi01 Reikim cachi01 Ponies47 SaxyPretender sagas and Bronysith
<Randomnerd> I will tell my kids, if I'm fortunate enough to ever be a stable man fit to raise children, to not make the same mistake I did.
<Reikim> Alister: Electrician? Good choice. You can make craptons of money that way.
*hen3ry mutters something unkind about furries
<sagas> DocSane: I know. I dissagree with that assumtion though
<Alister> Bronysith: Passion and Dreams are great. But they can't help you raise a family
<DocSane> Reikim: Electrician is not the same as electrical engineering
<Kencolt> doc And of course, most people don't realise that the furry community operates on many different levels.
<DogDog> Randomnerd: i hope your kids don't know that their dad likes a show for little girlls
<killerpony7733> sagas its really just that i can't find a meaning in calling myself one i do everythine a brony do techinally but the title just can't really give me meaning
<Randomnerd> Furries are people. MLP has taught me to be less judgemental.
<Reikim> DocSane: I assume that's what he's aiming at.
<killerpony7733> Kencolt i'm a furry :D
<Red_Pegasus> DogDog:Can't tell if anti-brony...
<killerpony7733> Kencolt been one since 2009
<Bronysith> Alister: yes. but in the end, if you hate what you do. you might just kill yourself
<Alister> Reikim: Hydroelectrical engineer to be more precise. Those engineers in the north of Quebec make a crap ton more money than the south
<otakon> killerpony7733: argh that was info that you didn't need to share man. Nothing wrong with it really, but you didn't need to share it.
<DocSane> sagas: I think the difference is that furries are attracted to animal characters by their non-humanness. Bronies like the characters in spite of it.
<Kencolt> I used to be a furry cartoonist before I had a bout with BGS and kinda lost my fine control for drawing.
<Alister> Bronysith: I like Engineering. Just not as much as politics and history
<killerpony7733> otakon if you think so :D
<Reikim> Alister: Oh so true. Give it a couple years and they'll be supplying all of NA with hydro.
<DocSane> Kencolt: Sorry to hear that.
<Randomnerd> DogDog: I don't have kids. The mistake I made was picking a job that I LIKED, which will never pay well enough.
<BuckWheat> DogDog: The show is definitely not aimed at little girls haha. They've got a lot of references to some old/ mature stuff.
<HyperMetalLugia> !ping
<drfsupercenter> !pong
<Bronysith> Alister: as long as you dont despise it then okay
<otakon> argh, STUPID MIPS STOP LAGGING
<sagas> killerpony7733: You dont find it at all endearing? It doesnt give you a sense of being a part of a community?
<DocSane> sagas: I know an old school furry who hates MLP.
<cachi01> i liek mips cause its good to me
<WindWhistler> OH HI ARROGANT BASTARD
<Randomnerd> "Do what you love, and the money will follow" is stupid advice.
<Kencolt> Back in the heyday of Small Press Comics, when ANYONE could make an 8 page zine, I won two awards for my most noted title-- a little thing called Star Teddies.
<Red_Pegasus> DocSane: Kitty076?
<Randomnerd> You have to learn to love.
<WindWhistler> don't you just love those arrogant bastards in video games?
<Randomnerd> You have to learn to love your job, and learn to love who you're with.
<DocSane> Red_Pegasus: No. Someone I've known IRL for years and years.
<Alister> Bronysith: Also it kinda gives me an excuse to take engineering like my friend and my DEAR friend
<Phase4> 00,02Shizutank
<sagas> DocSane: I feel that furries like any anthropromorphic animal. Bronies just like specifically this show
<Bronysith> Alister: okay then
<killerpony7733> sagas i interact with the community and act like so many others but the calling myself a brony is to me meaningless since it's just a fancy word for saying fan of MLP FIM
<hen3ry> names are just names.
<Reikim> Alister: Dat DEAR.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Alister, taking engineering because your friends are taking it it's a bad idea
<Darkness_Pony> isnt this a horror game
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeyup
<cachi01> Darkness_Pony: it is
<Kencolt> Oh, well, got dailies to do. BBL, and enjoy watching someone play a FPS.
<DocSane> sagas: True, but I see anthropomorphic characters as animals who walk of two legs and act like humans in fursuits.
<killerpony7733> oh dear flying heads
<Diglett> sure(sarcasm
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Kencolt
<Thedude946z[Online]> Why does Phase4 have a + by his name?
<Alister> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I wanted to take it before I knew they'd take it too
<Greth206> You know, if you say to some "I'm a brony." they say "What?" with a blank look on their face. You then proceed to explain that you like MLP:FiM. Why not just start with "I like MLP:FiM"?
<Bronysith> Alister: incredibly bad idea man. you need to do something because YOU want to do it. NOT BECAUSE OF ANYONE ELSE
<Randomnerd> But yeah, never believe love just happens.
<Reikim> Night kencolt
<Diglett> Whats so scarry about it
<Phase4> 00,02Thedude946z[Online], it meens voice
<Thedude946z[Online]> oh
<sagas> killerpony7733: So you dont not want to be called a brony, but you dont want to be called one either? Are you indifferent?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Alister then it would be okay but really never do something only because of friends
<Alister> BronyCody: I explained I wanna doit for the money.
<DocSane> sagas: It's why I don't like fan art which draws the ponies on two legs.
<hen3ry> so.....
<HarrySack> Greth206: thats why you remain a closet brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're currently livestreaming a 30-minute art challenge at Bronyfunds.

<Alister> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: By that I meant, we might go to the same college
<Reikim> Art challenge?
<sagas> DocSane: I can agree with that. I also find humanized ponies undesireable
<BuckWheat> Randomnerd: I don't think it is.
<cachi01> Greth206: lol when i said to my friends i am a brony the said u are a what? and then i started explaining what a brony was and what mlpfim was and why i watched it
<Om> Why he want your soul?
<DocSane> sagas: See, I really love the humanized ones.
<RAWRity> as time goes on, I have the sneaking suspicion that my mother is trying to make me murder her.
<otakon> eh, I find nothing wrong with humanized ponies
<cachi01> Om: he lieks souls
<otakon> anthro ponies do freak me out a bit though

<HarrySack> otakon: umadbro?

<DocSane> Alister: Okay, why is Twi your favorite character?
<hen3ry> dat economy tho...
<RAWRity> First, it was playing episodes of "Big Bang Theory" every god damn night. Then it was yelling at the cat when he was in her way. Now, she's decided that 10:30 at night is the perfect time to try playing her "native american" drum that she ordered in the mail.
<Red_Pegasus> DocSane: See: My little pony tales.
<Randomnerd> Were I smart, I'd have gone into STEMM.
<sagas> DocSane: I know. I just find that making them human takes away from the innocence of the show.
<otakon> HarrySack: well when I can't watch the stream right I am.
<BuckWheat> Randomnerd: But that could happen to anyone, regardless of pursuing your dream or not.
<otakon> RAWRity: lol
<RAWRity> And every time she bangs on that fucking thing, I want to kill her just a tiny bit more.

<otakon> and then epic SHOTGUN TO FACE combat
<DocSane> To save ammo, I'm guessing

<WindWhistler> I'm so bored, so I'm just gonna throw things around the chat.
<Alister> DocSane: Twi is my favorite character because I too used to be intraverted and cynical. I opened up to some friends like her and it really was a good thing. Other than that , I just think I can realte to her by her OCD tendencies, her Modesty vs Trixie and other examples.
*WindWhistler throws SuperBrony64
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: not necessarily. Depends on what your dream is. I know a guy whose dream was to become the world's greatest drug dealer. And when he failed, he got gunned down over a bag of cocaine.

<WindWhistler> Aaaaaaaaaaah.....

<BuckWheat> RAWRity: Lol, well I mean your dream has to be rational and not Illegal.
<Reikim> Alister: Amen to that. Save for the modesty. I've been told that my ego can be quite vocal, but it's probably just to cover up my insecurities.

<cachi01> my goal is to be the very best and cathc them all!!!!
<DocSane> Alister: I think this is also one of the few shows that just portrays girls as people and not obsessed with "girl things."
<Alister> DocSane: But I try to see my problems as my own rather than compare them with cartoon characters
<cachi01> hi SunderlandPony89!
<otakon> Shizuka: and thus the PUGILIST EXCERCISE PROGRAM was born
<otakon> DocSane: well said
<otakon> hiya SunderlandPony89
<Spriggals> Pew pew pew
<SaxyPretender> 0,14seriously, I've got the Rocky theme in my head
<sagas> pew pew pew
<TheRareP0N3> RISE AND SHINE MR FREEMAN. RISE AND SHINE
<WindWhistler> Whenever I see someone say "ADRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAN", I always think of Sexy Commando Gaiden...but I know it's a reference to some movie.
<Reikim> Shizuka punching zombies is now a meme.
<cachi01> SaxyPretender: lol same here
<DocSane> Alister: Right, but identifying with a character doesn't demand emulation of them.
<otakon> Reikim: I can dig it
<Red_Pegasus> Adrian Shepard?
<SunderlandPony89> Shizuka X Fistfights?
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: I want to teach kids how to read, not be a menace to society.
<Diglett> hopfuly
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Gonna fly now
<RAWRity> otakon: the stallion bumps his featureless, smooth pelvis against the mare's equally featureless pelvis until the stork comes and gives them a little foal.
<Iron_Edge> SaxyPretender: -lol- ya' gots ta' eat thunder ta' crap lighnin!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<killerpony7733> sagas i can't feel a hidden reason for it i really don't think deeply into things
*WindWhistler grabs her gun
<Diglett> Red_pegasus: you played it too
*WindWhistler grabs a hunting rifle
<Reikim> RAWRity: Please, sir, you must have a brohoof for that. /)
<Alister> DocSane: true. One way they break sterotype is violence let me explain. In most shows , slap stick physical humour will happen to a male. But in this show, the Mane 6 get hurt alot. Twi is almost the show's official punching bag
<killerpony7733> yay babies
<cachi01> RAWRity: :o and thats how equestria was made?
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: menace? Drug dealers serve a big purpose in our entertainment industry. Who else can we have to be the bag guy in after school specials?
<RAWRity> Reikim: (\
<BuckWheat> Like becoming a Billionaire, possible? Yes, but highly improbable. But if you aim high enough, you might become a millionaire instead. Shoot for the moon, land on a star.
<sagas> killerpony7733: Well it is possible it is subconciouse. Part of you cant accept it. You might not know why
<DocSane> Alister: I think, in many ways, the media encourages the idea that there are these unscalable walls between genders. This show is unusual in that gneder has almost no bearing on anything.
<WindWhistler> BuckWheat: It's physically impossible to land on a star.
<Petrified_Discord> WindWhistler: Well, not for long.
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Hasn't stopped me.
<HarryDownUnder> RAWRity: there are kids on this site, that was unnessicary
<Red_Pegasus> TO THE SUN
<DocSane> Alister: Which is common in "boy shows" but almost unheard of in "girl shows."
<sagas> How much longer does she have left in this game?
<BuckWheat> Don't take it literally lol.
<Randomnerd> WindWhistler: Dwight, is that you?
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: or, you aim to become a billionaire but are so afwul at it, you end up completely broke and you hang yourself from the rafters of your shitty apartment.
<Diglett> indwhistler: what about kirby
<otakon> sagas: pretty sure she's near the end
<SunderlandPony89> I dont think I've ever heard a gun make a more blatent "Pew pew pew" sound that that one
<cachi01> TO URANUS!
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: Explain
<DocSane> Alister: Which, more often than not, wallow in their extreme girliness.
<WindWhistler> cachi01: I see what you did there
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: That's a risk you'll just have to take.
<Alister> DocSane: I always see people as individuals so I 100 % agree with that.
<RAWRity> because, as it turns out, finances are a little more difficult than aiming.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: and THAT is why id makes good shooters...except Rage that was kind of a let down didn't even look that good.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Alister> DocSane: Does saying that make me seen bi-sexual ?
<Alister> seemà*
<DocSane> Alister: No.
<Alister> seem*
<Greth206> How many babies were on this thing?
<killerpony7733> sagas i really really doubt emotionally i don't think theres a reason
<Spriggals> baby killer
<killerpony7733> mancubus
<Petrified_Discord> WindWhistler: Minor flammability issues :)
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Rage was pretty underwhelming considering Id's track record

<Shizuka> 13time for REALLY fat guy
<killerpony7733> :)
<otakon> Alister: no, unless you know you actually LIKE guys and girls
<cachi01> otakon: rage was not what i expected but men it sure take shit ton ¿s of GB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14zboomer!
<killerpony7733> Shizuka MANCUBUS!
<Greth206> punchies!
<otakon> cachi01: eeyup
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: There are those that see the obstacles and the improbabilities and back away, and there are those that gather ignorance and confidence, and sometimes succeed.
<RAWRity> If I could just fire myself out of a cannon and become a billionaire astronaut that can visit Luna whenever he wants, I'd do it.
<Petrified_Discord> Zombies, y u so FAT :(
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: Umm...you DO know how hot stars are, right?
<otakon> Shizuka: that is B WORD fat right there
<sagas> killerpony7733: Something is there and only you can know what
<Shizuka> 13do these cannons make my everything look fat?
<MahBoi777> Fat zombies are best zombies
<Alister> otakon: I can always make an exception for you ... and CupcakeWarrior
<cachi01> LOL
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: I may be being naive, but some of the greatest things in the world were accomplished by naive people.
<Diglett> Punchout VS Mr hippo
<SunderlandPony89> OH GOD KILL IT WITH FIRE
<otakon> Alister: no thanks, only into girls.
<sagas> its CTHULU!
<Om> Taaaake oooon meeeee (take on me)
<DocSane> Alister: So, anyway, I think another thing that male fans find appealing about this show is that it works to demystify girls as this mysterious "other" and present them as relatable across gender lines.
<PinkiePie2Cupcake2> it sounds like a cerberus or something
<WindWhistler> Besides, what could you DO on a star? It's just a ball of fire...not like the moon or anything.
<otakon> AW HELL NO LEVEL FATTY DETECTED!
<Alister> otakon: Too bad for you
<otakon> AW HELL NO DETECTED, DEPLOY PIES!
<Petrified_Discord> Maybe you can get them to diet first. Make 'em easier to kill?
<sagas> Is he teleporting or are there multiple?
<Randomnerd> Why do you send little baby men?
<Reikim> So...when did we bring bisexuality into this?
<otakon> sagas: multiples, the game likes to throw pairs at you
<killerpony7733> sagas even if there were i would share it with you but i know myself and i really just think i can't find a meaning to the title brony i just can't to me its that simple
<otakon> Reikim: no idea
<DocSane> (Can you all tell that I've been putting WAAAAY too much thought into analyzing this show?)
<Alister> DocSane: Yeah , I always was shy with the fairer sex , but since this year , I feel like I know my female friends a lot more
<otakon> Shizuka: no ammo! USE THE MACHINEGUN!
<Reikim> Man, I leave for five seconds - FIVE - and I come back and suddenly otakon is asserting his heterosexuality.
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: Do you have an answer for me?
<Alister> 499/500 ammo ''GUYS COVER ME ! I HAVE TO RELOAD''
<otakon> Reikim: what asserting? I like girls that's all I can say on that matter.
<otakon> Alister: lol
<Spriggals> Running out of ammo!!!
<Petrified_Discord> WindWhistler: I was making more of a joke, I didn't really think you would care this much, so why don't you just give my answer for me, 'kay? :)
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: I was thinking that, but I have a feeling that that thought is hypocritical considering how deep I try to analize videogames :P
<sagas> killerpony7733: Well are you parts of other non-brony communities on the internet?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Air scrubber?
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: no, some of the most hilarious things were accomplished by naive people. The important things in life were accomplished by people working long, hard hours and becoming the best they possibly could in their field of interest while making numerous sacrifices in order to accomplish even a modicum of what they set out to do.
<Alister> Reikim: He's doin g that because I was flirting with him
<killerpony7733> sagas i'm a furry for one
<otakon> FIRE ALL OF THE BULLETS
<Reikim> otakon: I wasn't even implying anything, so I'm going to apply some Freudian logic to that.
<RAWRity> Being optimistic and spouting yearbook quotes doesn't actually help you acomplish anything.
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: It was a joke? I couldn't tell. :/ Really, I don't care too much about the topic either, I was just making a point.
<RAWRity> Reikim: >Freud
<RAWRity> >Logic
<otakon> Reikim: okay... I have no idea what ya mean by that
<RAWRity> >HA
<Alister> otakon: You knouw you want it filly
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: But there were people who also ignored what society claimed was impossible and worked their hardest to make it possible.
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: I truly find this phenomenon fascinating because it's potentially very culturally significant.
<killerpony7733> Shizuka what the?
<Reikim> RAWRity: /) Now explain Freud to otakon here.
<Spriggals> 123
<Petrified_Discord> RAWRity: "Logic merely allows one to be wrong with authority."
<sagas> killerpony7733: Well why do you call yourself a furry? What purpose/meaning does it serve to you?
<otakon> Alister: enope, give me a tall girl that is curvy and nice.
<WindWhistler> I see...so that's how they'll use iPads in the future....
<Alister> otakon: :| ok , but if you change your mind
<RAWRity> Freud's logic was "I'll ask somebody a question, then talk about how they want to fuck everything."
<WindWhistler> hold them right in front of their eyes..
<Shizuka> 13so apparently, there's an easter egg here out of frame of a sprite of the original chaingun guy
<Shizuka> 13but i've never been able to find the cutscene room in th emap
<otakon> Shizuka: neat
<Petrified_Discord> OH NO MAGIC :O
<WindWhistler> I wonder if everyone in Doom 3 has glasses because of that.
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: All over the world, there are straight teens and young adults who are suddenly wanting to harmlessly break some gender barriers.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> enter the tentacle rapist zombies from hell
<sagas> Yay demonic possesion!
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: and psychological findings allow one to show that Freud was making shit up as he went along.
<otakon> Okay, who let him have the Necronomicon?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, we have Ask DRD and Ask Stripey Butts join us in call. ~yay~
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Stripey Butts?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Alister> oh my
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: I can see how you could see the show as culturally significant, IE bringing up the question of what really is "manly"
<killerpony7733> sagas the idea of anthromorphic animals the art the second identity alot of things
<Petrified_Discord> Sam Harding, no! :(
<otakon> dat flashlight
<SunderlandPony89> That guy sounds REALLY bored
<RAWRity> Freud is the Steve Jobs of psychology. He did very little to advance (and in some ways even hindered) the field, and then got famous for his image and talking himself up.
<Greth206> Look at that interactive environment!
<Rukario> don't do it
<Rukario> hi junh1024-XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OC goat SaxyPretender, but part of MLP.
<PinkiePie2Cupcake2> how do you make your text colors like that?
<WindWhistler> Really, why do they have to hold their computers up to their faces? I know it's supposed to be like some sort of menu, but that's kinda ridiculous.
<Petrified_Discord> "The accident should never have happened in the first place." NO, REALLY? :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Also, Freud smoked a LOT of opinum, iirc
<otakon> ah interesting RAWRity
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, I see, Nittany
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: It's certainly led a lot of guys into the pink toy aisle.
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: So did Nosta
<Petrified_Discord> You can see the sign Shizuka, put that gun away. :|
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: Nostradamus, and also Poe iirc
<SunderlandPony89> Irony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: TJ is drawing Roseluck right now.
<junh1024-XD> what
<Diglett> like half lie
<sagas> killerpony7733: Can being a brony mean something similar? The PMVs, the art, the music, and other products of the fandom?
<Spriggals> life*
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: I'd say. Turning quite a few heads as well :P
<Reikim> RAWRity: BUT he opened the field to a lot of people. He was an idiot, yes, but at least give him credit for publicizing the field.
<Petrified_Discord> Funfact: your partner is dead.
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: Seriously, prior to discovering this show, could you ever have imagined wanting My Little Pony toys?
<WindWhistler> So was that his friend who got turned into a monster?
<sagas> killerpony7733: the fan-fics, the conventions
<Om> I knew it!
<Diglett> yes spriggals half lie
<Diglett> life
<sagas> killerpony7733: the merchandise
<killerpony7733> sagas no cause in the end it all stems from MLP FIM on the other hand furries stems from a whole other idea
<Diglett> uckin f key
<killerpony7733> sagas not a show or anything but a idea
<RAWRity> Reikim: he publicized the field, and then set it back over 100 years by purporting his findings as facts despite having no actual scientific proof for what he suggested.
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: I dont think a single brony out there would of even considered touching anything related to MLP outside of extreme circumstances, and I'm no exception
<Spriggals> lol
<rocketbrony> hello peoples :D /) anyone?
<sagas> killerpony7733: dont furries all stem from anthropromorphic animals?
<Reikim> RAWRity: Okay, yes, I'll concede that. But hey, at least he gave us something to joke about.
<Iron_Edge> Was that a smoker? 0.0
<WindWhistler> rocketbrony: nope.avi
<Greth206> "I'm staying on the train!" "This train probably isn't safe."
<MahBoi777> rocketbrony: (\
<SunderlandPony89> rocketbrony: (\ Helll yeah!
<SunderlandPony89> OHai MahBoi777
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: And now, like me, you wonder why they can't make some good toys of the characters that you like.
<WindWhistler> Destroy ALL who oppose me!
<MahBoi777> heya SunderlandPony89!:)
<killerpony7733> sagas the idea of it yes bronies stems from MLP FIM the show thats different from the idea of anthromorphic animals
<Alister> Well , Finals begin tommorow. My body is ready
<Panda-> Damn this stress... making me fall asleep at the keyboard
<WindWhistler> DocSane: I wonder why they can't make Wind Whistler properly. Her mane isn't YELLOW.
<RAWRity> "People get angry because they secretly want to fuck their parents." "Interesting theory, what experiments let you to this conclusion?" "I figured that out from listening to a woman describe a dream she had about her father yelling at her." "That makes no sense." "SHUT UP I'M A MASTER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS"
<kirzstryfe> 8,6good evening everypony :)

<DocSane> They make a Wind Whistler toy? Isn't she G1?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: OMFG
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> hair kirzstryfe
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: I'm still wondering when Hasbro are gonna get their heads out their asses and make some MLP plushes. What I'd give fora RD plushie that isn't $100 on Ebay
<DashWithRainbows> Oh hey kirzstryfe.
<Iron_Edge> kirzstryfe: Sup bro /)
<rocketbrony> &
<rocketbrony> &4
<WindWhistler> CHAINSAW! :D
<Reikim> Evening kirzstryfe! I hope your day has gone as wonderful as ours.
<Shamroc> Shizuka: can i haz chainsaw...pwease
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Ahhhhh yeaaaaah!! CHAIN SAW! >:3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pfft, ONE chainsaw
<WindWhistler> Reikim: Wonderfully*
<Iron_Edge> My weapon of choice >:3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a real warrior uses a DOUBLE CHAINSAW
<Shamroc> also ello kirzstryfe
<Reikim> WindWhistler: Thank you.
<Om> Sooo, a chainsaw to the gut is NOT good for you?
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: No profit in good plushies for them.
<Petrified_Discord> SaxyPretender: We need chainsaw nunchucks :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like Jack from Madworld/Anarchy Reigns
<RAWRity> And then of course we hve "neo-freudians". And they just spout more bullshit. "I believe we are all connected by a collective uncociousness!" "What makes you say that?" "Because it sounds cool!"
<WindWhistler> We need chainsaw bazookas.
<Iron_Edge> SaxyPretender: /)
<Reikim> Speaking of CHAINSAWS, I'm debating whether or not to get Lollipop Chainsaw.
<WindWhistler> bazookas that shoot chainsaws. That would be awesome.
<cachi01> G2G Everypony BYE!!!
<killerpony7733> Om yeah gives bad tummy aches :S
<MahBoi777> bye cachi01!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(\ Iron_Edge
<Om> killerpony7733: Take a tums
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> cachi01: Dream of Ponies
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: Sigmund Freud had a couple good ideas.
<Alister> Concerning Freud
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Reikim, get it, I hear it's good
<Alister> http://memegenerator.net/instance/20389583?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: D'aww, that sucks. I gots no moneys for a fanmade plushie
<sagas> killerpony7733: I dont see how. I feel like the show itself stems from a group of ideals. Ideals that we happen to channel through the show
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: ideas that he never tested to see if they were true.
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: They're not that hard to make yourself.
<Reikim> Ha, I'd get Lollipop Chainsaw just to hear Twilight as a dumb blonde cheerleader who chops up zombies.
<Petrified_Discord> Chainsaw > All the powers of hell
<Wrek> 05is she in the garage rigth now?
<RAWRity> Let us not forget Freud gave us the wondeful idea of "Penis Envy"
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: But those ideas were still proven right by people.
<killerpony7733> sagas the idea came from the show itself and thats where all bronies see the reason of it
<DocSane> SunderlandPony99: A friend of mine took a class on plushie-making to cash in on the pony plushie gold mine.
<WindWhistler> BuckWheat: Probably because they believed it to be true.
<Wrek> 05hey Shizuka! post alpha or pre monorail?
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: I chose to hold of on getting Lollipop Chainsaw due to its length. Witcher 2 was to tempting for me considering its length and what I've heard of it. Will be picking it up sometime though
<Reikim> So apparently I accidentally threw us into a discussion about psychology.
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: but not by him. If I just shouted out every theory and idea I had about everything, I'd have to get one right eventually.
<WindWhistler> Wrek: She got off a train.
<Petrified_Discord> Psychology, fuck yeah! :D
<Wrek> 05during monorail then! yes!
<Wrek> 05im in time for my fav part
<Reikim> RAWRity: Silly foal, that's Politics, not Science.
<Alister> http://memegenerator.net/instance/14599087?urlName=freud&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
<RAWRity> My key point is: Freud came up with ideas that sounded like they MIGHT make sense. He then did nothing to verify them and instead just told people he was right.
<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: That's... not a bad idea actually. Only thing is, I have no idea where I could take a sowwing class. None in the town where I live unfortunately
<killerpony7733> Wrek what part? 6_9
<Shizuka> 13so much for staying on the train >>
<CECtheRonin> lol
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: Well I mean, he obviously had confidence in his ideas enough to publish them right?
<ponibas> throw momma from the train!
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> dat doom
<Wrek> 05cant WAIT until Shizuka meets sabaoth post delta
<Wrek> 05gona be awesome
<Reikim> BuckWheat: I present to you: TIME CUBE
<Petrified_Discord> It's okay guys, we can buff out those scratches :)
<CECtheRonin> When are you getting the BFG?
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: confidence doesn't make them true. And seeing as nearly every theory he had has been discredited by ACTUAL psychologists, I'd say confidence is most definitely NOT key in this situation.
<Alister> Wrek: you're an artist right ? do you take requests ?
<Wrek> 05CECtheRonin: if she knows the cote she can get one early delta IIRC
<Diglett> what does bfg stand for
<Randomnerd> Hold on... how does he climb using on ly his feet?
<Wrek> 05Alister: form time to time
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> big fucking gun
<SunderlandPony89> Diglett: Big Fucking Gun
<CECtheRonin> Wrek The cote?
<Randomnerd> I have never thought about that, before.
<Thedude946z[Eating]> brb gotta eat
<Spriggals> so who else is listening to the waltz of the flowers?
<Alister> Wrek: I'll take that as a not right now
<RAWRity> Because part of being a psychologist means trying your damndest to be objective and scientific about what you're doing.
<Reikim> ^
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Freud was the first in his field.
<Wrek> 05in other words RAWRity: appearing insane to the common man
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: a field of bullshit, yes.
<Randomnerd> He was wrong about a lot of things, but he was the first person to even ask the question.
<Alister> So you're saying Freud says everyone wanted to their mums because he wanted to bang his mum ?
<otakon> yes
<Petrified_Discord> Dat klaxon
<otakon> brb guys, restroom
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Let me guess. You read xkcd.
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: no, he was not.
<Om> Bloody Chainsaw!
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: no, I take psychology and do research.
<SunderlandPony89> Alister: That's one hell of a deep question :P
<CECtheRonin> Apparently, Freud was afraid of ferns. Weird bit of trivia.
<Reikim> So mfw I decide to watch Rah Xephon, and it turns out to be an Evangelion clone in reverse.
<sagas> killerpony7733: I feel that the desire to express the ideals of the show were always there, we just needed a way to channel them. We (or atleast I) wanted something and we happen to find that something in this show. I came to the show because I subconciously wanted an inoccent form of entertainment in an ever cynacle world. I wanted something good and wholesome that in a world that we feel is so violent and horrible. We wanted somethin
<killerpony7733> sagas got nothing to say back then?
<killerpony7733> woah
<RAWRity> Alister: I'm saying he THOUGHT everybody wanted to bang their mom, and never bothered to test it.
<Diglett> lol nope
<Wrek> 05what bothers me is that the arch viles arent in doom 3 as they were in the other ones
<RAWRity> Reikim: Meh, Rah Xephon's better than EVA in my opinion.
<Iron_Edge> Zombie: So I was telling fred about the game last night and----*small can lands on ground* what th---*explode*
<BuckWheat> RAWRity: You can be ambivalent on Freud all you want, but the truth is, some of his stuff has shaped the world of psychology and has had a profound impact. Even if a lot of his stuff was babble or even if he was throwing random stuff out there. He still had to think about the theory and tell it to the world.
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Cool then. Who would you say was the first "proper" pyschologist.
<Reikim> RAWRity: I said "in reverse" yes? Besides, I haven't finished..
<Randomnerd> I'm not challenging you, I'm actually curious.
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: fuck no.
*Alister gets crushed by the wall texts
<Alister> ugh
<sagas> killerpony7733: We all were drawn to this show for variouse reasons. All are ideals that symbolize what being a brony is all about
<sagas> Alister: Sorry, but I had a lot to say
<Alister> quit startin' sagas
<CECtheRonin> BuckWheat RAWRity Allow me to put this debate to bed: Most of Freud's theories have been disproven, but they did serve as a foundation for modern psychology and are still referenced.
<RAWRity> Psychology as a science easily predates Freud. The first psychologist, in terms of laboratories and it actually being science instead of Philosophy, would be Wundt
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Thank you.
<Shizuka> 13so this is ominous..
<sagas> killerpony7733: whether its something wanting to enjoy something feminin, innocent, or otherwise

<sagas> Petrified_Discord: Freud Pony. Nice
<BuckWheat> Alister: He had a good Dog.
<WindWhistler> Shamroc: I think Shizuka was wondering if you were still here.
<Wrek> 05i dare you to fist only the first hell knight you meet >:3
<Alister> BuckWheat: sure did
<nickstr> I never thought I would see Pikachu make several appearances on a music related Blog TV show
<nickstr> but I ddi
<Shamroc> WindWhistler: nah i was here then...
<nickstr> *did
<Reikim> One thing I have to say about Rah Xephon: the mech designs are damn cool.
<Shamroc> it was kirz
*SunderlandPony89 sits back and eats strawberries
<nickstr> well it was Pikachu in a way
<Spriggals> roger roger what you're victor victor
<RAWRity> Pavlov, that poor son of a bitch.
<sagas> Wrek: that came out sounding wrong
<BuckWheat> I think Schrodinger's cat could beat Pavlov's dog in a fight anyday haha.
<Alister> RAWRity: What do you mean ?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Wrek, you only do that on the 5th date
<kirzstryfe> 8,6BuckWheat: but how could you tell?
<SunderlandPony89> BuckWheat: Well that's a given since Cats > Dogs
<Petrified_Discord> Robert Price
<sagas> kirzstryfe: through observation
<RAWRity> He spends years as a psychologist, and all anybody remembers is his dog.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6but once you observe the cat, it's no longer Schrodinger's cat, it's just a cat
<RAWRity> BuckWheat: only if it's alive.
<RAWRity> so it could only win 50% of the time.
<RAWRity> Alister: what do I mean about what?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6or a dead cat, depending on the circumstances
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: Or a dead cat, depending.
<Alister> RAWRity: I remember him , I attribute how some people gain fetishes to his conditioning theory
<Alister> eww
<Alister> Alister you're gross
<Reikim> Thanks for that Alister.
<sagas> kirzstryfe: well then the poison would kill the dog too
<RAWRity> Alister: Ah, but he did more than just the classical conditioning stuff.
<Shizuka> 13i like how the emergency lights are designed
<Shizuka> 13very spooky level
<SunderlandPony89> Alister: Is it bad that I'm curious on this conditioning theory?
<Diglett> sagas: IT has to be a cat
<BuckWheat> kirzstryfe: The Bell is the dog's weakness.
<sagas> killerpony7733: I hope I didnt chase you away with my wall of text
<Diglett> cats ae more mathmaatic
<Greth206> Have sensitive information? Why not audio-log?
<WindWhistler> SunderlandPony89: Not really. We've all been conditioned one way or another.
<Shizuka> 13also yes i'm exaggerating reactions~
<CECtheRonin> sagas Can I get the cliff notes?
<Wrek> 05though my favorite areas are either the waste facilities in RoE or later delta
<Shizuka> 13i know where the jumps are
<Wrek> 05Shizuka :3
<RAWRity> granted, the Dog experiment was easilly his most infulential one, he did other stuff.
<Alister> SunderlandPony89: Conditioning someone to have a reaction to something will make him react the way wanted.
<killerpony7733> sagas as is aid i am very simple person when it comes to a why i don't go deeper then that but in the end i'm like one i just don't use the title it techinally makes me one so is there reason to call me one when i simply don't want the title but just want to be a part of it?
<killerpony7733> sagas said*
<Polydunami> ... Is this Doom 3?
<Diglett> no
<SaxyPretender> 0,14BronyState: Where we watch Doom 3 and discuss deep stuff
<RAWRity> It's like how "A-ha" are only remembered for Take On Me in teh states, but had huge success in europe.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<R-Dash5000> 11/10c/8p.
<sagas> killerpony7733: okay i can and will respect that
<WindWhistler> SaxyPretender: I lol'd.
<Spriggals> lol
<Alister> RAWRity: Why I'm interested in that , I think Sexual Deviancy or Fetishes are related to conditioning
<Thedude946z[Busy]> O-O
<Thedude946z[Busy]> O_o*
<Polydunami> RAWRity, what about The Living Daylights?
<sagas> R-Dash5000: why are you stating the time?
<Iron_Edge> Shizu! its witch! dont help her!
<WindWhistler> I wish I could say spontaneously funny stuff...
<Iron_Edge> -lol-
<WindWhistler> Give the witch ice cream!
<SunderlandPony89> Alister: Huh. I can... kinda see how that would work in some situations
<Spriggals> Its a dj
<Shizuka> 13the weighted companion datalinker will never threaten to sic hell on you
<Diglett> Shizuka nothing can make diglett flinch
<R-Dash5000> BECAUSE I AM THE R-DASH 5000. CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. SWAG.
<Thedude946z[Busy]> Lol
<Thedude946z[Busy]> Magic.mov
<Polydunami> Hot damn
<Alister> SunderlandPony89: I know it did for me. I don't expect you to want an explanation ?
<BuckWheat> But I'd say that Schrodinger's cat is the Smells Like teen Spirit of the Science world.
<Panda-> Well everypony, I'll be on later :)
<sagas> R-Dash5000: and a handy clock
<Alister> bye Panda-
<Polydunami> Bye Panda- :3
<CECtheRonin> Alister I respectfully disagree. I've experienced some things starting very early on before there was a chance for any conditioning to take place.
<otakon> guys, I think I'm gonna get out of here for the night
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Panda-
<otakon> night Panda-
<SunderlandPony89> Alister: Is this related to the fetish thing you brought up earlier? Either way, I dont mind
<Wrek> 05btw shizu remember how trippy the later hell/delta merges are? x3
<Polydunami> PandaDash?
*sagas hugs Panda- goodbye
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: In the words of shizu :isnt that just like a friend, once your dead takes your stereo"
<otakon> Shizuka: thanks for the stream dear
<R-Dash5000> Yeah, because you might be too hooked to the stream to notice.
<SunderlandPony89> See ya Panda-
<Panda-> otakon: i said later silly :D
<WindWhistler> Uh oh. Trippy stuff is coming up?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> otakon: Dream of Ponies
<otakon> Panda-: oh
*Panda- hugs everypony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ask Palette Swap mod is now in call on stream. ~yay~
<killerpony7733> sagas i by all standards am a brony but again i don't use the title so why argue with that? as long as i interact with the community its as if i am one
<otakon> Panda-: well I'M going to bed myself actually
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: ncie
<WindWhistler> otakon: What's with the "dear"? It makes you sound kinda creepy. :o
<Polydunami> C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
<Diglett> otakon and metal gear
<otakon> Night all take care
<Reikim2> Night otakon
<Polydunami> Goodnight otakon :)
<otakon> WindWhistler: I call girls dear, bad habit I know.
<SunderlandPony89> See ya otakon
<WindWhistler> good day otakon
<CECtheRonin> Night, otakon :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later otakon
<MahBoi777> gnight otakon
*WindWhistler just wants to say the opposite of everyone else
<Alister> CECtheRonin: That isn't the point. Conditioning is when you used something to trigger a reaction combined with something that doesn't trigger. Result : the subject has been conditioned to react to the other ''trigger''
<otakon> night guys, take care(again) and SOMEONE wish me some luck getting a job.
<Wrek> 05video linkup requested Shizuka.
<killerpony7733> sagas long discussion was long :O
<Reikim2> otakon: Don't singe the bed. Actually, you should look into putting out that fire...
<kenne> bye otakon :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good luck, otakon
<MahBoi777> good luck otakon
<otakon> take it easy kenne
<kenne> otakon: i will try :3
<Shamroc> Shizuka: your not save there.......but then again your not safe anywhere
<Alister> Reikim2: why the 2 ?
<WindWhistler> Hey, you can't just ask people to wish you luck. I ask people to listen to me when I'm talking, and how often does that happen?
<Shizuka> 13the light flicker works really really well with the HDR effects
*sagas is very confused right now in his life
<Reikim2> Alister: When I DC the system doesn't properly register it.
<Alister> ok
<killerpony7733> sagas whys that? 6_9
<Polydunami> ... How did I get on the Pinkie Pie server? I'm in Vancouver for heavens sake xD
<sagas> killerpony7733: Im having confusing emotions right now
<Polydunami> *heaven's
<MahBoi777> lol
<Alister> But I have to say this theory is based on personal experience only
<WindWhistler> See? It happened again!
<killerpony7733> sagas ah ok any reason.....for it?
<CECtheRonin> Hey, if we were to ever stream Sherlock on here, would anyone object?
<Reikim> sagas: Redundant adjective is redundant.
*WindWhistler complains
<Polydunami> Wait, I know what the problem is: my client is based in Germany.
<R-Dash5000> Do you like The Aquabats super show?
<sagas> Reikim: :D
<CECtheRonin> Alister Fair point, but I don't quite get how that ties into fetish development.
<Spriggals> I want to eat an orange now...
<CECtheRonin> R-Dash5000 Never saw the appeal, personally.
<Alister> CECtheRonin: Unless you want me to explain my story , I'll have to leave it at that
<Wrek> 05i like oranges, thye are tasty, henceforth i ahs fetish and wants to sex the orange.
<sagas> killerpony7733: Im feeling the desire to be intimate with men, but I feel heterosexual
<Polydunami> Oh my
<sagas> i know
<Alister> Wrek: That's not my point
<R-Dash5000> Did you watch the AO TV show last monday?
<sagas> R-Dash5000: no
<CECtheRonin> Alister I don't mind personally, but I'm not so sure about everyone else.
<Alister> pirvate chat ?
<killerpony7733> sagas well i'm pansexual though maybe a bit Bi in that too but i more or less choose a person for personality
<Orange> Wrek: :(
<Wrek> 05just messing with you Alister
<CECtheRonin> Alister Sure.
<CECtheRonin> Alister No idea how.
<Reikim> Oh Wrek...
<Wrek> 05i wanted orange. it gave me lemon lime
<Shamroc> Wrek: whoa man...thats...a little creepy..even for jokeing

<Reikim> Dat shotgun
<Wrek> 05I am certain!
<killerpony7733> Wrek was it the maintenance guy?
<ponibas> sorry shizu, a shotgun blast to the head should be instadeath (except boss mobs) =p
<Wrek> 05your fingerm ight have slipped
<DashWithRainbows> all I can think of is Shizuka's character saying the same things as Heavy when he has his fists out.
<Wrek> 05it was the mantinence guy, he knows i liek orange
<WindWhistler> Wrek why are you talking to yourself?
<Wrek> 05so you think the staff has somekind of plot?
<Diglett> !
<sagas> killerpony7733: The thing is I feel the need to be intimate with men, but no desire for sex. I feel the desire for sex with women, but no desire for intimacy with them
<SaxyPretender> 0,14those guys are trying to get aHEAD in life
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Shizu and her shotgun
<Reikim> Shizuka is just too good at this. I'm starting to become afraid of her.
<killerpony7733> Wrek Forgive my interruption my vision is augmented

<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest eeyup

<Om> Saxy and they are bloody unlucky after life.

<WindWhistler> I'm so boooooored
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: too bad they tried to merge the pain elemental and cacodeamon from start and jsut dissed the pain elemental in the end
*WindWhistler scoots around the room with her legs.
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: now if only she had aa katana
<sagas> killerpony7733: I feel I wont be fully satisfied with either and I fucking hate it
<RAWRity> I didn't know they were making an Ender's Game film.
<Spriggals> MLG
<Shizuka> 13:3
<killerpony7733> sagas hmmm...
<Polydunami> I'm a cat! >:3

<Wrek> 05Shizuka: saftey procedure orange includes beign annoying
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> and laughing creepyly
*Polydunami purrs :3
<SunderlandPony89> Safety prodecure Grape is better than Safety prodecure Orange
<Reikim> RAWRity: Woah woah woah. I'm sensing you're referring to some kind of adaptation here. Details?
<sagas> Whats Ender's Game?
*killerpony7733 strokes Polydunami?
<RAWRity> Reikim: they're making an Ender's Game movie
<killerpony7733> does that make you purr more?
<killerpony7733> :D
<WindWhistler> I prefer safety procedure lemon
*Polydunami hisses >:<
<RainbowJack> Shizuka do you have the BFG?
<RAWRity> And I'm wondering how they'll handle the ending.
<killerpony7733> Polydunami :O....easy
<Reikim> RAWRity: Hm, my interest is piqued...also /) because that book is one of my all-time favourites.
<WindWhistler> RainbowJack: If she did, I think she'd be using it.
<Spriggals> wtf is that
<Polydunami> Wait, I thought you were someone else. Sorry :3
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: or when you get to read about the monsters origins in the dissection area
<Shizuka> 13not til next level, or the one after
<Wrek> 05:D
<killerpony7733> Polydunami ah :D
<Shizuka> 13forget if it's before teleport
<Reikim> Shizuka, I think that JUST MAYBE you have too many weapons.
<RAWRity> I wonder if like, instead of the actual ending, they instead have Ender crash his spaceship into the queen's ship, saving the world, while shouting "USA! USA!"
<DeadpoolDash> monsters
*sagas hugs Polydunami
*Polydunami is hugged :3
<Spriggals> lol
<killerpony7733> lol dat jump
<Reikim> RAWRity: I'd kill the producers myself, but it's a possibility.

<WindWhistler> inb4 the ending is like ME3
<Shizuka> 13punch dat plot~
<Om> Jumpin zombies!
<Reikim> Why.
<MahBoi777> EGAD
<SunderlandPony89> Poor zombie
<SunderlandPony89> Woah
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: I think that was janitor joe :< he was retiring today....
<Wrek> 05you could say Shizuka... (glasses) packs alot of punch
<RAWRity> WindWhistler: actually, there are some striking simularities to the ME3 ending and Ender's Game
<WindWhistler> so...punching a zombie somehow makes all its skin melt off?
*Reikim aneurysms from the bad pun
<SaxyPretender> 0,14YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Greth206> I'm pretty much only listening to this game at this point, and that has got to be one of the cheapest punching sfx I've heard in a while...
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: booooo :D
<SunderlandPony89> Didn't know it was possible to punch the flesh and organs off a zombie
<TheRareP0N3> RISE AND SHINE MR FREEMAN.
<TheRareP0N3> hello
<Diglett> dun dun dun
<Polydunami> Are you saving lost souls, Shizuka? :3
<RAWRity> Most notable: both end with an enormous massacre of an entire planet.
<DeadpoolDash> damn you CSI: Miami
<Reikim> RAWRity: So do the Metroid games, but we're not bringing those into this.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14those guys are losing their heads over Shizuka
<SunderlandPony89> inb4 Other M rage
<Diglett> hey what does the +tn mean
<Polydunami> I liek Doom >:3
<WindWhistler> I think it'd be more similar if the character you're playing as isn't even alive
<Reikim> SunderlandPony89: Nah, we avoided that.
