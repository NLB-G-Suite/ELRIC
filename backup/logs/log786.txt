<Shizuka> 13i do have to question how a terrorist would get on air force one in the first place
<Stallion_of_War> 1. Terrorists and 2. Air Force One

<pony_4908> It said that they killed a group of Russian reporters, and forged their identifications.
<PresidentGanjalf> Shizuka: The answer is "Use gun". And if that won
*GilDash also pokes LoGaN back.
<PresidentGanjalf> -won't work, "Use more gun/"

A small squad of developers had been working on various multiplayer prototypes for the post-apocalyptic shooter, but the group was folded back into the studio's single-player team after E3 to focus on the story side of the Metro 2033 sequel.
<Shizuka> 13is this the famous line?
<AdamTheDuck> :/ Sorry for the wall
<Sundaysmile> yes it is
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Well, I hope you get some good ones.

<QBAlchemist> wasnt bad, but the effects were apparent and the physics were low ... so 5/10
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: why
<Buytoast> Ah yes.
<Sundaysmile> * _ *
<Buytoast> The song of my people.
<Iwa> Shizuka: The guy that wasn't allowed on his plane? :(

<Iwa> Alchemist: So you don't like Braveheart? Gna gna :P
<QBAlchemist> oh god, what have i done >_<
<Sundaysmile> Independance Day
<pony_4908> Alchemist: I wouldn't say this was especially patriotic. His being the President was just a major plot device to give the whole story tension and motive.
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: well besides that it wasnt so bad, although somewhat boring at times
<QBAlchemist> BRAVEHEART!
<Med> Independence Day1
<burninghoove> space balls!!

<Alchemist> Iwa: its just my opinion, I know most people like Braveheart.

<Brother_Aura> Wrek.
<Socks> As soon as I saw this scene Fluttershy was my favourite pony.
<Yahooz> Brother_Aura: that explains itseld

<Sundaysmile> awkward silence time
<BaconMane> 0,5O BBY
<Brother_Aura> Is he a moderator in jiggly's funhouse?
<alexxm|foal> rainbow dash was my favorite pony since i started watching
<twilight_sprinkle> i dislike fluttershy even more after today
<RawketLawnchair> OH hello Worst pony.
<Brother_Aura> CRAP
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity is clearly the superior and best all-around pony
<Michael> have you noticed how fluttershy was the only one twilight took an interest in off the back
<Cypresswolf> NO! I'm allergic to adorableness....awww that squee *dies*
<Socks> She just reminds me of me :)
<Yahooz> Wrek yields no mercy for the weak
<Brother_Aura> made the joke anyway ._.
<Babsy> Fluttershy has and always had been my favorite
<BlankFlank> CrystalPhoenix: indeed.
<Kotano> RawketLawnchair: There is now worst pony
<CountDoofus> CrystalPhoenix: same here. She was my number 1 ever since this scene.
<Kotano> *no
<Socks> Not sure if that's good or not...

<Fl00t4sh41> CrystalPhoenix: I started hating Rarity for being so annoyingly girly girly. But she grows on you and now she's my favourite of the mane 6
<Socks> D'awwww she's so cute ^_^
<CrystalPhoenix> Fl00t4sh41, pretty much
<FlutterMEDIC> to be quite frank, this whole best pony business is silly
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity is complex
<YokusaHHart> FlutterMEDIC: Ikr

<Brother_Aura> SWEEPY....
<twilight_sprinkle> i love that scene
<QBAlchemist> CrystalPhoenix: that should be a movie; The RARTIY COMPLEX
<Fl00t4sh41> The change started around the time she bucked the charging manticore
<Socks> Fl00t4sh41: I've heard that story a lot. Rarity probably has the most character of the 6.
<FlutterMEDIC> inb4 Derpy

<cachi01> yep lol
<Shizuka> 13OF ALL THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN
<PresidentGanjalf> cachi01: We should stream that propaganda vid once
<Fl00t4sh41> How does he keep his hair so perfectly when its always wet?
<BladedWings> thelonecubone: hmmmm...*stares at the comment*
<thelonecubone> oh wow, i'm so behind :D
<Shizuka> 13now... really.. why would nightmare moon think this would impede our heroines
<PresidentGanjalf> thelonecubone: nope, it's actualy real one
<PresidentGanjalf> Ded
<YokusaHHart> ...Why do I suddenly feel like marshmallows?
<Dashie_Dashie> Shizuka: Appearently she doesn't know about metrosexuality.
<twilight_sprinkle> and there was so much blood, we just slid down the mountain!
<Shizuka> 13now it doesn't match
<alexxm|foal> Shizuka perhaps she throat she they woukd drown in the lake?
<Michael> lol
<PresidentGanjalf> MAH MOOSTACH!
<Michael> tis what I thought
<Fl00t4sh41> Shizuka: Maybe she thought he'd be enraged rather than saddedend
<twilight_sprinkle> SMASHING http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5dmirpMzT1r8nk72.gif
<cachi01> i thought she killed steven so they could cross the river using his corpse
<BlankFlank> must smell great
<wipergone2> dafuck

<Dashie_Dashie> She's got a babs tail.

<Shizuka> 13see and now there's a perfect bridge
<BladedWings> thelonecubone: *says like twilight* i dont get it...she treats me well if thats what you me...and visa versa
<Shizuka> 13nightmare moon is almost a worse villain than sombra
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Shizuka: lol maybe he'll get some purple streaks through the other onee to match :D
<Fl00t4sh41> And enraged river serpent would have been a heck of an obstacle
<Sundaysmile> nopony is worst villain than sombra
<Fl00t4sh41> Sundaysmile: Truth
<cachi01> yeah nightmare moon........ you could just simply use your magic.....and you know........kill them or something
<CountDoofus> Discord was a foal cmpared to Sombra >_>
<PresidentGanjalf> Come with us Raaaainbooow...
<Michael> like our voices don't scare you
<Michael> or anything
<Fl00t4sh41> CountDoofus: Obvious Troll is obvious
<Shizuka> 13oo look he's evading klines
<CountDoofus> You don't say :D
<pony_4908> Is that Tabitha St. Germain?
<pony_4908> Sounds like her.
<Michael> so are the shadow bolts real or just ficticious
<YokusaHHart> pony_4908: yep
<pony_4908> Michael: They're illusions created by Nightmare Moon.
<cachi01> or you know.......use your magic to fix the bridge...
<Michael> no I mean
<thelonepony> BladedWings: did you get it?
<Michael> like does luna have her own team
<Fl00t4sh41> Why doesn't NMM just magically weaken the ropes so they'll fall when they try to cross?
<cachi01> Michael: they are luna's OC
<Michael> xD
<pony_4908> Michael: Nope. The actual Wonderbolts serve royal duties in times of emergency. They're like, the go-to RAF of Equestria.
<Michael> because that would be over pg
<Fl00t4sh41> Michael: Maybe she used to have her own team?
<Shizuka> 13it means wait for the plot to develop
<Dashie_Dashie> The elements of marmalade
<BladedWings> thelonepony: umm i think...but i think it should be talked about in private :D
<thelonepony> BladedWings: naw dont,

<Shizuka> 13or your son?
<RawketLawnchair> I like Nightmare Moon more than I do Luna.
<Shizuka> 13I'VE ABANDONED MY BOY! I'VE ABANDONED MY CHILD!
<Fl00t4sh41> Ooops. The elements just kind of broke, didn't they
<Fl00t4sh41> What crappy construction
<BlankFlank> why does NMM get so small when she turns into luna?
<Shizuka> 13>reassured
<Shizuka> 13>honesty
<Shizuka> 13wut
<twilight_sprinkle> shes the element of [honesty]!
<Fl00t4sh41> BlankFlank: She gets depowered
<cachi01> Shizuka: logic
<Dashie_Dashie> A DINGO ATE MAH BABY.
<Michael> I used to think nightmare moon had bat wings
<BlankFlank> So.. Celestia could turn into a 'small version' aswell?
<cachi01> spirit of happiness would've been better :I
<pony_4908> "LOYALTY"
<Fl00t4sh41> Shizuka: AJ was never very good at honesty, was she?
<twilight_sprinkle> they all arent perfect at their elements
<Iwa> pony_4908: Well, someone in the army who acts like a dick, is still loyal to his country :P
<Shizuka> 13that uh
<Michael> dun dun dun
<Shizuka> 13twilight's making this up as she goes
<Fl00t4sh41> I've read a theory that the elements they embody is more a matter of what they try to be, than what they naturally are
<Michael> xD
<Shizuka> 13TASTE THE RAINBOW
<Fl00t4sh41> AJ want's to be honest and dependable
<Michael> you said it to early
<sub06905> ded

<GilDash> That's a bright suit...

<J_E_Smith71> aniderp: Yep
<LadyCanary> Shizuka: She does! Tiana.
<Reikim> Nobody is friends in here, anyway.
<Babsy> So beautiful
<Fl00t4sh41> Deadlypon3: Because thats what teh old disney cartoon had
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka she looks exactly like the Disney Classic Fox and the hound

<Reikim> We kind of just collectively mock each other in a vaguely friendly fashion.
<DashWithRainbows> Yush
<Shizuka> 13i get the feeling they based the design on her
<Buytoast> Tiana Shizuka?
<LadyCanary> Why does it matter Deadlypon3.

<Jageman> Blaze666: That only kinda makes sense. But i guess magic does not need to make sense.
<Iwa> Shizuka: Or it's disney being disney and trying to be politically correct in the most radical ways...*shrug*
<QBAlchemist> like a stuck record
<LadyCanary> In NY, Cinderella is gonna come back on Broadway >w<

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, AdamTheDuck. :D
<BladedWings> Ok, back from my shower...how much did i miss? XD
<Cypresswolf> Deadlypon3: Yes, its possible to make them, but not practical to wear
<Fl00t4sh41> So if Cinderella is walking around on glass shoes, how do they not shatter under her weight when she walks?
<DashWithRainbows> Also, you've never seen me, poniesarecoolyay, only Scoot-Scootaloo has.
<Babsy> LadyCanary: I would see it

<kirzstryfe> the only catch there is that the person trolling you has probably used a virtual host before for their regular login
<FableCharm> lol, Deadlpon3
<FlutterMEDIC1> Fl00t4sh41: hah, your Carrot Top cannot top a Derpy riding a velociraptor with a RPG while a nuke is going off in the background!

<Cypresswolf> the ladies look a bit dizzy from all that spinning
<QBAlchemist> FASTER!
<FlutterMEDIC1> Fl00t4sh41: yes, but is Carrot Top wielding a ridculous weapon while a nuke is going off in the background? i though not
<Yahooz> well his Realname is ...

<QBAlchemist> i wonder if they ever ran out of breath in this movie
<Deadlypon3> Man, hope the prince got a prick of her blood at the ball so they can identify her
<Reikim> What?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, J_E_Smith71. :)
<cachi01> when
<Deadlypon3> Instead of a shoe that could fit anyone her foot size
*thelonepony gives cachi01 a prize ?
<Deadlypon3> ...well yes
<QBAlchemist> BladedWings: its a lvl 1 rattata that kills ANYTHING ... but only works on one pokemon
<Deadlypon3> Cause you made me like that
<Deadlypon3> I actually did
<thelonepony> Hi Dark92Enigma- :)
<Deadlypon3> I wouldn't have gotten to the ball
<Reikim> Shaddup and end the confusion already.
<BladedWings> QBAlchemist: wow...how does that even work?
<cachi01> wut
<Shizuka> 13yeah that's not a glass slipper
<QBAlchemist> BladedWings: it abuses the pokemon moves and egg stuff
<cachi01> BRB
<Ceko> Search it on google.
<Shizuka> 13plexiglass at best
<BladedWings> QBAlchemist: ah
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka Best Plastic Slipper :p
<Deadlypon3> She's from the dump :p
<Shizuka> 13to the dump to the dump to the dump dump dump
<Dark92Enigma-> hi thelonepony!
<Shizuka> 13guinan get out of this movie
<GilDash> How can they make that argument when the whole idea was to pick a girl in one night?
<Shizuka> 13guard in the background is like "are they done singing yet"
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka: 1.000.000 years DUNGEON for him/her
<BladedWings> dat Whoopie singing....wow
<Shizuka> 13OOO
<Shizuka> 13HE WAS IN TITANIC
<Shizuka> 13just noticed
<Shizuka> 13i knew he looked familiar
<aniderp> which guy?
<Dark92Enigma-> So the song had no purpose?
<Shizuka> 13well i'm muted so.. was that his father?
<Shizuka> 13next to whoopi?
<Dark92Enigma-> Billy Zane?
<Shizuka> 13no not zane
<Shizuka> 13purple guy
<Eli> wow this will be one nasty slipper
<Shizuka> 13he was mr andrews in titanic
<Deadlypon3> Yeah, Shizuka :p
<Eli> all the girls in the kingdom will have worn it...
<aniderp> red tie guy?
<Tovler> Isn't Rango too recent to be eligible?
<Shizuka> 13nice socks
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Do you like Sound of Music and King and I? These songs were written by the same guys
<Deadlypon3> It's too establish that the dude wants to find that girl...
<Deadlypon3> ...Yep...
<Shizuka> 13J_E_Smith71: haven't seen either
<poniesarecoolyay> i like prizes
<QBAlchemist> couldnt he just look at thier faces?
<QBAlchemist> he got a pretty close look at the ball ...
<Shizuka> 13really seems like a glass slipper would be a pain to wear
<Nittany_Discord> Sure that's not a plastic slipper?
<Shizuka> 13can't flex at all
<Cypresswolf> 1000 women in the kingdom - and this slipper will fit only one, surely
<Iwa> Shows how rotten girls are in the fairy tale universe...they damn well KNOW they weren't the girl, but still will test their "luck" to practically screw over the prince...*golfclap* :P
<Dashie_Dashie> lolnope
<Shizuka> 13BAH GAWD THE SLEEPER HOLD
<Deadlypon3> ITS QUITe...Impossible
<BladedWings> oh she had it for a second lol
<Deadlypon3> And the slipper breaks
<Dashie_Dashie> Oh jeez.
<Fl00t4sh41> you'd think there'd be more than one person in the kingdom with that shoe size
<QBAlchemist> whu doors?
<cachi01> too bad you aint getting any
<Ryunosuke> that hobble
<Cypresswolf> Conspicuous >_>
<poniesarecoolyay> :(
<BladedWings> eeyup, nothin behind this door <_<
<Reikim> Posting a retort three minutes late doesn't really work.
<Ryunosuke> a door that goes... nowhere?
<Cypresswolf> The law said Every <Maiden

<FlutterMEDIC> Ryunosuke: reminds me of Tom & Jerry

<Dashie_Dashie> Shizuka, are you taking requests after the EMN?
<cachi01> deprderdpepdpeu0ud
<FlutterMEDIC> chat derp?
<FlutterMEDIC> nope
<FlutterMEDIC> just slow
<Shizuka> 13no
<J_E_Smith71> You know this is one of the flaws of a multiracial Cinderella story...Cinderella was the one thin black woman. You have an easier time picking her out instead of checking every single women in the kingdom
<Shizuka> 13wrek will be drawing wub
<Saturn> 08,01so i just watched today's episode
<QBAlchemist> drawing wub?

<QBAlchemist> NOOOOO!

<BladedWings> Noooooooo!
<LadyCanary|away> HAHA!

<Nittany_Discord> A lot of fanservice this episode.

<Deadlypon3> ...No they don't, nobody lovies me
<Babsy> Songg~ :)
<Trollestia> Deadlypon3: Don't even question it... It's cillerenda
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: don't spoil it for me, i have to watch it now because of my parents
<LadyCanary|away> What I dont understand is why the prince had to have all the girls in the kingdom try on the slipper.
<Fl00t4sh41> Did the godmother change dress in the middle of a song?
<Dark92Enigma-> QBAlchemist: oh i will
<Wrek> 05and that comment J_E_Smith71 would earn you a ban
<Wrek> 05but i wont
<QBAlchemist> Dark92Enigma-: i might be overbuilding your enthusiasm XD
<BladedWings> LadyCanary|away: yea, how did someone not have the same size slipper XD
<Dark92Enigma-> Fl00t4sh41: establishing shots. what's that?

<Cypresswolf> And they lived happily ever after! - And what of the Evil Step Mother & Wicked Step Sisters? They starved to death because they had no idea how to do anything on their own, after forcing Cinderella to do all the work for so many years - The End!
<Deadlypon3> Trollestia that's how you say it in the play :P
<LadyCanary|away> BladedWings: Well...Because she's black. So that would automatically knock out some of the girls.
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka: It's the circle of.......Liiiiiiiife
<Deadlypon3> 5/10 it isn't aweful it's just forgetable
<Fl00t4sh41> I thought it was awful
<Cypresswolf> There was a serious lack of singing mice/10 >_>

<Jageman> I have seen so many worse movies than this.
<QBAlchemist> BladedWings: bab ?!? XZD
<BladedWings> damn it XD
<BladedWings> *bad
<Dark92Enigma-> The ENIGMA'S review of Cinderella (1997): Surprinsingly enough, this movie was better than i thought. The costumes and sets were great--firmly placing this in the vaguely "old world" romantic place that fairy tales live--the pop stylings and characters of the actors instantly make this a period piece of the late 20th century--but that's just fine. Cinderella will be reborn many times in the coming generations. So sweet and va
<QBAlchemist> BladedWings: there there
<Shizuka> 13so that happened
<QBAlchemist> Dark92Enigma-: ... damn
<J_E_Smith71> Now for a better wedding story

<Cypresswolf> Oh Spike, this is why Twilight wants you to read those books she gives you
<QBAlchemist> i wonder if we will ever see a filly from Amour and Cadence
<Jageman> BladedWings: the songs get stuck in my head and dont go away. I like them, but they get annoying after a while

<Worgeral> i just realized when the we shared our hopes we shared our dreams part came up there were 3 alicorns as the guards
<cachi01> look at mah art http://oi45.tinypic.com/1hv9t.jpg
*thelonepony huggles AdamTheDuck :3
<Iwa> Shizuka: The force field holds out any creature not intended to pass it, so when they get repelled out, the guards can seize them immidiately...that's my headcanon, anyway
<twilight_sprinkle> a thread has been amde against canterlot??
<Worgeral> BOOM
<Shizuka> 13but

<Shizuka> 13SHE WOULD BE THE MARE OF HONOR
<Iwa> Shizuka: Clean up the organ and other remains with their practical pointy garbage picking pins :)

<gamax92> yes it is.
<Shizuka> 13cadence, if you're going to be evil, at least try to kill twilight
<cachi01> no
<alexxm|foal> Shizuka to be fair she had no proof and she had been acting overprotective since they heard about the wedding
<poniesarecoolyay> i made nice friends like scootachicken and reikim

<JamesClydesdale> xD Shizuka xD
<twilight_sprinkle> that turn was kinda weird
<PresidentGanjalf> That Spy is not a Spy!
<Iwa> Shizuka: And that's why Sombra is actually the only villain who is actively trying to make a difference instead of taunting...even though he is terrible at it
<Cypresswolf> Checks out >_>
<poniesarecoolyay> maybe he wont want to be my friend anymore :(

<cachi01> gamax92: that would be easy
<aniderp> soooooon
<gamax92> Dashie_Dashie: its too bright for creepers.
<cachi01> gamax92: just change the slenderman model for a slendemane model
<Dark92Enigma-> MINE......ALL MINE
<cachi01> and there you go
<Shizuka> 13it's well composed but the only reason this won best pony song was because it had aired the week before voting

<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: those questions are pretty bad, since she didnt necessarily wait
<aniderp> finally the moment has arrived

<GilDash> I still think it's best pony song, but I always like the villain songs.
<QBAlchemist> tron sound effect

<DinkyDoo> Speed: 15.
<Dark92Enigma^> BladedWings: basically, trolling

<Trollestia> LUNA
<gamax92> Shizuka: lol
<AttackWithHugs> Oh god, please don't say Dagobah System
<sub06905> cause luna is useless
<Tovler> If she'd use dark magic, aging would be a snap
<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: BECAUSE she's on the moon occassionally
<boodfire> maybe magic mail doesn't go through magic dom?
<Shizuka> 13that way celestia shows up going "did i miss anything"
<Trollestia> Orr... Zecora.
<DinkyDoo> Take her on MOUTH to MOUTH.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: hard to believe that the ending makes up for all of this
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: Dagobah System :)
<thelonepony> Saberavia
<GilDash> I love Zecora in the episode.
<QBAlchemist> so zebras are naturaly magical?
<Trollestia> DinkyDoo: ;)
<AlienWarhead> Shizuka: Can Spike send to other ponies?
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, GilDash.
<DinkyDoo> Its like an Earth pony using magic.

<XylemTube> THIS IS WHINING
<DinkyDoo> Why no gore?
<GilDash> I still want to see more griffons...

<QBAlchemist> empty your mind ...
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh hey star wars
<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: things have changed since Twilight Sparkle left Ponyville.......or should i say. TRIXIEPOLIS
<Azuredragon> Twilight is Jesus
*Trollestia is actually Blaze666 so Blaze666 is sent to the sun and Trollestia is left in Equestria to rule the world
<AlienWarhead> Twilight is best water bender
<QBAlchemist> "no one makes it on the first try"
<Dashie_Dashie> WATER BENDING
<Shizuka> 13twilight, jesus you aren't
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: but making her apologetic without destroying her character... it works! :O
<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: the last of their kind?
<PresidentGanjalf> "Do or do not! There is no try."
<Trollestia> UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED YODA REFERENCE

<Dark92Enigma^> WHY IS IT SO MEAN<1?
<Shizuka> 13well fraud is higher on the scale of good than evil
<Starlight_Phoenix> why not just dig underground?
<AlienWarhead> Sheds are more trustworthy
<Cypresswolf> :D I love Snail's line
<Trollestia> ^^^ Guy above me is totally right. Completely right. Definitely and absolutely right.
<Babsy> She was tree
<DocSane> Those are a couple of REALLY strong 8 year olds.
<Azuredragon> Splintershy
<Mozdoc> Was there something from the first Trixie episode about here not trusting wheels?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: that makes sense
<J_E_Smith71> Now we instead of Fluttertree we have Flutterlog
<CrystalPhoenix> Dark92Enigma^, those two references
<PresidentGanjalf> Wait, wasn't she wandering with a cravan before. You know, a caravan with WHEELS?
<Jageman> Trollestia: pinkie pie reaches behild the invisible curtain and gets stuff.
<MadSurge> Also Fluttershy is a tree again
<Shizuka> 13why not just get the birds to do it
<Trollestia> Jageman: BALL EMERGENCY
<Dark92Enigma^> Is Fluttershy wearing socks?
<DinkyDoo> Everfree forest = BLANKED APPLEBLOOM
<AJIsAwesome> SKy Running is best running
<Azuredragon> Teddy bear
<Cypresswolf> Yes

<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: you forgot fire, water, air, earth, and heart
<Starlight_Phoenix> this needs to be a yugioh card battle
<AttackWithHugs> Shizuka, I wouldn't put jealousy in there. The elements seem to be some kind of purity
<LadyCanary> THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING! Rebel 2! Action!
<DinkyDoo> OMG

<Trollestia> HEY WHAT THE FUCK TRIXIE
<Eli> MakerDusk: and there are soo little fucks to give from me
<Tovler> I don't understand, how can this be? Open your eyes, maybe you'll see.
<Mozdoc> There's going to be a lot of stallion arts of the main six now...
<AJIsAwesome> What are you talking about, MakerDusk?
<Eddmario> Eyup, in Equestria sex changes are done with magic instead of surgery.
<RawketLawnchair> Mozdoc: Slooooooooow poke.
<XylemTube> Trixie is dumb, stupid dumb.
<Nyst> Trixie should just have worn both.
<Azuredragon> Powerfiler
<Ponies47> Dat evil laugh
<Eli> MakerDusk: if it makes you happy, go on. troll.
<MadSurge> Dat stallion AJ :D
<gamax92> Tovler: no rhyming
<Tovler> NOW I'LL WEAR BOTH AMULETS!!
<sub06905> why not have both on?
<RDash5000> Mozdoc: there already is
<MakerDusk> I don't even know, AJIsAwesome
<Trollestia> Eddmario: What did you expect?
<AJIsAwesome> MakerDusk: ???
<Dark92Enigma^> she has both TRIFORCES
<MakerDusk> I'm busy trolling the gnaa
<Blaze666> *cough* more powerful
<Trollestia> sub06905: BECAUSE TRIXIE THAT'S WHY
<[]DeadpoolDash> well PS2 just got all done downloading
<sub06905> lol
<MakerDusk> so I'm a tad on overdrive right now XD
<LadyCanary> Aw.
<Shizuka> 13and now it's crumbs
<PresidentGanjalf> Agony? Jesus, Trixie...
<twilight_sprinkle> agony
<QBAlchemist> >_>
<Eli> MakerDusk: ah that's probably even honorable
<Buytoast> you owe the zebra a new trinket
*LadyCanary pecks at the crumbs.
<anton> lol
<Trollestia> WHAAAAAAAAT
<Trollestia> DOORSTOP??
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity Belle is best pony
<thelonepony> may the Trolling be with you, always
<RawketLawnchair> A little bit of cleverness.
<Blaze666> []DeadpoolDash: hope your computer can handle it
<Shizuka> 13the magic of HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
<Dark92Enigma^> lol
<DocSane> The magic of bullshit
<SilverStrength> Zecora's doorstops are imba
<Dark92Enigma^> HAAAAAAAAAAAACX
<Trollestia> HOW DID THEY CHANGE THEIR EYES??????
<gamax92> im confused
<Dark92Enigma^> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
<MadSurge> PERFECT TROLLING
<XylemTube> The magic of somke and mirrors
<QBAlchemist> ofcoursE!
<CrystalPhoenix> Trollestia, Rarity's magic contact lense of course
<AJIsAwesome> It's Pinkie Pie. Don't question it.
<PresidentGanjalf> Noo, that was the magic of cheating!
<Trollestia> Shizuka: Truer words were never spoken
<Nittany_Discord> Friendship!
<aniderp> now kiss
<Trollestia> :D
<PresidentGanjalf> Yay!
<Azuredragon> Horses
<Kencolt> Big Mac. The first pony CANON CROSSDRESSER. Okay, even for the HUB that's walking a line.
<QBAlchemist> awww
<cool_brony> wth
<QBAlchemist> :(
<Shizuka> 13and then a spike x fluttershy ship was launched
<gamax92> This episode just stopped making sense.
<RawketLawnchair> I like those Saddle Arabia horses.
<Trollestia> CrystalPhoenix: HAAAAAAAAX
<Starlight_Phoenix> I think Pinkie Pie is the essence of magic
*AttackWithHugs throws a computer monitor at Twilight
<J_E_Smith71> I like this. Twilight beat Trixie by outwitting her instead of using some one shot magic charm power up thingie
<MadSurge> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, RawketLawnchair.
<Dark92Enigma^> YES YES YES
<Shizuka> 13we just need trixie to interact with a pony named bob
<Trollestia> Starlight_Phoenix: WRONG, SHE IS THE ESSENCE OF THE UNIVERSE
<desertman2> Who are those 2?
<Eddmario> Too bad we never actually heard the delegates from Saddle Arabia speak...
<Buytoast> don't forgive it
<gamax92> no no no no no no no trixie cannot be nice
<QBAlchemist> very out of character :/
<diddutz> CrystalPhoenix: But they change everything BUT their eyes
<Tovler> James from Team Rocket crossdressed and nobody even noticed
<BladedWings> daaaaaw look at dat faaace :(
<DocSane> More importantly, this puts a cap on Twi's powers.
<Trollestia> GODDAMNIT TRIXIE
<aniderp> now kiss trixie twilight
<MadSurge> Great and Apologetic :D
<QBAlchemist> not really
<gamax92> this is fake
<CriticKitten> NO
<CriticKitten> :D
<AlienWarhead> This is rushed, but I thinks it works
<QBAlchemist> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> she Does sound a bit off
<XylemTube> derp
<QBAlchemist> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> Now trixie is friendship.
<BladedWings> faceplant
<alexxm|foal> no
<gamax92> okay thanks
<RawketLawnchair> Trip
<AJIsAwesome> Dat trip
<AlienWarhead> ouch
<CrystalPhoenix> diddutz, rarity has a lot of different contact lenses
<Kencolt> Tovler: James was insanely good at it, though.
<MadSurge> And pratfall
<AttackWithHugs> trip
<Trollestia> FACEPLANT
<AJIsAwesome> ...
<MadSurge> AND BEST ENDING LD
<Trollestia> BEST PART EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<QBAlchemist> :D:D:D:D
<Azuredragon> What 4th wall?
<anton> this time pinkie and twilight breaks the 4th wall
<MadSurge> :D
<PresidentGanjalf> fail:D
<alexxm|foal> nope
<CrystalPhoenix> I love that ending
<Starlight_Phoenix> :D
<Cypresswolf> :D Pinkie Pie! *Inhales* The End! :D Best Ending!
<GilDash> 4th Wall breach! WARNING!
<Trollestia> HORY SHIT PINKIE
<Trollestia> WHAAAAAAAT
<AJIsAwesome> Welp, Twilight knows about the 4th wall now.
<PresidentGanjalf> :D
<CriticKitten> And that's how this episode was ruined :D
<Jageman> Backstage
<BladedWings> lol Pinkie :D
<Welsh_Pony> I liked the ending, never saw trixie as an evil character
<J_E_Smith71> Aweome ep/10
<AttackWithHugs> Woo
<Ryunosuke> !cd
<Tom> Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 6 days, 13 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Trollestia> THAT FOURTH WALL IS GOOOOOOOONE
<thelonepony> that ending reminded me of a show,,,
<DocSane> And Pinkie Pie Says Goodnight is now canon
<desertman2> Best episode ever so far
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<twilight_sprinkle> also, twilight can also break 4th wall now
<QBAlchemist> but the pink dummy ranger didnt get a chance to finnish her intro again!
<Starlight_Phoenix> what 4th wall?
<thelonepony> cant remeber
<BladedWings> Loved this episode 10/10
<Dashie_Dashie> 10/10
<Ryunosuke> this gets me curious
<Eddmario> desertman2: Well, of s3 anyway...
<desertman2> 20/10
<Trollestia> DocSane: That's all folks!
<Ryunosuke> o/ Shizuka
<thelonepony> remember*
<J_E_Smith71> What'd you think Shizuka?
<sub06905> trixie tripped/10
<Jageman> they did not break the forth wall, they just went backstage
<twilight_sprinkle> was an awesome ep, true
<gamax92> So, can someone tell me what the hell all that painting of ponies was about?
<Dark92Enigma^> OK.....THAT WAS MORE OVER THE TOP than i thought.......but I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<aniderp> fireplace!
<alexxm|foal> thanks Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka. :)
<GilDash> Shizuka: Thanks for stepping in. ^_^
<sub06905> tnx for stream Shizuka
<PresidentGanjalf> BTW: Took over the Ponyville and established a dictatorship. Let her go.
<gamax92> Because I have no clue what that was about.
<AttackWithHugs> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka
<Tovler> If Trixie's corruption was more distinct, it would have been better. Possessed by horcrux Sombra would have made it 10/10
<Ponies47> Thankies for stream Shizuka
<thelonepony> Thanks for streaming Shizuka :)
<Starlight_Phoenix> good stream shizuka
<Cypresswolf> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka :)
<BladedWings> Thanks for the amazing stream Shizuka ^_^
<DocSane> gamax92: They painted Granny Smith, Apple Bloom, and Big Mac as AJ doubles.
<AttackWithHugs> Shizuka, also extra thanks for stepping in for Euro BMN
<twilight_sprinkle> gamax92: she repainted the CMC to look like filyl rarity/aj and repainted big mac to look like male applejack
<Kencolt> Still... Big Macintosh, Equestria's first canon crossdresser. Which is really impressive when you realise that they DON'T WEAR CLOTHES.
<RawketLawnchair> gamax92: Twilight couldn't preform age spells and the like, so she used her friends to fool Trixie into thinking she could with that amulet, making her take hers off.
<Jageman> good stream
<thelonepony> i'm still a bit suprise of what happen today
<DocSane> gamax92: And painted Sweetie Belee to look like Rarity.
<QBAlchemist> Thankyou Shizuka :)
<gamax92> oh i get it.
<Hiro> that would be like sombra would be a villain throughout the enitre season
<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: Thanks for the stream, now what do you think of the Pilot, the Wedding Episode and Today's one?
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<AlienWarhead> Kencolt: HAHAHA
<Brother_Aura> wtf
<AJIsAwesome> What happened, thelonepony?
<thelonepony> about LC
<Shizuka> 13that sequence with the fake amulet will take some freeze framing
<Dark92Enigma^> Shizuka: you made my day better! (hugs you)
<thelonepony> i meant
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershy is still a bitch.
<Shizuka> 13i'm sure the eye colors all show a la rarity in sisterhooves
<PresidentGanjalf> thank you very much for the stream Shizuka:)
<gamax92> Sombra is so undeveloped as a charachter.
<MadSurge> BaconMane|AFK is best troll :D
<Brother_Aura> wat ees thes?
<Tovler> So all the apples were painted like AJ except AJ
<Trollestia> Video game sequence?
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<twilight_sprinkle> actually no, she became a genuine one in this ep
<gamax92> its just like, "This is bad guy, he does bad things."
<AlienWarhead> Kencolt no wait Twilight cross dressed for nightmare night
<BladedWings> Brother_Aura: Shizu's outro
<alexxm|foal> thanks Shizuka
<Trollestia> What did you expect Tovler
<thelonepony> he was fucking around with our minds and stuff :D
<kirz|steam> r63 spells now canon
<Brother_Aura> Pretty long.
<Shizuka> 13still means r63 is canon
<gamax92> portal!
<DocSane> For some reason, girls cross-dressing is okay.
<twilight_sprinkle> "alicorn" is also a canon word now
<Eli> trolling is pointless and stupid. no matter who does it
<Tovler> Adventure Time's r63 is better
<Kencolt> AlienWarhead: Well, technically, but no-onje was meant to be fooled. Heck, no-one-- or almost no-one knew what it was.
<sub06905> no
<gamax92> alicorn wasn't canon?
<PresidentGanjalf> AlienWarhead: Hallow-i mean Nightmare Night doesn't count
*RDash5000 claps
<RawketLawnchair> Shizuka: I dunno. Age spells, sure. R63 spells, not so much.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: but more incredible, Meanwhile DIDN'T hate the episode!
<RDash5000> gamax92: nope
<Brother_Aura> do rozen maiden.
<twilight_sprinkle> thx for streaming
<Brother_Aura> I like rozen maiden.
<Shizuka> 13nope
<thelonepony> MadSurge: and with taht, i want to ship him with Triwie
<Eli> MadSurge: :O impossible :P
<Shizuka> 13wrek time
<Brother_Aura> or dreaming.
<AJIsAwesome> I know, right? :D
<gamax92> my entire life was a lie.
<thelonepony> trixie*
<Trollestia> Thanks Shizuka! It was awesome!!
<pony_4908> Lauren Faust originally was quoted with using "Unicorn", but once "Alicorn" caught on in the fandom, the show crew just went with that.
<Tovler> Thanks for staying stable, Cox Cable
<Shizuka> 13my series will be tomorrow or later tonight maybe
<DocSane> Now give us an episode where Rarity and AJ really get turned to kids and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle learn about the responsibilities of being a good older sister.
<Brother_Aura> With that outro?
<Brother_Aura> It scares me.
<AlienWarhead> night BronyState
<Trollestia> Hey Wrek. Ready for a great stream :D
<BladedWings> nite AlienWarhead
<twilight_sprinkle> bye AlienWarhead
<J_E_Smith71> Thanks for stepping up Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> Night, AlienWarhead. :)
<AlienWarhead> :$
<Wrek> 051 sec then!
<thelonepony> welp gonna do some "stuff" atm <_<
<MadSurge> Hell, I don't hate Trixie anymore! And she was the worst pony!
<twilight_sprinkle> i just love the element of kindness threatened to hurt her friend in that ep
<Brother_Aura> Wait...
<Brother_Aura> Wrek?
<LadyCanary> Yay ~
<J_E_Smith71> So Shizuka what's your verdict on the new ep?
<Kencolt> Wait. Does Big Mac make a hu7nky Appejack, or does Applejack make a cute Big Mac? That just hit me.
<cratorkid> DocSane: Thats actualy a preety dope idea
<Brother_Aura> I fear no mod.
<BladedWings> twilight_sprinkle: that was funny and a little scary lol
<Shizuka> 13was good, felt short
<Brother_Aura> But that... THING...
<Brother_Aura> It scares me...
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah it was a lot to fit in 20 mins
<DocSane> cratorkid: I picture young Rarity as having a totally different personality from adult Rarity.
<Shizuka> 13they probably could have easily made that a two parter
<BladedWings> Kencolt: i think its the first one
<twilight_sprinkle> that couldve been a two pa-
<DocSane> cratorkid: Since Rarity's personality was entirely invented by herself.
<Kencolt> DocSane: That's kind of a given. "STUPID ROCK!"
<Trollestia> Shizuka: Where'd be the fun in that?
<Buytoast> what happened to that ponies person
<Shizuka> 13they could spend half of one ep building up "someone's terrorizing the town"
<Shizuka> 13reveal it to be trixie
<AttackWithHugs> Wait how do all these ships get started? I'm lost.
<Shizuka> 13ep ends with twilight being banished
<DocSane> So, it'd be funny seeing Sweetie dealing with a bratty Rarity who's totally un-ladylike.
<Brother_Aura> Desu... Is a sin, in his presence...
<Shizuka> 13next ep starts with twi going to zecora, spend more time on the training arc
<cratorkid> DocSane: nods* now that im thinking, they will still be blank flanks
<Shizuka> 13then come back and win
<Kencolt> Well, at least "On a Cross and an Arrow" has a semi-canon character model for IT'S Applejack. :P
<Tovler> Maybe Twilight could meet up with Timon and Pumbaa
<twilight_sprinkle> hm i would the reveal would have to happen within 10 mins, and the rest would be the new regime of ponyville and training of twi
<AJIsAwesome> I have no idea.
<sub06905> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_med1ggnyyT1rc2ye5o1_1280.jpg
<Shizuka> 13but given the characterization failure of sombra
<twilight_sprinkle> *would think
<Shizuka> 13feel like the writers this season are getting complacent
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Make the first duel a bit more epic
<gamax92> Shizuka: Could it be aranged that instead of two episodes? it would be a 44minute episode?
<BladedWings> Wrek stream is up ^_^
<QBAlchemist> what did people think of cinderella dance scene?
<SpeccyRush> they turmed out to be BaconMane|AFK trolling everyone Buytoast
<GilDash> They certainly neeed more time with their episodes... but that said, the Royal Wedding was handled really, really well, and that was both parts.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: that image is cut off, heres the full one https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YmvWzX81qmY/ULpjEjaMlJI/AAAAAAAANig/FNi73JgHmxo/s1600/PublicServiceMessage.png
<Buytoast> ah
<Brother_Aura> Wrek sessions... With a google chrome theme!
<Brother_Aura> It is the bane of my existance...
<aniderp> thanks for stream shizu :>
<DocSane> cratorkid: You could even make the episode grow out of this one, with Twilight being inspired to try a real age spell and then not being able to reverse it immediately.
<Shizuka> 13the problem is the royal wedding was completely ignoring the moral of Lesson Zero
<Cypresswolf> I think Sombre was supposed to be a Sauron like villain
<LadyCanary> Wreky stream <3
<Shizuka> 13<3
<twilight_sprinkle> royal wedding felt more like pew pew than morals
<gamax92> I must be miss informed, whats Wrek's stream
<twilight_sprinkle> i still liked it tho ofc
<cratorkid> DocSane: i was thinkig the same, then maybe on of them doesnt want to change back?
<Cypresswolf> given a bit more solid writing, he could have been
<Brother_Aura> LadyCanary What is happy about this, THING?
<Buytoast> B-b-but Shizuka, there was a differnt Princess involved!
<GilDash> Twilight was too eager to confront Cadence. She should have talked privately first.
<LadyCanary> What thing, Brother_Aura
<Buytoast> A-a-and a wedding!
<DocSane> cratorkid: You could do that, too.
<Brother_Aura> I can's say it out loud..
<Shizuka> 13it was a duplicate of Lesson Zero with the stakes turned up for them failing to listen to twi
<Brother_Aura> I will be banned for 12 seconds!
<BladedWings> we found derpy ^_^ http://cheezburger.com/6830343168
<Kencolt> Sombra wasn't entirely... there. Unlike Nightmare Moon or Discord, or even Chrysalis, he was less a villain with a mind, and almost a memory-- as they said, a shadow.
<Brother_Aura> *can't
<LadyCanary> That "thing" happens to be my special somepony Brother_Aura
<SpeccyRush> MadSurge: Meanwhile not hating the episode even though it's trixie? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q9TYUr-Teo

<DocSane> cratorkid: And then it'd end with her realizing she already grew up once before and had a life and career.
<twilight_sprinkle> lel
*Brother_Aura got away with his Run Away!
<Tovler> hm, so Arabs are horses. I wander what animal South Americans will be.
<Buytoast> well ya got me good
<DocSane> cratorkid: As always, Applejack and Apple Bloom would be totally sidelined.
<Buytoast> but it was nice having someone specific to hate
<Shizuka> 13PO TA TO
<Tovler> pink alpacas
<Jageman> lol
<MadSurge> SpeccyRush: I'd like to know where that image comes from :D
<Kencolt> Tovler: I think the Saddle Arabians were ponies-- just a bit taller thyan average.
<gamax92> 404: Internet not found.
<SpeccyRush> ya couldn't get me bercinmern
<cratorkid> DocSane: lol, poor orange side pony
<MadSurge> BaconMane|AFK: I missed your trolling :(
<Jageman> wtf did i just see
<Punkie_Pue> They didn't have cutiemarks though.
<DocSane> cratorkid: They're too well-adjusted. AJ would just want to grow up again so she could get back to work and support the family.
<LadyCanary> YES THIS VID
<DocSane> cratorkid: And Apple Bloom loves her as a big sister.
<Ryunosuke> oh god
<Cypresswolf> Jageman: traditional Bronystate content
<Tovler> but… the Arabian Horse Society and heckuva job, Brownie
<Ryunosuke> poniator is done already
<Ryunosuke> brb
<gamax92> oh is it streaming, it says offline for me
<cratorkid> DocSane: not to mention she likes the cmc, and would need to help the farm rather then hang out with them
<Wrek> 05hit play
<DocSane> cratorkid: I think I just wrote a fan fic here.
<Jageman> crash
<cratorkid> DocSane: will you write it?
<Buytoast> After seeing the way they brutally treated animals for their own twisted amusement, the Saddle Arabians purged the world of the wicked, sinful influence of Queen Horse's Nightmare Kingdom.
<Ryunosuke> HOLY
<Ryunosuke> By Celestia's beard!
<DocSane> cratorkid: Oh, God no. I hate most fan fic.
<BladedWings> oh...my
<RawketLawnchair> Tovler: I think the reason Saddle Arabian pones look like they do is because there aren't as magical-ish as Equestrian pones.
<AttackWithHugs> Whaa
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: this is the part where i say "is that....SPOILER??" 24 hr is still up
<Brony_ponies> hey bronies! Did you know that spike has a crush of rarity?!

*gamax92 doesn't look at chat for spoilers
<DocSane> cratorkid: I wish I could draw, because it'd probably make a good comic.
<twilight_sprinkle> one of the gel songs i think
<Brony_ponies> WHEN I GROW UP, I WANNA BE A PONY!
<Tovler> RawketLawnchair: Things that look horse like aren't magical? I don't get the syllogism here.

<Brony_ponies> I just learned that the moon comes in the night!
<Shizuka> 13awwwwwwww
<twilight_sprinkle> Brony_ponies: you can see it during the day too sometimes
<Ryunosuke> Engi x Turret
<RawketLawnchair> Tovler: There's not as much need for weather control or magic in Saddle Araiba, which is why they look like more normal horses, rather than the short pones of Equestira.
<MadSurge> Sooo, what now? Another stream incoming?
<Kencolt> It's... like like a loyal puppy that isn't lethal but help with it.
<Brony_ponies> Did you know that spike has a crush on rarity?

<aniderp> wrek what kind of tablet you use?
<DoctoDoctorWho> What is the best way to make an OC without pony creator?
<PrincessLollipopGear> wait, AJIsAwesome is the one drawing?
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: piece of paper
<AJIsAwesome> No.
<Haku1013> Doctor-Whooves I dont have an actual cutie mark on him, sadly.
<cachi01> DoctoDoctorWho: drawing it
<Dublh> lol HEY WREK.....put on sum dubstem er something XD
<Doctor-Whooves> Haku1013, do you want it coloured too? or just drawn?
<Yahooz> DoctoDoctorWho: thats your preference
<axadentel> creativity and time doctodocterwho
<Dublh> NYAN CAT... that would be awsome
<AJIsAwesome> No no no no no. I can't draw worth anything, PrincessLollipopGear. :D
<gamax92> DoctoDoctorWho: piece of paper, tons of time and patience, and then a scanner.
<Anime_Brony> Twilight Or Trixie?
<DinkyDoo> ALLONS-Y
<PrincessLollipopGear> I printed out how to draw reference sheets
<AJIsAwesome> PrincessLollipopGear: It's Wrek that's drawing. :)
<Anime_Brony> Who is better,twilight or trixie?
<Haku1013> Doctor-Whooves What ever floats your boat. If you can, give hima broken crown for a cutie mark, please.
<Yahooz> Wrek doesnt do dubstep, the only thing remotely close to that is Swedish House Mafia
<PrincessLollipopGear> AJIsAwesome, oh sorry XD
<AJIsAwesome> Nah, it's cool. :D
<gamax92> Also I can't draw worth crap.
<Yahooz> that he plays, that is
