<WallDives> hi flutter__shy.
<Invi> flutter__shy = sweetie__belle?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Probably
<flutter__shy> ya (troll face)
<Airpuff> GilDash: Well, being a god and all, i have SOME weak points. xD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> legit
<SayWhat> -__-, funny thing. I need to play Modern WArfare 3 to get my friend to play League of Legends. And if I can get him to play League, my other friend will watch an episode of MLP. It's a vicious circle
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Vicious indeed

<Airpuff> There!
*Bronysith|Pirate force chokes Woodenfan
<flutter__shy> :O
<SayWhat> R/B was best pony
<Invi> Woodenfan what G5?
<Woodenfan> I don't like B/W at all. I've played it 3 times, and every time I find myself liking it less and less
<Bronysith|Pirate> i find your lack of faith disturinbg Woodenfan
<alexxm> flutter__shy type /me if your doing actions
<flutter__shy> oh lol ok
<SayWhat> Invi: Black and White XD
<WallDives> Woodenfan: G3 G4 G5 G1 G2
<SayWhat> Invi: Dude, it's been out for awhile
<otakon> brb again guys
*flutter__shy moans
<Bronysith|Pirate> who here has played demons souls?
<Bronysith|Pirate> anypone
<Bronysith|Pirate> pony
<GilDash> Airpuff: It doesn't have to end there. ;)
<Woodenfan> g2 is awesome that's my second favorite for a reason, but I grew up with Emerald, that game is still my favorite of all time
*flutter__shy is bored and watching [MashUP] The FRESH Prince of RAINBOW Factory
<Invi> SayWhat oh lol I don't like them
<Manearion> STLL HERE
<Manearion> *STILL
<SayWhat> The first pokemon I played was Silver. And I still play it
<alexxm> i played the first 3 gens but didn't get a DS
<WallDives> the only good things to me that came out of G3 was Abilities and Breloom.
<Bronysith|Pirate> HAS ANYPONY HERE?!?! played demons souls?
<WallDives> and Swampert.
<SayWhat> I brought it in a gameboy color to school one day and just was sittin in math class
<Manearion> Just had to sit and draw for a bit~
<SayWhat> Playing pokemon
*Airpuff giggles at GilDash "Really now?"
<Manearion> But there is the glory of two screens
<Darkts3> dat fun
<GilDash> Airpuff: If you think you're up for it? ;)
*flutter__shy me gusta
<WallDives> SayWhat: Heart Gold/Soul Silver is a pretty good remake.
<Manearion> I have been able to see ya'll all the time!
<Woodenfan> Here's one reason I don't like B/W: The animations are really REALLY boring. Most of the time it's them hopping around in a continual loop! To the other gen's credit, even though it was really short, the animations caught my eye and were pleasing. B/W's don't.
<Invi> SayWhat G1 was designed to be about 200 pokemon instead of 150
<Manearion> HAHA
<Manearion> h that~
*Airpuff looks at GilDash "Please.. I'm a god?"
<WallDives> Invi: about 170.
<Manearion> *Oh
<SayWhat> WallDives: Yeah but it didn't have the same 'appeal' that it used to
<DaringDude> i liek dis sing :3
<Invi> WallDives not 200?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm currently working my way through Crystal on an GBC emulator on my phone
<Saturn> 08,01it's really fun!
<Bronysith|Pirate> hello Saturn
<SayWhat> Sheeit
<Saturn> 08,01i got bored of Red
<GilDash> Airpuff: Prove it. :)
<Litwick> How is it Saturn?
<SayWhat> Hi Saturn
<WallDives> Invi: not really. There were a few scrapped, but theres slots for aprox 170 in the coding for R/G.
<Litwick> What's your team so far?
<WallDives> Also, the first pokemon ever created (and is my favorite) is Rhydon.
<Saturn> 08,01i can't remember
<Woodenfan> Another reason I don't like B/W: It feels too much like R/B, a generation that I'm not particularly fond of (it's way too buggy and the pokemon get generic). To B/W's credit, they did a TON of research, but still, I'm not digging the new Pokemon at all. No relations to old ones, that's one reason I liked Gen 4 somewhat.
<Saturn> 08,01i've jsut started out
<alexxm> hows it going so far Saturn
<Litwick> Starter?
<SayWhat> I have super smash bros 64 still. It's worth like 40 bucks
<Bronysith|Pirate> my team is. mewtwo, mewtwo, mewtwo, mewtwo and mewtwo
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: it's certainly much better than Red
<WallDives> Woodenfan: its supposed to, since its supposed to be a reboot of sorts.
<SayWhat> And Mario Kart 64
<WallDives> Bronysith|Pirate: illegal team, go!
<Woodenfan> I know, but it shouldn't have been!
<flutter__shy> :'(
<Airpuff> GilDash: ....... hmpf. :P
<Litwick> Saturn, who did you choose for your starter?
<DaringDude> dat hair curl
<Saturn> 08,01and it's really fun to play on my phone, because my phone has a physical keyboard!
<Manearion> Your manes Teglo!
<Saturn> 08,01Litwick: the fire one, i think
<WallDives> Woodenfan: why not? they spent more time on the story. and where else where they going to go?
<GilDash> Airpuff: Oh, is that a no from my "god"? :p
<Manearion> They are amazinbg!
*Abra appeared!
*Bronysith|Pirate slices off Abra s head
<Bronysith|Pirate> i hate pokemon
<Woodenfan> The postgame is awful as well. I don't want to fight level 60+ basic evolutions, it's really boring
*WallDives sent out Murkrow
<WallDives> Woodenfan: I'll give you that.
*Invi throws Pokeball at Abra
*Abra it's super effective!
*Abra boop
<SayWhat> Use your Thunder Smash! PIKA PEEEE
*Abra boop
<Woodenfan> The exp scalar curve is alright, but it gets grating because I like to be overleveled.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Who said it was a no? xD
*Abra escaped from the pokeball
*Bronysith|Pirate force chokes Abra
*Abra cast teleport!

<DaringDude> lol
<WallDives> also, favorite pokemon game : Pokemon Stadium.

<Airpuff> GilDash: what if im teasing you? :)
<WallDives> Woodenfan: YES.
*SayWhat is evolving. Congratulations! All your bass are belong to us! *Queue happy music*

<DaringDude> opbow opbow bay
<Woodenfan> I also hate team plasma. They're like cipher, sans the motivation. Cipher was legitimately terrifying, for the place they inhabited was really creepy and set the tone well. Here, Plasma...ugh, SHOULD'VE GONE SHADOW POKEMON ON THEIR ASSES. And Wall

<Yahooz> Meanwhile: no big suprise
<Woodenfan> anyone want to PM?
<DaringDude> Hat: kinda i find it harder to draw ona tablet cause it seens like u dont have as much control but it makes dawing a lot easier with layers and the all holy undo button'
<GilDash> Airpuff: I don't want you to try. I want you to go through. ;)
<WallDives> Invi: I know, what I was asking was if you beat the R2 version of Stadium 2.

<Saturn> 08,01Also, you should be aware that Rationalism is quite a spooky philosophy. People that are Rationalists try to act rationally all the time, they believe there is only one right thing to do - the right thing - for a given goal and set of beliefs.

<alexxm> whats the songs name
<alexxm> cya otakon
<SayWhat> idk
<owlicious> but we really, really could be using the iron in your body for paperclips
<WallDives> this sounds pirate'y.
<Invi> Saturn can a AI without aims exsist?
<Saturn> 08,01i think AI is a fascinating subject, and one of the *best* things to write about in speculative fiction (along with time travel), so long as it's done well (same with time travel)
<Litwick> I'm going into food studies next year. Should be fun.
<DaringDude> Saturn are we talking about AI in general or like a specific case because my standpoint on different AI is different for the different tasks they are performing
<CupcakeWarrior> We wouldnt need to worry about AI taking over if we lived in Equestria
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: that is actually a tough question
<Invi> Litwick i would be afraid of the results
<Saturn> 08,01and i think it depends on how one defines intelligence
<DaringDude> ^
<Woodenfan> I'll always be here even up to my death
<Litwick> Invi: EXPLODING KITCHENS GOOD SIR. EXPLODING KITCHENS.
<CupcakeWarrior> I get to do advanced placement english next year
<SayWhat> :D Keelhaul that filthy landlubber, send him down to the depths below!Make that bastard﻿ walk the plank, with a bottle of rum and a yo-ho-ho!
<Saturn> 08,01some would define intelligence as rationonality, which is taking the adequate steps to achieve one's goals in accordance with one's beliefs
*CupcakeWarrior burns Litwick's kitchen down as a precaution
<DaringDude> capacity for learning, reasoning, understanding, and similar forms of mental activity; aptitude in grasping truths, relationships, facts, meanings, etc.2.manifestation of a high mental capacity: He writes with intelligence and wit.3.the faculty of understanding.4.knowledge of an event, circumstance, etc., received or imparted; news; information.5.the gathering or distribution of information, especially secret informa
<Wrek> 05without you
<DaringDude> dammit
<Litwick> Nuuuuuuuu
<Wrek> 05withouy you
<CupcakeWarrior> JESUS
<Wrek> 05there's nothign to hold on to~
<SayWhat> Wall
*DaringDude hangs his head in shame
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Wrek, why?
<Saturn> 08,01and there's symbolic AI, which takes a model of a physical system, and represents it as a system of symbols that may be manipulated using formal rules
<CupcakeWarrior> Hai FlareChaser
<FlareChaser> CupcakeWarrior: hello...?
<Saturn> 08,01a symbolic AI system without a goal is essentially useless
<Manearion> This song
<Manearion> So swag!
<Ponies47> swag
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02INB4 KICK
<DaringDude> ?
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh wow
<Saturn> 08,01i think i'm going to go with no on that, Invi
<alexxm> Wrek just out of intrest whats the name of the pirate song you just played
<owlicious> Saturn: do you mean symbols like boxes in warehouse, or facts...
<Yahooz> lolwut
<GilDash> Saturn: What goals would a rational AI conjur up I wonder?
<DerpStar> hey everypony
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey DerpStar
<alexxm> hey DerpStar hows your day been
<Meanwhile> Allo DerpStar.
<Invi> Saturn can't it define goals on it's own?
<owlicious> I thought you would make the AI to fulfill those goals
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: it depends on its initial goals and beliefs, and whether it can modify these
<DerpStar> Its been good alexxm and yours?
<DaringDude> Hai DerpStar :D
*CupcakeWarrior glomps SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai ^-7
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<Invi> moin SuperBrony64
<Saturn> 08,01owlicious: symbols as in abstract representations of physical manifestations of objects
*SuperBrony64 hugs CupcakeWarrior back
<GilDash> Saturn: Let's assume it has the capability to adjust itself as it sees necessary.
<Saturn> 08,01owlicious: symbols in a formal sense
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: holy crap hes talking!
<CupcakeWarrior> Moo
<prince-dari> Saturn: What if you have an AI with the purpose to destroy another AI, whose purpose is simply to exist (in other words not be destroyed)? XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<alexxm> good DerpStar i'm doing an article about bronies for my college course
<SayWhat> Hi SB

<Ponies47> Noms on cookie. Thanks DerpStar!
<DerpStar> neat alexxm college is lots of fun
*SuperBrony64 takes a cookie and noms on it
<DaringDude> Saturn: may the best AI win
*SayWhat steals SB's cookie
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: Moo
<owlicious> you have that in games, for non conscious specialized ais.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02alexxm: It cool ^_^
<FlareChaser> ...I feel REALLY guilty now :|
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: have you ever heard of evolutionary-based software fuzzers?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...but....that was my cookie ;~;
<Invi> Saturn can't the AI define goals on it's own?
*SayWhat and splits it in half.
<prince-dari> No, sounds interesting.
*Meanwhile hands SuperBrony64 another cookie.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<Ponies47> FlareChaser: How come?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives SuperBrony64 a dozen cookies.
<DaringDude> Wait would an AI thats function is to survive kill another that wass trying to terminate it?
*SuperBrony64 noms on cookies
*DerpStar hands out another cookie to SuperBrony64
<owlicious> if it could, sure
*OmegaMetroidBrony hands SuperBrony64 a taco.
<FlareChaser> Ponies47: I sorta...paid someone in points to draw a certain...photo.... :|
<Meanwhile> Surrender your cookies to our cookie overlord.
*SayWhat assaults SB with cookies.
<Saturn> 08,01they're basically tools that employ machine learning to find bugs in software, by introducing random inputs
<Woodenfan> Wow, I just Pokegushed there...oops
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought SB was the cow overlord
<SayWhat> Moo
<Saturn> 08,01although, these are directed, and with a goal (hence, machine learnign)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Cookies? Thats a funny way to spell Tacos :3

<CCCP> I had to make squirrel noises as Bubbles and without realizing it, I was making the face and putting my fingers up to my face to look like a squirrel and everyone made fun of me for the rest of the day. - tara strong
<Q> dem pings
<Woodenfan> ehhhhhh freaking dusty desert killed my ring streak again
<CCCP> real quote
<Woodenfan> Trying to get higher scores (I've gotten all S-ranks already)
<Q> Woodenfan: shit ranks?
<Manearion> >Caring about haters
<Manearion> Prfft!
<Woodenfan> no
<DaringDude> Woodenfan: its not to hard to get S rank in that game
<Q> Woodenfan: stupid ranks?
<Saturn> 08,01i love this definition:
<Woodenfan> Q: S-ranks
<Manearion> Haters
<Saturn> 08,01“Artificial Intelligence is the study of techniques for solving exponentially hard problems in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem domain”
<Manearion> Are entertainment!
<Q> Woodenfan: so stupid ranks?
<Woodenfan> oh forget it Q
<Saturn> 08,01it makes me chuckle
<Invi> CCCP tara says a lot when the day is long
<Woodenfan> eeeeh
<CCCP> Invi: tara is best pony
<Invi> ikr? ^^
<Manearion> ^
<DaringDude> exploting knowledge
<Bronysith> CCCP: well she does voice twilight
<Woodenfan> Sonic is fun though
<Manearion> But as far as voice acting goes
<CCCP> Bronysith: yes she does
<Saturn> 08,01DaringDude: what of it?
<Manearion> Tabitha St. Germaine is a bloody GODESS
<Woodenfan> Hey speaking of, did you know that Tara's voicing the cheerleader in Lollipop Chainsaw?
<Saturn> 08,01Manearion: well why don't you just go marry her then!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<Saturn> 08,01if you love her so much
<Manearion> <w<
<Bronysith> Woodenfan: 0_0
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Twilight Sparkle: Chainsaw Cheerleader
<Manearion> Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Woodenfan: yeah, i saw that
<flutter__shy> ausidg]
<CupcakeWarrior> Tara is married to all the bronies
<Manearion> You are probably a real nice bloke you are
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior: i love her
<Saturn> 08,01Woodenfan: it was creepy hearing Twilight's voice
<Woodenfan> Tabitha St. Germain is freaking awesome as rarity, I'm still wondering what made her think Derpy was a little boy
<Manearion> But I just don't know you that well yet....
<Woodenfan> Saturn: it was creepy hearing Twilight swear, ya know?
<CupcakeWarrior> Lollipop chainsaw?
<Saturn> 08,01Woodenfan: yeah
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats that?
<Woodenfan> yeah look it up
<Woodenfan> It's freaking nuts
<DaringDude> exploiting is a strangely humanistic trait
<Manearion> ANYHOOF
<Woodenfan> Actually, the cheerleader looks like Stocking
<Bronysith> Manearion: yes
<CCCP> Don't be afraid to look silly. - tara strong
<Woodenfan> from the show Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt
<GilDash> Woodenfan: I'd assume whoever passed her the scrip derped up.
<Manearion> I find it interesting that Vinyl
<Manearion> and Gordon Freeman
<Woodenfan> you're right GilDash
<Manearion> Has the same voice actress
<BAppleJuice> ARTZ
<Bronysith> Manearion: lol
<DaringDude> Saturn i scanned ur AI document i didnt understand much but it seems like a cool concept for testing programs
<Litwick> pfffft Manearion.
<Bronysith> i can roleplay as chell, gordon freeman, crono, all in one go
<GilDash> Woodenfan: Actually, I think I remember Tabitha stating that she was told Derpy was a boy, so... :S
<Woodenfan> I still think a Derpycentric episode should be in order and it should have the moral: Even though you might look different, your friends still love you. That'd be a great lesson for the kids
<Woodenfan> Yeah, stuff happens
<Bronysith> Woodenfan: yea it would
<CCCP> tara strong is wise
<Bronysith> tara strong is awesome
<Woodenfan> Anyone seen Twilightlicious?
<Bronysith> Woodenfan: who hasnt?
<Woodenfan> and Flutterlicio-HNNNNNNNNNGH oh god
<Manearion> Tara Strong is TWILIGHTLICIOUS
<CupcakeWarrior> If there was a Derpy episode, they wouldnt name her Derpy in it

<Sally> Hi ,
<Sally> We have 2 Persian Kittens available now for adoption .the kittens are home raised , well socialized with kids and also get along perfectly with other house pets . They are pure breed Persian Kittens CFA registered have health warranty ,Litter box trained, , smart and cuddling. They are updated on all their shots and will come along with 3 year health guarantee.They love to be carried around and cuddled and full of caressing and kiss
<Sally> es because They are still Kittens . Their Names are Mickey and Daisy,male and female Respectively and all 11 weeks olds .
<Sally> The reason i am giving them out is because they formerly belonged to my father but he died just some few weeks back in a car accident when he was coming back from work. so i don't like to see them around me anymore because they make me to think of my father's dead and in addition is the fact that pets are not allowed in this new apartment and we have been given a maximum of 2 weeks to look MICKEY and DAISY a new home,that is why i will
<Manearion> Excactly!
<DaringDude> GilDash: yup
<Sally> like to give them out to a good animal loving home . i just want a good animal loving home for them and they will become yours forever, they are for free adoption. hope you understand. all you are required to pay is just the shipping fee of the Persian Kittens to your location which will cost in total 170$ for one and 320$ .
<rdibp> I wish someone would draw sumerpan /)^3^(\
<Sally> i am located in Minesota,MN and i am willing to have the Persian Kittens shipped to your home address . So, i will like to know the following from you :
<Sally> where are you located ? state , city ?
<Wrek> 05Manearion is even featured on mine :D
<Sally> have you ever owned a Persian Kitten before ?
<Bronysith> LordCelestia: nice job man
<Sally> do you have kids or anyone that can always play or take care of the Persian Kittens ?
<Sally> how soon do you want the Persian Kittens ?
<Manearion> 8D
<Sally> you have to promise me that you will take very good care of the Persian Kittens and send me photos regularly so that i can see how the MICKEY and DAISY are growing up with you in your house .
<Sally> Best Regards
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hehe, thanks
<Sally> expecting your response soon
<Sally> I told the person that I would like the kittens but couldnt pay the shipping fee
<Bronysith> LordCelestia: do one with the metal

<rdibp> HEY! how about a song?
<Golakka> All of 4 of my accoutns got logged
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Last time I check I had 200+ unread chapters :/
<Ponies47> Sketch_Toku_Brony: MINE IS MUCH WORSE! :[

<CupcakeWarrior> Im 5 foot 7 at 16 :(
<rdibp> :3:3

*OmegaMetroidBrony is now operating in *************
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane shoots OmegaMetroidBrony in both knees
<Sally> yeah, i am a tard
*CupcakeWarrior is dusted
<Woodenfan> Wonder what our generatioin's elderly citizens will be like (when we grow old)? I think we'll be more Internet savvy
*OmegaMetroidBrony is down.
<Ponies47> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Not that bad. But it's really bad! It's crashed on me atleast 4-5 times now X(
<rdibp> ponies will be in 3D for G5
<Golakka> If we live to our old ages, the way things are going, I really dont know.
<CupcakeWarrior> I bet we will LIVE in the internet in 100 years
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> rdibp: no 4d
<Kimori> lol
<mario_pony> they will be CGI
<owlicious> So, when do you think we'll have a live action mlp movie?

<Ponies47> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT CGI! I HATE CGI! :[

<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 He isn't unfortunately......he said that the clips he watched are cute but it's not his thing......however he added that if someone else is watching it, ''go on, i have no problem with it''
<mario_pony1> i watch it all the time
<DocSane> Ponies47: Not sure about the critic. Nostalgia Chick is definitely NOT.
<rdibp> okay brb guy, gonna take a shower
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> oh digimon oh how i love u
<Cypresswolf> I can't think of anymore possibilities for S3 bingo - I posted the first 40, I stopped at 43
<CupcakeWarrior> I liek ponies
<Golakka> what was that oscar wylde quote "When i grew up, I lost the fear of being childish"
<XAX> It was awesome. I didn't get a single bit of hate, and some people even said they respect me more. Not because theyre bronies though. My mates don't even know what bronies are. They respect me for having the courage to clip a pink pony to my bag when I go to an all boys school.
<mario_pony1> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have all the episodes in my PS3
<superretroworld> Ponies47: good question, he made a video saying please enjoy shows for little kids, but idk. but i do think chuggaonroys a brony

<Saturn> 08,01http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pelbf/
<Woodenfan> Never compare this awesome series to the movie
<emangamer> Sumica: I FUCKING CALLED IT. when I first watched it, remember? I said "why cant they bend metal, it's just earth" and then Toph did it and I'm like "I FUCKING KNEW IT!"
<Sumica> 00,10what movie?
<Dken2021> otakon getting shipped? better hook up with Saturn
<Rainbow-Crash> DONT TELL HIM

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat voice
<Phase4> nice voice
<Suinide> Hmm
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs emangamer
<otakon> emangamer: because they can't bend pure metal
<emangamer> otakon: they can
<superretroworld> wait a minute, i just did a while ago :D
<twilight_sprinkler> make sure the elderly are...taken care of
<Litwick> Dat voice is who you think it is.
<Sumica> 00,10but it's not platnum
<CupcakeWarrior> Lecherous: Having or showing excessive or offensive sexual desire. Yep, thats Saturn all right
<Sumica> 00,10it looks like pig iron
<Kencolt> Hi. I am your friend. I am a COMPLETE DICK, but I am you friend as long as you kiss my ass. And by friend I mean I will opress you and beat you down but I will be polit3e about it when I am not being a dick. So, we are all friends.
<otakon> emangamer: no, they can't. The metal has to be slightly impure for them to bend it.
<Litwick> Yes, IT'S CAVE JOHNSON.
<flutter_spin> platnum? Is the Ferengi around?
<emangamer> Sumica: I called it, didnt I?
<emangamer> otakon: nope, false
<Kencolt> Kinda sums it all of.
<Rainbow-Crash> Sumica: Toph hasn't invented metal bending yet
<twilight_sprinkler> music night!
<hen3ry> no, Ferengi use Latinum
<Suinide> Kimori?
<SparklyWaffles> Ooo SNAP
<Dken2021> I smell a riot
<otakon> emangamer: um, no you never watched the ep where Toph finally learned to Metal Bend have you?
<flutter_spin> well paint it gold then
<RyunosukeKnT> metalbending uses worked metal
<Kimori> hi
<DaringDude> dat courage
<CK|Ded> Metalbending doesn't exist yet. Also its a concept that has been slowly ruined since its creation. :/
<Sumica> 00,10in korra they say metal benders cant bend platnum cause it's too pure.
<Woodenfan> eeyup
<RyunosukeKnT> while earthbending uses unworked ore and rocks
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Suinide> Hey, sorry about last night....idk what came over me
<CK|Ded> Sumica: Which TICKS ME OFF.
<otakon> RyunosukeKnT: yes
<Sumica> 00,10Metal benders bend the impuritys in the metal
<Woodenfan> Metalbending can't use pure metals. So no gold mining
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
*Kimori nods
<Rainbow-Crash> Toph invented it in this series
<MahBoi777> wish there was one guy that yelled YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
<emangamer> otakon I still called it. there are very little things that are made of pure metal
<Fattonie> nope
<Phase4> rocks contain a lot of iron
<Kencolt> otakon: Did I sum him up properly?
<Kimori> I guess you were bored?
<RyunosukeKnT> basically Sumica
<Biglaw> Lol nope
<Dken2021> they may take our lives.....
<Suinide> I was
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I swear I'll be SO PISSED if it's raining outside :|
<Rainbow-Crash> she used the impurities to bend the metal, so it makes sense
<GabeMoist> THEY MAY TAKE OUR LIVES
<otakon> Kencolt: sum WHO up?
<GabeMoist> BUT THEY WILL NEVER TAKE
<CK|Ded> Because platinum is not a goddamn pure metal in most forms it appears in >_>
<SparklyWaffles> and zero fucks were given
<DoomrbringerZero> lol
<emangamer> otakon: so it's pratically the same thing
<GabeMoist> OUR FREEDOOOOOOOOM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hooray for inspiration speeches!

<RyunosukeKnT> to be fair, the best old man does it too
<CK|Ded> Saturn: In YOUR endo?
<FlareChaser> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3peldl/ Eyup, this pretty much sums ALLL of the questions to me.

<Kandarihu> The three core franchises of Super Robot Taisen are Gundam (U.C. timeline), Mazinger Z, and Getter Robo. If there were a western Super Robot Taisen, two of the core franchises has to be Megas and ExoSquad.
<Saturn> 08,01because he doesn't take into account quantum effects

<otakon> Caramel: like the Dragonball Z movies, and the Fullmetal Alchemist movies and the Ranma 1/2 movies
<Caramel> 2,14 otakon: if you saw Eureka Seven's finale, you'd understand
<Ponies47> YAY! :)
<Irish_Pony> O.>O?
<Caramel> 2,14 because, despite being a great ending, it ends on a cliffhanger
<Caramel> 2,14 so the fact they didn't finish it is >: (
<Petrified_Discord> mario_pony: What? Some of us aren't ponies (draconequus speaking :))

<CupcakeWarrior> I used to think I was the only one that hated CoD :D
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: WHY DO YOU SUPPORT BAD ANIME???

<mario_pony> dead
<mario_pony> :D
<Everlasting_Joy> I don't care for CoD games anymore, but that's just me.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: what bad anime? the fact that DBZ is STILL FUCKING AROUND says something. That fact that when most people think of anime, Goku pops up for them means something. It's not the best damn thing out there but dammit it's good enough to still be watched and enjoyed.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Tefacehuggah> YO YO YO YO YO YO!
<twilight_sprinkler> oooo dat wall rage
<Tefacehuggah> NOOOO!
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: let's see them still talk about Death Note and Code Geass in 20 years....

<hen3ry> no, DBZ still around only because still hasn't reached end of arc yet, what with fights taking 17 seasons
<Ninjazz> I know, Shane.
<Ponies47> Ok are someponies getting mad in here?
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: I hate how there are like 20 dbz games when they are the same thing but with slightly better graphics
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> IW needs to go die their cod games a broken to shit
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: thats all you dbz fans can say. but news flash: popularity=/= quality
<Petrified_Discord> Man, multitasking the chat and xbox is fukken hard when I'm playing 1 vs 4 :D
<Om> Death Note? No, Gode Geass. Maybe
<otakon> hen3ry: it's been over, ended with the Majin Buu saga
<Irish_Pony> about 8 more veiws and i break a record of most veiws in 1 day <3

<Ninjazz> Om: If you say Trixie one more damn time...
<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: have no fear, I always get good rest. I also don't have insomnia or sleep disorders, hehe. I'm perfectly healthy :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> and about dragonball
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: just, I'm done. I'm done trying to defend classic anime from you. You don't like. The point is if IT IS THE UTTER COW SHIT YOU DESCRIBE IT AS THERE WOULD BE NO INKLING OF IT NOWADAYS GODDAMMIT
<CrimsonPhoenix> the original is way better
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dragonball Z was yelling the anime
<CrimsonPhoenix> with hair power
<Caramel> 2,14 okay...calm down folks...
<Om> Ninjazz: I'll say it two more times if youd like :|
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: thats false logic

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands Ponies47 milk
<Caramel> 2,14 just watch the robots beat the shit out of each other
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: who?
<twilight_sprinkler> Caramel: im perfectly calm
<Irish_Pony> http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/art/Major-OC-Pony-303113797
<Malavolent> CrimsonPhoenix: Nice summary :
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: lol k
<Malavolent> :D
<Ninjazz> It's alright, otakon. I like dbz. One of first animes.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sylandest: I didn't take it as you have insomnia, I took it as a one night thing, but I hate those kind of nights.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thank you
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: YOU DON'T FUCKING LIKE IT, I GET IT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT UTTER SHIT SO STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT WHENEVER IT FUCKING COMES UP.
<Ponies47> Ninjazz: I gotta stop watching the Best Night Ever I've seen it at least 10 times :P
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: dude calm down, youre getting val mad
<CupcakeWarrior> http://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/204349135497871360
<Ninjazz> Ponies47: Or get some sleep.
<Irish_Pony> Caramel as long as i can get drunk ill be fine :P
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: why cant you talk calmly
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: yeah, I know. tired
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm not mad, just telling everyone to keep it cool
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> otakon: calm ur guam nam farm ya palm and ur neighy-palm
<Ninjazz> Om: No. Don't even say it once.
<otakon> brain is fuzzy atm
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow otakon
<GabeMoist> Val ain't even mad
<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: indeed, hehe. Fortunately, I'm always unconcious before long. I'll bore myself or trick myself into sleeping
<twilight_sprinkler> GabeMoist: and then live show
<Everlasting_Joy> Irish_Pony: Oh you :).
<Om> Ninjazz: I will refrain from saying Trixie anymore at times.
<Ponies47> I said I'm not tired! :[ Plus I'm a 14 year old clot why the buck would I need milk?
<twilight_sprinkler> see otakon im proving my point with logic
<Irish_Pony> Everlasting_Joy: wat??
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: trixie
<Ninjazz> Om: I'll believe that when I see it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Irish_Pony: "as long as I can get drunk."
*Ninjazz slaps Shane a gundam
<CupcakeWarrior> Ninjazz: Trixie
<Om> Ninjazz: I doubt even then.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane is immune
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: if you simply like the show, then say so, dont deny its quality if you cant prove it
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god perfect picture
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337749398060.jpg
<Irish_Pony> Everlasting_Joy well your name says it all :P
<Ninjazz> CupcakeWarrior: Et tu, Cupcake? D:
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane slaps Ninjazz with a foam hand saying trixie is stupid
<Ponies47> I think everypony is having to much fun trying to make me go to bed so.... I'm still not going to bed :P
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: what logic? the only logic is that popularity=/=good, however popularity does not carry something for 20 goddamn years. If DBZ was so cow shit bad as you think of it, it would have been forgotten by now.
<Everlasting_Joy> Irish_Pony: :D True.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: What's with that Trixie thing?
<Sumica> 00,10am I gonna have to start seprateing ponies?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: first otakon
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Oh nothing... I just hate her and all.
<Kandarihu> So, how far is this from the end now?
<Om> You could start with Ninjazz x Trixie
<twilight_sprinkler> im not even capsing
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Wow, why?
<Caramel> 2,14 Mama Sumica is putting her foot down ;)
<Irish_Pony> FALCON PAWNCH!
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Cause she's an arrogant bitch and people love her for it.
<Ponies47> YAY! Mama Sumica! :D
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: YOU do not like, you are a minority in that case. I grew up with it, it's fun to watch and entertaining. Hell, it's practically a soap opera with fists.
<Ninjazz> Om: Waaaaay toooooo late, my friend. She's already taken.
<Irish_Pony> Caramel: Dont let Mama Sumcia take me beer :'(
<Sumica> 00,10So help me I will turn this stream righ........hey wait . wth Caramel
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I don't exactly love her but I feel sorry for her.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: funniest moment once when Sumica was streaming me2
<Caramel> 2,14 <3
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: i can understand if you like it, but i cant agree that its good, which is what im proving
<Om> Ninjazz: Its not to late, its never to late.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: i said in chat wise and powerful Sumica and he happened to be talking on stream and he scoffed at wise
<Everlasting_Joy> There's the falcon pawnch!
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Aye. She lost everything. Sad. But that's why I hate her.
<CupcakeWarrior> Caramel: Why arent you attacking the actual boss?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: sumi sayd " pfft wise"
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ^ made my day
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: and the reason why its remembered is because it was a fad, a lot of people grew up on it together, hence its remembered
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon: http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337749398060.jpg
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Not why*
<twilight_sprinkler> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ninja'd
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's exactly how you look right now
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> twilight_sprinkler: wut?
<Caramel> 2,14 cupcakewarrior: because his shield is still up
<Everlasting_Joy> CupcakeWarrior: Picking off the little guys can be a great strategy.
<twilight_sprinkler> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nvm:P
<Caramel> 2,14 so attacking him is pointless when there's trash around him
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> 6_9 twilight_sprinkler
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Yeah, she learned her lesson. I'd still love to see her in the future, maybe a little wiser.
<CupcakeWarrior> So you have to kill everyone else first?
<Ninjazz> Om: Unfortunately for you, she really is taken. So, no.
<Sylandest> Caramel: remove shield by killing his army?
<Om> Lyra aint even scared
<twilight_sprinkler> eating nachos before bed is probably a bad idea
<Malavolent> LSD strike?
<Ponies47> Ok. The next pony who's says anything or does anything to make me go to bed I don't know what I'm gonna do. But I'll do somthing! :[
<Om> Ninjazz: In the end, does it really matter?
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: I'd personally like to NEVER see her again.
<Caramel> 2,14 it didn't specify how his shield goes down
<Irish_Pony> O.>O?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: u should try Techno kitten adventures
<Caramel> 2,14 so I can only hope it's by defeating his enemies
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: what do you want? the quality of the show and it's writing/characters is friggin subjective as hell. you can't GIVE ME A QUANTIFIABLE GOOD EQUATION. THerefore we are at a impasse. And saying it's a fad does not work as a arguement dammit, so leave it be. That's like saying MLP: FiM is a fad.
<twilight_sprinkler> anime lich king
<Ninjazz> Om: Well, you know. I had to fall to lose it all.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat long attack
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: stop.capsing.calm.down
<Kandarihu> Is this the final boss?
<CupcakeWarrior> Yep
<otakon> Kandarihu: on of them
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: cant we talk like civilized ponies?
<Irish_Pony> and only 10 damages will be done :P
<Malavolent> 10?
<Caramel> 2,14 okay, for the sake of the chat and my sanity, let's drop the anime subject then
<Malavolent> What the hell.
<Om> Ninjazz: Now your catching on. xD
<Sumica> 00,10lol watch the shield requires you to overload it with damage
<Kandarihu> So this IS the final mission?
<Caramel> 2,14 hey look! Giant robots! They're fighting things!
<Ponies47> We are so random! :P
<twilight_sprinkler> Caramel: ok, i cant get otakon to talk calmly, il lstop
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> sounds like robot wars
<Ninjazz> Om: Shush, you.
<Sylandest> Sumica: ahhh, I thought it might be that, but wasnt sure...I hate that strategy
<CupcakeWarrior> This game is intense
<Everlasting_Joy> Caramel: You realize this is based off an anime, may I suggest "what cat videos did you see on the 'net today?"
<Irish_Pony> Caramel: meh i got whiskey ill be fine....just keep rapping those robots
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> twilight_sprinkler: dont worry otakon is very opinonated
<Om> Ninjazz: That's what she said, as she faded away.
<Sumica> 00,10knee axe?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: just stop bringing it up. You insult one of my favorite things, 'kay? don't bring up DBZ whil you are here,that's all YOU have to do.
<Ponies47> 12:08 AM gonna hit the hay? Nope.avi
<twilight_sprinkler> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: yeah, hes emotional as hell too
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> twilight_sprinkler: dats our otakon for u
<Ninjazz> Om: Good. Do you honestly think I like her in any sense of the word? I hate her. Her fans. Her pics. Her fanon. Everything.
<GabeMoist> Everlasting_Joy, I saw videos of the most adorable cats today
<GabeMoist> I nearly died
<Malavolent> Those yellow robots have rainbow cutie marks. Awesome.
<Everlasting_Joy> GabeMoist: Show me please.
<Sumica> 00,10twilight_sprinkler, stop antagnoseing. otakon stop rageing
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait, can't not when something is streaming GabeMoist.
<Om> Ninjazz: Oh, you have looked for her pics then? What kind?
<GabeMoist> that's a double negative, so I can
<GabeMoist> so there
<mario_pony> Ninjazz: who's?
<twilight_sprinkler> Sumica: im not doing it on purpose, you know how easy it is to get him roiled up :P
<Everlasting_Joy> GabeMoist: I'll take your word for it. How cute was the kitty?
<Ninjazz> Om: The ones on EqD where Seth likes to cuddle with Trixie doll.
<Ninjazz> his*
<Irish_Pony> Overkill much????????
<GabeMoist> I nearly died
<CupcakeWarrior> Seth loves Trixie
<Ponies47> Sheesh finally everypony stopped trying to force me to go to bed. :)
<Sylandest> nicely done, Caramel!
<Om> Ninjazz: So who is your fav pony then.
<Malavolent> Badass look, check!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: do not talk about that sick buck
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkler: drop it now or I'm going to start kicking. I don't care which side, but if anyone continues this I'm going to have to act
<Ninjazz> Om: You're kidding me, right?
<twilight_sprinkler> Caramel: i already stopped
<twilight_sprinkler> Caramel: i stopped when i said i would
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: twilight_sprinkler stopped otakon still going
<Om> Ninjazz: Yes, that is why I asked.
*Ninjazz sighs
<Caramel> 2,14 and yet here you are *still* talking
<Caramel> 2,14 so stop
<Caramel> 2,14 and just watch the damn robots
<twilight_sprinkler> Caramel: stop...talking?
<GabeMoist> Caramel lies, he doesn't kick, he stabs with a trident
<GabeMoist> I have the scars to prove it
<Caramel> 2,14 stop arguing with a mod when they tell you to cut it out
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this site. :$
<Ninjazz> So... You could say that he is king of the sea ponies?
<Irish_Pony> ok im gonna try and calm the chat down....
<Om> Hoho
<Ninjazz> Aye, Everlasting_Joy. Ain't other one like it.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> twilight_sprinkler: its like telling a care bear to stop caring
<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: Aye, agreed! I enjoy every minute I'm in here

<Hex> What is the best thing to eat at 3 am.

<CupcakeWarrior> In my headcanon, the air DOES have a taste, but we got used to it in the womb so we forgot what it tastes like
*DeathStar dances
<Caramel> 2,14 except you don't breath air in the womb
<Rain> The air does have a flavor, and it is based on what is in the air
*MahBoi777 hugs DeathStar

<Caramel> 2,14 because we get several thousand people during pony episodes
<Caramel> 2,14 so we need to crowd control
<Rain> ^
<Caramel> 2,14 otherwise the chats are unreadable
<Rain> they split up the group :3

<DuskStarshimmer> Sea Lyra is best robot on acid steroids
<Midnight_Tempest> here is a good strategy to not make a streamer mad DuskStarshimmer... dont say anything about the stream other that 'What are we watching'... it tends to be the only good thing to say
<ravecrocker> its ok you are forgiven ^_^
<Mutterguy> i'm guessit.s count how many mechs you have. that's now your number of attacks :/
<CupcakeWarrior> More dakka!
<Ninjazz> A good proverb my older children shows taught me seems appropriate
<Midnight_Tempest> ravecrocker... dont talk bad about the stream, if you find it boring go somewhere else... and with that, i sleep
<Rain> who is forgiven for what, ravecrocker?
<PartyCannon> dat birthday

<SuperBrony64> 11,02You know, everyone is entitled to their own free opinion, but voicing hate about something that isn't constructive is both rude and uncalled for. At least on my own behalf, if you love a stream, it's great that you voice your enjoyment of it. It makes us happy and continue to enjoy streaming for you all. If you hate a stream, we can't force you to like it, but if you wish to voice
<Rain> 57k health
<SuperBrony64> 11,2it, go ahead and do it, but be constructive about it and say what can be done to make it better for you (preferably in PM). If nothing can be done about it and you're still unhappy, sorry, but just leave. We want you to stay, but if you're that unhappy, it's best to just leave and come back another time when something you like is being streamed.

<Ninjazz> DeathStar: ANOTHER GREAT GAME!
<Lambo> Airpuff: The thing is, the developers never cared to give hints how you could bucking reach those
<Phase4> weeeeeeee
<dshannon> -_-
<Airpuff> Lambo: ..after a LONG time..
<Monfang> There is a game that needs a remake
<Rain> lolololol
<Lambo> There was NO BUCKING CLUE
<Ninjazz> DeathStar: Argh. The nastolgia...
<PartyCannon> So SB, what do you use instead of the C buttons in this
<Ninjazz> lol

<Phase4> huh
<Ninjazz> And now the immersion is broken.
<Monfang> He lefft an area without completing it?
<GabeMoist> SuperBrony64, you need to aim for 100%
<Monfang> BLASPHAMY!
<Airpuff> Lambo: i know xD
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: jack and daxter ws basicaly the first game me my bo and sis all liked :)

<Lambo> N64 games had such a damn history with underwater levels...
<Phase4> dem textures
<Ninjazz> DeathStar: That game was one my favorites. Rachet and Clank was the first, but damn was Jak and Daxter close to being my favorite.
<Lambo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zek80k9UUTg
<GabeMoist> SuperBrony64, you forgot to feed the bird!
<Airpuff> Lambo: man dont remind me of when i was younger swimming on the damn waterlevels -.-
<Phase4> n64 had low res textures, hardware limits that were less than ideal
<MahBoi777> Lol Moo
<GabeMoist> Go back!
<Mutterguy> Mooooo
<TheRandomkid321> I guess I never traveled teh right path to get to underwatar levels on Starfox. there were ultiple planets i never got too.
<Airpuff> Lambo: i supermario 64.. i always died -.-
<Lambo> Airpuff: It was especially bad if you couldn'T see shit...
<Airpuff> Lambo: yeah xD
<Lambo> Always imagined the craziest shit
<Phase4> SuperBrony64, Moo

<Ninjazz> Monfang: It's SuperBrony64's thing
<TheRandomkid321> Mooooooooooo
<Lambo> MahBoi777: They took the wrong turn at some points
<Monfang> I thought Pinkie did 'HONK'
<Ninjazz> He had a video with cows in it and now Moo is his quote of the century
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: I never actualy played rachet and clank :( my parents never bought them
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I have all the systems :)
<Lambo> Imagine a FiM game in the style of these old jump 'n runs
<Ninjazz> We can probably blame almost all of bronystate for it getting so popular.
<Airpuff> DeathStar: omg.. your childhood...
<MahBoi777> I love Ratchet and Clank
<GabeMoist> SuperBrony64, FEED THE EAGLE
<Monfang> That'd be a good game, Lambo
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Monfang: its cause SuperBrony64 has a hidden love for cows
<TheRandomkid321> Lambo WOULD IT AHVE GUNS N BOOZE AND THEFT!?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheRandomkid321: scroll up
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: i'd reccomend her playing The legend of Zelda Ocarina of time, supermario 64 first though
<Lambo> Mario Party 1 was such a torture for my hand - especially my palm
