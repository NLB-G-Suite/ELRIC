<drf|laptop> 03and they keep guessing wrong,.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm guessing the answer's obvious?
<drf|laptop> 03to me it was, obviously not to the contestants

<drf|laptop> 03this is the keyboard though, not the trackpad
<lightlugia> 06Gnite all :3
<Lakorv> g'nite
<Shadow_Lugia> 6This keyboard is very annoying to me.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The a-button is broken, and the n-key and spacebar sometimes doesn't work.
<drf|laptop> 03is it a desktop?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Broken not as in not functioning, just it wiggles off every now and the.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6then*
<Shadow_Lugia> 6No, it's my parents' laptop.
<drf|laptop> 03oh

<drf|laptop> 03I'm used to things like Millionaire
<Armads> well if they fail at life as much as they were a few minutes ago
<Armads> 5k would be a lot
<drf|laptop> 03true
<Lakorv> extacy is the old spelling
<Lakorv> I don't know the new one
<Lakorv> because I just use the deprecated one.

<Ray> 02LOL Hiya Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Why such high leveled monsters solo? XD
<Ray> 02Becuase I'm insane, lol
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 9Petilil.
<Hawkie> 07Pff
<Hawkie> 07Lol
<SilverSonic> ohai
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ this movie
<Hawkie> 07Dont mind me
<Hawkie> 07I'm just chewing on my water bottle
<drf|laptop> 03"Who let the cat out?" "We don't have a cat!" "...oh, Get out of here!"
*Lakorv pokes Articuno.
<drf|laptop> 03http://shirt.thatdailydeal.com/
<drf|laptop> 03that's awesokme
<drf|laptop> 03-k
<NightSeas> 12drf, did you hear about how Virgin Mobile is going to be offering Motorola phones now?
<drf|laptop> 03no, but I ha,ve Verizon
<drf|laptop> 03*have
<Lakorv> I find it funny how the American carriers lock phones to themselves
<Lakorv> over here, you can get any phone on any network, with any plan o.O
<drf|laptop> 03it's because American companies are evil
<drf|laptop> 03and people will pay for it
<NightSeas> 12I know xD but Virgin Mobile used to never offer phones like that
<drf|laptop> 03that being said you can still buy unlocked phones
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I just encountered a very stereotypical example of an uneducated person when it comes to pixel fan art.
<Hawkie> 07k
<Hawkie> 07showertiems
*Hawkie afkhawk
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay to you.
<NightSeas> 12lol, no offence intended, but most people draw awful pixel art
<drf|laptop> 03that's because pixel art is just pixel art
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Shush, DRF.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Do you want me to make correlations?
<NightSeas> 12Well, I like pixel art, but some people really don't know what they are doing
<Lakorv> pixel art can be amazing
<NightSeas> 12It takes true skill to draw pixel art
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And patience. X>
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You must tell the story of this uneducated person, I'm really curious
<NightSeas> 12Well, it takes patience to draw anything good
<Shadow_Lugia> 6For piece of pixel art 100 x 100 requires clicking 10,000 times.
*Shiny-Growlithe sits down with pizza
<drf|laptop> 03or you can just draw a normal picture and downscale it to 100x100
<NightSeas> 12That would not look right
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That would not be pixel art, DRF. But I digress.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And Shiny; lambasting me about how my supposed unoriginality is plagiarism.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lmao
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Which I refuted with what art counts as fair use.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02On one of your arts?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02On dA?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6On the sprite I'm working on now.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6On MS Paint. :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So how did they see it? .-.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6It's on this laptop and I'm working on it. :U
<Shadow_Lugia> 6In real life.
<NightSeas> 12However, patience is what separates good fan art from bad fan art.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ahh I see
<NightSeas> -space
<Shadow_Lugia> 6ovO?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That space.
<NightSeas> 12Yep XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Anyway, my sprite is a fake Grass/Dragon dinosaur fakemon. Inspired by a person's comment on dA and (I think) AE's comment here.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm. Its head looks like a banana.
*Shadow_Lugia 6edits.
<Ray> 02YESZ
<Ray> 02Finally
<Ray> 02A long battle
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Donde?
<Ray> 02With only 5 min remaning
<Feather> 10pop
<Shadow_Lugia> 6ovo
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out on Feather
<Feather> 10<3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You need to draw more art so that I may be jealous
<Feather> 10I've had an art block
<Feather> 10but I think I'm getting past it
<SilverSonic> ohai Feather
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Awesome
<Feather> 10I actually could draw something yesterday
<Feather> 10XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because I'm starting to go into one lmao
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Feather?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Draw Suiguno. >v>
*Shadow_Lugia 6flies
<Feather> 10wanna do an art trade o-o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lmao
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh, what the heck. :P
<Feather> 10Coooool
<Shadow_Lugia> 6As long as my sprite isn't as detailed as Suiguno IV. Ovo
<Feather> 10XD
<Feather> 10wasn't expecting you to
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, how good my sprites are fluctuates.
*Shiny-Growlithe curls up on Feather's head
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I've recently drawn a Zorua and Hydreigon I'm pleased with.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But it's on notebook paper.
<Feather> 10Hydreigon :D
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Anyway, the art trade:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Whaddya want?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm?
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Ou
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, nvm
*Feather thinks
*Shiny-Growlithe yawns
*Shadow_Lugia 6floofs.
*Shadow_Lugia 6anticipates Nick.
*Shiny-Growlithe slobbers on Feather's head
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ Judge Judy
<drf|laptop> 03this girl is crying over a guy owing her $70
<Feather> 10...LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, small claims court... but SMALL claims court? XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The guy owes her? O_o
<drf|laptop> 03that's why they're in court
<drf|laptop> 03she's suing him for a payment on a computer
<drf|laptop> 03but the payment was only $70 LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> You could find that on a streetside :p
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What streetside?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I want to find this streetside
<drf|laptop> 03a rich one?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02These people obviously aren't rich if they're going to court over $70
<drf|laptop> 03I know right
<drf|laptop> 03who needs a loan to buy a laptop
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, like, actual adults
<drf|laptop> 03not kids
<Shadow_Lugia> 6LAG.
<Kyu> 07ohgawdRebeccaBlackhasanothermusicvideolol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Old.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wanna see
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, late by almost a day.

<Kyu> 07at least it isn't horribly autotuned lol
<Feather> 10oh joy
<Shadow_Lugia> 6It's actually decent.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Note the like/dislike ratio.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Judge Judy
<drf|laptop> 03these guys are admitting to smoking pot
<drf|laptop> 03on the show
<drf|laptop> 03If I was a judge
<drf|laptop> 03and someone admitted to breaking a law
<drf|laptop> 03I'd be like GTFo, both of you
<Hawkie> 07Alright
<Kyu> 07lol
<Hawkie> 07I'm off for foods
<Kyu> 07but she isn't a judge
<drf|laptop> 03How is Judge Judy not a judge
<Kyu> 07she was
<drf|laptop> 03was?
<Kyu> 07but nothing on the show is legally binding
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03really?
<Kyu> 07yup
<Kyu> 07when someone on there sues someone else
<drf|laptop> 03then why do they say "real cases, real people, the decisions are final" etc
<Kyu> 07both sides make money
<Kyu> 07lol
<Kyu> 07it's arbitration
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't know that XD
<drf|laptop> 03either way
<drf|laptop> 03she dismisses cases all the time, if someone comes in there and talks about being a drug addict, I'd dismiss it right then and there
<Kyu> 07whoever loses just gets less money than the other XD
<drf|laptop> 03where's the money come from o.o
<Kyu> 07the tv studio lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Makes sense why people who lost still smile even when they get out of court
<drf|laptop> 03people get paid to be on the show?
<Kyu> 07yup
<drf|laptop> 03dude, someone sue me please
*drf|laptop runs
<Kyu> 07it's in the credits XD
<drf|laptop> 03hm, I'll pay close attention then
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Feather? That art trade?
<Feather> 10Sorry, I'm trying to think of something XD
<Feather> 10got a lot going on at once
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay.
*Shiny-Growlithe draws on Feather's head
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I have 30 minutes.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My masterpiece
*NightSeas draws on Feather's head as well
<Feather> 10Ohhh I know what I want
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Get your own head >|
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh?
<Feather> 10Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
<Shadow_Lugia> 6ovO
<Shadow_Lugia> 6As a sprite?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So was my precognizance correct?
<Espeon> 06<%Feather> Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
<Espeon> 06Yes.
<Feather> 10http://quanyails.deviantart.com/art/GENTLEMEN-195919939 <-- I like the style you used in this picture, but if a sprite would be easier then I'm okay with that :>
<Espeon> 06It make sense. If Ness is the one with the bat.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6D:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6WHY SHOW THAT? DDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
<Feather> 10THAT PIC IS AWESOME D:
<Espeon> 06Surprise
<Feather> 10you totally made me picture spy blonde lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Is not. :<
<Shadow_Lugia> 6My mental perception's changed due to Liquidsilk's idea.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But anyway, drawing cartoonishly...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I guess I could... X.x
<Feather> 10more than half my gallery I can't even look at anymore lol
<Feather> 10so I know how you feel
<Feather> 10but really
<Feather> 10I love that picture D:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So you want Ness as relatively normal?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Not like SSBB?
<Feather> 10YES, I hate SSBB's style XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So, wait:
*Shadow_Lugia 6checks Ness's design.
*NightSeas stalks
<Shadow_Lugia> 6How would you tell that was Ness?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6He's not very distinctive. :P
<drf|laptop> 03Wow, I didn't realize that Timmy's dad is voiced by the guy who plays Gordy in Ned's Declassified
<drf|laptop> 03but that's interesting
<drf|laptop> 03and makes sense
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Doesn't he also voice Cosmo?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not sure
<drf|laptop> 03does he?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm watching that live action movie, it's on Nick right now
<Feather> 10It can be Ness with his normal hat colors, but wearing it the way Scout does, his original backpack, and a black and blue striped shirt (that'll represent team blu). Then he'll just have Scout's original pants, socks, shoes, bandages, dogtag, and earpiece. :D
*Shadow_Lugia 6notes that.
<Feather> 10oh, and if you wanted to add a bat, Ness's original wooden bat
*Shadow_Lugia 6sends Quanyails a note.
<Feather> 10XD
<Espeon> 06>Normal Hat
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oookay.
<Espeon> 06>TF2
<Espeon> 06what are you smoking
*Espeon dies
<Feather> 10wut?
<Feather> 10XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm not sure if I can live up to your expectations.
<Espeon> 06x3
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You noticed on the deviation how long it took to draw that with MS Paint?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Now, drawing an entire figure...
<Feather> 10Oh, you don't HAVE to draw his whole body
<Feather> 10was just noting incase you did
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'll see what I can do.
<Feather> 10I definitely don't want to ask too much from you
<Feather> 10ah, darn... just realized his hat contains red
*Shadow_Lugia 6will abuse her Ticonderoga pencil and archaic, loose notebook to the best she can.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Scout's hat?
<Feather> 10Guess I can just go with that
<Shadow_Lugia> 6All right.
<Feather> 10and you want Suiguno?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hrm.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, can you draw old-ish people?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Or two people? :P
<Feather> 10when I do it always ends up cute and young looking lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Or one person and GLaDOS?
<Feather> 10I can do two people
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6This idea came up in my mind because of voice actors:
<drf|laptop> 03why the frick are they making a Glee 3D movie >_>
<Lakorv> obscure Japanese characters ftw?
<HyperMetalLugia> Glee 3D O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<SilverSonic> o_O
<HyperMetalLugia> They better have Safety Dance in 3d >:(
<SilverSonic> EW GLEE
<HyperMetalLugia> *shot*
<HyperMetalLugia> Glee is decent :p
<SilverSonic> no its not.
<HyperMetalLugia> Stop hatin'
<SilverSonic> its god awful
<HyperMetalLugia> ;)
<SilverSonic> Nou
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, at least they can sing
<SilverSonic> yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Better than you :p
<SilverSonic> but they cover some of the worst songs ;p
<SilverSonic> other than journey's song ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't know that song :p
<HyperMetalLugia> So it must be a bad song
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But either the Sniper and the Administrator or Sniper and GLaDOS. :P
<SilverSonic> well, their covers are terrible
<HyperMetalLugia> Sniper with portal gun and GLaDOS
<HyperMetalLugia> Then you profit :po
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Not exactly, HML. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Not a crossover yet :<
<Feather> 10what does GLaDOS look like exactly?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Feather doesn't know
<HyperMetalLugia> How
<Feather> 10I don't play portal lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://faceplantreview.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/portal2-glados2.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> So, she is a super star (villian)
*Shiny-Growlithe prods Feather
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:>
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Not a human, exactly...
<Feather> 10I could do GLaDOS if I had enough refs XD
<Ray> 02Yush, HR 28
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Google. :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But try not to make the Sniper look too bishie. ovo
<Feather> 10probably a noob to ask but
<Feather> 10wats bishie
*Shadow_Lugia 6brings up TV Tropes.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02While you're at it draw Claus
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I dunno, draw them together, doing something together. X3
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Then again, with GLaDOS...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6If you can draw the Administrator, do so. :P
<Sakuya> Feathet draw glados, end of story just do it
<Sakuya> I mean what

<drf|laptop> 03There are 3 people who all claimed to have been there
<Glacymr> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03and they all have different stories
<Espeon> 06CLASSIC "WHO IS LYING" TASK GO
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I would have laughed if all 3 people said they killed her
<drf|laptop> 03it's like "GOOD LUCK ARRESTING ANY OF US"
<drf|laptop> 03but I haven't heard the stories yet
<drf|laptop> 03still watching
<Espeon> 06more like "lol ok arresting all of you until further investigation"
<Espeon> 06or well, keep them in custody or whatever it's called
<drf|laptop> 03still, they couldn't definitively charge one person if all 3 claim to have done it
<drf|laptop> 03since this was back in the 80s
<drf|laptop> 03they didn't have hte fancy DNA stuff XD
<Espeon> 06xD
<Espeon> 06fair enough
<drf|laptop> 03well, could abeen early 90s
<Espeon> 06but still, no magic DNA shenanigans
<drf|laptop> 03I think the show went from like 1982 to early 2000s, but this is clearly an older episode given the quality of it
<drf|laptop> 03yeah this is obviusly before GPS
<drf|laptop> 03as two of the 3 witnesses were cops
<drf|laptop> 03and they had no way of veri3fying if they were really there
<drf|laptop> 03all cop cars now have trackable GPS LOL
<NightSeas> 12!cmds

<NightSeas> 12lol fake witnesses
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I know right
<drf|laptop> 03why would cops lie about it

<Glacymr> 12lol Espeon
<Espeon> 06Or well, that was the one for 1000 views because it gives a HAT
<Glacymr> 12i'm just doing auto refresh
<drf|laptop> 03LL was telling me how dumb it was

<Feather> 10?
<Quanyails> 7In that two hours -10 minutes, I've sketched two doodles for that art trade.
<Feather> 10:D
<Quanyails> 7I think I made Ness look older than he's supposed to be. o3o
<Glacymr> 12Feather~~~~
<Quanyails> 7But I think that's because of his minute proportions normally.
<Feather> 10That's fine, I'd rather him look older than younger XD
<Quanyails> 7Okay, well, let me scan the two sketches in.
<Quanyails> 7Then you can decide if you want which to digitalize.
<Quanyails> 7So are you drawing the Sniper/Administrator/GLaDOS or Suiguno?
<Feather> 10whichever you'd prefer
<Aurora> GLaDOS
<Aurora> DO IT

<Creideiki> Hello
<Glacymr> 12hi

<Glacymr> 12lol Creideiki
<Glacymr> 12we both suck :D
<Glacymr> 12yay
<NightSeas> 12I suck at TF383723928
<Glacymr> 12i don't think that's out yet
<Feather|AFK> 10I suck too
<Feather|AFK> 10but
<Feather|AFK> 10it's still fun
<Feather|AFK> 10<3
<Creideiki> Yeah, that's a few aeons of Valve time away from occuring. :P
<Glacymr> 12really Feather
<NightSeas> 12No it's not :<
<Glacymr> 12the only thing that seems fun to do is prop hunt
<Creideiki> I know right, TF2 is hilarious.
<Creideiki> (Also, half the random set garnishments I know know what they're pretending to be and mildly confuse my retrocomputing nerd. :P )
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Crei, you play, too?
<Creideiki> Quanyails: Just got it after I realized "Wait... it's FREE!?"
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Quanyails> 7Well, I was going to ask if you'd like to join us for a community game this Saturday/Sunday.
<Quanyails> 7But I have dinner.
<Creideiki> Ah.
<Creideiki> What time would said community game be?
<NightSeas> 12[18:01] <Creideiki> Quanyails: Just got it after I realized "Wait... it's FREE!?" <-- No, it's not. I'm going to start charging everyone $49.99 plus tax for it :D
<Creideiki> LOL
<NightSeas> 12And I'm going to start making people pay for steam as well
<Quanyails> 7 7/22/11 9:00 PM to Midnight PDT, Crei.
<NightSeas> 12How much money was TF2 when it costed money?
<Quanyails> 7Whoops, that's one of my timmes.
<Quanyails> 7-m
<Quanyails> 7I have this list.
<Quanyails> 7http://mibpaste.com/GwjryR
<Creideiki> Darn, I don't use my PC past midnight Eastern.

<Quanyails> 7D:
<Quanyails> 7Hey, I am.
<drf|laptop> 03Someone told me to bring my laptop to class, so I did
<Quanyails> 7Please make an effort that night? :<
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<prince_dari> That's how you do the why wub woo face on IRC properly Lambda. :P
<Creideiki> Quanyails: It's not that I don't want to, it's more of The Nazi Doom Parents.
<Quanyails> 7o_o
<Quanyails> 7No persuasion?
<Quanyails> 7Rather, don't invoke Godwin's Law.
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.speedtest.net/result/1393151463.png <- LOL crappy community colleges
<Creideiki> Quanyails: When I say they're Nazis... I really quite mean it. (Since they're more technically grandparents, but nevermind.) Both grew with in Nazi Germany... and me grandmum asserts that the world would be better with Hitler again. (Yes, she's that nuts.)
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Quanyails> 7o__O
<drf|laptop> 03LOL.
<drf|laptop> 03also, what's Godwin's law
<Glacymr> 12drf
<Glacymr> 12that is fast
<drf|laptop> 03that's horrible for a school
<drf|laptop> 03my university had like 60mbps
<Quanyails> 7The idea that anyone who uses Hitler or the Nazis in an argument automatically loses the argument.
<drf|laptop> 03orly?
<Quanyails> 7Well, draws comparisons to.
<drf|laptop> 03wha[t about the expression 'grammar nazi'
<drf|laptop> 03or my personal favorite, "copyright nazis"
<Lambda> ah
<drf|laptop> 03because that's more or less what the MAFIAA is
<Lambda> thanks
<Lambda> :P
<Quanyails> 7Well, that'd put your commentary to no persuasion. :P
<Creideiki> There is one instance in which Godwin's Law does not hold. Namely, when actually discussing Hitler and the Nazis. :P
<Quanyails> 7Actually, the statement above is one of Godwin's Law's corollaries (I just checked).
<Quanyails> 7I have a feeling this is going on our chat stats vocabulary list. D:
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03what's wrong with that?
<Quanyails> 7Anyway...
<Quanyails> 7Why don't your parents allow you this? :{
<Quanyails> 7"P*
<Quanyails> 7Blah.
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm not focused today.
<Quanyails> 7Too many typos. o.O
<Glacymr> 12is steam down or something?
<Glacymr> 12nevermind
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Creideiki> The reason my parents do not allow me on the PC past 00:00 is: ...?
<drf|laptop> 03Steam is basically always down as far as I'm concerned :P
<drf|laptop> 03as it always takes me like 27 attempts to sign in
<Quanyails> 7Yep, Crei.
<Quanyails> 7Huh.

<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of that
<Glacymr> 12it was never intended for people to drill into teeth and fill it with something
<drf|laptop> 03I was eating some cookies and apparently the spot in the crorner of my mouth where I got a filling started hurting again xlx
<drf|laptop> 03*x.x
<Feather> 10one on the left is <3, but if the other one would be easier go for it. I'll be happy with either. :D

*drf|laptop grabs the cannon
<Elky> or did he sneeze?
<DrDoom> move front
<Razyn> Napoleon's not a snatcher. He's just some figment of a tall man's imag- Oh /that/ Napoleon.
<Elky> all napoleons ever were snatchers
<PizzaPony> France's last testicle died with Napoleon. And he only had the one.

<NewDCD> 9it wouldn't fire
<Elky> not at all
<NewDCD> 9but eh
<Razyn> Didn't you say you intentionally missed one on training so it wouldn't go into impossible difficulty?
<NewDCD> 9doesn't matter now
<Elky> at least you survived
<DrDoom> what's impossible difficulty?
<NewDCD> 9accidentally hit a civilian
<drf|laptop> 03it's a flash game.

<DesSur> O SHI SNATCHER
<NewDCD> 9that makes it "hard, but not impossible"
<drf|laptop> 03I just like referring to it XD
<Dashite> JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING GILLIAN!
<DrDoom> but how hard is impossible?
<Dashite> Wait, they hate ultraviolet rays?
<DesSur> Can't ever complete, give up impossible.
<NewDCD> 9Rubber Band AI: Doing well in the practice gun shooting sections makes the in-game sequences almost impossible. It is recommended to do intentionally poorly to keep the difficulty down. And even then, if you're running the game on an emulator (and, let's face it, in this day and age, you probably are), you'll either have to be a keyboard magician or, if you'r
<HyperMetalLugia> I bloody game :<
<HyperMetalLugia> *A
<drf|laptop> 03I've seen far worse

<DesSur> No.
<DrDoom> so that makes you a half-wizard
<DesSur> Everything kills /b/.

<PizzaPony> all of a sudden I want to pull out my ps1 and play MGS straight through
<Aponymous> AVENGE HARRY AND RANDOM!
<NewDCD> 9>Implying the voice acting isn't GLORIOUS
<Elky> why does gillian sometimes have blue and sometimes brown eyes?
<Elky> weird
<NewDCD> 9Elky: because palette limitations of the Era
<DesSur> Hey, let's go use the SHooting Range!
<Bradley> thank u
<DesSur> Practice our skills before the big game.
<Bradley> ^_^
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Or possibly building up to a Snatcher-related twist
<Ghosties> 4@PizzaPony: I still have my copy of MGS for the PS1
<Elky> I was wondering if he was a snatcher...
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/6271771/images/1255557317139.png
<_Dermathil> GHOSTIES
<DesSur> WAIT I WASNT SERIOUS
<PizzaPony> @Ghosties: Wait, you mean it's possible to NOT still have it?
<Ghosties> 4What, Dermathil?
<Razyn> I always thought MGS was an FPS so I never touched the series
<Ghosties> 4@PizzaPony: Yes, it's possible. I know, it seems unfathomable
<PizzaPony> MGS is a stealth-espionage game
<PizzaPony> 3rd person, with the ability to do 1st person scoping
<_Dermathil> ohai
<desertman2> Not the first one
<DesSur> Take the poster.
<Ghosties> 4Hah, hi Dermathil
<PizzaPony> true, the 1st person wasnt in #1 except for the psg1 and stinger, unless you count the twin snakes
<_Dermathil> Did you change color Ghosties?
<DrDoom> what i miss
<Ghosties> 4Twin Snakes was good, but not nearly as great as the original MSG
<_Dermathil> I don't remember you being so... red
<DrDoom> did you kill the chief
<DrDoom> and yeah i hate twin snakes
<DrDoom> snake goes all neo
<Dashite> It's possible to have never played MGS let alone not own it.
<Ghosties> 4And no, I didn't change color, Dermathil XD
<Razyn> psg1 stinger and twin snakes? ...Weapons?
<PizzaPony> there is just something about snakes polygon head in mgs
<_Dermathil> ah
<Elky> huh...
<Ghosties> 4Bah, MSG
<DrDoom> and he shouldn't be there
<Ghosties> 4MGS
<Elky> so he's nowhere?
<PizzaPony> PSG1 and Stinger are weaons, Twin Snakes is a remake for the gamecube of MGS
<NewDCD> 9Mobile Suit Gundam?
<PizzaPony> metal gear solid
<DesSur> OH FUCK BLOOD
<_Dermathil> BLOOOOOD
<Ghosties> 4Twin Snakes was a much more action oriented version of MGS; much flashier, too
<Aponymous> THE ROOOOOOF
<Cynder7> 6How are you? :P
<Elky> oshit
<Razyn> Should I just go tackle the first one?
<PizzaPony> WAT
<DesSur> O SHI
<Razyn> The fuck?
<_Dermathil> OH SNAP
<HaveTubaWillTravel> SPIDERMAN IS A SNATCHER
<Ghosties> 4The fuck was Kano doing up there...?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> IN EVERY CONTINUITY OF HIS SERIES
<Dashite> No one ever looks on the roof!
<_Dermathil> Ghosties: he's a terminator crossover in Blade Runner
<_Dermathil> See? We play as Harrison Ford!
<Dashite> Find blood. Red stains on red background!
<Elky> dat blood
<prince-dari> Wigglesworth is a snatcher.
<PizzaPony> Use the UV light! Find out that other people hit on other people too... much more successfully
<Ghosties> 4@Dermathil: Well, Boon did say that Kano's eye was directly influenced by the Terminator in a scene from T2
<Elky> wasn't there blood under the chair in the detective's room?
<Bradley> good
<_Dermathil> hehehe
<Bradley> yourself?
<Elky> or at least I saw some there
<Ghosties> 4Confession time!
<PizzaPony> Has anyone seen DSNesmith
<_Dermathil> The devs of this said they blatantly ripped off Terminator and Blade Runner when they made this
<Dashite> I love confession time!
<Ghosties> 4I have no idea what is going on in this game.
<DesSur> Inspiration, Dermathil. Inspiration.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Confession? Ghosties is gonna confess to being a snatcher?
<Elky> there!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> THAT'S WHAT A SNATCHER WOULD SAY
<DesSur> Ghosties is a SNATCHER.
<Cynder7> 6I'm fine thx ^^
*PizzaPony thinks Ghosties is the cutest snatcher.
<_Dermathil> DesSur: they said explicitly they ripped em off
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Agreed, PizzaPony
<Ghosties> 4...dear lord, this chat
<Aponymous> I CALLED IT!
<DesSur> _Dermathil: ...and a good one too.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> You wouldn't believe how much chat gold you missed
<PizzaPony> oh Ghosties, you know you love us.
<Razyn> Ghosties is tsundere snatcher
<Ghosties> 4It's bad enough to think I'm a SNATCHER, ...but "cutest snatcher?"
*Dashite orders a pizza to Ghosties address
<_Dermathil> DesSur: I never said otherwise
<Elky> we need snatcher pony fanart now.
<DrDoom> lol why so red.
<PizzaPony> He got his 'Story Mark' as a pair of gloves and handcuffs
<Elky> fund it!
<DesSur> _Dermathil: Didn't we just talk about it before?
*PizzaPony reads pizza order.
<DrDoom> Talk about crappy lighting.
<Ghosties> 4I'm totally tsundere for this chatroom
<DesSur> O SHI-

<HaveTubaWillTravel> PizzaPony: Oh how I love the YTP I tihnk you're referencing

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I like Feather :<
<DrDoom> where did he get those charges from
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She's popular because she isn't here often
<prince-dari> FLY YOU FOALS
<NewDCD> 9I told you dogs
<Feather> 10lulz
<NewDCD> 9shooting Elijah would be a BAD idea
<Lucas> lolz
<Elky> OH SNAP
<Arcanine> 12Feather apparently likes me as an arcanine
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I like how Gillian and Jamie are just standing stock-still, straight up
<DesSur> Damn it.
<DesSur> Should have shot those fuckers.
<Arcanine> 12probably because it's such a rare sight as well
<_Dermathil> SHOOT MORE

<_Dermathil> RANDOM
<Lucas> LOL Feather isnt glomping me even as lucas, *is relived*
<desertman2> Who said that?
<DesSur> RANDOM!
<DrDoom> Random pulled a wolverine
<DesSur> YES
*Lucas hides
<Hipster_Brony> 8Suddenly, alive!
<DrDoom> GONNA DIE BUB
<PizzaPony> oh that scene
*Shiny-Growlithe is better as Growlithe :<
<NightSeas> 12drf, then turn your phone around and use the touch screen
<Elky> Random's a total Sue.
<DrDoom> Dat mutant regenerating factor
<_Dermathil> eeyup, Elky
<Razyn> Epic recovery. Just break glass.
<Hipster_Brony> 8YOU'RE GONNA DIE, CLOWN!
<Aponymous> Explosions aren't manly enough to kill RANDOM HAJILE!
<DrDoom> WPN X
<NightSeas> 12Wait, nevermind
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<DrDoom> Pfft.
<drf|laptop> 03this is a computer derp
<Elky> You know it to be true.
*Arcanine is more floofy than a growlithe
<DrDoom> Explosions are not random enough to kill hajile
<Elky> not that it's bad
<NewDCD> 9>Implying you don't love Random
*Shiny-Growlithe is more cute and still has floof
<PizzaPony> lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:P
<DrDoom> Also, sues aren't necessarily bad.
<Elky> he's more like a storytelling device than a person
<DrDoom> HE's the ace.
<DrDoom> not a sue
<Elky> but that's okay
<Arcanine> 12more cute yes
<Arcanine> 12more floof no ^^
<PizzaPony> Elky, he ISN'T a person
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I thought I just said that
<DrDoom> he's a snatcher!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I still have floof, but not as much
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But I'm cuter
*NightSeas floofs Arcanine
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yeah. Modnar just said machines have no will
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Puppies are cuter
<NewDCD> 9MOST RECREATIONAL
<Arcanine> 12eep
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Doesn't mean Random's not awesome, though
<Elky> well, he's a character
*Arcanine is floofed
<Elky> and characters can be Sues.
<Razyn> inb4 cutscene lasts long enough to allow realtime 3 min countdown.
*Lucas huggles all floof
<Arcanine> 12lol

<Elky> they're all dead, aren't they? even napoleon?
<PizzaPony> inb4 shoelaces tied

*Light_Latias 12huggles Shiny
<DesSur> And so, there goes the greatest game for the SEGA CD. ;~;
<DrDoom> what was the super secret plot twist
<NewDCD> 9how did you like them apples?
<Hipster_Brony> 8metal gear is a snatcher
<Light_Latias> 12I can relate :<
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://cdn2.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/075/873/original/Raisins_Face.jpg
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Her hair looks like it's having a seizure... but that's a VERY pretty sunset
<DesSur> GREATEST GAME FOR SEGA CD EVER.
<Ghosties> 4I have an idea for another live LP
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I like them apples as much as Applejack likes hers.
<PizzaPony> DAT VOICE OVER
<Ghosties> 4If the mods will here it
<HaveTubaWillTravel> i.e. a lot
<Elky> this game was pretty awesome
*_Dermathil activates the thrusters on his rocket lawnchair. CYALL, GOTTA GET SOME SLEEP ON DA MOON!!!!!

<HaveTubaWillTravel> Talk about a Missed Moment of Awesome
<PizzaPony> byebye derma
<Elky> DCD: why not?
<DrDoom> >MFW NO BABY UNICORN PONY
<Aponymous> This game is great, it'd be perfect with a baby unicorn though.
<DrDoom> baby unicorn PONY
<Elky> would probably be good too
<Nittany_Tiger> Hyperbola time (if I can concentrate).
<DrDoom> otherwise it'd just be really really really good
<NewDCD> 9this was spotted during E3 this year. People have chalked it up to the "Sdatcher", but I doubt it will be just that...after all, look at the poster http://gonintendo.com/wp-content/photos/snat2.jpg
<NewDCD> 9now enjoy the great music
<NewDCD> 9so how did you like DAT GAME?

<drf|laptop> 03but listen to how horrid that quality is
<drf|laptop> 03it has TWO rap verses instead of one
<drf|laptop> 03granted, the no rap version is the best
<drf|laptop> 03but I want to make a longish edit with all the words XD
<Lucas> No rap is good at all ;pp
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 11Croconaw.
<Arcanine> 12to drf
<nickstr> so true
<Arcanine> 12a song has to be FLAC or higher
<Feather> 10Eminem is good
<Lucas> ^
<Lucas> hes fine
<nickstr> <Lucas> No rap is good at all <-- this is what I meant
<drf|laptop> 03not to mention
<nickstr> I hate rap
<drf|laptop> 03this song isn't a rap song at all
<nickstr> can't stand it in the least
<drf|laptop> 03it's a remake of a classic rock song
<drf|laptop> 03it just has a rap verse
<drf|laptop> 03and heck
<drf|laptop> 03a lot of 80s dance songs have rap verses
<drf|laptop> 03it makes them good XD
<drf|laptop> 03like Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now), etc
<Lucas> Black and White had a rap verse? or something
<nickstr> EWW RAP
<drf|laptop> 03I love how iTunes' website froze my web browser
<drf|laptop> 03thayt sounds about right
<drf|laptop> 03*that
<nickstr> crap is more like it

<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9http://forums.selectbutton.net/viewtopic.php?t=3826
<nickstr> which is why top 40 sucks these days
<NewDCD> 9I'll just leave this here
<nickstr> it was better in the late 1990s
<drf|laptop> 03but like I said
<drf|laptop> 03a lot of those songs had rap verses
<drf|laptop> 03rap verses in songs != rap songs
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<drf|laptop> 03I hate impossible to find songs x.x
<prince-dari> If you hate them, why are you looking for them? Trololo.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I mean I hate the fact that they're impossible to find.
<drf|laptop> 03that being said I enjoy a challenge, I've found about four "non existant" songs now
<Arcanine> 12XD
<Arcanine> 12I.O.N is impossible to find
<Arcanine> 12i know what he means
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there was one song
<drf|laptop> 03that my friend heard on the radio back in like 1995
<drf|laptop> 03but only radio stations had it
<drf|laptop> 03and there was no record at all that it even existed
<drf|laptop> 03we finally found it on a UK single I imported, using ebay LOL
<drf|laptop> 03they called it the "Alternate radio edit"
<drf|laptop> 03as the "radio edit" was still the original
<drf|laptop> 03and that song is actally good, it's by Blessid Union of Souls, the people who did that song Brother my Brother for the first Pokémon movie
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Uploaded
<prince-dari> Lol.
<drf|laptop> 03the normal one has a n-word in it, the radio edit doesn't, but that one never really surfaced anywhere
<Arcanine> 12sigh
<Arcanine> 12i want to get used to keyboard and mouse for TF2
<Arcanine> 12instead of 360 controller but it just feels so bizaree
<Arcanine> 12*bizarre
<drf|laptop> 03I hate using keyboard and mouse for games
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I play on the xbox
<Arcanine> 12you do know TF2 can be adjusted to use a controller right?
<Lucas> except drf hates TF2
<HyperMetalLugia> I use a wireless PS2- ripoff controller XD
<HyperMetalLugia> It's the best thing
<Arcanine> 12i use a 360 controller by default
<Arcanine> 12but it gets reallly awkward to control the engineer and spy then
<Ray> 02LOL what drf doesn't hate? ... Trains?
<prince-dari> Hmm, I think keyboard and mouse are nice to play with. Doesn't make much difference though.

<Lightlugia> Minnet: how are you?
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Lightlugia> Minnet: hug?
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Staeld> your colour is 06, but there should be a control character in front of that which tells clients the number means a colour.
<Staeld> also
<Staeld> you need to put her name behind the question if it's not a command.
<Staeld> g'morrow, Minnet
<Minnet> Good evening, Staeld.
<Staeld> she should recognise some slang/dialect as well as proper wordings.
<Staeld> it's not exactly beautiful coding, but it works somehow
<Lightlugia> Minnet: errow, Minnet
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Staeld> skip the first mention :p
<Lightlugia> errow, Minnet
<Staeld> I didn't know that wording though. Should I add it? :p

<Manlyguy> Until he hosts, of course. . -.
<Ray> 02._.
<Ray> 02why don't you host?
<Manlyguy> Cause I told him to host once he's ready.
<Manlyguy> And I don't want other people joining my room. lol
<Ray> 02lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I have no idea where my remote is
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And...I'm still having too much fun messing with Haii's head
<Pattyrick> I lost the remote for my ____________ TV

<drf|laptop> 03Playing with dangerous chemicals is both fun and completely annoying
<drf|laptop> 03my finger fricking hurts now since I got acid all over it >_>
<Armads> capsaicin burns.
<Armads> they are fun.
<Armads> and prevent Armads from typing.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03we were using uh
<drf|laptop> 03sulfuric acid
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, it's on Manly's doublememe. He uploaded it to his profile and she commented there
<drf|laptop> 03dangerous stuff
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah.
<drf|laptop> 03that and sodium hydroxide (strong base)
<Armads> lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What's she saying now?
<Armads> sounds like a recipe for
<Armads> fun
<Armads> !!
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She took the whole meme seriously
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah but my lab partner was a complete idiot
<eXAKR> What meme?
<Armads> I don't think capsaicin is actually dangerous
<drf|laptop> 03I was about ready to murder him by the time class was done
<Armads> but that doesn't stop it from hurting like a mofo.
<eXAKR> !nightseas
*NightSeas puts leash on eXAKR and avoids ownership.
<eXAKR> oo
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Manly and my double meme we did together
<eXAKR> Link?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Literally...
<Armads> I couldn't play Oblivion for an entire weekend because my fingers wouldn't stop burning.
<Armads> it sucked.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://flashmagnanimous.deviantart.com/art/Double-Meme-With-Shiny-243643719
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I saw the meme on your page.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Armads, what were you doing with capsaicin or w/e it is?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah?
<Armads> basically I was just slicing peppers for chili.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oooh.
<Pattyrick> Are they Red Hot?
<drf|laptop> 03and capsaicin is what now?
<Armads> I had done this many times in the past but with no repercussions
*Pattyrick runs for Red Hot Chili Peppers
<Armads> it's the chemical that makes things spicy.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Haii's so... well, it goes without saying, but noobish.
<Manlyguy> You did not just link that, Shiny. XD
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of spicy
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I did so just link that
<Pattyrick> agreed, SL
<drf|laptop> 03you know that sour sugar stuff?
<Armads> I love spicy chili so I saw no problem with this
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason if I eat too many sour candies my tongue getls compoletely burned from it
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Are you talking about citric acid?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6@DRF.
<drf|laptop> 03is that what it's called?
<Armads> but I failed to realize that while handling the peppers, you're supposed to wear gloves.
<drf|laptop> 03it's the stuff that sour candies like Sour Skittles are coated in
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Sounds like it from your definition.
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, it totally burns
<drf|laptop> 03like literally
<Armads> I hate that stuff too lol :\
<drf|laptop> 03for several days
<drf|laptop> 03if you eat too much
<Pattyrick> if I disconnect soon, brb xD
<Armads> I don't really eat sour candies anymore because of it.
<drf|laptop> 03same
<drf|laptop> 03sometimes I'll wipe the sugar off
<drf|laptop> 03I just kinda don't get why they COAT the candy in that stuff
<drf|laptop> 03maybe like 1/3 that amount would be enough XD
<Armads> or just regular skittles
<Armads> 'cause they're superior anyway
<Armads> :d
<drf|laptop> 03true
<drf|laptop> 03I like Sour Patch Kids though
<Armads> sour patch kids are aight
<prince-dari> Some things make your tongue bleed if you eat too many of them.
<prince-dari> Like toxic waste sweets.
<drf|laptop> 03but some of those have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much citric acid on them
<Armads> but just like anything, the overuse of the sugar can kills 'em lol
<drf|laptop> 03I still call it "sour sugar", regardless what the actual name is
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03heck
<drf|laptop> 03I used to eat those candies in school, right
<drf|laptop> 03and my teachers would get mad that I'd spill the sugar all over the place
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like "it's not my fault there's half a pound of it loose in the bag..."
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm, Shiny?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm what?
<Armads> I'd just eat Swedish Fish 'cause lol no random crap in it
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I dunno if telling Haii to relax will benefit her in the long run.
<Pattyrick> (sorry to interrupt, but LOL on Haii's responses on your deviation, Manly xD)
<drf|laptop> 03YAY SWEDISH FISH
<drf|laptop> 03that's like my favorite candy ever
<Armads> :D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What's it matter? She won't take my advice anyways lmao
<drf|laptop> 03but for a while my school ran out of swedish fish
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I guess...
<drf|laptop> 03so I resorted to sour patch kids XD
<Armads> XD
<Armads> poor danny :(
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But do you care to explain?
<drf|laptop> 03because I used to be addicted to eating two bags of candy a day
<drf|laptop> 03in my physics class
<Pattyrick> I gave her some advice, and she seems to be a bit better
<drf|laptop> 03yay unhealthy?
<Armads> well, you know what they say
<Armads> everything in moderation
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Armads> including moderation itself.
*Shadow_Lugia 6just realized that Shiny's question was at her.
<drf|laptop> 03but I have a feeling 2 bags of candy a day is a bit more than they meant :P
*Shadow_Lugia 6gets a response:
<Armads> moderation's meaningless if you don't ignore it once in a while :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 +h
*drf|laptop hides
<Armads> ic wut u did thar
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Should Haii treat criticism as a joke?
<drf|laptop> 03haha @ how Judge Judy just pronounced "shihtzhu" or whatever it is
<drf|laptop> 03I actually thought she swore for a second.
<Pattyrick> No, she shouldn't
<eXAKR> oo
<drf|laptop> 03god, these cases make me sick to the stomach
<drf|laptop> 03when someone sues someone else for hurting their pets
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She doesn't already?
<drf|laptop> 03EW ANIMAL ABUSE
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I mean, not in a joking kind of sense, but she doesn't take that seriously
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But now she'll have an excuse not to.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That is, if she follows that.
<Armads> I have so many windows open right now rofl
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I believe I worded it to saying she shouldn't take things that are for laughs too seriously
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She cannot give the excuse I told her so if she misread it
<Pattyrick> I talked with her and figured a few things out, and I also tried to talk to her about whatever issue she had, so I was hoping that might've solved something
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Assuming she follows that logic.
<drf|laptop> 03why are we still talking about haii
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Recent notice.
<Pattyrick> because she's gett
<Pattyrick> that
<drf|laptop> 03recent notice?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm mildly curious that she hadn't responded to that Lugiram sprite.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You were too busy to notice me talking about it drf
<Manlyguy> lol
<Pattyrick> :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03"You haven't even heard my thing"
<drf|laptop> 03Such educated defendants.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah, look, Haii responds by avoiding the brought-up point.
<Pattyrick> Haii has been a *LITTLE* better, in terms of not responding to the trolls, but she has a ways to go on effective arguing
<eXAKR> http://janeya.deviantart.com/ <- Why does this person know so many TST people? oo
<eXAKR> Also, lol Haii
*Shadow_Lugia 6isn't in the list. :O

<Pattyrick> I know somebody who's description that matches
<eXAKR> Ah K
<Pattyrick> yup, that's it Sky xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I should probably stop, I'm flooding Manly's picture with uneeded comments
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Personally, I wouldn't want Haii to have the last word. :P
<Pattyrick> yup
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She's going to
<Pattyrick> it's like she always has to have the last word, I've noticed
<Lucas> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Lucas for 20 minutes and has to fly Lucas around until then
<Lucas> ;3
<Pattyrick> whether it be more words or (|\
<Lucas> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Lucas for 6 minutes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I feel like she will even if the word is "...."
<Pattyrick> yup
<Manlyguy> Still going on about Haii? lmfao
<Pattyrick> and LOL Armads, lots of tabs open
<Manlyguy> And Ray, I'm done. lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<drf|laptop> 03sigh, I hate when torrent trackers don't work right
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02We're going on about how much I love you Manly
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<eXAKR> Can we talk about something
<eXAKR> OTHER than HaiiTehReshiram?
*Ray nickalert'd
<Pattyrick> Like....
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I thought we were
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I was talking about how much I love Manly
<Ray> 02Oh well, Join when can Manly :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Y U NO READ MY WORDS?
<Pattyrick> roller coasters would be my expected response
<Pattyrick> but something other than them...
<Manlyguy> <3
<Manlyguy> Shineh.
<Pattyrick> the Grand Canyon?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Manleh
<Pattyrick> although Manly and Shiny seem to be good topics, too
<Lakorv> Grand Canyon is nice.
<Lakorv> it's also grand.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Like how cute I am? And how manly Manly is?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, after losing this court, this guy just threatened to sue Judge Judy
<drf|laptop> 03Sore losers are funny sometimes
<drf|laptop> 03er *losing this case
<Pattyrick> we now return to the Shiny-Manly 1940's black & white love movie already in progress

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02We need a good song to listen to whilst fighting Jhenny
<Pattyrick> The Pretender by the Foo Fighters
<Manlyguy> I suggest Lady.
<Lakorv> I approve of The Pretender.
<Pattyrick> oh, and who's Jhenny?
<Armads> bah
<Armads> I wish I had a :D drive
<Armads> instead of a D: drive
<Armads> friggin busted piece of crap
<Pattyrick> I have a :| drive right now, but hopefully I can upgrade to a :D drive after riding some good rides at Miragica on Saturday
<Armads> might be leaving in a few to go to a place of interest
<Armads> after these discs quit being fagtards and get burned.
*Lakorv has a floppy drive.
<Armads> lol
<Pattyrick> I've never heard fagtard before, Armads
<Pattyrick> thank you for expanding my vocabulary :B
<Armads> yw lol
*Armads has two DVD drives, one of which works
*Ray waits .-. :| ._. |: .-.
*Pattyrick|drawing has a disk drive on his PC, but no floppy drive
<Manlyguy> My bad. p:
<Lakorv> 1.44MB floppies
<Lakorv> I have an unused one
<Lakorv> still in original casing
<Armads> just as a relic or something? lol
<Lakorv> more or less, yeah
<Armads> I have my old computer's 80GB hard drive that I use as a hand mirror.
<Lakorv> it's probably demagnetised by now anyway.
<Lakorv> Armads: my secondary disk is a 40GB one..
<Armads> I have the rest of the pieces in a box by my closet.
<Lakorv> and it's still operating. It's what holds my OS, infact.
<Pattyrick> lol, I remember when I got a game on a floppy disk from KFC in 2003
<eXAKR> Oo 80 and 40 GB hard disks
<Armads> lol
<eXAKR> And whut
<Armads> My computers only have one hard drive each, and I don't think they can support more.
<Armads> prebuilt by manufacturers, etc
<Lakorv> I have a spacy desktop tower.
<Lakorv> loads of space for drives and air.
<Lakorv> laptop is just a single hdd though.
<Armads> I wanna build a desktop one day. With fancy things.
<Armads> Till then I have two laptops and no cash. lol
<Lakorv> that said, my desktop is self-built and old.
<Lakorv> it's got an Opteron 185 and a GeForce 7300 LE.. say no more.
<Armads> lolol
<Armads> My hardware isn't too fancy either, 'specially my hard drive(s)
<Pattyrick> amazing how those little thin disks were used less than 10 years ago
<Armads> 150GB
<Armads> It gets full on a regular basis these days.
<Lakorv> I've a 250 and a 40 GB drive in the desktop.
<Armads> I keep most of my crap on externals now.
<NightSeas> 12Back
<Armads> games, backups, more games etc
<Lakorv> My laptop is encrypted, and my sd card is the key~
<Armads> lol, that's cool :o
<Armads> My wireless is encrypted and I'm the key.
<Armads> lol
<Manlyguy> gtfo NightSeas.
<Lakorv> to log on without the sd card
<Pattyrick> WOW MANLY
<Armads> mac filtering is cool.
<Lakorv> you need four passwords.
<Lakorv> with it, you only need three.
<NightSeas> 12Hey Manlyguy
<Pattyrick> Wb, GL
<Armads> lolol
<NightSeas> 12xD
<drf|laptop> 03LOL encryption
<Creideiki> I find it mildly annoying that I cannot drive a car - ever.
<drf|laptop> 03that's completely pointless on a laptrop
<Armads> do you even know the fourth one? :P
<drf|laptop> 03*laptop
*Pattyrick pets GL to make sure he's ok
<NightSeas> 12Hi Pattyrick
<Lakorv> drf|laptop: is not
<drf|laptop> 03just don't let people use your laptop
<drf|laptop> 03plain and simple
<Lakorv> why the hell would you pretend it's useless?
<drf|laptop> 03because it is
<drf|laptop> 03well if you run Linux, maybe not
<Pattyrick> LOL arguing about encryption on a laptop
<drf|laptop> 03but if you have Windows, and you have a password on it, just boot up a live boot ubuntu and steal all the files./
<Lakorv> that's the point, silly
<Lakorv> that's why you encrypt
<drf|laptop> 03not to mention, you can just wipe the data and have a nice shiny new laptop.
<Creideiki> Too bad US border securty breaks your whole encruption thing by doing their utmost to make your life hell until you let them snoop around your laptop. :P
<Lakorv> so you /can't/ steal the files
<Lakorv> because you need the password to decrypt them.
<drf|laptop> 03I prefer to just not have anything of value on there.
<Lakorv> not the os, but the files.
<Lakorv> and this is my school laptop, things /will/ be on it.
<Armads> I keep most things of value on my externals.
<Armads> external(s)
<drf|laptop> 03oh no somebody found a paper you wrote
<drf|laptop> 03what ever will you do
*drf|laptop hides
<Creideiki> drf|laptop: If it's someone taking that class... steal paper, take credit.
<Lakorv> drf|laptop: it's nice to know my accounts, files, etc won't be exposed if someone were to take my laptop.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Did someone call or was saying something was shiny?
<Pattyrick> LOL Shiny new laptop xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I figured when I saw talk about laptops
<Pattyrick> somebody said that
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03still, I just keep my laptop in my sight at all times so having a password on it is stupid.
<drf|laptop> 03besides when it's at my house, at least
<Lakorv> encryption adds on to passwords though.
<Lakorv> encryption for file security
<drf|laptop> 03well
*Pattyrick decides if he wants to add to the debate or not
<drf|laptop> 03it's more of a hassle
<Lakorv> passwords for os access.
<drf|laptop> 03I prefer just hitting power and having access to my computer.
<drf|laptop> 03rather than having to type in a password which is completely stupid anyway
<drf|laptop> 03at least on Windowsa
<drf|laptop> 03-a
<drf|laptop> 03because you can easily just delete the password
*Ray yaaawns
<Lakorv> yeah, but.. I run Linux and password != encryption.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Linux on laptos
<drf|laptop> 03*laptops
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<Manlyguy> Join the Shiny's room, Ray. lol
<Ray> 02lol
<Lakorv> lol hating on linux
<Creideiki> Eesh, linux on a laptop is pure hell.
<drf|laptop> 03I have my laptop set to completely unencrypted, no password, turn it on and it logs in type thing
<drf|laptop> 03I don't have anything against Linux
<drf|laptop> 03but what Creideiki said
<drf|laptop> 03I can see using it on a desktop but...
<Lakorv> Linux on this laptop works just as well as Windows.
<Lakorv> actually it works better.
<Armads> Armads must now depart for a place of interest
<Ray> 02Manly I have 3 free slots
<Armads> later peeps
<Ray> 02What should I do with them?
<Ray> 02xD
<Lakorv> I get longer battery time, working hotkeys and such things.
<Creideiki> Example of Linux on laptop WTF??? moments: "WHY in the name of Jesus, did my Intel wi-fi card not work with Intel drivers, BUT WORKS WITH WII DRIVERS!?"
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03that and it somehow heating wup more than it should
<drf|laptop> 03-w
<Manlyguy> Three slots for what, Ray? lol
<Creideiki> Also, someone Linux seems my display as 640x480 maximum size.
<Lakorv> drf|laptop: you must have a weird system if the OS makes it heat up.

<Pattyrick> brb
<Lakorv> Creideiki: wrong drivers, obviously.
<Ray> 023 Armor Slots xD
<Lakorv> thing about Linux is, either you know what you do or you take the blame.
<Creideiki> And Linux with the correct drivers for the card still doesn't want to go past 640x480.
<Creideiki> ...FreeBSD and OpenSolaris on the other hand...
<drf|laptop> 03<Lakorv> drf|laptop: you must have a weird system if the OS makes it heat up. <- it only heats up more on Ubuntu, Windows runs fine
<Lakorv> read my line again; must be a weird thing if it heats based on os.
<Creideiki> Well, to put it lightly, Debian made me want to sledgehammer the laptop. FBSD and OSOL work magnificantly. (Also, they have less "04HATE" moments.)
<Ray> 02Wheee
<Creideiki> Except for OSOL, that just doesn't like my wi-fi. :/
<Ray> 02Shiny (intended nickalert) I love this Derpternetz xD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I do too
<Ray> 02hi?
<Creideiki> Also, Linux on my desktop... "I CANNOT SEE ETHERNET CARDS? DOWNLOAD DRIVERS PLZ?"
<Manlyguy> That might be a problem with a monster like the Jhen.
<Ray> 02yeep It'll
<Creideiki> "Okay Linux, please go dial the modem." "MODEM NO EXIST."
<Creideiki> "I hate you Linux, I really, really do."

<Xanbreon> 06^!
<NightSeas> 12You don't need my permission. It's about not confusing me
<Roara|Plush> 6my guess is Angel will probably drop the nick for you anyways, since she really only goes by angel_espeon and angel_espy around here
<Xanbreon> 06I dont use it, and it was still in my group :(
<Roara|Plush> 6when was the last time it was used?

<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quanyails> 7Anyway, to Feather's request.

<Silverscreen> 11Anyway. It's funny, the only rain I had here at home is the storm that followed me from Pitt.
<Nittany_Tiger> You could make those images in Paint.

<_Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: if you can cross the canadian Border, then be my guest.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles' mic is worse, guarantee it
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay, 1 sec
<Nittany_Tiger> Ahh crap. No passport.
<Silverscreen> 11I heard. XD
<prince-dari> ...
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh well. I can always swim across the the river in Erie.
<_Dermathil> This is CGI
<_Dermathil> not gameplay.
<SirSprinkles> 6You need to add FlutterPeanut to the exceptions.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah,
<prince-dari> I knew I was going to forget someone.
<Silverscreen> 11alright, so I see that those we've accepted for modding are Rainbro (duh) and Sathi. What. Of. the others? The only reason their applications are in the mail account is because I don't know if they're yay or nay.
<Hipster_Brony> >implying peanut shows up anyway
<SirSprinkles> 6I had to count them all.
<_Dermathil> much closer from gameplay-looking CGI.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're waiting for this week to give Soarin a trial run.
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony else was a no.
<SirSprinkles> 6And we did reopen applications, just so you know...
<Silverscreen> 11Didn't soarin make it to this week's BMN for his trial?
<_Dermathil> SEE?
<_Dermathil> SHIT GRAPHICS
<SirSprinkles> 6He did, but there were server problems and he disappeared during them.
<Silverscreen> 11understood.
<Silverscreen> 11ah, I see.
<_Dermathil> even Snatchers looked better
<Nittany_Tiger> Get a better computer :p
<_Dermathil> My computer is good.
<Nittany_Tiger> J/k
<Hipster_Brony> im a little on the fence about him after he asked for a 3 day ban from ponychan
*Silverscreen 11has been playing Bioshock. It's f***ed up.
<_Dermathil> I run Crysis 2 on highest settings. Maybe it could run Crysis 1, I don't have it.
<Hipster_Brony> im not sure hes going to be committed
<_Dermathil> ALSO, NO AUTOSAVE system. Always manual save.
<SirSprinkles> 6As am I.
<Nittany_Tiger> Crysis 1 is much more graphics intensive than Crysis 2.
<_Dermathil> I know.
<SirSprinkles> 6I do want to see how he'll do and decide then though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Crysis 2 is a console port.
<_Dermathil> That's why I said maybe it could run C1, but I don't have it.
<_Dermathil> I KNOW
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 8Weepinbell.
<nickstr> I just have generations 1 and 2 on
<nickstr> so I recognize all of these
<Hipster_Brony> 8so pixel-y
<_Dermathil> The consoles use 2006 hardware, so it is obvious it isn't going to look as pretty as a pc-only title that melted every computer back in 2007
<Silverscreen> 11Did we interview isoscoles?

<L[a]korv> the fire canines are floofier though.
<Silverscreen> 11Pistols are easiest used with the stupid crosshairs rather than the manual aim.

<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 2Magneton.

<_Dermathil> I don't think it is with mods
<Hipster_Brony> wow, the video quality is really bad
<Silverscreen> 11...um....why is DashAttack's mail get sent to the spam folder? XD
<Aponymous> What is this?

<Hipster_Brony> no clue, silver
<Nittany_Tiger> I wish I could play Metro:2033 on my machine.
<_Dermathil> actually, the graphics-quality of this game makes me think of Oblivion.

<Elky> hey
<_Dermathil> I'm sure Metro is better than Stalker. Never got to play it though.
<Soarin> hi Elky
<Nittany_Tiger> Even with a brand new card, the games still lags too much for it to be playable.
<Aponymous> Hey Elky
<nickstr> not bad
<Elky> suddenly, ads
<SirSprinkles> 6Who?
<nickstr> but not exactly one of my favorites
<Quanyails> 7Feather, do you mind if I straighten out the edges of Scout-Ness's armholes?
<SirSprinkles> 6I just sent DashAttack one.

<SilverSonic> cya Hawkie
<_Dermathil> hey Aponymous.
<Nittany_Tiger> Quick single-cell event, or you were just on the edge of one.
<Silverscreen> 11I just sent Dash Attack one as well....
<Silverscreen> 11....
<Hawkie> 07Seeya :>
<Silverscreen> 11BWAHAHAHAHAHA!
<Aponymous> Hey _Dermathil
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Silverscreen> 11Anyway, I'll send out the Thursday update email tomorrow, that is, if my shitty dial-up will allow me to.
<Silverscreen> 11I forgot to send the Monday one.
<Silverscreen> 11Also, Hipster, if you don't mind, could you tell Sethisto of our email account and start using it to contact him for BMN?
<_Dermathil> not on the edge that I can assure you.
<_Dermathil> They basically form on top of our heads everyday for about ten minutes
<Pattyrick> gtg, goodnight! =D
<Hipster_Brony> sure
<Elky> when did you start?
<Nittany_Tiger> If only Environment Canada posted their radar feeds online.
<Hipster_Brony> 8about 10 minutes ago, elky
<_Dermathil> He started at about 18:45
<Silverscreen> 11Thanks. I'll do the same for ARGH.
<Elky> okay then, any important exposition?
<Silverscreen> 11Also, do we know what the status is on Fighting is Magic?
<Soarin> it's pretty much the first fight you get into
<Soarin> oh
<Soarin> you in the zone
<Elky> xD
<Soarin> stuff's radioactive
<ValtheJean> WHAAAAA?
<SirSprinkles> 6Haven't herd anything from them.
<_Dermathil> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
<Soarin> kill strelok
<ValtheJean> IMPOSSIBRU
<Hipster_Brony> no changes that im aware of

<Silverscreen> 11We can wait another month, then we should ask for an update so that we know when to start helping them out.
<Nittany_Tiger> http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/ctp/ <- would you rather have heat warnings or t-storms?
<Nittany_Tiger> Fucking heat.
<Quanyails> 7http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/2563/scoutnesspixel2.png <-- Edited some details.
<Silverscreen> 11sorry if I'm being pushy, it's just I'm short on time with this comp and Im trying to get as much done as I can. XD
<Elky> what kind of heat are we talking about here?
<Soarin> I'd rather have a nice, cold winter
<SirSprinkles> 6Guys, I'm going to email DesSur about the advert on his show. Cool with everypony?
<_Dermathil> I get thunderstorms and COLD winters.
*Quanyails 7mirror-flips the image and continues edits.
<Silverscreen> 11One of my workers got heat stroke today.
<Silverscreen> 11my mom's workers*
<Aponymous> I'd prefer cold weather too.
<_Dermathil> -30degrees celcius
<Silverscreen> 11advert?
<_Dermathil> in winter
<Silverscreen> 11That's The Brony Show, right?
<SirSprinkles> 6He does little 10 second adverts during his show.
<_Dermathil> +30degrees celsius in summer
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<Elky> about what we get too
<Silverscreen> 11???
<SirSprinkles> 6Magical Pony Theater 3000
<Elky> although it's more cold generally
<Silverscreen> 11I've been out for two weeks, so I'm a bit slow on the upkeep.
<Nittany_Tiger> Not hot desert weather. Just hot and humid weather.
<_Dermathil> Eh
<Silverscreen> 11o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6He came to us.
<Silverscreen> 11OH! I know now.
<SirSprinkles> 6It has only a few followers.
<Silverscreen> 11wait, what? o.O
<Silverscreen> 11no shit.
<Nittany_Tiger> This winter was really cold. First time I ever experience negative Fahrenheit temps. (I haven't lived in PA all of my life).
<_Dermathil> NIttany: The thunderstorms form around 6PM because of the heat and humidity that prevents the clouds from forming or something.
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<Nittany_Tiger> You mean a capping inversion?
<Silverscreen> 11Another stream came to us. That's awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
<_Dermathil> What's that?
<SirSprinkles> 6Also The Brony Show does wish to partner with us at some point, but that'll be down the line.
<Aponymous> This kinda reminds me of Fallout, except with Russians.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's when air temps rise with height.
<SirSprinkles> 6And will need to be worked out then, obviously.
<_Dermathil> Maybe its that, I dunno
<SirSprinkles> 6But they have been plugging us consistently.
<Silverscreen> 11Really? Awesome.
<Nittany_Tiger> Usually, temps do the opposite with height.
<Hipster_Brony> what did they have in mind?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's probably what's happening.
<_Dermathil> STRANGE, I remember looting multiple shotguns from that first fight.
<Silverscreen> 11We should save a full out partnership with them until after the Fighting is Magic thing, though.
<_Dermathil> shotties and SMGs
<Aponymous> Bulletproof dogs? Why haven't I played this?
<Soarin> they are pretty shitty anyway
<Soarin> as long as you aren't at point blank range they don't hit anything
<Nittany_Tiger> If you go from no clouds to "Suddenly, thunderclouds.", you've had a cap break.
<_Dermathil> Maybe that's what it is then
<Silverscreen> 11When that hits, our popularity will be through the roof. Making a partnership then would guarentee both parties an increase in people interested.
<Dashite> Woo Stalker!
<_Dermathil> BTW DCD, did you know about the suit in the roof?
<Elky> hi dashite
<Dashite> Sadly, this is as far as I've ever gotten. I need to go back to this.
*Silverscreen 11is in full business mode right now, with only 7 mins left on the library comp. XD
<_Dermathil> (Yeah I read the hints and tricks before starting to play. Didn't serve me anything
<SirSprinkles> 6They don't really have much in mind, just that they would like to partner. I haven't really talked much business with them.
<_Dermathil> Dashite: same. Well, Never went further than the spot where you gotta pay some dudes to pass under a bridge with a train on.
<Silverscreen> 11Did we ever actually advertise our steam group on here?
<_Dermathil> what I don't understand are the anomalies that don't hurt NPCs
<Soarin> It took me 3 or so attempts to actually finish the game
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<Soarin> because it's so flawed
<SirSprinkles> 6Briefly.
<SirSprinkles> 6We have a lot of followers on it.
<Soarin> but with mods I endured it
<SirSprinkles> 6Plus there's a link to it on the bottom of the site, so... *shrug*
<Soarin> and NPCs do die to anomalies
<ValtheJean> lol, I remember when I first saw an anomalie kill a dog, I thought it was some kind of freaky invisible alien
<_Dermathil> mind linking me to a mod that fixes the FRICKING AIMING PROBLEM? Oh, and one that permits autosaving every five minutes?
<Silverscreen> 11I have five minutes.
<Silverscreen> 11:|
<Soarin> I used some modpack
<Soarin> which fixed and improved a LOT
<Silverscreen> 11and my little cousin is bugging me to take her back. :|
<_Dermathil> that fixed the shitty aiming?
<Soarin> and added new stuff
<_Dermathil> LINK PLEASEE!!!
<Soarin> I don't know
<Soarin> the aiming is always shitty as far as I remember
<_Dermathil> the aiming can't be fixed?
<Soarin> so I'm not sure which part of shitty aiming you mean :p
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay... we decided August 26-28 for the LotR thing, yes?
<_Dermathil> the aiming down sight that's as imprecise as hipfiring
<Soarin> I think it was this: http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009
<Silverscreen> 11That's in the middle of the week, though.
<SirSprinkles> 6Is it?
<Silverscreen> 11I wouldn't make it to any of it unless we started after 5
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the weekend.
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Silverscreen> 11I'm on July. x.x
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Soarin> oh, the inaccurate aiming is probably just bad weapons at the beginning
<Soarin> it gets better
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, that weekend would work. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, we decided one movie, followed by two eps each night.
<SirSprinkles> 6That way we still have a reason for the lotto the previous week.
<SirSprinkles> 6A total of 6 picked eps.
<Silverscreen> 11I'll make sure not to schedule anything then.
<Silverscreen> 11Sounds good to me.
<_Dermathil> I meant the aiming that was mentioned in the reviews and such
<Silverscreen> 11I gotta go now. Library time's expired.
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright. Later.
<_Dermathil> DCD, do you know about the suit in the roof in the building behind Wolf?
<SirSprinkles> 6Good to get you caught up.
<Soarin> meh, I don't know, don't read reviews
<Hipster_Brony> see ya silver
<Silverscreen> 11The mail account's been tidied up and I have the Thrusday update saved on my laptop to send so long as my internet at home holds up.
<Silverscreen> 11See you all later.
<_Dermathil> BTW soarin' I'm so downloading that mod you linked. It looks GORGEOUS, and maybe could prevent me from getting motion sick again.
<Silverscreen> 11*aparates*
<Dashite> It's a fantastic mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6*has been slacking off on the email account*
<SirSprinkles> 6*has been busy with the actual site*
<_Dermathil> (That last thing could've been caused by the alcohol's effects ingame though)
<Soarin> mhm, it's the only thing that made me play it again
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<_Dermathil> The backdrop of pinkie's thing during Party Of one could've been a picasso in comparison to the mess that was my screen due to the blur

<Aponymous> That guys gonna cut his finger if he keeps doing that.
<_Dermathil> I never went beyond that checkpoint under the trainbridge
<Soarin> the "dungeons" are really good
<Soarin> basically everything that is underground
<_Dermathil> I hope, since I'm gonna try that thing again with that mod.
<_Dermathil> I also got Call of Pripyat but I never even started it up, since I wanted to finish SoC before.
<NewDCD> 9I hear one should play Vanilla first
<NewDCD> 9and mods later
<Soarin> nah
<NewDCD> 9I also hear Complete 2009 makes the game easier
<Soarin> it doesn't matter really
<Soarin> I couldn't bear vanilla
<_Dermathil> same, I can't even bear the game.
<Dashite> Normally I'd agree with you, but I think the Stalker complete mods are an exception to the general rule.
<Soarin> yup
<_Dermathil> DCD, follow the edge of the roof
<Soarin> they fix a lot of the stuff that's just bad in the game
<_Dermathil> you gotta get on top of this building's roof I think.
<Lambda> Hello
<_Dermathil> Then jump on the next building's roof
<_Dermathil> that one
<_Dermathil> yes
<Elky> inb4 slomo
<_Dermathil> save maybe?
<Elky> ouch
<Dashite> The dudes are laughing at you.
<Dashite> "Heh! Look at that idiot! He fell off the roof again!"
<Feather> 10I hate mirror flipping my pictures, they always look horrible when I do LOL
<_Dermathil> there we go
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (nickstr10) 11WB10»11•. 10- (3:17:02 PM) Yauncle[Eee]: welcome to the future, nickstr (3:17:18 PM) nickstr: sorry, I smoked a callender
<prince-dari> Hey Lambda.
<Elky> well, they're not laughing now...
<_Dermathil> there should be a hole in the roof somewhere with a chest in it
<_Dermathil> not necessarily that one
<Razyn> Save the game so you don't have to keep trying. End up doing it like a baws.
<_Dermathil> one of the corners I think
<Stormy> hi
<_Dermathil> look in that hole in the roof's corner?
<_Dermathil> there?
<_Dermathil> you gotta use a knife on the box
<_Dermathil> (unless I'm mistaken and all of that is for nothing)
<Lambda> how's it going?
<Stormy> alright
<Quanyails> 7Well, too late, Feather. :3
<Quanyails> 7I made my adjustments.
<Quanyails> 7Uploading again for your approval before I color. :
<Quanyails> 7:P*
<Stormy> we just beat that demon girl in ToS
<Feather> 10okay XD
<_Dermathil> THERE IT IS
<Razyn> Fuck the police indeed.
<Lambda> Oh nice, does it feel good to hjave that out of the way?
<prince-dari> What's all this for?
<desertman2> but how do you grab it?
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 10Octillery.
<Stormy> yeah
<_Dermathil> a suit
<Elky> fun?
<Quanyails> 7http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2563/scoutnesspixel2.png
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Razyn> God damnit DCD.
<_Dermathil> he already grabbed it
<Lambda> she was one of the most annoying bosses on our first playthrough
<nickstr> wow
<Stormy> we died the first time when it was just me and Jenna
<Stormy> then we prepared more
<nickstr> the water Pokemon that can use bullet seed
<ValtheJean> now sell it to see Dermathil's reaction :P
<_Dermathil> I won't care, its alot of money
<Lambda> were you able to beat her the same way we did?
<_Dermathil> But it got better stats than the suit he had before
<ValtheJean> MAYYYYYYYYYYYYBE
<Lambda> just comboing her to no end while COllette spams angel feathers?
<Dashite> No, he just thinks that you are are crazy.
<Quanyails> 7Jellicent can learn Energy Ball. :P
<Stormy> and Evan joined us
<Stormy> Yeah
<Razyn> Well hello there...
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 14Mantine.
<nickstr> wtf is that
<ValtheJean> Okay, then throw it on the ground and jump around while singing cupcakes
<nickstr> Jellicent
*Feather thumbs up :3
<_Dermathil> whatcha think of the Merc Suit Soarin?
<_Dermathil> is it a good item?
<Soarin> neat for the beginning
<Soarin> but it won't help for too long
<_Dermathil> yeah, It is something I found in a hints and trick section somewhere. Still surprised I remember it after a year
<Quanyails> 7Jellicent is a jellyfish. :P
<Quanyails> 7And thank you, Feather.
<Soarin> no
<Razyn> SMG all the way
<ValtheJean> nah
<_Dermathil> Soarin said no
<Soarin> don't waste your money
<ValtheJean> be a 1337 agent with awesome pistols
<Soarin> you get weapons everywhere on the road
<_Dermathil> Soarin is the person to listen.
<nickstr> TENTACOOL RIP OFF
<Soarin> yeah and when you don't have the ammo it's pretty useless
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 8Celebi.
<_Dermathil> I remember having found a special pistol too at one point.
<ValtheJean> Soarin has a point, a rule of shooters is that you'll always find more weapons
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02!pokemon
<Elky> roleplaying all the way, anything automatic is useless
<ScriptBot> Shiny-Growlithe, you are a 5Stunky.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<ValtheJean> and a rule of RPGs is anything you buy WILL be found 10 seconds later
<Soarin> SMGs aren't pretty good anyway in stalker
<Manlyguy> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Manlyguy, you are a 5Nidoqueen.
<prince-dari> ToS?
<Soarin> you want something as accurate as possible
<_Dermathil> what about shotguns soarin?
<Manlyguy> And then female.
<Soarin> so you don't have to waste a million ammo
<Lambda> Tales of Symphonia
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Soarin> I never used shotguns
<Lambda> great game
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 11Chikorita.
<Lambda> a hidden gem
<prince-dari> PC or console game?
<Lambda> console
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 2Squirtle.
<Roara|Plush> 6you devolved
<Lambda> it's for the gamecube and PS2, but I think only the gamecube version got ported outside Japan
<nickstr> nope
<_Dermathil> I remember them being useful against big animals when they get real close in the beginning.
<nickstr> I became a water Pokemon
<Soarin> basically once you meet the military guys you don't need to worry about ammo/weapons for a while
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Soarin> yeah maybe
<Roara|Plush> 6blasphemy
<Soarin> but more weapons = more weight
<_Dermathil> I also remember having shot at the militaries at the beginning to lead them to the starting point
<prince-dari> 1. Go to http://lockfale.com/
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> 2. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, ba
<prince-dari> 3. ????
<Lambda> the konami code thing
<prince-dari> 4. Profit
<prince-dari> XD
<Lambda> I've done this before
<Lambda> it's pretty cool
<Elky> vodka helps you agaist radiation?
<Razyn> Vodka? What's that do?
<Hipster_Brony> 8>vodka makes you immune to radiation
<desertman2> gets you drunk
<prince-dari> ba? O_o -b* XD
<Soarin> lowers radiation
<Elky> xD
<Soarin> if i remember right
<Hipster_Brony> 8AWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH
<_Dermathil> yeah, i remembered getting motion sickness because I had too much radiation and drank enough vodka to turn it back to zero
<Razyn> Are you shitting me.
<Aponymous> Note to self: Buy more vodka
<Elky> more like you don't care about the radiation anymore
<prince-dari> Ohai Ghosties.
<_Dermathil> I am not Razyn.
<Ghosties> Yes, I am shitting you
<Soarin> it's stalker logic at it's finest
<Elky> ohai ghosties
<_Dermathil> Hey Ghosties
<Soarin> heya ghosties
<Dashite> Vodka, official drink of the post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland.
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai ghosties
<Aponymous> Ghosties, OHAI
<Hipster_Brony> 8hows your sex life?
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 12Espeon.
<ValtheJean> it's the same reason that cigarettes increase your EVE in Bioshock :P
<Razyn> I am not _DErmathil
<Ghosties> 4Hello everyone, sorry I'm late I had to help my mom with her acting class
*nickstr tears up Roara|Plush
<Roara|Plush> 6OH GOD
<_Dermathil> I remember never even reaching that farm.
<Roara|Plush> 6I want
<Roara|Plush> 6!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Roara|Plush, you are a 11Chikorita.
<Elky> why?
<Roara|Plush> 6....lol
<_Dermathil> Never got through that cordon
<nickstr> it just so happens I LIKE water Pokemon
<Ghosties> 4What is our resident streamer streaming this night?
<prince-dari> SR turned up in the movie night stream channel when there were over 200 people.
<_Dermathil> STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl
<prince-dari> I think he was wondering WTH was going on.
<Dashite> STALKER
<Roara|Plush> 6it just so happens, I adore espeons
<Lambda> XD the brony one?
<Roara|Plush> 6D:
<Ghosties> 4Looks interesting
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dashite> DAMN YOU!
<_Dermathil> SO NINJA'D YOU DASHITE
<Ghosties> 4Is it on Steam?
<Soarin> vodka games
<Dashite> Yes
<Soarin> it is indeed
<ValtheJean> yeah
<Lambda> maybe he IS a brony after all!
<Elky> so we're in chernobyl right now?
<_Dermathil> I TYPED THE WHOLE NAME
<Lambda> :O
<Soarin> yup
<_Dermathil> Elky: Chernobyl is way north
<prince-dari> I switched it over to this network at least temporarily because of all the netsplits on the one we were on.
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 11Poliwrath.
<Dashite> I wasn't paying attention. :/
<_Dermathil> Ghosties: yeah. It is on steam.
<_Dermathil> But looks horrible
<Razyn> DCD: Confirming shit like a boss.
<Soarin> well it's chernobyl surrounding
<prince-dari> So it's more likely because it was 20 times bigger than any other channel. XD
<Soarin> called the zone
<nickstr> don't bash what I like and I will not bash what you like
<nickstr> sound fair?
<_Dermathil> ^^
<_Dermathil> helicopter? wut?
<Elky> and the protagonist can't get out?
<_Dermathil> nope
<Lambda> Haha
<Soarin> the protagonist doesn't want to get out
<Elky> sorry, I just like to know the story behind a game...
<_Dermathil> military quarantined the whole area
<Roara|Plush> 6..
*Shiny-Growlithe lol'd
<Roara|Plush> 6I wasn't bashing, what the heck are you on about
<Soarin> because you can earn lots of russianmoney with artifacts
<Elky> so he's driven by greed
<Elky> artifacts
<nickstr> you said me getting a water Pokemon was "blasphemy"
<Stormy> there were 200 people in a channel on this network?
<_Dermathil> WUT
<Stormy> o.o
<Roara|Plush> 6um
<Roara|Plush> 6ok....I guess I wont joke around with you then
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Roara|Plush> 6I've never known anyone to take the word "blasphemy" seriously
<Razyn> I heard of that... I think. But where?
<Roara|Plush> 6which...i guess is ironic
<Roara|Plush> 6anyways
<Roara|Plush> 6sorry, I didn't think you'd take that seriously
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 13Kangaskhan.
<_Dermathil> WUT
<Roara|Plush> 6I was saying blasphemy about you changing from chikorita to squirtle
<Razyn> TUW
<nickstr> oh
<Soarin> and then the stream was killing floor
<Elky> let's watch DCD browse ponychan for four hours
<_Dermathil> I be feeling like testing that mod I downloaded thanks to Soarin'
<Dashite> Am I a bad person for wanting to friend DCD just to spam the video with steam messages?
<Roara|Plush> 6yeah
<desertman2> lots of shortcut icons
<Razyn> I think I heard of it because of ponies...
<ValtheJean> lol
<desertman2> yes
<Soarin> go for it, derma :p
<prince-dari> Yes, a very bad person. :P
<_Dermathil> HOLY SHIT 30minutes of DLing left for that mod
<Stormy> wow
<Dashite> Someone needs to clean up their desktop.
<Elky> implying anyone uses their desktops
<ValtheJean> Be a CREDIT TO TEAM and play TF2!
<NewDCD> 9I am the lazy
<prince-dari> There are 17 people still around, watching someone stream killing floor or something.
<_Dermathil> TF2!!!!
<_Dermathil> I WANNA SNIPE SOME MOAR
<Stormy> 17 is still a lot for this network though
<Dashite> I don't use my desktop at all. Desktop has no icons.
<Stormy> XD
<ValtheJean> lol, I've actually been considering going back to TF2
<Stormy> it's more than #epic-chat
<NewDCD> 9'cept I suck at TF2
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 6Dewgong.
<ValtheJean> though I'll have to learn all of the rediculous items they made
*_Dermathil fires rocket lawnchair at ground below. He then sits in the chair.
<prince-dari> So it's still the biggest channel.
<Dashite> CRY SUM MOAR!
<prince-dari> Lol. XD
<NewDCD> 9at least in Floor of Killing I am somewhat decent
<ValtheJean> haha, but then we can laugh at you!
<_Dermathil> I don't have KF
<Stormy> this network is kind of pathetically tiny, isn't it?
<Stormy> XD
<NewDCD> 9I'm not "so bad it's good"
<desertman2> I haven't gotten a single item in TF2 for a while
<Elky> I just have regular stuff on my desktop, but I nver look at it outside of folder view
<Dashite> Me neither. :(
<NewDCD> 9I'm "so bad it's horrible"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Shiny-Growlithe, you are a 14Banette.
<ValtheJean> awww
<prince-dari> Yeah, I suppose.
*Razyn grabs prototype lawnchair he never returned and shoots a seat.
<ValtheJean> we still <3 despite being a noob :P
<prince-dari> I hadn't realised until recently.
<Razyn> *rocket lawnchair
<Manlyguy> Fits perfectly, imo.
<prince-dari> When I /list and see there's something like 20 different people on the network.
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 13Hypno.
<Roara|Plush> 6banettes are cool lol
<Luna> Auroaraaaaa. I got all this stuff to make my first plush, and I had decided on Kirby. So I went to get fabric and stuffing, and buying enough would've made me broke!
<Roara|Plush> 6but their pokedex entry is trippy
<Ghosties> 4For those curious, yes, that was me. I will be joining DCD in a session of Killing Floor
<Roara|Plush> 6luna, what fabric were you going at?
<NewDCD> 9KILLING FLOOR
<NewDCD> 9Y U NO BOOT
<Luna> Some stuff from Wal-Mart
<ValtheJean> never actually seen KF, so this should be interesting :P
<Elky> me neither
<Aponymous> Same here
<Elky> the stream is getting experimental...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If you want a trippy Pokedex
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 6Eevee.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Look at Darumaka's
<Dashite> I played it during a free weekend once.
<Stormy> Mine won't tell me that
<Roara|Plush> 6lol walmart suckls for one thing
<ValtheJean> evil clown!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh wait no that's for laughs
<Razyn> Clown.
<Roara|Plush> 6shiny, yamask, end of story
<Soarin> Killing Floor is pretty neat
<Stormy> It only lists all the channels and how many people are in them
<Aponymous> OH GOD A CLOWN!
<Elky> so is it a story driven game?
<Dashite> Nope.
<Soarin> especially if you play it with bros
<desertman2> no
<nickstr> not when you can get stuff that would be hideously expensive elsewhere fairly cheap
<Stormy> brb
<ValtheJean> that zombie fails as sword eating
<Soarin> it's a DOSH driven game
<Dashite> A wut?
<Roara|Plush> 6yeah well
<Elky> DOSH?
<Roara|Plush> 6in this case
<Roara|Plush> 6it sucks
<Lambda> k
<Soarin> DOSH.
<Razyn> DOSH?
<Roara|Plush> 6you don't go to walmart for fabric
<Luna> There were no other fabric stores around where I live
<Elky> DOSH?
<Luna> *are
<Dashite> EXPLAIN!
<Soarin> it's all about the DOSH
<Elky> or don't
<Roara|Plush> 6since when does walmart even sell fabric?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lol wow
<ValtheJean> did anyone else see the spartan head on that zombie back a few images ago?
<prince-dari> "Current Global Users: 48 Max: 220"
<Aponymous> MONKEY WITH A CHAINSAW!
<Elky> I can work with that explanatiob
<Manlyguy> I'm with Roara on this. lmfao
<Dashite> I saw the crazy monkey.
<Dashite> Does that count?
<Elky> much more funny to find out yourself
<ValtheJean> sure :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But for laughs, I'm still going with Darumaka
<Dashite> Derp is on.
<Luna> It's been there, there isn't much to pick from, but it is there
<Roara|Plush> 6there are a lot of fabric stores online that sell for fairly cheap
<NewDCD> 9I doubt you can hear my mic
<NewDCD> 9but I'm gonna need to voice communicate during the game
<ValtheJean> Blitzcrank!
<Elky> so the game is like fighting an evil circus?
<Soarin> If you aren't full I can join
<desertman2> Only for the dlc
<NewDCD> 9no Elky, it's fightan zombies
<NewDCD> 9Soarin
<Soarin> though I barely played it
<NewDCD> 9get your ass over here
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<nickstr> issue there is you have to pay shipping
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Aw bull no One Piece this week
<Razyn> Why is there a boiler-mech at a carnival?
<Soarin> okey dokey
<NewDCD> 9just for the seasonal event
<Elky> circus zombies
<desertman2> why not?
<nickstr> which is a huge problem if you need something quick
<NewDCD> 9BECAUSE
<Elky> EUROPE
<ValtheJean> spartan head!
<Dashite> NORTH AMERICA
<NewDCD> 9quality's pretty bad though
<NewDCD> 9let me fix that
<Aponymous> DEM ARMS
<Roara|Plush> 6how quick do you need it?
<Dashite> DEM HANDS!
<Roara|Plush> 6my fur shipped in a few days, one of which was a sunday
<Dashite> At least, I think they were hands.
<Roara|Plush> 6also...what's your budget
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My kitten keeps trying to sit in the windowsill when it's not open
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:|
<Elky> hands are too mainstream
<Roara|Plush> 6because unfortunately, plush making in itself is fairly expensive
<Aponymous> I use hooks.
<Razyn> I use claws
<Luna> I was hoping to just test how well I could do it, I was looking for <$20
<Lambda> what is #bronystatemods for?
<Dashite> Am I the only one that still has hands?!
<Lambda> is that that movie channel you're talking about?
<Soarin> >friend request sent
<Elky> I only use custom imported paperclip constructions
<Roara|Plush> 6for an entire plush?
<Razyn> I have hands, their just not attached
<Soarin> oh, yeah, name's daaren on steam
<Luna> It wasn't a complicated one
<Roara|Plush> 6I know but still
<Aponymous> God Chainsaw monkey id freaky
<Roara|Plush> 6fabric runs usually at $5-$7 a yard
<prince-dari> Nah, that's our mod channel.
<Roara|Plush> 6which is like minimum for a small plush
<prince-dari> Which you can't get into anyway.
<Aponymous> *is
<prince-dari> It's just #bronystate
<Aponymous> Damn hooks
<Roara|Plush> 6but that's also for really cheap fabric
<NewDCD> 9there we go
<NewDCD> 9fixed
<Lambda> ah
<Elky> tbh, I don't see much of a diference
<Luna> Ah
<Roara|Plush> 6if you can get ahold of antipill fleece, that's your best bet
<Elky> not that it looks bad
<Roara|Plush> 6it's the cheapest for being still decent quality
<Elky> it just was okay before too
<Luna> You're able to buy less than a yard though, right?
<Roara|Plush> 6yeah
<NewDCD> 9look at the letters
<_Dermathil> alright, I'll be probably waiting for the mod to finish DLing so I can see if Shadow of Chernobyl is worth spending multiple hours on.
<NewDCD> 9much less fuzzy
<Elky> hm
<Soarin> now I need a third monitor
<Soarin> for game, stream and irc
<NewDCD> 9images WILL be crisper like this
<Dashite> A third monitor would be so nice.
<NewDCD> 9I only have one
<NewDCD> 9and I deal w/it
<Elky> for what?
<Elky> one monitor for gaming, one for chat, the third...
<nickstr> if I wanted one I would have to comission one or settle for something
<nickstr> I can't sew
<Dashite> Streaming porn.
<Elky> for constant pony episodes?
<Dashite> What else?
<Elky> oh, that works too
<Luna> Sewing isn't too bad. I sucked at it until I went to a convention and had to practice
<Dashite> For the extra awkwardness, have the porn play over your speakers so everyone else you talk to can hear it.
<Razyn> Aha! I found it! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/28316
<Razyn> That would have bugged me all night.
<Dashite> It's not loading. What is it?
<NewDCD> 9it takes a while, dog
<Dashite> Ah, there it goes.
<Luna> I'll look for that type of fabric though. I'd rather not order online unless I decide to commit, it's getting to the stores that is the problem
<Dashite> I hear you...
<Elky> split up!
<ValtheJean> so I'm guessing this is kind of like L4D?
<Dashite> That always works in the movies!
<Dashite> It
<Dashite> It's more like COD zombies.
<nickstr> I actually passed up a giant stuffed Pikachu due to not much interest and being in a midway game that is impossible to win at the county fair
<Elky> everything I know about zombies I learned for Evil Dead 2
<prince-dari> Dat recoil
<Elky> from*
<Dashite> Except with different types of zombies.
<_Dermathil> 20 minutes remaining of waiting for the DL to finish
<nickstr> if it was a Togepi I would have gone for it
<Razyn> Machete. Coolest Melee, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
<Luna> Those things are always rigged
<Luna> Unless it's the "guess your weight" game
<Luna> The guy over here that does it sucks
<nickstr> they are
<nickstr> that is why I passed it up
<nickstr> not worth the effort
<Luna> They have some neat stuff though
<Luna> Last year, they had a spongebob clock. Which sounds really childish but..
<Luna> A spongebob clock! I wanted it
<SoiPony> so I see that I'm on the screen :D

<Lambda> Haha
<Armageddon> prince-dari
<Armageddon> I squit'd the server
<prince-dari> ?
<baadf00d> dude me too
<prince-dari> I was just making a joke. :P
<Armageddon> lol I know :p
<Zoroark> why so color
<Armageddon> and jesus crap, I'm lagging like shit
<drf-Droid> someone claimed Eminem named his {censored} Hailie and I'm sitting here thinking "...wtf? that's his daughter you idiot"
<Lambda> Stormy, I don't know if you saw my last post in pony spam yet but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2kqq922Oz4
<SilverSonic> XD
<baadf00d> maybe he named his daughter after it
<baadf00d> ya never know with celebrities.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<baadf00d> always doin weird crap.
<drf-Droid> still, that whole article was a major facepalm
<baadf00d> lol
<drf-Droid> he was trying to prove why Eminem is "bad for society"
<drf-Droid> and mixing facts up
<baadf00d> rofl
<drf-Droid> he said Eminem made the song Hot In Herre
<Dashite> Pwned
<baadf00d> well rap in general is bad for society
<drf-Droid> I was like, no.
<baadf00d> but for different reasons
<drf-Droid> yeah, y u use n-word
<desertman2> so close to winning
<Razyn> Hubba wha?
<Dashite> Yet so far...
<Quanyails> 7Is dA borking for anyone else?
<Glacymr> 12somehow i read that as drf-bad
<prince-dari> Lol at the ending.
<Roara|Plush> 6nope
<Sneas> 03i
<prince-dari> Atmosphere - ruined. XD
<Lambda> :P
<Sneas> 03h x
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<drf-Droid> implying dA ever worked
<Glacymr> 12SilverSonic i'm surprised
<drf-Droid> I don't remember the last time that site loaded in under 30 seconds
<Glacymr> 12you mustered up the effort to change your nick
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I can't put a comment on the site.
<drf-Droid> dA is one large trollfest
<drf-Droid> there are much better ways to share artwork
<drf-Droid> getting your own server and hotlinking anyone?
<Roara|Plush> 6well let us do as we please
<Armads> drf
<Roara|Plush> 6some of us enjoy it
<Armads> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/060/2/5/trollface_ftw_by_6661_apocalyptik-d3apyms.png
<drf-Droid> did I ever once say you can't do it?
<drf-Droid> and Armads, would rather not break my phone right now
<Quanyails> 7You're insinuating we leave it and find a better method.
<Armads> I would rather break your phone :(
*Armads runs
<Roara|Plush> 6you're making it-
<Roara|Plush> 6what quan said
<drf-Droid> then you're taking what I say far too seriously.
<drf-Droid> which I suppose, I should be glad people actually listen to my rants :)
<SilverSonic> <%Glacymr> SilverSonic i'm surprised
<SilverSonic> <%Glacymr> you mustered up the effort to change your nick <-- LOL
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I'll deal with you later, DRF.
<Glacymr> 12wb'
<Quanyails> 7Well, not me.
<Roara|Plush> 6or maybe for once just not say anything about what people should and shouldn't do
<drf-Droid> 'deal with'?
<Roara|Plush> 6or inferring such
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Roara|Plush> 6it's somewhat insulting, degrading, etc
<prince-dari> She's clearly going to make you into cupcakes drf.
<prince-dari> Watch out.
<drf-Droid> so in other words you can say w/e you want but I can't disagree?
<Armads> XD
<drf-Droid> that's fair.
<Roara|Plush> 6...
<Quanyails> 7You can disagree, but not persuade.
<Roara|Plush> 6what did /I/ say
<NewDCD> 9we're live
<drf-Droid> I'm not persuading
<Roara|Plush> 6I normally say some remark against what you say
<drf-Droid> I just said dA is a large trollfest
<Dashite> Just saw it go back up.
<Roara|Plush> 6and that there's better ways to share artwork, and that we should find something else
<drf-Droid> I never said "you all suck if you use it"
<Quanyails> 7Yet 'dA is a large trollfest'.
<drf-Droid> yay impeding on freedom of speech, then? all I said was that there's better ways to share art, I never said you can't or shouldn't use dA
<Dashite> You guys need to pick up Alien Swarm 4p co-op and it's free.
<Roara|Plush> 6ok well you kind of do this all the time
<Armads> so in other words
<Armads> drf gave his opinion
<Roara|Plush> 6so it's getting really aggravating
<Armads> again
<Armads> and no one cares about it
<Armads> again
<Armads> lolol
<Nittany_Tiger> Hey. Killing Floor. I have that.
<Armads> let's try not to make this place into the trollfest, guys. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> And I also have Alien Swarm.
<prince-dari> I like the way you think Armads.
<Armads> That would make me sad.
<Roara|Plush> 6lol
<NewDCD> 9I bugged out
<Nittany_Tiger> No-one really plays it anymore, though.
<Roara|Plush> 6this is a daily habit I think
<Roara|Plush> 6arguments and such
<Dashite> Yeah, I noticed that when I loaded it up a couple weeks ago.
<NewDCD> 9I have Alien Swarm 2
<NewDCD> 9got it off the free thing
<Roara|Plush> 6anyways, plush to work on
<desertman2> alien breed 2
<desertman2> not swarm
<Quanyails> 7Sprites to do!
<drf-Droid> if you think I argue on a daily basis, you should check your logs :) because I've cut back a LOT
<Dashite> Yeah, not the same.
<Armads> man, that TST is such a trollfest
<Armads> that Armads always trollin all over the place
<NewDCD> 9oh that
<NewDCD> 9wait
<drf-Droid> Armads, I know right
<NewDCD> 9wasn't swarm the one you had to pay for?
<NewDCD> 9oh wait nvm
<desertman2> No
<NewDCD> 9wasn't swarm free?
<Dashite> Nope.
<Dashite> Swarm is free.
<desertman2> yes
<Nittany_Tiger> Swarm is free.
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
*Armads in b4 Weird Al WHEN THEY SEE ME TROLLIN
<Quanyails> 7I miss the old topic.
<Nittany_Tiger> + modding tools.
<drf-Droid> which one?
<Dashite> Valve gave it away free last summer I think?
<Nittany_Tiger> Make Parasprite Swarm.
<Armads> the one about fishcakes
<Armads> I mean
<Armads> cupcakes.
<Armads> o.o fishcakes
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> Fund it.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was around March '10
<desertman2> Alien swarm is one of steam's free games
<drf-Droid> no but really, which one?
<Armads> fund it, like a product? lol
<Armads> fishcakes™. Fund it.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wish they had made new missions for it.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Armads> probably the topic before things got all srs, drf. lol
<desertman2> most people just play it for the hat
<Dashite> Might have helped keep it alive a little longer.
<drf-Droid> I seem to recall the topic starting with the same message for years though
<Armads> the one I'm positive I don't remember in the slightest
<Armads> the topic of the conversation, not the chan lol
<Armads> though you could be rebellious and change it :O
<Armads> just to say you did.
<drf-Droid> I would, but to what?
<Nittany_Tiger> I hated it when you'd get an "one man army" team member that'd leave everyone else behind.
<Armads> "fishcakes™. Fund it."
*Armads runs
<NewDCD> 9we're live
<prince-dari> LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> Happened more on lover difficulties.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> *lower
<drf-Droid> a little too short
<Ray||Away> 02baaaack
<Razyn> Lover Difficulties
<Razyn> Are best difficulties
<desertman2> oh, the ones that go on speed runs without telling anyone?
<Dashite> It's not my fault I swear!
<Dashite> I wasn't trying to light you guys on fire!
<Ray||bath> 02brb
<prince-dari> ...
<Nittany_Tiger> Pretty much desert.
<Manlyguy> I lol'd.
<prince-dari> What is this, twitter?
<Armads> getting there, dari. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Just like "Fuck you! I'm going alone."
<Ray||bath> 02LOLno.
<drf-Droid> EW TWITTER
*Armads /nick Armads|dunking a cookie in milk
<prince-dari> Lol Armads.
*Armads /nick Armads|eating said cookie
<Armads> etc
<Manlyguy> Kinda why I never really hung around the chat.
<Nittany_Tiger> I started playing on hard after I met people doing that on normal. The higher difficulty inhibited that "one man army" crap.
<Manlyguy> Too much telling of every action. lol
<Ray||bath> 02So true, lmfao
<drf-Droid> I know right
<Armads> GUYS.
<Armads> I AM TYPING.
<Armads> just to let you all know.
<prince-dari> If IRC was normally like twitter I wouldn't use it.
<Razyn> Makes sense
<drf-Droid> that and people confusing this channel with #RP
<Ray||bath> 02NO WAY
<Manlyguy> So in other words.
<Manlyguy> Ray.
<drf-Droid> everytime people 'stab' each other etc
<Dashite> On lower difficulties I preferred melee only runs to running off on my own.
<Manlyguy> gtfolmfao
<Armads> I mainly don't like this place for the script spam lol
<NewDCD> 9there
<Ray||bath> 02D:
<Dashite> Hey! There we go!
<NewDCD> 9video finally fixed
<Manlyguy> p:
<Ray> 02now'll brb
<Ray> 02¬¬
<Armads> there needs to be a channel exclusively for that.
<Manlyguy> XD
<Ray> 02#TMI?
<Ray> 02XD
<Armads> no, for script spam lol
<prince-dari> Armads: I thought there was? If you're talking about script spam.
<Armads> oh
<Ray> 02#ircgames
<Armads> well good
<drf-Droid> we have one
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Armads> so why is it still in here :(
<drf-Droid> because sometimes the chat goes dead?
<prince-dari> Because mods can still spam it here.
<prince-dari> :P
<Armads> eh, fair enough lol
<drf-Droid> not really
<prince-dari> Oh, so spamming scripts are fine when chat is dead.
<Armads> just bugs me when people !_____ instead of actually talking.
<drf-Droid> 10 second trigger limit
<Dashite> Grab the tech with the extra melee damage and the glove that dealt extra melee damage as well. One shots all the little guys.
<drf-Droid> regardless of mod status.
<prince-dari> But talking about MLP when chat is dead. EENOPE.
<prince-dari> is fine*
<drf-Droid> I never said *spamming* scripts
<drf-Droid> not my fault that !pokemon spreads like the plague
<Armads> actually it is
<Armads> it's all your fault drf
<Armads> you monster.
<Nittany_Tiger> Zed time annoys me.
<drf-Droid> k.
<drf-Droid> see
<Nittany_Tiger> They should make it something activeatable, not random.
<Manlyguy> So who here likes to do when where there is after?
<drf-Droid> as much as I may be disagreeable, can anybody disagree that I keep the channel alive? :P
<Dashite> Yeah. Random bullet time is so annoying.
<drf-Droid> and o.O @ that line
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I think the channel will abound more without you. :P
<Quanyails> 7Or at least, have more productive discussions.
<Armads> even though it's with rage half the time, that's true lol
<drf-Droid> >IRC
<drf-Droid> >productive
<drf-Droid> what is this I don't even
<Armads> lolol
<Armads> pretty sure those are the thesaurus under "antonyms"
<Dashite> Dammit, I'm at 6/7 for hard campaign.
<drf-Droid> yep
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup :p
<drf-Droid> they are
<Quanyails> 7Yeesh.
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF and I create tons of discussions
<HyperMetalLugia> Hurp
<drf-Droid> ^
<Quanyails> 7Good for you.
<prince-dari> MFW I've used IRC productively a lot
<drf-Droid> well
<Armads> drf talks a lot, obviously
<drf-Droid> the only server I've known to ever be productive is freenode
<Armads> just half the time people rage at what he says
<drf-Droid> yeah, people take everything seriously
<Armads> myself included lol
<drf-Droid> rule #1, don't take me seriously
<Armads> then I remember I don't give a damn
<Armads> :D
<drf-Droid> unless I say otherwise
<Quanyails> 7Sorry we don't appreciate your jokes.
*Armads shot
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<drf-Droid> Quany, s/we/you?
<NewDCD> 9medical studies about how the brain percieves time during stress/fear
<Quanyails> 7s?
<drf-Droid> yes
<prince-dari> substitute?
<drf-Droid> ^
<NewDCD> 9determined it can be somewhat random at times
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<drf-Droid> s/a/b, replace a with b
<NewDCD> 9Zed time is, ironically, somewhat realistic
<Quanyails> 7Eh, you've probably figured from how many arguments you supposedly cause.
<Armads> now that's some lazy markup. lol
<Armads> Armads finds it easier to just type sentences honestly XD;
<drf-Droid> so do I but I'm on a phone.
<Armads> oh right
<Armads> that thing.
<Armads> lol
<drf-Droid> it takes longer to type
<drf-Droid> EW TXTSPK, but s/a/b is actually pretty well known.
<drf-Droid> also
<Armads> not by me lol :(
<Armads> I just kinda figured it out.
<drf-Droid> I find it funny how many other people use 'Ew', but I'm the only one who gets raged at
<drf-Droid> yay bias?
<Armads> EW BIAS
<drf-Droid> ^
<drf-Droid> I mean hey, you can't please everybody.
<prince-dari> EW EW x
*Armads Editor's note: Armads is the most biased person he knows
<Manlyguy> I'm actually just annoyed by it universally. Ugly word, lol.
<Nittany_Tiger> I liked the Christmas update. I hope Tripwire does that again this year.
<prince-dari> It's more like eugh in the UK anyway.
<drf-Droid> some people may get mad at me on occasion, but I think overall I bring conversation
<drf-Droid> Manlyguy, what other word would you use to describe something gross
<Armads> no
<Armads> conversation is not allowed here
<Armads> gtfo
<drf-Droid> :(
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Manlyguy> Me?
<drf-Droid> yes you
<Manlyguy> I'd just keep my mouth shut about it. lol
<drf-Droid> orly?
<Manlyguy> Yeah.
<Manlyguy> Kinda like I'm not doing right now.
<drf-Droid> so whay would you say if a big slimy bug started crawling all over you
<Armads> lol
<drf-Droid> or something you dislike
<Armads> XD
<prince-dari> I'd eat it.
<Armads> knowing manly
<Armads> he'd probably just look at it
<Armads> and it'd burst into flames.

<Armads> rofl
<Armads> when I see something weird, whether it's on me or not
<Armads> I always go "the hell?"
<Armads> One time I thought I had six fingers on my right hand
<Manlyguy> I can imagine how your mornings are, Armads. lmfao
<Armads> and I went "the hell?"
<Armads> lol, you probably can :P
<drf-Droid> still, most people I know use the word ew in some way or another
<Armads> *wakes up and sees clock on 7:15 even though he set the alarm for 6:00*
<Armads> "the hell?"
<Quanyails> 7Well, Feather, I've chosen the colors and stuff.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02drf stalks the chat as much as I stalk the cbox
<Quanyails> 7Seems a bit desaturated; would you like it saturated or desaturated?
<drf-Droid> you mean spambox
<drf-Droid> but sure xD
<drf-Droid> though
<drf-Droid> doesn't stalking usually imply not talking?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If people spammed there, but it's not really that bad as last year
<Dashite> That was annoying.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No lol
<prince-dari> Lurking does.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Just that you're here almost all the time
<Dashite> My internet cut out.

<Roara|Plush> 6but I'm glad they mentioned keeping pokemon supported on normal DS systems
<Quanyails> 7But not in the hammerspace pocket. :P
<NewDCD> 9how about DAT COMIC-CON Poster?
<Roara|Plush> 6not just 3DS

<prince-dari> XD
<Armads> :P
<Chimera> 04huh
<Roara|Plush> 6but it wouldn't be surprising if-

<Roara|Plush> 6ARE YOU ALL
<HyperMetalLugia> O.,o
<Roara|Plush> 6READING MY MIND
<Stormy> we did add food coloring
<Chimera> 04XD
<Roara|Plush> 6AND SAYING STUFF FIRST
<Roara|Plush> 6:<
<prince-dari> Your brother - scared to watch ponies - fighting over who ices cupcakes.
<Chimera> 04:3

<prince-dari> Interesting.
<Chimera> 04Cuz we like that Roara :3~
<drf-Droid> because we're pros
<Chimera> 04ahaha Fatismu
<Armads> your mind is all over the road signs around here roara :(
*Quanyails 7wonders if this is TF2 canon. O_o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I want my RSE remakes :<
<Stormy> we put pink food coloring in, but it wasn't enough because they kind of turned peach instead of pink
<Armads> saying stuff like "Speed Limit 45"
<Chimera> 04That magazine announces things before anything all the time
<Lambda> aww
<drf-Droid> well, Roara. I can ask bluesun for more info
<prince-dari> Pinkie Pie cupcakes?
<drf-Droid> he knows Japanese and reads those sorts of magazins
<Chimera> 04Like Sonic Generations' confirmation of Chemical Plant and Stardust Speedway (\o/)
<Stormy> so we just added other random colors in each one and now they have colorful explosions
<drf-Droid> +e
<Stormy> lol, yeah :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And they seriously need to bring back the Pokeradar
<HyperMetalLugia> STARDUST
<HyperMetalLugia> Yues
<drf-Droid> LOLchaining
<Chimera> 04YES
<Roara|Plush> 6I don't want RSE remakes
<drf-Droid> I do
<Stormy> only they're frosted with chocolate because that's all we had
<Chimera> 04IT'S CONFIRMED
<Roara|Plush> 6RSE was perfect as it was
<Armads> what they need to bring back are antivitamins.
<Chimera> 04DRF you liked RSE?
<drf-Droid> RSE were the best games ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Any music
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Chimera> 04Hahahaha
<drf-Droid> chimera read what I just said
<Lambda> hmmm
<Stormy> So not quite Pinkie Pie cupcakes
<Chimera> 04I know MANY people who disagree drf
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02RSE was a great series.
<Chimera> 04[21:05:37] <Chimera> 04DRF you liked RSE?
<Chimera> 04[21:05:39] <%drf-Droid> RSE were the best games ever
<Chimera> 04I did
<Roara|Plush> 6RSE was amazing
<drf-Droid> Emerald is my all time favorite Pokémon game
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here XD
<drf-Droid> then it all started going downhill.
*Lambda tries to think of a peach pony with brown hair

<Roara|Plush> 6hurr
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:P
<Quanyails> 7Eh, can't really state much about it other than nostalgia.
<drf-Droid> was no running inside a la DP
<Chimera> 04Storyline killed it for most people Roara

<Roara|Plush> 6ok well that was stupid
<drf-Droid> it did
<drf-Droid> hence "a la DP"
<Chimera> 04It was an excuse
<Roara|Plush> 6but the overall awakening of legendary pokemon, them duking it out and you have to summon rayquaza to stop it
<Roara|Plush> 6that's cool
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lol
<drf-Droid> and eh, I don't remember the story of emerald
<drf-Droid> just that it was awesome
<Chimera> 04To let the stories coencide
<Roara|Plush> 6I just sumarized it lol
<drf-Droid> EVERYTHING ALL IN ONE PLACE YEAH
<Chimera> 04Emerald fixed that
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It was the same thing except it was more neutral
<Chimera> 04Roara that's Emerald not RS
<drf-Droid> except battle pike or w/e, that was dumb
*Quanyails 7meeps.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And you had to wake up Rayquaza to stop the two titans from fighting
<Chimera> 04Pike was cool
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Rora? You know ComicCon?

<HyperMetalLugia> LOLOL
<Roara|Plush> 6the one thing I hated about emerald was the call feature being brought back
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Chimera> 04This was when I had no grasp of hardware
<drf-Droid> Chimera, and broke your DS?
*drf-Droid hides

<Quanyails> 7At least, Armads, you're not trying to push some other action.
<HyperMetalLugia> =Wtf XD
<drf-Droid> Quany, I don't push actions either. people just assume.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, did your internet ban get lifted then Stormy?
<Quanyails> 7No, you insinuate.
<Armads> bidoof is strictly cooler than rayquaza and anyone who thinks otherwise is an ignorant twit
<Armads> ~
*Armads runs
<drf-Droid> that means people assume.
<Ray> 02I agree
<drf-Droid> and that's on them, not me.
<drf-Droid> LOL, Bidoof is useful as an HM slave
<Ray> 02with Armads.
<desertman2> It teleported!
<Quanyails> 7Again, I will deal with you later.
<Armads> bidoof is strictly inferior to Sunkern and anyone who thinks otherwise is an ignorant twit.
<drf-Droid> define 'deal with'
<Quanyails> 7I'm reading up on the new update elsewhere.
<Nittany_Tiger> He regenerates health.
<drf-Droid> LOL Sunkern is so random
<Stormy> well, kind of
<Ray> 02The one who beats the E4 with a bibdoof is a PRO. Nothing else
<Stormy> the internet wasn't working and I tried resetting the router
<drf-Droid> Ray
<Armads> nah, I'd say power to the man who beats 'em with a sunkern.
<Stormy> turns out I restored it to factory defaults
<Armads> 'cause you know
<Ray> 02bidoof*
<Armads> strictly superior
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Armads> etc
<Lambda> :P
<drf-Droid> do you know about the glitch that let's you WALK to the hall of fame?
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I know
<NewDCD> 9still a dick
<drf-Droid> so you can have only a level 1 bidoof
<drf-Droid> and profit
<Armads> lolol
<Ray> 02LOL.
<drf-Droid> only works in Japanese games.
<Stormy> My dad either forgot or just never bothered to put the blocks back on
<drf-Droid> or English ones with an AR.
<Lambda> either way
<Lambda> Yay!
<Stormy> But he thought the router had been hacked, XD
<Armads> I wanna make it to the hall of fame with a team of unown
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<Armads> spelling "L O L F A I"
<drf-Droid> XD
<prince-dari> Did he suspect Lambda?
<drf-Droid> not ARMADS?
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> I sure hope not
<drf-Droid> ...arm ads. creepy.
<Armads> already done that
<Armads> :d
<Nittany_Tiger> Shouldn't have trapped him in the room. Left you all nowhere to run in a failure situation.
*Armads shot
<prince-dari> Lambda be in your router.
<NewDCD> 9that strategy tends to work though
<drf-Droid> LOL
<NewDCD> 9when we got a bunch of pipe bombs, that is
<Lambda> im in ur router, haxxing ur internets
<Stormy> No :P
<desertman2> For TF2, why are they giving the soldier even more weapons?
<Nittany_Tiger> That's true.
<prince-dari> XD
<NewDCD> 9because Valve hates the Engineer
<Stormy> But I ended up telling him it was me
<Lambda> YOU haxxed it?!
<Lambda> jk
<Stormy> He's been paranoid about being "hacked" lately
<Lambda> :P
<Ghosties> 4GHOSTIES HAS RETURNED
<desertman2> and 4 secs of disabling buildings will make it OP
<Stormy> LOL @ the video Lambda
<Lambda> :P I sure liked it
<Ghosties> 4How did you guys like Killing Floor?
<Armads> I have so much crap around my desk.
<Lambda> I noticed what you meant by voldemort screaming the same scream like 5 times with this one
<NewDCD> 9Ghosties we gotta retry this shit
<Armads> as things are right now
<Armads> I can't move my chair
<Armads> XD
<Ghosties> 4I'm worn out
<prince-dari> You guys got raped by the last guy.
<Lambda> I posted my favorite pony trailers in pony spam, ignoring 36's trolling
<Ghosties> 4And I'm tired of playing on Abusement Park
<Lambda> that's my new strategy
<NewDCD> 9ah well
<Lambda> pretend he isn't there
<NewDCD> 9think I'll stop streaming now
<Stormy> He's still trolling?
<Ghosties> 4I honestly didn't think Normal was gonna be that fucking terrible
<Stormy> wow
<prince-dari> I like Ontels' posts.
<prince-dari> Just "spam".
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Lambda> he said I HATE PONIES like 50 times
<NewDCD> 9don't really got anything else to stream
<NewDCD> 9hey wait
<NewDCD> 9maybe I could try L4D for once
<Lambda> Ontels's strike me as whining
<NewDCD> 9a sec
*drf-Droid rages
<drf-Droid> I hate calculus
<Lambda> whining about being told off for being too mean
<Ghosties> 4Me, Soi, Derp, and a close friend have triumped on a Normal long game before...don't know why he's so goddamn impenetrable at the Abusement Park

<Stormy> it really is
<drf-Droid> ^ twss
<Stormy> I find myself getting annoyed every time I check on it
<NewDCD> 9I somehow got the achievement on hard
<NewDCD> 9probably due to the guys being with me being beast
<Ghosties> 4Probably
<Nittany_Tiger> What achievement?
<Ghosties> 4Were you playing with Soi and Derp?
<Ghosties> 4Dog and a Pony Show, Nittany
<drf-Droid> LOL, the kid next to me is watching some sort of anime on his Droid
<NewDCD> 9Dog and Pony Show is for Hard, though

<HyperMetalLugia> But Junh, we all know DRF can't hear anime names
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Stormy> 36 falls into both categories
<junh1024-XD> do it, maggot.
<Ghosties> 4And then you can get Mr. Foster
<Stormy> as does ontels
*junh1024-XD hides
<drf-Droid> why
<Lambda> Haha, yeah he does
<junh1024-XD> wynaut
*Armads rimshot
<Stormy> I used to not mind ontels
<Stormy> he watches me on dA and used to comment on my stuff sometimes
<Lambda> I swear dari and Mikey are the only people on there under the age of 18 who aren't super annoying
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh u

<Dashite> Such a small list of game. :(
<HyperMetalLugia> Spam time >:3
<drf-Droid> is that a script now?
<Razyn> Steam sound always creeped me out.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes :|
<prince-dari> Ontels' sole purpose there seems to be to try and troll and spam.
<HyperMetalLugia> And they complain about script spam lol
<junh1024-XD> skull make the pic
<drf-Droid> may I suggest hotlinking
<drf-Droid> at like
<drf-Droid> imgur
<drf-Droid> as EW ADS
<junh1024-XD> It's from Hansaku Iroha
<drf-Droid> yes I block them, others don't
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate how Steam games hate streaming when you play them full screen.
*Glacymr gives drf a cookie
<desertman2> I don't see anything
<junh1024-XD> some people cannot access imgur and cbf
*drf-Droid clears his cookies

<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder why
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<Ghosties> 4There we go

<drf-Droid> or I can host.
<Nittany_Tiger> Panama University Student Services.

<Ghosties> 4Sooooo?
<Ghosties> 4DCD?
<NewDCD> 9X means not uploaded yet
<NewDCD> 9but I know the grade
<NewDCD> 9passed.
<NewDCD> 9got A on the X

<NewDCD> 9no need to make any rehabilitation exams
<Razyn> What's quimicia?
<NewDCD> 9joy, joy
<Dashite> AAABCC
<Nittany_Tiger> Quimica significa Chemistry in espanol?
<drf-Droid> :/
<NewDCD> 9mom will get pissed when she finds out I got a C on Biology, though
<NewDCD> 9eyup
<drf-Droid> when LL texts me "Done x.x", that's usually not a good sign
<HyperMetalLugia> Aw
<Ghosties> 4DCD, what's General English like?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hard working :<
<prince-dari> How many can you name?
<Nittany_Tiger> Fisico Mathematica = Statistics?
<Soarin> what are you studying?
<Lambda> far fewer than you, I'm sure
<NewDCD> 9it's witnessing the rambles and tantrums of a woman who doesn't know shit of english
<Lambda> :P
<NewDCD> 9I could impart a better class
<Nittany_Tiger> No wait. Physical Mathematics.
<Dashite> lol
<Ghosties> 4Neato
<NewDCD> 9Soarin: Doctor in Medicine
<NewDCD> 9yeah Nittany, that
<Soarin> wow, neat
<NewDCD> 9next semester it gets a bit more...medical
<Nittany_Tiger> What's in that?
<NewDCD> 9this was my second semester
<Dashite> Physical Mathematics?
<Soarin> I want to study biology, already applied for winter semester
<Ghosties> 4Dude, I know a game we could try to play sometime. Dead Island when it comes out
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Lambda> Haha, look at Steven Magnet
<Lambda> hey, you should rename Steve that
<Ghosties> 4Then again, that's assuming I'd pay $50 for it and my 2010 laptop can run it : /
<Nittany_Tiger> Dead Island is one of the very few new games I'm interested in.
<Razyn> Well, you /are/ pretty good with Ingles. Don't see why you couldn't teach a pretty decent class.
*Razyn doesn't know why he just typed Ingles
<drf-Droid> oh god
<Ghosties> 4INGLES
<Soarin> dat ingles
<HyperMetalLugia> What is it now
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> It's actually ingle's.
<Ghosties> 4If you pronounce it as is, it really does sound funny
<drf-Droid> "when it comes time to figure out dominance" <-- SUGGESTIVE CALCULUS
<Nittany_Tiger> This keyboard doesn't do accented vowels.
<Ghosties> 4Like "engulls"
<HyperMetalLugia> What an odd class :P
<Dashite> Dem angles.
<junh1024-XD> terms, ae?
<Ghosties> 4Almost like Tingle from Zelda
<drf-Droid> yeah
<Ghosties> 4But minus the "t"
<Nittany_Tiger> I could never pronounce rr properly.
<Razyn> I always fucked up the ~'s
<prince-dari> LOL
<Ghosties> 4Can't roll your tongue?
<Razyn> and '
<drf-Droid> I prefer a > b, but I suppose "a dominates b" just sounds hot ;o
<Nittany_Tiger> Nope.
*drf-Droid hides
<prince-dari> YES. That's a great idea Lambda. XD
<Ghosties> 4Don't feel too bad, I can't either ._.
<junh1024-XD> you badass
<Lambda> Yay!

<Lambda> Yes
<Lambda> Yes you do

<SoiPony> damn patty
<Nittany_Tiger> Have you tried the Helm's Deep L4D2 stage?
<Ghosties> 4Fucking Patriarch
<Razyn> Hola!

<desertman2> Never played L4D
<Lambda> "My mooooostache welcomes you!"

<Lambda> There
<Ghosties> 4He can't sneak up on us and has to come to us in the front
<prince-dari> Woah.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<ClockworkPie> The best way to kill him is to corner him.
<Nittany_Tiger> But you have little room to get away from him.
<SoiPony> true
<Ghosties> 4The best method I know is for everyone to just suddenly blast him
<Ghosties> 4With everything
<SoiPony> we didn't have time to look for a better spot
<ClockworkPie> if he takes a knee then he will die
<Ghosties> 4Oh, and I fucking loved Resident Evil Outbreak <3
<Ghosties> 4We got Patty on one knee, though
<Ghosties> 4But he came back
<Ghosties> 4Recuperated
<Nittany_Tiger> I think I have that movie sitting in my living room unwatched.
<Armads> you are more insane than I am drf
<ClockworkPie> the door was left unguarded so he left to heal
<Ghosties> 4Cowardly Patty
<Armads> math puns
<Dashite> This map has a really long intro...
<Armads> are the first sine of madness
<ClockworkPie> indeed
<junh1024-XD> ahahahaha
<Ghosties> 4That's how it was in the original RE OUtbreak
<Dashite> GET ON WITH IT!
*Dashite has never played a RE game
<Ghosties> 4It takes about 3 minutes to finish
<Ghosties> 4:O
<HyperMetalLugia> lolol
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ghosties> 4Really, Dashite?
*Razyn hasn't either
<Ghosties> 4Wha
<Ghosties> 4The hell is wrong with this chatroom tonight >: (
<Dashite> I don't count playing like 5 minutes of 1 and 4 each.
<desertman2> RE2 is my favorite in the series
<Ghosties> 4PEELZ
<Razyn> Peelz. Peelz errywhere
<Ghosties> 4SO MANY PEELZ
<Ghosties> 4PEELZ
<Ghosties> 4PEELZ never changes
<Aponymous> I've played 4, 5 and Code Veronica.
<Nittany_Tiger> PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELZ
<Nittany_Tiger> I've played only 2.
<Dashite> They're fake. No way that guy would have died with that many peelz.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have 5 on my PC.
<Razyn> I like how every bottle was standing completely upright.
<Nittany_Tiger> Came free with my latest video card.
<desertman2> I've played all except 4 and 5
<Nittany_Tiger> Crysis came free with my last video card.
<Ghosties> 4I've played and owned Resident Evil, RE Director's Cut, RE2, RE3, RE4, RE Code Veronica, OUtbreak, Outbreak File #2
<Nittany_Tiger> And that card couldn't run it full-blast.
<prince-dari> I remember there was this log cabin joke.
<NewDCD> 9BRB
<NewDCD> 9mom being annoying
<SoiPony> aww
<Ghosties> 4I've beaten RE5, but refuse to buy it
<Dashite> Survival horror isn't really my thing and I was never really big into consoles so I haven't played a lot of games.
<drf-Droid> orly
<Razyn> TTFN DCD
<Ghosties> 4Oh, and Resident Evil Zero as well as the REmake for Gamecube
<Razyn> I never played RE because I used to hate FPS and I thought it was one. Still do.
<Soarin> I totally am Soarin
<Glacymr> 12drf has a steam account
<Soarin> daaren I mean
<Soarin> derp
<Glacymr> 12true or false
<Ghosties> 4But it's not an FPS, Razyn
<SoiPony> lol
<drf-Droid> true
<Glacymr> 12true
<Glacymr> 12:)
<Nittany_Tiger> RE isn't an FPS.
<SoiPony> bridging the gap between two chats I see Soarin
<Glacymr> 12i just randomly plugged in drfsupercenter
<Glacymr> 12to see what happened XD
<prince-dari> Ah, this is it.
<Soarin> so many chats, so many names
<Soarin> makes me confuss
<prince-dari> What's the integral of (1/cabin)d(cabin)?
<SoiPony> lol
<Glacymr> 12cabin fever o-o
<Razyn> Yeah... I'll just toss it into the pile of games I need to play along with MGS Golden Sun and most of the pre VII Final Fantasies.
<prince-dari> A natural log cabin.
<drf-Droid> oh
<Ghosties> 4A lot of the people that were playing in DCD's stream are in the chat now
<Armads> log(cabin)?
<drf-Droid> ln(cabin)
<Armads> ah lol
*drf-Droid hides
<Razyn> And others... So many games to play.
<Ghosties> 4AND YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED METAL GEAR SOLID
<Armads> I used to know how to do logarithms
<Armads> then I woke up.
<SoiPony> lol
<Dashite> >_>
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Ghosties> 4Time out for Razyun
<drf-Droid> bbl
<Ghosties> 4*Razyn
<Soarin> I only played MGS1
<Soarin> it was great though
<Ghosties> 4Never once played MGS...what kind of fucked up world do I live in *shaking head*
<Dashite> Yeah! I mean WTF Razyn?! Never played MGS?! *hasn't played it either*
<Aponymous> This reminds me, I still need to finish MGS3.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've played MGS1 - 4. Beat 1 - 3.
<Nittany_Tiger> I need to finish 4.
<Razyn> Well, I grew up on platformers, and kind of grew biased towards them in a sort immature way.
<Ghosties> 4Yes, Nittany, you do
<Ghosties> 4MGS4 was simply put, brilliant
<prince-dari> I've never played MGS.
<Soarin> I wanted to play 2 and 3, but by that time PCSX2 wasn't decent enough to play at anything above 10 fps
<Soarin> I should try it again
<Dashite> Hurray for Dari!
<Ghosties> 4Even if the majority of its detractors believe it's convoluted
<Razyn> I honestly just want to meet Ocelot. That's the only reason I'm considering playing MGS.
<Razyn> If the rest is cool too, so be it.
<Nittany_Tiger> A lot of people I know complain that it's more of a movie than a game (as in, cutscenes too long).
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, there is that
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't really care.
<Ghosties> 4A lot of people consider it like an interactive movie, and I also really don't care
<ClockworkPie> Fourth one had an hour long cutscene
<Ghosties> 4One of the biggest reasons I play MGS is for the story, and 4 doesn't fail to deliver
<ClockworkPie> I enjoyed every second of it
<Dashite> Hour long cutscenes... at what point does it stop being a game?
<Razyn> That actually doesn't sound half bad. I like story, which is why I attached a negative stigma to FPSs.
<SoiPony> when you play Heavy Rain
<SoiPony> that's no game...NO GAME
<Dashite> Is that possible?
<Dashite> I mean, playing Heavy Rain...
<Ghosties> 4What
<SoiPony> no
<Ghosties> 4Heavy Rain was a great game
<SoiPony> you simp[ly watch
<Ghosties> 4I still enjoyed it
<Nittany_Tiger> I've only played a demo of Heavy Rain. Would like to get it.
<SoiPony> and press x to jason
<Ghosties> 4Love the story
<Ghosties> 4Loved the characters too
<Razyn> how does one jason.
<Dashite> First you need to get an old school hockey mask.
<SoiPony> X
<SoiPony> X
<SoiPony> that's how
<Razyn> This sounds like something dirty.
<Razyn> X
<Dashite> O
<Razyn> =>
<Ghosties> 4But if Razyn or anyone else considers playing MGS4, you had better play through the other MGS titles first
<Ghosties> 4Or else you will not have the slightest inkling as to what is going on
<Razyn> I don't disrespect stories like that.
<Dashite> Δ
<desertman2> What about the MSX ones?
<Ghosties> 4It's advisable, but definitely not necessary. You get the backstory for those in MGS1
<Nittany_Tiger> I have those on a PS2 disk. Got stuck on #1
<Ghosties> 4Metal Gear 2 is SOOOO much better than Metal Gear 1
<Dashite> Hurray for youtube!
<Razyn> I'll most likely pick it up from the PSN.
<Razyn> Because PS Roms scare me.
<Ghosties> 4Is it on PSN?
<Ghosties> 4Metal Gear Solid, that is?
<Razyn> Eeyup.
<desertman2> I think so
<ClockworkPie> What happened to the stream?
<Ghosties> 4DCD says to let you guys know he can't stream anymore tonight. His mom wants to talk to him about his grade
<Aponymous> I just found The Essential Collection on Amazon.
<desertman2> DCD's not here
<Razyn> What happened to the /streamer/?
<Soarin> oh my
<Dashite> Oh hai. Alien swarm just finished. Wonder how far I can get solo.
<Aponymous> Damn
<Ghosties> 4But, Razyn, I definitely don't think you'll regret it. Metal Gear Solid is one of the very best experiences I've ever had playing a video game
<Ghosties> 4The story is phenomenal, the acting is tight, and the gameplay is a lot of fun too
<desertman2> Well, I'll go and try to get one of those new weapons in TF2
<Razyn> Nn... It might not topple FFIV, but I'm still trying it.
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, sorry guys. Look's like the stream's over tonight :(
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm one of those people that haven't played FF7.
<Ghosties> 4Still trying what, Razyn?
<Dashite> Haven't played a FF game at all here.
<Razyn> ...MGS.
<Nittany_Tiger> Same.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have FF12.
<Nittany_Tiger> Haven't touched it.
<Ghosties> 4Right, sorry, my mind derped for a moment >.<
<Soarin> you haven't missed much :p
<Nittany_Tiger> And it's a collector's edition.
<Ghosties> 4But great, glad you're gonna try it out
<Soarin> be one of the cool kids and play wrpgs instead
<Ghosties> 4I've played FFVII, VIII, VIX, X, and XII
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't play many RPGs. Up until now, I've been a FPS person.
<Ghosties> 4I've owned X and XII
<Razyn> IV is my favorite video game ever.
<Ghosties> 4And I tell you this, no of those games listed holds a candle to Final Fantasy X
<Nittany_Tiger> Now that FPS are steering from being SP games, I'm going towards something else.
<Ghosties> 4None of the FF I listed aside from X, that is
<Ghosties> 4SP as in single player, Nittany?
<Soarin> there's still bioshock and deus ex coming up
<Soarin> for good singleplayer fps games
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> I suck online.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't get into BF games because they're fucking difficult.
<Razyn> BF?
<Nittany_Tiger> Battlefield.
<Soarin> difficult? nah
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Razyn> Battlefield?
<Ghosties> 4Bioshock was a tremendous game, btw
<Soarin> just takes a while to learn how to not die in 2 seconds
<Nittany_Tiger> It was.
<Ghosties> 4Didn't care at all for Bioshock 2, though
<SoiPony> Bioshock 1 and 2 are briliant
<Soarin> bioshock 2 had the gameplay
<SoiPony> really?
<Nittany_Tiger> Soarin, I don't have the patience.
<SoiPony> I liked B2
<Ghosties> 4Really
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't kill shit on there.
<SoiPony> huh lol
<Soarin> while bioshock 1 had more story and development
<Ghosties> 4I HATED the tunnelvision that went along with being a Big Daddy
<Nittany_Tiger> I can be a kick-ass medic, but it's no fun when you die 15 times per game.
<SoiPony> yeah
<Soarin> well, I'm kinda looking forward to bf3
<SoiPony> DX 11 all the way
<Soarin> since it's supposed to be more realistic
<Ghosties> 4And that's right, Bioshock 1 had the story
<Soarin> than certain other shooters
<Nittany_Tiger> And no matter how many bullets I throw at the enemy, I end up dying.
<Ghosties> 4That's what I mostly cared about
<Ghosties> 4And Andrew Ryan was a great character
<Soarin> bioshock infinte is really shaping up excellent
<Nittany_Tiger> And I end up feeling like a drag on the team. There's just so many things that make me frustrated in BF.
<Soarin> the whole setting is so interesting
<SoiPony> I dunno what you're talking about...the Call of Duty series has the best storylines :p
<Nittany_Tiger> BF2 left a permanent bad taste in my mouth.
<Ghosties> 4As was Atlas, even though I think Fontaine was a fairly interesting character as well
<Nittany_Tiger> CoD used to be great.
<SoiPony> USED to
<Nittany_Tiger> Now it's just a whore w/ Bobby Kotick being the pimp.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't stand him.
<SoiPony> amen brony
<Nittany_Tiger> He's ruining the gaming industry.
<Ghosties> 4A lot of people don't like Kotick
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
*Razyn doesn't know who Kotick is
<Ghosties> 4He's viewed as the gaming industry's devil
<SoiPony> yep
<SoiPony> aka Activision's CEO
<Soarin> He's the big jew on top of Activision Razyn
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to get people together to protest AAA games in order to cut sales because I hate the AAA gaming industry.
<Nittany_Tiger> Kotick is evil.
<Ghosties> 4Used to be that EA was the Evil Empire, but most people have turned their sights to Kotick and Activision
<Nittany_Tiger> He openly admits it.
<Nittany_Tiger> He openly admits to milking his customers.
<Soarin> EA got a lot better lately
<Nittany_Tiger> And taking the fun out of making games.
<SoiPony> EA is still bad, but Acti is evil
<Nittany_Tiger> No, EA is getting worse again.
<Soarin> yeah the origin thing
<Nittany_Tiger> That.
<Soarin> is pretty bullshit
<Ghosties> 4Definitely
<SoiPony> mhm
<Ghosties> 4After Dragon Age II, EA is looking pretty shitty once again
<Soarin> Dragon Age is bioware
<Ghosties> 4And it's not the actual game that I blame either, it's EA's customer support
<Nittany_Tiger> They banned two people from playing DA 2 because of things they said on a forum.
<Ghosties> 4Exactly
<Soarin> EA is only publishing it if anything
<Nittany_Tiger> EA is a terrible publisher.
<Ghosties> 4But EA was the one that pushed Bioware to finish
<Nittany_Tiger> All they want is to control your games even after sale.
<Ghosties> 4They were forcing Bioware to release as quickly as possible

<Nittany_Tiger> And then they championed something I hate: Online Passes.
<Soarin> that doesn't change anything, Bioware is responsible for shitty design choices
<Ghosties> 4So we basically got an unfinished game
<Light_Latias> 12hot out ><;
<Light_Latias> 12VERY so
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
*HyperMetalLugia ices
<Ghosties> 4They didn't have enough time to work everything out though
<Nittany_Tiger> No. EA is responsible for rushing games out to meet deadlines.
<HyperMetalLugia> Are you sure it isn't something else
<Ghosties> 4To be honest, Bethesda is kinda feeling the burn too
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision is the same.
*Light_Latias 12holds ice against every inch of her body ><;
<Ghosties> 4After Brink, and the shit fest that game turned out to be
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Light_Latias> 12it prolly is something else too :/
<Quanyails> 7I'm getting very close to my limit for DRF.
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww
<Light_Latias> 12hmm?
<Light_Latias> 12what'd he do this time? o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> All AAA publishers are becoming the same: putting profit above the love of the art.
<Quanyails> 7Upset more people.
<Ghosties> 4Of course
<Quanyails> 7As usual.
<Dashite> EA has awesome customer support.
<Nittany_Tiger> And I know a lot of gamers know that.
<HyperMetalLugia> How?
<Ghosties> 4What, Dashite?
<Nittany_Tiger> But no-one's doing anything about it.
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Ghosties> 4You're joking
<Ghosties> 4Right?
<Nittany_Tiger> Except I've tried.
<Dashite> Nope. Every time I've had to call them, I've gotten my issues solves in 10 minutes of less with no hassle.
<Quanyails> 7You know, his dissuasion of certain tools and implication toward his preferences.
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Nittany_Tiger> But you know XBL kids won't listen to "That guy that makes CoD is stealing your parent's money."
<Ghosties> 4Don't ever complain about their game...EVER
<Soarin> people actually call instead of use google? ;)
<Ghosties> 4Or else they'll lock you out of it
<Light_Latias> 12in other words, same-old same-old :/
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Light_Latias> 12well
<Nittany_Tiger> Things are terrible when publishers can lock you out of your own games.
<Light_Latias> 12good news for you all
<Light_Latias> 12if he's de-Opped
<Ghosties> 4Yep yep
<Quanyails> 7He will be, I'll make sure.
<Light_Latias> 12he's going to leave TST permanently
<Nittany_Tiger> Valve could do it if they feel like it, but they have a heart.
<Razyn> I've never used customer support. Even when I was like seven, it just sounded so... Archaic.
<Light_Latias> 12then he's as good as gone
<Quanyails> 7Good for the rest of us.
<HyperMetalLugia> Orly nao
<Nittany_Tiger> Verizon has the worst customer support ever. They tried to automate everything.
<Ghosties> 4It's an abhorrent practice: If you publicly badmouth a game, the publisher will lock you out of playing it again
<Nittany_Tiger> And if you do get a person, they can be rude as hell.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> I really want to get verbal protests together.
<HyperMetalLugia> We need to throw a 'Goodbye DRF' party then
<Light_Latias> 12I wish I could sympathize with him but he brought it upon himself v.v
<Razyn> What exactly does a lock entail? You own it, you should be able to play it.
*Light_Latias 12slaps Hyper
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Ghosties> 4Valve may have a heart, but DAT GABE NEWELL
*HyperMetalLugia faints
<Nittany_Tiger> Not according to EA Razyn
<Nittany_Tiger> Sony still owns your PS3.
<Nittany_Tiger> Microsoft still owns your Xbox.
<Ghosties> 4If they lock you out, you can't access your saved files and you can't play the game
<Razyn> What, I can't use online? I don't get it.
<Razyn> What.
<Razyn> How.
<Nittany_Tiger> When you buy EA games, you have to tie them to a central account.
<Nittany_Tiger> With an EULA
<Ghosties> 4It's DRM
<Ghosties> 4Which means that they can take away the game from you at anytime
<Nittany_Tiger> And if you break that, they can terminate your account.
<Ghosties> 4Digital Rights Media, basically
<Ghosties> 4All their top games are like that now
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<nickstr> wow RDS FAIL
<prince-dari> [03:07] <Nittany_Tiger> Sony still owns your PS3.
<prince-dari> MFW they don't
<nickstr> Pokmon What Happened To You
<prince-dari> They claimed to.
<nickstr> the accented e is an illegal character in RDS
<prince-dari> Not validated by law at the moment I'm fairly sure.
*Glacymr keeps his subway sandwich away from nickstr
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, they told everyone they couldn't have Linux.
<Nittany_Tiger> And they took it away.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hiya LL
<prince-dari> Yet people have linux anyway.
<Nittany_Tiger> And they could because of the EULA.
<Nittany_Tiger> Illegally.
<Light_Latias> 12hiyas Shiny~
<prince-dari> And they got sued multiple times when they did it.
<nickstr> not only that my RDS reverted to what I had before on FM
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You should play with Manly and I
<Nittany_Tiger> Those lawsuits are still bouncing about.
*Razyn is actively searching for a game that could be taken away from him
<Light_Latias> 12if this keeps up, I'll have to join you as a Fire-type
<Light_Latias> 12hmm?
*Razyn in his library
<Nittany_Tiger> And Sony has enough money to win those lawsuits.
<Glacymr> 12join you as a fire-type?
<Glacymr> 12what
<prince-dari> Money doesn't help you win.
<Light_Latias> 12nvm
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:P
<prince-dari> Necessarily.
<Nittany_Tiger> EULAs do.
<Soarin> unless you do stupid stuff nothing gets taken from you
<Glacymr> 12what is this some sort of PMD MMO
<Light_Latias> 12how do you mean, Shiny?
*Quanyails 7hmms.
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless they break the law.
<Light_Latias> 12no Glacy o.o
<Light_Latias> 12and ._.
*Light_Latias 12shudders
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<Light_Latias> 12there was
<Light_Latias> 12a
*Quanyails 7talks to herself about her thinning patience and subsequent alteration of sentiments.
<Light_Latias> 12HUGE bug
<Ghosties> 4If you own Spore, that's DRM
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is what the lawsuits are trying to prove that Sony did with the Linux removal firmware.
<Light_Latias> 12under my shirt ><
<Glacymr> 12i saw a giant dragon fly earlier
<Glacymr> 12cool things
<Nittany_Tiger> Yay SecuROM.
<Light_Latias> 12at work
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Was it Vicky's bug of evil?
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't even know about SecuROM when I bought Spore.
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Glacymr> 12lol shiny
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Nittany_Tiger> Nor install limits.
<Light_Latias> 12it kinda looked like an oversized grasshopper
<Quanyails> 7I mentioned a giant cockroach-thingy a few days ago trapped in my window.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Cicada?
<Glacymr> 12praying mantis?
<prince-dari> Sony didn't even outright win the lawsuit on geohot.
<prince-dari> They just settled.
<Glacymr> 12i saw an earwig a couple days ago
<Glacymr> 12those things creep me out
<Nittany_Tiger> Geohot had to get money together to hire good enough lawyers to stay in the battle.
<Light_Latias> 12not a cicada
<Light_Latias> 12and Glacy
<Light_Latias> 12I HOPE it wasn't a praying mantis
<Nittany_Tiger> Geohot has also pissed many people off.
<prince-dari> He got 1000s in donations.
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<Glacymr> 12praying mantises are harmless
<Light_Latias> 12it kinda looked like it...
<Nittany_Tiger> He actually started everything.
<nickstr> its one of a couple bugs that don't make me nervous
<nickstr> I had one crawling on my arm before and it kind of tickled
<SilverSonic> LL!
<SilverSonic> Hai!
<prince-dari> I think anyone who is angry at geohot's an idiot.
<Glacymr> 12it's also one of the only animals that share the same type of vision with us lol
<Aeroslash> praying mantis's are cute :>
<Light_Latias> 12oh frak
*Light_Latias 12googled pics
<Nittany_Tiger> When he announced that he broke the PS3 hypervisor, lazy, anti-consumer Sony took away Linux.
<prince-dari> It's his PS3, he can do what he wants with it.
<Light_Latias> 12it looks JUST like it ._.
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate Sony for what they did.
<Light_Latias> 12and I killed it...
<Glacymr> 12we 3D color seeing animals need to stick out for eachother :)
<Aeroslash> awws
<Ghosties> 4I actually own Spore
<Nittany_Tiger> Taking away Linux when they could have patched the issue.
<Ghosties> 4And I knew about the DRM
<Glacymr> 12:<
<Light_Latias> 12nickstr
<Light_Latias> 12may I remind you
<Light_Latias> 12it was
<Light_Latias> 12IN my SHIRT
<Glacymr> 12in or on?
<SilverSonic> lol
<Light_Latias> 12IN
<Light_Latias> 12with an "I"
<Nittany_Tiger> Sony still continues to treat their customers like idiots.
*Light_Latias 12shudders
<Glacymr> 12i see the I
<Light_Latias> 12it felt...ew
<Glacymr> 12i know how you felt trust me
<Nittany_Tiger> They only got a little humble after being hacked.
<Light_Latias> 12crawling all over me
<Glacymr> 12one time i was in the back yard
<Glacymr> 12when i felt something bump the back of my leg
<Glacymr> 12i look and there is a huge freaking spider there
<Light_Latias> 12.______________________.
<Razyn> That's generally how you treat your cattle, isn't it?
<Glacymr> 12like as thick as my leg sitting there
<Light_Latias> 12Black Widow?
<Glacymr> 12no
<Glacymr> 12wolf spider i think
<Light_Latias> 12good
<Light_Latias> 12whoa .-.;
<Ghosties> 4As long as people put money in their hands, they're gonna continue doing it
<Aeroslash> scary!
<Nittany_Tiger> Except we're not cattle.
<Aeroslash> I almost bumped into a wolf spider nest before
<Glacymr> 12make matters worse
<Glacymr> 12i already had a fear of spiders
<Aeroslash> ikr?
<Light_Latias> 12oh fun
<Ghosties> 4Admittedly, I thought it was neat when Sony was like "WE'RE SORRY FOR BEING DOWN, HAVE FREE STUFF" and gave everybody about 6 or 7 games for free in total
<Light_Latias> 12arachnophobia
<Light_Latias> 12common
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Light_Latias> 12and something that large...
<Razyn> I look in the mirror, I see a man, X sees me they see a guy willing to give money for the next big shiny.
<Aeroslash> yup., I have it o.o
*Light_Latias 12shudders
<Armads> I think wolf spiders are relatively harmless
<Light_Latias> 12I have it to a point
<Armads> but still that would freak me the hell out rofl
<Light_Latias> 12it's size-related
<Aeroslash> very much so
<Aeroslash> little ones I can kill fine
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Aeroslash> big ones....o.o;;;;
<Light_Latias> 12Wolf-Spider sized...
<Dashite> Anyway, yes people do actually call customer support some times.
<Ghosties> 4Funny thing is, I bet most of Sony's consumers were mad at the hackers who knocked them down a peg
*Light_Latias 12shivers
<Aeroslash> and MN has huge spidahs D:
<Armads> I think the worst bug I've dealt with down here was
<Aeroslash> in the woods
<Armads> well this one time a lizard showed up in my room.
<Armads> that was kinda cool.
<prince-dari> I thought the hack was funny.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Aeroslash> coolio, I'd be like "awws, that's cute!"
<prince-dari> Even though my info got stolen.
<Glacymr> 12yeah Armads
*Light_Latias 12lols
<Armads> I took a buncha pictures lol
<Light_Latias> 12reminds me of when I vacationed to Disney
<Dashite> I called EA up once when the serial key was misprinted on one of their games. They gave me a new one.
<Light_Latias> 12there were
<Nittany_Tiger> Sony deserved the hack.
<Glacymr> 12wolf spiders, their venom might cause a little itching and swelling
<Light_Latias> 12MILLIONS of geckos
<Glacymr> 12but otherwords they are harmless
<Dashite> Took like 5 minutes.
<Aeroslash> CA or FL, LL?
<Razyn> mfw I have 32 cents from psn cards on my account
<Light_Latias> 12but none of them saved me 15% or more on car insurance ;-;
<Light_Latias> 12FL
<Aeroslash> ahh
<Armads> rofl :(
<Nittany_Tiger> They put a target on their back when they removed Linux.
<Armads> florida is where Armads lives
<Armads> and yeah there are geckos everywhere
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12the thing is though that it doesn't matter where you live
<Light_Latias> 12they're cute
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<Armads> I think the one that showed up in my room was one.
<prince-dari> Also when they sued about 50 people.
<Glacymr> 12you can always have a dangerous spider nearby
<Nittany_Tiger> Before they removed Linux, the PS3 was unhacked.
<Armads> to this day I don't know how it got in there
<Glacymr> 12if it's in it's natural habitat or if it hitch hiked a ride from elsewhere
<Razyn> What did Linux do, exactly?
<Nittany_Tiger> Big companies are stupid.
<Armads> brown recluses are scarier than black widows imo D:
<Armads> N E C R O S I S
*Quanyails 7hmms at this conversation.
<Glacymr> 12brazillian wondering spiders are more scary than both
<Nittany_Tiger> It was officially called "OtherOS." It was an option to install an alternate OS on the PS3. 99 times out of 100, it was Linux.
<Glacymr> 12*wandering
<Glacymr> 12sorry
<Light_Latias> 12necrosis?
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Armads> causes the flesh around the bite to decay.
<Nittany_Tiger> It provided people with a crappy but cheap computer.
<Armads> it's ugly to look at.
<Nittany_Tiger> Something a lot more open than the Xbox 360.
<Light_Latias> 12EW EW EW
<Light_Latias> 12I saw the images
<HyperMetalLugia> .noitasrevnoc siht ta smmh 6HyperMetalLugia
<Armads> will not post pics XD
<Light_Latias> 12can't unsee
<Light_Latias> 12><;
<Armads> lol
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of which, I'm surprised no one's taken Microsoft and Live down yet
*Light_Latias 12feels nauseas again...
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm surprised no-one's hacked Activision yet.
*HyperMetalLugia gives LL a bucket
<HyperMetalLugia> KFC Chicken Bucket
<Ghosties> 4It wouldn't matter if they did, Kotick wouldn't give a shit
<prince-dari> Microsoft probably look after Live much better.
<Razyn> So, a computer on your game console was... Good?
*Light_Latias 12o.o
<prince-dari> Since it's a paid service.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Glacymr> 12HyperMetalLugia
<Razyn> Sounds more like a novelty to me.
<Glacymr> 12nice try
*Glacymr poofs into a dolphin
<Light_Latias> 12eye c u dun liek KFC
<HyperMetalLugia> .,.
<Ghosties> 4As long as Kotick and Activision have CoD, they could care less about anyone else
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah, but it was something for some people that couldn't afford or didn't want a separate PC.
<HyperMetalLugia> I leik KFC
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<prince-dari> A fair number of people bought the PS3 because of otherOS.
<Dashite> Kotick also has WoW.
<Glacymr> 12KFC is amazing
<HyperMetalLugia> IT is the only fast food franchise around here
<Light_Latias> 12then why give some to a nauseas Lati?
<Daxton> anyone care about respawn entertainments new game?
<prince-dari> Could care less?
<HyperMetalLugia> Because you need food!~
<Glacymr> 12i'm just telling HML that talking about KFC while Light_Latias is suffering nausea
<Glacymr> 12isn't the best idea
<Ghosties> 4Oh, couldn't care less
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep. Could care less.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<prince-dari> Just confuses me when people say could care less. O_o
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Ghosties> 4That too, though. WoW is a big money maker for them
<Armads> lolol
<Light_Latias> 12I hope
<Nittany_Tiger> Only for Kotick.
<Light_Latias> 12that tomorrow night
<Armads> talking about KFC is generally not a good idea
*Armads runs
<Light_Latias> 12won't be as bad
<Nittany_Tiger> Not for the rest of Activision.
<Light_Latias> 12BL is sleeping over~
<Nittany_Tiger> And I don't think Kotick gives a shit about the rest of Activision.
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<Ghosties> 4I remember when Activision wasn't all that big in the late 90's - early 2000's
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Glacymr> 12Black Latias?
<HyperMetalLugia> Have fun
<Glacymr> 12*Latios
<Nittany_Tiger> It wasn't a big deal to me until I learned about his DICE speech in 2009.
*Light_Latias 12hopes to Arceus she doesn't make her watch The Human Centipede ><;
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Light_Latias> 12ayups
<Glacymr> 12wow
<Nittany_Tiger> I've hated and boycotted the company ever since.
<Glacymr> 12who would have known you two were so close
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You didn't know?
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Nittany_Tiger> And hoped that people had the brains to do the same.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<Glacymr> 12one day i know Shiny-Growlithe or SilverSonic is going to come looking for me
<Glacymr> 12i know it ;-;
<Light_Latias> 12Glacy, you're the last to realize :3
<Nittany_Tiger> Every November, I'm sadly disappointed.
<Light_Latias> 12we live in the same village
<Glacymr> 12i usually always am lol
<Razyn> I don't ever recall playing an Activision game. At least not at length.
<Glacymr> 12ahh
<Nittany_Tiger> And I liked CoD, too.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yup, just gotta finish tricking my mom to go to Pizza Doctors
<Light_Latias> 12about 10min walking distance
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12have you shown her the video?
<Dashite> War for Cybertron doesn't deserve to be boycotted.
<Light_Latias> 12?
*SilverSonic Now Playing: Nyan Cat (Official Instrumental)
<SilverSonic> XD
<Light_Latias> 12which video?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, I did
<Glacymr> 1210 minutes isn't too bad
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not giving that greedy bastard a cent.
<Glacymr> 12Light_Latias
<Light_Latias> 12oh
<Light_Latias> 12not@me
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll buy Acti games used if I want them.
<Glacymr> 12yes not at you
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's called Outrageous Foods, it was featuring a pizzaria in La Crosse
<Glacymr> 12maybe SilverSonic can be compelled as well to come to pizza doctors
<Glacymr> 12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulw1uJ9dPzg
<Nittany_Tiger> Surprisingly, Acti has so far not cared about second-hand sales.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'll be the person who's only ordering pepporoni pizza and the dessert pizza
<Glacymr> 12XD'
<Nittany_Tiger> All of the other publisher want to punish people who buy used games or (unintentionally) rent them.
<Glacymr> 12i'll be the person ordering extra spicy
<Glacymr> 12i'll probably suggest they get like habaneros or something
<Glacymr> 12and make a spicy beast
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And then I'll be giving you weird looks
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12i'll be offering you a slice
<Nittany_Tiger> I understand they're not making money, but the crap they're pulling is insane. No other industry does stuff like this.
<Nittany_Tiger> Controls your products post-sale.
<Razyn> This is the first I've heard of that.
<Nittany_Tiger> And tries to get their hand into the used market.
<Dashite> You think other industries wouldn't if they could?
<Ghosties> 4EA does it now
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I couldn't deal with spicy foods
<Ghosties> 4And Warner as well
<Nittany_Tiger> EA does it. THQ does it. Sony and Ubisoft are going to do it.
<Nittany_Tiger> Warner does it?
<Glacymr> 12i need spicy
<Glacymr> 12it's like my fuel
<Nittany_Tiger> How?
<Dashite> Ubisoft is much worse.
<Ghosties> 4If you bought a used copy of Mortal Kombat, you couldn't play online against people unless you bought an Online Pass
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02that's coffee for me
<Ghosties> 4They're following EA's path
<Dashite> Ubisoft had that damn online connection requirement.
<prince-dari> Sony's probably the worst company though.
<Ghosties> 4That's how they get you in used sales

<prince-dari> They put God damn rootkits o ntheir CDs.
<Nittany_Tiger> They dropped the always-on DRM.
<prince-dari> on*
<Nittany_Tiger> Sony created SecuROM.
<Nittany_Tiger> :>
<Ghosties> 4One good place online to get games is gog.com
<Razyn> So all of this control just affects online stuff?
<Ghosties> 4DRM free
<Light_Latias> 12hai Chime
<Dashite> Securom, still not as bad as Starforce.
<Glacymr> 12hi Chimera
<Icydragon> PORNY
<Nittany_Tiger> I heard that Starforce ruined CD drives.
<Cynder7> 6DAMMIT.
<Nittany_Tiger> I bought one game with Starforce.
<prince-dari> I don't think anyone else has done that.
<Daxton> i cant wait for the dreamcast 2
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm done with consoles.
<Icydragon> I'm never gonna let you live that down ;P
<Dashite> I was a regular on the Galactic Civilizations forum when Starforce devs decided to post links to GalCiv torrents in an argument about games without DRM.
<Icydragon> http://forum.darkspyro.net/spyro/viewposts.php?topic=40318&page=3

<prince-dari> Because Sony got sued left, right, and centre then too.

<prince-dari> Fail.
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, DRM is useless.
<Nittany_Tiger> The games still get cracked.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft's lasted a month.
<Dashite> And it probably had 90% of it's sales in the first 3 weeks.
<Glacymr> 12what you playing?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Dashite> Mission Accomplished.
<Cynder7> 6I SEE A PORNY PRANCIN'
<Nittany_Tiger> I heard that many people tried to take their copies back because they couldn't play their copies due to connection issues.
<Icydragon> I knew exactly how they'd react
<Dashite> For which game?
<SilverSonic> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Hotel_Mario.jpg LOL at this pic, I just noticed Mario's leg is in the wrong place
<Nittany_Tiger> I know that DRM is used to ensure high first-week sales.

<Nittany_Tiger> After they learned that they had a 90% piracy rate.

<prince-dari> Wow.
<Light_Latias> 12@Danny
<drf|laptop> 03yeah

<Icydragon> I know, but that's the spyro fandom for ya
<Nittany_Tiger> Indie games may suffer more from piracy.
<Dashite> Pay what you want. "Okay, 0.00 it is!"
<prince-dari> LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> I would condone it since I support indie developers.
<Nittany_Tiger> I think they have a lot more heart than AAA publishers.
<Dashite> "Uh guys... if you're gonna pay 0.00 anyway, could you please you a torrent instead of our official download servers. :/"
<Cynder7> 6This other person added elephants to their list but put a little heart next to them? :|

<Cynder7> 6D:
<Glacymr> 12not surprised
<Nittany_Tiger> But at least they're not stuck behind a AAA publisher who's going to force them on a schedule.
<HyperMetalLugia> A guy I saw had a angry birds shirt
<Glacymr> 12blah my neck still hurts a little
<prince-dari> What're you talking about?
<HyperMetalLugia> With the exact same text :|
<Icydragon> Hmm?
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if open protests could seriously happen against AAA publishers.
<prince-dari> Well anonymous organised one against Sony which was a fail.
<Cynder7> 6DREAM OF MIRRORS FTW
<Nittany_Tiger> Anon organized a hack attack.
<Razyn> I can't picture a protest working in this day and age.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm talking about verbal protests.
<prince-dari> They did Nittany_Tiger.
<prince-dari> They were DDoSing some of Sony's sites, then people complained at them that PSN was going down or something, so they stopped DDoSing.
<prince-dari> And organised protests outside Sony stores.
<Razyn> What's verbal protesting?
<Dashite> People actually go to Sony Stores?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Razyn> There are Sony stores?
<Icydragon> lovely
<Dashite> So they say.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure how successful it was, not very I'm thinking though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Like people picket-signing against AAA publishers.
<Nittany_Tiger> Petitions fail.

<Nittany_Tiger> Online boycotts fail.

<HyperMetalLugia> LOL time travel
<Nittany_Tiger> Needs to get organized or publishers will continue to greedily destroy gaming.
<Icydragon> Nothing danebo just likes selling out
<Razyn> What part of gaming is being destroyed, exactly?
<Nittany_Tiger> Ownership for one.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Razyn> Mhm.
<Icydragon> most of the "popular" youtubers do
<Nittany_Tiger> The "Pay for the game once and you own it. No other fees." It's going towards having to continuously pay to play games.
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> "A feature which even adults can enjoy, 'The Summer of Pokèmon, The Summer of Japan'. Along with the newest information ranging from the games to the movies, a special limited magazine-only 'password' for use in 'Super Pokèmon Scramble' is included! Unmissable for fans!"
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision wants to slide that in with CoD Elite.
<Dashite> Hello DLC!
<Razyn> Now stop right there.
<Razyn> I never have to do that.
<Nittany_Tiger> You will.
<Razyn> Is it just certain kinds of games?
<Razyn> When?
<Dashite> It hasn't expanded beyond MMOs yet.
<drf|laptop> 03> so no RSE remakes yet? :X
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> but that seems to be about the whole article rather than the specific 'o were making more games'
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> I'd guess not... or at least no RSE publicly announced
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not yet, but Activision will start it.
<Nittany_Tiger> Like I said, CoD: Elite is the beginning.
<prince-dari> It's going to start because companies get loads more money this way.
<Nittany_Tiger> Soon, all online play will require a subscription fee.
<prince-dari> I wouldn't say all.
<prince-dari> But a lot.
<Dashite> It's a good thing I mainly play single player!
<Dashite> >_>
<Razyn> Online. Well, now that I know we're playing in a different ballpark I can breathe easy.

<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a SP person as well.

<Nittany_Tiger> I used to play MP.

<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> for the 3DS game

<Dashite> I don't remember the last time I bought a used game that was still being sold in stores.
<Link> is this on a dif server?
<Nittany_Tiger> I buy more used now because of my limited income.
<drf|laptop> 03of course it is
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, I was robbed last December and have a gaming library to rebuild.

<Glacymr> 12;-;
<drf|laptop> 03?
<prince-dari> Pointless stuff is strangely fun.
<Dashite> I don't see the point in saving buying used to save $5 when I can wait a month and get it for $20 or more cheaper.
<Nittany_Tiger> I buy some used now to deny publishers I hate money.
<prince-dari> Quickscopes on MW2 were completely pointless, but once I'd played the game to death, they stayed fun for ages afterwards. INB4 CoD hate
<Glacymr> 12?
<Glacymr> 12maybe
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't hate CoD.
<Glacymr> 12people complain about the ownership script
<Glacymr> 12so i made it more unique
<drf|laptop> 03I'd just get rid of it if I were you
<Nittany_Tiger> And I can't aim, so quickscoping for me is out of the question.
<Dashite> Haven't bought a CoD game since 2.
<Glacymr> 12brings attention to myself
<Glacymr> 12so no 8D
<Nittany_Tiger> I bought 1, some derivatives for 1, 2, 4, and 6 (MW2).

<Aurora> um
<Nittany_Tiger> I play the SP and briefly touched the MP.
<prince-dari> Lolwut XD
<drf|laptop> 03the new game is supposedly going to have camera features and AR markers so it's hard to believe they wouldn't make it 3DS only
<Aurora> blue's stuff-
<Nittany_Tiger> I played MW2's MP and found limited enjoyment.

<Aurora> basically
<Light_Latias> 12ah
<Aurora> unless you can tell me otherwise
<Aurora> that victini is for the AR capabilities of the 3D pokedex
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, I was into Halo 3's MP a lot.
<Nittany_Tiger> But not deathmatch and stuff.
<drf|laptop> 03oh, yeah he said that was about the 3D Pokédex
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved custom matches and Infection.
<Nittany_Tiger> And Grifball.
<Aurora> and that is 3DS only
<Dashite> I can't play console FPS. :/
<eXAKR> lol 3DS
<Nittany_Tiger> I also played a lot of UT2K4.
<prince-dari> Well at least you don't rage at people who play console FPS.

<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> the 3D Pokedex?
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> that's what I was talking about
<drf|laptop> 03> yeah

<Dashite> :p
<Nittany_Tiger> I though I would be better at PC FPSs.
<Nittany_Tiger> But nope.
<Aurora> the interview about the new game came from famitsu
<Nittany_Tiger> At least online.
<prince-dari> Doing it wrong? Lawl. So you are a stuck up PC gamer. :P
<Aurora> not just serebii
<Aurora> http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Famitsu,_Pok%C3%A9mon_CEO_hint_at_%27surprise%27
<drf|laptop> 03you do realize that bulbagarden just pulls its information from other sites
<drf|laptop> 03so they probably got it from serebii's post
<Dashite> Pfft, console peasants. How's your sub-hd 30FPS games? :p
<drf|laptop> 03oh, but yeah. the magazine comes out tomorrow
<prince-dari> Nittany_Tiger: Most people have to invest quite a lot of time to get really good, and a lot of people value their time to much to do that, or don't have enough free time to do so.
<prince-dari> MFW it's HD.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm one that doesn't like to play a lot.
<prince-dari> And you won't notice the difference between 30 FPS and 500 FPS probably. :P
<Dashite> MFW it's upscaled
<prince-dari> MFW on PS3 it isn't, on Xbox it is.

<drf|laptop> 03bluesun said he'll translate the interview
<drf|laptop> 03I kind-of don't trust Serebii's translations
<Lambda> I would love to see this happen in season 2
<drf|laptop> 03they translated some of the soundtracks completely wrong to the point that it's embarrasing

<SilverSonic> Someone needs to update the topic
*Dashite has a PS3...
<SilverSonic> as NS isnt away anymore XD
<Nittany_Tiger> That's why I don't like XBL's fee. Inhibits people like me to try MPs out for free.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> That'd be great. XD
<Nittany_Tiger> I have a PS3 and 360.
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyway, I don't like paying a fee just to see if I like a game online or not.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll just buy it on PC.
<Nittany_Tiger> or PS3.
*Razyn has a PS3
<Nittany_Tiger> I hear a lot of XBL fanboys dis PSN.
<Nittany_Tiger> Especially when I complain about the fee.
<prince-dari> Meh, console wars are annoying.
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, I always thought that Microsoft could make /at least/ online gaming free.
<Nittany_Tiger> The rest can go die. I just want to play online a bit.
<Dashite> They could, but why would they?
<Nittany_Tiger> They won't.
<Nittany_Tiger> They hooked too many people into paying the fee when the Xbox came out.
<Nittany_Tiger> I thought console fees were bad back them because you could play online for free on PC.
*Ghosties 4doesn't have a PS3 :(
<Nittany_Tiger> Again, people don't think. They just buy.
<Dashite> Aww, poor ghosties.
*Nittany_Tiger has a launch model PS3.
<Nittany_Tiger> Not too cheap to get nowadays.
*Dashite is slim
<prince-dari> Ghosties: You're not missing out on much.
<prince-dari> Other than GT5.
<Nittany_Tiger> Launch models can play PS1 and PS2 games.
*Razyn has launch model 600 GB PS3
<Dashite> GT5? Meh.
<Dashite> :p
<prince-dari> Well, if you like racing games that is. :P
<Ghosties> 4Metal Gear Solid 4
<Dashite> I have it mainly for the exclusives.
<Ghosties> 4That's enough for me to warrant a purchase of a PS3

<Dashite> :p
<Ghosties> 4The best way to experience the game is if you've played all the titles
<Ghosties> 4Actually
<Dashite> Ghosties be all up in dis place, kicking people left and right.
<Light_Latias> 12hiyas :D
<Ghosties> 4The VERY best way to experience MGS4 is if you grew up with the series
<Cynder7> 6http://twitpic.com/4tf09m Icy :3
<Dashite> There he is.
<Ghosties> 4Like I did
<Ghosties> 4I first played MGS when I was 11
<prince-dari> I set up a site with a proper (sort of, .co.cc) domain.
<Razyn> Who, me?
<prince-dari> But we haven't switched over to that yet.
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't play MGS4 w/o an HDTV. Text is too small.
<Spyrorocks> whats bronies?
<Ghosties> 4And completed MGS4 when I was 21
<HyperMetalLugia> o.lo
<HyperMetalLugia> OHnoes
<prince-dari> Fans of the new My Little Pony TV series.
<Ghosties> 4Yes, you, Razyn :P
*Link Now Playing: Just Dance 2 - Move Your Feet
<Razyn> Oh you guys.
<drf|laptop> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-dr-name-fail.jpg
<Dashite> "<Ghosties>: Watch Razyn not return >.>"
<Spyrorocks> I think theres more fan art of MLP than all other TV series combined.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Razyn> Haha... Yes. Well, I'm not very familiar with meebit. So I refreshed a couple of times.
<Ghosties> 4Ah, glad you got the hang of it though
<prince-dari> We stream an A film, and a B film each week.
<Spyrorocks> what do you stream on?
<drf|laptop> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-facebook-fails-untitled.jpg
<Dashite> You can just click on the #bronystate and it'll bring you back in.
<Spyrorocks> so its just like a ton of fans who watch a move together and talk
<Razyn> I see.
<prince-dari> Yeah, pretty much.
<Spyrorocks> neat.
<prince-dari> We stream on veemi.
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/8g299.jpg
<prince-dari> Well, using veemi, I mean.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Talking to SR, he actuall addressed me.
<prince-dari> *Shock, awe, HORROR!
<prince-dari> actually*
<Lambda> He did?! O.o
<prince-dari> Said something like 5 lines to me.
<prince-dari> Amazing.
<Lambda> holy crap
<Lambda> what about?
<prince-dari> He wanted to know what the channel was about.
<Dashite> Besides, everyone knows that Super Metroid is the greatest video game experience ever. On consoles at least. :p
<prince-dari> And he actually said something positive about it
<prince-dari> [04:11] <Spyrorocks> so its just like a ton of fans who watch a move together and talk
<prince-dari> [04:11] <prince-dari> Yeah, pretty much.
<prince-dari> [04:11] <Spyrorocks> neat
<Razyn> Son, you best be joking.
<prince-dari> I was not ready for that. XD
<Lambda> XD
<eXAKR> Mac OS X Lion is out today
<Dashite> Are you denying the awesomeness of Super Metroid?
<drf|laptop> 03Jesus christ it's a Lion get in the car
<eXAKR> </unimportant information>
<Razyn> Everyone knows Battletoads is the best of all time.
<Dashite> Hmm...
<Razyn> Just kidding.
<junh1024-XD> <%junh1024> http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/lion-ten-things-that-bug-me/ < some gripes, I think i'll stick to 10.5/6 for now
<Dashite> I'll give you a close second on that one.
<prince-dari> If PC gaming is so great, why do consoles exist?
<Dashite> To keep all the 12 year olds out of our servers.
<prince-dari> ...
<eXAKR> Lion is too iOS-ish
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/vSfeL.jpg Derpy in TF2
<junh1024-XD> ^
<Ghosties> 4Because people are too lazy to properly work servers and specs for games on PCs
<prince-dari> >implying age is a factor to be considered
<Minecraftmads> it's made by apple so isn't that expected? lol
<eXAKR> iOS is meant for portable devices like iPhones etc.
<drf|laptop> 03implying any OSX is at all acceptable
<Minecraftmads> er
<Ghosties> 4And I actually am a console gamer at heart, I've just been playing on the PC a lot more recently
<Armads> oic
<eXAKR> Not a full desktop operating system >>
<Dashite> To keep all the dudebros our of our servers?
<prince-dari> I've met 12 year olds much more mature, tolerable, and even intellegant than adults.
<Barry> hello
<Razyn> FFIV is best pre-polygon, and until I play MGS, Majora's Mask is best post.
<drf|laptop> 03also out of boredom: oh u
<Ghosties> 4Hello Barry
<junh1024-XD> http://www.imagebam.com/image/e0ed5e139552980
<junh1024-XD> It's full, but it's very different now
<eXAKR> I prefer Microsoft's direction of taking desktop OSes to portable devices
<prince-dari> They may be few and far between, but it's not exactly fair to just rule them out as annoying idiots.
<Barry> Majora's Mask had polygons
<Razyn> Hello Barry.
<Dashite> That's what he said.
<Razyn> Yes. It did.
<prince-dari> That is SOOOOOO AWESOME
<eXAKR> If done right, it can create more flexibility while still retaining ease of use
<Razyn> It's the best 3d game. I just don't like that term
<Lambda> If you think THAT'S awesome
<Lambda> wait til you see this t-shirt
<Lambda> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=498
<drf|laptop> 03http://drfsupercenter.info/Pictures/Oh%20U.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03feel free to link to that instead.
<drf|laptop> 03>ad free
<Barry> I thought you meant post polygons as in after they stopped using it. And MM used OoT's engine
<drf|laptop> 03I could use the vps for faster speeds, too
<Barry> Now question, what's your favorite game pre and post wire frames?
<Razyn> I'm not too bright when it comes to technology I guess.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I 've seen it, that's the one I'm going to get. :D
<Lambda> :D nice!
<Razyn> Wire frames, i shall pick a game for that now.
<Dashite> Battlezone!
<Razyn> Until I think of something better, God of War I.
<junh1024-XD> please, do. it loads in 3 seconds here.
<Barry> I think SSBM was a good game that used wire frames
<Razyn> Oh wait, Dante's Inferno.
<junh1024-XD> oh, and SL1 audio
<Suinide> C7!
<Razyn> Melee was hella good. I literally played it for hours on end.
<drf|laptop> 03http://vps.drfsupercenter.info/Oh%20U.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03that's on my desktop
<Razyn> Never got to All Star mode though.
<Razyn> I'm out. It's been real.
<Dashite> Later
<Nittany_Tiger> I liked Dante's Inferno.
<Nittany_Tiger> Never bought it, but played my bro's copy.
<junh1024-XD> i chaned link 2 vps
<junh1024-XD> g
<Ghosties> 4I bought it
<Ghosties> 4If only because I thoroughly enjoy Christian mythology
<Cynder7> 6Wut? :P
<Cynder7> 6Hey
<Icydragon> Oh... it's him
<Ghosties> 4And also because Paradise Lost and Divine Comedy are interesting books
<{Skyedevil}> Hey. ---> http://www.amazon.com/Ty-Beanie-Babies-Hissy-Snake/dp/B00001QE9T/ref=pd_sim_dbs_t_1
*Cynder7 6had a sudden want to hear Fear of the Dark
<Nittany_Tiger> I never read the poem, but I've been interested in reading The Divine Comedy.
<Cynder7> 6Slither? :P
<Cynder7> 6http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitpic/photos/full/310103086.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJF3XCCKACR3QDMOA&Expires=1311218693&Signature=M62%2BhaI%2FWIDdO%2FREU9sk8XewPY4%3D
<{Skyedevil}> Hissy lol, beady eyes.
<Nittany_Tiger> I think they could have made a much better game out of the Dante's Inferno IP though.
<Cynder7> 6Aah :p
<Nittany_Tiger> It had great potential.
<Ghosties> 4You should try reading Milton's Paradise Lost too
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't really read books.
<Ghosties> 4And I agree, while I enjoyed Dante's Inferno, it was pretty lackluster
<Ghosties> 4Ironically, I don't really read books either and I'm a writer
<Nittany_Tiger> If I read a book, it'll usually be a textbook.
<Ghosties> 4But I've been interested in Christian mythology almost all my life, so...
<Cynder7> 6I like the jellyfish.. :3
<Ghosties> 4Hah, yeah, that sounds like me
<Lambda> :D
<Cynder7> 6And the octopus..
<prince-dari> When I start reading a book, I read the whole damn thing.

<prince-dari> I save pretty much all the pony pictures that I don't already have.
<prince-dari> Though my HD derped and asploded.
<prince-dari> So I lost all my pictures.
<prince-dari> But meh can probably pay someone to recover everything on it.
<Stormy> Don't tell me it asploded from too many pony pictures
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> Nah, it wasn't even 10% full.
<Manlyguy> Defecate?
<sklar> Or maybe ill till prince gets up and sing him another song like i did last time
<Armads> no, better than that
<Armads> :P
<prince-dari> And pony pictures was probably 1GB or less of 1000. X
<Manlyguy> It could still be used the same way, though.
<sklar> The song i song Dairy was the real deal that shit was emotional
<Armads> yeah but it'd be grosser :(
<lighty> Heya manly :3
<Manlyguy> That's the point, Armads. xD
<Manlyguy> Hey, Light.

<Lambda> I wonder if on OFF they aren't all crazy, saying the GOG cursewords all the time
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Lambda> maybe that's just the filter there
<Stormy> oh, maybe
<Link> x.x why do i keep forgetting that
<Manlyguy> If there was a track of Ludroths growling...
<prince-dari> Troll - ????
<Manlyguy> I'd listen to it all day.
<prince-dari> For the lulz.
<Lambda> troll should filter to ontels
<sklar> Ghosteis would be i guess a ghost who could i dont shoot lasers from his eyes and uppercut chuck and uhh had constant diarrhea for being a ghost

<drf|laptop> 03Buying the game and ripping sound effects are completely unrelated.
<prince-dari> prick = ?
<drf|laptop> 03as you still need an ISO dump of it to extract the contents
<sklar> Also sirsprinkles would also at night turn into the general sprinkle and lead the sprinkle army or some shit
<Lambda> what was the name of that sheep disguised as a robot in the original?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow

<Aurora> um
<junh1024-XD> vol 2 is under musicftp\ost\jap\2011
<Aurora> one sec
<Aurora> k
<drf|laptop> 03that would require her to have an FTP program, right:?"
<Aurora> so how would I go about getting it, aside from how we've usually been doing it
<drf|laptop> 03I should downlaod that CD myself XD as Perfect Best collections are awesome

<drf|laptop> 03I have the DVds which are even more legit

<junh1024-XD> Aurora has winamp 5+/can play flac?
<drf|laptop> 03>mac
<Aurora> ^
<junh1024-XD> >so?
<drf|laptop> 03also why 5+?
<drf|laptop> 03Winamp 2.91 plays flac...
<Icydragon> Dey hatin da lovin
<Aurora> what ever happened to mp3s and such..
<Aurora> just curious
<junh1024-XD> Cog can play FLac on Mac
<drf|laptop> 03flac is lossless so it's better quality xD
<drf|laptop> 03so therefore
<drf|laptop> 03we don't keep lower quality versions
<junh1024-XD> mp3s aren't stored on the server because >space
<drf|laptop> 03if that makes sense
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Aurora> k
<drf|laptop> 03I suppose I can convert it for you if you want
<junh1024-XD> you can downconvert flac to AAC/Mp3 using Max on Mac
<Suinide> But we keep on lovin
<junh1024-XD> filezilla and Cyberduck and Finder are free FTP clients for mac
<{Skyedevil}> ...
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Cyberduck
<drf|laptop> 03filezilla is like the best thing ever
<junh1024-XD> all 3 suck on mac so i warezed transmit
<drf|laptop> 03maybe it's the OS

<Suinide> Dont trouble yourself
<drf|laptop> 03Office for mac sucks anyway
<junh1024-XD> MAJOR CAUSALITY ISSUE HERE?
<drf|laptop> 03then again Mac itself sucks so I mean
<drf|laptop> 03that's expected
<drf|laptop> 03I suppoes the only good programs are the cross-platform ones
<drf|laptop> 03and those being crossplatform can als obe used on Windows so I seriously am not bothered
<{Skyedevil}> English lavendar.
<junh1024-XD> filezilla is X-platform
<junh1024-XD> it sucks on mac
<drf|laptop> 03it works great on Windows and Linux, you think it's coincidental that the Mac version sucks?
<junh1024-XD> Logic isn't X-platform. It's great
<Icydragon> nope
<junh1024-XD> No, it's the fault of my slow internets combined with mac neglect.
<drf|laptop> 03w/e

<junh1024-XD> For windoes, there's ASIO, MME, Dsound, etc
<{Skyedevil}> :o
<Ray> 02I'm stupid, lol. ignore plz
<junh1024-XD> none is entirely satisfactory
<drf|laptop> 03I just need to find something that can play that stupid UN Owen was Her MIDI without breaking >_>
<junh1024-XD> Linux, there's like, 10 ones and a whole pile of mess
<Link> FL Studio?
*Link RUNS
<{Skyedevil}> :o
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, the flac you made me is fine and all but the speed's a bit off so I wanted to take a stab at it myself
<drf|laptop> 03does FL Studio even play midis?
<junh1024-XD> FL Studio is not a Audio IO framework.
<junh1024-XD> no, but you can import MIDIs and assign instruments to them.
<Link> drf, yeah
<Link> ;p
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03assign instruments...?
<drf|laptop> 03so it wouldn't sound um
<drf|laptop> 03what's that word
<drf|laptop> 03proper?
<Link> basically midi remix them
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03if it won't even play in Winamp/WMP/whatever
<drf|laptop> 03I highly doubt it would play in FL
<drf|laptop> 03just because of uber massive note overload
<junh1024-XD> That's because they all use the SAME engine
<junh1024-XD> it's like Firefox & Seamonkey use Gecko.
<junh1024-XD> If FL have their own engine, fine, maybe
<drf|laptop> 03does FL Studio use the same thing that WMP uses?
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I still need to figure out what the heck that japanese program is
<drf|laptop> 03that they used to make hte video
<drf|laptop> 03nobody, not even Sparky, can figure it out :/
<junh1024-XD> There's also ACID, Presonus ONE, CAkewalk SONAR, and a bazillion other multitracks

<Aurora> cool&create is pretty awesome

<Aurora> well
<Aurora> I wont delve into that
<drf|laptop> 03whatever instrument is used
<drf|laptop> 03sounds evil
<drf|laptop> 03literally
<Aurora> but half the fandom has her as a pretty evil character
<drf|laptop> 03I think I prefer piano xD
<Link> OH GOD The GUITARS in THAT SONG, x.x
<drf|laptop> 03well piano is like my all time favorite instrument
<Aurora> I'm trying to think of other songs you'd like...because there's SO MANY AWESOME SONGS
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Aurora> like, everyone falls in love with UN Owen
<Aurora> but
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I really only got into the song because of that insane MIDI arrangement
<Aurora> there are SO MANY
<drf|laptop> 03I'm already in love with LL, sorry
*drf|laptop hides
<prince-dari> I can't remember, but it was either wood lice or earwigs that are used in some cooking recipes.
<Link> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03so someone on hoshinet is going to ask one of his friends if they know what that MIDI program is
<drf|laptop> 03and hopefully I'll figure it out once and for all :>

<junh1024-XD> nothing new, i typically get large midis on orchestral songs
<prince-dari> Bees...?
<prince-dari> Not wasps?
<prince-dari> I love bees.
<prince-dari> They're cute and fluffy.
<Link> i need some programs to make orchestral remixes
<prince-dari> Unless you're alergic I see no reason for fear.
<Link> imagine, Hotel Mario's theme Orchestrated XD
<PTS> I got stung by a swarm of bees 13 times when I went camping once
<PTS> Hate them all now
<PTS> I've never felt pain like that
<PTS> For like 12 hours too

<prince-dari> Do you just not like average sized spiders?
<prince-dari> Or do you dislike tarantulas too?
<prince-dari> They're so fluffy.
<PTS> They might have been horse flies though prince-dari
<PTS> I hate all spiders
<prince-dari> Ah.
<PTS> They were huge and black
<PTS> The bees
<PTS> and buzzed very loud
<PTS> We encountered them In a sandy area by a lake
<prince-dari> Completely black?
<prince-dari> I expect there's black bees, I've seen red wasps before.
<PTS> Yeah frk
<PTS> From my memory
<PTS> I recall them being really dark
<PTS> And very loud
<Caaz> red wasps are terrifying
<Caaz> just seem more dangerous when red.
<prince-dari> XD
<PTS> Idk if horse flies chase tho
<prince-dari> I suppose it sort of looks like a warning if red.
<PTS> Those bees chased us a good quarter mile
<PTS> It went in my shoes my back
<PTS> ._.
<prince-dari> Oh, was bees then.
<PTS> They were trying to kill us I swear
<prince-dari> Flies don't chase you, bees do.
<prince-dari> You probably walked near a hive without noticing it.
<Caaz> There's these like, wasps or bees or something in our yard
<PTS> Maybe
<Caaz> They like live in the ground
<PTS> But it was a public trail
<PTS> Like WTF don't they check for that?
<PTS> Lol
<prince-dari> Well they could have set up their hive there recently.
<PTS> It's a pretty busy camp area though
<prince-dari> I'm thinking maybe the red wasp I saw was a hornet.
<prince-dari> Because it was massive.
<PTS> Bees in my area aren't that bad though
<PTS> prince-dari: What country do you live in?
<prince-dari> UK, the red wasp (probably hornet) was on holiday though.
<PTS> Oh
<PTS> It would suck living in Australia
<prince-dari> XD
<PTS> All the big spiders live there
<PTS> I would die I swear lol
<prince-dari> I remember seeing that the wasps in Japan are the worst though.
<PTS> The only thing I like about spiders is that they eat flies
<PTS> I hate flies.
<PTS> Not scared, just find them annoying
<prince-dari> They get hornets that are 2 inches long.
<prince-dari> And they're common.
<PTS> ._.
<PTS> They can keep them :3
<prince-dari> Maybe you'd like them though.
<prince-dari> "The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees: a single hornet can kill as many as 40 honey bees per minute thanks to its large mandibles which can quickly strike and decapitate a bee"
<PTS> Lol
<prince-dari> "It takes only a few of these hornets a few hours to exterminate the population of a 30,000-member hive, leaving a trail of severed insect heads and limbs"
<Caaz> And then we brought in bears to take care of the hornets
<prince-dari> LOL
<PTS> I have hornet spray
<prince-dari> Bears to deal with hornets known as the "yak-killer".
<PTS> ;o
<prince-dari> Bears get chased away by normal wasps/bees. :P
<PTS> There's a wild bear on the loose in my area
<Caaz> Then we bring in nukes.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Caaz> "Our city is overrun with hornets!" - NUKE THE CITY.
<prince-dari> Damn.
<Caaz> With combustable lemons
<prince-dari> That's one big hornet.
<PTS> ._.
<prince-dari> Now just imagine a swarm of them. :)
<PTS> Have u seen those praying manta
<PTS> Mantua
<PTS> Mantis

<Caaz> http://papermodels.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/giant-hornet-300x228.jpg?w=300&h=228
<Caaz> Could be worse
<PTS> That can eat birds?
<PTS> Those are badass
<PTS> I like praying manti
<PTS> Mantises
<prince-dari> LOL Caaz.
<prince-dari> Goliath bird-eating spider > mantis
<prince-dari> Praying mantis could probably only eat a hummingbird at best. :P
<PTS> Lol
<PTS> Oh god
<PTS> If I see one of those giant sliders
<PTS> Spiders
<PTS> I will kill it
<prince-dari> LOL
<PTS> WITH FIRE
<prince-dari> They're 30cm long at best.
<PTS> My worst nightmare.
<PTS> Waking up with a spider on my face
<PTS> I would suicide I swear lol
<prince-dari> A spider that's bigger than your face. :P
<PTS> Oh god
<PTS> I can't believe people have like pet tarantulas
<PTS> That's crazy
<prince-dari> Tarantulas are fuzzy though. :>
<PTS> What if it escapes o.o
<PTS> Scary
<Caaz> My uncle had one
<Caaz> It escaped and no one found it until one day my uncle was in the bathroom.
<prince-dari> Wow, the bird-eater lives 15-25 years.
<prince-dari> Impressive.
<Caaz> And... yeah.
<PTS> ._.
<PTS> Omg
<PTS> That would be scary Caaz
<Caaz> He said if he wasn't on the toilet he would have shat his pants.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<PTS> Lol
<Caaz> And one time they found it in the fridge
<prince-dari> LOL
<PTS> ._.
<PTS> See?
<Caaz> That's one good diet plan
<prince-dari> I'm in your fridge, eating your ham.
<prince-dari> You need more ham.
<PTS> Dont own a giant spider

<prince-dari> They're harmless though.
<PTS> Own like fish
<PTS> Something that'll die if it tries to escape.
<Caaz> They aren't harmless
<PTS> Well nemo escaped
<Caaz> Tarantulas can shoot out those fuzzy hairs
<PTS> But that was Hax
<Caaz> usually harmless, but if you breath it in you'll be fucked up
<PTS> Nemo Irl would have died
<PTS> Just sayin'
<PTS> I heard like

<prince-dari> I wonder if the like to be stroked.

<Lakorv> that is because

<eXAKR> Minnet: get to know me

<Lakorv> what's the point of an anonymising script if it's only for a single client anyway? :P
<Lakorv> and by revealing the script version, one could check what mirc versions the script is compatible with, thus making an educated guess..

<eXAKR> Don't CTCP Version me

<Draelen> Lakorv: Minnet is displaying only the first version reply received, the mirc version came in a second reply ;p
<eXAKR> Cube grab my keyboard.
<eXAKR> ...
<eXAKR> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!!
<Lakorv> Draelen: then I /really/ don't get what the point is :p
<Lakorv> and Minnet is set to only accept one message (but does take multiple lines if they're properly encoded) because of security stuff.
<Lakorv> Else you could emulate replies to make her say just about anything.
<Lakorv> simulate, even.
<Lakorv> During an early development stage, I had a friend of me do that just to see how vulnerable it was.
<Draelen> the reply comming later at least makes more sense than if it had tried to anonymise it's self ;p
<Lakorv> nothing major but potentially compromising as you could feed any text into her and have her output it.
<Draelen> though, mirc should be sending it's version reply first, because that's apparently hardcoded
<Lakorv> true :p
<Draelen> scripts come later
<Lakorv> Minnet: version Lakorv
<Minnet> VERSION reply from Lakorv: It's feathery.

<Ascendant> seeing as I don't think it's really being removed
<eXAKR> WITHOUT upgrading.
<Lakorv> I'll chuck you in as an oper, Draelen.
<eXAKR> Because I was having trouble with it earlier today
<lightumbreon> 06off to the pub, to celebrate the last workday with some people
<Draelen> Not sure ex, google around to check
<Draelen> compmgmt.msc, secpol.msc, etc
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> I found one
<Lakorv> whee.
<Draelen> poor minnet ;p
<eXAKR> But it royally messed up system files and was only in x86
<eXAKR> And I'm on x64
<eXAKR> >>
<Lakorv> Draelen: so long since last I added someone, a bug must've snuck in :p
<Draelen> as is often the case with stuff in active development ;p
<Draelen> Minnet: help
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Draelen> Minnet: commands
<Minnet> Excuse me?
*Draelen excuses Minnet
<Ascendant> also Draelen, is it even possible to force set SRA on someone using /os raw?
<Ascendant> because that's what happened on one of my friend's networks after someone managed to get an oper's password
<Lakorv> she doesn't have a help function yet, actually
<Draelen> if you know what you are doing
<Draelen> it is possible
<Lakorv> I rewrote her command recognition, so a help function is in the TODO.
<Draelen> if you have raw command access, you can do almost anything you want
<Draelen> connect ghost servers, introduce 50k fake users, fake userhosts to control any nick/ident/host based bots, etc
<Draelen> and I see @ Lakorv, much the same for me too when coding ;p
<Draelen> command lists tend to be low on the list of needs until late on in development
<Ascendant> yeah, I know that much at least...just never realised the SRA thing though
<Draelen> Services administrator, you mean?
<Lakorv> Draelen: Minnet is written from the bottom up in pure Lua, and does not use any client for the backend.. so for bugs, blame me :p
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload the database functions
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded db.lua.
<Draelen> Lakorv: I know what you mean, I've coded two bots in C++, one was terrible, the second slightly less so ;p
<Lakorv> live insertion :>
<Lakorv> let's see now.
<Draelen> live code things are fun, I modified a friends PHP bot, it's so nice to be able to run raw code or include/add a new command/user without restarting ;p
<Draelen> very difficult to easilly get anything near that flexibility with c++ as you know
<Draelen> interpreted languages like lua and such are good for that
<Lakorv> Yeah
<Lakorv> I use sql for the user database
*Cat sneezes
<Lakorv> thoroughly secured and escaped, of course.
<Lakorv> passwords are stored only as hashes, obviously.
*Draelen nods
<Draelen> sql adds a bit of consideration for things like escaping stuff
<Ascendant> <@Draelen> Services administrator, you mean?
<Ascendant> eh?
<Ascendant> I mean services root administrator
<Draelen> you need that in the first place to access OS raw ;p
<Draelen> bit of a chicken and the egg there methinks
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long have you been online?
<Lakorv> what is this I don't even.
<Ascendant> well, that's not true with the newer versions of anope...1.8.x requires SRA to use a lot of the commands, including raw
<Lakorv> Minnet: set the output level to debug
<Minnet> Lakorv: Set what?
<Lakorv> Minnet: set the logging level to debug, goddammit
<Minnet> Lakorv: Done.
*Draelen chuckles
<Lakorv> I should give her a wider vocab.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your commands.
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
<Draelen> and Ascendant, the only to 'force set SRA' is to make services believe that person should be a root admin, for example, making services believe someone with SRA changed their nick to that new person, etc
<Lakorv> Minnet: set the output level to debug again.
<Minnet> Lakorv: Done.
<Lakorv> there, now it works.

<eXAKR> Minnet: talk to me
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<eXAKR> Minnet: be floofy
<eXAKR> Still doesn't recognise me
<Lakorv> no, because you're not added.
<Draelen> Minnet: version Draelen
<Lakorv> trying to exploit the versioning function already? :p
<Draelen> Rawr.
<Minnet> Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your commands again.
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
<Draelen> I approve of this reply screening ;p
<Lakorv> and you hit my default fallback in case of unsafe version replies :p
<Draelen> //ctcpreply Minnet VERSION \r\n $ $+ nick $ $+ server test $chr(7) $chr(7) (beepbeep!) $cr PRIVMSG #SilverWings :Rawr.
<Draelen> Ahem.
<Draelen> I wonder what classifies as safe, I be curious
<Lakorv> anything understandable for my string.match() patterns :p
<Lakorv> also
<Lakorv> 2011-07-21/16:06:05 : DEBUG Received incomprehensible CTCP VERSION reply from Draelen on tst
<Ascendant> Draelen, the weird thing was, the nicks were actually labelled as being SRAs in /os staff
<Ascendant> not * NICK [current nick]
<Ascendant> And they weren't in the config
<Draelen> was one added there that should not have been?
<Ascendant> I had to restore backups to fix it
<Ascendant> there were about 5 added
<Ascendant> it was weird
<Ascendant> because afaik SRAs are done from the config not the dbs
<Draelen> No idea, either an exploit, or using some internal undocumented commands
<Lakorv> Draelen: basically, the reason your reply wasn't accepted is it didn't fit this simple pattern:
<Draelen> which only ulines can access
<Lakorv> local reply = l:match("VERSION%s*(.-)%\001")
<Draelen> I see ;p
<Draelen> Minnet: version Draelen
<Ascendant> Yeah, I figured that, oh well
<Minnet> VERSION reply from Draelen: PRIVMSG #SilverWings :Rawr.\r\n $nick $server test   (beepbeep!)
<Draelen> hmm, it was the carridge return I included
<Lakorv> better luck next time :p
*Draelen tries linefeed
<Draelen> Minnet: version Draelen
<Draelen> Rawr.\r\n $nick $server test   (beepbeep!)
<Minnet> Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
<Lakorv> she's running on a linux system by the way, if relevant.
<Draelen> Alright, I think it's safe enough ;p
<Draelen> and I see, is the actual text of the ctcp reply displayed in the console? ;p
<Lakorv> no. :>
<Lakorv> only this
<Lakorv> 2011-07-21/16:11:51 : DEBUG Received incomprehensible CTCP VERSION reply from Draelen on tst
*Draelen nods
<Draelen> there's some fun things one can do for text directly displayed to the console that users can manipulate
<Lakorv> I know.
<Lakorv> she's slightly vulnerable for that
<Lakorv> but then you need to know what's displayed and what not :p
<Lakorv> I should probably fix that though.
<Lakorv> updated the git repo a lil' by the way
<Lakorv> didn't push earlier.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your commands
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your functions
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
<Lakorv> Minnet: some weird unknown comm14and14 stuff.
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload funcs.lua
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
<Lakorv> Minnet: some weird unknown comm14and0 stuff.
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload functions.
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
<Lakorv> okay, so she doesn't handle colours in the middle of a line any well
<Lakorv> but people who use that may as well go die
<Lakorv> so it's their fault for not being able to use her properly.
<Draelen> I see ;p
*Draelen may be distracted at work now and then</info>
<Lakorv> colours leave digits amidst the characters, which will confuse her.
<Lakorv> I've implemented support for completely coloured lines, but not partially coloured ones.
<Draelen> One of my favourites is something like str_repeat($chr(8),100) $+ 2011-07-21/16:11:51 : DEBUG Error returned from SQL Server: Internal fire detected in database
<Draelen> As an example, to cause the bot owner to have a moment of confusion
<Draelen> character 8 usually deletes the previous character before it in the console
<Lakorv> :p
<Draelen> so you get a whole line to yourself
<Lakorv> have fun
<Lakorv> would be nice if you could find a vulnerability or two so I could get rid of them.
<Draelen> I unfortunatley don't know her console layout, but I've done it with my friends PHP bot a few times, and had a good chuckle
<Lakorv> hehe
<Draelen> giving fake errors on the simplest of commands, etc
<Lakorv> I don't think you can manage to make her run your own code though
<Lakorv> I've tried avoiding that
<Lakorv> but go ahead, it'd be fun :p
<Lakorv> and the layout is, she prints stuff stupidly through print(), without regard for terminal size or anything.
<Draelen> likely not, as long as you have been careful where the content of text may be included in a variable that gets dereferenced perhaps once too many times
<Draelen> there's likely few places that can happen
<Lakorv> mhm.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your functions
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
<Lakorv> 14Minnet: say hi.
<Minnet> Hi.
<Lakorv> okay, still works.
<Draelen> it's nice to be able to reload parts like that ;p
<Lakorv> yeah, I like it :p
<Lakorv> and as a safer alternative to running code directly given to her
<Lakorv> you can instead use a designated file, and then reload it.
<Lakorv> so only the admin can hotload improvised code.
<Draelen> one command I find useful, is something called sraw, which feeds everything after the command as if it were a line of text from the server
<Lakorv> hm
<Lakorv> what do you use it for?
<Draelen> useful for debugging/testing situations that may be difficult to try replicate on the server
*Draelen puts an example together
<Lakorv> ah, yeah.
<Draelen> Minnet: sraw :Lakorv!lakorv@TST-B986778D.bb.online.no PART #silverwings :Blargh
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Draelen> and so on, if testing her user database of channel users, and such
<Lakorv> mhm.
<Lakorv> you just reminded me of an unrelated function..
<Lakorv> Minnet: say hello to Draelen
<Minnet> Draelen: Hello
<Draelen> Minnet: Hello
<Minnet> Excuse me?
*Draelen chuckles
<Lakorv> she thinks it's a command :<
<Draelen> Minnet is forgetful
<Lakorv> Hello, Minnet.
<Minnet> Hello there, Lakorv.
<Draelen> Figured as much ;p
<Lakorv> morning, Minnet
<Minnet> Good afternoon, Lakorv.
<Draelen> Minnet: what is the time?
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Draelen> Minnet: time
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Lakorv> should implement that.
<Lakorv> >.>
<Lakorv> she has a simple ctcp time response though.
<Lakorv> now to debug the uptime function..
<Draelen> I see it
<Lakorv> 2011-07-21/16:29:35 : INFO Received CTCP TIME request from Draelen on tst
<Lakorv> :p
<Draelen> har
<Draelen> hmm o.o
*Draelen plots

<Lakorv> :|
<Lakorv> Minnet: set output level to internal
<Minnet> Lakorv: Done.
<Lakorv> this is going to give me some ugly output, but okay..
<Lakorv> when debug's not enough~
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long is the system uptime?
<Lakorv> goddammit.
<Lakorv> Minnet: reload your commands
<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.

<Minnet> Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long is your uptime?
<Minnet> Lakorv: I've been online for 50 minutes.
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long is your system's uptime, then?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The computer went up 1 day, 15 hours and 37 minutes ago.
<Draelen> Seems to work now ;p
<Lakorv> yup.
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long you been online now?
<Minnet> Lakorv: I've been online for 55 minutes.
<Barry> yo
<Draelen> No idea if that worked, but peek at Minnets console
<Draelen> Yes, I have a little too much free time at work today~
<Lakorv> I see nothing :o
<Lakorv> Minnet: set output level to debug
<Minnet> Lakorv: Done.
<Lakorv> try again?
<Draelen> mirc may have capitalisiedified it
<Lakorv> at normal output levels she doesn't bother with unknown commands and the like. She's on debug now though, give it a try.
<Draelen> Hmm, did try ;p
<Lakorv> still nothing~
<Lakorv> what'cha doing? :p
<Draelen> Interesting, let me try something a little less invalid
<Draelen> //ctcp Minnet $str($chr(8),100) $+ 2075-11-21/16:35:51 : WARNING  1 new message(s) from the future: Help us! Minnet has taken over! The networks are down, it was too late, but we were warned in a $cr $lf $chr(8) e e
<Draelen> Yes, rather random, pity minnet ignored it ;p
<Lakorv> ah, you're sending a custom ctcp?
<Lakorv> nah, she filters all but those she knows~
<Draelen> hmm
<Draelen> Minnet: Version Draelen
<Minnet> Draelen: Version who?
<Draelen> Minnet: version Draelen
<Lakorv> whatever did you do /this/ time?
<Armageddon> ohai
<Draelen> that may work better, ctcp != ctcpreply ;p
<Lakorv> :p
<Minnet> Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
*Lakorv petpets Minnet
<Draelen> Indeed, well, that's my free time gone for today, hometime soon ;p
<Lakorv> enjoy :>

<Ascendant> but come on
<Ascendant> I'm hoping it's not designed to be server software
<eXAKR> I was really, SERIOUSLY thinking of getting a Mac next year
<eXAKR> Now, I'm definitely sticking to PC.
<Ascendant> for all the bloody love and hate in the world
<drf-Droid> I always knew I didn't like eXAKR
*drf-Droid hides
<Ascendant> people who run their SERVERS on macs
*Ascendant facepalms
<Lakorv> OSX is Unix based, so it's better than *cough* using Windows *cough* for servers.
<Ascendant> that's true
<drf-Droid> I beg to differ
<drf-Droid> Windows Server actually works
<Ascendant> but still
<Ascendant> if you're going to get a unix-based server
<eXAKR> But Mac OS X = not server, except for their server editions
<Ascendant> at least use linux or freebsd or something
<eXAKR> Yeah
<Ascendant> eXAKR
<eXAKR> Unless all you serve is podcasts and such
<Ascendant> This guy runs a bloody website on his mac at home
<eXAKR> Hmmm?!
<Lakorv> all OS X releases can be turned into servers.
<Lakorv> just like any Posix OS
<Lakorv> because they're Posix/Unix.
<drf-Droid> Pos OS?
<drf-Droid> yeah that sounds right
<Lakorv> Posix is a standard.
<Lakorv> or a set of standards, rather.
<eXAKR> Even Windows has a bit of Unix baked in, no?
<Ascendant> windows != unix
<Lakorv> I think some tcip stuff was taken from Unix, yes
<Ascendant> well, there are obviously /some/ elements
<Lakorv> but it's mainly DOS and NT - that is, in-house dev.
<Ascendant> but the overall design and core is DOS and N-
<Ascendant> yeah
<eXAKR> You know Microsoft quite heavily based at least a few concepts on Unix
<Lakorv> oh, concepts, truly
<Lakorv> but actual code, not so much.
<eXAKR> Indeed
<eXAKR> Everything's out there is now Unix or NT
<drf-Droid> NT ftw
<Ascendant> unix > NT
<drf-Droid> for servers maybe
<drf-Droid> for actually doing stuff, nah
<eXAKR> Mostly for servers
<eXAKR> But unless you need a super high-end workstation, I feel Windows is fine
<drf-Droid> ^
<Ascendant> windows for a workstation is actually decent
<drf-Droid> my VPS is Windows, works like a charm
<Ascendant> but windows is best for personal use
<Ascendant> and gaming
<eXAKR> Heh, yeah
<drf-Droid> AIM for Android, y u no work
<eXAKR> Windows sucks when it comes to multiple users
<Lakorv> Windows doesn't give me enough control. I prefer full access to the OS and modding possibilities.
<eXAKR> That hulking registry
<drf-Droid> >admin account
<eXAKR> And the fact that Group Policy Editor isn't available on Home editions
<drf-Droid> who the f*** uses home editions
<Ascendant> <Lakorv> Windows doesn't give me enough control. I prefer full access to the OS and modding possibilities.
<Ascendant> Yeah, but for simple use, it's fine
<eXAKR> For some people it can be too much
