<Irish_Pony> But the idea was cancelled when it would cost serveral millions of dollars :P
<Videofreak1127[M]> Irish_Pony: That's a LOT of paint
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Panda> Sumica: why is your OC doing the "monkey"?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the only thing I know of Robotech is the game for the Gamecube

<Yahooz> Colbert watch out! Drone!
<flutter_spin> It SEEMS easy to do, but sounds hard
<CriticKitten> I'd totally vote for Colbert. >_>
<SolairePony89> Lucid[M]: If I've learned anything from Japanese writing, it's that you gotta be there from the beginning in order to have even the slightest chance to figure out what's going on
<Yahooz> Colbert 2012? we came close XD
<CriticKitten> Have him do the show every night out of the Oval Office.
<flutter_spin> heh, reminds me of the fanfic of Colbert being thrown into Equestria

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> DeathStar: hai sis how was school
<owlicious> hah
<Ascendant> masculine gestures and all that
<DeathStar> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: alright

<Spriggals> BONE SAWWW
<OtakuTom> WindWhistler: It's probably the most logical choice, since they don't have a firebender with them. High-pressure water is used very often to cut metals.
<hen3ry> Water is a primary force of erosion...

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> DeadpoolDash: theres a stream on
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dalekkahn: u hear the voice of the general guy at the end in red?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> mario_pony: shhh
<mario_pony> :O
<Phase4> 00,02dont think i can get this too land
<dalekkahn> Phase4: don't worry, no kerbal left behind is the marines saying, not the space program
<Chrysalis> this is gonna sound oddly specific, but does anyone know a program that will record an audio feed but only while a button is held?
<DeadpoolDash> internet crapped for Phase4 again
<dalekkahn> Audio feed as in mic in? or audio feed as in desktop sounds?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Mistress_Molestia
<CupcakeWarrior> 0.0
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Mistress_Molestia: where?
<Chrysalis> basically a mic in
<Mistress_Molestia> Here
<Phase4> 00,02interderped
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Mistress_Molestia
<Mistress_Molestia> Hello my subjects
<Phase4> 00,02stream should fix itself
<DeadpoolDash> derpy gets all of us all of the time
<Chrysalis> dalekkahn i need to find a way of recording my voicecomms when playing multiplayer
<Chrysalis> without just recording the entire audio stream, cause my keyboard is really loud
<dalekkahn> Basically google for audio recording with push to talk feature in it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> what do ya guys think a young Draconequus would look like? kind of a pony like shape or what?
<dalekkahn> and Phase4: don't worry about it. No kerbal left behind is the marines saying, not the space program. :P
<Phase4> 00,02dalekkahn, XD
<OneTrickPony> hello everyone
<OneTrickPony> ded
<OtakuTom> Hi OneTrickPony
<dalekkahn> Chrysalis: off the top of my head (and google) I don't know of any well know ones. You might be able to use audacity and clip off or dampen the keyboard sounds.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey OneTrickPony hows it goin?
<CupcakeWarrior> Hello OneTrickPony
<OneTrickPony> o hey
<sub06905> Hello OneTrickPony
<dalekkahn> Chrysalis: here is the link to the current version: http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
<dalekkahn> If you want to check it out and see if it will work
<Carpathia> for those of you who havnt played this, i recommend it http://www.comdotgame.com/play/rainbow-dash-attack
<OtakuTom> Audacity is good for being able to remove certain sounds. I was able to even get rid of the sound of background airflow using it before.
<OneTrickPony> does anyone know if it would be worth getting a synth for producing music?
<OneTrickPony> Carpathia: yes! I did not know this existed
<Phase4> 00,02had to do stuff
<Chrysalis> dalekkahn yeah i use audacity
<Chrysalis> but as the games go on for an hour
<Chrysalis> trimming all that audio would be a nightmare
<sub06905> trim all the audio :$
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hmmm....:S hows does an idea of a wandering pony helping saved Equestria,but at a STEEP price and redeeming himself and regaining that which he lost as a story?
<Phase4> 00,02still in geosync orbit :3
<Phase4> 00,02has drifted slightly to the right, if this were a real satelite it'd have stationkeeping motors
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02what to do next
<Phase4> 00,02nother satelite?
<Phase4> 00,02visit a planet?
<Phase4> 00,02or blow shit up
<CupcakeWarrior> No kickbot?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 try and hit the new sattellite with a rocket
<sub06905> blow shit up
<Phase4> 00,02bugger
<OtakuTom> I just used a short recording of airflow with no other mic input and spread it to the whole video, and it worked. I think you could probably do the same thing with a short audio clip of you typing.
<Phase4> 00,02interderps
<Phase4> 00,02i'm getting lag
<Chrysalis> OtakuTom i have a mechanical keyboard, it can be louder than me speaking
<sub06905> spy sappin my stream!
<OtakuTom> ah
<DeadpoolDash> skyrimjob
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im off 2 bed cya everypony :)
<Chrysalis> is that a tardis module?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, that would be insanely dificult
<BrOnyxia> hey everypony
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yes, thats why it would be fun to watch
<sub06905> night Sketch_Toku_Brony
<dalekkahn> Phase4: OMG IT's the tarids
<OneTrickPony> hai BrOnyxia
<Chrysalis> lol, stacked tardis?
<Carpathia> sorry for late reply about audacity, but i use it to remove bgm from mlp episodes so i can get just the voices
<OneTrickPony> lol
<OneTrickPony> XD
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Tardis mod
<dalekkahn> Where's the noise
<OneTrickPony> imagine that in real life
<cow> Hello every one
<OneTrickPony> hiya cow

<Phase4> 00,02well this game has no controls for space-time warping
<Chrysalis> dalekkahn time lord science
<Phase4> 00,02so its just a rocket with huge power and near infinite fuel
<cow> Phase you gonna make deaspace happen up there
<cow> :D

<CupcakeWarrior> FairysHuff: You are not serious
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh

<DashWithRainbows> Besides, it's funny as hell.
<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows its not similar to they lyra plushie

<DashWithRainbows> It's the same purpose
<Chrysalis> its far far worse
<DashWithRainbows> as a coin purse
<FairysHuff> I wish I hadn't seen that O_o
<DashWithRainbows> Could've been worse
<DashWithRainbows> It could have been used
<d3rb> ok, this one is more than just a "pocket" though

<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows you should hear him on XBLX
<XAX> I would use that plushie as an iPod carrier
<XAX> And it would be awesome
<FairysHuff> Yeh. Despite it's disturbing nature it seems well made and large. I like large cuddly plushies
<DashWithRainbows> Chrysalis Meh, I would piss him off. I troll like mad on xbox
<XAX> I'd attach a strap to it and carry it everywhere
<Chrysalis> man i would love a lifesize luna plushie
<XAX> Chrysalis: me vista
<XAX> AUTOCORRECT
<CupcakeWarrior> I want a life size Lyra plushie

<Capn_Gavn> showing*

<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: Cause she's not
<Meanwhile> She's not
<|Discord|> CCCP: SHE SUCKS PLOT
<Irish_Pony> Because Meanwhile loves her :P
<|Discord|> BUCK TRIXIE
<CCCP> Videofreak1127[M]: D:
<Chrysalis> CCCP because shes a pony, all ponies are awesome
<CCCP> |Discord|: LIES
<Meanwhile> Shaddup Irish_Pony.
<Chrysalis> also, meanwhile loves trixie
<Meanwhile> And shaddup Chrysalis.
<CCCP> Chrysalis: This is true
<|Discord|> CCCP: SHE WAS A BITCH TO APPLEJACK.
<Chrysalis> he loves her so much hes embarrassed about it
<Meanwhile> AND shaddup CCCP.
<Chrysalis> so he hides behind an aggressive facade
<Meanwhile> Stop shipping me with Trixie!
<|Discord|> Meanwhile: I should do that
<CCCP> Meanwhile oh but i thought you like had a thing for Trixe ;)
<Chrysalis> but we know, that behind that facade, is the beating heart of a man in love, in love with trixie
<WindWhistler> I saw a picture that made me feel sorry for Trixie
<Panda> CCCP: but... trixie is best sham :)
<alexxm> why can't everyone just shut up about this
<Panda> WindWhistler: same here
<Meanwhile> I hate you guys sometimes.
<WindWhistler> Unfortunately, I can't remember where I found it.
<CCCP> |Discord|: but shes TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie!
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: oh come on the way you can tell something is really good is when a british guy with a sexy moustache loves it :3
<Om> Panda: Give me yo money :[
<CCCP> lol
<WindWhistler> Well, actually, I know where I found it, but the thread is probably long gone by now.
<|Discord|> The reason I do not discord trixie is because she seems to be doing fine on her own.
*Panda gives Om all his bits
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: That's why she's not awesome
*Om sashays of
<Om> off
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: If she was humble, then I'll be able to stand her
<Panda> Om: btw, my ballances is 0 :)
<Meanwhile> I will never feel sorry for Trixie because canonical she's a horrible person.
*|Discord| realizes he is awesome. He forgot
<Chrysalis> why dont you try seating her Videofreak1127[M]?
<Om> Panda: So is mine :)
<CountDoofus> One fanfic about Trixie made my opinion about her make a 180° turn. Fanon-wise, anyway.
<Videofreak1127[M]> Chrysalis: Practice what you preach
<CountDoofus> Canon, she's still a bitch.
<CCCP> Videofreak1127[M]: but she IS awsome!!!!!! her character is much more deep than you would think
<Chrysalis> Videofreak1127[M] i like all ponies
<Om> Panda: Good mornin to you by the way
<thegt90> u know what i love
<CountDoofus> Ponies?
<CCCP> Trixie > Luna >:3
<Chrysalis> thegt90 Mmmmmmbananads
<Meanwhile> I can ignore Trixie's fanon interpretations because frankly they are irrelevant.
<thegt90> yes and pony cars
<Chrysalis> CCCP but Luna is best pony, your math is wrong
<CCCP> Luna = worst pony
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: She was in one episode, 2 if you count Queen Chrysalis. Faust wrote her so that kids would learn humility because no one can stand her boasting
<CCCP> JK! :D
<Irish_Pony> No! The true best pony is....ALL OF US!
<|Discord|> Wait one second...Trixie had some of the same powers as Twilight Sparkle...could Trixie be Twilights aunt trying to get revenge on her sisters daughter?
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: YOU'RE HEAD SHALL BE ON A SILVER PLATTER!!!!
<|Discord|> OMG CANNON\
<CCCP> Videofreak1127[M]: shes still a good character
<CountDoofus> Fluttershy's my favorite, but I killed her in a fic I'm writing. Go figure.
<Chrysalis> CCCP you were lucky you recinded that
<CCCP> Irish_Pony: awwww
<Chrysalis> i was planning a lynching
<derpy_pony> http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/funny-gifs-while-on-a-diet.gif
<CCCP> Chrysalis: :P
<CCCP> but to be honest i never understood why people like Luna soo much
<Panda> Om: good morning to you too ^^
<CountDoofus> derpy_pony: :D
<|Discord|> derpy_pony: Is that nutela?
<derpy_pony> yep
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: I just don't like her. I wanted to punch her in the face so bad when I watched that episode
<darksunlight> yea
<|Discord|> A NUTELA AND BACON SANDWHICH
<Videofreak1127[M]> but then I'd break my computer
<RaveBrony> Time to get ready for my gradutation everypony, ill bbl!! :)

<CCCP> by RaveBrony
<alexxm> hey BrOnyxia some people argueing about trixie again
<Meanwhile> Bye RaveBrony
<CountDoofus> Cya, RaveBrony :)
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: I find that I wanted to punnch a lot of the antagonists, like the parasprites
<BrOnyxia> alexxm: ;o
<valoreins> damn my connection lags a lot, i think i need to be off now
<Meanwhile> I hate show-offs.
<CountDoofus> Later, valoreins
<|Discord|> When gilda yelled at Fluttershy...I cried and promissed to get revenge on her, DISCORD vs GILDA, battle of the assholes
<CCCP> Videofreak1127[M]: aww i like parasprites
<alexxm> bye valoreins
<Videofreak1127[M]> CCCP: They're cute, cuddly, balls of DEATH
<Nebula-Grey> And I return
<Nebula-Grey> What are cute balls of death?
<CCCP> Videofreak1127[M]: lol
<|Discord|> Videofreak1127[M]: I made them
<alexxm> hey Nebula-Grey hows your day been
<CCCP> Nebula-Grey: parasprites
<Nebula-Grey> Kirby is a cute ball of death
<Nebula-Grey> He's a black hole with feet
<Videofreak1127[M]> That does not surprise me, Discord
<BrOnyxia> alexxm: idk.. dun rly like her tho but wouldnt care if someone has a different opinion
<alexxm> the death star is a cute ball of death
<|Discord|> I made everything in the everfree forest
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well Kirby is a psyhcopath, so cute ball of death describes him pretty well.
<Videofreak1127[M]> How do you type the lines like in Discord's name? I'm a bit of a noob at this.:'(
<Irish_Pony> I just learned an interesting fact: The guy who played the candle in Beuty and the Beast is in Law and Order :P
<Nebula-Grey> Get back in your stone prison

<sonicrainboomer259> NUDE

<VDXRetrotainment> Dark_Horst: She's whispered.
<Om> FairysHuff: I'm sure that is the point >_> <_< probably not though...
