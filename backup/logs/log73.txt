Just don't go to bed, and instantly, you'll see stars and galaxies. All of this can be yours for the head of the Elements of Harmony. But I'm not done yet.

<MirthTinker> @Ziltoid we're doing it in #Ponies&Dragons
<Aurora> 12-14, keep an eye out
<prince-dari> Gay scenes on TV isn't really controversial here any more.
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: We're too politically correct over here. *rolls eyes*
<Aurora> 6that's actually....next week o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> I just made mini fanfic.
<Kyu> 07hurr
<Silverscreen> 11congrats, Nittany.
<Aurora> 6I'M OK WITH THIS
<Silverscreen> 11We don't even have Lesbian television over here. >.>
<RobotPinkie> lol I guess it doesn't come up when I'm in the US a lot.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Nittany_Tiger> But can I interest you in Kaboom?
<Aurora> 6dude kyu
<Aurora> 6go post in initiation
<Aurora> 6we've been waiting for you
<prince-dari> Series 1 finale.
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, people in this country are too freaking uptight about sexuality.
<prince-dari> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Roara I have a question
<Aurora> 6yes?
<Aurora> 6I have an answer
<Aurora> 6maybe
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Have you ever seen Summer Wars?
<RobotPinkie> I mean I know the right wing christians aren't keen on homosexuality.
<Umbreon> 12no
<Aurora> 6no
<Silverscreen> 11And you just hit the problem on the head, RobotPinkie
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm, all right.
<RobotPinkie> But most people support gay marriage, I thought
<Dave_BroZilla> what an astutely mild observation
<Kyu> 07hurr
<Kyu> 07I was gonna wait for Sparky
<Kyu> 07but ok I guess
<prince-dari> This is the series finale now guys.
<Dave_BroZilla> But it's America, and what really pisses me off is that it affects Canada
<prince-dari> Be ready for the awesome. :D
<Nittany_Tiger> Marriage in Christianity is considered a heterosexual ritual. That's where the shit hits the fan.
<Denied_Existence> Here I am again.
<RobotPinkie> I'm watching!
<prince-dari> IT'S A TRAP!
<prince-dari> They couldn't resist putting that in once more.
<Silverscreen> 11The problem is that the people in power are either right-wing, bible thumping christians, or are afraid of losing their position by showing support for the Gay community.
<Denied_Existence> ITS A TRAP!?
<Kyu> 07er
<Kyu> 07o3o;
<Kosoveon> I've heard of it
<Dave_BroZilla> We're a lot looser about it like the UK, but very few TV shows can be proud to say 100% Canadian
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah?
<Kosoveon> sounds like a cool movie
<RobotPinkie> Well, I guess you have to pander to your base...
<Kosoveon> but I never got around to seeing it
<Dave_BroZilla> Which sucks
<Kosoveon> is it any good?
<Dave_BroZilla> I want boobies all times of day without having to PPV
<prince-dari> Lolz.
<Silverscreen> 11Fuck the base. They're elected to make the right decision, and that's what they should do.
<prince-dari> Dat nudity
<Denied_Existence> ...
<Silverscreen> 11dat ass?
<RobotPinkie> Not a fan of having two political blocks
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes, it's really good.
<Aurora> 6gonna be migrating houses again soon
<Dave_BroZilla> wat
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, I see greed as a larger problem in this country than religious conservatism. In either way, people don't want to change.
*Kosoveon should see it, then
<Silverscreen> 11Walking nude around the house. Like a boss.
<prince-dari> It's the rapture!
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: Is it going on in october?
<Nittany_Tiger> When Republicans would rather undermine the basis of the US govt than to give up their tax cut, things are off.
<Dave_BroZilla> BRINGING EVERYONE TO THE PRESENT TO JUDGE THEM ALL AT ONCE
<Silverscreen> 11End of Days is a schwarzenager movie.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And all right Roara
<Dave_BroZilla> Apocalypse Now is a Mel Gibson movie
<prince-dari> Is what going on in October? :o
<RobotPinkie> I predict that people will predict the end of the world until the end of the world.
<Silverscreen> 11lol, Dari
<Nittany_Tiger> No-one knows the day, hour, etc of the second coming of Christ, not even Christ himself.
<Silverscreen> 11A bible-thumper was going around saying the world would end May 22nd or sometime around then.
<Nittany_Tiger> That dude that calculated the rapture was wrong.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that was a nice rapture party, though
<Silverscreen> 11When May came and went, he said that was the "silent judgement" and the real demise would be in October.
<FlutterHi> I love the end of the world
<Nittany_Tiger> And another embarrassment to my belief.
<FlutterHi> I get to party because the world is going to end
<Denied_Existence> DAMMIT, YA CAUSED A TIME PARADOX!
<FlutterHi> I get to party because the world is ending
<FlutterHi> and then I get to party because the world didn't end
<Silverscreen> 11I don't mind any religion, as long as it's not getting shoved in my face.
<Denied_Existence> @FlutterHi Do I get to party too?
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't shove my religion (belief) in people's faces.
<FlutterHi> @Denied_Existence HEELLLLLSSS YEAHHHH
<RobotPinkie> Eh, presumably it's not the same as your belief, I don't blame every christian for wackjobs like Camping
<Silverscreen> 11Especially when it comes to political issues where religion doesn't belong.
<FlutterHi> =]
<Nittany_Tiger> Core of Christianity: Love and tolerance.
<Denied_Existence> ~yay~
<FlutterHi> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Kind of like something else...
<RobotPinkie> Wait, so...
<RobotPinkie> @Jesusmeter Twilight Sparkle
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Twilight Sparkle is 81% Jesus. (1110)
<FlutterHi> brb going downsatairs
<prince-dari> I think that religion is usually a good thing and that the intention behind it is good, though I'm not religious myself.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Jason and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Silverscreen> 11Agreed, Dari.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the extremists that give religion a bad name.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's sad that my religion is on the chopping block. Now I know how muslims feel.
<Silverscreen> 11The problem comes when people use religion to do meaningless things because it's "what their god would want"
<prince-dari> LOL JACK
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, I'm glad western values are based on both Christianity and Greek philosophy.

<prince-dari> DAT MUSIC
<Dave_BroZilla> People say cartoons in the 90s were awesome
<Dave_BroZilla> I tend to agree, but whenever my mind wanders to Looney Tunes
<Dave_BroZilla> Nothing compares to the voice talent of Mel Blanc, the directorial skills of Fritz Freling et al.
<RobotPinkie> Looney Tunes was like... the golden age of cartoons
<Dave_BroZilla> Indeed
<Dave_BroZilla> As a child, I always wondered how Bugs would get that barber seat down from that height
<Dave_BroZilla> he'd have to climb that pole all the way up again
<Dave_BroZilla> WET PAINT
<Ziltoid> @pony elmer fudds first r34 encounter

<Dave_BroZilla> I'm hunting Gwiffons!
<Dave_BroZilla> huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh
<Dave_BroZilla> love the piano keys
<RobotPinkie> love this part
<Dave_BroZilla> Fun fact: Apparently the reason Bugs dresses up in women's clothes is based on the fact that the animators, when they lost bets, ahd to dress up in womens' clsothes for the day

<Dashite> Are you planning to go through all the regulars in this chat for your shipping stories Silvermane? :p
<RDash> Rofl, Robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> or maybe not, because then I have to be stuck with The damn Wonderbolts
<DubtrotMaster> dubtrotmasterxbigmac im no good at coming up with a good fanfic
<SilverMane> actually i was writing Soipony's story so that ReticentSmolder wouldn't have an excuse not to write his Silvermanes stories
<Dashite> Ah
<SoiPony> lol
<Chimera> 04bed
<Chimera> 04may be on, most likely not
<SilverMane> you know, for the number of filliesin the show, and number of colts on here, why do we get so much gay clopfics?
<Dashite> Because everyone is gay in Equestria.
<SoiPony> lol who knows
<SilverMane> but why doesn't anyone try to ship with the fillies?
<Dashite> Why else is there so little straight shipping among the mane 6?
<SoiPony> idk
<RobotPinkie> because there are only two colts in the show who are around enough?
<SilverMane> cuz there is so few colts with actual roles in the show
*Dermathil doesn'T have a ponysona and don'T need one.
<RobotPinkie> Prince Blueblood doesn't count, for obvious reasons.
<Dashite> Dermathil is no a grumpy earth pony.
<SoiPony> >give it time
<RobotPinkie> Everyone just hates him.
<Dashite> is now*
<SilverMane> pretty much, unless you extrapolate forever with Big Mac, Spike, Braeburn, or Prince Blueblood, you have to make an OC pony for straight shipping
<SoiPony> yup
<Dermathil> uh? you think I'm a grumpy earth pony?
<RobotPinkie> I have no ponysona either... I only have ponies.
<Dashite> Hmm...

<Glacymr> 12not to mention the appearance of pokemon catcher is going to wreck everything
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<Glacymr> 12they may not even be able to get Hydreigon out
<NightSeas> 12I don't think they can o-o
<Glacymr> 12if you are going to play stage 2s in this format after catcher comes out

<Cynder7> 6And hey Uxie! ^^
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10*Hugs* C7
<UxieLover> 11Hola!
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10I was moving
<Cynder7> 6How've you guys been? ^^
<Cynder7> 6:O
<UxieLover> 11I know! :)
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10i got on to see you guys
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10i have been good
<UxieLover> 11Okay! :)
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10can't wait till the new spyro
<Cynder7> 6Good to know ^^
<UxieLover> 11Yeah, me too!
<Cynder7> 6I wanna see what it's like.. :O
<UxieLover> 11I've seen two pre-release gameplays on YouTube. The game looks fun!
<UxieLover> 11It's just too bad many people are refusing to try it out
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10well the wii and 3ds might not be the same as the rest
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10yea
<UxieLover> 11That's right
<Dragoran> heya Skylands
<Skylands> 10hiya
<UxieLover> 11I think the haters only want the classic series
<Cynder7> 6They should give it a chance at least..
<Skylands> 10I don't think I'll be at that meeting today
<Skylands> 10Just letting you know
<UxieLover> 11Yes, but they'd rather whine at the trailers than check out the walkthroughs
<Cynder7> 6I'm not that crazy about it so far but I think it might be quite good..
<Dragoran> Heh well, I think it was yesterday and it didn't even happen
<UxieLover> 11Yep, it's got some awsome music and backgrounds.
<Skylands> 10ohlol
<Skylands> 10I kept thinking it was a Thursday for some reason
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cynder7> 6It comes out in November,right?
<UxieLover> 11I just hope that the game can get at least 33% of the faux-fans to try it out
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10oh i'm on my laptop
<UxieLover> 11October 18th
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10well
<UxieLover> 11I understand
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10September for US and EU and October 18th for AU
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10And Q4 for the rest
<UxieLover> 11Hm, maybe
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10which means near november
<UxieLover> 11Hey, DSD, thought of any stories yet?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10getting a thought going to go watch some videos today and you?
<Cynder7> 6Anyway..I think I'll watch some videos before I actually decide I want to get it..I probably will though at some point.. :3
<Cynder7> 6brb
<UxieLover> 11Nope. Not a single plot... yet!
<UxieLover> 11The stonger the hatedom, the more fans these stories will get. Trust me
<UxieLover> 11Baised on the ratings for the trailers, around 12% of them are true fans. The rest are the haters who just whine
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10yea
<UxieLover> 11Maybe some of the stories should focus on other characters as well as Spyro.
<UxieLover> 11One should focus on Sheila, one on Sgt. Byrd, one on Elora. You know what I mean
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10yea
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10maybe a split story
<UxieLover> 11Yeah.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10like a story about SGT Byrd and another Story about Sheila
<UxieLover> 11Good one
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10so tht way we can get more stories
<Dermathil> hello everybrony.
<UxieLover> 11We should also do one for a few world-baised stories, such as Skelos Badlands
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10Yea
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10So where should we put these after we are done on DA?
<Dman> Hey! Dermathil!
*Dermathil waves a hoof at prince-dari, Dman and Dashite.
*Dman waves back.
<UxieLover> 11I don't know
<Dman> I haven't drawn anything more, by the way
<UxieLover> 11We've lost our forums at the Spyro Wiki (thanks to some Russian)
<Dermathil> I was about to ask!
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10we could there is a good fan base there
<Dermathil> >herdmind for the xth time
<Dman> all day erry day son. but yea, I'm sorry i haven't drawn any more yet

<UxieLover> 11I think so
<UxieLover> 11But no one's been active apart from myself, and some person who created warning templates
<Dman> You'll be fine =]
<UxieLover> 11At the moment, we need the spites for the characters of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
<UxieLover> 11We currently have none, in contrast to the Spyro Wiki.
<Asterisk> !sneas
*Sneas still belongs to Skylands for 28 more minutes
<DSD> 10well
<UxieLover> 11http://www.darkspyro.net/
<Asterisk> ):
<UxieLover> 11Maybe we can get some here?
<DSD> 10see i was hoping Darke had moved everything over
<UxieLover> 11No. In fact, she's not been active for weeks
<UxieLover> 11We've yet to obtain the Eliment images
<DSD> 10http://www.darkspyro.net/skylanders/
<DSD> 10Dang
<UxieLover> 11Right there as we "speak"
<DSD> 10are they canon?
<DSD> 10the names
<UxieLover> 11I think so
<UxieLover> 11This gives out a lot of infomation
<UxieLover> 11The eliment names are canon
<DSD> 10yea
<DSD> 10even Aura didn't have any images on this
<UxieLover> 11True
<Cynder7> 6Ok,screw it..I really can't play TS2 anymore.. ._.
<UxieLover> 11Hm? The elements remind me of Final Fantasy XII...
<DSD> 10why?
<DSD> 10yea
<DSD> 10They do
<UxieLover> 11Sims 2?
<UxieLover> 11I've not played that for two years
<Cynder7> 6I'm gonna try fixing TS3..I can't go back to TS2 now.. -._
<UxieLover> 11...and I never want to play it again!
<Cynder7> 6*._.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..Why not? D:
<UxieLover> 11Privite matters
<DSD> 10?
<DSD> 10oh ok
<Cynder7> 6I think I'm going to have to re-install the whole thing.. ._.
<Cynder7> 6Oh
<DSD> 10whats the ts stand for?
<Cynder7> 6The Sims
<UxieLover> 11I refuse to know the names of all Sims (for now)
<UxieLover> 11A certain family will damage me
<Cynder7> 6What do you mean?
<DSD> 10$7.99 each, there will also be larger packs containing three characters.
<DSD> 10ok
<DSD> 10damn
<Cynder7> 6Gah..I really don't know if I should re-install the whole thing..
<UxieLover> 11Two years have gone by, and a family damaged my happiness.
<DSD> 10I'm going to need to sell a kidney
<Cynder7> 6D:
<DSD> 10i want Spyro Halo and MW3
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cynder7> 6I want Spyro and MW3 as well.. ._.
<DSD> 10yea the price of games
<UxieLover> 11I refuse to speak their names, or their hometown. It's a pre-made family that put a scar in my heart
<Cynder7> 6Including MW2,Black Ops and Brutal Legend..
<Cynder7> 6DDD:
<SilverSonic> ^_^
<SilverSonic> also AE, SC :B
*Cynder7 6makes a folder
<DSD> 10i have mw2 and Black ops
<DSD> 10http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=11202423 Uxie behind the goblin
<Cynder7> 6Atm I have CoD4 and the Black Ops demo.. ._.
<DSD> 10thats a canon characters
<Espeon> 06x3
<DSD> 10i need CoD4
<Espeon> 06Everybody wants some AE
<Cynder7> 6What's the red dragon at the end? :
<Cynder7> 6*:O
<DSD> 10not sure
<SilverSonic> yesh :3
<Cynder7> 6I wish CoD4 was compatible with Dualshock 3.. ._.
<DSD> 10if all of them are toys then theirs like 6 dragons
<Cynder7> 6I like the little skull dude on the right :3
<UxieLover> 11Goblin?
<Cynder7> 6Oh carp..I need to sort the A7x pics again..
<UxieLover> 11That's a red dragon. But what's his name, I wonder?
<DSD> 10not sure
<Soital> 12especially you ;o
*Soital runs
<DSD> 10hm
<UxieLover> 11There's only one female that is known: Stealf Elf
<DSD> 10is DS is a 3ds only character i need to get the 3ds and play him on the 360
<DSD> 10like $700 just for spyro
<UxieLover> 11The characters can be used for all versions
<DSD> 10and $800 for everything mw3 spyro and halo
<DSD> 10well some think DS will be a character that comes with the 3ds and thats the only way to get him
<UxieLover> 11Who knows
<UxieLover> 11When will ShouldWiki become editable again?
<UxieLover> 11I've already lost patiance
<DSD> 10http://kotaku.com/halo/ XD
<DSD> 10i'm not sure
<UxieLover> 11That's that?
<UxieLover> 11I think that by time they are finished, SSA would have already been released
<Cynder7> 6 800$? Wtf ? o.o
<DSD> 10yea
<DSD> 10yes
<Cynder7> 6Why?
<DSD> 10C7 watch the vid
<DSD> 10well
<UxieLover> 11$800?
<DSD> 10maybe around 500$
<DSD> 10well if the figures are 7$ each
<Cynder7> 6xD
<DSD> 10and 99 C
<UxieLover> 11I hope it will only cost around $500 in Australia
*SilverSonic catches
<Cynder7> 6:O 99?
<UxieLover> 11$7 in America
<DSD> 10and like 100$ for the game
<Cynder7> 6Is that offically how many there are?
<UxieLover> 11But in Australia, the price is normally higher, like around $12
<DSD> 10yes
<Cynder7> 6I'd say the game would be about 70-80..
<UxieLover> 11Maybe
<UxieLover> 11I can get all figs, unless it's more than $20 per fig
*DSD 10wants akilljoy like mc
<Cynder7> 6I'll probably only get the ones that come with the game..
<UxieLover> 11How many I'll get depends on the game's exitment
<Cynder7> 6Can you give me two three-digit numbers?
*Dermathil starts to write again.
<UxieLover> 11?
<Dman> yay~
<DSD> 10well it's not going to be cheap
<Cynder7> 6Like 555 or something.. :P
<DSD> 10maybe
<DSD> 10lets see
*Dermathil is immediately drawn off by another youtube video
<UxieLover> 11Might
<Dermathil> this shit is amazing
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-myMEB40Hg
<Cynder7> 6Basically the 555 was about the thing I said before.. :P
<DSD> 10$231.71
<DSD> 10thats for toys
<Espeon> 06Well... true enough
<Dermathil> so, Dman, why couldn't you participate to the D&D session that's begining to take shape with silvermane as the DM?
<DSD> 10say the game is 70 or up it will be about $300
<UxieLover> 11Yep
<Espeon> 06:3
<Cynder7> 6Meh.. .-.
<Dman> : /
<Dman> I needed to go to bed y/day
<Cynder7> 6I'll probably have to wait 5 years till the price goes down enough..
<Dman> how far in is it? (i mentioned it in the channel, but i've never played D&D, yet i've seen about 10 games before)
<Dermathil> Still in character creation.
<Dermathil> I'm the only real veteran player.
<UxieLover> 11Maybe, but the hatedom might put it to $5 (per figure) by this time next year
<Dermathil> I can roll multiple dies faster than Steven_Magnet can.
<Dman> Ah, maybe i'll be able to still play
*Dermathil pulls his dice pouch out
<Dman> that vid is quite funny
<Dermathil> yeah
<DSD> 10then it would be $171.73
<Dermathil> it was a trololol vid but it caught me completely off-guard
<Cynder7> 6I guess it's time to make copies and uninstall the game.. ._.
<Dman> haha same just now
<UxieLover> 11Okay
<Cynder7> 6This sucks so bad.. ._.
<DSD> 10which comes to about 250$
<Dermathil> btw, the guy who liked that vid on his youtube page is a let's player who has a machinima series. and just below that vid's like there's epic cupcakes time.
<Dermathil> (I think that LPer is a brony)
<Dermathil> (he also liked the fluttercussing vid)
<Dman> (sounds like a brony :P)
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/user/PaperBatVG#p/a/u/2/kFRGWo32aJg
<UxieLover> 11Just be very thankful you did not become over-addicted to one pre-made family like I did
<DSD> 10which is about 70
<Dermathil> he's canadian, too
<DSD> 10less
<RDash> Morning everypony
<DSD> 10oh thats right
<Cynder7> 6I wanna ask my friend about it but Idk what exactly to ask.. .-.
<Dermathil> hey RDash
<Dman> Mornin' RDash
<UxieLover> 11That nightmare is now a part of the darkness in my heart, which I hope will disappear forever, soon
<Cynder7> 6Meh..I usually tend to get kinda addicted..
<RDash> Hi Dermathil and Dman
<DSD> 10Darkness?
<Ziltoid> Oh hai
<Cynder7> 6What I really hate is when I do a whole lot of stuff and then the game decides to crash and close down so I lose everything I've done.. ._.
<Dermathil> hey Ziltoid. I'm on #ponies&Dragons btw
<RDash> The fluttercussing video isnt that bad at the beginning :P
<Dman> and hey there Ziltoid
<Dman> Dermathil - i didn't know that
<Ziltoid> alright
<RDash> Hey Ziltoid
<UxieLover> 11Yeah, tha's a nightmare
<DSD> 10But I've learned... that deep down there's a light that never goes out!
<RDash> The voice matches fluttershy's mouth exactly
<UxieLover> 11That's right! But I sure wish I could free that light
<Dman> I think it's hillarious
<RDash> Word
<RDash> Adjective
<Cynder7> 6I had this other evil happen on Infamous 2..I accidently overwrote the wrong file..Now I lost whatever I had done in that file and I had done pretty much everything.. ._.
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dman> Yo, Uh. Word. Adjective. Pronoun. Adverb.. Run on and on and on.. Where my gerunds at? . Parenthetical, uh.
<Dman> And then the cussing begins
<DSD> 10Darkness is the heart's true essence.
<RDash> Haha, yea
<Cynder7> 6I want Cheetos..
<UxieLover> 11WARNING: This is the reason why I lost my love for the Pride Lands
<UxieLover> 11There is an unknown history connecting all this
<Cynder7> 6Lol.Now it's copying all the custom content I've downloaded.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<DSD> 10unknown i know
<Cynder7> 6My friend's not answering.. ._.
<UxieLover> 11This family destroyed me, and I was only 14. The Pride Lands played a small, but important role in this
<Cynder7> 6I think I'll get some A7x on the radio..
<UxieLover> 11I refuse to state who, or why, this happened
<Cynder7> 6What are the Pride Lands?
<DSD> 10Uxie if you want to tell her i

<DSD> 10ill back you up

<Dermathil> they don't make lotteries anymore, remember?
<Dermathil> I mena
<Dermathil> they don'T make a list in ponychan for the names in the lottery
<Dermathil> *mean
<Dman> I know there's no lotteries, but there's still /chan/ threads
<Dman> suggestions etc
<Dman> and I know, now they take all the active members in the bronystate channel
<Dman> I was there, as were you ^_^, when they announced this
<Dman> I just can't find their ponychan thread
<UxieLover> 11DSD?
<Dermathil> ah
<Cynder7> 6I bet my friend thinks it's something important now.. xP

<Cynder7> 6Freedom to be bored ftw?
<DSD> 10october 16th for the us
<UxieLover> 11Okay!
<Dman> hey ziltoid, dermathil, why not write a fanfic based on the D&D game here at bronystate?
<UxieLover> 11So, I wonder why some people think Darkness should be destroyed?
<Cynder7> 6Is it the same for EU as well or a bit later?
<UxieLover> 11I think it cannot be destroyed
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Dermathil> it isn't with ponies, so it would be a probably useless idea IMO
<Dermathil> hey RBD
<Dman> Oh, it's Rainbrodash
<Cynder7> 0...*sighs* I wish Icy was here...
<RDash> Ohai there Rainbrodash
<Cynder7> 6Hooray for invisible writing!
<Cynder7> 6._.
<Cynder7> 6Hey
<Shadow_Wolf> hello
<Cynder7> 6*sighs*
<UxieLover> 11Shadow Wolf?
<Spy_DSD> I never really was on your team
<Cynder7> 6Tf?
<Spy_DSD> yes
<UxieLover> 11?
<Spy_DSD> May I make a suggestion?
<UxieLover> 11What?
<Spy_DSD> Run
<DSD> 10what sucks is we can't change a lot of the templates
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Dermathil> brb later
<drf-Droid> o.o?
<ValtheJean> morning gentlecolts
<Dman> c ya
<Dman> oh Hey there ValtheJean
<Ascendant> I hate essays
<ValtheJean> howdy Dman
<Dman> howdy
<Ascendant> lol PO crashed
<ValtheJean> I'd like to go on record that Google Chrome is a malicious bastard who's sole purpose is to torment me
<Dman> : /
<Dman> Chrome's almost mai waifu, so why's that?
<Sneas> 03iiiiiiiiiiii
<Dman> what's up with you and Chrome?
<ValtheJean> well
<ValtheJean> I'm trying to make a theme for Sathi
<ValtheJean> but the damn template wont let me adjust images and whatnot
<ValtheJean> it just loops them like a complete retard
<Dman> : /
<ValtheJean> so I have to manually adjust image sizes for it to fit
<ValtheJean> the problem: is that if you use a different resolution, or have a larger monitor than me, it fails miserably
<UxieLover> 11That's true
<ValtheJean> raaarwwrwrgfgjlkdsgpfogl;
<Dman> and that's what bad themes have : / good themes have that featureythingy where any resolution works
<ValtheJean> yeah
<ValtheJean> which is why Google Chrome is purposefully tormenting me
<Dman> : /
<DSD> 10maybe
<DSD> 10i don't know
<DSD> 10it seems we are working ourselves done
<ValtheJean> that was weird...
<ValtheJean> anyone else have that chat crash?
<UxieLover> 11We might
<DSD> 10*Down
<UxieLover> 11At least TTE is still active at Bulbapedia, sometimes
<Dman> not me
<Dman> it happens sometimes to somepeople
<Dman> happened to me before
<RDash> ohai ValtheJean Not to me
<ValtheJean> weird
<ValtheJean> howdy RDash
<RDash> FireFox ftw
<RDash> :P
<ValtheJean> agreed
<ValtheJean> stupid chrome being stupid...and evil
<DSD> 10yea
<UxieLover> 11Maybe we should only contact him when we need an admin's help.
<UxieLover> 11Currently, we need to create pages and gather images ready for SSA
<DSD> 10yes but a lot of it is locked for admins only
<UxieLover> 11Some templates are not needed to be edited yet
<Dman> :/ I prefer Chrome still
<lighty> Yay! Almost home from sailing trip :3
<UxieLover> 11The one for the worlds does, as it's not been updated for Spyro: A Hero's Tail
<Dermathil> alright back

<DSD> 10idk
<DSD> 10i'm not sure
<UxieLover> 11Maybe we should just leave a message on his talkpage, then wait seven days for a reply?
<DSD> 10or we edit like crazy then ask for admins
<UxieLover> 11?
<DSD> 10like i said

<Dermathil> You can't be serious. That title belongs to Fallout: Equestria!
<Dermathil> 35chapters and counting!
<RDash> It's quality, not quantity! 13 chapters and counting
<RDash> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-past-sins.html
<RDash> Wait, how long are the chapter then, eh?
<Dermathil> But Fallout: Equestria is both Quality AND Quantity!
<Dermathil> (in general the FO:E chapters are over 10K words each)
<UxieLover> 11Do you like Simpsons?
<Dermathil> and it currently is the most popular post in the EqD sidebar.
<Dermathil> No other fic is in there.
<UxieLover> 11Just wondering, as I found some episodes online
<RDash> Check two posts down
<Dermathil> derp
<RDash> lol
<Dermathil> herpyderpderp
<RDash> Sonic Rainderp
<Dermathil> I just noticed something in the season 2 screenies post: the 2nd picture has, on the right monitor, the very same post on EqD (recogniseable due to the 1st picture being seen in that screen)
<Dermathil> That thread is a ponyception in Apocalyptic sizes
<RDash> Yea, in the twitter post they said "Us looking at us"
<Ziltoid> <mfw theres an for add for an amusement park on my banana
<lightumbreon> 06i'm away for 8 little days
<Dermathil> lol
<lightumbreon> 06and THIS:
<lightumbreon> 06http://www.speedtest.net/result/1417319545.png
<RDash> 0.0 I wonder how that advertizing method is working for that park?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Reminds me of my connection speed
*Dermathil wonders if Silvermane will show up before 7PM EST tonight. Silvermane is a D&D DM for a brony campaign!
<lightumbreon> 06not cool, my speed is 20 Mb/s, and im above 120% FASTER then the average of NL
<ValtheJean> O_o
<lightumbreon> 06router and modem need a reset
<ValtheJean> a brony DnD game?????
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> me gusta....
<RDash> Yep, its over at #ponies&dragons
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: it is just a normal D&D game with bronies who are the players.
<lightumbreon> 06BBL, resetting bthat darn thing >.>
<Espeon> 06.-.
<ValtheJean> what ruleset do you guys use?
<Dermathil> the 3.5
<ValtheJean> wewt
<ValtheJean> that's the best one
<Dermathil> (I am happy it isn't 4.0)
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Espeon> 06how is that connection in the top 7% o.o
<Dermathil> Silvermane's the DM, but I am the only Veteran D&D player who'S gonna be a player right now
<ValtheJean> so can anyone jump in, or is there a sign up sort of thing?
<Dermathil> we are still at the character creation phase
<Dermathil> (I also discovered yesterday that I got a slew of AD&D books)
<ValtheJean> >is totally going to ask silver if I can join >.<
<Dermathil> you also a vet player?
*dubtrotmaster is wondering when we will hear the rest of that story
<ValtheJean> yeah
<RainBroDash> 10>has never played DnD >.>
<ValtheJean> DM'd a few times
<Dermathil> nice.
<ValtheJean> it's REALLY fun RainBrodash
<RainBroDash> 10I know, I've seen it happen
<ValtheJean> I think my favorite character I made:
<Dermathil> I be the human cleric, btw.
<Dermathil> Also, we all be lvl 1
<ValtheJean> he was a human Samurai with REALLY low Strength and Constitution scores
<dubtrotmaster> wait who was on this morning
<ValtheJean> but, he had really high Dexterity and Charisma
<prince-dari> Why do so many bronies do DnD?
<ValtheJean> so he was basically assigned the role as our group's representative
<dubtrotmaster> were nerds
<Dermathil> D0rky stuff?
<Dermathil> Dubtrotmaster got it right.
<ValtheJean> BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
<prince-dari> Also, it's not really a game is it? It's just RPing, right?
<ValtheJean> depends
<ValtheJean> it depends on how you WANT to play it
<Dermathil> prince-dari: it is a game. You actually got fights.
<RainBroDash> 10>papercraft spitfire
<RainBroDash> 10WANT
<prince-dari> How do you have fights...
<Dermathil> dice rolls
*dubtrotmaster want to know when will we be able to hear the rest of that story dari?????
<RainBroDash> 10and dari it's a game in the same way a text based MMO is a game, but inb4 you don't call that a game
<ValtheJean> lol, well I could go into the entire details of initiative and whatnot, but it's just turn based combat
<Dermathil> ^^
<prince-dari> It's different, that's automated, preset story and everything.
<prince-dari> This is people making up a story and acting it out through text.
<ValtheJean> lol, what did you think people did without computers?
<ValtheJean> they rolled dice
<Dermathil> prince-dari: you haven'T seen some of the complex dungeons my old DM did.
<Dermathil> Remember when I spoke of the movie CUBE?
<ValtheJean> most modern rpg's today are just computer generated die-rolls
<Dermathil> My old DM made a dungeon based off that movie.
<dubtrotmaster> friendship is sexy is very nice....just sayin
<Ziltoid> DnD is like, totally ,like black magic man
<ValtheJean> oh man, anyone ever played World of Darkness?
<Dermathil> not that I know of.
<ValtheJean> that game, is fucking epic
<ValtheJean> basically
<Dermathil> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/ (the movie I'm speaking of that my old DM made a dungeon based off of)
<ValtheJean> it's dnd, but with vampires
<ValtheJean> they even made a video game based off of it
<Dermathil> he had simplified it alot, but even then we were stuck for a whole IRL day.
<ValtheJean> (Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines)
<Dermathil> AH
<Dermathil> rings a bell then.
<Dermathil> I may have played a game of it once.
<ValtheJean> it's REALLY memorable
<Dermathil> But it was a short game.
<ValtheJean> because there's a lot less emphasis on die-rolls and pure stats
<ValtheJean> the abilities are much more generalized and open for interpretation
<ValtheJean> so basically, you can do all sorts of crazy shit if you're clever enough
<Dermathil> Valthejean: makes me think of a marvel paper rpg I played once.
<ValtheJean> don't think I've played a marvel rpg, but it sounds like it could be good
<Dermathil> you was a super hero and you could use your chosen powers any way you wanted as long as it fit within the vaguely described powers.
<Dermathil> For example, you got an air manipulation power? Alright, make a bubble around an enemy's head, remove all the air from the bubble.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Barry> Hi
<ValtheJean> yeah, that's kind of like the stuff you could pull off in WoD
<ValtheJean> howdy Barry
<Ziltoid> hello barry
<Barry> How are you guys?
<ValtheJean> not too bad, how about yourself?
<Barry> I'm doing good
<Dermathil> (I had elemental manipulations in that marvel RPG (which used colored stones as power points that you had to spend each turn to decide what strength your use would be)
<Dermathil> So my character manipulated air, water, earth and fire.
<ValtheJean> hehe...avatar
<Dermathil> And with manipulation came changing body into an elemental.
<Dermathil> think you can turn into a puddle of water while sneaking in a place.
<Barry> I was watching a Dr. Who episode yesterday, and I noticed that if the Doctor is killed in the middle of his regeneration cycle, it's disrupted, and the cycle breaks
<SheenaFox> But I just joined chat D:
<Ziltoid> youre on season 5?
<Dermathil> Or, for even sneakier infiltration, turn into a gust of air.
<Barry> BBC America on Demand has the first 5 episodes of what they call Season 6
<Barry> which isn't due to air until late August
<Ziltoid> thats what I meant season 6
<ValtheJean> is it me...or does anyone miss the good old days of THACO?
<Ziltoid> derp
<Barry> THACO?
<ValtheJean> ToHitArmorClassZero
<Ziltoid> I love tacos
<Barry> ahh
<ValtheJean> it's a device from DnD 2.0
<Barry> @roll 1 12
<Steven_Magnet> 6Barry rolls a 6

<Barry> Not bad

<Espeon> 06awesome
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1417362915.png
<NewDCD> 9It's a fictional food
<NewDCD> 9from a game from MGS's creator, Hideo Kojima
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's actually a bit higher than it normally is
<lightumbreon> 06www.speedtest.net/result/1417363221
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<NewDCD> 9the game is called Snatcher
<lightumbreon> 06www.speedtest.net/result/1417363221.png
<NewDCD> 9those who have tried it says it's pretty good
<Espeon> 06I just want your ping LU then I'm
<Espeon> 06set
<Espeon> 06:3
<lightumbreon> 06that is on my other PC
<lightumbreon> 06WITH lan cables.....
<Sneas> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Espeon> 06Lol
<SheenaFox> Ro-ro-ro-roara
<lightumbreon> 06and Espeon....honestly....i dont even know what that is xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Roaraaaaaa :D
*lightumbreon runs
<NewDCD> 9and I streamed Snatcher here a few weeks ago
<Denied_Existence> What kind of pizza and what kind of soup?
<Dermathil> I remember that
<Aurora> !Espeon
<Espeon> 06LU what
*Espeon now belongs to Aurora for 11 minutes
<Aurora> !Angel_Espeon
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :P
<Aurora> <3
<Espeon> 06:3
<lightumbreon> 06seriously Xeli,,,,,i NEVER heard what a PING is or so.... never worked with it, so i dont have a clue
<Denied_Existence> ooohhhh....miso soup...yum...
<Denied_Existence> That actually sounds interesting
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't know what a ping is, either
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Espeon> 06ping is basically response time, in games high ping = lag
<NewDCD> 9it can actually be made with different combinations
<lightumbreon> 06my ping used to be 0
*lightumbreon flees
<Ascendant> I'm going to bed
<Espeon> 06Night
<Espeon> 06<3
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to try Chicken Noodle + Combination Pizza cause I'm poor
<lightumbreon> 06BEFORE THIS PIECE OF SHIZZZ DECIDED TO DIE ON ME >.<
<lightumbreon> 06night NS :3
<NewDCD> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BMybKPY1GE
<Ascendant> it's 3:30am xD
<Espeon> 06lol LU your ping is appearently 0 secs, but the ctcp ping probably doesn't count anything smaller than seconds
<Denied_Existence> You can get some Miso soup cheaply
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight Ascendant :3
<Denied_Existence> Just go by an asian restaurant/fast food place
<Espeon> 06also lol 34 ping .w.
<NewDCD> 9none in my area
<Aurora> ...lol
<NewDCD> 9well, not that sell Miso Soup at least
<Denied_Existence> Wantan soup might work
<Ascendant> o-o
<NewDCD> 9I think I'll go with Chicken Wonton Soup
<NewDCD> 9I think I have some of that Campbell's Soup
<lightumbreon> 06hey Xeli, if i'll CTCP Ray with his Winternetz when he's back in Venezuela....can i laugh?
<Espeon> 06I assume the winternets are sarcastic? :P
<Denied_Existence> now I suddenly have a craving for some Pei-Wei
<lightumbreon> 06Ray's idea :D
<Ascendant> I had 2 minutes and 43 seconds lag yesterday
<Ascendant> even ask SilverSonic
<Espeon> 06lol
<lightumbreon> 06i had a 10 Minute lag once
<lightumbreon> 06but then i realised
<lightumbreon> 06my router needed to make place for another
<lightumbreon> 06:3
<lightumbreon> 06Netgear? NEVER take a netgear router >:
*Angel_Espeon has a netgear router
<Link> !sneas !umbreon !espeon
*Sneas now belongs to Link for 34 minutes
*Espeon still belongs to Aurora for 3 more minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to Link for 13 minutes
<lightumbreon> 06...
*lightumbreon sneaks away
<Espeon> 06a better way to sum up ping is basically
<Espeon> 06have low ping
<Espeon> 06you WILL do well in CoD
*Espeon hides
<lightumbreon> 06xD
<lightumbreon> 06i never play Cod
<Angel_Espeon> 13Cod is a fish
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Denied_Existence> Such a striking difference in what we are doing this morning versus what we were doing late last night.
<Espeon> 06the lag compensation is on crack or something
<lightumbreon> 06only multiplayer would be Starcraft2 and TF2
<Espeon> 06if you get host (console-wise) you could as well be lagswitching
<Espeon> 06And I rarely do myself, sometimes I do though. Mostly tf2 and lazy though
<lightumbreon> 06hm
<lightumbreon> 06i HAVE a LAN-Cable inserted....but it says i only have local acsess >.<
<RDash> Haha, ya D_E
<SilverSonic> ahh i see i've been nickalerted :P
<Asterisk> !espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Aurora for 17 more seconds
<lightumbreon> 06[19:25:56] <%Ascendant> even ask SilverSonic
<lightumbreon> 06[19:30:09] <SilverSonic> ahh i see i've been nickalerted :P

<RDash> Morning makes me saner although that's not saying much
<lightumbreon> 06[19:31:02] [SilverSonic PING reply]: 1sec
<lightumbreon> 06:3
<SilverSonic> lol
<SilverSonic> hardly any lag :p
<lightumbreon> 06my lag is 18ms...
<lightumbreon> 06hm...
<lightumbreon> 06but my other PC has a lag of 6ms....
<lightumbreon> 06LAN-Cables FTW
<SilverSonic> i doubt ill ever play TF2
<SilverSonic> because this laptop is craaaaaaaaaaaaaap
<Angel_Espeon> 13craptop? :3
<SilverSonic> lol well, steam + my laptop dont really mix well
<SilverSonic> PLUS, Im missing an Up arrow key
<lightumbreon> 06replace it with a corn bit
*lightumbreon runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13How is it possible to lose keys on a keyboard? o-o
<SilverSonic> they break off?
<Espeon> 06I could make your TF2 so minimalistic graphics wise that it would make you feel like a hipster
*Espeon diesd
<lightumbreon> 06nooo!
<lightumbreon> 06dead floof!
*lightumbreon does CPR on Espoen
<SilverSonic> LOL just turn TF2 into an 8-Bit game
<lightumbreon> 06*Espeon
*SilverSonic shot
<lightumbreon> 06>.>
<Angel_Espeon> 13How can they break off though, when you're lightly pressing down on them while typing o-o
<SilverSonic> cleaning the keyboard?
<Denied_Existence> Heh, only you, I, and a few others here have any idea...
<Espeon> 06once happened to me but I had gotten something stuck behind the key and getting that thing away didn't end well =w=
<Denied_Existence> MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Denied_Existence> Or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13Just wipe the keyboard with a cloth? |D
<Aurora> 6http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/216/6/6/eevers_by_coconutmilkyway-d45520s.jpg
<lightumbreon> 06o got special equipement for cleaning my Keyboard!
<Ascendant> now goodnight for real
<lightumbreon> 06you know...toothbrush...paper....towels....clothing....
<Angel_Espeon> 13But if you're careful, the keyboard will hardly ever get dirty to begin with |D
<lightumbreon> 06but i eat cookies all the time
<lightumbreon> 06how can i keep my Keyboard clean then?
<SilverSonic> XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I eat food at my computer all the time too, I just keep the food away from the keyboard and wipe my hands before typing :B

<NewDCD> 9>mfw I upload the new chapter before the update for past chapter is up in EqD
<NewDCD> 9>mfw nobody cares anyways because my fic is not very well rated xD
*RDash did not know you had a fic
<RDash> Linkers?
<ValtheJean> I'd offer to support you, but I cannot abide the honorable name of Caramel to be placed in fanfics :P
<NewDCD> 9b-but Val
<NewDCD> 9is it really that bad to have badass Caramel in a story?
<ValtheJean> I WILL NOT ABIDE THE CORRUPTION OF CARAMEL!
<ValtheJean> However awesome Kamen Riders are :P
<Denied_Existence> ...
<NewDCD> 9I'm surprised you're bothered about that and not by I-matured-a-lot-in-three-year's-time Snails
<NewDCD> 9also RDash: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/story-wyburn.html Act 04 is already in my dA
<ValtheJean> hey hey, let's get one thing straight here :P
<ValtheJean> I dislike all fanfics in general
<NewDCD> 9the unlabeled chapter, "Wyburn", is an optional prequel
<RDash> Ah, thanks
<ValtheJean> hence why I am so protective of my husabando appearing in one :P
<NewDCD> 9then it wouldn't be technically disliking fanfics, but more like
<NewDCD> 9"I don't read them"
<RDash> But ValtheJean, don't you want Caramel to be famous? That's his lifelong dream
<ValtheJean> He is a content pony who tries to live a normal life!
<ValtheJean> He wasn't meant for such things!
<NewDCD> 9TOO BAD FOR YOU I HUMANIZED HIM FOR THE SAKE OF THIS FIC : 3c
<NewDCD> 9AND I ALSO DREW HIM
<ValtheJean> O_o

<ValtheJean> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<RDash> ^XD
<NewDCD> 9>YFW I ship that
*NewDCD 9COMEATMEBRO-faces
<ValtheJean> O_o
<ValtheJean> homicidal....urges....rising
*Denied_Existence takes the rabies vaccine from RDash and loads it into a dart gun.
*Denied_Existence shoots ValtheJean with the dart gun.
<NewDCD> 9but really
*Dermathil heads off to FO:NV
<Denied_Existence> EXTREME MEDICATION
<ValtheJean> VALTHEJEAN SMASH
<NewDCD> 9I thought you'd dig humanized Caramel
<NewDCD> 9or.....are you ponysexual?
*NewDCD 9trollfaces even harder than before.
<RDash> lol
<ValtheJean> nah, I *really* dislike humanized versions of the ponies
*Denied_Existence loads the dart gun with sedatives.
<ValtheJean> it just feels weird to me
*RDash agrees
<ValtheJean> kinda creeps me out honestly
*Denied_Existence shoots ValtheJean with the sedative dart.
<ValtheJean> hey bro! I'm calm!
<ValtheJean> YOUR DARTS ONLY FURTHER MY ANGER
*Denied_Existence shoots ValtheJean with another sedative dart.
*RDash shoots ValtheJean with Caramel pics
<NewDCD> 9*shrug* In my fic, there are two worlds. When humans go into Equestria, they turn into ponies, and if ponies go into the human world, they turn into humans. And so on.
<RDash> http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/131032024617-sizemattersnot.png
<ValtheJean> CARAMEL DOES NOT SHIP, HE'S A GOOD PONY. HE HAS A TWIN SISTER
*NewDCD 9calls this "Law of Conservation of Dominant Species."
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> YOU SON OF A BITCH
<ValtheJean> YU NO DISGLACE MAI HUSABANDO
<NewDCD> 9IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY SOMEWHAT PRAUSIBRE BLO
*RDash wants to go into Equestria to turn into a pony
*Denied_Existence loads a flash drive containing caramel clop fiction into his drive gun.
<NewDCD> 9well, more like "SCIENCE-FICTIONALLY" plausible, but yeah
<Denied_Existence> DONT MAKE ME USE THIS
<ValtheJean> err sorry, that was aimed at RDash, not you DCD
<NewDCD> 9OH U
<ValtheJean> Denied, I would like to mention that should you do such a thing, there is no force in the entire galaxy that can stop the homicidal purge I would begin
<NewDCD> 9.....
<RDash> Wait, did you say Caramel is your husband
*RDash is serious
<ValtheJean> Husabando
<ValtheJean> (male version of waifu)
*Denied_Existence reloads his guns
<RDash> 0.0
<Denied_Existence> ...
<ValtheJean> hey man, I'm gar for Caramel
<RDash> @pony ValtheJean's waifu
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ValtheJean's waifu is 5A8ce
<RDash> Muahaha, Caramel isn't on @pony yet
<ValtheJean> I call falacy on this because Steven's database hasn't been updated to include Caramel
<Denied_Existence> NewDCD, my theory is when we die, the energy from our brains is released and reaches above-light speeds
*NewDCD 9makes a Caramel sock puppet....
<RDash> YES!^
<ValtheJean> @NewDCD *SQUEEEEEEEE*
*NewDCD 9then proceeds to make him the Village Bicycle http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/d5ab5bdf43b735afce8a883a07ef71e8/29470%20-%20applejack%20coolface%20fluttershy%20mane_six%20pinkie_pie%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20template%20trollface%20twilight_sparkle%20u_mad.png
<Denied_Existence> Thereby, the brain-waves can then jump through the 9th dimension
<ValtheJean> ....
<ValtheJean> I WILL FEED YOUR GALL BLADDER TO MY CAT
<RDash> Denied_Existence And into Ponyville?!?
<NewDCD> 9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_thumbs/2e3e576711bf5ad8cdf302bed48da093/thumb.jpg
<RDash> :D
<ValtheJean> fyi, if NewDCD is suddenly "not available" tomorrow, you'll all know why
<Denied_Existence> When our brainwaves jump through the 9th dimension, they reappear in a universe completely different from our own
<Denied_Existence> This continues into infinity
<Denied_Existence> Therefore, yes, you might eventually wind up in equestrian.
<Denied_Existence> Equestria.
<RDash> Denied_Existence 'might' is not good enough
<Denied_Existence> Well...you will be doing this an INFINITE amount of time
<Denied_Existence> 's
<RDash> But infinity is too long to wait!
<RDash> @meter Chance RDash will make it to Equestria
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Chance RDash will make it to Equestria is 6% . (1170)
<RDash> Oh NO!
<Denied_Existence> Well...then we have to factor the possibility of a 'god' into the equation.
<RainBroDash> 10>implying god exists
<RainBroDash> 10:trollface:
<ValtheJean> andherewego.gif
<RainBroDash> 10^ :P
<Denied_Existence> If there is a "God" then it is possibility that "god" is controlling the flow.
<RainBroDash> 10;_______________;
<Denied_Existence> We are doing this scientifically man!
<prince-dari> [18:52] <ValtheJean> IF HE SULLIED THE GOOD NAME OF CARAMEL I AM GOING TO SKIN HIM ALIVE AND THEN WEAR HIS COAT
<prince-dari> That's next on my list bro.
<prince-dari> ;)
<ValtheJean> O_o
<NewDCD> 9no seriously guys no religious stuff. That's an inevitable shitstorm
<Denied_Existence> We are determining the likeliness of your brainwaves jumping into a pony universe!
<Denied_Existence> This is purely science!
<ValtheJean> I warn you Dari...none of my enemies are alive
<ValtheJean> oh wait...except one
<RainBroDash> 10Dari. SilverMane started a ColgatexCaramel fic a couple days ago in silvershipper, wanna read it? :3
<NewDCD> 9you can't kill me
<ValtheJean> that reminds me...I should probably feed him
<Denied_Existence> DO IT
<NewDCD> 9because
<NewDCD> 9UNLIKE PEOPLE
<ValtheJean> it's been a few months
<NewDCD> 9WHO DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED
<NewDCD> 9I LIVE WHEN I AM KILLED
<prince-dari> Only if ValtheJean is here to listen.

<VioletVanilla> Silence. . . The eerie feeling of loneliness crept into Dash's mind as she went about her day. All of Ponyville had been bustling during the early afternoon, but by now it had dwindled.

<lightumbreon> 06SCALIE!
<lightumbreon> 06i mean
<lightumbreon> 06hi Glacymr
<VioletVanilla> She was moving clouds in position, getting ready for a light shower in the afternoon, something the mayor had requested be done so as the spring flowers could begin blooming.

<VioletVanilla> Smoothing out the last wrinkle into a stray stratus, Dash positioned it over Sugarcube Corner. The lights that shone from inside caught her eye, pulling her mind away from the duty at hand. Uproarious cheers and laughter rang out from the big pink bakery.
<SilverSonic> ;D
<SilverSonic> Link = SS :P

<VioletVanilla> *Oh that Pinkie Pie, I don't understand how she could throw so many parties!* She shook her head, *If I spent that much time having fun I'd never even have a chance at being the best flier in all of Equestria!*
<Espeon> 06Is there a variable for each of those bullet things, because then I'd understand if your computer blew up
*Espeon dies again
<VioletVanilla> She gave a look of pride, whipping her main around in a swoop of bright colors. *As I AM the best. . .*

<VioletVanilla> Which story Pegacorn?
<Dashite_Clone> Whoa, my head hurts...

<DeniedExistence> WE DONT NEED MULTIPLE CLONES OF YOU
*Dashite stomps the cloning machine to bits
<RobotPinkie> What happens if you fuck with a cloning machine?
<RobotPinkie> What would the offspring look like?
<Pattyrick> Like uploading Fb photos and deviations
*DeniedExistence sighs.
<Pegacorn> ThE ClOnNiNg MaChInE Is DeAd.
<Pegacorn> (lol GlaDOS)
<Dashite> The offspring would look exactly like you.
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw that fic with all the rainbow dashes
<RobotPinkie> So it wouldn't result in a bunch of tiny cloning machines, I guess.
<Dashite> Multiple dashes?
<RainBroDash> 10>the image of a new world. A beautiful world.
<RainBroDash> 10Dashite: Multiple dashes.

*Pegacorn pulls out the Spy's Ambassador and tries to shoot himself
<Pattyrick> Hi Ascendant =D
<Denied_Existence> I am still connected right?
<Dashite> Nope. You left a long time ago.
<Denied_Existence> Har har har
<RobotPinkie> Just a question. If I get a purple custom FiM T-shirt made, and I wear it to work, does that make me an attention horse?
<Denied_Existence> Anyway, what is this about MULTIPLE RAINBOW DASH'S?
<HyperMetalLugia> Cable companies are EVIL
<Denied_Existence> And I just lost connection AGAIN
<Pegacorn> RobotPinkie,yes it does.

<NightSeas> 12Netflix always wins
<HyperMetalLugia> And direct TCV sounds stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew netflix
<HyperMetalLugia> We can't use that either :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So Cable or GTFO locally .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or Wireless/WoW
<Denied_Existence> Now....it seems my connection is stable
<VioletVanilla> ;D
<Pegacorn> i'm back
<NightSeas> 12LOL, netflix is used through the internet XD
<RobotPinkie> I work in a comic book store, btw. People regularly wear various animation and comic book themed shirts.
<Denied_Existence> So...for like the third time...what were we talking about?
<HyperMetalLugia> NS, netflix BLOCKS BDA lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Like all other streaming companies :|
<NightSeas> 12Really? lol
<HyperMetalLugia> (No iPlayer, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime TV)

<Pattyrick> Hi Dakota
<RobotPinkie> Well, referring to the shirts, though it's certainly true for both.
<Dashite> Why?
<RobotPinkie> Why what?

<Dermathil> Gundam
<D_man> and dermathil google gurren lagann - it's anime style, but fukken awesome animashun
*NewDCD 9resists the desire to slap your shit. Gurren Lagann was great, but it wasn't the greatest mech series in history.
<Dermathil> >mfw I never watched any mech series before
<D_man> NewDCD i'm an anime noob - bear this in mind. Now - Teach me!
<NewDCD> 9I meant Dman. NOW LOOK AT THE OTHER ROBOTS TEACH HIM HOW IT'S DONE.
<RobotPinkie> >yfw I hated Evangelion
<prince-dari> Are the transformers cartoons the greatest mech series in history?
<sotha> I thought Code Geass was completely ridiculous.
<Pegacorn> My internet dun derped.Now i'm back.
<prince-dari> >trollestiaface.jpg
<D_man> FFUUUUU
<NewDCD> 9Evangelion is overrated, Gurren Lagann was a hilarous trainwreck but awesome to watch, ect.
<GGgala> well Geass sucks
<Tacowiz> I have a Killer Tomatoes poster hanging up in this very room.
<sotha> It was just the first thing I thought of for some reason
<NewDCD> 9I like Geass, but like how we like DeathStalker and Battlefield Earth
<Tacowiz> I want to request a really weird cartoon for us to watch.
<dubtrotmaster> why arent we watching gundam seed or gundam zero?
<D_man> I've seen like 10 animes only, but maria holic was teh lulz
<RobotPinkie> >yfw I enjoyed Brain Powered
<NewDCD> 9>Gundam Seed
<Tacowiz> Let's watch Return to the Planet of the Apes.

<sotha> I like Geass, but only because of how overly theatrical everything is.
<D_man> tacowiz oh you
<RobotPinkie> lol who should get out?
<NewDCD> 9Brain Powered was great
<sotha> As an actual show, no
<GGgala> I liked Eva and Gundam Wing, Gundam 00 took too long to do anything interesting
<Pegacorn> Hey D_man,are you gonna gift me L4D2 or not?
<NewDCD> 9Gundam Seed? more like Gundam SHIT. and Gundam SHIT DENSITY.
<D_man> Pegacorn - rah't nao?

<D_man> I can't till at least tomorrow pega
<NewDCD> 9...Shinn was actually a good protagonist, though.
<D_man> gotta put money on my card if you want L4D2
<RobotPinkie> I liked Gundam Wing, though, is that heresy?
<NewDCD> 9TOO BAD KIRA IS TOO MUCH OF A MARY SUE
<NewDCD> 9eh, Gundam Wing was lackluster
<NewDCD> 9but it's not terrible

<Ascendant`> since they started using unity instead of gnome as the desktop environment
<drf|laptop> 039.04 is the last good ubuntu, IMHO
<drf|laptop> 03which i still use

<DeniedExistence> I request you play some more Cthulhu
<D_man> i odn't know eureka 7

<D_man> :P i see
<NewDCD> 9that said
<NewDCD> 9I remember my friend spoiled me
<NewDCD> 9because this game is split in...well, two games
<D_man> nadie save lo que he puesto \o/ muahaha
<NewDCD> 9the second hasn't been released yet
<NewDCD> 9but at the end of this one, they show a preview for the next
<D_man> two games?
<D_man> so thisis recent?
<NewDCD> 9apparently Adult!Simon starts calling Ryoma "Aniki"

<D_man> Or is this teh QQ about the jewcreators who won't make 2nd game?
<NewDCD> 9This is "Break The World" Chapter
<NewDCD> 9no
<NewDCD> 9it's because the game is massive
<NewDCD> 9this here is 52+ scenarios
<NewDCD> 9plus route splits
<NewDCD> 9that means this game's story has at least 100 scenarios
<D_man> de magicks
<NewDCD> 9or stages if you may
<GGgala> soMuchContent.jpg
<D_man> somuchwin.gif
<Barry> 104 actually, if each scenario has a route split
<D_man> NewDCD out of very large curiosity - do you play with your computer screen or your PSP screen?
<NewDCD> 9PSP screen
<NewDCD> 9there is no PSP emulator
<D_man> Thanks
<NewDCD> 9but if you mean what I look at
<NewDCD> 9then both

<NightSeas> 12How so? lol
<D_man> NewDCD - i only recognise like 2 or 3 of those mechas but I imagine the feel of having a team of all those heroes at your command is uncomparable!
<NewDCD> 9(Wall's Effect: all attacks on this unit do 1/4th of the damage during the present turn)
<NewDCD> 9pretty much

<D_man> who is the boss btw?
<D_man> new for game?
<NewDCD> 9it's just a rough estimate
<NewDCD> 9yeah, a Banpresto Original
<D_man> w00t
<D_man> best when they use original enemies
<D_man> then it makes sence they can take em all on

<NewDCD> 9.....that's a high as fuck hit rate. Better try and defend
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just had a laughing fit over Peas
<Ziltoid> its the way to be
<Denied_Existence> OH SHEEET

<Denied_Existence> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/361.jpg
<NewDCD> 9Attack lets you choose the attack you will retaliate with btw
<D_man> is defend like guarranteed less damage but dodge a chance of complete miss or hit?
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLperverts
<NewDCD> 9D_man: Dodge cuts a hit percentage by about half if it's not so high
<NewDCD> 9but in this case it would probably lower it tilll
<D_man> oh ok
<NewDCD> 9.....66% hit chance or so
<NewDCD> 9....hmm
<NewDCD> 9I noticed something
<D_man> : /

<drf|laptop> 03kthx
<FlutterHi> lol
<ValtheJean> It's the greatest attack ever
<FlutterHi> :)
*Denied_Existence builds a mechanized suit out of Tungusken
<ValtheJean> Laguna said so :P
<FlutterHi> :)
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<NewDCD> 9look in youtube for "Asakim All Attacks" if you want to spoil yourself
<D_man> tiny mecha
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> I think we all know the truth behind this scandal ;)
<Quanyails> 7What, you think I intend to be? O_o
<drf|laptop> 03I know right
*Denied_Existence wires together the mechanized suit.
*D_man is on youtube
<ValtheJean> that's like a robot Viewtiful Joe lol
<drf|laptop> 03you've shown signs of it :P
<Quanyails> 7Lol, you know our current situation in the fora.
<D_man> super robot wars z
<NewDCD> 9it's part of a bigger robot
<D_man> looks good
<drf|laptop> 03fora? o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Flora!
<Quanyails> 7Alternate plural of forum.
<NightSeas> 12Arti Usually lets Quanyails handle such things
*Denied_Existence adds a MAG cannon to his mechanical suit.
<D_man> so yea newdcd in z2-2 there shud be a hugeass mecha with all in
<NightSeas> 12Also, you're not a mod either drf :p
<drf|laptop> 03temporarily.
*Denied_Existence installs a Type-XIV nuclear reactor in his Mechanized Suit.
<Blackwing> fact remains that he is supposed to be one :p
<D_man> Also why does the guy be shown all dodgy / shifty like with shadow over half of head? in z1 he's blueblack hair so y here not?
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<NewDCD> 9>Nuclear Reaction
<drf|laptop> 03^
<NewDCD> 9*Reactor
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<Denied_Existence> Yes, nuclear reactor.
<NewDCD> 9>not using an Hydrogen-
<NewDCD> 9*Hydrogen-3 Reactor or Fullcanelli-Type Eternal Engine in your mech
<Denied_Existence> Who said I was using FISSION?
<NightSeas> 12If you would stop being so opinionated drf
<NewDCD> 9>not using Getter Rays
<Ascendant`> And NightSeas, neither are you :p
*Denied_Existence upgrades his reactor to an antimatter engine.
<D_man> oh god here we go with the not usings :P
<D_man> lol
<NewDCD> 9OH SHIT HERE WE GO
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<D_man> WHAT NOW?
<Quanyails> 7I think we scared away Shadow. :<
<NewDCD> 9DISCALIBUR
<FlutterHi> place more pylons?
<Quanyails> 7Or it's his connection (assuming it's a he).
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<Ascendant`> There's nothing wrong with being opinionated, but also, I agree with Quan, but you didn't need to say "Eh, let me handle it." :p
<D_man> Newdcd why does the guy be shown all dodgy / shifty like with shadow over half of head? in z1 he's blueblack hair so y here not?
<NightSeas> 12It's a she I think
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds like a she
<Ascendant`> Sound like a me
<Ascendant`> sounds*
<HyperMetalLugia> Remember me?
<FlutterHi> what are you watching?
<drf|laptop> 03also what situation on the forums?
<NewDCD> 9it's because they're obscuring his (very obvious) identity due to plot reasons
*Denied_Existence wonders why FlutterHi is placing so many pylons...
<Ascendant`> What about me
<Ascendant`> it isn't fair
<D_man> o...k...?
<Ascendant`> blah blah blah
<D_man> but people who have played z1 will know easily! the mecha!
<Quanyails> 7The stuff about TST's social lethargy.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<D_man> what plot reasons?
*HyperMetalLugia sneezes
<NewDCD> 9dude it's obvious, but who cares
<Ascendant`> ok
<drf|laptop> 03you mean the bawwing thread Ascendant made?
<Denied_Existence> Damn enemies with stupid plot shields
<NewDCD> 9he's probably that "shady" to the player team
*FlutterHi is placing pylons
<Ascendant`> I make a lot of those
<Ascendant`> specify the right one :D
<D_man> I guess so
<NightSeas> 12rofl
<Ascendant`> okay
<Ascendant`> I know what you mean
<D_man> but wait...who was in z1 then?
<Ascendant`> anyway
<Shadow> I'm back.
<Ascendant`> it's true :p
<Ascendant`> and wb Shadow

<ValtheJean> FABULOOOOOOUS beam
*NightSeas eats habanero
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<NewDCD> 9SRW as a whole runs on a parallel world continuity, hinted by certain characters
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Why not. :P
<Nightshadow> It makes me think back to my "noob days"
<NightSeas> 12D:
*Denied_Existence loads a tactical cruise missile launcher onto his mechanized suit.
<Nightshadow> haha
<Shadow> finished the prologue. it's too long to put it on here, so I won't
<D_man> so every mecha's plot folds into one hugeass plot?
<Nightshadow> prologue?
<NewDCD> 9for example, Gillian Yaeger has experienced events from Original Continuity/Alpha Series and the OG series
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Forums, Shadow?
<FlutterHi> the advertisment on the top of my screen says "CLICK TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE ELECTRICITY!"
<Glacymr> 12:)
<FlutterHi> the fuck
<NewDCD> 9not really, in SRW games
<drf|laptop> 03no but, really, what thing on the forums
<NewDCD> 9most of the time
<Shadow> hi, Shadow_Lugia.
*Denied_Existence attaches 3 tri-barreled gatling guns to his mechanized suit.

<Nightshadow> lolwut
<drf|laptop> 03that's the question, I kid you not
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwhat
<NewDCD> 9for example
<D_man> Ooohhh
<NewDCD> 9if I were to make Super /co/ Wars
<Nightshadow> I was playing solitaire
<NewDCD> 9we could say that Adventure Time's land is on the other side of the EverFree Forest
<Shadow_Lugia> 6<insert meme here>
<D_man> so each 'anime' is set in another part of the same planet?
*Shadow_Lugia 6flees.
<NewDCD> 9and the Fire Nation is north of that
<NewDCD> 9and so on
<Nightshadow> ):
