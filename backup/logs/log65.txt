<Books> what's the name of the video?
<prince-dari> What is infinity? Some say it's the endless number, but in my case, infinity was my level patience. I was able to count to 1999 before I called it quits, so 2000 was my "infinity". If you're not sure what I mean, try counting to infinity for yourself and see how far you get. It's tougher than it sounds. Just don't make a video about it, please! I wasted way too much of other people's time with this video, lol
<Polarfire> ohmygod.

<Books> is what you're saying.
<Books> maybe I will.
<Polarfire> easy

<Polarfire> infinity isn't a number.
<Polarfire> ^
<Books> It can't be counted to, It doesn't work.
<Polarfire> so... here we go...
<Polarfire> 0
<Books> Nope
<Polarfire> ∞
<Polarfire> I did it.

<Polarfire> I counted to infinity.
<Books> IT CAN'T BE DONE, i TELL YOU
<Polarfire> I'll do it again for the record.
<Polarfire> 0
<Polarfire> ∞
<Polarfire> :P
<Polarfire> baaaah
<Books> If you put a number on infinity then you just cant imagine endlessness.
<Polarfire> hey dari
<Books> Which is not a sign of intelligence.
<Polarfire> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li7p39TkII1qafrh6.jpg

<Polarfire> You'll only be classy when you have a shoe on your head.
<Books> They all sound the same to me, I'm not going to lie.

<Jenemmy> She's all "negro" this and "black" that.
<Jenemmy> It drills into your head.
<Books> Saying "black" isn't racist.
<prince-dari> Which just about all young people seem to be here. >_>

<Umbreon> 12wb LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<Umbreon> 12how was the boss fight?
<Polarfire> did he not plant his feet high enough on the wall?
<prince-dari> Here's the film scene.
<prince-dari> With David Belle.
<Polarfire> ok.
<prince-dari> It's probably just that he didn't commit as he did in the gym.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Tough x-X
<Polarfire> ah.
<Umbreon> 12took you awhile
<prince-dari> It's much easier to fully commit when you know you'll be fine if you fail.
<Polarfire> true true
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Distractions yo
<prince-dari> YFW David Belle really can do all this.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> and lack of levelling properly
<Umbreon> 12sorry i didn't distract you more
<Umbreon> 12:<
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Oh and weak ass weapons
<Umbreon> 12need to keep it challenging
<Polarfire> mfw
<Polarfire> :O
<Jenemmy> Le Gasp!
<prince-dari> You should see the final jump.
<prince-dari> It's insane.
<prince-dari> This is parkour.
<prince-dari> THe previous video was freerunning.
<Polarfire> what's the difference?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Being level 18 at a recommended level 36 point = suicide
<prince-dari> There's not set 'moves' as such.
<prince-dari> You just get from A to B using your environment.
<prince-dari> It's not a sport.
<prince-dari> You don't have parkour competitions.
<Umbreon> 12not for you
<Polarfire> ah.
<Umbreon> 12you are too epic
<prince-dari> It's a method of movement I suppose is how you'd describe it.
<Jenemmy> ,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,;l,;l,;l;,l;,l;,l;,l;,l;
<Polarfire> yeah...there's no way I could do this stuff :S
<Jenemmy> Me either
<prince-dari> Practice.

<Jenemmy> I would (a) give up. (b) die of exhaustion
<prince-dari> My head
<prince-dari> Blown.
<Polarfire> wow.
<Jenemmy> Mind = Blown
<Polarfire> can you show the jump again?
<prince-dari> Oh, sure.
<Polarfire> wow.
<prince-dari> Ah, David Belle describing parkour himself.
<prince-dari> That's the best way to learn. :P
<Dragoran> oh wow
<Dragoran> Altair is still on
<Jenemmy> Have any of you ever read/watched BEN?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Ascendant> o_o
<Jenemmy> Is it creepy?
<prince-dari> Not really.
<Jenemmy> Let me rephrase: is it creepy for someone who shivers at Saw but laughs at Cupcakes?
<prince-dari> I dunno, it's not really like either.
<Books> You laughed at cupcakaes...?
<prince-dari> I did too.
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<prince-dari> The puns, so funny.
<Jenemmy> It amused me
<Polarfire> best puns ever
<Books> Well, now I just feel lame.
<Polarfire> but that was about it.
<prince-dari> Nah, don't feel like that Books.
<Jenemmy> "Why do they call it a hacksaw?"
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<prince-dari> Lots of people really don't like it.
<Polarfire> naah books
<Jenemmy> I've been watching horrors since I was four
<Jenemmy> It's my thing.
<Polarfire> Its the most infamous fic ever.
<Books> I liked it, but it was still unnerving
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lol
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> I grew up on pychological horrors.
<Books> >_>
<Jenemmy> Sometimes, the tiny cell in the back of my mind that a crazy cannibal is at the other end of the dark hallway.
<prince-dari> Parkour, best done shirtless, without shoes.
<Polarfire> If you didn't like it... just say so. Nobody can take your opinion :P
<prince-dari> XD
<Books> lol
<Jenemmy> I mean it D:
<prince-dari> Not wearing shoes actually does help though.
<Books> huh? No I liked cupcakes.
<Jenemmy> How so?
<Jenemmy> No restrictions?
<Books> I like getting creeped out by things
<prince-dari> Yeah, it allows for movement so much better.
<Books> that's why I love nosleep.
<Jenemmy> I do in a way.
<Books> anyway
<prince-dari> You're not made to run with shoes on.
<prince-dari> It's so much easier to land, jump, push off walls, etc without shoes.
<Jenemmy> Here's how I go: decide to read creepypasta with zero suggestion, insta-regret.
<Jenemmy> Pro writers these days
<Jenemmy> I'm not even man enough to read Slenderman
<prince-dari> I think I'll go after this.
<Polarfire> :(
<prince-dari> Then come back later.
<Jenemmy> All I know is photo, faceless guy appears, random death
<Polarfire> how later?
<prince-dari> I dunno.
<Jenemmy> What time is it for you?
<prince-dari> 9:37 am
<Polarfire> I'm pobably gonna go sleep some soon.
<Books> wait
<Polarfire> I need it.
<Books> read slenderman?
<Jenemmy> No.
<Jenemmy> I don't think I would make it.
<prince-dari> SHIT

<Books> it's known mostly from marble hornets
<Jenemmy> Oh.

<Jenemmy> Still
<Jenemmy> I dare not learn the tale
<Books> It's creepy as fuck
<Polarfire> those guys are amazingly strong
<Jenemmy> Good thing I haven't read it.
<prince-dari> Someone told me it wasn't creepy until they got lost in the forrest at night.
<Jenemmy> I mean
<Books> Slenderman is always there, in the distance
<Jenemmy> Watched it
<Books> whenever you
<prince-dari> Then suddenly it become very creepy.
<Books> are thinking of slenderman
<Books> always.
<Books> If you ever record yourself thinking of slenderman

<Jenemmy> But still I'd disassemble them, drive to my aunt's two away, and hide them in their dog house.
<Jenemmy> In which they never look at
<Books> there's a shed half a mile into a forest by the church i used to go to, it's perfect if i didn't want to bury them.
<Jenemmy> Plan - Mariah's death.
<Books> other then the fact that it's probably haunted, it works.
<Jenemmy> Reason: Mariah is sitting there chatting up a storm with this girl
<Books> I know someone name mariah...
<Jenemmy> That I may or may not consider beautiful
<Jenemmy> Reason 2: She is super rude and obnoxious
<Books> My reasons are asually not very well thought out.
<Jenemmy> Plan: Wear gloves to school oneday during the winter
<Books> changes from time to time
<Books> hm, winter is a bad time for murder.
<Jenemmy> Be careful not to touch the palm area whilst putting them on
<Books> snow leaves tracks, buried bodies don't start decomposing untill later
<Jenemmy> Trip girl down the huge stairwell with either boot or hands.
<Books> cold makes all outdoor work harder
<Jenemmy> Be sure girl is around her clique.
<Books> make it look like an accident?
<Jenemmy> Main suspects: Frenemies and other drama queens.
<Books> not much fun, but it works
<Jenemmy> Exactly.
<Jenemmy> They're always huddled so close together.
<Jenemmy> One could easily trip the other.
<Books> also, you can't be around other murders
<Jenemmy> Wait a second.
<Books> if you become even a suspect in another murder
<Books> after "accidently
<Books> "
<Books> killing someone else
<Jenemmy> Why am I talking about murdering someone with a complete stranger over the internet at six in the morning?
<Books> then you're guilty
<Jenemmy> Because it's fun :P
<Books> better then telling someone you know.
<Jenemmy> Indeed
<Books> then they'd get worried.
<Jenemmy> Rule #1: Never trust anybody
<Books> I love the idea of murder
<Books> it's interesting
<Jenemmy> They'll sell you down the river.
<Books> also suicide an cannibalism, and torture.
<NightSeas> 12Yay
<Books> but anyway, murder.
<Jenemmy> A good "accident" theme is to use a sniper, shoot a heavy branch so it will tumble down on your victim.
<Books> hm, they check the branch in accidents
<Jenemmy> Be sure to pick up the remnants of the shooting
<Books> they still might be able to check
<Jenemmy> True
<Books> needs to be a really weak branch,
<Jenemmy> If you tried hard enough, it might work.
<Books> a perfect shot,
<Ascendant> bbl, remind me to set it up
<Ascendant> actually
<Books> too much work and luck
<Books> if the wind was goign the wrong way, it might not work
<Ascendant> !stafftodo add Ascendant - Set up the TST PO server
<ScriptBot> 04ToDo added: 03Ascendant - Set up the TST PO ... as number 042.
<Books> better to be on the tree and break it manually
<Jenemmy> What was an elaborate plan you thought of?
<Books> not that eaborate. just the basics.
<Books> chop off limbs, using toold in my house
<Jenemmy> Hm.
<Books> put into a few trash bags
<Jenemmy> To put where?
<Books> carry/drive to the forest by the my old church
<Books> (nearby)
<Books> and bury seven feet uner a few miles into the woods
<Books> might take all night
<Jenemmy> Seven foot whole takes a lot of work.
<Books> but seven feet means nothing gets there but bugs
<Jenemmy> *hole
<Books> ha
<Books> haha
<Jenemmy> Another plan.
<Jenemmy> Keep disassembled body parts in large hamster food bag
<Books> that would take awhile...
<Jenemmy> Hmm...
<Books> have any dogs?
<Jenemmy> Off the top of my head
<Jenemmy> No, I do not.
<Books> hamsters don't eat much
<Jenemmy> Dogs do.
<Books> having any DNA evidence around is risky shit
<Jenemmy> Exactly.
<Jenemmy> That's why cannibalism is ideal.
<Jenemmy> But, humans might not be tasty
<Books> indeed, then what about the bones and other inedibals?
<Jenemmy> So feed something else
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> if you cook them right, you can stand it
<Books> unless the fact that it is human bothers you
<Jenemmy> Orrr give the dog the bone to chew on
<Jenemmy> I got an idea
<Jenemmy> Break and enter into someone's house
<Books> skulls aren't exactly socially acceptble in that sense
<Books> yes?
<Jenemmy> There's a lady down the driveway
<Jenemmy> her gate is usually locked
<Jenemmy> I can climb it, though
<Jenemmy> One day, while she's out
<Jenemmy> If there isn't any DNA evidence on the body
<Jenemmy> I could hide it somewhere in her home
<Jenemmy> Somewhere she'd never, ever look.
<Books> bones themselves can still be identified.
<Jenemmy> That's true
<Books> and if you're goign to hide them in somes elses house, make sure it's far
<Jenemmy> But if they aren't found in the first place...?
<Books> if it ever gets found, they ask all the neghbors
<Jenemmy> Yeah, you are right
<Jenemmy> I KNOW
<Books> if you can hide them that well, great.
<Books> but it would be easier to jsut bury it then
<Jenemmy> I have a gigantic chocolate bunny from easter.
<Jenemmy> He's hollow.
<Books> D:
<Jenemmy> Take a bit off his ears, put a few hands in, put ears back on.
<Jenemmy> Re-tape package.
<Jenemmy> What do you think?
<Books> and then what, keep it around?
<Jenemmy> Then dispose of it.
<Jenemmy> Put it in the trash.
<Books> Better to throw it away. It's more effiant then you would tihnk to just trash dead people
<Books> yeah
<Jenemmy> That'll get rid of some of the parts.
<Books> they don't keep records of whose trashe is whose, and the don't search it
<Books> in small piesces, it's easy
<Jenemmy> Or wrap the body up in a rug and throw it off a bridge :P
<Books> (sorry about my spelling, btw. I can't see my keyboard)
<Jenemmy> It's okay.
<Books> dead bodies float.
<Jenemmy> Cinderblocks are the only answer!
<Books> needs weights
<Books> and need to be deep as hell.
<Books> but it could work.
<Jenemmy> Could drive cross-state to Lake Erie
<Books> @murderousmeter jenemmy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 jenemmy is 45% murderous. (284)
<Books> not bad
<Jenemmy> I live in Philadelphia
<Jenemmy> @murderousmeter Books
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Books is 24% murderous. (285)
<Books> D:
<Jenemmy> That's wrong, anyways.

<Jenemmy> Still, I found someone with my own interest ;u;
<Books> Hell yeah
<Books> Murder is interesting.
<Books> and so are ponies.
<Jenemmy> Murder IS interesting.
<Books> who would ahve though two people thought both were interesting?
<Books> and then met in a chatroom
<Books> about ponies
<Jenemmy> BAM!
<Books> and starting talking about murder
<Jenemmy> Instafriendship.
<Books> hell yeah.
<Jenemmy> Friendship really is magic.
<Books> Indeed!
<Jenemmy> Say, do you have a YouTube account?
<Jenemmy> Or some other form of contact/
<Books> I just made in a few hours ago.
<Jenemmy> I'd love to talk some more ^^
<Books> I have a google+, I'm on that more
<eXAKR> YES
<Books> and my google+ is for brony stuff soley
<eXAKR> I got a job!
<Jenemmy> I hate meeting interesting people and only getting to talk for one day.
<Books> (because my family doesn't know I love ponies)
<Books> Indeed.
<Jenemmy> Say. maybe if we both like murder, we might have other things in common too!
<Ascendant> congratulations
<Ascendant> and bbl
<eXAKR> I just got an e-mail from the company I interviewed with asking if they want the job they offered.
<Dusky> 06nice one eXAKR!
<Books> Of course! I'd hope so
<Books> here, before the internet cuts out.
<Jenemmy> Hmmm...
<Books> http://www.youtube.com/user/Obscurepopculture?feature=mhee
<Jenemmy> My invitation has been sent.
<Books> and jsut so I asked, did you want a google+?
<Jenemmy> Would you consider yourself somewhat of an artist?
<Jenemmy> Oh no, thank you
<Jenemmy> I don't necessarily have one
<Books> Not in the since of drawing or painting or anything, no.
<Books> sadly.
<Books> so you don't want an invite? alright.
<Jenemmy> mmmmmmmkay.
<Books> I mostly do writing, as far as art goes
<Jenemmy> Weird.
<Jenemmy> I love writing
<Jenemmy> In fact, remember that game I told you about earlier?
<Jenemmy> "Transformice"
<Books> yes?
<Books> I played it for aminute and failed. I tihnk
<Jenemmy> I'm up to Chapter Five on my fanfiction of it
<eXAKR> Thanks!
<Jenemmy> Working on chapter six
<Books> lol nice
<Books> I never did a fanfiction for anything, I'd like to sometime.
<Jenemmy> lol nice indeed mate
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> It's fun to see where your mind can wonder
<Jenemmy> Every nook and cranny, there's a new adventure.
<Books> So, before I become too comfortable talking with you, where do you live?
<Jenemmy> And better yet, you don't even need to come up with personalities!
<Books> (to make sure we don't know eachother irl)
<Jenemmy> Philadelphia.
<Jenemmy> NE Philadelphia
<Books> alright, cool. I don't know anyone there.
<Books> I'm in michigan
<Jenemmy> My real name is Emily
<Jenemmy> Ah.
<Books> lol I saw that from your youtube
<Jenemmy> Is it nice there
<Books> I'm Ben.
<Books> (I don't really like that name though)
<Books> :/
<Jenemmy> D'aw
<Books> It's... alright. Either too hot or too cold all the time
<Jenemmy> I always had a place for Ben deep in my heart ^^
<Books> but I never lived anywhere else, so I don't know much about other weathers
<Jenemmy> Oh, I see.
<Jenemmy> Me either.
<Books> lol that's not a weird thing to say..?
<Jenemmy> All I know is South = hot.
<Books> and north is cold.
<Jenemmy> I've only been to Florida, and it is sweltering.
<Books> just look at canada
<Jenemmy> Here in Philly, we're having a heatwave.
<Books> it's usually cold up here, if it were either way
<Books> So is the rest of the country
<Books> bleh, I hate summer.
<Jenemmy> Winter = 0-10 in extremes, 20 - 50 normally.
<Jenemmy> Spring = 50 - 70 average.
<Jenemmy> Summer = 90-110 in extremes, 70 - 90 avg.
<Jenemmy> Fall is about the same as Spring.
<Jenemmy> Now you know the weather in Pennsylvania :D
<Books> sounds about right.
<Books> not that different
<Books> i tihnk
<Books> so what's your favorite season?
<Jenemmy> I like Spring alot
<Jenemmy> The jittery feeling of just getting out of school
<Books> I prefer fall
<Jenemmy> The billions of contests and raffles just before a three-month dismissal
<Books> I actually never went to school.
<Jenemmy> The weather that's just chilly enough.
<Books> I've been homeschooled my entire life
<Jenemmy> Is it nice?
<Books> I think so, yeah
<Jenemmy> I've always wanted to be homeschooled.
<Books> It depends a lot on the parents
<Books> i know some homeschooled kids who are total idoits
<Books> or socially inept
<Jenemmy> The only downside is that you don't meet other people and that I would think you don't have any end of year contests.
<Books> or just jerks
<Jenemmy> Because we all know who would win.
<Jenemmy> Hm.
<Jenemmy> I have heard that homeschoolers are uncivilized.
<Books> Actually there are a lot of homeschool programs throughout the hear
<Books> A lot fo them are, don't get me wrong
<Books> it's not "Better" or "worse"
<Books> it's very variable.
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> Like real school
<Jenemmy> *public school.
<Books> I tihnk, for me, homeschooling was perfect
<Jenemmy> 3/4 are idiots, the others can actually spell.
<Books> more then a little bias, though
<Books> eh, a but harshe
<Jenemmy> I can be a bit of a grammar nazi at times.
<Books> You mispelled a lot
<Books> you said alot
<Books> just thought you should know,
<Books> if you're a grammar nazi
<Books> :)
<Jenemmy> :)
<Jenemmy> Thank you for correcting me
<Books> Anyway, I agree, the english language is one of the things I care all too much about
<Jenemmy> *me.
<Books> I got obsessed when I was younger, I would look up any word I didn't know the definition too
<Books> .
<Books> lol
<Jenemmy> :)
<Jenemmy> Same
<Books> I challenge you to a game a scrabble, at some point.
<Jenemmy> I am constantly using a thesarus, god knows why.
<Books> Fun stuff.
<Jenemmy> Fun stuff indeed.
<Jenemmy> Could you say you have a favorite meme?
<Jenemmy> I really can't
<Books> Waffles?
<Jenemmy> They all make me gigle
<Jenemmy> *giggle
<Books> Don't you mean Carrots??
<Jenemmy> If MLP:FiM is considered a meme, then it is my favorite.
<Books> No no no...
<Books> MLP is a LIFESTYLE
<Jenemmy> Oh yeah
<Books> since I found it, I've been so much happier.
<Jenemmy> Silly me.
<Jenemmy> I know.
<Books> I am smiling tenfold more
<Jenemmy> And tending to eat more apples.
<Books> I laugh for no reason in public
<Jenemmy> me too,
<Jenemmy> *Me too.
<Books> I am honestly worried my parents will think I am doing drugs
<Jenemmy> I make so many typos >.>
<Books> I am just so much happier since I started watching MLP
<Books> (I won't correct you, I;m making tons as well)
<Books> See?
<Jenemmy> What was the first instance of pony you've ever seen?
<Jenemmy> Mine was on the television, the end of Fall Weather Friends.
<Books> My best friends quoted in around me
<Books> I had no idea what it was
<Jenemmy> Good thing they brought you in
<Jenemmy> The herd is a magical place.
<Books> I asked, he told me, I was baffled, I wactched, and happiness unsued.
<Books> Actually, he isn't much of a Brony
<Books> I mean, he's my age and likes the show
<Jenemmy> I converted two friends so far.
<Jenemmy> Have tuba, will travel!
<Books> but he watched it from his younger sister, and doesn't do anything online about it
<Sally> :o
<Jenemmy> My cousin, the one in which I made the background for, love love LOVES Gummy.
<Books> I don't know if it counts if he doesn't do anytihng Pony-esc online
*Sally waves at Cat and where
<Books> fuck yeah gummy
<Books> trying to murder ponies since season 1
<Cat> Hi Sally! :o
<Jenemmy> lawl
<Cat> sup?
<Jenemmy> In the tub with Twilight
<Jenemmy> AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH
<Sally> Hi ^-^, nuffin
<Books> :D
<Cat> like a muffin
<Books> How long have you been a brony?
<Cat> I don't know why I said that
<Jenemmy> ...
<Cat> mew
<Books> (brony being used in a gender-neutural way)
<Jenemmy> I constantly find myself saying that.
<Sally> cuz muffins are good?
<Jenemmy> I honestly cannot remember.
<Cat> maybe!
<Cat> muffins are pretty good
<Jenemmy> May, I believe?
<Books> nice.
<Cat> I just had poached egg and fried potatoes
<Jenemmy> The only episode I've seen live is the finale.
<Sally> what is a poached egg?
<Jenemmy> That is soon to change.
<Sally> i like fried potaterz
<Sally> <..< is poached sunny side up?
<Books> Honestly, I just got into last month, I only watched all the eps 2-3 times
<Cat> where you break the egg into boiling water
<Books> I never watcched any live or near-live
<Cat> it's a bit like a much healthier fried egg
<Jenemmy> Mmm
<Jenemmy> Even repeats?
<Sally> :O
<Books> I'm the youngest in my house, I'm 16 years old.
<Sally> interesting
<Books> I don't get to watch MLP on the tv
<Sally> i think i'll try that
<Jenemmy> Usually on at 8:30, 1:30, and 6:30
<Jenemmy> 8 and 1 are the same episodes.
<Cat> look it up or something
<Cat> they're quite nice
<Books> none of those times work, but that's fine. I have it all on my computer.
<Books> :D
<Jenemmy> Have you ever been insulted by anyone the second the theme song hits your ear?
<Jenemmy> OH! Do you know a way to download s1?
<Books> What do you mean? (first question)
<Dusky> 06xD
<Jenemmy> TV: My little pony~
<Dusky> 06thats not something you see everyday
<Books> Not legally, but I have my ways. (it's all free on youtrube, so maybe it is legal)
<Jenemmy> Mocking male friend: Ha! MLP?
<Sally> i did :P, i'll try it for breakfast... when everyone is awake.
<Books> Like I said, I never watched it on the tv
<Books> only on my laptop
<Books> after everyone else is asleep
<Jenemmy> Well, has anyone ever heard the theme?
<Books> and no one is around to hear it
<Jenemmy> Oh.
<Books> Nope, headphones
<Books> I'm careful.
<eXAKR> What
<Jenemmy> Do you think you'll ever come out of Equestria and admit it?
<Books> If asked, yes.
<Cat> hooray
<Cat> I don't even know what time it is where you are :P
<Jenemmy> My parents know, they're slightly weirded out, but don't care.
<Cat> I'm gonna guess at like 6am
<Books> and to my friends that have seen some of the show through younger sisters, yes
<Books> probably.
<Dusky> 06Ascendant getting a time-out
<Sally> close :P
<Sally> 5:22am
<Jenemmy> Hm
<Books> I even hinted to one of my friends, he didn't drill into it too much
<eXAKR> Heh
<Books> I'm not hiding the fact that I like the show.
<Jenemmy> If someone asks what shows you like, will you gladly list it?
<Sally> parents wont be up for another hour or so
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> My friends love ponies
<Books> No, not if it left vague
<Books> lcuky you, I wish my friends knew
<Jenemmy> I'm hoping to convert some younger sisters of girls I know.
<Jenemmy> All you have to do is ask
<Books> "when does the narwal sparkle?"
<Jenemmy> Before: You watch my little pony? -shows a bit of ticket master- This looks pretty gay. After: Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony.
<Books> sorry, ask what again?
<Jenemmy> Ask your friends
<Jenemmy> To watcch
<Jenemmy> *watch
<Jenemmy> an episode.
<Books> No no, start with another episode
<Jenemmy> And all of your dreams will come true.
<Jenemmy> Exactly.
<Books> ticket master can come off as too girly
<Jenemmy> Ticket Master gave a rough start
<Books> maybe start with bridle gossip
<Jenemmy> It was the best one on demand at the time;
<Books> swarm of the century
<Jenemmy> Sonic Rainboom could do the trick
<Cat> your parents get up before 7?
<Cat> I woke up at 9am today
<Jenemmy> I would advise Dragonshy, but the way she defeats the dragon can come off as to feminine.
<Books> indeed, shows some good humour at the begining, and looks badass later
<Books> and dragonshy isn't something i would recomend
<Books> at first, but it's up there.
<Jenemmy> Party of One was great, it converted said friend, but it works best after knowing Pinkie's character.
<Books> after they see one/two
<Sally> yeah, for work :p
<Books> swarm of the century shows her at her best
<Books> after that party of one
<Jenemmy> I know, right!
<Sally> mom has to be at work by 8 idk about dad
<Books> I need to write this down...
<Jenemmy> Pilots - Definitely necessary.
<Jenemmy> However, they may come off as a tad weird at first
<Cat> both my parents are not at work today
<Books> But way to girly and seem weird
<Jenemmy> Some shows, it's best you watch the pilot afterwards.
<Books> a bad place to start to the skeptic brony
<Jenemmy> Ticket Master- No way, no how.
<Jenemmy> 1. Shows Applejack as a stereotypical hillbilly.
<Books> I'd say wait to watch ticket master until just before best night ever
<Jenemmy> 2. Scraping the bottom of the barrel
<Books> Wait, art of the dress in between
<Sally> :o wai?
<Jenemmy> (Two tickets, who to pick?)
<Jenemmy> That's so OLD.
<Books> indeed
<Books> not original
<Jenemmy> 4. Applebuck season
<Jenemmy> Revolves around TREES.
<Jenemmy> >.>
<Books> crack jokes about drunk AJ during ep
<Cat> dunno
<Books> so it seems more casual
<Jenemmy> I don't even like this episode too much, and I'm a brony
<Jenemmy> However
<Cat> dad has been working on the roof, mum has been helping somewhat
<Books> which one?
<Jenemmy> Alcohol jokes will coax them though.
<Cat> also I think they're taking my grandparents to the airport to go back to spain later
<Books> I dunno.
<Jenemmy> This is a maybe
<Sally> ooooo, spain
<Jenemmy> Griffon the Brush-Off
<Books> I never watched the show with someone else irl
<Books> avoid that one
<Jenemmy> This episode introduces other species
<Books> annoying characters area a bad thing to enter with
<Books> maybe avodide trixie,
<Books> and also CMC
<Jenemmy> Which may seem less like MLP and more like MLG (My Little Griffon)
<Books> for early episodes
<Books> I'd watch that show/
<Jenemmy> They need to ease into the horse envirronents
<Books> windter wrap-up
<Jenemmy> Trixie may come off as a recurring character in Boast Busters.
<Cat> yeah, that's where they live
<Jenemmy> We don't want that.
<Books> a good episode, if the veiwer can stand the singing
<Jenemmy> Besides, little Pinkie + Fluttershy
<Jenemmy> What was seven, again?
<Books> dragonshy?
<Jenemmy> Oh yes!
<Jenemmy> Like said earlier, dragon defeating method may come off as girly.
<Sally> shweetness
<Books> but otherwise, it itruduces all the charctrs
<Jenemmy> But fainting goats and A-Team references are pure gold.
<Books> and what they do
<Books> etc
<Jenemmy> Precisely
<Jenemmy> A good reccomendation.
<Books> ohmy god my spelling is god-awful
<Books> anywa
<Jenemmy> Look Before You Sleep
<Jenemmy> No Way
<Books> way too girly
<Books> too enforced morals
<Jenemmy> Hillbilly + Girly girl = Bad combo
<Jenemmy> Exactly
<Sally> ;-; getting a headache from not sleeping @_@
<Books> makes all the characters look stupid
*Sally must stay awake!
<Jenemmy> Mmhmm
<Jenemmy> Besides, no Fluttershy, Pinkie, or RD!
<Jenemmy> Baaddd episode for first-timers.
<Books> feeling pinkie keen?
<Jenemmy> Bridle Gossip
<Jenemmy> Bridle Gossip was nice.
<Jenemmy> I really liked it.
<Books> indeed, the morals seem a bit forced,
<Books> but it is a little girl's shpw
<Jenemmy> It gives a short pause to introduce the characters to the viewer.
<Cat> how long have you been awake?
<Jenemmy> Then a few hilarious changed.
<Jenemmy> *changes.
<Jenemmy> Evil Enchantress may be a bit overwhelming though.
<Sally> uuuuuuuhhhh... well
<Books> Flutterguy is funny to everyone, though
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Sally> i woke up at 9am yesterday morning.. sooo
<Jenemmy> Fluttershy + Morgan Freeman
<Books> if they see at least one ep with allt he characters before that one
<Jenemmy> Lol!
<Sally> 20hours or something
<Books> so they get why the jokes are funny
<Jenemmy> Next, Swarm of the Century
<Books> from poinson joke
<Jenemmy> What do you think?
<Books> Pinkie at her fines
<Books> t
<Jenemmy> I don't watch Swarm of the Century too often.
<Books> It's one of the best, I tihnk.
<Books> I loved it.
<Jenemmy> Okay1
<Books> no singing, ntohing too girly
<Jenemmy> *Okay!
<Jenemmy> Instarec!
<Jenemmy> Winter Wrap Up.
<Jenemmy> The singing is great for a brony.
<Jenemmy> Outsiders?
<Jenemmy> Not so much.
<Books> if they get passed the song, then it's good
<Books> but yeah
<Jenemmy> It ruins they episode for a newcomer.
<Books> morals are a little forved, but good jokes and a good ep
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> some people like songs
<Books> I dunno
<Jenemmy> Still singing the first episode is very bad.
<Jenemmy> They think they sing in every ep.
<Books> meh
<Books> yeah
<Jenemmy> Meh.
<Jenemmy> Meh tier.
<Jenemmy> Call of the Cutie
<Books> no no no
<Jenemmy> Completely revolves around tramp stamps.
<Books> they could get too mad at the annoying characters
<Jenemmy> Hell no.
<Jenemmy> Plus fillies!
<Books> doesn't work with the mane cast
<Books> psudo school drama

<Jenemmy> Fall Weather Friends
<Books> yeah
<Jenemmy> My first episode.
<Jenemmy> I think it worked well with me.
<Jenemmy> Pinkie's commentary was hilarious.
<Books> Good. may seem a little homoerotic but it works
<Books> no singing, i don't think
<Books> celestia
<Jenemmy> Moral isn't too forced.
<Jenemmy> Overall a good episode to a newcomer.
<Books> Indeed.
<Jenemmy> However, one thing.
<Books> Maybe not the most interesting to the newcomer,
<Books> hmm?
<Jenemmy> A bit too much is put on the fact that Rainbow is a pegasus.
<Books> well,
<Books> i mean,
<Books> she is
<Jenemmy> The term "wings" is used twenty times.
<Books> it's an important part of the ep
<Jenemmy> Plus random Princess at the end.
<Books> okay, maybe not ideal, but can still be used early on
<Jenemmy> Yes.
<Jenemmy> Yes it can.
<Books> fuck yeah celestia.
<Jenemmy> Suited for Success.
<Books> nope.aj
<Jenemmy> Revolves around dresses.
<Jenemmy> y/n/
<Jenemmy> >NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Jenemmy> RARITY: D:
<Jenemmy> The End
<Books> watch ticket master > suited for success > best night ever
<Books> keep in context,
<Books> in order,
<Jenemmy> Feeling Pinkie Keen
<Books> and get all out of the way
<Books> A great episode,
<Jenemmy> What do you think of it?
<Jenemmy> I love it
<Books> proves it's not just about prancing ponies
<Books> as many think it does
<Jenemmy> Especially panicky Spike and damaged Twi.
<Jenemmy> Sonic Rainboom
<Jenemmy> Hmmm
<Books> the moral can come off badly to some people, but the jokes are good
<Books> hmm
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> Scared RD is a boost
<Books> rarity is bad in that one
<Books> comes off as a total bitch
<Jenemmy> Still, all about believing in yourself
<Jenemmy> yadda yadda yadda
<Books> and RD being badass
<Books> can point out Doctor Whooves
<Jenemmy> Wonderbolts pretty damn cool though.
<Books> and derpy
<Jenemmy> Yay seen was spectacukar
<Jenemmy> *spectacular
<Books> yell yes
<Books> funny jokes to start with
<Books> badass later
<Books> and rainbow drinking pinkie
<Books> fuck yea rainbows
<Jenemmy> If you make a point of pointing out Derpy and the doctor, they'll see the subtle refs.
<Jenemmy> It gives you a bit of happiness.
<Books> Make them look for derpy, and notice the doctor
<Books> OH!
<Jenemmy> Stare master.
<Books> FwF
<Jenemmy> Yeah?
<Books> point of 42
<Books> on the vest
<Jenemmy> Oh yeah!
<Books> they see a refence they get, and feel better about the show
<Jenemmy> And the five Bon-Bons in the background
<Jenemmy> Okay. now Stare Master
<Jenemmy> NO.
<Jenemmy> Show Stoppers.
<Books> More CMC
<Jenemmy> ...
<Books> No
<Jenemmy> Yeah, no.
<Books> hm.
<Jenemmy> OH, THE SONG!
<Jenemmy> DEFINITE NO.
<Books> hell no
<Books> I'd be okay not seeing it at all
<Jenemmy> A Dog and Pony Show.
<Books> yes
<Books> Good jokes
<Books> rarity at her best
<Jenemmy> Rarity seems so girly, but she's hilarious
<Books> actual action
<Jenemmy> Plus Spike rocks
<Jenemmy> He is kickass in this ep
<Books> "BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHIIIINNIIINGG"
<Books> gold
<Jenemmy> Agreed.
<Jenemmy> A yesisode
<Books> that's the first MLP thing I ever heard
<Books> lol
<Jenemmy> "Green isn't your color"
<Books> ZE MGICKD
<Books> s
<Books> FLOOTERSHY
<Books> sorry, i love that character
<Jenemmy> Ikr
<Books> I'd recomend it
<Jenemmy> Anna Wintour pony is best pony
<Books> but it is a little odd
<Books> wait
<Books> wait
<Books> FOREVER
<Jenemmy> A bit girly with the modeling, though,
<Books> great pinkie pie stuff
<Books> pinkie pie gold
<Jenemmy> Great Pinkie indeed.
<Books> I'd recomend it to the less-manly veiwer
<Jenemmy> "I'm so frustrated I could just scream! Aaah."
<Books> feel better?
<Jenemmy> -sigh- no.
<Jenemmy> Great episode.
<Books> -brohoof-
<Jenemmy> YES
<Jenemmy> -brohoof-
<Jenemmy> Over a Barrel
<Books> i liked it
<Jenemmy> I did too.
<Books> i'd like to be a tree
<Jenemmy> One problem: Song
<Books> Pinkies?
<Jenemmy> One solution: Nobody likes the song.
<Jenemmy> Yes, Pinkie's.
<Books> the show says the song was bad
<Books> I wouldn't worry about it
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> it's a part of the joke
<Jenemmy> That's just it.
<Books> It's a good one
<Jenemmy> So the song doesn't matter.
<Jenemmy> Plus pie that solves war.
<Jenemmy> Hilarious.
<Books> apple pie wars are good
<Books> yeah
<Books> :D
<Jenemmy> Recommend.
<Jenemmy> Bird in Hoof?
<Jenemmy> yes/no
<Jenemmy> I'm unsure
<Books> er, which on is that oen agian?
<Jenemmy> Philomena?
<Jenemmy> Fluttershy?
<Books> ohh
<Books> sorry i got it now
<Jenemmy> Tea Trolling?
<Books> not really, it's a good epidode,
<Books> but not a good one to see early
<Jenemmy> Yeah.
<Jenemmy> Agreed.
<Books> metiocre
<Jenemmy> It just wouldn't come off too well.
<Books> more CMC after that
<Jenemmy> CMCC?
<Jenemmy> Hmm
<Books> huh?
<Books> oh
<Jenemmy> Revolves around butt symbols.
<Books> i am tired
<Books> and kids
<Books> er, fillies
<Books> bad to start with
<Books> mostly annoying episodes
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> no
<Jenemmy> later
<Books> the ones with CMC
<Jenemmy> Owl's well that end's well.
<Books> i like it
<Jenemmy> One of my favorites.
<Jenemmy> I do too.
<Books> shows some not-so-good spike
<Books> but i like it
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> and who can't love that owl
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> And the fact that he's her slave
<Jenemmy> Spike
<Books> who?
<Jenemmy> Spike's nervous laugh = Instad'aaawww
<Books> lol indeed
<Books> early, but needs some info on characters to really enhoy
<Books> enjoy
<Books> early ep.
<Jenemmy> Number one assistant = Pick up my books off the floor and put them back, bitch.
<Books> ha, it just highlighted "books"
<Jenemmy> Party of One
<Jenemmy> Loved.
<Books> I've been waiting all night for that to happen.
<Jenemmy> It.
<Books> :3
<Jenemmy> <333333
<Jenemmy> Yes
<Books> Indeed!!
<Jenemmy> Yes
<Jenemmy> YES.
<Jenemmy> The Best Night Ever.
<Books> needs some info on pinkie, but can be shown after one good ep with here
<Jenemmy> Not to a first timer
<Jenemmy> Just because
<Books> the best night ever is the last ep
<Jenemmy> They have little idea on their speculations
<Books> needs to be the last one they see
<Books> it's a good episode,
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Books> kinda girly
<Jenemmy> THE END.
<Books> but it doesn't mastter, it's the endig
<Jenemmy> Overall, we said
<Jenemmy> Dragonshy
<Jenemmy> Bridle Gossip
<Books> swarm of the century
<Jenemmy> MAAYBBEEE FWF
<Jenemmy> Feeling Pinkie Keen
<Books> party of one
<Jenemmy> Dog + Pony Show
<Jenemmy> Green isn
<Books> owl's well
<Jenemmy> Over a Barrel
<Jenemmy> And party of one
<Jenemmy> Write this down!
<Books> You write it down, I don't ahve any pens
<Books> lol
<Books> If my 14 year old self saw myself now, i'd wonder if I had gone insane.
<Books> I just spent 4 hours in this chatroom talking (mostly) about ponies
<Books> listening to MLP music
<Jenemmy> written
<Books> and browsning /r/mylittlepony
<Books> all of them?
<Jenemmy> Yeah
<Jenemmy> Ones we said would work out
<Books> I think Party of one should be sooner,
<Jenemmy> FUUUUU NIGHTLY ROUNDUP STILL ISN'T UP
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> EqD
<Books> what's nightly round up?
<Jenemmy> Just a bunch of pony stuff that happened that day
<Books> ahh
<Books> cool
<Jenemmy> ...
<Jenemmy> Now what?
<Books> ??
<Books> I dunno
<Jenemmy> LOL I DUNNO
<Books> lol
<Jenemmy> :PPP
<Books> now that we spent so long talking about ponies, what else are you interested in?
<Books> other then murder?
<Books> :D
<Jenemmy> UMMMM
<Jenemmy> Weeellll
<Jenemmy> I doooo liikkekee
<Jenemmy> -pause-
<Jenemmy> St-stuff.
<Books> >_>
<Jenemmy> BRB
<Jenemmy> i messied my bed with fooc
<Jenemmy> 8food
<Jenemmy> **food
<Books> ..okay.
<Jenemmy> Idea!
<Jenemmy> What's something you HATE?
<Jenemmy> Wanna rant about it?
<Books> hmm...
<Books> Well, I've been trying, even before MLP not to hate things "out loud"
<Books> or at least not think about what I hate...
<Jenemmy> It's only me.
<Jenemmy> Besides, if it bottles up, you might release hate on a friend.
<Jenemmy> D:
<Books> No, I mean it's hard for me to tihnk of someting I actually hate
<Jenemmy> And friendship is magic, dawg.
<Books> D:
<Jenemmy> Oh.
<Jenemmy> Know what I hate?
<Jenemmy> WIND.
<Jenemmy> Cannot stand it.
<Books> ..wind?
<Books> waht's wrong with wind?
<Jenemmy> Pushing me in directions I don't wanna go and whatnot!
<Books> lol
<Jenemmy> It makes everything 20% cooler (literally)
<Jenemmy> I just dislike wind.
<Jenemmy> The End :>
<Books> Exactly 20%
<Jenemmy> :3
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> Hmmmmmmmmm
<Jenemmy> Disuss...pony?
<Books> I'm always up for that, but we both know we both love ponies
<Books> I was hoping on talking about something else with you, since we seem to have a lot in common
<Books> but what you're comfortable with.
<Jenemmy> Okay!
<Jenemmy> That's fine with me
<Jenemmy> I'm an expendable person.
<Jenemmy> Common interests?
<Books> Exept I'm fairly terrible at starting conversations in a non-blunt way
<Books> like any anime?
<Books> tv shows?
<Books> recent movies?
<Books> musics?
<Jenemmy> Death Note, Melancholy of Haruhi, Lucky Star
<Books> fuck yeah death note
<Books> pro-kira or pro-law?
<Jenemmy> Not too much of a tv person, but I like Amazing World of Gumball, Spongebob, and Ponies
<Jenemmy> movies...
<Jenemmy> no.
<Jenemmy> WAIT
<Jenemmy> I wanna see rise of the planet of the apes!
<Jenemmy> I love Avril Lavigne and Blood on the Dance Floor.
<Jenemmy> We can talk about whatever subject you want nao.
<Jenemmy> :P
<Jenemmy> I gave you a whole bunch of ideas.
<Books> ...Pro kira or pro law? (death note)
<Jenemmy> Pro-Lawliet.
<Books> A shame.
<Jenemmy> Eh
<Jenemmy> Kira is very clever.
<Books> Light is a genius.
<Jenemmy> I just find L's attention to detail and sweets charming.
<Jenemmy> Light is a genius.
<Jenemmy> I will not deny it
<Books> Kira is not a person, it's an entity
<Books> anyone who kills in the name of kira
<Books> is kira
<Jenemmy> Yes.
<Jenemmy> You are right
<Books> L is a childish decective who want's to be right.
<Jenemmy> Childish.
<Jenemmy> Yes.
<Books> he hid his face long before he needed to.
<Books> no reason
<Jenemmy> That's exactly why I like him
<Jenemmy> man of mystery
<Books> Light wants to change the world.
<Jenemmy> He does
<Jenemmy> But death is not the way
<Books> crime rates down by over 80%, and 90% of wards abandonded
<Books> wars
<Jenemmy> Light wants to be God.
<Jenemmy> Light is NOT God.
<Books> why not?
<Books> People accept him as a god
<Books> he is a god to them
<Jenemmy> Because
<Jenemmy> Light is simply upon simple luck
<Jenemmy> *used simple twice
<Jenemmy> TAKE TWO
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Books> so did L, when trying to track down light
<Jenemmy> Light just had a stroke of luck.
<Ray> 02Hereee... for not long
<Dusky> 06:3
<Jenemmy> But L is not trying to take the place of an almighty ruler.
<Books> no, he is trying to keep the world exactly the way it was
<Books> a rotten mess
<Jenemmy> Light shows no mercy, and kills every criminal in his path.
<Books> Light didn't want to be a god, we wanted to change the world
<Jenemmy> Regardless of their story
<Books> he accepted glory when it was given to him
<Jenemmy> Or reasonin
<Books> to prove a point to everyone else,
<Books> that crimes will not be forgicen
<Books> it worked
<Jenemmy> You hold a valid arugment sir, and I applaud you for that.
<Books> Likewise ma'am.
<Jenemmy> But death upon thousands is not the way to fix the world
<Books> I'm glad we can debate with issue.
<Books> Why not?
<Jenemmy> The way to fix the world is through understanding and compromise.
<Books> there are alread issue with population
<Books> and issues with the population doing bad things
<Ray> 02lol, bbl
<Books> he would probably love to change the wold with understanding
<Ray> 02Kthxbai
<Books> maybe he would, if he never got the death note
<Jenemmy> The population is irrelevant to the storyline
<Books> but he was given the power of death
<Books> how else is he goign to change the world when his best weapon is lethel?
<Books> it made due.
<Jenemmy> Yet he did not kill those determined by one who studied those criminals for many years.
<Books> At first he was sickened by the fact that he killed someone
<Jenemmy> He killed any criminal in his path
<Books> he killed all criminals to prove a point
<Jenemmy> Besides, if Light's plan is to "work" (I haven't finished the series. Got to L dying)
<Books> he found it neccicary
<Jenemmy> Then there will be no balance.
<Books> what do you mean
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> A world filled with all "good" people.
<Jenemmy> These criminals are here for a reason.
<Books> ?
<Books> There doesn't need to be a balence
<Jenemmy> Killing all of them off would destroy the world
<Books> It didn't.
<Books> after L died it skipped to the future a couple years
<Jenemmy> Policemen would be unnecessary and thousands wuld be out of work
<Jenemmy> Continue.
<Books> there were still some crimes
<Books> like hate-crimes
<Books> things that are just sudden,
<Books> and the killer isn't thinking
<Books> just less pre-meditated murders
<Jenemmy> How so?
<Books> less cops, yes, but we don't rely on criminals for our employment
<Jenemmy> Weren't all of those people live
<Books> how so what?
<Jenemmy> Ugh
<Jenemmy> Fail grammar
<Books> sorry
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> Weren't those people killed by Light?
<Books> no, not from before
<Books> people wreestill comitting crimes
<Books> light would kill them, but he didn't stop crime
<Books> is what I am saying
<Books> crime will always exist when people do
<Jenemmy> So he killed many for know good reason
<Jenemmy> You're saying it yourself; he killed many people and crime still exists.
<Books> the reason was to keep the peace he had created
<Books> 80% crime rate drop
<Books> that's a lot of crimes
<Jenemmy> He may have saved a few lives but it will come tumbling down come his death
<Jenemmy> Or whatever happens to him.
<Jenemmy> No heaven nor hell, dunno where to go.
<Jenemmy> Immortality?
<Books> NU
<Books> is what they said
<Books> a place where dead peopel went
<Books> it was ntohingness
<Books> nothing at all
<Jenemmy> Big white space, basically.
<Books> black, but sure.
<Jenemmy> Still: that crime drop affected the world for a few short years.
<Jenemmy> People were living in fear of death
<Books> yes, but after he stopeed killing, people starting commiting crimed again
<Jenemmy> The world was made a dirty old trashbag for a reason.
<Books> people tend to see themselves seperatly from criminals
<Books> to the point where it's "people and criminals"
<Jenemmy> Let's just end this
<Books> ?
<Jenemmy> Light lets L look through the death note.
<Jenemmy> L gives Light a cupcakes.
<Jenemmy> Hugs
<Books> But....
<Jenemmy> Friendship
<Jenemmy> Magic
<Books> I don't like L.
<Jenemmy> I can see that.
<Jenemmy> Did you see the dub or sub
<Books> I read the manga.
<Books> as it was coming out
<Jenemmy> Better
<Books> -hipster glasses=
<Jenemmy> I'm just saying
<Books> I liked kira before he became a god and sold out to the people-
<Jenemmy> We're repeating ourselves
<Books> Nah, I get it
<Jenemmy> Neither of us will win
<Books> it ends up being a loop argument
<Books> boiling down to personal morals of if it's okay to kill
<Jenemmy> We both hold valid arguments, and the answer is based on opinion.
<Books> and the definition of happiness, whatnot.
<Jenemmy> Exactly
<Books> I'm glad we can agree on that.
<Books> This was fun.
<Jenemmy> That's like saying "the moon" to aliends
<Jenemmy> *aliens
<Jenemmy> There are many moons on other planets
<Jenemmy> Some may think you mean one, while another the other.
<Books> "why do you sound... nothern?" "lots of planets have a north!"
<Books> sorry, first thing I thought of.
<Jenemmy> lol
<Jenemmy> It's okay
<Books> I'm not that huge on anime, but I've seen haruhi
<Books> enjoyable, not sure if it was actually good, but i enjoyed it.
<Books> Honestly, I never watched any cartoons when I was younger
<Jenemmy> hm
<Books> or even revently, I just really like MLP
<Jenemmy> Okay
<Jenemmy> What time is it where you are?
<Books> 7:32
<Jenemmy> Same
<Jenemmy> I stayed up all night
<Jenemmy> I need some rest
<Books> I am taking a test at a college tomorrow to see what classes I can take
<Books> This should be interesting
<Books> having not slept
<Books> at all
<Jenemmy> okay
<Jenemmy> I keep drifting
<Books> aw
<Books> :/
<Books> :(
<Books> wrong faces
<Jenemmy> lol
<Books> if you wanted to sleep, I won't be offended or anything
<Jenemmy> I think I'm seeing things
<Books> you have my youtube, so that's something
<Jenemmy> I really need to get to bed
<Jenemmy> Be here mobie ight?

<Dusky> 06no problem, with me navigating everything...:P
<prince-dari> BBL
<FlutterHi> BBL?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Nick> hai Roara
*Nick dumps game boys all over her
*Aurora grabs nearest game boy color and plays crystal version
<Nick> Kosovo told me they'll be releasing pokemon red n blue on 3DS eshop soon apparantly
<Aurora> wow lol
<Aurora> I still want a proper Pokemon Snap 2
<Nick> YES
<Aurora> rumor has it that the next pokemon game will be in 3D style (as in like pokemon coluseum as opposed to the normal RPG games)
<Aurora> apparently game freak was looking for someone with 3D modeling experience, and it was said that it was for their next game
<Aurora> course, I didn't really look much into the story
<Aurora> so I dunno, that probably is just rumor
<Pegacorn> @alivemeter This chat
<Steven_Magnet> 6 This chat is 47% alive. (300)
<Nick> I also doubt it'll be a main stream pokemon series game
<HyperMetalLugia> It won't xD
<Aurora> nah, but if it really were a second pokemon snap game
<Aurora> oooohohohohoho
<Nick> its strange how snap is so well loved, on paper taking photos of pokemon sounds boring
<abronylikeyou> hi
<Nick> but it played really well
<Aurora> yeah
<Aurora> it did
<Aurora> and it only had like....60 pokemon total
<Aurora> at most
<Aurora> if they made a proper one with over a couple hundred
<Aurora> can you imagine
<Aurora> how fun
<Aurora> that would be
<SheenaFox> Yes
<Nick> have you ever played endless ocean for wii roara? (or preferably the second)
<Aurora> no, I wanted to though
<Aurora> for some weird reason, it looked fun
<Pegacorn> Ohai abronylikeyou
<Nick> since it has a camera function but with zoom and depth of field abilities, plus free roaming
<Nick> snap can learn a lot of lessons from it
<Nick> like snap you can slap sharks too so you get them to bite :D
<Nick> I WOULD SO DO THAT MYSELF IF I DID DOVE
<Aurora> I'm currently amusing myself by roaming around game freak's website
<Nick> but yeah that was also like snap with the apples
<Aurora> I /was/ looking for the employment page to see if I could find that little bit about hiring a 3D designer
<Aurora> but I've found a ton of images from inside the company
<Dusky> 06Darky: *hugs Nick* SHADOW LUGIA HUG!
<Aurora> with cnocept art and stuff
*Dusky runs
<Nick> o.o
<Nick> IT BURRNS!
<Nick> also why you hoping for the job roara?
<Aurora> LOL I'm not
<HyperMetalLugia> Rora would be a great CGI designer xD
<Aurora> I'm just curious, especially since the job had a picture of a 3D modeled lugia as an example of what they'll need to be able to do
<Aurora> LOL THIS PICTURE
<Aurora> it's from a small meeting or something
<Aurora> everyone's asian except this one guy
<Dusky> 06COFFEE
<Dusky> 06DONUTS
<Dusky> 06GREAT MEETING!
*Dusky runs
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Nick> oh 3d model lugia?! o.o
<Nick> link when you find it!
<Aurora> http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/common/images/til_employindex.jpg
<Dusky> 06i hope it was a shadow lugia :D
<Aurora> that's the meeting I'm talking about lol
<Aurora> and yeah lemme find the lugia
<Nick> might it be a upgrade to the 3Dex?
<Aurora> http://flyingfisch.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/outline_pt01.jpg?w=320&h=216
<Aurora> possibly
<Aurora> and that would make some sense, but did game freak work on 3Ddex?
<Nick> awesome! @ pic and Im not sure (checks his 3DS)
<Polarfire> anybody here?
<Aurora> game freak doesn't usually do the spin offs
<Aurora> only the mainstream
<Nick> yeah
<Polarfire> well in that case...

<Bjornfot> I use some special stuff for special hair from the drug store
<Kosoveon> I was really worried about it for a while
<Sathi> 7ah :) guess what i'm listening to....
<Dusky> 06good one Kosoveon!
<Polarfire> hmm
<Polarfire> I don't know you that well
<Aurora> lo congrats
<Polarfire> so I give up.
<Aurora> what scores did you get?
<Nick> gratz kosoho!
<Sathi> 7it's Bjornfot singing winter wrap-up
<Bjornfot> Wait, Polarfire... ain't you a guy?
<Polarfire> yes?
<Kosoveon> thanks guys
<Polarfire> :s
<Kosoveon> I got a 4 on my US History and English exams, a 3 on my Physics
<DSD|Away> ok
<Kosoveon> I totally thought I'd bomb the physics one lol
<Bjornfot> just found it a but funny that you said my hair was beautiful x3
<Aurora> 6everyone thinks that too
<Bjornfot> but i shouldn't
<Aurora> 6yet 70% wind up passing
<Bjornfot> because stereotypes and gender roles are evil :c
<Kosoveon> in our school the passing rate is 33%
<Aurora> 6but that's really good though, was that english language and comp or lit and com?
<Polarfire> humor was the target with that comment :3
<EccoCode> congrats Kosovo (a little late).
<Aurora> 6comp
<Polarfire> but your hair really is cool.
<Kosoveon> thanks ecco
<Kosoveon> and it was com
*Kosoveon was a junior when he took the exams
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6both are com
<Kosoveon> uh
<Aurora> 6ok, thats languange and composition
<Kosoveon> comp
<Aurora> 6comp
<Kosoveon> right
<Aurora> 6gtdh
<Kosoveon> XD
<Aurora> 6both are comp
<Aurora> 6but language is junior level, literature is senior
<Kosoveon> ok, my eyes are blanking out
<Kosoveon> ok
*Bjornfot just realized that both a boy and a girl complimented his looks and singing voice
<Kosoveon> language XDDDD
<Bjornfot> likeaboss.jpg
<Aurora> 6but yeah, language was fairly difficult LOL
<Polarfire> you need shades.
<Aurora> 6there was stuff in there I was like....WTF IS THIS D:
<Aurora> 6it only gets funner in literature and composition
<Aurora> 6>>
*Polarfire slaps bjornfot a around a bit with a large trout.
<Kosoveon> the essays were really just...ugh
<Bjornfot> I guess you could say... that I am... *sunglasses* bi-winning
<Kosoveon> the material I had to write about was the least exciting possible
<Bjornfot> YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
<Polarfire> I'm not gay.
<Polarfire> but your hair is still awesome.
<Bjornfot> ofcourse you're not
<Kosoveon> especially the synthesis essay
<Kosoveon> which was about locavores
<Aurora> 6same
<Bjornfot> being gay is just as silly as being straight
<Aurora> 6lol my synthesis essay was about whether or not we should keep the penny as a form of money
<Aurora> 6which isn't too bad of a topic
<Aurora> 6until you realize "crap HOW MANY PAGES do I have to write again?"
<Aurora> 6that topic is so hard to drag out into 3 pages
<Aurora> 6let alone longer
<Kosoveon> it's really tempting just to keep it to the generic 3 or 5 paragraph outline
<Kosoveon> but 3 or 5 paragraphs a 3 page essay does not make
<Polarfire> HEY WHATPAYNE
<Polarfire> talk to us
<DSD|Away> bye bye
<Aurora> 6have you ever learned the schafer paragraph style?
<WhatPayne> ewhat?
<Aurora> 6</spelling>
<Bjornfot> Also, subscribe to my channel, mofos.
<Kosoveon> isn't that the five sentence per graph thing
<Kosoveon> *paragraph
<Aurora> 6I love how that was very very VERY heavily emphasized in my freshman and sophomore years................and then junior year my teacher said "yeah um...you'll never EVER use that again, and if you do, you'll fail"
<Aurora> 6yeah
<WhatPayne> hello, beautiful weather we are having.
<Kosoveon> *sentences
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Polarfire> yes.
<Polarfire> well.
<Polarfire> its raining : /
<Kosoveon> yeah it's like when in elementary they tell you to start off certain essays with a question
<WhatPayne> It's hot as hell here. I'd like some rain.
<Kosoveon> but if you actually do that on the ap exam
<Polarfire> It was 105 yesterday.
<Kosoveon> they say you look like an idiot
<Polarfire> plus about 50 to 60% humitidy.
<Polarfire> and now its raining -.-
<WhatPayne> um... That's quite lot more than what I'm experiencing...
<Kosoveon> like "Have you ever heard of the industrial revolution?" when talking about child labor in the 1900s
<Polarfire> what is your temp?
<Kosoveon> eight years ago my teacher totally would have suggested that, but if I asked my english teacher last year if that was good he'd literally laugh his head off
<Polarfire> where you're at
<WhatPayne> Fahrenheit?
<WhatPayne> about 85...
<Polarfire> what counrty are you from?
<WhatPayne> Finland
<Kosoveon> so basically I've been rewriting habits instill in me since first grade
<Kosoveon> *instilled
<Polarfire> oh XD
<Aurora> 6yep
<WhatPayne> I... We are not that accustomed to hot temperatures.
<Polarfire> yeah summers are pretty deadly where I'm at.
<Aurora> 6thats actually why I suck at writing noe
<Aurora> 6now
<Aurora> 6habits from early years are so hardwired into my brain
<Aurora> 6I can't really get out of it
<Polarfire> it sucks
<WhatPayne> 105 F? Without AC I'd be dead.
<Polarfire> hooray for ac :3
<WhatPayne> The best thing since sliced bread.
<Polarfire> hmm
<WhatPayne> Or something like that...
<Polarfire> is finland a lot like the us?
<Polarfire> that's one of my favorite "sayings"
<WhatPayne> In what way?
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Polarfire> I'm not sure.
<Kosoveon> I kind of had the same probably with the history exam, but in a different way
<Polarfire> I just thought most sayings were pretty region-specific
<Polarfire> but I guess not.
<Polarfire> but that's enough ramblings.
<WhatPayne> Uh, we have high living of standard. High education. Really cold winters... We love American television.
<Polarfire> lol
<Kosoveon> because back in elementary/junior high my teachers told me when writing an claim-based history essay that it's okay to glorify whatever you're supporting
<Bjornfot> oh you silly finns
<Aurora> 6oh god
<WhatPayne> Think of Sweden, but slightly more to east
<Bjornfot> there's nothing to like about USA
<Kosoveon> but my history teacher from last year told me that was too flowery or whatever
<Kosoveon> so like
<Kosoveon> when talking about the new deal
<Bjornfot> also, you have far less muslims
<Polarfire> the movies are pretty cool.
<Kosoveon> people would just talk about the good it did, and none of the bad
<Bjornfot> kinda
<WhatPayne> For the moment... Our immigration policies are too loose for many people's likings.
<Bjornfot> but Scandinavia is pretty well known for not liking USA
<Kosoveon> that's part of why the exam was difficult for me, because i was really only taught the good it did
<WhatPayne> That's not true.
<Bjornfot> HA!
<Kosoveon> barely any of the bad
<Bjornfot> Just look at Sweden.
<Bjornfot> THIS is fucking loose!
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Bjornfot> :c
<Bjornfot> 10% of swedens population is immigrants
<WhatPayne> Bjornfot you are from Sweden?
<Bjornfot> ja
<Kosoveon> but anyways, bbl XD
<Bjornfot> We were once the richest country in nothern europe
<WhatPayne> ok... Yeah. Some say that we must avoid that what happened to Sweden with immigration.
<Kosoveon|Away> gonna see if they have the 3DS charger thing at gamestop
<Bjornfot> now we're below average in europe thanks to our socialistic politics and massive immigration
<Kosoveon|Away> that extends the battery life
<Bjornfot> Finland is now king of the hill
<Aurora> 6o.o
<Bjornfot> And yeah - don't repeat our mistake.
<Aurora> 6extends?
<Aurora> 6never heard of that lol
<Kosoveon|Away> yeah
<Kosoveon|Away> as in if you attach it to the back of the 3DS it doubles the battery life
<Kosoveon|Away> makes it more bulky but i honestly don't care lol
<Aurora> 6o.o
<Aurora> 6thats pretty legit lol
<Bjornfot> I mean, this is crazy.
<Polarfire> Bjornfot who has more muslims than who?
<Polarfire> excuse me for not knowing that much about scandinavia :S
<WhatPayne> The immigration problem plagues most of EU.
<HyperMetalLugia> I have it
<Bjornfot> We don't have nearly enough jobs for those finishing school each year
<HyperMetalLugia> The nyko one is good :3
<WhatPayne> No problem, Polarfire.
<Bjornfot> nor do we have enough houses for everyone wanting to move away from mom and dad
<Polarfire> hmm
<Bjornfot> and our economy is a national low
<Polarfire> sounds like you guys are worse off than us :S
<Bjornfot> we can't afford giving the elderly proper pension and care
<Bjornfot> despite all this
<WhatPayne> Well Scandinavian countries don't have same problems with housing as US.
<WhatPayne> Yet...
<Bjornfot> We INSIST on taking in AS MANY IMMIGRANTS AS POSSIBLE
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Bjornfot> we're #1 most immigrant friendly in the world
<WhatPayne> Our politicians are trying to do the same here.
<Bjornfot> that would not really be a problem
<Polarfire> the housing market over here is bad right now.
<Bjornfot> except that we give each and every one of them FREE HOMES, FREE STUFF, FREE MONEY
<WhatPayne> Exactly!
<Bjornfot> they are not even ALLOWED to get a job
<Polarfire> For the first time in over a century, housing prices dropped about 25%.
<Polarfire> here.
<Polarfire> in 2008
<Bjornfot> because they're forced to re-take school in swedish first
<Polarfire> and now, I forget the exact number,
<WhatPayne> It's the social welfare which draws people form poorer mostly Muslim countries to live under the wing of those working and paying taxes.
<Polarfire> but I think Its about 20% of all homes are vacant.
<Bjornfot> and when they than can't get a job, because guess what - THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE JOBS - we just continue giving them social penny
<Polarfire> Bjornfot you should be a politician.
<Bjornfot> no
<Bjornfot> they will just say that i'm racist
<Polarfire> you explain things well and you are very level-headed.
<Polarfire> Which is what most politicians aren't.
<Bjornfot> everyone who don't want to spend humungus amounts of money on immigration is a racist, you see
<WhatPayne> Which is why we have this problem. If you refuse taking immigrants you get stigmatized as racist.
<WhatPayne> And none wants to be racist.
<Bjornfot> we do it because we want to look "good"
<Dman> 0_o Do what?
<Polarfire> hey Dman.
<Dman> Hai Polarfire!
<WhatPayne> Hello
<Polarfire> what's up?
<Bjornfot> mass immigration
<Dman> hi whatpayne
<WhatPayne> Talking politics.
<Dman> Not much :P
<Dman> i'm about to work on something that i'm sure Bronystate will be using quite a bit. Gonna be a lot of work thou
<Polarfire> I heard about that.
<Bjornfot> what is it?
<WhatPayne> hm? Colour me intrigued.
<Aristeo> Skah!! <3
<Dman> It's for prince-dari's Trivia script
<Bjornfot> An anti-muslim forcefield?
<Polarfire> :3
<Bjornfot> x3
<Dman> oh you
<WhatPayne> lol what?
<Polarfire> What questions do you have so far?
<WhatPayne> BTW Are there any muslim Bronies?
<Polarfire> :P
<Bjornfot> there must be some
<WhatPayne> I guess...
<Bjornfot> there are almost more muslims than christians in sweden
<Bjornfot> maybe not many in muslim countries
<Bjornfot> but there are muslims all over europe
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Bjornfot> why are you asking?
<Bjornfot> it's not like they are evil
<WhatPayne> I'm wondering out loud here...
<Bjornfot> although USA wants us to think that
<Dusky> 06heya Chimera
<Polarfire> I don't think they are evil.
<WhatPayne> Like we say here. Problem is not immigration, problem is Islam.
<Bjornfot> lolwut
<Polarfire> but a lot of terrorists are muslim.
<Bjornfot> really payne
<Polarfire> muslim extremists that is.
<WhatPayne> Well the truth in my opinion is that problem is the Economic refugees who do not want to even try to adapt.
<Bjornfot> well, if you look back in the time, many christians were not much better
<drf|away> 02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
<Apokalipse> Hello
<Polarfire> yeah...
<WhatPayne> HI
<Bjornfot> true payne
<Polarfire> ohai marl
<Apokalipse> many christians were not much better than what if you don't mind me asking?
<Polarfire> Muslims, as far as terrorism goes.
<Apokalipse> ah
<Bjornfot> muslim-extremists
<Polarfire> Welcome to armchair politics, Brony edition.
<WhatPayne> I guess US does not have the immigration problem since there is no social welfare?
<Bjornfot> ^
<Polarfire> We do have some immigration issues.
<Polarfire> but not like what you describe.
<Bjornfot> you have a really huge dept though?
<Polarfire> Many immigrate illegally, work for a few months, then break the law and get a free ride back to their home country.
<Polarfire> yes we have a HUGE debt.
<RainBroDash> 10Lurkan RBD is stealan all Bjornfot's dox
<WhatPayne> Well at least they work.
<Bjornfot> thanks to your useless warring
<Polarfire> OHAI RAINBRO
<RainBroDash> 10your youtube is mine.
<Bjornfot> lolwu
<RainBroDash> 10I R STALK NAO KTHXBAI
<Bjornfot> oooooooooooooookay
<RainBroDash> 10shh
<RainBroDash> 10HAI POLARFIRE
<RainBroDash> 10How's it going? :3
<WhatPayne> I'm scared...
<Polarfire> yeah, they work, but they still take advantage of our jobs.
<Polarfire> Its kinda annoying but not a huge huge problem like the debt is.
<Bjornfot> then stop waging war
<Polarfire> and rainbro I am doing great. What about you man?
<WhatPayne> I'm not touching that.
<Polarfire> what?
<Polarfire> go ahead.
<WhatPayne> The whole war thing? It's really convoluted.
<RainBroDash> 10Polarfire I am doing just fine and dandy thank ye very much :D
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> and that's good rainbro :3
<RainBroDash> 10been chillin at a mate's house; gaming for days
<RainBroDash> 10basically I have the best life right now
<Polarfire> XD
<RainBroDash> 10:>
<Polarfire> lucky.
<RainBroDash> 10I know right
<RainBroDash> 10part of me feels bad for flaunting it
<Polarfire> well as far as the war goes, OBL is dead so I don't see what they are waiting on.
<RainBroDash> 10but the other part is all OHOHO I LOVE LIFE
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> lol
<Polarfire> the whole terrorist network is a mess.
<Polarfire> Its a big network of people mixed in with innocent civilians.
<NightSeas> 12Hello Lightumbreon
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey GL
<Polarfire> The operate under cover, and move around a lot,
<Polarfire> making them a very difficult target.
<NightSeas> 12Hia HML :3
<WhatPayne> Tell me about it... Or more importantly tell the Norwegians.
<Polarfire> There is no definite enemy.
<Dusky> 06heya GL :3
<Polarfire> how do you fight that?
<Polarfire> Its like trying to fight the Anonymous.
<Polarfire> You can't
<Polarfire> you can't just blow them up because they are right there with the innocent people.
<Polarfire> They have nothing for you to target.
<WhatPayne> I know...
<Polarfire> If you kill 1, 5 more move in to replace him and the network moves on like nothing happens.
<Polarfire> bjornfot y u leave? D:
<WhatPayne> We'll they say that al qaeda has lost a lot of it's strength.
<WhatPayne> *Well
<Polarfire> yeah.
<WhatPayne> But ponies are still awesome no matter what.
<Polarfire> but the thing is they will regain their strength almost immediately if the military leaves
<Polarfire> because the middle east is so corrupt.
<Polarfire> And yes, ponies are the best thing since AC and sliced bread.
<Polarfire> :3
<Polarfire> ohai DCD
<Apokalipse> I agree with that
<NewDCD> whoa
<Polarfire> are you going to stream something for us? :3
<NewDCD> loads of people for a dead hour

<NewDCD> I WARN YOU THOUGH
<NewDCD> tonight's stream
<NewDCD> is going to be
<Polarfire> what will it be?
<NewDCD> ....bizzare doesn't cut it
<NewDCD> let's just say I lost a bet

<Polarfire> I can't wait.
<Apokalipse> Oh... Now I'm curious

<Bjornfot> what'd i miss? HUH HUH HUH!?
<NewDCD> ...and Ivy Valentine.....
<Bjornfot> WOO, DCD!
<NewDCD> ...and the Queen's Blade Characters.
<NewDCD> yes
<NewDCD> this is going to be risque. So you've been warned
<Bjornfot> does this mean that there will be streaming?
<Apokalipse> sure does
<NewDCD> I'm playing though it right now, and all I can say is "Jeebus, Japan."
<NewDCD> 7 PM EST
*Bjornfot grabs popcorn
<Bjornfot> ...awwwww
<Apokalipse> It's happened many times... I see something bizzare and wonder what the hell
<NewDCD> at that time, we'll play "LET'S SEE HOW QUICKLY A QUEEN'S BLADE GAME CAN OFFEND OUR SENSITIVITIES!"
<Apokalipse> But then I see it's from Japan
<Apokalipse> and all is explained
<NewDCD> additionally
<NewDCD> you might want to bring some booze
<NewDCD> take a shot every time someone's clothes rip or there's fanservice, if you're brave

<Skah> Hi.
<Nick> its a bit sad though people make websites and protests with the sole intention of trying to insult a product or company...
<Nick> what they should be protesting about is the ever increasing charges for video games and online gaming and trying to kill off cheaper pre-owned games *runs*
<NewDCD> so yeah
<NewDCD> you've been warned
<NewDCD> tonight's stream might offend sensitivities
<Bjornfot> rly?
<Bjornfot> This is going to be SO. AWESOME!
<Zoroark> casualization of video games
<Zoroark> though i'm pretty much a casual :V
<Nick> aka Wii/Kinect?
<Dman> NewDCD, is there any way I can contact prince-dari?
<Zoroark> Yeah, those things. That reminds me of something I saw the other day.
<Zoroark> I saw something about a new pod racer game, and it reminded me of Star Wars Episode 1 racing on the N64
<Nick> actually another thing is the degradation of single player games in favour of online multiplayer. This is one thing COD I can safely say is guilty for, however the best suspect is homefront
<Zoroark> Then I read "Kinect" and I was like "NOOOOOO"
<Nick> LOL I know the one you mean
<Nick> actually wii is ok, its just no good games for it since maybe SMG2 (which was a clone of the first basically)
<Zoroark> >mfw i'm wearing a SMG shirt right now
<Zoroark> >mfw I don't have SMG
<Zoroark> >mfw i don't have a face
<Cat> mew
*Cat hugs Skah
<HyperMetalLugia> o,o
<Nick> I didn't like the second tbh, it was an actual Nintendo made Mario game that didn't feel fresh...quite a feat really
<Zoroark> smg + yoshi = smg2
<Nick> now we're getting all the remakes too, OoT, SF64, MGS3 for 3DS
<Zoroark> isn't it
<Zoroark> >3ds
<Zoroark> nope
*Skah huggles Cat.
<Skah> Hi!
<Cat> meow
<Cat> sup?
<Nick> even though I'm gonna get all of them, I'm just annoyed by three things in games today; increasing and multiplying costs (game cost+online sub+online pass code=MORE MONEY FOR US! *devs*)
<Zoroark> give me one example of a 3ds game that isn't a sequel or a remake. :V
<Zoroark> er
<Zoroark> good 3ds game
<Aurora> 6lol
<HyperMetalLugia> The cowboy armadillo one?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Nick> two, increasingly lackluster SP games in favour for racist, anger fuelled 12 year old filled MP online (and tbh I don't get any enjoyment out of MP anymore)
<Nick> and third remakes/reboots
<Zoroark> I would argue something along the lines of "upkeep costs" but MS isn't like in need of money or anything, and Sony obviously just provides it free.
<Zoroark> And Nintendo.
<Nick> actually OoT3D is good, very good @ Zoroark it's just that timeless game plus seeing the Ocarina characters in HD and 3D was a treat. But yeah otherwise very valid point
<Zoroark> I actually have XBL for like 6 more months
<Zoroark> I got a year's subscription at like 40% off
<Nick> oh and one more thing....all the good games coming out within a few months of each other >.> SF643D, MGS3D, Skyward Sword, GOW3, CODMW3, BF3, SR3 come out like in the last two or three months of the year!
<Nick> its gonna be a helluva expensive Xmas for parents
<Nick> didn't sony introduce a sub charge?
<Zoroark> I think there's a subscription service but I don't think it's mandatory to use to get online.
<Zoroark> I know you can pay for it.
<Nick> ok
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<Pegacorn> Anyone still here?
<Pegacorn> I wonder if Bjornfot is here.

<Nick> they actually made a movie about a board game?!
<Nick> and made the plot with aliens?
<Nick> look the alien ship even fires 'pegs' into the navy ships <<
<RDash> It seems like not much going on here right now.
<Pegacorn> Exactly
<Nick> I can definitely understand transformers and maybe G I Joe, but Battleship? Since the success of transformers every studio wants to make a movie on some hasbro brand
<RDash> Woah ^ "+++ RDash set to mode +xiw" Apparently I'm a mod now. Bow to me!
<Pegacorn> Well,it's either that,or being stuck with Bjornfot on the moon.*shudder*

<RDash> I think that the RP thing might've had something to do with my first pony related dream that I remembered.
<RDash> That's good at least
<Pegacorn> And what was that?
<RDash> Somepony turned off the gravity and I had to ride a bike for some reason. It made sense in the dream.
<Pegacorn> .....A bike.In SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
<Pegacorn> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!

<Dman> random info: last question done ' What colour glasses does Twist wear?'
<nickstr> AMAX certified AM stereo/FM stereo auto reverse cassette radio
<Dman> Answer it guys
<Dman> : D
<nickstr> the AM section sounds very much like FM does on most tuners
<drfsupercenter> 03interesting
<RDash> blue?
<nickstr> the trick is the RF bandwidth it looks at is much wider
<nickstr> 10 to 15 KHz on AM vs the 4.5 to 5 KHz most have
<drfsupercenter> 03so I saw this car the other day with a HUGE antenna, the guy obviously shoved like 3 normal sized antennas on there XD
<Pegacorn> Blue.
<nickstr> perhaps
<Pegacorn> Can you play my request prince-dari?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> Give me a minute.
<nickstr> I am testing the Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo decoder now
<Pegacorn> ok
*nickstr np: Sara Evans - Missing Missouri [04:16m/1042kbps/44kHz]
<nickstr> its working!
<drfsupercenter> 03I've also seen those license plates that say "Amateur radio"
<drfsupercenter> 03and lets them have a shorter number
<nickstr> well more like call letters
<nickstr> those are assigned to them by the FCC
<drfsupercenter> 03no, I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how a normal license plate is like ABC123?
<drfsupercenter> 03then there are ones that say things like Air Force, and let you have a 4 digit one
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<drfsupercenter> 03you can get amateur radio ones too
<nickstr> I could get an amateur radio plate
<nickstr> I qualify for one once I start driving
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL you don't drive yet?
<nickstr> not yet
<Pegacorn> Is it online now prince-dari?
<nickstr> the song I am listening to actually has a geographical reference only those who live or lived in Missouri would get
<nickstr> the most unique feature of the state known as the boot heel
<nickstr> geographically its unique
<prince-dari> Ok it's up now.
<Dashite> I've got no sound.
<Apokalipse> me neither
<RDash> same
<prince-dari> Meh, it always resets.
<prince-dari> I have to put it on manually.
<prince-dari> Sec.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Winter-puff> hey guy have i missed much?
<Pegacorn> Nope
<Dman> Does anypony have a good program to automatically save a chatroom as text?
<Winter-puff> kl kl and fraid not dman
<Dman> Oh well, winter-puff, thanks for replying ; )
<nickstr> no other state has anything like it
<Dashite> Some other IRC clients should have logging features. mIRC does.
<Pegacorn> Is it online now prince-dari?
<prince-dari> No, trying to work out why sound isn't working, it wasn't off.
<Pegacorn> Is it online now?

<drfsupercenter> 03well nah
<drfsupercenter> 03I copy the files to the hard drive
<drfsupercenter> 03then go to oplay them

<drfsupercenter> 03once I get the license, just run FairUse4WM to decrypt them
<drfsupercenter> 03>:P
<HyperMetalLugia> Profit?
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Apokalipse> ooooooh shiny buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03the thing is
<drfsupercenter> 03I have to use a virtual machine of Windows XP
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here
<drfsupercenter> 03as it's like, physically impossible to decrypt Windows Media on anything newer
<drfsupercenter> 03even on XP, you have to set it up specially
<drfsupercenter> 03and disable Windows Update
<drfsupercenter> 03or else it'll update the DRM and make it not work
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid Microsoft
*Quanyails 7meeps.
<Dman> i better hear at least one epicly used for epiclytimed moment OBJECTION, NewDCD, as as i have said i'm a huge fan of Ace Attourney ;D
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop can't update itself
<Quanyails> 7I'm going to be at Otakon tomorrow. :U
<HyperMetalLugia> What is thatr
<HyperMetalLugia> -r
<drfsupercenter> 03well Windows Updates in WIndows 7 actually work
<Quanyails> 7Well, the day after.
<drfsupercenter> 03Quanyails pix or gtfo
*drfsupercenter runs
<NewDCD> 9the game we're going to play is very OBJECTIONABLE so I suppose you will hear it
<Dman> : D
<Dman> although i cant watch for like 2 hours
<Dman> ok, here it is:
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf digital copy
<HyperMetalLugia> I like WU in 7, as I always select remind me in 4/9 hrs xD
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows says this 4GB DVD has CDFS
<drfsupercenter> 03>CD File System
<drfsupercenter> 03>Meant for CDs, not DVDs
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<Dman> I set up friend's projector to watch a jackie cahn film that just started, but his laptop derp'd so we're watching it from my laptop on projector
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail formatting much
<Dman> so i can be here, but not hear volume or it will be heard thru speakers
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, digital copy is the most pointless thing ever, but, if I can get it for free/very cheap, I like collecting them
<drfsupercenter> 03decrypted obviously, or it defeats the purpose
<Dashite> Which movie?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Derp
<Kosoveon> hi ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03and, decrypting Independence Day
<Dman> jackie chan the tuxedo aka for non brits the smokin'
<drfsupercenter> 03I, Robot will be next
<drfsupercenter> 03yay two movies that start with the same letter?
<HyperMetalLugia> Will Smith movies :O
<HyperMetalLugia> Or..
<HyperMetalLugia> NO
<HyperMetalLugia> Ern
<Dman> something all us here (about 6) wanna watch
<HyperMetalLugia> Forget it x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03Will Smith FTW though
<HyperMetalLugia> But yes, horray same letter movies
<HyperMetalLugia> I am derping today
<Dashite> Aw, old school jackie chan is best jackie chan.
*HyperMetalLugia has been playing too much Aemagetron
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that game awesome?
<drfsupercenter> 03I should install it on here
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh DRF
<Pegacorn> Jackie Chan is always best Jackie Chan
<HyperMetalLugia> Can I send you some audio samples
<HyperMetalLugia> Like, from the first TRON movie
<NewDCD> 9that movie isn't so oldschool
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Dman> yup! but i liked his role in karate kid eeven if he didn't do much. SO MUCH WISDOM
<NewDCD> 9I mean, Jennifer Love Hewitt was in it
<Dman> and like NewDCD says
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, for the game/bike sfx that is
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03what for
<Dman> there are way more oldschool movies with way better action
<HyperMetalLugia> Read up
<HyperMetalLugia> The game
<NewDCD> 9"Karate" Kid was actually a pretty good movie. It really would've been better as a standalone IP though
<Dashite> I know. I was saying his older stuff is better. Back when he could do all the crazy ass stunts himself.
<HyperMetalLugia> I lost it
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03no but I mean
<Dman> i think my fave movie is drunken master if i HAD to pik one
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you want to send me audio files
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't want to sell me death sticks, you want to go home and rethink your life
<NewDCD> 9I want us to watch oldschool John Woo sometime
<NewDCD> 9like The Assassin or For a Better Tomorrow
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL xD
<Dman> NewDCD i never thought of that! it's own title would have been amazing! but then critics would'a gone DERP THIS IS KUN' FOO KID
<HyperMetalLugia> Because you'd geek?
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03I Have the movie on DVD and Blu-Rasy
<drfsupercenter> 03-s
*Quanyails 7pokes Feather.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh good
<Dman> NewDCD - vote for it ! if you're pickd ;)
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<Dman> OR watch on a weekday with us!
<NewDCD> 9my first choice would be
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider THE FIRST tho'
<HyperMetalLugia> But ATA has terrible bike sfx anyway
<Dman> Ofc
<drfsupercenter> 03what the frick is wrong with my HD Radio
<HyperMetalLugia> HD radio o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03ye[/
<drfsupercenter> 03*yep
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it standalone or a PCI card thing?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's standalone
<drfsupercenter> 03as far as I know, they don't exist as PC cards
<drfsupercenter> 03but nickstr would have to clarify
<HyperMetalLugia> Check the kitchen :P
<nickstr> stand alone
<HyperMetalLugia> The microwave might be turned on again
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> HD Radio receivers are also known as IBOC-DAB receivers
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not getting any reception o-O
<nickstr> these are stand alone tuners

<drfsupercenter> 03and, here we go
<nickstr> is it working now?
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<nickstr> check your antenna
<drfsupercenter> 03it can't find any of the HD radio signals
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> you would be driven nuts if you were listening to FM in central Indiana
<drfsupercenter> 03why>?
<nickstr> most stations on the dial play country
<drfsupercenter> 03EW
<drfsupercenter> 03we have like 4 stations here now that play top 40 :>
<drfsupercenter> 03well, 106.7 is the one I listen to the most anymore
<nickstr> and its the same crap that is being plugged in the charts
<drfsupercenter> 03and that's "adult contempary"
<nickstr> but EWW RAP!
<drfsupercenter> 03so they play all sorts of stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03they were playing *NSYNC earlier XD
<nickstr> adult contemporary is a decent format
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<nickstr> but top 40 has gone to pot
<drfsupercenter> 03I quite like it
<drfsupercenter> 03they play rap on 106.7 too :P
<nickstr> central Indiana actually has Radio Disney on FM
<nickstr> sort of rare
<HyperMetalLugia> Brb, dinner
<drfsupercenter> 03uh, FM is the one that's a long wire that plugs into coaxial, right?
<nickstr> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03Why the frick is it not working
<nickstr> but usually that does not cut it for HD Radio
<drfsupercenter> 03I have the wire stretched out
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what came with the tuner...
<drfsupercenter> 03it used to work fine
<nickstr> bear in mind the IBOC subcarriers are about 1/100th the power of the main carrier
<nickstr> so you need a better antenna for reliable reception
<nickstr> I had that problem back in Washington
<nickstr> the HD Radio signals around me were weak with the exception of 104.3
<drfsupercenter> 03WHAT THE HECK
<drfsupercenter> 03It's not even working with *analog* FM radio
<drfsupercenter> 03something is majorly broken here
<nickstr> so I needed a big antenna for good reception
<nickstr> the antenna connector
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03no it's not
<drfsupercenter> 03though m
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> check it
<drfsupercenter> 03do you suppose rabbit ears would work?
<drfsupercenter> 03how?
<nickstr> does the connector wiggle considerably?
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<drfsupercenter> 03it's been plugged in for like a year
<drfsupercenter> 03just sitting on the shelf
<nickstr> sometimes its a firmware bug
<nickstr> try unpluging the radio and pluging it back in
<nickstr> these things are actually computers in disguise
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> they run custom firmware and have issues from time to time
<drfsupercenter> 03alright let me try
<nickstr> HD Radio receivers are actually SDR sets usually
<nickstr> SDR meaning software defined radio
<nickstr> but their demodulator settings cannot be changed by the end user
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03I wish I could just stream dump HD radio
<drfsupercenter> 03even if i have to convert it to something
<nickstr> you can't
<nickstr> PAC
<drfsupercenter> 03imagine if you have a computer card that just saves it as PCM
<drfsupercenter> 03PAC?
<nickstr> actually no not PAC
<nickstr> HDC
<nickstr> High Definition Coding
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I've heard of HDC
<nickstr> its a proprietary codec developed by Ibiquity
<nickstr> PAC is Perceptual Audio Coding
<nickstr> that is used for satellite radio
<drfsupercenter> 03THERE we go
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks that worked
<drfsupercenter> 03just unplugging it and plugging it in
<nickstr> no problem
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why it needed that
<nickstr> that is the first thing to tru
<drfsupercenter> 03guess because I haven't used it a year?
<nickstr> *try
<drfsupercenter> 03or more
<drfsupercenter> 03and see
<nickstr> might be a microprocessor burp
<nickstr> as I call them
<drfsupercenter> 03I know it's proprietary but I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03say you had one of the decoders
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than outputting as analog
<drfsupercenter> 03if it output as PCM
<drfsupercenter> 03to a computer
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03actually, mine has optical outpuit./
<drfsupercenter> 03*output
<drfsupercenter> 03so in theory, I could do something similar
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't have a way to process optical on my computer, only output it
<NewDCD> 9Everything's set up
<NewDCD> 9last warning, fillies: this is going to be a mindfuck in more ways than one
<nickstr> true
<Dman> NewDCD - aww! i can't watch it for anther hour or so! : (
<Dman> I hope your'es till here with dem buttonz in an hour
<Dman> Also, if you're here prince-dari, would it be possible to sort of try out the trivia script before friday at some point?
<Dman> Just to sorta check it out first. some questions might be too obvoius / hard
<drfsupercenter> 03fail
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm taping this antenna to my ceiling and I dropped the role of tape down the stairs
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom was like O_O
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid wire is like 10 feet long
<nickstr> you had the right idea trying to elevate it
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not stupid :P
<nickstr> that usually helps
<drfsupercenter> 03I just wish I could stick a PCI card into my computer and dump HD radio to something
<nickstr> rabbit ears would help a bit more though
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than needing this giant settop and then ripping over analog
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just stupid
<nickstr> but STAY AWAY FROM THE AMPLIFIED ONES!
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's still better than analog radio I suppose
<Cynder7> 6Why is it so dead these days? ._.
<nickstr> those can introduce noise into the RF signal and reduce the signal to noise ratio that the decoder is seeing
*drfsupercenter 06is watching 03»» 07I, Robot (Digital Copy) 03«» 0200:14:32 / 01:54:44 [0302,02|02,02|02,02|0203,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|03,03|02] 03«» 02~187.15KB/s (1.23GB) 03«» 02Windows Media Video 03«» 02MPClassic 03««
<nickstr> resulting in drop outs
<nickstr> if you need more gain you are better off with a roof top antenna
<nickstr> those provide a good deal of gain but they are passive
<nickstr> no amplifiers
<nickstr> thus no noise introduced
<drfsupercenter> 03alright, there we go
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really tacky but it will do for now
<drfsupercenter> 03I only really need to record a few songs off of 106.7 and then I can put the HD radio back away for a year XD
<nickstr> I don't use mine all that much for over the air FM
<Bjornfot> heeello?
<Pegacorn> Hi bjornfot
<nickstr> the Delco might get more use
<Dashite> OHAI
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03what is RDS?
<Pegacorn> You wanna come into the ponyRP channel Bjornfot?
<drfsupercenter> 03It switched from RDS to HD
<drfsupercenter> 03once it found a signal
<nickstr> Radio Data System
<NewDCD> 9are you fillies ready to be mindfucked in eight minutes?
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03what's that actually mean?
<NewDCD> 9also invite whomever doesn't value their sanity, as always
<nickstr> this is a 1,197 baud digital signal transmitted on an FM subcarrier
<Pegacorn> i am ready
<Bjornfot> oh yeah dcd
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn it
<Dman> Sadly no i can't =[ But I can't wait to read reactions!
<drfsupercenter> 03106.7 has crappy HD radio reception
<Creideiki> Isn't RDS quite rare in NA?
<nickstr> its text data mostly including some aditional bits which can be used for among other things traffic information
<nickstr> not anymore
<nickstr> its becoming more and more common
<nickstr> RDS is the comeback kid on FM
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/Ogo8s.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder if splitting the two ends up is what caused it to start losing signal;
<Creideiki> RDS is very, very popular in Europe (or at least something similar to RDS).
<drfsupercenter> 03had a great 4-bar signal for 95.5 but 106.7 basically doesn't have a HD radio signal at all
<Creideiki> (At least in Germany.)
<nickstr> it actually is RDS
*nickstr np: The Ramones - Blitzkrieg Bop [02:11m/128kbps/44kHz]
<Creideiki> (Last time I went, I was in a wonderfully boring Opel Astra, the radio had the ability to break into a music CD with traffic reports. Using RDS. :P )
<nickstr> EXTREME STEREO SEPARATION AHOY!
<nickstr> that meant a radio station was transmitting the traffic flag
<HyperMetalLugia> WB SKY
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<nickstr> a bit indicating traffic information being sent out by a radio station
<Creideiki> nickstr: Yes, I know. That's the point. The radio stations in Germany actually do that. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway nickstr did you see the picture?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> its a tacky setup
<nickstr> in more ways than one
<drfsupercenter> 03should I move the two ends closer together?
<drfsupercenter> 03or does that nolt really matter
<drfsupercenter> 03*not
<nickstr> move them further apart if anything
<NewDCD> 9five minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> what you have there is a half wave dipole antenna
<drfsupercenter> 03in English please
<Dman> =D
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah, 1067.7 has *no* HD radio signal now x.x
<nickstr> ideally you want the two elements to be a T shape
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<nickstr> well the whole antenna you want to be in a T shape
<drfsupercenter> 03so take the one end and make it cross the other?
<nickstr> no
<Creideiki> ...
<Creideiki> No.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm confused
*nickstr np: Ray Stevens - Misty [02:52m/925kbps/44kHz]
<drfsupercenter> 03got a picture of what it should look liek then?
<nickstr> no
<drfsupercenter> 03x.x
<nickstr> because its been years since I used an FM dipole
<Creideiki> Let me get a link.
<Creideiki> http://www.electronics-radio.com/articles/radio/antennas/dipole/half-wave-dipole.gif
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03so you mean the ends should be like | rather than < ?
<nickstr> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Creideiki> Yes, the angle between them should be 180.
<NewDCD> 9we're live
<Creideiki> (And with the feedline perpendicular to that.)
<Dashite> I hear you
<Apokalipse> I hear you
<drfsupercenter> 03That worked.
<drfsupercenter> 03Nice.
<drfsupercenter> 03I get a 4 bar signal again

<Dashite> Hmm... Iiiiinteresting....
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom got mad at me even for using Scotch tape
<drfsupercenter> 03saying it would rip the paint
<drfsupercenter> 03duct tape = NO
<Creideiki> (Do not staple into the wire, staple across.)
<Bjornfot> BEEWBS
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, I know how to staple wires.
<drfsupercenter> 03I did it for my home theater.
<Bjornfot> BEWBS
<drfsupercenter> 03but this is also thicker
<drfsupercenter> 03than speaker wire
<Bjornfot> srsly wtf
<Astray> MAI MOLESTED?
<drfsupercenter> 03and this is a temporary solution
<Bjornfot> also, no subs?
<Dashite> B00Bs, B00Bs, lack of B00Bs.
<Creideiki> Well, you can do what many a very lazy HAM has done...
<Creideiki> Say "Hello" to PVC pipe. :P

<Astray> LOOK
<Astray> TITS
<Link> NS! *glomp* :3
<Dashite> TITS! TITS EVERYWHERE!
<Creideiki> For that solution, all you need is: 1 length of PVC pipe, 1 PVC T-fitting for the pipe, two pipe brackets, glue, device capable of cutting pipe.
<Astray> also
<Astray> >yfw the alternate clothing
<Astray> also bro

<J-Lugia> hi Kos
<Dman> wait wat c
<NewDCD> 9and the worst part
<Dman> >clothing damage
<Pattyrick> Hi J
<NewDCD> 9clothing damage is actually something you should do
<Dman> lul
<NewDCD> 9because it allows you to do a bonus attack every time you break something
<J-Lugia> hi Pat
<Pattyrick> Yay, the old, fun-loving Ascendant is back
<Pattyrick> *runs*
<NewDCD> 9it doesn't actually show any genitalia, but still

<Kosoveon> !shipping
<Skylands> 4 Kosoveon is paired with Hawkie
<nickstr> careful saying that around me
<nickstr> I like a number of things Sony has made
*Quanyails 7suddenly hmms randomly.
<Quanyails> 7I can't think of anyone I'm currently fangirling over. O_o
*nickstr np: Everclear - AM Radio [03:46m/852kbps/44kHz]
<Pattyrick> I like most Sony products (unlike drf :P) but I don't like the newer Viaos
<nickstr> I think getting this setup is a cause for celebration
<Ascendant> Quanyails, did you scroll up? :p
<nickstr> Everclear's AM Radio
<nickstr> in AM stereo
<Ascendant> I PM'd Articuno and she liked the ideas
<Quanyails> 7Oh.
<Quanyails> 7I didn't, NS, but yay!
<Pattyrick> There is 1 AM radio channel here in Teverola xD
<Quanyails> 7Did she state anything specifically?
<Ascendant> She said she probably wouldn't be able to code the bird creator
<Pattyrick> D=
<Ascendant> I'm going to try but I can't guarantee anything because it's quite a difficult app
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<nickstr> we actually do have some AM stations that operate in stereo in the midwestern US
<NewDCD> 9EAT BULLETS
<NewDCD> 9SHOOT THEM THROUGH YOUR ARM
<nickstr> a couple I can get at night are WLS 890 Chicago and KCJJ 1630 Iowa City
<Winter-puff> i thought they were medals
<NewDCD> 9OH SHIT SON
<Quanyails> 7You've mentioned finding a template online.
<NewDCD> 9YOU COUNT THE MEDALS ONE TWO AND THREE
<Ascendant> I did?
<Dman> WAT TE FAK
<Link> I HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE JB
<Link> x_x
<Dman> you can eat bullets and fire them through arms?
<Quanyails> 7Or a template of some sort. o.O
<Ascendant> Well, I'm going to do it in javascript
<Link> then again, who doesnt hate him
<Caaz> Who does-
<Ascendant> Or if that fails, VB or java
<Caaz> WELL.
<Quanyails> 7Flash?
<Ascendant> oh god flash
<Dman> credits are up soon i shall see. seriously wtf is this
<Ascendant> ._________________.
<Quanyails> 7No? :P
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Ascendant> I could try that /if/ I can't do the others
<Pattyrick> My dad used to listen to 710 KIRO back in Washington
<Link> oh god, Caaz dont tell me you LIKE his music .-.
<Quanyails> 7Well, thank you. :)
<Caaz> Of course not lol.
<Quanyails> 7Though we actually need bits and pieces of birds to customize. :P
<nickstr> ugh KIRO
<Link> good :3
<nickstr> another infamous blah blah blah talk station
<Pattyrick> Mmmhmmmm
<nickstr> my favorite up there was KYCW 1090
<Ascendant> I'm more concerned about the coding for the time being
<Ascendant> the images can't be that hard
<nickstr> Classic Country 1090
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<Caaz> His voice annoys me, most high pitched voices do.
<Ascendant> I'll most like just cut out outlines
<Pattyrick> IDK why he liked 710 KIRO
<nickstr> Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo with Orban processing
<nickstr> not to mention MUSIC!
<Pattyrick> I do like KIRO 7 news, though
<NewDCD> 9ladies and gentlemen...chances of clothes ripping: high as fuck
<NewDCD> 9luckily, it didn't happen
<Pattyrick> They did a good job, TV news >>>>>>>>>>>>>> radio news
<Dman> oh lol
<nickstr> even where I was I got good reception of them on just a Walkman
<nickstr> it was a Sony SRF-42
<nickstr> look THAT one up
<Pattyrick> Ok
<nickstr> its a very unique
<nickstr> little receiver
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<Pattyrick> Interesting
<nickstr> I was able to get several AM stations in stereo back around 2001 and 2002
<nickstr> KGHO 920, KLOG 1490, KYCW 1090, KKSN 1520, and KPBC 1640
<Quanyails> 7NS, late, but, you can get transparency in Javascript, right? o.O
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<nickstr> all during the day
<Quanyails> 7Well, actuallly...
<Pattyrick> Haha, KLOG
<Quanyails> 7In those sorts of tools, you have some sort of already-designed base which you just edit parts.
<nickstr> that is a real one
<nickstr> its in Longview WA
<Pattyrick> Hi Obsi
<nickstr> their logo even said this for a while
<Quanyails> 7I'm pretty sure Rora or another artist can design his or her own art for that.
<nickstr> "KLOG 1490 AM STEREO"
<nickstr> it was a green ball with headphones on it
<Pattyrick> xD
<nickstr> they sounded AMAZING in those days!
<Pattyrick> *wonders if he could've gotten KLOG from Kitsap County*
<Pattyrick> Did you live in WA before?
<nickstr> yep
<nickstr> Toledo WA
<nickstr> you would not have heard KLOG from Kitsap County
<nickstr> it was in Cowlitz County
<Dman> i'm about to press play
<Dman> g2 get headphones, don't know what de fuk's gonna come out of the stream
<Pattyrick> Too many Toledos
<Pattyrick> Toledo, Iowa
<nickstr> the reason why I heard them is because I was in southern Lewis County
<Pattyrick> Toledo, Ohio
<Pattyrick> Toledo, Spain
<nickstr> Toledo Oregon
<Pattyrick> AND Toledo, Washington
<nickstr> yep
<Pattyrick> Oh, ok
<Pattyrick> Random question: What would you do for a Klondike Bar, everybody?
<nickstr> you would have been able to hear KGHO 920 and KYCW 1090 in Kitsap County
<nickstr> KGHO was oldies back then
<Dragoran> It's like he sings in the bathroom.
<Pattyrick> Hmm
<Pattyrick> My mom liked 95.7 KJR FM
<nickstr> that is a nice one
<Ascendant> <Quanyails> NS, late, but, you can get transparency in Javascript, right? o.O
<Bjornfot> This page is in Spanish. Would you like to translate it?
<Ascendant> probably
<nickstr> can't go wrong with classic rock much of the time
<Ascendant> else I can do some CSS code for it
<Dman> wat?
<Pattyrick> Apparently it was Seattle's only oldies FM station after 97.3 changed to news
<nickstr> yea
<Dman> and aniway NewDCD and I speak spanish =D
<Ascendant> though IE absolutely craps bricks at alpha
<nickstr> I HATED that
<Pattyrick> Yeah
<nickstr> 97.3 switching to talk
<Ascendant> -moz-opacity works fine, alpha/opacity for IE does not
<Pattyrick> News Talk 97.3 = The talk you don't want to hear from 710, only clearer
<nickstr> KYCW 1090 switching to talk royally ticked me off
<Pattyrick> Hi Luna
<nickstr> same with KGHO 920
<Pattyrick> I much prefer good music to talk
<Quanyails> 7If there are alternate ways of doing that, that'd help. :P
<nickstr> KGHO was proud of what they did
<nickstr> I remember their top of the hour ID to this day
<NewDCD> sorry guys
<NewDCD> apparently
<NewDCD> the internet company hasn't been charging the bill like they should
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- <drfsupercenter> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ANDROID <drfsupercenter> LOL <drfsupercenter> Good for you, you know how to abuse scripts
<NewDCD> since we had a direct discount plan
<nickstr> "Our call letters are KGHO, our city of license is Olympia, our dial position 920 AM stereo, our specialty good time hit oldies
<NewDCD> so they cut off my internet for a sec and sent me a notice
<NewDCD> now they are allowing me to browse again
<Quanyails> 7Well, NS, you can, I suppose start the sketch of the program.
<NewDCD> but I still got to fix this problem
<nickstr> as you can tell I listened to them quite a bit
<Pattyrick> LOL xD
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Jenemmy> R
<Jenemmy> D
<nickstr> even had some recordings of them off of the Sony SRF-42 in stereo
<Jenemmy> What game is this?
<NewDCD> 9let's continue our descent into madness, then
<NewDCD> 9Jenemmy: you don't want to know
<Jenemmy> Yes I do.
<Pattyrick> I wish I could listen to a little bit of American radio
<Jenemmy> Is it hentai or frightening?
<nickstr> most people think AM just has crappy telephone quality mono
<nickstr> but I have heard it with HIFI stereo sound
<Pattyrick> I like the Italian radio here, but it's different
<NewDCD> 9it's a spinoff of Queen's Blade that also has fighting game characters like Dizzy and Noel Vermillion and Ivy Valentine in it
<Pattyrick> Depends on how good your signal is
<NewDCD> 9that should tell you everything you need
<Jenemmy> Seems boring.
<nickstr> true
<Pattyrick> FM could sound bad too in an area with poor reception
<NewDCD> 9I love SRPGs
<nickstr> exactly
<Pattyrick> Like Seabeck :P
<nickstr> or White Pass
<Pattyrick> AKA where I was
<nickstr> you should have tried it
<nickstr> listening to FM while going over White Pass
<nickstr> it was craptastic
<Pattyrick> Or the area before you reach Leavenworth
<Pattyrick> No radio at all
<nickstr> except on AM
<Bjornfot> This game goes incredibly well with our RPing...
<Ascendant> well there probably are, Quanyails
<nickstr> AM will usually work where FM is spotty
<Pattyrick> I think there were about 3 AM stations, and only 1 was coherant
<Ascendant> also, any suggestions for mods on PO? @ Quan
<nickstr> especially at night
<Ascendant> just going to ask whether anyone wants to mod it
<nickstr> because ionosphere FTW!
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Ascendant> which doesn't mean i'm going to actually mod them though lol
<nickstr> actually shortwave works there too
<nickstr> on White Pass
<Ascendant> Glacymr is already and an admin and I'll probably make Xeli a mod
<Ascendant> Seeing as I know he's used PO with me before
<nickstr> I remember listening to the BBC up there
<Pattyrick> They have BBC radio in WA?
<Dman> ok i playe'd and am now here! : D
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> just over shortwave
<Pattyrick> Oh
<nickstr> I was hearing it from a site in Assencian Island
<Pattyrick> What's shortwave?
<nickstr> in the Atlantic
<NewDCD> 9you're one hell of a masochist bro
<nickstr> basically bands between 3 and 30 MHz
<Dman> Is THIS the mindrape game?
<Dman> doesn't seem like it so far
<NewDCD> 9you haven't seen nothing yet
<Pattyrick> Ok
<nickstr> there are broadcast bands in this range where stations can cover entire continents with ease
<Dman> lul
<Pattyrick> Wow
<Quanyails> 7I don't know how PO exactly works, so I'll leave that to whoever does. :P
<RDash> Call PETA
<Quanyails> 7@ NS/
<Dman> Call RSPCA
<Pattyrick> So you got BBC?
<nickstr> I used to hear NHK's external broadcasts direct from Japan over shortwave
<Pattyrick> That's amazing
<nickstr> I can even here
<NewDCD> 9fuck your shit bro
<NewDCD> 9JAPANESE MARMADUKE MUST DIE
<Pattyrick> Dang

<nickstr> 11,000 miles from Assencion Island and 12,000 from St. Helena Island
<Ascendant> I haven't set the server up yet since I ran out of time last night
<NewDCD> 9why do you think everyone else went OH GOD WHAT
<Pattyrick> That's lo ger than the US from west to east, rightt?

<Pattyrick> 0__o
<NewDCD> 9I should know
<nickstr> yes
<Pattyrick> *longer
<Dman> hah hah hah
<nickstr> shortwave is something
<nickstr> even in this day and age a twist of the dial can take you around the world
<Pattyrick> That'd be a neat feature to have in a car radio
<NewDCD> 9AWW SHIT
<nickstr> some do
<Dman> CRUSH!
<NewDCD> 9there you go
<Dman> WTF
<Dman> ok i got that much

<Pattyrick> I could see if it was possible for me to get 95.7 xD
<Dman> hah hahahaha
<Ascendant> But I'll set it up tonight hopefully
<nickstr> it would not be
<Pattyrick> Nope
<nickstr> they are not on shortwave

<NewDCD> 9so Dman
<NewDCD> 9what did you think it was?
<Dman> um
<Dman> i figured it was psp cuz it's what you normally do
<Dman> but
<Dman> it looked to be some obscure 3rd party pc japanonly game
*May sighs
<NewDCD> 9hah
<Quanyails> 7Haaaaaaaaaai, May.
<Dman> especially considering what was happening lol
<Quanyails> 7*late*
<NewDCD> 9Queen's Whatever is not very obscure
<Kosoveon> i think just saying "hi" to a newbie joining this channel or on the forum on a regular basis is way to motivate them to stay
<May> 14I've been on/off Quan
<Dman> yea i've actually heard of that
<Kosoveon> and heya jet
<NewDCD> 9this game actually came out really recently
<May> 14it's no problem
<JetTheLatios> Hey Kosovo
<JetTheLatios> Good the see you back
<JetTheLatios> :D
<Dman> : 0
<NewDCD> 9also fun fact: those animations were shit compared to SRW
*Glacymr rawrs at Kosoveon
<Nick> hey Jet :)
<Quanyails> 7That's all right; is it life that's interrupting you? :P
<Quanyails> 7NICK. o3o
<May> 14Just saying 'hi'?
<Kosoveon> thanks jet
<Quanyails> 7Heya. :P
<JetTheLatios> Hey nick
<NewDCD> 9I should stream SRW again...even if people lost interest that one time I was streaming it
<JetTheLatios> o:
*Quanyails 7pokes Nick with that fic.
<Kosoveon> as in, when they log in, say "hi -so and so-"
<May> 14Nah, it's my internet
<May> 14keep disconnecting
<May> 14and going down
<Kosoveon> and doing it consistently
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<May> 14I would think... Perhaps "Hi, so and so! How are you?"
*Kosoveon rawrs back at Glacymr weakly
<May> 14that would seem better to me
<JetTheLatios> Kosovo
<Kosoveon> also hi !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 16 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
<JetTheLatios> You seem different
<JetTheLatios> owo
<Kosoveon> you think so o-o
*JetTheLatios nods.
*Nick pokes Quanyails with a purifying silverwing
<Kosoveon> well that's kind of what I meant, May
<Dman> dayum chrome crashed : /
<Kosoveon> I guess I worded it incorrectly
*Quanyails 7blinks.

<Polarfire> firefox.
<Polarfire> :3
<Dman> I know i know

<May> 14I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sounds like a jerk
<Apokalipse> I prefer chrome actually
<May> 14I lack common sense so it takes me longer to process things
<Dman> why wub chwome and fwiwefwox users

<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.ehow.com/list_7261336_side-effects-using-dove-antiperspirant.html?utm_source=outbrain&utm_medium=test11 < LOL
<Kosoveon> no no it's okay

<Dman> Lol dat jump
<Apokalipse> I don't notice anything dman
<Dashite> Dat lack of swan dive.
<NewDCD> 9that's actually the game's ambience
<Kosoveon> I just made it sound like the only thing to do to make people say is merely say "hi" and that should be enough
<Kosoveon> engaging in conversation with them is much more effective
<Apokalipse> ooooh scary music
<Kosoveon> obviously XD
<Apokalipse> kind of
<May> 14Hmm

<Dman> polarfire - what will we do with this text?
<Dman> YORU VOICE :3 !!
<RobotPinkie> So the moving pillar should be on the other side
*Polarfire grabs some popcorn and offers it to Dman.

<Dman> I was just saying how the microsoft livestream delayed rpeated the sound in tomb raider demo. remember it?
<Dman> sounded like an orgasm lul
<Dman> :3 NewDCD hi five!
<RobotPinkie> Yay!

<Dman> yfw haven't played either much
<Dman> played first 2 hours of sands of time
<prince-dari> I love Prince of Persia.
<Dman> and played bits of tombraider ps1
<Dashite> Oh yeah, PoP 2008 was awesome amirite?
<prince-dari> They were all good.
<RobotPinkie> lol, I love Prince of Persia series too XD
<prince-dari> Warrior Within is probably my favourite though.
<Dman> the emo one?
<Dman> :P
<Dashite> Wut? Warrior Within?
<Dashite> Really?
<Dashite> The worst game in the series?
<prince-dari> I loved that one.
<Dman> hahaha
<Dman> fanboys arguing is cute :3
<prince-dari> It was easily the best.
<Bjornfot> Prince of Persia? Moar liek, Prince of Repetitiveness.
<Polarfire> lol
<RobotPinkie> Got the "less than 20 rewinds" trophy in Sands of Time :P
<prince-dari> More graphic, darker, more interesting. :P
<drf-Droid> Quany I might have a job for you involving small images
<Dashite> And a billion times more emo
<Dman> NewDCD - it could be said that this map has leverage over you
<Apokalipse> I like the first PoP game...
<Dman> lol
<Dman> mean kick was mean 8 <
<Quanyails> 7Actual pixel art or small digital art? :P
<AlCapony> Did somebody say...
<AlCapony> LEVERAGE?
<drf-Droid> basically
<Dman> So Prince-dari halp i still have sands of time installed but it's getting a little boring : /
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's right, you have to jump to the pillars on the side and take the hard way 'round :(
<drf-Droid> typing stuff in a small amount of pixels
<drf-Droid> so that it's readable
<Pegacorn> LEVERAGE
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Dman> LOOK FACE NOW, LEVERAGE, DO THIS...sir.
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya DRF
<Dman> oh the many memes of bronystate :P
<drf-Droid> if I can convert bitmaps to calculator images, at last.
<drf-Droid> *least
<Pegacorn> Dy-no-mite.
<Dman> jaws - a whaaaaat
<Dman> yes, DY NO MITE
<Dman> all will be in Trivia : D
<Apokalipse> Huh, I only know ...sir Damn me for mising out on 2 weeks
<Dman> : /
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Dman> well, we saw 'black dynamite' a film i highly recommend you watch
<Dman> :P
<Quanyails> 7Well, there are pixel fonts.
<Dman> and LOOK FACE NOW was from newdcd's first play of snatcher
<Dman> we had an option to look face
<Dman> so yea hahaha
<Dashite> On the bright side you didn't have to sit through the first 80% of Battlefield Earth.
<Bjornfot> prince-dari be prince-mad
<Dashite> eggonface.jpg
<RobotPinkie> One of the greatest movies of all time.
<Quanyails> 7I find Minifont extremely minuscule, though some characters look odd at first glance.
<Umbreon> 12Dragoran sworeD:
<drf-Droid> basically
<RobotPinkie> Sorry, I'mma let you finish
<Dman> Dashite is right there
<prince-dari> Bjornfot has no taste in games.
<drf-Droid> I want to store large amounts of formulas as images on my graphing calculator
*drf-Droid hides
<Dashite> Says the guy who like Warrior Within
<Dman> Fave game ever guys?
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<Quanyails> 7I see...
<Dashite> Command and Conquer Red Alert
<prince-dari> Warrior Within is so awesome.
<Pegacorn> Bjornfo has no taste PERIOD.
<Quanyails> 7Well, I can give you minifont.
<Pegacorn> *Bjornfot
<Quanyails> 7Some letters look slightly strange, like S, but most are readable.
<Dman> I know that feel, NewDCD bro
<prince-dari> Your reason for disliking it is that it's "emo"? Lawl.
<Dashite> Dari also likes Spider's Web
<Quanyails> 7The largest characters are five-pixels tall and wide.
<Dman> What flavour Doritos?
<Quanyails> 7Well, five pixels tall or wide.
<Dman> The what?
<prince-dari> Spider's Web is good because it's so random.
<Dman> humble ini brundo?
<drf-Droid> can it do math symbols?
<Dman> oh yea i like them
<drf-Droid> like integrals, sigma, etc
<Quanyails> 7Well, never tried it out, but I can try.
<Dashite> Boo-ritos. :D
<Astray> BEAMS?
<Dman> but what did you say? the humble indie bundle? OH steam
<Astray> LIKE BEAM SABERS?
<Dman> yes i now abot that
<Dman> no it's fine
<Astray> PEW PEW?
<Dman> my volume's low, bro
<RobotPinkie> I wasn't a big fan of the game ending bugs in the GC version of Warrior Within, but it's probably my favorite as far as gameplay goes.
<Dman> I didn't : / sorry
<RobotPinkie> Might need to take the pillar to the left instead.
<Dashite> I already own all the games in that bundle that I have any interest in.
<prince-dari> Warrior Within was the most adult of all the PoP games.
<prince-dari> I love it.
<Dman> i can agree with taht, but i've only seen trailers and gameplay. but yea
<Quanyails> 7What formulae do you need? :P
<Dashite> And adult automatically means it's good.
<Dman> Yes, bundle was amazing for money
<prince-dari> Well I didn't say that.
<RobotPinkie> I liked the arabian nights style storytelling of the first, though, I was disappointed at that going away in Warrior Within. :(
<Sneas> 03KCUF YEAH
<Quanyails> 7(Note that I only have the remainder of today and early tomorrow before I leave for Baltimore.)
<Dman> $1 lol
*Sneas runz

<Dman> ok ok
<Skylands> 10!sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 30 minutes
<drf-Droid> um
<Apokalipse> I still like the first PoP game the most. Evil person puts you in dungeon. Escape in an hour.

<RobotPinkie> Oooh, I know favorite game of all time. Landstalker.
<Pegacorn> Ohai SilverMane
<Quanyails> 7'Stuff' is rather vague. Especially for a topic I'm only familiar with at a very general level.
<SilverMane> damn, didn't even get 5 seconds unnoticed.
<Quanyails> 7Could you give me the equations and notes? :P
<SilverMane> and Tomb Raider? which one?
<drf-Droid> well

<Pegacorn> SilverMane,you wouldn't like what's going on in the ponyRP channel
<Dashite> Too bad it wasn't Pinkie that spotted Silverman first.

<Dashite> VVVVVV ain't got nothing on AaAaaAAAa
<drf-Droid> I need to see if I can even turn bitmaps into a format my calculator understands.
<drf-Droid> if I can't, no point
<Dman> but if i can pay $1 for 5 games why shouldn't I just download it for free? I mean, any multiplayer games?
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<SilverMane> you pay the money to support them
<Dman> i guess so : P
<Apokalipse> Dman you greedy bastard :p
<Dashite> Excuse me, I meant to say "AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!"
<drf-Droid> I'll check when I get home
<SilverMane> i hear the average paid price is around 23 dollars for optional-price game
<Dman> giving $1 probably but i'm deciding now how much to give
<Dman> if even want
<Sneas> 03h

*Polarfire takes a minute to draw his OC
<Dman> >HUWEEEEEEEEEEE

<Pegacorn> lol
<Dman> oh man NewDCD your livestreams are the best! :P
<RobotPinkie> Might need to shoot down the hanging thing :P
<Dashite> Debit is directly linked to your bank account.
*Sally hugs Kitten
<Dashite> Credit is not.
<Dman> i say 'meem
<prince-dari> ^
<Bjornfot> meem

<Dman> apparently doctors recommend it
<SilverMane> i like my debit card, i never have to pay interest!
<Apokalipse> hahaha
<Dashite> I haven't paid interest on my credit card either.
<Dman> HAHA 'crayon physics deluxe playing with crayons has never been so physical' 'i got quite physical with my crayon last night' hahaha
<SilverMane> Luna got pregnant by Rainbow Dash, and no rule 63 was involved!
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Wut
<RobotPinkie> Memetics was suggested by... I don't remember who... Richard Dawkins and someone else.
<Dman> genes are fun
<SilverMane> that's what i said, prince-dari
<Dashite> First Rainbow Dash gives everyone puberty, now this?
<Dman> silvermane....
<SilverMane> yes?
<Dman> i'm still doing pre med student stuff, but I look up to you NewDCD, that's what i wanna be doing in a few years
<RobotPinkie> But yeah, bring up the guns before using the grapple
<Dman> well i dunno what i know and what u know
<SilverMane> lol
<Dman> do you know about glycolysis? that's a sorta indetail chunk of the course I'm doing
<RobotPinkie> I think.... it's been a while :P
<Dman> and ATP production
<Dman> with 3 major steps?
<Apokalipse> Ooh I had to learn about ATP production this year
<Apokalipse> I remember nothing at all
<Dman> glycolysis, krebs cycle, electron chain : P
<RobotPinkie> Think you need to shoot down the hanging decoration, which also does something very good for you below
<Dman> HAHAHA
<SilverMane> Do you know about PMLE?
<Dman> acetyl coenzyme a and stuff
<Dman> yea wtf it's not gonna be used!
<RobotPinkie> I know nothing of medical science...
<Dman> acetyl coa is part of krebs cycle and stuff
<Dman> yea filter shiz
<Dman> and then there's the other spectrum...
<SilverMane> i'm CPR, AED, and First Aid certified. for some reason
<Dman> learning about life evolving over years in areas
<RobotPinkie> And now you have TWO annoying pillars you need to move...
<Dman> such as' DERP plants then smallinsects the nanimals'
<Dman> ORLY?
<Dashite> I used to have CPR and First Aid cert. It's been a long time though.
<Dman> 3 atp 1 nadh
<Dman> from 3chain glucose
<prince-dari> MFW biology. CBA - too broad.
<Dashite> I don't think I remember much of anything about them though.
<Dman> so from a glucose that is split into 2 thats 6 atp and 1 nadh, cuz glucose has 6 C
<Dman> prince-dari i know
<Dman> 1/4 of biology in UK is med
<Dman> but most chem is med so i did that too :P
<Dman> then there's GEENZ
<SilverMane> have you learned about PMLE?
<RobotPinkie> Second corridor is even more annoying, yay!
<Dman> ECKS CHROMOZOUM WHY CHROMOZOUM
<Dman> darp
<Dman> yea they really should
<prince-dari> I've been told you don't actually need biology A level to do medicine at university (though I'd imagine it'd make it easier)
<prince-dari> That you can do it just with chemistry.
<Dman> newDCD yfw i have magnets of 2 of every chromosome on mah fridge. also prince-dari yfw this was free from BBC on a website
<Dman> Prince-dari no u don't
<Dman> : P
<Dman> A level - UK newdcd
<Dman> like uh
<Dman> 44
<Dman> cuz 42 but got X 4 times
<Dman> incase of male ; )
<prince-dari> Why did they update O levels, then not update A levels to go with it.
<Dman> oh a magnet is a chromatid
<prince-dari> So now A levels don't even make sense.
<prince-dari> You've got GCSEs, then advanced level. Wut
<Dman> Yes actually :P
<SilverMane> this conversation is exhausting to read
<Dman> LOOK u want me to find a pic of them?

*prince-dari jumps out of his window.
<prince-dari> MFW window is on the ground floor
<ClockworkPie> lol
<SoiPony> lol
<ClockworkPie> dari i think you have gone crazy from lack of sleep
<prince-dari> I can't hear you over the sound of red rum.
<SoiPony> lol
<ClockworkPie> here we go again :/
<prince-dari> I think I could make the jump from my sister's room on the 1st floor to our garden.
<SoiPony> I think he's challenging authority
<SoiPony> lol
<prince-dari> I'll try it later than film the results.
<ClockworkPie> so how much brain damage would you get from that?
<prince-dari> None, I might break an ankle/leg though.
<prince-dari> Unlikely.
<prince-dari> Landing on grass it should be fine.
<prince-dari> It can't be more than about 3-4 meters.
<ClockworkPie> Sooooooo...........why are you gonna do this?
<prince-dari> Because I can.
<prince-dari> Duh.
<SoiPony> to impress the mares
<ClockworkPie> Ah.........thats cool
<SoiPony> scootaloo has to crush on someone anyway
<SoiPony> :S
<ClockworkPie> :3
<prince-dari> If I make the jump fine I want to try a front flip out of the window. Maybe I'll practice a while before I try that though.
<SoiPony> lol
<ClockworkPie> Go for it
<ClockworkPie> go for broke and do a back flip instead
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Lawl, I'm not crazy.
<ClockworkPie> Clearly >.>
<prince-dari> I'd need to get my technique really good before I try that.
<SoiPony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/53.jpg
<SoiPony> Dari at the moment
<ClockworkPie> i wouldnt try jumping out of my window because i would have to clear the rocks belo it
<prince-dari> WHO NEEDS SLEEP ANYWAY?!
<prince-dari> There's grass nearly directly below the window at my house.
<prince-dari> You'd have to be amazingly stupid to manage to miss it.
<SoiPony> lol
<ClockworkPie> i would probably miss it
<ClockworkPie> im just unlucky like that
<prince-dari> The gravel is directly below the window, about 40 cm of it.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> To land on it would be...
<prince-dari> Very impressive.
<ClockworkPie> it would happen, i would easily hit the rocks
<SoiPony> my eyes hurt
<SoiPony> NO FUCKINHG WAY
<ClockworkPie> lolwut?
<SoiPony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/3.png
<ClockworkPie> my eyes just derped

<RainBroDash> it's like 600% louder
<RainBroDash> WAT

<prince-dari> MFW I realise the alarm I set for when I was getting up just went off.
<RainBroDash> XD
<lighty> Are you a op there?
<RainBroDash> mfw i turned up winter wrap up so it drowns out metallica on the tv
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<lighty> Ascendant, if youre an op there, and he isnt
<Ascendant> That was in PM
<prince-dari> I was singing this because everyone was gone, then suddenly someone who's been idle for hours pops up. XD
<lighty> PROFIT
<Ascendant> and I'm not an IRC op on that network
<Ascendant> ...yet
<RainBroDash> oh deaar dari
<Ascendant> and banning him would be power abuse as well lol
<prince-dari> I already sang it for them once at some other point.
<lighty> :P
<RainBroDash> there's only dashite at the moment :P
<prince-dari> It was MidnightStar.
<lighty> Good, turn to the dark side of power abuse!
<prince-dari> Dashite's just AFK.
<lighty> Erm, being op
<lighty> :P
<RainBroDash> orly
<prince-dari> They blackmailed me with "I'm not eating until you sing this for us".
<prince-dari> So I ended up singing it for them.
<RainBroDash> rofl
<Ascendant> Oh trust me, I've banned a total of 5 people from my network
<RainBroDash> wonderful
<prince-dari> MFW it loops
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<Ascendant> or maybe 1-2 more
<RainBroDash> epic.
<NightSeas> 12Just say it was a ping time out ban if that makes any since ;p
<Ascendant> 2 were idiots
<RainBroDash> i can't sing for shit
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> excuses are lame
<prince-dari> Well nor can I.
<RainBroDash> fair
<prince-dari> You might find out next time they organise a hunger strike. :P
<lighty> Ascendant doesnt need excuses
<RainBroDash> i would lol so hard if you were someone I'd known before, and we eventually found out
<prince-dari> I suppose this pretty much concludes BMN Caffeine Edition No. 4.
<Ascendant> I'm just that awesome :p
<NightSeas> 12XD
<lighty> She just kicks ass and doesnt give a sh*t
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> That'd be brilliant.
<RainBroDash> it's not -as- unlikely as someone like dman, since you live in reading. I know enough people from reading who've gone to my various schools over the years
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> blah setting up a PO server with such a crap connection isn't going to work
<RainBroDash> I doubt we're further than 2 degrees of seperation away from each other on facebook
<Ascendant> my internet is being dialup again
<prince-dari> Haha, quite possibly. XD
<Espeon> 06k
<lighty> If that is it to be a op, i want to be one too someday, hell, i own 3 sites and 3 forums :P
<prince-dari> Hm.
<prince-dari> It only loops once.
<prince-dari> That's weird.
<RainBroDash> O.o
