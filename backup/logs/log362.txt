<Tovler> Meanwhile: Bud Light Platinum. For water, it's quite clean
<grayhoof> The scene where Hillary and Nick go into the Swedish bookstore was staged, shot and then run backwards to make the dialog sound "unique." If you record the scene and play it backwards, you will find all of the dialogue to be exactly what is shown in the subtitles except for the title of the book Hillary asks for. The title she actually asks for is "Europe On 5 Quaaludes A Day."
<LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL> rofl
<Monkey_Zombie> speaking backwards

<Silver_Rush> WWWHHHAAATTTTT
<KaeBrony> Tarzen?
<Davie_Jones> 1)Ponies don't know war.
<Davie_Jones> Starting with the obvious, nobody wears armor who doesn't know about war. You don't make armies, or armor, or castle walls to deal with the occasional random wild animal or civil disruption. Hunters deal with animals (or monsters.) Police deal with crimes and disorderly crowds. Soldiers deal with soldiers.
<Davie_Jones> I can see it being feasible that a country could experience a long, long period without open warfare. But not to the point that they are alien to the concept. And history shows that nations that begin to sneer at arms and armor and armies as "barbaric" or "unnecessary" find themselves at war--- or enslaved---- a very very short time afterwards. They shall beat their plowshares into
<Davie_Jones> swords, and slave in the fields for those that didn't.
<Nintyuk> waaat
<RanYakumo> and thus, their romance was ruined.[

<nekohime1138> wtf
<Jaketehsnake> so much 4th wall
<pwny> So, question: Does the sun make an audible ticking noise? Is it audible to everypony, or just people within sight of Canterlot? Is it psychically projected into everypony's brain? Is it so loud everypony goes temporarially deaf?
<Stoneward> dinky was there...
<ScootaChicken> Tovler: I remember when it used to be, those were fun times.
<RAINBOWCRASH> sorry i was bored
<RainbowDash48> OMG DIZY DOO!

<Kencolt> Actually, they just hold you back a grade, make you repeat it...
<ScootaChicken> I could write in colour and everything
<vaarsuvius> 6_9
<DerpyHooves000> lol
<wikkiwikkiwa> I hope they do an episode explaining the origins of Alicorns
<troll> derpy is my mom
<SteveCharb> seriously Celestia WOULD do that
<StinkomanFan> This is all in Spike's mind.
<K_A> To an alicorn, all other ponies are kindergardners.

<otakon> Meanwhile: you ARE a bit arrogant at times
<Mixitupboo> thanks for stating the obvious!
<MosaicKnight> Oh shit son, she means it.
<Mullberry_Metal> BEITYCH
<nekohime1138> because nothing is worse than a friend going to kindergarten
<Meanwhile> Stubborn, perhaps, and I have no sense of tact. And buck the police.
<maxderp> trollestia: make a big deal when the student whos saved ur asss twice is a little late on 1 letter.
<Darf14> needs more focus
<NEPTUNE> :(
<SteveCharb> I think Celestia really would have sent Twilight back to Kindergarten. She totally would.
<tgl1992> Aw I wanna give spike a hug
<Mudora> dat ad?
<pony_3039> her mane is like ice cream :P
<Loopty> spike is peepin
<EspyLacopa> This isn't angry Celestia, this is Disappointed Celestia.
<TopHat> Meanwhile: can you act like an arrogant douche?
<RainbowDash48> dat chest
<pwny> "I'm a bad student! I deserve to be punished!"
<Kipkat07> tardy
<great-powerfull> embrace yourselfs
<Ingwaz> i do enjoy rarity's playfulness

<rockcambo> Celestia: You are a wonderful student... ON THE MOON
<richfiles> ORLY Celestia, is best Celestia. <3
<Red_Pegasus> Agent Dash!
<Linkhopper> Eyup
<Tovler> I'm oddly douchey about not being a douche
<By-tor> attack!
<otakon> that's just him being british
<Randomnerd> We're pretty tactless, as a whole :-/

<nekopon> Dat lag
<great-powerfull> pinkie best cry
<ScootaChicken> emangamer is quite tactless
<TOY_PON3> Molesting?
<NEPTUNE> EYEBROW RAISE
<Randomnerd> No social cues exist on the internet.
<StinkomanFan> But as all of these traits were added as a conglomeration of the fans and the writers Big Mac comes off less as an omnipetent super being and more of a humble guy with nothing more in life than to do his job
<DocSane> This is Celestia upset with herself for not giving Twilight any damned affection for a year.

<TOY_PON3> ^
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol

<Randomnerd> Luna on the moon: Celestia banishing people to the moon because she's jealous of power, or just a lesson about how sometimes people in power do things out of fear.
<Davie_Jones> Not really, Scoota
<Cypresswolf> Party Cannon'd
<Evil_Spike> That was awesome
<Tovler> The community in general isn't that bad (that's me talking to myself)
<pwny> I'm with DocSane

<StinkomanFan> Then comes Luna, before the Nightmare Night episode we saw her as scared of the world before her
<Stoneward> poor clown...
<ScootaChicken> the 'TOO THE MOOONAAAAAAAH BEEYETCH' video, whilst lowbrow, is good for a cheap laugh
<Meanwhile> Anything not by the original creators is wrong technically.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no, I mean morally wrong
<StinkomanFan> how much things had changed
<TOY_PON3> I have come to terms with myself when I say I like the fandom
<Kipkat07> derpypie: lol

<Dynamic_Brony> If I was the clown I would hide and then say I did the Hour show
<Cypresswolf> O_O....but...he was driving around the tower in a circle...
<Evil_Spike> Singing?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<Davie_Jones> Nightmare Night was good proof of why writers SHOULD NOT always listen to the fans.
<tisaname> -_-
<Meanwhile> I have one moral.

<MistarFish> team clown blasting off again!
<StinkomanFan> Luna represents our fear of being rejected by society for who we are
<Davie_Jones> Nothing the fanon could make would be a good as that.
<Darf14> He has been banished.....TO THE MOOOONNNAAAAHHHH!
<Randomnerd> They ignored fanon Luna.
<Tovler> it's still weird to me that that this whole phenomenon spawned because a cartoon that merely did a good job despite it's My Little Pony reputation.
<pony117> MOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAHHHHHHH BEY-TCH!!!
<otakon> then I agree completely Davie_Jones Luna was great
<goldRDpony> its time for you to go away clown gogogogo to the moon

<Davie_Jones> Rather than making her afraid of the world, they expanded on the fact that she was trapped on teh moon for 1000 years and was used to old customs.

<Sumica> 00,10wikkiwikkiwa same production studio
<Stormpony> OMG.. Calculon!
<Kipkat07> PINKEH & TE BRAYN
<otakon> TOY_PON3: well the content of the blog is a little racy, EXACTLY^^
<pwny> Pinkie and the brain
<Randomnerd> My friend and I came to this conclusion... as delightful as it is to see nods to the Bronies, Studio B shouldn't go out of its way to amuse us.
<Evil_Spike> TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
<Fin> so true
<[ger]Brony> Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle
<DerpyPie> MmmHmm
<DocSane> thx-1138
<Dynamic_Brony> The pinkie and the brain
<StinkomanFan> And then the Cakes, suprisingly there relationship has remained untouched by the fandom
<SteveCharb> you guys weren't kidding about Shed.mov, it sucked, it was Happy Tree Friends minus the originality and humor
<pwny> Pinkie Pie never dies, she just changes form
<pony_pi> the :O and the:)
<GrimCookies> pinkie, pinky and the brain
<otakon> although it is fairly funny
<Dismo> Oh my god, Who's streaming?
<pwny> right now, she's Pinky
<Randomnerd> The show is great because it wasn't ashamed to be silly.
<Dynamic_Brony> brain brain brain
<Tovler> I mean, MLP is a good show and all, but this cult follow seems undeserved. *damn honest drunk*
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<RainbowDash48> IKR
<wikkiwikkiwa> I figured as much Sumica
<SteveCharb> oh hey pinky and the brain
<detour> Wait a sec. THATS NOT PINKIE! IMPOSTER

<Fin> to late for that..
<Dynamic_Brony> ha ha ha
<DoctorTimeyWimeySICK> That makes sence Cypresswolf
<otakon> Tovler: well it cant' really be explained, and this isnlt a cult following
<DerpyHooves000> for serious, how do you do the fluttershy rageface
<pwny> Pinky x Pinkie
<DerpyPie> 6_9and the;)(mane)
<DoctorTimeyWimeySICK> sense
<JoachimR> ha
<Stoneward> billy ray cyprus lol
<Stormpony> OMG, it's Tress Macneil!
<Evil_Spike> Dat face
<pwny> SNARF
<Davie_Jones> Right, there are little things that they can nod too. Like Derpy. that was nice. But she needs to stay a minor character.
<pony_pi> ;(
<RainbowDash48> WTF IS THIS
<Fin> ponys already did that.
<DoctorTimeyWimeySICK> or something
<otakon> well I don think so
<Ziltoidian> boob
<PrincessLuna> lol
<tisaname> narf....
<SteveCharb> Are you pondering what I'm pondering?
<TwoTone> lol . . . .boob
<Randomnerd> Davie_Jones: That's right!
<RAINBOWCRASH> shed.mov next
<GrimCookies> not as good as val kilmer :P
<Cypresswolf> OH YES! Billy Ray Cyrus!
<Dark_Horst2> funfact: boob is a bird
<pwny> is this Orson Welles, or an amazing simulation? I forget
<Dynamic_Brony> what they use in ponies
<otakon> Davie_Jones: agreed, but it was just a shou out and I liked it
<Evil_Spike> No
<Kencolt> Ever see the Pinkie and the Brain PMV?
<Randomnerd> That's why I liked Big Mac grabbing Smarty Pants
<TwoTone> simulation
<Valistar> I've totally seen this one. Which is not very many of them!
<Fin> no thay ARE pnoys
<Sumica> 00,10RAINBOWCRASH we dont speak of that here
<Evil_Spike> Best answer ever
<DerpyPie> The derpy and the mane;):P
<robokun> not subliminal enough!
<Fin> ponies*
<Tovler> speaking of unexplainable subliminal stuff
<pony117> Then Miley happened...
<PrincessLuna> do they ever show freakazoid?
<pony_2664> :D
<Darf14> Psychology warfare!
<otakon> like the Big Lebowski ponies
<RainbowDash48> XD
<Stoneward> i could totally dance to that
<TOY_PON3> Derpy will always be a minor character
<otakon> ^^
<pwny> we've gotta watch a Candlejack episode of Freakaz---
<Evil_Spike> WE WILL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY!
<Randomnerd> It was Studio B saying "Hey guys, we know you watch, and we think that's cool"
<Stoneward> ah ha ha ha hu huu
<pony_pi> that's my jam :)
<JoachimR> o RLY?
<DocSane> No, but he did Orson Welles impressions A LOT.
<DerpyHooves000> ^^
<Evil_Spike> Narf
<richfiles> Night
<pony117> I could shuffle to that
<Randomnerd> There are really only 7 major characters.
<otakon> but a well loved minor character
<Cypresswolf> And that's how Equestria was made ^_^
<DocSane> Maurice LaMarche, I think.
<TwoTone> I suggest ashens reviews, not pony but still entertaining.
<TheDr> gtg guys
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<MistarFish> Pinkie hurts my head too
<Randomnerd> The Mane 6 and Spike.
<GrimCookies> Bye TheDr
<SteveCharb> Are you pondering what I'm pondering?
<otakon> eeyup
<Kimori> It wouldnt surprise me if there was a lets play video for every spyro game
<Dynamic_Brony> I have an idea for sending the message
<DerpyHooves000> :B
<Evil_Spike> Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen
<WiiCameAsRomans> damn this show is old!
<DerpyPie> :D
<Fin> pffft
<Red_Pegasus> A TV show inside a TV show?
<TOY_PON3> To be honest, Spike needs more love.
<Tovler> I trace back my becoming-a-brony to when Fluttershy said "And Buzzards that can really buzz"
<pwny> Candlejack Freakazoid next?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Country music is bad
<DerpyPie> What the fuck?

<WiiCameAsRomans> Pinkie reminds me of ellis from l4d2
<gaybrony91> :p
<ncb_LuckyStampede> You can increase your heigh with surgery now
<StinkomanFan> The meddling with the Cakes (Or the Lack therof) represents how we just want to meet someone nice and have a fairly succesful life
<DerpyPie> I wanna know how to increase my hight too :'(
<ncb_LuckyStampede> They break and stretch your bones
<Cypresswolf> My Elementary school PE teachers had that Billy Ray Cyrus tape, played it every time we played a game like North South East West, Clean up your Own Backyard (essentially dodge ball with soft plushie balls) & Pac Man ^_^
<Davie_Jones> meddling?
<Dynamic_Brony> dat pants
<ncb_LuckyStampede> honestly, being tlal is not all that great
<Darf14> Stilts solve all height problems
<RainbowDash48> lol to high!
<Wrek> 05Heroes 6 is fuckign awesome so far :D
<Evil_Spike> Why does Brain not modify his normal suit?
<Randomnerd> True. Very few jokes about their parentage.
<Sharakan> seems legit
<SteveCharb> it's good if you want to be President
<Wrek> 05its no hearoes 3, but it sure is good
<Ziltoidian> dem legs
<DocSane> Yep, that's legit.
<TOY_PON3> Yeah they don't get deep into it
<PinkiePieNarf> Oh yes, I remember this episode.
<pony117> lookin like a fool with yo pants on the ground
<otakon> well it's not surprising
<TwoTone> Why doesn't he wear his robot suit?
<DerpyPie> :O
<SteveCharb> but height is a disadvantage if you want to be an astronaut
<Randomnerd> No one found marital infidelity funny enough to make jokes about.
<Tovler> well, 90% of people with college degrees say married.
<ShinitaiHana> oooh this is THAT episode.. oh my :x
<Darf14> ouch

<[ger]Brony> Not paying?
<TOY_PON3> I do enjoy Pumpkin Cake and Pound Cake though :)
<WiiCameAsRomans> Blood Orgy!
<PinkiePieNarf> You know, the reason I love FIM so much is because it's so cleverly written. Kind of like the show we're watching right now.
<DerpyHooves000> :\

<Stoneward> pain that will linger
<GrimCookies> "Oh btw PULL MY FINGER!"

<Princess_Luna> To anypony interested in the slightest, I was rather rude here a week prior and want to apologize to the administrators. One, for those acts, and two, for taking so long to make an apology. Maybe three for almost considering breaking the rules just to do it. If anypony here saw, it was horrible, I feel horrible still, and will because it was out of line...even for me...
<MahBoi777> lol
<DocSane> Night

<SuperBrony64> 10,02So...did I miss movie night? :3
<SteveCharb> to quote the great Mike Kristopelt
<metalrainbowdashchan> shes just meh to me :
<RawketLawnchair> Gilda is a jerk, yes.
<pwny> dammit RawketLawnchair, don't start that fight
<Princess_Luna> Who said they disliked Fluttershy?! I am outraged, she is so nice...
<lolponies> I dislike trixie
<metalrainbowdashchan> :P
<SlurryMoon> 3yes you did :3
<RainbowDash48> SCREW YOU FLUTTERSHY HATERS!
<Darf14> sadly yes :(
<MahBoi777> LOL
<RawketLawnchair> pwny, don't deny it, you know it's true.
<mario_pony> hey SuperBrony64 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc
<Fin> trixie fans come from EqD duh
<Kipkat07> EEYUP
<Shrimp3000> Is the stream down?
<lolponies> While i woud like her to come back, gilda can stay the hell away
<SuperBrony64> 10,02LEAVE FLUTTERSHY ALONE
<RawketLawnchair> Fluttershy fans are batshit insane.
<Tovler> it was too 80s
<Topgearbrony> I prefer flutterbitch
<TOY_PON3> Tolver: Indeed I love the soundtrack
<pwny> Trixie: Showmare. Got heckled at a show, and plot demanded that she lose everything she had.
<RawketLawnchair> That's all there is to say on the matter.
<tisaname> fuck off
<SteveCharb> somepony said they didn't like fluttershy because of the moe stereotype in anime
<MahBoi777> ironic ain't it?
<Buytoast> I'm a Fluttershy fan and I'm not completely insane.
<RainbowDash48> FLUTTERSHY IS THE EPIC ONE!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat ValtheJean
<metalrainbowdashchan> I also prefer flutterbitch
<metalrainbowdashchan> at least she has GUTS
<Darf14> hmm.....do I dare buy a blind bag?
<SteveCharb> but that was so stupid because she's not a moe stereotype in an anime
<lolponies> flutterage?
<metalDarkTwilightSpa> Pwny :'(
<deathfire365> so is the clock accurate? the mare-o-thon starts at 6a.m.est
<pwny> Gilda: Wanted to spend time with a friend, and Pinkie kept interrupting. Have one bad day, the entire fandom hates you.
<lolponies> what about speed and agility?
<OhioBronyShow> I'm moving to Germany just so I can get a McScootaloo.
<gaybrony91> I love every character because they're all so different.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02mario_pony: i liek dat video :3
<MahBoi777> you'd think the fans wud be calm, nnnnope, they insane
<SteveCharb> Cult Leader Fluttershy is such a badass
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dat...superbrony?
<flutter_spin> I'm actually waiting for the new McDonalds set in March.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So we meet again...
<Princess_Cadence> Dumb streem
<Princess_Luna> SINCE EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY, IT IS INCORRECT TO DISCRI MINATE OR ELECT ANY PARTICULAR PONY IN A BEST OF ALL ROLE SINCE THERE IS NOT ONE WHO CAN FIT THAT TITLE PERFECTLY.
<flutter_spin> Too bad they look the same as the last McDonalds set
<Fin> aaaannnnnnd I jacked first comment... Yay~
*Tovler laughs just thinking about the 80s Transformers movie
<magicman> no fandom is without it insane section
<ncb_LuckyStampede> waaiting, is the hardest part
<RawketLawnchair> Celestia is best Princess.
<StinkomanFan> UHF was an amazing movie
<OhioBronyShow> With an addition to Lilyblossom.
<Phase4> ohai Princess_Luna
<SteveCharb> they do?
<Phase4> and Princess_Cadence
<pwny> horseapples, Luna is best princess
<gaybrony91> NO, LUNA!
<Simon2> dat SuperBrony64
*TOY_PON3 laughs because the movie was actually one big ass commercial
<tisaname> i actually love all ponies equally without any discrimination....
<metalrainbowdashchan> NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS DANG IT >_<
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat Simon2 :D
<Princess_Cadence> Hi
*MahBoi777 's brain is now pudding
<Dynamic_Brony> DEBATE!!!
<Phase4> and i'm back from kinda working
<ncb_LuckyStampede> just making sure, this is endless buffering for everypony else?
<magicman> Luna wins in my book
<RawketLawnchair> At least Celestia has had more screentime than Luna.
<SteveCharb> I thought they were just using the 2011 picture in the news announcement
*Tovler shutters thinking about Weird Al as Rambo in UHF
<pwny> One princess has the name Molestia/Trollestia. The other does not. QED, Luna.
<SteveCharb> has there been any additional news about mcdonalds?
<metalDarkTwilightSpa> Nightmare before christmas... nah
<Princess_Luna> What? I'm not best Princess?! Hi Phase4. Have I met you or have you confused me with another?
<flutter_spin> no. Go to happymeal.com
<TOY_PON3> Ughh
<MahBoi777> Wayne's world?
<Sumica> 00,10it's still bad for you
<Phase4> Princess_Luna: i'm just saying hi
<WRITEity> well, I think FiM has proven that something being a long ass commercial can still be good.
<Topgearbrony> yes Wayne's World!
<pwny> I'm still sort of scared about that buffering you guys
<Simon2> I see nothing on the stream
<MahBoi777> ohai Phase4
<JoachR> luna is frosty
<Princess_Luna> Oh, well hello, nice to meet you.
<WRITEity> hell, Digimon did that a decade ago.
<Princess_Cadence> :(
<Darf14> ......im going to do it......once those Mc Donalds toys are on shelves I will order two meals, one that I will usually buy and one I will say that its for my niece.... they will never know...*gulp*

<Sumica> 00,10two Princessessesses
<Phase4> lets not forget pokemon too
<Fin> And thay all lived happly ever after -Fin
<MahBoi777> that's all folks
<Luna> 07,01hit control + f5
<metalDarkTwilightSpa> HUZZZAH!
<TOY_PON3> Well if that's the case then FiM is the best commercial ever
<Princess_Cadence> is not working for me and I have refreshed
<SteveCharb> I'm going in loud and proud asking for my little pony toys
<Princess_Luna> Is that a problem @Sumica?
<Monkey_Zombie> I'd just buy all the toys.
<pwny> IT'S A TRAP
<otakon> Thank you Luna
<Jaketehsnake> I would hug all of them no matter what
<ncb_LuckyStampede> I would hug all of the mane six
<flutter_spin> I just think it will be weird going up and saying "I want a happy meal... no GIRL toy please"
<WRITEity> well, the pokemon anime was kinda shit.
<SteveCharb> if they don't like it they can suck it
<Sumica> 00,10hit that f5 like it owes you monie
<Tovler> Well, the Digimon anime was actually good.
<Phase4> ahh, veemi
<Sumica> 00,10nope not a problem
<Princess_Luna> Good.
<lolponies> my stream is still buffering
<StinkomanFan> Ash Ketchum is an idiot
*Tovler cutes out thinking of Iris from Pokemon
<Simon2> still nothing on the stream
<lolponies> D:
<RainbowDash48> I WANT A HAPPY MEAL WITH THE GIRL TOY!
<pony_627> I'm very confused.

<flutter_spin> Yes Cheerilee.
<Tovler> my god, Iris is adorable
<OhioBronyShow> "Yes, I'd like all of the girl toys set...no, no food, just the toy. I'll be willing to pay." "But, we just don't give away-" "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY."
<Princess_Cadence> yay :)
<StinkomanFan> Brock was... there
<Simon2> yay Veemi
<pony_627> I just got on this site. I have no idea what I'm doing.
*MahBoi777 heads to McDonalds and orders everything on the menu
<WRITEity> it was good when we were kids and would watch whatever brightly colored japanimation that was on the TV. Looking back though? It was average at best in the early seasons, and now it's just kind of a sad little franchise still plodding along.
<StinkomanFan> Misty was a bitch
<Simon2> da fuck is this?
<Princess_Luna> Now it is lagging...
<lolponies> back
<Fin> we umm... what the cupcakes are we watching?
<Red_Pegasus> Lul jepordy music
<Topgearbrony> ya stream is working now
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<Jaketehsnake> MARS

<Simon2> can we have livestream instead?
<Shrimp3000> :D
<lolponies> YEAH!
<Tovler> Iris is cuuuuuuute <3
<pwny> I think McDonald's will just sell you the toy if you ask, won't they?
<Princess_Luna> This is Bill Nye.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Syrup
<Jaketehsnake> Sounds like the bill nye voice
<Fin> ohhh bill
<OhioBronyShow> Typically, they don't with me...our McDonalds in Ohio are tools.
<Jaketehsnake> OMG I WAS RIGHT IT IS BILL NYE
<lolponies> PONIES?
<Phase4> ???????????????/
<WRITEity> the biggest problem is that, because every new region means ash starting back at zero, there's no character development.
<pwny> Tis a lie, it's still bufferception
<Shrimp3000> Bill Nye the Crystal Meth Guy.
<magicman> mmmm... Syrup.... drool
<RainbowDash48> I hope the sell them
<Phase4> ^
<flutter_spin> And... Lily Blossom is the new pony in happymeal set
<lolponies> cool story bro
<Red_Pegasus> Little bill.
<Princess_Luna> ???...what is he doing?!
<Phase4> noticed that and dislike it
<Fin> I used to like him.
<RainbowDash48> ANYONE HERE WORK FOR MY LITTLE PONY SHOW? I DO!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ahh now i can see the stream

<Shrimp3000> Nope.
<Jaketehsnake> I met bill nye
<lolponies> HE DARED ME
<MahBoi777> u doooooo?
<OhioBronyShow> I wish.
<Tovler> WRITEity: It wasn't the case in Diamond/Pearl. in that case. iris became as boring ass hero
<pwny> as if by magic, the stream content changed
<Randomnerd> I remember when they called anime "Japanimation".
<Phase4> its why the first and maby second seasons are the only good ones
<lolponies> i gotta do it
<Simon2> the stream is lagging :[
<pwny> almost like it's technology
<mario_pony> fillyfillyy: yes there is

<fillyfillyy> im back
<SteveCharb> the day before the 2012 announcement

<Davie_Jones> Carddcaptor Sakura is still one of my faves and I"m gonna show it to my kids.
<Princess_Luna> Never mind...

<SlurryMoon> 3So tired |3
<WRITEity> also the problem of Pikachu, having been traveling with Ash for what must have been YEARS now, and can still lose to a newbie trainer with a fucking freshly caught Pidove
<Tovler> All I know is *The Guyver* was my first anime.
<RainbowDash48> i dont know you
<pwny> Cherry Pick.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> white tan
<OhioBronyShow> Cherry Stem.
<Fin> cheerychonga

<Ingwaz> so, in KoAR, dude offers to pay me off since i found about him murdering someone, offers a "heavy purse" i refuse and promptly kill and loot him
<fillyfillyy> ummm what is on the stream?
<SteveCharb> cherry pop
<Darf14> To be honest, I am terrible at pumpkin carving
<Shrimp3000> Oh you northern hemispherers.
<Ingwaz> i loot 17 gold off him
<Ingwaz> very heavy purse indeed
<Simon2> lagging in pumpkin scene
<pwny> Yes. Cherrypop.
<SlurryMoon> 3Welp, my little ponies, I'll see you for the early morning mareathon.
<WRITEity> my first anime, strangely enough, was FLCL
<flutter_spin> 8 hours? Maybe I should sleep. For the ponies!
<pwny> night Slurry
<Phase4> night SlurryMoon
<Princess_Luna> I have met another Rainbow who actually visited the studio and voiced Daring instead of Ashleigh. Sounds untrue but it isn't.
<Shizuka> 13nacht slurry
<Fin> bye then
<MahBoi777> chimicherry
<Darf14> night SlurryMoon
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Cherrypop sounds good
<Simon2> who's streaming?
<Tovler> WRITEity: You could say that about D/P but Paul was actually a veteran trainer.
<gaybrony91> Nighty night
<Jaketehsnake> IS the Mareathon going to be streamed?
<Shrimp3000> DUN DUN DUN!
<Phase4> !cd
<Tom> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 10 hours, 11 minutes, 22 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)

<tgl1992> THat was so racist lmao
<Phase4> ohai aussie
<Simon2> can we have LS instead?
<pwny> nopony cares, Aussie
<Tovler> They tried making Ash a Vet in D/P and it just wasn't compelling.
<ncb_LuckyStampede> As japanese as your average anime
<flutter_spin> No way am I watching the episode early
<Phase4> pwny: :<

<Randomnerd> My first was Bubblegum Crisis
<Jaketehsnake> @luna, is the mareathon being streamed?
<Fin> 4th wall BROKEN
<Princess_Cadence> I want those hair things
<Stormpony> I like how Bill blocked the L and it spelled TIT.
<fillyfillyy> i missed intro
<WRITEity> I really think the anime should have done what the Manga did: Every new region we start out with a new protagonist, new setting, and new storylines.
*fillyfillyy cries
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hell Teacher Nūbē i think i don't really remember
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ stream's back & Bill Nye is still on! The fun has been Doubled!!
<Fin> OMG
<SteveCharb> I saw it on Youtube
<Randomnerd> Well, technically, my first was Ranma 1/2, But it was the Manga.
<RainbowDash48> AM I RLY THE ONLY MY LITTLE PONY STAFF MEMBER HERE!?
<SteveCharb> I think it's still there
<Tovler> although, I would have preferred if Ash was ditched all together, like they do with Yugioh
<Fin> I have one of thoughs
<pwny> Princess_Luna: it was on Youtube for way longer than I thought it would be, probably still there
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> song!
<MahBoi777> it wud seem so
*Simon2 is sad because the veemi is laggy as shit
<gaybrony91> its all over youtube now
<Randomnerd> Tenchi Muyo and Record of Lodoss War after that.
<SteveCharb> how big is the staff, rainbowdash48?
*Luna 07,01will fix it
<Fin> I demand Oink oink oink.
<StinkomanFan> Guys I'm hoinh to bed
<Princess_Luna> I will be leaving momentarily, there are things I need to check...
<pwny> RainbowDash48: we all work on the show, we're just more quiet about it
<Darf14> Santa is not rea- *URK* --- its real....yes this is Daf45...... I like posting random junk and make dumb comments
<StinkomanFan> My head hurts
<Randomnerd> Bye, StinkomanFan
<flutter_spin> F5 worked.
<Red_Pegasus> RainbowDash, you are not apart of the Staff.
<lolponies> woudl you guys prefer livestream or youtube that's in 720p
<Phase4> night StinkomanFan
<otakon> My first anime was Maxstar 1
<Tovler> nite, StinkomanFan
<Randomnerd> Sleep well, dream of ponies
<otakon> from F.M.E.
<Davie_Jones> What do you mean? Yami/Yugi was the main character for Yu-Gi-Oh for it's entire existance.
<lolponies> i agree with red pegasus
<pwny> Now that Derpy is canon, the entire fandom officially contributes to the show
<fillyfillyy> youtube
<RainbowDash48> ITS BACK ON YAY!
<SteveCharb> how many people work on MLP to begin with?
<lolponies> oh god lag
<otakon> sleep well StinkomanFan
<flutter_spin> I like livestream with the reactions of everyone
<Simon2> You know what? LiveStream is the best IMO
<Fin> true
<fillyfillyy> if u play derpy rolled for me
<Cypresswolf> I forgot about the original videos...how could I have forgotten that?
<lolponies> why livestream?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night StinkomanFan
<pwny> the fandom can achieve anything
<Shrimp3000> We need more derpy episodes.
<WRITEity> Davie_Jones: he means GX and 5Ds
<Stormpony> Hasn't Derpy been abandoned because special interest groups thought she made fun of the less fortunate?
<flutter_spin> Refer to Derpy Live Chat
<lolponies> the fandom is badass
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Early 90s rap!
<Davie_Jones> Those are spinoffs
<Phase4> why is everyone talking about youtube and livestream
<Simon2> livestream is mostly smooth for me
<Phase4> Stormpony: nope
<Fin> best one ever.
<pwny> Stormpony: There'll be riots
<Jaketehsnake> Window!
<Tovler> Davie_Jones: You never heard of the card games on motorbikes meme?
<Red_Pegasus> Derpy isn't gone/
<Simon2> the others are a bit more laggy
<MahBoi777> livetube
<lolponies> no they said that no one is going to
<WRITEity> no, they're just continuations of the franchise.
