<Screech> markdie
<wipergone2> who is tht pony on right side

<Fallspony> no glowing titas
<OrderedChaos> thats why you sleep and wake up an 1hr before it starts
<Wrek> 05ANY talk about UNAIRED S3 episodes is completly banned.
<JPHyper> Vinyl nods in agreement
<Phase4> 00,02^ Wrek
<pony_8976> another thing is that kids probably won't understand this kind of plot
<Biltzwing> EVERYTHING!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02i'll hunt you down if you spoil anything
<pony_6977> japan has a low age of consent, i don't get that
<SpirittHooves> ALL THE THINGS
<Wrek> 05really
<GildedTongue> What the balls am I watching?
<fathers_tendrils> very lenient, but they can't show genitals at all
<Fallspony> whoah, i dont know anything to spoil
<fathers_tendrils> which is why the make movies like this.
<Wrek> 05you spoil and your ass will be the sorest in the universe

<aniderp> remember when dory remembered?
<Arc> Take LSD, Crack and Mountain Dew all at once.
<OrderedChaos> what?
<Fallspony> Love Machine eh? Nicee
<Arc> Then you'll have the creativity of this sort of level.
<Cocoa> I miss Pony!

<Arc> It exploded...
<Biltzwing> KA-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
<PonySuave> damn
<pony_2751> dat not friendship cannon...
<Fallspony> Like, being an animator myself, im pretty blown away
<Arc> ...then it exploded again!
<Fallspony> xD
<GentleStallion> Gelatine monsters, orbital cannons, This is pretty amazing
<Clear_Skies> it was hand drawn for 7 years, you know...
<JPHyper> orbital friendship cannon!
<SpirittHooves> there always great when theres a delay
<reinier> tactical nuke!
<OrderedChaos> Its has great things but its too weird for my taste
<fathers_tendrils> glass it from orbit
<fathers_tendrils> it's the only way to be safe
<shyezrylei> wow thats impressive hand drawn for 7 years
<aniderp> kiss her!
<Mister_Slick> ashes to ashes, dust to dust
<Clear_Skies> yeah, japanese are like that
<OrderedChaos> woah woah, what? really?
<GildedTongue> That pompador is immune to explosions
<Buytoast> this film's got some great animation
<Arc> Stuff her! Steal her car and win the race!
<Fallspony> That dudes hair... ITS SO LONG AND STUFF
<pony_7253> I can't speak Eglish
<Fallspony> Anyone reminded of Shaman King?
<JPHyper> ELVIS
<Sumica> 00,10there is a reasion the studio is called Mad house
<fathers_tendrils> nope
<Fallspony> Its more than elvis
<Clear_Skies> i repeat, this was hand drawn for 7 years, google it
<Fallspony> ITS REO
<Mister_Slick> she broke it
<shyezrylei> IMPOSSIBLE WOMAN!
<Arc> SHE BROKE IT
<Fallspony> SHAMAN KING DUDE WITH THE HAIR
<pony_8976> deja vu
<OrderedChaos> dayum then
<zombat2142> uh oh mental break down 2
<Arc> SHE BROKE HER STICK
<fathers_tendrils> oh sonoshee :(
<pony_2751> your car...its dead lady
<pony_7253> <3<3
<EventHorizon> Buytoast: The reason why is because each frame was hand-drawn, this movie took 7 years to make.
<Fallspony> her shoes have teeth
<Celest> To bad it's all over...for you!
<Buytoast> yes i know
<Cocoa> I can't wait..Pony!
<Arc> Her tits have numbers. Your argument is invalid.
<Fallspony> Yeah, animating hand drawn takes a freaking LONG TIME
<Mister_Slick> moral of the story, when something is broke, make it work anyway
<anony_pony> YEAH
<smelt> BLUSHING
<reinier> blushhhh
<fathers_tendrils> ~blushu~
