<Spyrorocks``> ah ok
<Spyrorocks``> well proxy protection is still in place
<RedDragonX> that is of course if Aristeo can find time out of his busy schedule :P
<Spyrorocks``> so once hes banned shouldnt be able to come back easily.
<Aristeo> Of course :)
<NightSeas> 12Well, there powerful, thin, and durable
<Stormy> do you remember someone called Orcsrdorks?
<Lambda> if by serious business you mean "hey Aristeo, don't tell these guys that I'm actually a hallucination," then yes
<Stormy> The spammer had the same IP
<NightSeas> 12That, or a Gateway
<Aristeo> I need to re-join all the other channels I"m supposed to be in -- my bouncer seems to glitch sometimes
<Zoroark> dell makes good laptops if you're looking at laptops

<Zoroark> you're unlucky
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<RedDragonX> horray for responsible admins
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF is very unlucky :<
<drf|away> 03if you had drivers issues with NVIDIA then you're doing it wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<Zoroark> i've never had driver issues with any of the video cards i've used

<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<NightSeas> 12Some things apple makes are crappy though, like the iPad
<drf|away> 03Correction
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay basic consumer computers
<Zoroark> nvidia doesn't make motherboards, they do, howeve, make onboard graphics
<drf|away> 03Everything APple has made since the late 80s sucks.
<Zoroark> meh
<RedDragonX> doubt it
<drf|away> 03well, EVGA makes motherboards.

<Stormy> He never made any sense
<drf|away> 03right, back to the fact of the matter, MacBook Air is possibly the worst laptop ever made.
<junh1024> ^yer doing it wrong
<prince-dari> That reminds me when someone sent you a PM on Valentine's day ages ago, oh the speculation.

<Stormy> And showed it to spyrochat
<HyperMetalLugia> And it'll be 100x better
<HyperMetalLugia> !
<drf|away> 03and seriously, if you have a huge budget, you can get some really good stuff
<drf|away> 03get a Dell XPS, I actually kinda like Dell again now
<drf|away> 03those things are insane
<HyperMetalLugia> Like a gaming laptop :o
<drf|away> 03they come stock with an i7
<HyperMetalLugia> I have a dell XPS 700
<junh1024> Like a i7 which gets used 2% of the time.
<drf|away> 03and like a NVIDIA dedicated card
<HyperMetalLugia> That is from 2005 <3
<drf|away> 03i7s FTW, don't be hating
<HyperMetalLugia> i7s are fun
<junh1024> but you don't use it properly
<NightSeas> 12Actually, I don’t have the ‘best’ budget. But a pretty good one
<drf|away> 03why, just because I have hyperthreading?
<HyperMetalLugia> Till the other i7 users hate on you
<junh1024> not only that
<Lambda> was it just some random person or something?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<drf|away> 03well how much are you looking to spend?
<Stormy> it was anonymous
<Lambda> orly
<Stormy> we were all trying to figure out who it was
<junh1024> because you don't use the cpu much, either
<Stormy> there was a riddle
<NightSeas> 12Around $800
<drf|away> 03you can't get ANY Macbook for that price
<Lambda> did you ever figure it out?
<NightSeas> 12More then likely
<Stormy> Yeah

<drf|away> 03before I go
<drf|away> 03the only thing I don't like about that ThinkPad
<drf|away> 03is that you have to get a SSD
<drf|away> 03As much as that's cool
<drf|away> 03I'd rather have like a 500GB normal hard drive
<drf|away> 03XDC
<drf|away> 03-C
<drf|away> 03that and 13.3" is kinda small
<drf|away> 03if they made a 15" version
<drf|away> 03I'd so want one
<junh1024> You mean you'd rather smash it on the ground AND lose data?
<drf|away> 03LOL

<Creideiki> An Osborne I with it's... what 5" screen is small. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm 1.3 in off :P
<junh1024> thats because you intend to turn any laptop into a media hub. which they aren't
<drf|away> 03no
<HyperMetalLugia> But Junh..
<drf|away> 03that's because I like being able to see the screen without straining my eyes
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop IS my media hub
<drf|away> 03the ability to watch high def videos is also aplus :P
<NightSeas> 12I like 0.1 size screens :D
<junh1024> i was referring to the HD

<Stormy> I don't care what SR says about it
<Stormy> I'm pretty sure my dad can see my browsing history
<RedDragonX> oh yeah
<RedDragonX> what did SR say?
<Rurik> 4Delete it?
<Stormy> It's impossible
<RedDragonX> you can't delete it
<Rurik> 4Flee for the hills?
<RedDragonX> you can clear it
<Stormy> There's no way you could see it through the router
<RedDragonX> but anyone who can access a router can get it
<Stormy> I could clear it from my computer, but that would do nothing
<Stormy> It would already be in the access log or whatever
<RedDragonX> do yourself a favor and don't do anything SR says
<RedDragonX> it's either BS or illegal
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Rora
<Lambda> and SR said that's bs?
<Stormy> He said there would be no way anyone could see the websites I've been to through the router
<RedDragonX> yeah right
<Stormy> without actually going to my computer and looking at my history
<RedDragonX> if you have wireshark you could do it
<prince-dari> What makeyou think your dad can anyway?
<RedDragonX> by seeing where the packets are coming and going
<prince-dari> makes*
<Stormy> prince-dari, he's confronted me about websites I've been on before
<prince-dari> You could unlpug the router, might clear temporary memory.
<Armageddon> back
<Stormy> he'd probably notice
<Stormy> not a big deal though
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02wb

<Stormy> Probably
<prince-dari> So RDX likes ponies?
<Lambda> well crap
<prince-dari> That's why he drinks so muhc coke.
<Stormy> I'll take you to Cokeaholics Anonymous if you want

<Stormy> I've gotten too many viruses from ads

<Rurik> 4Dude
<Neon> It makes you more susceptible to malware.

<Stormy> Or I could for 3 months
<Lambda> [20:28] <~Stormy> I have to have Mcafee
<Lambda> [20:28] <~Stormy> For school
<RedDragonX> Kaspersky was good but it uses too much CPU
<Stormy> then I'd just have to get rid of it again when I go back to school
<Rurik> 4Why do they make you use it?
<RedDragonX> becuase they have contracts with the companies
<RedDragonX> to promote and use their shit services
<Stormy> Because the help desk is completly incompetent with computers and thinks Mcafee is automatically better than AVG because it's "not free"
<Stormy> -__-
<Lambda> their network doesn't let you on unless you fit their requirements
<Stormy> And probably what RDX said

<Rurik> 4I wan tit
<Stormy> I'm afraid to open any links now
<prince-dari> I still want those Rainbow Dash shoes more. :<
<Stormy> Because firefox is retarded and saved my tabs
<Stormy> From when my computer crashed
<prince-dari> Oh, I thought it was because your dad would go "BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBAN".
<prince-dari> Get chrome.
<Stormy> nah, it's because I don't want to get another bluescreen
<prince-dari> Chrome is good.
<Stormy> I have Chrome
<Stormy> But again, the adblock thing
<Lambda> chrome asks if you want to reopen the closed tabs
<Lambda> yeah, the adblock is dumb
<prince-dari> Adblock thing?
<prince-dari> What about it?
<Stormy> Yeah, like I was saying before
<Rurik> 4meow
<Lambda> I heard the newest version of Chrome's adblock is like the firefox one though
<Zoroark> what is this i dont even
<Stormy> Chrome's adblock doesn't block the scripts, only the images of the ads
<Lambda> like it actually blocks the ads instead of hiding them
<prince-dari> Ooh, British Derpy.
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130611881976.jpg
<prince-dari> You could just not be lazy and update your hosts file. :P
<Stormy> ...I don't know what that is
<prince-dari> You can redirect sites to localhost.
<Mikey> oh my god lambda
<prince-dari> So if something tries to load them, it won't load.
<Mikey> the wartortle in the suit
<Mikey> /what/
<prince-dari> Wartortle in a suit?
<prince-dari> Where?
<Mikey> http://www.owlpages.info/fantasy/viewtopic.php?p=143023#143023
<Lambda> This is AdBlock: the original Chrome extension written from the ground up to be optimized for Chrome. I was inspired by the excellent Firefox "Adblock Plus" project
<Stormy> prince-dari: this is the first time I've ever heard of that, so laziness has nothing to do with it
<prince-dari> Just download a massive a hosts files off the internet.
<Stormy> I still don't get what that means
<prince-dari> They have some filled with thousands of dangerous/advert addresses.
<Stormy> hosts files
<Stormy> meh
<Lambda> Mikey: thanks, I made that one day when I was bored

<Stormy> would clearing my temporary internet files work?

<prince-dari> OH LOL!
<Mikey> WELP
<Stormy> For firefox not loading the tabs I mean
<Mikey> gonna go watch some music award show
<Mikey> be back later
<Lambda> Stormy: I would think so
<Stormy> that seems like a serious design flaw to me
<Lambda> I agree
<Lambda> I prefer how Chrome asks
<Stormy> yeah
<Lambda> Firefox should do that
<Lambda> stupid Mozilla :P
<prince-dari> I'm sure you can specify in Firefox's options somewhere.
<Stormy> well yes
<Stormy> but to get to the options, I have to open firefox
<prince-dari> LOL!
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130610753804.png
<Stormy> which will open the tabs
<Neon> Barowl is talking about food again. :/
<prince-dari> You guy should make an IRC channel for your forum. Bring some people to the network.
<prince-dari> We could do with some more people.
<Neon> Yeah, but no one there is actually entertaining to talk to unless they're being trolled.
<Neon> I wouldn't want to bring a bunch of noobs/immature kids to the network.
<Neon> Excluding myself, of course. :P
<Stormy> Still, it might help spread the word around
<Stormy> And the noobs would probably only stay in the one channel anyway
<Neon> As long as they were contained I suppose it can't hurt.
<Neon> But how to advertise, seeing as it's forbidden to do publicly...
<Lambda> just to pitch in
<prince-dari> They won't be able to work out how join other cahnnels.
<Lambda> I agree that you should try getting it
<Lambda> a channel for OFF
<Stormy> Talk to the forum admin
<Stormy> See if you can make it the official channel so it's OK to advertise
<Lambda> I would be a member of this new channel for sure
*Ray goes to sleep
<Stormy> I'd do it but no one knows who I am there
<Lambda> same
<Neon> Hm... he might not go for it, but if he doesn't I suppose I could set it up.

*Ray sleeps on Kosovo's head
<Neon> And... it's away. We'll see how that goes over with the head honcho.
<Lambda> Nice
<Lambda> let me know how it goes
<Lambda> if it goes well I shall add this new channel to the ones I auto join
<Neon> Scourge would bring up illegal immigrants again. She's so stereotypically Southern it's ridiculous.
<prince-dari> THEY'RE IMMIGRATING INTO THE CHAT!
<Neon> Want to see the message I sent?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Lambda> sure
<Kosoveon> ni ni
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Night~ z-z
<Neon> Hello, owlpages. There's been some interest among active members of the forum about creating an IRC channel that would work in conjunction with Owl Fantasy. It'd solve some of the problems of off-topic posting and the cluttering up of Open Discussion. If you think it's worth a try I can set a channel up with the help of some professional friends who host a s
<prince-dari> who host a - cut off.
<Neon> server on IRC. I feel that it might be mutually beneficial in that it would spread word about the forum while at the same time generating attention for the server itself. Is this something you'd approve of?

<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Rora
*Aurora faceslams into nearest pillow
<eXAKR> Roara
<eXAKR> Have you seen a doctor for the swallowing problem?
<eXAKR> I was worried about that
<Aurora> I literally just woke up, I haven't even gotten out of bed
<Aurora> I just grabbed the laptop
<Aurora> um, no not yet
<Aurora> I'm actually giving it another day or so
<Aurora> this morning it seems to be beter
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> Good to hear but
<Aurora> I'm trying to think of all the things I ate this weekend, i wonder if maybe it was food allergy
<Aurora> or something
<eXAKR> Do see a doctor soon
<eXAKR> Could be
<eXAKR> Peanuts?
<Aurora> 6no, if it's a food allergy, it's new. I've never been allergic to food
<Aurora> 6no I aven't had peanuts
<eXAKR> hmmm
<Aurora> 6can air allergens cause throat prblems?
<Aurora> 6maybe it wasn't food at all
<eXAKR> anyway bedtime soon for me
<eXAKR> Could be Roara
<eXAKR> Have you been somewhere dusty?
<Aurora> 6lol my whole hometown
<Aurora> 6is farmland
<Aurora> 6everyone here has allergies
<eXAKR> Ack
<eXAKR> Nasty
<Aurora> 6even if you dont naturally have them, you get them by living here
<Aurora> 6I just recently developed allergies 5 years ago
<eXAKR> Ouch
<eXAKR> I have no allergies as far as I know
<eXAKR> Which is lucky for me
<eXAKR> I can eat practically anything
<lightumbreon> there is risk of Q-Fever in my town :?
<lightumbreon> *:/
<eXAKR> Though I'm sensitive to strong smells
<eXAKR> Cigarette smoke, alcohol fumes, chemical smells, etc.
<Aurora> 6same here eXAKR
<Aurora> 6same to all of that
<Aurora> 6I'm starting to think this may be allergies..
<Aurora> 6thing is, my allergies kick up late march-mid april
<Aurora> 6and they didn't this year
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Aurora> 6I went through maybe 4 days of it
<eXAKR> Whatever it is, do see a doctor soon
<Aurora> 6and then I was fine
<Aurora> 6yeh I'll let it go another day, if it's like this toimorrow
<Aurora> 6I'm going to mention it
<Aurora> 6that's the most successful way to get me to stop eating so much lol
<eXAKR> heh
<HyperMetalLugia> Meh, most of my alleriges are acting up too x.x

<Stormy> Apparently
<RedDragonX> well if SR knows this why doesn't he do shit about it
<Stormy> He gave him a warning
<Stormy> And said to ban him if he does anything else
<Stormy> It's like T3h0v4llu all over again
<RedDragonX> alright if that's what he wants but just about every post he makes is trolling

<Angel_Espeon> 13Ray needs to procrastinate moar
<Ray||Homework> 02NUUUUU.
<Ray||Homework> 02Homework, now.
<Aurora> 6I'm the best procrastinator ever
<Aurora> 6mainly because I only work under pressure
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ray||Homework> 02Aurora vs Angel. GOD tier fight
<Manlyguy> World's longest battle?
<drfsupercenter> 03I procrastinate so much that my work ususally never gets done :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Aurora> 6ok well
<Aurora> 6I can't beat that
<Aurora> 6my work always gets done
<Ray||Homework> 02^
<Aurora> 6I just procrastinate literally up to the last possible minute
<Angel_Espeon> 13I give myself a time to start working, then I say "I'll do it in half an hour"
<Ray||Homework> 02Then again, ^
<Aurora> 6see
<Angel_Espeon> 13then eventually I either end up not doing it at all, or I find myself starting my work at midnight or something |D
<Aurora> 6we got a huge art prject in my 2d design class
<Aurora> 6to make a nature study book
<Aurora> 6from scratch, complete with layout, hand drawn images, research, cover, binding, everything
<Aurora> 6she gave us a month and a half
<Aurora> 6I started two pages, out of 24
<Aurora> 6didn't finish them, only did minimal layout for credit
<Aurora> 6did the entire thing within 3 days of turning it in
<Manlyguy> Hahaha, I used to do the same with all school projects.
<RedDragonX> amazing that we still take care of this site anyways
<Aurora> 6I always do this lol
<Manlyguy> Always waited for the last minute; always aimed for the minimum.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't finish ANY of my projects for Art GCSE
<Angel_Espeon> 13my teacher kept telling me I was gonna fail
<Angel_Espeon> 13yet I still passed with a C :B
<Stormy> It would be complete trash if someone didn
<Stormy> *didn't
<drfsupercenter> 03usually I just end up failing ;.;
<Aurora> 6manly, you're in monterey right?
<Manlyguy> Santa Cruz.
<Stormy> all that spam from three days ago would still be there
<Manlyguy> Across the bay, lol.
<Aurora> 6...close enough lol, but nvm then
<Aurora> 6I was gonna ask what school you went to
<Stormy> I have no idea why care though =/
<RedDragonX> well it's a good thing you were there to take care of it
<Aurora> 6but lol nvm
<RedDragonX> eh
<RedDragonX> I guess because of the memories
*Ray||Homework does homework
<Manlyguy> Nah. I was born in Moneterey, but I moved to a little town about 10 miles east of there.
<Aurora> 6what town?
<Stormy> Yeah, I guess
<Aurora> 6salinas- wait no that's further
<Manlyguy> Castroville. "Articoke Center of the World."
<Stormy> hard to let go of something after 6 years
<Aurora> 6LOL CASTROVILLE
<Manlyguy> Yeah.
<Aurora> 6I love that place
<Aurora> 6because artichokes
<Manlyguy> It's so small, though! xD
<Aurora> 6fields upon fields upon fields
<Aurora> 6I know lololol that's why it's awesome
<Aurora> 6its practically non existant
<Aurora> 6I thought hollister was bad enough
<Manlyguy> Pretty much, haha.
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> maybe the kid in me still enjoys the memory of Spyro lol
<Aurora> 6speaking of santa cruz though
<Aurora> 6I seriously need to go to the boardwalk sometime soon
<Aurora> 6I usually go like 6-9 times a summer
<Aurora> 6didn't go AT ALL last year
<Aurora> 6strike that, went once
<Aurora> 6as a spur of the moment
<Manlyguy> It's a fun place.
<Manlyguy> I'm trying to get a job there.
<Aurora> 6how was the 30 thousand+ people at the concert a couple weeks ago lol
<Manlyguy> But it's so hard since so many people are trying to do the same. lol
<Stormy> yeah, that too
<Manlyguy> Wait, how do you know about that? xD
<Aurora> 6dude
<RedDragonX> but I'm getting really sick of this blandness
<Aurora> 6 30 thousand people in santa cruz
<Stormy> too bad they're making this Skylanders stuff now
<Aurora> 6everyone within 50 miles knows about that
<prince_dari> Because games aren't made that well any more.
<Stormy> I really have no interest in that
<RedDragonX> neither do I
<Aurora> 6that was over double what people were saying was going to happen
<prince_dari> @pony
<Steve> 12prince_dari is 5Doctor Whoo11v5ves
<Manlyguy> I never heard about a concert here. Dang, I live in a bubble.
<prince_dari> Whoo. (:
<Aurora> 6.......LOL
<Manlyguy> Now I'm googling it, cause I seriously didn't know about any concert.
<RedDragonX> that and the blandess of the site
<RedDragonX> it needs a makeover
<Stormy> SR likes you
<Stormy> Just get him to make you an admin
<Stormy> Easy, right? :P
<prince_dari> RDX's face when I come on and talk about ponies: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130569271562.gif
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Stormy> haha
<Aurora> 6the going away thing for the american idol competitor
<RedDragonX> yeah right
<Aurora> 6I guess everyone thought for sure he'd make the top three,
<RedDragonX> I'll just up and ask him for the hell of it
<Aurora> 6which american idol then films their last songs at their hometowns
<Aurora> 6but he got sent home as the 4th
<Aurora> 6they had the concert anyways
<RedDragonX> I haven't talked to him in a few months
<Aurora> 6just no filming
<Aurora> 6I'm willing to bet the majority of that crowd thought for sure the film crews would be there
<prince_dari> He was planning on getting some old Spyro site and redirecting it to SF I think.
<prince_dari> For more traffic.
<Stormy> Yeah, SFA
<Stormy> I don't know why he'd bother, though
<Stormy> It's just an old proboards site
<RedDragonX> what site?
<prince_dari> He said it still gets a fair amount of unique traffic.
<Stormy> Spyro fans anonymous
<RedDragonX> oh that old thing
<RedDragonX> didn't know people still used it
<Stormy> http://spyro.conforums3.com/
<prince_dari> Finished watching through all the MLP episodes for the second time. :P
<Stormy> the most recent post was last week
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> Yeah, lots of unique traffic there
*Aristeo hugs Kitten and Emmi
*Emmi hugs Aristeo
<Manlyguy> Oh, so the concert was at the Boardwalk. I feel stupid. No one ever said anything about that. xD
<prince_dari> Just because people don't post there doesn't mean it isn't getting traffic.
<RedDragonX> 216 members
<Aurora> 6really
<prince_dari> They probably see it's pretty dead and leave.
<Aurora> 6I thought that many people would be hard to miss
<Aurora> 6even in santa cruz LOL
<RedDragonX> well that's all well and good but we still need some changes
<Stormy> bring money into it somehow and SR will be interested
<Stormy> maybe we could buy it from him or something
<RedDragonX> eh
<RedDragonX> I don't know
<Manlyguy> And I could see the Boardwalk from outside my house, too. I was probably working... or really tired. lol
<RedDragonX> last I talked to him about that he said he would never sell it
<prince_dari> Dreading any fans brought in by Skylanders, there'd have to be something wrong with them if that's what got them interested in 'Spyro'.
<Aurora> 6loool
<RedDragonX> well as much as I don't like this Skylanders junk if it can bring some acitivity to the forum I'm all for it
<Stormy> As long as it's not all little kids like LoS brought us
<Stormy> Ugh, that was annoying
<prince_dari> If you bought it from him you'd have to pay for hosting though.
<Manlyguy> Well, yeah. Hopefully I can get a job at the Boardwalk so I wouldn't miss those type of things anymore, haha.
<Stormy> Except for you, RDX
<RedDragonX> well it will prolly still be kids since it involves Toys
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> You were like the only non-annoying member to join during that time XD
<RedDragonX> eh I had my moments
<drfsupercenter> 03woah
<drfsupercenter> 03one of my mom's friends has tickets to be in the pit of a NASCAR race
<RedDragonX> at least the Forum had more mature members then
<Stormy> prince_dari, that's true
<drfsupercenter> 03and he's offering them to me
<RedDragonX> to counter balance the stupidity
<Stormy> I didn't think of that
<prince_dari> What happened to all our activity...?
<Stormy> there hasn't been a new Spyro game in years
<Aurora> 6omg do it
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Stormy> So no one cares about it anymore
<prince_dari> Hm.
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom's calling the guy right now
<drfsupercenter> 03making sure the offer is still good
<drfsupercenter> 03he has two tickets, so I can take a friend
<Stormy> Same could be said for forum updates
<Aurora> 6manly, do it and i can totally come visit
*Aurora 6runs
<Stormy> Nothing new has happened in ages
<prince_dari> The Spyro film might have been useful for new members if they hadn't canceled it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I might try to sneak in my HD camcorder XD
<Manlyguy> I'll give discounts for people who visit me. lmfao
<RedDragonX> he is too stubborn to change anything about the site
<RedDragonX> it's still running off the old phpbb
<Stormy> I still have a hard time believing it was real
<Stormy> the movie I mean
<prince_dari> Lol.
<prince_dari> Did they ever even make a trailer?
<RedDragonX> no
<Stormy> I dont' think so
<drfsupercenter> 03yay, Welcome to Detroit is on the radio
<Stormy> But from a financial standpoint
<drfsupercenter> 03I fricking love this song
<drfsupercenter> 03It was my favorite for like
<drfsupercenter> 03a year
<Stormy> Who in their right mind would think that would be a good idea?
<prince_dari> They made a poster for it.
<RedDragonX> it was about as real as Jamique or whatever his name was
<Stormy> yeah
<prince_dari> Stormy: There've been loads of films planned about games.
<Stormy> But for Spyro?
<prince_dari> Very few have actually been completed though.
<RedDragonX> which was such a load of bullshit it wasn't funny
<Stormy> Spyro isn't popular at all anymore
<prince_dari> And those that were failed.
<Stormy> No one would watch it
<prince_dari> Mostly.
<Stormy> Yeah, jamique was super annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tumblr_lka3tcdsql1qa0uujo1_500.jpg <- I love this song too
<RedDragonX> The only reason why I thought it might have been real at one point was because the developers of the game said it was being made
<drfsupercenter> 03but not quite sure why it was necessary to make it into a picture
<drfsupercenter> 03especially since they mixed the order up LOL
<Stormy> He got pissed and started whining at me through PMs when I locked his thread
<RedDragonX> he was just an attention seeking con artist
<RedDragonX> led people on about that shit for five years
<prince_dari> I've got further than he did in a couple days. :P
<RedDragonX> yep you have
<Stormy> Oh, but he's so busy! Give him a break!
<RedDragonX> the most he had to show was a couple of really shitty looking drawings
<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ground-zero-ad-fail.jpg
<Stormy> You're putting too much pressure on him!
<RedDragonX> if he was the head of game development then I felt bad for the game
<Aurora> 6that picture is HORRIBLE LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ad-fail.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03that is awesome
<RedDragonX> I don't give a shit if SR still wants to own the site and all that but he needs to at least get someone who will always be around to deal with the bigger issues then a mod can handle
<Stormy> Yeah, like at least that registration thing
<Stormy> that's bullshit that he put that in anyways
<prince_dari> On a side note, Stormy, my sister's 18th tomorrow, my mum got her a strawberry cheescake cupcake cake (wow, mouthful).
<prince_dari> Red...Cupcake.
<prince_dari> NOT WANT!
<Stormy> D:
<RedDragonX> lol Ratchet is part of that forum
<Stormy> SFA?
<RedDragonX> yeah
<Stormy> haha
<Manlyguy> Thos pictures. lmfao
<RedDragonX> or at least he was active on it at one point
<Stormy> Does TTE even do anything anymore?
<RedDragonX> and WOW they actually got images for their freaking ranks
<Manlyguy> http://i56.tinypic.com/14jrr42.jpg
<prince_dari> TTE?
<Stormy> Admin of SFA
<RedDragonX> a proboard admin has more initiative then ours
<prince_dari> Oh.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOOOOOOOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Epic troll
<Stormy> He shut down the site because he was mad about ANB
<prince_dari> LOL.
<Aurora> 6lololol
<RedDragonX> Jackson117 is part of it too
<prince_dari> Epic rage quit.
<Stormy> That guy is annoying
<RedDragonX> lol
<Aurora> 6I love that sign in the back
<RedDragonX> I found a post by TTE
<RedDragonX> it says
<Aurora> 6"come see us may 22nd"
<RedDragonX> Cynder is a "censored"
<Stormy> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Stormy> wow
<prince_dari> Hahaha. XD
<RedDragonX> guess that proves what Stormy said
<Stormy> I was around when SFA got shut down and all the members started migrating to SF
<RedDragonX> oh btw that last post two weeks ago was just an advertisement bot
<Stormy> I think that's actually where ratchet came from
<prince_dari> Do either of you go on DS, how are they doing in comparison with SF?
<Stormy> Hah, fai;
<Stormy> *fail
<RedDragonX> eh
<RedDragonX> I don't go on there much
<Stormy> DarkSpyro is really active
<Stormy> But all the activity is crap
<RedDragonX> Active with morons
<RedDragonX> but still active
<prince_dari> ...So why are we doing so badly?
<RedDragonX> because they can do whatever they want there
<Ray||Homework> 02Lmfao Manly
<RedDragonX> they dont' have mods
<prince_dari> Oh.
<prince_dari> Fail.
<RedDragonX> and an admin just as lazy as SR
<RedDragonX> simply put
<RedDragonX> I like the way the site is set up
<Stormy> Most Spyro fans seem to be around 9 to 14
<RedDragonX> it's just run like shit
<prince_dari> "We could buy the site off SR" - this is starting to sound like plotting revolution again. XD
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Stormy> Haha, no thanks
<RedDragonX> I missed the first revolution
<prince_dari> ^ Same.
<Stormy> Wait what?
<prince_dari> I just heard about it.
<Stormy> You missed both of them
<Stormy> I think
<prince_dari> Both?
<Stormy> yeah
<prince_dari> There were two?
<RedDragonX> oh yeah
<RedDragonX> forgot you had two
<Stormy> yeah
<RedDragonX> I got there just after the second one
<Stormy> We were drama queens
<prince_dari> Doppel lead the first one right?
<Stormy> No
<prince_dari> Oh.
<Stormy> The first one was in like '07
<Stormy> I pretty much lead both of them -.-
<prince_dari> Hahaha. XD
<RedDragonX> while trying to date SR at the same time :P
<Stormy> Shut it :P
<RedDragonX> XD
<prince_dari> Lawl.
<prince_dari> So was Doppel on your side, or what?
<Stormy> Doppel joined after both of them
<RedDragonX> Betwen Doppel and Ayumi it was extremely entertaining in the old days
<Stormy> I think he tried to start a third one, but it didn't work out
<prince_dari> O__o
<Stormy> The first one was me, Klone, and some more of our friends
<prince_dari> Can't remember when I joined.
<prince_dari> I think I used the IRC for about a year before I made an account.
<RedDragonX> you just joined randomly one day when we pushed you to do it lol
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I gotta go work out at the gym now
<drfsupercenter> 03so bbl
<Stormy> The second one was me, Klone, DragonSpiritPT, and DarkCynder
<HyperMetalLugia> *plays Punch Out/Rocky music*
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Stormy> And I guess you could count Zekira
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah anyway
<prince_dari> Oh, so I missed both of them?
<Stormy> yeah
<prince_dari> Aww, all the drama.
<Stormy> If you joined around when #spyrochat was made, you missed them both
<prince_dari> Damn the history of SF is colourful.
<Stormy> Haha, it's even better when you throw the stuff about LoneKnight in
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Stormy> He was involved in both
<Stormy> Trying to get us to stop
<RedDragonX> he was gone before I shoed up
<prince_dari> StormKnight 4EVAH! :P
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> then we've got Razz
<prince_dari> LOL RAZZ
<Stormy> Oh God
<Stormy> I forgot about that
<RedDragonX> lol
<prince_dari> Razz artist is best artist.
<prince_dari> Worship plzl.
<RedDragonX> well she had the personality of a toothpick
<RedDragonX> but at least she attracted people to the forum
<prince_dari> Why did she leave? XD
<Stormy> yeah, annoying Razztards who attack if you say one negative thing about her
<prince_dari> People stopped worshipping her?
<RedDragonX> ehhehhehe

<Stormy> She was picking on DDR in a thread
<Stormy> I went a little too far standing up for him
<RedDragonX> it was all blown out of proportion
<Stormy> She got really offended and announced that she was leaving everywhere
<prince_dari> Lawl.

<RedDragonX> he hasn't been back since
<Rurik> 4I saw him back once a few months ago
<Rurik> 4Spyro is a dip
<Rurik> 4really, he is
<Stormy> He has a life
<RedDragonX> yeah he tried to attack me when I was describing what happened with Razz to somebody else
<Stormy> Don't question why he's gone
<Stormy> He is so busy and has a life
<RedDragonX> he runs a campground
<RedDragonX> that's living?
<RedDragonX> hell I'll take my job

<Stormy> I guess it's worth it for the few people who buy into it
<Stormy> well, worth it if you don't care about making money in an ethical way
*prince_dari wants next series of ponies.
<prince_dari> Episode with Derpy. :D
<prince_dari> Would suck if they ruined her though.
<Stormy> There's not really anything to ruin
<Stormy> outside of the personality fanfiction has probably given her
<prince_dari> They could call her Ditzy Doo. :/
<Stormy> they probably will
<prince_dari> Lauren said the name could be Derpy if people wanted. D:
<Stormy> "Derpy" wouldn't make sense to the average 7 year old girl
<prince_dari> Meh.
<RedDragonX> btw whoever changed the topic will suffer
<RedDragonX> who was it
<prince_dari> You were there...
<Stormy> huh?
<prince_dari> You suggested it in face. :P
<Stormy> You mean where it said "EVIL DOER!"
<RedDragonX> I wasn't paying attention
<prince_dari> fact*
<RedDragonX> sarcasm no longer has a place in this world
<Stormy> Yeah, you were the one who told me to change it
<Stormy> because your link was broken
<Stormy> it still is, by the way
<RedDragonX> I know it is
<Stormy> It opens "draconicwolves.com!!"
<RedJolteon> Rawr.
<RedDragonX> Idc if it works or not on here really
<Stormy> But what was wrong with 4EVIL DOER! ?
<RedJolteon> Is anyone here?
<Stormy> :(
<RedDragonX> nothing was they're just obssessed with ponies now
<junh1024-XD> no
*junh1024-XD hides
<Stormy> Ponies? what?
<RedJolteon> X3
<Skylands> 10Hi RJ
<RedJolteon> Hey :3
<Stormy> The topic had nothing to do with ponies XD
<RedDragonX> PONY CHAT
<Stormy> Or at least last time I looked
<Stormy> Oh really
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> It was probably Lambda then
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Espeon> 06=o
<Espeon> 06hi
<RedDragonX> most likely
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya RJ
<SilverSonic> Hi RJ!
<Stormy> Probably happened after my internet went off
*prince_dari pony bombs draconicwolves.
<RedJolteon> Hi :3
<SilverSonic> *glomps*
<RedJolteon> X3
<NightSeas> 12Hello RedJolteon ^^
*RedJolteon is glomped
<RedJolteon> Hey GL :3
*Stormy turns into a pony
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai RJ :3
<RedJolteon> Hey Espy :3
<RedDragonX> what has the world come to
<prince_dari> Ponies, clearly.
<Stormy> XD
<prince_dari> If you'd just give them a chance RDX. :P
<Stormy> That's as likely to happen as RDX trying Skylanders
<prince_dari> Hahaha.
<RedJolteon> HML, I know you're going to kill me, but I switched over to FireFox.
<NightSeas> 12Yay
<RedJolteon> X3
<RedJolteon> That's how I've been going on deviantART.
<HyperMetalLugia> Die
<HyperMetalLugia> Why not Chrome
<NightSeas> 12FireFox shows web pages how they are really look~
<NightSeas> 12are-
<HyperMetalLugia> Chrome shows the pages at a nicer Res and there is less scrolling
<HyperMetalLugia> U mad?
<RedJolteon> Don't care.
<HyperMetalLugia> (EW 1000 toolbars)
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes you do
<HyperMetalLugia> You're such a fool!
<NightSeas> 12[15:36] <HyperMetalLugia> Chrome shows the pages at a nicer Res and there is less scrolling <--FireFox does the same
<HyperMetalLugia> Now you're going to crash
<RedJolteon> I bloced ads with FireFox.
<RedJolteon> *blocked
<HyperMetalLugia> I blocked ads with Chrome
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<RedJolteon> FireFox is the same XP
<HyperMetalLugia> Firefox is just a slower (way slower) reasource hog of a ripoff
<NightSeas> 12I've used Chrome before, it is good, but it don't have that really good firewall FireFox has
<HyperMetalLugia> Who needs firewalls?
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't
<NightSeas> 12lol
<RedJolteon> I do.
<HyperMetalLugia> IF you have proper AV
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> (I use chrome with NO protection at all lol)
<HyperMetalLugia> And no viruses yet :>
<NightSeas> 12If you like your computer you need one XD
<RedJolteon> I only have McAfee.
<RedJolteon> So I need one3
<HyperMetalLugia> I love my computer
<RedJolteon> *X3
<HyperMetalLugia> And I don't have one
<HyperMetalLugia> But baw2U
<RedJolteon> Meh.
<prince_dari> ...
<prince_dari> Lawl.
<Angel_Espeon> 13How about this
<NightSeas> 12HML, most viruses hide on your computer and just slow it down.
<Angel_Espeon> 13No one cares
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<prince_dari> Why not change the link?
<RedJolteon> Espy X3
<prince_dari> Since it doesn't work.
*Skylands seconds Espy
*RedJolteon does, too.
<Stormy> Because RDX will just change it back anyway
<prince_dari> Why?
<Stormy> I dunno
<HyperMetalLugia> http://blog.gadodia.net/google-chrome-vs-mozilla-firefox/
<HyperMetalLugia> And my lapto
<HyperMetalLugia> p
<HyperMetalLugia> Isn't slow
<HyperMetalLugia> And I scan
<HyperMetalLugia> But nothing comes up
*Espeon yawns
<HyperMetalLugia> Opinions, right Espeon :P
<Espeon> 06Yes.
<HyperMetalLugia> (Still can't argue with the facts lol)
<HyperMetalLugia> Have you even tried chrome RJ?
<RedJolteon> Yeah.
<NightSeas> 12Also, it's up to you how many toolbars you have on FireFox
<HyperMetalLugia> Not really
<Espeon> 06One can avoid most viruses by just not being naive and stupid
<RedJolteon> Didn't like it.
<HyperMetalLugia> It will always
<Angel_Espeon> 13If it's opinions, why do you keep acting like yours is superior?
<SilverSonic> ^
<RedJolteon> I have no toolbars.

<prince_dari> RDX is just scared that he'll like it.
<RedDragonX> my personal preferences do not revolve around ponies I'm afraid
<Stormy> that's what everyone says
<Ray> 02:P
<Stormy> then they watch it
<prince_dari> Lambda took some convincing.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I read that as "my dog is messed up in the head again"

<prince_dari> The_People had to demand that he watch it.

<RedDragonX> I'll be back in a bit
<prince_dari> I bet he's gone off to watch ponies.
<Stormy> Aww
<prince_dari> Trololo.
<RedJolteon> The reason he messed up my bed is because he was scared of the thunder XP
<Stormy> More like hiding from the ponies
<prince_dari> You can only hide for so long...

*RedJolteon died again.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Whatever happened to Andyman? I just realised that he used to be around quite a lot but I haven't seen him since forever o-o
<RedJolteon> Yeah,
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, there's quite a number of people who I remember used to be quite active then disappeared
<RedJolteon> Yeah, XP
<Angel_Espeon> 13Like Jet The Latios
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here
<Angel_Espeon> 13he only joined back in December or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> I wondered..
<RedJolteon> He's gone?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :<
<RedJolteon> Aw,
<Angel_Espeon> 13He came here regularly, but overall wasn't around for long
<Angel_Espeon> 13just stopped showing up o-o
<RedJolteon> He was my friend.
<RedJolteon> Even though we rarely talked XP
<Light_Latias> RJ :3
<RedJolteon> Lati :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd feel like a bad person if I said what I honestly thought about him, but he was a nice person to talk to :B
<Armageddon> Altair lolj
<Armageddon> lol*
<Armageddon> connecting to BNCs is fine
<Kosoveon> I haven't seen jet in forever
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again I ALWAYS feel bad if I find that something about a person bugs me, even if it's just something small |D
<Armageddon> but we have several servers
<Light_Latias> lol
<RedJolteon> XP
<Armageddon> I got another new server from leaseweb this time
<Armageddon> and peerblock blocked the BNC connection
<Armageddon> :|
<RedJolteon> Eh, my friend bugs me a lot, but she's still my friend XP
<Armageddon> heh, but why ARE you running that anyway?
<Altair> rofl
<Altair> ;)
<Angel_Espeon> 13But does she guilt trip you into doing things for her?
<Angel_Espeon> 13:<
<Armageddon> I hate you )';
<RedJolteon> Yes X3
<Armageddon> also
<Armageddon> I got sacred back
<Altair> not intentional but trolololo
<Altair> :3
<RedJolteon> She made me draw so many pictures XP
<Armageddon> and I have another server from leaseweb
<Armageddon> which has 5 IPs ;x
<Altair> :O
<Armageddon> and 1GB of RAM
<Angel_Espeon> 13I tend not to draw pictures for people unless I'm in the mood for a lot of drawing
<Angel_Espeon> 13which is rare these days
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Armageddon> I haven't decided whether to host a shadow on that or on the vps247 one
<RedJolteon> X3
*Altair needs to find out how you get all of these for free
<Armageddon> they're my friend's ;3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course, you should already know about that :3
<Altair> Ahh
<RedJolteon> I kind of like drawing for her, though.
<Armageddon> he bought all of them
<RedJolteon> :3
<Armageddon> and I'm like "wat"
<Armageddon> and I'm allowed to use them because I'm setting up his IRC network for him ;x
<RedJolteon> She gives me drawings that test my skills.
<RedJolteon> I like that.
<Armageddon> the leaseweb one is in the netherlands rofl
<Altair> o_o
<Altair> wekk'
<Altair> *well
<Skylands> 10Bleh, tornado sirens
<Armageddon> >:
<Altair> o_O
<Altair> Test hopefully?
<Skylands> 10No
<Skylands> 10Bad weather warning
<Skylands> 10on TV and radio
<Angel_Espeon> 13Jet made me feel like I was being pressured to draw something, otherwise I'd feel like a bad person if I didn't
<Altair> Oh :\
<Angel_Espeon> 13and always called me his bestie even though I barely knew him
<Armageddon> I think the vps247 is in the UK or some shit like that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel bad about thinking those things about him though, so ^^;
<RedJolteon> X3
<Armageddon> I'm probably going to put shadow on that one as it has ipv6
<RedJolteon> He liked me X3
<Armageddon> I'm not sure about the leaseweb one
<Armageddon> It looks like it has ipv6 but I really don't know
<Skylands> 10o.o
<RedJolteon> I don't see why.
<Ascendant> Everyone has different opinions.
<Ascendant> Speaking out your opinion isn't bad lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't help but feel like my kindness was being taken advantage of though :<
<Ascendant> >:
<Light_Latias> :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's happened to me a lot of times in the past by other people
<Armageddon> Skyla your vhost has been activate
<Armageddon> d
<Angel_Espeon> 13but meh, that's in the past so xD
<Skyla> ty
<Armageddon> derp
<RedJolteon> Eh, my friend knows I can't pass up a drawing request.
<Angel_Espeon> 13A lot of people know that I find it really hard to say no to requests in general :<
<Ascendant> Angel_Espeon, that's why I stopped being nice
<Ascendant> And stopped trusting
<RedJolteon> O.o
<Ascendant> Well not really stopped being nice
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd love to be more straight to the point sometimes, but I seem to have a fear of being disliked by people >:/

<Sakuya> That was retarded
<Altair> pfft
<Ascendant> o-O
<prince-dari> That's what your'e doing to me.
<Sakuya> i spent an extra hour on that exam
<Quilava> huhwhat
<Sakuya> Due to stupid mistakes on two problems
<Altair> i don't dislike mlp because it's for children
<prince-dari> Pffff.
<Altair> :P
<prince-dari> Why then?
<Sakuya> I would have been done within half an hour of starting
<Sakuya> Watch I get half of them wrong anyways
<Altair> well
<prince-dari> BCOZ IZ 4 GURLZ?
<Altair> perhaps because the majority of the fans are ANNOYINGLY OBSESSIVE etc
<Chimera> 04Lol wow
<Chimera> 04you done now though?
<Ascendant> .-.
<Altair> not saying the same does not occur within the pokeman community
<prince-dari> I don't see why other people are a reason to dislike something.
<Sakuya> It was open book though xD
<Chimera> 04lolnice
<Sakuya> I'm sure I aced it
<Ascendant> nice
<Sakuya> Just....my mistakes
<Chimera> 04Sakuya
<Chimera> 04did you hear
<Sakuya> I'm too stupid loooooooooooooool
<prince-dari> I'm not really bothered anyway, I just think you guys are missing out. :P
<Altair> when something you feel neutral about is thrown at you long enough, you either learn to like it or hate it
<Altair> i suppose i just went the other way :P
<Chimera> 04I spent around an hour on the spinning Pokéball animation and the loop is only 3 seconds
<Chimera> 04|D
<Sakuya> ..loooooooooooooool
<Skyla> did someone say ponies
<Altair> but yeah, why do you like it?
<Sakuya> Ok at my cat now bbl
<Altair> no
<Altair> :)
<Sakuya> ....car
<Ascendant> k
<Sakuya> 8x hxhx ffj ucjdjv jk if
<Chimera> 04You ever do something like that? Put effort into something so small it's neglidgable?
<Skyla> god i hope someone said ponies.
<prince-dari> It's just disappointing when people dismiss it before they've even watched it.
<Chimera> 04and k
<Ascendant> lmao

<prince-dari> Altair: I like it because it's funny, the plots are good, the animation is AMAZING, the voice actors are equally AMAZING, etc.
<prince-dari> Have you watched an episode other than the first two?
*Altair snugs a Quilava
*Quilava squeaks and hugs back

<Altair> ... wtf it smells like cherries outside
<Altair> brb
<prince-dari> Lol.
<AeroDracohem> x.x I can't believe I'm stuck on the first quest
<Armageddon> rofl Altair
<Armageddon> I can't stand all the fanatical idiots of MLP
<Altair> suddenly cherry smell
<Altair> ok, odd
<prince-dari> Well, I wouldn't call myself fanatical.
<Altair> anyway
<Light_Latias> I cant believe this
<prince-dari> Armageddon: Couldn't you say the same about any fan base?
<Armageddon> MLP is just more retarded.
<Armageddon> I've watched it and it's okay but really
<Altair> there will always be hardcore fantards
<Armageddon> the fanbase is more retarded than the show is
<prince-dari> I don't see how the fanbase is worse than most others.
<Altair> but when you go onto a site -not about mlp- and all you see is mlp, then it gets annoying
<Skyla> prince-dari, quick
<prince-dari> Fair point.
<Skyla> brohoove.
<Skyla> hoof?
<Skyla> hoove.

<prince-dari> God.
<Altair> time to put 4chan wordfilters into place
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> Altair
<Armageddon> remember I deleted the badwords.conf?
<Armageddon> ;p
<Armageddon> I need to readd it
<Altair> HAHA yes
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> you could still spamfilter it probably
<Altair> yeah
<prince-dari> I haven't seen that many bronies posting on forums that aren't pony forums anyway, just a couple of people who have ponies in their sigs/avatars, but they don't talk only about ponies. They don't unless it's on topic usually.
<Rurik> 4I'm still not watching the opening
<Ray> 02<AeroDracohem> anyone here play Monster Hunter Tri? :'D <--- I just turned off my wii DDD:

<prince_dari> I didn't like it at first.
<prince_dari> Now I do.
<Ray> 02Well, at least I completed my lagiacrus Set 8D ... but DDDD:
<prince_dari> I didn't like most of the song at first.

<Armageddon> lmfao
<prince-dari> I don't hate pokemon because you guys like it, I just don't understand your point of view. :o
<Altair> heh, once i got a new ethernet card it worked like a charm
<Altair> i use it for a media station hooked up to some huge tower speakers
<AeroDracohem> lol

<Armageddon> also quick PM
<Altair> honestly, i'm not big into pokemon much anymore
<Altair> i still haven't finished black version
<prince-dari> I kind of gave up on pokemon.
<Armageddon> lol Altair
<Altair> however, i still like certain characters, i.e. ho-oh and lugia :P
<Armageddon> I haven't even finished HG
<Armageddon> actually I've barely started HG
<prince-dari> When I realised that all I was doing was playing the same game again and again with more watered down and crap pokemon each time.
<Altair> heh
<Altair> i had to finish SS
<prince-dari> The originals were so good.
<Altair> and yeah dari, sad but true.

<Neon> Can't tell if he's busy or if he ignored it. xD

<Lambda> hopefully he didn't ignore it :P

<prince_dari> Have you watched any MLP yet Neon?
<Neon> Nope, and I don't intend to.
<prince_dari> Ok.
<Neon> It kind of stopped being funny a while ago. I cringe at the commercials now.
<prince_dari> Heheh.
<Rurik> 4:D
<Rurik> 4The show is great
*Quilava flops
<Lambda> isn't it?
<Neon> Well, I hope the bandwagon loses a wheel soon.
<Lambda> you have to get a few episodes in, but it does get good
<Neon> And crashes into a ditch.
<Mikey> neon what pm?
<Neon> @Mikey: I asked Deane if he would be okay with us setting up a channel for OFF.
<Mikey> oh?
<Mikey> eh
<Neon> I think it'd solve the Open Discussion cluttering and random chatter that doesn't need to stay on the forum.
<Mikey> I don't know if OFF needs one
<prince_dari> When the next series starts I'm going to post ponies at RDX and Neon. >:D
<Mikey> most of the "random chatter" is in night flight and that's always been around...
<Neon> If you look around nearly every topic has gone off onto tangents.'
<Neon> So much so that I got tired of trying to police them all
<Mikey> well then we can work on enforcing more rules, getting one of the admin's to post a public reminder to stay on topic?
<Stormy> Well, we were talking about this here earlier
<Neon> We can do both. I think it would benefit the server (in drawing more attention and publicity) as well as maybe give some of the members who have been clamoring for a chatbox all these years an outlet for their off-topic banter.
<Stormy> We thought it could bring more people for epic-chat
<Neon> I'm not saying this is going to solve everything, but it would make it less of a hassle to enforce stricter rules on the forum.
<Mikey> I don't see how it'd be a hassle
<Neon> If you think about it, we've been telling people not to go off-topic for years and it's never really stuck.
<Neon> I'm not just referring to new people, it's the older members perhaps even more so.
<Lambda> I think it'd be easier to get to know everyone that way too
<Lambda> I certainly know all you guys more from here than SF or OFF
<Neon> Mhm. The only thing I'm worried about is people spilling in from #owlfantasy into here...
<Lambda> like what happened to Spyrochat around the time I joined...
<Stormy> It could be like the old #spyrochat days though
<Mikey> well I gotta go to the store, be back later
<Lambda> vulcan and crew
<prince_dari> They won't be able to work out how to join other channels. :P
<Stormy> Annoying people like Ayumi popping up every minute
<Stormy> And yeah, what dari said
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> replace Ayumi with Ammeg and tada!
<Lambda> OFF IRC
<Neon> @Dari: Some of them are actually pretty competent, and they could easily teach the noobs how to hop channels.
<prince_dari> [04:29] * Mikey (IceChat7@A1DBB3.777392.C34CEA.257E51) Quit (Quit: they believe in me like no one else ever has) RAGE QUIT!

<Rurik> 4Ayumi
<Lambda> jk at my last comment
<Rurik> 4I dunt want more Wolfaboos
<Neon> xD I was about to say. Textbook ragequit.
<Lambda> Ammeg may be annoying
<prince_dari> LOL
<prince_dari> That word.
<prince_dari> I like it.
<Lambda> but she's no Ayumi
<Stormy> I agree, but he was good for laughs
<Neon> Ancient Winds is worse.
<Neon> Ammeg is almost tolerable.
<Lambda> yeah AW can be bad too
<Rurik> 4I can tell I am gonna have a lot of fun cutting em down
<Lambda> I personally am glad pianomaestro never seems to be there
<Lambda> he always annoyed me
<Neon> I love how I've literally owned every single debate in that philosophical discussion thread. xD
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> [22:30] <~Stormy> I agree, but he was good for laughs If he were here, you know what I bet he'd say to that, based on what I've heard?
<Lambda> FU
<Stormy> Yes
<Stormy> exactly
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> :P
<Rurik> 4Or
<Rurik> 4'I'm a wolf.'
<Lambda> He certainly made Dances With Wolves enjoyable when we watched it
<Lambda> ^for that reason
<Stormy> ahahaha
<Rurik> 4Seriously
<Rurik> 4He makes people with Aspergers look retarded
<Stormy> Who was it that died because he was hit on the head with Ayumi's wiimote when he lost at Brawl?
<Lambda> that was a buffalo
<Stormy> oh yeah
<Stormy> XD
<Rurik> 4LOLWUT
<Lambda> some buffalo was hit by an arrow in the movie
<Lambda> but you couldn't see the arrow
<Lambda> it looked like it just flat out died
<Lambda> so we said that Ayumi was playing brawl off camera
<Lambda> rage quit
<Lambda> and threw the wiimote
<Rurik> 4Oh
<Lambda> which killed the buffalo
<Rurik> 4Good man
<Lambda> Kevin Costner's real Indian name was Brawls With Ayumis
<Lambda> but for some reason this was changed before the movie was released
<Rurik> 4So my mom just walked in on me watching MLP
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Neon> Lambda: He has "split personalities," and created several accounts.
<Neon> BRAWL ME
<Neon> Hey, Lambda...
<Neon> look into ur past
<Neon> realise ur a dick
<Rurik> 4Convo went awkward
<Lambda> hahaha
<Rurik> 4I told her I grew a hairer chest
<Rurik> 4and she left

<Stormy> Nyan
<NeonII> I'm far more useful than last year's model.
<Stormy> Oh, Lambda, dari and I were right
<Lambda> About what?
<Stormy> RDX didn't come back
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> My bad :P
<NeonII> I'm not surprised. He was really pissed off.
<Lambda> well, he will be back eventually
<Lambda> he probably just hasn't been by his computer since it pinged out
<Lambda> working or something
<NeonII> If he does, he'll be gone again at the drop of a hoof. xD
<Rurik> 4Talking to h im now
<Lambda> oh, nevermind
<Lambda> I was wrong again
<Stormy> He just hates us
<Stormy> except rurik
<Stormy> Because he's talking to him
<Rurik> 4Yeah, he hates you guys
<Rurik> 4Like
<Rurik> 4He's actually pissed off
<Lambda> wait, really?
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> if he is I'm really sorry
<Lambda> I don't mean to piss anyone off
<NeonII> I could tell you guys were pushing him last night.
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 13Venipede.
<Rurik> 4Yeah
<Neon> But I think hate is a bit of an exaggeration.
<Rurik> 4That's kinda why I stopped and resorted to barely coming on here today
<Rurik> 4That and talking to people
<Stormy> I didn't expect him to get mad about something like that
<Lambda> I didn't even realize
<Lambda> I didn't think he would either
<Stormy> Doesn't seem like him
<Rurik> 4Well
<Lambda> He always acts like he's mad like that
<Rurik> 4You guys did go off continoiously
<Lambda> to me at least
<Lambda> I never realized it was serious
<Rurik> 4when he asked you multiple times to stop
<Rurik> 4I picked up right on it
<Rurik> 4Not last night
<Rurik> 4but today I did
<Stormy> See, if I had gotten a direct "Stop talking about ponies now" I would have realized
<Neon> I didn't want to look like a certain phallic organ, so I didn't speak up, but it was clear to me at least.
<Stormy> lol Neon
<Lambda> heh
<Lambda> Yeah, it really didn't seem clear to me either
<Rurik> 4Ha
<Rurik> 4Well
<Rurik> 4Now we know
<Lambda> like I said he always acts that way to me
<Stormy> Yeah
<Neon> So let's do it moooooore!
<Rurik> 4He says he doesn't care about if we like it
<Rurik> 4but to take it to another channel
<Lambda> like Stormy said earlier
<Neon> Or to ponychan.
<Rurik> 4Cupcakes
<Stormy> I could tell he was a little annoyed at it, which was why I suggested the other channel
<Stormy> But not that he was seriously pissed off about it
<Neon> I can see the misunderstanding, because he just has that crass personality where he acts like he hates everything.
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> Exactly
<Rurik> 4WEll, you didn't hear it from me
<Stormy> See, after so many years I still can't pick up on people's emotions through text
<Lambda> [22:46] <+Neon> I can see the misunderstanding, because he just has that crass personality where he acts like he hates everything. Exactly my point
<Stormy> What I don't understand was why he didn't just tell us this
<Stormy> we would've stopped
<Neon> It seemed like you guys knew he was perturbed, though, especially when you guys said you were going to talk about it more because RDX said he hated it.
<Lambda> well, I knew he was annoyed
<Lambda> but not pissed
<Lambda> not enough to leave
<Neon> Fair enough.
<Neon> Well, I've got school in the morning, so asta la pizza.
<Rurik> 4War
<Lambda> See ya
<Stormy> Bye
<Neon> Oh, one more thing.
<Rurik> 4Pizza?

<Lambda> I don't know if you got Stormy's invite, but we made a #bronies channel
<Lambda> or not
<prince_dari> I should be asleep.
<Lambda> speak of the... brony
<prince_dari> Since it's 5:18 am and I have an exam at 9.
<prince_dari> XD
<Lambda> what time is it there?
<Lambda> ohhh
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> probably
<Lambda> what subject?
<Lambda> Ponies I hope
<prince_dari> English.
<prince_dari> Lawl.
<Lambda> ah
<prince_dari> I'll write about ponies.
<Lambda> You should
<Lambda> it's what you've been studying after all
<Lambda> Stormy needs suggestions for a topic before you go
<Lambda> have any?
<Lambda> here were mine
<Lambda> [23:17] <+Lambda> "Friendship is magic, and we've got a lotta magic here."
<Lambda> [23:17] <+Lambda> or
<Lambda> [23:17] <+Lambda> "That rainbow one kicked me."
<Armageddon> o_O
<prince_dari> I don't know.
<Stormy> I think I'm just going to make everyone op
<Lambda> Yay!
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> I'm already owner on 2 channels
<Lambda> I love ops for all and all for ops
<Lambda> I omly am on 1
<Lambda> and it's dead
<prince_dari> Can't believe RDX actually got annoyed.
<prince_dari> I thought he was just playing along.
<Stormy> me either
<Lambda> like, only me and Channy there
<Lambda> me either
<Lambda> I thought so too
<Lambda> he always pretends to be mad
<Lambda> who knew he actually was this time
<prince_dari> Oh well. SUCCESSFUL TROLLESTIA IS SUCCESSFUL!
<prince_dari> XD
<Stormy> haha
<prince_dari> Clearly he's just too manly for ponies (or not enough, heheheh).
<Lambda> it even got Rurik
<Lambda> that show is way better than everyone thinks
<prince_dari> Yeah, I was impressed by that.
<Lambda> everyone who watches it becomes a fan
<Lambda> he was here before he went to bed
<Lambda> this channel
<prince_dari> The problem is it doesn't necessarily get you by the first few episodes you watch.
<Lambda> yeah
<SilverSonic> O_o
<prince_dari> So people who expect to hate it, hate it.
<Lambda> like him at first
<Lambda> then, and I quote
<Lambda> "I'm going to watch episode 3"
<Lambda> next thing you know
<prince_dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> [23:03] <+Rurik> on episode 11

<prince_dari> Ponies are magic.
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> that might make a good topic right there
<Quilava> mm?
<Lambda> hey Stormy, is there a chanserv command that makes her auto-op anyone who joins?
<Stormy> Yes, I'll do that in a minute
<Stormy> I don't want anyone who joins, though
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> just us 3 and rurik?
<prince_dari> Oh, ChanServ's female now?
<Lambda> oh and Mikey
<Lambda> Channy's been female as long as I can remember
<Stormy> This channel is going to be vulerable enough to trolls as it is
<Lambda> she's Steve's love interest
<Lambda> but she loves MrBot
<prince_dari> Nah, we'll just love and tolerate the shit out of them.
<Lambda> XD
<prince_dari> :P
<Lambda> that's true Stormy
<Lambda> and dari
<Lambda> that's also true
<prince_dari> Looooooooool, bot love triangle.
<Lambda> Stormy, aren't Steve and MrBot gay for each other too?
<Lambda> I forget how the story went
<Lambda> I know there's at least one gay couple in there somewhere
<Stormy> Something like that
<Lambda> Hahaha, nice
<Lambda> nice touch, the last episode part
<Lambda> I like that
<Stormy> That'll be more useful when season 2 comes out
<Lambda> yeah
<prince_dari> All I talk about on IRC is ponies now.
<Lambda> me too
<Lambda> it's weird
<Lambda> eh, it used to be pokemon
<prince_dari> God, what happened? XD
<Lambda> so I guess it isn't so weird
<Lambda> oh dari
<Lambda> I almost forgot
<prince_dari> Yeah?
<Glacymr> 12i have returnd
<Lambda> I found an artist's rendition of Nyan cat
<prince_dari> NO WAI
<prince_dari> Link?
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/QxIQ5.jpg
<prince_dari> OH MY GOD
<prince_dari> SO MUCH AWESOME!
<Feather> 10bed tiiiime
<Lambda> probably the same guy from the Nyan Man video
<Lambda> you should marry him
<prince_dari> Definitely.
<Lambda> good news
<Lambda> epic-chat.net contains no active threats
<Lambda> according to google
<prince_dari> Hahaha.
<Stormy> Good to know
<Lambda> yep
<Stormy> I was kind of worried Aristeo had hidden some spyware on the site
<Lambda> I'm reading up on your tutorial
<prince_dari> What about the pony invasion forces it harbours?
<Glacymr> 12back
<Stormy> Maybe we could get some of the bronies from ponychan over here
<Lambda> Haha
<prince_dari> Ponies.
<prince_dari> Discuss.
<Lambda> it would get WAY crowded if we did that
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> That could be another way to bring more people to the network...
<prince_dari> Hmm.
<Stormy> I've been lurking a lot
<prince_dari> Bronies welcome
<prince_dari> NETWORK TRAFFIC OVERLOAD!
<Stormy> It seems like a nice community for the most part
<Lambda> yeah, I get that too
<Lambda> they do seem friendly
<Stormy> I'm just clueless about *chans
<Lambda> same
<prince_dari> ponychan is good because they don't allow porn.
<Lambda> honesstly I get confused looking at it
<Stormy> they might not trust me since I'd be just another anon
<Lambda> "Where are the threads!"
<Lambda> *?!
<prince_dari> It took me a while for me to work out that you had to click reply to open them. XD
<Lambda> oh you do?
<Lambda> that makes sense
<Stormy> I figured that out when I was lurking 888chan during their "raid"
<Lambda> I thought there just were no threads
<Lambda> and every sub-chan is one long never ending thread
<Stormy> haha
<prince_dari> That'd be pretty cool.
<Lambda> it seemed annoying to me
<Stormy> Do you have a tripcode or whatever, dari?
<prince_dari> Nope.
<Stormy> Damn
<prince_dari> I post anonymous.
<Lambda> hard to keep track of what everyone's saying
<Lambda> tripcode?
<Lambda> what the hooves is that?
<Stormy> It's the closest thing to registration there is on chans
<Lambda> oh
<Stormy> How do you think they'd take some random anon asking them to join a channel on some unheard of IRC network?
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> probably ignore it
<prince_dari> Somehow, even though all I'm talking about is ponies, I can't say "anypony" it just seems...Too far. XD
<Stormy> serious question
<Lambda> honestly
<Lambda> dari: same here
<Stormy> prince_dari, riverhippo on SF does that XD
<Lambda> Stormy, they might sign in, but I dunno
<Lambda> it might get overlooked or ignored
<prince_dari> Which board would you post on?
<Stormy> probably /www/
<prince_dari> Fair enough.
<Stormy> seems like it would fit best there
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> you don't think that if it did work it would get too crowded here?
<Lambda> I kinda like just the three-five of us
<prince_dari> Honestly, epic-chat really needs traffic though.
<Stormy> We have draconicwolves for that
<prince_dari> If you /list you see there's just about nobody.
<Lambda> not for pony talk though
<prince_dari> (nopony :P)
<Stormy> Right now it's just the same as DW only minus RDX
<Stormy> And yeah, this network could really use some more people
<Lambda> I guess, but like it's nice talking to just you guys about ponies
<Lambda> I dunno
<Stormy> But this is a show about friendship!
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> We should be making new friends!
<Stormy> :P
<prince_dari> Most of the ponychanners are pretty nice.
<Stormy> They are
<Lambda> I know they are, I just like small communities is all
<prince_dari> http://www.amirite.net/592407
<prince_dari> Lawl when this is negative.
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> it says -10 for me
<prince_dari> Yep.
<Lambda> I don't get it]
<Lambda> what does the number represent
<prince_dari> The number of people who agree with the statement.
<Lambda> oh
<Stormy> Minus 1 from me :P
<Lambda> me too
<Lambda> -12
<Lambda> woot
<prince_dari> Should open tor and -vote 100s of times. XD
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> cheater
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> Cheating is not the brony way
<prince_dari> Heheheh.
<prince_dari> Fine.

<prince_dari> That is strange.
<Lambda> there's a butterfly flying past
<Lambda> and I pause at that exact moment
<prince_dari> Ohhhh.
<prince_dari> In the foreground.
<prince_dari> That makes sense.
<Lambda> yeah
<prince_dari> I was thinking DAMN big butterfly.
<prince_dari> How did I not notice thaT?
<prince-dari> Ascendant is Derpy.
<Ascendant> i am very derpy

<Ascendant> bbl
<Lambda> I wonder if Spike ever feels excluded when they say "everypony"
<prince_dari> Hmm.
<prince_dari> Never thought of that.
<Lambda> XD at the outfit Rarity made for Rainbow Dash
<prince_dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qhM8gtL8Hs
<Lambda> hahaha
<Lambda> the part where they're herding the bugs makes me think of red dead redemption
<Lambda> there's a part where yu herd cattly and it's exactly like this
<Lambda> *you
<prince_dari> I've played it. :P
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I wasn't sure
<prince_dari> Good game.
<Lambda> it is
<Lambda> one that I've been meaning to play again
<Lambda> rainbow dash looks awesome with goggles
<prince_dari> Yeah, it kept me busy for a while.
<Lambda> me too
<prince_dari> Wait till you see/hear Rainbow Dash's song in the final episode.
<prince_dari> IT. IS. SO. AWESOME!
<Lambda> I did all the survival challenges
<Lambda> even picking all the flowers
<Lambda> nice
<Lambda> I'm looking forward to it
<prince_dari> I think I finished just about all of the offline.
<Lambda> same
<Lambda> none of the online however
<prince_dari> But some of the online achievements were too hard.
<Lambda> my ethernet port in my room is busted
<prince_dari> I really couldn't be bothered to get the highest level or whatever.
<Lambda> so no online for me
<Lambda> haha, I imagine
<Lambda> casts a spell to make them stop eating the food
<Lambda> but they eat everything else
<Lambda> XD
<prince_dari> XD Owned.
<prince_dari> What did you make of the guy who could disappear, and knew things about you? I was thinking he was the devil.
<prince_dari> In RDR.
<Lambda> which guy?
<Lambda> I can't remember
<prince_dari> In one of the side quests there was some guy who knew your name.
<Lambda> ah
<prince_dari> And he'd just randomly disappear and stuff.
<Lambda> I might've missed a few side quests
<Lambda> this one sounds interesting though
<prince_dari> Yeah, he was pretty interesting.
<Lambda> I should go back to my old save and look for it
<Lambda> do you remember where he's at?
<prince_dari> I can't remember where originaly, just the last place you meet him.
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> it's a recurring one then
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<prince_dari> I'd be surprised if you hadn't done it.
<Lambda> I probably have
<Lambda> and I'm just drawing a blank atm
<prince_dari> You say "Damn you", and he says "Many do".
<Lambda> huh
<Lambda> interesting
<Lambda> yeah, I actually do think I must've missed that one
<prince_dari> Hm.
<prince_dari> Well it's good, you should do it.
<Lambda> I know I missed a few
<Lambda> I'll be sure to
<prince_dari> Did you finish all the main storyline?
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> including the sidequest with Jack avenging John
<prince_dari> That's strange.
<prince_dari> I don't see how it would work if you did it with Jack instead of John.
<Lambda> judging by the sound of it I bet not
<Lambda> but I have a new playthrough going
<Lambda> just haven't played it in a while
<Lambda> so I should still be able to play as John
<prince_dari> Oh, cool.
<Lambda> is he this guy?
<Lambda> http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/14320288/images/rdr_0847.jpg
<Lambda> this guy looks devil-ish
<prince_dari> Not sure, I don't think so, let me check.
<prince_dari> Oh, it is him.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I haven't then
<Lambda> he doesn't look familiar
<Lambda> I found a RD wiki though
<Lambda> I can find out where the first side quest with him is
<Lambda> I bet I just missed the first and so couldn't do the later ones
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> it's called
<Lambda> I Know You
<Lambda> fitting
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> starts in hennigan's stead
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> only available for John to get that side mission
<Lambda> spoiler
<Lambda> oops
<Lambda> I should stop reading about this
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> it's interesting though!
<Lambda> Also, the final location where you meet the Strange Man, who remarks "This is a nice spot", is the same spot John is buried in the final cutscene.
<Lambda> ^woah
<prince_dari> Yep.
<Lambda> tomorrow after wotk
<Lambda> I am turning on this game
<Lambda> and playing it again
<Lambda> and coming on here of course
<prince_dari> Heheheh.
<Lambda> see how many ponychan bronies come
<Lambda> you know you have your earbuds in the wrong ears when Pinkie Pie marches off to the right, but the music goes to the left ear
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Lambda> FILLYDELPHIA
<Lambda> HAHAHAHA
<prince_dari> :P
<prince_dari> The vastness of RDR is amazing.
<Lambda> yeah it is
<Lambda> more games need that
<Lambda> I love open world games
<prince_dari> And some of the scenery could actually be considered beautiful.
<Lambda> I mean, I love spyro and all, but linear gets old eventual
<prince_dari> Even though it's just a game, some places looks really nice.
<Lambda> *eventually
<Lambda> yeah they do
<Lambda> I've sat staring at canyons and mountains for like ten minutes at time
<Lambda> *times
<prince_dari> Spyro Rockstar style, LOL.
<Lambda> Hahahaha!
<Lambda> that would be interesting
<prince_dari> Walking through a city of sheep.
<prince_dari> You flame them and the sheep police come for you.
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> or Spyro Noire
<Lambda> you are a sheep detective
<prince_dari> LOL
*Lambda hasn't played L.A. Noire yet
<Lambda> too many ponies
<Lambda> and Firefly
<prince_dari> I've just seen adverts, looks pretty good.
<Lambda> just watched Firefly
<Lambda> yeah, it does
<Lambda> it is from what I've heard
<Lambda> oh wow
<Lambda> Aristeo pinged out
<Lambda> dun dun DUN
<Lambda> wasn't me this time
<prince_dari> I also like the statistics they give you in RDR.
<Lambda> yeah
<prince_dari> Damn that's a lot of pings.
<Lambda> this is a long shot but
<Lambda> or not a long shot
<Lambda> a bold statement
<Lambda> anyway
<Lambda> I'd say RDR is my favorite rockstar game
<Lambda> I liked GTA IV
<prince_dari> I haven't played that many GTA games.
<Lambda> but all the GTA's before that I didn't care for like most people do
<Steve> 12 Hello, Guest50050 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> I like GTA IV because your character isn't a gnagster like the earlier ones
<prince_dari> Oh, what are you?
<Lambda> he's just an immigrant who gets swept up in a big mess of crime
<prince_dari> Ah.
<prince_dari> I wonder if anyone's ever lined up a whole town of people on the train track in RDR.
<Lambda> while trying to make enough money for he and his cousin to survive
<Lambda> Hahahaha
<Lambda> that would be funny
<Lambda> took me a while just to get the one
<Lambda> I don't remember what kept going wrong
<prince_dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> I think I always missed the train
<prince_dari> Yeah, the train was annoying to catch.
<Lambda> I remember trying to do that very clearly
<Lambda> when I first got RDR I went to a friend's house to playing
<prince_dari> I remember trying to jump a horse onto a carriage.
<Lambda> we must've been up 24 hours straight playing it that day
<prince_dari> Wow.
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> that game is great
<Lambda> man, I really want to play it now
<prince_dari> Hahaha.
<prince_dari> I didn't buy the expansion.
<Lambda> Hello Aristiguest
<Lambda> me neither
<Lambda> I thought it sounded interesting, but I preferred the game as it was
<prince_dari> Dunno why. Just didn't appeal to me. I don't think it could have really added anything to the storyline, or game in general.
<Lambda> no aombies
<Lambda> *zombies
<Lambda> yeah, agreed
<Lambda> I thought the story was amazing as it was
<Lambda> haha
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<prince_dari> Seems just like an SR move to me.
<Lambda> you have no idea how much rambling about that game I did to Stormy just to get her to not think I was overexcited about it
<prince_dari> MONIES!
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Lambda> and all it took to make her more interested was pointing out that Marston's a family man
<prince_dari> LOL
<prince_dari> Oh yeah, another thing I like is all the mini games in RDR.
<Lambda> she was under the impression there was no story and it was just a game to be badass
<Lambda> oh yeah me too
<Lambda> I am king at that one dice game
<prince_dari> Poker is fun.
<Lambda> I forget what it's called
<Lambda> Poker I suck at
<Lambda> always have
<Lambda> Liar's Dice
<Lambda> that's it
<prince_dari> Ah, well I started young with the poker. :P
<Lambda> I sweep the house with Liar's Dice
<prince_dari> Haha, you pro liar.
<Lambda> ah, yeah, see I've only known the rules to poker for a while now
<Lambda> dunno why, card games just never really work with my brain
<Lambda> I have to go over the rules and sets every time I play
<prince_dari> I think I only play Texas hold 'em poker.
<Lambda> oh, you know what's sad
<prince_dari> What?
<Lambda> one of the missions in that game I spent the longest amount of time trying to do
<Lambda> was shooting those damn crows
<Lambda> :P
<prince_dari> LOL
<prince_dari> XD
<prince_dari> I don't remember how hard I found that.
<prince_dari> Maybe I did too. :P
<Lambda> I didn't realize that you only needed to shoot the ones that were flying into the door
<Lambda> I tried shooting every single one with the shotguns
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Lambda> and they would just eat all my grain
<prince_dari> Oh.
<Lambda> and I would fail
<prince_dari> That makes sense.
<prince_dari> I was a pro at the knife game.
<Lambda> yeah, I didn't realize they could only get in one way
<Lambda> five finger filet?
<Guest50050> rawr
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<Guest50050> power went out here
<Lambda> I was decent at it
<Guest50050> not power, internet
<prince_dari> I'm struggling to think of something I don't like about that game.
<Lambda> Hmm
<Lambda> I honestly can't think of any right now
<prince_dari> Though maybe I only had minor complaints which are forgotten since I haven't played it in a while.
<Lambda> that was probably my favorite game of last year
<prince_dari> And there's SO MUCH that's right with it.
<Lambda> oh, yeah, probably
<Lambda> same here most likely
<Lambda> all I can remember is the good stuff
<prince_dari> Legendary animals were cool.
<Lambda> I mean
<Lambda> even non gameply
<Lambda> graphics, voice-acting, AI
<prince_dari> Though they were sometimes annoying to try and get to show up.
<Lambda> all amazing
<Lambda> oh, yeah they were
<Lambda> not enough of them either, I felt
<Lambda> it would sometimes be hard to find specific animals and flowers for the survival master stuff
<Lambda> I remember being online when I was doing that and talking to Neon
<Lambda> talking to him on XBL, not here
<prince_dari> Oh right.
<Lambda> that was back when my ethernet port still worked
<prince_dari> I swear I saw this one glitch with a carriage on youtube.
<prince_dari> It bounced up and down madly, then there was a cutscene and the sheriff commented on it.
<Lambda> Woah, no way
<prince_dari> But then it wouldn't have been a glitch.
<Lambda> yeah
<prince_dari> I'm confused.
<prince_dari> I remember that clearly.
<Lambda> it would've been a bug the developers noticed and instead of fixing, made fun of
<Lambda> Rockstar is definitely one to make fun of their own mistakes
<Lambda> they make fun of anything
<Lambda> speaking of which, did you ever go in the theatres?
<Lambda> funny stuff sometimes
<prince_dari> I went in one of them.
<prince_dari> The one about the snake oil seller.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> yeah, I went in that one and another that made fun of both feminists and anti-feminists of the time
<prince_dari> Lol.
<Lambda> it was from the satirical perspective of the anti-feminists
<Lambda> I forget how it went though
<Lambda> I think that was it though
<Lambda> there was too much else to do to spend my time in a theatre
<prince_dari> Oh I found it.
<Lambda> *than spend
<prince_dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2r8S4uke34
<Lambda> the wagon thing?
<prince_dari> Watch.
<Lambda> WTF
<Lambda> XDDD
<prince_dari> The ending.
<prince_dari> A cutscene.
<prince_dari> O___o
<Lambda> not there quite yet
*Lambda has had slow internet for some reason the last few days
<Lambda> oh I thought of another little touch that made me jump for joy the first time I noticed it
<Lambda> this game
<Lambda> has wilhelm screams
<prince_dari> Haha.
<prince_dari> LOL
<Lambda> we noticed it when my friend and I were playing
<prince_dari> Unicorn.
<Lambda> I just remember him saying "OH MY GOD A WILHELM SCREAM"
<prince_dari> I love that scream.
<prince_dari> When it is used?
<Lambda> random enemies will do it
<prince_dari> LOL
<Lambda> when dying
<Lambda> I know right
<Lambda> classic!
<prince_dari> Have you ever tried the 1-Hit-Kill on a bear?
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdENXifMyYM
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> never got it though
<Lambda> I'm just proud of killing one with a knife
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<prince_dari> You just wait till it's about to hit you.
<prince_dari> Then stab and it dies in one hit.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> it took two hits for me
<Lambda> is it the timing of it?
<prince_dari> Well if you time it right you get a 1-hit-ko.
<Lambda> nice
<prince_dari> If you want to perform a melee kill on a bear in "true John Marston-fashion", lock on to a charging bear with your combat knife (NOTE: in this instance, timing is everything). Be patient and hold your ground. Center your screen on the bear's head. Once the bear comes just close enough to almost touch you, swing your combat knife. If done correctly, you will kill it with one clean slash across the bear's face. If not, you will most likely die, so having previously saved your game in Manzanita Post is a good idea. One may practice the required timing in multiplayer, making it easier for your single-player challenge.
<prince_dari> From the wiki.
<Lambda> woah
<Lambda> that's cool
<prince_dari> I think I've done it once or twice.
<Lambda> I have to try it
<prince_dari> http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100531130849/reddeadredemption/images/d/d5/Rdr_achieve_bearlylegal.jpg
<Lambda> got to the cutscene in the video
<prince_dari> It'd probably look like something epic like that.
<Lambda> woah, what costume is that?
<prince_dari> One of the extras.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I always use the one you get the first time you turn in a criminal
<Lambda> because trenchcoats/dusters are win
<prince_dari> That's the "Expert Hunter Outfit"
<Lambda> and the one for doing all the challenges once it's unlocked
<Lambda> ah
<prince_dari> You had to pre-order to get it.
<Lambda> dang it
<Lambda> there was another pre order one I wanted
<prince_dari> And you got the "Deadly Assassin" and "Savvy Merchant" ones too.
<Lambda> I think it was deadly assassin
<prince_dari> OH.
<prince_dari> They only released one?
<Lambda> released one what?
<Lambda> of the outfits?
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<prince_dari> You can't get the others.
<Lambda> oh, huh
<Lambda> weird
<prince_dari> Only the assassin one.
<prince_dari> It was decided by a vote on a site.
<prince_dari> I didn't want to kill the buffalos.
<prince_dari> Since they don't come back.
<Lambda> but then
<Lambda> "Rockstar released the Savvy Merchant and Expert Hunter outfits as free downloads on October 12th, 2010 to show its appreciation to all the Red Dead fans out there."
<prince_dari> Oh.
<prince_dari> There's a Jackalope wut?
<Lambda> in the undead nightmares expansion yeah
<Lambda> one of the reasons I did want it
<prince_dari> The war horse looked cool.
<prince_dari> Pre-order only again though.
<Lambda> aww
<Lambda> I actually didn't know about how the bufflo can go extinct
<prince_dari> There was a glitch where you could get the war horse online too.
<prince_dari> If you had it.
<Lambda> I only killed them when I had to because it looked so cool with the herds everywhere
<prince_dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> I didn't want to disturb them
<prince_dari> Wow.

<prince_dari> Undead thing has a horse that's on fire.
<Lambda> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<Lambda> we made a Pony channel too
<Lambda> #bronies
<Mikey> omg ahhaa
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> hey
<Mikey> hi again
<prince_dari> Hey.
<Lambda> RDX doesn't like us talking about ponies
<prince_dari> REALLY doesn't like it apparently.
<Mikey> I forget how do I auto login to a second channel when I connect to the server
<Lambda> right click on the server
<Lambda> on the left
<Lambda> select "Edit Server..."
<Lambda> and go to autojoin channels
<Mikey> oh I just clicked add to autojoin when I right clicked on #bronies
<Mikey> same thing?
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> yeah that should do it too
<Mikey> yay

<Lambda> dari, hop
<prince_dari> :P
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> not you for some reason
<prince_dari> Oh well.
<Lambda> she must've forgotten
<Lambda> she said she was gonna do it for us all
<Mikey> oh cool I was wondering why my name was different
<Mikey> I got some pokemon cards and stickers at fred meyers :D
<Lambda> Mikey, Stormy's thinking of getting the people of ponychan to join this channel
<Lambda> what do you think?
<Lambda> oh, nice
<Mikey> .,...ehh
<Lambda> I agree actually
<Lambda> I like small groups of people personally
<Mikey> honestly anything with chan I just don't even wanna be part of
<prince_dari> If you've lurked ponychan you'd see they're actually mostly really nice.
<Mikey> besides I have a harder time making friends on the internet these days with people I don't know
<Lambda> I just feel like I couldn't if I tried
<prince_dari> Porn and hardcore gore images aren't allowed on it.
<prince_dari> So it isn't like 4chan.
<Mikey> OOH I GOT A RESHIRAM CARD
<Mikey> still
<Mikey> eh
<Lambda> Woah, nice
<prince_dari> Hm.
<Lambda> was it one of those packs where there's a guaranteed card?
<Lambda> or was it random?
<prince_dari> Undead also gives you a death horse.
<prince_dari> Which is near invincible and leaves a trail that kills most things it comes into contact with.
<Mikey> I bought the one with a sparkly snivy card on the front
<Mikey> so it wasn't one of the tins
<prince_dari> O__o Seems a bit overpowered.
<Lambda> Nice!
<Lambda> Dari: that is way overpowered
<prince_dari> You can't kill it by shooting it.
<prince_dari> Unless it's too the head.
<Lambda> I just bought a new webcam, and a dvd on amazon
<Lambda> but it needed to be so much money to get free shipping
<prince_dari> AWESOME!
<Lambda> and I was a dollar off
<Lambda> so I added a shiny dragonite card to my shopping cart
<Mikey> lol
<prince_dari> It also adds a unicorn which has a "permanent halo of butterflies and leaves a rainbow trail in its wake as it gallops"
<prince_dari> WANT!
<prince_dari> WANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNT!
<Mikey> XDDD
<Lambda> my stupid bank keeps refusing to let amazon charge me though
<Lambda> so my order keeps getting cancelled
<Mikey> D:
<Mikey> I can't believe how much some owl books cost on amazon
<Mikey> like
<Lambda> I'm gonna stop in and talk to them tomorrow
<Lambda> if I get up early enough that is :P
<Mikey> I was looking at resources from the owl pages on owl folklore and mythology
<prince_dari> Meh, it's 7:32 am now, I have to get ready for school. XD
<Mikey> some are like 150 bucks each
<prince_dari> No sleep for me. :(
<Lambda> D:
<Mikey> dari how are you alive
<Mikey> you like NEVER sleep
<prince_dari> WHAT 150!
<prince_dari> OH MY GOD!
<Lambda> Sorry for keeoing you up talking about video games dari
<Lambda> :P
<prince_dari> O____________________________________________o 150. What the hell.
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> woah, seriously?
<prince_dari> Lambda: Ah well.
<Lambda> 150?!
<Mikey> yeah
<Lambda> dollars?
<prince_dari> No sleep is sometimes better than little sleep.
<Mikey> yes
<Lambda> holy crap
<Lambda> dari: that is true
<Mikey> I wonder how much deane has spent on owl resources in total
<Lambda> you feel less weary
<Lambda> hm, I wonder
<Mikey> I can't find ANY owl lore/mythology books at my library either
<Mikey> there's only one that you can place a hold on and it's a picture book so it's no use to me
<Lambda> do they have GOG books even?
<Mikey> which sucks because I was really interested in the stuff
<Mikey> yeah they have all the GoG books you can places holds on
<Mikey> and you can choose hardback or paperback
<Lambda> but I assume you already have those
<Mikey> I don't own all of them, just some
<Lambda> ah
<Mikey> there's barely any owl books that aren't picture books I can order though, either
<Mikey> I was only able to order 3
<Mikey> that weren't children's picture books
<Mikey> throughout the entire sno isle branch in my state
<prince_dari> OH MY GOD
<prince_dari> IT IS TOO COOL!
<Lambda> oh wow
<prince_dari> MUST HAVE UNICORN!
<Lambda> XD

<prince_dari> That rainbow trail.
<prince_dari> Oh my God.

<Mikey> jesus christ dari
<prince_dari> Too much awesome.
<Lambda> !addquote <+prince_dari> OH MY GOD <+prince_dari> IT IS TOO COOL! <+prince_dari> MUST HAVE UNICORN!
<prince_dari> LOL
<Mikey> XD

<Mikey> DARI HAS NO SHAME

<Aurora> 6THAT is insane stuff
*Ray mainly uses Tenshi (or however is spelled) <3
<Aurora> 6Tenshiiiii <3
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Sometimes I jump and do attacks simply because it looks more awesome than attacking on the ground |D
<Aurora> 6SO COLORFUL
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Oh, and I've NEVER managed to understand how the spellcard system works
<Aurora> 6really?
<Aurora> 6what do you mean?
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13all I know is that some do actual attacks, and others don't :<
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6I don't really like that
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13the ones that don't do attacks, well I've no idea what those actually do
<Aurora> 6but I know that I use the non-attack ones to pay to use my higher attacks
<Aurora> 6they're pretty useless otherwise, imo
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Now I'm wondering whether I should get Hisoutensoku or not
<Aurora> 6DO IT
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13and whether it'll patch correctly or not since the game's only on my USB |D
<Aurora> 6at least for the sake of having it
<Aurora> 6we could totally try network play sometime
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13I think last summer I attempted to play against Craiglol, but for some reason it wouldn't connect us at all
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13even though we were doing everything right o-o
<Aurora> 6you guys need to use hamachi
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Oh, do I need to find Hisoutensoku with an English patch or can I just find it on its own?
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13since I already have SWR in English
<Aurora> 6well, UNL is its own game, different story and everything
<Aurora> 6so you'll need a patch eventualy

<Aurora> 6and yeh, no flamingos unless you count missingno
<drfsupercenter> 03to me they're all fictional creatures
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WHAT
<drfsupercenter> 03Missingno is nothing like a flamingo
<Aurora> 6which all have a real base of some sort
<Aurora> 6there's a form of missingno somewhere with a flamingo form
<Nick> lol why? xD when you look at wailord people are bound to think "Oh it looks like a whale"

<HyperMetalLugia> Hawk
<prince-dari> Red kites over Reading, I took some pictures.
<Articuno> 12Kite, not hawk
<HyperMetalLugia> Orly
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Articuno> 12Awesome prince-dari, I can't believe it ^^
<prince-dari> Only with a digital camera though, so they're not very good.
<Articuno> 12well I can tell it's a Kite ;>
<Aurora|Exam> 6oh my god that's a beautiful kite
<drf|laptop> 03what do you mean "only with a digital camera"
<drf|laptop> 03opposed to what?
<drf|laptop> 03film cameras are only comprable to like 12 megapixels or so
<prince-dari> A couple of miles away near where my sister's boyfriend lives we saw about 7 flying around in one field. That's more countryside though.
<drf|laptop> 03and now household digital cameras do more than tha tXD
<junh1024-XD> I know dis because I watched a walle-E extra
<drf|laptop> 03mine's an old one that only does 4 but...
<prince-dari> I dunno, the zoom on it wasn't great.
<drf|laptop> 03Wall-QE was 2.35 though.
<drf|laptop> 03-Q
<junh1024-XD> yees
<prince-dari> DRF: I'm not great with cameras. :P
<prince-dari> BRB
<junh1024-XD> they were trying to simulate the look of anamorphic panavision camera.
<drf|laptop> 03so Jurassic Park is natively stratched?
<junh1024-XD> duno
<drf|laptop> 03I just don't get how that works
<junh1024-XD> look at lights. if they go from circle to oval, when it defocuses, it's anamorphic.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, I get how anamorphic works if it's already filmed and is PROCESSED that way
<drf|laptop> 03but if hte camera has a lens of 2.35:1, how would you make that 1.85 without making everything look stretched in processing
<drf|laptop> 03besides cropping, which is what people used to do
<drf|laptop> 03hence open mattinmg
<drf|laptop> 03-m
<Articuno> 12I am going to make dinner now, AFK ^v^
<junh1024-XD> oh, mb it's anamorphic 1.85>4:3 ?
<junh1024-XD> or whatever
<drf|laptop> 03I thought you just said panavision was 2.35
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeyas Arti
<junh1024-XD> panavision could make other AR cameras
<junh1024-XD> iduno
<drf|laptop> 03I guess I just don't get how anamorphic cameras work in general
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<drf|laptop> 03if it's normally 4:3, I get filming it as such and cropping it
<drf|laptop> 03but eh
<HyperMetalLugia> Kites are a type of bird
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
*HyperMetalLugia confuzzle

<drf|laptop> 03it's just, now I have Lifetime HD so I thought I'd watch Unsolved Mysteries on that
<drf|laptop> 03but it's stretched and I refuse to watch anything that's stretched
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really care too much for Avatar
<prince-dari> I don't either.
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't care
<HyperMetalLugia> >c.
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, it's not that I don't like it
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I don't see anything special about it
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<HyperMetalLugia> It's not that special?
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> So
<prince-dari> Plot was meh, and while I think the CGI was pretty good, I don't think it was AMAZING! MOSMAGOSDJAFIGOJS
<HyperMetalLugia> I never saw the blu-ray or 3D version
<HyperMetalLugia> Just SD on a small 16in CRT TV
<HyperMetalLugia> Using my Wii
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<prince-dari> I didn't see any 3D when I watched it 3D in the cinema.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've never watched a movie in 3D before
<Aurora|Exam> 6I liked avatar because of the graphics, and the creatures
<Angel_Espeon> 13so I dunno what it's like o-o
<Aurora|Exam> 6it wasn't the godsend of movies though
<HyperMetalLugia> My first 3D movie that I actually put on the glasses was the new pirates of the carribean :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Since they FILMED it in 3D
<Aurora|Exam> 6rio was actually somewhat decent in 3D, but i don't care for 3D really
<xxLatiosxx> 12I haven't even watched Avatar
<Angel_Espeon> 13I want to see Rio D:
<HyperMetalLugia> I never saw Rio
<Espeon> 06I really don't like 3d tbh ugh
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've seen half of Avatar LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Looked a bit too silly lol
<prince-dari> 3D as is now seems pretty poor.
<Aurora|Exam> 6rio was adorable
<xxLatiosxx> 12I just realised I'm really slow at watching new movies.
<Angel_Espeon> 13At someone's house, but left in the miffle of it

<xxLatiosxx> 12I only just watched Scott Pilgram vs the world yesterday
<prince-dari> Wasn't Rio the film based on angry birds? Or is that something else?
<Aurora|Exam> 6....lol this exam
<HyperMetalLugia> Angry birds had RIo characters in it
<HyperMetalLugia> Or a spinoff

<drf|laptop> 03the concept of that is just... ._.
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil :|
<Aurora> 6...

<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6did she say they died or something?
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03the one that was on Oprah, she didn't say anything, and that mom had been after the nurse forever saying she stole the baby
<drf|laptop> 03which she did
<Aurora> 6x.x
<drf|laptop> 03the other one, apparently the mother said she never wanted to give the baby up for adoption but the nurse tricked her into signing the form
<drf|laptop> 03and apparently the nurse traded a boat for that baby
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah that just sucks

<Lambda> :O
<Stormy> that gets rid of chanserv
<prince-dari> So?
<Stormy> so the channel will go away when everyone leaves
<prince-dari> That doesn't unregister the channel.
<Stormy> meaning it's not registered anymore
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Do it.
<prince-dari> We'll se.
<prince-dari> ..
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> see*
<Glacymr> 12lies
<Stormy> I wrote the tutorials for epic-chat

<prince-dari> It's just the guard.

<Stormy> No, but how did you check?
<prince-dari> Then when we both leave it'll still be here.
<prince-dari> Well, the topic.
<prince-dari> So you'll se it isn't unregistered.
<Stormy> OK, leave
<prince-dari> /part #blarg!
<Lambda> okay so if we all leave then come back
<prince-dari> He rejoins when the first person comes back in.
<prince-dari> Then leaves.

<Lambda> that's really weird
<Stormy> This is weird
<prince-dari> He comes back when the first person joins after no one has been in there.
<prince-dari> Then leaves immediately.
<prince-dari> She*
<Stormy> How do you get rid of a channel then?
<Lambda> how do you ever unregister one?
<prince-dari> Check the commands list. :P

<Stormy> And what does Guard mean if not what I thought?
<Ray> 02you?
<Lambda> This channel is now about PONIES <- Nice
<Kosoveon> pretty good~
<prince-dari> ChanServ protects the channel I suppose.
<prince-dari> So it's the guard setting.
<Lambda> but it sounds like if you turn guard off she still does
<Lambda> she just comes back when someone joins
<prince-dari> Comes back in to establish channel topic, and properties probably.
<prince-dari> Then leaves.
<prince-dari> So doesn't do anything to protect it.
<prince-dari> I was just doing it because it's funny to see ChanServ leave. :P

<Kitten> they're your parents they're supposed to be just so stupid in your opinion
<Jason> and not get in trouble
<Rurik> 4No I beat it
<Lambda> what game is this we speak of?
<Rurik> 4But replaying it on Critical mode
<Stormy> Cinderella? whut?
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> ummmm
<Rurik> 4and I have no idea ho wto get the dress peice on top of that wardrobe in the Wardrobe room
<RedDragonX> I remember that being a pain in the ass
<Lambda> Disney Princess Adventures?
<RedDragonX> you have to go through the corridors
<Jason> What is the point of life?
<Kitten> families irritate eachother its just a law of nature
<Lambda> oh, is it Kingdom Hearts?
<Rurik> 4fucking level 15 from running around trying to figure this crap out
<RedDragonX> their is an entrance to it
<RedDragonX> Kingdom Hearts yes
<RedDragonX> Birth By Sleep
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> Ah, okay
<Kitten> it varies with each individual
<Rurik> 4I've ran through the two corridors
<Rurik> 4one where cheese is stuck in the webs
<prince-dari> RDX plays some Disney sappy Kingdom Hearts game but whines when people post ponies? O___o...
<RedDragonX> it took me awhile to find it
<Rurik> 4and the other that leads to her room
<RedDragonX> their is another way
<Jason> no, I mean I actually want to kill him
<Stormy> Don't ask me
<Jason> just my dad
<Stormy> lol
<Rurik> 4the one that leads to her room has another passage but IT'S SUPER AMAZING HIGH UP
<Stormy> I thought you were supposed to be sleeping, though :O
<Jason> my mom I always regret the thought of afte r
<prince-dari> I'm revising. :P
<prince-dari> But also lurking.
<Stormy> Oh, hah
<Kitten> you know you don't know how lucky you are
<Jason> yeah I do
<RedDragonX> well
<Jason> I have money and blah blah blah
<RedDragonX> if you get totally lost just go over to the wiki and look it up lol
<Kitten> your wanting to get rid of the thing i've wanted most
<Jason> ok
<Lambda> DARI GET TO BED RIGHT NOW MISTER
<Lambda> jk
<Jason> You can take mine
<prince-dari> LOL
<RedDragonX> I haven't been in that section in awhile
<prince-dari> Yes sir. :'(
<Stormy> Lambda, you his mother or something?
<Stormy> :P
<Jason> I just want happiness in my like
<Jason> lie
<Jason> life*
<Lambda> I was pretending to be like one, yes
<RedDragonX> I'm too busy getting psyched up for KH3D
<Rurik> 4All of my D-Links have been upgraded
<Lambda> how tired are you dari?
<RedDragonX> you get all the finishers?
<Lambda> after that all nighter last night :P
<Rurik> 4Ja
<prince-dari> I slept from about 4 PM - 8 PM.
<Lambda> oh, nice thinking
<prince-dari> So not very
<Kitten> no cause it wouldn't be the same, my dad died when i was 3, i've wanted him back, and yet you want to kill yours.. that seems kinda selfish, but then again it also could be accounted with self preservation..
<Jason> :(
<RedDragonX> you unlock blank points? I forget the requirements
<Jason> Thats so sad?
<Jason> Thats so sad.
<prince-dari> Should say to RDX: Uhh DISNEY, YOU RUIN MY LIFE! I come back and it's a Disney world. FML I'm leaving.
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<Rurik> 4No I didn't get that one
<Rurik> 4Dats why I am doing it on Critical mode
<Rurik> 4I just have to beat the game
<prince-dari> Or is it just supposed to be love and tolerance?
<RedDragonX> you shouldn't have to do it on critical mode
<Rurik> 4So far its pretty cake
<Aristeo> Jason: stfu
<Aristeo> seriously
<RedDragonX> excepet for the challenge
*Kitten shakes her head trust me, whenever your dad does die, if it's before you do.. you'll miss him and want him back..
<RedDragonX> you can unlock it on proud mode
<Lambda> is what supposed to be love and tolerance?
<Rurik> 4I WANT IT IN CRITICAL MODE
<Rurik> 4DAMN IT
<prince-dari> Of everything.
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I think so
<RedDragonX> lol
<Jason> I didnt mean to put the question mark there, that was a mistake
<Jason> then I fixed it on the line after
<Lambda> even parasprites
<Jason> but I mean
<Lambda> we should even love them
<RedDragonX> good luck beating the Lingering Sentimet in Critical
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Jason> How do I make him just shut up and tell him everything he does pisses me off
<Jason> ?
<Lambda> That was a good one
<Lambda> (when am I NOT gonna say that after reflecting on an episode I just watched?)
<Stormy> Which one are you on now?
<Lambda> umm
<Lambda> just watched the parasprite one last night
<Lambda> I'll look up the next one
<Lambda> just a sec
<Aristeo> Hey Curly :)
<Lambda> Call of the Cutie
<Lambda> this sounds epic
<Rurik> 4Wow
<Rurik> 4I'm a fucking idiot
<Rurik> 4On episode 13
<prince-dari> You're telling me?
<prince-dari> TROLOLO!
<Lambda> 12
<prince-dari> Haha, Rurik overtook you.
<Lambda> you've gotten ahead of me
<Stormy> o.o
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Stormy> Nyan
<Lambda> oh wait
<Lambda> I was wrong
<Neon> I've fallen out of favor. :/
<Lambda> I'm on 11
<Lambda> the winter one
<Stormy> That's one of the best ones
<prince-dari> With?
<Lambda> "The whole town of Ponyville is gathering to bring an end to winter"
<Lambda> bring an end to winter?
<Lambda> it started?
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> Oh, yay!
<Stormy> Yeah, suddenly it's been winter for months
<Stormy> when there hasn't been one winter episode so far
<Neon> This ragtag group of bronies, of course.
<Lambda> hey Nyan
<Stormy> Shhh! You'll make RDX mad
<Lambda> no you haven't
<Rurik> 4Shhh
<prince-dari> You can be our resident venom pony.
<Lambda> you're still high up in my ranks of respect at least
<Rurik> 4This is a story about different ponies with random adventures
<Rurik> 4and this is your biggest concern?
*Neon halfheartedly fist pumps.
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> yep
<Stormy> Nah, not a concern
<Lambda> oh hey speaking of Nyan
<Neon> Nah, but really. Either my jokes have gone stale or your opinion of me has changed.
<Stormy> What do you mean?
<prince-dari> ...
<Lambda> in the wikipedia article about cat's meows, it listed all the different anomotopeas of it, and Nyan was one
<prince-dari> Neon's going to go on a rant too?
<prince-dari> NOBODY LOVES ME ANYMORE!
<Lambda> wait, what do you mean Neon?
<prince-dari> NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME!
<Neon> No rants, haha.
<Rurik> 4Emo
<Stormy> Dari you be quiet and get back to your chemistry
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> :P
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> Yes ma'am.
<Neon> Just an observation I felt the need to bring up.
<Lambda> if I ever don't laugh at your jokes it's usually because I don't know the reference
<Rurik> 4I love the top comment for episode 12 though
<Lambda> usually when I do get them I find them hilarious
<Rurik> 4"I can't help but think that this episode﻿ is implicitly about a girl waiting to get her first period."
*Neon shrugs.
<Stormy> I usually don't get 75% of the references anyway, so...
<Neon> Maybe that's it, then. Whatever, I'm regretting even bringing it up.
<Stormy> hah
<prince-dari> I think I'd know if I didn't find you funny.
<prince-dari> And I do.
<prince-dari> ...There's not much more to say. :P
<Lambda> Haha
<Neon> Mhm. This is just poor self-esteem talking, methinsk.
<Neon> *methinks
<Neon> Forget I said anything.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Gah.
<Lambda> choke on something?
<Lambda> :P

<Rurik> 4Cupcakes anyone?
<prince-dari> /notice Neon I don't see how anything's changed, still trolling people; Brock rapes Ash in pokemon, remember? :P
<Rurik> 4http://e621.net/data/2b/64/2b6479ff05463e791e46de448d5e809d.png
<prince-dari> /notice Neon Heheheh.
<Neon> I wish I could say I was trolling people right now. :/ But yeah, that was hilarious.
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> the horror!
<Lambda> THE HORROR!
<Neon> It's the meat-aball!
<Neon> http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/8R3dpx/www.collegehumor.com/article/6057002/status-updates-from-old-friends-circa-the-90s
<prince-dari> /notice Neon That was a recent ocurrence, what makes you think anything's changed?
<Lambda> Hahahahaha
<Lambda> oh nostalgia
<prince-dari> XD Yeah.
<prince-dari> Been so long since I've seen that show. Haha.
<Lambda> Haha, I like the waldo and Carmen Sandiego part
<Rurik> 4haha yeah
<Neon> For some reason that alone isn't good enough. It needs to be constant lulz, or I go through withdrawals
<Rurik> 4LMAO CAPTAIN PLANET
*Lambda never watched it
<Rurik> 4No
<Rurik> 4Just love the Bruce Banner part
<Neon> Aaaand, this inevitably leads to Star Wars, so: http://www.collegehumor.com/article/6457509/star-wars-psas
<prince-dari> LOL "If you don't know who your father is, anyone could be your sister".
<Rurik> 4hahaha
<Rurik> 4That's so true
<Rurik> 4Stormy
<Rurik> 4You enjoy it
<Stormy> what?
<prince-dari> Stormy: We ate the 'strawberry cheescake' cupcake cake.
<prince-dari> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<prince-dari> D:
<Stormy> haha
<Lugianite> hola!
<Rurik> 4Mmm
<Rurik> 4I found a peice of rainbow hair
<Rurik> 4Prolly nothing
<Stormy> I think I just went back in time 5 years
<Stormy> because my dad is treating me like I'm 15
<Lambda> XD
<Rurik> 4Oh?
<Stormy> He sends me a message saying "I hope you got permission to use someone else's network"
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Stormy> I haven't touched my network settings and haven't even attempted to connect to a neighbor's
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02z-z
<Rurik> 4Message him back saying "Dad, I never ask."
<Stormy> I go upstairs and ask if he's sure that message was meant for me
<Stormy> He says "Well, you're online, and I don't see you on my network"
<Stormy> I go and check my computer
<Stormy> It's connected to our network
<Stormy> I bring it upstairs and show it to my dad
<Stormy> "Oh. My mistake then."
<Rurik> 4No kidding
<Stormy> Seriously
<Stormy> first opportunity I get
<Stormy> I am out of here
<Rurik> 4Why is everyone I know havign family issues?
<Stormy> I already put up with his shit idea of blocking the internet at midnight and blocking sites I use
<RedDragonX> I'm not having family issues
<Neon> I killed and ate my family last night. So no issues for me. :D
<Lambda> haha
<Rurik> 4Well, except for you and Neon
<Lambda> that... works
<Stormy> And now he's accusing me of lying and leeching off neighbors' internet on top of that
<Neon> Actuallt, that's not entirely true.
<Rurik> 4Overprotective dads ftl
<Stormy> But yeah, not really family issues, at least not compared to what some people go through
<Neon> I threw my sister outside so the birds could take a crack at her.
<Neon> They need to eat, too.
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> Mine's just an annoyance
<Rurik> 4My mom used to be like that
<Stormy> My mom did too
<Rurik> 4Back when I was young and retarded, I used to read fanfiction
<Stormy> then she realized I'm 20 years old
<Rurik> 4My mom booted me off and proofread it
<Lambda> my family's good now too
<Lambda> but only because they have no clue how to kick me off the internet late at night
<Rurik> 4She even went through my music and was deleting shit that may be offensive
<Lambda> O.o
<Lambda> wow
<Rurik> 4Till I eventually verbally smacke dher
<Stormy> wow
<HyperetalLugia> Heya Lugianite :3
<Stormy> That's even worse that some of the stuff my parents did
<Rurik> 4Mostly becuase I got the music back in a nanosecond
<Rurik> 4And I read fanfiction without anyone noticing
<Rurik> 4Cuz I was amazing
<Rurik> 4Eventually mom said 'fuck it'
<Rurik> 4Dad never really cared...
<Rurik> 4Let me do what i want
<Stormy> But it was my parents they would have just blocked everything with the word "fanfiction" or anything relating to the fandom I was reading fanfics for
<Neon> Why'd you have to feed him to snakes?
<Lambda> Who said that?
<Rurik> 4Yeah
<Neon> Boris said it.
<Rurik> 4But I knew my way around it
<Lambda> ah, Boris
<Stormy> I would use proxies
<Neon> No, he doesn't even think that.
*Lambda arrests Boris
<Neon> I'm not defending him!
<Stormy> but not too often because they'd find out about those too
<Neon> I'm just saying there wasn't any malice toward you or her.
<Rurik> 4Yeah. I had severe depression issues back then
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Neon> Well, you can think that then, Boris. I'm done with this conversation.
<Stormy> Same here, actually
<Rurik> 4Like I would sit alone in my room, lights off, reading fanfiction with emo music playing
<Rurik> 4I was super pale
<Lambda> in my depressed days my mom was like the only person I ever spoke to
<Rurik> 4I never spoke to anyon
<Stormy> I spoke to people on the internet
<Neon> I didn't talk to anyone. The Internet wouldn't judge me.
<Stormy> And my brother
<Rurik> 4that was too mainstream
<Rurik> 4I mean
<Rurik> 4I almost cut my forehead before
<Rurik> 4purposely
*Lambda goes back in time and gives emo-Rurik huge glasses
<Lambda> ouch, good thing you didn't
<Rurik> 4To make it seem like I was Harry Potter
<Rurik> 4I was retarded
<Stormy> o.o wait, really?
<Rurik> 4Yeah
<Neon> That would b worth it.
<Neon> *be
<Rurik> 4It would lol
<Lambda> imagine how people would react
<Rurik> 4I remember I tried doing it with my fingernails in class
<Lambda> wouldn't be too hard to start conversations with strangers, on the bright side
<Rurik> 4People thought I was doing an L
<Neon> You walk into school: "Some creepy wizard tried to kill me, nbd."
<Lambda> haha
<Rurik> 4haha yeah
<Lambda> he didn't even have a nose!
<Lambda> Freak!
<Rurik> 4I dunno what brought me out of depression
<Lambda> me neither
<Stormy> lol
<Rurik> 4But I was always depressed until this past year
<Neon> I cut off his nose after he did it.
<Lambda> but I'm glad I'm out of it
<Rurik> 4Then I was like
<Rurik> 4'Fuck this dark emo shit I have been writing."
<Neon> Mine's chronic, but it remisses at intervals.
<Rurik> 4aaand made this: http://rurikredwolf.deviantart.com/art/The-Giant-Squid-208076748
<Rurik> 4 600 words
<Rurik> 4but 600 words of amazingness
<prince-dari> Damn, I'm just about the only person here who's never had any problems with anything.
<Stormy> For me, honestly
<prince-dari> Hahahahaha.
<Lambda> Haha, you're lucky
<Stormy> It was probably when I stopped talking to SR
<Stormy> hah
<Rurik> 4HAHAHA
<Stormy> everything's his fault, lol
<RedDragonX> I'm talking to him right now
<Neon> Dari: Well, quiet desparation is the English way, right?
<Rurik> 4Red
<Lugianite> hi
<Rurik> 4Tell him everytrhing is his fault
<prince-dari> Although when I was younger I cut myself because I thought it was cool.
<Stormy> RedDragonX, be careful or he might make you depressed
<RedDragonX> sure if you want
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> /FAIL
<Rurik> 4Gas prices included
<RedDragonX> psst
<RedDragonX> he's too busy making himself rich
<Lambda> that's HIS fault?!
<Neon> I'm not willing to disclose what I did. It was far too stupid.
*Lambda punches SR in the nose
<HyperMetalLugia> There we go lol
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Rurik> 4Neon
<prince-dari> Good thing I grew up.
<Rurik> 4It's not as bad as reading Inuyasha fanfics
<Rurik> 4I can tell ya that now
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> I can only imagine
<Lambda> [21:53] <+prince-dari> Good thing I grew up. <- I'm really sorry dari, but that made me laugh a bit
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> You'd be surprised. :P
<prince-dari> ...LOL
<prince-dari> Well, you know what I mean.
<Rurik> 4Like
<Lambda> yeah I do
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> Dari, are you 14 or 15?
<Lambda> you just have an inner child
<Rurik> 4I can remember in one there was a surprise sex scene
<Lambda> as do I
<prince-dari> 15.
<Stormy> Ah
<Lambda> and I love that part of me
<Rurik> 4I think I reached puberty at that moment
<Lambda> makes life fun
<Neon> LOL
<prince-dari> HAHAHAHA
<Rurik> 4:D
<Stormy> And RedDragonX, don't forget to ask SR about the forum
<Lambda> what about it?
<Stormy> If you haven't already
<Lambda> buying it?
<Stormy> To see if we can get someone in charge who will actually do stuff
<Neon> SR is clearly depressed because he doesn't have the Matter Destroyer app.
<Lambda> XDDDD
<Lambda> oh god
<prince-dari> LOL
<Lambda> that was so funny
<Stormy> XD
<RedDragonX> I'm trying to format how to ask him about it
<Rurik> 4hahahaha
<Stormy> Oh yeah, guys
<Neon> Take that, Newton.
<Rurik> 4REd
<Rurik> 4Just be like
<Lambda> :P
<Rurik> 4"Bitch, take care of your site or let me do it."
<Stormy> Remember the "letter" Lambda wrote to SR
<Stormy> ?
<Lambda> Neon, I drew all of us as stick figures once
<prince-dari> Oh yeah. XD
<Rurik> 4No
<Neon> Yes, which he should've sent!

<prince-dari> Haaaah, that was brilliant.
<Rurik> 4Tell me now
<Neon> SAY WUUUUUT
<Stormy> I wrote a reply
<Stormy> As him
<Neon> Where's the evidence?
<Stormy> it was hilarious
<Lambda> you were holding an android phone that said "That this, Newton!" on the screen
<Rurik> 4STORMY
<Rurik> 4TELL ME
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Stormy> Hmmmm
<Stormy> maybe
<Rurik> 4I must laugh before I go to bed
<Lambda> I have the original
<Lambda> you can read mine if you'd like
<Neon> Rurik: Penis

<Lambda> :P
<Rurik> 4under scraps
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> Not penis.
<Lambda> good
<Stormy> nah he probably stalks my deviantart
<prince-dari> PINGAS!
<Lambda> hmm
<Stormy> cause he's a creeper and all
<Neon> Eh, upload it to imageshack where the link will disappear soon enough.
<Rurik> 4send em to me via e-mail
<Stormy> Hmm
<Lambda> what's your email?
<Stormy> Sure
<Stormy> Oh, actually
<prince-dari> Neon: You should join the laser forum, then send SR a PM saying "Are you from my forum?"
<Stormy> My photobucket account is private
<Rurik> 4Rurikredwolf @ yahoo
<Neon> XxxdarkfrozenfingersxxX@lifeisvoid.com
<Stormy> So I'll screenshot and upload it there
<Stormy> LOL Neon
<Rurik> 4LOL
<Lambda> XD
<Rurik> 4Neon I wouldn't put it past you
<Lugianite> :P
<Neon> I'm going to create that domain now.
<Neon> http://lifeisvoid.com
<Rurik> 4Do it
<prince-dari> LOL. Worth it.
<Rurik> 4I'll join
<Neon> I will if I remember.
<Neon> Dari: I just might.
<Lambda> Rurik: sent it.
<prince-dari> Cupcakes? D: FLEE! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130626872839.gif
<Neon> Lambda, did I tell you about that awkward moment where I found Terra on Facebook coincidentally?
<Lambda> Hahaha, no
<Lambda> do tell
<Stormy> Who's Terra?
<Lambda> a newer OFF member
<Lambda> she or he?
<Rurik> 4Who?
<Rurik> 4What?
<Rurik> 4OFF?
<Lambda> I can never keep track
<Neon> Well, I joined this Guardians of Ga'Hool group like 3 and a half years ago, and just yesterday it was brought to my attention again because the group creator updated it.
<Neon> Terra's a she, the one with the animated avatar of the guitar guy.
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> he's a Scott Pilgrim character
<Lambda> her avatar
<Lambda> and she has Deadpool and Harley Quinn in her sig
<Rurik> 4Lambda
<Lambda> yeah?
<Rurik> 4I enjoyed that there message
<Neon> Anyway, I saw her there, commenting on one of the things. I only noticed that comment afterward, and she responded to something I said, but didn't have any idea it was me.
<Rurik> 4Send it
<prince-dari> WOMEN? ON INTERNET? LIE! Which means Lambda and Stormy are clearly a closet gay couple.
<Lambda> thanks :P
<Lambda> we are not
<Rurik> 4Yet
<Lambda> Stormy is all woman
<Neon> I by myself am a closet gay couple.
<Stormy> HOW DARE YOU I AM SO OFFENDED NO- oh wait
<Rurik> 4:P
<prince-dari> Neon: ...O__o Impressive.
<Lambda> the "thanks" was directed at Rurik
<Neon> I and I am afraid that society won't approve of our orientation.
<Neon> So I and I stay quiet about it.
<Lambda> Hahaha, nice Neon, she never knew it was you?
<Stormy> Btw I uploaded the letter
<Rurik> 4Minnisota is voting against gay marriage now
<Stormy> PM me if you want it
<Neon> Nope. I was considering making her upset but decided against it.
<Neon> Queen of the TL;DR posts, Scourge's Daughter, is at it again... -_-
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Not a picture of ponies BTW: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130629244383.jpg
<Rurik> 4LOL
<Rurik> 4WTF
<Neon> LOL
<Lambda> wtf
<Lambda> only you dari :P
<prince-dari> Hahahaha.
<Rurik> 4I am so saving that picture
<Stormy> o_o
<Stormy> why?! XD
<Rurik> 4It's amazing
<Rurik> 4That's why
<Stormy> If you say so :P
<Neon> Reminds me of an oldy but a goodie: http://romston.com/wp-posts/11-01-09-Sarah_Palin_brainless_invisible_dicks/Sarah_Palin_brainless_invisible_dicks_Img01.png
<Rurik> 4If I could
<Rurik> 4I would have that as my SF avatar
<Neon> SF still exists? D:
<Stormy> No
<Lambda> it does
<Lambda> I have begun going back
<Stormy> It's a hallucination
<Stormy> Right dari?
<Lambda> like RDX?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> Exactly
<Rurik> 4Yeah
<Lambda> the rest of us are all real, right?
<Stormy> We're all real
<Lambda> I know (*THINK D: ) I'm real
<Stormy> except RDX and you
<Lambda> wait
<Lambda> why me?
<Stormy> Because you asked
<Stormy> Of course
<Lambda> I've been here all along
<Neon> Am I real?
<RedDragonX> huh what?
<Lambda> ohhh
<RedDragonX> I'm a hallucination
<Neon> I should pinch myself to be sure.
<Lambda> No Neon
<RedDragonX> I'm not here
<Neon> Oooh, that feels good.
<Lambda> you are a hallucinatipm
<Lambda> errr
<Neon> I'm going to continue.
<Lambda> *hallucination
<Rurik> 4Ok
<Rurik> 4I am gonna go to bed
<Lambda> you do that
<Rurik> 4I have to get up in the morning
<Lambda> See ya Rurik
<Rurik> 4One more week of school
<Lambda> oh nice
<Stormy> See ya
<Lambda> then freedom!
<Neon> Bye, Rurik.
*Lambda does a William Wallace cheer
<Neon> One thing before you go.
<Lambda> WAR
<Neon> WAR
<Rurik> 4Then life buttfucking me
<Rurik> 4Like SR and Red
<Lambda> XD what a classy exit
<Neon> One more week? He should count his blessings!
<Stormy> o.o he's going to get punched for that next time he's here
<Neon> I'm in pris -- school until the 21st of June. :/
<Stormy> Ouch
<Lambda> what're ya in fer?
<Neon> Domestic violence.
<Lambda> oh right
<Lambda> the eating them all thing
<Neon> Who knew cannibalism homicide was illegal?
*Lambda shrugs
<Neon> I sure didn't.
<RedDragonX> why am I the evil one?
<Lambda> I forgot to give dari credit for his part of the letter
<Stormy> ?
<Lambda> no idea
<Neon> New wallpaper: check.
<Lambda> what Rurik said?
<Lambda> you mean?
<Neon> Lawn duties completed: check.
<Neon> Solve world hunger: check
<Neon> Tell no one...
<Lambda> None shall know of it my lord
<Lambda> not even I
<Lambda> for I am already oblivious

<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Stormy> You've been watching too many movies
<Neon> Good. Perhaps your usefulness hasn't yet completed its course.
<Lambda> I actually haven't really been watching any lately
<Neon> NO. SUCH. THING.

<Neon> xP
<Neon> Anyone care to watch Barowl either get really butthurt or laugh?
<Stormy> :O
<Neon> While we wait, an amusing image from our sponsors.
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> is it happening on OFF?
<Neon> http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/227102_10150187167908492_559688491_7126680_7897171_n.jpg
<Neon> Yes. I'm just waiting for his response. He's already angry with me for disagreeing with him in the philosophy thread.
<RedDragonX> yeah he has no plans to develop the forum any further
<RedDragonX> nor does he want to
<Stormy> Big surprise
<RedDragonX> no financial opportunity in it
<Stormy> Was he at least open to letting someone else do it?
<RedDragonX> nope
<Neon> BO needs to make his move before I get him in check.
<Lambda> holy crap scourge's post really is TL;DR
<Neon> I didn't even attempt it.
<Lambda> same
<Neon> I mean, I have some fairly lengthy posts in one topic, but it's so I could adress every side of the argument.
<Neon> She just likes to type.
<Lambda> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya LL
<HyperMetalLugia> And goodbye LL :P
<Neon> Wild Barowl fled!
<Quilava> hmn..
*Neon sighs.
<RedDragonX> he did say that if anyone can come up with a good design that he likes he might consider changing it
<Stormy> Well good luck impressing Mr. Master Web Designer
<Stormy> heh
<Lambda> I remember him saying to Jason last week
<Lambda> "I don't desing, I do the back end stuff"
<Lambda> *design
<Stormy> well yeah, but have you seen the pages he's made?
<RedDragonX> but as for the mod settings and him not being around the answer is "you guys can more then handle it"
<Stormy> wow
<Stormy> Yeah, we can totally handle activating people's accounts and adding people to groups, which we don't even have the rights to do
<Stormy> Makes perfect sense
<Stormy> He could at least take those features off if he's not going to be around to manage them
<Neon> I say you convert the forum into a brothel.
<Neon> It's already on its way.
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> Baaaaad idea :P
<Neon> C'mon. There's your financial viability.
<Stormy> we already have myspace for that
<RedDragonX> I'll see if I can convince him to alter permissions
<Neon> Another zinger from Stormy.
<Stormy> :P
<Neon> Okay, the name of this article alone is funny: Brisk Walking Helps Prostate Patients.
<Umbreon> 12nom
<Neon> I don't even need to read it.
<RedDragonX> yay a got him to do something
<RedDragonX> now let's see if he does it
<Stormy> What is he doing?
<RedDragonX> supposedly giving us permissions to activate users and add to grpus
<RedDragonX> "groups"
<Stormy> Ah
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> I doubt it'll happen
<Stormy> 15% chance he actually does it
<RedDragonX> yep
<Stormy> oh hey
<RedDragonX> but yeah as for anything else it has no financial gain and as of such it is of no relative importance to him
<Stormy> he did something
<Stormy> I just got added to the fanfiction usergroup
<Neon> Woah, I just got demoted to a group called "Possible Forum Members."
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> He's still not sure if you're from his forum?
<Neon> Oh, I have no idea. I was just kidding.
<Neon> I haven't even talked to the guy about it since he said those infamous words.
<RedDragonX> yeah he says we can add users to groups now
<Lambda> Neon: other than all the times you've mocked him for it
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> that was so funny though
<Neon> Yeah, but he never really responded.
<Lambda> he has me in the group "Who the hell is THIS guy?"
<Neon> LOL
<Stormy> That would be every member
<Lambda> LOL true
<Stormy> Except me, RDX, and Aicebo
<Stormy> Oh, and probably LoneKnight
<Neon> Owlpages still hasn't wirtten back.
<Stormy> inb4 Stormknight
<RedDragonX> lol I forgot all about him
<Neon> My memory is foggy, but wasn't there also someone literally named Spyro?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> He was the first mod
<Stormy> Who HAS A LIFE
<RedDragonX> Who Neal?
<RedDragonX> lol
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Stormy> That's like
<RedDragonX> that guy is a freaking tool
<Stormy> All he ever talked about
<Lambda> my first ever post on SF was correcting him
<Stormy> I'M LATE BECAUSE I HAVE A LIFE YOU'RE ALL SO UNGRATEFUL
<Lambda> for saying "anyways"
<Neon> I'M SORRY BUT YOU ALL CAN'T EXPECT ME TO COMPETENTLY DO MY JOB AS A MODERATOR WHEN I HAVE AN AUSPICIOUS TRACK MEET TO ATTEND.

<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> Yo!
<Mikey> hi
<Stormy> Hey
<Neon> Hey, hey, hey.
<Neon> It's Faaaaaat Albert.
<RedDragonX> but yeah he still wont give the fucking thing up to somebody else
<RedDragonX> stubborn bastard
<Stormy> Why the hell not?
<Stormy> He clearly doesn't care about it
<Lambda> @pony
<Steve> 12Lambda is 15Tw6i4st
<Stormy> Makes no sense
<RedDragonX> because it doesn't need to be under new ownership
<RedDragonX> that's the only reason he needs
<Stormy> Well
<Mikey> what's up?
<Stormy> I have to disagree with him on that one
<RedDragonX> it's quite simple
<Neon> Big people business. Wanna go play darts?
<RedDragonX> if it doesn't involve money then it doesn't interest him
<RedDragonX> why he keeps it then
<RedDragonX> I don't know
<Stormy> Mikey: RDX was trying to convince SR to let someone else take over the forum
<RedDragonX> too prideful to give it away prolly
<Lambda> ooh, darts
<Lambda> I'm in!
*Neon scampers off.
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> nobody wants to play darts with me *sniff*
<Neon> *scampers off with Lambda in tow
<Stormy> Seriously
<Stormy> If it wouldn't be awkward as hell for me to talk to him
<Stormy> I'd ask him myself how much he'd sell it for
<RedDragonX> oh yeah
<Neon> Oooh, let me do it. He doesn't even know me, apparently.
<RedDragonX> he also says "Don't be afraid to come talk to me"
<RedDragonX> as usual
<Neon> I'll just be an anonymous messenger.
<Stormy> What, he says that to me?
<Stormy> Or you
<RedDragonX> about all of us
<Stormy> oh
<Stormy> dude
<Stormy> we don't talk to you because you don't give a crap what we have to say
<RedDragonX> unless it involves money
<Neon> And you're Canadian.
<RedDragonX> and for forum growth
<RedDragonX> his answer is
<Neon> Make sure to involve that he's Canadian.
<Stormy> yeah, and since we don't have the buckets of money he needs to be interested
<RedDragonX> "forums grow by members inviting more people."
<Stormy> Nothing will ever happen
<Stormy> Well that's true
<Stormy> But that's not the only way
<RedDragonX> not so uch in this case
<RedDragonX> this is a forum based upon a franchise
<Stormy> If everything else about the forum sucks, no one will stay
<RedDragonX> it runs more on just popularity then friends inviting each other
<Stormy> Speaking of forums
<Stormy> I have half a mind to start an MLP forum
<Stormy> I've always wanted my own forum
<RedDragonX> or whatever little popularity is left in Spyro
<Stormy> this could be the official channel or whatever
*Neon throws a dart at RDX by accident.
<Stormy> I don't understand why he would continue to pay for hosting if it's so insignificant to him
<RedDragonX> ouch
<RedDragonX> idk
<Stormy> probably doesn't even notice however much it costs disappearing every month, though
<Lambda> That could be the forum you and I have been meaning to start for over a year now :D
<RedDragonX> you'll never get a straight answer out of him
<RedDragonX> but it's quite simply just his pride
<RedDragonX> he wont ever give up something that HE owns or created
<Lambda> Neon: le GASP!
<Neon> Le seriously.
<Lambda> there will be repercussions (sp?) for such an act!
<RedDragonX> anything other then what is his is a travesty
<Neon> Slap the nucka widda pan. All's your problems are solved.
*Neon slaps SR widda pan, solving all's the problems.
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Stormy> lol
<Lambda> Peels here!
<RedDragonX> oh well
*Lambda solves more problems
<Stormy> it's like
<RedDragonX> I'm proud of myself I got him to change ONE thing
<RedDragonX> YAY
<Neon> I know one thing.
<Stormy> we've talked about this so many times
<Neon> I'm grabbin' peeels.
<Stormy> and every time
<Stormy> I come out thinking "Why do I even care?"
<Neon> Because deep down you have an eternal flame of love for Sr, of course.
<Neon> *SR
<Lambda> Senior
<Stormy> For Sr, maybe
<RedDragonX> your'e playing with fire buddy
<Stormy> For SR, no
<Lambda> who's Sr?
<Neon> Eternal flame of love for a Senior citizen.
<Stormy> Lambda, I have no clue
<Lambda> my nickname is not Senior
<Lambda> :P
<Neon> You're missing the point. >.<
*Mikey listens to the crowd OOOOOOOOH
<Lambda> OOHHH AH OH OH OH OH AH
<Neon> Now you've driven me to use stupid faces.
<Mikey> MUUUUUUFFINSSSSS
<Neon> I will avenge.
<Mikey> brb
<Lambda> o.=.o
<Lambda> like this?

<Stormy> You're a dwaggie
<Lambda> Mikey: bring me some muffins too
<Neon> no im nooottttttttt

<Lambda> what other auto ignores are there for dari?
*Neon slaps stormy widda pan

<Lambda> kawaii! <3
<RedDragonX> oh and he put the previous owner of SFA in charge of the wiki

<Lambda> o my gawsh ur volteer!!!!
<Neon> YES
<Neon> now u understahns
<Stormy> Why?
<Lambda> i will bow down 2 u nao
<Stormy> I thought he didn't care
<Neon> no need for dat
<RedDragonX> so he can "revive" it
<RedDragonX> or so he says
<Stormy> but
<Neon> all i need is cyndur
<Lambda> o i srry
<Stormy> why does he care about that

<Neon> Shoot, I should be asleep.
<Lambda> Ok, I'm gonna stop talking like that now
<Neon> But I'm still enteratained...
<Neon> *entertained
<Lambda> ok fain
<RedDragonX> he is sick of some of the members who post on it though
<Lambda> ill keep dooin it
<Stormy> I don't blame him for that
<Neon> nga plz
<Neon> i dont need U
<Stormy> I'm sick of pretty much everyone on there
<RedDragonX> yeah
<Stormy> Which again begs the question
<Stormy> "Why do I care?"
<Lambda> everyone who isn't here right now
<Neon> But with respectable members like Clock-la it's worth staying for.
<Lambda> XD NEON
<RedDragonX> because we are all that is left of what was once a very good userbase?
<Lambda> unless you;re serious
<Neon> Hardly. xD
<Stormy> How about this
<Stormy> Screw SF
<Stormy> And we'll start another forum somewhere else
<Stormy> There's our userbase
<Stormy> :D
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> can I be part?
<Stormy> NO
<Neon> Eh, not a viable option. Migrations never go well.
<Lambda> D':
<Stormy> Not a Spyro forum though
<Lambda> Neon, we will force you if we have to
<Lambda> throw you in our trunk
<RedDragonX> as long as it's not about ponies I'm ffine

<Stormy> What's a common interest we all have?
<Lambda> Um,
<Stormy> Besides Spyro
<Lambda> You got me there
<Lambda> video games
<Lambda> but that's too general
<Stormy> eh
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> Too many of those already
<Neon> The Internetz
<Lambda> we all have slightly different tastes
<Stormy> A forum about the internetz
<Stormy> interesting
<Lambda> haha
<Stormy> :P
<Neon> It's brilliant.
<Stormy> Oh, a forum about forums
<Lambda> isn't that basically what Reddit is?
<Stormy> Forumception?
<Neon> Pretty much.
<Neon> We'll make a site like that.
<Neon> Except we
<Lambda> Forumception
<Lambda> nice
<Lambda> dude
<Neon> *Except we'll call it "Breadit"
<Neon> And it'll be about bread.

<Neon> I used to hate him.
<Lambda> yeah, he has

<RedDragonX> that they do
<Lambda> Everywhere I go from coast to coast
<Lambda> people always ask me what I like the most
<Lambda> I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
<Lambda> I just tell 'em: I like toast
<RedDragonX> so yeah
<RedDragonX> phyrric victory I suppose
<Lambda> phyrric?
<RedDragonX> yes
<Lambda> what does that mean?
<RedDragonX> read up on your history :P
<Stormy> Ohh
<RedDragonX> A Phyric victory is when a winners losses are more then his gains
<Lambda> "A Pyrrhic victory ( /p?r?k/) is a victory with devastating cost to the victor; it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately cause defeat."
<Stormy> History nerd being told to read up on history
<Lambda> this isn't the history I read :P
<RedDragonX> too bad I can't spell it
<Lambda> history is very vast
<RedDragonX> anyways least I got him to change something
<Lambda> I only know bits of it
<RedDragonX> now I guess you have to start working on a design :P
<Stormy> Me?
<Stormy> Hell no
<RedDragonX> anyone lol
<Stormy> Unless he pays me
<RedDragonX> I sure as hell cant
*Lambda never designed a forum before
<Lambda> I wonder if I even know how without using bad practices
<Stormy> No
<RedDragonX> christ at least change the background for once
<Stormy> I can guarantee you that you don't
<Lambda> ok, I won't even try then
<Stormy> If you're talking about writing the code, at least
<RedDragonX> or the BOXING DAY image
<Lambda> no, I just mean the layout
<Stormy> oh
<Stormy> then maybe
<Stormy> but
<Lambda> like deciding what looks acceptable
<Lambda> not the actually coding
<Stormy> I'm sure SR wouldn't accept just an image of what it should look like
<Stormy> He'd want code
<Stormy> Or he'd be forced to spend time on it himself
<Lambda> yeah, and I have little to no web design experience
<RedDragonX> "If someone creates a professional design that is not done in mspaint and I like it, I will attempt to change the design."
<Stormy> What if it's done in MSpaint and it's good?
<Stormy> :P
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> I just want to make a troll design in MS paint now
<Stormy> Hahaha
<Lambda> something that lloks like a 4 year old did it
<Lambda> and PM it to him
<Stormy> change all the forum icons to a troll face
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> make spyro but with a purple forever alone face
<Stormy> Wait
<Stormy> but he said he will "attempt" to change it
<Stormy> he might attempt for five minutes
<Stormy> and then get bored
<Stormy> leaving it worse than before
<Lambda> heh, yeah

<Iskierka> if people have turned on highlights, that usually implies they had a reason for doing so.

<prince-dari> Fail.
<prince-dari> Complete and utter fail.
<Mikey> XD
<Lambda> wait, what did she mean by that?
<prince-dari> That I'd never get into a show like that.
