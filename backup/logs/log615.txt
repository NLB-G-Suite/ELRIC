<Gold_Demona> To be fair, he WAS warned... A lot
<DoublePint> Ban hammer?
<soulrider95> Thanks
<MadSurge> Wrek: perfect logic if you ask me
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Oh and claiming to have made one of the drawings he linked and his brother the with the other
<cowvarkian> no problem
<CCCP> Wrek he might of been joking?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: what is this "joke" you speak of
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: still saved the AJ pic :D
<Spectrum_Rush> thank you Wrek its good to be able to use my nick without getting confused for that guy
<CCCP> or exaggerating
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: That's still no excuse.
<alexxm> picture is definatly looking good
<vCades> lol nice
<Chrysalis> CCCP he was given ample time to show why he shouldnt be banned
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even if he was joking, it was in bad taste.
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0g93FEuCFuB
<MadSurge> ^
<Bronysith> oh shit
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yep but it's just stupid and being a douche taking credit or giving someone credit that did not make the drawings
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Acting like he's proud of being a rule breaker.
<CCCP> i honestly dont know why he was banned though :C
<CCCP> Chrysalis neither can i
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: no doubt about it
<Gold_Demona> CCCP: Because he was breaking rules on purpose and refused to stop
<Spectrum_Rush> it is good day =D
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: IKR?
<Ponies47> I told him to read the rules
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmmm
<Gold_Demona> CCCP: He was warned multiple times, and he persisted anyway
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64!
<CCCP> mourns Spectrum_Speed
*Chrysalis hugs SuperBrony64
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64 and Chrysalis
<cowvarkian> ohai sb
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT goes to the end of the chat chasing a tumbleweed
<shibaru> I didn't cry this time
<cowvarkian> I guess
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: So in my eyes with the attitude and how he tried taking credit for art he did not make, Seems like a pretty good reason for ban
<MadSurge> Ohey SuperBrony64 :D
<Gold_Demona> Hi SuperBrony64
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SuperBrony64!
<CCCP> Gold_Demona yeah so have 100's of other people here

<CCCP> that are still here
<cowvarkian> like me
<Gold_Demona> CCCP: Also what killerpony7733 said

*kirzstryfe uses a tnt brick on the tumbleweed

<MadSurge> Meanwhile: :D
<CCCP> Und whats und mean?
<Spectrum_Rush> CCCP: dude was alcapsing not heading rule reading suggestions and annoying evryone about nick stealing iei mine we tryed to warn him to chill out but he never listened

<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Pretty much. but yeah he was just painting a huge bulleye target on him

<MadSurge> killerpony7733: and he didn't discord the banhammer :D
<CCCP> Spectrum_Rush he honestly wasnt that bad at all :/
<Meanwhile> Then there's the tryhards who just want to feel like anyone cares.
<Spectrum_Rush> i'm german i has an excuse
<Wrek> 05i can respect if you do not agree that i banned him
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT kicks the tnt back to kirzstryfe and disappears in the horizon chasing the tumbleweed

<Serenity> So get run down by a car, stolen by crazy scientist and turned into a decoration you could wear on your head.
<Unnr> To get to the same side... >_>
<Golakka> haha Unnr
<Bunny_Striker> for an odd reason I`m imagining Pinkie Pie dressed as Jack Sparrow...
<Evil_Golakka> Why did the chicken walk into the Buckminster fuller wireframe?
<Major> Why did the ponies became My Little Pony?
<cowvarkian> because chicken is babby?
<Canadian_Brony> Evil_Golakka it didn't >_>
<Serenity> Chicken is always babby

<Polydunami> I think that's the case
<Vivix> 18+ and yeah, checked out
<cowvarkian> I get blood taken from me, like every month or so because of the medicine i'm on >.>
<Meanwhile> Back from tea break, did I miss anything of substance?
<cowvarkian> not really
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Not much.
<ShadowQuill> Beautiful
<Meanwhile> Didn't think I would.
<Polydunami> Oh, you mean mentally not a big deal. That's true
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: It's always nice to see others helping out. And don't wory, it's painless. :)
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> Hello ShadowQuill!
<ShadowQuill> You are a good artust
<ShadowQuill> GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Hi!
<Polydunami> Actually, this will be my third time giving blood :$
<cowvarkian> Oh, and I'm 15, but yeah
<ShadowQuill> GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Are you using an iPhone, then?
<cowvarkian> how much do they take from you?
<Ponies47> So GigabitHarmonie_Mobi, how's Vivi? :3
<Polydunami> Half a litre
<cowvarkian> ok then
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> ShadowQuill: Haha, iPhone, nice one.
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> ShadowQuill: No actually, on my laptop.
<Serenity> AJisawesome: Margarita
<Serenity> Now brb, for chat is ded
<XAX> Hmm. The blood transfusion unit thing came to our school recently too...
<Polydunami> I might as well give blood; I'm a universal donor after all :$
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> Ponies47: Last I heard she was having hard drive issues, thus her absence. :(
<ShadowQuill> GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Then why does it say Mobi? I thought you were trying to spell out mobile
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: Fair does. I'm still waiting on my next one. Had an opportunity on Tuesday, but thought it would be a bad idea after just coming back from BUCK...
<Ponies47> XAX: O.O
<ShadowQuill> As in phone
<Ponies47> brb
<ShadowQuill>
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: That and the fact my last was in June and I've to wait 4 months.
<Polydunami> Four months?
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> ShadowQuill: I did, but it's too long. I meant mobile as in laptop.
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: Or was it 3? :S
<ShadowQuill> kk
<Bronysith> Wrek: whatcu rolling on dark souls?

<Serenity> GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Same, I'm currently using camp internet, runs out tonight
<Serenity> Accessing this site through a shitty lapto
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: I dunno. Point is I first donated before Download and that was a bad idea, so I thought I'd avoid a repeat. XD
<Serenity> Yet it's somehow still better than El shitbox
<Polydunami> I understand
<ShadowQuill> Is Colgate gone
<cowvarkian> Ill brb
<Serenity> Then again
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> Serenity: A camp? :) Are you enjoying some camping?

<ShadowQuill> Colgate on Bronystate keeps telling people to change their names to incog
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: We get the blood vans at my workplace anyway, so it's really easy for me to do so. And I get off of work for a little while. ^_^
<Kandarihu> Hmm, once again with the alcohol, huh?
<Polydunami> Nice
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> Serenity: That sounds nice!
<Polydunami> We have a bank come by every couple of months
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: What's your blood group, if you don't mind? Mine's "O-".
<Serenity> Well, it seems serene I guess
<Polydunami> Same here, gildash :3
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Why?
<Serenity> All the jockos are back at school now I'm sure
<GigabitHarmonie_Mobi> What game are you playing GilDash|Gaming? :)
<AJIsAwesome> O- for me.
<Serenity> So no noise
<Kandarihu> I just got back from mowing the front lawn. Someone tossed an empty bottle of some alcoholic beverage in my lawn, as I found when I was out there.
<AJIsAwesome> *"O-"*
<GilDash|Gaming> Polydunami: I thought so when you said "people need my blood". Universal donors FTW. ^_^
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: I don't know. BaconMane says that you will be banned forever if you change your nick to that

<Canadian_Brony> nvmd
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Isn't it supposed to be the third Hallow?
<desertman2> The cloak is special, though
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, his hand's sweaty? Don't grab it!

<Barbetos> Nobby growths, for her pleasure.
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Yeah, so indeed might be one of a kind. But apparently you can put it in cars.
<Michael> all the strenght
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: So presumably it's stupidly rare, which begs the question of how the Weasley family can afford it....
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: i'd imagine that a cloak that moves all the time is a lot harder to do than a car which has a fixed exterior
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Great, what does that mean.
<Chrysalis|TF2> Shizuka what does that get you?
<Michael> strength*
<desertman2> I think the cloak doesn't wear off, however
<Shizuka> 13procaster is better than FMLE at certain games

<MASF123> I've fought before like 4 times in my life winning like 3 of them.
<Dark_Horst> flutterchu: muggle duel. frowned upon
*tSparx shivers at the thought of how badly I'd lose in a fight with anyone
<Dark_Horst> flutterchu: they did though in the books

<cowvarkian> <.<
<CriticKitten> In the wizarding world, having unique character traits is a bad sign
<Michael> wat
<Buytoast> always with the toast jokes
<tSparx> It would shorten the book by like 120 pages!
<Barbetos> that crazy laugh
<Michael> poor bird :(
<Barbetos> I would not drink out of tha cup
<Barbetos> Either of those cups
<flutterchu> http://imageshack.us/f/266/scan0112.jpg/

<CriticKitten> Poo!

*Bunny_Striker throws a boot to Canadian_Brony`s head
<CriticKitten> Chamber of Secrets is best name
<Canadian_Brony> Why does it have to be snakes?
<Meanwhile> Eh, that joke needs some work.
<tSparx> But I believe, Harry can save the world.
<Meanwhile> Mostly because it doesn't have enough syllables.
*Canadian_Brony catches boot and puts it down
<CriticKitten> >we've searched the school many times
<tSparx> BUT EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN LORD SLYTHERIN ATTACKED
<Bronysith> and then Meanwhile burst into flames

<CriticKitten> R63!
<cratorkid> r 63?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But Tumblr savior thought it was NSFW.
<Canadian_Brony> "Dangerous and rule breaking. Let's do it!"

<AJIsAwesome> Malk: Sweet!

<Michael> Canadian_Brony: a shirt, consider u lucky
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: so hwere are you located again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Do you have any stores that sells pony merch.
<Meanwhile> Dat ambiguity.
<Eulshy> Announcer is a boy
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: the UK
<Bronysith> hi Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01RaveBrony: where are you?
<Dark_Horst> hmm... i wonder if any blindbags ever made it to germany
<Michael> ohai Saturn
<RaveBrony> Saturn: NY :(
<Dark_Horst> does anybody know something about that?
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: of course they did! germany had them before the UK...
<CriticKitten> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome no. I have only found 1 pony toy, but that was a brushable RD. I don't want a brushable. She looked G3
<Dark_Horst> must've missed that
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i got my first blind bags in germany
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Guess they do hate Quiddich.
<Unnr> Why is the answer always Road Trip to Germany?
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: where exactly?
<CriticKitten> Quiddich! The only fake sport with a body count you don't even care about
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: Mueller
<tSparx> The blind bags are kinda rare in my town. Gotta know where and when to look >_>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also guess they're happy it was left out of Order of the Phoenix.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Oh.
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: the Mueller in Eisenach, i think
<Spademagnes[R]> What is this?
<Saturn> 08,01or somewhere near there
<fluttercry> 05,15also is it just me, or is the wizarding world like....terrifying
<Bunny_Striker> I have the lego set of this... until my siblings attacked...
<Saturn> 08,01may have been Jena
<Spademagnes[R]> Am I hearing the MST3K Cast riffing on Haryr potter?
<CriticKitten> Sneetch!
<Michael> Spademagnes[R]: harry potter
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: Never asked how you felt about JDL not coming to BUCK.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Spademagnes[R]. "Chamber is Secrets" with Rifftrax
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love the sneetch
<Canadian_Brony> Sneetch!

<CriticKitten> Dat Disembodio

<Dark_Horst> let's hope i can find something else
<tSparx> But then there's an army of wizards working for the Ministry, and they can fix everything with a few spells too
<Canadian_Brony> talking quidditch?
<Major> fluttercry: well is there a spell to bring Ponies to life? Nope :
<Major> :3
<tSparx> And also you wouldn't be too week
<tSparx> weak*
<Eulshy> His carreer as applejack
<CriticKitten> >arm broken
<tSparx> to stick up for yourself in wizardia
<thelonepony> ded
<CriticKitten> >has no trouble holding his broom while he goes for the snitch
<Canadian_Brony> Broken arm. Somehow holds onto broom.
<Michael> ball is hacked

<Spademagnes[R]> Hah
<Major> XD
<Wrek> 05JDL didnt show up, still grand success, cant even imagine how it would be with more celebs
<tSparx> "O come ye, by chants," = Venite Incanto
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: you dont happen to know they are available over here atm?
<fluttercry> 05,15ewww
<thelonepony> U fuck Teacher:[
<CriticKitten> Yep, that's still gross
<Michael> teacher, u failed beyond the impossible...
<Meanwhile> Stretch Armstrong. That's old.
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat arm
<GilDash> Wrek: Of the fucking chain, perhaps? Our attendees would increase to 2500 mimimum, I bet.
<tSparx> Sometimes these Latin spell-words just sound cool
<Bunny_Striker> lol
<tSparx> But do nothing else
<Canadian_Brony> dat side effect
<Shizuka> 13is it me... or if you actually removed the bones from a hand it still wouldn't be able to bend that way
<thelonepony> -up*
<Ponies47> Chat derped :/
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka it wouldn't be able to
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Well, magic obviously
<tSparx> Shizuka: Magic
<Shizuka> 13and or be horrifically painful as your muscles try to contract but have nothing to pull against
<Buytoast> imagine all the sinew and veins just floping around
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka that too
<Buytoast> the juices squishing and the flesh twisting
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka like I said. Terrifying
<Major> Shizuka: well it would be rather painful but yes
<thelonepony> kill
<Michael> destroy
<Canadian_Brony> KILL
<CriticKitten> >arm has no bones in it
<Ponies47> Crush
<CriticKitten> >have the arm in a sling
<Shizuka> 13they're growing back
<Canadian_Brony> swag
<Major> :O
<Thunder-Crescent> crush kill destroy swag
<tSparx> Shizuka: I think without your bones to press up against, you muscles aren't gonna be as taut, so it'd be fine.
<Meanwhile> The rebonin.
<thelonepony> for some reason i want to kill something\
<Canadian_Brony> ELF!!!
<tSparx> er, not as bad as all that.
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6526654208 bill clinton is a brony? huh
<Major> Shizuka: believe it or not, bones can actually grow back :P
<Shizuka> 13it's a pretty weak plot point though... harry gets owned by a bludger and has his arm de-boned
<Shizuka> 13grow the arm back in one night
<CriticKitten> Dobby: Pretty much the worst character.
<Pikachu> hi guys
<Major> XD
<Shizuka> 13yes bones grow back but the whole arm wouldn't take one night to recover
<fluttercry> 05,15isn't there a trope that says it makes sense if it's funny?
<Meanwhile> Whack 'em with your pool noodle arm
<tSparx> Shizuka: But character development!
<Michael> hai Pikachu
<flutter_spin> I'm so angry right now! :[
<tSparx> Hey Pika
<thelonepony> hi Pikachu
<Spademagnes[R]> This is hilarious
<AJIsAwesome> Pikachu: Hello!
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/20/MAsKY_mOTk2PkihJspzRLg2.gif
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin why?
<Chrysalis> does this make sense to you
<Shizuka> 13it's a weak excuse to get harry into the hospital wing to have a dobby encounter and witness the first basilisk victim
<Unnr> the scary part is not only re-growing the bones, but re-integrating everything else to the bone
<flutter_spin> I found out that a bag of stuff I threw away was dug out by my mother and hid in her closet.
<tSparx> It only takes one night because MAGIC
<Michael> slavery!
<tSparx> And that's seriously it
<CriticKitten> Idiotic Accords are best accords
<Thunder-Crescent> CHRYSALIS THATS CONFUSING
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: where's "here"?
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Saturn> 08,01and what?
<flutter_spin> This is why I can't throw away anything. My mother checks the trashcan every week
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis trippy, but I got it
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Leave me brain alone, it's too late at night for this and I've still not recovered from BUCK.
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: What was in it?
<Pikachu> hi Michael AJisAwsome tSprax thelonelypony
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: blindbags. germany
<MLP_Brovakiin> Chrysalis: way to break my brain
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: yes, they most certainly are
<Chrysalis> GilDash you think mine has?
<Saturn> 08,01and have been for over a year
<fluttercry> 05,15is being deboned a normal thing there? WHy is there a potion for it?
<Chrysalis> BUCK + moving house
<flutter_spin> old crayons, markers, pens
<Chrysalis> has completely destroyed mine
<Shizuka> 13honk shoe honk shoe
<flutterchu> Pikachu: didnt someone ban you last here let me say this to you more clearly *clear's throat* pika pika pi pikachu
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: kinda surprises me, i've never seen them anywhere. must be going to the wrong stores
<Michael> dem stealth
<tSparx> SHADE
<CriticKitten> "Dobby cannot say, because that would reveal the plot much too early and thus drastically shorten this book."
<Major> fluttercry: in case someone breaks there bone :P
<cratorkid> dam freeze tag
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Yeah, but I've been at work since I got back. With minimal sleep. -_-
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin perhaps a charm gone wrong. *cough*Lockhart*cough
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i don't think i got a proper chance to hug the hell out of you
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: also, you're really hot
<Spademagnes[R]> Foosh
<RaveBrony> Oh my
<Major> XD
<Chrysalis> Saturn i did hug you a couple of times
<Thunder-Crescent> agreed
<flutter_spin> Mom's hoarding is much worse than I anticipated
<Chrysalis> also, careful youll start chrysalis x Saturn
<fluttercry> 05,15TITLE DROP
<fluttercry> 05,15LOL
<flutter_spin> She now checks the trash to see if I threw anything away
<Spademagnes[R]> Rifftrax is the best thing ever
<Dark_Horst> youÄre not gandalf, who the fuck cares about what YOU say anyway??
<Thunder-Crescent> *sneaks up on chrusalis and glomps er*
<MLP_Brovakiin> meth lab
<Chrysalis> but thanks... i think
<Spademagnes[R]> I have to watch more of these
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Have you talked to your mother about this?
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis x Saturn. OTP.
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry that was dropped much earlier tho
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile X Trixie OTP
<Meanwhile> Damn,.
<Pikachu> flutterchu:idk i just came back from shcool6_9
<CriticKitten> R63 Potter
<flutter_spin> We have, my brother and I. She basically said "I'm a hoarder. There. Now stop throwing stuff away."
<Canadian_Brony> oh look, R63 Harry
<fluttercry> 05,15Canadian_Brony true I should have said "SCENE FOR THE TRAILER
<thelonepony> Pikachu how was it
<Pikachu> thelonelypony: fun
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Oh, that come back. XD
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry that's better
<flutter_spin> She refuses to throw away sandwich bags
<Spademagnes[R]> Ew
<cratorkid> Canadian_Brony: its marry
<cratorkid> lol
<Ponies47> Guess who I found in anthor chatroom I go in. Specturm_Speed
<Michael> dis will be good
<Chrysalis> its kinda like a burn
<Chrysalis> only saxier
<Canadian_Brony> cratorkid . . . wut?
<Meanwhile> C'mon Al, you don't wanna be the last one in. WHAT?
<fluttercry> 05,15ninja wizards?
<fluttercry> 05,15do it
<cratorkid> Canadian_Brony: nothing , nvm
<CriticKitten> So I have an honest question. Is there ever actually a reason to wear a cape that only covers one half of you?
<Canadian_Brony> k
<flutter_spin> - be cool
<flutterchu> hey this scene was in the third video game for original xbox
<Michael> snope
<Spademagnes[R]> Why is this so hilarious?
<CriticKitten> I mean yes, it looks cool, but any real reason?
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Just giving some advice, you should stop this before this gets worse. That may sound cliche, but trust me.
<MLP_Brovakiin> potatoe
<tSparx> CriticKitten: Well, if it's like, a warmish autumn day, too hot for a full cape, but too cold for no cape.
<Canadian_Brony> I bet Snape enjoyed partaking in this duel
<thelonepony> Snape is best Wizard
<Michael> owned
<Shizuka> 13and then snape gives harry his signature spell
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: Bullet proof cape?
<Meanwhile> Now do it again.
<Canadian_Brony> why didn't he block?
<Shizuka> 13nice job breaking VVT snape
<flutter_spin> I can't do anything about it.
<Spademagnes[R]> VVT?
<Dark_Horst> Canadian_Brony: he's an idiot
<Shizuka> 13VVT!
<Canadian_Brony> Pfpfpfpretty obicous
<Spademagnes[R]> The hell is VVT?
<flutter_spin> I wouldn't mind so much if she wasn't checking MY stuff and complaining about not having money
<CriticKitten> What? Teach defense?
<tSparx> Shizuka: You don't think his signature spell is his awesome Patronus?
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Oh. Ok.
<CriticKitten> Imagine that
<Canadian_Brony> "Devestate spell" is simple?
<Michael> VVT? someone explain please
<Shizuka> 13tSparx: no the disarming spell is his signature since harry never aims to cause harm
<Dark_Horst> what i'm wondering, why are there no spells to conjure, say, a cruise missile?
<Shizuka> 13thus why it succeeds against VVT whenever they meet
<fluttercry> 05,15Trailer scene!
<flutter_spin> It might sound cruel, but I look forward to when she passes everything down to me. She told me that herself.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: and it ends up putting him in jeopardy because of that fact
<tSparx> Shizuka: I know he uses it a lot, like at Voldemort during the fleeing of Privet Drive
<cowvarkian> disarm = kill
<Spademagnes[R]> What a ass
<Canadian_Brony> "Only disarm!" barrel roll
<MLP_Brovakiin> FUS RO DA
<CriticKitten> Sweep the leg
<fluttercry> 05,15Sweep the leg!
<CriticKitten> XD
<Meanwhile> Sweep the leg.
<Barbetos> Wow he said Bonkers?
<tSparx> Shizuka: But when I think "Harry's Spells," even though he probably uses expelliarmus most, I think of Expecto Patronus
<fluttercry> 05,15Put em in a body bag!
<Michael> dat summon
<Meanwhile> Lockhart as usual, is useless.
<Michael> fail
<CriticKitten> Well that worked well
<Major> XD
<Meanwhile> The doofusssss.

<Dr_Nick> How do you do itallics?
<Canadian_Brony> Slenderman role-playing
<sub06905> By Celestia's and Hagrid's Beard!
<RaveBrony> Slenderman: '/me' is baically RP
*cowvarkian uses the /me all the time
<Unnr> Little know to the wizard community, Dumbledor introduced the Hogwarts Scarf because he was a secret fan of The Doctor
<Spademagnes[R]> Holy hell
<Michael> oh my gosh
*cowvarkian isnt RPing though
<Meanwhile> I was bored. Hoo.
<RaveBrony> Its overuse of it
<DeathStar> Major: gamer_luna's in Dashiesauce
<Canadian_Brony> Dr_Nick "/me" at the beginning of your message. Just don't overuse it
<RaveBrony> ^
<Slenderman> -__-
<Canadian_Brony> ohai DeathStar
*cowvarkian tottaly doesnt overuse it
*JRP is bored and using /me to /me me
<Thunder-Crescent> im eating ice cream
<RaveBrony> =_(\
<cowvarkian> o u
*Unnr thinks that /me is great for speaking in the third person. Because illeism is fun.
<Spademagnes[R]> Do you people have death wishes?
<Slenderman> Who's doing the commentary?
<Meanwhile> Und dann people were dingbats.
<tSparx> I must appreciate the use of illeism as a word!
<Canadian_Brony> Slenderman Rifftrax
<Slenderman> Oh.
<tSparx> But seriously, what's wrong with using Me?
*cowvarkian thinks that being kicked for speaking with /me is bloody silly
<Michael> not hermione!
<Meanwhile> Nothing until it's used excessively.
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay, next person to use /me gets a timeban. this is getting stupid. Let it go for a while
<RaveBrony> Nothing, but the OVerUse of/me is a problem
<Unnr> Illeism is one of the great underused words.
<cowvarkian> so tempting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not that hard to not type /me
<Spademagnes[R]> So who shall be the first victim?
<flutterchu> see there voices get deeper
<fluttercry> 05,15If you do it to tempt us. Enjoy the permaban
<JRP> Let's play to quiet game
<Barbetos> Do it cowvarkian it will make you a real brony state hero!
<Thunder-Crescent> AN HAMMER IS ARED
<FillyFlam> NUUU exeptions.
<Thunder-Crescent> ARMED*
*cowvarkian will brb
<RaveBrony> x_(\
<desertman2> -_-
<Spademagnes[R]> AND DEAD

<Barbetos> Wow. I can't believe that worked
<Meanwhile> Boom.

<VenHur> I think Maleficent was behind all of this...
<RaveBrony> or 24h? :o
<thelonepony> well that suck for cowarkin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011 hr
<Spademagnes[R]> Crossbow?
<Canadian_Brony> change "said" to "did"
<RaveBrony> Well, his fault for doing it, lol
<Dark_Horst> Crossbow!
<thelonepony> lol indeed
<Unnr> To be fair, the statement was made, cowvarkian was tempted, and knew what they were getting into
<Shizuka> 13IT'S THE FUZZ
<thelonepony> he has the dawnguard dlc
<Spademagnes[R]> Any other takers?
<MLP_Brovakiin> He was expecting people from student loans
<Shizuka> 13CHEESE IT
<Spademagnes[R]> RUN
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka dem slogans
<Bronysith> oh shit, almsot typed in /me
<tSparx> I guess I just don't see why it's a big deal. It's one thing for Slenderman to come in and be all slender-y. But if I wanted to talk entirely in the third person, just as me, tSparx, why not?
<Meanwhile> My my here comes the fuzz.
<flutterchu> reminds me of miles edgeworth 2
<Spademagnes[R]> So will there be any other suckers to take the /me bait?
<Slenderman> What?
<Shizuka> 13the phuzz
<Slenderman> I heard a ping?
<Canadian_Brony> Spademagnes[R] no
<fluttercry> 05,15Because it's annoying. and most of all because the mods said so. Which, if you'll read the rules, is reason enough.
<Canadian_Brony> I hope not
<Shizuka> 13wow
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Shizuka> 13fudge's actor
<Meanwhile> You know that I Nebbacanezzar.
<Shizuka> 13between here and phoenix he gets... OLD
<Shizuka> 13like that kind of aging that implies fear
<Shizuka> 13very nice
<FillyFlam> Fudge looks like he would make a good Bilbo.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Andy Price Interview on Celestia Radio Tonight!
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka he also has the best line in phoenix
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Glad no-one flushed the toilet of secrets.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i did though...
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: SO MUCH CLOGGING
<fluttercry> 05,15Xbox brah
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Supertoilet.
<Shizuka> 13ah yeah he could be a good bilbo
<Michael> Nittany_Discord: lol
<Spademagnes[R]> So how the hell did people avoid flushing the secret toilet all these years?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I'm playing xbox brah :D
<tSparx> fluttercry I'll respect what the mods say. I'm not gonna be obstinate. I just hope the mods never tell me to stop using wink-smileys or something, 'cause I will get permabanned :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: No!
<Unnr> The toilet of secrets secret is that it is, in fact, SUPER TOILET!
<Shizuka> 13i don't see martin freeman as bilbo... H2G2 ruined it for me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Supertoilet of SEcrets?
<flutterchu> 1 hour left :$
<RaveBrony> :D
<VenHur> AAAH! NOT THE SUPPER CLOGGING TOILET OF DEATH AND DOOM! ...I has to say that.
<CriticKitten> SOOOOONG
<Spademagnes[R]> Seriously, how did they manage to avoid flushing the special toilet
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<Shizuka> 13he's looking at us!
<Slenderman> flluttercry: Their is nothing in the rules that says no roleplaying. The only related rule is no trolling. Trolling and Roleplaying are 2 very diffrent things
<tSparx> Harry Potter: The Musical
<Shizuka> 13WARNING FOURTH WALL BREACH THIS IS NOT A DRILL
<Pyroid> harry potter ytp?
<RaveBrony> Haha :D
<flutterchu> VenHur: the only person who agrees is sweetie poo
<Pyroid> what is this
<Spademagnes[R]> HE KNOWS
<fluttercry> 05,15Slenderman it's been a rule for a while. There is also a rule that says if mods say don't do it. then don't do it.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka and it isn't Pinkie Pie? TO THE BUNKERS!!
<thelonepony> Dubbletroll knows!
<FillyFlam> Pyroid: Rifftrax of Chamber of Secrets.
<Michael> dat cap
<Slenderman> -__-
<Shizuka> 13subtle hagrid
<Pyroid> hahaha
<Shizuka> 13keep to heavy, let others play spy
<Spademagnes[R]> SUBTLE
<RaveBrony> "Rules are subject to change" anyway :D
<tSparx> Pinkie Pie and Deadpool could tear down the fourth wall
<Slenderman> I still don't see what your problem with role playing is but whatever.
<thelonepony> true^
<MLP_Brovakiin> Slenderman: There is a seperate chat for RP I think
<VenHur> Shizuka: Oh shi-MAN ALL BATTLESHIPS! IT'S A CODE BLUE!
<Slenderman> YES
<Meanwhile> Presumably Fawkes is playing pyro.
<flutterchu> miles edgeworth 2 alot
<Slenderman> WHERE
<Shizuka> 13Slenderman: because bronystate is not your personal RP channel, make your own to spam RP everywhere
<AJIsAwesome> Slenderman: If you have a problem, leave.
<fluttercry> 05,15That music is pretty mysterious
<Slenderman> I don't
<Slenderman> I said whatever
<Thunder-Crescent> the music is very mysterious
<Spademagnes[R]> Blast Mchardcheese
<AJIsAwesome> DAT MYSTERIOUS MUSIC
<Meanwhile> Shelob.
<Slenderman> Their is a diffrence between having a problem and having no say at all in it\
<Spademagnes[R]> Hah!
<FillyFlam> Follow the great butterfly migration.
<MLP_Brovakiin> hahaha
<Thrackerzod> XD
<Slenderman> I don't care then
<Meanwhile> The Enterprise?
<Spademagnes[R]> PFAHAHA
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<Wrek> 05so much crossover
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of these storylines.
<tSparx> lol
<Spademagnes[R]> Why is this so fucking funny?
<VenHur> Wonder if one of those trees is Fluttertree?
<Shizuka> 13they keep that summer blockbuster vacation gag up through phoenix i think
<Spademagnes[R]> I cant stop laughing
<Canadian_Brony> Spademagnes[R] Rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13at least through goblet
<Michael> dat forest
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: You showing all of these?
<Michael> so many spiders!
<tSparx> Pinkie Pie would start laughing her ass off right about now
<Shizuka> 13hope so
<Slenderman> She has no ass
<fluttercry> 05,15yay!
<VenHur> SPIDERS?! Why did it HAVE to be SPIDERS?!
<Slenderman> Pinkie has a flank and plot
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: You'll clip into the weekend at this rate though yes?
<Shizuka> 13might stop at goblet since riffs are a pain in the flank to sync up... and if comcast died midway we'd be out of luck
<Slenderman> BIG DIFFRENCE
<Canadian_Brony> I love "Chamber of Secrets" on DVD cuz it has a game on it where you drive the car out of the forest. SO MUCH FUN
<Shizuka> 13you can't really pause a "real" rifftrax or you lose sync
<Spademagnes[R]> Spidereses
<Meanwhile> Plot break.
<thelonepony> earth defense force all over again!
<Darf14> Hello :) .... wait Harry Potter? did we see th-... oh its a riff :)
<Magical_Pablez94> Slenderman i agree with you... i just don't understand why they're so butt hurted about RP.... i remember why i left from here months ago, now...
<Canadian_Brony> hi Darf14
<VenHur> "Whooo is it?" PIZZA HUT DELIVERY!
<Meanwhile> Is Aragog bigger here than in Hallows or is it just me?
<FillyFlam> Hiya Darf14
<MLP_Brovakiin> This is hilarious :D
<Shizuka> 13aragog sounds like a bag of potato chip being thrown against a chainlink fence
<tSparx> Well, Pinkie would laugh her [insert appropriate Brony-talk here] off
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile he's bigger
<Michael> hai Darf14
<Spectrum_Rush> syncing these is a pain i'm guessing Shizuka ?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Darf14
<Darf14> hello :)
<Shizuka> 13it really is
<Slenderman> Yah well we have to deal with it.
<Shizuka> 13you only have dis to work with
<Shizuka> 13mike does a "1, 2, 3, pause" thing for some cue at the start of the film to get you close, but you're always like two seconds off by the time dis shows up
<Darf14> could be worse, Harry might see 60's spider man
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> minecraft needs a siege mode
<Spectrum_Rush> well Shizuka let me be the irst to say you've done a wonderful job doing so
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back and------WAIT! WAIT! Harry Potter again??? YES YES YES
<Shizuka> 13within a couple dis lines you can get it synced, especially after watching a few times (so you see what shots line up with riffs), but yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15Isn't there a thing on the site that syncs for you?
<Shizuka> 13the rifftrax i show are presynced videos from torrents
<Spademagnes[R]> NOT THE SPIDERS
<Michael> Wb Dark92Enigma
<Darf14> Spiders! Spiders Everywhere
<Dark_Horst> having 360° field of view might be a little pain in the ass with basilisks around
<Shizuka> 13they have it but it's a DVD player
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<Spademagnes[R]> Horrible flashbacks
<Darf14> Spider Clowns... The horror! THE HORROR!

<Michael> ^^
<Barbetos> It had babies?
<Spademagnes[R]> BRILLIANT!
<Petrified_Discord> The car is too OP to be in Deathly Hallows
<tSparx> Shizuka: It could've driven straight into Voldemort after driving on the bridge while it was blowing up
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: Totally agree!!!!
<alexxm> i'd trust him
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka . . . minus the mini coopers, but otherwise yeah
<tSparx> Running *next* to Neville
<Darf14> This is why Hogwarts should have a good law system... and Phoenix wright

<Canadian_Brony> PinkieSpice probably
<PinkieSpice> ah
<tSparx> Sketch_Toku_Brony: So Tom Riddle is a ghost who lives in a journal Harry found
<PinkieSpice> I had something to tell him ;A;
<tSparx> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Now they're down in a big dark tunnel with a giant snake and Mr. Riddle
<Canadian_Brony> PinkieSpice he'll be back.
<Dark92Enigma> Jim Carrey fits the role, but what if THIS guy would've played as him <--
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah ok thanks tSparx

<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile good point.....
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx we saw the riff of the 1st movie last night. Hagrid said he was "VVT", so we picked it up.
<Baka-Neku> i am so sorry D:

<Meanwhile> Speaking of giant spiders, there's one on my floor. Brb.
<tSparx> Meanwhile: Haha, gl
<Michael> dat is a huge... animal
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile tell Dr Smith i said hello!
<LunarSS> Meanwhile: Don't let it near your face!
<Phase4> thing you have to be carefull with in minecraft when adding blocks is wether or not its functional on its own
<Quick_Thinker> ROAR
<Canadian_Brony> dat trip
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile: just kidding
<Phase4> thats a bad way to word that
<Darf14> Phoenix > Snake
<MLP_Brovakiin> haha I used to have heelies :D
<Dark92Enigma> MY EEEEEEEEEEYES!
<Phase4> you cant just slap a 'do this thing' block into the game
<tSparx> I wanna go rolleskating now xD
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, I found out the hard way that if you have mods with nukes...don't set off 45
<CriticKitten> How cunning
<Phase4> XD
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: I never understood the point in heelies.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i knew it
<Barbetos> Is it a rule that you alos be stupid when evil?
<spitfirecolt> i am signed up for the new comic book anypony else getting it
<tSparx> ouch
<tSparx> dat pun
<Canadian_Brony> ugh, I feel like I should put in a semi-long explanation of how snakes track their prey.
<Eulshy> grate
<Canadian_Brony> so here it is
<Phase4> but yeah, blocks have to be componants for things
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: What comic?
<tSparx> Barbetos: Not always.
<Michael> dat teeth
<Eulshy> with tongue
<Dark92Enigma> DEM TEETH
<tSparx> Just ask the Spiral/Helix King
<Dark92Enigma> Sorry
<spitfirecolt> the new mlp comic coming out in nov
<CriticKitten> Apparently the snake doesn't have any sense of smell
<Dark92Enigma> SONIC says ....I'm over there
<Buytoast> everything smells the same down there
<Dark92Enigma> <-----
<Buytoast> raw sewege
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<tSparx> Barbetos: Or Jigsaw. VVT himself is pretty smart, though Riddle isn't.
<AJIsAwesome> spitfirecolt: I heard about that. Maybe.
<Michael> CriticKitten: plothole?
<flutterchu> ill be right back
<Phase4> if you make a 'do this' block you prevent anyone from being clever and combining it with other blocks
<tSparx> I do like smart villians, and there aren't enough of them
<spitfirecolt> i preordered the boxset
<Quick_Thinker> ^ box set for what>?
<CriticKitten> Buytoast: Maybe to you. Animal senses, especially smell, tend to be pretty good at that sort of thing. :p
<Dark92Enigma> Get it? I'm over there! <---- NEVERMIND
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: I like fun villains the most.
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How is he alive now?
<Dark92Enigma> EXTRA SUPER ALIVE!
<CriticKitten> Oh look, a MacGuffin
<Eulshy> soul stealing is all the rage
<Michael> magic sword!

<Baka-Neku> ok this time im gonna copy paste the RIGHT link not spam again >.< http://baka-neku.deviantart.com/#/d5bxns6 one of the newest vector i did :3 just wanna share it [Sad]
<Canadian_Brony> Snakes use their fork-like tongue to "smell" the air, and special sensors under its eyes to track prey thermally.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Well actually my fav villians are morally ambiguous ones. Magneto etc. (though he's pretty evil), Rossiu from Gurren Lagann
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: IT's supossed to be a memory......magic i guess
<tSparx> (for a few eps)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Frostmourne!
<Buytoast> so why didn't voldemort just use basilisks to attack in the last movie
<Buytoast> i mena hell
<Buytoast> he could've kill them all
<SB64> i liek poniez
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord technically, he isn't. Think of Moaning Myrtle, just more life-like.
<tSparx> Buytoast: That shit's expensive!
<Quick_Thinker> one you cant bring something ded back
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Obviously Discord for me and Hades from Kid Icarus Uprising. Know any fun villains?
<fluttercry> 05,15Dat Mr. Bean
<tSparx> Buytoast: Also they're really rare
<CriticKitten> Buytoast: Obviously he only had one small snake, an army of shitty wizards, and absolutely nothing else.
<Michael> stab stab stab

<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka eeyup
<CriticKitten> Shizu: They call it the Aeris Effect
<AJIsAwesome> http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/334900_o.gif
<Michael> lol dat phoenix have a lot of strength
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was just a plot device Shizuka.
<CriticKitten> Or is it Aerith? Either or
<Shizuka> 13i thought the aeris effect is a certain macguffin works every single time EXCEPT when needed most
<fluttercry> 05,15Is it just me, or is a lot of HP writing VERY lazy?
<DoctoDoctorWho> basilisk venom is one of the few things that can destroy hocruxes, throwing it in a fire or a toilet wouldnt have worked
<Quick_Thinker> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Shizuka> 13i.e. phoenix downs
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka they were used for this chapter........and never mentioned again Aeris Effect much?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: needs more phoenix down
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ASScabin lol
<tSparx> shizuka that's always been my understanding
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phoenix down maid outfit. So soft.
<Dark92Enigma> Break a thousand rules.......get awarded?

<tSparx> Dark92Enigma: It's Dumbledore's school, he'll do what he wants.
<fluttercry> 05,15FF7 ruined FF
<fluttercry> 05,15just sayin
<Dark92Enigma> tSparx: IKR?
<Shizuka> 13nah
<Shizuka> 13ff8 did
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<CriticKitten> Shizu: It can also be neatly utilized by bringing an extremely powerful macguffin into play to rescue a character, only to never use it again because no one else is important
<Phase4> 00,02what the shit
<Shizuka> 13never managed to finish 8
<Quick_Thinker> how many dillects of klingon are there?
<Michael> fluttercry: why?
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked 7. Don't get me wrong. Just...after that
<Canadian_Brony> hi Phase4
<Bronysith> Shizuka: ff13 is just god awful
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02'bonjour', an apple thing
<desertman2> Hey, ff9 was awesome
<ShadowDash> :[
<Dark92Enigma> DoctoDoctorWho: How is KONG doing?
<fluttercry> 05,15After 7 it just went bad
<Phase4> 00,02wants me to close xchat before i can uninstall it
<LunarSS> i thought FF8 and 9 were fime
<Barbetos> ff8 was fine, but the fandom over 7 ruined the searies i think.
<Bronysith> flutterchu: 6 and 7 are the peak of final fantasy
<Meanwhile> Never liked Final Fantasy.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: eeeyup welcome to apple!
<Phase4> 00,02how does that even work
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i liked FF4 on PSP,fun game
<Canadian_Brony> how did we get into Final Fantasy?
<AJIsAwesome> I like FF, just wasn't into it.
<Canadian_Brony> just askin'
<VenHur> I was looking at the Guest Riffers, and I was jawdropped that Weird Al and the TGWTG crew was guest stared on Rifftrax!
<Quick_Thinker> no clue
<tSparx> Shizuka: You take that back. I've got no problem with FFVII, but 8 (and 9) had a fantastic story, great soundtrack, good gameplay.
<Bronysith> fluttercry: 6 and 7 are the peak of Final Fantasy man
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony: BECAUSE of the Aeris Effect
<Shizuka> 13bonjour is apple's networking platform i think, probably has hooks into the NIC that xchat is holding open
<fluttercry> 05,15FF6 is best FF
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma . . . and that is?
<Eulshy> IM EATING TACO'S BE JEALOUS
<Bronysith> flutterchu: yup. and chrono trigger is far surperior to that
<Shizuka> 138's music was okay but... ughhh they needed a new protagonist than Cloud part deux
<VenHur> I'm dead serious, I has proof.
<PinkieSpice> Albus the wrost discord. :U
<Bronysith> fluttercry: and chrono trigger is far surperior to all final fantasies
<fluttercry> 05,15Yes
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark92Enigma: kinda quiet, its actually sorta bland compared to bronystate but I keep an eye on it, :3
<tSparx> I agree that the best FF's were pre-VII, but
<Bronysith> FF6 AND FF7 ARE BEST ONES
<LunarSS> i think a lot of people just hate on FF8 because of spoony and have never actually played it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol is that David Bowie from Labrynth? :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never played most Square RPGs :<
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka also drawing magic.
<Shizuka> 13cloud's character development was good and did great with the flashbacks and his faulty memory
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except Super Mario 64.
<ShadowDash> :P
<Eulshy> Bronysith, FF3
<Shizuka> 13but we really didn't need his personality all over again with squall
<PinkieSpice> =_=
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I mean Super Mario RPG >(\
<Bronysith> Eulshy: that is final fantasy 6. the one with kefka
*PinkieSpice kicks the sleeping SuperBrony64
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: or every character after :S
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian let's say....Deus Ex Machina used at the climax of a movie......never used in any sequel.....pretty much frequent in Final Fantasy. Hence the similarity
<Shizuka> 13haven't played any of the other FFs
<tSparx> My favorite Final Fantasy is Chrono Trigger
<PinkieSpice> ;A: darn you. Right when I have something awesome to tell ya.
<Shizuka> 13VVT

<ShadowQuill> WT
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: It's okay. Just something happened earlier that we're trying to take it easy.
<Dark92Enigma> oh

<JRP> Super metroid was a epic game
<Buytoast> catholic Nutjob radio?
<Dark_Horst> i know that i loved crysis 1. good action, good tactics, overall awesoem gameplay and amazing graphics. games should be more like the forst crysis
<VenHur> Now that game is the deffinition of HARD.

<soulrider95> fluttercry: contra
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry I would expect good graphics from a newer game, but I prefer gameplay mechanics and whatnot. Who cares if it looks like real life when a simple task forces you to search a 50-page instruction manual.
<Eulshy> fluttercry, can we watch egoraptor?
<Tovler|ChillOut> tax exempt, therefore were reimbursing them?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon ah man i LOVE Dark Souls,demon's souls was kinda linear

<Bronysith> otakon: what do you think of kingdom hearts 1 and 2?
<DoctoDoctorWho> has anyone ever seen that movie?
<Canadian_Brony> I would like to, but there's no point reserving a spot for me cuz TF2 will probably crash.

<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Tell me about it.
<otakon> Bronysith: simple but likable characters and stories
<Shizuka> 13each level the music pitches up and the influence of the field gets more intense
<Buytoast> i think i've seen some of the hunt for red september
<Bronysith> otakon: spent 3 dollars on it at a flea market...30 hours of gameplay from story alone
<Shizuka> 13you can see it in the particles that whip around
<otakon> Bronysith: you RUINED IT FOR YOURSELF THEN! goddammit you NEVER play the sequel
<otakon> before the original
<Bronysith> otakon: what? i did play the original

<FillyFlam> Shizuka: Oh, so the ball goes with the "current" in the background? Like the way it flows?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Major> I have no idea whats going on but I find it entertaining....
<Shizuka> 13thus the sucking in and jet mechanics
<Bronysith> otakon: i played and beat kingdom hearts 1 so oh so many years ago i beat it. havent played it for a while so when i played 2 it was a bit hazy lol

<kirzstryfe> Shizuka said the team, apparently nobody was paying attention
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Spademagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: People need to learn to grow a pari and stop bitching about ponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even if I didn't like ponies, I would tell those people to get over it.
<Malk> Kirzstryfe how did they steal the spots?
<Darf14> Medics and Pryros are useless?! Time to prove your friend wrong
<Spademagnes[R]> *pair
<Pikachu> Fire fire fire..................
<Canadian_Brony> Darf14 I'm showing him this.
<alexxm> so much fire
<Saturn> 08,01okay, everypony

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey i di say if there was a spot kirzstryfe :p blame sub
<Saturn> 08,01but it needs to be absolutely perfect
<Major> Saturn: Ive seen a few :P
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm willing to spend a *lot* of money on it
<Darf14> man it takes forever to get into a match
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I will start looking.
<Canadian_Brony> gimme a couple minutes
<Yahooz> This plushie was going to be perfect...
<CriticKitten> This plushie is going to be perfect, the kind of plush of which he dreamed since he was small.
<Saturn> 08,01can someone recommend me a plush maker to commission it, or link me a currently running ebay auction
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I'm looking right now.
<Pikachu> i already have one ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad that one plushie maker had to stop making plushies.
<Pikachu> but ill look
<Canadian_Brony> $2000 was the first I found
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Due to badly-written trademark laws.
<Canadian_Brony> O__________O
<Major> Saturn: hows this? http://fav.me/d4ynfr0
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wish I could sell something for $2000.
<Yahooz> every plushie will gather around, itll look lovely on the shelf, what they dont know is that i got it for freeeee
<DoctoDoctorWho> You could look up that one guy who made the RD plushie that went 4 nearly 3k
<Saturn> 08,01Major: hmm... it's nice, but not... perfect
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Once I get money, I'm replacing a fragile Fausticorn I had that shattered.
<otakon> Saturn: I found nothing, time to look for plushie makers on DeviantArt or maybe even FurAffinity
<Darf14> he should heal up
<Darf14> .....NV
<otakon> Darf14: she's fine
<otakon> Darf14: Shizu is playing the Pyro and she's a GOOD pyro
<otakon> Darf14: if a little axe happy
<Darf14> huh didnt know Shizu is playing
<otakon> lol poor Caramel
<otakon> Darf14: she's streaming
<CriticKitten> o.o
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ill keep my eyes out Saturn, anything to repay you for helping me with my bronystate account
<Major> Saturn: http://fav.me/d51l55i ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam is screwy today for some reason.
<CriticKitten> How'd that person get up thar. o.o
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it's working fine for me
<otakon> OH I was wondering
<flutterchu> oh man i wish i can link this video but that would be braking the rules
<otakon> has anyone here heard of Dins' Curse?
<otakon> bc it looks good
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, has it been causing other programs to run slowly?
<otakon> for those who can't/won't get Diablo 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh, it's updating.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, it wasn't starting.
<CriticKitten> Better than Torchlight 2, otakon?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And right when I killed it, it started updating.
<otakon> CriticKitten: probably not, but it's a indie game and it's only 9 bucks
<Kandarihu> My mom had trouble with Open Office earlier. It also had problems starting.
<Darf14> nope never heard of Dins Curse
<otakon> OH FOR CHRISTS SAKE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't buy Diablo 3 because of the DRM.
<Darf14> I for one welcome our robot overlords
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: http://derpy.me/BuV9Q
<Major> AJIsAwesome: aw I was about to post that :D
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well Din's Curse is all of that hack n slash goodness with NO DRM, it's a indie title and there is dynamic quests. Your town can get attacked while you're down in a dungeon and if you don't defend it you have to start over ...but with your gear/levels intact.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Has someone linked this one yet Saturn? http://mlpforums.com/topic/14685-2000-chrysalis-plushie/
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: i quite like the top of that one, but not the bottom

<Darf14> 1 tank? No problem
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though she may be back up.
<Shizuka> 13wasn't shut down, just had to stop having prices on dA
<DoctoDoctorWho> Major: one could always request another,
<Saturn> 08,01Pikachu: no offense to the person who made that, but it looks like someone has just dribbled mint choc chip icecream... down... nightmare... moon... i'll be in my bunk
<Pikachu> Saturn: your right
<Major> Saturn: http://fav.me/d4xta9a Do you mean something like this? (And no its not for sale) x3
<otakon> Saturn: you tosser
<Canadian_Brony> sold, sold, not for sale, sold . . .

<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Cuz if neccesary I could get another one just like it, seriously I excel in these things
<Caramel> so I don't have mIRC any more
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn this could take a while. I'v got an eye for deatil, but I can't look at anything I can't find.

<DuskStarshimmer> Darf14, I'd like ot get a bucnh of ppl on my tekkit server to build the level, then I'll just model everything up and I wont hacve to create soo much :D
<Major> Caramel: how much are you being paid for it? :P
<DuskStarshimmer> So its an open invite, anyone who wants to help design my MvM level, pm me
<Caramel> enough to pay for college, not nearly enough to justify the work I put in
<IshInsertRandomNick> where da robot women at
<Darf14> ok :)
<DuskStarshimmer> I cna host it as regualr minecraft too if tekkit is unknown to anyone intereted
<Pikachu> DuskStarShummer: im playing minecraft right now XD

<Major> SuperBrony64: O///////O
<otakon> brb gotta get the dog to stop chewing on my door

<Meanwhile> And Mishia, the clue is in the...yeah that, thanks.

<Mishia> XD
<otakon> Shizuka: okay seriously can you teach me or something how to effectively play Pyro? I tried and I do NOT get the same results as you on even a small run.
<Meanwhile> otakon: stay mobile learn the flamethrowers arc and practice the airblast.
<Mishia> No no i just dint want any hostilities because i have been playing on my fav. server where one guy will not stop killing me and only me. Apperently, my name he dosent like

<Shizuka> 13i find burn time/damage isn't worth it
<Shizuka> 13if the bot is alive long enough to be taking the damage/time, we're losing
<Phase4> 00,02^
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Shizuka: unless youre good with the Axestinguisher
<kirz|art> hate drawing feet
<Shizuka> 13better that they don't get past me at all
<kirz|art> hands too
<Phase4> 00,02i came to the same conclusion when i tried pyro
<Shizuka> 13i'm good with ax combos normally, but this is too many people at once to try it
<Shizuka> 13W+M1 is more effective
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm loving this
<otakon> W+m1?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yeah its best saved for the harder modes imo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14drawing Lyra art? XD
<Meanwhile> otakon: Run forward and shoot.
<Barbetos> This game has always been and always will be about spam
<otakon> so...damage all the way?

<Meanwhile> It has a song.
<otakon> so that is the pyro car
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...this song is going well with Gangnam Style
<otakon> lol

<otakon> well yay first kick of the night...goddammit
<kirz|art> trying an actual human figure, something I've never really done before
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Yahooz> Gangnam style is like Guiles theme... it goes with everything

<Caramel> Caramel is a male...and I wont tolerate trolling to imply otherwise -_-
<Mishia> Shizuka: i am that one pyro who hops into battle and sets everyone aflame
<Engi> ...I wasn't trolling
<Caramel> otakon: I can if you want
<Engi> I just think she's cute as a transpony
<otakon> Caramel: well superretroworld was wondering

<Kandarihu> You know, I read some griping about the SYMPATHY system, but imo, it's working pretty nicely.
<Canadian_Brony> my tongue feels weird
<Canadian_Brony> it may have something to do with the fact I've been sucking on a toothpick for half an hour
<Flootahshy> Canadian_Brony: Rub it with sandpaper.
<Kandarihu> I suppose it could use some work, but there's always room for it.
<Canadian_Brony> Flootahshy done that before. It wasn't pleasant
<Flootahshy> Canadian_Brony: What? Why?
<Canadian_Brony> Truth or Dare
<Canadian_Brony> I'm 15, k?

<Canadian_Brony> DAMMIT
<Flootahshy> Scoot-Scootaloo: I like consoles!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Flootahshy: A German company exists that resells digitally-downloaded software, so I guess so.
<superretroworld> Scoot-Scootaloo: there still populat today
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scoot-Scootaloo: I never said I hated consoles.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Hello
<Canadian_Brony> hi Cranberry_Scotch
<spitfirecolt> me too i like consoles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dislike where the Xbox is and the PS3 is going.
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<SuperBrony64_> Consoles are way better than PC :)
<Cranberry_Scotch> What do you mean?
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64_: You're wrong.
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64_: In fact you support nintendo so you're extra wrong.
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64_: In fact you're you so you're extra extra wrong.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Nintendo isn't bad
<Flootahshy> I predict a heated debate about consoles vs. PC?
<Meanwhile> You are the wrongest wrong who was ever wrong about not being right.
<Dark_Horst> ah there we go
<Dark_Horst> steam must hate me
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We need to get some console games all up in here, like what SB already does :D
<Reikim> Wait what
<JRP> SuperBrony64_: stop
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I probably won't buy a next gen console even if I have the money because of how badly console manufacturers are locking them down.
<JRP> Hammer time
<Reikim> Something about supporting Nintendo being wrong?
<Shizuka> 13they are so silly
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile takes one to know one.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope the rumors turn out to be false.
<SuperBrony64_> I liek silleh :3
<Meanwhile> Canadian_Brony: By that logic it takes a pedofile to know onel
<superretroworld> only portal and gears im into in the new era
<Meanwhile> Canadian_Brony: But somehow I doubt they look for that during jury duty.
<SuperBrony64_> You'll have to enter quarters into the new machines.
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile you don't understand the concept behind the saying, do you?
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile wait, yes you do.
<Canadian_Brony> troll
<Meanwhile> I do, which is why I understand it's silly.

<sonicandmario85> CCCP:BUT ITS NOT EVEN CHRISTMAS YET
<Reikim> I salute your internet fame.
<superretroworld> CCCP: i wish for more ponies
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03If only he were here...
<CCCP> sonicandmario85 But it is begining to look alot like christmas
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:its hotter than shit here
<mitamaking> So can you beat this mode?
<CCCP> superretroworld you shal get, A G3 Scootaloo
<Reikim> otakon's logged in but he's ignoring us.
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim I've been here for 5 months and I would've thought his obbsession with kicks should've been in the Annual Tom Awards!
<CCCP> sonicandmario85 come on get with the Holiday spirit!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14thanks Shizuka <3
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking yes. The bots aren't endless
<P4ngya> what am i watching 0.o
<Reikim> Shipping him should've been, but nah, that one got axed.
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:not even december yet
<superretroworld> CCCP: NOOOOOOOOOOOO 6_9
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim forgot about that one
<Malk> Admin/Mod most kicks award goes too........
<kirz|art> Canadian_Brony, it was considered, but we wanted to stay away from memes centered around individual people
<CCCP> Jingle Bells
<CCCP> !Jingle Bells!
<Reikim> He would've won, though.
<Shizuka> 13anypony recognize the tune?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...sounds kinda familiar
<mitamaking> I don't think otakon could beat Shoo be doo
<Canadian_Brony> kirz|art I still get a chuckle from it being considered.
<Sumica> 00,10is it the sound of one hand claping?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Through the Fire and Flames?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14almost wanna say something from Alice in Chains
<CCCP> oh gawd i love christmas!!! C:
<Flootahshy> Sounds like something from DOOM.
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica . . . yes.
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:i love christmas but im just saying its not even here yet
<Shizuka> 13that was MAP25 doom 2
<CCCP> sonicandmario85 ITS HERE NOW!
<superretroworld> styx?
<Flootahshy> I KNEW IT!
<mitamaking> ded
<Reikim> The problem with trying to avoid memes centred on individuals is that this is an IRC and therefore the majority of memes will be based on individuals. Meanwhile's moustache, otakon's kicks/ships/potato/hobbitness, Shizu's noodle, and so on, and so forth.
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:no.....its not
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...Shizu's noodle?
<mitamaking> otakon's potato?
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo ban noodle
<Malk> MONKEYS
<Shizuka> 13scoots keep up
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ohhhhhhh
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking can't help you there
<Meanwhile> My moustache is a meme?
<Cypresswolf> what is the ota kick count total - is anyone keeping track?
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:are you on a diffrent planet where its christmas? its august here
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile O_______O
<Reikim> otakon's connection is legendarily bad. We like to say it runs through a potato.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry, I thought it was a communism term :S
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<CCCP> sonicandmario85 Forget Months!
<CCCP> their overrated
<kirz|art> so who's ready for GW2, and have any idea which server would be good to start on?
<CCCP> forget time too
<Reikim> But really, otakon's got the record for most memes per individual.
<mitamaking> CCCP: weeks though are awesome
<Canadian_Brony> speak of the devil I was kicked
<Canadian_Brony> dammit . . .
<Slenderman> 1 day, 20 hours, 11 minutes :$
<Reikim> I don't intend on buying it...
<mitamaking> Slenderman: till what?

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sorry, I was watching a clip of the turtleman before he actually went on TV. I almost cried because I was laughing so hard.

<Canadian_Brony> 'Mericans
*Slenderman quickly runs away
<Canadian_Brony> pfft
<Reikim|Writing> A girl asks him out - a girl he liked
<Reikim|Writing> And he turns her down to play Skyrim.
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: Man look at Japan with Christmas
<Kawaii_icybeauti> mitamaking: Yeah, valentine's wins the capitalism award. At least christmas is centered around religion.
<CCCP> Valentines day just makes me more lonely :'(
<Kandarihu> CCCP, Capitalism is tolerable when the government tolerates it.
<Flootahshy> Canadian_Brony: *gasp*
<kirz|art> ah, that one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I so remember when Christmas was about family, not buying.
<kirz|art> yeah...
<P4ngya> epic music for the final wave

<JRP> SuperBrony64: but
<Reikim|Writing> Don't pull a fluttercry, and nobody will mind.

<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's better than if we all were in north kore, so be thankful about the capitalism.

<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Take it easy on the caps lock.
<Slenderman> Ok then sonic!
<CCCP> Merry Christmas Kawi
<CCCP> Kawaii_icybeauti:*
<Dovah> Nittany_Discord: your that old?
*Slenderman let's CCCP have SCP-173
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord me too! 4 years ago I had christmas with my cousins. Now THAT was fun
<kirz|art> only girl I've ever really connected with I'm square in the friendzone right now
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Thank you?:S
<CCCP> Slenderman yey
<Slenderman> HAVE A BLOODY GOOD TIME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dovah: Sadly.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dovah: *you're Sorry, the grammar nazi urge is itching me...
<mitamaking> This seems pretty easy
<Slenderman> Oh god pun unintended
<Malk> Democracy is said to be the worst form of government
<Reikim|Writing> Hey, at least you're being put there.
<Cypresswolf> Is anyone bored of getting stuff for the holidays? been years since I made a list because I dont want anything - rarely ever use the things I get
<CriticKitten> Dayum
<Reikim|Writing> I'm currently stuck in friendzone because I'm a bloody coward.
<kirz|art> which is funny, because everyone she's dated since we've met has thought that I was sleeping with her while they were dating >.<
<Kandarihu> Kawaii_icybeauti, indeed. NoKo is pretty much an extreme example, but communism has ALWAYS resulted in dictatorships to one degree or another.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Malk: Except for the the rest.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Malk: But look at wat communism does to people.
<Malk> Except all the others that have tried
<Canadian_Brony> why doesn't anybody ever say "pun intended"?
<CriticKitten> You guys are MURDERING that tank ._.
<Reikim|Writing> ...
<Kandarihu> I really gotta restart my computer.
<mitamaking> Cypresswolf: I got a laptop for my birthday so no
*Reikim|Writing laughs
<Malk> Yep Nittany_Discord you got the quote
<Slenderman> Because the pun isn't intended
<Reikim|Writing> That's actually really funny.
<Canadian_Brony> *sigh*
<kirz|art> she's had 3 serious relationships in the time I've known her, all 3 thought it
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:look at SCP-173S face...
<Malk> Im going to try and join the server
<Kawaii_icybeauti> All i got for my birthday was "the essential aerosmith.
<mitamaking> That spy was a robot all along
*CCCP plants mistletoe everywhere
<Canadian_Brony> I got ravors and shaving cream last Christmas
<JRP> SuperBrony64: ?
<Reikim|Writing> Doesn't seem like a very secure friendzone, then. That or it's just males being customarily stupid, which...is normal.
<Dark_Horst> do i hear rob zombie? yes i do hear rob zombie
<Canadian_Brony> *razors
<Malk> My birthday is 4th July
<CCCP> so everypony MUST kiss
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: How Canadian
*Canadian_Brony looks up
<Kawaii_icybeauti> o.O
<kirz|art> not sure, we get a long very well and have what some of our other friends call "a wavelength"
<Meanwhile> I think you're overlooking the real question here Reikim.
<thelonepony> everypony must kiss!
*sonicandmario85 looks up and sees mistle toe
<Cypresswolf> maybe its just me - I have 5 others in my family and my parents get us at least 2 gifts each year, plus a few things from my Aunt & Uncle from Austin, & my Grandma - end up getting over a dozen things every year - more junk for the pile
<Reikim|Writing> Hm?
<Canadian_Brony> >.>
<Meanwhile> Which is of course
<sonicandmario85> oh god
<Canadian_Brony> <.<
<Meanwhile> WERE you sleeping with her kirz?
<sonicandmario85> RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<kirz|art> we just get jokes in the same way and think along the same lines
<Canadian_Brony> -_^
<kirz|art> nope :P
<sonicandmario85> *flees from the house*
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> HAX
<mitamaking> Did the game just restart?
<Meanwhile> Just checking~
<TheKoreanBrony1354> wha song is this
<AJIsAwesome> Beam me up, Scotty!

<Reikim|Writing> Hey
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking yeah, the round ended
<Reikim|Writing> You forgot the followup question.
<Canadian_Brony> *match
*Reikim|Writing leans in close
<thelonepony> hadokun
<mitamaking> Does it get harder?
<Reikim|Writing> Are you sure?
<kirz|art> lol
<AJIsAwesome> DAT PYRO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fluttercry turned a girl down for Skyrim? I guess it depends on if he liked her or not.
<Reikim|Writing> He liked her.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> why aren't you seeing that twisted fantasy world?
<Cypresswolf> and then my birthday is 2 months after Christmas - so more stuff I dont need
<mitamaking> U see Meanwhile and Shizuka, who else is in there
<Reikim|Writing> Apparently he'd liked her for a while.
<mitamaking> *I
<AJIsAwesome> Did Saturn ever get his plushie request worked out?
<Reikim|Writing> Launch date comes around, she asks him out, nope, Skyrim.
<Cypresswolf> Just buy me a steak dinner and I'm happy :)
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking depends on your game mode. Waves become increasingly difficult and maps each have set waves.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Mine is 3 months from christmas

<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Hello!

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica well, there's me-OH! Do you mean in "Spectator"?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh his TF2 server otakon.

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica yeah, I'm not spectating
<IshInsertRandomNick> CCCP otakon and his mcnuggies are also not acceptable presents
<otakon> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not here. There's no sane reason why we would kick idle people in chat.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm watching the stream, though
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: besides them just clogging up the chat when they NEVER EVER EVER TALK?
<Canadian_Brony> Crawket!
<kirzstryfe> kick all the idle!

<Chrysalis> besides im still debating on whether to commision wrek before i decide any other commissions
<Kandarihu> Ah, starting over from the beginning, I see.
<tSparx> oh no, it's dubbed :/
<FusRohYAY_87> Love this anime
<Dovah> tSparx: thats not a good thing?
<MALK> dubbed isnt bad but not as good as subbed
<tSparx> Dovah : Much prefer subbed
<FusRohYAY_87> soooooooooo MUCH! :)
<tSparx> Dovah : Japanese voice actors >>>>> English ones
<Dovah> tSparx: seems odd as you spend more time reading what is said and not looking at the actual show
<tSparx> That's compounded by the fact that I'm not quite as intimate with Japanese ;D
<Sumica> 00,10this is one of the few where subbed is just as good imo
<tSparx> Dovah: It works out, trust me.
<Sumica> 00,10as dubed that is
<Dovah> Hellsing VA > everything
<Sumica> 00,10also this is a complex show so english helps
<FusRohYAY_87> on my bucket list to visit TOKYO
<Bunny_Striker> hotty hot hot
<tSparx> Sumica : Is it more complex than Evangelion?
<Buytoast> oh hey inuyasha
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: /)
<tSparx> (I recognize that's kinda subjective)
<Buytoast> i haven't seen this in years
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: (\
<MASF123> Tokyo?
<AdamTheDuck> Evangelion = total mind fuck :D
<Sumica> 00,10complex yes but unlike eva it's all explaned
<Sumica> 00,10eva is comples caye noting is explained
<FusRohYAY_87> AdamTheDuck: Indeed
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica: Yes but that's the fun in interpreting what you think just happened
<MASF123> I thought Paranoia was a mind fuck show or FLCL
<Bunny_Striker> time paradox = BRAIN CANCER MIND FUCKERY
<Buytoast> Paranoia Agenet is the one with little slugger right?
<tSparx> Samica : Is that your client's beep I'm hearing?
<MASF123> Yes the boy with the golden bat
<FusRohYAY_87> the best Endng was the Code GEass Ending and Whether or not Lelouch Lived or not
<FusRohYAY_87> still debated today
<AdamTheDuck> True, I never got that ending
<Sumica> 00,10yeah tSparx
<Dovah> FusRohYAY_87: epic spoiler alert?
<AdamTheDuck> understood I should say
<FusRohYAY_87> Dovah: ah it seems so, no pun intended
<tSparx> Dovah : I was gonna say something, but then I realized that "Lelouch is either alive or dead at the end of the story" isn't a big story
<MALK> I demand a pay raise
<Dovah> fuck... brb I cant see shit...

<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321: Key word is 'should'. Let future TheRandomkid321 deal with the problem and let present TheRandomkid321 have fun :D
<tSparx> Dovah: Couldn't just not meet people from the internet IRL?
<Dovah> tSparx: then you wouldnt be able to go to cons
<AdamTheDuck> Anyway, future TheRandomkid321 will be blaming past TheRandomkid321 so it won't affect present TheRandomkid321.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck *ellipsis*

<tSparx> No it's like 2:30am, haha.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat 2nd option :D
<AdamTheDuck> "Oh.
<AdamTheDuck> "
<Polydunami> Oh. Then I don't think it's quite correct to wish someone... "Kon'nichiwa" at that time :P
<Sabershy> It is 12:30 Am. Do you know where your children are?
<Polydunami> I have no children.
<Polydunami> Yet.
<Sabershy> I don't know what I felt like saying that.
<Sabershy> *why not what
<Magical_Pablez94> ...... I see that it's kinda dead here too....
<tSparx> Polydunami: I was under the impression that Konnichiwa could be used at any time of day. I recognize there might be a better word, but.
<somepony_else> i don't have any children. and if i had, they'd be at school oder kindergarten, since it's 9.40 am over here
<Sabershy> Confound these time zomes.
<Polydunami> I was told that it was to mean "good afternoon" or something
<Sabershy> *zones
<Polydunami> Maybe it was "good day"
<tSparx> Polydunami: I'm pretty sure it means "Good day," and is a general hello. There are several more though, haha, and the most general would be moshi-moshi
<Polydunami> Oh.
<tSparx> somepony_else: Bist du Deustcher?
<somepony_else> jepp
<tSparx> Deutscher*
<Sabershy> Konichiwa: "Good Afternoon"
