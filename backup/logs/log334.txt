*Ingwaz|Laptop shudders
<Drake> 04D:
<Drake> 04That sucks!
<Artemis> INORITE

<Fleur> the end is neigh?
<Lasharus> Thank you Ingwaz|Laptop.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> you're better off not seing it
<Drake> 04Well I got a haircut before we met
<Fleur> that makes me want to see it

<TOY_PON3> Ingwaz: thanks for reminding me about it
<Artemis> lmao
<Ingwaz|Laptop> you're welcome TOY_PON3

<Ingwaz|Laptop> trys*
<Fleur> gore or 34?
<TopHat> I love you
<TOY_PON3> gore
<Fleur> ah
<Ingwaz|Laptop> its not even actually gore, its just images made to look very very spooky

<TOY_PON3> Fleur: Just see it
<TopHat> sure

<Fleur> what comic?
<SilverSonic> ive had poofy hair
<Ingwaz|Laptop> and i dont necessarily get spooked easy, i watched the entire higurashi no naku koro ni series and thoroughly enjoyed it
<SilverSonic> some called me a mushroom head
<CupcakeWarrior> I never liked horror movies
<Shizuka> 13BOO
<TOY_PON3> yay for Higurashi
<Lasharus> I'm a pansy, when all is said and done, so I tend to avoid horror and similar.
<Phase4> most 'scary' games are actualy just starteling, havent played an actualy scary game yet
<Lasharus> EEK!
<otakon> hiya Shizuka
<Artemis> haha
<Artemis> well
*Fleur drags Shizuka into her invite only snuggle pile
<Artemis> you might have a big head
<CupcakeWarrior> Higurashi is not that scary
<Shizuka> 13did you see me did you see me i didn't do completely terrible <3
<otakon> well, this is definitely a startle comic
<Phase4> like what Shizuka, unexpected but not at all scary. allso hi Shizuka
<Artemis> that grows
<ValtheJean> 2,14 alright everypony
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Phase4: its more of a "i'll make you not sleep tonight game because of what may be in the corner in your dark room"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hope you enjoyed
<otakon> The Korean jumpscare comic
<TOY_PON3> Shizuka: you're still a pro to me :)

<otakon> yeah
<TOY_PON3> otakon: that was creepy butt fun
<Phase4> otakon: i just clicked your link.......
<otakon> just that one time

<CupcakeWarrior> creepy butt fun is best butt fun

<Phase4> holy crap that was startling, but a fairly impressive bit of javascript
<otakon> or I should have pm'd Fleur with it
<otakon> yeah, first time I saw it I had to fight back a "OH SHIT!"
<TOY_PON3> :D
<TopHat> #Scary_Videos
<otakon> I jumped in my seat, mute. Because it was 1 AM
<Fleur> well, Im not going to be taking any horror movie sugestions from otakon. :\

<Midnight_Tempest> of course they arent scary... they're just startling
<Shizuka> 13hey

<Fleur> money's love ponies
<TOY_PON3> ^
<TopHat> fine
<CupcakeWarrior> Where would a pony carry that free money?
<Midnight_Tempest> in their mane?
<TOY_PON3> mane money
<Midnight_Tempest> well... they do have saddlebags so that works too
<Fleur> they would keep it where pinkie pie keeps her schedule
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Phase4> otakon: wow, that thing you linked to uses ALOT of code and an invisible flash embed to do that scrolling
<TopHat> With saddlebags full of moneeeeeeey
<TopHat> mr krabs is a brony
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<TOY_PON3> squidward is best brony
<Fleur> mr krabs has crabs
<Phase4> 23373 lines of javascript after going though jsbeautify
<otakon> Phase4: I figured as much, the thing that freaked me out was that it basically locks your browser so you can't scroll up. At least I remember that I was frantically tried to close it the first time I watched it.
<Fleur> Lol
<Phase4> otakon: well it continiously sets position, you can scroll but it resets it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wait...it locks your browser?
<Phase4> i see the chat
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because I was able to scroll up...
<TOY_PON3> dat chat
<otakon> well
<Fleur> I scrolled up
<otakon> for a second
<Phase4> ValtheJean: it might on some browsers, not on firefox though
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey its the chat!
<otakon> it did it to me at least
<Phase4> it did stay locked for a second
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I used firefox =/
<Fleur> I use firefox
<otakon> me too
<Phase4> firefox is best browser
<otakon> but it kind of locked mine
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey its the time!
<Fleur> didnt lock mine
*TOY_PON3 uses Google Chrome
<TOY_PON3> ._.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmm...chat on stream? I must take this time to say something memorable which someponies will screencap!
<Fleur> and didnt scare me either
<Phase4> it does kinda, what suprises me is the volume of code
<otakon> well goodie for you two!
<otakon> argh
<Phase4> PONIES!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmmm
<otakon> Flibbity Gibber!

<ValtheJean> 2,14 Toilet water is not an appropriate substitute for steaming vegetables?
<Fleur> I dont giggle at ghosts
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey the smilies dont show up on the screen
<Fleur> I just ignore them
<TOY_PON3> Fleur: Hmmm seems legit
<TopHat> I CAN SEE WORDS
<Phase4> i just tried to pastebin the js they used but its larger than 500kb
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Quick everypony! Watch the stream carefully, one letter of each word is used to create a hidden message!
<Ingwaz|Laptop> oh...apparently my brain just shut itself off, thinking about skyrim for a second, go to type in "facebook.com" start typing "fus" before i catch myself
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see if you can decode it!
<Phase4> ValtheJean: if one wants to be technical it is, boiling it should kill the bacteria, but ew

<Phase4> ScootaChicken: you might be a brony
<ScootaChicken> he made me miss Vi's show ;___;
<Phase4> :(
<Phase4> but does he realy deserve hate?
<ScootaChicken> yeah
<Hydrazine> Phase4: europe, netherlands
<ScootaChicken> there's many reasons why he deserves hate outside of that reason
<ScootaChicken> none of which I really want to go into
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/ae827b611ffe5ba2034f104e824b8492/46594%20-%20confused%20gilda%20griffon%20happy%20hug%20let_go_of_your_hate%20macro%20pinkie_pie%20reaction_face%20reaction_image%20smile.jpg
<ScootaChicken> actually he probably doesn't deserve hate, just abhorrence
<Phase4> i would have shortend the link but aparently my extention broke
<ScootaChicken> dohoho
<ScootaChicken> fine, I'll tolerate him
<ScootaChicken> mfw I log into facebook and 4 notifcations

<ScootaChicken> what recording Phase4?
<Phase4> ScootaChicken: www.youtu.be/mHiRC_sNX4w
<ScootaChicken> y'know Phase4, I genuinely would have loved to have seen a recording of the chat reactions to Derpy in the mane chat
<ScootaChicken> the famous video is just of the Pinkie Pie room
<Phase4> yeah, i;m thinking of doing more
<Phase4> commented on the other guy's video, he might switch to mane chat. dont realy want to do two recordings of the mane room
<Phase4> allso i'm definantly removing the scroll bar next time
<Phase4> if i can get chatlogs i could recreate the mane chat
<ScootaChicken> you could ask Shizuka
<ScootaChicken> anyway I'm off to lunch
<ScootaChicken> see you Phase4 and anyone else
<Phase4> ;ater ScootaChicken
<Phase4> later'
<Jim> bai ScootaChicken

<HeavyMetalDash> those things are awesome
<Jim> What are you trying to draw?
<Dashie_Dashie> Vinyl Scratch Dj-ing
<Jim> You could try drawing by hand, not sure if that's harder though
<Dashie_Dashie> meh...
<Dashie_Dashie> who knows.
<Jim> I wish I could draw, but it always ends up like one of those childrens drawings
<arrowtobroknee> I just saw an ad for pinkie's friendship express on Nick-UK. now
<Phase4> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/derpy.xpi this works good and proper now, minus bugs caused by the slowness of derpy.me

<Simon2> oh
<Phase4> it has a different content script system to firefox, arguably better, but it keeps throwing permission errors for seemingly no reason

<DaniilScit|DWARF> Plutonia Exprement?
<DaniilScit|DWARF> OLOLO ITS CRAZY
<arrowtobroknee> why do they call it a minigun?
<arrowtobroknee> srsly
<Nyria> Google it~
<Jim> Because 'tis mini if you're a heavy
<Cypresswolf> Sorry, I think Discord was this morning. Its super squeezy cider and best night ever in an hour or so
<Dashie_Dashie> it's a gatlin gun now.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Now, this is a REAL MAN'S FPS
<arrowtobroknee> Sonic rainboom. Should watch?
<arrowtobroknee> *yay*
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait for this weeks RD episode :>
<Jim> But in all seriousnes arrowtobroknee : it's called mini because it's quite small compared to guns with similar fireing mechanisms
<Dashie_Dashie> i'm prepared for DAWWWWW
<arrowtobroknee> ok then
<Simon_> Weird disconnections lol
<Ictiv> arrowtobroknee: Also becasue MiniCannon just sounds silly
<arrowtobroknee> watching on TV feels weird
<Dashie_Dashie> what, MLP?
<arrowtobroknee> yes
<arrowtobroknee> too used to internet
<Globetrotter> MiniCannon sounds awesome.
<Dashie_Dashie> I have my xbox with youtube and both Seasons of MLP playlists.
<Ictiv> MiniCannon sounds liek a toy
<Dashie_Dashie> that's how I first watched it.
<Ictiv> like*
<Ictiv> Then again... MiniOrbitalLaserBaseOfExtremeApocalypse...
<Dashie_Dashie> MMMH
<arrowtobroknee> too long
<Cypresswolf> I miss these old graphics. I want to restore one of those early 90's computers to operate like new.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Better than CoD
<arrowtobroknee> ^truth
<Globetrotter> It's not hard to beat CoD
<Dashie_Dashie> Anything > CoD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Very true
<Globetrotter> So true.
<arrowtobroknee> Played it once, sucked at it.
<Ictiv> Actually... I've heard legends of a mystical game
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> same
<Ictiv> a game so bad that it is... NOT worse than CoD
<HeavyMetalDash> no
<arrowtobroknee> superman 64?
<HeavyMetalDash> it isn't true!
<Ictiv> I know, it sounds scary
<Dashie_Dashie> Half-life/any valve FPS are my first favorites
<Dashie_Dashie> Seconds are mmorpgs or RTS
<Dashie_Dashie> LoL anyone :>?
<Globetrotter> Don't play it
<Jim> I've played it before
<Nyria> Well, it's an okay game if you get practice at it... (not including the singleplayer story) But I'm just tired of people calling them selves MLG and boasting about it all the time~
<Ictiv> Since games are the talk again. i have a question I asked a bazillion time but didn't get a single answer to:
<Jim> didn't like the competition element of it
<Ictiv> What's up with Assassin's Creed Revelations?
<Ictiv> Did it come out?
<Ictiv> Did it not?
<Ictiv> No one talks about it!
<Dashie_Dashie> It came out here.
<Dashie_Dashie> in the US
<Jim> Dunno, haven't played assasin's creed since the first game came out
<Cypresswolf> I didnt hear about half life as a kid, I only heard about the game series when 2 came out. I was too busy with Myst during those years
<Dashie_Dashie> last AC I've play was brotherhood
<Nyria> What's up~ The simulated sky?~
*Ictiv slaps Nyria about with a bi.... No
<DaniilScit|DWARF> How you can play in this? ITS TOO HARD
<Dismo> Anyone here have PSN?
*Ictiv slaps Bronyriffic around a bit with a large trout.
<Ictiv> Yes
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Xbox LIVE here
<Nyria> ...
*Kira_Pony_Yamato loads Forza Motorsport 4
<Wrek> 05DaniilScit|DWARF, you better be joking
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<arrowtobroknee> It's not hard, you're just bad at it
<Nyria> Well~ I'm looking it up Ictiv~
<Jim> Games these days are generaly too easy
<HeavyMetalDash> Only real bawses can play doom
<HeavyMetalDash> liek a baws
<Nyria> Ictiv: Have fun ^^: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Revelations
<Globetrotter> Anyone know where the anti-acta petition on thge uk gov website its?
<arrowtobroknee> and SMB: lost levels
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Its hard for me... I dont know why,maybe because my hands growing from ass?
<arrowtobroknee> sounds painful
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, lost levels
<Cypresswolf> Ill look that up for you, Globetrotter
<arrowtobroknee> My TV is 12 years old, which would explain why ponies sound different.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Jim> that might be the explaination
<Dashie_Dashie> hmm..
<Dashie_Dashie> I may be subjected to getting a RD tattoo.
<Sumica> 00,10ho ffffff
<Dashie_Dashie> >.>
<arrowtobroknee> anyone ever played super meat boy?
<arrowtobroknee> or meat boy flash?
<Cypresswolf> oh, uk site... Sorry, I dont know where that is. I was thinking Sopa.
<HeavyMetalDash> I also want a permanent Rainbow dash
<Jim> I haven'y played it arrowtobroknee but I have seen it been played
<Globetrotter> I found it but thanks anyway, Cypresswolf
<arrowtobroknee> meat boy is brilliantly hard. I got stuck on the hell chapter
<Sumica> 00,10wrek mega charge
<arrowtobroknee> I just realised american TV has more ad breaks than UK TV
<Cypresswolf> like the layout of that level
<Jim> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results - Einstein
<Dashie_Dashie> I wish I was 200x smarter than steven hawkings, I'd create an interdimensional portal rift that lead to equestria.
<Dashie_Dashie> but that's just me.. o_o
<Jim> Dashie_Dashie: I would give you all my money if you did! :D
<Dismo> Silly, Jim, Doc Browns dog never talked. :3
<Cypresswolf> Who's to say Equestria doesnt already exist somewhere in the universe? :)
<arrowtobroknee> my little dahsie?
<arrowtobroknee> *dahsie
<arrowtobroknee> *dashie
<Dismo> This chat.
<arrowtobroknee> rainbows are spicy
<Dashie_Dashie> Cypresswolf: I agree.
<Dashie_Dashie> the universe is never ending, who's to say that any idea we come up with isn't floating around somewhere in the universe
<Dashie_Dashie> if not an alternate universe
<Nyria> Wrek can do it~!
<arrowtobroknee> rarity was an alicorn for half an episode, yet she did nothing.
<Nyria> yay~!
<Jim> Way to go
<Cypresswolf> theory: all of the ideas people have of another plane of existence maybe a connection to a real place somewhere in this universe. Can't prove right or wrong if none of us have explored outside the solar system :P
<Dashie_Dashie> right?
<Nyria> I've thought of sooo many werid things~
<arrowtobroknee> rainbow dash ALWAYS dresses in style
<Nyria> weird*
<Dismo> Yeah, how does that work, Luna is so much smaller then Molestia, Do they keep growing even after 1000 years?
<HeavyMetalDash> I have a fic going with a theory similar to that one as one of it's plotpoints
<otakon> well
<Dashie_Dashie> what if an alien invasion was just ponies from Equestria?
<otakon> Luna is the younger sister right?
<Dashie_Dashie> immorethanokwith.jpg
<otakon> wouldn't she be smaller?
<Cypresswolf> I would welcome out new pony overlords :)
<otakon> yeah
<arrowtobroknee> are the sister's ages ever mentioned?
<otakon> nope not really
<Dashie_Dashie> I smell a look back into the past episode.
<otakon> but they're at LEAST a 1000 years apiece
<otakon> well
<otakon> Tia is probably at least 1500
<arrowtobroknee> we still don't know what happened on the moon
<otakon> easy enough
<arrowtobroknee> luna may have been sleeping
<otakon> NMM got sealed inside the moon
<Jim> It's magic, I ain't got to explain anything
<otakon> he's how I see it
<Dashie_Dashie> mobs, mobs everywhere
<arrowtobroknee> remember: over analysis keeps the internet intelligent.
<otakon> When Luna transformed into NMM, she sinced being Luna at that moment.
<otakon> She was kind of stasis locked
<Cypresswolf> If an alien invasion were equestrian ponies, would they be horrified at our treatment to horses Earth has? I've seen Planet of the Apes, that scenario doesnt end well
<arrowtobroknee> lolwiut#
<otakon> that's why when NMM was purged of all of that jealousy and anger
<Nyria> Yes~ I don't think they would like it~
<otakon> we got a little Luna
<otakon> at first
<arrowtobroknee> planet of the apes but ponified?
<arrowtobroknee> lyra would be so happy
<Ingwaz> i imagine that we could explain it to the ponies Cypresswolf
<Dashie_Dashie> get your hooves off of my you damn dirty pony!
<Dashie_Dashie> jk we can hug.
<Jim> ^mindreader
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Use the BFG, if you have it, that is
<Dashie_Dashie> :3
<arrowtobroknee> not seen the BFG yet, I think he hasn't got that far
<Dashie_Dashie> he would use his BFG, he doesn't have any cell ammunition
<Ingwaz> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/2176304_460s.jpg
<Dashie_Dashie> he has the BFG
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Well, that's why I added the "if you have it" at the end
<Nyria> hehe Ingwaz~
<Sumica> 00,10no ammo
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> What WAD is this...
<Jim> Ingwaz: I'll have to correct you: >turn up speakers to 11 >enjoy

<Fazana> Those guys are REALLY annoying
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> <- has Twilight Sparkle on the sde of his 2009 Ford Focus RS in Forza Motorsport 4

<Fazana> Berserker, that's Quaddamage no?
<Fazana> Or dual
<Globetrotter> lots
<otakon> hmm
<Fazana> *Can't remember*
<Fazana> I can only Remember quake
<otakon> I always preferred the tried and true sword and board fighter
<Fazana> Which was Quad Damage
<Globetrotter> Monks are hilarious
<Fazana> Goslap the door won't help
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Doom beats all modern FPS games easily
<Globetrotter> Lookatmeimrunningreallyfastyoucan'tgetmehahahaha
<otakon> yeah
<Fazana> Doom and quake are very arguable
<arrowtobroknee> did doom ever have multiplayer?
<ekips> afk for a bit, parents calling :D
<otakon> if only it didn't looke like drek
*Nyria catches Globetrotter~
<Nyria> Caught you~
<otakon> also, brb need coffee
*Globetrotter stops drops and rolls
<Fazana> I want a remake of the 3 games, and more
<otakon> well
<Fazana> Not for the graphics
<otakon> I would LOVE a remake for Doom
<Fazana> But for the gameplay, as it would be much easier nowadays
<Wrek> 05things is
<otakon> using new graphics and such
<Globetrotter> I thought DOOM 3 was supposed to be DOOM 1 but flashy
<otakon> yeah
<Fazana> It basically was.
<Jim> Well, Doom is a classic, they would probably ruin it by trying to remake it
<Wrek> 05cant change the gameplay
<otakon> Doom 3 was more or less Doom
<Wrek> 05at all
<arrowtobroknee> they could do what happened with mega man 9 and 10
<otakon> Wrek: enope you can't or it's not Doom
<Fazana> They can leave all the same, but mouselook would be really epic
<Globetrotter> Which pony, aside from viny Fazana, should I draw. I'm trying to get better.
<otakon> at the very least I'd like to see some high res textures in this!
<arrowtobroknee> 8-bit graphics and difficulty on modern console download
<Fazana> Plasma gun :D
<Sumica> 00,10hey wrek try the zerker on them
<otakon> inb4 dead
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> zerker should work

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> The pegasi seemed to have a militaristic (spelling?) background in the Holiday episode (can't rememeber the title at the moment)
<ekips> the description of the video says, that it is a joke and he does not really care about mlp
<Nyria> Woah, as soon as I clicked that youtube link the song "Proud to be a brony" Just went on~
<Dashie_Dashie> people said he was an untouchable brony hater.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'll put test to that claim.
<arrowtobroknee> don't feed the troll

<Dashie_Dashie> My theroy is, if you hate something you MUST give a logical explanation on why.
<ekips> Quin: stop feeding the hatred :O
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I agree, Dashie_Dashie
<arrowtobroknee> just let R19 deal with the haters
<ofna01> we dont hate him

<HeavyMetalDash> this guy is hillarious
<ofna01> who
<Dashie_Dashie> ofna01: I almost cried laughing when that guy said ponies ruins lives.
<ofna01> ydfgjsfJSAGNsang

<ofna01> he needs to go to a mental ward
<Critchley> send him to the moon
<Fazana> Take him to Nurse Redheart
<Quin> to thw mooooooooooon!
<Fazana> Or take him to Trollestia, to send him to the moon for 10k years
<Nyria> He's another troll~ Just don't bother with him if you can manage~
<Dashie_Dashie> My macintosh vid almost has 100 views
*Dashie_Dashie yay~
<HeavyMetalDash> I like how he thinks us bronies will attack poeple who aren't bronies for not being bronies
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Hey,take the KillDDoSers too,these parasprites are cool...
<Critchley> i just read rainbow factory :S
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I hate SUVs and the people that drive them, because a teenager driving his parent's SUV was doing double the speed limit in a school zone, and instead of slowing down for a turn, swerved into oncoming traffic, hitting my girlfriend's car head on, eventually she died due to her injures... (
<HeavyMetalDash> like seriously?
<ekips> Critchley: oh god why?
<Nyria> Critchley: Oh... Are you okay my friend?~
<Fazana> Genuine?
<Critchley> xD fine lol

<Critchley> Because the song is cool xD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Well,what really pisses me off is the fact that the kid got off with no more than a slap on the wrist, because mommy and daddy bailed his ass out
<ofna01> i feel ya man
<ofna01> my best friend died the same way
<Fazana> So, basically syaing, he got away with Murder?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I was going to ask her to marry me that day too.
<ofna01> kira

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Esentially, yes
<Dashie_Dashie> Stuff like that makes me want to go to law school, people representing the victums of a case are always tried with unfairness.
<Dashie_Dashie> I.E. guy murders someones child, gets 15 years with probation.
<Fazana> We plan to get Carbon fibre when we can afford it

<Cypresswolf> Next Generation Star Trek?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> No...
<arrowtobroknee> voygear
<Jim> Voyager
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I guess pleasure isn't too bad, but still creepy
<arrowtobroknee> 70,000 isn't THAT far
<MirrorImage> arrowtobroknee - at Warp 9, i believe they calculated a travel time of... 100 years to get back
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Hitting on sexy alien women
<DubZbrony> ok, thats why i havent seen this Episode before oO
<arrowtobroknee> It's just that today's telescopes can see 100,000+ light years way
<arrowtobroknee> and this is 300 yrs ahead of us
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> inb4 secks with alien women
<arrowtobroknee> he does that in a later episode
<MirrorImage> arrowtobroknee - yes, but remember that we see that light AFTER it has traveled for 100,000 years
<Altair> >going through old bookmarks
<MirrorImage> so that's us looking back in time, essentially
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Exactly
<Altair> >find a rough beta edition of HoR
<Altair> >hnnng
<Cypresswolf> How much longer until science reaches that level of tech? Mind, we should have had flying cars by now
<arrowtobroknee> back to the future is the best documentary ever made
<Shizuka> 13except flying cars has a whole lot of problems
<ofna01> hm
<Shizuka> 13you run out of fuel or collide midair, where do you go
<DubZbrony> Dont listen to her!!!, she just want Interprise for herself! argH!
<ofna01> emergency parachut's shizu
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Shizuka: down :3
<ofna01> if it falls a certain distance,the parachutes deploy
<arrowtobroknee> then you call upon the sea ponies
<Shizuka> 13and if you're not quite far enough above ground for them to deploy?
<Cypresswolf> yep. without a system to keep each vehicle from colliding and falling, its just trouble.
<ofna01> then it wont hurt you
<Shizuka> 13are you kidding?
<Hellspawn> new drivers licenses
<ofna01> if it fell more then 30 feet,they would deploy
<arrowtobroknee> cock blocked by an ensign
<Jim> falling 30 feet inside a car would hurt your face quite a bit though
<Shizuka> 13^
<Sumica> 00,1030ft is not enough time to deply a chute fully
<Shizuka> 13it's plenty of time to mess you up good though
<ofna01> well,thats why it has padded interiors
<ofna01> dont ask me im only 15 XD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Wait, wut?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Take technology by force.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> simple
<ofna01> ahem,gentlemen?
<Shizuka> 13you're still talking about multiple tons of car falling under the influence of gravity hitting this wonderfully immovable thing we call ground
<MirrorImage> Kira_Pony_Yamato - Prime Directive
<MirrorImage> it works both ways
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Screw the Prime Directive...
<Shizuka> 13that energy has to go somewhere, and your body is a pretty good outlet
<ofna01> i know
<Sumica> 00,10thats asuming they only hit ground on the way down
<ofna01> i need to go back to the drawing board
<Shizuka> 13that too
<ofna01> i make plans for stuff i design
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I wouldn't last long in Starfleet.
<Shizuka> 13plus there's the issue of traffic jams in 3d space
<arrowtobroknee> you got a few hundred years to develop
<ofna01> i doubt that shizu
<Cypresswolf> While floating down with a parachute, if youre still in the air highway (5th Element) + Shizuka's point, all that debris falling from greath heights onto the ground below....yikes
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> True
<kirzstryfe> 1,3off to work, have fun everypony :)

<Cypresswolf> Pecan Pie is best pie
<Altair> Wait, so I'm missing Star Trek? >_>
<MirrorImage> Picard Pie?
<arrowtobroknee> he also went bald during the war
<Shizuka> 13dat eyebrow raise
<Cypresswolf> And Im not just saying that because Im Texan *scrunch face*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I'd take it by force, but that's just me

<Sumica> 00,10hell my touch scran even works with my work gloves on.
<Cypresswolf> then Pyscho Twilight part 2 :P
<Shizuka> 13kindle's touch screen is about blocking light and checking where that happens
<pony_3545> :'(
<Jim> 20 minutes of power left? Clock is ticking Twilight. Clock. is. TICKING!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ponies + Star Trek = ???
<Hellspawn> they could use their snouts
<Shizuka> 13some others i think work by measuring your finger's conductivity
<Shizuka> 13but given a big enough area ponies could operate touchscreens with just their hooves
<arrowtobroknee> there were loads of star trek x ponies stuff after discord = Q
<Sumica> 00,10I have seen a pony+trek fic
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Figures..

*Research_Pony shudders and clamps down on something firm and sturdy.
<Cavy> Research, you got that link, correct?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> uber lllaaagggg
<Research_Pony> Yes, but I try to avoid dark stories.
<Cavy> Ah.
<Cavy> Just incase.
<Jim> You could say that picture *Puts on sunglasses* Is not safe for work (geddit?)
<Research_Pony> No offence to you, just a preference as it is harder to get out of sadness than it is to get in.
<Research_Pony> For me.
<arrowtobroknee> yes, NFSW
<Cavy> I gotcha.
<Yellowquiet> Jim what is your fav pony
<Dken2021> mfw I discovered restoring tabs on firefox
<Jim> I can't surely pick a favourite, I love all of them
<Cavy> I just tend to, as a writer, like to give the main character a bit of redemption so it doesn't seem as if it ends in tragedy.
<Yellowquiet> ;D
<Cavy> Speaking of Redemption..
<arrowtobroknee> They want her blood
<Cavy> I need to play some Red Dead.
<Sumica> 00,10did you know FF can even do that after you closed it fully Dken2021
<Shizuka> 13killing a firefox process usually triggers restore
*Research_Pony checks his newsfeed as it pops upa nd snickers.
<Dken2021> and now I question why I switched from it to chrome
<Research_Pony> "Irony Alert: Bus Crashes Into Live Press Conference About Workplace Safety" http://www.theblaze.com/stories/irony-alert-bus-crashes-into-live-press-conference-about-workplace-safety/

<MirrorImage> "we?"
<MirrorImage> oh, right, her
<Cypresswolf> party's over for, got a delivery call. later
<Shizuka> 13now... where is dcd... i must ask if it's actually possible to be pricked with a needle und dead the next second
<Yellowquiet> i m so silly i just closed the bronystate tab XD
<arrowtobroknee> silly filly
<Shizuka> 13DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
<arrowtobroknee> OMGWTFBBQ
<Sumica> 00,10It's that deadly coral toxin
<Jim> Dun dun dun, I didn't understand
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Shizuka: Only if it's a vaccine filled with poison O__O
<SomeOtherGuy> deadly, deadly, poison
<arrowtobroknee> dat cardassia
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But actually, you can be dead the next second with poison
<Sumica> 00,10hills you before you feal the pain.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why did you hill him?
<Shizuka> 13people die when they are hilled
<Shizuka> 13und need years of therapy
<Jim> I hate when I get hilled
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Most biological poison works to inhibit Ca2+ ion channels, which regulate muscle control throughout the body.
<Sumica> 00,10must suck to be the king of the hill then
<DashWithRainbows> Do ho
<arrowtobroknee> I hilled a mountain
<derpy_pony> not very diplomatic
<Jim> She's Francis
<Shizuka> 13ah sell voyager und voyager accessories
<Jim> "I don't like...stuff.."
<arrowtobroknee> you can't handle the truth!
<Midnight_Tempest> voyager <3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thus various poisons will kill you in a number of ways.
<Tovler> Darn, it's too late to make a Kim Cardassian pun.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Voyager = pwnage
<Sumica> 00,10hand wave mission
<MirrorImage> Tovler - it's an overdone joke at this point
<Shizuka> 13janeway must have thought this was one of those "everything goes wrong" missions
<Jim> "Yep, that's a hole"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Actually, lethal injections consist of a high concentration of Ca2+ to depolarize the cell and cause an action potential essnetially shutting down the body.
<arrowtobroknee> has anyone ponified seven of nine yet?
*LordCelestia 0,5has a sad today

<Research_Pony> not that other people be unhappy.
<IshBestPony|HamMane> Dexter was a brony before it was cool
<Vivix> I always deduced it as misery, the feeling, causes other misery
<MirrorImage> it's the idea that a sad person doesn't necessarily want to see some peppy and cheery person

<Sumica> 00,10Oh cool it has paul and Gram
<Pony_of_War> "This thread is huge, and it only started this, morning???"
<Research_Pony> Hah, meme reference
<Pony_of_War> The magic of ponies
<emantrollslayer> Sumica: that video is epic. Gotta love LRR
<Sumica> 00,10I like those guys from unskipable
<emantrollslayer> Sumica: all of their LRR videos are just brillant
<Jim> My little Bear: Friendship is Mauling
<emantrollslayer> Unskippable spawned from LRR's sucess
<emantrollslayer> "Is someone watching new generation"
<Phase4> YS! its loaded enough, i can watch it now
<Sumica> 00,10I have never heard of LRR
<Jim> Now with added naked ladies

<Research_Pony> The porn part was a meme reference
<Phase4> i meen last years
<emantrollslayer> Phase4: Yea kinda
*Phase4 forgets its 2012
<Phase4> matt knows how it is
<emantrollslayer> kroze saying pony glue made me die on the inside
<emantrollslayer> matt is best brony
<Pony_of_War> :) DISCORD!
<emantrollslayer> Ok I seriously gotta go
<emantrollslayer> bye everypony
<emantrollslayer> Porn, filthy dirty dirty porn....DEF not MLP
<Phase4> later emantrollslayer
<Pony_of_War> Why does pega-sis sound bad when it's said aloud?
<Pony_of_War> I don't get it
<Pony_of_War> :P
<emantrollslayer> its just a joke
<Research_Pony> It's a bad pun. By the way, is Tengen Toppa: Gurren Lagann good?
<Pony_of_War> but... I don't get it...
<Research_Pony> Brony is a good pun, Pegasis is a bad pun
<Pony_of_War> ahh
<Research_Pony> ...I could be wrong about the 'pun' part
<MirrorImage> i believe the term is portmandeau
<Phase4> reasearch!
<Phase4> for science!
<MirrorImage> or however that french "dew" is spelled
<Research_Pony> start with the reversal of 'bro' Yes, Portmandeau is right
<MirrorImage> but yeah, essentially it is a pun
<Research_Pony> Wait... Bro is a condension of 'brother' so Sis would be a reverse of Bro...
<MirrorImage> it's not necessarily a reversal as much as it is a pairing
<MirrorImage> Brother/Sister
<Research_Pony> Sis... Sis... hmmm...
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/v4ud8 WATCH
<Research_Pony> Brony came from 'Bro-Pony' which could be read as 'Brother-Pony'
<MirrorImage> actually, i think it more originated from the /b/ application of Bro
<Sumica> 00,10hear I thought it came from /b/+pony
<Research_Pony> I'm not good with words...
<MirrorImage> a /b/rony
<Phase4> well that was an awesome video
<Pony_of_War> I used to be embarressed about being a brony, now I'm quite open about it :)
<MirrorImage> and pegasister originated after Brony became a separate entity from /b/
<Pony_of_War> Who would have though that ponies would be cooler and more awesome than "vampires"
<Research_Pony> And not so oversaturated?
<Phase4> so there are 4 anons in the chat....
<Dashie_Dashie> *ehem* 5
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Brony = Bro + Pony ^_^
<Phase4> oai SuperBrony64|AFK
<Research_Pony> one of the reasons why Skyward Sword won over Skyrim in the IGN poll
<Phase4> ohai'
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Ohai :3
<Sumica> 00,10Sb why are you not in class?
<Phase4> lol, look at eqd
<MirrorImage> who says he isn't?
<Saturn> 8,1BRONYSTATE!
<MirrorImage> i've surfed the web during class before
<Saturn> 8,1i need your opinion on something
<String_Shredder> hey everypony
<Jim> ohai Saturn
<MirrorImage> heck, i did it from the front row of my Business Law class before
<Jim> ohai String_Shredder
<Sumica> 00,10cut the red wire Saturn
<Pony_of_War> No allcaps...
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I am in class silly fillies
<Phase4> morning Saturn
<Saturn> 8,1karaoke <-- good idea or bad idea for a con event?
<Research_Pony> "Ponystate. Are you in good hooves?"
*Pony_of_War ish joking
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Good
<MirrorImage> Saturn - depends on the music selection
<Phase4> Saturn: pony karaoke can be a bad idea?
<Sumica> 00,10depends on who sings
*Saturn 8,1can see it being all kinds of non-fun
<Phase4> when did this happen?
<MirrorImage> that too
<String_Shredder> if i sing then good idea
*Sumica could not carry a tune to save his life
<Pony_of_War> sing parody songs - I need to Thu'um a Draugr (Moves like Jagger)
<Pony_of_War> :)
*Pony_of_War exploring a cave in Skyrim, looking for some random guy's helmet; wait I need to thu'um a dragur, I need to thu'um a dragur...

<Phase4> Diftraku: you there?
<Diftraku> Yar
*Globetrotter hugs Pony_of_War "FUS RO HUG"
<Pony_of_War> danke Globetrotter
<Phase4> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/derpy.xpi
<Globetrotter> Ayup everypony
<Phase4> turned out to be easied than i thought
<Pony_of_War> FUS RO yay!
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: what is it?
<Phase4> derpy.me button for firefox
<Globetrotter> Just drew lyra and bonbon
*Pony_of_War 's Animal Allegiance Thu'um has been modified to "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!!!"
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/FxGyg for example
*Natleyn hugs LunaTheBeloved
<Globetrotter> Is there any suitable 4th wall pinkie hanging from the ceiling pics anywhere?
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Natleyn
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi there
<Phase4> morning LunaTheBeloved
<LunaTheBeloved> Afternoon Phase4
<Saturn> 8,1http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0yxN0ZnQug
<Saturn> 8,1oh dear, this is hilarious
<Jim> ^
<Jim> was thinking of that the entire song
<Globetrotter> hahahaha
<Phase4> Diftraku: if you click too fast your server emits 403 errors randomly, your rate limiting bugs out on cloudflare i think
<Pony_of_War> Flutterblush in the intro :)
<Pony_of_War> Dat innuendo
*Pony_of_War Fluttershy sleeps naked o.o
<Diftraku> Phase4: 403 is what it's supposed to give, afaik
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: you can do that with a bookmarklet
<Saturn> 8,1in fact, i think there's the code for that on the site
<Phase4> Saturn: eh, this war taught me more
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<Phase4> never heard of a bookmarklet either
<Phase4> i was waiting for someone to make that video
<Diftraku> Phase4: http://derpy.me/bookmarklet
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: go to http://du.cx and drag the duck picture to your bookmark bar (or just look at where the link points)
<Saturn> 8,1same idea
*Pony_of_War needs motivation to make My Little Pony: Remeber the Name
*Pony_of_War Remember*
*Phase4 turns his bookmark bar off
<Pony_of_War> I have most of the 2nd verse thought out in my head
<Phase4> thats a neat trick
*Research_Pony racks his brain
<Diftraku> The addon does work, not sure if it should redirect to the page (ie. work like the bookmarklet) or display the link somewhere in the popup
<Pony_of_War> "Got him out the dryer, he's hot" - Pinkie Pie getting ready for the gala - then a picture of Princess Luna when the "hot" part comes on :), Dat woona <3
<Phase4> '+escape(location.href)); seems so simple now i think about it
<Diftraku> Also, I was asked for right click -> Shorten with derpy.me functionality over on dA
<Phase4> Diftraku: the muffin should go bright then notify you if it worked or errored
<Phase4> on linux it uses notifyd, i'l just test it in windows
<Diftraku> It uses the same notifications that Firefox uses for notifying of updates
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: encodeURIComponent is better
<Pony_of_War> Does anypony remember, wait... The Pandorica part 2
<Pony_of_War> nevermind :P
<Pony_of_War> or maybe "Let's Kill Hitler"
*Pony_of_War is trying to think of when 11th doctor had on the tux and was "rockin' the booth"
<Sumica> 00,10You cant kill Hitler, tvtrops says so
<Pony_of_War> Go back in time to kill Hitler, accidentally save hitler's life
<Pony_of_War> :P
<Pony_of_War> O.O
<Phase4> Saturn: i found that but it seems to escape more than is needed, but i was programing at 00:00 when stuff like that matters for some reason
<Pony_of_War> I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING!
<Pony_of_War> My friend (teh beautiful awesome one, :)) has a friend named Mel
<Pony_of_War> Mel - Melody
<Diftraku> Phase4: If you could implement clientside rate limiting on the addon (1 link per minute) that'd tbe awesome
<Pony_of_War> (Well, melony, but close)
<Pony_of_War> Melody... pond...
<Pony_of_War> Timelord (lady?)
<Pony_of_War> :D
<Phase4> Diftraku: probably should, to fast and it errors with a '{}'
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: it works better when you're encoding a URI that has a URI in it
<Saturn> 8,1i.e. it's more universal for GET parameters
<Diftraku> Saturn: I tweaked my bookmarklet a bit, thanks :P
<Phase4> wow, it doesnt minify at all. just dumps source right into the xpi
<Pony_of_War> AMAZON! Y U SO GLITCHY???!
*Pony_of_War feels like watching some S6 of Doctor Whooves
<Phase4> virtualbox: y u stop shared clipboard
<Pony_of_War> I have a pro-bowl game to watch though
<Phase4> and naturaly i type '51948537' perfectly but misty;e 'http' as 'htp'
<Phase4> mitype'
<Pony_of_War> River Song is best female timelord
<fillyfillyy> Hey everypony just wanted to stop by for a bit and well say hi
<pony_8993> que e esto
<Jim> hai fillyfillyy

<Sumica> 00,10ah right
<fillyfillyy> be on at like 6ish till like 11
<Pony_of_War> "Welcome, we're going to kill you now"
<Sumica> 00,10At least it was't River phoenix
<Phase4> Saturn: i would prefer to use my addon to a bookmarklet, it dumps it right into the clipboard so i can keep going while it loads. plus the bookmarks bar looks silly
<Globetrotter> My 4th wall Pinkie Pie looks like an alien
<Jim> Globetrotter: Likt this? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpzit6MokN1r1bkuso1_400.jpg

<fluttershyfan158> TRUE!!
<RAWRity> Dken2021: Well, I've seen it described this way: It sticks closely to the Pokemon formula for games, but it's the formula perfected. battles are fast paced and the idle animations keep it from feeling like nothing's happening. The story is probably the best/most engrossing of the franchise, and the poke designs are a lot better than Gen 4 IMO
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02:P

<Yahooz> btw do you think that the makers meant to include that Fluttershy induendo?
<AlduinTheGreater> clearly as good as the impersonations on Cupcake Time

<Phase4> so it is that one
<otakon> well
<Morty> yeah I took that out
<otakon> I wouldn't go that far
