<Phase4> 00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_%28unit%29 << partial explination of magnets
<AdamTheDuck> Dem magnets
*Saturn 08,01smells science
<Saturn> 08,01i could give an explanation of magnets
<Saturn> 08,01depending on how in-depth i go, it could take a good few hours
<Dark_Horst> you should make a weekly podcast. science with saturn
<AdamTheDuck> "Today's forecast: 70 percent chance of SCIENCE!" - Adam Savage
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, help me understand magnetic flux?
<Phase4> 00,02(kg*m^2)/(A*s^2) doesnt make sense to me
<BronyInstrumental> too much science is happening! GAH
*AdamTheDuck forsees a wall of text incoming from Saturn as he tries to explain magnets
<Phase4> 00,02aparently magnets really are just that wierd
<AdamTheDuck> They're like... magic! 6_9
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, its the seconds i dont get
<BronyInstrumental> i'll understand when i get to learning that kind of science. probably not in the school year i'm in now
<Jmo> Oh my god Series 7 next month ;~;
<BronyInstrumental> TV, Y U SO SUPERFLOUS?
<Phase4> 00,02i think the real problem is i cant visualize magnetic flux
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, Welcome, we're doing science
<Phase4> 00,02well, i am
<twilight_sprinkle> yay!
<Phase4> 00,02everyone else is waiting for stream
<twilight_sprinkle> i just got back from physics :D
<twilight_sprinkle> and goddamn i hate my recitation teacher..
<BronyInstrumental> mfw i remember i haven't done my holiday science homework
<Phase4> 00,02could you explain how a volt second works?
<BronyInstrumental> or my english homework
<Jmo> Like this Phase4
*Jmo slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02bah, screw homework
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, Briliant!
<twilight_sprinkle> Jmo: revolutionary!
<Jmo> I'm related to Einstein it seems.
<twilight_sprinkle> indeed
<Sylandest> I like science...always fun to read about or watch
<Sylandest> also, morning, everypony
<twilight_sprinkle> i forget what a volt-second is anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Sylandest
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Sylandest
<BronyInstrumental> morn', Sylandest
<twilight_sprinkle> and btw hi Phase4 :)
<Phase4> 00,02ohai twilight_sprinkle :P
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, equal to one weber of magnetic flux
<Flyboy> hi again everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Flyboy
<BronyInstrumental> i haven't learned about anything we're discussing yet! damn my school for not teaching me this stuff yet
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: whats the point of it? cuz its been 2 years since that was shortly mentioned in high-school :P
<BronyInstrumental> and hi Flyboy
<Flyboy> tommorow is my birthday. and i'm getting a new computer that actually runs my games
<MadSurge> GAH, got only the Platinum God achievement left in Binding of Isaac
<MadSurge> Ergo, FIND EVERYTHING
<twilight_sprinkle> according to random internet site, looks like volt-second is just derivation
<AdamTheDuck> Yay more nightmare fuel! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33sf4G4JLmI
<AdamTheDuck> Well more just bad memories then creepy distorted music
<AdamTheDuck> than*
<AdamTheDuck> After F.E.A.R. I find music boxes really creepy :3
<AdamTheDuck> Yay I killed chat :S
<Jmo> Good job AdamTheDuck. Gold star.
<Gold_Demona> lol
*AdamTheDuck places the gold star on his hat. Yesh I feel special :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: so i guess volt-second is just the units you get by deriving the flux, hopefully i wont forget that this time :P
<BronyInstrumental> rainbow factory........ that song is related to something i'm working on :3
<twilight_sprinkle> my recitation math/physics teachers suck this term...
<Flyboy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0o61_48-0o&feature=relmfu
<Gold_Demona> This music kinda sounds Danny Elfman-esque
<trollhunter> hey is enyone out there
<AdamTheDuck> trollghost: Ohai
<Gold_Demona> Hi trollhunter
<trollhunter> chat seems abit ded
<AdamTheDuck> We're just sharing creepy songs with each other apparently. :3
<trollghost> AdamTheDuck: hello?
<twilight_sprinkle> btw Phase4 do you have any idea why the formula for the period of simple harmonic motion of a hanging spring is the same of one thats on an angled surface? formula is T=2pi*sqrt(k/m), altho i would think that on an angled surface itd be smaller
<Gold_Demona> Sharing creepy music and talking about science while we wait for the stream to come back on. :P
<trollhunter> sweet
<twilight_sprinkle> beatles is good morning music
<trollhunter> creepy you say like what
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, was distracted, someone else trying to explain flux to me
<Jmo> A flux is like a muffin.
<trollhunter> ooh you
<JakyBoy98> hey ppl
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: oh you need to explain flux? i cant do that
<AdamTheDuck> This is my alarn in the mornin' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OLJXVGh0ss
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there JakyBoy98
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, and i dont quite get what your talking about, first is hanging like attached to the ceiling? whats the second?
<AdamTheDuck> alarm*
<trollhunter> I need something fast as an alarm
<JakyBoy98> is the stream on?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: second is like a spring on a surface which is at an angle to the ground, just a spring lying on that surface
<AdamTheDuck> JakyBoy98: Nope
<JakyBoy98> :C
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: but yeah, i can try to explain flux if you want
<Jmo> One does not simply explain flux.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: although i dont think ill explain it much differently from whoever is explaining it currently
<AdamTheDuck> trollhunter: But it's such a relaxing way to start a mornin' :)
<JakyBoy98> anyone got any sugestions as to what i should draw?
<AdamTheDuck> Slipping out of bed to make a coffee while listening to this song coming from 2 rooms away
<AdamTheDuck> so soothing
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, the person who was trying to explain it was my dad, and its been 30/40 years sense he was learning this stuff so he's trying to remember it all
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> COFFEEE
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: "was"? if youre not busy with him anymore, i can try to
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i mean if youre not busy talking to him that is :P if you are, sorry or distracting you with all the pings :$
<trollhunter> coffee and ketle next to my bed best idea I ever had
<Jmo> dat ketle
<Wrek> 05back from my absense
<Dark_Horst> yay
<trollhunter> cut me some slack its late
<Jmo> dat absense
<Jmo> o.o
<Jmo> Never trollhunter.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Wrek , shall we continue our debate on whether stealth is better than power armour? :D
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, DAMNIT
<AdamTheDuck> Dat wakeup call. o.o
<Sylandest> yay~
<Wrek> 05depends AdamTheDuck on the purpose
<JakyBoy98> XD
<Flyboy> YADADADADADAD
<Sylandest> I'm awake now
<Sylandest> awwwwwww
<Flyboy> KABOOM. KABBOM
<JakyBoy98> woah...trippy
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek: For fun Wrek, always for fun. :P
<Flyboy> MORE RABBLE LESS TROUBLE
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, check skype
<Wrek> 05a fear inducing frontline trooper with high firepower that can take as much beating as a tank without going down, and being more mobile than a tank
<Wrek> 05nice morale boost
<alexxm> is this the doom guy
<Wrek> 05aswell as being demoralizing for the enemy troops
<alexxm> we're talking about
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm: Eeyup
<alexxm> thanks AdamTheDuck
<Wrek> 05AdamTheDuck: though i do not argue that stealth ops would be an effective mean.
<AdamTheDuck> Yes, I see advanced armour being a great asset to a war-time scenario but think about stealth, one could end a fight without the other side knowing who even initiated.
<AdamTheDuck> Or even before the war starts
<AdamTheDuck> I like using fancy words, makes me feel smarter than I actually am :D
<trollhunter> indubetably
<Wrek> 05thing is
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh what's this on the stream right now?
<twilight_sprinkle> so Phase4 do you want me to try and explain flux?
<twilight_sprinkle> cant promis anythin tho
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, in pm
<Jmo> Another gold star for AdamTheDuck.
<Wrek> 05the stealth would cover an entirely other aspect than the trooper
<twilight_sprinkle> mkay
<JakyBoy98> the hell is this btw?
<Wrek> 05serving different purposes
<Wrek> 05both would be great assets no doubt
<Wrek> 05anyways gona lie down
<Wrek> 05Phase4 will ninja after the EP
<Jmo> Huzzah~
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah I can't be stuffed thinking of more arguments at this hour :D
<Phase4> 00,02i may or may not, its getting late here
<Phase4> 00,02BUFFER!
<Jmo> AdamTheDuck, it's only 11:33PM. Suck it up.
<Phase4> 00,02Y U BUFFER :<
<Gold_Demona> :<
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<BronyInstrumental> getting late where?
<Wrek> 05Phase4
<Wrek> 05atleast ninja and end the stream
<AdamTheDuck> I just came from finishing my maths homework only half an hour ago, give me a break. :P
<Wrek> 05isntead of having it loop on menu
<Jmo> Australia, BronyInstrumental.
<Jmo> Never AdamTheDuck.
<BronyInstrumental> Jmo: oh yeah :D that makes sense, i guess
<Phase4> 00,02can do
<Flyboy> guys, i'm editing a picture and need some good music to listen to. preferably pony music. any ideas? a playlist maybe?
<trollhunter> Jmo: where are you in australia
<AdamTheDuck> Flyboy: What kind of picture?
<Jmo> Western Australia trollhunter.
<Flyboy> a D&D/MLP Picture
<Gold_Demona> Rom sounds weird with the sound pitched up like that. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Flyboy: Hmm, I don't know any fantasy style songs :/
<Flyboy> i just need any songs, as long as its pony related
<Flyboy> SHO BE DO?
<Flyboy> :D
*Jmo slaps Flyboy around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> That's all I've got.
<Flyboy> ok then
<Jmo> Put on the Balloon Party mix or something like that.
<Flyboy> ima listen to my TSFH playlist then
<Flyboy> TO GLORY!
<trollhunter> hey can we puting unrelated links in the chat ok
<trollhunter> :P
<AdamTheDuck> Dat grammar. :P
<Gold_Demona> Oh Rom. Y U so adorable? XD
<trollhunter> IKR
<Rex_Mundi> Good cop bad cop
<BronyInstrumental> why does he look so happy here?
<AdamTheDuck> Why does that guy creep me out?...
<Gold_Demona> Which guy?
<AdamTheDuck> The guy with no wrinkles
<Jmo> Rofl AdamTheDuck.
<Dark_Horst> oh that guy
<AdamTheDuck> Looks so unnatural
<Dark_Horst> his name is odo and he's a changling. sort of
<Dark_Horst> shapeshifter, is the term they use
<Gold_Demona> Odo has wrinkles?
<AdamTheDuck> Well that explains that
<Gold_Demona> Oh derp. Bad reading ftw
<JakyBoy98> "there changelings remember"
<Gold_Demona> Ignore me. I phail at teh reading. :P
<Rex_Mundi> hes a changling, he lives off love?
<Dark_Horst> his bade form is a puddle of orange brown goop
<Dark_Horst> *base
<Rex_Mundi> Cardashian empire lol
<Dark_Horst> he has no wrinkles becasue that surpasses his maximum resolution^^
<Dark_Horst> he'S not hd-ready, so to speak
<JakyBoy98> gah this is confusing me you guys
<Rex_Mundi> Empress Kim Cardashian
<Gold_Demona> I imagine chemicals would reek havoc on Odo.
<Chrysalis> twilight_sprinkle why would it be smaller
<Chrysalis> if theres no contact between the surface and the spring
<Chrysalis> then its actually just a point
<Chrysalis> so the angle of the surface doesnt affect the spring
<Chrysalis> if there is contact
<Chrysalis> then its a complex system
<Chrysalis> oh wow, icechat didnt auto scroll
<trollhunter> buffering:'(
<Jmo> o.o
<Chrysalis> wonder how long ago the message about springs was
<Chrysalis> oh,
<Chrysalis> half an hour ago
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, thats what i was thinking, if its hanging from an angled wall it is a point
<twilight_sprinkle> Chrysalis: because the force of gravity is acting weaker
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, but the way he/she worded it, sounded like it was sitting on the surface
<MadSurge> Now kiss me
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: he :P
<Phase4> 00,02and now i know
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah it was sitting on a surface
<Chrysalis> yeah, that would make a difference
<Chrysalis> if the spring is suspended or resting
<Chrysalis> but either way, the formula is the same
<Chrysalis> you just need to resolve it before hand
<twilight_sprinkle> here is a picture http://panda.unm.edu/Courses/Price/Phys160/F37-1.jpeg
<Phase4> 00,02oic
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, acceleration on the spring would be lesser, otherwise identical
<Phase4> 00,02assuming a frictionless surface that is
<twilight_sprinkle> it is frictionless
<Phase4> 00,02g
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: well i would think that if the force and acceleration is smaller, that would change the period of it
<Chrysalis> and i got to go again guys, my house has decided that it no longer wants to work
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, g*sin(40) in place of g, otherwise identical
<Jmo> Several people are probably staring at this chat thinking 'wat'
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: well yeah, id think that because a weaker force is acting on it, the period for harmonic vibrations would be differnet
<trollhunter> c yaa Chrysalis
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Chrysalis
<Jmo> Toodles Chrysalis
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> toodles?
<Jmo> Problem?
<Chrysalis> wow, not heard that one in a while
<Phase4> 00,02later Chrysalis
<Jmo> :P
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, oscilation should be dependant on the mass and k, i'm not sure how much it depends on spring tension
<trollhunter> well I best be off
<AdamTheDuck> Bye trollhunter
<Phase4> 00,02later trollhunter
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: well formula wise i guess it doesnt include it, but it seems weird to me. i tired to take a portion of the mass
<twilight_sprinkle> bye trollghost
<trollhunter> ???
<twilight_sprinkle> trollhunter:
<trollhunter> ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> so many trolls
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, i'm just thinking it through, i dont think the force in the spring changes with its tension
<sub06905> dem wrinkles
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, therefor any constant acceleration cancles out
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: they pull ait it slightly and release though
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: "If the block is pulled slightly down the incline and released, what is the period of the resulting oscillations?"
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm... Watch the interesting murder mystery, or sleep?...
<AdamTheDuck> Murder mystery it is!
<Phase4> 00,02if the systems are otherwise equal, including the pull, then it should be equal
<alexxm> i missed the troll
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: he wasnt a troll, his name was just troll
<alexxm> ah ok
<Gold_Demona> dat Cardassian neck trick
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: what do you mean by systems?
<AdamTheDuck> Dat softdrink
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, spring and mass
<Gold_Demona> My neck is amused by this, Odo
<Gold_Demona> Gul "the neck" Dukat
<MASF123> I liek owning people in games. ^_^
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B
<WallDives> MASF123, so do I. ^_^
*Lil_B is a happy Lil'B
<Lil_B> hi AdamTheDuck :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: hmm well maybe, ill think about it some more
<Jmo> Y SO HAPPY Lil_B
<Lil_B> Jmo ME IS SO HAPPY!
<Jmo> MESA SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU
<MadSurge> NO FRIENDSHIP?! :[
<Lil_B> yesterday I finished my entry to Remix War V and today I got my new Headphones :3
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, try the first example, hanging from the celing, with different gravity
<MadSurge> Hey Lil_B! :)
*Lil_B hugs MadSurge :)
<WallDives> sup MadSurge.
<AdamTheDuck> Wow my stream is really far behind :/
<Lil_B> btw is something streaming? my connection is really bad atm
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you mean musicbox Luna?
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B: Yeah there's a stream on
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: thing is that to derive the formula its ma=kx, and x and a are expressed through harmonic oscillations. but i just realized that in that derivation its missing gravity force, so i need figure out where it went
<Lil_B> MadSurge did you hear the final version?
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck what is it?
<HiImSpike> hey everybrony
<Lil_B> hi there HiImSpike
<MadSurge> WallDives: hey! Gotta get everything in Binding of isaac... So tedious :|
<AdamTheDuck> Hello HiImSpike
<MadSurge> Lil_B: nope, go ahead and send it to me :D
<HiImSpike> hey Lil_B hey AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B: Star Gate I think, not sure because I missed a bit of the beginning
<HiImSpike> whos streaming???
<Lil_B> MadSurge I once had a lot of stuff in Binding of Isaac, but then I eccedently deleted the safe :/
<AdamTheDuck> HiImSpike: Wrek is
<WallDives> MadSurge, what are you on about?
<HiImSpike> thnx
<MadSurge> WallDives: Steam game, you know
<WallDives> dont play on steam, so....dont know. >.>
<Dark_Horst> nice voice
<MadSurge> EEEEEEEEEE
<Dark_Horst> rom, the bio alarm
<MadSurge> Smile :D
<Lil_B> slow internet is slow -.- can't even load my video list on YT
<MASF123> RAAM's Shadow.
<AdamTheDuck> Well time to sleep, goodnight everyone.
<AdamTheDuck> :)
<Jmo> Night AdamTheDuck
<HiImSpike> cya AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh screw it, I'll stay until episode ends
<Lil_B> is my chat dead?
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: We're enjoying the stream too much I guess. =)
<HiImSpike> is it slow or is it that me... The video to ask
<killerpony7733> Must be your connection
<killerpony7733> Streams all good on my end
<Gold_Demona> Here too
<HiImSpike> must be soz for asking
<AdamTheDuck> Cool, time to sleep
<AdamTheDuck> Night all :P
<AdamTheDuck> again
<Gold_Demona> Night AdamTheDuck
<HiImSpike> night
<Phase4> 00,02i think Wrek went to sleep
<Lil_B> MadSurge did you get the link?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: yep
<Lil_B> good XD my chat dies so I wasn't sure XD
<Lil_B> afk, getting something to eat
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Did ya hijack the stream?
<MadSurge> :O
<killerpony7733> Yep he did
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, yes but i have to sleep
<killerpony7733> Ah i see
<MadSurge> What's this?
<Phase4> 00,02i had something planed to stream tonight but star trek
<Phase4> 00,02so thats for tomorow
<Phase4> 00,02i will leave you to wonder what it is
<Jmo> I'll get a kangaroo onto you Phase4.
<Jmo> Teaser ;~;
<Vordox> Phase4: Is it PSo2? :P
<WallDives> Phantasy Star online 2?
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<WallDives> aw.
<Phase4> 00,02if any of you actually guess it i will eat my shoes live on webcam
<Jmo> Magicka
<Jmo> Smite
<WallDives> my hopes were up, too.
<Jmo> Guild Wars 2
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Gold_Demona> Oh! I know! It's QWOP
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Gold_Demona> Aw :<
<twilight_sprinkle> star wars the old republic?
<Vordox> Phase4: Dust?
<twilight_sprinkle> (random guess)
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, that'd be interesting.
<Jmo> I think we're more desperate to see you eat a shoe then the 'secret' itself.
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, i wish, damned thing crashes
<twilight_sprinkle> half life 3!
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4 is secretly Gabe Newell!
<killerpony7733> Hmm phase is known to be a indie gamer so idunno maybe something around that
<Phase4> 00,02but that is technically the closest guess so fatr
<Jmo> o.O
<Phase4> 00,02far'
<Gold_Demona> Does half life 3 even exist yet?
<Jmo> That'd be something.
<Jmo> The half-life 3 is a lie.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: hmmm
<killerpony7733> Phase4 KOTOR?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: a prtal mod?
<twilight_sprinkle> *portal
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: perhaps that one with the prequel?
<trollghost> valves last game is counterstrike:GO
<Phase4> 00,02your all horribly horribly wrong
<trollghost> are they actually kidding us
<trollghost> they didnt even have the decency to put a number in it
<Jmo> You're a monster.
<Phase4> 00,02so tempted to stay up and show it now
<Jmo> ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Is it a movie?
<twilight_sprinkle> keep guessing, we gotta make him eat his shoes xD
<Jmo> How about you give a sneak peek then run off to sleep?
<trollghost> there next game is gonna be half life 2: episode 2: part 2
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: do it!
<Dark92Enigma> Can anypony give me a link to lottery survey?
<Gold_Demona> trollghost: Yes!
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Phase4> 00,02you know what? dont need to be at school untill 2pm
<killerpony7733> Dark92Enigma There isn't any yet i think
<Gold_Demona> Cuz we all know Valve can't count to 3. XD
<trollghost> or team portal 1 and 2
<Dark92Enigma> Oh.....HOW CAN I GO TO THE LOTTERY?
<twilight_sprinkle> left 3 team portal 2.2
<twilight_sprinkle> *left 4
<trollghost> or dota fortress 1 and 2
<trollghost> actually its gonna be portal 2:episode 2
<trollghost> then team fortress 2: episode 2
<Phase4> 00,02now you guys get to see why you were horribly horribly wrong
<Jmo> Is it some old school movie?
<trollghost> team fortress doesnt even have much of a tnagent story to continue in a next episode but valve will prove us wrong
<MadSurge> :O
<killerpony7733> Oh god
<Dark_Horst> HAHA!
<twilight_sprinkle> wut is dis
<Buytoast> oh boy, chinese team fortress 2
<Jmo> wat.
<Sylandest> what is this i dont even
<Dark_Horst> i even know that shit xD
<MadSurge> CHINESE TEAM FORTRESS2!
<killerpony7733> Damn i nearly forgot about this
<twilight_sprinkle> lol never knew they had tht
<Dark_Horst> i'd like to know why the soldier is a firefighter
<WallDives> also, MadSurge, con tournement. WallDrunk. lost in grande finals in skullgirls.
<Buytoast> you better play the firebat one
<Buytoast> that one's pretty good
<Phase4> 00,02Buytoast, fine, one more
<alexxm> chinese team fortress?
<Phase4> 00,02but i'm not showing the sniper one
<MadSurge> WallDives: awww, did you get second at least?
<Phase4> 00,02thats just wierd
<Buytoast> screw the sniper one
<Dark_Horst> why yes, chinese engineer sells fish
<Dark_Horst> oh wait
<MASF123> The Chinese Team Fortess 2 omg I remember this...and the sniper's a chick lol
<Dark_Horst> that's the heavy xD
<MASF123> The Heavy is "The Fatman"
<WallDives> MadSurge, well, thats what was meant by "lost in grand finals". I got second, but played the entire tournament inebriated.
<trollghost> team jong yil
<Phase4> 00,02Buytoast, :P
<Gold_Demona> dat goosestep
<killerpony7733> I like how this game is largely 1% original made content
<Buytoast> oh boy, time for the best one
<MadSurge> WallDives: that's awesome, I'm glad you got back the passion :D
<killerpony7733> All else is just taking parts of some games mashing them together
<Phase4> 00,02from what i've seen they actually do have some original content
<Buytoast> time to rev up those feels
<Dark_Horst> conventional weapons in tf? those chinese have really no idea what the fuck they're doing
<alexxm> so pyros a clown in the chinese version
<Phase4> 00,02look what file i happen to have aquired
<Cavale> lol clown pyro
<twilight_sprinkle> daw

<Jmo> Dovah, great news about DS!
<Phase4> 00,02da crap is an id number
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Dovah
<Dovah> Jmo: its $40 and not $70?

<alexxm> how you doing Dovah
<Jmo> And it looks damn sexy.
<MadSurge> SHOW US YOU'RE A REAL CHINESE, SHOW US YOUR ID

<Phase4> 00,02i dont know what that number needs to be
<MASF123> 相4
<alexxm> what happened Dovah
<Phase4> 00,02holy crap
<Phase4> 00,02its a litteral id
<MASF123> The square means Phase
<Dovah> alexxm: not entirly sure on that either..
<MASF123> 4 means 4.
<Phase4> 00,02The input ID card is not legitimate
<Phase4> 00,02you NEED a chinese id
<Jmo> o.o
<Jmo> Talk about information leech.
<Phase4> 00,02this is disturbing
<MadSurge> NO FUN FOR CAPITALIST PIGS
<Buytoast> THE AMERICAN PIG DOGS CAN NEVER BE ALLOWED TO TAINT OR FUN ORIGINAL ENTERTAINMENT
<PillowPoni> Ok I'm awake now. What's going on?
<Vivix> Hello!
*Jmo glomps Vivix tightly
<Jmo> NOMTH.
*Vivix huggles Jmo
<Vivix> What is Phase4 doing?
<Phase4> 00,02i think that worked
<Jmo> Phase4 was trying to play a Chinese TF2 Rip-off PillowPoni, but he can't due to the fact you need a legit Chinese ID to play it.
<MASF123> 相四 Phase4
*Lil_B hugs Vivix
<Vivix> Ooh!
<Jmo> But maybe Phase4 has worked around it.
<Vivix> Hi Lil_B!
<Phase4> 00,02looks like it worked
*Vivix huggles Lil_B aswell
<Jmo> How are you doing Vivix?
<Vivix> That guy will probably get a letter now, that his time in TF2 ripoff has been used up
<Vivix> I'm good, you?
<Phase4> 00,02'axProtect initilization failed'
<Jmo> I'm grand! :3
<Lil_B> can't wactch what Phase4 is doing, Stream won't load so I'm watching to boldly flee part 2 :)
<Vivix> Aah
<Vivix> wow, those forum members use giant text
<MASF123> Hey Phase4....相四 That should mean Phase4...but it could be wrong
<Vivix> looks like Phase4 to me
<MASF123> Look up a tutorial for it.
<LunarSS> MASF123: iirc those symbols mean 'root' 'ear' and '4' but kanji are strange so it's probably right
<PillowPoni> Jmo why is Phase4 trying to play a ripoff of Chinese.....? Won't that mess with his computer somehow?
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: Phase4 is trying to make the TF2 chinese ripoff to work
<Vivix> It shouldn't affect his computer at all
<Buytoast> it's the official chinese ripoff
<Jmo> Mess with his computer? Not at all :P
<MaxTheBrony> back
<MASF123> 相四 Search up on a translato online
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: it will infect his computer with chinese propaganda :D
<Phase4> 00,02actually its probably doing all sortsa wierd shit
<Jmo> The chinese government is gonna hunt your arse down now Phase4. :>
<twilight_sprinkle> its scanning your computer to determine if you are a true communist
<Phase4> 00,02and then xchat bugged
<Phase4> 00,02also wont let you run if procmon is running
<Jmo> I love how I say that you disconnect o.o
<Vivix> I remembr trying to register on a chinese forum, and I had to put in my schoolgrades and ID
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<PillowPoni> Well if Phase needs an official ID.....*shrug*
<MaxTheBrony> D:

<LunarSS> MASF123: oh I didn't relise those first 2 were compound which also changes the meaning

<Vivix> Aww
<twilight_sprinkle> bye
<Eli> aww again
<Vivix> Bye twilight_sprinkle
<killerpony7733> valoreins Still think a girl brony should not be called a pegasister
<Eli> bye twilight_sprinkle
<Phase4> 00,02so
<MASF123> 相四 means Phase4...will you use it? :)
<killerpony7733> valoreins Whos the lucky couple though?
<Eli> i agree with killerpony7733
<MaxTheBrony> What is that game Phase4 ?
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue whats goign on in this program
<Jmo> I'm I supposed to say aww?
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, already chose something else
<Jmo> Am I*
<Phase4> 00,02MaxTheBrony, 'Final Combat'
<Phase4> 00,02Chinese tf2
<Jmo> How to do dis Vivix D:
<valoreins> just some pair in my facebok brony group
<MaxTheBrony> Ah :o
<Vivix> how do wat Jaymoo
<killerpony7733> valoreins Ah i see, that's good
<MASF123> Copy and paste it Phase4 and search it up on Google and Translate it it means Phase4 honest. :(
<Jmo> Vivix pls.
<Vivix> pls
<killerpony7733> Jmo pls
<Jmo> PLS.
<Phase4> 00,02whast this other button
<Vivix> plsss
<Jmo> kllrpwny73 plss
<Alchemist> problem is that the label brony is thrown around a lot and people mean different things by it
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know what this is
*PillowPoni hugs valoreins "don't worry, you'll find someone~"
<Phase4> 00,02looks like chinese steam
<MASF123> Um...search it up on Google how to start Final Combat setup
<Phase4> 00,02i clicked a button
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<killerpony7733> Alchemist True, But brony while it has a hint of masculininity in it's name sake it's still quite neutral
<valoreins> PillowPoni: i know, i know :(
<Jmo> valoreins, you've always got muffins in the meantime.
<MASF123> I'll look it up ok Phase4....gonna try to help you out.
<Phase4> 00,02k
<trollghost> the bro in brony is from /b/ro
<trollghost> so its not really masculinity
<Vivix> Originally, yes, but it doesn't matter where it originated when words change
<killerpony7733> valoreins You will, Trust me i found someone due to BS hehe
<trollghost> but it hasnt changed
<JRP> Phase4: buildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildin
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: i share the same view as you, but many others say that because its a mosaic from "bro"+"pony" it should be applied only to men
<Vivix> it has, many people use it as brother pony
<trollghost> people just dont know the real meaning of it
<killerpony7733> valoreins You will eventually get there.
<Vivix> Etymylogy changes really fast
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<trollghost> its internet slang.
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt actually seem to have installed any persistant services
<valoreins> killerpony7733: yea tq XD
<Vivix> Either way, it is waht you want it to be, and that's it
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: not to mention that many times have I heard that a brony is someone who watches mlp AND agrees with the term love and tolerate
<Phase4> 00,02thats nice of them
<Eli> Alchemist: well fine. but find another word than "pegasister" omfg
<trollghost> then why is it worth arguing about?
<Vivix> I'm..not arguing
<trollghost> the only thing thats changed about it is that it was originally a /co/ny
<Jmo> Vivix, quit arguing damn you.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 theyre not very persistant then
<Jmo> ;~;
<Vivix> Jmo ;_;
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<StinkomanFan> KERBAL
*Lil_B takes a glimps in the chat, "Hi Eli valoreins and killerpony7733 :)"
<killerpony7733> Alchemist love and Tolerate is a bit silly, I mean no where is it mentioned but if someone wants to live by such a view point they surely shouldn't be stopped. Though some are just idiots about it
<Eli> hi Lil_B
<valoreins> ohai Lil_B
<killerpony7733> Lil_B Oi
<Vivix> Well, brony is what you want it to be because it no longer really affiliates with 4chan. I've never been to 4chan, and I'd just say I call myself that because I'm a fan of the show, and it's easier to just say "yes" than to explain your terms
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<Jmo> Explain your terms Vivix.
<Jmo> :3
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Vivix> I like the show, and... the fandom is nice to be in
<trollghost> yea because when people sent those death threats sent to a mlp writer when they changed the derpy episode, that was a whole lot of love and tolerating going on
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue what happened there
<Pink3> GUYS GUYS MLP IS ON THE HUB RIGHT NOW
<Phase4> 00,02every time you try to monitor it, final combat just legs it
<trollghost> Pink3: its reruns/
<Phase4> 00,02reboot time again
<MASF123> sorry Phase4 no luck but I'm still looking
<Vivix> !
<Jmo> Phase4 is gone again, trash the chat.
<Pink3> trollghost, I know that i just like the show :P
<Vivix> love and tolerate is a choise you must make outside of MLP
<Eli> Pink3: taht would be awesome! if I had the hub channel
<Vivix> I chose it years before mlp
<Jmo> dat choise
<Jmo> :3
<killerpony7733> Vivix Welp i can be and most likely am just what a brony is except i don't use the name, I just say i'm part of the community and a fan of the show itself no need to give it a name for what fan i am
<Pink3> SLENDER PONYT
<trollghost> i like /co/ny more than /b/rony
<valoreins> is it safe if i ask for ponies in bronystate?
<valoreins> :3
*MASF123 kicks over a trashcan
<Lil_B> I may have to check on my WLan Stick Location, this connection is Not Accepteble D:<
<Vivix> killerpony7733: truue, but if someone asks if you are, it's easier to just say sure than to explain it?
<Jmo> Yes it is valoreins
<JRP> guys want to do somthing fun . say apple
<Jmo> Ask for it all the time.
<killerpony7733> valoreins Why yes, Yes it is >_>
<trollghost> banana
<valoreins> lol
<Eli> valoreins: nope. don't try, don't listen to killerpony7733 and Jmo
<valoreins> ah just like the usual bs chat
*Jmo flips Eli
<Jmo> SHOO BE DOO MOTHERBUCKER.
<Jmo> ;~;
<killerpony7733> Vivix Eh i don't mind explaining, But i just at it's simplest say ''i'm a fan of the show so that's about it
<Vivix> hehe
*Eli turns himself back
<valoreins> i eventually tolerates G3 because of these people
<Vivix> killerpony7733: yeah true, I mean I am a fan of the show first, and part of fandom second. If the fandom crumbled- I'd still enjoy the show
<Eli> Jmo: hey, nothing against my mom! at least not on her birthday :P
<Phase4> 00,02it may be time to give up
<JRP> bicyclerepairman: help my bike is broken and i dont know how to fic it
<Vivix> But- I can't really say "hey, you're not a brony" to anyone
<Lil_B> I normaly say "I'm a Fan of MLP" and not "I'm a Brony" but I have my own easons :)
<JRP> fix*
<Jmo> Oh I'm sorry Eli.
<MadSurge> Phase4: go to bed!
<Jmo> ^
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, NUUUUUUUUUUU
<Vivix> Yeah, I think I might do that too, I've never been asked if I'm a brony, only if I like the show
<killerpony7733> valoreins I can watch any amount of previous gens without flinching, Cause to me it has become so hilarious to watch. I can't help laughing at it
<valoreins> yup
<trollghost> Phase4: eat your pickles
<Vivix> I can't see Phase4's clock..21:10?
<Chrysalis> wow MvM has had a MASSIVE hit on server fill
<JRP> no
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, 01:10
<Vivix> Ahh, STAY UP FOR THREE MORE HOURS
<Lil_B> MadSurge you know kids, they stay up as long as they can, saying that it's not bedtime yet, and than tehy pass out at 8pm
<JRP> but to say that
<trollghost> Chrysalis: i was just playing on mvm and it only took 2 minutes, then again i was on mann up mode
<Eli> I'm also just a fan of mlp. but i call myself a brony because I'm lazy, and i don't care if someone calls me a gay homo fag pedo :)
<Vivix> hehe
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D kids these days
<trollghost> i prefer /co/ny
<JRP> its 1:11 am of the 28/8/12
<Chrysalis> trollghost im not on about the MvM servers, normal tf2 servers, most of my favourites are all empty
<Chrysalis> and they used to be always full
<MadSurge> Actually, what's Phase4's age?
<Phase4> 00,0219
<JRP> Phase4 is 21jhof
<trollghost> Phase4: eat your pickles
<valoreins> but then for all guys like us, we want to sleep early but ends up staying until 6AM

<Jmo> Dat box.
<Lil_B> Chrysalis which mouse?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, D:
<trollghost> JRP: Phase4 is a superhero and doing that would comprimise his aninomity
<MASF123> Phase4, afaik?
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, as far as i know
<Chrysalis> this is going striaght back

<Eli> i've seen it on display in a shop... it's like operating a macbook. it works, but it takes a lot to get into it
*trollghost furiously and wetly hugs Phase4
<MASF123> yeah...but translations or...?

<Barbetos|AtWork> The Elder Scrolls
<Dovah> And I am and agent of all of them 7 times each at least
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: I played Fallout 3, that was enough :D great game
<Barbetos|AtWork> But Obsidian did that
<BaconMane> 0,5I do NOT reccomend Morrowind or Oblivion
<Barbetos|AtWork> They only used the oblivion engine
<NocturnalBlade> MadSurge: i love Fallout 3 lol

<BaconMane> 0,5It's one thing to be a fan of skyrim
<BaconMane> 0,5Because lots of people like skyrim
<Panda> BaconMane Krosis....
<Bronysith> Fallout is much better series than The elder scrolls
<BaconMane> 0,5It's ANOTHER to be a fan of the entire Elder Scrolls Series
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: oh i have that mask!

<abrony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/220/
<GilDash> Panda: You act like it's a bad thing. ;)
<Barbetos|AtWork> And then there was Dark Fall.

<trollghost> they spend 100,00s of dollars every episode on guns and other stupid things, yet they wont take the picture to forensic specialists, who would do it free for the publicity, to ACTUALLY disprove the myth

<Chrysalis> break all the things
<alexxm> 24 inch pythons
<trollghost> BaconMane: but they spend 3/4 of the show just talking and not doing anything
<Dark_Horst> trollghost: they dont get it to orensics, becasue that would go against everything the show is designed for
<MadSurge> Also it makes for better television
<Dark_Horst> trollghost: it would also be boring
<BaconMane> 0,5Thats too bad now ain't it :P
<Obsidian> Need to get some work done. Bye everypony!
<GilDash> Perhaps they need to use some lasers?
<trollghost> but they could at least do it as a bonus because you can tell they know whether a myth is true or not when the show starts
<trollghost> just a little clip at the end saying wether they were actually right or not
<XylemTube> It's things like this that make me love this stream :)

<Sumica> 00,10they still have the ingnition cap at the end of the bullet.
<Shizuka> 13yeah cars can kill people too but you can buy those
<trollghost> but guns are made to kill and harm
<trollghost> cars are made for transport
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Invi> but you have to have an license to drive a car :D
*Pearly hugs Jmo "hi there"
<trollghost> you have to have a license to buy a gun
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: and to own a gun
<trollghost> difference is gun licenses are free
<Sumica> 00,10permit is not a license
<trollghost> and that]
<Invi> Spectrum_Rush, in the US too?
<trollghost> cars are being made to less harm the enviroment and to cause less damage to things, guns are being made to do more damage
<BaconMane> 0,5*gremlin panic*
<trollghost> so yea
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: well as Sumica said permit so it abit different
<trollghost> i think i just destroyed half the chat
<Invi> well with security as an excuse you can have weapons
<Shizuka> 13i think you just proved you're ignorant of reality
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<trollghost> and that worked out great with andeers brievick
<Shizuka> 13yep we just have to ban all guns, that way only bad guys have.... guns...
<Shizuka> 13see the problem?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yeah and what about drunk idiots with guns
<Jmo> How you doing Pearly :O
<trollghost> but if you had gun laws then there wouldnt BE any bad guys with guns
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: what about kids who bring guns to school and shoto teachers
<trollghost> see the problem?
<Shizuka> 13bullshit
<Sumica> 00,10what did that titus guy say.
<Spectrum_Rush> there are gun laws
<Invi> ^
<Dovah> trollghost: bad guys BREAK the law..
<Buytoast> AMERICA
<Shizuka> 13why would a guy who wants to commit a crime with a gun not want to break a gun law to do it?
<twilight_sprinkle> cops will be the protectors with guns
<Buytoast> AMERICA
<Sumica> 00,10every one should be required to carry a gun by law
<BaconMane> 0,5HAHA
<BaconMane> 0,5Im laughing
<Buytoast> NO GUN CONTROL FOR THEEE
<Shizuka> 13what possible logic is there behind that
<Dovah> they don't give a shit if there i a law or not
<Tovler> School Shooting is a pretty good band though.
<trollghost> ok look, lemme explain in the long run

<Shizuka> 13that is the single most ignorant thing i've heard todya
<twilight_sprinkle> while im against the america hate, the gun freedom si one of th dumbest laws ever...
<Eulshy> If i wanted to shoot someone, and guns were illegal, i would still shoot someone
*Pearly gives Jmo some tea and cookies
<trollghost> if you, america, who has the largest public gun companys, would go out of buisness, then there are less guns
<Shizuka> 13uh
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Sumica> 00,10grant logic
<trollghost> that solves part of the problem
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, eeyup I agree
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: you wouldnt Have a gun if they were illegal for civillians
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah... no
<Shizuka> 13you're assuming it's possible to remove guns from the world
<Shizuka> 13the tech and knowledge is out there
<Dovah> twilight_sprinkle: no a dumb law is that in penn. it is illegal to shoot a whale from a moving vehical
*Jmo noms tea and cookies gracefully
<Shizuka> 13you don't get to take it back
<trollghost> the next part of the solution is giving your cops, and people, NON LETHAL WEAPONS
<Jmo> Thank you Pearly :3
<Shizuka> 13to try to do so is immensely stupid
<Sumica> 00,10give me a pony, you can have my gun
<BaconMane> 0,5trollghost people can make their own guns and then that will be GOOD for weapon dealers
<Buytoast> anything is lethal
<trollghost> pepperspray, batons, tasers, firesim guns
<Buytoast> i can beat you to deatn with a stick
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, If guns become illegal people will just use bows and cross bows
<Shizuka> 13you know we better ban pencils
<BaconMane> 0,5Especially from foreign countries
<Buytoast> i can chock you with feathers
<Shizuka> 13you could hurt someone with those
<abrony> ima go guys buh bye
<trollghost> so instead of KILLING them, they would be more scared of the pain those things would induce
<Pearly> welcome Jmo :D
<Invi> Sumica, here, have Twilight. you can use her as a gatling :D
<BaconMane> 0,5PNCLS R DNGERUSS
<Buytoast> fuck, i can shove your face in my ass and suffocate you
<Buytoast> so many ways to kill
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: bows and crossbows are hard to make, and they dont do as muc hdamage
<Tovler> I remember when that one random guy pointed a gun at me then changed his mind or something.
<Spectrum_Rush> I can slit your throat with a piece of cardboard
*Dovah knows how to make a railgun
<trollghost> justice requires punishment like hurting for insentive of people not doing it
<Shizuka> 13you know we better ban all knives too
<Spectrum_Rush> anything is a weapon
<Shizuka> 13someone could get hurt
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, not as hard as you fink
<Shizuka> 13for that matter
<Shizuka> 13let's just have everyone live in a padded cell alone
<Sumica> 00,10wrap the world in bubble wrap
<Shizuka> 13that way no one ever gets hurt
<RoboGerbil> anypony interested in roleplaying is magic?
<Sumica> 00,10cause sharp edges
<Dovah> Shizuka: my cousin cut himself with a spoon, do whe have to ban those too?
<trollghost> no no no, KNIFES are not made to kill people, unless they were
<Invi> trollghost, people always find a way to murder each other so it would be senseless to ban everything that could kill
<twilight_sprinkle> thats all very funny Shizuka, but from personal experience i know of people whos friends have Died from moronic civillians with guns
<trollghost> xD
<StinkomanFan> SCIENCE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We should ban books too. Once a child learns the power of reading, the terrorists win.
<Invi> what about knife guns?
<Buytoast> reading is a dangerous thing
<Buytoast> you know whom read things?
<Shizuka> 13sb is right
<Tovler> its a lot more inconvenient to kill someone without a gun.
<Buytoast> hitler

<BaconMane> 0,5NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LIVE
<twilight_sprinkle> its a lot harder to kill with a knife

<Sumica> 00,10oh hey Shizuka
<Jmo> is going on.
<Jmo> ;~;
<trollghost> ok lets see how many mass murders were caused by guns
<Dovah> I could Kill you with my hands, are those banned too?
<Sumica> 00,10we need to ban gravity
<Sumica> 00,10cause gravity kills
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'M FROM THE FUTURE WHERE EVERYPONY TALKS IN CAPS NORMALLY.
<trollghost> all of them

<Eulshy> We are having to much fun finking of what to ban
<Invi> trollghost, and how many by swords...
<Jmo> I don't like this SuperBrony64
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: dont forget witj=h rope we can strangle people, better ban that to
<Dovah> trollghost: Bombings
<Shizuka> 13trollghost: uh most of them were caused by bacteria
<Buytoast> the crusades didn't have guns
<Buytoast> they had god
<Tovler> I can wound a whole classroom in seconds with my bare hands.
<Buytoast> and swords
<Shizuka> 13oh you mean exclusively human on human
<Buytoast> lots of swords
<Spectrum_Rush> you can be killed by a pillow
<BaconMane> 0,5trollghost you seem to forget airplanes flying into buildings and the holocaust poison gas things
<trollghost> lets see how many were killed by other modern day implements (excluding bombs, which are already illegal) minimal
<Shizuka> 13in that case most of them were caused by bacteria
<Spectrum_Rush> better ban bacteria
<RoboGerbil> Spectrum_Rush: by your logic we should ban pianos too
<BaconMane> 0,5^^^
<BaconMane> 0,5No bacteria
<Tovler> e. coli is banned
<BaconMane> 0,5If you are caught with bacteria you die
<Shizuka> 13but if we ban bacteria
<AJIsAwesome> We'd better ban water, too. Water can kill.
<Shizuka> 13then we cease to exist
<Invi> ban all the things!!
<Spectrum_Rush> RoboGerbil: that can kill ya too
<trollghost> OK, well lets see. bombs, illegal, bioterrorism, all AGAINST THE LAW
<Dark_Horst> human nature. invent something and someone else will find some way to kill someone with it
<Shizuka> 13because you have about a hundred times more bacterial cells on you than you do your own actual cells
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think if we brought maps to all the South Africans, it would help be able to affirm our alegiance to KFC and bring peace to those in Iraq by helping to identify the US on the maps.
<Dovah> we must Ban the Ban hammer becaus hammers can kill
<Eulshy> Does it really matter? You can ban as many weapons and fings as you want, as long as there are two people on the planet, someone will want someone dead, and they will find a way to make it happen
<Dovah> trollghost: that doesnt stop them now does it?
<Buytoast> what else can we ban because it causes death
<Buytoast> masturbation
<trollghost> no, we are talking about man made localalised murders
<Buytoast> that killed a guy
*Tovler questions the age of people here.
<Spectrum_Rush> Buytoast: food

<AJIsAwesome> Eulshy: Are you quoting the sniper?
<Shizuka> 13see trollghost shows everything that's wrong with society today, if we just say THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW the problem will immediately go away and never return

<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, Thats not a valid point, people used to kill people with rocks, anyone can kill someone with a rock, rocks are free and everywhere i could pick up a rock and kill any unsuspecting person
<Shizuka> 13right to everything, suspended
<AJIsAwesome> We should ban the sun, too. Heat can kill.:P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ban Antarctica, there's a plan we can all agree with.
<Dovah> pull a star trek NG "you stepped on the grass when the sign said not to, you must die now"
<Buytoast> It's a dangerous place
<Spectrum_Rush> yay the suspended is back
<Buytoast> they got polar bears
<Shizuka> 13to expand on Eulshy's analogy in an actual logical manner, the point is that anyone can kill someone with a rock
<Buytoast> penguins
<Buytoast> fucking moving iceburgs
<Shizuka> 13so if you want to kill someone with a rock, you do so knowing they could do the same to you
<Shizuka> 13as the level of force you're going to inflict rises, it deters conflict if the other side could do the same
<Shizuka> 13thus, gun freedom
<Buytoast> hell they even got some killer whales and those assholes don't give a shit who you are if you look tasty
<trollghost> http://listverse.com/2011/10/22/top-10-deadliest-rampage-killers/ lets see how many were caused by guns
<trollghost> oh, look, all of them
<Shizuka> 13who would you rather attack with a gun, someone who thinks guns should be banned, or someone who is actually armed
<Syn_Virtu> water can drown ban it
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: with guns its a lot more accessible and easier to kill with. how many students do you know that stabbed their teacher? i dont know any, whereas ive heard tons of stories where a kid shot a teacher. also if you get drunk, you can kill a lot easier with a gun
<Shizuka> 13guess what trollghost every single one of those cases were against people who were not armed
<trollghost> sure, there were some other implements, but all in all, GUNS
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, so?
<Shizuka> 13ah cherry picking
<Dovah> trollghost: stop being so, so very retarted, please? do i t for fluttershy. :(
<Shizuka> 13i think we've demonstrated you're a moron, go back to the ivory tower please
<trollghost> ok, if guns were never invented
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: that 1. the opportunity to kill is a lot closer and 2. if you get drunk, yo ucan go on a shooting spree
<Invi> trollghost, then they would be invented soon ^^
<trollghost> a large amount, maybe a majority of deaths would not have happened
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i disagree with you too, i gues s that makes me moron too?
<Invi> and we wouldn't be that developped
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, the only reason they use guns is because their easy to use, with no guns those same people would still do it with something else
<Buytoast> if guns were never invented people would just bash others to death with rocks
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<BaconMane> 0,5lol u arent even making sense anymore
<Invi> trollghost, we would have killed ourselves with swords and stuff like that
<Shizuka> 13if you believe banning guns will make all guns go away, i have no words for you
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: thats not the point of banning them, the point is to not allow such easy ways of murder too weak-minded average civillains
<BaconMane> 0,5oh god
<Shizuka> 13then make the civilians not so weak
<BaconMane> 0,5i listened to this while not looking
<BaconMane> 0,5><
<trollghost> say, you ban guns for every country in the world, just lets say that, all gun companies will be gone and outlawwed
<Buytoast> oh fuck yeah rub that ice yellow fury
<Tovler> unless all countries in the world come together… yep it's impossible.
<Dovah> trollghost: so far this year 365,000 people have died from violence presuably involving guns, out of the the 37 million htat have died...
<Anotherguy> Hi guys
<AJIsAwesome> Anotherguy: Hello!
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yeah good luck with that, its been 2000 years of just this century, people are still stupid
<trollghost> then people may have guns, but they would be pretty crappy guns, not even worht maniacs buying
<Shizuka> 13yeah that's even remotely close to being realistic
<Shizuka> 13except they would still work
<trollghost> oh im sorry Shizuka i thought i was being hypothetical!
<Dovah> trollghost: people die.. deal with it.
<Shizuka> 13and now you have an entire planet that can't defend itself
<Shizuka> 13well done
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: guns also allow a lot stealthier murder
<Chrysalis> also, nothing is stopping someone from making a gun themselves
<Anotherguy> What are you guys talking about?
<Chrysalis> its not that hard
<Invi> Shizuka, the citizens can still throw rocks ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: against who, aliens? oh noez
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, so do knives!
<trollghost> the pont is, there will always be weapons
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: against the people that make their own guns
<Chrysalis> and if you outlaw all guns, how do you defend against them
<Dark_Horst> i heard of a russian who built his own mac 10 on a workbench. it was working just fine
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: not really, as murder with a gun can be from a distance
<Shizuka> 13again, if you believe banning guns will make guns go away, you're deluded
<Dark_Horst> if you ban guns, people will just build their own
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: thats what the army is for
<Dovah> Chrysalis: exactly i can make a railgun pretty easily and they are much stronger then your conventional gun
<Shizuka> 13and completely ignoring reality
<trollghost> but if we ban the worse weapon, crime would reduce exponentially
<Tovler> Tribalism is still too rampant for mankind to give up guns.
<Anotherguy> Ban cars, too
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle your point was stealth not range
<Chrysalis> railguns are awesome
<Shizuka> 13but you banned guns, what will the army fight with?
<Kandarihu> To the London Rioters, baseball bats were the weapons of choice.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the army should keep the guns
<trollghost> im not saying to everyone, sure give your god damn police and military guns
<Anotherguy> Ban my fists
<Shizuka> 13then someone has to make guns
<Chrysalis> seen that navy railgun?
<Spectrum_Rush> trollghost: this is what i want you to do, go to a war torn country, find a group of hostiles with guns, walk up to them and say guns kill they're are banned you cant have them, dont worry you'll be fine
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: or give them a bunch of taser things
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, and there are people who know how to throw knives!
<trollghost> but to the general public? doesnt cut with me
<Chrysalis> that thing sets fire to the god damn AIR
<Buytoast> wait, now he's going back on his arguments from before
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: or those bullet pellets that dont kill
<Buytoast> this is fun
<Shizuka> 13but you banned the manufacture of guns
<Chrysalis> simply through friction of the round
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: or stun gas
<Shizuka> 13you're contradicting yourself
<Dovah> Humans evolved to kill each other that is what we are best at
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: a billion solutions that dont kill
<Shizuka> 13Dovah: not quite, LIFE did
<trollghost> Spectrum_Rush: or get the military to walk up to them and take their guns off them
<BaconMane> 0,5Think of it this way
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: reaaally? what distance is that..
<Shizuka> 13that which survives longest gets to pass its genetic material on
<BaconMane> 0,5Someone wants to commit murder with a gun
<Dovah> Shizuka: eh you mean what I know
<Spectrum_Rush> trollghost: but you banned the production of guns your military has none
<BaconMane> 0,5Illegal gun or not, they're going to commit murder
<Chrysalis> BaconMane without access to a gun, theyre just gunna find another weapon
<BaconMane> 0,5Chrysalis: criminals will get guns
<BaconMane> 0,5There will be gun dealers
<trollghost> ok, well, i see i cant convince anyone who hasnt had experience with shitheads with guns, so ill comprimise
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: there will be, but there wont be much
<Shizuka> 13when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns
<BaconMane> 0,5Just like there are drug dealers
<trollghost> dont give fucking maniacs guns
<Chrysalis> also, who needs a gun
<alfopony> hi everypony
<Shizuka> 13it's common sense
<Chrysalis> there are SO many ways to kill a person
<Anotherguy> Hi alfopony
<Spectrum_Rush> maniacs will still get guns
<Tovler> maybe after 100 years of social media, others won't seem so "other" and maybe we can come to the table and hash out our differences. Until the, Gun.
<BaconMane> 0,5And you know how Alchohol used to be illegal in the US?
<twilight_sprinkle> trollghost: i know right
<Dovah> trollghost: shit head with gun? solution: a bigger gun
<Anotherguy> People shouldn't die so easily
<BaconMane> 0,5People illegally sold alchohol. Called bootlegging
<trollghost> yes yes illegal production of beer
<Buytoast> c'mon man. i'm all for starting shit and getting people riled up, but at least have good points to back yourself adn don't contradict yourself when someone proves you wrong
<Spectrum_Rush> age of prohibition
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, skilled people can throw a knife succesfully as far as they could throw anything else
<trollghost> but come on, it would have been pretty shitty beer
<Buytoast> have some tact
<Shizuka> 13prohibition failed with alcohol, prohibition failed with tobacco, prohibition will eventually fail with drugs
<twilight_sprinkle> The army should get stun devices, and criminals wont have enough resources to do anything big other that nindividual murders with their guns
<Shizuka> 13and prohibition fails and fails and fails and fails with guns
<Dark_Horst> fun fact: during the prohibition of alcohol in chicago, the amount of sold alcohol in the town multiplied
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sweet, I came in on something good!
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: youre actually comparing a gun with throwing a knife?...
<Chrysalis> even if you were to ban the production of guns
<Spectrum_Rush> this aint cod
<Chrysalis> there are ALOT of themn
<trollghost> guns are not something you cfan easily hide if you are going to use said gun
<Buytoast> oh man
<Buytoast> i have a gif
<trollghost> you know? from the gunshot?
<Buytoast> that i had saved
<Dovah> trollghost: pistols..
<trollghost> and the shape of large guns
<Anotherguy> Just count the weapons you can find in the room you are currently in
<Spectrum_Rush> Buytoast: by all means show
<Buytoast> if only i could find it
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle Why not, if people can kill with them at a range, it's the exact same principle
<Chrysalis> with so many guns in circulation
<Buytoast> some guy hiding like 15 guns in his pants
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: :|
<Chrysalis> the only thing you could do is stop selling ammo
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I remember when the guy landed the plane on the hudson river. Now that was skill, and some luck of course.
<BaconMane> 0,5trollghost: trunk of a car, bed of a truck, inside of a vehicle, a suitcase, backpack
<BaconMane> 0,5i can go on and on
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: thats like saying me throwing a pencil is the same as a sniper rifle :\
<Tovler> The cigarette culture died in America. I hope that the gun culture is at least lessoned.
<Shizuka> 13Buytoast: was a anti-gun thing for schools iirc, a teenager pulls like fifteen guns out including a long rifle... and you know he couldn't walk at all with all that hidden on him
<trollghost> THE FIRING OF A GUN I MEAN
<Dark_Horst> guns can always be concealed. during a test someone snuck a grenade, a handgund and a shotgun into a building. under his clothes
<trollghost> the gunshot is a giveaway
<Buytoast> but stil, they were hidden
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Tovler: After the aurora thing and the temple thing, I don't think so.
<Anotherguy> Chrysalis People will beat eachother up with unloaded gun
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, Your not wrong, if you sharpened a pencil and threw it right you could stab some one
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: its a fucking sniper rifles, you can kill people from hundreds of miles away, not a fucking pencil!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> There was a group of kindergarteners playing cops and robbers, and they were doing gun signs with their fingers. They got expelles.
<Dovah> trollghost: silancer.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> expelled*
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: and think about the speed
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: and force
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, yipdee freaken do, people will kill people weather they have guns or not
<trollghost> silencers wont do that much use on a KILLING SPREE that will let a lot more people be able to hear it
<Anotherguy> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: what does that even mean?...
<trollghost> Ive already said, ill compise
<Tovler> Sadly it was government that killed the cigarette culture. The NRA will never let the gun culture weaken ever ever.
<BaconMane> 0,5Im curious how old trollghost is
<trollghost> Dont. Give. Maniacs. And. Idiots. Guns.
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, it means that the factor of a guns range isn't usually the deciding factor when someone decides to kill someone
<Dovah> trollghost: black market
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Tovler: It's not a goverment, it
<Spectrum_Rush> there is no compromise, there's only winning or failure
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: nvm, the weather confused me...pot the pointi s that it wont be as ACCESIBLE AND COMON
<twilight_sprinkle> *common
<Dovah> they can get the guns themselvs
<trollghost> Dovah: im sorry did you read what i just said?
<Invi> Dovah, if they are idiots, they are probably too stupid to get them there ^^
<Shizuka> 13yeah you have no idea...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Tovler: *pressed enter at the wrong time* It's a bunch of fat cats running the coutnry.
<Shizuka> 13you are assuming all humans are rational
<Shizuka> 13they aren't
<Spectrum_Rush> Humans are a most illogical species
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We're the only species to cook our food.
<twilight_sprinkle> The army should have stun devices, and guns should be banned. Criminals wont have enough guns to do anthing big. Whats wrong with that solution
<Dovah> Shizuka: why are people so very ignorant to the world? it makes me sad :(
<Buytoast> why, i could probably go out, purchase a gun and slaughter my neighborhood right now
<Buytoast> and i'm not a maniac
<Shizuka> 13Dovah: eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> pfff
<twilight_sprinkle> arrogance
<tigher1001> hi
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I hate arrogance a shitload.
<Invi> hay tigher1001
<Shizuka> 13given a choice between arrogance and ignorance, i'll take arrogance
<twilight_sprinkle> you say that because someone disagrees with you theyre ignorant of life?
<Tovler> Kawaii_icybeauti: so Big Tobacco decided they wanted less money? Maybe it was because they're still making a fortune in Asian, but still.
<trollghost> Shizuka: whats the real difference when your wrong.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yeah well from down here it takes away credibility.
<Buytoast> so wait, was that trollghost guy actually serious or just trying to start shit?
<Dovah> ignorance is bliss... sure that is TOTALLY true
<trollghost> oh im serious
<Buytoast> oh wow
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Tovler: If it wasn't for tabacco, this coutnry wouldn't be here. I don't get why the goverment had to take that away.
<Buytoast> you're even stupider than i had thought
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ugh my spelling....:P
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: and also, arrogance is very close to ignorance
<Buytoast> and that's beautiful
<tigher1001> I saw pop rocks!!!!
<trollghost> of course ignorance is bliss Dovah, you dont seem that unhappy being as ignorant as you are
<Invi> yay seaponies
<Maid_RainBow> sea ponies
<Shizuka> 13you're assuming you're right and ignoring the mountain of evidence contradicting you, and trying to throw out little cherry picked tidbits that can be demonstrated to not actually support your position
<RoboGerbil> shoo be doo
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Thankies for the stream summi!
*Invi huggles Sumica :3
<trollghost> GUYS SHUTUP ITS SEAPONIES!
<tigher1001> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<trollghost> *hums*
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Thanks, Sumica.
<Kandarihu> Sumica, thanks for streaming
<BaconMane> 0,5lol now im convinced trollghost is an idiot
<BaconMane> 0,5well
<BaconMane> 0,5ive been convinced
<NocturnalBlade> thanks Sumica
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: hardly, i provided a solution for banning guns and nobody came up with counterpoints
<Eulshy> Shizuka, we don't need to prove this to anyone
<Dovah> trollghost: me? ignorant? :D that is the funniest thing I have heard all year!
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: You'll get used ti ut.
<AJIsAwesome> *to it*
<tigher1001> SHOOPEDO SHOOP
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We couldn't ban guns in this country. They tried alcohol, and look how that turned out.
<RoboGerbil> should find the entire episode of this
<trollghost> BaconMane: is sarcasm not in the revised american dictionary
<Kandarihu> I'm pretty much convinced that trollghost is a troll. Trying to get our goat.
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: saying something is illegal does not remove the problem, it just makes innocent people unable to legally defend themselves
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle the counter argument for banning guns is that there isn't a point
<Maid_RainBow> its Bacon and applejack
<tigher1001> AJIsAwesome: i was saying yeah
<Sumica> 00,10I have the whole ep RoboGerbil
<Kawaii_icybeauti> it's faggot and applejack
*Kandarihu slaps Maid_RainBow with a Seafilly
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: Oh. Okay.
<RoboGerbil> think its megan and applejack
<Tovler> Kawaii_icybeauti: Tobacco, wut? If it wasn't for guns, this country wouldn't be here.
<Ponies47> Hey everypony! :)
<trollghost> Shizuka: pepperspray, tasers, firesims, te police, have you never heard of these?
<Kandarihu> RoboGerbil, yes
<Dovah> Shizuka: wouldnt a solution to the argument be jsut to ban TROLLghost?
<Spectrum_Rush> ermahgerd sae pirnies, guess we should ignore whatwe've been talking about fothe past 30 mins, sorry it dont work that way
*Maid_RainBow mons on it "thankyou
<Shizuka> 13that's the easy way
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: did you read what i said? "The army should have stun devices, and guns should be banned. Criminals wont have enough guns to do anthing big."
<Invi> Shizuka, but you know, stricter weapon laws are needed. no prohibition, but stricter laws
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Tovler: That was one of the main exports when we were still a colony.
<AJIsAwesome> It'll be hilarious if Megan was a villain in MLP:FIM.:D
<Maid_RainBow> SUMICA : can you sent me that pic?
<Shizuka> 13yes stun devices will stop someone armed with lethal force
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: they will.
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> twilight_sprinkle: WROOOOOONG
<Sumica> 00,10yeah if I knew where to send it.
<Shizuka> 13they won't
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: good offense doesnt mean youre protected well
<Sumica> 00,10oh wait, i know
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, as long as people can make guns your point is invalid
<Ponies47> Fine don't say hi :(
<trollghost> Shizuka: yes because you can shoot perfectly with pepperspray in your eye and being held down
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Can you post that picutre link in the chat, please?
<RoboGerbil> lol that box says towels?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Hello!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Gawd, how the hell did we get into a gun control debate?
*Jmo glomps Ponies47 tightly "HAI"
<Spectrum_Rush> you'd be dead before ya got close enough to use a stun weapon
<RaveBrony> Maid_RainBow: Its on John Joseco's DA page
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: youre not saying anything on subject, youre just repeating yourself over and over and over
<Kandarihu> I see Peewee
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: I don't know.
<NocturnalBlade> hi Ponies47 *hug* sorry just to distracted by the chat
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, so are you

<Shizuka> 13you're more dangerous if you can't aim properly, and i severly doubt a criminal gives two damns about fire control
<Sumica> 00,10it's a JJ picture btw
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: hardly..
<StinkomanFan> I love the idea of Spike joining the CMC on there neverending quest for cutie marks
<Dovah> someone has a gun? use that..
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But we have the right to bare arms in the constitution
<Invi> who is JJ?
<Sumica> 00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/IhfonX.jpg
<tigher1001> RoboGerbil: ovously towels are very important in space
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: not surprising he's good at cute
<RaveBrony> John Joseco! <3
<Kandarihu> Kawaii_icybeauti, we absolutely do
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: what about gas grenades
<Shizuka> 13and the right to bear arms in the constitution is a check against government power
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, YOU keep repeating the same nonesense of why guns should be banned
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: gas masks
<BaconMane> 0,5Screensnapr is actually working again?
*Ponies47 Hugs Jmo and NocturnalBlade back "And hello AJIsAwesome" :3
<Tovler> Kawaii_icybeauti: My wut still stand.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah BaconMane, they wiped the system and started over
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, and you keep repeating it
<Shizuka> 13suddenly gas grenades don't work so well
<BaconMane> 0,5Ah
<Shizuka> 13tasers? armor that diffuses the taze
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But nowadays, the constitution seems meaningless. I never actually noticed this, but when you get in trouble in school, you don't have Miranada rights.
<RoboGerbil> tigher1001: dont yforget your towel
<Shizuka> 13pepper spray? eye protection
<Dovah> Shizuka: headshot?
<Spectrum_Rush> headgear
<trollghost> Shizuka: ok lets imagine this situation, you have just managed to pepperspray someone by whatever means, imagine how easy it is in his painful disoriented state to disarm him and put his chin to the ground
<Tovler> Seriously, hundreds of thousands of people went thousands of miles to california to look for a shiny metal? lol, humans
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> twilight_sprinkle: how would banning guns solve the problem?
<trollghost> im not saying how they peppersprayed them, but if they did
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> RoboGerbil: a towel is the most important thing to a hitchiker
<trollghost> how the hell is that not a solution?
<Shizuka> 13trollghost: you seriously think the guy won't start blasting his gun as fast as he can?
<Buytoast> pepper spray doesn't always stop em
<Buytoast> sometimes it just pisses them off more
<Shizuka> 13someone who needs to be pepper sprayed doesn't care who he hits
<Spectrum_Rush> or in his disoriented stae he starts fireing wildly
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: bullet power can be modified to harm but not kill
<Buytoast> and now you have to fight off an enraged fucker who wants to tear you asunder
<Eulshy> and pepper spray doesn't alays work
<Shizuka> 13and you think criminals would willingly do so?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: not the criminals..
<Shizuka> 13then what are you supposed to do against them?
<StinkomanFan> ...the hell is Spike holding?
<trollghost> Shizuka: HELL BE FALLING TO THE GROUND how would he hit anywhere near a person?!?!?
<Shizuka> 13you aren't allowed to use equal force
<StinkomanFan> Coffee?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> pepper spray fades after a little. The guy would just chase you, even if you get a 5 second head start
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: like i said, modify so it doesnt kill but stuns instead
<Shizuka> 13you are at a self-imposed disadvantage
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: A drink?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: stuns, harms
<Shizuka> 13in the words of sun tzu
<tigher1001> i want someone to steam dr.who season 2 (with the 10nth doctor)
<Shizuka> 13that's retarded strategy
<TheMaster> theres no such thing as a totally non-lethal weapon
<Dovah> trollghost: why would pepperspray couse him to fall?
<Spectrum_Rush> ever heard of bullet ricochet
<Kawaii_icybeauti> tigher1001: I'm still on the 9th.
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, tasers are non-lethal.
<TheMaster> no, they're less then lethal
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: why would be a disatvantage if its enough to take the enemoy out
<trollghost> oh ok Shizuka when a country nukes the US why dont you just nuke them back because that will solvee everything
<TheMaster> tasers kill people all the time
<Buytoast> oh man
<Shizuka> 13pepper spray makes you close your eyes and try to flush with tears, in the meantime you squeeze that trigger as many times as you can before you're taken down
<Buytoast> this kid
<Buytoast> is getting so angry
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, you can sya whatever you ant about banning guns, ban them, either people will still get ahold of them, or they will use a new means to kill, it's that simple
<Tovler> tasers are overused
<Buytoast> it's like mc donalds
<TheMaster> http://electronicvillage.blogspot.com/2009/05/taser-related-deaths-in-united-states.html
<Buytoast> i'm lovin it
<tigher1001> Kawaii_icybeauti: Than we shall watch the 9nth
<Shizuka> 13now instead of a standoff resulting in one dead criminal, you have a detained criminal and many friendly gunshot wounds
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: im not answering you until you say something new.
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: Not to sound like a jerk, but they'll request when they want to.
<Shizuka> 13well done
<Spectrum_Rush> on guns... then somehow nukes
<Dovah> trollghost: that is exactly what will happen
<Syn_Virtu> are we still talking about weapons?
<Buytoast> yeah
*Jmo pokes Vivix
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, then you say something new and i can
<NocturnalBlade> Syn_Virtu: yes
<AJIsAwesome> Syn_Virtu: Yep.
<trollghost> because the US goverment is a body of assholes i know
<Buytoast> Cockhead Mc Dumbass is still assessing everything to what he wants it to result in
<trollghost> but it wont stop the nuke hurtling towards you
<tigher1001> AJIsAwesome: i know i was joking around
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, your spouting the smae repetitive things over and over
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: again, what difference does it make if the bullets are strong enough to wound the enemy but not kill
<Dovah> trollghost: at least they are doing a better job then you could ever do.
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: Ok.
<Buytoast> instead of facing the endless possibilities of reality
<Shizuka> 13because the enemy is not showing the same restraint
<Sumica> 00,10yeah guess what baning guns still requires an honer system to bring them in.
<Bronysith> Eulshy: *you're
<Dovah> yeah I went there
<Spectrum_Rush> the human races is a body of assholes
<Shizuka> 13YOUR people can still be killed quite effectively
<Shizuka> 13you are wasting friendly lives
<TheMaster> how would you modify a bullet so that it doesn't kill someone if it hits them?
<Sumica> 00,10guess what, i would not bring mine in.
<Buytoast> rubber
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We'll get our guns from mexico. Simple/
<Shizuka> 13just because you don't want to actually kill someone who intends to kill you
<TheMaster> rubber can still kill people.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: read your last comments and notice how theyre all identical and just say "yorue wrong"
<trollghost> Shizuka: then wage war on the UK, do it, i dare you
<Kandarihu> trollghost, any country that WANTS to nuke us nowadays would do a midair detonation. It would destroy our power grid and all of our electronics, preventing us from retaliating.
<TheMaster> again, its not a 'non-lethal' weapon. its less-then lethal.
<Kandarihu> Besides. Guns =/= nukes.
*Tovler thinks of the gun rebates that black churches do to take guns off the streets.
<Shizuka> 13why would this country do that, there's no benefit to it
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, read all your comments and notice how they keep implying your right
<Bronysith> when you shoot, you shoot to kill
<TheMaster> high velocity anything will kill something if it hits the right way
<Shizuka> 13there is greater economic benefit as a whole for one prosperous country to not kill another
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: im discussing my opinion.
<Bronysith> not to disable, not to cripple. TO FRICKIN KILL
<Dovah> trollghost: the US has many, many nukes if it came to that well, Fallout
<trollghost> Kandarihu: guns =/= bricks or cars or whatever the hell your logic dictates your side of the argument to say
<Shizuka> 13that does not apply to individual rationality
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: like i saaaid, if the bullet is modified to wound and take out the enemy, its the same thing only doesnt kill
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle as am I
<trollghost> Dovah: yes, BUT IT WOULDNT STOP THE NUKE WIPING YOU OUT
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: the point of a gun is to kill
*Kawaii_icybeauti scoots into the corner and sucks thumb
<TheMaster> and theres no such thing as shooting to wound either. Theres nowhere on the bod that a bullet doesn't do extremely seriously damage.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: but youre not providing any points, youre just saying that im saying nonsense
*Bronysith cuddles with Kawaii_icybeauti
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: what good does that do, now you have someone who still wants to kill you, you're just going to detain them forever and ever?
<Buytoast> oh man, this is beautiful
<Buytoast> on one side we have retard mc gee
<trollghost> oh look, ive been shot and am about to die, lemme just use my 10 guns against this one guy with 1 gun
<Buytoast> on the other rational thought
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, your calling basic knowledge nonesense
<trollghost> oh wait im still dying
<Dovah> trollghost: yeah but the atlantic ocean would and the fact I live nowhere near a prime target for a nuke
<Buytoast> and in the middle of it all a shitstorm over bullets
<BaconMane> 0,5trollghost my foot is going to go so far up your ass
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Jesus, it's an all out debate. I never actually witnessed any of these because the people I'm around all the time are too stupid to think of this.
<Buytoast> this has been a good day to not sleep in
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: why not
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: IKR?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: where do you put them?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eulshy: i never said the word nonsense
<Kandarihu> trollghost, Guns kill individuals, and can be selectively used to prevent innocent people from coming to harm. Nukes kill entire populations and innocent casualties are completely unavoidable.
<trollghost> wow, so it comes down to petty insults and threats when you have nothing else to say
<TheMaster> if theres ever a nuclear war the first thing i'm doing is running towards the nearest blast
<Tovler> inb4 USA is renamed Touhou due to bullet hell.
<TheMaster> because living through a nuclear war is just a recipe for misery
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpy.me/tcM5-
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: jail, where criminals go as it is. not many criminals get killed immediately
<trollghost> Kandarihu: yes im sure that the batman killer carefully picked out who in the audience he shot
<Dovah> trollghost: there is nothing else to say, your being unrational and thats the end of it.
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: trollghost isn't using logic while the others are using rational thought.
<Shizuka> 13because criminals never share information in prison
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: majority of them go to jail as it is
<Dovah> you're*
<Shizuka> 13good
<Kandarihu> trollghost, no he didn't. But the cops who gunned him down sure did.
<Eulshy> twilight_sprinkle, because it is nonsense, what makes you think that if we ban guns people will stop using them, what makes you think that?
<Shizuka> 13what about the ones that don't
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: Ah.
<Shizuka> 13you can't get them all
<TheMaster> gun ownership is intended for small or frail people who otherwise couldn't defend themselves.
<Shizuka> 13the point is, civilian ownership of firearms is first and foremost a deterrent against force
<TheMaster> a gun in the hands of a 90 year old lady levels the playing field against a homeinvader or burgler
<Bronysith> TO BAN GUNS is fucking stupid, that just makes it harder for people to protect themselves
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: im saying that most criminals today go to jail as it is, not killing them wont make much of a dfference space-wise in jail
<Shizuka> 13both from criminals and, principally, your own government
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And some people feel sfaer when they have a gun in their house. It's just a matter of preference.
<trollghost> ok, we in the uk have banned guns
<Spectrum_Rush> TheMaster: if a frail person were to fire a gun, their arm would break
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, do you understand why the U.S. Constitution allows citizens to keep and bear arms?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the government can find ways to take ove ranyway, withotu guns
<trollghost> let me tell you how many people get killed a day from public gun violence
<trollghost> 1
<Dovah> trollghost: good for you?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: not if the populace is armed
<Buytoast> you in the uk also can't put up shit to protect yourself because it might hurt the criminals
<TheMaster> for self defense. if you think random joe with a 9mm can beat the u.s. army you're delusional
<Dovah> we dont really care
<Shizuka> 13see: the american revolution
<Eulshy> you guys are avoiding the actual argument, which is that if you ban guns people will kill people less, which is a rediculous claim
<Tovler> I always wear kelvar when I invade homes.
<RoboGerbil> http://narcissustattoos.deviantart.com/art/Queen-Chrysalis-Tattoo-301880835
<trollghost> how many people get killed in america everyday from gun violence? oh god knows but it sure as hell is way more than 1
<TheMaster> and guns arn't that dangerous to people. i'm not talking about a little old lady firing a .50 cal machine gun from the hip.
<Chrysalis> chrysalis tatoo?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yeah, if the populace is armed too. people dont have tanks, bombers, and they didnt have thse during the revolution
<Buytoast> THIS IS AN AMERICAN CHAT YOU TEA-SUCKING BRIT BOY
<Buytoast> AMERICA
<Shizuka> 13so we shouldn't even give them the most basic level of defense?
<Chrysalis> omfg
<Dovah> Buytoast: lol
<Chrysalis> thats awesome
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, a lone individual with a gun couldn't take on the whole military. That's why a lot of people have to come together to form a militia.
<trollghost> if guns dont kill people, but people kill people with guns, dont give people guns
<Chrysalis> RoboGerbil I WANT ONE
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Buytoast: lawl
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: why if it doesnt change anything since they can be bombed
<Buytoast> take your crumpets and serve them up your ass.
<Shizuka> 13that is..
<Shizuka> 13wow..
<TheMaster> thats why we have the national-guard. the 2nd amendment talks about a well-regulated millitia
<trollghost> sure there will be other forms of killing, but it wont be as easy as with a gun
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: yes? anything besides sarcasm youd like to say?
<Shizuka> 13i can't even begin to comprehend what would lead you do that level of delusion..
<Dovah> trollghost: knife, sword, axe, chainsaw, rock, rabies, i can go on and on
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: so polite, so...above me
<Kandarihu> And keep in mind that that's going to be a last resort. Civil disobediance is the penultimate option.
<Shizuka> 13people could be bombed therefore let's not even give them the ability to deter criminals
<trollghost> but are any of those methods as easy as with a gun
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: forgive me, Your Highness
<TheMaster> but as we're not continiously revolting against our elected officals, which the constitution also says is wrong, it also helps that the 2nd amendment addresses personal self defense.
<Eulshy> Wow
<Dovah> trollghost: yes.
<AJIsAwesome> RoboGerbil: That's amazing.:O
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i alread ysaid what to do with criminals
<Malk> Hello
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kandarihu: But civil disobedience is peaceful.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: complacency
<Sumica> 00,10lets compare populations and lad mass size there trollghost
<NocturnalBlade> hi Malk
<trollghost> can someone go into a liberal teens camp and stab 81 people? or hit 81 people to death with a rock
<trollghost> i doubt it
<Sumica> 00,10land*
<AJIsAwesome> Malk: Hello!
<Buytoast> So trollghost, maybe if you had some of these guns, hitler wouldn't of made you have to come crawling to the PATRIOTS to save your sorry crumpet butts from doom, eh?
<Buytoast> MURIKA
<Kandarihu> Kawaii_icybeauti, that's why it's prefered over military force.
<TheMaster> if the framers and founders of the constitution intended you to plot to overthrow their government they wouldn't have given the president the power to suspend habeus corpus in times of revolt if he wishes.
<Eulshy> trollghost, if they know what there doing yes
<Tovler> Militias should have access to Surface to Air missiles.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: anyway im too inferior to keep this up, andi have classes, goodbye
<Sumica> 00,10Buytoast, stop that line of logic right now
<Shizuka> 13TheMaster: and yet, second amendment
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kandarihu: I could see how that could actually work.
<trollghost> Sumica: lets compare nigerias landsize to americas, pretty smaller right
<Buytoast> let us join together and sing the national anthem
<TheMaster> is for the states to form their millitias and for citizens to also protect themselves from criminals
<Dovah> has knive in jacket sleeve walk past someone and quickly slit their throat and continue walking.
<TheMaster> the national guard is basically what the framers intended.
<trollghost> ok dovah go do that to 81 people with noone noticing and running away
<Dovah> hey look i just killed someone without a gun and it was easy as fuck to do
<Tovler> My Little Pony. My Little Pony. aaaAAaaaAAhh
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, yeah
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Someone was freakin shot under my window when I was a baby. Guess that's why I'm scared of loud noises to this day.
<MadSurge> :D CMC Astronauts :D
<Sumica> 00,10war torn thirld world country has noting to do with this trollghost
<Malk> TheMaster the united states was ment to be more like the eu or greek city states than a huge cenrtalized national government
<Eulshy> Shizuka, I'm fairly certain that if these types of arguments come up, we should just not go with them, ban the people who started them for a bit and not have these arguments on this chat
<TheMaster> its not guns that are scary. its criminals that are scary.
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's getting old
<TheMaster> you're blaming the wrong thing
<RoboGerbil> would anyone be interested in roleplaying is magic?
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: I would be scared too O__o
<Buytoast> man, trollghost is grasping for more straws than the scarecrow when he was fucked up by them flying monkeys
<Dovah> trollghost: ok just make sure you pay my bail. and all the law suites because eventually I will be found
<Shizuka> 13the base premise of the argument in favor of banning guns has been thoroughly destroyed
<trollghost> Sumica: but according to you cars, rocks, pianos and other heavy impliments do
<Kandarihu> Any level of government can be corrupted. That's why there has to be checks and balances at every level. ONE of those checks are bound to kick in
<TheMaster> I disagree. if you read the federalist papers the founders make a strong case for a centralized government. maybe that argument could be made for the original confederacy made.
<trollghost> Dovah: i wont
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: There was a storm this morning, and I'm practically as scared as my dog of thunder. It's wuiet depressing actually.
<TheMaster> but the constitution is fairly centeralized
<Eulshy> Shizuka, time to end this conversation
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should move onto another subject.....:S
<Eulshy> or debate
<Sumica> 00,10no that was just the stupidity of lets outlaw things that kill argument you opend with
<trollghost> brb guys gonna go get a drink, give twilight_sprinkle your bullshit for a minute
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But thanks to Woodrow Wilson, he pretty much handed to coutnry to fat cats.
<Dovah> trollghost: then i cant do what you asked, well i could but there would be no benefit to me
<NocturnalBlade> trollghost: twilight_sprinkle left, had class
<Buytoast> well, now that the rabble rouser is gone
<Eulshy> Guys can we just have a policy that if people start these arguments to just ban them for a bit
<TheMaster> its hard to say where it really starts Kawaii. All presidents build executive power off of previous administrations
<Kawaii_icybeauti> No way, he left?
<Buytoast> oh say can you see
<TheMaster> roleplaying is magic? whats that anyway
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: Do you play videogames? And if yes, what's your fav genre?
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, the constitution gives the federal government very limited powers and requires that the states take care of everything else.
<Eli> i went for a round of tf2 and i come back to... this?
<Eulshy> what is roleplaying is magic?
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I do. I don't have a favorite IMO.
<NocturnalBlade> Eli: thats bronystate for ya lol
<MadSurge> Eli: replace that with Braid and that's me :D
<Eulshy> Eli, the topic is trying to be changed
<TheMaster> well to be honest if you look at what came before the constitution it was a huge expansion of federal power.
<Malk> Ya what is roleplaying is magic?
<Dovah> perma ban trollghost? all in favor say 'I'
<Eulshy> TheMaster, drop it
<Spectrum_Rush> Eulshy: there is a policy, it wasnt broken yet
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Comes to think of it, ew York is probably the most controlled state out of all of them. You can't buy fireworks here, menus need to have the calories on them...It sucks :P
<Eulshy> Everyone peole drop the argument
<Shizuka> 13Dovah: i would but it's better to take the moral high road and let people discredit themselves
<TheMaster> why can't we have a discussion?
<Shizuka> 13in other news issac made landfall i believe
<TheMaster> nobody is mad or flaming
<Kandarihu> Eli, I think the gun debate is from a part of an episode of Mythbusters that Sumica was streaming, that was talking about a theory about starting fires with guns by removing the bullet.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Nopony is down there, right?
<Dovah> Shizuka: you and your mod logic
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Yep.
<Shizuka> 13at least i know the RNC is gavelling in and out today to resume tomorrow
<Kandarihu> I completely disagree with just about everything that trollghost says. But I'm against permabanning him.
<Buytoast> permaban him
<Buytoast> FOR AMERICA
<AJIsAwesome> Can we all just calm down? We all have different opinions.
<Malk> mabye the solution is to have a diffrent channel if you wnat to talk about it
<Eli> how about we talk about my favorite theme: music
<Tovler> Isaac Hayes is best Scientologist.
<AJIsAwesome> Even if some aren't the most logical.
<Eulshy> Whatis friend ship is roleplaying?
<Dovah> in other news, no stream?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I wated the hurricane to be names scrambles....
<Kandarihu> If we permaban someone for having bad opinions, the next person to be permabanned might be me.
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: ditto, would be undermining our own argument... after all stupidity doesn't go away just because you ban it :3
<Shizuka> 13just look at reality tv
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: ikr, gun debate is just flame wars bait
<Dovah> Kandarihu: fine 3 hours ban?
<Dovah> Three. Hours. Dungeon.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Ikr :D
<Kandarihu> Whatever. Back when I honorbanned myself, I started with much worse.
<Spectrum_Rush> and yet it didnt become a flame war it was aheated debate at most
<Eli> Kandarihu: an opinion can't really be "bad"
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Shizuka: Point.
<Tovler> Earl of Lemongrab returns tonight
<Kandarihu> Eli, true
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: ONE MILLION YEARS DUNGEON!
<Eli> Kandarihu: it's just your opinion. if you say your own opinion is bad you're doing it wrong
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: is that from Adventure Time? I don't watch that o__o
<Tovler> I thought the George Zimmerman should be free due to biased media coverage was a terrible opinion.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> coconut pie ish good
<Dovah> I want this: http://tonyrogers.com/images/weapons/metalstorm/metal_storm.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Yep. But it's okay. You don't have to watch it if you don't want to.
<Malk> You cant someones opinion is bad and it be a fact its just your opinion
<Shizuka> 13need longer range radar on the east coast
<Spectrum_Rush> Tovler: those attempts at subject change
<trollghost> im back
<Buytoast> oh beautiful
<alexxm> how you doing trollghost
<Buytoast> for spacious skies
<Shizuka> 13can't tell if isaac fell apart or if it's just satellite storms hitting florida atm
<Kawaii_icybeauti> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BbRffBCeYw
<trollghost> and you know what, you guys have made me realise how good it is that guns are legal
<Spectrum_Rush> ya dont say
<trollghost> and how i can shoot someone because its so easy
<Eulshy> What Is Friendship is Roleplaying, i heard someone say it
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: eh, not really...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Shizuka: I was watching CNN earlier, and I saw that it was aiming more toward Louisiana. Florida only got this one piece of rain and stuff.
<NocturnalBlade> trollghost: ok, just drop it dude
<trollghost> and how even though they are illegal i can buy them at my local gun delaer
<Buytoast> oh boy, here comes the big boy IM GONNA SHOOT YA ALL threat
<MadSurge> Eulshy: I think it's a fanfic where the mane 6 play Dungeons and Dragons :D
<trollghost> so tommorow, im gonna buy a gun, and im gonna go shoot some people
<Shizuka> 13i can almost make out what might be the northern edge of the spiral in the gulf
<trollghost> thx guys
<Shizuka> 13but the radars barely make it out there
<Malk> trollghost I can buy them from walmart
<AJIsAwesome> trollghost: We stopped talking about this a long time ago. Stop.:|
<Sumica> 00,10right that's the last nail
<Eulshy> ban hammer?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> trollghost see ya
<Tovler> I think I've forgotten how to take a gun apart.
<Buytoast> man, he just gave right up at the end there

<MadSurge> BAN HAMMER
<PillowPoni> Inb4 kick/ban

<trollghost> kk
<Sumica> 00,10I'll catch it on the news then trollghost
<MadSurge> :O SUPER ROBOT WARS!
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, we have clearly stated rules against trolling.

<PillowPoni> Oh hell *hides* its the hammer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> trollghost don't drope the soap in jail
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> drop*

<MadSurge> Hello Caramel! :)
<NocturnalBlade> hi Applejack2012
<Buytoast> is trollghost still in here?
<Ponies47> Hey Applejack2012
<Kandarihu> And as much as people disagree with my views, I do NOT TROLL!
<Tovler> you can drop the soap, just don't pick it up
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh look a stream
<Malk> Whats the stream??
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Buytoast not anymore
<Applejack2012> Its alive!
<Caramel> howdy

<Sumica> 00,10trolling kills we need to outlaw that too
<TheMaster> aw yeah. ttgl time
<MadSurge> Shizuka: that means it died down a bit, right?
<Shizuka> 13yeah down from hurricane i think
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: oh u
<NocturnalBlade> Shizuka: yea thats good, i think it was comin towards my state so i'm glad it dropped
<Shizuka> 13looks like landfall will be louisiana
<RaveBrony> :o
<Tovler> Isaac is gonna raise oil prices and kill people I don't care about.
<Spectrum_Rush> weather kills, ban it
<Kandarihu> Eulshy, I speak my mind because oftentimes, I feel the need to voice them. That's debate. Trolling is saying things just to get a reaction. And it's very broadly categorized nowadays.
<NocturnalBlade> Shizuka: oh, now its louisiana? last time i saw it it was goin more north
<Shizuka> 13i get the feeling it's pushing warm air up here though cause minnesota is like upper 80s all week
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica can we ban laws too ? they kill people
<Malk> A lot of good arguments are spoiled by some fool who knows what he is talking about.
<Kandarihu> But being as serious as I am when I debate can seldom be confused with trolling.
<Shizuka> 13the purple probability range is right around louisiana, but of mississipi
<alexxm> i have no idea whats going on
<Shizuka> 13bit of rather
<Malk> Shizuka purple range?
<Spectrum_Rush> Alchemist: it not important anymore
<PillowPoni> Hope those people in louisiana are prepared, especially new orleans
<Shizuka> 13highest probability where tropical storm force winds will be
<Spectrum_Rush> woops
<Shizuka> 13the link i have above
<Eli> alexxm: we ran out of topics.... sooo... the weather
<Tovler> I think about Animal Crossing too much to have a focused argument on social commentary.
<Alchemist> Spectrum_Rush: its okay. Random pings remind me that the tab is open :D
<TheMaster> i'm sure we're missing a lot of hot blooded awesome because we dont' read japanese
<TheMaster> go with the giga drill breaker
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: Yep.:D
<Kandarihu> And then, I have STRANGE ideas, which I honestly hold, but I expect people to find funny anyway.
<alexxm> Eli i meant i don't speak japanese and the streams a japanese game
<Eli> oh... well, neither do I :P
<Brony> Hai everypony
<Malk> WShizuka hope it goes through texas and bring down our temepatures

<Applejack2012> hi
<Spectrum_Rush> Alchemist: i know the feel every time Spell_of_Gaming enters the chat :D
<Shizuka> 13hear hear, bring on autumn already
<Brony> is that a game?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: The fact that you express your opinions with rational thought is fine by me. I'm glad you openly express yourself, even if people don't like your opinions
<Shizuka> 13doesn't look like any rain will make it up here this week, probably all the warm air getting pushed up by isaac
<NocturnalBlade> Brony: yes it is
<AJIsAwesome> Brony: Hello!
<alexxm> ah so anti spiral campaign is happening
<Spectrum_Rush> i like rain
<Applejack2012> Yay bring on autumn
<AJIsAwesome> Brony: Are you new here?
<Kandarihu> For instance, I honestly wish Issac WOULD hit Florida, and the RNC would just hold the convention through it anyway. That way, the OWS Black Block wouldn't be able to do JACK to them.
<Spectrum_Rush> and autumn
<Sumica> 00,10the down side to time bans, having to figure out how many min in a day =p
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Tovler> but OWS doesn't exist.
<Brony> AJIsAwesome: uhm yea
<Maid_RainBow> Dat evil moon
<Shizuka> 13iirc they're gavelling in and out to make it official, just postponing til tomorrow, so it's kind of there for solidarity
<TheMaster> oh so you're fighting the anti-spirals now?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: 24 ÷ 60?
<NocturnalBlade> well then welcome Brony
<TheMaster> does this mean that the final boss of super robot wars is the anti-spiral?
<Sumica> 00,1024x60

<Maid_RainBow> breasts on fire?

<Polydunami> Ugh, my ad is some "russian" girl making a kissy face xP
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #546 - Epic Edition!
<Shizuka> 13dvd took like a year to get to the us didn't it?
<Shizuka> 13felt like ages
<Bronysith> oh hey its that one guy
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Shizuka
<Bronysith> its that one guy from code geass
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: adblock, come on you've been here long enough
<Caramel> Suzaku
<Bronysith> SUZAKU thats it
<Marx> Yeah, so I had a wierd dream today.
<Sumica> 00,10mind you I dont use the useal routs to get things like that
<Shizuka> 13ryu suzaku, captain falcon?
<Polydunami> I don't really care, Spectrum_Rush :D
<TheMaster> thats one tough anti spiral ship
<Bronysith> Caramel: he can survive on a diet of crayons and lighter fluid
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: but its freeeeeeeeee
<Polydunami> But it's funny :3
<TheMaster> i think the green ships need the giga drill breaker
<Marx> It was actually a pony dream. In the dream, I was watching Friendship is Magic, and it was a Derpy episode.
<Spectrum_Rush> bounce
<Shizuka> 13two points of damage!
<Malk> #spike
<Sumica> 00,10lolwut, survay guy calls me and wants me to press keys to answer quesions
<Polydunami> Hmm? Someone playing with the ball or something? :S
<alexxm> too much effort to kill one guy
<Sumica> 00,10but it was a live caller not a machine
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: 2 ballons maybe :S
<Tovler> DRAWFRIEND!
<Sumica> 00,10"press one if you are male, press 2 if you are female"
<Shizuka> 13sumica you just got called by skynet!
<Sumica> 00,10I press 3
<alexxm> is gaogaigar in this
<Marx> I don't remember all the details, but in this dream episode, it was centered around this race or something. Derpy was assigned this one job relating to the race. I can't remember what the heck it was...
<Polydunami> Balloons are fun :3
<Caramel> gaogaigar was in a previous one
<alexxm> ok Caramel
<Polydunami> Well Marx, get to animatin' :3
<Sumica> 00,10he said that is not a valed keypress
<Sumica> 00,10so I said oh sorry i though that was the go fuckyour self button.
<Shizuka> 13clearly you have a girly voice :3
<TheMaster> how about streaming TTGL. ever do that Sumi?
<Sumica> 00,10I have thought about it but I belive Val was showing that
<Kandarihu> That reminds me of that game Wrek was playing yesterday.
<Caramel> I was, yeah
<Polydunami> I'll be back later, everypony. Going to a memorial service
<Sumica> 00,10val being Caramel
<Polydunami> I'm out
<Rain> oh val is playing this game again? :3c
<Malk> Anypony up for MvM game?
<Sumica> 00,10where did he just pull that sword from?
<Rain> his ass, Sumica :p
<Marx> So they have their race. I guess it was a pegasus race. They do the race, but near the end, something happened that caused all the racers to crash into the ground. Derpy noticed it, and she tries to fix things I think? Idk, but what she did was I think somehow pick everybody up, fly to the finish line, sort everybody out before the finish line in a totally random order, and then Derpy proceeds to take 1st place.
<TheMaster> he pulled it from...his heart
<TheMaster> hot bloodedness is always the answer
<Chrysalis> now i remember why i pirate films
<Chrysalis> cause buying them is a PITA
<gonzal3> harro
<alexxm> PITA?
<Chrysalis> Pain in the ass
<Sumica> 00,10voltron?
<TheMaster> is that some voltron?
<Marx> It was kind of a wierd dream, but yeah. I don't remember if there was a lesson at the end.
<Caramel> ...
<Caramel> why does everyone call GodMars Voltron?
<gonzal3> make love to me :D
<Sumica> 00,10hehehe
<Chrysalis> seriously, pirates get such a better experience with films
<Eulshy> Whats with the voltron force?
<Marx> Derpy counted really fast though. Even I had trouble keeping up with her.
<alexxm> gonzal3 are you man or woman
<Sumica> 00,10cause it looks like voltron
<gonzal3> I fuck fish anyone wanna join and where the fuck are the ponys D:
<gonzal3> I wanna mlp fim ):
<Sumica> 00,10and then it's setsuna f gundun,
<MASF123> Stupid Sexy Flanders! D:
<Applejack2012> I want fim too
<Shizuka> 13oo you can send entities through nether portals in the new snapshot
<Rain> there already is one, gonzal3
<Chrysalis> MASF123 wearing nothing at all
<Rain> what, Shizuka?
<gonzal3> thanks rain :D
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<gonzal3> 6_9 love derpy
<Marx> So yeah, thought I'd share my crazy dream. Maybe something like that will happen one day? Or someone maybe just got inspired and they'll make a fanfiction out of it?
<Rain> are you playing teh minecraft, Shizuka? :3c
<Shizuka> 13you can push cows and pigs and stuff through nether portals and they'll come out the other side
<Applejack2012> loe derpy too
<Shizuka> 13just reading the details of the new snapshots
<Applejack2012> love
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yay Mole for lunch :p
<MASF123> Chrysalis...nothing at all...nothing sat all...nothing at all.... D:
<Rain> that sounds awesome, Shizuka :3
<gonzal3> :P
<TheMaster> all that for less then 7000
<Sumica> 00,10do portals have to be vertical?
<Agrold> there's also invisibility potions in this new update.. that you can throw at creepers
<Chrysalis> Sumica vanially ones yes
<Kandarihu> I can't hear this guy's voice and not think Franky
<Chrysalis> vanilla ones*
<Sumica> 00,10bah
<Sumica> 00,10I want portal traps
<Rain> ^
<Chrysalis> Mystcraft does some really nice things with portals
<Chrysalis> including portals of any size/shape
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka you can push items so if you buil an automatic wheat farm you can pick up everything when you go to the nether
<Chrysalis> and ones which makes people going through drop all their items
<Shizuka> 13no no no better, have like two nether portals and a canal between them in the nether
<Shizuka> 13wheat goes in one, pops out half a km away in your house~
<Chrysalis> Shizuka except no water in the nether
<Sumica> 00,10that was one thought I was having too Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13if you hax the water tile into your inventory you can~
<Shizuka> 13i think it's item 9
<Shizuka> 13or 10
<Marx> Now that's an awesome idea Shizuka.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka could be but the point is if you are not in the nether the items do not despawn
<Chrysalis> wonder if carts work
<Chrysalis> cause then you can just use a chest cart
<Shizuka> 13yeah hopefully that makes carts work
<Shizuka> 13that will be awesome
<Agrold> Chrysalis: cart's doesn't work through portals, not yet at least
<Sumica> 00,10then again if you have build craft you dont need portals
<Sumica> 00,10just lots of pipe.
<Sumica> 00,10and the abilty to not explode the pumps
<Shizuka> 13i might have to put tekkit together
<Shizuka> 13when minecraft gets boring for me... it's sudden and massive...
<Chrysalis> Shizuka if you want i can just give you my pack
<Spectrum_Rush> lots and lots and lots of pipes
<Chrysalis> pretty much tekkit, with a few extras
<Chrysalis> and someof the boring mods taken out
<Chrysalis> and multiplayer
<sagas> Its always Caramel and his japanese mechs
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i have trouble keeping my systems cool when using pumps
<Chrysalis> still 1.2.5 though till later next month when the bigger mods hit

<Marx> Well, I think you killed it.

<BlazeAngel> NEIN!
<Shizuka> 13THIS ISN'T EVEN HIS FINAL FORM
<superretroworld> Tovler: what do you mean?
<BlazeAngel> Shizu, hold this. *Hands orange*
<Tovler> I don't even compare MLP to 90s shows my 12 year old self loved.
<alexxm> did kitan even do this in gurren lagann
<Marx> And that attack failed.
<Tovler> I don't remember Smurfs at all outside of Gargamel, Papa Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Smurfette, Jokey...

<Obsidian> Only bad if my house loses power at any second

<Eli> SuperBrony64: i said "here hold this."
<Chrysalis> /me diffuses the bomb that SuperBrony64 is holding
<Barbetos|AtWork> SuperBrony64: its better to no ask questions at this point.

<Barbetos|AtWork> SuperBrony64: Don't do what Johny did, and assume time has frozen. it won't end well.
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: I just hope you don't fall into the same trap as Johnny Bravo and believe time has stopped.
<MASF123> SuperBrony64, that beeping...that means it working? Or is it an alarm? Hit the snooze button will ya?
<Chrysalis> voice for BlazeAngel
<Chrysalis> ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The beeping and vibrating means the thing is about to hit 500 degrees.
<tSparx> Wait, is this a TTGL game? I didn't know that existed.
<MASF123> ...500 degrees?
<JacknAppleLover> SuperBrony64: beep the fuck boop - SivHD

<tSparx> Malk Kk then ;)
<Applejack2012> just okay too
<JacknAppleLover> Have it entirely downloaded and still watch the ending episode every now and again
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: it's got so much health!
<tSparx> SuperBrony64: Please, Anti-Spiral Flying Circus Tent
<MASF123> SuperBrony64 is NOW offically a ticking time bomb
<Malk> tSparx she wanted to know what its like to be a pony in my army.:$
<tSparx> I've been meaning to watch Gurren-hen and Lagann-hen
<MASF123> I always wanted to say that. :)
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: watch it man
<MaidWhite> So whats on stream, I've seen this game before, but its name escapes me.
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: but, dont gtive up on the first 3 or 4 episodes, which i admit are TERRIBAD
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: Aren't they really just rehashes of the series?
<Caramel> SRW Z2: SaiSeiHen
<Eli> i don't watch animes... i prefer reading
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: No I'm talking about the movies. I've watched the whole series twice through.
<MadSurge> MaidWhite: Super Robot Wars, but I dunno which game
<MaidWhite> MadSurge: Danke
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: ah didnt fully read comment, i see now
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: if u mean the OVA's they are kinda like musik videos
<tSparx> Eli: I usually prefer manga to anime, but I don't think the TTGL manga's really that good
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: the movie is just a recap of each season yes
<MadSurge> I like both western and japanese cartoons... if they're good.
<tSparx> ^^
<tSparx> dat
<Kandarihu> http://xkcd.com/1099/ <- MUGEN WIIIIIIIIIIINGS!
<Eli> tSparx: yeah, i'm still not watching it... i just can't come to terms with anime. i don't wanna watch tehm with subtitles, but the dubs are mostly horrible
<MadSurge> So that weird thing is from Gurren Langan?
<JacknAppleLover> CODE GEASS BITCHES
<tSparx> MadSurge: Aye
<Maid_RainBow> is Hero still in this game? and wing zero
<Caramel> yes
<MadSurge> Oh, time for Lelouch? :D
<MadSurge> Welp, one hit and it's dead
<Everlasting_Joy> Finish him off!
<MadSurge> MISSED :D
<tSparx> Eli: I can't stand dubs, even the best ones still suck compared to the Japanese voice-actor's. But I even watch a lot of English things with subs, because sometimes I have a hard time turning noise into language, so watching anime with subs is really like watching most other things for me
<tSparx> Oh wow that was a wall o' text haha my bad
<Kandarihu> I was hoping you'd cherry tap him, but overkill is nice too.
<MadSurge> GURREN LANGAN TIME
<tSparx> GIGA DRILL
<alexxm> that pleased me
<MadSurge> DED
<Tovler> I love dubs. I can look away for a second and still follow the story.
<Eli> tSparx: sometimes it's a good thing to have a crazy mind like mine. Mangas are completly alive in my head. that's more than I need, screw animes :P
<MadSurge> NEW OBJECTIVE
*Jmo pokes Pearly
<tSparx> So where did some of these new chars come from? I definitely don't recognize everyone and their ganmen, but I just watched the re-watched the series like two weeks ago.
<tSparx> just re-watched*
<MadSurge> Is that a character from an anime or a Super Robot Wars OC? :D
<Caramel> OC
<MadSurge> Thanks Caramel
<Maid_RainBow> lol
<Obsidian> only 10 pts
<Maid_RainBow> 10 Crit Damage
<NocturnalBlade> lol all that effort...10 damage
<MadSurge> ENEMY PHASE
<Caramel> Wall spirit command
<Caramel> makes the next attack do 10 damage
<Caramel> useful for mechs like Ganleon that don't dodge as often
<tSparx> So who's streaming, and do they know Japanese?
<MadSurge> Caramel: Ah, that's awesome :D
<Caramel> like this time
<Caramel> it'll do actual damage
<Caramel> since my wall activated on his first hit
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: caramel is streaming and i dont know if they do
<Maid_RainBow> again 10 Crit Damage i bet
<MadSurge> Oh noes!
<Everlasting_Joy> Well someone got nailed.
<MadSurge> :D she's so happy
<Barbetos|AtWork> He was NAILED. Get it? GET IT!?
<Jmo> Wow Barbetos|AtWork >_>
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: YES I DO
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Tail: A Story of Time and Forgiveness
<Barbetos|AtWork> I tell angry jokes
<MadSurge> YOKO! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> yolo?
<tSparx> They didn't get Yoko's VA from the anime?
<JacknAppleLover> YORO, you only ride once.
<Everlasting_Joy> JacknAppleLover: You only read once?
<JacknAppleLover> Everlasting_Joy: now why would i only read once? that would be the death of Twilight
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: And Rainbowdash
<Everlasting_Joy> JacknAppleLover: :).
<tSparx> Rainbow Dash*
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: true but she would break the rules anyway
<MASF123> POLO- Ponies Only Live Once
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: True :)
<JacknAppleLover> POLO - a game i play with ponies
<JacknAppleLover> HECARIM - the undead pony of death and tower dives
<Eli> YORO sounds like a bad writer name...
<MadSurge> Go Nagai time! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Opops
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hope those planets he it weren't important.
<MadSurge> HOLY SHIT
<Tovler> MLG - Men Lacking Girlfriends
<JacknAppleLover> Dear Princess celestria, Why are you not a Queenie?
<MadSurge> Tovler: :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Barbetos|AtWork: I was thinking the same thing.
<MaidWhite> Why would you cut through the planets, that would decrease the strength of your attack
<Caramel> BECAUSE THAT'S NOT AWESOME
<tSparx> MaidWhite: It's TTGL, don't question it. If it's awesome, it'll happen.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Eli> and if yoro is "you only ride once", ohoho believe me, when you're riding skills are as bad as mine YOU ONLY RIDE ONCE
<MaidWhite> ...True
<JacknAppleLover> MaidWhite: you forget he has WILLPOWER!!
<Caramel> that wasn't TTGL...
<Caramel> that was Getter Robo...
<MadSurge> MaidWhite: Anime Logic, the more awesome it looks the more damage it does
<JacknAppleLover> MadSurge: and the louder you scream
<MadSurge> JacknAppleLover: that too :D
<tSparx> Caramel: I'm talking about the anime as a whole, you don't even have TTGL out, do you, it's just GL.
<MaidWhite> Wah, I was using normal logic, silly me,
<Caramel> what? I have all of the TTGL characters out...
<MadSurge> SING FOR YOUR FRIENDS! :D
<Vivix> I'm back, darlings
<Caramel> this is the TTGL second to last mission...
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Vivix.
<Jmo> OH FINALLY Vivix
<Vivix> Hiya
<Jmo> ONLY TOOK YOU SEVERAL HOURS.
<JacknAppleLover> MadSurge: BECAUSE SINGING GIVES ME STRENNNGGGTHHHHH!!!
<Vivix> Yees, JMO
<Jmo> 'BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES'
<tSparx> Caramel: Oy. "It's TTGL [The show] don't question it." "You don't even have TTGL [the ganmen] out, do you?"
<Vivix> How you know I was playing ;__;?
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Barbetos|AtWork> Something has bothered me everytime I have seen you play this Caramel. Why are they all level 99?
<Jmo> ;~;
<Rain> KING KITAN!
<Caramel> Barbetos: because you didn't watch me when I first played through it
*JacknAppleLover throws a sadine at Jmo for no reason
<Caramel> this is like, my 10th newgame+
<MadSurge> Hello Rain! :)
<Caramel> soon I'll have hardmode unlocked
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ah. Okay. I was curious if that was why.
<MadSurge> Almost dead!
<Barbetos|AtWork> And then one more with a lot of HP.
<tSparx> Caramel: I wish TTGL didn't refer to multiple things so that it were less confusing, haha.
<JacknAppleLover> Caramel: 日本語 bitch do you speak it?
<MadSurge> MAZINGER TIME
<superretroworld> does anybody think next season they just have a simple love sotry between big mac and cheerlies relationship?
<Marx> Somebody broke out Bullet Punch.
<tSparx> Superretroworld We don't know.
<JacknAppleLover> Scissor used bullet punch? op
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well
<tSparx> superretroworld: And if we did, we wouldn't be at liberty to say.
<MadSurge> DED
<Eli> superretroworld: BigMac and RD :P
<Vivix> I kinda hope not, but if they do
<MadSurge> OH COME OOOOOOON
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rarity and Spike is all you GET
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> ;__; stopeet
<Jmo> A FEW MINUTES YOU SAID.
<Vivix> Unexpected visitoors
<baka52> ITS TOOL TIME!
<Vivix> we went sightseeing in La Noir
<Barbetos|AtWork> Vivix: you smell like fish.
<Jmo> Oh right, fair enough.
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<tSparx> baka52 THE BAND!?
<superretroworld> Eli: big mac and fluttershy would be epic too
*Vivix smells like fish
<Jmo> Feeeeesh
<Barbetos|AtWork> I hope canon story stays the hell away from shipping.
<tSparx> I personally hope there's just as little romance in ssn 3 as in prior.
<JacknAppleLover> superretroworld: Is Fluttershy drunk again?
<Caramel> Barbetos: that's the first logical/non crazy thing a brony has said to me all day
<Vivix> Barbetos|AtWork agreed, mostly because shipping freedom, but also because shipping just tends to--complicate and kill series
<Eli> superretroworld: that with RD was a joke :) I have nothing against the idea of her being hetero, but i don't see any stallion in the story that would match her
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: or at least ambiguous shipping like it did until now
<magmablock> what an annoying voice
<superretroworld> JacknAppleLover: shes that shy isnt she?
<MadSurge> magmablock: who, the guy or the girl? :D
<magmablock> MadSurge: The girl
<superretroworld> Eli: thats true
<JacknAppleLover> Eureka
<MadSurge> magmablock: heard worse
<JacknAppleLover> is the final version of Nirvash on this?
<MadSurge> WUT, QUESTION MARK HEALTH???
<Caramel> yes
<JacknAppleLover> ooo awesome
<Caramel> and I will not deploy it
<tSparx> baka52 Are you talking about Tool the band?
<Caramel> because that shit is a blight upon what was an amazing show
<JacknAppleLover> u dont like the final version?
<Caramel> only because it mostly is in the movie
<Maid_RainBow> Caramel : is Hero still in this game with Wing Zero?
<Caramel> whereas it has a very BRIEF moment in the show
<JacknAppleLover> ok, i didnt watch movie
<Barbetos|AtWork> MadSurge: it has confusing amounts of health.
<Caramel> Maid_Rainbow: already answered that. Yes he is
<JacknAppleLover> i dont usually like the movies of series already made
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: oh, I see :D
<Maid_RainBow> Diddent see that Caramel sorry
<JacknAppleLover> Caramel: u speak japanese then?
<Caramel> it's possible
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/825
<Maid_RainBow> For the Empire !!!
<Jmo> Vivix, I knew what you were doing cause I'm psychic.
<tSparx> During Euro movie-night I was thinking about how much time we spend on chat repeating information for people -- this is especially true on movie night xD
<Jmo> ;~;
<JacknAppleLover> Caramel: why you didn't reply earlier then? :\
<JacknAppleLover> Caramel: meanine :c
<Vivix> Jmo the medium, crystal ball and all
<Caramel> unless you didn't realize, I'm a bit busy
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: He's busy saving the world.
<MadSurge> ^
<Caramel> I'm actually saving many dimensions as well
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: doesnt the almighty caramelhave time for his bitches?
<Caramel> but that's not till later
<Maid_RainBow> Caramel : why are these Japanes games os Awesome?
<Caramel> because they are
<JacknAppleLover> japanese *fixed
<Everlasting_Joy> Ha! He missed, he needs glasses.
<tSparx> JacknAppleLover: Not when he's fighting anti-spirals!
<MadSurge> DODGED
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: those bastards! D: whatever will i do
<JacknAppleLover> MadSurge: if you can dodge a planet sized laserbeam, u can dodge a wrench.
<tSparx> Hey look, it's a gundam!
<JacknAppleLover> im gonna watch that again, i love that movie
<Marx> A head-on body slam only did 10 damage.
<Caramel> Marx: whenever you see one of my mechs take 10 damage, it's because I used the Wall spirit command
<Caramel> which makes the next enemy attack do 10 damage
<Marx> Ah.
<tSparx> Another gundam!
<tSparx> I now really want Gundam and TTGL to be the same canon haha
<JacknAppleLover> ok lovelies, im going to watch Dodgeball, i just really want to watch that movie
<tSparx> Bye JacknAppleLover :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care JacknAppleLover.
<JacknAppleLover> tSparx: byeee

<superretroworld> michael bays favourite game
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: whos dat?
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Just a minute before you joined.
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: wut did he do?
<tSparx> twilight_sprinkle: Idk, not sure I've seen him around before. He went to watch Dodgeball.
<Applejack2012> I killed the chat! :)
*Panda|DrawingPoni shadow glomps twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> tSparx: mkay
<Spectrum_Rush> ('.')b thumbs up
<Marx> Huh, music sounded like SNES Sector Y for a minute.
<MadSurge> superretroworld: nah, the robots are too distinguishable and there's no annoying stereotype!
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|DrawingPoni: woah, youre a ninja-glomper? O.o
<Panda|DrawingPoni> twilight_sprinkle yush!
<Marx> Or I think I mean Sector X. One of those two.
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|DrawingPoni: awshum!
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: That, that is so true.
<superretroworld> MadSurge: yeah good point
<MadSurge> Almost dead!
<tSparx> MadSurge: Hm, surely there's gotta be *some* annoying stereotype in TTGL.
<twilight_sprinkle> i just got back from my math lecture, it had so much earrape. the teachers mic kept feedbacking and it was so painful, but fun
<tSparx> MadSurge: Well, consider him dead now. GIGA DRILL BREAKER!
*Pearly pokes Jmo
<MadSurge> SO MUCH DED
<Pearly> Pearly is here
<tSparx> Hey Pearly
<Everlasting_Joy> There's no kill quite like overkill :).
*Jmo glomps Pearly
<Jmo> PEEARRRRRLLLLLLYYYYY~
<tSparx> I like the things you do. Hey Pearly! If I could I would glomp you.
<MadSurge> UBER DED
<Marx> I think you killed it...
<tSparx> Ahaha, MadSurge: until Ssn 2, Viral was a pretty stereotypical, annoying rival for Kamina then Simon.
<MadSurge> OH COME OOOON
<Pearly> tSparx, sure go for it
<tSparx> I mean, I love him, even in ssn 1, so maybe he's not an annoying stereotype... hmm...
<tSparx> Pearly: Well I meant in person. Of course I can glomp you here! *glomps*
<Sumica> 00,10that sounded like that one mussled pegisis
<Pearly> oh sure in person would be nice
<MadSurge> BARELY SCRATCHED IT
<Pearly> tSparx, where from?
<tSparx> Pearly: Mostly I just wanted to finish out that reference.
<tSparx> Pearly: Where what from?
<tSparx> If you mean me, I'm from St. Louis.
<DrSteveSCARz> Hows it goin everypony :)
<tSparx> Which is in MO, midwest USA
<Sumica> 00,10Caramel, you gonna need a bigger mech
<cowvarkian> so, caramel
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy DrSteveSCARz.
<tSparx> Sumica What he needs is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
<Caramel> sumica: there are always bigger mechs :P
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Pearly> ahh I am from california
<DrSteveSCARz> the chat seems to be a victim of 1st degree murder.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<MadSurge> THAT WAS MURDER
<tSparx> DrSteveSCARz: We're just moving at a kinda slow pace, but we're far from dead.
<Everlasting_Joy> DrSteveSCARz: It's quiet, but we're managing, I guess.
<Jmo> o-o
<cowvarkian> Not yet dead
<DrSteveSCARz> Dont let the flame die out.
<MadSurge> I like this slow pace, opposed to the insanity of live episodes
<cowvarkian> heh
<tSparx> MadSurge: Holy crap, movie night was awful. Like, I enjoyed it, but I can only do that once or twice a week, haha
<Vivix> Why is there a suomi bronystate-
*Jmo nomths Vivix
*Vivix likcs Jmo's teeth
<DrSteveSCARz> Whats this being streamed?
<MadSurge> tSparx: :O it's not awful!
<Jmo> o.o
<Maid_RainBow> i have to hit the hay everypony goodnight
*Vivix is one of those cleaning fish
<Sumica> 00,10dont know Vivix, but they are not bronystate
<Obsidian> Night Maid_RainBow
<superretroworld> so every week do we have differnt shows on or soething?
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night Maid_RainBow!
<MadSurge> night Maid_RainBow!
<superretroworld> night Maid_RainBow
<tSparx> MadSurge: I mean the insane pace of chat. I'm pretty introverted, so all that talking is very stressful, even in digital form.
<Vivix> Night Maid_RainBow
<tSparx> Night Maid!
<Applejack2012> goodnight
<tSparx> DrSteveSCARz: Crml
<DrSteveSCARz> bye maid_
<tSparx> DrSteveSCARz: Playing a Gurren Lagann game
<MadSurge> tSparx: wait until you see the pace of live episodes...
<Vivix> tSparx, I tend to stay quiet or just shout out "Haha!" or references, or trivia- the chat is way too fast to converse during movies
<Vivix> or well- sometimes everyone focus on one topic, which makes it doable
<Caramel> it's more than just a gurren lagann game...
<Obsidian> superretroworld: Depends on who's streaming, or if there is anyone willing to stream at all
<DrSteveSCARz> it looks pretty cool
<Jmo> Didn't realise it was 4:33AM. Hm.
<superretroworld> oh
<tSparx> Caramel: Oh, well I didn't know that. Explains why there are gundams haha, i thought they were just ganmen that looked like gundams :P
<Caramel> no, they're each from their own shows
<tSparx> MadSurge: Oh Lord. lol
<MadSurge> tSparx: it's all giant robots in a big crisys crossover
<Vivix> There's even a capslock channel
*Vivix plowing through channel list
*Jmo plows Vivix over
<Jmo> ADVENTUUUUUUURE~
<Vivix> !
<MadSurge> Almost 1 quarter of his health gone, and still we can't see its health?
<tSparx> MadSurge: Ah, good good. I've only been here since this fight started, so I didn't realize.
*DrSteveSCARz likes what he sees
<Chrysalis> Saturn please tell me thats not a typo on BUCKs site
<Chrysalis> and its a 3 day event :D
<tSparx> Vivix: I have a good time on movie night, but like I said, it's stressful, or I guess tiring's a better word.
<MadSurge> tSparx: it started with its own characters, but as the franchise grew bigger they managed to insert other famous franchises :D
<Jmo> I like how LaserPon3 is already planning to attend again.
<Obsidian> brb guys
<Caramel> stressfull for you?
<Applejack2012> Laserpon3 again?
<Caramel> we have to MOD the channel during it...
<MadSurge> Nope Caramel :D
<Jmo> Yep Applejack2012.
<Chrysalis> Applejack2012 i hope so
<Vivix> tSparx, yeah, that's about how it feels, fast chat often is
<Chrysalis> hes pretty cool
<tSparx> Caramel: I'm an introvert, all social interaction is tiring. I'm not trying to compare here :/
<Jmo> 'Guaranteed I will be at: Bronycon, EFNW, Equesticon and BUCK'
<MadSurge> So is this goth mecha just a distraction?
<MadSurge> Healing song! :D
*Panda|DrawingPoni licks Yahooz
<tSparx> But chat is so much easier than f2f, because I don't have to worry about what to do with my hands, or to make sure I'm wearing the right expression, etc. So it takes a lot of volume to bring it back up to normal levels of stress, and movie night certainly did that to me.
<Panda|DrawingPoni> whoa! Caramel O____O how are you? havent spoken to you for a while D:
<Caramel> I'm good
<Everlasting_Joy> Holy crap!
<MadSurge> HORI SHITTO
<Panda|DrawingPoni> Caramel ^^ thats good to hear!
<Vivix> tSparx, I'm in therapy for social anxiety, and some of the people I met there with mild social anxiety described it much like you do there, it is very tiring to have it like that
<Vivix> Of course, it's different from person to person
*Jmo pokes Vivix
*Vivix chews on Jmo's finger
<Jmo> ;~;
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony
<MadSurge> Almost dead!
<Vivix> gentle chewing ;__;
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony!
<Applejack2012> the chat goes wild under certain episodes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :D
<tSparx> Vivix: I don't think I rise to social-anxiety levels -- it's not like I'm worried to make a fool of myself or something. I have a ton of friends, and can enjoy parties, and what not
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I eat cookies :3c
*Jmo nomths SuperBrony64
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: what kind of cookies?
<tSparx> Vivix: It's just that social interaction wears me down, and being alone charges me back up :)
<Vivix> tSparx, yeah, it is very different from person to person, and for some it's not a big enough problem to be-- labeled, you know? It's just a personality trait
*SuperBrony64 is nomths D:
<soulrider95> whats a good IRC client?
<Caramel> misses with a 75% hit chance...the RNG really hates me in this game
<Jmo> :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MadSurge: Chocolate chip ^-^
<tSparx> Vivix: :)
*Sketch_Toku_Brony munchs on pizza combos pretzals
<Vivix> For me it makes it difficult to get a job, so I decided it was best--that way
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: YUM
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: that's called being an introvert
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
*Vivix screeches
<Jmo> Pucker up princess o.o
<Vivix> hehe
<tSparx> Vivix: BronyInstrumental that's what I've been saying earlier: I'm an introvert. One of the reasons I like T-Sparx so much is that I can relate to her :)
<BronyInstrumental> i'm an introvert too :)
<Applejack2012> noms pizza too
<Vivix> not sure who that is- but yeah, everyones different
<soulrider95> Does anyone have a good IRC client recommendation for windows?

<Wrek> 05every sick mans dream >.>
*Eli eats chili chips with chocolate ice-cream
<superretroworld> SuperBrony64: how you enjoying the new mario game so far?
<Vivix> I'm using HydraIRC, but being a total noob- it's difficult
<SuperBrony64> 11,02superretroworld: Awesome :3
<tSparx> soulrider95: If you use Firefox, I enjoy Chatzilla. mIRC's good too.
<Marx> This attack better work.
<Everlasting_Joy> It's chicken or turkey noodle soup for me Wrek :), but to each their own.
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: If only it was Wario collecting all those coins :D
<superretroworld> cool
<Vivix> I want it to look the same as webclient, because I use that during stream watching and..stuff, but this one has almost no menus yet
<tSparx> Vivix: You don't know who who is?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MadSurge: Would make an awesome Wario game :P
<Vivix> tSparx, T-Sparx, it's a character ?
<Tovler> I already have 1,000,000 coins. I feel cheated
<tSparx> Vivix: 'Swhat I call Twilight Sparkle :)
<Vivix> Ooh
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: you are a sick sick man?
<Vivix> Nice nickname
<MadSurge> DED
<CrimsonPhoenix> Anyone knows Satan in Steam?
<Vivix> I relate the most to Fluttershy, because it's just about the same level of freakedoutness as I get, ha
<tSparx> T-Sparx = Twilight Sparkle, tSparx = me. I use pPie as a handle when I'm in a P-Pie mood. I never call her P-Pie, but i type her out that way a lot.
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Alchemist> is this a game we are watching?
<cades> yo
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: i seem to have, in my absense contracted man-flu
<tSparx> And T-Sparx + P-Pie = My favs <3
<Kimori> hi
<Vivix> TwiPie, I love that
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: :(, get well soon!
<MadSurge> Vivix: I relate to both 'Shy and Pinkie :D I start out shy and when I get cooking I get as talkative as Pinkie :D
<alexxm> did it just growl
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah, I do that too sometimes, wiht my friends I am hyper and- loud and weird, even in public
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Super Robot Wars
<tSparx> Ew, TwiPie sounds like a ship name. I don't really ship in MLP (or in much, really). But if you like it, I'm happy for you :)
<Applejack2012> I relate to AJ and Rarity
<Vivix> but I break down- easily in social situations without people I know
<Eli> Vivix: i can't relate to any pie shipping... imagining pinkie in something as serious as a relationsship... no way
<Applejack2012> I love applepie
<Alchemist> MadSurge: Oh...And who can read kanji to play it?
<Vivix> I like her show persona, as seen in--baby cakes, I think most fics user her as a joke instead of a character
<tSparx> Alchemist: Crml apparently
<Vivix> so I love shipping her as a char and not a joke
<MadSurge> Alchemist: apparently Caramel can
<Alchemist> Nice! :)
*DrSteveSCARz Defibrillates Chat
<Applejack2012> AJ/Caramel got killed
<Marx> It appears he has Mermaid Man's belt. Why doesn't he use it to shrink the boss?
<soulrider95> Vivix: How do you connect with HydraIRC to this chat?
<BronyInstrumental> i relate mainly to fluttershy mostly, i guess. i keep to myself and have just about never done anything in front of other people i either didn't know or didn't like. and i was too shy to approach Saturn at BUCK so, yeah :D
<Vivix> Uhh, just a sec soulrider95
<Eli> Marx: he tried. he got wambo
<Jmo> BronyInstrumental, you should of sat on Saturns head.
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: awww, he gave me a free ticket so I HAD to thank him personally :D
<Vivix> I can't even consider going to BUCK, I wouldn't be able to go in the door. First day of community college I locked myself into my room and had to call for help
<Malk> tSparx whats going on?
<BronyInstrumental> Jmo: i would'a been too shy too regardless :)
<Tovler> I wish I had a Twilight Sparkle that could help me break out of my ep1-Fluttershy shell.
<BronyInstrumental> MadSurge: he offered me a free ticket but alas, shyness :D
<Jmo> That man needs to be pampered.
<MadSurge> Vivix: let's go there together, I'll drag you through the door :D
<Marx> So it really does have 200,000 HP!
<Vivix> soulrider95, first you create an identity, just your nick and..stuff, and then you press eh new server and use "irc.eu.ponychat.net:6667" adress, and then type /join #bronystate
<tSparx> Malk Not much, just enjoying Crml's stream, talking about introversion and T-Sparx :)
<Alchemist> MadSurge: doesnt sound like a good idea
<Jmo> I'd be too busy sitting on Vivixs head. ;~;
<MadSurge> Finally, its health is visible! :D
<Vivix> It's a bit- confusing, this is only my third time using it
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I got my posters from SuperBrony64 :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why haven't you guys ask him yet?
<Vivix> MadSurge, ooh, yeah. It would be best going with someone who could egg me on. and Jmo is welcome to my head
<Everlasting_Joy> I must depart fillies and gentlecolts.
<MASF123> SuperBrony64
<Malk> Bye
<DrSteveSCARz> byr Everlasting_Joy
<Jmo> SUP.
<MadSurge> Alchemist: exactly, I'll be there to pump you up with courage :D
<Jmo> That's how we roll.
<tSparx> Cya Everlasting_Joy
<Malk> Cya later Everlasting_Joy
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: if you came i would happily help you through, too :)
<MASF123> The Simpsons game...now or later? SuperBrony64
<Jmo> ima go to BUCK on Vivixs head and he'll like it.
<Applejack2012> cya
<Vivix> Aww Yeahh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Yay \:3/
<tSparx> Y'all talkin' 'bout BUCK?
<Vivix> but yeah, if I were to go to buck or similar, I would have to have someone there I'd known for a long time, no first meetings, and such. As my psyche is now at least
<MadSurge> Vivix: apparently I'm brave enough to play the Pinkie if there's other shy people around me :D
<Malk> tSparx Im a pony girl in a brony world:$
<soulrider95> Yeah got the IRC client working!
<MASF123> SuperBrony64...
<tSparx> Malk: Is it done yet?!
<Vivix> MadSurge, aah, I love people like that, I met a guy during community school kinda like that, and he helped me meet people and play music and stuff
<Alchemist> MadSurge: if by courage you mean alcohol or sedatives then okay :)
<tSparx> (excited !?, not angry !?)
<Malk> tSparx still working on it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MASF123: I'm actually going out to eat soon :<
<Malk> tSparx havent worked on it since last time
<Vivix> soulrider95, woo! HydraIRC was a bit confusing for me, but- I like it. Especially the event log, the only thing that bugged me was that ping wasn't default
<tSparx> Malk: Really looking forward to it :)
<Jmo> I'll eat you in a minute SuperBrony64 o.o
<MASF123> ok
<MadSurge> Alchemist: you can have alcohol, I hate the stuff!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02o.O
<Applejack2012> om nom nom
<soulrider95> how do I enable ping D:
<Jmo> Souls are tasty :3
<MASF123> You'll EAT him out? Oh my :(
<Malk> tSparx I really wish I had people helping because its hard to come up with new lines
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<tSparx> I'm usually fine in social situations, and if I know I'm gonna have a hard time, there's always a certain herb that can help me out.
<Vivix> soulrider95, I eh.. I'll query you what I did, it's a bit lengthy ish
<Eli> I'm gonna join next BUCK :) luckily the date fits right between the many birthdays i have to attend in august
<superretroworld> SuperBrony64: what restaurant?
<Applejack2012> Wish I could go to BUCK
<Michael> hai everypony :)
<MadSurge> soulrider95: just type part of a name and then press tab, that way you'll ping people :)
<DrSteveSCARz> hey Michael
<tSparx> Malk: You should feel free to send me what you had, I'd love to look over and help :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<Jmo> I'd attend BUCK but the flight there would be $2k. ;~;
<Malk> tSparx thanks
<Malk> tSparx ill find a way
*Michael hugs DrSteveSCARz Applejack2012
<Applejack2012> hugs back
<Eli> Jmo: it's barely 300for me... where do you live? must be quite far away...
<tSparx> Malk: I can be emailed at G_O_T_R@sbclobal.net, or you can just /msg me the info.
<Alchemist> MadSurge: I drink very rarely too. Maybe about on 1 occasion per month at most. Im just saying that when I drink, I dont become more brave, I become less self conscious. to an outsiedr that means he sees no change in my behaviour, but I get a bit more relaxed :D
<Jmo> Australia maaaate.

<Eli> Alchemist: but then i realised it's freaking stupid
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: For Gryffindor!
<Michael> tSparx: spiral is simply evolution and will
<tSparx> Michael: The anti-spirals were spirals who wanted to stop themselves from accidentally growing too big and destroying the universe, so they stopped their own growth and became anti-spirals.
<Vivix> Soulrider95. test
<tSparx> Michael: Oh I thought you were asking what anti-spirals were, my bad haha
<Michael> tSparx: i know, i watched the series like 20 times
<Vivix> and the classic soulrider95: test

<tSparx> Well, I mean, that insanity is funny, but she's not enjoying it.
<Vivix> I like it, in that episode, but not so much in fics yet, most tend to overplay it
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Applejack2012> Me too
<tSparx> TheKatPony: I hated to see P-Pie sad, but the scenes where she threw a party with the inanimate objects is one of the funniest scenes in the whole series xD

<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: hitting up in the type section would of been easier
<Meanwhile> Probably for the best.
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know, I seriously think EileMonty has proven herself better than rina-Chan enough
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mML2fPec7xU waiting music :)
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: I do not know that
*Spectrum_Rush looks up
<Spectrum_Rush> ya cant see, bt ya see
<Chrysalis> i dont get why your dealing with "better than"
<Chrysalis> they are both fantastic voices
<Chrysalis> and doing it for free
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: you're*
<otakon> hiya Chrysalis
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, Rina-Chan has no voice range
<Michael> ohai Chrysalis
<CrimsonPhoenix> EileMonty has done plenty of voice accurately
<Chrysalis> CrimsonPhoenix far more than you could ever muster
<twilight_sprinkle> Michael: that would be good for intermission music
<Spademagnes[R]> Might as well crank on some Sonic Generations music or some Kingdom Hearts music
<Michael> twilight_sprinkle: IKR
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yet we hear Rina-Chan EVERYWHERE and EileMonty nowhere except that video AtC did
<Applejack2012> needs some intermission music
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: I can't paint but I know that recent restoration of christ was hilariously bad.
<TheKatPony> ^^
<Michael> Applejack2012: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxbSRpVJ3s&feature=watch_response
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis, I am sorry but I am convince with this opinion and you cannot change my mind
<Spademagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_sgxY4SUA&feature=relmfu
<Chrysalis> everyone is entitled to an opinion
<Chrysalis> but its a dick move if you insult someone for what they are doing for free

<VioletLynnScraton> Applejack2012: I'm pretty sure SpikexRarity is R34.

<Vivix> Same
<Michael> true
<VioletLynnScraton> AJIsAwesome: Meh... true.
<thelonepony> true
<Vivix> I'm not a Spike fan, but there's tons of non R34 spike ships out there

<thelonepony> get the muffins!
<twilight_sprinkle> Happy annual celebration of a certain number of days since your creation, Derpy_Hooves!
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Happy Birthday!
<DJ-Gigabit> Yes, happy birthday Derpy_Hooves!
<DJ-Gigabit> Hope you're tuned in!
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, Cool! I was at the town hall here a few days ago, and they had a Pinkie Pie in the windowsill
*Michael drops a truck full of muffins over derpy
<lowfn> Happy birthday Derpy_Hooves ! I hope your day is filled with muffins and bubbles!
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: That's great!
<pPie> AJIsAwesome: So my dormitory is currently Olympic-themed, and my floor is specifically volleyball themed.
<Metronome> Dont click this, but song link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHWwKC8WjU
<Vivix> It's fun to find ponies. The painting was like a wall murial?
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Derpy_Hooves is actually afk and will miss all these messages.
<pPie> AJIsAwesome: There's a sign on the hall that just says, "SPIKE!"
<Derpy_Hooves> ./).(\
<Vivix> !

<pPie> AJIsAwesome: And I need a picture of Spike (or of Twilight yelling (for spike or not)) to put under there xD
*otakon lies at the bottom of a gorge still "adventure...!"
<AJIsAwesome> DJ-Gigabit: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY APPLAUSE!
<Dovah> DJ-Gigabit: that song has been copyrighted you dont have the right to sing it :P
<Vivix> In the basement of the dorm I was in we had grafitti eveyrwhere, and everyone would sit in the corner and play ping pong and mariokart
<Vivix> if I had been there THIS year, I woulda painted mlp reference somewhere
<otakon> finally!
<otakon> it had goddamn copyrights on it before
<Metronome> HB-Day http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/088/9/7/happy_birthday_derpy_by_whitediamondsltd-d4uad8s.jpg Random art
<otakon> dat Derpy
<thelonepony> so CUTE!!
<AJIsAwesome> Metronome: That's an awesome picture..
<pPie> Musical works don't enter public domain until 100 years after their coypright-owner's death.
<Vivix> I thought it was 75
<pPie> Same as most things. (Some things enter public domain earlier, having trouble coming up with an example.) In the US of course.
<Vivix> but if someone renews the copyright BEFORE expiration, it gets another lifetime + 75
<pPie> Vivix: I mispoke.
<Vivix> Oh okay, I'm not too sure what the actual year was, so was just asking
<pPie> It's 100 years after the original publication, or someodd (I guess 75) after the author's death
<Vivix> Aah
<pPie> Whichever comes first. Usually the former, obviously, but.
<VioletLynnScraton> Gah, gotta use the lavaritory.... be right back.
<AJIsAwesome> VioletLynnScraton: You know, IN THE BATHROOM!
<Alchemist> good night yall!
<Vivix> Goodnight Alchemist!

<DJ-Gigabit> I'm a staff member, but not a mod. I can use colour if I want, but usually don't.
<otakon> ....
<otakon> well taht was odd
<DJ-Gigabit> AJIsAwesome: Mika - Stuck In The Middle

<tSparx> Ok. So must all mods use colour, then? Or is it optional for both mods and staffmembers? Cause I like being able to tell who's a mod and who's not that easily, 'cause my client doesn't show user-modes next to handles
<NocturnalBlade> hi emerald
<Vivix> Most mods use colour, I think Caramel is the only one who don't?
<tSparx> Hello Emerald
<Vivix> Wrek got his back
<Meanwhile> There's nothing saying mods /must/ use colour, they just tend to for sake of ease.

<Dumorimasoddaa> It can acess files on a disk and that's about it
<AJIsAwesome> emerald: I have. It's just to be a joke, though.

<Dumorimasoddaa> Part of me wonders if I could code a HTML 5 relay of the stream
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah knida sound like that more
<emerald> no ive been here for a while aj
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's likely doable one-to-one but multistreaming would need more bandwidth than I could afford
<luna_pony> yes emerald is kinda new he's my big bro
<applejack096> Thats ok DJ-Gigabit :) So who here lives in England??
<tSparx> Sup Polydunami !

<CrimsonPhoenix> French music~
<luna_pony> um if you want to that is:(
<Polydunami> Good night applejack096
<AJIsAwesome> applejack096: Bye!

<tSparx|Reading> luna_pony: Plz avoid linking to non-image pages during streams without asking a mod first
<luna_pony> sorry
<CrimsonPhoenix> luna_pony, that is advertisement and it is not allowed
<tSparx|Reading> Later applejack096

<tSparx|Reading> luna_pony: No one be mad
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as a non-image link during stream which is also not allowed
<luna_pony> :'( sorry i didnt know
<tSparx|Reading> luna_pony: ... yet :P
<thelonepony> night applejack096
<CrimsonPhoenix> Read Da Rulez
<tSparx|Reading> CrimsonPhoenix: Be nice :P
<thelonepony> ^
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's mostly vid links that invoke the ire of the mods
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was joking at the end
<Meanwhile> Read the rules or receive a boot to the face.
<Polydunami> *head :P
<Meanwhile> No I definitely meant face.
<luna_pony> hi thelonepony
<Polydunami> Right. Boot to the head was in my will, never mind :P
<thelonepony> hai luna_pony :)
<Marx> Ok, so I got Keldeo just now, and I'll tell you this because you would never guess it otherwise: To get Keldeo to learn Secret Sword, you have to go to the Moor of Iccirus.
<Applejack2012> goodnight
<emerald> i<3rainbow dash
<luna_pony> how are you today
<emerald> :D
<Meanwhile> Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6.
<Applejack2012> love Dash too
<tSparx|Reading> I love all of them, oh so much.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :S
<AJIsAwesome> Let's not hate any of the Mane 6. If anything, you can dislike them but not hate.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I must say Rarity has outdone herself http://fav.me/d5cmoat
<AJIsAwesome> Hate can be a very strong word.
<Meanwhile> I hate Rainbow Dash.
<emerald> :S ;)
<Eulshy> Besides, Sweetie Belle is beast pony anyway
<Applejack2012> You're going to love me!
<Dken2021> Marx you sure we're talking about pokemon here?
<tSparx|Reading> Alright, so I don't use the in-site client, and I just realized that's what this is: that :S smiley becomes a pony-emoticon, yes?
<lowfn> Rainbow Dash is still better than Rarity :| But Twilight is best pony.
<Applejack2012> Pokemon is best pokemon
<Meanwhile> Rainbow Dash just annoys me. She's a douche.
<luna_pony> &)
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<Polydunami> Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six, to be honest :$
<Applejack2012> But Rarity and Sweetie Belle is best
<emerald> rainbow dash is best pony and love and tolerate
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix dear celestia, more sweet pics :D
*lowfn anti-brohoofs Polydunami
<Michael> Meanwhile: lol
<Vivix> Rarishypie are my three favourites
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: She's just brash and oblivious to the ponies' feelings, that's all.
<Polydunami> ._.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just post what I can find
<Meanwhile> That's what I said
<AJIsAwesome> SOmetimes.
<Meanwhile> She's a douche
<Dovah> Discord Is best Pony
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<Michael> there's no best pony, nuff said
<tSparx|Reading> Everyone has their own opinion on the ponies.
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<otakon> ...
<Dovah> Q is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Douche is being a dick, she's just a jerk sometimes.
<luna_pony> discord is a dragonaquis not a pony but still he is cool
<Applejack2012> Discord best draconques
<Marx> It's pretty wierd you have to visit the Moor of Icirrus for Secret Sword, considering there's no apparent history of the area... Ohhhh, now they explain it.
<Meanwhile> Same thing.
<tSparx|Reading> I never say, "[Blank] is the [blankest] pony." 'Cause why bother?
<Polydunami> Sorry lowfn, but the character of Rarity grew on me over time :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> This song~
<Dovah> luna_pony: he is part pony
<otakon> lol
<otakon> this song is lol
<Polydunami> But she's not my absolute favourite.
<Meanwhile> Now Pinkie Pie, that's a best pony.
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Not really. JUst because words are similar doesn't mean they're are the same.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Solaire is best in Jolly Co-op lol Dark Souls reference
<lowfn> Twilight sparkle is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid grammar error.:|
<luna_pony> yeah and part goat but thats not saying he's nibbling washing on the line
<emerald> piccard pony is best pony
<Meanwhile> In this instance it does. Because we're speaking in a metaphorical sense.
<emerald> :3
<Dumorimasoddaa> We all know Dumorimasoddaa is best poni
<Dovah> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Dark Souls :|
<CrimsonPhoenix> People who oves Rarity knows what's up
<Dumorimasoddaa> So stop the bickering
<tSparx|Reading> It also helps that I love all the Mane6, so my least-favorite is still beloved :
<Meanwhile> If we were speaking literally I probably wouldn't compare Rainbow Dash to something used to clean a vagina.
<Dken2021> ...interesting song
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<VioletLynnScraton> Scootaloo FTW
<CrimsonPhoenix> Her complexity, charisma and motivation is beyond interesting
<Michael> wtf steam
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dovah yep :) gotta get my ps3 fixed to play it again though :(
<emerald> scootaloo is best children
<Dovah> Sketch_Toku_Brony: pc version.. i wants it
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<Meanwhile> Scootaloo is best chicken.
<Michael> ^
<Marx> Secret Sword aquired!
<emerald> chicken i mean
<luna_pony> chicken you mean emerald
<CrimsonPhoenix> To be honest, I do despise the chicken joke on Scootaloo
<tSparx|Reading> I am the best pony, motherfuckers.
<tSparx|Reading> :P
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<Applejack2012> Pinkie Pie is best chicken
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Same here. It's been beaten to death.
<Spademagnes[R]> <.<
<Meanwhile> Objection, Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<emerald> sweetie belle is best robot
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<Dken2021> I belive the best pony is john de lancie, he said so himself
<luna_pony> well i'm leaving this page Goodbye
<tSparx|Reading> Eulshy: We heard you the first time, haha
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dovah yeah it looks pretty good on pc,hopefully the dlc will release in oct or so
<Spademagnes[R]> The chicken jokes have gone a bit.... foul
<Michael> there's no best pony...
<AJIsAwesome> luna_pony: Bye.

<Eulshy> tSparx|Reading, not everypony has accepted Sweetie Belle as best pony
<Vivix> Sweetie belle is my personal CMC favourite
<luna_pony> all ponies are best ponies
<emerald> i see what you did there
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<mikebond3401>
<tSparx|IgnoringThisS> Oh well okay I can't have a nick that long.
<Spectrum_Rush> wasnt that supposed to be crackles cousin
<Dovah> Sketch_Toku_Brony: for console!?
<Meanwhile> Trixie is worst pony.
<emerald> yup
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, right I forgot about that
<mikebond3401> Can i talk wit my mic?
*Vivix is a Trixie fan
<mikebond3401> ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> well that song escalated quickly

<mikebond3401> :|
<Michael> leave trixie alone Meanwhile :(
<Applejack2012> I love Trixie too

<mikebond3401> >_>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dovah idk if itll get to console but i hope cuz it looks amazing,the content is included w/ the pc ver
<emerald> diamond tiara is bitch
*Meanwhile runs Trixie over with a steamroller.
<Meanwhile> Toot toot.
<AJIsAwesome> This will solve everyone's problems. http://cheezburger.com/6497577472
<Vivix> I adore her, but in Real life I'd be so constantly annoyed at her
<Marx> Now, here's the thing: Keldeo's a Water type (along with Fighting), and the Pokedex says he can glide across water and stuff. Not to mention, Keldeo looks like a pony, so does that make him, dare I say it, a Seapony?!
<thelonepony> i love trixie
<mikebond3401> My little ponymon?
<Vivix> I adore Diamond and Silver too- so I'm ... odd? I dunno
<mikebond3401> Friendship is kanto?
<Michael> AJIsAwesome: agreed
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it sounds like a depressed guy that just lost a relationship
<Dovah> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I know omg I want it so much! :)
<mikebond3401> Friendship is kanto?
<AJIsAwesome> Keldeo: Pokemon's equivalent to seaponies.
<mikebond3401> My little ponymon?
<Spademagnes[R]> Why the hell would anyone like Diamond Tiara
<mikebond3401> XD
<tSparx|Reading> All we're gonna do talking about best and worst ponies is hurt feelings. No one's gonna be swayed to love your fav pony. Our opinions'll be set, at least until there's new char. development in ssn. 3
<Michael> mikebond3401: dat game
<Applejack2012> I like DT too
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: well they are children, so i cant really hate them
<mikebond3401> ?
<Vivix> tSparx|Reading, true
<Meanwhile> I want to throw Diamond Tiara in a well.
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx|Reading: Agreed.
<mikebond3401> pm Michael
<mikebond3401> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: People can like her in terms of being a rival.
*Vivix hugs AJIsAwesome and tSparx|Reading
<twilight_sprinkle> *cough*fluttershyisworstpony*cough*
<mikebond3401> :/
<tSparx|Reading> At which point I'd find these convos a little less silly.

<Polydunami> Hmm? :|

<Applejack2012> you will love me
<mikebond3401> That's a funny way to spell everypony...
<Vivix> I did enjoy RD more because of her char dev, so I like that there is char dev
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy is second worst mane 6.

<otakon> Meanwhile: stopt that
<mikebond3401> Friendship
<Meanwhile> otakon: No.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity...is ready! http://i.imgur.com/jtD4Y.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> Trixie is 3rd best pony, Rarity is 2nd
<Kandarihu> Fluttershy is my second favorite Mane 6
<twilight_sprinkle> after that all ponies are best except fluttershy
<Dovah> and now i have food wut did i miss?
<Meanwhile> Trixie's just a jerk.

<Marx> On another thing, I don't know how both of the Keldeo I got ended up with the exact same nature, one that lowers Sp. Atk.
<mikebond3401> :)
<sub06905> ohai everypony :)
<Dovah> Vivix: trixie's special talent is being a jerk, she cant help it
<tSparx|Reading> Dovah: I love all the Mane6. Not equally, but I do. Rarity's my least fav, and I'd still love to bro with her.
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi sub06905

<Barbetos> Kinky
<Lunac> The infamus snape hed shve

<Reikim> I used to be the dodgeball KING
<Barbetos> Bronysith ITS TURNING!!
<Reikim> Or not
*cachi01|mobile can dodge chuck norris kick
<LunaTheBeloved> Bronysith, NO...It might trigger a Mustach Attack!!
<BronyInstrumental> it annoys me that everyone can say "during highschool" when i still have a few years to go :(
<thelonepony> i want someone to attack me :(
<Meanwhile> If you're playing dodgeball expect to take a ball to the face.
<otakon> Shizuka: I kept trying to tell them to split up and make smaller targets but NO! don't listen to the chubby kid
<Reikim> Actually I dropped gym after the first year, because it was stupid and getting in the way of fun stuff like math.
*Barbetos "USE THIS!" gives Bronysith a shotgun
<Lunac> sleeves then shove
<otakon> best Snape scene
<Dken2021> ooh, a rifftrax of goblet of fire
<Meanwhile> I played the dodge role, on account of being a lot more nimble back then.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: You also present a much smaller target.
<Meanwhile> Exacta.
<otakon> Meanwhile: back then? Your a goddamn sprite now
<Meanwhile> You're*
<Dken2021> Reikim you don't move much do-- then again, gym's is pretty useless
<WalkerPony89> GAH! Buffer!
<otakon> Meanwhile: you must have been a wisp back then, if you turned sideways you'd be nearly invisible
<Lunac> I hate teenage rmances in films, they butcher it so much
<AJIsAwesome> I was more dodge and catch, considering the fact I wasn't really that good with throwing.
<Reikim> Man. Gym sucks. But Math? Best class ever.
<Barbetos> Oh thank god! Harry is NOT gay! I was worried. This scene reconciled my worries.
<BronyInstrumental> Reikim: lucky. i have to do it for 2 more years, and have had to for 3
<Dken2021> hells yea Reikim /)

<Barbetos> Most relationships end at "You like ponies?" for me
<Lunac> Lying there depressing hlding an egg= perfect metaphr for teenage sex
<Barbetos> I just get it on the table right away.
<Reikim> Math is great. It's easy. It's rote. It's the only- well, one of the few classes I can sleep through (legitimately, sleep through) and still come out with nigh-perfect scores
<Meanwhile> Reikim: I hate math. Then I threw my mates pencil case out a window, and it got better.
<otakon> lol
<Shizuka> 13i thought the patils were in ravenclaw
<otakon> WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO THE DANCE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

<otakon> THE BURST INTO FLAME AND INTO A PILE OF ASH!
<Barbetos> So. If some one made a polyjuice potion of you, what do you think it would taste like? Mine would probably be whiskey and smooth cigars.

<BronyInstrumental> Dken2021: that homework was pointless and didn't make us any smarter
<otakon> that's better

*Meanwhile on the back of a Megadeth album...

<Dken2021> reeally, neville got lucky?
<otakon> that's how he gained that level of badass
<thelonepony> ^

<Fez_Quick_Thinker> me
<JESmith71> Inb4 MLD is overrated people
<otakon> TRIVIA!
<Meanwhile> MLD /is/ overrated.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Everyone has their own opinions.
<Shizuka> 13mm gravity resistant trees
<JESmith71> Seems to always come up when that fic is brought up
<dynamo2814> nothing like that ussually makes me cry like movies or what not but that actually made me cried
<BronyInstrumental> what is the point of gravity resistant trees?
<otakon> JESmith71: it's not as weepy as I would thought really. Now, the Married Life scene from Up on the other hand...:'(
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: Funny that Harry should say "No offense but I really don't care" because it's exactly what I was about to say to you.
<Shizuka> 13MLD is meh
<Lunac> tartan scarf neville? really?
<sagas> why mention oscar wilde?

<otakon> Toy Story 3
<XylemTube> I see vampires
<otakon> so goddamn good
<otakon> and there goes Filch permaturely again
<CrimsonPhoenix> JESmith71, and yea MLD is overrated
<sagas> KFC Double Down!
<Reikim|Streamless> Shizuka: Wow, the ladies' room must have really nice graffiti. In the men's side it's mostly really bad representations of phallic objects mixed with crude vernacular and the occasional...more extensive drawing.
<otakon> MLD is okay
<otakon> FINALLY!
<otakon> THE ONE TO KILL HIM!
<dynamo2814> my video is behind about a minute if ur already at the cannon fire
<Dken2021> Neville, you're a murderer
<Shizuka> 13Reikim|Streamless: not really, mostly it's fanfics of twilight
<WindWhistler> You're a murderer Neville
<otakon> dynamo2814: we're at Harry swimming down
<otakon> lol
<Reikim|Streamless> Shizuka: Oh. Oh. In that case, I'll stick to the men's side...

<Reikim|Streamless> Yeah...
<Shizuka> 13PREVIOUSLY ON FISHING WEEK
<JESmith71> Shizuka:When you say fanfic of Twilight do you mean the vampires or the pony?
<otakon> dynamo2814: clear your cache, refresh the stream and check your internet speed.
<Zamer> so who's streaming tonight?
<AJIsAwesome> Zamer: Shizuka.
<otakon> You're a seabass Harry.
<Meanwhile> Is there really still another hour to go?
<dynamo2814> well i can tell you right now my internet speed is crap
<otakon> Meanwhile: eeyup
<sagas> damn commy spy
<Lunac> Yay Emma Watson was drowning for a short while! YAY!
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Yup.:D
<dynamo2814> because my computer is crap
<Meanwhile> Mmmm...no can probably still make it.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT BAD TOUCH
<JESmith71> Honestly though I like Crioton's stuff much better that MLD myself
<Dken2021> they're practically naked
<otakon> dan their creepy
<WindWhistler> Just out of curiosity, are they riffing as their MST3K characters or no?
<sagas> you know what they say about big feet....
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not one to read fanfics.
<otakon> JAWS!
<Dken2021> sharks in a lake?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLD is overrated cause it's considered the most popular fanfic when it doesn't reach to quality to deserve that popularity
<Shizuka> 13clearly kevin forgot he had that goblet of fire from cabot
<otakon> WindWhistler: enope
<CrimsonPhoenix> THAT is why it is overrated
<otakon> WindWhistler: just riffing
<Lunac> yay a student is shark bait
<sagas> dem drugs
<CrimsonPhoenix> it might be decent, it might have made people cry but it is also overrated
<WindWhistler> By the way...who riffs with Joel on Cinimatic Titanic?
<Eulshy> LSD is a hell of a drug
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: have you tried Fallout Equestria?
<Meanwhile> Stamping on feet can make people cry.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: That's what I say about most fanfics. Especially Cupcakes.
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, WAY too long for me
<JESmith71> WindWhistler: Everyone else from MST3k who isn't on Rifftrax
<Eulshy> CrimsonPhoenix, I never read it anyway
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: you should though, it's legitimately good
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, Cupcakes isn't overrated it's complete utter shit
<otakon> GRINDYLOWS!
<BronyInstrumental> CrimsonPhoenix: ikr? TL;DR?
<Dken2021> wasn't there a even more ridiculous long fic longer than FO;E?
<otakon> Dken2021: enope
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, also I never was a fane of Fallout
<otakon> it's the longest fanfiction currently
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: oh well then it might not be for you then
<sagas> time to eat some calamari
<sub06905> i hate sad things, mainly because i cry to eaisly to sad things
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, that's what I thought
<JESmith71> otakon: How long is Fallout? Never looked at it
<AJIsAwesome> I never was into Fallout to begin with, so I probably wouldn't like it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> May I mention a fanfic that does deserve some praise?
<Dken2021> free harry!
<LadyCanary> LOL Dken2021
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Sure.
<otakon> JESmith71: it's 39 chapter, it's 2000+ pages(8x11, 12 point font) at over 65K words.
<otakon> well yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> You guys know this picture right here? http://fav.me/d4r821l
<otakon> did my chat die again?
<Flootahshy> Heya Bronystate.
<AJIsAwesome> Flootahshy: Hello!
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm saving that one
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Flootahshy
<otakon> hiya Flootahshy
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: No. Just slow.
<cades> haha
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix I've seen sketches of those way back
<CrimsonPhoenix> well there's a fanfic based on that http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22925/Tales-from-Mystika%3A-A-My-Little-Mages-Book
<Eulshy> Post all the fan fics?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's unpopular due to I believe human being the cause
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's very well-written and well-pace
<CrimsonPhoenix> I also love the action and the suspense in it
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix don't matter with me, thanks for linking it
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as the dark atmosphere it gives
<otakon1> bugger all
<Eulshy> post all the fan fics?
<JESmith71> I don't read much fanfic myself, but I do like Crioton's stuff like Sunset and For Want of a Dawn (Is there anyone here who's heard of him)? His stuff may have flaws, but I like his writing style. Like he does some good grimdark stories, but they end on good notes
<otakon1> stupid USB adapter keeps going out
<NullRadix> JESmith71: I followed both of those
<otakon1> JESmith71: Sunset, isn't that the one with Twi and a secret she discovers?
<JESmith71> otakon: Yep
<Meanwhile> Ooray.
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> WERE A COUPLE OF MISFITS WE'RE A COUPLE OF MISFITS
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Reikim|Streamless> My favourite fanfic - my absolute favourite - has to go out to The White Room.
<Reikim|Streamless> Nuff said.
<NullRadix> The White Room?
<Flootahshy> Reikim|Streamless: What's it about?
<BronyInstrumental> by definition i'm a misfit :(
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim|Streamless: What genre?
<otakon1> damn
<Eulshy> ima fismit
<Flootahshy> A black house?
<Reikim|Streamless> Um
<otakon1> BronyInstrumental: technically everyone is a misfit
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> my fav (even thought i've read a few) has to be the one that has general patton in Equestria
<dynamo2814> are there streams like this everyday
<otakon1> a wee bit sharp
<Reikim|Streamless> To be honest, I'd be hard-pressed to actually describe The White Room and actually do it justice...it's one of those things you have to read, really.
<otakon1> dynamo2814: not all the time, it's random
<Dovah> my eyes hurt. I just read all rules of the internet...
<dynamo2814> hmm ok
<otakon1> Dovah: you poor poor bastard
<Dken2021> dynamo2814 it varies betweeen other streamer
<BronyInstrumental> otakon1: technically, everyone IS but most people try not to be. and why don't you ghost your name?
<Dovah> otakon: yay?
<otakon1> BronyInstrumental: bc I'm tired of doing it every goddamn 10 minutes bc Netgear makes shitty USB Wifi adapters that bork out randomly for no damn reason
<thelonepony> Dovah what rule did it scare you the most?
<JESmith71> And he doesn't just do dark stuff like those two, he did a fun one where Celestia and Luna have a prank war, a few stories about Twilight and Trixie being sisters, one where Derpy takes in Dinky after she loses her birth parents, etc
<otakon1> I'll just wait until it ghosts automatically
<otakon1> also, going to Hogwarts I would touch NOTHING EVER
<Dken2021> you're dead harry
<Dovah> thelonepony: possibly 899
<otakon1> seriously NEVER TOUCH ANYTHING IN HOGWARTS
<Meanwhile> If I went to Hogwarts I'd touch /everything/
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i would as well
<otakon1> Meanwhile: and you'd be a dead moustache
<Reikim|Streamless> Okay, sorry, the fanfic I was talking about was White Box. And it's........
<Meanwhile> Think of the fun things you could find.
<Reikim|Streamless> I still can't properly describe it.
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> you may find the potion that turns you into a pony :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon1, we're a couple of misfits
<Dken2021> aww, I can't touch the stone of pain and suffering?
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> HEY THATS MY LINE :[
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh Fez_Quick_Thinker got it way quicker than I
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<Flootahshy> Reikim|Streamless: It's called "The White Room"?
<otakon1> CrimsonPhoenix: we're a couple of misfits, what's wrong with misfits? Why don't we fit in!
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim|Streamless: Well, can you tell what genre it is? I.E. Grimdark, Sad, Normal. etc.
<otakon1> Reikim|Streamless: what's wrong man?
<Reikim|Streamless> Flootahshy: Nope, it's called White Box.
<CrimsonPhoenix> still one of the greatest classics
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> pottery sucks

<otakon1> LOL!
<Reikim|Streamless> I will link White Box, because I think it is a good read. You can choose to read it or not to, and whether you do is your choice entirely. I cannot give an indication of what it is like, because it speaks for itself. It is a work beyond description, not without reducing what it is...Enjoy, if it please you. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXZO8KZBziEIEXVW_h5VZtwn41M3yE0_9MX4g9Fjeac/edit?pli=1

<Reikim> otakon: Nuh, you're going to play Alien Swarm.
<otakon> nope
<otakon> I don't like it
<Eulshy> otakon, i wanna play MvM
<Reikim> Why not, otakon? It's fun with friends.
<otakon> plus for some reason it runs slow on my PC
<Vordox> Not to mention the games looks fun. <3
<Polydunami|DW> I'll be back in a minute
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo I think someone misplaced a joke in translation
<otakon> Reikim: it doesn't run at a good speed even of the lowest settings for some reason
<BronyInstrumental> otakon: wanna add me on steam regardless? sometimes i feel up for playing at slightly less rediculous times
<WindWhistler> FLUTTERSHY SHOULD NOT SCREAM
<Reikim> otakon, you have to have friends and fix that. Hold on.
<otakon> sure BronyInstrumental
<otakon> what's yer tag?
<BronyInstrumental> otakon take a wild guess
<otakon> um
<otakon> Octavias_Plot
<otakon> :P
<BronyInstrumental> otakon close enough
<Reikim> otakon: Try running it windowed. If that doesn't help, open Task Manager. Something else is eating up your processor time. (that or your PC just sucks even worse than my laptop)
<thelonepony> did stream derp?
<Champion_of_Harmony> Soooo no more stream?
<Dken2021> no stream for mow
<Dken2021> *now

<flutter_spin> LOL Scoot
<Reikim> DrSteveSCARz: Option in options, under video.
<Champion_of_Harmony> okay then I shall take my leave and head to toonami aftermath.

<otakon> Reikim: I don't know
<DrSteveSCARz> Reikim: Thanks TF2 is really slow for me also
<Shizuka> 13so set launch options, -window -noborder
<otakon> well it slowed down ALOT during the elvator on the practice level
<Reikim> Shizuka, I don't think he knows how to do that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon i can run fine tf2 but can't run alien swar without it being slow as hell :p
<otakon> I mean single digit frames
<Champion_of_Harmony> scratch that...
<Reikim> otakon: That's normal, it's the baddies spawning. Even I get that.
<otakon> I do dammit
<BronyInstrumental> i can only play TF2 on thursdays, saturdays and some sundays but nopony ever wants to play on those days and i get ronery :(

<Eulshy> I should be working on my story
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mine sucks with alien swarm for some reason
<Reikim> Eulshy: Protip, stay away from Bstate. Really bad for productivity

<LadyCanary> YAY! An SB64 stream!
<Eulshy> Reikim, I once pissed off a mod on a chat by saying Protip: Nobody cares for your protips, everyone on the chat found it funny

<Polydunami|DW> Oh, I was going to post the part where Fluttershy cheered at the sonic rainboom ._.
<spitfirecolt2> otakon i am enforcer1252 on steam
<otakon> BronyInstrumental: sure
<Dovah> SuperBrony64: just a hunch
<Reikim> Eulshy: Protip: Clearly you haven't figured out the subtle art of irony yet.
<otakon> spitfirecolt2: just add me, it's easier to remember. otakon17

<Spademagnes[R]> So what shall we watch today?
<Malk> otakon Is the great and powerful trixie playing with us?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No, I'd like to know your evidence to support your claim. That's a pretty negative thing to say about someone you barely know.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Derpy_Hooves creepy one
<Dken2021> Derpy_Hooves eh, it's not that bad, seems kinda realistic
<otakon> Malk: I think so
<Spademagnes[R]> Also I hate it when my computer auto shuts down when it gets too hot
<Reikim> After all, with a Shizu on our side, we really can't meet a challenge without Advanced.
<Shizuka> 13except decoy
<Shizuka> 13giant pyros on wave 1
<Shizuka> 13so much pain
<BronyInstrumental> it's 4AM. Why am not tired?
<Derpy_Hooves> Dken2021: keep it on your screen and watch the faces
<flutter_spin> Can't stop watching Fluttershy yay in other languages
<otakon> Shizuka: you meeting us in the room?
*Dovah isnt paying attention to chat.
<Eulshy> You kow whatm I would love to see someone streaming theirselves playing Paper Mario and the thousand Year door
<Reikim> Clearly this is a thing we must do.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dovah: I'm waiting for your answer.
<Polydunami|DW> Derpy_Hooves, when they look at you, push Esc >:3
<Dken2021> I think your computer is telling you that "DEAR GOD, STOP RUNNING SO MANY THINGS ON ME ALL AT ONCE! I'M BURNING HERE!!"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> any map is fine for me
<Reikim> Decoy, Advanced. We will find the optimal combo.
<Dovah> SuperBrony64: didnt hear the ping therefor you said nothing :P
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<spitfirecolt2> otakon invite sent

<flutter_spin> Oh if it was Nit, you would be in for it. Not sure about SB.
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Not cool, dude. Mental issues aren't something to joke about.:|
<spitfirecolt2> sb has no mental problems sb64 is cool and awesome
<Dovah> I said I THOUGHT you had mental issues there is a difference there is only so much i can tell about a person from what they type
<LadyCanary> Indeed.

<Reikim> Do not do that
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome: I am an uncareing person, sorry *shrugs*

<HoodyNinja> Dken2021: Wait wha?
<Zamer> I misplaced my game copy somewhere need to find it
<CrimsonPhoenix> the music is nice but too pop for me to cons- aw who am I kidding those tunes are catchy

<Zamer> i was mad a little bit because of the countdown timer
<Zamer> and my own urges of wanting a sequal
<Dken2021> Unnr ya, heard about that, and since this is squeenix, it'll be another expensive app
<Zamer> but got over it
<cachi01|mobile> Pokemon song :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_411G29lfy4&feature=youtube_gdata_player
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, wait what?

<Unnr> Zamer: its still sad though
<CrimsonPhoenix> Twewy doesn't need a sequel
<Zamer> $20 for it and the Phone/Pad is seperate games
<flutter_spin> No! No Eulshy. You don't just pop in here with a story and leave!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man square enix is really goin downhill
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's good enough as a standalone
<flutter_spin> Dat "Pokemon Crystal Battle Music"
<cachi01|mobile> Oh yeah... That Twewy mix edition
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|mobile: Never found Lavender Town creepy.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<cachi01|mobile> Its meh
<cachi01|mobile> Hold on
<Zamer> well Crimson all the pieces were there, the creator hinting serveraly at wanting to do one, then we get TWEWY cast in KH:3DS

<Zamer> then we were given a 7day countdown timer which turned out to be just for the ports
<flutter_spin> lol. Dat tower.
<cachi01|mobile> I like hypnos lullaby
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah i did like that the twewy cast was included to at least acknowledge them
<Zamer> PinkiePry i always enjoyed Lavender Town's music as well
<PinkiePry> It's just so calming. xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK0xyRL1A-k

<Spademagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSiur8XNeiU&feature=BFa&list=PLC3AC72FED412E3B7
<Unnr> Dark92Enigma: The Loony Tunes Show had The Wizard
<Unnr> All arguements are invalid
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I actually kind of like it.
<Dark92Enigma> i meant The New Show
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: do you mean a spinoff or the classic?
<shibaru> It stands for
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: the sitcom spinoff
<shibaru> Penis Man
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: It's a good sitcom based off the old Looney Tunes.
<Unnr> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oe7Q8OCm5I
<Unnr> Behold
<Unnr> its glorious
<superretroworld> oh, ive only seen alittle bit of it, and jokes were not funny
<Buytoast> The Looney Tunes Show is a steaming pile of shit
<Dken2021> THE Looney Toons Show? eh, different, but wouldn't call it garbage, just the jokes are pretty mature for a kids show
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I just watched an ep. That one with Daffy Bowling
<AJIsAwesome> Even if its not as "slap-sticky" as the old one.
*Spademagnes[R] throws a Mine Turtle into the chat
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: I FREAKING LOVE THAT ONE.:D
*Petrified_Discord steps on Mine Turtle
<Rex_Mundi> The new one with lola? I rather like that show.
<Zamer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bebSxF0rr5I who remembers this

<Spademagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDoS25kP2OQ&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397&index=19&feature=plpp_video

<Rex_Mundi> Yes... something
<Dken2021> Unnr dear god, that intro animation
<cades> XD
<thelonepony> well somepony get the mop Petrified_Discored isn't gonna clean himself
<Zamer> I have came to the conclusion The Loony Toons Show is an alternate universe to where the Loony Toons lost to the Mon-Stars in Space Jam and this was the result after major brainwashing
<HoodyNinja> Zamer: OMG YES!
*Petrified_Discord cleans himself
<Barbetos> =o
<Petrified_Discord> What now, thelonepony :P
<cachi01|mobile> Zamer im watching it right now
<cachi01|mobile> Its hilarious
<thelonepony> ponies?
<Petrified_Discord> Yes.
<cades> do me a favor and NEVER get facebook
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: maybe i'm being too harsh with that show......but some episodes were dissapointing IMO.....the one i sorta liked was the one with Bugs and Daffy going to jail
<Dken2021> horses?
<Spademagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSq8D_cQlog&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 I love this track for some reason
<AJIsAwesome> Everyone has different opinions, okay? Some people may not like what you like, but that doesn't mean you should insult their opinions.

<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I'm sorry......i just watched an ep, and ended up frustrated :(:'(
<flutter_spin> Zamer: http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/57742 :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> o.O
<Zamer> for me I can't stand the multple different cgi/art styles they did for the roadrunner segments
<AJIsAwesome> Lola, IMO shouldn't be a sex symbol like she was in Space Jam.
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: Me too, I love that shes a cloud cookoolander too.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> aight you fizz heads, I;m off to bed. Y'alll behave now, ya hear?

<cachi01|mobile> But the looney toons show is awesome
<Spademagnes[R]> Remind me.. who was Lola again?
<Dark92Enigma> By the way is it true that there's a WIZARD (the movie) themed episode

<cachi01|mobile> ^*
<cachi01|mobile> ^^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> So who's taking over now?
<Zamer> I thought we agreed Balto was the reason why people turned into furries
