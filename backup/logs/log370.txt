<LordCelestia> 0,5How do I make mIRC stop asking me to register? Its been over 30 days...
<dashiee> helooooo ponies!
<LordCelestia> 0,5And its annoying t oclick every time...
<Placebo> Solution:
<Placebo> Don't use mIRC
<CK|Asleep> Or just don't be lazy and keep telling it no. Have used it for years and never paid. :p
<dashiee> ummm .... regeister ?
<Tarku> ohai LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> 0,5No, registering costs money
<dashiee> ok then keep telling it no :P
<Tarku> 20$ to be exact
<alexxm> hey did i miss much
<LordCelestia> 0,5But
<Tarku> ohai alexxm
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ummm...register it?
<LordCelestia> 0,5But that costs money!
<LordCelestia> 0,5Money that I dont need tos pend on it!
<alexxm> hey Tarku have i missed much
<Tarku> not really, how long were you away
<Placebo> There are plenty of free irc clients out there..
<Placebo> I'm sure you could find a file that would take away the register screen for it, as well.
<LordCelestia> 0,5And I am using mIRC
<LordCelestia> 0,5hm.
<Placebo> Othen than that, probably just have to deal with it.
<alexxm> since i went to sleep at around 2:00 ish
<LordCelestia> 0,5Nah, I know theres a way to get ri of it
<CK|Asleep> <CK|Asleep> Or just don't be lazy and keep telling it no. Have used it for years and never paid. :p <-----

<Jim> yeah, I have an æ, ø and å on my keyboard
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Phase4.
<Fazana> O_e

<ScienceLawnchair> Lyra finally became human. There's just one problem. . . http://i39.tinypic.com/35m4a5h.jpg
<Kammerjunk> åøæåøæå

<loganlogan360> jemand deutsch sprechen?
<alexxm> who is best pony
<Kammerjunk> Danish keyboard here.
<PinkiePie101> rainbow dash
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Twilight, obviously.
<Fazana> English Keyboard
<ScienceLawnchair> Celestia is best pony.
<Kammerjunk> Right next to Trixie
<Fazana> Fazana pony is best pony
<KwakLad> Poor Lyra
<Jim> loganlogan360: Not much, but I understand it
<Kammerjunk> And thus, Twixie is best ship.
<loganlogan360> :3
<Fazana> Twixie is best choccy bar
<Kammerjunk> Now I feel like going to danish equivalent of a convenience store and get some Twix.
<Kammerjunk> going to the Danish*
<xles> The sweet and carbsome twixie.
<KwakLad> Imma gonna getta Danish now
<Jim> So good and delicious
<Fazana> I want to go to the English equivilent of a convienience store (Corner shop in our country) and get some Red Bull
<KwakLad> Fazana or off-license
<Kammerjunk> Problem is that I have no dosh in cash.
<xles> I'd go to the Swedish equivalent, but I'm broke, tired from shoveling snow, and wya too lazy.
<Fazana> Depends, off licencies tend to be newsagents nowadays
<KwakLad> Or village shop
<KwakLad> they arent always on corners
<Fazana> Mine is :)
<Fazana> It's on the corner before a snicket
<KwakLad> Admittedly mine is, but the gap between the corner and the adjacent buiting is about 10 cm wide
<alexxm> the village shop is a local shop for local people there's nothing for you here
<Fazana> My shop is about 3 roads away
<KwakLad> I live where Leuge of gentlemen is set
<KwakLad> well film
<Fazana> Go halfway down the road I live and go into a shot roa
<KwakLad> filmed
<Fazana> Then go to the end of the 100 meter road into the snikcet
<KwakLad> damn my typing has gone out the window
<alexxm> mines preaty much just round the corner but it's got a lidl's just a few doors down

<KwakLad> Imma go lie down for a short while folks
<ekips> good rest to you KwakLad
<Kammerjunk> See you later, then.
<Jim> sleep tight KwakLad
<ekips> and I still own not one mlp merchandise
<xles> Ponymon, gotta catch 'em all.
<xles> ekips: likewise
<emangamer> ekips: what is wrong with you....
<ekips> the better question is, what is wrong with the stores in my radius, emangamer?
<Kammerjunk> Neither do I. But that's because the nearest toy store selling ponies is a few miles away.
<emangamer> ekips: good point. I apologise
<Kammerjunk> And with a few, I mean 7.
<Kammerjunk> And my bike is broken.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: thats why god invented cars
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, DCD.
<NewDCD> 09,01mornin'
<NewDCD> 09,01no stream eh?
<ekips> it's okay eman :>
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: I'm 15.
<NewDCD> 09,01let's fix that
<Jim> ohai dcd
<Jim> Let me guess, it's time for "Oh, japan~"
<DWR_Drawing> Kammerjunk 7 mile walk? That's nothing.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: thats why god invented hotwiring
<Kammerjunk> No, but it's BORING.
<DWR_Drawing> Get an MP3
<emangamer> DWR_Drawing: you mean 14 mile walk...
<DWR_Drawing> Of course^
<DWR_Drawing> forgot the trip back.
<NewDCD> 09,01naw
<Kammerjunk> If I was able to read while doing so, I would.
<Kammerjunk> But having a book in the wind we get here is a bad idea.
<NewDCD> 09,01time for something I haven't streamed in a while
<Jim> Get a kindle
<DWR_Drawing> Fourze?
<ekips> i dont even know the next store that sells mlp stuff
<emangamer> NewDCD: Danny phantom?
<Fazana> I don't know ANY store that sells MLP stuff
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: is there a mcdonalds near you? they have started to resell MLP stuff
<Fazana> Argos MIGHT. but I dunno
<emangamer> Fazana: McD's in a little while
<ekips> do you have ergo proxy?
<Kammerjunk> They have? Or is that just in the US?
<DWR_Drawing> emangamer They have? I need to check UK ones then.
<Fazana> O_e, WHAT
<DWR_Drawing> Because the UK sucks when it comes to buying pony.
<Fazana> *Wants neice to go to maccies and get a kidsmeal
<emangamer> Kammerjunk and DWR_Drawing IDK about elsewhere but they have in the US
<Fazana> UK sucks for fandom. Full stop.
<DWR_Drawing> ^
<Kammerjunk> Dat full stop.
<Jim> Imagine living in northern Norway
<DWR_Drawing> Except shows that orignate in the UK.
<DWR_Drawing> Like Doctor Who
<Jim> There's basicly nothing here
<emangamer> MOTHER OF GOD: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ825nDKTDs/Tzy-lcB813I/AAAAAAAAfOY/Pi0Efohsw6E/s1600/1.jpg
<Fazana> Doctor who is probably the only decent UK show
<DWR_Drawing> Nice.
<Fazana> that I can think of right now
<Fazana> Monty python was brill
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: See, you would NEVER see that over here.
<emangamer> no fucking way: http://www.etsy.com/listing/92894838/made-to-order-gummy-plushie-pattern?ref=af_shop_favitem
<Jim> emangamer: That's awesome
<Kammerjunk> The guys at the pizza store would be like "What?"
<emangamer> but gummy doesn't give enough fucks to be a plushie
<DWR_Drawing> Or they would not bother drawing anything Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> That too.
<Fazana> Gummy gives NO fucks.
<DWR_Drawing> But if I was to work at a pizza store...Then that would be entirely different.
<Kammerjunk> I think Gummy needs to seriously calm down.
<emangamer> GUYS: Bronies react to Teens react to MLP
<ekips> if only i could draw decently, I'd subtly share mlp art in our school
<Fazana> Btw, what is DCD gonna stream?
<emangamer> this should be promising
<NewDCD> 09,01it's a sur-priiiise
<Kammerjunk> ekips: You don't need drawing capabilities for that.
<Jim> emangamer: Some of those teens are REALLY stupid
<NewDCD> 09,01also Fazana: Sherlock
<Fazana> AGH, you startled me :(
<emangamer> Jim: but the BRONIES are reacting to the video
<DWR_Drawing> emangamer The only good thing about that teens react vid was the one guy who said he was going to check out the show.
<Kammerjunk> I hang up posters of Dashie saluting in front of the Danish flag on a regular basis.
<Jim> emangamer: Wait, what
<Jim> Oh my
<emangamer> DWR_Drawing: its BRONIES REACT to teens react
<DWR_Drawing> Other than that, I lost all humanity in teens even though I am one.
*Jim needs to watch that
<ekips> Kammerjunk but it becomes easier
<Fazana> Same
<emangamer> reactcpetion

*emangamer hugs #bronystate
*DWR_Drawing pats emangamer on the forehead
*Yellowquiet1 hugs emangamer
<Fazana> Oh dear
<Fazana> I've found it
<Kammerjunk> I had such a hard time watching the Teens React to My Little Pony video.
<Kammerjunk> I wasn't sure whether to laugh at their obliviousness, rage at their shallowness or be ashamed of being in that age group.
<alexxm> not trying to defend them but they were only shown the intro
<LunaTheBeloved> Morning everypony
<Kammerjunk> That's true.
<Fazana> I'm completely oblivious! "I'm well aware!"
<ekips> heya LunaTheBeloved
<alexxm> hey Luna
<Kammerjunk> But I doubt it'd matter.
<Yellowquiet1> Hi
<Kammerjunk> If you watch something with a set opinion, it's irrelevant how good it is.
<alexxm> i mean i'm sure i'm not the only one who skips the intro
*Yellowquiet1 hugs LunaTheBeloved
<Kammerjunk> Also, I just saw a Dark Side of the Rainboom T-shirt.
<Kammerjunk> Do want.
<ekips> Kammerjunk I had a set opinion of mlp before watching fim
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Yellowquiet1
<ekips> and now I am here
<Kammerjunk> But you can't have been that closeminded, then, since you realised that oh dear, this show is absolutely amazing.
<Fazana> Before I watched MLPFIM, I used to hate it.
<Kammerjunk> I didn't.
<Kammerjunk> I just scrolled past the threads on /b/.
<Kammerjunk> Hating something is so much work than not hating something, anyway.
<xcanox> Oh my god.
<Yellowquiet1> http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7872487-hang-in-there-pony i want that ^^
<LunaTheBeloved> That is awesome
<Kammerjunk> It is.
<Yellowquiet1> do they send into luxemburg ?
<alexxm> before august i didn't even know we were a thing
<ekips> i can't believe it is almost a year since i joined the fandom ~.~
<Yellowquiet1> brb
<Fazana> Almost half a year for me
<ScootaChicken> I've been watching it since September
<ScootaChicken> I just remembered, what happened in September...
<ekips> i see what you did there
<ScootaChicken> Oh wait, I just realised something
<ScootaChicken> Wrek isn't here.
<ScootaChicken> allcaps time.
<xcanox> I DO NOT DISAGREE
<LunaTheBeloved> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<xcanox> But I don't agree either.
<alexxm> i've been a brony since august so i recken just about 7 months since i became a brony
<LunaTheBeloved> Same here
<Kammerjunk> TRADITIONAL ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE ACTIVATE.
<Kammerjunk> But anyway.
<xcanox> CANTERLOCK
<LunaTheBeloved> CAPS LOCK ALL THE WAAAAAAAAY!!!!
<LunaTheBeloved> inb4 Wrek shows up
<Kammerjunk> Does anypony know where I can find a picture of sewed-on Rainbow Dash army badges?
<Fazana> Um, can I please ask you top stop that shouting, you're making the citezens nervous
<ekips> oh no, captain capslock and his capital letter crew is sailing again
<xcanox> lol
<xcanox> ekips: You just genuinely made my day. :D
<NewDCD> 09,01signal alright?
<ekips> you're welcome xcanox :>
<xcanox> Try saying "Captian Capslock and his Capital Letter Crew" five times fast.
<alexxm> what game is this
<NewDCD> 09,01SRW Z2 - World Destruction Chapter
<ekips> sound is a little bit rough
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah that's due to it coming from a PSP
<Kammerjunk> xcanox: Having a habit of pronouncing "captain" as "cap'n" makes it a little easier.
<NewDCD> 09,01nothing can be done about that (but during gameplay, the music masks the static, anyways)
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Wrek.
<ekips> heya wrek
<Wrek> 05hey hey hey
<alexxm> hey Wrek
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello Wrek and NewDCD
<Fazana> Haeylo
<xcanox> I challenge the banhammer!
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Nelly.
<xcanox> I fought the law and the law won.
<ekips> why did you have to remind me of THAT wrek?
<alexxm> is gaogaigar in this game
<Fazana> What? Krusty the clown?
<Kammerjunk> Trixie shirts! YAY
<NewDCD> 09,01not in this SRW, but GaoGaiGar was in SRW Alpha 2, 3 and W
<Fazana> Oh I know this game
<alexxm> ok
<Fazana> I forget the ENGLISH name.
<xcanox> So I heard Derpy's voice.
<ekips> Is code geass in here?
<Kammerjunk> "A Mishap with the Elements of Harmony leave Twilight and Discord with each others powers." I am so reading that.
<xcanox> She sounds derpy. B|
<NewDCD> 09,01ekips: eeyup, Got Lelouch, Todoh and Karen deployed

<Kammerjunk> Randomnerd: Our pixel art will block out the Sun!
<xcanox> ScootaChicken fought the law and the law won.
<ScootaChicken> xcanox's mother was a tailor, she sewed his new blue jeans
<ScootaChicken> his father was a gambling man, down in New Orleans
<Randomnerd> Kammerjunk: Then we shall derp in the shade.

*Fazana hides
<Yellowquiet1> wb jim
<Jim> Welcome back Yellowquiet1
<Kammerjunk> Resaluta, Jim et Yellowquiet1.
<Yellowquiet1> ^^
<ScootaChicken> Kammerjunk: judging by Luna's facebook, she's doing a lot of ACTAvism.
<Kammerjunk> That's nice.
<NewDCD> 09,01Yeah she is
<Kammerjunk> I'm hopefully going to a protest in Copenhagen on the 25th.
<NewDCD> 09,01Big Sister is the best <3
<ScootaChicken> I did some IRL ACTAvism
<ekips> enemy phase..dun dun DUNN
<PrototypeX9000> whats up? Hows everypony today?
<ScootaChicken> that was fun
<Jim> ohai PrototypeX9000
<alexxm> i'm good
<Fazana> The cieling is iup and I'm fine
<Kammerjunk> PrototypeX9000: Bene, gratia. Et tu?
<PrototypeX9000> wha?
<Kammerjunk> Never mind.
<Jim> Fazana: The earth is round, there is no up or down
<Fazana> Fine thanks, you too?
<Kammerjunk> I'm good. What about you?
<Fazana> That's what Kammer said
<ekips> Jim blasphemy!
<Kammerjunk> Literally, yes.
<Fazana> It's spanish
<Kammerjunk> It's Latin.
<PrototypeX9000> just trying to figure out something to do
<alexxm> gundams in this game odd i thought it was one of the more realstic series
<Fazana> Really?
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<PrototypeX9000> and what is on stream?
<Fazana> Looks loads like Spanish
<NewDCD> 09,01Gundams are the classic representatives of "Real Robot" types in SRW
<alexxm> dat rider kick
<alexxm> ok thanks
<NewDCD> 09,01that is, Low Defense, "realistic weapons", high evasion
<NewDCD> 09,01"Super Robots" are high defense, flashy moves, low evasion...basically tankier
<ekips> inb4 crit
<Kammerjunk> Fazana: Spanish is, as well as French and Italian, romantic languages.
<NewDCD> 09,01Crowe is so boss <3
<alexxm> so where would an eva fall under then
<NewDCD> 09,01EVAs are considered Hybrids, it's a huge debate
<PrototypeX9000> is this a game or like a vid we are watching...
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what's going on anymore.
<NewDCD> 09,01but in the game they play kind of like Supers with high evasion
<alexxm> ok
<NewDCD> 09,01and Proto: I'm playing
<PrototypeX9000> oh ok
<LunarKing> heyo
<alexxm> i don't japanese i just enjoy watching the fights in this game
<NewDCD> 09,01same.
<PrototypeX9000> the fights are kinda cool
<ekips> the battle scenes are so long
<Fazana> What the hell
<NewDCD> 09,01you can turn them off but what's the fun in that
<Fazana> He got ripped apart, and survives it
<Fazana> then comes together again
<alexxm> that's what i meant i enjoy watching
<NewDCD> 09,01SRW LOGIC.
<ekips> Fazana: oh, japan~
<Fazana> O_e
<Fazana> *Mind....blown*
<Jim> oh I forgot that it's Oh, Japan~ time
<Scavender> Hello everypony, back from work, so whats on ?
<alexxm> so where would something like a super sentais mech fall under
<Yellowquiet1> hi Scavender
<Jim> Welcome back Scavender
<PrototypeX9000> WHat up Scavender
<ekips> are there medabots in this :3
<alexxm> hey Scavender
<NewDCD> 09,01>Medabots
<NewDCD> 09,01that'd be HILAROUS
<NewDCD> 09,01ohai Big Macintosh Cuvie
<Randomnerd> Hm... Hey Ocean! is nice :)
<NewDCD> 09,01Yes, Heero just sliced those missiles
<Fazana> Seems legit
<alexxm> NewDCD would a super sentais mech be conserded a super robot then
<Jim> Airplane got blasted
<ekips> nope
<NewDCD> 09,01DEFINITELY.
<Yellowquiet1> what s the point in this game
<NewDCD> 09,01hot blood.
<NewDCD> 09,01that's the point.
<Jim> The point is cool fight scenes it seems
<alexxm> ok still new to mech series
<NewDCD> 09,01I really gotta stream Getter
<alexxm> only seen gurren lagann and gaogargai
<Yellowquiet1> Oh Japan~
<LunarKing> is wrek streamin?
<Fazana> No.
<Fazana> DCD is
<LunarKing> oh
<Jim> Suddenly, face
<alexxm> oh so this fight is after kamina died then
<PrototypeX9000> y no one die yet?
<Fazana> Rapeface
<NewDCD> 09,01this is the fight against the four generals (as in the movie)
<alexxm> ok
<PrototypeX9000> What movie?
<NewDCD> 09,01after this comes Teppelin
<NewDCD> 09,01Gurren-Hen
<ekips> if this is in the gurrenn universe, how did the other mechs get there?
<Fazana> inb4rapeface
<NewDCD> 09,01nah this is the SRW Z Universe....Orguss' dimension bomb went off, and then, Shenanigans
<Jim> Does that thing refill its life all the time?
<alexxm> do u chosse what move the mechs do or do u only move them
<NewDCD> 09,01the stories are all interconnected
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah I choose the attacks
<Fazana> There's 4 options
<Dken2021> good after-morning people
<alexxm> thanks for telling
<NewDCD> 09,01more, it all depends on the mech
<Jim> ohai Dken2021
<Fazana> execute, battle scene toggle, what moves to use, and summat else
<Scavender> Hi
<Fazana> Might be items or summat
<Dken2021> would this be live or DCD's auto playlist thingie?

<Fazana> No, just Japanese
<LunarKing> *crash* BOOM
<Sumica> 00,10bleh I slpet in. too much dickingaround with trying to mod minecraft.
<PrototypeX9000> so just wondering...you understand this or u just guessing
<Dken2021> lemme guess, mine little pony?
<Fazana> Sumica: What are you doing?
<Fazana> Jiggle....-_- Oh japan/
<Sumica> 00,10was trying to get build craft to work.
<Morty> ohai
<alexxm> am i the only one who thought this game would have been something like dynasty warriors instead of a stragry game no offense NewDCD
<Fazana> I want a Techniks server
<Dken2021> oh boy, buildcraft....
<NewDCD> 09,01BIG O
<PrototypeX9000> ok...whats Buildcraft?
<NewDCD> 09,01SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTAIMU
<Sumica> 00,10Dynasty warriors + Ponies.
<Fazana> = Dynasty Ponies
<Jim> sounds interesting
<Dken2021> wait, what's japanese batman doing here?
<Fazana> Haha
<NewDCD> 09,01being awesome
<NewDCD> 09,01that's what
<Fazana> :)
<alexxm> how is this guy japanese batman
<Morty> big o game...?
<Sumica> 00,10I am saddend by the lack of gekostate here
<Dken2021> and yes, I know the anime's has nothing to do with batman, but he's just reminds me so much of it
<NewDCD> 09,01there's Nirvash Spec V
<NewDCD> 09,01but that's just fabulous and not awesome
<Sumica> 00,10Getter crotch lazor
<ekips> advance wars is best handheld strategy
<PrototypeX9000> as anyone ever heard of a game for gamecube i assume, called Custom Robo
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah I have
<Scavender> Yay purple ray of death ...
<alexxm> how come this game hasan't been bought over here yet
<Morty> wait what the heck is this?
<Morty> i see gundams and big O
<NewDCD> 09,01alexxm: because COPYRIGHT NIGHTMARE
<alexxm> gurren laggan is also involved
<NewDCD> 09,01and Morty: Super Robot Wars Z2 - The World Destruction Chapter
<alexxm> ok
<Sumica> 00,10oh movie nervash
<Morty> is it just like every mecha ever crammed in one?
<Sumica> 00,10more or less
<alexxm> i think so
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah but with a coherent and incredibly enjoyable plot (we can't understand boo hoo)
<Sumica> 00,10spinny death
<Jim> He better be dead now
<Jim> Because that's kind of overkill
<alexxm> has this series had EVA's in it
<ekips> inb4 crit
<Morty> i dont understand the combat...
<PrototypeX9000> :D
<NewDCD> 09,01F/F Final, Alpha 1 and 3, MX, Rebuild in one of the DS games
<Scavender> Me neither, but its okay
<alexxm> ok thanks
<NewDCD> 09,01and the worst part is SRW is semi-canon to the EVA canon
<alexxm> how is it semi canon
<xcanox> Again pinged by the Canon Monster.
<NewDCD> 09,01(Kaworu hints in Rebuild he's the same Kaworu as all those games, because in those games, Kaworu is an "arbitrator"/implied to be one of the series' Time Divers)
<xcanox> Client: Y U PING ME WHEN "CANON" IS SED?
<PrototypeX9000> Man i really need something to do
<NewDCD> 09,01and Anno wrote several of the SRW scenarios involving EVA
<PrototypeX9000> wth?
<PrototypeX9000> guy got a walking battleship
<alexxm> ok anyone else who wrote the orignal series write anything for the games
<Morty> so u drag a mech on a bad robot, then tons of cutscene and victory?
<ekips> whats the name of that walking battleship again?
<alexxm> dai gurren
<NewDCD> 09,01not that I know of, EVA is an interesting case because SRW might be canon to it
<NewDCD> 09,01and Morty: Think Fire Emblem with more eye candy
<alexxm> ok
<Morty> yeah thats what i was thinking
<Morty> oh i actually know this one
<Morty> its uh
<alexxm> was that guy japanese V
<Morty> shit
<ekips> more or less alexxm
<alexxm> ok thanks ekips
<NewDCD> 09,01KYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODAIIIIIIIII GATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI
<NewDCD> 09,01or "Sibling Combination"
<ekips> Oo
<PrototypeX9000> 10? really?
<alexxm> i never got that comboantion i mean yay "yay i get to sit around and be used as a weapon"
<Jim> Why does that thing remind me of a banana?
<Dken2021> dat measly 10 hp
<KwakLad> TTGL?
<KwakLad> or some graphic novel variation?
<PrototypeX9000> here the overkill again
<ekips> jim something must be wrong with your mind sorry
<NewDCD> 09,01Prototype: I casted a "Spirit Command" that makes the next attack the unit recieves be reduced to 10 damage (the 1 HP equivalent of this game)
<KwakLad> oh game equivalent?
<PrototypeX9000> oh
<KwakLad> btw hi again
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah least damage you can take is 10
<Dken2021> hi KwakLad
<PrototypeX9000> ok
<alexxm> hi KwakLad
<Morty> code geass?
<Morty> is that it?
<Scavender> Kaboom
<NewDCD> 09,01there are other commands that increase damage, make the next attack have a 100% hit chance, make the next attack by the enemy miss obligatorily, increase your hit chance and decrease their hit chance...and they consume SP
<Morty> purple eyes guy?
<Dken2021> the animations sure are stunning
<dashiee> hello everypony
<Dken2021> hey dashiee
<PrototypeX9000> Sup Dashiee
<Jim> Ohai dashiee
<Morty> ohai dashiee
<KwakLad> hello dashiee
<ekips> heya dashiee
<Scavender> Hello
<Morty> use teh burning gundam!
<Jim> Drive me closer, I want to hit them with my sword.
<dashiee> so what are we watchin?
<Scavender> I can imagine this game can become boring over time...
<NewDCD> 09,01I would, I use it all the time in A Portable
<NewDCD> 09,01nah, you got TOO MANY ROBOTS to get bored
<Jim> You won't feel alone when you have SO MANY ROBOTS!
<Scavender> Well maybe its because I dont play, and dont uderstand what is going on very well.
<PrototypeX9000> of course this has my attention cuz i kinda like strtegy fames
<PrototypeX9000> games*
<Jim> So many robots for luna on the moon
<Sharakan> my god this game looks epic
<NewDCD> 09,01it's funny, a robot in this game has a BANISHED TO THE MOON PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
<ekips> inb4 20 damange
<alexxm> this has got my attention because of the cut scnes
<NewDCD> 09,01but we had a route split
<NewDCD> 09,01so it's not available atm
<Morty> burning!
<Morty> y u no use burning?
<alexxm> don't forget if this game does follow gurren laganns story the moon is a robot
<NewDCD> 09,01Burning isn't in this SRW. I use it in the games that has it
<NewDCD> 09,01you should try SRW J, it got translated
<shadex> epic sprites
<NewDCD> 09,01for GBA
<Morty> i thought i saw it o.O
<NewDCD> 09,01it has G Gundam units
<Scavender> He shot two freezing missiles with his sword :D
<Scavender> Nice, got my attention
<Morty> who is up and to the left of big O NewDCD
<shadex> gundam <3
<PrototypeX9000> is this for someone like on an emulator or console...or is it on the PC?
<Dken2021> official translation or fan translation?
<NewDCD> 09,01fan
<PrototypeX9000> something*
<Dken2021> ah
<NewDCD> 09,01no main series SRW has gotten translated due to COPYRIGHT NIGHTMARE
<NewDCD> 09,01this one's on PSP
<PrototypeX9000> oh ok
<alexxm> who's missle launcher shoulder guy
<NewDCD> 09,01Chirico Cuvie from VOTOMs...which I plan to stream soon
<Morty> is that hero?
<Morty> ima just look it up
<PrototypeX9000> and i assume there isnt an english version?
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah
<PrototypeX9000> ok i thought so
<NewDCD> 09,01and Morty yeah that was Heero
<Jim> http://scottthong.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/twisparhammer40k.jpg
<PrototypeX9000> Jim: Lol
<Scavender> Heh
<alexxm> ok whos overkill guy
<Jim> This game's got amazing fight scenes
<PrototypeX9000> lmao
<NewDCD> 09,01Crowe Broust, Banpresto Original Character for this game
<alexxm> that just took someone on
<alexxm> ok
<PrototypeX9000> and he's ok!
<Morty> wing gundam looks alot like burning
<Jim> 29500 hp, seems legit
<Morty> oh noes big O!
<NewDCD> 09,01pretty much all main Gundams look like the RX-78
<Morty> big o likes to pawnch
<PrototypeX9000> it attacks! You win!
<PrototypeX9000> lol
<alexxm> NewDCD how is big o like batman i've never seen it
<Dken2021> it's not
<alexxm> ok
<NewDCD> 09,01the art style and mood is a lot like Batman The Animated Series
<Morty> i think he is like batman
<alexxm> oh ok
<NewDCD> 09,01and the main character is a dude that lives in a mansion, has a badass butler, and has awesome gadgets
<NewDCD> 09,01otherwise he's not that much like Bats
<alexxm> ok
<NewDCD> 09,01he's more like Bruce Wayne if he fought crime without a secret identity
<Morty> i think roger and bruce wayne are similar
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah they are
<Morty> stoic serious types
<Randomnerd> Holy shit, this credit card bill.
<Morty> and they both have awkward friendships with th epolice chiefs
<Randomnerd> Fuck fuck fuck...
<Morty> o.O
<KwakLad> whats up Randomnerd?
<Scavender> There is not much enemies left, is it ?
<Jim> Bought too many ponies?
<Randomnerd> It's just really steep. I'm the most self-destructive idiot I know.
<NewDCD> 09,01I think not, but chances are enemy reinforcements will arrive
<Morty> dat buster canon
<alexxm> since when were gundams transformers
<NewDCD> 09,01since Zeta's WaveRider mode
<PrototypeX9000> must eat food...ill brb
<alexxm> ok as i said only seen part of gaogaigar and gurren lagann and thats the extent of my mech knowledge
<Morty> use mic sounders!
<NewDCD> 09,01...if only he was in Z2 ;____;
<NewDCD> 09,01he's in the Alpha Games though
<alexxm> would the denliner be conserded a mech
<NewDCD> 09,01I don't think so. And quite frankly Den-O sucks.
<ekips> definately not a crit
<alexxm> ok just wondering
<Morty> lol y do those missles never do shit?
<NewDCD> 09,01because I'm the best at what I do
<Morty> stream things from japan to bronies?
<ekips> GIGADRILL
<Scavender> Taste my drillbit sucker
<alexxm> giga drill breaker is best finisher
<Randomnerd> Still looking for a real god damn job.
<Scavender> Spiky guy
<otakon> YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

<alexxm> how come it has 3 pilots
<otakon> no
<otakon> bc it does
<alexxm> ok
<otakon> One pilots, the other two use suppor skills
<otakon> it's probably a combiner
<alexxm> ok thanks
<NewDCD> 09,01One watches the energy systems, another is the engineer, and the guy that looks like Apollo Justice is the main pilot
<paradise92> ...
<alexxm> thanks
<otakon> NewDCD: YES YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD!!!!
<PrototypeX9000> has there been a PS1 emulator been made yet?
<otakon> NewDCD: also, where's your nick at?

<paradise92> lol
<otakon> PrototypeX9000: CoolRom.com
<PrototypeX9000> ok
<otakon> boom, done
<otakon> but finding .iso files is MUCH harder
<paradise92> nah
<paradise92> it isn't
<alexxm> are these games only on handhelds
<otakon> well for me it is
<paradise92> want a site for roms?
<otakon> alexxm: They came out only in Japan really

<NewDCD> 09,01just use torrents
<paradise92> otakon want a site for roms?
<nido> as does anyone with a link to google?
<Dumori> They are mostly Japan only mostly due to licenencing

<Scavender> Spiky guy is spiky...
<otakon> paradise92: I hae a site for roms, I need .iso files
<paradise92> well that

<paradise92> it contains everything
<NewDCD> 09,01eeyup
<otakon> IN A VOTOM!
<Dumori> it would be insanely wanglely and expencive to get the rites to do a NA and EU port
<otakon> damn
<Dumori> thus patches are all you can hope for
<otakon> Dumori: it would and it SUCKSSSSS!!! We only got TWO real SRT games here

<otakon> NewDCD: OG2, final true boss with the 7 turn limit......

<otakon> paradise92: you'll still need to be online for it to work
<Scavender> I used to like diablo 2, but it got boring after some years.
<alexxm> thanks NewDCD
<otakon> NewDCD: ever see it? Looks interesting
<Morty> look out popo!
<otakon> seriously who IS this guy in the Votom?
<paradise92> otakon dude...mw3 is hacked in 2 days :D :D well that is because it uses the same files as mw2 :/
<NewDCD> 09,01nope but it's Happy Tomino so it must be good
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon: He's the main character of VOTOMs....and an absolute boss
<paradise92> GUys
<paradise92> Do you have Tunngle?
<paradise92> If you do lets play
<Morty> amazing!
<paradise92> Titan Quest :D :D
<otakon> NewDCD: Happy Tomino? oh god, he's the one that usually kills off his characters isn't he?
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah
<paradise92> ??
<Sumica> 00,10......this mod is making me want to punch walls.
<NewDCD> 09,01but he did that when struggling with depression
<Morty> that inner robot is so kawaii :'D
<NewDCD> 09,01by Gainer, he wasn't depressed
<Scavender> How so ?
<Morty> KAWAAAIIII
<otakon> NewDCD: didn't he blow up one chick with a explosive device in her NECK?
<Morty> jk jk
<otakon> hiya Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10hi otakon
<NewDCD> 09,01wouldn't be surprised, sounds like Tomino
<otakon> damn
<otakon> Renton cannot take a hit worth a damn
<Morty> kawaii!
<alexxm> whats the robot with the staff
<otakon> NewDCD: you might want to dodge next time
<NewDCD> 09,01I'll defend instead
<otakon> alexxm: no idea, but it's from Eureka 7
<alexxm> ok thanks
<NewDCD> 09,01I think Renton has prevailed
<Morty> popo poses no real threat guys
<NewDCD> 09,01as he gets damaged, his stats get buffed as well
<Morty> he just looks scary
<otakon> NewDCD: but it's a dodge type! it doesn't have the defense for that!
<NewDCD> 09,01so once he's in low health, enemies hit chance become zero
<otakon> okay
<paradise92> ...
<paradise92> sooo
<otakon> mfw hes 1 shot KO'd
<paradise92> not cool
<gary> yo
*The_4th_Wall looks for a never never never loop
<otakon> hiya gary
<Morty> otakon: on the plus side, if he gets hit it might hurt that annoying inner voice that mech has
<NewDCD> 09,01Defend an approximately 4000 attack = about 2100 damage......still in a good position
<otakon> Morty: but I like it
<otakon> it's less annoying than Navi that's for sure
<gary> have you seen friendship is witchcraft?
<otakon> crap
<otakon> CRAP
<PrototypeX9000> wtf?
<otakon> Battlship
<otakon> this is gonna hurt
<alexxm> anythings less anoyning than navi otakon
<Morty> wtf did i just see an evil dolphin!?

<otakon> Dolphins are EVIL
<otakon> Guarme!
<Jim> oh, japan~

<Jim> 34500 hp, wow
<otakon> damn that thing

<otakon> Jim: that's NOTHING!!! There are bosses with HP counts into the MILLIONS
<PrototypeX9000> Dolphins are from outer space...
<Morty> can every robot heal itself?
<otakon> Morty: no sadly
<Jim> It's the most I've seen here (I've never played the game mind you)
<Morty> gurren lagaan
<otakon> Morty: though there are pilots that can heal other bots and some have auto repair and there are accessories that allow you to heal other bots
<KwakLad> was wondering where she was
<ekips> i'm off to play tribes: ascend, cee ya all
<Scavender> YAY
<NewDCD> 09,01and some have Spirit Commands that heal you
<otakon> oh, oppai shot how I've missed you

<NewDCD> 09,01since the Gurren-hen movie
<otakon> alexxm: in the movie IIRC
<paradise92> ekips and don't break a pinkie promise
<Morty> that robot that is half a sphere is dumb. it gets least cool robot award
<alexxm> ok
<otakon> Morty: it's a tankbot
<Morty> its Tom as a robot
<otakon> YES!
<otakon> Tom would be a super for sure in this
<paradise92> sooo um
<alexxm> i heard Tom was going to wrestle cena this year
<Morty> urooko outo helre comues Tomu!
<Kammerjunk> Do any of you ever have that feel when you just have no idea what the hay to play?
<Morty> (look out here comes Tom)
<PrototypeX9000> Kammerjunk: Yeah
<otakon> Morty: a basic classification of the types of robots used in this is Real Type or Super Type. Super's are all flashy OP attacks and usually are tanks and Real Types use guns/lasers and are usually good dodgers.
<paradise92> NewDCD are you japanese or do you have some sorth of super natural power to read japanese?
<NewDCD> 09,01nah SRW is easy to learn to play
<NewDCD> 09,01just play the translated games
<paradise92> NewDCD just like batman...
<Kammerjunk> Oh good, so it's not just me.
<otakon> yes
<NewDCD> 09,01and understanding the menus become second nature
<otakon> god I wish I had this
<otakon> and could read japanese
<NewDCD> 09,01me too
<PrototypeX9000> i currently have that feel
*NewDCD is thinking on learning Japanese
<otakon> BIG O!!!! SHOW TIME!!!!!!
<paradise92> Hanna means Flower in Jap.
<Kammerjunk> I'd play some Amnesia, since I'm alone in the house, but Amnesia is best played at midnight.
<Morty> Tons Of Machines (T.O.M)
<otakon> NOW that is a Giant Robot!
<paradise92> Amnesia isn't scary
<otakon> goddamnit I love this music
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon: SURE PROMISE.mp3
<otakon> NewDCD: IKR!!!!
<Kammerjunk> paradise92: It's a very atmospheric thriller game.
<paradise92> Paranormal Activity is scary (only the first part)
<NewDCD> 09,01I also recommend Apologine - Bleecker Street from the Big O OST
<otakon> did BIG O DODGE?!?!?!?
<Kammerjunk> See, this is where it's subjective. I didn't find Paranormal Activity scary.
<otakon> holy SHIT!!!
<PrototypeX9000> i laughed through all of them paradise92
<otakon> I didn't even KNOW BIG O could DODGE!!!
<paradise92> you laughed...i cried in the corner
<PrototypeX9000> lmao
<Kammerjunk> And thus, it's subjective.
<Kammerjunk> You find X scary, I find Y scary.
<alexxm> i saw the first one sort of reminded me of a slenderman series
<otakon> hiya Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Hi, otakon.
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon: Strike + Alert in one Spirit Command : 3
<paradise92> FLYING DISCOO OF DOOOM!!!
<otakon> NewDCD: nice man, but it must be expensive. did you pick up SP regen for any of your pilots yet?
<derpy_at_lunch> Oh god please dont tell me you guys are watching big o
<NewDCD> 09,01don't think so, and it isn't
<NewDCD> 09,01Alert costs 10, Strike costs 15, the co-ed command is 20
<NewDCD> 09,01also DAT BOSS LOOKING AT THE EXPLOSION
<otakon> paradise92: you should see Boss Borot, he has an attack that literally throws EVERYTHING at an enemy.
<paradise92> GUYS MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!!!
<paradise92> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4lJ7f7ucxw&feature=g-all-u&context=G25ae3c0FAAAAAAAAAAA
<otakon> NewDCD: is Boss Borot in this one?
<paradise92> PLEASE GO SING THE PETITION!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01I think not
<NewDCD> 09,01maybe in the next game
<paradise92> I WANT FOR OFFICIALRAINBOWDASH2 TO CONTINUE PUTTING MLP VIDEOS
<Morty> paradise92 what's it for?
<paradise92> well hasbro stopped him from putting episodes of MLP
<paradise92> on youtube
<Morty> they wont allow it for 500 signatures
<NewDCD> 09,01time for NIA WRIGHT
<otakon> well paradise92 that's there right as the copyright holders if he was putting up eps of MLP
<PrototypeX9000> Super Battleship DudE!
<otakon> paradise92: if it was fanwork however, then I shall
<NewDCD> 09,01>implying Hasbro will allow you to re-upload their copyrighted content with 500 signatures
<otakon> oh he is SO BONED
<NewDCD> 09,01uhh, better open a new account man.
<paradise92> otakon but i don't have anywhere else to watch...sooo...
<Morty> if i can find 500 thugs who think armed robbery is ok I cant just go have them send a letter to congress
<otakon> paradise92: search
<otakon> paradise92: but no, if it was for uploading MLP eps Hasbro is in the right I'm afraid
<Morty> actually, this is more like 500 people asking apple for free i phones
<paradise92> otakon and even if my tv channels would get it it would be horribly sinchronized...
<paradise92> just like dbz...
<otakon> paradise92: SEARCH.BUCKING.YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!
<paradise92> it sounds like porn when you close your eyes
<paradise92> NO
<otakon> paradise92: it's easy
<paradise92> otakon too.lazy.to.do.THAAAAT.
<otakon> paradise92: god
<Morty> ok can we end this now? obviously no one is signing
<otakon> indeed, I'm sorry but it's not going to make a difference either I'm afraid
<paradise92> ...
<paradise92> i just wanted to help out
<TrixieMuffin> AAAAAArrrrrrrgh !
<Morty> sorry paradise92 it just seems way too pointless
<otakon> hiya TrixieMuffin
<TrixieMuffin> hiya otakon
<paradise92> bastards...i hate you all
<NewDCD> 09,01paradise: you gotta understand copyright law a bit when you're an owner of a site like this. And I can safely tell you: that person is boned.
*paradise92 cries in the corner
<otakon> NewDCD: this guy was the inspiration for Rai wasn't he?
<NewDCD> 09,01nahhhh, Rai¿s...different
<CountDoofus> Dan Hibiki different?
<TrixieMuffin> im playing "I wanna be the boshy" 50 deaths so far on the first spiky thing
<NewDCD> 09,01but in all serious paradise, I wouldn't sign that petition if I were you.
<Morty> paradise92: im sowie...you cant just petition to break the law after youve been asked to stop
<NewDCD> 09,01it's dangerous, because if it gets submitted....
<otakon> NewDCD: really? your telling me he(who is a Ranged Real Dodge Type) and him aren't even a bit similar?
<otakon> yeah
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o is this one of the super robot wars games?
<NewDCD> 09,01Hasbro has the information of 500 potential copyright violators
<otakon> the SIGNERS will get blacklisted
<NewDCD> 09,01and you could get your ass prosecuted.
<paradise92> Boom baby
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: eeyup, enjoy the fireworks
*PrototypeX9000 lights Midnight_Tempest on fire
<CountDoofus> *gasp* it might be a Hasbro conspiracy!
<PrototypeX9000> take that...
*otakon puts out Midnight_Tempest immediately
<otakon> hiya CountDoofus
<PrototypeX9000> damn...
<paradise92> NewDCD FBI will be at my door for watching My Little Pony -_-
<CountDoofus> hi
*Morty steals Midnight_tempest's lunchmoney in all the commotion
<paradise92> NewDCD it would be "Equilibrium" all over the place
<PrototypeX9000> lmao
<CountDoofus> how long has this one fight been going on?
<NewDCD> 09,01paradise: hey, they fined a woman with a 1.5 million suit for downloading 24 songs off the internet.
<otakon> CountDoofus: a couple of turns
<Morty> GOD THAT pokuuuuuuuuuuuu!
<paradise92> NewDCD i knw that...
<otakon> Morty: it's so CUTE!!!
<TrixieMuffin> ok im switching to easy mode
<Morty> no its death
<otakon> I wonder if I can hug a energy core?
<Morty> i want to hug it with insulators
<paradise92> otakon you can "hug" my "energy core" :3
<otakon> NewDCD: WHY YOU NO USE KING KITTAN!!!!
<Morty> um
<otakon> paradise92: um indeed
<paradise92> Ooh My
<Morty> -_-
<NewDCD> 09,01bottom line is, you gotta be REALLY careful with what you do
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> with a sign list that small
<NewDCD> 09,01if you can unsign the petition, I'd recommend it
<paradise92> NewDCD true...
<Morty> POPO NOOOOO
<otakon> they probably could potentially track all involved
<otakon> on suspicion of copyright infringement or involvement with it
<otakon> ohgod
<CountDoofus> I wouldn't have to resort to YT if Apple could be arsed to put MLP episodes on European iTunes...
<Morty> NewDCD: a 500 person list petitiong the right to break copyright law? Hasbro won't even look at it
<otakon> CountDoofus: true, but thats a license issue I'm afraid
<Midnight_Tempest> lol Orguss
<otakon> here comes dodgy!
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: is THAT what they're saying?
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<otakon> it's a Super Fortress Macross bot isn't it?
<Midnight_Tempest> no
<Morty> omg a talking tapir!
<otakon> dodgy dodgerson
<Midnight_Tempest> its from the same people that made Macross though otakon
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: um, but the bot design and the music!
<NewDCD> 09,01Tempest, you were the guy that liked Orguss?
<Midnight_Tempest> ^_^
<otakon> NewDCD: what is Orguss from?
<Morty> Orgieus?
<NewDCD> 09,01from....Super Dimension Century Orguss
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<otakon> Damn artillery types, SO ANNOYING!!!!
<otakon> SO, Macross under aother name right?
<NewDCD> 09,01nope, it's pretty different
<NewDCD> 09,01it deals with alternate universe shenanigans
<otakon> despite having similar music
<Morty> wouldnt it be awkward for the high quality animation characters to meet the goofy animation characters?
<NewDCD> 09,01and it's a VITAL part to the plot of Z2
<otakon> similar mech designs and concepts
<Morty> wouldnt it be like meeting a freak?
<otakon> and similar character designs
<otakon> yh, completely different
<NewDCD> 09,01it's surprisingly seamless
<alexxm> alternate universe shennigans are best shennigans
<otakon> BIG O!!! SHOW TIME!!!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon: Both had character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto <3
<Morty> lol flash step Big O

<otakon> okay, THAT was funny
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: but he's a villain!
<Midnight_Tempest> BEST VILLIAN EVER!
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: technically
<Morty> ovaskillu
<NewDCD> 09,01Schwartzwald was in the first game
<otakon> dat King Gainer, such an od Mech design

<CountDoofus> well, in general
<otakon> NewDCD: herdmind
<Fazana> Actual Japanese girls look nothing like these anime girls
*NewDCD is more of an ass man anyways
<Ingwaz> CountDoofus: i'd prefer a woman whos bust size is actually proportional to her body rather than a woman whos specifically had surgery to increase her bust size
<otakon> not me
<Morty> from what ive gathered, NewCDC has it set up so all enemy attacks miss or dont do very much
<otakon> though I don't not appreciate a nice ass
<NewDCD> 09,01Morty: pretty much
<Ingwaz> lol otakon
<Fazana> @DCD http://www.retromodo.co.uk/img/p/15047-5921-large.jpg?
<otakon> lol
<CountDoofus> Ingwaz: totally agree
<PrototypeX9000> :D
<Morty> are they in defensive stances or something?
<Morty> how does one lose this game?
<otakon> Morty: no, just defensive skill
<KwakLad> Fazana no but i have seen 3 japanese girls wearing sailor suit uniforms walking through my village which was odd considering its a northern back water village :p
<otakon> Morty: it depends on the stage
<alexxm> i'm a fan of both ass and boobs
<Fazana> I was aimed at this "http://www.retromodo.co.uk/img/p/15047-5921-large.jpg"
<Fazana> Crap, mybad
<Fazana> Copy and paste = clunky >:c
<Morty> miss
<Morty> called it :p
<otakon> Morty: sometimes it's a time limit, other times it's getting wiped out, other times it's one unit's loss or other stuff
<Morty> i cant see a wipe out happening at this rate
<NewDCD> 09,01gotta take a phone call.
<otakon> Morty: there are some where you have to get an enemy down to a certain percentage of their HP WITHOUT destroying them
<otakon> NewDCD: save it at least!
<alexxm> how come
<otakon> bc it's importante!
<NewDCD> 09,01nevermind
<Morty> miss

<otakon> lol
<Fazana> Trolol
<Morty> called it again -_-

<CountDoofus> oh well. going to see the latest nostalgia critic video, then off to bed (at 8PM, bleh)

<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: 400GB for what?
<Ingwaz> pony pr0n
<Fazana> My 3GB RAM PC can't run a Gamecube emu at full
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz: I knew IT!
<Morty> i wish i knew about computery things like that, then maybe i could play skyrim on pc
<Ingwaz> got to be careful and clean out your NSFW pony folder from time to time otakon
<PrototypeX9000> Jesus! this game is brutal!
<Fazana> Well what were you planning on playing skyrim on? Washing machine?

<paradise92> why is that energy core alive?
<otakon> bc it is
<Fazana> A PSP is probably as powerful as a gamecube
<Mr_Popo> pokuuuuuuu
<otakon> that's how anime works, just roll with it
<Fazana> probably a tad less
<otakon> hmmm
<Fazana> 5GB might work
<Fazana> In fact, it should
<Fazana> But what Graphics card have you got?
<Sweetie_Belle> ohai
<Fazana> Is it a HD radion 1080?
<otakon> its a AMD Athlon 4200HD
<Ingwaz> hey otakon, is it just me or in Kingdoms of amalur, are the fae serious jerks
<otakon> it's low end
<otakon> Ingwaz: they seem to be jerks
<Sweetie_Belle> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<otakon> it's a 4.3 on that scale they have
<PrototypeX9000> It's me....I was the turkey all along!
<otakon> out of 7
<Ingwaz> otakon: glad its not just me
<otakon> Ingwaz: ESPECIALLY The Widow
<otakon> dat bitch
<Ingwaz> i dont remember her being more of a jerk than the majority of the fae
<Fazana> Yeah, you possibly want a better Graphics card.
<Ingwaz> then again...i killed her
<otakon> Fazana: I haz no monies.....
<Fazana> Neither do I, neither do I.
<flutter_spin> what's happenin'?
<Sundaysmile> I just got here and already I hear about murder
<Fazana> You could give it a whirl anyway
<otakon> hmmm
<Fazana> and it it doesn't work, then you can save up or something.
<flutter_spin> *looks closer* Gundam?
<otakon> I only have 255mb of dedicated graphics memory
<PrototypeX9000> hey Sundaysmile
*PC is a PC
<otakon> can I boost that?
<ScootaChicken> Hey there everypony ^_^
<Sundaysmile> hey proto
<Sundaysmile> hey scoots
<otakon> hiya ScootaChicken
<PC> ohai scootachicken
<ScootaChicken> y'know, I just realised that 'Discorded Harmony' is a really good name for a band
<Fazana> :)
<KwakLad> Hello Sundaysmile ScootaChicken and flutter_spin
<ScootaChicken> brb, finding musical bronies in England to form a band with

<PC> ohai otakon
<Fazana> I presume you can expand
<ScootaChicken> hey Fazana, you live in England right?
<Fazana> Yup
<Sundaysmile> it's tough otakon, nowadays you just have to take what you can get
<Globetrotter> Ayup everypony!
<Shotakon> >.>
<ekips> heya Globetrotter
<KwakLad> Hello Globetrotter
<Fazana> Why? :s
<Sundaysmile> hey trotter
<Globetrotter> What's this, a gundam tile game?
<ScootaChicken> Fazana: you musical in any way?
<Fazana> No, BUT my step dad is.
<Fazana> He has a small band.
<ScootaChicken> your step dad a brony?
<Fazana> Nope :/
<GLaDOS> I GOT SOME PONY TOYS.
<Fazana> I'm the only Brony in family
<Globetrotter> Sundaysmiles; trotter is so close to trots which means diarrhoea
<Fazana> But on the good side, I'm teaching myself Piano and Guitar
<GLaDOS> YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT PONY TOYS THEY ARE?!
<Sundaysmile> we call it "the shits"Globetrotter, trotter is in fact a revered name where I'm from
<PrototypeX9000> Plushie?
<otakon> um pretty?
<Globetrotter> where are you from Sundaysmile?
<GLaDOS> OKAY, IT IS -
<Sundaysmile> Britain, Scotland
<Globetrotter> I'm in England
<GLaDOS> I got Cherry Berry and GLOW IN THE DARK TWILIGHT FUCKING SPARKLE! :D
<Globetrotter> lol
<KwakLad> Trotter actually makes me think pigs feet
<Sundaysmile> Never heard of Del-Boy Trotter? :P
<Fazana> Trotter makes me thing walking horses
<flutter_spin> :( the broadcast just doesn't stay playing. hmm.
<Globetrotter> I've heard of Del-boy
<Scavender> Well they dont sell ponies here ...
<otakon> here we GO!
<otakon> GIGA
<otakon> DRILL
<Scavender> *sadface*
<Fazana> If you are on Chrome, switch to EE or FF
<otakon> BREAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
<Fazana> Miss.
<otakon> hell no
<Fazana> Okay, guess not
<Sundaysmile> massive explosiooooooooooooooooooons
<otakon> not a chance in hell
<flutter_spin> This is the first time it did this
<Midnight_Tempest> i heard you like explosions... so we put explosions in your explosions, dawg
<KwakLad> EE Fazana?
<Fazana> Internet exploer
<Fazana> Made a typo
<otakon> ScootaChicken: sorry, was only a joke! don't be angry
<KwakLad> oh okay thought so
<ScootaChicken> otakon: you disgust me.
<otakon> Aidene mech is REALLY weird looking
<PrototypeX9000> man its snowin alot where i am damn!
<Shotakon> im not usually one to complain about streams...but this game is very boring :s
<alexxm> what happened ScootaChicken
<otakon> ScootaChicken: It was only a joke man! C'mon!
<flutter_spin> my mom is repeating everything the forecaster says over the phone
<ScootaChicken> otakon: I am not Welsh.
<flutter_spin> "Snow is coming" she shouts
<NewDCD> 09,01>SRW
<NewDCD> 09,01>boring
<otakon> I joked around and almost ALMOST called him a welshman
<ScootaChicken> Never call me Welsh.
<Sundaysmile> Boob robot? Oh Japan!
<ScootaChicken> ever again.
<Globetrotter> Yes you are ScootaChicken!
<flutter_spin> Well if she says it everyday, she has to be right eventually
<NewDCD> 09,01you are clearly a hard to entertain person
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I didn't and I won't
<Midnight_Tempest> super robot wars is never boring
<Globetrotter> Welsh!
<otakon> stop it!
<Globetrotter> Weeeeeeeeeksh!
<Fazana> Robot wars is one of the best sports
<ScootaChicken> Globetrotter: Don't you dare.
<PrototypeX9000> in Japan
<otakon> Fazana: it's the national pasttime!
<PrototypeX9000> lmao
<otakon> they just don't let the rest of us know
<Globetrotter> ScootaChicken
<Scavender> Weeeee.... rather not.
<otakon> otherwise we'd want in
<flutter_spin> I wish I understood Japanese
<Morty> NewDCD: if there was some conflict in the game or an actual fight i suppose it would be fine, but its boring as hell to just watch the same repetetive cutscenes as your opponents constantly miss
<Sundaysmile> it's more fun to play if you don't
<Fazana> I would try and learn, but quite frankly, I can't be arsed
<Sundaysmile> just issue random commands
<Sundaysmile> and watch the "wtf" commence
<Fazana> If I did learn though, I would translate so many stuffs, like GK2
<Morty> its so predictable
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm sorry for being good at SRW, Morty ; 3
<otakon> Morty: you can fast forward them or skip them altogether
<Morty> im not saying the game is bad
<otakon> personally
<Midnight_Tempest> dont listen to the crazy people NewDCD, this game is fun to watch
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I like knowing the story, and I can't do that without understanding what they say
<otakon> I get a kick out of them everytime
<Morty> im saying watching someone with an invincible set up is boring
<Fazana> Right, afk for some Chinese food.
<alexxm> what u been up to ScootaChicken
<otakon> flutter_spin: try the OG1 games on the GBA
<Sundaysmile> I just noticed that boob robot has nipples...
<NewDCD> 09,01thing is, if you don't play well, you get your ass kicked to kingdom come in like two turns
<otakon> Sundaysmile: those are eye actually
<ScootaChicken> alexxm: not much, what about you?
<alexxm> not much either
<Sundaysmile> makes sense....?
<PrototypeX9000> i used to play Field Commander on my old PSP that was fun for a while...
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I will never again joke that you are Welsh. I hereby swear on this IRC with witness'.
<Morty> i wonder what will happen next? same cutscene ive been watching for hours followed by an enmy miss?
<Morty> lets find out
<alexxm> so what ScootaChicken what was going on a few minutes ago
<flutter_spin> I barely have the patience for tile-based games
<Globetrotter> ScootaChicken is so much more awesome than welsh
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Good.
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken I swear you're irish.
<otakon> okay good, now I'll brb I need my food
<Midnight_Tempest> Morty: if you dont like it, you can always turn off the screen... some of us like this and dont appreciate the complaining...
<otakon> um did Eureka just go super Kawaii?
<otakon> that's not a big gun
<flutter_spin> whoa
<alexxm> of course it would be critical
<PrototypeX9000> robot lady gonna get ass slammed
<Scavender> Hey why is the gun guy always shooting each others crotches ??
<otakon> THIS is a big gun http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~kkc273/PinkiePieHiRes.png
<Morty> sorry, its just gotten really repetetive
<flutter_spin> I saw that comin'
<Morty> ill stop
<otakon> huh huh?
<Sundaysmile> Partee Cannoru!
<flutter_spin> I guess I can go watch the latest episodes of Alcatraz
<otakon> flutter_spin: have fun come back soon
<PrototypeX9000> Big O?
<Sundaysmile> looks like it
<otakon> PrototypeX9000: BIG O
<Midnight_Tempest> Big O... <3
<otakon> yes
<alexxm> i'm probably heading out now see u guys later
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<otakon> and SURE PROMISE FTW!
<Sundaysmile> It is him
<Scavender> Bye alex
<PrototypeX9000> cya alexxm
<KwakLad> bye alexxm
<PrototypeX9000> such class...
<otakon> cya later alexxm come back soon!
<PrototypeX9000> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> still needs Big Duo...
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: was a boss in the first game
<KwakLad> is that the one somepony called boob bot?
<Sundaysmile> Big O levelled up!"
<otakon> no
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< bring it back then
<otakon> Roger did
<otakon> the mechs don't level up
<otakon> but the pilots stats effect the mech
<PrototypeX9000> anypony know how SUpreme COmmander 2 is?
<Sundaysmile> they should...
<otakon> by percentage
<otakon> YOU CAN however ugrade a mechs stats
<otakon> with money
<Midnight_Tempest> supreme commander 2 is ok... not as good as the first one
<otakon> along with their weapons too
<PrototypeX9000> i couldn t find a demo for the firstone on xbox
<otakon> but no, Pilots level up
<KwakLad> PrototypeX9000 apparently its not balanced very well
<PrototypeX9000> its not? How?
<otakon> KwakLad: it's perfectly balanced
<otakon> oh wait hold on wrong game
<otakon> nvm that comment
<PrototypeX9000> lol
<otakon> I was talking about SRT not Supreme Commander
<otakon> okay brb
<Midnight_Tempest> Supreme Commander 2 was made to get people into that style of game... it's super easy but really well balanced, the MP is suprisingly good
<KwakLad> PrototypeX9000 one of the forces is overpowerd i think, i never got specifics i was just told it wasnt balanced greatly
<unfoundbug> Hiya guys
<PrototypeX9000> oh ok
<Scavender> Hello
<Sundaysmile> almost sounds like mlp music there
<Red_Pegasus> Hi everypony.
<unfoundbug> What game had an unbalanced side?
<Scavender> Hi
<unfoundbug> hiya Red_Pegasus
<KwakLad> PrototypeX9000 i guess i heard wrong acording to midnight
<Red_Pegasus> Anime?
<otakon> hiya Red_Pegasus
<otakon> Red_Pegasus: SUPER ROBOT WARS!
<Scavender> Actually a game
<Sundaysmile> we just defeated the boob robot of doom
<PrototypeX9000> its kinda reminding me of Total Annihilation, if ya dont know what it is its an old 90s pc game
<Sundaysmile> it was glorious
<Red_Pegasus> Isn't that the cartoon in Japan that caused spazms?
<otakon> Sundaysmile: that wasbn't the boob robot
<otakon> Red_Pegasus: no, that's Pokemon
<Midnight_Tempest> all cartoons in japan cause seizures...
<otakon> ahem
<Morty> japanese people are just weak to seizures
<otakon> all cartoons MADE in japan
<Morty> its super effective against them
<otakon> cause seizures
<otakon> not in
<otakon> bc you know they air american and other stuff their too you know
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: i know what i meant... dont make me glare at you through the internet
<Red_Pegasus> Who is streaming?
<Sundaysmile> well.... the west edits animes for western audiences
<Morty> im sure im not the only one here who watched the porygon episode and didnt get a seizure
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm streaman
*otakon glares at Midnight_Tempest through the internet
<Sundaysmile> japanese must edit western content for seizures
<otakon> lol
<otakon> :D
<Red_Pegasus> NewDCD: How can you understand the japanse?
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
*otakon puts out Midnight_Tempest AGAIN
<otakon> stop doing that!
<PrototypeX9000> will you stop lol
<Morty> -_-
<Morty> 10 damage
<Midnight_Tempest> that was your fault otakon...
<otakon> whats up Morty?
<otakon> my glaring?
<otakon> sorry
<Morty> huh?
<Red_Pegasus> The girl sounds like Fluttershy.
<NewDCD> 09,01by playing the translated games in this series + this: http://akurasu.net/wiki/Super_Robot_Wars/Z2
<Sundaysmile> she sounds stoned...
<otakon> Red_Pegasus: she basically IS Fluttershy
<otakon> that's Princess Nia
<Midnight_Tempest> nah, Morty is just tired of seeing the same cutscenes over and over... it is an RPG...
<otakon> "daughter" of Lord Genome
<otakon> from Gurren Lagann
<Morty> the cutscenes are cool
<NewDCD> 09,01think I'm gonna switch to the Masoukishin SRW after this
<Morty> this has been on for hours though
<NewDCD> 09,01God knows I'm getting my ass kicked there
<PrototypeX9000> Supreme Commander 1 and 2 are just remakes of Total Annihilation it looks like
<GLaDOS> MEOW
<NewDCD> 09,01and it's still the same stage <3
<Midnight_Tempest> :F
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Scavender> Yay boobies
<ScootaChicken> oh DashWithRainbows
<ScootaChicken> you silly filly
<Sundaysmile> jiggly
<DashWithRainbows> That was a fast reaction ScootaChicken.
<Morty> yoko, the original "when im" video
<ScootaChicken> I got there in the end, didn't I.
<DashWithRainbows> True.

<The_4th_Wall> At least she's never RedRinged on me
<Midnight_Tempest> yet
*The_4th_Wall does not have orange box :(
<The_4th_Wall> it's official
<DashWithRainbows> The_4th_Wall I get red ring everytime i turn mine on. Still capable of getting it to work like normal. Had this problem for over a year and a half.
<Sundaysmile> and he died
<The_4th_Wall> If my xbox Red Rings, Midnight_Tempest is to blame
<DashWithRainbows> Or me.
<PrototypeX9000> Xbox elite and kinect xbox no longer get red rings if ya did nt know
<Morty> can we finish fmab after this?
<Sundaysmile> The curse is in effect, nothing can stop it now
<otakon> I've gone through 5 xboxes due to E 34 and RRoD
<The_4th_Wall> They do.
<otakon> but this one is FINE
<otakon> bc it IS
<The_4th_Wall> Tehy just don't have red LED's
<otakon> and I have a warranty
<NewDCD> 09,01otakon: I hope you didn't have to BUY those 5 XBoxes
<Red_Pegasus> This looks like a TV show.
<The_4th_Wall> E34?
<DashWithRainbows> As soon as my xbox decides to go into full "Fuck you mode", i'm getting a gaming PC.
<PrototypeX9000> my xbox never messed up on me and i had mine for 2 years now
<The_4th_Wall> wazzat?
<Fazana> I'm back
<Jim> Welcome back Fazana
<otakon> NewDCD: i had to buy some of them, but I got warranties on the rest
<otakon> MOKU!!!
<DashWithRainbows> The_4th_Wall Rule 34 of the E3 event?
<Red_Pegasus> Mug you!
<otakon> no
<otakon> it was a error
<otakon> that REPLACED the RRoD in the "newer" models that came out after launch
<The_4th_Wall> DarkBlacky...
<otakon> it was the NEW RRoD
<otakon> The_4th_Wall: don't you mean Black Snooty?
<The_4th_Wall> I know that GT from somewhere
<Cypresswolf> wow :) I was wondering why so few are in the stream, then I noticed 2 chat tabs are open

<otakon> too bad he's not hotblooded
<Kammerjunk> I'm all for TF2.
<The_4th_Wall> ALL HAIL LELOUCH!
<NewDCD> 09,01Lelouch mourned Kamina in this game
<Kammerjunk> This film has gotten boring, anyway.
<NewDCD> 09,01he actually got to like him
<otakon> NewDCD: WHAT!?
<otakon> ;__;
<otakon> and here I thought Kamina survived
<NewDCD> 09,01not as hard as the rest of the cast
<otakon> ;__;
<NewDCD> 09,01but Lelouch and Kamina butted heads a bit and then Lelouch saw him as an irreplaceable person

<Fazana> The quality is really really good
<Fazana> not just the graphics
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: they are both turn based strategy games
<Lasharus> :(
<DashWithRainbows> True.
<The_4th_Wall> Music sounds like older FF

<NewDCD> 09,01it's Jaohm
<otakon> hmmm?
<NewDCD> 09,01Mazaki's Elemental Lord before he gets Cybuster
<PrototypeX9000> hmmm...Civilization Revolution or Dead Rising 2?
<otakon> oh
<paradise92> Dead Rising 2
<DashWithRainbows> DR2

<otakon> NewDCD: it gets blown to hell doesn't it
<Scavender> @<Lasharus> It is, just refreshed and stream is playing fine for me.
<PrototypeX9000> lol
<DashWithRainbows> It is pretty good.
<PrototypeX9000> ok
<otakon> NO!
<NewDCD> 09,01Jaohm, The Elemental Lord of Shimmering Heat
<otakon> CIVR!
<NewDCD> 09,01dunno cause later another character inherits Jaohm
<PrototypeX9000> y?
<Fazana> DR2 is really really repetitive
<otakon> NewDCD: thanks
<Red_Pegasus> NewDCD: Guess you can say, he is hot. YYYYEAH
<otakon> ofc the old man is a lecher
<Fazana> All you do is wait, kill zombies, rescue noobs
<The_4th_Wall> How to delete Skype account
<DashWithRainbows> Fazana but kills time and is best with a friend.
<The_4th_Wall> ?
<NewDCD> 09,01funny you say that, considering Masaki is a babe magnet
<NewDCD> 09,01COUGHRYUUNECOUGH
<Fazana> I prefer L4D IMO
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<NewDCD> 09,01oh yeah otakon
<NewDCD> 09,01Valsione is in this
<DashWithRainbows> Because that series is sexy as hell Fazana.
<otakon> NewDCD: you mean Lune correct? Miss Flapper Girl herself
<PrototypeX9000> imma probably get tht soon
<otakon> NewDCD: SWEET!
<NewDCD> 09,01so DCD can go full RYUUSEI
<Fazana> L4D 1 is better in some respects
<Fazana> But L4D 2 is also better in some too
<DashWithRainbows> I prefer L4D2.
<Fazana> It really is a pickle which one to get
<otakon> NewDCD: so Ryuusei has a thing for Super Robots shaped like women huh?
<The_4th_Wall> Anyone here see my ponyville helicopter last night?
<NewDCD> 09,01dunno what respects L4D1 is better than 2, aside from some custom campaigns
<otakon> now that is an off fetish tbh
<GLaDOS> woo
<GLaDOS> :D
<otakon> it's the potato again
<DashWithRainbows> easy Fazana, L4D1 for those new to L4D and L4D2 when they complete it.
<Fazana> L4D has got a few small things that are better
<GLaDOS> I am NOT a potato.
<Fazana> But the main thing is it's scarier
<GLaDOS> I got changed back.
<GLaDOS> Duuuuh.
<otakon> GLaDOS: no you didn't
<NewDCD> 09,01I was thinking of drawing Ryuusei giving a love letter to a human-sized Valsione, both of them in school uniforms, and Valsione looking bashful
<NewDCD> 09,01because HILAROUS
<PrototypeX9000> always dark...
<GLaDOS> Mhmm.
*otakon wills GLaDOS to be a potato again
<PrototypeX9000> but hordes are small as hell

<PrototypeX9000> night scavender
<DashWithRainbows> Night Scavender
<GLaDOS> I shall NOT turn myself into a POTATO.
<otakon> NewDCD: no realy I think the only way it could be better if he's handing to Valsione when it's regular sized
<PrototypeX9000> imma make me a couple hot dogs
<Red_Pegasus> GLaDOS: You are a potato already!
<PrototypeX9000> brb
<GLaDOS> I'm not.
<otakon> GLaDOS: no, I TURNED you into a potato
<Lasharus> Nope, looks like either my system refuses to acknowledge Veemi's existence, or something's wrong on their end.
<NewDCD> 09,01...I'll draw that as well
<GLaDOS> fuck
*otakon pokes the potato GLaDOS "Wub damn you"

<Sumica> 00,10any idea why GLaDOS? Or what's it saying to you.
<paradise92> :(
<GLaDOS> Sumiva: It says 'This webpage is not availableThe server at www.veemi.com can't be found, because the DNS lookup failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website's name to its Internet address. This error is most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing Google Chrome from accessing the net
<GLaDOS> and that's what it says.
<Shizuka> 13huh
<CCCP> text wall
<Sumica> 00,10any clues Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13no i mean firefox is failing to find veemi.com

<Fazana> otakon: Baka
<RAWRity> otakon: no, but she was in incredible pain and had no way to be turned back. it was either kill her quickly, or keep her alive and allow that little girl and her beloved dog to waste away in pain and fatigue for possibly years, if she didn't just starve herself like her mother did.

<Syndicate> Fluttershy, my favorite
<Kammerjunk> You should totally go out with her.
<Syndicate> Pinkie pie, my second
<Kammerjunk> If she's drawing ponies for you, she obviously can't hate you.
<Syndicate> And vinyl scratch.
<Wrek> 05if she's a brony, then its taboo not to try
<ScienceLawnchair> Ponkey Poe

<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek is right.
<Dashie_Dashie> DO EET
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<Fazana> It keeps having to buffer every 15 sec
<RaveBrony> What is this persons name? :P
<otakon> Syndicate: you like her right? you enjoy being in her company and such? THEN DO EEETTTT FILLY!
<Syndicate> She is indeed a pegasister
<Fazana> and it's skipping frames
<otakon> Fazana: not for me!
*otakon does hthe happy dance of lag freeness
<paradise92> a black man speaking japanese :D
<Fazana> I'll switch to Chrome soon
<RAWRity> So...Tom Cruise is possibly a brony. Thoughts?
<Globetrotter> Syndicate you silly filly, go go go go!

<Darf14> OH its him, I remember him
<Kammerjunk> Pay them all your money if you have to.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, LordCelestia.

<flutter_spin> woot. I'm back!
<Jim> Welcome back flutter_spin
<flutter_spin> to... nothing? aw
<GLaDOS> :D:D:D
<GLaDOS> D:
<flutter_spin> Sry. I had to watch the Bronies react to Teenagers React video
<String_Shredder> or maybe... CaROLINE
<flutter_spin> that was hilarious
<otakon> flutter_spin: theres one of those?
<Globetrotter> Yup
<flutter_spin> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/bronies-react-to-teens-react-to-my.html
<Jim> flutter_spin: That one is hilarious
<Globetrotter> flutter_spin I'm not a man? *evil stare*
<flutter_spin> I can't believe I had to watch it about 3 or 4 times over before I started to piece things together
<flutter_spin> I never met any of these guys or had a passion to Inception
<flutter_spin> Had to go through their stuff. No wonder the one guy sounded familiar. He did "Love Me Cheerilee"
<Jim> Yeah, those guys in that video are quite well known
<otakon> flutter_spin: who the HELL is Dusty?
<Jim> The manliest brony ever
<otakon> and why is he maniler than I?
<Fazana> The guy with the serious moustache
<otakon> damn it
<otakon> NO!
<RAWRity> I really don't get why Winry continues to wear a skirty that could barely function as a belt.
<The_4th_Wall> http://gd666.tumblr.com/
<otakon> I SHALL NOT BE BEATTEN
<RAWRity> *skirt
<flutter_spin> Yeah. Dusty sort of threw out the "I am the manliest man ever and I like MLP"
<Fazana> Because Japanese. DUH
<The_4th_Wall> This is Equestria's aircraft hangar
<otakon> RAWRity: you haven't seen her strip of cloth bra/workwear have you?
<Jim> *Enter otakon's beard training montage*
<Fazana> Dusty is wrong though
<Fazana> The manliest man ever is Armstrong
<otakon> and he saw Ross'
<RAWRity> otakon: at least that one sort of makes sense. You're working with machnery, oil, all that stuff YOu want something that isn't gonna be in the way.
<flutter_spin> Well, he is our representation of "you can be a man and like MLP"
<otakon> RAWRity: but not overalls like ANY OTHER MECHANIC?
<Jim> You best start doing beard pushups
<RAWRity> otakon: we don't see any other using it.
<flutter_spin> Its kind of odd to see someone step up and say "I'm proud to be a brony" out in the open like that
<RAWRity> *those
<otakon> RAWRity: we don't see any other young female automail workers either?
<otakon> WAT!?

<Fazana> "little"
<Fazana> It's pretty bad for me.
<Fazana> I'm missing half the subs
<flutter_spin> Yeah. My connection hasn't been the strongest today. Seems like it won't load.
<Globetrotter> Fazana, that's what little means right? shitton of lag
<otakon> brb

<tgl1992> Hey guys, just got on. So is the stream down?
<otakon> and that's way I don't like the military
<flutter_spin> Why does this remind me of Star Trek? What it means to be a soldier.

<Fazana> This is normal in their terms
<Fazana> Serioisly

<Fazana> Now, I require fuel, as I am down to 50 mls, so BRb

<Fazana> Fueld up
<Fazana> Back to 1.5 litres

<CriticKitten> I'm gonna end up eating the whole darn container if I don't stop.
<paradise92> just skip till he starts to "transform" into ssj2 sry i needed to come back
<paradise92> to post this :S
<flutter_spin> lol
<Flutterpop> big mac is awesome
<CriticKitten> I swear, Pringles are laced with some addictive substance. Probably drugs.
<ScienceLawnchair> I want drugs! Now!
<Flutterpop> interesting
<Jim> Pringles ARE drugs
<flutter_spin> lol
<Globetrotter> Druggles?
<CriticKitten> YAY. It's time for the fun. :D
<Flutterpop> SAYS WHO"
<KwakLad> People are drugs
<Fazana> Pringles contain acid
<Jim> because they are so addictive, and it hurts you when your hand gets stuck in the container
<CriticKitten> Go doggy!
<The_4th_Wall> 1920x1080p display...
<flutter_spin> ....uh, run?
<RAWRity> Oh no puppy! don't die!
<Flutterpop> Pinkie pie is a gypsy
<flutter_spin> O.o
<Fazana> Fatty cam't firt throughthe window
<CriticKitten> BOOM
<Kammerjunk> Did you ponies see the Heart's Desire comic?
<CriticKitten> :D
<Flutterpop> NO
<Jim> Don't think so
<flutter_spin> For someone to not know anything about the series, that came out of nowhere
<RAWRity> BURN HIM TO A CRISP. THEN EAT HIM.
<Yahooz> watabitch
<Kammerjunk> It's around the front page of EQD.
<Conyst> It's pretty good
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: what came out of nowhere?
<CriticKitten> Dat doggy. Obeying orders.
<CriticKitten> XD
<flutter_spin> The whole hand = boomboom
<CriticKitten> Roy is the man with the boomstick-for-a-hand. :o
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: his gloves have a special symbol drawn on them that allows for the use of flame alchemy.
<Sumica> 00,10the flame alchmist
<flutter_spin> I could ask questions all day like what is the deal with the giant metal man, but whatever
<Conyst> and there made of a special cloth
<flutter_spin> I'm going with it. Just like Pink Floyd
<Sumica> 00,10the gloves alow the creeation of a spark, and the circle alows him to controll it.
<KwakLad> "i guess thats hard to believe" no responce except for gun being loaded
<CriticKitten> And IIRC, the gloves are slightly different, one allowing for big boom and the other is more controlled for pinpoint targeting
<CriticKitten> Though that's not always kept to...
<flutter_spin> Yu Yu Hakusho was weird like that too.
<Sumica> 00,10dat music
<RaveBrony> ^
<Fazana> It reminds me of godzilla
<CriticKitten> NO! Never split the party!
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: essentially, there was an accident that ended up with Al's body being lost entirely, and his brother sacrificed his arm to graft Al's soul onto that armor.
<CriticKitten> Haven't you played D&D, Roy?
<CriticKitten> D:<
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi lust
<flutter_spin> ohhhhhh
<RaveBrony> :o
<RAWRity> Barry (one with the ax) was part of a government experiment that essentially did the same thing.
<flutter_spin> lol
<CriticKitten> Boing~
<Jim> dat zoom
<RaveBrony> :D
<flutter_spin> I see the cartoon side of things
<Flutterpop> chicken

<CriticKitten> Love that scene.
<Wrek> 05i feel his pain
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Flutterpop> Fluttershy x Big mac forever
<flutter_spin> oh!
<Fazana> Lol
<flutter_spin> Things just get more freaky, don't they?
<Conyst> stabbity hands
<CriticKitten> Yeah, clearly the guns are going to work if your flames couldn't kill the other guy
<Darf14> Curse you regenerating health bar
<CriticKitten> >_>
<RAWRity> Shoot her in the boobs! They're the source of her power!
<RaveBrony> ._.
<flutter_spin> ^^
<CriticKitten> It's funny cuz it's true
<RAWRity> her cleavage gives her strength!
<RaveBrony> those faces :D
<Jim> Witch!
<Fazana> You'll get sufficated to death...by the cleavage
<CriticKitten> Dat BOOM
<Conyst> Curse you water, my mortal enemy
<flutter_spin> I have no idea what just happened
<flutter_spin> More explosions please.
<Sumica> 00,10big boom
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> idleing on tf2 and watching stream.
<KwakLad> Good to hear happy continuity announcers
<RaveBrony> :D
<CriticKitten> flutter: He broke the water down into Hydrogen and Oxygen gas, which made it flammable. Explosively so.
<Jim> baddass scar
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> doesn't get any better.
<Jim> Dashie_Dashie|TF2: I'm doing the exact same thing ^^
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: alchmy allows them to change chemical compositions. They separated the Hyrdogen and Oxygen in the water to make for a highly explosive atmosphere
<CriticKitten> And down he goes~
<RaveBrony> dat fail alert
<Flutterpop> YO
<RAWRity> HAVOC! NO!
<RaveBrony> O.O
<KwakLad> No Havoc? damn means C&C Renegade will never exist now

<Rainbow> Hi everypony! -whisper-
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: which do you prefer, Brotherhood, or the first Anime
<RAWRity> ?

<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> !cd
<Tom> Episode 18 of season 2 "A Friend in Deed" airs in 1 days, 16 hours, 49 minutes, 53 seconds (Feb 18 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
<The_4th_Wall> SIEG HEIL
<CriticKitten> Definitely Brotherhood. It just executes everything better
<Derpyfall> hi
<DubZbrony> I like bleach´ better than this one :O...or Ghost in the shell Ftw!
<RAWRity> Al just realized, HE COULD RUST!
<flutter_spin> Ghost in the Shell I've watched. Bleach I have watched a few episodes.
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> Al should have daedric not iron.
<Dashie_Dashie|TF2> n00b
<CriticKitten> flutter: Don't worry, I won't, just saying that it gets better still
<Derpyfall> hi
<DubZbrony> Hes like TinMan From Wizard of Oz
<Derpyfall> apples
<RAWRity> Bleh, FMA is much better than Bleach. For one thing, FMA actually has an ending.
<flutter_spin> O.o
<Fazana> NOOO
<Fazana> Barry!
<RaveBrony> owned?
<DubZbrony> Doesnt need an ending, just have to be good waste of time
<flutter_spin> Bleach came on much later in the evening. I couldn't stay up to watch it.
<RAWRity> second, the supporting character in FMA actually DO SOMETHING rather than just sit there to cheer on Ed.
<RaveBrony> ^
<Rainbow> Fucking headshot.
<CriticKitten> Dat rage
<RaveBrony> O_o
<flutter_spin> More guns!

<CriticKitten> Roy gets the best fights, too. XD
<flutter_spin> more fluttershy
<Gumri> Erm what Episode of MLP is the best?
<Fazana> I don't know, but when I do quotations, I always spell them badly. :o
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: you think THAT ending was extreme? WAIT UNTIL THE FINALE.
<Morty> Roy makes his fights the best fights
<flutter_spin> Season 2 Episode 2
<KwakLad> Hello Gumri
*The_4th_Wall gets in the shower to wash hischest
<CriticKitten> Oh god the finale
<Morty> this ending is best ending
<flutter_spin> that wasn't the finale?
<CriticKitten> That was so absurd and so awesome
<Gumri> Really? That is a 2 parter.
<flutter_spin> OH MY WORD THERES MORE
<RAWRity> a finale that is TEN EPISODES LONG
<DubZbrony> Why do they Make Sing´along songs out of Everything they can get their Hooves on!
<Dark_Horst> did i miss a lot since yesterday? i have no idea what's going on
<CriticKitten> The finale of Brotherhood kicks so much ass. XD
<Gumri> well imma go watch this. Goodbye
<Morty> Brotherhood finale is the sex
<flutter_spin> Maybe I should start from the beginning and watch the whole thing
<ekips> I never fully understood the finale Oo
<flutter_spin> I hate being thrown in the middle like this
<The_4th_Wall> KELP
<Apokalipse> So do I.
<Fazana> Wow, episode 20 already
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: that'd be a good idea. Or, if you want, read the manga
<Morty> ekips are you sure you are thinking of the brotherhood finale?
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, is missed about 4 eps, no wonder i'm confused
<flutter_spin> I don't like the read :( I'm not a comic person
<Dark_Horst> ....i also missed everything before that
<Fazana> Oh!
<Fazana> Is it in Manga? :o
<Flutterpop> ROAR
<RAWRity> Fazana: eeyup. Fullmetal Alchemist
<Fazana> Y U NO TELL ME!
<Morty> Brotherhood finale makes sense, crappy other one ending makes no sense at all
<CriticKitten> It's worth watching, flutter. The series is really a very good one. It's one anime I recommend to everyone, even if they don't generally watch anime, if only because it's a show that most anyone can enjoy.
<ekips> yeah I guess, but it's been a while, maybe I am mixing with the normal
<paradise92> damn this show is going fast :S
<flutter_spin> So what, watch all whatever 30 episodes of Brotherhood?
<flutter_spin> What about the original series?
<paradise92> 64
<Fazana> This is really funny, full of action, no filler, the perfect show.
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: 63
<CriticKitten> There's more than 30. I think there's....yeah, 60-some
<DubZbrony> Like who sings along on this :S....i cant even understand a Word there saying
<Fazana> 64 exactly
<paradise92> flutter_spin this is the original...this one sticks to the manga
<RAWRity> 10 of those episodes are JUST THE FINALE
<CriticKitten> Brotherhood finale is best finale.
<Flutterpop> I LIKE CHICKEN I LIKE LIVER MEOW MIX MEOW MIX PLEASE DELIVER!!!
<ekips> he's got the shiny glasses

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi hi~ tgl1992
<Flutterpop> BRO HOOF
<DubZbrony> Can anyone tell my Why Fluttershy was Blushing when Ranbow dash Tore her Blanket off in the Cider Episode :S...never really got that?
<flutter_spin> well at least they are explaining things really well to me.
<tgl1992> fan service
<tgl1992> *cough*
<String_Shredder> dat short skirt...
<CriticKitten> Dun goofed, Ling
<RAWRity> DubZbrony: as a joke.
<Flutterpop> ponies don't wear clothes
<flutter_spin> fan service. She is technically naked.
<RAWRity> String_Shredder: and yet we never get a panty shot. Brotherhood keeps it classy.
<The_4th_Wall> We don't normally wear clothes...
<Rainbow> Back
<DubZbrony> Rofl...so the memes where right :P
<flutter_spin> I didn't get it at first until I watched it with the stream when everyone shouted it out
<Flutterpop> Who hear memeroized every song in the series so far
<Morty> me
<Dark_Horst> what's this brotherhood i hear so much talking about?
<CriticKitten> Flutterpop: Better question is who doesn't?
<Flutterpop> SO TRUE
<flutter_spin> FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
<Dark_Horst> i see
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: the show we're watching. It's called Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
<CriticKitten> The music in this series is pretty perfect for each scene it occurs in.
<paradise92> NIIIINAAAAAA
<paradise92> NIIIINAAAAAAAA
<ekips> ;_;
<Fazana> Nina ',..,'
<Morty> Nina ;0;
<flutter_spin> Is it safe to be freaked out right now?
<CriticKitten> Part of why I love the series so much. Everything fits together so nicely. I wish more American shows could manage this sort of quality.
<RAWRity> IIRC, nina's fate was brought up more times than Digimon Tamers flashed back to Leomon's death.
<Flutterpop> CriticKitten: BUT HAVE YOU MEMORIZED THE PERFECT STALLION son
<Jim> Well, I'm off for tonight, bye everyone
<RAWRity> bye Jim
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night jim
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Jim.
<Rainbow> ...
<Rainbow> It's basically morning
<CriticKitten> ....Nina. ;_;
<Flutterpop> wuh
<Dark_Horst> how come the ones with german names are always the bad/elusive guys in anime?
<The_4th_Wall> It's morning somewhere
<RAWRity> once this show is over, we need to show the Dub outtakes.
<ekips> Dark_Horst prejudices
<flutter_spin> let me guess, more explosion time?
<Morty> Hoenheim isnt bad
<paradise92> actually
<CriticKitten> Nina's sad, though Hughes' death always brings me to tears.
<paradise92> if we can
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: well, to be fare, Elric is a fairly german name.
<ekips> and what morty said
<Fazana> He;s just a bastard
<Flutterpop> Big mac stares upon u
<paradise92> can we get Fairy Tail on this streams?
<Flutterpop> Don't deny it
<paradise92> on these*
<Dark_Horst> elric? wut?
<Morty> Hoenheim isn't a bastard either
<Flutterpop> OR ELSE
<RAWRity> paradise92: fuck no. Fairy Tail can eat me.
<Rainbow> This stream needs something
<Rainbow> ..
<Rainbow> More ponies!
<Morty> hoenheim is a hero period
<Flutterpop> Ponies
<flutter_spin> when it rains, it pours
<String_Shredder> more cowbell

<tgl1992> Rainbow you will get ponies tomorrow and saturday :3

<Flutterpop> Ponyception
<CriticKitten> Poor Ed.
<Flutterpop> Ponyception
<The_4th_Wall> HUZZAH
<Flutterpop> is
<CriticKitten> He and Al suffer so much in this show. :(
<Flutterpop> awesome
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies are tomorrow, and I won't be there :(.
<paradise92> RAWRity...rlly? are you for real??? fairy tail will continue after bleach and naruto are over...it is because naruto and bleach will soon be over...
<Fazana> Why does he sound like he's regurgitating?
<paradise92> RAWRity start watching new anime dude
<Flutterpop> {\\\]]
<RAWRity> paradise92: I DO watch new anime. And Fairy Tail sucks ass.
<Flutterpop> Bronys are epic
<Rainbow> In soviet russia anime watches you
<CriticKitten> ....
<Flutterpop> Big mac would certainly agree
<flutter_spin> Only new anime I've watched is Persona 4
<Darf14> the dead body was a lie
<Fazana> No way
<Fazana> I bet she's still alive!
<CriticKitten> That's horrifying.
<RAWRity> Bleach jumped the shark 3 years ago in the manga, Naruto has been hit and miss at best for the better part of a decade.
<DubZbrony> Anyone Got some cider -_-
<Morty> Fazana...she's not
<Rainbow> Cider?
<Sumica> 00,10that's right, you mom was a dude
<Rainbow> I have some
<Rainbow> hands it out-
<Fazana> My mum is a spy
<Rainbow> -pours it out before you get it-
<Rainbow> '_'
<The_4th_Wall> LOL
<DubZbrony> Argh ^^, thanks, much better nauw
<RAWRity> hell, telling me to watch new anime, THIS anime we're watching right now isn't even 3 years old.
<CriticKitten> Inorite
<flutter_spin> YOU SAID THAT
<paradise92> RAWRity but it finished...
<Morty> why does that not being his mom mean anything? What does it mean? anyone?
<Flutterpop> YO
<Flutterpop> BRONY STATE}
<flutter_spin> Wait, this isn't 3 years... but people have talked about it when I was a teenager
<KwakLad> hello Flutterpop
*The_4th_Wall gets in the shower to wash his chest and feet
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: there was another anime back in the early 2000s
<Sumica> 00,10there has been 2 animes caled FMA flutter_spin
<flutter_spin> Yeah, the original, right?
<Conyst> Brotherhood is three years old.
<RAWRity> but the manga wasn't finished at the time, so they branched off from it half-way throuhg the story.
<Hodiku> the original had an... odd ending
<Sumica> 00,10brotherehood is based more on the manga
<Morty> what episode is this?
<CriticKitten> Brotherhood's definitely the better one IMO.
<flutter_spin> So the older one is "odd" but the newer one is a remix/remake and is better?
<Sumica> 00,10oh look eqd already issueing a retraction
<SlurryMoon> 3lol EqD fail x3
<Conyst> odd is an understatement
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Thank godness
<tgl1992> lol @ EQD
<Morty> what episode is this?
<Morty> Sumica
<Conyst> especially that movie
<Darf14> I guess hes not one.....oh well
<CriticKitten> flutter: Yes
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: Brotherhood being better is a bit dependent on your tastes. it's more accurate to say taht Brotherhood is just very faithful to the manga.
<Sumica> 00,10Morty
<CriticKitten> The original FMA got ahead of its manga source material, so it made stuff up.
<Morty> what episode is this Sumica?
<ekips> he gets mad just as winry
<flutter_spin> Ohhhh. See I don't care about the manga.
<CriticKitten> Brotherhood was made near the end of the manga's run and follows it faithfully.
<Sumica> 00,10it's um.....20 I think
<Fazana> HAH
<Everlasting_Joy> Boot to the head.
<flutter_spin> But Brotherhood is the recommended version of the two, eh? They both tell identical stories?
<CriticKitten> Mostly.
<tgl1992> flutter_spin: I love brotherhood than the original crap
<Morty> NO
<Morty> not at all!
<Darf14> its a little different than the origional from what I can tell
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: no. about a third of the way through, the stories branch off into completely different stories.
<CriticKitten> Like I said, the old FMA didn't follow the manga because it got ahead of the series.
<Sumica> 00,10they are close till around ep14
<RAWRity> Darf14: it's a LOT differnt.
<CriticKitten> So it started making stuff up
<CriticKitten> And....didn't do a good job of it.
<Darf14> your right, its a lot not a little
<Sumica> 00,10then brotherhodd goes above and beyond
<RAWRity> Whether Brotherhood or the Original is better is a matter of taste.
<Morty> its totally different Flutter_spin. People that say otherwise are on very powerful drugs
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Darf14> I grew up with the origional so by default I prefer the origional
<CriticKitten> Ed was friend-zone'd due to height....sad. :(
<Sumica> 00,10I watched the orginal first as well, this is better in my book.
<flutter_spin> Kind of reminds me of the OVA version of Ah My Goddess and the series. Or even Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: well technically, it's Winry's fault he's short.
<DubZbrony> Dat Dupstep /)oO(\ Keeps me awake, dat and Too much Coffee
<Syndicate> Anypony want to play TF2 in a bit?
<CriticKitten> Yeah, that's true.
<CriticKitten> She did a poor job with the automail IIRC.
<tgl1992> How did the original end? I remember it being something like Ed being in a train in the 40's type europe or something
<Morty> The "Original" is bullshit made up by people who started following the creator's story then they caught up to where the author was and made up their own terrible shit
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it's because the automail is so heavy, it stunted his growth.
<Conyst> I prefer Brotherhood even with seeing the original three times.
<DubZbrony> naw play Bf3 instead :P
<CriticKitten> Ah, right.
<Fazana> No
<Fazana> It's because he HATES milk
<Morty> Brotherhood is the true original because it follows the real story
<Fazana> I can clarify it.
<CriticKitten> It's been a while so I couldn't remember all the details.
<flutter_spin> sry. automail = derpy. I have no idea what you are talking about.
<Fazana> I hate milk
<RAWRity> Morty: I certainly wouldn't call it terrible. It's a lot more out there, but it can stand on its own.
<Fazana> I'm short.
<Sumica> 00,10Full metal pony: Bronyhood.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica if only.
<RainbowJack> hello everypony
<flutter_spin> What was that one series I watched. The samurai with the glasses.
<RainbowJack> Wrek?
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey RainbowJack.
<Morty> RAWRity: I guess you are right. Its just terrible compared to Brotherhood and its finale was just bad
<CriticKitten> flutter: Samurai Champloo?
<Fazana> Samurai Jack?
<flutter_spin> yes. thats it
<flutter_spin> Champloo
<Fazana> That was good
<CriticKitten> Though, there's a few with samurai-with-glasses, that's just one of the better known ones. :p
<RainbowJack> is wrek here?
<Syndicate> Fazana...I love you for that.
<Syndicate> Samurai Jack xD
<PhrozenFire> What is up my bronies ?
<Fazana> The ceiling
<Syndicate> O shit...
<Conyst> the sky
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek is probably lurking
<RaveBrony> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lurking is fun
<Syndicate> Let's ping the ever-loving heck out of him.
<CriticKitten> Last I saw he was watching the show with us. :p
<Morty> Wrek is in my house
<Everlasting_Joy> Lurking is fun indeed.
<paradise92> BIg man...small women...how did she putted that huge...umm..."sword"...inside her?
<Syndicate> Wrek

*Syndicate looks for Wrek.
<PhrozenFire> ... Let me rephrase so the smart a**'s don't do anything... What is going on with the quite humnble situation in this nice chat, my bronies?
<ekips> wrek should lurk more
<Syndicate> The ceiling.
<Everlasting_Joy> BTW I am liking we are watching this with subs.
<Morty> indeed the ceiling
<flutter_spin> We are watching FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as we compare it to the original anime
<Syndicate> We were literally talking about the ceiling.
<CriticKitten> Dat inspirational music~
<Sumica> 00,10Subs is the only version I have.
<Conyst> Talking about which series of FMA is better.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica and I'm fine with that.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Morty> sexy back
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Subs is the best version thah should exist
<Rainbow> lol
<CriticKitten> Edward got back~
<Morty> Ed's bring sexy back
<RainbowJack> lol a nother BLONDmoment
<Morty> yeah
<paradise92> @Sumica and it is the best version...even better then dubs..i really hate dubs
<Morty> and all you hummunculi don't know how to act
<Sumica> 00,10How ever some shows I am fine with dubs such as bebop and Gits
<Morty> yeah
<DubZbrony> Is there any Site to post and upload Pony drawings for rating and such?...Got alot i want to show the Internet already :D?
<Fazana> Depends how well it's done
<paradise92> @Sumica and dragon ball z :S
<flutter_spin> Some series I wouldn't mind watching with dubs. Others I wouldn't care.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica it all depends on who dubs/subs it.
<Fazana> F-zero Gp Legend was dubbed pretty well
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> deviant art ?
<Morty> this ending theme makes me wet myself
<Rainbow> DeviantArt?
<Morty> (not pee)
<Syndicate> XD
<Sumica> 00,10I gave up on dbz back when it was on toonami
<paradise92> Actually i love the Green Dub version of Dragon Ball Z :) :)
<DubZbrony> Random Freestyle Art of ponies
<Syndicate> Yeah. I prefer Dragon Ball.
<Fazana> Toonami good CNT bad
<RaveBrony> :D
<Hat> Jello
<Morty> just be glad you didn't have to see the abomination that was GT
<Sumica> 00,105min to blow up a planet. 12 eps later still not blowen up
<paradise92> FOR GREEN DUB:Saiyans - Space Warrior
<flutter_spin> really? I started when Vegeta entered and then I stopped right when Cell came in
<DubZbrony> Got few Paintings too ^^
<Rainbow> I prefer DB, too
<Morty> dbz GT was a disgrace to a great show
<alexxm> is any one streaming
<Syndicate> Am I the only one that thought Dragon Ball was better than DBZ?
<RainbowJack> GT was really BAD
<Syndicate> ^
<RainbowJack> i liked DBZ better
<tgl1992> How bad was GT? Never saw that one
<Rainbow> Me gusta DB
<Syndicate> I liked the martial arts of DB
<Morty> GT shat all over DBZ cannon too
<flutter_spin> I did go back and watch some Dragonball. I don't prefer one over the other
<paradise92> Syndicate not the only one
<Syndicate> Oh yeah!
<Morty> oh fuck did i miss Roy vs Lust?
<paradise92> Syndicate DB you could see the fighting...DBZ only flashes and pictures
<flutter_spin> lol morty
<Sumica> 00,10he lives!
<Morty> damnit i did
<Fazana> Yes
<Fazana> It was AWESOME and BRUTAL as well
<Syndicate> What the buck happened to Saiyans not being able to grow hair?! Vegeta got a mustache and I was like WTF?!
<Morty> i missed lust face
<Morty> you guys know
<Dark_Horst> ....i've never been in one of tthose hospitals, mind showing me one?
<Syndicate> Paradise92: I know! I loved the martial arts!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Roy mustang is best pony ?
<paradise92> going to Pee brb
<alexxm> sounds like i missed something awosme
<CriticKitten> Roy Mustang IS best pony
<Fazana> No
<Syndicate> ^
<Fazana> NO
<Rainbow> Roy ain't a pony
<Fazana> NIOO
<Syndicate> No.
<flutter_spin> Pretty much anything on Toonami. It was THE place to watch shows.
<Fazana> Hughes is best pony
<Rainbow> BUT
<Rainbow> No
<Rainbow> Chuck Norris is best pony
<Dark_Horst> did that guys just smoke a hotdog?
<CriticKitten> Roy doesn't have "fights", he has one-sided beatdowns
<Fazana> Chuck Norris Schmuch schmorris
<RainbowJack> Louise Best Pegasis
<Everlasting_Joy> Suddenly, Fazana dies.
<Rainbow> Chck Norris doesn't have fights
<Rainbow> He doesn't need to
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in that case mustang is best horse
<Fazana> Chuck Norris Vs. Armstrong, armstrong wins
<Rainbow> He loojks at people.
<Syndicate> I killed Chuck Norris.

<CriticKitten> I remember this too. OH GOD.
<ScootaChicken> G3 has a far better animation style, and the character development is very good
<ScootaChicken> the voice acting is also of a much higher quality than G4.
<StinkomanFan> And if I wanna know something and people try to change the subject as fast as RD can fly it only makes me want to know MORE
<kidzrul434> If you put Nyan Cat in a toaster, does it come out as rainbow dash?
<StinkomanFan> So spill the frigging beans on G3.6

<PrototypeX9000> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2138/
<Meanwhile> Well, since realistically I've only played the game for 98 minutes, have only 3 achieves and suck at it, I'm just gonna pass.
<Darf14> I wonder why I havent bought that game yet, I should buy it
<Derpy_Hooves> scoot-scootaloo is taking on my challenge
<Derpy_Hooves> aint that right scoots?
<robotdragon6> RAWRity:mine is about equestria forming an underground resistance against an alien race, but im not posting it...
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo wins by deficit of being the only contender.
<Derpy_Hooves> well no..
<Dken2021> if you like those hard types of games like I wanna be the guy, then maybe you'll like it
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:D
<Twilightsparkle> The end is very intriguing do you have a chapter 2

<Derpy_Hooves> there is no deadline
<Darf14> I already played and beat IWBTH Dken, so Super Meat Boy sounds like a good challenge
