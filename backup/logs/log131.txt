<Twilightsprkly> inb4 oh yeah
<The_Mole> and rainbow pulls twilight by her tail...
<crickettwb> Yeah, that always annoyed the heck out of me. Just freaking style up 2 shortened moustaches.
<MehPlusRawr> So. Rarity just cut her tail off with a water dragon's scale, so she could use it to replace half his moustache so he'd help them cross this crazy lake and defeat an evil pony that was trapped in the moon for a thousand years. Also, the dragon was named Steven Magnet.

*Tr0llestia can see forever
<Drunklestia> Brony_All_Night they inherented the talent from their parents, it's a monarchy after all

<TitaniumTicTac> fuckyea.jpg
<cal_zd> in season two, but she's still coming back
<G3nESiS> NOPE
<DJ_BR0N3> haha, why didnt they show the result of that bet?
<Ham993> Ending credit songs are so weird. The entire lyrics are "My little pony, friends."
<Lordshadow> You know... with how much the writers seem to pay attention to the fandom... I wouldn't be surprised, if in season 2, Luna wears socks/has an abacus.
<PinkyPyro> bet they're red and green, not golden
<Disco_Bandit> YES
<mib_ee6mfd> 123
<crickettwb> Stop wasting apples!!!!!!!!
<RainbowDash1> HOW ABOUT BIG SAC
<MuNova> NewDCD: Yesssss
<|yum|Fluttershy> They should release granny smith's girdle as an accessory.
<Octavia> 13She was pretty on top for the trail though too.
<Liferake> RAWRity that's pretty good reason actually
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Faust explains that Celestia is meant to be the perfect example of mare beauty in Equestria. Faust also explains that Luna looks so different because she's not only younger, but hasn't reached her full potential yet.
<CrazyPie> Spike quit wasting apples!!
<Billzack> Lagmobile is right
<Tovler> Stirrup Street is sick
<Ford_Prefect> I'm always thinking about butt sex

<Billzack> Grand Galloping Trollestia!
<OceanMist> At the gala!
<NewDCD> 9okay guys
<ScrollHunter> Vomit up <my name>
<RainbowDash1> Moral of this episode: Don't eat food in the rain

<mib_ee6mfd> and magic makes it all complete
<Zephirdd> didnt we all?
<Jon> TIME TO OD ON MORE PONIES
<Luna> 07So any thoughts about Robotpinkie?
<Waifles> Celestia might not have sent it herself, rather an underling.
<greyknight_cmd> or set up your dvr
<G3nESiS> FRIENDDD
<Prancypants> Be an immortal goddess, befriend mortal ponies, watch them age and die ... laugh.

<BRAWNFLANKTHUNDERCLO> 0freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<RaggedStar> Trollestia: knows you have 5 friends, only sends 2 tickets
<Sebiale> What must it take to injure a pony? I mean Twilight takes falling objects well, and Fluttershy probably would have survived hitting the ground too.
<Sen> See you all at the premiere
<TitaniumTicTac> Ever notice Twilight teleports at the end of the theme?
<Poots> Dragons, dragons burping everywhere.
<Flameshy> I agree RainbowDash1
<shadow> doc your where ever gone?

<MehPlusRawr> ^
<Rock> i just realised
<mib_7wwq1r> PONY OVERDOSE
<Thecat> Trollestia uses Tickets, Super effective, hit (2) times.
<shadow> were*
<ScrollHunter> 4PONIES... Y U NO TASTE RAINBOW!?
<Robo-Dale> ITALIAN INTRO IS EPIC I WISH I COULD SPEAK ITALIAN
<Techicorn> 22 min = wonderful
<sklar> opopo
<fluttercup> sup
<OceanMist> Its prettymuch the same intro from G1
<wednesday> Gotta keep the royal blood to the few.
<UberMudkipz> u srs
<Waifles> That being said, it could in fact be Luna causing all this misleading information.
<Octavia> 13Octavia is in charge! >:D
<Wazaraku> It makes sense, specially since Luna technically STOPPED growing when she became NMM so now the diference is actually bigger
<xavier07> Case 2
<Botuts> lol spike
<Flutter> Spoiler warning!
<Vis> It's hard /not/ to start a meme writing for this series
<Drunklestia> "WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY TO SEND YOU SIX TICKETS, TWILIGHT?"
<Flutter> :)
<[NLR]Lucid> Random speculation, but judging by the wording of the letter, it wasn't actually from the princess, it is worded more like a "To Whom it May Concern" type of letter
<RandomExtra> Got in here just in time.
<VioletVanilla> 6I will just leave it up to you
<UberMudkipz> spike eats em
<Turtaguin> WOOO!
<Rock> spike derps eyes
<green> DJ BROny : they o in applebucking season
<MehPlusRawr> hard mode: no sleep until S2E2
<lunamoonie> its sad that lauren fraust doesnt work on mlp fim any mor
<G3nESiS> IVE GOT A GOLDEN TICKET
<RaggedStar> lol
<brony4life> 0 11min episodes probably means less songs
<Tovler> where did you get your enhanced speech versions of MLP?
<Lordshadow> Celestia originally intended for Twilight to take Spike.
<Quinn197> THE GRAND GALOPING PLOT POINT
<mib_7wwq1r> i bet, spike
<cal_zd> I despised Celestia in A Bird in the Hoof
<shadow> but 20%cooler
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Celestia's letter is explained through royal duties. The letter sent to Spike starts with "Hear ye" rather than "my Faithful Student". It wasn't directly from Celestia. Also, most if not all mass invites like this are meant to be +1, hence only 2 tickets sent.
<BabyDoll> Two tickets to paradise!
<Owlowiscious> ScrollHunter: No colors
<KanyeEast> maybe its the male ponies who are extremely fragile
<kyo> blueblood just like in the old days
<Lordshadow> Hence the 2 tickets.
<fredfred99> I got a Golden Ticket!! :D

<Brony134> i bet you she is begged by all of her friends
<ScrollHunter> 0:[ Is this color correct?
<LupalFillyus> but i assume is the big bad?
<Sebiale> Crackfic idea: Ponies try to start a war. Then find they can't kill each other no matter how hard they try, just a bunch of cartoon damage.
<TitaniumTicTac> -Spike
<BabyDoll> LAAAAAAAAMB SEX!
<mib_g0ff8y> cuz i got a golden ticket...
<LordCelestia> BLANK FLANKS
<kjjejones42> I think a nuke would do it. Can;t be more precise though

<|yum|Fluttershy> Napping: what we'll all be busy doing tomorrow.
<mib_7wwq1r> SO AWESOME
<wednesday> I hate the wonderbolts. Gunna ruin that sweet rainbow color with thier fart smoke.
<Owlowiscious> DARI WHY
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Celestia also openly states that the gala is boring. It's most likely she never invited Twilight due to knowing that her student wouldn't enjoy it.
<RainbowDash1> but it's cute
<NelBell> I need to go to the gala because I need attention.
<Owlowiscious> WHY LIGHT BLUE
<RainbowDash1> somehow
<Tr0llestia> "I was busy...fapping"
<shadow> lol
<Sebiale> crickettwb lol
<crazy-otaku> "I was busy... napping." Sounds like me. lololololol
<Obscure> Some people suspect
<Scootaloo> hey guys lets read Cupcakes. Best thing to ever happen to Dash...
<Owlowiscious> I CAN'T READ ANYTHING
<DSNesmith> lordshadow whyyyyy
<TitaniumTicTac> A CHANCE TO F THE WONDERBOLTS? Sorry, I had to.
<MrChang> AJ's reason is still better than RD's
<DoctorValor> Then I watched the Equestria Online stream
<StevethePocket> Rainbow Dash: Used to sleeping on clouds, has no problem napping on a hard tree branch
<brony4life> 0derpy
<Ultra_Boom3> Because it isn't REAL BAWWW
<ScrollHunter> 0i just got random-kicked

<DJPon3> DERPY!
<Tifa> I am SO going to stay up 'till S2
<G3nESiS> DERPY
<Brony_All_Night> derpy hooves!
<Zeitgeist> She was watching you Applejack because she loves you.
<Ford_Prefect> with her massive ego
<green> Dash crashes thier show
<Somepony> She's a scout
<[NLR]Lucid> Random thought, but if I was Twilight, I would give the ticket to Applejack, since her goal is more...noble
<xavier07> I love this trivia
<RainbowDash1> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e701e342a49756250676dc3fab5c2685/51353%20-%20artist:cartoonlion%20fluttershy%20futa%20futanari%20futashy%20humanized%20rainbow_dash%20rarity.png
<shadow> then a sonicrainboom
<Pinkamena> I'm meeting a guy to discuss playing music
<mib_ee6mfd> and I would rape every pony in the crowd
<C9317> she wants a chance to f*ck the wonderbolts!
<Brony134> DERPY
<TitaniumTicTac> DERPY!
<VendorPony> HATERS GONNA HATE
<Billzack> Why they Fart Smog?!?
<Drunklestia> THEN I WOULD VIOLATE SECURE AIRSPACE AND BE IMPRISONED!
<RAWRity> crickettwb I'm guessing Pinkie Pie would be Wonka in this scenario
<Draik> Rainbow Dash is just gonna butt into the wonderbolts' performance
<RainbowDash1> that's cute too
<G3nESiS> DERPY
<mib_7wwq1r> RAINBOW DASH!
<Blinky> Because crashing their performance would really make them happy!
<Hat> ye
<Waifles> look
<UberMudkipz> lol
<Katida> Oh, wow.
<OceanMist> Spys, Spys everywhere
<Waifles> cutie mark isn't on both sides of her flankl
<Ham993> Good question. Maybe she was just... Smith.
<P0n3Swag> just crash the party rainbow dash
<Lordlyhour> Fandom, Pets, Part, Lovesickness VERSUS Money required for living
<coggy9chat> Derpy.
<Disco_Bandit> FILLY FLASH
<fluttercup> haha beat you to it
<TwilightSparkle> Tricks: Super speed strut fantastic filly flash The buckaneer blaze
<cbpony9001> DERRRRRRP A HERP
<Metostopholes> After the new episode I'm trying out Nature Blossom's lucid dreaming technique again
<MuNova> Silverscreen: When did she say that before ep 26?
<Ford_Prefect> season 2 had better have some derpy
<Grandpa_Joe> I never thought my life would be..
<shadow> nice
<Owlowiscious> Scootaloo: Best be jokin' >:k
<prince-dari> Silverscreen: More propaganda! ALL LIES! TROLLESTIA IS PURE TROLL!
<Jon> Then why invite her now suddenly silverscreen?
<|yum|Fluttershy> Rainbow Dash clearly has no idea what the gala is.
<G3nESiS> DERPY!
<Scootaloo> lol Philly Flash
<Sebiale> Filly Flash <.<
<Ravager> i see derpy
<Silverscreen> 11It's more Wild Mass Guessing rather than trivia.
<Prancypants> derpers gonna derp
<AngryPeanut> 0Seriously, she has an obsession
<Poots> Actually, does anyone know if the 2 parter will be one episode after another or an episode today and tomorrow?
<Katida> Grandpa_Joe, really? XD
<Lordlyhour> also, filly flash sounds dirty
<NelBell> Dep

<crickettwb> I always thought about that during this episode.
<cirek> why not just do the SONIC-RAINBOOM
<LupalFillyus> INSTANT DERPY
<Grandpa_Joe> Anything but catastrophe..
<riverhippo> i wonder what a buccaneer blaze looks like
<shadow> those gapes
<mallam> what happened to sonic rainboom?
<DoctorValor> Ma'am Smith....
<Jon> So she can be bored with a friend?
<StevethePocket> @Somepony "Basically? Kind of a big deal."
<DSNesmith> sup derpy
<Zephirdd> buckaneer blaze?

<RaggedStar> !
<G3nESiS> FACEPALM
<TitaniumTicTac> as have i ScrollHunter
<Brony134> thats how Derpys eyes got messed up
<greyknight_cmd> drep drep drep
<Sebiale> Super Speed Strut is pretty awesome.
<Thunder_Dash> To recap - AJ wants to go for her family, Rarity wants to go for her future, so does RD, Fluttershy wants to go out of curiousity, and Pinkie wants to go to get diabetes
<Darf14> And theres Spit Fire
<wyatt> dash naps everywhere
<RandomExtra> Same here.
<KanyeEast> I wonder if celestias hair is radioactive. I know thats a random thought
<Int_Mane_Void> Seriously now, RD is the only pony in known history to do a Sonic Rainboom. Twice. Why the hell isn't she on the team already?
<Pinkamena> *hump hump hump*
<wednesday> Waisting that color

<MuNova> Rainboom >>>>>>> Buccaneer Blitz
<Grandpa_Joe> I think i'll stop there
<Rock> is that your blowclop face?
<mib_g0ff8y> I heard that in season two they were actually going to rename the pony derpy
<shadow> i cant wait till winter wrap up

<wednesday> waisting I tell you
<Drunklestia> I aim to please, Billzack
<xavier07> Sounds legit
<MuNova> er, Blaze
<Error_404> God damn I love this cocky bitch
<Zephirdd> sonic rainboom is not worth the wonderbolts.
<MehPlusRawr> "Whoa! You fucked up our flying routine! New member!"
<Rock> XD
<LGNR> Rainbow looks horrible in that outfit.
<R-Zack> Trollestia is gonna have a run for her money with Discord around.
<LunaTheGreat> SPIT FIRE YAH!
<Scootaloo> Rainbow Dash = Overrated
<|yum|Fluttershy> yuck
<Sebiale> Well the sun is radioactive.
<Ford_Prefect> FUCK I NEED TO BUY SOME MUFFINS
<KanyeEast> but people keep comparing it to the aurora borealis
<Kiba_The_Shamed> LIVING. THE DREAM.
<DJ_BR0N3> i've always wondered where that smoke comes from
<mib_jsa8d8> Is the stream thingy on now? I can't see anything.
<mib_g0ff8y> since her name is ditzy
<Obscure> I like that high speed strut

<RainbowFox> Wait, but Pinkie Pie IS diabetes.
<tHEsMOOZE> 0DIABEETUS
<mib_mhhl6v> DIABETAS
<DethPotato> Rainbow Dash can't join because she poops rainbows.
<PinkyPyro> surprise in wonderbolt outfit
<green> later in this episode it is revealed she wants to give it to applejack and fluttershy
<greyknight_cmd> DIABITES
<R-Zack> Trollestia turned him into stone so she can be best troll.
<TitaniumTicTac> One pony pickin' minute
<RainbowDash1> Futashy is cute
<OMN2> LIVING THE DREAM
<Flutter> This can be my only chance to show mu junk

<Flutter> oh wait
<BakedMacintosh> the trolling has now taken effect
<RAWRity> super speed strut = Flash Steps
<Int_Mane_Void> Wingboner
<Shutterfly> lol i love how applejack is the only one with a _legitimate_ reason but it sitll becomes a problem
<Thunder_Dash> > Overrated
<Clonehunter> sudden lag
<Tehpogo> Rainbow Dash once flew so fast all her future friends instantly hit puberty.
<Sebiale> It explains everything: everypony is a mutant with super-durability :P
<DethPotato> So it doesn't match.
<RainbowDash1> :3
<Thunder_Dash> NOPE.avi
<mallam> Hoof Wrestle!
<DjBrony> stretchy neck
<The_SuperiorTaste> WANNA HOOFWRESTLE!!!!!
<xavier07> Hoof Wrassle!

<DethPotato> Like it's supposed to.
<Kokonoe> I CHALLENGE YOU TO A POKEMON BATTLE
<Grundle> Oh, sweet foreshadowing
<TitaniumTicTac> No lag here
<OceanMist> necks dont work like that.
<UberMudkipz> *Trollestia emails the tickets*
<Waifles> Pinkie Pie wants to go to the gala to spread hte joy of parties
<lunamoonie> phsh, i like derpy hooves better
<AngryPeanut> 0Gentlecolts. This is what rue love looks like
<DJ_BR0N3> left handed?
<Lordshadow> Interesting fact: Celestia's guards' armor covers their flank, presumably to hide their identity or that their calling isn't "Protect the princess"
<Hat> that would have solved it
<greyknight_cmd> DIABITUS
<Tr0llestia> RBD is a bitch, but somehow still lovable.
<cal_zd> err. tomorrow
<RainbowFox> D-D-D-Diabetus.
<Robo-Dale> Rainbow dash will never join the wonderbolts cuz shes too awesome for them anyways
<MuNova> mib_jsa8d8: Yes. Switch to low quality and it should work

<Waifles> to make everypony happy
<Somepony> Indeed
<Zephirdd> Silverscreen: plot hole?
<Disco_Bandit> DASHIE
<Prancypants> Applejack's reason is making money
<Ford_Prefect> that would be the ultimate pandering and I support it
<mib_ee6mfd> or we could settle this the good ole fashion way: make out contest
<shadow> problem about bestest reason
<cal_zd> 30 minutes
<Robo-Dale> plus spitfire is a troll
<Prancypants> that's not legitimate
<Draik> the two ponies who are most alike really hate each other.
<Tovler> Rainbow Dash > Soulja Boi Tellem
<brony4life> 0spoilers jeez... j/k
<R-Zack> Mr.Toots poops rainbows.

<Buytoast> Discord probablygives Pinkie diabetes just to prank her.
<DumbRock> a chance to **** the wonderbolts
<R-Zack> DEADLY LAZERS RAINBOWS.
<[NLR]Lucid> No, I think that Rainbow Dash wouldn't be sure that she would be able to pull off the Rainboom regularly enough to work it into the shy
<TerraH> Hehe, DisQord
<Nyte_crawler> Poor Granny Smith
<Darf14> I would Pick Rainbow Dash
<Kiba_The_Shamed> LIVING. THE DREAM.

<IKlik> Rainbow Dash is winning.

<ancara24> 23 episodes before epic troll to rarity.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Spike never mentions a thing when Rarity mentions meeting Celestia's Nephew. This is because he would already know how much of a douche he is.

<Jon> Later-Magic is something you always know when is happening.

<RAWRity> I'll certainly agree that Trixie was an obnoxious lying showboat, and not very likeable at all, but Gilda was mean...because she thinks everybody's lame. Neither are good personality traits, but I find trixie's more tolerable than Gilda
