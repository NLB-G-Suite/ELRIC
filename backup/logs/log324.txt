<pony_9049> Mods: When I use Safari as a browser, your 'cast hangs up on the 7-second mark in the "This ad will close in" countdown. The screen and the stream are visible behind that notice, but the "close" box never appears below it and the screen remains grayed out. The problem doesn't iccur with Mozilla Firefox.
<Quin2> i would kill a man if it opened a portal to equestra. Say I if you would do the same
<TopHat> that was deep
<Polaris> And your good to river..I mean strea,
<Zander> OMG BLACK SCREEN
<ThunderThorn> derpy_pony: those are just my results, though
<Simon> SuperBrony64: did you take the pony personality test? which pony are you mostly like?
<Buytoast> The more time this spends loading, the more I get to listen to the Psycho intro music.
<J-rook> todays ep dosn't sound to intresting, heres hopeing for another lesson zero
<TopHat> I
<Buytoast> So it's all good.
<Bane_Kai> umm...

<dashy9> OH BOY A BUFFERING BAR
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thank you for your patience, we will currently be back up in a matter of a few min. Thanks again for your continued patronage.
<Phase4> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/0aa16ccee201ab0210f4cecfd397e2a3.jpg << is me
<Polaris> I've had the mlp fim intro on repeat for 2 weeks now
<Quin2> AND you got to be a pony
<OhItsFluttershy> I don't know, I mean Dash learning about books?
<dashy9> CIRCLE
<pony_1v1> why would you kill a man who opened a portal to equestria?
<ThunderThorn> or more Derpy!
<OhItsFluttershy> That could be a lot of fun!
<ColorStorm> Simon: I got Rainbow Dash
<dashy9> THING
<Bane_Kai> Opening portals to other dimensions would disturb the natural order...
<Amazon> Can someone record the stream coming in five hours?
<Plotbuster> no dude, this pic is all that is pony
<Shrimp3000> Intermission: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtRBtIJULw
<Simon> Phase4: lol Twilight Sparkle
<Zander> The waiting has been doubled
<J-rook> thats next week
<OhItsFluttershy> Somebody play some muzak
<Quin2> no the killing of the man is required to open it
<JamesIsABrony> lines that make a circle, bro
<Simon> yay Intermission
<derpy_pony> no love for the mule, Phase4 ?
<OhItsFluttershy> It is?
<J-rook> more AJ today

<Quin2> yes
<OhItsFluttershy> Oh, right
<TopHat> pet..
<Phase4> all my rarity was dumped into twi
<JamesIsABrony> i refreshed so i wouldnt have to look at it anymore. i was getting a pony related boner, and that aint right.
<sunny_F3> I would not kill - because it's not what ponis teaching us
<Bane_Kai> ..... causeing both dimensions to collide, and therefore, be detroyed
<dashy9> OF COURSE IT IS RIGHT
<ThunderThorn> http://imgur.com/Ba9dl what about you?
<OhItsFluttershy> Well, it does involve 2 swidlin' brothers, right?
<J-rook> Aj bets the farm in a applecider contest
<pony_1v1> ow i get it. so you need to murder a man to open it, but murderes ant allowed inside
<OhItsFluttershy> I could go for that
<Zander> DUdE NO JUST NO
<whosasexypony> lol sonic x
<Zander> :[
<Quin2> this is MY hypotheitcal situation
<dashy9> Dude im kidding

<JamesIsABrony> IS IT JUST ME AND YOU?
<Vivix> Ill have to put it on my to read list, I dont listen to readings that much
<JamesIsABrony> caps lock
<vinovin> i think
<vinovin> but i cant watch
<derpy_pony> Everyone is talking about "my little dashie" in the last days...they say it's sad too
<NotYourAverageBrony> : / ..... I'm feeling very anxious and sad

<BSODGUY> mee too
<Woonanon> I read my little dashie. It was sad, but it didn't get me tearing up
<sunny_F3> me 2
<Vivix> It's supposedly very good though, but wasnt my thing
<Amazon> this is my resault on the pony quiz http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/240/834/07c.jpg

<OhItsFluttershy> Oh, while we're all gathered here, does anybody want to read a pony song parody I wrote?
<Bane_Kai> I'm gonna play around on FL studios now...
<Block_Comment> it is certialy hard for a fanfic to get me teared up if I know it's supposed to have a reputation for being really sad in advance
<Vivix> I think, everyone who likes nightmaremoon, must read after that fateful night-
<OhItsFluttershy> It's to the tune of Ice Cube's "Today's a Good Day"
<Amazon> ...kinda was hoping it to be rainbowdash but w/e

<CyberKing> oh dear
<Lovs2smuge> and i dced so i missed the scene
<justwannahavefun> The problem with all nighters is that you dont get to sleep for 36 hours and not 24, if you dont want to mess up your day/night cycle.
<Lovs2smuge> but everyone went crazy
<Lovs2smuge> and there was like five messages a second

<Vivix> I really liked it
<Brony2you> Alright alright Ill add you :)
<DJneonblue> hmmmm
<justwannahavefun> One-nighters once in a while is tolerable for most ppl, but if you must do it consistently for, months with 4-5 hours of sleep when you dont do an all nighter tend to mess people up.
<DJneonblue> did you try really small curlers?
<Cyrix_-> yay
<Cyrix_-> :3
<Vivix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYPG1wAlssQ&feature=youtu.be This is the only finished ponysong I've uploaded-

<Vivix> I'm horrible wiht videos so its only a picture- and whenever I linke stuff I get really nervous
<DJneonblue> so I make the best of it...
<DJneonblue> with ponies... :3
<Ryanlauph> Does Hasbro make Derpy toys? :P
<Skitsmore> Howdy!
<TrueLight> I used straws lol, and I ran out of bobby pins and had to use paperclips
<fluttershy_123> ;)
<idontevenknow> There needs to be derpy toys
<Charles> penis is funny in every language
<TrueLight> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Brony2you> I like the flow :o
<Brony> :D
<fluttershy_123> true dat

<bugeyes8> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4 my internetting always leads back to this song.
<TrueLight> Next year we will have Derpy toys. It was in one of Nostradamus's predictions.
<Charles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=-bNCfEvQFUY&feature=endscreen
<idontevenknow> I wish there was something to look at
*Phase4|Experiment is experimenting
<Brony2you> AhHH
<TWISTeD398> an AJ-centric episode would be kind of boring i think
<Cyrix_-> runescape ._.
<Brony2you> misclicked
<Bane_Kai> I'm still awake!
<Brony2you> What did you ask?
<Cyrix_-> whats your rs name lol
<DJneonblue> yeah, I dont get why hasbro doesn't see US as a potential consumer...
<Brony2you> Guess
<justwannahavefun> So the stream is down? I thought my flash player is acting funny :D
<Simon> Have you guys listened to this new song: Borgore - Flex (Dubstep Mix)?
<Brony2you> :p
<DJneonblue> I mean we are the ones with jobs, not little girls XD
<Cyrix_-> rsmv2you
<Brony2you> Ding ding ding :p
<fluttershy_123> new borgor?
<Vivix> hehe
<Brony> no
<fluttershy_123> borgore*
<JowHoof> Hasbro should make plushies
<bugeyes8> Every night i evetually find my way back to that song
<TrueLight> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!
<DJneonblue> they should
<CanadianSinna> ^
<Ryanlauph> brb, breakfast time... hope there's no toast-juice :S
<JowHoof> My house lacks plushies
<Lovs2smuge> well this is an AJish episode
<Brony2you> vivix you might wanna work on balancing out the sounds on the spark song
<Simon> there is an official video posted on ukfdubstep, but it got 18+ limitation later on
<idontevenknow> God I wish
<Vivix> yeah-
<Brony2you> seems to get a bit clustered at around 2:00
<fluttershy_123> link?
<fluttershy_123> plz
<Lovs2smuge> but i doubt she'll do anything
<Simon> so much dislikes, probably because the video suck'd, though the drop is sick
<Lovs2smuge> cept make cider
<Skitsmore> I need to take poop, But hallway at night is scawy..
<richfiles> Oh my... I did that pony personality thing, it looked like a friggin arrow head. 99% aimed at Twilight, with a thin shaft pointing down to fluttershy... :$ :(
<Vivix> hm, I'll work on the mix, sadly I'm limited to mono speakers atm
<fluttershy_123> i love borgore
<idontevenknow> Someone bought a life size Rainbow Dash plushie from ebay
<Lovs2smuge> which americans assure me is apple juice
<DJneonblue> only pony related item I ever came close to buying on ebay was a miniature pluchie of derpy
<idontevenknow> a few months agp
<justwannahavefun> Are you saying that Hasbro should make merchandise that appeals to our subculture?
<Lovs2smuge> i still think they making alchohol
<Simon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9h5v5bTRIw
<Brony2you> aaannnddd... Done.
<DJneonblue> that is exactly what I'm saying
<TrueLight> So wait is there actually anything in the stream right now?
<CanadianSinna> why not?
<DJneonblue> in addition to what it has now
<Charles> is there any way to not be twilight in that thing
<derpy_pony> because twilight simply is best pony
<Brony2you> finally done with this drawing
<Skitsmore> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkWCg3f0KWo&feature=g-all-u&context=G2c5ad15FAAAAAAAATAA
<bugeyes8> He has a point
<Vivix> whatche drawin?
<Simon> This is my map http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/240777
<Brony2you> Its not ponys but I like it :3 http://i.imgur.com/Q9Xic.png
<Bane_Kai> actually, when horses eat apples it gives them the sensation of drunkenness...
<Ryanlauph> No... I don't think the channel is 24hrs
<Lovs2smuge> indeed
<justwannahavefun> Well it would be more money for them, so thats not the reason why they arent doing it.
<Charles> ARE YOU DUMB Yes/No. No. YOU ARE NOT TWILIGHT
<Pinkie_> I don't think so True, I don't see nothin. I been watching it buffering for a bit.
<Brony2you> I probably should have made the horizon more defined
<TrueLight> Ah. KK I was just wondering whether I needed to use another browser or something.
<idontevenknow> It wont be on until the new episode
<Vivix> Ah nice
<bugeyes8> are you talking shit about twilight?
<Cyrix_-> gah
<TWISTeD398> two of our horses would drink beer
<TrueLight> It's worth the wait.
<justwannahavefun> Though I dont know what kind of merch could be more appealing to someone our age...
<richfiles> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=OTYwNnwxMzEyNjM you got NUTHIN' on me! :$
<Lovs2smuge> hmmm
<Bane_Kai> but apple cider is like a spackling apple juice... very sweet and tangy
<bugeyes8> Bitch i'll break you
<JowHoof> Well a little bit earlier than that.
<Lovs2smuge> okay
<justwannahavefun> A spitfire lighter maybe?
<Brony2you> ?
<JowHoof> PLUSHIES. That is all
<Bane_Kai> *sparkling
<Cyrix_-> nothing
<LaQuack> have the toys with a little more attention to details?
<Lovs2smuge> i assumed so
<CanadianSinna> A spitfire zippo whould be sweet
<Ryanlauph> Something pony related:
<Ryanlauph> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBGA2pAkNTg
<Block_Comment> this is like the second or third most boring livestream I've ever watched
<Bane_Kai> brb... must make hot pocket!
<TWISTeD398> not as watered down as apple juice, and can have alcohol
<derpy_pony> never seen such a result before
<DJneonblue> ... pony decals and stickers for an iphone or ipod?
<Simon> is there a stream going on right now?
<Vivix> It reminds me ofe concept drawings in the colour
<TWISTeD398> made with more spices
<richfiles> I don't even HAVE the video window loaded. I'm just chatting, adn Skyrimming.
<LaQuack> i like that idea blue
<Ryanlauph> Just wondering... do we all have the same ads?
<derpy_pony> wait for the part with the spinning helix, Block_Comment
<Vivix> like landscapes and--things in game plans
<DJneonblue> I saw pony shirts at hot topic
<Ryanlauph> "You are today's iPad 2 winner!"
<Lovs2smuge> yer i'm gonna have breakfast soon
<CanadianSinna> what about cases?
<JowHoof> I don't get ads
<Ictiv> So then... Good morning once again everyone!

<Ryanlauph> I want a pony iPhone case

<Polydunami> Typical
<DJneonblue> pony iphone apps
<LaQuack> not a fan of cases...
<Brony2you> I simply like making it like that because there is no focus point
<Ryanlauph> At the least a pony background
<DJneonblue> ... ones that dont teach us how to spell but... other stuff XD
<Lovs2smuge> scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon and whatever else i have in the house

<Gameman246> It's 10:30pm here.
<Ictiv> richfiles: since you are "Skyrimming" I send you this happy little song that just entered my mind and I can't get rid off *To the tune of 'Star Trekkin':* Sky-rimming! Across all Tamriel! Killing dragons, taking names; all in the gods' name! Sky-rimming! Wow that looked so cool! I didn't think that dragons~were that flamable!
<Skitsmore> I'm hoping a derpy fuck up

<Scootaloo_rules> o god she beat her to near death...awesome! but no :(
<Gamewizardinnc> Oh... Time to play Deus Ex!

<LaQuack> i doubt she will appear as often
<Brony2you> Sadly I hate most of them. But some of them are awesome
<Cyrix_-> I only have like 3
<Quin2> *posts*

<TWISTeD398> :$
*String_Shredder yawns "u guys r still here?"
<Vivix> My friends are scared of becoming bronies

<pony_1311> It's a comp of about 3 archives

<Gorbash> It depends on the channel sometimes
<Cyrix_-> but is that a deadmou5 shirt?
<Lovs2smuge> yeah
<pony_1311> yeah and it's got all the tumblar's up until december 2011
<brusselsprout> I studied german for a while
<idontevenknow> i like the clop pics but im not that insane
<Lovs2smuge> that's why i like the BBC
<Lovs2smuge> no ads
<Brony2you> hellz yeah
<pony_1311> so like pinkamenadianepie
<pony_1311> by crooked trees
<derpy_pony> why?
<Cyrix_-> damn right
<LaQuack> you guys have to remember, this show is not only for us internet junkies
<Bane_Kai> really.... diddn't know that
<brusselsprout> It was fun
<pony_2480> Is there any video currently on the stream?
<justwannahavefun> I think they are not allowed to read fanfics.
<Gorbash> PBS our ad-free channel here
<Lovs2smuge> cool
<brusselsprout> german and english has a lot of similarities
<pony_1311> if you guys haven't seen it it's a one on one with Pinkamena as she prepares ponies from ponyville for cupcake making.
<Rough_Draft> http://mlfw.info/f/2507/
<Gorbash> Public Funded as a result
<CanadianSinna> hahaha lol i only have 49 MB
<Lovs2smuge> yer
<derpy_pony> they have the same roots....are just different dialects of the same language
<Brony2you> lol
<pony_1311> If you guys have links to archives let me know
<Brony2you> Indeed, almost time for canon shiping.
<LaQuack> haha puny amount of pictures is puny
<Gorbash> But at least they entertain us when they start requesting donations
<Vivix> Valentine
<DJneonblue> I honestly don't participate in the clopping to pony pics... it would take the innocence out of it
<Vivix> might ruin soo many ships
<TWISTeD398> lol
<Lovs2smuge> lol
<derpy_pony> plus the british had the norman invasion
<Cyrix_-> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-YFDV-5x8A&feature=related
<idontevenknow> But its fun
<pony_1311> not for me
<pony_1856> *shrug* :I
<Lovs2smuge> here it's payed by tv licence
<DJneonblue> no offense against people who do, hey if thats your thing... thats your thing...
<Gorbash> Here's 50 minutes worth of opera, please donate
<DJneonblue> just kinda weirds me out
<LaQuack> yeah rule 34 with ponies kinda taints it for me
<DJneonblue> personally speaking
<justwannahavefun> Yeah its not for me either.
<Brony2you> There aren't even enough male characters for all mane 6 to even have crushes on...
<pony_1311> They are still innocent and that's what makes it so much better
<idontevenknow> I mostly clop to Rainbow Dash
<LaQuack> ironically rule 34 is what i first saw if mlp
<justwannahavefun> I mean its not my thing.
<Bane_Kai> eyup
<TWISTeD398> No way that cash cow is going to be seen on public television
<DJneonblue> first thing I saw of mlp... if you can believe this, was on the first commercials for the hub
<Lovs2smuge> lol
<Gorbash> haha
<Bane_Kai> opera.... not Oprah
<derpy_pony> test
<Lovs2smuge> oh right
<TWISTeD398> oh LOL
<DJneonblue> when they had they're little 2 second spots all around the dancing hub ball whatever thing
<pony_1311> people who "clop" to mlp start threads about who can fap to the most unfappable picture
<Brony2you> I mean if you think logically they would never do a like pinkshy or twijack ever, cause its a kid show.
<Gorbash> pffthahaha
<Polydunami> one two three
<DJneonblue> *puts on hipster glasses*
<justwannahavefun> Oooh, so you've been there right from the start?
<pony_1311> and people will post pictures they belive are unfappable
<Bane_Kai> :P
<idontevenknow> That would be 4chan
<brusselsprout> two two four
<TWISTeD398> gimme a break, it's 6:30AM
<repony> hey
<Lovs2smuge> 6_9
<pony_1311> is the video working for anyone?
<Bane_Kai> yeah
<Lovs2smuge> lies
<pony_1311> just asking
<bugeyes8> I came back to history
<Vivix> yeah-
<Lovs2smuge> it's 11:39
<Cyrix_-> how do you guys like that song?
<bugeyes8> What?
<LaQuack> gosh that just sounds...awful
<DJneonblue> well, I wouldn't say there, I didn't get really into the show until much later
<idontevenknow> there is no video yet
<repony> 330AM
<Brony2you> Btw, my bets on this episode ending with big mac "staying" in love with cheerlie
<pony_1311> ok
<DJneonblue> but that fascination was there right when I saw it
<Bane_Kai> oh sush you
<String_Shredder> its Loading Screen: the movie
<brusselsprout> two, eight, makes no difference to me.
<fluttershy_123> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/585/8f74fca625bb3b6b2552f98.jpg/
<DJneonblue> I was like WHAT IS THAT SHOW!?!?!
<Vivix> Cheerilee is so cute-
<Ictiv> 12:40
<pony_1311> did fosters home for imaginary friends get a movie?
<Brony2you> fucking love homestuck bro :D
<Gorbash> Well the sun is trying to be subtle in its operations today
<DJneonblue> yes
<LaQuack> yes
<Gorbash> But I see it
<DJneonblue> it had like 3
<Lovs2smuge> indeed
<Vivix> It's a bit too metally for me
<Brony> nice
<pony_1311> fuck yes
<CanadianSinna> lol I became a brony in November
<Sugar-Rush> Hi
<Lovs2smuge> even here i can see it
<idontevenknow> i remember that show
<LaQuack> same
<Lovs2smuge> a rarity
<brusselsprout> hey wait, weren't the normans french?
<justwannahavefun> The very first thing I saw was the Ponycraft 2 video, and after watching that I instantly watched the first 6 episodes.
<Gorbash> trying to rise without me noticing
<Cyrix_-> its fan music from the book
<Kane> should change your nick
<String_Shredder> i got pinkie
<Sugar-Rush> Sorry I havn't been saying much
<Vivix> I like loud angry music, but I like broken guitars and burnt amplifiers when I do
<idontevenknow> Art of the Dress turned me into a brony
<brusselsprout> oh wait nvm
<Vivix> mm Havent read the book
<Gorbash> heh
<pony_1311> I ask because the great and powerful lauren faust was one of the leads on that show
<Ouroboros> Understandable that you dont like brusselsprouts Charles, generally they're not cooked very well, but even then about half of people apparently have a particular gene mutation that results in brussle sprouts having a bitter taste.
<Ictiv> Celestia is planing something?
<Cyrix_-> dooooooeetttttt
<mariomarc> how many hours is it till the episode starts?
<LaQuack> i was looking up what the hell was dubstep and i stumbled onto rainbow dash dubstep
<pony_1311> I wonder how many shows on the hub got movies
<Skitsmore> Wait, What are we talking about?
<justwannahavefun> Which is odd, because I didnt watch cartoons that much. I was a fan of Samurai Jack and Dexter's Lab and that's it.
<Gorbash> most likely
<repony> DOES ANYONE GET STUCK WITH THE rendering icon
<Polydunami> About three
<DJneonblue> OH
<DJneonblue> GOOD
<DJneonblue> GOD!
<Charles> I guess it's just a matter of opinion and taste
<Bane_Kai> stream is down
<DJneonblue> can you imagine the uproar...
<Polydunami> Three and a half>
<pony_1311> I know the hub is new but does anyone know if any of the shows got a movie yet?
<Polydunami> ?
<String_Shredder> wat r u guys debating?
<Charles> Except when it comes to brussel sprouts, because you aren't human duh
<repony> oh thx\
<fluttershy_123> love brussle sproutd
<Bane_Kai> do not fret
<Skitsmore> ._.
<DJneonblue> when the first MLP FIM MOVIE COMES OUT!?!
<Gorbash> Well, they have approximately 3 hours to get it back up
<pony_1311> it will
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So glad you all are behaving still :3
<Plotbuster> it's gonna be magical
<Bane_Kai> eyup
<brusselsprout> :3
<pony_1311> just like we should have known derpy was gonna get her own cannon
<Lovs2smuge> and theres other sites if they dont
<justwannahavefun> Hmmm, somehow I cant imagine that happening right now.
<bugeyes8> Nothing to see here slash ajlie
<fluttershy_123> :D
<Gorbash> Good Luck, brave Bronystate
<Lovs2smuge> indeed

<pony_1311> octavia will be at the next grand galloping gala
<LaQuack> well maybe they could do an adventure episode where they meet seaponies?
<pony_1311> hopefully alongside lyra

<LaQuack> like somewhat what they did when they showed cloudsdale
<mariomarc> no video for me either
<pony_1311> I have yet to see a fanmade seapony that looked good
<TWISTeD398> it feels like the render circle is staring into my soul
<Ictiv> I have one problem with that
<repony> thx
<Gameman246> Oh god, Linkin Park. They used to be my fav.
<pony_1311> vinyl may be at the next grand galloping gala

<Lovs2smuge> and anything else i can find
<justwannahavefun> Or: they meet with ALIENS who want to colonize them. The ponies suddenly invent gunpowder/synthetic fuel and build a massive army and battle it out with the Aliens. Directed by Michael Bay.

*String_Shredder explodes "directed by Micheal Bay"
<Vivix> more open minded musically I guess

<pony_1311> but it would be better if mlp was on nick
<Skitsmore> Or a brony..
<repony> stupid ads
<Gorbash> Also, if anyone sees some "new" cereal called Krave on the store shelves
<Sugar-Rush> Waiting and texting my friends (they can't stay up as late as me, unfortunatley)
<DJneonblue> or the pony gods will be angered
<pony_1311> or cartoon network
<Brony2you> and all you had to say was "daft punk" and he understood completely
<Evil> Because there's nothing streaming
<Kane> lol
<Rainbow_Dashin> Oh.
<Gorbash> Skip it
<Awsum> The screen is suposto be black.... right?
<Sirrus> I haven't been keeping up with much besides Antipodes now that I'm done with FoE. Any good suggestions?
<Vinyl_Sratch> wouldnt miss it for the world
<Lovs2smuge> it's been here for ages
<Kane> *amused*

<Lovs2smuge> with plenty of sugar
<Brony2you> However most people that were like me would skateboard all day and shit

<Gorbash> cousin rejected it
<Bane_Kai> I miss Crispix

<repony> no
<DJneonblue> yeah
<LaQuack> no ryan but i have a more serious case of the fell
<Gameman246> I'd have no idea.
<pony_1311> then we started talking about why we won't see a big movie like spongebob squarepants the movie
<brusselsprout> love this song to death
<Gameman246> Lol
<Rainbow_Dashin> It's too good...

<DJneonblue> I mean not all bronies are creepy like that
<Lovs2smuge> yer
<Lovs2smuge> sounds good
<Rainbow_Dashin> This is why all fluttershy shipper are dicks.
<pony_1311> but the DVD's will sell like hotcakes
<Sugar-Rush> Exactly what happens to me every Saturday night
<Vivix> I think shes gay, she sings about girls, ALOT
<tr00per7> fox whO?
<badger> If there is a movie it better still have the same animation and bull shit cgi
<Rainbow_Dashin> Fluttershy is good on her own.
<DJneonblue> FOX news
<Dragonshy> First time I've done the stream
<Rainbow_Dashin> With the animals.
<Ryanlauph> The Live show was an absolute horror
<Block_Comment> I'm gonna be honest, I just came for the company, I always watch the ep on 1080 later in the day. Later ponyfolk.
<badger> and no*
<repony> umm unhealthy much?
<Gorbash> It's got all the makings of comfort food
<Lovs2smuge> ricicles nice
<buy> pony pony pony sawg
<tr00per7> yeah, dont pull a drawn together on us and change the animation to flash
<Direct> hi
<TWISTeD398> sounds like more work than i'm willing to put into a bowl of cereal at 7AM :$
<repony> but might try
<fluttershy_123> pcce out bro
<Lovs2smuge> meh everything i do is unhealthy
<Brony2you> I have returned from interneting...I found this.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UPRnu8rv_IU
<Sugar-Rush> Cool! My first time was the Pound and Pumpkin cake episode
<idontevenknow> its in flash already
<LaQuack> isnt it already flash?
<Brony2you> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/039/shrugging-pinkie-pie.png
<repony> lol
<Sugar-Rush> I love that song!
<Rainbow_Dashin> fluttershy are you on steam?
<Ryanlauph> I think it's flash :P
<Bane_Kai> Geez.... I just had a hot pocket and now I want cereal:|
<tr00per7> well they somewhgat changed to the style making it smoother
<LaQuack> ugh the drawn together movie was dissappointing
<Lovs2smuge> yum here comes teh cooked breakfast
<tr00per7> and it didnt really feel like drawn together
<repony> get some then
<mariomarc> has anyone seen the Pound Puppies reboot?
<fluttershy_123> yuppers
<Gorbash> Considering that it's Rice Krispies, repony, most of the nutrition there is in the milk itself
<Brony2you> I think I am on the weird side of youtube again...
<broniesFTW> fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Phase4> well so far my experiment is working
<Lovs2smuge> indeed
<Vivix> hehehe
<Dragonshy> I found this place via that derpy talking video
<Sirrus> I figure if I can't microwave or easily put it in the oven, it's not something I should be messing around with.. hehe
<Sugar-Rush> No
<tangelo84> I'm sitting here wondering whether I should do the stream
<Lovs2smuge> the rest if cardboard
<Dragonshy> Experiemnt?
<Lovs2smuge> is*
<Rainbow_Dashin> Do you go on Equestria Daily's chat room?
<fluttershy_123> what experiment
<pony_1311> trust me when groundbreaking mlp merch like Movies, and tv-show like plushies and toys. We'll possibly see a season 5
<repony> k idid not know that
<Rainbow_Dashin> on Steam
<pony_1311> maybe even 6
<Bane_Kai> I THINK I WILL!!:[
<MistChaser> Is there something on your screen, or am I the only one with a buffer screen?
<Dragonshy> Go on...
<pony_1311> but it won't end at season 3
<idontevenknow> 9
<Cyrix_> the odd side of youtube
<Cyrix_> great
<Gameman246> Hell, I made a spray for CSS using that shrugging pic, plus a few others :D
<fluttershy_123> no. just made made my steam account yestarsdya
<derpy_pony> no stream here
<Gorbash> hehe
<fluttershy_123> omg i cant type today
<tr00per7> yeah, I do expect to see a load more seasons
<MistChaser> Okay
<Rainbow_Dashin> Ah Ok Fluttershy
<broniesFTW> lol i think i might be the only one here who is playing minecraft
<LaQuack> what if my little dashie was true and we get 8 seasons of pony?!
<Ryanlauph> I guess up until season 5
<Lovs2smuge> hey if you never try frying stuff you'll never learn
<Rainbow_Dashin> Do you have any games on the account?
<DJneonblue> I kinda feel like we also need a better image in the public eye before we start asking for stuff like merch, or movies
<pony_1311> They just need to come out with stuff people actyually wanna buy
<Bane_Kai> ...... brb :|
<pony_5545> nope!
<pony_1311> and not a fluttershy that looks like RBD
<Brony2you> *points at broniesftw* OBJECTION!
<Dragonshy> Well everyone has TF2
<Lovs2smuge> so what's everyones best breakfast?
<repony> has anyone revealed their name before in here?
<tangelo84> I'm in Australia and it's currently 5 to 11 at night. I don't think I'd have much of a tomorrow if I watched it live
<Dragonshy> Assuming it's installed
<derpy_pony> we had a stream 3 hours ago..but then something happened
<Rainbow_Dashin> lol dragonshy
<Ryanlauph> Hm... based on the current situation it's about 5 seasons
<pony_1311> seriously wtf...hasbro
<Lovs2smuge> i dunno
<Cyrix_> i dont have minecraft
<TWISTeD398> paul shuman, have fun
<Phase4> trying to record the stream and chat, computer is to slow for screencapping (and the design of x11 hardly helps) so i'm being clever
<bugeyes8> I'd be up for atacking a tf2 server
<Rainbow_Dashin> I meant have they bought any
<broniesFTW> lol well there is a sever i have in my list that is empty
<repony> like libunao
<Ryanlauph> I know
<DapperJack> best breakfast is pancakes with egg and sausage
<Lovs2smuge> Lewis Carlin, there you g
<Gorbash> Not to my knowledge
<tr00per7> the tescos in my town now is selling ponies, and I feel I have to buy to prove myself
<Lovs2smuge> go
<Sirrus> This is true. I'd say my best breakfast is belgian waffles with a side of bacon.
<Ryanlauph> Their Celestia is pink
<pony_5545> son i am dissapoint
<Dragonshy> In their tongue, she is Dovashiin, DRAGONSHY!
<fluttershy_123> just tf2. this comp cant

<Vivix> but then I played terraria
<Lovs2smuge> eating teh breakfast at the table
<Sirrus> Oh and strawberries powdered with a little sugar.
<DJneonblue> I mean honestly everytime bronies get a TV spot anywhere its a constant cringe
<Vivix> and then I stopped playing games for a while
<Rainbow_Dashin> Fluttershy, What is the email you made with steam?
<derpy_pony> I hope you don't record me saying anything compromising, Phase4
<pony_1311> plus, have you seen how much these hand made plushies are going for on ebay
<Lovs2smuge> like a civilised person
<pony_1311> fucking tons
<Rainbow_Dashin> I got a gift for you for showing me that song
<derpy_pony> please black it out
<Ryanlauph> LOL
<broniesFTW> i would play terraria but it is not compatble with mac
<repony> like A BOSS
<tangelo84> It's so tempting though
<tr00per7> christ

<Sugar-Rush> You can also look for someones name in the side and have a private chat
<DJneonblue> yes 2k

<DJneonblue> I could buy a whole new DJ set up with that
<tr00per7> although must admit, it does look a lot like the real thing
<Dragonshy> Not that I actually would in all likelyhood
<Cyrix_> that was bad
<Brony2you> buahaha
<DapperJack> when i go to the other theaters they tend not to run all the awesome videos this one does
<pony_5545> damn
<Vivix> but I STILL MISS THe modem dialup sound
<matus_the_brony> yep

<Ryanlauph> :| The great and powerful Trixie does not approve of this
<matus_the_brony> that's true

<Gameman246> I was born in 1995...so...yeah...

<DapperJack> it always crashes and i never know why
<Rainbow_Dashin> Nope, Espy
<matus_the_brony> althoug there was this ONE time when they put the G3.5 series :D
<tr00per7> The most expensive thing I bought was that japanese relief hat for 67 british pounds, thats it
<tangelo84> Cheers

<DapperJack> that would be soul scorching
<matus_the_brony> t was :D
<pony_5545> ocarina of time

<tangelo84> I feel slightly less noobish now:)
<Brony2you> Damn you brain! stop making me have nostalgis!
<Rainbow_Dashin> Gonna have to wait for someone to put on youtube to watch it a second time
<StrangeNoise> otoh if the pattern is the same as last week, the itunes release will be out sooner too
<Gorbash> I usually go to the theatre of whoever is this week's pony
<Sugar-Rush> but if you want a proper chat during the show, have a private chat, The comments just fly by when the episode starts
<Rainbow_Dashin> Anyway, where's fluttershy?

<Rainbow_Dashin> Hi Digistar
<Sugar-Rush> Thats all I know
<DapperJack> so she never got to stick out
<LaQuack> ....
<Sirrus> I find it endearing in way. I definitely prefer it to Pinkie, who's a little too spastic for me.
<LaQuack> yes...
<mariomarc> 6_9
<pony_1311> it would cost like 50 dollars orsomething, and parents aren't spending 50 dollars on a plushie
<tangelo84> D:
<Lovs2smuge> i dont get why people need every character to have a episode
<Brony2you> I almost threw my tv out my window when my pure chao died
<Dragonshy> I just clicked on the face next to the chat bar

<DapperJack> this season seems to be a bit Rarity and Rainbow heavy
<Gorbash> It's just the trend that was set by previous episodes
<tangelo84> oh, that's probably quicker
<LaQuack> hey almsot everything comes from there now adays!
<Lovs2smuge> you need a balance
<Lovs2smuge> yer
<Dragonshy> Oops no bracket required :3
<repony> i cant decide
<Sirrus> We
<Brony2you> Cyrix...
<pony_1311> so ur just gonna have to be rich
<Sirrus> 're nearly halfway into the season, give it time
<Gorbash> Each character gets spotlighted on occasion
<Sugar-Rush> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
<tr00per7> well I seen people other crap for higher prices
<DapperJack> i know and i know why they did it like that
<Gorbash> so it was taken as the norm
<Sugar-Rush> Thats them all
<Vivix> PS1 I remember cause a friend had it
<Brony2you> That gave me so much nostalgia...
<Vivix> and we used to play MGS
<Gameman246> I was a MASSIVE fan of Resident Evil.
<Sugar-Rush> And thats what I do as well XD
<pony_5545> ever since meatspin i dont trust random links :\
<pony_1311> for now at least
<Java> if I click on the stream popout it's shown
<Brony2you> lol
<Deca> I study economics.... and i aggree with LaQuack... sadly :/
<pony_1311> maybe japan will help us out, i dunno
<DapperJack> if you think about it, Rarity and Rainbow would cause the most conflict
<bronyPony> pinkie pie is the best
<Vivix> Dont worry, non pg links get you kicked
<Java> but not this one :(
<Gorbash> To be honest, I miss Twilight
<Ouroboros> Erf... Charles, just for you: Baker creates chocolate covered sprouts http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16771677
<DapperJack> just because of their personalities
<Gameman246> Lol, I remember the first time I found meatspin.
<tangelo84> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
<tangelo84> yes it is
<Gorbash> We haven't seen her in a while
<repony> me too
<Gameman246> It was terrifying.
<Java> fluttershy?
<pony_5545> good song bad image
<Charles> ugh why
<Vivix> I was attracted to that kinda guys at the time, so I wasnt freaked out
<Digistar> weird the video isn't playing
<HurrHurr> also youtube doesnt lead to anything like meatspin
<DapperJack> well i am kinda glad they let her take a back seat for awhile
<pony_1311> china*
<Dragonshy> Have some waiting music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoCjaC9Ro0c&feature=channel_video_title
<Rough_Draft> 97. 97. 1997. That makes you six years younger than me. And you wwebsite as on internet. when did I get old?
<Deca> Everything does come from countries that have cheap laybour.
<tr00per7> what does japan know about ponies
<tangelo84> PINKIE IS INDEED BEST PONY
<DapperJack> it is supposed to be about the six not her
<Dragonshy> Bexause there's no stream
<Gorbash> I don't mind the back seat
<DJneonblue> What do you guys think of the public image of "the common brony"
<gerofash> laybour ?
<Sugar-Rush> I'm listening to Pony Swag XD
<Dragonshy> Garghragh
<Dragonshy> etc
<LaQuack> i hate the public image
<bronyPony> :O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
<Charles> quite a trap
<pony_1311> The public image is mixed
<Sugar-Rush> I love Pinkie too!
<tangelo84> fuck yeah rainbowcrash88
<pony_5545> times are changing bud
<Gameman246> I was playing Half Life Deathmatch, then some guy said "Come here for hackz".
<pony_1311> just as it should be
<DapperJack> but you don't want her gone yeah
<Cyrix_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbLibnZzOI&feature=related
<mariomarc> i'm looking at minecraft stuff
<DJneonblue> mixed?
<String_Shredder> honk honk blarg blarg
<gerofash> mixed
<Gorbash> I just wish she'd get to stand in the actual background every once and a while
<Brony2you> *slams head through desk*
<gerofash> aye
<bronyPony> wall of pinkie pie!!!!!!
<Cyrix_> i dont know
<pony_1311> we are neither heros, nor are we the devils minions
<Brony2you> *slams head through floor*
<tr00per7> COnsidering everyones got there own public image of the brony its not consistent
<brusselsprout> chocolate sprouts
<bugeyes8> Blarg blarg honk?
<Cyrix_> how i got here
<tangelo84> lol i was playing this on guitar half an hour ago
<Sugar-Rush> Awww Yeahhh
<Brony2you> *slams head through earth*
<Dragonshy> Does honk mean yes?
<DJneonblue> between what and what? if you dont mind me asking
<Ouroboros> Indeed. Id be most displeased if I bit into a chocolate and discovered it was actually a sprout.
<bugeyes8> honk
<Brony2you> *ends up in equestria*
<Brony2you> :D
<DJneonblue> oh
<String_Shredder> blarg honk blarg
<Dragonshy> It does! Sweet!
<LaQuack> well i never knew why people hated fox so much but then they attacjed mlp!
<Gorbash> instead of fly by cameos
<Dragonshy> I can speak alien!
<Ictiv> Î think season 1 needed to be Twilight heavy becasue she was more or less an outsider still, so she was good to set up the facts about how life in Ponyville and in general works
<bugeyes8> honk
<mariomarc> you guys no about the minecraft mod where you can play as a pony?
<String_Shredder> blarg
<Dragonshy> IKR
<broniesFTW> lo that would be awesome
<Sugar-Rush> I can't wait for the videos to start
<gerofash> you're as sharp as a blunt and bent outta shape tack lad.
<Subscyed> >Inconsistent >Still get flamed.
<Gorbash> I'm probably not making any sense
<DJneonblue> they didn't "attack" mlp
<idontevenknow> Fox news is shit
<Ictiv> not it makes sense to focus on others to balance things out
<Dragonshy> Yeah, mine little pony
<bugeyes8> BLARG.
<tangelo84> i've seen pics
<Ouroboros> For parents to troll their kids I guess.
<Dragonshy> :D
<Ictiv> now it makes*
<Gameman246> I wish that were possible.
<Dragonshy> I've used it
<brusselsprout> chocolate sprouts, some get chocolate others scream and shout
<Rough_Draft> ...actually, now that I think about it, 14 is how old I was when I first got in trouble for stuff I did on the internet...
<Vivix> it would be aweesome If i got turned into a pony on the way
<repony> did fluttershy get an episode yet
<CanadianSinna> FOX is
<bronyPony> i could watch it on cable but dont feel like it
<DJneonblue> they just horrbly misunderstand the subject
<DapperJack> nope
<Deca> A brony to some 1 who does not understand is a creepy guy (Most of the time.) and to those who know the show its a normal guy.
<Gorbash> not really
<String_Shredder> honk blarg blarg honk honk
<Rainbow_Dashin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeMCXKSk5c&feature=related
<Digistar> brace yourselves applejack being ignored again is coming
<Sugar-Rush> I don't paly minecraft, but I've seen ti on youtube (the mod)
<Rainbow_Dashin> IT'S PONY DAY
<Dragonshy> Unfortuneately it makes you look retarded to other players
<DapperJack> I kinda want to see her bear grappling abilities again
<Sugar-Rush> *it
<pony_1311> Most of all we are looked at as a trend
<CanadianSinna> lol O meant FOX is a comedy I think
<DJneonblue> exactly
<pony_1311> just a trend guys
<tr00per7> I just cant stand some american news places, it just doesnt feel like their just giving you the news
<gerofash> how dare you call fox news? I got family that is news and you insulted them all !
<repony> noooooooooooo
<Inquisitor> People hate fox news because they use the term "Fair and Balanced" when they're rightwing nutballs
<Gameman246> I dunno Vivix, I quite like having fingers.
<Subscyed> Ehhh... People who don't understand or bother to, prefer to rage.
<Arebear> :D
<LaQuack> attacked slandered w/e
<Digistar> gotta get down on pony day
<Ictiv> In this season? nope, but she was in a song
<DJneonblue> I mean there is plenty of NORMAL bronies we arent all freaky
<TWISTeD398> well it used to be that twilight was the one who had to learn about friendship, now it's everyone
<Ouroboros> Those are raw sprouts too.
<Vivix> I do too but if i were to go to equestia--as a huuman?
<Dragonshy> Well, technically last week she had too much attention
<Brony2you> Fuck fingers
<n1ghtmar3> Applejack makes me thirsty
<DapperJack> I seriously had my jaw drop when that happened
<Vivix> It wouldnt turn out well
<DJneonblue> take that MMA guy on youtube for example
<Brony2you> if I get to meet fluttershy at the cost of fingers
<Arebear> Fluttershy friday was yesterday
<broniesFTW> i wonder what would happen if some one got transported to equestria and ended up in ponyvill
<Brony2you> hell Ill do it
<DapperJack> like a physical shock
<Gorbash> I see this season as taking a look at characters who had little say in the previous season
<Subscyed> mmhmm
<pony_1311> Fox news is just trying to appeal to a mass audience
<gerofash> speak for yourself iam halfway between crazy and
<Gameman246> Sure it would. Just find Fluttershy and she'll take care of you :D
<Dragonshy> I can't watch ponies on tv at all here :(
<bronyPony> old republics down and ponys are 2 hours off. sad day
<Digistar> her spotlight did get taken by derpy
<String_Shredder> sweetiebelle saturday
<Dragonshy> ToRs down?
<DapperJack> well the thing is
<pony_1311> I garuantee you at least one person who works for fox news is a brony
<Vivix> hehehe
<Dragonshy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<DapperJack> why are they running the episodes together though?
<mariomarc> i can only watch reruns
<brusselsprout> I helped make apple cider once! hard work, but deliciouser than you could imagine...
<Dragonshy> Of all the worst things that could've happened
<Dragonshy> This is
<DJneonblue> and me, I'm a professional break/hip hop dancer and DJ... were cool people!
<Dragonshy> THE
<Dragonshy> WORST
<Headspiner> i talk to meself
<bugeyes8> For some reason when i giggle at the ghosties it turns into a maniacal laugh
<DapperJack> i mean we have two aj episodes in a row
<Dragonshy> POSSIBLE
<bronyPony> yeah
<Sugar-Rush> I can catch them if i wake up early for school
<DJneonblue> lol
<Dragonshy> THING!
<broniesFTW> lol because fluttershy is best poy
<Sugar-Rush> But only re runs
<tr00per7> he did the research into the names of the ponies
<Vivix> yeaah-
<Phase4> wow, there are alot of join/part messages
<Starlightloveeee> Hi!!
<Subscyed> If you think about it, everyone has some degree of insanity
<DapperJack> and rainbow had two in a row and so on
<broniesFTW> pony
<Brony2you> Indeed she is :3
<gerofash> I talk to my other selfs all the time
<Gameman246> Fluttershy is definitely best pony.
<Arebear> Ursa Major monday
<pony_1311> yeah, everyone is crazy
<Gorbash> Yeah, I'm not too fond of that choice either
<fluttershy_123> i hate when my firned wanders into the wierd part of youtube and kee[s sending me vids
<DapperJack> i'm just wondering why they ran it like that and not mix it up
<repony> like two rainbowdash shows too
<gerofash> and iam everyone of you
<Brony2you> 3 hours everypony
<Subscyed> Matter of how crazy.
<Dragonshy> Really? Oh I guess your on an actual IRC client thing
<tangelo84> geez guys, you could've let Dragonshy finish the bit
<Brony2you> ish
<Sugar-Rush> WHY MEEEEEE? WHYYYY?
<bronyPony> im in college so no class
<pony_1311> lol
<GordonFreemane> Insanity is like gravity, all it needs is a little push.
<Subscyed> I like "batshit" as a measure.
<Brony2you> Hmm
<repony> crap
<Starlightloveeee> 
<Thunderponi> People stop saying "hurr I'm slightly insane" if you think you're insane it means you aren't insane
<LaQuack> well i only saw the one where they said being a brony was a mental condition
<Cyrix_> oh god im on the﻿ dark side of youtube again
<Headspiner> i talk to me computer and tea cup and all the other items around me
<Brony2you> I have a new nostalgic topic
<Ouroboros> Indeed Phase4, personally I disabled them in my IRC client
<Ryanlauph> I guarantee you at least one person in every country in the world is a brony... yes even nations in Africa
<Brony2you> Kingdom hearts 2
<bronyPony> can watch it whenever
<repony> sry slow typer
<Gameman246> I've been here for an hour then :D
<gerofash> well see this universe is actually a figment of my immagination and you're all aspects
<Thunderponi> An insane person does not know he/she's insane
<Sugar-Rush> Sorry, I didn't realise until I submitted, and then I felt bad.
<Digistar> i've got a naturaly creepy,maniacal laugh
<DJneonblue> lol, well I have an insane side to a point, I just dont think that the pony loving side of me is anywhere near that
<Starlightloveeee> applejack ~ 
<Dragonshy> You should do
<Dragonshy> :3
<Brony2you> Anyone?
<tr00per7> scrw your imagination
<Gameman246> I never played that actually. I played the first though.
<TWISTeD398> 6_9
<Cyrix_> OMG
<Niceguy00007> /join #BattlelogBronies
<Inquisitor> there not a stream up right now?
<Gorbash> Though, now that I think about it, it may have to do with the episodes themselves
<tangelo84> crusaders just finished for me, have some more music
<tangelo84> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voj9MhBUaTI
<tr00per7> my imagination is better
<Subscyed> Erm, they do Thunderponi.
<Cyrix_> THE KEY BLADE
<Dragonshy> We
<Brony2you> :D!
<tangelo84> loving this atm
<Cyrix_> I KNOW THIS
<Dragonshy> oops
<bugeyes8> I can't laugh without launching into diabolica laughter
<Thunderponi> No
<DJneonblue> it shouldn't be "insane" or crazy to like show
<Thunderponi> No they don't
<gerofash> only because i immagined it to be !
<Brony2you> I love kh2 :3
<Subscyed> They do to some extent
<Headspiner> i dont have imagination
<DapperJack> im thinking it might be their animation schedule
<Gameman246> Sephiroph. That is all.
<Inquisitor> or am I just everyday 'm bufferin?
<Dragonshy> No inq, there's not
<Gorbash> Even though they're branded as -insert character- episodes
<Cyrix_> i think i still have it
<Digistar> neither can i
<Subscyed> Only if they're too far in they don't realise it, then, they don't
<DapperJack> they said it was hectic and it might be easier to focus on a character at a time
<Sugar-Rush> Sorry about that
<Inquisitor> lol k thx
<bugeyes8> *High five*
<Thunderponi> An insane person will see themselves as normal and think what they're doing isn't wrong or deviant
<Gorbash> They don't always focus on that character
<Rainbow_Dashin> Scootaloo Saturday.
<Arebear> :D
<LaQuack> gosh i finally caught up to the chat
<broniesFTW> did any one play pokemon?
<Arebear> :(
<bugeyes8> We could take over the world together!
<Subscyed> Then again, not all alcoholics admit to being alcoholic. (Not comparing)
<Dragonshy> :O
<Gorbash> as much as the description implies, that is
<Lovs2smuge> hmm
<Arebear> :)
<LaQuack> my eyes!
<DapperJack> i know im just wondering if it is the schedule though
<Digistar> everyday im buffering too
<Gameman246> I played Pokemon Blue.
<Thunderponi> It's part of how you define insanity
<Sugar-Rush> but yeah... No ponies for me unless i wake up at around 6 - 6:30
<Dragonshy> 6_9
<Arebear> :3
<pony_1311> VinylXOctavia guys! Allegrezza is a shipping fanfinc I think every brony should read
<Gameman246> Not very much though
<DJneonblue> true
<Cluttershuy> Good morning everypony

<pony_1311> moring pony :D
<bronyPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1O0ErRhdoI this is better
<bugeyes8> :/
<Subscyed> Well, granted. But it isn't that far-out twisted.
<Digistar> :)
<brusselsprout> or at least a suburban area where there wouldn;t be much resistance. We could take over that.
<Headspiner> gewd morning
<Ware> It's 11pm here
<tr00per7> god damnit
<LaQuack> mornin!
<Quin2> ive had my coffee and im def gonna make it to new episode!

<Herpderp> Morning.
<Dragonshy> :3
<Thunderponi> Mornan'
<Deca> Heya

<badger> hey :)
<Vivix> We dont celebrate halloween here-
<Headspiner> even though its 2 pm here
<tr00per7> are there no heterosexuals in equestira
<bugeyes8> I;ve got the laugh
<Subscyed> Ohai dar
<tangelo84> can't argue with that
<Brony2you> Organization 13! WOO! :D
<Vivix> or well, not when I was in my teens
<Gorbash> and then the following episode was more about Tank
<fluttershy_123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwiv_Bt3-c&list=PL135BC4EC53F0CEA5&index=1&feature=plpp_video this is one of my fav pony songs
<Vivix> Its slowly becmoing popular now
<Sugar-Rush> XD true
<LaQuack> rarity is hetero right?
<pony_1266> Hiya
<Gorbash> even though Rainbow held a key role
<Cluttershuy> Can't believe I wasn't here when derpy talked
<SticktheFigure> Meanwhile, in ridiculous land, I've been up for 24 hours. I hope I don't give up in the little time that's left.
<Brony2you> Great... now I have becoming popular stuck in my head...
<Cluttershuy> Oh well, the youtube video was hilarious enough
<Deca> Shame :/
<tangelo84> do you think that'll be in the episode where someone doesn't like Pinkie?
<DJneonblue> no heterosexuals in equestria?
<Inquisitor> Derpy has the same VA as Rarity...
<Vivix> I love that soong
<Brony2you> and Im happy with it...
<pony_2718> same
<broniesFTW> lol my friend jail broke my ipod so i got a bunch of game boy advanced games on there
<Oatmeal> Is it just me, or is something being streamed that i cant see?
<tr00per7> well the fan fics
<Arebear> I think the Art of the dress one was better :/
<DapperJack> stick you might want to take it easy then
<CanadianSinna> what about mr and mrs cake?
<Herpderp> My intial reaction was O.o
<Brony2you> just you
<DJneonblue> ture
<Subscyed> Derpy was mistaken for a colt.
<Vivix> noo its off
<Digistar> :P
<Gameman246> Nothing's being streamed.
<bronyPony> if they dont likke pinkie i will end them.
<pony_5545> three months of winter coolness and awesome holidays
<Subscyed> *RAGE*
<Phase4> does anyone know where the option to remove join/part messages is in xchat?
<Thunderponi> ^
<DJneonblue> true*
<Ware> I'm just here because 1: I'm up and 2: I want to see what people post during
<Sugar-Rush> I have to stay up all night to catch the livestram, but I don't mind, because i STAY UP LATE ANYWAYS.

<Digistar> nope.avi
<repony> night
<Thunderponi> I found the voice fitting though
<Vivix> my facourite s2 song is probablyyy--find a pet
<pony_1311> still a girly voice though
<Gorbash> Applejack didn't have a heavy presence last week, as the show was stolen by almost everyone else
<tangelo84> I thought it would be in Hearth's Warming, then in Baby Cakes, now I'm just hoping, not expecting
<Sugar-Rush> I hope so.
<SticktheFigure> Indeed. I took a 5 hour energy against my better judgement at 2 to help me finish a vectoring, but now I'm worried I'll die.
<tr00per7> I keep thinking were talking about guns
<pony_1311> for a boy at least
<Dragonshy> FAREWELL!!!!
<Sugar-Rush> kk

<Gameman246> Don't even mention that browser.
<Brony2you> YEEEESSSSSS
<brusselsprout> something humans do
<Ryanlauph> :S
<Digistar> what is this eating you speak of
<DapperJack> im just wondering because his was the two most controversial
<Headspiner> i dont want to mix horror/death/ect with MLP
<bugeyes8> That's weird
<brusselsprout> it's nonsense.
<tangelo84> does anyone know Pinkie Guy (needsmoredjent)? He's headlining, apparently, and I really want to go
<Ware> Quick question
<DapperJack> Over a Barrel and Pinkie Sense
<Deca> Go listen to em on Youtube then brah. :p
<pony_1311> The best fanfics are the ones about BG ponies
<LaQuack> suck at reading? you just read this!
<brusselsprout> pay it no mind.
<Sugar-Rush> Awesome
<Fazana> My imagination is really crazy, yet bad 6_9
<Brony2you> Ahh.. that was another part of my childhood ;p
<Digistar> whats a human?
<String_Shredder> silly humans
<Ware> is the screen for the stream meant to be just loading
<tr00per7> because after a while I stop reading and im just saying the word loudly in my head but im not thinking what the hells going on
<pony_1311> because BG ponies have a clean slate
<Headspiner> both things will be ruined for me then
<TWISTeD398> yes
<Ware> ot is it just my computer?
<Ryanlauph> I hate how there's no :Applejack: emoticon
<Arebear> CelticBrony needs to be here :(
<DapperJack> yes

<pony_1311> and your prior conseption of ponies are most likely to tarnish any fanfic that includes them as mane characters
<Vivix> I dont think I can post nega
<ScootaChicken> actually no, I'm not really sad because the movies sucked
<repony> least your comp is not flickering
<Butterfly_Pony> Hi Scootachicken

<pony_1311> but god that's 1:15 of nonstop pony goodness
<Cyrix_> you should send it to me
<kevinsano> yes
<repony> well crap
<brusselsprout> Humans (known taxonomically as Homo sapiens, Latin for "wise man" or "knowing man" are the only living species in the Homo genus.
<kevinsano> like that
<Ware> Stick
<bugeyes8> Up, and My little Dashie.
<Ware> here is a method
<Bane_Kai> Phase4: ping.

<Fazana> yay...
<pony_1311> instead of just 22
<d3rb> is the stream playing anything atm or down for all?
<Ryanlauph> It's as bad as Sweetie Belle cooking :S
<Rainbow_Dashin> Chrome Crashed
<Sugar-Rush> Sorry about that XD It's just my Ponyona's name
<Rainbow_Dashin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeMCXKSk5c&list=PL3551304C11D8F6EC&feature=plpp_play_all
<String_Shredder> not witchcraft Digistar, im just half human
<bronyPony> i dont have much to spend my money on
<Ware> Tried splashing water and rubbing it in your eyes?
<tangelo84> Does anyone remember that 10-minute Trixie epic on EqD a couple of months back? That was him, and had everything from death metal to dubstep in the one track
<Sugar-Rush> It's down for me
<Phase4> Bane_Kai, yup
<Deca> You don't need a movie when you got awsome fan made music in the background ^^
<Pinkie980> immma bored

<Ware> Hmmmn
<tangelo84> stream is down
<Fazana> Well you got 2.75 hours yet
<Arebear> My little dashie mad me depressed for about 2 weeks.
<Ware> Oh?
<Pullaolli> :(
<Digistar> ahh i see makes more sense than witchcraft
<Inquisitor> I liked Up, but only the beginning... the movie after the dude's wife died was a let down
<badger> thanks bro :)
<Gameman246> I kinda wish I was born earlier, sounds like I missed a lot of music and tech stuff I would've loved :P
<d3rb> sweet
<Ouroboros> It was rather disapointing, B movies dont have to be bad, just not really mainstream.
<SticktheFigure> Don't worry about me. I'll complain, but I'm sure I'll be fine.
<Deca> Eurobeat Brony - Discord (The Living Tombstone's Remix)

<Bane_Kai> ENGLISH DOGFARTS!!! WOOO!
<Ryanlauph> Omfg the Italian opening was mindblowing
<ScootaChicken> the thing is Starflash, I had to remember the entire thing for a test I had in half an hour
<Gameman246> I joined early just so I could watch the randomly streamed vids, like I did last week. I had a ball then :P
<Brony> :)
<Pwnies> Hey guys, watch this and if it doesn't make you smile then you have no soul
<Vivix> satirical song about punks

<Pwnies> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
<Phase4> now onward to reading
<Deca> xD
<pony_1311> they just bob their heads awkwardly
<Vinyl_Sratch> well we just need to remember were all hooved at the end of each leg
<indeable> ki
<Ware> so they ask 'how did you do it?'
<pony_1311> @Ryan I KNOW!
<Phase4> be back for the episode
<tangelo84> i know the smileys now and i'm gonna use 'em!
<Brony> yh lol
<Vivix> yeahh- maybe someone will do that today
<pony_1311> is that the real opening?
<Starflash> Was it a presentation or something o.o
<Deca> Every one knows
<Sugar-Rush> I don't mind language, if it's me you're worried about. Certain people in my class have very colourful language XD
<Ware> and he says 'me not stupid me not dumb me stick cork up dogies bum'
<bronyPony> i draw schems and do alot of math
<Ryanlauph> I think so!
<Ware> That's about it
<ScootaChicken> nope Starflash, we had to write an essay
<pony_1311> nucking futs!
<NotYourAverageBrony> Im still debating on if I want to wait and see if the live stream is up in 2 1/2 hours... or just sleep...
<Derpy_Hooves> It is actually, thats just the extended version
<Shrimp3000> So does anyone know when the stream will be up?
<NotYourAverageBrony> ideas?
<Pwnies> oh....
<Perfson> Phase4, but... but... a'm ukrainian !! :)
<ScootaChicken> if it was a presentation then I would be horribly screwed
<Ryanlauph> It uses clips from season 2
<Pwnies> bubum...... tsch/
<Ryanlauph> what did they use for season 1
<LaQuack> the italian version sounded like an anime opening
<Ryanlauph> ?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FVqFN_Hn20
<Arebear> Sleep < Ponies
<Sugar-Rush> I'll be right back, just looking at the BronyconAU video.
<Starflash> ScootaChicken: why? pronounciation?
<bronyPony> its easy and can do it from home
<Vivix> "I watch the others and act like them, I'm a non comformist"
<Derpy_Hooves> thats the shorter one
<Ware> Oh and the first two were
<Rough_Draft> Come pick my roses~
<ScootaChicken> eeyup
<Ryanlauph> The way they sang it makes it sound Japanese
<Ryanlauph> LOL
<Gameman246> Lawl
<Ware> because he ran out of juice
<LaQuack> omg im getting sick of these links
<Ware> and because he had no guts
<tr00per7> grrrrrr
<Ware> XD
<Pwnies> they are just old
<ScootaChicken> my French pronounciation is really quite lacking
*Rough_Draft dances to some aqua. legit.
<bronyPony> but i dabble in stocks
<pony_1311> how come the italian version sounds like japanese to me?
<mariomarc> lucky
<Ware> I said they were old
<Deca> You don't need to click them :p
<Phase4> Perfson, well google tells me that the language is russian
<tr00per7> those damn japs are not the only ones with the high pitched girly singing intros
<ScootaChicken> that goes for most languages actually...
<tangelo84> jesus... i drop junkmail in letterboxes and am trying to find a better job atm. That's insane how well you're doing
<d3rb> nice
<Starflash> French is pretty easy to pick up in terms of pronounciation though..
<Arebear> Heathrow customs.
<LaQuack> they are so inticing!
<pony_1311> ^ thats why
<Pwnies> WATCH THIS LINK AND LAUGH!
<Vinyl_Sratch> Geez how old are you guys? Im 14 and im wondering if theres anyone my age whos a dedicated brony like myself

<ScootaChicken> I can speak Chinese fluently, but I still say everything in a really British accent
<bronyPony> sucked bad

<Ware> sorry

<Gameman246> Haha, so's mine!
<Vivix> so I grew up with stuff like that in the background
<Inquisitor> Little Known Fact, when you reach the 48 hour mark of lack of sleep your brain will actually shut itself down conciously, it leads to hallucinations
<repony> hey im back
<tangelo84> figured lol
<Deca> Pony cart was so awsome my crome crashed in the begining...
<Ware> -_- I thought we were discussing video's
<Vivix> hehehe

<Vinyl_Sratch> i guess im the only one then
<Gameman246> They did, anyway...
<Inquisitor> time warps are the most common
<d3rb> ep 14 is top 5 material for sure
<Rough_Draft> I'm convinced that Sleep is actually an elder god bent on slowing human progression and keeping us away from seeing pony episodes.
<NotYourAverageBrony> people have woken up covered in blood that wasnt their own.
<Ware> I was talking about a small movie and was actually advertising
*Vivix repairs past tense

<Vivix> as the 90s go, Im into the grunge noise and alternative parts, not the metal really-
<Brony2you> I was watching old 80s videos...what did I miss...Im too lazy to read a wall of text :3

<Cabooselololol> oh ok, thought it was just me :P
<Sugar-Rush> My friends and i are freaking out
<Gorbash> and asks to put ads on your video
<repony> damn
<mariomarc> i think it's just that till the stream starts
<d3rb> its like a lava lamp :P

<d3rb> not really
<Ryanlauph> :| The great and powerful disapproves of you preferring Derpy over the great and powerful Trixie
<LupusStriker> one*
<Ware> I hope repony fires me
<tangelo84> 'cause there was that shitstorm from a few
<Sugar-Rush> No, I loved her. Did you?
<pony_1311> now tell me where you got it from
<tr00per7> hopefully

<Boegela> 18 here
<Vivix> But dubstep in Geeneral has become alittle bit stale-
<Fazana> God

<Fazana> I has TF2
<GordonFreemane> :D
<tr00per7> Tf2 is alright
<Vivix> Deviever was going to make a dubstep pedal for guitar and bass though, maybe shes done
<Gameman246> Maybe the person running it will fix that soon...
<Arebear> :S
<RyunosukeKnT> o/
<tangelo84> damn, no drunk ponies
<Ware> Dapper Jack brisled her Sapphire eyes at her chosen fandom as they swooned over her. She giggled in delight and then decided she would:
<tr00per7> I prefer almands
<Flutterdash> TF2's coo'
<badger> i remeber when i watched the season 1 pilot i was like wtf this cant be my little pony XD
<Phase4> Shrimp3000, i'm from melbourn, you?

<tangelo84> am i the only one who wants to see fluttershy get drunk? or at least tipsy?
<spotty_pony> i can read and understand this chat, but can't talk (bad english) SOOO SAD
<LaQuack> YAY i got respect!
<CanadianSinna> TF2 is a good game indeed
<Ware> well
<DapperJack> lol
<GordonFreemane> TF2 is the #3 video game of all time according to game informer
<Ware> Xd
<Noir> Over the barrel was from season one.
<Fazana> I remember my sister watching G3
<Winter_Shadowhooves> changed name from (Matthew Lindfield)
<AimlessPone> I made the mistake of starting to read a star-6 fanfic, it screwed up my schedule yesterday.
<Deca> ^^
<Evdog> Here's an example of early dubstep: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB2tbU_bM8o&feature=relmfu Nothing like what is it now.
<Flutteryay> im gonna sleep until 9:45...
<bugeyes8> thanks
<Skitsmore> Becuase i'm awesome, Everypony should add me
<Ware> I'm having a cupcakes moment
<Fazana> and I was like "What the hell is that crap"
<Skitsmore> http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.121202707995995.22602.100003187992265&type=3#!/profile.php?id=100003187992265
<Shrimp3000> I'm from a city south of Sydney
<bronyPony> no i fluttershy wouldnt drink i believe
<derpy_pony> - All under 18s must be accompanied by an adult (ideally a parent, guardian or older sibling), and will need to leave the pub by 10pm
<Fazana> which is the main reason I hesitated :)
<Brony> ok take care:P
<tangelo84> yeah, probably not
*Derpy_Hooves flies around
<Ware> so it's probably not a good idea
<Rainbow_Dashin> lol
<Rainbow_Dashin> Someone called Pinkie Pie
<derpy_pony> sounds like fun
<LaQuack> anyone here play dragon nest or vindictus? just wondering...
<DapperJack> i'd recommend a good book then
<Vinyl_Sratch> lucky. here its 4:40
<Winter_Shadowhooves> theres a fanfiction where twilight gets drunk
<SkywardSticks> I should go
<Vivix> Ah yeah, I remember that soortof--my friend liked it
<DapperJack> john dies at the end
<Gameman246> Huh. Atm seems a lot more basic.
<ScootaChicken> Ouroboros, I'm friends with the people in charge of it and there's already been a fairly successful meetup in Trafalgar Square
<SkywardSticks> To london
<Shrimp3000> Anyway, bye.
<Cabooselololol> pinkie would, wonder what sorta drunk she would be?
<Fazana> I used to play Vindictus Beta
<SkywardSticks> Just for that day.
<Pinkie980> fanfic :/
<d3rb> maybe she'll tun into fluterbitch if she drinks
<Perfson> 2:40
<LupusStriker> 11:10pm
<Evdog> Eeyup
<DapperJack> lots of freaky shit in that
<Phase4> Shrimp3000, later
<Vivix> yeah-
<Skitsmore> What was everyponys childhood game?
<Fazana> But then I got some other game
<PinkiePieFTW> please
<Brony> its 6:41am
<ScootaChicken> I'm only 14, which is gonna cause some difficulties
<CanadianSinna> YES DRAGONS NEST
<spotty_pony> i playin DnD in IRL
<derpy_pony> this is next week
<Winter_Shadowhooves> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6856543/1/What_do_you_do_with_a_drunken_unicorn
<Fazana> I forget the name
<derpy_pony> waaah
<PinkiePieFTW> pinkie pie can't get drunk
<Brony2you> Someone does something good someone has to do it better
<littleloup> 4:41 am
<Fazana> Childhood?
<Ware> Not specifically cupcakes
<derpy_pony> not enough time
<Phase4> Shrimp AWAY!
<Vivix> yeah
<Skitsmore> Yes
<String_Shredder> the first Halo
<Ware> I'm not that messed up
<Brony2you> However there is a level to where something can only be so good
<Ryanlauph> One fine Saturday... I was bored stiff. So I browsed YouTube. Then I saw a TV episode. I was like "Hell, why not?" And I watched it. And suddenly, my whole world exploded with joy and laughter. And I watched the entire season 1 in 2 days <3
<Fazana> Um. Simpsons hit and run
<tangelo84> or really pinkie-sh and excitable
<SkywardSticks> Darn.
<Brony2you> once it reaches that
<Sugar-Rush> There's a fanfic where Rarity gets drunk and kisses Applejack... It was.... strange.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> how so?
<ScootaChicken> although I think the person I'm going with is over 18
<Ware> just mostly gore
<Deca> Diable 2 was the first game it got in to <3
<bronyPony> the shes to drunk on joy to notice.
*Molestia pokes Derpy_Hooves
<Brony2you> everyone that tries to be better then that simply fails
<videogame9> Donkey Kong 64.
<Deca> Diablo*
<Fazana> Oh yeah
<Cyrix_> BRB
<Ictiv> okay I think I blacked out somewhere... What fic are you talking about?
<Fazana> I forgot Diablo
<ScootaChicken> although I'm not sure...
<tr00per7> I tried playing warhammer in real life till I realised my family cant play warhammer and the damn instructions is like a few inches thick
<Ware> and maybe a gun or two
*Noir wonders when a meet up will happen in Anchorage AK?
<anonymous> spyro the dragon
<Gameman246> lol true.
<Fazana> That's one of my faves
<Ouroboros> Huge child safeguarding issues if you dont do something like that derpy_pony, better than just banning under 18s outright.
<DapperJack> Cupcakes somewhat
<ChancellorPudinghead> 1:41pm
<Flutterdash> Diablo 2
<Ware> Xd
<Winter_Shadowhooves> im not that keen on shipping fics
<Ictiv> For the life of me I can't find where this topic started
<Phase4> ScootaChicken, would you happen to be using xchat?
<Vivix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWJ32ZF2i0&feature=related First dubstep ive ever heard
<Molestia> SPYRO!
<Flutterdash> No question about it
<DapperJack> there is a mystery science theater 3k version
<Skitsmore> Mine was Rayman, If you've heard of it?
<Gameman246> Anyway, this "old" dubstep ain't bad.
<ScootaChicken> xchat?
<Fazana> Yeah
<String_Shredder> o no... Molestia...
<derpy_pony> yes, sure, Ouroboros
<Molestia> that was the first game I ever bought for my PS
<tr00per7> and I kept repainting the damn space marines red and blue till they were just a mess
<Ware> I wrote a random poem for dapper
<spotty_pony> nopony talk here about Skyrim :3
<LaQuack> monster hunter!
<Ryanlauph> a-A-a-A-a-A-a-A-a.
<badger> pokemon blue!

<Flutterdash> Rayman was pretty good, Sktismore!
<Rainbow_Dashin> At the Winter Gala
<anonymous> still got my spyro
<Subscyed> No arrows or knees here, Spotty.
<Fazana> I would talk about skyrim, but too much danger of getting shot by arrows
<tr00per7> anyone play shogun 2 total war?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> awkward quietness
<ScootaChicken> Phase4, I use ChatZilla

<bronyPony> anyone notice the lack of male ponys that talk
<derpy_pony> I'm old enough to be prime minister anyway...so it's not really my problem
*String_Shredder backs away from Molestia
<Ryanlauph> SuperMario3DLand completed in 5 hours yeaaaa-
<Phase4> ScootaChicken, ah, it does the same as xchat when you autocomplete

<Lucid> Pegasus pony is best pony

<Arebear> Bronies
<tangelo84> your brain isn't such a weird place after all
<Fazana> No, you hunt noobs
<Ware> Dapper awoke from his bed to watch the next episode form my little pony only to see a discord icon on his screen
<Phase4> "Linux 3.2.1-1-ARCH [x86_64/1.20GHz/SMP]"
<justwannahavefun> Oh come on oldies are the best. *Puts on hipster glasses* Like the xcom series, old adventure games like Loom and the Secret of Monkey Island.
<Molestia> ...so to answer your question I don't know
<Lucid> Pegasus
<Winter_Shadowhooves> mine was
<ScootaChicken> you just had to remember that tilde didn't you...
<Vinyl_Sratch> amen
<Cabooselololol> :P
<Ware> He assumed he had a virus so tried to close it
<LupusStriker> again
<Tervicz> Earth ponies!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> XD
<tr00per7> ergh
<Fazana> I have MI2
<badger> yo better not like the 2006 sonic
<Flutterdash> o: Xcom! I haven't played that in like, forever!
<DapperJack> and the monitor exploded
<Winter_Shadowhooves> anyone still scarred from cupcakes?
*Phase4 is so bored
<Sugar-Rush> And in the other, all I can remember is him saying 'I'm pretty sure-' and then Appleblooms saying 'You're pretty sure but not completely sure?"
<Arebear> Bronies
<bronyPony> doctor whooves dressecd as ermac in the halloween ep awesome
<Sugar-Rush> Me
<ColorStorm> Ill be AFK (Away From Keyboard, if you didnt know) until ponies.
<AceExcel> remember m?
<Phase4> someone give me an idea please
<Pinkie980> omg that was scary
<ScootaChicken> y'know Nyria, I'm waiting till you reach my age and turn into a cynical bastard
<Gorbash> Pony is best pony
<Winter_Shadowhooves> that was awfull
<Ware> However a magical portal of magicalness appeared and he was sucked into the world of my little pony
<ScootaChicken> like me
<AceExcel> ME
<JAC97> yes
<Ryanlauph> :[ 2006 SONIC WAS AWFUL, JUST AWFUL
<repony> he sucked in
<spotty_pony> Sonic Generations is boring
<Sugar-Rush> I drew fanart
<videogame9> Oh yeah, I remember now. I liked Superman 64.
<Fazana> I used to play pokeymans, but then I got bored and stopped :3
<tr00per7> man call of duty is sweet, its a brillaint game. My favourite was cod 3, I loved playing that game with the tanks and motorbikes
<Pinkie980> the video was heaps scary
<Winter_Shadowhooves> oh god
<Evdog> I'd like to hear Glitch Rock music, but no one seems to make it. Every time I search for it, I get results about some Black Ops rock glitch.
<Rough_Draft> red delicious, pink lady, fuji, honeycrips, gala, braeburn, mcintosh, jazz...
<String_Shredder> :trollface: action 52
<pony_4680> is the video playing for u guys?
<JAC97> i want superman 64
<GordonFreemane> Anypony else find Call of Duty overrated?
<repony> got
<Sugar-Rush> but I am still creeped out
<Headspiner> never played sonic games!
<bugeyes8> I'm sixteen and a cynical bastard
<videogame9> yes
<JAC97> and action 52
<Ware> Extqatic and thuroughly feaked out, he headed to Twilightws house to find only Flutterbitch residing
<tangelo84> it was fucked up, but i think i'm too desensitised from horror movies to call myself "scarred"
<Ryanlauph> :'( But I like Sonic Generations
<Nyria> And apperently 6 months can do that to a person~
<Fazana> Overrated = bad?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Gilda deserved it though
<Skitsmore> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Js3nXKuErg&feature=fvwrel <----- This was my great childhood hero, Now he's awesome as fuck
<anonymous> cheetamen
<Ware> "Oh boo hoo"
<ScootaChicken> eeyup
<justwannahavefun> Did you know that there is an Xcom remake in the wroks?
<Arebear> Im 12, what is this?
<Phase4> ScootaChicken, what age do you turn cynical?
<Vivix> hehe
<Quin2> 2 hours
<Vivix> Glitchy rock music?
<Cabooselololol> Cupcakes wasent so bad to me, creepy, but not scary
<Gameman246> Haha, CoD.
<JAC97> oif any1 got a coppys of those games ill buy them
<Sugar-Rush> True that
<Flutterdash> Ye
<Ware> She replied to his questions
<Quin2> and 15 minutes
<Vivix> sounds like a good idea
<badger> original sonics are best sonics
<Ictiv> Aw :(
<Fazana> I'm not fond of CoD or Battlefield
<brusselsprout> I'm a cynical optomist
<Sugar-Rush> but poor Twist :(
<ColorStorm> Arebear: Lol
<mariomarc> no, no she didn't
<Fazana> if I wanna play an FPS, it's Quake.
<Quin2> i am going to fucking make it
<tangelo84> did anyone see that video with the dancing?
<CanadianSinna> What u talk1ng b0ut dud3 c0d is S1CK
<Ictiv> Dapper is stuck in Equestria, how will we talk with him?
<ScootaChicken> Phase4, 13 and 3 quarters, I'm 14 now
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yes
<Vivix> you could check out avant garde, no wave, noise and stuff though
<Pinkie980> yeah my boyfriend said that he got scared of cupcakes more than saw
<fluttershy_123> random chat is random
<tangelo84> 'cause i found that disturbingly hilarious
<Vivix> some of that is glitchy
<DapperJack> through telekinesis
<Winter_Shadowhooves> the 100% cleaner version
<ScootaChicken> 14 and a half actually...
<badger> hahahaha ^
<Brony2you> Remember when I said that if something is good
<Ware> However suddenly Rainbow dash came in and put a rin on her, quickly followed by rainbow jack.
<Ryanlauph> :D LOL CoD is sick, you so random CanadianSinna
<JAC97> I GOT AN ORIGINAL ATARI 2600 IM 14 SCREW GREAT GRAPHICS
<Pinkie980> the song is great
<Headspiner> if i want to play a FPS i play halo combat evolved or half life 2
<Sugar-Rush> No
<Deca> Gta 2 on PS1 or War of the mosters on PS2... good times.
<Brony2you> and it someone perfects it
<Ictiv> DapperJack: Telepathy?
<brusselsprout> random for the random god?
<Sugar-Rush> May I have a link?
<GordonFreemane> Let's put a smile on dat faec.
<Flutterdash> *Yeah, I'm not too fuzzed about it, though, justwannahavefun. It feels like it's gonna be more like Mass Effect or something rather than Xcom
<LaQuack> what ever happened to megaman?
<Ware> "Just how in tarnation did you get out of that cage missy?"
<Winter_Shadowhooves> the song is pretty cool
<Phase4> ScootaChicken, huh, i'm 18 and that never happened. i must be broke
<repony> a computer
<DapperJack> yup
<Brony2you> then others try and fail. This was the guy that perfected it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8xmjh_H9Mno
<Gameman246> Everything else falls short, we get it.
<JAC97> megaman is hard shit
<ScootaChicken> probably.
<Colt_Magnum> is anyone seeing nothing?
<Gameman246> Lol
<Fazana> Megaman was good
<Lucid> I think you mean telepathy Dapper. Telekenesis wouldn't be very helpful
<Ictiv> Telekinesis is moving distant objects
<Ware> "Bitching, I borrowed pinki pie's abilities
<Flutterdash> Megaman got cancer and died :(
<Brony2you> and my perfected, I mean created the dirtiest drop of all time
<Ware> "
<DapperJack> lol
<Pinkie980> the video is flagged
<fluttershy_123> im 16
<badger> :(
<JAC97> shit as in good sorry
<Skitsmore> Did anypony have muppet racing?
<Sugar-Rush> Awkward silence XD

<DapperJack> yeah i form words in the show
<GordonFreemane> Heath Ledger died :(
<ScootaChicken> mind you, ever since I became a brony I've become a lot less pessimistic
<Sugar-Rush> Cool
<tr00per7> stupid little kid took too many plasma bullets to the cranium
<Cabooselololol> really? flagged?
<Colt_Magnum> anypony here from the bioware pony thread?
<justwannahavefun> Wait, there are 2 Xcom remakes WIP.
<Vivix> especially in art and music
<DapperJack> and you guys watch it and respond
<Arcadian> Is anyone getting anything to show up on the stream?
<GordonFreemane> This makes Fluttershy sad.
<Phase4> ponies tend to do that
<Fazana> No, the only racing games I have is Burnout and f1
<DapperJack> using branches etc
<tangelo84> the song is great
<JAC97> heath legend what when
<ScootaChicken> eeyup
<bugeyes8> I can be an optimist and cynical
<Headspiner> :(
<tr00per7> good, make fluttershy sad
<Brony2you> True
<Colt_Magnum> arcadian nope, im blind as buck
<Subscyed> Keep up the optimistic work! :3
*String_Shredder hides under random bed "Molestia cant find me here"
<GordonFreemane> NO
<tr00per7> she doesnt deserve happiness!
<Flutterdash> Oh? I didn't knw about the second one
<LaQuack> look at the countdown
<Gameman246> With Art, it's pretty opinionated.
<tangelo84> same guy that did party hard :D
<Digistar> people keep calling me pinkie pie because of the way i act :$
<DapperJack> Hi Guy's
<Brony2you> but just listen to the drop

<Brony2you> before you say that
<brony-Pony> who jacked my name?
<Brony2you> ;P
<Sugar-Rush> I'll brace myself xD
<Subscyed> Then again... A pessimist to an optimist is a realist...
<Amras0000> oh, I see
<DapperJack> Can you believe this shit
<Ware> Thuroughly confused, Dapper stood there and managed to ask "What the hell is going on" Ensuring not to go down to flutterbitch's lever with swearing
<Deca> Chat..going...so...fast....
<Gameman246> Waiting...
<fluttershy_123> fluttershy is best <3
<Inquisitor> Cynicisim is a mental tap to show your level of empathy
<Ryanlauph> I used to like Megaman... then I took a Capcom to the knee ;)
<ScootaChicken> I like to think I'm a realist
<Winter_Shadowhooves> 100% clean version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfNXme3vqs
<pony_4582> omg ponies in almost 2 hours!
<Subscyed> Gah! Everything is so subjective!

<Sugar-Rush> Oh
<spotty_pony> ))
<Colt_Magnum> anypony from the bioware my little pwny thread?
<Fazana> in the knee*
*Molestia is hiding under the bed already
<Phase4> best i can come up with for me is "optimistic pragmatist"

<Molestia> nah, I'm going to get pie
<repony> cant fix roof
<repony> no'
<Rough_Draft> Dash's an easy target. She's the one who falls the most actively when subjugated, so it makes sense. If fans wanna hurt somepony, Dash gives the strongest reaction to weakness.
<Phase4> so where'd I go?
*Molestia leaves for pie
<Subscyed> Sob over his crater?

<gato> >G3
<Flutter_Wonder> awesome
<Ware> From the look of it
<Inquisitor> yea, America is a country founded on good principles, taken the wrong way by people who call themselves patriotic... a true patriot questions their government, not follows obediently
<LupusStriker> does what happen?
<Gameman246> It was fun at first, but the novelty weared off.
<Puck7845> Its all inter-related
<ZokZokMeister> then I got bored
<pony_9049> What is this N7 stuff?
<Subscyed> Thank'ee!
<Likonan> Ahoy there! :D

<Winter_Shadowhooves> IKR
<Milkow> Now it's gonna be stuck in my head all day
<DapperJack> is brining back people from the dead
<Kewpa> Yeah, buy the game and no sub.
<Likonan> So friendship is witchcraft is the Yugioh abridged of MLP?
<Rough_Draft> bit of sarcasm there...
<Fazana> Pinkie invented it
<FlutterKawaii> I saw the reactions to Derpy it was hilarious.
<Flutter_Wonder> <3
<Soren> wait there's going to be a contest
<Thinru> I love the song but can't stand the vocals in this. They're VERY nasal.
<bronyPony> going to my LOL wrecking folder
<Martin> She be messin' up time.
<Rainbow_Dashin> I hope if someone is videoing this chat that I can see myself at one point
<Ware> yep
<DapperJack> and it has 6 out of 9 done?
<Vivix> All my friends know, but theyre not bronies so I dont talk about it to them alot
<Hirro> SQUEEE
<Cabooselololol> awsome
<DatEpicVoice> exept
<Rough_Draft> but yeah, buy the game, no sub.
<Princess_Luna> She was messing with time so yeah.
<Dashie_Dashie> I need to train my voice to do my little pony characters.
<SubLeeLee> better yet mare, what if she TALKS?
<Inquisitor> witchcraft? HERESY!
<DatEpicVoice> it is better
<tangelo84> i've got this and the firday polka on my ipod, have been meaning to get sweetie's race song
<Dashie_Dashie> >.>
<SubLeeLee> :P
<ZombiePony> ...brains...
<badger> love friendship is witchcraft <3
<Plotbuster> almost as good as sweetie bot, but not quite =P
<Perfson> lol it's a Derpy's voice!
<pony_9153> friendship is witchcraft.
<ctharlhie> Pinkie... Pinkie everywhere.
<Shrimp3000> They day I downloaded adblock was only topped by the day I stoped using IE
<SkywardSticks> Darn, that's one thing I don't have.
<HurrHurr> my friend has never seen an episode of the show and he hates it
<Ware> to brink back parents or sometin
<Perfson> not pinkie
<Soren> letm e guess between the cider 900 thing and applejack
<Amras0000> awesome
<Winter_Shadowhooves> pinkie sounds wierd
<DatEpicVoice> since it has an actual plot
<BluePyro> FUCKING COMMERCIALS!
<TheMailMare> o3o
<ZokZokMeister> duh
<Ralathon> Its the extended song from when she and apple bloom use gypsy magic to make a time portal
<Witty_Username> ...What am I watching, and why is it so great?
<Likonan> Ah, i c. Thx :)
<ColorStorm> My video isnt working
<Gameman246> I'm trying to get him to watch 1 episode, but he won't. That and he called me gay D:
<FlutterMagic> you should tell everyone ^^
<Sumica> 00,10I dont like having the video name in the player it messes up the aspect
<Wrhine> i dont like it
<Kewpa> I like her voice, personally...
<BronyDownUnder> i dont have a IRL brony, only a hoeny
<tangelo84> *friday, lol can't type
<GermanBrony> I remember the livestream crash when Find a Pet was sung for the first time.
<Rainbow_Dashin> This sounds like TGAP Trixie
<SubLeeLee> :3
<ZokZokMeister> I hated it too
<Siggy> *sigh* Why oh why must Pony start when I head into work?
<Arcadian> The Derpy reactions slowed everything down. XD
<Martin> ZombiePony: *cocks shotgun*
<pony_9129> i though the abridged version was the mentally advanced series
<Shamus_Aran> I saw what happened in here last week
<Vivix> what a douuche
<DarkDemonWolf76> wana know why i think applejack is one of the coolest ponies? her voice actor loves the flash apple.mov
*Phase4 is back
<Rainbow> what is she making?
<FlutterKawaii> hmm, she not canon in this episode probably, maybe just cameo
<Shamus_Aran> I'm not missing it again
<DarkDemonWolf76> XD
<DarkDemonWolf76> '
<Shrimp3000> O hai
*Headspiner wants to murder ad's
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Derpy sounded odd aswell
<Jean> one of my friends who i got to watch it did not like it at all
<Arcadian> :P
<Ware> time sourve
<ZokZokMeister> It's just how we're brainwashed
<Princess_Luna> A time portal
<I> hey!
<Phase4> 453 users
<P0n-3> I had some hard cider but I drinkded it.
<Soren> this is my favorite song thats playin right now
<DapperJack> mentally advanced is my favorite
<Vivix> hehehe
<rnbw_dsh> Helo everypony!
<bronyPony> it needs some cleaning but i can do that myself
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica: *Points at SB*
<Kirinor> everypony - 1.30 min to go grab some snacks!
<Plotbuster> call in sick, i'm going to
<JowHoof> what ads?
<Sugar-Rush> I agree, it's a nice voice, but it is slightly weird
<Jean> i mean it's not for everyone
<n1ghtmar3_> wb
<Quin2> the anti 4th wall
<repony> where ar u guys on im lost cause of reading an article
<Sumica> 00,10But this video is Pinkies Brew incase you could not tell
<BluePyro> so, what time is it where you are?
<tangelo84> that's why i'm here, shamus
<Dashie_Dashie> *cough*
<BronyDownUnder> (shes my age and tomboyish so it sorta counts)
<DatEpicVoice> yo gi oh abridged goes along the storyline of the original and makes fun of stuff
<P0n-3> That would have been perfect, I should have had some of the other stuff.
<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<rnbw_dsh> (hi Dr. nick)
<threwthedoor> Omg I love this song
<Rainbow_Dashin> lolwut
<_16tons> adds
<CanadianSinna> ADBLOCK
<pony_2718> lol
<Dev_Nights> I hate the ads aswell
<P0n-3> And SAVED the cider.
<Ralathon> That too. But Friendship is Witchcraft is really good as well.
<Subscyed> Tychus_Findlay: Dayum Fame.
<Princess_Luna> She baked the fourth wall
<Cabooselololol> derpy sounded odd cause the VA thought she was a guy
<DapperJack> but i have to admit the witchcraft one does a better storyline
<SubLeeLee> lol yeah, i don't see what buisiness a dj would have at a farm
<FlutterKawaii> wait; when is the episode? Ten?
*String_Shredder moves next to Molestia "wanna go to the moon? ;)"
<DatEpicVoice> while this creates it's own plot
<CanadianSinna> USE ADBLOCK
<ColorStorm> I cant see anything]
<Jean> but to dislike it purely based off what you know of the previous generations without watching g4, is kinda silly
<Winter_Shadowhooves> *facehoof*
<Kewpa> Still adorable
<IrishDrunk> This is where the derpy shitstorm happened?
<Vivix> Yeah this show isnt for everyone but, none of my friends hate it
<ColorStorm> :(*
<TheMailMare> How DO you cook a portal?
<DaniilScit|DWARF> #bronystates
<Fazana> Can't use chrome
<SASFalcon> Gameman246, I know the feel bro. In fact, I'm watching this while that dude is right next to me (unknowing of what I'm watching)
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yes
<Vivix> yeah
<dshannon> apple bloom may have burnt her muffins but her sister got pinkie sick
<ZokZokMeister> I decided to watch it anyway though, after seeing some pony vids and being confronted with bronies on tf2
<repony> play on breaking
<JowHoof> Yeah I just run adblock :D
<Rough_Draft> Yep
<Ryanlauph> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=XMOAHnuTwAc

<dshannon> cupcakes......fml
<SubLeeLee> Watch Friendship is Witchcraft
<Siggy> .... If Pinkie bakes the forth wall, doesn't that mean we're all gonna die?
<DapperJack> they are a bit wild
<Jean> You were my guinea pig :P
<Headspiner> who agrees taht string_shredder has stockholm syndrome
<Gameman246> I only watched an ep because I was curious. After that, I watched all within 3 nights.

<JowHoof> They aren't very good in gneral, this is one of their better songs
<Martin> *soft headbnag*
<FlutterKawaii> Not a portal. I know a portal is just the things to travel through time or somehin?

<tangelo84> pony fan music has taught me that i can like any type of music. never would have thought myself into dubstep, but there you go
<Martin> Who made this song?

<Molestia> Tony: Just disconnect from the server "/disconnect"
<Vivix> I didnt like twilight that much, but now I loove her
