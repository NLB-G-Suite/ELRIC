<Emmi> :O
<Cat> declawing sounds barbaric
<Cat> I'd maybe have a cat I owned neutered, but not declawed
<Emmi> my kitty's previous owner declawed him
<Cat> it'd be like chopping off your finger ends
<Emmi> ikr!!
<Emmi> but now his paws are all squishy and weird and cute
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<HyperMetalLugia> Whoever edited/made that script must be trippin something
<Aristeo> They think of declawing differently in Europe than they do in Amuricah
<Neon> Mikey, Ammeg is making up lies for attention again. Take a look on OFF.
<Mikey> yeah I saw that idk if it's real or fake
<VampirePrincess> if my nails get long enough its like i have claws... very easy to scracth ppl
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Neon> Fake for a number of reasons.
<Emmi> they have barely any structure to them, they're just like fuzzy blobs attached to arms
<Aristeo> :o
<Mikey> I was just looking back into her posts now but she always said she hated her dad blah blah blah
<Aristeo> You wouldn't scratch me though right VampirePrincess? :o
<VampirePrincess> cat can i has another vid?
<Cat> declawing is forbidden in the EU unless it's essential for the health of the animal
<Aristeo> rawr cultures :3
<VampirePrincess> i wouldnt scratch any of my friends Aristeo.
<Aristeo> <3
<Aristeo> And don't scratch Emmi either :O
<Cat> it's completely outlawed in the UK
<Aristeo> Cat: So is capital punishment
<Cat> yes
<Aristeo> You peeps don't like to have any fun over there
<Cat> You enjoy cruelty?
<Cat> srsly
<Aristeo> no
<XD001> if thats an at at walker doing the caramelldansen
<VampirePrincess> cat more music plz?
<Neon> 1. She wouldn't apologize for making a double post if it was to say her dad died. 2. People don't actually pause four times when they write, like when she goes "he's... he's... he's... gone." xD
<Aristeo> :(
<XD001> I am going to commit harry karry
*Aristeo hugs Cat
<drfsupercenter> 03what's that
<Aristeo> I was being kinda sarcastic :3 .... I'm the most liberal person in Alabama
<Mikey> she might to be dramatic sounding like a movie, all kids do that
*Aristeo doesn't like declawing or capital punishment
<XD001> its a cockney slang for hara kiri I think which is suicide in japanese
<XD001> I think
<Aristeo> I just live here Cat :3
<Aristeo> Don't blame me D:
<Mikey> idk I'm not gonna make any accusations quite yet I'll just watch it unfold I guess
<Neon> No one cares about being dramatic if they actually lose someone.
*Aristeo didn't start the fire, it was always burning since the world's been turning
<Mikey> good point...
<Neon> They only do that when they want attention.
*Aristeo pets Cat more
<prince-dari> The first thing you do isn't go an post it on the internet anyway.
<prince-dari> OHSI MY FAMILY JUST DIED!
<Espeon> 06It's a rather special kind of suicide :x
<prince-dari> and*
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Emmi> my other cat had a bad reaction to the declawing surgery, his paws got all puffy and swollen
<lightumbreon> heya AE
<Emmi> but that was not my decision >.>
<Neon> Haha, true, but we don't know how long it's been since she got the news, either.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai LU
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Espeon> 06:3
<VampirePrincess> wow with no music its really quiet in here...
<Aristeo> xD
<VampirePrincess> not irc... irl
*Aristeo hopes Cat isn't mad at him
<Aristeo> D:
<Mikey> mhm
<Mikey> brb
*VampirePrincess pets cat :)
<Aristeo> No one asked for my opinion when they implemented policies... they weren't like "okay, so we have a majority in both the house and the senate... before we have the presidnt sign it, let's make sure Aristeo is okay with it"
<Aristeo> That would be cool if they did that thoguh :O
<Neon> I might give her the benefit of the doubt if she wasn't prone to "creative license" with the truth.
<Cat> http://youtu.be/BbyMjigrxGE
<VampirePrincess> :) ty cat
<Mikey> back
<Neon> Dare me to respond with something like "OH NOEZ"
<Neon> *?
<Mikey> oh no no no no no I wouldn't do that
<Mikey> let's just see what else happens first
<Neon> Alright.
<Mikey> I mean honestly even if she is lying about it we're mods and we should be polite about it until further on if we know for sure if she's lying or not
<prince-dari> No no no no no yes?
<junh1024-XD> :4
<Mikey> I don't want us to get into trouble and if it is true that'd be really rude of us
<prince-dari> Have you guys got an IRC?
<Neon> There's no way to know if it's really true, and she has obviously been lying to use for a long time.
<Neon> I've never needed one, so no.
<prince-dari> Boo. *rotten vegetables*
<Mikey> dari what do you mean like a whole channel??
<Aristeo> :)
<prince-dari> Yeah, a channel.
<prince-dari> Bring traffic to the network.
<Mikey> nope
<Neon> I still had the idea for #jailbait, though.
<prince-dari> LOL
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Neon> Haha, why do you want traffic? I can only imagine.
<Aristeo> \o/
<prince-dari> Because it's so hard to find a bus around here.
<Neon> Quack.
<Mikey> XDDD
<VampirePrincess> ya know what? cat has yet to find something tht he likes but i dont.
<Cat> http://youtu.be/ZGJCnk7fs00
<VampirePrincess> hey neon.
<Neon> Tell me about it. It's highway robbery when do find one, too.
*Cat falls upwards and lands in the attic
<Neon> *when you do
*Aristeo noms Emmi
<prince-dari> Stand and deliver all your change.
<Neon> Why, hello there.
<Cat> what does she taste of?
<Aristeo> hnmmm
*Aristeo noms Emmi more and ponders
<Neon> Even the pennies? Most robbers just find them a nuisance.
<prince-dari> That's a good idea.
<prince-dari> Only carry around pennies, they'll just leave you alone.
<Neon> That's what I do.
<Aristeo> ....... cherries :3
<Neon> When the bullies grabbed me and shook me upside down it'd take like ten minutes for them to empty my pockets and collect them all.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<VampirePrincess`> gr explorer. freaking knocked me off
<VampirePrincess`> :(
<Aristeo> :o
<VampirePrincess`> cat send link again plz?

<Cat|wantsVimto> vimto is some kind of tasty cordial drink
<Cat|wantsVimto> I don't know what flavour it's supposed to be
<Cat|wantsVimto> fruity

<Cat|wantsVimto> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JphZtpafdKY
<prince-dari> ...Glee...Eugh...
<Neon> Don't even get me started on Glee.
<Neon> That show is a meat grinder for songs.
<Mikey> indeed
<Mikey> I love how their director or whatever got all mad and threw a hissy fit when the foo fighters declined
<Neon> I'd be embarassed on their behalf if I was involved in any of the dramatic arts.
<Neon> Right? That was so funny.
<Cat|wantsVimto> I think I know what band I want to put on next
<VampirePrincess> :D
<VampirePrincess> this one is taking a while to load...
<Neon> Hey, want to cause some disruptions on epic-chat?
<Neon> That's what she said.
<VampirePrincess> ...
<prince-dari> /notice Neon Sure, what do you have in mind?
<Neon> Look what I started with and you'll know.
<prince-dari> /notice Neon Lol, ok.
<Cat|wantsVimto> gah, I had to link the shortened radio version of the song :/
<Cat|wantsVimto> typical
<VampirePrincess> ?
<prince-dari> Shortened version, very typical.
<VampirePrincess> its still loading.
<Neon> That's all we ever get is the shortened version.
<Neon> Can't we ever get something with LENGTH?
<Neon> Good save.
<VampirePrincess> LOL
<Cat|wantsVimto> I linked a thirteen-minute long song earlier D:
<prince-dari> Damn, that's a long one.
<VampirePrincess> it was awesome too
<Cat|wantsVimto> longest song I have is 39 minutes I think
<Neon> Yeah, but I've had better.
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Neon> He was okay.
<Cat> if it doesn't load, have this song instead http://youtu.be/F4lViga2wgs
<prince-dari> Neon: Oh really, how long?
<Neon> I wouldn't want to make anyone self-conscious...
*Cat throws a yardstick at Neon
<VampirePrincess> yay that one worked.
<Neon> But at least comparable to the average dagger.

<Cat> it's not all about length
<Cat> you need some girth, too
<Cat> D:
<Neon> Now we're talking.
<Skylands> 10Hey SS
<prince-dari> You make a fair point.
<Neon> Who wants a pencil when they can have a magic marker?
<SilverSonic> Hai~

<prince-dari> Well I don't know about you, but I don't think it's as good if it's too hard.

<Ray> 02Hiya Silver~ :3
<Neon> Are you saying you don't like the pain?
<Neon> I think that's vital.
<prince-dari> Well it's all about how much pain it is. You want a balance.
<SilverSonic> Hai Ray~ :3
<VampirePrincess> cat i love coheed and cambria. hehehe
<Neon> How can there be balance when it's so heavy?
<VampirePrincess> and the song is over

<Umbreon> 12not going to happen
<SilverSonic> oh ok
<Mikey> srsly her father isn't that bad it's not like he raped her or something
<Neon> Oh, I have to see this.
<Damos> hey I found Umby
<Damos> jk
<Neon> She actually alluded to that.
<Neon> But it's just another exciting piece of the drama plot she's making.
<Mikey> IM AMMEG MY DAD CALLS ME PRETTY IT'S REALLY CREEPY
<Mikey> NO FATHER EVER CALLS THEIR DAUGHTER PRETTY UNLESS THEY WANT TO GET UNDER THE DRESS
<prince-dari> Lol, I hope the inspiration for her username wasn't just her name. "ME? AM MEG! AMMEG".
<Mikey> nah it
<Mikey> it's backwards of Gemma which is a character in the books
<Spyrorocks`> http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6492741/crazy-chinese-kid-street-performers
<Spyrorocks`> that is crazy
<prince-dari> Oh.

<prince-dari> [22:35] <Spyrorocks`> that is crazy

<Aristeo> haha
<Aristeo> deja vu
<Aristeo> I've been there before! :O
<Neon> I was about to say "You know what's really crazy? I could've SWORN you were from my forum."
<prince-dari> LOL!
<prince-dari> I bet he would have banned you. XD
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks`: That's in Bejing China
<Neon> You know what's really crazy? I could've SWORN you were from my forum.
<SilverSonic> oh
<Aristeo> I was in that exact spot
<Neon> He won't ban me. :P

<Aristeo> I remember that street pattern :O
<Ray> 02hmm...
<Aristeo> That's AWESOME :O
<Spyrorocks`> Neon, whats your forum?
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, I have never been to china
<prince-dari> Why not?
<Spyrorocks`> but i want to go to their big electronics market
<Stormy`> [16:39:36] <+Spyrorocks`> Neon, whats your forum?
<Stormy`> XDDDD
<Spyrorocks`> I hear they have sweet stuff, including pre-release stuff
<prince-dari> Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
<Mikey> LMAO
<Spyrorocks`> my dad and i might go.
<Neon> It's a quaint little place called Spyro Forum.
<Neon> Mikey, you aren't involved so you don't have to be worried, but look what I wrote on OFF.
<Mikey> omg neon
<Mikey> hahaha
<Mikey> that's so mean/funny at the same time
<unknown> Leafeon: your nick is familiar..
<Neon> The Internet is not a place to look for sympathy. You wouldn't go into a city you've never been to and just tell strangers that you lost your father.
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, I was more impressed with the kid who was balancing that bottle
<Aristeo> Neon: Never heard of it
*Aristeo nods
<Neon> Me either.
<Aristeo> You see a lot of that kind of stuff on street corners
<Neon> That's what he said.
<Mikey> http://ammegofkiel.deviantart.com/journal/40367126/
<Mikey> "Mpre money for me"
<Mikey> that's terrible
<Mikey> the typo and what she's saying
<Neon> "IM SO SORRY hes in a good place now oh well then thats good maybe ur free from him but hes gone awww that sucks but it does not"
<Neon> If he's as bad as she claims, you'd think they'd say he's probably not in a good place.
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks`: Did you notice how agressive they were about getting donations?
<prince-dari> What, "I'm so happy for you, well at least now he will have to endure horrible torture in the fiery pits of hell for eternity"? :P
<Spyrorocks`> you need to be aggressive if you are a street preformer.
<Neon> That's pretty much the answer she was asking for, if you read the post.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Mikey> HE CHEATED ON MY MOM HE'S THE EQUIVALENT TO HITLER AND DESERVED TO DIE
<Neon> Besides, I don't believe in lying to people just to make them feel better.
<Mikey> BECAUSE PEOPLE HARDLY EVER CHEAT ON EACHOTHER
<Aristeo> Yeah, but they're really agressive about it ... it's a cultural thing
<prince-dari> Why not just cremate him and eat him with milk? :)
<Aristeo> They're very blunt about things in their culture
<prince-dari> Mmm, tasty.
<Spyrorocks`> yeah I noticed that
<Spyrorocks`> they are actually the same way even when they come live in another country
<Ray> 02Craiglol!

<HyperMetalLugia> .o.
<Ascendant> what the f
<Ascendant> god damn retard fcking stalked me
<HyperMetalLugia> How?
<Quanyails> 7Language, NS.
<Light_Latias> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Question: What nuts does DRF love?
<HyperMetalLugia> answer: CashEWs
*HyperMetalLugia shot
*Quanyails 7(not really) lol'd.
<Quanyails> 7But really, that was funny. :P
<Ascendant> Quanyails, I don't really care about language.
<Ascendant> HML I have no idea
<Ascendant> http://pastebin.com/VgXczydu
<Ascendant> that's the email he sent me
<Ascendant> after I banned him
<Quanyails> 7IRC rules, mmm'kay? o3o
<HyperMetalLugia> Do you have stalkblock ;o
<Ascendant> /care
<Ascendant> lmao HML
<Ascendant> I wish
<Light_Latias> o...k
<Ascendant> he's bloody worse than Skylands' stalker
<Ascendant> and has terrible english
<ChaoMagma> 4I'M FREAKIN BORED!!!!!!11111ONEONEONE
<Quanyails> 7Really, Chao?
<HyperMetalLugia> At least he isn't afraid of anything and is cool
<Ascendant> I care?
<ChaoMagma> 4yesh :<
<Ascendant> lol HML
<Ascendant> this guy can go die in a fire for all I care
<Ascendant> yet another retard from PS
<Quanyails> 7Hack me a male Macargo with Heat Wave. :P
<Quanyails> 7('cause that would actually allow me some use)
<HyperMetalLugia> Male + Heat = wow
<ChaoMagma> 4i can only hack shinyness and pokemonness
<Quanyails> 7Darn.
<ChaoMagma> 4not moves
<ChaoMagma> 4sowwy
<Ascendant> lol
<Quanyails> 7Eh, then give me a normal Seedot.
<ChaoMagma> 4oh, and levelness
<ChaoMagma> 4i had a battle vs a stranger
<ChaoMagma> 4i won!!!
<Quanyails> 7If you have a D/P/HG/SS, then get a Shiftry, teach it Defog, then transfer it.
<Quanyails> 7Make sure it's male. o3o
<ChaoMagma> 4i don't have 4th gen
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<ChaoMagma> 4besides
<Quanyails> 7Because I'd like Defog for competitive play. :P
<ChaoMagma> 4defog is a hm, can't be transfered
<Quanyails> 7It can.
<Quanyails> 7If you send a pokemon from D/P to HG/SS then to B/W.
<Quanyails> 7Complicated, but works.
<ChaoMagma> 4???
<ChaoMagma> 4i dun get it
<ChaoMagma> 4explain please
<Quanyails> 7Defog is only a HM in D/P.
<Quanyails> 7It's replaced by Whirlpool in HG/SS.
<Quanyails> 7Thus, you can transfer pokemon with Defog from HG/SS to B/W.
<ChaoMagma> 4so, googolated
<Quanyails> 7Y'can't get me a Defog Shiftry, I'll guess. :P
<Chimera> 04I just saw Toy Story 3...
<Chimera> 04Dang....
<Light_Latias> yay or nay?
<Chimera> 04also wait
<Chimera> 04(yay, VERY yay)
<Light_Latias> XD
<Chimera> 04(but :c @ the sad parts)
<Sneas> ??????????????????????/
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm sowwy, i'm a BAD PERSON!!! D'X
<Light_Latias> same
<Chimera> 04Quan really?
<Quanyails> 7Nyeh?
<Chimera> 04So no whirlpool in HGSS or Defog in DPPt, but vice-versa is okay?
<Chimera> 04Cool I guess o.o
<Chimera> 04Even though Defog is useless xD
<Quanyails> 7Pah, it clears away Stealth Rock. :P
<Quanyails> 7(And Shiftry on a Sun team, which I'm hoping to build. >>)
<Quanyails> 7But yeah, actually getting a Shiftry with Defog is going to be D:
<Chimera> 04Why?
<Quanyails> 7 1: get a Seedot on D/P. 2, evolve it and teach it Defog. 3. Send it to HG/SS. 4. Transfer it to B/W. 5. Breed for optimal stats.
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<ChaoMagma> 2seeya

<Ascendant> Do you happen to know any statistics?
<Ascendant> For pokemon attacks
<Ascendant> As in
<Kyu> 07uh
<Ascendant> How do they calculate how much damage something does?
<Kyu> 07somewhat
<Ascendant> Based on attack/defense/move power/crits, etc.
<Ascendant> I'm going to code it into the !fight script or make a new one :x
<Kyu> 07there's a calculator for that, but I don't know the actual values off the top of my head
<Ascendant> Ah
<SilverSonic> :P
<SilverSonic> !fight Scriptbot
*ScriptBot uses Aeroblast on Scriptbot! It's a critical hit! Scriptbot loses 214 HP! Scriptbot has 892266 HP left!

<Shy> Hello!
<Ascendant> I need to update ScriptBot's scripts
<SilverSonic> :P
<SilverSonic> they're fine for me :P
<Ascendant> they're not for me
<Ascendant> >bugs
<SilverSonic> Nothing's ever perfect
<Ascendant> a couple of scripts have security issues
<Ascendant> need to fix them before someone figures out how to exploit it
<Kyu> 07ah
<Kyu> 07found the formula
<Kyu> 07Damage = ((((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * AttackStat * AttackPower / DefenseStat) / 50) + 2) * STAB * Weakness/Resistance * RandomNumber / 100
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Sneas> loladventuretime
<Kyu> 07and the random number is between 85-100
<Creideiki> Kyu: Define ranges, otherwise the variable means nothing. :P
<Kyu> 07well
<Kyu> 07that all depends on the pokemon o.o
<SilverSonic> Oh god not that show
<SilverSonic> that show is rubbish
*SilverSonic used to watch 1000 Ways to Die
<SilverSonic> x.x
<SilverSonic> I still do watch it
<Creideiki> Also, is the division always integer division? :P
<SilverSonic> or just Wikipedia what deaths ive missed
<Kyu> 07yup
<Kyu> 07they're all pokemon stats, so it's just all rounded at the end lol

<SilverSonic> Sleep well :3
*Ray hugs back
<SilverSonic> X3
<Ray> 02Thanks :3
<SilverSonic> :3
<Ray> 02Same for you~
<SilverSonic> ^_^
<Ray> 02now poof
<Ray> 02Kthxbai~
<Aristeo> :o
<Chimera> 04mew...
<Ascendant> thanks Kyu
<Chimera> 04my wrist still hurts ;-;
<Ascendant> RandomNumber is what?
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> okay
<Ascendant> That's reasonably easy to code
<Chimera> 04Also fun fact: computers aren't really suppose to be random
<Kyu> 07also there's stat changes too, but that's easy
<Chimera> 04Am I correct?
<Ascendant> yeah stat changes are easy
<Ascendant> STAB is how much again?
<Ascendant> and weakness/resistance?
<Kyu> 071.5
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 072
<Kyu> 072, 4, 1/2, and 1/4
<Ascendant> Oh right
<Ascendant> yeah that's easy
<Kyu> 07if you're gonna stick in all the typings
<Ascendant> yeah I will
<Chimera> 04wait
<Ascendant> it's not too hard
<Kyu> 07how about swords dance/growl/etc?
<Ascendant> yeah will be doing those as well
<Ascendant> How much do each of them increase the attack stats again?
<Ascendant> or lower
<Kyu> 07k
<Chimera> 042 is super, 4 is double super, 1/2 is not very effective, and 1/4 is really not effective, right?
<Kyu> 07so in order
<Ascendant> yeah @ Chimera
<Chimera> 04k
<Kyu> 07starting from -6 levels to +6
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Kyu> 0725%, 29, 33, 40, 50, 66, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400
<Ascendant> Ah
<Chimera> 04ASCENDANT used ATTRACT
*Chimera RUNS
<Ascendant> oh god
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> Thanks Kyu
<Ascendant> I don't think there's anything else I need to do
<Ascendant> besides abilities...oh crap, abilities
<Chimera> 04if there is
<Chimera> 04bulba
<Chimera> 04and lol
<Ascendant> am I even bothered enough to do those?
<Ascendant> I need to get a list of 5th gen moves
<Ascendant> I have all the ones from 1-4
<Kyu> 07the stat changes happen after the main calculation
<Chimera> 04How will you assign everyone an ability?
<Ascendant> Ah
<Creideiki> Sp, for the fun... here's that formula in APL:
<Creideiki> DAM ‚Üê ‚åä((16? + 84) √ó WEAKRES √ó STAB √ó 2 + ((‚åä(POW √∑ DEF)) √ó ATK √ó 2 + 2 √ó ‚åä(LVL √∑ 5)) √∑ 50) √∑ 100
<Chimera> 04Let alone nature?
<Ascendant> lmao Creideiki
<Creideiki> (APL: Operator precedence is right-to-left evaluation, no precedence.)
<Ascendant> nature
<Ascendant> screw nature
<Chimera> 04:c
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> if you REALLY want nature
<Ascendant> I can do it
<Chimera> 04well for coding sake
<Chimera> 04I guess it's negligable
<Kyu> 07nature and statuses are harder lol
<Chimera> 04Are you going to be doing leveling up?
<Chimera> 04OH LOL
<Chimera> 04This would be epic
<Ascendant> statuses would be a bit hard
<Ascendant> I will be doing levelling
<Chimera> 04Everyone's level is their idlerpg level
<Chimera> 04XD
<Ascendant> ...lmao
<Chimera> 04You and Kyu dominate
<Ascendant> oh crap
<Chimera> 04Everyone else gets OHKO'd
<Ascendant> idlerpg died again
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> the computer go killed
<Chimera> 04:<
<Ascendant> will be up tomorrow
<Chimera> 04k
<Ascendant> I'll move it to somewhere more stable
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04btw ascendant
<Chimera> 04I got hit by a car and lived :D
<Ascendant> anyway what do you mean by after the main calculation, Kyu?
<Chimera> 04D:
<Ascendant> nice Chimera
<Chimera> 04yep
<Chimera> 04now my wrist is strained
<Chimera> 04ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
<Ascendant> do you just multiply the final calculation by the percentage or something? @ Kyu
<Ascendant> >:

<Kyu> 07lol why'd you underline normal
<Ascendant> derp
<Chimera> 04Type changing? XD
<Ascendant> yeah
<Chimera> 04because it SUCKS
<Ascendant> you can do !settype

<Chimera> 04Dual types? :3333333
<Ascendant> yeah
<Chimera> 04<3

<Chimera> 04Hydreigon
*Chimera shot
<Ascendant> no u
<Chimera> 04yes
<Kyu> 07you should set type and set moves o3o
<Chimera> 04because
<Chimera> 04i love it
<Chimera> 04|D
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> I'm setting moves
<Kyu> 07:D
<Chimera> 044 moves each?
<Ascendant> I guess
<Chimera> 04or less gay?
<Ascendant> unless you want to change that?
<Chimera> 04yeah
<Ascendant> know every move you've learnt
<HyperMetalLugia> lolwhat
<Kyu> 07that sounds so insanely complicated |D
<Chimera> 04well hm
<Ascendant> I can do it XD
<Chimera> 04that could get you overpowered
<Ascendant> I have the base code for it from my !fight script
<HyperMetalLugia> Just needs to be copied and pasted
<`> Night Everybody :D
<Ascendant> and edited like crap
<Kyu> 07I wanted to do something similar with my battle script but I got bored :3C
<Ascendant> I get easily bored
<Chimera> 04How about you do a calculator for who can know what?
<Ascendant> I'm not sure really
<Chimera> 04Based on type and set characteristics in a list
<Ascendant> dunno what exactly to do with moves
<Chimera> 04like claws/rakes, leafs, roots, stuff like that
<Ascendant> well
<Chimera> 04That way if we "find TMS" (I feel like we're making an IRC RPG)
<Ascendant> LOL
<Chimera> 04We can only learn what works for us
<Ascendant> IRC RPG
<Ascendant> oh dear
<Ascendant> I could probably make this work like IdleRPG

<Chimera> 04lo siento
<Ascendant> let's start coding this
<Chimera> 04est√° mi problema
<Chimera> 04k
<SilverSonic> I would love to have an iPotty so i can get my sister a gift for her birthday
<HSX> Lul
<HSX> Waiting for computer to sleep
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Slow
<HSX> Oh btw

<Ascendant> yo
<HSX> My right hand was strained
<HSX> A
<Armageddon> ;o
<HSX> And I'm RIGHT HANDED
<HyperMetalLugia> My left hand is strained
<Ascendant> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> And I'm semi-right handed
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HSX> >_<
<HyperMetalLugia> >.>
*Ascendant compiles a plaintext list of 5th gen moves
<SilverSonic> EWWW 5th Gen
<HyperMetalLugia> SS, better than 6th gen
<HSX> -w-
<Ascendant> I still haven't figured out what to do about moves
<HSX> It's GSC
<SilverSonic> o_o theres a 6th gen
<HSX> duh?
<HSX> No
<SilverSonic> LOL
<HSX> When it comes out
<Ascendant> I need to make a move system
<Ascendant> when 6th gen comes out
<HSX> HGSS will be better than it
<HSX> Lol
<Ascendant> the world will bow to its fail
<Ascendant> or the other way round
<Quilava> who's RJ
<HSX> K?
<SilverSonic> well, 6th Gen is gonna be rubbish
<Ascendant> 5th gen is bad enough lol
<HSX> GameFreak should just go independanr
<HSX> :|
<Quilava> ...all that makes me think of is rocket jumping
<HSX> Independant
<Ascendant> pokemon should make a pokemon RPG
<SilverSonic> RedJolteon
<HSX> Owait
<HSX> :P
<Ascendant> where you actually play as a pokemon and such
<HyperMetalLugia> Waait
<Ascendant> not like PMD
<HSX> Oh
<HSX> Yeah
<Quilava> ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<Ascendant> but an action RPG
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay
<Quilava> I don't think I know them
<Ascendant> like Oblivion
<HSX> That would be cool
<Ascendant> now that'd be awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew
<HyperMetalLugia> Tha'd be stupid
<SilverSonic> pokemon RPG <- I can imagine SEGA making this
<HSX> And boss fights
<HyperMetalLugia> PMD or nothing
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Ascendant> yeah it'd be freaking awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Hopefully like Sonic Chronicles
<HSX> Remixes of the legendary pokemon music
<HyperMetalLugia> :{
<Ascendant> I wanted to make one
<HSX> Vs Ho-Oh in high quality
<Ascendant> but I'm not that good
<HSX> Ascendant
<Ascendant> and I don't know how to make games lol
<SilverSonic> Oh god Sonic Chronicles had some of the most rubbish music ever
<HSX> Let's make it ourselves
<SilverSonic> except battle 4 that was amazing
<Ascendant> if I could steal WoW's engine then maybe
<HSX> OH GOD
<HSX> CHRONICLES
<HyperMetalLugia> NO
<HyperMetalLugia> ;.;
<HyperMetalLugia> Kill it
<HSX> GAMEBOY QUALITY MUSIC GTFO
<HyperMetalLugia> YES
<HyperMetalLugia> My ears
<Ascendant> gameboy music was good
<Ascendant> RSE's music was nice
<HSX> game good
<HyperMetalLugia> But on a DS music
<HSX> Songs except intro bad
<HSX> Um
<HSX> No I mean
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HSX> GBA quality on a DS
<HSX> no
<HSX> GB quality -.-
<HSX> It sounded crappy
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> anyway
<HSX> Sonic 3 remix was EWW
<Ascendant> LET'S GET TO SCRIPTING
<Ascendant> actually
<Ascendant> finding 5th gen moves first
<Chimera> They shoulda hired Snappleman
*Chimera runs
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> I'm not doing abilities
<Ascendant> no natures either
<Ascendant> unless you still want them
<Ascendant> but they'll have no effect on stats
<eXAKR> http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/cit_internet_on_a_disk.jpg
<SilverSonic> <Chimera> They shoulda hired Snappleman < You seriously havent heard his doomsday remix?
<Soyuz> SilverSonic; this one? o3o
<SilverSonic> o3o huh?
<HSX> What the F***?!
<eXAKR> !chimera
*eXAKR forcibly owns chimera forever
<chimera> And yes I did
<chimera> It's awesome
<SilverSonic> Shes on :3
<eXAKR> !chimera
<chimera> Ugh my wrist hurts waaay too much ;-;
<Ascendant> awesome
<Ascendant> found a list
<Ascendant> I love you gedit <3
<Ascendant> so useful for getting rid of crap
<Ascendant> and then if gedit's find/replace doesn't work I can use nightshadow|VNC's regex script

<chimera> Hi drf :3
<Ascendant> for anyone who wants it
<Ascendant> http://pastebin.com/jeNDA300
<Ascendant> there's a list of 5th gen only moves
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> ED
<Ascendant> now
<Ascendant> I need to figure out what each move does lol
<Ascendant> actually
<Ascendant> why don't I just leave out 5th gen moves
<Ascendant> I'm lazy
<chimera> Lol
<Ascendant> effort >:
<chimera> Most of them are evil anyway
<chimera> Incinerate and acrobatics
<chimera> Can screw you over
<Ascendant> o-o?
<chimera> Incinerate burns your held berry
<Ascendant> ouch
<chimera> Acrobatics has double damadge with no held item
<Ascendant> .________________.
<chimera> Wait not double
<chimera> Probably 4x
<Ascendant> ouch
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<eXAKR> o
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Ascendant> now that'd hurt
<chimera> Seeing how drf got pwned all the time xD
<chimera> By dinochicken
<Ascendant> Weavile. That thief ability thing. Acrobatics.
<Ascendant> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<HyperMetalLugia> Fuuuuuuuuu ;<
<chimera> Yep :V
<Ascendant> anyway
<Ascendant> anyone
<Ascendant> want to help me with this script?
<HyperMetalLugia> no
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Ascendant> damnit VNC
<Ascendant> stop screwing up
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> why is it that in every single script I have
<Ascendant> I have about 50+ brackets?
<HyperMetalLugia> I dunno?
<Ascendant> serious
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Ascendant> in the swearkick script
<Ascendant> I have like
<Ascendant> 30
<Ascendant> the fight script has over 100
<Ascendant> about 150
<Ascendant> wtf
<chimera> Ascendant
<chimera> I'd help
<chimera> But I can't
<chimera> ;-;
<Ascendant> I think I mostly need data
<Ascendant> because the scripting shouldn't be that hard
<Ascendant> considering I have the base code
<SilverSonic> lolcowtipping
<SilverSonic> Cow tipping is fun XD
<chimera> K
<Ascendant> !fight [TST]Bot

<eXAKR> I remember liking Halsemon and Renamon
<eXAKR> RENAMON.
<Ascendant> lol halsemon

<eXAKR> Darwin Award Nominee.
<nickstr> ouch
<eXAKR> http://failblog.org/2011/05/05/epic-fail-photos-environmental-fail-2/ <- No wonder it's so hard to pass green legislation in America
<nickstr> the section about a transmitter acting like a microwave oven is PARTIALLY true
<nickstr> RF has been documented to cause heating in living tissues but microwave ovens concentrate the radiation into a tighter space for a greater heating effect
<eXAKR> http://failblog.org/2011/05/05/epic-fail-photos-engrish-funny-honest-and-cheap/
<nickstr> radio and TV transmission antennas only concentrate energy into the horizontal plane resulting in a radiation pattern much like a doughnut
<nickstr> wider coverage but more difficult reception very close to the tower in many cases
<Typhlosion> Does anyone recall me mentioning a Monkey girl?
<nickstr> just my two cents about the RF issue
<Creideiki> nickstr: Proper word is a torus. And the pattern is torodial.
<Armageddon> o_o
<Armageddon> no...?
<nickstr> I know that
<nickstr> just explaining it in a simpler way using something that people are familiar with
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03Cherry Dr. Pepper doesn't taste much different than the normal kind
<Quilava> why do you have to amsg everything :|
<Armageddon> X-chat does /amsg on every single window
<Armageddon> not just the network
<Armageddon> it's annoying
<Quilava> ...amsg is always annoying
<SilverSonic> amsg?
<Armageddon> yeah amsg is annoying
<Armageddon> SilverSonic, /amsg shit here
<Armageddon> prints that crap on every channel on the network (on mIRC)
<Sneas> :3
<Armageddon> lmao Sneas
<SilverSonic> ooh
<Ascendant> Oh
<Ascendant> Kyu, do you know the chances of a move missing?
<Ascendant> or well the formula
<Quilava> holy crap I need to learn to chew
<Kyu> 07uh
<Armageddon> o.o
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Sneas> o.o
<Quilava> someday I'm gonna choke.... more than usual

*Armageddon hugs
<SilverSonic> :C
<Sneas> TIBERIUM
<Quilava> IRIDIUM
<Armageddon> ;o
<Ascendant> and how long sleep lasts...
<Ascendant> the sleep thing I could probably get away with setting the number of !fights as $rand(1,5) or something
<Kyu> 07sleep is random between 0 and 6, but weighted towards 2-4, I think
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> and $rand does not like being weighted lol
<Kyu> 07and hitting is just move accuracy x evasion
<Kyu> 07er
<Kyu> 07well
<drf|laptop> 03yay
<drf|laptop> 03LL and I earned the Love Shirt avatar item for getting an achievement
<Ascendant> evasion :x
<Kyu> 07(accuracy x accuracy level) x (evasion)
<drf|laptop> 03we totally need to wear the..nvm
<Ascendant> lmao
<drf|laptop> 03it's for Portal 2
<drf|laptop> 03hug 3 people and youg et an achievement called Friends List With Benefits (I'm dead serious)
<Kyu> 07er
<Kyu> 07ffs
<Ascendant> lolwut?
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Kyu> 07no wonder moves can miss with 100% accuracy o3o
<Ascendant> o_O
<drf|laptop> 03EW THAT FACE
<Ascendant> lmao
<SilverSonic> o_O
<SilverSonic> o3o
<Kyu> 07apparently a 100% accurate move is actually 99.6% accurate lol
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> really?
<drf|laptop> 03god dang it you guys
<drf|laptop> 03I went to type "ew that face" in Xbox live when it asked me to type in my email
<drf|laptop> 03>_<
<Ascendant> lmaaaaaaaaaaao
<junh1024-XD> ahahahaha
<SilverSonic> why say ew that face in teh first place anyways drf
<drf|laptop> 03because it's incredibly annoying
<drf|laptop> 03that's all
<Kyu> 07well then stop being a dork

<drf|laptop> 03also :O one more view
<Ascendant> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03also it's 12:34 right now
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> but yeah, Kyu, what's the evasion of a pokemon or whatnot?
<Kyu> 07evasion is nothing unless raised
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> but wait
<Ascendant> wouldn't (accuracy x accuracy level) x (evasion) = 0 then?
<Kyu> 07well
<Kyu> 07100%
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 07so (accuracy x accuracy level) x (1 - evasion%)
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> you mean 1 x evasion%?
<Kyu> 07no
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> the evasion% is the same as any other stat changes amirite?
<Kyu> 07nope lol
<Ascendant> ._.
<Kyu> 071 evasion level gives 25% chance to evade
<Kyu> 07so 1 - .25 - 75% chance of a 100% accurate move to hit
<Armageddon> be back in ~30 minutes
<Armageddon> picking up my bro
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> OH
<Ascendant> I get it
<Ascendant> thanks
<Kyu> 07in any case, here
<Kyu> 07http://www.legendarypokemon.net/battlemech
<Ascendant> ah
<Kyu> 07there's the ratios for evasion and accuracy
<Ascendant> well, thanks for your help
<Kyu> 07I'd explain things better, but I cbb cuz I just got on summer break =P
<Ascendant> lmao nice
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> do you have any suggestions for what base stats to start out with?
<Ascendant> everyone starts on level 1
<Kyu> 07level 5
<Ascendant> start on level 5?
<Kyu> 07yeah
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> base stats 8 or something?
<holmes> Allo!
<Ascendant> damnit
<Ascendant> I'll be back in 30 minutes

<Ascendant> so then Kyu, why start on level 5? o.o
<Ascendant> ohai
<Ascendant> derp
<Armageddon> back
<Kyu> 07because that's where starters start :D
<Ascendant> lmao
<Kyu> 07also what eggs used to
<Umbreon> 12kyu DX
*Umbreon puts you on his head
<Kyu> 07eep
<Umbreon> 12i miss the old days
<Kyu> 07?
<Umbreon> 12when you were more active
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I guess
<Ascendant> What base stats then?
<Kyu> 07bases should be a random number between 15-25
<Kyu> 07stat increases per level from 1-4
<Kyu> 07just because there's no way to do EVs and IVs lol
<Ascendant> well EVs and IVs would be retarded lol because there'd be no point
<Ascendant> Probably could do it but it'd be extremely difficult
<Ascendant> and the calculations would end up like my flying banana equations
<Ascendant> equations with massive amounts of brackets*
<Ascendant> and hm, that sounds reasonable
<Umbreon> 12Ascendant
<Umbreon> 12start what at level 5?
<Kyu> 07well you can't have EVs without every battler having real base stats
<Ascendant> True
<Ascendant> And Umbreon, coding a sort of "battle simulator" script thing
<Kyu> 07same with IVs lol
<Umbreon> 12oh
<Ascendant> well EVs I definitely can't do
<Ascendant> IVs possibly
<Ascendant> as they're kinda set/random
<Kyu> 07and I don't think there is a IV/base stat/nature calculation that I can find
<Ascendant> Is there even one? Or is it just random?
<Ascendant> I'm not doing natures for now
<Ascendant> Too difficult to calculate
<Ascendant> IVs probably not either, although that makes hidden power retardedly useless
<Kyu> 07there's some calculation between IVs, natures, base stats, and a random number that makes a pokemon have what stats it has
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> well if I (or you) can find that calculation I'll add it
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> (2*BST+5+IV+(EV/4))*nature effect
<Ascendant> And HP:
<Ascendant> (2*BST+10+100+IV+(EV/4)
<Ascendant> but that's level 100
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> ((2*BST + IV + EV/4) * L/100 + 5) * N
<Kyu> 07so you'd give everyone a random IV for each stat at level 5
<Kyu> 07and have that calculate their starting stats
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Kyu> 07although I'd make base stat totals all be 100 so everyone's even aside from IVs
<Kyu> 07and that would mean you don't have to deal with EVs
<Ascendant> Hm
<Ascendant> EVs I doubt I can do
<Ascendant> ...and then I need to figure out HP stuff lol
<Ascendant> I mean
<Ascendant> hidden power
<Ascendant> I have the calculation for hit points
<Ascendant> (2*BST + IV + EV/4) * L/100 + L + 10
<Ascendant> ah maths, wonderful
<Armageddon> ;o
<Armageddon> ohai Aizen
<Kyu> 07I'd just say screw Hidden Power and Secret Power
<Kyu> 07since people are picking their moves anyways o3o
<Kyu> 07Hidden Power is weak anyways, and Secret Power needs field changes o3o;
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> field changes oh god
<Ascendant> but well
<Kyu> 07and then there's weather o3o
<Ascendant> I dunno how to make the base stats total to 100 :x
<Kyu> 07I'd skip that too lol
<Ascendant> ...weather.
<Kyu> 07uh
*Ascendant dies
<Kyu> 07base stats don't total 100
<Ascendant> IVs?
<Kyu> 07I meant 100 per base stat
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 07so it would total 600, like Mew/etc
<Ascendant> oh right
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> that'd be fairer
<Kyu> 07weather is a simple multiplier for rain and sun
<Kyu> 07but sandstorm and hail are odd
<Ascendant> well, I could do weather, but yeah, those 2 would be dodgy
<Kyu> 07not to mention Poison
<Ascendant> as readini bawwwws at searches
<Kyu> 07Toxic
<Kyu> 07Spikes
<Kyu> 07TOXIC SPIKES
<Ascendant> toxic spikes, spikes etc. I'm removing
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> lmao
<Kyu> 07XD
<Ascendant> stealth rock too
<Ascendant> those sort of moves can go die in a fire
<nickstr> I was trying to recall what Australia's national anthem is and the nation's external shortwave service threw me for a curve
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Ascendant> lolwut?
<nickstr> I kept thinking it was Waltzing Matilda but no, not quite
<Ascendant> heya Drake
<Kyu> 07so Ascendant
<Umbreon> 12o-O
<Ascendant> It's Australia Advance Fair @ nickstr
<Drake> 04ohai
<Ascendant> derp
<nickstr> I know that now
<nickstr> well I am an American
<Ascendant> yeah derp
<nickstr> not ignorant though
<Ascendant> and yeah, Kyu?
<Kyu> 07the battle would just be !fight (whoever) and it outputs one line just like it is now right
<Ascendant> Probably
<Ascendant> I could give you the databases and stuff for your !battle script
<Kyu> 07so anyone could battle anyone at any time
<nickstr> interesting thing is it did not become official until 1984
<Kyu> 07I dun need it =P
<Ascendant> And yeah, they could
<Ascendant> spam could be a problem though :x
<Kyu> 07so if there's nothing that keeps it one-on-one
<Ascendant> I might make a script like !startbattle nick etc. so it's one-on-one
<Kyu> 07pretty much everything turn based can be take nout
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Ascendant> and they can't spam crap
<Ascendant> well true
<nickstr> the Star Spangled Banner became the US national anthem by an act of president Franklin D Roosevelt in 1931
<Ascendant> might make a few versions of the script
<nickstr> however it was written in 1812
<Ascendant> to overcome crappy problems
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I'll probably remove status stuff like poison, burn, etc.
<Ascendant> because the system would be weird
<Ascendant> Sleep I might put in because it'd be funny
<Ascendant> for people to activate the script then go "DAMN" when they figure out they're asleep
<Ascendant> Hm
<Ascendant> do you have a calculation for EXP, Kyu?
<Umbreon> 12!imdb Ascendant
<[TST]Bot> Ascendant Pictures [us] :: http://www.imdb.com/company/co0094902
<Ascendant> ._.
<Kyu> 07well
<Kyu> 07a normal pokemon needs around a million exp to get to 100
<Kyu> 07so I'd toss that out the window and make your own =P
<Ascendant> ...oh dear
<Ascendant> wow
<Ascendant> a fast levelling pokemon still requires 800,000 EXP for level 100
<Ascendant> :x
<Kyu> 07I say start with 2 wins gives 1 level at the start, and add 1 more win needed every 2 levels
<Kyu> 07so lv5 needs 2 wins, lv7 needs 3, 9 needs 4, etc
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 07it's not gonna be spammed so much that anyone gets to 100 fast regardless
<Ascendant> Yeah true
<Ascendant> but lol
<Ascendant> /timer 1000 0 /msg # !fight
<Ascendant> xD
<Kyu> 07and you have to be lucky to beat someone lol
<Ascendant> heh
<Kyu> 07either lucky or spammy =P
<Ascendant> >healing moves
<Kyu> 07also
<Ascendant> hm?
<Kyu> 07maybe you should have a timer that keeps them from attacking the same person more than once in say, 30 seconds or so
<Ascendant> That's fairly easy to do
<Ascendant> it's the same as the rest of my floodkill systems
<Ascendant> that I use for ScriptBot's scripts
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Lyon02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Ascendant> set %scriptfloodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] on | timerscriptfloodkillstuff unset %scriptfloodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ]
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> I mean
<Ascendant> set -u10 %floodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] on
<Ascendant> removes it after 10 seconds

<Kyu> 07like sand-attack
<Ascendant> Ah
<Kyu> 07so flamethrower would be 95%, x accuracy level

<Jason> Thats weirdd
<HyperMetalLugia> Too hot
<nickstr> but it results in something surprising
<Cat> well we're not a very hot country
<nickstr> BETTER THAN FM QUALITY SOUND!
<Jason> Its not common in peru, either
<drf|laptop> 03it was a question about Katy Perry
<nickstr> the full range of human hearing
<Jason> The temp ranges from: 15-25
<nickstr> FM can't go above 15,000 Hz due to the pilot tone
<nickstr> AM can
<Dialga> I at least knew that AM had better quality than FM
<nickstr> not many do
<Dialga> but why is FM preferred for most radio stations?
<nickstr> bad reputation
<nickstr> receiver manufacturers skimp on AM in bad ways
<nickstr> AM is capable of better frequency response than FM and also stereo
<nickstr> I have a setup that actually proves both

<Stormy> I don't think you've told us that
<Mikey> and double strollers suck when they're trying to fit them into the fish place which is barely even wide enough to fit that into when you have three other mothers with their children with you outside and of course YOU HAVE TO SHOVE THAT THING IN AND NOT LEAVE IT WITH THEM OH NO

<HyperMetalLugia> Didn't I..post that?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah you did
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<drfsupercenter> 03I tend to keep those pictures open until I can show them to people
<drfsupercenter> 03yay firefox tabs?
<WhiteTail> 12you know I'm gonna play Portal2 in a bit, STILL not finished it.. too busy all the damn time
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, DRF can finally be a supercenter
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03LL and I beat it
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or..at least WORK in one :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I beat single player on my own
<drfsupercenter> 03then we did co-op
<Quanyails> 7Have fun when you get the chance, Arti.
<drfsupercenter> 03I had actually beaten co-op with someone from HoSHiNET like right when it came out
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's on Steam, and EW STEAM
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't forget to watch out for the spoilers :P
<drfsupercenter> 03you know, it's actually a lot easier to get the Professor Portal achievement on Xbox than it is on Steam
<HyperMetalLugia> They are everywhere
<drfsupercenter> 03for the simple reason that you can make a new account and it will work - but on Steam, that new account would have to also own the game, you can't just pop in the disc and play
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Quanyails> 7Yep about the spoilers
<WhiteTail> 12Thanks Quan, I was trying to earn extra money by designing websites for people

<Manlyguy> I don't really like the Jhen since it takes up so much time to kill, but it's so fun fighting it.
<Craiglol> 03Sometimes
<Craiglol> 03the problem isn't the rare stuff like gems and plates etc
<Craiglol> 03but it's getting all the other crap needed .-.
<Manlyguy> Like? lol
<Drake> 04Not for me.
<Drake> 04I spent AGES trying to get a Deep Dragongem for the Helios set x.x

<Espeon> 06Kinda like 95% accurate moves miss more than the 5% makes you think :3
<Soyuz> what the fuck did Bethseda do to get high
<Soyuz> and then create Oblivion
<Soyuz> There is no way in hell this could be the same company
<Soyuz> that created Fallout 3 and Oblivion
<Angel_Espeon> 13;;
<Drake> 04ikr?
<Craiglol> 03Or games seriously just troll you
<Manlyguy> Which is why you don't need to take them seriously.
<Craiglol> 03it says 95% chance to hit and it's actually programmed to have 5% chance to hit
<Craiglol> 03That would be hilariously cruel
<Espeon> 06Sometimes it feels like 60% accuracy or something
<Espeon> 06and it seems like moves like hypnosis has 90% accuracy for NPC's too. But anyway, it does make things exciting~
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04congrats on kicking Morrowind ass
<Drake> 04but I haven't played Oblivion so I woudn't know
<Manlyguy> Rayyyy. Dang, he promised me a brawl today.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Dark Void is such a broken move
<Craiglol> 03BRAWL?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Darkrai's Bad Dreams ability + nightmare + Dream Eater doesn't help either
<Craiglol> 03DID SOMEBODY SAY BRAWL?
<Craiglol> 03=DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Craiglol> 03Sorry that game makes me excited
<Angel_Espeon> 13when put together, it ends up being complete BS
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13the least they could do is lower Dark Void's accuracy :/
<Quanyails> 7Hint, AE: Have a pokemon with Vital Spirit or Insomnia. :P
<Quanyails> 7Or Sleep Talk. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because having 80% accuracy and putting BOTH Pokemon to sleep in a double battle is just stupid >.> /rant
<Quanyails> 7And Drake?
<Drake> 04aye?
<Quanyails> 7What are the levels of your main pokemon team?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Angel_Espeon> 13At least I now know that Darkrai is, in fact, a pure dark-type and actually has weaknesses |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to think it was ghost-dark until recently
<Manlyguy> I need a brawl. XD
<Craiglol> 03Go kill that basement dweller of a pokemon
<Quanyails> 7Lol, AE.
<Angel_Espeon> 13So Darkrai's actually reallly easy to take down, IF you get the chance to hit it
<Angel_Espeon> 13>.>
<Craiglol> 03Manly I'll brawl you if you give me like
<Craiglol> 0320 minutes max
<Craiglol> 03need to do a handful of things first
<Manlyguy> Sweet.
<Drake> 04uh
<Drake> 04one moment
<Manlyguy> I haven't played online in forever, and I'm dying trying to get a match. Everyone else is too busy today, it seems.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not busy~
<Quanyails> 7I'm open for Pokemon, Manly. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I'm also not motivated~
<Ray> 02I'm open for brawling
<Manlyguy> lmfao
<Drake> 04Quan: Toxicroak is 85, Braviary is 80, Gardevoir is 77, Milotic is 84, Hydreigon is 83, and Chandelure is 80
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, not bad;
<Drake> 04I cbb to train anymore.
<Manlyguy> Which Pokemon game, Quan? I don't have B/W yet...
<Drake> 04I never play online.
<Quanyails> 7You know, I want to test out my six-Hydreigon team. :P
<Ray> 02But warning: my internetz is Failing, like a boss.
<Quanyails> 7And you can only have multiples of a pokemon in open battles or Infrared.
<Quanyails> 7And open doesn't neutralize levels.
<Craiglol> 03Manlyguy
<Quanyails> 7So, yeah.
<Craiglol> 03I am
<Craiglol> 03ALWAYS
<Craiglol> 03free to brawl
<Drake> 04Well I can't play online because of my hidden internet
<Quanyails> 7And Manly: White. D:
<Angel_Espeon> 13How do you guys train up your Pokemon so quickly, seriously? D:
<Ray> 02LOL craig
<Ray> 02xD
<Quanyails> 7Audinos help.
<Ray> 02^
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been casually training up my HG team for the past year now, and are only just reaching lv 80
<WhiteTail> 12I have a slight problem, I am stuck in Soul Silver AND Black in both the exact same places.. the route to the league.. -v- I am just unmotivated to train them up for it.....
<Quanyails> 7I can trade you pokemon to help you get through? :P
<WhiteTail> 12It's been nearly a year with Soul silver now I think
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know what you mean about training feeling like a pain in HG/SS
<WhiteTail> 12Hmm, well Nick traded me a lucky egg to help wth training in SS but I still haven't done anything with it so not sure if that'll help ^^
<Manlyguy> Lol, Craig. I don't come on this chat often, so I wouldn't know, haha.
<WhiteTail> 12Hi Manlyguy!
<SheenaFox|Afk> hey Manly
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just dedicated a lot of time and effort into training right outside that house where someone heals your Pokemon |D
<SheenaFox|Afk> oh whoa my nick
<Quanyails> 7Late, Drake, but okay.
<Manlyguy> Hey. xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13and even then, I only trained them to about lv 42-45
<WhiteTail> 12XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Black/White shouldn't be too bad though, since you've got a Lucky Egg to help o3o
<Quanyails> 7Audinos give LOADS of Exp.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, for people who have fought Kyurem, I have a question
<Craiglol> 03Right brb
<Craiglol> 03and when I get back
<Angel_Espeon> 13how do you get to Kyurem?
<Craiglol> 03Brawl teim
<Quanyails> 7You know that forest, right?
<Ray> 02AE:
<Quanyails> 7Well, there's like this tiny lake in the center of it.
<Quanyails> 7Get to it, and Kyurem freezes the area.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I got to the forest area in Giant Chasm but couldn't work out where to go to get to the stairs on the right
<Ray> 02Through a pineapple, under the sea. [/jk]
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, really?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Maybe that didn't happen because it happened to already be Winter in-game while I was there |D
<Ray> 02Also, what Quanyails said :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Thanks :P
<Ray> 02But PROTIP:
<Quanyails> 7Then you can get to Kyurem's chamber.
<WhiteTail> 12Angel_Espeon have you got storms over there? :>
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nope o.o Just rain
<Angel_Espeon> 13I assume it's rained anyway, since the ground is wet
<Ray> 02you have to do a "Loop run" (or something like that) over that forest in a specific way. because if you don't the tiny lake wont appear.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd sound like such a shut-in if I said I hardly ever look outside the windows when I'm at home |D
<WhiteTail> 12I only looked out when I noticed on Facebook that someone near my house was reporting storms LOL!
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD I personally find it to be a nice change from the bright sunny weather we've been getting recently
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been wanting some "cool-down" days for a while now :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13and despite the clouds and rain it's still fairly warm outside, so I'm perfectly fine with it~
<WhiteTail> 12Yeh it's nice and humid so I'm ok with it XD

<HyperMetalLugia> WB weirdo :3
<Craiglol> 03Thank you
<Soyuz> Drake; bullshit I have
<Soyuz> i'm only on the "visit said tribe and learn what you can from them" quest in the main quest
<Soyuz> I just spent so much time on side quests, and the factions
<Drake> 04lololol
<Soyuz> that I forgot about the main quest
<Soyuz> and being a badass
<Drake> 04Good plan though
<Soyuz> I got 19 K
<Drake> 04Get stronger
<Drake> 04...
<Soyuz> Veloth's Judgement
<Drake> 04I have like, 490K
<Soyuz> Full Redoran Armor
<Drake> 04From summon-abusing
<Soyuz> (I have the entire thing so I'll be richer than uz :P )
<Soyuz> and various artifacts in two places
<Soyuz> one is my manor
<Soyuz> Indray inbetween Ald'Ruhn
<Soyuz> and Maar Gan
<Soyuz> Second is in Pelegiad
<Soyuz> Also
<Soyuz> should I join the Legion Drake?
<Soyuz> I mean I have the Lord's Mail
<Soyuz> and pratically am the best warrior
<Soyuz> i got 100 long blade
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Soyuz> and 85 in Blunt
<Drake> 04Lord's mail doesn't even look cool
<Soyuz> It doesn't
<Drake> 04so I gave it to that dude, then I killed him to become captain
<Soyuz> but Ebony's Mail and Tribunals armor along with Redoran..
<Soyuz> Dear fucking god
<Drake> 04And I got that awesome sword.
<HyperMetalLugia> BRbs, dinner time
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay me
<Drake> 04Magic is AWESOME
<Soyuz> But I don't want to join Imperial Cult
<Soyuz> i fucking hate them
<Drake> 04Don't join them then
<Soyuz> But
<Soyuz> themoneh
<Soyuz> andthequests
<Soyuz> andtheexperience
<Drake> 04I don't think you need to join the cult to join the Legion
<Drake> 04lol
<Soyuz> I know I don't
<Soyuz> I join the Legion via Gnisis
<Drake> 04The cult has you gathering money from commoners and collecting items around cities.
<Soyuz> I know
<Drake> 04It's not worth it
<Soyuz> thats why I hate them
<Soyuz> because they do it for the money
<Soyuz> the Temple has more justice then them
<Soyuz> and its the Temple
<Soyuz> the one that supresses dissdent priests who are partly right
<Soyuz> and partly wrong
<Soyuz> Though I also ask
<Soyuz> should I be a vampire?
<Soyuz> I mean I know i get Spell-Breaker as a item
<Soyuz> and get to kill moar demons for Lord Molag Bal
<Soyuz> but it just seems tedious
<Soyuz> find a specific member
<Soyuz> join the clan
<Soyuz> do their shit
<Soyuz> and then do some quests in Red Mountain
<Soyuz> the most unholy place in Vvardenfell
<Soyuz> AndI found M'iaq
<Soyuz> teh liar
<Drake> 04._.
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04don't become a vampire
<Drake> 04It's not really worth it
<Drake> 04Besides, once you get to a certain part of the main quest it becomes impossible to become a vampire
<Soyuz> I know
<Soyuz> the Corpus section
<Soyuz> I kinda figured that out when you're suppose to go to Tel Fyr
<Soyuz> due to House Redoran
<Soyuz> and your the Nerevarine
<Soyuz> why are to to befall on such simple diseases?
<Soyuz> But I gotta tell you
<Soyuz> alot of the artifacts you find
<Soyuz> like Vampire Ring
<Soyuz> Veloth Judgement etc
<Soyuz> are worth getting for two reasons
<Soyuz> one they're powerful
<Soyuz> two you can sell them to this lady in Tribunal
<Soyuz> which gets you some 30k for each item
<Soyuz> that and i know if I become a vampire
<Soyuz> bad-days for me
<Soyuz> i'd do it only for the quests
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Drake> 04I don't know
<Drake> 04I never became a Vampire
<Drake> 04Wait, do you have Azura's Star?
<Soyuz> Not yet
<Soyuz> I didn't visit her shrine
<Soyuz> but I know itys in the south east part of Vvardenfell
<Drake> 04You really should
<Soyuz> near Molag Mar and some ruins
<Drake> 04even if you don't have a good skill in enchanting, it's worth it.
<Soyuz> because its Azura's star
<Soyuz> and she saves our asses so many times to count
<Drake> 04XD
*Sneas misread Azura as Azure. :3 </:3>
<Soyuz> but yeah
<Soyuz> I could just use console code
<Soyuz> and just become a vampire that way
<Soyuz> do the quests
<Soyuz> and then do the quest for vamprism cure

<Ascendant> I can't find where I put ScriptBot's files

<Anakin> google ftw
<TTEchidna> http://i56.tinypic.com/2uppgxz.png
<Anakin> I'm just worried that searching through this file will be too much for mIRC
<Anakin> do you want to do some of it, Quilava?
<Quilava> eh.
<Icydragon> K cool
<Anakin> XD okay
<Quilava> not particularly, but I suppose it has to get done
<Anakin> nah it's fine
<Anakin> pokemondb.net is a good site for it
<TR_Reed> 14o.o
<Quilava> hopefully its not too much of a pain
<Anakin> nope
<Anakin> just time consuming
<TR_Reed> 14Night everyone
<Quilava> okay.
<Anakin> I'm not doing PP
<Anakin> because that'd make it go full retard
<TTEchidna> Hmm.
<Quilava> did I mention I'm finally getting some commissions again?
<Anakin> uh....
<Anakin> I don't think you did
<Anakin> what's a commission again? xD
<Quilava> probably not
<Anakin> /braindead
<Quilava> its when people pay me to do arts :P
<Icydragon> Sooooo
<Anakin> Nice :o
<Anakin> you're good at art
<Anakin> you should do some for HoR
*Anakin hides
<Quilava> thanks :P
<Quilava> lawl
<Anakin> oh fuck
<Anakin> I just realised
<Anakin> how are we going to do moves like doubleslap and stuff?
<Anakin> I'll just add in an extra field
<Quilava> hm.
<Anakin> the probabilities too...
<Anakin> :x
<Quilava> you could have it check specifically for those ones when it picks an attack
<Anakin> http://pokemondb.net/move/doubleslap
<Anakin> Yeah
<Quilava> probabilities shouldn't be too hard
<Quilava> just $r(1,8)
<Quilava> 1~3 is twice, 4~6 is 3 times, etc
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Anakin> oh true
<Anakin> that's fine then
<Anakin> trying to think of the point of an "effect" field in the database
<Anakin> as in
<Anakin> how would it help the script?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chatroulette-trolling-narnia.jpg
<Quilava> you mean like status effect?
<Anakin> yeah
<Quilava> eh
<Quilava> those don't really seem like they'd be too useful
<Anakin> I could probably remove the effect field
<Quilava> since this isn't ACTUALLY turn based..
<Quilava> things like paralysis would just mean you have to spam fight more
<Anakin> I'm removing most status effects
<Quilava> and sleep. and freeze.
<Quilava> ok
<Anakin> lol, freeze
<Anakin> the only ones I would consider keeping would be sleep, freeze and paralysis
<Quilava> seriously?
<Anakin> but dunno
<Lucia> wadda fuck
<Anakin> I'd definitely not keep poison/burn etc.
<Quilava> how would they work in the script?
<Anakin> ohai Lucia
<Lucia> are you racist
<EpicStatsGuy> Persona, Fursona...what do you call a dragon then?
<Anakin> wb Drake
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Lyon02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Anakin> well
<Lucia> you dont like purple do you.
<Anakin> with paralysis
<Anakin> when they attack someone it'd do a quick calculation
<Anakin> and if it generates a certain result the attack either goes ahead or they're stopped because of the status effect
<Quilava> ..won't that just encourage more spamming of the script?
<junh1024-XD> you won't go anywhere
<Anakin> probably
<Anakin> well, I'll get rid of that then
<SilverSonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDhR7jUjzcY
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Windows Remix: OneStop | by SilverMario1534 | Length: | Views: 6 (0 likes, 0 dislikes, 0 Popularity)
<Quilava> honestly I was seeing it the other way around
<Quilava> where you keep burn/poison and such
<Anakin> Hm
<Anakin> perhaps
<Anakin> but I'd only make them go for a few times
<Quilava> where it takes a chunk of HP every time you attack
<Anakin> otherwise it'd kill them off very quickly
<Anakin> as I think it takes off 1/8 HP each time or something?
<Anakin> dunno, what do you think?
<Quilava> not that much
<Anakin> it was either 1/8 or 1/16
<TTEchidna> http://oi56.tinypic.com/nwf1c5.jpg
<TTEchidna> better version
<Quilava> probably 1/16 :|
<Quilava> then again
<Quilava> you can always just leave statuses out completely
<Quilava> it'll save you from having to write in a bunch of moves too
<Anakin> I might keep them in
<Anakin> just to make it more interesting
<Anakin> can't be that hard to code either way
<Anakin> just more time required
<Quilava> tedious, not hard
<Anakin> yeah
<Anakin> then we have toxic
<Anakin> and burns, which would halve attack as well
<Quilava> because you'll also have to add in probability of effect.
<Anakin> well, I'd just add in an extra field saying the effect, and the script can do its $rand thing
<Anakin> and if it hits that number then it's game
<Quilava> but what about the difference between shockwave and body slam :|
<Anakin> and the effect comes into play
<Anakin> well, if shock wave's prob is 1/10
<Anakin> I put the number as 10
<Quilava> I thought shockwave was always stun
<Anakin> and then do $rand(1,$readini(battlemovedb.txt,shockwave,probability))
<Anakin> or something
<Anakin> shockwave was always hit
<Quilava> oh.
<Anakin> zap cannon always paralyses
<Quilava> I meant, always stun vs chance to stun
<Anakin> if it's always stun then you can either put the number as 1
<Anakin> so it's $rand(1,1) or simply state another field
<Quilava> ..grah, never mind <.>; you put it in anyway
<Anakin> xD sorry .-.;
<Quilava> bleurgh, anyway.
<Ascendant> maaaaaaario
<Anakin> xD
<Quilava> I'm kinda tired, gonna head downstairs. I might be back immediately, or not :|
<Anakin> ah okay, have fun

<junh1024-XD> hi lu
<junh1024-XD> drfsupercenter does what.cd even work for you? cuz it doesn't work for me
<junh1024-XD> would it be better to have some pro restore this video by giving them the original VHS, or my recording in digital? < either source, depenz on how it has aged.
<lightumbreon|ZOO> ohai junh1024-XD
<junh1024-XD> anyway, i doubt a commercial service could do signifigantly better than we can cuz > crap in, crap out, and they'll just run it through whatever crap tools they've got
<lightumbreon|ZOO> well, i'm off anyways, bye
<junh1024-XD> bai
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> anyway, i doubt a commercial service could do signifigantly better than we can cuz > crap in, crap out, and they'll just run it through whatever crap tools they've got <- that depends
<drfsupercenter> 03you could totally do a frame by frame restoration
<drfsupercenter> 03would be tedious and a pain but would work

<drfsupercenter> 03I can author this into VTS and then shrink it
<junh1024-XD> nobody sensible does a frame-by-frame restoration.
<drfsupercenter> 03Lowry digital
*drfsupercenter hides
<junh1024-XD> i've found out, theres avisynth filters that can do almost everything that you want
<drfsupercenter> 03there are plenty of places that do it, just usually for big hollywood movies as it's fricking expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03orly now
<junh1024-XD> yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03as it needs more than just denoising
<drfsupercenter> 03there's tracking lines on the screen, colors are faded, etc
<junh1024-XD> what i think would be appropriate.experimental is
<drfsupercenter> 03also what about audio? That's your field :P
<junh1024-XD> *motion-compensated grain addition, *stabilization, *S,B, YUV, *denoising, *sharpening possibly (but there's no detail to sharpen)
<junh1024-XD> because VHS are what, 240p?
<drfsupercenter> 03not realy, they're analog
<drfsupercenter> 03so they have no resolution
<drfsupercenter> 03they're 480 "scan lines" but yes it would be roughtly 240 I think
<drfsupercenter> 03wgat's S, B?
<drfsupercenter> 03*what
<junh1024-XD> saturation, brightness
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<junh1024-XD> since VHS is analogue, you can capture it at any resolution, including 1080p. but that would not be sensible, because there's not much detail at that resolution.
<drfsupercenter> 03I recorded it at 480i, as >DVD
<junh1024-XD> k, mb 360p then?
<drfsupercenter> 03deinterlacing it with what?
<junh1024-XD> anything that works
<junh1024-XD> video is not a picture, you need to have the content & try stuff to see if it works.
<drfsupercenter> 03well I can never figure out how to deinterlace stuff that was natively analog
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's not like it really has a native digital form
<drfsupercenter> 03IVTC for example would be stupid in this case
<junh1024-XD> audio "is my field" since i have been wrong about video in the past, and people can critisize me for it. audio, noone can because noone knows about ot that much & has the tools to critisize me if i'm wrong.
<drfsupercenter> 03well you did a good job on the Eagle ceremony
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don't suppose you want to try to fix up my parents' wedding :P
<junh1024-XD> I could, but will I?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I said "want to"
<junh1024-XD> well, except Hale on rizon, he's pretty good, he's more of the theoretical dude, he sometimes say stuff that i don't get
<junh1024-XD> i'm more of a practical dude cuz i use the tools
<junh1024-XD> so i would suggest.experimental: *exciting/EQ, *noise reduction, *stereolization
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<junh1024-XD> &mb SRC
<drfsupercenter> 03all I know how to do is normalize, LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03in this case, it's *faded*
<drfsupercenter> 03like
<junh1024-XD> &mb un DRC
<drfsupercenter> 03the parts where there's a band playing music
<junh1024-XD> sound is "muffly"
<drfsupercenter> 03it sounds like an old rec ord
<drfsupercenter> 03*record
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that.
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't know how to fix that
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not like the Boy Scout thing where it was just quiet and staticy
<drfsupercenter> 03the volume is fine, it's just faded
<junh1024-XD> i guess. you can fix it so that it sounds like a LQ mp3
<drfsupercenter> 03using what?
<junh1024-XD> a exciter, possibly.
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is an exciter
<junh1024-XD> it generates new frequencies based on existing frequencies.
<junh1024-XD> ( nickstr might be intested in dis talk, or not )
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<junh1024-XD> LQ i mean 64-96kps stereo
<drfsupercenter> 03well, what would a VHS have normally? Prolly not much better
<junh1024-XD> experimental i mean, to go beyond by what is "safe" and acceptable/usually done.
<junh1024-XD> its analog, but about 48-64?
<drfsupercenter> 03I woulda thought more like 128kbps but whatever
<junh1024-XD> >crap in, crap out
<drfsupercenter> 03because I mean, I've had music videos on VHS, they aren't that bad
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah I know
<junh1024-XD> oh?

<Angel_Espeon> 13Espeon gets the best ability IMO
<Armageddon> +I
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it's my fave, so xD
<Quanyails> 7Primary reason I chose that. :P

<Quanyails> 7Hey, they can pass down Dream abilities. :3
<Espeon> 06something you need some luck to get x.x
<Angel_Espeon> 13You can't SR for suitable nature/gender and such when it's a dream world Pokemon, right? :<
<Espeon> 06( Or in other cases, patience~ )
<Quanyails> 7Nature, you can.
<Quanyails> 7Gender, nope.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Are you able to save in the entralink?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I thought you couldn't o3o
<Quanyails> 7You can't.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But in that case, I want to SR for a good nature/characteristic~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol this guy on DW

<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Also, huge URL is huge
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, DRF?
<Quanyails> 7You know Pokesav?
<jasperdett|laptop> :D
<jasperdett|laptop> i am using synergy right now
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03why?
<Quanyails> 7Do you use it? ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have before, yes
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Quanyails> 7Do you take requests?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess
<Quanyails> 7First of all, can Pokesav randomly generate natures and IVs?
<Quanyails> 7(If you're wondering, I've just been to Smogon's IRC. O.o)
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not really sure
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/04/30/a-computer-that-knows-when-to-say-thats-what-she-said/ < DRF's PC
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'd prefer whatever pokemon is created to be as legitimate as possible except for not being obtainable. :P
<Quanyails> 7Ah, well.
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never had luck making Pok√©mon from scratch
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Quanyails> 7I suppose it's partially me between munchkining and having to decide... morally? (is that the word?) on competitive play.
<drfsupercenter> 03munchkining?
<Quanyails> 7Optimizing stats in a video game.
<Quanyails> 7Like getting max IVs, EV training, yada yada.
<Espeon> 06Well, that's competitive for you.
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Quanyails> 7But I must if I have to win. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Win against who :P
<Quanyails> 7Whoever I'm facing up against.
<HyperMetalLugia> This is why online multi sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> Thank you for being a good person ;D
<Quanyails> 7Ah, not online.
<Quanyails> 7Real life. :P
<Quanyails> 7Where you can't just quit and be happy.
<Espeon> 06I don't care about people "munchkining" myself, as long as they don't become elitist and look down on those not trying as hard as them :P
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 wondertomb
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, what, when..how did pokemon stats become IRL?
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just thinking
*HyperMetalLugia mindbombs
<Quanyails> 7Lol, HML.
<Quanyails> 7Real life pokemon competitions. :U
<drfsupercenter> 03originally I thought you could just use Toxic or whatnot against one of those
<drfsupercenter> 03but what if you teach it moves that heal it
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, those :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I think there's a move that gets rid of conditions?
<Quanyails> 7Eh, Toxic still reaches 16/16.
<Quanyails> 7Heal Bell?
<drfsupercenter> 03porolly
<drfsupercenter> 03and what do you mean 16/16
<Quanyails> 7Toxic does 1/16 damage + 1/16x (where x = turns poisoned) per turn.
<Quanyails> 7So after 15 turns, toxic will do 16/16 damage.
<Quanyails> 7Percentagewise.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you use something like Heal Bell.
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Quanyails> 7Until PP runs out.
<drfsupercenter> 03and then teach it like, Synthesis
<drfsupercenter> 03so it can restore HP too
<drfsupercenter> 03and there's really no way (assuming items aren't allowed) to beat it
<Quanyails> 7Does Miracle Eye work?
<Quanyails> 7On a Wondertomb?
<drfsupercenter> 03what;'s that
<Quanyails> 7It's a move that makes Dark types not immune to psychic attacks.
<Quanyails> 7But ah, wait, that's not super-effective, is it?
<drfsupercenter> 03indeed
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7You could Trick on a Toxic Orb. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03what's that
<Quanyails> 7A hold item that induces toxic on your pokemon.
<Quanyails> 7Helpful for pokemon with Poison Heal.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Quanyails> 7It's like Black Sludge, in a way.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know any of these moves
<HyperMetalLugia> How does that even..work
<drfsupercenter> 03are they 5th gens?
<Quanyails> 7No, actually.
<Quanyails> 7 4th gen items.
<drfsupercenter> 03Miracle Eye isn't?
<Quanyails> 7Miracle Eye is 4th gen as well.
<drfsupercenter> 03weird, I've never heard of it
<Quanyails> 7It's relatively rare.
<drfsupercenter> 03but hmm
<Quanyails> 7Oh, wait; can you Soak a Wondertomb?
<drfsupercenter> 03psychic usually dcan't hit dark? o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03what's Soak
<Quanyails> 7It changes your opponent's typing to Water.
<drfsupercenter> 03hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03you might be able to
<drfsupercenter> 03but assuming you're playing against a random stranger, what's the chances they'd have that?
<Quanyails> 7True.
<Quanyails> 7I missed it when Fire Fang could hit through Wonder Guard.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Quanyails> 7There was a glitch in D/P where the move Fire Fang bypassed Wonder Guard.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only Pok√©mon that can legitly have Wonder Guard is Shedinja though, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03which would mean fire is super effective = that makes sense to me
<Quanyails> 7Yep.

<drf|laptop> 03I'm kinda preoccupied right now
<drf|laptop> 03don't have the hard drive space to just store tses for a while?
<junh1024-XD> I do
<junh1024-XD> & i want you to turn off hyperthreading on your PC on next restart. It makes stuff run faster because of less context switching.
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Umbreon> 12!pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> Umbreon, you are a 2Dwebble.
<junh1024-XD> what?
<drf|laptop> 03I want hyperthreading
<junh1024-XD> becauuse
<Umbreon> 12finally somewhat done sorting cards
<Umbreon> 12i don't know why i insist on not putting cards away until i have a huge mountain of cards
<drf|laptop> 03wtf, the DVD release of Man of the House is 4:3
<nickstr> screw hyperthreading
<nickstr> MULTICORE!
<junh1024-XD> multicores have hyprethreading
<junh1024-XD> (intel's i-series)
<junh1024-XD> so drf, why do you want hyperthreading on?
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is even more epic
<Guest27801> 03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<drf|laptop> 03because showing as 8 CPUs FTW
<drf|laptop> 03that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5%
<nickstr> not really
<drf|laptop> 03not 25
<drf|laptop> 03just my luck
<drf|laptop> 03the region 2 and 4 DVDs of Man of the House are 16:9
<drf|laptop> 03but the American one is 4:3
<nickstr> the radio station for Seattle's public schools on FM is running HD Radio
<nickstr> they must have a TON of money in the budget
<nickstr> its expensive to run the technology because you have to pay license fees to Ibiquity for each stream on top of buying the equipment
<nickstr> the cost for the equipment alone can be $75,000
<nickstr> sounds like a losing technology to me
<junh1024-XD> that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5% < that's a result of it showing as 8 cpus. it is actually stilll using up 25%.
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> because they are VIRTUAL CORES
<nickstr> not physical cores
<junh1024-XD> and with then non-sleeping, singlethreaded programs such as ffox & office that you use, HT off may make them go an iota faster
<nickstr> I have not even touched those kinds of settings
<nickstr> I still have the display of two physical cores
<nickstr> not even going to try hyper threading
<Glaceon> o.o

<junh1024-XD> did you turn off HT?
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<junh1024-XD> >.>
<junh1024-XD> do you understand how HT works ? I didn't say what the task manager shows up, but how it works with task switching.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah well I'd rather just leave it on.
<junh1024-XD> becauuse
<nickstr> even if it works to your detriment
<nickstr> because it will
<nickstr> with single tasking stuff
<junh1024-XD> because it
<junh1024-XD> passes itself between different CPUs. and context passing actually consumes time.
<junh1024-XD> it's small, but adds up to like, 3-7%
<junh1024-XD> It's not actually consuming less CPU on locked tasks, either, but thats unfortunately how it's displayed on windows task manager. linux and unix don't show this bias (where CPU can go above 100%)
<junh1024-XD> I would not suggest this to you, unless i thought it was to your benefit, and it probably would.
<Armageddon> o-O
<Armageddon> ohai LLOTS
<Ascendant> Lol windows.
<nickstr> lol Linux
<Ascendant> linux is awesome.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04so bored
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<nickstr> it can't run 90% of the programs written for computers
<Drake> 04hi
<Armageddon> TCTL
<Armageddon> chapter 7 is up
<nickstr> more like 5% it can run
<junh1024-XD> you mean consumer s0ftware.
<Drake> 04awesome
<nickstr> right
<nickstr> the only programs Linux can run are hobbyist ones and those that have been ported
<nickstr> I simply can't live in a non Windows world
<Armageddon> I actually kinda like it
<nickstr> due to specialized hardware that is not compatible with Linux
<Ascendant> [17:41:39] <nickstr> it can't run 90% of the programs written for computers
<Ascendant> [17:41:50] <nickstr> more like 5% it can run
<Ascendant> consumer/commercial/whatever it's called software
<Ascendant> linux actually has more applications available than windows
<nickstr> BS
<Drake> 04http://techpatio.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/linux_windows_mac_fanboys.jpg
<Drake> 04I think that says my thoughts on the matter.
<Ascendant> it's just the more popular software
<Ascendant> such as word, adobe's crap, etc.
<Ascendant> is available for windows
<Ascendant> as it's closed source
<Ascendant> besides
<Ascendant> open source > closed source
<Ascendant> <3
<Ascendant> and Drake, no one cares about you
<Ascendant> >:3
<Drake> 04Oh well
<Ascendant> ohaidere
<Presea> ohai
<nickstr> one of the Windows only devices I have is a video capture/TV tuner card
<nickstr> its partially because Video4Linux over all sucks
<nickstr> its hardware support is not very good and not improving
<Glaceon> every OS sucks in it's own way
<nickstr> exactly
<nickstr> Windows sucks in some ways
<nickstr> Linux sucks in some ways
<nickstr> Mac OS sucks in some ways
<Glaceon> and embedded OS's
<nickstr> yes
<Glaceon> they all have their faults it's just a matter of picking which one works out best for your needs is all
<nickstr> ugh, don't get me STARTED on the Linksys WRT implementation of VXWorks
<Glaceon> ogod
<Glaceon> VXworks
<Glaceon> i flashed dd-wrt to my router
<Glaceon> >.>
<junh1024-XD> whats so bad about vxworks?
<Glaceon> worked out far better for my needs
<Glaceon> i can even use my router as a access point now
<Glaceon> it's limited for one
<nickstr> I flashed DD-WRT to my router as well
<junh1024-XD> are there any "better" embedded oses?
<nickstr> its greatly more reliable and has far more features
<Glaceon> ya
<nickstr> including some that are normally found in routers that cost thousands
<Glaceon> yes quite fun
<nickstr> such as WOL
<Ascendant> >Video4Linux
<Ascendant> mfw
<Ascendant> linux has some crappy driver support
<Ascendant> and doesn't support stuff that a lot of people need
<nickstr> not so
<nickstr> Video4Linux is something I have had tons of problems with
<Glaceon> linux worked fine with my tv tuner
<Glaceon> my pci one
<nickstr> not mine
<Glaceon> yours is that HD tuner isn't it
<Glaceon> mines just a standard
<Glaceon> >.>
<nickstr> AND ITS NOT FUDGING GOING TO BE SUPPORTED ANY FLIPPING TIME SOON
<nickstr> ugh I hate this censor thing
<Glaceon> censor?
<Glaceon> oh
<Glaceon> +G
<junh1024-XD> +G +kill
<Ascendant> not kill
<Ascendant> it's kick
<Ascendant> !swearstats
<ScriptBot> Number of badwords said for Ascendant: 12.
<Ascendant> yeah, but that's because I don't give a <censored> about swearing.
<Ascendant> shut up

<ScriptBot> You've haven't said any badwords...yet, Glaceon. Well done!
<Ascendant> !swearstats drfsupercenter

<Glaceon> orly
<nickstr> I am mostly here in case I need to talk to drf
<junh1024-XD> <censored>
<nickstr> because he is too narrowminded to go anywhere except here and Pokemon-Orignals
<Ascendant> lolwut
<junh1024-XD> oh, so it got changed from kill to kick
<junh1024-XD> nice
<Ascendant> it was kill before I brought in ScriptBot
<nickstr> because of complaints from myself and a few others
<Ascendant> when Articuno still came on here
<junh1024-XD> well, he does go to disneyunvaulted
<junh1024-XD> but thats a dead channel
<Ascendant> personally I'd not have kicks at all
<Ascendant> but it's not my decision
<Glaceon> anyone under 13 in here
<nickstr> its the decision of the one who is killing the community
<Drake> !swearstats
<ScriptBot> Number of badwords said for Drake: 1.
<Ascendant> <nickstr> its the decision of the one who is killing the community
<Ascendant> that's not me hopefully :x
<Glaceon> dunno who your refering to
<junh1024-XD> nah, that's somewan else
<nickstr> its Arti
<nickstr> she is killing the community
<nickstr> with her isolationism
<junh1024-XD> well, she did come on earlier
<Glaceon> amazing

<Armageddon> u srs?
<MajinMew> probably not

<Armageddon> bbl piano
<Glaceon> i have a PC repair book that's like 4000
<Armageddon> back in an hour and such
<MajinMew> lol'd
<MajinMew> it has a solution to every problem but yours!
<MajinMew> bai Armageddon
<Glaceon> no it really does cover everything
<Glaceon> even down to how ppl tend to abuse their PCs and laptops
<Glaceon> spilling soda on it, etc
<Glaceon> dropping it
<Glaceon> how to replace the mboard of a laptop
<Glaceon> and so on
<Glaceon> detailed specs on many CPU types and speeds from 1970 onward to 2009
<MajinMew> what's a solution for bending your laptop screen all the time
<MajinMew> shit won't close anymore ):
<Glaceon> what's the issue exactly
<Glaceon> is the screen warping when you close it
<MajinMew> define warping
<Glaceon> like it's being pressed from behind
<Glaceon> by the plastic casing
<Glaceon> or is it that you have to push it down harder then normal and your worried about breaking it
<MajinMew> it doesn't have those clicker thingies so it just sits there like uh
<MajinMew> ...WHY IS THERE NO SYMBOL FOR THIS
<Glaceon> clicker thing
<MajinMew> okay | would be shut, and it's all /
<Glaceon> you mean a latch
<Glaceon> oh
<MajinMew> yes
<Glaceon> it's not closing all the way?
<Glaceon> and latching
<Glaceon> sure it's clean
<Glaceon> or didn't come from china
<MajinMew> piece of shit doesn't have a latch
<MajinMew> compaq :L
<Glaceon> china then
<Glaceon> and it's comcrap
<Glaceon> that sucks
<Glaceon> well did you see if anything is out of place
<MajinMew> makes creeky noises when i adjust the top part thing
<MajinMew> idonno ;~;
<Glaceon> oh ya then it's dirty
<MajinMew> How do clean.
<Glaceon> damp cloth
<Glaceon> bairly wet
<Glaceon> canned air also works
<Glaceon> a vaccum
<MajinMew> http://www.netbookin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hp-compaq-presario-cq70.jpg
<MajinMew> this is what i got
<Glaceon> ya the issue would probably be around the side henges
<Glaceon> clean that area as best you can
<MajinMew> alright
<Glaceon> open the laptop screen as far as possible
<Glaceon> and clean inbetween the areas
<MajinMew> crumbs, crumbs fucking everywhere
<MajinMew> woo
<MajinMew> that's slightly better
<Glaceon> years of crap
<Glaceon> lol
<Glaceon> what are you doing eating around a laptop/PC
<Glaceon> anyways
<Glaceon> >.>
<Glaceon> i bet your keyboard is also dirty

<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04whoa
<Drake> 04Spyro should seriously have a difficulty setting.
<Drake> 04And online play for the 360
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yeah
<Drake> 04Would've been so much more fun
<Glaceon> come to think of it i have a spyro game for ps2
<Drake> 04Which one?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Even though the game is easy, it's still extremely Fun
<Glaceon> i think the last one they made for it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Heroes Tail, Enter the Dragonfly, A New Beginning, The Eternal Night or Dawn of the Dragon
<Glaceon> eternal night
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Ah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Didn't really like that one
<Glaceon> lol
<Glaceon> well it's here, but not mine and has been kinda sitting around

<nickstr> its a simple one which some might find questionable

<SilverSonic> xD
<SilverSonic> I use Winamp
<SilverSonic> :3
<Manlyguy> . -.
<SilverSonic> Winamp ftw
<nickstr> AMIP is available for Winamp, Foobar2000, and iTunes
<SilverSonic> its also where i broadcast my Radio Nintendo Show from as well ^^
<Damos> Baby was arrested in Britain for being racist
<nickstr> Winamp is decent for broadcasting
<nickstr> believe me I would know
<SilverSonic> I don't use SAM Broadcaster yet
<nickstr> Winamp+Stereo Tool=WIN!
<SilverSonic> SAM is just too complex for me atm
<Damos> Apperantly it was squinting its eyes when it was born
<nickstr> I still say you should consider a processor SilverSonic
<Damos> It wasn't tired it was doing impressions of chinese people
<SilverSonic> heh
<nickstr> the reason why those 8 bit chip tunes are distorting is because there is quite a bit in the treble
<SilverSonic> heh i dun have enough 8-bit in the show
<nickstr> using a processor will allow you to flaten the audio response out and thus prevent distortion at high levels
<SilverSonic> XD
<nickstr> your apparent loudness could be much higher

<SilverSonic> ahh
<Damos> LOL I know that one
<SilverSonic> and YESH i remixed thee famous Windows Midi
<SilverSonic> <3333
<nickstr> I have never really used it because AM and FM require more of a pre-emphasis
<SilverSonic> Mine doesnt sound like the crap ones ive heard before
<Damos> awesome
<nickstr> FM requires a 75 uS curve in the United States and 50 uS elsewhere in the world
<nickstr> actually 75 uS is used in most of the Americas
<SilverSonic> oh
<nickstr> AM uses a modified 75 uS curve but I found that the European 50 uS FM curve matches this very closely through some research
<SilverSonic> hehe you know alot about broadcasting ^^;
<nickstr> this is only important if you are doing over the air
<nickstr> for internet radio this level is not required
<nickstr> well yea
<nickstr> I have a great deal of interest in the technical side

*SilverSonic Now Playing: S.S.T. Band - Tetremix
<nickstr> I can't really answer that one
<Damos> if you go onto a website like live 365 it can take longer to load than connecting to a radio network with winamp
<nickstr> on FM I had a killer setup which was on a par with the big broadcasters in terms of technical standards
<nickstr> I mean, how often is it that you see a low power FM station with DYNAMIC SCROLLING RDS!
<Damos> you mostly see it when your next to a tower
<nickstr> this was too cool
<nickstr> I was able to send out full song and artist information

<Damos> nighty night
*SilverSonic huggles Damos goodnight

<nickstr> and it seems to work quite well
*Damos||SleepingUnderPalkia huggles back
<SilverSonic> ahhh

*Damos||SleepingUnderDialga sets mode: +pudding Damos
<nickstr> I even killed the audio bandpass filter in the software for a test to see what it could sound like without any filtering
<nickstr> on my wideband AM stereo monitor receiver it put FM to shame
<Max> now what?
<Manlyguy> We wait. See what happens.
<Max> AMIP-wise?
<nickstr> launch your media player
<Max> it's open
<Max> as admin
<nickstr> did you see the text on the status window turn red?
<nickstr> I mean its bar in mIRC
<nickstr> click on that and you should see this

<nickstr> *** Report bugs and wishes to coder@tools-for.net, visit http://amip.tools-for.net for updates
<nickstr> if you see text like that then AMIP is working
<Max> there was no red
<nickstr> but did you see the text I pasted in the status window?
<Max> oh... I see it
<nickstr> try playing a song and then type the trigger

<eXAKR> Oh nice
<eXAKR> http://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?id=176385 <- Pokemon has its own IMCDB page
<eXAKR> It's like IMDB, but for cars
<nickstr> I only recognize two of those
<nickstr> the Harley Davidson motorcycle and the Toyota Dyna
<nickstr> from episodes
<eXAKR> So the police cars they use in the Unova region is based on an actual concept police car in the U.S.
<eXAKR> Interesting
<eXAKR> I recognised that Volkswagen Van
<nickstr> the three others I have never seen in episodes
<eXAKR> I remember watching that episode
<nickstr> not me
<eXAKR> and then, "VOLKSWAGEN?!??!?!??!?"
<nickstr> I quit long before that one aired
<drfsupercenter> 03so nickstr, You Don't Know Jack had a question about FM radio, I got it right
<nickstr> ok
<nickstr> what was it
<drfsupercenter> 03What's the highest legal frequency for FM radio in the US
<nickstr> too easy
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<nickstr> 107.9
<drfsupercenter> 03for some it might not be
<drfsupercenter> 03but yep
<nickstr> here is a more obscure one
<nickstr> who invented frequency modulation?
<drfsupercenter> 03um, dunno
<nickstr> Edwin H Armstrong
<nickstr> well now you do
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<nickstr> another good one
<drfsupercenter> 03there was one about satellite radio too
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently the FCC approved it back in 1992
<drfsupercenter> 03I had guessed 2004, I had no idea it was that old
<nickstr> true or false, AM stations in the US have NEVER been able to run more than 50,000 watts
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm guessing false
<nickstr> CORRECT!
<drfsupercenter> 03finally found working download links
<nickstr> WLW 700 in Cincinatti Ohio ran 500,000 watts in the 1930s under special authorization
<drfsupercenter> 03how far would that reach?
<nickstr> it was heard in Europe nightly
<drfsupercenter> 03wow
<nickstr> as for satellite radio it was in limbo for many years
<junh1024-XD> <eXAKR> http://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?id=176385 <- Pokemon has its own IMCDB page < freaking wow
<nickstr> Sirius was poised to be the first direct broadcast satellite radio provider to ever serve the US
<nickstr> but technical problems resulted in the launch being pushed back to 2001 not long after XM
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that's why I was like wtf at 1992
<drfsupercenter> 03but apparently the FCC allowed satellite radio frequencies that earluy
<drfsupercenter> 03-uu
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> that is when they allocated part of the S band for said purpose
<drfsupercenter> 03S band?
<nickstr> microwave band around 2.3 GHz
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that awfully close to the 2.4GHz that routers and whatnot use?
<nickstr> yes but there is absolutely no risk of bleed over
<junh1024-XD> there's over nine thouSAAAND hertz in between
<Lakorv> 802.11
<junh1024-XD> so yea.
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes I know "802.11" but I'm not quite sure what that means
<drfsupercenter> 03as I've also seen it written as 2.4GHz
<nickstr> designation that the IEEE uses for the technology
<junh1024-XD> its just a random standards number
<drfsupercenter> 03ah

<Hawkie> Lakorv, it depends, I had to ban a few people in my time. Curse of the admin :/
<Hawkie> But
<Hawkie> I have ways with people
<Hawkie> even then they like me
<eXAKR> Gurantee it
<Hawkie> because I'm reasonable
<drfsupercenter> 03Sure
<drfsupercenter> 03what's the command to show uptime in Linux :P
<eXAKR> If this server ever goes down, you remove this server and leave TST forever
<eXAKR> Seriously
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03that seems a bit harsh, don't you think?
<RioX> What
<Hawkie> it's kinda silly for you to be bashing nest though..
<Hawkie> it's unwarranted.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not bashing it
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: staeld@aridhol ~ $ whereis uptime
<Hawkie> well
<Lakorv> uptime: /usr/bin/uptime /usr/share/man/man1/uptime.1.gz
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just saying that statistically this server is a lot better
<Hawkie> you're constantly being down on it.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a fact, it can be proven.
<Hawkie> Eh
<drfsupercenter> 03k, my server has an uptime of 22 days right now
<RioX> Doesn't either one connect to this any time?
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: it's also fact that the USA sucks. Can we just go on?
