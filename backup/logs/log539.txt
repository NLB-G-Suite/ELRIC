<DeadpoolDash> of course the original Street Fighter animated movie is a classic
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: awwww
<Kandarihu> AttackWithHugs, the chat seemed to freeze for me earlier today. I had to reconnect.
<flutter_spin> lol, the movie...
<AttackWithHugs> Nevermind, it's working. Had to refresh it.
<Kandarihu> Um, the Bronycon stream is back.

<cyber_pony13> VenHur96: that wasnt sagat
<VenHur96> Oh...

<HatchetRyda> i didnt think that was him lol
<NewDCD> 09,01Ryu and Sagat meet later in the series
<Polydunami> I'm not too pleased with Chun Li's personality. Isn't she supposed to be a fighter?
<legacyofvrak> I ponified my self five months ago cyber_pony13
<flutter_spin> ehhh Chun Li gets bad later on :P
<Polydunami> Then again, I know next to nothing about Street Fighter
<flutter_spin> And Ryu learns the fireball technique WAY later too
<cyber_pony13> legacyofvrak: did you use pony creator or you made your own work
<Polydunami> Except Ryu, Ken, Cammy, Chun Li, Guile...
<VenHur96> She gets worse? Oh boy..I thinks the Chun Li's fans won't like the later episodes...
<Everlasting_Joy> Everything is syncing up pretty well with the music.
<NewDCD> 09,01DAT FLAWLESS TRANSITION
<Dken2021> critical!

<Everlasting_Joy> SolairePony89: It isn't fairing much better over hear, and that's because we have been watering the lawn.
<flutter_spin> I just love how Ryu and Ken go so well together in the series... as bros I mean
<legacyofvrak> cyber_pony13: I used it and fitted almost perfectly... Is a cutiemark with a Soul Reaver (From Legacy Of Kain)
<Kandarihu> Ponies47, my heart goes out to you.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: :(, and you guys don't have stupid restrictions on them like we do in Minnesota.
<DeadpoolDash> Legacy is the only good live action Street Fighter and it is barely over 3 minutes long
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Tassadork> 105 F is 41C. which is unreal
<appledash6> :O
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: Hey, how long has it been since it rained down here.

<Ponies47> Kandarihu: thanks :(
<Polydunami> Ugh, I fudged my arithmetic :S
*NappyGunny is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: Well that sucks :(
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: some time last week lol
<flutter_spin> light on the clock? ... would seeing the clock alone help?
<MusicalPony> everypony here i personally think is awesome :) just because their a brony :3
<SolairePony89> Cya then NappyGunny
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: To be fair, we can light off fireworks, but they aren't as good as yours.
<Dken2021> Ponies47 wow that sucks, what about 4th of july?
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: Really? It seems like 2 weeks ago.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6but Everlasting_Joy, everyone just drives across the state line for fireworks anyways
<LucidDream> did SB disapear?
<Polydunami> Television, Dken2021 :S
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: Meh. We has limits as well
<Everlasting_Joy> kirzstryfe: True, true.
<LucidDream> Polydunami!
<Ponies47> Dken2021: idk :(
<Polydunami> Oh hey LucidDream
<Dken2021> Polydunami it's not the same :(
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: mom said last week but i could check weather channle and find out
<VenHur96> I was in the bathroom, What I've missed?
<DeadpoolDash> https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/401777_486028961423125_232264891_n.jpg
<flutter_spin> I look outside my window for mine. They have a fireworks night display like a quarter of a mile away.
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: Cool.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6was up in MN last week for vacation, so very boring
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: I didn't say you could get military grade stuff, but they're better then here.
<RyunosukeKnT> suddenly shizukas
<Everlasting_Joy> kirzstryfe: :(, I'm sorry you feel that way.
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: ah I see
<AttackWithHugs> DeadpoolDash: whuut?
<Shizuka> 13where
<LucidDream> So, did they just name Dr Whooves "Time Turner" or have I been not paying attension?
<GabeMoist> there
<RyunosukeKnT> on the stream :)
<Kandarihu> IIRC, it's illegal for people to buy fireworks in Georgia. That's why there are Fireworks shops on the southern border of Tennessee. So that Georgians can cross state lines and get their fireworks.
<DeadpoolDash> new fan project
<flutter_spin> wut? Dr. Whooves got named?
<Dken2021> LucidDream yea, that's what it says on the trading cards
<VenHur96> Is that a real movie poster? If so, UGH! RYU! WHAT THEY HAS DONED TO YOU?!
<LucidDream> yeah
<Polydunami> You guys celebrate on Wednesday, right?
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: I'm in Michigan right now. SO BOOOOORED!
<AttackWithHugs> tch-tch
<Tassadork> it's ryu as interpreted by tim burton
<Kandarihu> Yup. Dr Whooves' official name is Time Turner. Octavia's name is now canon as well.
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: same in minnesota... if you follow I-94 east into wisconsin, the two signs you will see the most at exits are CHEESE and FIREWORKS
<SolairePony89> Polydunami: Yeah, it's Wednesday
<flutter_spin> I should check the bronycon summary
<GabeMoist> dat face
<Shizuka> 13thing is we have trees and people are stupid and set off the big booms in forested areas... it's no wonder they're illegal
<DeadpoolDash> The Dark Stalkers series and OVAs are neat too
<Polydunami> Oh my
<VenHur96> Tim Burton's making a Street Fighter movie?! LE GASP!
<LucidDream> I guess hasbro didn't want to conflic with BBC :/
<VenHur96> ....I'm fine with it.
<LucidDream> Dr whooves is a way better name IMO
<SolairePony89> Cheese and fireworks are best combo
<Ponies47> Shizuka: HEY! We all don't grow dairy products in Wisconsin! :d
<Polydunami> It's crazy: my country celebrates its independence TOMORROW.
<d3rb> must...stay..awake
<Tassadork> VenHur96: not actually, but it lkinda ooks like it
<kirzstryfe> 8,6then you're in the wrong state Ponies47 :p
<Kencolt> LucidDream: And a nice little gateway for Hasbro to get possibly sued.
<SolairePony89> CHOOOOOOO
<Shizuka> 13but seriously it's like every second exit all the way to madison is a giant sign that says CHEESE
<LucidDream> Sad Panda
<appledash6> im watching mega python vs. gatoroid is it a good movie6_9
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Shizuka: Wow
<Dken2021> I could go for some cheese, especially mozzerela
<Polydunami> Let's see... on Polydunami's schedule on celebrating Canada Day... give blood at 11:30am.
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, need to sneak cheese across the border?
<LucidDream> Kind of ironic, since Dr Who refferences pop culture all the time
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: There's a joke in there somewhere.
<Kandarihu> Earlier this evening, someone a street away from me was shooting off fireworks that could be seen from behind the trees.
<superretroworld> whos dr who?
<NewDCD> 09,01DEM CHINAMEN CAN FLY
<DeadpoolDash> here is the guy making the movie poster movie http://vitorugo.com/index.html

<Polydunami> Well, d3rb, my blood type is O Negative. So my blood is kind of important :3
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: I got dragged into it. I had to spend 7 hours in the car with 6 other poeple we have done nothing yet and I'm bored. Then we will be driving the 7 hours back on Monday. We make pit stops from time to time, I'm thinking about singing the MLP theme in public or just playing an MLP song really loud :P
<LucidDream> made the TARDIS?
<superretroworld> Dken2021: oh yeah i remember that show, i thought you they meant a character
<VenHur96> Idk what my blood type is though...hmm.
<LucidDream> more like stole... right?
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: says it rained here last on the 25th
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: but just a little
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: That's Georgetown. Look up the one for Columbia.

<Jim> yeah, where the puck are all those pucks coming from?
<Polydunami> I didn't say I hated it, GabeMoist. I very much like the First Doctor's character.
<Kencolt> They should just puck off already.
<Dken2021> they had pucks stashed all across the city, in case of puck emergency
<GabeMoist> Polydunami, I like the 1st doctor as well, but the 3rd is my favorite

<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/sjiR2.gif
<Kandarihu> Well, that's kind of their weapon of choice. They probably kept a lot of pucks on their outfits.

<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: Awesomesauce. Also, dat CMC cape
<HatchetRyda> Ponies47: and i try and help her with helping her friends not be sad lol
<Tassadork> cyber_pony13: usually the studios only roll out false torrents for big new releases, highly doubt MLP warrants it. but you never know, could get your IP recorded
<pony_6813> HOW'D THEY GET DAT COSTUME??? I WANT :(
<RAWRity> I commend the person who wore that in the middle of New York in JUNE.
<GabeMoist> NJ
<Ninjazz> RAWRity: Saw that on stream. It was pretty good looking actually.
<RAWRity> fucker must've been hot as satan's daddy sack.
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: They have balls/tits of steel
<Ponies47> HatchetRyda: I don't like seeing other ponies sad.
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: lol
<Kencolt> Lone_Lycan: The only frormal, which is to say scheduled, stream is Brony Movie Night. Anything else is whatever a mod decides to put up, and be awrned-- I do mean anything.
<RaveBrony> Is that counted as a furry cosplay (suiter) ?
*MahBoi777 hugs RaveBrony
<HatchetRyda> Ponies47: cant stand that either...very emotional person so it gets to me XD

<Lone_Lycan> so i ask again
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Same
<Lone_Lycan> is the stream over yet? what time will the stream be over?
<VenHur96> I did been in a Clifford outfit for halloween as a toddler, but that's it...really...that's...it.
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: Classy as fuck
<RAWRity> This is pretty cool, save for it thinking Vinyl would use a mac: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/483196_379544338767599_1060177548_n.jpg
<SolairePony89> Lone_Lycan: It ended a few minutes ago. No idea how long it'll take for someone else to start streaming, though
<Polydunami> I see the stream has ended
<VenHur96> Is that a....iMixer?!
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Yeah. I mean my brother and I we're fighting earlier today and my step brother keept trying to get into it as well which he did. So now I'm giving em the slient treatment :)
<VenHur96> It's has the Apple logo...what's to call it...hmm...
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: 100/10, would bang.
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: HEY lol
<Vordox> Oy NewDCD You still here?
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: If possible, silent treatment for life.
<RAWRity> Not sure if hat, or really cool hair: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/582553_132912853513076_2116512163_n.jpg
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: Have you seen that dude with the mixtable?
<pony_6813> IF THAT WAS HAIR THAT WOULD BE COOL
<SolairePony89> RAWRity: Is it weird that the first thinmg I noticed was Tara?
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: guessing hat, that kid does not have the look to pull that off normally
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Maybe because my brother is such a jerk.
<VenHur96> Why my hair can't be rainbow-y and epic?
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: ok, i admit...i'd bang him too but thats not the point lol
<Ingwaz> oh hay, didnt even see tara on there for a second
<Ingwaz> shes a fairly attractive woman
<RAWRity> Ingwaz: could be just a temp style for the con.
<Kencolt> VenHur96: Because we were born in a world where genetics makes sense.
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: either way, he cant pull that off
<RAWRity> there's lots of hair dye and stuff that can be washed out after a couple days.
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: see? common ground. Now shush and eat your oatmeal
<VenHur96> Kencolt: CURSE YOU GENETICS!!!
<Polydunami> VenHur96, CURSE YOU Link!!!
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Heh, he's a jerk? Ignore them both and when/if they need your help with something, the rejection hammer shall rear its head
<Polydunami> ... Next time I play Ocarina of Time, I'm naming Link "GENETICS".
<VenHur96> The Ponys with The BEATLES?! ...Mindblown.
<HatchetRyda> and im back
<pony_6813> HatchetRyda:WAZZAP
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Yeah. My brother is jerk treats me like garbeag, makes fun of me all of the time. My step brother who I only see once a year for a month has pissed me of so many times I've lost count
<Lone_Lycan> BLEACH TIME!!
<Ponies47> *garbage
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Has he been doing that before you were a brony?
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: He's always have. He seems to be doing it more now since I became a brony.
<Polydunami> Hey Bloodmane!
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Have you tried reasoning or asking your parents to defend your sie?
<Bloodmane> Polydunami... My old friend. Hi.
*Bloodmane hugs Polydunami
<VenHur96> Ponies47: Wow...your brother's a jerk...I wished Chuck Norris hunt him down.
<Polydunami> I've been distracted from Bronystate over the past few days, Bloodmane :S
<Kencolt> Ponies47: One more kid not allowed on my lawn.
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Yes I have. My mother has told him to knock it off but he NEVER listens to my parents anymore
<Polydunami> ... Mainly by Doctor Who.
<Bloodmane> Why so, Polydunami? Although it's realyl good to see you again.
<Bloodmane> Ah.
<Bloodmane> That'd be a good reason. :D
<Ponies47> VenHur96: I wish a football jockey would beat the everlasting crap outta him
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Don't worry, it'll come back to him later. Karma is a bitch, after all.
<Ponies47> Kencolt: wo O_O
<VenHur96> Ponies47: So true... *sigh*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Karma? Bitch?
<HatchetRyda> Ponies47: a football jock who is also a brony, just for irony lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> We talking about League of Legends?
<VenHur96> At least my brother isn't like yours, he's cool.
<Kencolt> Excuse me for a moment-- probably be back, nevrknow...
<Polydunami> I've been going through from the very beginning in 1963.
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: No. You should get The Manliest Brony in the world to have a word to your brother.
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: that should work
<CrimsonPhoenix> AttackWithHugs, what's his name again?
<Ponies47> HatchetRyda: yeah :p

<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Well if you have any special occasions coming up in your life, don't invite him or don't tell him at all
<MusicalPony> i love this ef radio... its awesome
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I forgot about it when I changed my name from "Canadian_Brony" to "Lunar_Brony". At first, it was because I said Celestia banished me to the moon, but I had to drop that. I'm still using the name, but I'm not on the moon
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Thanks guys, :) I am listening to music right now. I'm listening to Nightmare Night - [WoodenToaster + Mic The Microphone] WoodenToaster
<RAWRity> seriously though, just HEARING an updated Kanto gym leader theme is enough to get me to buy B/W2
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I'm listening to AcousticBrony's Pony Themes
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Yeah. I don't think I'm gonna invite him to my wedding nor is he gonna care.
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: oh i didnt reconzige you were Canadian_Brony
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: There's alwasy great pony music :)
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: congrats on your wedding, though (all bad things aside)
<Ponies47> *always
<RAWRity> also, if translastions of screenshots are to be believed, B/W2 will have it where, when 1 repel runs out, you can choose to immediately use another one instead of having to go into your inventory.
<HatchetRyda> Ponies47: oh you're getting married? congrats
<MusicalPony> mepp
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: Dude I'm only 14! I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE! :D
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld that's OK. I still use Canadian_Brony from time to time, but I do prefer Lunar_Brony
<HatchetRyda> Ponies47: oh whoops lol
<Ponies47> HatchetRyda: It's ok :)

<Alchemist> Some of the earnings went toward charity right?
<SolairePony89> I'd hope so
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14it was a nice poster, but it outsold custom one-of-a-kind stuff signed by the guests
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14also, half the stuff went to charity
<CrimsonPhoenix> >MicTheMicrophone >Anything other than egotistical and talentless (no Fimfiction hasn't been hacked, just felt like venting. Think of it like a drive against cancer! (You all hate cancer right?)
<Alchemist> great :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh my god
<MahBoi777> well that's good
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love FimFicition
<CrimsonPhoenix> FimFiction**
<SolairePony89> SaxyJanitor: What was the highest price that something went for?

<SaxyJanitor> 0,14yep, SolairePony89

<Midnight_Fyre> SaxyJanitor: Didn't know he quit. I know he was in colege when he started. Anyway, I think in running a blog like this, which could drop in popularity in a couple years time, would lead one to be sort of frugal with the profits
<JRP2234[iPhone]> I feel stupid and contagious.. Here we are now... Entertain us
*DeathStar hugs Pinkies4thWall|Sick and gives some chicken soup
<oni_link> JRP2234[iPhone]: nirvana much?

<SaxyJanitor> 0,14yeah, I live in NYC, so no reason to be at a hotel

<CrimsonPhoenix> also watch the show
<SolairePony89> RAWRity: Well, yeah. Hasbro would their shit torn up. Just saying I perfer Dr. Whooves

<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: :$
<Vordox> Ponies47: Nono, it's the bronies that take everything for granted, AND saying things they should not say cause they are not a part of the thing they mention
<ingwaz> RAWRity: i've heard its "acceptable" but not great
<Vordox> Shizuka: Try a speed drawing

<Ponies47> oni_link: There really pissing in me off. They even went down so low they disconnectec the adapter to the laptop I'm using and took one of the parts. How low can they get? Very very very low. And my brother is calling me a (squee)hole :|
<Ponies47> *disconnect
<Malavolent> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: That soundbox should be installed by default on all deaf people's phones!
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> YES
<oni_link> Malavolent: what version of Android is it running?
<oni_link> Ponies47: why are they doing this?
<Malavolent> oni_link: 2.3, upgradable to 2.4 once it comes out.
<Ponies47> oni_link: Because there (squee)holes and have nothing better to do but jsut ruin my life and depress the (squee) outta me :|
<Vordox> Shizuka: Mind if I link a possible video you can use?

<oni_link> ?
<oni_link> Ponies47: ah i know that feel all too well
<Malavolent> oni_link: 2.3 = 3.0 as well 2.4 = 4.0 I don't know who came up with that, 2.x is used in my country.
<oni_link> Malavolent: over here 2.3 is gingerbread, 3.0 is Honeycomb (tablets only) and 4.0 is ICS
<Ponies47> oni_link: THnak goodness my step brother only gets to come out once a year for a month and then he has to be in Washington (state) the rest of the year. My brother wel lI'm stuck with him. I have no faith and trust in him at all anymore :|

<Vordox> Shizuka: No response, so I'll say, I*m listening.^^
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Shizuka: it's okay...
<Malavolent> oni_link: Honeycomb is 2.3 and Gingerbread 2.3.3 here. It's confusing, really.
<Ponies47> oni_link: He's treated me like garbage. If I insalt himhe punchs me, he's always a jerk, doesn't care about anything but for video games, and a bunch of other (squee) :|
<oni_link> Malavolent: whoa, i think ill stick with the code names :D
<Marx> Getting off for the night. I'll be back for day 2 of Bronycon.
<Ponies47> Shizuka: I am. The music is helping me calm down a bit.

<Ponies47> oni_link: That's ehat it seems liek to me :/
<Malavolent> oni_link: Yeah, that's better. Anyway, I like how Android names the versions of the OS, like 4.0 is named Ice cream.
<Vordox> YOu ccould always go Nostalgic, or something more well known to spark reactions.
<JRP2234[iPhone]> I went to a thingy at a church with the water
<Ponies47> *what
<Malavolent> Vordox: Hard rock?
<Vordox> Or if you wish to try and "draw out" something newer, perhaps onlyshow the good ones to get some recognition for new stuff.
<Vordox> I dunno

<Vordox> Shizuka: But to me, it sounds quite decent

<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: I have a cat. But I try not to tell anyone about her shes my onlly weakness ^-^ I love her to pieces. She's only a few months and she is baige with black paws I named her ki-la la and she is very cuddly whenever I'm doing anything sitting down really she will curl up on my lap.

<Vordox> Shizuka: Do you have any "Badumppppphhhh" songs? XD
<Shizuka> 13but i am certain it will not play nice with FMLE
<Shizuka> 13procaster would do it i'm sure..
<Vordox> Something with a "boom"?

<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i've been meening to play one of the myst's
<Vordox> Wait..this song sounds familiar....
<Vordox> Where have I heard this before.
<Shizuka> 13it's one of the defaults with fruity loops, part of it was used in Loops of Zen on kongregate
<Shizuka> 13beyond that, iunno
<Vordox> Weird, it gives me a vibe of an old Genesis game.
<Vordox> Something is clicking, but not sure where.
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: -lol......fruity loops...sounds like what I used to call cereal as a child.
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Iron_Edge> Vordox: Best genisis game ever. "Vecctor Man!"

<Shizuka> 13i am not sure
<Shizuka> 13i know the expansion they released last month added full coop for the campaign
<Vordox> Oh Shizuka if you want something interesting to listen to, I recommend you listen to a few songs from a game called Shatter.
<Iron_Edge> Vordox: No clue. But I grew up with Vector man. So yeah...http://www.weknowwii.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/vectorman2.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02there is a demo

<Iron_Edge> Vordox: dat be VectorMAN
<Shizuka> 13it is very draining mentally
<Phase4> 00,02lol, the tf2 linux server
<Phase4> 00,02dumps the eula to the terminal
<Phase4> 00,02no less, just all to the terminal

<Vordox> Iron_Edge: Still doesn't look like Vector, FALSE ADVERTISMENT!'
<Vordox> Shizuka: Civ music. <3

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tumblr is a weird place...
*XAX takes the walk of shame back to CSS.
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: yah heard a bit about it but never saw somethign from it ^^
<NotVordox> So Shizuka What music do you prefer?
<Shizuka> 13totalbiscuit did a WTF IS on it

<XAX> Shizuka: your servers, like TF2 or Gmod, do you host them yourself?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, dx:hr has good music
<NotVordox> This music type?
<NotVordox> Hmmm...
<NotVordox> Ameno? Like that band, Shizuka ? :P
<Shizuka> 13i usually avoid lyrics cause i run the playlist all the time
<Shizuka> 13lyrics interfere with code
<VioletGreySha> this song is so epic
<NotVordox> Progressive Harmonics with light choir....
<NotVordox> Hmmmm, what other songs can link to that...
<Shizuka> 13progressive trance is my home genre, ambient comes next, especially in the vein of the Myst OSTs
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: This song makes me wanna play custom robo.
<XAX> i give up on talking until i finish this download. when i download things, it leaves none of my net for anything else.
<NotVordox> I'm not that into Trance music types, so I cannot actually "point" anywhere where you may find new things.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Ghosties
<NotVordox> But for Ambient, I recommend Super MEtroid OSts. :P
<XAX> Toasties
<Shizuka> 13A State of Trance is where i picked up a handful of the tracks i used in the cathedral mixes
<Ghosties> 04Hello everyone
<VioletGreySha> my music type is mostlike Metal but i still like to hear something else sometimes :3
<VioletGreySha> hay Ghost
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Thats why this sounds so familiar!
<Iron_Edge> Ghosties: Sup bro /)
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties:
*NotVordox takes a Ghost Buster gun and sucks Ghosties into a trap and puts it beside him on the DJ table.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Ghosties
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> ohai Ghosties. I hope you're feeling better than i am.
<Phase4> 00,02wait....
<Shizuka> 13i throw in classics like metallica and the one album of rob zombie i have from time to time
<ACS13123> Hi Ghosties :3
<Phase4> 00,02is this downloading all of tf2
<Shizuka> 13probably
<Shizuka> 13the server has to understand everything
<ACS13123> Phase4: lolwut?
<NotVordox> Oh Shizuka !
<NotVordox> Got any "spooky" trance music?
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, setting up a linux dedicated server
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Ghosties: are you a wizard who can cure me?
<Ghosties> 04How is everyone doing?
<Shizuka> 13spooky no
<ACS13123> Phase4: Most likely then :/
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Ghost30k: sick
<ACS13123> C418
<ACS13123> :3
<Shizuka> 13anthem trance is what most of my favorites fall into
<NotVordox> How 8 bit trippy music this is...
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, on linux
<Shamroc> Ghosties: dooin good
<Shizuka> 13C418 composed the Minecraft OST
<Ghost30k> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: What?
<otakon> hiya Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04And unless you count me telling you "get some medicine, 4thWall" then no, I am not nore will I ever be a wizard
<Ghost30k> uhhh hi?
<Shizuka> 13this is off his Seven Years of Server Data album
<otakon> Shizuka: so, any chiptune stuff?
<Ghosties> 04*nor
<MahBoi777> hi Ghost30k
<ACS13123> Phase4: So, its your own server then?
<MahBoi777> UGH
<Shizuka> 13ah ja and i have probably 100 tracker files

<NotVordox> Noone has asked for ponies :P
<ACS13123> Phase4: Wuts the ip gonna be :p
<otakon> god this is the longest I've been up in awhile
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Ghosties: you're still amazing. :)
<Shizuka> 13this is about the only one off that album i liked enough to throw in the potpourri list
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, not public yet
<NotVordox> Oh Shizuka ! Heard the VVVVVV sound tracks?!
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Ghosties> 04Lol thanks
<Ghost30k> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: what's the "sick" for?
<NotVordox> Recommend you take a listen to them, they have an interestin mix you may enjoy
<Shizuka> 13not much into pixel perfect platformers
<NotVordox> Hopefully
<NotVordox> Nono, the music of course.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Ghost30k: because i am sick
<otakon> Shizuka: argh I hate those
<Shizuka> 13ja but it dampens my interest in their soundtracks usually
<Ghost30k> so why'd you tab me?
<NotVordox> Shizuka: Mind I take 1 or 2 songs that I can request then?
<Shizuka> 13last of interest in the game translates to not looking up the OST
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Ghost30k: Tab fail. Meant to ping Ghosties
<Shizuka> 13oh now i see the problem, i forgot to actually put the Myst OSTs in the list
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: I wouldnt entirely say that. Certain games blow as far as gameplay etc... but the sountrack is sick.
<Ponies47> Chat derp back
<Ghost30k> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: ahhh ok lol my bad :$
<otakon> Shizuka: have ya given Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World The Game a look? the OST is good stuff imo
<Shizuka> 13mooooood whiplaaaaaaaash
<NotVordox> So mind I request 2 songs?
<Phase4> 00,02RAGE
<Polydunami> It's sad... I've just read through the transcripts of the Marco Polo serial from Doctor Who. It's something that should not have gone missing :(
<Ghost30k> otakon: THANK YOU THAT OST IS DA BEST

<Rain> so soothing~~
<NotVordox> ...
<otakon> but I can't place it
*Pinkies4thWall|Sick hugs CupcakeWarrior
<Ponies47> Hi CupcakeWarrior :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> soothing :3
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Thats how I know your twisted in the head like pyro. Who listens to THIS while spreaing blood shed and setting the world on fire???
<NotVordox> I found the perfect movie to B movie...
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Pinkies4thWall|Sick
<Shizuka> 13credits song for Angel Beats!
<Polydunami> Hey, I've been rather distracted from Bronystate over the past few days.
<Shizuka> 13Iron_Edge: IKR

<Rain> yup~~
<NotVordox> DAT MOVIE for b!
<otakon> Shizuka: ah... THE ANIME I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON TO THE 100th POWER!
<Shizuka> 13Iron_Edge: actually the better example is on wednesday when the update dropped
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> need a vivi one too
<Shizuka> 13We Didn't Start The Fire is what came up
<otakon> NotVordox: I got a better one, Birdemic
<otakon> BIRDEMIC
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: so many bubbles and rainbows......I still have nightmares...
<NotVordox> otakon: Nah, I prefer something called "quality"
*otakon laughs manically
<Polydunami> Shoot, I KNEW I recognised this, Shizuka :S
<GrimGallop> I actually watched that not too long ago
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d4l0l42
<Ghost30k> Anyone here got a PS3?
<otakon> NotVordox: it's TERRIBAD like The Room
<otakon> Ghost30k: here.
<GrimGallop> No, it's not
<NotVordox> I'm not wasting1 and a half hour for watching soemthing that's has no effort in it
<GrimGallop> The Room has nothing on Birdemic
<Ghost30k> otakon: what games?
<otakon> Ghost30k: no MP stuff except for Scott Pilgrim.
<Phase4> 00,02urgh, half an hour to copy
<Shizuka> 13oh also
<Phase4> 00,02where did i leave that ethernet cable....
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d4nju5r
<Ghost30k> otakon: Scott Pilgrim has MP? o.O
<otakon> GrimGallop: um... ARE YOU KIDDING? Birdemic I think is worse than the room
<otakon> Ghost30k: yeah...co-op man. but I don't think it has online co-op...crap
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> shizu you basicly kill me with that one .... i'll try my best..
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Ghost30k> ohhh that's what i thought luls
<Ghosties> 04I thought they added drop-in co-op now
<Polydunami> My goodness, that Pyro's high on his own fumes xD
<Ghost30k> Ghost30k: ads
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pyro made the term Insanity O_O
<Ghost30k> wow talking to my self IMA PRO :D
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka in a nutshell.
<GrimGallop> I meant on a scale of badness. If you were looking for the worst possible movie to watch with a bunch of friends to make fun of, Birdemic wins hands down.
<Polydunami> I need to rest, for I give blood tomorrow.

<GrimGallop> One of my friends got Birdemic from a nreaby Family Video for 50 cents. After the movie, I asked him if Family Video was like the shop from those old Block Blister skits...

<Rain> well yeah.
<NotVordox> Rain: And the other one you drew yourself?

<ACS13123> O woah
<Mutterguy> Carmen Buranda...
<NotVordox> GOd darnit Rain...
<ACS13123> my internet is derping
<Shizuka> 13Screen Behind The Mirror used O Fortuna a lot, but it's so awesomely done
<ACS13123> SO bad
<NotVordox> Dat PLot is hereby SOPA'd :P
<Ninjazz> Oh mai~
<Rain> I have tried, NotVordox. problem is /artistic block/
<NotVordox> Shizuka: But...but...O Fortuna is too good to be remixed.D:
<Shizuka> 13writer's block
<Shizuka> 13i has..
<Rain> I sit there for hours trying to draw something and nothing comes out..

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> o
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: I look at that and think of the fish things from blue six.
<Polydunami> I know that bodysuit all too well :S
<Shizuka> 13amazing what a teeny bit of blur did for that pic when i blew it up
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Or maybe zero suit...but red
<Iron_Edge> IDK
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Polydunami: lol
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, where the rock starts sloping more level, that didn't exist in the original pic
<Shizuka> 13nor did the background clouds
<Shizuka> 13nor was she facing right..
<Shizuka> 13or straight up
<FairysHuff> Sticking your face in a sink full of water certainly helps to wake you up.
<Polydunami> Hm? Did I say something funny? @_@
<Shizuka> 13basically i found a pic and edited it a lot and abused content aware fill and it came out beautiful~
<Rain> hehehe
<Rain> shizu is best abuser of tools :3
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Well done madame well done. All my internets to you.
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Shizuka> 13http://www.vortalcord.net/ it's shrunk down from the master size
<Polydunami> Tomorrow is a busy day for Polydunami. After all is said and done, I watch the next Doctor Who serial.
<Shizuka> 13twister OST is awesome btw :3
<Cobellanez> Goodnight everyone, going to fall asleep to this stream

<Iron_Edge> Cobellanez: Later /)
<Cobellanez> (\
<Polydunami> Up next is "The Keys of Marinus".
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Cobellanez.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Finally watched some cr.who huh?
<APS> whose streaming?
<Polydunami> Ehehe :$
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: I know that all too well. You tagged that image all over my base when I was going solo >:3 so i got to die seeing it and re-spawn as well..
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Ghosties> 04I believe Shizuka is streaming
<Rain> j a^
<Rain> ja ^*
<Polydunami> I knew the Marco Polo serial was missing so I found and read through the transcripts today.
<Shizuka> 13there :3
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: Thanks for the instrumentals. I love instrumental music. So easy to listen to and relax without vocals pouding into my brain.
<Polydunami> I'm going to have to do that a lot over the next coming days :S
<Shizuka> 13iker
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> 0123 4567890
<Ninjazz> Ohai Asuka.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Which Dr.Who did you start with?
<Shizuka> 13i love that guitar wail
<Polydunami> I started at the very beginning
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Ohai there dying image have we met before...
<Polydunami> With William Hartnell and everything
<Rain> wait, random memory flash. did Iron_Edge say he was going to draw me?
<otakon> okay that's it
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: I reccomend a band called Two steps from hell. Sounds like a metal band I know but they do instrumental epic music.
<Shizuka> 13ohai otakon
<otakon> can't stay up no longer though I want to
<Iron_Edge> Rain: *takes spy ciggerete out of my mouth and speaks in fancy* Zis is correct.
<Rain> sleep well, otakon
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Ah so you found a place to watch them then?
<otakon> Shizuka: been here dear... just quiet bc zoning out due to tired

<Iron_Edge> otakon: yes?
<Ninjazz> EDGE!

<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: WAT?? >:3
<Ninjazz> Thank you WTF is.
*otakon thinks and thinks.
<Ninjazz> Iron_Edge: Oh you.
<otakon> TO GOOGLE!
<Polydunami> I'll see you guys... next time I see you, I guess :$
<KiwiBoi777> GOOGLE
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: No I was just trolling cause ya' know the OST has a part of my name in it..
<KiwiBoi777> bye Polydunami! take care
<Ninjazz> I'm clever enough to figure that out, Iron_Edge. :D
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick2> Okay this is fucking stupid. I have to have two browsers open. chrome so i can see the stream, Firefox because when i type in Chrome it looks like this: 1234567890
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: I love me jrpgs. Not enough of them get released in the UK though. Is sad. ~_~
*DeathOrangeJelly dances
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick2> FML
<Shamroc> otakon: google is the only answer
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Maybe but im not clever enough to know you took the hint :3
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: I got a premium account btw
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall|Sick2: dude, just stick with Firefox
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: And ma' baloonicorn
<Shamroc> Iron_Edge...eek you spent 18$ on that thing..
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick2> otakon: but stream doesn't work on FF
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: So if you need any material etc...give me your list and ill give you whatever you need.
<Ninjazz> Wow this song. :O
<Shizuka> 13silly winamp i told you stop after current
<Shizuka> 13here is some sleepy for otakon
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall|Sick2: dude, check your flash bc if mines working yours shold be
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: Oh no. I got it as a surprise gift.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick2> otakon: all i get is a white box
<Shamroc> Iron_Edge...what do you mean? well i need 3 direct hits to make the new rocket launcher
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: -lol 18 bits for a ballooon?? :D
<GrimGallop> Ooo, Lilium
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: clear cache, check flash
<Rain> dat lilium
*GrimGallop has a midi of this as his ringtone
<Shizuka> 13two versions of the song
*Rain sings along~~
<otakon> this song...WHERE have I heard it before?
<Shizuka> 13plus like three others at the end
<otakon> sounds like Persona
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: Special boxes that when activated on the stage give random gifts out to so many ponys.
<Shizuka> 13Elfen Lied
<otakon> oh
<Shizuka> 13a.k.a. one of shizu's first animes that's very good but that she will not stream
<otakon> sounds like the Velvet Room to me
<GrimGallop> Elfen Lied is totally appropriate for a MLP room. You should stream it sometime.
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: And ok. I'll start collecting them.
<FairysHuff> otakon: It's from a very gory anime
<otakon> Shizuka: it's screwed up a bit eh?
<Shizuka> 13basically
<Ghosties> 04Elfen Lied is definitely pushing it
<otakon> FairysHuff: I know what it's from, I've heard.
<Ninjazz> Ah. The song that never got the official part. They're all fan made remixes basically.
<DeadpoolDash> kite
<Shizuka> 13the first six minutes are a naked girl tearing people apart with psychic powers
<Ghosties> 04Gore galore and fan service out the wazoo
<Iron_Edge> This makes me want to play Assassins Creed...
<DeadpoolDash> mezzo forte
<Iron_Edge> Or maybe Twilight Princess....
<Shizuka> 13and every episode after someone is similarly torn in half with massive fountains of blood
<Shamroc> Iron_Edge: you got a pile of secret saxtons? the one that gives a gift to like 20 ponys?
<otakon> OKAY! How about Panty Stocking and Garterbelt then?
<Shizuka> 13the story is very very good, but you have to get past the gore first
<Ghosties> 04How about Ikki Tousen? Huh?
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: Yeah, and I lucked out to be one of those lucky ponys.
<Shamroc> Shizuka: yep thats elfen lied for you.....only know that anime cause one of my freinds is a massive otaku
<otakon> c'mon! It's no crazier than any of the YTP that gets shown.
<Shizuka> 13true, and we've shown worse movies
<DeadpoolDash> ikki is pretty funny
<VioletGreySha> the gore is part of it and i like it awsoem show :3
<Shizuka> 13but shizu does have a sense of decorum :3
<otakon> Ghosties: but PSG is actually FUNNY where IT just tries too hard
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: And now I haz a cute floaty balloon unicorn friend who tells me to keel them all >:3
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Yeh. I only watched the first 4 episodes before I couldn't watch anymore. But not because of gore or fanservice. But because I could see it ending with a sad ending a mile away and I didn't want to see it.
<Shizuka> 13i do have limits of what i will put ponies through :3
<Ghosties> 04I KNOW
<Ghosties> 04Cromartie High
<otakon> so, PSG then?
<Shamroc> wait so Iron_Edge you got a boolincorn from a gift drop? and then you got one of you're own?
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: Do you really?? The scorch mark on my flank says otherwise.
<otakon> Ghosties: YES
<DeadpoolDash> queen's blade
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied has an amazing payoff at the end
<otakon> CROMARTIE HIGH!
<Ghosties> 04Zero gore and it's PG
<Shamroc> DeadpoolDash: oh GOD now
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: No just one from the gift drop.
<DeadpoolDash> manyuu hikenchou
<Ghosties> 04But it's like the funniest anime I've ever seen
<otakon> Ghosties: THAT IS A GODDAMN PLAN!
<Shizuka> 13i know what i need to pull from my archives and put people through after angel beats
<Shizuka> 13haibane renmei~
<otakon> Ghosties has GOT a GODDAMN PLAN
<Shizuka> 13moar sleepy for otakon
<otakon> XD
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: I bought a few wep from the shop just for the extra space and trading options.
<Shamroc> oh neat
<Ghosties> 04...HEY! Some anime! There's been hardly any movement! *pencil falls on floor* O-Oh..it's moving
*otakon is 50% awake now
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: So long as Elfen Lied doesn't have a depressing ending I may watch it on your reccomendation
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: I mean the balloonicorn is kool and all but not worth 18 bits. -lol
<Shamroc> so yeah i need 3 direct hits Iron_Edge if you could help me
<Shizuka> 13it's a little like inception where you're not sure if the story got closed or not
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Bittersweet more like.
<Shizuka> 13iirc the anime finished before the manga
<DeadpoolDash> gantz
<Iron_Edge> Shamroc: I gotcha. Whenever I get them I'll keep you updated.
<Ninjazz> ^
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: Aaah. Then thats the kind of anime I hate the most ^_^
<Shizuka> 13but at least it did end
<DeadpoolDash> black lagoon
<FairysHuff> Same happened with the StarOcean anime. That drove me nuts
<Shizuka> 13unlike other series that just.. won't... die...
<Shamroc> Shizuka: moop...that is all
<Bluestrom_S> Shizuka you're a bagpipe fan too?
<Ghosties> 04I can tell you why Cromartie High is the greatest anime ever: An entire episode is devoted to the students trying to remember a song from the radio
<Shizuka> 13this is Riverdance
<Shizuka> 13i love it
<Shizuka> 13it's the only album of its kind i have, but that's okay
<ponyloverforeva> Hey everypony!! :)
<Bluestrom_S> do you liky silly clover?
<KiwiBoi777> hey ponyloverforeva
<ponyloverforeva> swirly colours O_O
<Iron_Edge> ponyloverforeva: Sup bro /)
<Shizuka> 13Ghosties: isn't there a scene where the whole school has to answer whether milk is the main ingredient in yogurt?
<Shamroc> oh ello ponyloverforeva
<Ghosties> 04Yes
*Ponies47 Yawns
<Ghosties> 04It's in a contest to see who the biggest badass is
<Shizuka> 13dagobah.net had a few clip loops posted at one time
<ponyloverforeva> Iron_Edge: im fine bro /)
<Shamroc> Shizuka: i now want to watch.....now.......RIGHT FRAKIN NOW
<Shizuka> 13i love this song so much
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: Dont you have a bed to be lying in little filly >:3
<Ghosties> 04And every guy that's tough is too stupid to know otherwise save for the main character
<FairysHuff> Damn you Shizuka I need to have breakfast but I don't want to leave while good instrumental music is playing ^_^
<Ponies47> Wel lI'm gonna call it a night. I'm sleepy and plus the battery on the laptop is about to die so.....

<Phase4> 00,02whats broken
<Shizuka> 13while i am plugging...
<Shizuka> 13http://www.vortalcord.net/projects/
<Phase4> 00,02dat was me switching back to wireless, stupid broken cable

<Phase4> 00,02cole phelps: worst officer ever
<Phase4> 00,02drives backwards and doesnt afraid of anything
<Phase4> 00,02this is quite anoying
<Shizuka> 13phelps badge omgwtfbbq
<Phase4> 00,02i thought "might as well try a tf2 server, cant possibly be that hard
<Shamroc> Phase4: and still gets rewarded for failing 3 times in a row in an intergation
<Phase4> 00,02turns out it needs to download all the tf2 for that
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's mostly in the items i think
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, the second one was a bug
<ponyloverforeva> has the stream stopped or is it just me?
<Shizuka> 13it has to know what everything is
<Shizuka> 13plus maps are massive things
<Phase4> 00,02seems to be maps and sounds for me
<Phase4> 00,02yeah

<DeadpoolDash> all the things
<Phase4> 00,02maps are ~60%
<DeadpoolDash> and hats
<Shizuka> 13maps pretty much start at 50MB and go up from there i think
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, "its not a bug, its a feature"
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i'm seeing some smaller maps, but mostly yeah
<DeadpoolDash> the most advanced hat simulator ever created
<Phase4> 00,02the small ones are jump maps
<Shizuka> 13itemtest is the smallest
<Phase4> 00,02^ DeadpoolDash
<Shizuka> 13or should be
<Shamroc> Phase4: the "auto-failure Feature: the game can tell when you're about to fuck up....so we make it so you dont fuck up...but you still get punshied for the thing you didnt fuck up"
<Shizuka> 13of the stock maps... i would guess..... koth_nucleus is smallest?
<Shizuka> 13or maybe 2fort
<DeadpoolDash> its beginning to look alot like Dustbowl
<Shizuka> 13seeeentries everywhere~
<Shamroc> i dont know the lyrics to that
<Shamroc> ...darnit

<Ninjazz> Just one simple question, Cypresswolf|Pirate... do you have Rarity in that collection of yours?
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> and then some I think would be cool concepts - Berry Punch drinking bird, Vinyl Scratch Bobblehead

<Phase4> 00,02Rain, i dont think i can do thta
<Phase4> 00,02that'
<alexxm> i assume that wasn't supposed to happen
<Rain> you can land on minmus and make it back but you cant land on the water tower
<Phase4> 00,02i'll try though
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, ikr
<alexxm> Rain how is that possible
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, its easy to make it betwene planets
<Rain> I did it in one try, alexxm >_>
<Phase4> 00,02suprisingly little precision
<Rain> Phase4, my epic missing begs to differ
<Lil_B> Phase4 wow, a Kerbal Space Program Dektop Wallpaper?
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Summer is half over and I still havent finishing my bingo qouta for season 3 - brain no want pony overload
<Tovler> *yawn* I'm black from being asleep.
<Phase4> 00,02i aborted
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, yup
<alexxm> hey Tovler did you sleep well
<Tovler> >mfw there was a lottery and I missed it.
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, theres a video of me hitting mun
<Lil_B> Tovler did you sleep in the sun or why are you black now?
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah, i missed the lottery too
<Phase4> 00,02who won?
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> still 43/100 - even watching the episodes several times over again hasnt given me any new expectations
<alexxm> Cypresswolf|Pirate what was the quoata again
<alexxm> ah right 100
<Tovler> I woke all itchy and dry and dreamt of foreign coins for some reason.
<Rain> Phase4, I was in the understanding that nobody won because there was no newsletter for the lotto link to be given out >_>
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> may only be 50, only 7 more vs 57
<alexxm> Tovler odd any idea why
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, they just re-used last weeks
<ACS13123> Phase4: Chrysalis and someone else :/
<Rain> the same link and everything?
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, no, the entries
<Rain> oh..
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123,
<Phase4> 00,02derp
*Rain isnt sure if she put hers in last week but hopes she did
<Phase4> 00,02should be on the website but i didnt see it earlier today
<Rain> wait, what does it matter?
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ill have a better idea once the epsiode synopsis start coming out, but then that would be cheating :)
<Rain> not like I would have won anyway
<Tovler> the coin dream clearly come from my repressed regret of spending my gold-plated quarter.
<Glacymr> fake ones
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> I had another pony dream the other day, but forgot what it was about now
*Tovler writes a fanfic where Fluttershy becomes invisible and never finishes it.
<alexxm> i never get pony dreams
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> it was a good one this time, no nightmarish scenarios
<thegt90> what site is he on
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> I still remember that one O_o
<alexxm> what happened in the night mare one Cypresswolf|Pirate
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> alexxm: I just finished playing SCP 87, the stairway, and in the dream I was going down there, wrapping christmas lights around the rails until I ran out of cord, came back up and exited...
<Phase4> 00,02dat
<Phase4> 00,02is a big rocket
<APS> Phase4, can u tell me how to use colours on chat?
<APS> Phase4, from xchat
<alexxm> Cypresswolf|Pirate sounds bad
<Phase4> 00,02APS, right click or press ctrl+k and type the colour manually

<Rain> Phase4, want a tip? the j k l and i keys
<Ghost30k> mario_pony: What do ya Think?
<Tovler> oo. I did have this one nightmare where there was a looking really close at my arm hair and as I was scanning it the hair eventually form as dark creepy message.
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, its hard though
<Phase4> 00,02and my rockets are badly balanced
<Rain> seriously, just try pressing L when you have your rts going
<MusicalPony> sigh
<Ghost30k> cyber_pony13: your opinion?
<Rain> it scoots it sideways instead of making it turn
<mario_pony> Ghost30k: oh i havent read it yet it's too dark in here i'll probably read it during our road trip
<Ghost30k> ahhh ok lol
<Rain> unless you only have rts at the top that is
<Phase4> 00,02>australia
<Phase4> 00,02>part of asia
<Phase4> 00,02lolnope
<alexxm> Phase4 can you try to make a thunderbird
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, i could
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> alexxm: then ponies showed up among the D class personel and I sent Rarity down - dont tell Ninjazz >_> - she disapeared and I went back down the stairs to go look for her, a window appeared at the base of one stairwell that linked to the view of my front yard and my brother and his friends were watching me through it, I woke up no too much later when I started hearing Rarity's cries getting louder
<Phase4> 00,021 and 3 mabey
<alexxm> that sounds disturbing Cypresswolf|Pirate
<Phase4> 00,02i forget what 4 and up i

<Ghost30k> cyber_pony13: still writing the 4th and tell me if you think i should wait till Wednesday or Thursday to post it since I won't have much time this week
<Phase4> 00,02you're not given a lot to work with in kerbal
<Ghost30k> sorry bout the repeat <:3

<cyber_pony13> Ghost30k: when it comes to writing and posting put it out when you feel it's ready but not to the point to where you worry about it otherwise you'll have to time travel and go crazy like twi did

<Ghost30k> cyber_pony13: when it comes out

<Phase4> 00,02minmus has VERY little gravity
<Phase4> 00,02and minmus->mun transfer requires next to no fuel if you time it right

<d3rb> ^ good cheap fun
*Glacymr dumps a tub full of catnip on Espeon
<ACS13123> Ghosties, wtf?
<ACS13123> Ohh
<RaveBrony> d3rb: The actual 'games' i have are only POrtal 2 and TF2 :D
<ACS13123> derp
<Ghosties> 04I've poured over 300 hours into Terraria since I got it last Summer
<diddutz> dun dun dunnnn
<alexxm> RaveBrony how about moon base alpha
<RaveBrony> Ill look that up :P
<Ghosties> 04I've logged...346.9 hours, so right at 347 hours
<Starflash> o____o
<Starflash> That's... a lot
<d3rb> i've heard good things about limbo and amnesia
<Starflash> d3rb, both are awesome
<ACS13123> Dat car
<Ghosties> 04When I got Terraria, I played it for a month straight
<USS_Sulaco> Amnesia is amazing
<RaveBrony> What is it about, Ghosties?
<Ghosties> 04The entire month was literally "wake up, play Terraria, do BronyState stuff, go to bed." Rinse and repeat.
<Starflash> Ah, I remember days like that :D with different games tho
<Ghosties> 04Limbo is excellent too
<Ghosties> 04Incredibly atmospheric
<WallDives> and SPIDERS!
<Rain> but replay value = 0
<d3rb> ah i remember days like that before the horror of working
<Ghosties> 04Whereas Terraria has HIGH replay value
<Starflash> I don't know if I would play Limbo all day long, too.
<Ghosties> 04However, Limbo is fun to go back to after a while
<RaveBrony> Gas chamber o_o
<Starflash> I'm just digging up old Tales of games for ps2/gamecube <_< nostalgia missile
<d3rb> its a shame you missed the bundle with amnesia and limbo in it RaveBrony , it was a bargain (im still kicking myself over missing it)
<Rain> you would finish limbo before you could play it all day long
<Starflash> ^dat as well :D
<diddutz> Ghosties: LIMBO is the best Indie game i ever played :3
<RaveBrony> O.o
<RaveBrony> Dang, i wish Mircosoft Flight was cheaper...
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, it was a great indie bundle this time. Too bad I already own Limbo, Amnesia and Bastion
*RaveBrony sits and pouts
<Starflash> I only owned Bastion already, so I was really happy :D
<d3rb> flight simulator, i used to love those games
<WallDives> *bang*
<RaveBrony> ded
<diddutz> lika baws
<alexxm> so many dead people
<Sumica> 00,10here all this time I though you were watching a show by the sound of it
<RaveBrony> Roflmao!!! I JUST realized the music playing for "what i thought was the chase" was actually the Terraria trailer music! :D
<Starflash> Nay, L.A.
<d3rb> lol
*Rain power tackles Sumica and hugs him
<RaveBrony> Hiya Sumica :)

<AgentKalim> Pretty good, murica. Actually just woke up half an hour ago. And no, I DON'T have a normal sleeping schedule. I went to sleep at roughly five in the morning, woke up at 13:30.
<omegasparkle> noir
<Starflash> Hmm, That sounds normal enough though AgentKalim
<AgentKalim> Wut :P

<Starflash> Phase4... one does not simply drive up the stairs
<AgentKalim> That's not how a car works
<alexxm> physics don't work that way
<ACS13123> smooth Phase4, real smooth :p
<Phase4> 00,02Starflash, XD
<Starflash> ah... apparently one does

<AgentKalim> Stay off the Moonshine, putz!
<LegoBrony> twilight_sprinkle They probably don't know what it means there so dumb
<RaveBrony> Im always VERY careful about telling this site to others :D
<Alchemist> nowdays its super easy to troll people, you dont need to be subtle or have think. Just go on youtube and comment on any videogame related video something like this: dis gaem sux, its for kiddies. all the cool peeps are playing cod . you need tactics 2 play cod." and then sit back and enjoy the sh*tstorm...
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, D:
<twilight_sprinkle> LegoBrony: lol well that was fun anywauy
<Chrysalis> huh, "Sunny as Buck"
<Chrysalis> but BUCKS not happened yety
<Phase4> 00,02i might switch to tf2 for a bit
<Chrysalis> so how do you know?
<RaveBrony> Alchemist: Yeah, people are butthurt WAY too easy :D
<LegoBrony> twilight_sprinkle Yeah, It was.
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: Yeah but the attempts they made to troll was so laughable rather then actually troll ish
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: i started an epic shitstorm that lasted for weeks on a utube vid when i said the earth is flat :D
<Vacation_Wrek> OH U
<d3rb> twilight_sprinkle, :D
<AgentKalim> Wait, seriously?
<Chrysalis> :P
<Chrysalis> had to do it
<AgentKalim> I'm so glad my dad trained me in anti-trolling. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> AgentKalim: me seriously? yeah :D
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: true, their "attempt" was subpar even for today's expectations.
<d3rb> trained in anti trolling?
<omegasparkle> take a look at that 36 polygon ass!!
<Chrysalis> omegasparkle you mean dat plot
<LegoBrony> I apologize for letting parasprites in.
<Tovler> I need to find Donna Tung and ask her about anti-trolling.
<Chrysalis> this game has serious plot
<Vacation_Wrek> but yah Chrysalis: tryign to enjoy as much of the sunny weather as possible before buck
<omegasparkle> take a look at my plot device
<Vacation_Wrek> ive hard there will be rain
<Vacation_Wrek> heard*
<twilight_sprinkle> thats one detailed drawing of underwear
<RaveBrony> :o
<AgentKalim> Stay calm, don't get butthurt and either deconstruct them or just walk away.
<RaveBrony> ^
<Chrysalis> Vacation_Wrek its really not that bad here, anyway theres no forecast taht far ahead
<Chrysalis> hell, outside right now is lovely, no clouds at all
<Alchemist> AgentKalim: I prefer walking away. Why waste any time?
<Tovler> To take down troll over the internet takes actual skill.
<Phase4> 00,02tf2 or build bigger rocket
*Rain hugs Vacation_Wrek "you heard there would be what now?" :3c
<omegasparkle> that girl looks like a man
<Phase4> 00,02i needs bigger rocket for longer trip in ksp
<Chrysalis> Phase4 tf2? then we can join
<omegasparkle> build bigger rocket
<AttackWithHugs> omegasparkle: I think all the females in this game do.
<Vacation_Wrek> meant the general assumption that the UK islands=24/7 rain
<AgentKalim> That girl looks like a girl, actually. :P
<RaveBrony> Learn to accept other people thoughts, and you can let just about anything roll off your back :D
<AttackWithHugs> Well guys, I'm going to church now.
<Phase4> 00,02later AttackWithHugs

<Alchemist> Chrysalis: that sounded nasty...on many levels....
<d3rb> finished talking to witness
<Rain> Phase4, you might want to restart your stream >_>
<Chrysalis> i know
<Phase4> 00,02i had a whole 10 minutes of failure after this
<Phase4> 00,02i meen
<WallDives> JAESUS.
<Chrysalis> stream lag
<Phase4> 00,0210 minutes of epic
<AgentKalim> I mean
<Phase4> 00,02the next 10 minutes went perfectly
<d3rb> :D
<Chrysalis> you just typed wow
<Rain> Phase4, seriously, you need to restart your stream, bro
<AgentKalim> 10 minutes of epic failure

<Phase4> 00,02<_<
<AgentKalim> <.<
<AgentKalim> <.>
<diddutz> Phase4: we're at 12 minutes at delay now, climbing ^^
<Phase4> 00,02dat should be better now
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Chrysalis> MUCH better now

<omegasparkle> still 3 seconds behind >.>
<Phase4> 00,02i needs big
<Phase4> 00,023 seconds is briliant
<Chrysalis> omegasparkle thats about normal
<Lil_B> I never notcied that theyx have so small bodies :/
<diddutz> Phase4: but now your 10 minutes of failure/epic will be lost FOREVER T.T
<AgentKalim> 3 seconds behind is an acceptable delay.
<Phase4> 00,02infact its probably some kind of record
<Phase4> 00,02nominal delay is at least 20
<Chrysalis> diddutz just imagin the best epic possible
<Ulthane> more like 12-20 seconds
<Phase4> 00,0210 if your lucky
<Chrysalis> and pretend you watched phase do 10mins of it
<omegasparkle> so much buffer
<Phase4> 00,02^ Chrysalis
<Phase4> 00,02so yeah
<Phase4> 00,02shuttle or command module?

<AgentKalim> Needs more thrusters
<Phase4> 00,02whats suposed to happen is the outer tanks on the shuttle part should be drained first
<Phase4> 00,02instead the inner tank is being drained for the inner rocket
<valoreins> yay my friend is in bronycon and he's going to find some souvenirs there for me :D
<Phase4> 00,02fuel lines are doing nothing

<PinkiePieCopy> MusicalPony: Because, it was hot.

<Lil_B> Damnit!
<valoreins> brace yourself, the fanmade version of the silly smile song will be made
<omegasparkle> for a brony site there is supprisingly small amounts of ponies
<Phase4> 00,02ALLMOST enough for orbit
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, havent noticed the issues
<Phase4> 00,02with the sas that is
<Phase4> 00,02and trying to use all stock parts
<valoreins> currently the viewers of bronycon livestream is 1541
<Phase4> 00,02no fun in mods, they make it too easy
<omegasparkle> the stream literally just rewinded like 3 seconds
<valoreins> and the song referred derpy doo?!

<|Discord|> So...hows everypony doing>
<Lil_B> valoreins zes, derpz Oo
<Tovler> I find the word Derpy awesome.
<omegasparkle> chaotic
<valoreins> let's see the brony artist made the song in YT
<omegasparkle> thanks for asking Discord
<Ghosties> 04<omegasparkle> for a brony site there is supprisingly small amounts of ponies <-- You mean BronyState or the BronyCon stream?
<Lil_B> My Keyboard layout eppearently just changed ...
<alexxm> i'm good |Discord| how about you
<omegasparkle> bronystate
<|Discord|> alexxm: Good good...im back at home
<Starflash> And then, people were expecting 24/7 ponies on stream again.
<Ghosties> 04Ah, in that case:
<omegasparkle> i haven't looked at bronycon bcause of some reasons >.>
<Chrysalis> omegasparkle http://www.bronystate.net/faq/
<alexxm> spinning only annoys the astronauts
<valoreins> the silly smile song has a 60s feel..
<Dalekkahn> Don't ask for ponys omega, or we will get the live ponies *shudder*
<Starflash> Smiiiiile
<Ghosties> 04BronyState emphasizes a heavy policy on the Brony aspect of the community, instead of strictly ponies. What this means is that this site is primarily dedicated to the fan, so outlets like movies, games, discussions, art, etc. is focused on you guys: the Bronies. While we are known to be the number 1 streaming service for FiM episodes, we offer much more than just ponies.
<valoreins> yup
<Chrysalis> or ^
<omegasparkle> i seem to be making you type alot
<Vacation_Wrek> ghosties loves typing
<Chrysalis> youd think it was a chatroom
<omegasparkle> :D
<Ghosties> 04Oh, I didn't type that. I simply copypasted
<omegasparkle> i see wat you did there
<Starflash> I thought so =w=
<Ghosties> 04It's on the website
<valoreins> you think this is a real chatroom, NOPE, Chuck Testa
<omegasparkle> no, i mean i'm making you explain things alot, because i don't usually read rules and what not
<Starflash> So is this an imaginary chatroom?
<AskDerpyDoo> OMG guys, I just became a brony musician!
<AskDerpyDoo> I just released my first song
<Ghosties> 04Then you should, I dunno, READ THE RULES
<NullRadix> Starflash: no, its a real chatroom in an imaginary existance
<ACS13123> weeeeeeeee
<Skylands> 10Soi!
<Starflash> weeeeeeeeee
<Starflash> Also, never say you haven't read the rules.
<AskDerpyDoo> its mostly just lyrics right now though
<FairysHuff> I'm tempted to go buy chips with heart stopping levels of salt and vinegar for dinner. Must.... resist O_o
<Skylands> 10You don't need to be on the lookout for a Shadow Lugia plush on eBay anymore, I found one on Amazon and I am waiting for it to be delivered
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not using the shuttle bits cause its a shuttle
<Ghosties> 04>salt and vinegar
<Chimera> hiiiiiiiiiiiii :3
<Ghosties> 04You disgust me
<Phase4> 00,02i'm using them cause large light tanks
<Starflash> That sounds.... not quite edible
<Skylands> 10hi Chimew
<Phase4> 00,02i like salt and vinegar chips
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Why?
<Chimera> x3
<Tovler> Great, now I want a huge bag o' chips
*Skylands snug
<valoreins> and i have coffee
<Ghosties> 04Hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE salt and vinegar flavored chips
<NullRadix> FairysHuff: go drink a gallon of water, then reevaluate
<alexxm> stop making me hungry
*Chimera purrs and returns snug
<Phase4> 00,02oh cool
<Phase4> 00,02it floats
<AskDerpyDoo> hey guys ! I am a new brony musician!
<Phase4> 00,02now i just need a boat engine
<Phase4> 00,02ohai AskDerpyDoo
<AskDerpyDoo> anypony want to listen>?
<Sumica> 00,10every thing flotes
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: No no. Not american chips. Uk chips as in fried hot potatos. Like fries
<omegasparkle> yesh
<AskDerpyDoo> It's just lyrics right now though.
<Ghosties> 04Hey Derpy, please stop advertising unless you can get permission
<turtlegod98> Success!
<Sumica> 00,10there is no underwater to realy caculate
<Tovler> great. Now my favorite flavor is Salt and Vinegar. I'm such a spiteful person
<valoreins> AskDerpyDoo: maybe after i finished watching bronycon :p
<Derpy_Hooves> Ghosties: wha?
<alexxm> it didn't explode
<Sumica> 00,10........why wheels if no wings?
<Ghosties> 04Not you, Derpy. I was talking to AskDerpyDoo
<Derpy_Hooves> oh ok
<Kandarihu> Water, the only frontier still unknown to the Kerbals.
<AskDerpyDoo> advertising is posting links.
<AskDerpyDoo> I'm just so excited that I made my FIRST song.
<AskDerpyDoo> and said that I made it
<Phase4> 00,02i feel dis needs more rockets
<Ghosties> 04Advertising is also going "Hey! Check out my stuff!"
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, insane plan
<killerpony7733> AskDerpyDoo: If you are new to this site best check the FAQ and rules
<Sumica> 00,10yeah some of the shuttle parts has like an impact tollerence of 255, so you can get them to bounce in to orbit if you hit the ocean.
<AskDerpyDoo> I did not say that
<Phase4> 00,02wanted to try land on wheels on the mun
<Starflash> "Never argue with mods"
<AskDerpyDoo> I wasn't advertising
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, the mod ones i think, stock ones explode like normal
<Starflash> neverrrr
<Chrysalis> even though water is like concrete at those speeds
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<Ghosties> 04You've twice told people to check out your things
<Ghosties> 04Stop
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, theres a problem with the nosecone, if you hit it just right it'll fling you into orbit or through the ground
<Sumica> 00,10it's also realy bad with the SRB's
<Ghosties> 04Either you get permission from a mod to advertise your work or you advertise in PM.
<Lil_B> Ghosties is "I made something, does someone wants to see&hear it?" ok?
<Sumica> 00,10I have crashed a seond flight in to the still flying SRB's of the first flight
<Ghosties> 04You have to get permission first
<Phase4> 00,02lets add more rocket
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<the_real_pony_1604> fire at bronycon
<Tovler> are those sparks?
<the_real_pony_1604> live on stream
<Saturn> 08,01Gunny: i've never used it
<Saturn> 08,01but i do happen to be a linux wizard
<Phase4> 00,02dese lucky transfers are making me look like a much better pilot than i am
<Saturn> 08,01so ask away
*Saturn 08,01licks Elephant
<Dalekkahn> Phase is best space pilot
<Gunny> Saturn, what is that program called that you used on the stream before? It was like a Linux client.
<Phase4> 00,02it looks kinda prety
<Phase4> 00,02when transfering orbit
<Lil_B> The Plastic on one of the lights ast Bronzcon began to burn >&
*Mutterguy sees Kerbantartica
<Phase4> 00,02seeing the other planet aproach
<NullRadix> please remain calm. the building is on fire
*Tovler waits for them to turn off the lights
<twilight_sprinkle> Lol that panel is on FIRE...
<Phase4> 00,02no stress on anything
<Phase4> 00,02just a gentle drift
<Chrysalis> bronycon is on fire!
<Tovler> Do not panic, you will all die. ~REGIS MkV
<Phase4> 00,02i could slingshot around mun and go for minmus
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh my gosh
<the_real_pony_1604> LOL, being someone that works with high power lighting this is funny
<valoreins2> lamp caught fire :o
<AskDerpyDoo> Bronycon is on fire
<Chrysalis> holy cow, the light is actually melting
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://twitpic.com/a2pj8r
<AskDerpyDoo> what kind of brony pushes and shoves other people?
<Lil_B> Chrysalis why is the stream camera focusing on the fire Oo
<AskDerpyDoo> that's just wrong
<Chrysalis> why is that light still on
<the_real_pony_1604> a latter
<Chrysalis> wait, a ladder
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> oshit
<Lil_B> a Stepladder_
<Tovler> ladder, but not a light switch
<twilight_sprinkle> wow that lamp is burning good
<Mutterguy> the_real_pony_1604 sorry just assumed you were a troll
<Chrysalis> man, that is an AMAZING announcer
<AskDerpyDoo> I blame Spitfire
<CrimsonPhoenix> We know what they should callÉ
<valoreins> hope nothing goes wrong
<CrimsonPhoenix> ?**
<Tovler> It like something out of austin powers
<Phase4> 00,02theres actualy not much point to slingshotting around other planets
<CrimsonPhoenix> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<GilDash> It sparked plasma a minute or five ago. :D
<Mutterguy> GHOSTBUSTERS!
<Lil_B> valoreins the fire is just an optical illusion
<Mutterguy> aww\
<Tovler> yep… it's quite on fire
<the_real_pony_1604> nope, was watching the panel and then saw it start to drip in front of the camera
<Phase4> 00,02the difference betwene a mun transfer and minmus transfer from kerbin is bugger all
<Chrysalis> why is that light still on ffs
<valoreins> :s
<AskDerpyDoo> lol call upon the seaponies when you're in distress
<Phase4> 00,02might as well just go direct
<Spitfire> AskDerpyDoo: Wha?
<AskDerpyDoo> does this count?
<GilDash> TURN THE SODDING LIGHTS OFF! :D
<Chrysalis> wrong lights
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> WHY THE FUCK HAVENT THEY cut the power yet
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> soo dangress
<AskDerpyDoo> please don't turn the camera off
<valoreins> is the floor alright?
<the_real_pony_1604> it is right above the seating area of the main stage
<Tovler> they almost turned off the light. "Isn't 'almost' good enought?"
<Chrysalis> valoreins its being covered in molten plastic
<Mutterguy> [wklmjhe]JRP2234 powerboard is probably on a swtch board in a basement
<valoreins> wow
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> the cut it
<Lil_B> well, at least the lights are out now
<Tovler> It's like a lava lamp
<valoreins> I blame Pyro for this incident
<GilDash> Tovler: Literally. :D
<Phase4> 00,02spaceflight is beautiful
<AgentKalim> So I decide to watch the Everfree radio stream live on the big TV, I set it all up, takes me quite a while, and what do I see when I set up? A broken light. Innit grand? :P
<Mutterguy> Soooo BroNYcon is probably cancelled
<Saturn> 08,01so this just happened: http://imgur.com/Jjr8V
<Chrysalis> someones taking photos
<Chrysalis> wtf
<Phase4> 00,02dem jpeg artifacts
<AskDerpyDoo> who thought it was a good idea to put plastic next to a very hot heat source?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure who they are
<AgentKalim> 1900 people are watching a broken light right now, including me. :P
<MusicalPony> im so excited..
<Chrysalis> AgentKalim and me
<AskDerpyDoo> LANDING ON THE MOON
<Lil_B> Chrysalis at least all the plastic is burnt soon
<Chrysalis> Lil_B sooon
<Chrysalis> .jpg
<Phase4> 00,02o
<AgentKalim> What happened to that goddamn light anyway? I JUST came in to see that.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try actualy land this time
<AskDerpyDoo> you need rockets for that
<the_real_pony_1604> it looks like it is a normal diffuser that all the lights have. that one just had a problem
<valoreins> overheat
<Phase4> 00,02none of this low orbit crap
<Chrysalis> AgentKalim i think the light just popped
<AskDerpyDoo> parachutes won't work
<Saturn> 08,01AskDerpyDoo: red that in Bob Marley's voice
<Tovler> Thanks to that light, Christmas is cancelled.
<Phase4> 00,02AskDerpyDoo, i have 3
<Chrysalis> and the casing caught fire
<AgentKalim> I see
<AskDerpyDoo> there's no air on the moon
<Chrysalis> there goes the bulb
<valoreins> someone took a photo of it... :s
<GilDash> Are they just letting it burn out? :D
<AskDerpyDoo> is this the FREE version>?
<AgentKalim> I guess so
<Lil_B> Chrysalis because when something is burning, just wait untill everything is reduced into ashes... best way to handle with the situation... like a bruning building
<Mutterguy> yeah but gravity is ebil
<GilDash> Ohh... there's the bulb.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that would have been a perfect finale
<Mutterguy> EBIL I SAY
<GilDash> Lil_B: Unless it spreads. :S
<NullRadix> assuming there's nothing else to catch on fire nearby, letting it burn out isn't a bad solution
<Chrysalis> Lil_B how could you put a fir out that high
<Chrysalis> besides
<Chrysalis> metal roof
<NullRadix> considering the alternative is drenching half the area in water
<valoreins> yup
<AgentKalim> But where are the firefighters in all that? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> well even if they shot it down it's too late
<AskDerpyDoo> did you land?
<Mutterguy> getting there
<NullRadix> nice ladders
<CrimsonPhoenix> the fire is there and it will burn the remaining
<Tovler> Spider-man could burn some marshmallows on that.
<Chrysalis> theres just a pool of burning molten plastic
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try de-orbit carefully
<Chrysalis> lost signal?
<CrimsonPhoenix> LOST SIGNAL
<AgentKalim> Are you telling me there's no security and/or safety in all of BroNYcon?
<GilDash> Depends on what's inside the bulding too. A building full of explosive material probably shouldn't be left to "burn out."
<Tovler> We get signal
<Lil_B> silly Gildash, Fire cant spread!
<Tovler> its you
<the_real_pony_1604> yeah, those ladders are not going to make it… and the camera was shut off
<Chrysalis> the light was above the stage :O
<AgentKalim> UNIT LOST
<alexxm> we got movie sign
<GilDash> AgentKalim: Did you not see that guy standing in blue the whole time?
<valoreins> lost signal
<Tovler> I guess we can do the booty dance until the con is back on.
<AgentKalim> GilDash: I guess I did? :P
<Lil_B> we got a sign of LOST... never watched that show
<AgentKalim> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> That was a glorious fire.
<Skydroid> Power went out, cry
<GilDash> AgentKalim: I think *that* was their idea of security. :D
<AgentKalim> Twas a great pyre
<GilDash> Well, Spitfire showed up I guess. :D
<valoreins> i blame Pyro
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> http://vocaroo.com/i/s0m1YewucsMI my reaction to lost signal
<Lil_B> the fire was planned and a reference to the pyro update
<AgentKalim> prince-lemon: Wow that was quick
<twilight_sprinkle> lol datEQD post
<Tovler> The announcer was funny. Him describing the fire was similar to how Will Ferrell's character was describing his pain in Austin Powers
<AgentKalim> That fire. It was so fiery and hot.
<AskDerpyDoo> what all that extra stuff in orbit?
<AgentKalim> Space junk
<Phase4> 00,02the rcs isnt realy neded on this craft
<Chrysalis> Tovler that announcer was incredible with how CALM he was
<Phase4> 00,02its there to help with takeoff and landing should i need a sudden burst
<AgentKalim> I guess Imma watch the Lauren Faust panel from yesterday until it comes back on
<AskDerpyDoo> LIVING IT UP ON THE DARK SIDE
<AskDerpyDoo> OF THE MOON
<Phase4> 00,02under power though it doesnt matter
<Tovler> The announcer was annoyed at how noone was turning off the lights.
<Phase4> 00,02rockets have vectoring
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> [01:03:51] Vigilant_Watch sets mode +m[01:04:01] <%Sketchy_Sounds> And that's why the chat was muted.[01:04:05] <%Vigilant_Watch> Yes. there was a fire. Congratulations.
<valoreins> i'll just wait for the signal to come back
<Lil_B> Chrysalis he was more like... fire... seriously?
<Tovler> He was almost John Malkoviching
<GilDash> he must have some British in him. :D
<Phase4> 00,02theres gyro's in the command module
<Phase4> 00,02makes things nice and easy
<Mutterguy> I think I was an early contributer to the flood
<the_real_pony_1604> I think that was the voice guy for Big Mac, but not 100% sure
<Chrysalis> Discord happened to the lgiht
<AskDerpyDoo> how do you plan on getting OFF of the moon?
<Chrysalis> anthology late
<kidzrul434> It's gonna happen today bronies! I can feel it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh godd guys guys listen
<Lil_B> the_real_pony_1604 yes, the guy in the hat was big mac
<AskDerpyDoo> inb4 crash and burn
<the_real_pony_1604> he was part of the panel
<Tovler> they may as well upload Anthology 2 now
<AgentKalim> AskDerpyDoo: Get off the Moon? What do you MEAN get OFF the moon? :P
<kidzrul434> I'm gonna get lego batman 2 today I can feel it!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I guess that fire shall be the highlight of the entire con.
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> hmm in december 21th 2012 the world will change.... IT AL MAKES SENSE NOW
<appledash6> good morning;)
<GilDash> John de Lancie, please contain your powers. :D
<AgentKalim> ^
<Lil_B> GilDash XD, or use them to stop this
<AskDerpyDoo> well, you have to rescue Luna and brng her back to Equestria
<Mutterguy> GilDash if he was seeming drinking a glass of chocolate milk, it would explain a lot
<AskDerpyDoo> Dec. 12 2012, it is announced that MLP season 4 is canceled
<AskDerpyDoo> are you on the moon yet?
<ACS13123> AskDerpyDoo: that would be horrible, specially since my birthday is the day after that...
<Lil_B> has anzone seen Vordox latly?
<Tovler> I'm nervous about Season 3 now that Lauren and Rob Renzetti are completely removed.
<GilDash> Tovler: Who's Rob? :S
<GilDash> Haven't heard that name before.
<Chrysalis> pixelkitties @pixelkitties
<Chrysalis> The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire...
<Chrysalis> "
<AskDerpyDoo> don't worry in heaven they have all 50 seasons and new episodes continue to be produced
<twilight_sprinkle> HELLFIRE~
<Lil_B> damnit, my keyboard layout somehow got switchet, z and y are now switched and all the symbols are gone_
<Starflash> Dat burnycon... so bad -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, that surely was the highlight of the con
<Tovler> I think Rob was the head story editor or something like that.
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<Phase4> 00,02was hoping to keep that engine
<Lil_B> Tovler yes, nmain guy for the storys
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, are you on the moon?
<Dalekkahn> In 4 minutes I'm gonna see something that leads to a lost engine
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah. thelamp couldnt handle the heat
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02and i'm on a hill
<Phase4> 00,02with wheels
<CrimsonPhoenix> say hi to woona for me :3
<appledash6> i hope in season 3 derpy has derpy eyes
<Phase4> 00,02so it wont stop rolling
<Phase4> 00,02REALY need some kind of vertical controll
<appledash6> :O
<AskDerpyDoo> I hope he has a contest, like a "Hey bronies! Submit your idea for an episode" contest
<Phase4> 00,02rcs MIGHT be enough but no clue how to controll it
<CrimsonPhoenix> appledash6, Derpy always had derpy eyes afteer the last round-up
<AskDerpyDoo> A and D buttons?
<Chrysalis> tara strong @tarastrong
<Chrysalis> Fire @BronyCon!!! (I blame my dress) come me outside the hotel to the right 4 autographs
<Dalekkahn> The music for your landing was pretty good
<Phase4> 00,02but i am on the ground
<AskDerpyDoo> Daring Doo is Derpy Doo's mom
<MusicalPony> back everpony!
<Phase4> 00,02nw
<Phase4> 00,02now'
<Phase4> 00,02wheeled takeof
<Lil_B> AskDerpyDoo well, thez would get enough good quality content to last 5 seasons XD
<Phase4> 00,02no clue if this will work
<AskDerpyDoo> don't worry in heaven they have all 50 seasons and new episodes continue to be produced
<MusicalPony> i smell like a man now :| my dad sprayed me with axe
<appledash6> bigfoot
<AskDerpyDoo> and you can actually become one of the characters!
<appledash6> fire
<Lil_B> MusicalPony how does it feel to ba a man ?
<MusicalPony> Lil_B: gross.
<AskDerpyDoo> (actually heaven is 120% cooler than the best thing you can think of)
<Mutterguy> It's Christmas in heaven every single day!
<Lil_B> MusicalPony aww :(
<AskDerpyDoo> It's better than Christmas
<Dalekkahn> MusicalPony: you should be careful. I hear in commercials that women flock to people sprayed with axe
<Tovler> Hopefully, Blast Hardcheese will be the new story editor.
<AskDerpyDoo> I heard there's a library with every book ever written
<pony_907376> ?
<MusicalPony> Lil_B: lol sorry, i just smell like a man and im not around my bf,.. its too awkward.
<Tovler> He's someone I can put my faith in
<AskDerpyDoo> and every book never written
<Mutterguy> ^monty python reference
<Phase4> 00,02wekk
<Phase4> 00,02well'
<Phase4> 00,02i lost bits
<AskDerpyDoo> its the best library ever, because its even better than I describe it
<Phase4> 00,02but all in all i call this a success
<AskDerpyDoo> and CRASH
<Phase4> 00,02i'm limited by the parts avaliabel to me
<AgentKalim> This was a triumph
<AgentKalim> Im making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS
<Chrysalis> i'm mkaing a note here
<Dalekkahn> We just got to your landing
<Chrysalis> huge success
<AgentKalim> Chrysalis: Ninja'd
<Mutterguy> we just saw it Phase4, good tineing!
<AskDerpyDoo> HUGE... BOOM! success?
<Phase4> 00,02SHIT
<Lil_B> AgentKalim now I onlz want zou gone
<Phase4> 00,02i ran out of fuel
<Saturn> 08,01so that lass who did that chrysalis picture, i put a load of her postcards and one of her t-shirts on our BUCK stand
<twilight_sprinkle> screwd
<Phase4> 00,02ur
<AskDerpyDoo> and you continue to slide across the lunar landscape
<Phase4> 00,02uh'
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Dalekkahn> GG
<Phase4> 00,02i was kinda relying on NOT loosing that rocket
<Chrysalis> Saturn what design is on the t-shirt?
<AskDerpyDoo> fire your rockets!
<Saturn> 08,01and she just came up to our stand and said "since you put those up, i suddenly got loads of customers!"
<Saturn> 08,01she's almost run out
<AskDerpyDoo> see if you can get off the moon
<MusicalPony> my head hurts
<Chrysalis> lol, awesome
<Dalekkahn> Phase4 you also can't use the central tank correct?
<Chrysalis> go Saturn!
*MusicalPony head throbs
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: it's a human fluttershy
<Tovler> Why do I hear a train whistle way out here?
<Phase4> 00,02i have a full tank that i cant use due to the fule lines being missing
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, yeah
<Tovler> *gasp* The Polar Express
<Lil_B> Saturn can zou give us a link_
<Phase4> 00,02i have the rcs
<Phase4> 00,02thats not much though
<Phase4> 00,02could of sworn i had more fuel
<MusicalPony> i have to leave soon... its so depressing i wont see any of you again :(
<AskDerpyDoo> I was driving on the moon one day...
<Dalekkahn> Looks like it will have to be a munar rover after all
<AskDerpyDoo> in the merry merry month of .... July?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<AgentKalim> That's what I call... Lunar Slander :P
<Lil_B> damnit, I just looked into the mirror and I look totallz 90|s with mz cap and colorfull Tshirt XD
<Phase4> 00,02i needs more rockets on this thing
<AskDerpyDoo> Add wings to it
<AskDerpyDoo> your DOINGIT
<AskDerpyDoo> OMG!
<NullRadix> Wait... the Kerbals have names now?
<AskDerpyDoo> and CRASH
<MusicalPony> Phase4: are you just orbitting the moon?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Saturn:
<AgentKalim> Gerbils always have names.
<AgentKalim> You just didn't know them before :P
<AskDerpyDoo> fire!
<Phase4> 00,02MusicalPony, nope
<Phase4> 00,02i'm about to crash
<MusicalPony> aw.
<Mutterguy> Phase4 it's ok. Mission control would have them out there plugging everything back together and then finding the lunar dust ruins all the seals because it's so abrasive and the ship explodes.
<Saturn> 08,01hehehe
<Phase4> 00,02you'll see that in a minute
<AskDerpyDoo> You can do it!
<MusicalPony> well that sucks Phase4
<Saturn> 08,01that lass is nice
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Saturn: why do i see your name
<Phase4> 00,02my design needs work
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, lemme link you to her DA, if Phase4 doesn't mind
<Phase4> 00,02sure
<AskDerpyDoo> is this part of the free version phase?
<Mutterguy> nope
<AskDerpyDoo> hey phase I just made a new song, and joined the brony community, can I post link to it?
<Phase4> 00,02i could add more fuel and dump it
<Phase4> 00,02AskDerpyDoo, nope, this is .15.2
<MusicalPony> u didnt crash yet
<valoreins> Bronycon Stream, WE GET SIGNAL
<Phase4> 00,02AskDerpyDoo, i'd say yes
<AskDerpyDoo> really?
<AgentKalim> valoreins: WHAT YOU SAY
<Saturn> 08,01http://shiory.deviantart.com/
<AskDerpyDoo> yay!
<AgentKalim> MAIN SCREEN TURN ON
<Dalekkahn> Phase4 I think that as long as you keep the central rocket safe on landing your ship would have been fine
<appledash6> ask
<AskDerpyDoo> http://theseaponiesofliverpool.tumblr.com/post/26275785374/1st-song-lyrics-strawberry-sea-forever-would its just lyrics right now....
<valoreins> how are you gentlemen
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, yeah, that was the plan
<AskDerpyDoo> its a seapony version of Strawberry Fields Forever
<Phase4> 00,02there is mroe than enough to do a kerbin re-entry in the center
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Dalekkahn> Phase4 maybe add two way fuel lines on the central tank that is closer to the cocpit just in case
<MusicalPony> OMG HAHAHA
<valoreins> ohai Everlasting_Joy you wouldnt believe what we see at bronycon
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, was thinking that
<Everlasting_Joy> valoreins: I can imagine. . . What did you see?
<Phase4> 00,02but the problem is the tanks
<Phase4> 00,02little too heavy

<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: 3 years without internet? you sure? sounds surreal
<Phase4> 00,02dhis should explode
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: my parents are kinda strict.
<Phase4> 00,02no reason this should not explode
<ACS13123> FairysHuff: if you dont know it, dont worry, only poeple who get it get it
<FairysHuff> ACS13123: *Shrugs*
<MusicalPony> they said 8 months before i could even get my phone back.
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: they cant monitor you all the time. make some friends, use thei inet
<GilDash> MusicalPony: Why are your parents so strict? How are you on the internet now?
<Phase4> 00,02too late for srs flight
<Phase4> 00,02so explosive test then bed
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: im afraid to get caught
<alexxm> inb4 it explodes
<Lil_B> I had a little internet problem, did something happen since the fire at the con_
<MusicalPony> GilDash: im at my dads and he doesnt care, so im allowed. but secretly. my mom and her boyfriend are the strict ones.
<Cobellanez> TO THE MUUUUUUUN
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: its already 3 years without internet, cant be much worse. by the point thats over you should be old enough to have a reasonable amount of freedom
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy, an argument going about FiMFiction's action
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: yeah i guess. tell that to them. i havent had internet since.. well, about 2 years now.
<CrimsonPhoenix> more precisely Poultron
<GilDash> MusicalPony: Ask them why. :(
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: id tell it to them gladly.
<MusicalPony> GilDash: i already know.
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: haha well that would be wonderful
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: dont you go to school or something?
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: yeah i do. why?
<GilDash> MusicalPony: How come?
<MusicalPony> GilDash: i got in trouble :|
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: well dont you need internet for assignments?
<MusicalPony> GilDash: i get WHY i just think its a bit harsh
<Phase4> 00,02Excelent
<Phase4> 00,02fuel drains correctly
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: well yea, i can use internet then, but im monitored by them every second.
<GilDash> MusicalPony: Trouble for what? What the hell did you do to get banned for 3 years? :O
<Phase4> 00,02and everything detatches in the right order
<MusicalPony> GilDash: ehh id rather not speak of it. its stupid and just embarassing.
<Lil_B> did the Writing is Magic Panel continou after the fire?
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: was it an accident
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, it was at the very end
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: no
<killerpony7733> twilight_sprinkle: It's rather obvious it may be something embarrasing so best not to ask silly filly
<valoreins> dunno but its definitely not streamed... and maybe we will miss the ponies: anthology II
<Lil_B> ok
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: kinda i guess. i just got in trouble for stuff i did
<Cobellanez> Stuff? So it was a collection of things?
<Dken2021> If anthology is skipped, at least there's youtube
<FairysHuff> She doesn't want to talk about it. Leave MusicalPony with her privacy.
<valoreins> Fire is out, BronyCon will continue soon
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: hmm well if you learned your lesson you should tell them that
<Kencolt> And where there's Youtube, there's Bronystate. Hiya, ponies.
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> ima making dubstep
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: i guess i should.. that would definitely help/
<MusicalPony> FairysHuff: ty
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: i guess you could wait a bit, behave nicely, make sure you yourself have learned the lesson, and then apologize and tell them
<Dken2021> I think we found who did it http://i.imgur.com/CG8M6.png
<pony_6931> I just realized that this is a remix Twilight's theme
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: Anytime
<Everlasting_Joy> A'ight, I didn't plan on being here long, and I'm going to take off.
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: good plan
<twilight_sprinkle> MusicalPony: yeah well good luck with that, maybe it wont be 3 years after all
<alexxm> hey Kencolt hows your day been
<MusicalPony> twilight_sprinkle: maybe not. it probably will help even the slightest bit
<killerpony7733> Dken2021: Oh derpy
<Dken2021> ohai Kencolt
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually no
<Kencolt> Not bd at al, alexxm . Just woke from a decent nap-- first good sleep in days.

<RaveBrony> Is it in the corner for anyone else?
<Phase4> 00,02unless.

<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, maby thats why theres soo much of it
<CrimsonPhoenix> [wklmjhe]JRP2234, but painfull to hear
<valoreins> what a terrible day to have a con
<appledash6> pokemon
<Lil_B> all the animals are now dead
<CrimsonPhoenix> dubstep is talentless, unthoughtfull, careless and an insult to the music industry
<RaveBrony> valoreins: hmm?
<MegaMoonShine> Sorry bout that, technical difficulties and whatnot :$
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix how and why?
<valoreins> RaveBrony: castlevania reference
<RaveBrony> Ooooh, lol
<Lil_B> valoreins What is a man?
<CrimsonPhoenix> because you don't need talent, you don't have to think, you don't have to care
<RaveBrony> Never played castlevania...always wished i had :(
<MegaMoonShine> But yeah, I've been fine alexxm
<valoreins> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> and music is a form of art like every media that needs consideration and decision to decide what fits
<TrixieBaconMuffin> What is a pony ? An adorable little pile of friendship!
<RaveBrony> Does anypony else in here draw??
<MusicalPony> well, that about does it for me everyone. its time for me to leave.
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as following a theme
<MusicalPony> Goodbye everypony.
<RainBowJack> and a Friendship cannon
<MusicalPony> ill see you when i can
<RaveBrony> Bye MusicalPony!
<MegaMoonShine> Bye MusicalPony :)
<Dken2021> bye MusicalPony , will miss ya
<appledash6> bye
<Tovler> the way all dupstep song have their drop at 0:55 seems purposefully uncreative.
<valoreins> the sound is on
<Phase4> 00,02Tovler, the majority of dubstep is uncreative, purposefully or not
<Barbetos> Whoa
<Barbetos> Ponies anthology 2?
<Phase4> 00,02but i think thats true for most things anyway
<Phase4> 00,02wait what
<Phase4> 00,02wasnt that due for season 3?
<Barbetos> Look at link
<CK|Catnap> Still private. ;_;
<Dken2021> Tovler well that's just hte UFK thing
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<CK|Catnap> It'll debut at the con, I expect it'll become public after that.
<RaveBrony> :o
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Clicks link , sees add , sees Chrysalis shirt , is tempted
<XAX> Phase4 should stream Ponies the anthology 2 now
<XAX> lol
<Chrysalis> TrixieBaconMuffin i have 2 on order for when i get to BUCk :P
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, i would if it wern't private
<XAX> D:
<XAX> ikr
<MegaMoonShine> Is anything streaming right now? I can't see
<appledash6> money
<Barbetos> Hm. Stupid decieving eqd post. They are probably going to show it on the stream for brony con I bet.
<Kencolt> One must have patience, youth. One must have-- dammit, can't hardly wait-- patience.
<appledash6> <3:$6_9:'(:D
<Tovler> 1pm? That leaves with enough time to make me a manwich
<LilB> CrimsonPhoenix sry, my internet just went out, I wanted to say that there people in every genre that just blandly copy others without a second thought to it
<MegaMoonShine> It apparently has a running time of 82 minutes :O
<RaveBrony> O_O
<Marx> Panels resume at 1:00PM? What are we gonna be doing for the next hour?
<RaveBrony> stream :)
<Phase4> 00,02i dont have any sound either
<CrimsonPhoenix> LilB, do you mean like the op music today that use auto-tune and eird techno?
<LilB> CrimsonPhoenix good Dubstep is just as hard to make as every other genre and there is work behind good musicians
<Barbetos> I am listening to pony music anyways. =P
<CrimsonPhoenix> LilB, give me one good dubstep song
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU&feature=related
<diddutz> oh streamception
<LilB> CrimsonPhoenix the problem is, if you don't like the genre, than whats the point in showing you a song that, in my opinion, is good, everyone has different tastes
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> fire solved: http://i.imgur.com/CG8M6.png
<Marx> Um, ... Oh hey, Bronycon.
<Marx> Anyway, Apparently, Anthology II is gonna be long. Like, really long compared to the first.
<RaveBrony> Omfg :D
<diddutz> Lone_Lycan|AFK: that looks like a dangerous derpiculty...
<Dken2021> like avatar long?
<CCCP> YAY!
<Kencolt> Well, that explains everytyhing.
<MegaMoonShine> Marx: Yeah, I read it had a running time of 82 mins
<RainBowJack> did a lamp explode?
<RaveBrony> That is awesome, Lone_Lycan|AFK
<appledash6> brony

<Kencolt> RainBowJack: Not explode as such. it more caught on fire slowly.

<KingQBall> NO NOT THE FIRE NATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<legacyofvrak> Ponies47: Because Spiderman is a brony :D
<RaveBrony> Spiderman does what he wants! :[
<MegaMoonShine> I used to be an adventurer like you...
<Alchemist> did the interviewers get hijacked?
<Lil_B> Nice Guy Fire
<Ponies47> legacyofvrak: :P
<legacyofvrak> Ponies47: F**K YOU I DO WHAT I WANT
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> "The light fixture was burning calmly." lol
<Lil_B> Good Guy Fire*
<Ponies47> legacyofvrak: :P
<alexxm> good guy fire
<CK|Catnap> Light fixtures always burn calmly, because they're incapable of getting excited.
<Barbetos> Small fire happens, and the guys reporting seem to panic more than everyone else.
<Kencolt> Well, at least the light fixture wasn't burning nervously. That would have been a disaster.
<Alchemist> I vote for calm.
<Tovler> Combust, you say?
<Chrysalis> dont like her voice
<legacyofvrak> LOL
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> i remember when i was working at a sonic drive-in and the fryers caught fire...
<Jim> how fitting name
<Tovler> sound like every other voice in america
<Lil_B> she stairs in various Souls
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> i was like... guys... guys.. i think there's a fire over there... guys?
<Kencolt> Um... Combust? Too Soon?
<diddutz> Tovler: no, there was a light burning not a lemon
<Alchemist> :D
<RaveBrony> yepyep
<legacyofvrak> Eeeyup
<Jim> Doctor Who? This is relevant to my interests
<alexxm> yep yep
<RaveBrony> ^

<Lil_B> ACS13123 I popped out the Stream for the Everfree Radio and pout it next to the Chat noiw :)
<Tovler> I would have figured Jayson and Wootton would have filled in for Rob Renzetti
<ACS13123> Lil_B: Dat works :p
<Kencolt> AgentKalim: Maybe the reason the evacuation was so orderly was becausem someone played a polka.
<Lil_B> ACS13123 Problem number 2, low internet connection suddenly, constent buffering XD
<AgentKalim> Interesting, I didn't think of that. But it seems plausible.
<Obsidian> I need to leave now. Enjoy the stream everypony!

<killerpony7733> RaveBrony: Very much so, i just sat and laughed at the worse then worst trolling level from them :D
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: I yelled at him
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Did you see the meme: I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!

<Floris> Froze again!

<GilDash> FairysHuff: Always the best way. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> well this sucks
<RaveBrony> killerpony7733: Yeah :D
<FairysHuff> GilDash: Yup
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: I'm guessing it's your computer that you're using.
<Tovler> Trolls still use gay as an attack. They need to realize it's the 2010s
<Floris> Haha! The crash has been doubled!:|
<GilDash> FairysHuff: It's like the pic of that guy protesting against gay rights, and that other guy stood there with a sign saying "Fuck this guy" pointing at him. :D
<Dark92Enigma> FairysHuff Oh, now that's a Goddamn plan

<RAWRity> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/pokmon-ash-will-never-get-with-this1.jpg
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: Well... at least it's not on fire.
<Chrysalis> someone turn the lights on to thaw the stream
<Tovler> lol, that new turtle is wearing a SWAT vest

<the_real_pony_1604> down
<Chrysalis> tara strong is best raver
<AgentKalim> ^
<killerpony7733> Om you should had seen the ''troll'' attack we had earlier today, it was more funny and a bit sad then annoying :D
<AttackWithHugs> FairysHuff: It's Ponies47's step brother lol. You have to get his approval
<AgentKalim> Ah yes, the "trolls"
<Chrysalis> oh come on
<Om> killerpony7733: Most trolls are sad. The best trolls are the ones you don't know are trolls
<Chrysalis> these guys dont give enough rage o be trolls
<[iPad]JRP2234> Omg
<AttackWithHugs> Where were you when the "trolls" arrived?
<Major_Frank> This is just a funny story:
<Chrysalis> there little chihuahas
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/29/wqqFKbW4WkuIoLYxjntOdg2.gif
<Chrysalis> yappy but oh so cute
<Floris> I wish they'd change streams.. Most people wanna see the voice actors :p
<AgentKalim> Please don't tell me the stream crashed again.
<killerpony7733> Om Indeed those guys simply failed beyond failure
<[iPad]JRP2234> Guys did my song just get ..
<Kencolt> RAWRity: That's a good one.
<Chrysalis> Floris they can't do anything, its the venues internet dying
<RaveBrony> RAWRity: I like that alot :D
<Dken2021> RAWRity lol
<Sundaysmile> stream's down again
<Major_Frank> My friend is a Brolan; he hates Bronies. And i'm a Brony. And we both have no clue of eachother
<Floris> Chrysalis: I know, I know.. Q,Q
<Om> killerpony7733: Those were just imbecilic blood sacks.
<RaveBrony> Ah! FlareChaser! I think I had a break through o_o testing something that...just...might...work...
<Dken2021> meanwhile on second stream: people arguing the powers of twilight sparkle
<killerpony7733> Om if you were there you would had laughed your guts out from the hilarity of how bad they were :O!
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: k :3
<Dken2021> you heard it here: Celestia is making Twilight Wolverine
<twilight_sprinkle> well we've pretty much missed the VA panel..
<Om> killerpony7733: I doubt that, but I'm sure your words have merit.
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/13/tHvw8CCKO0Sd2I8hDXHxYQ2.jpg
<Hawkie> raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar
<Floris> Rawrity: Awesome!

<Dken2021> did they seriously compare twilight to wolverine?
<RAWRity> ACS13123: congratulations

<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/28/ojAnn2VakEqoM3_Y-40kbg2.png

<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix: Long hair? you gain 1 interwebs from me :O
<LilB> Stream is back... kinda... not really
<Dark92Enigma> Damn my random caps reference
<Major_Frank> Shame long hair isnt allowed here..
<DashieMusic2> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<killerpony7733> Major_Frank: Say what?
<Major_Frank> I cant have longer hair then i have now
<Major_Frank> You see
<twilight_sprinkle> ouch
<killerpony7733> Major_Frank: Whys that?
<twilight_sprinkle> dat illusory magic
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
<Dark92Enigma> What are they saying
<TrixieBaconMuffin> are you in the military ?
<Dark92Enigma> Oh wait
<AgentKalim> Implying the sun is an illusion
<AgentKalim> Nigga wat
<Dken2021> the sun is a illusion?
<the_real_pony_1604> I can't listen to that 2nd stream, not because of what they are saying but because the audio is blasting far too much and over modulated
<Tovler> Jigga who
<twilight_sprinkle> how dare they promote limitation of Twi's magic
<twilight_sprinkle> She should roast their asses
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Glad to be back home with signal strong enough for the streat to run - did I miss anything?
<Dken2021> they always gotta put the purple pony down
<Dark92Enigma> FUCK THE YOUTUBE ADS! THEY MADE ME THINK THAT THERE WAS A REACTION
<AgentKalim> Rrrrriiiight, well... that was something.
<CK|Catnap> It's time. :3
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma have you tried adblock
<Major_Frank> TrixieBaconMuffin I actually was yes :)
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle I got nothing......are you sure it's the right stream?
<AgentKalim> We should be seeing Ponies the Anthology 2
<Major_Frank> Well
<Major_Frank> Kindoff
<RAWRity> what if there's no actual Bronycon, and this is all an elaborate troll by Hasbro?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> still curious about the hair issue
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm It worked for me before, but not now
*Tovler watches the Ponies anthology 2 while waiting for the pony anthology 2.
<RAWRity> All the people who we see who SAY they're at Bronycon is actually just people being paid to do so.
<valoreins> its already 1 AM here, where's the PMVs panel?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: 2ND JUST STOPPED
<alexxm> odd Dark92Enigma
<Ponies47> There. I blocked bronystate on my brothers computer. So now we don't have to worry about them trolling anymore :)
<Tovler> 1:22:01 good lord that's too long
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: wups caps
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: Damnit, I wish I could've been in on that
<Marx> This is it Luigi!-Er Everyone!
<Dark92Enigma> RAWrity probably a tribute to Edvard Gil (R.I.P. Trolololo guy)
<AttackWithHugs> Anyone have the link to the second stream?
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Even so he hadly trolls it's just being a plain idiot really
<LilB> valoreins PMV Panel got cancelled because of thie fire
<Dark92Enigma> TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: actually still streaming but panel is over
<FlareChaser> ...
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle Damn it
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Fire?
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Yeah. But still we don't have to worry about them anymore :)
<valoreins> LilB: isnt the anon artist that got cancelled?
<valoreins> pmvs got rescheduled
<Floris> Sod it! Gonna play TF2 on the Ponyville server!
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: there is a switch stream button right of the stream window
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Indeed unless he gains a brain and knows how to unblock the site
<Floris> Will hear when it is back on!
<twilight_sprinkle> Doesnt matter, VA panel is over and De Lancies panel isnt for another hour or two
<[iPad]JRP2234> I got the most strangest offer
<LilB> valoreins I think i heard that from the Equestrian News guy, but I (or he) could be wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> there are some less interesting panels before that but yeah
<Dken2021> oh neat, anthology 2 is public now
<valoreins> ok
<AttackWithHugs> Dken2021: Link please?
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Nah. He's to much of a moron to realize. I really hate him and my brother so much :|
<Dken2021> Ponies: The Anthology II http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA
<LilB> whats this Anthology 2 everyon is talking about?
<Tovler> so many 8-bit ponies
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle you mean ''Switch to IRIS AJAX''
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Yeah i guess i'll feel with you there
<Dken2021> and cool anamanaguchi
<Tassadork> forget the mumbling... must watch anthology 2!
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont get why people like the antalogy so much, all the author was just post some voices/music over pony vids, not impressive editing
<RAWRity> looking at the length of Anthology 2...well we won't have to worry about it getting overplayed on the stream at least.
<DashieMusic2> what?!
<Tassadork> it's 80 minutes LONG!
<RAWRity> seriously, 1h22m!
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: no im talking about the 2nd stream on the everfree site, not the chat
<RaveBrony> Were missing it right now, right?
<Dken2021> and something tells me anamanaguchi is gonna be spammed to the moon with ponies
<RaveBrony> it started at 2?
<Kencolt> Ponies47: The thing is, he's rather pathetic at trolling. As in, Scootaloo flies better than he trolls, Sweetie Belle cooks better than he trolls, and Apple Bloom dances better than he trolls. So, not so good.
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Yeah. My brother made him into a hater and now there over doing it. :|
<AgentKalim> Sweetie Belle cooks better than he trolls
<Tovler> oo, a Monk reference
<AgentKalim> :D
<LilB> SERIOUSLY?! I can't watch the Anthology 2 Video in my Country?! DAMN you GEMA!
<DashieMusic2> ITS OUT
<twilight_sprinkle> Tovler: the detective?
<icybeauti> Hi guys, I see you're streaming bronycon.
<the_real_pony_1604> anthology is up on youtube
<Tovler> twilight_sprinkle: yep
<the_real_pony_1604> working, not private
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Still i hope it helps to know he is more then just bad at it?
<alexxm> hey icybeauti hows yoru day been
<icybeauti> GOING@!
<Dken2021> hai icybeauti anthology ii is out
<DashieMusic2> pony the anthology just came out!
<twilight_sprinkle> Tovler: lol that was a good show
<alexxm> LilB what is GEMA
<Ponies47> Kencolt: His trolling was bad. But I did block bronystate on my brothers computer so we don'y have to worry any more. :)
<icybeauti> hey alexxm and Dken2021 Imma go watch it brb.
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: inb4 it's played on the stream a billion times
<Kencolt> Ponies47: Has he got the smarts to unblock it?
<CK|Catnap> Damn this is a long intro.
<AgentKalim> They better fix the internet before John de Lancie is up, or imma smack a bitch.
<twilight_sprinkle> well im going to go die in the fanzone, cyall in an hour or
<Tovler> inb4 a noob tell a mod to stream the anthology
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: Yeah I guess so. But now I'm really pissed off at him and my brother :|
<LilB> alexxm german version of the MIRR
<twilight_sprinkle> *or so
<alexxm> ok LilB
<legacyofvrak> I'm gonna have lunch... Back in 2 hours
<Ponies47> Kencolt: He's a complete dumb(squee). So nope! :)
<CK|Catnap> XD
<Kencolt> Ponies47: I sort of susuepcted as much.
<CK|Catnap> ...>XD
<CK|Catnap> Good start.
<Ponies47> Kencolt: His trolling did suck. I've seen better. Much better.
<valoreins> why havent i see any parents or kids at the bronycon? :p
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> O_o so much to catch up on...forgot Bronycon was this week
<Sundaysmile> because 18-27 year old demographic?
*Ponies47 Wishes he could of gone to bronycon :(
<valoreins> oh ya...
<CK|Catnap> ....
<Marx> Oh come one. Everfree, do not let this happen again! I want to watch it live with everyone!
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: *could've, and yeah me too
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ponies47: there's a Brony Fan Fair in Texas in September
*CK|Catnap is laughing so hard.
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf|Pirate: I live in Wisconsin! :d
<Barbetos> lol
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ponies47: :) You can make it
<Kencolt> The very fact that a stream is even OFFERED is amazing, really. That's NOThow other large cons work.
*Ripred 4glomps ray
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle Now i got what you meant......wish i've done it SOONER
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: :d
<valoreins> true dat Kencolt
<LilB> afk, setting up TOR so i can watch the Anthology Video :/
<RAWRity> you know...watching Anthology 2 makes me realize something: Anthology 1 wasn't actually funny at all.
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf|Pirate: There's the Canterlot Gardens in Iowa in September. But I can't drive I'm only 14 :/
*Ray eeps and glomps back :3
<Dken2021> anthology... just ... :D
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: i never thought it was funny at all.
<twilight_sprinkle> and neither is it good editing
<CK|Catnap> I wouldn't go that far.
<[iPad]JRP2234> My sound cloud got the most awkward comment
<twilight_sprinkle> 1st one at least, idk 2nd
<Tovler> You mean pop culture references aren't funny?
<Marx> Spoilers are already coming out. Browse with caution.
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ponies47: I know that feel - always either transportation or lack of bits
<twilight_sprinkle> Tovler: references arent funny by themsleves, its just a reference, i dont get how its funny
<CK|Catnap> It was funny the first time. It becomes a lot less funny after twenty million views.
<twilight_sprinkle> Tovler: if they just quote someth i dont see how its a joke
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf|Pirate: yeah :(
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Catnap: i didnt find it funny the first time either
<CK|Catnap> >implying jokes are the only funny things
<[iPad]JRP2234> Sumica bacon
<twilight_sprinkle> well just quoting isnt funny imo
<CK|Catnap> That's wonderful, and also your opinion. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> it wasnt even related, just qoute+ponies
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Missed out on 2 cons in May & June in Houston & Dallas where brony meetups were held I couldnt go to - saving money to hit the ones in August through October
<Tovler> It's funny because I got the reference and it was barely relevant to ponies
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf|Pirate: No bronycon's in Wisconsin what so ever :(
<Barbetos> !!!! This is awesome!! I just learned some one made a pony plushie for my gaming community: http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v301/Psiclone/?action=view&current=1-3.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> i personally dont laugh at justquotes, doesnt take any effort
<twilight_sprinkle> i can make a quote vid in 15 mins
<valoreins> second stream is up i think
<twilight_sprinkle> 2nd stream was never down, yeah
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ponies47: I know a Houston group is working to build a Brony con here, some time next year
<CK|Catnap> That's wonderful, and also your opinion. :P
<Barbetos> http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v301/Psiclone/?action=view&current=2-4.jpg
<CK|Catnap> :p
*Barbetos life complete
<AttackWithHugs> Who has the link to the second straem
<AttackWithHugs> stream*
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> Ponies47: were talking about trying to get Lauren Faust and the VA's for it eventually
<CK|Catnap> Ha.
<Tovler> hey look Gilbert Gotfried's voice is coming out of Rarity. That's all I need to laugh.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Catnap: well the fact aht it doesnt take much effort isnt really sas much of an opinion
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf|Pirate: Nice. We gotta get a bronycon started here in Wisconsin. Ah one will come up sometime (I hope)
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> at the beach meetup yesterday
<CK|Catnap> That one. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> i want to go to the Tabitha meetup
<valoreins> gang fight gang fight the gang is out to fight yeah, have you got a chicken for us to eat..
<Tovler> Look, they used Science but as a verb. Odd vocabulary makes me laugh
<CK|Catnap> twilight_spinkle: It is your opinion that Anthology isn't funny. Fine. We know. Now shush and let ponies enjoy it if they like it. :p
<Barbetos> Its really up this time guys
<Barbetos> The pony anthology video
<CK|Catnap> I know, I've been watching it.
<CK|Catnap> It's pretty good so far.
<the_real_pony_1604> 10 minutes into it myself
<Barbetos> Be back in an hour. =P
<valoreins> im gonna watch that tomorrow
<twilight_sprinkle> me too^
<Tassadork> me too.
<twilight_sprinkle> the be back in hour thing <.<
<RAWRity> 11 mins into anthology 2. I have smirked once.
<Tassadork> err, me too also watching
<Kencolt> Hmm... seems like I have som,ething towatch after all. Back laters.
<twilight_sprinkle> valoreins: you ninjaing son of a:D
<valoreins> :s
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> I wish I could zero in on a single conversation going on nearby the mike, I can make out a few things in the garbled noise
<Dken2021> I think it's just garbled noise
<Marx> I'm missing the livestream...
<Marx> Ugh. Once, okay, but screwing up like this twice in a row? Idk.
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> some are speaking loud enough to make out a couple words from time to time
*Big_Macintosh_1992 <<< Wishes he could be there
<Marx> This is exactly what happened with Friendship is Witchcraft yesterday.
<diddutz> Dear GEMA, I've learned a valuable lesson today. YOU SUCK! Your faithfull hater diddutz~
<CK|Catnap> Though, will say I agree with one thing that I think RAWRity touched on: there are parts of the Anthology that are more like broken bits of a PMV.
<Tovler> I'm waiting for a ZA WARUDO or WRYYYY reference
<Cypresswolf|Pirate> I got my phones & volume on max at the moment - hope nopony screams O_o
<alexxm> so any idea whats up with the everfree radio thing
<RAWRity> CK|Catnap: oh definitely. And it was a bit excessive at 25 mins before. Now, they're longer than some feature length films.
<CK|Catnap> Yeah, that's true. There's some bits in here that have really slowed it down.
<RAWRity> I'm sorry but, you can't make "We put MLP clips to various bits of music for 30 seconds" entertaining for 80 minutes.
<AgentKalim> Suddenly, ears blasted.
<Tassadork> someone will have to make ponies the anthology the highlights
<Saminham> lol.
<CK|Catnap> That's fair, the PMV bits aren't really funny....though I'm not sure they're supposed to be funny. PMVs usually aren't....
<diddutz> stream is back <3
<valoreins> stream!
<the_real_pony_1604> GAH!!!! freaked me out, had the stream still open
<Tovler> Hey look. A Monk reference
<CK|Catnap> Monk reference was awesome.
<Tovler> Its funny, because I saw that show
<Tassadork> I still only hear mumbling
<Ponies47> ^
<RAWRity> It's not even about being funny. Making short little PMVs of different songs and throwing them together just...stops doing anything for me past the 10 minute mark.
<diddutz> Tassadork: bronystate is a few minutes behind
<valoreins> bronystate stream is late 3 minutes from the livestream
<the_real_pony_1604> i had the bronycon stream open not the bronystate
<RainBowJack> there was a fire?
<Saminham> RaveBrony: pic?
<Chrysalis> for those experiencing lag
<Chrysalis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA
<AgentKalim> I think Ponies the Anthology 2 is back on now.
<CK|Catnap> ._.
<CK|Catnap> Well that's random.
<Dken2021> AgentKalim why yes it is
<RaveBrony> Saminham: What??
<RaveBrony> O.o
<LilB> buck you GEMA! You can't prevent me from watching Ponies Anthology 2!
<Saminham> RaveBrony: chicken :3
<Sundaysmile> stream's up
<FlareChaser> good.
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: I s'pose
<AgentKalim> I think I
<Chrysalis> RAWRity this is a 1h10min vid
<Marx> :D
<Tassadork> ha,I was ahead of this part on youtube...
<valoreins> a rock...
<AgentKalim> I think I'd rather watch the community VA's right now
<CrimsonPhoenix> AgentKalim, eeew
<LilB> TOR make sit possible >: D
<RaveBrony> I want liveness :'(
<RAWRity> "oh hey, we made a short bit where Rainbow Dash does stuff while "Rainbow in the Dark" plays. That wasn't done over a year ago, was it?"
*CK|Catnap loves the Rock references.
<Chrysalis> WUB
<valoreins> heavy pinkie?
<Chrysalis> i approve of heavy pinkie
<valoreins> :o
<AttackWithHugs> lol
<Cynder7> 6prince-lemon? o.0
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<valoreins> dafaq lol
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: The fandom's too fast. If it exists, pony of it pops up instantly. :P
<Om> Hello WallDives
<Tovler> that Armageddon thing was actually funny
<Marx> You guys better be watching this. It's hilarious!
<WallDives> hi Om.
<Bronysith> ANTHOLOGY 2 IS ON
