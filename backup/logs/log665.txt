<AJIsAwesome|Tired> *used to
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The intensity gate in the seafloor palace is a dick move
<Panda> okies enough jokes
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> SpadeMagnes[School]: YES. I HATE that one. :|
<Dragonmatte> You need pie
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Requires 8.0 but all it does is give a alternate path
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> 9.0 my ass.
<Dragonmatte> And you know it
<Sumica> 00,10wreky has been flying them for some time
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Er 9.0
<MadSurge> Sumica: put that instead of Twilight :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The inside view flying this thing is so nausiating
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Plus, Thanatos fight is cheap.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Especially Sword Thanatos. :|
<Panda> Ya know... I thought wreks voice was a little more gruff... but... its kinda soothing with this music XD
<Bronysith> oh hey wrek is videoing himself
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|Tired: can't get past some stages from 8.0 on :(
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Same.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I can't 9.0 The Ring Of Chaos. Stupid Pit.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Trying to kill cragalanch via front only is a pain
<MadSurge> See guys? Wrek's OC REALLY looks like him! :D
<Ghost_Nappa> :(
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm still trying to 9.0 Cragalanche with the cannon.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> It's an achievement in the game.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|Tired: 9.0 Hades fight is easier than most of the other level :(
<Ghost_Nappa> im at Twinbellows
<Ghost_Nappa> lol
<Panda> Glitch up dat mountain!!!!
<Dragonmatte> Dangit humbleindiebundle shut up and take my money!
<MadSurge> *s
<SpadeMagnes[School]> One achivement requires you to kill Bellows before he even raors
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Highest I got was 7.0 from Hades, I think.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *roars
<Dragonmatte> Paypal wont take them though :I
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: done :D
<Ghost_Nappa> i did that
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> SpadeMagnes[School]: I HATE that one. :|
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The boss theme is bitching though
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ^
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome|Tired: 0.0, get something powerful like a cannon :D
<Ghost_Nappa> SpadeMagnes[School: i did the acheivement

<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Oh yeah, that too.
<Applejack2011> and the Swedish Wonderbolt
<Bronysith> this song seems familiar
<Panda> Wrek must have dual screens or one large screen.
<Bronysith> what game is this song from?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm guessing dual screens. One for the game and the othe for observing the chat
<Bronysith> oh right
<Bronysith> star craft
<Bronysith> DOY
<Panda> XD
<Jmo> Who doesn't run dual monitors these days.
<Panda> Jmo I dont
<Jmo> Jesus christ you poor soul.
<Jmo> I could never go back to a single monitor ;~;
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't either
<Panda> Jmo I dont have a need for it ^^ I'm distracted as it is :)
<Bronysith> i either need 2 monitors or 1 huge one
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I have dual monitors, but that's because I have two computers. :P
<Bronysith> i can just get more shit done with 2
<Jmo> Oh you demona.
<Bronysith> and when i mean get shit done. you know what i mean
<Bronysith> MUHAHAHAH
<ASoftFluffyThing> There's not enough room in my sister's place for a desktop.
<Gold_Demona> And the one monitor is the whole computer. LOl XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Furniture in my room takes up all the space so there's little walking room
<Panda> Wrek, you a dick XD

<killerpony7733> Dunno?
<killerpony7733> I signed up for the beta a long while ago and i haven't gotten a invite at all
<Barbetos|AtWork> They should be sending out more. They just wiped the servers
<Barbetos|AtWork> Last friday?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Also it helps if you had an account and played the first one too.
<killerpony7733> I doubt i'll get any key but if i do yay but i'm not setting my hopes high
<Barbetos|AtWork> Eh. Anything that gets done right now gets reset anyways. It will be f2p on launch so you will get to play for sure.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Just a matter of time
<killerpony7733> Maybe
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wow
<Barbetos|AtWork> So much lag.
<FiMFlamFilosophy> Hello
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hi FiMFlamFilosophy :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hey FiMFlamFilosophy
<ChangelingSlayer> ello FiMFlamFilosophy
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo FiMFlamFilodophy
<Barbetos|AtWork> Love the videos from that channel XD
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> If I were to play as Soldier from TF2, what weapons do you recommend (Primary, Secondary, etc.)?
<thelonepony> hi FiMFlamFilosophy
<Applejack2011> hi
<Barbetos|AtWork> AJIsAwesome|Tired: you would want to play the Heavy class. They are more akin to the Engi class from BF3 though.
<alexxm> hey guys
<Barbetos|AtWork> Except.. minus the repairs, and the Heavy in PS2 gets an extra shield
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hi alexxm
<Hanako> AJIsAwesome|Tired: Just use default weapons at first
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hm....seems interesting. Considering that I'm new to TF2, I would use Soldier since he seems simple to use.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hi, alexxm :)
<thelonepony> hi alexxm :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Honestly though just starting out AJIsAwesome|Tired I would recommend either light assault or medic, better survivability all around for those classes
<Applejack2011> hi
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Okay. Thanks.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Light assualt can get C4 for pretty cheap too
<alexxm> how are things AJIsAwesome|Tired thelonepony and Applejack2011
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Pretty good. How about you, alexxm?
<thelonepony> great alexxm and you?
<Applejack2011> I'm fine
<FiMFlamFilosophy> who thinks im an imposter
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hm?
<alexxm> i'm good thelonepony
<DashWithRainbows> Huh, it's only $40 to get instant access...
<DashWithRainbows> 'Tis a shame I need to get a computer that is capable of running this game.
<killerpony7733> FiMFlamFilosophy Thing is when using a name of someone popular in a said community and since this site has a easy ability to change nicks it's very doubtful due to how easy it is try and act like said person
<killerpony7733> You can be everyone on the internet

<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya trollhunter
*Dark92Enigma (cue Short People)
<Kammerjunk> I am digging this music.
<trollhunter> what we watching
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Planetside 2.
<Kammerjunk> I should probably buy this game some time.
<RaveBrony> how much is it?
<Wrek> 05f2p
<RaveBrony> O:
<Wrek> 05but if you want isntant beta access
<Wrek> 0540 bucks
<RaveBrony> Aw damn :D
<DashWithRainbows> Which is about £25
<Wrek> 05(those 40 bucks will give you a shitlaod of ingame stuff at launch)
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek Should I buy it and then save up for a better computer?
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Wrek> 05to test if you can run it ;O
*RaveBrony has no money and feels bad man.
<DashWithRainbows> True.
<DashWithRainbows> Wish games would do performance demos, only something small to see if your computer can handle the full game.
<Kammerjunk> Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
<DashWithRainbows> I'll go see how much is in my bank.
<Kammerjunk> I know what's in my bank. Approximately squat diddle.
<Kammerjunk> Or diddly-squat.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows I could easily buy this game with all the money from my birthday but idunno not sure with this game as of yet. Plus i have no beta access so i can't really decide
<DashWithRainbows> Well, Wrek has told me quite a bit of what the game contains and I can only say that it would be a worthy purchase if you love FPS's.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> no stream?
<killerpony7733> Streams on for me
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ok
<DashWithRainbows> Getting some buffers on my end but that is due to me playing C&C:TA as well.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Oh C&C 3 right?
<DashWithRainbows> Aye, Command and conquer 3: Tiberium alliance :3
<Kammerjunk> Used to play a whole lot of Generals.
<DashWithRainbows> I still do.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Er. wat?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Wait a minute.
<twilight_sprinkle> fahrenheit sucks!
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Let me look at that again.
<donutpop365> Well, I mean more people choosing the same thing ups the probability, but it's not based on majority.
<donutpop365> Twighlight moment :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Planet loading screen 2
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> I guess he is preparing to fly?

<cowvarkian> Barbetos|AtWork: one might think that
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Dovah: What's the joke/
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> *?
<Obsidian> Fly into the DANGER ZONE
<ekips> dat sc2 terran soundtrack
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome|Tired: look at the high temps
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: there are also limits to what you can chose. has to be at least 6 months fora movie to be replayed, and one movie is a high-budget and/or have good ratings, whereas as b movie is a cult movie
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Okay
<Dark_Horst> now he only needs to fire off random dropship quotes during the game
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> NOW I get it. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: a vs b is pretty confusing though, at times. theres more on the faq
<cowvarkian> brb, going to reheat some food
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Speaking of food, brb.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Obsidian: so we'll be flying towards the enemy, into what you could call, a zone...
<Obsidian> Pretty much
<DoctoDoctorWho> Obsidian: And that zone, is filled with danger...
<twilight_sprinkle> so, violence, cursing and 3+. seems legit
<donutpop365> Alright then, looking at the backlog seems useful.
<DashWithRainbows> Not to mention discrimination twilight_sprinkle.
<twilight_sprinkle> ah, so thats what the third one is
<Obsidian> twilight_sprinkle: Its fun for the whole family!
<twilight_sprinkle> lol :D
<donutpop365> twilight_sprinkle: WOAH! What's a movie in the C category?
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: i think thats WMC-worst movie clause
<Dark_Horst> probably homevideo
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh and that reminds me of this pony http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110301021551/mlp/images/thumb/b/b1/Madden.jpg/150px-Madden.jpg

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
<Reikim> Well that kind of sucks hard.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Although constantly posting images can strike some ire from the mods as well.
<Dark_Horst> ....did that tank just drive up the stairs?
<donutpop365> Hello my Minnesotan friend even though I don't know you (yet).
<flutterbrony123> i thought it was a vid
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if they did my steam library would be a lot bigger

<flutterloves> im back
<MadSurge> Oh, hello donutpop365! New?
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> It's Gamecube. :P
<cowvarkian> ekips: looks like amiga to me
<Kimori> Dawn of the dragon? I played through it, loved the game
<donutpop365> Yes I am :P
<Dovah> My pet peeves: 1) Not knowing things. 2) people who dont use common sence. 3) people who correct the littlest things.
<RedDragonX> it was alright for what it was
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Yes, yes I am.
<RedDragonX> after that I got enticed by my buds to play TOR
<cowvarkian> Dovah: that's nice
<Dark_Horst> guys, its clearly sega
<DashWithRainbows> Dovah sense*
<Garettbrony> at
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: sure it's not atari?
<Kimori> TOR?
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> I knew someone would correct Dovah :D
<MadSurge> donutpop365: welcome to Bronystate then! :)
<Tomatos> So, we watching Call of Duty?
<Dovah> DashWithRainbows: thanks! :)
<RedDragonX> The Old Republic, it's that STar wars MMO
<Garettbrony> woah who is that man playing

<Obsidian> Tomatos: Planetside 2
<ekips> Tomatos yes
<MadSurge> Garettbrony: Wrek!
<Dark_Horst> man, i want to play that game so bad
<cowvarkian> Dovah: It looked like thinly veiled sarcasm to me...
<Garettbrony> so thats what wrek looks like
<MadSurge> Yep!
<DashWithRainbows> Tomatos It's a Halo and CoD crossover.
<RedDragonX> and now it's Guild Wars 2
<Dovah> cowvarkian: what did?
<Tomatos> So then this is an Xbox game.
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Thanks!
<cowvarkian> Dovah: oh. nothing
<Obsidian> Tomatos: PC
<ekips> Garettbrony ikr, I've imagined him completely different from what he actually looks like :D
<DashWithRainbows> Nah, It's Planetside 2.
<Garettbrony> so did I
<Dark_Horst> DashWithRainbows: actually, it's halo/battlefield
<Dark_Horst> cod is somethign compeltely different
<MadSurge> donutpop365: did you read the rules?
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: actually, it's generic sci fi shooter/ generic modern shooter
<Tomatos> I don't know...I don't think PC has this kind of graphics.
<flutterloves> read the rules
<DashWithRainbows> Tomatos It does.
<Garettbrony> he looks like a top gun fighter pilot Wrek
<Garettbrony> You
<cachi01|phone> Hi bronystate :)
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Naruto: "Believe It!"
<Obsidian> Tomatos: You would be surprised
<DashWithRainbows> Computers can have way higher specs than consoles.
<shibaru> Apparently most of my friends get "watcha doin?" and "How is you?" confused
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: if you call the biggest maps so far in a multiplayer shooter generic, sure
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> hi cachi01|phone
<ekips> the next time Wrek dies, I have to go to bed >.>
<donutpop365> MadSurge: I am right now.
<Obsidian> Hello cachi01|phone
<Tomatos> Last game I played on PC was Doom.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: no, I'm saying it looks like the gameplay is that, not the actual game
<cachi01|phone> Hi AjIsAwesome and Obsidian :)
<DashWithRainbows> You're right Wrek, it's for the Wii.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: overall
<Meanwhile> The Wii couldn't render that gun by itselg.
<Meanwhile> itself*
<Dark_Horst> didnt look very generic to me
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> :d
<Tomatos> The Wii is pretty cool.
<Garettbrony> Wrek you look like a top gun fighter pilot
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: when did you get here?
<Meanwhile> I AM ALWAYS HERE.
<Dark_Horst> running around with a gun doesnt count as generic
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> He lurks.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: mmk
<Dark_Horst> thats like saying walking is generic
<Meanwhile> No not really I've had the chat open for a while but I was on TF2.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: isnt it?

<Everlasting_Joy> Tomatos: That's wrek.
<Meanwhile> Well, guess that's one incentive to improve your aim.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: # 43 then?
<Dark_Horst> that window doesnt want to get trespassed
<Kimori> I havent actually played the third game yet, havent had the time
<Tomatos> Everlasting_Joy: I don't think he looks like a wreck, he looks awesome.

<cowvarkian> Garettbrony: the plan to die?
<cowvarkian> Everlasting_Joy: I never said he was
<Garettbrony> all part of the plan
<Kimori> We have had a few new names show up this week but they seem to leave right away if they just see a few names
<Tomatos> cowvarkian: I think you mean marklar sure is getting marklared a lot.
<Meanwhile> Iirc Wrek plays a sort of infiltrator stealth support type, he's not really built for all the close up engagement he's doing.
<Everlasting_Joy> cowvarkian: touche.
<Garettbrony> cowvarkian are you the doctor of death?\
<cowvarkian> Everlasting_Joy: indubiadly

<cowvarkian> Mozdoc: blue : the game
<Tomatos> I find it offensive that there's two white guys in the far left image and only one black guy.
<Dark_Horst> Mozdoc: planetside 1
<Dark_Horst> *2
<donutpop365> Yep, A Linux, Apache, MySWL, Python or PHP server is the first enemy of earthbound :P
<Meanwhile> Tomatos: that icon is a warning label for Discrimination. :P
<Paspie> lol
<Dark_Horst> and he'S playing the blue guys at night

<MadSurge> So donutpop365, do you have a favorite pony?
<Spectrum_Rush> mud
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Sayin' okeydokeylokey doesn't count as roleplaying does it? I've kinda made a habit out of using that.
<Meanwhile> Brony is a unisex term anyway.
<Kimori> Did you end up collecting it?
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> ^
<Wrek> 05flutterdash: your sex doesnt matter here, we treat everyoen equally

<MadSurge> donutpop365: good for you :D
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Planetside 2

<RedDragonX> I'll prolly try it out
<Everlasting_Joy> A god?
<weeping_pegasi82> a time lord
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Got it, Captain McAwesomeFace.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Captain McAwesomeFace
<Meanwhile> Lo T.

<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: Isn't it "burrits"?
<RedDragonX> Spyrorocks still lurking about now and then lol?
<Dark_Horst> no idea
<Barbetos|AtWork> All Vanu Sovereignty are bitches.
<Kimori> He hasnt talked in a month..
<weeping_pegasi82> not a very practical choice
<Obsidian> Okay Big McLargeHuge the Awesome Squid
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Meanwhile> Wrek is now http://i.imgur.com/wEHAZ.gif
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Shouldn't you change your name then?
<RedDragonX> ah
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh come on!
<flutterloves> WREK WHO IS BEST PONY
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: :D.
<Kimori> We always try to get his attention when hes here but so far nothings worked
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Meanwhile: SO HANDSOME!
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: pfft
<RedDragonX> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> XD
<Meanwhile> Wrek's favourite pony is Twilight.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wow
<weeping_pegasi82> he's in the applejack theater isn't he?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I think he has a buddy
<cowvarkian> I'm guessing wrek is terran, right
<flutterloves> @wrek who is best pony?
<Dark_Horst> Big Awesomeface McLargeHuge of house Squid
<Everlasting_Joy> weeping_pegasi82: There are no theaters at this time.
<Derpy_Hooves> who is that in the corner? :D
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Side theaters are only open on new pony eps and BMN.
<RedDragonX> trust me he knows how to talk :P
<Meanwhile> flutterloves: He'd say Twilight/.
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Derpy_Hooves: Wrek.
<MadSurge> donutpop365: I like Pinkie and Fluttershy, but everyone here has their favorites :D
<flutterloves> oh sorry

<Meanwhile> Stop killing yourself.
<DashWithRainbows> Well...
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Sun and Moon: A Pony Strategy Game
<Derpy_Hooves> wrek: HOW MUCH for those shades?!
<DashWithRainbows> Screw you too Planetside.
<Barbetos|AtWork> They have such a lame back story
<flutterloves> out of the three types of ponies who would you be?
<Mozdoc> That's a slap to the face when you die. Game tells you "STOP KILLING YOURSELF!".
<flutterdash> hi
<RedDragonX> Oh I wouldn't worry about it
<Barbetos|AtWork> It basically goes like this "We are fighting for our liberty!"
<flutterdash> hi everypony :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy flutterdash!
<Kimori> I'm not
<donutpop365> flutterloves: What about alicorns?
<Meanwhile> Anyone who makes an alicorn OC needs a kick in the teeth.
<Dark_Horst> donutpop365: dont even go there
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> ^^
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: That.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<RedDragonX> so who made you admin here then?
<flutterloves> i love alicorns /)
<Mozdoc> Alicorns are essentially "gods", is that the assumption, since we've only seen four so far?
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Kimori> Noone really...
<donutpop365> That's true.
<Dark_Horst> four?
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Three.
<RedDragonX> nobody? lol it just fell out of the sky
<Kimori> its a bit of a long story
<Kimori> ill start from the beginning :)
<RedDragonX> ah
<Dark_Horst> yeah, i'd say i counted 3 too
<Phase4> huh, aparently theres going to be a live performance of 'gangnam style' in melbourne
<donutpop365> Luna, Cadence, Celestia, and do ya count uh the evil one.
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Wait, Chrysalis.
<MadSurge> donutpop365: alicorn OCs are frowned upon here :D
<donutpop365> Forgot her name.
<Everlasting_Joy> There's an alicorn in Twilight's "magic kindergarden" scene in S2E3.
<Wrek> 05nightmare moon
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Nvm, FOur.
<Kimori> Earlier this year, this place was still owned by Spryrocks
<donutpop365> There ya go, Chrysalis.
<Phase4> donutpop365, chrysalis?
<Wrek> 05OH adn my OC
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Same pony, Wrek :P
<Meanwhile> Nightmare is just Luna though, realistically.
<donutpop365> Wait really?
*Meanwhile kicks Wrek in the teeth.
<Dark_Horst> nightmare moon was just luna biting the nut
<Phase4> donutpop365, also technicaly a changling :P
<Kimori> But when he disappeared the channel will stay owned as long as he shows up here within 60 days
<weeping_pegasi82> Wrek: I think we'd all like to see you try and pilot a plane : )
<Dark_Horst> same pony.... kinda
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek does your OC get all da mane 6?
<donutpop365> Yea.
<Obsidian> Wrek: Liar, yours is an earth pony
<Meanwhile> I don't think Changelings count as far as Alicorns are concerned
<FillyFlam> I always saw Nightmare Moon as an eldritch abomination who just took over Luna's body, tbh.
<Meanwhile> Since they aren't really the same species.
<flutterloves> everyone whats your favorite episode?
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: how is it technically when she's the queen of changelings :P
<Kimori> Well he didnt show up for ages and the channel became unregistered
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> True.
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, i assume we were talking about alicorns
<Obsidian> DashWithRainbows: He would only want Twilight
<DashWithRainbows> I have no favourite, I hate them all <_< >_>
<Kimori> Pretty soon there were only three of us here in the channel, Me, Nightseas (hes not here right now), and prince-dari
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Comment was directed towards Meanwhile.
<MadSurge> FillyFlam: nah, it's Luna being evil.
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, chrysalist != pony
<Phase4> also i cant spell her name twice
<Kimori> Nightseas ended up registering the channel and he became owner, that was 3-4 months ago
<donutpop365> Python?
<Dark_Horst> FillyFlam: i think it was just a severe case of multiple personality disorder. emotional stress can do that
<donutpop365> Phase4: Python? :D
<Kimori> he also went inactive and the channel became unregistered again
<flutterloves> is dashwithrainbows and wrek the only people answering my questions?
<RedDragonX> Hmmmm Dari you sneaky bastard
<Kimori> without ChanServ here the place will lost its main topic
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> yes
<FillyFlam> Dark_Horst: Hmm. Alright then. I coulda sworn I read that somewhere, though.
<Kimori> lose*
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> I guess
<Phase4> donutpop365, o_O
<Meanwhile> Still, anyone who makes their OC an alicorn is being incredibly pretentious.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm not going to answer that.
<MadSurge> donutpop365: also, NEVER ask for ponies, as you're likely to get all generations except the current one :D
<DashWithRainbows> I don't answer questions, I raise them.
<weeping_pegasi82> or they just love alicorns
<Meanwhile> No.
<Kimori> there really wasnt anyone in charge
<Meanwhile> You don't get an excuse.
<Dark_Horst> FillyFlam: i tink faust commented on her da on that. but i completely forgot what it was
<Kimori> By then I decided to register it
<Meanwhile> You don't get a "Oh don't worry about it"
<Kimori> that was two weeks ago.
<Meanwhile> You are a tool and shall be regarded as such.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<RedDragonX> IC
<Adjeca> hi
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: only Lauren Faust is allowed to have an alicorn OC
<Kimori> Hey Adjeca
<Meanwhile> And if it's an Alicorn that's black and red I'm going to skip pleasantries and just cave your head in with bricks.
<flutterloves> do you have a facebook wrek?
<FillyFlam> Dark_Horst: Ah, yeah, right. I should look that up.
<donutpop365> flutterloves: Don't have a favorite episode really, too many.
<Adjeca> how goes you?
<donutpop365> Too many awesome ones that is.
<Kimori> You don't have to worry ReddragonX I'm not power hungry :P
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/232/img20120504154626.jpg/ this is what i work with, on a daily basis

<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: but black and red means cool and mysterious and slightly dangerous! isnt it totally cool?
<Meanwhile> Giant slinkies?

<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Dark_Horst: You're kidding ight?
<flutterloves> lol
<donutpop365> Derpy_Hooves: WOAH, macaroni!
<donutpop365> :P
<shibaru> According to Gen's mom, liking something that you don't like makes that person creepy 8)
<Kimori> I'm surprised nobodys placed a bid on that yet
<flutterloves> i dont like stalking
<twilight_sprinkle> i need to make a black/red alicorn with a trollface for a cutie mark
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: Not as much as it means "Teen angst"
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome|Hungry: you cant see it, by my sarcasm is showing
<Crystaline_Shard> what game?
<MadSurge> Derpy_Hooves: :O PIPES
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Dark_Horst: Oh, really? :P
<Derpy_Hooves> yes MadSurge
<Dark_Horst> YA, really!
<Spectrum_Rush> red and black means lack of imagination and no sense in colour combinations
<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> black red looks good on cloth.
<flutterloves> dat gunshot
<AJIsAwesome> I guess.
<Crystaline_Shard> :? WHAT GAME!
<twilight_sprinkle> black goes with almost anything
<Obsidian> Crystaline_Shard: Planetside 2
<weeping_pegasi82> planetside 2 sheesh
<Crystaline_Shard> Thank you Obsidian
<Obsidian> np
<Dark_Horst> put black and red on your car. put black and red on your jacket if you want. put black and red on a pony, you deserve to get your shit slapped back in order
<Meanwhile> Allicorn has really got it out for Wrek.
<Dark_Horst> put it on an alicorn adn listen to the crowd cock the shotguns
<twilight_sprinkle> ok im convinced. as soon as i get the time im making a black red alicorn with fangs and a trollface cutie mark
<flutterloves> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> isn't this game still in the alpha phase?
<DashWithRainbows> I want bullets for christmas.
<Obsidian> weeping_pegasi82: He got a code for the Beta
<donutpop365> Apparently beta.
<Dark_Horst> weeping_pegasi82:beta
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Don't forget the massive amounts of scars. That
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if they have dragon wing sof rponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fighting Pinkie Pie: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg607/scaled.php?server=607&filename=pvppinkiepie.png&res=landing
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd take a shotgun to be honest.
<weeping_pegasi82> oops my mistake
<flutterloves> how do you make a pony with the same animation from the show?
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: AND BATWINGS
<Meanwhile> You learn to draw.
<DashWithRainbows> Nittany_Discord dem bookmarks.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i'll be using the OC maker for bonus rage, idk if they have scars
<flutterloves> i meant online
<weeping_pegasi82> Battle on got into the pony action....
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: DO IT. :D
<Meanwhile> You learn to draw with a tablet.
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
<weeping_pegasi82> let's play it!
<flutterloves> :| f you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The game calls her Princess Pink Pie and not Pinkie Pie though.
<AJIsAwesome> flutterloves: There are ponymakers online. I highly recommend that you make one yourself thoguh.
<AJIsAwesome> *though
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: for binus rage, edit the scars on with paint
<donutpop365> Nittany_Discord: Hooray XKCD.
<flutterloves> where do you find one?
<cowvarkian> flutterloves: google
<AJIsAwesome> flutterloves: Just search for one.
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: for maximum rage, just recolor celestia. with paint
<Meanwhile> You learn to google.
<flutterloves> ok
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: lol thats a good idea
<donutpop365> Nittany_Discord: You're a gamer, or so it would seem from your bookmarks.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Also don't forget an incredibly stupid fanfic to go with your OC.
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: If you want to make it truly ragetastic try and make it look like you mean it.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: eh, gotta keep the balance of no effort/rage inducing, fanfic sounds like a lot of work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01donutpop365: I am.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Okay. :D
<Dark_Horst> past sins. there, i said it
<AJIsAwesome> That overrated fanfic?
<Dark_Horst> ...you could simply rip off past sins
<Dark_Horst> that would hit hard
<Saturn> 08,01the Portal 2 OST is EPIC on fancy shmancy reference monitor earphones
<MadSurge> donutpop365: he also hates EA for their terrible profit politics over videogames
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never read past sins
<Obsidian> Suddenly Saturn
<Meanwhile> Past Sins, was alright.
<AJIsAwesome> I hear it's highly overrated.
<DashWithRainbows> there is always another one Wrek.
<alexxm> same here twilight_sprinkle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't hate EA anymore. Got too cynical with them.
<Mozdoc> What do the icons in the lower right of the stream mean?
<Kandarihu> Saturn, the OST is just the icing on the cake
<shibaru> I made my mac and cheese wrong ;___;
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: the portal 2 ost is epic, period.:P
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: but... the cake is a lie
<Dark_Horst> past sins. the fic that got way more flak than it deserved. also way more love than it deserved
<MadSurge> Saturn: what about the jazz piece? :)
<donutpop365> Hey Wrek, what kinda system do ya have?
<Meanwhile> Mozdoc: from left to right, discrimination, rated for ages 3 and above, strong language, and violence.
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i prefer the Bach
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: *Looks at My Little Dashie*
<Dark_Horst> the fanfic that caused a way too large shitstorm that it should have
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: seems legit
<Dark_Horst> what AJIsAwesome said
<Meanwhile> Mozdoc: But they're just there for giggles, they don't actually correspond with content.
<Mozdoc> Wrek self rates his stream?
<Dark_Horst> also *than it should have
<Kandarihu> Saturn, okay. Bad analogy. The OST is only one component of an excellent game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did that with Activision as well. Not my proudest moment.
<MadSurge> Mozdoc: yes :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wrek is still doing planet side?
<CK|Ded> I think what happened is that my own rage for EA exploded to such a level that the universe felt the need to compensate, so it drained Nittany's away.
<AJIsAwesome> Cupcakes can go die in a fire. It's one of the HIGHEST overrated and stupid fanfics out there. There are much better gore fics out there besides Cupcakes.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is it true that EA tried to buyout valve?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes
<Cades> back
<Kandarihu> Mozdoc, I was doing some research on that. It's symbols from the PEGI rating system.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When did that happen?
<shibaru> front
<AJIsAwesome> A while ago, I think.
<Cades> XD
<MadSurge> Is it me or do matches in this game drag on for veeeery long?
<alexxm> probably some time this year
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: they never stop
<Obsidian> MadSurge: Big game
<thelonepony> i beleive it was a month ago
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt EA try to copy steam and it was utter crap?
<donutpop365> Is that musin ingame, or is he just overlaying some music?
<thelonepony> that was origin
<donutpop365> music*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Origin. I can't judge it based on the fact that I never used it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA would have been fine if they didn't try to be control freaks with Origin.
<alexxm> night guys
<donutpop365> Night.
<Obsidian> I tried it. Its crap.
<thelonepony> night alexxm
<AJIsAwesome> night alexxm :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Define controlfreaks
<twilight_sprinkle> bye alexxm
<Obsidian> Goodnight alexxm
<thelonepony> oh yah i'm back
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night alexxm.
<Kandarihu> From left to right, they stand for "Contains discriminatory content or promotes discrimination" "Suitable for users 3 and up" "Contains foul language" "Contains violence"
<AJIsAwesome> hi DerpyMuffins
<MadSurge> donutpop365: Wrek likes to bring in his own music
<thelonepony> hi DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Who is streaming?
<thelonepony> wrek
<Meanwhile> Wrek is
<donutpop365> Wrek.
<Obsidian> DerpyMuffins: Wrek
<Dark_Horst> yeah. the terms of agreement in EA origin basically said nothing else than "hey buddy, the anus of your ahrddrive now belongs to us. yours too"
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: and as you can see, there he is! :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Dark_Horst: Wait what
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam scans your HD as well. Also, EA changed that part of the EULA.
<DerpyMuffins> Man you look good for someone who smokes Wrek
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just disagree with EA's banning policies.
<Kurra> Hory shoot iz dat sum Sumica onscreen?
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: yes. looked like themeanest kind of spysoftware. they basically gave themselves the right to do whatever the fuck they want
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How bad are they Nittany?
<MadSurge> Kurra: nope, Wrek
<Meanwhile> Kurra: No that's Wrek.
<Obsidian> Kurra: Wrek
<Kurra> Nittany_Discord wait what does Steam scan on your HD??? D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think it does.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: it got changed in later versions, but of course nobody trusted them after the first version
<Kurra> Wrek is stylin' btw |v
<Meanwhile> Inb4 spy sappin' his sentry.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: i still dont
<MadSurge> Kurra: agreed, those sunglasses are smashing!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What determines how much lag is generated when you play online games? Your connection speed?
<Cades> and brb again :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SpadeMagnes[School]: It was to the point where bans from EA-run forums meant that you lost your Origin account. It was really due to EA tying accounts in. It was a bad move since forum bans carried draconian punishments now.
<donutpop365> This is your captain speaking lol.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Draconian?
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all :D
<donutpop365> If I heard that inflight...
<AJIsAwesome> hi FlutterMEDIC
<Obsidian> Hello FlutterMEDIC
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School]: look it up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think even now, forum bans means bans from MP.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: think he meant draconic. as is evil
<donutpop365> Is it okay to post an off topic image?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Game bans should be handed out by at least the game dev, not the publisher.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ok... only forum I ever browse is the WoW forum
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01donutpop365: As long as it's within the rules.
<donutpop365> Okay.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should say at most the game dev.
<donutpop365> Any of you XKCD fans?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Besides editing game settings is there a way to increase how much fps you get for online games?
<FlutterMEDIC> donutpop365: just post the pic
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: he means draconian, or of great severity
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek opened his map, and I started trying to zoom it out. =|
<Dark_Horst> donutpop365: whatsitnow?
<DerpyMuffins> Dont crash
<MadSurge> donutpop365: not me, but we post that too :D
<donutpop365> http://xkcd.com/1112/ Any of you seen him before? Hatguy.
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: well, my foreign language skill improved today
<SpadeMagnes[School]> my WoW tends to lag when there is ALOT of shit on my screen
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: and draconic means relating to dragons
<MadSurge> donutpop365: basically, it boils down to no porn and no gore.
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: yep. i had them dwapped around
<Dark_Horst> <+swapped
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sentry going up
<cow334> hello every one

<Obsidian> cow334: Wrek
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never under stand why Hollywood started the whole getting shot knocks you back
<cow334> Obsidian: What is wrek playing
<Barbetos|AtWork> How did that guy not see that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oblivious.
<Obsidian> cow334: Planetside 2
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School]: because it looks cool
<MadSurge> donutpop365: also, youtube links are fine, but they're not allowed during a stream.
<Shadi> :)
<FlutterMEDIC> Barbetos|AtWork: Tunnel-vision?
<cow334> Obsidian: oh
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Shadi
<Shadi> Hello!~
<Dark_Horst> it also DOES knock you back
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It defies the law of equal and opposite reaction
<AJIsAwesome> hi Shadi
<thelonepony> hu Shadi
<Bronysith> sonuvabitch
<Shadi> Wassap?
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School]: >.> what are they getting shot with?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats some crazy tunnel vision. Its kind of hard to miss a bright blue sheild found on that mounted turret.
<cowvarkian> which movie?
<cowvarkian> what's your prime example?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Highly intelligent shade of blue he is not.
<Kandarihu> cow334, you see that chilled-out guy in the upper-righthand corner who looks like Wrek's Desktop Pony? That's Wrek
<Dark_Horst> i lik thta rifle
<donutpop365> Okay then.
<FlutterMEDIC> Barbetos|AtWork: from my experiences in TF2, i've seen pyros be oblivious to HEAVIES
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Geh I don't remember, I just saw Mythbusters test it
<Dark_Horst> we shall call it flarple rifle
<Dark_Horst> it sound spretty
<cow334> Kandarihu: Really??
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School]: myth busters don't always do the science right
<Kandarihu> cow334, yeah
<Shadi> Wait,is this live-streaming?
<cow334> Kandarihu: I didnt no that lol he looks pretty chilled
<Barbetos|AtWork> ANd that guy, he seriously thought he could win?
<Obsidian> Shadi: Yes
<FlutterMEDIC> Shadi: live stream
<Shadi> Cool!~
<cow334> ill be right back
<Barbetos|AtWork> I guess I understand. I have been in that auto pilot mode before.
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, any of you guys live in Minnesota?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Brain off with w + m1 all the way
<Kandarihu> And I see he's gone New Conglomerate since the last wipe.
<donutpop365> FlutterMEDIC: Yus.
<Shadi> Crap.G2G. b back tomorrow,mebbe. :P
<donutpop365> FlutterMEDIC: Why?
<Dark_Horst> and i still think the flight physics in there dont look very flighty
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We should stream Kaizo Mario :P
<Dark_Horst> looks like the aircraft is moving on rails
<FlutterMEDIC> donutpop365: need to find more bronies in the state
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: I still think the flight physics look bvery in beta
<FlutterMEDIC> SpadeMagnes[School]: YESH
<cowvarkian> *very
<Crystaline_Shard> SpadeMagnes[School]: DO IT FILLY
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: then I guess I'm a slightly better noob pyro, I like to sneak with my Pyro :D
<donutpop365> FlutterMEDIC: Do you?
<donutpop365> Live that is.
<Crystaline_Shard> MadSurge: your doing it right,
<Bronysith> http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/270/e/1/flutterbattle___sketch_by_ziemniax-d5g2hgq.png
<FlutterMEDIC> donutpop365: i wouldn't of asked if i didnt live in Minnesota
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What is W + M4 or what ever it is?
<NOM> .__.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: DAT REFERENCE
<shibaru> Ganon's mom doesn't care that he's bi and according to Gen's mom, that's wrong
<FlutterMEDIC> SpadeMagnes[School]: W + M1 = Forward and FLAME with pyro
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: I get killed all the time, but hey, people are surprised to see me sometimes :D
<shibaru> And she won't tell me why that's wrong
<donutpop365> Woah, in beta and they're already selling ingame upgrades? What?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Fluttershy would never use a sword. She'd kill it with her terminal cuteness.
<Obsidian> Need to leave for thte moment. bbl everypony.
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: or stare it to death :D
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: the sword is the only thing that CAN kill a colossus man
<Everlasting_Joy> Later Obsidian.
<donutpop365> Ciao.
<FlutterMEDIC> Everlasting_Joy: I've even seen the Soldier from TF2 get Diabeetus from her.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Now that I think of it, why would she kill it?
<flutterloves> http://generalzoi.deviantart.com/art/Pony-Creator-Full-Version-254295904
<flutterloves> sorry

<AJIsAwesome> ohai Bronysith
<Buytoast> don't tell them one
<flutterloves> yeah
<Buytoast> it's a bad idea
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My parents decided to be dumbasses and go with a morgage group or something that turns out to have a very bad credit rating...they didn't bother to fucking thorughly check it
<Barbetos|AtWork> KoL A game about D and D and being constantly on a quest to be drunk.
<Barbetos|AtWork> <3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O

<Buytoast> so who is streaming this Planetwars game?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek
<MadSurge> Buytoast: Wreky is!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My parents are so god damn stupid sometimes...
<Buytoast> look on the bright side
<Buytoast> they could've been abusive alcoholics
<FlutterMEDIC> Buytoast: true dat
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We probably cant even get the money back, so we just fucking conned
<Barbetos|AtWork> Feels like a hot wing night.
<Barbetos|AtWork> awwww yeaaaah
<flutterloves> ok
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[School]: yeah, probably you did get conned
<String_Shredder> Okay, so, my band's bigges fan from Pirot, Serbia, sent me this message on skype: yo Ian,because you are so cool,you'il get shoutout in my new show so go see my new video. I feel like a role model

<cowvarkian> String_Shredder: what band?
<flutterloves> nvm
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well thats whathappens when my parents dont fucking thorugly check a morgage group before signing up with them
<Dovah> so i guess nobody can help me out with spanish homework? well how bout biology?
<Cades> try not to let it bother you
<String_Shredder> cowvarkian: You've probably never heard of us

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well this year's christmas is gonna suck...
<MadSurge> Panda: Webcam Wrek! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Everlasting_Joy: DOing a barrel roll in a liberator is best described as trying to fly an anvil upside down.
<FlutterMEDIC> SpadeMagnes[School]: watchu mean?
<Panda> MadSurge i know. i saw it 3 hours ago >.> i didnt think he was still streaming
<Panda> XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Barbetos|AtWork: :D Fair enough. I just couldn't resist the obvious, and too easy, joke.

<weeping_pegasi82> well they made all those games
<cowvarkian> weeping_pegasi82: isn't artix an anti brony?
<weeping_pegasi82> beats me
<Cades> shibaru, try thinking about how hilariously stupid her values and beliefs are, maybe that will help, idk
<Barbetos|AtWork> Aw. what a jerk
<Cades> That's what I would do
<donutpop365> Their ship looks fancy ^^ The one who killed Wrek that is.
<donutpop365> Did everyone just stop talking or is my client being weird?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Dark_Horst> he seems to enjoy this song. i cans ee why
<J_E_Smith71> There was a show for it in the 90s
<Thrackerzod> Hows everyone :3
<Dovah> This is perfect reading music!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Thrackerzod :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like less art of my OC in a maid outfit really.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'd like more art of Fluttershy with Mew Hair!

<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: I wonder why 6_9.
<Ponies47> i have to many pictures of my OC R63 >_<
<Moopy> the one in that pink mane there
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ._. i'm 12
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01While there isn't much art of my OC, there's more of him in a maid outfit than not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My fault really.
<DashWithRainbows> Maybe I should contribute to that Nittany_Discord.
<DashWithRainbows> How about a janitor uniform?
<DashWithRainbows> :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think the proportion is 60/40 give or take. I'll have to count.
<Ponies47> If I was good at art I would draw Nittany's OC
<AJIsAwesome> Come to think of it, I haven't seen any non-maid art made for Nittany_Discord's OC.
<Thrackerzod> You know whats fun getting minecraft to work on 10 computers that only have about a gig of ram for a LAN party
<AJIsAwesome> What?

<weeping_pegasi82> hey guys I'm looking for a good computer drawing program with tablet and stylus which one should I get?
<CrimsonPhoenix> SAI
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's what everyone use
<weeping_pegasi82> never heard of it
<cow334> well the only drawing pad i have use right now is bamboo so i cant really give you a pick weeping_pegasi82
<CrimsonPhoenix> Paint Tool Sai
<CrimsonPhoenix> weeping_pegasi82, how long have you been drawing?
<donutpop365> To make a stallion ya just make their snouts taller right?
<weeping_pegasi82> well I've loved drawing my whole life but I've only had 1 official class but I excell at cartoon characters
<cow334> CrimsonPhoenix: what was that program called i use just paint because i dont no any art programs
<Moopy> Hey wheres AdamTheDuck?
<Shizuka> 13they start switching things up in the final area, plus some stupidly painful mobs that i had to summon minion after minion to not die
<Shizuka> 13and just when you think you're done, turns out there's still like three bosses to go
<CrimsonPhoenix> weeping_pegasi82, you might need some time to get used to the tablet at first but I heard bamboo is good enough and cheap
<Mozdoc> This music isn't even with English lyrics is it? What nationality is it even?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also Paint Tool Sai, google it
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Another Wedding! Extra Sprinkles!
<weeping_pegasi82> and my older sister is a amazing artist and the teacher I had said it ran through the family so maybe give it a chance on the computer

<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Didn't seem that important to me.
<sub06905> i couldnt even affored the first ipad
<Freefall29> I must say. ocarina of time is soooo much more fun compared to the wii classic controller. don't know why
<Freefall29> on a real n64 controller
<cow334> wy dose ranbow blitz or guy look sad or depressed
<cow334> Freefall29: probaly cause it has all them buttons
<cow334> thats what i like about
<Everlasting_Joy> cow334: Have you ever sat down with others to discuss the rules to something? It's about as boring as it looks.
<J_E_Smith71> Freefall29: What about the Gamecube controller?
<cow334> Everlasting_Joy: ooooh thats what it means okay okay sorry
<donutpop365> Hey.
<Freefall29> J_E_Smith71: I don't have zelda classic collection, so I can't say
<sub06905> or playing the 3DS version
<donutpop365> Hey Hey Hey!
<Everlasting_Joy> cow334: To be honest, I have no idea as to what they're writing. I just said "the rules" figuring it.
<J_E_Smith71> Freefall29: Well the Gamecube controller works with the VC
<AJIsAwesome> What What What?
<donutpop365> Is there ponified version of that???
<Freefall29> sub06905: don't have a 3ds. I have oot for n64 and wii.
<AJIsAwesome> Of what?
<Prince_Lightboom> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4881/

<donutpop365> http://sony-mae.deviantart.com/art/Fat-Albert-and-the-Cosby-Colts-198143216
<sub06905> wut
<Freefall29> I guess because it was made for n64, it just feels more better to play on n64.
<Dovah> Dumb lag
<Freefall29> after playing skyward sword. I love navi so much more then I used to
<Everlasting_Joy> Dovah: For some reason, I read that in Sweetie Belle's voice.
<Dovah> Everlasting_Joy: Good
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: I don't care what anyone says, the Water Temples in all Zelda games are awful!
<Wahahaha> hello
<Ponies47> Hey Wahahaha
<Saturn> 08,01Everlasting_Joy: for some reason, I read *that* in Applebloom's voice
<AJIsAwesome> Love everything about Skyward Sword except main villain boss fights and Fi.
<Wahahaha> how's it going
<cow334> i swear Wrek looks like the guy from video game highschool i think his name was
<cow334> THE LAW
<sub06905> That poster is a spy!
<Freefall29> Everlasting_Joy: I've played zelda 1, no water temple... link to the past, the water temple was a lot of fun. you must be refering to oot's water temple.
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: What a twith (yes, in Twist's voice ;))!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03His chin looks like... mine o_o
<donutpop365> Sleepy?
<Ponies47> Dat Wrek with no sunglasses
<AJIsAwesome> You need sleep, Wrek. :D
<donutpop365> Looks quite nice!
<donutpop365> Yes, you do, you oughta sleep.
<Austin> woah, whats all this?
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: OoT, MM, TP, Oracle of Ages/Seasons, they all suck.
<DerpyMuffins> You look like you need some sleep Wrek
<Wrek> 05its not sleep i need
<Ponies47> Ummmm. Dat bone cracking O_O
<Freefall29> Everlasting_Joy: you talking about just the temples... not the game as a whole. correct
<sub06905> he needs his motor oil
<cow334> Wrek: you need some of them coffe
<cow334> or eat some pickes
<cow334> pickles
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: Yes, the water temples in those games are terrible.
<AJIsAwesome> He needs an E-Tank.
<donutpop365> Arabica or Robusta?
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: The games themselves are some of my most cherished video game memories.
<donutpop365> They say Arabica is better, but to be honest Robusta just sounds so much better.
<Freefall29> Everlasting_Joy: its been a while since I played TP, I don't remember the water temple there having any problems for me
<J_E_Smith71> Everlasting_Joy: The Water Temple's easier on the 3DS since the Iron Boots are a C-Button item, plus they added more direction stuff to make it easier to see where to go
<Dester> Wrek you looks like a sane Tom Cruise
<Dester> look*
<Austin> So, is this just outliing everything, or his he going for a cartooish look?
<Prince_Lightboom> this iz only pony drawing i made https://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/120/8/6/music_ponys_by_suirobo-d4y3jjz.png
<Prince_Lightboom> took so long :|
<Everlasting_Joy> J_E_Smith71: Fair enough. The only good that ever came out of any water temple was in OoT, Dark Link.
<Dester> well what ahppend to their glasses?
<twilight_sprinkle> Prince_Lightboom: thats quite good though
<AJIsAwesome> Not sure if that's yours.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: I suppose you're like me, only played TP once or twice.
<Austin> Prince_Lightboom: why are Rainbow's eyes red?
<Prince_Lightboom> i copied vinyls eyes and putted them there
<Dester> They are indigo
<Prince_Lightboom> srry i got a bit lazy
<Dester> i think
<Freefall29> Everlasting_Joy: man. I want midna to return, she's one of the reasons I love the game
<AJIsAwesome> Someone else did the same thing you did about a month ago and they just copied someone else's drawing and called it their own.
<Kimori> I need to go guys, see yous
<Austin> that's still pretty nice Prince_Lightboom
<Rustymeat> Who is streaming Wrek?
<donutpop365> Yes.
<Ponies47> Rustymeat: Yesh
<Everlasting_Joy> Freefall29: Agreed.
<Everlasting_Joy> Rustymeat: Yep

<CCCP> you found out that im actually on my PC Bronysith
<Nittany_Discord> You can buy Sparkle Gems for stuff, but you don't need them.

<Bronysith> CCCP: anyone with at least .00001% of a brain could figure out you were on the pc
<donutpop365> I like this channel.

<Bronysith> CCCP: no, snooki is still alive
<Spoonfulthought> Nittany_Discord: sounds pretty cool

<Cypresswolf|URU> While I'm at it - heard a good one about a janitor and some Jr High aged girls :) - This group of girls would put on make up in the morning, lipsitck included - they'd kiss the mirror leaving a lip imprint - this went on for about 2 weeks until the Janitor complained about how hard it was to clean their makeup off the mirror...
<Spoonfulthought> Cypresswolf|URU: eeww
<Spoonfulthought> them girls are nasty then
<Austin> Cypresswolf|URU: why would they do that?
<Spoonfulthought> kissing the restroom mirros
<Spoonfulthought> like seriously

<Ryunosuke> I am sorry, I cant seem to get over the fact that Wrek is going to Fly into the Danger Zone with those 80's aviator glasses :p
<Discord-Drocsid> hey hey hey

<Ryunosuke> just... 80's :p
<Everlasting_Joy> Cypresswolf|URU: Wow. . . And here I thought middle schoolers couldn't sink any lower.
<Cypresswolf|URU> The next morning the priciple gathered the girls up so the janitor could give a demonstration of how hard that make up was to clean - he turns around, picks up a squee-gee, dips in the toilet, and wipes the mirror :D
<LadyCanary> Ryunosuke: I was talking about the pony, silly XD
<Ryunosuke> oh :p
<LadyCanary> I didnt say you said he looked bad XDD

<Reikim> Dwarf Fortress has you managing seven psychotic, manic-depressive, retarded alcoholic midgets dropped in the middle of nowhere. If you're good, you get more. And then you try to keep them from killing themselves, being killed, or otherwise spiraling into insanity.
<Reikim> That's Dwarf Fortress.
<AJIsAwesome> ........sounds......interesting
<LadyCanary> <3 Dat candybar bumtaze
<Reikim> Anybody in Regs interested in Dwarf Fortress?

<LadyCanary> Wrek is best viking.
<Austin> i will amdit, it looks like skyrim
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Buytoast> its not like there's anythig non le arrow game related that looks like that in reality
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in what ?
<scout19_tf2> jammin
<Reikim> http://i.imgur.com/mHXiz.png
<Mist> Who's the badass dancing?
<Reikim> A strange little game.
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, really involved rts
<Austin> rock it wrek!
<Mist> WREK.
<Meanwhile> Wrek.gif
<Mist> OH LORD.
<Mist> Badass.
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: :D
<Reikim> Phase, you want in? We're doing a community fort.
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile make it happen
<Mist> Except, you are wearing sunglasses, indoors.
<LadyCanary> YES.
<Meanwhile> Implying I know how to do that.
<Austin> I used t be an artist like him. then i took an arrow to the knee
<Reikim> "We" being me, RX, and anyone else I can recruit.
<LadyCanary> ....
<Reikim> otakon's already signed up.
<LadyCanary> Canary cry? Canary cry time.
<Mist> WOW.
<Mist> SO MUCH BADASSERY.
<Phase4> Reikim, i could never wrap my head around the game
<Nittany_Discord> You don't need knees to draw.
<Reikim> Bah
<Mist> You should be laid, on a regular basis, Wrek.
<Reikim> It's not that hard once you learn the hotkeys.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I use to make pointless references to skyrim then I shot myself
<Cades> Everybody died :(
<scout19_tf2> if u only wear sunglasses outside u aint got swag
<Austin> Who says that?
<Buytoast> if only people would actually do that
<Phase4> thats the other issue, so many hotkeys
<Meanwhile> It has hotkeys?
<AJIsAwesome> SWAG needs to die.
<Reikim> Only about twenty, max.
<Reikim> Maybe more.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Austin> if someone says one more arrow to the knee joke, you got an ax to the head!
<ChangelingSlayer> *makes list to be a badass artist*
<LadyCanary> XDDDDD
<ASoftFluffyThing> ^^
<Phase4> XD
<LadyCanary> Wreky <3333
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm not a wow player i can't handle over 10 hotkeys
<Phase4> Reikim, its multiplayer?
<Everlasting_Joy> Go wrek! Go wrek! It's your birthday! It's your birthday!
<Reikim> In a fashion.
<LadyCanary> DANCE THE DANCE OF YOUR PEOPLE.
<Reikim> Ever read Boatmurdered?
<Phase4> define 'in a fashion'
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Viking-Pony-329387614?ga_submit=10%3A1348713705
<Phase4> nope
<Wrek> 05ENJOY

<LadyCanary> <3
<Reikim> Each player gets a year to play (ingame year, of course)

<cachi01|phone> Wrek Dem tf2 prints
<Reikim> At the one-year mark, you are required to save it, zip it, and send it to the next person in line.
<Phase4> Reikim, yeah, i'd probably screw it up, interesting concept though
<Reikim> The whole point is to screw it up.
<Reikim> That's the beauty of it!
<Buytoast> so ten bucks say that Sir Dragonherkers Land of Depravity will take this and lable it as skyrim
<Reikim> Some of the chaos from such forts is legendary.
<Phase4> XD
<cachi01|phone> Buytoast you mean EQD
<Buytoast> along with the other drooling masses that swarm it
<Reikim> Anyway, we do that, and at the same time, we write a narrative around the madness.
<Phase4> i'll give it a shot i supose
<crazypony> it looks great Wrek :)
<Reikim> Yay~
<Buytoast> Sir Dragonjerker's land of Depravity

<Mega_Milk> Fun Fact: All the characters in the ray-man series Speak in pig latin.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<p4ngya> piglatin?
<Mega_Milk> Instead of saying good job
<Mega_Milk> They say
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Isn't it only in this game?
<Mega_Milk> odd bog
<Mega_Milk> or ood bog
<Trollberries> Can I post picture links?
<Mega_Milk> Nope
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ood gay ob jay?
<Mega_Milk> They speak the same way throughout the entire series.
<Mega_Milk> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yup.
<Kimori> But anyways..
<Kimori> How are you?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What abot Rayman 3? Don't they speak normally?
<Mega_Milk> Nope
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hm.
<Mega_Milk> Pig latin :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<Mega_Milk> Of course you read it out normally but listen to there speech and you can actually make out there words.
<Sylandest> I remember playing Rayman 2: the great escape...loved that game
<Mega_Milk> Hodlum havoc was my favorite.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I could never get into Rayman as a kid.
<Sylandest> I wonder if they'll ever let it be downloadable for the Wii...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Then this game made me love it.
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: Its a sony production
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: Wait not the n64 -lol
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: I kinda doubt it.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sylandest: It was originally supposed to be downloadable, but then they changed it to purchase nly.
<Kimori> um hope I didnt gross you out
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Oh, wait. wrong game. :D
<Trollberries> I'm tripping on the song here....

<Cades> ouch :/
<Sylandest> Mega_Milk, AJIsAwesome|Busy: so with that said, Rayman 2: potential download for the wii?
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: Doubtfull.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hm....... I'm not sure.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Probably not.
<Sylandest> cuz I would love it if it was. I replayed it so much, I prolly broke the old cartridge :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I do know that Rayman 1 is downloadble via PSN.
<Kimori> It will heal though
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: You could always just install the Wii64 emulator on your wii and download the rayman 2 rom and pkay it that way.
<Kimori> so anyways...looks like its just us two again for tonight
<Kimori> Are you still awake Adjeca?
<Sylandest> Mega_Milk:...that went completely over my head. :$
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: You know what an emulator is right?
<Kimori> http://www.n-europe.com/news/latest-3ds-update-blocks-95-of-flash-cards
<Sylandest> Mega_Milk: I'm familiar with it...but I fear if you tried to explain now, it'd be useless. im heading off to bed. :$

<Tiberium126> MadSurge, OH you dont understand how they saw him. he was a god to them
<MadSurge> LightTrooper105: yes, but they followed his wishes even when they were suicides
<LightTrooper105> indeed
<MadSurge> Only the soldiers. Officers and generals had a slightly more human perception of him
<LightTrooper105> yup
<Tiberium126> History is History
<MadSurge> Also they could have easily wiped out the D-Day forces with their brand new tanks, but they required Adolf's authorization to do that and he was napping at the time :D
<Tiberium126> MadSurge, YER LOL
<LightTrooper105> and the assualt rifle was reject by Hitler at first

<MadSurge> I'm watching bad anime being riffed on
<Ryunosuke> Stabber fleet issue = Minmatar, Minmatar = Projectile turrets ( Autocannons and Artillery) this ... put Energy Turrets (a different race, which the Stabber Fleet has NO bonuses to) wasted said 70 billion isk on a fit that doesnt work :)
<Ryunosuke> let me dig up a linky
<Gold_Demona> What game is this?
<Ryunosuke> http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Stabber_Fleet_Issue --- Minmatar Cruiser Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret firing speed and 10% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret tracking speed per level.
<Ryunosuke> not only did this person put energy turrets on it, it put SMALL energy turrets, not even medium ones

<taoumi> xD oh pinkie
<taoumi> "i am goign to wear a box. and it's full pf posion lobsters"
<Gold_Demona> Is that better or worse than stuffing a bag full of crabs in your mouth?
<Phase4> http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/567389.jpg
<Gold_Demona> omg, I remember those things. XD
<Phase4> earlier today a gift code for a ti dev bord circled the internet, $200 board for $4
<Gold_Demona> Mine had tetris on it. :3
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, i want something as powerfull as the ti software but on a ds
<Gold_Demona> Well, it wasn't really mine. It was my husband's. (back when he was just my boyfriend)
<Phase4> it has 10 hours rechargable battery life and wont lag so much
<Gold_Demona> Programming stuff's all over my head, sadly. =/
<MadSurge> Better playing games than making them, eh?
<Gold_Demona> lol, I couldn't make a game if my life depended on it. XD
<taoumi> i have a phobia of needels. not lie geting poked wit hthem and what not. i am scared of them going in then breaking.
<Phase4> taoumi, odd phobia
<Gold_Demona> The closest I come to it is maybe some SUPER simple code modification if I stare at a code long enough to figure out what does what.
<taoumi> yeah. don't step on them
<Kandarihu> So, what game is this?
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't anyway. That shite hurts. =/
<Phase4> ever stepped on a thumbtack?
<MadSurge> taoumi: Well, needles are made of metal, so it takes quite a hit to break them inside someone's skin
<taoumi> um... actualy alot less then you think
<taoumi> needles are so hard that they are supper brittle
<taoumi> you can break one with less force then it takes to break a pencil wit hoen hand
<MadSurge> That said, I don't really like needles either. Nothing to be scared about though
<Moopy> Night everypony im off to bed its 6 over here i'll see you guys in the morning ok..........peace
<taoumi> nighty
<Moopy> eeyup
<Ryunosuke> hmm game looks interesting
<spitfirecolt> bye moopy
<Gold_Demona> Doctor needles are also hollow. So I imagine they'd be easier to break than a solid needle.
<Wrek> 05mornin
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Wrek
<taoumi> actualy they are harder to break
<Ryunosuke> morning wrek
<taoumi> because they are halllow
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Wrek
<Ryunosuke> what game is Caramel playing?
<MadSurge> taoumi: yeah, but to be a doctor you need a steady hand, so there's very little chance of that happening. It's just like a bee sting, and those are ridiculous :P
<taoumi> ever tryed to bend a pipe vs the same width of soild
<taoumi> much easyer to bend soild
<MadSurge> Hey Wrek! :)
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: Company Of Heroes

<Wrek> 05but yeah
<Wrek> 05no hard feelin's
<Kandarihu> Thanks. No hard feelings from me either
<Gold_Demona> Now we are a family again. :D
*AdamTheDuck puts away his hugging arms :<
<Wrek> 05my light sorry excuse for a beards is actualyl grabbable now :3
<Wrek> 05personal achivement x3
<killerpony7733> Wrek Yay? mines still extremely soft and everything but you can take it by a few fingers and yank it
<Wrek> 05probably beats mine :P
<Wrek> 05downside to being semi-blond
<Wrek> 05your chin hairs stay blond for quite a while
<killerpony7733> Wrek Maybe not sure tbh. Oh and i'm actually gold blond ish so yeah but i have enough to actually have it visible ish :D
<Gold_Demona> Would it be wrong of me to giggle at your man problems? :P
<Wrek> 05not really
<taoumi> hispanic jew. all the brown currly hair :/
<Wrek> 05im sure we'd giggle ourself silyl at menstruation anyways
<Gold_Demona> Yeah probably. XP
<Gold_Demona> omg, dah craaaaaamps! D:
<MadSurge> Egh, I only manage to get stubble on my face .__.
<MadSurge> I'm not a hairy guy
<Dark_Horst> i never saw the advantages of black hair until today
<Wrek> 05though apparently shaving ones face is about as sensitive as a mix of shaving genitalia and armpits (in terms of skin sensitivity) so the argumetn "we dotn know how it is" doesnt really fit that
<Gold_Demona> Having dark hair is a DISadvantage for me. Makes my leg hairs painfully visible after shaving. :<
<Wrek> 05based of the seterotype now though
<Wrek> 05not saying you said that
<Wrek> 05etc etc
<Wrek> 05disclaimers
<MadSurge> That must be because I have a semi-afro on my head :D
<Gold_Demona> half-fro ftw :D
<Dark_Horst> well another problem is, irregularities inbeard growth are also very visible
<Wrek> 05yay for being akward!
<Dark_Horst> THERE'S A HOLE IN MINE!
<Wrek> 05and yeah
<killerpony7733> Wrek Nah not awkward if you ask me it's good discussion material :P
<Wrek> 05i have a sligth scar on the center of my jaw
<Dark_Horst> if genetic history is any indicator, that will atch up when i'm 25
<Wrek> 05so not as beardy there as on the sides of said scar
<Gold_Demona> There's a spot on my husband's face that refuses to grow with the rest of his beard, so any time he goes without shaving for a while, it looks really weird.
<Wrek> 05so i kidn have an inverted hitler stache but on the otehr side of the mouth :|
<MadSurge> I'm curly, so long hair means big puff of hair :D think Pinkie-like hair
<Gold_Demona> Off-topic, I'm really diggin' this music. =)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Jmo> nemnemnem
<therainbowvortex> BYE EVERY PONY
<taoumi> this talk of pinkie hair makes me feal tempted to find a picture of my pinkie costume from dragoncon
<Dark_Horst> when i go without shaving, i just end up looking like a terrorist
<Gold_Demona> Jmoooo!
<taoumi> nighty
<Jmo> Gold_Demona~

<DoctoDoctorWho> dammit, is it on DA?
<Dark_Horst> tiberium... there was a c&c shooter planned to come out under that name
<Dark_Horst> and then they canned it
<Wrek> 05its jsut a sketch
<Dark_Horst> becasue they "couldnt meet the expectations"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: there is an fps for it
<taoumi> why did this show up when i was looking for "pinkie pie dragoncon 2012"
<taoumi> http://andy593.deviantart.com/art/Dragon-Con-2012-Pedobear-cosplay-325146899?q=gallery%3Aandy593%20randomize%3A1&qo=2
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: yes, renegade
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: be sure to watch at least one Disco-I mean, Q episode :D
<killerpony7733> Wrek Ah so you really didn't play after C&C 2?
<Wrek> 05i played all RAs
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: We've already past most of them. XD
<Wrek> 05played the 2 first C&Cs
<Wrek> 05pirated the 3rd
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I think we only have 1 Q episode left to watch
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: generals?
<Wrek> 05i got generals aswell
<killerpony7733> Wrek Ah makes sense.
<Wrek> 05i dont have zero hour though
<Millenium> CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS!!!!! Discord will come soon :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: in which series? Deep Space 9 or whatever it's called?
<Ninjazz> Hello everyone.
<Gold_Demona> Next Generation. DS9 only has 1 Q episode.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have the first decade and tiberium twilight
<Ninjazz> I see C&C Generals talk.
<Dark_Horst> i think we had deja-q already, didnt we?
<Gold_Demona> And the Q episode in DS9 is pretty uneventful, actually. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just him going for a golden egg, right?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I only got twilight so I could say I had it, the game itself sucks balls actually
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Mostly it's just him trying to convince whats-her-face not to leave him.
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, tiberian twilight.... that abomination
<Gold_Demona> In Next Generation, we've yet to get the the episode where whats-her-face goes with Q.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also, do you like Picard? :3
<Kandarihu> Heh, those parachutes looked like falling boulders
<Dark_Horst> rape of the franchise and a kick in the face for every c&c fan on the planet
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Picard is best captain. Sisco is most badass captain.
<Wrek> 05^^^^^^
<DoctoDoctorWho> I really want C&C 3 and kanes wrath
<Dark_Horst> cant get over cisco's weird way of talking
<Ryunosuke> TIME WARP
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: I could listen to Sisco talk all day. :3
<MadSurge> LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAAAIINNNN~
<Dark_Horst> Gold_Demona: it's probably becasue i gre up with the gemrna dub, he doesnt do that there
<Gold_Demona> LOL, I think of this song everytime time warp is activated in KSP. XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Above all else, I cant wait to use an epic unit
<DoctoDoctorWho> I've read so much about them:)
<Dark_Horst> mammoth mkII was most epic unit
<Gold_Demona> Dark_Horst: Yeah. I could see where it would be a little jarring, lol.
<DoctoDoctorWho> DaringDerpy: MARV still better tho...:)
<DaringDerpy> hm?
<DoctoDoctorWho> tab fail, sorry
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: MARV is way better than the mkII
<Tiberium126> oh that was fun
<Caramel> 2,14 you little fucker
<LightTrooper105> well that was close..
<Caramel> 2,14 denying me my revenge

<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: In the event that I come into ownership of a pc game that people are okay with streaming, and say, a mod is streaming that very same game, how would I go about playing a match with said mod?
<Caramel> 2,14 uh...
<Crystaline_Shard> Racing them and reporting your progress every 6 minutes.
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Caramel> 2,14 you ask if they want to play with you...?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: that simple?
<Caramel> 2,14 pretty much
<killerpony7733> DoctoDoctorWho Well for example i played tribes ascend with wrek quite a bit back in the summer and we owned the score boards in most matches so yes if they want you can ask
<Caramel> 2,14 though I'm going to say this now

<Millenium> My favorite song ever!
<flutterchu> HUH?
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, at that point it would be AMV
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, whoever made this video is making the same mistake
<Millenium> I love it!
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: it's "Here comes the sun" :D
<Gold_Demona> The G2 toys came out AFTER this cartoon. This is still G1
<Millenium> :'(
<Caramel> 2,14 and this is G1
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, I should've guessed :D
<Millenium> NOOOOOO
<doughnutjoe> legend has it if you type "Sea ponies" 5 times in chat the mods will be forced to play it. But it's only a legend so....
<Millenium> Why!!!!
<Crystaline_Shard> G1 had megan G2 was trying to get the now teenagers who used to watch the show back watching it focused around school and boys and shit.
<flutterchu> cant tell the diffrence
<CrimsonPhoenix> >not showing seaponies for G1
<Ponies47> Thank God moopy isn't here right now. He would be bitching away as always about the other G's -_-

<Caramel> 2,14 there, now you can tell the difference
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, that's G1.5
<flutterchu> ahh the pilot episode of gen 1
<Crystaline_Shard> G3 was the direct to video stuff.
<flutterchu> the ponies that started it all
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, there was also a computer game
<MadSurge> Caramel: teach these foolish ignorants
<Caramel> 2,14 so now when I troll you with newborn cuties, I expect to see "Oh god not G3.6!"
<Crystaline_Shard> G4 is FIM duh.
<doughnutjoe> anyone else remember the gmod video that had this song in it?
<Gold_Demona> the G2 toys hadn't started yet when Pony Tales came out
<ofna02> we need some g4
<Millenium> Look ppl, its the origional rarity!
<Gold_Demona> It was still G1
<MadSurge> Caramel: now go back to rainbow sex :D
