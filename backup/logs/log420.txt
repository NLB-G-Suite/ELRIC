He finds out that the spell will be permanent if he stays like it too long while going out with Rarity under a different name. rarity finds out and convinces him to change back bc she loves him for who he is. Moral: Be true to yourself.

<cachi01> there should be a new internet rule if it exist there is a pony version of it
<CupcakeWarrior> So whats happening tomorrow since there isnt an episode?
<SteveCharb> Ryanier128: why not just double the x chromosome?

<Aylnine> 'Allo
<Ryanier128> SteveCharb how would he double it without proper equipment? We can't even do it ourselves
<otakon> Ryanier128: I think that is incorrect. Males are X/Y right? WOmen are Y/Y so I figure just replicate teh Y since Men USED to be women right?
*fapplebloom wonders what the filly eyes are
<Litwick> Everypony type the word "the" if you want to initiate WMC for Aguille.

<derpy_pony> moralfag
<Light_Latias> 12I must disagree somewhat
<otakon> Spike convinces Twi to turn him into a pony so he can go out with Rarity. He finds out that the spell will be permanent if he stays like it too long while going out with Rarity under a different name. rarity finds out and convinces him to change back bc she loves him for who he is. Moral: Be true to yourself.
<TwiilightSparkle> Well, no friendship reports for 6 MONTHS O.O

<UnFoundBug> Sumica, omg
<Reikim> Have I mentioned that this anime helped me out of near-depression? Because it totally did.
<Umbreon> wasn't it originally for the gamecube?

<UnFoundBug> that is amazing
<drf|osx> The Legend of Link's Distractions, that's all
<YOitzGEEZUS> umm
<FlyingShoppingCart> wait... what?
<Brony87> Hatsune Miku is awesome
<pony_3604> this is cool music
*TwiilightSparkle wears those glasses
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it's also been around for over 20 years and is STILL considered one of the best manga and anime franchises. it also inspired friggin Naruto and it's asstons of filler.
<drf|osx> I *tried* TP legitimately
<Light_Latias> 12it was released for both at the same time, Umbre
<drf|osx> gave up after a day
<MakerDusk> lol, I loved that anime!

<Umbreon> oh
<Umbreon> sorry
<drf|osx> ALTTP was actually decent

<Light_Latias> 12those weren';t side quests
<drf|osx> what is that a tutorial for, stuff that has nothing to do with the game?
<MakerDusk> (as I turn the steam back on)
<Darf14> Twilight as Kamina......seems legit
<Jewel> DBZ is a classic at this point
<CupcakeWarrior> Fun fact: It should technically take that battle billions of years because of how slow a being light years tall could possibly move
<Brony87> RAINBOOMED
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: let's see if Naruto stands up to the test of time that DBZ has. Also, One Piece.
<Light_Latias> 12that was the tutorial
<Reikim> otakon: TTGL is still the best. No exceptions.

<Mylilpwny> imma see these guys this summer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I use Rainbow Dash as a watermark when I stream.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: therefore, if DBZ is STILL BEING SHOWN 20 years later and has come out numerous times then it is considered classic at this point.

<Tovler|depressed> a shame that I'm only watching 2 animes this spring *looks for more new shows*
<Dances_With_Discord> Ponies the Guiles theme of tv shows
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I still contend however that TTGL is one of the most over the top awe inspiring manly tears anime ever.
<LunaTheBeloved> emangamer, what time is it for you?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: you can like it if you want, just dont make judgements about quality about something youre so biased about.

<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i mean animes shuldnt do fan service
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: there is fanservice but it's pretty well just tongue in cheek stuff in TTGL. Plus it's gainax, fanservice is almost guaranteed for anything they make.

<TheRainbowDash> UnFoundBug: Now Saturn got another reason to stay here....:D
<Saturn> 08,01Krakass: squee
<Jewel> Arguably, Japan probably things America loves teenagers traveling around the country solving mysteries, since that is all the 70s TV shows seemed to be about
<otakon> however,I find the characters very uninteresting
<Saturn> 08,01but i need to go to beeeeehehehed
<Shamroc> otakon...i cant make that observation from just the opening... lol

<Krakass> Goodnight then Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01UnFoundBug: squee
<Kandarihu> Jewel: I've been into anime deeply and long enough to know that's not true. But I generally prefer their stuff over American stuff. Naturally, I make an exception for ponies.
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: needs moar Discord
<otakon> Shamroc: just like the Teens React in retrospect
<TheHoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: SURE why the hell not?

<LunaTheBeloved> Bed time methinks....
<Shamroc> LunaTheBeloved: wait where was that?

<Chimera> hihi
<Umbreon> Silent Hill is too creepy
<drf|osx> junh1024-XD I looked under Dock, there's no setting about bouncing icons
<Umbreon> hi jacktheripper
<Jewel> I have to ask. Does the mechas add anything to this anime? Since I remember lots of talking when I ever saw an episode, well part of one, i got board
*Light_Latias shivers
<drf|osx> I have "animate icons" unchecked...
<Light_Latias> 12I knocked on this door

<Krakass> He couldn't guess it. Turns out I had chose the wrong word. I was supposed to draw Nemo.
<TheRandomkid321> AWW SH^T AUSTRALIA
<TheRainbowDash> Alister: That is possible.:P
<otakon> ValtheJean: I never was able to get into this show, if only becuase they explain NOTHING in the first episode and bombard you with new terms that you have to guess to.
<Light_Latias> 12suddently, there was a loud bang
<Kipkat07_Mare> headshot
<DeathStar> Alister: it's possible
<Light_Latias> 12I jumped
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: that first one:D
<Umbreon> generally not a good thing :P
<junh1024-XD> you might nd2 log out or sth

<FlareChaser> Alister: Shut..the..fuck...up.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Otakon: that's unfortunate
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because that's the point of the show
*DeathStar dances
<Alister> Possible in theory , but in a real scenario : I would take my wooden machete and bash his brain out !
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's about Renton growing up and understanding his world
<otakon> ValtheJean: plus, I don't like those little brats. They need a good beating
<That_Irish_Guy> TheRainbowDash http://mlpfriendshipismagic.deviantart.com/gallery/?set=30892837&offset=1176#/d4qqzw7 :3 May I???????

<TheHoodyNinja> TheRandomkid321: That is one weird thought
<Umbreon> let's be clear
<otakon> TheRandomkid321: they would be tough and stringy
<drf|osx> or rather, has a "do not enter' style sign where an icon shoudl be
<Umbreon> is that really steam
<Umbreon> or is it x-chat?
*Umbreon hides
<Jewel> Who are these people and why do they care about Death Clock?
<drf|osx> it's Steam
<Petrified_Discord> Is that guy's job just to shoot down the council's warnings?
*TheRandomkid321 grabs hunting rifle
<TheHoodyNinja> Dashie_Dashie: What, you got a problem with dancing?
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: dose it involve dance because I could help with that
<FlareChaser> Alister: Who the fuck said I had a toothbrush? I have a fucking gravity gun.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alister: Leave FlareChaser alone.
<TheRainbowDash> Why are we talking about how wings taste?:P
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Dashie_Dashie> it was about that
<Alister> @Nitanny_Discord : we're joking !
<otakon> Jewel: bc DethKlok music is SO influential on the world it affects the globes economy
<FlareChaser> Wat
<Kandarihu> They are the Tribunal, and they are trying to stop Deathklok from causing the Metalocalypse, which is an apocalypse of heavy metal.

<drf|osx> and it's weird because I have it open, too
<UnFoundBug> whut
*DeathStar dances

<TheRainbowDash> TheRandomkid321: Umm, I'm good for today....*flies away*
<MahBoi777> hey dentidiot!
<otakon> ValtheJean: I watched it on Adult Swim for a week, it did NOT show me what LFO means, or even set up WHY the world is like how it is really. I was left with tons of unaswered questions really.
<dentidiot> 0_0 wat is this?
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: just make sure it can hold a dancing deathstar
<Alister> -_- 2012 : Can't even make jokes anymore

I know it's a character driven series but I feel the cast of main characters is so large that I can't really focus on liking anyone really. I found Renton a whiny little kid myself, I felt like he had little character growth or at least rEALLY slow character growth. But that's just me, I don't think it's a bad show it's just...........slow I thi

<Sumica> 00,10Remastered bebop dvd's ftw
<Jaketehsnake> Yep, somewhere around September 2011 for me. A few weeks after my brithday, 8/29
<Polydunami> I was skeptical
<ACS13123> Dis
<ACS13123> wut?
<Jaketehsnake> MahBoi777, Thems the days
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<GabeMoist> I started watching MLP a little over a year ago, but didn't get into it until a few days before Best Night Ever aired
<Sumica> 00,10I have streamed alot havent i
<Ninjazz> I watched the show around December but became a brony around the beginning of March
<Kencolt> We tend to have many diverse interests. Muchlike the US Special FOrces, except not as many guns.
<richfiles_tablet> I first saw Pony reaction images in the 13000+ post sticky on /b/ "Japan Sinks in Ocean: Wat do?" I had not been on /b/ before then while ponies existed.
<Mutterguy> richfiles_tablet, that earthquake happened just after Christchurchs everyone there( seeing as I'm breifly in melbourne) reaction was 'feel for ya Bro'
<FaithHeart> I like that we all have the same passion for ponies, but we also have our own interests
<Ninjazz> ^
<Polydunami> Indeed
<Jackjone> i become a brony i'd say in early march
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like sim speak
<FaithHeart> I know of an actual bro
<FaithHeart> who is a brony
<Jackjone> this year
<FaithHeart> like, he's really into sports, frat dude
<Ninjazz> I'm the only brony I know irl.
<Spectrum_Rush> i think i became a brony right after lesson Zero aired, started by seeing those short clips from Kyrospawn and the like
<richfiles_tablet> Eeyup. I wanted to see what the "asshole of the internet" was reacting like to the Japan disaster. Saw all those wonderful ponies, and had to learn more.
<Jaketehsnake> I remember seeing Ponies on /b/ and thinking nothing of it, calling straight up faggotry. A few weeks later, A friend (total /b/tard) forced me to watch the 1st episode, and I was hooked.
<Polydunami> I know about one or two bronies myself
<pony_943828> norht carolina
<FaithHeart> I know a couple
<Mutterguy> Pretty much in the middle of season one for me
<FaithHeart> but none are as into it
<Ninjazz> And I was a hater.
<Polydunami> Actually, she was a brony before I
<Polydunami> My friend
<Ninjazz> Man, that has to be the 15th time I said that.
<MahBoi777> I didn't hate the show or anyone that watched it at first
<Jaketehsnake> Well, it is rather late, and I have to sleep for more awesome time tomorrow. Night all. Also, we forgive you for being a hater and one point Ninjazz.
<Ninjazz> Oh. I hated it. HATED IT!
<Shamroc> RUSSIAN MAN!
<richfiles_tablet> I avoid /b/, but I am well aware of it. It shocked me to see people persisting in this love and tollerance thing, depite the persecution. It was BEAUTIFUL! :)

<Kencolt> To be honest, to some small extent, Love and Tolerance started out as a sort of a troll. Noting bugs a hater so much as somepont who refuses to return the hate.
<ACS13123> LOLWUT?
<FaithHeart> good night!
<Ninjazz> Jackjone: Yes. Just a little.
<Ninjazz> FaithHeart, you leaving?
<FaithHeart> I'm going to have to head out. I got a luncheon to attend in the afternoon
<Ninjazz> Alright, Cya FaithHeart.
<FaithHeart> it's for my mom's friend's grandaughter's holy communiion
<richfiles_tablet> I saw trolling, and I saw gnuine L&T. The fact that it was on /b/ amazed me! :)
<RainBowJack> aaahh Faithheart
<Shamroc> dat failure
<FaithHeart> I'll be back for Euro movie night
<Spectrum_Rush> Crackle?
<halotheme> da faq
<ACS13123> ...
<Digitalis> HAHA
<FaithHeart> if the chat is still going on
<Ninjazz> Ewww.
<ACS13123> wtf?
<Shamroc> creepy
<RX-78-SweetieBot> So who all is ready for the first saturday without new ponies?
<MahBoi777> bye FaithHeart! come back later!
<FaithHeart> I will :)
<Sumica> 00,10chat is almost always going
<Spectrum_Rush> bai FaithHeart
<FaithHeart> Pinkie Promise
<RAWRity> In order I watched "Haiyore! Nyaruko-San", "Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine" "Mysterious Girlfriend X" "Polar Bear's Cafe" "Accel World" "Kids on the Slope" and "Eureka 7 Ao Astral Ocean"
<Ninjazz> RX-78-SweetieBot: I ain't. :(
<Polydunami> RX-78-SweetieBot: We've had ponyless Saturdays before
<Kencolt> Oh, FUUUUU--
<FaithHeart> :D
<Shamroc> derp
<Mutterguy> oh oh
<Ninjazz> RAWRity: Dat Lupin III
<FaithHeart> :P
<Polydunami> Oh yeah. See you later FaithHeart :)
<FaithHeart> :D
<ACS13123> knifes are fun
<ACS13123> use a dead ringer
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 gringo
<richfiles_tablet> I think a lot of people still think it's a form of trolling. For me it's not. I've noticed that L&T has faltered as non /b/ and /co/ people came in as the fandom grew. A lot of us take it seriously.
<Jackjone> stabby stabby
<Sumica> 00,10So more or less every new anime this spring RAWRity
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Polydunami: but this is the begining of a drought
<YamaTHou> is it just me or the stream is kinda laggy?
<FaithHeart> good night everyone! Thank you for making me feel so welcome here :)
<Jackjone> not on my end
<richfiles_tablet> Drought??? HAHAHAHA! :D
<Polydunami> True... but we still have ponies on youtube
<Spectrum_Rush> YamaTHou: hit the refresh on the bottom
<RAWRity> "Haiyore! Nyaruko-San" was about Cthullhu taking the form of a moe school girl coming to earth to protect our entertainment industry from space demons, all while making Kamen Rider references.
<Ninjazz> YamaTHou: Use the refresh button beneath the video stream.
<ACS13123> boom
<RAWRity> It was pretty meh.
<Ninjazz> Sounds like Japanese anime.
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, wait, what?
<Polydunami> Understandable
*RainBowJack is watching season 2 episode 25-26 " i just love the songs in there '
<MahBoi777> great songs
<Shamroc> DOG!

<Polydunami> Wait, This Day Aria. My bad :$
<ACS13123> This day aria
*Spectrum_Rush this day aria must of listened to it bout a hundred times now god i cant get enough
<Sumica> 00,10not seeing any lag but the frame rate seems low
<RAWRity> "Lupin III" was pretty cool. I never watched much of the original, but it was a fun episode, and the animation's buy the director of "Redline" so it looked fantastic.
*Polydunami did that on purpose ;)
<richfiles_tablet> I LOVE Lupin III
<richfiles_tablet> <3
<Ninjazz> The delay tonight is so low! I'm surprised.
<Ninjazz> Mica
<Tovler|depressed> someone said Lupin III?
<MahBoi777> LOL I like Oreos
<Ninjazz> SO freakin short!
<ACS13123> ...
<ACS13123> OH MY!
<MahBoi777> oh myyyyyy
<RAWRity> "Mysterioius Girlfriend X" was about a guy falling in love with a girl after becoming addicted to her saliva. It was surprisingly intriguing. Bizarre, but very interesting.
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Jackjone> scared the shit outta me O.o
<Sumica> 00,10so you all want to see the first ep of the new lupin III then?
<Ninjazz> YES

<Ninjazz> Ehhh. I like subs better anyway.

<Mutterguy> derpy cross eyed cat
<Ninjazz> Mew.
<Spectrum_Rush> -_(\
<RAWRity> Tovler|depressed: yeah, just watche dthe first ep... Not sure what to say, but i'm curious to see where it goes.
<Polydunami> Oh yeah. Polydunami is okay with subtitles
<Polydunami> Do Ano Hana one day
<Jackjone> meow
<Shamroc> OMG
<Sumica> 00,10I have your cat on my head, your argument is invaled
<richfiles_tablet> Subtitles are fine... When one is not chatting! :$
<ACS13123> o.o
<Spectrum_Rush> so is this person a dude or a dudette the voice confuses me
<Ninjazz> Dat METAL
<Polydunami> I understand
<Jackjone> dudette
<Jackjone> i think
<ACS13123> [[['[;[;
<Polydunami> Spectrum_Rush: You'll find out
<RAWRity> "Polar Bear's Cafe" was okay. Cute, but pretty slow, and not really something I'd be interested in watching. The entire joke is taht a polar bear and a panda bear own a cafe in the human world.
<ACS13123> []
<Sumica> 00,10blond is a woman
<ACS13123> [][]
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: oh lawd
<ACS13123> [.][.]
<Mylilpwny> \m/
<ACS13123> I was wreked XD
<Shamroc> soo who wants to try and guess VT's name
<Mutterguy> I assumed blond was a gay guy
<Tovler|depressed> I got bored of Polar Bear cafe fast, but its still light and enjoyable.
<Ninjazz> The anime this season doesn't seem like anything I'd really be interested in.
<Polydunami> ACS13123: You got Mica'd
<RAWRity> "Accel World" is really neat. THink .Hack// meets Gurren Lagann
<ACS13123> OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY
<Jackjone> me either the anime is ok ok
<richfiles_tablet> I'd guess... But I have maybe seen this episode a dozen time, so I shall... OH MY
<Jackjone> this season
<Sumica> 00,10got that one too RAWRity
<Ninjazz> Sounds good.
<Tovler|depressed> Medaka Box… I'm only watching it because its 50+ episodes. Maybe it'll pick up.
<Polydunami> I haven't watched any anime lately outside of in here
<Spectrum_Rush> dem space truckers
<MakerDusk> Sumica: you aren't running the latest script: 5 messages in 10s == kick
<MakerDusk> :p
<MakerDusk> just sayin'
<ACS13123> yay :(
<Polydunami> Wrek switched to six
<Polydunami> Again
<richfiles_tablet> Thought it was 6 messages?
<RAWRity> Kids on the Slope seems alright. But not really my thing. It's about 2 guys apparently becoming jazz musicaions, and it's gotten a lot of praise amongst reviewers, but it's not to my tastes I suppose.
<Ninjazz> Good...
<Mutterguy> oooh like's we got us aconvoy
<Ninjazz> Dat Jazz
<Sumica> 00,10eh, what's that MakerDusk?
<MakerDusk> richfiles_tablet: unlimited for me :p
<Tovler|depressed> I need to check out Jormungand.
<GabeMoist> We got a mighty convoy rockin through the night
<richfiles_tablet> CONNNNNNNVOOOOOY
<MakerDusk> Sumica: wasn't this week's standard 5 messages in 10s?
<Jackjone> new season of Kore wa zombie desu ka is good
<Polydunami> dat jazzy chase music :3
<ACS13123> y\y
<Sumica> 00,10that's just wrek
<ACS13123> yay*
<Tovler|depressed> So far, the only anime that I can't wait to watch every week is Lupin III.
<RAWRity> Eureka 7 Ao Astal Ocean was...well, I think ti would make a lot more sense if I'd watched Eureka 7. It's very, very pretty though.
<Polydunami> I thought Wrek switched back to the six script?
<ACS13123> lolololo
<Sumica> 00,10he might have
<Ninjazz> I didn't like Eureka 7... It was boring to me.
<richfiles_tablet> I hear there is a new Eureka 7. Hope it was good! :)
<MakerDusk> the other way was more interesting
<Sumica> 00,10and the new eurika 7 is't the same story line just same universe
<MakerDusk> even Dari got kicked for it XD
<richfiles_tablet> I bought the HORSE MAURE out of that. First release box sets and everything@!!!@3223one
<MakerDusk> Sumica: there's a new Eurika 7?
<Sumica> 00,10that was cause no one gave wrek the version that had exceptions
<Tovler|depressed> Although Mysterious Girlfriend X enchanted me so much that I ended up reading the manga.
<Polydunami> I'm only reading manga latelyt
<MakerDusk> are you shitting me?
<Polydunami> *lately
<Sumica> 00,10yeah there is
<RAWRity> Sumica: I know, but I get the feeling there's a lot of stuff I'm missing for not having watched the original
<ACS13123> no fluttershy
<ACS13123> not yay
<MakerDusk> Sumica: seriously?
<ACS13123> NOT YAY
*Midnight_Tempest drinks gasoline and lights himself on fire.
<Sumica> 00,10Val already called that one so i cant help you there
<ACS13123> yay
<MakerDusk> well, there goes my free time XD
<Jackjone> AMERICA
<halotheme> yay
<Sumica> 00,10and yes MakerDusk
<Tovler|depressed> >mfw I didn't know there was a new Eureka 7 until now.
<RAWRity> MakerDusk: yep, Eureka 7 Ao Astral Ocean
<Sumica> 00,10it just started this spring anime seasion
<ACS13123> ...
<halotheme> dat face
<Mutterguy> Midnight_Tempest! the reason for the buckets and the brooms
<richfiles_tablet> Finding Eureka 7 online was what prompted me to kill cable for 3 years. :)
<RAWRity> unfortunately it's only available through Fansubs right now.
<Polydunami> I used to watch One Piece regularly and I picked the manga up
<Polydunami> Now it's only the manga
<Midnight_Tempest> Mutterguy: yup... I MAKE ALL THE MESSES!
<MakerDusk> must download new anime...
<ACS13123> ...
<MakerDusk> ...Eureka 7 was my first
<Sumica> 00,10Honistly unless it's [GG] I prefer fan subs
<DeadpoolDash> watch Black Lagoon...
<ACS13123> not yay....
<Spectrum_Rush> it always gets worse
<Polydunami> Dude, Black Lagoon is awesome
<Sumica> 00,10[gg] can sit and spin on it
<RainBowJack> Fruits Basket is AWESUME!!!

*Mutterguy gives Midnight_Tempest a hug in a water soaked dressing gown to avoid combustion
<richfiles_tablet> I was BLOWN AWAY when I discovered Hulu+ has Captain Harlock!!! :O :)
<Kencolt> Heh. My first anime was the NBC broadcasts of Astro Boy back in the 60's.
<RAWRity> So yeah, there's 3 new anime I plan on following, at least for a bit: Accel World, Lupin III, and Mysterious Girlfriend X. I might check out Jormungand too, since the premise sounds neat.
<richfiles_tablet> The subbed Japansese version even!
<Sumica> 00,10Macross was the first i ever saw
<Polydunami> You know what's online? The Tick (Live-action)
*Midnight_Tempest hugs Mutterguy back and gives him the look from Jurassic Park. 'Clever girl...'
<Mutterguy> Sailor moon or Samuri pizzacats. Unless Transformers count
<RAWRity> also, the part of me with morbid curiosity wants to look up Upotte!! just to see how bod it can get.
<RAWRity> *bad
<Polydunami> RAWRity: My morbid curiosity leads me to Seikon no Qwaser and that's all I have to say about that
<Polydunami> I mean it
<RainBowJack> RAWRity that anime is so FUNNY
<Shamroc> dat space
<YamaTHou> w8 what??

<Jackjone> me gusta
<Tovler|depressed> oh look. Episode 4 of Korra is out.
<Petrified_Discord> RAWRity: Someone showed me that...it was...yeah :/
<Ninjazz> Dear lord...
<Polydunami> You'd think that's not the point of Seikon no Qwaser
<RAWRity> how could I NOT watch an episode of that?

<Ninjazz> They really did work on her nether regions...
<Tovler|elated> plus Jigen Daisuke is badass in this iteration.

<RAWRity> Tovler|elated: never air it
<Evil_Spike> Wow, this is awesome
<MadSurge> So who's next, Goemon? :D
<Spectrum_Rush> bai Jackbone
<Tovler|elated> Goemon is the shit.
<Kencolt> 4Kids would not TOUCH this show with a ten foot Lithuanian.
<YamaTHou> I kinda like this...
*StartSwirlTheBearded Wiggles Eyebrows
<Evil_Spike> It's apparently the newest incarnation of Lupin the 3rd
<Sumica> 00,10guss I better pick up more eps for fridays
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats Goemon?
<Spectrum_Rush> Jackjone*
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine
<Polydunami> 4kids wouldn't go near this because, you know, not for kids?
<Ninjazz> This is something Adult Swim MIGHT show, if they censor a hell lot of it.
<Evil_Spike> They went near One Piece though
<Polydunami> One Piece was for kids, though
<RainBowJack> Lupin III is a lil mature content
<Polydunami> Well, older kids but still
<Spectrum_Rush> considering they showed the old one Ninjazz
<RAWRity> Evil_Spike: One Piece's art style made them think it was for kids.
<RX-78|FireEmblem> Ninjazz: if it stays in a time slot later than midnight, they dont have to censor too much
<Tovler|elated> they didn't even know what One Piece was when they aquired it
<YamaTHou> so what's next?
<Spectrum_Rush> or was that toonami?
<YamaTHou> more lupin?
<Ninjazz> RX-78|FireEmblem: True.
<Fattonie> I'd be happy if they just brought the old back
<Polydunami> Whoa
<Ninjazz> LALALALALALLALALALLALALALLALALALAL
<RAWRity> they quickly found out no, it's for teens, what with all the violence.
