<FlutterMEDIC> RainbowDashie: maybe
<RaveBrony> Not remake
<RainbowDerpy> why
<prince-dari> Really? :P
<Kjakings> 7stop saying that it means nothing.
<RaveBrony> Todays censors would ruin the show...
<CCharmanderK> DERPY
<Panda> Animaniacs was perfect with all of its innuendos that bypassed 90's censorship.
<RainbowDerpy> good point
<RaveBrony> It wouldnt be as open as it once was :(
<RainbowDerpy> GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY
<RaveBrony> ^
<CCharmanderK> Yes, 90s censors were the best because they never actually gave two shits about what shows that they let past.
<RainbowDerpy> rave that was amazing sexual innuendo
<trixie_squirtle> bye RainbowDerpy and RaveBrony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye RainbowDerpy :)

<Stormy> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that "it doesn't work" means "I'm too impatient to wait so I'm going to make you run up 5 flights of stairs to make it faster."
<RaveBrony> GilDash: Look it up, im sure there plenty of compilations on youtube. Theyre great :D
<RainbowDerpy> this Xmas music is giving me a headache
<RaveBrony> Its basically Yakko's catch phrase, lol
<GilDash> RaveBrony: Maybe when I'm capable of lucid thought. :D
<RainbowDerpy> that link made me laugh
<GilDash> If it's two mares teaming up to paint an apple orchard, then yes, I see what you see.

<GilDash> pony_3045: They also turn their stomaches inside-out to envelope their prey to eat them.
<Kjakings> 7"What operating system are you running?" "Um. Windows Vista." "ROY. WE'RE GOING TO DIE."
<trixie_squirtle> pony_3405 heh guess the spongebob writers knew that

<Stormy> I've seen a lot of people who are new to forums try that in their signatures
<pony_3045> tree
<CCharmanderK> Too much synth in this song. >_<
<pony_3045> CCharmanderK, agreed
<cachi01> gunthler: yes :|
<GigabitHarmonie> Not enough synth!
<cachi01> gunthler: but i fixed it
<GigabitHarmonie> Never enough synth!
<cachi01> so HA!
<Stormy> When I joined my first forum I knew just enough to know that wouldn't work, but not enough to know how to actually do it
<cachi01> oh hi GigabitHarmonie :) u streaming?
<GigabitHarmonie> Synth all the things!
<GigabitHarmonie> Eeyup cachi01. :)
<cachi01> cool :)
<MadSurge> GigabitHarmonie: I NEED MORE COWBELL
<pony_3045> and autotune ikr
<Kjakings> 7I kinda feel like I wasted my time on SC: surrounded by computer geeks, decided to learn nothing about coding or hacking.
<RainbowDerpy> http://cheezburger.com/6830415872
<GilDash> They threw a lot of synth into Dream Theater's Falling Into Infinity. It was one of their badder albums. :S
<CCharmanderK> Can we move on to another song? One that ISN'T synth-heavy?
<GilDash> Though, it was still pretty solid.
<Stormy> Not all of us were computer geeks; I definitely wasn't at the time
<pony_3045> picture: observe all shuks what i was given!
<CCharmanderK> What the FUCK is this?!!
<RainbowDerpy> hey wat is pink and disposible
<wipergone2> gnight everypony
<GigabitHarmonie> Hahahaha.
<Stormy> I still feel like I don't know anything compared to a lot of people on the internet, but whatever, I don't want programming to be my life anyway
<GilDash> That is the power of Screwball.
<RainbowDerpy> hey wat is pink and disposible
<RainbowDerpy> Pinkies mouth
<Vordox> GigabitHarmonie: Applebloom: "Seriously"? :P
<wipergone2> RainbowDerpy: bye

<CCharmanderK> Just how it should be.
<wipergone2> gonna sleep

<CCharmanderK> Music to my ears.
<Kjakings> 7Then you would do poorly in the matrix.
<GigabitHarmonie> I'm going to play a synth song just for you CCharmanderK! :)
<RainbowDerpy> NO

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Tech services are free, but if I google your problem and there is a solution on the first page, you owe me $50.
<DashWithRainbows> I could bring up a rather disgusting substance and it would still be better than bacon, trixie_squirtle.
<DashWithRainbows> So be glad I chose air :P
<Stormy> Heh, I wish
<Stormy> I'd definitely get fired if I did that though

*Haku1013 is alone apparently
<Stormy> I wonder how many people would believe I can do that
<GilDash> MadSurge: It's a full meal here as well. It's usually actually eaten at brunch and serves as breakfast and lunch because it's so big.
<MadSurge> GilDash: makes sense
<Haku1013> hmm hmm

<trixie_sprinkle> rashwithdainbows is probably the best deeweearr form
<DashWithRainbows> Naw
<pony_1502> I see an ad that seems exactly what franchise Legos, Minecraft and Roblox has been following.
<DashWithRainbows> It ain't.
<CrystalPhoenix> I didn't know Bon Jovi has a restaurant with no price on the menu.
<trixie_sprinkle> then what is?
<DashWithRainbows> That is for you to find out, trixie_sprinkle.
<trixie_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: well until i find out, i'll have to keep experimentating myself then
<DashWithRainbows> 'kay-'kay.
<trixie_sprinkle> mashwithpainbows
<AssaultWithEmbraces> How's everyone doing?
<DashWithRainbows> I'll be sitting here, playing Pokemon until then, trixie_sprinkle.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/HAmIJ.jpg guess which this game is from
<GilDash> AssaultWithEmbraces: Surviving! :D
<pony_1502> Bored. A little
<pony_1502> I need a funny link
<trixie_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: which pokemon?
<DashWithRainbows> Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness.
<pony_1502> From a non square version of minecraft
<alexxm> Bronysith fallout
<Bronysith> alexxm: which one?
<trixie_sprinkle> ah, never plated any mystery dungeons myself
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Really? Which part you at?
<trixie_sprinkle> *played
<DashWithRainbows> You're missing out, trixie_sprinkle.
<alexxm> Bronysith 3
<DashWithRainbows> Damn fine series.
<Bronysith> alexxm: FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSE
<pony_1502> I have more taste in Fossil Fighters Champions.
<alexxm> Bronysith which one is it
<GilDash> trixie_sprinkle: It's easily one of the better Pokemon games out there.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm at the part with the foggy forest, GilDash.
<DashWithRainbows> Only started last night.
<Bronysith> alexxm: fallout 1
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dat Celestia
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Ah, I think I remember. It's been a couple of years.
<pony_1502> She took a shower.
<trixie_sprinkle> well maybe i'll look it up, iirc last time i saw it i wasnt too interested
<pony_3045> stupid sexy tia
<DashWithRainbows> Well, if you need the emulator ROM for this one or PMD: Blue rescue team, give me a shout, trixie_sprinkle.
<RainbowDerpy> GOD that is disturbing
<pony_1502> I'm gonna get on Moonbase Alpha soon, unless something phenomenon happens
<trixie_sprinkle> kk thx DashWithRainbows
<pony_3045> aeiou
<Bronysith> pony_1502: just go and quit your bitchin
<pony_1502> Not much to do, sorry if I offended you.
<J_E_Smith71> Jingle Bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg...
<DashWithRainbows> GilDash It's name Fogbound Lake.
<Derp_Derp> LUNA
<AssaultWithEmbraces> The Batmobile lost a wheel and The Joker took ballet
<DashWithRainbows> Not sure you may remember it though.
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Is that before or after the guild expedition?
*Derp_Derp hugs luna
<trixie_sprinkle> so many awesome magic duel pics now
<DashWithRainbows> It is the expedition.
<Derp_Derp> aww
<J_E_Smith71> AssaultWithEmbraces: Superman died and Wonder Woman cried and Doomsday got away
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Ah! That explains it then! XD
<DashWithRainbows> The only part about this expedition is the following:
<pony_1502> This reminds me of how I got banned 3 years ago.
<DashWithRainbows> YOU'RE PAIRED WITH A BIDOOF
<DashWithRainbows> GYAAAH
<pony_1502> Now I remember
<DashWithRainbows> annoying part*
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Yeah, but to be fair, rollout isn't all that bad.
<CrystalPhoenix> http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/337/8/e/poof__by_j_z_a-d5mzldw.png
<trixie_sprinkle> pony_1502: huh, i dont think bronystate was around 3 years ago
<DashWithRainbows> He never uses it.
<DashWithRainbows> Only growl.
<pony_1502> Sure seemed 3 years.
<pony_1502> But it really felt like 1000
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Just deactivate his useless attacks and leave only Rollout on... if you can do that.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm taking all the hits, my Mudkip called Steve provides me some firepower / chance to heal up.
<DashWithRainbows> You can't modify his moves
<DashWithRainbows> Which sucks.
<DashWithRainbows> Headbutt is alright with the cringe affect on it.
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Oh, is he on as a guest member at that point?
<DashWithRainbows> Yep.
<GilDash> Balls.
<pony_1502> Bidoof forgot Giga Impact to learn Growl!
<trixie_sprinkle> i remember buying one of those fake pokemon games as a kid, pokemon jade. was trippy stuff
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: In that case, don't forget your reviver seeds. :D
<pony_1502> Pokemon Creepy Black for sure.
<trixie_sprinkle> i never beat it either, didnt know what to do at some point
<alexxm> why would you do that pony_1502
<DashWithRainbows> I always pack at least 5 reviver seeds.
<DashWithRainbows> Whenever I see them in the shop, I buy the,m
<pony_1502> It was just kinda funny
<DashWithRainbows> them*
<pony_1502> Be like a goddangit moment
<pony_1502> Is it bad that I still build cars out of Legos
<DashWithRainbows> Nope.
<SkunkTauri> What song is this
<pony_1502> She's afraid someone can see her somewhere off camera?
<aniderp> dat jaymoo lurking?
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I played Explorers of Sky, and they had the Spinda shop. It made getting gummis really worthwhile, because you made a drink from them and got stat increases.
<pony_1502> Oh, it's the cameraman.
<DashWithRainbows> Dayum
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/TwyjH.jpg if you dont know who this is i am going to murder you
<aniderp> who streaming?
<pony_1502> Nintendo Worker.
<J_E_Smith71> aniderp: Gigabit
<DashWithRainbows> Sounds pretty good, Gildash, I only played Blue rescue team, couldn't afford the 4th gen ones at the time
<Socks> Hello everypony :)
<pony_1502> I even see a post in Japanese in the back
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Ah, I never played the first one. Only Explorers of Sky.
<DashWithRainbows> Forgot about the series after a while until I found my old PMD case.
<pony_3045> thats pikachu!
<alexxm> how've you been Socks
<pony_625934244> Isn't there a new one on the 3DS in Japan?
<DashWithRainbows> It was pretty good, not many of my friends liked it, I loved it however.
<Socks> alexxm: Better than can be expected :) How are you?
<alexxm> i'm good Socks
<DashWithRainbows> There is one for the 3DS out right now, only in japanese though.
<Socks> Awesome times
<DashWithRainbows> Looks okay, still prefer 2D.
<sub06905> hmmm who is streaming?
<RainbowDashie> :)
<pony_1502> I don't think anyone likes or even USES the Spike theatre.
<J_E_Smith71> sub06905: Gigabit's back and he is
<sub06905> ohai GigaplotHarmonie
<Socks> I use spike theatre if I need to watch an episode without chat
<pony_3045> pony_1502, too bad
<sub06905> lel plot
<FlutterMEDIC> Bronysith: i'm now jelly that you met Miyamoto
<Socks> Which is all the time :P
*MLP_Brovakiin glomps Socks "Hai!" :)
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I have to admit, the dungeon crawling could get a bit excessive at times, but the story made me play it.
<pony_1502> Well I see one that uses it
<Bronysith> FlutterMEDIC: well thank you
<Socks> MLP_Brovakiin: Heyo :)
<alexxm> rainbow and her pet cloud
<pony_1502> It's been showing this for a long time now
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, I liked the change of being the Pokemon instead of the trainer to be great. Story was pretty interesting, dungeons could be annoying at times but some really paid off with the items inside.
<pony_1502> there we go
<Socks> What's happening on stream? I'm just on chat ATM
<sub06905> music
<pony_3045> Boreale i choose you!

<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354576418012.jpg
<alexxm> Socks we're listening to christmas music
<J_E_Smith71> Socks: Giga's doing a music stream
<DashWithRainbows> It's a radio show, Socks.
<RainbowDerpy> lol just saw funniest pic ever
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: It's when you got down to F15 and it's just a rest area. "What?! I've got another 10 floors to go? Oh god, why?" XD
<FlutterMEDIC> blah
<pony_1502> Dat Flower.
<RainbowDerpy> http://cheezburger.com/6757880320
<Socks> Ok, Not missing too much, I can get back to writing.
<DashWithRainbows> GilDash I remember a dungeon with 99 floors.
<DashWithRainbows> It was torture
<Bronysith> so fucking old posts
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Yeah, but that was the "Congrats, you've beat the game, now beat this."
<DashWithRainbows> True.
<pony_1502> That videogame is steam powered.
<DashWithRainbows> I think you find either Mewtwo or Deoxy's in it though.
<pony_1502> Not worth 99 floors
<sub06905> dat cheerilee
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, it was if you wanted a good challenfe.
<DashWithRainbows> challenge*
<pony_1502> I can see myself staying up all Saturday playing that one dungeon
<DashWithRainbows> That's what I did.
<Polygrammar> I just wanna say
<Polygrammar> I love all you guys
<GigaplotHarmonie> :)
<GilDash> I don't think I'd ever finish it.
<sub06905> wub
<GigaplotHarmonie> Love you too!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Love you too Polygrammar o3o
<pony_1502> Infinity mode: Play till you drop
<DashWithRainbows> Sat on the sofa, bottles of soda and some pie in the kitchen, grinding the hell out of it.
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I think there was one that was also 99 floors but removed all your items and set you to level 1.
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, I think that was it.
<sub06905> wow
<pony_1502> Get to level 100 by floor 32
<DashWithRainbows> Bloody hard but was an amazing challenge.
<DashWithRainbows> Made you want to grind your EXP before taking on the next floor.
<pony_3045> what game are you talking to?
<Buytoast> what? Thousand Year Door?
<pony_1502> My teacher isn't a pony. Just a 47 year old Science human
<DashWithRainbows> Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series, pony_3045
<pony_3045> oh
<Buytoast> bah
<Polygrammar> Woah, what?

<RainbowDerpy> be cool
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Who are you running with? Mudkip and...?
<pony_1502> I think NFS Nitro
<SkunkTauri> i got totodile once
<DashWithRainbows> I'm a Cyndaquil.
<sub06905> lel
<pony_1502> I got Cyndaquil when I played
<pony_1502> and a Phanpy friend
<Vordox> Suddenly Mafia
<JFFS> nice radio voice.
<Polygrammar> I got Piplup
<Polygrammar> But I kept doing the test until I got Cyndiquil
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I think I ran with Torchic/Mudkip my first time, then Riolu/Treecko my second.
<pony_1502> Ironic, Typhlosion is my favorite pokemon of all time
<DashWithRainbows> Wait
<pony_3045> plot
<Vordox> <--- RAUNCHY
<Derpy_Hooves> GigaplotHarmonie :3
<RainbowDashie> :O
<DashWithRainbows> You could get Riolu?
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I think that was Sky only.
<GigaplotHarmonie> Derpy_Hooves! :)
<DashWithRainbows> Dayum.
<DashWithRainbows> Lucky.
*Derpy_Hooves hugs GigaplotHarmonie :3
<sub06905> dat twilight
*GigaplotHarmonie hugs Derpy_Hooves back!
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Eh, he wasn't all that good to be honest.
<pony_1502> First pokemon I got to Level 100 was Typhlosion
<weylin|Blarg> o,o

<DashWithRainbows> Hmmm
*RainbowDerpy gives everypony hugs
<weylin|Blarg> and what's this about pokemons
<GigaplotHarmonie> Oh look! It's my mousepad!
<pony_1502> XD
<SkunkTauri> i kept on doing the test until i got totodile
<DashWithRainbows> I went with this pair because of the weakness/strength could cover each other.
*Socks never got any pokemon past level 50 :(
<Polygrammar> How many times did it take you?
<aniderp> derpy <3
<pony_1502> You rub your mouse on his face? How could you

<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: I went with my favourites, basically. Went with Riolu/Treecko the second time just to see the other side of the pond.
<pony_1502> Mealworms eating either Corn/Apple/something else
<DashWithRainbows> I wish I could've had Ralts as a starter.
<pony_1502> See waht they choose
*aniderp feels alone
<GilDash> Ralts would have been pretty cool.
<DashWithRainbows> Alas, I had to go with /actual/ starters.
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs aniderp :)
<pony_1502> My first ever Pokemon game was Crystal. Best storyline of all games I've ever played

<pony_1502> I race-tuned my GT-R
<oni_link> I like the R34 Skyline better
<scout19_tf2> wut?
<MLP_Brovakiin> O.o
<pony_1502> People like to tune the Bugatti but... they can't control it. Fail
<sub06905> great now i want to go play nfs or forza
<sub06905> :I
<pony_3045> search vvvvvv veni vidi vici
<pony_3045> youtube
<scout19_tf2> kks
<oni_link> So who's playing music for us atm?
<sub06905> giga is
<SkunkTauri> The two fastest cars are the Bugatti Veyron and the Ultimate Aero
<oni_link> oh nice!
<pony_3045> and that what twilight doing at chrystal empire )
<GilDash> I'm quite enjoying the music right now, actually.
<pony_1502> Koenigsegg Agera R recorded a top speed of 271
<pony_3045> so thats why shy Twilight Viridian
<pony_1502> MPH.
<SkunkTauri> was the fastest
<Polygrammar> Hush now, quiet now
<cachi01> oh i know this song
<cachi01> its from that pony show
<pony_1502> Bugatti is a heavy car that i think is overpowered
<cachi01> that adult like
<cachi01> weeeiird
<pony_1502> I was so glad that Koenigsegg beat it in Bugatti's face
<sub06905> bugatti op nerf plz
<ShiningDawn> this is nice
<cachi01> is this smile smile smile by applejack?
<oni_link> lol I don't want to go to sleep
<pony_1502> Bugatti: 1001 HP and top speed of 260? That's not overpowered?
<ShiningDawn> no sweetie belle rest ur head
<pony_1502> I loved the McLaren F1 until that Bugatti smooshed it
<SkunkTauri> what about the ultimate Aero
<pony_1502> I don't care much for the aero
<pony_1502> Bugatti is uglu
<pony_1502> but people drive caused by performance
<pony_1502> When I raced the Bugatti when I played, I drove next to it and crashed it into the wall 7 times.
<GigaplotHarmonie> :) Hope you enjoyed that interlude!
<SkunkTauri> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSC_Aero

<ScootaChicken> Wait, I thought GigaplotHarmonie left BronyState?
<pony_1502> stuck inside out

<ScootaChicken> Well, either way it's great to see you! (even though I talk to you on skype loads anyway, haha)

<pony_1502> The movie sucks.
<sub06905> best pony
<pony_3045> for fun
<Haku1013> VenHur Im gonna beat a mothabicka with another mothabucka
<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan: I've been alright too, loads of schoolwork mind.
<Socks> thelonepony: You are no longer a cubone!
*cachi01 slaps VenHur with a thelonepony
<pony_1502> You are now a grown up orphan
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: at least this semester is almost overwith
<pony_3045> cube is now pony
<VenHur> cachi01: Blasphemy!
<pony_1502> One does not simply kill Dashgor with one arrow!
<Haku1013> glomps Bronysith
<StinkomanFan> Yeah, yeah... I've been working in my senior year.
<StinkomanFan> BRB
<cachi01> VenHur: lel
*Bronysith carries Haku1013 to bed
<Bronysith> <3
<pony_1502> I've got a horn, I can, you know, use magic?
*Haku1013 doesnt want to go to bread
<ScootaChicken> Oh yeah Bronysith, you like Death Note, don't you?
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: well, up till after you died >.>
<GilDash> This is a rather... ambient song?
<Haku1013> nyeh
<pony_1502> If you're a unicorn and can just teleport, who needs flying
<GilDash> Sounds like something from a videogame of olden times.
<Haku1013> If only you can teleport
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: Well here's a thing me and my friend did: https://docs.google.com/a/ucs.org.uk/document/d/1EIu-tNpU026JkFT-Ful4koBPrRdGWyQ7E9y1Oxg7g-8/edit We're performing it for our next GCSE assessment, I'd appreciate any feedback you have :3
<JFFS> GilDash: indeed...
<pony_3045> ded
<ScootaChicken> Sames goes for anyone else here who happens to like Death Note.
<SkunkTauri> this song reminds of terraria
<scout19_tf2> GilDash: just mute and listen to other pony songs
<Haku1013> Teleporting is obviously a very difficult thing to do, since Twilight had trouble with it at first even though her talent is magic
<ScootaChicken> Just be careful to not violate the document too much.
<pony_1502> She formed that talent with practice, anything is hard at a toddler age
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: what a fanfiction? or just acting out? XD, sounds fun
<Haku1013> Telekinisis is probably the only thing any unicorn can do by default
<Haku1013> Yes, but she used telekinis in the 3rd episode
<pony_1502> Reading minds?
<pony_3045> guys
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: We adapted the first half of the show for our next assessment, but we need the script to be as good as possible.
<GilDash> I'm not complaining, just noticing.
<Haku1013> And she looked exhausted after just 3 times using it, and those were just short distances
<pony_3045> celestia ask twilight juggling animals for fun
<pony_3045> why not
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: right, ill read it and let ya know, grammar and all or other cliches you could possibly avoid XD
<pony_1502> Applejack didn't learn anything.
<pony_1502> I learned that the Flim Flam brothers suck.
<Kimori> Is that real?
<RainbowDerpy> YES
<scout19_tf2> RANDOMNESS
<scout19_tf2> :)
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: This is me you're talking about, I doubt there are any grammatical mistakes, and even if there are, it's mainly the content I want feedback on (particuarly the last few acts, which I changed rather dramatically from the source material.)
<pony_1502> He's teaching us how to stram
<pony_1502> stream*
<ScootaChicken> I've basically made the last couple of scenes a Death Note Yaoi fangirl's wet dream.
<pony_3045> flim kissed applebloom
<scout19_tf2> yay
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: aight....im guessing you are getting yahooz to play Light?
<pony_1502> Molestation is imminent

<pony_1502> Giga.

<String_Shredder> What DAW is this, Gigaplot?
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: Lawl, I wish, this is a GCSE piece for school.

<pony_3045> im very hungry, gimme that Apple
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: ahh
<pony_1502> I'm sorry, I sell pumpkin pie.
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: The guy playing Light is actually one of the worst actors in the set, our teacher chose our groups for this, unfortunately, it's lucky I got to be in the same group as the guy who's massively into Death Note.
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: ahh okay
<thelonecubone> Is GigaplotHarmonie streaming? :O
<VenHur> I'm a fan of the Vectorman games.

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Poll Results: Did Your Opinion of Trixie Change After Magic Duel?

<CrystalPhoenix> GigaplotHarmonie, what type of setting are you trying to achieve in this piece?
<CrystalPhoenix> sound futuristic
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: I don't think it's how the series should have ended. I do however, think that the series shouldn't have had all the time skip bullshit, it should have ended with L and Light.
<ScootaChicken> Near and Mello are a pair of fucking bellends.
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: exactly....but seriously, im sure all the fangirls are going to love you
<pony_1502> I'm gonna find a correct remix of a song I like and post it
<pony_3045> i think Death Note is slightly homosexual
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> slightly?
<pony_1502> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_qF_FSfm8E
<Buytoast> is that...
<pony_3045> maybe not so slightly
<Buytoast> A FORBIDDEN LINK?

<VenHur> ^ Underrated song is underrated.
<pony_3045> ded
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, OH GOD SOMEONE ELSE IS WITH ME
<CrystalPhoenix> I LOVE Flim Flam song
<RainbowDerpy> ^^^ is an amazing song
<CrystalPhoenix> so hard to sing
<VenHur> I love Super Squeesy Something 6000.

<pony_1502> I think that some cars that are overrated pwn when tuned
<Buytoast> well that is the greatest song
<CountDoofus> It's one of my favorite songs too :)
<pony_3045> i love how they kissed applebloom
<Buytoast> so at least you aren't completely wrong

<pony_1502> We'll be coming back?
<pony_1502> It is in a game
<CrystalPhoenix> so this is a remix?

<VenHur> Cause I would love to try it out for myself.
<Yahooz> letme check
<Kandarihu> Oh, is this GigabitHarmonie streaming?
<pony_1502> let's go in fulscreen and zoom
<CrystalPhoenix> is GigaplotHarmonie making really a remix?
<scout19_tf2> VenHur: why dnt u ask him

<CrystalPhoenix> Also VenHur you good in music composition?
<VenHur> scout19_tf2: Cause he stealin' muh brownie.
<pony_1502> Boredd. So bored I see double D's.
<Yahooz> either way, i would recomend FruityLoops
<CountDoofus> I shouldn't be watching this. I've been thinking about trying to make music too, but then I'll lose interest in drawing. Same thing happened when writing fics, then moving on to drawing :|
<VenHur> CrystalPhoenix: Not really, but I sometimes like to make either a remix or an entirely original song in general.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> freaking ad scared the dizzle out of me
<CrystalPhoenix> GigaplotHarmonie, you better type it out
<GigaplotHarmonie> Mixcraft

<RainbowDerpy> RD is best pony
<basball901> sounding good
<RainbowDerpy> evidence: Sonic Rainboom
<cachikorita01> RainbowDashie: uhmmmm thats a pretty lame evidence
<Panda> Rarity is best pony. Just not many know it yet
<trixie_sprinkle> rarity is an acceptable answer
<RainbowDerpy> QUIT CALLING ME RAINBOWDASHIE
<CrystalPhoenix> RainbowDerpy, but can she make clothes?
<Yahooz> fact: that doesnt prove anything
<RainbowDerpy> ITS RAINBOWDERPY
<cachikorita01> Rarity is better than rd like 10000000 times
<Panda> ^
<RainbowDerpy> orly?
<trixie_sprinkle> rd is good too
<pony_1502> Dodge Viper GTS VS Chevrolet Corvette ZR1

<trixie_sprinkle> and blueblood
<sub06905> trixie_sprinkle: D:
<Dark_Horst> oh look. carbines
<RainbowDerpy> Rarity is a whiny bitch
<J_E_Smith71> cachikorita01: Think we better say Rarity is best pony while she's packing that gun...
<cachikorita01> trixie_sprinkle: thats not how you spell rainbow dash
<RainbowDerpy> no offense
<sub06905> but blueblood ;3;
<VenHur> Blueblood, I can handle that, but FLUTTERSHY?!
<Randomnerd> lol J_E_Smith71
<trixie_sprinkle> sub06905: fine, youre right, maybe i am a wee bit harsh on blueblood..
<cachikorita01> J_E_Smith71: LOL wasnt paying attention to stream xd
<sub06905> trixie_sprinkle: :D
<RainbowDerpy> Blueblood's a prick
<CrystalPhoenix> RainbowDerpy, Rainbow Dash always dresses in style but she needs clothes for that. Who's making clothes? Rarity that's who
<CrystalPhoenix> Thus, Rarity is best pony
<trixie_sprinkle> VenHur: after the last episode its practically canon that she has a mean side to her
<cachikorita01> inb4 rarity is 2nd best poneh
<RainbowDerpy> since when does RD make sunglasses
<trixie_sprinkle> VenHur: as in permanent mean side

<RainbowDerpy> G4 IS BEST OUT OF ALL GENS
<VenHur> G3.5 makes Chuck Norris cry.

<Bronysith> RainbowDerpy: only you are getting pissed off
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh alrighty

<DinkyDoo> cachi01: NO. She is the element of Honesty, part of the Mane 6. MAIN 6.
<RainbowDerpy> no its Mane 6
<RainbowDerpy> not Main
<Shammy> cachi01 Bronysith you two knock it off stop fucking with the newfoals
<DashWithRainbows> :L
<DinkyDoo> Main sounds like Mane.
<DashWithRainbows> Both are used
<cachi01> sowwy Shammy :I
<DinkyDoo> So in case you don't get why its called the ''Mane'' six, I used ''Main''.
<Kandarihu> Most of the Crystal Ponies, I'd say they are probably the most forgotten.
<RainbowDerpy> its a pun
<Buytoast> probably
<RainbowDerpy> horses have manes
<Buytoast> the rock horses aren't all that memorable
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: uhmmm you do know i was just messing a little wit u guys right?
<Panda> Now add some base and snare and you got a hip hop lullaby!!!
<DinkyDoo> cachi01: *I, With, You. (Sorry, I had to correct..)
<Shammy> cachi01...a little? come now stop being an ass
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: lol
<RainbowDerpy> Dinky its a pun, horses have manes
<Buytoast> even with sombrero horse assaulting them and such
<DinkyDoo> Oh...

<DinkyDoo> DAT AD
<ImAProYouDontKnow> Gunna go get it
<LunaRoyalGuard> :D
<pony_26> ownership is magic
<Kandarihu> That's right. King Sombra is more notable than the ponies he was trying to conquer. And then we gripe about how weak characterization he got.
<VenHur> At first, I didn't know what Mixcraft is until I found out.
<Bronysith> at least we dont see shining armor or cadance ever again
<DinkyDoo> I'm gonna fall asleep listening to this music sooner or later..
<Bronysith> hopefully
<trixie_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well they all had weak characterization
<VenHur> Thanks to the holy grail of Google's search engine.
<cachi01> Bronysith: inb4 they appear in next ep
<RainbowDerpy> hey who here can name any GOOD cartoons on nowadays besides MLP
<Buytoast> don't corral your horses before the running there boy
<Kandarihu> And it's true that he did have weak characterization, compared to the other villains.
<Buytoast> the mary sue horse force will strike again
<pony_1502> that's hard
<Buytoast> and they will save the world again
<Bronysith> cachi01: wouldnt be surprised, considering the last episode was one giant fucking mash of all the fanfictions ever
<DinkyDoo> Wait, who is streaming..
<cachi01> RainbowDerpy: gravity falls, adventure time, gumball, regular show
<Bronysith> it was hilarious like that
<RainbowDerpy> Gumball sucks
<pony_1502> they said in 2014 NFS will work with Disney to make a movie
<cachi01> Bronysith: indeed it was. one of the best imo
<DashWithRainbows> Hmm
<DashWithRainbows> Guys
<DinkyDoo> cachi01: I agree on Gravity Falss, but the rest I can't agree on..
<DashWithRainbows> Give me a food name.

<Bronysith> RainbowDerpy: um no
<ImAProYouDontKnow> +Dashwithrainbows Muffin
<DinkyDoo> anton: No video links during streams.
<cachi01> anton: one does not simply post a non-image link on stream
<Buytoast> is that...
<Buytoast> A FORBIDDEN LINK?
<RainbowDerpy> P&F, GF i agree with
<anton> srry
<DinkyDoo> aton: And psh, the Blank Flank ending isn't even THAT scary.
<cachi01> yes it is
<cachi01> it fucking is
<DinkyDoo> I played it, and I got that ending.
<cachi01> we talkin bout filly adventures right?
<DinkyDoo> I was like: ''OMIGOSH THAT ENDING IS AWESOME.''

<Kandarihu> I watched the Season 3 premier again lately. And you know what? It's not even about Sombra. It's not REALLY about the Crystal Ponies either. It's about Twilight Sparkle trying to follow Princess Celestia's directions and prove herself. This is an odd case where the primary antagonist could be seen as a minor character.

<PrincessCholestrolia> not too hard
<sonicdude558> No shipping notification after that
<Kandarihu> trixie_sprinkle, I don't know. Sounds like it's akin to ordering something at the drive through of a fast food restaurant and then driving off after paying for it. Not really illegal, but just messed up.
<CrystalPhoenix> I wish I could sing
<RainbowDerpy> do u even know who is in the CMC cachi
<PrincessCholestrolia> Cutie Mark Crusaders

<SpadeKyurem[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71bRykr8ULU&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Lets do this texas style
<Leonnatus> LINK ALL THE VIDEOS!
<VenHur> This sideshow should be playing more often instead of that old buffer show.
<VenHur> Anypony agreed?
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: Since we're using UStream the slideshow has been used all the time. No more buffer show
<SpadeKyurem[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHwyca7gu7E&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Sorry Snoop but your weed is in another castle
<Kandarihu> So, once again Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 is on discount. For once, I have money in my Steam Wallet and no more probation against spending it. Is there any reason to buy L4D1 with L4D2 or not?
<DashWithRainbows> Great games, worth the cash. Some people prefer L4D1, I'm in the middle.
<Nittany_Discord> I actually like L4D2 more.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> AGH!
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka time
<Nittany_Discord> But they are both good games.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> I had my volume up so high. :D
<VenHur> The Dark Shizuka Rises
<Kandarihu> Oh, I was planning on asking this question to Shizuka specifically. I didn't know she was around.
<VenHur> And she's looking for your chocolate.
<oni_link> yay :3
<HoodyKazam> Shizuka!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> When the stream is in ashes then you have my permission to stop streaming
<HoodyKazam> Yay!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im thinking about getting into the dawn of war series, which one should I get?
<VenHur> FOR YOUR CHOCOLAAAAAAATE!!
<SpadeKyurem[R]> VenHur: did you say...chocolate?!
<VenHur> SpadeKyurem[R]: Yes sir! With or without nuts?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> VenHur: CHOCOLATE? CHOCOLAAAAATE! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAATE!
<DashWithRainbows> I have 6 days to get £10 for copies of L4D1 + L4D2...
<DashWithRainbows> I think this can be done.
*VenHur runs away
<Kandarihu> Man, as of Friday evening, I was under three self-restrictions at once.
<jcelios> sounds kinky
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im thinking about getting into the dawn of war series, which one should I get?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> jcelios: :S
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: How so?
<DinkyDoolHomework> I don't like doing Homework.. D:
<Kandarihu> One of the restrictions was for a billing screwup with Steam. Nothing that would get me in trouble, But for reasons I don't want to go into, I decided to restrict myself from spending from the Steam Wallet and running Magicka, which I had already recently bought DLC for.
<weylin|Blarg> DinkyDoo|Homework, I don't think anyone really does unless it's interesting o^o
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ah, I see.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> weylin|Blarg: Homework can be interesting. :D
<DinkyDoo> I just have to read for Homework, though, so its not that bad....
<Dark_Horst> is it just me or is the ausio wacky?
<Dark_Horst> *audio
<weylin|Blarg> Dark_Horst, I get cracks here and there
<Kandarihu> The second was less of a punishment and more of a challenge. In Space Pirates and Zombies, the save file in which I got the Freighter Hull in Chapter 2 got corrupted and I forgot how to do it. So I had a hard time figuring that out again.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ouch, that stinks.
<sonicdude558> weed...?
<CrystalPhoenix> Anyone wants to have their ears bleed?
<sonicdude558> Damn dat ytp fad
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> No thanks, CrystalPhoenix.
<CrystalPhoenix> In other words can anyone help me out on something
<DinkyDoo> She had DISAPPEARED.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> CrystalPhoenix: That depends. What do you need help with?
<Kandarihu> Well, it turns out that the key is having UTA assistance and using bombs to knock the Freighter off course.
<thelonecubone> comcast, i hate you so much
<DinkyDoo> LOST. So does that mean ded?
<Kandarihu> And the third restriction was the harshest. I honorbanned myself from Bronystate again.
<thelonecubone> and i'm back, for the fourth time :I
<thelonecubone> shitty comcast :I
<DashWithRainbows> I need a food name for a Minun.
<Kandarihu> Oh, AJIsHaunter|Homework, I didn't notice you were gone.
<Kandarihu> Well, it turns out that the key is having UTA assistance and using bombs to knock the Freighter off course.
<DashWithRainbows> What should it be?
<cachikorita01> dat naruto
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ah, my apologies. My chat crashed and I had to reboot it.
*thelonecubone pokes cachikorita01 o3o
<cachikorita01> thelonecubone: lel
<thelonecubone> ikr
<oni_link> Time for noms
<thelonecubone> Shitty comcast is shitty :I
<cachikorita01> thelonecubone: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/214/234/95334%20-%20animated%20DRESS.MOV%20fluttershy%20poking%20twilight_sparkle.gif
<DinkyDoo> No longer with us.. is Kuu dead?
<Kandarihu> So the third restriction was the harshest. I honorbanned myself from Bronystate again. 72 hours. I missed BMN, the episode premiere and EMN and whatever awesome stuff happened around then.
<cachikorita01> Kandarihu: you missed slendermane
<jcelios> Wing Cancer :_(
<thelonecubone> ^
<Kandarihu> cachikorita01, So a ponified Slenderman?
<cachikorita01> Kandarihu: http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354502267218.png right below mayor mare
<cachikorita01> not edited
<CrystalPhoenix> cachikorita01, oh Blaknie
<CrystalPhoenix> Blankie**
<thelonecubone> cachikorita01: lel
<cachikorita01> wait
<cachikorita01> the called her blankie?
<cachikorita01> o u fandom
<cachikorita01> they*
<cachikorita01> Kandarihu: http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354504613577.png
<cachikorita01> just ignore the pasta
<CrystalPhoenix> cachikorita01, well I'm not sure of the name but it's definitely not Slendermane
<cachikorita01> CrystalPhoenix: of course it isnt lel
<cachikorita01> CrystalPhoenix: im just naming her like that in the mean time the fandom gives her a name
<Kandarihu> cachikorita01, lol. Dat creepypasta.
<Shizuka> 13oh i see what you mean about the derps
<Shizuka> 13moment
<Kandarihu> So, were people spamming R63 too?
<Kandarihu> I did Youtube the episode. It was the first time I ever went to Youtube for the episode.
<DashWithRainbows> cachikorita01 Regarding that image link; TL;DR
<cachikorita01> DashWithRainbows: lol
<cachikorita01> DashWithRainbows: its about the faceless pony being a virus or something
<Kandarihu> Now if only this guy with the Warez-BB thread would release the WEB-DL 720p version. All he posted so far is the HDTV 1080p version.
<Buytoast> THAT'S the crappypasta?
<Buytoast> it's even more far fetched than i thought it was
<DashWithRainbows> Meh.
<Shizuka> 13dammit vac stop derping..

<J_E_Smith71> Brother_Aura: Yes. Yes they did
<Kandarihu> Alright, Haruhi!
<HoodyKazam> Shizuka: Haruhism is dead
<twixie_sprinkle> well my leg has been hurting all day so i cant jump very well
*thelonecubone slaps sprunkls around a bit with a chancla
<oni_link> have no idea
<Shizuka> 13RIP GOD
<Dark_Horst> i have no idea whats going on anyway
<oni_link> maybe times change Shizuka
*HoodyKazam slaps himself around a bit with a bucket ;~;
<twixie_sprinkle> thelonecubone: i hpe that thing is clean
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Shizuka: Do they ever expand on why Haruhi has these powers?
<CurlyQ> omg i love her voice.
<[Alpha]> Hmm for some reason people think Bronies are pedophiles on the Internet.
<Shizuka> 13she just does
*thelonecubone slaps hoode around a bit with a chancla
<thelonecubone> :3
<Kandarihu> I'm theorizing that it's all withing Haruhi's dreams or something.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> [Alpha]: Blame society?
<twixie_sprinkle> does show have any plot left though?
<Shizuka> 13NOM
<[Alpha]> Oh no the dreaded Chancla it used to be scary
<cachikorita01> is this bleaaaaaach?
<oni_link> dam nom
<thelonecubone> naw
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Hmm. I see that as a big plothole for this show, then.
<[Alpha]> I blame ignorance and society
<thelonecubone> cachikorita01: its has more of an a adventure
<Kandarihu> cachikorita01, It's haruuuuuuhi
<TROctavia> hey everyone
<thelonecubone> so its Jojo Bizarre adventure's blachi
<thelonecubone> Hi TROctavia :)
<Shizuka> 13AJIsHaunter|Homework: i think it's mostly because the question is academic
<cachikorita01> Kandarihu: EHRMAGERD GUD KNAUS
<Shizuka> 13the only thing the universe needs to care about is that haruhi has the ability to wipe it and start over
<[Alpha]> Buck it. I'm permanently changing my name to Golden Cyanide
<cachikorita01> thelonecubone: lel
<Kandarihu> cachikorita01, YUSHUH!
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Shizuka: Yeesh, she's pretty dangerous.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> So I'm guessing she's not from Earth?
<Shizuka> 13we may never know
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, the only alien in the group is Yuki.
<CurlyQ> :D
<Golden> Alright
<pony_970> And she's also a robot.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ah. So everyone else are humans, just with special powers?
<cachikorita01> dat ass
<Shizuka> 13AJIsHaunter|Homework: yuki's an alien sent by the Data Integration Entity or something like that, mikuru is a time traveler from the future, and koizumi is a psychic
<pony_970> Mikuru is from the future, pretty boy is just an extremely gifted psychic.
<pony_970> And we just basically said the same thing. :P
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Shizuka: Ah, I see.
<Golden> Hmm
<DinkyDoo> Back..
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Welcome back, DinkyDoo. :)
<DinkyDoo> I don't think I said ''BRB''..
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, well, yes. Mikuru is from the future. Itsuki is an esper (but was born human). Kyon is the most special of all to her. He spoke to her in class when nobody else would.
<Shizuka> 13aww dammit kyon let the humans a thousand years from now deal with the effects, CHEAT MAN
<twixie_sprinkle> say any chance we could watch cromartie high school some time? preferably starting wednesday next week or later
<Golden> ..
<Golden> Finally
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Okay. Now I understand.
<Shizuka> 13probably best ask sumica
<CurlyQ> dawww
<Shizuka> 13he has more drive space to acquire things
<twixie_sprinkle> okay thanks, its more of a suggestion if we run out of stuffs
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> I'd probably have to watch this show from the beginning in order to fully understand. This is one of the only times I've ever seen this show.
<PrincessCholestrolia> on my iPhone
<Golden> [Alpha] is my old username now I prefer this one
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Sumica: You there?
<twixie_sprinkle> oh yeah, u stream works on iphone, which means stream during class :3
<Shizuka> 13AJIsHaunter|Homework: you were not here for the last three streams last week?
<twixie_sprinkle> *ustream
<PrincessCholestrolia> cant beleive it works
<CurlyQ> lol this is my first time watching this show too
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, the episodes as aired are all over the place. Shizuka's streaming this in chronological order.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Shizuka: I was here, but probably AFK or working on college work.
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter|Homework: you want to ask about cromartie?
<thelonecubone> he's asking about this anime
<CurlyQ> dawww
<thelonecubone> sprunkls
<Golden> ..
<pony_970> I like how he literally said "a bashing /party/".
<twixie_sprinkle> ook
<PrincessCholestrolia> Japanese baseball?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> If I ever did see the streams of this last week, I probably saw short snippits of it.
<pony_970> I think he was trying to imply he would be made into a pinata.
<twixie_sprinkle> man if we randomly started cromartie this week it would probably cost me my finals grade
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Wait, is snippits an actual word? I'm trying to say I saw short clips of it here. :S
<CurlyQ> lol pwned.
<[Alpha]> ...
<Eddmario> Holy crap, since when did Team Rocket have a baseball team?
<PrincessCholestrolia> I would say so
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter|Homework: i think its a word
<[Alpha]> Whatever I'll stick with this
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Ah, I misspelled it. I meant to say "snippets.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> *"snippets"
<twixie_sprinkle> inb4 god gets pissed over baseball and destroys the universe
<TROctavia> I joined in late here.. why are they playing baseball
<oni_link> Eddmario: since that episode they played baseball for pikachu. or am I thinking of Sonic X
<nintendo3ds> XD
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The fact stuff gets warped to a pocket diminsion when ever god gets pissed worries me
<[Alpha]> Hmm
<PrincessCholestrolia> typing on the iPhone sucks
<[Alpha]> Kind of
<twixie_sprinkle> what they need are some bats and balls and gloves with autotargetins systems (i wonder if anyone will get the reference)
<Eddmario> PrincessCholestrolia: That's why you should switch to the Galaxy SIII
<SpadeKyurem[R]> jiggle physics!
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> twixie_sprinkle: I was going to ask Sumi what that anime was where they have to battle in virtual reality in order to upgrade to higher classes in school.
<pony_970> @twixie_sprinkle, Fairly Odd Parents, I think?
<[Alpha]> Oh geez that escalates quickly
<TROctavia> Lmao.
<Eddmario> I take it they're lesbians?
<twixie_sprinkle> pony_970: nop :P
<Anger> *jiggle jiggle*
<CurlyQ> hmm... i sense :( here..
<pony_970> No, wait, Jimmy Neutron.
<twixie_sprinkle> pony_970: yes :D
<pony_970> I knew it was one of the shows on Nick.
<PrincessCholestrolia> my momS phone
<pony_970> And both of them had a baseball episode involving cheating. :P
<PrincessCholestrolia> cheap I
<[Alpha]> I don't like Samsung
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Magic points?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Need more Mana
<CurlyQ> wut is she..
<sonicdude558> ohai
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Fuck
<sonicdude558> what me?
<TROctavia> so this is how they play baseball over there
<CurlyQ> doing..
<CurlyQ> XD
<Eddmario> Kinky
<Kandarihu> So how long have we been using UStream?
<sonicdude558> not very long
<cachikorita01> dat punishment
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter|Homework: well google isnt helping so idk what its called
<CurlyQ> WHOA WUT
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ever since a couple days ago, IIRC.
*Eddmario has no idea what the fuck is playing right now
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> twixie_sprinkle: That's cool. Thanks for looking for it, though. :)
*sonicdude558 hugs his imaginary Twi plushie then ustream
<twixie_sprinkle> np
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, so, since Saturday?
<NullRadix> and then the world was ending because they're losing a baseball game
<thelonecubone> Kandarihu: i think it started out like 2 days ago
<Dark_Horst> whats going on suddenly?
*Eddmario pulls out his imaginary Twilight Sparkle plushie, based on that one Lyra plushie from a couple months back
<[Alpha]> Hey whoever is using an iPhone. I recommend using irc999 it's a good app or chat clients
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ah, now I remember. It was early Sunday, that's when they started using it.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Im waiting for the eventual "panic" when the 21st rolls around
<CurlyQ> frickin commercial just ruined the moment.
<[Alpha]> For
<PrincessCholestrolia> hey look I can use my voice too
<the_real_pony_1604> so are we watching this in chronological order or broadcast order?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I'll just be sitting at home playing Wow and watching ponies
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, ah, okay. Thanks
<twixie_sprinkle> the_real_pony_1604: chronological me thinks
<Kandarihu> the_real_pony_1604, chronological
<pony_970> For those of you new to the series, he was bucking serious. The world will literally end if Haruhi gets upset enough about this.
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: No problem. :)
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[R]: I'll be sitting here laughing at the idiots rioting and all the chaos going on.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i see haruhi and i think i missed an ep of haibaine
<Shizuka> 13and just like that the world was saved
<PrincessCholestrolia> way faster than typing
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> pony_970: Wow. :S
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Wait seriously
<Eddmario> Or I'll just be sleeping in
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The world fucking ends if god gets pissed?
<twixie_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[R]: over a high school game of baseball, yes
<Shizuka> 13yuki, start your hax
<CurlyQ> pony_970: thats pretty scary.
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[R]: That's impossible. After all, how can something get pissed if they don't exist?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Baseball got alot more serious
<pony_970> She isn't aware that she's god. Her teen angst will manifest in disasters related to closed space.
<PrincessCholestrolia> it's like I can talk to you guys
<Shizuka> 13that run
<Anger> oh fuck :o
<SpadeKyurem[R]> HAX
<twixie_sprinkle> hah
<Shizuka> 13>what does that mean
<Buytoast> damn
<Shizuka> 13>HOMING MODE
<twixie_sprinkle> just like jimmy neutron
<SpadeKyurem[R]> WHY IS THERE ALWAYS CHEATING IN BASE BALL!
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Homing mode?
<Eddmario> So, she's a Tohou, whatever the fuck that is?
<CurlyQ> oh dang that bat got bucked up.
<[Alpha]> *lurk*
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Oh, now I see.
<Dark_Horst> "there is a limit to ridiculousness" said the anime character
<Dark_Horst> har har
<Shizuka> 13no no
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> The bat homes in onto the ball, correct?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> I would fucking hate to live in this universe
<CurlyQ> oh god theres a spider cricket... :'(
<Shizuka> 13"there is a limit to ridiculousness" said a character in HARUHI
<SpadeKyurem[R]> A girl who doesnt know she's god has to be happy enough or the fucking world ends
<PrincessCholestrolia> my iphone is going crazy
<SpadeKyurem[R]> This reality sucksd
<SpadeKyurem[R]> *sucks
<twixie_sprinkle> well, at least god is cute
<[Alpha]> Forget this I'm gonna go play Borderlands 2
<SpadeKyurem[R]> HAX
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> SpadeKyurem[R]: It kind of does when you think about it.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: never seen this before, i take it they dont think too highly of logic and physics?
<CurlyQ> im scared..
<Shizuka> 13THE BALL IS HAUNTED
<Eddmario> SO, is it true all the high schoolers in Japan are white and look like they're in their 20s?
<pony_970> Technically the entire universe would end, actually, not just Earth.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> THATS EVEN WORSE
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> pony_970: ........
<PrincessCholestrolia> I can talk in the iPhone so I can type faster than any of you
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: well, your god is a moody teenaged girl who doesn't know she has the ability to destroy the world in a heartbeat
<Anger> this is a riged game of baseball
<the_real_pony_1604> you know, I woner how the people in here would react to watching season 2 if they are reacting this way to season 1
<Shizuka> 13caught the glove, does that mean we win?
<pony_970> Oh Celestia, the Endless Eight.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: well, it's a start
<[Alpha]> Wait...I seem to not care about type speed
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Shizuka: Hazarding a guess but is there a episode where she ever figures out she is god?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Wow. That was a fast pitch.
<Shizuka> 13well i'm not doing season 2, and sumi's not doing season 2
<Shizuka> 13SpadeKyurem[R]: nope
<Eddmario> So, I take it this anime has almost every Japanese stereotype in it at one point?
<Shizuka> 13but now that the plot heavy episodes are out of the way, this series is free tobe crazy
<pony_970> SpadeKyurem[R]: If she ever found out, it would be even worse. She's an immature teenage girl. What do you think she would do with /deliberate/ omnipotence?
<Eddmario> Even, TENTACLE MONSTERS?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Why does everyone cheat in baseball?
<CurlyQ> oh god frickin spider cricket is right in front of me and im flippin out. :(
<PrincessCholestrolia> my end is lagging immensely
<Shizuka> 13and then kyon gave the hax bat to a college team, which then went on to rule the world
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[R]: Because it's fucking hard as hell to play without cheating?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> CurlyQ: Capture it and release it?
<Shizuka> 13nice going kyon
<twixie_sprinkle> man just imagine having a girlfriend that would destroy the universe if you did something wrong
<SpadeKyurem[R]> twixie_sprinkle: So...normal then
<twixie_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[R]: yeah :D
<CurlyQ> Now way.. im a total arachnophobe
<[Alpha]> Hmm sounds normal enough
<Kandarihu> Well the only reason they aired the episodes out of order is because the season ended boringly.
<Eddmario> twixie_sprinkle: Aren't all girlfriends like that?
<PrincessCholestrolia> I want wanna piss her off
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Japanese croque?

<Eddmario> SO THAT'S WHERE THAT DANCE SCENE WITH FEMALE LINK ORIGINATED!
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: The season finale was when she was in that monchrome space of her school?

<PrincessCholestrolia> you're going to love him
<twixie_sprinkle> although i guess she would get to her godly form and kill the universe then anyway
<Kandarihu> AJIsHaunter|Homework, in terms of episode airing, yes. They scrambled the whole thing to save the best for last.
<cachikorita01> what if we are evil and cats are only trying to save the world?
<Eddmario> There's NO way those 2 guys are straight if they dance like THAT!
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Kandarihu: Ah....

<oni_link> AJIsHaunter|Homework: its a story about this dog , google it :3
*aniderp smashes an egg in oni_link forehead

<Shizuka> 13silly rakka you're only supposed to take off running when the guards spot you, then find a convenient bale of hay to hide in
<DrawMotherbucker> Why is there hay in Japan?
<oni_link> lol AC much
<Shizuka> 13hay why not :3
<DrawMotherbucker> THERE ARE NO HORSES IN JAPAN!
<CurlyQ> O.o

<Shizuka> 13HAS THAT GIANT MADE YOU CRY MISS? FEAR NOT! SIR QUIXOTE WILL ASSIST YOU!
<oni_link> DrawMotherbucker: are you daft, what about hay fries?
<FlutterMEDIC> DrawMotherbucker: there were horses in Japan dude
<DrawMotherbucker> oni_link those have only gotten one mention so far...
<DrawMotherbucker> FlutterMEDIC I haven't seen em. Japan is also too small.
<Randomnerd> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mebv9ukODI1r5xybio1_500.jpg
<oni_link> still you can't go and say cupcakes are the official dish
<Randomnerd> Sent to me by a friend
<urquix> 6_9
<DrawMotherbucker> They've gotten more mention and screen time than hay.
<Madviking> lolol
<Randomnerd> So her wing is injured?
<CrystalPhoenix> http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/135404864105.png
<CrystalPhoenix> LOVE AND TOLERATE PEOPLE
<CrystalPhoenix> YEEEEEEEEEEAH
<Randomnerd> Pretty much, yeah.
<DrawMotherbucker> and then the cloppers mock the furries.
<DrawMotherbucker> and the furries die.
<Randomnerd> I've learned to accept Furries, actually.
<Randomnerd> It's just someon's fetish. Bestiality in practice is rape, because an animal cannot give informed consent.
<Sarah_B> hey all
<CurlyQ> hay
<Jmo> I'm sorry, how did this discussion come up?
<oni_link> lol she did it again
<Jmo> Cause it should be dropped.
<oni_link> said hi and left
<thelonecubone> Jmo: by one link
<thelonecubone> true story
<Randomnerd> Well, two links, really.
<oni_link> hiyo Sarah_B
<DrawMotherbucker> No...
<Sarah_B> heyyyyyyyyssss
<thelonecubone> one was an following link tbh
<DrawMotherbucker> No one was trying to start this.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, let's go ahead and not discuss that topic kplz? ._.
<DrawMotherbucker> Randomnerd just felt the need to reply to me and get on his soapbox.
<CrystalPhoenix> I was just mocking about the famous Brony motto which is a complete joke
<thelonecubone> yeah, lets
<thelonecubone> CrystalPhoenix: ikr
<Sarah_B> I just posted on reddit's gonewild. props to anyone who can figure which one is me ;)
<Randomnerd> I figured we were going to have a conversation?
<Jmo> Get out.
<thelonecubone> but you know, idiots and internet
<Randomnerd> Okay, we can drop it.
<StinkomanFan> >Fall down a well
<twixie_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: maybe its a joke for most, but that doesnt meant it shouldnt be followed
<DrawMotherbucker> Jmo me?
<Jmo> Not you.
<Jmo> Sarah_B.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Sarah_B, why would you, like, post something like that here?
<CrystalPhoenix> twixie_sprinkle, common sense should
<StinkomanFan> Oh god, Kokoriko viliage flashbacks...
<DaringDerpy> The whole thing depends on the community, I think. Bronystate has the reputation to be quite stuck up and intolerant.
<CrystalPhoenix> complete tolerance not
<Jmo> Keep that shit to yourself or take it to another channel.
<DrawMotherbucker> DONT TOUCH THE RUSTY METAL YOULL GET TETANUS
<DrawMotherbucker> Fucking ad.
<twixie_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: tolerance is common sense in a way
<thelonecubone> get adblock
<Randomnerd> Bronystate is fine, most days.
<Randomnerd> It's the WEEKEND when things get stupid.
<CrystalPhoenix> twixie_sprinkle, would you tolerate a burglar barging in your house and steal your plasma tv?
<DrawMotherbucker> Or Bronystate can just switch back to the stream that doesn't require me to sit through fucking ads.
<thelonecubone> DrawMotherbucker: get Adblock then
<thelonecubone> pendejo
<twixie_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: tolerance doesnt mean ignoring someone, it just means not hating
<thelonecubone> :>
<DrawMotherbucker> Why is the burden of action on me?
<CrazyHippie> No need to use that kind of language YOUNG MAN
<Shizuka> 13DrawMotherbucker: protip, they all have ads because they are all free services
<Randomnerd> Which stream actually doesn't use ads?
<Randomnerd> This ^
<Shizuka> 13we don't have ads even though we pay a fair amount to keep running every month
<DaringDerpy> That's what I mean, Randomnerd. It's turning into a closed community.
<CurlyQ> Yeah, just like how I completely ineffectively "tolerate" my brother. :)
<DrawMotherbucker> But with the other one I could...you know...skip it.
<DaringDerpy> get ad block and everything is fine
<Buytoast> just get that ad blocker doohickey
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Randomnerd> DaringDerpy: Why should we be tolerant of people pissing and moaning about a Colorblind Casting for Cinderella?
<CrazyHippie> I don't use adblock on this site since I wish to support it
<DaringDerpy> something wrong with the stream? it's laggy and the sound stutters here
<Randomnerd> You can still be tolerant and refuse to tolerate intolerance.
<DrawMotherbucker> DaringDerpy you sound like The Doctor.
<CrystalPhoenix> so basically being okay with it
<Phase4> 00,02CrazyHippie, we don't get any ad revenue :P
<Shizuka> 13< important scene btw
<CrystalPhoenix> let me rephrase
<Randomnerd> Karl Popper explains the logic of that...
<CurlyQ> Randomnerd: wuttttt....
<twixie_sprinkle> Randomnerd: thats selective tolerance, which isnt really true tolerance
<DrawMotherbucker> specifically the 10th one.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Phase4
<CrazyHippie> Phase4: Brb gotta switch it on
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<DaringDerpy> hi Phase4
<DrawMotherbucker> twixie_sprinkle true tolerance is a myth.
<CurlyQ> wt..
<DaringDerpy> let them bitch and moan, Randomnerd
<Buytoast> i won't tolerate you talking about tolerance like that
<DaringDerpy> where's the problem?
<twixie_sprinkle> DrawMotherbucker: only if you dont try to achieve it
<thelonecubone> Hi Phase4 L)
<thelonecubone> :)*
<twixie_sprinkle> DrawMotherbucker: and it doesnt even have to be perfect tolerance, just as tolerant as one can be
<J_E_Smith71> Bronystate is great, may get crazy go nuts on the weekends with all the people just coming in for the new eps, but the regulars and the mods are some pretty fun people. That's part of why I keep on coming back
<Randomnerd> “”Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them...We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.
<TROctavia> my audio is crackling like popcorn
<Randomnerd> -Karl Popper.
<DrawMotherbucker> Okay.
<twixie_sprinkle> DrawMotherbucker: and i mean genuinely as tolerant as can be, without self justification
<DrawMotherbucker> alright.
<CurlyQ> TROctavia: same.
<DrawMotherbucker> U win the debate twixie_sprinkle.
<DrawMotherbucker> I'm done
<CrazyHippie> TROctavia: Turn off the microwave. Your popcorn might be overcooked
<Randomnerd> There, we actually had a conversation.
<twixie_sprinkle> Randomnerd: like i said before, tolerance=/= ignoring, it means not hating and condemning
<DaringDerpy> takes it a bit far, Randomnerd. "be intolerant or else be destroyed." ^^
<TROctavia> CrazyHippie: Ok, i'll go check
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's just me or the audio is stuttering heavily
<twixie_sprinkle> it is TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<DrawMotherbucker> and now the OP is sped up -,-
<pony_970> Yeah, audio stutter is getting bad. Stream keeps stopping too.
<DaringDerpy> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it's the same here
<Randomnerd> Well, if someone's trying to destroy you, DaringDerpy
<TROctavia> Guise, apparently its popcorn thats doing it
<DrawMotherbucker> Why is the OP sped up?
<DrawMotherbucker> I feel like I'm on crack.
<Starlight_Phoenix> audio is a bit crackly and the stream is lagging. please fix
<pony_970> YOU ARE.
<CurlyQ> yes. I am lagging very much so.
<DrawMotherbucker> But I am a bit on edge cus I had two pots of tea today.
<thelonecubone> pony_970: naw, i'm more of a pot person myself :>
<Kandarihu> I'm sad to have to miss out on this now
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: PMV: Inspiration / Curelle de Vil / Day Three: Pain
<DrawMotherbucker> I'm the most into caffeine.
<Starlight_Phoenix> video sounds a bit too fast for some reason
<TROctavia> Yeah, why is this sped up
<DrawMotherbucker> Tomokazu Sugita always talks fast.
<DaringDerpy> if someone is trying, he will find himself destroyed. but this doesn't apply to our fringe groups. neither the cloppers nor these permanent "oh my god spaghetti"-moaners
<twixie_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: yeah the spaghetti thing is more like a "hah im so much better" thing
<DrawMotherbucker> twixie_sprinkle Lets call them the Brony Hipsters
<DrawMotherbucker> the Bripsters
<Randomnerd> I'm missing a joke, aren't I? What's spaghetti got have to do with it?
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<Randomnerd> got to*. Too many verbs.
<DaringDerpy> it's the people who always complain about how embarassing 90% of the fandom are
<DashWithRainbows> Just go to Know your meme, search spaghetti and you'll know.
<twixie_sprinkle> Randomnerd: spaghetti is social awkwardness, often used in regards to brony fans who are doing something that might create an awkwardness around them unintentionally
<Randomnerd> DaringDerpy: Well, there's always something wrong with someone.
<DrawMotherbucker> Open the door get on the floor spaghetti everywhere
<TROctavia> clean it up with sock
<TROctavia> not working
<DaringDerpy> the stream is still flawed
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always open the door...but when I do I get on the floor and walk the dinosaur
<TROctavia> lol
<DaringDerpy> must be an american thing
<DrawMotherbucker> DaringDerpy what?
<DaringDerpy> the walk the dinosaur thing
<TROctavia> Walking the dinosaur?
<DaringDerpy> I don't get it
<TROctavia> well.
<TROctavia> its always been all over 4chan
<pony_970> This is basically life as a professional web designer.
<pony_970> Less hot girls, though.
<TROctavia> when people explain stories in green text, if its all a fake, then sometimes at the end they'll throw in the walk the dinosaur
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Didn't Walk The Dinosaur originate in the UK?
<CrystalPhoenix> is it me or is there audio problem?
<Randomnerd> Meh.
<CrystalPhoenix> or is this some upload speed issue
<TROctavia> AJIsHaunter|Homework: Perhaps
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always pony...but when I do, I pony pony pony pony pony
<Shizuka> 13i get it
<thelonecubone> AJIsHaunter|Homework, do your homework :I
<Shizuka> 13i can't do anything about it
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> thelonecubone: I am. Just came back to see what's on stream atm.
<thelonecubone> ah
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsHaunter|Homework, "Was (Not Was) is an American eclectic pop group founded by David Weiss (a.k.a. David Was) and Don Fagenson (a.k.a. Don Was). They gained popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s."

<thelonecubone> but stiil :I
<Shizuka> 13no it isn't
<thelonecubone> still*
<Shizuka> 13it's vac
<Randomnerd> I adore amazon.com...
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always ship...but when I do, I ship Rarity and Spike.
<DaringDerpy> TROctavia: I've seen this quite a few times. Still doesn't make sense. People find it funny, yes. Maybe only because others find it funny.
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsHaunter|Homework, those guys were the band that did walk on the dinosaur
<CrystalPhoenix> DrawMotherbucker, you monster
<otakon> um what
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> CrystalPhoenix: Ah. I thought they were just taling about the song. It said that the song was released in the UK in 1987.
<otakon> what's going on?
<TROctavia> DaringDerpy: It's a very strange form of rolling
<pony_970> Aaand the stream exploded.
<otakon> the stream is going crazy
<Shizuka> 13just shut up and let me work
<DrawMotherbucker> CrystalPhoenix what's the problem?
<pony_970> Probably got that virus from Haruhi's site.
<otakon> Shizuka: I JUST got in here, no need to be snippy
<TROctavia> DaringDerpy: Not rick or duck rolling, but similar
<DaringDerpy> TROctavia: so this actually is all about it
<Shizuka> 13people have been bitching all episode over an issue i can't fix without breaking the audio setup
<CrystalPhoenix> DrawMotherbucker, I do find the whole spike crush cute but actually shipping him with best pony? Heeeeeeh Yeargh!
<DaringDerpy> break it then
<Shizuka> 13so i am understandably a bit miffed
<pony_970> What issue is that? The audio and stream skipping?
<DrawMotherbucker> CrystalPhoenix you haven't read Like Fine Wine then.
<otakon> Shizuka: I'm sorry but I just walked in and I was asking what's going on in general, the "um what?" was the only thing directed at the stream. Sorry it's giving you issues
<Shizuka> 13the problem is fmle is incapable of attaching to a process like every other stream program
<Shizuka> 13unfortunately every other stream program has no idea what to do with video players
<CrystalPhoenix> DrawMotherbucker, and you haven't read Green
<Shizuka> 13because the last time i tried attaching to the player people complained that the video was too small
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> I was talking specifically about the song Walk The Dinosaur. Someone said it was an American thing and while I can understand that because they're an American band, the song was released in the UK.
<CrystalPhoenix> Shizuka, have you tried up Stereo mixing
<DrawMotherbucker> CrystalPhoenix I'll look that up
<Shizuka> 13this is stereo mix
<Shizuka> 13it means i have to have my speakers blaring
<otakon> Shizuka: bah small video that WORKS is better than video that doesn't work at all I say
<Shizuka> 13because stereo mix applies the system volume control before sending the signal to the input
<Shizuka> 13which means i go deaf for your enjoyment
<J_E_Smith71> And you shouldn't have to go deaf
<DaringDerpy> I'm ok with this. :P
<Randomnerd> Then don't do it. I can read subtitles.
<CrystalPhoenix> woah wait what am I saying
<DaringDerpy> small sacrifices
<pony_970> Um. Couldn't you just physically turn the speaker off or separate the mix volume? I thought both still worked during mixing.
<Randomnerd> (I wish I understood Japanese)
<CrystalPhoenix> I use stereo mix to mixed up microphone and speaker
<CrystalPhoenix> also that song
<Shizuka> 13pony_970: yes which completely defeats the point of audio, and no
<CrystalPhoenix> I can see the headbobs
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> The band is American, but the song was released in the UK.
<otakon> catchy song Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13normally i use virtual audio cable to send the player audio to line 1 which is then sent to FMLE
<TROctavia> Well, I'm gunna go to bed anyhow, so, good night everyone
<pony_970> No, I'm missing the nature of the problem. Isn't it the case that you wouldn't strictly need to hear the stream for us to?
<otakon> night TROctavia sleep well
<Shizuka> 13this takes the player audio as is so i don't have to be deaf with system volume
<DaringDerpy> good night TROctavia :)
<DrawMotherbucker> Good night fellow spaghetti lover
<otakon> pony_970: no audio is kind of pointless even if it IS subbed
<DaringDerpy> I have to get to school in an hour
<Shizuka> 13stereo mix allows all sounds through but at the expense of requiring i have system volume turned up
<thelonecubone> Night TROctavia :)
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> Night, TROctavia.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's interesting how many computers have their way to works
<TROctavia> thanks everyone :)
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always so good night...but when I do, its to TROctavia.
<otakon> Shizuka: could you possible funnel it rhough a headset instead of your speakers for that to work?
<DrawMotherbucker> say good night*
<pony_970> But physical speakers usually have volume controls or power buttons of their own. Shouldn't those be unaffected?
<Shizuka> 13i send it to earbuds
<thelonecubone> hey, who told you to stop working ayejay? :O
<Shizuka> 13thus going deaf
<thelonecubone> :I*
<pony_970> Oh.
<otakon> Shizuka: :(
<pony_970> Then that's different, yup. :P
<Randomnerd> Dang.
<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, do you recall where we heared this song before?
<otakon> Hell my headset is at 30 locally
<Shizuka> 13and as for sending to speakers, that hoses my volume leveling for nonstreams
<otakon> and ITS really loud on my end
<Shizuka> 13which is why i use line 1 for streams
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: I swear it sounds like mario
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always use line 1...but when I do, its for streams.
<Shizuka> 13unfortunately VAC is a shitty program that likes to stutter randomly like that
<Shizuka> 13there isn't anything i can do about it
<otakon> Shizuka: so nothing you can really do about it besides just huh?
<pony_970> If they're earbuds, couldn't you just remove them from your ears instead of listening to potentially ear-damaging levels of sound?
<Shizuka> 13can't restart it, can't exit it, can't modify its settings, all because it's in use from boot up to shut down
<DaringDerpy> it has stopped for now
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always stutter randomly...but when I do, Im a shitty program.
<Shizuka> 13i'm glad you're all grateful you get a stream at all
<DaringDerpy> sure
<DrawMotherbucker> I'm not always grateful...but when I am, its cus I get a stream from the lovely Shizuka :)
<twixie_sprinkle> lul theyre using internet explorer
<otakon> okay all, brb have to download an update for FF
<cachi01|bath> must be the GNAA
<DaringDerpy> she should try yoga
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always use Internet Explorer...but when I do, its because I'm a Japanese high school girl.
<otakon> I'll say this about Haruhi
<twixie_sprinkle> im fine with espers, alien robots, and gods in the form of teen girls, but using IE? this anime is soooo unrealistic
<otakon> I wouldn't be able to STAND HER
<twixie_sprinkle> otakon: but shes cute!
<pony_970> It's not unrealistic, that's a school-issue computer.
<otakon> OH LOOK THE SHY ONE!
<otakon> it's the show's Fluttershy
<cachi01> i dont always use internet explorer. but when i do, its because im high or crazy as fuck
<twixie_sprinkle> pony_970: well good point, although most school computers do have firefox
<DaringDerpy> I use IE because bing is best search engine
<DerpyMuffins> Why are the skirts always shorter than need be?
<pony_970> Depends on your school. My high school never had FF.
<otakon> DaringDerpy: you're drunk, go home
<cachi01> DaringDerpy: HAHAHAHAHAH no
<twixie_sprinkle> bah i hate bing
<otakon> pencil stache?
<AJIsHaunter|Homework> DerpyMuffins: I have no idea. :S
<DaringDerpy> :P
<otakon> she's not meanwhile she can't pull off that look
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Yeah it's no problem at all when its something you can't control over. I hate seeing when people make you get fustrated
<cachi01> i see my ass
<thelonecubone> otakon: lel
<cachi01> how is that even possible
<cachi01> oh wait it is
<J_E_Smith71> cachi01: With a mirror
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always bring a visitor...but when I do, she gets interrupted by a fucking cat.
<thelonecubone> cachi01: you're able to bend that far?
<otakon> wait
<otakon> what did she say?
<J_E_Smith71> Whoa that cat
<otakon> oh God
<cachi01> thelonecubone: just a little
<cachi01> dat boob grab
<DrawMotherbucker> otakon: She said MRREEEEHHH desu

<otakon> AJIsHaunter: bc she's a bitch
<DrawMotherbucker> Nagato is best robot.
<otakon> AND THEN SHE'S STILL HUNGRY
<CriticKitten> So she's got Goku's appetite
<otakon> DaringDerpy: that doesn't look right
<otakon> CriticKitten: except she's not nearly as kind ...
<otakon> did she just
<Shizuka> 13they're in davy jones locker!
<AJIsHaunter> Wasn't the VA for adult Goku the same as kid Goku in the Japanese dub?
<otakon> SHE JUST BENDER TALKED
<thelonecubone> welp, gonna go to bread, night everyone :)
<pony_970> She /is/ a robot.
<AJIsHaunter> Night, thelonecubone. :)

<Shizuka> 13she's an alien
<otakon> night thelonecubone sleep well
<CriticKitten> ...they ARE in Davy Jones' locker. Why are they there? O.o
<pony_970> An alien robot.
<DaringDerpy> good night thelonecubone
<pony_970> At least I'm pretty sure that's what they implied.
<otakon> Shizuka: isn't she a robot though that is ALSO an alien?
<otakon> oh great
<Buytoast> i thought she was just an alien species that acted like robots
<Shizuka> 13she's pointing
<otakon> alternate space that trapped him
<CriticKitten> .....welp
<otakon> THE FUCK IS THAT THING!?
<DaringDerpy> happens in the best families
<AJIsHaunter> otakon: I hear the Japanese version kept his kid voice because he's still kid goku, just older considering his innocence to things.
<otakon> PROHIBITED!?
<CriticKitten> If I were to wager a guess, otakon, I'd say.....the End of Days?
<CriticKitten> Oh.
<otakon> KATYDID!
<CriticKitten> Close enough.
<otakon> GIANT FUCKING KATYDID!
<AJIsHaunter> Giant cricket?
<DrawMotherbucker> HARUHIS A CUNT

<DrawMotherbucker> Wait I was just calling Haruhi a cunt cus she transported them to the desert
<Ponies47> Good night everypony ^_^
<DrawMotherbucker> I didn't see the bug

<pony_970> He /is/ a gamer.
<Randomnerd> Oy.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :) is that a scarab?! :D
<Shizuka> 13that was easy
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
<CriticKitten> wat
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah inb4 SECOND FORM
<Shizuka> 13this battle brought to you by staples
<CriticKitten> But they didn't even DO ANYTHING
<DrawMotherbucker> pony_970 Kyon or Koizumi?
<CriticKitten> ....
<pony_970> The computer club leader. Can't remember his name.
<DrawMotherbucker> He doesn't have one.
<otakon> ...
<CriticKitten> That....
<CriticKitten> Might be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
<pony_970> He was inside that thing, so I'd imagine it was taking data from his mind to create that space, including his love of games.
<AJIsHaunter> PETABYTES?!
<otakon> You're kidding me, bc she DREW something she CREATED an ENTIRE DIGITAL RACE?!
<Shizuka> 13this is why web design is hard
<otakon> okay this chick CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO ROAM
<Shizuka> 13you have to make sure you aren't unleashing eldritch creatures
<AJIsHaunter> It has that high of an amount of Petabytes?
<CriticKitten> Maybe. I have seen some pretty freaky shit in anime after all, have to weigh this mentally.
<pony_970> I know, right, Shizuka? And even if you're careful, sometimes IE will turn it into an eldritch creature anyway, but at least it's usually retarded then.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Yeah, little known fact that one wrong html tag and suddenly Cthulhu's wrecking your shit
<Shizuka> 13what else do you think rendering errors are
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<CriticKitten> It's almost thirty THOUSAAAAAAND?
<otakon> oh crap
<Shizuka> 13IIIII SAW THE SIGN
<Shizuka> 13something something ace of base i saw the sign
<DrawMotherbucker> No
<otakon> SHIT
<DrawMotherbucker> No
<DrawMotherbucker> no
<DrawMotherbucker> a million times no
<DrawMotherbucker> ok yes
<otakon> what?
<DrawMotherbucker> ace of base haunted my childhood.
<texasboykc09> Hello everypony
<otakon> hiya texasboykc09
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, texasboykc09. :)
<DrawMotherbucker> I dont always bring in Kimidori-san...but when I do, it's to ease Haruhis boredom.
<otakon> Okay have ANY OF THEM thought what would happen if Haruhi just... I don't know... DIED?
<Shizuka> 13so now yuki is god
<Shizuka> 13we're so doomed
<texasboykc09> What are we watching
<taoumi> the melocholy of susimia haruhi texasboykc09
<otakon> The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i wonder anyone made a pony ver of the dance... :D to the internet!
<otakon> well yeah technically it's Suzumiya Haruhi
<CriticKitten> Okay, weighed it mentally and I suppose that isn't the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen, so I take it back. It does rank pretty decently though.
<CriticKitten> Episode Eight: Nekkid people
<StinkomanFan> The hell is this show about anyway?
<otakon> well that was random
<otakon> YAY!
<Randomnerd> Whooo!
<otakon> Shizuka: tell me more comedic shenanigans ensue

<Mike> Ah. Haven't seen this show much. Watched an ep or two, wasn't interested.
<DrawMotherbucker> Only reason I haven't watched this is because I cant find it on Youtube.

<Emily_Y> flnflanflnaglneehenentlngielneee
<Shizuka> 13because desu
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 009's manga/writing was done by Shotaro Ishinomori who even wrote and produced the Toku shows still popular in JP such as Kikaider Super Sentai and Kamen Rider,sadly he passed on in 1996-99 due to heart problems :( but i LOVE his artwork and shows to this day :$ there is even an ENTIRE museum in his honor and he won the guiness record for having i think it was over 100,000 pieces of art done :)
<Emily_Y> desu
<CriticKitten> Desudesu.
<Mike> I wish i knew the plot better so i could understand what the hell is going on.
<otakon> Shizuka: don't summon the Desu
<AJIsHaunter> I'm guessing she's sexist?
<otakon> OH GOD THAT!?
<Shizuka> 13desu desu desu desu
<Emily_Y> desu desu desu desu desu desu

<Mike> ITS THE KEYBLADE"S SISTER< SCISSORBLADE!
<AJIsHaunter> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Wow.
<otakon> Shizuka: wait the four of them are supposed to KILL EACH OTHER?
<Shizuka> 13suiseiseki just loves her sisters more than she wants to play the game

<otakon> Shizuka: okay WHY?
<Shizuka> 13because plot
<CriticKitten> EVIL
<otakon> Shizuka: dammit

<HoodyNinja> WATCH IN FEAR AS HE DISSAPEARS
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> NocturnalBlade: ikr :$
<oni_link|egg> k
<Wrek> 05how hard is it

<Wrek> 05hack
<Buytoast> Wrek, it's too alte
<Polydunami> I like that we're watching Jurrasic Park on Friday.
<twixie_sprinkle> yes technically it wasnt a hack
<Buytoast> they'll never learn
<Wrek> 05they simply found the keys to the stream the provider had hid under the doormat
<Shizuka> 13also it wasn't GNAA
<oni_link|egg> got it
<Shizuka> 13they just want the credit
<Metronome> -_(\ ok hijack not hack
<Metronome> got it
<HoodyNinja> Politically correctness
<oni_link|egg> it was a single person right?
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Shizuka> 13who wanted traffic for his own stream
<Shizuka> 13dead serious
<twixie_sprinkle> Shizuka: they also made that virus post with the pony tags recently though, but i know that doesnt rove anything
<Polydunami> And he got his just deserts.
<Polydunami> Did he?
<twixie_sprinkle> GNAA i mean
<Shizuka> 13twixie_sprinkle: completely different problem
<Buytoast> how desperate do you have to be
<oni_link|egg> Ah wow
<Shizuka> 13that was a worm that spread via a tumblr vulnerability
<Shizuka> 13most likely GNAA taking credit for it too
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: Desperate like me when I haven't eaten in 2 days
<Metronome> Wht are u guys talking about?>_><_<
<oni_link|egg> Oh yeah that, GNAA is taking credit for the tumblr worm thing too
<twixie_sprinkle> Metronome: theres some virus posts on tumblr
<Punkie_Pue> Did mips ever respond?
<Polydunami> "It's evil unless I do it."
<oni_link|egg> And I know that wasn't them either

<SkunkTauri> what are mips
<Punkie_Pue> Mips was a stream provider we used
<Buytoast> Miniature Ionized pony Sections
<oni_link|egg> The site has to evolve and adapt so just remember that
<Polydunami> It was hijacked.
<Punkie_Pue> The streamers used
<Buytoast> it's a special stream for the horses
<Shizuka> 13now we use ustream

<Moopy> Hey phase4 did your mouse pointer get bigger all of a sudden?
<Polydunami> What if it was Fluttershy? :O
<HoodyNinja> SkunkTauri: What if?
<twixie_sprinkle> SkunkTauri: well she wouldve gone mad too probably
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twixie_sprinkle: ikr :D though ive seen a bunch of Twixie fics even a Colgate/Trixie that was pretty funny,lol Colgate drop giant toothbrush in front of Trixie and w/ wide happy eyes says "Brushie!" :D
<HoodyNinja> What if spriggles wasn't such a big fan boy?
<SkunkTauri> twixie_sprinkle: she will, but at a slower pace
<twixie_sprinkle> SkunkTauri: why slower?
<AJIsHaunter> HoodyNinja: What's wrong with supporting a character?
<twixie_sprinkle> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeah i dont really read fics that much :P
<HoodyNinja> AJIsHaunter: :3
<SkunkTauri> twixie_sprinkle: she has more control over her emotions and would slow the corruption
<twixie_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: eh im not really that much of a fanboy, i just felt like changing it up
<SkunkTauri> twixie_sprinkle: trixie wanted revenge so she got corrupted faster
<AJIsHaunter> Oh no, Pinkamena. :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twixie_sprinkle: oh 6_9 theres some pretty good ones out there like an amazing Luna fic thats nearly finished that made me almost in the recently uploaded chapter :( but really good
<twixie_sprinkle> SkunkTauri: i guess, altho the final result would be the same, and twilight would be a lot more powerful too and might notve fallen for the trick trixie did
<Lira> pinkamena
<Polydunami> dat Majora's Mask final hours theme
<twixie_sprinkle> Sketch_Toku_Brony: well ive read two fics, wasnt really impressed with them, but im sure there are better ones out there, just dont have the patience for most of them

<AJIsHaunter> Polydunami: It's basically an all vs. one.
<Polydunami> Hmm
<AJIsHaunter> Someone controls the Pony while the others try to defeat her.
<AJIsHaunter> However, the pony/Saxton has a high amount of HP and can kill just about anyone in one hit.

<AJIsHaunter> Night, SpadeKyurem[R]. :)
<HoodyNinja> night SpadeKyurem[R]
<Ryunosuke> i've not experienced ad problems
<HavokPhone> Phase4: Why not twitch?
<Buytoast> yeah, these ustream ads are brutal
<Buytoast> only reason i caved for that ad block thing
<SpeccyRush> Polydunami: what browser you use?
<AJIsHaunter> HavokOC: Twitch redirects people to a different site for some people who can't access the stream on Bronystate embed.
<Phase4> 00,02i got adblock after youtube started making me wait 30 seconds for a 15 second video
<AJIsHaunter> Phase4: WHAT?! :D
<Polydunami> I use Firefox, but never considered getting adblock.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah Fighting is Magic Dash's theme :D
<Buytoast> oh shit, ad block works for youtube too?
<SpeccyRush> maybe now you should cause it'll block that ad type
<AJIsHaunter> Buytoast: Yep.
<Buytoast> well hot damn
<twixie_sprinkle> mozilla adblock even allows blocking separate flash applications
<Polydunami> Is friendly fire on?
<SkunkTauri> i use google chrome
<Polydunami> Seems like that is not the case...
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, thats the other reason i blocked ads
<Sarah_B> go go go go go go
<Phase4> 00,02soo much bandwidth
<Emily_Y> hehehe
<Phase4> 00,02all wasted
<Phase4> 00,02plus it doesnt help when you get video ads, playing, with sound, simultanious with an actual video you want to watch
<twixie_sprinkle> you cant defeat the great and powerful trixie
<AJIsHaunter> G&PT is OP. Nerf now.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so for adblock is it the one for your browser or adblock plus? :$
<SkunkTauri> what song is this?
<Moopy> Its nerf.......or nothing NERF!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Moopy
<Moopy> HA!:D
<twixie_sprinkle> Sketch_Toku_Brony: isnt adblock plus for the browser too?
<AJIsHaunter> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I think both are for your browser.
<HavokPhone> So...
<AJIsHaunter> Phase4: Have you ever encountered any Spy crabbers on TF2? :D
<HavokPhone> I like turtles
<Phase4> 00,02AJIsHaunter, every now and again

<Polydunami> Pinkie Pie is an awesome pony, I'll give you that much. But I still prefer Celestia/Twilight/Rarity
<Chrysalis> didnt know they added Chrysalis to PF2
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> HoodyNinja: i like Sweetie Bell
<AJIsHaunter> I prefer Celestia over Luna, to be honest.

<HoodyNinja> Discord will always be best villian
<HoodyNinja> Discord made tom
<Dr_Fumbles> PFft?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> inb4 Mandark laugh Ha haha ha haha ha ha haha! :D

<JRP2234> Phase4 play with me

*AdamTheDuck slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02magnet boots

<AJIsHaunter> Chrysalis: Yep.

<HoodyNinja> Chrysalis: YUP
<Chrysalis> rather interesting supprise
<twixie_sprinkle> i believe its called training toothpase, dafuq is dat anyway
<Chrysalis> no idea
<jcelios> toothpaste you can swallow I think
<Chrysalis> but its really tasty
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: Training+Toothpaste?
<Polydunami> WHAT.
<Polydunami> TRAINING TOOTHPASTE.
<twixie_sprinkle> ah ok jcelios that would make sense
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man this a crazy match :D
*JRP2234 hugs chat
<Pinkies4thWall> I wish i could play...
<AJIsHaunter> I wsh my computer had the capabilities to play this game. :D
<Moopy> same here
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twixie_sprinkle: 0_o thats horrifying :D
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsHaunter, solution: duct tape + rockets
<AJIsHaunter> *wish
<Pinkies4thWall> My computer is so damn slow
<jcelios> a toaster could play TF2 on lowest settings can't it?
<Moopy> like a turtle
<HoodyNinja> AJIsHaunter: Beat the fuck out of it
<Chrysalis> yu
<Pinkies4thWall> WUBS
<Pinkies4thWall> I liek wubs
<AJIsHaunter> jcelios: Provided said toaster can hold +10 GB and has a decent graphics card and processing speed.
<Chrysalis> also, there are tools to turn the settings even lower than the menus allow
<Chrysalis> There is no computer that cannot play it
<Chrysalis> hell even my old netbook could play it
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, I remember my old netbook.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey the moon!
<Chrysalis> you dont need a good gfx card
<AJIsHaunter> Good times, good times. :<
<AdamTheDuck> Play TF2 without any textures XD
<Chrysalis> just enough storage for all the hats
<Pinkies4thWall> This is a good song
<Malmortius> Guys.. Far cry 3 is amazing. I cant believe the improvement from 2 to 3
<jcelios> o cool a stratch skin rofl
<Phase4> 00,02poor engi
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: i wanna get that! how is it so far?
<Malmortius> Farcry 2 was complete and utter repetitive shit. Far cry 3 is pretty damn amazing. HOW?
<AJIsHaunter> I wonder why the hats cost more than the weapons themselves in terms of purchasing even though the hats are usually cosmetic.
<Malmortius> Its pretty damn exciting Sketch
<jcelios> supply and demand
<jcelios> and crazy people
<Malmortius> Constant skirmirs all over the map. I just ran out of ammo and i had to sneak around and avoid the guys driving around in cars
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: i heard its the Skyrim of shooters
<Malmortius> and then a tiger attacked me ;p
<Chrysalis> wubwubwub
*Pinkies4thWall ROCKS TO THE BEAT
<Malmortius> Stupid comparison, alot of people have been saying that just for convenince sketch
<Malmortius> They're nothing like :l
<Polydunami> Well that was eventful
<Malmortius> Its better to compare to something like.. well, far cry 2 lol
<Malmortius> or just cause
<Malmortius> Great game up to now though
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: ah i see :) well one said that in a review so i wouldnt know lol that and ive never played Skyrim :D but Farcry 3 looks awesome
<Polydunami> Holy crap, look at all these players on the red team
<Polydunami> And they go down quickly
<Moopy> So is that rainbows awesome rock and roll music?
<Malmortius> I think with the comparison to skyrim people are saying, its a giant open world with lots to do. thats about the only similarities
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol they need to make red team ALL Pinkie going "Fun! Fun! Fun!" :D
<Malmortius> And in Farcry 3 they somehow made the funs extremely satisfying to shoot
<Polydunami> Special attack! DRYING PAINT!
<HavokPhone> D:
<jcelios> the pinkie clones kinda creep me out
<HavokPhone> Gtg :c
<Malmortius> Not sure how, they dont have alot of recoil or whatnots. they're just.. super fun.
<HavokPhone> Cya
<Moopy> Hey whats the name of that awesome music i want to look it that up later
<AJIsHaunter> Bye, HavokOC.
<Malmortius> Is.. is that fucking rainbow dash in TF2?
<AdamTheDuck> Bye HavokOC
<HoodyNinja> latas Havok
<AJIsHaunter> Malmortius: You'd be right.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: wow i want it even more~! :D hows the story?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so far anyway.
<Malmortius> I thought i wouldnt like it sketch, but its incredibly well done for an open world. The opening scene has you escapign with your military buddy from slave traders, basically.
<Malmortius> you are a pussy to begin with, lol. your character that is, hes just a normal guy.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: oh yeah! that Vaas guy huh? ive seen previews of him and he sounds all F:[KED up :D
<pony_8482> Hm? I can't hear the stream.
<AJIsHaunter> pony_8482: Check the volume on the embed.
<Malmortius> Vaas is crazy insane. I thought i wouldnt like a character like that, they always seemed forced but with this guy.. you generally believe hes insane lol
<jcelios> like... Joker insane?
<Malmortius> The reason you escape is because after your escape attempt he says "i admire that, now fucking run while we shoot at you!"
<Malmortius> And theres helicopters and dogs and shit chasing you XD
<Malmortius> and your guys like "ohshitohshitohshit"
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: :D thats crazy!
<pony_8482> It's set for Max, but my comp's audio bars only show barely 10% of the audio bar detecting audio.
<Malmortius> Its terrifying and insane
<Malmortius> Cant believe they included a semi-Rpg skill system to it too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> at least killed someone
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Malmortius: did ya see the live action thing w/ the VA? He's like Vaas INCARNATE :D
<HoodyNinja> K, well, I needs some sleeps. Latas Bstate
<AJIsHaunter> Bye, HoodyNinja.
<Malmortius> 3 talent trees, and most of the talents are really, really useful. Like being able to pull around guys after you assassinate them
<Polydunami> Good night, HoodyNinja
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight HoodyNinja
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cya HoodyNinja
<Pinkies4thWall> Malmortius: wait. what game are you talking about?
*HoodyNinja flies away to his bread in the sky
<jcelios> wats with the PHP stuff
<Polydunami> Far Cry 3, I believe
<Malmortius> Farcry 3 Pinkies4thwall
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yep
<Pinkies4thWall> Oh.
<Pinkies4thWall> Carry on
<Malmortius> Cant believe the drastic change from Farcry 2 to 3. because farcry 2 was utter shit.
<Malmortius> Every aspect is improved, especially the story
<AdamTheDuck> God Farcry 2...
<pony_8482> Oh, it was a headphone problem. Not my comp or the stream. Nevermind.
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Malmortius> yep... farcry 2, game that takes 10 shots from an automatic rifle to kill anyone
<AdamTheDuck> That was game was so boorrrring /).(\
<AdamTheDuck> Oi guy, kill this camp for some diamonds, ok now kill this camp for some diamonds
<AdamTheDuck> *Phone rings*
<AdamTheDuck> "Oi help me kill this camp so you can kill this camp easier"
<taoumi> hallo AdamTheDuck
<pony_8482> Everyone here knows about that Mayan Calender thing, right? A family member saw a show about the Mayan Calender in the Discovery Channel awhile back. Apparently more Mayan Calender stuff was found recently. The 'End of the World' calender is actually a calender that leads to the date of a Mayan Ceremony. This was evidenced by more calenders found that function past the 'End of the World' calender.
*AdamTheDuck flips table
<wipergone2> DED
<AdamTheDuck> Dat wall
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Snake!!!
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai taoumi
*AdamTheDuck licks taoumi :3
<Malmortius> Farcry 2 is like, heres a giant world and a gun, go kill some guys. Farcry 3 is like, heres a giant island and a gun and hunting and minigames and high quality combat and crafting and looting and purchasing and exploring. go have fun.
<taoumi> how are you doing tonight AdamTheDuck ?
<Phase4> 00,02looks like i got found

<AJIsHaunter> Hi, MahBoi777. :)
<Pinkies4thWall> I can't wait for the rioting, pony_8482
<Pinkies4thWall> Because it WILL happen
<Malmortius> Finally i think games are mosing away from the muddy, dusty gritty realism shit.
<taoumi> awww that's cute. i'm working on the manes for lunas. the hard part is over now i jsut need to put the pieces togeather :3
<Malmortius> moving*
<pony_8482> Due to a lack of information.
<Pinkies4thWall> Thank god I don't have to work on the 21st
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> pony_8482: really? :D bet those idiots on Doomsday Prepper are kicking themselves in the junk for teaching their kids to eat bugs and what not :D
<Pinkies4thWall> That would be chaotic
*MahBoi777 pokes Pinkies4thWall
<Pinkies4thWall> This thread is now about....
<Pinkies4thWall> MAHBOI
<Polydunami> Air raid sirens on the 21st?

<Pinkies4thWall> Polydunami: ALL THE AIR RAIDS
<Polydunami> Oh hey, MahBoi777

<Pinkies4thWall> And pants
<Engi> You pinged me, is all.
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: awesome lol
<Polydunami> Hide and Seek? What's next, Pin the Tail on the Pony? :S
<Pinkies4thWall> SPOILERS. 12/21/12 is the end of the world AS WE KNOW IT. We will all actually be transported to equestria.
<MahBoi777> EVIL VENT FROG
<pony_8482> I guess I'll join that server. I'm Shadow.
<jcelios> does Equestria have internet?
<Polydunami> I dunno if that would be a good thing or a bad thing. Even though it's EQUESTRIA.
<jcelios> ^depends on internet
<Pinkies4thWall> jcelios: who cares/
<Pinkies4thWall> PONIES
<jcelios> no internet? D:
<Pinkies4thWall> Equestria has PONIES
<Pinkies4thWall> I would think that would be the least of your agenda
<jcelios> I suppose I could live off ponies
<Pinkies4thWall> Frickin' PONIES, bro
<Pinkies4thWall> Why would you need Internet when you have magic all around you?
<RawketLawnchair> If we all did voiped to Equestria, it'd probably be just like District 9.
<jcelios> lol
<Polydunami> Would you be turned into a pony yourself?
<Pinkies4thWall> Polydunami: by the grace of Celestia herself, one would have a choice.
<wipergone2> Pinkies4thWall: u broke it AGAIN
<jcelios> If it meant being able to use unicorn magic I probably would
<Pinkies4thWall> wipergone2: you expected otherwise?

<Pinkies4thWall> Stealth Phase is best Phase
<AJIsHaunter> pony_7268: He's locked into position. He can't move.
<pony_7268> so?
<pony_7268> you can still hit it
<AJIsHaunter> So he can't hit the frog.
*Pinkies4thWall implodes
<AJIsHaunter> Even if he could, it would give his position away.

<AJIsHaunter> Hope we get more AJ and Rarity episode this season.
<AJIsHaunter> If not, maybe later seasons.
<Pinkies4thWall> PUPPY
<pony_8482> I use Firefox. I was told it was better than IE.
<Polydunami> I'm hoping for a more Applejack-centric episode.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #515
<Polydunami> Dammit, I've watched too much LOST. I'm calling them centric episodes -_(\
<twixie_sprinkle> true, we need more rarity and and aj eps, and less yellow horse eps
<AdamTheDuck> Ooooooh, so you're ~CosmicObserver AJIsHaunter :$
<AJIsHaunter> AdamTheDuck: :$
<twixie_sprinkle> huh?
<AdamTheDuck> Now who the hell is Razaza? 6_9
<RawketLawnchair> Fluttershy is a backgroun pony, of course she won't get any episodes
<jcelios> >:(
<twixie_sprinkle> RawketLawnchair: that would be nice
<AJIsHaunter> I'd actually like to see more of the princesses in later seasons.
<jcelios> well considering the whole book thing they will probably play a big role in one more this season
<twixie_sprinkle> AJ's singing VA will be gordon freeman :3

<Polydunami> See you, wipergone2
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: cosmic observer?
<AJIsHaunter> I can see why people love Luna so much, but I don't like her as much as Celestia.

<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: Yep. dA name. :)
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: a ok

<AJIsHaunter> I can understand comparing Celestia to Trollestia as a comedic joke. But when you actually believe that she's a troll princess? That's when there's a problem.

<pony_8482> Or tyr to when the game would not work right.
<xmasskills> derpy let derpy win
<Mutterguy_> hi all
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Mutterguy.
<Polydunami> Hey there, Mutterguy_
<AJIsHaunter> * Mutterguy_
<pony_8482> Derpy's Rage reminds me of the Mushroomization status ailment from Earthbound. Except eaiser to counter.
<Mutterguy_> yeah I think I left my IRC running back on my PC...
<AJIsHaunter> Ah yes, Earthbound. How I love that game.
<Pinkies4thWall|bed> Wait. is phase speaking?
<pony_8482> Yep, I got that when I was a kid. That was when the game was released.
<Polydunami> No, you would recognize his voice
<Mutterguy_> does the voice sound australian?
<AJIsHaunter> What I find stupid is that I was in a bookstore this summer and I found a copy of the game. But they told me that it was "Display Only". :I
<Pinkies4thWall|bed> Kinda
<pony_8482> Well, it is a really rare game.
<twixie_sprinkle> so then eyjey killed them all and took the game, the end
<AJIsHaunter> Well, not stupid. Maybe inconvinient. Poor choice of words there. My apologies.
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: What? D:
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: where did you hide the bodies, huh?? dont think you can hide them forever :|
<AJIsHaunter> But I didn't do anything. ;~;
<twixie_sprinkle> liar!
<AJIsHaunter> ;^;
<twixie_sprinkle> you just confessed!
<pony_8482> I'd donate to that server to be able to choose what boss I'd be, but I'm poor.
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards!
<twixie_sprinkle> [03:31:36] <AJIsHaunter> you're right, it was me all along. but you'll never find the bo- oh, wow, i dont even need to forge this fake confession anymore
<AJIsHaunter> WHAT?! :D
<twixie_sprinkle> >_>
<pony_8482> I find it funny that I do more damage as a KGB Heavy on that server than a Heavy with a Minigun.
<twixie_sprinkle> Liarjack, EF BEE EYE

<Spectre> Do I seriously have the latest time here?
<AppleBloom> Sketch_Toku_Brony: IM SO ALONE!
<Polydunami> Goodness sake
*Sketch_Toku_Brony hugs AppleBloom
<pony_8482> So how much damage does a non crit from Pinkimena do? I was overhealed and died. Normally it takes two hits.
*Spectre yawns
<Phase4> 00,02pony_8482, no idea
<Phase4> 00,02lots
<pony_8482> Yeah, some bosses take atleast two hits to kill me as a overhealed Heavy. Sometimes one shot.
<Phase4> 00,02raven makes for a terrifying pinkamena
<Phase4> 00,02berrypunch y u timeout
<pony_8482> And I heard a KGB Heavy gets a defense boost.
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02so theres a reason berry is dying
<Phase4> 00,02vps went
<AJIsHaunter> Nope.avi XD
<Phase4> 00,02i might need to change providers again
<Phase4> 00,02getting sick of doing that
<pony_8482> Still, I got over 500 damage in before I was turned into a cupcake.
<pony_8482> Anyway, Pinkimena is not that scary. But a mix of Pinkimena and Kinkie Pie would be a REAL terror.
<twixie_sprinkle> is that..spy's arm?
<Polydunami> Goodness, that would be a sadomasochistic nightmare
<AJIsHaunter> Yep, twixie_sprinkle.
<twixie_sprinkle> wow
<twixie_sprinkle> and its all rotten too..
<twixie_sprinkle> and its still moving somehow >.<
<AJIsHaunter> twixie_sprinkle: The scout has a weapon with a fish wrapped in a newspaper. XD
<AppleBloom> Sketch_Toku_Brony: thanks sketch, sorry I would have replied sooner but was playing guitar lol
<afunnypony> ERMAHGERD MUSIC
<twixie_sprinkle> AJIsHaunter: well thats not as nasty

<twixie_sprinkle> yeah like knifing in counter strike i guess
<AJIsHaunter> inb4 one of them Spycrabs XD
<twixie_sprinkle> ive killed so many show offs who tried to knife me
<pony_8482> After a round is over as a Changling, I tend to Spycrab as one.
<twixie_sprinkle> i remember being 1 vs 3 enemies at very close range and they had ak's and one of them got cocky and tried to knife, and when he approached and sliced me i hopped on a nearby boxed and shot ht from there in the head
<twixie_sprinkle> well his slice didnt land i mean
<twixie_sprinkle> and that was your MLG story of the day from uncle sprinkle~
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D

<AppleBloom> MLP movie to be released in the theatres. Good idea or bad? Discuss
<Polydunami> Depends on how well-written it would be.

<Meanwhile> Silent Hill TF2 edition.
<diddutz> So TF2 has rat-maps, too O.o
<AbsoluteZero> AppleBloom, It would be very good to see a well writen and designed MLP movie, but ive always thought of a movie that is made off a series to be used as the series closer or final, so i wouldnt really like there to be one.
<AppleBloom> AbsoluteZero: I agree to a certain extent, but, most other shows dont have a following like this one does.
<AbsoluteZero> very true
<diddutz> 'Tavi :3
<Polydunami> I'd certainly like to see a characterisation for Octavia.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AppleBloom: if i wanted an mlp movie made i would want it to be like Space Jam but 20% cooler :D
<AppleBloom> dumbest pun ever... It made me laugh >.> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5lpxdu
<AppleBloom> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Michael jordan should play as big Mac
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i should pick a boss
<Polydunami> You want to take a stab at it?
<Meanwhile> Guess you have to give up on adventuring now.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AppleBloom: lol i meant the ponies bring Lauren Faust to their world :D but that could work too
<AppleBloom> A wild advertisement appeared *clicks run* You can;t escape
<JRP2234> Phase4 do some old dos game for onestream and recive a cookie
<AppleBloom> Sketch_Toku_Brony: have the voice of bugs bunny be celestia since bugs bunny is best troll
<Phase4> 00,02AppleBloom, terrible pun XD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AppleBloom: oh god i can hear it now :D
<Polydunami> Too bad; Mel Blanc is long dead.
<Phase4> 00,02i was going to say 'Loki v Pinkie pie, write it now' but i've read that one
<AppleBloom> INORITE? it made me laugh though
<diddutz> I still don't understand the Lottery, how can Hot Fuzz be an A, but Brother Bears is apperantly a B movie? How is this accurate?
<AppleBloom> Perhaps have luna as daffy?
<AppleBloom> Trollestia banishes Luna to the moon for 1,000 years "Of course you know.. this means war"
<AbsoluteZero> LOL^
<AppleBloom> OMG PHASE I LOVE YOU. Lyra is my fav background :3

<AppleBloom> Polydunami: perhaps if you helped us come up with ideas, we could make it a good idea
<Polydunami> I would, but I don't remember very much of Space Jam
<Polydunami> Hmm
<Polydunami> So what, do we still have a human basketball player as the main character?
<Polydunami> Or whatever sport we'd have here
<AppleBloom> Polydunami: I dont know o.O What would be the considered sport of equestria? Horseshoes?
<AbsoluteZero> jousting?
<Polydunami> I think there may have been at least one basketball seen in the show

<Gold_Demona> I would NEVER leave something that expensive unattended.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: apparently it's a Bob Ross quote, but it fits Pinkie too :3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i would take and hide in my pocket or something
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she had me watch it
<aniderp|bestcakeever> she lucky i stayed at table with it >.>

<MadSurge> I mean HavokPhone
<HavokPhone> Ik, but not everyone got adblocker :P
<MadSurge> HavokPhone: for Chrome it's free
<CrystalPhoenix> HavokPhone, but everyone should get it
<CrystalPhoenix> it's free for every browser
<HavokPhone> I know >.<

<Zombified_Zecora> close enough
<Zombified_Zecora> aww he overheated
<Ponies47> Good morning
<Zombified_Zecora> Good to you too. Slow day today
<Meanwhile> Hey Wrek do BB's remain through death?
<DerpyCooler> Hi:D
<Zombified_Zecora> hello
<Wrek> 05aye
<DerpyCooler> Whats up;D
<Zombified_Zecora> Wrek's text is in blood D:
<Bronysith> i dont know how i got sick, but im pretty sure Sumica had something to do with it
<DerpyCooler> LOL:D
<Meanwhile> That's pretty sweet actually. Too bad they cost so much to unlock.
<Zombified_Zecora> Alot easier to type here than that stupid iphone yesterday
<Zombified_Zecora> even if i could use speech it was like i was talking to myself
<JRP2234> done
<JRP2234> yay
<JRP2234> done all the 98348903428249 mp3s
<Zombified_Zecora> lol
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354611285847.jpg
*aniderp|bestcakeever noms on candy
<Zombified_Zecora> wow, gilda shows how that is true
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354614773469.jpg
<Bronysith> dem half lidded eyes
<Gold_Dem_> Oh here we go with the 4chan spam
<Bronysith> im done mnow Gold_Dem_
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: reroute
<Zombified_Zecora> It ain't the same image though
<Gold_Dem_> Dangit! It did it again!
<Gold_Demona> There
<Bronysith> dont worry Gold_Demona im done now
<Bronysith> mostly cause i think i gotta puke
*Gold_Demona kicks the client. "Stop cutting my name!"
<aniderp|bestcakeever> candy is goood
<Meanwhile> So what're they going to do with sea monsters?
<Meanwhile> I didn't quite get it.
<Zombified_Zecora> Get eaten if they move illegally off the map?
*aniderp|bestcakeever hugs Gold_Demona
<Zombified_Zecora> I found out that PonyChat lists all the players
<Zombified_Zecora> he's a tank?
<Bronysith> all of the quiet
<Zombified_Zecora> 9 mninutes before I head out
<Zombified_Zecora> gonna get on my shoes
<Zombified_Zecora> You haven't by any chance played Super Filly Adventure, have you?
<Zombified_Zecora> All the characters live happy usually except Luna
<Ponies47> GTG. Bye everypony
<Meanwhile> I wish the TR and VS snipers couldn't shoot in such rapid succession.
<Zombified_Zecora> It seems overpowered?
<Meanwhile> Not neccessarily, the NC guns hit harder but if you miss it means you lose time relocking your shot.
<Meanwhile> Whereas they can drop you in about two quick pops.
<Zombified_Zecora> This is Halo + Star Wars in my opinion.
<Meanwhile> NC snipers are best if they don't know you're shooting, otherwise trying to hit the buggers is a right fuss.
<Zombified_Zecora> And what about the VS snipers?
<Meanwhile> I play NC, so I can't really say how they handle, but they have an advantage in rapid fire. Thing is they don't hit as hard, so it's sort of counterbalanced.
<Wrek> 05^ its the opposite really
<Meanwhile> Every VS sniper I've ever had the pleasure of dueling comes at me with a popgun with much faster shots.
<Meanwhile> It's like being pecked to death by pigeons.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: want some more of the yummy cake me? :D
<Gold_Demona> No thanks, aniderp|bestcakeever. I'm full :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok

<aniderp|bestcakeever> at bronystate

<Gold_Demona> Oh? :>
<MadSurge> h
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: http://i.imgur.com/SpCrZ.png her OC drawn by Momogirl :3
<Gold_Demona> How cute! =D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: she was so happy :)
<Saturn> 08,01had a bit of a river tam moment just now
<Saturn> 08,01my mum was making us some sandwiches, and she had two piles of bread
<Saturn> 08,01she took one pile, and put it on the other
<Saturn> 08,01so i said "it's a stack"
<Saturn> 08,01she looked at me and said "what?"
<Saturn> 08,01i pointed to the bread, "it's a stack!"
<Saturn> 08,01she gives me that sympathetic look that mothers give, "yes dear, it is"
<Saturn> 08,01"you pushed 2 pieces of bread onto the stack"
<Saturn> 08,01"what?"
<Gold_Demona> ohai Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01"if you have another stack", i put my hand out, "you can pop from that stack onto the second stack," start transferring bread to a pile in my hand, "and they'll be in reverse order"
<Saturn> 08,01"what are you doing?"
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Saturn> 08,01bread is now in reverse order on my hand
<pony_021222> inb4 Saturn was kicked from #bronystate for posting 7 messages in under 10 seconds
<Saturn> 08,01"see! reverse!"
<Saturn> 08,01and i put the bread back on the plate
<otakon17> Nah he's a mod
<Zawan> shh! saturn story time
<MadSurge> ^
<otakon17> Also newbie how do you know about that?
<Saturn> 08,01i then start wandering off into the living room, then call back to her "of course, it's more interesting if it's numbers!"
<pony_021222> Zawan: But it's a really boring story.
<Zawan> eh
<Saturn> 08,01go on then
<Saturn> 08,01you tell us a more interesting one
<pony_021222> otakon17: I've seen you get removed by it.
<Saturn> 08,01we're all years
<pony_021222> Many, many times.
<pony_021222> Well.
<Saturn> 08,01pony_021222: the channel is muted and you have the stage
<pony_021222> Alright then.
<pony_021222> This is a story all about how
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when that was incredibly dull?
<Gold_Demona> LOL XD
<HavokOC> xD
<Jmo> Rofl.
<MadSurge> :D
<SpeccyRush> lel
<HavokOC> That's how we handle nubs
<Gold_Demona> That was brilliant, Saturn :D
<MadSurge> Saturn: A+! BRA-VO! :D
<otakon17> Lol
<pony_021222> So I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there.
<otakon17> Wb random pony
<Meanwhile> He was right though, that nearly put me to sleep.
<HavokOC> Ohai pony_021222, welcome to bronystate. Where mods can do whatever they want :D
<pony_021222> Meanwhile: thanks bro, nice to be appreciated.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i went back into the kitchen and said, "it's more interesting if the bread is numbers"
<pony_021222> HavokOC: Tell them I said 'Seig Heil'.
<Meanwhile> I've got to be honest, no one cares about the bread.
<otakon17> It's always about the numbers isn't it?
<HavokOC> pony_021222: k
<Saturn> 08,01so she gives me the 'you are absolutely crazy' look, and says "i don't know if what you just said is something very clever, or somethign very stupid"
<Meanwhile> No one is riveted to their seat with anticipation about the result of the bread story.
<otakon17> The NUMBERS
<Meanwhile> It just isn't very interesting.
<Saturn> 08,01pony_021222: right in the Fuhrer's face?
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I love that song. :D
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: well, no-one else is talking
<otakon17> So Saturn analytical moment huh?
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, was
<MadSurge> Noone's forcing you to listen Meanwhile :|
<Saturn> 08,01otakon17: aye
<otakon17> Dammit
<Gold_Demona> I was interested in the bread story :<
<Saturn> 08,01and then, Meanwhile was banned because Saturn has a massive ego :P
<Meanwhile> MadSurge if you want to kiss ass do it the old fashioned way, on your knees quietly.
<otakon17> Stupid iPod chat won't autoscroll
<Meanwhile> You do?
<Meanwhile> You've never struck me as the egotistical type.
<Meanwhile> An inappropriate weirdo, but never an egotist.
<Saturn> 08,01so you think my rampantly innuendous jokes *aren't* a cry for attention?
<Saturn> 08,01mercy me
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed?
<Meanwhile> It's that self awareness that causes the image to paint itself this way.
<otakon17> Oh lotd
<Saturn> 08,01but maybe it just means i have no modesty either
<otakon17> Lord*
<otakon17> Saturn: You are silly
<pony_021222> I dunno who this Meanwhile guy is, but he seems like a pretty righteous dood.
<Meanwhile> You don't appear egotistical because there's a subtle realisation that you're doing it for the attention.
<Meanwhile> It's a good thing, really. Makes you not look like a pillock.
*AssaultWithEmbraces scoots back on her pillow
<AssaultWithEmbraces> hi
<MadSurge> Ohai AssaultWithEmbraces :)
<HavokOC> Ohai AssaultWithEmbraces :3
<otakon17> Hello AssaultWithEmbraces
<otakon17> AssaultWithEmbraces: Do you know AttacksWithHugs?
<Jmo> Same person.
<Meanwhile> Can't tell if serious.
<otakon17> Oh
<Meanwhile> I hope so.
*AssaultWithEmbraces hugs MadSurge, HavokOC, otakon17
<Meanwhile> Hah.
<otakon17> I
*HavokOC hugs back
<otakon17> I had a moment there
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Silly otakon17 :3
<otakon17> I'm gonna get a coffee
<AssaultWithEmbraces> It basically says AttackWithHugs, just in a, uh, friendlier way?
<Meanwhile> That's your way of making it look friendlier?
<Meanwhile> Clinical terms makes it look sterile.
<pony_021222> It just makes you look like a bit of a rapist, tbh.
<Jmo> Oi. Keep shit like that out.
<Saturn> 08,01next, it will be RapeWithCarresses
<MadSurge> :D
<Meanwhile> MolestWithGropings.
<pony_3045> it somebody say 'rape'?
<Kammerjunk> nope.avi
<pony_3045> oh
<JRP2234> wheres Gold_Demona thingy
<Gold_Demona> Thingy? O.o
<Saturn> 08,01DefileWithCuddles
<Meanwhile> Congratulations Gold, you're a thingy.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Uhhhhhhhhhh
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Saturn.......
<Gold_Demona> I'm a thingy!~ 8D
<Kammerjunk> I belive 'thingy' is the correct term.
<Saturn> 08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: heh, sorry, maybe i got a bit too carried away there...
<Gold_Demona> Yey~ \8D/
<MadSurge> Saturn: oh u
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Great, now my name makes me look like a serial killer. Did not expect that
<otakon17> Lol
<HavokOC> http://phlim2.tumblr.com/post/36874268989/brbshittoavenge-etonia-lessthangrace
<HavokOC> Made me lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Well, at least randomly hugging is better than just straight out stabbing someone in the face with a rusty kitchen knife
<MadSurge> Yes, because hugs are such a terrifying weapon :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I'M A MENACE!
<Kammerjunk> Hugs are the #1 problem in America.
*AssaultWithEmbraces goes into hiding
*HavokOC hugs AssaultWithEmbraces
<HavokOC> :3
<Meanwhile> HavokOC: This is...random.
<HavokOC> yup
<pony_021222> Ponyfags are the #1 problem in America.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Don't touch me, I'm taaaaainted ;`;
<HavokOC> Oooh
<otakon17> Oh
<HavokOC> I sense ban
<otakon17> Oooooh
<pony_021222> And the world, for that matter.
<Jmo> America is a problem.
<pony_021222> ^
<Meanwhile> ^^
<otakon17> And that's you haven't changed you nick?
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of which, I met a brony on the street on the way home today.
<pony_021222> This Jmo guy has the right idea.
<otakon17> Aussie, Brit shut it
<Jmo> How about no?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Awesome, Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> He had purdy crystal toys.
<pony_021222> Kammerjunk: >Bronies
<pony_021222> >going outside
<pony_021222> Well I never.
<Meanwhile> Not without trailing spaghetti.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I go outside with a Derpy shirt, hat and phone charm. No spaghetti anywhere. Just chocolate muffins.
<Kammerjunk> pony_021222: Most of us have orders from the police to stay inside.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And idiot drives
<pony_021222> Meanwhile: Good to know that you ponyfags are aware of the substances you leak from your own orifices daily.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> drivers*
<otakon17> So pony_021222 what brings you here then to a site which is SPECIFICALLY called Bronystate?
*Gold_Demona hugs pony_021222 :3
<pony_021222> otakon17: So I can see what you fags talk about, probably.
<Kammerjunk> He wants to troll bronies, I guess.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Why do I have the feeling that pony_021222 is someone who frequents this place? Or am I losing it?
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, being mad at bronies is so 2011.
*Gold_Demona gives pony_021222 a muffin
<MadSurge> pony_021222 is a silly filly
<otakon17> pony_021222: I'll have you know I'm neither a small bundle of sticks or a cigarette
<Meanwhile> That's right.
<Kammerjunk> I am a cigarette.
<Meanwhile> You're a potato.
<otakon17> I'm a spud...
<otakon17> Joy
<Gold_Demona> lol
<pony_3045> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTW8_PgzMjk
<pony_021222> otakon17: I thought you were a baguette.
<pony_3045> pony_021222, u not tolerate mothef~
<Meanwhile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHx4Xz5Jqo&list=FLCrJ6Rah3q2YaUhrS9gWLcg&index=3&feature=plpp_video
*Gold_Demona tries to ponder the concept of pony cigarettes...
<JRP2234> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9R-SIyCUAIFBFq.jpg:large i did nothing to the menu <_<
<otakon17> pony_021222: :/ how do you know that?
<pony_021222> pony_3045: Say that one more time.
<pony_021222> I dare you.
<pony_021222> I double dare you motherfucker.
<Gold_Demona> How dare you? :[
<Kammerjunk> Double Dare was a pretty good game show.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<MadSurge> Wait a minute... BaconMane?
<Kammerjunk> BaconMane? Where?
<Meanwhile> So, pony_021222, who are you actually?
<pony_021222> Meanwhile: Now let's think for a second.
<MadSurge> ^
<pony_021222> If I was someone you knew, hypothetically.
<Meanwhile> You'd be Elsie.
<pony_021222> What do I gain out of telling you who I am?
<Meanwhile> Nothing, on account of I'm not attempting to benefit you in any manner.
<otakon17> Yeah
<Kammerjunk> ...E-peen?
<pony_021222> By remaining under a cloak of anonymity I'm deliberately avoiding revealing my identity to you to create some kind of aura of mystery.
<otakon17> Meanwhile benefits no one
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile is part of a complete breakfast.
<Meanwhile> It's true, the world would be a better place without me in it.
<Meanwhile> Thanks otakon.
<pony_021222> If you genuinely, really want to know who I am though.
<pony_6699> lol
<JRP2234|Zzz> night people
<JRP2234|Zzz> thingy
<otakon17> Night JRP2234|Zzz
<pony_3045> pony_021222, DONT LET ME SEE YOU ON MY﻿ PONYLAN AGAIN!1
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Night JRP2234|Zzz
<Kammerjunk> Night, JRP2234|Zzz.
<Meanwhile> Lies.
<Meanwhile> You cannot be Tacowiz.
<otakon17> Lol
<Gold_Demona> :O
<MadSurge> Aura of mystery? Where?
<Gold_Demona> Dun dun duuuunnnnnnnn
<Meanwhile> I WILL NOT LET YOU BE TACOWIZ.
<otakon17> Dun dun dun!
<Gold_Demona> Search your feelings, Meanwhile.
<otakon17> You know it to be true
<Meanwhile> Tacowiz is the most unforgivable of chatgoers, but only dari'd be aware of that.
<JRP2234|Zzz> doom2
<JRP2234|Zzz> zzz
<otakon17> Lol
<Kammerjunk> Unforgivable?
<Gold_Demona> Well, Imma go shower. brb peeps
<Tacowiz> Just joking.
<Tacowiz> Tacowiz abandoned bs long ago
<Meanwhile> Of course you are, Tacowiz is dead.
<Tacowiz> As did I.
<Meanwhile> I hate to admit it, but now I'm intrigued.
<Tacowiz> But I've returned.
<JRP2234|Zzz> no stream?
<Tacowiz> And you might be intrigued as to how I know so much, how I seem so knowledgeable about the site.
<Kammerjunk> Go to bread, JRP2234|Zzz.
<Meanwhile> Though chances are if that's true, I probably won't remember you anyway.
<MadSurge> No stream
<JRP2234|Zzz> no stream?
<Tacowiz> Maybe it's because I've been around a while.
<Meanwhile> No, you're lying.
<HipsterBrony> Maybe it's because I'm someone who no longer comes here.
<emangamer> Maybe it's because I'm infamous.
<JRP2234|Zzz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAZDY3b_TG0 look at what i did to doom
<pony_3045> maybe i'm taco
<Meanwhile> Ok Elsie now you're trying too hard.
<MadSurge> ^
<otakon17> emangamer: You're a phony!
<otakon17> Anyway I'm out for now
<otakon17> Bbl, take care
<MadSurge> Later otakon17!
*otakon17 goes to get breakfast
<JRP2234|Zzz> night thingys

<Vivix> damnit.. no love
<Jmo> You'll never receive that from him.
<SpeccyRush> you don't want to live long I figure VioletGreySha
<MoonDasher> So Meanwhile!
<MoonDasher> Take your best guess.
*wipergone2 hits Meanwhile with a large trout
<Meanwhile> Elsie, now you're /really/ trying too hard.
<SpeccyRush> * Vivix
<LordCelestia> Give me your best shot.
<Vivix> SpeccyRush, well, it would be a nice way to go
<AssaultWithEmbraces> http://i.imgur.com/IIoRm.jpg
*JRP2234|Zzz is a potato
<wipergone2> Meanwhile: hey
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: :D
<Meanwhile> You're aware I can monitor the name changes Elsie?
<pony_6699> :)
<Meanwhile> wipergone2: What.
<Gold_Demona> lol
*wipergone2 hits Meanwhile with a large trout
*Meanwhile hits wipergone2 with a brick.
<wipergone2> ow
<Lucid> Meanwhile: Of course.
*wipergone2 dies
<Meanwhile> I have to inquire Elsie, exactly what hallucinogens did you take that made you decide all this was a good idea?
<Lucid> After all, I know you must have a client or are at least using the IRIS IRC, only dumb dumbs use the built in lightIRC.
<Lucid> Meanwhile: Who said I was Elsie?
<Meanwhile> I'm assuming you are, regardless of what you say.
<JRP2234> moo
*MadSurge watches munching on chips
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And again, I lose the memory card for my PS2
<JRP2234> must moo.....doomzzzzzz..zz SuperBrony64 ....is..a...bird...zzz
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: hey
<pony_6699> v
<pony_840009> Hello universe and all who inhabit it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi pony_840009
<pony_840009> How do you change your name?
<pony_3045> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<pony_3045> /nick ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> pony_840009: Use /nick [nickname]
<Lucid> pony_840009: What you need to do is hold down the Alt key
<Lucid> Then press F4.
<wipergone2> lol
<Meanwhile> That is the most legitimate of advice.
<ChaosDuck> No
<ChaosDuck> I know that trick.
<wipergone2> Lucid: lolumad?
<ChaosDuck> I'm not an idiot.
<wipergone2> it closes ur program
<Lucid> wipergone2: Now I am.
<Vivix> Lucid that 'trick' is older than the internet
<Lucid> Mostly because stupidity incenses me.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So is 'delete system32'
<Meanwhile> And yet it does still work sometimes.
<Vivix> Stupid only pisses off the ignorant
<pony_3045> how could u say oOo
<Meanwhile> And it's those times that it's gold.
<ChaosDuck> Well did everyone see the new episode?
<wipergone2> yep
<wipergone2> fuck u trixie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Stupid makes me not want to go back to school for IT and computer science
<ChaosDuck> Did you like it?
<wipergone2> yup
<ChaosDuck> Alright everyone! Goodbye!
<JRP2234> Shizuka go back to bread
<pony_6699> >_>
<Lucid> Vivix: And, y'know, the people who don't like people with the mental age of 7 year olds and find the caps lock key to be the most interesting thing in the world.
<pony_3045> bronystate not talks about ponies, silly
<Vivix> I don't care
<Lucid> Vivix: That much is evident.
<Meanwhile> Well, that was a shortlived visit.
<wipergone2> Meanwhile: lolhi
<AssaultWithEmbraces> '
<MadSurge> So is the troll still here? O_o
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Why are mornings so dull? I hate being up earlier than noon
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi MLP_Brovakiin
<MadSurge> Hey MLP_Brovakiin!
<JRP2234> tom bishop
<wipergone2> O
<wipergone2> :O
<wipergone2> :O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
<JRP2234> whats for lunch guys
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/379771726df3132c506360600820860d.gif that's now how you cat Derpy
<AssaultWithEmbraces> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J79Cdx1-7Mg
<Meanwhile> Shiggydiggydoodad.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Nooo Derpy. Don't hit the kitty
<DaringDerpy> hi bronies! :)
<Saturn> 08,01hi DaringDerpy!
<MadSurge> Hey DaringDerpy!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi DaringDerpy
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya DaringDerpy :)
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: so who was that loser?
<Meanwhile> What makes you think I know?
<wipergone2> AssaultWithEmbraces: is tht on tht server
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Meanwhile> What am I, the keeper of stupid?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: :D
<Meanwhile> Am I the chat's chronicler of idiocy?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> wipergone2, what? I have no clue what you're saying.
<Meanwhile> Do I record every instance of dumb that crosses my path?
<wipergone2> AssaultWithEmbraces: tht pony server with phase4
<Meanwhile> If I did I'd be too busy to say anything.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: we should do so we can guess who's the dumbest troll ever
<AssaultWithEmbraces> wipergone2, I'm not sure. You'd have to ask him yourself.
<Saturn> 08,0115:54 < Meanwhile> Shiggydiggydoodad.
<Saturn> 08,01quite.
<wipergone2> i think its on tht server
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: you could just leave the chat if you don't like it so much
<Meanwhile> You could diggy the shiggy daa doo.
<Saturn> 08,01when it's too stupid in here, i just go to xkcd's irc channel
<MadSurge> Saturn: :< we get too stupid?
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: are we too stupid?
<Saturn> 08,01not you in particular
<Meanwhile> Probably more than you realise.
<Dark92Enigma-> well not according to Meanwhile :D
<Saturn> 08,01but yeha, it often gets vapidly asinine in here
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Episode 10 Synopsis Revealed
<Dark92Enigma-> MUST.....RESIST
<Lucid> I think what Meanwhile is trying to say in as nice a way as possible is that this channel has the combined brain power of a crippled fruit fly with downs syndrome.
<Meanwhile> I wasn't trying to be nice but that's a fairly apt metaphor.
<pony_6699> I
<Dark92Enigma-> hi!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> eye
<pony_6699> +66666666669+-/888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888887,0
<pony_6699> 0
<pony_6699> Sorry, that was my cat.
<MadSurge> Dat wall of numbers
<Kammerjunk> That's why my keyboard slides in.
<Dark92Enigma-> pony_6699 It's ok
<Dark92Enigma-> :)
<LucidDreaming> So tell me, all of you.
<LucidDreaming> What is it about this puerile, infantile little girl's show that attracts you so much?
<LucidDreaming> And more importantly, why do you find it acceptable to masturbate to the protagonists of said show?
<Kammerjunk> I doubt what I say will change your opinion of anything, so it's the little girls.
<MadSurge> >implying every brony finds horses sexy
<MadSurge> lel
<LucidDreaming> Surely there must be some small part of you that hasn't been entirely blocked up with year old Italian food.
<LucidDreaming> Some small part of your subconscious that is telling you
<LucidDreaming> Nay, imploring you, screaming at you that what you're doing is wrong?
<LucidDreaming> Immoral?
<Gold_Demona> Um... wut?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Sorry, I can't hear you over the fact that I don't touch myself to pastel-colored horses
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Kammerjunk> I like Italian food. Not so much the pizzas, though. But they're alright, I suppose.
<Gold_Demona> I return from my shower to find that the topic of chat hasn't changed at all. ¬_¬
<LucidDreaming> Utterly deplorable and more depraved than the entire furry fandom?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I like lasagna. It's delicious
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Gold_Demona :)
<MadSurge> Nope. My subconscious loves FRESH Italian food and ponies, but horses are just cute
<Kammerjunk> Yup. That's me. As depraved as they come.
<LucidDreaming> Furries are understandable, to a degree.
<LucidDreaming> Whilst it's still sickening, the animals the members of said fandom violently pound their prize turkey to at least retain humanistic qualities.
<pony_6699> I don't masturbate to ponies
<pony_6699> lol
<LucidDreaming> They are anthromorphised to some degree.
<pony_6699> :$
<LucidDreaming> And yet with these... horses.
<Kammerjunk> LucidDreaming: It's really your own fault for believing /mlp/.
<MadSurge> >implying furries are just the hypersexualized ones
<Gold_Demona> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ^^
<MadSurge> Disney is full of furries but noone says anything about them
<Meanwhile> Implying /mlp/ isn't a totally accurate portrayal of the fandom.
<LucidDreaming> That is all they are, stylized horses.
<MadSurge> Well DUH
<LucidDreaming> They walk on all fours, they eat fucking hay, they snort, they gallop.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: A big part of it, possibly.
<LucidDreaming> So why is it that they are considered spank bank material?
<Kammerjunk> Hey, I snort all the time.
<LucidDreaming> Kammerjunk: Cocaine doesn't count/.
<MadSurge> Why do you ask us, ask /mlp/
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I wouldn't know where to find cocaine.
<LucidDreaming> >implying most of you don't go on /mlp/
<MadSurge> I don't.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't
<LucidDreaming> >implying MLP isn't an entirely accurate representation of this pathetic cesspool of a fandom
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I avoid the horror that is FourChan
<MLP_Brovakiin> I stay away from 4chan entirely :S
<Meanwhile> I already said that.
<Kammerjunk> I tried seeing what /mlp/ is like. I don't get it.
<Meanwhile> Don't steal my material.
<LucidDreaming> Meanwhile: Good for you, I don't see why you're acting so high and mighty.
<LucidDreaming> You still frequent a channel that these pathetic fuckers dwell in.
<Meanwhile> Wasn't aware I was, don't see why you are.
<LucidDreaming> Festering in their own bullshit and filth.
<Kammerjunk> Somebody's upset.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile is already capable of criticizing us, we don't need someone else :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<Meanwhile> That's true. But frankly I do so because I cling to the vain hope that I'll load it up and it'll be like it was when it started.
<Meanwhile> Alas, I find myself frequently disappointed.
<Vivix> Things always change
<LucidDreaming> Meanwhile: What's the point? Mane chat went down the shitter a long time ago.
<Kammerjunk> Was there ever any doubt?
<LucidDreaming> All that remains now is a few of the original people from the original BronyState.
<Meanwhile> It really did, but frankly you've brightened my day.
<LucidDreaming> Most of the people who made it great have vacated as it is.
<Vivix> Which made it even better
<LucidDreaming> Vivix: You amuse me.
<Vivix> That's the point, isn't it? You're bored, I'm not
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am bored, this download is taking forever :I
<Vivix> Watchu dl'ing?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Whatcha downloading?
<Kammerjunk> I am bored, I can't think of anything to do.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Downloading the new Skyrim DLC o3o
<Vivix> Ah~~
<Kammerjunk> I never completed Skyrim. Did a bunch of side stories, then got bored.
<Dark92Enigma-> there's only two of the original founders left.....NewDCD and Ghosties........
<MLP_Brovakiin> My internet is awful though :c
<Vivix> I thought DCD was gone?
<Jmo> Nope.
<Meanwhile> Both of whom are absent 90% of the time.
<Jmo> Still pops in now and again.
<Vivix> Huh
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Skyrim, egh.
<MadSurge> Nope, he comes and goes
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vivix: He pops in from time to time :)
<Dark92Enigma-> Kammerjunk: /mlp/ =/= MLP FIM?
<Vivix> Ah
<Kammerjunk> Dark92Enigma-: /mlp/ is a board of 4chan.
<Meanwhile> dari is still here, but fuck knows if he pays any attention.
<prince-dari> Hm?
<Jmo> Barely.
<Jmo> Holy shit.
<MadSurge> Ha
<Dark92Enigma-> Kammerjunk: oh. i never go to 4chan, so i don't know how it affects the fandom
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: OOOOOOOOOOH
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: Now you f***ed up! :D
<Meanwhile> Oh you are alive dari, hey.
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Jmo> It's the little pretty princess.
<Jmo> Howsit going dabi?
<prince-dari> Not bad, how about you gaymoo?
<Meanwhile> Tell me Dark92Enigma- exactly how underwhelmed are you by the way that went?
<Jmo> I'm good.
<Jmo> You enjoying running around in a tutu and waving your fairy wand around?
<prince-dari> I'm having an absolute whale jaymoo
<Jmo> That's a good lad.
<Meanwhile> Mayjoo dabi is the best princess, you don't even know.
<Jmo> Oh I bet he is.
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: good question.......when i came down here, the chat was going full speed, because it was basically one of the few streams running. Now that there's like 9 streams, and more people frequent those ones, less people come here, and even with 112, there isn't that much to talk
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: 100+
<Meanwhile> I...was actually talking about the "OOOH Now you fucked up" comment but yippadeedoodah.
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: OOOOOOH. that comment :D
<LucidDreaming> Dark92Enigma-: That's because, and this is an unfortunate fact, mane chat has simply had a rather sharp decline in quality.
<LucidDreaming> It used to be great.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thats a bit rude
<Meanwhile> Exactly, whoever you are.
<LucidDreaming> I know thousands here who can attest to that.
<LucidDreaming> MLP_Brovakiin: It's also a bit true.
<Jmo> The truth hurts.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Fair point
<Meanwhile> Not just a bit.
<LucidDreaming> DId I say thousands?
<LucidDreaming> I meant like, 5 people.
<LucidDreaming> Because those people are honestly all that's left.
<LucidDreaming> goddamnitwrekbot
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: it's because you said ''fuck knows if prince dari is still awake'' and he said ''hm?'' like if he was behind you. and i laughed
<LucidDreaming> But anyway, there's what, 100 people in here? 110?
<LucidDreaming> And how many of these people remember BronyState from the 'good old days'?
<LucidDreaming> I doubt it's a high number.
<Meanwhile> There's about 10 if you count the people who actually say anything.
<MLP_Brovakiin> LucidDreaming: It is still quite early, some people are still in school/work
<Dark92Enigma-> well, yes the mane chat isn't exactly gold nowadays.....but i still love this place
<LucidDreaming> MLP_Brovakiin: That means fuck all.
<prince-dari> Eh, the 'good old days' change depending on when you joined.
<LucidDreaming> What I'm trying to say is, the chat these days is more or less never good.
<prince-dari> Things change, they always do
<prince-dari> And people tend to be averse to change
<Meanwhile> dabi pls, you're obligated to say that because of position.
<LucidDreaming> But this isn't being 'averse to change', Dairy Queen.
<Dark92Enigma-> example, when i joined this place in late-febraury
<prince-dari> So your 'good old days' may differ from people who join now, and will see these times as being the 'good old days'
<LucidDreaming> This is an opinion that is shared by just about everyone else in the same position.
<prince-dari> Everyone else in the same position being people who joined around the same time as you.
<Dark92Enigma-> and by then i guess Hipster_Brony left
<prince-dari> They don't like it as much since it has changed
<Meanwhile> You can't deny that quality of chat has dropped significantly over time.
<prince-dari> Obviously other people find it enjoyable or they wouldn't be here.
<Dark92Enigma-> i found out about him via newsletters, that's how i ''know him''
<LucidDreaming> Princess-Daria, tell me, do you honestly enjoy mane chat now?
<LucidDreaming> Be completely honest.
<MadSurge> I remember when we used to discuss politics and high philosophy, I mean what?
<Dark92Enigma-> Princess :D........please, come on
<Dark92Enigma-> Well Excuuuuuuuuuuse me
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't hope-in-dabiforce.
<prince-dari> Again, that would be speaking from the perspective of someone who was here in the beginning, and has witnessed the place change.
<prince-dari> It's not better or worse, just different.
<Dark92Enigma-> and not just by stream change
<prince-dari> I might have preferred things back in the 'golden days', but that's just me.
<Dark92Enigma-> yeah i agree right here
<Meanwhile> So your answer is no.
<Dark92Enigma-> there*
<prince-dari> I do enjoy it still
<LucidDreaming> That's all I needed, High Commander Darius of the 13th Legion.
<prince-dari> Maybe not as I used to, but I still do.
<Meanwhile> I enjoy it for these brief moments.
<Meanwhile> When it's not entirely bogged down in molten spaghetti.
<LucidDreaming> That's understandable, Darikins.
<prince-dari> BBL
<LucidDreaming> So Meanwhile!
<Meanwhile> What.
<LucidDreaming> And anyone else who's been following this amusing little affair.
<LucidDreaming> Who do you think I am?
<LucidDreaming> Give me your best guess.
<Jmo> I wish I knew.
<Meanwhile> I don't know but I love you.
<LucidDreaming> I'll humour you for a while.
<MadSurge> I repeat, BaconMane.
<Jmo> You seem so familiar, yet nothing comes to mind.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dave the plumber?
<Meanwhile> You're not Sprinks are you.
<LucidDreaming> Come on Gaymoo, Kittywhile.
<LucidDreaming> You can do better than that.
<Meanwhile> Ok now you have to be Elsie.
<LucidDreaming> Hah, I wish I was Sprinks.
<Meanwhile> Or RX.
<Jmo> I really doubt it is Elsie.
<Jmo> He couldn't of become this intelligent overnight.
<LucidDreaming> Actually, it's probably otakon who wishes he was Sprinks, then he could be the one inserting his rugged torpedo into she who must not be named's fluff taco.
<Meanwhile> ...
<LucidDreaming> But I digress.
<Meanwhile> Neil, it's notyou is it?
<Buytoast> oh well i joined at a fun time
<LucidDreaming> So I think it's time I stopped leading you all on.
<LucidDreaming> Meanwhile: Good guess, you're getting closer.
<LucidDreaming> But, I guess I should stop now.
<LucidDreaming> That was fun.
<Sumica> 00,10Oh we going all nostalgistic now?
<Dark92Enigma-> Combustible Lemons?
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Jmo> Wow Neil.
<LucidDreaming> Anyway.
<Jmo> Are you really that bored?
<Meanwhile> Nail you fucking glorious prick.
<Jmo> You fucking twat.
<Dark92Enigma-> bad guess :D
<pony_6699> lol
<Meanwhile> Of course, that's what I would say.
<Meanwhile> If you weren't lying.
<MadSurge> Sumica: save us this chat has gone spoiled :|
<Sumica> 00,10again?
<Dark92Enigma-> i'm not lying :(
<Dark92Enigma-> otherwise i would use this >_> <_< (AND THIS DOESN'T COUNT AS A LIE)
<Meanwhile> Ah but what if you're lying and it does count as a lie?
<thelonecubone> >.>
<thelonecubone> <.<
<pony_6699> 6_9
<AssaultWithEmbraces> ohey thelonecubone
<thelonecubone> Ohai :3
<ScootaChicken> This has been fun, Meanwhile, Jmo.
<Dark92Enigma-> I used the Discorded AJ icon, but i just put them there, explaining in parenthesis that it's uneffective because i just put that disclaimer
<Jmo> Hrm.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonecubone :)
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: but otherwise, it would still be a lie :D
<ScootaChicken> I'm surprised you didn't catch on earlier.
<thelonecubone> Hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Meanwhile> Except we still haven't.
<ScootaChicken> I left a fair few clues: Notice how whilst I was talking in skype as well, I never talked at exactly the same time as LucidDreaming?
<Boltasar> SuperBrony64: I got myself a pro controller, its pretty neat
<Meanwhile> Skype is too quiet, never made the connection.
<Jmo> Go fuck a cactus Neil.
<ScootaChicken> Of course I commented on what he said, but there was always a slight disconnect.
<ScootaChicken> The second clue was within my usage of in jokes and old memes that no one who didn't have access to the skype group would even know about.
<Meanwhile> Well, you pat yourself on the back for a job well done, I have to go lock the chicken coop.
<ScootaChicken> Of course, that would have let you narrow it down to people inside the regs group, which was my intention.
<Buytoast> this is like some warped scooby doo shit
<Vivix> ^
<MadSurge> Except BORING.
<Dark92Enigma-> Buytoast: we need the Scooby Doors now
<ScootaChicken> I was surprised you spent so long dwelling on whether it was Elsie or not, given that my style of typing is fairly different to his.
<Dark92Enigma-> oh
<ScootaChicken> Buytoast: I did get away with it, even with the intervention of those meddling kids.
<MadSurge> Getting away with what? Being an ass? :|
<thelonecubone> MadSurge: wait, what happen?
<Jmo> Nothing happened.
<Jmo> move on.
<MadSurge> ^
<thelonecubone> ah, okay
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Meanwhile> Oh hush MadSurge, play with some building blocks.
<Jmo> What happened in the past hour will not be discussed.
<thelonecubone> dont worry, i wont ask again
<Serenity> Jmo: I missed something retarded didn't I?

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Nah, it's not gonna end.
<MadSurge> thelonecubone: a project about what?
<Brother_Aura> let us watch the pretty slideshow involving fan art!
<Serenity> The chances of it ending is very low.
<thelonecubone> MadSurge: stuff <_<
<thelonecubone> >_>
<Serenity> All that is likely to happen is Yellowstone erupt, which will have a global effect, but not a terrible one
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: they claim it since the start of civilization
<HavokOC> Ohai
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai HavokOC :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: "claaim" And we've had how many false "end of the world" dates so far?
<Brother_Aura> Fi: The chAnces of tHe WoRld enDing is SixTeyThree peRcent
<thelonecubone> Hi HavokOC :)
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: exactly
<AssaultWithEmbraces> MadSurge: eggsactly
<Brother_Aura> If the world was going to end, it would've ended 4 months ago.
<Shizuka> 13actually
<thelonecubone> remember the whole Y/2k?
<Brother_Aura> dumb maims didn't assume leap years were a thing.
<thelonecubone> look at us right now
<MadSurge> Ohai Shizuka :)
<Shizuka> 13the gregorian calendar ruins the mayan calendar
<Shizuka> 13if you take that into account
<Shizuka> 13the mayan calendar rolled over in like 2006
<Shizuka> 13so we've been dead for six years now
<Brother_Aura> I stopped trusting calanderes after mine was a day off.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: :D
<Serenity> Shizuka: That's nice. I'm dead. Thanks for brightening my day
<Brother_Aura> So that's why.
<thelonecubone> So thats means i could do anything right niow? :D
<thelonecubone> now*
<Brother_Aura> It makes so much sense.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> We're all ghosts in an imaginary chat room talking about nonexistant ponies, yaaaaay!
<MadSurge> How are you today Shizu?
<thelonecubone> Yay :23
<thelonecubone> :3*
<Shizuka> 13exhausted
<Shizuka> 13two hours sleep
<Dark_Horst> that would kill me
<thelonecubone> Go to bread
<Serenity> I like bread
<MadSurge> Shizuka: we might get snow soon! *mixture of happiness and road-related unhappiness*
<Serenity> MadSurge: 2010?
<thelonecubone> brb
<MadSurge> Serenity: eh?
<Serenity> MadSurge: You were there, you know what I mean. Us buried in 6-8 ft of snow
<Serenity> Worst snow since the 70's
<MadSurge> Serenity: wasn't that this year?
<Serenity> MadSurge: No, it happened in 2010, cuz I remember all the schools being shut
<Serenity> Especially around North Lincs and Scotland
<MadSurge> Serenity: I dunno, the snow last february was so bad it was almost impossible to go around even on car
<Serenity> Ahh, we had sod-all last year
<Shizuka> 13meh snow
<Boltasar> vee
<Shizuka> 13ours melted
<Serenity> Aorund mid december 2010, North Lincs was completely pwned by snow
<Shizuka> 13wish it would stay that way
<MadSurge> Shizuka: yay for you! :)
<Serenity> Shizuka: So you can get floods?
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Shizuka> 13drainage is good around here
<Buytoast> shoveling snow is nice
<Shizuka> 13snowblower :)
<Serenity> My gramps has a land rover, so we don't have problems with shit-tonnes of snow
<Buytoast> but with a snowblower you don't get to launch the snow all over the place
<Meanwhile> Making a huge snowman is the obvious solution.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> We hardly get snow in South Carolina because we're closer to the Equator, which sucks. I like playing in the snow
<MadSurge> AHAHAHAHA http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ec59310b6d1c661edd8ede8e75657b96.png Swim swim hungry!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> dead

<MadSurge> Ohai AppleBloom!
<AppleBloom> wow chat's quiet, and hello MadSurge and HavokOC
<Serenity> Eww, island keys
<MadSurge> No stream often means little chat activity
<Meanwhile> I'd probably say it's more the time of day.
<Serenity> It's not prime time
<HavokOC> Naah
<Meanwhile> Since even when a stream is on there's no guarantee chat'll be lively.

<Bronysith> cause either way, they are both really shoehorned in
<thelonecubone> wb ayejay
<thelonecubone> :3
<AJIsHaunter> Thanks, thelonecubone. :)
<Sumica> 00,10true, altho a distant friend is a bit more beleavable then an never before mentioned brother
<Bronysith> yup
<Bronysith> but they both just fucking SUCK
<Sumica> 00,10meh I like Cadace
<pony_3045> Cadance is best missile
<AttackWithHugs> I can't even bake pre-made cookies without burning the bottom lol
<AJIsHaunter> AttackWithHugs: I know that feeling. :D
<thelonecubone> :D
<Sumica> 00,10you have the pan to low in the oven if you are burning the botom before they top is done
<AJIsHaunter> I don't mind Cadance and Shining Armor, as long as they expand on their character.
<Bronysith> right, cause they need to focus on 2 recently introduced characters more than previously established ones
<Sumica> 00,10soch a strange combnation
<Sumica> 00,10Space time magic police
*AttackWithHugs sucks at baking cookies. But her porkchops and chicken comes out delicious
<Buytoast> but Bronysith
<Buytoast> the mary sue horse force is the main focus of the series
<Sumica> 00,10funny thing is AttackWithHugs, cooking is an art, bakeing is a science
<LadyCanary> Magic School Bus taught me that, Sumica :3
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: I did not say that they need to focus on them more than others. I said that I wouldn't MIND it if they focused on their character if they got the chance.
<AttackWithHugs> Shizuka, that your dvd of the horses?
<Sumica> 00,10spin off shows for all ponies
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica, I enjoy cooking though I don't do it more of it. I've made a burrito wrap-thing that can count as breakfast and lunch

<LadyCanary> Sith, can you stop linking irrelevant images?
<thelonecubone> and 24 is the skinn guy, that are both friends
<Serenity> Hehe
<MadSurge> Bronysith: clearly nintendo fans are insane
<thelonecubone> they are*
<Serenity> The lorry reversing sound always tickles me
<Kandarihu> thelonecubone, yes.
<pony_3045> MadSurge, that fatty guy with wings is 21 and his friend 24
<Bronysith> MadSurge: no shit
<Buytoast> the problem with that mario image is that the bottom two strayed away from better examples while the top two merely ride mediocrity
<ACS13123> HALO

<Tora> anyone else oozing with nostalgia?
<Stormy> Hey
<Bronysith> ...
<alexxm> zombies?
<Bronysith> woah
<Kandarihu> If Bandai Namco ever wants to get a non-OG Super Robot Wars game published in the U.S., they need to get in touch with Cartoon Network and get the rights to use every single mecha franchise that has ever been on the channel... maybe even Titan Maximum.
<Bronysith> WOAH http://i.imgur.com/l4S17.jpg
<ACS13123> No powah
<LadyCanary> Break everything Coop!
<AJIsHaunter> Break ALL the things!

<ACS13123> Sumica: I like this thing showing what it is being streamed
<Kandarihu> Serenity, and the difference between reading the text on the screen and the text in the IRC is...
<AJIsHaunter> Sumica: I'm guessing people are too focused on the video to pay attention to the title above.
<Serenity> Kandarihu: People are ignorant
<Bronysith> this is one of the best giant mech shows ever
<pony_3045> also Triana reminds me Rose Lalonde c:
<Sumica> 00,10who knew meagas was bigger on the inside
<LadyCanary> Who?
<Kandarihu> Serenity, ... the text in IRC respond to their asking, but not the text on the stream. I guess they're just seeing the text on top of the screen and not noticing that it's the title of the show.
<Dark_Horst> who'S triana?
<pony_3045> Orpheus daughter
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, Dr Orpheus' daughter

<Bronysith> QUICK
<Bronysith> KILL THE MTV satelite
<Kandarihu> My true greatest fear of all is related to Coop's fear
<Buytoast> the only thing you have to fear are dolls
<Buytoast> or being locked in a pitch black room with dolls lining the walls.
<Stallion_of_War> THAT ALIEN ATE SAMURAI JACK!
<thelonecubone> Buytoast: or being with a communist
<weylin|Blarg> THAT MONSTER!

<jcelios> Send in the Big Guy!
<VenHur> Hello everypony!
<AJIsHaunter> ...
<BladedWings> hi VenHur
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, VenHur. :)
<thelonecubone> Hi VenHur :)
<Kandarihu> alexxm|foal, I don't remember the missiles flying in a wild course.
<VenHur> I LOVE this show! As a tyke, I thought it was boring and unappealing to me.
<Serenity> DENIED
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya VenHur :)
<VenHur> ...BOY, WAS I WAS DUMB?!
<alexxm|foal> how are things VenHur
<jcelios> lolol
<Buytoast> keep at it coop
<AJIsHaunter> Punch 'em!
<Sumica> 00,10sadly VenHur many thought that way about it
<weylin|Blarg> You show 'em, Coop!
<Sumica> 00,10it was marketed wrong
<GilDash> I loved this show as a child. I love it even more as an adult. :D
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<thelonecubone> ^^
<Kandarihu> Well 4chan loved it... universally.
<Stallion_of_War> GilDash: (\
<Sumica> 00,10it should have been put in an a more adult time slot
<Serenity> &^^^
<GilDash> Stallion_of_War: /)
<Serenity> This show was mainly aired around dinnertme in the UK
<Bronysith> dem tentacles
<jcelios> so whats the deal with his car being a giant robot?
<ACS13123> Oh shi
<VenHur> Sumica: After I seen Aurtach of Flame's video about this, my opinions about this changed, thus, I'm a fan now.
<ACS13123> He's ded
<ACS13123> No
<ACS13123> They ded
<Buytoast> the end has come
<ACS13123> Wait
<Stallion_of_War> Japan's worst nightmare. A planet-sized tentacle monster.
<ACS13123> Why not just do the robot jesus thing you did last episode
<Bronysith> DIE MTV DIE
<alexxm|foal> Stallion_of_War thats their nightmare
<ACS13123> Keep lookin bro
<Sumica> 00,10next to the ham button
<Serenity> Ham
<Buytoast> gotta have a ham button
<Kandarihu> jcelios, the robot was sent back in time from the future, but it's head was lost. Coop found it in a garbage dump and bought it for $2 and fixed it up in his own style... including a car to replace the head
<thelonecubone> m:D
<thelonecubone> :D*
<Serenity> The buttons were always the best of this show
<BladedWings> fire everything@
<BladedWings> *!
<jcelios> haha thanks
<Serenity> Kandarihu: He never payed the 2 dollars
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I wonder what that "Sorry Bro" button does.
<VenHur> Actually, MTV is a gag in this show, it always appeared as a marketing in any forms before something or someone blows it up.
<Stallion_of_War> $2 for anything in that pile.
<ACS13123> Pew pew
<AJIsHaunter> That and the "Conviently empty building" labels. :D
<VenHur> I guess the producers must of hates MTV...
<VenHur> A LOT.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont know what javascript autocomplete in rails is.
<Serenity> AJIsHaunter: "Museum full of priceless and unreplacable artifacts"
<Kandarihu> I think there was some dispute between them and MTV
<Bronysith> i love Jamies VA
<Sumica> 00,10Because this show was supposed to be on MTV
<AJIsHaunter> Serenity: I never saw that one. :D
<Sumica> 00,10then after they had the deal MTV backed out
<Serenity> It was on Toonami in the UK
<VenHur> Sumica: Holy shit, really? [NBC: The More You Know]
<Stallion_of_War> But then MTV would have good shows on it :o
<Sumica> 00,10causeing alot of issues and stalling the show for many years till CN took it over
<Stallion_of_War> The universe would have exploded!
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Sumica: so its a Take That running gag?
<AJIsHaunter> Oh, this scene.
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<VenHur> Take That?
<VenHur> More like OBJECTION!
<Stormy> Pretty much this http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ with a rails model behind it
<ACS13123> Fak
<AJIsHaunter> Agreed, Coop.
<VenHur> Sumica: Speaking of MTV, they revived Beavis and Butt-Head.
<Sumica> 00,10meh
<VenHur> Sumica: No, I mean, really. I had proof.
<AJIsHaunter> ALL the spikes!
<Sumica> 00,10and i meen meh, never cared for the show much
<VenHur> Oh.
<ACS13123> Lol
<Kandarihu> Suddenly stable orbit
<Stallion_of_War> Ohhright...
<Sumica> 00,10rant
<AJIsHaunter> I wasn't into Beavis and Butthead as many other people were. It never really appealed to me.
<Bronysith> RANT
*Stallion_of_War dat Star Trek parody music
<twixie_sprinkle> me neither
<Stormy> I don't even completely understand it so it's kind of hard to explain =/
<glitchdetector> Can I ask you guys a question?
<Stallion_of_War> Just find the "Destroy Planet" button]
<VenHur> Well, LittleKuriboh liked that show...
<AJIsHaunter> Sure, glitchdetector.
<VenHur> But i'm just saying.
<glitchdetector> I see there is a lot of people watching the stream at almost all times.
<twixie_sprinkle> i dont care for littlekuriboh either
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: He's welcome to like the show if he wants to.
<glitchdetector> What is the reason for that?
<Bronysith> little kuriboh <3
<ACS13123> ENEMY EMP
<jcelios> they are just idling in IRC I think
<Bronysith> the father of the abridged series
<ACS13123> ELECTRONICS ARE DOWN
<glitchdetector> That might be true
<glitchdetector> Well
<AJIsHaunter> glitchdetector: Because the streams are entertaining?
<glitchdetector> Makes sense
<aniderp> hai people
<Kandarihu> EMP Fridge
<AJIsHaunter> :D
<glitchdetector> But hey
<VenHur> We were expecting a bigger torpedo, buuut, that'll do.
<VenHur> [shrug]
<twixie_sprinkle> how does he manage to reverse-engineer future tech so well but not know what an emp is
<glitchdetector> I havent opened my Pony Advent Calendar today
<ACS13123> Here we go
<glitchdetector> wonder what I get
<Bronysith> twixie_sprinkle: mechanics
<VenHur> Did he said...CUPCAKES?!
<alexxm|foal> legit physics
<Bronysith> ...
<Kandarihu> twixie_sprinkle, well clearly he's not going on technology levels.
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: Yep. He stored them in the fridge.
<twixie_sprinkle> Bronysith: he would have encountered electro-magnetics very foten if he were to reverse-engineer such a robot
<VenHur> ...Yup, he's a Brony before Bronies were Bronies.
<Bronysith> twixie_sprinkle: just shut up and enjoy the show
<SpadeKyruem[School]> NEEDS MORE GUN
<jcelios> daaaaaam
<Dark92Enigma-> OH NO HE SAID CUPCAKES everypony panic blah blah blah
<twixie_sprinkle> Bronysith: you could just say "i dont know".
<ACS13123> twixie_sprinkle: Just do it.
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: You can criticize a show and still like it.
<ACS13123> DAYUM
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: he was a brony......before it was cool
<ACS13123> THATS DESTRUCTIVE
<BladedWings> Well that was lucky
<VenHur> MAI GUD, DAT'S TEH BIGGEST GUN I EVER SEEN!
<Mr_Bubbles> HOLY SHIT!
<Serenity> VenHur: No it isn't. *Pulls out bigger gun*
<AJIsHaunter> Because he's a good guy.
<Mr_Bubbles> THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!
<aniderp> how is everyone?

<AJIsHaunter> Coop..... XD
<ACS13123> --"
<LadyCanary> Coop is the most responsible son.
<glitchdetector> I just found a owlolishious i cant spell that in my Advent Calendar
<Kandarihu> A conventional EMP generator is an electrical generator crushed by explosives while running at full-tilt. Perhaps if that's what the EMP torpedo was, he'd be the kind of guy to enjoy cannibalizing something like that.
<glitchdetector> how do you spell that name
<Sumica> 00,10dont do it coop
<Buytoast> no man
<LadyCanary> ...DONT EAT IT

<AJIsHaunter> Hmm. This song is somewhat fitting.
<ACS13123> Sumica: Now we need an episode of ponies and yes this is a troll
<SpadeKyruem[School]> Its more tlerable with better animation
