<fluttercry> 05,15inb4 railings
<Flutter_Shy> I guess
<Eulshy> ugh, this one has been shown already..
<XylemTube> Space Mutiny is best Pony
<DaringDerpy> we had it before
<DaringDerpy> it was bad
<Kandarihu> Space Mutiny is the source of the Railings meme.
<Dashee> I live near stonehenge :)
<Sundaysmile> Time for Railings
<Spazturtle> We've seen this one befor
<otakon> Eulshy: doesn't matter, still funny
<alexxm> well that explains a lot
<RaveBrony> Oh snap :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> i need to go to the bathroom but i dont want to :'(
<Thrackerzod> this show fuck yeah :3
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> fuck peeing
<Eulshy> otakon, not funny, boring
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Well, A generally refers to "really good movies" or "high production movies", while B...not so much
<Pudge> Sergio_Scriptor: you'll have 2 minutes to pick if they choose you
<alexxm> wikipedia
<kirzstryfe> meet the pyro, then after the zoom out use SFM to have him walk into a room to watch tv, and it's shizu intro
<otakon> Eulshy: well then go do something else then
<kirzstryfe> :3
<CrazyHippie1234> ahaha
<XaviortheSavior> Twilight is pleased. :)
<otakon> YES
<otakon> so much YES
<Michael> read all the books!
<Kandarihu> This came out before Wikipedia, right?
<DitzyDoo> Everyone pick the Lorax as A movie
<Shizuka> 13nah i'll cut when it goes to his eyes
<Meanwhile> Maybe you could add your signature over the clip of the Scorch Shot.
<Rainbow> If I get B movie, I'll choose "The Room"
<Pyroid> what if you get chosen and you dont want to talk...?
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: albeit sometimes a B can Be better than the A :S
<PonyStationVita> anypony know how long this movie ie
<PinkieSpice> is this movie space muinty?
<Reikim> A B-movie is Rocky Horror. If you know that movie you'll get the definition.
<PillowPoni> Rainbow: OH GOD
<Pinkie_Brony> SaxyPretender: Oh, okay lol, thanks, sorry for all of the questions
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> durrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<SpiitFiire> b-b-b-brazzers
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Matt> OMG A WHALE
<Flutter_Shy> If we get picked do we have choices or something?
<DitzyDoo> if I get B I pick "The Postman"
<XaviortheSavior> oh hai mike
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no problemo
<otakon> yes yes yes yes yes
<desertman2> Pyroid: You lose your vote
<alexxm> DitzyDoo this was made in the 90's
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it my parents need to get a fucking tolerance for noise
<Shizuka> 13i'm looking through my library now for something suitably shizu like and happy :)
<RaveBrony> This must happen! :D
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen TRIVIA: The making of a Nostalgia Critic episode, is pretty much based off the style of MST3K, Both Doug and Rob watch the movie, They both tell the jokes, and Doug writes down the good ones (that's the basic process, there's more into it)
<Kandarihu> I think I'm going to flip a coin if I get picked.
<linsett> Who wants a Hayao Miyazaki movie?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> foot
<Fisheh_Fish> I like fruit

<XylemTube> Dat IHOP
<desertman2> Bout an hour
<DitzyDoo> OH! The Cat Returns!
<Pudge> I would scream if we get Kung Fu Hustle for B

<otakon> DitzyDoo: it is
<OohShiny> lol
<Doormen> Seems legit.
*Saturn 08,01shouts out to any BUCK staff who have joined us tonight
<DitzyDoo> Kung Fu Hustle is an A movie
<otakon> Sweet_Tea: but Dead Alive IS so bad it's good
<Fl00tersh41> So tortured it's not even funny? Sounds funny to me...
<Shizuka> 13smile smile smile isn't really my thing though
<OohShiny> breaking the 4th wall
<XylemTube> Overdrawn at the memory Bank was also pretty good
<otakon> DitzyDoo: yes it is
<CrazyHippie1234> DitzyDoo: Agreed
<Meanwhile> Eh, that'd look like the Skyrim thing.

<otakon> I'm gonna go look that name up now
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> My jimmies cannot be rustled
<XylemTube> Did't she hate him not too long ago?

<RAWRity> oh hey, I'm here just in time for the 2nd worst ep of the season.

<SteveCharb> RAWRity: in your opinion, what was worst?
<otakon> kirzstryfe: Bay was gonna make them aliens
<Meanwhile> Raphael disagrees.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> he looked sexy in that last bit.
<Barbetos> Berry Punch just wants more alchol
<RAWRity> SteveCharb: Mare-do-well
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> ow

<PonyStationVita> hi everypony
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ninja
<DJ_BR0N3> this is RACIST pinkie!
<EspyLacopa> Ninja Mule!
<otakon> but it still wasn't a great ep
<Apokalipse> Funny, I recall people really liking mare-do-well when it was first shown
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi PonyStationVita :)
<kirzstryfe> mare-do-well kind of beats the point to the ground, not horrible, but gets old
<Darkness_pony> MMM
<Meanwhile> Eh. I was ok with Mare-do-well.
<OohShiny> Ninjas are now cannon

<Darkness_pony> CAT WOMAN
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Hey PonyStationVita
<Obsidian> Hello PonyStationVita
<RAWRity> otakon: I found it boring, uninspired, more concerned with making reference than real jokes, and the pacing was shot to hell. Not to mention how it completely fucks with Rarity and Fluttershy's characters.
<SteveCharb> I like this one for the homages and the alliteration
<Kawaii_icybeauti> joe perry -swoons-
<Randomnerd> Season 2 was not bad. It was a weak episode.
<OohShiny> dat flute
<PillowPoni> Demopan
<EspyLacopa> This entire section feels like Samurai Jack.
<FlutterMEDIC> OohShiny: its "canon"

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03PonyStationVita: Such an MLG name~
<Reikim> I'm sensing another stupid conversation incoming
<FlutterMEDIC> OohShiny: meh
<Pale_Horse> Accusing Pinkie of being ridiculous is like accusing water of being wet. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> and there she goes again
<otakon> they aren't the paragons or perfection
<AlienWarhead> http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=6089251
<Randomnerd> Sorry, let me rephrase. there were no bad episodes in Season 2, but MMDW was a weak episode.
<Tovler> cue the Earl of Lemongrab scream
<Athgaar> "edible"

<IshGirlfriendlesPony> I'm back, are we still arguing about tortoises and turtles?
<PillowPoni> XylemTube: Makes me wish I had sweets in the house
<Reikim> How 'bout we take a gander at the inventive animation? That's the reason I like this one.
<SteveCharb> NNNNNYEH

<Kandarihu> How old is the game now?
<Fisheh_Fish> YAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
<cratorkid> Crippler: id buty it
<Reikim> Other possibility: this entire episode takes place in Pinkie's head. Case closed.
<PillowPoni> I just /love/ how PInkie's mane and tail bounce when she walks
<OohShiny> Troll Twilight
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Smoking bubblrd.
<Journey> 1,11hmm...I wonder if they used coconuts for the clopping of hooves. (inb4 "clopping" joke)
<otakon> Pinkie going backwards and Twi following like "Ugh"
<Darkness_pony> PLOT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*bubbles
<Sumica> 00,105 year birthday
<RAWRity> otakon: yes, people can mess up. But those aren't the characters likely to do that. If it had just been they were saving a special cake for a party, maybe. But this is a cake that the Cakes spent MONTHS working on for a national competition.
<mpoing> woot
<otakon> true
<Sumica> 00,10Journey, are you implying that coconuts are migratory?
<FlutterMEDIC> @Journey: also a Monty Python reference :D
<OohShiny> Trollight
<Fisheh_Fish> Coconuts as clopping noise. Sounds very Monty Python-y
<otakon> no
<EspyLacopa> Poor Conductor.
<Randomnerd> It's a reference.
<Sergio_Scriptor> conductor does not give a fucks
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> it is very monty python
<SteveCharb> other possibility: rarity and fluttershy in this episode are CHANGELINGS
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: would you like a rage maid corset?
<otakon> but does not the Swallow travel abroad in winter?
<Pale_Horse> You know what i love? When shows and novels hide the evidence from the audience so they can seem more clever by "wittily coming to the conclusion" before the readers/watchers can. :|
<Kawaii_icybeauti> FlutterMEDIC: wait what reference?
<Randomnerd> Murder on the Orient Express.
<Reikim> Personally I agree with RAWRity, although not with the same level of vitriol.
<SteveCharb> DUN DUN DUN
<RAWRity> so yeah, no matter how sorry they are, Rarity, RD, and Flutters done fucked up something super important for the Cakes because they couldn't wait a day.
<alfopony> ^really
<XylemTube> I'm really loving Twilight Holmes here
<otakon> Pale_Horse: ticks me off to
<fluttercry> 05,15wait are we talking about how terrible MMDW was?
<Tovler> rum cake?
<DerpStar> Its based on Murder on the Mystery Express
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: the tf2 birthday hats just a cone party hat right?
<OohShiny> Eyelash
<DerpStar> Where everyone did it
<otakon> not really
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kind of bad that clopping means something bad when clop is the galloping and running sound used in the show.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<FlutterMEDIC> Kawaii_icybeauti: have you even SEEN Monty Python and the Holy Grail?
<RAWRity> fluttercry: I'm talking about how bad this ep is.
<Reikim> I'm not going to label anything as best or worst ep, but yes, the whole cake-snatching thing didn't make sense.
<Randomnerd> You all know how "Murder on the Orient Express" ends, yes?
<Darkness_pony> SO MUCH PLOT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: But I'm not mad.
<alexxm> pinkie master of the mood swing
<otakon> Randomnerd: enope
<Reikim> Then I remember I'm watching a cartoon made for little girls and I move on.
<Journey> 1,11Who's Jove?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: okay then
<Kawaii_icybeauti> FlutterMEDIC: Of course I've heard of it, but I never actaully saw the whole thing.
<Athgaar> Zeus
<richfiles> Greek version of Zeus
<OohShiny> too much accent
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: lets give it to otakon
<AlienWarhead> DerpStar except AppleJack
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, it's a dumb expression made by the community for the simple reason of trying to be unique
<XylemTube> Journey: Eve Online?
<otakon> wait give me what?
<Reikim> A cake.
<Darkness_pony> HES?
<DerpStar> AlienWarhead: I meant in the movie not here

<Fez_Quick_Thinker> EVERYPONY LOVES CAKE
<RAWRity> But yeah, there are some eps in S2 that make me bored, or I find underwhelming. This and Mare-Do-Well are the only 2 eps that I honestly feel are just BAD because they don't get the characters.
<Pale_Horse> DID DONE DOOD IT! :O
<Reikim> Plase?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat extension
<Darkness_pony> KNEW IT
<Sergio_Scriptor> >_>
<Deadlypon3> WHAt movie are we watching Nittany_Discord !!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Leave otakon alone.
<Reikim> *Please?
<EspyLacopa> Pink hair!
<Darkness_pony> KNEW IT
<EggWhite> Fluttershy is moulting!
<PonyStationVita> eyup
<DJ_BR0N3> she gonna be hung, like a horse... criminal
<OohShiny> Fluttershy, how could you?
<AlienWarhead> Rainbow Dash is going to need Phoenix Wright again
<Darkness_pony> FS?
<Franek12354> She looks cute
<Randomnerd> It's the Engineer.
<mpoing> :O
<XylemTube> Spy!
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i cant put him in corsets?
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Nittany_Discord buts its too fun to not leave him alone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just wait and see.
<Crippler> FIFTY LASHES
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol DJ_BRON3
<Slowter> Dat them fighting words
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just use the word as you please and if one brings the retarded side of the meaning just tell em how stupid they are
<Deadlypon3> waitin and seeing? That's for wimps!
<fluttercry> 05,15Season 3 better be DAMN good
<Darkness_pony> I LOVE YOU FS <3 <3
<thelonepony> Fluttershy loves trains
<alexxm> same differance
<Reikim> I'd rather we made meme references than started squabbling over the ponies that drew us together.
<Spectrum_Rush> boop
<Bronysith> fluttercry: as long as it has more consistency
<RAWRity> that's another thing. Since when would Fluttershy not only take a bite of the super important cake, but then lie about it AND disguise herself?
<Darkness_pony> RARITY
<OohShiny> I like your style rarity
<Tovler> if I wanted consistency, I'd just watch Breaking Bad.
<PonyStationVita> rarity fales eyelashes
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> yes
<Randomnerd> Oh noes
<Slowter> FALSE EYELASHES!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> rarirty nuuu
<Spectrum_Rush> BALD BALD
<DerpStar> lol
<Kandarihu> Rule 85 of the internet is a go, btw
<Rosfox> xD
<JESmith71> AKR was also going have AJ take a bite of the cake, but it got cut out
<Pale_Horse> I think the bigger issue is that Fluttershy clearly murdered the conductor on duty at the time and threw his body off the train to hide herself. 6_9
<Darkness_pony> DEM EYELASH
<PillowPoni> MY EYYES
<Reikim> Although we have already started squabbling, so instead I humbly ask that we stop squabbling and just agree that ponies are awesome, yay.
<Meanwhile> Oh and I bit the cake.
<SteveCharb> who likes my changeling theory?
<OohShiny> and applejack was going to eat it too
<thelonepony> the horror!
<DJ_BR0N3> Noooooooo Rarity whhyyyyy
<Darkness_pony> NUTS
<EspyLacopa> A little, ladylike bite.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Pale_Horse: he went in her shed...
<alfopony> wat did applejack when this was going on
<CrimsonPhoenix> JESmith71, AJ DID took a bite
<Buytoast> you bitches aint sorry
<Spell-of-Gaming> "little"
<Slowter> The top is still presentable
<fluttercry> 05,15Speaking of Breaking Bad
<SirGanjalf> "We're sorry"
<Buytoast> you just got caught
<Darkness_pony> ITS ALWAYS THE QUIET ONES
<Journey> 1,11Honestly, I thought Pinkie would be one of the ponies to take a bite.
<fluttercry> 05,15HOLY SHIT THIS SEASON IS AWESOME
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yes, Rarity, "little".
<CrimsonPhoenix> she was just smart enough to do it when Pinkie slept
<desertman2> So did I
<Athgaar> hat level up
<PillowPoni> Journey: So did I?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> alfopony: originally Applejack was gonna be involved but they cut that part out
<Darkness_pony> AJ
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> "All my friends were there! ...oh and Applejack too." That line is rather fitting here.
<Randomnerd> It's a bottle episode, and a reference to "Murder on the Orient Express".
<Rosfox> Blues clues
<OohShiny> Incoming puns
<SirGanjalf> Okay, but who's the Kaiser pony?
<OohShiny> and rhymes
<Darkness_pony> BLUES CLUES
<Randomnerd> Don't think too hard about it.

<RAWRity> Randomnerd: eh, not really a bottle episode, considering the entire voice cast is there, there's multiple changes in animation style. "Look Before you Sleep" was a bottle episode.
<Major> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9a6dbcwtJ1rdtot4o5_1280.png
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned self control hasn't been invented yet.
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Warning: Never let Pinkie describe your foods lest ye want them devoured
<Kandarihu> Speaking of Applejack, she's not even here
<StinkomanFan> Then what's the next movie?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, good correction
<OohShiny> dem pinkie bounces
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I was about to correct that
<DJ_BR0N3> "Why cant we have both?"
<JESmith71> And this could have been avoided if Pinkie hadn't tempted everyone
<desertman2> Desserts ruined? Mash them all together!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MMMMMM
<DJ_BR0N3> *everybody cheers*
<Fisheh_Fish> Would eat
<JESmith71> This is you fault to begin with!

<Franek12354> INTERMISSION TIME!!!!! IN 1 MINUTE

<Kawaii_icybeauti> since when was the doctor a judge?
<FlutterMEDIC> NEED EAT THAT CAKE
<EspyLacopa> Extra fancy MMMM

<Randomnerd> Granted, being able to talk up a pastry is a splendid power ifyou're a baker.
<Athgaar> go go pinkie
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> an one moose there get offended lol
<MrBen> And then Pinkie eats the WHOLE DAMN THING
<DrSteveSCARz> Diabeetus
<Spectrum_Rush> OH LOOK Cakelestia
<OohShiny> I want that cake?
<richfiles> Celestia thinks the MMMM is better than sex!
<SteveCharb> care for a diamond?
<Tovler> maybe they should pull a *show only I watch* and introduce like 8 more ponies with flaws to avoid ACCEPTABLE character traits.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wooo!

<richfiles> I got picked once.
<EspyLacopa> I still want to see you guys show Grave of the Fireflies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't really enjoy Over The Hedge since as usual Dreamworks is always trying too hard in their movies
<alexxm> mine were going to be the crow and kung fu hustle
<Fisheh_Fish> Okay VenHur , Mine were Flags of our Fathers
<Randomnerd> So, I'm looking at a new dating site :(
<DJ_BR0N3> Space Jam... shit that sounds fun
<PillowPoni> Congrats Kandarihu
<SteveCharb> idk maybe I'll get drunk and drop by, EspyLacopa
<Reikim> Man, RAWRity, that's quite the hate. Even from you. I'm scared now.
<oni_link> otakon, are you getting this? im just testing out my irc because it says my messages arent going out
<Shizuka> 13Oi, if you want to complain about the lottery, complain to the IRCops, who are responsible for the IRC services that selected our lottery winners tonight.
*Tovler spends his free time mocking other people's poor movie picks.
<otakon> Sumica: Yes, Lord Slug.
<otakon> oni_link: yes
<NocturnalBlade> congrats Kandarihu
<oni_link> alright, thanks
<Dermathil> Shizuka, Chat needs to be put in slowmode
<otakon> WHERE IS MAKER DUSK?
<Yahooz> shit, client lag
<Randomnerd> "alikewise"... It's supposed to connect you to people who read the same books you do.
<otakon> SPAM HIM!
<Reikim> Hopefully we'll at least get another meme out of this.
<JESmith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: So what, do you just pick a random person in the chat to pick the movie? I accidently threw out an A Movie suggestion because I didn't know what was going on
<DitzyDoo> guys y noy just pick from the list posted a while back?
<Tovler> no seriously. I mock other people's movie picks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh back to code
<Yahooz> my bad
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Just remember, Over the Hedge was a Last minute decision since I couldn't pick Hugo, and I wanted B anyway
<Meanwhile> I'll complain to whoever I feel like complaining to damnit.
<RAWRity> Reikim: D-wars is to movies what A septic tank is to swimming pools.
<kirzstryfe> oni_link, the channel was muted, so no messages would have gone to the channel
<SteveCharb> has Good Bad and the Ugly ever been picked yet?
<MrBen> I'm shere.
<otakon> JESmith71: it was random pick
<DitzyDoo> that has plenty of movies
<Spectrum_Rush> i will actually enjoy next weekend
*DerpStar hugs everypony and hands admins cookies
<Meanwhile> otakon this is all your fault!
<graywhoof> imb4 no one leaves the Lottery room
<owloysius> Shizuka: so that would be kabaka, and who wrote the lottery function?
<Dermathil> what did you say Yahooz
<The_Browncoat> 1989 Batman & 1966 Batman for A & B picks.
<RAWRity> the whole Hugo thing was stupid. I OWN HUGO ON DVD
<otakon> Meanwhile: my fault? how is it my fault?
<Sumica> 00,10because that list is like a month old
<richfiles> ^ LOL :D
*Jmo pokes DerpStar
<otakon> The_Browncoat: good picks
<Reikim> Hugo...
<Meanwhile> otakon: I don't know!
<MrBen> I just refuse to leave the lottery room because, heck, I dunno. lawl?
<oni_link> kirzstryfe, oh.. that might explain it but was it like that in the lottery channel too?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The_Browncoat: Ohohoho you tease.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We won't be using this system forever, just so you know :/
<Reikim> I don't think I've seen that one.
<Shizuka> 13it's still too recent

<Yahooz> Dermathil: ure in IRC o_0\

<Meanwhile> Never heard of it.
<Journey> 1,11Oh, I see, all this talk of movies and I don't get a damn thing about my singing. ;_; I hate you guys.
<EspyLacopa> What's the opposite of Christopher Walken?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I like it
<VenHur> The reason Looney Tunes: Back in Action was picked as my A movie is unlike Space Jam, it actually TRIED to be more faithful to the Looney Tunes cartoons.
<kirzstryfe> oni_link, yep
<Shizuka> 13that's a film the MAFIAA will be watching torrents for
<Dermathil> I know rite
<oni_link> oh
<otakon> I'm out of here, see you all in regulars and bronystate
<SteveCharb> IshGirlfriendlesPony: if you loved me you'd have picked the Good the Bad and the Ugly
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: won like, 5 academy awards
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But it was mod pick
<WalkerPony89> IshGirlfriendlesPony: It's a damn shame that you dind't get B movie
<oni_link> thanks kirz :)
<Jmo> Your singing was lovely Journey.
<Meanwhile> Silverscreen: Your singing gave me AIDS.
<graywhoof> You did awesome Journy :)

<ScootaChicken> Hugo is a Martin Scorcese film, so it's pretty kewl.
<otakon> I AM NOT LEAVIN!
<MrBen> Journey: It was quite soothing. That gravely gargle of yours.
<Conyst> What movie is next?
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Thats my second win for A in the past year
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: I don't care about the academy or it's awards.

<CriticKitten> inb4 otakick
<kirzstryfe> D-War is such a bad movie lol
<Dermathil> Otakon, I CAST YOU OUT!!!
<Tovler> I didn't like Hugo all that much. I loved the Artist at least.
<VenHur> Space Jam for my B Movie on the other hand, you all know why. Espectially Lola Bunny...

<MrBen> I got kicked from the lottery room. Oh well. x3
<Yahooz> how about dem middle age lotto techniques
<SteveCharb> Hugo was pretty good, it was kind of meta. Like a movie-lover's movie
<Barbetos> Oh muissed the lottery... Derp. Should of been paying attention to chat XD
<Reikim> There's a program to get around the MAFIAA, isn't there?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat mass kick lol

<WalkerPony89> And why Dragon Wars is so bad?
<DoctoDoctorWho> sigh,
<MrBen> I loved the name. B.S. Lottery. Very aptly named.
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Just rent it on Netflix or Redbox
<Journey> 1,11ScootaChicken pretty much hit the nail on the head.
<Tovler> and what's with the "Too Risky"? Hint: don't download from a torrent with 10,000 seeders. It'll be bugged.
<Pudge> #bslottery is now the mods VIP room
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Music and Film Industry Artists of America is I think what it stands for.
<RAWRity> WalkerPony89: not enough time in the day.
<NocturnalBlade> why so depresses DoctoDoctorWho
<SteveCharb> Apokalipse: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mafiaa

<richfiles> We must construct aditional railings! :D
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> glomps Pillowponi
<NocturnalBlade> *depressed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's basically the RIAA and MPAA combined.
<Spazturtle> Dark92Enigma: Nope, difrent movies tommorow
<MrBen> And not because its supposed to stand for brony state, oh no
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/UAvjY GUESS THE REFERENCE TIME
<Fangrend> cheers
<Apokalipse> Ooh, das nasty
<fluttercry> 05,15They watch for torrents of newer movies
<Dovah> so whats next weeks movies? or have they not been decided yet?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just guess the reference of that pic and you'll win
<MrBen> Dovah: We have.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
<owloysius> CrimsonPhoenix: edo?
<JESmith71> Dovah: We just did lotto
<Meanwhile> Dovah I could punch you in the face right now.
<Reikim> I know I have at least one program downloaded back when SOPA was a big thing, specifically to duck under its baleful gaze.
<DerpStar> Whos waiting till the GW2 launch tonight?
<Jmo> LOL
<Yahooz> People Say the Lotto is rigged regardless of technique /)_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> owloysius, not edo
<Sumica> 00,10sorry waht was the question asked in the room? I missed it when Shizuka cleared the chat.
<Reikim> Unless I deleted that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have MAFIAAFire installed.
<Jmo> Dovah feeling the love.
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: do eet
<JESmith71> Over The Hedge and Dragon Wars
<Tovler> Hell, I just Torrented The Avengers and was safe.
<RAWRity> I've got an HDD full of torrented movie from the last 2 years. Nothing's come of it so fare.
<Darf14> late again *facehoof*
<Dovah> Meanwhile: well fuck you to ass
<Reikim> Yeah, it might have been that one.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Dragon Wars and Backyard Dovah
<Reikim> Well
<Kawaii_icybeauti> da faq is dragon wars?
<Spectrum_Rush> boy that escalted quickly
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> or, well Over The Hedge I guess.
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Good answer. I like you.
<Dovah> DERPDERPDERPDERP: yay answer!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hai SuperBrony64
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just got Last Story
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai CrimsonPhoenix ^_^
<Reikim> The other problem is that Bronystate torrents the movies for showing, unless I miss my mark.
<VenHur> Why Over the Hedge is an A Movie, it doesn't make sense!
<DerpStar> Kawaii_icybeauti: I would presume a war fough by dragons
*Jmo glomps SuperBrony64
<DoctoDoctorWho> cuz I dont know anyone well enough to do that or the related acts of affection without people thinking Im a creeper:(
<PillowPoni> Hai SuperBrony64
<MrBen> SuperBrony!
<Spell-of-Gaming> dat SuperBrony64 :3
<Pudge> CrimsonPhoenix: Cromartie reference?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AFTER 4 MONTHS ORDERING IT
<Reikim> Which is technically very illegal.
<Dermathil> Dovah: watch the language.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MAFIAAFire gets around copyright ban lists, so it probably was.
<Obsidian> Ohi SuperBrony64
<Dermathil> Keep it PG.
<DrSteveSCARz> VenHur: It was a really good movie
<Conyst> Dragon Wars is strange to say the least.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pudge, congratulation my good sir
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's illegal to stream them.
<CrimsonPhoenix> You win NOTHING
<Dovah> Meanwhile: um good for me?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it was fun
<Pudge> CrimsonPhoenix: GOOD DAY SIR
<Eulshy> Doesn't matter if the lottery is rigged or not, i can find a reason to complain about it everytime
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I can see god through Derpy's eyes...
<Dovah> Dermathil: I didnt see the mods complain...
<RaveBrony> Is there a reason why no one is on TF2 server? Kinda scares me when im on and no one else is |:
<CrimsonPhoenix> at least someone knows about that weird anime
<VenHur> I hate Dreamwork's movies, the only decent ones I like was Shrek 1 and 2, El Dorado, Sprit, Antz, and that's it.
<Tovler> I did get caught downloading Avatar. I deserved it since it was searching for a NTSC version of the movie.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> my team won "most improved" at camp..I died inside a little.
<SteveCharb> streaming is more of a challenge than downloading
<Reikim> So that could possibly put BState at additional risk.
<Kandarihu> Oh, we're not banned from the Slottery channel
<RAWRity> Reikim: yes, but that would be an issue with the stream provider, not the torrent itself.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Spell-of-Gaming O.O
<Buytoast> everyone bitches about the lottery
<Malk> What are we watching? I fell asleep
<JESmith71> Oh and Journey I did notice you randomly singing in here during the lotto but I don't know the song
<VenHur> THAT'S. IT.
*NocturnalBlade hugs DoctoDoctorWho "dont worry, i barely know you or anyone here but i will hug them when they feel down" ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, How to train a Dragon
<PonyStationVita> my lottery crashed
<Shizuka> 13thing is we don't have a great many people available to run movie nights
<RAWRity> Reikim: and a risk they'd be taking anyway with regular streaming.
<VenHur> CrimsonPhoenix: Haven't watched that one yet.
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 toot spam

<Fez_Quick_Thinker> ITS MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 6 PONIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Kurra> Will Smith I like your patterns.
<otakon> RAWRity: on a scale of 1 to Snookie, Jersey Shore
<ScootaChicken> Like Justin Beiber's Never Say Never dohohohoho
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> is this Rifftrax or MST3K?
<Spectrum_Rush> Scoot-Scootaloo: FUCK YEAH
<DerpStar> Is it going to be commentated the whole time :S
<Fisheh_Fish> I love rifftrax :3
<Darf14> movie time :)
<Pale_Horse> Taking a awesome sci-fi movie and making it even more awesome by riffing it. :D
<thelonepony> Love RiffTrax
<otakon> it's Rifftrax
<Deadlypon3> Scoot-Scootaloo What was the last movie?
<JESmith71> Oh the Rifftrax. Didn't think we'd have someone else but Shizuka stream it
<richfiles> Wat is this??? ID without seriousness! :D
<VenHur> Will Smith + Rifftrax = ME MUCHO GUSTA
<Slowter> What the heck is blowing the dust?
<otakon> this is past MST3K's airing
<Dark92BETRAYED> aND.........what about BOOMER!?
<DerpStar> The vulcans came in peace just saying
<Slowter> The moon has no atmosphere
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hahah blowing the dust
<WalkerPony89> IshGirlfriendlesPony: Rifftrax methinks
<JESmith71> The riffing continues
<Will_Smith> 1,11I have so much swag, I was just given a hundred dollars and called a Fresh Prince.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03it wasn't American, that much I can tell Deadlypon3 >: (
<SpeedyBolt> OH GOD THE SHADOW
<Dermathil> So that's Independence day, but in Rifftrax?
<otakon> Dark92BETRAYED: HE WILL LIVE!
<SteveCharb> moonshadow rofl
<Dark92BETRAYED> Moonshadow........moonshadow
<otakon> OHGOD ITS ROSIE!
<PonyStationVita> this defies the physics of there being wind in space
<Kandarihu> Okay. I never watched this movie. This is a horribly awkward moment. My mom is watching, and I REALLY don't want to watch it like this before I watch it unriffed.
<Meanwhile> Sigh. Oh well. Better luck next week.
<otakon> GIVE HER PIE!
<Deadlypon3> Scoot-Scootaloo GODDAMN IT
<Dark92BETRAYED> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
<JESmith71> Now I see the theme tonight. Mike and the gang riffing on two sci-fi films
<otakon> Kandarihu: just watch and laugh
<Dermathil> I missed the beginning of the movie last year.
<VenHur> No Boomer Spoilers, we haven't got to that part.
<SpeedyBolt> Because incest.
<ScootaChicken> MeanwhileL I think we need to accept that we're both never going to win anything.
<FlutterMEDIC> big thang
<Fisheh_Fish> Assume
<OohShiny> lol
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: see, THAT'S grey area. Not well recieved on IMDB, but met with middling reception by critics on RT. Decent sized budget of 15 mil. Likely an A, but Beiber hatred made everyone scream B.
<Meanwhile> Shut up and let me dream you bangkok prostitute.
<oni_link> Shizuka: um if you're not busy and if its not a hastle... could you tell me if this desktop kit is worth getting? Thats if you want to. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3859884&Sku=B69-0592&cm_re=Homepage-_-Spot 01c-_-CatId_31_B69-0592
<Malk> Its my birthday
<Shizuka> 13i don't advise on tech
<Shizuka> 13never had the money to build myself
<SpeedyBolt> ITS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW
<VenHur> Space, it's as big what it seem-HAWLY SHEET! A GIANT UFO! NARRATOR OUTTA HERE!
<OohShiny> minigolf!
<Kandarihu> At the very least, I'd rather watch it normally before I watch it riffed. But my mom watched it before unriffed and enjoyed it.
<Darf14> Rifftrax makes everything better
<owloysius> leeroy jenkins
<JESmith71> Heh the ponies down there are doing their best impressions of Mike, Bill, and Kevin's voices
<OohShiny> commented movies tonight
<Reikim> I'd pin Bieber as an A for budget.
<Pale_Horse> When you make assumptions You make an "ass" out of "U" and "mptions". :D
<oni_link> Shizuka: oh okay then
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Inderpendence Day 6_9
<SpeedyBolt> HA
<Pudge> I LOVE independence day
<WalkerPony89> Seems more like an A too
<RAWRity> And by the gods, If I ever win A or B, I'll make my case for either one. I WILL make you fuckers watch that.
<Pudge> how could they possibly rifftrax it
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> at this point I don't care if mother figures out Imma brony, I have bigger secret to hide from people
<owloysius> these wubs are the sound we're looking for!:D
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i hated it
<Reikim> Big, hyped, didn't fail spectacularly...pretty much an A.
<ScootaChicken> I would vote for Beiber as A, but that spot's reserved for Fight Club.
<VenHur> We really need a Mystery Equestrian Theather series, WHOS WITH ME?
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> she already suspects it anyway
<WalkerPony89> RAWRity: Why do you hate us?
<fluttercry> 05,15Pudge sometimes they riff things they like
<SteveCharb> Elvis was a much better actor than Beiber
<FlutterMEDIC> I'M WITH YOU
<Dark92BETRAYED> VenHur: /)
<Conyst> They can rifftrax anything.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Watch what?
<NocturnalBlade> VenHur: i second this
<DerpStar> He was in Stargate right?
<MrBen> VenHur: YES
<Jmo> oni_link: What are you using it for?
<Sumica> 00,10if only I could animate them
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i think someones already done it
<DerpStar> The movie
<SteveCharb> and singer
<owloysius> so we have audio, rifftrax, and chat. i can't multitask this.
<SteveCharb> and person
<CriticKitten> :O
<Will_Smith> 1,11NOOOO! LUNA!
<hen3ry> Luna.
<Crippler> ohhhh
<ScootaChicken> And I don't want to risk putting Fight Club as a B and then having the mods go 'Oh no, it's an A movie, we ain't watching that yo.'
<Tovler> I'm not wasting my first movie ever on Bieber
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> and species
<Darf14> lol
<CriticKitten> Luna's betrayed us? ;_;
<Dark92BETRAYED> Fez_Quick_Thinker: WHO?
<Meanwhile> But who was Moon?
<Will_Smith> 1,11BOOM!
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: are they supposed to be animated?
<VenHur> Dark92BETRAYED: (\
<Dark92BETRAYED> LUNA????????
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> blow up the previous scene
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> no clue
<Sumica> 00,10no
<alexxm> it's the nazis
<Conyst> No not inside the house.
<richfiles> Michael Bay does scene ransistions
<AlienWarhead> owloysious all we need now are subtitles
<RAWRity> WalkerPony89: more I just hate the internet's knee-jerk reaction to Bieber, and the transphobis shit they spew everytime he comes up. This way I can at least enjoy people squirm.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Attack of the Static from outer space?
<WalkerPony89> IshGirlfriendlesPony: Who cares that she knows as long as she won't do anything to restrict your poni viewing
<cratorkid> alexxm: love iron sky
<Sumica> 00,10it's just stills
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Lightbright
<Conyst> and a map
<alexxm> cratorkid i know right
<oni_link> Jmo: hopefully to game, and its a temporary thing until i can get more money.
<Sumica> 00,10R as in Robert logia
<owloysius> AlienWarhead: no, i try to read those even if the audio is english
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think we'd WMC the JB movie since the chat would hate it.
<Randomnerd> This guy.
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> she has 2 first gens anyway
<Dark92BETRAYED> richifles (insert scene transition) I'M BATMAN
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> its just with people coming up woth all kinds of ideas we probely have some one who has made on but did not publish it
<RAWRity> Reikim: Justin Beiber's Never Say Never Concert Movie
<Randomnerd> And that guy.
<Sumica> 00,10O as in Oh my god it's robert loga
<ScootaChicken> Justin Bieber honestly isn't that bad.
<Reikim> You'd be forced to, unfortunately.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: but you'd have to show it once.
<Tovler> people raging for 8 minutes before tiring out and leaving Bronystate… fucking hilarious?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> what movie is thid
<PonyStationVita> that voice lol
<otakon> Shizuka: where can I check to see who has won what for the lottery in the last month? If you know
<richfiles> Is it bad that I am dual weilding a pair of mice, one for my computer, and one for my tablet? :$
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<OohShiny> dis guy again?
<hen3ry> Its Codependence Day!
<ScootaChicken> He just makes boring and cliched if inoffensive teen pop.
<VenHur> Robert...Loga?
<Meanwhile> Tbh if that movie ever won I just wouldn't come.
<Jmo> oni_link: Apart from not having a GPU that is a decent tower.
<Spazturtle> The movie is too quiet
<TheKoreanBrony1354> what movie is this
<otakon> TheKoreanBrony1354: Independence Day Rifftrax
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> B as By god it's Robert Loga
<OohShiny> lol
<Randomnerd> Who wants to watch an extended music video?
<RaveBrony> Hey, Nittany, so the lotto today counts as 1 week until i can re enter?
<NocturnalBlade> TheKoreanBrony1354: Indenpendance Day
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> lets watch the NC review of this
<ScootaChicken> The internet just decided to single him out for whatever reason.
<oni_link> richfiles: nah like a bowss
<Reikim> I have an issue with concert movies in general. They're not really movies, I find; they're...
<Deadlypon3> XD
<Barbetos> ... Rasberry!... LONE STAR!!
<RaveBrony> *1 week towards
<OohShiny> Pedo
<pony_8048> this is my first movieand im enjoying it verry much :)
<Deadlypon3> W-Wow....
<Reikim> I don't even know how to describe it.
<ScootaChicken> He's honestly a fairly talented musician.
<otakon> sure sounds good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd say so.
<hen3ry> President sleeps with little girls
<WalkerPony89> IshGirlfriendlesPony: Odds are we will
<Fisheh_Fish> TheKoreanBrony1354: Independence Day Rifftrax
<Pale_Horse> "B" as in "Bob, Look over there! It's Robert Loggia!"
<otakon> it counts goddammit
<SteveCharb> ScootaChicken: baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
<owloysius> still better than the senate
<otakon> IT GODDAMN COUNTS
<RAWRity> Reikim: they's mostly just Tour documentaries
<VenHur> W as...Who's Robert Loga?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think it counts.
<Conyst> Not 40%
<Tovler> Too recent? Hugo came out on DVD in like March
<CriticKitten> It's funny because Megyn Kelly
<otakon> you picked a movie at random
<otakon> Tovler: still in the last year
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> ScootaChicken Nope
<Buytoast> MURIKA
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> someone has mad a pony version of MST3K on youtube
<Fisheh_Fish> Well, I'm off y'all. Enjoy the movie :)
<Buytoast> Fight everyone!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Bob ping
<ScootaChicken> SteveCharb: It's less annoying than other songs I could care to mention.
<FlutterMEDIC> bye Fisheh
<Dark92BETRAYED> Fez_Quick_Thinker: Oh, i thought somepony else thought of the idea of the Mystery Science Pony Theater 6000 (STILL working on the name)
<fluttercry> 05,15I think you overestimate the trolling potential of that.
<NocturnalBlade> bye Fisheh_Fish
<otakon> Tovler: I think it's riskier to get recently released movies then older titles
<SpiitFiire> My teacher made us Watch this and War of the worlds at school. Then compare them.
<fluttercry> 05,15Most people would just leave
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Alright, just making sure :P
<alexxm> bye Fisheh_Fish
<oni_link> Jmo: yeah, I dont know whether to go with NVIDIA or ATI. and i have no idea which cards I should be checking out as a point of refrence. but its good to know that that kit should be good enough :)
<Pale_Horse> No newswriter woth his salt would write that. :P
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i came up with that name DAMNIT
<Will_Smith> 1,11Sounds just like George Bush during his re-election.
<SteveCharb> ScootaChicken: yeah but it's the least effort ever put into a song's lyrics
<Tovler> So I take it TDKR won't play here until 2014.
<SteveCharb> less than trololo
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> SpiitFiire: The old War of the Worlds, or the Gibson one?
<RAWRity> fluttercry: just like how most people left during epic movie- oh wat.
<Deadlypon3> Will_smith Oooh, topical
<RAWRity> *wait.
<SpiitFiire> Old one DERPDERPDERPDERP
<Jmo> oni_link: Both are great brands, ATI is more affordable.
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> i came up with in the chat like maybe 100 posts agao
<hen3ry> It's pretty clear that the President in this movie is Republican. Because Will Smith's girlfriend voted for the other guy.
<ScootaChicken> SteveCharb: Nah, it actually has verses and stuff.
<Conyst> Gnomes
<Reikim> RAWRity: That's the thing, they're not really movies, they're tour documentaries built to pander to the fanbase.
<RAWRity> Tovler: most likely. But we can always watch Batman and Robin.
<Kandarihu> The heck with it. This movie isn't very good anyway. So I'm not going to put it ahead of my cats who need feeding or dinner, but I will put it ahead of PSO2.
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Meet the Spartans foar A movie
<OohShiny> Space Odyssey?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Boom!
<Rosfox> XD
<DerpStar> hen3ry: Unless she votes republican
<SteveCharb> ScootaChicken: eh I've always turned it off a few babies in
<Jmo> oni_link: Something like a HD7750 should do you good.
<otakon> it's not a goddamn A
<RAWRity> Reikim: still technically films. It even had a theatrical release. So....
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> explosive cuts
<WalkerPony89> Does that even have the budget for A IshGirlfriendlesPony?
<Phase4> 00,02satellites move a bit faster than that
<Conyst> I just lost my signal.
<Reikim> Actually, play the Bieber movie, just so we can have a quiet chat for once.
<otakon> it doesn't have the budget or earnings
<hen3ry> DerpStar: unlikely, demographically
<DerpStar> hen3ry: Or independent
<fluttercry> 05,15Most of you were here for Babes in Toyland right?
<Phase4> 00,02like a lot faster
<PonyStationVita> omg twin towers still there
<Will_Smith> 1,11ANd now for our jewish stereotyp.
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> otakon you said its not, therefore it is
<Kandarihu> Wait. That doesn't make sense, what I just said. I'm going to put up with this.
<Phase4> 00,02i know, i play kerba
<OohShiny> A nice game of chess.
<Will_Smith> 1,11ANd it's the Steve Guttenberg of sci-fi, Jeff Goldblum.
<Phase4> 00,02kerbal'
<RAWRity> fluttercry: afriad I wasn't.
<Deadlypon3> Isn't this the same scene from X-men 3?
<otakon> IshGirlfriendlesPony: FINE! Proof incoming
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Never make light of that movie.
<Tovler> Bronystate was almost shut down when they played Inception
<ScootaChicken> fluttercry: I forgot whether that or Spider's Web was Tacowiz's handiwork.
<Meanwhile> We lost good people during that.
<Wrek> what we watching, independence day?
<VenHur> Sorry, closed the page by accident.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We've shown the other two Christopher Nolan Batmans.
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> okay there is a pony MST3K fic its called Mystery Pinkie Pie Theater 3000
<Reikim> RAWRity: Well on that logic we could stream anything that got released in theatres. I hate the Bieber hatedom just as much as you do, but I still don't think it should be played as a movie.
<Sumica> 00,10they also hang 8 km in the air and do loops Phase4
<PonyStationVita> eyup
<AlienWarhead> Totally not offense to jews >_>
<Conyst> That's the burning smell.
<Deadlypon3> Will_smith Jeff Goldblum playing Jeff Goldblum
<Wrek> i head goldblum
<Wrek> took a lucky guess
<otakon> cost 30 mill est.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah
<Will_Smith> 1,11Deadlypon3 indeed
<otakon> made 18 mill in the US
<RAWRity> Reikim: technically, if it's a cinematic length film, we could play it.
<oni_link> Jmo: wow, thats actually pretty affordable. i wont be able to play on ultra with that though huh?
<alexxm> night guys
<fluttercry> 05,15Jeff Goldbloom always plays himself
<otakon> it's not a A
<OohShiny> you lose
<Reikim> Let's ask mods
<Meanwhile> A blender for Christmas....WHO WANTS A BLENDER FOR CHRISTMAAAAAAS
<Deadlypon3> Yay for goat
<oni_link> night alexxm
<richfiles> Isn't that older dude the dad from Numb3rs??? :)
<VenHur> You guys liked Homestar Runner by the way?
<NocturnalBlade> nite alexxm
<fluttercry> 05,15and he's ALWAYS awkward and says "um" a lot.
<Kandarihu> Chess, a strange game. The only winning move is to flip the table over. How about a nice civil game of Thermonuclear War?
<DerpStar> bai alexxm dear
<Reikim> Hey, mods, are there any other restrictions on movies beside the obvious?
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> Bender?
<Spazturtle> oni_link: Should be able too
<hen3ry> box turtle < mine turtle
<Conyst> It's been 1,2,5 years
<SirGanjalf> "And I, uh uh Jeff Goldblum as stereotype of uh uh, myself."
<MrBen> VenHur: Loved it
<otakon> A budget for post 2000 moves is over 100K mill
<oni_link> Spazturtle: really?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hey it's John delancie!
<SpiitFiire> Night Everyone! Talk to you soon!
<FlutterMEDIC> night
<Shizuka> 13bzzzz
<Deadlypon3> Why are you talking like this!?
<Bronysith> otakon: 100 thousand million?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: awesome and I missed them? dammit
<Jmo> oni_link: Ultra in games like BF3/Crysis 2/3/ETC you'd require something abit more then that, the 7750 will allow you to play most games on decent settings though.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This guy could use another cigarette.
<RAWRity> otakon: we've had A movies from after 2000 with lower budgets.
<Barbetos> Riding a bike through your office. Oh the 90's.
<cratorkid> dat draino
<DerpStar> Night SpiitFiire
<fluttercry> 05,15I remember Rob Walker did Jeff Goldbloom in a NC episode once. It was spot on
<SirGanjalf> throat cancer much?
<OohShiny> Kandarihu A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of Street Fighter II?
<otakon> Bronysith: no dammit, typo
<Fez_Quick_Thinker> no joke there is a fic of MST3K of ponies its named Mystery Pinkie Pie Theater 3000
<otakon> RAWRity: but they were GOOD
<Will_Smith> 1,11Jeff Goldblum is...The wicked witch of the TV room
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Meet the Spartans were by the same people that made Disaster Movie, right?
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> so how long does a movie have to on dvd in order to be able to choose it
<RAWRity> A movie =/= Summer Blockbuster
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: yup
<Barbetos> What is his characters name?
<Kandarihu> OohShiny, I was inverting Wargames
<Sumica> 00,10dat tv show
<VenHur> *yawns and sleeps*
<otakon> if it's a BAD movie it needs to be 100 mill budget minimum I think
<Deadlypon3> Will_Smith why does he talk like that?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yes
<RAWRity> otakon: eenope.
<Obsidian> Need to head off. Night everypony!
<OohShiny> Kandarihu: Well, I stole your face!
<FlutterMEDIC> night
<otakon> with at least as much in earnings in the US
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Goodnight Obsidian!
<Conyst> MPPT3k is pretty good
<hen3ry> Fun Fact: Imperial Valley IS the next Barstow
<oni_link> Jmo: A 5870 should be fine for that dont you think?
<Spademagnes[R]> What is this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could actually tell since Meet the Spartans had the same problems as Disaster Movie.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Obsidian: dream of ponies
<DerpStar> Night FlutterMEDIC
<otakon> it barely made HALF of it's budget back
*cratorkid is waiting for a black guy to show up
<RAWRity> otakon: and as you've likely never seen NSN, I don't think you get to call on whether it's bad or not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Namely drawn out bad jokes.
<Spademagnes[R]> Which movie is this?
<SirGanjalf> mmm foie gras
<otakon> RAWRity: what is NSN?
<ScootaChicken> My choice has been Fight Club for A, Trainspotting for B for quite a while.
<RAWRity> otakon: Never Say Never
<Reikim> Just a sec, I'm going to try and judge the limits of what we're allowed in terms of movies.
<Kandarihu> OohShiny, good thing I have spare faces.
<fluttercry> 05,15Trainspotting rocks
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> where da feck is Will Smaith
<Reikim> Would this be allowed?
<ScootaChicken> I'm fairly sure that a good case can be argued for both categories.
<otakon> RAWRity: Never Say NEver is a goddamn documentary
<Reikim> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Baraka

<ScootaChicken> WE HAD TO STUDY THAT IN ENGLISH
<OohShiny> Kandarihu all over equestria? in case of spare face emergency?
<Will_Smith> 1,11Deadlypon3: He talks like that because he's Jeff Goldblum.
<VenHur> Where's can I find the pony version of MST3K?
<ScootaChicken> OH GOD IT WAS HORRIBLE
*Kurra cuddles someone :}
<VenHur> Just asking.

<fluttercry> 05,15Are...they going to use it?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, the avatar movie was just bad
<Cypresswolf> Have we streamed Dragonball Evolution yet? That might be WMC'd
<cratorkid|Toga> Shizuka: i worship akoo
<Phase4> 00,02not funny bad, bad
<SirGanjalf> CHECKMATE:O
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> I don't get the Kelsey Grammer joke
<Meanwhile> It's currently out.
<otakon> Motion controls RUINED Steel Battalion
<DerpStar> Nature finds a way?
<Will_Smith> 1,11Nittany_Discord: the WMC was made AFTER the Avatar movie was shown, hence it's not on the list yet. :P
<desertman2> More reason to show it again
<EspyLacopa> Step away from the light!
<Phase4> 00,02like the star wars holiday specials
<SirGanjalf> :D
<XAX> Phase4: benders one, or the bluepeople one
<Reikim> What is Metro? Other than the company I work for, of course.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: Mtn Dew had a new flavor soda, and were having an online poll with viewer submissions for the name. Most were something like "Gushing Granny". 4chan got "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong" to #1 before the site was taken down.
<Phase4> 00,02just plain bad
<otakon> IshGirlfriendlesPony: he's apparently a bad drive
<fluttercry> 05,15Nittany_Discord THEY CAN'T USE METRO ANYMORE! the name apparently belongs to someone else
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, benders
<JESmith71> I remember that some TV station that showed Johnny Carson reruns made fun of that scene by having Carson be above the ship and had Leno and Letterman lookalikes staring up in shock
<WalkerPony89> otakon: Looked like a fun game too
<Phase4> 00,02bluepeople one was meh with amazing cg
<XAX> Phase4: yeah, it wasn't great.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So we did WMC The Last Airbender?
<hen3ry> Ok, aliens stop over Empire State Building (at that time not the tallest building in NY), and White House (not even close to tallest) - good intel?
<otakon> Reikim: a post-apocalyptic FPS with story
<DerpStar> Hawt
<Barbetos> Get some pants on Will_Smith
<XAX> Phase4: Animated series > movie. by miles.
<otakon> linear with a strong narrative
<otakon> no mp
<fluttercry> 05,15So it won't be released? I can't go to my 7/11 and get Hitler Did Nothing Wrong?
<Will_Smith> 1,11Smith's so swag, he's got two bitches in his bed every morning.
<DerpStar> NO LEAVE THEM OFF
<JESmith71> *In a commerical for it
<RAWRity> fluttercry: but they're still gonna be using that interface. and it's terrible.
<Reikim> Seriously, what is Metro, aside from the grocery company I work for oh thanks otakon
<CriticKitten> We didn't, Nittany, but it should have been.
<Phase4> 00,02Will_Smith, oh you :P
<EspyLacopa> Avatar, the one with the blue people, was a Smurf slash fanfic.
<Meanwhile> I hate 3D. 3D's been tried every...30 years? of cinema and it's flopped every time. Now is no different. 3D is a stupid idea until Star Trek Holodecks exist.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Phase4: Although, the scene where five earthbenders danced for 2 minutes to lift a small stone did get a chuckle out of me.
<Cypresswolf> :3 If & when I ever get a movie in, my attemps at a 2nd will aim for a WMC
<RAWRity> fluttercry: afraid not. Looks like it's going to be named "Tempest"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01fluttercry: Sadly, no.
<alfopony> HA!
<otakon> Reikim: actually they might be thinking of a different MEtro.... sorry I'm wrong in this case
<WalkerPony89> I'd buy Mountain Dew if it was called Hitler did nothing wrong
<SirGanjalf> An alien! *SHOT*
<VenHur> Will_Smith: If we have a Worst Movie Clause list, maybe we shoud make something I would called a "Bronystate's Hall of Fame" list...y'know, for good movies.
<fluttercry> 05,15Will Smith is undeniably the coolest man to ever live on this Earth
<Will_Smith> 1,11No, we DIDN'T WMC Last Airbender because WMC didn't come up until after it was showed.
<VenHur> Sorry for that wall of spam.
<VenHur> Didn't seent that comming.
<Barbetos> So how many times has Will Smith had fake kids and wives?
<Deadlypon3> Fluttercry right next to the inventor of ponies :p
<cratorkid|Toga> fluttercry: nope- shuck testa
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry What about Samual L Jackson?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think you could trademark Metro unless you were good at patent trolling.
<fluttercry> 05,15Deadlypon3 no. He's cooler
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like that Edge magazine guy.
<fluttercry> 05,15Samuel L. Jackson is a few places lower
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> boom boom boom
<OohShiny> oh shit
<Randomnerd> Mmm Mountain Dew
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: this is the Tech industry. Patent trolling is all they do.
<fluttercry> 05,15Well...something happened and they can't use Metro now
<DerpStar> Canada is safe!
<SirGanjalf> buh buh buh buh
<OohShiny> AWOOOGA!
<Cypresswolf> I think the last WMC'd movie was Epic Movie
<Will_Smith> 1,11When I first heard Will Smith was going to be a superhero, I was really REALLY hoping he was going to play Green Lantern.
<Crippler> lol
<alfopony> oh no not moscow
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: Apple just won 1.2 billion dollars for apparently having the patent on rounded black rectangles.
<Deadlypon3> Will_Smith OH GOD THAT WOULD BE PERFEcT
<Pale_Horse> That's kind of mean. Nobody nowadays hates Nazis more than Germans. :(
<Reikim> What
<Phase4> thats right, he was a va in mulan wasnt he
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't think he would've worked as John Stewart
<RAWRity> fluttercry: they can't use the NAME. The interface is still shit.
<Reikim> Link please so I can gouge my eyes out.
<Kandarihu> Just so you know guys, this movie kind of runs on a rather blind form of American patriotism, and centers around a speech that only is only justified by the action genre. I'm bracing for equally blind America bashing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: My goodness.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's shit.
<VenHur> Will_Smith: You has made minds being blowned.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: look up the Apple Vs Samsung case.
<hen3ry> Southern Hemisphere is irrelevant
<Randomnerd> Damn Wine!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> checkmate

<MrBen> That guy...didn't he play Egon Spengler?

<Deadlypon3> OHmaaah gooawwwd
<VenHur> OMAIGUD
<Cypresswolf> I gotta call my loan shark - Forget my loan shark
<Reikim> I blame the system that lets this shit happen.
<PillowPoni> OHMAIGAWD
<Spectrum_Rush> ERMAGERD
<CriticKitten> XD
<otakon> I suddenly feel rage
<CriticKitten> Stay the course!
<Kandarihu> Well, the way I figure it, political discussions are unavoidable here
<MrBen> Spectrum: Didn't think so. He just reminds me of him, though.
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah yeah I know the interface is still there. But thankfully it's entirely cosmetic. So if you don't upgrade you aren't missing much.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14haha, laywer joke
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> seems legit
*DerpStar plays a derpy video
<otakon> real I want to beat the shit out of a dumbass rage
<Randomnerd> Yeah, I have no way to figure out how to spend that much.
<MrBen> KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON
<richfiles> That "Cordless" phone! :D\
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu we need a better America movie like "Captian America the First Avenger"
<otakon> Randomnerd: build an island
<otakon> move there
<otakon> hold arena combat
<RAWRity> Apple's ENTIRE CASE was that, after they released the iPhone, Samsung started releasing touchpad devices that were black rectangles. They don't hold the patent on touch-screens, but they were apparently able to make the case that Samsung stole the idea of RECTANGLES WITH ROUNDED EDGES.
<Meanwhile> Stupid internet.
<otakon> using the CEO's of various scumbag companies
<AlienWarhead> :)
<Deadlypon3> So...Uhm...Why don't they MOVE AWAY FROM THIS!?

<XylemTube> One of the few funny parts of the actual movir
<Randomnerd> otakon: Okay, that's a good point.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's true.
<Reikim> Ok, excuse me.
<otakon> I have to tell someone
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead, the same issue would come up then.
<alfopony> discord is afoot
<VenHur> The Great and Powerful Oz...makes sense. I'm not complaining, Nope, nadah.
<NocturnalBlade> oh lol Jasmine
<cratorkid|Toga> oh no , NOT BENDER

<RAWRity> All Browniest.
<Bronysith> otakon: no one has common sense anymore
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just greedy people being greedy.
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade: Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
<Reikim> I'm going to just withdraw from this nonsensical world now and hope to God this is a bad dream.
<Malk> This wont happen I yell calling all bronies lets group up and finally take over the united states
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Abusing broken laws.
<Will_Smith> 1,11Will Smith. The only guy who can talk back to the hand and NOT have to sleep on the couch.
<Reikim> Note to self: hope isn't worth a damn anymore.
<DerpStar> Malk: MLP is doing for us
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: sorry, just was funny for that moment
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And lobbying for more broken laws so they can stay in business.
<CriticKitten> You thought wrong, Smith. :D
<Kandarihu> You know what? I think I changed my mind on my pick for A Movie.
<RAWRity> I'm telling you, the US patent system is going to crash and burn in the next decade.
<DerpStar> Canadians have been planing this invasion since before Shatner
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If not sooner.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Staying optimistic William, I like that.
<Reikim> It's not going to crash and burn, oh no.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Along with our copyright system.
<Reikim> That would be underestimating it.
<XylemTube> I completely forgot abouyt that movie
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade: Only you and Nitt know my name.
<AlienWarhead> Kandarihu maybe, but I think The First Avenger is at least a bit better at patriotism
<OohShiny> no last "I love you"?
<Kandarihu> My old pick is still going to be my fallback option, just in case my first pick is conflicted over.
<RAWRity> I can almost guarantee it will coincide with the crash fo the current tech industry. Most likely when Facebook finally goes under.
<princess> hi Nittany_Discord and Scoot-Scootaloo
<Reikim> It's going to implode like a nice little star of three solar masses or larger, and then it's going to fold in on itself.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi princess.
<Will_Smith> 1,11I just realized...Airbender's large budget could qualify it as an A movie. :P
<Spectrum_Rush> dat freaky deaky
<OohShiny> where's the last "I love you"?
<Malk> Gotta post pone some
<XylemTube> Dem ebonics
<Will_Smith> 1,11"thinking you're all that"
<desertman2> NO
<Applechip> Yes he is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PillowPoni: I forget your actual nick right now.
<Will_Smith> 1,11Bitch, he IS all that.
<Deadlypon3> Yes I am :3
<Reikim> And then, after a while, it will condense upon a singularity of stupidity.
<hen3ry> Captain Badass, get moving already
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead, perhaps. But the movie isn't.
<DerpStar> Will_Smith: Airbender sucked
<Kandarihu> Er, wait.
<SirGanjalf> :D
<RAWRity> because Facebook will not be around in 5 years. I guarantee you that.
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: ok ok ^_^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More like greed Reikim.
<pikorar> This is just New York. Always.
<cratorkid|Toga> our ships will block out the sun !
<DerpStar> Dem Vultures
<Reikim> And then it's going to punch through the folds of common sense and turn into a supermassive black hole of stupidity and greed.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not quite
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 Wilhelm scream
<Reikim> See Nitt? I was getting to the greed part.
<RAWRity> Zuckerberg's already seen the signs, and he's getting his money and getting the fuck out of there.
<Barbetos> Or.. VOLTures?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I mean, they got the NYC traffic down
<Barbetos> Batteries with wings?
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead, what I meant to say is that the quality of the movie is irrelevant.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but we're not quite THAT looty
<Pale_Horse> Attaching Shymalan's name to any movie past "Unbreakable" automatically re-classifies the movie choice as "B" for lottery qualification... :(
<Reikim> Thus the entire world will be sucked in by their stupidity and shortsightedness.
<PillowPoni> Nittany_Discord: It's the name of Will Smith's wife in this movie :3
<fluttercry> 05,15Facebook trading has been a disaster

<SirGanjalf> :D
<Reikim> Long story short: Zuckerberg's a shrewd and profitable businessman, but also an asshole. The two tend to overlap consistently.
<otakon> how can you get away patenting a goddamn shape that can occur in nature?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: not admitted, but it's clear he gives no fucks about the integrity of his company.

<Kandarihu> Barbetos, and the popsicle stick?

<princess> ima just keep pressing refresh until i see something
<Saturn> 08,01so, say i have 10 storage servers with 10TB storage each on them
<Spademagnes[R]> A roflcopter

<Buytoast> One funeral! AH AH AH AH AH
<MrBen> hen3ry: ohhhhh. lol
<Reikim> I thought the small talk was the first step?
<Will_Smith> 1,11Speaking of Beauty and the Beast, anyone who says that the piece of shit Beastly show is going to be any good, you can leave right now.
<otakon> Shizuka: there must be someone that does a antoher good one you like
<Major> DerpStar: Yes :'(
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> wait the MST3K guys played half life so awesome

<Meanwhile> The introduction is the key.
<Reikim> Anyway, Saxy, if you see a cosplayer in a homemade cosplay, ask about it. As far as my experience goes, artsy types love to talk about their work.
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> never be a bad pony LESSON LEARNED
<Deadlypon3> "WHAT HAPPENED MOMMY?"
<owloysius> 78 years! ha ha ha
<ScootaChicken> But for those who are uninformed, I was coerced into cosplaying as Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club for MCM in October.

<Reikim> If someone's taken the time to make something, they'll react well to someone showing interest in admiration for it.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a good pony
<JESmith71> Spademagnes[R]: Jerry Nelson. A Muppet performer
<Reikim> It is one of my weak points.
<XylemTube> they don't stand a chance
<Reikim> Also
<Shizuka> 13>not suzumiya
<SirGanjalf> "Ha ha, he said ass!"
<CriticKitten> XD

<cratorkid|Toga> heeaarr yeah!
<RAWRity> Shizuka: Ouran > Haruhi
<JESmith71> He wasn't just the Count of course
<fluttercry> 05,15I'd like to be Richter Belmont....or Scott Pilgrim...
<Meanwhile> If I were to cosplay Ouran it'd probably be Honey.
<Spademagnes[R]> 400 rupees he dies next
<AlienWarhead> I'm sure he'll live>_>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile funny cause haruhi is a chick who looks like a dude
<otakon> I could only go as Ekei Ankokuji or Ghim...

<Buytoast> Three grieving wives! AH AH AH AH AH
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yes that was the joke.

<Pale_Horse> "Space"...
<cowvarkian> NORAD still exists?
<OohShiny> owloysius In URRS, USSR IS URRS!
<otakon> Neil could do Haruhi
<JESmith71> He was Gobo on Fraggle Rock, Robin, Floyd and so many others
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I might be able tp pull off Ezio

<Barbetos> Aw. I missed the Half Life 2 one
<Kandarihu> It's almost as if the force fields are reacting to the missiles as if they are active energy instead of potential energy that is released when they reach the target.
<Shizuka> 13i hate having audio in only one ear
<otakon> they're cheap
<SpiritFang> Sweet dreams, Saturn :P

<Reikim> They're four, they talk, they're old enough to learn what the hell NO means.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: ...I know your pain. Just moved, and my neighbors have a 4 year old. She is so loud, I can hear her at the back of my house, despite her being ACROSS THE STREET.
<OohShiny> Grand Canyon?
<Shizuka> 13ja
<cowvarkian> sure
<JESmith71> Of course it sucks more that the only original Muppet performers left are Carrol Spinney (Big Bird) and Dave Golez (Gonzo). Frank Oz may still be alive but he doesn't work with Muppets that much aside from going on Sesame Street from time to time
<Spademagnes[R]> USE THE BOOST TO GET THROUGH

<OohShiny> Will Smith is that badass

<VenHur> Dat sarcasm.
<SpiritFang> I'm sure the department of education could have done a better job... totally.
<EspyLacopa> Incoming data.
<Pale_Horse> I always think Area 51 is the hometown of Suda 51... :(
<RAWRity> Area 51 is paper clips. Area 52 is aliens. Area 53 is where they're keeping the 5 other seasons of Firefly

<Major> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9agojeKP21r9u6yko1_500.jpg
<hen3ry> Thats because Data was Best Human
<Shizuka> 13which is funny cause it means the racing games i'm used to are depicting extremely slow travel

<VenHur> ....Hmm...
<Shizuka> 13granted it was 10 miles of interstate in the middle of nowhere illinois just as the sun was setting, with semis everywhere
<Conyst> I'm partial to area 7
<Barbetos> Area 42 has all the answers.

<Pale_Horse> Remember. Don't let Data KNOW he's an android, or he'll have an existential crisis and go on a killing spree... :|
<PillowPoni> Cinderblocks lol

<fluttercry> 05,15wait I missed Brent Spinner?
<cowvarkian> sure
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can go fast.
<DerpStar> AlienWarhead: I wasn't thinking of that 69 dear
<Shizuka> 13i could do 65 but i think i was distracted by curves and hills and let it slow way down while i was concentrating

<Deadlypon3> "PEOEPLE ARE DYING! And yet we had a 'funny' scene with the jewish sterotype"
<SpiritFang> Perhaps they keep the portal to Equestria in Area 51, too...
<RAWRity> the real reason Hagar couldn't Drive 55 was because his car went up to 4000 RPMs everytime he broke 50
<thelonepony> area 63 is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The speed limit would be 70 in many parts.
<fluttercry> 05,15WAIT WUT!

<otakon> passenger
<Kandarihu> Rule 85: If it exists, there is a pony of it. No exceptions.
<Pale_Horse> Area 33 is where they developed the secret o making the glue on Post-It notes...
<Shizuka> 13between four-year-old emma and the general stress my parents have at their jobs anyway, i don't look for time to insert "let's have shizu drive around"..
<SirGanjalf> Area 404 is nowhere on the maps.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you did 75, you'd get passed by half of it.
<DerpStar> Deadlypon3: You do realize they are portraying Jews as saviors here right?
<Will_Smith> 1,11Fluttercry: He let it grow out and died it to give himself a new identity.
<SteveCharb> oh, Data

<SteveCharb> fluttercry: close your eyes and tell me it isn't
<PillowPoni> SirGanjalf: It's best to pretend that Area 34 doesn't exist.
<JESmith71> Oh come on you know a Data ref was coming up somewhere
<RAWRity> Took 4 years for my mom to be comfortable enough with me behind the wheel to let me get my license.
<OohShiny> SirGanjalf I actually go there... not for the ponies though.

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Area 63 Nittanys favorite
<VenHur> What about Area 6, I heard ponies are held captive in there...
<Spademagnes[R]> Area 6
<Malk> I forget which one is The portal to equestria?

<OohShiny> Malk that's area 404
<Spademagnes[R]> Full of disk satilights
<Kandarihu> Malk, I said 85

<otakon> >Punch knocks them out
<AlienWarhead> The trailer are invading!
<cowvarkian> I thought so fluttercry
<RAWRity> otakon: to be fair, our technology is advanced against gorillas, but gorillas can still kick our asses 1-on-1
<Kandarihu> Pale_Horse, how about Ewoks?
<PillowPoni> >mfw Dark Crystal just came on
<otakon> yeah but come ON
<otakon> we SEE what this suit can do

<SirGanjalf> Wanna see my "clearance"?
<Barbetos> LET THEM GO!!
<hen3ry> Have one alien. Let ALL the people in
<otakon> and yet a PUNCH to the "head" is enough to knock them unconcious
<Shizuka> 13mike nails it
<VenHur> Pale_Horse: How about Jar Jar's species?
<Pale_Horse> Ewoks would be awesome too. But they wouldn't use lasers. They would just conquer us with spears and dropped rocks from gliders. :P
<Deadlypon3> OH boi!
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> i have been all around the area of nevada and the mountains are covered by black out SUVs and other things like scanners and some minefield warnings
<Shizuka> 13a punch to the head would knock us unconscious :3
<otakon> yet it can kill and maim several people easily
<Malk> That secruity really sucks
<VenHur> Now THAT would be scary.
<Shizuka> 13no matter how advanced we get
<RAWRity> otakon: punch to the head following a plane crash
<otakon> Shizuka: but not if you're wearing a helmet
<Meanwhile> What if we advance metal skulls?
<Shizuka> 13if the force is strong enough
<Spademagnes[R]> But at least Will survived
<otakon> RAWRity: that was still shielded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even in armor?
<Shizuka> 13your brain is still nice and squishy
<thelonepony> ^
<DerpStar> ah crap that means Canada
<Spademagnes[R]> Where there is a Will Smith there is a way
<Will_Smith> 1,11I always survive, bitches.
<otakon> hmmm my suspension of disbelief is very low right now
<otakon> for this movie
<AlienWarhead> What would happen if the Daleks invade after these aliens?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe in the future, when we discover immortality.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> At least Rhode Island should slip by.
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> if you even walk across the sign that says if you pass this point you can and WILL be shot
<cratorkid|Toga> canada is k tho
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We can survive gorillas.
<Pale_Horse> the, we turn the tables on the Ewoks when we develop the technology to make a board with a nail in it. ;)
<Kandarihu> A rock dropped from the upper atmosphere would carry a LOT of momentum at ground level.

<Will_Smith> 1,11Deadlypon3: shh.
<otakon> as brains floating in jars with mechanical arms and wheels
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And eat the Earth alive if we're still dumb enough not to promote space exploration.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it explains that concept where
<Crippler> Have we seen Mars Attacks! yet?
<SpiritFang> Hiller! Boo mah yay!
<Shizuka> 13the alien ships would have no reason to blow up the twin cities so i'm good
<otakon> SaxyPretender: no don't send me there...I'll never return...
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> Kandarihu theres omething called termanal velocity
<otakon> it is a death trap
<Will_Smith> 1,11DerpStar: NO! Watch the Alternate ending!
<SpiritFang> El freak xD
<fluttercry> 05,15Those vikings might be a threat
<Kandarihu> Tinfoil_QuickThinker, oh, you're right. Also wind drag.
<DerpStar> Will_Smith: Your death is canon
<DerpStar> Like original Derpy
<otakon> Shizuka: I live far away from anything important
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Shizuka> 13Tinfoil_QuickThinker: terminal velocity just means it can't pick up more speed, it's still an obscenely high speed for most things
<EspyLacopa> The fun thing is that if the object is moving fast enough in space, when it hits the atmosphere it'll start -slowing down-
<Pale_Horse> Is El Pollo Loco anything like Chik-Fil-A?
<EspyLacopa> In order to reach terminal velocity
<cowvarkian> like, 20 miles for raindrops
<SteveCharb> burn the land, boil the sea
<Will_Smith> 1,11DerpStar: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/455/bullshit.gif
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> and they couldn't see that from this far away BULLSHIT
<otakon> EspyLacopa: and the friction will usually destroy it
<hen3ry> Pale_Horse: vaguely, but not really
<SteveCharb> you can't take the skies from me
<Deadlypon3> It's only been a day!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Terminal velocity in space is c.
<EspyLacopa> Indeed.
<Kandarihu> Pale_Horse, not anymore.
<Will_Smith> 1,11It's Kenan and Kel.
<Reikim> Hey otakon
<SirGanjalf> :F
<Pale_Horse> Ah

<fluttercry> 05,15I live a few miles from the worlds largest Naval Station, so I'm screwed
<EspyLacopa> The friction, and thus stuff like the heat.

<Shizuka> 13uh oh

<SaxyPretender> 0,14thank you Reikim
<DerpStar> Will_Smith: I'm a Slytherin girl anyways

<Randomnerd> Is that... is that the President from BSG?
<Tinfoil_QuickThinker> i live not to far from hanger 18 so yeah IM GOOD TO GO
<MrBen> Derpy was a stripper?
<CriticKitten> ....so when Derpy is talking about her muffins....ogod
<EspyLacopa> If the object is large enough though, it wouldn't burn up in atmosphere, and would end up striking the surface at significantly above terminal velocity due to not having enough time to slow down entirely.
<thelonepony> dam buffer
<Kurra> Hey, it's President Rosalyn!
<fluttercry> 05,15SaxyPretender a pretty decent number fly over.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I'm jelly
<DerpStar> MrBen: Have to pay for the eyes somehow dear
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In simple terms, it's about balancing the forces of gravity + whatever is pushing the object + air resistance and solving for velocity.
<Randomnerd> Kurra: Ha
<Crippler> the boy or the dog?
<Spademagnes[R]> :3 doggy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's Stands With a Fist!
