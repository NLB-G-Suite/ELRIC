<Cypresswolf> not counting stops
<Bronies4evar> 8.45 pm BST now.
<drfsupercenter> 03because of technical limitations on the original Red and Blue.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> great and powerful *smooch* that kills me everytime
<drfsupercenter> 03on the Japanese version, they didn't have to worry about different cases
<Skylands> 10To make those words more noticeable, take a look at the difference in graphics from RBY to BW
<drfsupercenter> 03it was ust the kanji
<drfsupercenter> 03no, that's not it at all LOL
<cachi01> furthest i had to drive was 7 meters
<Bronies4evar> People should be telling the server that they need to go to bed in about 1/2 hour.
<Shamroc> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03at least I don't think so
<cachi01> worst 7 meters my family had n a car
<BlueFlare> 02it's probably both

<Sumica> 00,10Dash just keeps telling you to go faster and how she would have been there by now
<BlueFlare> 02Easier to program and more noticeable with low graphics
<Saturn> 8,1i'm not a big fluttershy fan

<Saturn> 8,1i prefer pinkie

<Gunthler> Shizuka: I trained myself to maintain control and tell myself that I'll be okay in the middle of a panic attack. I used to get em every time I would get high, so I had to quit.
<drfsupercenter> 03this guy supposedly got a score of 9999999999
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<ChrysaMaid> its not scotland that are sheepshaggers, its derby
<otakon> Sumica: that's bucked up and your thinking of Wales.

*otakon hugs DeathStar
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Saturn> 8,1Sumica: funny you should say that though; i once asked an aberdeenshire lad if it was true that up North they put the sheep's back legs in their wellies to stop them running away
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: really? take it away twilight "YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES"
<DeathStar> otakon: it's ok I know :)
<otakon> Cypresswolf: it's cooked sheep's stomach.
<ChrysaMaid> hello sound hound, how i have missed you for wrek streams
<otakon> Saturn: lol

<otakon> LOL
<flutter_spin> More Rainbow Mod Colors! More!
<Sumica> 00,10Funny thing is Saturn we have somthing called the 90lb law out here
<Cypresswolf> otakon: :) I know
<_> You know, I totally misread wellies.
<otakon> Sumica: I am not familiar with that, what is it?
<Saturn> 8,1Sumica: if it's more than 90lb, it's fair game?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<otakon> -___________-
<Saturn> 8,1ha!

<Saturn> 8,1i had an ex who admitted to me a certain liking for dogs
<DeathStar> I'm half welsh half new zealander *sigh* I'm doomed to a life of sheep shagger jokes
<Saturn> 8,1yes, in *that* way.
<Cypresswolf> New Orleans cuisine & cub scout camping trips have prepared me for the more....exotic dishes :)
<RustyMeat> what
<Saturn> 8,1it was... disconcerting
<ChrysaMaid> Saturn as in play, or the animal?
<Gunthler> Saturn: wat o_o
<Saturn> 8,1ChrysaMaid: the animal
<Cypresswolf> We used to roast bugs we found :)
<ChrysaMaid> each to their own, but thats weird
<Saturn> 8,1Cypresswolf: did you then eat them?
<otakon> ChrysaMaid: that's unhealthy
<LunaTheMaid> Heheh
<Mutterguy> DeathStar, I think rams are bit more choosy
<Saturn> 8,1because roast tarantula is delicious
<Litwick> Saturn: Excuse me while I go poor bleach down my throat so I don't have to live on the same planet as her.
<ChrysaMaid> whats unhealthy?
<otakon> Litwick: as who?
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: lol true
<Bronysith> Litwick: but then youll miss all the poines
<otakon> ChrysaMaid: I'm not sure
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's time to go shout things to death while looking like pinkie pie.
<Wrek> 05saturn
<Saturn> 8,1Litwick: you'd be surprised. there are a lot of people that exist who have... let's just say unorthodox sexual tastes.
<Cypresswolf> Yep, don't like spiders - but crikets, meal worms, earth worms are alright - beware of certain beetles
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >_>
<Wrek> 05this music is jsut a very light preview of what i will expose you to later
<otakon> Saturn: you of ALL people should say that.
<Cypresswolf> June Bugs - just say no

<Cypresswolf> If the poison doesnt get you, the electric chair or *ugh* lethal injection certainly will
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Saturn a little bit obsessive that kitchen
<otakon> awesome Saturn, you hear about that guy in the UK that made his flat into a Star Trek apartment?
<Saturn> 8,1TheGreatAndPowerfulT: pffft, no such thing!

<Saturn> 8,1otakon: oh aye, yeah, i saw that on the news
<Gunthler> Saturn: Does that radiation cause cancer?
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: one guy made his entire apartment int a Star Trek set.
<ChrysaMaid|City> aw man, playing arkham city to wrek soundtrack is AMAZING
<otakon> Gunthler: it can
<DeathStar> Cypresswolf: only the best chefs cook fugu and the sack is not hard to find
*Shizuka 13sneaks in, drops a wrek picture, and runs http://i.imgur.com/dmTJp.jpg

<Ryanier128> I'm fine otakon. Thanks Bronysith, and I've already tried that DeathStar. It worked for all about 2 minutes
<Mutterguy> Sumica, do you know anything about brazilian or Portugese cuisine? trying to think of something for a vegetarian potluck ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yahooz yep
<DeathStar> Ryanier128: the alchohol or ponys?
<Sumica> 00,10Not off the top of my head but i could check my notes
<Ryanier128> DeathStar both
<Yahooz> or sing it in the disembodied voice of Shizuka :3
<Saturn> 8,1http://buttersafe.com/2012/05/17/swimsuit-season/
<Kandarihu> I know your pain. I lost two cats lately. Now another one is bugging me.
<otakon> Ryanier128: I suggest you sit down and watch a good feel good movie. Something you both enjoy. Just try to relax and eat some popcorn.
<ChrysaMaid|City> Shizuka when we playing moonbase again?
<Shizuka> 13that's much easier... just drop it into balabolka and save the file
<DeathStar> Ryanier128: hugs??
<Shizuka> 13i dunno, nittany's the one that instigates it :3
<Midnight_Tempest> you know... just a little fun fact cause Pick of Destiny was played today... Tenacious D has a new album out called Rize of the Fenix... just sayin
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/it7Wi.jpg mfw nopony ever comments when i post this... it's because it's not ponies isn't it
<Mutterguy> my other criterea is it has to be gluten free
<otakon> Saturn: My mom's cat just went outside one day and never came back. She was 18 though, and getting senile. She was shedding and leaving blood droplets where she would lay. And peeing in random places.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Dat a nonpony Shizu? :o
<DeathStar> Shizuka: I haven't seen you post that it looks awesome
<Yahooz> Shizuka: i never see you post it ever tbh
<Ryanier128> thanks otakon. I've tried that too DeathStar, but not even allowing her to call me "Snuggle Bunny" worked . . . don't ask about that, it's a long story
<Midnight_Tempest> mfw its still an awesome pic Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13yup from years and years ago
<Yahooz> maybe its bad timing :/

<RAWRity> Bronysith: I'm afraid Saturn has already laid (heh) claim to Molestia

<BlueFlare> 02WiiWare and android
<RAWRity> Yahooz: yes.

<Yahooz> Shizuka: too bad otakon already holds that title
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03MFW no one knows who PaleoSteneo is :/
<RAWRity> otakon can DEAL WITH IT.
<Yahooz> nope
<Shizuka> 13but that simply means... since otakon x everything... and saturn x everything
<Shizuka> 13then the canonical ship is otakon x saturn
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony!! Im back, what is this lovely stuff being drawn on the stream?
<otakon> RAWRity: or, Wrek can ban you

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might have to commission Wrek for my drawing.
<BlueFlare> 02the android one is pretty good
<BlueFlare> 02brb
<otakon> Saturn: I'm in love
<DeathStar> Shizuka: maby it should be Saturn x what ever he likes
<Darkts33> Saturn: Clop clop clop
<RAWRity> or rather, otakon and Saturn are constantly competing in love triangles.
<Yahooz> That... set up... I came
<_> Lawl, the first link worked fine anyway
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Can I be shipped with that, Saturn?
<otakon> RAWRity: I AM NOT!
<CriticKitten> ....and then I laughed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why are we drawing Lil' Miss Rarity BTW?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it's not LMR
<CriticKitten> <Yahooz> otakon x Saturn? <otakon> Saturn: I'm in love
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I feel like cheating on the bucket...
<Darkts33> Nittany_Discord: IKR
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's close.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: no scarring
<CriticKitten> Sounds like confirmation to me
<Litwick> Nittany: They're not, do you SEE an open chest wound?
<Yahooz> CriticKitten: hells yeah
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: no, it's just a saucy Rarity that WRek loves to draw. You know he loves saucy ponies...
<DeathStar> Scoot-Scootaloo: :O
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It makes me not have nice things...
<Bronysith> EVERYPONY http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2792/
<Aurora> should be paired with http://9gag.com/gag/4177012
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: You aren't allowed to do that. Anybody who cheats on their OTP is automatically shipped into a love trianlge with Edward Cullen and Justin Beiber
<CriticKitten> Nice gaming rig, pity it's got Diablo 3 on it though.
<drfsupercenter> 03ew all that red bull
<CriticKitten> :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh gawd :O

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I won't add people until I can actually play!
<Saturn> 8,1he's not a cat person
<Saturn> 8,1not at all
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: A dog person then?
<Saturn> 8,1my mum is, though
<cachi01> otakon: XD
<LittleBrony> Hey Saturn I say your Gameboy livestream!
<RAWRity> Saturn: I have a cat. He's fat and lazy and adorable. Also, he poops in my cousin's shoes because he knows I hate my cousin.
<Saturn> 8,1TheRainbowDash: pretty much, yeah
<Darkts33> Scoot-Scootaloo: lolol dude the servers have been fixed since day 2
<ChrysaMaid> Scoot-Scootaloo what are you gonna play?
<Saturn> 8,1him and my brother like their big dogs
<Saturn> 8,1i don't like dogs
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Oh god, are there any cat and doggie battles? (if you have both species)
<ChrysaMaid> so trixie, so it is meanwhile
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Apparently I'm still down >:/
<Saturn> 8,1i find it odd how most people are either cat people of dog people
<Golakka> Your disowned saturn
<cachi01> i liek stegsaurus
<RAWRity> I prefer cats as far as pets go, but I like playing with my neighbors' dogs from time to time.
<PrincessLuna> I have 2 sugar gliders :) that's it
<CriticKitten> I like both, though I'm only able to own a cat at present.
<Saturn> 8,1TheRainbowDash: there were when we had a cat
<Darkts33> Scoot-Scootaloo: =/ well your computer makes Blizzard piss on it
<TheRainbowDash> Oh my.
<RAWRity> doooh, it's meanwhile!
<ChrysaMaid> but the last meanwhil you did was an earth stallion
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: i actually know many who are both cat and dog people
<Saturn> 8,1except our dog could probably fit the whole cat in his mouth
<TheRainbowDash> What?:D
<otakon> I KNEW IT!
<Saturn> 8,1but he was *terrified* of her
<Saturn> 8,1we have a biiiiiiig dog
<otakon> IT'S TRIXIE AND MEANWHILE!
<RAWRity> Saturn: My cat could actually eat some small dogs.
<LittleBrony> Who are the ponys you are drawing? Are they real ones from the show or your own ponys?
<Saturn> 8,1i miss having a kitty :(
<CriticKitten> ....*dies laughing*
<RAWRity> Saturn: kill the dog, replace it with a bobcat.
<Saturn> 8,1RAWRity: YES
<otakon> Saturn: for God's sake just go to the local shelter and take one in.
<Yahooz> That idea...
<Saturn> 8,1i would totally be up for that
<DaringDude> dis picture is ... o/////o
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: i can't
<CriticKitten> Someone cut and paste Diablo's head onto a poster for the movie "Failure to Launch". THAT PERSON WINS THE INTERNET.
<Biglaw> Saturn I had two cats, both are in a better place now :(
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: i live with my parents
<Ryanier128> I'm back
<otakon> Saturn: ah
<Barbetos> http://mini-deus.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-WoW-s-Extension-Boss-302465239
<Saturn> 8,1can't afford to have my own place at the moment
<otakon> wb Ryanier128
<Darkts33> Scoot-Scootaloo: where do you live?
<Saturn> 8,1Biglaw: i had 3, but they're not in a better place; they're dead

<Saturn> 8,1i do feed a stray, though
<Saturn> 8,1sometimes sleeps in the house
<Nittany_Discord_> Well shit.
<Saturn> 8,1but she's very nervous
<Nittany_Discord_> I thought my wireless was more stable than this.
<Saturn> 8,1and doesn't like people approaching her
<Saturn> 8,1loves to be petted, though
<Ryanier128> Scot-Scootaloo I know how you feel, but I, literally, dropped out of college
<Saturn> 8,1odd little cat
<Biglaw> Saturn one of them lived to be 19, the other only seven :(
<cachi01> i've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
<Saturn> 8,1aww
<RAWRity> So CriticKitten, I'm guessing you're rather amused that your apprehensions towards D3 were vindicated?
<Saturn> 8,1one of mine was about 19 or so
<otakon> Saturn: I have a family of ferals that live under the steps of my grandparents front door.
<Kid_Cobalt> Nittany_Discord: CPU 101 wireless is the ultimate troll.

<cachi01> twilight_sprinkler: tab skills are reduced to 2
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Very, actually. Obviously I feel sorry for people who bought the game, but I do somewhat enjoy the fact that Diablo 3's disasterous release has sort of helped prove my point that Blizzard has finally given up on being a good developer.
<DaringDude> i have been shipped with otakon
<Ryanier128> holy shit, disaster avoided
<MahBoi777> hey cachi01 and Ryanier128!
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: shipping of me excessivelhy is a bannable offense

<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: :| you...never started it :P playing WoW right now cant talk
<CCCP> u stud MahBoi777
<RAWRity> This pictures is inaccurate. Ponies do not have paper currency.
<Ouroboros> Cypresswolf, take a look at Keepass or other password managers.
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: I have to finish your "wings" >.>
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash it's okay, everypony has their likes and dislikes :|
<TheRainbowDash> RAWRity: Where is my 5 million money?
<SunderlandPony89> CCCP: I just got the Russian ad :P
<Darkts33> Kirz|art loves strippers =/
<SamanthaGirl159> otakon I can't seem to relax. Ryan is in crutches, I'm about to get married, and now I just witnessed this . . . what was is, Rule 36?
<CCCP> SunderlandPony89: lol
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: wait, your almost done?
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Colgate is already done :D I think youll be pleased...
<Cypresswolf> does Keepass require a password?
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: It is just my likes and dislikes, you dissapprove of, that is the point.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i still think this is otakon, it could be meanwhile but dat is a unicorn so no
<BlueFlare> 02LOL "it's your mind that's the problem"
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<SunderlandPony89> SamanthaGirl159: Yeah, this is Rule 34
<otakon> SamanthaGirl159: um..........I'm not sure. Just relax, Wrek draws this stuff at times. It's saucy at worst, but always well drawn.
<Wrek> 05^ i laugh at your missinformation
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: just get my wings, HURRY!
*MahBoi777 hugs DeathStar
<Ouroboros> Yes Cypresswolf, one masterpassword to secure it's db of passwords/account details
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: it's NOT
<Darkts33> Wrek: I laugh with your laugh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> as far as i know he goes by an earth pony i think
<FlareChaser> Wait, what is this? who is Wrek drawing? :P
<otakon> Darkts33: I laugh at your laugh of his laugh
<Biglaw> FlareChase no it's obviously me :p
<otakon> FlareChaser: If I were to guess, Meahwhile getting a lapdance from Trixie
<MahBoi777> O_o
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: It's a type of clop pic
<Cypresswolf> Ouroboros: I can't even remember my youtube word, and Im on that everyday...a new one isn't going to help
<FlareChaser> otakon: yum.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: argh
<Darkts33> its a clop pic DEAL WITH IT
<TheRainbowDash> otakon: o_o, oh my...I am going to get my camera.
*Wrek facehoofs
<MahBoi777> wut
<RAWRity> Anyway, back to listening to uncannily catchy K-Pop
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon i though meanwhile was an earth pony
<FlareChaser> Wrek: what? what is it then?
<otakon> Darkts33: it is not or it wouldn't be being streamed dammit!
<CCCP> this pic still probably wouldn't become canon
<MahBoi777> it's just a pic lol
<CCCP> becuase its too
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: not in this pic he's not
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon fair enough
<RAWRity> CCCP: that's because you haven't read my meanwhile x Trixie fic yet.
<FlareChaser> ohhhh
<FlareChaser> it is Meanwhile x Trixie
<FlareChaser> :3
<SamanthaGirl159> thanks SunderlandPony89. otakon have you ever been proposed to and the next day watch yourself and groom be in a car crash? Relaxation just isn't going to happen any time soon!
<CCCP> RAWRity: OMG!!!!!!!!!!! I NEED TO READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<CCCP> is it out?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity you finished already ?
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: CCCP not yet. But SOON.
<Cypresswolf> I just found my original set of car keys with my specks card, that I lost over 4 months ago, yesterday! along with $100 ^_^ in an old christmas card looking for some documents for work
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Well, it is a type of clop pic!
<CCCP> RAWRity: can't wait!
<Darkts33> im going to make a fanfic of Otakon kissing at his own reflection
<FlareChaser> ....now we need more Flare Chaser x Colga- ah screw it.
<Darkts33> hahaha
<Ouroboros> Well the idea being you just remember one password (to access the db) and then keep the account details in keepass, Cypresswolf, but if that's a problem too then it isnt going to help much.
<RAWRity> I need to make some quick revisions, because Wrek gave me the GREATEST IDEA EVER.
<TheRainbowDash> RAWRity: Oh ok, but send me a direct link to it, immediately when you finish that fic.
<MahBoi777> Cypresswolf: sounds like one helluva good day
<otakon> SamanthaGirl159: well, freaking out is not going to help. All you can do is be thankful your both still alive and try to relax.
<RAWRity> TheRainbowDash: can do
<CCCP> SunderlandPony89: its not rule 34 the picture could make it onto EQD
<Darkts33> uhh whats that
<Cypresswolf> I could just write it all down and hide the list REALLY well....but then I'd forget where I hid that in a few weeks anyways
*DeathStar dances
<FlareChaser> ..we're getting more Flare Chaser x Colgate? right? RIGHT? .....nevermind :|
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CCCP it could but saucy trixie is not something sethisto post daily
<Darkts33> so... two strippers =/

<CCCP> SamanthaGirl159: A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. USB flash drives are typically removable and rewritable, and physically much smaller than a floppy disk.

<MahBoi777> hey Sumica
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Besides, if he wants to ditch the role, they might talk him into playing Iron Man for Avengers 2 and kill the character off. They ARE facing off against a guy who is best known for singlehandedly killing half the Marvel universe.
<imaturtle> dat purple
<cachi01> Sumica: trixie..... in lingirie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Glad I skipped Maid Hour.
<Sumica> 00,10seems nice to me Scoot|NoNiceThings
<otakon> Guys, I'll brb
<MahBoi777> lol
<SamanthaGirl159> Sumica it's Trixie and meanwhile. Something to do with shipping
<Golakka> I am not sure that i agree with the current subject, but i will go allong with it
<Sumica> 00,10I am ok with this
<imaturtle> he uses skype
<FlareChaser> Wrek: I am not being shocked! I am simply entertained.
<CCCP> i want to eat chicken
<Scoot|NoNiceThings> 00,03Oh that's Meanwhile? 
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Or, they kill him off in Iron Man 3. Have War Machine take his place in Avengers 2
<SamanthaGirl159> Scoot|NoNiceThings he's ponified
<cachi01> she is sexy dancing!
<Kid_Cobalt> Oh Wrek.....haha
<MahBoi777> oh myyyyyy
<CCCP> is he getting a lap dance?
<cachi01> yep
<Scoot|NoNiceThings> 00,03Oh man...
<DeadpoolDash> so...there will be much clopping to this one
<CCCP> 0_0
<MahBoi777> >_<
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Don't think they can pull that off. War Machine's already changed actors once, and the new guy isn't nearly as charismatic as Stark, who...let's face it....is part of the reason Avengers is so GOOD
*Gunthler clops
<Gunthler> :D
<cachi01> the clopping is strong in this one
<Scoot|NoNiceThings> 00,03Shining Armor seems to have a LOT of nice things!
<DaringDude> first to clop?
<RaveBrony> Wait... Wth!?!? How does Wrek get contour lines to work for him?? Omg, on my tablet thats absolute madness to even Attempt contour lines X_x
<Litwick> Damn, that's what a bachelor party is like?

<Darkts33> but cloping is k
<SamanthaGirl159> I do NOT want to know what our Bachelor Party will be like. If it goes anything like this, Ryan's going to need more than his crutches to help him get around
<CCCP> im okay if you clop but i dont want to see it
<Litwick> And NOT accepting cloppers for who they are is hypocritical against what bronies are. Pick your poison.
<Gunthler> CCCP: clops
<CCCP> Gunthler: :|
<MahBoi777> SamanthaGirl159: dayum, seems fair lol

<Kid_Cobalt> CCCP: wait....why would we do that in front of you.....
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: actually, Stark in the films is one of my nitpicks about the Marvel films. He's just...not Tony Stark.
<CCCP> Litwick: i do accept cloppers
<CCCP> Kid_Cobalt: lol
*DaringDude clops all over CCCP
<Litwick> CCCP: I know you ninja'd me as soon as I finished typing it up.
<cachi01> cloppers gonna clop

<Gunthler> ^
<DaringDude> but not really
<twilight_sprinkler> if im in charge of someones bachelors party im going to hire a bunch of quantum physicists and have a lecture for the party

<FlareChaser> Say your shippings! :D
<Gunthler> DeathStar: :D
<DaringDude> :[
<CriticKitten> Still good, damn good. But the weakest.
<MahBoi777> SamanthaGirl159: LOL

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well spike does know hot to throw a bach party
<cachi01> XD
<FlareChaser> Oh god no!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I wouldn't say he's the weakest. He's just the most outright "good" guy. If this were DnD, he'd be Lawful Good, while everyone is is Chaotic Good.
<Darkts33> OH GOD THIS SONG
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> how*
<Litwick> EVERYPONY. Play careless Whisper over this. And laugh.

<Golakka> lol
*MahBoi777 hands CCCP some tissues
<Ryanier128> oh my god . . .
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: He's the weakest by virtue of the least screentime. The new characters got more time because they needed it, Banner got good banter time with Stark....but Capt settles into this leader role that isn't fully established.

<SamanthaGirl159> Ryanier128 YOU'RE STILL HERE?!?
<Aurora> 6a lot of my friends got the collector's edition
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: one of the big things in the comics is that Captain America is the only human with the virtue necessary to pick up Mjollnir
<Aurora> 6which I now kinda wish I bought
<Aurora> 6I actually never read into what it offered
<Chimera> hiroara
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: thats private info..
<Espeon> gotta get the average up a bit to be 3.7 for maximum hilarity
*Espeon hides
*FlareChaser pushes Biglaw away slowly
<TheMaster> Well he never tried in the movie so maybe its still possible
<Ouroboros> SAI seems quite popular of late. Any reason to use it over photoshop/illustrator etc?

<cachi01> FlareChaser: OMGXD
<drfsupercenter> 03Unfortunately, the sales results will probably convince other publishers to opt for "always-on" DRM, but without a good game to back up the awful DRM, gamers may just save their money and get the pirated version instead.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Hulk couldn't pick it up with raw strength, that was the film pointing out that Thor's hammer is enchanted like in the comics. It would have thrown off that narrative if they showed Cap picking it up.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: So then, you still convinced that this isn't Rule 34?
<Ryanier128> yes Samantha159, I'm back and there's nothing you can do about it
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
<TheRainbowDash> Hmm....
<drfsupercenter> 03there you are

<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03*Sonic 4 part 2
<CriticKitten> Remember, this film is as much for people who have NEVER read the comics (like me) as folks who have.
<TheMaster> in cap's hands its just a hammer in the hands of a slightly stronger than normal human

<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I know, but still...geek blue balls.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: it is NOT Rule 34, bc there is no nudity or "acts"

<drfsupercenter> 03>I played it before it was out
<Wrek> 05see the difference?
<RAWRity> that's why it's just a nit pick. I have very few real, legitimate criticisms of the movie. It's mostly just little stuff I would have loved to see in there.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: it's called INNUENDO.

<FlareChaser|L4D2> Eyup
<BlueFlare> 02idiot
<HyperMetalLugia> They don't want to because of piracy

<HyperMetalLugia> Xbox hax0rs
<JanitorVarkian> hmm
<Error37> WHAT U BUYING?
<panda> Sumica: some times its in the front ^^
<otakon> kenne: lol, hey looking forward to RE6?
<TheMaster> as I said before. Trixie either is going to or just got back from a showing of the RHPS.
<WallDives> Ryanier128: then good for you. Not to sound callous, but I dont get attached to anything anymore, you see.
<kenne> so leon talks to himself
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Why? Why did he have to use the blue?!?
<Ryanier128> Sumica they do. A wedding dress is very . . . discomfortable
<kenne> otakon: hell friggin yes!
<otakon> TheMaster: sounds about right
<Dark92Enigma> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN, MY BRAIN.....RED HOT.....STINGING.....PAIN!!!!! -- Ren Hoek
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I am concerned about the bronyfunds challenge. I think people will take off with it in all the wrong ways.
<drfsupercenter> 03no, because Xbox is actually sane and doesn't allow evil DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<otakon> kenne: Dragon's Dogma comes with the demo for it.
<Randomnerd> What the hell is on the screen?
<TheMaster> if I went back to a showing i'd dress up as Brad Majors
<panda> ScooterHax0rNova: because he wants you to imagine and cock block you at the same time ^^
<Ryanier128> according to Samantha
<kenne> otakon: i even bought that craptastic pile of doo doo that is ORC thats how much i like the RE series
<kirzstryfe> 1,3who else want to shoot zombies?
<Wrek> 05me fucking with you Randomnerd
<TheMaster> though maybe i'd go as Riff Raff. Always fun to do the time warp
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Randomnerd: The reason why we can't have nice things
<JanitorVarkian> I do kirzstryfe but only irl
<kenne> otakon: just a demo or a beta?
<JanitorVarkian> so, no
<otakon> kenne: wow, I heard ORC was lackluster, too bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kirzstryfe: I'm firing my PC up.
<otakon> kenne: full demo
<WallDives> otakon: lackluster is being generous.
<Error37> otakon: i thought it was a beta
<CriticKitten> otakon: mfw people know what Dragon's Dogma is
<Sumica> 00,10funny wrek, it looks more like Trixie fucking with meanwhile
<JanitorVarkian> and I dont own the game
<WallDives> I want DD, I cant afford it.
<TheMaster> isn't that fancy pants?
<Randomnerd> Wrek -I not mad :D
<otakon> Error37: nope, it's a full on demo from what i kno
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Oh Wrek, I coulda sworn you were Fucking ME!
<kenne> otakon: i almost wwant to buy dragons dogma now, do you ahve to preorfder it?
<otakon> WallDives: do what I did and trade in stuff to amazon to help cover the cost
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: its funny because in a sense its all of those things fucking with each other.
<DuskStarshimmer> I herd the record skip
<Ryanier128> Sumica that's what they want you to think
<kirzstryfe> 1,3oh blue screen of death, why do you always get in the way of my fun :3
<DuskStarshimmer> Even better angle
<otakon> kenne: no you don't, it's out next tuesday
<JanitorVarkian> why not kirzstryfe
<WallDives> otakon: then I cant participate in tournaments, cause I dont own the games I practice in.
<Ryanier128> . . . why the fuck am I still here?
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Kirz: Because it used the Blue Dye :|
<WallDives> Ryanier128: idk.
<CriticKitten> I did see some footage of Dragon's Dogma, and....eh?
<kenne> otakon: you should give me the demo code

<JanitorVarkian> because you be boredd Ryanier128
<Kid_Cobalt> kirzstryfe: who else is gonna keep your dreams in check?
<otakon> kenne: no, it's MINE DAMMIT!
<Sumica> 00,10wait wut, Game of thrones: the game
<BlueFlare> 02see, the reason I don't want to play it on my PC is because my PC is crap
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, as if that little box could handle the job
<WallDives> otakon: sold those to cover moving expenses for next month. It just isnt happening.
<otakon> Sumica: it's a RPG with Dragon Age like combat

<twilight_sprinkler> sometimes i feel like im the only person who is tired of vulgarness...
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <33
<LadyCanary> O U Shizu
<CriticKitten> It's....kind of neat I guess? Climbing on big monsters IS a cool feature, don't get me wrong. I don't know if it makes up for the fact that you have to stab the monsters COUNTLESS TIMES to kill them.
<otakon> WallDives: well that sucks man, you'l just have to wait
<DeadpoolDash> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/307/430/7eb.gif
<drfsupercenter> 03it's probably just as good as the Wii in other words.
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu :3
<kenne> otakon: well im not going to say a darn thing about the subject
<JanitorVarkian> thats nice twilight_sprinkler
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Game of thrones: The Throne is Blue 
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway bbl shower
<otakon> CriticKitten: well they are HUGE FRIGGIN MONSTERS!
<Randomnerd> What the what?
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<Randomnerd> Whoooooo!
<BlueFlare> 02atleast the wii is met to play games
<LadyCanary> Game of Thrones. ALL THE THRONES.
<CriticKitten> otakon: But you have to stab them even moreso than is rational.
<otakon> Game of THrones: The Game...........
<WallDives> I'm fine with that. Besides, I played Dark Souls. damn near beat it.
<DuskStarshimmer> I get the impression that these two havent commited to any kind of excusive pair bonding.
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03I swear to god, if that condom on her mouth is blue...
<HyperMetalLugia> o.oooo
<cachi01> rule 34: The Game
<panda> cachi01: you make me loose!
*Randomnerd is biggest prude.
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 wrek just removes meanwhile all together from the pick
<BlueFlare> 02at least*
<Ryanier128> ScooterHaxOrNova don't give Wrek any ideas!
<JanitorVarkian> its magenta ScooterHax0rNova
<cachi01> panda: lol
<Phase4> whut.... is... wat
<DuskStarshimmer> oh, i thought that was her tounge
<Phase4> stream
<Phase4> wat
<Ryanier128> wait . . . god damn it
<Chrysalis> Sumica woudlnt really mind, as long as he finishes it
<otakon> CriticKitten: dude, you are fighting GIANTS what did you expect? Especially stuff like Golems who are only vulnerable at specific regions and Chimera's that have mutliple parts to them
*Flaria huggles LadyCanary and Shizuka Shizu Shizu and squees
<CriticKitten> otakon: I watched someone fighting the first big monster of the demo, some sort of griffin. The monster had THREE health bars, and each time the guy stabbed it, the monster lost less than 5% of its health.
<Ryanier128> well, we're fucked
<Shizuka> 13flaria canary <3
<LadyCanary> :D Flaria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<panda> Hey, isnt this considered cheating on trixies and S. Armors part?
<WallDives> Ryanier128: now what?
<Flaria> :3
<cachi01> i will just get dragons dogma for resi 6
<Sumica> 00,10that's not shining armor
<WallDives> also, spike chillin in the back.
<cachi01> spike is pim´´
<panda> Sumica, its not? then who is it?
<DuskStarshimmer> Suddenly solo
<cachi01> pimp
<JanitorVarkian> norly
<otakon> CriticKitten: that's what the pawns are for and why Fire spells kick ass. Hit a enemy with enough of them and they catch on fire, doning consistent damage.
<CriticKitten> The allure of climbing onto the monster RAPIDLY gets old once you realize you're still stabbing it a million damn times to kill it. If you integrate the climbing mechanic with "weak points" for higher damage then fine, it WORKS.
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03Wait I just realized Shining Armor has a blue mane...
<CriticKitten> But it doesn't look like they did.
<Sumica> 00,10Meanwhile supposedly
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<ScooterHax0rNova> 00,03FFFFFUUUUUU-
<kirzstryfe> 1,3inb4 Caramel
<Ryanier128> WallDives I was afraid ScooterHaxOrNova might give Wrek an idea
<panda> Sumica, oh an OC :D
<Sumica> 00,10hahaha
<JanitorVarkian> orly ScooterHax0rNova
<kirzstryfe> 1,3owait, Wrek's already done that one >.>
<BlueFlare> 02my computer can't even play 1602 AD >.>
<panda> Meanwhile is a lucky pony XD
<cachi01> suddenly a pole
<Sumica> 00,10wait he did?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO! No more rule breaking!
<Chrysalis> dat pole
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, yes he did
*DuskStarshimmer suddenly wonders if ponies faces are identifiable without color and mane.
<WallDives> panda: Meanwhile HATES Trixie.
<Chrysalis> is a lucky pole
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03YOU BROKE THE RULES!
<Sumica> 00,10damn I missed that one
<kirzstryfe> 1,3wasn't one he streamed here
<panda> WallDives: WHAT! he hates her? why? D:
<JanitorVarkian> orly WallDives
<otakon> DuskStarshimmer: yeah they are depending on the artist really
<otakon> hiya panda
*Scoot-Scootaloo cries out the chatroom
<panda> Wrek, you are such a troll :D
<WallDives> also, I kinda feel dirty that I want Trixie in Fighting is Magic, but thats me.
<Ryanier128> Scoot-Scootaloo you've gone back to normal! . . . I don't expect it to last very long
<Sumica> 00,10as i said, damn I missed it
<panda> otakon, bout time you said something to me ^^
<CriticKitten> otakon: If you're designing your combat to be realistic then you should try to be consistent about that. If you're allowing me to climb up on a monster's back and shank it in the back of the head, I expect to deal significantly more damage than if I'm stabbing it in the heel.
<otakon> panda: what?
<DuskStarshimmer> otakon, I'll take you work for it and hope its true,
<otakon> CriticKitten: IT'S NOT FRIGGEN REALISTIC!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I.. I can't handle...
<panda> otakon: I said hi to you about 40 minutes ago
<HyperMetalLugia> portal is playable on my laptop
<kirzstryfe> 1,3need 3 people for a L4D2 Vs match, any takers?
<HyperMetalLugia> FPS is decent
<Randomnerd> Actually, using a scar like that *is* kinda hot.
<Randomnerd> scarf*
<DuskStarshimmer> Kirakura, im in
<WallDives> panda: Meanwhile hates Trixie, because he does. his reasons.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Then why bother with the climbing mechanic at all except to look cool?
<CriticKitten> >_>
<otakon> panda: sorry, I'm falling asleep here
<DuskStarshimmer> kirzstryfe,Im in*
<cachi01> Randomnerd x trixie
<panda> otakon: its cool ^^
*LunaTheMaid pokes everypony
<Randomnerd> The Great and Powerful Meanwhile.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3DuskStarshimmer, do I have you on steam?
<otakon> CriticKitten: so you can KILL HUGE THINGS besides just slashing at their kneecaps
<panda> WallDives, well i dont like her either... but for some reason the fandom kinda make me like her ya know?
<DuskStarshimmer> nope just a sec
*Randomnerd has been shipped.
<Ryanier128> Scoot-Scootaloo step away from the monitor and take a few deep breaths. Say "Rock Farm". I swear, it works
<WallDives> panda: to each their own. I dont have a favorite.
<JanitorVarkian> the great and powerful meanwhile x otakon
*Randomnerd removes himself from dat crate.
<otakon> CriticKitten: you can also pick up and throw your own pawns at large enemies, throw enemies at other enemies as well
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Okay... Rock Farm...
<cachi01> JanitorVarkian: dat great and powerful ship
<JanitorVarkian> ikr cachi01
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hmm.. I guess that made me feel a bit better...
<DuskStarshimmer> kirzstryfe http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorsummoner/
<CriticKitten> otakon: The entire reason they added it was to make the fighting seem more real. I *know* it's an RPG and I *know* it can't be 100% realistic, but don't give me the nonsensical excuse that you can have realism in the "climbing" mechanic, but a stab to the monster's head is equal in lethality to a stab to its kneecap.
<panda> WallDives: D: really? ^^ every pony is best pony?
<CriticKitten> Because then you've KILLED the novelty of the climbing.
<JanitorVarkian> thats nice CriticKitten
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03wait... this band...
<CriticKitten> I'll just grab its ankle and slash away, rather than wasting time to climb up to the head. :P
<WallDives> panda: more like they're all at zero. -3+3 is still 0.
<Ryanier128> Scoot-Scootaloo just by saying "Rock Farm" can clear you mind instantly. It works for songs, ideas, and strange converstations you may be having with yourself
<Sumica> 00,10I just noticed my Ogame planet is realy cold
<cachi01> i hear vices
<panda> WallDives, hm.. havent heard that one before XD
<Darkts33> =/
<Sumica> 00,10-35 to 5C
<JanitorVarkian> CriticKitten: are you a game designer? I forget
<otakon> CriticKitten: that is the POINT, a stab to the head DOES do more damage then a stab to the kneecap. I trashed the Griffin in the demo in under 5 minutes bc I climbed on him and smote his feathery head while my blades were aflame.
<BlueFlare> 02EW playing the PC version of Portal
<Sumica> 00,10intersting pic to use for color samples
<HyperMetalLugia> Mouse ftw
<cachi01> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> or touchpad portal
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<panda> and coloring ^^
<otakon> wait............someone here IS a game designer
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That... was really Trixie....
<BlueFlare> 02unless you have one of those gamers PCs
<CriticKitten> The climbing mechanic is cool, don't get me wrong, but it needs to be supplemented with logic. If you expect players to climb up to the head, you really should let them deal more damage than if they slash at the ankles, else it's identical to not having the mechanic at all.
<panda> otakon: you?
<Ryanier128> why was Trixie sitting like Lyra?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03GAHHHH! EVERYONE IS GONNA GET MAD AT US!
<HyperMetalLugia> maybe if you had a half decent laptop
<Ryanier128> only Lyra sits like a human!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO! No more!
<panda> Scoot-Scootaloo: why?
<Phase4> http://www.bronythankyoufund.org/?q=node/9 wow
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm done, goodnight everyone!
<otakon> CriticKitten: I just don't think you noticed it, too busy not trying to fall to your possible death
<otakon> night Scoot-Scootaloo
<WallDives> night Scoot-Scootaloo.
<HyperMetalLugia> cause portal doesn't even need much GPU/CPU power to run
<Ryanier128> bye Scoot-Scootaloo
<Phase4> i cant wait to see where this goes
<cachi01> night Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Bunch of rulebreakers...
<panda> Scoot-Scootaloo: but... dont... oh ok night night ^^
<Airpuff> I'll be taking the night too
<BlueFlare> 02if I can find a game for PS3/xBox I play it on that
<Ryanier128> remember: Rock Farm
<WallDives> Scoot-Scootaloo: oi, I havent done nothin.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03<3
<kirzstryfe> 1,3isn't Meanwhile an Earth pony though?
<panda> Airpuff: night night ^^
<otakon> CriticKitten: play it again and try to NOTICE how much damage attacks to the head do compared to the legs/body.
<Airpuff> Good nigt 'Scoot
<Kid_Cobalt> Scoot-Scootaloo: you know you wanna join us....
<otakon> night Airpuff
<JanitorVarkian> wait, who here is the game designer >.>
<CriticKitten> otakon: I watched someone playing the demo who stabbed the griffin in the head for a very, very long time before it died, and he didn't seem to be doing any more than ankle-level damage. I said SIGNIFICANT. :p
<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe he was in the last pic
<BlueFlare> 02if I had a decent PC maybe not
<Airpuff> enjoy the stream *-*
<Chrysalis> this design is also incredibly similar to his last otakon pic
*Phase4 pokes LunaTheMaid back
<otakon> CriticKitten: well I don't know, everytime I fought it it died damn fast
<otakon> Anyway, I'm off to bed for the night guys

*Ryanier128 doesn't know if he should still be here
<Chrysalis> night otakon
<Ryanier128> bye otakon
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Actually, yes, I am. Guess that disables your pointless aside about how only game developers can critize other developers, eh?
<cachi01> night otakon
<HyperMetalLugia> Well the fact I can play it on an core i3 laptop (Intel HD 2000) means your PC is really bad.
<otakon> See you all tomorrow for the Princess Bride stream hopefully!
<kenne> id hate to see ya leave otakon but seeya
<JanitorVarkian> ddid I say that? CriticKitten?
<BronyCody> night otakom
<panda> otakon: for sure ^^
<BlueFlare> 02um
<JanitorVarkian> I thought I was planning to...
<BronyCody> i mean cachi lol
<otakon> Wrek: MAKE SURE TO FINISH THE BUCK DESIGN DAMMIT!
<cachi01> otakon: see u tomorrow ^^
<HyperMetalLugia> Heck, even my PC's HD Radeon 4350 (Very bad) is better than the intel
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: No but you rather heavily implied it.
<otakon> bye all!
<cachi01> BronyCody: lol
<otakon> kenne: I'm tired and it's late
<panda> cachi01, um... was scoot really that mad?
<Ryanier128> are they showing all the movies twice? I have to go to University tomorrow and the movies start at 11:00 am here
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Nittany_Discord, if you want in, one spot left
<otakon> :) bye all take care!
*LunaTheMaid giggles
<cachi01> panda: naah it was scoot being a silly filly
<Cobellanez> HRRNNGG
<kenne> otakon: ive seen you up to 2 before, much much much later than it is now
*panda hugs ot--- aww
<BlueFlare> 02any computer that has a i3 processor is pretty good
<JanitorVarkian> I only asked you CriticKitten because I thought that you were one >.>
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Basically dismissing my argument with "lol but you don't make games". Except that a) I do in my spare time as a volunteer, and b) that has nothing to do with my ability to criticize a feature in a game. :p
<Cobellanez> I'll go if Nittany doesn't want to
<panda> cachi01, oh, is his drawing breaking the rules or something?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2.13 ghz, not very good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Give me 5 mins.
<cachi01> panda: wellll it has sexual content
<HyperMetalLugia> 3CPU: Intel Core i3 M 330, 2.13 GHz, 0 KB (6% Load)
<cachi01> panda: and pimp spike
<panda> cachi01, so if he erases the condom, its fine? right?
<cachi01> panda: and the lingirie
<BlueFlare> 02it's not all about how much ghz it has
<cachi01> panda: i think lol
<BlueFlare> 02mine is 3.20 ghz
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Again though, it doesn't matter. It's a silly feature unless it works properly. If I still have to shank the griffin fifty times in the head to kill it, I'm not sure I'm getting a very good deal. :p
<panda> cachi01 oh... haha but shes just wearing a corsette so nopony sees her rolls ^^
<JanitorVarkian> CriticKitten: I wasnt sure if you were a game designer, and then had a greater insight in the industry. I didnt mean to offend >.>
<cachi01> panda: xd
<cachi01> wow 140 ponies connected and just 20 are talking lol
<Sumica> 00,10ever notice no one cares if a pony is nude, but if you start puting clothing on them.....
<CriticKitten> Granted you can't make it kill the thing in one shot. I know that. But fifty times....yeahno, that's just not fun. :P
<BlueFlare> 02and it's just a Celoron D
<WallDives> dat perception.
<SCChappy> hello
<panda> cachi01, well... to me its like this: If it doesnt make me erm... you know... its fine with me lol
<cachi01> Sumica: maybe being dressed for them is like being naked for us
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: I suppose I'll let you off the hook this once. :p
<HyperMetalLugia> I was talking about compared to any i3, not another line.
<Kandarihu> Yeah. That is wierd
<JanitorVarkian> indeed
<cachi01> panda: oooooo i know what u mean lol
<HyperMetalLugia> And Celeron sucked in general
<HyperMetalLugia> Same with P4
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<DeadpoolDash> once they go anthro all bets are off
<panda> cachi01: but the pole makes it even more suggestive...
<Darkts33> =/ how did this change from a sitting pony to a pole?
<Sumica> 00,10so that meens canterlot is full of a bunch of fetishist. and deveants.
<cachi01> panda: yeah O_O
<panda> Sumica: O_O THEY ARE?
<Cobellanez> I'm okay with that Sumica
<WallDives> or that Ponyville is a nudist colony.
<Ingwaz> Sumica: just liek real life!
<Sumica> 00,10Darkts33, the magic of layers
<Darkts33> Sumica: ya
<cachi01> thats sluttyville
<BlueFlare> 02but i3, i5 and i7 are pretty awesome
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: But, again, some of the best opinions tend to come from those who haven't developed games, honestly.
<panda> Hey you guys... I'll be back in 30 minutes, I have to get something to eat kk?
<Ryanier128> brb
<cachi01> k panda
<Ingwaz> mmmm ponyville nudist colony...giggity
<Sumica> 00,10bye bye panda
<WallDives> panda: chat isnt going anywhere, hopefully.
<panda> Sumica: well not leaving... just getting a burger ^^
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: You can hear a lot of good feedback from people who haven't made games but have just played an awful lot of 'em. Because they know what people will like.
*cachi01 watches how chat gets legs and starts walking
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam is borking on me.
<panda|Burgers> :D
<cachi01> v3
<JanitorVarkian> ok CriticKitten
<Azuredragon> hurray for gmod ponies
<twilight_sprinkler> it would be funny if he turned the pole into a lampost, gave trixie an umbrella and turned her into mary popins
<Phase4> hmmmm
*Phase4 pokes LunaTheMaid again
<Kandarihu> Well, Wrek is clearly drawing sexual attire on Trixie. And of course, the clothing the elites of Canterlot as seen in the cartoon are not sexual in nature.
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Personally, I like discussing game design, it's a hell of a lot of fun. :P
*LunaTheMaid giggles again
<Phase4> for science!
<JanitorVarkian> so.... CriticKitten are ypu a Critic or something like that?
<JanitorVarkian> *you
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda liked it better when it was a lap dance =p
<CriticKitten> I'm cynical and critical, yes.
<Wrek> 05couldnt be assed sketchign the colt too :P
<CriticKitten> Which is why nopony will ever love me. :D

<WallDives> CriticKitten: fanboys might. but they never count.
<LunaTheMaid> That tickles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek can't do colts?
<JanitorVarkian> yeah, I like discussing game design, but I dont know a whole hell of a lot about it... except that which I do >.>
<Chrysalis> i'll be in my bunk
<Randomnerd> lol
<Randomnerd> Spike is pimping.
<cachi01> then it went boom
<Sumica> 00,10understandable wrek.
<cachi01> ok kids what did we learned from this episode?
<JanitorVarkian> well, CriticKitten Im sure you'll find some other cynical, critical bastard that'll slightly like you >.>.... not sure if that was a complement or not
<Biglaw> pie is yummy
<Ryanier128> I'm back. What did I miss?
<SunderlandPony89> cachi01: Trixie is sexiest poni?
<Sumica> 00,10Honistly I figured that would be the case some time ago when I said einb4 you replace em with a poll
<cachi01> uhmmmm yeaah
<CriticKitten> Nonsense. :p
<cachi01> but also
<WallDives> cachi01: that if Trixie gives me a lapdance, she will be best pony, no exceptions?
<cachi01> we learned that lingirie is expensive
<Ryanier128> . . . not much I see
<cachi01> WallDives: yeah also
<WallDives> Ryanier128: you were hoping for something different?
<cachi01> and so trixie has a lingirie spell
<Ryanier128> WallDives the only reason I'm here is because the chat is hysterical
<Sumica> 00,10needs more stockings
<Ryanier128> so yes
<WallDives> this may or may not be true.
<twilight_sprinkler> oh joy, matlab likes to die from critical errors too
<JanitorVarkian> norly Ryanier128
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Cobellanez> Stockins mmmm
<Chrysalis> inb4 garter belt
<Cobellanez> stockings*
<Rain> my god, Wrek is still drawing? :O
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Not concerned about it anyways. As I said, CK ships with no one. There's a reason for that. :p
*JanitorVarkian is in a constant state of explosion
<cachi01> i think Wrek should add audience
<Kid_Cobalt> Rain: Problem with that??????
<JanitorVarkian> thats fun CriticKitten
<JanitorVarkian> not really though
<Ryanier128> Sumica don't give Wrek any ideas! We narrowly avoided that with Scoot-Scootaloo
<phobos2390> I'm playing Call of Duty 2 for the first time.
<Sumica> 00,10but I have great ideas
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: Sweet. It's a pretty good CoD game
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 4Caterpie.
<Rain> no, Kid_Cobalt. You miss understood me. I love it when Wrek draws. Im surpriesed that I am lucky enough for him to still be drawing after having to be away for so long
<phobos2390> This is the first fps game I have ever played. I got it on steam today.
<Ryanier128> Sumica nobody has only good ideas
<cachi01> phobos2390: im s sorry phobos.....
<Darkts33> Phobos2390: that was the time when Infinity Ward's ppl wasnt fired
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<JanitorVarkian> why did you choose cod 2 for the first fps to play?
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: Congrats man. I would also reccomend CoD4. Best CoD game EVER
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if there is audience, there should be one pony with a trench coat, hat and an obvious moustache
<Sumica> 00,10true but i keep the bad ideas to my self
<cachi01> phobos2390: im so sorry u had to start with a great game...
<JanitorVarkian> thats tootally not subjective SunderlandPony89
<Kid_Cobalt> Rain: And you misunderstand me. Regardless of what your respponse was I would have responded back jokingly and light heartedly ^-^
<Shizuka> 13aww it broke up the dream team again :<
<cachi01> and will end with the deception of its followers..
*Ryanier128 facepalms
<JanitorVarkian> *spelling
<SunderlandPony89> JanitorVarkian: Yeah, it's not
<WallDives> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but I would be too obvious...
<CriticKitten> JanitorVarkian: Actually it's fine AFAIC. Don't have time for that sort of thing, and can't afford it either. My college debts will own me until the day I die, most likely. :p
<Sumica> 00,10that sucks Shizuka.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wanted to play with Shizuka :<

<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Rain> what?
<phobos2390> cachi01: I just haven't ever felt the need to until now. Technically it is not the first fps I've ever played but it's the first fps I have personally purchased and played.
<CriticKitten> Okay, can't resist.

*LadyCanary hugs Rain <3
*Ryanier128 glomps Rain
<phobos2390> cachi01: I don't plan on playing them. I'm really just looking into these games just to say that I have given FPS's a try. I am enjoying the game currently. I just don't think it is going to be the only game I will ever play.
*Ryanier128 and LadyCanary
*Rain isnt sure if she knows Ryanier128
<HyperMetalLugia> xxXRorauroraXxx
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat obvious pony in the audience xD also is that epic sax spike ?
<phobos2390> *again
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: If you can, I'd HIGHLY reccomend Bioshock for an FPS
<Glacymr> hi HyperMetalLugia
<cachi01> my city just got a little shake}
<Aurora> noooo
<Kosoveon> o-o
<Aurora> I might just use sareii
<Aurora> but I want something more
<Wrek> 05i highly recommend Deus Ex as a good FPRPG
<Aurora> gameish
<cachi01> or skyrim
<Kid_Cobalt> cachi01: Damit who divided by zero in your city???
<BlueFlare> 02Diasareii

<DeathStar> cachi01: sry I didn't mean to party that hard
<Ponies47> I DID!
<phobos2390> Hmm...I'm not sure yet. I'll try to get back to you once I am done with Call of Duty 2. I purchased it along with the original.
<Aurora> please tell me you're joking lol...
<flutter_spin> I'm back gu.... HELLO!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my sight is gettin bad, the sing reads "not meanwhile" ?
<cachi01> Kid_Cobalt: xDDD its funny cause yesterday i was oh uhmm........oh shit

<SunderlandPony89> flutter_spin: SEXY TRIXIE!
<Litwick> And there's Meanwhile in the trenchcoat.
<Ryanier128> Rain you probably don't, so I'll give you a quick description: I'm Canadian and SamanthaGirl159 is my new fiance who I proposed to on Sunday. We were both in a car crash on Monday that left me in crutches
<DeathStar> hi flutter_spin
<Rain> I highly recommend Wrek streams to help pass the time and learn what good art is.
<phobos2390> I have a question. What is United offensive?
<Sumica> 00,10Dem bits
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica i asked the same thing :p
<BlueFlare> 02nono, diablo9001
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: Erhm, in what context?

<LadyCanary> Ryanier128: Sorry that happened to you. But mfw you're engaged?!
<flutter_spin> I hope so. I was quite surprised at the number of things I DID RIGHT! :P
<BlueFlare> 02I don't see anything wrong gerneric names. I just find them funny :x
<Ponies47> Cya RaveBrony!
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: I purchased the War chest pack (don't quote me on that) and got the original, 2, and united offensive.
<Aurora> they're awwful
<Randomnerd> Ryanier128: Holy crap, that's awful! Feel better

<TheMaster> wrek do you have Justice?
<cachi01> nooooooooo the techno IT BURNS
<cachi01> only techno son i like is invaders must die
*Rain bobs to the beat
<cachi01> song*
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: Probably. Maybe a spin-off.
<Sumica> 00,10so what would you call a pony "strip" club?
<BlueFlare> 02EW weeaboos
<LadyCanary> Wubwubwub
<Kandarihu> Hey, I like this better than some of the regular music that he plays.
<flutter_spin> lol, thanks Sumi.
<Ryanier128> she was so stressed this week
<cachi01> Sumica: hay strip club
<TheMaster> Saddles
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Pony Dress Club

<Ingwaz> Ryanier128: blazing saddles sounds like they all have stds
<Sumica> 00,10lol no I meen cause they seem to put on clothing to become sausy
<Litwick> Sumica: A Dress Club
<Biglaw> Wrek one word to describe the drawing, BuckingAwesome
<Sumica> 00,10instead of striping
<Ryanier128> Ingwaz I'm drunk
<WallDives> Saucy Mares.
<Ingwaz> Ryanier128: no excuses!
<Sumica> 00,10and yes wrek I like that name
<cachi01> DeathStar: not a fan of beatles..... but thx!! lol
<LadyCanary> Strippers remind me of that one joke Chris Rock makes about them.
<Wrek> 05owned and run by cleptospike
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: Not to sure it would be a spin-off, probably just an expansion pack type game of some kind
<JanitorVarkian> thats... good? I guess Ryanier128?
<cachi01> strippers remind me of....
<CriticKitten> Oh, you want a club name? Hm, can't use "Dizzy Donkey" since that's my idea for a pony-based pub....
<cachi01> strippers
<TheMaster> Obviously ponies find clothes kinky. Maybe they're 'dressers'
<Aurora> I need to mop first
<JanitorVarkian> I hear canadians do that Ryanier128
<Biglaw> cachi01 :|
<Aurora> then I'll decide
<Ryanier128> stfu Ingwaz I'm drunk, crippled, and engaged
<LadyCanary> Also Panty and Stocking. Stripper magical girls. LOL.
<Sumica> 00,10if that's keptospike where is his hat?
<Ingwaz> i like TheMaster's idea
<DeathStar> cachi01: your welcome and you clearly haven't herd run for your life
<WallDives> Ryanier128: the good news is that two of those are your fault.
<cachi01> DeathStar: no i havnt
<TheMaster> and considering how many clothes rarity wears...
<cachi01> lol
<Ryanier128> we do JanitorVarkian. My best friend is a Newfie

<Sumica> 00,10then again she does have alot of saddles and bridles
<TheMaster> You know, I suddenly want to see a fully grown spike wearing a scaled up version of his pimp hat
<WallDives> someone needs to write this.
<BlueFlare> 02drf, you would be surprised
*DeathStar dances on Ryanier128 s head
<flutter_spin> uh oh. I think I had too many wheat thins. I'm getting sick to my stomach
<Biglaw> See ya later FlareChaser|L4D2!
<Ryanier128> JanitorVarkian a Newfie is somebody from Newfoundland. They're the "Crazy Drunk Sex Party" people

<Sumica> 00,10WallDives, I am sure it's been done.
<Ingwaz> Sumica: why do you think she was so eager to get twilight in to that saddle?
<Biglaw> flutter_spin I can eat a whole box. they're bucking awesomde
<JanitorVarkian> I want to know those people Ryanier128
<WallDives> probably.

<SunderlandPony89> flutter_spin: Not really.
<Biglaw> Wait, if clothing is saucy, does that make Canterlot Vegas?
<Kid_Cobalt> must resist clopping urge......
<Kid_Cobalt> Biglaw: that was kind of a left field response but thanks for the input anyways I suppose.
<Sumica> 00,10guess we now know what trixie has been up to sence loseing her showcart.
<DeathStar> flutter_spin: only wih ponys
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: I'll think about it. For now, all I want to do is play a few FPS's to get more of a feel for the genre.
<TheMaster> When Trixie returns I wonder what EQD will look like
<cachi01> phobos2390: crysis is a really nice fps
<Sumica> 00,10nah they already have a pony vegas
<flutter_spin> I'm glad I didn't go with that Sumi in my fic
<Biglaw> Kid_Cobalt I love wheat thins. :)
<flutter_spin> I've said too much.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat is totally not meanwhile
<Golakka> If seth finds out about this, Game over man, game over!
<JanitorVarkian> me too Biglaw
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: Ya' gotta use whatcha got to get whatcha want in this world kid..
<Ryanier128> JanitorVarkian I feel sorry for you. Newfies don't take a kind look to America. They think you always think of them as "Canada's Jersey Shore", which is totally false. The day you see a Newfie Fistpump is the day a man from B.C. turns Redneck-Nazi and moves to Toronto
<Sumica> 00,10might have been funny flutter_spin
<Rain> Wrek, this is looking glorious
<flutter_spin> Yeah but *puts hoof in mouth* comes after
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: Kewl, kewl. Plenty of FPS I can reccomend and plently I can advise you to stay away
<SunderlandPony89> ...from
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica well she is a showmare
<Kid_Cobalt> Biglaw: well dont eat too many guy, or your gonna get a wicked bad tummy ache.
<WallDives> I want to go back up to Canada...
<Wrek> 05oh look
<TheMaster> well Trixie is a showmare. She didn't say all she did was be a stage magician.
<Wrek> 05their new album is out
<Golakka> The only FPS you ever need, battlefield 2
<Wrek> 05lets listen to it
<JanitorVarkian> I didnt even know that newfoundland was like that Ryanier128, so no I dont think of them like that
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: Yeah...
<TheMaster> Justice? Cross album?
<Sumica> 00,10gonna be hard to find a good color for her outfit.
<flutter_spin> And then there is the part with Wrek... uhhhh .... well he does stuff
<Litwick> Trixie chillin like a villain
<Biglaw> Kid_Cobalt I am Biglaw, I shall eat as many as I want! :D
<Ryanier128> WallDives you left? Mah gawd . . .
<Azuredragon> TheMaster , yeah, It was completly Treixiefied just from that small mention from Rainbow Dash. imagine a WHOLE episode
<Golakka> I like the way this tune huts my ears its that loud
<WallDives> Ryanier128: I only went up there to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame. (I'm still a America, although who knows for how long)
<Kid_Cobalt> Biglaw: then grab some cider and a box of those wheat thins and bro hoof me /)
<WallDives> American^
<TheMaster> I just want them to give the nod for 12 additional episodes for season 3.
*cachi01 touches trixie
<Sumica> 00,10sounds......kinky flutter_spin
<TheMaster> Then I will be happy
<cachi01> DAMMIT ITS HOT
<JanitorVarkian> you are on america WallDives ?
<JanitorVarkian> *one
*Biglaw brohooves Kid_Cobalt, and shares some wheat thins
<flutter_spin> Its rated E if you really want to know, but I've caught what I wrote to sound... saucy sometimes
<Ryanier128> JanitorVarkian yeah, you would be surprised. I suggest reading "How To Be Canadian *even if you are already one"
<Sumica> 00,10honistly TheMaster, I am sure it's already in the works
<Ryanier128> so funny
<Randomnerd> TheMaster: I'm buying as much as I can!
<TheMaster> I know but. ;-; my heart can't go on being unsure.
<Sumica> 00,10I just cant see them dumping Studio B like that
<Ponies47> How episode's are there gonna be in season 3?
<flutter_spin> Besides Wrek goes on about ... I mean , he says stuff
<BlueFlare> 02[21:17] <%drfsupercenter> yes, but >false positives <-- yay norton?
*BlueFlare hides
<drfsupercenter> 03EW NORTON
<Kid_Cobalt> flutter_spin: so erotic then right? I mean if your gonna say sausy why not go ahead and go the whole 9 yards?
<TheMaster> 20 whatever hours of content ISN'T ENOUGH
<Randomnerd> I regret not participating and donating MLP stuff to Toys for Tots.
<Biglaw> Ima go see if I have wheat thins :3
<flutter_spin> lol Kid....
<Sumica> 00,10we know they have at leat 13 eps in the works and that studio B is not doing them
<flutter_spin> LOL Biglaw
<Ryanier128> has anypony here taken on the Ultimate Brony Challenge?
<Rain> D:
<WallDives> no.
<TheMaster> wait. what? studio b isn't doing episodes anymore?
<TheMaster> what!?
<WallDives> dont have time...
<JanitorVarkian> what?
<cachi01> Ryanier128: nope where can i found it?
<SunderlandPony89> Biglaw: I'd reccomend Triscits. Much better :)
<Glacymr> ew everything escape MalWareBytes
<BlueFlare> 02Norton is pretty good. It just cost way too much money now for what it is
<cachi01> find*
<DeadpoolDash> dhx
<Rain> Sumica, Studio B isnt doing them? :<
<Glacymr> except
<Ponies47> Sumica: :O Then who is!?!
<Rain> that makes me sad..
<Sumica> 00,10no I am just taking of what is confermed TheMaster
<Randomnerd> I cannot get that much time alone.
<BlueFlare> 02>$80
<flutter_spin> confirmed WHERE
<phobos2390> So far, I am enjoying Cod2 and am satisfied.
<Ryanier128> cachi01 look it up. It's on "My Little Brony", a section on Memebase dedicated to MLP
<JanitorVarkian> give me source
<drfsupercenter> 03Norton is absolutely awful
<cachi01> Ryanier128: thx
<Sumica> 00,10fffffff, you all are gonna make me go look it up on eqd arnt you.
<BlueFlare> 02why do you think that? Xd
<Ryanier128> and since when did Studio B stop doing MLP?
<TheMaster> normally it takes seasons of time for them to get rid of all the original creators who made a show great. how could they do such evil things? why does the hub and hasbro hate money and fame?
<JanitorVarkian> yes we are Sumica
<drfsupercenter> 03because it doesn't detect anything?
<Rain> since season 3 apparently
<Ryanier128> WAIT I TAKE IT BACK!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> Mcafee is horrible
<Sumica> 00,10no one said they stoped
<flutter_spin> I once freaked when I read "Rainbow Dash VA isn't going..." and then I realized they meant something else
<drfsupercenter> 03and the only stuff it DOES detect isn't a virus
<Litwick> I beleive ya Sumica.
<Ryanier128> . . . shit, too late
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, Norton and McAfee are equally garbage
<Kid_Cobalt> Rain: then have some cider and some decent convo with your fellow bronys and "smile smile smile, fill the world up with sunshine sunshine"
<Sumica> 00,10I said what we know
<BlueFlare> 02EW Mcafee
<phobos2390> I dunno though. I think overall, the FPS genre is overrated. I am just enjoying this game.
<Biglaw> Alas, I have no wheat thins...
<flutter_spin> I still can't believe the reference of MLP in Diablo 3
<BlueFlare> 02Norton 360 does drf
<JanitorVarkian> wait, waht Ryanier128
<Rain> Kid_Cobalt, what the hell are you talking about..?
<phobos2390> Biglaw: Hahahahaha
<Sumica> 00,10the rumor mill is saying that we will get 26, 13 from new company and 13 from studio B
<drfsupercenter> 03No
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't
<BlueFlare> 02donno about other types of Norton
<TheMaster> why would they dump studio B though?
<Sumica> 00,10No one said they did
<flutter_spin> any milky ways Biglaw ?
<TheMaster> Are they keeping the music people? the animators?
<Kid_Cobalt> Rain: pfff.....i'll be honest. I don't even know anymore.
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- <drfsupercenter> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ANDROID <drfsupercenter> LOL <drfsupercenter> Good for you, you know how to abuse scripts
<BlueFlare> 02Norton 360 never comes with PCs btw
*DeathStar dances on TheMaster s head
<HyperMetalLugia> Norton= Waste of space
<TheMaster> If I had a ti..stop that deathstar
<Ponies47> Sumica: hmm These other poeple better do a good job! :[
<Biglaw> flutter_spin what? is that an american snack?
<HyperMetalLugia> Mcafee- Waste of space and slows your PC down
<BlueFlare> 02^
<Kosoveon|Writing> this argument=waste of time
<Kosoveon|Writing> :P
<Aurora> ^that
<Litwick> Wait.... a new company animating the first half of the season?
<drfsupercenter> 03Real pros don't even need antiviruses, LOL
<DeathStar> TheMaster: but but :'(
<WallDives> its a candy bar, Biglaw.
<Ryanier128> JanitorVarkian I don't know, I just felt like doing something like that to see the reactions
<drfsupercenter> 03just don't download random 30kb exe files that appear to be music
<drfsupercenter> 03and you shoudl be good
<TheMaster> Do you want to get erased out of time and space?
<JanitorVarkian> so, no confirmation sumica?
<JanitorVarkian> >.>
<Kandarihu> This is going to be a high-stakes experiment in consistancy
<CCCP> :(
<Biglaw> Well I has no candy
<Wrek> 05yay or neigh on the hat?
<Bluestrom_S> Wrek your art skills have improved, I'm proud
<Biglaw> :(
<Ryanier128> TheMasters can you do that?
<Ponies47> Only 1 problem she cleans them with wubs.
<BlueFlare> 02drf, things happen
<Litwick> This is sounding..... interesting.
<TheMaster> I can do that you know. I'm mag..time lord.
<cachi01> g2g everypony night!!!!!!!!
<Rain> hmm
<Litwick> YES THE HAT.
<Azuredragon> yay
<drfsupercenter> 03but with the amount of porn sites BlueFlare goes to, I understand why he wants one
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ryanier128> bye cachi01
<CCCP> night cachi01
<Rain> Wrek zoom it out so we can see her whole body
<DeathStar> TheMaster: no :(
<Biglaw> Oh Hi CCCP! *glomps*
<NickleBack> Good evening everypony
<SunderlandPony89> Trixie has a hat now? At least she knows how to play TF2 now
<Ponies47> Goodnight cachi01!
<Litwick> KEEP THE HAT. BECAUSE IT'LL PISS OFF MEANWHILE.
<BlueFlare> 02:|
<Ryanier128> hi NickleBack
<CCCP> NIGHT NickleBack
<Rain> lol
<phobos2390> Anyway, I'm going to have to brb. I have to do something.
<BlueFlare> 02stop calling yourself BlueFlare
<Ponies47> Night NickleBack
*BlueFlare hides
<flutter_spin> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L3V3S1wjpdw/TMLbt2qDfkI/AAAAAAAAAR4/dkkrL6dcvd0/s1600/milkywayfunsize.jpg you know... Milky Ways
<DeathStar> hi NickleBack
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: Considering that putting on clothing is the equivalent of taking it off in "pony stripping" Im gonna go with yay..
<Sumica> 00,10hat is a nice touch
<drfsupercenter> 03your jokes are bad and you should feel bad
<NickleBack> Greets to all
<Sumica> 00,10also it lets you know who it is
<flutter_spin> have her outfit on the ground by that dude, Wrek
<TheMaster> So obviously the height of sensuality in equestria is wearing a burqa.
<Randomnerd> Oy. dat pony.
<NickleBack> DeathStar, CCP, Ryanier128 howdy
<CCCP> :(
<Sumica> 00,10still say needs stockings
<Ryanier128> NickleBack I suggest running. For your sanity. Now
<Kosoveon|Writing> also, how is Diablo III, rawra?
<Kandarihu> TheMaster: lol
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: cutie mark doesnt give it away?
*DeathStar dances on NickleBack s head
<Biglaw> CCCP I feel broken :p
<TheMaster> Mareabia is the kinkiest land in equestria
<Ryanier128> I lost mine a long time ago
<CCCP> Biglaw: :(
<Rain> if there is a new company doing the first half, and studio b doing the second half, then that means that each company can spend more time on their half than having to split it up. Quality increse predicted by Rain.
<Randomnerd> Arabian is a breed of horse, ya know
<Ponies47> Fixes Biglaw
<Rain> rather than*
<Ryanier128> Rain that's actually a good idea
<Biglaw> CCCP I tripped and scraped my knee and pulled a muscle in my left shoulder :(
*Randomnerd would be a donkey
<TheMaster> Yes, but its not punny enough just being 'arabia' since its also called that here
<Kandarihu> This is some nice techno, but I got to go soon
<NickleBack> What kind of magic is this?
<Rain> sexy magic
<Sumica> 00,10at a glance Kid_Cobalt
<CCCP> that sucks Biglaw :(
<BlueFlare> 02Not all viruses/malware is user error
*DeathStar dances on NickleBack s head
<Randomnerd> Saddle Marabia?
<bluesun> 3Well even stuff like firefox has antivirus nowadays
<Rain> its the magic of Wrek, the sexiest and most powerful magic there is.
<Ryanier128> if only meanwhile were here . . .
<Kid_Cobalt> Randomnerd: and grannysmith was the name of a brand new baby filly. interesting facts deserves interesting responses. ~Kid
<TheMaster> The Saddle family has ruled in Mareabia for generations.
<drfsupercenter> 03I beg to differ, BlueFlare
<Biglaw> CCCP it does, can't really move my shoulder too much without it hurting
<Kid_Cobalt> quite.
<CCCP> :(
<BlueFlare> 02are*
<NickleBack> Ryanier128 I already lost my sanity :P
<Randomnerd> Oh, my... I cannot remember all the bad puns we made a few months back. we must have had 40 or more lame jokes.
<Sumica> 00,10gonna take me a bit to find this info on eqd
<Ryanier128> Biglaw what happened to you?
<Kandarihu> I was honestly thinking imagining what the opening to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic might look like if it were made to be Sharia compliant.
<TheMaster> all the ponies are depraved and hedonistic. They wear full burqas.
<WallDives> I have my sanity.
<WallDives> because being insane got boring.
<CCCP> im so sadz
<Biglaw> Ryanier128 an intense game of grounders and tripping in a parking lot :p
<TheMaster> I don't think they'd approve.
<Ingwaz> Sumica: what info you looking for?
<TheMaster> since...celestia and all
<Ponies47> I'VE LOST ALL SANITY! :P
<NickleBack> expoded
<Wrek> 05so much wub :|
<FlareChaser> uhh
*FlareChaser explodes
<Randomnerd> Derpy is not crazy! She's just clumsy.
<Biglaw> hi FlareChaser! *cleans up remains*
<Ryanier128> Biglaw that is so much fun when your drunk
<Randomnerd> And we <3 her.
<Sumica> 00,10trying to find the post where it says 13 eps for s 3 confermed and it's not studio B doing them
*DeathStar hands Ponies47 some sanity "I found this under the couch"
<FlareChaser> DID SOMEONE SAY DRUNK? did they?
<Biglaw> Ryanier well I'm not of drinking age, so I wouldn't know
<WallDives> I was trying to find that too...
<CCCP> :(
<drfsupercenter> 03Ad Muncher makes a better anti-malware than actual antivirus programs
<Ponies47> I have decided to explode *explodes*
<Biglaw> FlareChaser Ryanier128 did
<NickleBack> This is some sexy Dupstep
<Chrysalis> can't wait to see this when finished
*Randomnerd must not get drunk and sing the "Find A Pet" song at the Hey Ocean concert in NYC
<Sumica> 00,10problem is every one asumes that meeens studio B is out rather then jsut being more secretive and doing their own 13 eps
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: does this mean I can get drunk now?
<Biglaw> FlareChaser no, you are angry drunk.
<NickleBack> Does anyone know the artist or the song?
<Ryanier128> FlareChaser I'm drunk
<TheMaster> dat netflix
<TheMaster> THEY KNOW
<Aurora> koso, i haven't started
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: whooo said that? I am already druuuunk!
<DeathStar> Randomnerd: I think you accedently added not in that sentence
<Aurora> I just installed it
<WallDives> Ryanier128: not drunk enough!
<Ingwaz> Sumica: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/top-draw-production-board-includes.html
<Aurora> now I'm trying to come up with a decent battlenet tag
<Kandarihu> Well, it's the whole irony that combines a religious law that treats women as 2nd class citizens with a world that is prodominantly female. I honestly don't think there will be too many people comfortable about this.
<Biglaw> FlareChaser *facehoof*
<BlueFlare> 02besides, I bet the reason HML thinks i3 processors are slow is because he has so many viruses on his PC from not having anything installed on it :P
<Aurora> plus, I've no idea which class to use
<Ponies47> DeathStar: Thanks. But I'm still grossed out by a fanfic I just listened to a reading of 0_0
<CCCP> ugh :(
<drfsupercenter> 03no, i3 processors *are* slow
<FlareChaser> ...dat sexy mare.
<Aurora> i'm torn between Wizard, Monk, and Witch Doctor
<FlareChaser> mm
<Sumica> 00,10Thanks Ingwaz
<Randomnerd> DeathStar: looooool
<drfsupercenter> 03i5 and i7 are good... i3 is the little sister version
<Kosoveon|Writing> ah ok
<Ingwaz> Sumica: i think thats what you're looking for. and actually i saw a lot of people saying just what you were saying about it
<DeathStar> Ponies47: oh dear
<Biglaw> FlareChaser I got hurt today :(
<Kosoveon|Writing> Witch doctor lolol
<TheMaster> You know. I organized with my suitemates, repeated pizza parties up to 12-13 college people to watch my little pony all night. It was suprisingly succesful
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: hows that?
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah
<Ryanier128> WallDives Samantha won't let me :'(
<Aurora> ^lol
<Kosoveon|Writing> that one sounds legit
<flutter_spin> Wow, how did I miss that post?
<Ryanier128> that pissed her off
<Aurora> witch doctor looks awesome
<Ponies47> DeathStar: I gotta stay away from the bad ones :P
<Aurora> but so does monk
*WallDives sighs
<Aurora> and as for magician, dunno I feel like that would be fun
<flutter_spin> I was searching for it too Sumi. I guess its an obscure posting
<Biglaw> FlareChaser well, pain isn't the funnest thing, but I guess it's better than chores
<BlueFlare> 02well yeah, but he makes them out to be really slow and I've used demos that have it on them before
<Aurora> ...
<Aurora> wizard
<Sumica> 00,10I just cant see them dumping a company doing such a good job so honistly I belive it will be two companys makeing 13 eps each
<Aurora> esrdtfhg
<drfsupercenter> 03can't you just switch whenever you want?
<Ponies47> DeathStar: BUT I CAN'T! :[
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: hey chapter 11 is out! imma go read it! :D
<Sumica> 00,10Ingwaz posted it for us
<Wrek> 05and that concludes the rough sketch
<NickleBack> Wow that is some impressive art mate :D
<TheMaster> two companies? oh god, double the pony?
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: all i did was search for season 3 in the search bar on eqd
<Sumica> 00,10color time wrek?
<Biglaw> FlareChaser you do that
<Kandarihu> AFAIK, it means that when outside, women are REQUIRED to wear burqas at all times and they have to have a male escort.
<LadyCanary> It looks fantastic Wreky :3
<DeathStar> Ponies47: oh silly filly
<Rain> <3 Wrek <3
<HyperMetalLugia> Nightseas
<TheMaster> I wouldn't mind hour+ long pony specials ala doctor who
<TheMaster> like the season finale
<HyperMetalLugia> I've had this laptop since Sept 2010
<HyperMetalLugia> and no viruses
<HyperMetalLugia> ever.
<Randomnerd> lol poor meanwhile
<Ponies47> DeathStar: I know :(
<Azuredragon> will this be posted on devientart?
<HyperMetalLugia> No active anti-virus either
<HyperMetalLugia> so
<Aurora> drf, no
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: Will you be drawing again tomorrow and if so when?
<flutter_spin> I have a tendency not to believe everything that goes on EQD :P
<Sumica> 00,10meanwhile got replaced with a poll
<Derpy_Hooves88> wut did i just pop in on?
<Ryanier128> TheMaster who didn't like the Season Finale?
<TheMaster> nobody, thats who
<WallDives> Derpy_Hooves88: greatness.
<Sumica> 00,10that is a good stance flutter_spin
<drfsupercenter> 03like you can't just make a new character if you get bored?
<Aurora> unless you were asking that to something else
<BlueFlare> 02how would you know HML? some viruses hide
<Aurora> oh ok
<Aurora> you can
<Sumica> 00,10but generaly if they link a source check it out
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: Dick Y R I NOT IN THIS?
<Ingwaz> Sumica: while i see the logic in your argument, i also see the potential reasoining in the argument that it might just go to 65 eps and stop as that is apparently the trend. While i am hopeful, ia m also concerned
<Kandarihu> I like that change.
<Aurora> but that requires playing the story again
<CCCP> well by everypony, you wont be seeing me much any more :(
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<Kosoveon|Writing> a virus wouldn't be very competent if it couldn't hide itself somehow
<TheMaster> i'm just saying. If they wanted to make a doctor who spin off of my little pony, I would hand them more money thant hey could know what to do with
<Aurora> I'd like to stick with one save file right now
<flutter_spin> Even DHN tends to say "looks like EQD got it wrong. We have proof..."
<Ryanier128> Derpy_Hooves88 run now. Get youself and any sanity you have left out of here right now
<Kid_Cobalt> Derpy_Hooves88: nothing out of the ordinary....trixy stripping....ya da ya da
<Sumica> 00,10Hasbro is not gonna let go of it. they wont shoot for sindecation
<HyperMetalLugia> Nightseas
<TheMaster> I would personally fly David Tennant to canada/US to supply the voice
<BlueFlare> 02Exactly
<Ponies47> DeathStar: The guy who was reading the fanfic started screaming after he finshed reading it.
<Ryanier128> Derpy_Hooves88 do it before it's too late
<drfsupercenter> 03well if a virus doesn't *do* anything, then what's the point LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't had a single BSOD either
<Derpy_Hooves88> trixie stripping? oh ok, thats normal
<HyperMetalLugia> And exactly DRF
<DeathStar> Ponies47: oh that's not good
<TheMaster> she's not stripping. she's clothing
<Derpy_Hooves88> at least its not derpy
<Derpy_Hooves88> i have mad respect for her
<HyperMetalLugia> If the 'virus' does nothing
<TheMaster> in equestria putting clothes on is what's kinky
<Ponies47> DeathStar: IKR
<HyperMetalLugia> and Mbam doesn't pick anything up
<Ryanier128> or Rainbow Dash
<flutter_spin> wait what Ponies47 ? What?
<Aurora> dunno, Monk is fast and I love playing as fast characters, wizard has a lot of fun skills, witch doctor as well
<Sumica> 00,10also sindication is best if you are aiming for more then 65 eps, not stoping at it
<TheMaster> the more clothes the kinkier
<Ryanier128> oh fuck
<Kid_Cobalt> Derpy_Hooves88: now that would be interesting.....
<BlueFlare> 02drf, they slow your computer down and *can* steal your info?
<HyperMetalLugia> Then there is nothing bad on here
<Gunthler> Derpy Derpy Derpy Derpy
<Ingwaz> Sumica: that would certainly be the most logical thing to do, i agree, but recently companies have shown me they don't always follow what i consider to be very clear logic. honestly, i'd like mlp to go on for as longa s possible
<Rain> guys.. Studio B is a sub section of DHX. Top Draw's client is DHX. Therefore DHX hired Top Draw to help with 13 eps.
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord for some reason decided to DC me, reconnecting
<drfsupercenter> 03well there you go, if your computer doesn't randomly slow down...
<Gunthler> Derpy Derpy Derpy
<WallDives> Kid_Cobalt: I couldnt look at it. would feel wrong, wrong personality.
<LadyCanary> ...What language is this song in? o_o
<Mutterguy> Wrex is still working?
<Sumica> 00,10think of 65 eps as the soft cap not the hard cap
<HyperMetalLugia> Most viruses are fake antivirus programs now
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had Malwarebytes on here (in active mode, too) for the past couple years and the only virus it's detected is the false-positive of bluesun's Dream World hacker
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<TheMaster> As long as they have a big budget and arn't morons (the biggest issue) they won't kill the goose that laid the golden egg
<Golakka> Just saying, I hope they let MLP:FIM go when its still good, Not drag out 100 episodes, steadily getting crap
<HyperMetalLugia> Pretty obvious when you get them.
<flutter_spin> What I liked about the last episode: http://derpy.me/vZuuB
<drfsupercenter> 03those things are such a pain
<LadyCanary> For some reason it sounds like Hebrew. derp.
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly, Ad Muncher is the way to go
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: I was listening to a fanfic reading. I twas so nasty. Infact it was so nasty the guy who was reading started screaming after he finshed
<Ingwaz> Rain: the problem is we have no proof if its they need help doing 13 eps while dhx does the other 13, or if top draw is doing the only 13 eps
<drfsupercenter> 03since there's really only two ways you get viruses
<TheMaster> we'll know when FIM has jumped the shark when they...make a movie
<Golakka> I think its sweedish
<drfsupercenter> 031. Be a complete idiot and download files without even thinking
<LadyCanary> Huh.
<Kid_Cobalt> WallDives: oh shut up and do it are you a foal or a colt!
<Pinkies4thWall> OHAI
<LadyCanary> Probably is, Golakka
<Sumica> 00,10dat rideing crop
<TheMaster> a tv show getting a movie is the death call..is that a whip?
<drfsupercenter> 032. Accidentally click on ads that look like they have an "X" button but really don't
<flutter_spin> LOL. Oh man.
<WallDives> Kid_Cobalt: I dont draw.
<TheMaster> riding crop
<drfsupercenter> 03Block the ads, eliminate #2
<LadyCanary> ....
<drfsupercenter> 03and as for 1, nothing can help you but maybe solitary confinement? :P
<Wrek> 05actually i wouldnt be suprised if its hebrew
<LadyCanary> IT IS IN HEBREW.
<Rain> Ingwaz, problem is that you have no proof that they arent just getting help. Everyone is likely over reacting'
<Ryanier128> Lyra's one of my favorite Background Ponies
<flutter_spin> screaming AFTER finishing is a bad sign
<LadyCanary> OH SHEET.
<panda|Burgers> Oh, im back and thats a lovely drawing Wrek :D
<Ingwaz> Golakka: a show doesnt have to go bad after 100 eps
<BlueFlare> 02those are just the main ways you can get one
<Kid_Cobalt> WallDives: ohhhhh.....I thought you were talking about watching wrek draw derpy stripping....
<Ryanier128> Her name's fun to say. "Lyra" . . .
<TheMaster> I didn't know israel had techno bands
<Ryanier128> I'm drunk
<Cobellanez> I'd be happy if I could just outline a pony
<LadyCanary> Col hazman. THAT'S IN FREAKING HEBREW.
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: eeyup
<LadyCanary> And Im understanding a bit of the song @_@
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Rain> :3
<WallDives> Kid_Cobalt: I'm saying that would be something I couldnt look at.
<flutter_spin> Is it me, or has this chat grown over the weeks?
<Golakka> I know Ingwaz, Generally shows start to get crappy the longer they go on
<WallDives> LadyCanary: you understand hebrew?
<Sumica> 00,10TheMaster, infected mushroom
<TheMaster> once a tv show gets a movie then all is lost. its way to much money, executive meddling and they bring in new movie people and the show is never the same again.
<drfsupercenter> 03if you use a web-based email like Yahoo, you won't get the viruses from opening files unless you actually download them
<drfsupercenter> 03I rest my case :P
<Ingwaz> Rain: that part is not a problem, i don't require proof that theyre not getting help, i require proof that they are
<TheMaster> simpsons, spongebob...every time
<Wrek> 05currently listenign to infected mushrooms latest album released quite recently
<Kid_Cobalt> WallDives: oh in that case...shut up and do it are you a foal or a colt!
<Ryanier128> LadyCanary I'm still working out the lyrics to "Ballad of the Goddes"
<Wrek> 05havent heard it before so listenign through all songs
<Golakka> I hope they lay MLP:FIM To rest at a good time, Before it has a chance to rot and decay
<flutter_spin> Hey now. If "Q" wants to do a doc on bronies, not all is lost
<Ingwaz> Golakka: generally shows dont do this well and have such creative talents behind them
<Rain> Ingwaz you are just paranoid :p
<Sumica> 00,10i like it wrek
<Ingwaz> Rain: only the paranoid survive
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis: I didn't vote-kick.
<WallDives> Kid_Cobalt: I have my reasons, quiet child.
<TheMaster> a documentary isn't the same as a animated movie.
<LadyCanary> WallDives: I was in a Hebrew school for 8 years. I can read it and write it, but cant understand certain parts.
<Sumica> 00,10then again i have always liked there tracks
<Ingwaz> Wrek: i would not mind being that pole
<TheMaster> Heh, a live action my little pony movie.
<TheMaster> that would be hilariously awful
<Ponies47> TheMaster: Perfect example Spongebob
<DerpStar> Hey everypony
<WallDives> LadyCanary: interesting.
<panda|Burgers> Wrek, infected mushroom? arent they the spanish band who did "I'm going insane" ?
<WallDives> ohai DerpStar.
<Ingwaz> TheMaster: NO
<Kid_Cobalt> WallDives: Kid! the term to use is quiet "KID"
<Wrek> 05israelic and yes
<Golakka> MLP:FIm live show is terror
<TheMaster> directed my M. Night Shamylan
<Ryanier128> oh dear Ingwaz
<DerpStar> I see we have a trixie in the works
<Kandarihu> Anyway, I figure Twilight Sparkle's male escort would be Spike. Applejack's escort would be Big Macintosh. Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash have nobody other than their pets as longshots for male escorts. And Rarity? How about one of the diamond dogs?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-ideally-this-would-happen-with-more-parents2.jpg
<BlueFlare> 02either way, it's just smarter to have some sort of anti-virus on your PC
<TheMaster> the twist is. IT WAS EARTH ALL ALONG
<Kosoveon|Writing> ^
<panda|Burgers> Wrek israili? they sounds spanish ^^
<Sumica> 00,10i have a awsome 5 hour track from this group
<Golakka> Also spike
<drfsupercenter> 03right, but it's not smarter to PAY for said anti-virus
<Ingwaz> Ryanier128: what?
<drfsupercenter> 03just get Malwarebytes
<flutter_spin> She reminds me of something. I can't figure it out. .. ... something magical.. ...
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly
<TheMaster> male escorts? what?
<Gunthler> DeathStar: :3
<Kid_Cobalt> WallDives: ya' darn teenagers with ya' rockin rollin music and your 8 track tapes........
<flutter_spin> its going to drive me crazy
<Golakka> Spike has one in each arm :p0
<panda|Burgers> WAIT! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PONY?
*WallDives sighs
<Aircrafter> Well Hi Everyp- OH GOD WHAT IS THIS NO!?!?!?
<BlueFlare> 02some people just want to be extra safe
<drfsupercenter> 03most of the brand name ones are terrible, because anybody who knows anything about making viruses can just program around those
<Gunthler> DeathStar: Dances :d
<flutter_spin> lol welcome Aircrafter
<Mutterguy> It's Nauuuuuuuuughty
<Ponies47> I CAN'T SPEAK SPANISH! (nor do I want to)
<Ryanier128> Ingwaz why would you want to be a pole? . . . oh, I get it now. Stupid drunk brain
<DerpStar> Is that Spike in the background?
<Ingwaz> Aircrafter: you know you like it
<Wrek> 05anotehr one added to the chock counter
<Ingwaz> Ryanier128: ....
<TheMaster> also seth is in the audience, covertly
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi Aircrafter
<Aircrafter> Ingwaz: ...Shut up <_<
<LadyCanary> Ohai Aircrafter
<Wrek> 05what spanish Ponies47?
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why Norton and McAfee suck, because they've been around for so long it's child's play to disable those and make your stuff not detected
<Kandarihu> So this IS Infected Mushroom?
<Ryanier128> Ingwaz I told you I was drunk
<Wrek> 05still hebrew i think
<TheMaster> This is hebrew
<Aircrafter> Hi sumica, flutter_spin, CanaryL- I mean, LadyCanary.
<LadyCanary> It is, Wrek.
<Golakka> When seth sees this, Concequences will never be the same again
<Ingwaz> Ryanier128: no excuse
<Gunthler> DeathStar:
<flutter_spin> its that hat. That hat looks just like the little tihing in my memory
<Mutterguy> a good name for a band it seems
<Sumica> 00,10wrek is having so much fun with this drawing between chat reactions and just geting to draw
<panda|Burgers> ANYPONY WANT PAINT TOOL SAI? xD
<BlueFlare> 02Kaspersky free trial has been pretty good
<Ryanier128> stfu Ingwaz we've been through this before
<TheMaster> Does EQD make money at all? I remember reading that Seth spends most of his time managing the site
<LadyCanary> I would love to know who composed that last song, Wrek. I liked it!
<Aircrafter> Lol Epic Phwoto :3
<Ingwaz> while trixie certainly does make a good "showmare", i think pinkie could give her a good run ;)
<Aircrafter> O_O WAIT! WAIT! Thats Tr-....Oh god. Fav Pony forever ruined.
<Sumica> 00,10should have seen it earlyer Aircrafter. The pole was originaly Meanwhile
<DerpStar> GaP Trixie Pony is Best Pony
<flutter_spin> I was thinking http://ponykillerx.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4qzgf9 but... no can't be
<drfsupercenter> 03why, did you go download viruses to test?
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<panda|Burgers> Aircrafter: trixie is your fav?
<Ryanier128> fucking bitch is sitting like a human!
<Ponies47> Wrek: IDK?
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<NickleBack> :D
<Ryanier128> ONLY LYRA SITS LIKE A HUMAN!
<drfsupercenter> 03because seriously
<WallDives> Aircrafter: but that picture made her a ordinary pony to one of my favorites.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only time you can really tell if an antivirus is worth its weight in salt
<Ingwaz> TheMaster: i imagine they get some money from advertisements, its also probably funded through other means
<drfsupercenter> 03is when you actually NEED it
<WallDives> IMO.
<drfsupercenter> 03so go infect yourself with something and then we'll see who's talking
*drfsupercenter runs
<XAX> Afternoon.
<BlueFlare> 02well yeah
<TheMaster> The brony mafia probably keeps it going.
<Ryanier128> hi XAX

<XAX> Mutterguy: i wasnt going to, but you had to say that.
<SunderlandPony89> XAX: I hope your body is ready for some RULE 34
*Gunthler|ZzZ falls asleep
<Mutterguy> yes
<WallDives> there's another.
<Kosoveon|Writing> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon|Writing, you are a 4Nidoqueen.

<Kosoveon|Writing> BlueFlare
<Sumica> 00,10this is not r34
<flutter_spin> UGH! Where have I seen that hat?

<Kosoveon|Writing> do you use Microsoft Security Essentials?
<GabeMoist> Oooh mai
<BlueFlare> 02nope
<SunderlandPony89> Sumica: It's a form of Rule34. And I'm not calling it crap if that's what you're thinking
*Gunthler|ZzZ zzzzzz
<Kosoveon|Writing> that works good for me
<Renard> Good night!
<Golakka> Rule34 is a statement! Not a description!
<Kosoveon|Writing> as does Norton and Malwarebytes
<WallDives> she can put on her robe and wizard hat all day, man.
<Ponies47> LAUGHS LIKE A NUTJOB!
<Rain> you imature people and your inability to watch Wrek create art without freaking out about where he is coloring.
<Aircrafter> panda|Burgers: One of my favs, not my fav fav...or waifu. or somethin'.
<TheMaster> So, if you had to pick one thing you could see in season 3 what would it be?
<Sumica> 00,10did't know we had sub clauses to r34 now
<drfsupercenter> 03please tell me you don't actually have 3 antiviruses going at once
<panda|Burgers> you know, Wrek is awesome! does he have a DA account?
<flutter_spin> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-propose-a-new-rule/
<Wrek> 05ok seriously

<Kosoveon|Writing> no thanks
*Mutterguy had the old stream window with the embarassed meanwhile in it... Derp
<Ingwaz> this might be good club/dancing music...just really not my thing it seems
<Sumica> 00,10brb, swaping sound to the suroundsound
<panda|Burgers> Sumica, guess what ^^
<TheMaster> even if it was a single sentence. I want to see David Tennant voice a pony. specifically the brown one that looks kinda, sorta like him.
<TheMaster> My life would be complete forever
<BlueFlare> 02might look into Microsoft Security Essentials after this trial ends
<Aircrafter> So uh...Why is Spike in the background?
<Sumica> 00,10panda|Burgers, chicken butt?
<Ponies47> I've got the stream muted. I'm playing music I like :P
<HyperMetalLugia> The only thing that irritates me about mbam premium
<TheMaster> because spike opened up the pony 'dress' club.
<HyperMetalLugia> Is the stupid website blocker
<Ryanier128> Aircrafter this is the Bachelor Party
<DerpStar> Aircrafter: Spike jasa thing for Unicorns
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Aircrafter> I see....
<Kandarihu> flutter_spin: That will be a challenge to enforce, but it can be done.
<drfsupercenter> 03I disabled that.
<Ryanier128> I need another beer
<Rain> so, Wrek, its 5:43am where you are. Did you recently wake up or are you just doing an all nighter?

<drfsupercenter> 03because it contains some code that communicates with the Internet
<Sumica> 00,10I still want to do a mexican/italian fusion restraunt. I will call it Que-pasta
<HyperMetalLugia> "Dw vblah blah appears malicious!"

<TheMaster> now go and hide that in a archeological dig Midnight_Fyre
<Aircrafter> DerpStar: This is child's play comparing to the things I've seen
<Ryanier128> Sumica that was a bad joke. I'm drunk and I didn't find that funny
<Midnight_Fyre> Golakka: Yes, plaster
<drfsupercenter> 03but antiviruses are like "Oh no, this thing can send data to websites, it must be stopped"
<WallDives> Aircrafter: exactly...
<TheMaster> so that we can learn about the ancient aliens who watched MLP because aliens
<BlueFlare> 02okay, Kaspersky blocked it
<HyperMetalLugia> at least chrome's built in malware blocker 'works'
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<drfsupercenter> 03because that isn't malware
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<DerpStar> Well I'm glad I'm a woman I don't have to understand cloppers

<phobos2390> Ryanier: I hate it too
<Ryanier128> DerpStar I was thinking of a different clop
<Rain> DerpStar, Im pretty sure I do.
<drfsupercenter> 03what pisses me off to no end is McAfee
<Aircrafter> Midnight_Fyre: Saw your carving, immediately thought "EGYPTIAN RUINS ;D!"

<LunaTheMaid> SD
<LunaTheMaid> *XD
<WallDives> the two are unrelated, there could be some overlap.
<Ponies47> Dear Princess Celastia today I learned there's good fanfic's bad fanfic's and then there's Paddycakes.
<junh1024-XD> and there's no option to change it?
<Golakka> 82% of people will automatically belive your argument if you quote a false but realistic statistic
<NickleBack> She's bring sexy back :D
<drfsupercenter> 03as we had students at the camp I worked at make computer games that got flagged by McAfee and NOTHING ELSE
<drfsupercenter> 03Then they're like
<Spoon_Ghost> pornies......
<phobos2390> WallDives: Yeah, probably not.
<drfsupercenter> 03My entire project got deleted
<WallDives> that is, some of the 75% are also some of the 25%.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm like
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<RyanierIsDrunk> this should make things simpler
<Golakka> thats not a false stastistic mind you
<drfsupercenter> 03<_<
<Midnight_Fyre> Aircrafter: Why did that not cross my mind at all while making it? Now I won't be able to stop
<Sumica> 00,10I would not go to a strip club. Why would I want to get all reved up just to be frustrated.
<drfsupercenter> 03Camp's fault for using crappy antivirus
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD, you need admin rights
<MahBoi777> ha
<panda> strip clubs are friggin boring... they just make you pop one and you cant do anything
<junh1024-XD> oh
<Aircrafter> Midnight_Fyre: What have I done ;w;
<drfsupercenter> 03and university computers, we didn't have admin rights
<drfsupercenter> 03so it just delets the files
<drfsupercenter> 03and won't let you get them back
<WallDives> I've been to a few strip clubs. most of them was because liquor was paid for.
<drfsupercenter> 03at least malwarebytes ASKS you
<drfsupercenter> 03quarantine or ignore
<DerpStar> It's interesting, usually I'm the desginted driver for the gents in my group of buddies
<Midnight_Fyre> Sumica: Really, who would want to pay to be teased?
<Spoon_Ghost> weird....
<DerpStar> designated'
<Ingwaz> Sumica: lol, yeah, i never really understood why go to a strip club. they just make you really want to do something inappropriate in public, and thats generally frowned upon
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, I want to try something though
<Meat-eater_Modeabel> DO NOT WANT.
<BlueFlare> 02http://i1181.photobucket.com/albums/x429/GreatLugia/untitled-7.jpg <-- that's what I got drf
<Sumica> 00,10I do like being the desagnated driver for party like that though
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Malwarebytes shows it as Backdoor Agent
<Reikim> Sumica: Why so?
<Sumica> 00,10friends get so drunk I can stop and have them pay for gas 3 times on the way home
<Aircrafter> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03really all that means is "this program COULD be used to do harmful stuff"
<HyperMetalLugia> same
<junh1024-XD> dw.exe?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Ingwaz> Sumica: thats brilliant
<phobos2390> Sumica: nice.
<RyanierIsDrunk> Sumica last time I was a designated driver I ended up drinking anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03but all it does is communicate with pokemon-gl
<Aircrafter> Sumica: YOU ARE A CHAMPION MY FRIEND!
<panda> Sumica: XD well.. i usually record my friends and what they say and play it back to them later ^^

<MahBoi777> lol
<phobos2390> Sumica: reminds me of a foxtrot cartoon
<drfsupercenter> 03theoretically yes, you could use the same coding to attack websites
<drfsupercenter> 03but dw.exe doesn't
<Reikim> Oh, Sumica...I salute your practicality.
<Ingwaz> RyanierIsDrunk: they have a place for you, its called AA
<NickleBack> Dat Detail
<Ingwaz> Midnight_Fyre: did you make that?

<phobos2390> Oh! I also seem to have cleared up most of the bugs surrounding my collision detection program.
<Reikim> Aircrafter: If you should be scared of anyone, be scared of Shizuka. She is calm and nice and happy...and a ninja who could easily kill you in your sleep. While she, too, is sleeping.
<Roara|Diablo> well
<RyanierIsDrunk> Ingwaz a Newfie is somebody who lives in NEwfoundland. They're the "Party Hard Drink Harder" kind of guys
<Reikim> Were you really kicked?
<WallDives> RyanierIsDrunk: I dont drink alone, thats sad, and I cry. No, I go with a group, and we travel.And play games. And yell, get drunk, and other fun.
<FlareChaser> Aircrafter: first, my girlfriend yells at me for no god damn reason, then I failed my god damn test, then I cant play L4D2, THEN I CANT TALK, THINK OR SUGGEST MY SHIPPING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK IM OVERDOING IT, then I fucking. Cant. handle it.

<SunderlandPony89> Cya guys, I gotta head out to sleep
<Reikim> inb4 Sumica puts ideaa in everypony's minds again.
<WallDives> later SunderlandPony89.
<Meat-eater_Modeabel> lol at spike
<phobos2390> Reikim: Huh? I never mentioned the light speed barrier. 10,000 times the speed of sound is nowhere nere the speed of light.
<Midnight_Fyre> later SunderlandPony89
<MahBoi777> gnight SunderlandPony89! sleep well
<YamaTHou> cya SunderlandPony89
<Kid_Cobalt> YamaTHou: no he is using a special pad.
<Sumica> 00,10oh, did some one need help down in to the gutter Reikim?
<Reikim> phobos2390: I mean with space battles.
<YamaTHou> oow....that explains a lot
<SunderlandPony89> Night! :)
<Reikim> Sumica, I am so far past the gutter right now that I think it counts as spelunking.
<panda> Sumica: I'd like for you to help me out !!
<phobos2390> Reikim: Why would they be concerned about the speed of light in space battles?
<Stallion_of_War> Reikim: lol, spelunking...
<phobos2390> Reikim: Never mind stupid queston
<Reikim> phobos2390: Depending on weapons range...yeah.
<Sumica> 00,10that word sounds dirty
*Rain saw her name on that list :3
<Shizuka> 13it's a cute jab "you'll be letting your team down"... i let my team down four maps ago don't know why the game didn't offer to just kick me
<Reikim> Spelunking...is exploring caves...nothing else...
<Sumica> 00,10lol weapons range. in space
<Midnight_Fyre> Well, I'm off to bed. See youz
<phobos2390> Reikim: I have decided that most of the killing will be done at a distance. It is space after all.
<Stallion_of_War> lol, caves
<Reikim> Sumica: Exactly. If they're not energy weapons, they have theoretically infinite range.
<DaringDude> Reikem u ther
<Stallion_of_War> Pony war?
<DaringDude> Reikim: wanna join our xbox party nd just tawk?
<phobos2390> Reikim: Radar, Binoculars, Timed Charges, and Nukes.
<Stallion_of_War> PONY WAR???
<Wrek> 05speaking of space
<Sumica> 00,10ever see the speach in Mass effect 2 Reikim?
<Reikim> phobos2390: At a certain distance, by the time the light gets to you...your target will have moved. And mass-based projectiles have theoretically infinite range.
<CupcakeWarrior> SPAAAAAAAACE
<MahBoi777> I like space
<Kandarihu> Did I just hear Goofy's laugh sampled into that?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I set /gompShizu to on, prevents any Shizukas from leaving the game
<Reikim> Sumica: SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS THE DEADLIEST SONUVABITCH IN SPACE so yeah.
<MahBoi777> wanna go to space space space
<Shizuka> 13just drags it out
<Sumica> 00,10eyup
<panda> MahBoi777: no you dont
<phobos2390> Reikim: Like a nuclear weapon? of course.
<Shizuka> 13we lost from the first five minutes of both games
<Wrek> 05dead spaec ponies ftw
*Rain hugs Shizuka
<Rain> ikr, Wrek?
<MahBoi777> panda: yup yup, wanna go to space
<Stallion_of_War> Hand lightning is best energy weapon
<phobos2390> Reikim: A space war would be ridiculously complicated.
<Reikim> DaringDude: Sorry, I ahve to sleep soon...
<Kid_Cobalt> Because alive space wasnt good enough.
<panda> MahBoi777: but, you'll get bored of space
<DaringDude> okeee
<Ponies47> GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!
<Wrek> 05+10 for reference

<Stallion_of_War> http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081209230704/avatar/images/3/3b/Azula_fires_Lightning.png
<MahBoi777> gnight Ponies47!
<phobos2390> Reikim: Like sniper warfare.
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont get the reference D:
<Reikim> phobos2390: Until they got close enough to a planet, anyway.
<phobos2390> Reikim: what?
<MahBoi777> hmmmmmm
<Spectrum_Rush> star trek
<Stallion_of_War> Did anypony else think Sunny Smiles from Fallout was hot?
<Reikim> phobos2390: Things get complicated around planets. Especially if the invading force wants the planet's resources.
<Shizuka> 13it's just not fun to play a game for twenty minutes when you only actually get to interact for thirty seconds
<Stallion_of_War> lol that cardassian
<Reikim> Shizuka: You mean like any arena-style mode in TF2?
<Shizuka> 13and then get to sit and watch everyone else be that much better than you
<phobos2390> Reikim: Yup. Planets are huge. Gravity comes in to play. Orbits come into play.
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka - Are you talking about L4D2?
<Reikim> phobos2390: But also a desire to NOT just nuke everything to death.
<Shizuka> 13that was my worst session yet
<Kosoveon|Writing> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon|Writing, you are a 6Mew.
<Sumica> 00,10one book I read had and intersting play out on how space combat worked.
<phobos2390> Reikim: The distances and scale of an actual space war would be enormous.
<Spectrum_Rush> there... are... four lights :[
<Meat-eater_Modeabel> ITs twiley cyrus
<Reikim> phobos2390: If you want to, say, colonize the planet and perhaps terraforming it, you don't want to nuke it. Which you could do, but which would irradiate it.
<phobos2390> Reikim: I guess so.
<Sumica> 00,10I see wrek is checking on his empire
<Tassadork> oh man, I made an ogame account once
<Stallion_of_War> phobos2390: disreguard distance, aquire death start
<Stallion_of_War> *...
<Tassadork> I wonder how dead my little planet is now
<Stallion_of_War> STAR, DEATH STAR
<Kandarihu> Well, orbit is actually a perfect balance between velocity and gravity. I think that's how it works.
<Golakka> Wrek, What uni? :p
<Reikim> phobos2390: Thus, you'd have to engage the defense fleet /very/ carefully, to avoid hitting the planet
<DaringDude> Pinkies4thWall: invite me t partry
<kenne> hey DaringDude how comes oyur not talking or anything
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<WallDives> if I knew FPSs better, I could offer advice, but I know what you mean, Shizu...
<DaringDude> apparently i keep laggin out
<Reikim> phobos2390: Then you'd have to somehow land ground troops and take any points of interest.
<DaringDude> join Pinkies4thWall party
<phobos2390> Reikim: Very very very very very carefully.
<kenne> DaringDude: lame, where did inglorious go?
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka - Free for alls are better, you get the chance to pick off weak targets and then respawn
<Glacymr> oh
<DaringDude> idk
<Stallion_of_War> Because I have no multiplayer fps skills :D
<Stallion_of_War> Unless COUNTER STRIKE
<Reikim> Shizuka: The problem here...is that you die. And you don't respawn. A bit like real life :(
<Pinkies4thWall> Brony party on XBL @ my place!
<Kandarihu> What game are you talking about, Shizuka? Left 4 Dead 2?
<Kid_Cobalt> Stallion_of_War: im so tired of that game. every freakin time it never fails. just as were on the last stretch someone falls and needs help my team mates all turn to pusses on me so I go it alone with nothing but a magnum and an axe. Lo' and behold as soon as I help that person up I get mauled by a tank or a charger and they leave me to die.....OR whats even better we will be truding along and I say that there is a witch nearb
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: not as humans, as infected
<phobos2390> Reikim: yeah, but landing the ground troops would be fairly easy if you had disposable space craft that could go into the upper atmosphere and let the soldiers skydive.
<Shizuka> 13first round, i lived a total of 17 seconds
<Shizuka> 13out of five minutes
<CupcakeWarrior> dat wall
<Golakka> 10 light fighters! Holy shit! we have a badass in here!
<MahBoi777> ow mah head
<Reikim> phobos2390: Without getting shot down?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: what's wrong with you?
<Cobellanez> Good job Shizuka !
<Reikim> Shizuka: That's still better than me!
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: L4D?
<Shizuka> 13yes
<phobos2390> Reikim: How do you shoot down a person when you are several hundred miles from where you are?
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka: You should play vs with someone who equally sucks as infected (<---)
*mario_pony hugs phobos2390
*Reikim realizes it's late
<phobos2390> hi mario_pony
<Stallion_of_War> I feel like playing Happy Wheels
<Wrek> 05how
<somepony_else> hi mario_pony
<Wrek> 05the sun is in full galore outside
*phobos2390 hugs mario_pony
<Cobellanez> Full GALOOOORREEE
<Sumica> 00,10I know that feel wrek
<Golakka> Good boy, back to work :p
<Darkts3> WHOA
<Golakka> your fleet can wait
<Reikim> phobos2390: Defense fleet shoots down anything that gets remotely close. Detection is really, really easy in space (thermal emissions and all that). And in order to even HAVE space travel, you need super-complex computers. Not that we don't already have anti-missile missiles.
<Stallion_of_War> IF THE PSYCHIC ISN'T SECRETLY TIMELORD THEY'RE FULL OF PONY FODDER...
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: really cause ms. moons is beaming something fierce over here..
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek's empire is so much further along then mine
<Golakka> ALARM!
<Golakka> What uni are you guys in?
<Viri> 14!Glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Viri for 16 minutes and has to fly Viri around until then
<Glacymr> noo
<Wrek> 05mizar
<Golakka> Better be Mizar, so i can
<Viri> 14:D
<Viri> 14your first order: go to school instead of me
<Viri> 14x3
<Reikim> Hm, what game is this?
<Wrek> 05apply for NLR
<Golakka> ooh, just started earlier tonight
<Golakka> 2-94-10
<phobos2390> Reikim: but it would still be ridiculously complicated to find them and shoot them down.
<Reikim> This music is fitting for saucy Trixie.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Sumica> 00,10I am just geting metal 15
<Golakka> Sent the app wrek
<Stallion_of_War> Why... why is there no Saucy Luna...
<Glacymr> dragon's don't go to school
<Golakka> im working on metal 4 right now :P
<CupcakeWarrior> What game is that?
<Stallion_of_War> there's NEVER any saucy luna
<Stallion_of_War> :(
<Golakka> www.ogame.org cupcake
<Viri> 14not in italy .w.
<CupcakeWarrior> This is a browser based game?
<Golakka> aye
<Reikim> phobos2390: Not really. Again, detection is really easy in space. Battles are fought long-range. And it's actually more obvious than you think to notice something falling from the sky if you have planet-wide radar coverage (or similar).
<Golakka> F2P, microtrans heavy
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what?
<drfsupercenter> 03also dragons don't exist
<drfsupercenter> 03your move
*drfsupercenter runs
<Golakka> microtrans only makes things "easier", you cant get any shit a F2Per cant
<Reikim> Stallion_of_War: I can fix that, but then Sumica will accuse me of gutter-membership again.
<Sumica> 00,10damn, cruisers already wrek?
<Chrysalis> man those teams were SO unbalanced
<junh1024-XD> >komodo dragon
<Wrek> 055 of them
<Sumica> 00,10slick
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis you think ?
<Golakka> That feel when you build your first battleship
<Chrysalis> klnow
<Sumica> 00,10and that's not a bad thing Reikim =p
<Stallion_of_War> Luna is even more awesome because she uses lightning :)
<Golakka> then you realise the guy next to you has 2,000 of them
*Stallion_of_War dat lightning
<CupcakeWarrior> Is that one of those games that you need to play often?
<Sumica> 00,10check it once or twice a day CupcakeWarrior
<Golakka> Not really cupcake
<phobos2390> Reikim: So it would be really easy to shoot them down? So if anyone was trying to skydive into some remote part of africa we would be able to shoot them down from america?
<Glacymr> o-O
<Golakka> Early on, No, you can go away for days
<Glacymr> yes junh1024-XD
<Glacymr> komodo dragons
<Golakka> late on, check every hour, ifnot more
<Reikim> phobos2390: Now that's just a bit unfair. Of course Africa will ahve its own missiles.
<Stallion_of_War> phobos2390: Install DEATH STAR
<Wrek> 05some dude is aboot to attack me
<Wrek> 05he's roast
<Sumica> 00,10all dem fleets dispatches you got wrek
<Golakka> Whats he got, and what do you have?
<Reikim> Stallion_of_War: Now that I have Sumica's blessing, I can give you this: http://derpy.me/xXnsN
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Ahahaha
<FlareChaser|L4D2> nice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Horrific final match.
<Wrek> 05large cargo and 1 recycler vs 5 cruisersr and several fighters
<FlareChaser> Eyup
<Chrysalis> thanks for the games guys, hopefully the random number gods are nicer next time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ended it early.
<Golakka> ha!
<CupcakeWarrior> Reikim: O//O
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: tis was bad.
<phobos2390> Reikim: Also, wouldn't thermal tracking be harder when the paratroopers are skydiving in the atmosphere?
<Stallion_of_War> That doesn't ACTUALLY look as much like Luna as others...
<junh1024-XD> pwnt
<Golakka> Destroyed in the first round!
<Stallion_of_War> :(
<Reikim> phobos2390: That's where radar comes into play.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, our damn team rushed and left me behind when they could have saved me.
<Sumica> 00,10that's not an attack fleet wrek, that trash pickup
<Reikim> phobos2390: Also the atmosphere is damn cold.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was downhill from there.
<Shizuka> 13i was going back for you
<Golakka> Got recyclers yet?
<Shizuka> 13but was armed with a worthless weapons
<Wrek> 05and ima gona obliterate it
<Shizuka> 13and was boomed
<Shizuka> 13and swarmed

<Reikim> And now that I've shared saucy Luna pics, I think I'll have to go to bed in order to forget the experience. Night, everypony.
<Golakka> Where the fuck is he comming from!?
<Stallion_of_War> now THAT'S saucy
<Sumica> 00,1036hours, damn his fleet is slow

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doesn't help that I'm being ignored.
<Biglaw> FlareChaser eeehhh, naybe
<phobos2390> Reikim: I guess the attackers will just have to launch a massive attack like the one on D-Day and hope for the best.
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: NOW :|
<Reikim> Now GOOD NIGHT everypony! Quick, before I get distracted by saucy pics again...
<panda> Nittany_Discord, I glomped you :/

<FlareChaser> Biglaw: one sec... :|

<phobos2390> Reikim: I was thinking about the second space war having the invasion of mars be a bit like that. Enough troops would land and then most of the battling would be on foot.
<Bluestrom_S> good night everyone

<Mozdoc> I find myself thinking I'm fitting to the personality of Twilight. Need to analyze and predict and plot everything.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only one I see, then, is that demo-mode 3.30
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's all scratched up on the outside, which is like :|
<CupcakeWarrior> Hehe, plot

<TheRandomkid321> I hate microsoft (on an apple) but I must say id prefere xbox than playstation... I do not wish to start a war
<Chrysalis> not really, the CPU is aging a fair bit
<Chrysalis> its only a c2quad
<Ninjazz> I'm more of a PS3 gamer but I agree PC is the best system to play on. It's almost obvious.
<CupcakeWarrior> Console gaming is way better than PC gaming imo
<MahBoi777> I like xbox too TheRandomkid321
<Glacymr> Kosoveon is tuff
<Glacymr> like a wiggly
<Glacymr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Glacymr, you are a 12Togetic.
<Shane377> TheRandomkid321: u hate microsoft and yet u like xbox360 <-- ironic much
<Chrysalis> CupcakeWarrior on what grounds?
<Glacymr> i'll stick with mewtwo
<Polydunami> I don't care about the platforms themselves, so long as I get some good gaming material
<panda> Chrysalis: dont have an i7?
<drfsupercenter> 03hm there
<Master_Chief> ps3 games r too expensive\

<drfsupercenter> 03and this is an awesome live recording xD
<Shane377> Master_Chief: o hai Mastur Chi3f
<TheRandomkid321> Im fine with people saying PC is better than xbxo. It is factual. It has more RAM and MODS but I hate PC gamers who hate us console gamers for no reason D:
<mario_pony> freaking gamestop is a rip-off
<MahBoi777> I don't really care about xbox live, cuz mah internet isn't compatible :P
<Chrysalis> quite an old chip, the GPU is quite new but i do alot of shaders so i need the power
<Shane377> lol MahBoi777
<Ninjazz> Polydunami: I find people's loyalty to blood sucking game publishing companys to be very scary and funny.
<CupcakeWarrior> mario_pony: Gamestop is awesome
<Master_Chief> what is this game?
<Chrysalis> TheRandomkid321 except for people say consoles are better than pc and have NO grounds on it
<Polydunami> Super Robot Wars
<panda> ValtheJean: why no burning finger? :D
<Polydunami> I forget which one
<Polydunami> :S
<MahBoi777> I like how Gamestop won't let u simply leave the store lol
<CupcakeWarrior> Chrysalis: Its just a matter of preference
<TheRandomkid321> Nintendo>Microsoft>Sony. I just dont like the wii
<Midnight_Tempest> Super Robot Wars Z2 i think
<Ninjazz> GameStop has problems.
<CupcakeWarrior> I live gamestop
<CupcakeWarrior> love*
<Kosoveon> of course I am Glacymr
<Kosoveon> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
<Chrysalis> CupcakeWarrior except for playing games it really isnt, the PC is actually BETTER at playing games, better framerates and better looking, smoother controls
<TheRandomkid321> What game store will sell second hand original xbox games?
