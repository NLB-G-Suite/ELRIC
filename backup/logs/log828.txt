<Bronysith> Shizuka: why you being mean?

<KnightLunaire> delicious chekovs soup
<Vordox> Sumica: No reaction to "Hai father?"
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Giants won, but no playoff spot...:(
<Spyrorocks> yeah, thats where they make their money, the toys and licencing.
<Dark_Horst> dafuq is that?
<Everto> In other words, people should charge shows 20 cents rather than $3 on iTunes?
<Sundaysmile> it looks like a 60 vinyl record
<Verdant_Wasp> wtf is that
<Rocket> wut is that ?
<Sundaysmile> happy days
<Bronysith> Verdant_Wasp: second impact
<Spyrorocks> I dont buy from itunes because their prices are stupid.
<Sumica> 00,10that was second impact
<Everto> Exactly
<Vordox> SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME
<Verdant_Wasp> it looks... different
<Spyrorocks> for tv shows and movies.
<Shizuka> 13gendo and fuyutsuki got high up there
<Everto> TV shows and movies are too expensive nowadays
<Vordox> Why did NOTHING happen when "IS that a man on the moon that just said "hi father"...
<Sundaysmile> Vordox - at the heart of it, live the Fonz
<Spyrorocks> I would buy mlp from itunes though if it was availale in canada.
<Vordox> Must me nothing important
<Scarlet_Wings> BLOOD OCEAN
<Stormy> If they made them $1 instead of 3 I'd probably buy a few
<Michael> hi all!
<KnightLunaire> very metal
<Sundaysmile> brutal
<Stormy> I mean, it's 22 minutes
<jcelios> \m/
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Michael
<Scarlet_Wings> I wonder how many drops of blood are in this blood ocean...
<Sumica> 00,10second impact= the start of the end of dasy
<Stormy> $3 is kind of a lot
<Kawaii_icybeauti> and, depressing scene..
<Sumica> 00,10days*
<Everto> $1 for 22 minutes of entertainment
<Everto> Sounds good to me
*Michael hugs AdamTheDuck
<Sundaysmile> sonic rainboom
<KnightLunaire> the end of daisy
<Vordox> <--- Oh a board meetng?
<Everto> More if you rewatch episodes
<Rocket> ah right, why this ocean is filled with blood
<Stormy> yeah
<Dark_Horst> Scarlet_Wings: i suspect you just made a reference /)
<Michael> yay, evangelion
<Sumica> 00,10it's not blood. it's red tide
<ekips> so, if there was a second impact...whah was the first impact?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> someone hold me?
<Everto> I mean, I don't watch MLP, but I love Doctor Who
<Everto> And Sherlock Holmes
<Kawaii_icybeauti> How did the stream go yesterday? I was too exhausted to get up and come to it.
<ekips> what*
<jcelios> ekips: creation of the moon
<Everto> I wish those were cheaper
<Vordox> ekips: When Halo blew up
*AdamTheDuck holds onto aniderp|bestcakeever :<
<Spyrorocks> I dont think they would dare stop the series after s4 though with the momentum they have going.
<Shizuka> 13ekips: the black moon crashing into earth to spin off the moon, it later becomes the geofront and houses lilith
<Everto> And available in the US
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my tummy hurts
<Michael> so, how is everypony doing today? :3
<Sumica> 00,10second impact where 2/3 of all life on earth died
<ekips> that makes sense
<Vordox> Sumica: Thought it was half?
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Half I thought
<Sumica> 00,10could be
<Stormy> Dr. Who is on Netflix
<Vordox> They said half a movie ago.
<Shizuka> 13enough of that, let's have an angel
<Sumica> 00,10ol half
<Verdant_Wasp> does it rly matter if it is 1/2 or 1/3 ?
<jcelios> ye
<Dark92Enigma-> OH YEAH! HERE COMES KOOL AID
<Spyrorocks> mlp is on canadian netlfix
<Vordox> Verdant_Wasp: Yes, plot holes
<Sundaysmile> IT'S A MAGIC 8 BALL!!!
*Kandarihu says grace over his Yakisoba while watching Evangelion.
<Vordox> PLENTY OF THEM
<Stormy> I watched the first episode of one of the series
<Sumica> 00,10either way it's all life not just humans
<Spyrorocks> just got added.
<Everto> I have Netflix
<pot80> I'm too immersed in this to bother commenting anymore
<Shizuka> 13maya is too stressed out
<Verdant_Wasp> Shitload of ppl died, end
<Stormy> Yeah, it's been on ours for a while
<Michael> it's the new movie?
<Everto> But they don't have newer episodes of Doctor Who
<Vordox> Space Angels
<Stormy> only up to S2 though obviously
<Verdant_Wasp> it is
<Sundaysmile> stukkagrenades!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> fdamn, I'm thinking about the abdriged version...
<ekips> 99%? that's not concinving me
<KnightLunaire> wow, the design is even more lazy
<Michael> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> do their bombs and cannons ever have any effect
<Michael> want!
<CriticKitten> Gee what a shock, conventional weapons don't work
<Rocket> CriticKitten exactly
<Sumica> 00,10geomotry is out to fuck you up
<Wrek> 05WHERES THE PILOTS?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: insert anime
<Shizuka> 13KnightLunaire: oh just wait
<Wrek> 05in school sir!
<Everto> Is it so much to ask that I want to watch what I want, when I want, at a reasonable price?
<Wrek> 05DAMMIT!
<Sundaysmile> just think...
<Vordox> lol Wrek
<Stormy> yes
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: we'll try to get them during recess sir!
<KnightLunaire> @Shizuka: goddamnit
<Vordox> That's why I like Cowboy Bebop, Wrek. F'ck teenagers :P
<twilight_sprinkle> geometry is always out to fuck you up
<Michael> this gun b good
<CriticKitten> Deploy every plane
<Sundaysmile> in 15 years Gainax will make a panty and stocking movie remake akin to this ....
<Stormy> because no one has figured out a good system for TV shows
<ekips> WHY are people still living there anyway???
<Stormy> when people are uploading them on youtube all the time anyway
<Spyrorocks> correction
<Vordox> Sundaysmile: Ooooooh
<CriticKitten> Because they're stupid
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: as long as they dont miss lunch or they will be cranky for the rest of the day.
<KnightLunaire> the angel after that is probably a giant boob
<Shizuka> 13you catch it
<Sumica> 00,10cause not many options left in the world as to where you can still live
<Invi> ekips, mayby it's a beautiful place :3
<Spyrorocks> no one has figured out a good system for bringing together and unifying all the different licencing agreements every company wants to make with their coontent.
<Michael> lol
<Spyrorocks> content
<Sundaysmile> you missed that already knightlunaire
<Spyrorocks> itunes is the closest.
<KnightLunaire> damn
<Kawaii_icybeauti> What are the movies for this week?
<pot80> nuke the basterds
<Sundaysmile> not kidding...
<Spyrorocks> for pay per episode/content
<Vordox> Shizuka: 99% to hit, and 99% To fail this mission.. I see a pattern here
<Spyrorocks> netflix for all you can eat streaming.
<Sumica> 00,10Twi would love that place
<Everto> Last time I tried to play a movie from iTunes I got an HDCP error
<Spyrorocks> watch * :P
<Verdant_Wasp> Cthulhu Geometry, killing humans since before time
<Stormy> I would totatlly pay a small amount to watch an official stream of MLP
<Sundaysmile> this will be just like pokemon!
<Stormy> they should do something like that
<Rocket> WHOOOT ?!
<Michael> asuka :3
<Spyrorocks> they put the episode on the hasbro website after airing dont they
<KnightLunaire> look at the graphs! look at it!
<Shizuka> 13never tell me the odds kid
<Vordox> 99% to fail, and all will die
<KnightLunaire> D:
<Dark92Enigma-> Sumica: *Insert TWIGASM after seeing an entire library*
<Stormy> I tried checking there once and couldn't find most of the episodes :(
<Stormy> just preview clips
<Spyrorocks> I have the equipment for broadcasting an HD stream
<broniezrul732> fuck my life
<twilight_sprinkle> asuka is really giving shinji a run for the annoy-o-meter
<Spyrorocks> but mlp isnt on tv in canada except reruns
<Shizuka> 13hopefully in 3 they flesh out where asuka's troubles stem from, since obviously we don't have the mother-committed-doll-suicide angle this time
<KnightLunaire> at least asuka isn't whining
<Vordox> Shizuka: Why is every suit special designed?
<Bronysith> broniezrul732: hi attention whore
<Verdant_Wasp> she is a litlle bitchy
<Buytoast> a little?
<Bronysith> Verdant_Wasp: a little?
<KnightLunaire> mommy complex
<Dark92Enigma-> twilight_sprinkle: funny, i like her more than shiniji
<Verdant_Wasp> yes, grammar nazis
<Sumica> 00,10and shinji still has not caught on
<Spyrorocks> It might get expensive to do if there were a ton of people watching...
<Verdant_Wasp> worse than asuka
<Sundaysmile> shizuka they will never do that except in weird abstract open for interpretation
<RarityDiamondBelle> Hello everypony
<Sundaysmile> that's how gainax works
<Vordox> Sumica: What's MIsato's position in NERVE?
<Arcium> Hi everypony! (Happy New Year! (sooooon))

<Spyrorocks> they use free streaming sites I think
<KnightLunaire> it's a disco ball?! srsly?
<Spyrorocks> and just use a lot of them to split it up so they dont go over the free limit
<AttackWithHugs> I like how these robots just destroy anything they land on and nobody charges them for damages.

<Spyrorocks> if you have a 1gbps line, you can support 333 users
<twilight_sprinkle> and it probably is
<Sumica> 00,10cause shinji was the one to catch the angel
<Everto> Of course you want more than 3mbps if you want it to buffer
<RarityDiamondBelle> yay
<Vordox> Sumica: Aaaand...err....Rei and Asuka?

<twilight_sprinkle> reminds me of nagatos philosophy
<Sumica> 00,10and yes the plug suits are shapd for the pilot it belongs to.
<Barbetos> Shinji must of been made in a test tube, and some one accidently put chemicals in that make him extreme attractive to everyone, and also extremely emo
<Dark_Horst> now what does that tell us about shinjji's built?
<StinkomanFan> No wonder Shinji's got endless pictures of him in a dress

<Vordox> Shizuka: Typical Tsundere. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ffs its just two girls, not nation vs nation
<Buytoast> where did her bandages go
<StinkomanFan> Helga did the Tsundre thing better IMO, just gonna say
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Culture is everyone withinthat continent
<Sundaysmile> she ate them buytoast
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: You're saying the culuture is the same? =P
<KnightLunaire> love is in the air
<ekips> caaan you feeel the love tonight?

<Dark_Horst> warm inside, eh? bet that other guy could help out with that
<Panda> eww
<pot80> "I want him to feel warm inside" I can see where this is going
<Panda> Helatia
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: this isnt culture, there are many different personalities within each nation
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: It's WAAAAAY too stereotpical
<Sundaysmile> dad is too busy fondling robots
<StinkomanFan> Exactly Vordox, so stop overanalyzing
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: True, but culture shapes the people and their opinion
<KnightLunaire> neon genesis hetalia 2 - national boogaloo

<Sumica> 00,10both?
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: No
<Vordox> Sumica: Touche
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: not at all,its only something they see udring their lives, nobody forces them to like or accept it
<StinkomanFan> No to the overanalasis or no to the chesty Berry Punch, Vordox?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Do you kill? Do you eat? What's yur food intake, what's your favourite food, which choice of life do you stand on, what religion/Ideals/political parties/Hierarchy/order do you do?
<KnightLunaire> scoping the situation he is
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: HEtalia :P
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Culture forms people.
<Shizuka> 13ninja-asuka
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you so silly
<KnightLunaire> into the kool aid pit!
<Bronysith> inb4, possession
<ekips> everything's so purple
<Sundaysmile> reminds me of that shaun of the dead bit
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: only partially, many choose another culture or dont like their own, its very common
<StinkomanFan> You can jump into the Blood, but you can never be free
<StinkomanFan> A truck marked NERV holding a container of gas
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Well indeed, since Culture nowadays are blended quite nicely, which gives more open sightness and choice on believes of how to life and act.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: A great evolution<3
<StinkomanFan> SUBTLE
<KnightLunaire> when is the next angel coming? not enough blood and explosions in the last 10 minutes
<Bronysith> CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
<Sumica> 00,10soon™
<ekips> KnightLunaire it's nearer than you think
<KnightLunaire> :D
<StinkomanFan> Nope, too much action, time for school
<Vordox> <--- Siscon? XD
<Sundaysmile> wat
<twilight_sprinkle> guilt for what
<Rustyheadphones> cue angel attack
<pot80> :D
<Sumica> 00,10and shinji is molested again
<Sundaysmile> guilt for putting his sis in the hospital
<Vordox> Suddenly Near Sex guys
<Vordox> XD
<StinkomanFan> ANOTHER GUY WHO WANTS INTO SHINJI'S PANTS
<twilight_sprinkle> Sundaysmile: how did that happen?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: when shinji first piloted the eva, when the third angel attacked, the dudes sister was injured
<KnightLunaire> shinji fondue
<Sundaysmile> the first attack
<Michael> lawl
<Sumica> 00,10man just think what molestia would be like
<Kandarihu> Guys, it's just an innocent glomp.
<Bronysith> Sumica: Ill ask her
<StinkomanFan> We need a counter for people who want to make filthy love to that dork.
<Dark_Horst> i'm amazed the penguin didnt try yet
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: oh, i see thx
<Vordox> Sumica: Molestia in an EVA?+
<Sundaysmile> shinji was the pilot
<KnightLunaire> glomp doesn't sound innocent at all
<Rustyheadphones> Molestia as an angel? we're doomed
<Kencolt> Apparently, being terminally miserable and eternally sad is sexy. Wish to heck I'd know THAT back in the day.
<Sundaysmile> more fan service
<Sumica> 00,10well the penguin was waiting for shinji in the bathroom
<ekips> ohgod I'm imagining that right now Rustyheadphones
<Vordox> <--- Legsocks?
<Dark_Horst> dirty little penguin
<StinkomanFan> Poor Shinji probably will act like one of the Venture kids in bed. "SHE'S TOUCHING MY SPECIAL SQUARE!"
<Vordox> Kencolt: XD Wrong millenium, Kenny
<Michael> Rustyheadphones: make a crossover :3
<Bronysith> yay, asuka developing character
<Sumica> 00,10oh what's this Auska is opening up and happy
<ekips> Bronysith as if it would matter
<Dark_Horst> the designer of that suit sure was a normal guy without any background thoughts
<ekips> Bronysith ;)
<Vordox> Dat plot
<KnightLunaire> plugging the plot
<StinkomanFan> oh look, butts
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, you mean Dean?
<Rustyheadphones> Michael: I would, but I don't know much about NGE
<Vordox> <-- Low Ride too
<Wrek> 05back with custom ramen soup
<Wrek> 05<3
<twilight_sprinkle> the world is fll of great th- oh shit its an angel!
<Dark_Horst> he totally did not intend to see halway nude 14 year olds when he designed that suit
<KnightLunaire> yeah, what pervert
<StinkomanFan> Exactly Kandarihu
<Afflict> FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
<Dark_Horst> what asuka said
<Afflict> why don't they talk?
<Sumica> 00,10good thing she admited she was happy
<Michael> oh yes
<Verdant_Wasp> no shit asuka
<Bronysith> Wrek: did you steal from me? thats what i had for dinner :|
<ekips> this can only end well
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 shit hits the fan
<Shizuka> 13what? character development for my asuka? oh we can't have that, DROP THE BRIDGE
<Stormy> I don't know
<twilight_sprinkle> nope no happiness for you
<Sumica> 00,10come play with us auska
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Vordox> <--- Stable mental mind
<Bronysith> ANGEL
<KnightLunaire> SYMBOLISM!
<Michael> possession?
<Stormy> I've seen that guy here a couple times though
<Dark_Horst> should that happen?
<pot80> hallucination much?
<Vordox> WELL
<Vordox> FUCK
<Dark92Enigma> break the walls down
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: well, EVAs are angels actually
<Stormy> recently returned
<Sundaysmile> not a hallucination
<Sumica> 00,10nice drift
<Sundaysmile> the real deal
<Verdant_Wasp> wait
<twilight_sprinkle> 3000 points!
<Afflict> oh cool
<ekips> so that's why they wanted us to hold that EVA
<Stormy> I'm guessing he just took a look at the nick list and left when there wasn't anyone he recongnized
<Stormy> -.-
<Verdant_Wasp> asuka's not supposed to be in there
<Rustyheadphones> Well, there goes one of our main Characters
<StinkomanFan> I'm gonna be blunt here, even with sound I probably wouldn't be able to figure out WTF is going on
<Dark92Enigma> ASUKA NOOOOOOOOOOO
<DerpyMuffins> America is a bitch
<Vordox> Well, Asuka's f'cked
<Everto> Favorite homestuck song
<Everto> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-_3T3JLnoM
<StinkomanFan> How come the lower half of his glasses are having a siezure?
<Michael> asuka ded? wow, that was more fast that i could imagine
<twilight_sprinkle> DerpyMuffins: why, they even gave them a free eva unit
<Vordox> Well she was happy
<Vordox> When Happy
<Vordox> Shit goes down
<Vordox> And you go sad again, simply plot points
<Verdant_Wasp> why asuka?!
<Stormy> RDX used to have a channel on here for his forum; he was probably looking for those people
<ekips> Vordox or you die
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, you get what you paid for.
<DerpyMuffins> twilight_sprinkle: Didn't that suit just blow up?
<Sumica> 00,10So i hear you like inapprorate music.
<StinkomanFan> ...Why does Shinji have breastplates?
<Vordox> "Just as we fear" So Gendou f'cked it up?
<Stormy> okay, I'll humor your Homestuck stuff
<MLP_Brovakiin> StinkomanFan: Why don't you?
<Michael> nuuuuuuu
<Stormy> Since you had to listen to me talk about MLP for half an hour :P
<Everto> Lol
<ekips> "it's blue"
<Everto> Stormy, you act like you despise Homestuck
<twilight_sprinkle> DerpyMuffins: but...it was free
<dreadhoof> saddest fight ever....
<Verdant_Wasp> who the hell the script of this scene?
<Stormy> I don't, haha
<AdamTheDuck> ekips, in the original series, they identified angels by their blood type, blue meant angel
<Everto> You only got through the first act
<ekips> that's everything you can tell from an indepth analysis
<Everto> :P
<Stormy> I just can't get into it
<ekips> AdamTheDuck oh
<Sundaysmile> most brutal fight ever
<Verdant_Wasp> i want him fired. asuka!
<Stormy> because the first part is so boring
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: So it was Blue all along?
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, it's like they originally wrote Shinji as a woman and changed his gender at the last minute considering how immasuline he is
<Stormy> So I feel like I'm missing out
<Michael> i love sad scenes
<Everto> You know how you have a friend that shows you a movie
<Everto> So you watch it
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, and Asuka as a man?
<Stormy> I didn't even get through the first act
<KnightLunaire> maybe shinji was made for the yaoi fangirls
<Everto> And you're friend looks over and you purposely not smile
<Stormy> or even most of the way through it
<Vordox> Sumica: Nothing inappropriate here
<Dark92Enigma> Verdant_Wasp: You're fired, you're fired, YOU'RE FIREEEEEEEEED YOU'RE FIREEEEEEEEEEED
<ekips> KnightLunaire what with the yaoi fanboys?
<Everto> And he says, "Just wait, it gets better"
<Vordox> whoa arm wtf?
<Sumica> 00,10oh just wait
<Everto> But it doesn't get better
<KnightLunaire> @ekips: them too
<Dark92Enigma> Verdant_Wasp: (that joke was from A Bug's Life)
<Everto> And through the whole movie, he keeps saying that
<Vordox> OH THAT'S CHEATING
<Everto> Well this is nothing like that
<Michael> wow
<Dark92Enigma> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
<Verdant_Wasp> ok, cause i didnt get it
<Michael> dat was unexpected
<StinkomanFan> Oh look, the nightmare of every japanese child EVER
<Cameh_Dude> ew
<Stormy> I seriously just don't have the time or attention span to sit through all that
<Everto> Because it actually does get better
<Dark92Enigma> THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY
<Stormy> I tried twice
<Stormy> the second time I got a little farther
<Everto> How far?
<StinkomanFan> Aaaaand without audio it looks like Shinji grew gills
<Stormy> there wasn't even a story yet
<Dark92Enigma> YOU CAN'T MAKE ME MASCULINE, THAT IS NOT PART OF MY JOB
<Verdant_Wasp> oh yes we can
<Stormy> I had to find objects around the armless guy's house
<Everto> Yea
<Stormy> it was like
<Sumica> 00,10assuming direct controll
<Everto> What
<Stormy> what is the point of this
<Vordox> Inb4 Nightmare fuel....
<Everto> Umm
<KnightLunaire> asuka had to choke a bitch
<Everto> You can skip that you know
<twilight_sprinkle> now you get to watch your eva kill your friend firsthand, have fun shinji
<Sumica> 00,10I know you will feel thins shinji
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God I love this scene...
<dreadhoof> :'(
<Stormy> really?
<Stormy> I had a friend who told me I couldn't
<Kandarihu> Now if only EVA-03 was equipped with the dummy plug.
<Everto> The first video game
<Michael> oh boy
<StinkomanFan> ...Please tell me Shinji didn't grow gills
<Sundaysmile> Rape bot activated
<Everto> Is just to show you what happened to the house
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, HDCP stripper is like $299 USD
<KnightLunaire> xD
<Everto> You can go to the next part at any time you want
<Spyrorocks> which would be required for hd stream.
<StinkomanFan> By the looks of it...
<Dark92Enigma> StinkomanFan: no.......much worse
<Michael> remote control
<twilight_sprinkle> and perfectly fitting music too
<Sundaysmile> Pretentious soundtract time!
<Michael> and my fav music
<Dark92Enigma> DAT inappropiate theme
<Stormy> hmm
<StinkomanFan> Gendo is a complete an utter monster
<CriticKitten> Time for unfitting music
<Vordox> It's still not inapproriate
<Kandarihu> It's fitting for the tragedy of this scene.
<Shizuka> 13remember, asuka is feeling this now
<DerpyMuffins> This is some fitting music
<Everto> HDCP stripper...
<MadSurge> BOOO THIS MUSIC SUCKS
<Everto> That sounds perfect
<ekips> so, what exactly is the reason for using inappropriate music?
<Vordox> This is NOT inappropriate music Mica...
<Dark_Horst> well he COULD have just ripped the capsule out
<Sundaysmile> feeling ALL of it
<Stormy> please don't
<Everto> No more copyright errors for me
<Dark92Enigma> why don't you put THE PRAYER while you're at------oh, thanks for reminding us Shizuka :)
<Stormy> lol
<Verdant_Wasp> I'm not sure what they want me to feel right now
<MadSurge> Death metal would be appropriate now
<Cameh_Dude> :'(
<StinkomanFan> So... Would Guile's theme go with this?
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: nah
<Sumica> 00,10she feels alllllll of this
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Verdant_Wasp> sure
<DerpyMuffins> Dayum
<KnightLunaire> NOM NOM NOM
<Michael> all the depression
<StinkomanFan> RIP AND TEAR
<ekips> oh mai
<Dark92Enigma> CUE GUILE'S THEME
<Spyrorocks> That will allow you to do full 1080p
<Barbetos> All da feels
<Verdant_Wasp> so, isnt that enough
<Invi> Sumica, not anymore
<Vordox> Sumica: THIS IS NOT INAPPROPRIATE MUSIC
<StinkomanFan> YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS
<Anger> what the actual fuck man
<KnightLunaire> RIP AND TEAR
<Stormy> then the Hub probably costs like what
<Everto> Anyway Stormy, you can technically skip all the walk-around video games in the story
<DerpyMuffins> Such great music
<Spyrorocks> through component outputs
<Saturn> 08,01KnightLunaire: YES!
<Barbetos> Needs more blood I think.
<Stormy> $30 USD per month?
<Barbetos> Not convinced
<twilight_sprinkle> well at least he doesntsee it
<Saturn> 08,01KnightLunaire: i'm so glad someone else knows of that
<Spyrorocks> LOL i dont think that much
<Stormy> just a guess
<KnightLunaire> *brohoff*
<Stormy> well it probably comes with some other channels
<Verdant_Wasp> he's probably hearing the music too
<Shizuka> 13listen
<KnightLunaire> *hoof
<KnightLunaire> xD
<Vordox> THE TUBE
<Vordox> THE F*CKING TUUUBE
<Stormy> I don't know if you can buy just that one
<Saturn> 08,01and StinkomanFan
<MadSurge> Until someone comes out and says "OMG YOU HURT ME SO MUCH" that is not canon
<Michael> nom
<Vordox> OOOOOOH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
<Sumica> 00,10the scream
<Dark92Enigma> STOP IT SHINIJI, YOU'RE JUST-.....CONFUSED
<Everto> I'm gonna go. Restart my computer to play GW2
<Kandarihu> .................................................................dang
<Everto> Cya
<Stormy> k, see ya
<Cameh_Dude> omg
<StinkomanFan> es Saturn?
<Dark92Enigma> 6_9
<Sumica> 00,10you could hear her scream in the end
<Sundaysmile> double rainbows
<KnightLunaire> boom, shinji is pregnant
<Michael> rainbow <3
<Saturn> 08,01StinkomanFan: you too
<Anger> rainbow ftw

<KnightLunaire> no
<Verdant_Wasp> lol
<Rainbow> Blood everywhere

<Barbetos> I want that
<Waz> Vordox: foreshadowing? xD

<Vordox> So now Shinji dies aftering becoming pure energy?
<Wrek> 05so evas are angels, but domesticated?
<Wrek> 05:|
<Michael> third impact?
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, not domesticated
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, controlled, restricted
<Sumica> 00,10enslaved
<Sundaysmile> and then eveyone died
<Waz> mor elike prisioners Wrek... i think
<StinkomanFan> "Ohey, wassup?"
<CriticKitten> Welp time for the world to end. :D
<Wrek> 05right
<Verdant_Wasp> is this the last movie?
<Waz> nope... 2/4

<Sundaysmile> no verdant
<GabeMoist> YAY

<Dark_Horst> soooo... everybody gonna die now?
<StinkomanFan> That's what you get for punching Jesus, the apacolypse
<Anger> yay

<Verdant_Wasp> how the hell are they gonna make 2 more movies?
<Anger> everyone is going to die
<Invi> Dark_Horst, yeah. why not. sounds fun
<MethFromCryDev> Im back
<twilight_sprinkle> its not the end yet btw
<Verdant_Wasp> half the cast is dead
<Vordox> Verdant_Wasp: Very very nice pacing? :P
<Shizuka> 13remember the first rule of evangelion
<Michael> now i want the next movie :(
<Waz> wait for the final scene
<Shizuka> 13it gets worse
<Sundaysmile> can't wait for the third
<Vordox> Shizuka: XD
<twilight_sprinkle> its not over peeps
<Afflict> wb
<CriticKitten> Verdant_Wasp: Because.
<StinkomanFan> Just like Patrick predicted Anger
<Dark92Enigma> AND WORSE
<twilight_sprinkle> theres one more scene after the credits
<KnightLunaire> jeezus
<Vordox> Shizuka: Well, tell us when you find a good version of Part 3!
<Michael> Shizuka: dat is why it's awesome :D
<Shizuka> 13sumi going to show the first six minutes of 3 right
<Kencolt> Shizuka: And VASTLY more confusing.
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, in the original series, they explain that the armour isn't there for proctection for the EVA, but rather a means for the pilot to control the EVA
<Kandarihu> Verdant_Wasp, they originally planned for 4 movies, but they gave up and they're only doing 3.
<Sumica> 00,10yus
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Sundaysmile> YES
<MethFromCryDev> So...
<Vordox> Sumica: oly 6 minutes? Bad version?
<MethFromCryDev> How is everyone?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Tumblr Spotlight: Slice of Life / The Strange Adventures of Crackpot / Ask Discord
<Wrek> 05these guys pronounce the g in evangelion strange :|
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: official version, the only one of decent quality to get out
<Sundaysmile> DO IT YOU SILLY FILLY
<Sumica> 00,10problem is the subs like to break on popout player
<Afflict> bored, just getting some cleaning done
<Vordox> Shizuka: Oooh,cam corder, but what about us non native japanese speakers?
<MethFromCryDev> Oh
<Verdant_Wasp> the movies seem to be okay
<Waz> im watching End of Eva on January 8th so this was nice
<MethFromCryDev> Wb Stormy?
<Verdant_Wasp> just a bit too different from the original for my taste
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: not camrip, it's the first six minutes as broadcast on tv to promote the release, fully subbed
<Vordox> Waz: You're a wiz then here. :D
<Vordox> Shizuka: Whoa!
<Shizuka> 13the camrips are scattered around the rest of the movie and atrocious quality
<Vordox> <3 Can't wait!
<Waz> Vordox: ... xD
<Michael> brb
<KnightLunaire> gah
<CriticKitten> The first six minutes manages to make even less sense.
<GabeMoist> I never did understand this series much
<CriticKitten> Yes, that's possible.
<StinkomanFan> Is it like six minutes of DBZ where it's the main charactors yelling?
<Barbetos> Er is the third movie going to be shown?
<PrincessLuna> that moment when you purchase origins of species and are happy
<Barbetos> Am I reading that right?
<KnightLunaire> shinji is voiced by a woman oO
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, it's an entire battle against an angel.
<CriticKitten> Third movie's not out in good quality yet. Only a six minute clip of it.
<Shizuka> 13KnightLunaire: most young male characters are, not limited to japan
<StinkomanFan> ...Actually can we stream DBZ on here? I need either that or wrestling to get my Testesterone up.
<KnightLunaire> weird
<Shizuka> 13see tara strong playing timmy turner
<jcelios> o rite
<Barbetos> I figured sumi was talking about showing the 3rd movie even in bad quality but having issues with the sub
<GabeMoist> StinkomanFan, you need TTGL
<Shizuka> 13it's the first six minutes, subbed on youtube
<Barbetos> Meh. I can always see it later. I will be back in a bit.
<Vordox> Wrek: I have a question
<Sumica> 00,10I cant get it in a good quality cam rip
<StinkomanFan> TTGL?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i thought Shinjis english dub VA was a man?
<Vordox> Wrek: What's NC's "better" stuff?
<Sumica> 00,10they are all shitcams
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: gurren lagann
<Wither> i need desktop ponies /)O,......,O(\
<Waz> Shizuka: or Drake Bell playing Timmy in the live action movie... wait...
<StinkomanFan> Ah.
<Kandarihu> Tara Stron voiced other young boy roles, like Omi from Xaolin Showdown.
<Barbetos> Well, this means I will have to travel to japan and watch it there
<Shizuka> 13rule one go!
<Sumica> 00,10side note Desktop ponies has been updated
<CriticKitten> Omi :3
<Verdant_Wasp> oh oh
<Michael> back
<Kandarihu> Stinger time
<CriticKitten> And then
<GabeMoist> Waz, that's trippy. When are we watching it here?
<CriticKitten> NOPE
<Michael> lol
<StinkomanFan> SPEAROW'D
<Vordox> Dat Cliffhanger break...?

<CriticKitten> No apolocalypse for you.
<KnightLunaire> spear of longinus?
<Waz> LET THERE BE YAOI
<Vordox> THAT WAS SHORt
<Sumica> 00,10unit 6
<Vordox> TOO SHORT
<Verdant_Wasp> and then buttsex
<Dark_Horst> ....impact denied?
<StinkomanFan> KEEP OUT
<Bronysith> Verdant_Wasp: lots
<Shizuka> 13according to wiki, 90% of this teaser isn't in rebuild 3
<Vordox> Unit 8...?
<Waz> GabeMoist: what?
<Sundaysmile> Q
<Verdant_Wasp> ASUKA?!
<Kandarihu> ASUKA WITH AN EYEPATCH
<StinkomanFan> Q
<Michael> q

<Sundaysmile> MORE FAN SERVICE!
<CriticKitten> LIAR
<GabeMoist> She got better
<alexxm|colt> we want fanservice
<Barbetos> Q. Discord. DeLancey. Whatever.
<Michael> asuka is now a pirate
<MethFromCryDev> ignored.
<Sumica> 00,10see broken subs
<ekips> I wonder if there is any good fanart of Shin....OHMYGOD
<Shizuka> 13oh well
<AdamTheDuck> Pirate Asuka is best Asuka!
<Vordox> Time to listen well.
<Kandarihu> Sumica, no we don't
<Shizuka> 13the awesome is what we're here for :)
<Scarlet_Wings> yay
<Wither> xD
<Vordox> Let's see how my Japanese is.
<AdamTheDuck> o.O
<TrixieMuffin> Asuka with 2 peglegs
<Sundaysmile> I see an space anus
<Shizuka> 13they're rambling about decelerating in orbit
<Vordox> Shizuka: Is Phase playing again?
<StinkomanFan> Is a space anus like a Skygina?
<KnightLunaire> looks like breaking bad
<MethFromCryDev> :(
<Afflict> she's just afk
<Kandarihu> StinkomanFan, mind keeping it classy around here please?
<MethFromCryDev> :o
<Michael> are we in space?
<Verdant_Wasp> actually really only hear blablabla this time
<MethFromCryDev> I miss Geko, Neo, and Kimori'
<StinkomanFan> Sunday Smile started it
<Dark_Horst> got enough stages thereß
<DerpyMuffins> Asuka is back
<Rainbow> Cant understand anything! :P
<Kandarihu> The Evangelion Unit 02-Dash
<Shizuka> 13according to wiki, even though third impact was halted, it pretty much hosed what was left of the world
<Vordox> Asuka Lived? =3
<Verdant_Wasp> Gudu laku
<Michael> asuka is alive?
<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, indeed :$
<CriticKitten> Still can't quite see the subs, Sumi.
<Afflict> lol Geko and Neo were here a couple hours ago
<MethFromCryDev> :o
<MethFromCryDev> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnt9pRDdHk8

<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, it's the first 6:35 of Rebuild of Evangelion 3.33
<Cameh_Dude> more screaming?
<Vordox> HAI ASUKA
<Dark_Horst> it uses at fields as propulsion?
<Michael> eyepatch <3
<Shizuka> 13she's yelling for mari to support her
<jcelios> eva with no subs probably makes more sense
<DerpyMuffins> You can't kill Asuka
<StinkomanFan> This is Future Asuka, right?
<Vordox> Shizuka: I thought you said Mari was useless in 3?
<Shizuka> 13she is :P
<Vordox> XD
<Shizuka> 13she only gets that shot off :P
<Sundaysmile> pink sniper bullets?
<Rustyheadphones> Suddenly Tetris
<KnightLunaire> O_o
<Kandarihu> jcelios, nope. Even Evangelion without subs makes less sense than with it.
<Sumica> 00,10docking the hard way
<Afflict> https://soundcloud.com/sadhudubstep/gangnam-style-sadhu-remix
<Shizuka> 13expert level docking

<Dark_Horst> this thing reminds me a lot of dante 01
<MethFromCryDev> u make it?
<Shizuka> 13asuka making up for not catching sahaquiel in rebuild 2
<StinkomanFan> ...I miss Future Twilight. She was cute
<Verdant_Wasp> looks awesome and all, but wtf is going on
<Afflict> no
<Shizuka> 13instead catches shinji's tomb in orbit
<Vordox> Counting down?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, this isn't Unit 2. It's Unit 02-Dash
<Alchemist> hai
<Afflict> i wish :P
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: It's approximately 20% cooler than the previous iteration.
<Shizuka> 13epic theme time
<Vordox> Shinji's tomb? o.o
<MethFromCryDev> lol
<Alchemist> hmm, no subs
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<CriticKitten> Ohai tentacles
<twilight_sprinkle> the music eva 3.33 sounded pretty grim for the most
<Shizuka> 13asuka's annoyed by the angel attacking now
<AdamTheDuck> Wat
<Shizuka> 13see? useless mari
<StinkomanFan> TBH Shinji would've died LONG ago anyway
<Shizuka> 13arael's triumphant return
<Verdant_Wasp> she calls her glasses?
<Vordox> Jabai = "This is bad"
<Kencolt> Asuka keeps getting bucked up in this version...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> which one is this?

<Vordox> Wakagate = "I know that"

<Verdant_Wasp> keep trying vordox
<Michael> shinji!
<Vordox> Verdant_Wasp: I'm hearing phrases, okay =P
<Vordox> Verdant_Wasp: I'm not fluent, just general anime knowledge
<CriticKitten> Even when he's taking a nap, Shinji's more useful than the rest of the cast
<Waz> Kencolt: only seen the original series minus the end of eva... and i hate Asuka, is she at least a little better here?
<KnightLunaire> and then Shepard was put into project lazarus
<Verdant_Wasp> eat my one year course

<AttackWithHugs> I hope the mobs don't gain any intelligence and start breaking glass to get in. >>
<Breaking_Bad> lol
<Java> If I have multiple buildings I will create underground interconnecting tunnels between houses.
<Java> Safer than running around in panic between buildings.

<Barbetos> Its gona be awesome
<Buytoast> you silly goose

<RDash5000> Wrek: could be a bit bigger
<RDash5000> thanks
<Java> berberborscing: It's just a Lambo.

<LadyCanary> Yes Wreky.
<RDash5000> ITS CRACKLE
<James_Clydesdale> when is there a new episode??
<thelonecubone> Ohai RDash5000 and MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Java> Getting bored with Lambo cars. They are too predictable in design.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> aww the doggie
<Java> Well, I like Aventador though
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai thelonecubone ^-^
<Yahooz> oh Wrek is streaming?
<James_Clydesdale> When is there a new episode of MLP?
<LadyCanary> Yes yes
<berberborscing> Lamborghini is so different than other companies, and their first ever car that's not a bunch of rectangles is the Miura
<Fluxum> James_Clydesdale: 3 weeks
<James_Clydesdale> aww
<James_Clydesdale> :c
<Ryunosuke> oh good, more Penn and Teller :)
<Kandarihu> James_Clydesdale, next episode is in 3 weeks on Saturday morning.
<Ryunosuke> piff is second best dragon, after spike
<Ryunosuke> steve is a good dragon too
<Java> berberborscing: Miura is an excellent car design wise.
<Ryunosuke> Mr Piffles
<berberborscing> Seen the Spyker Laviolette LM85?
<RDash5000> :D
<mitamaking> 'ello
<RDash5000> ello
<Java> berberborscing: I don't remember. I had to google it. It's the Dutch made supercar right?
<Ryunosuke> legit spike sound effects :)
<RDash5000> :D
<berberborscing> I think. Not my fave car though.
<berberborscing> It's not the stupid Bugatti Veyron
<mitamaking> What am I seeing here?
<Java> berberborscing: I like Veyron.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Remnants of the Crystal King
<Java> It's..... classt
<Java> classy
<LadyCanary> Penn and Teller and some lovely TaviScratch art ^_&
<Fluxum> Dilemma. Play vidya or make an drawing for my nightmare journal
<berberborscing> Favorite car is what Russia has recently released: http://www.thewordofmatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Marussia-B2-Wallpapers-28.jpeg
<Ryunosuke> lols
<LadyCanary> :O OH WOW.
<LadyCanary> Thats amazing!!
<berberborscing> Cut pieces of cards.
<RDash5000> Crackle the magic dragon
<Java> berberborscing: Oh wow. What the engine?
<CriticKitten> Ugh.
<Ryunosuke> a little... hare
<berberborscing> Ooh, there's a Marussi B1 too.
<Ryunosuke> oh god
<Ryunosuke> dragons + bananas
<CriticKitten> Getting a migrane from hunger, and am annoyed at the pizza place taking too damn long.
<Ryunosuke> mr piff
<Java> Marussi reminds me of Indian car brand Maruti.
<otakon> You're a mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmdragon that like mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmbanana's
<Ryunosuke> magic draon stuff
<berberborscing> The Marussia B2 has a 3.5L V6 or 2.8L Turbocharged V6
<Ryunosuke> lol tellar
<GilDash> Heh, I like this guy. XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<RDash5000> zero fucks given
<otakon> Wrek: holy hell man the Octavia looks utterly magnificent so far
<Ryunosuke> awwww
<LadyCanary> Puff, the magic dragon~
<Breaking_Bad> bbl
<berberborscing> Someone wanted to know what engine Marussia B2 had
<Java> berberborscing: Nice. Even though I want to know the reliability. Is it Italian or Japan :p
<berberborscing> It's Russian.
<Fluxum> Pshh, zdrastje
<Ryunosuke> lolwut?
<Fluxum> Means Whatever in russian
<berberborscing> Found image of Marussia B1: http://www.gtspirit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/marussia_b1_live.jpg
<LadyCanary> Ha. Dat bagpipe.
<RDash5000> fluffy octavia :3
<Java> I mean the reliability, is it need a lot of taking care of like Italian cars or very reliable and rarely break down like Japanese cars.
<LadyCanary> She isnt really that fluffy.
<Wrek> 05golden cello
<LadyCanary> WOW
<LadyCanary> Shiny @_@
<berberborscing> Probably fragile like an Italian one.
<Ponies47> Wrek, Gold cello is best cello :3
<Java> berberborscing: heheh. I see.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/O191y.jpg
<TrixieMuffin> the finger trick would be really cool if he had 6 -4 afterwards
<berberborscing> Seeing how explicit the design is and how fast it can go
<Ryunosuke> that 80's cell phone
<Java> Bronysith: Dude that's depressing.
<Bronysith> Java: indeed
<LadyCanary> Once again, Sith links relevant images.
<Fluxum> Bronysith: Oh my
<Ryunosuke> swag
<Java> berberborscing: Supercars don't always equal to being fragile :/
<berberborscing> Levels of fragility: Italian = Weak, Japanese = somewhat reliable, American = Car crash and it still goes
<Java> Volvo = tank
<Bronysith> berberborscing: indeed
<RDash5000> woah
<Anger> :O
<berberborscing> I'm gonna search up if Marussia B2 is weak or strong. It had approximately 280 hp so
<LadyCanary> Hoohoo!
<Java> Also I don't believe American cars can go after a crash
<LadyCanary> Magic~
<Ryunosuke> like I said, swag
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/9kapj.jpg
<LadyCanary> Dat James Brown.
<Panda> Bronysith, true story.
<Java> I mean Top gear destroy a Toyota Hilux and it still can run.
<LadyCanary> Oooh. Funky.
<berberborscing> My brother is a very ecological person. He is saving up for a Chevy Volt ^^
<Afflict> http://www.tickld.com/images/content/36116.jpg
<Bronysith> berberborscing: government car?
<Java> Go get Tesla Roadster....
<Ryunosuke> more swag
<berberborscing> He doesn't have the money for an electric sports car...
<Java> Oh okay.
*RDash5000 claps
<berberborscing> Insurance would be extremely expensive
<Bronysith> berberborscing: well yea, insurance is a bitch
<berberborscing> Considereing it is electric AND a ssports car...
<Stormy> Hey Kimori
<Java> My country planning to subsidize and cutting taxes for hybrid cars since oil are getting expensive here.
<Kimori> hi :)
<Afflict> hey
<Stormy> I just got back :P
<berberborscing> Cuz oil is only gona be here for 50-100 more years.
<Kimori> yay
<berberborscing> then everyone's gonna wake up at 4 in the morning bicycling to their jobs
<Java> berberborscing: Yeah, nice car though. Good Miles per charge too.
<Java> berberborscing: Some of our govt official ride horses to their jobs.
<berberborscing> When oil runs out, I'll drop my jaw if I ever see a Hummer again.
<Stormy> I'm surprised Meth didn't know about DotD, heh
<Kimori> seriously?
<otakon> nice glasses
<Afflict> yep lol
<berberborscing> Gas is probably gone so fast because people drive Hummers when they should consider getting a cheaper, less bulletproof car
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> bc IDIOTS
<otakon> "DURRR, BIGGER CAR IS BETTER ALL TIMES
<berberborscing> Why I want a Ford Focus. Hopefully electric by then.
<Java> There's an old saying in China: A man have to know these things: Poetry, playing music, archery, horse riding.... I forget the rest. But yeah. a man need to learn those skills.
<thelonecubone> All Hummer drivers are Pendejos :>
<Kimori> thats sad
<otakon> Java: lol
<Panda> Males only like big cars because they are overcompensating for something that is rather small.
<berberborscing> All Hummer drivers have crazy kids... it's a moving prison
<Stormy> I wonder if he knows about the rest of the LoS series
<LadyCanary> Not all the time.
<Afflict> hmm
<Java> otakon: Good advice though. Riding horses = driving a car in modern era
<LadyCanary> That's just a stereotype, Im sure.
<Stormy> it's rare to see a young kid who only likes the originals
<Java> Archery = using a gun
<Java> poetry = literacy
<berberborscing> Life will evolve into minecraft.
<Fluxum> otakon: but what if i NEED a car that can witstand shortrange missiles when i drive in the suburbs?
<Java> music = misic
<berberborscing> Fluxum, if that ever happens, don't go there.
<berberborscing> Lol.
<Kimori> Did you ever ask him how he started playing the originals?
<Wrek> 05CD's?
<Wrek> 05no.
<berberborscing> I can never see electric Hummers...
<RDash5000> ZE MAGICKS
<alexxm|colt> ze magics
<berberborscing> Magic! *snort snort
<LadyCanary> My dad has a whole collection of CDs. Pretty nifty.
<Bronysith> anyone ever fuck up a cover letter?
<Fluxum> Wrek: what did you use to make the wood pattern?
<LadyCanary> ROCKET MAAAAAAAAN
<Stormy> No, that would be interesting to find out though
<Stormy> bleh, spyroforum thread tools are hard to use :(
<LadyCanary> Heh. ABBA.
<prince-dari> Wow, waking up at 1am, my sleeping pattern sucks.
<berberborscing> The answer is bad audio quality.
<Stormy> Lol, hey dari
<prince-dari> Hey
<RDash5000> :D
<LadyCanary> Dat glove.
<LadyCanary> Nice.
<berberborscing> My mom suggested I be a car engineer. I'd design a car for any company called the Dash. (Anyone knowing where I'm getting this from)
<Java> berberborscing: So if your brother want a car that use less gas how about the old Austin Mini?
<Stormy> Hey Spyrorocks, is there like an admin tool that can merge threads?
<Java> Mini Cooper, not the new one
<berberborscing> He wants a car thats mostly electric
<Stormy> I kind of messed up splitting one =/
<Java> oh ok
<berberborscing> He loves the economy. He's a better Fluttershy thn I.
<Java> Even though I bet Mini Cooper are much fun to drive
<Afflict> HA, he doesn't know about the rest of TLoS
<MethIsSick> Hey
<Java> I'm a big guy but I want an Austin Mini Cooper :p
<MethIsSick> If your wondering about my name, I am literally sick.
<prince-dari> Speak of the devil
<MethIsSick> Did you guys talk about me?
<berberborscing> Good luck with that :)
<Java> heheheheh
<Afflict> We just wanted to know if you knew about the rest of TLoS
<MethIsSick> Nope.
<MethIsSick> [7:20:19 PM] Meth: I only played the 1st 3, season of flame, and one of the PS2 games
<Stormy> A New Beginning and Eternal Night are the two games before Dawn of the Dragon
<Stormy> They're nothing like the originals though
<berberborscing> When I was little I dreamed of driving super fancy flying cars... but there needs to be one someday designed by a car company consistent of where the designer is a brony
<Afflict> yeah
<MethIsSick> It was the one with David Spade and Elijah Wood as voice actors
<CriticKitten> XD
<Stormy> yep
<prince-dari> I think I beat A New Beginning in one day, maybe Eternal Night too.
<RDash5000> they figured it out!
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/8RfTY.jpg every concert ever
<MethIsSick> Hey Kimori, Stormy, Prince-dari, Afflict, Spyrorocks
<Afflict> ANB was super short
<prince-dari> Hey
<Kimori> hey Meth
<Java> berberborscing: A car inspired from Rainbow Dash or Spitfire? I'm in!
<Stormy> hi
<Kimori> sorry to hear your sick
<MethIsSick> thx
<RDash5000> Bronysith: :D
<LadyCanary> =_=
<LadyCanary> RELEVANCE.
<MethIsSick> I got RSV
<berberborscing> Could be (any car company here, maybe even Lolvo) Dash
<MethIsSick> Nothing much.
<Stormy> what's RSV?
<MethIsSick> My baby Brother n Sister gave it to me.
<MethIsSick> Just a Baby Cold.
<Bronysith> htogolle
<MethIsSick> But my baby brothers and sisters gave me a baby flu
<MethIsSick> cold*
<rdibp> uh....whats this?
<berberborscing> I'm bad at drawing. When it gets to small details, I add too much
<berberborscing> And everything looks WAYYY too elaborate
<MethIsSick> How long does Pokemon Yellow take to beat?
<Bronysith> berberborscing: artists know how to take their time, it is an artform afterall...
<Java> BMW M3 and M5 design is much more boring than Lolvo though.
<Java> are
<Java> bleh grammar :/
<Bronysith> Java: lolvo?
<prince-dari> Beat as in Elite 4, or beat as in catch them all?
<prince-dari> :P
<berberborscing> Range Rover = Game Over, Volvo = Lolvo
<Stormy> probably not long at all if you know what you're doing
<Java> Volvo :
<Stormy> oh right, if you want to "catch 'em all" you'll probably have to do some trading
<LadyCanary> So much detail Wreky.
<LadyCanary> <3
<Bronysith> berberborscing: so anytime i see someone in a volvo, i should lol?
<MethIsSick> I know nothing bout Pokemon. I am a noob
<Stormy> I'm not sure how that's simulated with an emulator
<prince-dari> Not on yellow IIRC
<Stormy> oh really?
<MethIsSick> Oh.
<prince-dari> Blue and Red need to trade
<Stormy> hm
<berberborscing> lemme pull up an image i saw from an MS Sam reads stupid errors
<Stormy> that would make sense I guess
<prince-dari> But I think Yellow has them all, not sure thoguh
<prince-dari> though*
<MethIsSick> Anyone wanna see me stream?
<CriticKitten> My god, the grain on that thing....~
<prince-dari> Stream what?
<berberborscing> http://giveupinternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lolvo-love-this-car-or-give-up-internet.jpg
<Java> Bronysith: The cars are safe and strong. But the designs are plain and boring.
<MethIsSick> Spyro, Pokemon, Crash
<berberborscing> lol, Lolvo is real
<Bronysith> whats the best gift you guys received this christmas?
<Jim> Ohai
*CriticKitten misses his cello. ;_;
<prince-dari> Where you streaming?
*Bronysith glomps Jim
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Peace.
<Bronysith> Jim: long time
<MethIsSick> I might stream on twitchtv in 20 minutes
<Jim> It's sure been
<prince-dari> Ah, ok
<Kammerjunk> Not peace in the world or anything like that, just personally.

<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: my friend got this http://i.imgur.com/ewv2r.jpg
<prince-dari> Sure
<LadyCanary> Jim?!
<MethIsSick> What about Stormy and Kimori?
<berberborscing> http://0.asset.soup.io/asset/2806/9456_416f.jpeg
<LadyCanary> Whoa, hey!
<MethIsSick> Afflict already said no :(
<Jim> Hi!
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: A blind?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Jim :)
<LadyCanary> Nice to see you!
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: those sunglasses
<Stormy> sorry :(
<MethIsSick> k
<Kammerjunk> Wait, those are sunglasses?
<Kimori> I'm going to eat dinner soon, so no
<Panda> Jim, now that is a face I havent seen in a while.
<thelonecubone> Hi Jim :)
<Kimori> but maybe later, send me the link
<Stormy> watching streams is not good on this computer anyway
<MethIsSick> ok
<Jim> Finally found some time to go here again
<Stormy> super slow
<Java> Kammerjunk: Well, it's SUN glasses
<MethIsSick> :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back, Jim :)
<berberborscing> I see what you did there
<Kammerjunk> Ooooh, you clever bastard.
<Panda> Jim, ah. How is work?
<MethIsSick> Prince, make a twitch.tv account while im setting up
<MethIsSick> Just gotta take a shower first.
<Jim> Well, it's kind of exhausting, but interesting.
<prince-dari> You have to make an account to watch on it?
<Panda> Same as always then?
<MethIsSick> No, to go on the chat
<LadyCanary> What do you do Jim? Mind me asking.
<CriticKitten> Huh.
<MethIsSick> It takes 5 sec 2 sign up
<RaveBrony> Whaat, Jim? Hey there!
<prince-dari> Oh
<CriticKitten> Okay, that was cool.
<MethIsSick> No email verification or anything
<prince-dari> Ok
<Jim> LadyCanary, In the military, as a Royal Guard.
<LadyCanary> Lolwat.
<CriticKitten> ._.
<MethIsSick> www.twitch.tv/MethFromYouTube
<Jim> ohai RaveBrony
<Anger> hax
<Ryunosuke> ^
<CriticKitten> Okay, that's REALLY cool
<LadyCanary> What. Holy crap;.
<Afflict> How long are you gonna be streaming?
<GilDash> Nice.
<berberborscing> http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/The_0fa385_296733.jpg Have fun playing Arkham City now.
<MethIsSick> 3 hours or so
<LadyCanary> Even that guy's mind is full of fuck.
<Afflict> ok
<MethIsSick> Might do some Photoshop or something
<MethIsSick> Whatever really.
<MethIsSick> Prince, what games u wanna see me play?
<CriticKitten> That's a really good trick.
<RaveBrony> Funny Junk...
<RaveBrony> Doesnt work for me :(
<prince-dari> Play Spyro :P
<dreadhoof> adds....
<MethIsSick> which one?
<MethIsSick> http://www.twitch.tv/MethFromYouTube
<MLP_Brovakiin> RaveBrony: It just doesn't work :I
<MethIsSick> Link^
<alexxm|colt> dreadhoof adblock
<berberborscing> If I get one more ad I'm opening this in Chrome
<RaveBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: :(
<dreadhoof> yah... need to get that lol
<berberborscing> (my chrome has adblock)
<Kammerjunk> The best magic tricks are those done with diversion, in my opinion. That is, when you distract the audience for just a second because you can only focus on one thing at a time.
*CriticKitten snickers
<Ryunosuke> lol johnathan
<LadyCanary> Adblock. It helps.
<LadyCanary> Srsly.
<CriticKitten> Poor John.
<Panda> Kammerjunk, that is what "magic" tricks are...
<berberborscing> Alright im on chrome
<MethIsSick> which spyro, 1, 2, or 3?
<berberborscing> no more bloody ads
<CriticKitten> I'm still baffled how he did it.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<berberborscing> Who is Octavia sitting next to?
<CriticKitten> I figure it's a diversion tactic, but....
<Afflict> Have you played Enter the Dragonfly or A Hero's Tail Meth?
<Ryunosuke> vinyl
<CriticKitten> I totally missed it. O.o
<prince-dari> Start with 1
<MethIsSick> I think I did Enter the Dragonfly
<Kammerjunk> Panda: Well, the previous one was just the tapes playing a set disc.
<MethIsSick> Okay
<berberborscing> I don't see Vinyl Scratch. lol
<Ryunosuke> 1\
<berberborscing> C4!!!!!
<Nyst> You can trick people with devices, smoke and mirrors, but it's far easier to just trick people into missing the obvious.
<MethIsSick> Be Right Back, taking this shower.
<Panda> CriticKitten, seeing it on a screen and not in person just makes the tactic that much harder to follow.
<CriticKitten> I do enjoy magic though. It's just the right sort of sleight of hand.
<berberborscing> ^
<CriticKitten> Fun to watch.
<RDash5000> ^
<CriticKitten> But it's not easy to fool me. XD
<tak025> HI EVERYPONY:)
<CriticKitten> Normally.
<berberborscing> Hello, caps-crazy.
<CriticKitten> Magic though? I always feel like a total dummy.
<RDash5000> sup tak025
<Nyst> It's easier to trick you into looking somewhere else then it is to hide something from you though.
<PonyGuyRulz> Hello
<Afflict> I should play LSD on stream so you can all see me shit my pants
<CriticKitten> .... O.o
<Stormy> o.O wat
<tak025> sup bro

<tak025> wuuuutt!!!
<Panda> It is a trick tank.
<Kammerjunk> Well, he was obviously hiding the goldfish in his... skin?
<Afflict> I've been meaning to watch that for a while now
<RDash5000> ^
<Buytoast> he gave birth with his hands
<GilDash> Very nice...
<Buytoast> impressive
<tak025> right
<prince-dari> I knew she'd like it, she's a sucker for cute things.
<CriticKitten> The tank's reflective, maybe? O.o
<Panda> ^
<PonyGuyRulz> hax I call hax
<Champion_of_Harmony> i see though the illusion, theres a mirror in the tank
<berberborscing> He's using the console commands in real life.
<Panda> It is.
<LadyCanary> Is Teller part fish?
<CriticKitten> But damn, that's fricking cool.

<Stormy> there was just an argument on spyroforum about that movie
<berberborscing> And the more that you know, then the more you can grow, then the more loopholes where the law can go

<Punkie_Pue> I dont get it
<berberborscing> My face decides to spam freckles everywhere.
<CriticKitten> And he's on this show already? Welp, so much for my life. :p
<Stormy> I liked the movie, but you do have to admit the dragons are pretty ugly
<berberborscing> At 15, I'll be ont his show for having no life anywhere except my PS3 ^^

<berberborscing> At 12, a huge mole is gonna come out of the ground
<alexxm> flash crashed
*CriticKitten snickers.
<prince-dari> Well, I still think the main dragon is cute, but not the others.
<berberborscing> This mole poses a threat to our planet. It has STDs in his teeth.
<Ryunosuke> heh
<Stormy> Yeah
<LadyCanary> Oh shut up.
<LadyCanary> he's a little kid.

<LadyCanary> Not too bad.
<berberborscing> Tell me kammer
<Panda> Ok, for a little kid, he knows too much. We need to make sure he does not multiply.
<berberborscing> NOAW
<Punkie_Pue> I think the inside of the box had a false bottom
<Ryunosuke> its an old trick but still
<CriticKitten> And the hand's not fake from the looks of it. That is pretty clever.
<PonyGuyRulz> good show, jolly good show

<prince-dari> Lawl
<Stormy> see ya Afflict
<CriticKitten> That's really high praise, though.
<Panda> Still, you have to give him credit for being able to pull those off.
<Kammerjunk> Hah, looked like the father was booing.
<CriticKitten> Seriously.
<MethIsSick> Just telling the truth stormy
<LadyCanary> Indeed, CriticKitten.
<Stormy> maybe to other 14 year olds
<LadyCanary> Good for him ^_^ lots more motivation to continue on
<berberborscing> If you tell me the secret, I'll give you a cookie ('o.)
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Must mean a lot to him to get it from Penn and Teller.
<MethIsSick> lol
<Ryunosuke> oh mai
<CriticKitten> Having masters of the craft tell you that? Man, that's some fantastic stuff for someone his age.
<Punkie_Pue> Im interested in how this trick works.
<Ryunosuke> a magicianne
<CriticKitten> I hope he keeps it up.

<Stormy> but most of us here are way older than you :P

<prince-dari> Malefor
<MethIsSick> Oh.
<Stormy> Yep
*GilDash raises hand.
<Kammerjunk> I'm kidding, he's the sub.

<prince-dari> Oh God
<Panda> It is Trixie, Jim.
<Stormy> good ol' nine-year-olds
<CriticKitten> O.o

<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: the trick is, she makes him the slave
<RDash5000> don't do that...
<dreadhoof> :D
<GilDash> She's got a lisp.
<Jim> rrrrrrrr
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: He has no idea what he's getting into, but by God he'll love it.
<Bronysith> GilDash: its cute
<Stormy> I guess you could say... interesting?
<Jim> It's not a magic trick, she's just very into kink.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: indeed...
<GilDash> Bronysith: I wasn't saying anything about it, I just noticed was all.
<MethIsSick> Did they get there parents on you?

<Jim> How?!
<CriticKitten> Wow, she untied that knot damn fast.
<MethIsSick> So he is 14?
<Stormy> so... 13?
<Panda> And kids, that is what happens when you bone in a small, confined area.
<Stormy> maybe 14
<MLP_Brovakiin> Panda: XD
<Stormy> I don't know when their birthdays are
<MethIsSick> He would be 14, since it is December
<MethIsSick> Oh.
<GilDash> So, they used the jacket to clean up the mess. XD
<Jim> Breasticles.
<Panda> GilDash, what mess ;)
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Well, practice makes perfect.
<CriticKitten> That was really cool.
<Paul> Lol
<alexxm> well i have no idea how that was done
<LadyCanary> Bravo.
<GilDash> Panda: Well, that was part of the trick. ;)
<MethIsSick> what did they fight about?
<CriticKitten> But I'm baffled at how she got the knots and coat off that quick.
<Stormy> I don't remember
<Paul> y are we not watching Hub?
<Stormy> probably like who gets to be a moderator or something
<berberborscing> India will be soon releasing their first supercar: http://im.rediff.com/money/2012/oct/11dc-avanti1.jpg

<CriticKitten> I appreciate how they don't reveal the way it works.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, Scottish lad.
<MethIsSick> Do they still use the forums?
<prince-dari> Nah
<Stormy> no
<CriticKitten> It leaves the whole thing a mystery.
<Kammerjunk> I swear, Scottish accents are so amazing.
<Jim> ^
<Panda> CriticKitten, they dont have to because I will :)
<Stormy> Hail came back a few years later with a different name
<Paul> Scottish voice reaing that:Can't unhear
<berberborscing> The DC Avanti is India's first sports car
<Stormy> But she didn't post much
<Paul> oh he' lad!
<prince-dari> Either I've gone crazy or I do remember Malefor coming back to IRC fairly recently just the once
<Paul> lol
<CriticKitten> But yeah, that one was cool too.
<GilDash> Panda: Do you actually have an interest in illusions?
<Stormy> and Aicebo freaked her out by posting on her forum :P
<Stormy> huh, really?

<Jim> Time machine
<Panda> Good. He didnt fool them.
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
<PonyGuyRulz> doctor who
<Bronysith> PonyGuyRulz: that self advertisement
<Scoot-Scootaloo> PonyGuyRulz: I see your advertising your own things, eh?
<Ryunosuke> lol
<CriticKitten> Huh.
<Yahooz> uh oh
<Punkie_Pue> nice.
<CriticKitten> Wow.
<LadyCanary> :O Wow!
<Mr_Anybody> :P
<Yahooz> DID SOMEONE CALL HIS NAME?
<LadyCanary> Good for him!
<CriticKitten> He got 'em.
<Kammerjunk> It's obvious, really.
<Kammerjunk> He teleported it.
<alexxm> how the hell did he pull that off
<RDash5000> inb4 he's a time lord
<Scoot-Scootaloo> HEY EVERYONE! Go spam PonyguyRulz's stuff with Scootaloo!
<Mr_Anybody> someone fool morgon freeman
<Nyst> he used a different trick
<Jim> RDash5000, Too late
<Punkie_Pue> He wrote with his heel
<Buytoast> not bad
<Java> a secret hole in his pants maybe
<GilDash> So, after going on and getting called out for being lazy he actually managed to fool them the second time? Awesome.
<Yahooz> Scoot-Scootaloo: you mean LadyGaga images
<Nyst> maybe he can write with his toes?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Umm... am I seeing somethng in the stream?
<GilDash> Dat Rarity.
<Kammerjunk> Well, he said that he didn't write it.
<CriticKitten> He had to have written the prediction during the event, but that's just about all I can reason out.
<RDash5000> brb
<Champion_of_Harmony> I see a image....
<Java> sexy rarty
<Ryunosuke> and folded it up?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> EWWWW Rarity :|
<Ponies47> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Mr_Anybody> wat da fek rarity?
<Yahooz> He be back
<Scoot-Scootaloo> and Yahooz, that works too~
<Champion_of_Harmony> Sword! Give me sight! beyond sight!
<GilDash> There's nothing there, what are you on about?
<Kammerjunk> Teller produced a grand total of 2401 coins.
<Buytoast> 4
<Jim> 42
<Buytoast> ITS 4
<Kammerjunk> It's totally 2401. L is real.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> 4!!!
<Mr_Anybody> b
<Punkie_Pue> that an epensive call
<Panda> All the above because he is a piggy bank.
<Java> pound? this is a UK show?
<Punkie_Pue> yes
<Nyst> If he did write it down, he had to do it after the rock paper scissors.
<Kammerjunk> Java: It sure is.
<GilDash> Java: It's on ITV, so yes.
<SirGanjalf> I'd like to see some of them street magicians seen in TV, in that show
<Java> wpw
<Java> wow
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: Or maybe he had two pieces of paper, one in each shoe.
<Mr_Anybody> lawl dat commercial skip
<Java> Since it's Las Vegas I thought it's an US show
<Nyst> true, but then he still had to write down the scores and the words.
<Punkie_Pue> Kammerjunk. how would he know the dart scores?
<Wrek> 051 more ep after this than more drawing
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: With every possible dart score? Not to mention "Housey" which is not a real word?
<Wrek> 05this is basically my break
<CriticKitten> I dunno, I'm stumped how he concealed all of that.
<Mr_Anybody> why must the brits be so funny?
<Kammerjunk> Punkie_Pue: I told you, he's a wizard.
<thelonecubone> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<RDash5000> back
<Java> Nyst: Magnet?
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<Nyst> Okay so the soonest he could have written those was right after the words.
<CriticKitten> To write down the answers without ANYONE noticing for all of that time?
<CriticKitten> That alone is clever.
<Nyst> sleigh of hand.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Focus is a tricky thing, I guess.
<Punkie_Pue> Bex?
<Mr_Anybody> he has a COD perk
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe someone Did notice,they dont ask the audience
<Nyst> Our eyes see everything, but our brains only focus on one thing at a time.
<Jim> I would not dare being on first row in a magic show
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Mr_Anybody: Extreme Conditioning?
<twilight_sprinkle> and they didnt show the magician to us at all times
<alexxm> but still his hands didn't go near his trouser pockets from what i saw
<Jim> I would be hexed
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: A truth used by magicians just as by pickpockets
<CriticKitten> And he didn't use his pocket apparently either.
<Nyst> Kammerjunk: totally.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Of course he didn't, he teleported it.
<alexxm> CriticKitten but still his hands didn't go near his trouser pockets from what i saw
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe he has some mechanism under his suit with string that writes depending on how he moved his arm
<twilight_sprinkle> or his leg
<twilight_sprinkle> or any part really
<Panda> CriticKitten, that has yet to be proven. They didnt check his clothing or his shoes for any tricks.
<Nyst> Why use mechanical deception when you can hide things in plain sight?
<Mr_Anybody> why does he have concrete in his head?
<Jim> haha
<LadyCanary> Why not
<Kammerjunk> Mr_Anybody: Because wh-
<Punkie_Pue> wHY Dont you have concrete on your head?
<Kammerjunk> dammit
<Nyst> sounds hollow
<Jim> It brings him joy, so why not
<Ryunosuke> lol
<Jim> I'm sure it's the box that sounds hollow
<Java> New TF2 hat
<Mr_Anybody> haters gonna hate
<Jim> or that might be part of the illusion
<Punkie_Pue> whoa!
<CriticKitten> xD
<SirGanjalf> Diverting attention is basically the essence of illusion
<Scoot-Scootaloo> MLG Magic Skillz~
<Jim> So pro
<Mr_Anybody> magic *snort*
<MethIsSick> [8:04:11 PM] Meth: Streaming Spyro: http://www.twitch.tv/MethFromYouTube

<MethIsSick> [8:04:11 PM] Meth: Streaming Spyro: http://www.twitch.tv/MethFromYouTube
<Kammerjunk> Uh-huh, stare at him carefully.
<alexxm> Panda there'd probably check during the commercial and would say if they found any proof he lied to penn and teller about the pocket stuff
<prince-dari> Oh God no, he said MLG
<SirGanjalf> And that guy was definitely good at it
<CriticKitten> ....
<Buytoast> ha
<Stormy> =/
<Ryunosuke> hax
<Mr_Anybody> wat the fek
<LadyCanary> ....HOLY SHIT.
<Jim> Whoa!
<Java> ......
<MethIsSick> I did^^
<Panda> alexxm, we can only hope.
<Buytoast> impressive
<CriticKitten> But.
<Java> whoawhoawhoa
<Jim> How?
<CriticKitten> Wait.
<Stormy> do we need to set the flood limit higher now?
<Drew> yeah, hax
<RDash5000> WOW
<LadyCanary> I dont even.
<Jim> How did he put them on, inside the box, and then put the protective visor on?
<CriticKitten> And he was holding the box that whole time....wow.
<Jim> WHAT
<Stormy> or lower
<Panda> Hm... interesting. That was one I couldnt follow, unless it was a gimmick planned before the show started.
<Mr_Anybody> The concrete cube: Immune to headshots
<twilight_sprinkle> well with all the junk flying around from the hits, he couldve put on him quickly
<Kammerjunk> Teller is a fourth-dimensional being. He does not care for our walls.
<LadyCanary> Shhhhh.
<TrixieMuffin> i guess one of the arms is fake
<Wrek> 05he covered tellers hadn when he was knockign the ball
<prince-dari> Hah, yeah
<Java> CriticKitten: Or is it a pair of fake hands?
<Wrek> 05his covered hand slipperd it up the crack
<Wrek> 05from this pocket
<Stormy> seriously though
<Wrek> 05is my guess
<Stormy> one link will do
<Jim> ahh
<CriticKitten> Hrm, maybe
<Jim> that explains the knocking
<Mr_Anybody> we need to watch another noaw
<Stormy> spamming it everywhere won't make people join
<Jim> so he would know when to move his arm
<Stormy> contrary to the popular belief of spambots
<Panda> Wrek, quite possible. The billiard ball was the distraction though. Ment to be the focal point.
<CriticKitten> That would make sense, would need to see it again to be sure.
<MirrorImage> yep, and we're so focused on the knocking that we don't notice the move with the other hand
<Ryunosuke> oh noes, time travelers
<Scoot-Scootaloo> It sounds like someone is about to get...
*Scoot-Scootaloo puts on shades
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ...nailed.
<RDash5000> i has egg nog. let the awesomeness commence
<Jim> Yeeeeeaaaaah
<PonyGuyRulz> http://goo.gl/SwFpY
<Scoot-Scootaloo> YEAHHHHHHHH
<CriticKitten> That's the art of magic, though: diversion.
<Wrek> 05btw this is the rarity so far
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Mr_Anybody> have i not heard of this show because it's british, or because my head is stuck in the sand?
<twilight_sprinkle> in the previous one there was also the bit with the glove, maybe this guy with in on it
<CriticKitten> Noice.
<Drew> nice!!!
<Kammerjunk> Looking good, of course.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohmai, Wrekart :$
<MLP_Brovakiin> Looks great Wrek :)
<LadyCanary> Lovely <3
<twilight_sprinkle> *was
<Ryunosuke> nice wrek
<Jim> I've gotten bamboozled and badazzled so many times, watching this show.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Looks great Wrek :O
<twilight_sprinkle> those laughs sound unnatural
<String_Shredder> PonyGuyRulz: Ew, why did you put a pony in the chat? ponies are GHEY.
<Afflict[phone]> silly spambots
<Buytoast> Horses are forbidden.
<broniezrul732> I like cheese
<Kammerjunk> 'Tis true what they say. "Razzle-dazzle them and they'll never catch wise."
<RDash5000> sup String_Shredder
<Mr_Anybody> tru dat
<String_Shredder> Hi, RDash5000
<Kammerjunk> Question: Is Teller mute, or does he just choose not to talk?
<alexxm> same here Jim and i like it i don't like it when people try to spoil the fun by saying how it's done though
<RDash5000> Kammerjunk: i have the same question
<alexxm> Kammerjunk he and penn talk when they try to figure out how the tricks are done
<Wrek> 05imagine being an illusionist
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Jim> hah!
<Wrek> 05but at the same time an assassin
<Ryunosuke> i think he chooses not to
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Ah, thanks.
<Mr_Anybody> These tricks are really rustling my iron jimmies
<LadyCanary> Kammerjunk: It's part of his act. He chooses not to talk. I think.
<broniezrul732> I wanna be a pegasus when I grow up!
<PonyGuyRulz> Penn and Teller ponies http://goo.gl/f82rZ
<alexxm> Kammerjunk well not talks more whispers in penns ear but still
<Kammerjunk> When I grow up, I wanna go to the Moon!
<Stormy> And Meth
<MirrorImage> put them in blue body paint and they could pass as the Blue Man Group
<Stormy> or
<Ryunosuke> Kammerjunk: why wait?
<Jim> Kammerjunk, Why wait?
<Stormy> maybe he is a spambot
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: He whispers sweet nothings into Penn's ear.
<Mr_Anybody> ewwww g3
<Buytoast> those horses look terrifying
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Dusky> Wrek: you mean like appearing to be a regular user, but being all like "crush, kill, destroy, swag"?
<Jim> Hax!
<CriticKitten> Huh.
<LadyCanary> It floats.
<MethIsSick> no
<Ryunosuke> nice
<Ryunosuke> tome
<CriticKitten> ....and moves on its own
<Kammerjunk> INB4 New Wave.
<Ryunosuke> tom :)
<Jim> That's cool
<PonyGuyRulz> midget
<Jim> uhm
<CriticKitten> o.O
<Mr_Anybody> pff, it's just an invisible oompa loompa in there
<Jim> He's breaking the fabrics of space and time guys, are you seeing this?
<RDash5000> i saw that.
<RDash5000> it was a fake
<RDash5000> OOPS
<LadyCanary> Shush.
<RDash5000> SORRY
<Kammerjunk> I dunno guys. I mean, telekinesis is pretty simple, innit?
<Drew> o.o
<Nyst> trick or no, that's still some great synchronizing.
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: Lol, this indeed could be an 80's music video
<CriticKitten> There's gotta be someone in there. O.o
<MethIsSick> finished streaming
<Panda> There is a reason for the music.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: No, the fabric's too thin.
<Jim> Kammerjunk, Yeah, I do 3 telekinesis every morning before breakfast.
<Mr_Anybody> I WANT THAT BOX!!!
<Panda> That is all I will say.
<LadyCanary> Magical box.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: He'd light up like a dark in the candle.
<Jim> What's in the box?!
<Kammerjunk> ...Or something.
<RaveBrony> Not better than the box that turns itself off tho :3
<Mr_Anybody> just use your.... IMAGINATIOOON!
<SirGanjalf> What's in the booooooooooox?!
<Panda> Jim, there you go.
<CriticKitten> Aha!
<Nyst> girl in the box
<SirGanjalf> oh, a head
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Wait, but that's not a very thick material, shouldn't you be able to see her when it was lit up?
<Jim> Step 1: Cut a hole in the box.
<Mr_Anybody> that's normal
<SirGanjalf> Step 2: Put a girl in that box
<LadyCanary> But.
<Mr_Anybody> Step 3: ???
<Kammerjunk> I wonder if the lass' name is Jack.
<Ryunosuke> that looks
<Ryunosuke> light?
<CriticKitten> So I was right so far, girl in the box. But that doesn't explain how it can levitate....
<Kammerjunk> So she'd be Jack in a box.
<MethIsSick> I pressed Back by accident
<LadyCanary> @_@
<MethIsSick> :(
<Buytoast> this is more of a musical routine than a magic act
<twilight_sprinkle> mirrors
<RaveBrony> Well
<MethIsSick> Did I miss anything?
<Jim> dohoho
<prince-dari> Nope
<Jim> It's still very fancy
<Mr_Anybody> very strong string?
<Nyst> Well there is the whole floating bit?
<Afflict[phone]> yes
<MethIsSick> i did?
<otakon> anyone else's stream staggerign?
<twilight_sprinkle> no
<Afflict[phone]> no
<MethIsSick> what did I miss?
<Mr_Anybody> nah
<SirGanjalf> CriticKitten: Oh it's simple; Girl can float
<SirGanjalf> :P
<Stormy> everything
<Kammerjunk> otakon: I'm thinking the weight of all that malware is slowing you down.
<Mr_Anybody> wut the flag
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah i heard backgrounds, and mirrors are a big part of this kind of stuff
<MethIsSick> i did?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!
<Ryunosuke> nice
<Jim> o.o
<CriticKitten> lol
<LadyCanary> Wow.
<otakon> I'm at home Kammerjunk
<SirGanjalf> Wow, they're fast
<MethIsSick> Set the flood limit to 1. I wanna see what will happen
<Nyst> Did the box change colour too?
<Afflict[phone]> we had an intense debate
<RDash5000> sleight of... fashion?
<Jim> Now they ARE breaking the very fabric of space and time.
<Mr_Anybody> my head is esploded
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Oh. I got nothin', then.
<MethIsSick> in the matter of 1 second?
<Stormy> yes
<LooF> Girl in a dress now?
<CriticKitten> To be fair, the girl being in the box was actually predictable by the name: "Cubic Act" does imply three people.
<Wrek> 05ive noticed whenever the box flaots
<Wrek> 05its always on the same axis
<Ryunosuke> RDash5000: the Art of Fashion, as it were?
<RaveBrony> Dun dun dun
<CriticKitten> But the levitation....still haven't caught how they're doing that yet.
<Kammerjunk> I don't know, material that can change colour has been a subject matter for some time now. Maybe they're just scientists.
<RDash5000> Ryunosuke: indeed
<LadyCanary> Wow.
<Mr_Anybody> so very strong fishing wire Wrek ?
<Panda> Wrek, there you go. You figured it out.
<LadyCanary> Not bad, though.
<Afflict[phone]> also we were flooded by bots
<Jim> It's magic, I ain't got to explain shit.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: color wouldnt explain how the lady appeared there
<MethIsSick> lol
<Afflict[phone]> twice
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Oh, she was born in the box. By the box.
<MethIsSick> lol
<SirGanjalf> I bet that pole behind the box had something to do with it
<Nyst> If it'd hide a support structure I'd hide it behind the box, not above it.
<Kammerjunk> She just kinda grew up.
<RaveBrony> Oop
<Stormy> bots that only said "lol"
<Kammerjunk> I have no idea what he just said.
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe she wore something so you could see her on the background
<Mr_Anybody> I was born out of a box, it's common in the states
<MethIsSick> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> *couldnt
<Stormy> they posted so many messages that all of our computers died
<MethIsSick> Wait...
<MethIsSick> Do you mean me?
<CriticKitten> Wow.
<Stormy> so we all bought new ones
<RDash5000> really?
<Stormy> and now here we are
<Stormy> maybe kind of
<Stormy> :P
<Kammerjunk> Well, that's something of a compliment.
<RaveBrony> Dang
<LadyCanary> Wow!
<CriticKitten> Whew.
<SirGanjalf> Woah
<CriticKitten> High praise.
<Jim> That's actually quite a compliment
<RaveBrony> Awww
<alexxm> they know
<Jim> awww
<alexxm> shame the act was good
<CriticKitten> He figured it out, eh? Well he's damn clever then because I'm absolutely baffled.
<Jim> Glad they don't tell US atleast
<Kammerjunk> The only thing the paper said was "BURN THE WIZARDS AND HERETICS"
<RaveBrony> Yeah
*LadyCanary nods
<Kammerjunk> Calling it.
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt pay enough attention to the background but it was pretty dark iirc, someone couldve been there
<Buytoast> impressed they shredded it
<Wrek> 05thign about these tricks is thatnormally
<Wrek> 05if you guessed right
<RaveBrony> THey obviously used pixie dust, its simple
<Wrek> 05they would still tell you no
<Drew> The note said, Leave now and I'll pay you $5,000
<SirGanjalf> There were only three words on that paper: "Magic. Got it."
<RaveBrony> Drew: Hahaha
<Afflict[phone]> my brother: How do you die with insta kill on? *dies*
<Ryunosuke> Finkle is Einhorn, Einhorn is Finkle... EINHORN IS A MAN
<MethIsSick> LOL
<MethIsSick> NOOB
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's half past 3 AM again, so I have to go walk my dog.
<CriticKitten> That was a really good stage act though.
<Mr_Anybody> The note said your fly is down
<Kammerjunk> Because that's what normally goes on at half past 3 AM.
<Jim> Got to love dogs who can't sleep at night
<twilight_sprinkle> they also couldve set up mirrors that block the background but you cant see it so peopel can walk by
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Oh no, she's just like a month old.
<Jim> Ahhh :)
<Mr_Anybody> who wants to go on an african safari?
<Nyst> They never pick guys for this.
<Jim> Oh boy

<CriticKitten> He sounds stumped.
<sub06905> lol
<superretroworld> Bronysith: yolo must be famous atm if a professor knows about it
<Mr_Anybody> he's being really Vauge about this

<MethIsSick> oh
<SirGanjalf> ...what Penn said
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<LadyCanary> WHAT?
<LadyCanary> WOW!
<Jim> To be honest, it was quite a trick
<alexxm> good trick there
<Mr_Anybody> he stalked them before the show :P
<CriticKitten> So was I, honestly. If the audience wasn't planted, then....
<Nyst> Maybe they were in on it?
<CriticKitten> That seems MUCH too random to have guessed with such precision.
<Ryunosuke> I stand by my time lord theory
<Jim> I GOT IT
<Punkie_Pue> Yeah?
<Jim> PSYCIC PAPER
<Drew> Such a hacker man
<twilight_sprinkle> i wasnt paying attention to that one, but i suspect that guy with the long hair is in on it

<CriticKitten> If it wasn't plants, I really don't know. Too many random factors to be that accurate.
<CriticKitten> It just seems impossible. ._.

<Mr_Anybody> i don't care, people are seeing things 2 seconds before i do >:C
<Champion_of_Harmony> for he reminds me of derpy. and anything that reminds me of derpy or any pony gets a free hug.

<Jim> Did he draw a face on the card?
<CriticKitten> This'll be interesting.
<Nyst> He's pretty nervous, but holding together well.
<DaringDerpy> good morning :)
<CriticKitten> "Sure."
<LeGoMeEGGO> AKA cheating
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning DaringDerpy :)
<Mr_Anybody> "sure"
<Jim> Ohai DaringDerpy

<DaringDerpy> burn the witch doctor!
<rdibp> Poker?
<RDash5000> Bronysith: :D
<Jim> To be honest, card tricks are not that impressive anymore
<thelonecubone|GoW3> HI DaringDerpy :)
<CriticKitten> He's really good with his hands here....
<Jim> He's still good though

<Mr_Anybody> lawl
<LeGoMeEGGO> if he did it with short sleeves i'd be impressed
<Ryunosuke> lols
<Jim> Muggles
<CriticKitten> He must have slipped them into his sleeves.
<LeGoMeEGGO> Muggles
<twilight_sprinkle> what amateur magicians sometimes do is they make a card easier to draw than others
<Jim> :D
<Shizuka> 13almost think i need three screens

<Bronysith> Shizuka: can asuka handle it?
<rdibp> is anyone watching The Lion King right now?
<twilight_sprinkle> other than that he has the sleeves to pull them in and out
<CriticKitten> He didn't actually return them to that deck, obviously.
<Barbetos> Shizu welcome to my world

<Shizuka> 13tekkit sucks
<CriticKitten> Pity, it was a good trick.
<LeGoMeEGGO> i don't understand what he actually did that didn't fool them?
<rdibp> whats tekkit?
<Mr_Anybody> the jimmies remain unrustled, for now
<Ryunosuke> oh look flim and flam
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Socks> Oh these guys are epic!
<rdibp> :D
<SirGanjalf> "Just glue some gears to it and call it Steampunk..."
<DaringDerpy> the three emperor year in germany
<CriticKitten> LeGoMeEGGO: That's the thing: they don't reveal how the trick is done to the audience, to keep them mystified.
<Anger> best friends or gay lovers?
<VenHur> More like Flim and Flam...in FANCY MODE!
<SirGanjalf> Gentlemen
<LeGoMeEGGO> Tea? not Cider?
<alexxm> why not both Anger
<Wrek> 05CriticKitten: itsm ore not to ruin the trick for future performances
<Mr_Anybody> british flim and flam
<rdibp> what about cider?
<Anger> good point
<CriticKitten> I sorta followed what he was doing myself, though. But damn he was flawless.
<rdibp> i hate biscuits
<MethIsSick> Im really loving spyro
<Jim> hmm, FTB looks interesting
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Yeah, they don't want to spoil it.
<Socks> I wanted to be a magician when I was younger, but as a dispraxic my skill at sleight of hand can be equatable to that of a bulldozer.
<Ryunosuke> oh dear
<LeGoMeEGGO> TIME TRAVELERS?!?!?
<broniezrul732> I'm glad we watch g4 ponies because G3 BURNS MY EYES!
<rdibp> TIME POLICE
<SirGanjalf> XIX c. magicians. Hopefully things won't escalate like in "Prestige"...
<CriticKitten> And I felt like I knew what he was doing, I just couldn't follow it.
<Socks> This is a great trick
<Jim> I like their moustaches
<Socks> I luv eet :)
<Mr_Anybody> dat picture frame
<CriticKitten> Hrm.
<Nyst> I wonder if the guy standing up is giving him tells.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/9aXvQ.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> that guy could have a tell
<Socks> I think I know how this one is done
<LooF> His fingers
<rdibp> who knew he was thinking of Marie Curie
<Socks> ^^
<rdibp> ^^^
<CriticKitten> The one guy is signaling somehow.
<alexxm> Nyst doesn't seem to be any signals or ear pieces
<DaringDerpy> these hand moves
<Socks> That's what I spotted :P
<Mr_Anybody> giving him some sort of hand signals that only they know, like cathers give to pitchers
<Kandarihu> broniezrul732, just be warned. There's something from G4 that will burn your eyes, too. Keep asking for ponies, and you'll get what you asked for, but not in any way you would ever want it.
<Socks> Didn't see it first time watching
<Nyst> alexxm: he can send the tell when he first picks the card
<otakon> Saturn: you up?
<Shizuka> 13ENDERMAN IN MAH HOUSE ><
<otakon> I don't get it
<CriticKitten> He's signaling somehow.
<MethIsSick> Time to learn to 3d model.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: run
<MethIsSick> So, what should we talk about?
<CriticKitten> I just can't tell how. O.o
<LeGoMeEGGO> they should escalate it somehow...
<otakon> Shizuka: hey can I get your assistance for a moment?
<sub06905> Shizuka, stealin ur blocks?
<Champion_of_Harmony> get in water then look at him.

<Bronysith> Shizuka: indeed, cause then you are either really disapoint at the easiness or amazeed
<butler> fools!
<test> sup
<rdibp> i think Penn's magic comes from his epic ponytail
<Mr_Anybody> that kids jimmies are somwhat rustled to high heaven
<MethIsSick> Your Kimori I bet
<test> No
<Kimori> huh?
<test> I'm Stormy
<MethIsSick> Oh.

<Shizuka> 13there's one i've seen of them where they're moving boxes around and bits of teller keep popping out
<Kimori> hai Stormy!
<Kimori> :D
<LeGoMeEGGO> rdibp: while Teller's comes from his ability to stay stoic
<CriticKitten> I don't mind not knowing how they do it. It really amuses me to watch magic regardless.
<Amu-chan> =P
<test> lol
<test> Hi
<MethIsSick> Wait.
<prince-dari> Stormknight
<Shizuka> 13and it's all hollow inside and he's really working to get from place to place

<Mr_Anybody> OUR JIMMIES ARE ETERNAL
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/uoGRc.jpg
<rdibp> why is everyone talking about jimmies?
<jcelios> the cardinal sin of ttying to figure out magic tricks is to always overcomplicat it
<test> :<
<Jimmies> Because rustling, rdibp
<twilight_sprinkle> we are the jimmy triumverate~
<Kimori> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRmlVEvQO4
<CriticKitten> I think that a simple trick which looks really amazing is the best kind really.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Jimmies: glorious name
<Socks> Penn and Teller have a history of revealing how their tricks are done, pisses off the magic circle but it's really interesting.
<Rustle> :I
<Mr_Anybody> are your jimmies rustled rdibp?
<rdibp> :T
<rdibp> my jimmies never rustle
<jcelios> learning how easy it is to be so amazingly fooled in a really important lesson :)
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Are you sure?
<Mr_Anybody> his jimmies are very rustled
<Jimmies> rdibps jimmies are stone cold
<test> HUH
*Socks russtles his terries :O
<test> blarg, caps
<Mr_Anybody> in fact, his jimmies just shot through the core
<TrixieMuffin> Heres my guess : the "board" is loaded with "nails" the nailgun just makes the sound and has a magnet at the front that pulls up the "nails" . the one he misses is just a blank spot
<Kammerjunk> Socks: That's because the Circle of Magi know what Teller does really is magic.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Because most of my Jimmies do Rustle sometimes
<thelonecubone|GoW3> :P
<Socks> Kammerjunk: True
<test> But I thought mibbit had like a built-in youtube video player thing

<VenHur> Shizuka: Actually, the world is, in modern theories, a rightside-northwest-southeast-two dimensional-one and a half dimensional-rainbow ice cream in a cup planet.

<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/5Cx3t.gif

*Bronysith rustles otakon Jimmies
<Mr_Anybody> he has more balls then my brother
<Jimmies> I should hire him for fixing my cat
<twilight_sprinkle> he could have a pocket in his sleeve that the ball would roll in when you put your arm down
<Stormy> lol dude
<LadyCanary> Huh?
<Stormy> test was me
<CriticKitten> Hrm.
<Stormy> not Kimori
<RDash5000> i saw what happened
<Amu-chan> XP

<MethIsSick> It was Stormy
<prince-dari> Oh

<Stormy> Now I have to test again
<Stormy> D:
<prince-dari> Nah I checked
<prince-dari> I was wrong
<MethIsSick> lol
<prince-dari> Could've sworn it did though
<rdibp> 4
<Stormy> yeah, I thought I remember it being there
<MethIsSick> that's a dope atari collection
<Stormy> It was useful for learning how to ban people
<Amu-chan> That would be silly, since the hostmask is designed to mask IPs.
<prince-dari> Stormy is aspire@888427.5927E3.D25FA5.D37353 * Annie
<prince-dari> Ohai Annie

<Mr_Anybody> jimmies to maximum rustle
<CriticKitten> O.o
<LadyCanary> ....

<Jimmies> Mother of grapefruit!
<Amu-chan> ?
<CriticKitten> That was really good.
<jcelios> good priming XD
<LadyCanary> FUCKING BRILLIANT
<prince-dari> Well we used to use mips, but they're so stupid that they put the stream key in the iframe
<SirGanjalf> The finale was brilliant
<prince-dari> So people can jack your stream
<rdibp> DEN OUTTA DEN
<CriticKitten> The balls vanishing was simple enough, but the oranges popping up out of nowhere?
<Spyrorocks> ahhh
<prince-dari> But we tend to use ustream now, yeah
<LadyCanary> HOW.
<Ryunosuke> HA
<Jimmies> Where the fuck did he keep that large thing?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/a2YBC.jpg "soon..."
<Spyrorocks> I was just investigating earlier what it would take to do 1080p stream.
<LadyCanary> I dont even know.
<Kammerjunk> Jimmies: he he he
<CriticKitten> I am rather clueless how he got the oranges under there.
<rdibp> LadyCanary: magic *snort* *snort*
<Stormy> are you caught up on episodes now dari?
<Nyst> The guy sure knows how to entertain.
<Havok> Bronysith: wat
<Jimmies> Kammerjunk, O U
<prince-dari> Lol, no Stormy
<Spyrorocks> Im not, no spoilers.
<Nyst> It takes talent to insult your audience like that.
<prince-dari> I've seen some S3 eps
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Stormy> you should
<prince-dari> But still haven't watched through the rest of S2
<twilight_sprinkle> you can never really believe when they show you something is empty, because they could just have a mirror in them
<LadyCanary> Yay!
<Spyrorocks> pfffttt
<Stormy> season 3 has been really good
<rdibp> :D
<LadyCanary> Awww.
*LadyCanary applauds.
<prince-dari> I just never feel in the mood to watch it anymore
<CriticKitten> He fooled me, which is enough for me. :P
<Wrek> 05backwith beer and grilled chedar cheese sammiches
<LadyCanary> .....
<Wrek> 05thansk for nothign LadyCanary >:C
<Stormy> Can I spoil stuff that's been revealed from summaries?
<LadyCanary> :(
<sub06905> lol

<prince-dari> INB4 no
<Mr_Anybody> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcm325wx1U1qjw5mao1_1280.jpg
*LadyCanary cries.
<Spyrorocks> we'd need one of these too then. http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/
<Ryunosuke> poor LadyCanary
<Shizuka> 13wrek! you no be mean to canary :<
<rdibp> dat teller
<prince-dari> I don't mind
*Shizuka 13covers canary with a blanket
<Wrek> 05oh dont you sulk i bought you jewelry today
<LadyCanary> And it's my favorite kind of grilled cheese sammich.
<superretroworld> uhhhuu
<LadyCanary> :D
*rdibp steals Canary
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> Conner McCloud?
<rdibp> :O THE DOCTOR
<Stormy> that looks expensive
*LadyCanary jumps on Wrek and smothers him with kissys
*Wrek kisses back~
<CriticKitten> He doesn't really look like a Highlander.
<Wrek> 05and yes
<Stormy> also we need The Hub
<Wrek> 05i have bought her jewelry :|
<Spyrorocks> Intensity Shuttle for USB 3.0 - $199
*LadyCanary blushie
<jcelios> ;)
<Spyrorocks> HDCP ripper, $299
<Kammerjunk> I swear, when I just glanced at him, I thought about Neil Patrick Harris.
<DaringDerpy> sounds interesting
<rdibp> HE'S THE DOCTOR!!!
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Mr_Anybody: YOu just reminded me of someone that rages because he gets killed frequently :D
<jcelios> darling I hope it was FABulous!
<Stormy> would you need both of those things?
<prince-dari> I think some of our streamer can stream in 1080p (from PC not from a capture card), but not all our users have good enough internet to view the stream then
<twilight_sprinkle> daaaahling~
<Spyrorocks> hub - $60
<Mr_Anybody> :3
<Spyrorocks> yes
<Kammerjunk> Maybe it was the chin.
<prince-dari> streamers*
<Jimmies> Chin-boy
<Spyrorocks> thats because ustream has shitty CDN
<Wrek> 05i should stream highlander someday
<Stormy> well I was going to say $200 isn't that bad
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<rdibp> am i the only one getting major lag?
<jcelios> heeeeeeeeeeeeere we are
<Stormy> but I don't know about $500
<jcelios> BORN TO BE KING
<Spyrorocks> I dont know if they have POPs in europe.
<Stormy> that's kind of ridiculous
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Which one? :P
<Spyrorocks> well its equipment you only need to buy once.
<prince-dari> No idea what a POP is
<jcelios> there is only one
<rdibp> he sort of looks like David Tennent...or is it just me?
<twilight_sprinkle> beulsheet
<Wrek> 05the one with queen soundtrack
<Spyrorocks> point of presence
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/toVtQ.jpg
<Jimmies> I like that last one
<Shizuka> 13boolshit, the result of an if statement gone wrong
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: That's probably the Scottis.h
<Kammerjunk> Scottish.*
<CriticKitten> Wrek: OH GOD PLEASE NO
<jcelios> Shizuka: XD
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari, you havent gotten in shit for streaming a pay tv channel yet have you>
<prince-dari> Nope
<Wrek> 05CriticKitten: ikr?
<Stormy> I don't think they care, do they?
<prince-dari> We even had a VA from the show on just after we live streamed a new MLP ep
<Wrek> 05it still goes on early sunday mornign TV here
<Stormy> they only take stuff down when they have to
<rdibp> OMG! THEY PICKED KENNY
<Wrek> 05like 4 or 5 in the morning
<Shizuka> 13Kammerjunk doesn't realize he chained off my programming pun :)
<SirGanjalf> Degree in bullshit really helps in magician career
<CriticKitten> They still put that THING on television?
<Mr_Anybody> KENNY I LOVE YOU KENNY
<ShadowDude> is he going to die?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/6K1oz.jpg
<Jimmies> rdibp, You bastard!
<Spyrorocks> well we will stream the commercials too so they cant get mad :P
<Amu-chan> Depends on who, if it's a Viacom network, look out.
<Stormy> ugh, viacom
<rdibp> KENNY! WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE WALKING DEA
<rdibp> DEAD*
<Stormy> yeah, they're pretty awful
<Wrek> 05same channel has the first knight rider
<Wrek> 05old superman
<Wrek> 05magnum
<Spyrorocks> viacom rules with an iron fist.
<Wrek> 05what else...
<Wrek> 05ah yes renegade
*CriticKitten snickers
<prince-dari> Had to check the name because I coudn't remember who it was
<Spyrorocks> I can pretty much say for certain the output from hdmi on a set top box for HD on the hub will have HDCP embedded.
<prince-dari> We had Andrea Libman
<prince-dari> She voices Pinkie and Fluttershy
<Stormy> o.o
<Stormy> cool
<Shizuka> 13magic
<superretroworld> he looks like quinten taratino
<Spyrorocks> doesnt she live in vancouver>?
<prince-dari> Dunno
<twilight_sprinkle> lel
<SirGanjalf> HOUSEy
<Havok> lol
<LadyCanary> Oh dear.
<CriticKitten> Uh oh.
<Invoker> lol
<Spyrorocks> theres no way you can use a capture card like the intensity pro without stripping the HDCP out of it, which is why you need that other device.
<twilight_sprinkle> of course
<CriticKitten> XD
<Jimmies> O_O
<rdibp> :O:O:O:O:O
<LadyCanary> He's a brick. HOUSE
<RDash5000> wow.
<Invoker> mind=blown
<CriticKitten> Alright, that's pretty nice.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/2tDiw.jpg
<Havok> xD
<rdibp> i knew he was going to do that
<Jimmies> Well
<rdibp> O_O
<CriticKitten> ....okay.
<Drew> wut
<CriticKitten> That was nifty.
<Jimmies> Bricks have officialy been shat
<DaringDerpy> he is a witch!
<Spyrorocks> Then, with a proper cdn for video delivery, you could stream in 1080p/720p/480i on the cheap. stream would adapt to whatever the user is using.
<superretroworld> so what show is this?
<rdibp> BURN THE WITCH
<Panda> BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
<twilight_sprinkle> well if he says so
<Havok> PONIES
<Ryunosuke> that rarity
<jcelios> this show is photoshop!
<ShadowDude> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8860/
<Mr_Anybody> Jimmies: YOU HAVE BEEN R-R-R-R-RUSTLED!!
<Drew> yay
<LadyCanary> I see a Rarity ;D
<jcelios> I can see the UI!
<SirGanjalf> WITCHCRAFT
<Champion_of_Harmony> Damn...
<Jimmies> Mr_Anybody, Verily
<prince-dari> Hmm
<CriticKitten> Rarity~
<Kammerjunk> Ooh, Rarity's coming along. Seriously though, sleep every once in a while, Wrek.
<Spyrorocks> about a penny a user per hour I would think.
<rdibp> BURN RARITY
<ShadowDude> no
<rdibp> BURN EVERYPONY
<Kammerjunk> I mean really, it's half past 4 AM, go to bread.
<Panda> rdibp, i will kill you.
<Stormy> how many users?
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari, how many viewers do you get at once on all streams
<rdibp> burn everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Mr_Anybody> going to bread?
<superretroworld> Kammerjunk: maybe he was so inspired by applebuck season
<Mr_Anybody> ok then
<Spyrorocks> It would support as many users as you throw at it.
*Mr_Anybody dives into bread
<Spyrorocks> just pay for bandwidth.
<ekips> damnit, It was 9 pm, then I began watching a new anime, now its 4:30 am
<Spyrorocks> thats how a cdn works.
<rdibp> he sort of looks like kenny from the walking dead
<prince-dari> The most we get is on pony eps, which is around 5000+
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/xIsI4.jpg if you laugh you are going to hell...nah
<LadyCanary> Hmm..
<prince-dari> Not sure what our max has been
<Stormy> wow
<prince-dari> Somewhere around 7000 I think
<CriticKitten> Hrm
<CriticKitten> He guided him to the word?
<Stormy> just have everyone donate 10 cents and that would cover all the equipment... :P
<ekips> gotta catch some sleep before New Year...good night everyone
<prince-dari> XD
<Jimmies> Night ekips
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah that is common though i didnt see how he guided him
<Wrek> 05good thing im never picked
<CriticKitten> Hrm, that's interesting though. How'd he guide him to that specific word....?
<Spyrorocks> I could probably make it work.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye ekips
<prince-dari> We don't take donations, people are scared of C&D
<rdibp> imma stay up ALL NIGHT! >:3
<Wrek> 05id think of a word like invonurability
<Stormy> ohhh, that's a good point
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Night ekips :)
<SirGanjalf> bunneh!
<Mr_Anybody> I would think of pony for the lolz
<Havok> wait
<Havok> OMG YES
<Stormy> they might not like people charging for their content
<Havok> I've seen this before
<SirGanjalf> no wait, that's dog
<Havok> It's neat
<rdibp> hai Havok
<CriticKitten> Wrek: That's because you're not the typical audience member who is easily led. :P
*LadyCanary takes a bite of Wrek's sammich :)
<rdibp> :)
<sub06905> dat suit
<LadyCanary> Doggy!
<MethGotFlu> Hi
<CriticKitten> Puppy :D
<Kammerjunk> Instant stooge principle: Get the person to play along with either a bribe like in a restaurant with the waiter or a blatant asking for helpe like as the person is brought on stage during the clapping acknowledgment.
<Wrek> 05am i goign to have to smack a bitch? :o
<MethGotFlu> Internet messed up

<MethGotFlu> lol
<Amu-chan> Do you actually have the flu, or are you just using "flu" because it sounds more interesting than a "cold"?
<Stormy> close enough
<Stormy> right?
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> Get out
*rdibp blows LadyCanary's mind
<prince-dari> :P
<VenHur> WREK

<rdibp> hai Petrified_Discord
<Spyrorocks> yeah it works out to about a cent a user to watch 1080p for 23 minutes.
<rdibp> :)
<Kammerjunk> Teller's looking kind of not indifferent.
<prince-dari> Damn
<prince-dari> Wow
<Kammerjunk> Must be big.
<Jimmies> Less clothing, more dancing!
<ShadowDude> WAT
<Petrified_Discord> I've seen this a couple times...still no idea how they do it
<Kandarihu> 2mbps... that's bad by Swedish standards, isn't it?
<CriticKitten> ....quick changer.
<rdibp> Teller is the not known giver of fucks
<MethGotFlu> wow
<VenHur> ...Wrek can't have MY sandwich. I structered after the learning tower of pizza.
<Havok> Kandarihu: Somewhat bad
<Spyrorocks> which actually adds up.
<Kammerjunk> Dat Queen cover.
<Wrek> 05depends
<Nyst> every outfit gets smaller and smaller
<prince-dari> Yeah
<Nyst> for both of them
<rdibp> lawlwut

<Wrek> 05how many are watchign stream?
<MethGotFlu> wow
<Spyrorocks> bandwidth isnt cheap.
<Jimmies> 69
<Stormy> heh
<Mr_Anybody> lawl
<rdibp> Wrek: its laggin like crazy
<Wrek> 05also my internet supports 100mbps up
<Spyrorocks> thats actually cheaper bandwidth than amazon ec2
<LadyCanary> Not lagging at all for me.
<Nyst> stream is fine for me.
<CriticKitten> I'm getting zero lag. >_>
<Kammerjunk> Not lagging for me either.
<Ryunosuke> not lagging here
<Spyrorocks> whcih is $0.05 a gb if i remember right
<rdibp> for me it is ;_;
<Wrek> 05it uploading at 2mbps means theres jsut that much data going up
<Shizuka> 1369 on now
<Petrified_Discord> No lag over here :)
<Stormy> what if we threw some ads on the page
<RDash5000> zero lag
<Champion_of_Harmony> Man I love bronystate....
<VenHur> 986 and 148.
<Stormy> would that cover it?
<Wrek> 05then to recieve that you need a cosntant flow of 2mb down
<superretroworld> im getting lag
<SirGanjalf> no lag here
<Mr_Anybody> fer me it's lagin like crzy, is it because I'm a murican? :(
<rdibp> dat face :D
<Spyrorocks> Just maybe a refferal link to welovefine or some other pony merch site.
<superretroworld> Mr_Anybody: murican?
<Spyrorocks> make some comission.
<Wrek> 05take it over a giant distance
<jcelios> im on god awful canadian internet, zero lag
<Mr_Anybody> 'Murica
<Nyst> Their act is cute but it's just one trick over and over.
<Wrek> 05so yes there might be some huge lag if youre on a bad connection i
<MethGotFlu> lol
<superretroworld> never heard of that place
<CriticKitten> Hrm, okay that last one sorta threw out my theory.
<Jimmies> that's a pretty dress
<DaringDerpy> they have variations in it
<CriticKitten> o.O
<sub06905> suddenly this song
<Mr_Anybody> it's america super, get with the program
<LadyCanary> ...Hm.
<Ryunosuke> Jimmies is rustled
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Kammerjunk> I don't get it. My Internet connection supports 15 Mbps up but 50 down.
<CriticKitten> That one was even better.
<Mr_Anybody> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcm325wx1U1qjw5mao1_1280.jpg
<Jimmies> Ryunosuke, every day
<Nyst> the skirt part of the dress could be folded up over the chest.
<Spyrorocks> let me calculate 720p
<superretroworld> burn
<sub06905> lol
<DaringDerpy> true
<Stormy> what does bronystate do again?
<Stormy> is it 720?
<superretroworld> are these contests?
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<DaringDerpy> kinda
<MethGotFlu> bronystate?
<Wrek> 05the ones that manage to fool penn n teller with their magic act
<CriticKitten> Tear-away clothing.
<Stormy> I'd look up at my logs
<Wrek> 05gets to play at their las vegas stage
*CriticKitten nods.
<LadyCanary> Lovely act, though.
<prince-dari> I'd have to ask the ep streamer
<CriticKitten> Did make a nice performance though.
<Stormy> but the window got cleared after I parted :P
<CriticKitten> And they disguised the removal well.
<prince-dari> We all stream at different bitrates
<Spyrorocks> 720 is about 40% cheaper
<Wrek> 05omg these eps are 50 minute each
<Spyrorocks> BUT remember this
<Wrek> 05with no commercial
<Havok> .-.
<Kammerjunk> Well, razzle dazzle them and they'll never catch wise.
<CriticKitten> O.o
<Spyrorocks> I can make it also support streaming to ipad/iphone/android which is nice
<Petrified_Discord> Kammerjunk: ^
<jcelios> benefits of bronystate TV :)
<CriticKitten> Nice.
<Spyrorocks> in the web browser
<Ryunosuke> oh these guys
<Stormy> are you serious about doing this?
<MethGotFlu> are you talking about livestreaming?
<Spyrorocks> Maybe
<Mr_Anybody> so they were wearing clothes under their clothes and were wearing rip away clothing?
<Havok> Stockgolm Sweden
<Stormy> because it would be pretty awesome
<Havok> And
<Ryunosuke> swedes
<Jimmies> GO SWEDEN!

<Jimmies> WOO
<Havok> First time i've seen em
<Havok> xD
<CriticKitten> Mr_Anybody: That's what it seems.
<Wrek> 05id say go homeland!
<Petrified_Discord> "Very well known in Sweden." "By who?"
<Stormy> but I don't exactly have that kind of money. XD
<Wrek> 05but
<superretroworld> Havok: have you seen this ep before?
<Wrek> 05i dont knwo these guys
<Havok> ^
<SirGanjalf> Brogicians
<Spyrorocks> But it sucks I dont have the hub here at home so I could actually have my equipment here instead of shipping it to someone and having to troubleshoot and set up remotely.
<prince-dari> If you can get a post on EQD you should get a fairly good number of viewrs
<prince-dari> viewers*
<Mr_Anybody> dat hair
<Kammerjunk> I swear, people in Denmark have such strange strange views on the rest of the world. Hell, it's common belief here that Swedish people have hilariously silly accents, but really, they're just less retarded version of Danish accents.
<Havok> xD
<Spyrorocks> and Im not sure if I will cover my costs.
<the_real_pony_1604> and what are we watching?
<Stormy> No one currently streams 1080p, do they?
<CriticKitten> ....
<LadyCanary> O_O
<SirGanjalf> yay, duct tape
<Bronysith> ouch
<RDash5000> OH NO
<prince-dari> I dunno, probably not
<Spyrorocks> if they do then theres no point in me doing it
<Bronysith> duct tape <3
<LadyCanary> Ow.
<Nyst> Well, I hope he didn't need those eyebrows.
<soulrider95> thats gonna hurt
<Invoker> :I
<Jimmies> This is completely normal in Sweden, don't worry.
<CriticKitten> ....ow.
<Stormy> that would get some attention if you're the only one doing it
<SirGanjalf> yes it is:D
<DaringDerpy> so far it is entertaining
<Spyrorocks> I like the idea of streaming to mobile devices.
<MethGotFlu> Noone streams 1080p right now.
<CriticKitten> That's gonna hurt like fucking hell to remove.
<Stormy> I'd say it would be EQD worthy
<Petrified_Discord> No, the entertainment comes when that long hair comes the hell out of his head :D
<MethGotFlu> At least, as far as Twitch.tv is concerned.
<CriticKitten> He had facial hair and everything.
<Mr_Anybody> lawl, looks like a public execution
<Kencolt> The... I take a nap and THIS is what's on...
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Havok> xD
<Shizuka> 13for a..fffarm

<Petrified_Discord> XD
<Christian_Carter> Why is it quiet again?
<Kammerjunk> Eh, part of the trick.
<rdibp> alright guys, im back. i had to reset my computer. :)
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, you would need 8-10mbps upload bandwidth at home though.
<Jimmies> Christian_Carter, Watching card trick
<CriticKitten> XD
<Petrified_Discord> So much suspense!
<jcelios> it'll be in his mouth or something XD
<prince-dari> Hm
<Stormy> I'm pretty sure I get 8mbps
<Christian_Carter> To Everyone That Dosen't Know Me, I Just Became A Brony Yesterday
<Spyrorocks> and probably a decent computer, although stream is automatically transcoded at cdn
<CriticKitten> Ah.
<prince-dari> Upload?
<MethGotFlu> Why not just get a wired connection?
<rdibp> :O
<Spyrorocks> www.speedtest.net
<prince-dari> Dayum
<Ryunosuke> wut?

<CriticKitten> That was sneaky.
<Spyrorocks> MethGotFlu, why not stop being retarded?
<Drew> wtf?
<Stormy> not here, I don't know about here
<Christian_Carter> No, I'm Not Ready
<jcelios> when he's smacking him

<Jimmies> hahahaa
<LadyCanary> He's like fuck this. xD
<Ryunosuke> ouch

<Mr_Anybody> D:<
<Invoker> oh god
<Invoker> ew
<rdibp> ded?
<Stormy> but I pay for 5mbps for my apartment
<Kammerjunk> Christian_Carter: Well, in case you haven't been told, welcome to the BronyState mental asylum! Please leave your sanity in the designated disposal bin and proceed for your strait jacket.
<Petrified_Discord> In his face?
<Stormy> and supposedly we're actually getting 8
<Spyrorocks> up or down
<rdibp> :D
<Petrified_Discord> YUP
<prince-dari> My upload is only 2
<Stormy> um
<Stormy> not sure
<SirGanjalf> Is this the illusionist version of Jackass?
<Shizuka> 13he swapped them out
<Spyrorocks> my upload is 0.3mbps
<Nyst> yeah I saw that too
<rdibp> lolnope
<prince-dari> Wow
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Kammerjunk: hey, thats what i did when derpyMuffins went sane
<Shizuka> 13very end it's in his pocket
*Invoker claps
<Spyrorocks> my phone has better internet connection than my home.
<superretroworld> bullshit, they probaly had two cards
<Kammerjunk> thelonecubone|GoW3: What is this 'sane' thou speakest of?
<prince-dari> LOL
<DaringDerpy> too obvious
<MethGotFlu> lol
<Java> I saw that too
<Drew> Yeah
<Stormy> lol
<Nyst> the card dissapeared behind his hand for a second after he took it out.
<Petrified_Discord> Staple gun bit earns them some points :)
<Shizuka> 13the open hand is always the giveaway
<Stormy> you used to have dialup though :P
<Kencolt> Sure, it's a swap-- but it's a HELL of a swap.
<Stormy> I remember that
<Spyrorocks> But once we move my store location im getting the 250mbps down/15mbps up business package.
<rdibp> you might have fooled all of bronystate, but you cant fool me! i listen to public radio.
<Stormy> because we couldn't play Mario Kart :P
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Kammerjunk: where people act this so called "normal"
<Spyrorocks> I had dialup up until like 3 years ago.
<MethGotFlu> lol
<Barbetos> duct tape, the manly way to shave.
<Java> just do it bald
<Jimmies> Manliest way to shave: An axe.
<Kammerjunk> thelonecubone|GoW3: Normal? Normal... Eh, sounds delicious!
<prince-dari> I know lots of people in America have been salivating about this: https://fiber.google.com/about/
<Spyrorocks> Id probably also have to get you a little desktop to dedicate to stream transcode and upload...
<Mr_Anybody> Manliest way to shave, Legos
<Kammerjunk> I'll have one of that!
<Java> no need, just use a shaving knive. It's manly enough
<Spyrorocks> yeah google fiber is cool.
<MethGotFlu> is 16.24 Up/1.54 Up any good?
<MethGotFlu> The first one is down
<rdibp> i use a lightsaber to shave
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Aye, It does when it was often to find one
<Panda> Manliest way to shave. Tweezers?
<Spyrorocks> seems average.
<rdibp> BUSTED
<MethGotFlu> oh
<Christian_Carter> I Was AFK, Sorry
<Christian_Carter> BRB
<Spyrorocks> for equipment itwould probably cost around $800-$1k.
<MethGotFlu> I wanna have better internet.
<Nyst> welp.

<DaringDerpy> there had to be a switch
<Java> Is it somekind of trick
<LadyCanary> Shizu, mind blown? :3
<Spyrorocks> it adds up.
<Jimmies> Swedes don't lie, their story checks out
<LadyCanary> YAY!
<MirrorImage> i bet there was a switch with the scissor handoff
<Kammerjunk> I have the feeling Penn and Teller have a private conversation with everyone who won after the show.
<Petrified_Discord> Wait what?
<Stormy> lol, that speed test is taking forever to even start on this laptop
<Petrified_Discord> It wasn't a switch :O
<Shizuka> 13i think they just lied about the switch..
<prince-dari> XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> evening everyone
<rdibp> MY FREAKING THING LAGGED AND I COULDNT HEAR THE TRICK :[:[:[
<Drew> Yep, they are LIERS
<Java> Pen And Teller know they switch, but their performance is too good. But they lie.
<Jimmies> Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Stormy> "selecting best server based on ping"
<Panda> Liars*
<sub06905> ello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Mr_Anybody> Swedens don't lie, It's a universal fact
<Jimmies> ^
<CriticKitten> Here's my guess: the slap was the exchange point.
<Shizuka> 13it's on the floor
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<rdibp> P
<Panda> The middle .
<Barbetos> The ball never exsisted!

<Wrek> 05swedes cracked enigma 2 years before the switch
<RoboGerbil> the cake is a lie
<Barbetos> The ball. Is. A. Lie.
<Panda> The balls are in your mouth.
<Petrified_Discord> It's in A, B, and C
<Panda> Kidding.

<LadyCanary> Heehee
<Mr_Anybody> the balls are in my pelvis
<Stallion_of_War> I don't know about that... Notch always says that stuff can't be done in Minecraft and then someone makes a mod for it Mr_Anybody...
<superretroworld> Petrified_Discord: in other words, it can either be in a b or c
<CriticKitten> When the guy slapped him in the head, he quickly grabbed the back of his head and rubbed it hard. I think that's when they passed the card.
<Wrek> 05Stallion_of_War: notch is a cheap fuck
<Stormy> and now it locked up my browser
*Invoker choose b
<Stormy> so sad
<Stormy> :P

<CriticKitten> Teller has his pen out, though, I think Teller has an idea.
<rdibp> Teller: not bad
*Deacon claps because cool
<MethGotFlu> ...
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> He got balls to do that with other magician
<MethGotFlu> hi afflict[phone]

<rdibp> is TELLER TALKING!?!?!?! a:O
<MethGotFlu> hi stormy
<Java> By taking Penn to the stage he reduce the chance two magicians notice his trick.
<Kimori> ?
<MethGotFlu> hi prince-dari
<Kammerjunk> The only one Teller talks to is Penn. He whispers sweet nothing in Penn's ear.
<Ryunosuke> ha
<CriticKitten> I'm still amazed he slipped a wrapped deck of cards in between his hands.
<Deacon> JRP2234 XD
<MethGotFlu> did u grab MineCraft
<Stormy> uh
<Stormy> hi?
<CriticKitten> Without him catching it.
<Jim> Kammerjunk, How romantic of him
<MethGotFlu> lol
<Kammerjunk> Jim: It's because Penn is His chosen prophet.
<rdibp> YAY
<Nyst> So they saw the trick beforehand?
<Jim> :D
<Amu-chan> Highlight spam much?
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Told ya
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: Only part of it.
<CriticKitten> So they caught the deck switch, but not the card.
<rdibp> YES
<Deacon> that guy is the master magician, penn admitted it
<Kammerjunk> The best part is left undiscovered.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Off to Vegas with you!
<LadyCanary> Hoho.
<rdibp> TAKE MAI MONEH
<Java> That's ballsy enough to bring Penn up close too.
<Stormy> Meth does this all the time
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Jaysus!
<Jim> Shut up and take my magic!
<Java> but he thought he can do that
<Stormy> I have an idea
<MethGotFlu> Yea?
<Kammerjunk> Okay, yeah, that was really impressive.
<Kencolt> It's basically. 'We know everything you did! Everything! except... the important bit."
<Stormy> when you spam like that we should just not say anything
<CriticKitten> Yeah, the card swap is what baffles me.
<MethGotFlu> yeah
<Stormy> so then you will have to come up with an actual conversation topic
<Stormy> :P
<rdibp> dat ;)
<Ryunosuke> swag
<Deacon> ah cubar
<MethGotFlu> So, what is yoru favorite game ever?

<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Well, they both saw that, probably happened when he was talking about the tricks he could do.
<Panda> hm... Scarface?

<twilight_sprinkle> nah he just seems liek a comedian :D
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> I believe you have my stapler.
<MethGotFlu> I saw Iron Maiden in concert, pretty cool.
<Stormy> kind of a guilty pleasure
<RDash5000> not really getting anything here
<Ryunosuke> hhahaa
<RoboGerbil> theyre all loaded but they have safeties
<Kammerjunk> Hah, parental guidance.
<rdibp> cuban staplette

<Shizuka> 13russian roulette doesn't seem much like a magic trick as it is having safeties
<LadyCanary> Shizuka: My name i-i-s Milton Waddams and th-they took my stapler.
<MethGotFlu> what is jpop?
<prince-dari> Japanese Pop
<Kencolt> Wrpng messgaes all over-- and I can see so many ways it can be done unless...

<Shizuka> 13thicker coaster
*Sumica yawns

<Nyst> russian roulette isn't about probabilities or chance, it's about how stupid you are to play any kind of game with a weapon, especially a loaded one.
<rdibp> prepuh tu duuuuur
<LadyCanary> Sumi! :3
<Christian_Carter> I'm Back!
<Deacon> yo Christian_Carter

<Christian_Carter> I might be AFK again

<Stormy> oh it's okay
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, arrows get lost like you don't even know.
<Bronysith> Barbetos: ill help you not be bored
<prince-dari> Well she started to go by Mikey
<rdibp> RIP teddy bear ;_;
<Stormy> names ending with o tend to be male
<prince-dari> So you'd be forgiven for making the mistake
<prince-dari> :P
<twilight_sprinkle> wonder if those are real
<Barbetos> It must be the.. bored... wood? HA
<MethGotFlu> I realized that there is much less guys in the Spyro Community, so I should just call everyone I dont know, a girl.
<Champion_of_Harmony> hmm the gun was amrked thats why he placed it to the side
<DaringDerpy> staple guns are not the best medium for a magic trick
<Barbetos> Okay that was dum
<Punkie_Pue> Is there a special way to fire the stapler?
<Kencolt> So... He forced a stapler. Not a card. Not a coin. A STAPLER. That is impressive.
<Stormy> and she has her gender on the forum set to male
<Java> Nice performance but boring.
<LadyCanary> Very nice.
<MethGotFlu> lol
<Kimori> why?
<Drew> I didn't like it
<Kimori> Meth: thats a good idea
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :D
<DaringDerpy> I hoped he will come up with a surprise at the end
<MethGotFlu> yup :p
<LadyCanary> HA
<LadyCanary> XD
<sub06905> lol
<Java> he stretch it a little bit too much.
<Stormy> to throw off the anonymous trolls from years ago I think
<prince-dari> I'm blatantly a girl
<rdibp> XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD
<Kimori> I have to admit....it is rare to have a chat room with girls
<Stormy> LOL dari
<Barbetos> I have no idea what was going on really
<CriticKitten> He's got a way to tell which one's loaded.
<Quick_Thinker> ughhhh hello bronystate
<Jim> hi Quick_Thinker
<Deacon> hey Quick_Thinker!
<Stormy> there are no girls on the internet
<Java> hello Quick_Thinker
<Kimori> and in this case the girls run the chat room :P
<Quick_Thinker> Dark souls is getting to difficult :l
<Stormy> duh
<Stormy> :P
<rdibp> Barbetos: cuban rollette
<Barbetos> NEVER!!
<Shizuka> 13yeah i think you could easily have a tell on the loaded stapler and just modify the trick realtime
<Phase4> i'm closer to 2013 than most of you :P
<Kimori> muhahahhaa
<Everto> Hey
<Afflict[phone]> hey Everto

<Kimori> :o
<Stormy> lolololol
<Kimori> don't do that
<Stormy> aw
<God> Die SATAN
<Quick_Thinker> i just thought of something buytoast is like the yahtzee of bronystate
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, I had an idea to piss people off. 1080p pony stream, at random times the stream stops and you have to enter a captcha to continue.
*God kills satan
<Meth> Sorry, he's not here
<God> LOL Spyrorocks
<Deacon> really now?
<God> FUUUUUUU
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> you would be so hated
<Buytoast> i'm the what?
<God> Thanks Kimori
<Spyrorocks> But loved at the same time for 1080p./
<princess-dairy> Nah, you need to cut to G3.5 halfway through the ep
<LeGoMeEGGO> so much yelling
<rdibp> :[
<Jim> Teller is the voice actor for Gordon Freeman.
<Quick_Thinker> yahtzee zero puncuation from the escapist magiziene
<thelonecubone|GoW3> this game where you put dice in a cu[
<Stormy> if you enter the captcha wrong
<thelonecubone|GoW3> cup*
<Stormy> and you only get one chance
<Meth> Question...
<Drew> Because you lied!
<God> LOL
<the_real_pony_1604> don't trust the friench
<Anger> lies
<rdibp> Jim: real original
<LadyCanary> Good for him
<Meth> How difficult would it be to p2p stream a movie?
<Wrek> 05really hate that steam canceled ep3 though
<Deacon> Jim also the VA for plank and Tom
<Stormy> okay this is confusing without my usual colored nicklist
<God> /whois meth
<Spyrorocks> if you enter it wrong it starts playing from the beginning.
<Barbetos> Trust your france. Not the friends.
<Kammerjunk> If you don't speak their crazy moon language, don't trust them
<God> I am Meth.
<Barbetos> er.. I mean.. oh watevr.
<Buytoast> aint that the thing with the little stick figure guy with the hat and tie?
<God> meth is everto
<Kimori> Meth change your nick
<Java> Wrek: I see what you did there XD
<CriticKitten> I'm guessing they have to reveal the nature of their trick after the show to verify it.
<rdibp> Deacon: also Gummy :3
<God> I am God.
<Drew> XD
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<God> Meth is Everto

<Kimori> Change it to Everto
<twilight_sprinkle> bye GilDash
<Meth> Wait, that meth, or me?
<Stormy> impersonating = bad
<rdibp> bai GilDash /)
<Panda> GilDash, try for 24 hours some other time.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Night GilDash :)
<Kimori> do not impersonate
<God> how do I change my nick faster?
<MissVenom> Greetings Everypony
<God> without leaving?
<Everto> You can't
<Eddmario> So, I FINALLY got around to starting the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim today...
<GilDash> Panda: 48 and willing to try 96 someday.
<Jim> hai MissVenom
<Everto> It's a special ability
<God> yes u can
<Kimori> ...
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Hi MissVenom

<Deacon> lali-ho MissVenom
<Quick_Thinker> its so classified ITS ON A FILE WITH THE WORDS ON IT like some 50's spy movie
<God> oh
<Stormy> RDX and I impersonated each other once
<princess-dairy> You have to buy Spyrochat gold
<Everto> Given to only the highest of the order
<Stormy> that was fun
<rdibp> FAAAAAAAAAKE
<Panda> GilDash, been there done that. It is not fun to be an insomniac.
<Barbetos> he is gona burn paper in a vacuum
<Eddmario> Has Teller EVER talked?
<Stormy> we just made fun of each other
<rdibp> Eddmario: nevar
<Stormy> and no one even caught on
<LadyCanary> O_O
<Afflict[phone]> spyrochat gold = $15 a month
<Deacon> Eddmario not on camera maybe
<Phase4> my client claims that someone pinged me
<Everto> So back to my question
<Quick_Thinker> grab a random ponce
*Phase4 is unable to locate this ping
<Buytoast> man, this reminds me of that time i won a years supply of lo'real kids shampoo from a rugrat's play
<Stormy> payable to me of course
<rdibp> he didnt even show a number
<Barbetos> he grabed his best france
<Everto> Can you peer to peer stream a movie?
<Buytoast> cause i had the winning ticket under my seat
<rdibp> NAAAAAAAAAIL
<Java> I think Penn and Teller also review their showmanship skill.
<Eddmario> Who here has played the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim?
<CrystalPhoenix> is it wrong to be upset by some drawing that feature someone holding a violin with the right hand?
<Quick_Thinker> i've got a golden ticket
<superretroworld> i like his hair
<Stormy> btw, God, it's /nick to change your name
<Everto> Damnit Stormy
<Jim> CrystalPhoenix, Maybe they're left handed?
<Java> CrystalPhoenix: What if the violinist is left handed?
<rdibp> i leik his mane :3
<Barbetos> is this guy a magician or a mathmatician?
<Stormy> :P
<Barbetos> So many numbers
<Stormy> I felt bad leaving him out
<Barbetos> Twilight is turned on somewhere right now becuase of this guy.
<Stormy> just don't make me regret this :P
<Everto> Well
*Jmo slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Meth> thx
<rdibp> what is this place, filled with so many numbers
<the_real_pony_1604> this guy wears his sunglasses at night
<CrystalPhoenix> I've never seen a violinist holding the violin with his right hand
<LooF> The black guys hands are a different colour to his face
<CrystalPhoenix> never ever ever
<rdibp> sukker
<Quick_Thinker> im not a fuckin mathmatican or a checkbook your on your own
<Java> Some people play play guitar differently too.
<Stormy> don't change your name every 5 seconds or anything
<Stormy> or we will have problems
<Spyrorocks> princess-dairy, what countries are most bronystate people from
<Meth> ok
<Buytoast> Chicago is the greatest destination
<Jim> LooF, That is actually very common
<princess-dairy> Viewers?
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Woah, that's a helluva audience participation
<Meth> wait, so is princess-dairy actually a guy?
<Stormy> we can also set a mode that prevents non-ops from changing their nicks
<Meth> or was i right?
<Meth> :o
<LooF> Jim- watch
<Stormy> princess-dairy is a dude
<Java> SirGanjalfTheGreen: Showmanship need variations too.
<Meth> oh
<Quick_Thinker> this guys got a lot of charisma
<Meth> i was wrong lol
<Deacon> wow
<rdibp> :O:O:O:O:O:O:O
<CriticKitten> Hrm.
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<JRP2234> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6824324864/h42D7C563/
<Quick_Thinker> WITCH CRAFT BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
<otakon> Bronysith: dude, sorry had to wander off for something
<Stormy> why would he be prince-dari if he was a girl?
<Spyrorocks> transsexual.
<Stormy> that wouldn't make sense
<CriticKitten> He's doing this all off-stage? This is pretty impressive actually.
<Meth> someone said he was a girl a few days ago
<Barbetos> quit saying my name stream
<Barbetos> ffs
<Stormy> they were probably messing with you
<Quick_Thinker> Barbetos :D
<Meth> why is he a dude if his name is princess-dairy
<Java> Barbetos: why?
<Stormy> he changed it
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: Go to bed, Johnathan
<Stormy> as a joke
<Meth> :o
<Kammerjunk> Or Ross.
<Kammerjunk> Whichever.
<The_Engineer> Barbetos_Jonathon
<Stormy> I used to call him that and he would get mad at me
<Barbetos> It did it again
<rdibp> CriticKitten: thats what he want syou to thinkl
<Meth> oh
<princess-dairy> Majority are probably American SR
<princess-dairy> We get a fair number of Russians as well
<MissVenom> EVIL EVILLLLL....
<Ryunosuke> numbers game?
<twilight_sprinkle> does not seem legit
<rdibp> BURN TEH WITCH
<Shizuka> 13well i dunno about forcing the tshirt but the numbers could just be math
<princess-dairy> And just Europe in general
<Spyrorocks> Ponies live stream, after 5 minutes it tells you to pay $2. :P
<princess-dairy> Lawl
<Quick_Thinker> no first we need to find a duck
<klarinetist> Is that psyhic paper from Doctor Who?
<Ryunosuke> wut?
<Stormy> that's just cruel
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> suddenly Nirvana
<Anger> NIRVANA

<Stormy> it takes long enough to find the episodes as it is
<Jim> whoa
<Buytoast> what
<LadyCanary> .......
<Kammerjunk> Hahaha!
<princess-dairy> I still think you should cut to G3.5 half way through the ep
<Stormy> :P
<rdibp> :o NIRVANA
<Deacon> hmm?
<Kammerjunk> Amazing!
<Drew> WTF
<princess-dairy> So many delicious tears

<LadyCanary> AMAZING
<twilight_sprinkle> lel
<Java> Now that's SHOWMANSHIP!
<Drew> whaaaaaaaaat!
<Kencolt> OK... that was BRILLIANT.
<The_Engineer> WHAT DID I JUST SAY
<MissVenom> i knew he looked sketchy...
<Kammerjunk> And of course, Teller still isn't impressed.
<Shizuka> 13the numbers in the bowl do not match his
<Buytoast> didn't he choose his own destination though?
<twilight_sprinkle> thats a high-quality mask
<Deacon> whoever spotted the hands was on to something
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> nonetheless: MIND = BLOWN
<Champion_of_Harmony> then...all of that was for naught, just a disguise trick....clever yes but...
<rdibp> REPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAY
<Spyrorocks> This infrastructure would allow you to host and stream everything all episodes on demand
<Quick_Thinker> why nirvana
<Spyrorocks> but it might get expensive if you got a lot of traffic
<The_Engineer> I WANT TO REPLAY
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Quick_Thinker> i mean its good but still
<Deacon> Quick_Thinker because 90s
<LooF> haha
<Drew> lol
<Kammerjunk> Wait, wait, wait. The volunteer wasn't the person who decided that he should be the other volunteer.
<Meth> Wait, would you be gaining money if u livestream?
<Jim> Let's have another look on that
<Shizuka> 13ah thus the sunglasses
<rdibp> lawl
<otakon> the hell?
<RaveBrony> Yep
<Shizuka> 13cause the eyes would be a dead giveaway
<Spyrorocks> google must have such a low negotiated interconnect rate with other datacenters.
<otakon> ...
<otakon> WAT!?
<superretroworld> that was fucking clever, but it probaly wasnt live
<Buytoast> PEEEEEELING OOOOOOF MY SKIIIIIIIN
<Java> Mission Impossible trick right there.
<Spyrorocks> for youtube.
<Buytoast> THESE MAAAAGIC TRIIIICKS ARE REEAAAAAL
<rdibp> only 25 hours, 29 minutes till 2013 :3
<Kammerjunk> So the guy with the number just coincidentally chose Leewoy (or whatever) as the second volunteer?
<otakon> Kammerjunk: yeah
<superretroworld> Buytoast: of course there are, there magic tricks :P
<Quick_Thinker> soooooo anyone want to help me kick those 2 bosses ass in Anor Londo in Dark souls
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<Java> Kammerjunk: Penn nonetheless
<rdibp> dun dun dun dun dundun
<Kammerjunk> Java: Well, Penn chose the other guy. That guy then chose Leewoy.
<RaveBrony> :I
<LadyCanary> Teller knoooooows.
<Kammerjunk> LadyCanary: You can tell by his face, eh?
<RaveBrony> Aw daaaamn
<Spyrorocks> Man... with 7000 viewers you would suck 1tb of bandwidth in like a minute.
<Shizuka> 13yep!
<rdibp> BUSTED
<Spyrorocks> sluurrrrppp all gone.
<LadyCanary> Oooh.
<LadyCanary> D:
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> For a moment i thought "This black guy is a fake" but i had no idea it could be him
<Kammerjunk> Bingo!
<Spyrorocks> that is just insulting.
<LadyCanary> Oh!
<LadyCanary> :D
<Meth> nooooooo
<CriticKitten> Nice job, though.
<Deacon> it was a good trick
<Kammerjunk> No wait, those are poker chips.
<Eddmario> So, what are we watching anyway?
<superretroworld> i'd totally agree
<Kammerjunk> Not bingo.
<Buytoast> was an impressive trick though
<Java> so he passed?
<Buytoast> no he failed
<Java> oh
<rdibp> alright, goodnight everypony
<CriticKitten> He did well, but he didn't fool them.
<Buytoast> but he did good
<RaveBrony> Rewindddd
<Meth> Would you really get 7k viewers streaming ponies or helis?
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Nope, didn't fooled them
<Deacon> and more skin peeling
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Jim> huh?
<Spyrorocks> yes.

<Meth> Would you do it all for free, or some partnership thingy?
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Whatthehellception
<Kencolt> It's a hell of a mask-- you have to give him that.
<CriticKitten> That was a fun trick at least.
<otakon> Wrek: um are you skipping or is it my video acting up?
<Spyrorocks> free
<Spyrorocks> no one wants to pay for anything.
<Kammerjunk> Kencolt: If Ross didn't notice it, yeah.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Quick_Thinker> vegas hmmm im a minor soooo unfortunitly vegas sucks for me
<Shizuka> 13actually once he's up there the second time, you notice his face doesn't hardly move
<Java> I hope he got a chance to perform in LV. His showmanship is excellent.
<Kammerjunk> Follow the Queen.
<Deacon> otakon it was such a good disguise
<Kammerjunk> Stalk her.
<Wrek> 05otakon: was replayign a segment

<Shizuka> 13not six feet either
<Buytoast> don't lie Shizuka
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> >_>: What in tarnation he done to that apple?
<Buytoast> Penn would never steer us wrong
<Barbetos> he throws the apple down and make the volunteer pick them up at gun point
<Kammerjunk> Teller is really good at what he does. Pure visual storytelling, it is.
<Quick_Thinker> i want to seem some one shoot them selves in the head and be unscaved
<Barbetos> AMAZING!!
<Kimori_Naptime> thanks
<Afflict[phone]> night
<Java> Applejack's nightmare
<Meth> night
<Meth> dont let the bed bugs bite
<Java> no one commenting, so tende
<Deacon> the tension!
<Java> tense
<LadyCanary> The sound of silence.
<Quick_Thinker> nom
<Everto> Let them bite
<CriticKitten> ._.
<Ryunosuke> O_O
<Jim> nomnomnom
<RaveBrony> Well
<Everto> It's easier to get rid of them when they think there's a meal
<MissVenom> yum...?
<Kammerjunk> And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Teller doesn't talk.
<Meth> Don't be mean.
<Champion_of_Harmony> O_o
<sub06905> lol
<Shizuka> 13dat grin
<Java> like a frog
<Buytoast> this trick is really a nail biter
<otakon> Kammerjunk: nah he's just a bawss
<Anger> yummy needles
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Bet that must taste... spicy.
<the_real_pony_1604> I have seen this before
<LadyCanary> LORD.
<RDash5000> Buytoast: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<LadyCanary> D:
<Jim> Buytoast, dohoho'
<Java> those nails are cake!
<KrazyNoobs> :O
<Shizuka> 13they're falling into his collar
<CriticKitten> Ugh. ._.
<Quick_Thinker> so okay im a bit dense is teller a mute
<otakon> O_o
<Eddmario> This trick is kinda hard to swallow...
<Everto> If you're trying to exterminate bed bugs, do not stop sleeping in your bed
<the_real_pony_1604> eats the thread, pulls it out and will have all the needles on it
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: nah it's an act
<Ryunosuke> this trick will have you sitting on pins and needles
<Shizuka> 13Quick_Thinker: no just doesn't really talk to people other than penn
<Everto> It may sound weird, but it's the best way to kill them
<Java> Eddmario: We need to digest it slowly
<The_Engineer> are those spikes even real?
<Deacon> I don't see the point of this trick
<Stormy> but who wants to sleep with bugs in their bed? D:
<Meth> Yep
<Kammerjunk> Which I think in itself is amazing.
<Jim> I can't stomach this trick!
<Buytoast> C'mon Teller
<Buytoast> don't choke
<otakon> O_o
<Quick_Thinker> so is like a zenophobic person to everyone but pen
<Everto> Well you can either deal with it for a week
<KrazyNoobs> Jim: AHAAHAA, MY SIDES. AAAAHAHAHAHAHA
<twilight_sprinkle> the trick is, theyre made of crackers!
<Everto> Or wait a month and deal with it for a couple more weeks
<MissVenom> Ad....why?....
<The_Engineer> xD
<Kencolt> This is, in fact, one of the classic illusions-- and no, I don't know how it's done. I've just seen it before. Although, not with as many needdles.
<KrazyNoobs> AAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAHAHAAA
<KrazyNoobs> MissVenom: Adblock
<princess-dairy> Or you could burn the bed and sleep on the floor
<Java> MissVenom: get adblock or ghostery
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Catch some apples!
<Everto> They go into hibernation if they can't find food
<LadyCanary> Be my dentist, sir!
<CriticKitten> xD
<otakon> say "AH"
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :D
<Deacon> ehehe
<Java> awkward
<Quick_Thinker> colgate would be scared
<RaveBrony> Hahahaha
<RDash5000> :D
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: :O, so that's why he didn't di... I mean use it to sew clothes <_<

<LadyCanary> Hehehee
<otakon> Some news on the gaming front
<twilight_sprinkle> hes hiding them in his cavities!
<Barbetos> he just used the greeting of my people!
<otakon> for any that were waiting for the PvP of Diablo 3
<Java> otakon: What is it otakon ?
<Quick_Thinker> what is that news otakon
<Kammerjunk> Well, at least Teller isn't scared of going to the dentist.
<otakon> they canceled it
<Eddmario> Oh god, this is making the flem from my cold/flu/pnumonia bunch up in my throat...
<Meth> Yes! DIE EVERTO!
<Meth> DIE!
<Buytoast> that's old news
<Java> otakon: Not interested
<CriticKitten> ....no
<CriticKitten> No way.
<Kammerjunk> INB4 needles.

<KrazyNoobs> pootis
<RaveBrony> otakon: WUT

<Java> I prefer Torchlight.
<otakon> SANVICH!

<Quick_Thinker> ehhh never played blizard games for a eason dont want to get sucked into them
<Jim> I don't like where this is going
<Barbetos> Okay folks! Thats all!
*Bronysith blends otakon
<Barbetos> Why did you let him eat all that!?
<otakon> RaveBrony: yeah for the time being they cancelled the PvP for Diablo 3
<twilight_sprinkle> is he gonna puke up a sweater?
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Hah, that'd be great.
<Meth> Thanks.

<LadyCanary> .....OH WHAT

<SirGanjalfTheGreen> woah
<Java> oh nonono
<RDash5000> WHAT THE HELL
<Meth> Whattttt?
<Kammerjunk> Teller does not give a single damn.
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: originally the games WEREN'T "always online" bullshit
<Meth> :p :p :p
<Java> I hate needles on mouth
<LadyCanary> The silent master.
<CriticKitten> DEMON MAGIC
<Ryunosuke> now thats a sharp trick
<Deacon> neato
<Stormy> you can still talk with voice
<MissVenom> ....wut .-.
<Stormy> no +m right now
<princess-dairy> Without
<LadyCanary> WE'RE NOT WORTHY
<Spyrorocks> $170 for 10TB of bandwidth
<Stormy> right
<Anger> he had god mode on
<Stormy> withougt
<Spyrorocks> thats a pretty good deal
<Shizuka> 13WITCH
<Stormy> *without
<Spyrorocks> for cdn bandwidth
<Kammerjunk> Teller really does not care. He just kind of sighs, thinking to himself "Really? That's all it takes to impress you lot?"
<Buytoast> and thus, Teller's Mouth of Wonders gave Christmas to the less fortunate for years to follow
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> WITCHCRAFT
<Jim> SCREW THEM, I'M GONNA TRY IT AT HOME
<LadyCanary> Psh. He's always in god mode.
<KrazyNoobs> Dat baby aj
<Drew> he has a pocket in his toung
<CriticKitten> I can't even pretend to know how he did that.
<Java> Suddenly baby applejacl
<CriticKitten> I don't even have the first clue.
<Quick_Thinker> ah shiii its 12 :l
<Champion_of_Harmony> well time for riftraxx
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: As in midnight?

<Eddmario> Hm, I'd make a very lame Star Trek joke using your name here Jim, but I can't think of anything...
<Java> AssertiveFluttershy: hello, just missed some good magic show
<Jim> Eddmario, I'm dead, me.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Well, the fact that he never speaks might help him in that one
<KrazyNoobs> Yay
<KrazyNoobs> This stream is already awesome
<Nyst> That was fun.
<otakon> tahnks for the stream Wrek

<KrazyNoobs> :)
<Kammerjunk> Oh, 720p stream.
<otakon> O_o
<Deacon> ah, the test ep
<CriticKitten> The part that gets me is that he has the guy check his mouth to prove they're not there. So the needles couldn't have gone down his throat to start with. But then where'd he stash them? o.
<Java> suddenly pony
<sub06905> ponies on bronystate?
<CriticKitten> *o.O
<Buytoast> oh, the new horse again?

<AssertiveFluttershy> anything thouse guys can do I can do also
<Deacon> holy carpe diem, 720p
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> newest ep?
<Stormy> heh, there's a gay marriage thread now on spyroforum
<Kammerjunk> Carpe noctem!
<RDash5000> spike has a foot fetish
<Stormy> I feel like that's kind of asking for disaster
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> eeyup
<otakon> ew
<Deacon> PonyGuyRulz really now?
<KrazyNoobs> Dat fluttershy and the dog in the background. (what's applejack's dog's name?
<sub06905> just notied fluttershy walking winona
<Barbetos> loves the smell of dirty feet
<Bronysith> RDash5000: and mane
<Anger> fluttershy walkin aj's dog?
<P0N3> It's pretty gross he gets off on that.
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<otakon> KrazyNoobs: Winona
<PonyGuyRulz> Deacon: Yeah
<Kencolt> Spike has limited list-making skills compared to... you know who.
<Spyrorocks> but since we are kind of low on traffic
<KrazyNoobs> otakon: Aw, thanks
<Stormy> but I'm gonna see where it goes
<Spyrorocks> let it ride.
<Stormy> yeah
<Spyrorocks> :P
<P0N3> I like this episode, because it has Applejack being a badass.
<the_real_pony_1604> considering how little data is actually streaming, I will approve of this quality.
<otakon> damn you buffer and np KrazyNoobs
<Spyrorocks> thats bad of me to say.
<AssertiveFluttershy> My little LAG!
<AssertiveFluttershy> :P
<Barbetos> what the hell?
<PonyGuyRulz> Doctor whooves offical name is Time Turner
<Wrek> 05its a 720p stream
<Meth> yet you didnt let my campaign thread stay :p
<Wrek> 05ofc it will lag for some
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's 15 minutes to 6 AM. I don't know how Wrek does it, but I might as well just not sleep.
<Stormy> It's just in the spam section
<Wrek> 05what im tryign to test is the quality
<Eddmario> P0N3: I think you mean because it has CGI timber wolves in it.
<P0N3> Seriously Applejack is a TOTAL badass with those timberwolves.
<AssertiveFluttershy> I know Wrek
<Deacon> honestly, totally forgot there was an episode this week
<Spyrorocks> I would have let it stay.
<LadyCanary> Quality is lovely.
<Stormy> I don't delete threads
<sub06905> its in 720p? i thought i would get lag
<Java> PonyGuyRulz: Actually they change it again to Dr Whoof.
<RDash5000> so, who owns that balloon anyway?
<Stormy> lol, should I move it back?
<P0N3> Blam.
<Barbetos> Call your ISP and complain that you are getting laggy pony
<P0N3> Faceplant.
<PonyGuyRulz> Java: That's good
<otakon> RDash5000: Cherry Picker
<KrazyNoobs> To tell the truth, I disliked the episode. I liked Spike as a character, but this proved him to be a huge tool. Hopefully, they can fix him in a future episode.
<Barbetos> They will fix the issue right away.
<Meth> yeah
<Stormy> probably not now because it'll be all spammy
<Java> RDash5000: It's owned by the city.
<Kammerjunk> RDash5000: It's Celestia's. If she finds out, she'll send Spike to roast in a volcano for 1000 years.
<P0N3> Baby dragons sure are made of tough stuff.
<RDash5000> Java: that makes sense
<Kammerjunk> Because fate is a cruel mistress.
<Wrek> 05try fullscreening
<otakon> Kammerjunk: he doesn't roast remember?
<anton> thats the best knot ever made if it can be unknotted when spike its it
<P0N3> Spike can bathe in magma. He wouldn't care.
<Spyrorocks> delete all Meth 's threads.
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Teller dammit.
<Wrek> 05id liek soem feedback on that
<Gloomfury> evening all
<anton> hits*
<Meth> I only have 2 threads
<Buytoast> the timberwolves still look too out of place to me
<Eddmario> Dat CGI...
<Stormy> see, here it is http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12946-vote-breaking-bad-for-moderator.html
<the_real_pony_1604> I am watching in FS. looks pretty good Wrek
<RDash5000> Wrek: lookin' good on my end :)
<Barbetos> suddenly 3d
<Drew> Wrek, Full screen is great
<Deacon> hello new animation test
<P0N3> The Timberwolves seem to pretty much be golems.
<the_real_pony_1604> and only 3 times the normal stream data also. very nice
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> eww 3d
<Wrek> 05id prefer them to have used flash like normally for those super advanced animation moves the wolves have
<Barbetos> its not so bad
<Jim> Wrek, Fullscreen looks brilliant, not getting much lag either
<Eddmario> Deacon: Technically, the Timber wolves in this episode weren't the first time 3D was used in the show...
<P0N3> Who enchants those timberwolves, that's what I want to know.
<Wrek> 05but i also realize the shitload of work that would go into it
<Wrek> 05so i can compeltly understand why they went with it
<Bigcheese> I like well done 3d work.
<Java> Gonna toggle it full screen
<otakon> ^
<Wrek> 05but i dont like it
<Buytoast> the amount of work is the only reason it doesn't bother me too much
<Buytoast> but still
<Stormy> Hahahah "I assure you free furry fans for all!" "isn't that about 80% of the reason deviantART exists?"
<Deacon> oh boy, here we go....
<otakon> dat hug
<KrazyNoobs> They were reduced to using 3D.
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, Im going to test this cdn out, if everything is cool we might have to work on something....
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> yeah those 3d models look too... 3d-ish
<P0N3> I like how the CG is understated.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :P
<otakon> WOOKIE LIFEDEBT!
<Eddmario> Timber wolves should be a conjuration summon in Skyrim
<Kammerjunk> Well, computer-generated imagery isn't exactly as rough as it used to be.
<P0N3> And to be fair, the show is Flash. Flash has 3D.
<KrazyNoobs> DO NOT WANT CG
<otakon> Spike is Chewbacca, AJ is Han Solo
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: still looks weird
<anton> ya its not like he accidently unknotted it
<Stormy> okay, cool
<otakon> Bye Cherry Picker
<Stormy> hopefully it works out
<Bigcheese> You guys do realize that _all_ of mlp is cg, right?
<P0N3> I actually think the 3D was used to pretty good effect.
<Drew> It does look strange now that you mention it
<Bronysith> otakon: yea no
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: It does have an obvious difference when put in a Flash show.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Bigcheese: eeyup
<otakon> Bigcheese: yeah but it's 2D flash compared to 3D flash
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: which makes it stick out and look gross
<RDash5000> if spike works all day writing and carrying heavy objects, why is he so clumsy?
<KrazyNoobs> Although they could have done this episode a lot better. We rarely get a Spike episode, and it was handed over to Merriweather.
<Deacon> Bigcheese computer graphics, yes
<Bigcheese> otakon: yes.
<otakon> Bronysith: she's CHERRY PICKER!
<Spyrorocks> we might have to ask princess-dairy to let us do a stress-test on bronystate.
<RaveBrony> Woah, wha?
<Bronysith> otakon: you made a bad star wars reference
<otakon> damn that's a big sow
<P0N3> I don't care what they use as long as it looks good, and I think it looks great.
<Bronysith> otakon: prepare to be assimilated
<RDash5000> if spike works all day writing and carrying heavy objects, why is he so clumsy?
<otakon> Bronysith: wait NO
<Barbetos> just seems lazy AJ. Dropping it down there like that.
<Spyrorocks> princess-dairy, do you own bronystate/started it or is it a collaboration?>
<Jim> Pigglet Sparkle
<otakon> lol
<Drew> How did he clean it? he knocked the bucket over
<P0N3> Spike is used to working in a library.
<princess-dairy> I don't own it
<Buytoast> man they really did turn Spoke into a bumbling dingus in this new horse
<Bigcheese> I don't get clumbsy spike.
<RaveBrony> You all watch ponies?? Eeeeewwww
<KrazyNoobs> Hi RaveBrony
<otakon> dat AJ
<otakon> is ADORABLE
<Jim> RaveBrony, Ewww, nooo
<RaveBrony> Hey KrazyNoobs :)
<otakon> er Applebloom actually
<Eddmario> I forgot that Honey Boo Boo had a small cameo during this scene...
<otakon> dammit I'm tired
*Bronysith takes otakon away
<Barbetos> Hrm. I wonder. It may be a computer issue too.
<Bigcheese> He is fully capable of cleaning Twi's crap.
<Meth> lol
<otakon> lol disclaimer on the bottom
<anton> how is spike better as twilights assistant than applejack
<Deacon> and then the pig got dirty again
<Deacon> XD
<Bigcheese> He does mess up every so often.
<Stormy> but we would be their competition
<otakon> he's too excited
<P0N3> Bigcheese, he worked in a library.
<Barbetos> Some compies can't handle 720 at all
<the_real_pony_1604> does ustream let you do multi resolution, Wrek?
<Drew> Twi has a spell on him
<otakon> THAT is why he's acting up
<Kammerjunk> Well, the thing is that Spike is used to working for a Mane character. Must be strange working for a background pony.
<RaveBrony> PIES
<Spyrorocks> nah we can work together or something.
<Deacon> Kammerjunk O U
<the_real_pony_1604> I know livestream will if you have an upgraded account
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> anton: Magic. No, srsly, that's the only logical explanation
<Wrek> 05the_real_pony_1604: nope
<RaveBrony> Tabitha awesomeness
<Spyrorocks> or tell them to pound sand and do our own thing. either way.
<Anger> damnit spike
<KrazyNoobs> I also think this episode lacked character.
<RaveBrony> I agree
<KrazyNoobs> Or, at least, wrecked spike's character
<P0N3> I doubt Spike has cooked more than popcorn in his life. Twilight doesn't seem like the type to cook more than toast for breakfast, herself.
<Jim> Bro Code
<Bigcheese> Any computer than can't handle 1080p is pretty lame.
<Buytoast> this episode also lakced being good
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> You just made that up, didn't you Spike?
<anton> SirGanjalfTheGreen: maybe.
<RaveBrony> Rarity's character was spot on :3
<Stormy> should we register a domain and stuff?
<Wrek> 05Bigcheese: its a connection issue
<Spyrorocks> not now
<Eddmario> Twilight when she's reading = me when gaming
<Wrek> 05and to be frank
<Bigcheese> Wrek: and hence not a computer issue.
<Spyrorocks> because whenever I register a domain that signals the end of a project
<Wrek> 05internet is veeeery young
<KrazyNoobs> Pinkie was the only character that I liked in this ep.
<Kammerjunk> P0N3: I know, I don't get all the fics where Spike is a master chef.
<P0N3> I love this part.
<Spyrorocks> and I get bored and do something else
<Wrek> 05you cannot expect everyoen to have fast speeds
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> mhmm
<P0N3> She's like, "Not now Spike, doing books."
<Stormy> lol
<Spyrorocks> I have so many domains that I register then I get bored and not finish it.
<Barbetos> that library has the most confusing door ever.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> mhmm
<PonyGuyRulz> lol this is my third time watching this today
<the_real_pony_1604> 1080 isn't the problem, connection speed is a big part of it and then alot of monitors max out at 1440x900
<P0N3> Spike as a master chef? I'd like to read those!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well that update killed optifine
<Stormy> sounds like everything I ever try to do
<RaveBrony> Damn Twi..... ouch.....
<Kammerjunk> P0N3: Every. Single. HiE. Ever.
<Deacon> that poor kitchen
<Meth> I think I win.
<Meth> I promise NO TAXES, and I will ban Afflict I will also give Drugs to the Children! Also, I am the sexiest one here!
<Kammerjunk> Well, that's a lie, there are some good HiE fics.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> "Whatever. I can ask Celestia to send me another slave any time."
<Jim> Foreeeever
<P0N3> Yeah I don't get very excited about reading HIE fics.
<Wrek> 05i liek AJ's faces in this one
<anton> the poor pie
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, lol
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<otakon> HE HAS A BUSINESS CARD
<Meth> You can give me one of the Domains :p
<PonyGuyRulz> two aj episodes in a row?
<Spyrorocks> I get too many ideas and always finish stuff 50%
<otakon> seriously he HAS A BUSINESS CARD
<princess-dairy> Well if we have some kind of partnership I'm sure we wouldn't mind helping with a stress test, but if you're setting up as competition they probably wouldn't be so keen to help. :P
<PonyGuyRulz> good job hasbro
<Barbetos> best aj faces in this episode.
<KrazyNoobs> The only thing I liked in this episode was the stache.
<Spyrorocks> OK, you get "methisdumbdumb.com"
<otakon> oh Lord
<P0N3> A business card in crayon. XD
<Meth> I do?
<Java> There are several HiE fanfic that actually worth the read.
<Barbetos> This is more of a spike episode, with AJ roped in.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> otakon: Oh my Teller... It even has a WATERMARK!
<anton> not the AXE!!!
<Meth> Can you make it a .edu domain?
<Spyrorocks> maybe
<RDash5000> Java: have you read Hands?
<otakon> SirGanjalfTheGreen: lol
<RaveBrony> I like to see more AJ, so Im fine with it
<PonyGuyRulz> still, more aj sreen time
<otakon> yes to Rarity
<P0N3> Ha ha loved Applejack's nonchalance there.
<Java> The borin one usually consist of brony came to Equestria.
<Stormy> methisdumbdumb.edu
<otakon> poor Rarity
<Anger> this episode has so much fan canon possiblities in it
<PonyGuyRulz> screen
<Spyrorocks> I need to find a way to monetize the stream
<Meth> Yep
<Stormy> interesting
<Kencolt> Arrow 18. Read that. HiE, but differnt and believea ble.
<otakon> and we KNOW SPike can bake
<Deacon> Anger like?
<anton> i bet applejack is enjoying this part
<Spyrorocks> without making hasbro angry.
<Buytoast> at least the worst horse has to eat bad pie
<otakon> he mades those cookies
<jcelios> only good HiE fic I know of is the voltaire one
<otakon> lol
<P0N3> I bet Applejack enjoyed that.
<Wrek> 05a good HiE is TTEOAP
<KrazyNoobs> Also, when the "fight" scene came up, I was hoping they wouldn't stuff it up like Twi vs. Ursa Minor or Twi vs. the three headed dog.
<Jim> nom
<Java> RDash5000: Yeah. Interesting read. Not the best but silly.
<P0N3> She doesn't seem fond of Rarity.
<Anger> the fanfics are being writen as we speak
<Meth> lol
<Meth> Title it "Big Ponies Vol. 1"
<otakon> I can hear teh pens scribbling
<Wrek> 05i dont like many fics
<RaveBrony> Bringing back the Spike love?
<RaveBrony> Odd
<Wrek> 05the ocne i can manage to read are crossovers
<PonyGuyRulz> If Rarity doesn't know Spike likes her, she is dumber than derpy
<Wrek> 05prefferably sci fi
<RDash5000> slave driver
<Spyrorocks> OK wtf... http://i.imgur.com/bTSGY.gif
<Deacon> of course rarity would like an assistant
<Kammerjunk> Java: Hell, my current favourite fic is a brony coming to Equestria. The difference is that it has originality. That, and character and world building.
<P0N3> Forever in her debt. Isn't she just awful.
<RaveBrony> Oh Rarity <3
<Buytoast> originality
<PonyGuyRulz> typical Rarity
<Buytoast> AND cahracter?
<Java> The good one is when an astronaut crash landed on Equestria.
<Buytoast> so he's.../
<Buytoast> AND ORIGINAL CHARACTER?
<KrazyNoobs> Also, I love this reference
<Kammerjunk> See, this is what I'm telling you. Rarity is such a dom.
<Java> Kammerjunk: Title?
<Drew> lol, well put
<otakon> SLAVERY!
<RDash5000> Java: good read
<P0N3> What IS it with Rainbow Dash and windows.
<otakon> wait
<PonyGuyRulz> how is a broom going to help clean out soap
<Eddmario> self-insert fics are now canon.
<Stormy> ...
<Stormy> .....
<KrazyNoobs> I want to read that fanfic.
<otakon> unfinished novels?
<Stormy> uh
<P0N3> She's always peeping and interjecting into conversations through windows.
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: Terribly, innit?
<otakon> FANFICS?!
<RaveBrony> RD visiting Rarity?.....Nope O_o
<otakon> FANFIC JOKES!?
<Stormy> no idea
<RaveBrony> ^
<Spyrorocks> dont ask.
<otakon> XD
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, am I the only one who actually likes fandom-pandering?
<princess-dairy> Oh, so that's where "felind disrepect from behind" comes from
<otakon> KrazyNoobs: hell no
<Anger> i'd buy that novel id RD wrote it
<Jim> If you know what she means
<P0N3> Rainbow Dash is a total peeping Tammy.
<Java> KrazyNoobs: I;m okay with it.
<Anger> if*
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> relevant: http://i.imgur.com/Djuk3.png
<Stormy> inb4 secret but fun
<PonyGuyRulz> how old do you think the mane six is
<Barbetos> P0N3 you want the truth? Merchandising!!
*Stallion_of_War dat clear stream
<otakon> lol
<Spyrorocks> lololol
<Deacon> KrazyNoobs what exactly is pandering to?
<Barbetos> She makes money
<Kammerjunk> Java: Love Mine, it's on FiMFiction. Was one of the first Changeling fics I read, lots of theory-building about Changelings.
<Drew> XD
<Stallion_of_War> pfft I make towers of stone all the time...
<otakon> Deacon: stuff only the older more involved fans wuold get
<P0N3> What does Rainbow Dash peeping have to do with merchandizing? They can bring her into the episode lots of ways.
<anton> what did spike do in the kitchen to knock off the pipe
<otakon> it's Tom's family reunion!
<RaveBrony> Poor Rarity :I
<KrazyNoobs> otakon: xD
<Deacon> otakon ha
<Barbetos> P0N3 the fact that they bring her into episodes. The windows is merely a device.
<Gloomfury> i wanna rock
<otakon> there is no good news
<Anger> how come spike is good at being twi's assistant but not AJ's
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Holy Steampunk! http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/365/9/3/this_is_war_by_nastylady-d5pstwf.png
<Spyrorocks> Imma throw together a stream test
<Kammerjunk> Java: I'd recommend waiting, though. Bit of a gap between updates, but it does happen every blue moon.
<Deacon> shouldn't be a problem, she kicked down trees
<Java> Kammerjunk: I think I remember that one. It's about a changeling after the battle of Canterlot right? I don't know....
<Stallion_of_War> Two family records in a row? That's a record!
<Spyrorocks> and you can all watch it and see if it works
<Buytoast> steampunk is still bleh
<Barbetos> She has a peter pan complex with windows
<Anger> steampunk is cool
<otakon> SirGanjalfTheGreen: holy steampunk!
<Stormy> yay
<Christian_Carter|GoL> I'm Finally Back!
<otakon> TOM!
<RDash5000> Java: check out Into The Black: A Mare's Tale. Kinda poor start, but it gets REALLY great!
<KrazyNoobs> BUt yeah, they shouldn't have wrecked spike in this episode.
<Barbetos> flying up to them
<PonyGuyRulz> spike is the new apple jack
<P0N3> I'm gonna write a comic now. Rarity takes out a restraining order against Rainbow Dash.
<Barbetos> peeping in
<Barbetos> or wahtever.
<P0N3> Within 50 feet of her residence.
<Meth> k
<Christian_Carter> I'm back everyone!
<Drew> Smash into rocks! so good
<Kammerjunk> Java: No, but it talks about it.
<otakon> and RD had to go back to the hospital
<CriticKitten> ded
<Deacon> yo Christian_Carter, welcome returns!
<Java> Kammerjunk: I see
<P0N3> Fics need more peeping Rainbow.

<Christian_Carter> PonyGuyRulz: Yep

<CriticKitten> Why exactly does Spike have a sudden obsession with work?
<PonyGuyRulz> Christian_Carter: cool welcome back
<RaveBrony> Dragon Code

<PonyGuyRulz> Christian_Carter: yep

<RaveBrony> otakon: Hmm?
<Java> LOL
<Deacon> CriticKitten because merrieter
<Deacon> apparently
<Java> I worried about Twilight
*Christian_Carter eats a random sandwich
<RaveBrony> I loved that AJ face
<otakon> RaveBrony: inflation... saw it on TechTV once... kind of creepy
<Java> 's OCD
<RaveBrony> otakon: Oh :I
<anton> the easiest way to break twilights focus
<P0N3> Obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
<Stallion_of_War> FFS I need to upgrade my TV package to get the Hub in HD
<jcelios> OCPD - Obsessive Compulsive Pony Disorder :$
<Java> I remember stumble upon an inflation fanfic for ponies on FFnet. It's... weird.
<Christian_Carter> I'm listening to music on my apple tv
<anton> knock over the ink holder thingy
<CriticKitten> It's so important that we've never mentioned it in the show before now, despite showing dragons on multiple occasions!
<otakon> counting blades of grass
<Gloomfury> best parte
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<Drew> I love pinie! XD
<anton> isk whats it called

<RaveBrony> Gotta love Pinkie
<otakon> :)
<Christian_Carter> Pony: People Obviously Not You
<Drew> pinkie*
<Deacon> what....an elaborate plan pinkie
<P0N3> Yeah Spike is accustomed to Twilight's OCPD.
<otakon> WE LOVE YOU PINKIE!
<P0N3> Doesn't even question counting grass.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> mmmmustache
<otakon> YES
<Barbetos> Pinkie you can ONLY wear a mustache if it comes in pink
<Stallion_of_War> If Spike breaths fire... couldn't they just burn the TIMBERwolves?
<otakon> oh God
<otakon> OH GOD
<Java> Dammit let her wear the moustache!
<Afflict[phone]> So what are you doing, i have no clue
<Eddmario> Pinkie looks actually pretty good with the mustache
<Panda> Rarity is the only good part of this episode.
<otakon> DOES ANYONE REMEMBER SEALAB 2021?
<Anger> pinkie's mustache of evil
<KrazyNoobs> AJ, you suck.
<Java> I think many ponies are good in this.
<RaveBrony> Rarityyyy <3
<Deacon> I love this part
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Yes
<PonyGuyRulz> no party canon
<Stallion_of_War> Is that the first time Twilight teleported where the camera didn't follow her?
<RaveBrony> Epic part :D
<Java> AJ acting was hilarious
<Barbetos> otakon whats that?
<PonyGuyRulz> lol
<Panda> Bad acting :)
<Eddmario> Anybody else notice there's been leaks for almost every episode this season?
<otakon> Barbetos: oh lord I'll have to show you
<CriticKitten> Hoooooo
<Java> RD "roar" is funny
<otakon> but I just got an idea for a short
<Barbetos> i know what it is actually XD
<thelonecubone|GoW3> otakon: if i remember correctly, It aired during Adult swim?
<Java> FS is cute with her "clopping"
<KrazyNoobs> At least this scene is full of originality. Reminds me of Season 1 a bit. :)
<the_real_pony_1604> RD can be a VA
<Barbetos> Just never really watched it properly.
<P0N3> Maybe that's what Applejack is really like in distress.
<otakon> thelonecubone|GoW3: eeeeeeeeeyup
<Stormy> 1080p pony stream
<P0N3> Isn't that a weird thought?
<Kencolt> AJ is many things. A good actor isn't one of them.
<Spyrorocks> just testing a stream thing.
<Stormy> hopefully
<KrazyNoobs> inb4 <_< >_> <_< spam
<Afflict[phone]> ok
<RaveBrony> JEssus
<PonyGuyRulz> wat is rd
<P0N3> Applejack is tough. Being in distress, for her, is just being annoyed.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #45
<KrazyNoobs> doohoohoohoohooohoomed
<Java> lol pinkie
<RDash5000> RD is best SFX pony
<thelonecubone|GoW3> otakon: I love that show as a kid, even thou i didnt understand most of the suggetid part back then
<Anger> how the hell does RD do that roar?
<CriticKitten> Too casual.
<otakon> Barbetos: there is a scene where Murphy has a moustache and he's getting on with the blonde and he's like "You want the mustache on or off?" "off please" .... "too bad"
<thelonecubone|GoW3> suggested*
<anton> thats the best timberwolf ever
<otakon> just replace the visuals with Pinkie and AJ
<PonyGuyRulz> lol
<Deacon> Anger from pinkie of course
<P0N3> She can howl like a boss.
<KrazyNoobs> <_<
<RaveBrony> nom
<PonyGuyRulz> XD
<Java> OH COME ON AJ!
<Drew> Dat voice
<Kencolt> Aj... just, no.
<RDash5000> wut
<thelonecubone|GoW3> brb, Match >:3
<MissVenom> jeez RD...what a roar....
<P0N3> Rainbow Dash needs her own black metlal band.
<anton> worst play ever i want my money back!!!!
<Java> That's bad and you should feel bad!
<twilight_sprinkle> :O
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Well, looks like Spike didn't got Fooled. No Vegas for you, Applejack>_>
<Jim> Poor acting ruins the day
<Anger> big fat phony
<Stallion_of_War> DOES NOPONY RELIZE THAT WOOD IS FLAMMABLE, AND THAT SPIKE IS A WALKING FLAMETHROWER???? :[
<twilight_sprinkle> but you forgot that the timberwolves were made in 3d flash, not 2d!
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, another thing I hate about this episode is how they make Spike stupid
<P0N3> Rainbow Dash is best metal growling pony.
<Gloomfury> death comes
<Barbetos> did she just blink in the same spot as spike?
<RDash5000> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Wrek> 05note that the huge timberwolf is in flash
<Anger> love how twi just leaves spike to die
<superretroworld> what the hell is that kind of design?
<Wrek> 05due to not havign to run
<Barbetos> surprised that did not explode him or something
<Java> ow
<PonyGuyRulz> happy new year's eve east coast america
<P0N3> Is it me or was that 'ow' undeniably unbrearably cute?
<Java> Decepticon
<berberborscing> Yay, Spike will finally learn a lesson
<Anger> oh sheet its the 31st.
<twilight_sprinkle> time for most epic villain death ever
<otakon> Okay you know what?
<KrazyNoobs> One thing I hate about the show itself is that it sets up a good fight scene to occur, and then they make it gay. aka. Twi vs. Ursa Minor, Twi. vs three headed dog, or this.
<P0N3> Yeah Applejack doesn't do 'distress'.
<Eulshy> Choking!
<Anger> its meh bday :D
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: She did. Perhaps teleportation creates an expanding bubble at the exact middle of the destination.
<anton> im real life if timberwolves were real a rock wouldnt stop them
<Jim> nomm
<Deacon> holy crap, a super timberwolf
<RaveBrony> Skill Shot!
<Eulshy> Choking!
<RDash5000> worst. boss fight. ever.
<otakon> Timber Wolves must be the glass cannons of Equestria
<PonyGuyRulz> insta kill
<otakon> seriously they fought a MANTICORE and didnt' flinch
<KrazyNoobs> THEY COULD HAVE DONE THIS WAY BETTER. :[ :[
<Jim> Victory!
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> CRIT HIT!
*Stallion_of_War Dear Princess Celestia, Today I didn't learn to use my fire breath to burn highly flammable monsters. You're faithful student, Spike
<otakon> they faced a DRAGON and didn't run
<MissVenom> double points
<Drew> ded
<otakon> three timber wolves show up and they all scatter like leaves
<Barbetos> They HAD to face those things though otakon
<Java> The Timberwolves is Engish :p
<Java> was
<P0N3> It would have been hilarious if he incinerated that thing and sent it straight to Princess Celestia.
<KrazyNoobs> Plus, spike should have burped fire at them.
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: its not a show about cool fight scenes though
<RaveBrony> otakon: Becuz FS has a way with animals, not wood :D
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> ;): A ROCK?! That's his weakness?
<Eulshy> I would run like hell from 3 timberwolves
<Wrek> 05FS is good with wood?
<otakon> RaveBrony: good point but they still FOUGHT WITH A MANTICORE
<Wrek> 05what?
<otakon> wait
<Kammerjunk> So... Was that the story of that guy and Goliath?
<otakon> FS wants to be a tree
<P0N3> Princess Celestia, reading a scroll on her pillow. Suddenly, big green wall of fire. TImberwolf out of nowhere.
<Barbetos> Timberwolves have always been ran from in this show.
<KrazyNoobs> twilight_sprinkle: Who are they making this show for, by the way? We are the ones they are trying to entertain when they make the show.'
<Eulshy> otakon, q manticore, 3 timberwolves
<otakon> Timberwolves are wolves made from tree's
<Anger> why isnt the timberwolf coming back to life?
<Barbetos> So they must be a pretty serious threat
<RDash5000> awwwwwwwww
<Stallion_of_War> Spike didn't Teleport the corn cakes when he used his fire to cook them...
<Wrek> 05so
<Gloomfury> snugglebutt
<Java> no KrazyNoobs, it's for children first.
<Anger> and how is the lamp still up?
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: they said they will continue to aim it primarily at children
<P0N3> They're apparently some sort of magically enchanted golem. Who knows where they come from.
<RaveBrony> otakon: Yeah, there was a picture showing your point, I dont have a link atm tho :(
<Wrek> 05that proves we can have high quality streams
<Deacon> hand sha...er, pinkie pro...uh... fist bump
<otakon> Eulshy: Manticore that was twice the size of one TW and a DRAGON nearly 10 times bigger
<Wrek> 05but why have that if it costs users
<Barbetos> I saw all them P's Wrek
<Barbetos> All 720 of them.
<Spyrorocks> Ill just stream direct from a 1080p file
<superretroworld> being raised in ponyville would be so awsome
<Jim> I had 3-4 hickups during the episode, nothing major
<Eulshy> otakon, element of surprise
<P0N3> Yeah, superretroworld, except for all the frigging monsters.
<berberborscing> In some videos I can see 1080 pixels.
<otakon> Wrek: good point, I'm happy with 480p I got a bit a lag but it was fine mostly
<Kammerjunk> Stallion_of_War: Maybe it's an instinctual thing that can be triggered conciously.
<Wrek> 05its 6 in the morning...
<the_real_pony_1604> Wrek, I can tell you that I was having problems with the normal stream when I was at my parents place over the holidays. they just have DSL
<otakon> TIME FOR A DRINK!
<KrazyNoobs> java and twilight_sprinkle: Well, that honestly sucks. I think children can definitely handle fight scenes, but then soccermoms will probably complain about it.
<Drew> 1080p is pushing it
<Stallion_of_War> Task Manager; Lightweight browser - kill all unnecessary processor usage -> handle HD streams
<superretroworld> P0N3: true that
<Petrified_Discord> You'd think living next to a forest filled with deadly mythical creatures would deter ponies, but nope.
<Deacon> the stream was fime on my end, and I'm picking up internet from a house away
<LadyCanary> To bed with you Wreky
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: That's what I told you. I don't know how you do it.
*LadyCanary smooch Wrek.
<KrazyNoobs> Hi
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: not even about the soccer moms, i dont watch this show for fight scenes either
<RaveBrony> Dat chat
<otakon> YEAH!

<berberborscing> Bottom: real show
<RDash5000> Java: nah, imma play vidjah games
<Anger> yes it Deacon
<RDash5000> bye
<KrazyNoobs> twilight_sprinkle: I watch the show because it is awesome, but they should at least make it better. This show has great potential, in my opinion, and I love it the way it is. If they wish to continue producing it in this way, I wouldn't mind; it just has to be good.
<Java> Java: VIDYAH!
<Barbetos> berberborscing wat?
<berberborscing> That cello is so real that it makes Octavia look fake.
<Deacon> berberborscing well she is a cartoon
<KrazyNoobs> ^
<otakon> yeah the detail on the cello is awesome Wrek
<Java> Next time can we watch Gravity Falls?
<PonyGuyRulz> one thing that would help the show is more strong male character development
<LadyCanary> No.
<Wrek> 05enjoy awesoem music
<LadyCanary> Whatever streams streams, Java.
<Wrek> 05also im slightly tipsy
<otakon> PonyGuyRulz: Shining Armor
<Wrek> 05best time to draw
<RaveBrony> Hah
<berberborscing> Vinyl has disappeared from this image.
<Kammerjunk> Java: Oh, watched that yesterday. Was in Danish, so slightly worse than it could've been, but good nonetheless.
<Java> LadyCanary: Well, they accept imputs.
<PonyGuyRulz> yeah but he always gets hipnotized or something
<otakon> Wrek: so what was that RArity we saw eh? A little sauce like the old days? :P
<KrazyNoobs> dat detail
<Java> They can consider it for latter.
<KrazyNoobs> wow.
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: im just saying, its not about the fights being grand, imo, awesome is subjective after all, and s1 was never focused on epic fights
<Kammerjunk> Holy caucasian males, that is detail.
<KrazyNoobs> twilight_sprinkle: I don't care about the fights
<Eulshy> well bye
<Deacon> ooh, wood texture
<otakon> bye Eul...gone
<Deacon> seeya eul-- oh

<otakon> ...
<berberborscing> Now make it all a diamond cello.
<otakon> NINETEEN DAYS!?
<KrazyNoobs> Tom: IT ISN'T CALLED KEEP CALM AND FLUTTER ON
<RaveBrony> Yup

<Wrek> 05lets listen to one of their good ones
<Java> Forza?
<P0N3> Someone has my taste in music.
<berberborscing> Need For Speed World
<Java> oh
<berberborscing> I really REALLY watn Forza 4 though
<berberborscing> Gonna get it by next month
<Gloomfury> damn ads!
<Java> I'm good with my GT5
<P0N3> Can we get some Dio up?
<berberborscing> I thought that cello had enough detail on it...
<LadyCanary> There is never enough.
<berberborscing> Then he'll never finish this image
<P0N3> Anything from Master of the Moon or Stand Up and Shout would be perfect.
<berberborscing> pon3, just mute it and play song in background then
<Spyrorocks> no
<Spyrorocks> just a test
<Meth> :o
<P0N3> Aw. Was hoping op was a dio fan.:)
<Gloomfury> who dont like dio?
<P0N3> Good question.
<P0N3> Stuffy people?
<berberborscing> I figured out how to get AdBlock for chrome. Anyone know how to get it for mozilla firefox
<Jim> I love the detail he always put in his pictures'
<Jim> Made with so much care
<P0N3> Yeah this art is pretty kick ass.
<P0N3> Who'
<P0N3> Who's doing this?
<Jim> P0N3, Wrek
<berberborscing> Wrek, I think?
<P0N3> Nice job Wrek! I like your art.

<berberborscing> Him finishing up the cello
<P0N3> This rock has good drums.
<Java> berberborscing: I upload several of my GT5 photos on Gran Turismo photo viewer. The problem is they show the photos randomly so I can't point out which one is my car. Here's the website: http://www.gran-turismo.com/sg/gt5/photo/
<P0N3> It can be hard to find a really good drummer.
<berberborscing> These are all so high quality my eyes are crying in awesomeness
<WymanDaBrony> I wonder how long this will take...
<WymanDaBrony> #Spike
<berberborscing> Which car and what color
<Gloomfury> what band is this agian?
<Drew> He does the eyes perfectly
<berberborscing> Car model & color
<Java> berberborscing: Not shown. It was rotated every day.
<berberborscing> oh
<RaveBrony> Mfw I try to zoom in on the pic from my computer :D
<Java> It only available for region 3 GT5 though.
<superretroworld> #youcanhashtag?
<superretroworld> cool
<WymanDaBrony> YEP
<Wrek> 05this is oen of my fav songs with these guys
*P0N3 listens to Alone at the Landfill.
<Wrek> 05enjoy
<the_real_pony_1604> just because you can doesn't mean you should. do it enough and the mods will speak up
<Wrek> 05the solos are fantastic
<RaveBrony> I really wish I was here when he did the wood design :(
<Jim> guise, fullscreening the stream is amazing
<P0N3> Dave McGraw, also a good drummer.
<Java> Maybe Wrek can put out a short tutorial for wood later... wait.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Stormy> cool
<Java> That's a skin?
<Jim> ALL the detail
<Java> Imported skin?
<MissVenom> ....wut .-.
<Meth> :d
<Wrek> 05hidden layers ftw
<berberborscing> Machinery or snowfalkes?
<P0N3> Looks like gears.
<LadyCanary> :O
<P0N3> So, probably steampunk.
<Java> So that's just skin?
<LadyCanary> Ooooh.
<Jim> So steampunk
<P0N3> I like magepunk.
<Java> I like Desertpunk
<P0N3> Like the Jawas?
<berberborscing> A question: can you vinylize cars in GT5?
<Java> Vinylise?
<P0N3> Hee hee. Java Jawa.
<berberborscing> Add vinyls.
<P0N3> Jawas on espresso. Dear god.
<Java> You mean replace the hood with carbon fiber?
<berberborscing> no
<berberborscing> add purple stripes
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Java> Not really. When you paint you paint the whole body.
<berberborscing> Sounds just like NFSMW 2012!
<Java> If you want to "pimp" the car you better go with Forza then
<berberborscing> I lived playing Import Tuner when I was little ^^
<berberborscing> NFSU and NFSU2
<Java> berberborscing: Is it any good?
<berberborscing> One of best games in NFS history.
<Wrek> 05love this solo
<RaveBrony> Damn it.... now I feel like I have to draw...
<Java> I rarely play NFS games. I was playing Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero.
<berberborscing> Deepest customization, but only street cars, like Mitsubishi Eclipse or Toyota Corolla
<berberborscing> Underground 1 had the Honda S2000 and the Integra I think
<Java> Can we import images from outside sources?
<Saturn> 08,01and then my computer exploded
<soulrider95> I liked the old hot pursuit :<
<P0N3> So far this is looking like a pretty great picture.
<Jim> Saturn, Bang
<Saturn> 08,01i love Damascus in AssCreed
<Saturn> 08,01it's so cool
<Drew> Yeha
<P0N3> Does anyone else have constantly pot-smoking neighbours?
<P0N3> That stuff stinks so bad.
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i could go there for realsies and be some kind of rich merchant
<Gloomfury> my dad smoks pot
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: my neighbours do
<berberborscing> Three SUVs in NFSU2, them being Hummer H2, Lincoln Navigator, and Cadillac Escalade
<P0N3> Isn't it a pain?
<P0N3> I live in VIctoria BC so I have my window open like all the time.
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: i don't know, i've never asked them
<Drew> wrek is so smoth XD
<P0N3> Sometimes I come home, and my home is just full of pot reek.
<Jim> You best be packing some serious time-machineage and psychic paperage then
<berberborscing> http://www.fdwallpapers.com/games/images/nfs_underground2.jpg
<Java> berberborscing: Is Hummer fast enough?
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: suggestion: get some pot yourself, then you won't care.
<berberborscing> SUVs have their own races with SUVs only
<Meth> :p
<Saturn> 08,01and the whole situation will seem kinda funny
<Java> Image borked
<P0N3> Lol. There's an idea. But no, I'm a grownup... I don't smoke pot any more.
<Saturn> 08,01how old are you?
<berberborscing> Once I was in 6th grade, the asshole of life itself...
<P0N3> I just drink like all the other old ladies.:P
<berberborscing> And I sat next to this kid named Brandon
<Java> berberborscing: The best mixed race is in Motostorm. It's just fun.
<pony_1272> ?
<P0N3> Honestly? I'd say none of your business, but I'll tell tonight. I'm in my early thirties.
<berberborscing> He failed intensive math
<berberborscing> He smoked pot
<berberborscing> He hated the bus driver with a burning passion
<berberborscing> He raped me once
<berberborscing> He threatened to kill m
<Java> PON3: Are we all old here?
<berberborscing> and so... yeah
<Java> berberborscing: Wait WHAT?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Celestia Radio's Top 100 Music Countdown
<RaveBrony> What??
<Java> he what?
<Jim> I like this version of this song
<berberborscing> He was kicked off the bus next year. The driver couldn't take him.
<Saturn> 08,01ah, in that case, you're in that age range between when it's okay to smoke pot because you're young and stupid, and when it's okay to smoke pot because you're old and wise
<Saturn> 08,01or in pain
<pony_1272> yay wrek time
<P0N3> Well I sure feel old sometimes.
<P0N3> Things move so fast now, with technology and culture.
<berberborscing> Brandon was some serious emo shit.
<RaveBrony> Y'all and youre drugs....bleh.
<Saturn> 08,01are you past Logan's Run age?
<Java> Now 30 is considered old :(
<MissVenom> i leave for 5 seconds...i come back to "he raped me once"....nice
<Java> bleh
<Saturn> 08,01if not, you have nothing to be worried about
<P0N3> I can't wait to be old. THen you get all the good drugs legally.
<Drew> I'm 17 and feel old :I
<berberborscing> He talked very deeply into the bus driver, like saying "I hope you get back to molesting your mother and die in the fiery burning pit of hell"
<berberborscing> He listened to Slipknot and his favorite movie was Saw II
<Saturn> 08,01berberborscing: enhance your calm. no more talking of such stuff in here. this is a nice place, for nice people.
<P0N3> Go to Mr. pharmacist man. He's like, "Here, have these drugs. Go enjoy the rest of your life."
<P0N3> I will now!
<berberborscing> I apologize Saturn.
<LooF> does anyone know the band name?
<berberborscing> That was the worst year of my life indeed. ^^
<P0N3> Berberborscing, he sounds like a typical burnout type.
<J_E_Smith71> Hey Saturn when you said earlier today about doing donations, just so you know if you did I'd probably give. When I said "Not Sure" I didn't mean I wasn't sure if I would I just meant I wasn't sure how much I could give
<P0N3> Sorry he raped you, that's not cool.
<berberborscing> Like the kid that tried to bomb the school, Jared Cano?
<Java> PON3: When you receive all those medicines, you feel like death is standing behind you. Waiting.
<berberborscing> Jared hated my school so much he layed out an elaborated bombing
<berberborscing> in the cafe
*LadyCanary yawns.
<berberborscing> He was caught by an officer
<P0N3> Well Java I imagine you do until they kick in.
<J_E_Smith71> Depends on my own funds
<P0N3> I'm surprised we don't see more geriatric streaking.
<P0N3> When I have my old-age meds, I might.
<berberborscing> He is now sentenced to 15 years of prison, starting Dec. 5th
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: you and me both
<Drew> Does anyone know what editor he's using?
<RaveBrony> O_o
<soulrider95> I have to take anti-psychosis pills :<
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to compensate for being old by also being adorably insane
<Java> PON3: I don't want to see a geriatric running around naked while yelling YOLO or something.
<P0N3> Yeah fortunately most of those kinds of kids are stupid and get caught, Berberborscing.
<RaveBrony> My great grandmother is awesomely insane.
<Java> berberborscing: At least he's in prison serving time.
<LadyCanary> I think it's time for me to head to sleep.
<Saturn> 08,01speaking of being old, my dad is 65, and he's way more of a gamer than i am. i caught him helling "take that, noob" on CoD the other day
<Java> Justice is served.
<P0N3> I'll be like one of the golden-girls, except less well adjusted and listening to dubstep.:D
<berberborscing> My mom said "Can't wait until college. That's the best years of your life!"
<Saturn> 08,01*yelling
<LadyCanary> Thank you for streaming Wrek <3 wub. And happy new year to all!
<Java> berberborscing: It is!
<Saturn> 08,01i was so proud
<RaveBrony> 97 years old and she beat the crap out of the person who tried to help her up after she fell over... then offered him candy like nothing happened not 2 minutes later :D
<Jim> hah, my dad is like 58, and he doesn't know how a computer works
<Saturn> 08,01i jsut hope he never find 4chan
<Ninjazz> That's not beinga gamer, Saturn. That's being a kid again.
<P0N3> Saturn, how are you going to react if your dad becomes a brony?
<Java> My high school suck. My college tears are fun
<Java> years
<Saturn> 08,01Jim: my dad helped invent the floppy drive
<Drew> :o
<Jim> Saturn, That's freaking awesome
<Java> the dirve or the floppy? ;)
<P0N3> Raver, muggers sometimes underestimate old folks with hilarious results.
<berberborscing> Which eventually evolved into the CD
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: it would be out of character for him, but i'd be so proud
<P0N3> These are guys who went to war. THey know how to fight fast and hard.
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, i don't think it's his thing
<berberborscing> My brother felt bad for me paying for all his food at the mall the other day, so he made me cookies and milk ^^
<P0N3> And a lot of the old ladies can fight too.
<berberborscing> He went to Blondie's cookies and the Candy barrel so... yeah
<Java> old ladies mud wrestling?
<Saturn> 08,01heh, Spartacus: Blood and Sand was on TV the other day, and he *loves* Roman fiction, so he was all prepped to watch the hell out of it
<RaveBrony> P0N3: Lol, it wasnt a mugger though, it was a paramedic :D
<Saturn> 08,01i didn't tell him that it was pretty much mostly gay sex.
<P0N3> Wow. That would sure be a thing to see, Java.
<P0N3> You would never unsee that.
<RaveBrony> Thats what makes it so great.
<Java> lel
<Saturn> 08,01Java: i've seen that
<Saturn> 08,01it was hilarious
<Java> haahahahahaha
<Saturn> 08,01daftest bunch of old ladies i've ever met
<berberborscing> You know what are horrible?
<berberborscing> Pony Thread Simulators
<P0N3> Wasn't the Greek army mostly made of gay couples?
<P0N3> They would fight together naked or something.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Saturn> 08,01pretty much, yeah
<P0N3> I mean like in ancient ancient days.
<berberborscing> socker ad
<Saturn> 08,01ah, i could do with something naked, greek, and very, very male right now
<Saturn> 08,01muscly.
<berberborscing> lol
<Saturn> 08,01*muscley.
<P0N3> Greek guys sure don't look like those statues. The statues always look like Mr. Universe, but when I see a Greek guy he's always this big burly hairy guy.
<berberborscing> u spelled it rite before
<P0N3> What happened there.
<Saturn> 08,01oh, okay
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: yeah, not that kind
<Saturn> 08,01but i've seen plenty of hot greeks
<Java> I remember an "ask me I answer" session with a bored Greek soldier on the Greece and Turkey border. He said Turkey soldiers love to troll Greek soldiers by deliberately crossing the border.
<Saturn> 08,01mostly in my mind.
<berberborscing> When I saw a pony thread simulator, I heard the disgusting things people said
<Wrek> 05thats the hoof
<Wrek> 05now imgagine all of her liek that
<P0N3> I admittedly haven't seen many Greeks, that I know of.
<Saturn> 08,01speeking of hot greeks
<Saturn> 08,01evein' wrek
<Wrek> 05hello there saturn
<P0N3> Lol I love pony thread simulators. :D
<Saturn> 08,01what the hell is a Hufflepuff?
<berberborscing> they're so hilarious and disturbing at the same time
<Java> Harry Potter?
<Saturn> 08,01er, i mean, Pony Thread Simulator (PTS)?
<berberborscing> I wont bother with a link during stream
<berberborscing> Anyway, people talk about topics
<berberborscing> Mostly, and almost always about cumming everywhere on horses
<RaveBrony> Woah! Woah
<Jim> Oh the internet
<Jmo> Oi berberborscing, move on.
<berberborscing> and they say dumb shit that is also hilarious
<RaveBrony> ^
<P0N3> Yeah, there's stuff like ">You find yourself in Equestria. >Rainbow Dash's funeral. >Too late, you've already crashed it. >Wat do" Every time at least one person says "Rape."
<P0N3> No matter what the scenario.
<MissVenom> sad 'cuz its true
<RaveBrony> Moving onnnnnnn
<berberborscing> I cant
<berberborscing> Ill be kicked
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 Shizuka actually was planning on cleaning that
<Shizuka> 13:P
<RaveBrony> How about..... uh....games?
<RaveBrony> Games are fun
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but can't join
<Shizuka> 13that's what we've been doing
<Wrek> 05oh and yay im considered hot
<berberborscing> I want Forza 4...
<Wrek> 05:o
<GabeMoist> I feel like I just missed something important
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it is
<Saturn> 08,01of course you're considered hot
<berberborscing> Nothing too important.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and i am
<RaveBrony> Hmm?
<P0N3> I'm not hot, I'm 'cute'. I HATE being cute.
<berberborscing> I want a pet parakeet.
<P0N3> It's like being hot but without getting any respect.
<Saturn> 08,01you're like this hot, cute little Thor
<Saturn> 08,01with glasses
<Panda> O_o
<Panda> what did I come back to
<thelonecubone|GoW3> RaveBrony: doing the beast mode atm
<GabeMoist> Saturn, pics?
<RaveBrony> Im a straight male, so my opinion is biased :D
<berberborscing> youre lucky u missed sumthing
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: i actually do have some somewhere
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm looking for the the older versions Shizu seems like i need to downgrade like 5 mods to join
<Saturn> 08,01but he has clothes on in almost all of them.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Shizuka> 13sec i'll get you the mediafire link to my multimc instance
<Ninjazz> >almost
<P0N3> I'm listening to these people outside who are smoking the pot. I'm not sure what nationality they are. Either Punjabi or Egyptian.
<P0N3> I can't tell.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> multimc ?
<berberborscing> Either you're hot or you're not
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: quite a broad sweep there
<P0N3> Raver, it's okay for a guy to think another guy is attractive.
<P0N3> That doesn't mean he wants to do him.
<Shizuka> 13better launcher, maintains instances of minecraft with different mods or versions
<P0N3> It just means he recognizes another guy is hot.
<Java> Are you sure PON3? there are tons of langfuage in Asia.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kk
<RaveBrony> Ill say a guy looks good, I wont say hes hot :D
<P0N3> I dunno it sounds pretty middle eastern.
<berberborscing> when im bored i feel like doing this. " "
<P0N3> Actually I think they're Armenian. Or Israeli.
<Java> PON3: There are almost 100 active languages in my country alone (and 1 national language) so I don't judge so easily
<berberborscing> Chewing cookie to the rhythm of this song
<P0N3> Wow what country?
<Java> Indonesia
<P0N3> Oh cool. How are things there?
<berberborscing> Indianapolis
<P0N3> It's cool how there's bronies all over the globe.
<berberborscing> Nope, im in florida.
<Java> Good mostly, but the petroleum price are problematic
<Saturn> 08,01P0N3: i think by now all we can be fairly certain of, going by your description, is that they're from somewhere in one of the "brown regions" of planet earth.
<berberborscing> America: Easy, take it from Saudi Arabia
<MissVenom> woo another floridian
<P0N3> I stand by Israeli. Pretty sure.
<P0N3> I don't understand the language, but pretty sure about the accent.
<RaveBrony> I was a Floridian for 17 years, sooo, I stil consider myself one :3
<Jim> Hmm, time to go to bed, it's almost 7 am
<Saturn> 08,01i really want to go and visit Damascus
<P0N3> And honestly, most of the regions of the world have brown people. Caucasians are a minority.
<Jim> G'night folks!
<berberborscing> Bro hoof if you're floridian! /)
<Saturn> 08,01but... i don't want to be killed
<Wrek> 05bronies can appreciate this song
<RaveBrony> Been in NY for 1 yeah and a half now tho
<Wrek> 05shoot her to the moon
<thelonecubone|GoW3> Night Jim :)
<MissVenom> hehe ive been in florida my whole live, so ya hehe
<P0N3> So, what's the crime like in Indonesia?
<RaveBrony> Cya Jim! Good seeing ya!
<Java> Saturn: Don't worry to much. It's not like everyone want to shoot every visitors
<MissVenom> life*
<berberborscing> Crime in the US is worse usually.
<P0N3> Canada can actually be pretty bad. Especially Toronto, Vancouver.
<P0N3> This is why I don't live on the mainland.
<berberborscing> Let's all move to Greenland!
<berberborscing> It'll be nation of the bronies
<P0N3> Yay! Let's move to Greenland and freeze our asses off!
<Java> PON3: Well, I heard there's a Maple Syrup Cartel out there. And the smuggling of 20 million dollars worth of Maple Syrup....
<Saturn> 08,01Java: i suppose it helps that i am actually brown
<Saturn> 08,01or at least, i'm brown until i open my mouth
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Wrek> 05brown mute
<Java> Saturn: relax and enjoy your visit.
<Saturn> 08,01then i'm very white, but with the wrong colour skin
<Wrek> 05with sunglasses
<P0N3> Java, you'd be surprised how much drug traffic comes through Canada.
<Java> Thru Russia?
<P0N3> From all over the world, I guess.
<berberborscing> Russia made my favorite sports car :(
<Java> I see
<P0N3> And it trickles into the US through our leaky border.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> O_o what?
<Java> Maybe TSA is getting problematic.
<Java> Hey, TSA actually helpful for once?
<P0N3> Plus all this Canadian pot.
<Saturn> 08,01considering the British Embassy have withdrawn from Syria...
<P0N3> It's our largest crop next to wheat.
<Saturn> 08,01i don't think it would be a good idea for me to go there
<berberborscing> Phase4 is best pony
<GabeMoist> Saturn, become the new British embassy
<Java> Saturn: Go to Bali (lol self promotion)
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: i'll be the first Scottish Embassy in Syria!
<berberborscing> You don't want to go to GreenLand? Well, is it gonna be Antarctica or Easter Island?
<Java> Saturn: What's you main import to Syria then?
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Saturn> 08,01Java: love.
<Java> Kilts?
<Java> Awwwww
<P0N3> People in the US, your DHS is really scaring me. What's with them buying tanks and all that hollowpoint ammunition?
<P0N3> That is just FREAKY.
*Java hug Saturn
<berberborscing> M yonly weapon is a bow.
<Saturn> 08,01what's hollowpoint used for?
<RaveBrony> I want a kilt....
<thelonecubone|GoW3> percing skin
<P0N3> THey're bullets that blow up!
<Saturn> 08,01get a kilt, then
<MirrorImage> P0N3 - stockpiling before everything gets so heavily regulated because of the recent stuff that's been happening, i'm sure
<P0N3> And blow chunks out of things!
*Saturn 08,01hugs Java back
<Java> I want to try kilt, but I afraid getting boner when I wear one
<berberborscing> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<thelonecubone|GoW3> P0N3: naw, thats Incenerary
<RaveBrony> If you got it, flaunt it! :D
<Saturn> 08,01bitch, i just know you didn't post a non-image link during a stream.
<P0N3> Hollowpoint bullets shatter.
<Wrek> 05there you go saturn
<Wrek> 05check stream
<berberborscing> It's not a video
<P0N3> And mushroom out, causing a ton of damage.
<Saturn> 08,01gimme a sec, wrek
<Java> Hollowpoint hurt more.
<Java> :(
<MirrorImage> Saturn - the gist of a hollowpoint is that it turns into shrapnel once it enters the body
<RoboGerbil> hollow point rounds fragment on hit causing considerably more organ damage than normal slugs
<thelonecubone|GoW3> P0N3: ah, now i see
<Java> I hate hollowpoint.
<Saturn> 08,01okay...
<Java> too cruel
<thelonecubone|GoW3> I always thought it was to peirce skin all the time :P
<Saturn> 08,01that's quite nasty
<berberborscing> I'm afraid Saturn hates me
<Saturn> 08,01so basically, hollowpoint is the "you're fucked now, laddie" round.
<MirrorImage> basically
<RaveBrony> Yup
<Java> World War 4 we will fight with stick and stones. That's what Einstein said.
<Wrek> 05its very effective agaistn unarmored targest
<Wrek> 05ts*
<Ninjazz> Unless you're wearing kevlar.
<Saturn> 08,01berberborscing: i don't hate you, i just hate that you're disregarding our rules
<MirrorImage> think Tony Stark + Jericho
<pony64> hello guys
<P0N3> And how come in the USA there's always someone going nuts and shooting someplace up?
<Saturn> 08,01pony64: and girls?
<Ninjazz> But chances are you'll be wearing normal clothes, so yes you're screwed.
<berberborscing> what about the bullets that pierce through tanks like tissue paper?
<pony64> true saturn
<RoboGerbil> Saturn: not really, any kind of kevlar works well against howlow points because they shatter so easily
<MirrorImage> berberborscing - those are exact opposite. they're a solid chunk of metal
<Wrek> 05anotehr example
<MirrorImage> they'll make a nice clean hole
<Java> berberborscing: There's no such thing as bullet that can pierce metal that easily.
<Wrek> 052nd is hollowpoint
<pony64> while ur here, you guys should tune into celestia Radio, they are doin a new years day top pony song countdown, just wanted to spread the news
<berberborscing> Watch the video called "SCP 096"
<berberborscing> Not videogame, real life
<P0N3> Java, there are some .50 bullets that can make a pretty neat hole in armour plate.
<P0N3> I don't remember what they're made from though.
<flutterchu> Hello everyone
<pony64> hello
<MirrorImage> P0N3 - in all fairness, that's a 50-cal
<Java> I know, but direct hit. Not angled hit.
<P0N3> Yeah.
<P0N3> Some sort of ceramic composite I think.
<berberborscing> The title is just SCP 096. Nothing else
<P0N3> Or a 3Dp alloy.
<flutterchu> http://images.wikia.com/battlefordreamislandfanfiction/images/f/f3/Book.png
<Java> Most tanks nowadays are angled to deflect bullets.
<Java> armours
<otakon> well taht's a given
<otakon> the armor is designed that way to deflect and absorb, common design really
<P0N3> Hee hee remember those gimmickey corner-shots?
<berberborscing> A bullet, but not from any gun. From a gun so large it's considered a building
<otakon> anyway where is RX when you need him?
<Java> Revolver Ocelot?
<Jmo> Yes cause this is clearly the chat to ask otakon.
<otakon> Jmo: quiet Marsupial
<SpeccyRush> like half of the children here know who RX is otakon
<Wrek> 05who?
<berberborscing> only rx i know is Mazda RX7 AND 8
<Java> berberborscing: A gun so large, it's become inefficient to use or move around.
<tackeart> Oh, why hello there everybody.
<Java> hello tackeart
<otakon> Wrek: Sweetibot, aka Savage Grimlock, aka RX-78 Sweetiebot
<otakon> the gunsmith
<berberborscing> It launches ICBMs, and SCP 096 was a fucked up human not showing pain from any gun bullets
<otakon> 096?
<tackeart> So what's going on in the stream right now?
*otakon goes to SCP
<berberborscing> This ICBM hit him and was split in hjalf at the torso
<Wrek> 05168
<otakon> tackeart: intermission
<berberborscing> But he still was ripping apart his squad.
<tackeart> seems like that.
<Java> I thought they already remove those mary sue SCP like that.
<otakon> oh god THAT THING
<otakon> think Slenderman but nastier and naked
<RaveBrony> Dafuw is that thing?
<tackeart> So are there any streams planning, or is the intermission going to be here for a while?
<Java> Slenderman is naked.
<Java> those aren't his suits.
<The_Engineer> INTERMISSIONNNNNNNNNN
<P0N3> What's the bad-guy equivalent of a Mary Sue?
<flutterchu> bloo and cream son
<Java> Is there one?
<pony64> Mary poo?
<berberborscing> They say SCP 096 is agitated and goes into severe emotional distress when someone looks at his face directly, video recording, or even photograph
<P0N3> The guy who beats all the other characters up so the Mary Sue can show how tough thei are by beating up the bad guy.
<Wrek> 05meh
<berberborscing> Then he chases them until they die
<Wrek> 05the thign from ao oni is worse
<pony64> evil mary sue is the jocker from batman
<flutterchu> wow, i have uploaded, 100 pictures, on the BFDI fanfiction wiki (:
<Wrek> 05also
<Java> Do we have Pony fanfic but with sudden bad ending in the end?
<tackeart> What's the music, anyway?
<berberborscing> His speed is at least 35 km/h to (not permitted to show)
<pony64> dat piC@!!!!
<pony64> ew
<berberborscing> It varies on his distance
<The_Engineer> QW9ER0YFHA8OEuidfrwyg
<flutterchu> uhhhhhhh
<The_Engineer> what the fuck did i just see
<flutterchu> i dont want to see that again
<pony64> the end.
<berberborscing> What did you see?
<P0N3> What did you guys see? I was distracted by something adorable.
<tackeart> ^
<The_Engineer> a pinkie pie
<Wrek> 05they saw scp 168 but as pinkie pie
<berberborscing> lol
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> The joy of taking things apart to fic them is gone
<RaveBrony> I mustve lagged
<flutterchu> what the heck is scp 168?
<RaveBrony> I dont know :(
<tackeart> oh hey, the stream is starting again.
<Wrek> 05google is your friend
<tackeart> Listen to @Wrek.
<The_Engineer> Google sucks balls
<P0N3> Okay Op! Let's see if you can find a picture of... Pinkie Pie in a bikini.
<RaveBrony> I did just google it, it showed me guns :I
<The_Engineer> we cant rate youtube 1-5 because of google
<thelonecubone|GoW3> RaveBrony: check youtube
<RaveBrony> More pony??
<tackeart> DRAGON QUEST
<RaveBrony> What is this madness????
<otakon> moar pony!
<Java> I think Like Dislike already exist before google acquisition
<berberborscing> AD NOOOO
<RaveBrony> MY Fav EP!! <3
<otakon> dat Shy
<P0N3> I like this episode because Rainbow Dash gets stomped.:)
<tackeart> :(
<pony64> o sh**
<tackeart> See, I can't tell the subtle difference between S2 and S3. There's SOMETHING, but it's just niggling at me.
<P0N3> Fatality!
<Java> hahahaha
<flutterchu> I liek this episode because it proves how stupid the MLP wiki is, They said Fluttershy was a BP in this episode :D
<RaveBrony> I still get nothing for 168.... :(
<Java> SCP-168
<Java> there
<berberborscing> Most popular is 173
<RaveBrony> Yeah, nothing :\
<Java> the stair?
<berberborscing> He has a videogame on him
<pony64> them numbers, what do they mean mason!!?
<tackeart> FRAAAANCE
<Wrek> 05my bad
<Kandarihu> Oh, I love this scene
<Wrek> 05173*
<pony64> WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASON
<P0N3> I hate how Fluttershy is back to acting like a little bitch.
<pony64> graaaahhhhh
<RaveBrony> Oooooh, ty Wrek
<tackeart> pony64: SHALL WE ELECTROCUTE YOU AGAIN MASON
<P0N3> That scene with the book was just sad.
<P0N3> When she found the info on the alicorn amulet.
<P0N3> And EVERYONE just ignored her.
<berberborscing> Ill find image of SCP 173.
<otakon> SCP 682
<otakon> that thing is scary as hell
<berberborscing> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110512190444/villains/images/5/5a/173.jpg
<RaveBrony> ._.
<tackeart> Camoflage is SUPPOSED to be drab, Rarity. That's the point, to not be seen in an environment.
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> SCP-087 made me cry
<berberborscing> The scariest one is SCP 106.
<thelonecubone|GoW3> P0N3: she does have to speak up, but it's in her personality, being quiet
<pony64> daaattt piccccc
<P0N3> Rainbow with a camo hat. Heh.
<Wrek> 05there there
<Wrek> 05no more scp
<P0N3> I know, but I still found it disappointing. Fluttershy needs to really finally be more assertive.
<Java> the worst hadaka apron ever
<Java> barf
<RaveBrony> Dafuq is this SCP?
<P0N3> Or she'll go nuts again.
<tackeart> I agree with Wrek, let's just discuss the episode.
<RaveBrony> Ive seen it, but i dont know what it is
<P0N3> God Spike is so whipped.
<berberborscing> SCP is mythology used to make people paranoid
<P0N3> He's so whipped he has no idea.
<berberborscing> Fake stories that are written really fucking well
<Java> berberborscing: Or is it?
<RaveBrony> Dat OOooOOooOO <3
<flutterchu> Rarity: The fasion Freak, AppleJack: The Apple Addiction, Twilight: The Purple Book worm, Fluttershy: The Quiet Beast, Pinkie Pie: The Hyper Pink Cupcake, Rainbow Dash: The Rainbow Rush
<flutterchu> ^fan notifications
<Java> lol waddle
<P0N3> Ponies like, permanently ruined Spike.
<tackeart> flutterchu: Uh..are you listing wrestler names?
<P0N3> He'll never be a real dragon.
<flutterchu> tackeart: nope
<pony64> o mah gosh, u r soo raght
<Java> Identity crisis
<pony64> nope.nope
<berberborscing> I regretted image searching 106.
<Java> Still better than DC timeline.
<tackeart> ^
<P0N3> Twilight's always solution: "We'll do books."
<tackeart> double ^
<pony64> make it double
<berberborscing> triple ^
<Java> Idiot writers ruin DC comics.
<tackeart> Why yes they do, spike.
<DitzyDerpy15> HEY GUYS :3
<pony64> herlo
<J_E_Smith71> Yet Twilight suddenly knows about the dragon code
<tackeart> oL:
<P0N3> "Oh, I know all about that subject! I just read a book, so I'm an expert."
<RaveBrony> J_E_Smith71: Ikr?
<Java> J_E_Smith71: I think Spike made his own "codes
<pony64> or maby she has talked to spike offscreen maby or soemthing
<pony64> lol PON3
<tackeart> P0N3: Sounds like her.
<superretroworld> i love this ep
<flutterchu> Derpy: The Ditzy Dimwit :P
<P0N3> And she's so snarky too.
<Java> Sandvich
<otakon> Spike made his code after this I think
<J_E_Smith71> Java: And also Marvel for certain Spider-Man events
<P0N3> Twilight is adorkable and I like her but I would never ever be able to live iwth her.
<DitzyDerpy15> spike.. wut he doing?
<tackeart> Spike, stop being so derp. Dragons DO end up burning their home village down.
<pony64> she said not today
<tackeart> P0N3: ^^^^ to infinity.
<Java> Clone? the deal with the devil? I wonder what the hell in their mind.
<Java> Spiderman is ruined.
<flutterchu> I realized, Twilight's kinda keeping Spike from growing up XD
<RaveBrony> Dat shto at RD
<tackeart> I'd rather steal Trixie's cart, kick her out, etc.
<RaveBrony> :D
<pony64> "its my money and i need it now"
<RaveBrony> *shot
<superretroworld> raritys so funny
<berberborscing> Now that star wars is owned by disney... let's hope to god for no musicals
<DitzyDerpy15> lolololol
<Wrek> 05i should design a scary game
<berberborscing> No wrek!
<pony64> yes
<P0N3> I couldn't live with Pinkie Pie... I couldn't live with Twilight... I couldn't live with Rarity. Oh god never ever Rarity.
<berberborscing> I play SCP, im paranoid enough!
<DitzyDerpy15> Wrek: That will be fun..
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> Wrek: the simpler the scarier
<Java> berberborscing: Star Wars Christmas Special part 2
<P0N3> Let's see. That leaves Applejack and Fluttershy.
<tackeart> berberborscing: Since they bought Lucasart, AARRGH THEY OWN ALL THE LUCASARTS GAMES.
<Wrek> 05im swedish so its in my blod to be unconditionally sadist
<tackeart> ohai ad
<P0N3> With Fluttershy I would always just feel guilty somehow, like I'm always intruding.
<MirrorImage> P0N3 - but on the bright, side, you'd never have to go clothes shopping again with rarity
<berberborscing> u suk.
<flutterchu> "were following him right?" "HELL YEAH"
<P0N3> So I guess if I had my choice, Applejack.
<Wrek> 05blood*
<CrystalPhoenix> P0N3 what's the matter? You're not civilized?
<pony64> AJ is best poni
<tackeart> Yes, that includes Republic Commando, Grim Fandango, etc.
<Java> beard
<pony64> but maby not best pony
<P0N3> Well that's true MirrorImage but Rarity is also very very OC.
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<anton> fail
<DaringDerpy> ponies?
<CrystalPhoenix> OC?
<DitzyDerpy15> OC WTF
<P0N3> Obsessive compulsive.
<pony64> Orange Carrots
<tackeart> *OCD.
<berberborscing> aj is most important pony. where the hell am i gonna get apples from without her
<pony64> dammit
<P0N3> I'm civilized, but Applejack just seems... well. Comfortable.
<DaringDerpy> pish posh
<CrystalPhoenix> Twilight is way more OCD
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity is just clean
<pony64> twilight is ocd pony
<Wrek> 05also http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/319/b/7/containment_breach_by_ridel-d5l2ufg.jpg
<RaveBrony> I couldnt live with anypony, because theyre cartoon characters :I
<P0N3> Imagine if Twilight and Rarity had to share living arrangements for a long period of time.
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<tackeart> P0N3: Fanfiction ensues!
<pony64> theyd porb do fine
<P0N3> Probably already has! :)
<berberborscing> Slenderman IS less scary then SCP now that I think about it
<P0N3> SCP?
<flutterchu> the backround has the same dragon from dragonshy
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> Slenderman is nothing
<tackeart> Slenderman is an egg wearing a suit that gets scared off by saltwater.
<CrystalPhoenix> have you guys played that staircase SCP?
<Meth> So..
<berberborscing> Slenderman is one guy chasing you consistently
<Meth> How is the test?
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> P0N3: Secure Contain Protect
<berberborscing> in SCP, you have 5 different guys to worry about
<tackeart> just run to the ocean and he won't chase you.
<P0N3> Wow never heard of that.
<pony64> lololol
<KrazyNoobs> SCP?
<KrazyNoobs> SCARY
<berberborscing> 173 teleports.
<DitzyDerpy15> SCP YEAH
<tackeart> either that, or trap him and dump him into the ocean.
<CrystalPhoenix> there's tons of SCP
<KrazyNoobs> AHAAHAHA
<berberborscing> 106 can walk through walls.
<RaveBrony> THis ep is great
<flutterchu> who 146
<Spyrorocks> went well.
<pony64> 117 can kill grunts
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> this is one of my least favorite episodes
<berberborscing> there are 10 scps in game but half of them are harmless machines
<CrystalPhoenix> Crackle's cousin is best pony
<Kandarihu> Hmm, Peewee
<P0N3> >Spike falls in with a group of dragon teenagers >Thinks they're representative of dragons as a whole.
<RaveBrony> Awesome Blue flame
<tackeart> All of them can be killed by the dev console.
<tackeart> P0N3: Spike is idiotic like that.
<berberborscing> 420-J cannot
<berberborscing> He;s the guy that looks like weed on the floor
<MissVenom> Well thats it for me. Night Everypony :)
<KrazyNoobs> It is scary because for most of the time, you are going further and further down, and you get used to it, and suddenly, !!!
<flutterchu> I have favorites, but i can watch ANY episode, exept The Season 2 premere
<pony64> gnight dude
<tackeart> KrazyNoobs: *MGS alarm sound*
<DaringDerpy> twilight...
<superretroworld> flutterchu: thank you
<tackeart> g'night, venom
<P0N3> That was Princess Celestia inviting Twilight to her birthday.
<P0N3> She doesn't go.
<berberborscing> Notice how you don't blink in Slender.
<RaveBrony> Cya MissVenom
<SlenderManWoods> winner
<tackeart> P0N3: Celestia seems to be forever alone.
<tackeart> wat
<P0N3> Lol.:)
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> berberborscing: blinking wasnt relevant in slender
<pony64> ew
<RaveBrony> Crackleeeee
<P0N3> Naah I'm sure Princess Celestia is where most of the stallions went.
<berberborscing> SCP invented blinking just so 173 could rape you faster
<SlenderManWoods> cracle, cute
<P0N3> She hoards them.
<CrystalPhoenix> Crackle is best dragon
<DerpyDitzy15|BackWar> ..
<Meth> cool
<sonicdude558> Good night guys :)
<tackeart> I mean, all her loved ones are dying one by one, and Celestia is slowly starting to make bad decisions more and more.
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> night sonicdude558
<RaveBrony> Cya sonicdude558
<P0N3> Nite nite Sonic.
<RaveBrony> Owwww
<tackeart> Nite, sonicdude.
<flutterchu> my favorite episode is Season 2, episode 23, because it's the fist episode ive ever watched, but not the first Pony video ive ever seen
<SlenderManWoods> night sonic
<P0N3> The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Princess Celestia.
<sonicdude558> I got trolled 2 times in a pony TF2 server
<pony64> dat tail
<Kandarihu> Oh boy. That letter is probably relavent to the wedding between Shining Armor and Princess Cadence.
<DaringDerpy> celestia has the whole royal guard to play with
<DaringDerpy> and the elements
<tackeart> P0N3: She [i]is[/i] pretty much going insane from all these deaths.
<P0N3> Daring, I bet they're all gelded.
<tackeart> aw, no italics.
<sonicdude558> meh, I am going to stay up past by bread time
<berberborscing> SCP 173 is in GMod, but no matter how far away he is he teleports right in fucking front of you!
<tackeart> *halo jokes*
<pony64> right now is about soup time not quite bread time
<P0N3> I dunno Tackeart, I think after a few thousand years you'd probably adjust.
<RaveBrony> Fail
<SlenderManWoods> fail
<tackeart> I think she's just making worse and worse decisions by now.
<berberborscing> My dream has been to be in one of those bronystate new episode explosion videos
<superretroworld> why does it keep skipping?
<DerpyDitzy15|BackWar> I am ganna lrer
<SlenderManWoods> ya, lava splash, not dangerous at all
<tackeart> I'd make a remark about Spyro the Dragon dying from lava, but..
<P0N3> She's going through that awkward "just wants to be one of the girls' phase. Again. Probably happens every couple hundred years.
<Meth> Do you think the owner of MLP would like u streaming MLP?
<SlenderManWoods> yep
<tackeart> P0N3: Yeah, but still making dumber and dumber decisions by now.
<berberborscing> Bellyflop = burned even if water is cold
<anton> i wonder what it would be like to swim in lava without burning or melting to death
<berberborscing> Bellyflop into lava = holy motherfucking shit
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> be pretty hard to swim in lava
<Spyrorocks> dont think they care.
<tackeart> atnon: Pleasantly warm.
<Meth> oh
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> considering it's thick as frozen syrup
<SlenderManWoods> tails up
<P0N3> I think it's great how Equestria is so peaceful. But I don't think they're prepared at all for any kind of catastrophic invasion.
<tackeart> ^
<P0N3> Are ponies really so tough that they have no fear out invasion?
<MirrorImage> Oppa Dragon Style?
<berberborscing> Let's see...
<flutterchu> Dragons should be as powerful as shit to support Lava
<berberborscing> Sombra...
<berberborscing> Luna...
<berberborscing> Discord...
<flutterchu> Chrysails
<flutterchu> ....
<P0N3> So yes?
<RaveBrony> Wha?
<tackeart> P0N3: Ponies are natural prey animals, remember?
<P0N3> Sure, but can you imagine how awesome a pony fps would be?
<DaringDerpy> this is a land where ponies exterminated humans
<DitzyDerpy15> FOREVER?!
<berberborscing> They're also prey of an African Rock Python
<flutterchu> Fun Fact: Chrysails is the only villan to sing on MLP FIM
<DaringDerpy> don't underestimate them
<pony64> thats like, 4-evers
<DitzyDerpy15> Kyrospawn's FOREVER?!
<P0N3> Pegasi bombing stuff, unicorns using arcane magic to collapse entire mountainsides, earthpony army with heavy munitions.
<tackeart> Sombra was the one who got closest to actually KILLING the Mane Six.
<tackeart> P0N3: But how do they hold guns without magic?
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> i guess you're gonna miss the panty raid...
<P0N3> Mag- oh, no wait...
<pony64> discord coulda prob killed them if he wanted 2
<P0N3> I dunno, I'm sure you could come up with ways.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, we haven't really seen the military defenses of Equestria much... aside from some stoic guards led by a Unicorn who's really good at force fields.
<tackeart> SLIDE! SLIIDE!
<berberborscing> Ponies don't have fingers, so no guns if they can't even pull the trigger
<anton> its acuactually all there fault for making fun of him for not being like other dragons
<P0N3> Pony mounted miniguns with mouth controls?
<SlenderManWoods> makes sence
<RaveBrony> > Have to hoof it
<P0N3> Use your 'magination! :D
<MirrorImage> berberborscing - prehensile tongue
<RaveBrony> >Shes stanfing on RD back
<pony64> maby Celestia has like 5x as many gaurds but they are under invisibility spells?
<RaveBrony> *standing
<MirrorImage> read more Fallout Equestria
<DaringDerpy> one single alicorn could defend a whole city against a swarm of thousands.
<pony64> invisible anti-griffon missles
<berberborscing> I love birds.
<CrystalPhoenix> Phoenixes <3
<tackeart> DaringDerpy: Basically.
<tackeart> Phoenixes are really good at teleportation, apparently.
<P0N3> Man, a pony - griffon war could be some awesome stuff.
<berberborscing> My friend through a rock at a spider in my face, and I felt bad.
<P0N3> And pony-dragon.
<berberborscing> Then the spider fell onto his face. :)
<DaringDerpy> we've never seen multi alicorn spells so far
<DitzyDerpy15> TEH EGG :P
<RaveBrony> THat makes me want to play WoW again.... and fly around on 'Ashes of Al'ar' :(
<DitzyDerpy15> :O
<J_E_Smith71> Kinda hard when they can go on fire
<SexyIshy> ohai everypony
<P0N3> I like how the phoenixes here just lay down the shit on those dragons.
<anton> never piss off a phoenix
<pony64> hello
<P0N3> Whoops, excuse my language. Sorry.
<DaringDerpy> hi SexyIshy
<DaringDerpy> hi pony64
<tackeart> Pheonixes are immortal, remember?
<flutterchu> OBJECTION
<pony64> well they are kid dragons
<Wrek> 05wonder hwo many forest fires phoenixes have caused
<SlenderManWoods> failed
<berberborscing> Phoenix: the capital of arizona
<tackeart> So even IF the dragons ate them, they'd just immolate the dragons from inside.
<Java> Ten Shin Han move
<pony64> i was already here daring ><
<J_E_Smith71> Moltres used Sunny Day
<pony64> for like an hour
<P0N3> We haven't seen ANYTHING of Pee Wee since this episode!
<tackeart> @Wrek: None, because they psychically control the fire.
<CrystalPhoenix> best rarity moment coming up
<P0N3> I was so looking forward to more phoenix chick in the show.
<flutterchu> did anyone noticed that one of the dragons have hair?
<RaveBrony> Aw, i skipped
<pony64> but hello anyhow
<Kandarihu> Phoenixes are immortal, but they continue to reproduce even though they cannot die.
<SexyIshy> Wrek and thats how Phoenix Arizona got it's name and became a desert
<RaveBrony> Hah
<pony64> so the world is gunna be overpopulated by pheonixes
<Java> flutterchu: Reptiles can have hair too
<berberborscing> Phoenixes can be killed in their egg form I beleive, or their youth when they're not supposed to shed
<flutterchu> Java: name one
<RaveBrony> Epic Rarity moment! <3
<DaringDerpy> lol
<P0N3> They should have just kept the costume on...
<DitzyDerpy15> RUN SPIKE RUN
<DitzyDerpy15> or not
<pony64> oh dam!
<DitzyDerpy15> :D
<Kandarihu> If nothing stops this, this will lead to explosive population growth of the Phoenixes. These dragons might actually be doing the right thing, as tasteless as it may be.
<P0N3> Little fluffy ponies are just not intimidating.
<tackeart> these teen dragons are quite stupid.
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> Oh, rarity <3
<Java> flutterchu: Mostly short hairs though
<pony64> namy-pamby
<DitzyDerpy15> XD
<CrystalPhoenix> Gotta love rarity
<flutterchu> Spike should turn into an Alicorn in season 3

<DaringDerpy> angry rarity is so cute
<P0N3> Spike. Pff nah.
<DitzyDerpy15> RUN XD
<tackeart> Kandarihu: For all we know, they all fly off to some kind of phoenix city.
<RaveBrony> Run Away Little Girl!!! Run away.....
<berberborscing> A world conquered by Phoenixes? This is gonna be Legend of the Guardians all over again...
<P0N3> One of the Cake babies should turn into an alicorn.
<Java> flutterchu: Also I forget the name of the reptile who have hair...
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> Twilight do- oh
<P0N3> But still have petty little baby desires.
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> yeah yo got it
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<tackeart> flutterchu: Call him Mystery Douche, that should work.

<pony64> what if Crysalias is covering ponyville full of changelings slowly one pony at a time?
<tackeart> Pony64: All those green eyes you see in the forest? Yeah, those are all changelings.
<berberborscing> Except in that movie, owls controlled the world...
<DitzyDerpy15> on iPad..
<MirrorImage> Saturn - ...why?

<Java> With friends like that..... sigh
<SlenderManWoods> halloween is my favorite holiday

<Barbetos> little debbies
<Barbetos> so tastey
<P0N3> I think it's funny how Canadians can't compete on Survivor...
<Christian_Carter> What is dis
<P0N3> 'Cuz that's pretty much just camping to us.
<SolarGuardian> This video is cracking me up.
<TackeartTechnical> ^
<Dis> I'm dis
<DitzyDerpy15|GAK> im watching... creepy...creepypastas again... D:
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> i dont know math anymore, this video has removed my math skills
<pony64> lolwtf
<SlenderManWoods> ya, i love the night
<P0N3> If a Canadian went on Survivor, I bet you anything one of the three items they're allowed to bring would be a 6 pack of Molson.
<berberborscing> lol
<Christian_Carter> What happened?
<TackeartTechnical> cyber attacks do not work that way
<pony64> lol
<TackeartTechnical> oh hey, hitman
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> WUT
<pony64> i cant watch this immgunna die
<Java> hahahaha
<berberborscing> This is the reason why Gmod is never used
<Fail> YOLO
<Barbetos> lense flare? glare? wat?
<Fail> fail
<TackeartTechnical> oh, hey faith
<killerpony7733> berberborscing What reason?
<pony64> lol faith
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> WAS THAT
<berberborscing> animation failure
<Fail> FAIL
<Fail> :P
<TackeartTechnical> mirror's edge references, hitman references..
<Java> They killed Faith! assholes!
<Christian_Carter> ...
<pony64> this guy is gunna tell some scary stories
<SlenderManWoods> flesh light, lol
<TackeartTechnical> elmo, stormtroopers..
<killerpony7733> berberborscing You do realise that is the point?. Gmod can make those extremely weird and funny animations and moves. Source film maker is the better overall animation tool and all.
<Barbetos> teh feels
<pony64> this is almost(not really) as sad as sentry
<Christian_Carter> Skyfall 007
<Barbetos> sly coopa
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: TheGreatAndPowerfulT: will take a couple mins to make sure configs and stuff don't mess up
<P0N3> Was that just music from 'UP'?
<berberborscing> someone made a good video with gmod once
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kk shizu
<berberborscing> animation-wise
<TackeartTechnical> killerpony7733: Source Filmmaker is for more serious stuff, GMOD is a more ridiculous style usually used for parodies/humor.
<SlenderManWoods> any more drama, there will be sparkleing vampires
<Christian_Carter> Who watched skyfall 007?
<killerpony7733> TackeartTechnical Yeah that's what i was trying to explain.
<pony64> lol apple computer
<TackeartTechnical> killerpony7733 Ah.
<Barbetos> da hoppa?
<TackeartTechnical> oh, hey jensen
<Shizuka> 13that was easy, it doesn't actually pack config files so those never get overwritten, nice
<Anger> yeah R.I.P
<Christian_Carter> anyone watch skyfall 007
<TackeartTechnical> yaaay humor
<killerpony7733> I never asked for this
<berberborscing> lol how to spin cursor
<TackeartTechnical> what's going on
<pony64> nah but my friend said skyfall is good
<Shizuka> 13takes so long to boot up X3

<TackeartTechnical> pony64: *insta diabeetus*
<P0N3> Is Celestia a swag god?
<pony64> lol
<XAX> ordered 3 large pizza

<XAX> Saturn: sunbutt is best... god
<TackeartTechnical> berberborscing: Coooold...

<P0N3> So seems like a diverse crowd tonight. Where are we all from?
<Saturn> 08,01she's a goddess of Horse Mythology
<P0N3> BC Canada here.
<J_E_Smith71> Thanks for the stream Wrek
<berberborscing> Define what a continent is.
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/Btzke.jpg
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> well, idk what to do next
<KrazyNoobs2> Saturn: If you said she is a god AND a goddess...
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> stay here
<BroPony|DEMOMAN> or sleep
<pony64> its a really big Tom
<TackeartTechnical> @Saturn: It's weird when they use Celestia's name in vain while you can go see her any time you want.
<berberborscing> If only god was sitting in a throne in temple terrace
<TackeartTechnical> Atheists are sure to be nonexistent in Equestria.
<P0N3> If Luna can go into your dreams, it could be potentially embarrassing to have a naughty dream about luna.
<pony64> if only god didnt allow darsouls to be borne
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs2: she is both.
<TackeartTechnical> P0N3: Or it becomes a fanfiction.
<Wrek> 05hope you guise like it
<TackeartTechnical> MOAH APPUL FWITTER?
<P0N3> "Good night, gentle dreamer, prithee- WHAT ART THOU DREAMING! OH OUR EYES!"
<Wrek> 05beats watchign on a soddy small stream window
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: did you do the graining by hand?
<TackeartTechnical> @Wrek: That is some NICE pony.

<berberborscing> where's that gaming spreadsheet of everyone

<berberborscing> I've always wanted to stream
<P0N3> If I could go into peoples dreams I would so totally abuse that.
<pony64> I would make people dream they had the power to go into dreams
<berberborscing> Dream Powerception
<P0N3> I would wait until someone had a dream about their mom, then next dream i would be with them as their fantsy partner and turn into their mom (or dad) halfway through.
<Barbetos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-s3MGU_76k
<Barbetos> lol
<TackeartTechnical> Five bucks that Luna ends up going into Celestia's dreams and chatting with her.

<JRP2234|Ghost> SuperBrony64
<JRP2234|Ghost> hmm
<otakon> okay all I'm out
<otakon> need sleep, bbl
<pony64> ok cya
<otakon> take care
<JRP2234> UMM
<SlenderManWoods> bye
<P0N3> So I have an important question for you guys.
<JRP2234> WHERE IS MY GOD DAMN one BUTTON
<P0N3> If they were real...
<P0N3> Who would get a fluffy pony and give it lots of love and sketties?
<pony64> sketties?
<SlenderManWoods> i best go for the night
<P0N3> Yeah spaghetti.
<P0N3> Apparently fluffy ponies looove spaghetti.
<SlenderManWoods> bye guys
<pony64> whenever i read spaghetti i think of mario saying it
<P0N3> That would come in handy for me because of all the pocket pasta I drop when I buy ponies at the toy store.
<pony64> cya duude
<pony64> pocket pasta...
<P0N3> Nini Slender.
<pony64> dont know if you guys'll like it but i think this is kinda catchy
<pony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZo1p3YfR-g&list=UUI51O-JgWkh8QRjJQ9ozzrQ
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15oyce/in_50_years_time_what_do_you_think_will_be_the/c7oh90r
<P0N3> For the record I would totally have a fluffy pony.
<P0N3> And give it lots of nummies and hugs.
<TackeartTechnical> ^
<TackeartTechnical> Just give it a lifejacket.
<J_E_Smith71> Night folks
<pony64> I don't even get the question
<pony64> night man
<TackeartTechnical> nite, j
<aniderp|bestcakeever> -yawns-
<Java> pony64: Sounds good, like the old mix
<pony64> :)
<TackeartTechnical> pony64: That is an awesome mix.
<pony64> i know, surpised its so not-wellknown
<P0N3> >Fluffy pony is playing in the living room. >Time to water your plants. You water the plants, fluffy pony chases her ball. >You pull out the spray bottle, and begin misting the house plants. >Fluffy pony drowns.
<Java> pony64: It's your job to submit it to ED.
<pony64> EQD? but its not even mai video
<Java> Well, that's the point right? fans who submit the video. Not uploader.
<TackeartTechnical> P0N3: And THAT is why you give them scuba gear and supply it using whatever is inside their fur.
<pony64> o ok
<P0N3> Scuba gear is expensive. Fluffy ponies are like ten bucks each.
<TackeartTechnical> So give them a gas mask or something.
<pony64> never submitted anything to EQD but gunna do it i guess
<TackeartTechnical> or a helmet.
<P0N3> Hee hee, well, I doubt they'd drown very easily, but I have to agree with the helmet.
<P0N3> Might be a good idea.
<P0N3> There's actually a dog named Bizkit who wears a helmet.
<P0N3> He gets up when he's sleeping and runs into walls.
<TackeartTechnical> I wonder how feasible just giving them better lungs would be.
<P0N3> His helmet has "Sleepwalking Bizkit" painted on it.
<TackeartTechnical> modern science can provide what you need, we'll find the answer
<JRP2234> pony64 i did but the ass hat woulden post it
<TackeartTechnical> ALTERNATELY... What nature has neglected, the fruits of modern﻿ science shall provide..
<P0N3> In my headcanon, fluffies are the earliest ancestor of proper Equestrian ponies.
<pony64> well he cant just post everything
<JRP2234> but it was a song
<pony64> what video did you put in?
<pony64> o, song bleh
<P0N3> After the weak and stupid fluffies are thinned out of feral herds and they figure out puffing their cheeks up doesn't scare predators, they start to actually survive.
<P0N3> And slowly evolve.
<TackeartTechnical> P0N3: Tell the puffing cheeks part to guinea pigs, considering they still do that.
<JRP2234> time to play metroid prime for the interwebz people

<pony64> Applejack = Commander Shephard's favorite pony in all of equestria
<Spell-of-Gaming> I could drive to another Samsung Galaxy Tab in a Tweety bird and dropping by for ponies every 10 seconds and then come back and drag Pop Star to Earth and go back to that planet and bring an enemy and I don't know what I'm writing and reading at the same time.
<JRP2234> ohia SuperBrony64

<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think mutes are available for single users
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I just want to know what movies were picked because quality of movies have gone down recently
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wait, what mute are we talking about?
<CrystalPhoenix> >Wall-E
<pony64> why everyone keep saying hi to this guy but i dont see him saying anything..??? is my internet poopig?
<CrystalPhoenix> >down quality

<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 y u quiet now
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I mean the ones coming up
<pony64> o ok nvm
<pony64> mai bad
<Spell-of-Gaming> Of all the Pixar movies, why Wall-E
<pony64> wall-e was one of my favorites
<CrystalPhoenix> Wall-E is still a good Pixar movie
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> but still old
<pony64> just behind Up and monsters inc
<pony64> i want to sea Brave, not sure if pixar but want to see it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I mean... where is Pirates of Caribbean On stranger tides
<CrystalPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, we've watched 12 angry men before
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> etc.
<pony64> also anyone seen The Hobbit it twas amazinnnggg
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yes
<pony64> bilbo is coolest character
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did you just say....
<berberborscing> http://atom.smasher.org/error/
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> oh... wait.. you didn't
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im fine now
<newlifer> Hi everypony! ^_^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Special Pokemon announcement on the 8th of Januray
<pony64> heylo
<Spell-of-Gaming> IIRC
<CrystalPhoenix> I would like to discuss about The Hobbit but I fear I won't gain anything from it at the current moment
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai newlifer
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what movies for Jan. 4 /5
<CrystalPhoenix> also I'm not one that enjoy giving out spoilers
<pony64> ok yea lets not then
<CrystalPhoenix> Topgun
<CrystalPhoenix> aaaaand
<SpeccyRush> Weird Science
<Spell-of-Gaming> Probably the Ruby and Sapphire remakes
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> as for ponies.....
<pony64> Ponymon
<CrystalPhoenix> can't remember
<pony64> lol
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 1. Weird Science is an A movie.... and 2. We watched Top Gun... it was called Wonderbolt academy
<pony64> herg
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Weird Science > Top Gun
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> unless its the pony version with Spitfire and Soarin
<CrystalPhoenix> that's nice SeaponiesofLiverpool
<CrystalPhoenix> care to keep your opinions for yourself?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> but as I said, quality of movies have plummetted here
<berberborscing> holy shit there's fleas all over me... damn cats
<Spell-of-Gaming> SuperBrony64:
<pony64> is not here?
<pony64> i need some PINGAS and sleeps
<pony64> ill cya guys later imma go watch some anime or something
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Maybe we should make a pool of movies, chosen before hoof. and then the newsletter ponies pick which A and B they want most
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like what's done with the episodes kinda
<pony64> ^im liking this idea
<pony64> for serious
<Spell-of-Gaming> Doesn't seem right.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some movies just need to shine.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that way newer movies can be added to pool
<Pinkies4thWall> I AM RELEVANT
<pony64> maby only on not important days
<Pinkies4thWall> Also, hai
<CrystalPhoenix> Yeah and we
<berberborscing> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/25252270.jpg
<pony64> hello
<CrystalPhoenix> we'll get the same movies over and over again
<Pinkies4thWall> Ooh. Fiery.
<CrystalPhoenix> there's tons of movies out there
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> when was the last time a movie from 2011 was shown?
<pony64> hrm maby just have rules that say: do not use same movie 2 weeks in a row??
<CrystalPhoenix> we can't put every single movies in a single pool
*Pinkies4thWall hugs CrystalPhoenix
<pony64> if admins could agree to something liek that
<CrystalPhoenix> How there
<Spell-of-Gaming> Admins are lurking. Right now.
<CrystalPhoenix> pony64, we have that
<pony64> no idea just putting it out there
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I mean like voting on a pool from the chat or something...
<pony64> >.> just sayin
<berberborscing> Say "YYAAAAEEEHHH" if you are spying on us.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's called do not use the movie that was shown in the span of 6 months
<pony64> YEAEAAAH, wait not enouf h's
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like hey guys... FLIGHT OF DRAGONS is a cool movie! we should add it to the pool
<pony64> thats cool
<Pinkies4thWall> berberborscing: but that would defeat the point of lurking.
<CrystalPhoenix> the system is fine
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> winners should not be able to win again in 6 months
<berberborscing> Pinkies4thWall: We should watch Unico's Adventures on the stream
<pony64> ok only been here for like 2 weeks so i wouldnt really know
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm pretty sure a lot of us have different choices
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> or at least 2 or 3
*JRP2234 hugs SuperBrony64 with a pillow
<CrystalPhoenix> though I do admit I sense a bit of rigging behind
<pony64> you guys arnt refering to me are you?
<berberborscing> pony64:JRP stop hitting him with a pillow
<CrystalPhoenix> but still the system is fine without that factor
<JRP2234> but
<JRP2234> i was just huging
<pony64> you guys, i aint superbrony
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I sense some results are rigged a little bit in people's favor
<JRP2234> :<
<berberborscing> Use this trout instead!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and that's stopping newer movies from getting shown
<CrystalPhoenix> nonsense
<CrystalPhoenix> we had How to Train your dragon not too long ago
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I once suggested Pirate OST and they said it was too new.... and it was released on DVD in 2011
<berberborscing> I crushed a flea in my hand, then i opened my hand. That bastard wasn't even there anymore.
<CrystalPhoenix> still new
<pony64> is it illigal to air newish movies here?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> HTTYD is 2010
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 2 years old
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> and
<pony64> cause this is non-profit so it shouldnt be right?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> newish movies = not out on DVD yet
<pony64> o ok
<CrystalPhoenix> To be honest
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> if its out on DVD it should be okay to be shown
<CrystalPhoenix> they never specified their new movie rule
<pony64> oki
<pony64> play the Hobbit :P
<twilight_sprinkle> http://willis96.deviantart.com/art/Is-This-How-You-Treat-a-Fever-345550282
<pony64> just kidding
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> okay... the Hobbit
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 1970s animated version
<pony64> werdup sprinkle
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> *wink*
<pony64> poopi
<pony64> plays shakespear and such on april first
<CrystalPhoenix> ubt seriously your only concern is that newer movies aren't shown
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have to go back to school on January 3. :I
<pony64> me too T~T
<CrystalPhoenix> or you don't agree in their definition of new movies
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Thehobbit1977cover.png
<pony64> NO!(ytp NO)
<CrystalPhoenix> why thinking of a whole new system if it'll have the same problem
<twilight_sprinkle> for flutterans http://awsdemlp.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Fluttershy-345558590
<pony64> I'm lost, but I don't care
<NocturnalBlade> ok...finally back :|
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I think just extending how long a winner can't double win would help
<Spell-of-Gaming> Anyone who has Windows 8 already?
<berberborscing> I'm happy that's not what my brothers do when I'm sick.
<CrystalPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, no it won't
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> because the same people seem to keep winning
<berberborscing> When I'm sick, they still have their fat asses on their Pc.
<CrystalPhoenix> now you change your complaint
<pony64> anyone who has windows 8 has a poor internet fate
<CrystalPhoenix> stick to one problem if you want to solve it
<pony64> ryhme time on accident try
<Spell-of-Gaming> >Windows 8
<Spell-of-Gaming> >Poor Internet Fate
<twilight_sprinkle> berberborscing: which is worse?:P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> well I suggested Pirates OST, and I THINK they fixed it, but not sure
<Spell-of-Gaming> Have you even tried Windows 8 yet?
*Pinkies4thWall hugs twilight_sprinkle
<berberborscing> Little kids being surgeons. Definitely.
<CrystalPhoenix> fix what exactly?
*twilight_sprinkle hugs Pinkies4thWall back :3
<pony64> ive herd rumors that its bad which means it MUST be absolutely horrid!
<Pinkies4thWall> Friendship is the tits.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> well the movie was in no way a new movie
<CrystalPhoenix> they still decide in the end if the movie is ok to be streamed or not
<Spell-of-Gaming> >implying the rumors are true
<CrystalPhoenix> you're not in power to decide that
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> but the lottery list considered it (wrongly) a new movie
<CrystalPhoenix> they stream what they feel is safe
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: me thinks hes being sarcastic
<berberborscing> A message to Windows: Stop fucking updating your software, I keep having to buy new OS that look the same
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it had been released on DVD for over a year
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> not a new movie
<CrystalPhoenix> guess what, it's not automatic THEY decide from THEIR head whether it's new or not
<pony64> message to Apple:.... fuc i got nothin
<CrystalPhoenix> complain to the mods
<pony64> you guys are asswholes whut else?
<CrystalPhoenix> not the system
<pony64> (meant to apple/mac)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Because Metro UI is TOTALLY the same as the Start Menu.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes the chat just needs to be ded.
<berberborscing> Windows 8: Hey, you get to look at low quality videos in 1080 pixels now, but it's still blurry as fuck because this guy's camera sucks.
<JRP2234> metroid prime
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Metroid UI
<pony64> metriod dime
<pony64> lets see how many words we can find that ryhmes with dime, anyone wanna play
<JRP2234> metroid prime was a fantastic game
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Metroid Rhyme
<pony64> metriod prime
<pony64> XD
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Samus the Rapper
<CrystalPhoenix> anything else you want to say about the system?
<berberborscing> Samus for gameboy: Is that a naked woman or a lot of peach colored pixels
<pony64> nope, chuck testa
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> is a pony with a shirt considered naked?
<berberborscing> Obviously not.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Because the Gameboy has colors.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> is a person with only a shirt considered naked
<berberborscing> No.
<Spell-of-Gaming> -.-
<JRP2234> http://metroid.retropixel.net/metroid2/screenshots/metroid2_28.gif
<pony64> ponies are never "considered naked" cause their customs don't werk liek dat
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's half-naked.

<Spell-of-Gaming> Werewolf Queen, it's always Werewolf Queen.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ponies are good with concepts
<Spell-of-Gaming> How?
<pony64> they are also good with a side of fries
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did you see that article where they basically created Plato's Republic?
<Spell-of-Gaming> what
<berberborscing> Considering next episode is named "Keep Calm and Flutter On", I can guess two things.
<berberborscing> 1. It's about Fluttershy.
<pony64> 1, dont let me eat pears
<pony64> i hate pears
<pony64> ok, sorry go on
<berberborscing> 2. It is based off a meme, and will probably be targeted at that now more popular older audience
<JRP2234> my brothers dog attackted my cat :<
<berberborscing> The meme being "Keep Calm and "anything inserted here)
<CrystalPhoenix> berberborscing, >Meme
<pony64> never actually HERD of that meme

<Spell-of-Gaming> I stopped reading after I realized that the haters will flee to this.
<Pinkies4thWall> Anyway, 'sup?
<Spell-of-Gaming> That is, when I hovered the link.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's a historic fact
<berberborscing> That say stuff like "Keep Calm and Eat Cookies:
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's not a meme.
<Pinkies4thWall> Waitwut
<pony64> this is evil why is this gunna be a mlp title...
<Pinkies4thWall> How did i get a 6 in 10?
<berberborscing> "Keep Calm and Do Homework" (obviously the work of a teavher)
<CrystalPhoenix> well guess what that is referencing
<Spell-of-Gaming> I know the sypnosis for the episode but I'm not allowed to spoil it since it's against the rules.

<aniderp|bestcakeever> but not tommorow
<Spell-of-Gaming> I will, playing Animal Crossing. .3.

<Spell-of-Gaming> Or at least games that have an event for New Year's Eve.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> whihc animal crossing?
<Spell-of-Gaming> City Folk
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how old are you? -shot-
<Spell-of-Gaming> My country is near Japan. So, yeah, I'll find Japanese MMOs. ^w^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hell, even just Nico Nico Douga is fine by me.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i only played animal crossing o.O
<Spell-of-Gaming> This slide show needs more milkshakes
<aniderp|bestcakeever> for the gamecube..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and resetti always got mad
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm also involved in an upcoming fansite for Animal Crossing right now
<Spell-of-Gaming> It'll be done by 2013, I'm pretty sure.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> does resetti apper in the one you play?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Resetti appears in every Animal Crossing game, actually.
<Spell-of-Gaming> If you repeatedly reset, he'll start making you type stuff.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> even his brother?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i been to that part
<aniderp|bestcakeever> he yells also
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #539
<Spell-of-Gaming> As far as I know, yeah.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Typing in City Folk is pretty hard without a USB Keyboard.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Honestly, I would've paid extra for a keyboard.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what is city folk for?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well, it's an upgrade from the previous game, Wild World.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i remember
<Spell-of-Gaming> You can visit the city mainly.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i used to use my gameboy adavance
<aniderp|bestcakeever> for the mini game?
<NocturnalBlade> Well i'm off to bed guys, good night ^_^
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what is sleep?
<NocturnalBlade> aniderp|bestcakeever: something i need :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yeah, it's possible to connect your GBA to your GC to visit the island freely.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes a whale can pop up while riding the boat.
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's hidden
<Spell-of-Gaming> As a shadow, like a fish.

<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
*Gold_Demona is greeted by the chirping of crickets...
*RoboGerbil chirps
<Gold_Demona> lol
<RoboGerbil> you think people are up at 4:45 am bronystate time?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: hai :D
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: People usually are. XD
<Gold_Demona> The Euros and the Aussies usually are anyway
<Gold_Demona> ohai aniderp|bestcakeever =)

<Gold_Demona> Bailey's is really good. =)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then im gonna be a good girl and wait till im 21
<Dis> I'm up and I'm in Texas
<Gold_Demona> Further west than me. I'm in Florida. :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> arent you all proud of me?
<Dis> pfft no
<Dis> I probably won't either :P
<Gold_Demona> Good for you, aniderp|bestcakeever =)
<Gold_Demona> My husband never had such drinks until he was 21. Cuz he's a boring stiff like that. :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but i promised you lot i would wait till 21
<Dis> I tried sneaking a beer once when I was really little and it was nasty as fuck. I'm not tempted to try drinking.
<Gold_Demona> Good on you :>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but it is special occasion so its ok right?
<KrazyNoobs> dem three comments in that short amount of time
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Honestly, it makes no difference to me. As long as you're happy about the decision, that's all that matters
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but like i said.. i gotta be really careful
<aniderp|bestcakeever> since i on meds
<Gold_Demona> Dis: Beer is an acquired taste. Also I had to try many bad ones before finding a beer I liked. =/
<Gold_Demona> Cheap beer is crap
<aniderp|bestcakeever> is bud lite lime good?
<KrazyNoobs> in Australia, you can drink when you're 18
<Gold_Demona> Meh. Not a fan of any Bud
<KrazyNoobs> OF course, I have no plans on drinking at all in my life.
<Gold_Demona> I usually drink Yuenling.
<Gold_Demona> yuengling*
<aniderp|bestcakeever> should i let myself pour tonight or have someone else pour?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: If you're at a party with strangers, always pour your own drink
<aniderp|bestcakeever> wait... i dont think i have red solo cup
<aniderp|bestcakeever> its at home
<Gold_Demona> Then it should be fine as long as the one pouring isn't an asshole.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i will let my brother do it if he home
<aniderp|bestcakeever> he poured last one
<Gold_Demona> Cool
<aniderp|bestcakeever> knowing me i would be shaky and pour too much
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that'd be bad

<aniderp|bestcakeever> im your favorite wolfie right?
<Gold_Demona> My hubby and I area spending the new year at my mom's house.
<Gold_Demona> As soon as he gets off work today we'll head over there
<Alchemist> well Im gonna get beer only if the stores are not closed. They usually are after noon...
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: is that a good thing?
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: just because stereotypically one does not like the in laws and vice versa
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Yeah, New Years at my mom's is always fun. And my uncle's gonna be there, so my hubby will have another man to talk to. :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: wolfie? o.o
<Gold_Demona> We get along with our in-laws just fine. =)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yea o.O
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im a wolfie sometimes o.O
<Gold_Demona> Of course each of us prefers the company of our own parents, but that's to be expected. XD
<Gold_Demona> Normally anyway
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Okies, you're best wolfie :3
<AdamTheDuck> Good evening BronyState
<Gold_Demona> Hi Ducky =D
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: lucky you then :) My brother have issues with his in laws. Or more like the other way around. Last time they talked to our side of the family was more than 2 years ago (since the wedding :D )
<AdamTheDuck> 3 hours till New Years here
<Gold_Demona> 19 hours until new years here. XP
<killerpony7733> About 14 hours left here
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona! :)
<Gold_Demona> Hi MadSurge =D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Guess what I'm watching. >.>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ponies? :P
<Gold_Demona> enwp
<Gold_Demona> newp*
<AdamTheDuck> What are... Ponies? o.o
<MadSurge> I dunno then :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02imma poneh :3
<AdamTheDuck> I have never heard of such a word
<Gold_Demona> A let's play of LLL"Lupin La Morte, Zenigata L'amore"... Yes, I'm a dork. XP
<SpadeKyurem> Ok this is bugging the crap out of me
<Gold_Demona> Where'd all those extre L's come from? O_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yaaaay :D I am bad at stealth games though
<SpadeKyurem> Im playing OOT 3d and Im in the water temple and I seem to be missing a key and I h=the only two chests i havent opened I cant reach without said key and I have 0
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Me too, but I have the one and only English-dub Lupin game anyway. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Gold_Demona> I wish THIS game was the one we got in English dub. The story is MUCH better in this game. And it looks like a lot more fun. :<
<SpadeKyurem> Fucking water temple...the temple its self isnt hard...this key bullshit is pissing me off
<Alchemist> has anyone played with FTL? I dunno if I should buy it...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well I had a pirate copy of a quite well made PS1 game of Fist of the North Star at one point, all in Japanese
<Gold_Demona> If I ever win the lottery, I'd get myself a european playstation just so I can play this game.
<Alchemist> there is a difference between consoles depending on the continent? O_O
<Gold_Demona> Same restrictions as DVDs
<Alchemist> but...why?
<Gold_Demona> You can't play European discs on American systems because of Region codes
<wipergone2> AdamTheDuck: hey
<AdamTheDuck> Hello wipergone2
<Gold_Demona> North America is Region 1. I don't remember what the other regions are numbered
<wipergone2> AdamTheDuck: can i show u somthing
<Alchemist> I know, I think europe is divided into 2 regions
<AdamTheDuck> Playing "Yellow Submarine" on Audiosurf \:3/
<AdamTheDuck> Such a great song :$
<Gold_Demona> They're coded different so they're not compatible with foreign machines
<Gold_Demona> Which is stupid
<RoboGerbil> lolol wtf is this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuA_Z4iAybg
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: and a great movie :D
<Alchemist> I really cant see the reason behind it...
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNF-KIFWyA4&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw My days in a nutshell
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Other than to prevent illegal imports? I dunno.
<SpadeKyurem> Also Ocarina of Time 3d completly makes the water temple easy, it has marking for the water level directions and a camera shot for a easily missed key
<Alchemist> SpadeKyurem: here's mine: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfchvCyHmsc
<Gold_Demona> Ocarina of Time 3d? Wasn't the original ALREADY in 3d? O_o
<SpadeKyurem> Gold_Demona: Updated graphics
<SpadeKyurem> And some stuff was changed
<Gold_Demona> But, it was already 3d...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 3DS version
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<SpadeKyurem> You know whats really funny?
<SpadeKyurem> Master quest water temple is patheticly easy
<SpadeKyurem> And that is supposed to be the hard mode
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: in this age where most movies and games are acquired from the net (and I mean legally), is that really a problem?
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem: that's because they knew they made it too hard in the original game :D
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: There are region restrictions on the internet as well.
<SpadeKyurem> MadSurge: Its not that hard
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem: also, cows on the walls
<SpadeKyurem> People overreact
<SpadeKyurem> MadSurge: God that is so weird
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Which is why most folks outside the US can't legally acquire English-speaking ponies
<SpadeKyurem> Biggoron sword is best weapon
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: well, that just shows how much money I spend on this stuff. I had no idea :D
<MadSurge> You do require an absurd amount of stuff to get it though SpadeKyurem
<SpadeKyurem> MadSurge: not really
<SpadeKyurem> I did it right before I did any of the temples
<SpadeKyurem> And my god Dark Link is pathetic with it
<MadSurge> I don't really like timed missions :D
<SpadeKyurem> Also from what I heard theres a cut temple in OOT
<SpadeKyurem> The whole area you go when you free a sage was supposed to be a hub of some sorts
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: There are places that sell "region-free" players that can play any dvd no matter where it's from.
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: I just wish that was the case with Playstation 2's =/
<Gold_Demona> But alas there's no such thing as a region-free PS2
<SpadeKyurem> Also never ever bother getting all the golden skultulas in the game, the reward is pointless
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Oh well, emulators I guess :D
<Sumica> 00,10well there is Gold_Demona, but only developers have them
<Gold_Demona> ¬_¬
<MadSurge> Hello Sumica! :)
<Sumica> 00,10used them alot at actvision
<Sumica> 00,10they have dark blue cases.
<Gold_Demona> That doesn't really count, sumi. Normal people can't buy them. :P
<Sumica> 00,10you are right, I am not normal
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Ponies47> I can't fall asleep ;_;
<Gold_Demona> Try counting sheep?
<SpadeKyurem> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/353/ my face when I find out I missed a passage at one end of the dungeon when I wasted my time going to the other end trying to find a key
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona, Stuff like that doesn't work for me
<aniderp|bestcakeever> nevermind not gonna do was i was gonna do
<DaringDerpy> hey
<Gold_Demona> Ponies47: Warm milk and honey.
<sub06905> Ponies47, because this?: http://i.imgur.com/hW57z.jpg
<Gold_Demona> sub06905: lol XD
<SpadeKyurem> One thing I like about OOT 3d is when you pull out the Ocarina you can pull up a song sheet while you have it up so easy song list
<Ponies47> sub06905, Ponies @_@
<sub06905> :3
<Sumica> 00,10so want more of me softly rageing at ftl?
<sub06905> sure
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, hehe ok :$
<Gold_Demona> lol soft raging
<SpadeKyurem> Is there a term for someone who collects shit in a game even though you dont really need to?
<MadSurge> Sumica: yes please! :)
<Gold_Demona> SpadeKyurem: Completionist?

<XAX> >here is my fully automatic supressed knife
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona, Yeah that doesn't work either
<SpadeKyurem> Even though I know the reward for getting every gold skultula is pointless I feel compelled to get everyone I come across

<AdamTheDuck> XAX, hehe :$
*Ponies47 looks around for something to hit himself in the head with
<SpadeKyurem> Guess what the pointless reward is
<DaringDerpy> 4chan just taught me about flutterrape. I'm confused.
<SpadeKyurem> infinite money
<Gold_Demona> Yay, infinite money!
<SpadeKyurem> But you get it at the point of the game when its usless
<Ryunosuke> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<AdamTheDuck> Money? o.o

<AdamTheDuck> lodsamonee~
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ipod been running like a long time
<SpadeKyurem> I wish I had an idea of what the hell Im watching
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but it took breaks
<MadSurge> Pew pew
<aniderp|bestcakeever> should i give my ipod a reset?
<SpadeKyurem> Also Im on brony state at almost 5:00 AM what am I doing with my life?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> been on since 2 am
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem: go to bed!
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck I remember just loving being a demo in killing floor. I literally just loved having two nade launchers to blow tons of enemies away with and pipe bombs yes pipe bombs :D
<MasterSonic10> Hello Bronies!!!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> -pokes madsurge-
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, I live having my friends depend on the only medic because apparently no one wants to play medic but me >.>
<AdamTheDuck> love*
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Awww
<killerpony7733> Medic is fun when your team is good.
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, then if they were a dick to me I'd just deprive them of heals XD
<AdamTheDuck> Oh good times
<killerpony7733> Medic gun is a bit wonky though at times.
<SpadeKyurem> Seriously what the heck am I watching?
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeKyurem, we're watching Sumi play FTL
<DaringDerpy> FTL
<SpadeKyurem> FTL?
<AdamTheDuck> and watching him flip tables when he dies
<AdamTheDuck> Faster Than Light
<DaringDerpy> faster than light
<DaringDerpy> was an indie hit last summer
<SpadeKyurem> Well Morpha got utterly wrecked, he didnt even get an attack off on me
<SpadeKyurem> Rabble Rabble
<DaringDerpy> best laser in the game
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/05b46c474d1710ac3a9cdaa25d572482.png WORTH IT :D
<DaringDerpy> I don't get it. Is this a reference to some obscure TV show?
<SpadeKyurem> They could have been killed! MadSurge
<Kandarihu> Dangit, I hate it when the doors go down
<MadSurge> She took them right into the... DANGER ZONE
<Ryunosuke> FTL = For the lose
<Ryunosuke> :p
<SpadeKyurem> Also is it me or do I see Wildfire in that comic MadSurge ?
<DaringDerpy> this is bad
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem: that pink OC was supposed to be Wildfire, so in the comic she switches between the two :D
<KrazyNoobs> im back
<KrazyNoobs> sorry
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a8d8497594ee4e9f3930a8d968284dfe.png :3 awwwww
<SpadeKyurem> MadSurge: I think this is cuter http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/364/2/b/scientist_ponies__by_drpancakees-d5ppr6q.png
<MadSurge> They're not having a nice quiet Heart's Warming ;_;
<Alma> Can somebody throw me a link where I can watch Clannad, Darker Than Black and Cowboy Bebop in japanese w/ or w/o english subtitles?
<Kandarihu> The first game I played, some joker set fire to the door-room in Sector 1, and I friggin' carried it for two sectors before dying.
<DaringDerpy> the episode from last saturday was originally written for derpy, not for spike
<Lil_B> hello Bronystates
<Gold_Demona> hi Lil_B
<DaringDerpy> but then hasbro euthanized her
<DaringDerpy> hi Lil_B
<Lil_B> thanks Gold_Demona and DaringDerpy
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: o rly?
<Gold_Demona> Euthanized... seriously?
<DaringDerpy> because she was handicapped
<DaringDerpy> never allowed on screen again
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy would make sense, but stil, this Episode was Painful to watch :/
<DaringDerpy> yes...
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: I think that Hasbro tries to avoid anything we like.
<Gold_Demona> But seriosuly... Euthanized? Isn't that a little dramatic?
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: That would explain why they needed something to replace the episode with, and why they gave us crap for this episode.
<SpadeKyurem> I still fail to see how Derpy was offensive
<XAX> right
<DaringDerpy> Gold_Demona: drama? you have no heart for ponies
<DaringDerpy> :P
<XAX> We're finally past 9>2012
<XAX> well, here at least
<DaringDerpy> not here
<XAX> been 2013 for 5 mins or so
<Gold_Demona> I just think it's silly to put such dramatic terminology on a cartoon character.
<TheAussieBrony> Still 10:04 here
<KrazyNoobs> XAX: LOL
<sub06905> still 2012 here :I
<KrazyNoobs> XAX: Celebrate the new year by using colors.
<KrazyNoobs> :)
<DaringDerpy> how does it feel XAX?
<DaringDerpy> Gold_Demona: we are talking about derpy here
<Gold_Demona> It's 6am New Years Eve here. Still have the rest of the day before it's 2013 here. :P
<XAX> DaringDerpy: average
<sub06905> XAX lives in the future :3
<Lil_B> Whom will Celebrate New Year on Bronystate?
<Gold_Demona> DaringDerpy: I know! But she's a cartoon character! She's not dead!
<DaringDerpy> I think I will, Lil_B
<Kandarihu> I probably will.
<KrazyNoobs> And yeah, Hasbro is preventing the show from being what it could be.
<Gold_Demona> She was never alive to begin with!
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy nice, sso I'm nbot alone :)
<XAX> sub06905: My country is the furthest ahead in timezones.
<DaringDerpy> Gold_Demona: stop confusing me with your facts!
<DaringDerpy> Lil_B: not sure if I will get drunk or not
<SpadeKyurem> So am I missing anything if I skip, Spike at your service?
<KrazyNoobs> NO
<KrazyNoobs> NOT MISSING A THING
<sub06905> ^
<SpadeKyurem> So it was crap then
<Gold_Demona> I liked the episode, personally. =/
<Lil_B> XAX my Timezone will exceed yours oin every aspect, just you wait!
<DaringDerpy> SpadeKyurem: it has a nice twilight ocd moment
<SpadeKyurem> Season 3 was going so great and then one episode tottaly bombs
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/f9FOc.png
<p4ngya> best part of the whole episode
<KrazyNoobs> The episode was the worst of the series, I like Spike, and I think that he was a good character, but this episode completely killed every good characteristic about him. He was portrayed as a tool in this episode, and allowed all the characters to look down to him. I miss season 1, where he cared what other ponies thought of him.
<SpadeKyurem> DaringDerpy: Wut
<Lil_B> I'll take a look on the S3 Episode list, butr so far, it reaslly didn't impress me :P
<KrazyNoobs> RIP Spike
<SpadeKyurem> KrazyNoobs: Spike is pretty much a tool to rarity to begin with
<KrazyNoobs> Unless they make a spike episode sometime in the future that is really good.
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, happy new year XAX :P
<KrazyNoobs> Not sure whether to celebrate with 09,00 or 04,12... (jks)
<DaringDerpy> oh, right, happy new year! :)
<SpadeKyurem> So was a good episode replaced with said episode or what?
<Lil_B> Episode 11 will be about Spike again
<Lil_B> ... damnit
<DaringDerpy> no one likes spike
<Lil_B> according to the title i mean
<Gold_Demona> I like SPike :<
<DaringDerpy> we need more twilight sparkle episodes
<sub06905> im just going to leave this here: http://i.imgur.com/w1MNh.jpg
<DaringDerpy> like in season 1
<Java> Still 6 hours before I reach new year. But I don't really care about new year....
<SpadeKyurem> Spike really has nothing to do these days
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, Season 3 was only good with episode 3, 5, 6 and 7. (only my opinion, everypony has different opinions). Season 1 is my fav.
<SpadeKyurem> He's just a fax machine esentally
<Kandarihu> Sumica, it's generally good to make sure that the engines, shields, weapons, and helm are manned. You'll shoot faster, recharge shields faster, and dodge more.
<Java> The problem with this game is that the ship is just too damn small.
<DaringDerpy> I agree, KrazyNoobs. They were the good ones
<Lil_B> My Favs of S3 have been... mmmm... the wonderbolt erpisode (even if it was kinda shallow) and maybe one bad seed
<SpadeKyurem> So did At your service replace an episode or what?
<Java> Even Voyager have at least over 100 crew members.
<DaringDerpy> SpadeKyurem: rumours say they replaced a character, everything else was roughly the same
<KrazyNoobs> Season 3, overall, lacks the amazing character each of the Mane 6 displayed in Season 1.
<Lil_B> sub06905 now I wanna see a Pinkie Pie with a Nicolas Cage Face
<Java> Even Andromeda have robots!
<sub06905> Lil_B, :D
<KrazyNoobs> 3 hours until new year here in Australia.
<KrazyNoobs> :)
<Ryunosuke> 18 here
<DaringDerpy> use the lvl3 laser
<Java> I think overall Season 3 work well.
<DaringDerpy> the beam can't break the shield
<Java> Also Wonderbolt Academy actually help RD character grew up.
<SpadeKyurem> Lightning Dust seems like a realt= bitch though
<KrazyNoobs> Season 3's only good character is Pinkie, in my opinion. I like how they made her more random.
<SpadeKyurem> *real
<SpadeKyurem> KrazyNoobs: Like she isnt already
<Lil_B> She was supposed to be, but the way she just got escorded away without a word at the end was rather anticlimatic
<Java> SpadeKyurem: She is. People try to connect her with Trixie. The problem is Trixie is just a boasting mare while LD willing to let other ponies die for her own gain.
<Lil_B> Lightning DFust I mean
<ThunderBreeze> There's one character i would like to see in Baby form. Fluttershy! =) i'm sure everyone would die ^^
<SpadeKyurem> I hope Lightning Dust got kicked out of the acedemy for that shit
<AK_Scinder> Hmm, i enjoyed all but the latest ep, the story just seemed too forced and not quite believeable.
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, Hasbro isn't letting MLP:FiM go to its potential.
<DaringDerpy> ThunderBreeze: too far
<KrazyNoobs> Except for Canterlot Wedding
<KrazyNoobs> A Canterlot Wedding showed how good the show could be.
<ThunderBreeze> But that was already huge with Baby Applejack don't you agree?
<KrazyNoobs> Although the plot was a little rushed.
<SpadeKyurem> Although the logic even for a cartoon went out the window for that episode
<SpadeKyurem> Alot
<Lil_B> HASHTAGyolo
<sub06905> lol
<KrazyNoobs> Lil_B: Nice way to avoid getting in trouble for advertising other channels. XD
<Java> Also Wonderboly Academy shows that Dash willing to lose her biggest dream if that dream endanger the life of her friends and her principal. That's Loyalty to ya
<Lil_B> KrazyNoobs :P
<DaringDerpy> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/314/0/4/filly_fluttershy_with_juicebox_by_esipode-d4fo1ru.png
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: Diabeetus achieved
<Ponies47> Ohai oni_link :3
*Java pat filly Fluttershy's head.
<SpadeKyurem> When I watch that episode, if Lightning Dust doesnt get kicked out of the academy I will flip my shit
<Lil_B> I wanna see another Rarity Episode and see the writers try their hardest to not make it about generosity :P
<oni_link> hiyo Ponies47 :3
<sub06905> i see you still cant sleep Ponies47 :3
<Lil_B> hello oni_link and Ponies47 :)
<Java> SpadeKyurem: Maybe she will be kicked out. Or court martialed. Or join Celestia's black ops :/
<SpadeKyurem> Lil_B: Cant be that hard given how un generous Rarity can be
<DaringDerpy> http://www.mlponline.net/attachments/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-baby-mane-six-gif.2598/
<Lil_B> SpadeKyurem awww, she is only generous when she needs to be :P
<Kandarihu> My only gripe with Wonderbolt Academy is that it seems to be retconning the previous episode about RD becoming Scootaloo's stepsister. Later episodes have RD in the cast as if Wonderbolt Academy never happened, or ended differently.
<SpadeKyurem> I mean if somepony almost kills ponies to succeed you dont deserve to be a wonderbolt
<Ponies47> oni_link, I can't sleep agian! XD
<Ponies47> sub06905, Newp :3
<Ponies47> Hey Lil_B :3
<oni_link> Ponies47: Its okay, neither can I XD
<alexxm> hey guys
<oni_link> and hi Lil_B I finally caught you XD
<SpadeKyurem> Although I have to fault Twilight and friends to being on clouds in the fucking first place
<Lil_B> oni_link I suggest to ujse a Masterball
<DaringDerpy> so I am sitting here, posting pictures of cartoon baby ponies. wtf happened to me?
<DaringDerpy> something is wrong
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, ponies happened. Ponies.
<Ponies47> oni_link, It's 5:20 AM and I'm not the least bit sleepy. Opreation all nighter is a go :P
<oni_link> Lil_B: But I used it on Zapdos :(
<Java> SpadeKyurem: I think Rarity going a little bit un-generous I don't think that's the truth. I mean she just asking for shallow stuff. And "over-generous" are worse.
<Java> death?
<oni_link> Ponies47: woo hooo :3
<Java> Escape?
<Java> There goes the crew
<SpadeKyurem> Even if what Lightning Dust was uncalled for, being unprotected on clouds is asking for disaster
<DaringDerpy> boooo
<SpadeKyurem> *did
<SpadeKyurem> '
*Ponies47 chugs another can of soda ' Whooooo! PARTY!"
<Lil_B> oni_link that's why you keep it until you can use the Item Multiplier-Glitch
<Java> The captain is like "We will fight everyone!"
*AdamTheDuck licks oni_link
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<SpadeKyurem> So im chalking it up to half Lightning being a total selfish bitch and half Twilight and friends being complete morons
<oni_link> Lil_B: missingno o,o he turned into a lapras
<oni_link> hi AdamTheDuck :3
*Lil_B hugs AdamTheDuck
<Java> SpadeKyurem: What? at least they are coming prepared with cloud walking spell.
*AdamTheDuck noms on Lil_B's ear :3
<Lil_B> mah Eeeerrr
<Java> Also visiting a friend isn't what we consider "moronic"
<SpadeKyurem> Java: That still doesnt acount for any danger of being KNOCKED OFF
<SpadeKyurem> No one ever thought of that
<Java> SpadeKyurem: The tornado is too sudden.
<DaringDerpy> good start, Sumica
<SpadeKyurem> Its called being prepared
<Java> No one can expect to avoid a sudden tornado
<SpadeKyurem> Also couldent fluttershy fucking fly?
<Lil_B> I'm considering getting sdomething to eat :/
<Kandarihu> I swear! Sumica's having MUCH worse luck than I get.
<Java> SpadeKyurem: No. Let say that there's an earthquake somewhere. Did the victim get the blame? no.
<oni_link> Lil_B: will you come back after?
<DaringDerpy> worst start I've ever seen
<DaringDerpy> awesome
<Lil_B> oni_link I usually plan too (I have no other place to stay :( )
<Lil_B> oni_link something important?
<oni_link> Lil_B: youre always welcome here, and I was just curious :P
<SpadeKyurem> Java: You're missing the point, Twilight should have been prepared for any kind of danger, even if it was sudden, theres always a possibility for something to go horribly wrong
<Lil_B> Why I'm I so much in a Synthazither mood since a few month >.<
<Java> SpadeKyurem: You can't predict everything. Did you carry 4 spare tires in case ALL your tires blow out?
<Java> Of course not
<Java> Did your car carry all kind of car spare parts just in case? of course not
<oni_link> Lil_B: synth is nice :P
<SpadeKyurem> EVEN SO, they should have made sure they would land safely in ANY SCENARIO
<Java> Did you go out with a complete set of first aid kit all day everyday? of course not.
<alexxm> SpadeKyurem but timber wolves don't usaully venture out of the everfree let along close to the edges of it apart from when the zap apples are going to grow and since twilight didn't know any of hte signs had happened how could she know
<SpadeKyurem> Java: Missing the fucking point man....
<Lil_B> oni_link I mean really retro sounding ones :) (I'll give you a link :) )
<Java> SpadeKyurem: No, you're missing the point completteli
<Java> completely
<DaringDerpy> http://cdn.derpiboo.ru/media/BAhbBlsHOgZmSSJPMjAxMi8xMi8yOS8xMl80N180N182NjJfMTk2NTU3X19VTk9QVF9fc2FmZV90d2lsaWdodF9zcGFya2xlX3Nwb2lsZXJzMDNlMDkGOgZFVA/196557__safe_twilight-sparkle_applejack_spike_nightmare-moon_changeling_dragon_spike-at-your-service_spoiler-s03e09_a-canterlot-wedding_friendship-is-magic_dragonshy_it-quo-s-about-time_ti.jpg
<DaringDerpy> oh, sry
<DaringDerpy> a bit long
<sub06905> dat link
<oni_link> Lil_B: yay
<SpadeKyurem> Right because me pointing out being on a cloud suspended high in the air with no form of protection is missing the point
<Java> You can't expect a passenger plane to intercept a missile from jet fighters.
<SpadeKyurem> Right....
<Java> right
<SpadeKyurem> Java: So you're going to miss the fucking point they were on a cloud high in the air with no protection whats so ever
<SpadeKyurem> Thats MY POINT
<p4ngya> lol spade are you being serious right now
<p4ngya> or are you trolling
<Jmo> Wowza, getting serious over this?
<Kandarihu> Java, I don't know. You probably could if the plane is flying into an active combat zone.
<Jmo> You must be really bored.
<Java> Kandarihu: The problem is the academy is a friendly zone
<MadSurge> Yeah, because magical reassembling wolves are not scary
<DaringDerpy> FiW http://i.imgur.com/fgG57.jpg
<Java> No once can expect a sudden tornado. Especially in a realm where you can control your weather.
<SpadeKyurem> Again..being that high up in the air with no form of protection is suicide
<Kandarihu> Java, yes, but it's a place where that sort of things should be expected.
<alexxm> maybe at a weather school but not a flying school
<Java> Kandarihu: Even it's not likely that the event could happened suddenly.
<Java> It's like asking all car owners to install roll bars in case of the car rolling out of control.
<SpadeKyurem> Oh for the love of god
<Kandarihu> Given the stakes of the competition, a sudden tornado CAN be expected to happen if any candidate's raw talent exceeds her/his discipline, as was the case with Lightning Dust.
<SpadeKyurem> So you dont think having ANY FORM OF PROTECTION on a fucking cloud on that hight is not needed
<p4ngya> but twilight had no idea what the competition was like
<Java> SpadeKyurem: They don't expect someone to create a sudden tornado. Not even Spitfire.
<SpadeKyurem> Java: Its called being prepared
<Java> Also RD admit it was very reckless and dangerous.
<Java> It's OVER prepared for something we don't know yet.
<SpadeKyurem> Right...because not expecting sompony to pull shit is over prepared
<alexxm> maybe tornado protection would be a good idea at a weather school but not a flight school
<alexxm> i mean it;s not something that you would really expect to happen
<Java> It's like what happened during Aceh's Tsunami. We lost the most and we start blaming each other. But in the end we know it's a sudden occurence and we can't possibly ready to evacuate the people.
<Java> It's like saying that we must WALLED EVERY BEACH in Aceh.
<Java> Japan got hit with Tsunami a lot
<Java> We don't
<Java> So when we got hit we lost a lot.
<KrazyNoobs> I love that new Youtube glitch with the unstoppable music.
<SpadeKyurem> Java: I fail to get how you dont think being unprotected on a really high up on a cloud is not stupid in the slightest
<Java> The same as living on a beach without building a tsunami wall.
<p4ngya> its a freakin cloud, man
<p4ngya> a cloud
<SpadeKyurem> So you dont think ponies who CANT FLY SHOULD HAVE NO PROTECTION, ok I get it then
<Java> Sigh. You sounds like a broken record. I just woke up and already arguing on the internet. If you can't read my reasonings so be it.
<Kandarihu> Now there are practical ways of preparing for a disaster and impractical ways. A Tsunami wall is entirely impractical. The governments in most tsunami-prone areas have early warning systems to call for an evacuation when they see a tsunami coming. That's reasonable.
<Java> Go ahead and wall every beach. Go ahead and put a huge net on every sides of the academy. Go ahead and put animal traps all around forests.
<SpadeKyurem> Java: You arent gettingn what Im trying to say...the fact is..they had no protecting from any possiblity for ponies who cant fucking fly
<p4ngya> this is hilarious
<Jmo> It isn't hilarious, it's embarassing.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I drew R34 https://www.dropbox.com/s/p21t1eunbkq21uh/Sketch31133740.png
<Java> Kandarihu: Dude, we never got hit by Tsunami. Japan got hit a lot because they are literally on the "dragon's back" Sure we're on the fault line too but most of our quakes are on land.
<Simon> Pff, I can draw better
<aniderp|bestcakeever> SuperBrony64: i was gonna make a moo pony
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but... the utter didnt look right so i didnt
<Ponies47> Naughty SB ;3
<Java> Kandarihu: Also the fact that the source of the tsunami is too close to the beach. So even when the alarm goes off. We can't completely evacuate everyone
<KrazyNoobs> Not sure if should click link...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im gonna click link..
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: Oh you :D silly moo
*KrazyNoobs reluctantly clicks link

<aniderp|bestcakeever> but i can try something..
<PoniesFortress47> Because TF2 at almost 6:00 AM is the best time to play :P
<KrazyNoobs> SuperBrony64: MY SIDES
<KrazyNoobs> SuperBrony64: Didn't know why I clicked the link..
<Java> Kandarihu: But even Japan with its early warning system lost a lot in the recent tsunami. In the end it's all about nature.
<Java> We can't be completely prepared.
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: I was expecting a sketch of a Nissan Skyline ;3;
<SuperBrony64> 11,02nature can go %$€# off
<oni_link> those cars are nice
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is there someone who is streaming right now?
<Java> SuperBrony64: Nature is cruel but also beautiful
<SpadeKyurem> Java: But you dont seem to agree that we should have some form of protection WHICH IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO IMPLY
<Kandarihu> Java, I see your point.
<Java> SpadeKyurem: Sigh.... "We can't always be prepared for something unexpected." that's all.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Because no one is answering me, I guess the answer is "no".
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Outside sucks and is dangerous. Germs, bears, meteors, you can never tell. Inside has AC and Internet. You make the choice.
<Kandarihu> Spell-of-Gaming, Sumica is streaming FTL
<SpadeKyurem> Outside is worst game
<Java> Spell-of-Gaming: Well, it's streaming
<Java> Maybe you need to refresh the video?
<JRP2234> meow
<sub06905> outside has best graphics though o3o
<Spell-of-Gaming> Not really wanting to watch the stream, just trying to ask
<SpadeKyurem> Outside's gameplay sucks

<Kandarihu> I kind of agree with sub06905 that outside has the best graphics. And also, I'm not exactly avoiding germs by not going outside.
*Ponies47 snuggles SuperBrony64 \:3/
<XAX> Jmo: Two thirds of your talking time is spent ripping someone else out.
<Jmo> I know right?
<sub06905> real life needs cheat codes

<Spell-of-Gaming> It's nearing New Year's Eve on my Animal Crossing town ^w^
<SpadeKyurem> Isnt fire on a space ship a really bad thing?
<SpadeKyurem> Would a sprinkler even help?

<Java> WIN!
<Spell-of-Gaming> No, wait, it's 15 minutes
<Spell-of-Gaming> Still too long
<Java> Fix all the damages!
<DaringDerpy> all your money
<AdamTheDuck> All the scrap metal
<SpadeKyurem> Sumica: So how badly can this game fuck you over?
<SpadeKyurem> Wow
<SpadeKyurem> This game is more a dick than Battle toads or I wanna be the guy
<KrazyNoobs> Well, 2012 was a great year, who agrees?
<Spell-of-Gaming> My SD card doesn't work on City Folk o3o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02VioletGreySha: o3o
<DaringDerpy> 2012 was good, yes
<KrazyNoobs> For bronies, that is
<Spell-of-Gaming> So I can't save pictures, I can only send them to the Wii Message Board .-.
<VioletGreySha> SuperBrony64; silly :§
<Java> I can imagine the recruitment poster for this fleet: "Join the Starfleet and DIE!"
<VioletGreySha> :3
<Ponies47> http://i.imgur.com/l45WT.jpg
<Kandarihu> SpadeKyurem, like I said earlier, my first attempt at this game was largely spent with a huge fire emanating from my door room.
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha, O3O
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think 2012 was good for bronies
<DaringDerpy> don't have a good feeling for 2013 though
<VioletGreySha> Ponies47; =3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> 2012....
<Spell-of-Gaming> We didn't have a lot of episodes
<aniderp|bestcakeever> was hurt myself ;_;
<SpadeKyurem> Im starting to wonder if this game could give I wanna be the guy a run for its money in sheer dickery
<aniderp|bestcakeever> thinking about bad things to myself
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: 2014 is when I guess it will all end for the bronies... I hope I'm wrong.
<Java> SpadeKyurem: You don't play Kaizou Mario World? that game is sadistic.
<DaringDerpy> we will get the first fanmade episode soon
<SpadeKyurem> Java: Forgot that one
<DaringDerpy> hope it becomes a habit
<KrazyNoobs> Did somepony say Kaizu Mario World? O_O
<KrazyNoobs> LOL
<Java> KrazyNoobs: Yes. Be afraid of that game.
<KrazyNoobs> Save state over and over again, lol
<SpadeKyurem> Save state is your friend
<Java> KrazyNoobs: SNES9X....
<DaringDerpy> rocks are immune to fire ^^
<KrazyNoobs> Java: I use ZSNES
<KrazyNoobs> My dad smashed my SNES with a hammer a few months ago...
<SpadeKyurem> KrazyNoobs: Dare I ask why?
<DaringDerpy> btw, space pauses the game
<Java> KrazyNoobs: I'm talking about someone who trolled his friend who play Kaizou Mario World with save state.
<KrazyNoobs> My cousin had that for like 5 years before he gave it to me. I've had it for like 15 years.
<Java> The challenge is NOT to use save states too often.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> maybe 2013 will be better for me..
<DaringDerpy> no cloak for you
<aniderp|bestcakeever> who thinks it will?
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 is asleep guys....LETS BOTHER HIM
<DaringDerpy> you're poor
<KrazyNoobs> My dad was mad at me, SpadeKyurem, and he did that as a punishment. A lot of memories in that thing.
*JRP2234 slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> How about no?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> jaymoo?
<AdamTheDuck> No to what Jmo?o.o
<SpadeKyurem> KrazyNoobs: Ok why the fuck didnt he just TAKE IT AWAY, WHY SMASH IT
<Jmo> aniderp, I'm not gonna play 20Q with your life.
<SpadeKyurem> That is really uncalled for
<Jmo> The no was to bothering SB.
<Kandarihu> Save states are a function of most console emulators, that basically dumps the entire contents of the ingame RAM to a file to quickly return to an earlier point in the game.
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: He could have sold it for a lot.
<Java> How do I PM people?
<Spell-of-Gaming> While I can understand a mental punishment, why even bother smashing something that is pretty valuable?
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: But yeah, when I was around 4, I started playing some games.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wondered if you wanted a cookie o.O
<Jmo> Sell a SNES for alot, rofl.
<Kandarihu> Java, /msg <target> <message>
<KrazyNoobs> Java: See that list of people to the side? Double click on one. Or you can type /query <Nickname>
<alexxm> Java you see the list of names double click the name of the person you want to pm
<Java> thanks. I will send you a video link KrazyNoobs :)
<KrazyNoobs> Java: I've played it before.
<SpadeKyurem> KrazyNoobs: Your dad's a dick
<KrazyNoobs> Java: It was made with that Super Mario World Modder, I think it was LunarMagic.
<Kandarihu> Well, savestates don't work like FTL saves. A real savestate will stay there until it's overridden.
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: Well, one can not judge another just by one bad action. Overall, he was good.
<sub06905> bl2 tiem
<SpadeKyurem> Well smashing a console just to punish someone is not called for
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh Borderlands 2?
<SpadeKyurem> Take the damn thing away not wreck it
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: It was an overreaction in my opinion.
<SpadeKyurem> Oh hai luna
<SpadeKyurem> Awake at 6 AM here...what is wrong with me
<Spell-of-Gaming> Awake at 6 AM?
<Spell-of-Gaming> That won't do.
<Spell-of-Gaming> My school needs me before 7
<Spell-of-Gaming> AM

<September> >Mouse 4
<September> Lol what
<SpadeKyurem> Never understood what Mouse 4 even meant'
<September> I know Mouse 1-3
<September> But I dont use those mice that are like
<September> 8 different buttons
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/jHh8V.png
<DaringDerpy> I have no idea, SpadeKyurem
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mouse 4 lyfe
<September> lool
<SpadeKyurem> Why would a mouse have 8 buttons?
<SpadeKyurem> You only neeed 3...
<P0N3> What game?
<Jmo> For MMORPG purposes.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<SpadeKyurem> I play wow with a three button mouse and I dont have a issue
<P0N3> What game is being streamed right now?
<SpadeKyurem> So I dont see the point
<Jmo> That's your perspective.
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeKyurem, who said it's an issue?
<Jmo> To others it is easier.
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeKyurem, the extra buttons are for people who want further customistion >.>
<SpadeKyurem> Well 8 buttons seems like overkill
<Invoker> Is this Borderlands 2? :I
<AdamTheDuck> Invoker, indeed it is
<September> Yep
<September> BUTT STALLION
<September> HERE GIRL
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai MLP_Brovakiin

<Java> Canadian Kittens?
<KrazyNoobs> CCharmanderK: I don't see a hoodie.

<CCharmanderK> BlackHat: You don't. >_>
<SpadeKyurem> The hell is a proxy and why do you have 7 of them?
<Jmo> Google is your friend and he really doesn't.
<CCharmanderK> Jmo: This guy's got the right idea.
<KrazyNoobs> its a meme... and its not good anymore
<Spell-of-Gaming> 7 proxies? Wut?
<CCharmanderK> Hello, Spell-o-Gaming
<Java> See CCharmanderK, you make us looks old!
<CCharmanderK> :3
<CCharmanderK> I spend a lot of time on KnowYourMeme and YouTube.
<CCharmanderK> A LOT of time.
<Java> CCharmanderK: Spend more time in SCP and TVTropes
<CCharmanderK> Java: I'm on TVTropes a lot too.
<CCharmanderK> I edit mostly anime pages, though.
<Java> Welcome to the best timewaster of the internet
<CCharmanderK> Bitch, please, I've been on there since 2008.
<CCharmanderK> Maybe earlier
<Java> You're old.
<CCharmanderK> I'm 18
<Lil_B> and I'm back :/ I ate well for 1 €
<KrazyNoobs> There is no best waste of time on the internet.
<Java> In internet time you're a grandpa
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Lil_B :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Inb4 Nintendo's Pokemon announcement on January 8 is only the Pokemon Ranch update
<KrazyNoobs> Most of the things on the internet is a waste of time
<CCharmanderK> Java: Srsly? :/
<SpadeKyurem> Except ponies
<Java> CCharmanderK: It's a joke. But hey, in this internet era something got old just in a day.
<KrazyNoobs> g--
<CCharmanderK> Spell-of-Gaming: Don't really care much for Pokemon anymore. My member name has only stuck because it's from my childhood.
<Lil_B> thanbks MLP_Brovakiin :)
<SpadeKyurem> Java: IE the G word
<Java> G? Google?
<KrazyNoobs> What is, Google? google google google
<SpadeKyurem> The forbidden word
<KrazyNoobs> its google google google
<CCharmanderK> Is that anything like gak gak ga- *banned*
<Java> No one remember the era of Altavista
<KrazyNoobs> *kicked
<SpadeKyurem> Java: the age of what?
<CCharmanderK> Damn it, I really need to stop that and OMFG ALTAVISTA.
<KrazyNoobs> CCharmanderK: Talk of gak, that's a paddlin' (whoops)
<CCharmanderK> Those were the days
<Java> SpadeKyurem: LOL yep. The day where it took 5-10 minutes to download a pic.
<KrazyNoobs> During new episodes, some people try to get dubs with their g-- kicks.
<KrazyNoobs> That was last time
<KrazyNoobs> Before the new episode
<Spell-of-Gaming> My download speed is slow as hell /thirdworldproblems
<Java> Spell-of-Gaming: heheheh
<CCharmanderK> Spell-of-Gaming: I learned how to wait by using dial-up as a kid.
<SpadeKyurem> Got a new desktop. connection is crap...why
<Java> But you still in this streaming site, it means it's not that bad.
<pony_6548> you mean *ak kicks?
<CCharmanderK> I'm able to download a 4GB game in about an hour.
<Java> I spent 24 hours downloading a 20 GB game.
<CCharmanderK> The 4GB game in question is the Clannad visual novel.
<SpadeKyurem> I downloaded wow in about 4 hours I think
<SpadeKyurem> And WoW is like 22 GB
<pony_6548> meh
<CCharmanderK> Wurld urf WurlCrooft
<pony_6548> WoW is now game about pandas for kids
<pony_6548> with cartoon sounds
<SpadeKyurem> THAT EXISTET IN LORE FOR AWHILE
<CCharmanderK> Bitch, you best not be dissing pandas.
<Java> I think WOW is popular because it can run on old PCs.
<Java> Not everyone build high end PCs.
<SpadeKyurem> I get freaking pissed when people ignore the fact the Pandaren were in WoW lore for a long freaking time
<pony_6548> "just you know why...."
<CCharmanderK> Only MMO I play is Fantasy Online, which is a simplistic Flash-based MMO.
<CCharmanderK> And even then I only play it for an hour at a time, at most.
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Java> Next year I'm going to try the completely revamped FF14. I saw the video and it's so damn good. I hope they fix most of the problems.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Jmo> Welp.
<Jmo> That answers that.
<CCharmanderK> I spend longer playing Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition. Play sessions on that can last three to four hours if I'm on a roll.
*CCharmanderK LOVES old shooters.
<SpadeKyurem> Play WoW all day ery day
<KrazyNoobs3> Where did KrazyNoobs2 go?
<SpadeKyurem> ded maybe?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Does anyone else love it when characters mistake your gender?
<KrazyNoobs> No, SHockwave crashed on the BronyState page for KrazyNoobs2.
<Java> KrazyNoobs: Did you find that pond?
<Spell-of-Gaming> And their reaction is priceless.
<KrazyNoobs> Java: dun
<KrazyNoobs> *fun
<Java> oh no
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, he's connecting right now.
<KrazyNoobs> KrazyNoobs2, he just connected.
<KrazyNoobs> KrazyNoobs3, she is still on.
<KrazyNoobs> And yes, I like to give them different identities.
<pony_6548> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<XAX> lol
<CCharmanderK> OMG PONY
<KrazyNoobs> pony_6548: HAHAHAHAHA
<Spell-of-Gaming> not that face again]
<pony_6548> meh
<KrazyNoobs> ( ͡° the eyes are not recognized °) i think.
<KrazyNoobs> Only the nose and mouth can be detected
<SpadeKyurem> Welp
<XAX> Is that another script? ( ° ͜ʖ °)
<XAX> sure is.
<Java> Man handsome Jack is cruel
<SpadeKyurem> Sound?
<KrazyNoobs> No, you can do it without the nose and mouth.'
<pony_6548> . ͜ . kag
<KrazyNoobs> ʖ the nose
<CCharmanderK> Sound kinda went poop there for a sec.
<KrazyNoobs> pony_6548: Man, you foals always make me laugh.
<pony_6548> i'm not foal
<pony_6548> but i like making you laugh anyway :)
<KrazyNoobs> pony_6548: :)
<Java> Luna's scream is... unsettling
<CCharmanderK> Just cleaned out my hard drive some. Now I have 12.5 GB of free space as opposed to the 7 or so I did have.
<KrazyNoobs> pony_6548: Foal, as in g-- typers or lenny face users.
<Java> hahahaha
<CCharmanderK> Piss-for-brains? LOLOLOL
<pony_6548> also my stuff disagree about my foalnes
<KrazyNoobs> (oʖo)
<pony_6548> and this is just funny face o3o
<CCharmanderK> Lennyface is a bad meme that needs to die in a horrible fire.
<KrazyNoobs> The nose looks like a retarded 3.
<CCharmanderK> A gasoline fire, preferrably
<KrazyNoobs> What makes Lennyface awesome is the fact that it can get you in trouble on a few places of the internet.
<KrazyNoobs> ie. le lenny face is bannable on 4chan
<KrazyNoobs> and here
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just started a new Animal Crossing: Wild World game. Only 3 neighbors. Creepy as hell. o3o
<CCharmanderK> Because it's an annoying-as-all-fuck forced meme with no meaning.
<Jmo> Do you know the difference between kickable and bannable?
<KrazyNoobs> CCharmanderK: Exactly.
<pony_6548> meh, pony also bannable at 4chan
<Java> not anymore
<pony_6548> oh already
<CCharmanderK> SPLATTER
<KrazyNoobs> They have a board for us (but it has been taken over by idiots anyway).
<oni_link> I think Im gonna go to bed, night everyone
<KrazyNoobs> Night oni_link!
<CCharmanderK> Yeah, 4Chan's always been a shitpit. I'm not surprised that /mlp/ has become a wretched hive as well.
<Java> night oni_link
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight oni_link
<pony_6548> put that cookie down!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Check out the board for cringe-worthy posts.
<KrazyNoobs> CCharmanderK: Yet, I still frequently visit there. A few times, it can generate a laugh.
<CCharmanderK> KrazyNoobs Rarely ever, though.
<CCharmanderK> Sumi, your master can suck it.
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's rare that's there's actual discussion, but it can also turn into a shithole.
<pony_6548> kill this bucket of junk!
<Java> I avoid 4c. But when I went there I always check Photography. There's actual discussion to be had.... sometimes.

<KrazyNoobs> 4chan /mlp/ might actually be a place I'd enjoy if it were void of so many cloppers.
<CCharmanderK> Naiga
<KrazyNoobs> Of course, I still enjoy it, because there's always going to be a good thread somewhere in that mass of... you know...

<KrazyNoobs2> I was in this body
<pony_6548> what time in Australia for now ? :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 so the diamonds in storage were from creative ?
<Phase4> pony_6548, 00:11 1/1/2013
<KrazyNoobs> WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, BUDDY!!!

<JRP2234> Phase4 Phase4 Phase4
<rdibp> Phase4, did a revolution break out yet?
<Phase4> well the fireworks exploded but that was intentional
<Phase4> rdibp, not yet
<Kipkat07_Scarf> What should my wallpaper be? I narrowed it down to 3 choices: http://goo.gl/ZwtWz , http://goo.gl/CEaDF , or http://goo.gl/5IJy6
<Phase4> JRP2234, JRP2234 JRP2234
<pony_6548> pony wants HAAAAAAAAAM
<JRP2234> i think i know you
<JRP2234> you wonda
<JRP2234> beutifull driver
<rdibp> KrazyNoobs KrazyNoobs KrazyNoobs
<JRP2234> beautifull break foot
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: You got promoted?
<pony_6548> prrrrrrromotion
<rdibp> clap-trap ded
<KrazyNoobs> I live on top of a hill in Noosa, QLD, so I have 3 different firework displays on beaches to watch, one 10km away, one 15km and one 10km the other way.
<Phase4> Kipkat07_Scarf, i'd say one or 3
<Java> Kipkat07_Scarf: The first one... the idea is good but it need better presentation. A block of white and a black font seems.... boring.
<KrazyNoobs> rdibp rdibp rdibp
<KrazyNoobs> That was hard to type
*Kipkat07_Scarf glomps Phase4
*rdibp wipes Phase4
*Phase4 hugs Kipkat07_Scarf back
<Java> rdibp.... Rainbow Dash in Black Phantom?
<rdibp> :D
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, lern 2 tab complete
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I would say congradulations but for the life of me I cant figure if that is how to spell it
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: wut?
<JRP2234> Phase4 follow me to the supernintendo hideout
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, type part of a name and then press tab
<KrazyNoobs> ph + Tab = Phase4
<Phase4> yes
<KrazyNoobs> Niiiiiiiiiiiiice

<KrazyNoobs> That will help with all those names like fhjo1089af or asof091
<pony_6548> i spy a Spy
<KrazyNoobs> Why thank you later?
<KrazyNoobs> Thanks, Phase4
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that's still later
<rdibp> 6 _ 9

<rdibp> spai round here
<KrazyNoobs2> I'm the spy
<KrazyNoobs3> no IM the spy

<KrazyNoobs> clones pls
<rdibp> aSPAI SAPIN MAH SENTRY
<JRP2234> Phase4 follow me to the supernintendo hideout
<Phase4> POOTIS IS SPAI
*KrazyNoobs shoots KrazyNoobs2 and KrazyNoobs3
*Phase4 follows JRP2234
<rdibp> MEDIC
<KrazyNoobs> POOTIS
<KrazyNoobs> POOTIS POOTIS POOTIS POOTIS POOTIS
<Phase4> we fight like men
*KrazyNoobs eats sandvich
<JRP2234> Phase4 big w has the blind bag crystal pony mane 6
<JRP2234> Phase4 al in one box
<Java> To think about it, the clone pond is very useful to help reduce famine. We can clone Scoota... I mean chicken and other farm animals there.
<rdibp> lawl
<KrazyNoobs> The "ending" of S3EP2 where they all became crystals was horrible. Me thinks it was to advertise them crystal Mane 6.
<rdibp> KrazyNoobs: everything put into MLP is an advertising gimmick
<Java> KrazyNoobs: Promoting a new line of toys.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: do you think this is a good wallpaper? http://wallpoper.com/images/00/42/36/55/butterfly-shining_00423655.jpg or rather this: http://stuffpoint.com/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/image/83670-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-flutter-black.png
<JRP2234> Phase4 youl never find my secret hideout where me a sb live
<KrazyNoobs> I know, Hasbro sucks.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> yay... not a total linkwall failure
<rdibp> Hasbro sucks too. Studio B is where its at!
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Laziness wins again
<JRP2234> the people who make show are canadian
<KrazyNoobs> Hasbro is the only thing preventing MLP from being at its full potential.
<KrazyNoobs> But Hasbro has to be involved in it... they own the entire My Little Pony franchise.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: what then?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> what if the show reached full potential?
<KrazyNoobs> Kipkat07_Scarf: Derpy. nuff said
<rdibp> KrazyNoobs: i think we mightve syumbled across a parodox. :O
<rdibp> stumbled*
<Derpy> 6_9
<KrazyNoobs> Der
<KrazyNoobs> p
<rdibp> ohai erpy :)
<KrazyNoobs> Hi Depry
<rdibp> Derpy*
<KrazyNoobs> Hi Derpy
<KrazyNoobs> dem two spellin errors
<SpadeKyurem> To this day I fail to see how Derpy was considered pffensive
<SpadeKyurem> *offensive
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: Cos people are stupid.
<KrazyNoobs> Handicapped people are offensive, somehow. Wouldn't that make handicapped viewers of the show feel bad?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: The Derpy crisis was proof that the general population is unprepared for MLP's full potential.
<SpadeKyurem> Kipkat07_Scarf: Or the fact people are retarded
<Java> KrazyNoobs: We have to accept the good and the bad. Just like Transformers.
<SpadeKyurem> How the hell was Derpy making fun of ANYONE
<Java> in the end without Hasbro we won't get ponies
<SpadeKyurem> I fail to see how
<rdibp> Welcome to Earth! Where shows like Family Guy and South Park can get away with anything. But, if you show a cross-eyed pony on a kids show, WE WILL SLAM IT!
<KrazyNoobs> Kipkat07_Scarf: And if the bronies are the only thing keeping My Little Pony from dying (which gives money to Hasbro, which is all they care about), why not at least do what is best for them?
<SpadeKyurem> rdibp: Thank you
<KrazyNoobs> What would happen if The Hub bought My little Pony off of Hasbro?
<Java> KrazyNoobs: Political Correctness.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Soon we will march on the Capitol. We can force their hand. Once we have a first world power's support... we will be unstoppable.
<KrazyNoobs> not possible, but what would happen?
<Java> Brony world order?
<pony_6548> hAM!
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Java: exactly.
<SpadeKyurem> You know why Derpy is "offensive" because over protective soccermoms OVER ANYALYZE EVERYTHING
<rdibp> kipkat07_Scarf: this is why people hate us XD
<SpadeKyurem> It looks offensive, oh it MUST be mocking soneone!
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: Hasbro needs to ignore them.
<MadSurge> rdibp: people still watch Family Guy and South Park? Haven't those shows jumped the shark a million years ago?
<JRP2234> [22:59] <@JRP2234> SuperBrony64 i stole your cheese
<JRP2234> [23:04] <@SuperBrony64> dat mah cheese D:
<SpadeKyurem> NO IT ISNT YOU STUPID CHUCKLENUTS, just because it LOOKS offensive doenst mean it isnt
<SpadeKyurem> God humanity is retarded sometimes...
<KrazyNoobs> JRP2234: since WHEN were you mods?
<KrazyNoobs> O_o
<rdibp> MadSurge: I said shows LIKE amily guy and south park
<JRP2234> nevars
<Kipkat07_Scarf> rdibp: Im insane. The fandom is filled with sane fellows but Im not one of them.
<SpadeKyurem> also rdibp brings up a good point
<pony_6548> mods 6_9
<KrazyNoobs> JRP2234: What is with the @ in your name then? HM?
<MadSurge> rdibp: you mean every cartoon from Adult Swim? :D
<JRP2234> its means i was op
<rdibp> sort of :P
<KrazyNoobs> Futurama is in Season 7 and is still good
<NekoC> Hello!
<SpadeKyurem> Why is a cross eyed pony considered offensive when Family Guy can get away with shit
<KrazyNoobs> HI NekoC
<rdibp> hai NekoC
<NekoC> How is everypony?
<pony_6548> when you got bigger balls on size this @
<MadSurge> And yet noone says anything to Adventure Time, despite being for kids and showing way worse imagery
<rdibp> i don't even watch new episodes of family guy anymore
<Kipkat07_Scarf> once we can implement the brony world order, we can actually follow "Love & Tolerace"
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem: Because overprotective moms who just want to find a reason to complain to someone or something don't have young kids that watch that show (DUH!)
<SpadeKyurem> You want to know why aliens havent invaded yet? because they take ONE look at us and turn RIGHT AROUND AND LEAVE
<Kipkat07_Scarf> till then... we are an unorganised minority.
<rdibp> I dont believe in Love and Tolerence. It was just created by someone on 4-Chan to stop all the arguments
