<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: use a slightly darker shade of the current color youre usng, make sur to pay attention to how a real shadow would contour on what your drawing, and remeber always use a seperate layer if your using a program
<cratorkid> it give you an idea tho
<Wrek> 05Pudgeotto: stell a spoiler, still covered by the rule
<killerpony7733> ^What he said

<Chrysalis> Saturn why?
<MadSurge> Pudgeotto: or other weapons that don't use bullets
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Nice
<Ponies47> Saturn: Yay :P
<cratorkid> Saturn: sounds cool, anypony near you?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Saturn: dont lose your things again
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> god laptops are hard to play with no mouse
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ikr
<Ponies47> ^
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ^^
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Isn't that the true
<Very_Silly_Filly> I hate laptop keypads
<hen3ry> I have a trackball specifically for my laptop...
<Saturn> 08,01its cool because even though im in the bmiddle of effing n.owehre, i still get 3G signal
<hen3ry> they don't even make this model anymore tho, so I'm gonna have a sad someday
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MASF123: I'm an American Brony born to a family of both Americans and Canadians.
<Ponies47> Saturn: Ok that's awesome ^^
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Where you heading again?
<MadSurge> Saturn: I might come to BUCK after all, but I need at least a week to know (they might notify me for a part time job)
<Saturn> 08,01but whenever i go through a dunnel, or the verges are high, i need to reconnect, because the signal drops
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But yeah, so I tried to learn French but keep skipping out on classes and thus keep forgetting stuffs ;~;
<Saturn> 08,01im heading to a pony meet in edinburgh
<MadSurge> Saturn: hope the last tickets don't run out

<MadSurge> :O VORTIGAUNT!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hola, amigo/a que tal?
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's pretty much all the spanish I know
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I know, but I could use some extra money :P
<hen3ry> why would anypony need a cordless trackball. The whole point of a trackball is it stays in one place...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<hen3ry> stupid logitech.
<Saturn> 08,01madsurge: unless we suddenly get 150 guests in the next ffew week, they won't 
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> silly Phase
<MadSurge> Saturn: excellent :$
<Saturn> 08,01er, 150 attendees, even

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i remember now
<Saturn> 08,01the venue can hold about double that
<killerpony7733> Saturn: What's the current or closest estimate of how many that has bought tickets so far?
<Saturn> 08,01just over 400
<killerpony7733> Thats pretty huge actually
<Ponies47> Saturn: Wow. Lots of bronies :P
<Shamroc> that poor flamin combine.......
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ikr
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: And like many others i'm with a high chance going to be there :)
<Saturn> 08,01which is fantastic; i was hoping to reach 400 by the end of the month. to reach 400 with a month to go is b rilliant
<Ponies47> killerpony7733: NO ME! :'(

<Pudgeotto> later Shamroc
*Pudgeotto yawns
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i think i found one of the most dumbest comment left by a brony
<Pudgeotto> what is it?
<Ponies47> What?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: There are a lot of retarded Bronies out there
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he said that a guy who got leukemia deserved it because he didnt love and tolerate ppl
<Pudge|Sleepy> wow
<Pudge|Sleepy> are you serious?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> -_(\
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: That is actually very stupid
<SpeedBlah> Wrek?
<Phase4> 00,02where do i go?
<Ponies47> That's just sick -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: go under the tube
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Silly Phase
<Pudge|Sleepy> wow
<Wrek> 05every group of people, no matter wich one will always have a guaranteed dumbfuck.
<Pudge|Sleepy> but
<Ponies47> ^
<Wrek> 05unless its a closed society
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: go back to the end and crouch
<Pudge|Sleepy> Bronies were supposed to be different
<Wrek> 05where there's a bit more control
<Wrek> 05but even then chances are high
<oni_link> HL2??
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yes oni_link
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Same goes with the very small but vocal minority of each fandom that people base their views on us on
<SpeedBlah> Not HL2. Half-Life 2
<Euls> whats going on?
<Pudge|Sleepy> But still, even if you're not a brony, there's something called being a decent human being
<Pudge|Sleepy> saying someone deserved to get leukemia is just inhumane and heartless
<oni_link> Whats going on today/tonight?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> nuthin
<Ponies47> Ohai oni_link
<Euls> i mean besides some hate
<Very_Silly_Filly> But yeah, there are seriously some people out there that make be being a brony make me look like I made a big mistake
<SpeedBlah> Half-Life 2 doing
<cratorkid> hey oni_link
*oni_link hugs Ponies47

<oni_link> Lil_B: Oh goodness :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm well phase is possible ded

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> god i cant type today
<hen3ry> I own my last name.com. (Advantages to having an unusual last name hehe)
<oni_link> hen3ry: where did you go for that?

<killerpony7733> shmoopy: You are xxmoopyxx right?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: nah
<Phase4> 00,02also is that the right way to do it?
<Phase4> 00,02with crowbar?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: i think i confused that part with another part
<Pudge|Sleepy> You must construct additional pylons
<hen3ry> crowbar is always right way to kill anything that's not immortal. If you don't have tactical nukes anyway
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya crowbars are the way to do it
<cratorkid> Pudge|Sleepy: if my mum caught me with an energy drink she'd shed.mov me
<shmoopy> Well yeah but somepony was using my user nickname cause i hate when it says that
<Pudge|Sleepy> cratorkid: is she one of those people who believe they are bad for the heart?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, someone was yesterday apparently
<oni_link> cratorkid: whoa, how come?
<Vinco> And now it's raining
<Phase4> 00,02i hold down the crowbar button
<Phase4> 00,02they die
<Phase4> 00,02you cant explain that
<Pudge|Sleepy> being shed.mov'd. that's....not pleasant
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: It's Gordon freeman, there's no explanation
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> but you just did Phase4
<hen3ry> crowbar + force + skull usually is a good explanation.
<Eulshy> yep hell for me
<MadSurge> Pudge|Sleepy: you mean you've been forced to watch it?
<Pudge|Sleepy> Lol what I love the .mov series
<therainbowvortex> moopy are ya here

<Pudge|Sleepy> they realize i'm a fully grown adult now
<Pudge|Sleepy> and I can make my own decisions
<killerpony7733> xxMoopyxx: It's a problem that happens when your chat crashes or something and you only refresh the chat and not the whole browser and freezes the user for a bit
<hen3ry> so now they hire a PI to watch you, right?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yay, Barnacles randomly appearing
<oni_link> with me, it was the same case as Pudge|Sleepy :P
<xxMoopyxx> oh ok so i can refresh it?

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase is doing sorta better than Wrek
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yeah wreky was dying left and right :D
<Ponies47> My brother is a jerk. He keeps saying I'm bucked in highschool and I'm gonna be a drop out. He just thinks he's better then me -_-
<MadSurge> Don't be sad Phase4, I'd probably be worse at it than you :D
<oni_link> Don't know what to go for. I thought I was going to be a Automotive engineer, but I suck at math. I have a passion for music and Video Games and I don't do anything with that. :I
<Texasboykc09> Ponies47 i was in 9th grade last school year and it wasnt bad
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ahhh this room
<Pudge|Sleepy> oni_link: do you make your own music?
<Ponies47> Texasboykc09: Still my brother is a jerk -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: if you go into the vent them manhacks came from, there should be a cache
<oni_link> Pudge|Sleepy: At the moment, I just do 8bit stuff. But I have basic music knowlegde. I am also a drummer.
<Pudge|Sleepy> try to become a video game music composer?
<Phase4> 00,02had to google stuf

<Texasboykc09> Ponies47 i have people that are jerks, but dont let that stop you
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: why?
<Phase4> 00,02cause
<cratorkid> Ponies47: normal , so is everybody else, tip, friends are easy if ur in a club or sport, remember, you are a freshmen, not a big-dog 8th, so dont bother a senior, unles your in one of those anti bully law schools where they file a police report if you so much as look at someone funny
<oni_link> My friends told me I should but I just never acted on it. I guess I should give it a try though. What exactly does one major in to do that though?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Insert Epic song
<Pudge|Sleepy> oni_link: I'm not sure to be honest. :S
<Ponies47> Texasboykc09: My brother just thinks he's better then me. Yeah and I'm the brother who had to repeat algebra twice -_-

<Ponies47> Pudge|Sleepy: I'm a pretty big person (tall and such) but I suck at sports I know the football ocach is gonna annoy the buck outta me trying to make me join. NO WAY! :[
<Lil_B> I never played Horror games or scray games before so these Zombies with their noises really scared the shit out of me when I first heard them... and iw as 18 XD

<Pudge|Sleepy> Ponies47: okay okay...calm down. :$
<MadSurge> Wth where did that zombie come from
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he was under the water
<Ponies47> oni_link: The only thing I went was the 8th grade graduation cermony. And I didn't want to go. But I was forced to -_-
<killerpony7733> Can't wait till he gets the chopper gun on the airboat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i wonder if Phase will get stuck
<Ponies47> Pudge|Sleepy: Ok then :P
<AdamTheDuck> reveres driving like a boss
<oni_link> I really want my knee to get better, I need to get back to skating and drumming. I miss it all so much. I also got bigger... I need to run. Well I can run with a knee brace on but I've been making excuses for too long.
<MadSurge> Now do it all backwards!
<Pudge|Sleepy> I'm just a huge football fanatic is all
<DrGanjalf> Beat the game backwards!
<oni_link> Ponies47: I was soo like that, this is really trippy.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: you gotta get off the boat to open the gate
<Vinco> This is the greatest driving I've seen in a while
<Very_Silly_Filly> I find football boring IMO, I prefer motorsports
<Pudge|Sleepy> I hated the boat sections
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> how
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i like how i figure it otu during the lag XD
<oni_link> Vinco: not sure if joking or serious

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: hold it down
<Ponies47> oni_link: I didn't have that much fun. It was boring and then I had to go to a dance after the cermony. The dance was ok. -_-
<MadSurge> Anyone ever heard of the Kickboat Saga? :D
<Pudge|Sleepy> Phase4: I can see that by your driving skills :D

<Ponies47> Pudge|Sleepy: Yeah. I hope that happens for me. I had nobofy to hang with in middle school :(
<oni_link> Ponies47: If its like how it was for me, it will be and you shouldnt ignore those people that make an effort to befriend you. I know I had this period where I was putting up a wall due to bad experiences but then I saw that they were genuinely trying to be my friend.
<therainbowvortex> my dady never huged me

<MadSurge> You gatta find your way in Phase4 :D
<oni_link> And yeah :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pudge|Sleepy is that a boy or a girl?
<Ponies47> oni_link: yeah

<oni_link> Ponies47: You'll be fine, ignore the obvious dicks of your populous and you should be fine. Don't be afraid to interact :$
<MadSurge> Pudge|Sleepy: awww :) but please use the DerpyMe site if the link is that long

<Texasboykc09> hey PrincessLuna
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi PrincessLuna
<Ponies47> oni_link: I don't know if I can or not. I have always been very shy :(
<Pudge|Sleepy> dat stream is getting further and further behind
<Midnight_Tempest> so many people asking about the new season... i find it silly
<Ponies47> ^
<PrincessLuna> i still on deployment, in Greece now
<Phase4> 00,02imagine behing that guy
<Phase4> 00,02the one who shot me
<oni_link> Ponies47: Find people who share your interests. talk to them about those interests. and in time, you will feel more comfortable with talking with people.
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4... your stream is so far behind XD
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<Pudge|Sleepy> it really is
<Ponies47> oni_link: Don't really have that many intrests thats the problem. I pretty much have no talent at all :(
<Pudge|Sleepy> like
<oni_link> PrincessLuna: What branch are you in?
<PrincessLuna> Navy :)
<oni_link> Ponies47: Is there something you want to try?
<Pudge|Sleepy> its like we're watching a badly buffering youtube vid and chatting about random things :P
<oni_link> PrincessLuna: Oooh! I send my thanks to you :)
<killerpony7733> Pudge|Sleepy: Sorta what streaming is tbh :D
<Ponies47> oni_link: Not that I could think of. Like I said I pretty much hate doing anything that's gonna make me waste my time
<Pudge|Sleepy> killerpony7733: haha in some cases yes :D
<alexxm> hey guys
<Pudge|Sleepy> hey alexxm
<Malavolent> Ello there.
*Ponies47 Hugs alexxm "Hi!"
<oni_link> Ponies47: But is there anything that you dont see as a waste of time or anything you think you will have fun with?
<Texasboykc09> hey alexxm
<Pudge|Sleepy> any canadians in here?
<Ponies47> oni_link: I have no idea :(

<alexxm> hey PrincessLuna how've you been
<Pudge|Sleepy> alexxm: sleepy, but otherwise great
<Texasboykc09> just need to go to bed soon
<PrincessLuna> so busy :(
<oni_link> Ponies47: Well for me, I am a Metalhead first and foremost. And I really like music. So my obvious choice was to sign up for a music class. And alot of my friends are musicians, and people who were in my classes.
<AdamTheDuck> worst time to freeze...
<Malavolent> Suddenly, DED.
<therainbowvortex> good bye every pony
<Malavolent> I'm doing well alexxm, how about you?
<oni_link> bye therainbowvortex

<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Phase4> 00,02forgot i was opening a door
<Ponies47> oni_link: Like I said. I have no idea what I like or what my talent was. I bet if I was a pony I would still be a blank flank :(
<Ponies47> *talent is
<PrincessLuna> uea ive been deployed :(
<oni_link> Ponies47: There has to be at least one thing you want to do. :) you probably just overlook it
<Major> PrincessLuna: what are we even doing there anymore =_=
<Ponies47> oni_link: Not that I could think of. I'm just not sure :(
<oni_link> Ponies47: You still have alot of time, I think it will come to you when the time is right. Just be patient.
<CrimsonPhoenix> So I watched the MLP Panel and I must say, there was a lot of stupid question
<red_ony> spray fire is best fire
<PrincessLuna> sitting on our hands :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> and none of them cleared something iimportant
<Ponies47> oni_link: I hope :(
<Malavolent> Ponies47: Try learning new things.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> well im off, thanks for stream Phase4
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix what sort of questions would you have asked
<oni_link> Ponies47: Like the mask salsesman in Ocarina of Time said, "Just have faith." :)
<alexxm> bye Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<Phase4> 00,02LATER Spectrum_Rush|Zzz

<oni_link> bye Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's a rumor about season 3 having only 13 episode, is this true?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> lol silly Phase4
<alexxm> bye Pudge|Sleepy
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> nite
<Ponies47> Malavolent: hmmm. Problem is I think everything else but computer is pretty much a waste of time. IT'S TRUE I DO HAVE PROBLEM! :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> that rumor has been bugging me for quite a while
<Ponies47> *Everything else is a waste of time
<oni_link> I don't know of anything when it comes to season 3.
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix are they doing any more panels
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't think so. Well not in Comic-Con
<oni_link> Ponies47: Aha! Computers. theres your answer.
<Ponies47> oni_link: ok then :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> because they do have other product to advertise
<Ponies47> oni_link: No. Not working on em. Just using em. Like Internet and such :(
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47 What are your hobbies? What do you do in your free time?
<Kammerjunk> "Close your eyes," they said. "Just for a second," they said.
<Phase4> 00,02i think i know the problem
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: Don't have any hobbies :/
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: What? O.O
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I fell asleep, is my point.
<oni_link> Ponies47: There has to be something you like, everyone has something.
<Kammerjunk> ...He likes ponies?
<Phase4> 00,02settings were all wrong
<Ponies47> oni_link: Not that I could think of :(
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: I TOTALLY misunderstood. I have a filthy mind sometimes... Sorry.
<Kammerjunk> oh
<Kammerjunk> my
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47 what about computer games?
<Ponies47> Yeah like somebody is gonna be friends with some who likes MLP right on the spot -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ded
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: Don't play em that much
<oni_link> Ponies47: Well that should come up later on when you know this person better.
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: Basically, anything you do for fun on a regular basis that isn't working towards a later goal.
<AdamTheDuck> is the stream still lagging for anyone else?
<Ponies47> oni_link: That's what I was planning to do. Get to know each other and then tell em
<Kammerjunk> AdamTheDuck: Yup.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so much buffers
<Texasboykc09> AdamTheDuck me too
<oni_link> Ponies47: Shoot, if I had FiM back in highschool, I would have been an open brony and sooner.
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk: I really don't do that much. I just sit around at home alot and chat with you guys and such.
*Flaria hugs Kammerjunk.
<red_ony> that is what I do to waste time..
<Flaria> Hallo~
<CrimsonPhoenix> What's going on in here now?
<Alpha-Omega_> Bored
<Kammerjunk> Hugging is uncomfortable.
<Flaria> Sorry.
<Ponies47> oni_link: It took me a few months to finally start telling poeple
<Kammerjunk> 'S all cool.
<XAX> so everyone else is getting the lovely buffer quite a bit as well?
<oni_link> XAX yes we are
<alexxm> i am
<AdamTheDuck> XAX yeah we all are
<Texasboykc09> XAX yep
<Kammerjunk> It really is, though. I don't know how to act is social situations.
<oni_link> Ponies47: I still need to find a way to tell my parents.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, best advice, don't talk about it
<Vinco> Kammerjunk, I'm the same way
<XAX> I presume my parents already know. I set the family PC wallpaper to a poni wallpaper slideshow
<CrimsonPhoenix> just watch it and do what you want
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: really? why though?
<Ponies47> oni_link: My mom knows. Shes cool with it. I haven't broke the news to my dad yet atleast,
<Kammerjunk> I didn't really tell my parents. Didn't seem like a big deal.
<red_ony> Why would you actively tell anyone unless they ask ....
<CrimsonPhoenix> just don't confess like you would if you would be gay or something
<red_ony> most people could not care less
<Kammerjunk> I guess they found out when I had an MLP poster on my wall.
<CrimsonPhoenix> just think about it you're confessing about watching a cartoon
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: hahahah XD im sorry but that made me laugh. and i wont.
<CrimsonPhoenix> a cartoon
<Ponies47> I have 2 pony shirts and alot my stuff ponyfied. So yeah. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> you know how silly it sounds
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, I watch cartoons anyway, and they don't give a damn.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like HEH I'M WATCHING SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Its not as big of a deal as its made out to be pretty much huh :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> exactly
<Alpha-Omega_> I tried to draw on my iPad. It did not turn out well at all
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not like you're gay or something, it's a cartoon and you should act as if you're watching any other cartoon
<oni_link> I don't think I can confidently keep merch and clothing though. I
<oni_link> just don't.
<CrimsonPhoenix> if they question just say, it's a damn good cartoon
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02something else time
<Ponies47> I'm still a bit nervous about telling me dad but on sunday we are going to the theme peak and I'm gonna be wearing my DJ PON-3 shirt if he asks, well I guess I shoudl just tell him :/
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix: Which it is
<Kammerjunk> The reason it's considered a big deal of sorts, however, is that society as a whole will inevitably judge you for liking that show.
<XAX> I had a McDonalds Pinkie Pie clipped to my school bag for like... a month.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: So far it hasnt come up. I dont think ill rock the boat then.
<AdamTheDuck> +Phase4 bastion time?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> XAX: hmm?
<Ponies47> *park
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase needs to play Zombie Escape on CSS :(
<Phase4> 00,02thing is i want to play riven
<Phase4> 00,02but shizu streams that
<XAX> The only reason I stopped hanging it from my bad is because someone stole the clip -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, just dont say I'm a brony
<XAX> hanging it from my bag*
<CrimsonPhoenix> just say something like "I enjoy the cartoon, so what"
<Kammerjunk> I watched a video of a guy telling his dad. I think his dad thought it was a joke.
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: My guess is. He's gonna get the parody of DJ PON-3 an djust ask me who bought it and where did I get it.
<Ponies47> *and just
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix is right. Just say something along the lines of what he said. Be causal and don't make a scene. That pretty much is the theme I am getting
<Hat> Why do you want to tell people
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link got the idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> just answer him honestly and just say you enjoy the show
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: awesome. I feel more confident now.
<Kammerjunk> Good to know I'm not the only one who didn't say anything because it wasn't such a big deal.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Here's my story
<oni_link> I think its only a big deal if we make it so.
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: You are always filled with such good advice. Now I feal better :)
<Kammerjunk> However, I still carry a few USB sticks around for whenevera anyone asks about the show.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I watched the show, save tons of shit about it in my computer, I BOUGHT Brushables
<Kammerjunk> You know, music, art, couple of episodes.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk is a recruiter :P but thats cool.
<CrimsonPhoenix> put them in front of my tv they notice it, they asked why I bought these and I just answered.
<Kammerjunk> Ah like helpin' the pony folk.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The show is awesome and I support them for it
<oni_link> I love this community ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> then they were like ok
<Ponies47> The only pony merchandise is 2 shirts. Thats it :P
<Texasboykc09> Phase4 the stream keeps biffering
<Alpha-Omega> Yup
<Texasboykc09> buffering
<Phase4> 00,02not sure i can fix that
<Phase4> 00,02happens this time of night
<alexxm> the only merch i have is an appljacl and rainbow dash brushie
<Kammerjunk> I have 2 Dashie shirt and a Luna shirt. I also have all of the Mane 6 from Toys'r'Us EXCEPT FOR APPLEJACK.
<DrGanjalf> Geez, All it all it's still just a cartoon, but with ponies. I also watch AT, which BTW, should be far more parental-concerning.
<Kammerjunk> I can never find Applejack, seriously.
<oni_link> I have a McDonalds Applejack toy that I bought before I was a fan as a joke but now I don't know what too do with it.
<Hat> AJ out of stock?!
<Hat> Unacceptable
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Kammerjunk> And here I thought she was underrated.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kammerjunk, internet
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Wait you can find MLP FIM toys at Toys'r'US here in denmark?
<Ponies47> I has nopony toys what so ever just 2 shirts
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if reboot and try from linux
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, but Denmark.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's how I got my rarity
<Phase4> 00,02or do something else in windows
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm in Canada
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Yup. There's one not far away.
<Alpha-Omega> Need opinion
<oni_link> Phase4: what can you do in windows?
<Phase4> 00,02could play ksp but its abit of a time sink
<alexxm> Alpha-Omega what on
<Kammerjunk> Well, from me anyway.
<Kammerjunk> In Sjælland.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Might check that :D
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, games, thats about it
<Alpha-Omega> Story
<Wrek> 05what game should i play?

<killerpony7733> Actually knowing geiger counter noises what you hear is relatively small doses of radiation
<MegaMoonShine> Extreme dodgeball!
<Kammerjunk> Gee, what'd you expect.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Irl the geiger counter should be going super crazy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<MegaMoonShine> He touched the core

<derpy_pony> the rest of the people in this chatroom is basically one guy and his cat....and a few auto response scripts
<Very_Silly_Filly> My cat is ded, so
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Honestly my OC doesn't have a special talent, My cutiemark is more of a symbol to refer to me as a person
<Kammerjunk> ERROR: Invalid string. Response not available.

<SpeedBlah> Kleiner is crazy dick who like sexex
<Very_Silly_Filly> sub06905: They are, but with no lag, you need a decent PC and connection
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kliener is a 60 year old pedo
<Lil_B> sub06905 they are easy to host, but when you don't have a decent PC and a good connection, it will lag for everyone :/
<SpeedBlah> *sexist

<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: o rly
<Very_Silly_Filly> For my first month or so, I was lurking around
<alexxm> of course it is
<Lil_B> I wish you could modify Steam i a way to make a window frome the Overlay permanent even when you are playing... I want to have the chat there XD
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Not popular enough to have spam filled mane chat unless it's movie nights :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ded
<DrGanjalf> camper
<Very_Silly_Filly> killerpony7733: That's because: 1. These mods are useful, they can do their job well and 2. We have good community anyway :P
<Lil_B> I think I'm between 1/4 and 1/5 of a year now...
*sub06905 hasent played terraria in awhile
<Very_Silly_Filly> 1 year today, hardly recognise anyone here from around a year ago :s
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Yeah the more loyal and always on despite not being movie night, is low compared to the ones only coming for movie nights
<Lil_B> sub06905 as far as I know we have 5 or 6 people here who play Terraria
<Lil_B> killerpony7733 not to mention the ones that come here for new episodes XD
<Skylerarmor> do you guys go on bronystate website to watch live stream movies and stuff?
<Marky> I play it from time to time
<sub06905> Lil_B: i only know 3 people that play terraria
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Still i got a nice comfy little channel i'm mod in along with our friendly Satty :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> I remember when Saturn was a normal member

<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: I may have been there during that but i was really confused back then :D
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: It must be fun applying to be a mod :D
<Skylerarmor> Minecraft?
<sub06905> ^
<Very_Silly_Filly> I probably would apply, but I have to admit I'm not the most mature guy on earth
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> man i wanna be a mod ;_;
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: i actually asked satty about having a regular mod or something like that in the chat i'm mod for now and he made me a mod for the channel :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Plus Luna has my favourite text colour, so I'd have to contest with her for the colour :3
<killerpony7733> We aren't big but we got a tightly nit group of people in the channel :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> And you know that when I recognise about 97% of you all

<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: What code was Linux work on?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bios? or whatever
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly I think Linux is just C
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh
<Very_Silly_Filly> That makes it slightly easier
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly *Based on C
<Very_Silly_Filly> Considering I'm learning c++
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or planning to learn it
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly me too... if I find a good way to learn it...
<Very_Silly_Filly> If I learn C, I'll probably create my own OS with Linux
<AdamTheDuck> just wondering what kind of jobs does programming lead to?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Game development, OS development, program development
<Very_Silly_Filly> Basically anything to do with computers
<Lil_B> I just saw that I have 2 Terminator Parodies in my Picture Folders... one is the Terminator as Bayonetta and one is Sweete Belle as the Terminator

<Lil_B> yeah Crhysalis Design is awesome... I really like the colors
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> wow. when i was 6-7 all i played were ancient spaceship games
<Very_Silly_Filly> Diablo 2 hell is retarded unless you have like 6-8 people
<ponyloverforeva> alexxm: im fine ghow are you? :3
<sub06905> 007 goldeneye n64 will remain my favorite FPS
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: And for a Sorcerer, it's terrible. Every mob is immune to at least 2 schools and highly resistant to a third.
<alexxm> i'm good ponyloverforeva
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> o yah, i remember playing goldeneye at a friends place, good times
<ponyloverforeva> what game is this?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have goldeneye

<alexxm> how long is an episode supposed to be
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: a bit short
<Lil_B> sub06905 I wish I had that, but it never came out in germany :/ (the consors wouldn't let it...)
<sub06905> is Valve made a tv show season 1 will end on episode 2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Oh right, Germany's a bit silly with that.
<Kammerjunk> Dat insurance guy.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Australias the same
<Kammerjunk> HAAAAAX
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haaaaax
<Very_Silly_Filly> DAMMIT, Kammerjunk
<sub06905> HAAAXXXX
<Kammerjunk> Hah!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> *throws monitor at chat*
*Very_Silly_Filly throws HDMI TV at moniter*
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Very_Silly_Filly: curses, foiled again

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> in some countires 3 is considered gods number. valve msut be the devil
<Brony4Eva> Why do these bleed?
<Kammerjunk> I actually still have one of those old CRT monitors somewhere.

<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm currently on one now
<Very_Silly_Filly> New! Supports windows 95!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> defend the citizens, schnell!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Very_Silly_Filly: woah
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Dude, wow.
<Brony4Eva> Very_Silly_Filly dont tell me you have windows 95
<XAX> Kammerjunk: My old computer next to my new one has a CRT
<Very_Silly_Filly> Brony4Eva: No, my moniter is brand new for Windows 95
<SpeedBlah> I have Windows NT
<Very_Silly_Filly> So released in '94 or 95
<Brony4Eva> Oh ok then
<Kammerjunk> I can't believe you can still buy CRT monitors.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Not a very old one though. Probably about '04...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> valve should just cancel hl3 and go straight to hl4
<Very_Silly_Filly> That effectively means my moniter is almost 20 years old
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, why would anyone buy a CRT monitor these days.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: Because they're cheap
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Save it for another 20. It'll be worth a fortune.

<Kammerjunk> Silly me, MW3 is old.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MW2 was kewl
<Kammerjunk> The first CoD was better.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<SpeedBlah> I played all CoD expect first and MW3
<DrGanjalf> Kammerjunk: First CoD, or first MW?
<Kammerjunk> DrGanjalf: The very first CoD.
<SpeedBlah> And CoD 3
<SpeedBlah> Russian
<Kammerjunk> I never played CoD, actually. Pre-MW, I've played CoD, CoD:UO and CoD 2.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vortiguants need a new god now

<Chocobunny> Talk about falling for the game. ZING.
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ensemble sure did their best with a Console Rts
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wth is that
<Chocobunny> Kammerjunk: That's way scary coincidence. I'm also 16, but I still have AoE 2 and 3 on my PC (weird fact: my step-dad used to be one of the greatest AoE players in Sweden).
<DrGanjalf> I never was really into C&C series.
<Chocobunny> ^^
<SpeedBlah> Gordon is gnome
<Kammerjunk> Chocobunny: Oh yeah, I still have AoE lying around somewhere on my fileserver.
<Kammerjunk> Not sure which one.
<Chocobunny> Lol.
<Kammerjunk> I'm guessing 3.
<Lil_B> AoE2 is a huge chunk of my Childhood XD I pretty much did nothing but playing RTS games :/
<DrGanjalf> But i respect Westwood Studios for their Blade Runner adaptation
<Kammerjunk> Wait, the Halo MMO was originally going to be titled Titan?
<Kammerjunk> That's funny. That's what Blizzard is calling their "next-gen MMO" project.
<DrGanjalf> Kammerjunk: Uhh no? Titan is developed by Blizz, right?
<Kammerjunk> DrGanjalf: Yeah, it was cancelled.
<SpeedBlah> Vort said "talalal"?!
<Kammerjunk> While back.
<DrGanjalf> Oh.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Happy Face
<Lil_B> This Pan is like Willson
<Kandarihu> What's up with making MMOs based on FPS franchises. There was going to be a Tribes MMO, but that got dumped in favor of Tribes: Ascend
<DrGanjalf> Kandarihu: Because MMO = munnies
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: RPG games are just overdone MMO-wise. So now Blizzard's making Titan, CCP is making Dust 516.
<Kammerjunk> I'm a bit peeved that Dust 516 is purely PS3, though. I mean, the PC community made CCP what it is.
<DrGanjalf> Good Guy Vortigaunt
<Jim> Guild Wars 2 :D
<SpeedBlah> Vort gonna die
<SpeedBlah> Happy end
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> isnt Bungie making a mmo too?
<DrGanjalf> nope.avi
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Chocobunny> I wish Bethesda could make the next Elder Scrolls game more like Daggerfall. ;_;
<DrGanjalf> The Vort Will Live *yaaaaaaay*
<Chocobunny> Skyrim sucked, IMHO.
<jonthedrummerpony> fail
<SpeedBlah> GOOMBA STOMP
<Kammerjunk> >http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1498/ - MFW I'm the only EVE Online player here.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> that vortiguant is the most l33t of his species
<Lil_B> Ultima Online is now For Free
<Jim> GW2 is going to eat my life
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of free, I'm surprised SW:TOR is still in business.
<DrGanjalf> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> IKR
<Chocobunny> BRB, going to get an energy drink.
<DrGanjalf> Kammerjunk: Give it time
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, it'll be free eventually.
<Kammerjunk> They all become free eventually.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its funny how the game has a platform collecting system
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> even tho its a third person mmo
<DrGanjalf> There can be only one P2P!
<Lil_B> I'm surpised FF11 and FF14 are still around :/
<sub06905> Free 2 Play, Pay 2 Win
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<DrGanjalf> free 2 pay
<Jim> I quit WoW simply because it was p2p
<Kandarihu> F2P isn't always P2W
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol ded
<Major> xD
<Kammerjunk> Dallarum - ded
<sub06905> ded
<Jim> with GW2, you buy the game once, then it's F2P
<Jim> It does have a cash shop too, but it only has cosmetic items, also you don't need to use real life money in it, you could spend ingame gold to buy the gems for the store
<DrGanjalf> My brother is forward to buy GW2
<Kammerjunk> I had never played GW1. Then I bought Nightfall and Factions Collector's Editions and started playing.
<Kammerjunk> Because I could.
<Jim> which I think is a cool feature
<Kandarihu> What would be a good name for that model? Buy 2 Play?
<DrGanjalf> Buy & Play
<Kammerjunk> How about "a game"?
<Jim> Isn't that just a normal game model?
<Kammerjunk> Unless it's free to play or subscription, it's just a game.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oo music
<DrGanjalf> Jim: It used to be :'(
<DrGanjalf> But then... DLCs!
<Kammerjunk> Also, I'm glad there's no "pay to win" scenario.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> with EA there are no such things as Games
<DrGanjalf> online passess...
<Kammerjunk> EA Games - Ruin everything
<DrGanjalf> the horror, the horror...
<sub06905> pffft... Online passes
<GilDash|Unreal2k4> EA Games - It's in the money.
<Kammerjunk> DrGanjalf: What about paying to reserve a copy of an unreleased game?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> And Then Came the Antlion Guardian
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, why? Are you paying to reserve the bytes?
<Kandarihu> E... A... Sports. If you've seen it a million times, it's in the game.
<sub06905> Combine EA Games and Activision
<Kammerjunk> NO.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> EA actually stands for Evil Assholes
<sub06905> :D
<DrGanjalf> Kammerjunk: You mean pre-orders or Kickstarster?
<Kammerjunk> DrGanjalf: I mean pre-orders. Paying to reserve the goddamn bytes.
<Kammerjunk> I could understand it with physical copies, because they only have so many physical copies, but not here.

<DrGanjalf> Speaking about voice acting: Anyone here played Thief series?

<Rainbow> Sup.
<Kandarihu> Does anyone lampshade Gordon carrying a gnome around everywhere at any point?
<Chocobunny> Kammerjunk: Thanks for telling me. I need this energy drink because I somehow turned my sleeping schedule upside down (Discord was here).

<Kandarihu> Maybe I should ask Shizuka about this
<Sundaysmile> Mr Chompski fell out the vehicle when you first entered that town.
<Everlasting_Joy> Vroom vroom!
<Sundaysmile> ah I guess he didn't :P
<Chocobunny> Chompski, I was so worried!
<Chocobunny> Oh, thank the heavens.
<GarrettBrony> Lets have a moment of silence for mr Chompski
<d3rb> chompski you are so drunk, stop jumping out of the car
<GarrettBrony> how did he get that name anyway?
<Litwick> Oh god. Someone did a parody song of Smile Smile Smile with the Pyro.

<Chocobunny> GarrettBrony: Left for Dead 2 reference.
<GarrettBrony> oh
<d3rb> whats the video title
<Sundaysmile> complete the Dog race with chompski in the car
<Litwick> *points to stream* Thats why.
<GarrettBrony> Litwick then just tell me what to search
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Hrafn> my ears demand to absorb this, I must look for it now
<DrGanjalf> Litwick: Have you seen "This Day Aria" with Spy?
<Litwick> Its called Fire Fire Fire Music Video.
<DrGanjalf> ^dis gon be gud
<Chocobunny> Nothing new.
<Litwick> Someone made some dudes lyrics into a music video.
<Chocobunny> :P
<GarrettBrony> Litwick I hound it
<DrGanjalf> BTW: http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/183/9/5/pinkievision_by_subjectnumber2394-d55oeej.png
<Litwick> Was it made by someone called "joshscorcher"?
<Hrafn> Pyro is best pony :U
<Jim> Did Pinkie steal those rainbows from Cloudsdale again?
<Chocobunny> GarrettBrony: http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/106/4/5/Gnome_Chompski_by_AshWolves5.jpg
<Hrafn> oh god, that made me laugh :P
<Litwick> So, was it uploaded by a dude named "joshscorcher"?
<Litwick> If so, thats the one.
<Chocobunny> Look, it's Jane!
<DrGanjalf> eww
<DrGanjalf> D:
<Litwick> Also, the one singing in the video is not the channel owner. The channel owner himself is not a brony, at least I dont think he is.
<Everlasting_Joy> Sorry to cut this short folks. I need to take off.
<Litwick> Hes in the Marines at this time, and he got to go to bronycon. Marines and Bronycon of course mean... Semper Filly.
<Jim> Semper Filly, that's genious
<Litwick> Bronies are semper filly.

<sergio_scriptor> Spitfire: 2
<Spitfire> i leik dis episode :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sparat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve gives extra content away for free. Other major companies want you to pay for it, and even will cut content out of the main game and sell it back.
<Whiskra> its episode 4
<Kandarihu> Spitfire, I think it's episode 2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: hmm
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/561357_426319670742629_369147211_n.jpg
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow Alyx
<Whiskra> HELLO bioware
<Sundaysmile> lol
<HerpDerp> STOOPID GURL!
<sub06905|BF3> ded
<Sundaysmile> BITCH MOVE!!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> There needs to be a mod where you can Bitch Slap Alyx
<Sundaysmile> she moves!
<sergio_scriptor> RAWRity: too much dawwwwww
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Paying for extra content is fine. Cutting crap out to resell is BS.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Welcome to corporate greed...
<ducky> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I wonder what Interplay would had done
<sergio_scriptor> Nittany_Discord: that is why valve is the king of video game companies
<Spitfire> Wrek: you should use the gravity gun to throw the needles that it shoots, back at the hunter :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's why EA is the devil.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Spitfire: that doesnt work
<Kandarihu> Well, let the companies that sacrifice customer loyalty for a few extra bucks get their just deserts.
<Spitfire> Dark92Enigma: it does actually
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: EA stands for Evil Assholes
<Flyboy> we still on half life 2?
<GilDash> No one company should be lauded abot the others, for fear of watching it become as corrupt as the others...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Flyboy: Half Life 2 Episode 2
<Whiskra> thers an achivement for killing hutners with their own ammunition
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He skipped Ep 1?
<Litwick> The only thing EA has going for it is that its one of the few gaming companies to acknowledge they support homosexuality.
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/559197_497901763557098_1400772682_n.jpg
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: No he played it
<Spitfire> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it does actually :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Missed it then.
<Spitfire> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i've done it lots of times :3
<Flyboy> my god, will someone please stream toribash!
<HerpDerp> RAWRity: Aww
<Kandarihu> Litwick, that's a subjective plus. Screw EA
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: also missed Phase's play
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> to EA Screw is a compliment
<sergio_scriptor> i love valve for this: "They said if there was going to be a "half-life:the movie" they would do them theirselves using the source engine :)
<Dark92Enigma> Spitfire i've noticed everytime Darkts3|Drawing|MLG is here, everypony mixes him up with me :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dark92Enigma: ppl are too lazy to type my name
<DrGanjalf> Every game company has some flaws: Acti with their DLC's, Ubi with their DRM's, Steam can be annoying too
<Spitfire> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: what you do is, you grab an object, use it as a shield for the needles, then throw the object back at it :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam ignores exchange rates.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$1 = 1 euro.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<Spitfire> which should instakill teh hunter \:3/
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Even worse when it's £'s. =_=
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think they do that with English pounds.
<prince-dari> If $1 = £1
<ashka> hi everypony :D
<prince-dari> Oh, good.
<sergio_scriptor> hi ashka
<ducky> lol me gusta for uero
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> So anyone getting Arma 2?
<Hrafn> ignoring exchange rates is pretty idiotic :P
<prince-dari> That'd be screwed up
<ducky> euro
<Hrafn> hi ashka
<GilDash> prince-dari: It happens everywhere else? Why not expect it there too? =_=
<sergio_scriptor> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: only if it is too play Dayz
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<alexxm> hey ashkra how've you been
<Kammerjunk> I wish they'd just stick to one currency.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's something Activision would do.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, it's not hard to google a converter.
<ducky> fail
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: open the door lol
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: They *all* try it. Not just games either, *everything*.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$1 = 1 everything else that's worth more than a dollar.
<DrGanjalf> The problem with EA is, that they seem to consolidate all those things that are pain in gamer's ass
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol just drive
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01DrGanjalf: Yeah, and they think it's a good thing.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm dat driving
<Kammerjunk> At least it's not $1 = 1 JPY.
<Hrafn> I'm kinda looking forward to seeing how the Ouya will turn out
<DrGanjalf> BTW: I wonder if Riccitiello will lose his job.
<SpeedBlah> Wrek is a terrible driver
<SpeedBlah> Even mein NFS can drive better
<SpeedBlah> *Me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Is Luna Lulu?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of being better than the crap publishers, they copy the BS.
<Kammerjunk> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yes.
<sergio_scriptor> SpeedBlah: got german on the mind ? :)
<alexxm> i would not get in wreks car even if there was time to explain
<ducky> hello we are ea here is a game for 50$ but its not ready yet you need to pay us 150$ for the full one
<SpeedBlah> Nein,just mistake
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA are also hypocrites. I forgot about that.
<Wrek> 05ok guise
<Wrek> 05this is the end for now
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: They see what they can get away with and use that. For a company, it's a smart move. For us, it sucks.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Aww
<Wrek> 05gotta make dinner and all ^^
<DrGanjalf> aww
<Wrek> 05hope ya liked it so far :D
<sergio_scriptor> Wrek: well thanks for streaming :)
<ducky> yay
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> is it because Alyx is a bitch?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks Wrek.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> thanks for Streaming Wrek
<prince-dari> Meh, I don't have a problem with them.
<GilDash> Wrek: Thank you. :)
<Hrafn> thanks for the stream, it's been fun :)
<Flyboy> you there Phase4?
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Wrek
<Kandarihu> So, are you going to go back to the last save you made before losing the gnome?
<ducky> i like it bye Wrek
<prince-dari> If people still buy what they make, then what they're doing can't be that bad.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase is probably Sleeping
<GilDash> prince-dari: And *that's* why they get away with it. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: Gaming companies can get away with a lot sadly.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bad consumer base.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Regulation. Nothing will come of it until there's more of it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll take anything for the next CoD or ME.
<prince-dari> You can't blame the company for consumers putting up with bullshit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-LE0ycgkBQ
<SpeedBlah> Gonna download DiRT
<SpeedBlah> Showdown
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> time to repost
<Hrafn> well, at least indie games have been getting better and more common, at least in my experience
<SpeedBlah> Maybe Ken Block gonna ride in Estonia
<Flyboy> next time someone does a stream, please make it be of Toribash
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I mean look at it: The banking crisis happened primarily from lack of regulation. Same sort of deal.
<prince-dari> The company just wants to make as much money as possible, of course it's going to try stuff like this.
<Kandarihu> GilDash, the only regulations that the game companies will get is regulating the amount of violence in the games.
<SpeedBlah> Happiest day ever
<SpeedBlah> Ken Block in Estonia
<prince-dari> It's the consumers job to show them what they can and can't get away with.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Best G-mod video on the net.
<prince-dari> consumers'*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: well, its one of the best
<SpeedBlah> On his Ford Fiesta
<alexxm> so if people stopped buying each years cod they'd actually be inoventive with the next one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01prince-dari: In general, gamers are doing a poor job. Game addictions are allowing game publishers and developers to do crazy things for money and IP control.
<GilDash> alexxm: It won't happen though...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And intelligent consumers like me get punished.
<Kandarihu> A die-hard fan will let their favorite publisher get away with anything and everything. If there are enough die-hard fans, then the publisher has it made in the shade.
<ducky> Valve: here a free DlC guys EA:monnnnnneeeeeyyyy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Will a Mod ever stream Halo?
<prince-dari> Then rally consumers against the companies instead of just whining about company practices then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If they're able.
<Kammerjunk> I hope this isn't about Mass Effect 3 again.
<GilDash> prince-dari: Nothing comes of it.
<prince-dari> Well if no one does anything, don't expect anything to change
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Consumers are too complacent to rally.
<Litwick> BRB guys raging about how fucknig stupid Harper is.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, that's slowly changing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I don't expect consumer resentment for bad games to stay for long.
<GilDash> There'll be a revolution. There has to be, otherwise there'll be nothing in the game at all anymore. :D

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sergio_scriptor: silly, its a mod
<sergio_scriptor> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i know ,that is why i want it to be a stand-alone :3
<Chocobunny> Darkts3: "to be F2P and BE A STAND-ALONE GAME".
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> then we would have to pay for it
<ducky> wy no stream
<sergio_scriptor> ducky: cause no one is streaming :P
<Chocobunny> Captain Obvious strikes again.
<sergio_scriptor> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: not if it is F2P :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> because mods are either eating, planning Rituals, or sleeping
<ducky> sergio_scriptor : logic
<alexxm> they'll probably be a stream soon
<Chocobunny> What movie will they stream?
<ducky> i dont know
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wargames and Young Frankenstein

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> on steam they said that DayZ requires these Arma 2 games O_O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its pretty big

<Hrafn> my favourite is the one with the buffering
<Toranaga> Your wrong. The buffer women is going to pwn him
<sergio_scriptor> "the buffer show" starring hal's brother the white circle of buffer,only on bronystate
<Unnr> It was so sad when joss whedon killed the spinning circle. Why Joss, whyyyyyyy?
<Rex_Mundi> Everday im buffering
<sub06905> who knew buffer had a evil twin :o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dat Buffer is cheating on Loading Bar
<Brony4Eva> This video deserves a 9/10!
<Brony4Eva> "The Buffer Show!"
<sub06905> Buffer/10
<Hrafn> 8/10, I've seen better

<JESmith71> You watch that Buffer circle for too long, you'll get hypnotized by it
<Unnr> Tonight on all my buffers.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh Chief Manboob.
<Unnr> CALCULON: ...........

<sub06905> well while we wait for movie night imma watch some Futurama
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01New priest and all.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: Chief Manboob? O_O
<Ponies47> sub06905: Futurama is awesome o_o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yeah. From Road to El Dorado.
<JESmith71> You had to be here Darkts
<Unnr> If you look into the circle, you can see Fluffy. Alas fluffy, he died too young.
<sub06905|Futurama> ...
<Doobinz> Wheres my steam
<JESmith71> We were watching El Dorado last week and people called the fat chief Chief Manboob
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doobinz: Condensed into water.
<Doobinz> Woah thats deep
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i never saw El Dorado
<sub06905|Futurama> El Dorado.... reminds me of Uncharted
<sergio_scriptor> Doobinz: indeed
<Brony4Eva> My friends are so fucking gay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I called the chief Chief Manboob and the priest Priest Roundhead.
<Doobinz> Why?
<Ponies47> Brony4Eva: Parasprites?
<Brony4Eva> They say that im gay cause im a brony
<sergio_scriptor> Doobinz: beacuse they look like that
<Unnr> if they made an uncharted movie, who else thinks that Nathan Drake should be played by Nathan Fillion?
<Doobinz> No
<Rex_Mundi> CUTE! http://www.twcenter.net/forums/customavatars/avatar48450_215.gif
<JESmith71> Doobinz because the chief was a big fat guy with manboobs
<Hrafn> I sometimes suspect that my boyfriend is gay
<sergio_scriptor> Rex_Mundi: i love seing twilight in socks :)
<Ponies47> Brony4Eva: eeyup. Parasprites. Haters gonna hate. I have to deal with 2 myself (brother and step brother) :/
<ducky> i still remember that thing from Road to El Dorado.
*sub06905|Futurama needs to get Uncharted 2
<Doobinz> No i was asking why the guy thinks his friends are gay
<ducky> i made my friends brony
<sergio_scriptor> Hrafn: :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most bronies are straight. I'm straight and love ponies.
<Ponies47> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not a creepy freak about them, though.
<Rex_Mundi> Sergio_scriptor:$
<Hrafn> yeah, I find it really silly when people call bronies gay
<Doobinz> Lol
<sergio_scriptor> im straight and i only feel atracted to twilight :)
<Ninjazz> Same. But I'm a bit obsessed with Rarity... >_>
<Doobinz> It's quite simple
<Doobinz> why they do
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: I.... Respect you
<Hrafn> in my experience, most bronies aren't, and I honestly don't see how "gay" is an insult :P
<sub06905|Futurama> Zoiberg
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Good time to pop on in on *that* comment. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The maid thing is the worst thing I do really.
<Dken2021> I'm not gay, but I don't mind hanging out with some, they're fun to be around
<ducky> some guys like spongebob and hate bronys what are they ?
<d3rb_> hypocrites?
<Doobinz> Gay doesn't matter when the mojority of teens nowadays are metrosexual
<Ponies47> Lets see. My brother is a total parasprite but yet he has never watched an episode. My step brother did and he seemes to like it. But he's a complete suck up to my brother so I think he's pretending to be a Parasprite to please my brother. -_-
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I have good timing. >_>
<MasterDerpy> tl,dr
<sergio_scriptor> Hrafn: it's old school insults,like calling a a black guy "Gigaboo" :|

<ducky> spoiler luna is celestias father

<Derpylicious> I wonder what they do for the last season finale.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Side rooms are now open
<MadSurge> d3rb_: and not with a whimper :D
<d3rb_> 7...if they can maintain momentum would be a dream
<sergio_scriptor> Brony4Eva: that is impossible,the simpsons is going on strong it will not end right now :)
<St_Gullick> well after Season 24 and a break they will propably do a 25th season anyways
<d3rb_> exactly MadSurge
<sub06905|Futurama> 11 min :)
<Meanwhile> Side rooms are now diamonds.
<Dken2021> man, and it's been like 500 episodes, I guess it's time for them to throw in the towel
<d3rb_> it should have ended 200 eps ago
<Pale_Horse> The fun fact about that autistic child spoiler... A LOT of other shows crossed over with St. Elsewhere during it's run... So technically all THOSE shows were part of the kid's dream too... as well as all the other shows that THEY crossed over with... and so on...
<Quick_Thinker> yay
<sergio_scriptor> matt groening said that the final simpsons episode would be a 2º simpsons movie :)

<Quick_Thinker> ello Twilight Sparkle fans
<d3rb_> that sounds....cool
<d3rb_> YEAHHHHHHH
<Rex_Mundi> It should end with at least 1 full length feature film in theateres! Imagine all the bronies catching the midnight showing, the media attention would be cool to. Every theatere showing the film the first day will be its own little brony convention!
<sergio_scriptor> Nittany_Discord: i meant second :$
<Dken2021> wonder if he'll put in that idea that marge hair is actually hiding bunny ears
*AttacktheAndalite can't wait for War Games
<Derpylicious> Rex_Mundi: That'd make the public wonder about mlp too.

<LochNessCheez> WW3 = Bronies vs Anti-bronies
<Kandarihu> Technically, a war between only two countries can't count as a world war

<sergio_scriptor> 9/10
<otakon> Anyone for tennis/10
<Kandarihu> Interesting how Go wasn't on the list of games. Chess is a bad game for strategists to view a real battlefield as. Good commanders view the battlefield like a Go board.
<Pale_Horse> INB$ Joshua's Program is completely erased and his hard drive incinerated.

<JESmith> Wrek, is guesing about the air date like I did earlier not allowed either?(Because I'm still trying to figure out if they said Fall or Month in the video, and if it is next month I was guessing maybe the Hub wants the ratings up by getting the new episodes out faster)

<otakon> not iRobot
<Meanwhile> Yeah IRobot was with Will Smith.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02It had a high budget, so I guess it's alright :)
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> reroll it is
<IshBestPony> reroll or I shall rustle your jimmies

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mirathrim
<BronyInstrumental> why so silent?
<otakon> really?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02His/her selection was...
<Meanwhile> How is a high budget the sign of a B movie?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dragonshy!
*otakon goes to check this out
<sergio_scriptor> dont know :P
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> Mirathrim?
<Ninjazz> Will Smith.
<Meanwhile> What kind of crack has SB been smoking.
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> Whodafuq?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6SB, I, Robot is an A movie
<Ninjazz> Silly filly crack.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no idea, since it was a newbie I think they just let it pass
<Meanwhile> Fuck that.
<BronyInstrumental> is it a rule? no talking during lottery?
<sergio_scriptor> yep
<Chocobunny> Silence..
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> inb4 Octavias_Pride wins
<BronyInstrumental> ooh ok
<kirzstryfe> 8,6we mute the main channel so the lottery results don't get lost in the chat
<Marx> Alert! The B Movie is being contested!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Second pony episode goes to...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We should re-roll B.
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> a name so notorious in the lottery it was brought up in discussion at bronycon :/
<otakon> lol
<BronyInstrumental> that explains the silence
<Ninjazz> Lol everyone is getting on SB.
<otakon> Yahooz|Hax0rz: wait really?
<IshBestPony> reroll or I shall commence further rustling of jimmies
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> amongst the bronystaters who went yeah
<Metronome> ಠ_ಠ
<otakon> My jimmies remain unrustled
<Malavolent> I hope the B movies will be I, Robot.
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> SB Ignores ALL The mods
*IshBestPony rustles otakon's jimmies
<Jim> Octavias_Pride always wins
<Ninjazz> I like both movies, I'm okay with this.
<Malavolent> I'd like to see english version.
<otakon> I think they must be discussing it
<otakon> bc NO activity in mane
<Chocobunny> This music.. it's so..happeh.
<Meanwhile> Generally you're lucky enough to be asked for a different pick if your movie doesn't fit the criteria.
<BronyInstrumental> i love just sitting with my guitar improvising a bass line for the intermission music
<BronyInstrumental> while it's playing
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah but the newbie isn't here for sure
<Meanwhile> 9 times out of 10 you'll be ignored outright.
<Scootaloo|> ಠ_ಠ (highlight)
<sergio_scriptor> lol :)
<Scootaloo|> NO THE MUFFISN
<Scootaloo|> fail -_-
<Meanwhile> I refuse to let some schmuck I've never heard of get his wrong criteria movie in.
<Malavolent> No fair, I can't do it.
<otakon> hell, knowing the mods lately he's probably been banned for saying something akin to season 3
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> well while mane is muted, MODHACKMODHACKMODHACK
<Malavolent> When I try to, they scold me for playing at 11 PM.
<Ninjazz> Whoa, man.
<otakon> Meanwhile: my B became the A choice when UP got shot down over a 31 day month
<sergio_scriptor> i realy hoped they choosed my charlie chaplin film for b-movie :)
<Meanwhile> You're a reg.
<BronyInstrumental> i do it quietly and it's only 9:21 here
<Metronome> is chat dead?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> the mods are definitely using dark haxxing magic :<
<otakon> yeah but that was only like... 2 months after I joined
<Jim> so many connections in mane chat
<Ninjazz> ^
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> oh and sb is acting weird
<Agrold> don't know, they might be discussing if they're gonna reroll on B movie
<Ninjazz> Join, leave, join, leave.
<Meanwhile> Is this really a subject for discussion between the mods?
<Meanwhile> Because I have to figure that's what's happening.
<Malavolent> But then again, I don't have a bass.
<PONY> I refreshed because I though my chat froze
<otakon> Meanwhile: must be they haven't moved since saying "Let's reroll"
<Ninjazz> They must be discussing the B pick.
<Agrold> same here
<otakon> indeed
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> OMAIGAWD GUISE ITS A
<Scootaloo|> lets watch silent hill
<Sumica> 00,10shit explode?
<Meanwhile> Why is that in need of a discussion?
<Kencolt> There seems to be some debate as to is the B movie IS a B Movie. They're probably debating that on a private channel.
<Malavolent> What are mods up to? It's way too quiet on the main channel.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hold on everyone.
<otakon> well I robot is lower
<Metronome> Same
<Meanwhile> Have any of them SEEN I Robot?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry folks, we seem to be in a pickle right now~
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think the mods are doing a dance.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, due to some issues with the B Movie selection, we're going to reroll it.
<PONY> I wouldn't mind mind double A movie night
<Agrold> oh, they're alive again ;)
<Chocobunny> Anyone know where to get good looking figurines (unlike the Hasbro-freaky ones)?
<Ninjazz> I have, it's an A.
<Meanwhile> Finally.
<otakon> okay apparently it was chat derpage
<Meanwhile> Damn.
<Jim> they're rerolling
<Malavolent> Aww, no.
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> THERE WE GO XD
<BronyInstrumental> there's the silence break
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> Silly SB
<SuperBrony64> 11,02B Movie goes to...
<SuperBrony64> 11,0218!
<otakon> PLEASE BE BIRDEMIC!
<IshBestPony> and on that day, Meanwhile did not get his jimmies rustled, he got lucky
*Ninjazz throws cookies at SuperBrony64
<otakon> PLEASE BE BIRDEMIC!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A suggestion to everyone: Check your movies on IMDB before putting them in the lottery.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And our definitions of A and B.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LordDerpington!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It'll speed this along.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT!
<IshBestPony> otakon you only want cause of Jontron
<otakon> LordDerpington
<otakon> IshBestPony: yes :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Twelve Tasks of Asterix
<Ninjazz> It's always repeats. :S
<otakon> woah
<otakon> is that animated?
<Meanwhile> The Twelve Tasks of Asterix.
<Jim> The Twelve Tasks of Asterix
<Chocobunny> OH MY GOD, ASTERIX AND OBELIX MOVIE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow...how appropriate to be selected on Bastille Day XD
<BronyInstrumental> and now more silence?
<otakon> also, is that even IN english or subbed?
<Meanwhile> I'm...not sure.
<sergio_scriptor> alright an asterix film...YES :)
<Jim> inb4 inb4 goddamitt
<otakon> GODDAMMIT! Lulu WHY!?!?
<IshBestPony> Bronystatix
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<Wrek> 05ah yes its that day :D
<Meanwhile> I think there was a live action Asterix at some point,.
<BronyInstrumental> i've never heard of them. they any good?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should I be in my maid outfit today?
<PONY> the boring one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Meanwhile> otakon: Because you talk too fast.
<otakon> TO IMDB!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> A Movie....
*IshBestPony IshBestPonix
<PONY> (I had that on VHS when I was a kid)
<Kencolt> Not as good as the actual comics, in my opinion.
<sergio_scriptor> they are the best type of european historical comedy of all time :)
<IshBestPonix> ix
<Chocobunny> There is another one?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It has a 7.5/10...which looks to be an A Movie as well
<PONY> it's the old boring one
<Chocobunny> I remember having one on VHS.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What tasks do you give a * ?
<Meanwhile> Oh goddamnit now we're looking at rerolling the B as well.
<Ninjazz> >_(\
<Kencolt> The comics yes. The movie... well, it's definitely a B. Some things work best on paper.
<sergio_scriptor> i loved all of the asterix films,my favorite as the olimpic games one :)
<Chocobunny> The only part from the one I watched I remember is Asterix throwing a huge rock onto some romans.
<Chocobunny> That's all.
<PONY> the other Asterix movies are pretty cool
<Chocobunny> <-<
<otakon> really why?
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 I cant find it
<otakon> it's B material!
<Meanwhile> Rating apparently.
<IshBestPonix> perhaps Meanwhile will get his jimmies rustled after all
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> MORE REROLLS?
<Jim> damn, there really should be some straight definitions on what is an A or B movie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Based off of the rating, I'm going to reroll, it looks like an A Movie to me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've never heard of the movie.
<otakon> wait a B CAN'T be good now?
<sergio_scriptor> Kencolt: well it's still some funny moments in the movies,but yes i also love the books :)
<Jim> I think Asterix would classify as a B
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> 14/7/11: NEVER FORGET :p
<Meanwhile> There needs to be a definite limit.
<otakon> it can be god goddammit!
<SuperBrony64> 11,027.5/10, same as the A Movie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Was the budget high?
<otakon> good
<Ninjazz> Might need to re-def B and A movies now. :S
<Chocobunny> Rerolling again?!
<Meanwhile> No "between the range of yaddayada with a budget of flimflam"
<otakon> that's stupid! it's a B
<Chocobunny> For flipping .
<EspyLacopa> A and B movies have no clear definition.
<Meanwhile> We need bars for this stuff.
<Yume> (\(9_6)/) I just don't know what went wrong!
<EspyLacopa> Kinda like trying to define Art.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the amount of rerolls in this channel are too goddam high?
<otakon> it's animation, it's limited release, it's FOREIGN
<otakon> it's a B
<Agrold> hm.. don't think the ratings matter.. isn't the difference between A and B movies the budget?
<BronyInstrumental> oh for f*ck's sake another re-roll
<PONY> re-roll
<Meanwhile> That's racist yo.
<sergio_scriptor> XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Next reroll is...
<BronyInstrumental> more bass making time for meee!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02128
<Yume> Budget and production
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> omg i want my pick
<PONY> come, you rerolled I robot for same reason
<Kencolt> I prefer the original comics. Perhaps my favorite is the one where the Normans (Vikings) go to Gaul to learn the meaning of fear-- because they heard fear lends you wings, and if they could fly they would easily rule the known world.
<sergio_scriptor> but im sad now,cause i wanted to see asterix :'(
<Ninjazz> Sounds about right, actually.
<otakon> goddammit when did a 7.5 become HIGH?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol i picked Clerks 2 for B
<Meanwhile> Idek.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon, just because it was made be negromancers doesnt mean its a bad movie.
<Jim> Jimmies have been rustled tonight
<RX-78-SweetieBot> by*
<otakon> indeed Jim indeed
<EspyLacopa> Sooooo
*IshBestPonix rustles Meanwhile's jimmies
<Sumica> 00,10must be to make up for not having to reroll at all last week.
<EspyLacopa> How exactly are we defining A and B movies, so that these mistakes stop happening?
<otakon> EspyLacopa: we've gotten lengthy discussion on the B movie.
<Meanwhile> Oh mai gaaaaaaawd.
<PONY> I took Leningrad cowboys meet Moses/ or go to america
<sergio_scriptor> Kencolt: my favorite asterix book is "the oddisey" wehre asterix and obelix cross the world in hope of finding oil for panoramix potion :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Not going to say who it is until I get the movie checked out...
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> rerolls are fun imo
<otakon> EspyLacopa: was by budget, rating and gross along with film quality before
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> people get more chances
<Meanwhile> Really, after tonight there needs to be a much clearer set up for this stuff.
<BronyInstrumental> i guess so
<otakon> but it's fluctuated
<Ninjazz> Either need smarter voters or better comparisons. >_>
<BronyInstrumental> it adds to the tension a little
<otakon> it's me
<PONY> Reroll EVERYONE
<Meanwhile> Maybe we can take some of the best A's and the best B's we've had and create an average.
<otakon> ITS ME!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> yeah
<EspyLacopa> Fluctuation means the definition isn't really very good.
<otakon> I can FEEL IT!
<otakon> it's BIRDEMIC!
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it isn't.
<RustlerOfJimmies> http://i.qkme.me/3oo2xp.jpg
<Meanwhile> Inb4 goddamnit.
<BronyInstrumental> meanwhile i'm here rocking out a mad bass line for the intermission music XD
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> I feel that A and B movies should be picked Solely on budget
<Jim> Then, a sudden silence, as if millions of jimmies were rustled at once.
<otakon> LOL!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<RustlerOfJimmies> I feel a disturbance in the jimmies
<otakon> Yahooz|Hax0rz: no then we'll get FF: The Spirits Within again.
<Yume> I think people take it as the first and second movie not to define what quality they are
<otakon> honestly, Rotten Tomatoes
<PONY> ^
<Kencolt> Thing is, a movie with a B budget can easily have a high spproval rating. Especially in certain SF flix.
<Meanwhile> It's a bad sign when not even the mods can apparently agree on the criteria.
<otakon> >50% B, <50% A
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i think main factor for B movie is budget
<EspyLacopa> Why would A movies have low ratings?
<PONY> I pick the better one of my selection for A and worse for B... Usually they should stand for the quality requirements
<Meanwhile> otakonfoals can't arrowforce.
<Marx> Hmm, we might get a Triple Intermission.
<otakon> or hell, 70% or lower is a B, 71% or higher is a A
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<Kencolt> And the Asterix movie did have a high budget for an Euuropean animated film.
<Ninjazz> I'd like to think A movies are just newer movies.
<Jim> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT, welcome to the rustle party
<Ninjazz> heyo, TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<Meanwhile> Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT. Welcome to the fudgefest that is this weeks lottery.
<sergio_scriptor> twi_sprinkle_GS17: so,if i choosed a charlie chaplin film for b-movie it would not be picked ? :|
<otakon> hiya TheGreatAndPowerfulT you missed the great rustling of jimmies of 2012
<PONY> But yeah... For example, all the Monthy Python films should be considered A.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's all go to the panda-store, and get ourselves a snack.
<otakon> it's Birdemic I can feel it
<PONY> Curse the official ratings
<Yume> Well many people have different opinons on what a B movie is but I see it as a poorly produced low budget movie
<RustlerOfJimmies> TheGreatAndPowerfulT Hi, you're just in time to have your jimmies rus...Dammit otakon
<Kencolt> If they pick mine, it wins. Toho studios didn't really HAVE a budget at the time.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> sergio_scriptor: idk that movie
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> sergio_scriptor: i mean idk the budgets
<otakon> pandastore for a snack?
<Ninjazz> panda-store. during +m. :D
<otakon> How_long_does_it_tak: good question
<PONY> that's why it's a lottery.
<sergio_scriptor> twi_sprinkle_GS17: i mean it's old,it's from the 20's so it could get picked
<BronyInstrumental> imma get a sammich and a cuppa brb
<otakon> brb
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> sergio_scriptor: yeah it should get picked
<PONY> I wonder what 128 is
<RustlerOfJimmies> I will go to subway and when I get back they will still be trying to decide on this
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.mypandastore.com/
<Ninjazz> Intermission cycled twice.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The best damn movie ever.
<PONY> they should tell us, so they could learn from his possible mistake
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> so was wargames good?
<PONY> we*
<sergio_scriptor> twi_sprinkle_GS17: yep, :)
<Litwick> HOLY CRAP. HOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON FOR.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: wat is it?
<Kencolt> Depends on the Chaplin flick. Some are more A than B. The Great Dictator, for example-- cannot call that a B. Brilliant film AND at the time a very very high budget.
<RustlerOfJimmies> get on with it!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo they are sorting the entries from the last time ?
<PONY> Pokemon?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pokemon first movie?
<PONY> Godfather?
<Litwick> This be shenanigans.
<Jim> B movie was rerolled
<Jim> Twice
<to_sort_the> They can't decide on the criteria for a B movie.
<sergio_scriptor> Kencolt: i choose "the gold rush" is that a b-movie ? :|
<to_sort_the> Again.
<Ninjazz> I think they're discussing A/B critirias now.
<RustlerOfJimmies> yeah get on with it!
<Ninjazz> Not discussing re-rolling.
<PONY> Just make up a vote.
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> Seriously
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i think charlie chaplin is a B movie
*RustlerOfJimmies discusses rerolling
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> standardize it off Budget only
<Kencolt> Heh. I think it might qualify. IT's malso a classic, but not as powerful as The Great Dictator.
<Brony4Eva> Come on
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> since its old and budget probablyh wasnt too high
<PONY> It's mod hax night anyway
<Jim> 14.07.2012, never forget the day of rustling
<Ninjazz> How bout age?
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> Auguirre was 8.something and still B
<Yahooz|Hax0rz> but low budget
<RustlerOfJimmies> the great rustling
<Yume> Take 5 good B movies and just let us vote
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> if shaun of the dead is a B movie, i mpretty sure so is chaplin
<EspyLacopa> lol, meanwhile got kicked.
<Meanwhile> If only sumi was in here so I could correct him.
<Ninjazz> lol dat kick.
<Kencolt> By that logic, all SIlentFilms are B movies. Which doesn't really work out.
<PONY> ^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Age should have nothing to do with wether it is A or B
<Meanwhile> Guess I'll settle for my Gondor post.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> that'd be stupod
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> stupid*
<PONY> system is broken anyway
<RustlerOfJimmies> Meanwhile's jimmies are extra rustled
<Scootaloo|> How about silent hill
<Meanwhile> Extra bored more like.
<Marx> This may be the longest intermission I've witnessed.
<Meanwhile> Why does this have to happen /during/ the lottery?
<sergio_scriptor> Marx: indeed
<RaveBrony> Aaahhh!!!!
<PONY> Pirates, not the caribbean one... The Porn movie
<Brony4Eva> Come on
<RaveBrony> Letting out my anger in here!! :D
<Brony4Eva> MUFFIN!!!!!
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> idk SilentFilms
<Agrold> Pirates 2 is better :)
<PONY> ^
<Ninjazz> When it comes up, it comes up.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i mean that budget is the main factor imo
<RustlerOfJimmies> http://i.qkme.me/3oo2xp.jpg
<PONY> that's A class porn
<Jim> Where was Gondor when rerolls?
<EspyLacopa> I find it interesting that the original B choice, "iRobot" has become "I, Robot"
<Agrold> haha
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, for the B Movie...
<Brony4Eva> They are gone
<EspyLacopa> Makes me wonder if the chooser was thinking of a different movie.
<Brony4Eva> Nope i guess not
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> at this point, you know people are trolling
<Cypresswolf> O_o there's a what of pirates? too higly rated for this stream anyway, PONY
<Sumica> 00,10You all do remember that nick changeing during +m is not primited right?
<Meanwhile> It isn't?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We're going with the previous roll, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix
<Meanwhile> I didn't know that.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> im amazed that the same eps are always chosen for ponies :|
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> >.> 7.5/10 is now a B movie
<RustlerOfJimmies> Jimmies unrustled
<Ninjazz> inb4 new rule.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We could ban nick changes here with a channel mode.
<Jim> going with the previous roll
<Brony4Eva> Ok
<DewlShock> woooooo, asterix
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, so the second pony episode goes to 128, which is...
<Ninjazz> Okay, serriously. >_>
<Meanwhile> Good grief.
<Meanwhile> All that just to say "Yeah ok Asterix then"
<sergio_scriptor> alright asterix :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02RainBowJack
<Sabershy> Um, sir? This is just a really nice time just relax, for awhile.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hurricane Fluttershy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Awesome!
<Ninjazz> Ooo RainBowJack.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That was my pick.
<Sabershy> I mean, you don't have to, of course.

<Shizuka> 13yay another hour long intermission day
<otakon> wait what happened?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, so that's the lottery everypony :)

<Jim> They say nickchanges during +m is not allowed
<DIZZYRATCHET> ikr

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so how many yelled hax ?
<sergio_scriptor> do you guys think that "singin in the rain" qualifies as a A-movie ?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Yahooz: it cycled thrice
<otakon> and then the jimmies were reduced by one
<Ninjazz> That was an interesting +m...
<Pale_Horse> That's the first time I've actually seen a choice that was considered "too good" to qualify for the B movie slot. 6_9
<Invi> indeed Ninjazz
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: me for one, another mod won A pick
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> also it seems as if mods have a 8/10 chance of winning
<Yahooz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Im mean seriously
<Litwick> Did we set a new record for longest lottery music?
<MasterDerpy> hi everypony!
<Kencolt> YES. DEFINITELY.

<Agrold> Combustiblelemons think so
<Combustiblelemons> ah thanks

<Combustiblelemons> onto the b movie now correct?
<Agrold> since everything went all silent in there:P
<Ninjazz> Hmmm. That remind me... gotta go check if I even did get the newsletter.

<RX-78-SweetieBot> o_O
<Meanwhile> Besides, doesn't the survey site run on IP?
<CrimsonPhoenix> The concept might have been interesting but the execution was really poor in putting your hoof down
<Yahooz> dari really needs to make a New lemon tree thing
<Dark92Enigma> good night sergio_scriptor
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> dat bs post
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: IP
<Chocobunny> When is the next pony epi?
<Yahooz> *email
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: I was there for that, wasn't /that/ bad because we weren't debating the criteria instead of the movie.
<Yahooz> ffaaaaaaaaaaaailure
<Brony4Eva> are we watching the B movie now?
<Combustiblelemons> despicable me? i heard it's good
<fapplebloom> CrimsonPhoenix:ponyville does seem to be populated largely by fucktards
<Agrold> after this movie
<Yahooz> on my part
<BronyInstrumental> i can't say i'm talented in any arts apart from maybe music. i might as well try in the art contest, what have i to lose? XD
<otakon> yay!
<Ninjazz> Who'd go that far, though?
<CrimsonPhoenix> fapplebloom, only in putting your hoof down
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPheonix i expected more of a climax in Put your hoof down, actually
<Combustiblelemons> man i remember the last time this played in bronystate.
<otakon> Ninjazz: you'd be surprised
<Meanwhile> The incredibly butthurt?
<Unnr> Desipicable Me stars the Kerbals.. I mean minions
<fapplebloom> and how exactly is this a "B" movie?
<Yahooz> aka eman
<danieleys1995> yes young frankestien

<Kandarihu> DRAMATIC CASTLE
<Ninjazz> lol
<MadSurge> YES :$
<Agrold> dun dun dun!
<Vordox> Despicable Me - Review by Vordox. IT IS GOOD for being mostly obscur, even with it high rating and values of reviews, it gives a good sweet memory feeling of it. WORTH it for a A movie
<Shamroc> fapplebloom...low budget and stuff
<LochNessCheez> is this the hilarious one?
<otakon> fapplebloom: plus Mel Brooks
<Dark92Enigma> LEAVE US ALONE MEL BROOKS

<rem-dog> Yes. This.
<Chocobunny> James is such a Dick.
<nonody2> Darn it why do i always say horrow instead of horror
