<Deadlypon3> "No. I will not give you the mainframe just because I hate you"
<Tassadork> it's far from the worst science ever featured in a movie though. I give this movie points
<Vordox> pikorar: Desaturation still happens
<cratorkid> well, nothing here, *jumps off earth on jet pack
<Meanwhile> Whap.

<TrixieMuffin> whats the purpose of that kid in adisaster movie ?
<Vordox> RainbowAsh: nada
<pikorar> Vordox: I doubt dumping some fresh water into the ocean could cause the climate to go so crazy. It would have to be a chronic, slow change.
<Kotano> oh fuck you Emmerich
<Quick_Thinker> sure why not name lets have a fancy little party *puts on fancy monocle and top hat*

<RainbowAsh> Deadlypon3, ah, I see, they didn't have enough characters in the movie yet.
<pikorar> Vordox: Nope.
*Snow starts charging up her magic
<CK|Catnap> Enjoy these shots of the kid, folks, that kid will play an absolutely CRITICAL role in the plot later on by doing nothing, saying nothing of importance, and staying in the same place the entire movie.
<name> nightmare is eating the muffins
<Vordox> pikorar: If you looked at it earlier, it was quite a split :P
<Deadlypon3> Rainbowash a movies quality is linked to the amount of characters SHOVED into it
<CK|Catnap> And you explain this....how?
<PONY> <--P.O.N.Y
<Quick_Thinker> so snows plan to live is go to Equestria and me and names plan is to go to the moon by means of banishment
*Snow shoots a black ball of magic to the center of the planet
<JT> So unless your a weathermen nobody knows what everything means :P
<pikorar> Vordox: Density might help with preventing that.
<cratorkid> f.o.n.y
<Snow> now its just five minutes untill the planet blows

<Deadlypon3> "YOU LOST YOUR MIND!!!"
<StinkomanFan> CEREAL VELOCITY WILL SEND THOSE PONIES TO SPACE FOR ONE DOLLAR
<Vordox> pikorar: Maybe, remember the split earlier in the movie where you saw where the shelf cracked?
<name> iff we run out of food to equestria
<name> if*
<Falon> they never listen
<Axel_Dash> pikorar: you missed my love :P
<Vordox> pikorar: That size alone is quite abig of compressed Sweet Water
<RAWRity> yes, because a person would be greedy enough to let entire states be whiped out. Definitely.
<name> ...
<Deadlypon3> ...That's not a real mammoth
<pikorar> Vordox: I didn't catch the beginning of the movie.
<pony_9996> Foreshadowing?
<CK|Catnap> Because freezing works like that
<Deadlypon3> So you can read the tag at the bottom, big deal
<Vordox> pikorar: Oh, it's STILL a stretch though
<Vordox> pikorar: BUt that's what the movie is telling :P
<StinkomanFan> ...Do you think Mann Co, Black Mesa, and Apeture Science could be part of the same conglomerate?
<oni_link> Deadlypon3: IKR
<Snow> sinse when did i start falling ?
<JT> so phone's still work? XD

<Deadlypon3> W-Wait, so how does no wind or clouds actually make it COLDEr!?
<Quick_Thinker> how is this happening some who knows sciene expain it?
<pikorar> Hi Axel_Dash! How are you doing today!? I love you.
<CK|Catnap> Gasoline has a different freezing point than water, Mr. Movie Director.
<silverturtle82> stay in the copter!
<Kandarihu> Considering that Black Mesa kept beating Aperture Science out for D.O.D. funds, Aperture would either be acquired by Black Mesa or go out of business.
<RAWRity> horse. shit.
<Ryunosuke> they ded
<Meanwhile> Come on you bastard!
<Vordox> Deadlypon3: this is a stretch of imagination :P
<Axel_Dash> wow
<RAWRity> CK|Catnap: it also doesn't freeze instantaneously
<Meanwhile> Actual British reaction there.
<Ryunosuke> you know its pretty damed cold to freeze jet juel
<Axel_Dash> pikorar: im dojng fine <3
<Tassadork> no wind speed, cold air above drops right down?

<Deadlypon3> Vordox Well, it's promoting that 'THis will happen if we don't do something' and if it can't be possible WHY SHOULD I CARE?!
<JT> instant freeze...
<DerpyMuffins> Ok jet fuel doesnt freeze this easily
<Vordox> Deadlypon3: XD Good answer

<Snow> ME BOTTLE OF SCRUMPY!
<Kandarihu> What if someone were to instafreeze, and then instafreeze AGAIN! Is that even possible?
<Deadlypon3> Well, thank god the storm is specially made to target EVERY HUMAN THING instead of actually acting like a storm!!!!!!
<JT> phone's and the internet still works while cars get lifted of the ground?
<Rustymeat> SO this movie is kinda bad

<PONY> What the nordics are doing during the events of this movie; In Finland, people are currently warming up the saunas. In sweden, the people are starting to wear second layer of clothes. In Norway, people are making sure the fishes are canned in right type of oil. In Russia, Vodka production rate has been doubled.
<RaveBrony> What otakon said
<otakon> Deadlypon3: 2012 came out after this
<RainbowAsh> It aims for so bad it's good, but fails without being so bad it's horrible.
<StinkomanFan> ROCK YOU LIKE A HURRICANE!

<pikorar> PONY: The beach boys are fapping in their graves.
<Vordox> WHO ordered a cab!?
<Snow> WATER SMASH!
<Quick_Thinker> man this would be the surfers dream come true surfing into a city :D
<CK|Catnap> I like how we're only supposed to care about the three shown so far, and ignore the fact that thousands are dying right now.
<RaveBrony> ZUUUULLL!!!! :[
<BlazingStreak> Totally not obvious that so much water can smash glass....
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm sorry to say but Applejack can do nothing right now
<Meanwhile> Neptune wanted a bagel.
<Deadlypon3> You know, This movie would be a MILLION times better if it just focused on the New York Muesum Only!
<CK|Catnap> Because who cares about those OTHER PEOPLE, all that matters is if this guy and his girlfriend survive!
<SirGanjalf> Deadlypon3: I agree.
<Deadlypon3> More focus on the surviviors, we get to know them....
<BlazingStreak> Ohai Bilbo
<Ryunosuke> its be better it it was in focus :)
*name drinks cider
<weeping_pegasi82> neville longbottom?
<pikorar> This is what happens when Neptune drinks too much cranberry juice and gets stuck in a meeting for 4 hours.
<name> cider taste a lot like wine
<SirGanjalf> ^:D
<ending> :P
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<ending> hi
*Snow grabs coca cola
<Vordox> SPACE COLD
<CK|Catnap> How?
<Deadlypon3> "I WISH IT WERE"
<SirGanjalf> I'm a frayed knot.
<CK|Catnap> You can't just say "this shit's happening" and not explain HOW. >_>
<Deadlypon3> So far, you just bring us bad news
<thelonepony> i'm back what did i miss?
<RAWRity> CK|Catnap: to be fair, that's how most films work. the drama is supposed to be derived not from seeing nameless masses being swept up, but by the danger of our main characters who we know and supposedly care about. This film just sucks at building characters.
<MaxTheBrony> destruction i guess
<weeping_pegasi82> nothin special
<pikorar> thelonepony: You missed the end. OF THE WORLD.
<Vordox> Sweden: "Getting a bit chilly...
<weeping_pegasi82> pretty colors!
<MaxTheBrony> Vordox: xD
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<RainbowAsh> That looks like van gogh
<SirGanjalf> "It's the end of the world as we know it..."
<Deadlypon3> Rawrity It just has too many goddamn CHARACTERS who don't have anything to do
<thelonepony> pikorar i seen worst
<pikorar> Ice Age 5.
<cratorkid> Winter Is Coming
<Snow> why am i getting the feeling pinkie is behind all of this?
<PONY> INB4 NEW ICE AGE! Kids of 2020 can SUCK IT!
<weeping_pegasi82> show winter wrap up after this!
*oni_link has returned with a shrimp coctail and begins to nom
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: And therein is the fundamental flaw in disaster movies. We're not supposed to give a shit about the thousands of people dying in horrific ways, only the handful of characters they choose as "important".
<Dark_Horst> i like how this movie isnt even thinking about the rest of the world
<nerf_soldier> looks like antartica won't be hit by the storms
<RAWRity> CK|Catnap: for instance, in Wall-E we don't give a fuck about the humans and their issues. We care about getting Wall-E back to earth before he dies.
<CK|Catnap> Most of whom are no more important than the folks who died.
<Dark_Horst> it's like they aretn evenhere
<PONY> Prepare your iglus
<CK|Catnap> Bilbo, save us!
<oni_link> RAWRity: I love that movie
<name> :O BILBO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MaxTheBrony> Isnt this movie a bit like 2012 with less docuhie people?
<weeping_pegasi82> :O
<Deadlypon3> Catnap Well, No...as long as they treat it seriously and actually acknowledge the deaths instead of making wise ass remarks
<SirGanjalf> Man, can't wait for PJ's "Hobbit"
<TrixieMuffin> in the year 2525 , if man is still alive .... lol nope !
<MaxTheBrony> SirGanjalf: Me neither
<Ninjazz> Night, regs.
<pikorar> The brand new New York River.
<PONY> TrixieMuffin, there is always a handful to survive
*oni_link has not seen 2012
<Snow> <3 dat dog
<Ninjazz> Gnight, people. Don't die.
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm hungry for hot dogs now
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: Fundamental difference in thinking, though. The humans were not in danger of dying horribly from a freak storm of unexplained science-magic.
<JT> macthebrony: no 2012 also had earthquake's
<thelonepony> night Ninjazz
<BlazingStreak> Dat hobo :O
<name> gnight Ninjazz
<pikorar> I'll try Ninjazz: Good night.
<RaveBrony> Cya Ninjazz!
<red> a dog eating a hot dog
<Deadlypon3> ...Or really stupid of YOU
<oni_link> ikr Snow :3
<Meanwhile> Night Ninjazz.
<JT> cya ninjazz
<Vordox> "You owe me sex" "k, if we survive" PLOT I MADE I GENIUS AM NEXT HIT
<thelonepony> Hobo is best human
<Mozdoc> Its 2012 before all the 2012 shit started and people started latching onto that plot for a movie. Remember when 2012 came out alongside something that was essentially the same thing just a different title?
<RaveBrony> Cya, again, Ninjazz!
<Iwa> Oh, you so brave, generic teenager #67854
<pikorar> Wow, these people are so calm about the end of the world.
<RaveBrony> :D
<name> or day cant really tell in the moon
<BlazingStreak> inb4 hobo saves the world
<TrixieMuffin> its a dog eat hotdog world
<Ninjazz> Lol, Rave.
<pikorar> NO U!
<oni_link> TrixieMuffin: oh you
<PONY> Oh, yes only few mnths 'till end of the world... How many of you heard they found a new calendar rather recently?
<Deadlypon3> ...Well, glad that Subplot did jack shit
<Snow> what if
<JT> I know I missed the start of the movie but it seems like the characters are pretty sucky
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: In disaster movies, the core argument is that we're supposed to care about their choice of characters and ignore all the other equally important (if not MORE important) families and people dying. That just doesn't fly for me, no matter how well you develop those characters.
<weeping_pegasi82> how would he know that
<RAWRity> "damn cellphones" yeah, not like the storm would have destroyed the fucking towers or anything.
<pikorar> A MAD HOUSE!
<Snow> this will happen tommorow but we are in a time paradox in wich we relive the same day over and over again?
<Deadlypon3> ...So telephone lines work, but electricity doesn't WORK
<SirGanjalf> My friend said that "2012" sucks even compared to "TDAT"
<oni_link> PONY: One theory of mine was that what if they didnt have time to finish the calendar? They did just dissapear all of a suden
<otakon> SirGanjalf: that I heard as well
<Vordox> Dat 4 Celsius water isn't THAT cold... Wimp
<JT> no 2012 was pretty good
<otakon> oni_link: that's what I said
<PONY> It would be interesting to see a new Ice Age before my death
<Deadlypon3> SirGanjalf Both of them are equally dumb...at least TDAT has some interesting ideas
<oni_link> otakon: Great minds think alike :)
<Ryunosuke> inb4 hypothermia
<pikorar> PONY: Don't wish for an Ice Age before your death if you know what I mean.
<otakon> Vordox: that's only 4 degrees above freezing, that's REALLY FUCKING COLD
<Deadlypon3> "Yeah, sorry I couldn't spent as much time with my son when I was SAVING THE FUCKING EARTH, YOU BIIYTCH'
<name> say hello to sid the sloth for me down there
<Vordox> otakon: You have never heard of the Swedish tradition of "Nyårsdoppet" "New Years Dip"? :D
<PONY> oni_link: http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/story/2012-05-08/maya-apocalypse-calendar-2012/54879760/1
<Deadlypon3> "Why should I care about my son living when I have the entire WORLD TO THINK ABOUT"
<RAWRity> Vordox: we have our own version of that. We call the Polar Bear's Club
<CK|Catnap> That's just the sound of me drowning, dad
<RainbowAsh> Luckily the phone company is doing well.
<SirGanjalf> Deadlypon3: Frozen New York it's pretty much the only part of this movie i like. Other stuff is "meh" at best.
<SirGanjalf> *is
<StinkomanFan> Twilight Sparkle shall save you children!
<Tassadork> yeah... once the year is over the doomsayers will just pick another number
<Deadlypon3> SirGanjalf if they focus on a city frozen over and the inhabinits trying to survive is really awesome
<Vordox> "Wait out the ice age " "k"
<JT> ofcourse tassadork
<pikorar> StinkofmanFan: But Twilight isn't allowed to use magic for Winter Wrap Up.
<flutterchu> it's going higher every second BULLSHIT
<Tassadork> oh, we miscalculated and 2012 is actually in 2014!
<ekips> not making a come joke here
<oni_link> PONY: They were just fascinated with time. So the 2012 calenar was just a coincedence :P thats cool
<RAWRity> Dad, enough wih the dramatic pauses, fucking tell me before I drown you shit stain.
<Deadlypon3> Rawrity XD
<name> ...

<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu wrong actor :p
<prince-dari> y u do dis
<CK|Catnap> Of COURSE je'
<CK|Catnap> *he's alive
<RAWRity> and then she does nothig to try and save him.
<JT> I almost did bitch U don't help me? :O
<Deadlypon3> ...What, did he drop his wallet down there!?
<JT> I saved you from drowning
<Axel_Dash> why didn't he go for him xD
<Axel_Dash> she*
<RAWRity> "I thought you drowned...so I did nothing but stare at the water."
<Kandarihu> The lines fit together like a jigsaw piece
<CK|Catnap> I can tell you why.
<otakon> hiya prince-dari hey is Galaxy Quest an A movie and how do you like Space Jam for the B movie.
<Deadlypon3> "THIS IS NOT THE SAME"
<Axel_Dash> *trollface*
<pikorar> Lucy, say it and I will beat you.
<RainbowAsh> One does not simple walk into new york
<flutterchu> *throws up on floor hapily*
<RAWRity> THIS IS NOT THE SAME :(
<Deadlypon3> ...Shouldn't you stay so you can help with evacuation efforts?
<Ryunosuke> that old guy reference
<name> nerd hug
<Snow> dat body heat
<SirGanjalf> CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME:[
<Ryunosuke> "I walked 20 miles barefoot in the snow to school you young whippersnapper"
<prince-dari> Galaxy Quest has high rating and high budget/gross
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<CK|Catnap> She didn't jump in because this movie doesn't believe that women can do anything. >_> Notice how this wife is doing nothing, the girlfriend is doing nothing, every female character (the few there are) aren't doing ANYTHING?
<prince-dari> So yeah
<Deadlypon3> N-No? Gonna go and save your son, who is probably smart enough to survive on his own
<prince-dari> It's A
<pikorar> His heart = FAIL!
<MaxTheBrony> dat akward hug
<Whiskra> baad excuse lady
<prince-dari> It looks kind of 'goofy', but it's A
<RainbowAsh> I still don't get evacuate where. Isn't the eye of the storm cold and the rest of the world f*cked up by the storms?
<flutterchu> bleh
<RAWRity> Deadlypon3: they aren't DOING evacuation efforts because apparently the vice president hates humanity.
<RaveBrony> Much better, heh
<PONY> RAWRity, didn't you know? Any character, in any film, book or game, who isn't currently "on camera", freezes and teleports where they are next needed, in this case, someone just forgot to turn of the camera.
<prince-dari> And Space Jam's alright
<Deadlypon3> Rawrity Nobody is doing anything.
<TrixieMuffin> Shes just making it worse , if the blood from his boner rushes .... you get the picture
<RAWRity> Deadlypon3: eeyup
<RaveBrony> prince-dari: Were those the movie picks? I missed the lotto
<PONY> RAWRity: who doesn't?
<Deadlypon3> Rawrity the only thing doing anything is the storm
<Deadlypon3> Dogie :O

<pikorar> I'M ON A BOAT!
<Meanwhile> oni_link: Yes. Yes it was.
<Deadlypon3> WHERE DID THE SHIP COME FROM!?
<RAWRity> That thing would have slammed into a building and stopped.
<CK|Catnap> A cruise ship would not fit into the streets of Manhattan, nice try
<flutterchu> still better shipping pony then twilight (bad pun)
<PONY> Deadlypon3, what should do with a drunken sailor?
<oni_link> Meanwhile: awesome :3
<Meanwhile> Don't you hate when you're at the library and a boat sails past?

<Kandarihu> To the people who are whining about preserving the bible, Before the Gutenburg press was invented and the Bible became mass produced, priests were the only people who had access to the scriptures and were trusted blindly to be teaching accurately. And there was nothing to keep them honest.
<RAWRity> and then they fucked in their clothes because fuck it was still cold.

<Kandarihu> Furthermore, Quick_Thinker, very few wars were caused by the Bible. If any holy book could be blamed for perpetually causing wars, it's the Quran. But the largest human-caused mass casualty events were done by people who hold no higher power besides themselves.

<SirGanjalf> "You MANIACS! You blew it up!"
<Squallken> ok thnx
<name> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITS STILL THERE
<Iwa> RainbowAsh: Indeed, seeing this movie already surpassed plenty of physics rules :)
<CK|Catnap> Pretty sure this is symbolism, but I have no idea what of.
<JT> And the second one...
<Shizuka> 13IT WAS HOTH ALL ALONG
<Squallken> i wonder
<Vordox> French Staturing modules = WORKS
<PONY> The roblem is... how were the continets so well visible, since the sea and land shuld have been frozen pretty much equally?
<Thrackerzod> hey everyone
<red> DAMN YOU NATURE
<Squallken> fight club
<spitfirecolt> you dam dirty apes
<RAWRity> Rolland Emerich is good for one thing and one thing only: Desecrating national landmarks.
<Ryunosuke> spaceballs, oh shit, there goes the planet
<DerpyMuffins> Thats europe
<Moopy> Don't you ever make fun of alaska
<Nittany_Discord> Am I the only one that liked this movie despite its problems?
<red> I liked it too
<Ryunosuke> it was okay
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Weather NERD :P
<DerpyMuffins> I kinda liked it
<Meanwhile> I gave this movie the cold shoulder when it came out.
<FaithHeart> nah, it's a good movie if you don't take it seriously
<name> i didnt like
<JT> Nah I also kinda liked it
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I enjoyed it, but mostly for tearing it apart.
<Ryunosuke> not the best, but enjoyable
<SirGanjalf> Nittany_Discord: I like the NY parts
<BlazingStreak> My first time watching it. It was meh
<PillowPoni|Phone> Nittany_Discord: nope.
<name> i somewhat loved it
<PONY> Nittany_Discord, I don't mind the problems, I just find this film bit too long.
<FlutterMEDIC> time to start diggin
<Nittany_Discord> Vordox: Part of why I like it.
<Squallken> okay, no one can say the title of the first move STILL :D
<Axel_Dash> notbad
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: I enjoyed it, but yeah
<RainbowAsh> The library just disappeared?
<RAWRity> >oh shit
<Vordox> ALL THIS RIPPING by everyone makes it more enjoyable :D
<RAWRity> >there's more than one library in NYC
<name> ...
<Thrackerzod> SHH dont tell them the clouds will freeze and fall thus there would be no storm
<Mozdoc> So they traveled forty miles in...what, twelve minutes?
<red> magic shoes
<Slender_Pony> And then they did it
<JT> Eeyup
<Ryunosuke> why take off snowshoes?
<Shizuka> 13through a window down a pile of rubble into a big hall
<Iwa> Legend of Zelda: Ice Temple
<PONY> Mozdoc, yes.
<Shizuka> 13call me crazy but for some reason it reminded me of morrowind tribunal
<Moopy> Im just saying im from alaska so please do not make fun of alaska cause thats were im from dude so yeah
<PONY> Mozdoc, not even exhausted.
<Shizuka> 13the first time you go into that ruin under mournhold
<Snow> Iwa: at least its not the water temple
<Unnr> Shizuka: Needs more assassins
<name> ...
<Mozdoc> Did they break the sound barrier or land speed record while doing so? Because that's IMPRESSIVE!
<Iwa> Snow: You...you had to remind me... Damnit :P
<name> the hoboo lives
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Dammit, i need to finish Morrowind already:D
<FlutterMEDIC> Moopy: but we will make fun of Palin
<Shizuka> 13it's the ghost of christmas present!
<kirzstryfe> you can never "finish" morrowind
<Moopy> good
<name> i have oblivion and skyrim
<red> they go in and they are all in t-shirts and shorts
<SirGanjalf> I just completed the Bloodmoon so far.
<PONY> name, can't get rid of dem Hobos
<Meanwhile> Looks more like the ghostbusters.
<PONY> wat was that sound?
<Shizuka> 13it's harrison ford!
<PillowPoni|Phone> Nah, he's the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the future
<Meanwhile> ...now what?
<Franek12354> what will happen later on?
<red> they leveled up
<Quick_Thinker> INDY ANA FREAKIN JONES
<SirGanjalf> Quest Completed
<PONY> some NPC's are noticing new layers
<Meanwhile> Now you can starve/freeze to death together.
<Shizuka> 13and jason is proud even though he has no idea who any of these people are
<cratorkid> anypony know the name of the fifth :song of ice and fire: book series

<name> WOOOOOOO THEY MADE IT
<Wirisme> time for more subtle messages
<SirGanjalf> Viva la Mexico!
<RainbowAsh> Wasn't the mexican border snow-covered as well?
<Thrackerzod> ^^
<cratorkid> mexico then became a world ssuperpower

<CK|Catnap> Even as the president he's still a dick
<name> VICTORY
<DerpyMuffins> What president is that?
<Meanwhile> Gee don't sound enthusiastic or anything.
<AJIsAwesome> Scoots just advertised Bronystate! :)
<Shizuka> 13the weather channel, your trusted source of news?
<cratorkid> RAWRity: thnx! gonna pick it up today
<Shizuka> 13SPELL OUT THE MOVIE'S MESSAGE FOR US!
<Mozdoc> Morality speech time...
<Nittany_Discord> The Weather News Channel!
<RainbowAsh> Again I feel this movie wants to tell me something. I still don't know what, though
<Quick_Thinker> PREACHY AS FUCK MOVIE GO
<Thrackerzod> GLOBAL WARMIN OH NOOOESS
*name lands back on earth in calgary
<DerpyMuffins> What president is this?
<name> im back evrybody
<red> the main thing i dont like is the shitty moral that they shoved into the movie
<Nal> What are we watching?
<PONY> FlGHT CLUB
<RAWRity> funny that cratorkid mentions ASoIaF. You see, the 7th book in the series is called, get this: The Winds of Winter
<CK|Catnap> I'm calling bullshit on your message, movie.
<FlutterMEDIC> name: my dad's birthplace!
<DocMeticulous> I find it funny how global warming will lead to global cooling
<Nittany_Discord> Let's burn up the rest of the fossil fuels!
<CK|Catnap> You explain that it's human's fault that nature decided to make a super storm? BULLSHIT.
<DerpyMuffins> Its Mexico. they are atleast 2nd world
<FaithHeart> it's technically called climate change
<name> FlutterMEDIC: i live in calgary
<Nittany_Discord> Also, they should have totally harvested that wind from the superstorms.
<SirGanjalf> DocMeticulous: It's funny because that's the most probablr part of the movie
<TrixieMuffin> So now they all go green and heal the world ....causeing everything to shift back just as catastrophic again ?
<Kencolt> DocMeticulous: That's actually a real scientific theory. How accurate it is, well...
<Cypresswolf> and then the governments of the world rationed all the world's resources so that disaster would never be repeated
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. How is this about consuming natural resources? This ice age was caused by splitting the North Pole in half.
<RAWRity> and cancer kid somehow lives.
<Quick_Thinker> FUCK YOU PETER WE DONT CARE FOR YOU USELESS ASS CHARACTER
<name> :O
<RainbowAsh> TrixieMuffin, that would be hilarious
<Joy> What movie is this?
<Axel_Dash> The Day After Tomorrow Joy
<Snow> but now i realy gotta go
<Snow> later
<SirGanjalf> *probable
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, and that's how they formed a brutal global governance that crushes human freedom forever.
<PONY> Theoritically, the Global warming leading to new Ice Age IS the most factual part of this movie.
<Axel_Dash> bye Snow
<name> they lice
<Crippler> Mr. Freeze gets his revenge on the world.
<DerpyMuffins> How can you even see that
<name> live*
<thelonepony> bye Snow
<JT> Cya snow ^^
<Wirisme> stream is gone
<name> bai sn
<name> snow*
<RainbowAsh> Wirisme, fine here
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Snow
<Moopy> you need to refesh buddy
<Wirisme> ok it's back again
<cratorkid> jon snow
<Wirisme> I refreshed like 10 times
<Wirisme> but It's back now
<thelonepony> hobo and the dog are best survivers
<Kencolt> They are gonna need a LOT of rock salt to clear those streets.
<Zamer> did the snow freeze the movie?
<TrixieMuffin> And Canada makes a massive landgrab
<Axel_Dash> Wirisme: no problems with me :P
<Kandarihu> PONY, theoretically is the key word.
<Joy> :)
<cratorkid> giddy snirks
<Cypresswolf> those cg buildings have no roof access O_o
<Wirisme> How strange
<cratorkid> smirks *
<red> what would have made this movie better would have been if there had been the others invading as well
<name> so we they live
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning BronyState. :)
<Meanwhile> And then in the background, the mothership from Independance Day.
<oni_link> hello AdamTheDuck
<Kandarihu> PONY, communism actually working is also a theory.
<Nittany_Discord> The space station is pretty high up.
<FlutterMEDIC> morning AdamTheDuck
<Rainbow_Glasses> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<thelonepony> hi AdamTheDuck
<Quick_Thinker> OH YEAH S CLEAR BUT MILLIONS NOT BILLIONS DIED
<FaithHeart> and florida survives
<name> so beutiful
<Moopy> hello AdamTheDuck
<Wirisme> I'm picking up some kind of environmental message from this movie
<CK|Catnap> That's right, folks, the storm magically cleaned up ALL of the pollution in the world.
<CK|Catnap> ALL OF IT
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hello AdamTheDuck
<Cypresswolf> The astronaughts were in the best spot
<name> hai AdamTheDuck
<Kandarihu> weeping_pegasi82, wake up. The movie is over
<AdamTheDuck> And I just make in time for the credits :D
<Axel_Dash> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hi guys
<DerpyMuffins> Caramel wake up
<Crippler> you know what would have made this film better? nick cage.
<Nittany_Discord> The astronauts missed all of the fun.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello SpadeMagnes[R]
<Quick_Thinker> FUCK THIS MOVIE IM PLAYING BLACK MESA
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: hi
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just playing wow right now
<Ryunosuke> you know
<red> moral of the story: kill millions of people to make the air clear
<Quick_Thinker> IM OUT
<Cypresswolf> bleh...I cant spell :P
<name> :'( so beutiful
<DerpyMuffins> Caramel you awake?
<thelonepony> hi SpadeMagnes[R] :)
<FlutterMEDIC> hi SpadeMagnes[R]
<cratorkid> bye guys :)
<Ryunosuke> with all that ice, there would be more land opened up
<RainbowAsh> 0 Kelvin/10
<FaithHeart> yay~
<RAWRity> bonjour.
<FlutterMEDIC> cya cratorkid
<alexxm> how are things SpadeMagnes[R]
<name> hi SpadeMagnes[R]
<thelonepony> bye cratorkid
<weeping_pegasi82> zzzzzzzzzz-oh I'm awake
<JT> Bye crator ^^
<name> bai cratorkid
<PillowPoni|Phone> Bye cratorkid
<SirGanjalf> red: That plan would actually succeed:D
<Axel_Dash> bye cratorkid :P
<CK|Catnap> Moral of the story: If nature creates a freak storm that wipes out existence, it was clearly the fault of those EEEEEEVIL human beings.
<Meanwhile> Wolves are listening to your plans/10
<AdamTheDuck> Bye cratorkid
<The_Browncoat> Still better than Fight Club.
<Kandarihu> red, lol
<weeping_pegasi82> I fell asleep/10
*cratorkid hugs FlutterMEDIC thelonepony name PillowPoni|Phone Axel_Dash AdamTheDuck
<AJIsAwesome> bye cratorkid

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I missed the entire movie/10
<cratorkid> hugs AJIsAwesome
*Axel_Dash hugs cratorkid
<PillowPoni|Phone> CK|Catnip: EVIL?
<Axel_Dash> ^^
<Shizuka> 13oh hey they're playing the vice president's theme now
<SirGanjalf> Let's kick some ICE/10
<thelonepony> hugs cratorkid
<FlutterMEDIC> Shizuka: I just don't know what went wrong...
<Kandarihu> FREEDOM CAUSES WORLD-ENDING CATACLYSMS/10
<JT> XD
<Ryunosuke> ehh,
<Shamroc> ohai Shizuka!
<Meanwhile> There were surprisingly few puns tonight.
<Ryunosuke> ICE/10, that is all
<name> statue of liberty/10
<Shizuka> 13AMERICA/10
<weeping_pegasi82> even the credits are boring...
<PONY> Kandarihu, if the tempature keeps raising the current rate, the ice will melt at the poles. This could cause a scenario leading to new Ice Age out of several different theoritical reasons.
<Moopy> 10/10
<SpadeMagnes[R]> the cataclysm needed more Deathwing
<Meanwhile> You turning into Scoots Shizu?
<DocMeticulous> 10/Ice! wait...
<FlutterMEDIC> did someone say puns? "Stay cool."
<PONY> Kandarihu, the keyword is several.
<Shizuka> 13did i say america
<Joy> :)
<Shizuka> 13i meant RUSSIA/10
<Mega_Milk> Knowledge is power, Power is corruption, Corruption is madness, Madness causes chaos, to prevent chaos we burned the books.
<RainbowAsh> This movie is the best argument against reducing emissions I have ever heard.
<SirGanjalf> PONY: Yeah, but no way it happens nearly as fast as in this movie
<Cypresswolf> The astronauts aboard the space station during the crisis were stranded up there for 4 years while the remnents of NASA rebuild the shuttle damaged with the extreme freeze
<Meanwhile> Vodka/10
<sub06905> Murico/10
<PONY> SirGanjalf, nope.
<Alchemist> hai, did i just miss the movie night?
<red> more like stay frosty
<FlutterMEDIC> Alchemist: nope
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<name> yup Alchemist
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: but by the time they were ready, NASA's funding was cut and the space shuttles were grounded
<DerpyMuffins> It was just a normal winter for Russia
<Ryunosuke> Cypresswolf, has a point
<thelonepony> Alchemist nope >_>
<Ryunosuke> NASA, ESA, and JSA are all.... aout of commission
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Welp back to WoW
<PONY> SirGanjalf, but changing from raising, to decreasing current will take also a long time.
<Shizuka> 13murmur murmur washing machine
<Ryunosuke> and the Russian space program only suffered a slight delay
<name> it was warmer in canada
<Nittany_Discord> Shizuka: Dammit Obama! :p
<Alchemist> i thought the movie night was from 20 pm GMT 1 till about 24 pm-1 am
<Ryunosuke> that was because they had to brew a new batch of vodka
<Cypresswolf> I think such a freeze would be the polar opposite of an EMP - nothing would work unless you make all new parts
<SirGanjalf> Woah, it's 1 am already?
<red> but florida and texas didnt freeze so the shuttles would have been fien
<name> by 10 degrees celcious
<JT> yeah why did bronystate fuck up the timing on euro movie night?
<Nittany_Discord> The Russian Space Station Mir was destroyed after Bruce Willis saved the planet from a massive asteroid.
<Cypresswolf> *EMP - Electro Magnetic Pulse
<weeping_pegasi82> *yawn*
<Joy> I need to go. :(
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Joy
<thelonepony> bye Joy
<JT> Bye Joy ^^
<name> bai Joy
<Alchemist> anyways, been to the movies, saw resident evil retribution, had a great laugh. soooo terrible :D
<FlutterMEDIC> lets get to Euro movie night dammit
<Shizuka> 13JT: we always air at this time on saturdays, it's just past shizu was sleepy and entered friday's time for saturday
<PONY> The point is, nature will always find a way to survive. No matter what we do, we are just fucking ourselves in the ass, making this planet inhabitable for future generations.
<name> i think this was euro movie night
<JT> Oh ^^
<PONY> The best action to be taken for that, dont have kids.
<DocMeticulous> I must go, my people need me *swoosh*
<Nittany_Discord> BRB. Restarting laptop.
<Axel_Dash> bye DocMeticulous ^^
<oni_link> you should rest shizu :3
<PONY> so they wouldn't need to face the shit we leave for them, and we have a better chance not to cause some serious over population issues.
<Shizuka> 13i enter countdown timers a month in advance
<name> ...
<Shizuka> 13i love people that think we're overpopulated, it's as though they've never seen a map of the world
<weeping_pegasi82> so many people worked on this movie what a shame
<RaveBrony> Hey, Phase4. Did something happen to the MvM server? Its no longer in my favorites. o:
<BlazingStreak> wait/...
<FaithHeart> well, we're at 7 billion people
<BlazingStreak> i just saw someone on the credits called thomas wanker...
<RaveBrony> If not then whats the name of it?
<FaithHeart> we can house up to 14 billion
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some places could use some culling
<Ryunosuke> its not so much overpopulation, its that the population is not evenly distributed
<Kandarihu> PONY, the only way we're screwing ourselves is by trying to force each other into unworkable constraints over a panic that somehow we're totally breaking the planet just by having a standard of living, and the world is going to end unless we all go to the stoneage.
<FaithHeart> before things get overcrowding
<Alchemist> FaithHeart: yes and the curve is getting flat, its going to stabilize in a few years
<RainbowAsh> PONY, that's about as cynical as saying that you shouldn't live too healthy so you don't have to worry about pension.
<Shizuka> 13nyx.ariscop.net or applebloom.ariscop.net or spitfire.ariscop.net
<name> well some countries are overpopulated,
<FaithHeart> that's good to hear, Alchemist
<Shizuka> 13one or more of them should be a server, but the browser can be a bit finicky with it for some reason now
<Ryunosuke> I am sure you could fit more than a few contenents in the outback and no one would have a proplem with crowding :0
<RaveBrony> Oh, ty Shizuka :)
<Ryunosuke> well
<Alchemist> name: many western countries actually have a decreasing population.
<Shizuka> 13if all three are down it's probably phase's provider being a fail again
<Ryunosuke> maybe the aborigines
<Cypresswolf> I heard somewhere 2 years ago - if you gathered up the worlds population and moved then to North America, everyone would have 1/2 an acre of land each
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys what movies next week
<Meanwhile> Well, movies are done so I might join you on one of those Rave.
<Kandarihu> Is Caramel still streaming?
<RainbowAsh> Ryunosuke, crowding is not the issue. Getting them fed is.
<name> Alchemist: in the east its getting too crowded
<Shizuka> 13you could fit every human on earth into san francisco last i heard
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, yeah, provider is being fail
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Metro 2033 is $3 right now :O
<Shizuka> 13oops
<Kandarihu> I guess he is. The ding is Caramel's ping, right?
<sub06905> wakey wakey Caramel
<Alchemist> name: japan is one the decreasing population countries
<oni_link> Shizuka: still wouldnt be comfortable :P
<Phase4> 00,02dat colour
<Ryunosuke> san fransisco itself or the bay area
<Shizuka> 13course not
<Kencolt> Shizuka: I suspect that would be standing room only, though.
<Kandarihu> I guess so.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> whaat movies won the lottery
<name> Alchemist: well most of the countries
<Shizuka> 13but we have a long LONG way to go before we're overpopulated
<RainbowAsh> SeaponiesofLiverpool, Galaxy Quest and Space Jam
<oni_link> true
<PONY> Shizuka, take a moment to study how we multiply, and what is the doubling rate.
<name> :O YEAH SPACE JAM
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Galaxy Quest A movie?
<FaithHeart> yay Space Jam
<Zamer> if we were in the episode of the Sliders then I could see us all in San Francisco
<Slender_Pony> Ponies now?
<L_Y_R_A> ಠ_ಠ
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Ponified Sliders
<Wirisme> no ponies :(
<Cypresswolf> http://flowingdata.com/2011/07/27/if-the-world-lived-in-a-single-city/
<oni_link> So Deus Ex: Human Revolution is on sale. Yay or Nay on getting it?
<DaringDerpy> good morning
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The hell is Sliders?
<DaringDerpy> nay
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> is Galaxy Quest the A movie?
<oni_link> hi DaringDerpy
<RainbowAsh> So...if Caramel is asleep, does that mean no one else can stream either?
<Kandarihu> Caramel, it's pony time!
<Ryunosuke> GW2 worth getting? :)
<name> sup DaringDerpy
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we need to stream Sliders
<Spectrum_Rush> Caramel: wake up
<L_Y_R_A> ಠ_ಠ
<DaringDerpy> it gets repetitive fast, oni_link
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_density.png yep the earth is overpopulated all right
<RainbowAsh> SeaponiesofLiverpool, there was some arguing about that, but apparently it is
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Its a good movie
<Zamer> I could do a livestream of Sliders i got the full series
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shizuka: Seems legit
<Axel_Dash> Ryunosuke: I've been told it's bullshit lol
<sub06905> as Phase4 would say Deus Ex: HR get it NOW :<
<L_Y_R_A> ಠ_ಠ
<Zamer> but thats if people are willing
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> maybe both in limbo between A and B movie
<Kandarihu> Caramel, wake up!
<RaveBrony> Ah
<Spectrum_Rush> Caramel: http://i.imgur.com/DXbud.jpg silly
<oni_link> DaringDerpy: Really? Thats a shame because the trailers made it look fun
<DaringDerpy> black horse at midnight
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Caramel stop snoring
<PONY> if we increase the population by certain percent yearly, fter a certain time the population has been doubled, please take a note also how the ercents are increasing yearly, Shizuka, watch the link I sent you, it' interesting.
<L_Y_R_A> ಠ_ಠ
<DerpyMuffins> Caramel feel asleep again
<Alchemist> feeding isnt an issue either, distribution is
<Rustymeat> PONIES
<oni_link> L_Y_R_A: dat face of dissaproval
<name> Caramel
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka, like I said, its not overpopulated, the density is not evenly distributed
<Wirisme> yaaaay :(
<Ryunosuke> then ponies
<Kandarihu> Sorry. Thanks
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<name> YAY PONIES
<Applejack2012> yay
<RainbowAsh> Shizuka, it depends on how you define overpopulate. When it is about squeezing each other to death, then no, but that definition doesn't make any practical sense.
<FaithHeart> PONIES
<DaringDerpy> oni_link: some people like it, some not so
<Franek12354> finally
<Rustymeat> WHAT
<Shamroc> hahaha
<DerpyMuffins> There you go
<BlazingStreak> LOL
<L_Y_R_A> dat pictureಠ_ಠ

<RaveBrony> I think the only special item that dropped was for Phase. I think he got that tin/robot hat O.o
<Zamer> so I assume the Wonderbolts had failed already
<SirGanjalf> Mozdoc: Because Trollestia
<JT> gaurds are just a waste of money
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This is one of the episodes that makes me dislike celestia

<Cades> grey man :/
<SirGanjalf> Mom was right...
<LightningDashFast> wat
<Shizuka> 131) you'll have to forgive the load times, they're pretty abysmal for a source game, but they cram a metric plotload of detail into these maps
<weeping_pegasi82> doctor who's on in an hour for me :D

<Cynder7> 6xD

<Dark_Horst> XAX: he's quoting freemans mind
<Shizuka> 13even doom 3 didn't convey the scale of destruction as well as this is
<XAX> Dark_Horst: Yeah. They skipped out on the bit where you get teleported to Xen and can walk around for a bit.
<Phase4> 00,02doom 3 never really looked destroyed to me
<weeping_pegasi82> I watched the doom movies does that count?
<weeping_pegasi82> *movie
<Noob709> The music is more detailing to the scenery than the old version.

<Buytoast> goddammit Godwin Foremin
<Cypresswolf> Sorryyyy :( Didnt mean to kill you
<Lonko> Did whoever plays this right now get the Bathroom achievement?
<Shizuka> 13something about that made me immediately reject the freeman's mind line
<VioletLynnScraton> I just dont know what went wrong! *elevator falls* Opps!
<Barbetos> I needed more railings.
<Nex> well they elevated quickly
<weeping_pegasi82> you ok people?
<Shizuka> 13that was easily the most realistic elevator crash i've seen in a game
<theprovencher> They are ok. >_>
<LightningDashFast> yeah
<name> poke the bodies with a stick
<Cades> i wish it was raining here :/
<Noob709> Shizuka: Even in the old game?
<PsychoticDoc> bronystate playing blackmesa source= all of my yes
<LightningDashFast> harsh
<SirGanjalf> name: *crowbar
<Fluttercry> 05,15Probably the fact that they were begging not to die, instead of a comical "ACK"
<weeping_pegasi82> the non-existant stick?
<name> i call it the red mettalic stick
<Shizuka> 13original they're just generic NPCs with generic yells
<Shizuka> 13that was... actual buildup to a crash
<Shizuka> 13so yeah
<Shizuka> 13worth 8 years right here
<Lonko> It wasn't even a closed elevator
<LightningDashFast> it makes it mor emotional for sure
<Lonko> There were so many ways to get out of there alive
<XAX> This game was...
<Barbetos> My reaction was DDDDDD=
<XAX> worth the weight
<SirGanjalf> ^
<XAX> owait It's not a valve game.
<Kandarihu> I wish we could have a hybrid stream, with Shizuka streaming the video and the audio coming from a combination of Shizuka and Allegr0.
<XAX> shit.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka does the jumping and large collision box bother you?
<Shizuka> 13the jumps suck yeah
<PsychoticDoc> i beat this this morning, was easily the most awesome looking game ive played in a while
<weeping_pegasi82> ew
<Shizuka> 13there's a few stupid hard ones you wouldn't think you can make
<Phase4> 00,02follow me doctor
<Barbetos> So I wonder how many members at valve are playing this game at the moment.
<name> wheres the crowbar
<XAX> The jumping reminds me of gmod
<Cynder7> 6I wish it'd rain more often :P
<Cades> same :P
<PsychoticDoc> XAX: well, it was made with practicly the same engine
<DerpyMuffins> Reload sometime will ya?
<Barbetos> The AI being smart too helped a lot
<DerpyMuffins> Reload much?
<weeping_pegasi82> ram it!
<MadSurge> YABBA, MY ICING
<SirGanjalf> Barbetos: I wonder how many people that made this will receive Valve's job offer soon
<Kandarihu> So the jumping is better in the official games?
<Phase4> 00,02still havent got a weapon have you
<name> wheres gman
<XAX> MadSurge: YES. 10 INTERNETS FOR YOU.
<PsychoticDoc> you dont get a weapon for a little while
<Fluttercry> 05,15SirGanjalf considering that's how we got Portal and Counter Strike I wouldn't be surprised
<Shizuka> 13it abuses crouch jumps
<Shizuka> 13the normal jump is worthless
<Lonko> SirGanjalf: 90% of the people who worked on this already have jobs in the games industry
<Cynder7> 6How often does it rain there?
<LightningDashFast> lag
<name> ...
<MadSurge> XAX: 10 internets? :$ Why thanks!
<Noob709> Crouch jumps are MLG then.
<Lonko> You think hobbyists could have made this?
<name> oo a candy var
<name> oh wait its a flare
<Fluttercry> 05,15Jaysus
<Barbetos> The only thing I found myself asking at this part is, where the hell did all the flares come from?
<XAX> Shizuka: dat rebound flare
<Kandarihu> Lonko, hobbyists DID make this
<Barbetos> Like did the flare fairy run around placing a bunch everywhere?
<Cades> hmm, every 2 weeks or so
<DerpyMuffins> Does he ever reload?
<PsychoticDoc> Barbetos: from people trying to find out why the powers shorting out
<Kandarihu> So THAT is what you do with the flares.
<Lonko> Kandarihu: In their free time. But their skills are not the ones of hobbyists
<Cades> probably a bit less
<Allegr0> "This shit's like something out of a videogame!"
<SirGanjalf> imho Zombies sounds less scary than in HL2
<Barbetos> Chow time in the break room
<Lonko> They were professionals
<PsychoticDoc> lol
<MadSurge> COOK IT
<name> lollet it our
<Buytoast> well said random ghuard

<XAX> Hand the zombie some toilet paper.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I wonder if Barney will ever show up
<Kandarihu> What the HECK! That poor headcrab in the microwave!

<twilight_sprinkle> DarkStratos: si
<Fluttercry> 05,15Did they ever explain the baby picture is Freeman's locker?
<DarkStratos> IT WILL SPOIL IT!
<XAX> Fluttercry: nu ;_;
<Shizuka> 13canonically Barney was the guard stuck outside the door during the train ride
<Barbetos> They should of made a special model for that part, like a zombie with TP attached to his shoe.
<name> brb
<Lonko> I love the line of the first guard "Oh, man, you cut the pony tail! - Sellout!"
<XAX> canonically. word of the day.
<weeping_pegasi82> blind them with your flashlight!
<DerpyMuffins> This is one smart AO
<XAX> Lonko: Lol'd as well
<Barbetos> I remember when blue watch came out with its HD models
<DerpyMuffins> AI
<Barbetos> That was awesome.
<Barbetos> take it back!
<Fluttercry> 05,15Follow the dead body road
<VioletLynnScraton> LOL
<Barbetos> Almost the whole clip?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ah! Why the hell did that blow up!
<theprovencher> dont step in the blood
<VioletLynnScraton> ccchhhHHHHAAAIIIIRRR
<Kandarihu> Stuck outside the door... as in the guard who complained about Gordon cutting off his ponytail?
<SirGanjalf> Need a crowbar here!
<name> mr chair noooo
<Lonko> The best scene of Freeman's Mind is where he enters the room with the scientists and they are listening to hardcore techno
<weeping_pegasi82> chair hates you
<Lonko> "TURN the music DOWN!"
<Fluttercry> 05,15Kandarihu no the one banging on the door
<Barbetos> Give me yo gun fooo!

<SirGanjalf> Or turn it off and on again
<Cades> :/
<weeping_pegasi82> killer crab
<Lonko> Fluttercry: lol, they should have put him in the Team FOrtress 2 dimension for a few seconds there at the accident
<Kandarihu> I don't remember a guard banging on the door in the beginning. Is this another train ride?
<Noob709> >ignite headcrab
<Shizuka> 13WHO'S THE SELLOUT NOW
<DerpyMuffins> Hot patato

<Lonko> WHO would BUILD such a Room with no bottom?
<Cynder7> 6*le_sigh*
<theprovencher> ded
<SirGanjalf> Lonko: Black Mesa
<LightningDashFast> dang
<Fluttercry> 05,15Lonko Black Mesa is a monument to misspending
<Barbetos> http://derpy.me/v2zfZ Ponytail.
<SirGanjalf> Lonko: Aperture Science likes that type of architecture too.
<Kandarihu> Crowbar!
<name> a c mettaic stick
<LightningDashFast> crowbar
<thelonepony> Crowbar time!!!
<Cades> i lost the game :/
<Lonko> Fluttercry: There are a couple of rooms in Half-Life that are just like "What the fuq? This must have cost millions of dollars for a pointless room."
<LightningDashFast> yay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wow you get the crowbar way later in this version
<XAX> Barbetos: motherofgod
<weeping_pegasi82> poke them with your crowbar
<MadSurge> OSHA completely disregarded Black Mesa
<Fluttercry> 05,15like the box crushing room
<SirGanjalf> Fluttercry: Then how would you call Aperture?
<Barbetos> Crowbar all the things
<SirGanjalf> Crowbar Time!
<Kandarihu> King Arthur finds his weapon in a stone. Link finds his weapon in the Lost Woods. Gordon Freeman finds his weapon stuck in a door.
<alexxm> crowbar all the things
<SpadeMagnes[R]> "I am working with a bunch of lemmings"
<Barbetos> omnomnom
<Fluttercry> 05,15Also, the blood getting on the suit and weapons is a nice touch
<Noob709> And later in the game series, Gordon's crowbar skill is nerf.
<XAX> Fluttercry: Bullsquid spit in dark area on weapons = awesome
<nonody2> Oh look the rage zombie
<AJIsAwesome> dat blue screen
<Fluttercry> 05,15ooookay
<Barbetos> That is how most people react to blue screens

<Kandarihu> Barbetos, after what happened to me this morning, I can attest to that
<Barbetos> The IRONY!!

<SirGanjalf> eww, crowbar is all in alien goo
<Phase4> 00,02Fluttercry, i think it ran out of ammo
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kinixys! :)
<weeping_pegasi82> I have to go doctor who is almost on
<Barbetos> party hard!
<VioletLynnScraton> LOL
<SirGanjalf> "I AM MELTING"
<LightningDashFast> pinkie pie style
<Lonko> I figured the whole story of Black Mesa out
<Barbetos> um
<Kinixys> alexxm: Sorta good. I'm back on my desktop at least. :D
<Barbetos> what?
<Lonko> "And then the Anti-Matter Nation attacked!"
<XAX> Let it... snow?
<Barbetos> Whatever!
<Kinixys> I guess this is the new HL source game.
<Lonko> Fluttercry: Did they put in the guard who gets cut in half by the laser?
<Kandarihu> Kinixys, yup.
<Noob709> Kinixys: Eeyep!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hit it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do it
<DerpyMuffins> Wait
<SirGanjalf> Crate smashing time!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Boom
<Fluttercry> 05,15Lonko I think it was a scientist getting gibbed in this one
<name> lol
<XAX> Shizuka: Somethign that kind of irked me about this game is the amount of crates that don't have ammo in them.
<SirGanjalf> except those with "Danger. Explosives" written on them:|
<Shizuka> 13it's the big ones with tarps
<Barbetos> nap time
<Shizuka> 13though usually health in those
<LightningDashFast> Boom
<Lonko> XAX: Why would a science lab have ammo crates, anway
<name> ....
<VioletLynnScraton> Buffershow season 3!
<Fluttercry> 05,15Lonko it's Black Mesa...what do you expect from that place?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony wut game we watchin?
<VioletLynnScraton> I gotta go guys, Bye! and may the wubz be with you
<SirGanjalf> Lonko: They were probably researching something for military.
<Kandarihu> I always made it a point to break every crate I saw
<Fluttercry> 05,15The security guards carry grenades
<Barbetos> Lonko they are a government paid institute with a private security team.
<LightningDashFast> yeah that doesnt make sense
<Kandarihu> ...except for the ones with the red lining
<name> he lives
<XAX> Shizuka: Yeah, I guess so. But like... 1 out of 2 crates had ammo in them in HL1
<Lonko> At least Black Mesa is not as crazy as Aperture. Given that Black MEsa is government funded and Aperture is privat
<LightningDashFast> O.O
<name> box attack
<Lonko> lol, sure, they would use grenades in such an institute
<Barbetos> A Wild Box has appeared!
<Lonko> Tazers would be enough
<Noob709> Lonko: Aperture is just full of AI, really.
<name> gordon uses smack
<theprovencher> Ded
<Barbetos> ouch

<Kandarihu> Er, right. Sorry
<SirGanjalf> Ok, that was funny
<Barbetos> This is why you use the PROPER tools for the job kids
<SirGanjalf> death by a ladder
<Barbetos> Oh hai there!
<Lonko> I hope they put in some references to Aperture in Black Mesa Source
<Fluttercry> 05,15Gman on the balcony

<Kandarihu> What the heck are you supposed to do about the Houndeyes? They're so hard to dodge
<Lonko> This shit is getting ridicolous
<Fluttercry> 05,15Oh god I killed. what if it was an ambassador or something?

<[SWAG]Haku> IM AFRAID OF HIEGHTS
<Kandarihu> Back when we had to figure out our games for ourselves instead of having everything spelled out by these new-fangled tutorial stages.
<Shizuka> 13no surprise houndeye :<
<Kandarihu> AND WE LIKED IT!
<M3AD0W> You should reply to my topic in the forum....in the section SpyroChat
<weeping_pegasi82> smash smash
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu, are you streaming? :3
<Noob709> Kanda: I miss those days.

<AJIsAwesome> ohai LadyCanary :)
<[SWAG]Haku> SUDDENLY BOOM
<Mayonaiize> I don't know how to use this shit haha
<[SWAG]Haku> FLY LIKE AN EAGLE
<weeping_pegasi82> I like how the camera sways when you change directions it's a nice touch
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: i watched a video analyzing the design of megaman levels. they were designed to present things such that you could figure things out as you go
<Shizuka> 13shizu freeman needs a grappling hook :<
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Mayonaiize> Yeah it is
<[SWAG]Haku> at the ghosties?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well newer games are more complex than old games like mario, so it makes sense that they would need a tutorial
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, Egoraptor's Sequelitis 2? Yeah
<NullRadix> maybe, I honestly forget the video name
<weeping_pegasi82> so awesome /)^3^(\
<Cades> you mind if i call you meadow?
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Kandarihu> [SWAG]Haku, soaring gracefully like an eagle... piloting a blimp
<Mayonaiize> same here
<twilight_sprinkle> bonk-
<M3AD0W> Not at all. Thats my nickname.
<[SWAG]Haku> IM ON A BLIMP
<weeping_pegasi82> bonk-load
<[SWAG]Haku> IM ON A BLIMP
<M3AD0W> M3D0W is just how I pronounce it on the forums
<Noob709> Kanda: If anyone wanted a tutorial in those days, they'd read the manual!
<M3AD0W> *M3A0W
<[SWAG]Haku> 100%?
<Cades> ok haha
<[SWAG]Haku> GIVE ME 110!
<Cades> XD
<M3AD0W> UGHHHH!!!! *M3AD0W
<weeping_pegasi82> ew he barfed at you
<Cades> have you played dotd?
<Shizuka> 13it's awesome it covers your weapon
<Mayonaiize> Lol
<[SWAG]Haku> Punch it
<XAX> Shizuka: I love the effect of the spit on your we-- oh.
<weeping_pegasi82> nice detail
<M3AD0W> Thats the one I have not played.
<RaveBrony> Huh. Theres actually a good Rarity plush in that compilation. Not too many of those, due to her hair.
<M3AD0W> :-(
<Cypresswolf> Its a C'Thulu dog
<M3AD0W> Eternal Dragon though
<Cades> you should play it :p
<weeping_pegasi82> chat is slower now
<[SWAG]Haku> i preper cat smyself
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't watch plush compilations they remind me of something i can not have
<[SWAG]Haku> indeed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> cause those are too damn expensive
<Cades> I raged through the eternal night haha. still a really sick game though :P
<thelonepony> eeyup
<[SWAG]Haku> it just like, went into the slow lane when that podcast ended
<AJIsAwesome> yep
<Kandarihu> I watched a the clime just cleared off her weapon
<weeping_pegasi82> tis a shame
<M3AD0W> In DotD...can you actually fly?
<[SWAG]Haku> indeed
<Kandarihu> slime
<RaveBrony> Yeah, hehe
<Cades> yup :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Ok, so...
<Cypresswolf> HL MNS is now in top 3 of ginpbbhtbid list
<Cypresswolf> BMS
<[SWAG]Haku> Anyone mind if I pitch a story idea?
<M3AD0W> I'm going to get it. Gotta beat New Beginning and Eternal first though
<weeping_pegasi82> only a true gamer would try to hit bugs with a crowbar
<[SWAG]Haku> Ive been wanting to someone opinion on it, see if people would read a story like it
<Cades> you'll finish anb really quickly. ten takes ALOT longer :P
<Cypresswolf> :D that maze
<Kandarihu> And anyway, I gotta admit. PSO2 is a pretty big offender of the Tutorial stage. But it presents a rather odd twist to it.
<Noob709> I can't reach the fire exit without first reaching plenty of dead ends!
<RaveBrony> Meh. Regardless of price I cant have a mlp plushie. Not only am i not too crazy for one, I get insulted enough from my friends and family. I dont need to add more material to their crude jokes.
<Shizuka> 13ah the box smashing room
<Cades> hey shibaru
<weeping_pegasi82> box smashers dream come true
<Cypresswolf> I like how they added a floor
<[SWAG]Haku> Basically, while banished on the moon, Luna was conscience the entire 1000 years. To combat insanity, she made her own imaginary friends. The story is about her coming to grips with reality when she comes back, and how she has to realize that all of her closest friends dont exist.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!!!!!!!!
<M3AD0W> I don't know if you read reviews, but they weren't all so kind to Eternal Knight hahaha
<Dark92Enigma> Who won the lottery?
<[SWAG]Haku> Would anyone read a story like that?
<Cades> yeah. i dont understand why :P
<weeping_pegasi82> i guess
<AJIsAwesome> [SWAG]Haku: It seems very interesting. You should make it happen.
<Dark92Enigma> i would do it
<M3AD0W> Is DotD better though? Than the others?
<AJIsAwesome> AAAAAND DED?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Good thing about where i live, no one really cares about anything besides they own
<weeping_pegasi82> interesting jump...
<Cades> its better in some ways, worse in others
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: not you. i only remember hanumitsukufan or someth like that won
<Cypresswolf> [SWAG]Haku: I'd read a story like that
<weeping_pegasi82> oops
<LadyCanary> Eep D:
<AJIsAwesome> oow
<[SWAG]Haku> Geez, that guy must do craZy squats
<XAX> Shizuka: falling victim to the useless jumping i see
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<MadSurge> K guys, bed time for me. Nighty <3

<Cypresswolf> Goodnight MadSurge
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Night! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye MadSurge
<Kandarihu> I kind of figured that if there were a way to the other doors in that room, Shizuka might know how, but I guess there aren't.
<M3AD0W> Do you like Enter the Dragonfly or a Heroes Tale also?
<weeping_pegasi82> jump jump jump
<Kandarihu> isn't.
<LadyCanary> Wimpy wwimpy wimpy.
<Cades> yup

<weeping_pegasi82> bonk
<[SWAG]Haku> ninja'd
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep as long as you don't go shoving it in people faces they don't care :p
<RaveBrony> Well, its not like its harsh jokes. Just silly banter. Its just got really old, really fast.
<[SWAG]Haku> KILL IT WITH DEATH
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: yeah i never win either <.<
<RaveBrony> *It just

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my responce "Yeah, want one ?" nothing else :p
<Cades> But from what ive seen, its not terribly impressive
<Cades> hey kimori
<Kandarihu> You're bringing that corpse with you?
<M3AD0W> hahaha Spyro looks deformed in that game seriously
<[SWAG]Haku> Why not?
<weeping_pegasi82> doom creature anyone?
<Shizuka> 13i like the more hl2 pace of running
<[SWAG]Haku> It'll instill fear into his prey
<Kimori> Skylanders has become another series that collectors are trying to go for now
<Cynder7> 6It looks like a decentish game..kinda reminded me of AHT..
<weeping_pegasi82> take the corpse
<RaveBrony> I found it through a silly commentary video on episode 3. It led me to 'Winter Wrap-Up song', I sung it all through the week of Christmas, and thought 'Let me see what the actual show is about'. I didnt even know of bronies :D
<[SWAG]Haku> And eat it!
<Kimori> There are so many different things to look out for that are uncommon, like some of the skylander figures
<[SWAG]Haku> Only then will you gain its powers
<MirrorImage> nom
<Cades> yeah
<RaveBrony> I think if someone tried to get me hooked on it, i wouldve hated the show, lol
<M3AD0W> So true. I plan to start collecting.
<thelonepony> damn!
<weeping_pegasi82> *whisper*I don't think she's listening

<otakon> bloody hell
<Shizuka> 13ammo is stupidly scarce
<Kandarihu> I hear that it only goes up to the Lambda Core chapter. Is that true?
<Shizuka> 13also oatkun you misunderestimate the amount of time i have to waste
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's right up until you enter the lambda portal
<Shizuka> 13so about 90%
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: So the game is incomplete?
<weeping_pegasi82> :P
<Kandarihu> So I guess there will be an update to this in the future that finishes the story?
<weeping_pegasi82> whoa
<Kandarihu> Or will there be a followup called Xen Source?
<Rex_Mundi> So who do you think is the most wel known brony artist? johnjoseco probobly.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Depends on what genre.
<Shizuka> 13i would call this complete
<Shizuka> 13they will release xen eventually
<AJIsAwesome> ALright.
<Shizuka> 13the original xen was pretty dumb, so they have a lot of polish to do
<Shizuka> 13hopefully not another eight years
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This took 8 years?
<Noob709> I heard that first.
<AJIsAwesome> SO this is HL2: Ep 3?
<Noob709> inb4 8 years.

<DerpyMuffins> Yea
<otakon> Shizuka: so stuck?
<twilight_sprinkle> i think they mean that th goo was somewhere else
<otakon> ugh I hate the laddes
<Ingwaz> DerpyMuffins: they probably have to have the prereaders look at it, which i imagine theres a bit of a waiting list for. did you make sure to send it to the right email address?
<twilight_sprinkle> in some pipe
<twilight_sprinkle> or mayb the aliens did it
<twilight_sprinkle> o it just teleported the goo
<twilight_sprinkle> *or
<DerpyMuffins> Well last time I sent it in, my story didnt even reach teh prereaders
<DerpyMuffins> They told me to revise and edit
<otakon> dude it takes time
<otakon> that's all
<DerpyMuffins> And change NMMs text
<Ingwaz> did you do as they instructed? from what i know, the prereaders are pretty strict DerpyMuffins

<Noob709> Shizu: Sir, what if Dari was american?
<Shizuka> 13sir?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again with the fucking american insults
<otakon> Noob709: then he would have said "If I had a dollar"
<prince-dari> Called "The Queen's Nose", where there was a 50p that granted wishes
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: what insults?
<Shizuka> 13i am not sir

<Ingwaz> SpadeMagnes[R]: there is no we in this
<DerpyMuffins> So far my story has nothing to do with romance, just drama between Luna and NMM
<Noob709> Shizu: You don't own a time travel machine, silly.
<Ingwaz> hmmm...this seems safe...and not ambushable at all
<HoodyNinja> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I like to think the chat is in Gordon's HUD and we're all inside his head
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Shizuka> 13what do you think quicksave is silly?
<magmablock> Gordon has a collective conscience
<Ingwaz> that blood stain on the wall is a nice choice of decoration
<prince-dari> Quicksave is best TARDIS
<Noob709> Shizu: What's worse is savestate abuse in emulators isin't time consuming.
<twilight_sprinkle> i have blood stains all over my place
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: that means that when the stream is over, we all die
<Ingwaz> i think theyre dead?
<HoodyNinja> Shizu is best doctor

<emangamer> prince-dari: S7E1 really wasnt that bad
<HoodyNinja> And
<HoodyNinja> Over
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why do you hate matt smith?
<kirzstryfe> knew it
<flutterchu> phoenix wright vs gordon freeman
<emangamer> and it's not the actor, it's the writing that's gone down hill
<Noob709> dari: Obsess.
<prince-dari> Not this question again
<kirzstryfe> Shizu kills all
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: apparently someone hates the 11th doctor witha passion
<prince-dari> It is the acting.
<Ingwaz> fail...
<emangamer> Dari, since moffet left the writings sucked
<flutterchu> another prince-dari awakening,im surprised
<weeping_pegasi82> someone's angry
<Noob709> eman: The Tardis recently contracted cancer?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You don't have to sound like you hate it with a passion
<prince-dari> There have been eps where the writing isn't bad, but the acting is always bad.
<weeping_pegasi82> *hobble*
<Ingwaz> BOOM
<Ingwaz> HEADSHOT
<HoodyNinja> YOU DEAD, BITCH!
<emangamer> prince-dari: his acting during the god complex was pretty good
<DoctorWhoovesMLP> damn you stole my comment Ingwaz
<prince-dari> If you say so, I didn't notice
<emangamer> prince-dari: also, point of interest, when he opened the door, the tardis distress noise was playing
<emangamer> thoughts?
<twilight_sprinkle> dat ambience
<HoodyNinja> The Tardis was in distress?
<flutterchu> acording to facebook here what micheal said: Sorry, BFDI can't come out today. I, Michael, have been completely unable to work on BFDI for the past month due to school and now illness, and right now BFDI is something humanly impossible for me to tend to. At this point, I can't be sure when BFDIA 4 will come out. I'm really sorry that this is has happened, and I most certainly do not find pleasure in not delivering BFDI to you, so
<twilight_sprinkle> tl;dr
<AJIsAwesome> Who's Micheal?
<AJIsAwesome> Plus your text cut off.
<prince-dari> I might care if I knew what BFDI was.
