<ben1994> poof
<Colt_of_Personality> Rainbow Dash can control the weather, bu never gets a chance to use that power
<Soupjuice> where did scott pilgrim come from with those symbols?
<otakon> damn that's dangerous
<Big_Jakeintosh> I used to think baby chickens were cute until I got a job at a hatchery I get annoyed everytime I look at one now
<Ictiv> I have a quick question: How good a movie is Revenge of the Nerds from 1 to 10 where 1 is "okay" 10 is "Worth staying up all night for" and 2-9 are there becasue they are nice numbers and they don't hurt anyone?
*paraKirz eats the sandvich at the bottom of the bin and multiplies until it explodes
<Meanwhile> Nope
<ben1994> ooooh dat hurt
