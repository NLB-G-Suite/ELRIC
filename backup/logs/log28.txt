<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I definitely won't miss out on Starship Troopers, I've heard so much about it
<Dee_Twenty> You know, Starship Troopers is actually meant to be a PARODY of the old army recruitment propaganda, so not really sure it counts as a B movie.
<BlueBerryMuffin> :D
<Whiteeyes> So what's next?
<charmin> troopers ftw
<PKThunder> I missed the movie.
<jpony> I had some occasional lag
<Killsteal_Wolf> Was going to vote for Lady and the Tramp or Tropic Thunder, but oh well, wasn't even in the top 10.

<SirSprinkles> If we need to mute the chat later.
<Rivets> it's a shitty movie based on a great novel. it counts as a B movie
<Dave_BroZilla> Starship Troopers does get a touch violent, but it's so hilariously cheesy it's forgivable
<Zeeee> 0was gonna pick Scott Pilgrim

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original cut of the movie was almost twice as long as the final cut, and it was considered by all involved to be an abysmal failure. It was only after a marathon cutting session that they produced the final cut of the film, which both Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks considered to be far superior to the original product.
<Silverscreen> 11At one point they noted that for every joke that worked, there were three that fell flat. So they went in and trimmed all the jokes that didn't work.
