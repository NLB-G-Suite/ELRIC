<Iks> no he isnt
<Pontang> English.
<Pontang> xD
<prince-dari> I'll look in a minute.
<RobotPinkie> He used to jump up in my lap, but refused to be in anyone else's. Such a sweet little loner.
<Wrek> 05ofc
<banannagram> ?
<Pontang> So what was the paper about?
<MrPoniator> He's generally keeping posts apart by one hour or so
<banannagram> no paper
<Ponyfan> mrponinator
<gingerale> But this is so shiny... and great.. and powerful!
<Pontang> =x
<banannagram> I'm a freshman, the work is light
<FloofCat> My orange cat is not a lap cat, but he's friendly otherwise. The little one loved laps. http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/304183_283799614968261_100000146743751_1317676_5354700_n.jpg
<Pontang> I see.
<MrPoniator> What, Ponyfan?
<Pontang> College?
<RobotPinkie> awww, FloofCat
<banannagram> still more than I was used to
<banannagram> hs
<Pontang> Ah
<banannagram> :p
<Ponyfan> nigga stole my bike
<Pontang> A young one. ;O
<Pontang> I feel old now. :(
<FloofCat> My orange cat is Floof; the little one had been named Fluffy, but that was too close... so I was calling it "Derpy Muffin".
<RobotPinkie> That is such an adorable kitty
<banannagram> :)
<Pontang> I remember my freshman year in high school. I ended up flunking English because I never did anything.
<Iks> i wonder if i can load the model in c4d
<Pontang> >.>;
<MrPoniator> Ookay
<RobotPinkie> lol good name
<FloofCat> My best friend adopted it and gave it another new name... because I can't get him to stand ponies yet. Problem is, his folks decided to nickname it "Snips"... :P
<Ponyfan> se on katso mun vitun hienoo pyorää
<RobotPinkie> ...oh noes
<MrPoniator> Näin saattaapi olla
<banannagram> if I got less than a b my mom would get on my case
<IAmBawss> Hey, everypony.
<JackiePie> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:16h:49m:22s
<FloofCat> Good afternoon, Bawss.
<Twilight_Blaze> Well, I gotta poof. School and all. I may come back on sometimes though. Thanks everypony!
<banannagram> she seems more, I dunno, worried than in middle school
<banannagram> not worried
<RobotPinkie> hay IAmBawss
<MrPoniator> Alrighty--....
<MrPoniator> And he left quickly
<gingerale> Psh, school at 23:10
<IAmBawss> It is spelled "IAmBawss" but it is pronounced "Throat Warbler Mangrove"
<gingerale> Such lies. :(
<MrPoniator> Asian?
<ValtheJean> and back
<FloofCat> If you say so... never mind me.
<ValtheJean> and what do I think of what?
<Pontang> Well, High school is where it accounts.
<RobotPinkie> having a short pony music break today, and listening to some Nick Lowe instead. So. Awesome.
<IAmBawss> Name that reference, lololololol
<Wrek> 05this: www.livestream.com/johntb
<gingerale> Might've been an aussie ^^
<banannagram> yeah
<ValtheJean> well it appears to be a link
<MrPoniator> That too
<ValtheJean> a link leading towards some place
<EspyLacopa> Nah
<ValtheJean> it's very....linky
<IAmBawss> Damn it.
<Pontang> If you graduate and decide not to go to college, it follows you forever. If you do go to college, well, it still follows you forever. You can't go to Harvard on a 2.0GPA.
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> Anypony a fan of shooting games? like bullet hells?
<DibromYAY> whats with the stream
<Iks> i once was
<Iks> ahh quake 2... the good ol days
<banannagram> my school is an early college
<FloofCat> I'm seeing a "2 hours plus" until next stream, so I'd say... nothing.
<RobotPinkie> what stream?
<Wrek> 05no shit
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> this is a different kind of shooting game =P
<MrPoniator> I like Sin & Punishment 2, triggerheart Exelica, DoDonPachi, Ikaruga and so forth
<banannagram> virtually everyone there is going to go
<ValtheJean> :P
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> the side scrolling ones
<gingerale> Not really.. Just played DoDonPachi, Vasara, PSI somethingorother and Ketsui Death Label. :B
<Pontang> Ah
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> if RainbowDash was a playable character
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> what would her attacks be?
<ValtheJean> right now I'm getting a red bull advertisement
<ValtheJean> so I can't really comment on the stream :P
<banannagram> early colleges let you take college courses
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> this is in theory but I may be making a Rainbow Dash bullet hell
<banannagram> starting in sophomore year
<MrPoniator> Probably something rainbow-ish
<gingerale> Single straight burst.
<ValtheJean> ah, there it does
<Pontang> Most schools have AP programs.
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> shooting isn't really cannon for RBD though
<ValtheJean> it's looking good wrek
<MrPoniator> With her 'bomb' being sonic rainboom
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> I was thinking of making her bombs the sonic rainboom
<banannagram> what's an AP program?
<gingerale> Your usual newbie character. ^^
<Pontang> Or IP, whatever they go for.
<MetalRainbowDash> Yaaay were o air
<RobotPinkie> well there might be pre-stream of some sort...
<gingerale> By the way
<gingerale> Jamestown is amazing <3
*EspyLacopa listens to Rainbow Dash's I can go the Distance video again
<banannagram> you mean IB?
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> so what would her normal attack be?
<IAmBawss> *checks schedule* Hell yeah, Rocky Horror Picture Show!!
<Pontang> Lol, yeah
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> I could do melee attacks
<Pontang> Never really had any of those.
<Aristeo> Backwards heart
<ValtheJean> she's staring into my soul O_o
<MrPoniator> So it's her bucking enemies to face?
<banannagram> my middle school was IB
<Pontang> But AP usually lets you carry them on to college.
<banannagram> it was a great school
<IAmBawss> That is one awesome movie.
<FloofCat> Sooner or later, I'm going to have to teach myself video making... I no longer have the excuse of having a junky computer.
<gingerale> I don't really like melee on them unless it's Vasara style where you do slashes strong enough to repel bullets. And only after charging it up.
<Pontang> I don't think IB counts for some colleges or something.
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> I was thinking of something like a flip that creates a slash
<Wrek> 05like always then
<RobotPinkie> oh, so i'm going to have to restart this entire thing again, i guess
<ValtheJean> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Hey guys, if this is the new server, why are we using the old mod channel?
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> yea same but shooting for RBD doesn't really fit unless I gave her a gun and
<IAmBawss> I make AMVs and YouTube Poops when I have nothing else to do.
<MrPoniator> Have her carry Applejack
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> we all know guns + MLP don't really match
<MrPoniator> And AJ is throwing apples
<banannagram> I never learned anything about IB and college
<ValtheJean> I wasn't aware there was a new one >.<
<Pontang> u_u
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> but she would get tired from carrying APJ
<banannagram> or AP and college, really
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgAbLUTb0Lg
<Wrek> 05something wrong with mibbit wiht the other one

<gingerale> I've been thinking of doing a pony bullet hell
<MrPoniator> Hey, it's a game
<IAmBawss> But I've been fairly occupied recently, so I haven't made very many.
<Wrek> 05people keep getting kicked for no reason
<gingerale> But it'd just be Derpy flying with Dinky on her back shooting magic.
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> that's true
<Wrek> 05iirc
<banannagram> college was too far in the future
<FloofCat> I just follow my cat with my camera. For now.
<Thunder_Dash> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Thunder_Dash is 4Big Macint7osh
<gingerale> Instead of the mane cast
<MrPoniator> Launching off muffins, more likely
<RobotPinkie> wow.... I just love the new formatting....
<Pontang> Lucky you
<gingerale> Heh, nah.. ^^
<Silverscreen> 11I'm talking about #Luna and #Celestia, the ones with the pony names.
<Nashy> lightning pewpew
<ValtheJean> oh yeah...I forgot about those
<gingerale> I call the project Atomic Muffin 3000
<Pontang> I'm still debating on whether or not to go to college or just write books. >:o
*IAmBawss has nothing to do.
<Wrek> 05ohes
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> lol
<ValtheJean> did we actually set those up yet?
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link applejack
<Wrek> 05dunno really
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26333
<MrPoniator> Gotta feed them evil monsters with muffins so they wouldn't go after ponies!
<MagicCornCake> this is the second greatest show
<ValtheJean> I was under the impression they hadn't been made
<RandomExtra> @bluemeter Steven_Magnet's test
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven_Magnet's test is 92% blue. (1515)

<LunaOnTheMoon> !link luna
<DerpyBot> http://e621.net/post/show/151126/alicorn-applejack_-mlp-blue_hair-book-cloud-corset
<Nashy> maybe have clouds here and there you can kick so they shoot lightning at foes?
<RandomExtra> ...Well, that was a fail on my part.
<RobotPinkie> @poopmeter Youtube
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Youtube is 34% poop. (1516)
<Silverscreen> 11they aren't, but this one isn't registered either. Not on this server, anyway.
<ValtheJean> oh
*Silverscreen kicks Youtube in the nads.
<RobotPinkie> be right back, I guess
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> I definitely want RBD to shoot something but I don't know exactly what yet
<ValtheJean> in that case: ponyshrug.jpg
<Silverscreen> Youtube has SOUND advertisements playing alongside their videos.
<Thunder_Dash> Is the stream everyone's watching the video with the skype sounds partway through, or am I still lost?
<Wrek> 05there its up on the forums
<stripes> g'day from the land down under
<FloofCat> Have fun... I can hear someone watching the Dead Parrot sketch from Monty Python in another room, going to go join them. Wonder if anyone's done that with Philomena yet...
<Nashy> we know she can kick clouds to produce lightning
<Wrek> 05btw love the newsletters val
<Silverscreen> 11FloofCat: It has been done
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> yea but that'd limit her projectiles
<MrPoniator> Have her carry a cloud around
<mib_s0mhcn> Looks like Veemi's working.
<ValtheJean> awww...ty Wrek :D
<Zephirdd> Silverscreen: adblocker > youtube sound ads
<Zephirdd> :D
<mib_s0mhcn> For the moment.
<ValtheJean> that means a lot coming from an actual artist :P
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> I was thinking of giving her a fluttershy assist
*stripes hands out cute koalas to all..
<banannagram> I like fics
<Wrek> 05hi sathi
<ValtheJean> ohai woona
<banannagram> especially when you know the author and can influence it
<Silverscreen> 11Those newsletters are badass.
<banannagram> well
<banannagram> only when that works out
<ValtheJean> :D ty Silver
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, did you derp the server again?
<Thunder_Dash> I've got the Veemi stream open in one tab, and the UStream one in this tab and neither of them are doing anything...
<Ponyfan> noni
<Pontang> Truth be told, I'm not much into most books. Ends up rambling instead of telling the story.
<Silverscreen> 11Here's the thing though, we only send two newsletters, and the newsletter is sent to EVERYONE registered at once. So am I suppose to just cycle through which one I use?
<CarlG> SPACE
<Nashy> I have a cloud, hahaha!
<Nashy> Lightning shall smite you!
<Silvermane> 10Testing Color Boot Program
<ValtheJean> well, the idea was this:
<Silvermane> 0Alright, that still works at least
<Pontang> One thing I have to give credit to the Harry Potter books (Even if they aren't that good), it was mostly no-nonsense sort of stuff.
<RandomExtra> Veemi's working for me.
<ValtheJean> the newsletter itself is one giant image
<ValtheJean> so, you send one of us the text that needs to be put in there
<Ponyfan> no jään katto my litte ponia
<ValtheJean> and we organize it into various combinations of those boxes
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, it's working in some way
<Silvermane> 0alrighty then...
<ValtheJean> plus a border or something, still working on that
<Kitten> upside down*
<Nashy> I have been assaulted by the Finnish language :(
<Silvermane> 0so what is happening in here
<JackiePie> mon petite pony
<banannagram> it's been so long since I read them I don't remember very much about them
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Wrek> 05http://e621.net/data/c0/03/c0032864f308fe24e05b2dd7ccc6d237.jpg
<ValtheJean> they're basically like, templates if you will
<Iks> damn... soi can load the models into c4d but they got no textures
<Thunder_Dash> I'm still not getting anything from either one
<Silverscreen> 11Nah. It'd be too cluttered for the small amount of information that we put into the newsletter.
<RandomExtra> I suppose that we're waiting for the pre-show to start at the moment.
<ValtheJean> haha, that is awesome wrek
<RobotPinkie> need to reload the page for it to work, I'm guessing...
<banannagram> I remember the last one was a little hard to read because it was so grim
<Silverscreen> 11Now using each image as a background for one newsletter each would work perfectly.
<gingerale> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp_tfncbqLI
<Ohai> Hey... I can see bronystate from Luna's screen!
<MrPoniator> Nashy, sorry about that
<roushguy> I'm boooooored.... and even watching ponies and playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution isn't enough to un-bore me
*stripes waits as well..
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> lol Jackie
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<Pontang> I thought the author was going to go kill-em-all.
<MrPoniator> Ponyfan doesn't seem to be very old and he doesn't know any English
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/55823
<SomeponyElse> Gentlecolts.
<Pontang> Gave me so much hope before that terrible-terrible ending.
<MrPoniator> Tried to communicate here with google translate earlier with little success
<LunaOnTheMoon> or someting like that
*SomeponyElse copious amount of cigarettes
<ValtheJean> in that case, if you want specific dimensions for them let me know and I'll redo them for it
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about celestia bushing portrait artist:virenth
<banannagram> it wasn't that bad
<Thunder_Dash> Hey, there we go!
<banannagram> kill-them-all?
<Nashy> Finnish is a crime that can never be forgiven.
<Thunder_Dash> I'm gonna reconnect on the co.cc page then
<Pontang> It's what happens when you're desperate to come up wit ha happy ending. It comes across as being desperate.
<Pontang> Killing most of the characters off.
<Pontang> It's a troupe.
<Silverscreen> 11 8.5 x 11. Basic paper size.
<banannagram> that would have too much negative impact
<MrPoniator> On top of that, he admitted to having ADHD, so bear with it
<Luna> 07omg can you!
<ValtheJean> alrighty
*Dermathil waves at all the mods around
<Pontang> That's not necessarily a bad thing.
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Pontang> Some of my favorite fiction has sad endings.
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link adhd
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
*Thunder_Dash hugs Luna
<Pontang> At the very least, a bittersweet ending would have worked.
<RandomExtra> Ohai Luna!
<WhatPayne> Oh we have stream?
<WhatPayne> We do!
<banannagram> a ton of people died
<Pontang> I'm pretty critical about how something ends.
<Silverscreen> 11THe ponies themeselves can be any size. It's the colored background that would have to fit the newsletter.
<EspyLacopa> There's a Brony steam group, yes?
<Dermathil> friday movie night today!
<Dermathil> I hink
<[NLR]Lucid> Click click
<banannagram> that's pretty bittersweet
<Dermathil> there's also a BMN group
<MrPoniator> You'd think Derpy would link to Pinkie if ADHD was mentioned
<RobotPinkie> AAAAAAAA
<Pontang> If it doesn't develop a happy ending, it just comes across as trying to pay the reader off.
<Thunder_Dash> BIG ADVENTURE
<MetalRainbowDash> MLP!
<JackiePie> lol
<MetalRainbowDash> :D
<CommodoreZ> PONIES!
<Zephirdd> whaaaa
<InsertCupcake> Suddenly!
<CommodoreZ> And life was good.
<Pontang> I was loling about that tbh. I was thinking about the people dying, but no, it really did come across as trying to be too happy-ish.
<JackiePie> Pinkie: and that's the story of how Equestria was built
<RobotPinkie> I need to reboot, though...
<MetalRainbowDash> Pinkie's Fear Song

<MrPoniator> And that's how Equestria was made* :p
<ValtheJean> kk- I'll start working on them. I'll repost when I have them finished
<banannagram> I guess
<Silverscreen> 11Thank you, Val. They're awesome.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Apples'N'Wrenches (Update Part 3!) (http://tinyurl.com/66h89xr)
<banannagram> I don't realy pay much attention to that sort of thing
<Pontang> Endings are the most important thing in a book (IMO).
<MrPoniator> WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR SETH?!
<Pontang> That is what leaves the impact.
<MrPoniator> YOU SHOULD HAVE POSTED THAT EPIC TRIXIE BY NOW
<CommodoreZ> 9Lol, echo?
<ValtheJean> heh, well they aren't nearly Wrek quality :P
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt say that :o

<stripes> mmm...nice music ....no vid :(
<Thorinair> nuff said
<Silverscreen> 11what Wrek said
<Thunder_Dash> It's awfully quiet for me here, and I don't think it's my computer's volume...
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> Pinkie Pie's service announcement: http://www.youtube.com/user/AlwaysSunnyInFilly?feature=mhee#p/a/u/0/nRx1mCbwOdQ
<ValtheJean> lol, I just put a color filter and removed a few of the details from vectors. You actually draw stuff :P
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> bwaaahh
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> whoops
<Silverscreen> 11Luna is streaming, right?
<banannagram> yeah
<Pontang> I've seen stories go from so sad to a random happy ending because they decided to throw that the character had come back to life becuase he collected all the 'orbs'.
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRx1mCbwOdQ
<Wrek> 05prepping more like it
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> that's the correct one
<Pontang> And this was a slice-of-life story too.
<MetalRainbowDash> SUPRRISEEEE
<MrPoniator> But both basically link to the same video
<banannagram> there was a book I read recently
<Luna> 07maybe you have the stream on mute?
<WhatPayne> TBH the stream is somewhat quiet
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> yea but I didn't want to whore out my channel
<RobotPinkie> There we go, much better.
<Thunder_Dash> I don't have it muted, it's at full volume
<Pontang> Hm?
<MrPoniator> heh
<prince-dari> Stream is quiet.
<CommodoreZ> 0Yeah, it's kinda quiet on my end too. such is life
<MetalRainbowDash> Why dontchya turn up your volume
<banannagram> it killed the main character, and there were tears and anger and stuff, and it was really emotional
<RobotPinkie> yeah very low volume
<Silverscreen> 11Ah.
<MrPoniator> Don't mind it, we all are attention horses!
<MetalRainbowDash> :D
<banannagram> then he lived
<prince-dari> Oh.
<WhatPayne> Oh better
<prince-dari> That's better.
<Thunder_Dash> Cause my headset hates anything above 5 volume, as far as it knows it's more like 95
<RobotPinkie> wow, much better
<Flutteryay> Much better
<banannagram> it worked IMO
<Pontang> lawl
<Thunder_Dash> There we go, thanks Luna~
<stripes> get a decent set oif speakers :)
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> lol :P
<Wrek> 05been some serious troubles with veemi
<Silverscreen> 11So, verdict on yesterday's Test on Live Streaming...?
<Dumori> White text iOS IRC client = way too much effort to read
<ValtheJean> I think it went well, and there was some good comments
<MrPoniator> Especially me, heh
<MetalRainbowDash> Winter Wrap Up, Winter wrap up.
<ValtheJean> there was also a bit of disappointment
<Thunder_Dash> I do have a fairly good set of speakers, I just prefer to use my headset. Force of habit :P
<ValtheJean> but I don't know how much and to what extent
<Wrek> 05and since the alternatives are out of the question after testing, we're hopin for the best
<MetalRainbowDash> Cuz 2 morrow spring is here
<Pontang> Could it work? Sure. Is it likely without some sort of development to tell you that? Not really. If you want to do something like that, you better plan out EVERY detail.

<JackiePie> roflol, PinkiePie turned into Daffy as the flower creature from Duck Amuck
<Pontang> The author tried something different, and I think it paid off.
<Sumica> Oh back to .CO no wonder i wasn't getting a stream.
<banannagram> that works so often
<Thunder_Dash> only Friendship is Magic can make me sing along to a song about dress-making. :P
<prince-dari> We would recommend using www.bronystate.net
<RobotPinkie> ohay Sumica
<banannagram> except in the case of cupcakes
<Pontang> :o
<Sumica> Hi RobotPinkie
<CommodoreZ> 0I hope this streaming thing works out day-of
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Sumica
<Pontang> Well, muffin tops disagrees with you.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'm on bronystate.net, though I really don't like those borders :(
<banannagram> the author doesn't have any other fics like it
<RobotPinkie> oh well, best way to do it is to pop the chat out anyway, I guess
<MetalRainbowDash> Windows sonuds
<MetalRainbowDash> HI APPLEJACK!

<EspyLacopa> .....I need to make sure I get more sleep that friday morning so I can stay up for it.
<ValtheJean> but that was still their opinion
<JackiePie> It was great
<ValtheJean> I'm not saying it's our fault they can't read
<JackiePie> No problem at all with quality
<MetalRainbowDash> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<ValtheJean> that's just how it went =/
<Pontang> You should go to #bronystate if you want more talking. It seems most of the people on here are too busy. :(
<Thunder_Dash> Marathon?
<MrPoniator> Guess I'll be watching S2 through their streams when the eps air

<CommodoreZ> 0Silva Hound does a pretty sweet remix of this song

<RobotPinkie> What about Meet the Feebles?
<The> Yello?
<Zanzibar> Yeah, it wasn't a good use of them at all. They didn't really ruin them for me, it had some nice ideas. But it wasn't even close to as good as the first episode with them.
<roushguy> I think Luna would love me.
<Luna> 07hello
*Wrek is happy for the first time today
<The> Coolness.
<roushguy> I'm hardly, if ever, really awake during the day

<Zanzibar> But then again, as a villain, it's a hard species to write a story on.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I didn't realize there was so many Pony/Avenue Q vids
<roushguy> I mean, I wake up at like 2 pm and go to bed as the sun is rising
<prince-dari> The whole hing about images just made plot holes for Blink though. :/
<ValtheJean> hurray!

<MetalRainbowDash> LOL
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<Zanzibar> Really? I don't think they ever showed an image of them in Blink, did they?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.

<MetalRainbowDash> Yesh you are.
<The> lolnotgay

<ValtheJean> 2,14 I still don't get why filly Celestia has pink hair
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it kinda bothers me
<Nashy> It's from Jayson on Reddit.
<Zephirdd> prince-dari: you gotta watch Toy Story 2 to get the feeling
<WhatPayne> Sad song and pictures
*MetalRainbowDash is close to crying.
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<[NLR]Lucid> D'AWWWWWW
<Thunder_Dash> Val; I'm pretty sure it's because she has pink hair during some of the scenes before the intro in Ep1
<The> Because rainbows are hard to make
<Nashy> When asked if he was prepared from the massive amount of questions.
<Silvermane> 0It's implied that the high magic of her power caused the current hair of Celestia
*WhatPayne haven't seen Toy Story 2 and still feels the sad
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh
<The> luias plot
<MetalRainbowDash> :(
<Nashy> My body is not ready!

<MetalRainbowDash> NO :(
*Silvermane 0likes bananas
<The> These pics are pretty well drawn.
<Zephirdd> ^true
<MetalRainbowDash> What is this song about
<Sumica> See Val Rainbow-ish hair
<prince-dari> Maybe you get some sad music, the dialogue of Tennant's last few minutes in Doctor Who, and ponies together.
<Lixr> Spoiler: Celestia dies
<Nashy> Well, I think it's why it's used in pony related contexts.
<Luna> 07beautiful
<The> lesbians.
<prince-dari> Maybe then you'll be able to make me cry.
*RDash can't draw for anything
<prince-dari> Somehow I doubt it though.

<^PinkiePie> "1 2 3 4 Bunny pron!"
<User_5036> What are we discussing?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 NOTHING is ever emotional if you describe them in those kind of terms dari lol

<RobotPinkie> So conflicted... on one hand, Minecraft version of the song is much funnier, but this has ponies....

<JackiePie> LvS that's fine with a Cold, with a Flu, you have to drink Gatorade or Pedialyte to keep electrolytes in you.
*Silverscreen speaks of it, and it's no longer dead.
<prince-dari> Well we're not getting posted in EQD.
<prince-dari> So...

<Sketchy_Sounds> o.o
<Rainbow_Dash> Wow.. I have never derailed a thread before.. =o
<RAWRity> is there any way to get the chat and vid on the same level?
<RobotPinkie> That's my theory and I'm sticking to it :P

<Zephirdd> lol part 39
<Dash_With_Rainbows> wow part 39 already?
<Apokalipse> bronystate.net won't load for me for some reason
<Bjornfot> SPOILER: trixie is a hun
<[NLR]Lucid> YESSS

<Dash_With_Rainbows> all those having trouble with chat and screen
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ennui.
<herospirit> Why is the stream so far to the right? I had to zoom out two more times than usual
<Dash_With_Rainbows> go to bronystate.net
<RobotPinkie> spoiler: All of the Mane 6 are men because of this video
<LvS> alright, roushguy; is there anything we can do to help you get less bored?
<Dash_With_Rainbows> more updated version

<[NLR]Molestia> awwe
<Sketchy_Sounds> Go on rathergood.com and watch their classics.
<[NLR]Molestia> sorry
<JackiePie> I think the reason they won't sell Strepsils in the US, is because they have antiseptic properties to them.
<Elky> Could a mod put 'Go to bronystate.net if the embeds aren't aligned properly' in the welcome message?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah apart from that N sound...
<JackiePie> Which is weird, but *shrugs*
<ShadTheCrazed> roushguy: If he complains, tell him to deal with it. Easier said than done, but...
<Sketchy_Sounds> Whut
<Dash_With_Rainbows> @Elky good idea
<KanyeNorthEast> well that's better, thanks.
<Elky> because telling everybody might get old
<Dash_With_Rainbows> would stop new people having trouble
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh there's my stop
<VioletVanilla> 6Be a can~

<RAWRity> so are they taking suggestions, or is this all preset?
<DibromYAY> WOOT AWSOME
<Zephirdd> no idea
<herospirit> From the speed of it, I'm guessing preset
<RobotPinkie> preset playlist
<roushguy> I'm only good at sculpting, and I have no clay or potter's wheel
<[NLR]Molestia> As much as I honestly would love to use mibbit to connect to IRC, I think I'll stick with my client.
*ChrisClark13 is not watching stream now...
<Dash_With_Rainbows> fits rainbow dash?

<Combustiblelemons> meh i don't listen to sad songs
<WhatPayne> The gas volume inside the bubble would not change as air would be replaced with carbon dioxide
<DannySwish> XD it scares me.
<Reaver21> I just saw something about twisted Nederland in the related area? the guy that makes the Fail Comps?
<KanyeNorthEast> hellfire would like to have a word with you
<mexican> its a good game
<ProfessorPonV> oh, final question. I also need 1 more pony, a fandom one. And i dont know if it should be Lyra, Bon Bon, or Ditzy.
<Elky> dash_with_rainbows: the tiniest bit. we only absorb about 4% of the air with each breath.
*Sol brofists herospirit
<mexican> derpý!!!!
<Wrek> 05cant say why though, all i can do is to share a hug
<roushguy> DERPY!
<scat> bleh, i forget what the namechange command is

<Spinning_Trixie> Derpy
<Reaver21> Myes, myes. so pretty.
<WhatPayne> And why am I trying to find science from pre G4 show thing??!?!
*ValtheJean hugs wrek back
<GRRM> we plot so many things
<Bjornfot> /nick
<Dark_Heart> wow... this video... is ... AWESOME!!!!!
<GRRM> in that class
<Sol> It's /nick name
<sotha> Lyra!
<mexican> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Spinning_Trixie> Or, alternately, TRIXIE
<Sumica> Ahh did I miss seaponies?
<Mason_Trowel> ORLY?
<Flutteryay> I hate Ghost with every fiber of my being
<GRRM> I giggle like an idiot whenever my professor says 'plot' now
<RobotPinkie> too much fisting, too little hoofing
<scatr> thanks
<sotha> yess
<roushguy> lol
<mexican> haha
<Wrek> 05scat, you are unable to change nick once inside bronystate, leave and re-join to fix it
<Spinning_Trixie> While not fandom, Trixie is the best pony
<Sol> No problem!
<mexican> welcome to the herd
<Elky> dark_heart: refresh your stream, sea ponies are over for us already
<sotha> Sumica, you missed them twice.
<Bjornfot> OHOHO
<ProfessorPonV> Trixi is in it
<RAWRity> robotpinkie that's what SHE said.
<ProfessorPonV> but as a villan
<Sol> lol, problem Wrek?
<Pyroh> Thank celestia for automized cleaning engineering :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, I guess -n isn't on
<Spinning_Trixie> I'm ok with that
<Sumica> Feh damn trafic
<dashy> yea but air is only like 20% oxygen
<Dark_Heart> I know
<Pyroh> All clean ^_^
*VioletVanilla hugs ValtheJean gently~
<Wrek> 05Sol ,no not really
<roushguy> we just need one more pony.
<VioletVanilla> 6I want your bantrident back too. . . v.v
<KanyeNorthEast> its mostly nitrogen
<sklar> Hey guys there a hot new dating site lets goo to it whoogeee
<ValtheJean> <3
<Mason_Trowel> I'll clean it...WITH FIRE!
<Sol> OK, just making sure :)
<mexican> isnt derpy enough?
<Spinning_Trixie> Trixie can be a protagonist, antagonist, ally, or anti-hero
<dashy> so if you obsorb 4% of the air in breath
<sotha> This is really well done.
<ValtheJean> it makes me feel safe at night >.<
<FlutterBro> I've heard that you go crazy if your up high too long
<ProfessorPonV> There is also the Diamond Dogs, And Gilda
<HoMM> it needs to be like 20% oxygen
<RobotPinkie> Hot, RAWRity
<KanyeNorthEast> 100% oxygen isn't good for you at all
<dashy> thats 1/5 of the oxygen
<DuskShine> Ohai Octavia.
<Sol> Ohai Applejack
<Elky> dark_heart: then why 'wow... this video... is ... AWESOME!!!!!'?
<GabeMoist> Ohai Applejack
<ProfessorPonV> im pullin out ALL the stops

<roushguy> Nopony wants to play?
*Dermathil waves at all the mods in chat
<mexican> i cant now
<dashy> 70%nitrogen
<Pyroh> That's a great idea!
<Dash_With_Rainbows> 100% oxygen will knock you out?
<Dark_Heart> this is truly a Rainbow Dash video
<Dermathil> HOW IS EVERYBRONY TODAY?
<Sumica> Ok good you made it Octavia
*Silverscreen 11waves to Dermathil
<Wrek> 05I just have fluttershy enjoying the garden, using the stare at tresspassers
<KanyeNorthEast> its also flamable
<Wrek> 05ohsit
<dashy> not at sealevel
<RAWRity> I'm guessing it would be inappropriate to request one of the "Pony Thread SImulator" vids?
<mexican> i want, but im about to leave from school
<Wrek> 05forget i ever said that
<Octavia> 13That too long enough. x.x
<Octavia> 13Hey guys

<mexican> have been trapped here for 11 hours
<Wrek> 05OCTAVIA
<Amino> Don't light a match with 100% oxygen in the air
<Dash_With_Rainbows> hey octavia!
<dashy> but under pressure oxygen becomes toxic
<WhatPayne> Don't they use 100% oxygen in hospitals?
<Mason_Trowel> Nah, I'm about to turn on Castlevani: SOTN.
<Nittany_Tiger> 76% Nitrogen. 20% oxygen. 2 - 4% Argon. <1% everything else.
*Wrek tackle hugs Octavia
<ProfessorPonV> the main villan hires them as a sort of bounty hunter squad and gives them a gift
*Dermathil waves at bjornfot like the local star he is
<Pyroh> Weve never tested on diamond dogs before :)......Ohhh im gonna need send out a ummmm "search team" ASAP
<dashy> yea pure oxygen is fine so long as youre not diving
<sklar> Silversreen pfftt oxygen i just breathe in awesomeness
<Nittany_Tiger> Oxygen is flammable by itself.
<HaysforPonies> Blaarrgh. I can't write my fic on an empty stomach.
<Elky> hi derma

<FluffyWuffs> !s3

<Dash_With_Rainbows> >mfw everybody is now talking about air
<dashy> hense no smoking near the oxygen

<Amino> btw this song + RBD = win
<Sumica> yes yes we all miss our loved ones and gasses.
<Dermathil> yes it is Elky
<Spinning_Trixie> Lyra, Bon Bon, Derpy, Octavia, Colgate, Vinyl Scratch, upper tier of BG fandom ponies
<KanyeNorthEast> come for the ponies, stay for the discussions on air
<FluffyWuffs> BECAUSE MUFFINS >EVERYTHING ELSE
<Elky> best pmv coming up

<Reaver21> THIS.
<Elky> sorry then
<InsertCupcake> why do I like this so much/
<sotha> "Well, Dash? Aren't you going to say something? Is this nitrogen not good enough for you?" --- "The air's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, breathable. It needs to be about 20% oxygen."
<Trololol> Wanna know the best team ever ;)?
<Elky> so it becomes ozone?
<Bjornfot> This song = Wingest boner.

<WhatPayne> This is my favorite song.
<InsertCupcake> So far Applejack scootaloo and rarity have appeared in my dreams
<Spinning_Trixie> omg
<GabeMoist> Trees
<KanyeNorthEast> Rocky Horror is great, especially if you know all the audience participation lines
<CogWeaver> RAPID FIRE POSTING
<Sol> I can rave to this
<Othrys> thx
<DrActivisionary> did i hear rocky horror?
<Bubblingtoast> id like to be a tree
<FlutterBro> I want pony dreams.....
<Reaver21> This song...what.
<EspyLacopa> So. . .this means we just need a Pinkie, Twilight, and Applejack song.

<Wrek> 05this was a nice one
<Cezar> So why do you have 2 websites? Are you gonna keep em both open?
<Dermathil> this song makes me think of double rainbow somehow
<Dermathil> dunno how
<dashy> scootaloo is totaly a chicken pretending to be a pony
<InsertCupcake> Ill probably be in bed by the time rocky horror is on
*GabeMoist is turning into a tree
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<Synros> is this song a parody?
<Sol> You will believe a pony can be a tree
<RAWRity> never watched Rocky Horror before, hope it's as fun as people have told me it is.
<KanyeNorthEast> i keep thinking of portal
<Synros> sounds familiar
<Combustiblelemons> also, if inception taught me anything- to have a pony dream you've got to plant the idea in your head before you go to sleep
<CogWeaver> because she's programmed to post updates on EqDaily on here
<Wrek> 05Could anyone be so kidn and provide the link?
<Dash_With_Rainbows> same here kanye

<Luna> 07your welcome
<Dermathil> combustiblelemons: I thought everybody always knew that, I did that kind of stuff to kill nightmares when I was a wee kid
<Pyroh> 200 dead, 350 stone, 500 alive, 600 if its unharmed

<RAWRity> octavia yeah, it's pretty neat
<Dash_With_Rainbows> no the Trixie
<Geradex> i have to ad vodka to my hypnotic because it isn't strong enough
<Elky> RAWRity: that's exactly why it's so much fun; other than 40 year old people in drag ofc
<R-Zack> Something from the Pinkie Pie singer article.
<Dermathil> yeah well it sould like that
<Mason_Trowel> Hello, your majesty in socks!
<Spin> I am purely jelly.
<Sol> I'm not really surprised
<sklar> Dermathil 37 took me five hours how long for you
<Dermathil> IMO it was a typo
<Dash_With_Rainbows> the guy/girl who makes those 3D ponies is really talented
<User_2761> I'm guessing we're in the middle of some sort of roleplay Spin.
<Octavia> 13^
<Hybrid616> hi everypony
<Dermathil> wuh Sklar?
<Pyroh> 8 test subjects left, Ya dont ask
<WhatPayne> fin
<Dash_With_Rainbows> Lauren Faust should really check them out
<Pyroh> Where are my diamond dogs!
<KanyeNorthEast> I wonder how much an impact the whole brony thing had on pushing for new seasons
<Elky> I think they'll go at least four seasons.
<Combustiblelemons> YAY

<Dash_With_Rainbows> now loving this even more
<Dermathil> OH
<Zephirdd_> man I love this music
<Elky> :P
<dashy> music for insomniacs
<Zephirdd_> Helps me sleep *-*
<Spin> Sweet! I'll play the role of the lurker.

<sklar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRcAvDaV-24 here this guys
<GabeMoist> 10000000000000000 Fluttershys
*ProfessorPonV

<Dermathil> 37 is the longass chapter I think?
<Dermathil> Took me about 4 hours
<Pyroh> Chopped in unexceptable
<KanyeNorthEast> then again, a lot of that fandom was made up of annoying ass shippers so...
*ProfessorPonV throws in 3 stone statues
<Sol> DAT LUNA
<R-Zack> Nice background.
<Elky> whatpayne: what do you mean by butcher?
*Silverscreen 11goes to put his pizza in the oven.

<EbonDusk> What song is this!!!
<Sketchy_Sounds> YAY I FINISHED CODING
<Combustiblelemons> New lunar republic ftw.
<Pyroh> Ok thats 1050 bits
<User_2761> Lurking is not very fun... At least for me...
<Spin> *lurk*
<KanyeNorthEast> as long as Lauren Faust and the creative team is there I think the show is safe from meddling
<LunaTheForgotten> The Luna Republic!
<Combustiblelemons> this is owl city parody- fluttershies i think
<Hybrid616> ok then.
<KanyeNorthEast> its once they start slowly flushing the writers that you can worry
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/law_draw/ I'm a freaking machine, I swear.
<Dash_With_Rainbows> yes it is
*Pyroh hands bits to Pon and andriods drag off the statues
<R-Zack> Hey hybrid!
<ProfessorPonV> gratsi, i will now see if i can find an assistant
<dashy> isnt Lauren not directing MLP though?
<Geradex> just don't lurk around my penis and we will be ok
<Sol> Luna as Celestia's age/height = <3
<RobotPinkie> HNNNNNNG
<Bjornfot> silverscreen... does it have a hole in teh middle?
<Geradex> unless you are a hot girl
<Wrek> 05!
<Geradex> then thats acceptable

<KanyeNorthEast> she's still there, she's busy being pregnant
<Dash_With_Rainbows> mom just brouhg tme some popcorn
<Pyroh> Come find us again when you have more..."Supplies"
*LunaTheForgotten goes to look for snacks
<Wrek> 05my computer parts arrive tomorrow!
<R-Zack> She stepped down from executive producer, I think.
<Geradex> but creepy neckbeards... my penis is a no fly zone
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she is just not the main producer now
<Reaver21> yes, some Luna Music would be nice. Hows about "lower the Moon"?
<Dash_With_Rainbows> brought*
<Pyroh> We will always pay
<User_2761> I'm a dude.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but she still has some influence
<WhatPayne> By butcher I mean rapping dogs, and constant pop-culture references, seaponies and whatnot
<Dash_With_Rainbows> im ready for movies
<Geradex> then no hanging around my penis
<RAWRity> I think (or at least hope) Hasbro is smart enough to not try and fuck with the show when they have such a big fanbase
<Spin> User_2761: es okay I just can't Rp for the life of me so I rather not get in the way plus I have plent else to do on the internet
<dashy> ohh good
<Sketchy_Sounds> Can we keep the penis talk out of the PG channel, please?
*Wrek is lit up at higher lumos than the sun!
<EspyLacopa> Defying Gravity!
<GabeMoist> NO RAPPING DOGS
<GabeMoist> NO
<Geradex> my bad wrong channel
<Spectrum> hey everypony.
<Synros> 10 million fluttershy's.....my god!
<GabeMoist> NO
<R-Zack> I still wonder why we still have pink celestias.
<Geradex> my windows got all messed up
<Dash_With_Rainbows> hey spectrum!
<dashy> let it run for a couple more seasons before movies.... movies bring money and money can make things go to hell
*Spectrum loves this song
<Geradex> i will bow out for now
<R-Zack> Hasbro Y U BE TROLLIN SO MUCH?
<geosha> hi
<KanyeNorthEast> I just am astounded how awful all the toys look to me
<User_2761> Are there other chanels?
<Sol> ...Did someone say.,.. Wicked song?

<InsertCupcake> this is making me fall asleep
<Combustiblelemons> PINK celestia anyone? :P
<R-Zack> Im not sure, Bjornfot
<Zephirdd> R-Zack: that'd be Past Sins
<ValtheJean> I need your opinion on something
<Sketchy_Sounds> This is why people need to learn to read the bucking topic.
<RobotPinkie> Pinkcess Pinklestia is best Pinkcess
<KanyeNorthEast> Is it mandatory for hasbro to make ugly looking toys for my little pony?
<Wrek> 05who?
<Pyroh> Molocule ray frequency is set!
<Fluttershy> 10 million of me... o-o
<ValtheJean> was playing around with the weirdo settings and filters that photoshop has
<Spectrum> PAST SINS SHOULD BE A MOVIE
<Spectrum> I AGREE
<ValtheJean> everyone :P
<RAWRity> I would be alright if them did like a Made for TV movie
*Spectrum hugs Fluttershy
<Elky> I doubt Hasbro would ruin the show; they'd probaby just cancel it
<WhatPayne> I believe sold Hasbro do that they would face very angry very Brony crowd with torches and pitchforks.
<Spectrum> Heya!
<Pyroh> Fantastic
<LunaTheForgotten> Who wants a Yoo-Hoo?
<ValtheJean> but here's a more revised edition of the signature

<R-Zack> Haha...wait.
<R-Zack> What?
<RAWRity> sephirdd: meh, I've read about the premise, and while it seems interesting, it's not really something I wanna chekc out.
<Dash_With_Rainbows> actually tied between Pizza Hut and Dominos
<Combustiblelemons> silverscreen: a small time business pizza place
*Silverscreen 11gives points to Sol for awesome reference and Espy for awesome response.
<Flutteryay> it's a local pizza place.
<Aponymous> Silverscreen: This place by my house that gives my family a discount.
<KanyeNorthEast> i'm slowly converting all of my dormmates into dr.who fans.
<Spectrum> And Pizza Hut.
<Pyroh> Wow.....diamond dogs brains are so tiny....
<Combustiblelemons> meh i don't like pizza hut pizzas.
<Hybrid616> i've only read cupcakes, bittersweet and the first couple of chapters of progress...
<geosha> :)
<Zephirdd> RAWRity: Do it, believe me you won't regret :D
<Elky> RAWRity: don't read the last two chapters of 'Dangerous Business'
<Spectrum> GAH
<Spectrum> CUPCAKES
<^Twilight_Sparkle> hello there. just checking in
<Spectrum> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Sol> ~Yaay~
<Elky> they're awful
*Silverscreen 11gives Dermathil points for relating his answer to ponies
<Dermathil> also Silverscreen: my mom makes best pizzas
<Combustiblelemons> what elky said
<Flutteryay> Elky: I strongly disagree
<Spectrum> Ohey, dangerous business got updated
<R-Zack> Meh, Cupcakes isn't that bad.
<EspyLacopa> Home made pizza is awesome, because you have complete and total control over what goes on it.
<Bufurd> i will never eat cupcakes again because of this show
*Spectrum rushes to ED
<Elky> but everything before that is awesome
<Silverscreen> 11Dermathil: Homemade?
<DesertRose> Diamond dogs seem to be a crossbeed of moles and dogs
<R-Zack> Just don't read Sweet Apple Acres.
<R-Zack> Massacre.
<R-Zack> Ugh, TYPOS.
<Dermathil> yeah
<KanyeNorthEast> progress is great, but its going to lead to serious issues when luna shows up and doesn't live up to the fandoms "expectations"
<LunaTheForgotten> Homemade are pretty good.
<Silverscreen> 11epic
<Hybrid616> what does everyone think of bittersweet?
<Combustiblelemons> homemade pizzas? Tried to make my own, it tasted... soapy.
<RAWRity> ...how long does this go on?
<Flutteryay> I loved Bittersweet
<herospirit> I agree With Dermathil. Homemade = best
<R-Zack> Soapy?
<LunaTheForgotten> never read it.
<Sol> I prefer delivery to homebaked, personally
<Silverscreen> 11KanyeNorthEast: True dat
<KanyeNorthEast> sad story was sad...and a scrubs reference
<Combustiblelemons> I found out my roommate put soap into it whilst i wasn't looking.
<Hybrid616> eeyup
<mib_qa425j> digiorno
<Dash_With_Rainbows> actually i can beat both Pizza Hut and Dominos
<DibromYAY> WOOT
<EspyLacopa> Combustiblelemons: you trying for Worst Baker of Equestria title?
<Pyroh> Actually from the DNA samples my scientist have just recieved they contain multiple genes of Molerat, Dog AND Echidna

*Luna needs a bigger screen
<Dash_With_Rainbows> UK Bronies will most likely know of the place
<Luna> 07so much multi tasking

<a041744> Sister street fighter is about Kung fu nuns
<R-Zack> This can be considered, "Normal Chat Speed"
<Tim_Kangaroo> Like I said earlier, a friend of mine was Line Producer on Megas.
<Doctor_Scraps> I'm going to have to deduce that it's because Equestria itself is like separate dimsension from the rest of the MLP world, or each region has it's own Moon and Sun Bringers
<DSNesmith> huh, I don't think I've ever heard of this movie...
<Xaphan> 6I'm soooooooo waiting for the MLP episode!
<DSNesmith> it has gary oldman in it?!

<R-Zack> haha
<PrincessCelestia> oh snap its a hoe
<RobotPinkie> lol sklar :P
<ProfessorPonV> evolution comes from necesity
<DSNesmith> lol, best summary ever
<ValtheJean> I dunno...it's probably just me. But I really hate it when people do stuff like that. Like the "I'm logging off so I'll post in colors for the kick"
<Reaver21> Nittany_Tiger, I've had an entire theatre to me and my friends. Of course, I was with my girlfriend and her friends..and the things I did were..definitely on the "do not" list..
<Doctor_Scraps> I would actually call the Alicorns into question on that
<InsertCupcake> Ive run up and down the theatre with my friends cos we were the only ones there
<DSNesmith> he ain't a good guy so much as a bad motherfucker
<DesertRose> Pegasus, i would bet, are more like birds on the inside.
<Zorotokon> I've always imagined it as an expression of magic.
<Doctor_Scraps> And I've read a few Creation stories online that explain it better than I ever could
<General_Hazard> Girl = Chun Li
<everfrenights> this dude gives a distinkt "blueblood" vibe.
<MrChang> she gonna sleep with him
<prince-dari> Wrek: INB4 I ban Bjornfort with the message "Has just been revoked".

<interior_gummy> detroit, alabama?
<ProfessorPonV> who wants story time?
<General_Hazard> dat pie
<MrChang> ITS CREAM PIE
<MrChang> yummy
<Nittany_Tiger> Strangely, the theater was empty for a recent movie out on Halloween.
<Doctor_Scraps> According to one, the Pegasus were created by Luna because Celestia got so sad her crying created a thunderstorm, and the Pegasus cleared the clouds
<Silverscreen> 11Pie. Put some on your head! Tongue would beat your brains out getting to it.
<roushguy> Story Time?
<DSNesmith> hey look at that cleavage
<Reaver21> Kanyenortheast, I want some Apple Pie, too :D
<DSNesmith> I think it winked at me
<DesertRose> You know in a birds lungs, used air and fresh air are never mixed?
<interior_gummy> Comic book store clerk and film buff Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) watches a Sonny Chiba triple feature at a Detroit movie theater for his birthday. Here he meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), an attractive young woman. They go to a diner for pie after the theater and engage in flirtatious conversation before heading to Clarence's apartment. After
<sklar> i HOPE IT terracota pie
<Tovler> Tarentino = Pie made from human pinkies.
<Elky> just look at her facebook profile
<interior_gummy> After having sex, she tearfully confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarence's boss as a birthday present. She has fallen in love with Clarence and he with her.
<KanyeNorthEast> nobody in Detroit likes kung fu
<everfrenights> so whats our B movie for the night?
<a041744> Are you a robot?
<Combustiblelemons> I wouldn't expect anything less from a movie called true romance everfreeNights
<DesertRose> otherwise it would be impossible to get enough oxygen in the blood
<prince-dari> B movie is the rocky horror show.
<Wrek> 05lol
<ProfessorPonV> ok, im gonna say frack sience for a bit cuz i wanna tell my story
<DuskShine> You want this pie?
<DSNesmith> wait seriously
<Sol> Best B movie ever
<MrChang> this shit is like ghetto pretty woman
<General_Hazard> Burt Reynolds? Forget you girl
<DesertRose> because birds burn allot of oxygen
<everfrenights> oooooh, that sounds entertaining
<R-Zack> "You want this cake?"
<Tovler> My milk pie brings all the boys to the yard
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> my turn ons are..
<Zorotokon> Earth Ponies are fortified by magic in the physical sense. Unicorns and Pegasi are more squishy because their magic is either in their horns to be used, and with the Pegasi it is in their wings and hooves.
<DSNesmith> what boss hires a call girl for his employee's birthday
<Mongoose> I found some old comics
<DSNesmith> best boss ever

<Tim_Kangaroo> I had to switch to "High Quality"...
<Reaver21> So, he's a nerd?
<Elky> >swell
<Zorotokon> Alicorns don't come into the theory because they have are the logical conclusions or continiuosly throwing magic at a pony.
<everfrenights> ITS THE CUPAKES LAB, EVERYBODY RUN

<DuskShine> Confound these ponies, they drive me to bad sleeping schedules.

<Zorotokon> That's because you were spamming Banana.
<interior_gummy> Spazturtle: no
<KanyeNorthEast> talk about comics, girl totally wants to do you
<Sol> I thought Spider-Man one is Amazing Fantasy # 15?
<DSNesmith> all this movie needs now is some man-animals and needless slow-mo
<NefariousBanana> I was not spamming.
*DuskShine bucks Ziltoid in the gut.

<CrimsonFoxx> Yeah, it's like I told some hater on YouTube, this show has caused this much response on the Internet with only one season.

<Xiagu> I think you both are pretty equal, AJ
<[NLR]Lucid> Blooloo?
<Xeeshu> or remember me if i have forgotten you?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Cos without wings I'd say AJ. With? Rainbow, no contest. I don't see AJ breaking the sound barrier.
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> YAY
<Darf14> did he say scootaloo?
<Combustiblelemons> Scootaloo?
<R-Zack> Blootaloo?
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> happy music :3
<Uno> Elvis was right
<HaysforPonies> Haha, it is.
<Sockwear_Moon> Well. I can't see AJ with wings.
<Spectrum> Chicken.
<DSNesmith> scootablue
<Mason_Trowel> I would have to say Applebloom. I mean, c'mon, she went ziplining! :P
<KanyeNorthEast> elvis is always right
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> needs more xilophone
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> :3
<FlutterBro> me and Fluttershy are watching the stream on a huge tv!
<Combustiblelemons> >inb4 everyone else
<herospirit> Elvis is ALWAYS right
<Tovler> Blooregard Q. Kazoo
<Sockwear_Moon> So it would be a bit of an unfair comparison.
<VendorPony> I WANT TO FUCKING WATCH LION KING RIGHT NOW
<DSNesmith> Oh, Elvis, you're so omniscient
<_AppleJack_> Yeh, The Sonic Rainboom IS pretty cool.

<RobotPinkie> Cutest couple /)^3^(\
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> needs more
<Combustiblelemons> MANLY HUG
<InsertCupcake> i see whut you did thar
<CrimsonFoxx> ziplining isn't really athletic, it's just hanging from a rope while flying above the ground at high speed.
<DSNesmith> this music is hilarious
<Sockwear_Moon> But without wings, most likely AJ, Dash is a bit flimsy I'd imagine, in order to be able to fly in the first place.
<Silverscreen> 11lol, DSNesmith
<Reaver21> Tarzan music?
<R-Zack> Lol
<Darf14> happy music :)
<Apokalipse> STILL needs more flute

<Combustiblelemons> PEACHY
<Razyn> 0"Tasted like a peach"
<Darf14> err.....Incest much?
<[NLR]Lucid> Squick
<R-Zack> A PEACH?
<sotha> Is it alright that I want all of the main characters to die?
<Doctor_Scraps> Put the two of them in a bucking contest, and no contest at all
<_AppleJack_> Ya know it!
<Mason_Trowel> Don't forget sockwear, that sturdiness in this case is kind of objective, since it takes qomething pretty sturdy to be able to break the sound barrier. Light sure, but still sturdy.
<Uno> So they had a threeway?
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> nope :3
<DSNesmith> sotha, no
<InsertCupcake> yes sotha
<[NLR]Lucid> Yes Sotha, it is

*Charles waits for replies in his forum
<SuperBrony64> Okay, finally got it to work! Thanks
<Spectrum> dat music...again
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> alabama is lookin good
<Mason_Trowel> The mere fact her flesh doesn't peel off is a testament to her bodies strength in that regard.
<DSNesmith> Alabama's top doesn't look slutty enough
<[NLR]Lucid> dem tits
<Darf14> *dances to music*
<DSNesmith> alabama whirly
<RobotPinkie> Oh baby you KNOW what I like!
<DSNesmith> what a name
<CrimsonFoxx> She might have hollow bones...I once heard a theory in a Sonic fanfiction that Tails had hollow bones like birds to be able to fly, so the same theory could be applied to Dash.
<HaysforPonies> That's fanfic though.
<User_8611> About the Sonic Rainboom, I still think the one Dash pulled off when she was just a foal looked cooler than the one in the flight contest...
<Tovler> Have a swirly day!
<DerpHoovington> what's after this?
<CrimsonFoxx> Or Pegasi in general
<R-Zack> The Numbers, mason!?
<Xiagu> flying is magic
<SuperBrony64> He didn't get the letter I guess
<_AppleJack_> I've seen Princess Celestia raise the sun, but when Luna raises the moon, it's a beaut.
<[NLR]Lucid> One letter away from being a swirly. Or a whorly
<DSNesmith> this scene makes less sense than... the first half of the movie
<Darf14> http://static.gigwise.com/gallery/2559453_ElvisPresley-Pony.jpg
<CrimsonFoxx> And Hay, that's why I said it was a theory

<Razyn> 0Sol, too late
<[NLR]Lucid> Ya see that?
<Dudeguy> fair enough
<Sol> Ghosties already made one
<DSNesmith> slammed in the nose, fucks you all up!
<Darf14> at least they weren't brass knuckles
<Ghosties> 4There's this thing called the net, Razyn. You can find just about anything on there :P
<ValtheJean> so where were we on the dummy account position?
<DerpHoovington> interrogation scene go!
<SuperBrony64> SUCKER PUNCH
<HaysforPonies> M-mail. Magic mail.
<Ghosties> Well
<Razyn> 0Okie Dokie Lokie...
<FreezeFrame> I think everything in Equestria has some sort of magic
<Dark_Horst> see that? his namer's fist. he doesn't löike you. but man, you should meet his buddy, other fist, HE's fucking mad
<[NLR]Molestia> mib, are you sure you're connecting to .net?
<Sketchy_Sounds> D-Mail.
<Ghosties> Synros has said something
<[NLR]Lucid> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS INTERROGATORS, YAY!!
<DSNesmith> this movie is great
<Sockwear_Moon> I might be reciting fanon with magic flying pegasi, but it would explain away scientific debate.
<Ghosties> Razyn has not
<Sketchy_Sounds> Dragon-mail :D
<Synros> is DSNesmith spamming random things. Irelevent to whats going on
<Ghosties> I dunno
<R-Zack> :D
<Sol> Walken's scarf is so fabulous
<Ghosties> I don't want to exacerbate the situation too much
<Combustiblelemons> The mafia know everything somehow
<DSNesmith> so wait who is walken? besides the antichrist
<a041744> Like you can find MLP fans watching R rated movies on the net
<Synros> mt* nvm the "is"
<GraphiteLuck> Spike is essentially Twilights' Familiar it seems, besides, aren't dragons always magical in some way?
<mib_jq3szo> bronychat.net (173.236.147.3) port 6667
<CogWeaver> I almost want there to be a kind of twist to the story of the royal sisters, where it turns out that Luna was actually the oldest in the beginning and was jealous because it was her /younger/ sister who was getting all of the attention...it would make the whole banishment thing be brought into a whole new light, and it would still work with Celestia being oldest now because it's been 1000 years with Luna unable to ag
<CogWeaver> e being trapped inside the moon
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> :3
<[NLR]Molestia> bro
<KanyeNorthEast> he works for a mob boss
<[NLR]Molestia> you forgot leh irc.
<Ghosties> 4Made one what, Sol?
<HaysforPonies> Whenever magic and science are debated I keep thinking The Longest Journey, with a two worlds separated. One of magic and one of science.
<DSNesmith> came in the room blazin'
<CogWeaver> ...but now that I've said it, it probably won't happen
<[NLR]Molestia> irc.bronychat.net
<ValtheJean> yeah

<Sketchy_Sounds> CogWeaver!
<Combustiblelemons> Dumbass
<DSNesmith> yo sun, fuckhead that he is
<Sketchy_Sounds> I recently started playing that :D
<Uno> Who said he left it there earlier?
<a041744> What a derp
<DSNesmith> every line walken says is gold
<ValtheJean> understandable, though if we have nothing to go off of we aren't doing either of them a favor
<Elky> ^
<Sketchy_Sounds> Awesome game is awesome.
<_AppleJack_> When me and the girls were goin' to the mountain to get the dragon to sleep somewhere else, I don't know why we didn't bring Spike along, they could've talked, Dragon to dragon, but Fluttershy handled it.
<HaysforPonies> Haha, what a coincidence.
<[NLR]Lucid> Woulda gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling drivers license
<SuperBrony64> Found this plot summary of True Romance: "Clarence marries hooker Alabama, steals cocaine from her pimp, and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it."
<Darf14> wow, he is a really good actor. Its a shame his performance wasn't good in that movie.
<Ghosties> 4Fuck, I found the reference : /
<lordpie> lol
<VendorPony> I think he says more than JUST gold, DSNesmith

<Dark_Horst> fuckers frickn EVERYWHERE
<Tovler> Needs more Marimba music
<Ghosties> This is true
<Sockwear_Moon> I'm not sure the dragon would have listened to a 'baby' dragon.
<Sol> I'LL GET YOU YET
<Sol> BEARS
<Ghosties> But keep in mind that we're discussing stuff in Skype at the moment
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> o.o
<Mason_Trowel> I don't really think the dragon would have taken Spike seriously, considering Spike is just a baby/
<techdude300> >Forgets to put irc. at the beginning
<GraphiteLuck> I doubt it myself
<Elky> boo-beep
<CrimsonFoxx> AJ, didn't Twilight tell you about a certain incident with another dragon when Spike was being jealous of Owloysius?
<DSNesmith> skype noise
<DSNesmith> or something
<Zecora> hes so dead
<Sockwear_Moon> But I guess anything is better than flying in and bucking it in the face.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I was about to mention that one myself.
<Sol> OW
<Darf14> >_<
<Tovler> boo-blip is the new pink box

<Sol> >mon visage when dese films
<Luna> 07so just A + B movie

<Aristeo> But that's okay
<Pontang> It's powdered sugar.

<Combustiblelemons> DID SOMEONE SAY SPIDERMAN?
<^Twilight_Sparkle> I would if not for the 50-80% chance of it being a virus.
<RAWRity> Is this this prequel to the story of Dr. Roxo, the Rock and Roll Clown?
<Aristeo> I have bad people living near me too -- it happens
<everfreenights> I'm sure pinkie pie will buy.

<CrimsonFoxx> Meh, if it is a virus, AVG will stop it in its tracks
<Octavia> 13I think Razyn was one of the ones I didnt like. :/
<Uno> Strange how in the beginning Clarence needed to have people be payed to have sex.
<Darf14> Coke? If that is what you ask then here you go: http://www.infobarrel.com/media/image/37576.jpg

<VendorPony> I DID IT
<Ghosties> And we're mentioning it again tonight
<Xeeshu> that's allright Aristeo , we bad people are everywhere
<RAWRity> though that does make me wonder, what if there WAS a pony who was destined to be a stripper, or some other less-than-respected profession?
<DSNesmith> want an animal cracker?
<Xeeshu> :)
<Boegela> Rollercoasters fix evrything.
<DSNesmith> or... some crack?
<Sol> Animal crackers are BADASS
<Octavia> 13lol
<Aponymous> Drug deals on rollercoasters!
<Xeeshu> you dont worry my boy!
<R-Zack> you want an animal cracker?
<VendorPony> YOU KNOW WHAT I DID

<R-Zack> Or a banana?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Elliot Spitzer is involved with this? Next you'll be telling me Nixon is in on it too...
<ValtheJean> clearly that music has helped him significantly >.<
<LunaTheForgotten> What's happened in the movie so far

<Tovler> Stripper pony? Do they peep their skin off?
<everfreenights> BUISNESS DEALS ON ROLLERCOASTERS
<spaxio> or you can try to answare the questions
<Darf14> Drug dealing out in the open, nothing can go wrong
<Synros> we got a couple people posting picture that aren't revelant
<Luna> 07talk to them
<KShrike> I am SOOOOO not doing that marathon
<Sol> Bronies should meet up at an amusement park

<_AppleJack_> Well, I'm gonna leave, Bye everypony!
<KShrike> I have a life
<ValtheJean> hardly inappropriate though
<SuperBrony64> Roller Coaster time!
<Zephirdd> more like pole dancing pony, Tovler
<Xeeshu> What are you doing these days, Aristeo ?
<Doctor_Scraps> -is okay with this-
<[NLR]Molestia> ROLLER COASTER IS METAPHOR FOR CONVERSATION
<Tovler> Or are they tire strippers
<Ghosties> 4Serg? Sounds like a detergent
<RobotPinkie> Gonna be fun!
<Boegela> SECRET BUT FUN
<Ghosties> 4Sounds like a deterrrrrrrgent
<ValtheJean> that's like saying the pic of Applebloom getting her cutie mark of a can of glue is close to being gore
<[NLR]Molestia> I held a brony meetup at an amusement park. Jelly?
<RobotPinkie> Zerg? Sounds like a rush.
<Octavia> 13But would it honestly warrant anything? Maybe, maybe, a warning.
<Aristeo> Just college x.x
<Dash_With_Rainbows> Final destination imminent
<RAWRity> zephirdd of course, but it's still an interesting idea. There's so many ways this cute little show can be interpreted as a horrible world.
<Aristeo> And lots of it
<Aristeo> you?
<prince-dari> I wouldn't say any warning.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I am jelly...

<Sol> I'M KING OF THE WORLD
<Alumonius> 0Whenever I go on a rollercoaster and it goes for the drop, I almost always lift out of the seat

<Sol> Why yes, you do
<DSNesmith> "No, my ass tastes like peaches"
<CriticKitty> ...wut
<prince-dari> And that was just a comic, not really relevant, and I wouldn't warn for it, nor was I bothered by it, but according to our rules, I'd say Synros is right.
<VendorPony> I TOLD YOU BRO
<Xaphan> Crying in a rollercoaster.
<wolfinponysclothing> you do
<Dash_With_Rainbows> yes you do
<Darf14> Does he want to tell us something?

<wolfinponysclothing> gross*
<Ghosties> 4Here's how I see it, the rules state to not post any suggestive material...I think. We may have changed that particular bit in the rules, so if we did, then my point is moot
<Sol> Nice Sinatra
<a041744> Cool car phone bro
<R-Zack> Sunday.
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> you probably missed the intro
<Darf14> dang, the plot lost me
<CriticKitty> I have a wired phone in my car, bish.
<Tovler> Candlejack never instantly teleported people away in the cartoon.
<LunaTheForgotten> Dat phonebooth

<RobotPinkie> lol nope, RAWRity, I got picked for lottery once but that's when I was asleep :P
<prince-dari> I don't even see it as suggestive.
<ValtheJean> I wouldn't even say it's suggestive though
<DSNesmith> doctor Zhivago referencE?!
<Octavia> 13I didnt even get the joke at first.
<R-Zack> I have a rollercoaster creator for an Ad

<SirSprinkles> 6It really should be relevant to either the movie or the chat though.
<Octavia> 13I mean... its very vaguely suggestive, but com'on.
<LunaTheForgotten> Doctor Zhivago?
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: Yeah, that's what I said
<DSNesmith> my god I recognize 90% of the people in this movie
<VendorPony> Quiet, Bert
<RAWRity> why do I keep seeing Artie from WH13 in EVERY MOVIE EVER?
<Octavia> 13Relevant I can see.
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> road rage :3
<prince-dari> It's more that it's not relevant.

<Darf14> There is no middle finger big enough!
<Ghosties> 4Not suggestive? It has pole dancing and sex phone calls

<Aponymous> Clarence is so awesomely crazy.
<ShadTheCrazed> >:C
<Octavia> 13It has a phone with three x's. And a pony on a pole. But I'd hardly say they way its done was enough to warrant anything.

<Mongoose> Hey everyone
<SuperBrony64> What does it mean being uncut? It's a powder, how can it be cut?
<Octavia> Hello, everypony.

<ShadTheCrazed> Trust me, I know of a way.
<Ghosties> 4I wonder where Octavia's mind's at?
<Spin> Poor Mongoose
<KanyeNorthEast> i didn't know these cops liked shakespeare
<Octavia> 13;)
<Dark_Horst> uncut means concentrated
<Dark_Horst> pure shit
<prince-dari> SuperBrony64: Uncut as in pure
<Boegela> ooouw...a red tie..kinky
<Sol> Uncut is best
<PINJAS> it means its pure you noob
<Spin> Outshone by Octavia
<herospirit> "Fucking fuck fuck fucker fuck"
<R-Zack> This movie is so clean it should be rated E for everyone.
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> wut do cops do when they conviscate cocaine?
<RAWRity> superbrony it means it's pure cocaine, no filler or anythind added to it
<CrimsonFoxx> I'd go with Twilight's tough love method, just tie her to the computer chair, tape her eyelids open, and force her to watch the first episode.
<Zephirdd> omg prince-dari, u no mod, dun use colorz
<lordpie> : /
<okniwy> ore tanjou

<Lucid> wire*
<Spin> or Pinkamena.. do you have a basement?
<LunaTheForgotten> Blues Clues FTW
<Mongoose> And he's a mod
<Bjornfot> foreskin is da shiet
<Spectrum> also, are we going to get in the never ending penis argument here?
<ShadTheCrazed> I have a better idea.
<Combustiblelemons> Cut cocaine is as low as 10% purity
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> sniff it, of course. what else would you do with it
<SuperBrony64> So wait, wasn't he the producer? Is he an undercover cop?!
<Nightshade> wow they like to use the word fuck alot dont they
<Spectrum> Uncut>cut?
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> KIK
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> LOL
<Luna> 07did you find the first clue?
<DSNesmith> "I hate airports... they're so... airporty."
<herospirit> You missed a whole lot of people saying "fuck" Rainbow_Dash
<Sol> Meanwhile, back in Movie 1
<ShadTheCrazed> Introduce her to ponies via internet.
<Combustiblelemons> uncut cocaine can be up to 90& purity
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> if you snort cocaine and gunpowder do you explode?
<Darf14> At least its better than living near the train tracks
<Sumica> Cut is what you sell, pure can kill you
<Boegela> Cocaine: give it to the asians.
<PINJAS> pinkie pie is the biggest cocaine dealer in all of equestria
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> :3
<Rainbow_Dash> Oh, I think I will be just fine in that case
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> more happy music...
<Synros> <Bjornfot>: foreskin is da shiet
<Lucid> @Darf, no, it isn't.
<ShadTheCrazed> She has a youtube account. That's the most I can do for you.
<Sol> Dat music
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> after girl is beat up

<Boegela> and cofee
<Elky> pinkie pie couldn't deal coke, she'de just do it herself
<prince-dari> It just keeps coming back.
<RAWRity> pinjas Piknie Pie IS cocaine.
<HaysforPonies> Hey, Octavia.
<LunaTheForgotten> It's a bag of cocain. what does blue want to do with this?
<Spin> Just be careful where one wrong click in you're in a Clopping disaster
<Uno> I love this music
<Luna> 07yep

<Luna> 07the entire movie
<KanyeNorthEast> cut cocaine can kill you because its still cocaine

<Darf14> Lucid: Yeah your right
<Nittany_Tiger> Detroit's airport's actually pretty nice.
<Spectrum> Pinkie Pie bakes cocaine into her cupcakes.
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> xD
<Sol> Play this music in Clockwerk Orange
<SuperBrony64> The girl must really like that guy
<Tovler> crap, I'm lost (watches Thundercats)
<LunaTheForgotten> Better find the other clues first
<Sol> Do it
<DSNesmith> gunpowder plus cocaine... anyone else want to watch Lord of War suddenly?

<Boegela> ^^
<Reaver21> Dark_Horst, Fallout Equestria?
<ShadTheCrazed> I'll PM you her username. Just send a message to her giving an introduction to Bronies.
<ValtheJean> that's easy
<Lucid> Ouch
<ShadTheCrazed> But she rarely goes on her youtube account.
<ValtheJean> it's a shit fanfic, period
<RobotPinkie> Fuck it, he's high.
<Razyn> 0Sol, what?
<Dark_Horst> i mean, thinks of it! what a twilight could do with a handful of AA12'S
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> 0oh
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> 0those are cops
<ValtheJean> it's only popular because of the scare factor
<Quill1> oi sumica, sotha you there?
<CriticKitty> Well, he's dead
<sklar> Reaver21 what about FoE
<KanyeNorthEast> >he's so dead
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> best in the world at what they do
<DSNesmith> Eliot's screwed
<sotha> Yes Quill.
<SuperBrony64> What would Twilight need with AA batteries?
<Reaver21> Dark_Horst, I like the way you think :D
<Darf14> These are some badass cops
<Sol> Exactly
<prince-dari> It's funny.
<FlutterBro> Quick question: is Celestia > Notch?
<Spin> Hey if you hit a any bumps along the way I'll be happy to help
<ShadTheCrazed> So, I guess you're ready?
<prince-dari> The puns are really funny.
<R-Zack> Twilight would be decent with an AA12, since it has little recoil.
*Octavia 13still hasn't read Cupcakes
<Boegela> GET IN JAIL! LIKE A BOAS
<KanyeNorthEast> notch can't raise the sun...
<Quill1> and sumi? RESPOND MAN
<CrimsonFoxx> I'll message her in a few, I have to go help with something
<RAWRity> superbrony64 you DON'T want to know the answer to that question.
<Lucid> FlutterBro, they are the same entity
<prince-dari> I still say it's worth it for dem organ puns. :P
<Synros> magic runs on batteries Superbrony64
<ShadTheCrazed> CrimsonFoxx: Okay then.
<Combustiblelemons> Notch PROGRAMMED the sun and the moon
<Reaver21> Sklar, he mentioned Ponies and Combat Shotguns, and I thought of Velvet Remedy :D
<DSNesmith> ding ding
<somethingStuff> Twilight could use magic to hold any gun and not have to worry about recoil
<Combustiblelemons> and created an infinite world
<Octavia> 13Ew lol
<Combustiblelemons> therefore notch > celestia
<LunaTheForgotten> Dat hat
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... I guess I should try to introduce her to ponies myself using my social talent.
<Xaphan> Windows is True Romance. =D
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> 0shes already healed?
<Sol> DIS MUSIC
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> 0ELLIS hat
<FlutterBro> Okay then
<sklar> Reaver21 i get it now
<Bufurd> fucken music
<Mongoose> I love how we go through so much to recruite people
<Spectrum> twilight would have ridiculous accuracy
<Rainbow-derp> I'm Doctor Roxxo I do cocaine
<ShadTheCrazed> Once everyone else is gone.
<Boegela> hey dude, you got a head on your hat
<R-Zack> But she could only use that gun as much as her knowledge of knowing how to use it.
<Mongoose> All I do is
<Nightshade> k-k-k--k yeaaa
<DSNesmith> i love the inconspicuous pinkmobile
<Mongoose> "Hey You wanna watch this show?"

<R-Zack> She can't control the accuracy.
<Wrek> 05its ratehr short isnt it?
<Spectrum> she should use a colt/
<ProffesorKritzkrieg> 0hehe
<FlutterBro> I just have to mod Celestia into Minecraft and then Celestia > Notch
<Razyn> 0He's learning
<FlutterBro> somehow
<Xaphan> Those boobs... O.O
<Combustiblelemons> He's right
<Spectrum> just for irony
<SuperBrony64> I don't think Ponies can use guns…how would they reach the trigger?

<R-Zack> I would explain how most ponies would use guns, but I feel too lazy, and I'm watching a movie.
<somethingStuff> but fluttershy would never kill anything... I wonder how good rarity's aim is
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> yeah herospirit, I like it when she walks
<DSNesmith> OH WAIT I GET IT
<SuperBrony64> Is that the answer to every question Molestia?

<a041744> Ponies with guns? ponies don't need guns silly...
<Darf14> He knows everything
<ForeverOdin> I was surprised when I told my Mom I was a Brony that she instantly knew what I was talking about. She didn't care at all, and even got herself a Trixie shirt when I got my DJ P0N3 shirt ha. =)
<R-Zack> At least not in Equestria.

<R-Zack> Remember, there are modern soldier ponies than Equestia normal guard ponies.
<prince-dari> Apparently the original was terrible.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> these cops aint even mad
<ShadTheCrazed> Spin: You have a point.
