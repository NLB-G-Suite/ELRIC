<Sundaysmile> woulda thought they woulda pumped that 1k into commissioning a plush or something
<cowvarkian> unless you count using /me because that apparently is RPing to some mods >.>
<Chrysalis> and they promptly get dealt with
<Fisheh_Fish> Isn't there a room for RP?
*GilDash sticks tongue out at Chrysalis.

<cowvarkian> you know, full of major cities
<PONY> Dken2021, it's SUPER EFFECTIVE! I can't tell half of what's going on
<cachi01|mobile> PillowPoni why did i read stack of boobs?

<PONY> Dick Trixie.
<GilDash> One: I honestly have no idea what you're on about. :S
<Dken2021> listen to your governator
<ColtMagnum> tSparx: The energy needed to keep that thing in the air would scorch the Earth
<Aircrafter> RUSSIAAAA
<tSparx> ColtMagnum: not if magic
<PONY> Thus Trixie got her nickname: Great and Powerful
<ColtMagnum> tSparx: Space Magic?
<Michael> seems legit
<PillowPoni> cachi01|mobile: Because it said books
<tSparx> ColtMagnum: magic
<One> GilDash: :[ Yes you do.
<cowvarkian> hobokanonpok
<tSparx> ColtMagnum: and/or advanced physics beyond human understanding
<DerpyMuffins> What movie is this?
<GilDash> One: Seriously, I really don't. :D
<Dken2021> DerpyMuffins Independance day

<cowvarkian> boops?
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone have a good time converter
<Sumica> 00,10lets try and climb over the fireball
<Eli> ColtMagnum: the way those spaceships keep themself in the air, without visible energy output in any direction, i'm guessing they have something to nulifi gravity
<Fisheh_Fish> Bloops?
<PillowPoni> cachi01|mobile: Twilight loves books
<MaxTheBrony> what is 9pm est in Swedish time?
<MaxTheBrony> :s

<Lil_B> MaxTheBrony wait... 9pm est is now right?
<tSparx> cachi01|mobile: I'm pretty sure T-Sparx's sexuality isn't canon

<Michael> let us watch tv
<Sundaysmile> must....see.....tvvvvv.....
<Eli> ColtMagnum: i'm not sure about that. if you told someone 500 years ago that we would have TVs, they would have said it's impossible too
<Canadian_Brony> PONY WHY ARE THERE VAMPIRES IN TWILIGHT SPARKLE?
<tSparx> cachi01|mobile: But if I were gonna guess about the creators' thoughts, if they have any, I'd not that Pink, Purple, and blue is the color of a commonly used (some would say "the') bisexual flag
<Dken2021> man, these tvs have a bad reception
<tSparx> I'd note*
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat voice
<Ninjazz> I'm only waiting for will Smith.
<Lil_B> MaxTheBrony ah... than forget what I just told you about the time -.- I though we were talking about right now
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<alexxm> how many cigars does he smoke
<ColtMagnum> Eli: If Friendship is Magic, and Magic is sufficiently advanced technology, then does that mean Friendship is sufficiently advanced technology?
<Fisheh_Fish> Wasn't this song in Pulp Fiction?
<PONY> Still better lovestory than Twilight
<Spectator> Independance day. Hi, everypony.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: What's so important about Will Smith? :S
<MaxTheBrony> Lil_B Ah :d

<Dken2021> allo Spectator
<Ninjazz> GilDash, he's my favorite black guy.
<cowvarkian> gildash sortof main character
<tSparx> Eli Unless it really is impossible.

<Dovah> PONY: think of edward in twilight now look at this picture of a real vampire http://tinyurl.com/9pvb7z4 who will win?
<PONY> NO! Not the BEER!
<Fisheh_Fish> Rumble!
<tSparx> GilDash: What's possibly *unimportant* about Will Smith?
<Fisheh_Fish> MICHEAL MOORE
<Michael> omg

<alexxm> michael moore will kill us all
<ColtMagnum> tSparx: Will Smith is the person you want to be standing beside during an alien invasion. Mark my words.
<GilDash> tSparx: Look, I was just saying, that's all! :S
<Michael> someone make thor mad
<tSparx> :P you two
*Fisheh_Fish marks ColtMagnum 's words
<PONY> Dovah: that ain't no real vampire, this is real vampire; http://mlpf.im/1ij
<Fisheh_Fish> WILL SMITH!
<Spriggals> Fresh prince
<Dken2021> and here's the reason why we came for this movie
<cowvarkian> so, its a 15 mile long ship... that can cover an entire city?
<tSparx> Haha, GilDash, just like my namesake, when I get angry, you'll frikkin' know, lol
<Eli> PONY: Nosferatu!
<Fisheh_Fish> <3 Will Smith
<ColtMagnum> This is a story all about how, my life got turned fliped upside down
<Canadian_Brony> four score and seven-HOLY CRAP!!
<GilDash> tSparx: ... Okay? :S
<PONY> So... what do the aliens have so much against USA? and mostly... USA only?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Equestria Model Contest - Submissions and Winners!
<DaringDerpy> no, they are everywhere
<cowvarkian> its the entire world
<tSparx> PONY I think they're just focusing on the USA perspective, they're all over
<Fisheh_Fish> I dunno PONY , why do the terrorists?
<tSparx> I think they started elsewhere, actually
<DaringDerpy> but...the president of the usa saves the world. personally
<tSparx> Fisheh_Fish: They don't. Just ask London
<Fisheh_Fish> I shall
<cowvarkian> and spain
<cowvarkian> and the rest of the world
<ColtMagnum> PONY: Its hapening all over the world, the movie is just set in the USA because everybody else expect the U.S. to police the world
<meeps> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-google-search-twilight-vampire.jpg
<PONY> Fisheh_Fish, I'm pretty sure terrorists were against everyone, until US started provoking them.
<PillowPoni> PONY: In District 9 the aliens stopped over Johannesburg
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Well, hey, where did this movie get made? Whose independence day did this movie happen in?
<Dovah> PONY: a real vampire is something that is undead, sucks blood and scares the living hell out of you, not somthing that fills the first 2 requirements and replaces the third with "kills you cuz they look so rediculous"
<Ninjazz> Kinda scary.
<Michael> giant ovni!
<Lil_B> FUN FACT: this movie was directed by a german
<PillowPoni> inb4 MichaelBayplosion
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<ColtMagnum> Lil_B: steven spielberg is german?
<tSparx> Lil_B: O ja!
<sonicandmario85> ITS A GIANT UFO
<cowvarkian> so, how high above the cities are these things?
<Michael> it's only a model
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat pileup
<Dken2021> shhhh
<Sumica> 00,10is this the bit whre the hot lizzard chick shows up on a bigscreen on the underside and says we come in peace?
<Lil_B> ColtMagnum nope, director was Robert Emmerich
<cowvarkian> because if they're only 15 miles in diameter....
<ColtMagnum> cowvarkian: r u from bioware?
<PONY> Fun Fact; stuff always happening in US is because Hollywood is in US
<cowvarkian> sure ColtMagnum
<tSparx> cowarkian I believe they said these were 15mi wide, so you do that math.
<DaringDerpy> we come in peace! ack ack ack!

<MLP_Brovakiin> Sorry
<Canadian_Brony> k

<ColtMagnum> Fisheh_Fish: This is where Christian Bale got his inspiration for Batman
<Dken2021> I've only hear this guy voice burly or manly women
<DaringDerpy> they need 6 hours for this?
<Sumica> 00,10So how did the tv's do that? across so many networks?

<Obsidian> dat lawyer joke
<Michael> amurica!
<tSparx> Bacon[Hazard]: Pot is nowhere near that hard on your throat. I know an old dude's smoked pot every day for the last 40 years, and he doesn't sound great, but not *that* bad
<cowvarkian> mitt romney?
<Fisheh_Fish> Nope

<ColtMagnum> Canadian_Brony: tbh, if an alien race wanted to invade us, theyd win
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol DaringDerpy That reminds me of that boondocks episode XD
<Lil_B> I wanna know what the internet was thinking during the Alien Attack
<Bacon[Hazard]> tSparx:Thanks for the correction. I'm not really that good on drugs, but I know what a smoker sounds like.
<PONY> g&p
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Canadian_Brony> dat orderly fashion
<Fisheh_Fish> TPB
<Michael> Lil_B: commenting how will look the aliens?
<DaringDerpy> the internet would spout stupid forced memes
<Bacon[Hazard]> "Do not panic!"
<PONY> Great and Powerful
<Sundaysmile> dem fender benders
<tSparx> Bacon[Hazard]: Just trying to set the record straight. Plenty of misinformation about pot and other drugs, both too good and too bad
<PillowPoni> Oh is this the MichaelBayplosion part?
<ColtMagnum> Bacon[Hazard]: eeyup.

<sonicandmario85> ColtMagnum:no its just a giant UFO
<Bacon[Hazard]> tSparx: Sorry if I offended.
<Dken2021> that's what all alien invaders do
<DaringDerpy> 90 billion? the universe is not that old
<alexxm> foreshadowing
<Fisheh_Fish> sonicandmario85: Nope, it's smog
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol too late
<Canadian_Brony> ColtMagnum true. If a super-intellegent race has the ability to travel across billions of light years and they wanted to invade us, they would invade us and easily win.
<tSparx> Bacon[Hazard]: Nah nah! NOt at all!
<Bacon[Hazard]> Give the kid the hand grenades... "This is why we can't have nice things!"
<Lil_B> I like all the Michael bay Explosion Jokes... some people haven't seen anough Roland Emmerich Movie to know that his desasters are way larger in scale XD
<Fl00tersh41> 90 billion light years? wouldn't that be the far side of the universe? Litterally
<PONY> DaringDerpy: true, it's 6000 years <_<
<Canadian_Brony> There is no competition.
<tSparx> Alright, hate to leave early, but must get ready. Ausgehe!
<ColtMagnum> Canadian_Brony: Its kinda wierd it hasnt happened already. Seeing our planet has a crapton of water.

<Michael> Canadian_Brony: i think if they have suck tech, they are pacific, ¿why? because proguess is only with peace and comprension
<PONY> DaringDerpy: Oh right
<Fl00tersh41> Riots? Looks like a normal day in the bronx
<cowvarkian> ColtMagnum: but fusion is sorta shitty for space travelers
<Obsidian> This isn't a riot, its a THursday
<Bacon[Hazard]> Hell yes.
<ColtMagnum> cowvarkian: or Fission. Not sure which one but its the energysource of an artificial sun
<cowvarkian> fission
<cowvarkian> dat nellis
<flutter_spin> lol
<Canadian_Brony> ColtMagnum yeah, but our telescopes haven't found any planets that can support life. If we can't see them, they probably aren't coming.
<DaringDerpy> wiki says the edge of the observable universe is 46bln lightyears away
<Dken2021> welp, he's dead

<sonicandmario85> Canadian_Brony:yes they do
<ColtMagnum> Canadian_Brony: Thats more because of our technology compared to whats actually out there
<sonicandmario85> Canadian_Brony:universe is full of suprises
<cowvarkian> no, I know we havent found in, with the planets we have discovered, but how does that mean that none exist?
<Michael> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> The universe is near endless. There will always be possibilities.
<Fisheh_Fish> Crazy guy is best guy

<GilDash> Ninjazz: You're making it hard for me to stay here. :D
<Fisheh_Fish> XD
<Lil_B> ok, basicly: the universe is 46bln years old, so we can only see the parts of the Universe that are within 46bln light years because the light from the other parts hasn't even reached us yet
<cowvarkian> oh, yeah
<Canadian_Brony> stupid internet

<PONY> GilDash, it appears so, but how illogical is it to just come around to destroy? instead of conquer or what ever else.
<Franek12354> IS OP
<Michael> they have hax
<Michael> as always
<GilDash> PONY: Destroying is conquering! Look it up! XD
<PONY> GilDash, I mean, I'm pretty sure that laser would have been as effective all the way from space as well

<Ninjazz> Canadian_Brony, you're a muffin terrorist, you know that?
*Canadian_Brony throws a burnt muffin at Fisheh_Fish
<Fisheh_Fish> flutter_spin: Me too
<MLP_Brovakiin> thats what she said
<Michael> omg
<PONY> you sure it's a suit, doc?
<sub06905> :D
<Eli> tSparx: if aliens attack, they don't have the time to sweettalk the whole nation, like hitler did...
<Michael> ewwwwwww
<Sundaysmile> so many puns
<Fisheh_Fish> Icky is a scientific term
<Canadian_Brony> eugh, Arby's
<Fisheh_Fish> This part scared the shit out of me o.o
<Rex_Mundi> flutter_spin- dats right, im loving the fact that there are some japanese people getting into MLP, its like a reverse anime situation going on. what with its usually us talking about their shows, now we have a show they are talking about. its neet.
<Michael> oh god he's alive!
<Lil_B> tSparx everyone can do that, all you need is organisation and a good transport systhem (and today, germany CAN't do that anymore, our Military is really ... not as good anymore... well, it's still cheap I guess)
<Sundaysmile> no data no!
<Fisheh_Fish> IT'S ALIVE!
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: IKR? Awesome.
<Ninjazz> Oh boi.
<PONY> suit... with tentacles
<Obsidian> Hentai time
<Canadian_Brony> WTF?!?!?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: No Pain, No Gain // Pinkies Cakes // The Sky's The Limit //
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat rape
<tSparx> Eli: But that's not what I'm talking about. It's not the sweet-talking, it's nt even Hitler himself. The Nazi party took some farmers, gave them shovels, trained them in secret, and in a few months were marching on Poland. Now, not for good reasons, but that's still very impressive.
<GilDash> PONY: Can you see where this is going?
<PONY> Natürlich
<Fisheh_Fish> I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
<Canadian_Brony> Ding!
<Sundaysmile> happy tentacle fun time?

<Fisheh_Fish> This part
<Obsidian> Thank god we didn't send any japanese school girls in there
<flutter_spin> That part scared me too
<Michael> lol
<Fisheh_Fish> x'D
<PONY> eyyup
<Michael> dem tentacles
<Fisheh_Fish> Dat alien
<Canadian_Brony> okay, now this is just cheesy
<Lil_B> tSparx the soldiers were quite trained already, and nothing was done in secret
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome- It is indeed, they seem to like AJ a lot it seems, AJ is appearently the most popular pony in japan. Shes an ikemen onee-san.
<Fisheh_Fish> Dem cliches
<PONY> I like the tape idea
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which side would the aliens get?
<Michael> aliens are made to be bad?
<Sundaysmile> kisssssssssssss
<Fisheh_Fish> Kiiiisssss
<flutter_spin> Well, I'm not sure they get a lot of country gals in Japan
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Yes! It's interesting if AJ would be the most popular pony in Japan.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord the American side
<Canadian_Brony> why wasn't that glass bullet proof?
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - who said we'd slice it vertically?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would give them the southern hemisphere.

<Fisheh_Fish> Color me bad....?
<flutter_spin> No seriously. If you have the talent, MUST you use it?
<AJIsAwesome> ColtMagnum: Ikemen stands for a man that is handsome and attractive. Onee-san is a way to indicate that the person you're talking to is a woman.
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: because they were above America territory
<ColtMagnum> AJIsAwesome: so Aj is a masculine woman to Japan?
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: and still are

<flutter_spin> Kid of me wants to say "Who wants to play a game?"
<MLP_Brovakiin> I think rifftrax should parody a MLP episode :D
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: :D
<Fisheh_Fish> MLP_Brovakiin: Oh god XD
<Michael> O_o
<sub06905> :D
<Canadian_Brony> Kid of me wants to watch ponies. Adult of me wants to watch ponies.
<flutter_spin> There are people out there who HAVE done rifftrax commentaries to episodes

<Chrysalis> tell me if you see any good ones
<Rex_Mundi> AJisAwsome- hmmm, AJ seems to get more praise than the other ponies, they like the other ponies alot but its AJ that gets most of the praise.
<Reikim|Editing> When a story ends, you may be saddened that it is over; but that is when you pick up a new book and crack it open.

<Reikim> What are we talking about here? Fear of people?
<Fisheh_Fish> Haha! Time for Ponies!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm glad there's help for that, but I should never have a fear of that in the first place. It makes no sense.
<VioletLynnScraton> :)
<Pixel> Dat music that makes you fall asleep
<VioletLynnScraton> DEM PONIES
<VioletLynnScraton> EP1C
<VioletLynnScraton> :)
<RaveBrony> A fear i have is a fear of driving.... talk about a Huge hinder on my life...
<Star_Shadow> Hi violetLynnScraton
<Canadian_Brony> Pixel no wonder I've been yawning for the past minute
<Shizuka> 13so much complaining about stream
<name> you should do doctor whooves and assistant
<loGaN> Canadian_Brony: http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/Goody_23/poop.jpg
<Shizuka> 13why can't you just be happy there is a stream at all
<VioletLynnScraton> Star_Shadow: Hello.
<JESmith71> Barbetos: Actually though the reason this ran late was because Shizuka had trouble streaming at the start, so we had to wait an hour and a half for Nittany to come back on
<Reikim> See, that one at least makes sense.
<flutter_spin> complaining? who's complaining?
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, who's complaining?
*Chrysalis hugs Shizuka
<Fisheh_Fish> Shizuka: I loved the stream
<JESmith71> Oh I am happy
<Pixel> ETT MOOVED
<Kandarihu> This EMN only ran long because Shizuka's internet got stuck in "Dialup-esque upstream" mode.
<RaveBrony> Sure if i have to go somewhere, ill just do what has to be done, but otherwise i hate it.
<somepony_else> i'm not complaining
<loGaN> Shizuka: complain complain
<sub06905> i believe everyone wants MLP Live
<Quick_Thinker> the title credits were trying to kidnap RD :(
<Canadian_Brony> loGaN that was disgusting and you should feel bad.
<VioletLynnScraton> don don do-dod-don-do
<Major> Shizuka: I like it when the mods stream :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aw shirt
<Rex_Mundi> im in love with ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLP Live?
<Reikim> Think about what driving entails, and realize that you are right to be afraid.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Disussion: Your Top Pony List!
<flutter_spin> Well does it help that I watch your channel Shiz?
<VioletLynnScraton> Major: PONIES ARE BETTER

<Canadian_Brony> EVERYPONY STOP COMPLAINING NAO
<VioletLynnScraton> But anything but G3.5
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, beware. Some of us can withstand G3
*sub06905 prefers MLP Live
<RaveBrony> Yeah.... true...
<Quick_Thinker> Shizuka: The movie was not my most top 10 but the sream was superb with the rift and the chat
<loGaN> Canadian_Brony: i know i SHOULD feel bad but im laughing my as* off right now
<Rex_Mundi> G3 ponies please, let us make fun of them! I will be fun!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nah. I won't deviate from the schedule.
<Star_Shadow> G3.5 is the devil's spawn
<VioletLynnScraton> True
<JESmith71> Given I have my own internet trouble I never complain about the stream, because most of the stream issues I have are probably on my end, not you guys
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doesn't mean I can't show it after the next ep. >:)
<Pixel> Dem overly long credits
<VioletLynnScraton> :L

<Star_Shadow> G3 isn't to bad, I grew up with it. And it has minty.
<Pixel> G3.5 is Hellspawn
<Agrold> G3.6 is better IMO :)
<AJIsAwesome> Pixel: Isn't that 3.6?
<Applejack2012> I love G3
<VioletLynnScraton> Music after Movie, Y U NO PLEASE VINYL?
<Fisheh_Fish> G3.65?
<Kandarihu> Our exposure to G3.x is like the Zentradi being exposed to Earth Culture. Those of us who have been subjected to it won't be paralyzed by it again.
<Rex_Mundi> Minty should get a g4 version.
<Star_Shadow> Long cridits
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/2467.png

<Fisheh_Fish> Pixel: Carbon is best breakfast food

<RaveBrony> My fam has already partially given up on my older bro (since he just complains about moving to NY), so all the pressure gets forced on me x_x
<Quick_Thinker> well yes a personal preference is possible its just parents influence thier kids more then most things
<otakon> thanks
<Kandarihu> Remember guys, Sweetie Bell is a pony, not a robot.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Burnt food isn't that bad. But when it's too burnt or you get cancer, fuck.

<Dark92Enigma> TOGETHER FOREVER
<cachi01|mobile> All your bits are belong to us
<AJIsAwesome> Forgottencrow: :S
<Ponies47> Voice craxk! DRINK!
<VioletLynnScraton> Idea!!

<Dark92Enigma> IDEAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Kandarihu> Forgottencrow, are you 2 hours behind the rest of us?
<sub06905> your*
<Reikim> Funny, I find highway driving oddly relaxing.
<Forgottencrow> :D
<PONY> wine
<cachi01|mobile> Beer
<Fisheh_Fish> Voice crack
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Eli> ah, as much as i like that episode, i'm tired. good night guys
<VioletLynnScraton> yeah, more like wine
<MaxTheBrony> :d
<Dark92Enigma> WINE
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Night!
<Obsidian> Night Eli
<twilight_sprinkle> KILL HER
<Fisheh_Fish> Later Eli
<RaveBrony> Really??
<alexxm> fashion police exsit?
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<MaxTheBrony> Night Eli :)
<Dark92Enigma> DED
<Rainbow_Glasses> tacky
<twilight_sprinkle> and then she drowned her
<Azuredragon> She made those dresses so fast, yet she took so long on the gala dresses
<cachi01|mobile> Night Eli :)
<Reikim> Yeah.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: If it ferments.
<VioletLynnScraton> ALCHOHOL?! IN A TV SHOW?
<Kandarihu> alexxm, no more than in real life.
<RaveBrony> Interstate driving is the Worst for me! x_x
<VioletLynnScraton> : O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One day, I decided to take the interstate, and I found out that none of the things I was worried about happening were ever going to happen.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: True that.
<AJIsAwesome> VioletLynnScraton: If it ferments.
<cachi01|mobile> Alcohol ftw??
<Franek12354> Dat voice
<cowvarkian> sure
<Obsidian> Opal is not amused
<Reikim> 40km/h is rather boring but simple. 50 is all right. 60 gets nerve-wracking. 80-100 is oddly comforting.
<VioletLynnScraton> AJIsAwesome: maybe
<Fisheh_Fish> cachi01|mobile: Alcohol FTW
<Kencolt> This is Rarity's revenge for those claws.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And now interstate driving is nothing to me.
<alexxm> Obsidian whats new

<Ponies47> sub06905: Well I was raging at his brat of a son. He got angry after I salmmed my bedroom door. He kicked my door open thus it hitting my wall so hard it and made a hole in it. He'll fix it and he's going to repaint my room :3

<Rainbow_Glasses> someone get the sofa
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since traffic is so organized on the interstate.

<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Eeyup
<Ponies47> cachi01|mobile: He kicked my bedroom door so hard it swinged right into the wall thus making the hole in the wall
<MaxTheBrony> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> awkwaaaard

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They need to learn to catch the next exit.
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: o.o didnt know they did that
<Reikim> Really, though.
<Azuredragon> damnit Rarity
<Ponies47> cachi01|mobile: He's fixing it. Plus he's goign to repaint my bedroom as well. :3
<Reikim> The worst part of driving is parking lots.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though that's harder on turnpikes.
<cachi01|mobile> VioletLynnScraton it feels more like a uhmmm soul calibur lol
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Not to butt in, but have you talked to your mother about this?

<cowvarkian> its a cartoon
<Franek12354> best comparison
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I was talking about the moment when Sweetie Bell said she wanted AJ to be her sister.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: She was there when it happened
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've vote traffic lights, but you need those.
<Reikim> I hope that, on Judgement Day, God has the sense to turn all of the parking lots into the flaming hellholes they are.
<Kandarihu> PsychoticDoc, how so?
<VioletLynnScraton> Franek12354: TRUE.
<MaxTheBrony> When what happend?
<creeperhugger10> acs?
<PsychoticDoc> Kandarihu: ask jappleack

<Barbetos> And if you say that you do, then it has worked.
<DaringDerpy> wikipedia: Despotism is a form of goverment in which a single entity rules with absolute power. That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group,[1] as in an oligarchy. The word despotism means to "rule in the fashion of a despot" and does not necessarily require a singular "despot", an individual.

<otakon> it's only a perstistent is all
<Quick_Thinker> thats a toughie in my opinion
<MaxTheBrony> massive isnt it?
<Barbetos> DayZ a few years back, yes, today? No.
<AJIsAwesome> *I still*
<flutter_spin> "endgame"
<MirrorImage> character progression would imply an RPG - wouldn't an MMO just refer to scale and the fact that it's "multiplayer"?
<Quick_Thinker> plus its not even a "game" its a mod
<AdamTheDuck> Is The Secret World any good?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Minecraft could technically be an MMO.
<aquadangoRD> ad
<Ponies47> I still have a Gamecube laying around here somewhere
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<aquadangoRD> me too
<DerpDash> i have 2 for some reason
<AJIsAwesome> Me too.:D
<aquadangoRD> wierd
<flutter_spin> Isn't Secret World becoming f2p too?
<Spectrum_Rush> Allegr0: DayZ can be classified as an Massively Multiplayer Sandbox Survival game
<Quick_Thinker> progression in ARMA 2
<Quick_Thinker> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<DerpDash> i think it might have been a pregnant gamecube?
<MaxTheBrony> :P

<CK|GW2> flutter_spin: It most likely will need to. It's not doing well enough to keep its current model, especially since they never advertised ever.
<DerpyMuffins> Night Star_Shadow
<Obsidian> Flootahshy: It is live
<Silverscreen> 1,11I have all the oldschool games as emulators on my comp.

<CiderIsForDrinking> stepstep
<cachi01|mobile> Shitstep
<LunarSS> speedcore
<linsett> What did I miss?
<CK|GW2> flutter_spin: They didn't get good ratings, either. Their MetaCritic is somewhat weaker than normal, and their lack of advertisement killed them too
<Silverscreen> 1,11otakon: Me to. Dolphin and Virtual boy are my friends.
<MadSurge> There's also MODERN classical music!
<DerpyMuffins> Allegr0 We still love Octavia and she plays Classical music

<MaxTheBrony> xD
<cachi01|mobile> I used to play the karateka game for atari lol
<Quick_Thinker> well Allegr0 i would consider it an MMO but since its not even a Game its just a MOD it kind of loses that title to me
<cachi01|mobile> Or was it for nes?
<CK|GW2> flutter_spin: The problem is, you can't hope to beat WoW by giving people another WoW. TSW is essentially a hybrid of WoW questing and GW2 combat....so if you wanted GW2 you would just get GW2, and if you were playing WoW you'd keep doing that. >_>
<cachi01|mobile> I think it was for nes
<Derpy_Hooves> Silverscreen: WHY are you silver, and why are tyou a screen? :I

<flutter_spin> they just started. They aren't lookin' right now
<Kandarihu> It's hard to remember every MMO I've played. It's been a lot.
<Quick_Thinker> for instance the ending to Breakdown was bad but the experenice i havd while playing it was freakin awesome i remember getting the ULTRA ACELLERATOR
<FillyFlam> There we go. Now I need to print off a picture of the mips logo to put on my dartboard.
<cachi01|mobile> I remember a weird medieval mmo
<flutter_spin> That voice is making me fall asleep
<Silverscreen> 1,11I agree. In fact, most games now continue after the ending sequence so you can keep playing.
<Phase4> 00,02i played about an hour of eve online

<XylemTube> Gigabit Harmony played EvE? Awesome

<Silverscreen> 1,11For some reason, cheezburger.com freezes my computer.
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: is second life a good game? cuz i know they made a ponyville map for it

<Phase4> 00,02400MHz pentiun 2 FTW!!!
<Zephyr> reason i ask is I'm thinking of getting it, though i never played GW1. I figure since there's no sub theres little to lose
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: so other than talking with people theres nothing to do?
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Thrackerzod> PillowPoni theres more free games arround silly :P
*Ponies47 Doesn't have Sims 3 but has Sims 2 and TONS of add-on packs for Sims 2

<Kandarihu> Phase4, Gundam is one of the most iconic mecha series in history. The original 0079 series was the first of the Real Robot subgenre
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that got canceled
<AdamTheDuck> :'(
<MaxTheBrony> Thank god for that
<MaxTheBrony> Alien turtles
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<Silverscreen> 1,11Thunder Cats MMO
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ooh
<Kandarihu> Actually no. Bar none, Gundam IS the most iconic mecha series.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Persona MMO
<Pikachu> i feel alone on minecraft :(
<Quick_Thinker> Hasbro MMO?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, ah
<Dken2021> SaxyPretender for reals? aww, I wanted to see how bay would handle that
<Dovah> Pikachu: I am playing minecraft :(
<Quick_Thinker> all of Hasbro IP in a big MMO
<AJIsAwesome> Custom Robo MMO?
<MadSurge> :D "Oh golly"
<flutter_spin> They cancelled the Star Trek (DS9) MMO reboot
<Quick_Thinker> meaning GI joe and Transformer and MLP
<LadyCanary> YES SAXY.
<Pikachu> Dovah: like im on my minecraft but my plugins dont work and i may bore u with my 50 firework shoots
<FlyingShoppingCart> Playing FPS games with a drawing tablet is like playing Tetris with a Steering Wheel...

<Dovah> Pikachu: huh?
<Dken2021> a Tetris MMO?
<MaxTheBrony> What theme?
<Phase4> 00,02IRC the MMO

<MaxTheBrony> Ah

<Quick_Thinker> i like Rainbowcrashs88 Twilights theme more
<Buytoast> who's guching over the rainbow bitch now?
<Kandarihu> The problem with a Gundam MMO would be the same problem as these Star Wars MMOs. Everyone in the Star Wars MMOs wants to be a Sith Lord or a Jedi. If there were a Gundam MMO, everyone would want to be a Newtype
<Buytoast> gushing*
<Dovah> Pikachu: ah i'm too lazy to download mods LP

<CK|GW2> Bonus points if it has Midna in it.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Pokemon MMO would be best MMO. :P

<DerpyMuffins> Allegr0 Derpy MMO?
<cachi01|mobile> Yay
<Phase4> 00,02it would be pokemon

<Buytoast> don't bother getting Guild Wars 2 thinker
<Buytoast> just another pice of shit for the pile
<Kandarihu> The thing is, the point of the fairies in TOoT is that all of the Kokiri children had a companion fairy. Link was the one exception because he was a Hylian living under a mistaken ethnicity.
<sub06905> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: did you like the 3D pokemon games like XD and Colosseum?
<PillowPoni> Damn you laptops, y u die on me. Better question, why do computers hate me?

<HoodyNinja> ^
<Dken2021> yo wa shock!
<HoodyNinja> What AJIsAwesome said ^
<Quick_Thinker> I Wanted that so badly AJI
<CK|GW2> The GW2 devs are apparently working on a system whereby you can visit other servers so you can play with friends, IIRC, I think they called it "ghosting" or sommat.
<flutter_spin> but your camera will be way up in the sky. You see everything. :P
<Silverscreen> 1,11AJIsAwesome: That's why I like playing as Pokemon in Super Smash Brothers.
<Yahooz> rawr
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: they had to actually reverse-engineer the game mechanics for pokemon when they wanted to make pokemon stadium, tunrs out no one through to write it down

<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: :'(
<CiderIsForDrinking> If my computer keeps getting a massive CPU i'm going to lose my mind and go Incredible Hulk on it.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I think the firs tthing they need to do is make the Pokemon games for the Wii. full 3d, being able to throw a pokeball with the wiimote and stuff...it'd be cool.
<MaxTheBrony> Aw Allegr0 you are playing On Usa servers :S?

<TheWalrusCancer> I do.
<MASF123> They're gonna go bankrupt.
<Silverscreen> 1,11My favorite genre shifts depending on my mood. Same with my game. As for Consoles, I don't have a favorite console. The console doesn't matter, because I focus on the games.

<Buytoast> but about origin yes
<HoodyNinja> My first game was Mario Party 2
<Quick_Thinker> first game MARIO 64

<sub06905> Best game is: Overhyped Sellout Lens Flare Dubstep War Zombies 4 HD
<flutter_spin> what? Dreamcast? really?
<LadyCanary> :D DREAMCAST.
<CK|GW2> Buytoast: If you're not trolling then you're stupid, because you're actually lying about the way a game works just to degrade it. So I'm presuming the better of the two, really. :p
<MirrorImage> TI-83 for best console!

<CrimsonPhoenix> TheWalrusCancer, I remember streaming that

<LadyCanary> MOTHAFUCKIN PROJECT JUSTICE
<Kandarihu> Rumor has it that EA refusing to publish games on the Dreamcast killed it.
<TheWalrusCancer> PC or consoles?
<Buytoast> now you're not even trying to prove me wrong

<MASF123> N64
<Silverscreen> 1,11I don't have a favorite console. The console doesn't f**king matter. The games are what matter. Especially in this day and age where almost all the platforms have the same graphics and control layout.

<TheWalrusCancer> Yes, yes you can!
<AJIsAwesome> I rented a Sega Dreamcast, but we got a buggy Sonic Adventure. I glitched into so many things.:D
<sub06905> PC
<MadSurge> MASF123: fuck them, Tetris is an asexual game
<Kandarihu> And this is before (or perhaps part of the reason why) EA became so corrupt.
<CK|GW2> Buytoast: I don't have to prove you wrong. You made the claim and I asked you earlier to substantiate it with evidence. You refused.
<Buytoast> how does the shit taste there CK?
<Dken2021> I wish I could play my dreamcast, but I don't have a/v cables
<MASF123> Lol.
<Buytoast> because you're eating it up

<Silverscreen> 1,11With the Wii still playing GC games AND the GC still being sold, it's not retro.
<sonicandmario853> Quick_Thinker:your not old...
<Barbetos> To know what retro is you must define what retro is
<Quick_Thinker> and i've played the N64 and SNES
<AJIsAwesome> When did the NES come out?
<Barbetos> then apply that idea to games
<Reikim> What's going on, Regs?

<HoodyNinja> It should be in top ten, just not 1
<CiderIsForDrinking> Called it! :D
<DerpDash> MY BODY WASNT READY FOR #1 BECAUSE IT WAS ANTIclimatic :|
<otakon> no
<Mishia> Portal is fun :)
<Thrackerzod> ALL THE BUTTHURT
<LOGAN> AHHHHAHHAHHAHHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<otakon> it's good
<CrimsonPhoenix> it mixed FPS with Puzzle very well
<twilight_sprinkle> nah
<Thrackerzod> OH THE BUTHURT
<Dken2021> Portal 1 you say?
<DashWithRainbows> Actually, I'm mixed about this.
<otakon> but it is NOT No. 1
<The_Browncoat> Portal.... why Portal?
<AJIsAwesome> Um...................:S
<Reikim> On the other hand, no goddamn Metroid Prime anywhere. *throws a fit at SaxyPretender*
<Spectrum_Rush> i'm ok with this
<LadyCanary> Okay. I love Portal. But as 1? No.
<Mishia> but not for the top
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it had a very great concept
<Yahooz> How is that as good as tetris?
<LOGAN> PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Buytoast> oh wow
<Zephyr> Great game, but i wouldn't call it number 1...
<Buytoast> this is pitiful
<twilight_sprinkle> it was good, but it doest deserve first
<Barbetos> Portal makes perfect sense. It was short, sweet, and well done. It was fun. I did not stop playing that gmae at all when I started play it.
<otakon> Super Mario Bros. SHOULD BE NO. 1!
<Phase4> 00,02Portal is what puzle games should be, its the template for fun
<Mishia> im sorry, portal cannot be 1
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, Metroid Prime 1 should've been on there
<Derpy_Hooves> LOGAN: CALM.DOWN.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Seriously?
<Mishia> that is not ok
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Oh DEFINITELY.
<Dken2021> SaxyPretender I know!
<Spell-of-Gaming> There's already 501 kicks?
<Reikim> And number zero?
<CiderIsForDrinking> And I read this before :D
<Pinkies4thWall> CAKE
<Kandarihu> Mishia, most of the rage came from the VERY FIRST reveal about the cel shading.
<LOGAN> OKAY OKAY ookay
<twilight_sprinkle> this game was a test in the first place
<Buytoast> boy, this list eats more shit than a sentient toilet
<MadSurge> All the anger!
<Reikim> Also, why wasn't any of the Smash Bros games on there?
<LOGAN> AHHHHHHHHH PORTAL!!!!!!!
<Mishia> Kandarihu: I know, but it was the best game ever <3
<Silverscreen> 1,11There's a sh*tload of games out there that deserve #1 for their revolutionary, above-the-expectations what they brought about like Portal did.
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 And the fact it was really a stocking filler, focusing on the puzzles more and not the story as a whole.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tetris is simple but challenging to master
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: LOGIC!
<flutter_spin> eh. Tetris, really?
<Dken2021> and the characters were great too
<Phase4> 00,02Portals are an incredibly simple mechanic, used cleverly, to create incredibly interestin puzles
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I'm kinda disappointed in their picks for fighting games
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it develop your brain acitivity
<Mishia> No fallout 3?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Why were there no SSB games there?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Reikim: Smash Bros. Melee was on there.
<flutter_spin> Dr. Mario over Tetris
<Phase4> 00,02DashWithRainbows, but the story isnt the point in portal
<Reikim> Okay then, I'm cool.
<MirrorImage> Silverscreen - it was?
<Yahooz> Silverscreen: which number?
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: guess
<SaxyPretender> 0,14UMvC3 should NOT have been there
<Buytoast> well, at least now i know gamespot is a shitty place for good opinions on games
<DashWithRainbows> I know.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yes, it was. Sixty-something.
<Kandarihu> Mishia, it turned out to be that great. But please understand that we had no idea at the time.
<P4ngya> no seperate genre lists?
*PillowPoni|Phone has no ida what's going on
<Mishia> that game had its glitches, but tons of comdey, waring factions, people , and interactionS <3
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender That's because fighting games are underrated.
<Yahooz> Melee should be like top 20
<Spell-of-Gaming> ^
<Yahooz> better than COD :/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah =/
<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<Barbetos> Allegr0 or GigabitHarmonie Can you name the Spiritual predecessor to Portal?
<Reikim> I disagree Phase. The Story was plenty important. It was simply neither more nor less important than the mechanics. It got a perfect synergy with the mechanics...and that is what games should aim for.
<LOGAN> PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<Dken2021> DashWithRainbows, huh, don't remember you being a voiced
<Mishia> Kandarihu: i dont blame you guys. since i was a little girl, i dint give a flyin' buck about graphics
<twilight_sprinkle> portal 1 wasnt That original, it was based on other games iirc
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm okay really
<Franek12354> I NEUTRAL!!!!
<Dken2021> and hai DashWithRainbows
<Phase4> 00,02portal was just a "huh, lets make a game where you can do this" with a little bit of polish
<LOGAN> PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<Franek12354> HANDS DOWN
<Buytoast> Gamesradar is a shitty site
<AJIsAwesome> LOGAN: Calm down:|
<CrimsonPhoenix> it wasn't a sellout
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yeah, Portal is still a big no.
<WalkerPony89> Barbetos: It's on the tip of my tongue...
<Barbetos> DON'T GOOGLE IT!!
<RaveBrony> Then again, you cant Hate portal :D
<Barbetos> So far goo
<Barbetos> d
<LOGAN> IMSORRY!!!!!!!!! BUT ITS PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<Mishia> Silverscreen: fun? yes. 1st best game? no.

<Mishia> LOGAN: and i said HEYEYEYEYEYEAHHH HEYEYEYEAH i said hey! whats going on?
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Night!
<Mishia> lol
<Reikim> But then, it's hard to choose a "best" or "most influential" game. It's better to sit back and see things as a timeline that flows and splits and creates wonders as well as horrors.
<Dken2021> take care HoodyNinja
*Ponies47 Chucks his gameboy advance at a wall "Mother bucking piece of squee!" :[
<DashWithRainbows> Dken2021 oh, hey there.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Were one of the KH games in there?

<sub06905> Ponies47: why you throw ur gameboy? :<
<Phase4> 00,02Buytoast, its what you get when you make a game right
<Kandarihu> When the GCN first came out, Nintendo made a tech demo video of a realistic Zelda game that looked awesome (although it was nothing but video). We were all looking forward to that when Wind Waker was announced.
<LOGAN> me agree with Phase4
<Silverscreen> 1,11What WAS the question?
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie: You know what they say. A watched chat never stops.

<Yahooz> GigabitHarmonie: does Derpy have a "concrete" voice then?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: it lacks a proper story though. you can argue it doesnt need it, but other games can have both innovative gameplay and good story

<Buytoast> Saturday Super Sucky Rooty Tooty Equine Shooty Sirclejerk
*AJIsAwesome hugs Pinkies4thWall
<Reikim> Phase4: Yes, it does. But that doesn't mean it isn't important. It's synthesized with the gameplay in a way that more games should try to achieve. Let's be honest, Portal would not have sold as well without the story.
<twilight_sprinkle> disgunbegud.gif
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, its not explicitly a story sure, but when you combine it with environmental details it tells the story of what happened to apeture

<thegt90> i sound like the awnsering machine
<Kimori> wb
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: they built a robot, it turned evil. not much of a story
<Phase4> 00,02its not complete, its not suposed to be, its additional to the point of the game, wich is puzzles solved with portals
*Pinkies4thWall hugs AJIsAwesome
<Mishia> :3
<Ponies47> Oh and sub06905 don't worry. I didn't throw my gameboy at the wall :$
<Reikim> Oh lordy, TS is making a stupid and blatantly opinionated argument.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14TS?
<Reikim> Also obtuse. Should've used obtuse.
<sub06905> Ponies47: oh ok :P
<Pinkies4thWall> AJIsAwesome: /)
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...oh
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkies4thWall: (\
<Ponies47> sub06905: It just crapped out on me :/
<JRP> SuperBrony64|AFK:
<Reikim> Yeah
<Silverscreen> 1,11Typo. XD
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, it probably would have sold the same initialy, being part of the orange box, but it is one of the things is really love about the game
<sub06905> Ponies47: what game were you playing?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: like i said, a game with good gameplay+good story>game with just good gameplay
<Reikim> Phase4: /).
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, (\
<Reikim> He's kind of known for this.
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, thats all well and good but theres no room in portal for more story than there is
<Ponies47> sub06905: "Ed Ed n' Eddy The Mis-EDventures" :P
<LOGAN> im back
<Reikim> There's this...strange arrogance behind it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: not the way its made
<Yahooz> niiiiiice
<Dken2021> not spike!
<dshannon> spike lol
<sub06905> Ponies47: oh, never knew there was a ed edd n' eddy game for GBA
<MirrorImage> *record scratch*
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, and if it was made any other way it'd be a different game, with less emphasis on puzles
<Reikim> And I just don't like the way he argues in general. It's...pompous? Also obtuse. Unwilling to accept counterarguments.
<AJIsAwesome> GAWRRRSH, Twilight!:D
<LOGAN> hi
<Dken2021> Gwarsh Twilight
<Shizuka> 13it's called being a jerk
<Reikim> He'll blatently ignore points in favour of his own.
<Shizuka> 13and he's on thin ice
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: less emphasis on one thing doesnt make it worse, the game just offers more
<dshannon> -_-
<Barbetos> Allegr0 I have to admit I thought it was pinkie
<Shizuka> 13what are we arguing about now
<Quick_Thinker> this is too true i had a child hood friend who i left at least 10 years ago and after 5 years he showed back up in my life
<Reikim> Well there's being a jerk and then there's being an arrogant ponce.
<Ponies47> sub06905: There was 2. I have both The Mis-Edventures and the other 1 is called "Ed, Edd n' Eddy Jawbreakers!" :P
<Dken2021> just do rainbow dash in a christoipher reeves voice
<sub06905> dat rarity :D
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - Rarity's 3-pack a day raspy voice
<dshannon> o_o
<DerpDash> Needs japanese mouth dubbing too
<ShadowDash> :D
<LOGAN> Shizuka: if im a boy or not
<AndroUser> .
<Quick_Thinker> great pinkie pie
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, twilight_sprinkle is saying that gameplay + story is better than just gameplay, i'm arguing that portal in particular wouldnt work with more story
<Unnr> Portal´s story works because of the fact that so much of it is extrapolated from the environment anyways...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Where's Rarity
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Silverscreen's vision of the FiM finale
<twilight_sprinkle> actually, what im saying is that Portal 1 isnt the best game of all time..
<AJIsAwesome> DAT GOOFY VOICE:D
<Yahooz> OH BOY
<LadyCanary> gooby
<Reikim> It's called an atmospheric game. It's a genre. Done.
<Dovah> what are they doing?
<Shizuka> 13if gameplay is strong on its own, it doesn't need story
<MirrorImage> Allegr0 - you MUST use that voice now if you do a fanfic reading that involves Spike from now on
<Shizuka> 13see minecraft
<Yahooz> ldycabary plz
<ShadowDash> i just waa WHATS GOING ON :[
<Shizuka> 13see also doom
<otakon> Shizuka: it's LEGO
<MadSurge> Shizuka: YESH
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, well i diagree but thats always going to be personal opinion
<CrimsonPhoenix> more Doom
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: it doesnt Need it, but a game with both is better
<otakon> LEGO
<CrimsonPhoenix> I get bored of Minecraft
<Azuredragon> he everypony whats streaming?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same goes for BuyToast
<Shizuka> 13not really
<otakon> oh God what am I listening to?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14=_=
<cachi01|mobile> See also yume nikki lol
<Shizuka> 13see doom 3
<Thrackerzod> I have no feels sorry
<Azuredragon> hey*
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, adding a story to minecraft would ruin it
<Reikim> I kind of generically pass over his comments at this point, really.
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again I get bored on any sandbox game
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i never played a doom
<Shizuka> 13if you're arguing for gameplay plus GOOD story, that's a higher standard than just gameplay with story
<Phase4> 00,02it'd distract from the sandbox
<cachi01|mobile> Phase4 well that ending was really awesome
<Reikim> I disagree, Phase4. Adding an OFFICIAL story would ruin it. Now, creating your own story...that's what it's really for.
<JESmith71> otakon: They're reading something Silver wrote
<Quick_Thinker> then BURP
<DerpDash> lool BEEERP
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, ^
<otakon> Silverscreen: you wrote a fanfic?
<ShadowDash> ok
<MadSurge> GAWRSH
<Yahooz> GOSH JOLLY GEE
<Silverscreen> 1,11I guess you could call it a fanfic.
<Quick_Thinker> what was that from?
<Dken2021> that was some A movie material there
<Reikim> It is a fanfic.
<AJIsAwesome> Christopher Walken for Rarity, please!
<otakon> Shizuka: Does Bioshock count?
<ShadowDash> GEE WIZ GUY
<Reikim> No ifs ands or buts, it was a fanfic.
<flutter_spin> Question: Can we hear from your fiancee?
<Yahooz> GOLLY WOLLY
<cachi01|mobile> What if minecraft becomes like Little Big Planet?
<ShadowDash> bwowoy woy
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: well thats what i was saying, clearly a bad story wont make it better. i meant good gameplay+good story>just good gameplay
<DerpDash> xD
<PillowPoni|Phone> Silverscreen: link to your story please? I'm on my phone ._.
<Franek12354> xD
<Yahooz> ......................
<cades> brb imma restart my computer
<ShadowDash> awww ok i will feel bad
<Thrackerzod> XD
<DerpDash> Merfins!!!!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I believe there's a /ignore command
<AJIsAwesome> Thrackerzod: :P
<Buytoast> forcing_fandom_into_show_canon.wav
<CrimsonPhoenix> a lirrle bit more and it's the exact voice of thrackerzord
<Dken2021> mmmmm, chocolate
<Lunac> Sunds like a cabinet minister
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: there are exceptions like minecraft, but we were talking about portal 1
<Reikim> Shizuka: Don't listen to him, he was really arguing that Portal doesn't have a story. That was the stupid part.
<ShadowDash> I MUST GO NORTH TO GET THE BIRDS
<Shizuka> 13depends on how the story is presented
<Dken2021> Buytoast like usual
<Buytoast> yup
<Shizuka> 13too much and you're just making a movie
<Shizuka> 13see mass effect
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like MGS4
<MirrorImage> spike's voice?
<Thrackerzod> XD
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut :D
<DerpDash> Enji?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka, Myst is a story game?
<Dken2021> I am
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: like i said, GOOD story plus GOOD gameplay
<Shizuka> 13rendering a preview of my video
<ShadowDash> g2g
<MadSurge> DAT FEMALE VOICE
<Reikim> Ooh
<DerpDash> bye ShadowDash
<Shizuka> 13but mass effect had good both
<Reikim> Gonna stream it?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i dont think we've seen good interactive story yet
<Shizuka> 13not til it's done
<Phase4> 00,02mass effect gets close
<XylemTube> i VOTE cOLGATE
<Reikim> Ah well
<Reikim> Can't wait~
<XylemTube> caps
<cachi01|mobile> Phase4 heavy rain counts??
<Lunac> Female voice not transvestite
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: i havent played mass effect
<Dken2021> he did, in the background
<Phase4> 00,02cachi01|mobile, i've not played it so cant really comment
<Shizuka> 13heavy rain sounded like it went too far to the story side, forgot about gameplay
<Dken2021> ...pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Helloooo
<Shizuka> 13its predecessor fahrenheit too
<AJIsAwesome> Gravity Falls is a pretty good show.
<Phase4> 00,02^ Shizuka, thatws what i've heard
<cachi01|mobile> Phase4 well its pretty gold
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka is quite female you know
<otakon> Shizuka: it was a good story though
<Shizuka> 13(and i played fahrenheit... despite cameos from like half the Code Lyoko VAs, the story was mediocre and the gameplay nonexistent)
<otakon> yes yes she is CrimsonPhoenix
<CiderIsForDrinking> lol
<Reikim> As a writer I can tell you write now, good interactive story isn't going to happen for a very long time.
<AdamTheDuck> Octavia yeah!
<otakon> Shizuka: I liked it
<DerpyMuffins> Never though he would do this voice
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: if youre saying that mass effect had too much movieness to it, then thats not good enough gameplay then
<Reikim> Very. Long. Time.
<AJIsAwesome> I love Code Lyoko.
<Unnr> cachi01|mobile: Heavy Rain tended to get lost in story, also the use of sixaxis tends to devorce the player from the action, instead of inhance it
<Mishia> omg
<cachi01|mobile> I cant say a lot of Fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) cause i`ve never playedbit
<Mishia> :D
<Buytoast> did wsomeone say Code Lyoko?
<Dken2021> you just need hooves giga
<cachi01|mobile> Played it*
<Buytoast> shit i use to watch that show voraciously
<Mishia> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Is there still the Cello/Bass debate?
<Shizuka> 13but it's a balance, if you're going to have super fantastic story, you're going to sacrifice gameplay
<Mishia> MAGIIC
<Phase4> 00,02the problem i have with mass effect is that you have to shoot things
<otakon> Shizuka: true
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka, how about Myst?
<Spriggals> Nice voice there pretty boy
<Mishia> XD
<Shizuka> 13but if you have super fantastic gameplay, you make your own story
<Mishia> pick a voice, son!
<Phase4> 00,02that doesnt interest me soo muhc
<CiderIsForDrinking> AJIsAwesome: Yes
<otakon> Phase4: well the first one made due with more mechanics based then sklled
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: not necessarily, just needs to feel like youre IN the great story
<otakon> Shizuka: but Red Dead Redemption
<Mishia> what is the tale that is being told?
<Major> Night All :P
<Shizuka> 13myst's story is largely locked up in in-game text and the physical books
<otakon> BASS
<otakon> BASE
<Unnr> The thing is that it is nearly impossible to break new ground in gameplay, while at the same time provide a complete and moving story
<otakon> NOT BASS
<AJIsAwesome> Major: Night!
<Silverscreen> 1,11http://pastebin.com/3Vv6Edaz
<otakon> BASE! SAY BASE
<Shizuka> 13but its' gameplay makes up for it
<Phase4> 00,02myst did its story excelently
<Silverscreen> 1,11If you're interesting in reading my story.
<Phase4> 00,02the ingame portion anyway
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mmm, bass
<cachi01|mobile> KINGDOM HEARTS
<cachi01|mobile> IT HAS BOTH GREAT STORY
<cachi01|mobile> AND GAMEPLAY
<Unnr> too many resources in a game with ground breaking gameplay go to making the gameplay element work (or as so often happens, not work)
<CiderIsForDrinking> Oyus
<Unnr> cachi01|mobile: did we play the same Kingdom Hearts 1?
<Dken2021> cachi01|mobile imo, story is all over the place
<Shizuka> 13the story in game was the canonicity of you exploring the world, things were hinted to you but the vast majority of the actual details are in journals (reading, not gaming) or in the books
<Spriggals> SHOW US
<Mishia> what.is.this.story
<AJIsAwesome> My body is ready?
<Reikim> Myst is in the same bracket as Portal in that the story isn't given to you; it's cached in the game, and whether you choose to discover it is really up to you. It's an atmospheric game, really.
<Shizuka> 13not bad, but it's not quite gameplay married to story
<CiderIsForDrinking> <3
<MirrorImage> Allegr0 - you MUST put it on the strea... aww
<cachi01|mobile> Unnr yes lol i love KH
<thegt90> do it
<Mishia> #rainbowdash
<RaveBrony> :o
<flutter_spin> well tell us what it is
<Buytoast> did someone draw scat inflation porn again?
<Franek12354> GigabitHarmonie: :D Soory for some spelling
<Buytoast> show it
<JESmith71> cachi01|mobile: Well gameplay's not as good in CoM, Days, or Coded
<Thrackerzod> Allegr0 pm me it then
<Unnr> There are many gameplay problems with is, particularly the camera
<flutter_spin> I WANT TO KNOW
<flutter_spin> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i'd kinda disagree there, someone in the situation as the guy on myst would work that way
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, reading books to find out what happend, experimenting with knobs and levers, so on
<Franek12354> xD
<Phase4> 00,02myst made me feel like i was stuck on an island
<cachi01|mobile> JESmith71 days made me cry like a little girl
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you know I'd say Assassin's Creed does a nice combo between story and gameplay
<cachi01|mobile> Lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14as in, the gameplay IS the story
<SaxyPretender> 0,14in a way
<flutter_spin> ^^ Shiz. I checked out your channel and everything. Didn't know you liked Myst
<Shizuka> 13revelation does it a little better with the memory amulet having the characters narrate journals to you, which lent the emotion into what writing fonts alone don't deliver
<XylemTube> Screw that Colgate is best Backround pony
<Shizuka> 13it's there, but not quite to the extent that something like mass effect would present story
<Reikim> AC isn't perfect but I respect it.
<Shizuka> 13it's more subtle
<Shizuka> 13which is good :)
<cachi01|mobile> Xion :`(
<Reikim> It doesn't have the best story either, but it was a step in the right direction.
<Mishia> PINKIE
<Reikim> I'll take AC over Halo any day, thank you very much.
<Polydunami> Honestly, the bg pony I'd like to see more of the most is Octavia :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I like both >.>
<Dken2021> Luna's a background pony?
<Polydunami> Or something to that effect
<otakon> Derpy
<otakon> Love me some Derpy
<Reikim> I like the concept of Halo.
<Reikim> I like the potential of the universe.
<Dken2021> lol, this doesn't look like studying
<Reikim> I don't think the games are exploiting it enough.
<Mishia> backround means they have a lack of mentions, appearances, and lines
<Phase4> ^
<flutter_spin> Question: Can I still send in my answer to you guys and read it?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14perfectly understandable
<Reikim> But then, they don't have to, since MS is making money by the assloads.
<Franek12354> Half way through
<XylemTube> Molestia is best celestia
<Buytoast> holy fuck did this guy send in a report on why he loves a cartoon horse holy shit
<RaveBrony> Oh god
<Phase4> Shizuka, the reading to find out what happened i personally like
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I mean, the games do the necessary expostion
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, the background charcter I would like to see the most is all of them. I don't play favorites when it comes to stuff like this.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but the real meat in the story lies in the books
<Polydunami> My god
<Ponies47> Buytoast: Who?
<Yahooz> Dude
<AJIsAwesome> *character*
<Franek12354> heheheee
<cades> do you know about spyro eclipse?
<Buytoast> whoever sent this e-mail
<Franek12354> no
<Buytoast> holy shit
<Yahooz> thats some deidcation
<SaxyPretender> 0,14looks like they're trying to up the story telling for Halo 4
<Ponies47> Buytoast: Oh :P
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ponies IS your homework.
<Reikim> Oh, I also like a lot of the sci-fi aesthetics of the concept.
<Buytoast> this has gone beyond sad
<RaveBrony> :D
<Buytoast> this is just disturbing
<Shizuka> 13halo 1 did next to nothing with the universe... what i remember of halo 2 fleshed out the covenant some more but not a whole lot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14there's two novel trilogies that are tying directly into Halo 4
<Shizuka> 13haven't sat through a playthrough of halo 3 yet
<Reikim> But I've got the biggest soft spot for space operas anyways.
<Yahooz> In the name of Poniator
<XylemTube> qtf is this anyways?
<otakon> ...
<Yahooz> PONIES DO NOT WAIT
<Unnr> Theres a fine line as a writer of games that has yet to be met. How do you create a game where the players actions matter in the long run, but still present a story? Everytime there is a branch of potential paths, you have to write more story to cover both the original (or intended path) heads, as well as the new path. Each an every time
<otakon> GET ON WITH IT!
<Thrackerzod> YES GET ON WITH IT
<Phase4> i know little of halo, but halo 3 ends with the flood problem being solved iirc
*otakon hands out torches and pitchforks to chat.
<Yahooz> YEAAAAAH
<Reikim> I cannot help liking stuff with awesome high-tech spaceships and lazers and things.
<Phase4> so not sure where you can go from there
<otakon> GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Unnr> This is why ME2 didn´t seem to go anywhere with adding ideas to the ME
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same, Reikim
<Yahooz> lawl Holy Grail
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Phase4
<AJIsAwesome> CUE THE MONTY PYTHON REFERENCE
<Franek12354> KO Answer
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if you beat H3 on the highest difficulty
<Shizuka> 13now remember
*Quick_Thinker rejects otakons offer and grabs a chainsaw instead
<Yahooz> woooooooah
<Shizuka> 13this is a secret
<Unnr> universe, they had to start and end roughly the same place so that the first and last games could work
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: BURN HER! SHE'S A WITCH!
<Phase4> i've seen that ending
<otakon> OH MY GOD!
<Yahooz> Franek12354: damn
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/me_RJE91HdA don't tell anyone
<Buytoast> holy cunt slapping weasel thu8mpers
<Buytoast> it never ends
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, k
<Polydunami> inb4 postscript >:3
<AJIsAwesome> Franek12354: You are awesome for doing that.
<MadSurge> SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
<Franek12354> :D
<otakon> IT IS THE LETTER THAT NEVER ENDS
<Phase4> he's in half a ship and its going to hit a planet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...so, I shouldn't have tweeted thta
<XylemTube> Thanks franek!
<otakon> Franek12354: THE HELL MAN
<Silverscreen> 1,11Unnr, play Fallout New Vegas. Your actions in that game have long term effects on every faction that you can and will interact with, fusing actions with story conseqsuences rather well.
<otakon> Franek12354: that was longer than War in Peace
<MadSurge> IT JUST GOES ON AND ON MY FRIEND
<otakon> Silverscreen: great example
<flutter_spin> Can I still send mine in?
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> CLOUD CHASER
<Kimori> umm no I dont
<Yahooz> Oh mai
<otakon> ...
<Unnr> Silverscreen: I have played NV, and compared to earlier Fallout games, your interaction in the long run meant nothing
<flutter_spin> Cloud Chaser
<otakon> no idea
<Spectrum_Rush> Allegr0: Cloud Chase
<MadSurge> Ohhh
<Phase4> 00,02cloudchaser i think
<twilight_sprinkle> just to be clear though, i wasnt saying portal 1 is a bad game, its a great game actually and its one of my favorite games ever. i just dont think its the best of all time
<Spectrum_Rush> *Cloudchaser
<Yahooz> Bam
<flutter_spin> Allegr0: I guess its too late to send mine in
<otakon> :P only messing with you Franek12354
<otakon> Silly Filly Saturdays
<cades> http://www.youtube.com/user/hoixsoft?feature=results_main
<Quick_Thinker> I HAVE BEEN DYING FOR IT
<Unnr> Particularly as there was still a bit of a disjunct between NPC reactions to what you have done, and the more faction obvious NPC reactions
<Phase4> lol 'clip 3'
<Quick_Thinker> Allegr0 I ONLY HAVE ONE KEY NOT MORE THEN 1
<twilight_sprinkle> dat pinkie lol. would be fitting for me
<Unnr> It was a massive improvement from Fallout 3, where the story wasn´t that of the vault dweller, but that of hir father´s
<cades> hes programming a new spyro game thats supposed to be like the original trilogy
<Phase4> 00,02i have a key for smite beta
<Phase4> 00,02cant make the thing work
<Silverscreen> 1,11really? Because being randomly attacked by powerful legion assholes and finding that there are a lot of story arcs that you f**ked over by previous actions makes it pretty important.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Unnr: Hir?
<Quick_Thinker> 2?
<Reikim> Hm, Shizu...I think the transition could use a bit of work.
<Shizuka> 13i thought of having the skyrim clip there but it works better to punch the second half of the bgm
<Unnr> Gender neutral term for his/her
<Polydunami> Hooray Quick_Thinker!
<Quick_Thinker> how did you get another?
<Shizuka> 13the blink works, there's just only one pair of clips that have it atm
<Quick_Thinker> h
<Polydunami> inb4 Quick_Thinker wins :3
<Quick_Thinker> nope
<Reikim> The audio transition is a bit jarring, right now. Only in my opinion though.
<otakon> Silverscreen: yes it does
<Quick_Thinker> i didnt vote
<otakon> bugger
<Yahooz> Allegr0: Random.org
<Shizuka> 13when i do tests i tend to leave a whole lot unpolished :3
<otakon> YES!
<Phase4> 00,02Roll a d20!

<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> GET THE CAMERA AND ROLL THE DICE!
<otakon> let us SEE IT
<flutter_spin> D100
<otakon> wheelchair?
<Unnr> I am not saying its *not* important, I am just saying that there are less branch points than you would expect if you were to actually sit down and look at points of divergence
<Spriggals> Do your sean connery
<Quick_Thinker> i will say who ever wins it my account name is RioGascar
<Phase4> 00,02Hello, it is *roll dice* good to meet you
<otakon> Allegr0: what happened to your legs?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Futurama reference.

<Reikim> What did I miss?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dats nice
<Phase4> 00,02rest in peace guygax
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's not just dice. Now it's fucking dice.
<Yahooz> anyway, so my suggestion awkwarded the stream :3
<Shizuka> 13the plasma pong bit will work better when there's something after it
<Unnr> *gygax
<Silverscreen> 1,11bone dice.
<Yahooz> my deed is done
