<AJIsAwesome> HI, RDash5000. :)
<Ponies47> Hey RDash5000
*thelonepony helps Ponies47 hide
<CriticKitten> Shizu: It's gonna boil down to Ohio. Republicans haven't won without Ohio, and that one is absolutely key to a Romney win. His odds decrease dramatically without it.
<Hoody|Games> RDash5000: Holla
<StinkomanFan> Why? LOL 'cuz

<Shizuka> 13oh is that the presidents one?
<J_E_Smith71> Barney: Oh Barney is a dinosaur, looks like a grape on steroids...
<otakon> lovely
<Barney> 0,5Because if I don't input a message that's what it puts. the person's name.
<otakon> yay
<Shizuka> 13oh no the precedent one that was fun
<otakon> well at least the colors are gone
<Shizuka> 13i like the giant charts he did recently of the house/senate and presidents
<Tovler|twibfm> I can't take refuge in the moon because of Newt Gingrich's moon colony.

<thelonepony> Hi AVS619 :)
<Hoody|Games> AVS619: Sup sucka?
<CriticKitten> NullRadix: It's true until it's broken. And the odds of a Romney win are VERY small without Ohio.
<Ryunosuke> comet parties

<J_E_Smith71> Go bug you dad, go bug to you mom, to buy you a Barney CD-ROM
<NullRadix> GIANT CHARTS ABOUT US POLITICS. Tiny comic for the "universal label"
<AVS619> oh god no
<CriticKitten> So that comic, while cute, is still wrong. :p
<Ponies47> Hi AVS619
<Deadlypon3> Is anypony watching Comedy Central instead of the news networks :p?
<picasso> if you have to vomit
<NullRadix> Deadlypon3: I would be if I still watched TV
<twoiloight_spurnkle> we need a barney bot
<fluttercry> 05,15Deadlypon3 I will when John Stewart comes on
<thelonepony> twoiloight_spurnkle: to scare away the trolls? :P
<Deadlypon3> Nullradix I need some cheering up, so I am watching the electioonthingie
<RDash5000> and even further... we see the wonderful land of equestria. 5000 lightyears away :)
<Deadlypon3> It's Colbert right now :p
<twoiloight_spurnkle> thelonepony: i didnt know trolls were afraid of barney
<Deadlypon3> Billions and BILLIOns of Puma Man
<thelonepony> neither do i >:3
<NullRadix> Deadlypon3: wait... wait... you're watching the election... to cheer up?
<NullRadix> what?
<CriticKitten> NullRadix: So, yes, it can happen. But it hasn't. And it very likely won't this time. Romney needs Ohio.
<Deadlypon3> NullRadix The comedy Central thing :P
<NullRadix> oh
<NullRadix> kay
<picasso> at least its in the universe
<diddutz> Anyone having any advice how to bypass the country restriction of comedy centraly election night stream?
<Deadlypon3> I dunoo...I don't play Nethack :p
<twoiloight_spurnkle> diddutz: well one way would be to use a proxy, but idk an easy way to get a proxy fast enough for a stream. plus it depends on who restricted it, your country or whoevers streaming
<RDash5000> and then the earth exploded twice. THE END
<Hoody|Games> Sweet
<AVS619> Twice?
<picasso> tor if it isn't blocked like it is for this chat
<Hoody|Games> Still a better ending than (gets shot
<diddutz> twoiloight_spurnkle: nope, flash player is not affected by the proxy, already tried that ^^

*RDash5000 is uncomfortable

<fluttercry> 05,15162/163
<CriticKitten> Ooo, Ohio's down to 51-48.
<Kurra> I love how cliffhanger this is, it's so epic :D
<fluttercry> 05,15It's stressful
<Shizuka> 13ha, johnson has 1% of the vote in minnesota so far, 3% reporting in
<fluttercry> 05,15Funny at onl 3% they're already calling Obama
<RDash5000> the way he pronounces things is awesome :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> bullshaped
<Shizuka> 13inb4 minnesota is blue again only because johnson split the republican vote here
<jezzybelly> -_- oh god it's gunna be Obama again
<CriticKitten> Go Gary!
<jezzybelly> bull crap
<AttackWithHugs> I'm scared for real about this election
<Kurra> So apparently, there's also the Consitution party, the Green party, and the Libertarian party running for the presidency. :)
<Shizuka> 13google's a teeny bit behind, still 159/148 romney
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: Based on early results and exit polling they can call some states pretty early

<Kurra> 50/48% Obama in Ohio :O

<Kurra> And the NLR, and the... whatever Celestia's thing is called....
<picasso> i didn't vote because it wouldn't have made an effect
<SpeccyRush> wait Obama got ohio?
<Hoody|Games> Yep, AR is red
<donutpop365> Yodolaaaaeeeeeeehooo.
<Hoody|Games> Saw that coming
<CriticKitten> Obama doesn't have Ohio yet.
<CriticKitten> It's blue leaning though.
<Shizuka> 13SpeccyRush: not yet, it's split hard and a little under half the votes are in
<Jakeryii> I almost wrote in Celestia...
<CriticKitten> About 3% lead for Obama right now.
<Ryunosuke> msnbc is reporting 163/162 romney
<Kurra> You guys remember the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear? :D
<Shizuka> 13oh wow, look at my link, look at florida

<CriticKitten> NBC is jumping too far ahead.
<AttackWithHugs> Kurra, somewhat a little, yeah

<twoiloight_spurnkle> oh god, Barney is naked!!
<Midnight_Fyre> My biggest hope is that whoever wins does so by over 29 electoral votes so we don't have another giant battle over Florida
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Florida's been a razorthin margin, as close as 21k votes at some times
<Kurra> AttackWithHugs: I went to that, there were fursuiters and zentai guys and it was SO FUN! </sweetiebelle>
<Barney> 9,6I love politics
<NullRadix> ah Florida
<AttackWithHugs> Kurra, I am soooo jealous.
<NullRadix> how could we have an interesting election without Florida...
<Buytoast> good ol' Illinois
<Buytoast> bluer than the first smurf
<Shizuka> 13and yet you get out of chicago illinois is pretty solid red
<Ryunosuke> i am not a huge fan of far right, I am more of .. middle right?

<Midnight_Fyre> Fun fact: Yesterday I was called a traitor, likened to a Holocaust deniar, and told to go shoot myself just for predicting that Obama would win
<Kurra> Nope!
<twoiloight_spurnkle> so when can we expect final results?
<donutpop365> Kurra: Florida?
<AJIsAwesome> Midnight_Fyre: :S
<Buytoast> this election will be the one to shatter the sanctity of the world and rock it to its very core

<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Sometime before midnight, I'd expect. XD
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: They are tho :(
<Sarah_B> I just don't want to get banned is all
<Sarah_B> thanks :)
*thelonepony hits HoodyNinja with the chancla :I
<Ryunosuke> its a shame though
<hen3ry> We don't have a pants check
*HoodyNinja eats thelonepony's hair
<Jmo> o_O
<thelonepony> bad hoody bad :I
<CriticKitten> Now just watch. Florida will end up pulling a 2000, and we'll all be trolled for a good week.
<RDash5000> aren't physics just dandy?
<Ryunosuke> with Luger out of the senate race, they most likely lost indiana senate seat
<HoodyNinja> Florida you dick
<jezzybelly> sigh... looks like Obama's winning
<hen3ry> nah, Romney needs more than just Florida to troll the nation anyway
<Ryunosuke> he would have won with 70-80% of the vote
<CriticKitten> America: "Florida, pick a damn winner." Florida: "OMG SO HARD TO DECIIIIIIIDE ;-;"
<NullRadix> RDash5000: you say that now. Then someone pushes you out a window
<HoodyNinja> You know, there ARE other states besides Florida...
<Sarah_B> I'm a democrat, but I think Romney has this election. It would be monumental for Obama to win given the economy
<hen3ry> heresy
<CriticKitten> And most of them are called for. :P
<AVS619> god damn this shit is close
<Ryunosuke> but then again, kinda hard to vote against someone who's been in the senate for a good part of 30 years :)
<hen3ry> Sarah_B: Obama's got this in the bag.
<RDash5000> NullRadix: and as i'm falling, i yell "PHYSICS!!!!! FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!! *splat*
<Sarah_B> I hope so, but still kinda doubtful
<fluttercry> 05,15Sarah_B it's pretty close
<CriticKitten> The big ones that Romney needs are Ohio and Florida, Virginia would help a lot too. I think if Romney loses Ohio, though, it'll all fall apart for him.
<fluttercry> 05,15Obama is leading in Electoral Votes right now
<HoodyNinja> RDash5000: Its a first-floor window
<Sarah_B> is he?
<hen3ry> Romney has to pretty much win every single state that hasn't been called.
<Sarah_B> oh shit. checking!!
<RDash5000> HoodyNinja: physics
<Shizuka> 13google's holding at 159/148 romney
<RDash5000> win
<hen3ry> except the west coast (which are Obamas anyway)
<CriticKitten> So is Yahoo.
<Midnight_Fyre> Sarah_B: The numbers so far say otherwise. Given the economy a strong Republican candidate should be able to win easily, but the GOP has spent the last four years becoming more radical and shooting itself in the foot
<Jakeryii> no winner in flordia...
<fluttercry> 05,15VA is 49/50 for Romney right now, but more northern counties are still returning results
<jezzybelly> oh god the numbers
<CriticKitten> Ohio is within 2, Florida's within 1
<hen3ry> NoVa is where 99% of Obama's voters live in Virginia.
<jezzybelly> I bet it will be a tie
<Sarah_B> fluttercry thanks for the update! woo
<CriticKitten> Virginia's only 40k votes apart. ._.
<jezzybelly> wouldn't be fricking awesome?
<jezzybelly> two presidents
<jezzybelly> lol

<hen3ry> tie isn't happening.
*Tovler|twibfm goes into a pity party chatroom
<CriticKitten> Wat.
<superretroworld> idk whos doing what, plus im not american
<WallDives> means senate picks vp, house picks pres.
<hen3ry> The tiebreaker is the House votes
<CriticKitten> Florida just went brown on my map. The fuck does that mean.
<CriticKitten> :|
<hen3ry> It just went for... Roseanne
<HoodyNinja> CriticKitten: Shit hit the fan?
<jezzybelly> well, numbers are flying all over the place
<Jakeryii> Its mean no selted winner
<twoiloight_spurnkle> lol HoodyNinja thats what i was thinking
*CriticKitten locates the map key
<fluttercry> 05,15CriticKitten they just gave up

<Sarah_B> Florida seems to be democratic this election
<jezzybelly> why do no one vote independent
<jezzybelly> always democrat or republican
<HoodyNinja> Shizuka: Thank you
<WallDives> long, complicated story...
<jezzybelly> I want difference
<CriticKitten> Yahoo count is 168-148, Romney.
<CriticKitten> But the west coast isn't in yet, so Romney has an uphill battle.
<fluttercry> 05,15Strange, ABC count is 173/163 Obama
<HoodyNinja> and ABC is talking about racial votes :I
<HoodyNinja> Fuck this country
<RDash5000> ^
<Shizuka> 13they're calling states way too early
<CriticKitten> ABC and NBC predict too early.
<Sarah_B> lol racial votes
<jezzybelly> that's journalism for you
<CriticKitten> They were calling some states with only 5% of the vote.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Shizuka> 13what votes are in are split hard in most of the important states
<CriticKitten> So I stopped looking at theirs.
<superretroworld> HoodyNinja: fuck this country for making ppl talk about politics
<picasso> if i was in dc i would vote incumbent too
<Sarah_B> I just want to know Ohio

<Saturn> 08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: neither is MLG this year
<Saturn> 08,01both are NBC
<hen3ry> There are 6 states that are still open. Of those, Idaho and Alaska are for Romney, the other four (California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii) are for Obama.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> The... news channel?
<HoodyNinja> Romney winning in electorals
<hen3ry> none of them are swing states.
<HoodyNinja> 170/148
<Yahooz> Oh we talkin politics?
<hen3ry> And California is "really big."
<Yahooz> Romney wins popular, but Obama wins election
<Yahooz> bam
<HoodyNinja> Yahooz: Seemingly yes
<Yahooz> 2000 repeat\
<Midnight_Fyre> HoodyNinja: That's just because the west coast hasn't been called yet
<Buytoast> of course alaska is for romney
<Buytoast> they're far enough not to give a shit
<jezzybelly> this is the most excite I've been for elections
<HoodyNinja> Midnight_Fyre: I know
<fluttercry> 05,15The states that matter that are up in the air are Virginia, Florida, and Ohio
<hen3ry> Doubt it. The west coast will push Obama over the top in the popular vote too - not that it matters that much
<Shizuka> 13fox is calling 174/163 romney so far, not terribly surprising
<Yahooz> hes going to win florida, win virginia, lose Ohio, lose Colorado, and then thats it
<fluttercry> 05,15Well yeah....Fox
<Buytoast> haha
<Buytoast> Faux News
<fluttercry> 05,15MSNBC is probably doing the same for Obama
<jezzybelly> fox...
<Yahooz> CNN was saying 152/143 Romney last time i checked
<Shizuka> 13let's find out
<WallDives> Fixed News.
<CriticKitten> If Romney drops Ohio or Florida at this point, he's probably dead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh America
<DeadpoolDash> its too early right now for predictions
<pony_666> but so is cnn and most others
<CrimsonPhoenix> you so funny
<fluttercry> 05,15Both those channels are poison
<hen3ry> Yup. Any of the big swings left are Must Win

<CrazyHippie> seems legit
<Marx> Reps, at least retain the House...
<VenHur> Shizuka: You're not an Ursa silly...OR IS SHE? [DUN DUN DUUUUUN]
<Ryunosuke> well
<weeping_pegasi82> Leave it to Beaver thing
<RawketLawnchair> . . .I don't think he'd be able to carry that.

<thelonepony> Derpy_Hooves: /)
<Ryunosuke> according to nbc, only 7% of cali reported so far
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: Well, watchu gonna do?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe this election will teach some businessmen to stop being assholes and hide their intentions. Probably not, though. I do think if Romney loses, it'll be due to his cockiness.
<Derpy_Hooves> thelonepony: (\ now i can tear up my suicide letter :3
<pony_6899> It looks like Obama's going to win an Politico.com
<Derpy_Hooves> lol jk
<Ryunosuke> cali is predominately democrat
<eddmario> And then he eat's fries with ketchup off of it, and it turns out to be frozen shit
<Tovler|Cry> Now I'm free to push on 0bama without letting that evil thing win.
<VenHur> Yep, BarRockman Obama woned again. (hoof up if you known the joke)
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_discord that, and calling 47% of americans...hopeless
<Kurra> :D!
<CrazyHippie> dose computerz
<Marx> He cannot be reelected again in the next election. He's definitely gone after this new term (kinda obvious who I'm for, huh?)
<Tovler|Cry> see. I used a 0 instead of O.

<hen3ry> Shizuka: it's not north-south in California, it's Coast-Inland.
<J_E_Smith71> TO THOSE GUYS LOOKING AT GOOGLE: It's over. They're slow. Obama won. I'm flipping between NBC FOX ABC and my 24 hour local station News 14 and are all saying Obama won
<donutpop365> Tom: Wooh!
<Kurra> I still have Netscape Navigator 4.0.3 sitting somewhere....
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka, kinda like iIL
<Ryunosuke> *IL
<Derpy_Hooves> thelonepony: rumor had it that romney was going to void the "Dream acxt" if he won
<superretroworld> Tom: make me a sandwich
<Derpy_Hooves> act*
<Tovler|Cry> Is weed legal in state X?
<VenHur> So I'm thinking Shizuka is not approved of Obama's re-election, isn't she?

<Shizuka> 13VenHur: more of a "my future just got destroyed" thing
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: 2014
<fluttercry> 05,15The way I see it, this is Obama's chance to prove that I made the right choice. If it turns out he doesn't, then I'll be really pissed at him.
<otakon> Saturn: a fun test or a bad test?
<Kanda|EndOfPonyFast> I'm very worried about this
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: pie him in the face
<eddmario> BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
<jezzybelly> If season 3 premiered during the election, I wonder which we would be talking about
<Tovler|Cry> hmm, 62% of US bronies supported Romney 38% other.
<Time> Boing
<HoodyNinja> fluttercry: Because Obama cares only about your opinion

<NullRadix> I've swapped between all three hosts
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: i agree on that

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't you mean does not fall ?
<donutpop365> I suspect it still will.
<Jmo> 'My server is ready'
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Making sure it doesn't crash like it did during the finale? It did for me
<Saturn> 08,01J_E_Smith71: exactly
<Ryunosuke> basically he is testing the connections

<sub06905> pffffttt..... Abraham Lincoln should have won: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0et8URog1r2qn3to10_400.gif
<Marx> It's as good a vote as any Scoot-Scootaloo.
<thelonepony> Yay Colbert report :D
<donutpop365> Saturn: Is BronyState locally hosted by BronyState?
<DeadpoolDash> well this wont be a 1980 landslide
<DerpyMuffins> Scoot-Scootaloo :P

<Marx> But yes, our debt. HOW can you ignore that?!
<Shizuka> 13so obama gets the electoral vote, romney has the popular vote
<Shizuka> 13anyone that complained about 2000 should just shut up now
<picasso> really you can just print money
<fluttercry> 05,15It's 2000 reverse
<bluestroms> hello everyone
<donutpop365> Shizuka: Yep.
<hen3ry> The only difference between the GOP and Dems on debt is who they waste the money on. Both parties blow up the debt
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<thelonepony> hi bluestroms :)
<AttackWithHugs> Hi bluestroms
<bluestroms> btw obama won
<Marx> Watch, the stock market's gonna crash tomorrow.

<weeping_pegasi82> Derpy_Hooves: too many numbers 6_9
<Marx> Or go down a lot, you know what I mean.
<DeadpoolDash> gary is messing up ohio and florida
<pony_6899> Yeah, they already declared him winner.
<eddmario> picasso: I had actually mentioned that, but it'd cause the value of the dollar to drop.\
<hen3ry> Nah, market likes stability. It'll just be rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic.
<CriticKitten> According to Yahoo, Florida and Virginia are both turds, but Obama is still projected to win.
<VenHur> Lol
<Derpy_Hooves> the us national debt.... is over $16,000,000,000,000

<hen3ry> Oil down a bit, manufacturing up a bit
<picasso> back it with gold
<Shizuka> 13it's projected to break 22t by the end of this term
<dingus> I can't tell if Obama winning is a good or bad this
<Saturn> 08,01donutpop365: i can't go into specifics, but we are currently experimenting with a load-balanced multi-server setup that i've spend the last couple of days putting together
<AttackWithHugs> Scoot-Scootaloo, did you really write Derpy Whooves?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So we get a nice president, but the economy might still suffer especially when we hit the fiscal cliff soon. If we don't fix that, hello double-dip recession.
<sub06905> dat maid outfit
<VenHur> "So much waiting that the old Narrator got tired of waiting so they had to bring a new one." I lol'ed.
<Tovler|Cry> Now to force Obama to decriminalize all drugs and force marriage equally… j/k we'll let the republicans control politics.
<otakon> it's SULLIED!
<otakon> SULLIED I SAY!
<dingus> Obama is a weak president but a better choice than Romney
<Time> Soup
<hen3ry> And the Tea Party types are crazy enough to want to go off the cliff. Figuring, hey, Obama will get blammed by history either way.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Disregard that post everyone! I didn't know US of A don't like it when you take a picture of a ballot!
<weeping_pegasi82> little brother saw spongebob now he's breathing over my shoulder
<Time> :D
<thelonepony> weeping_pegasi82: tell him i say hi :D
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: it's only a matter of time til the other countries (mainly china) say "Oh Herro, we want our money prease"
<Shizuka> 13democrats will take the senate, house is still barely coming in
<hen3ry> But to be fair, had Romney won, we'd still have gridlock, it'd just be the Senate we were talking about being the gridlock source.
<eddmario> Doesn't matter who wins. We're still fucked.
<fluttercry> 05,15America has voted for a black president AN historic first second time
<Shizuka> 13white guilt works
<Midnight_Fyre> Shizuka: Dems already have the senate. Reps will keep the house
<Buytoast> it's the end of all
<Jezebel> so.... did the GOP win anything?
<weeping_pegasi82> thelonepony: he had no idea what I was talking about he's barely 2 :D
<hen3ry> Jezebel: the House.
<thelonepony> weeping_pegasi82: oh :D

<StudMuffin> fluttercry: how? popular vote count everyone's vote
<hen3ry> Kurra: That's why I support monarchy
<picasso> i don't
<Shizuka> 13virginia's gotten closer, florida will go obama, colorado too
<thelonepony> Hi Friday :)
<Shizuka> 13StudMuffin: if it was a national popular vote, why would anywhere other than the big cities matter
<Kurra> hen3ry aw heck no D:
*Friday Movie Night: in 2 days, 19 hours, 16 minutes.
<fluttercry> 05,15StudMuffin because then the big cities and large population states would hold ALL the power. The small states wouldn't matter
<taoumi> i may have bit off more then i can chew w/ these two lunas
<Tovler|Cry> Obama's leading in Virgina
<Time> I think the stream stopped.
<weeping_pegasi82> anyone of you ever heard of JoaftheLoaf?
<otakon> it did
<Shizuka> 13there are eight million people in new york city alone and overwhelmingly democrat, why would you bother campaigning in the rest of new york?
<thelonepony> Time: no streamatm
<Jezebel> there's no possible way Romney can win now
<HoodyNinja> fluttercry: So, everything would stay the same?
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: because, big cities dont matter in the popular vote. it count eveeryones vote. if your talking about where the rpesidents would campaign, well, they still dotn campaign in California and Texas
<hen3ry> Shizuka: because we're a 50-50 country, so the votes matter nationally. It'd be a matter of turnout.
<Shizuka> 13no see
<Shizuka> 13big cities would have to be offset by a hell of a lot more small cities
<AttackWithHugs> Hmmm
<Shizuka> 13and they wouldn't
<VenHur> I can see those suckers booing at Obama now...those poor ashamed maggots...
<donutpop365> Oh hay, my internet is being silly, and I ought to be doing work things. G'night everypony.
<fluttercry> 05,15StudMuffin you don't understand. The vote of the big cities would overwhelm everyone else
<AttackWithHugs> I s'pose I could clean the fan in my laptop Thursday-ish
<thelonepony> Night donutpop365 :)
<Shizuka> 13we are not a democracy, we are a republic
<VenHur> See ya DonutPop365.

<Twilight> I heard I have a theater!
<Shizuka> 13picasso: because not everyone has internet
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: The presidents dont campaign aat all pretty much in California, because its mostly demorcatic. Obama knew he would win california. so he didnt go there, or at least very little. Romney probably did the same thing with texas
<thelonepony> Hi Twilight :)
<CriticKitten> StudMuffin: Big cities votes would overpower the small cities vastly. >_> EC allows small cities to have a say in the race, and it keeps the elections at the STATE level as they should be.
<hen3ry> Big cities have a distinctive elective pattern. A very deep blue core, surrounded by a red ring of suburbs, then often a bluish ring of exurbs.
<Tovler|Cry> Since Romney won the popular vote, maybe we can finally get rid of the electoral college.
<Twilight> :) Hi
<Shizuka> 13StudMuffin: exactly, instead they spend time in STATES with more distributed populations
<picasso> homeless people don't vote
<Shizuka> 13seriously?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord well it seems twilight is ban evaiding
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: if they did popular vote, theyd have to reason to go to EVERY state, not just Ohio and Florida
<hen3ry> 80% of the country had no say whatsoever in who won tonight.
<Buytoast> that's not true picasso
<Shizuka> 13StudMuffin: no they wouldn't, they would hit the big population centers and be done
<CriticKitten> Shizu: It's like I said. The folks who want the EC gone don't understand why it exists or what it does for us.
<Twilight> #Twilight Motha Effin Sparkle is here!
<Sad_face> hay every poney
<Shizuka> 13if you secure the population sinks, you win
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: no, they wouldnt
<Buytoast> why earlier today, on the subway, this homles man was writing OBAMA on the subway walls in merker
<Shizuka> 13no candidate would ever have to care about small towns again

<CriticKitten> Yes, they would.
<Ponies47> Hello Sad_face
<thelonepony> Hi Sad_face
<hen3ry> Only people who lived in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, etc. New York, Texas, California = worthless.
<Kurra> the thing is, you can spend a million dollars campaigning in any town or city in any state. Why spend that million in a town of 15,000 when you can spend it in a city of 1 million? See, big city swayings.
<HoodyNinja> They don't now
<RawketLawnchair> Twilight ? You aren't Twilight.
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: they dont right now with the EC
<Shizuka> 13and if you can't see the simple math, you have no business advocating abolition of the electoral college
<CriticKitten> Why would you visit a small town if you can secure New York City and thus take the entire state?
<picasso> now its exceeding my reading ability
<Shizuka> 13what you SHOULD be advocating is the abolition of winner take all
<Kurra> hen3ry EXCUSE ME? >:|
<Sad_face> obama won gary johns never stood a chance i know but y obama
<Twilight> Silly I'm Twilight Velvet!
<Shizuka> 13more states need to follow nebraska and maine where the electors are split by district
<Jezebel> kinda amazing that newyork voted
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: 1st amendemt, freedom of speech. I am not saying that whta you think is wrong, or stupid. Dont get me wrong Shizuka. But i think it should
<Sad_face> yes
<RawketLawnchair> Twilight Velvet? That doesn't make sense.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Agreed, winner-take-all rules are idiotic. Electors should be based by region.
<Jezebel> after being slammed by a hurricane
<hen3ry> Kurra: No matter who the candidates were, Texas was going to go red, California was going to go blue. No reason to even bother voting.
<Ponies47> I'm wearing pony shirts to school for the rest of the week in honor of Season 3 coming out on Saturday :P
<hen3ry> in 2016, Texas will be red, California will be blue.
<Twilight> I'm the mother OF twilight.

<VenHur> Don't fuck with Obama, bitches. http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Obama+2012_3a43e5_4074045.jpg
<Shizuka> 13alternative vote would be nice but there's no way that would overcome the inertia of one vote one candidate
<Kurra> hen3ry, it matters more than ever. <3
<hen3ry> Doesn't matter who runs.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: See if you can find any bronies there if you do. :)
<SpeccyRush> oh lovely
<pony_666> 1000 electoral votes seperated by population
<HoodyNinja> Ponies47: Different ones, I presume?
<StudMuffin> Ponies47: thats aweosme

<Sad_face> no poney song is working any advice i need some chearing up smile smile smile didt work
<RawketLawnchair> You are a silly person.
<Twilight> ...
<hen3ry> If you want to choose who the President is, move to Ohio or Florida.
<thelonepony> VenHur: lol
<Ponies47> HoodyNinja, Duh. I have 5 pony shirts :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Under Twilight?
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: do you think Romney went to Sacremento? Did Obama go to Houston?
<Twilight> Well your just a, a, a chair!

<HoodyNinja> Ponies47: Sweetness
<Shizuka> 13romney came to minnesota
<Shizuka> 13that would never happen if there was a popular vote
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome, I hope atleast one
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: im guessing thats where you live

<Ponies47> sub06905, I am silly :3

<hen3ry> In a popular system, they'd distribute more - they'd have to.
<hen3ry> You can only raise NYC's turnout so much.
<Shizuka> 13no they wouldn't
<VenHur> Twilight's favorite book is...The Wonderbook.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did the ban improperly.
<StudMuffin> Shizuka: you knwo, people from the small cities could just drive tot he big cities
<VenHur> ...U MAD?

<Sad_face> i need a muffen'
<hen3ry> Increasing turnout in rural Kansas might not be as easy as flying in for a quick visit, but it's a lot cheaper to buy airtime in those markets than it is in NYC, LA, Houston, etc.
<Ponies47> RawketLawnchair, Because I can :P
<sub06905> Ponies47: you should link me a picture of that shirt, it sounds cute :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seemed right for me missed an * or something ?
<VenHur> Because they're really that dumb Nittany, or they been sleeping in caves...
<RawketLawnchair> Ponies47: I implore you to reconsider.
<VenHur> ...Your choice.
<StudMuffin> fluttercry: No, but i watch eough politics and hear about it. Although i amy be biased I was raised at a young age by Republican parents and a Republican commmunity. So idk, maybe im just ignorant.
<DerpyMuffins> Obama won because Romney got cocky
<Sad_face> going omegal
<AJIsAwesome> RawketLawnchair: Reconsider doind what?
<CriticKitten> At present, it's looking like the final tally is....

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh wait *@* goes first
<RawketLawnchair> So you think.
<AJIsAwesome> RawketLawnchair: It may be silly to you, but not to others.
<Kurra> StudMuffin, doesn't matter what party you grew up with.
<StudMuffin> Maybe i am wrong. But 2 peoeple telling me that isnt enough to change my mind
<HoodyNinja> Ponies47: same :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. nick@host.
<StudMuffin> Kurra: im talking about not liking Obama
<VenHur> While I don't care about polictics sometimes, I had a strong heart for this beautful nation we lived in...
<Tovler|Cry> screw e3. I want to go to netroots next year.
<Kurra> yeah, and your party doesn't matter.
<VenHur> ...And it's fond history.
<Kurra> whatever it is.
<CriticKitten> 203 for Romney and 316 or so for Obama, assuming all polls conclude as they are now.
<HoodyNinja> VenHur: Of violence
<StudMuffin> Kurra: Republican. Although i didnt really care for Romney either
<StudMuffin> CriticKitten: isnt Ohio and Flordia still voting?
<Kurra> See beyond parties, and I don't like Obama or Romney. And I don't even like lots of what Clinton did in his time, though he is pretty bawss and a neat thinker.
*Tovler|Cry keeps saying Jon Huntsman over and over again.
<VenHur> Speaking of E3...GIMME MUH STARFOX AND F-ZERO NINTENDO, OR BITCHES BE MAD.
<sub06905> Ponies47: well at least you dont get constantly asked by students or sometimes teachers why you wear pony shirts

<Kurra> Well, I like ROmney and Obama in certain things
<CriticKitten> Florida's close, as is Virginia, but both are leaning for Obama
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: :D
<Shizuka> 13ohio still has early votes and absentees to work out, but romney's too far behind now
<Kurra> just, I look so much more at ther character....
<sub06905> Ponies47: :D
<CriticKitten> Nevada's leaning Obama and so is Wisconsin.
<picasso> don't like parties?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: That's not cotton candy, Derpy. :D

<StudMuffin> not homeless, jobless
<Ponies47> sub06905, My typing class teacher saw it and looked at me like O_o and then I just said yeah. Then she saw my Google Chrome theme which is Fluttershy ._.
<CriticKitten> And if the polls conclude as is, then it's pretty much established that Obama has a solid win now.
<DeadpoolDash> ohio is a statistical dead heat now
<CriticKitten> He might've won even more than he did against McCain....
<HoodyNinja> Ponies47: Dis mah fav :3 http://www.redbubble.com/people/ak71/works/7872232-im-special
<Shizuka> 13i don't have the numbers on hand but i'm sure even if romney took ohio and virginia and florida now he still wouldn't catch up

<sub06905> http://www.motherearthnews.com/uploadedImages/articles/online_articles/2006-10-01/peaches2_resized400X266.jpg
<Marx> Welp, Dems need 1 more seat and they're have Senate majority.
<Deadlypon3> I had to complete the pseudo code part of it and had to promise that I will turn in the chart portion on thursday
<Lunar_Brony> When I last saw, it was 50/48. What is it now?
<AttackWithHugs> I guess?
<Shizuka> 13so trump was unconscious for 2000 i guess
<Avocadovler> Donald is now Dolan to me
<J_E_Smith71> Even though Romney won't win he still won't give up until Ohio comes in
<Marx> It appears Reps will keep the House though.
<DeadpoolDash> romney shouldnt give up until the absentees come in
<HoodyNinja> Love his reaction
<Shizuka> 13even if he manages to take ohio he's still done
<HoodyNinja> "Oh no, they didn't get the guy I liked, this nation is in ruins!"
<Avocadovler> VA and FL have only gotten wider.
<HoodyNinja> Everything is broken!
<Saturn> 08,01wait, obama won?
<Midnight_Fyre> yep
<J_E_Smith71> He needs 87 or 88 votes
<Jmo> Wasn't it obvious enough?
<HoodyNinja> Sounds like the average 10 yr old cod player
<HoodyNinja> Obama lost and S3 is cancelled
<Kurra> NOOOOO
<HoodyNinja> Episode 3 will never be made
<Buytoast> "FUK U XXX_BR0B4M4_XXX, STOP VOTE CAMPIN U NOOB"
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Yep he did 290-203
<DerpyMuffins> Cya everypony
<Avocadovler> Now that Disney is uncertain about the markets, They won't purchase Hasbro.
<HoodyNinja> And Gabe Newell took your lunch
<Midnight_Fyre> Pretty sure it's already made
<thelonepony> bye DerpyMuffins :)
<HoodyNinja> latas Derpy_Hooves
<NocturnalBlade> bye DerpyMuffins
<HoodyNinja> DerpyMuffins*
<Yahooz> http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83450.html This is hilarious
<Kencolt> HoodyNinja: And were Mr. Romney to have won, the vast majority of the Left-- and a fair chunk of the press-- would have reacted eactly the same.
<VenHur> Saturn: Yeah, he woned...again.
<HoodyNinja> Yahooz: Too late
<Midnight_Fyre> Yahooz: :D
<AJIsAwesome> Night, DerpyMuffins. :)
<HoodyNinja> Kencolt: Exactly
<Shizuka> 13if romney won the media would have gone into shock
<Yahooz> oh, Derpy_Hooves beat me too it :L
<Shizuka> 13as it is they're just creaming themselves that they got obama elected again
<HoodyNinja> All but Fox
<Kencolt> More than a few political students-- conservative and liberal -- agre that the Elctorial College needs re-examination.
<Yahooz> Fox b mad
<Shizuka> 13winner take all needs to end
<Shizuka> 13but it won't
<Yahooz> because people are dumb
<Kencolt> Fox isn't mad. In fact, Fox is merely saying, "Looks like Obama won."
<Shizuka> 13there's states looking to get together to form a "national popular vote", where these states agree to give their electoral votes to whoever wins popular vote in aggregate
<Avocadovler> Jon Huntsman, and you should have Ross Perot'd the Green or Justice Party.
<Kurra> Whoa no way Shizuka!
<Avocadovler> Only Gary Johnson was on my ballot.
<Shizuka> 13or so says dad anyway, he's more willing to keep on top of politics than i am
<HoodyNinja> Oh hey this discussion again

<Lunar_Brony> So . . . I just read the newsletter. "How To Train Your Dragon"
<twoiloight_spurnkle> yay :D
<AJIsAwesome> I thought your name was Dolanized, twoiloight_spurnkle. :D
<Lunar_Brony> being a fan of the book series, the movie is disapoint
<siddelthekiddel> And I drew Fluttershy today! :) And they all look like they have insanley short legs...

<sub06905> the*
<Lunar_Brony> and by that, I mean I HATE IT!! This is the 2nd movie I've seen based off a book (or book series) that I adore and completely f*cks it up.
<tehlonpon> fak teh rules
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> moo
<Jmo> . . .
<siddelthekiddel> *cough* Percy Jackson *cough*
<tehlonpon> :>
<Kurra> moo.
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel exactly
<weeping_pegasi82> meow?
<siddelthekiddel> Lunar_Brony: They could have done so much with that book. At least they did a pretty good job with the Hunger Games.
<thelonepony> bark im a turtle :3
<Kimori> I'm still real tired, been moving all day, will be continuing tomorrow.
<weeping_pegasi82> woof I'm a duck
<AdamTheDuck> Meow
<AJIsAwesome> Baa!
<weeping_pegasi82> neigh!
<siddelthekiddel> Who here would like to be a tree? :o
<Afflict[phone]> ah
<weeping_pegasi82> ME!
<thelonepony> i would love to be a tree~
<thelonepony> tree~
<weeping_pegasi82> actually nevermind being a tree would be boring
<thelonepony> now i want to hear that song again
<siddelthekiddel> Guys. Altair or Ezio?
<siddelthekiddel> :
<siddelthekiddel> :3
<weeping_pegasi82> you would just sit there doing nothing
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel "The Hunger Games" was . . . /decent/. I don't like how they treat the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. In the book, she clearly states she doesn't really love him. In the movie, I didn't get that message. And don't even get me started on Katniss herself...
<thelonepony> ezio for the most part
<AdamTheDuck> Neither, Pinkie Pie.
<Afflict[phone]> im gonna go to bed, night
<weeping_pegasi82> Lunar_Brony: how do you feel about Eragon? :P
<siddelthekiddel> Lunar_Brony: Well, they always have that issue. The Hunger Games gave you the view through Katniss herself, and she never really said out loud that she didn't love Peeta. One thing that will complicate things is how she got the Mockingjay pin...it was a LOT different in the book.
<siddelthekiddel> thelonepony: I personally prefer Ezio, never played AC I, but Altair just...LOOKS boring-er?
<Lunar_Brony> weeping_pegasi82 never read the book, forgot everything about the movie.
<sub06910> bah
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel:
<Lunar_Brony> oops
<sub06910> what was that ghost command again?
<weeping_pegasi82> Lunar_Brony: well don't it's all travelling and the movie ugh the movie
<AdamTheDuck> /ns username password
<AdamTheDuck> oops
<Kimori> same, was just checking in, night
<AdamTheDuck> I mean /ns ghost username password

<AdamTheDuck> Spike_is_Bestpony, /)
<sub06905> ...
<sub06905> no Blueblood is :3
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel Katniss doesn't display her emotions very well in the movie. I remember watching the trailer; specifcally the reaping. Katniss . . . ugh, it makes me cringe just thinking about that scene.
<thelonepony> No crackle is :V
<Lunar_Brony> weeping_pegasi82 I never planned on it, so yeah :p
<Spike_is_Bestpony> No, Spike is Bestpony
<thelonepony> Crackle
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> moo
<AdamTheDuck> Tom.
<Spike_is_Bestpony> moo?
<AdamTheDuck> Moo.
<Saturn> 08,01bitch, please
<siddelthekiddel> Lunar_Brony: Yeah...I'm really curious how they are gonna play it out when they make Catching Fire. A lot of things they didn't add in the first movie will kick them in the head. Although, I have to say that Jennifer Lawrence is a better Katniss than a Jennifer Lawrence... :3
<Saturn> 08,01discord is best pony
<Spike_is_Bestpony> Discord is Notpony
<siddelthekiddel> Discords more of a pony than spike is.
<thelonepony> well he's part pony
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn is best Saturn \:3/
<siddelthekiddel> xD
<Saturn> 08,01\o/
<Spike_is_Bestpony> But Spike is Bestpony, I didn't say anything about spike /being/ a pony
<siddelthekiddel> You have to be a pony to be the best pony.
<siddelthekiddel> :3
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel hehe, dat true man. I hope they also solve the camera shake problem. It's difficult to focus on a single scene because the camera's bobbing everywhere.
<thelonepony> siddelthekiddel: i'm a pony :3
<Spike_is_Bestpony> Yest, to be the best pony you need to be a pony. But to be Bestpony you have to be Spike.
<thelonepony> <see :3
<Lunar_Brony> I see what you did thar.
<siddelthekiddel> Lunar_Brony: Yeah. I still loved the movie, just not from a skeptical point of view. Part of me wanted to kill the directors for not adding Madge. xD And the other part wanted to chill and enjoy a movie.
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU herro
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> KILL YOU FAMLY
<Buytoast> goddamn

<Lunar-geeky-gaming> thelonepony: moo
<thelonepony> Bark
<Spike_is_Bestpony> How are the streams on bronystate? I'm new here.
<thelonepony> :3
<Lunar_Brony> siddelthekiddel stand alone, the movie is pretty good. It is very rare for me to find a movie based off a book in which I liked the movies more . . . except LOTR. J.R. Tolkein wrote the damn books in blocks that go on and on and on and on.. that make it impossible for me to read the stupid book.
<Saturn> 08,01?/?
<Lunar_Brony> Spike_is_Bestpony they're awesome
<sub06905> stream!
<Spike_is_Bestpony> Much lag on them?
<Lunar_Brony> slowpoke sub06905
<thelonepony> Spike_is_Bestpony: some streamers will stream if they feal like it
<sub06905> :>
<siddelthekiddel> Lunar_Brony: So true! Lol. But yeah, they are gonna kick themselves for some of the things they didn't add.
<weeping_pegasi82> what's this?
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> moo
<Saturn> 08,01i am streaming some more Journeyman
<weeping_pegasi82> ah

<Spike_is_Bestpony> I don't get the Hub on campus and am trying figure out where/when I am going to watch
<thelonepony> Spike_is_Bestpony: Every friday we have BMN
<Spike_is_Bestpony> Basically I'm trying to figure out if I'm watching on youtube two hours after the show on saturday or watching the stream here
<thelonepony> Brony Movie night
<weeping_pegasi82> I don't get the hub luckily I have bronystate
<Lunar_Brony> ^

<Lunar-geeky-gaming> find mo mo
<Spike_is_Bestpony> Does the show get streamed while its airing?
<thelonepony> what show?
<Spike_is_Bestpony> That's what I'm curious about
<Saturn> 08,01thelonepony: come watch it here!
<Saturn> 08,01it'll be awesome
<sub06905> Press X to Dad
<Spike_is_Bestpony> MLP on saturday
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> sub06905: lol
<NocturnalBlade> Spike_is_Bestpony: yes it will be streamed here ^_^
<Lunar_Brony> Spike_is_Bestpony I'm in that position too. Over here, MLP starts at 7am, which means I'll need to be up at 6:30 if I want to be concious. If I decide to try and wake up, chances are I'm going to sub-conciously turn off my alarm clock and sleep in.
<thelonepony> yes sumi always stream episodes in the morning
<Lunar_Brony> As per usual . . .
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> Lunar_Brony: KABOOM
<Spike_is_Bestpony> I'm thinking of gathering a few people from different floors in my dorm and/or a few people from different dorms to watch
<thelonepony> Spike_is_Bestpony: for this week, we will have a MLP marathon after BMN
<Lunar_Brony> Lunar-geeky-gaming why did you type out an onomatopoeia?
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> Lunar_Brony: a what
<thelonepony> that will be a kickstarter for season 3
<Lunar_Brony> Lunar-geeky-gaming -_(\ sound word: ie buzz, flash, KABOOM
<XylemTube> TOTAL OBAMANATION
<Lunar-geeky-gaming> Lunar_Brony: ah
<Spike_is_Bestpony> The Hub really should stream ponies live with comercials the morning it airs - they would get more ad revenue that way =P
<sub06905> Lunar_Brony: looks like youll be needing an alarm clock like this: http://conmedisys.com/img/e0/e0f/World_s_Loudest_Alarm_Clock_.jpg
<Spike_is_Bestpony> I'll probably stop in some time tomorrow to ask more questions
<Spike_is_Bestpony> have fun tonight
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> did you hear obama won the election againts McCain's?
<thelonepony> Night Spike_is_Bestpony :)
<Lunar_Brony> sub06905 "World's Loudest Alarm Clock". Nah, I've had mine for over 7 years and it is loud and obnoxious. That god damned sound rings in my ears, over and over, like it's trying to wake the fucking dead.
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Spike_is_Bestpony

<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: that sucks :I
<Lunar_Brony> sub06905 well it kinda has to be loud to wake me in the morning. Middle of the night, fast asleep, one of my cousins punched me in the face because I snore loudly and talk in my sleep. I just moaned and rolled over.
<thelonepony> thats why i havent been on youtube when S3 was announce :P
<Lunar_Brony> +1 for Adblock Plus
<Lunar_Brony> and being paranoid on the internet . . .
<Lunar_Brony> and in life in general.
<sub06905> Lunar_Brony: you must be a heavy sleeper
<Lunar_Brony> sub06905 oooh yeah. Once I'm out, there is no chance in waking me up.
<Lunar_Brony> Unless someone yells in my ear and shines a fucking light in my face..
<sub06905> :D
<Lunar_Brony> *sigh* cousins.
<thelonepony> i know that feel
<thelonepony> everytime my cousins are over for the holidays...

<Jmo> You obviously aren't going to go far in life, so go sit in the corner and assess your life.
<Linux> we're not trolling, just insulting
<Jmo> Even if you can do that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Linux is right he is not even trolling
<Jmo> Your insults are pathetic and wortless, they're words.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also Linux you are the best operating system ever
<Jmo> The only people you are making angry or annoyed are the people who need to get a grip of the concept of the internet.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jmo concept ? internet ? what you talking about ?
<Jmo> If you're going to get butthurt over someone saying something to you, you obviously need to toughen up.
<Jmo> They're just words.
<XAX> Jmo: im hurtin u with werds go cry lel

<Jmo> I love peoples reactions when they see my list.
<Jmo> Tis gold.
<TheRandomkid321> God pokemon B&W 2 was a massive rip. FIve minutes in and they force you to do so much. Just about everything's scripted nowadays! I don't want to bopther going an extra, pointless few steps to find my friend I want to just have him where he was supposed to be! (@#@)// ^|___
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jmo your backlog or your game list ?
<Jmo> Game list.
<Jmo> People still buy Pokemon? Wat is dis.
<TheRandomkid321> I just want to play Red Or Blue. Unchanged!
<RoboGerbil> im seeing a lot of chatter about pokemon black and white lately
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i still have my yellow version and my GB color
<TheRandomkid321> ROboGerbil Yeah because it's so sh#t. God Pokemon SUCKS nowadays!
<RoboGerbil> arent there over 1k pokemans now?
<Jmo> How long did it take for you to realise that?
<TheRandomkid321> I spent 60 dollers on that! Sixty bloody dollers! The reviews said it was good. Why did you lie critics?
<Moopy> Hey guys i love to stay up with yall a little bit more but i got to hit the hey myself so a see yall and talked to yall in the morning aight.........night guys
<Jmo> First mistake, believing critics.
<Phase4> 00,02i have a gb color, pokemon red and 2 copies of pokemon blue
<Jmo> Shove money in their mouths and they'll sing any song you want.
<RoboGerbil> lol it might be good if youre a lobotomized 8 yr old
<TheRandomkid321> I bought it out of nostalgia! WHAT HAPENED TO YOU POKEMON!
<RoboGerbil> TheRandomkid321: nintendo took it over?
<Phase4> 00,02RoboGerbil, they added pokemon
<Phase4> 00,02and then added some more
<Phase4> 00,02and more
<RoboGerbil> aww yeah my backhanded comment about nintendo
<Phase4> 00,02and i think you can see where this is going
<Jmo> Maybe they'll add more pokemon in the next one.
<Jmo> Just a hunch.
<RoboGerbil> pfft
<RoboGerbil> lies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> TheRandomkid321 dis happend basicly http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj359Gi4y7c
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 see same vid
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, on that note, the black and white legendaries, what are they?
<Jmo> Black and white.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno
<Jmo> cwatididthar.
*AdamTheDuck slaps Jmo around a bit with a bit of large trout
<Jmo> Oi
<RoboGerbil> Phase4: ones named whocares and the others whoplaysthiscrap
<Jmo> If only the pokemon fanboys were around.
<TheRandomkid321> God I hold in my hand the very game that should BE RETURNED TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL OF WHICH IT CAME!!!!!!!
*AdamTheDuck throws a muffin at TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> ADAM! TYOU SAID THIS GAME WAS GOOD! DID YOU NOT!?
<RoboGerbil> never say no to muffin
<AdamTheDuck> No, Gold Demona said that TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> Oh
<Jmo> BerryPunch, go home, you're drunk.
<Phase4> 00,02BerryPunch, now stop drinking :<
<Phase4> 00,02you have important job here
<AdamTheDuck> I said I stopped playing Pokemon at Ruby/Saphire.
<Jmo> She kicked 6 people before due to being drunk.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I thought the gen 5 legendary was Metal and nature
<RoboGerbil> just 6?
<Jmo> One after another.
<CrimsonPhoenix> or something about technology
<TheRandomkid321> DAMN THIS GODFORSAKEN GAME! I'VE SEEN 10 DOLLAR GAMES BOUGHT AT DISCOUNT STORES BETTER THAN YOU!
<JRP2234> Phase4 i won i won
<Jmo> umadbro?
<CrimsonPhoenix> So Obama is el presidente?
<Jmo> Correcto.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Coolio
<TheRandomkid321> When's the elction?
<Jmo> >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheRandomkid321, it's over
<TheRandomkid321> VERMIN SUPREME WON RIGHT :(
<Phase4> 00,02http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Reshiram_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<ImaScatmare> Indeed the Obama part is a cover up
<Phase4> 00,02appears that its just a dragon
<Phase4> 00,02http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zekrom_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29
<Phase4> 00,02this one too
<Jmo> DNA Splicers? What the fuck?
<TheRandomkid321> I should bury this game... then burn it...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 zekrom and its counterpart Reshiram are based on the concept of yin and yang- wikipedia
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, so... they're just dragons except theres two of them
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it seems like it
<MadSurge> Phase4: there's the two mandatory dragons, a fusion of them, three (really four) elemental deer things, a pyrokinectic ferret, a sreel caterpillar thing, three wind gods
<TheRandomkid321> I should have saved my money instead of buying this game... where's Gold_Demona I want to have a talk with 'er!
<Jmo> You can't blame others for your mistakes.
<MadSurge> *steel
<Jmo> You made the decision yourself.
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo My decision was based on Gold_Demonas opiniion.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still your fault
<Jmo> That is your fault.
<Phase4> 00,02perhaps if they had stopped increasing the number of legendaries per generation
<EspyLacopa|2> So, how come the bronystate site still doesn't define A movie and B movie in an objective way, so as to remove the arguements on whether the picks are or arent?
<Phase4> 00,02could have been reasonable til the 6th
<MadSurge> Phase4: aye, they seem to break the game :D
<Jmo> So, don't you dare even try going and blaming it on her for your own mistake.
<Phase4> 00,02EspyLacopa, how do you define that objectively
<EspyLacopa> I thought I heard something about basing it off RottenTomatoes.
<MadSurge> Phase4: I liked though that you can't import Pokemons until you complete the storyline of the game
<AdamTheDuck> EspyLacopa, pfft, t'is only BrownieStaet tradition for one to get their movie lottery vote rejected at least once in one's lifetime.
<TheRandomkid321> Fine... Jmo you have a point... only one man can get rid of this god forsaken thing for me... but I owe him money...
<Jmo> Quit being down over a game as well.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> next time try a game instead of blindly beliving in opinions and reviews
<TheRandomkid321> This is not just a game. It's the worst game i've ever seen... and it's POKEMON!
*AdamTheDuck has seen worse.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes yes i get it you miss the old ones like the most
<Jmo> Quit your complaining and go kick a ball outside already. Jeez.
<TheRandomkid321> It's 9:30 pm
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> or finish your game and then sell it
<Jmo> Oh. That's right. You're an Australian as well.
<TheRandomkid321> Sell it? Why do you think i'm so cruel as to pass this onto another human being?
<EspyLacopa> Think this network is ready for the premiere this saturday?
<Jmo> It has been made to be reay.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sell it to the game store for credit ?
<Jmo> Tech-heads were working on it around the clock.
<Jmo> Ask Phase4 or Saturn.
*AdamTheDuck tugs on Phase4, may you do the honours?
<Jmo> ready*
<TheRandomkid321> Wait.. the premiers on this week? Oh god I wasnt preparEd!
<JRP2234> Saturn do you have your rings on?

<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
<CrimsonPhoenix> If MLP season 3 wasn't enough
<Gold_Demona> My mac is in the shop and is being fixed. :3
<Gold_Demona> Yey
<Jmo> How much did it cost?
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Gold_Demona
<trollhunter> hey gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: The repair is estimated at about 170, which is way better than I was expecting.
<Jmo> >____>
<Jmo> I wouldn't even
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Apparently the graphic chip went bad
<JRP2234> Blocks placed: 66188
<JRP2234> Blocks broken: 52341
<Jmo> Ah
<Jmo> Makes sense
<Gold_Demona> It went splodey and decided it don't work no more
<Gold_Demona> So mac store will put in new one for me. And reinstall OSX in the process because I asked them to.
<Jmo> Fairo.
<Jmo> Glad you're getting it fixed.
<Gold_Demona> Me too! I like having a second computer. ^^
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Gold_Demona
*AdamTheDuck still doesn't the benefit of having 2 computers .-.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah BACKGROUND PONY 18,19,20 SOOOOOOON AWWW SHIT I'M HYPE
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Phase4 =D
<AdamTheDuck> doesn't see the *
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I can be in the chat on one computer and play a game on the other
<Jmo> Adam, you can't see anything.
<Jmo> Blind duck >_>
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, steam for linux beta
<Phase4> 00,02is out
<JRP2234> 24x Xeon Cores • 96 GB of DDR3 RAM • 6x OCZ Agility 3 SSD's • 2x 1TB SAS Disks for Backups
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: I don't know how to linux. o_o
<Phase4> 00,02i have (via bug, didnt actually get beta access)
<Phase4> 00,02is good, smoother than on windows
<trollhunter> goodbye bronystate
<AdamTheDuck> Bye trollhunter
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but don't you need to know hacking stuff to do anything in linux?
<Gold_Demona> Or am I thinking of unix?
<Jmo> I'd love to see comparison charts before believing that.
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, not really, ubuntu is easier to install (and imho use) than windows
<Phase4> 00,02don't need to know any more than on windows
<Gold_Demona> I don't mean the installation. I mean actually using it
<Jmo> Strong bold on IMHO
<JRP2234> Phase4 24x Xeon Cores • 96 GB of DDR3 RAM • 6x OCZ Agility 3 SSD's • 2x 1TB SAS Disks for Backups is this good andrew?
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, uh... that is a compute server, not sure what you'd need that for
<Gold_Demona> Thing is I like being able to see the stream AND the chat and still be able to play full screen games.
<Jmo> Before anyone thinks it, I'm not hating on linux.
<Gold_Demona> Also skype
<Gold_Demona> And internet
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, just get two monitors and then play the game in borderless windowed mode
<Gold_Demona> I use PC for games, and I use mac for everything else
<JRP2234> city fighter and submarine invasion
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Not all games have that tho
<Jmo> Adam, shh. personal preference.
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, multiple desktops make that kind of multitasking trivial
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769
<AdamTheDuck> ^ that's what I use .-.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Not all my games are on steam
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I have games that are older than steam
<JRP2234> Phase4 make me a midi driver that i can use sounds fonts with
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, don't have emperical evidence of it being faster, cbf getting any either
<Jmo> Can't Dema just do stuff the way she likes it :<
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, it will still work unless the game can't run in windowed mode.
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, uh, theres several already
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Some of them can't.
<Jmo> Will you stink Phase4 :P
<JRP2234> doom hates it
<Jmo> Well*
<Gold_Demona> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<JRP2234> Phase4 how tall are u?>
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, no idea
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, hopefully wine gets a few more developers, lots of older games actually work better under wine than new windows
<Gold_Demona> At any rate, this is the system that has worked for me.
<AdamTheDuck> Fair enough Gold_Demona :P
<Jmo> You got proof for that Phase? >.>
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, red alert 2, deus ex
<Jmo> Not proof like that .-.
<Phase4> 00,02former has performance problems, theres a project that ported the wine dll to windows
<Gold_Demona> It's especially useful when I'm playing games like SWTOR which eat up a LOT of memory. So multitasking is almost impossible on my PC when I play it.
<Phase4> 00,02works fine under wine, the latter crashes
<Phase4> 00,02on windows i meen
<Phase4> 00,02deus ex works fine on wine

<Hanako> delicious friend cola

<Bronysith> with flavor
<Bronysith> and when i say flavor, i mean grenadine
<Bronysith> and when i say grenadine
<Bronysith> i mean blood
<Hanako> I agree with you on coffee
<Hanako> except
<Hanako> it must also be as bitter as a lost love
<Hanako> wait shit, you got that part
<Bronysith> hotter
<Bronysith> and bitter
<Bronysith> like the depths of hell
<Hanako> Yeah
<Bronysith> THAT is coffee
<Gold_Demona> um...
<Bronysith> same with tea
<Bronysith> hot
<Gold_Demona> I like my coffee with LOTS of sugar and LOTS of cream. ^^
<Bronysith> no sugar
<LightTrooper105> food so many food o3o
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: but you are already sweet enough
<Gold_Demona> Lots and lots and lots of sugar
<Hanako> I drink tea with milk and sugar
<Bronysith> fuck that
<Hanako> Coffee black
<Hanako> and only black
<Gold_Demona> I can't stand black coffee. >__>
<Hanako> sometimes with a little sugar
<Bronysith> i just heat up water in the microwave for 1 minute, get my tea and then enjoy
<Gold_Demona> I HAVE to have milk and sugar in it
<Hanako> oh fuck no
*AdamTheDuck has to try black coffee some day >.<
<Hanako> I use a kettle for me tea
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Ponies47> No stream correct? :I
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Hanako> Heretic.
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, no stream. :/
<Gold_Demona> Correct Ponies47
<Jmo> Ponies47, go to school.
<Ponies47> Ah. Well then have some laughs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar08QK8cJ2I&feature=g-all-c :P
<Gold_Demona> Hanako: I drink my tea with no milk or sugar, if that makes me any better. :P
<Bronysith> i dont have a tea kettle ;__;
<Gold_Demona> Does that save me?
<Jmo> Ew.
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I don't have a tea kettle either. I use a colombian kettle. :D
<Hanako> Gold_Demona: Oh, that wasn't directed at you
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i like my tea bitter with a sweet treat on the side
<Gold_Demona> oh lol
<Hanako> That's just the way my family makes tea
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Although, I haven't yet had any of the teas that usually get milk and sugar added to them. :D
<Ponies47> Jmo, I don't have to be at school until 10:00 this week. Sophomores are taking some special testing this week :P
<Gold_Demona> Only green tea, some fruit teas, and some herbals.
<Bronysith> i dont see why people put milk with tea
<Bronysith> i just drink black tea
<Hanako> sugar and milk, use a proper kettle, a big mug (not a tiny little teacup)
<Bronysith> MOTHERFUCKER
<Hanako> Saucers are acceptable but not needed at all
<Bronysith> i prefer my tea in a little cup, more concentrated flavor
<Bronysith> saucer or coaster so i dont spill on my wooden table
<Hanako> Oh, we just use more tea
<Hanako> it's still quite strong
<Gold_Demona> I don't get what the difference is between using an open top kettle and a proper tea kettle. The tea making happens in the mug when I make tea. =/
<Hanako> There isn't one, it's tradition
<Bronysith> ZONDER
*Ponies47 Doesn't like tea
<Hanako> Also
<Gold_Demona> I prefer coffee myself, but the teas I drink are better for me.
<Bronysith> Ponies47: out
<Hanako> The boiling itself is a part of enjoying the tea
<Ponies47> Bronysith, You first ^^
<Gold_Demona> I like using my colombian kettle. :3
<Bronysith> chicken fried steak, eggs, buttery biscuit, smothered in gravy
<Bronysith> that is a good breakfast
<Bronysith> right now my jacket smells like sausage...
<Bronysith> I LOVE IT
<Hanako> Everyone around here drinks their coffee with all this creamer shit in it
<Hanako> disgusting
<Bronysith> Hanako: ikr
<Bronysith> if i wanted a sweet coffee, id get a frappucino at star bucks
<Hanako> Also, sausage gravy and biscuits
<Bronysith> i cant drink sweet hot stuff...except hot chocolate
<Bronysith> Hanako: /)
<Hanako> (\
<Bronysith> at this one hotel, the buffet
<Bronysith> my god the buffet, i had like 13 strips of bacon, eggs, biscuit and all covered in deliciuos gravy
<Bronysith> in one sitting
<Hanako> Oh, I can't eat much
<Bronysith> honestly though Sausage patties>bacon
<Hanako> but I always eat well to make up for it
<Hanako> Yeah, sausage is way better
<Bronysith> im a 6,5 motherfucker
<Bronysith> i need my fill
<Bronysith> and i have to drink like double the normal amount of water in a day as everyone else
<Bronysith> so i dont dehydrate
*Hanako 5'5, usually 115lbs at the most
<Bronysith> i weigh 180
<Bronysith> Hanako: you tiny
<Bronysith> everyone tiny
*Hanako nods
<Hanako> All this talk of good food and I'm sick :\
<Bronysith> Hanako: eat something uber spicy then
<Hanako> can't even have any ;-;
<Hanako> Can't be done, spiciest thing in the house is my personal bottle of Tobasco
<Gold_Demona> I'm about to have softboiled eggs and toast
<Bronysith> hard boiled eggs better
<Hanako> ^
<Bronysith> and then sunny side up kicks all those asses
<Hanako> with salt
<Bronysith> no salt
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I prefer softboiled eggs for breakfast. Hardboiled are best as snacks
<Bronysith> ranch or super spicy wing sauce
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: healthy snack, as it has the same effect as celery
<Hanako> sunny side up with salt, pepper, and a slice of bread
<Hanako> Scrambled with baught but tobasco
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: It has negative calories?
<Hanako> *naught
<Bronysith> i dont like toast
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: yea
<Hanako> Not toast
<Hanako> bread
<Bronysith> i dont like just plain bread
<Hanako> to wipe up the yolk :3
<Bronysith> i just lick it up
<Gold_Demona> I like to dip my toast in the softboiled eggs. :3
<Bronysith> you know, HOW you are supposed to clean yolk
<Bronysith> by licking it off the plate
<Hanako> By eating it
<Hanako> It's the best part
<Gold_Demona> I use my spoon to scrape up the yoke myself. When I have no more toast.
<Bronysith> i dont like toast for breakfast
<Hanako> ...
<Bronysith> unless its french toast or texas toast
*Hanako *really* wants some eggs now
<Gold_Demona> You're weird, Bronysith. :P
<Bronysith> or stuffed french toast with strawberries
*Hanako concurs with Bronysith
<Gold_Demona> As far as breakfast goes, my favorites are softboiled eggs and over easy.
<Hanako> over easy is cool too
<Gold_Demona> Favorite types of eggs
<Bronysith> scrambled is decent
<Bronysith> that goes best with gravy really
<Gold_Demona> I like hardboiled eggs as a snack, but not as breakfast.
<Gold_Demona> Not really a fan of hard yoke. =/
<Hanako> I only like scrambled with something else or tobasco
<Gold_Demona> Scrambled comes a close second on the favorites
<Hanako> It's just meh on its own
<Bronysith> ZONDER
<Gold_Demona> I make my scrambled eggs with a little bit of milk to make them super fluffy. :3
<AdamTheDuck> Time to hit the hay.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone. :)
<Hanako> why do you keep saying that
<Jmo> Night Adam
<Gold_Demona> Night AdamTheDuck
<Bronysith> final fusion...
<Bronysith> APPROVED
<Bronysith> final fusion. PROGRAM DRIVE
<Bronysith> my god, final fusion is the sexiest transformation sequence since sailor moon
<Bronysith> i love this anime
<Hanako> what are you even watching
<Bronysith> GaoGaiGar
<Bronysith> one of the best giant mech animes i have ever seen
<Bronysith> i think i like it better than Gurren Lagann
<Hanako> Oh, good on you
<flamewingdiablo15> are yall excited for season 3 of MLP?
<Hanako> >better than gurren lagann
<Hanako> ...
*Hanako alllows it.
<Bronysith> flamewingdiablo15: why? so i can be disapointed ?
<Hanako> *allows
<Hanako> Yeah, don't care about S3 at all
<Hanako> if it's decent, okay
<Bronysith> flamewingdiablo15: every brony ever is somewhat excited for S3, except me, cause disapointed
<Hanako> if it's not, meh
<Bronysith> seriously, with that disapointing finale
<Hanako> I stopped caring some times after the S2 opening episodes
<Hanako> *time
<Gold_Demona> I'm looking forward to it, but I can't really say I'm excited.
<Bronysith> the only reason people like the season 2 finale is because This day aria and fight scene
<Bronysith> other than that it is your average disney story line...and mediocre at that
<flamewingdiablo15> well im lookin forward to it too but alot of other bronies say their excited for it
<Gold_Demona> DAMMIT, I forgot to set the timer! T^T
<Gold_Demona> I don't know how long I've been boiling these things! ><
<Hanako> You mean This Spaghetti Aria?
<Bronysith> seriously, that fight scene in s2 finale was completely pointless
<Bronysith> "only i can open the vault where the elements are stored...you must go there without me"
<Bronysith> /)_=
<Bronysith> even if they made it there, they wouldnt have been able to open it
<flamewingdiablo15> sorry if this changes conversations but whose your fav pony on the show
<Bronysith> i friggin hate supposed to lose battles in RPGs so thats why i hate that fight scene
<Gold_Demona> It's a children's show Bronysith. Plot holes abound.
<Rommulus> Hello everypony
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: im a writer, i hate plotholes so much and i neeeeed consistency
<Bronysith> "consuming your love has made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "o you trying to get power with love? yea that wont work" /)_=
<Bronysith> thank you, worst villain ever
<Bronysith> well i am off to college, see you guys later
<Hanako> bye
<flamewingdiablo15> later bronysith
<Gold_Demona> That's another one who complains too much
<Jmo> Who?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith
<Jmo> Oh there's alot I could say about him.
<Gold_Demona> Which is why it's always "fun" when he and randomkid are in here at the same time.
<Jmo> :P
<Gold_Demona> I'm nota happy dema now...
<Jmo> Aww, why? :<
<Gold_Demona> Cuz I ruined my eggs due to lack of timer and having NOT looked at the time when I put the eggs in to boil. T^T
<Jmo> Ahh.
<Gold_Demona> They didn't cook long enough...
<Jmo> tsk tsk.
<Gold_Demona> I HATE making mistakes like that
<Jmo> Silly dema :P
<Gold_Demona> It really upsets me. T^T
<Gold_Demona> I mean seriously.
<Jmo> I blame browniestate :P
<Gold_Demona> T^T
<Gold_Demona> And I don't have enough eggs to try again...
<Jmo> D:
<Gold_Demona> Need enough eggs to make my husband's breakfast the rest of the week.
<Jmo> Poor dema.
<Gold_Demona> So now I'm left with two pieces of toast and nothing to eat them with. :<
<Gold_Demona> [first world problems]
<Jmo> Indeed.
<Jezebel> feels good watching boondocks episodes...
<Gold_Demona> The only other breakfast food I have is cereal...
<Jezebel> can't wait for the new Megasxlr
<Jmo> What type of cereal?
<Gold_Demona> honey nut cheerios
<Jmo> Interesting >.>
<Gold_Demona> I like it, but it wasn't what I wanted... And it's not a proper companion for toast...
<Gold_Demona> [spoiled brat first world problems]
<Jmo> O U Dema.
<Gold_Demona> I'll just eat the damn toast and have cereal when I'm done.
<Jmo> Gruumpy demaaa~
<Gold_Demona> And probably by lunchtime I'll get over it. :P
<Jmo> You will indeed.
<MadSurge> :O Gold_Demona! *hugs*
<Gold_Demona> ohai MadSurge
<DashWithRainbows> You best not eat that toast
<Jmo> I hate you chav.
<Gold_Demona> DashWithRainbows: Why not? O-o
<Jmo> That jus
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay: Good :3
<Jmo> Wrong, written all over.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so I met some chick named Cynthia. Didn't like the fact I could back off from her challenge. Is she a bonus boss or something? *still a noob*
<DashWithRainbows> Pokemon?
<MadSurge> Aye
<DashWithRainbows> Gen 4 champion
<MadSurge> Wut
<DashWithRainbows> Basically you can fight her during spring.
<MadSurge> WUT
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Cynthia is a bonus boss. She was the champion of Gen 4
<DashWithRainbows> She was the champion in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum.
<Gold_Demona> Which is gen 4
<Jmo> o.o
<Jmo> I go afk and return to pokemon.
<Jmo> What have I done to deserve this cruel fate.
<DashWithRainbows> Although she is one of the toughest trainers in the game.
<Gold_Demona> Cynthia is the SCARIEST of all the champions
<DashWithRainbows> In B2/W2, she has level 75+ pokemon.
<SpeccyRush> I blame the Garchomp
<MadSurge> And they have a previous final boss run at you like any other person without any "watch out, champion abound" signs?
<DashWithRainbows> Not really, she asks if you want to fight
<Jmo> She dresses sexy.
<DashWithRainbows> you have the option to fight her.
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: yeah, which is why I backed off immediately
<DashWithRainbows> You should
<DashWithRainbows> Her team is quite powerful.
<Jmo> Sounds like chavo got his ass whooped something chronic.
<Jmo> :>
<MadSurge> If they give me the choice, I'm sure I shouldn't mess with her
<DerpDash> Hello Everypony! :)

<MadSurge> CountDoofus: I wonder if all kids are like that after "the talk"
<Barb|DontHugMeBro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR8cI4HHUvQ
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<CountDoofus> :)
<MaxTheBrony> "Silly Face Maker"
<MadSurge> Ohai MaxTheBrony!
<MaxTheBrony> Heya MadSurge !
<SafariMonkey> No some people don't like to be greeted until they talk I think Master-Derps.
<CountDoofus> I imagine most will be either embarassed or going "Eeewww!"
<MaxTheBrony> What count?
<CountDoofus> MaxTheBrony: what MadSurge said about my comic.
<MaxTheBrony> May i see it :)
<Master-Derps> SafariMonkey: that me :) well i dont mind it but most of the time when im not saying anything im playing games
<Master-Derps> thats#
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: I dunno, as far as I recollect I was pretty okay about it. My parents never tried to cover it up with the stork or cabbage patch stories
<Vivix> I never had the talk
<Vivix> I didn't realize people actually did have the talk
<SafariMonkey> Well sorry Master-Derps.
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Vivix :)
<Vivix> Hiya max
<Master-Derps> again SafariMonkey nothing wrong
<MaxTheBrony> In Sweden we dont do the "talk"
<SafariMonkey> :)
*Master-Derps rolls back into the list of names
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Vivix> Same here MaxTheBrony - guess it's our scandinavian nature
<CountDoofus> MadSurge: I had to rely on school sex ed. Never heard it from my parents.
<Vivix> I remember we had sex ed once, with an old priest showing us how to put on condoms on chair legs
<MaxTheBrony> heh yeah :P the basics of the subject we get teached by media anyways, no need to talk about it ^^
<Vivix> and then we all got free condoms with strawberry taste
<MaxTheBrony> Whaat
<Jmo> Vivix.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Jmo :)
<Vivix> yeep--strawberry taste
<Jmo> You
<Jmo> just
<MaxTheBrony> We didnt get no Strawberry tast :<
<Jmo> Why would you taste a condom.
<Vivix> well, we were what--14=
<Jmo> SO? >_>
<Vivix> so we took em ou and threw them at eachother
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Vivix> everything smelled like strawberries, and it said "Strawberry taste!" on the pack
<Jmo> So full of excuses you are Vivix.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Jmo> I'm sure.
<AttackWithHugs> Um....
<prince-dari> My sister's school had chocolate, blueberrry, strawberry, vanilla, all sorts.
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: O_o Well, my parents also got me an illustrated book for ten years old about babies and sex :D It was done pretty well
<Vivix> Hehe, crazy schools
<MaxTheBrony> D: Lazy school , we got rubber flavor
<Vivix> awww
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<Vivix> I wonder if taste-condoms are nice-
<Jmo> Dodging this convo egh
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<BladedWings> Vivix: lolwut
<prince-dari> Only one way to find out
<Vivix> Weell- you know-
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Vivix> yep~~
<AttackWithHugs> Why is the chat talking about condoms? What?
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Vivix> sex-ed class talk
<prince-dari> Someone was talking about sex ed or something
<BladedWings> i came back to that as well lol
<RaveBrony> Same
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MaxTheBrony> We are talking about the birds and the bees
<BladedWings> wooo
<Vivix> I never got that saying, it promotes interspecies sex
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah i dont get it either
<MaxTheBrony> why is it Birds and bees?
<RaveBrony> Wut
<prince-dari> Google will most likely explain
<Vivix> bees and the flowers would make sense I guess- but birds?
<prince-dari> "According to tradition, the birds and the bees is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and good consequences of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain example of male fertilisation. Another example, birds lay eggs, a similarly visible and easy-to-explain example of female ovulation."
<RaveBrony> :o
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<BladedWings> Revelation :O
<Vivix> Also: Cole Porter might have coined the phrase-
<SpeccyRush> and here I thought it was cause mt Beedrill could mate withe my pidgey :/
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Vivix> Hehe
<MaxTheBrony> Jmo: Help me out :P Give me something i can Improve or add to this picture ^^
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/My-OC-Pony-Imo-My-best-drawing-yet-335899791
<Jmo> Saw that.
<Jmo> Back legs could be fixed abit, they look abit too skinny.
<MaxTheBrony> right
<prince-dari> huh, when people post art in main chat I have a tendency to assume it's not going to be good
<Jmo> and what is a tail bro.
<Jmo> wat.
<prince-dari> And for once it was wrong
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> Thank you prince-dari :)
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony it instantly made me think of pokemon.
<RaveBrony> ^
<SafariMonkey> MaxTheBrony it's very good. ;)
<MaxTheBrony> SafariMonkey: Im pretty sure i made it look like somthing unintentionaly
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MaxTheBrony> Like a pokemon *
<Jmo> As if you did.
<Jmo> Frekin Pokemon
<MaxTheBrony> So , a tail and wider back legs?
<SafariMonkey> Jmo not a pokemon fan? :P
<Jmo> Pokemon lost my grip after Gen 3.
<MaxTheBrony> same
<RaveBrony> What program do you use, MaxTheBrony?
<RaveBrony> Jmo: Same
<MaxTheBrony> I use Sai Painttool
<Jmo> Better be SAI or I'll hurt you Max.
<Jmo> Good boy.
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<RaveBrony> Im still learning SAI
<MaxTheBrony> Me too
<RaveBrony> Just got it a few days ago
<MaxTheBrony> its a fun program :) and very easy to use
<SafariMonkey> Jmo I still only play up to emerald. :P
<RaveBrony> Its a hard adaption from PSE tho
<Jmo> Meh Emerald.
<Jmo> Ruby/Sapphire was the last for me, Emerald didn't grip either.
<MaxTheBrony> RaveBrony: Yeah i can understand that :)
<RaveBrony> Emerald was my favorite! :$
<Jmo> egh Rayquaza
<RaveBrony> Love that pokemon
<SafariMonkey> Jmo I see. Well I got emerald before ruby or sapphire
<RaveBrony> I liked the way "I" pronouced it....rather than the show/movie
<Jmo> As if.
<SafariMonkey> RaveBrony how did you pronounce it?
<SafariMonkey> I pronounced it rye-KWA-za
<RaveBrony> Rahquahza
<RaveBrony> Not that damn Ray-Quay-za
<SafariMonkey> Ray like light ray?
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<SafariMonkey> Is that how they said it? Ugh
<RaveBrony> I think thas how i heard it, cant really watch any of the movies now :D
<SafariMonkey> RaveBrony so you said it the same as me. :P
<RaveBrony> Yeah :D

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Gameloft Facebook Page Teases a Release Today
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy SafariMonkey!
<Jmo> JUST RELEASE IT ALREADY.
<Jmo> GOD DAMN.
<Everlasting_Joy> So, only 3 days till S3!
<SafariMonkey> Yep Everlasting_Joy
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: IKR :$
<Everlasting_Joy> At first, I wasn't as enthused as I should be, now I'm gitty with joy for it (no pun)!
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: the poniless drought is about to end <3
<SafariMonkey> BTW is it worth watching a rerun on here? (I'll miss the first ep airtime)
<SafariMonkey> If so, whem?
<MadSurge> SafariMonkey: I think after European Movie Night?
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<SafariMonkey> MadSurge that's a bit late for me. :/
<MadSurge> SafariMonkey: Awww :(
<SafariMonkey> MadSurge I'm UK
<SafariMonkey> So it'll be after midnight at least probably
<SafariMonkey> I wish it aired another time. :(
<SafariMonkey> Oh well
<Everlasting_Joy> SafariMonkey: I know what you mean.
<Everlasting_Joy> I don't mean this in a sarcastic tone, I do enjoy sleeping in and than watching the show at a latter time.
<SafariMonkey> Everlasting_Joy it's 3pm for me.
<SafariMonkey> ;)
<SafariMonkey> *:)
<Everlasting_Joy> I know.
<Everlasting_Joy> Thanks to Wre-k, I have a very good knowledge with European time zones.
<SafariMonkey> Everlasting_Joy I see. It also helps that tom gives time in utc
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<prince-dari> Is UTC the same as GMT?
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari basically
<Mistress_RainBowDash> whats the CET on the new pony epi?
<prince-dari> CET?
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Centra Europian Time
<SafariMonkey> It's the standard, and it's based on GMT dari
<prince-dari> GMT is the standard though
<CountDoofus> Haio Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy CountDoofus!
<SafariMonkey> no dari
<prince-dari> Well UTC might be standard for America
<prince-dari> But GMT is standard here
<Everlasting_Joy> How are you CountDoofus?
<Vivix> UTC 0 = GMT 0 + leap second
<Vivix> there's been 37 leap seconds since the creation of UTC
<Unnr> UTC = Ísland time
<Vivix> UTC is universal time coordinated
<CountDoofus> All's good, Everlasting_Joy. Got a new comic up :) But my friend wants to do a commentary on the new episode MLP, and we're not at home when it airs, so I have to wait a few days after the next season begins :'(
<Jezebel1> who here went to EQLA? just curious
<Vivix> UTC is atomic time, GMT is normal time, so- for us who look at our clocks, they're the same
<Jezebel1> how was the convention? heard it was fun and went without a hitch
<Everlasting_Joy> CountDoofus: :(
<SafariMonkey> Interesting fact, UTC was a compromise between the french TUC and the english CUT
<Unnr> SafariMonkey: I was just about to say it
<Vivix> And it's currently the SLI isn't it?
<Vivix> or..SI
<Vivix> whatever it's called
<prince-dari> Well UTC is still pointless for telling the time.
<Vivix> since it's effectively the same as GMT, yeah
<SafariMonkey> SI Vivix
<prince-dari> Maybe it's something they use for satellite geolocation which needs an accurate time or something
<prince-dari> But it's pointless for the rest of us
<Vivix> I think that's the case yeah, with the leapseconds and such, but ultimately,--for us it's just GMT
<Unnr> Actually atomic time is TAI, not UTC
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari everything is defined against utc now
<Vivix> UTC is not the atomic clock but molecule or atomic time measurement-
<prince-dari> Well I don't know anyone here who uses UTC
<Vivix> I read up on it on wiki a week or so ago, but I can't remember
<Vivix> !cd does
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 21 hours, 57 minutes, 56 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Vivix> woops-
<prince-dari> I've never heard it before people on the internet started using it
<Vivix> my computer does- but I personally say and use GMT
<prince-dari> I'd*
*Vivix is a GMT fan
<Vivix> don't like CET--PDT DST--all those, easier with just GMT and UTC
<Unnr> Vivix, TAI is the averaged time of 200 ish atomic clocks around the world, TAI differs from UTC by something like 35 seconds
<Vivix> Aah
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time
<Barb|DontHugMeBro> Mmmm. Copypasta
<Everlasting_Joy> prince-dari: Actually, I use UTC when announcing my show, but I figured UTC = GMT just a more "universal" label.
<Vivix> That's how it is yeah, it's an SI standard, so it's supposed to be universal
<Vivix> just like metric
<prince-dari> Well by 'here' I meant UK
<SafariMonkey> OK gotta go
<SafariMonkey> Bye guys
<BladedWings> bye SafariMonkey
<prince-dari> Cya
<Vivix> baibai
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care SafariMonkey!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Take care SafariMonkey :)
<Vivix> I guess big countries might like using timezones to announce their shows, or internet
<SafariMonkey> Yeah bye. :)
<Vivix> but like most european countries have one timezone- so -I mean, I've never heard anyone say a timezone in person
<Vivix> like totally ever yo

<Deacon> rainbowcrash1357911 have you heard of tara's other characters' songs?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, atleastittakessomeeffort
<RainbowAsh> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<rainbowcrash1357911> now rainbow my dear i can not express my delight
<Invi> Vivix, oooh dat song :d
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<RoboGerbil> wow i just got my dog back from the groomers and wow... they did a really good job
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/04a6258b3d8fc6520700218c0c483eea.gif AAAAAAAAAA I WANT TO DO THAT ;~;
<Vivix> Hehe yeah Invi, it's used in soo many things
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: they said theyd replace it, which again doesnt make sense becuase i dont understand why they didnt turn it off weeks ago, i even offered a battery. it doesnt make sense to me, id think theyre hiding something, but i cant think of what. that or theyre insanely stupid
<Invi> Vivix, ikr?
<MadSurge> :O
<AttackWithHugs> Shizu stream!
<MadSurge> STREAM
<BladedWings> oh my shizu stream ^_^
<rainbowcrash1357911> the stream is on!
<Vordox> Shizuka: <-< You too my image I gave to you!
<MaxTheBrony> suddenly a wild stream appears
<RoboGerbil> a wild stream has appeared
<RaveBrony> :o
<MadSurge> Hello Shizuka! :$
<twoiloight_spurnkle> qube?
<TheMightyIsh> ohai pony pepple
<Vordox> took*
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Shizuka :)
<BladedWings> lol a shizu stream is what it took to get AttackWithHugs to talk :D
<MaxTheBrony> Heya TheMightyIsh :)
<Vordox> Ooooh Qube....
<rainbowcrash1357911> QUBE?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> hoi Shizuka and TheMightyIsh
<AttackWithHugs> shut up BladedWings, i'm mining
<Jmo> It's like the vault dwellers crawled out into the real world for the first time and going crazy over the sun.
<Moopy> hi shizuka
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai TheMightyIsh :3
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, that does sound strange, but I just don't know what else it could even be. Any theories?
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: i thought so *nuzzle* have fun then ^_^
<CountDoofus> That moment when you're looking at a website in complete silence, and suddenly a stream springs to life and you jump out of your seat at the sudden noise.
<TheMightyIsh> what is this?
<Vivix> People don't like to accept things from nosy neighbours, and things go beep when low on battery
<RoboGerbil> Shizuka used hypnotize. it was super effective.
<AttackWithHugs> Mineshaft search COMPLETE
<Lil_B> nothing like these nice Grinding noises when I put in a old CD... when I have to question if I should put on a gas mask when I open it again
<BladedWings> TheMightyIsh: from what i understand, QUBE
<Kandarihu> What game is this? All I can think of is PN-03
<rainbowcrash1357911> you never hurd of qube?
<TheMightyIsh> nope
<BladedWings> ^
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: yeah i have no idea either, especially because of the 1 beep, instead going off like smoke. i dunno, maybe they broke it or something. i thought maybe smoke detectors sense weed or something, but that doesnt make much sense plus the 1 beep
<Invi> Lil_B, why? have you burned a CD? ^^
<RoboGerbil> wat game is this?
<Kandarihu> rainbowcrash1357911, oh, okay. So this is Qube?
<BladedWings> its reminding me of potal lol
<Vivix> Lil_B, remember when sometimes you'd need to put tape on cds to stop them wobbling in your drive?
<rainbowcrash1357911> yes
<Kandarihu> I see. I know PN-03 isn't First person.
<Shizuka> moment
<Lil_B> Invi nope, currently making an Audia Rip
<MadSurge> So did this come before or after Portal?
<TheMightyIsh> this feels like portal
<Dark_Horst> what's this now?
<Eli> evening. who's playing?
<Lil_B> Vivix actualkly now, I've never done that
<Lil_B> evening Eli
<Lil_B> no*
<Dark_Horst> looks liek a cross between portal and jenga
<BladedWings> whatever it was, it looked fun ^_^
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Eli :)
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: i certainly felt the urge to strangle them, because that goddamn beeping has kept me up for the last few weeks
<Vivix> Really? We had to do it to some cheap cds or cds that came with computer magazines to sotp them--rattling and grinding
<MadSurge> Eli: Shizuka is :)
<BladedWings> and hi Eli it be a shizu stream
<Vivix> still have some ancient linux distro cds full of tape
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> You okay, Shizu? Your wallpaper seems.....concerning.
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, WEEKS? Wth is wrong with them?
<Invi> !CD
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 20 hours, 20 minutes, 36 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
<Invi> wohoo
<Vivix> so close
<Vivix> I can TASTE IT
*Invi prepares to celebrate
<Lil_B> Vivix got a new music Project I want to finish (I have many, but most are... meh) a slow Waltz Version of this day Aria :)
<Jmo> Vivix, you're being locked up and not able to watch it.
<Jmo> gg
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, maybe you should tell your landlord. Or even the police.
<smelt> I can taste it too
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/ZayfB
<Vivix> Jmo staap jmo u evil man
<Jmo> How about nooooooo
<smelt> tastes like meat
<Lil_B> Invi bought some Afri Cola to Celebrate
<Vivix> Lil_B, ooh nice, waltz can be really cool
<smelt> no...
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: well, i did manage to fall asleep, but it took a while, i had to turn on my fan to somewhat block out the beeping, though it didnt help much. but yeah, like i said, either theyre retarded or theyre hiding something
<smelt> cupcakes
*smelt grins
<Dark_Horst> beeping?
<Eli> found out today i have "extra courses" with my school this weekend. FML
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, have you tried music via headphones?
<Invi> Lil_B, I always buy that stuff when i see it ^^
<Vivix> It's more likely they're lazy and its in their hallways than anything else
<Lil_B> Vivix I'm basicly just transforming the main song into 3/4 , keeping the key, and trying to make it sound a bit Waltz like
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Dark_Horst: yeah, my idiot neghbors, according to them, have a smoke detector on low battery that has occasionallyt been beeping very loudly the last several weeks
<Vivix> Ah nice
<Invi> Lil_B, I also bought some cola rebell bonbons. they taste.... intresting ^^
<BladedWings> Why did Shizuka stop?
<AJIsAwesome> BladedWings: She had to take care of something. :)
<Shizuka> needed to get food out of oven
<Vivix> I think I'm gonna go into town and buy some maple cola or something fun
<BladedWings> ah ok :)
<TheMightyIsh> http://i.imgur.com/JqRLO.jpg
<Dark_Horst> twoiloight_spurnkle: they do that when they're low on battries. but not changing the batteries for weeks is just them wanting to piss off their neighbours
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: no, but i dont have any music that is both loud enough to block it out, and doesnt have any sort of beat that wouldnt prevent me from falling asleep
<Lil_B> Invi I recently wanted to try out some different Types of Cokes, Sinalco Cola was good, Vita Cola was Awful, just downright hureandous
<RainbowAsh> This looks like a portal knockoff. Is that for kinect or something?
<Dark_Horst> twoiloight_spurnkle: as the other guy said, landlord or police
<Deacon> fisn isnt vegan? -todd ingram
<turtlegod98> GAME?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Dark_Horst: yeah but what makes no sense is how the hell they managed to sleep in that, and they even told me they didnt know what i was talking about
<Vordox> Shizuka: Didn't knew you liked Qube? Or just got it? =3
<Dark_Horst> twoiloight_spurnkle: either they're deaf as fuck or trolling
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, that's too bad. I think it would be really justified for you to call the cops on them.
<Invi> Lil_B,Sinalco cola was okay. Africola is still my favourite. it has that cola taste without burning a hole in your stomach because of acid :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Dark_Horst: they told me they thought i meant a constant beeping that never ends, theirs does end, but it lasts many hours a day at random times
<Lil_B> Invi found the "Werner - Das muss Kesseln" Soundtrack in my Fathers CDs xD
<Invi> lol nice
<Flyboy> oh my...
<Invi> my dad hated that show ^^
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: well now that ive nailed their asses, if they dont, ill have to do something like that. can i call the cops for something like that, though?
<Bronysith> and i purchased armored core 2
<Lil_B> Invi... man, I should vote for Werner... wait, Im don't think it haas an english version -.-, well gonna stick to Manitous Shoe for B Movie than
<alexxm> is it good Bronysith
<Bronysith> alexxm: dont know, hasnt arrived yet
<Deacon> so, I take it this is some sort of indie game?
<Bronysith> alexxm: and wont be for a while
<Lil_B> Bronysith I heard lot of good Stuff about this Franchise
<Invi> Lil_B, i voted for dracula ^^
<Vivix> Lil_B, if it has subs it's okay to vote for it
<alexxm> i voted for the crow and the castle of caglistro
<I> U
<Lil_B> Invi which dracula?
<Vivix> We had a spanish movie here once I think
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, the beeping ends? That is strange. If it was low battery it should keep going. And eventually run out. Yes, you can definitely call the cops for that, it's disturbance of peace.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: all i know is that it is about giant mechs and is difficult...cant wait
<[wub]ehren> I am heeeeeeere
<Lil_B> Vivix I don't think it has even that
<I> bleep
<Vivix> Aww-
<Invi> Lil_B, Bram Stoker's
<TheMightyIsh> This feels like Portal
<Lil_B> Vivix yes, just 2 weeks ago
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: yeah thats another thing that doesnt make sense, it Does end after several hours. none of it makes any sense, maybe they broke it
<RaveBrony> Wow, this game is really cool :o
<Invi> Lil_B, and nosferatu as B-Movie :D
<Deacon> bram stroker you say?
<Lil_B> Invi 1920 Nosferatu?
<vgyftgghvggvgvgvgvgv> >RAPE
<RaveBrony> Now im sad i didnt buy it when it was on sale
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, if you ever find out be sure to tell me. It's a real mystery to me.
<Invi> Lil_B, the black'n'white movie. yeah ^^
<Vivix> Oh really? Hope that wins, never seen that
<MadSurge> Lil_B: 1920 Nosferatu rocks
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: k, theyre indian though, so i wont be able to tell what theyre saying if they talk about it
<Lil_B> Invi wow xD that movie just don't wanna leave me alone xD it always pops up on the reccomandations on Amazon :P
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: with each other i mean
<Invi> Lil_B, I wanna watch it :D
<Lil_B> Invi me too, and the Klaus Kinski Version xD
<Invi> is taht a comedian?
<Lil_B> Invi german acting genious
<RainbowAsh> twoiloight_spurnkle, if they were up to something, I guess they wouldn't talk about it in front of you, if they thought they could understand you.
<RainbowAsh> I'm afk for a bit.
<Invi> hehe
<twoiloight_spurnkle> RainbowAsh: yeah, but they talk somewhat loudly, i can sometimes hear them through the wall
<Lil_B> so, that game takes place in an 1000x1000 white Rubix Cube?
<Deacon> seems like it
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Mr. Monk would love this game
<Polydunami> o_O
<RaveBrony> Monk....i need to watch Monk again
<RaveBrony> I hate that it ended :(
<TheMightyIsh> by any chance does this end with a fight with a psychotic robot puppetmaster?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i mean its perfect for his ocd, its clean, its square, its puzzles
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Deacon> mmhmm

<Vivix> yeah for a day or two I think
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i didnt hear rumors either tbh
<MadSurge> Deacon: yes unfortunately
<SpeccyRush> I give no fucks either way
<AJIsAwesome> rainbowcrash1357911: Check the FAQ. :)

<twoiloight_spurnkle> lawl eyjey
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol good thing Disney didnt get Hasbro,no KH Equestria...for now :D
<Eli> twoiloight_spurnkle: but i think they were really just fandom rumors
<AJIsAwesome> oh shush, sprinkles. :D
<THE> DISNEY SUCKS
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Agreed.
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Eli: looks like
<SpeccyRush> its BronyState not PonyState
<Deacon> THE but...they brought us lion king and toy story....
<THE> NEW DISNEY I MEAN
<Eli> wouldn't have minded KH equestria tho
<Polydunami> Tangled?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Eli: that would be pretty awesome
<AJIsAwesome> THE: Youe were already about the all caps. :)
<SpeccyRush> Disney TV sucks, Disney itself is still good
<AJIsAwesome> *You
<AJIsAwesome> *already warned
<MadSurge> We can do that on our own twoiloight_spurnkle :D
<twoiloight_spurnkle> idk, i like that disney wizard show
<Vivix> SpeccyRush, true
<Polydunami> Except for Gravity Falls, I reckon
<Deacon> my little cousin's auditioning for a disney show, no idea what it is though
<Eli> but srly? two 2-5 billion dollar contracts in less than 3 weeks? na i don't think so
<SpeccyRush> Polydunami: this
<twoiloight_spurnkle> MadSurge: do what?
<THE> IS HAVING ALL CAPS ILLEGAL?
<Vivix> Disney probably would have pulled it from the hub, and dunno who DHX would have been in that move-over
<twoiloight_spurnkle> indeed THE , the caps police will see you soon
<AJIsAwesome> THE: No, but it gets on people's nerves. :)
<MadSurge> twoiloight_spurnkle: our own Kingdom Hearts Equestria :D
<THE> HOW?
<SpeccyRush> inb4 pool noodle
<AJIsAwesome> Pool noodle?
<THE> hell was that?
<Invi> THE, apparently it is
<twoiloight_spurnkle> MadSurge: ah, well, we still havent seen how the other big mlp games project will turn out
<Polydunami> Yeah, don't be excessive about it.
<Ryunosuke> its just rude to talk in all caps all the time
<AJIsAwesome> I really like the visuals in this game. Very nice. :)
<Ryunosuke> caps is cruise control for cool, but you still have to steer :)
<THE> caps lock broke though.
<Eli> yello
<AJIsAwesome> Orange.
<Ryunosuke> blue
<Polydunami> Okay, that's fine.
<Deacon> O-Range

<Eli> twoiloight_spurnkle: actually, half my left hand is permanently numb, so i hit the caps key quite often on accident
<Deacon> no, the final boss is a .... sphere!
<twoiloight_spurnkle> this actually reminds me of a psp game parody video, called cube, but i cant find it anywhere outside the rss psp video
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Eli: damn, what happened?
<Eli> twoiloight_spurnkle: that's what i would like to know :P

<Invi> Polydunami, what about the one who spoilerd?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP Mobile Game Tomorrow Instead According to Kotaku!
<[wub]ehren> most likely?
<[wub]ehren> 100%
<Polydunami> I don't remember that.
<Invi> Polydunami, he got a 1 day ban 1 or 2 hours ago
<Vivix> Well there was a spoiler ban, but it was withou drama or hostility
<Bronysith> [wub]ehren: Saturn is not a virgin
<twoiloight_spurnkle> o thats right, the new mlp game is out soon
<Invi> true
<[wub]ehren> saturn doesn't count
<Polydunami> I wasn't here yesterday :S
<[wub]ehren> hes a planet
<Eli> Bronysith: well i'm libra, thank you very much
<[wub]ehren> been around for millions of years
<Bronysith> Eli: what the fuck does that have to do with anything?
<Eli> Bronysith: :P probably only works in german
<Eli> Bronysith: forget it, i derpt
<Vivix> Jomfruen
<Vivix> It's not called Virgin in english?
<Vivix> Virgo?
<Eli> Vivix: ah yeah
<[wub]ehren> why are you so smart shiz T_T
*Vivix knows zodiac poorly
<turtlegod98> I have a confession to make.
<Eli> Vivix: same thing no?
<Vivix> Thiink so-
<Polydunami> You're a brony, turtlegod98? :3
<turtlegod98> ...I don't like cheese.
<AJIsAwesome> Gah, laptop was derping so I had to reboot. :D
<Polydunami> Oh :(
<turtlegod98> THERE! I SAIS IT!
<AJIsAwesome> I AM THE CHEESE~
<Deacon> gasp
<turtlegod98> *said it
<AJIsAwesome> I am the best character on the show!~
<Vivix> I love Brie!
<Polydunami> BRIE
<rainbowcrash1357911> BACK IN TOWN
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Vivix: brie <3
<Vivix> so good~~
<SirGanjalf> turtlegod98: That HERESY will not be tolerated! *goes for his chainsword*
<twoiloight_spurnkle> [wub]ehren not saying anything bad about her, but just so you know, she doesnt do blind runs, she preplays the gaame
<SpeccyRush> I loved a girl named Brie, but than she tried to kill me~
<AJIsAwesome> ....
<Arkie> i hope scootaloo flies in season 3 or there will be hell to pay :[
<twoiloight_spurnkle> i love cheese
<Arkie> HELL.. to pay
<[wub]ehren> twoiloight_spurnkle i wouldn't be able to clear it in the first place though
<Eli> Arkie: Lauren said she would never fly
<Polydunami> I hope at least one of them gets their cutie mark :S
<Arkie> ...
<Vivix> Lauren no longer has anything to do with the show
<Polydunami> Anyway, this is all speculation
<Deacon> Arkie how will hell pay? debit or cash?
<Eli> Polydunami: and that's very unlikely
<Vivix> but she probably won't get cutiemark or flying
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Well, that was her concept. She's not sure if that's going to be confirmed.
<rainbowcrash1357911> i dont know what to say so heres scootaloo in a tre
<Arkie> Dafuq.. she has wings but no anility to fly
<Vivix> if they get their cutiemark they'll get boring
<Vivix> Arkie she's a cripple in Lauren's draft
<turtlegod98> having a tortois on the show is the closest thing their will be to a turtle on the show. hope they bring tank back with a turtle friend in season 3.
<Vivix> but we don't know what she is in canon
<SirGanjalf> Hi, i like cheese. My favourite is mozzarella, ut i also like emmentaller:P
<Arkie> Vivix: :O
<Invi> SirGanjalf, get bacon with your cheese ^^
<Vivix> Mozzarella is good, I like Chedar too, even if it is kinda boring
<turtlegod98> who wants tank in season 3?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> [wub]ehren: eh you probavbly would, these games tend to not be very hard because people wouldnt buy it
<rainbowcrash1357911> me
<MadSurge> SirGanjalf: mozzarella rocks!
<[wub]ehren> im watcing it right now
<SirGanjalf> Silly Invi, bacon is not a cheese. We're talking about cheese here:P
<[wub]ehren> and it looks impossible
<twoiloight_spurnkle> mozzarella is nice, but brie and camambert are my favorites
<Eli> Arkie: yeah, faust is cruel with little scoots
<AJIsAwesome> I hope the supposed one shot characters make returns in later seasons. :)
<Vivix> We caan make bacon a cheese
<Invi> SirGanjalf, yeah, but like cheese, bacon is an universal food ^^
<Polydunami> I, for one, would like to see a dynamic between Celestia and Luna in season 3.
<rainbowcrash1357911> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Vivix> I am partially vegitarian, but I will never stop eating bacon
<Polydunami> Oh?
<twoiloight_spurnkle> oo
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: But then again, it's a good concept for Scootaloo.
<Shizuka> 13rainbowcrash1357911: Don't spam.
<Vivix> Polydunami, mee too
<Saturn> 08,01whee!
<Eli> Vivix: partially vegetarian?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Same.
<SirGanjalf> Invi: I can agree with that
<rainbowcrash1357911> im spike
<Vivix> Crippleloo is a good concept
<twoiloight_spurnkle> Federer's favorite cheese is Tilsit :3
<AJIsAwesome> Ohai, Saturn. :D
<RainbowAsh> Hey, back again
<Deacon> rainbowcrash1357911 I'm guessing you don't like the princesses?
<MadSurge> Ohai Saturn! :D
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, RainbowAsh. :)
<[wub]ehren> Saturn, your text does look like piss
<Vivix> Eli yeah- not by choice, just- don't enjoy meat very much. Bacon is--DIVINE though
<AttackWithHugs> Hey Saturn
<[wub]ehren> well observed
<Saturn> 08,01i like the princesses >.>
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, so you are a baconvore?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Don't we all? :D
<Vivix> yeah
<rainbowcrash1357911> Deacon what do you mean?
<Deacon> Chedder jack is the best cheese ever, at least for cheez-its
<Eli> Vivix: not by choice? uhhh what do you have?
<Vivix> Ironically, I don't like pig meat
<RainbowAsh> AJIsAwesome, thanku ^^
<Deacon> rainbowcrash1357911 ah nvm
<SirGanjalf> I used to be meatarian
<Vivix> Oh just because-- a lot of meat tastes bad to me
<Vivix> nothing medical
<MadSurge> Saturn: they're both awesome and lovable :)
<VenHur> Hello everypony!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur. :)
<RainbowAsh> Hi VenHur
<Polydunami> Hey there, VenHur :3
<BladedWings> hi VenHur
<MadSurge> Hello VenHur!
<Deacon> elllo VenHur
<Vivix> I can't eat minced meat- pork, lamb- deer- reindeer- chops-- I can eat steaks and bacon, and various pepperonies, chorizos, etc
<Vivix> just because of taste and texture
<rainbowcrash1357911> Hi VenHur!
<Stallion_of_War> Schmancy gloves
<VenHur> Ping, then pong, pings, then pongs, PINGS EVERYWHERE!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai VenHur :)
<AttackWithHugs> Hello VenHur

<Deacon> ELLO Stallion_of_War
<AJIsAwesome> As much as I love meat, I can't eat stuff like pork chops and some steaks.
<Deacon> what about turkey?
<rainbowcrash1357911> Is anyone paying attention to Qube?
<Eli> Vivix: yeah, deer is disgusting to me too. but lamb? *drools*
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: Nope, don't like that either. :)
<Vivix> I respect meat eaters, but- I don't eat alot of it
<Vivix> Hehe
<Polydunami> Lamb is SO GOOD <3
<Stallion_of_War> What is point of game?
<Vivix> Lamb I dunno why, it--smells so strange, and to me it just tastes like wool
<Bronysith> Polydunami: i only like it when it is lamb curry
<Polydunami> I certainly don't mind it roasted :3
<Deacon> Stallion_of_War cubes have points, there's your answer
<AJIsAwesome> I could go for some curry. :)
<Polydunami> Also, curry is good.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<rainbowcrash1357911> can you use a microphone to say things
<turtlegod98> who thinks i'm annoying, types alot and asks too many questions/
<Vivix> Curry is good, but I have to decide what meat to put in
<turtlegod98> *?
<AJIsAwesome> turtlegod98: I don't. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Same.
<Vivix> You're fine so far Turtle
<SpeccyRush> you will never here Shizus voice, ever.
*Eli drools on. "curry"

<Polydunami> Eli D:
<[SWAG]Haku> Yo Deacon, sup
<Vivix> rainbowcrash1357911, ;__; but he named turtlegod
<RainbowAsh> SirGanjalf, it stands for secretly we are gay, if the internet is to be believed
<Eli> sounds the same to me
<[SWAG]Haku> SWAG: So We're All Gods. Twas a clan made in FLuttershy room several moths ago

<[SWAG]Haku> Everyone dead, or wishing they were
<Polydunami> You mean listening to everfree radio?
<Stallion_of_War> How do you watch a radio?
<Eli> rainbowcrash1357911: that's a swag i accept. god i died laughing
<Deacon> rainbowcrash1357911 I don't think I've ever watched a radio before
<[SWAG]Haku> But that's what happens when you leave Haku out of Game Night
<turtlegod98> i wish i were dead...
*Vivix has watched radio many times
<AJIsAwesome> turtlegod98: Why?
<rainbowcrash1357911> i meant listen to it
<turtlegod98> im not worth anything.
<Polydunami> Dang it, radio waves are too big to see :|
<AJIsAwesome> turtlegod98: Why would you say that?
<[SWAG]Haku> On the bright side, everyone went to God Heaven, so there's that. it's like normal heaven, only, you know, better
<Polydunami> Also, woohoo!
<Stallion_of_War> Must be Shizu streaming
<Eli> i watch the radio sometimes. it's awful
<AJIsAwesome> Stallion_of_War: Yep. :)
<Deacon> Stallion_of_War mmhmm
<turtlegod98> because i'm a failier.
<Vivix> A lot of radio stations will sometimes livestream or film their studio so you can watch them- I guess that's like watching radio?
<Saturn> 08,01i've got the Pokemon battle music stuff in my head
<AJIsAwesome> turtlegod98: Why do you think you're a failure?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: WHich gen? :)
<Vordox> Got it Shizuka? =3
<SpeccyRush> Saturn: which era?
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: red and blue
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: OK. :)
<turtlegod98> long to explain but i just fail, ok?
<[SWAG]Haku> Saturn Pokemon, gotta cach em all!
<Polydunami> Saturn has video game music stuck in his head?
<Eli> Vivix: no i literally watch my radio. it's boring
<AJIsAwesome> All those blocks. :O
<Polydunami> Of all things?!
<Deacon> Saturn gym leader theme's cool too
<Stallion_of_War> I am soooooo hungry right now for some reason.

<Stallion_of_War> I just ate lunch though
<Polydunami> Whoa

<Saturn> 08,01does Crystal have the same music?
<Vivix> Hella fun to look at

<Saturn> 08,01becuase it might be the battle usic from that
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Don't think it does. :)
<Polydunami> Crystal is the next generation
<Saturn> 08,01i've only ever played Red and Crystal
<Deacon> Saturn they have some remixes from red and blue, yea
*RainbowAsh hugs turtlegod98

<Saturn> 08,01i didn't really grow up with Pokemon
<Stallion_of_War> Portal and Minecraft had a baby and Shizuka's playing it?
<Polydunami> Yeah, Crystal is part of the second generation of Pokemon, and Red is part of the first.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: That's fine. :D
<RainbowAsh> ^^
<Saturn> 08,01i played it a few months ago for the first time
<Vivix> Beautiful creatures though, aren't they?
<Saturn> 08,01was quite cool
<CrazyCherry> Hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CrazyCherry. :)
<rainbowcrash1357911> like noone ever was
<Deacon> lali-ho CrazyCherry
<alexxm> i think i saw you streaming that Saturn
<[SWAG]Haku> I stopped caring for pokemon when they came out with the Trash Bad pokemon
<SpeccyRush> trippy
<Deacon> rainbowcrash1357911 is catching them your real test?
<CrazyCherry> 2 days 'till season three.
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: ha! yes
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, I only got into pokemon with Black. And now I own soulsilver and white2, too ^^;
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to play Black 2. :D
<Saturn> 08,01i have a GBC emulator on my phone for Crystal
<Saturn> 08,01which i enjoyed more than Red
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Cool. :O
<Vivix> I was recomended black 2 and white 2, but I don't own a DS-
<Stallion_of_War> I feel like pinging Shizu just to see what the lag time is between sending and hearing.
<rainbowcrash1357911> to train them is my cause
<CrazyCherry> Saturn: Am I banned now?
<[SWAG]Haku> Possibly
<Deacon> Red and blue are actually the most broken gens ever, so many bad programmin
<Saturn> 08,01CrazyCherry: yes, but i'll let you see yourself out
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, I tried playing the old games, but the series so much improved so much in regards of quality of life stuff over time
<Polydunami> Banned for what?
<turtlegod98> this looks like a puzzling game
<CrazyCherry> XD
<rainbowcrash1357911> i will travel across the land
<Arkie> GOAL!!!

<rainbowcrash1357911> i now its my destiny
<VenHur> I had a feeling this game isn't Portal due to the gloves and the low resolution graphics.
<Lil_B> Vordox name?
<Deacon> VenHur wonder what gave that away?
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: Well, you actually do get something useful if you get all of them in Black 2/White 2. :)

<Vordox> Lil_B: Can't say, only those who given it know the name
<VenHur> Arkie: No gun.

<Arkie> didn`t you notice that first?
<Lil_B> VenHur how can you tell the resulotion ingame if you watch it via a 360p stream?

<XxNightHawk64xX> NICE!!!!
<Lil_B> rainbowcrash135791 doesn't matter, but you know the rules, you know howpeople behave when you break them, and there is no reason even a 9 year old shouldn't understand and be able to follow them for a brief period of time
<Pinky> Niiiiiice
<Polydunami> Oh, the legal bronystate age is 13?
<turtlegod98> Who is 9?!
<Pinky> or over

<Lil_B> Polydunami not at the time I typed his name... had to get it out anyway than :/
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony. :)
<Vordox> Isn't it cruel to take away freedom due to age?
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: do you know what latitude is?
<Invi> Saturn, can it sting or bite?
<Vordox> Not based on maturity?
<VenHur> *ehem* Moving on.
*MLP_Brovakiin glomps thelonepony "hai!" :3

<Pinky> I am a birdieee
<Vordox> I was almost 20+ mentally when I was around 8. ._.
<VenHur> Narf.
<Yahooz> Vordox: we are also PG-13 in terms of material on chat and stream soooo
<Sylandest> Saturn: Suppose the coronal mass ejections come our way. Should we expect any adverse effects in your opinion?
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: I see what you mean.
<RaveBrony> Aaaaah, wher is Gigabit??? I love these cards! :D
<Deacon> Vordox I suppose so, but I guess that depends on the mentality of the person
<Invi> Saturn, then how does it digest
<Polydunami> This game again? Sweet :3
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: it doesn't
<Vordox> Deacon: Haven't we broken the rules for some people in the past?
<Polydunami> I-Fluid :)
<Invi> doesn't it live long enough to eat?
<AJIsAwesome> I've never seen Shizu stream this game before. :O
<Saturn> 08,01it lives on the reserves it's builds as a caterpillar
<alexxm> huh what game is this
<Deacon> Vordox no idea
<Vordox> SOmeone was 11 but was shown to be quite mature for the age and therefore the rules was lifted?
<Polydunami> She's streamed it before, AJIsAwesome
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: only lives about a week as a moth
<Polydunami> About February, I think
<Invi> up to a month? wow
<VenHur> Sooo...I-Fluid is a game about...pipes...
<Vordox> Saturn: And that's why I don't kill Moths. :P
<VenHur> Mm'kay.
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: I know that, just wasn't here to see it streamed. :)

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek silleh :D
<Vordox> So giving away the game to the people who can stream it
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: in answer to your question, solar flares and CMEs do have an effect on radio communications
<Vordox> Saturn: Disturbances
<Lil_B> ok, one thing left to say here, when you have to avoid absorbing materials, because you are a droplet, than why does this tiny drop not evaporate?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I feel bad now, I was sitting within a few feet of Sibsy at a panel at EQLA and I didn't say hi to her and she told me that I should have said hi on Twitter /)~(\
<Pinky> lolwut

<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: You aren't a brony, we know. *Pat*
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, the fireworks of household objects :D

<thelonepony> bye Lil_B :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Vordox: :<
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: EQ pretty much souped up her name and all =3
<Sylandest> Saturn: Ahhh, so we regular folk can more or less focus on enjoying the aesthetic sights rather than worry for our electronics?
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: But since you hate 1 person or the very website, you miss those thing
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: yup
<turtlegod98> flood
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: put it this way, we already had a *massive* one a few weeks ago
<AJIsAwesome> Sylandest: So what countries are unable to see the auroras?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Vordox: Huh?
<Saturn> 08,01doubtless it went unnoticed by 99% of the population
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: EQD: :P
<AJIsAwesome> Whoops
<AJIsAwesome> * Saturn
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Souped up her name?
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: "Made her famous due to how many people don't know her."
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: And hey, BG Pony now as well...
<Sylandest> Saturn: Indeed...unless I should worry about that one day I felt immensely fuzzy and warm...
<Vordox> Even more fame(Which she deserves)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I knew who she was
<RDLovesPi> anypony care to tell me what we are watching?
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: 56N is about the minimum latitude in the north
