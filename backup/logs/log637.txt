<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Homework: What are you going to do with your life
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: I saw the Gundam style.
<otakon> gold: the trick is to grind on low enemies to build your strength that's all there is to it
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: Make it 20% cooler?
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: haha kudos to you
<HoodyNinja> So you didnt ask before?
<Kencolt> Why is he SURPRISED? It's a damn GUNDAM, and the lead one--- of COURSE it has a Beam Saber.
<SpeedyBolt> But you have to pay for hotels.

<SpeedyBolt> That's too much work.
<otakon> SpeedyBolt: seriously that's all you have to do
<Kandarihu> Funny time to come back

<Kinixys> Not weapons that can kill from Saturn. No.. it's a beam sword.
<HoodyNinja> EVERY

<HoodyNinja> TIME!
<oni_link> I do and don't want to play TF2. This show is keeping me glued to the stream 6_9
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I remember the first Mother.........so much level grinding......:D
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Homework: eeyup but that's how RPG's were back then
<Sumica> 00,10yay
<SpeedyBolt> I never beat the first Mother.
<SpeedyBolt> I got to some kind of tunnel, then Tarantula, and then I got scared and never played again/
<PillowPoni> Eh
<Kinixys> RoboGerbil: Sith mecha. That's a scary thought. Queue that up for Episode 7.
<LadyStratos> Sestuna: IM SO ALOOOOOOOOOOONE

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Sumica: :D
<gold> apparently ninten's and ness' dads have un limited mony and enough trust to trust 10 ( ? ) year olds with 100s of dollers -__-
<LadyStratos> You're a poo ;3;
<Yahooz> as in pooland?
<Kinixys> Slide!
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: If its any consolation. I stopped playing OOT until 2000 because of the Re-Deads. And then Wind Waker scared the crap out of me too. I flung my controller...
<LadyStratos> Yes. The glorious republic of Pooland, Yahooz =3=
<prince-dari> President Poopert
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> gold: Tell that to an 11 old kid that managed to take down a world wide criminal organization alone.
<PresidentPoopert> you know it
<SpeedyBolt> oni_link: I feel your pain...
<HoodyNinja> oni_link: I killed all the re-deads in the town when I was 5, and I still brag about it to this day
<LadyStratos> Real subtle Tieria >3>
<SpeedyBolt> "AAAAAH"
<HoodyNinja> I had nightmares for weeks, though
<LadyStratos> Milk. GOOD FOR THE BONES.
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: IMO the Wind Waker Re-Deads were the scariest because of the way they chomp on you and their scream. >.>
<HoodyNinja> LadyStratos: RANDOM CAPSLOCK!
<Sumica> 00,10I was expecting a weta bug with a tophat and monocle
<SpeedyBolt> and the fact that they looked like scary dead women?
<Dusty> Hey!
<HoodyNinja> Wind Waker had re-deads? I never got that far :(
<Dusty> What's up?
<LadyStratos> Lockon <3
<HoodyNinja> Dusty: Cieling
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: Well lucky you. I was pretty much scared of anything zombie related at the time.. and They did :P
<gold> 6_9 true
<Yahooz> prince-dari: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54493344/President%20Poopert%20of%20Pooland.jpg

<Kandarihu> HoodyNinja, eeyup. They're pretty late in the game, but they're there.
<Dusty> Alright.
<Dusty> What's down?
<prince-dari> ;_;7
<Sumica> 00,10that is a silly salute
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: Yep. And they scream at you and you become parylyzed.
<oni_link> Darn Triforce map hunting....
<Yahooz> and that comic is genius
<prince-dari> Then Sumica died ;_;7
<LadyStratos> DAT KICK.
<Yahooz> hehehe
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> oni_link: That's the only thing I didn't really like about WInd Waker.
<LadyStratos> dari I love you XD
<oni_link> I am so not used to that salute either Sumica
<NullRadix> ... and after the rededs paralyze you, the WALL MASTERS grab you. Or your friend.
<Dusty> Yo, Wrek still online?
<Sumica> 00,10oro?
<Reflexonation> Hello.
<LadyStratos> Dusty: He's sleeping.
<Sumica> 00,10what did I do?
<Dusty> :O
<Dusty> Oh.
<Dusty> Okay.
<Cades> i hate wasps
<Dusty> QUICK.
<Reflexonation> Slow.
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: Hello?
<Reflexonation> Hi :D
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> NullRadix: To be honest, I never was scared of Wall masters. :D
<HoodyNinja> oot redeads were scarier :/
<gold> i'm going to be going to bed soon...
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome|Homework: yeah me too. At first I was skeptical about the whole cel shaded thing but I had alotta fun with it and that was the only thing that I felt could have been changed. I loved the parry system
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Homework: WALLMASTERS ARE THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: Not to me. I just found them annoying. :D
<NullRadix> AJIsAwesome|Homework: they aren't that bad in the newer games... in the classic game they appeared like... at the VERY END of the dungeons
<Reflexonation> I feel so new here...
<Sumica> 00,10likelikes are worse
<NullRadix> and there aren't "shortcuts" to get back to the end
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: Are you?
<Sumica> 00,10they eat your shit
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> oni_link: DEFINITELY the parry system. Best system in years and I still love it.
<Reflexonation> I'm highly new here.
*HoodyNinja enjoyed the fighting system in TP
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Wind Waker's ReDeads are the worst
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: WallMasters were nothing to me!! But the Shadow Temple... thats a different story
<Reflexonation> Dusty told me about this all.
<LadyStratos> XDDD
<Reflexonation> I'm Max, by the way.
<SuperPhony64> They are not welcome to consuming my fecal matter :<
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: Welcome to random, have you read the rules yet?
<Yahooz> whenever i hear Louise in that voice it reminds me of Zero no Tasukamai
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> SaxyPretender: They scream at you. Creepy. :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yep
<shibaru> Have you ever been stung?
<Reflexonation> No, I haven't.
<Sumica> 00,10meanwhile in the nation of silly hats
<Cades> no, and i dont want to
<LadyStratos> I liek hats.
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: essentially that was a newer version of Wind Waker's parry system. I loved all the hidden techniques! Helm Splitter and Mortal Draw forever!!! And also that badass sword spin Link did when he sheathed his sword after you defeated an enemy :3
<Yahooz> I like hats...
<Yahooz> i have this red one
<Yahooz> its pretty fantastic
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: Welcome! :)
<sub06905> each time they say Gundam take a shot
<HoodyNinja> oni_link: I don't like Skyward sword because of the running system and fighting is a pain, the first boss took me 2 hours
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome|Homework: I hope they bring back the parry system or Twilight Princess' combat system :)
<gold> Yahooz: is it red's hat?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: As long as you read the rules, you'll be fine here. :)
<Reflexonation> Thanks. :) so can anyone give me a little intro-guide-thing?
<Yahooz> gold: nope. just a red hat
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> oni_link: Definitely.
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Kandarihu> sub06905, every time they mention the name of the primary plot element of the series?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: The rules will basically tell you everything. :)
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: Yeah it takes some getting used to. I agree that the sprint system was a bit intrusive, we could have done without it.
<gold> i have i black hat ( anyone who played pokemon GSC HG/SS should know that tho 6_9 )
<Reflexonation> Rules seem pretty self-explainitory.
<LadyStratos> Oh Lockon poor babby ;__;
<gold> a*
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: I liked the fighting system, but not the running system. THat kind of annoyed me.
<HoodyNinja> I hate how they're trying to emphasize on the whole motion controlling gimic on the newer wii games, it was fun at first, but now they took it too far
<oni_link> I hated Ghiriam (not sure I spelled his name right) , I could't hit him for at least what seemed like 5 minutes
<sub06905> Kandarihu: yup
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> oni_link: I had the EXACT SAME problem.
<SlurryMoon|unleashed> 03 Watching a movie called unleashed, see you all afterwards

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: Can't really tell who's worse: Fi or Na'vi
<Kinixys> I hope the pilots are okay.
<otakon> So does anyone else get Zaku/Leo vibes from those green MS'?
<otakon> HoodyNinja: he's IN IT
<shibaru> It fucking hurts
<Reflexonation> So anyone want to give me a rundown of what goes on here?
<Dark92Enigma> NO SHIT!
<otakon> HoodyNinja: the trailers SHOW HIM kcking asse
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, Reflexonation
<HoodyNinja> Fi was her name, thats right
<otakon> so who's this big guy?
<Dark92Enigma> Of course that's A GUNDAM?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we're a streaming website
<CrimsonPeewee> http://fav.me/d3534pe

<CrimsonPeewee> oldie art
<Dark92Enigma> OF COURSE!
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Elmo
<otakon> Reminds me of The-O
<HoodyNinja> dat head
<otakon> plus he's a biggun
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome|Homework: That first battle was soo annoying! After that though, the game felt too easy combat wise. But then again, ALL Zelda games get easy when you get the controls down :/ I wish they would focus on making the battles harder and that they went back to the darker tones that OOT, MM and even Twilight Princess had. Skyward Sword's bosses looked like something out of a Yo-Gabba Gabba episode... IMO
<Cades> lol
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: :D

<oni_link> Thats cool Reflexonation , with all that practice you can get your points across rationally :D
<otakon> Reflexonation: start typing the nick you want to ping...adn what Sumica said

<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: Use this place as practice
<HoodyNinja> I learnded about bronystate through the you of tubes
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Dusty told me about it just today.
<Kencolt> Reflexonation: And above all, follow the rules.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: Okay.
<oni_link> HoodyNinja: I saw myself in one of the vids :D
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: He was saying it's pretty cool.
<flutter_spin> Derpy Wombo Combo video. That's how I learned.
<Reflexonation> Kencolt: Don't worry, I will. :)
<Kandarihu> Reflexonation, half of the mods here have kickbots who will kick if you send 6 lines within 10 seconds. otakon trips that all the time.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I learned about Bronystate through Ballad of the Brony.

<flutter_spin> WOOOT GARDEN
<LadyStratos> Wub! Wub! WUB WUB WUB!

<Meanwhile> Windows cannot something.
<flutter_spin> I love this video

<Dark92Enigma> Is this the MLP version of........what was Link's fairy again?
<Kencolt> People who do things like this amaze me.

<Dark92Enigma> otakon it took FORRRRRRREEEEEEEVER, believe me
<Silver_Spoon> <3 STC
<flutter_spin> Sumica: Yeah I'm not caught up to the speed with TF2. Sadly, the same could be said about Dr. Who. Although, I did see the season premiere
<Sumica> 00,10last video twilight_sprinkle
<Silver_Spoon> *SAC
<otakon> Masamune Shirow draws a overaccentuated female at times
<twilight_sprinkle> o ok
<otakon> but he weaves a fairly good story
<cachi01|phone> Goodnight everypony :)
<sub06905> night cachi01|phone
<HoodyNinja> otakon: And your complaining why?
<Silver_Spoon> night cachi01|phone

<oni_link> HoodyNinja: me too. Its one of those shows you have to give time to watch and focus on it
<HoodyNinja> goodnight cachi01|phone we barely knew thee
<flutter_spin> YES YES YES
<otakon> I like the old Shirow anime
<flutter_spin> I love this ep
<otakon> Like Dominion Tank Police
<Kandarihu> Ah, more about the Laughing Man
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Ah, good to see you again
<otakon> I LOVE Dominion Tank Police
<otakon> ?
<sub06905> his voice :D
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: You have to see Wrek draw. He's an AMAZING artist. :)
<otakon> did I hear Tai?
<Kandarihu> Welcome to the future of IRC
<otakon> I HEAR TAI!
<flutter_spin> Dat visual forum room
<otakon> TAI AND ICHIGO
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: What does he draw?
<otakon> and steve blum
<Sumica> 00,10I wish my loging in was that cool
<HoodyNinja> Kandarihu: I call red haired chick
<twilight_sprinkle> dat lightning
<otakon> oh yeah it's TOTALLY not The Major
<LunarRepublicGuard> dat face
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: Mostly pony art. He recently drew an admiral Applejack.
<oni_link> Kandarihu: one day....
<Forgottencrow> LOL ANIME IN ENGRISH xD
<flutter_spin> otakon: First time I watched this, I didn't THINK it was the major. I got caught up in the episode.
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: That's pretty cool, got a link?
<Maid_RainBow> this anime is good in english
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: He may draw some art that may be more mature, but he doesn't do it that often.
<twilight_sprinkle> troll battles?
<otakon> Reflexonation: watch out though, he has a saucy section too
<flutter_spin> OBJECTIOn
<otakon> They're talking through text
<otakon> what they're saying appears in front of them
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: That's alright, I raised myself on the internet. I've seen mature content.
<otakon> this is a visual reprentation of a chat room
<Sumica> 00,10that is other people in the room
<otakon> it's basically HERE
<Kandarihu> Lurkers
<HoodyNinja> otakon: IT WORKS SO WELL!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he's a maaaaaan
<Kandarihu> They're afk
<flutter_spin> those are the pony# in the room :P
<Sumica> 00,10the text you see is the people sitting in the background adding in
<otakon> eeyup
<pony_140200> ponies, ponies everywhere
<oni_link> I think Im going to redo my OC, his hair and eyes dont resemble me at all :/ Im like a mexican Pinkie pie essentially
<Meanwhile> Chatrooms like that would be so weird...
<otakon> Sumica: so those at the table are ops?
<otakon> Meanwhile: are you kidding? this is great!
<Sumica> 00,10kinda
<Kandarihu> Oh, you're right.
<Sumica> 00,10it's more like the active talkers
<otakon> ah
<twilight_sprinkle> this kira is a fake!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: http://wreky.deviantart.com/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...is that Steven Jay Blum?
<otakon> SaxyPretender: sure ot it
<pony_140200> ponies, too many ponies
<oni_link> otakon: I agree totally
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yesss
<otakon> SaxyPretender: and Tai AND IChigo's VA's
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Wow, those are pretty damn good.
<Meanwhile> otakon: They mentioned no one else would come down the table earlier, presumably the people there are like, their regulars, and the background are metaphorically the lurkers.
<otakon> Meanwhile: aha
<flutter_spin> "cool"
<otakon> So that old guy is Kencolt?
<Reflexonation> What anime is this, guys?
<shibaru> I asked Mike if he wanted to "Cure my chestpain" and he said no so I'm all like "So you want me to be in pain? YOU'RE SO MEAN TO MEEEE!" I wonder if he'll think I'm really that hurt by it .w.
<otakon> no offense Kencolt
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<HoodyNinja> ALL THIS INFORMATION
<flutter_spin> "Ghost in the Shell"
<HoodyNinja> THIS ANIME IS THE HYPEST SHIT!
<Maid_RainBow> Ghost in the shell Stand alone Complex
<flutter_spin> This episode was very good at summing up all the episodes
<otakon> Reflexonation: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
<shibaru> Because... He'd probably... be right
<Kandarihu> I guess it's hard to imagine IRC changing in the future. IRC's been pretty much the same for decades, even after this series.
<sub06905> needs 4Kids Dub :D
<Sumica> 00,10dat sause joke
<flutter_spin> Apple :P
<shibaru> I DON'T EVERN KNOW ANYMOIRE QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> sub06905: NO! Please no! :D
<Meanwhile> Driiiiiiiift.
<oni_link> I would LOVE to have the option to have a chat like this, but not be confined to using only this chat. I would like a text based thing kinda like we have now too.
<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> Kandarihu: well this is more of a visual reprentation, this doesn't actually look like that in their world. Think of the animation in a characters brain to represent the abstract process of thought in other cartoons.
<Reflexonation> Okay.
<Sumica> 00,10just think of all the pony avatars you would see if this chat was like this
<flutter_spin> like Reboot, otakon :P
<otakon> :)
<otakon> flutter_spin: maybe
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah they should have pony heads
<Meanwhile> Sumica: You cannot unsee this scene with the mane 6.
<oni_link> I would actually be a Fierce Deity avatar :D
<Sumica> 00,10then again i would problably need a fire hose to stop the ERP
<HoodyNinja> This is why I don't like this anime. Too much talking. I know, call me childish.
<otakon> Sumica: lol
<otakon> Sumica: or a Tachikoma
<Cades> maybe he just thinks ur screwing around. i would tell him that ur not bullshitting and you actually need his help
<flutter_spin> dat star trek badge
<Dark92Enigma> OK Gotta dash everypony
<oni_link> later Dark92Enigma
<HoodyNinja> boodbye Dark92Enigma
<otakon> by Dark92Enigma
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Dark92Enigma
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Dark92Enigma: Bye! :)
<Maid_RainBow> HoodyNinja : i agree but i still love this anime
<sub06905> bai Dark92Enigma
<Reflexonation> Later Mr.Darky.
<otakon> ah yess the laughing man
<Reflexonation> :3
<HoodyNinja> moral... sex position?
<Kandarihu> otakon, I think it's more of a centralized room. Maybe one where people with paid premium accounts get their own avatars and voicechat, whereas freeloaders only get to send text.
<flutter_spin> the truth.
<otakon> hmm
<shibaru> I dunno... I mean, that would be pretty fucked up if he thought I was joking when I said I stop breathing every so oftern....
<otakon> yay!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Happy birthday, Ponychat! :)
<Kinixys> Smart/artsy anime is best.

<flutter_spin> SNACKS
<shibaru> Yea, this has happened to me several times before and the person I liked the most at the time was the only one who could help me and since right now the person I like most is Mike, gotta ask him
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: If you're wondering how the italicized text is made, type "/me" before you type anything else. That's called RPing.
<MakerDusk> woohoo!!! I made it one year as an admin with most of my sanity intact!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Or just one example of RP.
<Yahooz> nicr
<Yahooz> *nice
<Reflexonation> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Thanks!
<DJMidgetBrony[live]> What sanity
<flutter_spin> although, we don't really care of 'real rping' here

<LadyStratos> @_@
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Oh no......
<Sumica> 00,10because tits
<sub06905> no they would all be FBI Men in chatroom
<HoodyNinja> MakerDusk: Don't let Celestia find out
<Reflexonation> Should I give myself a proper introduction?
<MakerDusk> :O
<shibaru> Whenever he says no, I just say "Well, I guess I'll have to wait till it just goes away on it's own" I've had this for months once when my mic broke. It never went away on it's own. I had to get a new mic
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Reflexonation: Sure if you want to. :)
<MakerDusk> not celestia!
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: No thats fine
<Kandarihu> sub06905, only the little girls.

<flutter_spin> Don't worry Sumica. We all know you like having a female OC
<Reflexonation> HoodyNinja: Alright then.
<otakon> STEVE BLUM WAS IN DIGIMON
<HoodyNinja> Reflexonation: Just hang around for awhile, let everyone get to know you
<LadyCanary> And you realize this now, otakon? o3o

<Reflexonation> HoodyNinja: I do have to get going pretty soon, got to get up at 4:30 for work and school T_T

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I mean, him being BlackWarGreymon is the reason I have such a mancrush on him
<Petrified_Discord> Reflexonation: Yeesh. Have fun with that :P
<otakon> Johnny Young Bosch is that other guy

<Kandarihu> Sumica, except that G3 would be as good as what G4 is, and we'd all be whining about G2
<Rain> Boberaaaaaaan~

<ingwaz> DerpStar: most likely some time very late september to mid-late october
<Ryunosuke> feh
<Barbetos> Well this is interesting.
<ingwaz> DerpStar: or possibly even later in the year really
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> kinda reminds of Fantasia
<Moopy> ummmm ok what happen to the voices?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> crazy people on deviant art adding my stuff to their favorites and stuff
<DerpStar> Okie Dokie Loki
<Sumica> 00,10what do you meen /just/ back ground
<ingwaz> ....why is it silent...
<CrazyCherry> Nice twansition Sumica!
<JESmith71> Moopy: BGM version
<Rain> its BG
<Kencolt> This episode makes me feel sad. I mean, the lack of education apparent in most ponies...
<MirrorImage> ingwaz - this is the no-voice edit
<Kinixys> Sandy Duncan did great voice work for G1. Does anyone else think so?
<Moopy> hmmm
<Kandarihu> Moopy, this is a Vocal Free edit, designed to draw attention to the OST
<ingwaz> but....i like the voices MirrorImage
<Moopy> i see
<Petrified_Discord> This episode has some fantastic BGM
<MirrorImage> so read the subtitles in your head in the voice of Morgan Freeman
<Barbetos> The ambienance is louder than the talking.
<ingwaz> oh pinkie, i love you even when i cant hear you
<Barbetos> Er ambiance.
<Moopy> hang on a minute my cat is scratching on my door
<MasterBrony> i prefer Gordan Freeman
<Polydunami> This is the episode with the vocals stripped away.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ok this really reminding me of Sorcerer's Apprentice :D
<ingwaz> you know...this does draw to my attention just how much work the BGM people put in to this show
<Polydunami> Well, the MAIN vocals
<MasterBrony> i read mine in the voice of Gordan Freeman
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ingwaz: IKR?
<DerpStar> yay theme !
<DerpStar> Wait
<Kandarihu> Well, the music is very incidental though. At least it's not constantly loud like how some studios do it.
<MirrorImage> DerpStar - "no-voice edit"
<MirrorImage> ALL the voices
<ingwaz> AJIsAwesome|Homework: shall have to thank steffan andrews more often
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: another Voice free ep?
<sub06905> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<ingwaz> he does do the BGM i believe right?
<DerpStar> I heard Pony I know I did!
<Moopy> ok hes not there anymore
<ingwaz> or is that william anderson?
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<Barbetos> WHAAAAA
<CrazyCherry> sub06905: Wut.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Kandarihu: And that is why I love the music in this series.
<Pinkies4thWall> Btw, sumica, HUG
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so how far in guild wars are you kirz|GW2 ?
<Ryunosuke> I dunno
*Sumica hugs Pinkies4thWall
<ingwaz> Sumica: was that yes directed towards me?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Sumica: Is this video still on youtube?
<kirz|GW2> you know Sumica, I was just thinking to myself the other day, we ~really~ don't see Lesson Zero enough >.>
<Ryunosuke> MLP without voices is like a BLT without the bacon :)
<kirz|GW2> about level 40
<Sumica> 00,10yeah all of s1 and most of s2
<Kandarihu> LT
<kirz|GW2> out of 80
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol special guest Christopher Walken as Luna "I got a huzzah,and the cure is it to be doubled!" :D
<MasterBrony> sumi wassup?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Sumica: Okay, thanks. :)
<DerpStar> Ryunosuke: So a pony approved Sandwich?
<ingwaz> Ryunosuke: crisp and delicious? just not as delicious as with bacon?
<Polydunami> Background noises are still present :3
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> inb4 Derpy. :)
<Ryunosuke> it .. .isnt bad, it is just missing a key ingredient :)
<Moopy> look derpy!
<Kinixys> Chritopher Walken guest voicing for MLP would be epic.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd be okay with that
<MirrorImage> Kinixys - ehh... i'd prefer either Patrick Stewart or Morgan Freeman
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Polydunami: Well they can't get everything.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Derpy's a paper bag wizard! :( now she's a paper SAD wizard
<MirrorImage> the kind of people who you'd get your money's worth out of by giving them a speech JUST so you can hear them speak more
<MasterBrony> so help me Celestia......if you preent me from hearing my sweet Princess Luna's voice, i will find you, and i will kill you Sumica
<Kandarihu> A vegetarian dish is only vegetarian to those who can eat meat but chooses not to. The same dish to an herbivore is merely edible.
<DerpStar> MirrorImage: We already have the best voice from Star Trek, we need to divesify
<JESmith71> Patrucj Stewart as Starswirl The Bearded
<Moopy> i'll bet 1 of you guys have a rainbow wig
<Ryunosuke> what ingwaz said, it isnt bad, it would just be more delicious with the bacon
<Kinixys> MirrorImage: I'm okay with them, too!
<Sumica> 00,10deal with it
<Spectrum_Rush> those are good choices, but BRIAN BLESSED is needed
<JESmith71> Patrick
<Polydunami> Aww, I can't hear Zecora's sexy voice :(
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I really love this music coming up.
<Petrified_Discord> Pic related: http://derpy.me/dUHXo
<Sumica> 00,10we watch the eps normaly all the time
<MirrorImage> DerpStar - yes... but consider the possibilities...
<ingwaz> its not a bad change
<MirrorImage> Patrick Stewart Zebra...
<MasterBrony> thats what killing you is helping me do, deal with it.....
<ingwaz> its kind of like story time...
<MirrorImage> you just KNOW he'd ham it up
<CrazyCherry> THUNDER MADE MY STREAM GO BUFFER!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol why wasnt there a Simon Belmont pony?! :D
<ingwaz> also, scootawolf is awesome
<Moopy> ha ha
<DerpStar> MirrorImage: that would mean creating more "Q" episodes just to hear Stewart
<ingwaz> and sweeticula
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so you were saying you will take it slow and enjoy the game
<Moopy> it made you buffer
<Sumica> 00,10the crickets sound like the larva from hl2
<Kandarihu> Yes, this is certainly one suggestion that I'd like to see happen. A Starswirl the Bearded flashback voiced by Patrick Stewart... or BRIAN BLESSED!
<MirrorImage> not necessarily DerpStar. no one said we had to mix the Stewart/DeLancie rivalry
<DerpStar> And since they are limiting the series to 13 episodes a season I'm not willing to make that trade off
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm off to bed
<Sumica> 00,10night SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good night everyone and enjoy the stream

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Don't know if I should sleep or watch stream.
<Meanwhile> I'm just naturally faster than average.
<Polydunami> Well, Royal Canterlot Voice I expect to shine through.
<Polydunami> Yep
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat JAWS pony
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I really like this BGM only video.
<Kencolt> First time we see the "recovered" Luna, BTW.
<kirz|GW2> also, I just love when I hit an evade ability, and jump backwards right off a cliff into a group of more mobs >.<
<MasterBrony> time to kill Sumica........
<Sumica> 00,10there is no muteing the royal canterlock
<Petrified_Discord> lol you can still hear Luna :D
<twilight_sprinkle> her thuum is too powerful for the mute!
<DerpStar> Royal Canterlot Voice defeats muted voice
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Luna will love SimGretina's remix of her.
<Meanwhile> Disengages young legacy of landing in lava continues...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that takes us to the lesson.. don't jump backwards of a cliff
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: she does not neeeeed. A microphone...
*MasterBrony forgives Sumica for the mute
<Polydunami> I can BARELY hear Luna
<Rain> none can quiet the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!
<DerpStar> Why is no-pony respecting her authoriteh?
<Kandarihu> Well, Royal Canterlot Voice has been defeated.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Her voice is buckin' POWERFULL!! AHHH! :[ :D
<ingwaz> twilight sparkle uses lecture!
<ingwaz> its super effective!
<kirz|GW2> the cliff isn't always there when you start the fight
<kirz|GW2> ninja cliffs
<DerpStar> Tis Tradition!
<Kandarihu> Oh, I see.
<Meanwhile> Cliffs need railings.
<ingwaz> :o i can still hear the voices...just barely
<Polydunami> TWILIGHT SPARKLE uses LECTURE.
<Polydunami> Target falls asleep.
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: i would never fall asleep during a twilight lecture :O
<Petrified_Discord> Fluttershy uses Stare. Target is now paralyzed.
<ingwaz> Polydunami: id stay awake through one of her lectures, if you know what i mean ;)
<Barbetos> Well. Time to execute my cunning plan!
<Polydunami> Me neither :D
*Barbetos "MUhAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
<DerpStar> Barbetos: How cunning?
<twilight_sprinkle> COME!

<CrazyCherry> THESE DAYS, THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE CAN BE GATHERED VIA CAPS LOCK KEY.
<kirz|GW2> I like the aoe the longbow gives me, but I think the shortbows are better for raw damage output
<MirrorImage> and lest you forget that pony skeletons are made of Marshmallows...
<DerpStar> Hey Dinky!
<ingwaz> oh pinkie, you make me smile
<Sumica> 00,10yes but we call it Canterlock

<Sumica> 00,10FiW> serious>wut
<NocturnalBlade> dat success score

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I love it that even the fact that even though Luna has been around for a long time, she has no idea what fun is. :D
<DerpStar> Lol Sweetie Vamp
<Prince_Blueblood> I feel like an idiot

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DOH! :|

<Spectrum_Rush> AJIsAwesome|Homework: the word fum did not existed a thousand years or so ago

<Spectrum_Rush> *fun
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY POINTS!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: it surprised me that they continued the thing in the next ep
<Prince_Blueblood> I was doing some pattern analysis and discovered that's the only solution that would cause the math rules to be consistent
<Prince_Blueblood> google agrees
<ingwaz> Sumica: that or shes just putting on an act in order to go from her previously feared appearance of nightmare moon to someone who is likable by all the ponies
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Spectrum_Rush: I know, I'm just joking. :D
<ingwaz> Sumica: i think the 2nd sounds more likely
<Prince_Blueblood> Polydunami, yes, that's true, but still it's a bit surprising
<Polydunami> Even INFINITY to the power of zero is one :O
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> and so Big Mac was BITTEN by luna's spider and became the dumbest super hero,HORSE SPIDER MAN
<kirz|GW2> "Skritt Thief Rikkih", "Skritt Thief Tikkih"
<Prince_Blueblood> stating a rule doesn't necessarily mean you understand why it's what it is

<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: how to google?
<NocturnalBlade> hi MASF123

<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> That's like 4 evers.... :(
<kirz|GW2> how to kill your game, step 1: tell the gamers they can only play your game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep and they are trying to grow eSports at the same time
<NocturnalBlade> hi Ninjazz
<Kinixys> That scene of Dashy riding Tank is great.
<Petrified_Discord> Little guy. Almost the same size as Spike. Seems legit.
<Ninjazz> !mail GilDash Well, hop on when you're awake and not working and see if I'm on. If not, I've done the math wrong.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and doing it by putting restrictions to it ... makes senes right ?
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Sumica> 00,10why not both pets Dash?

<Rain> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/303586_426540424078702_1659472944_n.jpg
<NocturnalBlade> i love all the streamers
<twilight_sprinkle> SB is awesome too
<Moopy> thanks sumica for the stream bro
<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> But there are things known as favorites
<Silver_Spoon> rain: lolol
<twilight_sprinkle> he had the guts to stream something..
<Ihop> lol Rain
<Polydunami> What's a brain, Rain?
<Polydunami> :3
<Rain> :p
<Petrified_Discord> Polydunami: I think it's a kind of food?
<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> Brain...is that like some raisen cereal or something?
<Ihop> dats rasin brain
<Polydunami> No, it's definitely some kind of precipitation.
<Moopy> Hey spike who do you like better rarity or twilight?
<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> That picture should be the stream loading screen.
<twilight_sprinkle> helms have been used for many centuries tho..
<Polydunami> But in hockey...
<Petrified_Discord> Hockey in armor. Make it happen.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Umm...why are you trying to compare me with Sumica?
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: because you have two similar first letters!
<Silver_Spoon> Polydunami: the stick ain't supposed to go over the waist:P
*Jmo glomps SuperBrony64
<Moopy> that was funny you guys were playing go fish yesterday
*SuperBrony64 hugs Jmo back
<Ninjazz> Becuase people like playing favorites, SB. :<
<Polydunami> I don't get it :S
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: and sucking up
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well, I mean, I wasn't even talking in this chat and somehow two people mentioned Sumica being better than specifically me. Not sure why that was...
<kirz|GW2> aaaaaand all my money is gone to unlock the next tier of skills >.<
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: ah nothing, it was random
<Ihop> we love you SuperBrony64
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Rain> dont worry about that, SuperBrony64. people are just being dicks
<Silver_Spoon> ^
<Moopy> yeah i'd do to dude
<Ninjazz> And don't know how to speak politely and be courteous to people who don't even need to work for them.
<Polydunami> Personally, I like Chocolate and vanilla flavoured ice cream equally :3
<Sumica> 00,10so many pings and wth guys that's not nice
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I like you all too, but just seemed a bit out of the ordinary. I don't mind if people dislike me, just if people have solid reasons for it.
<Ninjazz> But still do.
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: who in their right mind could dislike you :O
<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> I never said Sumica was better than you. I don't dislike you at all SB64.
<twilight_sprinkle> no seriously,
<MASF123|UNDEAD_NIGHT> I'll leave you tonight if your bothered by it.
*NocturnalBlade hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Pinkie Pie
<Ihop> Sumica <> SuperBrony64
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: it was just totally random, dont worry about it
<JESmith71> Well not really jumping in on it but like I said I like both you guys
<Silver_Spoon> My understanding was it was a like -more- but not a dislike. Like liking chocolate more than vanilla, but loving Ice cream in general
<Polydunami> *you're :P
<twilight_sprinkle> vanilla is best flavor
<twilight_sprinkle> for ice cream
<Polydunami> You're a little too late with the ice cream analogy, Silver_Spoon :3
<Petrified_Discord> Hell yeah vanilla
<Silver_Spoon> Polydunami: I was feeding off what you said :x
<Silver_Spoon> >_>
<Polydunami> Oh -_(\ me again
<Silver_Spoon> note the emoticon
<Polydunami> Oh -_(\ me again
<Petrified_Discord> Favorite ice cream flavors: GO
<Polydunami> Pistachio!
<Jmo> Bubblegum flavour.
<twilight_sprinkle> garbage flavor
<Silver_Spoon> fudge swirl
<Rain> the 4th flavor
<Polydunami> I want to try durian.
<Petrified_Discord> Rain: legendary
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: I prefer Edy's Pumpkin. Now THAT's best ice cream for me
<Silver_Spoon> I get chocolate -and- vanilla :)
<NocturnalBlade> Silver_Spoon: yes, same here
<Petrified_Discord> Cookies n cream
<Rain> glad someone picked up on that ref, Petrified_Discord :3
<Petrified_Discord> Rain: :)
<Silver_Spoon> Rain: Kids next door for the win /)
<Rain> (\
<JESmith71> Too bad you can't get it year round...
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith71: never heard of it tbh
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith71: is it a halloween thing?
<Polydunami> Sounds like a thanksgiving thing to me.
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: It's a limied flavor they only sell it around Octover and November
<JESmith71> October
*Silver_Spoon is gettin' sleepy
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith71: then the season is almost neigh, i should be on the lookout
<Petrified_Discord> I'd say the strangest flavor I've ever had was cinnamon. It's odd to have a cinnamon flavored treat that isn't hot, but cold. :/
<Silver_Spoon> goodnight everypony
<NocturnalBlade> nite Silver_Spoon
<MirrorImage> *snrk* eheh... more of SimGretina's randomness made the front page it seems
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Silver_Spoon
<kirz|GW2> lol, went from yellow to gray from just making iron ingots
<twilight_sprinkle> why am i not asleep, i have physics in less than 6 hours...
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: Because you are a true hero
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: more like a true idiot <.<
<Meanwhile> Tell me about it.
<Ninjazz> Because sleep is never important.
<Meanwhile> I powered through iron so easy but didn't think to leave some of it as ore instead of bars, could've gone into steel.
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: No way! Like, this level of heroic: http://derpy.me/pt6Mt
<Ninjazz> And don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
<kirz|GW2> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: the drowning guy?:D
<Meanwhile> Oh right.
<Meanwhile> You didn't know that.
<Petrified_Discord> YES
<Petrified_Discord> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: ok, that doctor almost had me convinced, but i believe you
<Meanwhile> You need iron ore for steel bars.
<Ninjazz> It's /always/ a good idea to believe me. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> tim for midnight snacks!
<Polydunami> Well, being a hero and an idiot seem to go hand in hand most of the time :D

<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: i only watch the news about norway, TV2 and NRK1
<TheRandomkid321> I'm surised this game even sold. Being a stealth based game. Not saying I don't like them but for some reason nowadays unless your firing like a madman every 10 seconds it's "not fun".
<Eli> TheRandomkid321: that's why i loved portal so much. firing like a madman
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love stealth games :)
<TheRandomkid321> And the twelve year olds called it gay.
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: That is because all they play is CoD and they still think gay is an insult
<mentallyeffedguy> TheRandomkid321: i think stealth games are my favourites
<TheRandomkid321> I like stealh games I was saying that all the tweleve year olds buying it saying "Ohmehgawsh it haz gunz it must be aw50m3!!!!" Disliked it.
<Gold_Demona> Stealth games not fun, lol. Tell that to the people who made the Metal Gear Solid series. :P
<killerpony7733> Wrek gotta say your new way of playing while talking is alot more amusing :)
<Ninjazz> Sounds like a teacher.

<killerpony7733> So yes he can read the chat
<TheRandomkid321> Oh and Wrek, thanks for banning me yesterday I honestly was being a total buckwit and I deserved it.
<mentallyeffedguy> TheRandomkid321: why did you push it on yourself? not excacly nececcery

<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: how long have you been playing now?
<Dragonmatte> ALL NORWEGIANS SHOULD TALK NYNORSK! xD
<Dragonmatte> xD
<Dragonmatte> So awesome
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: i talk bergensk :P
<Dragonmatte> Well i've got a norwegian friend on steam, i can never understand him when he talks norwegian xD
<Dragonmatte> But i do understand nynorsk ;3
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: he probably talks østlandsk
<Dragonmatte> Mhm
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: thats the worst kind of norsk
<Dragonmatte> xD
<Dragonmatte> Well i think i speak one of the easiest sorts of swedish
<mentallyeffedguy> it doesnt sound norwegian at all
<mentallyeffedguy> østlandsk that is
<Dragonmatte> Norrländska
<Dragonmatte> :3
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: kor er du i sverige?
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: did you understand that? :P
<Dragonmatte> Yep
<Dragonmatte> In the northern part :3
<Eli> :| i'm just gonna pretend i understand everything :
<Dragonmatte> Norrbotten
<Dragonmatte> xD
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: we now you understand us perfectly :)
<Dragonmatte> I love the sound for agreeing there, and i do mean sound
<Eli> söll i afo schwizerdütsch z rede? ir wäred alli gfiggt :P
<Dragonmatte> It's not a word xD
<Dragonmatte> Schhp or something like that xD
<Eli> translation to the above: should i start talking swiss german? you'd all be fucked :P
<Eli> not even germans understand me :(
<twilight_sprinkle> swiss german reminds me of ROOOOOOGER FEDERERRRRRRRRRRR
<Eli> fun fact: swiss german does not even have a past simple. and no defined grammar. you can write words just after how they sound :)
<Dragonmatte> It's not allowed to link youtube vids, right?
<Eli> Dragonmatte: you could ask Wrek for permission
<Dragonmatte> Okai :3
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: you and your Roger Federer...
<Dragonmatte> I guess that turret... Backfired
<Dragonmatte> YEEEEEAAAAAH
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: HES THE BEST OF ALL TIME MJLGNIWOJNFMIWOENFMWIOFWOEFG
<Dark_Horst> it sure sounds fantastc
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i think so too, but you'ree more of a fan than most guys from here :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: most people here dont know much about tennis <.< but the most important thing to know is that Federer is da best! oh and hes playing today :3
<mentallyeffedguy> hørt om svensken som aldri gikk ut med kona fordi han hadde hørt at det var galt å gå ut med gifte kvinner?
<Dragonmatte> :3
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i hate the people who said things like "I'm such a fan of Federer" and as soon as he wasn't number one any more, turned their backs on him. he's still the greatest
<Dragonmatte> I love that in sweden, the one who is stupid is always the noregian, and im guessing that in norway, the swedes are the stupid ones? xD
<mentallyeffedguy> yupp, apperantly we hate each other :P
<Dragonmatte> xD
<mentallyeffedguy> keep the chat english? whaaaaaat? for 100 kr
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: yeah, i believe theyre called 'glores', people who are only fans of the number 1. but hes back, and he showed em all again
<Dragonmatte> And i've heard finland and denmark doesn't like sweden either xD
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i know right? ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i really like his playing style as well, so graceful and nt boring defense
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: its only jokes though so thats good
<Dragonmatte> UUUUUUUGH i need some more of my fix >.<
<MadSurge> In Italy the dumb ones are the Carabinieri (ex-military police) :D
<Dragonmatte> Japp chokolate >.<
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: and he still can keep it up for hours!
<mentallyeffedguy> Dragonmatte: nammm
<Dragonmatte> Japp is so awesome
<mentallyeffedguy> fucking pie!
<Dragonmatte> And amazing
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: and years. 31 and playing better than top playeres at their peak age
<mentallyeffedguy> swedish pie :P
<Dragonmatte> And other awesome words
<twilight_sprinkle> i think this is the boss battle
<Dragonmatte> Even better then malteasers, Imo
<mentallyeffedguy> piegasm much? hehehehehe
<Dragonmatte> You need to put away the pie, ITS TOO GOOD!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: they should put Federer on the new swiss bills :)
<Dragonmatte> Our Blueberry smulpaj is BETTER! >:D
<Dragonmatte> >:3
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: who is federer?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: on the 100 one too :D he alreadry has stamps which is awesome too
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: WHO IS FEDERER? WHO IS FEDERER?!?!?!? WHO SI FDERERR?????WHQIDJIQFJMQFQN
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: i hope you're trollin, but he's a swiss tennis player
<Dragonmatte> I dont know either xD
<frakturfreak> mentallyeffedguy: A successful swiss tennis player
<frakturfreak> Is he number one again now?
<mentallyeffedguy> twilight_sprinkle: yes that was my question
<mentallyeffedguy> well i dont care much for tennis
<twilight_sprinkle> Federer is widely considered to be the greatest tennis player of all time, and one of the greatest athletes who ever lived
<Eli> Dragonmatte: if you hear tennis in the news, federer is usually the next word you hear
<Dragonmatte> Aha
<Dragonmatte> I dont care too much for tennis :3
<frakturfreak> But not knowing Federer, come on, I also really don’t care about tennis, but I know him
<twilight_sprinkle> and imo he might be the greatest athlete ever, hes just all-around physically balanced. he could probably play any sport excellently
<Eli> ^the definition of fan
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: no but seriously, even the commentatoras say so
<mentallyeffedguy> ive never heard of him until now
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: well remember the name!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i don't doupt Federer's greatness, i just find it funny
<mentallyeffedguy> twilight_sprinkle: i already forgot :P
<Dragonmatte> Hmm... What shall i play...
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: dont make me find you and grind it into your head >:I
<Dragonmatte> Tf2, Guild wars 2, or something else >.<
<mentallyeffedguy> guild wars 2 :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: hes an awesome guy too. wouldnt like him if he werent a nice person
<Dragonmatte> Do you have it?
<Malavolent> Afternoon, everybrony.
<Dragonmatte> Hewwow :3
<mentallyeffedguy> is their a rule here against talking anything but english?
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: he is. you know, celebs don't need bodyguards here in switzerland, i could probably meet him if i intended to. he lives close to my grandparents vacation house
<Dragonmatte> Yep, i think so...
<mentallyeffedguy> well thats stupid
<alexxm> how are you Malavolent
<Malavolent> Nothing out of ordinary alexxm, how about you?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: :O:O:O
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: you can still do it in privat chat
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: go give him a hug
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: itd be epic to get his autograph
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i saw him in person up close on a tourny once, but couldnt get an autograph
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: that wouldn't be too hard i guess. if i ever run into him, i'll ask for one for you :)
<Vivix> Wham!
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: get his autograph, wait till he dies, ????, profitt!
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: yaaaaaaaaay ty ty ty :)
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: oi, dont talk about that! >: (
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: if i run into him... no guarantees
<mentallyeffedguy> twilight_sprinkle: hey, im all about money
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i understand, hes elusive :D
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: >: (
<Vivix> mentallyeffedguy, thanks, now I got nicki minaj on my brain
<Vivix> Jmo!
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: hahahahaha!! didint think of that
<Vivix> hehehe
<twilight_sprinkle> and le boss battle
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: oh, he lives in Bottmingen.. i thought Gstaad... well...
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: hm, i thought Basel
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: that means i live 10 km to his house :P
<Eli> Bottmingen is in Basel.
<mentallyeffedguy> well "she" was ugy
<Sylandest> ...rihanna?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: woops :$
<mentallyeffedguy> ugly*
<Vivix> who now?
<Sylandest> never mind
<Sylandest> :D
<Vivix> everytime I read your name Sylandest I hear Sylandshest- which makes me think "Southern horses? wut?"
<Sylandest> Vivix: well, you're not far off. I am from the South, hehe :D
<Vivix> ooh hehe
<mentallyeffedguy> i want pepsi max!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i could go to his house in, i guess around 1h and take a pic ;P but i guess since he's not there it wouldn't make much sense
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: yeah, you should stalk him in the bushes near his house and jump out and ask for an autograph :D
<Vivix> When I was a kid, me and my sister went to this footballer shouse and asked for autograph, and he went inside for like 15 minutes, and came out with a presign printed card
<Vivix> like not even--actually signed, just printed
<Vivix> we were so dissapointed-
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: do you remember which footballer?
<Vivix> Roar Strand, norwegian gu y
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k
<Vivix> He was pretty big in norway back then- but yeah
<Eli> Vivix: Roger wouldn't do that. we don't do stuff like that here :P
<twilight_sprinkle> dont think Roger has any presigned stuff tho
<Vivix> hehe
<mentallyeffedguy> roooaaaaar straaaaaaaaaaaaaand!
<Vivix> I just got in so not sure who that is, but yeah
<Vivix> ROAAAHR

<Sumica> 00,10like she needs a pasport
<Sumica> 00,10so much lampshade
<SafariMonkey> SEP field. :P

<Sumica> 00,10so much death
<sonicandmario85> SO MUCH DEDS
<MirrorImage> "He was decapitated" "Very... icy"
<MirrorImage> seems legit
<Gold_Demona> "My goldfish, Goldy?" "Eaten by the cat."
<Gold_Demona> "The cat?" "Choked on the goldfish."
<NocturnalBlade> for some reason i dont trust her -_-
<MirrorImage> NocturnalBlade - the mayor? for good reason
<Sumica> 00,10ewwwwwwwww
<NocturnalBlade> ewwwwww
<sonicandmario85> SHES AN ALIEN!
<sonicandmario85> OH GOD
<sonicandmario85> RUN
<KwakLad> I think the main concern is, 'eww humans around'
<sonicandmario85> shes an ugly alien DX
<Sumica> 00,10she's got feels
<KwakLad> i know right, why does she have to stand in front of the mirror?
<Sumica> 00,109th is kinda rude
<SafariMonkey> foreshadowing? Turn left?
<sonicandmario85> Sumica:is this 9th?
<SafariMonkey> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<sonicandmario85> Sumica:are we gonna get to 10 soon? i wanna see the weeping angels so badly...
<Gold_Demona> I like 9th. I have a soft spot for mildly grumpy guys. =P
<Sumica> 00,10npe
<ingwaz> wait...their "arms" are their phones?
<Derpy_at_work> sumica streaming doctor again?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Derpy_at_work
<Derpy_at_work> cool
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: We won't get to the weeping angels for a long time.
<sonicandmario85> till the season ends?
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: Not until series (season) 3, this is series 1. Blink is (IIRC) episode 5 of series 3.
<Sumica> 00,10jumpen jack
<ingwaz> FAIL
<Gold_Demona> Jack be nimble. Jack be quick.
<Everlasting_Joy> sonicandmario85: There are about 20 episodes before we get to "Blink."
<sonicandmario85> well it isnt too long
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this part :).
<SafariMonkey> Blink is s3e10
<Everlasting_Joy> SafariMonkey: Thank you :).
<ingwaz> SafariMonkey: the original s3 or the newer seasons?
<Sumica> 00,10no I ment what have I done recently
<Sumica> 00,10syrse 3 seasion 3
<SafariMonkey> ingwaz: I thought s3 was easier than s29
<SafariMonkey> on the newbs
<ingwaz> safari, was not sure, havent seen much of doctor who personally, good show, just havent seen a lot of it
<Everlasting_Joy> Bad Wolf.
<Sumica> 00,10bad wolf
<Gold_Demona> Dun dun duuuuunnnn
<Sumica> 00,10mood swing
<Everlasting_Joy> I love that about this show, there's this overarcing theme throughout the series.
<SafariMonkey> ingwaz: Newb isn't an insult
<ingwaz> SafariMonkey: didnt take it as one, just a simple statement.
<Sumica> 00,10hah
<Gold_Demona> Noob is an insult, but not newb
<Sumica> 00,10"how did you get the outside around the inside"
<Everlasting_Joy> I love these parts with the Doctor and her.
<SafariMonkey> ingwaz: Nor was I saying you were. Direct answer: New series
<MadSurge> Hello Sumica <3
<ingwaz> nope, sorry, you were condemned for other reasons
<Sumica> 00,10hi MadSurge
<ingwaz> lol, weak guilt trips have little effect on me
<Sumica> 00,10yeah no, she planed to blow up the planet
<Sumica> 00,10she killed many already
<MadSurge> Sumica: I hope SlurryMoon gets in today, I got him some presents :D
<ingwaz> exactly sumica
<ingwaz> that alone is a crime punishable by death
<Everlasting_Joy> I love how she tries to say they are no better then her, despite the fact they are bringing the hammer of justice on her.
<ingwaz> Everlasting_Joy: its easy to try and twist those who dispense justice on themselves
<Sumica> 00,10yeah he will be on later
<ingwaz> wait...i thought the companion was usually the doctors girl? or thave they not progressed that far
<Everlasting_Joy> ingwaz: Right, right. I just find it funny on who is saying "are you better then me?"
<Sumica> 00,10with the 9th, she already had a boyfriend
<Dark_Horst> hey, just got here, what's happened so far?
<ingwaz> Everlasting_Joy: easy tactic commonly used by villians. villians who kill others and are defeated by heroes who have to kill are easily able to point out that the hero is killing as well
<Sumica> 00,10yeah this ep kinda lacks
<ingwaz> a bit
<Everlasting_Joy> ingwaz: Yep.
<Everlasting_Joy> I love the resturant scene.
<Sumica> 00,10it gives her 30 seconds of feels
<Sumica> 00,10and we some how have to buy this whole guilt
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<ingwaz> Sumica: she was going to destroy the planet simply to get off it. i feel pretty much no guilt at sending her back home where she has an execution order waiting for her
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Yet the Doctor and company still bring her home.
<SafariMonkey> Should have a live TV Tropes list: every time you notice one, you add it to the list
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<ingwaz> well...i would say the doctors a fool, but apparently not
<Sumica> 00,10plans to blow up the planet twice.
<ingwaz> lol
<Gold_Demona> denied!
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Gold_Demona> Thrics denied XD
<Gold_Demona> thrice*
<ingwaz> oh doctor, you're quite well prepared
<ingwaz> apparently she cant shut up about the doctor...shes a bad date bro
<ingwaz> poor guy
<Sumica> 00,10wonder how much time has passed for mickie
<Sumica> 00,10Doctor is wise to her
<Everlasting_Joy> It's moments like these that make me love 9th Doctor.
<MadSurge> Neneneneneneneee
<SafariMonkey> The lady she saved
<SafariMonkey> finally I love this bit
<Everlasting_Joy> Darn it! I won't be able to finish this episode. Oh well, I must depart. Farewell good folks!
<SafariMonkey> the doctor's reaction
<Sumica> 00,10mickey are you thick or some thing?
<ingwaz> stupid, the doctors got a time machine thingy, of course i'd run to him
<MadSurge> Thick is an understatement
<Dark_Horst> oh look, torchwood HQ
<ingwaz> ....STREAM why you freeze at horrible times
<Kandarihu|OldComp> ingwaz, is your Firefox freezing when the stream freezes?
<MadSurge> It just went CRAYYYYZEEEE
<ingwaz> Kandarihu|OldComp: I USE CHROME
<ingwaz> -CAPS
<Kandarihu|OldComp> ingwaz, ah. Uh.... never mind. Sorry.

<Vordox> Wtf happened....?
<Vordox> IT IS THE HOLY ARK

<Pinkie123> Who's streaming?
<MadSurge> Pinkie123: Sumica
<ingwaz> well, somebody is pissy
<Vordox> Doctor being.... the doctor.
<MadSurge> Pinkie123: You can learn who's streaming by seeing which OC is on the screen :D
<Kinixys> Second chance. LOL
<Vordox> ...

<MadSurge> EXTERMINAAAAATE
<ingwaz> Kencolt: looks hilarious to me
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: What?
<Kencolt> I have seen every episode of the series-- except for the lost ones from Series One-- ever made.
<MadSurge> RECAP
<Kencolt> I know what of what I speak.
<Kinixys> How many episodes is that Kencolt?
<Dark_Horst> was that the shaun of the dead guy?
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: why skip episode?
<Sumica> 00,10huh?
<Sumica> 00,10who skiped?
<Kencolt> I'm not sure. First series, it was mostly 4 episode serials, except when it wasn't.. and everything here is 1 or 2 parters.
<MadSurge> SafariMonkey: that was a previous episode recap
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony :)
<NocturnalBlade> hi BronyInstrumental
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello BronyInstrumental :)
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Sorry, thougt you'd do the previous one? first.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol reality show ?
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Sorry, I'll leave it.
<BronyInstrumental> just got back from school and oh? doctor who!
<Gold_Demona> lol, the Ann-droid
<MadSurge> Sumica: he thought the giant worm air conditioner episode was the one before this one
<Sumica> 00,10it was before this but not directly
<Gold_Demona> Sounds like they actually got Ann Robinson to do the voice. That's brilliant. XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol i use to watch that show
<MadSurge> JACK
<MadSurge> Dem fembots
<Sumica> 00,10ohmy

<Sumica> 00,10bigbrother 504
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: I know, i didn't realise it was in exact order
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: THE SONIC DOESN'T DO WOOD!
<ingwaz> that was weird...facebook told me someone in japan just accessed my account
<ingwaz> anyone ever have that happen before?
<Gold_Demona> ingwaz: I've had that happen once, but someone in India instead. I suggest you change your password.
<ingwaz> did, just odd that they would get my password since i dont use predictable ones... shall have to do a system scan
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<XylemTube> What kinda freaky game show am i watching/
<Sumica> 00,10torchwood

<XylemTube> oh god. big brother is still running D:
<MadSurge> DED TOO
<Sumica> 00,10sooooooooooooo, why would any one want to be on game shows?
<Gold_Demona> They wouldn't. They get randomly chosen and yoinked into them. =/
<Kencolt> Apparently, no-one DOES.
<Gold_Demona> Just like the Doctor, Rose, and Jack did
<KwakLad> We are Borg!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you win! You're not the Weakest Link! :)
<shibaru> Ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> soo in the future they use wooden rackets again?..
<XylemTube> OH MAI
<Gold_Demona> As in off with your face. :D
*Sumica chokes

<Sumica> 00,10bad wolf corp
<Kencolt> And the definition of "pulling it our of his ass" has been PRECICESLY Defined.
<Gold_Demona> Droog
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: and "blow it out your ass"?
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Good one.
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai everypony. Ohai Doctor
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Petrified_Discord
<NocturnalBlade> hi Petrified_Discord
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Petrified_Discord
<Petrified_Discord> :)
<Kencolt> For those who don't get the "pay for my licence" joke, in the UK, you actually have to pay a regular licence fee for your TV sets, and to recieve programming.
<SafariMonkey> hi Petrified_Discord
<MadSurge> Ohai Petrified_Discord!
<Sumica> 00,10nice gun jack
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: I'm sure some non-brits will appreciate your explanation. :)
<MadSurge> DEDBOTS :D
<Kencolt> SafariMonkey: Just making sure.
<Gold_Demona> I know I did. Thanks Kencolt. =)
<Kencolt> SafariMonkey: TOLD you.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Sounds like what Cable TV is in the USA... but is this for broadcast TV? Do you have to pay a license to watch broadcast TV?
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: No, I told YOU!
<Petrified_Discord> Bear with me
<MadSurge> Kandarihu|OldComp: same for italian tv, mind you
<Sumica> 00,10and now you know why they flashed back to that
<Kencolt> Kandarihu|OldComp: Yes. Mostly because at the start of UK television, every network was part of the Government.
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: ALL tv needs a licence if it's live
<Gold_Demona> So wait, when you say a license for your tv set, do you mean for the actual machine as well as the service to watch the programming??
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: To watch TV as it is broadcast you need a licence
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Well, that's government for you.
<Petrified_Discord> Not compatable? KICK THE SHIT
<Gold_Demona> I see. So it's like Cable then.
<MadSurge> Inb4 she gets shot
<Gold_Demona> lol dat Face of Boe
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: Well, it pays for the BBC (not the government), So it pays for doctor who.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Gold_Demona, except it's for broadcast TV.
<Gold_Demona> Right
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: except it's shitty national channels :D
<magmablock> 6_9
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Kandarihu|OldComp> SafariMonkey, and how do the British who are not fans of Dr. Who feel about this?
<MadSurge> That robot has the -__- expression constantly :D
<Gold_Demona> Ann is rarely impressed
<Gold_Demona> The whole time she was the host of the American version of Weakest Link, I've only seen her crack up like once.
<Kencolt> SafariMonkey: If I'm not mistaken most popular sports broadcasts and news are BBC?
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I know that it's said that all the British love Doctor Who, but there are always exceptions for claims that EVERYONE is part of a certain fandom.
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: I believe so
<MadSurge> DED
<XylemTube> :O
<Gold_Demona> Nuuuuuuu, Rose is ded! D:
<Petrified_Discord> And then Rose was totally dead. Yup. Absolutely.
<Kencolt> Thus... a LOT of people pay for that, and also the licence covers a lot of popular imports and te like.
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: It pays for national television. Bonus is 0% advertising!
<magmablock> No music would make this scene much more potent
<MadSurge> Petrified_Discord: can't you believe it? But it's so convincing!
<BronyInstrumental> i'm a brit and i don't particularly like dr who :/
<SafariMonkey> magmablock: You got your wish
<MadSurge> Howdy BronyInstrumental :)
<Petrified_Discord> Dat security
<XylemTube> Lol. Nice security
<magmablock> I was talking about the scene where Rose got vaporized, but a lot of scenes work
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<BronyInstrumental> hi MadSurge, i got here a while ago :S
<MadSurge> PERFECT SECURITY
<NocturnalBlade> hi GilDash
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash!
<BronyInstrumental> hi GilDash #
<Petrified_Discord> Withagun!
<Kencolt> In a society where they expect eveyone to obey-- and everyone does-- resistance is totally effective.
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: yeah, but I just noticed
<MadSurge> :D
<SafariMonkey> that is one BFG
<Petrified_Discord> Eccleston Doctor doesn't take shit from ANYONE. Fukken LOVE that guy.
<Gold_Demona> He's also a bit of a grouch. I liked that about him. =)
<Kandarihu|OldComp> SafariMonkey, you know what? Commercials aren't really all that bad. It sure beats having to pay for everything you see on TV. And the breaks are good times to take breaks, or even mentally digest the act of the show.
<Gold_Demona> Not TOO grouchy, but enough to be interesting
<MadSurge> Nice existence, being the processor of a computer since the age of 5
<Kandarihu|OldComp> MadSurge, sounds like a fate worse than death to me.
<Petrified_Discord> Commercials are awesome. They research what we want to buy and present it in a clear and usually amusing fashion. They're doing the shopping for us!
<Kencolt> Gold_Demona: He's really fresh from the Time Wars, and Number 8 who fought it-- it's still fresh to his mind.
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: Yeah, I take breaks, but do you realise that about 30% of your viewing time is advertising?
<Gold_Demona> Kencolt: Yesh
<Dark_Horst> heckler and koch must make a killing in the future
<MadSurge> NOT DED
<Kandarihu|OldComp> SafariMonkey, I'd imagine that would be unbearable for someone who isn't used to it.
<XylemTube> DAT FAKE DEATH
<Petrified_Discord> WHAT A TWIST!
<MadSurge> Inb4 EXTERMINATE
<Gold_Demona> Let's do the plot twist dance!
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: I don't watch continuously,
<magmablock> I knew it! My Dalek sense was tingling like mad
<MadSurge> OH NO!
<Kinixys> Daleks are always behind everything.
<SafariMonkey> I just don't like having only 70% yield on my time
<magmablock> And I just relaized how stupid taht sounds
<Dark_Horst> is that a pilot suit?
<NocturnalBlade> was wondering when these guys would show up
<magmablock> Anyone seen Asylum of the Daleks?
<Kinixys> Gotta go. Have fun!
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Some of these commercials are pretty entertaining in their own right.
<SafariMonkey> magmablock: yes, but don't spoil it for all the others.
<magmablock> of course
<magmablock> SPOILERS: It contains Daleks
<Petrified_Discord> magmablock: :O
<Kencolt> magmablock: I have BBC America. Saw it at US premere.
<Zawan> magmablock: too many bad puns
<MadSurge> They're not THAT many
<Petrified_Discord> Eccleston's most famous speech inbound
<MadSurge> :D
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: I appreciate that.
<magmablock> No.
<Petrified_Discord> magmablock: EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: £150 a year.
<Dark_Horst> haha xD
<Petrified_Discord> No weapons + no defenses + no plan + The Doctor = You're fucked :/
<SafariMonkey> So many daleks it's like the parliament
<Kencolt> Kandarihu|OldComp: Which is cheaper than cable at the least.
<KwakLad> fools everyone of them
<Maid_RainBow> have to go everypony Bye bye
<KwakLad> he has a John Barrowman, is that not the greatest weapon?
<NocturnalBlade> bye Maid_RainBow
<Sumica> 00,10So next ep?
<Petrified_Discord> KwakLad: Some Daleks think they can outsmart me...*sniff*. Maybe...maybe. I have yet to meet one that can outsmtart Barrowman.
<spitfirecolt> i always hated this doctor but the rest is better
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Kencolt, the reason why cable is so expensive is because the subscribers are paying for each of the channels they receive. The most expensive of these are the ESPN channels, because they broadcast Football, and pay for Football players' salaries.
<XylemTube> I have a better idea... Lets watch the Running Man
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica next ep.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :p
<Gold_Demona> Yay, moar who!
<Kencolt> Kandarihu|OldComp: I know. FOrtunately,my cable bundle is wel built.. and it includes my phone and internet.
<Gold_Demona> Daleks. Daleks everywhere.
<Wirisme> Oh yay more who!
<Wirisme> Hi everyone!
<Petrified_Discord> She will be eksturrmeenatid
<NocturnalBlade> hi Wirisme
<spitfirecolt> hay
<MLP_Brovakiin> hey Wirisme
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Wirisme
<Wirisme> excuse me, everPONY :D
<Kencolt> And I don't buy the sports channels, because I could not care less.
<Snow> im just here for 2 mins now and i have no idea whats this is.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soo what doctor is this one ?
<Petrified_Discord> Snow: Cylinder robots are taking over the world with television
<Dark_Horst> The_Browncoat: 9th, i think
<magmablock> END OF SERIES
<XylemTube> ^
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Kencolt, it's kind of risky to bundle your phone service with the same company you have your TV and Internet service from. If there's a billing problem with your TV/Internet provider, they'll yank your service, and you'll have to phone them to straighten things out.
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu|OldComp: BBC does football, I don't know how it works though
<Kencolt> End of season, you mean,. Fun fact-- Eccleston 's contract was for One Year-- because he'd decided to play the role for only one year, since he had other commitments-- but he had to take the role just once.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I heard once that if your phone is part of that bundle, the same billing problem that cuts off your TV and Internet also cuts off your phone service. So it'll be harder to sort things out.
<MadSurge> Now, why don't they ALWAYS carry a gun to kill Daleks instead of comically running away from them? :D
<Snow> okay i have never seen doctor who, so i dont know the plot... im clueless atm xD
<Kencolt> MadSurge: Becaue most weapons don't WORK against Daleks.
<magmablock> Wow, Nine has a huge nose
<Wirisme> I just go with it, I never watched it until the other day either
<MadSurge> Kencolt: but the ones that DO work, they never carry them around!

<twilight_sprinkle> boooo
<Snow> that was a lame pun...
<Pinkie8910> What eoisode is this?
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome|Homework: I know, I wasn't sure what he meant, and twilight_sprinkle, I know
<KwakLad> 'I think you need a doctor' *Ding Dong* *Hello Sailor* and all that jazz
<twilight_sprinkle> did she just transfer a disease to him?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> SafariMonkey: Oh, ok. Sorry. :$
<Snow> dat breath!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> twilight_sprinkle: I think he got his powers back.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> So I'm guessing Rose is dead?
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome|Homework: No Problem, I probably would have reacted the same to my ambiguous query.
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome|Homework: biiiitch be dead yes
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Nope.avi. Just give the good doctor a bit to explain it.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Homework: i was making a veneric disease joke:P (if i translated the name right)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: And because Rose literally brought him back from the dead, he can't die now.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> twilight_sprinkle: Oh. Sorry. :$
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: venereal
<mentallyeffedguy> dammit i was wrong

<Snow> o.o
<SafariMonkey> Oh this joke
<twilight_sprinkle> its still fonneh
<Snow> what if derpy was rose in that scene?
<Snow> that would have been awsome i guess
<Bronysith> MOST EPIC REGENERATION
<SafariMonkey> And he becoms SO MUCH BETTER
<MadSurge> UND DANN DAVID TENNANT
<SafariMonkey> Takes a level in AWESOME
<Bronysith> Fun Fact : this is the first regeneration when the doctor is standing
<Wirisme> WUT
<Wirisme> Everythings fine, oh wait no i'm dying
<Petrified_Discord> Imagine if the 9th, 10th, and 11th Doctors had a crossover?
<Pinkie8910> What episode is this?!
<SafariMonkey> Bronysith: I love the regen supercuts
<twilight_sprinkle> her lips man
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> How many episodes did they have of the 9th doctor?
<MadSurge> Petrified_Discord: there is no 11th doctor :D
<mentallyeffedguy> the episode of magic light
<magmablock> 13, I think
<XylemTube> ded?
<Petrified_Discord> MadSurge: Matt Smith

<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Homework: this is?...
<Masdragonflare> 6_9
<Kandarihu|OldComp> This is David Tennant, right?
<Snow> *mind blown*
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: matter of opinion
<XylemTube> g2g bye
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu|OldComp: *ding ding ding*
<MadSurge> Yep, David Tennant
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: there is no best doctor, there is only... the doctor
<twilight_sprinkle> if that was best doctor, then i am dissappoint
<Kencolt> I LIKE Matt Smith. He reminds me o Tom Baker. And Colin Baker. Kind of in a blender.
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Of the new series, *by far*
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Oh, I didn't notice you giving me permission. I hope I wasn't too late.
<Wirisme> by xylem
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: I know. I was talking about most of the fanbase's favorite doctors.

<Snow> WHUT!?
<Sumica> 00,10Lunch time
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Thank, Sumica for the stream. :)
<SafariMonkey> Kencolt: top 3 doctors to the expert are?
<MadSurge> Awww Sumica's done
<Petrified_Discord> Thanks Sumica :)
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: there is a Picard, Kirk relationship between tennant and baker really
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: those 2 are the most popular
<Kandarihu|OldComp> He's off to lunch.
<MadSurge> Thanks for the stream Sumica!
<Snow> wait
<Gold_Demona> Thanks for stream Sumi
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: Okay.
<Snow> is that g1 applejack in that bubble!?
<Wirisme> Thanks Sumica
<NocturnalBlade> have a nice lunch Sumica
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Snow: Yes.
<mentallyeffedguy> what are we watching now?! mlp in the 80s?
<Bronysith> Sumica: have some spicy subs
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> mentallyeffedguy: Yep.
<Petrified_Discord> mentallyeffedguy: Sumica's end-of-stream clip
<mentallyeffedguy> hahahahaha thats funny
<MadSurge> EETS BACON AND APOLJECK! DERE AWWRITE!
<Kencolt> In my humble opinion? Well, Tom Baker is iconic to me (Number 4, the one with the scarf), and yes, David Tennant, and Peter Davison.
<magmablock> We almost died, it was great!
<magmablock> 11 is best doctor
<magmablock> It's stll very close, though
<Gold_Demona> I like 11. He took a little getting used to, but I ended up really liking him
<Pinkie8910> Who's streaming next?
<Kandarihu|OldComp> magmablock, Almost what?
<Jmo> TOM BAKER OR GTFO.
<Wirisme> Is Sumica streaming after lunch?
<Snow> i have no idea what i just watched. i know its g1 but those...sea ponies.
<Jmo> kthxjellybabies.
<Snow> they scare me
<Gold_Demona> lol Snow
<Petrified_Discord> Snow: Look at the 4th panel :P http://equestria.fadri.org/043-next-season-on-my-little-pony
<Jmo> ^Win
<Wirisme> if you're gonna have a deus ex machina, what better way?
<Kencolt> I DO like Smith's doctor. As I said, he's like a mix of the Fourth (the most eccentric at times) and the Sixth (Who was often on the verge of insanity-- he had a bad regeneration).
<Bronysith> http://www.dorkly.com/comic/43673/videogame-company-poker

<Bronysith> Wrek: dat shadowmourne

<Masdragonflare> Oh, Wrek? Have you decided what pony combination you'll drawn? I saw some question thingy about what pony you should drawn (or somthing) on your devionART page

<alexxm> he's good
<Masdragonflare> unless you don't need them ofcrouse :)
<Kencolt> Wrek: I kind of think it would be amusing to see twilght Sparkle in Majot Katsuragi (from GiTS) uniform.
<SafariMonkey> Before you ask my down speed id 45 Mb per second
<SafariMonkey> *is
<Kencolt> If you can call that a uniform.
<SafariMonkey> *by down speed I mean to the internet not the router
<SafariMonkey> Believe it or not in the culture I lived in in africa they didn't put walls around wells (30m+) because they believed that if someone fell that was God's will. So this isn't too far from the present.
<MadSurge> Well, that fish dinner was delicious :)
<MadSurge> PONY
<Bronysith> its amazing what 30 minutes of swordplay can do
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: THAT must've been..... a lot of fish

<Bronysith> MadSurge: gurren lagann?

<Safari_eating> Wrek: Most of us. :P
<Vivix> We can all sit here and powertranslate, it will be the worst experience ever for our foreign amtes
<mentallyeffedguy> wrek has actually changed all of the subtitles just to troll us

<Obsidian> Wrek: We're screwed either way because of poor translations

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> inb4 worse translation than the first
<Vivix> Eh he was the kings main bowman or something- and he said the kings bow was too weak for him, when his own broke in battle
*Safari_eating prepares food before he misses more awesome action
<alexxm> i thought the film was good
<PillowPoni> I don't know Swedish at all. This will be a fun ride
<MLP_Brovakiin> Use google translate :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: We're counting on you to translate for us should it be bad ;).
<Obsidian> Wrek: We'll see
<Vivix> "Oh king, oh king, your bow is too weak" or something
<cowvarkian> a horse, my kingdom for a horse...
<Meanwhile> Wrek can do facecam and be the like the guy who reads to the deaf folks in sign language.

<Meanwhile> cowvarkian why would you read to blind people in sign language?
<cowvarkian> why not
<Meanwhile> Because they can't see?
<MLP_Brovakiin> mentallyeffedguy: You'll be fine
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> mentallyeffedguy: That depends? What sits have you been going to?
<Vivix> None of my friends cared- but I don't know if your agegroup cares about it?
<mentallyeffedguy> MLP_Brovakiin: no, i wont, none of my friends are bronies
<Vivix> Is MLP even well known outside of the norwegian bronies?
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome|Homework: this one...equestria daily and that sorta stuff
<Meanwhile> Need icecream. :3
<Vivix> I don't think anyone would recognize it if I wore a shirt
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> mentallyeffedguy: Pfft! You'll be fine.
<mentallyeffedguy> ill be staying in the closet
<cowvarkian> Vivix: yeah, because no one outside of norway watches an american show
<MLP_Brovakiin> mentallyeffedguy: Neiter are any of mine, if they are truelly your friends they will get over it. hopefully
<mentallyeffedguy> patrik olterman! you better be a good translater!
<Vivix> Whatnow? That's not really close to anything I said
<cowvarkian> I know
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> mentallyeffedguy: Most of my friends aren't bronies, and I couldn't really care if they see me watching ponies or not.
<Dusty> so is this part 2?
<Vivix> What I mean is that I've not met anyone who cares outside of fans around these parts
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Dusty: Eeyup.
<Safari_eating> Did I miss anything?
<Patricia> Are we watching it again?
<cowvarkian> sure

<Obsidian> Wrek: Let us know when it starts to go south
<cowvarkian> and i still don't understand why dogs testicles are any better then regular ones
<tSparx> The dog's bollocks? I'm pretty sure those are bad.
<Wrek> 05tSparx: actually no
<Wrek> 05british slang
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: It is an old saying :P
<mentallyeffedguy> cowvarkian: logic does not need to occur
<cowvarkian> tSparx: no, for some reason the dogs bollocks are good
*Vivix makes innappropriate zoophilia joke
<tSparx> Well, I should rephrase: I don't like dogs' bollocks.
<SafariMonkey> Translation: Bee's knees
<cowvarkian> elephant's anus
<CK|GW2> Brosa? That's way too close to Brona. My inner nerd is telling me to go questing for the Sword of Shannara just in case.
<Vivix> hehe
<cowvarkian> ikr
<tSparx> I recognize the Britons' slang, but I prefer bees' knees to dogs' bollocks :D
<Eli> SafariMonkey: i'm pretty sure bees don't have knees...
<MLP_Brovakiin> SafariMonkey: or the cat's pajamas
<CCCP-> Wrek how'd you become a mod?
<cowvarkian> CCCP-: what time rift did you pop out of
<mentallyeffedguy> CCCP-: good fucking question

<Wrek> 05wnt*
<tSparx> cowvarkian: He came with the Dalek's WAY back in the Eccelston era and has just been waiting to get back to this.
<Vivix> hehe
<Meanwhile> True story.
<CCCP-> cowvarkian I was watching you sleep
<cowvarkian> ah, seems legit, tSparx
<SafariMonkey> mentallyeffedguy: I don't see how that question is relevant to sexual intercourse...
<Eli> Wrek spelling went...
<cowvarkian> CCCP-: I can believe that
<Vivix> Horziezz
<cowvarkian> ikr SafariMonkey
<PillowPoni> Hoers
<mentallyeffedguy> SafariMonkey: it just is
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: Then you don't have a very active imagination :P

<Meanwhile> Lesson learned.
<Vivix> Wrek yeap- historically accurate
<PillowPoni> Wrek: Just like a Razorback
<cowvarkian> or on your back, Wrek

<cowvarkian> wait, why is this suddenly english
<Aircrafter> Runnnn
<Vivix> they're in an international part with multinational people
<SafariMonkey> Subtitles are bad literal translation.
<Obsidian> cowvarkian: Has ENglish speaking moments
<Meanwhile> The languages change all over the place.
<cowvarkian> I can believe that
<cowvarkian> because you know, scandinavia
<Meanwhile> Aimbot.

<Vordox> Vivix: Swedish and Norwegian is actually some difference with words and their own languages.
<Vivix> hehe
<mentallyeffedguy> just saying
<Vivix> oh yeah it's very different
<Vordox> Same with Danish as well
<Vivix> I'm Norwegian
<Aircrafter> ale.
<Vordox> Then you know what I mean :D
<mentallyeffedguy> øøøøøøøøll
<Vivix> yeaah
<Meanwhile> Ul ul ul ul ululululululu
<Everlasting_Joy> I could use an ale right now.
<Vordox> Viking ALE
<Vordox> For parties!
<Wrek> 05ÖL FÖR ALLA!
<Vivix> Skavlan has that weird norwegian with swedish words shoehorned in, it's odd to listen to
<mentallyeffedguy> ølølløløløløløløløløløløl
<Zawan> ÖL!
<Vordox> (Imagines that Pinkie is a viking)
<mentallyeffedguy> the new trolololoool
<SafariMonkey> I can understand 90% of norwegian and 50% of swedish... Pretty different, but really similar. :/
<Meanwhile> Öl erryday.
<Vivix> Øl! Øl! Og mere øl! da da da da
<Aircrafter> Vordox: You just won, ALLL my internets.
<Eli> Wrek: isn't that what a terrorist says before blowing up?
<Vivix> I can understand maybe 40-50 percent Swedish, some of the words are just--so different
<Vordox> Öl Party style!
<mentallyeffedguy> i can do french :P
<Vivix> I kinda want to learn Samisk
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Same. Also mentallyeffedguy same too
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: so do I... i still don't like it
<Vordox> Sami!?
*MLP_Brovakiin doesn't speak a word of what ever languages are being typed/ spoken
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: french sucks really
<Patricia> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> LEARN ALL THE LANGUAGES!!!
<Vivix> Yeah, I think Sami sounds kinda cool
<Vordox> Yeah sure it's a Beautiful languages, but the very roots of their pronounciations is REALLY different.
<Vivix> Lulu Same or what it is around these parts
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: me too
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: i agree. I'm now in my 3d year at an all french school...
<Aircrafter> Everyone! I have something to say!
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: i hate it
<Aircrafter> Swedish. Spitfire.
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Written they are very similar, but spoken, the difference is accentuated
<cowvarkian> Aircrafter: your point
<Vivix> aah
<mentallyeffedguy> Eli: worst languege. EVER
<cowvarkian> mentallyeffedguy: far from it
<Vivix> I like french too-
<Aircrafter> cowvarkian: Swedish. Spitfire.
<Spectrum_Rush> cowvarkian: you've never heard swedish spitfire?
<Vivix> I like most languages
<mentallyeffedguy> doesnt even make sense, its just many sounds
<Vordox> Convictions does a man good and bad.
<Meanwhile> Awkward conversationalist Arn.
<WindWhistler> mentallyeffedguy: I think you've confused French with Chinese
<mentallyeffedguy> Spectrum_Rush: i have :P
<MadSurge> DO YOU SEE THE FJORDS
<Eli> mentallyeffedguy: oh hell yeah!. my friends and i used to say: english is made of rules, french is made of exceptions :)
<Vivix> hehe
<WindWhistler> Chinese is the language that relies greatly on sounds
<mentallyeffedguy> WindWhistler: chinese is awesome
<Wrek> 05anotehr mug o mead chug anotehr mug o mead and another mug o mead 'til you fall down
<Meanwhile> I think you'll find that speech in general relies pretty greatly on sound.
<cowvarkian> aircrafter, I don't see a point to it
<Vivix> If I could, I'd learn all the languages, cause they're all so cool
<WindWhistler> Chinese is confusing. A change of pitch can change the meaning completely
<Vordox> Wrek: You are connected to Vikings? :p
<Vivix> That's true of many languages though
<Aircrafter> cowvarkian: Have you heard Swedish Spitfire?
<mentallyeffedguy> WindWhistler: do you know chinese?
<cowvarkian> yes
<Vordox> Rikissa died off screen!?
<WindWhistler> mentallyeffedguy: No, but I know that's how it works.
<Wrek> 05Vordox: hm?
<Vivix> like ..just change the beat and pitch of a normal word, mangles it completely
<Meanwhile> Chug a mug of mead and another mug of mead chug another mug of mead warrior.
<Aircrafter> cowvarkian: Well there you go. Thats my point.
<Meanwhile> Miracle of Sound.
<Eli> Meanwhile: that was genius :)
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I find the opposite. english has *so* many exceptions
<Meanwhile> Good stuff.
<Wrek> 05aknar bara ett skägg
<Vordox> Wrek: Vikinga blod. :)
<Wrek> 05men det e på väg så
<cowvarkian> Aircrafter: then your point is pointless
<Wrek> 05saknar*
<Aircrafter> cowvarkian: No, you are missing the point to my subject
<Vivix> Skarufådækjægg?
<Wrek> 05and more or less vordox yes
<WindWhistler> Well I'm gonna go since I apparently am too plain old American for this topic.
<cowvarkian> Aircrafter: No, I don't believe I am, and the point is pointless
<Vordox> Oh...
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care WindWhistler!
<Vordox> shit..
<MLP_Brovakiin> wer
<Obsidian> Bye WindWhistler
<Eli> SafariMonkey: what? english is like the easiest language ever! i never even payed attention to a single class in school, but stil i'm here :)
<Aircrafter> cowvarkian: How is Swedish Spitfire pointless?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh crap
<Vordox> Those eyes of the eminence..
<Vivix> I think I have Viking blood- I havent done much root research
<mentallyeffedguy> i want to learn russian, russians are so cool
<Aircrafter> All of a sudden, CAMEL
<Vivix> Russian looks nice, yeah
<Patricia> Camel!
<Meanwhile> Ohai.
<Vordox> LAWL
<WindWhistler> Maybe if I were born in some other country I'd be able to hold a single conversation.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek: How long is this film?
*WindWhistler is peeved
<Wrek> 052h
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thanks
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: do you have school tommorow?
<SafariMonkey> Eli: What nationality are you?
<Wrek> 05mentallyeffedguy: i got... 1 class
<Everlasting_Joy> I smell a double cross.
<Wrek> 05midday
<Eli> SafariMonkey: swiss
<Vordox> WELL THAT PROTECTION IS POINTLESS NOW
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: which takes about

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Wrek: Nice.
<SafariMonkey> sorry lost my rely to the up button
<SafariMonkey> Eli: Is it fair to say you watch (or have watched) a lot of english-speaking material?
<Vordox> Is it what I think he's going to do...
<Vivix> Don't hit the horse!
<mentallyeffedguy> i got a 5 in english, thats the good part of gaming :P
<Vivix> Lag at the action point!
<Vivix> what ahppened?
<Meanwhile> Bonk.
<Vordox> No weapon!
<Obsidian> One hit KO
<Sonny> I learned my English all on my own
<Vivix> Woo
<Meanwhile> Wombocombo.
<Vordox> As stated
<Eli> SafariMonkey: of course! i make use of this awesome language i learned! but i didn't learn it by watching stuff
<Vordox> Scandinavians...
<Vivix> I got a 5 in english too- and a 5 in math, and abo 3 in anything else
<Vordox> We don't need no steel
<Sonny> But I'm going to bed now
<Vivix> despite getting a five in english, my english is actually pretty bad
<Sonny> bye bye everypony
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Sonny: Night! :)
<BladedWings> nite Sonny
<Obsidian> Sleep well Sonny
<Aircrafter> bye Sonny.
<Sonny> :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Sonny!
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: english is my best fag
<mentallyeffedguy> lol
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Sonny
<Aircrafter> Wut.
<Spectrum_Rush> what a douche
<PillowPoni> NOT THE HORSIE!
<BladedWings> not the hoooooorse
<Vordox> MY HORSE
<mentallyeffedguy> sounds so wrong
<Vivix> It was mine too, but you know. capitalizing, comma rules, OH GO
<Vivix> Kill that fucker!
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I find that in many places people are so exposed to english, that they learn it relatively easily
<Vordox> Oh
<Obsidian> Oh its on now
<Vordox> NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Noo horsey D:
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Isn't it said that twins will sometimes have their own way of communicating with each other with their own language?
<cowvarkian> sure
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Dusty> why did he stab the horse
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> You killed Agro! You monsters!
<Meanwhile> Dusty: Because he was an ass.
<Vivix> That fucking bastard
<Everlasting_Joy> Dusty: Kill the transportation.
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome|Homework: My brother and I sota have that
<Dusty> yeah
<Vivix> Now I'm sad
<Vordox> Agro...
<Eli> SafariMonkey: yeah, naturaly... but it's still a choice
<BladedWings> :( this movie go real sad real quick
<BladedWings> *got
<Dusty> oh hes not deat. yet :(
<Aircrafter> I feel sad now. Poor horsie.
<PillowPoni> In loving memory of the horse.
*PillowPoni bows her head
<Dusty> ;(
<Obsidian> Saddest moment in the movie
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Dusty> :'(
*cowvarkian isnt sad
<thelonepony> :'( not the Horsie
<PillowPoni> A moment in silence for the horsie
*Vivix hugs horse
<Vordox> Love is a splendid thing, having no borders...
*BladedWings moment of silence for the horse
<Vordox> Amen
<Vivix> Is just an actor--
<Spectrum_Rush> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg
<Dusty> that horse is a good actor
<Aircrafter> Everyone be quiet, We need a moment of silence....
<mentallyeffedguy> that horses were just tools before, not much feelings invovled except maybe someone had a favourite horse
<SafariMonkey> Eli: Maybe I wasn't clear. English, I find, has as many exceptions as french, but greater exposure means they are less obvious.
<Vordox> mentallyeffedguy: O.o
<Vivix> Kinda, pit horses died a plenty, but a soldiers horse were his horse for like 20 years
<Vordox> mentallyeffedguy: SAY WHA?!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Spectrum_Rush: Haha :D
<mentallyeffedguy> Vordox: its true
<Vivix> half true
<Vordox> We have stories of horses that passed legendaries themselves.
<Vivix> transportation horses like in London--were unloved
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: eyupp
<shibaru> Hi.
<Vivix> but a farmers horse, a soldiers horse- especially a sargeants horse was hiis horse, his friend and such
<Aircrafter> Well then god is a real jackass.
<Eli> SafariMonkey: duuude... i go to a completly french school... my mothertongue is german. believe me: French has way more exceptions
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vivix: Everything in london is unloved...
<Michael> ohai everypony :D
<Aircrafter> Ohai Michael.
<Vivix> Hehe

<Michael> ohai MrMalk
<thelonepony> hi MrMalk
<Obsidian> Hello MrMalk
<BladedWings> hi MrMalk
<PillowPoni> Hi MrMalk
<cowvarkian> that guy has a nice mustache
<MrMalk> What we watching?
<Eli> since when MrMalk malk and not just Malk anymore?
<Aircrafter> 50 years ago: Someone wanted to know a word in another language, they would go out and learn it. Now: Google Translator.
<Michael> Templars? :o
<MrMalk> Oh its this movie I love it
<Cades> okay, you?
<mentallyeffedguy> what a douche
<MrMalk> This is a Great movie
<Vivix> Jævla onge
<Dusty> dick
<Spectrum_Rush> this guy will so be dead by the end
<Vordox> YOU TOREE THE PAPER
<Vordox> Dick
<Vivix> Annoying people in movies bug me more than in real life
<Vivix> for some reason
<MLP_Brovakiin> MrMalk: damn right!
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: you really havent met the scum of the earth then
<MrMalk> Its Hotter than Hell out there
<Vivix> Well I have, but in movies they bug me more
<SafariMonkey> Eli: Fair. I guess the fact that I also speak both fluently doesn't stop us from disagreeing. I guess everyone has different views, it would be pretty boring otherwise. And my main language is english, faroese I speak as a native, and french I also speak fluently. I also speak saafi saafi and can read danish.
<Michael> dat religion
<cowvarkian> except you wont defeat him <.<
<Vordox> Cross gives no water.
<Meanwhile> The true cross can't cure dehydration.
<MrMalk> Historically that Templar leader led them to the downfall the the Templars
<shibaru> I'm... I dunno
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: Can't cure starvation, either.
<cowvarkian> or death
<Patricia> This is really good so far.
<Meanwhile> That dude is a terrible leader.
<cowvarkian> spoiler: they lose
<Vordox> Patricia: Suprisingly better then I expected.
<Aircrafter> I remember watching this on the history channel. This is where everything goes to shit.
<Cades> oh
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> cowvarkian: :(
<cowvarkian> dude, its history
<Vivix> Mutiny plz
<Michael> meh
<mentallyeffedguy> we all gotta admit moustache man is pretty cute XD
<Eli> SafariMonkey: geez no need to show off :P i'm kidding of course, but you're right, i guess every language is diffrent to learn for everyone
<Vivix> Ii'm not into thaat kinda guy
<Vivix> s
<cowvarkian> tru fax mentallyeffedguy
<Eli> he reminds me of sam of LotR right now
<Vivix> Anr guy is cuter
<Vivix> Arn*

<Vivix> Jeg har ingen ære, min herre! Men eg følger deg likeså
<Eli> but sure i will travel with you master frodo. of course master frodo :P
<mentallyeffedguy> a guy?
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I guess in my opinion there are more exceptions in english, but the problem is that exceptions are difficult to define. :P
<Aircrafter> Its a huge cross.
<cowvarkian> yes, mentallyeffedguy
<Vordox> En nation, ej ett land, Inga gränser haver vi. :) <3 Norway for our brothers.
<Michael> huuuge cross
<Aircrafter> I wonder where they filmed this.
<cowvarkian> mars
<mentallyeffedguy> omg derpy chat
<Wrek> 05images have shown that mars doesnt have that fine sand in its deserts
<Vordox> Do not doubt god, but doubt the messengers of god
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Eli> SafariMonkey: not really: an exception is something which, while showing all signs of a rule, doesn't apply to the rule.
<cowvarkian> fine, a super planet millions of light years away
<Dusty> ugh it must be soo hot
<MLP_Brovakiin> it was filmed using curiosity on mars yesterday
<shibaru> Poofer.
<CCCP-> Bye everypony!!
<Wrek> 05i can only iamgine how hot the chainmail gets in the sun
<Aircrafter> Bye CCCP-.

<Vivix> hehe
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye CCCP-
<Vivix> I carried chainmail during a LARPA once
<Aircrafter> THE TENTS
<CCCP-> Ty Aircrafter
<Vivix> fuckheavy-
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Not only that, just the fact of walking through the desert.

<BladedWings> bye CCCP-
<CCCP-> And MLP_Brovakiin
<Obsidian> Morning Rommulus
<Michael> ohaim Rommulus
<SafariMonkey> Eli: Then the question is defining rules. How many similar examples does it take for a group of exceptions to form a new rule?
<MrMalk> bye CCCP
<Vivix> oh no, the guy did that himself cowvarkian
<CCCP-> And every one else
<potato_pony> bye CCCP-
<Eli> SafariMonkey: they might have called it another name and made it a rule in french, but it's still an exception to the original rule.
<Wrek> 05MrMalk: Arn: THe kingdom at ends road. its sthe secodn movie in a series of so far 2 movies
<Rommulus> What are we watching today?
<Vordox> Wrek: So far?
<Spectrum_Rush> ah i remember this mission from AoE also
<Wrek> 05i wouldbt be surpised if the made more
<mentallyeffedguy> "if god wills it"
<mentallyeffedguy> what?!
<Vordox> Wrek: It's like the 1970-80s Oddesey! Awesome!
<Vivix> Is Arn based on a real guy?
<Eli> SafariMonkey: take the "verbes d'hopital" for example. they form a new rule, but to me, they are an exception
<Wrek> 05Vivix: if arn is i do not know for sure, but the events that take place are
<Vivix> yeah- hm
<cowvarkian> Vivix: sure, why not
<MrMalk> Wrek its a great series Ive seen it before
<Vivix> also, damn Hydra. when mods ping me, prolly cause of colour, I don't get pinged
<Vordox> Wrek: I think I recall the book of Arn is actually an old story, but from where it came... >.>
*Vivix shakes client
<Eli> SafariMonkey: to the original rule, they are an exception* not only to me
<mentallyeffedguy> wrek: is it much left?
<Wrek> 05mentallyeffedguy: we're not even halfway muddafucka :D
<Vordox> When was the crusade?
<mentallyeffedguy> dammit!!!1
<Vordox> 1500-1600?
<Dusty> bye everypony
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I agree. I'm just too caught up with the discussion to want to stop. We are simultaneously agreeing and disagreeing, and I say you win so we don't derail this chat too far. :P

<Fl00tersh41> Vordox: The first one was 1050 or there about, if my memory serves
<mentallyeffedguy> https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GUWRP1nRO38/UEUGkDDIbwI/AAAAAAAAFDE/nvrY6uatW74/s1600/WizardRidingaUnicornonaRainbowinSpace.png everyone must watch and enjoy the awesomeness of nyan MLP!!!!!

<cowvarkian> these were in 1190 or so
<Vivix> 1280- then the viking era was ending or ended
<mentallyeffedguy> WizardRidingaUnicornonaRainbowinSpace
<MrMalk> Wrek I really enjoy historical movies

<Vivix> Yeah I like these kind of movies, I like that-- half historically correct stuff
<cowvarkian> Wrek: it would be before that
<Wrek> 05get out x3
<Aircrafter> Michael: Ditto.
<cowvarkian> because saladin died 1193
<Vordox> WHOA
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Most historians count the end of the Vikings Era at the battle of stamford bridge, days before the battle of hastings
<Vordox> 20 years...
<Wrek> 05cowvarkian: i said 1280 out of random memory
<Vivix> yeah, when was that?
<Fl00tersh41> Thats 1076 or some such
<Wrek> 05i didnt actualyl know what it said in the itnro
<SafariMonkey> Eli: I did that because some people don't stop until you admit defeat. As far as I was concerned we were just discussing different experiences and interpretations.
<Vivix> ah yeah
<cowvarkian> well, this is probably third crusade
<Vivix> 1014 I think was the battle of stiklestad, where our king died-
<Vivix> but we had tons and tons of kings
<mentallyeffedguy> ill be right back, chat is derping itself to the max
<Vivix> but he was the Christian King come to turn norway into a christian country
<Vordox> Vivix: Sorry for your loss...
<Vivix> Well, too long ago to care hehe
<Aircrafter> Christians.
<mentallyeffedguy> ok im back :)
<Vivix> I think they tortured people to turn them religious- so I'm not sure what was going on there
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Yeah, sadly nothing good lasts forever
<Eli> anyways, good night guys. i got to a test to learn for
<Rommulus> welcome back mentallyeffedguy

<Brad[Laptop]> i kind of expected it though.

<SafariMonkey> Wrek really likes that splayed leg pose that rarely appears in the show
<Vivix> And I'm back
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Welcome back! :)
<Vivix> Thank you AJIsAwesome
<JRPHONE> SuperBrony64 is a sandvich
*Bronysith puts Wrek in a full nelson
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/90756
*Everlasting_Joy wacks Bronysith "He's not Raditz."
<Vivix> Ah I love those unshorn fetloks
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ur right
*Bronysith puts Everlasting_Joy in a full nelson
<Obsidian> Need to leave for the moment. Later everypony.
<JRPHONE> Mica can you make me a sandvich
<BladedWings> bye Obsidian
<LadyCanary> :O Wreky still streaming? Daaaaaayum
*Everlasting_Joy takes Bronysith to the ground because he knows how to escape a full-nelson.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: viking pony?
<SafariMonkey> Does it happen to be the case that anyone here can recommend a fan fiction they really liked?
*Vivix doesn't know wrestling. Stays out of it
<Brad[Laptop]> SafariMonkey if it doesnt have pictures, i dont like it. my imagination is fried.
<Vivix> I mainly read shipping, maybe
<Brad[Laptop]> :P
<SafariMonkey> to be clear, I am looking for *story* fan fiction
*LadyCanary is so pleased with how Wreky's drawing is coming out ;3
<Vivix> have you read off the map and apoptosis SafariMonkey? /beware misspellings and memoryfail
<Vivix> those two are adventure and story heavy things- I really liked them
<Vivix> Some implied romance, but not a lot
<Michael> Gnight everypony HF with the art :)
<SafariMonkey> I have read Night's favoured child (so far) and about 6 others
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Michael!
*Vivix has read far too much fanfiction
<SafariMonkey> I read these over a couple days
<Vivix> Nights favoured child was pretty good
*AJIsAwesome is still trying to get into fanfics.
<Applejack2012> cya
<SafariMonkey> i've probably read about 2.5k words so far I suppose
<Dark92Invalid> So......''A Canterlot Wedding'' is getting it's encore this saturday morining!!!!!!!
<Applejack2012> yay
<Dark92Invalid> F*** TO THE YEAH!
<SafariMonkey> *250k
<magmablock> Hopefully that's an indication of season 3 coming soon
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark92Invalid: I've got it on iTunes and DVD, but yay!
<Vivix> I've read 8 million words I think
<Vivix> on the fimfictoin estimate
<Patricia> Corn on the cob, corn on the kabob!
<SafariMonkey> vivix where is that?
<Vivix> Fimfiction.net
<magmablock> The fanifics I've read all the way through could be counted on one hand. But two of them are Fallout Equestria and Project Horizons, sooo...
<Vivix> on your userprofile it says estimated words read
<shibaru> I got taco sauce on my ipod
<magmablock> ~1.5 million words there
<Vivix> also, Off the edge of the map, and Apotheosis are two of my favourite adventure/story heavy fics
<Vivix> both around 40 K so not too long
<Vivix> oh wait, Knighty removed estimate AGAIN
<BladedWings> gonna go for now guys, see ya later...thanks for the stream and HF with the art Wrek
<Vivix> Ceeya BladedWings
<AJIsAwesome> BladedWings: Bye! Your nickname is awesome! :)
<BladedWings> AJIsAwesome: thanks, again another one off the top of my head %_%
<BladedWings> *^_^
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care BladedWings!
<AJIsAwesome> BladedWings: No problem. Wish I could come up with stuff like that.
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Could I have fimficton links?
<Vivix> Wrek, are we allowed to post the links? Or should I just query them?
<SafariMonkey> magmablock: Are those good?
<magmablock> Extremely
<magmablock> Really dark though, so be warned if you're squeemish
<Brad[Laptop]> LOL after browsing derpibooru and seeing all the "questionable place holder pics", I finally figured out that there are actually pics there being hidden and not just a ton of reposts of the "questionable" pic
<Brad[Laptop]> hahaha
<Vivix> magmablock, Oh I love FoE- but haven't read project horizon yet. You kinda have to enjoy that fallout style to love those stories
<Vivix> but I aboslutely love them- currently reading FoE: Hero by No one
<VikingCanary> Love this one <3
<Bronysith> VikingCanary: oh hey, you are viking now
<magmablock> I've been meaning to check that one out. What can you tell me about it?
<Vivix> Oh Brad[Laptop] hehe
<Applejack2012> cya
<Sumica> 00,10Canary <3
<Brad[Laptop]> Vivix another funny thing is i kind of like the placeholder pic hahaha
<Vivix> magmablock, I think it works really well so far, don't feel like it breaks the fanon, and I really like the moral greyness of it- I like the main character, she's very different from the others I read
<Vivix> It's also like..as I told the author in my fanboygasm, the first chapter gets sadder and sadder the more I read
<princess> sorry i derped out >.>
<magmablock> Neat, I'll be sure to give it a gander
<Vivix> I think next of hte FoE for me is Project Horizon, or New Beginnings (I want to try it- despite it kinda spooking me)
<Wrek> 05Great strength is the one who shows mercy
<Wrek> 05if you wonder about the boot rune
<Wrek> 05s
<Vivix> It's a great read, good pacing so far and such. It's more of the NV style, but not really latching onto any of the story from the games
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: True words, true words.
<VikingCanary> ....That's awesome Wrek.
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: go for horizons, i love it
<magmablock> PH has a few pacing issues, sometimes it takes forever to get anywhere and other times a huge revelation is explained in like 3 sentences, but when it gets going, it's hard to put down.
<magmablock> It also somehow manages to be even darker than the original
<Vivix> Ooh? Neat- what's the main char like?
<Wrek> 05atleast as clsoe as i can get off my memory
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, I think I will- it's finished right?
<Dark_Horst> PH also seem to have the problem that its auhor canz decide on an endin^^
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: nope
<Vivix> Ooh
<Dark_Horst> waiting for chapter 50 atm
<Vivix> how many words? I think I heard 800K
<Dark_Horst> but i think its somewhere in the last third
<magmablock> She's a lazy Stable security officer who gets swepped up in the action outside when her Stable gets an unfriendly visitor. She can get a little angsty sometimes, but other times she's one of the most fun characters I've ever read.
<Vivix> ah akai
<BladedWings> well, looks like i get to stay a little longer ^_^
<magmablock> Especially when she gets drunk
<Vivix> Hehe
<Everlasting_Joy> BladedWings: :).
<Ponies47> BladedWings: Yay! :D
<Vivix> FoE is one of the few fic universes where I like drunkenness
<Vivix> it fits the mood-
<Cades> fail
<Dark_Horst> she also seems to catch every shit that gets tjrown around somewhere in the hoofington wasteland
<SafariMonkey> magmablock: what am I missing, I only see about 0.5k from what you said, not 1.5k
<SafariMonkey> magmablock: or typo?
<magmablock> Must be
<BladedWings> Vivix: FoE?
<Vivix> hehe, hmm sounds like a good read- what about eh-- any romance?
<Vivix> Fallout Equestria
<Sumica> 00,10soooooooo, where do pony vikeings get leather?
<BladedWings> oh thought so :$
<Bronysith> Sumica: your shins
<Vivix> from their foes Sumica
<VikingCanary> .....Oh my o3o
<Sumica> 00,10next we need pony in glass armor
<magmablock> There's a bit of romance, but it tends to take a back seat
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as this one seems to be in banded
<Vivix> Well, sounds like a good mix- I think it'll be the next I read after No One's
<SafariMonkey> I don'tmind romance, but I don't want it to be the main focus. NO PWP
<Vivix> probably read pink eyes between them, as it's a bit shorter. Also been meaing to check out some new ones, but I'm scared of going into one that breaks the universe canon and mucks about in 'OC' land-
<Vivix> I adooore romance, but in a fic like FoE it's kinda best as motivation or..backseat
<DalemixFawte> Greetings!
<Dark_Horst> silly Sumica, that's obviously guard armor
<Vivix> Greetings!
<pony_9567> I came here after seeing the royal wedding encore thing on EqD. Am i right in hoping it will be on here?
<Applejack2012> I love to write romane fics on fimfiction
<Vivix> Stormcloak guard armor
<magmablock> Just be warned. If you thought the original was dark, PH is pitch black at times. Just wait until you get to chapter 22
<magmablock> Bam
<Vivix> 22, a recurring number
<AJIsAwesome> DalemixFawte: Hello! :)
<Vivix> and yeah I like dark when dark is done well
<Vivix> Like Little Pip's drug addiction, and the end- I really liked
<shibaru> I hape Mike is having a good sap 8)
<magmablock> Same here. Most of the fics I read of dark. I just really like dark stories in general
<SafariMonkey> basically I am absolutely fine with romance, but I hate the ones that think that PWP is ok
<AJIsAwesome> pony_9567: Try asking the mods. Maybe they'll help you.
<Dark_Horst> sooooo, just finished installing the first deus ex on windows 7 and going to try it out. wish me luck
<DalemixFawte> Yes, yes.. Hello.
<Sumica> 00,10So jelly, just saw some one get a gold bot killer wrench a bit ago
<DalemixFawte> What's up¿
<SafariMonkey> and romance-containing ones?
<Vivix> I tend to avoid dark tag because of the whole.."i'ma top cupcakes" trend, but good dark is amazing- I love it
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: PWP?
<magmablock> Damn straight
<Applejack2012> I write some dark fics too
<magmablock> Like you said, the story arc with Pip's addiction. That had me glued to the screen
<Applejack2012> but not cupcake
<Vivix> Yeah what is PWP? and Applejack2012 what you write?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Do you know if the Canterlot Wedding encore will be aired here?
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PWP first entry.
<Vivix> Yeah the addiction was done so well, I loved it. I just--it camse so slowly that I almost didn't notice it- and then it just dawned on me that she--was so heavily in to it that she didn't either
<Sumica> 00,10this saterday, yeah
<pony_9567> YAY
<Ponies47> Canterlot Wedding encore?
<Applejack2012> I write romance, adventure and dark Vivix
<Sumica> 00,10mind you they have reaired it like 3 times already
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Okay.
<Vivix> What's your fimfict username?
<pony_9567> I joined the herd the day after it aired. So i haven't had a chance to watch a single episode live yet. lol
<Dark_Horst> if you want plot in your clop, try romance reports. it does incredibly well on the story.side
<Sumica> 00,10but my guess is this one, because they are advertiseing it and such will have the anouncment ad for when s3 starts
<SafariMonkey> Most of those never become very popular anyway
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, totally
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Same
<magmablock> That's actually pretty realistic. Most addicts don't realize they have a problem until they find out they've been going through 4 packs a day
<Dark_Horst> i can truly and honestly say i read romance reports for the plot. ACTUAL plot
<Sumica> 00,10You sould join us friday for movie night pony_9567
<AJIsAwesome> pony_9567: Welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules here and I'm sure you'll have a great time here! :)
<Sumica> 00,10and if you stick around pick a name so every one can get to know you
<AJIsAwesome> pony_9567: http://derpiboo.ru/2604

<Cades> lol alright
<prince-dari> Well, we left our previous lesson, then just kind of stopped walking to the next lesson, there was a cricket match going on, and we just sort of stopped, and started watching that. No one said "let's skip the lesson", but we all just ended up stopping. One guy went down to the classroom to get his phone (which had been confiscated), then came back again.
<Cynder7> 6Woo! It works! ^^
<Spectrum_Rush> .
<prince-dari> And no one noticed our whole class standing there for about 50 minutes.

<Cynder7> 6xD
<Freefall29> derpherp: back in those days, you needed armor for everything
