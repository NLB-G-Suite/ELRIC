<Deadlypon3> I don't know about you, but a wheel of spinning turbines and fuelage isn't that good for heading up into space...
<Yahooz> worth a try
<Dken2021> Saturn adorable
<otakon> Sumica: TRY THAT!
<Rain> YES!
<hen3ry> of course into the wind means now jets spin round and roun
<sonicrainboomer259> is dungeon & dragons online fun?cause i'm getting it on steam

<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, try it
<Phase4> 00,02wings will do something
<otakon> Sumica: CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF SOME OF THE THRUSTERS!
<Magic> rotate the boosters
<Polydunami> It's cuter than Shoggoth, Saturn :S
<otakon> Sumica: make HALF go up the other half go side to side
<Dken2021> can't you change the direction of the jets?
<Yahooz> More thrusters. Always a good idea
<otakon> hiya Dken2021 how are ya?
<hen3ry> ok. So now jet engine expels hot gas directly into intake of next jet engine, and so on and so on...

<MahBoi777> OneTrickPony: exactly!
<otakon> Sumica: okay, so next time HALF as many thrusters and fuel tanks
<SolairePony89> Turn off ALL the particle effects
<Tovler> otakon: no, the ending did.
<McScootaloo> rule of thumb - if your rocket is taller than the launch tower, it will lag to death
<otakon> Tovler: okay I missed it so NOW I have to see it
<noname> otakon: lets double the fun, and add more boosters :D
<otakon> noname: it'll lag out again
<otakon> Sumica: HALF THAT AMOUNT!
<AttackWithHugs> oh god it saved

<McScootaloo> crashing the game is depressingly easy. It's too easy to build a rocket that the game cannot handle (not that it's easy to build either once rockets get big)

<Om> Is it bad when you start to fall asleep standing up?
<sagas[A]> boom?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> anyone else here flown a plane?
<hen3ry> Why do all big machines have such large and easy to use self destruct buttons?
<MahBoi777> Om: nah, it's perfectly natural
<SolairePony89> Om:
<GrimGallop> It didn't blow up in the way you were hoping to blow it up.
<mitamaking> Om: I don't think that is possible?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so much lags
<Polydunami> I flew one, Big_Macintosh_1992. It was made out of paper :3
<SolairePony89> Om: Yeah, IMPOSSIBRU
<Om> I sure hope it is.
<Rain> I know why it turns like that
<GrimGallop> Or so I'm assuming, since you seemed surprised that dropping your engine made you explode.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> haha Polydunami i suppose that counts lol
<hen3ry> not impossibru. Just very brief.
<mitamaking> Oh, it exploded, good to know
<noname> lol
<hen3ry> fall asleep standing up, start falling, instantly wake up
<Rain> the physics cant handle the rotation of the Kearth
<Magic> you got air
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<mitamaking> pop in texture
<GrimGallop> That thing should be able to burrow underground.
<hen3ry> but since sleepwalking is possible, sleepstanding logically should be as well
<Polydunami> But are you talking about actually having piloted an airplane?
<MahBoi777> Om: sleepwalking time is all
<Om> MahBoi777: I haven't done that in a while.
<CECtheRonin> Hey everypony.

<Om> MahBoi777: This walk is what all true wariors strive for
<Rain> try throttling down before detach

<doughnutjoe> hi
<noname> cow334: what are you talking about, valve can't count to 3

<cow334> noname: Then how is there a level THREE sentrie in tf2
<cow334> DERP
<TheRareP0N3> ew

<cow334> noname: seems legit
<cow334> I am looks forward to deadspace three
<cow334> that is gonna be good
<scottish-geeky> KiwiBoi777: hail the gods of metal
<KiwiBoi777> indeed lol
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, yeah, thats why i'm not sure they'll make a tf3, tf2 is hyper polished and they are incrimentaly improving it
<noname> why do i keep find pocket in tf2? i have 12 already and its getting annoying
<FairysHuff> *Settles in for a long cuddle session with the chat* ~_~ *Snuggles up*
<doughnutjoe> cow334 there is gonna be a meet the pyro
<noname> finding*
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Hows yee?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm ok
<cow334> Phase4: yeah well then hmm I dont think we will see a tf3 for a while then are we probaly wont see it at all eh well i am happy with tf2
<Phase4> 00,02i would like to see the game tf2 was originaly envisioned to be
<cow334> doughnutjoe: i thought there was already one?
<FairysHuff> Phase4: which was?
<Phase4> 00,02a 'fps rts' mashup
<noname> pfft
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Theres already games like that now.
<scottish-geeky> chat deruped
<cow334> Phase4: yup well I'm guess ing when they actually finiseh tf2 it will cost money to have it or they will just give it to us for free like nice people ..... i dunno
<Phase4> 00,02would be very hard to pull off though, which is probably be why valve abandoned it
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, multiplayer
<Phase4> 00,02there would be 'commanders' playing the rts part
<Phase4> 00,02and players playing the fps part, ordered around by the commanders
<Phase4> 00,02or something like that
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah, its easy for that to fall apart
<scottish-geeky> hail the gardin of metal hail the gods of metaL
<doughnutjoe> cow334 nope
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Ah... Sounds like it will rely a lot on the commanders. And you know some people will screw it up

<RoboGerbil> Phase4: you can just sneak i without killing them
<FairysHuff> cow334: It's a self aware computer system with lasers
<Phase4> 00,02i thought of that
<Phase4> 00,02but then i screwed up
<cow334> FairysHuff: wow cool
<Rain> y u no save and load?
<FairysHuff> cow334: How old are you?

<Phase4> 00,02i'm not doing so well
<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Night
<sub06905> night Ponies47
<cow224> night Ponies47 may lunas stars bless your sleep
<RoboGerbil> do you have any points left to level with? can you afford the invisible ability?
<Rain> Phase4, wait for them to move
<flutterchu> Phase4: you need to see where they are looking if one is facing the box youre going kill him first
<FairysHuff> Phase4: You already made a kill earlier in the game. You may as well just use lethal force now. You won't get the pacifist achievement
<Phase4> 00,02not looking for achivment
<FairysHuff> Phase4: fair enough
<RoboGerbil> he gets more xp for not killing
<cow224> well if you get more xp for not killing then try not to kill
<Gunny> I can't sleep, guys :<
<cow224> Gunny: then dont go to sleep it is evil
<Ghosties> 04What he needs is the invisible boat mobile
<cow224> lawl
<Gunny> :<
<FairysHuff> Gunny: Do what I do. Put some low volume music on, instrumental, no vocals. It helps
<Iron_Edge> Gunny: -lol try thinking of something really trivial.
<RoboGerbil> im guessing he doesnt have the super strength to move large boxes either
<Iron_Edge> Gunny: Like a paradox
<Gunny> Iron_Edge, that will just make it worse xD
<cow224> Gunny: Want me to give you a link of a real peacefull pony song that will make you go to sleep?
<Ponies47> annnd
<Ponies47> HE'S GONE!
<Iron_Edge> Gunny: Like answer this question: How do you throw away the worlds largest trash can?
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<Phase4> 00,02stun gun doesnt work
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Justaxes> dont even try to attack them, just dodge them
<Justaxes> evade them
<Gunny> Iron_Edge, I just don't even
<RoboGerbil> yeh they have body armor on
<Iron_Edge> Gunny: Or how do you know when to go at a stop sign, without a go sign?
<Midnight_Tempest> stun gun works Phase4... you just have to get them from behind for it to work best
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Use the PEPS?
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: saw your latest drawing its god damn good :)
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, dont have it
<Midnight_Tempest> also... blind firing the stun gun is never a good idea Phase4...
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Awwww. ~_~
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, it works well if they are right around the corner
<cow224> Assanate him
<Iron_Edge> Gunny: -lol paradoxes, just think about it long enough and you'l be out like a light in no time :3
<Justaxes> the best encounter is an avoided encounter
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: -lol Sweetie belle?
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: true, but just wait for him to turn around... you'll get him guaranteed and aim it...
<Gunny> FairysHuff, have you heard PinkiePieSwear's Hush Now Quiet Now [Lucid Dream Mix]
<FairysHuff> Gunny: No.
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: yeah it's really well shades and what not :P
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: shaded*
<Gunny> FairysHuff, it's epic
<FairysHuff> Gunny: I listen to a new age internet radio channel while sleeping. It helps me sleep.
<RoboGerbil> wow i have a near 2 min lag on the stream to chat
<cow224> my stream is lagging
<FairysHuff> RoboGerbil: Same
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: -lol thanks.
<killerpony7733> Dat long delay
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: np :)
<XAX> Guys. If guns don't kill people, people kill people. Does that mean that toasters don't toast toast, toast toasts toast?
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<FairysHuff> XAX: Yes.
<Chrysalis> yes
<cow224> XAX: wow
<RoboGerbil> guns dont kill people... bullets do
<Iron_Edge> XAX: Of course :3
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<cow224> dem toast
<Midnight_Tempest> told you it would work Phase4...
<Midnight_Tempest> dat emp nade
<RoboGerbil> think when i did this part i shot 1 dude in the corner then snuck around the trucks
<cow224> He just got emped
<FairysHuff> Its a flash bang
<cow224> danm
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys i'll see you later ok im off to bed talk to you guys later peace
<cow224> oh well to me it look like a empe
<cow224> emp
<cow224> night xxMoopyxx
<xxMoopyxx> Night
<sub06905> night xxMoopyxx
<FairysHuff> xxMoopyxx: night
<Midnight_Tempest> it was an emp... it causes a flashbang effect
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has left the chat*
<Phase4> 00,02you'll see in a sec where the blind fire works
<FairysHuff> Midnight_Tempest: Been a long time since I last played so probably right
<Midnight_Tempest> theres only 3 nades in the game, emp, gas and frag...
<Midnight_Tempest> also... im way too good at this game, i can get through most of it without killing anyone or triggering alarms...
<cow224> like a faust
<XAX> Phase4: What'cha playin?
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, i know it works Phase4... but they have to be like 3 feet from you... and sometimes, your already dead at that point
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, dx:hr
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> XAX Deus Ex: Human Revulution
<XAX> ah.
<FairysHuff> Well that was ... uncomfortable... ~_~
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, not if you lure them :P
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> revulution lol
<FairysHuff> Just got a call from the DWP about aranging a visit by a support officer.
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: i dont lure, i watch and wait... learning their patrol patterns... then i strike like a demon from the shadows
<cow224> lawl
<Phase4> 00,02but that takes too much time
<Phase4> 00,02and lureing is mroe fun
<cow224> i pick up a gun adn just run throught them
<cow224> and
<Midnight_Tempest> the game is about stealth and patience, though luring is a good idea in some situations
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I like setting stun traps that go off when they pass by.
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, you must teach me that
*Rain is sad that she wasnt around to say goodnight to Shizuschlafen..
*Phase4 00,02hugs Rain
<sub06905> well im off, night everypony :)
<cow224> night sub06905
*Rain hugs Phase4
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Save all the grenades you pick up. Later you get a "Trap base" item. You combine with grenades to make traps.
<cow224> may lunas stars help you sleep
<Midnight_Tempest> well, this makes me wanna play DXHR now...
<RoboGerbil> Phase4: it doesnt matter where you stop the cameras, if theyre red they dont alert
<Phase4> 00,02RoboGerbil, oh cool
<FairysHuff> Phase4: One thing about traps. ALWAYS walk slowly and crouch when trying to disarm them or they will go off in your face
<cow224> lawl
<Midnight_Tempest> DX1 traps were the most annoying to try and disarm...
<FairysHuff> Midnight_Tempest: I liked them for exactly that reason
<FairysHuff> Midnight_Tempest: I used gas traps alot in that
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, it was fun setting up a gas nade and taking down 3 or more guys... or a couple frag nades to destroy a mech
<flutterchu> dont buffer please dont buffer
<FairysHuff> I never used the frags. Made too much noise.
<Midnight_Tempest> all the buffer
<Midnight_Tempest> frag was when i was seen, emp was for silent mech kills
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<RoboGerbil> Midnight_Tempest: lol i never messed with the mechs
<Midnight_Tempest> i loved taking on the mechs, especially when i knew i would win
<FairysHuff> I always reprogrammed the mechs to attack enemies
<Midnight_Tempest> eyup
<Midnight_Tempest> that was always fun too
<RoboGerbil> mechs were easy enough to sneak around
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... i still need to finish the DLC for this game...
<cow224> I need to get into duess ex from what y'll are saying it sounds like a cool game
<FairysHuff> I got bored. FInished the main game but not teh DLC. The first Deus Ex was better.
<cow224> is it fun?
<Midnight_Tempest> deus ex was amazing, invisible war was good but i still havent finished it and DXHR was pretty damn good too, except the boss fights... kinda ruined the mood of the game...
<FairysHuff> cow224: Very. Much harder. Though old so don't expect top notch graphics
<RoboGerbil> bosses were kinda rough, especially on higher difficulties
<cow224> FairysHuff: okay and don't worry i dont look into graphics when i play games
<Midnight_Tempest> the bosses were a bad addition to the game...
<Phase4> 00,02i have 2 points
<cow224> Phase4: is that a good thing?
<Phase4> 00,02praxis points
<Midnight_Tempest> ah
<cow224> dunno what those are?
<Midnight_Tempest> try to get the icarus system Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, i was thinking that
<Phase4> 00,02i'll get the icarus
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: it is crazy useful for the whole game
<FairysHuff> Lets him upgrade his cyborg implants
<RoboGerbil> Phase4: get the one that lets you go invisible adn the one that lets you move large objects
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: eh if you like jumping yes
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: and not dieing from falling off of tall places
<Phase4> 00,02i can move large objects
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: just need to be careful you save yourself some praxis kits on that
<Phase4> 00,02invisible one is on the list
<FairysHuff> Icarus is very useful for tactics as well. Get to a roof, drop behind guards on ground, double take down.
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: i saved enough points in the game to have just about all the upgrades... its not hard
<[iPad]JRP2234> Moo
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: true but i can manage without
<RoboGerbil> yeh but take downs are killing moves hes going for non lethal
<Midnight_Tempest> takedowns can be non lethal too
<FairysHuff> RoboGerbil: Theres non-lethal takedowns as well.
<RoboGerbil> hmm
<FairysHuff> RoboGerbil: Your taught them in the tutorial
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: one tab non lethal hold tab lethal
<killerpony7733> :D
<Phase4> 00,02wanted to try the stun thing
<Phase4> 00,02it broke
<FairysHuff> Hold Q for lethal takedown, tap Q for no-lethal takedown
<RoboGerbil> lol when i played i went all lethal, was way easier
<FairysHuff> Thats why I go non-lethal. The challenge. I hate easy games
<Midnight_Tempest> of course its easier... thats why there is an achievement for doing it without killing people, except bosses
<FairysHuff> Always play on hardest setting
<killerpony7733> Woah the delay is strong within this one
<RoboGerbil> i should really play this again.. and go for those achievements
<Midnight_Tempest> oh yeah... the stream is way behind
<FairysHuff> RoboGerbil: Play the original. It's better
<RoboGerbil> FairysHuff: i dont have the first one adn i missed the sale lol
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: yep executed game by the century
<flutterchu> beta ponies sorry Phase4 but i need to send this link http://lunachan.net/pony/src/13382025982.jpg
<Midnight_Tempest> RoboGerbil: pirate bay to the rescue!
<Phase4> 00,02dat table
<Phase4> 00,02flutterchu, image links are fine
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: no......not pirate bay you don't pirate such a good game
<RoboGerbil> rather buy older games cuz its easier to get them running on newer os's than pirated stuff
<flutterchu> Phase4: oh thank goodness
<FairysHuff> RoboGerbil: Try GOG.com
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: bah, if people cant buy it or wont buy it... just download it, there isnt anything wrong with it...
<xmasskills> ded chat is ded
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: if they really shit in the poor line sure, but i honestly believe in paying for my games tbh
<BronyForLife> huh
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: Really are in*
<BronyForLife> KIL KIL KIL
<pony_247> THAT AIMING:P
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: i do too, but only for games that are worth it... most games these days arent worth it so... pirated
<BronyForLife> DUN DUN DUUUUNN
<cow224> The ponys have upgraded through time
<Midnight_Tempest> but i have the first DX on disc anyway so it doesnt matter to me
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: point taken but DX1 for one is a buy not pirate in my book
<BronyForLife> but ya failed
<cow224> They have updraded there lookd
<cow224> looks
<RoboGerbil> hmm is it me or does the lauren fause firefly look better than the rainbow dash?
<derpy_pony> hi bronies! :)
<BronyForLife> kidding right
<BronyForLife> hey
<FairysHuff> http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/deus_ex
<cow224> hello derpy_pony how are you
<BronyForLife> crotchshot?
<Midnight_Tempest> the thing that disappointed me alot about this game was there wasn't a big tie in to the first DX... other than Bob Page and when you save Tracer Tong...
<FairysHuff> Midnight_Tempest: Well it IS a pre-quel
<BronyForLife> oO
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: uh theres a few subtle hints to some things but what bugged me the most was the god damn endings,
<Phase4> 00,02this might cause stream buffers
<Phase4> 00,02tell me if you notice any
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: you can choose endings in a prequel? that isn't how they work
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: The endings could have been better but I liked Jensens monologue over them at the end
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i've seen a lets play that includes the ending
<Phase4> 00,02the ending doesnt realy work
<FairysHuff> The monologues do.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: well done for endings but it can't fit with the fact its a prequel
<derpy_pony> good good, cow224. just had to do 4 hours of psychological tests. I'm curios how they will react when it turns out my mathematical talent goes off their scale. in the worst case they will compare me with sheldon from now on. :P
<derpy_pony> and you?
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: yeah, but in the end the event of DX arent changed in anyway... this game doesnt even talk about the NSF at all, or it does but in a newspaper and briefly
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: cause in the end this and this happen that causes this later on, not hey you choose this and thats how the world will look like later
<BronyForLife> sheldon cooper ftw
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: *Shrugs* It's a game. We have that leeway.
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: Yeah true but it just felt stupid to add endings to a prequel
<derpy_pony> these guys play HALO
<cow224> derpy_pony: well don't worry that is a really good thing dont listen to what any body says but even tho wow that is amazing keep it up
<Phase4> 00,02dis is the boss fight isnt it
<Midnight_Tempest> killerpony7733: but people would have complained if there wasnt choices... saying it wasnt the same as the other games that gave you ending choices
<RoboGerbil> cant see were 2 mins behind on vid
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: sure i just don't get the thinking when they knew about its a prequel and it can only have one action that leads to DX1
<BronyForLife> 2 min.?
<FairysHuff> Midnight_Tempest: I know I would have complained.
<derpy_pony> a good mental arithmetic skill is not something I could turn into money...so it's more or less worthlless
<killerpony7733> Midnight_Tempest: May have been a bit off for the series but i would be okay with it due to the fact its a prequel
<FairysHuff> derpy_pony: Theres more to life than money
<derpy_pony> not for me...the rest is out of limits
<FairysHuff> thats sad but to each their own
<derpy_pony> I'm as social as a brick
<Midnight_Tempest> yet your here derpy_pony... this is still socializing...
<BronyForLife> So fun to livestream.. Noone is actually watching..
<FairysHuff> derpy_pony: I mean self-fulfilment. Something your interested in that would use your talent for math.
<FairysHuff> derpy_pony: Astro-physics is my interest
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: i am i have both my eyes on chat and the stream
<BronyForLife> uhm
<FairysHuff> As have I
<derpy_pony> hm...sounds good
<BronyForLife> Do you have 4 eyes?
<BronyForLife> AH GAWDAMN I REALLY NEED ADBLOCK
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: nope just a very large eye sight tbh
<FairysHuff> I have eyes on my chin
<BronyForLife> Aright
<FairysHuff> Its hell to chave
<cow224> Lawl four eyes but
<cow224> ...
<BronyForLife> Seems healthy
<FairysHuff> *shave
<cow224> (__)~(__) it can happen
<BronyForLife> PLAY TF2!
<FairysHuff> BronyForLife: No
<BronyForLife> why nooooot
<Midnight_Tempest> cause he's playing DXHR
<BronyForLife> sooo whaaaat
<Midnight_Tempest> the stream is just lagging bad
<BronyForLife> now he's not..
<cow224> YAAY DXHR TIME
<FairysHuff> BronyForLife: Cause their ALWAYS playing TF2. I'd like to see something different
<BronyForLife> he has alot of games..
<FairysHuff> I have over 200 I think
<killerpony7733> I have almost 100 games on steam
<FairysHuff> All on steam. Not counting boxed games
<BronyForLife> i have alot of free games
<BronyForLife> -_-
<killerpony7733> Dat super delay
<FairysHuff> http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/deus_ex
<BronyForLife> lol
<BronyForLife> dat chat is from 5 min. ago or something
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: you might wanna restart the stream... the lag is at least 5-10 minutes behind
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: yep extremely huge delay is huge
<FairysHuff> Much like my... eh... nevermind
<Phase4> 00,02tell me if it starts to buffer
<FairysHuff> It's been buffering on and off for ages for me
<Midnight_Tempest> there we go
<derpy_pony> looks like we have two A movies this week
<BronyForLife> Yay
<Midnight_Tempest> its all synced now
<DeadpoolDash> it caught up now
<BronyForLife> We are LIVE WOAOAHAOHHFDA
<Kammerjunk> Paul is dead.
<FairysHuff> Woot
<Midnight_Tempest> BronyForLife: calm down... its too late to be acting like that
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: say what? :O
<BronyForLife> :(
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Turn me on, dead man.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: DX1 parody? :D
<BronyForLife> proof: Deus is modern
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: No, just an old Beatles rumour.
<FairysHuff> I want to see Phase4 get pulverised during the boss battle repeatedly ^_^ But I'm tired. Going to nap for a bit.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: oh lol 6_9
<Kammerjunk> I decided to play Notpron.
<Phase4> 00,02night FairysHuff
<Kammerjunk> It's fun.
<Phase4> 00,02i might stop before the bos
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Laters
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I hope so ^_^ I want to see that
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: fun fact you can win one of the boss fights with only gas canisters and explosive ones
<BronyForLife> stream is getting behind again
<flutterchu> die
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: uh thats standard lag for Phase4
<BronyForLife> standard lag..
<Phase4> 00,02is it buffering?
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: he lives in australia thus delay
<Texasboykc09> on and off
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in aus so its probably causeing problems with mips
<BronyForLife> Ah austrelia
<cow224> Phase4: no it show the stream for me but i dont knoe if i am late in it
<cow224> ?
<Phase4> 00,02G'day mate
<flutterchu> why are you BUFFERING
<Phase4> 00,02trying to clear the lag
<BronyForLife> 'Cause he lives in Auestrelia
<Phase4> 00,02should be ~20 s now
<BronyForLife> Austrelia
<cow224> Phase4: works better for me now
<Midnight_Tempest> why are you complaining about the buffering? it wont make it better people...
<BronyForLife> It's somewhat a reflex..
<BronyForLife> Like with a phone
<BronyForLife> IF someone doesnt hear you you yell, even though technology makes it sound at the same volume
<flutterchu> ill be leaving now ill come back late- wait i can poput the chat
<dishwasher_EXTREME> mooooo
<BronyForLife> uh-oh
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i am back!!
<Kammerjunk> Dat laughter.
<BronyForLife> boom
<BronyForLife> OH CMON
<Phase4> 00,02i do not have enough ammo to do this without deaths
<Kammerjunk> Non-lethal playthrough?
<cow224> Phase4: DIE WITH STYLE
<Midnight_Tempest> sneak past them Phase4...
<BronyForLife> no
<BronyForLife> ITS FAIL WITH STYLE
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, cant now
<Midnight_Tempest> shame...
<RoboGerbil> Phase4: yeh thats the problem with non lethal, only 2 guns
<Midnight_Tempest> 2 guns but you supplement them with skills, like the cloak
<Phase4> 00,02i might be able to from an earlier save
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i has no cloak
<Midnight_Tempest> silly
<Midnight_Tempest> the cloak is very, very usefull
<BronyForLife> and there goes the alarm
<ThunderCloud> Hello everypony :)
<BronyForLife> Hello
<BronyForLife> Everypony is so active in the chat..
<cow224> well the chat is kinda going
<cow224> SLoooooooooooow
<BronyForLife> Thats with these stealth games..
<BronyForLife> nice shot
<Chrysalis> hmm, has phase hit the upgrade point yet?
<Midnight_Tempest> stealth games are best games...
<BronyForLife> Im more for the assault
<BronyForLife> Or whatever sniping is
<Midnight_Tempest> then you would die in this game over and over
<BronyForLife> In this game yes
<Midnight_Tempest> there is more to gaming than everything being a CoD clone...
<cow224> (L^-^)L waaaoooww so so eeettttiiiiaaannncccceeee dddouuubbllee rraaiinnbboowwwsss
<MadSurge> ^
<BronyForLife> But CoD sux
<Chrysalis> Midnight_Tempest thankfully, CoD is a terrible game
<cow224> cod was okay
<BronyForLife> Only decent FPS are Bf and Tf2
<cow224> until mw2 and so one came
<Chrysalis> emphasis on the 'Was' there Cow
<Midnight_Tempest> yet every game is pretty much the same as CoD...
<BronyForLife> Bf is realistic
<BronyForLife> ..-ish
<Midnight_Tempest> BF is boring
<cow224> Chrysalis: k
<cow224> bf is boring as well
<flutterchu> gee I thought i was the only one who hated call of duty
<BronyForLife> Imo deus is boring
<Chrysalis> its just alot more tactical than other shooters
<Midnight_Tempest> TF2 is the only fun generic shooter out there
<MadSurge> BronyForLife: hey hey, don't forget Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Serious Sam
<BronyForLife> Uhm yeah..
<cow224> like i said cod was okay until they keeped on going
<Chrysalis> Midnight_Tempest you mean only fun hat simulator
<BronyForLife> HEY
<cow224> they should have stoped at mw1
<ThunderCloud> before we go all CoD on BF, anypony want to try out pegadrome with me? came out today :3 http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555
<Midnight_Tempest> BronyForLife: deus ex isnt a game for people that have no patience...
<BronyForLife> Tf2 is guddd
<Chrysalis> MadSurge serious sam is doing a very nice job in the latest set
<BronyForLife> All games that valve made are good
<Midnight_Tempest> Chrysalis: ah yes... right... hat simulator
<Chrysalis> keepin old style shootin with newer graphics
<cow224> ThunderCloud: i was lookiing at that want to play it?
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: :)
<ThunderCloud> cow224 Eeyup :D
<cow224> ThunderCloud: okay well send me the thing to play then
<BronyForLife> But you have to admit
<BronyForLife> In deus there is much less action
<cow224> Halo is awesome
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, but i love that about the game
<BronyForLife> Ok
<Midnight_Tempest> you have to think in deus ex
<BronyForLife> and you hate action pacted games
<Midnight_Tempest> CoD and BF you just run and gun...
<Chrysalis> I loved halo 1 and 3, but im severely dissapointed in 2 and 4
<BronyForLife> thats what i like
<DeadpoolDash> you can run and gun deus ex, just a differebt sort of playstyle
<BronyForLife> so just different opinions..
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont hate action games, they just get repeatative
<RawketLawnchair> What's with the OC desktop pone?
<flutterchu> Chrysalis: what's the ending of halo 2
<Midnight_Tempest> thats phase4's OC
<cow224> Call of duty: Where the snipers run around and the guys with the machine guns camp
<cow224> LAWL
<BronyForLife> logics
<BronyForLife> thats why i hate it
<Chrysalis> cow224 and neither can shoot
<BronyForLife> and love tf2 :D
<cow224> Chrysalis: yup
<Chrysalis> theres so much spray in that game you never get good, yuou just get lucky
<Midnight_Tempest> whatever... TF2 is ok, but it isnt that great...
<BronyForLife> Because theres no stealth..
<MadSurge> cow224: and a knife to the foot is instant death :D
<BronyForLife> Well perhaps spy..
<cow224> MadSurge: haha yup
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, but the spy sucks
<BronyForLife> DUN DUN DUUUUNN
*DeadpoolDash hates spies...
<Midnight_Tempest> im more of a scout player
<Chrysalis> i hate scouts more than any other class
<RawketLawnchair> My vision is augmented.
<BronyForLife> Im scout,spy,sniper
<cow224> Battlefield: Where you can get in a plan faster then rainbowdash and jump out like there is nothing
<BronyForLife> so pretty much everything with an s
<cow224> lawl
<Chrysalis> there friggen drinks are OP
<MadSurge> Midnight_Tempest: then play scout, noone is good with all characters :D
<BronyForLife> especially with pyro..
<flutterchu> anyone want to play http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555 my ID is f8042e04e629f4a6dc0727db8d00bb5b5ac0582328506cf053c164fcaaff55c4
<Phase4> 00,02GODDAMNITSTUNGUN
<BronyForLife> heey pegadrome
<BronyForLife> is that the song?
<Midnight_Tempest> and honestly BronyForLife i just hate current gen shooters... it doesnt matter if they are like deus ex, or doom, or quake... if the shooter is the same as every other game in its series, its going to get boring and sucky
<Midnight_Tempest> this is why i dont play CoD, or any BF games
<BronyForLife> All games suck after time
<BronyForLife> I mean Bf3 sucked
<BronyForLife> Everything from WaW sucked
<DeadpoolDash> BF1942 is still the bestest
<BronyForLife> Thats going to happen with everything
<Midnight_Tempest> and halo... well... halo ended for me at halo reach, the game is gonna go to shit with halo 4
<BronyForLife> serious?
<BronyForLife> perhaps a reason why valve never makes a third game
<Chrysalis> Midnight_Tempest know that feel, i was excited for 4 up until they actually released footage for it
<cow224> Halo: Takes skill to actually get a kill and there is know lame perks or killstreaks
<cow224> Simple as that
<cow224> lawl
<BronyForLife> Tf2 needs team
<Chrysalis> cow +1 to that, killstreaks and perks are terrible
<BronyForLife> And THATS what i love in games
<Chrysalis> although, deathstreams are worse
<Midnight_Tempest> Chrysalis: i never saw anything on it... just some comments from Yahtzee and masterchief wearing a new hat or something
<Chrysalis> i really fucking hate deathstreams
<cow224> Chrysalis: I know right
<flutterchu> anyone want to play pegodrum my ID is f8042e04e629f4a6dc0727db8d00bb5b5ac0582328506cf053c164fcaaff55c4 here's the link http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555
<Chrysalis> what kind of shooter thinks its a good idea to REWARD someone for being shite at a game
<Chrysalis> if you suck you should lose, dont try to boost weak players all the god damn time
<Midnight_Tempest> never gonna happen
<BronyForLife> Why
<BronyForLife> Others need to learn to y'know
<Chrysalis> BronyForLife learn by getting better at the game, not by getting an advantage
<BronyForLife> Im not saying i boost them
<Chrysalis> worst offender is damn second chance
<Chrysalis> whoever thought of that should be stoned to death
<BronyForLife> I just say things they should do
<Midnight_Tempest> lol borderlands?
<BronyForLife> Things like not dying..
<cow224> I know And people say cod games are realistic REALLY IN REAL LIFE SOME ONE CAN CHANGE CLASSES LIKE THERE IS NOTHING EVEN THERE dumb*** people no matter what NO game will ever be realistic CAUSE IT IS A GAME unless you can like transport your body in it then they can talk about realizem
<Chrysalis> thats not a competitive shooter
<BronyForLife> Games are never realistic
<BronyForLife> Its about how CLOSE to realism it is
<BronyForLife> bf is the closest
<cow224> I know right but people still fight about it
<killerpony7733> BronyForLife: they can have a realistic aspect but real realistic? nope
<BronyForLife> CLOSEST
<Midnight_Tempest> games arent realistic, so why do people take them seriously?
<cow224> ...
<BronyForLife> sure not even by half
<Chrysalis> BronyForLife the original steal battalion did a fiarly good attempt
<Chrysalis> you lost your save if you died in game
<cow224> NO GAME IS REALISTIC
<Chrysalis> and you lost it if you retreated too much
<BronyForLife> thats my point
<Midnight_Tempest> oh god... steel battalion... THAT DAMN CONTROLLER
<Midnight_Tempest> SO HUGE!
<Chrysalis> that controller was amazing
<Midnight_Tempest> it was awesome
<BronyForLife> picked up 1 rockets
<BronyForLife> wooo lets bomb this place!
<Midnight_Tempest> i never knew what half the buttons did, but i did find the windsheild washer button
<Chrysalis> hah
<Chrysalis> you actually had to start the mech in sequence as well which was awesome
<Chrysalis> and there was a button for everything
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<DeadpoolDash> http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/06/mwofrntview.jpg
<Chrysalis> Razer concept?
<killerpony7733> DeadpoolDash: thats pretty awesome
<DeadpoolDash> for Mechwarrior Online
<cow224> wow what is that
<Midnight_Tempest> never gonna play another 360 game though... i need to just sell my 360
<Chrysalis> but
<Chrysalis> theres no buttons
<Chrysalis> no switches
<Chrysalis> no big "Ka-Chunk" things to press
<BronyForLife> Do you need to pay to play online with Xbox?
<Chrysalis> hate touch screens
<DeadpoolDash> it has buttons and an integrated touchscreen
<Midnight_Tempest> i havent used my 360 in over a year
<flutterchu> so mature to say that
<Chrysalis> it has 12 of what look like soft-touch buttons
<Chrysalis> screw those
<Midnight_Tempest> i need to get an old steel battalion controller... and make it my joystick for mech/flying games...
<Midnight_Tempest> i will find a way to do that...
<flutterchu> die
<killerpony7733> Dat pose
<BronyForLife> Ok i pretty much lost what were talking about
<Chrysalis> Midnight_Tempest it wouldnt be too hard
<Chrysalis> the original xbox just used an oddshaped usb for the controllers
<Chrysalis> just need to get drivers
<Midnight_Tempest> and a bigger desk
<BronyForLife> Guys, whats the problem with game consoles!
<CrazyCherry> Hiya everypony.
<BronyForLife> Hey Cherry
<Midnight_Tempest> game consoles have made gaming more streamlined and shitty, thats the problem with them...
<cow224> BronyForLife: well for xbox there is two ways you can do it 1: You can buy the cards fr months and just renew when it expires Or 2:Pay a monthly fine for it about 7.99 do so if you want xbox live you should do it of the cards and not pay through credit cards
<Chrysalis> the more games become mainstream
<Chrysalis> the dumber they get
<BronyForLife> Wow
<cow224> 2: pay
<BronyForLife> I stick to ps3
<Chrysalis> cause the general public are idiots
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont even use my PS3 anymore... PC is the only way to play games
<DeadpoolDash> better pics http://www.razerzone.com/artemis
<BronyForLife> I use ps3
<BronyForLife> its made to play
<BronyForLife> So i dont need to go to the store to get a new graphic card..
<cow224> Trust me xbox is alot of money
<Chrysalis> BronyForLife yeah youll just get stuck with aging hardware
<cow224> but i still have ps3 as well and play it online
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont have to either... but i will eventually and then no game will be out of my reach, though most arent anyway
<Phase4> 00,02like a ninja

<EpicPwnTime3> what game is this?
<Phase4> 00,02i sware
<killerpony7733> Ghost30k: it's all in trying until you do it right
<Phase4> 00,02i remove rockets, adn the explosion gets bigger anyway
<d3rb> if your going to spray them with anything Quicksilver make sure its #$%ing dtrong and get ready to run like hell
<Phase4> 00,02EpicPwnTime3, kerbal space program
<d3rb> strong*
<Kencolt> Well, that didn't work out.
<Ghost30k> make the spiny thing diagonal so its less like a top
<Ghost30k> give it a foward push
<Quicksilver> I have sprayed them but they are inside the walls of the shed
<d3rb> you can buy wasp nest killer
<Klaypex> hahahahahahhahaa
<Ghost30k> BURN THE SHED DOWN
<Ghost30k> XD
<Skylands> 10!weather Cincinnati, Ohio

<Quicksilver> It's a huge mess
<Bronysith> heres how you kill a wasps nest. TACTICAL NUKE
<Skylands> 10!w Cincinnati, Ohio
<Ghost30k> lol
<d3rb> i HATE wasps, cuts your loses and burn the shed

<Ghost30k> but you need to kill 25 wasps without getting stunned though
<Ghost30k> :3
<Ghost30k> *stung
<cow334> AVATAR STATE
<Bronysith> ALL HEIL THE MIGHTY KAMINA
<cow334> YIP
<d3rb> if its really bad Quicksilver you may want to call an exterminator so you dont get owned by wasps
<Ghost30k> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh that didn't work
<killerpony7733> Nope still explodes
<d3rb> i want this rocket to work :(
<Quicksilver> I have killed a lot it must be a huge nest I will probly have to get a pro
<killerpony7733> I think the problem lies in the friction atm
<Ulthane> well, that was unexpected
<Kencolt> You know, the Nazis in WW2 tried a similar approach to VTOL. It didn't work then either.
<Ghost30k> make the sideways thrusters diagonal in a spiral IT will give it a foward pus
<Ghost30k> *push
<d3rb> they didnt have kerbal sacrafices to test on though
<killerpony7733> Phase4: My bet is in something causes a ton of friction when it gains too much speed
<Quicksilver> I think puting some rockets like this \\\\\\\\\ aronud the side would work
<MysticLugia> 12O.o
<Ghost30k> Thats what im saying
<d3rb> go baby go!!!
<Ghost30k> YES
<killerpony7733> OMG

<killerpony7733> MadSurge: we require additional kerbal sacrifices
<MadSurge> Oh whaaaaaaa :D

<MadSurge> killerpony7733: and more vespene gas
<Ghost30k> you can see his chat delay.... that's slow
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: yes indeed :O
<killerpony7733> Ghost30k: One thing is stream delay and he lives in Australia so delay is to be expected
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I know very little of Starcraft though .__.
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: i played through SC2 three times or two idunno

<Kencolt> Ghost30k: No. We love and tolerate. And snicker behind their backs because they don't know what they are missing.
<Ghost30k> killerpony7733: it just makes me look in sympathy how people are so judgemental and they haven't even watched one episode
<Kencolt> IT TOOK OFF?
<Ghost30k> killerpony7733: not sympathy, more like pity

<Sx963> good morning everypony
<Kencolt> Vordox: The other was the idea that Soviet agents were secretly planting transmitters in out denture work to spy on us, both popular Cold War theories back in the day, radio denure work. I gew UP during the Cold War.

<Quicksilver> there is always skype
<Sx963> theres an idea
<Kencolt> On IRC? Ghost30k , the POINT of IRC is TEXT chat that'sw not too bandwidth intensive-- at least these days.
<killerpony7733> Ghost30k: it's easy and simple you can use webcam or a mic really :)
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Wanna know a secret? :P

<Kencolt> Phase4: You know, maybe you should just rethink your design philosophy? Becaue, I dunno... it kinda seems to be... well... NOT WORKING?
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: i know what he needs....MORE ROCKETS
<Phase4> 00,02Kencolt, nah
<Phase4> 00,02physics is wrong
<twilight_sprinkle1> aw
<Kencolt> Phase4: There's a reason NASA didn't try this.
<Quicksilver> I'm in
<Sylandest> Phase4: screw physics, I have rockets
<[SB]Starflash> Phase4 VS Physics
<the_real_pony_1604> if you are trying to helicoper it, your engines are backwards
<[SB]Starflash> Phyyyyysiiiiiiiiiiics!!!!
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 Come on. It isnt rocket science... oh wait.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: cause nasa is boring, spinny rockets is fun
<EonMastor> that rocket eject was clearly part of the plan
*[SB]Starflash acts silly.
<Kencolt> Phase4: Now, if you could link six Pinkie Pies to those wings/foils, THEN it would work. Because by definition physics would be automatically screwed.
<Ghost30k> [SB]Starflash: Such a SHILLY FILLEY
<twilight_sprinkle1> SPIIIIIIIIN
<twilight_sprinkle1> lol

<Meanwhile> Since nothing is streaming, yes.
<twilight_sprinkle1> the buffer is undercover.

<MadSurge> Oreos are pretty good cookies. :$
<twilight_sprinkle1> Cookies? THEY-ARE-OREEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOS
*twilight_sprinkle1 kicks MadSurge
<Kencolt> Ghost30k: I think you will find, that except for Brony Movie Night, and the occaisional special plan by the mods, whatever streams here-- if anything-- can redefine random.
<Cypresswolf> Anypony planning on attending Oni Con in Galveston this year? I'm thinking about sharing the beach house with up to 2 - there's 3 bedrooms
<Ghost30k> so how do we get another thing playing
*MadSurge is kicked into a not-so-bottomless pit :D
<twilight_sprinkle1> MadSurge: damnit, i told them to dig to the other side of the planet!
<Ghost30k> anyone read that fic "My Little Dashie" :3
<twilight_sprinkle1> everyone has. except me
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle1: did you want to send me to China? :D
<Ghost30k> READ IT}
<d3rb> twilight_sprinkle1: same here
<Kencolt> Ghost30k: Whenever a mod decides to stream something, It's at theiir whim. And you never-- NEVER know what that will be outside of scheduled streaming.
<Ghost30k> oh ok Ken
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle1: didn't read it either
<twilight_sprinkle1> MadSurge: hmm, that depends on where you live, it should be the opposite siode of the earth from there :D
<Ghost30k> its fucking sad
<Cypresswolf> save someone a few hundred in hotel costs
<Ghost30k> made me cry
<twilight_sprinkle1> hm, maybe i should read it, i mcurious
<d3rb> i always say i'll read it but never get around to it
<twilight_sprinkle1> death is a cheap tear-jerker though, so if she died thatl be boring
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle1: maybe New Zealand :$
<MadSurge> ^
<twilight_sprinkle1> d3rb: yeah me neither
<Kencolt> Ghost30k: You can be assured of two things-- at one time, your mind WILL be torn from it's roots and dragged into the vfery pits of chaos and madness. This is also known as Whenerver Shizuka gets bored. And two, there WILL be at tome point, SeaPonies.
<Ghost30k> well if you don't want a massive hole in your heart don't read it or you'll uncontrollably cry for days
<twilight_sprinkle1> MadSurge: well, lets find out!
<d3rb> meh... we'll get around to,its not going anywhere
*twilight_sprinkle1 kicks MadSurge again
<Vordox> Kencolt: Phase4 = TF2, KSP, QC, Sumica = Anime of various designs, SuperBrony64 = WII /PS3 Games, Netflix, ValtjeJean = G3/G3.5 Ponies, Shizuschlafen = Sometimes anime, rather unknown, and some Audiosurf, Vivi = MUSIC!<3, Saturn = Philosophy and intelligient discussions.
<TheRandomkid321> If I where to dig to the other side of the world I would... Die from the high pressure and temparature.
<Vordox> Oh and Prince-Dari/Scoot-scootaloo = Youtube Poops
*MadSurge ends up on Mordor
<twilight_sprinkle1> MadSurge: wow, i overdid it, didjnt i :D
<TheRandomkid321> One does not simply dif into mordor.
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle1: aye :D
<killerpony7733> Vordox: forgot Wrek?
<twilight_sprinkle1> Vordox: prince-dari is more australian reality shows
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Wrek = art/music/D3
<Kencolt> Vordox: I'm with you on everything but Saturn. There seems to be a fair amoubt of random there as well. Not that random is a bad thing...
<cow334> LEE ROY
<Irish_Pony> say would saturn happen to play l4d2?
<TheRandomkid321> ... THE EXPERATION DATE ON THIS MILK LIIIIEEDD!
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: Wrek will be in vacation for three weeks :)
<Sylandest> and now...we wait...
<twilight_sprinkle1> TheRandomkid321: lol
<Ghost30k> i know there making Season 3 but is Season 4 for mlp coming out?
<Vordox> Kencolt: Indeed, but Philosophy is based on random events that should be analyzed ;)
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: as if i didn't know :D
<twilight_sprinkle1> Irish_Pony: doubtful, he said hes not into games
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle1: Never seen that show ever.
<MadSurge> Ghost30k: it's a mystery
<killerpony7733> Ghost30k: thats quite in a while if theres going to be a Season 4
<Ghost30k> lol i heard that Season 3'd gonna end it
<Vordox> inb4 TheRandomkid321 getting sick and sitting on toilet for whole day
<twilight_sprinkle1> Vordox: well maybe not australian, but shows with people with australian accents, like that ned sports thing, or bear grylls
<Vordox> Ghost30k: Season 3 is the final season yes
<TheRandomkid321> Wait. Is milk supposed to taste like mushrooms? The edible ones?
<Ghost30k> Vordox: why they have such a strong fanbase
<Vordox> Ghost30k: No income. :P
<Vordox> Ghost30k: How many here have bought ANYTHING from Hasbro?
<Ghost30k> Vordox: oh
<twilight_sprinkle1> not me, not yet
<Vordox> With the connection to MLP FIM
<twilight_sprinkle1> i plan to soon though
<Ghost30k> :(
<Vordox> Good things aren't free.
<d3rb> i bought dvds
<Ghost30k> when MLP ends ill die
<twilight_sprinkle1> i want a twi plushie!
<Kencolt> Vordox: I have. 'm rather pleased with my Ride Along Twilight Sparkle on the top of my PC desk.
<Vordox> But hey, S3 is may get continued.
<MadSurge> ^
<Vordox> Kencolt: Heh, shame alot of other cannot do it :P
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: do you have a pic?
<Vordox> S3 has only been ordered to do 13 episodes
<d3rb> i WILL buy a vinyl scratch toy
<Vordox> Not the usual 26
<Vordox> That says alot
<Ghost30k> WOW
<Ghost30k> LAMMMEE
<d3rb> they wont stop the money train
<Vordox> Money talks in this world.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: whats a ride along anyway
<Vordox> If everyone here went and bought merchandises, ica n change.
<Vordox> it can
<killerpony7733> Vordox heres to hoping they are longer then /)
<Vordox> They arenät.
<Vordox> =P
<killerpony7733> Vordox: darnit!
<MadSurge> Vordox: inb4 it's all two parters :O
<DarkStar> Hey guys
<Vordox> MadSurge: nah,
<Ghost30k> but like everyone would have to pay thousands for them to turn an eyebrow for that
<TheRandomkid321> Wait... Season 3 is the final season? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eal4fep7pK4
<Vordox> Hey DarkStar!
<Kencolt> Vordox: It's kind of cool. It's meant to be a motorised vehicle-- the headlights, handlbars,rearview mirros-- and the fact that of the three ponies in that small line, only Twilight has the SENSE TO WEAR A BUCKING HELMET is all cool.
<MadSurge> Hey DarkStar
*Vordox hugs DarkStar*
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it's all speculation.
<Vordox> Kencolt: Le...what lol?
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: i was the one who asked :D
<Vordox> You know what would be a good idea...?
<Vordox> A huge donation to Hasbro for continued MLP FIm...
<Vordox> Wonder how much that would do...
<Ghost30k> if MLP FiM ends someones gonna go on a mass killing spree
<twilight_sprinkle1> no need to donate imo
<Vordox> Ghost30k: No
<Kencolt> Vordox: There are three. Rainbow Dash on a scooter-- and a cap. Fluttershy on a cart and a headband. And Twilight on a... thing, that's obviously powered, with a helmet. With a hole for her horn.
<twilight_sprinkle1> theyll get the money cuz the show is so popular
<d3rb> donate money to hasbro :P
<killerpony7733> ^
<Vordox> Kencolt: ....Very weird but interesting design.
<Vordox> You know what
<Vordox> Screw it, I'm going to buy the Itunes now
<Vordox> Before too late. :P
<Vordox> The episodes that is
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: It's strange-- it's a classic example of the Toymakes not knowing what the hand of the animators are doing-- but it still works, in a way.
<Ghost30k> so is it confirmed only 13 episodes for season 3?
<Vordox> Ghost30k: Yes
<Ghost30k> damnit
<Vordox> Atleast public domain
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: yeah, the hasbro plushies are a fail
<Kencolt> Sigh. The Magic 65.
<Irish_Pony> ok im gonna go make sure that these new skins I got work Ill be brb
<Cypresswolf> I have way too much freedom during work hours :) I havent gotten a single call this morning - not that I'm complaining
<Vordox> But the movie will be interesting
<Vordox> MLP FIM movie
<d3rb> wasnt it 13 eps per studio?
<twilight_sprinkle1> <3 code geass music
<d3rb> since they use 2 studios?
<Vordox> d3rb: Do not know the details that well
<Ghost30k> hopefully it end up like Glee after there first season and make a shitload of money to continue the show
<Ghost30k> *their
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: What I mean is, Fluters isn't going to be going fast enough to need a helmet, Rd, well-- like she CARES, and Twilight, of COURSE she thinks of that sort of thing.
<d3rb> i had a feeling that was the jist of it, but dont quote me on that
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: lol yeah thats true :D
<SuperGotenks1989> yo
<Vordox> So who else is buying the episodes now? :P
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: Of course, there's the odd part that she has a cat. That stands at the back of the vehicle. Who holds up a book. That you can actually OPEN-- that part too, is cool.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: twi has a cat?
<Vordox> We should do it so that everyone here in BrS buys the ITunes episode
<Vordox> That alone would be like 300*Total Cost for all episodes
<Vordox> That alone is....alot
<SuperGotenks1989> ERMAHGERD
<SuperGotenks1989> MERFENZ
<d3rb> screw this, im gonna buy the season 1 boxset now
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: The toy does. Like I said, the toymakers don't apparently talk to the animators that much.
<Vordox> d3rb: ...I want dat boxset :(
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: that would explain a lot
<d3rb> i'll take a picture of it when it gets here :)
<killerpony7733> Anypony here who has L4D2?
<Vordox> Kencolt: Since you have seen alot, you saw the early days of the internet? ;D
<d3rb> hey, australia needs at least one benefit, we cant get hd eps off itunes
<TheRandomkid321> If MLP does end after the 3rd season. THE FINLE BETTER BE A ZOMPONY APOCALYPSE I SWER TO GOD!
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: Yes. FOrtunately, a PROPER Celestia is coming to Toys R Us... which I can no longer catsh a bus to. DAMN.
<TheRandomkid321> Zombies are all the rage nowadays
<Ghost30k> if this generation of MLP ends then the their will be no more MLP. At least the one that we've come to love
<Vordox> Kencolt: Ask friends or younger bronies? :)
<Kencolt> Vordox: Yes. Yes I have. And Al GOre did NOT invent it.
<Vordox> Kencolt: Heh, I know the story behind it
<Ghost30k> if someone else picks it up it will be like Halo 4, unpredictable and just not the same
<Vordox> Then Kencolt, have a memory lane thing
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMLDrXe32c&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=2
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: maybe in a while theyll get their stuff together and start making good toys, they were probably taken by surprise by the popularity
<Vordox> <---What's "famous" about the internet
<killerpony7733> Anypony that want to play L4D2? :D
<Ghost30k> I got TF2 if you'd rather play that
<Vordox> Kencolt: If you checked through youtube you should know all of these.
<killerpony7733> Ghost30k: not installed and will take ages
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle1: They aren't bad toys. They were, well, just made by toymakers thinking little girls. We are-- face it- an aberration, an anomaly, something unexpected by ANYONE connected to the project.
<d3rb> fuuuuuuuuuuu.....!!!! "Out Of Stock"
<Kencolt> And... I have to go for now. Laters.
*Kencolt waves.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Kencolt: yeah, im the plastic toys are fine, but im still not happy with the plushies
<Sylandest> laters Kencolt
<twilight_sprinkle1> bye...gone
<nonody2> I think i should give away a hat next week to somepony.
<Ghost30k> Who agrees with me that if Faust dumps MLP after Season 3 and someone else picks it up and tries to continue that Generation, it just won't be the same :(... Almost Like Halo 4
<Vordox> OH MAI GOD

<Ghost30k> d3rb: oh i didn't know that, who's running it now?

<String_Shredder> Tovler: that's just about all you can say about it
<FlareChaser> lol
<Rainbow> Vordox: HOORAY
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: i did find a countdown, but it was the same countdown for when season 2 came out :P
<noteworthy> maybe it will air that day. it's supposed to in the fall thats all i know
<FlareChaser> Let there be bees!
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/MT5o2
<Ulthane> Saturn: TopDraw has it's completion date set to 10th August, that'a all i know
<Tovler> String_Shredder: heck, the old don't talk about .MOV doesn't even need to be enforced.
<Vordox> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ISTHV2PUUBY/TroXV1lXPQI/AAAAAAAATds/vs_Y0oIYDzk/s1600/Capture.JPG
<Vordox> Tara Strong herself
<Vordox> HOWEVER
*CCCP huggles FlareChaser
<Ulthane> also, still only 13 episodes listed:/
<Vordox> This brings up a concern
<Rainbow> , and Octavie were in PARTY.MOV
<String_Shredder> Ulthane: they're probably still working on the others
<Bronysith> SWAG.MOV
<Ulthane> String_Shredder what others?
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: fawck yeah
<killerpony7733> CCCP chrysalis in a dress? :O
<Rainbow> Lyra, Bon-Bon, and Octavia were in PARTY.MOV
<Tovler> oh yeah, she was. I kinda forgot.
<CCCP> killerpony7733: yup
<killerpony7733> CCCP i would dance with her! :D
<Rainbow> CCCP: Chrysalis Gala dress?
<Barbetos|Atwork> How can you know for sure that is Tara STrong Vordox? Any one could use that screen name.
<CCCP> lol
<Vordox> Barbetos|Atwork: Witnesses :P
<CCCP> Rainbow: eeyup
<String_Shredder> Ulthane: the other episodes. Just becuase there are only 13 listed doesn't mean there are only 13 in the season
<Vordox> Ulthane: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfQzsG4_A
<Barbetos|Atwork> Vordox witnessing what exactly? Its just a screen name
<noteworthy> there should at least be 20
<MadSurge> Rainbow: and a bunch of filler OC and other ponified shows :D
<Irish_Pony> so...whos bored enough to read what I wrote for my gf?
<String_Shredder> me
<pony_9491> ...me
<Bronysith> SEASON 3 IS ONLY HAVING 13 EPISODES?!
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<CCCP> Yup
<FairysHuff> Whats the cheapest smartphone? I want to only use it for 3G connection with my ASUS Android Tablet? I never call anyone.
<DarkStar> NO Sith
<noteworthy> well i got nothin else to do so lay it on us
<CCCP> hi Cobellanez
<Irish_Pony> Bronysith: you didnt know?
<Braviary> That's just what they ordered so far, Bronysith. They might order more.
<Ulthane> Vordox woah, that's a lot of "NOOOO"
<Barbetos|Atwork> Bronysith No. It has 26, they have two different places working on 13 episodes each though.
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: SEASON 3 IS THE END...of MLP:FiM.
<CCCP> But I think the 13 episodes are going to be of extream quality
<Rainbow> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<CCCP> FlareChaser: WAT!??! :'(
<Rainbow> CCCP: They will. THey could be longer
<Vordox> Yes there will be, it will be airing in Fall 2012, I don't know when exactly thoughSource(s):Tara Strong (Mlp voice actor)
<FlareChaser> Yeah,sorry kids.
<CCCP> D:
<Irish_Pony> And soon...we'll have....Care-State o_o
<CCCP> :'(
<Rainbow> FlareChaser: YOU LIAR!
<Vordox> So
<pony_9491> How about 13 episodes. But 50 mins instead of 25mins each one?
<Vordox> It'll air within the next 3 months
<noteworthy> season 3 needs to have sea ponies before its complete
<FlareChaser> :3
<valoreins> needs more seaponies
<Rainbow> FlareChaser: THEY SAID THERE WILL BE SIX SEASONS
<CCCP> FlareChaser: u must be trolling :'(
<Rainbow> DAMMIT NO
<Vordox> Closest date I have is 17th September or later.
<Tovler> Bronies are too volatile to be told that Season 3 will be only 13 episodes.
<pony_9491> NO, i want 20 seasons and 7 movies
<FlareChaser> hey kids
<FlareChaser> Season 3
<FlareChaser> is the end
<CCCP> NO!
<FlareChaser> :3
<CCCP> :[
<Ulthane> sea ponies guys - i hope you're joking, one shoo be doo song is enough:P
<Vordox> pony_9491: I want 24 episodes, and 1 movie.
<Vordox> Don't milk stuff. =P
<valoreins> i think they need less season of MLP tbh, less creative ideas if you keep forcing a show... just look at spongebob
<Rainbow> pony_9491: For the last episode they will probably make a movie.
<Barbetos|Atwork> FlareChaser the show may end, but PONIEs WILL FOREVER BE IN MY HEART!!
<Braviary> Why do you keep saying that, FlareChaser? Just because they haven't yet signed for a fourth season, doesn't mean there won't be.
<CCCP> Well then the show will be reebooted
*Barbetos|Atwork battlecry
<Rainbow> Does My Little Dashie seem like a good episode?
<pony_9491> nope
<noteworthy> we'll make our own show.
<FairysHuff> *Snuggles into everypony in chat for love and attention*
<FlareChaser> Braviary: why do you keep falling for sarcasm?
<Vordox> Braviary: There's a high chance that Season 3 is the final one.
<Ulthane> Rainbow hell no
<Tovler> Season 3 may be only 13 episodes, but we still have Black Dynamite and The Boondocks to look forward to.
<Rainbow> Ulthane: Why the hay n ot?!
<Irish_Pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=wowy-EdU4Eg&NR=1 dat acting
<Ulthane> Rainbow because humans
<FlareChaser> Season 3 probably won't be the end, calm your tits..
<Vordox> My gut tells me this is the final season.
<FlareChaser> jesus..
<pony_9491> lol
<VioletVanilla> 06Everypony calm down. . .
<Vordox> And so far, I trust my gut, and I hate to admitit. ><
*Bronysith sits on VioletVanilla
<Rainbow> Damn.

<pony_9491> HAHBAHWAWWW WHYYY SEASON 3 WILL BE ONLY 13 EPISODES AND THE LAST ONE WHY WHY WHYY DOAWIDJOIJAWOIHDOIHOIj!?!o!=32902
*VioletVanilla ist being crushed. .
*valoreins sits on FlareChaser
<Vordox> pony_9491: Reasons.
<FlareChaser> ._.
*Sylandest pulls VioletVanilla to safety from being crushed
*Irish_Pony sits on Bronysith FlareChaser valoreins and VioletVanilla
<Tovler> Has Rob Renzetti actually left?
<FlareChaser> ow ow ow ow
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: Nope!
<Vordox> There's alot of reasons, VA, Screen Writings, Effective Ideas, Production Cost, Merhcnadise sales.
<noteworthy> aww im left in the open..
<diddutz> was there an EqD post i missed or why is everyone talking about Season 3?
<Vordox> You nae it
<Rainbow> There will still be bronies! We could all chip in to make an online version of the show!
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: you really have to be careful when these ponies try to make a pony pile :D
<pony_9491> lol
*VioletVanilla giggles
<Ulthane> Tovler about the same time as Lauren iirc
<VioletVanilla> 06I know Sylandest~
<noteworthy> yeah we have all those brony animators
<[SB]Starflash> Dat pony pile ~
<Braviary> I am not good with sarcasm.
<Irish_Pony> VioletVanilla: thats why we wub you :)
<[SB]Starflash> Ah wait... SB is probably asleep by now
*Tovler shudders thinking of the Star Trek fanmade episodes.
<Rainbow> VioletVanilla: At the ghosties?
<Starflash> there.
<Ulthane> diddutz Saturn askas an innocent question, it evolves into a full scale panic attack
<Ulthane> asks*
<pony_9491> :D
<Vordox> Well.
<Vordox> End or not, I'm sure it'll be alive for atleast 3 more years
<Rainbow> Ulthane: Poor Saturn.
<Vordox> After that, it'll dwindle off to become a cult, and thereby only remembered by those who put thought into it.
<Vordox> After that...*Shrug*
<Bronysith> Vordox: star trek and star wars has been gone for long time and theres still a massive following
<Vordox> Bronysith: Movies, Spin off, merchandise, connected with Star Wars.
<Vordox> Bronysith: Think of the connections of what Star Trek is and why it's still around.
<Bronysith> Vordox: prequels never happened
<Irish_Pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECx-42Wlho&feature=related this is how I wanna die :D
<FlareChaser> We're still having a conversation about this?
<Rainbow> Bronies could make episodes!
<Vordox> Bronysith: It did.
<FlareChaser> seriously?
<FlareChaser> really?
<pony_9491> LOL
<FlareChaser> everyone, calm the hell down, when the show ends it'll end.
<FlareChaser> done.
<FlareChaser> over
<Ulthane> Vordox fandom should be alive for far longer than that, i mean SWAT Katz fandom is still going and that cartoon wasn't very famous in the first place
*Tovler thinks about the fanmade video he saw recently.
<FlareChaser> Now talk about cookies.
<pony_9491> who wants to draw pony? http://flockdraw.com/mlpfim
<Vordox> Ulthane: I am a fan of it, I remember it as well.
<noteworthy> wow CCCP best death ever
<Vordox> Ulthane: Still I'll keep to say that it was meant for "the mass"
<noteworthy> oh wait
<Vordox> The hardcore people, or people who bring up points, will drag it to light when in time of need.
<Vordox> But. The amount of people intersted in MLP will for certain go to another part that they find interesting
<noteworthy> that was Irish.. great video :)
<Rainbow> For the premiere of the new Spider-Man movie, I'm gonna improvise a costume.
<Vordox> That's how human nature is...bleh
<GilDash> Holla, everypony! :)

<Vordox> Ulthane: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_AdxJWFUh4 <-- For you
<Tovler> About damn time. They showed 1-armed dr conner in the original trilogy but we never got to see the Lizard.

<FairysHuff> I didn't know it was Leslie Nielson that starred in the classic sci-fi film Forbidden Planet! O_O
<Ulthane> 23 episodes i think
<Starflash> Hmm, I wonder. Has anyone here seen that classy costume drama yet?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Hi
<Kandarihu> Hmm, okay. Obviously, LightIRC has a serious problem with invalid links.
<Vordox> LOl noteworthy XD
<noteworthy> I found it the other day and loved it
<Tovler> buh. I was hoping to watch the new GI Joe movie since those movies put money into FIM's budget.
<CK|Catnap> FairysHuff: Yeah, he started out trying to be a serious actor, but every time he tried to play a serious role, the movie was either laughed at or did poorly. He met with more success in comedy films, thus the eventual Naked Gun movies and such.
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PstCcgx-4AQ&feature=relmfu
<CK|Catnap> Also I saw a Vivi~

<TheRandomkid321> Well. I can't sleep. But what else is new?
<MakerDusk> who can ever?
<MakerDusk> was up till 5am
<MakerDusk> and then got up at 11
<Barbetos|Atwork> Saturn I like your os. It talks back to you. "Your system is to slow to run this!" XD
*MakerDusk is half convinced his puppy hates him for his horrible schedual
<TheRandomkid321> how old is that computer?
<Magic> wow whats with the stream
<Saturn> 08,01the computer is a quad core i7 laptop

<valoreins> bye guys
<AttackWithHugs> bye valoreins
<Magic> bye val
<TheRandomkid321> bye
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Your system is too homophobe to play this . Possible reasons : Windows
<Sylandest> oooh, this vid
<QuickThinker> ok i changed my name anyone like it?
<TheRandomkid321> o_0
<MakerDusk> lol
<Magic> its good
<MakerDusk> kinda makes me want to watch an Indiana Jones movie
<Magic> yeah
<MakerDusk> also had the superman theme
*Barbetos|Atwork hands MakerDusk Indian Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull "Problem?"
<MakerDusk> eyup
<Magic> indiana jones
<killerpony7733> QuickThinker: If you can live up to it then its better :O
<Tovler> oh poo. I really didn't get the Newsletter.
<TheRandomkid321> in my personal opinion. Indiana Jones > Star Wars.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Careful that is blasphemy to certain people.
<TheRandomkid321> Jaws. LAWL!
<MakerDusk> Barbetos|Atwork: but I promised Ghosties that I would not mess with bronystate users ;)
<MakerDusk> yay, Jurassic Park
<Barbetos|Atwork> MakerDusk What? Is Kingdom the the Crystal skull bad? *troll face*
<Magic> no
<MakerDusk> desire to mute rising :p
<Magic> it was good
<Elondras> hello everypony....what is this? :D
<Lasharus> Muted ages ago.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Magic Not... sure if serious...
<TheRandomkid321> I never found the last indiana jones movie THAT bad.
<String_Shredder> "John Williams is the man~"
<CCCP> HAylergerfuglr
<Elondras> d'aaaaw
<Irish_Pony> HNG
<MakerDusk> Lasharus: not to mute the stream, to must the crystal skull fans
<MakerDusk> ;)
<Tovler> Crystal Skull was missing something, I can't put my finger on it.
<Lasharus> Oh deary me.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Saturn Blackgryph0n has a new video out with pinkie now.
<Kandarihu> You know what? Flash is horribly unstable for me.
<Magic> i liked all of the indiana lones movies
<TheRandomkid321> TomSka :D
<Elondras> is that Tomska?? O.o
<diddutz> i know that guy and his dubstep glasses ^^
<CCCP> O_O
<AgentKalim> Herro, peopre, what are we watching?
<Kandarihu> So while the way LightIRC perceives links is a problem, Flash is as well.
<Elondras> helly yeah tomska is streaming :D
<noteworthy> wtf
<Everlasting_Joy> Suddenly, Men in Black.
<Lasharus> What in the limitless hells is this.
<Sylandest> dude, holy crap, thats tom?!
<Saturn> 08,01and it seems that mplayer really doesn't like HD video in xvfb...
<TheRandomkid321> Out os sync
<CCCP> Sylandest: yup
<Dken2021> good late morning everyone
<CCCP> hi Dken2021 :)
<MakerDusk> heya Dken2021
<Lasharus> You mean the sound delay of half a minute, give or take?
<Sylandest> CCCP: well, damn
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh heck yes!
<AgentKalim> Hello, Dken2021
<Elondras> hey Dken2021
<Saturn> 08,01well, i guess that's another thing for me to fix
<GilDash> What the hay is this?
<Magic> hi dken
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Dken2021!
<AgentKalim> I still have no idea what that was. :P
<MakerDusk> aww, I was enjoying that randomness
<GilDash> Saturn: Why? Everything was working fine! :D
<Elondras> AgentKalim a typical tomska video
<MakerDusk> GilDash: because Saturn doesn't like ponies :p
<CCCP> :o
<TheRandomkid321> I love TomSk... No ho- okay maby a lil homo.
<Dken2021> that was a tomska vid?
<MakerDusk> (if you're wondering it's my day off, and I'm so using it to relax)
<Elondras> eeeeyup
<CCCP> Is Tom Ska a brony?
<Magic> well idk but the stream keeps derpin on me
<CCCP> stil not sure
<User0> MakerDusk: lucky...
<GilDash> MakerDusk: LIES! :O
<Elondras> i don't thinks o CCCP....
<Magic> 6_9
<CCCP> Elondras: well in asdf movie 5 he had Tombstone do the soundtrack
<TheRandomkid321> Dken2021 Obviously
<Elondras> CCCP yeah but that doesn't mean anything
<Tovler> grr. now I'll have to watch BMN so I can get the lottery-reminder email.
<MakerDusk> GilDash: yes, I know admins don't get days off, but I'm taking one anyways
<MakerDusk> deal_with_it.jpg
<MakerDusk> :p
<TheRandomkid321> CCCP Edd was a brony. Before he died from Lukeimia. Tom respects bronys.
<CCCP> Elondras: i know, but they also put a pont in asdf movie 5
<CCCP> TheRandomkid321: oh
<Elondras> http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555 anyone wanna play the Pegadrome game against me?
<CCCP> :(
<GilDash> MakerDusk: You're not an admin. :S
<MakerDusk> GilDash: you might want to do a /whois on me ;)
<User0> look at the tags on Mineturtle: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BbQdlP4PaU
<ThunderCloud> Elondras Eeyup
<Elondras> CCCP yeah but i still don't think he is a brony yet...
<Tovler> lotteries are on Fridays from now on?
<CCCP> Elondras: well he might be
<User0> That should be somewhat clear on TomSka's "brony status"
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: say whaa?
<CCCP> Elondras: i wouln't be suprised if he was or not
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj8ycV7LuDA&feature=plcp
<Meanwhile> MakerDusk is best admin.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Becoming dovakhin
<GilDash> MakerDusk: Tsk, you've masked yourself. ;)
<Meanwhile> Also, I'm back from the point I left and didn't mention it.
<MakerDusk> haha, I'm one of the irc network admins
<CCCP> hi Meanwhile <3
*AttackWithHugs waves to Meanwhile'
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Meanwhile.
<Dken2021> is someone doubting MakerDusk's authority again?
<TheRandomkid321> Is Ninjazz on the chat?
<AgentKalim> Hello, Meanwhile
<Elondras> hey Meanwhile
<Everlasting_Joy> Dken2021: I think so.
<MakerDusk> Dken2021: I kinda hope you all do
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: Potentially. Silly for them.
<MakerDusk> it's not fun when you have to see me in action :(
<Meanwhile> MakerDusk please, everyone who knows you secretly fears you.
<MakerDusk> Meanwhile: you just made a sadness in my little heart
<Ninjazz> Hello
*Meanwhile hugs MakerDusk.
<Dken2021> Hello Ninjazz
<Meanwhile> Allo Ninjazz.
*MakerDusk hugs Meanwhile while sobbing
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: honestly i don't fear admins or mods but i respect them as people :)
<TheRandomkid321> HA HA! Fooled you all. I was Ninjazz THE WHOLE TIME!
<Meanwhile> Oh hey Party.mov is out.
<AgentKalim> What a twist.
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: late to the party there
<Vordox> GUS
<Vordox> GUYS
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sThcwmx3rs&feature=g-vrec
<AgentKalim> late to the party.mov
<Vordox> <---- WATCH THIS NOW
<AvisTheMartian> ok
<User0> for those who didn't actually check the link to TheLivingTombstone's Mineturtle, in the comments: "Tags: TomSka is NOT brony asdfmovie5 Hello Mineturtle BOOM"
<MadSurge> CCCP! Meanwhile! PARTY.MOV! :D
<Meanwhile> killerpony7733: Thought I might be, been absent for like 2 hours.
<MakerDusk> killerpony7733: come here you big suck up
<CCCP> MadSurge: i know
<Meanwhile> Vordox: don't have facebook.
*MakerDusk noogies killerpony7733 ^_^
*killerpony7733 is noogied 6_9
<MakerDusk> XD
<Dken2021> I haven't used my facebook in a long time
<CCCP> FaceBook kind of sucks
<Alchemist> party.mov was meh for me compared to the others.
<Dken2021> CCCP that's why I haven't used it in awhile
<CCCP> same
<Elondras> User0 :/ well that is sad
<MakerDusk> every time I go on facebook it's different
<MakerDusk> they change it way too much
<AgentKalim> I haven't used my facebook in a LOOOOOONG time. :P
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: But really i know what mods and admins are for so i know it's the persons job they follow rules which they enforce when needed so i respect them at that point :P
<User0> Elondras: at least he is pony-friendly, and that's good enough for me
<CCCP> I hope the world ends this year :P
<killerpony7733> CCCP that would suck tbh
<Dken2021> CCCP but then no ponies
<CCCP> eh i guess
<Alchemist> what? no! I have so many things left to do!
<Elondras> User0 if he is not a hater than it's all good to me too
<MakerDusk> haha, we do have quite a bit of rules to follow
<CCCP> killerpony7733: yeah i guess
<CCCP> Dken2021: ok your right there
<MakerDusk> though if we're explicitly given permission to power troll in a side channel, most of us will go for it
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: Yes that is a fact, even having to keep professional at a point
<MadSurge> Hey, who likes Octavia here?
<Elondras> Alchemist: party.mov? he made a new one?
<MadSurge> Elondras: eeeyup
<Dermathil> Hey everyone
<Alchemist> Elrondas: its been posted on EqD not so long ago
<GilDash> MadSurge: Yep. ;)
<Dken2021> hai Dermathil
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Dermathil.
<Elondras> Hey Dermathil
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: i do like many others
<Rainbow> lol
<Dermathil> quick passingby question, anybody gots spare rubies in their terraria games?
<MadSurge> GilDash: I was almost crying from laughter :D
<MakerDusk> killerpony7733: I go for a happy medium, though I've been working on that balance for ages
<Magic> wow i hate it when the stream derps
<GilDash> MadSurge: It's true. I love Octavia. :)
<MakerDusk> if you're all professionalism and business, how could you enjoy the network?
<Broken> my little pony, my little pony, aaaaaah!
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: True but it has to be a certain level to balance it out
<MadSurge> GilDash: Well you're lucky, she seems as good as her canon self even in that series :D
<GilDash> MakerDusk: You couldn't. That's why I hate formal business pracice to the nth degree. :D
<GilDash> MadSurge: Pretty much. :D
<Broken> WUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
<MakerDusk> killerpony7733: yes, thankfully my actual job helped me there
<Magic> wubs
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: Notice how i can talk a relatively normal conversation with you, Even knowing you got the power to smite me to dust :D
*MakerDusk works for American Express, so you find the balance pretty fast there
<AgentKalim> She cleans them with... wubs.
<MadSurge> GilDash: I love Pinkie, but these characters are so different that they're pretty muych other characters. This Pinkie is so miserable :D
*User0 is a programmer, and should be working right now... (ping to MakerDusk)
<MakerDusk> haha, I might have the ability, but the rules are clear and it would only hurt the network for me to do so
<Meanwhile> Wonder how long until that RD mov.
<GilDash> MadSurge: They're all so wonderful, aren't they? :D
<MakerDusk> I suppose I should be writing a program now myself, User0
<MakerDusk> need one to calculate airmiles on my calculator
<Magic> epic wub time oh yeah
<MakerDusk> since I'm getting tired of doing it by hand everytime
<MadSurge> GilDash: Aye! In the end I like more Spike, Jappleack and Fluttershy :D
<User0> MakerDusk: I'm actually at work... like my boss is within eyeshot (CEO is not here today, randomly...)
<MakerDusk> but I need to do a quick refresher on C
<MakerDusk> oh, lol
<MakerDusk> XD
<User0> MakerDusk: I also have RD on my desk and a brony wristband on - no shame
<MakerDusk> American Express is pro brony
<MakerDusk> place is littered with rainbowdash posters
<MadSurge> GilDash: How can Pinkie lose so many fluids and not die from dehydration :D
<User0> MakerDusk: If I wasn't wearing a polo, I'd probably mix a MLP shirt in here and there... (my boss is wearing a shirt: "classically trained" with a NES)
<GilDash> MadSurge: *That's* your only issue with the whole thing? :D
<User0> MakerDusk: pics?
<Elondras> Alchemist: your right...Party mov isn't that good...
<Meanwhile> you're*
<MadSurge> GilDash: I'm a weird minded guy :D Of course all of it is messed up!
<CriticKitten> >implying any .movs are good
<GilDash> MadSurge: I just like to point out that trying to focus on any one thing in a series like that is pointless. :D
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: Hey, I like them :(
<AgentKalim> Hey, it's opinions. :P
<AgentKalim> I like them too, personally.
<Meanwhile> I liked .mov when it was shorter and more random.
<MadSurge> GilDash: the blog is the only "plot" the series really has :D
<MakerDusk> User0: I have access to all credit bureau reports, American Express credit card information, address and phone numbers for celebreties and rich people
<MakerDusk> I do not have a camera or cell phone at work
<Meanwhile> That being...apple and shed I suppose. Don't mind the tumblr though.
<Dken2021> .mov's are a lot like a censor-free ren and stimpy episode...ugh
<GilDash> MadSurge: Eh, I don't really read it.
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: all that power at your finger tips? :D
<CriticKitten> :p
<Tovler> I never did see the Ren and Stimpy reboot on SpikeTv.
<CriticKitten> Dken: Except not as good.
<Tovler> I did see Stripperella though.
<MakerDusk> killerpony7733: had more fun when I worked for verizon
<MadSurge> GilDash: In case, I'll give you a quick resume when SWAG.MOV rolls around :D
<MakerDusk> if they bitched at me, I'd break their internet
<User0> MakerDusk: there are other jobs related to AE which don't physically work with the actual accounts...
<GilDash> MadSurge: Fair does. :D
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: in a sense you could litterally destroy someones life if they really made yours bad
<CCCP> ...
<Dken2021> Tovler it's alot like a typical episode, only censor-free

<MakerDusk> I suppose I could, killerpony7733
<MakerDusk> a couple of clicks and I could destroy someone's life for the next 7 years
<Meanwhile> And then MakerDusk turned to cybercrime.
<User0> MakerDusk: also, I have a rather large code database (upwards of a million lines without comments) at my fingertips, but that doesn't mean I can't bring in a flash drive....
<Lasharus> That'd be impolite of you MakerDusk.
<AgentKalim> And then Shadowrun happened, the end.
<MakerDusk> to say the least
<Meanwhile> Hackers.
<Lasharus> And why seven years? That seems curiously specific.
<MakerDusk> yet people still call in and yell at me
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk: Still despite that power, Wouldn't it be harder then heck to actually do it since it could be easily noticed?
<pony_9996> Stream still down?
<Lasharus> Eh, I work in customer service. I could make people's lives a living hell if I so choose.
<MakerDusk> Lasharus: that's the lifecycle of credit bureau reports
<Lasharus> "Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm seeing a debt of 40000 euros here in the system."
<Lasharus> "Needs to be paid before wednesday, of course."
<Elondras> Lasharus :D
<MakerDusk> oh no, there's a way around that
<killerpony7733> Lasharus: soudns like a troll job to me atleast if you were a troll
<Lasharus> I'd probably get fired for pulling a stunt like that. :P
<Dken2021> Lasharus, you monster
<Lasharus> Some people deserve it. :P
<MadSurge> GilDash: We need to keep Saturn seeing it though, he likes Pinkie too :D
<MakerDusk> if CMs are really stupid, we'll do as they order us and let them destroy their credit rating
<Lasharus> "Why do I have to pay my debt!" "Because... you loaned money. That's sort of the point." "No I don't! I'll complain about you!"
<CCCP> :/
<Lasharus> I actually had a formal complaint from the guy because he was angry I told him that he had a debt he had to repay. The fact that he'd missed payment on at least six terms in a row was a hint...
<MakerDusk> but in all fairness, I enjoy my job
<User0> MakerDusk: chainsaw of natural selection, financial edition?
<GilDash> MadSurge: *That* Pinkie though? :D
<Lasharus> Oddly, the complaint had no repercussions.
<Elondras> Lasharus "sure! my name is *calls the name of another worker* good luck with your complaining"
<Meanwhile> Lasharus: Dodged a bullet there huh,
<Lasharus> Yeah. Luckily my employers aren't idiots.
<Lasharus> And I don't hate my coworkers enough Elondras.
<MadSurge> GilDash: that's what I'm saying, *that* Pinkie is really gross :D
<MakerDusk> haha, I got an email yesterday
<Barbetos|Atwork> Lyra everywhere I drive? Do want. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lyra-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-Decal-Vinyl-Sticker-/120936295621?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c285d6cc5#ht_600wt_952
<MakerDusk> a CM had written in telling american express to find me and thank me
<GilDash> MadSurge: I'll let you take the flak for that. I've already got enough problems. :p
<MakerDusk> so I got a scan of the letter
<MakerDusk> was a huge ego booster >_<
<Lasharus> Neat. :P
<AttackWithHugs> Barbetos|Atwork: Nice. All they have is Lyra at the moment?
<MadSurge> GilDash: you're the local no-good here :D
<Lasharus> One of my coworkers had a lovely day there. I was sitting next to him when he was being taught the ropes.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Not by design! :D
<Lasharus> What happened? The customer praised his service into the high heavens.
<MakerDusk> also, dawww the puppy went into an ac coma
<Barbetos|Atwork> AttackWithHugs scroll down. It is a whole store.
<User0> I know a guy who makes decals - he owns one of those machines...
<Lasharus> He breaks off the call with a huge smile, and then got told by the trainer: "Yeah, nice of him, but you were completely wrong."
<Lasharus> Ouch.
<MakerDusk> lol
<Elondras> fail
<mitamaking> Ah no video
<Lasharus> Rather.
<AvisTheMartian> yup
<Lasharus> He didn't make it in the end.
<Lasharus> I'm not even finished with my own training though, so I shouldn't talk TOO loudly. :P
<AttackWithHugs> Barbetos|Atwork: One of every one for me! (if I had the money)
<MakerDusk> the puppy looks so adorable, but if I pet her, she'll wake up and want to go out
<MakerDusk> catch 22 here
<Lasharus> ?
<Saturn> 08,01Lasharus: SPILL ALL YOUR SECRETS, SECRET PONY
<Lasharus> All my secrets about what?
<MakerDusk> Lasharus: and where do you work?
<Saturn> 08,01everything!
<AgentKalim> Oh no, Saturn is going full canterlock
<Lasharus> MakerDusk: Government - education department customer service.
<Chrysalis> oh no
<Chrysalis> a saturn is here
<AttackWithHugs> AgentKalim: Is that a goo thing or bad thing?
<AttackWithHugs> good*
<MakerDusk> ah
<Lasharus> I essentially handle questions about everything from signing up for a new study to paying back loans on study financing.
<AgentKalim> I don't know... yet. :P
<Elondras> brb
<Lasharus> Here's one I'm not supposed to talk about Saturn:
<User0> Saturn: btw, I forgot to mention to you that I forced you to un-eat me since I needed to attend a status meeting, but it is over now...
<MakerDusk> haha, you call the number on the back on your amex, and you could end up speaking to me
<Lasharus> One customer had a debt of over 150.000 euros. Built up over 4 years.
<Saturn> 08,01User0: it's okay, i'm no longer hungry
<User0> Saturn: that works.
*User0 nuzzles Saturn.
<Lasharus> I'm still astonished as to how he managed it.
<Saturn> 08,01Lasharus: bloody hell
<Lasharus> Yeah.
<Saturn> 08,01on his credit card?
<Chrysalis> Lasharus how, he must of had a stupid amount of creditcards etc
<Lasharus> No, for his studies. We handle loans for education, study financing, etc.
<Lasharus> We don't give a toss about credit cards, thank god.
<Saturn> 08,01Lasharus: oh
<Karaoke> boredom sucks
<Lasharus> But still, 150k? That's insanely high.
<AgentKalim> Hey, can someone please tell me how to enable gameserv in a room? I wanted to run a Roleplaying is Magic game through chat and I'd like a convenient way to roll dice.
<Dken2021> Karaoke at least you have us :)
<Karaoke> hey, AgentKalim!
<Karaoke> true
<AgentKalim> Howdy, Karaoke
<Lasharus> He'd have to have loaned the maximum amount, gotten every single form of credit and financing in the book, and even then it would be hard to get that high.
<Lasharus> Another customer was just as intelligent. He complained about being sent to a collection agency for his debt.
<Lasharus> He´d managed to not pay a grand total of 101 months. In a row.
<Lasharus> The moment he returned to the Netherlands and supplied us with an address?
<Lasharus> *PING* money please.
<Lasharus> He really would've been better off staying abroad.
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'm currently in abotu £20,000 of student loan debt
<MakerDusk> XD
<Lasharus> That's pretty close to the Dutch average Saturn.
<MakerDusk> I'm only 8k in the hole
<Lasharus> The Dutch is a bit lower. I think it's around about 14.5k
<Lasharus> I've only got 3000, and I intend to pay it off as soon as I've saved up some.
<Lasharus> I don't want it hanging over my head.
<MakerDusk> I'm still shocked at how much I had managed to pay on my own
<MakerDusk> now I just need one more year
<Saturn> 08,01we just pay it off as part of our tax, basically
<Saturn> 08,01and we only pay it off once we're earning above a certain amount
<MakerDusk> :O
<Lasharus> Oh we have similar arrangements.
<MakerDusk> Saturn: what country do you live in?
<Saturn> 08,01MakerDusk: the uK
<Chrysalis> Saturn and it gets wiped if we dont earn above that in 15 years
<Om> Hurray learning costs!
<Saturn> 08,01we need to start paying back if we're earning over £15,000 a year or something
<Lasharus> If you have a loan, you pay off based on how much you've got in debt. If you can't support yourself along with the debt, you can request for your income to be measured, which may lead to a reduction in the monthly fee.
<MakerDusk> hmm, I suppose I could get an EU passport
<Lasharus> Don't call me, I'm expecting you now.
<Magic> wow damn youtube wont even play today
<GilDash> Saturn: That's not right. I'm above that and not paying yet. :S
<Saturn> 08,01MakerDusk: if you're an EU citizen, you'll be treated the same as a scottish citizen wrt student finance
<GilDash> Saturn: I think it was 20, or 21k.
<Lasharus> "Hi, I'm looking into possibilities for getting an EU passport." "Is that you MakerDusk?" "...how?"
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: maybe it's £20k? yeah
<GilDash> Saturn: Must be. :D
<MakerDusk> Saturn: what does that mean?
<Om> Thats a lot o monies
<MakerDusk> Lasharus: I'd be going through different channels
<Saturn> 08,01MakerDusk: curiously though, if you're from England, you get a lot less student support
<MakerDusk> since my family lives there on my mother's side
<Lasharus> I know. I wouldn't handle passport requests, completely out of my area of government. :P
<MakerDusk> hungary
<Lasharus> Still, I'm getting very positive evaluations by my trainers, so I'll probably have the job definitely soon. :)
<Saturn> 08,01MakerDusk: do you have dual citizenship?
<MakerDusk> I don't
<GilDash> Saturn: That's cause the UK's finances are fucked up five ways to Friday. :D
<MakerDusk> but my mother and grandparents do
<killerpony7733> Saturn: i do :D
<Saturn> 08,01you'd need to get it first, then you'd be able to get your tuition fees paid by the state, and get a student loan in scotland
<MakerDusk> well, one of my grandparents only has an EU one
<MakerDusk> she really shouldn't be in canada
<MakerDusk> >_<
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: yes, so true. and scottish people don't like the english. if you're from anywhere in the EU, except England, even if you're from Ireland or Wales, you get free tuition in Scotland
<Saturn> 08,01if you're from England, NOPE
<GilDash> Saturn: Seriosuly, we have a ministry in Wales, Scotland and England. It's no sodding wonder the country's fucked. :S
<killerpony7733> Saturn: I am by birthright a citizen of greenland, but my full blooded danish heritage makes me a danish citizen too :)
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: exactly
<GilDash> Saturn: That's okay. I love the Scottish anyway. :)
<AgentKalim> Scottish are pretty cool.
<Lasharus> By birthright I'm Dutch. By mannerisms I'm British.
<killerpony7733> Suddenly stream
<GilDash> Saturn: Just don't go all nationalising off from us, okay? I don't think we could survive. :D
<Vordox> SUDDENLY OW
<twilight_sprinkle1> GAH
<AttackWithHugs> Suddenly, John Mayer
<Saturn> 08,01i'm considering going to Sweden to do my masters
<Lasharus> People keep telling me I'm "more British than most Brits"
<AgentKalim> Suddenly, stream blasts my ears.
<MadSurge> Derpy! <3
<QuickThinker> dawwwwww so cute :3
<TheRandomkid321> ARGH! Oh. The stream startled me. I forgot about it.
<Sundaysmile> Truthfully Scottish People don't like anyone

<GilDash> Chrysalis: I shall have to go queing in the post office, but you'll find my letter with you by Friday. :)

<MadSurge> Saturn: what :D
<Lasharus> Sorry, but can't beat Stephen Fry in Britishness. For me, at least.
<Chrysalis> actually... i am drinking tea right now :S
<AgentKalim> How does Twilight Sparkle taste?
<TheRandomkid321> I still cannot sleep. I'll try again in half an hour.
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: it's an Ask Princess Molestia tumblr joke

*MakerDusk is in :p
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Absolutely spiffing. :)
<Saturn> 08,01noteworthy: I WANT TO LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE
<Lasharus> Ceylon's not too bad Chrysalis, but I'm inclined to agree that Earl Grey's great.
*Saturn 08,01hates the rain
<killerpony7733> Dat theme
<TheRandomkid321> What just happened and oh no. the tears...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Am I the only one who thinks this music is overrated?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't like Earl Grey
<GilDash> Saturn: Heh, I love the snow. :)
<MadSurge> Awww sad music :(
<Vordox> I wanna hear the Save the queen now...
<noname> ^
<MakerDusk> but the sun is so hot
<Saturn> 08,01bergamot gives me an upset stomach
<Chrysalis> Lasharus iv gotten quite fond of a lavender version recently
<Saturn> 08,01i like Assam
<Chrysalis> have you tried it?
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: i kinda forgot where it was from
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: It is overrated, PLAY SAVE THE QUEEN
<User0> Chrysalis: There is a keurig machine within eyeshot and a endless supply of earl grey...
<Saturn> 08,01and Lapsang Souchung
<Lasharus> That happens to some people Saturn.

<TheRandomkid321> Argh. Zombies. Islands... Holidays... Hothothot biini zombies.. argh
<MakerDusk> and I love tea, celestia damn it!
<Lasharus> No, although currently I'm drinking Earl Grey Darjeeling.
<AttackWithHugs> What song is this?
<AgentKalim> Hnnnnnnnng this picture
<Saturn> 08,01i like darjeeling
<EggWhite> Why does the Queen need saving?
<MakerDusk> but we have timmies here
<Chrysalis> User0 that sounds amazing, far better than my current surroundings of a single tea cup, and about 15 mtn dew bottles
<Saturn> 08,01Lasharus: is that just darjeeling with bergamot?
<Vordox> Diiinkyyy...Deerpyyy...
*Vordox bawls.
<MakerDusk> timmies has best steeped tea
<MadSurge> Why must we give a bullism past to Derpy :'(
<GilDash> Saturn: That's far too much tea for me. :D
<Lasharus> It's a mix of flavours, basically.
<Lasharus> But it's quite good.
<QuickThinker> so sad :C
<MakerDusk> could not leave the country and leave timmies
<Saturn> 08,01i once had a boyfriend who tasted of darjeeling...
<TheRandomkid321> I honestly find this montge overly long and boring.
<User0> Chrysalis: this is why I love my job (yes I'm at work right now...)
<AgentKalim> Oh come on that's a low blow, stream
<MadSurge> ^
<Lasharus> And Saturn, it could be that you're slightly allergic to Bergamot. My grandmother was.
<User0> Chrysalis: and there is food galore too (along with other drinks as well)
<Lasharus> We once gave her a cup of tea without knowing about it. She basically got stoned.
<Lasharus> Hilarious.
<Chrysalis> ARG, how hard is it to realise, if a chest only contains cobble, put cobble in there
<GilDash> Saturn: I am laughing too hard right now. :D
<Chrysalis> dont put it in the other chest further from the entrance
<MadSurge> :O

<drf|laptop> 03considering it still looks bad with that much zoom anyway
<Stallion_of_War> This is intersting... I'm wating for the Yogbox to boot
