<Jim> Cya later
<Gumri> Should i go to a meetup in April or should i just go to the Bronycon?
<Gumri> in the same month
<MirrorImage> why not both?
<Gumri> i could...
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, there's a meetup at MCM
<Gumri> I like in the UK
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, MCM is in the UK
<Gumri> live*
<Gumri> oh
<Gumri> well wtf is MCM
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, a sort of gaming/anime/cosplay/other stuff expo kind of thing
<Gumri> oh
<ScootaChicken> the last one was in October, there was a brony meetup there
<Gumri> You see here is the problem: I am 16 and still living at home. My mum does not understand my bronyness and then i tell her i want to go to a con for a couple of days...
<Gumri> She will be wierded out.
<Gumri> It's a tough situation.
<Dken2021> have any friends that can accompany you?
<Gumri> nooooooo
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, its only one day, you can just say you're meeting a bunch of your friends
<ScootaChicken> thats what I did last time
<ScootaChicken> and plus, its technically true....
<Gumri> Ah but the con is overnight.
<Berry_From_Mars> Confound these ponies, They drive me to avoid sleep...
<Gumri> and I am helping sort out the con so i really want to be there.
<Berry_From_Mars> Actually, I exaggerate... If I went to bed 10 hours ago I would have slept.
<Gumri> I need an excuse of some description.
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, isn't Bronycon in America?
<Dken2021> yup it is
<Gumri> no we are starting a small one in Manchester.
<ScootaChicken> :O
<MirrorImage> Gumri - the more you try to hide it, the worse off it will be when your parents find out
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, link nao
<ScootaChicken> I need to be there
*Jim was just assaulted by two friends of my brother
<Gumri> No site yet but i'll tell you when there is one.
<MirrorImage> you'll be better off in the long run talking to your parents and finding out what their concerns are
<Gumri> You think
<MirrorImage> yes
<MirrorImage> if you try to lie to your parents and they find out, you'll have hell to pay
<Gumri> I can tell my pals but my parents is another thing alltogether.
<Gumri> aagh!
<MirrorImage> do your parents know you're a brony or do you just think they won't understand if you come out of the stable?
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, why don't you say you have a sleepover or something?
<Jim> You could always move out
<Gumri> im 16 Jim :D
<Dken2021> he's 16 btw
<Jim> I know people who moved out when they were 16 :P
<MirrorImage> and those people were probably prepairing for it since they were 14
<ScootaChicken> or just say you're going on a road trip or something, no need to mention your bronyness
<Gumri> Well they know i enjoy MLP but they do not approve. I ordered aa Derpy shirt yesterdat.
<Dken2021> oh
<Jim> Ooh, which derpy shirt, may I see?
<MirrorImage> right, so talk to your parents and find out exactly WHY they don't approve
<Gumri> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=1627
<MirrorImage> then do your best to allay those concerns
<Kammerjunk> "Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?" The poster bearer cried.
<Dken2021> lali-ho Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> "Listen son," said the man with the gun, "There's room for you outside."
<Jim> oo, that's an awesome shirt
<Gumri> But they don't approve already. When i tell them im going to bronycon... good lord.
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Celestia bless you that fateful day.
<MirrorImage> DON'T tell them you're going to bronycon yet
<MirrorImage> for that matter, don't get your hopes up that you'll be able to go
<Kammerjunk> You should show them Ballad of a Brony first.
<Gumri> yeah...
<MirrorImage> if you can't get them to at least respect that you enjoy MLP, you'll never make any progress
<ScootaChicken> Kammerjunk: so I herd u liek Pink Floyd?
<MirrorImage> step 1 is to make them accept that you like it and respect that decision
<MirrorImage> step 2 doesn't happen at all (possibly ever) if that doesn't happen
<Gumri> or i could be going to a friends sleepover... I could go by train!
<Kammerjunk> ScootaChicken: I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
<ScootaChicken> just like I said Gumri...
<Dken2021> no, I think ScootaChicken's right on this one
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: When I went to my first meetup, my parents didn't know I was a brony.
<MirrorImage> and again... lying to your parents will cause more hell than you know
<Gumri> I know... it's not a good idea but i think it's the only idea.
<Kammerjunk> I just told them I was meeting some online friends in Odense.
<Jim> Secrets and lies, these ponies are nothing but secrets and lies.
<Kammerjunk> Keep in mind that Odense is a completely different island here in denmark.
<Gumri> I could say it is a con but not what specificaly!
<emangamer> hey everypony
<Gumri> aha!
<Jim> ohai emangamer
<Gumri> Hey emangamer
<Dken2021> lali-ho emangamer
<Kammerjunk> Avê, emangamer.
<emangamer> thought I'd stop in before class :)
<Kammerjunk> I thought I'd stop by in class, but then class ended.
<Gumri> I am shaking just thinking about this. Celestia watch over me.
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-silly-spike.png
<emangamer> MOTHER OF GOD: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-make-it-cooler.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: The way I see, any parent should accept their child's likings, even if they don't necessarily understand or agree with them.
<Dken2021> it would sell by the millions
*Jim takes off glasses "Mother of celestia"
<Dken2021> but might be taken down by apple in a few days
<Gumri> You know what Kammerjunk You are right! Fuck what they think i am going to this con.
*Jim brohoofs Gumri
<Jim> That's the spirit
*Gumri brohoof
<Kammerjunk> That's what I had going through my mind when I told my parents. They still think I'm a little weird, though.
<Jim> When's BronyCon?
<Kammerjunk> Then again, they just generally do that.
<PinkiePie101> Good morning everypony :3
<Dken2021> morning PinkiePie101
<Berry_From_Mars> Good Morning indeed.
<Jim> ohai PinkiePie101
<Kammerjunk> Salvê, PinkiePie101.
<Gumri> Who cares if they think you're wierd! You are a brony!

<MirrorImage> 1) no one is on with access to the stream
<Gumri> Ballard of the brony is an hour long Kammerjunk :D

<Berry_From_Mars> Aw man, I'm enjoying this cover of the Zombies song "She's Not There"...

<TrixieMuffin> Everyone who believes in telekinesis , raise my hand
<Kammerjunk> TrixieMuffin: It doesn't matter. Anypony with a Trixie related name are forgiven for everything in my books.
<sonicrainboomer259> you can only use image links
<Jim> http://creativejamie.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/zelda-send_link.jpg
<moop> really? oh ok
<PinkiePie101> Back
<PinkiePie101> Hello moop
<moop> hi
<Kammerjunk> That only applies when a stream is going on.
<Gumri> I really like this star trek online game.
<sonicrainboomer259> lol good example
<Kammerjunk> Else, you can link YouTube.
<sonicrainboomer259> hold on,brb
<Dken2021> O U Jim
<Gumri> The moment when you realise your best friend is a brony hateing jock.
<sonicrainboomer259> checked rules if u like linking,gotta get permission from mods
<Kammerjunk> Yes, but another rule is no caps, which isn't mentioned on the rule page either.
<Dken2021> it's ok, don't think any are on atm
<Kammerjunk> All I ever get told by mods is that video links aren't allowed during streams.
<Gumri> thiss is only on movie night or ponyday though
<Gumri> i believe
<Dken2021> plus there's no stream atm so go
<sonicrainboomer259> and it said no video or outside links6_9
<Jim> During stream, yes, because it's considered impolite to the streamer
<Gumri> you are allowed pics.
<moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=krOQzrVCNSE
<Dken2021> well since there's no activity atm, there's nothing wrong with linking a video
<Gumri> I can see that actually: "This streamer is boring, youtube is better"
<sonicrainboomer259> see ya,gonna play lord of the rings
<Gumri> uuugh
<Gumri> lord of the rings
<PinkiePie101> moop: LOL. I love that video
<Dken2021> also, still need to walk dog
<moop> me too
<PinkiePie101> oh god it loops
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Well, I do that anyway, but that's because I don't like things such as Final Fantasy or Mario games.
<sonicrainboomer259> lololol
<Kammerjunk> But I see your point.
<sonicrainboomer259> omg ezio pony
<Jim> Oh sheesh, my facebook got spammed

<moop> http://www.deviantart.com/download/281196367/rainbow_dash_cute_face_vector_by_esipode-d4nf0i7.png

<moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL837883F65F45179A&v=JF4_-6Rq--A
<Fazana> RD has a petface
<Dken2021> if anyone hasn't noticed, the derpy thing is like eggman/robotnik and griffith/drummond all in one
<Rain> ^
*Ictiv comes in.
<moop> but derpy was our derpy:'(
<Ictiv> Hello everybody...
<Ictiv> You're going to be so disapointed in me...
<Jim> Hi Ictiv
<Rain> why?
<Ictiv> Well... I was continuing my catch up with Doctor Who
<Rain> Ictiv what did you do you naughty colt!?
<Ictiv> I reached Season 5, aka the first season of Matt Smith
<moop> Doctor Whooves*
<Dken2021> people complaining about the voice and name, it's stupid really
<Ictiv> and well...
<Rain> You didnt fall in love with Matt did you? :o
<Ictiv> I kind of like Matt Smith
<Fazana> I've just noticed that Daring do has RD's hairstyle, but greyscaled
<Rain> thats ok Ictiv
<Ictiv> Rain: :|
<Rain> to each their own ^_^
<Dken2021> Daring Do's pretty much a recolor of dash
<Ictiv> No I mean seriously. If copying Tennant was the goal then he failed miserably, yes
<Rain> She /is/ a recolor of dash
<Ictiv> but every single doctor failed at copying the previous
<Ictiv> Did you even SEE what he was like in the first incarnation?
<Rain> Ictiv we honestly dont care if you do or do not like Matt silly. To each their own ^_^
<Ictiv> I know.
<Rain> I kinda like Matt too. Mostly because I just like Doctor Who and dont really care who is acting. :p
<Ictiv> But I'm upset that people call him a bad actor
<Fazana> First doc was DR4ADFUL
<Ictiv> He's doing a great job, just not Tennant's way
<Fazana> His script is crap, that's all the problem is.
<Rain> Ictiv it is oppinion. Dot get upset about people with differing ones please. ^_^
<Ictiv> Fazana: Try watching episode 1 of Season 4
<moop> Favorite doctor?
<Ictiv> Rain: I'm not upset about their opinion. I'm upset that they tried to make me NOT watch season 5
<Fazana> I never even tried to bother with the earlier doctors
<Ictiv> He's not that bad
<Rain> in all honesty, the only thing that I dont like about Matt is his face :p
<Fazana> The earliest I know by heart is Tom Baker.
<Ictiv> Fazana: Do your self a favour: Bother with them
<Ictiv> Espicially 4th
<Rain> ^
<Ictiv> Especially*
<Krakass> Tennant is best Doctor
<Rain> Tennant is fucking awesome
<Rain> but the other docs do good too
<Ictiv> Yeah Tennant is awesome... But he doesn't have *single teardrop* The scarf
<moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL837883F65F45179A&v=Jkmy0bq9jk0
<Cypresswolf> 6) Waiting for the next installment of *book series*
<Rain> if you try to compair the docs to the best doc then of course you will think they are bad. I just watch the show with a smile on ^_^
<moop> Rain thats not a smiley face :P
<Cypresswolf> 7) Sleep deprived like me
<Rain> yes it is. ^_^
<moop> the mouth is not curved
<Rain> Cypresswolf: are you posting that to the right channel?
<moop> :)
<Rain> moop: the curved version of that looks wierd. Also, I smile without curving my mouth irl
<Ictiv> Rain: There is no Best Doc actually. There is "Most Bad Ass Doc" "Wisest Doc" "Scarfiest Doc" " 'So then, who wanna jump into a black hole with me'--iest Doc" etc
<Rain> you can smile without using your mouth if you are good enough at conveying emotion ^_^
<moop> i cant smile unless im watching FiM
<Cypresswolf> yes...I posted earlier (12 minutes) I was thinking up ways Screw Loose went crazy :)
<Rain> ah ok then Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> I'll stop if its considered spamming
<moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=bmxyd6co6Qw
<Ictiv> Cypresswolf: 8) She had a conversation with me.
<Ictiv> Curiously enough 8 is also my lucky number
<Rain> Ictiv that is true. But the best doc is the doc that can get the closest to as many of the catagories as possible
<Ictiv> and I just got in on time
<Cypresswolf> First 5 incase you missed them...
<Rain> Jump in the line. Rock your body on time. Ok I believe you.
<moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zdAGVp7K-H4
<Ictiv> Rain: Not neccesarily
<Rain> :p
<Ictiv> Rain: That may lead to a Mary Sue at times
<Cypresswolf> Didn't recover from Discord, Brained by Derpy deliveries, Too many Pinkie parties, Lived in Ponyville too long, Waiting in line for Apple Family's Cider
<Yellowquiet> i everypony
<Jim> ohai Yellowquiet
<Rain> the best doc, Ictiv, is your favorite doc. It changes from person to person ^_^
*Yellowquiet hugs everypony
<Dken2021> i Yellowquiet
<Ictiv> Rain: Ah. Okay then, thought you meant as a global thing... 4th is best doc though.
<Rain> what is that list for Cypresswolf ?
<Ictiv> I would huggle his scarf all day

<Rain> that one ^
<Dken2021> or mostly it's from sealab2021
<TrixieMuffin> no screw loose , the barkingmental patient in read it and weep
<Cypresswolf> Screw Loose is the barking pony in Read It & Weep
<Rain> oooooohhhhhhh
<Rain> I call her Fifi
<Rain> because dogs
<Ictiv> I prefer Fido actually
<Ictiv> I know its male
<Rain> next time you see her call her Fifi and you will laugh your ass off
<Ictiv> but Fido is best zombie pet

<PinkiePie101> TABLE FLIPPER!
<PinkiePie101> :D
<Ictiv> prince-dari: I wonder, on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 is "Stop with your stupid questions and go jumping in a field of happiness or something" and 10 is "If you would be my son, I'd have no son" and 2-9 are only there for being pretty) how dissapointed are you in me for Liking Matt Smith?
<Yellowquiet> @Coolmeter Wonderbolts

<Dken2021> hey DCD
<Yellowquiet> yay
<prince-dari> Ictiv: I don't feel disappointed at all. I just feel sad and pity that one of my fellow man has been taken in by his terrible acting.

<Jim> @Coolmeter Matt Smith
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Matt Smith is 70% Cool. (1015)
<Ictiv> prince-dari: Seriously how is he a bad actor? I mean sure he's nothing like Tennant but that is not a bad thing. None of the actors copied the previous ones.
<Cypresswolf> aww, now we'll never know which pony is crazier
<PinkiePie101> 90% Cool anyone?
<NewDCD> 09,01>Jim Carrey

<moop> 20% cooler
<Yellowquiet> @Coolmeter Yellowquiet
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Yellowquiet is 56% Cool. (1016)
<Ictiv> Look at the first Doctor for example. If you took his acting and put it next to Tennant you wouldn't know they are the same character
<prince-dari> I'm sorry, but have you seen his pathetic delivery of lines.
<Yellowquiet> i rule
<PinkiePie101> 20% cooler than 90%?
<Ictiv> prince-dari: Okay, name an example
<prince-dari> He manages to make what should have been funny lines either annoying or just pathetic.
<PinkiePie101> That's 110%
<prince-dari> He can't have any serious situations either.
<Cypresswolf> Im going to take a nap and then study some more...its going to be an all nighter tonight :|
<prince-dari> If it's supposed to be serious, he's still trying to play it as though he's some cartoony 'derp derp I'm so funny' character.
<Jim> Without yelling that is
<Yellowquiet> Sweet Dreams Cypresswolf
<Jim> Good night Cypress
<prince-dari> And as I've said before, I saw an episode of the series he was in, because it was rumoured the next Doctor was in it.
<Ictiv> prince-dari: You call him derped?... Have you even seen episode 1 of Season 4?
*PinkiePie101 explodes due to madness. (And no, it's not sparta.)
<Ictiv> That's Tennant teritory
<prince-dari> I didn't even think for a second it would be him, because his acting was vastly outshone by this black actor in the show, who wasn't even the main character. I thought he would be the next Doctor.
<prince-dari> Smith didn't stand out at all, I barely even noticed he was there.
<Dken2021> hmmm, wouldn't mind a black doctor
<Ictiv> prince-dari: Hold on... You saw ONE episode?
<Ictiv> A single one?
<prince-dari> I thought FOR SURE they must have gone with the vastly superior actor.
<Ictiv> You call him a bad actor over ONE episode?
<prince-dari> No of the new series.
<prince-dari> Not*
<prince-dari> Of Doctor Who

<prince-dari> Of a different show Matt Smith was in
<prince-dari> Before Doctor Who
<Ictiv> prince-dari: I mean of his episodes
<Ictiv> ah
<moop> FUCK! i just watched the animated version of cupcakes!
<prince-dari> I've seen 2 whole series of Matt Smith.
<prince-dari> That's why I hate him with such vigour.
<Yellowquiet> moop you are mad
<Yellowquiet> i can never watch that
<moop> i am sad
<Yellowquiet> never talk about
<Yellowquiet> it
*PinkiePie101 revives himself
<prince-dari> And Doctor Who always has both comical and serious moments.
<prince-dari> That's nothing to do with Tennant.
<Dken2021> don't be sad, there are ponies to cheer you up
<PinkiePie101> huh? What happened? :o
<prince-dari> But Smith can't pull off either.
<prince-dari> IMO
<moop> well its not as bad as that time i came across BestGore.com
<NewDCD> 09,01okay folks
<Dken2021> moop, just stop right there
<Yellowquiet> wats bestgore ?

<PinkiePie101> o.e
<moop> just pleeeeeeeasssssssssseee dont look up
<Yellowquiet> ok ^^
<PinkiePie101> *looks up* ^^^^
<PinkiePie101> JK :3
<Ictiv> prince-dari: Okay. You don't like him? Okay. But for god's sake do NOT go around saying he's the worst thing in history. I like him. I think he does a good job. He may not deliver in a way that you were expecting or that you enjoy, that's fine. But do not say it in a way that may prevent people for finding out on their own as it almost did for me
<Yellowquiet> brb
<prince-dari> Ictiv: I can say he's the worst thing in history if I want, that's my opinion, and I'm entitled to it
<prince-dari> Just as you can like him if you want
<prince-dari> I reserve my right to strongly disagree
<moop_please_dont_ban> I will never post links again
<prince-dari> Read our rules moop.
<Dken2021> moop_please_dont_ban, no need to worry, just don't talk about grotest stuff here
<Dken2021> for the sake of celestia
<NewDCD> 09,01great. The encoder is derping. Gotta restart.
<Ictiv> prince-dari: I don't say you can't have that opinion
<NewDCD> 09,01brb
<prince-dari> "But for god's sake do NOT go around saying he's the worst thing in history"
<Ictiv> I'm saying that you shouldn't out right say "don't watch Matt Smith"
<prince-dari> I can say that if I want.
<Ictiv> I missed out the word "please"
<prince-dari> It's what I believe.
<Dken2021> let's just say opinions are opinions
<Yellowquiet> back
<PinkiePie101> k
<Ictiv> prince-dari: Okay. Guess what? There are a bunch of people out there who think we are a satanist group for being Bronies. I'm not going to judge them on that but I also reserve the right to try and make them at least tolerate us
<Yellowquiet> what happend moop
<prince-dari> Some of the writing for his episodes are just terrible too, worse than pretty much any of the previous new who series.
<Dken2021> my grandmother would like to watch a movie, but she be rather happy if it starred a black person, just her opinion
<prince-dari> The new angels episode? Fucking ruined them entirely
<prince-dari> One of the best villains from Who, and they were just ruined.
<prince-dari> Then suddenly the sonic screwdriver acting as a laser with no explanation?
<prince-dari> Bullshit
<PinkiePie101> ....6_9
<prince-dari> [16:36] <Ictiv> prince-dari: Okay. Guess what? There are a bunch of people out there who think we are a satanist group for being Bronies. I'm not going to judge them on that but I also reserve the right to try and make them at least tolerate us They're can think that if they want
<Dken2021> they broke the "if it moves the plot" rule?
<prince-dari> I really couldn't care less tbh

<NewDCD> 09,01as you can see, Japanese Power Rangers, unlike American ones, are BOSS.
<Nittany_Discord> Why are we watching Power Rangers
<Nittany_Discord> when we can watch Invader Zim?
<NewDCD> 09,01the answer is...WHY THE FUCK NOT.
<Yellowquiet> because it s gay
<Nittany_Discord> But Power Rangers is something worse than me.
<Nittany_Discord> wat.
<diddutz> I found the source of that strange noise, its the bronystate-stream that appeared again!
<NewDCD> 09,01Power Rangers, yeah

<prince-dari> Shizuka: Yep, when you add those kinds of flavours to them they become like WKD
<KwakLad> and are you talking bacon flavoured vodka or vodka with bacon in it?
<prince-dari> It's vodka, but it tastes like a kid's drink
<Morty> NewDCD: are the other good robots dead?
<Fazana> It shall take long time to remove said privilages

<Fazana> 704 - Hargraive
<Kammerjunk> For some reason, I keep saying '17' when asked a question relative to numbers.
<YUUSHA-OH> I have shin here
*Gumri had no idea what Saturn meant
<Kammerjunk> I guess I just like the number '17'.
<Kammerjunk> It's a good number, though.
<Gumri> I say 7
<sonicrainboomer259> alli know is,he hugged me:)
*Gumri glomps sonicrainboomer259
<sonicrainboomer259> wht.....the...........hell
<Ingwaz|Laptop> perhaps 17 is the number of times you've had a severely mentally traumatizing event happen in your life and its your subconscious' way of trying to surpress the evens by making it seem as just a number that you regularly use so that you will not remember and have a complete mental breakdown?
<sonicrainboomer259> O___O
<Fazana> 702 - curse :s
<Morty> are all the good robots dead but Mic?
<Gumri> interesting theory. So i have had 7 of them
<sonicrainboomer259> too....many...words
<Kammerjunk> Ingwaz|Laptop: Good Goddesses!
<sonicrainboomer259> 17=ultimate android
<Fazana> 702 is my unlucky number, it almost got me killed :c

<GLaDOS> Im a pony.
<Yahooz> Yellowquiet: your math question from earlier... AB = 130 and AC = 122.4
<NewDCD> 09,01SUDDENLy.
<Gumri> Surprise buttseks
<sonicrainboomer259> did not want

<sonicrainboomer259> WAHA
<Fazana> Is he a marshmellow too?
<sonicrainboomer259> is it over, i'm bored
<alexxm> why are they telling this to a bunch of kids
<Yahooz> Yellowquiet: The difference between AB and AC is 7.6, and since AC is smaller, 2(AB) must equal 260, therefore AB = 130. 252.4-130 = AC = 122.4
<Yellowquiet> thx a lot Yahooz ^^
<Yahooz> no problem ^_^

<MahBoi777> TheDerpyBrony: it's a pastry
<KernelCobb> TheDerpyBrony don't mention it
<StinkomanFan> And you are rated on how brutally you off someone. You will never be used to seeing him take a pair of pliers and rip out part of someone's spine
<TheDerpyBrony> Oh :/

<Berry_From_Mars> They were around in 1970.
<LadyCanary> Only song I know by T-Rex is Teenage Dream.
<Moonlight> oh
<ScootaChicken> Marc Bolan is one of the most wonderfully flamboyant lead singers of all time
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary: inb4 people make Katy Perry connections
<CosmicLatte> Actually I'm just about to leave for dance, so I'm not sure why I bothered poking..

<ScootaChicken> I recommend The Who
<moop> AHHHHHHH THE FUCKING ILLUMINATI IS HERE!
<Berry_From_Mars> I haven't paid much attention to 60s bands recently...
<ScootaChicken> they're brilliant
<Berry_From_Mars> Er...
<Berry_From_Mars> I mean,
<Berry_From_Mars> Until now.
<Pegasister16> Just out of random curiosity, how long has this site been around?
<Athena> Mmm~ Loving this music I found~
<TheDr> i get a me gusta face when ever i hear the house theme :)\
<Moonlight> The who is good
<TopHat> hm...
<Moonlight> I don't listen to classic rock that much
<Berry_From_Mars> I do have one album by The Who, I haven't opened up to it very well though.
<Pegasister16> Hmm...
<Polydunami> Hella crazy
<Polydunami> <3
<moop> My dad has all of their albums
<ScootaChicken> The Who are one of my favourite bands of all time
<TopHat> I think since last may or something
<ben1994> spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Berry_From_Mars> I heard a cover of The Zombies' "She's Not There" And that got me interested in them.
<ScootaChicken> they're probably the best live band ever
<Moonlight> Queen is a great band
<TopHat> a long time
<Polydunami> Touche
<moop> QUEEN IS
<Berry_From_Mars> As for The yardbirds, I think Andy Partridge liked them so I'll check them out.
<TheDr> well i got to go do some mah chem work back in a bit guys
<The_4th_Wall> *pokes back anyway
<Midnight_Tempest> Freddy Mercury... you will be missed
<ScootaChicken> The Who's live performances were legendary for breaking world records in loudness
<ScootaChicken> Freddie Mercury was best tenor
<NewDCD> 09,01dat tear teeming with G-ENERGY

<Pegasister16> Thank you! :D
<NewDCD> 09,01also they romanize it as ZA POWA because there's a legendarily memetastic face of Gai going "SO THIS IS THE POWER OF THE POWER?!"
<Moonlight> I'm not even paying attention to the video
*TOY_PON32 throws magical powder dust on the ground
<Polydunami> Me neither
