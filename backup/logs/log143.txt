<CloudRunner> Sorry... I cant help you there...
<LordCelestia> and I wanna make like, a picture or something to help advertise it up on DA
<CloudRunner> Ive only been here for 2 weeks.
<LordCelestia> like something cool looking that helps promote BronyState
<ThePretender> hmmm
<LordCelestia> anyone?
<CloudRunner> Make a banner.
<SuperBrony64> LordCelestia: What did you need us to do?
<ThePretender> with a BronyState meme
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftvZFUg4HPc <-- I'm not sure what this is.
<LordCelestia> idk, gimme ideas or something
<ThePretender> like "Where was Gondor when we streamed MLP stuff?"
<LordCelestia> I don't think an inside joke will help advertise it much
<ThePretender> ...right.
<SuperBrony64> You could draw a picture of all the Mane6 sitting in a row at a movie theater doing unique stuff
<EspyLacopa> "Where was Luna when Discord returned?"
<Flaria> 16th Pinkie quest loop!
<ThePretender> haha, nice one Espy
*Flaria toots around the chat room
<CloudRunner> with presented by bronystate on the screen
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie Pie would have a lot of candy and popcorn stuffed into her hooves
<ThePretender> DAT TOOT
<LordCelestia> i like superbrony64s idea
<Flaria> EspyLacopa: It's Touhou, silly!
<SuperBrony64> Rarity would just simply use her magic to hold a cup of soda up while drinking it with a straw
<LordCelestia> isnt that pic already on bronystate front page
<CloudRunner> Pinkie with a mountian of popcorn and candy
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, I didn't even notice that
<CloudRunner> wait
<SuperBrony64> But not that kind
<CloudRunner> idk
<SuperBrony64> I mean like all of them sitting in a row facing the screen in a theater
<LordCelestia> I prob wouldnt just do the mane 6
<LordCelestia> But Ill brainstorm during school tomorrow so I can work on it when I get home
<LordCelestia> And i gotta go to bed now
<Flaria> Ask if you can get a screenshot of the big Bronystate logo that whoever made for opening the BMN
<SuperBrony64> But damn, I totally did not see the Rarity thing. I honestly just thought it up right now :P
<CloudRunner> night LordCelestia
<SuperBrony64> Okay, night LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> ^good idea flaria
<Flaria> Also, if ponies are sitting, definitely use Lyra. <3
<CloudRunner> lol neither did I.
*Flaria hugs LordCelestia
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<LordCelestia> be quite prince, theyre saying goodbye to me
<CloudRunner> DARI!!! <3

*LordCelestia hugs all goodbya
*LordCelestia disappears in a glorious handsome flash of light
<Flutterz> epic music galore
*ThePretender needs a signature exit.
<CloudRunner> This made my heart hurt and smile at the same time.
<CloudRunner> http://youtu.be/3gtwq6RM9Og
<Flaria> CloudRunner: That was a great comic. ;___;
<SuperBrony64> ThePretender: "And into the darkness I run away, without the knowledge of where to go, but only the memories of where I've been…"
<SuperBrony64> That'll be 5 bits.
<CloudRunner> SuperBrony64 That just made me all soul searchy.
<SuperBrony64> http://youtu.be/P97eyrXX7XA
<Flaria> I ran into the darkness, wandered around a bit, and ran out, and years had passed.
<Xerion> Do we need more pony?

<Flaria> inb4timewarpspam

<CloudRunner> does that get me into the herd?
<Flaria> EspyLacopa: Actually, I'm gonna wait until 11:30.

<Flaria> Goodbye, Dashite.
<SuperBrony64> Careful about prince-dari's bot
<CriticKitten> Post TOOT? Kay: http://tinyurl.com/3evjcng
<ThePretender> suddely, TOOTS everywhere!
<SuperBrony64> Thanks for the hug Flaria
<Flaria> :3
<Dashite> Dari's bot is usually set for 6 messages in 10 seconds so that grouping is good except for when Dari is around to boot me anyway. :p
<Dashite> I just need to be careful to wait 10 seconds to respond after I post it. >_>
<Flutterguy> .
<SuperBrony64> Don't think I didn't see what you did that day the room got '+m'ed.
<Dashite> ^
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Dashite> Wait, which day are we talking about? :p
<CloudRunner> Ok SuperBrony64 I just spent 3:25 of my life on that.
<SuperBrony64> THAT day.
<Nittany_Discord> Was someone playing Brodyquest/Pinkiequest just now?
<This_thing> ?
<SuperBrony64> CloudRunner: Fantastic! You're now in Tier 5.
<CloudRunner> oh god that day
<CloudRunner> What is best Tier and what is lowest?
<SuperBrony64> Tier 1 is highest
<Flaria> Nittany_Discord: I've been listening to it for the past hour.
<Dashite> Rainbow Dash Tier is highest, Fluttershy Tier is lowest
<CloudRunner> and lowest?
<Flutterguy> Uh.. tier?
<SuperBrony64> Tier 4 requires you to read Cupcakes and then simmer down with Simply Rarity.
<Dashite> Flutterguy *ponyshrug*
<SuperBrony64> Tier 5 is lowest
<CloudRunner> Dashite DID YOU JUST FUCKING IMPLY THAT FLUTTERSHY IS LOW TIER!?
*Flutterguy hasn't the slightest idea what these crazy ponies are speaking of.
<Dashite> CloudRunner, I didn't imply anything.
<Flaria> SuperBrony64: What do tier 3, 2 and 1 require?
<CloudRunner> your an ass
<CloudRunner> lol
<ThePretender> All the ponies in this chat are crazy!
<Flutterguy> ^
<Dashite> What about my ass now?
<SuperBrony64> Tier 3 requires (after completing Tiers 4 and 5) you to chat here at least 2 hours a day for a week.
<CloudRunner> It is large and smells of peches
<SuperBrony64> They will be judged based on your performance. You then get reviewed and approved for Tier 3.
<CloudRunner> Peaches*
<Flaria> 2 and 1?
<Dashite> Now I'm curious about how you came to that conclusion, but I'm not entirely sure I want to know.
<CloudRunner> SuperBrony64 are these tiers based on anything or are they being pulled out of your flank?
<Dashite> The latter.
<Flaria> Latter, but I'm curious.
<SuperBrony64> Tier 2 requires attending BronyState Movie Nights AT LEAST four times in a row and staying through them from the time the first movie starts till the start of the post-show.
<ctrlx> who wants to see my haircut?
<CloudRunner> Dashite all of the Mane 6 are high tier. none are low tier.
<Dashite> I disagree, but I'll leave it at that. :)
<CloudRunner> I like this guy ^
<CloudRunner> Gummy is god tier btw. http://youtu.be/CyVTiztgmYA
<Flaria> And tier one?
<SuperBrony64> Tier 1, which I don't believe is attainable yet, requires you to be here for 80% of all the Brony Movie nights (or equivalent weekly special events) for an entire year.
<Dashite> Oh, I'll definitely agree with your about Gummy though.
<SuperBrony64> At least 80%
<Dashite> 80%? There are a number of people that have been here for that many.
<ctrlx> what's going on?
<Dashite> Dermathil is one of them.
<ThePretender> DAT SKYRIM SONG
<SuperBrony64> Over a year's time?
<Flaria> Sweet, I'm 'tier 2'
*Flaria dances with fire
<Dashite> Oh, misread that.
<Dermathil> uh?
<Dermathil> I'm one of what Dashite?
<Dashite> Been here for 80%+ of BMNs
<Dermathil> oh right. I'm Tier 1 I guess
<SuperBrony64> If there are about 48 fridays in a year, then you need to be to AT LEAST 38 of them. (not including nor requiring encore presentations)
<Dashite> Except he said over the course of a year.
<CloudRunner> We need a new Tier system that doesnt require the reading of Cupcakes
<ThePretender> agreed
<SuperBrony64> CloudRunner: Work in progress on that one.
<ThePretender> cause I'd be like...Tier 3 or 2
<Dermathil> SuperBrony64: Been on since Movie night #2, and since then I been on almost EVERY DAY, even during off-movie days.
<Dashite> It should require reading all of Fallout: Equestria. DEDICATION PEOPLE!
<Flutterguy> Quick question.. when did movie nights start?
<CloudRunner> Also one that doesnt require the knowing of a (very specific) website.
<Dermathil> Flutterguy: May
<ThePretender> or the Vinyl Scratch Tables
<Flaria> Your faces when I've been listening to Pinkiequest for hour and a half
<Dashite> May 13th was the first day
<Dermathil> Dashite: I'm up to date with the fic
<ctrlx> guys
<ctrlx> i don't know D:
<Dermathil> Dashite: that means I first showed up on May 20th
<SuperBrony64> Tier 5 is going to be attending just one Brony Movie night
<Flaria> SuperBrony64: I'd say 3 months of constant watching and participation in chat, in addition to contributing to the community
<Flutterguy> ctrlx Know what?
<CloudRunner> I personaly try to avoid fics so I dont accidentaly head canon something
<ctrlx> what's going on
<Flutterguy> I don't either dude.
*Flutterguy shrugs. But he understands what they're talking about.
<Dermathil> anyways, GOOD NIGHT EVERYBRONY!!!!!
<Dashite> Dermathil, Monty Python/Evil Dead was night 2. Good time to show up. :D
<Flaria> I've had pinkiequest on loop for an hour and a half
<Flutterguy> Bye then Dermathil!
*Flaria hugs Dermathil goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<ThePretender> later Dermathil!
<CloudRunner> Good night Dermathil
<SuperBrony64> Night Dermathil
<CloudRunner> http://youtu.be/iyC2ccF_-Pc

<Flaria> I'mma stop the Pinkiequest loop at 30 loops.
<Flaria> One more loop~
*Xerion passes out from lurking so hard
<Flutterguy> One more turns to two, Flaria..
<Flaria> Nah.
<Flaria> 30 is a good stopping point.
<CloudRunner> Tier 2 (alt) Visit Equestria Daily, daily for a few months
<Flaria> (yay! I've done that :3)
<Dashite> I've done that, but I didn't qualify for Tier 3. >_>
<Flaria> Last loop~
<CloudRunner> Tier 1 Memorize every single line in every episode AND recrute 15+ Bronies
<Flaria> I'm sticking to tier two. >_>
<CloudRunner> Tier 1 (alt) Recrute 40+ Bronies and memorize every song
<Flaria> Well, I've memorized every song.
<CloudRunner> God Tier Create a Pony related website that updates daily.
*Flaria shrugs
<Flaria> God Tier IMO is just be recognized across the community.
<Flaria> Seth, Cereal, iBringDaLulz, PinkiePieSwear, ect
<Flaria> Whoops. Went to 31 loops.
<Flaria> Anyway, that's closed
<CloudRunner> I made it to tier 3. I would be at Tier 1 but only 4 recrutes...
<CloudRunner> God Tier (alt) what Flaria said
<Flaria> <3
<CloudRunner> although I dont recognise iBringDaLulz
<Flaria> I'd like to be recognized for the cursors, but I have a lot of work before I'm telling anyone.

<Luna> 07,1...grr
<Luna> 07,1..3 more weeks!
<Luna> 07,1and Sam 3 is out!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You really should add a 0 to your color script :P
<Luna> 07,1yep
<Turgle> lol
<SomeBrony> Sam 3… S2E3…
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish I could play Sam 3 on this computer, after watching that trailer you linked me to a couple of weeks ago
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sadly, I very much doubt it's possible :(
<Luna> 07,01123456
<Luna> 07,01789010
<Luna> 07,0101
<Luna> 07,01fixed

<Luna> 07,01hey FlaschenJoe11
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My mom has a lot of SQL background, so I can't really impress her easily with scripts :P
<DashWithRainbows> guys, what is better mIRC or mibbit?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Define "better" :P
<DashWithRainbows> hmmm, use as a portable perhaps?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You'll get less delay with mIRC, but you won't really notice it much in Mibbit
<DashWithRainbows> e.g. on a flash drive
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, err, mIRC then, I don't know how you'd put the Mibbit chat on a flash drive
<DashWithRainbows> alright, im going to install it now
<Turgle> rofl
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well I guess I know, but it doesn't sound like a good plan.
<Luna> 07,01mIRC
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Cloud riding on Fashion Style Rarity instead of his motorcycle... like a baws!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Going to stream your Serious Sammage, Luna?

<RobotPinkie> 06,15That would be fun to watch
*Diftraku crash in through the roof
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Congratulations Diftraku, you're the new Rainbow Crash
<Diftraku> I better be
<Diftraku> I got out of the last class at 15:30

<RobotPinkie> 06,15New classes start for me on the 10th next month...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15CR?
<Diftraku> I get to Kamppi and notice the 812 isn't running anymore
<Diftraku> So 813 leaves at 15:53
<Diftraku> I get myself an icecream and then get to the bus
<Diftraku> 45 minutes later we're outside of Helsinki, heading to Porvoo on the highway
<Diftraku> The bus was 10 minutes late due to traffic
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Gotta catch your bus, you see your friiiieeeends
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ouch, that's a long ride
<Diftraku> I eventually get to Porvoo, then world bucks me in the arse and the bus I could've taken went 5 minutes ago
<Diftraku> I wait another 10 minutes there and then take the bus to home, walk home, slump to the chair and turn the computer on
<Diftraku> I open Winamp, I put the speakers on and put Makkon befriends Jeffthestrider - Impressions of Celestia Origins
<Diftraku> playing
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and now it's pony time, amirite or amirite?
<Diftraku> I shall now execute the "I don't give a buck about the world"-evening right now
<Diftraku> I'm half-dead after the day...

<AllisZero> Lolo

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'll probably upload in a bit, if I don't fall asleep
<AllisZero> I'm super tired myself
<AllisZero> Not being able to sleep the past few days
<AllisZero> Well, rather, past few MONTHS really but been worse this week

<RobotPinkie> 06,15brb, rebootan
<AllisZero> Wow, we love fine sure isn't pulling any punches
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I know... they've got way too many pony shirts I want.

<Luna> 07,01http://www.iaza.com/work/110927C/iaza14289689152200.png
<Luna> 07,01Sooooo cute!
<MeteorVenture> wait.. is that last one pony related?
<MeteorVenture> not sure where to save it is all
<Luna> 07,01it's pinkiepie
<MeteorVenture> alright well there's little actual indication of that lol

<MeteorVenture> alright though thanks
<Luna> 07,01here http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/270/5/1/pinkitty_pie_by_rizusaur-d4b4s9i.png

<Luna> 07,01and lastly http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/270/a/c/fluffershy_by_rizusaur-d4b44og.png
<Trollestia> This is a fine piece of work. http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&v=nZAGpJr5RsU
<Turgle> twilight cat is best cat
<Luna> 07,01She looks awesome, yes
<MeteorVenture> i was thinking that i kinda wish the cats reflected the chars personality better.. but i'm not sure how that would really happen
<MeteorVenture> cause they're actually pretty good
<AllisZero> Yeah, those look nice
<AllisZero> So since I submitted it a few days ago already I guess it's okay to ask for opinions
<AllisZero> Any suggestions to make it better? http://www.kidoutenshi.net/random/Disregard_Chaos.jpg
<AllisZero> 'twas my submission to the Welovefine contest :p
<Luna> 07,01a little more details i'd say
<Turgle> that's good :D
<Luna> 07,01or maybe a different color for either the cloud or Pinkie
<AllisZero> Yeah, they need a little more contrast
<AllisZero> So does Chocolate
<Luna> 07,01yes
<AllisZero> Working on a white background makes everything pop out differently
<AllisZero> As far as more details, what do you mean?
<Luna> 07,01Well like I said Pinkie needs more contrast and the straw maybe at a glass of choco-rain?
<AllisZero> That could work too
<Rainbow-Dash> Wat
<Rainbow-Dash> Dairies?
<Rainbow-Dash> Dat typo
<AllisZero> oh god mare milk
<prince-dari> Mare milk...?
<Rainbow-Dash> Tell us more AllisZero
<Rainbow-Dash> I am enthralled..
<Rainbow-Dash> :P
<Rainbow-Dash> Also, Prince-Dari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIjNbOsdPio
<prince-dari> O_o
<Rainbow-Dash> Its a glitch
<DashWithRainbows> the fuck as it reminded me of CoD
<prince-dari> Yeah, so I gathered.
<Rainbow-Dash> When I saw it, I had a stupid grin on my face, and my first thought was: Problem, Beta testers?
<Diftraku> lol
*Trollestia sings along to the trololo.

<Dermathil> indeed
<Diftraku> I guess he didn't want to get... *sunglasses* Philosophical
<Dermathil> he's also the teacher that allows us to leave the earliest too
<Rainbow-Dash> Its probably to late AllisZero
<Dermathil> (once he allowed us to leave the 2-hour long class after only 40 minutes because he was done with what he had to teach us in that class)
<Rainbow-Dash> But dont forget to take your medicine while your at it
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol

<Kitten> so i'm noticing.. thats why momma calls every 2- 3 days, she plans to call today and tell them that she isn't going to be paying for the last week since we havent really had internet and its not right paying for something that she is supposed to be getting but is not getting
*Kitten cuddles Ari and Jason

<Kitten> Illinois Consolidated
<Diftraku> They had to close the old thread because it was too laggy for mods
<Jason> whats that?
<Diftraku> How laggy, you ask: 10 to 15 seconds per page
<MeteorVenture> D:
<MeteorVenture> i really really wanted to see how far it goes
<Kitten> lol my service provider :P
<DashWithRainbows> woah...
<Jason> oh
<DashWithRainbows> thats alot of pages
<Jason> I have rogers
<Diftraku> Vbulletin experts said you should close them at 10k posts
<Jason> aka ATT
<MeteorVenture> >implying they ever get that far ever
<Diftraku> http://i52.tinypic.com/n53gut.png is a proper reaction
<Diftraku> I even shot an e-mail to EqD about it :P
<DashWithRainbows> nice image Diftraku, hopefully we will take over the world
<MeteorVenture> we will have the biggest thread on the official forums of earth
<Kitten> cool
<SuperBrony64> Good morning everypony!
<DashWithRainbows> hey SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> What's up DashWithRainbows?
<DashWithRainbows> nothing much, had trouble connecting to this chat with mIRC,
<SuperBrony64> Ouch, what's the problem?
<DashWithRainbows> it's fixed now - the problem was i didnt know what to do
<SuperBrony64> Haha, that's a common problem with many things...
<DashWithRainbows> i just done random things and then it connected me
<DashWithRainbows> so i retraced steps, found out how i did it and thats it really
<SuperBrony64> That's good!
<SuperBrony64> I presume we're the only ones active here right now?
<DashWithRainbows> i think so, chat has been dying alot
<DashWithRainbows> but more people will be on i guess
<SuperBrony64> Not really an ideal day to chat lol
<DashWithRainbows> just wait till later, thats what i usually do.
<DashWithRainbows> around 9pm is when chat is alive for me
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, gets active more around evening time.
<DashWithRainbows> im going to try and see if the portable mIRC will work on my school computers (hope it does)
<SuperBrony64> I have a class and a lab today :/
<DashWithRainbows> i have to do 6 lessons per day, each 50 minutes each
<SuperBrony64> It should, but if not you could use the online IRC clients.
<DashWithRainbows> everyday i only do maximum of 3 lesson's
<SuperBrony64> Unless you are at a public school that filters content...
<SuperBrony64> Why only 3/6?
<DashWithRainbows> >my school always filters no matter what
<DashWithRainbows> yep
<DashWithRainbows> monday - 2 lessons then 4 lessons doing what i want
<DashWithRainbows> tuesday the same
<SuperBrony64> They might filter out the IRC server
<DashWithRainbows> wednesday 3 lessons
<DashWithRainbows> thursday - same as wednesday
<SuperBrony64> Unless you're the first to use it at your school, then you've got some time before they do that :P
<DashWithRainbows> friday - 2 lessons
<DashWithRainbows> 1st to use bronystate, able to use chat on that
<DashWithRainbows> but it takes ages to connect
<SuperBrony64> I hate public school internet
<DashWithRainbows> school has banned the nightly round-up for me on EQD but rest of site is ok
<SuperBrony64> I used to have that problem when I was back in high school
<SuperBrony64> But a quick proxy server was the cure :P
<SuperBrony64> Well…it wasn't 'quick' but it WORKED
<DashWithRainbows> the "mods" as we call them in our school, ban anything innapropiate in a matter of around 30mins
<SuperBrony64> Jerks haha
<DashWithRainbows> but they have not banned any pony sites for me, only some of the external links e.g. youtube, deviantart
<SuperBrony64> Do you happen to know what internet filter they are using?
<DashWithRainbows> embc i think
<DashWithRainbows> i dont remember
<SuperBrony64> Have you tried using a proxy server?
<DashWithRainbows> nope
<DashWithRainbows> might try
<DashWithRainbows> but they act fast
<SuperBrony64> I don't think they can do anything with a proxy server
<DashWithRainbows> e.g. one of my friends went onto command prompt to shut down his friends computer from across the room
<SuperBrony64> It reroutes the connection past their filters
<DashWithRainbows> mods came in around 1 minute after he accessed it
<SuperBrony64> Haha wow
<DashWithRainbows> had his account suspended for about 3 days
<SuperBrony64> What kind of school is this?!
<DashWithRainbows> this is kettering buccleuch academy
<DashWithRainbows> its fucking shit
<SuperBrony64> Oh damn
<DashWithRainbows> only good thing about it is that it is a sports academy
<DashWithRainbows> so the course i chose gets good equipment and also gets to try the new laptops 1st for the whole year
<AllisZero> Alright, I'm back
<SuperBrony64> That's not bad.
<SuperBrony64> Hey AllisZero
<DashWithRainbows> hey AllisZero
<SuperBrony64> I hope that the academy isn't your only source for internet access.
<AllisZero> SuperBrony64: They can't do anything with a Proxy server besides block that IP address
<SuperBrony64> Yeah.
<AllisZero> And if it's a school they're usually on the ball with that, so they just might block that IP altogether
<AllisZero> Unless you use an inconspicuous port for your proxy
<SuperBrony64> Just keep a list of proxies handy haha
<AllisZero> (which I should be doing with mine at work, but I've been too lazy to)
<SuperBrony64> My school used a primitive filtering system so proxy servers were VERY popular.
<DashWithRainbows> of course it isnt the only source for internet -_- im at home
<SuperBrony64> That's good, didn't know if this was the kind of school you lived at during the school year :P
<SuperBrony64> A spy…?
<VampirePrincess> hello?
<DashWithRainbows> thats classified.
<Dusky> Am not!
<Dusky> Err...
<Dusky> >_>
<Dusky> <_<
<SuperBrony64> HE REVEALED HIMSELF!
<Dusky> As you were
<DashWithRainbows> worst spy ever
<SuperBrony64> WHOSE FOOTPRINTS ARE THESE?!
<SuperBrony64> !
<DashWithRainbow> just checking the non-portable mIRC is connected okay.
<SuperBrony64> Do you have a smart phone DashWithRainbows?
<DashWithRainbows> no
<DashWithRainbows> i put the portable onto a flash drive
<SuperBrony64> Ok, was going to suggest using that.
<DashWithRainbows> so i can use at school, (flash drive also has my backup pony folders)
<DashWithRainbows> which i need to update now
<SuperBrony64> A new challenger has appeared!
<SuperBrony64> Hey Luna
<Luna> 07,01ello
<DashWithRainbows> ohai Luna
*AllisZero hugs Luna
<AllisZero> Wb
<SuperBrony64> But yeah, having that much security on the internet at your school must not be fun :/
<DashWithRainbows> it isnt, that why i need my personal laptop so i can install C&C on it
<SuperBrony64> I LOATHED my school's internet.
<DashWithRainbows> and play when i have free lessons (18/30 per week)
<SuperBrony64> Le horror...
<Spyrorocks> Jason, rogers is AT&T?
<MrChang> is it house time? :D
<VioletVanilla> 06Soon~
<MrChang> YAY
<VioletVanilla> 06DashWithRaibows you play C&C? Which ones?
<DashWithRainbows> i usually play Generals and Zero hour
<DashWithRainbows> as they are the best ones IMO
<Luna> 07,01well soon in 2hrs and 15 mins
<DashWithRainbows> basically 9pm for uk
<Luna> 07,01correct
<DashWithRainbows> around 4pm in some usa i guess
<DashWithRainbows> or 3pm
<Dusky> *squee* Octavia is best pony
<VioletVanilla> 06but it's 7:45PM right now. . . 2 hours and 15 minutes would be 10PM . . . x.x
*Luna hugs Violet
<VioletVanilla> 06Dashie~ We should play Generals together~ c;
*Dusky hugs Octavia
*VioletVanilla hugs Luna back gently~
*Luna hugs Octavia too
*VioletVanilla hugs Octavia as well
<DashWithRainbows> if i could connect online, the copy i brought does not allow me to play online oddly enough, says invalid code
<VioletVanilla> 06Have you Hamachi? ;3
<DashWithRainbows> used to
<DashWithRainbows> got rid of it i think
<DashWithRainbows> let me check my folders
<Luna> 07,01luckily it's easy to reinstall ^^
<Rainbow-Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnkBMMLv2l4&feature=related
<DashWithRainbows> nope, i got rid of it. i think it was when i stopped playing minecraft
<VioletVanilla> 06Get it again
<VioletVanilla> 06and we could potentially play over network
<Rainbow-Dash> Generals?
<Rainbow-Dash> Whats that?
<DashWithRainbows> it was mad around 2003
<DashWithRainbows> it was the 1st command and conquer that was 3-d graphics and was known as one of the best C&C games that EA made
<Rainbow-Dash> Sounds fun
<Rainbow-Dash> Do either of you have Terraria?
<DashWithRainbows> nope.
<VampirePrincess> bbl
<Rainbow-Dash> Aw, thats a shame :P
<DashWithRainbows> i was thinking of getting it and i played it a few times round my friends house, i just didnt like it
<Rainbow-Dash> How long did you play it?
<DashWithRainbows> well i usually stay round his for about 4 hours... and he plays his other computer upstairs so we both play
<DashWithRainbows> all in all i say about 18 hours i played it
<Rainbow-Dash> Wow
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<DashWithRainbows> turns out i still have hamachi, but needs updating
<VioletVanilla> 06I saw you said the best C&C game and was about to explode but then I see you added by EA. . .
<VioletVanilla> 06That is true.
<VioletVanilla> 06^.^
<VioletVanilla> 06Westwood made amazing C&C games~
<DashWithRainbows> yep
<DashWithRainbows> i didnt mind tiberium wars 3 much
<VioletVanilla> 06tiberium Wars was delicious~
<VioletVanilla> 06The Ion Cannon made that game for me~ <3
<DashWithRainbows> for me, mammoth tank is best tank
<VioletVanilla> 06Mammy! ^-^
<DashWithRainbows> i liked how they included the Scrin faction in TW3
<Dashite> I liked how Nod and GDI barely paused in fighting each other when the aliens came in and started trying to kill everyone.
<DashWithRainbows> i loved seeing my little soldiers try to hold off the tripods and sometimes won
<MeteorVenture> my little soldiers i used to wonder what war could be
<MeteorVenture> until you all shot your bullets at me
<Dashite> Doesn't quite fit the syllables, but...
<Dashite> A big ass tank, crushing infantry...
<MeteorVenture> (i should have said warfare instead)
<VioletVanilla> 06Dashite told me we would play. . .
<VioletVanilla> 06but that was a month ago. . x.x
<Dashite> >_>
<Dashite> <_<
*Dashite heads off to class

<LordCelestia> Guys, watch this video real fast. I used the timestamp to make it start at the point of the vi im trying to show you. THIS SONG has been stuck in my head ALL day today. It's the song that should play as soon as you cliock this link
<LordCelestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK9nTmt1pWQ#t=35m55s
<LordCelestia> ^ So epic.
<LordCelestia> Anybody else talking?

<AllisZero> watched it
<LordCelestia> ah
<AllisZero> didnt see much difference
<AllisZero> but again I only watched each episode once so far
<LordCelestia> Well if that didnt cheer you up then i don't know what to do
<LordCelestia> ^Yeah, but the music was awesome and stuff.
<Luna> 07,01this: i've watched about 20mins of this and while i give you an A for effort in making a more "serious version" of the cartoon. you weren't able to execute it as well as i'd liked. as it has already been said the music over powers the speech quite abit, the video color is off(i'm a video editor myself and i don't buy the "youtube screwed it up" line when i could fix an issue like that
<Luna> 7,1in 20mins and reupload),and alot of the music score seems out of place as in doesn't﻿ fit the scene. good effort though
<Luna> 07,01is pretty much how I feel about it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, I just wish it did more than change the music/color
<LordCelestia> ^Isn't that one of the comments?
<Luna> 07,01eeeyup
<Diftraku> Wb Dusky
<Luna> 07,01that's why I said this: :P
<LordCelestia> And yeah, the whole thing was a little disappointing for me. I just think the last part was good.
<LordCelestia> I thought it would be more epic
<Luna> 07,01I just cried...
<Luna> 07,01http://i.imgur.com/kgXwv.jpg
<Luna> 07,01:(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah I saw that one
<DashWithRainbows> that me cry aswell Luna
<Luna> 07,01god...
<MeteorVenture> so what are we to believe? that it's just pinkie pie being pinkie pie or that?
<Luna> 07,01It's not that well drawn.. but the story... so sad
<LordCelestia> who was the pony who became sick?
<MeteorVenture> well the style was fine but the expressions were confusing
<AllisZero> Probably just a random friend
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I choose to think of my Equestria as Cancer free :P
<MeteorVenture> free cancer? where?
<AllisZero> Better stock up while you can
*LordCelestia beats the crao out of sickness before it reaches Equestria
<AllisZero> I was thinking about this today while having breakfast
<Turgle> luna that's SO sad
<Luna> 07,01I know...
<AllisZero> How there's no real "evil" in equestria
<Rainbow-Dash> Luna
<Rainbow-Dash> We are going to take Equestria
<AllisZero> For example, the villains aren't exactly violent
<Rainbow-Dash> AND PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
<MeteorVenture> resident evil: equestria
<LordCelestia> Well it IS a kids show don't forget
<AllisZero> But I think that's not entirely accurate if you take the Hydra trying to eat ponies into consideration
<AllisZero> Yeah, that too :p
<MeteorVenture> wouldn't it be fun to have celestia chasing you with a rocket launcher?
<LordCelestia> Im sure if it were a real place, they would get sick and die just like humans do
<LordCelestia> and there could be violence
<LordCelestia> and what not
<Rainbow-Dash> Its not a good thought though LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> Yeah, i know
<MeteorVenture> and good thoughts are good and bad thoughts are bad
<AllisZero> Fun things are fun
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I love fun things
<LordCelestia> Id rather read a fic where the ponies kisk ass and save the world
<LordCelestia> than a fic where its sad when someone dies
<MeteorVenture> kiss or kick?
<LordCelestia> then again, wouldnt anyone?
<DashWithRainbows> kick
<LordCelestia> *kick
<LordCelestia> not kiss
<DashWithRainbows> comedy fics are my favourite
<LordCelestia> That might be why I notice small details like how they put orchestra in the background when they were defeating Discord, and thought it was epic. :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so, is there any possibility of Thundercats today? :3
<MeteorVenture> i'd rather read a fic where friends are just friends doing friendly things.. that's what an accurate fic would be like
<LordCelestia> Oh and has anyone noticed how RIGHT before they stone-ify him, Twilight says "There's no doubt it's worth fighting for!" and MAYBE, that's the creators throwing that in as a reference to the "PonyCraft 2" video, which earned a LOT of fans to the show?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eh, I think that's just a coincidence
<MeteorVenture> what do we want? A GIRL WORTH FIGHTING FOR!
<LordCelestia> I dunno
<LordCelestia> the show HAS been altered due to brony fandom before
<MeteorVenture> to be friends with ofc
<LordCelestia> just look at Derpy becoming a mail carrier, and being crosseyed on purpose? that was all Lauren Faust
<LordCelestia> that was cause of bronies, too
<Flutterz> The target audience has simply shifted to us
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, but that's basically the only example
<MeteorVenture> mail carrier is coincidence.. derped eyes is intentional
<LordCelestia> Whatever the case is, it was fun hearing twilight say it.
<AllisZero> If the target audience shifts to bronies
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think we're looking WAY too much into it
<AllisZero> The show will become a disaster.
<LordCelestia> No, mail carrier is what people called derpy
<Flutterz> Not officially though
<Flutterz> WE NEED TO THINK DEEPER
<FlaschenJoe11> I want an episode featuring Doctor Whooves (with Derpy)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Mail Mare is what we gave her, what they put on the show is a mare who helps move large items
<LordCelestia> faust even admitted that she knew about the derpy mail thing. it was probably her shoutout to us
<MeteorVenture> but they animated the scene first.. then they went back and changed the eyes.. if you're talking about episode 15 and such (i think that was the one anyway)
<AllisZero> I think it's cool they make references to us here and there but if the show starts catering too much to the adult fandom it's gonna lose everything
<MeteorVenture> i am pretty dang sure..
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yay stream!
<FlaschenJoe11> STREA
<Flutterz> lol wowhead.com :D
<LordCelestia> ^ i know
<ValtheJean> 2,14 derpy's existence is a nod to us, yes. But other than that they aren't throwing things in for bronies everywhere
<FlaschenJoe11> STREAM!!
<FlaschenJoe11> yay~
<LordCelestia> Yeah, i expected nothing more though
<Flutterz> someone likes to play wow ;)
<Luna> 07,01how did you notice so quick :o
<WhatPayne> Hm stream?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I had page open, lawl
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Luna: the stream now automatically updates
<Flutterz> I heard the sound
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so when the stream starts, everyone hears it
<FlaschenJoe11> bam It's there Luna
<WhatPayne> Same here RobotPinkie. Constantly loading
<FlaschenJoe11> it changed instantly
<MeteorVenture> i think the thing people don't exactly realize is that they ALWAYS had those references around.. unless we were reading too much into that as well (i doubt it)
<Flutterz> I'm pretty sure if you click play on the stream, it automatically loads anything that appears
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the only thing they altered was derpy's appearance. The episode still had a pony drop stuff on Twilight, just they changed it to derpy for the bronies
<ValtheJean> 2,14 everything else is just us drawing way too much
<MeteorVenture> not to mention that they know what they're doing and wouldn't be so dumb as to change everything
<Flutterz> moar musics
<Turgle> awesome!
<LordCelestia> I know, but one or two shoutouts here and there would be really funny!
<FlaschenJoe11> Derpy is a friend of the finer things in Life (she was at Fluttershy's model appearance
<FlaschenJoe11> HOUSE!
<Flutterz> woot House :D
<Turgle> they extracted the soundtrack from the episode!
<Flutterz> Too bad the recent seasons have been getting progressively worse...
<MeteorVenture> a few shoutouts here and there is perfectly fine.. but the show hasn't changed cause of it
<MeteorVenture> most shows make references and tack the show onto them.. MLP makes the show and tacks references onto it
<Flutterz> who was on the photo, Luna? ;)
<Flutterz> ah, I think I remember this one
<Luna> 07,01what photo?
<Flutterz> your profile pic
<ValtheJean> 2,14 is anyone else getting stutters?
<Luna> 07,01yea am working on it
<Flutterz> was ujust about to ask if im the only one getting hiccups
<ValtheJean> 2,14 roger that
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ah okay.
<Sumica> lo all
<AllisZero> I am but that's normal, so not even jelly
<FlaschenJoe11> kid will be the patient, in house-verse a bloody nose means you're as good as dead
<VioletVanilla> 06Roger that let me try it with another film
<VioletVanilla> 06LIFE IS A BOX OF CHOCOLATES
<VioletVanilla> 06ANDMY NAME IS FOREST GUMP
<Flutterz> THIS IS THE TALE
<VioletVanilla> 06I AM NOT THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED
<Flutterz> OF CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW
<VioletVanilla> 06BUT IA GIVE GINNY ALL MY LOVE
<RobotPinkie> 06,15THIS WHOLE TOWN'S A PONY
<FlaschenJoe11> hey sumi Violet
<Flutterz> NOW BACK TO THE GOOD PART
<RobotPinkie> 06,15JUST WAITING TO GET... i dunno
<VioletVanilla> 06Hallo Flaschen~
<VioletVanilla> 06WAITING TO GET BUUUUCKED
<VioletVanilla> 06;D
<Flutterz> EPIC
<Flutterz> :D
<LordCelestia> This song has been in he head all day as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nff3Bj09glk
<Flutterz> THIS WHOLE TOWN'S A TREE
<Flutterz> WAITING TO GET BUUUUCKED
<FlaschenJoe11> I'm sure Fluttershy` would like being a tree
<Flutterz> lol
<FlaschenJoe11> but not getting bucked
<Flutterz> yeah, that'd hurt
<Turgle> LordCelestia, that OST is awesome
<Sumica> we on a backup again?
<LordCelestia> It is. suprising thing is, i originally found it in a brony video, but i recognized the sheer epicness from the movie
<WhatPayne> Is the stream up atm?
<Flutterz> dont think so
<FlaschenJoe11> One of the things the Bayformers had running for them was good music
<Flutterz> I'm willing to bet that a lot of the music was simply from Immediate Music
<Turgle> probably
<LordCelestia> i literally almost cried in sheer awesomeness when they used it during the battle in the movie. it was THAT good.
<Flutterz> so nothing the Bayformers really deserve credit for
<Turgle> i don't have watched Transformers 3 yet :I
<LordCelestia> you need to watch it
<Flutterz> I haven't watched any of the 3
<Flutterz> and I plan to keep it that way
<FlaschenJoe11> I don't give them the credit for them. Just say it worked good to use them
<LordCelestia> watch 3, forget 1 and 2
<Turgle> i will
<LordCelestia> lol
<FlaschenJoe11> accept 1 Erase 2 and watch 3
<AllisZero> That song is amazing, LC
<LordCelestia> I KNOW RIGHT!?
<Flutterz> then purchase brain bleach, AMIRITE?
<LordCelestia> Thats why I posted that other video twice earlier. It just made the whole thing 50 times cooler
<FlaschenJoe11> For that you would have to nuke your brain
<Flutterz> I really wish you could make backups of your brain
<Flutterz> that would be so awesome
<AllisZero> Soon
<Turgle> indeed
<Flutterz> and then I could forget ever reading Cupcakes...
*Flutterz shudders
<FlaschenJoe11> 2 is an Eldritch Abomination
<Turgle> so true
<Turgle> it's terrible
<LordCelestia> or make an epic alternate ending where RBD breaks free right before the evildoer begins and kicks her ass
<Turgle> xD
<Flutterz> it's really well done, but it's insanely disturbing
<LordCelestia> or royal guards storm the basement. either one
<FlaschenJoe11> Just read this http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/story-light-in-darkness.html Flutterz, it's the ANTI-Cupcakes
<Flutterz> there are about 20 alternate endings
<LordCelestia> i read one where Applejack broke into the room and saved her last minute
<LordCelestia> but killed pinkie with a self-defensive kick
<FlaschenJoe11> read that one LC
<FlaschenJoe11> the sequel to that is kinda sweet
<LordCelestia> Yeah, its pretty sweet
<Turgle> UH!
<Turgle> suggest awesome stories i have to read
<Flutterz> FlaschenJoe11, yeah, there's a couple of comics like that
<FlaschenJoe11> FLUTTERZ! THIS IS GOD! READ "THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS"! IT WILL HEAL YOUR SOUL!!
<FlaschenJoe11> No seriously it's awesome READ IT!
<Flutterz> I will
<Flutterz> but later
<LordCelestia> im reading it now
<FlaschenJoe11> or now. since the stream isn't up yet
<Flutterz> But I still doubt it will make me forget what I read
<Flutterz> Wait, why am I listening to God if I don't believe in him? o_O
<FlaschenJoe11> it won't make you forget. It helps you get over it
<Turgle> good stories to suggest?
<Turgle> anyone?
<Flutterz> Once Bitten Twice Shy
<Flutterz> TwiShy shipping tho
<FlaschenJoe11> Also GOD was myself! since God isn't spelled "ALL CAPS!"
<Flutterz> I've been fooled!
<FlaschenJoe11> THAT would have been LORD
<Flutterz> IMPOSSIBRU
<Rainbow-Dash> VioletVanilla, I just scrolled up and saw what you said
<Rainbow-Dash> What are you smoking?
<FlaschenJoe11> I love technically loopholes
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Sumica> She was quoting a song Rainbow-Dash
<Rainbow-Dash> Oh, it just looked like a rather threatening burst of energy to me
<Rainbow-Dash> :P
<VioletVanilla> 06Everypony calm down~ ;3
<Sumica> I forget what it was called but it started out as a pirates song and started geting random.

<NewDCD> 9October last year had them revealing they were working on the Autovajin
<Fateful_Gem> 6_9
<NewDCD> 9"The next bike in planning is the Auto-Vajin. It'll replicate the detail as seen in the TV series, and of course, will include the transformation gimmick. However, this is the first prototype, and there is still a long road to go 'til its actual release."
<Dermathil> its a tumor
<NewDCD> 9So the thing is: it's not released yet.
<Fateful_Gem> :O
<Flutterz> or a tumor

<CriticKitten> House is such an awesome troll.

<NewDCD> 9>mfw it was in Orlando, and is supposed to be heading for Doral
<FlaschenJoe11> Boy is creepy
<NewDCD> 9>mfw it hasn't arrived yet
<Flutterz> that in Win7 you can control the volume of different applications
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Did you order something cool, NewDCD?
<Flutterz> including browsers
<FlaschenJoe11> VERY CREEPY!

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nice kid.
*FlaschenJoe11 looks into upper right corner
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie: Shin Ichigo. Estimated delivery date for it is Friday-Saturday...to my P.O. Box in Doral. After that, I gotta wait for the shipping service I'm subscribed to bring it here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 the BOY was being abused :P
<CriticKitten> Were I Cameron, I'd be all "dude, you're like a young Bieber, gtfo"
<FlaschenJoe11> I would never do something like that
<Flutterz> rofl Critic
<NewDCD> 9 Had to choose free shipping because I have to pay like 3-6 bucks to the local shipping service
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nice, NewDCD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's naught a tumah
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hope it arrives soon
<NewDCD> 9 so actually playing for good shipping would make it too expensive
<FlaschenJoe11> it's a plot by Lex Luthor to finally destroy Superman
<NewDCD> 9 me too ;___; I want Itchy-Go to bro it out with Twahlaght Spahkleh
<NewDCD> 9 That said

<CriticKitten> Oshit, Bieber Jr is getting violent
<AllisZero> Rofl
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah NewDCD, I saw the link
<FlaschenJoe11> Wait no, XANATOS Planned that Illness to rope the Gargoyles into his services to get a magical artifact, that he will use to make more money
<Flutterz> too many hormones in him
<Flutterz> chop his balls off
<FlaschenJoe11> And the Kid is his main Henchman
<Flutterz> if he is Bieber, that is
<NewDCD> 9 Pinkie: gotta make up for that total affront to justice
<FlaschenJoe11> Only then He can become Bieber, or what Flutterz
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's especially why I want to take pics of Faiz riding ponies, NewDCD :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15For great justice!
<FlaschenJoe11> Kid is on Steroid
<Flutterz> then we can stop the confusion
<FlaschenJoe11> *Steroids
<Flutterz> you know, how some people think Bieber is a dude
<FlaschenJoe11> He strangely is, just like Bill from Tokyo Hotel is one.
<Pony_Luna> why is the next ep in 16 days o0
<Flutterz> lol
<Flutterz> too skinny
<FlaschenJoe11> It's CN evil plan to destroy us!

<Flutterz> the only cure is a shotgun
<Flutterz> buckshot
<FlaschenJoe11> Nah, not close enough to SPace or the Arctic
<Flutterz> SPAAAAAAAACE
<CriticKitten> Agreed. Best if it's done quickly, too, to avoid infestation.
<FlaschenJoe11> And if you have to use some special Ammo, use Dragon Breath
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, is that yours, NewDCD?

<FlaschenJoe11> The Light In The Darkness is considered by many to be one of the most heartwarming fanfics in the fandom and quickly became extremely popular on both deviantART and Equestia Daily. Despite being a one shot and relatively short, it's gained a reputation for being heartwarming enough to neutralize reading the infamous Cupcakes fanfic.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh wow

<MoonDasher> Oh?
<MoonDasher> MoonDasher:
<Lagmobile> hey a new MAD sketch thats actually funny
<NewDCD> oh yeah we're streaming all Digimans seasons eventually
<Flaria> I have no preference between the english and japanese versions of S1 digimon. <3
*Flaria hugs Flutterz
*Flutterz hugs Flaria
<CriticKitten> Wear a coat then, you dope! D:<
<Flutterz> my irc stopped updating :P
<NewDCD> I like JP better just due to the fact the opening is Butter-fly
<NewDCD> Over here in LatAm, we got Japanese script plus the JP songs dubbed into Spanish really well, plus US names
<NewDCD> Was the best of both worlds
<ThePretender> fair warning, everybody, if we get to S2 in English
<CriticKitten> Huh
<ThePretender> my Davis/Daisuke fanboyism knows NO BOUNDS
<Flaria> Oh lord.
<Lagmobile> I dont even remember everyones names...
<Flaria> In S1?
<Lagmobile> its been so long...
<Lagmobile> at all
<Flaria> :(
<CriticKitten> And then everypony fell into the Twilight Zone
<Zephirdd> Oh, I remember when I watched all of G2, G3 and G4 Digimon
<Dumori> damn I was a kid when I first saw this
<Zephirdd> but not G1
<Zephirdd> in jp
<Alcolt_Wesker> What power.
<NewDCD> we're getting them in JP
<NewDCD> Because that's the closest to the Spanish dub
<NewDCD> Aka BEST DUB
<Alcolt_Wesker> If I can only harvest this power...
<Alcolt_Wesker> I will be a GOD.
<Lagmobile> I was never a hardcore fan to begin with
<Zephirdd> I just love the evolution songs
<ThePretender> awwww, US dub was good... ;_;
<Zephirdd> the storylines are kinda cool, but nothing tops the evo songs
<NewDCD> if you could harvest said power
<NewDCD> You'd become a Harvest Moon protagonist
<Dumori> I can't rember any thing about this now
<Alcolt_Wesker> Yes... and all the radishes would be /mine/.
<Natleyn> :l
<Alcolt_Wesker> Only a handful of vegetables truly matter
<Zephirdd> alcolt: mine as in rarity MINE?
<ThePretender> Complte. Global. Plantation.
<Lagmobile> why does the audio eep going up and down...?
<Alcolt_Wesker> The rest is just so much chaff!
<Lagmobile> keep*
<NewDCD> DIGIMON DIGITAL MONSTERS THIS SONG SUCKS DONGS
<NewDCD> Really the JP version is much better due to the audio side of things
*Natleyn hugs Flaria
<Natleyn> Leave, ghost.
<Alcolt_Wesker> AHA! FOUND YOU!
<Zephirdd> yes, I always meant the JP songs
<Zephirdd> Butterfly fucking rocks
*Alcolt_Wesker slaps Natleyn with a trout at light speed
<Lagmobile> My mixer keeps changing only my browser audio level...
<NewDCD> >Yfw Masaaki Endo sung a cover of Butter-fly and it was orgasmic
<Zephirdd> >yfw idk who Masaaki Endo is
<ThePretender> the name is familiar....
<Alcolt_Wesker> You can't hide forever!
*Alcolt_Wesker searches in the dark for NewDCD
<NewDCD> gotta go study so yeah later
<Lagmobile> Im off too
<Lagmobile> night guys
<ThePretender> later NewDCD and Lagmobile
<Dumori> later
<ThePretender> oh Joe
<ThePretender> you so funny
<ThePretender> but reliable
<Flutterz> haven't watched any form of digimon in like... 9 years
<Flaria> Best part of the english dub
<Dumori> same Flutterz
<Flaria> "We can be funny!" "Haaaaaah"
<Flutterz> and 9 years is more than half my age lol
<Flutterz> just barely tho
*ThePretender struggles to remember that part of the dub.
<ThePretender> I do remember my shipping tendencies, though.
<ThePretender> TaixSora and DavisxKari are my OTPs
<Flaria> Is it just me or does the japanese version have way better music
<ThePretender> it does, as I am coming to learn
<Dumori> aye
<Alcolt_Wesker> When Celestia is out of the way... I will be the /only/ god.
<Alcolt_Wesker> B]
<ThePretender> what about Luna, Alcolt?
<Alcolt_Wesker> Oh, I've already arranged for /those/ matters...
<Flutterz> btw is this the first season/version/whatever you want to call it?
*Trollestia hornstabs Alcolt
<ThePretender> yep, FLutterz, this is Adventure 01
<Flutterz> sweet
<Dumori> who's streamin'
<CriticKitten> And then they all died?
<Flutterz> the end
*Alcolt_Wesker phantom butterflies off of the horn.
<ThePretender> huh, this sounds like some of the music in the Digimon MMO...
*Alcolt_Wesker bleeds.
<NewDCD> Digimon Adventure
<Alcolt_Wesker> This isn't over...
<Flutterz> now they evolve amirite?
<Trollestia> k
<Flaria> Has anyone played a Digimon game they thoroughly enjoyed?
<Flaria> Flutterz: yes.
<Trollestia> Nope.
<ThePretender> Digimon Rumble Arena
<NewDCD> also I am but I'm not on my PC so I got shit running in autopilot yeah
<Flutterz> predictable plot is predictable :P
*Alcolt_Wesker phantom butterflies back into the darkness.
<Zephirdd> tatakaonakia
<ThePretender> inb4 Digivolve
<NewDCD> that reminds me that there's a Digimon World game due for PSP next year and it will play similar to World 01
<NewDCD> I hope it gets localized ;___;
<Flutterz> awesome
<NewDCD> Also
<NewDCD> for the record
<CriticKitten> That pig has razor teeth dude
<ThePretender> I hope they bring over the new show, the cross over one
<Rainbow-Dash> Acolt_Wesker...
*NewDCD 's favorite Digimans series is Tamers
<Flaria> NewDCD: What!? I want it! Bring it overrrrrrrr ;_______;
<Rainbow-Dash> You dissapeared right as I started to ask you something
<Rainbow-Dash> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Flutterz> DCD, PSP or PSVita?
<Trollestia> Good riddance.
<NewDCD> PSP
<Flutterz> even better
<ThePretender> everyone's favorite season is Tamers (except me)
<Flutterz> PATAPON
<Flutterz> familiar faces
<Flaria> Tamers. <3
<Flutterz> oh the nostalgia
<NewDCD> one of the last announced games for the system
<NewDCD> Sadly since Vita is coming soon that means that chances of it being localized are smaller than normal
<Zephirdd> <3 Strong Heart
<Flaria> S4 had amazing potential..
*Flaria glomps herospirit
<Zephirdd> wait, its Brave Heart right
<Zephirdd> lol
<NewDCD> Tamers was awesome and darkish
<Flutterz> so many fire-based attacks
<NewDCD> Well that's what you get when you have the guy from Serial Experiments Lain make a Digimon series
<Zephirdd> G4 Digimon was cool, but digimon kinda blew after G21
<herospirit> What amazing reaction time Flaria
<Zephirdd> G2
<Kalisia> Okay guys pain meds win, I can't stay awake any longer.
<Flutterz> no way they'll beat anything fire-aligned
<Kalisia> 'Night.
<NewDCD> >Blew
<CriticKitten> Hit the weak spot for massive damage
<NewDCD> >Tamers
<Dumori> night Kalisia
<Dumori> I know that feeling
<NewDCD> how about I slap your shit
*Flaria hugs Kalisia
<Flutterz> night Kalisia
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<Zephirdd> G5 was pure trash
<CriticKitten> G'night Kalisia, feel better!
<Zephirdd> I didn't even bother with G6
<ThePretender> later Kalisia
<Flaria> I despise g5 for some reason. :l
<Flutterz> which one was the one with the obelisk things?
<ThePretender> G@
<ThePretender> *G2
<Flaria> Oh. He mad.
<ThePretender> which is my favorite
<herospirit> And then everypony died
<NewDCD> also Digimon exists in a multiverse
<NewDCD> Ryo from Tamers was born in Tai's world
<Zephirdd> G4 is my fav for the musics
<NewDCD> He ended up on the world of Tamers thanks to dimension-hopping shenanigans
<Flutterz> yeah, I remember it being pretty damn good
<Zephirdd> G2 is my fav for the plot
<Flutterz> I also remember watching the movie a bajillion times
<Kalisia> Ugh, I zoned off right before I was going to hit the quit button.
<Flutterz> lol
<Flutterz> g'night
<ThePretender> I have all 4 movies (in the US dub) recorded on a VHS
<herospirit> Was G4 the one where the main characters transformed instead of having digimon?
<Zephirdd> yes
<ThePretender> yep herospirit
<Flaria> Yep!
<NewDCD> also Justimon, his Merge Digivolution, is based on Kamen Rider, specially in Riderman
<herospirit> The music. Oh gog.
<Flutterz> i seem to remember that too
<NewDCD> How can you dislike a Digimon series with the freaking Kamen Rider DCD of the Digimon multiverse
<ThePretender> I liked it
<Flutterz> somewhat
<herospirit> I agree G4 had the best music.
<Flutterz> how many Gs are there in total?
<herospirit> 52
<Flutterz> O_O
<Flaria> 5 afaik.
<ThePretender> doesn't Ryo show up in Ken;s flashback in S2, DCD?
<Flaria> Did they start a 6th? >_>
<Flutterz> so 5 or 52? lol
<herospirit> Definitely 52
<Zephirdd> 5
<Flutterz> k'
<herospirit> :I
<herospirit> P-p-p-poker face.
<Flutterz> Kalumon's Deus Ex Machina is awoken
<ThePretender> There are currently 6 series, with a 7th on the way.
<Ultra_Boom3> O hai
<Dumori> spoiler preview x3
<Zephirdd> G3 was full of emo bs, and very cheesy towards the and
<Zephirdd> end*
<NewDCD> 6 started last year, animu-wise
<NewDCD> Though there's also V-Tamer and the assorted mangos and games
<Flutterz> there was also one where there were digimon that ate the world's code
<Flutterz> which one was that?
<ThePretender> the 7th will be a crossover one with previous protagonist showing up
<Zephirdd> that... was G4
<Zephirdd> iirc
<herospirit> I think so, Zeph.
<CosmicDashie|AFK> zomg digimon
<Zephirdd> G3 digimons would eat other digimon code
<Zephirdd> G4 digimons ate the world
<CosmicDashie> omg
<CosmicDashie> thats so badass
<Flutterz> yep
<herospirit> ......
<herospirit> Guys. We watch ponies.
<Flutterz> Now I'm probably gonna spend my days rewatching everything -_-
<herospirit> And we think Digimon is badass.
<herospirit> We are
<Zephirdd> lol
<herospirit> totally awesome
<Zephirdd> I don't think digimon is badass
<Flutterz> amazing
<ThePretender> Digimon IS badass.
<Zephirdd> I only like the songs
<Zephirdd> D:
<Dumori> Digimon is always halfway between awesome and stupid for me
<Zephirdd> YES
<Zephirdd> perfect description
<herospirit> Iknoright Dumori
<Flutterz> at the very least I've always liked it more than pokemon :D
<CriticKitten> Fair. It tended to flicker between those two pretty often
<Zephirdd> lol pokemon is good because games, the anime sucks
<Flutterz> true
<Dumori> yeah
<Flutterz> the games are awesome
<Flaria> ^whar
<Flaria> What
<Zephirdd> although I just found out that Meowth is out of TR and is now travelling with Ash
<Zephirdd> lol
<Flaria> ^WHAT
<Flutterz> The pokemon games are great
<ThePretender> eeeeyup, a friend told me about it
<Flaria> Damn, I must've been gone longer than I thought...
<CosmicDashie> omg, japanese > dubbed digimon
<Flutterz> pretty damn good turn-based rpg
<Dumori> TF! are they on?
<Zephirdd> B&W had a cool story, but could totally be done without a new generation imo
<NewDCD> Pokemon started good, but that was because they had a set idea and length for the plot
<NewDCD> Then they started extending it and the rest is history
<Zephirdd> Cosmic: pretty much anything in japanese is better than the dub
<Zephirdd> except JP DBZ vs PTBR DBZ
*ThePretender feels like he's the only one who likes the dub for Digimon. ;_;
<Dumori> Hellsing is = in dub and sub weirdly
<Zephirdd> idk about enus dub
<herospirit> Is it wrong that I giggle at the baby level digimon getting smacked around?
<Zephirdd> ptbr dub kinda sucks
<Flutterz> Patamon = Patapon
<NewDCD> the only bad thing about JP DBZ is the fact Goku's voice is annoying
<Zephirdd> well, it's the standard voice for these kid-like characters
<Zephirdd> see Luffy
<CriticKitten> Tentomon, and yet there are no tentacles. Dunno if I should be annoyed or relieved.
<NewDCD> I liked his LatAm voice a lot better
<Zephirdd> ^I've seen enough hentai..
<Flutterz> lol
<NewDCD> Tentomon digivolves to...
<Zephirdd> btw
<NewDCD> Tentaclerapemon!
<ThePretender> Kabuterimon!

<Rohan> Shell is motorboat?
<SuperBrony64> I think Pinkie Pie shipping with Discord would make an excellent fan ficiton.
<Flutterz> lol
<ThePretender> I think that defines crack shipping
<Flutterz> so true
<SuperBrony64> Crack shipping? Lol
<Flutterz> shipping while you're on crack?
<ThePretender> well...no
<ThePretender> as in a ship that is so insane
<Flutterz> oh
<Flutterz> :(
<SuperBrony64> It's not an insane shipping.
<ThePretender> that it might as well have been done on crack
<Rohan> Wouldn't that be applespike?
<SuperBrony64> Someone else drew the comic, not me :P
<herospirit> Applejack x An apple tree
<herospirit> :I
<Rohan> BloomBerg.

<Flaria> Palmon was coolest rookie, imo.

<herospirit> "GhosttTrolley? Nest get pm!"
<herospirit> What
<herospirit> What the hell happened to my typing
<Zephirdd> *insert anti-joke chicken here* The high humidity of water increases the smells of its surrounding and causes a sensation on your noses, and since this only happens when there is a lot of water nearby, your body assigns the amplified smell of plants and earth and the high humidity as "water smell"
<herospirit> That wasn't even close.
<herospirit> My sentence I mean.
<Flaria> Zephirdd: This
<Swerve> how do I become a pony
<herospirit> I'll try again.
<Flaria> Magic.
<Zephirdd> Swerve: die and go to heaven, its Equestria.
<herospirit> "Ghost trolley? Best get on!"

<Zephirdd> Wait

<Zephirdd> now that I think about R34b(If it exists, there is pony of it, no exceptions), is there any digimon/pony fanart?
<Flutterz> the tall guy in green i think is matt
<Zephirdd> I've seen pokemon/pony, but I don't remember digimon

<herospirit> And now I practice German. Repetitively. Online for half an hour. With a pre recorded voice.
<Zephirdd> Flaria: I hope you get better =) If I may, I'd recommend you to read the fic "A Drop of Moonshine" by Pen Stroke for some good laughs
<herospirit> ENTERTAIN ME PEOPLE
<Zephirdd> well, I'm out everypony
<Zephirdd> good night
<SuperBrony64> That's why, I bang my head against the keyboard!
*Zephirdd hugs #bronystate
*Flaria hugs Zephirdd goodnight
<SuperBrony64> *bangs head against the keyboard*
<ThePretender> later Zephirdd
<Flaria> Sleep well, you! :3
<Rohan> Lol, yah missed.
<SuperBrony64> Night Zephirdd
<Zephirdd> cya~
<Rohan> Power strokes?
<SuperBrony64> These characters are speaking funny…doesn't sound anything like English *troll face*
<herospirit> Cya Zeph!
<SuperBrony64> And thus…the room draws quiet...
*Flaria hugs Dashite
<AllisZero> BROOM
*ThePretender blasts some music.
<AllisZero> THERE GO ALL THE HAIRS BEHIND MY NECK
<ThePretender> QUIET, NOW?
<AllisZero> ALL STANDING UP LIKE A GODDAMN SUPER SAIYAN
<SuperBrony64> That digimon can't just randomly evolve...
<Dashite> AUGH! GET HIM OFF! GET HIM OFF ME!
<SuperBrony64> That's not how Pokemon works :/
<Rohan> THERE GO ALL THE HAIRS AROUND MY ARMS AND BODY.
<AllisZero> Kimi shika dekinai koto ga aru aoi hoshi ni, hikari ga nakuseru you ni
<AllisZero> Kowase yoaki na kimi wo, tsubuse usukau kabe wo. Atsui koto buki ni naru kara, believe in your heart~
<SuperBrony64> Oh dear, I'm so hungry...
<Rohan> OSHI DRAWFRIEND GOGOGOGOG
<SuperBrony64> OH BOY!
<Flaria> Dang it EqD
<Dumorimasoddaa> same SuperBrony64
<Flaria> I'm working on stuff >_<
<SuperBrony64> Drawfriend Stuff should ease the hunger
<Dumorimasoddaa> Ohai 3am
<SuperBrony64> Haha, Diamond Dog proposing to Rarity.
<AllisZero> >he could've gotten them food all along
<Dashite> I have a sudden urge to watch Transformers.
<Rohan> SPACE MARINE TRIXIE GOOD GOD
<KuchikiYorume> Hello.
<AllisZero> Serious twi in a green sweatsuit <3
<KuchikiYorume> Hullo.
<ThePretender> DAT DRAWFRIEND
<SuperBrony64> Hullo KuchikiYorume
<ThePretender> hey there KuchikiYorume
<KuchikiYorume> So... I've never been in a chat like this. Like, connected to a video and all that.
<SuperBrony64> "As I sit here, basking in the glow emanating from my computer screen, I ask myself truthfully if the hunger of my soul outweighs the feeling of Ponies…"
<SuperBrony64> To be continued...
<KuchikiYorume> When my friend told me about this, I assumed it was a forum of some sort.
<ctrlx> KuchikiYorume, it's IRC :3
<SuperBrony64> They are two separate entities that are married into one concept KuchikiYorume
<SuperBrony64> You watch, we watch, you talk, we talk.
<SuperBrony64> All in real time.
<AllisZero> Except during BMN, then communication is impossible
<ctrlx> except i don't watch :x
<AllisZero> Either you watch quietly and shout obscenities in chat
<Flaria> ffffffff, I missed drawfriend 198
<KuchikiYorume> Well, I figured once I entered. But then, it's hard for me to focus when there's some sort of interesting show on. *shrug*
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<SuperBrony64> It's nearly impossible during a Season 2 Premeire episode.
<SuperBrony64> KuchikiYorume: We tend to comment about what we are watching.
<ThePretender> like...
<Dumorimasoddaa> I remember when BMN was small and you could talk in it
<SuperBrony64> Sometimes though, it's a live feed of requests on YouTube or drawings. That's when there's a large participation from the viewers (LIKE YOU)
<Flaria> I remember the summer movie nights.
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's why we comunicate via memes at times
<ThePretender> "Where was Gondor when [insert thing here] was [insert noun verb]?"
<Dumorimasoddaa> Leaverage
<AllisZero> Sometimes, in the dead of night...
<Flaria> Where was Gondor when Flaria was Natleyn
<AllisZero> I like to imagine that...
<KuchikiYorume> Well, I'm pretty slow, so it may take me a while to fully understand. (yeah, I am a little dumb XD)
<SuperBrony64> Dumorimasoddaa: Tru dat.
<AllisZero> I'm a firetruck.
<Flaria> ^whut
<ThePretender> or
<AllisZero> (I have that as my comment on the IM at work, I got a bunch of WATs all day)
<ThePretender> WHere was BronySTate when the S2 stream crashed?
<KuchikiYorume> Omg Birdramon. I love Birdramon. And Seadramon... and Garurumon. I'm not too much into digimon, but I have one of the games.
<SuperBrony64> Trending meme...
<SuperBrony64> I LOVE ZELDA, HE IS SO COOL
<KuchikiYorume> ...he?
<KuchikiYorume> XD
<SuperBrony64> http://www.knowyourmeme.com
<herospirit> Lol, it's the "Idiot Nerd Girl" meme
<ThePretender> I LOVE LINK, SHE IS SO HAWT
<SuperBrony64> My Little Pony is ALWAYS trending.
<ThePretender> because Friendship is views
<SuperBrony64> My Little Pony is a big meme bag.
<Flaria> :3
<KuchikiYorume> I should be doing homework. XD
<SuperBrony64> KuchikiYorume: Same here :/
<herospirit> Why do I need to know how to say "I am Mr. Wagner" in German.
<herospirit> I am NOT Mr. Wagner. :I
<herospirit> LOL
<ThePretender> so John Joseco is drawing a human Scootaloo
<KuchikiYorume> Why do I have to write a freaking English paper... D:
<herospirit> >mfw the next thing it teaches me is "I am NOT Mr. Wagner"
<AllisZero> http://knowyourmeme.com/videos/17697-internet-is-leaking
<AllisZero> I LOLD
<ThePretender> gg herospirit
<herospirit> With mango languages, if you take Chinese, it teaches you how to say
<herospirit> "What happened to your face?"
<KuchikiYorume> lol
*Flaria huggles CloudRunner
<herospirit> I mean... is that really such a key phrase you need to know it to get by in China?
<KuchikiYorume> Apparently so.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Yes
<ThePretender> perhaps
<Dumorimasoddaa> In Chian Faces go missing ALL the time
<KuchikiYorume> At least in my Japanese class we learned USEFUL phrases. Like "can I borrow your pencil?"
<Dumorimasoddaa> x3
<CloudRunner> Oh shit! I come here to give a report to Flaria and look what fucking awesomeness is playing!
<herospirit> Well, in the German course, it taught me to say "That is not his wife" and "this is not my child"
<ThePretender> XD
<Flaria> YES!
<herospirit> X3
<Flaria> I'm getting reports~
<ThePretender> This is not my child
<KuchikiYorume> That kid has too deep of a voice <<
<ThePretender> BRILLIANT
<SuperBrony64> ThunderLOLCats FTW
<Flaria> herospirit: Preparing you for Maury, eh?
<herospirit> Key phrase in Germany, apparently.
*ThePretender brohoofs FLaria for that one
<herospirit> Must be alot of adultery and genetics confusion there
<KuchikiYorume> herospirit: You stole my line
<KuchikiYorume> XD
<herospirit> :P
*Flaria brohoofs ThePretender
<ThePretender> good old Maury
<SuperBrony64> I read the Pinkie Pie X Discord comic again
<SuperBrony64> BAAAAAAAAAWWW
<herospirit> Man, they taught me "Oh Really" and I can't help but pronounce it like the German equivalent of "ORLY"
<CloudRunner> So, who is the awesome pony I have to thank for this stream?
<KuchikiYorume> I'm one of the few people not into pony pairings
<ThePretender> newDCD\
<SuperBrony64> I believe it is NewDCD
*Flaria hugs Revolver
<Flaria> It is indeed NewDCD
<SuperBrony64> But he's not here right now so leave a message after the beep.
<SuperBrony64> *beep*
<CloudRunner> Thanks NewDCD! You rock!
<ThePretender> when it comes to pairing, it's mainly rhe background ones
<KuchikiYorume> I think Birdramon is trolling them <<
<Dumorimasoddaa> tr56gtvrfcb?~}
<Dumorimasoddaa> {http://saintv812.sa.funpic.org/Sheets/UHM_Dhampir_3_15.pdf
<ThePretender> like Octvaia and Vinyl
<KuchikiYorume> These people/digimon just wanna drink XD
<Dumorimasoddaa> wow epic falce roll there
*herospirit takes German class for English speakers
<Dumorimasoddaa> sorry I think I need to sleep
<NewDCD> DAT SNIPER SCOPE
*herospirit learns to say "I understand no English"
<herospirit> ....
<ThePretender> the irony
<KuchikiYorume> Oh, not Birdramon. Don't judge an episode by its title XD
<CloudRunner> Lyra and Bon-Bon ThePretender
<Dumorimasoddaa> I managed to ctrl + v with my face
<ThePretender> well, that too
<AllisZero> Gius
<SuperBrony64> Hello American Ponies , "I…no…understand the English"? I get right?!
<Dumorimasoddaa> noe even soure HOW
<AllisZero> GUYS
<AllisZero> GUUUYYYSSSS
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74mhQyuyELQ&feature=player_embedded
<NewDCD> pausing for a sec
<AllisZero> My god. put this on 1080p, fullscreen
<AllisZero> And trip
<NewDCD> preparing a playlist for the night
<NewDCD> preparing a playlist for the night
*ThePretender is lol'ing in real life
<CloudRunner> Aslo,I love what you are doing here NewDCD
<CloudRunner> Heres a question for everypony: How do YOU pronounce Lyra? Do you go with Lie-ra or Lee-ra?
<ThePretender> Lie-ra
<Dumorimasoddaa> Ohai Rider
<KuchikiYorume> I go with Lie-ra
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD is here!
<CloudRunner> Yay! These ponies know how to pronounce names!
<KuchikiYorume> I think of it like "Myra" or "Nyra" which I pronounce in a similar manner.
<KuchikiYorume> But then... when you say "Lyra" I think of Pkmn HG/SS
*ThePretender should really get back to HG/SS
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: CloudRunner left you the following message: "Thanks NewDCD! You Rock!"
<NewDCD> kay there we go
<AllisZero> Alright everypony, going off to bed.
<AllisZero> Good night to you all
<SuperBrony64> Night AllisZero
<KuchikiYorume> Bye-bye!
<ThePretender> I waited a year to play that game because I had the game but no DS
<AllisZero> See you in the morning
<ThePretender> later AllisZero
<NewDCD> that should last through the night till I come shut it off 4 AM-ish
<herospirit> night Allis
*Flaria hugs AllisZero goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<CloudRunner> Some people on youtube pronounce it Lee-ra. I cant see why, seeing as she has a Lyre on her flank.
*AllisZero hugs Flaria back
<AllisZero> Good night :3
<CloudRunner> Night AllisZero
<AllisZero> Night!
<herospirit> Lol, German has the best way to identify husbands and wives
<ThePretender> exactly, CloudRunner, my rationale is due to the lyre
<herospirit> It's just "Mein Mann" or "Mein Frau"
<herospirit> So just my man or my woman.
<Dumorimasoddaa> yup
<Trollestia> If Rainbow wasn't the best pony, Vinyl probably would be.
<SuperBrony64> guttentag
<ThePretender> Ich bin Berliner
<herospirit> guten abend
<herospirit> Aber nicht /ein/ Berliner?
<SuperBrony64> Mein Little Ponies
<ThePretender> I'm quoting Kennedy ;_;
<CloudRunner> The Mane 6 all tie. They are all equally awesome.
<SuperBrony64> I think I'm doing it right...
<herospirit> Mein Kleines Pferden
<Dumorimasoddaa> Ja
<SuperBrony64> WONDERBAR DAT GOOD YES?!
<ThePretender> Mis Pequenos Caballos
<herospirit> ...except I capitalized "klein"
<Dumorimasoddaa> Though I think in the dub they keep it as MY little Ponies
<herospirit> my bad
<SuperBrony64> Dumorimasoddaa: NEIN!
<herospirit> And it's "wunderbar" :P
<SuperBrony64> herospirit: It's mein wonderbar, I can choose to call it whatever I wish
<Dumorimasoddaa> The one thing I screw up with German is capitalising every noun
<CloudRunner> Air Shot = best attack.
<ThePretender> I hear wunderbar, and I'm reminded of Richtofen from COD zombies
<herospirit> Lol XD
<KuchikiYorume> I <3 Air shot. I just love Patamon. ^^
<CloudRunner> "I got me a wonder waffle!"
<KuchikiYorume> And cute lil' Piyomon <3
<KuchikiYorume> Ooh, digivolve tiem
<ThePretender> Veemon is best mon for me
<Dumorimasoddaa> epic SONG GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<CloudRunner> Piyomon is the one that digivolves into the badass with the chaingun right?
<KuchikiYorume> Oh yeah, Piyomon digivolves into BIRDRAMON! One of my faves!
<ThePretender> don't think so, CloudRunner
<ThePretender> it's Piyomon->Birdramon->Garudamon
<CloudRunner> Is it the little blue (striped) one with the horn? (cant fucking remember his name)
<KuchikiYorume> Garumon?
<SuperBrony64> It's actually Pikachu -> Raichu, but you'll get the hang of it
<CloudRunner> yea that one! ^
<herospirit> Ohp, here it is, got back to "This is not my child"
<Flaria> ... today just isn't my day.
<ThePretender> Gabumon -> Garurumon -> Weregarugumon -> Metalgarurumon
<CloudRunner> Which one eventualy gets the fucking guns on its arm?
<SuperBrony64> Flaria: :<
<KuchikiYorume> I want a Piyomon. ^^
<CloudRunner> What is wrong Flaria?
<ThePretender> Terriermon -> whatever it evolves to
<KuchikiYorume> I have decided I don't like Meramon. It won't shut up.
<SuperBrony64> I have to go now everypony. My people need me!
*ThePretender gives Flaria a hug.
<KuchikiYorume> Bai
<SuperBrony64> *waves goodbye*
<CloudRunner> Bye SuperBrony64!
*Flaria hugs SuperBrony64, CloudRunner and ThePretender
<KuchikiYorume> *Ichimaru Gin-style wave* Baibai!
*ThePretender waves goodbye to SuperBrony64.
<Flaria> Sleep well, SuperBrony64!
<ThePretender> GIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
<herospirit> Cya Supes!
*CloudRunner MECHA HUGs Flaria
<Flaria> Things just not going my way.
<ThePretender> so, what's up Flaria? If you don't mind me/us asking?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Ugh I'm gonna make me a hot choclate then go to bed
<Dumorimasoddaa> I keep face planting the keyboard
<ThePretender> that ain't good, Dumori
<KuchikiYorume> Tokomon is frickin scary D:
<CloudRunner> Renamon and BlackWarGraymon tie for the most badass Digimon.
<herospirit> Annnnnd done.
<NewDCD> okay guys going to bed
<Flaria> Going back to old gamecube games was terrible. :l I had fun, but... too arrogant, even if I /am/ that good.
*Flaria hugs NewDCD goodnight
<NewDCD> hope you enjoy the night lineup
<CloudRunner> Night NewDCD!
<NewDCD> night
<KuchikiYorume> ...arrogance is adorable.
<CloudRunner> I sure will!
<ThePretender> later newDCD
<Flaria> Sleep well, my little mecha :3
<KuchikiYorume> If it's pulled off the right way...
<ThePretender> also, most badass digimon are Magnamon and Imperialdramon Paladin Mode
<CloudRunner> ^ yea probably
<KuchikiYorume> I like Tylilinmon. It's so pretty. And Dorugamon.
<Flaria> I feel like I have a ball of darkness in the pit of my... I'd say stomach, but its more like the center of, well, myself.
<herospirit> I don't remember my digimon very well :I
<KuchikiYorume> I just played one of the games, so I don't know very many either.
<herospirit> Release it Flaria
<CloudRunner> Cant remember his name but the 5 storie fossil dinosaur that Greymon digivolves into is by far the most badass
<herospirit> Don't be afraid of the dark energy in your soul
<KuchikiYorume> Flaria: :( Do you need a hug?
<Flaria> I'd like one. u.u
<MrChang> STORIES
*ThePretender hugs Flaria again!
*KuchikiYorume hugs
<herospirit> RELEASE YOUR SOUL ENERGY FLARIA
*Flaria hugs ThePretender and KuchikiYorume
<ThePretender> cheer up, Flaria!
<KuchikiYorume> What sort of Soul Energy?
<herospirit> THE ELEMENT OF DARKNESS IS IN YOU
<CloudRunner> Flaria feel the energy flowing through you! Let it build up. Let it get super concentraited. And then, RELEASE!!!
<ThePretender> what herospirit and CloudRunenr are saying
<KuchikiYorume> You say "soul energy" and I just think Reiatsu/Spiritual Pressure...
<herospirit> Direct it through your body! Form it between your hands!
<ThePretender> ahh, good old Bleach
<KuchikiYorume> My name screams "Bleach fan" XD
<KuchikiYorume> 'cause of the sirname in there, obviously
<Flaria> Kind of. xD
<herospirit> >yfw I'm not even referencing anything
<MrChang> my name screams "MRCHANG"
<KuchikiYorume> Well, also, "diehard Byakuya fan"
<CloudRunner> I was talking about how to succesfully Shoop your Whoop.
<ThePretender> all you gotta do, is rouse that fighting spirit! FEEL THAT HOT BLOOD COURSE THROUGH YOUR BODY AND LET IT PERMEATE YOUR SOUL
<herospirit> Hmmm
<KuchikiYorume> Ah, Byakuya-sama. :D
<herospirit> How would I pronounce "Dark Sphere" in bad engrish?
<Flaria> MrChang: Oh you
<CloudRunner> Toshi is best Captian
*herospirit clears his throat
<KuchikiYorume> Daaku sufiiaa!
<herospirit> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWK
<ThePretender> RAISE YOUR FIST TO THE HEAVENS AND LET 'EM HAVE IT!
<herospirit> SUUUUUFIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAA
<ThePretender> also, Yoruichi is best captain
*Flaria huggles herospirit
<Flaria> ThePretender: This
<ThePretender> when she was a captain
<KuchikiYorume> Yoruichi needs to respect the nobility higher than her. D<
<herospirit> :3
<CloudRunner> herospirit daruku Spfear
<KuchikiYorume> Shinouin are pretty high up in social status, but there is a better clan...
<herospirit> daraku spfear?
<ThePretender> pfffft
<ThePretender> no Kuchiki could catch up to her!
<KuchikiYorume> Which is why she flaunts it... because it's the ONLY thing she's better than Kuchikis at. <3
<MrChang> im watching moar house
<MrChang> ahmigawd
<ThePretender> OH NO YOU DIDN'T
<MrChang> its so good
<MrChang> makes me just wanna club a baby seal
<herospirit> Chang
<ThePretender> say what O_O
<CloudRunner> has anyone seen the episode where Toshiro is allowed to go all out? That fucking badass freezes the entire area within a 5 mi radius.
<herospirit> That's your answer to everything
<ThePretender> ewwwwww Toshiro
<KuchikiYorume> I've only gotten to the bount arc. And YES I WILL WATCH IT.
<KuchikiYorume> So I haven't seen much of the fights... but Byakuya-sama vs Ichigo will probably always be my fav.
<CloudRunner> Last 3 episodes of the Bount arc are made of the EXACT same flashback.
<ThePretender> you've reference one of my least favorite parts of Bleach, CloudRunner
<Flaria> Kenpachi is my favourite current captain <3
<CloudRunner> I was very dissapoint
<ThePretender> Kenpachi is best captain
<CloudRunner> ^
<ThePretender> and Halibel was best Espada ;_;
<KuchikiYorume> Ooh, Kenpachi's my third favourite captain. Well, unless you don't count Gin, then he's my second favourite.
<ThePretender> RIP sweet princess
*Flaria bows in awe of the great and powerful Kenpachi Zaraki
<Dumori> Night all
*Flaria hugs Dumori goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well!
*ThePretender sheds manly tears for Halibel.
<KuchikiYorume> Kenpachi is badass.
<ThePretender> later Dumori
*Dumori hugs Flaria
<MoonDasher> Hey guys, this is LordCelestia. Sorry I havent been able to be on here a lot in the past few days, ive been really busy.
<KuchikiYorume> If he reached SHIKAI he'd blow up the world D:
<Dumori> later #bronystate
<CriticKitten> Ha, figures a Bleach convo would start just as I'm going to bed. Oh well, health is a factor, no choice. G'night yall
<ThePretender> well, Kenpachi's sword is the same type as Ichigo's
<ThePretender> meaning he's in permanent Shikai
<ThePretender> later CriticKitten
<KuchikiYorume> Well, I'm always willing to talk about Bleach. Just look for KuchikiYorume! XD
<CloudRunner> ThePretender What is wrong with Toshi having the most powerfull ice type sword? KuchikiYorume Gin is no captian
<KuchikiYorume> Yeah, I know
<CloudRunner> night Dumori
<Flaria> ThePretender: I too shed tears for Harribel. >_<
<KuchikiYorume> But if you count him from before the betrayal, than he's my second fave
<ThePretender> well, I don't like the character much...and THAT part had him beta Hallibel and I was like "NOOOOOO ;_;"
<herospirit> and then he split someone in half. :I
<KuchikiYorume> Gin's my second favourite character regardless
<ThePretender> *beat
<herospirit> OhTheyDodged
<KuchikiYorume> My favourite character... well, I'd be pretty worried if you haven't figured that out by now XD
<CloudRunner> Flaria I was sad to find out that Lilinet dies fast
<ThePretender> all the good Espada died badly
<herospirit> .....
<ThePretender> Starrk/Lilinet, Hallibel
<CloudRunner> I lold at Nell's full name
<KuchikiYorume> Zommari deserved to die. I don't know much about it, but still. XD
<herospirit> I'm glad I don't really plan on watching Bleach
<herospirit> Because you guys are just throwin' spoilers around will nilly
<CloudRunner> That fag with 50 something eyes? KuchikiYorume
<KuchikiYorume> Yes.
<KuchikiYorume> That guy.
<ThePretender> he's voiced by Grim in the dub
<ThePretender> from Billy and Mandy
<CloudRunner> yea. arrogance like that is awefull.
<KuchikiYorume> Almost anyone who opposes Kuchiki Byakuya-sama deserve to die.
<CloudRunner> herospirit sorry bout that
<KuchikiYorume> And Zommari's arrogance... is intolerable. I loved watching the backwards race in the AE though.
<KuchikiYorume> herospirit: ...I'm sorry too... I should probably know to keep my mouth shut about that stuff, because I hate spoilers like the freaking devil
<herospirit> *RobotSnatch*
<CloudRunner> Nell's name is the only German sounding one out of the lot.
<Flaria> Bleach... egh.
<CloudRunner> lol
<herospirit> It's fine, I'll probably forget them by the time I start watching the show, if I ever do.
<Flaria> I like it, but by Celestia it just doesn't stop
*Flaria hugs Flutterguy
<CloudRunner> ^ this
<Flaria> Hiya!
<Flutterguy> Hey you!
<Flutterguy> And hey everyone
<Flaria> Flutterguy! I wanted to ask you today!
<Flutterguy> Huh?
<ThePretender> agreed Flaria
<Flaria> You were the one playing Terraria, right? o_o
<Flutterguy> Yeah, which reminds me.
<KuchikiYorume> Yeah... I just hope no more of my favourite characters die. Not saying who died, but one of them... well, rest in peace, my friend.
<Flutterguy> I found a jungle rose by accident. :3
<KuchikiYorume> Whoa, boob rockets XD Ahh, digimon
<Flaria> Yeah, I was wondering if you and me could play some time.
<Flutterguy> Oh, yeah, that'd be cool.
<Flaria> Flutterguy: D: Jelly! Its a 1:500 drop, I think
<Flutterguy> z;0
<CloudRunner> I like Terraria. Problem is, unless I play on hardcore it is no longer fun
<KuchikiYorume> Flutterguy: What are you playing?
<Flaria> 'cause I haven't played in a long while and I was thinking of building a Flaria character.
<Flaria> I was gonna get rid of my Star Cannon char.
<herospirit> How much does Terraria cost, again?
<Flaria> I mean, seriously
<Flutterguy> $10 herospirit
<Flaria> Star cannon and 2000 fallen stars?
<Flaria> :l
<KuchikiYorume> Terraria, then? I've never heard of it.
<Flutterguy> And Flaria, That'd be cool.
<Flaria> Yay! ;3
<Flutterguy> I'm still noob at it though XD
<herospirit> MEGGGA
<herospirit> FUUUDAAMMUUUU
<herospirit> BRRRRREEEEAAAAAAKAAAAAAAAH
*herospirit couldn't resist
<Flutterguy> Just tell me when you'd like to play and we can go for it Flaria.
<KuchikiYorume> No, "Buureekaaaaa" XD
<herospirit> Kuchiki, from what I've seen, Terarria is like fantasy RPG meets Minecraft
<Flutterz> sort of
<Flutterguy> I guess Terraria's like 2D Minecraft.
<herospirit> It's 2D
<Flutterz> 2d minecraft with much more combat-oriented gameplay
<herospirit> NNNNG
<Flutterguy> I haven't played Minecraft though :/
<herospirit> NNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIINNJJJJJJJJJJAAAAAAAAAAAA
<CloudRunner> Damnit Flutterguy! I knew someone would say "2d minecraft"!
<KuchikiYorume> Remember, if you wanna katakana-ize everything, the only character without a vowel sound in it is "n" so there has to be a vowel after almost everything XD
<KuchikiYorume> Terraria... oh, then I do know what it is.
<Flutterguy> CloudRunner you mad bro? XD
<KuchikiYorume> I saw someone playing it today at school XD
<Flaria> Terraria is like Minecraft, yes, but Minecraft is, even with 1.9, more of a building game
<CloudRunner> Kind of.
*Flaria hugs FlutterBro13
<Flaria> Welcome back!
<Flutterguy> Hey Flutterbro
<herospirit> And then friendship
<CloudRunner> Damn! Flaria has hawk eyes active on the user list!
<Dermathil> DIGIMON?!?
<FlutterBro13> Im reading some shakespeare right now
<Flaria> Terraria is an adventuring game with building elements, Minecraft is a building game with adventure elements
<Flutterz> yep

<herospirit> night Runnah
<rubenflonne> i only emulated the digimon games really, besides digimon world
<herospirit> ....
<rubenflonne> right now they are beta testing a digimon MMO
<herospirit> She dreams of doing laundry?
<herospirit> Her life must SUCK
<KuchikiYorume> lol
<KuchikiYorume> I dream of... more interesting things. ;)
<ThePretender> indeed they are ruben
<rubenflonne> im enjoying it
<ThePretender> oh, you're in it?
<herospirit> I dream of....
<herospirit> being a Pony. :I
<rubenflonne> only problem i have with it is the annoyence of no character changijng
<ThePretender> I dream of my ex and I'm like WHYYYYYYYYY
<KuchikiYorume> Last night, I had a dream that my sister had a flamethrower. >> And she nearly burned down the house.
<herospirit> No, actually. Never had a dream where I'm a pony.
<rubenflonne> or had to use season 4 digimon
<rubenflonne> or 5 i forgot
<herospirit> Had dreams with ponies in them though.
<ThePretender> I had my first pony dream last night
<herospirit> OH NOOOOOOOO
<Flaria> DANG IT
<KuchikiYorume> But I dream about ... someone... <3
<herospirit> IT'S SHITMON
<Flaria> EqD STOP MAKING ME WANT PONY STUFF <3
<KuchikiYorume> lol
<KuchikiYorume> ew
<rubenflonne> thats why they are known as viruses
<ThePretender> looks like the shit's...hit the fan
<KuchikiYorume> lol
<ThePretender> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<rubenflonne> what i like about digimon you can use them kinda like computer programs
<KuchikiYorume> Oh no, the liiiiiiiiiight!
<KuchikiYorume> It burns us, it burns us!
<rubenflonne> some point if your good at computers you might hack them just like the guy in season 2 did, forgetting hsi name
<rubenflonne> *goes to digimon wiki*
<ThePretender> I want to say Ken
<herospirit> Yo dog who left these vending machines all over the fucking place
<rubenflonne> its ken
<herospirit> Someone has to clean this shit up you know
<KuchikiYorume> What I'm wondering is how the heck they're managing to poop this much >>
<ThePretender> Fiber. Lots of fiber.
<rubenflonne> lol yes it was ken his digimon was wormmon
<KuchikiYorume> I knew someone would say that
<rubenflonne> HEART ATTACK~!
<ThePretender> WaruMonzaemon was scary
<KuchikiYorume> Oh, I hate that bear
<KuchikiYorume> It scares the crap out of me
<herospirit> BOOM
<ThePretender> and that episode made me feel bad for the poor Numemon
<rubenflonne> agreed
<Flaria> People who want to know why I don't make separate Working in Background and Busy cursors: The only difference between the two, according to Microsoft themselves, is that you can still interact with stuff using Working in Background
<herospirit> Saved by the shitmon
<KuchikiYorume> No thanks, I don't wanna date someone who threw shit at me
<herospirit> geez, she could at least thank it. :I
<herospirit> ....For the saving. Not for the shit.
<ctrlx> Flaria, yah that's about right
<Flutterz> Babes in Toytown, anyone :P

<Flaria> ctrlx: Busy apparently doesn't even have a hotspot, so you can't click on anything
<ThePretender> as I said on the FB page
<rubenflonne> i liked matts japanese voice
<ThePretender> WOrst movie clause is best clause
<herospirit> ....For a perfect level, he kinda sucks
<rubenflonne> welcome to toy town* cyclopes eyes*
*Flaria yawns
<herospirit> ...Low SPD, high DEF, I guess.
<ctrlx> ugh. i feel exhausted. i got a lot done today though. i'm gonna roll into bed super super super early tonight.
*Flaria hugs ctrlx

<Flutterz> g'night ctrlx
<rubenflonne> also very high con indeed
*ctrlx snuggles up with his pinkie pie plushie
<herospirit> Lovely attack = the very most retarded thing I've seen in this show thus far
<Flutterguy> Bye ctrlx!
<KuchikiYorume> Ikr
<rubenflonne> its heart attack :D they die of a heart attack! :D
<Flaria> See, now I wouldn't really have a problem with having the main cursor in most of the loading animations....
<Flaria> But it wouldn't even fit in Twi's book animation. :l
*Flaria sighs
<rubenflonne> by the way he is one of the worst ultimate digimon
<rubenflonne> well power wise
<Flutterz> aggro'd the boss
<herospirit> He's not ultimate he's perfect :0
<KuchikiYorume> I swear, that thing is pedobear
<ThePretender> I'm surprised no one's made a pedobear joke
<KuchikiYorume> ...
<KuchikiYorume> lol
<Flutterz> Level 85 Pedobear
<Flutterguy> ._.
<ThePretender> my timing is spectacular
<KuchikiYorume> Yes.
<Flutterguy> Pretender, MY timing is better.
<KuchikiYorume> I think I stepped in something! XD
<Flutterz> it's is utterly SMASHING
<rubenflonne> thats not what his wiki says, he is a ultimate level digimon, vaccine
<Flaria> What, the bear?
<herospirit> Sorry, I was using the japanese names >->
<Flaria> He's pretty weak.
<rubenflonne> ya
<rubenflonne> pretty weak for a ultimate as i said
<Flaria> He's more defensive, but that's... ehh
<herospirit> "Ultimate" in Japanese is what "Mega" is in English
<rubenflonne> ah right
<rubenflonne> so what did they call mega digimon level in japan
<Flutterz> Cactuses, ATTACK!
<herospirit> Ultimate
<Flaria> I've only played Digimon World DS, and anime is... well, it fluctuates.
<Flaria> :l
<rubenflonne> Fuck ya cactuse
<ThePretender> WaruMonzaemon is frightening
<Xerion> THEME MUSIC POWER UP
<rubenflonne> that one is a mega digimon
<herospirit> they called Ultimate ones "Perfect" and called Mega ones "Ultimate"
<rubenflonne> ah
<rubenflonne> my bad then
<herospirit> ...Did a Champion level just beat an Ultimate level?
<ThePretender> eeeyup
<ThePretender> I think
<herospirit> he really DID suck
<rubenflonne> but yes a champion level won up to a ultimate thats saying something about him
<rubenflonne> he sucks
<herospirit> Palmon, thank you for beating the shit out of me
<rubenflonne> i miss HEAET ATTACK x.x
<rubenflonne> heart**
<rubenflonne> not lovely
<Flaria> Anyone else think "Rookie -> Champion -> Ultimate -> Mega" is kinda stupid?
<Flutterz> Dope attack
<rubenflonne> nah
<Flaria> I'd switch the last two, personally.
<Flutterz> same
<ThePretender> same
<herospirit> YESH
*Flutterz highfive
<herospirit> I've always thought that
<Flutterz> same
*Flaria huggles herospirit
<KuchikiYorume> You'd think being trapped in one of those heart bubble things would make you... er...
<rubenflonne> i don't know i thought it seems resonable
<herospirit> I'd switch the last two Japanese ones as well; why is Ultimate better than Perfect?
<rubenflonne> exactly
<Flutterz> that especially bothers me
<Flutterz> well, we all know
<Flutterz> that Japan is a REALLY strange place
<herospirit> XD
<KuchikiYorume> XD
<Flutterz> XD
<rubenflonne> x3
<Flutterz> C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
<KuchikiYorume> Was born there~ ...don't remember anything from it though...
<rubenflonne> put on the digimon movie :D the first one
<rubenflonne> if you have it
<KuchikiYorume> I was two when we moved away D:
<Flaria> herospirit: "Alternate Select is used as a separate cursor for selecting things in certain applications."
<herospirit> O I C
<Flaria> >mfw they need two select cursors 3:<
<herospirit> Lol XD
<KuchikiYorume> The name Ikkakumon makes me laugh now
<Flaria> WHY DO YOU NEED ANOTHER CURSOR FOR SELECTING SOMETHING
<herospirit> I'll just use... uhhh...
<Flaria> Welcome back, Flutterz.
<rubenflonne> anyone here like the amarican opening music vs this?
<herospirit> the link select for the alternate select
<ThePretender> <- me
<herospirit> that's what I'll do
<Flutterz> I wasn't gone for THAT long, Flaria :P
<herospirit> I do too
<Flaria> Flutterz: Still. xD
<KuchikiYorume> I actually haven't seen any of the show until now, so... XD
<herospirit> But I have Nostalgia goggle
<herospirit> goggles*
<Flutterz> Yes, Nostalgia goggles ftw
<rubenflonne> i like it because it sounds better personaly
<rubenflonne> this seems meh
<herospirit> Okay wait
<herospirit> Yalls need to hear the English G4 theme
<herospirit> lemme grab it real fast.
<rubenflonne> xD
<ThePretender> ah, THAT one
<Flutterz> wait, it the Cactusmon a Champion?
<rubenflonne> ya
<Flutterz> that really is a weak ultimate then
<rubenflonne> we don't get their ultimate forms till they get back to the real world
<rubenflonne> and yes he was very very weak ultimate
<ThePretender> actually, they get their ultimate in the next big arc
<ThePretender> with the crests/tags
<Flutterz> The Eldest Scroll
<rubenflonne> http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/GigaWaruMonzaemon this one scares me very much so
<Flutterz> O_O
<herospirit> I wish the first half of the lyrics were less cheesy, but
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjJsh_Oaw6E <--- best digimon opening
<herospirit> AWWWW
<ThePretender> OH SWEET JESUS THAT'S A SCARY BEAR
<herospirit> embedding disabled
<rubenflonne> *burns it because its season 4*
<herospirit> one sec.
<rubenflonne> and yes its much more scary then warumonzaemon
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yku9_IlDUkY
<ThePretender> you are bringing back memories herospirit
<ThePretender> AS WE WORK TOWARDS ONE SOLUION
<herospirit> there we go this one works
<herospirit> The first half is so-so
<herospirit> second half is epic
<rubenflonne> kefka that swiping card thing blah
<ThePretender> I liked season 4, well...because I'd always wanted to turn into a Digimon myself...
<herospirit> I can see that.
<herospirit> Like, understand it, that kind of thing.
<Flaria> herospirit: I can't find anything on the internet saying where Handwriting is used as a cursor. :l
<rubenflonne> in honest opinion i did not like the egg digivolving but i enjoyed the DNA digivolving
<rubenflonne> not the human merging DNA digivolving
<herospirit> Just ignore it then Flaria :p
<Flaria> Yeah, but some ponies don't like not having a cursor for everything...
<ThePretender> yeah DNA digivolving was awesome
<ThePretender> Paildramon was a boss
<KuchikiYorume> Geez, this girl reminds me of someone ELSE who eats weird things. D:
<rubenflonne> just hated the DNA digivolving between armaarmodillo and patamon
<ThePretender> Shankuamon?
<rubenflonne> building up to the awesome fusion and get get a claydoll
<ThePretender> indeed
<herospirit> FIGHT HIM JYOU
<ThePretender> Zephyrmon was cool, but a bit confusing
<ThePretender> because of gender
<KuchikiYorume> You say Claydoll and I think Claydol... (I like Pokemon better than Digimon)
<rubenflonne> i was suprised it was not easy to break that digimon xD i was thinking that and laughing
<rubenflonne> xD
<rubenflonne> well here let me get you the digimon
<rubenflonne> also claydol is based on the old breakable dolls
<KuchikiYorume> I love how it can blow itself up though XD
<herospirit> Hey. Flaria. I'm going to make you cry now.
<herospirit> YOU READY?

<Lagmobile> this is still going on?
<ThePretender> indeed
<Flaria> Lagmobile: DCD set it up on a long playlist and went to sleep. xD
<rubenflonne> on a very awesome one on that note
<ThePretender> Digimon playlist is best playlist

<Lagmobile> rubenflonne I can tell you from experience it IS NOT an awesome mode of transportation...
<rubenflonne> xD
<Flaria> hero, check pm :<
<ThePretender> oh yeah, has eveybody liked the Brony Movie Night page on FB?
<rubenflonne> i did long time ago
<Lagmobile> I havnt used FB in months
<rubenflonne> haduken
<Lagmobile> I hate social networking with a burning passion for some reason...
<ThePretender> I did so yesterday
<rubenflonne> very funny thing about devimon is he is only a champion digimon and he causes all this xD
<rubenflonne> everyone treats him like a ultimate
<Flutterz> epic map is epic
<ThePretender> well, he IS fairly strong for a champion
<rubenflonne> well viruses do tend to be stronger soemtimes
<herospirit> I don't remember who the big bad ends up being
<herospirit> for G1
<KuchikiYorume> Must. Catch. Paper.
<Lagmobile> ... the fcc must of had a field day...
<herospirit> XD
<Flutterz> noes, the map!
<ThePretender> Apoclymon
<Lagmobile> with that line at least..
<herospirit> "KILL THE CHILDREN!"
<ThePretender> or however you spell that
<KuchikiYorume> Man... that Digimon even sounds a little like Tousen. And it's some Digimon of Justice...?
<KuchikiYorume> Probably not the same seiyu, but still XD
<Flutterz> Children cast Mass Divivolution!
<Flutterz> Digivolution*
<Lagmobile> Anime cliche No. [ive lost count] - Calling your attacks [CHECK]
<ThePretender> it goes Devimon -> Etamon -> Myotismon -> Dark Masters -> Apocalymon
<KuchikiYorume> "They evolved." ...no shit.
<Lagmobile> no shit they evolved how'd you guess?
<Flutterz> lol
<rubenflonne> Apocalymon was the ending digimon of season 1
<Flutterz> what's with the timings today?
<rubenflonne> evolved from Myotismon
<ThePretender> rocks fall, everyone dies?
<Flutterz> nope.avi
<Flutterz> just chuck testa
<Lagmobile> GM: Yup
<ThePretender> actually, MaloMyostismon from S2 came from Myotismon
<Lagmobile> Stop crossing the memes Flutterz!
<ThePretender> if I remember correctly, Apocalymon came out of nowhere
<rubenflonne> he has 3 digievolutions apparently
<ThePretender> LIKE A BAWS
<rubenflonne> VenomMyotismon[4]Apocalymon* (w/ DemiDevimon, Vilemon, LadyDevimon, SkullSatamon, Puppetmon)[5]
<Lagmobile> Do you want to be dissasembled molecule by molecule?
<herospirit> ....
<Flutterz> I find your lack of memes disappoint
<herospirit> it takes 4 champion levels to stop a rock
<herospirit> DUMB ROCK
<KuchikiYorume> Lagmobile: And again, that reminds me of something Bleach-related -_-
<ThePretender> THEY KILLED TOM
<rubenflonne> he had to use 4 digimon to DNA to apocalymon
<KuchikiYorume> Normal building my ass.
<Lagmobile> But that was a Ghostbusters referance....
<KuchikiYorume> Lagmobile: Well, I'm a tard >>
<rubenflonne> xD normal building in the middle of no where and you trust it
<rubenflonne> after you where being chased xD
<KuchikiYorume> Well, isn't that what you do in an anime?
<KuchikiYorume> It happens in Pokemon, too
<Lagmobile> STOP IT! dont OPEN that DOOR!
<KuchikiYorume> Now food?

<SuperBrony64> 31.5
<Ghosties> 04There is a red spy in Brony State
<Revolver> orz
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy, now the Bronies come out of the woodwork :/
<SuperBrony64> No love for Zoidberg huh?!
<Revolver> (V) (;,,;) (V)
<Revolver> I tried
<SuperBrony64> You attempted such a feat.
<SuperBrony64> I am proud of you.
<SuperBrony64> Someone is banging on the wall loudly outside.
<SuperBrony64> Not cool.
<Revolver> bitchslap them
*SuperBrony64 slaps wall
<SuperBrony64> Ow.
<SuperBrony64> It's not very effective...
<Diftraku> g'morning
<SuperBrony64> Good evening Diftraku!
<SuperBrony64> It's nearly nap time.
<SuperBrony64> But so much studying still needed...
<Diftraku> :3
<Diftraku> /engage twilightmode?
*SuperBrony64 engages Twilight Mode
<SuperBrony64> Twilight is best pony.
<Revolver> http://knowyourmeme.com/i/000/038/732/original/633673088039538329-nukethemfromorbit.jpg
<SuperBrony64> If I had a dollar for TWILIGHT IS THE BEST PONY, I'd have $!.
<SuperBrony64> And yes, I do mean $!
<Diftraku> lol
<SuperBrony64> For the lulz: http://youtu.be/f838ShhijgA
<SuperBrony64> And then…the sound…of silence.
<SuperBrony64> Grr…my door keeps opening by itself.
<SuperBrony64> So, what's everypony's favorite pony?
<SuperBrony64> Poor Hat :<
<SuperBrony64> *listens to Paper Mario music*
<SuperBrony64> And thus, someone is alive.
<SuperBrony64> You must have heard the Paper Mario music.
<Revolver> bleh
<Revolver> insomnia
<SuperBrony64> Don't worry, you all can listen to it too (SPOILER THOUGH FOR PAPER MARIO TTYD): http://youtu.be/nv5v5w-zxu4
<SuperBrony64> Revolver: Up all night thinking about coffee?
<Revolver> no
<Revolver> I hate coffee
<Revolver> well
<SuperBrony64> Well then. This conversation is over.
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Revolver> time for some multitasking of this and playing Fallout New Vegas
<SuperBrony64> You badass you :P
<SuperBrony64> Never played the Fallout series before...
<Revolver> and eating caramelcorn
<Revolver> ......
<Revolver> I don't know you anymore...
<SuperBrony64> Damn, lots of stuff I've never played/watched/done before...
<SuperBrony64> Haven't watched ANY of the Transformers movies / LotT
<SuperBrony64> Lord of the Rings*
<SuperBrony64> Haven't played through Modern Warfare 1 or 2 yet (but have both :P)
<SuperBrony64> But that's MAH LIFE. Hopefully when I have a job and bills I have to pay, THEN I can ignore those stuff and play video games :P
<Revolver> I can cause I'm only a senior in High School
<SuperBrony64> I can't cause I'm only a Senior in college :P
<SuperBrony64> But that's what Organic Chemistry II does to yah
<SuperBrony64> Among other things...
<Revolver> I took a collage level class before
<SuperBrony64> I've taken many a college level classes before :/
<Revolver> also
<Revolver> having an iPhone makes my AP Macronomics and Micronomics classes sooooooo much easier
<SuperBrony64> Really now? I took Introduction to Economics before, why does it make it easier? (To cheat on the tests? :P)
<Revolver> nah
<Revolver> don't have to write notes
<Revolver> I spend like half the class just doodling
<SuperBrony64> You just record the lectures?
<Revolver> nah
<SuperBrony64> You type the notes using the iPhone...?
<Revolver> my teacher just puts them on powerpoints and we discuss the stuff
<Revolver> I take pictures of the slides
<SuperBrony64> OHICNOW
<SuperBrony64> I tried doing that.
<SuperBrony64> But I felt like a weirdo for doing it.
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<Revolver> meh
<Revolver> it was worth it for me
<SuperBrony64> My professor just posted his lecture slides online anyway. So no problems there.
<SuperBrony64> But most importantly, every analogy would involve the use of alcohol or cigarettes in some form.
<SuperBrony64> So it was a pretty sweet class.
<Revolver> I'm sad cause I chose not to take geometry as a freshman so I'm not in AP Calculus and AP Physics right now QQ
<SuperBrony64> So? I took AP Calculus and AP Physics in my Senior year and I took geometry Freshman year.
<SuperBrony64> Oh wait
<SuperBrony64> Fail at reading.
<Revolver> and it was a kick in the face when I found out how easy geometry was
<SuperBrony64> You could take it anyway :P Geometry isn't that hard.
<SuperBrony64> Just draw a bunch of shapes and stuff.
<Revolver> basically
<SuperBrony64> But I hated geometry…with a passion...
<Revolver> although I won't get as many collage credits for taking AP Classes
<SuperBrony64> Algebra was always my forte.
<Revolver> yeah
<SuperBrony64> Equestria Daily is really on a roll tonight.
<Revolver> Algebra was my favorite
<SuperBrony64> Algebra > Geometry
<Revolver> although
<Revolver> I could of taken AP Statistics
<SuperBrony64> That would have sucked.
<Revolver> yeah
<SuperBrony64> I'm a genius at math, but Statistics was one of my hardest courses :P
<Revolver> My cousin was a year ahead of me so I knew what courses were good or not
<SuperBrony64> So much memorization.
<Revolver> als
<Revolver> *also
<Revolver> English was a fucking joke
<Revolver> I used it as a drawing class instead of actual english class
<SuperBrony64> Haha, that's what most of my fellow classmates did during my English class in High School.
<SuperBrony64> Professor knew she couldn't force the students into doing their work.
<SuperBrony64> They would go up to her the day a paper was due and ask for a 2 week extension, which she gave them.
<Revolver> all my teachers except my geometry teacher got that concept
<SuperBrony64> My grade in the class was like a 103% :3
<SuperBrony64> #1 spot for me! Number 3 had a 71%
<SuperBrony64> So you could see the flow of the class...
<SuperBrony64> Temlyn! Glad you could join us.
<SuperBrony64> Just talking about which Pony is best.
<Revolver> we were?
<SuperBrony64> You bet!
<SuperBrony64> The answer is Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> http://youtu.be/uES_r44ASck <3
*SuperBrony64 gets sleepy
<Diftraku> oh no you don't!
<SuperBrony64> YEAH I DID
<SuperBrony64> Ponies
<Diftraku> :3
<SuperBrony64> Dem thar ponies r teh besterest.
<SuperBrony64> I tell ya what.
<SuperBrony64> Moral of the story?
<SuperBrony64> Lithium Diisopropylamide removes a hydrogen from the alpha-carbon to proceed with an SN2 Reaction
<SuperBrony64> But with PONIES!!
<Sumica> Upgrade compleat!
<Diftraku> what upgrade?
<SuperBrony64> Took you long enough!
<SuperBrony64> What did you upgrade? :P
<SuperBrony64> Have you figured the secret to making this a reality? http://youtu.be/gNOdDxibeeU
<Sumica> My ISp finaly got around to geting my net upgrades
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy!
<SuperBrony64> HD Streams!
<Sumica> perhaps
<Diftraku> :3
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, cause HD was totally last year you know...
<SuperBrony64> It's not like I think it's cool or anything...
<Diftraku> i don't normally watch in hd, but when i do
<Diftraku> it's in uvhd
<Sumica> d- net to b+ net
<SuperBrony64> Wow amazing! You can't even VISUALLY PERCEIVE that much clarity.
<Sumica> is that like boasting 120fps?
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, Sumica you don't need to ban me over this or nothing…
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Sumica> when the parin cant even percive 60fps
<Sumica> so up for a test run?
<SuperBrony64> Sure.
<SuperBrony64> Stream this in HD: http://youtu.be/5NylmdC_uEM
<SuperBrony64> For the record...
<SuperBrony64> I choose the Rarity room
<SuperBrony64> Somehow that extra 'o' slipped in there...
<SuperBrony64> Also for the record, the screen you are streaming is black. But it is crystal clear black.
<Sumica> my that was stupid
<Sumica> no seems they swaped streems on me again.
<SuperBrony64> :<
<SuperBrony64> It's cool, I didn't need friendship motivation to get me by today...
<SuperBrony64> IT'S FINE
*Sumica is so out of the loop
*Trollestia is further out.
<SuperBrony64> Nah it's cool, we're still friends :P
<SuperBrony64> But about that test stream…still not happening
<SuperBrony64> Octavia doesn't approve.
<SuperBrony64> Which stream are you using? The main room and back up streams don't work.
<SuperBrony64> Or in other words, they WORK but nothing is being streamed.
<Sumica> dont know if I have the back up publish info and main stream is giving faild to publish errors
<SuperBrony64> That's weird. Want me to test it out myself? :3
<SuperBrony64> What's up TTG?
<TTG> What's going on in here?
<SuperBrony64> Ponies and lots of 'em.
<SuperBrony64> What's your favorite color?
<TTG> Hm, my comp says the broadcast is offline. Is it?
<TTG> Or is my comp just shit? (note: it is)
<Sumica> Feh, so either someone forgot to stop brodcasting or it's the stream host acting up.
<SuperBrony64> No real broadcast, just performin' tests.
<TTG> k
<SuperBrony64> DCD was streaming earlier.
<TTG> Uh, green btw
<SuperBrony64> That must be it, he said he was setting up his computer to stream till like 4 AM
<SuperBrony64> Whatever time zone that was...
<SuperBrony64> Green is not a very creative color TTG...
<Sumica> Some day I will get ahold of this Murphy guy and when i do I will beat the ever livving hell out of him.
<SuperBrony64> Lots of Ping timeouts...
<TTG> There are like a bazillion different plants out there
<TTG> most are green
<TTG> I'd say it can be imaginative when it needs to be
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As8cmHb-aKU
<Sumica> here pretend this is the stream.
<SuperBrony64> Lulz okay.
<SuperBrony64> Stream isn't very high quality :P
<Sumica> it is a test mind you =p
<SuperBrony64> 240p all your internet can do?
<SuperBrony64> My TOASTER can achieve that resolution.
<Sumica> hey it was filmed with a potato.
<SuperBrony64> Over a DIAL-UP network
<TTG> If it's shiny and you hold a video phone to it, maybe
<SuperBrony64> While ON THE PHONE
<SuperBrony64> Well, a potato is slightly better.
<SuperBrony64> Especially cut up and fried...mmm...
<SuperBrony64> Where were we again?
<Sumica> I am here, I have no clue where you are.
<SuperBrony64> WHO ARE YOU?!
<SuperBrony64> And how do you know where you are...
<TTG> Nyeah... the target.
<Sumica> I ahve one of those little map things with the arrow saying you are here.
<SuperBrony64> This panic is what comes about having to study for a quiz that happens tomorrow at 9 AM which I have no knowledge of the material.
<SuperBrony64> Also bad grammarz.
<TTG> Download it into your brain
<TTG> I know kung fu
<SuperBrony64> TTG: Can't, some crazy video is being played over the stream. Hogging up all my bandwidth with its' 240p rich content.
<Sumica> sleep with the textbook under your pellow, learn via osmoses.
<TTG> dang
<SuperBrony64> I'd like to learn via RAINBOW DASH.
<TTG> microwave the book first
<TTG> heat rises
<Sumica> good point
<SuperBrony64> TTG: MICROWAVES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
<TTG> And if you get too warm from the book, make sure you have a windmill nearby to cool you down
<SuperBrony64> Good thinking TTG!
<SuperBrony64> I'M HACKING THIS STREAM!
<SuperBrony64> http://youtu.be/2XtoP4kucy4
<Sumica> zomg hax
<TTG> watching that machina you posted earlier
<Sumica> dari is so gonna ban you when he gets up
<SuperBrony64> That's only if the sun RISES!
<SuperBrony64> Luna's got mah back :P
<TTG> It's thoroughly disorienting for G-man to have such a normal voice
<Sumica> btw i so called it when I said new eps on the 15th.
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: I'm sure you did.
<Sumica> Well that's cause he's not "g-man" it's Mr smith =p
<TTG> If that's what he's gonna call himself, anyway
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, I'm sure we can all agree that Fluttershy is the best pony.
<Sumica> feh
*Trollestia doesn't take kindly to such blasphemy.
<SuperBrony64> I'm glad you agree!
<Sumica> Screwball is best pony
<SuperBrony64> That is not the consensus that I just proposed.
<TTG> Eh, I love them all, and my fave varies from episode to episode, but overall, I really like Twi
<SuperBrony64> /setsnewtopic
<SuperBrony64> Twilight is best pony.
<Sumica> All i know is pinkiy needs to stay the hell out of my dreams.
<Sumica> I have a hard enough time sleeping when sick.
<SuperBrony64> But…she's best Pony :<
<Sumica> but if she keeps doing those things I makes it even harder to stay asleep.
<SuperBrony64> But you're lucky to have Pinkie Pie in your dreams...
<TTG> Pinkiy Pih
<SuperBrony64> I don't really get the chance to have nice dreams...
<TTG> Are these terrifying "Hi! I watch you watching me!" dreams, or
<SuperBrony64> Maybe if I focus more on the ponies and less on studying...
<TTG> like, cupcakes dreams
<Sumica> 4th wall stuff
<TTG> or sexy, sexy, pinkie lovin's dreams
<SuperBrony64> Where does 'sexy, sexy, pinkie lovin's dreams' come into play?
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B9-TQVXYpM
<Trollestia> lawl
<TTG> Is that just me, then?
<SuperBrony64> DO HOHOHO a lurkers crawls out from the woodwork.
<SuperBrony64> Someone has been spying on us.
<Trollestia> liek a baws
<Trollestia> Nah, I was AFK
<Sumica> more anoyed i have to be sick and heavly dossed to even have pony dreams.
<TTG> Hey, play that George Michael song, you know, "naaaaa nanana"
<SuperBrony64> This is where the magic happens: http://youtu.be/jy8GyQaFUUo
<SuperBrony64> Since when is it National Pony Writing Month?
<TTG> NaPoWriMo?
<Trollestia> That's a thing now?
<SuperBrony64> This is now the new stream: http://youtu.be/bmxyd6co6Qw
<TTG> Dash, what are you-....
<TTG> I...
<Sumica> oh one of those.
<SuperBrony64> Any requests for stream?
<Sumica> "No﻿ wingboner, she's faking it!"
<SuperBrony64> Dash is an expert, she knows when to 'hide her thing'.
<SuperBrony64> She's playing hard to get…but still coming closer to us...
<TTG> lmao, there's a Big Mac one
<TTG> It's pretty half-assed though, rough vector, it's only a minute long
*Trollestia is disappoint.
<Sumica> must be some one trying to coppy.
<SuperBrony64> Seems like someone dared to click the link...
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3r77uYTNrJ4#!
<SuperBrony64> Uggh, great, now THIS is on the stream...
<Sumica> some great songs though
<TTG> SAFETY DANCE LOL
<SuperBrony64> Best one was Dexter. PERIOD.
<Sumica> indeed
<Sumica> DD is best pony =p
<SuperBrony64> YOUR ARGUMENT IS TRUE YET INVALID AT THE SAME TIME
<SuperBrony64> http://youtu.be/05Uke7NF_Rc
<SuperBrony64> The previous link is a true statement.
<SuperBrony64> Oh man…what a waste
<Sumica> Oh did he fix the 5min of dead air video?
<SuperBrony64> The video is REALLY only a minute long
<SuperBrony64> That was a glitch in the mainframe
<SuperBrony64> I apologize for the inconvenience.
<Sumica> nope, seems his dad needs to whip his as some more.
<SuperBrony64> But you will need to suffer through the four minutes of darkness.
<SuperBrony64> But…I is confused...
<SuperBrony64> This solves the confusion: http://youtu.be/tk-cziBPTNU
<Sumica> that video would so be on my trollen playlist right up there with sugger cubes and seaponies.
<Sumica> TOOOOOOOOT!
<SuperBrony64> YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
<SuperBrony64> TTG! Go and paint the MIND ROOM!
<Sumica> wait seth only just posted that whos line video. Slacker I sent that video to him ages ago.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=S2nvTO6bRW8#!
<MantisToboggan> http://i.imgur.com/Wz7FL.gif
<SuperBrony64> Here's a trollin video: http://youtu.be/ntIFhbtmwCc

<SuperBrony64> The hell am I looking at MantisToboggan?!
<MantisToboggan> a centi-belle

<Sumica> yeah I think that's on our playlist already.
<TTG> Guh. @ Sweetie Centipede
<Sumica> btw numa numa meens do not want do not want.
<Trollestia> lawl
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: The more you know!
<SuperBrony64> I think 'Sexy Naughty Bitchy Rarity' fits the mentality of Rarity PERFECTLY!
<Trollestia> Nah. Good PMV, though.
<Sumica> which is realy funny cause the Korian version of ep 3 vaider screams DO NOT WANT in the subtittles at the end instead of NOOOOOOO cause they dont have a way of draking out NOOOOOO.
<TTG> o.o
<Trollestia> lmao
*SuperBrony64 's mind is gone...
<SuperBrony64> Brain is got the dumbs..
<TTG> It was a bootleg caption job from china or something that was making the rounds a few years back
<TTG> there were some great lines in there but DO NOT WANT hit critical meme mass fast and hard
<TTG> Now everyone uses variants of that meme
<SuperBrony64> Time for mind to shut down...
<TTG> "Sort of want"
<SuperBrony64> Good night everypony! Excellent stream tonight Sumica :P
<Trollestia> Do want.
<Sumica> heh
<TTG> I've been working and plowing so long that
<TTG> even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
<Sumica> wtf, ok people around here are crazy.
<Sumica> there is currently a paintball war taking place at my apartment.
<TTG> wut
<Sumica> people are outside shooting at eachother with paintball guns.
<Sumica> like in the carpark.
<Sumica> if they hit my car I am grabing my spaz and rocksalt rounds.
<Sumica> I should be trying to sleep. but now I am all wound up.
<NewDCD> oh wow since when was that scan running?
<LordCelestia> Hi everyone
<LordCelestia> nevermind, nobodys on. hehe

<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE7CVCuMz0 <-- Have a little match girl.
<Dermathil> heyall
<Dermathil> back from studying a forums that didn't seem to have been touched by bronydom
<MeteorVenture> there's a forum i think i'm gonna be the first to post about ponies on lol
<MeteorVenture> just haven't done it yet
<Diftraku> g'afternoon
<Dermathil> hehehe the forums that I studied actually did get bronified
<Dermathil> just that the threads went inactive
<Diftraku> Did you read the nightly roundup on EqD?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Diftraku> Nevar forget!
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE7CVCuMz0 <-- Have a little match girl, Dermathil.
<MeteorVenture> that ponychan crawler thing aint working.. any ideas why?
<MeteorVenture> it just starts trying to download a thread and then says done after apparently loading the thread or something.. as if it's not detecting any pictures whatsoever
<Diftraku> bad regex?
<MeteorVenture> dunno what regex is lol
<MeteorVenture> well ok i dunno how it applies here anyway
<Diftraku> Is it ot just getting any data from ponychan or just failing to read what it's getting?
<MeteorVenture> what happens is the "downloading thread" message and then immediately after that just "done!"
<MeteorVenture> everything seems normal except that it's just not actually downloading anything
<MeteorVenture> except the thread.. it does take time to load that
<MeteorVenture> but right after it does it's just "done!"
<Turgle> hi RP :)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay Turgle
<Diftraku> Ohai Turgle
<Diftraku> And RobotPinkie
<Turgle> Hey Diftraku :D

<WhatPayne> Hello from me too to everyone
<WhatPayne> Day is cloudy, but mood is sunny
<Turgle> i'm burning my fingers with a soldering iron! xD
<MeteorVenture> i am just gonna guess that ponychan changed and it needs to be updated
<WhatPayne> Hm what's going on in the ponychan?
<MeteorVenture> this ponychan image crawler thing aint saving images
<MeteorVenture> back to not having a luxury that i've grown fond of possibly
<Turgle> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131220853848.jpg
<WhatPayne> The what crawler?
<Turgle> discuss
<WhatPayne> Aaah! Why would anyone post that?
<Turgle> xD
<MeteorVenture> for fun and profit
<DashWithRainbows> whats up guys?
<DashWithRainbows> i think my school's internet has became somewhat better, it only took me a few seconds to connect
<Turgle> Hi Dash :]
<DashWithRainbows> hey Turgle
<MeteorVenture> anyway what it does is saves all the images in whatever thread you specify (or just on a whole board over all pages if you don't) and it deletes duplicates as well
<MeteorVenture> dat luxury
<DashWithRainbows> man i love Maoam's
<MeteorVenture> rainbow dash always dresses like guile
<DashWithRainbows> listening to She's a pony (fucking best song i have heard so far)
<DashWithRainbows> pretty much what i have been doing in all my lessons and my lunch break

<MeteorVenture> i experienced enjoyment out of this comic
<WhatPayne> It's funny becuase it's plausible
<Turgle> ^
<MeteorVenture> lol i'm pretty much just like the dude in the comic except my mom isn't like that lol.. she wouldn't question it
<EspyLacopa> Someone needs to take over a Home Economics Class via Pinkie Pie.
<MeteorVenture> except for 1 thing.. i don't like madonna.. in fact i'm opposed to her music just for no memorable reason
<MeteorVenture> oh and i don't have a pony desktop.. yet.. and i've never had a phone
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol that comic
<MeteorVenture> or wallpaper or whatever you kids call it nowadays
<EspyLacopa> He just likes his ponies and rainbows.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't have a pony wallpaper
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have TWO pony wallpapers
<WhatPayne> So I just fixed my Blind Bag RD's eyes.
<EspyLacopa> I have nightmare moon background, nightmare moon chrome theme, and luna mouse pointers.
<EspyLacopa> And I use that shiny black windows theme, royale noir.
<MeteorVenture> i do however have minecraft lol
<WhatPayne> http://fav.me/d4b9gz4
<DashWithRainbows> and im back, computer crashed on me...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I especially like my XMB themes on my PS3... so much pony...
<MeteorVenture> that is awesome payne
<Turgle> WhatPayne, you did that?
<Turgle> it's awesome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Very cool, though.... what did they look like before? :P
<DashWithRainbows> wish i could see that image... website is blocked -_-
<WhatPayne> Yes I did that. The stock eyes were so, ehh...
<WhatPayne> http://fav.me/d4b37rr old eyes
<EspyLacopa> Why is the light and angle between the two shots so different?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oooh, nice job
<WhatPayne> What?
<EspyLacopa> I can't tell just how much you changed.
<WhatPayne> http://fav.me/d4b37rr diferent angle
<Turgle> witch material did you use?
<WhatPayne> The diference is because the pictures were taken on diferent days.
<EspyLacopa> Your improved model is in much darker light, and is more toward the front of the figure.
<WhatPayne> http://fav.me/d4b9i68 Better?
<EspyLacopa> Ah, yup
<EspyLacopa> Ahhh, you changed the eye shape.
<EspyLacopa> See, I had initially thought you changed the eye color.
<WhatPayne> No the colour was right. Just made the eye bigger and gave it the "squint" is more akin RD's persona
<WhatPayne> Turgle, I actually used inkjet waterslide decal paper.
<FreezeFrame> Now that the internet at campus isn't dropping me every half hour, I'm back.
<WhatPayne> Similar stuff used for model airplane decals.
<Turgle> oh, now i got it
<Turgle> thanks
<WhatPayne> But you know for inkjet printers
<WhatPayne> I actually learned about it from now old Ponychan thread that was about the Celestia figure repainting and customization.

<LunaTheForgotten> I never really liked Red Bull.
*EspyLacopa prefers root beer.
<Rainbow-Dash> I tried root beer one time
<Rainbow-Dash> It was the most awful thing I ever tasted
<Revolver> I like it because I find coffee too bitter
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<Rainbow-Dash> Maybe it was just because I was younger
<EspyLacopa> Fun part with root beer is that all the brands for it taste different.
<Rainbow-Dash> Orly
<LunaTheForgotten> Root beer is pretty good when it is made by Virgil's.
<Revolver> Root beer is ok
<prince-dari> I have no idea what root beer is, but ginger beer is the shit.
<EspyLacopa> So I always find it interesting to see what a particular brand or make of root beer tastes like.
<gingerale> :I
*LunaTheForgotten brohoofs Daei
<LunaTheForgotten> *Dari
*prince-dari brohoofs LunaTheForgotten

<Revolver> Like arizon tea?
<prince-dari> LAWL
<LunaTheForgotten> I found it in my grandparents basement.
<Revolver> *Arizona
<CloudRunner> My soul feels shattered...
<EspyLacopa> Ginger beer sounds tasty
<LunaTheForgotten> Arizona tea is amazing.
<prince-dari> MFW direct quote from Seth: "You even annoy me! And I'm the scourge of 3+ spyro forums!"
<prince-dari> That is hilarious.
<Suinide> Hmmm
<EspyLacopa> prince-dari: Do you go for fermented or carbonated ginger beer?
<Revolver> That it is
<Revolver> Because you are a giant English troll prince-Dari
<prince-dari> EspyLacopa: I've never tried alcoholic ginger beer, so carbonated.
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<EspyLacopa> A good second for favorite drink is some tasty apple cider.
<prince-dari> Though I've had ginger cider before.
<prince-dari> As in proper cider.
<Dermathil> hey Prince-dari
<prince-dari> Not weird American non-alcohlic cider.
<LunaTheForgotten> Brb, gonna jump in shower.
<Revolver> I haven't had Ginger beer before
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Revolver> But I've had alcoholic cider before
<prince-dari> Cider is fermented apples, non-alcoholic cider, wut.
<prince-dari> Sense not make.
<Revolver> Well
<Revolver> I'm in America
<Revolver> So that's normal here
<FlaschenJoe11> Hello

<Revolver> Have you ever been to Ireland
<prince-dari> Nope.

<NewDCD> 9 Sadfrog.jpg
<Dermathil> hahahaha
<EspyLacopa> You talking about the one at 0:22?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I like your Wyburn design, NewDCD. You should ink and color it, seriously
<RobotPinkie> 06,15also all my rage when I discover the only checkpoints in ICO are when you save....
<EspyLacopa> So, is this the digimon series that shall pierce the heavens?
<MrPoniator> It's the digimon series where they just add glowy armor and spikes since they ran out more plausible ideas
<EspyLacopa> And bigger chests.
<MrPoniator> Also, goggles
<EspyLacopa> Digimon always has goggles.
<EspyLacopa> It's how you can tell who the main character is. He's got goggles.
<MrPoniator> Since those goggles can change shape and form over time when passed down through generations
<EspyLacopa> Though I suppose it may be possible, sometime down the road, for the Goggles to be owned by a girl. . .
<MrPoniator> Le gasp!
<EspyLacopa> Since technically, the first series had a girl with goggles (Sora)
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAlxqBJprVI
<AllisZero> You're pretty good, DCD
<AllisZero> Those are nice
<AllisZero> Also WB Rp
<EspyLacopa> Oh, wait, no, Sora didn't have goggles.
<EspyLacopa> She just had a silly hat.

<RobotPinkie> 06,15...eh, close enough
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Trying out new Minecraft 1.9 prerelease... got kinda pissed off at ICO.
<EspyLacopa> Oh? What'd Ico do?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I just don't feel like replaying 20 minutes of the game right now :P
<EspyLacopa> Oh, died before you had a chance to save?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not really "chance", I didn't think the game had zero checkpoints.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15If I'd known, I could've gone back and saved.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Instead I solved every puzzle in the area, only to fall to my death. Not a smart move :P
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the dreaded bottomless pit.
<AllisZero> ICO?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15puzzle platformer for the PS2, they just released the HD version on PS3
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Great game, except the fighting is kinda crap.
<MrPoniator> I don wonder when the heck The Last Guardian is coming out
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know it's been pushed back to 2012
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm guessing holiday 2012, since they're saying spring :P
<NewDCD> 9 Back from McD's...got Rainbow Dash. They didn't have Pinkie. Unless the Pony toys are still sold next week, I won't get Pinkie D: she's the only one missing from my set
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Aw damn...
<NewDCD> well
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wonder if they have the pony Happy Meal toys here
<prince-dari> MFW still no pony toys at all in McD here.
<prince-dari> They've never had them.
<NewDCD> 9at least I have my Top 3 instead of my Top 4 but still
<NewDCD> 9 dari our poni toys are different
<NewDCD> 9they light up and shit
<prince-dari> The US has had both the light up ones and the normal ones. :/
<prince-dari> We've had neither.
<NewDCD> 9really? US has had both in such a short time?
<NewDCD> 9 I understood the light-up ones were LatAm exclusive
<Rainbow-Dash> NewDCD, where does MCD have Pony toys again?
<NewDCD> 9 To my understanding, Latin America
<Rainbow-Dash> Ahh, I see
<NewDCD> 9at least from my understanding of the LatAm Brony /int/ threads
<RobotPinkie> 06,15They look kinda robotic

<MeteorVenture> helpful as the bass ponies..?
<Quaraezha> Anypony here?
<Quaraezha> I just received awesome news from Season 2 :V
<FlaschenJoe11> really?
<Quaraezha> yeah, inside information :V
<Quaraezha> I have lots actually ;D
<LunaTheForgotten> O'RLY!
<Quaraezha> Like why Episode 3 is moved, why the new intro starts at Episode 3
<Quaraezha> that's right :D
<Quaraezha> Speaking of new intros.
<Quaraezha> In the Season 1 intro, you could see big mac in the background
<Quaraezha> but with Caramel's color (brown) and cutie mark (horseshoes)
<Quaraezha> in the new Season 2 intro, he's now corrected :D
<Quaraezha> The Cutie Mark Crusaders are also now included in the new Intro :V
<Rainbow-Dash> Link to the new intro? I didnt notice any differences..
<Quaraezha> No links yet.
<Quaraezha> But there IS a screenshot
<Rainbow-Dash> Orly
<Rainbow-Dash> PM it to me?
<Quaraezha> Also, the scroll that is presented to Celestia in the end of the intro
<Quaraezha> is now glowing with a Golden color
<LunaTheForgotten> That sounds like an epic new intro.
<Quaraezha> it IS.
<Quaraezha> anyway,
<Quaraezha> you guys know what Photo Finish' Cutie mark is? :V
<LunaTheForgotten> I didn't know it ever showed it.
<Quaraezha> it did
<Quaraezha> but only for a frame
<Quaraezha> http://arch.413chan.net/photo_finish_cutie_mark-(n1300777195794).png
<Quaraezha> oh derp'd link. just copypasta it or somethin
<LunaTheForgotten> :O
<prince-dari> Animation derp?
<Quaraezha> So yeah, as you can see. It's obviously Twilight's Cutie Mark
<Quaraezha> yeah, you could say it's an animation derp
<Quaraezha> To explain why it's like that
<Quaraezha> They used Twilight Sparkle's body as a template for Photo Finish
<Quaraezha> My friend (who works for MLP) checked it out
<Quaraezha> He remove her shades and hair
<Quaraezha> and you can obviously see Twilight's face
<Quaraezha> http://bit.ly/mQD5cz
<Quaraezha> btw don't leak. lol
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> so
<Turgle> in your opinion
<Quaraezha> ?
<Turgle> they just draw photofinish ON twilight?
<Quaraezha> Yep, pretty much.
<Quaraezha> they probably hid a few features
<Quaraezha> and drew over it
<Turgle> i don't think they did
<Turgle> they use a basic palette
<Turgle> and from that they draw a new element
<Quaraezha> That's how it's suppose to go
<Quaraezha> but I honeslty have no idea why they used Twilight as their template for Pony Gaga
<MrChang> greetings everypony
<FlaschenJoe11> hey
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey MrChang
<MrChang> i love you all
<Quaraezha> <3
<LunaTheForgotten> We love you too.
<MrChang> except quaraezha
<Turgle> anyway i still think they didnt use twilight template
<Quaraezha> :<
<Quaraezha> But that's the only explaination as to why
<Quaraezha> Photo has her cutie Mark
<Quaraezha> AND face.
<MrChang> just kidding
<Quaraezha> <3
<prince-dari> Well, I believe you anyway Quaraezha. XD
<Quaraezha> ohoho :D
<Quaraezha> hey hey
<Quaraezha> Give me a number
<prince-dari> So much stuff gets reused, I wouldn't be surprised by them resuing one of the models.
<Quaraezha> and I'll tell you what the episode title is
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> 15
<Quaraezha> not 15, i only know 1-14
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<prince-dari> 12
<Turgle> xD
<Quaraezha> Episode 15 has something to do with Cider, however
<Quaraezha> yeah, Cider
<Quaraezha> that alcholoic drink
<Quaraezha> in a kid's show.
<prince-dari> XD
<Quaraezha> OH DARN
<Quaraezha> The title of Episode 12 is a big giveaway
<Quaraezha> to what's it about
<prince-dari> Ok, 7?
<Quaraezha> promise don't tell anypony :V
<Quaraezha> i can't have leaked information in EqD or whatever
<prince-dari> Ok, well I don't want you to get into trouble.
<Quaraezha> might fire an animator for leaks :V
<Quaraezha> anyway
<prince-dari> So it's best you don't post it. :P
<prince-dari> Fail.
<prince-dari> Ok, well I don't want you to get into trouble.
<prince-dari> So it's best you don't post it. :P
<Quaraezha> lol
<prince-dari> to get you*
<Quaraezha> nah, 'tis fine :V
<Quaraezha> Episode 12: Baby Cakes
<prince-dari> Hey Val.

<AllisZero> How difficult is it to make Windows answer to a goddamn fax
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm guessing pretty hard.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> long time no see gaiz what's up?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Hai gaiz! long time no see!
<MeteorVenture> not much but i'm having some fun on YT
*FreezeFrame is doing his Legacy challenge in Sims 3
<MeteorVenture> someone said kids are born racist.. i decided to say the exact opposite and then say "so we're even" and then they said science said otherwise and i said "science does not say otherwise.. so we're even"
<MeteorVenture> i wonder what will happen next
<FreezeFrame> And rememberin that the rules make it so you can't actually have a house for at least a week.
<MeteorVenture> lol i've never played the sims but that sounds strategic
<FreezeFrame> Basically, you start with a single sim, and go through 10 generations. You have to start on the largest lot so that your sims start with only 1800 simoleons

<TGnP_Flaria> ;~;
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> Flaria, you need to roll your R's a bit more
<TGnP_Flaria> What am I, hispanic?
*Diftraku whimpers in a corner and rocks back and forth: "There's jersey shore on my Youtube frontpage..."
<Flaria> ... sorry if that was racist, everypony. u.u
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> no but Trixie did that GRrrreat and Powerrfull TRrrIXIE
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> thingy
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> at least I heard it that way
<AllisZero> I'm not hispanic and I take offense to that
<Flaria> AllisZero: .____.
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> Jersey Shore must be DESTROYED!!
<AllisZero> I also take offense to people's happiness
<AllisZero> And couples in the mall
<AllisZero> So don't you worry!
<Diftraku> Youtube's been wonky for some reason
<TwilightSparkleJoe11> And Ice-Cream
<Flaria> Oh.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I take offense to anything that's not pony
*Flaria hugs RobotPinkie
<Edward_Newgate> TGIJ

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Francis talks about ponies?
*Flaria huggles AllisZero and swings him around in circles
<AllisZero> This week flew by, jeez
*DashWithRainbows explodes as it is jersday
<Flaria> Francis can't hate ponies. :l
<Diftraku> AllisZero: It sure did
<Diftraku> Must be because of S2E3 next week
<Diftraku> So this week is unimportant
<AllisZero> Next week no
<AllisZero> The week after that
<FlaschenJoe11> I'm allowed to make fun of Photo Finish's german (at least I think it is german) accent, since I'm german myself
<Diftraku> Thefug
<AllisZero> Yeah... October 15th mang
<VioletVanilla> 06Ja Flaschen, sie ist~
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Makes sense
<FlaschenJoe11> That's an evil plot by Cartoon Network to destroy The Hub and regain it's viewers
<VioletVanilla> 06Pinkie~
<AllisZero> What does Cartoon Network have of valuable nowadays
<AllisZero> Thundercats?
<AllisZero> Eh...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You gotta stand up tall
<FlaschenJoe11> also Lex Luthor just stole forty cakes
<FlaschenJoe11> that's 40
<AllisZero> Only cartoon besides FiM I really like is Phineas and Ferb
<FlaschenJoe11> as many as 4 tens
<VioletVanilla> 06As much as 4 tens
<VioletVanilla> 06and that is just terrible
<FlaschenJoe11> And that's terrible
<VioletVanilla> 06NIIINJAAAAA
<AllisZero> >LEX LUTHOR
<AllisZero> You're like the richest man in Metropolis. Can't you just buy some cakes?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love Courage the Cowardly Dog
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and Invader Zim is pretty good
<EspyLacopa> Courage vs Zim?
<AllisZero> Well I mean, stuff that's current RP
<VioletVanilla> 06Dextar's Lab. ;3
<FlaschenJoe11> HE'S ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN THE DC UNIVERSE!! WHY DOESN'T HE JUST BUY THEM!!!
<EspyLacopa> Think of the crossover potential.
<Edward_Newgate> >Invader Zim
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, okay, then it makes more sense :P
<Edward_Newgate> >Only pretty good
<Edward_Newgate> >mfw

<RobotPinkie> 06,15FiM is pretty much my favorite cartoon of all time, though...
<Flaria> ^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not even nostalgia can beat FiM
<DashWithRainbows> same here RP, but before that it was Ed, Edd n Eddy for me
<AllisZero> I think so too
<AllisZero> Well, actually, sorry
<Edward_Newgate> Ed, Edd, n Eddy
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm back.
<AllisZero> I think Swat Kats takes that cake for me
<Flaria> I have a few Anime's I hold in a slightly higher regard, but that's just because of what they've done to me, not their content.
<Edward_Newgate> Now THAT was creepy
<AllisZero> WB LTF
<AllisZero> Same, Flaria.
<LunaTheForgotten> What are you guys talking about?
<Flaria> Hiya LunaTheForgotten~
<AllisZero> Favorite cartoons, shows, etc
<Flaria> ^
<FlaschenJoe11> Hi LTF
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys.
<FlaschenJoe11> TTGL for myself
<MeteorVenture> MLP:FiM is my favorite.. what's yalls?
<VioletVanilla> 06Cowboy Bebop rocked me from Saxony to Stuttgart~ <3
<EspyLacopa> Transformers: Beast Wars
<LunaTheForgotten> My favourite used to be Kenan And Kel,or Doug.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Out of all shows, animes, cartoons?
<Flaria> TTGL, S-Cry-Ed...
<Flaria> Champloo.
<MeteorVenture> ooh s-cry-ed
<FlaschenJoe11> STUTTGART IST VIEL SCHÖNER ALS BERLIN (Stuttgart is much prettier than Berlin)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15omfg S-Cry-ed, so damn awesome
<EspyLacopa> I clump cartoon and anime into one category, cartoons.
<Flaria> EspyLacopa: Oh you.
*Flaria hugs EspyLacopa
<Dashite> Needs more Reboot
<CriticKitten> Howdy y'all
<LunaTheForgotten> No I take back what I said.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have to agree with EspyLacopa, really...
<LunaTheForgotten> My FAVORITE was ORIGINAL Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
<EspyLacopa> Reboot disappointed me when they cut off the series with a crazy Megabyte in invading the central place of Mainframe.
<Flaria> I keep them apart since they usually never cross topics.
<Edward_Newgate> The comicbook?
<CriticKitten> I agree with most of those, but must also put forward Animaniacs and Batman The Animated Series for obvious reasons.
<EspyLacopa> After all the crazy net adventures they had.
<Edward_Newgate> Can't forget about Freakazoid either
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O292KICg8_s

<VioletVanilla> 06Ja, aber Saxony ist die Schönste~ ;D
<Diftraku> Dat be awesome
<AllisZero> I always held Animu in a higher regard than cartoons because rarely a cartoon had comparable quality...
<AllisZero> Until FiM.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15They very frequently cross topics, I think... The biggest difference is that in Japan more TV-cartoons are aimed at adults.
<MeteorVenture> you were saying flaria? http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4507/inter-for.11/0_383ab_9a2f5f57_XL.jpg
<Flaria> MeteorVenture: RRRRRRRGH
*Flaria hugs Luna
<AllisZero> Then that perception was shattered
<FlaschenJoe11> VioletVanilla Du a saxe?
<EspyLacopa> Also, it's the older-targeted japanese cartoons that typically get exported from Japan.
<MeteorVenture> lol that ship is just bad enough to make me consider rage as a viable option
<VioletVanilla> 06Ja, aus Dresden (:
<AllisZero> The majority of anime series actually has teens and young adults as the target, with the obvious exceptions of course
<AllisZero> (I mean, Shounen and Seinen kinda tell it all)
<LunaTheForgotten> I never really watched anime.
<FlaschenJoe11> BartSaku is OTP!!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Myeah

<herospirit> background....
*Flaria brohoofs herospirit
<herospirit> and Locust.... and stuff
<Flaria> Background? What's that?
<herospirit> Well, Cole Train is shooting his gonna without looking in the direction he's firing,
<herospirit> So it must be hitting SOMETHING
<herospirit> That's why I need Locust.
<herospirit> :0
<Flaria> Ahh
<FlaschenJoe11> LOL
<Flaria> Yay~!
<Flaria> ... this is so much better with the spotlights
<herospirit> Though he's firing it kinda downwards, so maybe it's just victory fire. :I
<DashWithRainbows> anyone else sound making a small cracking sound?
<Luna> 07,01yep
<WhatPayne> yup
<interior_gummy> so, 3 memes created by the first episode-discord shuffle, scootaloo is a dodo, and chocolate rain
