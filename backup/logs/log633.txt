<Applejack2012> I was born in 1973
<mitamaking> wow

<Vivix> My fondest memories of the 90s are asphalt and roses smell, gastation buying cheap gum with powerranger stickers, and riding a bike to Grandma's house

<Obsidian> Oh Hello FlutterMEDIC
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Hello!
<tSparx|BnF> FlutterMEDIC: I thought you were already here :)
<tSparx|BnF> FlutterMEDIC: Wb!
<thelonepony> hai CCCP
<CCCP> hello tSparx|BnF :) and AJIsAwesome
<FlutterMEDIC> i left awhile ago
<CCCP> hey thelonepony!
<Applejack2012> hi flutter
<MirrorImage> so was that an intentional backflip or did the mine blast you back to do that?
<FlutterMEDIC> i still love that little thing i found on a website
<FlutterMEDIC> you guys want to see it?
<Vivix> Maybe, what is it?
<RainbowDash90> o30
<FlutterMEDIC> it involves Ponies
<RainbowDash90> meep
<Pikachu> I hope paintool is free :l
<Cades> yeah haha, same thing happened to me when i looked at my phone. im like "why is the quality so good? lol"
<RainbowDash90> moop
<Vivix> Pikachu, it is not, but it is cheap. 70 bucks
<RainbowDash90> hi al
<Canadian_Brony> hi RainbowDash90
<Obsidian> Hello RainbowDash90
<Wrek> 05Pikachu: it isnt
<Wrek> 05but its cheap for drawing software standards
<Byakuya> 6xD
<alexxm> how you doing RainbowDash90
<Wrek> 0560ish bucks iirc
<Canadian_Brony> that is cheap
<MirrorImage> when the alternative is Photoshop in the 300+ range?
<FlutterMEDIC> go here: http://www.railslove.com/ then press: Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Enter (the Konami Code) for a surprise
<Vivix> it is
<MirrorImage> yeah, i'd say so
<Applejack2012> good evening
<Vivix> Photoshop is very expensive, and not really direceted at the drawing crowd
<Pikachu> Well thats alot of money for me O_o hmm i dont care i still going to have 200 bucks on meh b day XD
<RainbowDash90> im tired but ok alex
<Byakuya> 6I hope you can get it fixed so you won't need safe mode anymore x)
<Vivix> Painter 11 is directed at same crowd as Painttool, and costs--350 or osmething
<tSparx|BnF> There's also GIMP, which I know isn't perfect, but has been used to produce some wonderful art
<Applejack2012> i use ginp
<Cades> lol thx
<Applejack2012> gimp
<MirrorImage> tSparx|BnF - i prefer Paint.NET personally
<Vivix> yeah there's good free stuff
<HoodyNinja> I dont know how to draw!
<Vivix> I don't like paint.net because none of my controls work on it
<Cades> i posted a question on yahoo answers yesterday, but of course nobodies answered yet *facepalm*
<Vivix> cltr-alt-space and shuch-
<MirrorImage> what controls?
<tSparx|BnF> MirrorImage: That's a good alternative too. I don't do much stuff in the visual arts, and GIMP is more than sufficient for me :)
<Canadian_Brony> I write and act. I don't draw.
<AJIsAwesome> I can draw, but not very well......:(
<Pikachu> Tsparx: good i have gmip on my computor wich has a mic bbut im tool lazy to swicht computor :l ill just download it
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Vivix> zoom rotate move stuff shortcuts
<Applejack2012> I write more
<HoodyNinja> damnit AJIsAwesome
<Pikachu> *but
<Canadian_Brony> anything I do draw isn't anything fanceh
<tSparx|BnF> Honestly, MS Paint is usually fine for me :)
<MirrorImage> you could probably find a plugin that adds those shortcuts
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: What is it?
*HoodyNinja sigh...
<HoodyNinja> nothing
<Vivix> MirrorImage, maybe- I only use paint.net when I need to edit images now, and paint tool or Animate 2 otherwise
<Pikachu> I love to sing but im shy in front of my mom and dad so i guess im going to be a fluttershy
<FlutterMEDIC> do you guys want to see what i was talking about?
<MirrorImage> "oo, money"
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: No really, what is it?
<Rustymeat> OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE

<BronyInstrumental> Wrek: ikr?
<FlutterMEDIC> i like the new sniper rifle
<Byakuya> 6I love it when they get scared.. :D

<killerpony7733> AppleDoom i mean't
<Vivix> the horror that was had was horror
<Byakuya> 6LOAD YOU SON OF A WAFFLE
<AppleDoom> what about trying to act like a mod when you're not, is THAT against da rules?
*Vyranis is having bad visions
<Vivix> AppleDash, it's normal to remind people of the rules here
<tSparx> AppleDoom: Impersonating a mod? No rules against that.
<Vivix> woops wrong ping
<tSparx> AppleDoom: I don't think :P
<killerpony7733> AppleDoom what about listening to the rules and don't be a douche
<Wrek> 05yes there is
<Canadian_Brony> AppleDoom we're just notifying you so you don't get yourself kicked or banned
<shibaru> Why does it keep cutting it short? ;-;
<Wrek> 05and AppleDoom: it is in fact common coutersy for the users of this chat to remidn otehr users when they tend to foget the smiplest of rules.
<tSparx> AppleDoom: But, the whole love & tolerance thing encourages *us* to warn everypony *before* mods have to get involved.
<killerpony7733> Wrek what vivix said reminding people as a user is ok but acting liek you got power then you are breaking the rules too
<Cades> probably cuz youtubes retarded
<Canadian_Brony> also, have you read the rules yet AppleDoom? If not, please read them here http://www.bronystate.net/rules/

<AJIsAwesome> RainbowDash90: Hello.
<tSparx> CCCP: it is true though.
<killerpony7733> Wrek pretty much. If you really come in with the attitude and breaking several rules off the bat. you DESERVE it
<Vivix> Appledoom came in and instantly started trouble
<Applejack2012> good evening
<Brad__> obvious troll.
<tSparx> I honestly wasn't all that mad until the ragequit
<CCCP> tSparx the truth is a lie!
<Wrek> 05CCCP y u no liek meeeh
<Canadian_Brony> Brad__ is obviously bad at trolling
<Brad__> yes
<Wrek> 05u seem to qeustion erryting ah do
*Canadian_Brony throws a muffin at Wrek
<Vivix> I don't think he was a troll, but- the behaviour was abhorrent anyway
<CCCP> Wrek :( oh i liek you...
<CCCP> sorry :s
*Vivix abuses english
<killerpony7733> Vivix in simple he was being a douche
<Vivix> yeah
<Brad__> Im surprised theres not more trolls here or people causing problems.
<tSparx> Also anyone using fag as an insult is gonna raise my ire
<Vivix> Me too, but I'm happy about it
<CCCP> Brad__ why?
<Vivix> The amount of trolls on other places is so high, maybe they're just too young to know what Irc is
<Petrified_Discord> Yeah, from what I've seen the mods are pretty fast to kick anyone trolling
<Brad__> CCCP, bronys are kind of a magnet for trolls
<MirrorImage> alright, well i have work in a few minutes *sadface*
<MirrorImage> later folks
<tSparx> Vivix: I am amazed by the number of people on this channel who are younger than IRC :P
<Vivix> later MirrorImage
<robotdragon9> bai MirrorImage
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Have as much fun as possible :P
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah- there's quite a bit
<CCCP> Brad__ Bronies ARE troll
<Applejack2012> cya
<CCCP> trolls*
<Canadian_Brony> He reminded me of a guy I know at school. He thinks he's cool when he juts around sprouting horrible insults which I either easily counter or simply ignore.
<FlutterMEDIC> back
<Wrek> 05Brad__: thats becasue we are good at cleanign our trash
<Brad__> CCCP, LOL
<Wrek> 05that and that its not that big of a site
<Brad__> Wrek, i can see that
<Vivix> The mods here are very competent compared to many I've seen
<tSparx> Wrek: Times like these make me really appreciate the good mod-age :)
<Saturn> 08,01im a troll
<Petrified_Discord> Saturn: :O
<Canadian_Brony> hi Saturn
<robotdragon9> i lost legion in the end :/
<Wrek> 05tSparx: moddage or mod age as in time passing
<Masdragonflare> I'm back
<CCCP> :3
<CCCP> Hello Saturn
<Canadian_Brony> WB Masdragonflare
<Unnr|Gardening> Saturn, you´re an OP, which means you are not just any troll, you are an officially sanctioned troll
<CCCP> hi Masdragonflare!
<Applejack2012> hey
<FlutterMEDIC> WB Masdragonflare
<DerpyMuffins> Hi Saturn
<tSparx> Wrek: Moddagge, I guess. The act of y'all Moderating for us
<Saturn> 08,01inddedd
<Masdragonflare> Thanks guys :)
<Vivix> He's the token one
<Unnr|Gardening> :3
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn is Saturn. 'Nuff said.
<Masdragonflare> I commented on another brony hater
<CCCP> Tara Strong is a better troll then half of the internet
<Masdragonflare> oh well
<Byakuya> 6For the love of God.. -.-
<Masdragonflare> brb getting some cider
<killerpony7733> Dat ominous music
<FlutterMEDIC> the only mods or administrators i dont tolerate are childre or VERY immature/stupid ones.
<robotdragon9> so many trolls and not enough bridges
<Brad__> CCCP, thats true!
<FlutterMEDIC> children*
<Petrified_Discord> CCCP: Ubertroll
<Vivix> I usually say trolls don't exist, but that might be a troll in itself in this silly internet lingo
<killerpony7733> FlutterMEDIC yeah i know how it feels.
<CCCP> Brad__ Petrified_Discord :D
<Brad__> Tara strong's twitter is a goldmine of awesomeness
<shibaru> http://youtu.be/ZFpPfw2xqpk There we go :3 Don't ask why I changed the picture lol
<Canadian_Brony> CCCP Tara Strong is better troll than the entire internet. She's the only troll out there who actually does it well.
<CCCP> Canadian_Brony i guess..
<Cades> well thats all it is for me, a picture lol
<Vivix> I'd rather say she's teasing and tweaking
<killerpony7733> Vivix tried boring a troll to death? i did once the troll resorted to spamming a bit and all until i decided it was enough and called a mod
<DerpyMuffins> I think Tara is the only troll that we all love
<shibaru> XD
<Petrified_Discord> Seriously, just look at Tara's latest tweet about her "secret boyfriend." :P
<Vivix> Hehe, that's my usual approach, placant and polite, not contradicting him or her
<tSparx> "Maybe I could say it promotes butt tatoos, but... damnit!"
<robotdragon9> i got so much stream lag
<Buytoast> did i miss some dumb fucker test too much patience?
<killerpony7733> Vivix that and i provide little to no information for the troll to use
<Cades> im almost halfway done my jawbreaker :P
<Vivix> yeah
<tSparx> Buytoast: You did indeed.
<tSparx> Buytoast: Fortunately she or he left very quickly.
<Vivix> trying to debate with a troll is--futile, because even the troll don't believe what he himself say
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP Tara Strong is best troll
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma Tara strong is just Best _____ everything
<Canadian_Brony> I gots a question 'bout the stream . . . WTF is happening?!?!
<DerpyMuffins> Dat bass cannon
<FlutterMEDIC> Shephard now has a Bass Cannon
<Barbetos> commander pon3?
<Byakuya> 6I like it :3
<Applejack2012> The canon is cannon
<robotdragon9> lol
<tSparx> The cannon is canon
<tSparx> Cannon iff canon
<shibaru> :3
<FlutterMEDIC> LAZAH
<tSparx> Nah, that doesn't work out.
<Dusky> 8,05Vyranis: you poked me in pm and then ran away, what do you want?
<shibaru> Should I put up a download link?
<DerpyMuffins> New mod?
<CrimsonPhoenix> nope
<Vivix> who the he
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dusky you can't have color
<tSparx> Oy, brah
<Vivix> disable your colourscript dude!
<Canadian_Brony> hi Dusky . . . woah, you have colours.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's mod only
<Byakuya> 6Why not? ^^
<Dusky> network admin
<Vivix> Ooh
<Dusky> I dislike colours though
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh damn you ponychat
<Canadian_Brony> Dusky you are fanceh.
<tSparx> He's a Server Admin.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do admit those colors are fancy
<FlutterMEDIC> BUFFER
<Dusky> I also dislike being poked and then the person not following through
<Vivix> I don't know if Vyranis is AFK or not, but he's been silent for a while
<robotdragon9> this looks like tron all of a sudden
<Applejack2012> Dusky went Rapidash
<tSparx> Vivix:Vyranis isn't marked AFK on the /whois, and I haven't heard from her/him in a moment
<robotdragon9> well im gonna leave now...see u all later
<Canadian_Brony> seeya robotdragon9
<tSparx> cya robotdragon9
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: Bye.
<Applejack2012> seeya
<Dark92Enigma> By the way......alexxm i remembered the Pony episode b for movie night.....Fall Weather Friends
<Canadian_Brony> I have two theories: A) he suddenly went AFK B) something crashed on his end and Vyranis is just a ghost
<Byakuya> 6I must look pretty random with a toothpick in my hand..
<alexxm> thanks Dark92Enigma
<Canadian_Brony> hi alexxm
<Dusky> Canadian_Brony: or he pmed me and then ran away
<Vivix> I've never seen him before
<Dusky> >_<
<alexxm> how you doing Canadian_Brony
<Dusky> also, this is how I get away with colour: Overriding KICK from Sumica on Dusky in #bronystate
<Canadian_Brony> Dusky that is also a good theory
<Canadian_Brony> alexxm:
<Canadian_Brony> DAMMIT
<Vivix> hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> woa is this Tron?
<Barbetos> Nope!
<Canadian_Brony> alexxm I'm alright

<Saturn> 08,01hullo Dusky!
<Saturn> 08,01

<Dusky> heya Unnr|Gardening

<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix he's inside a network shooting viruses. Or some such bullshit, I don't know.
<Unnr|Gardening> Hows life???
<Byakuya> 6I love singing when I'm home alone.. :3
<Dusky> Unnr|Gardening: it goes
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn not much to see, mostly empty. I suggest you visit Luna on the moon. She's really nice if you stay away from her toaster.
<Byakuya> 6I wish I had learnt more Japanese while I could..now the holidays are almost over and I just know 30 random words.. -.-
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Why her toaster?
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome not sure. Just don't touch it.
<Barbetos> Derpy just broke that space ship
<Canadian_Brony> or look at it
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Ok.
<Cades> i remember a while ago dez played a free (i think) game that taught you japanese. ill see if i can go find it
<Dusky> time for a nice relaxing steam shower ~ <3

<tSparx> y'all need to stay put now :P
<Cades> anytime :)
<CCCP> ded
<tSparx> Huh, well this is cool-looking
<Byakuya> 6:3
<Zombie_Brony> CCCP nah, if it were dead, I'd be a zomb-shit
<Zombie_Brony> not again
<Masdragonflare> Alright I just took a shower
<tZombie> Zombie_Brony: Damnit
<Masdragonflare> I'm back :)
<tZombie> It's infectious...
<Saturn> 08,01so what if, right, chrysalis had had sex with shining armour
<shibaru> I feel tired
<Zombie_Brony> tZombie Hey! I was a zombie before you!
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: ................
<Saturn> 08,01and had becomepregnant
<Masdragonflare> :o
<Zombie_Brony> Saturn there's a fic about that already
<tZombie> Zombie_Brony: You must be a virusy zombie. Nothing I can do about it :P
<Byakuya> 6D:
<Cades> same here haha, i was up till almost 3 talking to mayo :P
<Saturn> 08,01assumingthat changlelings and ponies can breed
<Masdragonflare> O_O
<tZombie> Saturn: Reasonable assumption
<Unnr|Gardening> Saturn: The baby would be the most adorable chest-burster ever?
<Applejack2012> lol
<Canadian_Brony> tZombie sure there is! Change your nick.
*tZombie is raised up by Jesus / whoever
<shibaru> I hope Mike lets me guest commentate... and soon .3.
<killerpony7733> Unnr|Gardening haha
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Phew, good call :)
<Saturn> 08,01well, i think changelings either descnended fromponies, or at least shared a common ancestor
<Lil_B> Saturn I though they would just suck up their "Love" and then kill them withou having to mate :/
<Cades> i hope so too
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: If I'm ever stepping on the toes of your joke, lemme know and I'll back off :$
<Kandarihu> Well, physiological compatability between ponies and changlings aren't canon.
<CrimsonPhoenix> my headcanon on changelings is that they need to trap ponies in a chrysalis (you know the coccoon) in which you slowly corrupt them and transform them into changelings
<tSparx> Saturn: Maybe they're the result of an experiment Chrysalis did as a unicorn, when her magic went horribly awry...
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I call my schtick either way
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: maybe chrysalis' goal was also to produce a changeling unicorn hybrid?
<CCCP> :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> which would**
<Masdragonflare> ...maaaaabyyyy
<shibaru> I should tell him I love him like right in the middle of it all, at a point where it would be difficult to edit out xD
<Cades> i would die if you did that :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> and also about chrysalis origin I'll say that story in heart's and hooves day might be linked
<Lil_B> Saturn well, I wass just assuming things I actually saw in the ep XD ... and well... after that... maybe as an Ultimate Weapon to consume the rest of the World
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Okedy dokedy :) I understand that, my dad's the same way: "Don't get in the way of my joke!" Haha
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: óoooooooo
<shibaru> Like maybe during a boss battle or something
<Saturn> 08,01now thats a fun possibility, with the hearts and hooves
<shibaru> -boss comes up- I LOVE YOU, MIKE!!!!
<Cades> ya haha
<tSparx> Never watched the Valentine's day ep
<CrimsonPhoenix> with the love poison and all
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<CrimsonPhoenix> that kingdom that fell
<CrimsonPhoenix> now they're changelings
<Vivix> ah yes
<Cades> what time is it for you byakuya?
<Vivix> That sounds cool CrimsonPhoenix
<Applejack2012> its a must see
<Canadian_Brony> if anypony is intrigued my Saturn's idea, there's a fic about it. "The Foal in the Basket". I can link it if I get permission. Saturn?
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: You're not really missing out.
<tSparx> Wait, love poison? That sounds AWESOME
<Lil_B> ... that sounds like a really good Idea for a Creative FanFic
<shibaru> I wonder how many times I've told him I love him...
<Canadian_Brony> Lil_B there is one.
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: if its not dirty, sure
<Masdragonflare> haha tSparx
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, you can PM it
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28718/The-Foal-in-The-Basket
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I have a general ban on Valentine's day, and I rarely make exceptions. This sounds worth it though :)
<Dark_Horst> kinda
<Canadian_Brony> I haven't read it, but it has high ratings
<CrimsonPhoenix> looks short
<Dark_Horst> who's playing again=
<Cades> not enough
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: Smi
<Vivix> I like thinking Chrysalis is totally incapable of feeling love, but might be attached to a creature that feeds her regurarely out of convienence and companionship
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst Sumi
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: It's actually making a reference to a certain PPG episode.
<Dark_Horst> but where is is oc?
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Oh?
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: Sumipony isn't put up during ME
<Masdragonflare> oh?
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvzDthMqSck
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst I dunno. Not up there
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: Messes with the framerate, apparently.
<Cades> am i the only person who thinks hes hilarious?
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, it's actually not like any other valentines day special
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Yeah. I did some research, and a scene is a very possible reference to PPG.
<Vivix> It was pretty cool, good song too
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I'll watch it, tell you what I think :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> CMC messed up by trying to do a favor for cherilee and now they have to fix it
<shibaru> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9kzx4FUCg1qcxcjfo1_500.jpg
<shibaru> Oh my
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: I'll give you a hint: it's part of Applebloom's daydream.
<Vivix> Cheerilees face in that episode, is amazing, when the CMC first start bugigng her
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome what is PPG?
<Lil_B> I don't that Crysalis is incapable of feeling love, She does Care for her Changlings
<Vivix> Powerpuff girls
<tSparx> I know the plot involves some Mac N Cheriliee, that's about it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Powerpuff Girl?
<Vivix> well, motherly love and care, but not romantic love
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<tSparx> Tara Strong's other love <3 haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<Cades> XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Powerpuff Girls
<Vivix> in the song she says "In my heart there is no room" so-- either she loves someone, her hive or otherwise, or she can't feel it
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: My theory is that she can't feel love and that she only uses love and a form of consumption.
<AJIsAwesome> *as a form of consumption*
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah that is what I think too, but that she is very fond of her hive
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Agreed.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Vivix That's my headcanon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'd say she really didnt care at all regardless if she could
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well she IS a queen
<ponyfromPR> eloo
<shibaru> It must be pretty nasty in there
<DerpyMuffins> I think Crysalis loves herself too much for there to be room in her heart
<Cades> blue waffles :P
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix . . . lemme go off and get philisophical and I'll talk to you again with my thoughts.
<Vivix> I think linking the story from hearts episode with chrysalis would be cool, but in my headcanon she was never a pony to begin with-
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Lore is fun!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never tell me the odds
<Applejack2012> In my fic the Changelings came from out of space under the Owlisous meteor shower
<AJIsAwesome> Well, technically she would have to have a certain feeling for her subjects becuase if she didn't care about them she never would've found food for them in the first place. She would've only found food for herself.
<tSparx> I don't really have any headcanon about the changeling's origins, but I'm not as big a fan of them as some of my fellow bronies are :)
<shibaru> Yes
<Pearly> hey everypony
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Unless they somehow add to her power
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Hello!
<Applejack2012> hey!
<Vivix> I really like them because they are so different to ponies, in behaviour
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Pearly
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Could want them for selfish reasons, idk
<Canadian_Brony> hi Pearly
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not much of a headcanon guy, but that's my theory.
<tSparx> Sup Pearly :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love changelings for the whole swarm idea which brings many cool stuff
<Pearly> not much here
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah- I believe she has strong motherly love or something for her hive-
<Pearly> just showered, now she is a clean pny
<CrimsonPhoenix> Transformation, Mind Control, Corrutpion
<Prick> then you know what you have to do to her....muhahaha
<tSparx> das buffer :/
<Vivix> yeah, she's doing what she has to do, but the swarm is not a--'nice and good' bunch
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh wait a sec I think I'm getting kinda creepy right noe
<CrimsonPhoenix> now**
<Vivix> Tailsopony?
<Lil_B> tSparx der*
<tSparx> Lil_B: This buffer
<tSparx> Lil_B: Not the buffer
<Lil_B> tSparx or das Buffern
<Pearly> not much tSparx hey there Canadian_Brony how are you MLP_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome ?
<Vivix> Den bufferen
<tSparx> Oy, Whovians: Which ep is the one where Eccleston shows up on earth (I think) any notices all the text around him says BADWOLF and then something takes over the companion's mind? Or something? I only kinda remember it
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Pretty good.:)
<tSparx> and he * notices
<Pearly> thats good AJIsAwesome
<shibaru> Lol talking about darkspyro on the phone
<Canadian_Brony> Pearly I'm currently in thought of the idea that Chrysalis can feel love.
<Cades> with who?
<shibaru> Gen
<Cades> do i know who that is?
<Unnr|Gardening> tSparx: Episode 12, Season 10
<Kandarihu> Oops. Paragon points
<Unnr|Gardening> ait
<Unnr|Gardening> wait
<tSparx> Unnr|Gardening: Danke schoen!
<Unnr|Gardening> Season 1
<Unnr|Gardening> of new who
<tSparx> I knew what you meant :)
<Vivix> I think the song indicates either that she can't feel erotic love (elske) but can feel motherly love/care, or that her heart was already captured (which miight tie in to the heart and hooves legend)
<CCCP> :(
<ArcherJoe11> You can't be Renegade against Tali
<shibaru> My only friend in real life
<Cades> oh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And so the tales of Dickshep end for today
<AJIsAwesome> I think I should just wait until the show gives more details about Chrysalis or not.
<Lil_B> ^
<Vivix> It is very--high and fleety, we might not ever get more info though-
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], except that he got some Paragon Points at the end
<Vivix> but whoever said that abou the hearts and hooves things, now that's stuck in my mind
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He's slightly dickshep now
<Kandarihu> I love how the buffer circle is right in the middle of the menu circle. It fits together amazingly well
<alexxm> doesn't he always do dick shepard
<emangamer> dat SlurryMoon
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix hey, that's getting somewhere. She clearly states she doesn't love Shining Armour, but he (technically) loves her. She feeds off the love of others. When you consider the legend, it's possible that she was the queen and after being under the effects of the love potion for years and years, and possibly never becoming cured of it, she needed love to feed off of.
<tSparx> alexxm: Sometimes Smi picks the paragon options (or whatever, the goodguy options)
<shibaru> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3HVHNf-oW4 This is the song that I kill people to
<Kandarihu> GUNDAM STYLE
<tSparx> alexxm: But sledom
<tSparx> seldom*
<Cades> STOP TORTURING ME WITH MUSIC THAT I CANT LISTEN TO :(
<DerpyMuffins> lol Sumi
<pony_7007> perfact timing
<Sumica> 00,10manly when it makes sence tSparx
<tSparx> Sumica: Yeah, I know :)
<shibaru> NEVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix therefore, she became Queen Chrysalis and stole away the love of other ponies for her own use.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: That's a VERY interesting and plausible theory. Nice.
<tSparx> Oh right, Linux and Netflix don't mix
<Vivix> Yes, it sounds really cool
<SlurryMoon> 03 hm?
<Vivix> I think the song and the legend in the valentine sode kinda fits-
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome this is what happens when I get a strange idea and time.
<DerpyMuffins> Its almost to 100 billion views i think
<Canadian_Brony> hi SlurryMoon
<Vivix> but it might just be coincidence
<Kandarihu> The dancing GM Head
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: One question I'm thinking of is what happened to the king in the love story.
<MadSurge> Heeeeyyyy sexy layydeee :D
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<AJIsAwesome> SlurryMoon: Hello!
<DerpyMuffins> Hi SlurryMoon
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, was the king a pony or an alicorn?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Canadian_Brony bar the spawning of hordes of insectoid offspring
<Vivix> I want to rewatch that part of the episode to check-
<MadSurge> DAT ASS
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello MaxTheBrony
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I think he was a pony.
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome died. With him gone. Chrysalis needed love.
<MaxTheBrony> heya MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Vivix> Then he probably died- and she can't love anyone but him
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: True.
<shibaru> I haven't been on darspyro in so long
<MaxTheBrony> is this like Gundam style?
<tSparx> Oh, so NOW the stream works for me :P
<Silver_Spoon> Let it be said that this is -very- interesting to wake up to after a nap
<Canadian_Brony> SlurryMoon you missed my theory of how Chrysalis came to be. I made it up in 5 minutes.
<tSparx> But die Sumipony :)
<Cades> im just a lurker :p
<Vivix> Really cool theory
<shibaru> xD
<Silver_Spoon> also, hai everypony
<Vivix> I hope we get more lore and stuff to nerd over in the show in S3
<MaxTheBrony> heya Silver_Spoon
<AJIsAwesome> Silver_Spoon: Hello!
<Canadian_Brony> I would repost, but it's a wall.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Silver_Spoon
<Vivix> even inconsistncies or jokes- even mistakes make for great lore

<tSparx> He does not know*.
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Welcome back!
<Vivix> Thanks AJIsAwesome!
*Byakuya 6half feels like playing Okami
<Dumorimasoddaa> The whole spell is broken by X time appart
<Vivix> Dumorimasoddaa, That's true!
<Dumorimasoddaa> Your ideas don't account for that at all
<Vivix> but maybe long time effects of the love poison is pretty severe-
<Vivix> oh it wasn't my idea
<MadSurge> Dat moustache
<Vivix> but that might complicate it, I can't ermember the whole text of the legend
<MASF123|> No Brony likes me. :(
<tSparx> Doc..tor...
<Dumorimasoddaa> They fixed it
<Dumorimasoddaa> All was fine
<SpeedyBolt> Impossibru
<shibaru> Someone other than me drawing one of Mike's characters... it feels so weird...
<Dumorimasoddaa> They made a holiday about it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :O
<MadSurge> EXTERMINATE
<Sumica> 00,10he just shit himself
<SpeedyBolt> Dat smile
<Dumorimasoddaa> There's transcripts of every pony episode up on the net
<Canadian_Brony> dat face
<DerpyMuffins> No ammo
<Byakuya> 6Who exactly is Mike? >.<
<alexxm> doctors mad
<SpeedyBolt> inb4 die
<MadSurge> LOL YOU CAN'T SHOOT ME
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Doc's all "WUT NOW NOOB?!"
<tSparx> Haha
<shibaru> The senpai that I hope notices me
<tSparx> That's what you think
<Vivix> I thought they couldn't fix it? Looking for the quote or something now
<Byakuya> 6Aa..Good luck :3
<Sumica> 00,10the more I watch this Dr the more I like him
<OneTrickPony> Doctor who!
<tSparx> ... awkward :P
<DerpyMuffins> Crazy Doc is best Doc
<tSparx> Doesn't this not happen until 10th Doc
<shibaru> I tell him I love him at least once a day XD
<tSparx> Y'know, time travel and all
<Byakuya> 6xD Nice ^^
<GreenKitteh> Hello!
<AJIsAwesome> GreenKitteh: Hello!
<SpeedyBolt> Join the club, bro
<tSparx> I thought Tennant was the one who 'dealt' with the time lords
<alexxm> how you doing GreenKitteh
*Cades i know how to do this
<Canadian_Brony> eyp
<Canadian_Brony> *yep
<GreenKitteh> Good. Good
<Byakuya> 6xD
<alexxm> at least until the end of the season
<MadSurge> The Dalek is really depressed now
<Byakuya> 6Idk why but I've liked the word senpai ever since I heard it.. x)
<GreenKitteh> by the way. anyone know when season 3 is coming?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Jesus!
<Canadian_Brony> Exterminate
<MadSurge> KILL IT
<tSparx> GreenKitteh: No one knows, and no one would be at liberty to guess.
<GreenKitteh> damn#
<Alister> How did he know that switch would elictrify him ?
<Silver_Spoon> the poor thing :(
<Alister> HOW ?
<Canadian_Brony> Alister dumb luck
<SpeedyBolt> O
<Rustymeat> hes giving him the stare
<Barbetos> its shaking in its space boots
<Vivix> "Chaos reigning"
<Alister> Canadian_Brony: More like bad writing
<Saturn> 08,01who sent me that chrysalis fic?
<tSparx> "I know that sounds incredible" lawl
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I did. Why?
<Saturn> 08,01my god, itis amazing
<Canadian_Brony> I'm glad you enjoy it!
<Vivix> Hearts and hooves legend don't seem to refer to any tribe other than Unicorn, and it ends with Chaos reigning, so it sounds more like a "Time for Luna and Cleestia to step in" origin than Chyrsalis-
<DerpyMuffins> What was it?
<Alchemist> swag
<CCCP> Saturn whats it called?
<alexxm> so this guy was the kid from war games
<Rustymeat> OH MAI
<Vivix> Ofcourse, legends rarely represent reality-
<tSparx> dat hamfisted flirting
<Barbetos> ugh
<Vivix> The foal in the basket is the fics name
<Sumica> 00,10what fic Saturn?
<shibaru> Me too
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica this one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28718/The-Foal-in-The-Basket
<Vivix> I'll put it on my toreadlist too-
<tSparx> Seriously, sumipony makes me giddy :D
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: foal in the basket
<shibaru> I LOVE YOU, MIKE SENPAAAAIIIII~!!!!
<shibaru> XD
<CCCP> Saturn ty (:
<Byakuya> 6xD ^^
<DerpyMuffins> She has a baby?
<Barbetos> That story has had a lot of views.
<tSparx> dat torture
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i hope that rich guy gets whats coming to him lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH MY GOSH
<Canadian_Brony> the common cold CANNOT be cured
<DerpyMuffins> Saturn is the fic about incest?
<Canadian_Brony> it changes every year
<Canadian_Brony> slightly
<Canadian_Brony> THERE IS NO CURE
<Kandarihu> Sketch_Toku_Brony, I hope you understand that normal rich guys aren't evil like him.
*Cades is an irc expert
<Deidara> 7xD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Kandarihu I do lol Tony Stark is my kinda rich guy :D
<alexxm> don't talk to the killing machine
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Aw... poor killing machine
<tSparx> I've never felt sad for a Dalek before
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: So it's basically the theory of Applebloom being Chrysalis's love child?
<Canadian_Brony> I HATE it when people say they cured it. The common cold virus changes its genetic code slightly every year.
<Deidara> 7I wish Facebook was a bit more fun.. ._.
<Canadian_Brony> That's why it comes back.
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<Cades> facebook sucks :P
<OneTrickPony> yay
<MadSurge> OH MY GOD HE'S HULKING OUT
<Barbetos> By the power of rose!
<AJIsAwesome> Uh oh..............
<Deidara> 7:P
<CrimsonPhoenix> yep
<shibaru> Facebook blocked me for no reason
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh snap :O
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Who knows what science will do to it.
<shibaru> Both my emails
<Deidara> 7o.o
<Canadian_Brony> he's sucking him to death!
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx not cure it.
<Cades> all i use it for is following my favorite artists
<MadSurge> THE POWER OF THE PLUG
<CrimsonPhoenix> 1
<Dumorimasoddaa> Canadian_Brony every year is being slow for cold/flu
<CrimsonPhoenix> second
<CrimsonPhoenix> flat
<Deidara> 7Maybe they realised you were the same person or something..Idk.. o.o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Damn
<Sumica> 00,10wait the passcode was ############
<Deidara> 7:O
<Dumorimasoddaa> They mutate ludicrously fast
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: I'd like to think we can work faster than the cold.
<shibaru> So I had to make a new one with a new email that I only made for making the new one
<Cades> grey man :o
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Deidara> 7:O
<AJIsAwesome> And that's why you should never trust a Dalek...........:|
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: But even if we can't, maybe someday an AI can.
<DerpyMuffins> Shoot it in the eye
<Dumorimasoddaa> The common cold would be curable if we found a cure to all/most virus
<Buytoast> this is an interesting show
<MadSurge> No selling those bullets like a boss
<Sumica> 00,10oh god it just downloaded all of 4chan
<Agrold> haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELP
<Dumorimasoddaa> But then curing the cold would be at the bottom of a huge list
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It has all the porn!
<tSparx> Sumica: I'm surprised it didn't go insane haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> WE'RE DOOMED
<OneTrickPony> oh god cats
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And lolcats!
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D then it should die in one second
<Sumica> 00,10it's already insaine
<Barbetos> I saw all the R34...
<alexxm> that darlek must have seen so much porn
<Alchemist> Dumorimasoddaa: maybe for a season. then at least one virus would mutate rendering the serum useless
<Agrold> it contains too much hentai now for anyone to stop it
<tSparx> I mean insnae even for a dalek
<Sumica> 00,10remember they said it burned for 3 days when it crashed
<MadSurge> ZAPP'D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Matrix!
<OneTrickPony> wat
<CCCP> noo!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What the hell does that x ray laser do?
<tSparx> Sumica: Yeah but a normal guy said that, not the Doc.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Alchemist nah I'm assuming we found a universal cure to the viruses work
<MadSurge> The bullets evaporate before reaching him!
<Buytoast> never really seen this show before
<CCCP> That guy was sooo important to the plot nuu!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fuck you man
<alexxm> extermite all the things
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh fluttershy
<Agrold> all ded
<MadSurge> THAT DALEK IS UNIQUE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why do we get a xray everytime someone gets zapped?
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I will say it again. The common cold changes its genetic code every year. A vaccine allows your immune system to recognize the genetic code of a virus and destroy it. If it changes constantly, a vaccine is impossible to create.
<Malk> Howdy Everypony hows it been?
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Yeah, but it doesn't change constantly
<AJIsAwesome> Malk: Hello!
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: It changes rapidly.
<MadSurge> Canadian_Brony: thank god it's not a powerful virus :D
<Sumica> 00,10it can still shoot you
<SpadeMagnes[R]> They cant use stairs
<Barbetos> Do not put all your faith in stairs.
<OneTrickPony> XD
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx you knew what I meant.
<alexxm> elevate
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Maybe one day we can build an AI that makes vaccines faster than the cold mutates
<SpadeMagnes[R]> inb4 ded
<MadSurge> ELEVATE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh shit
<CrimsonPhoenix> EXTERMINATE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> IT CAN FLOAT
<MadSurge> STAIRS DO NOT WORK
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh god ITS LEARNING :O Stairs are no MATCH
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: I do know what you meant, but that's what I'm getting at: it changes rapidly, maybe we can fight it more rapidly some day
<OneTrickPony> crush. kill. destroy. swag
<Malk> Hey tSparx is the world ready for our debate?
<tSparx> Though, really, we should just stop fighting the cold :P
<Deidara> 7Anyone want to see watermelon art? ._.
<Cades> uh? sure lol
<tSparx> Malk: Which one?
<AJIsAwesome> DAT ELITISM
<DerpyMuffins> So robots are racist now?
<Deidara> 7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuiVLP7F0eY&feature=related
<Deidara> 7xP
<MadSurge> He's the ultimate racist!
<tSparx> dat hubris
<Buytoast> it's a mutant
<Malk> tSparx the one about everything such as the meaning of life and politics
<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU FOOL
<Alister> Wait , are the daleks robots or mutants in an armor ?
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: it's really a cyborg
*SpadeMagnes[R] flips a table
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then humans were stupid
<Malk> tSparx Philosphy
<CrimsonPhoenix> again
<MadSurge> Alister: mutant/cyborg
<Barbetos> Don't even tell them that it is right behind?
<DerpyMuffins> Mutant/Cyborg/robot
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx we'd have to track down the mutated viruses every time. A vaccine would be massively expensive to re-create on an irregular basis. It's cheaper to let people deal with the virus with chicken noodle soup and cold syrup.
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: I agree, but post-singularity, who knows what's possible?
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: To quote Momo from Questionable COntent, "The exciting thing about living in a post-singularity world is that we do not know."
<MadSurge> We need the heroes from Borderlands to kill a Dalek :D
<Rex_Mundi> its an evil salt shaker
<OneTrickPony> ^
<tSparx> dat zap
<CCCP> lol
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx true. For all we know, that day may not come in our lifetime.
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: or a pepper shaker :D
<alexxm> showers for everyone
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH MY GOD
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Yeah, I'm not counting on it :P
<Sumica> 00,10be effecent
<Buytoast> man, those nameks are brutal
<CrimsonPhoenix> my jaw drop
<MadSurge> M-m-m-monster kill!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, it's Daleks
<Malk> tSparx neuro enhancement will happen in our life time though
<tSparx> Malk: Or not.
<MadSurge> When they say EXTERMINATE they mean it
<Canadian_Brony> Have a plan to use as many relevant quotes you know.
<Rex_Mundi> dat OC pony
<tSparx> Malk: I don't think we know enough about the brain to know how close we are to understanding it, know what I mean? We could figure it out tmorrow, or not in my lifetime.
<shibaru> My unicalade is hungry
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: it's Sumica's OC :)
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: I know <3
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Sumipony is my favorite :) She makes me SO HAPPY!!!!!! <3
<Cades> :o thats epic
<Malk> tSparx its said if our brains where so simple that we could understand we'd be to simple to understand it
<tSparx> "You would make a good dalek." /bitchslap
<Rustymeat> zing
<alexxm> burned
<AJIsAwesome> Dat twist.
<Alister> how do the Daleks survive in numbers as a species ? can they transform other people ?
<Canadian_Brony> does he have his Sonic Screwdriver or whatever the hay it is? And can it do anything? I know nothing of this show.
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: Sumica makes a pretty pony, eh? <3
<AJIsAwesome> Alister: If they could, he would've converted them instead of killing them.
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=062PkPix6XY
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fi9gtm8M1qfr9exo1_500.jpg
<Alister> AJIsAwesome: So invevitably all Daleks will die
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Everytime she rocks out, I go crazy-giddy crazy happy :D
<shibaru> Will this picture ever stop being funny?
<Malk> tSparx but we have them right now just not availble to the public and not exactly safe
<Cades> xD
<AJIsAwesome> Alister: I don't know about this show, but I think they must feed off of a certain energy, like electricity.
<Sumica> 00,10dr rage
<Alister> AJIsAwesome: They have no means of reporducing or adding to their numbers ?
<tSparx> 19 my ass
<AJIsAwesome> Alister: Like I said, I have no idea about this show.
<Malk> tSparx more like 20s
<tSparx> Malk: That actor is at LEAST in her late 20's
<Malk> tSparx I said more like 20x
<Malk> 20s
<CCCP> bad aiming
<AJIsAwesome> He's gained human feelings and emotions?
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: Wreks art is awesome too.
<MadSurge> Dalek is freaking out O__o
<Cades> you make mmd right shibaru?
<Sumica> 00,10wreks art is why Sumi looks so good
<tSparx> dun dun dun

<Daygon> Ok Malk i dont know that much
<tSparx> Alister: British for season :P
<Malk> Daygon I was asking if you really havent done it before?

<tSparx> MadSurge: Right?
<tSparx> MadSurge: Imagine Twi watching Star Trek do
<tSparx> OMG
<OohShiny> Daygon: You are from Guyane then?
<Barbetos> That face that guy had just seemed like he was thinking "I am so high right now."
<tSparx> Alister: So, y'know, when we celebrated the Dr. Who season premiere, they were celebrating the Dr. Who series premiere
<MadSurge> tSparx: she would really hate Q :D

<Sumica> 00,10not quite tSparx
<Sumica> 00,10they call it seasons as well
<Canadian_Brony> hey, I got a question. If a Time Lord can regenerate, how did the rest die?
<Sumica> 00,10Serise refers to when a new production studio took over the show
<Daygon> Now for the last 4 notes in the song in 3
<Daygon> 2

<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly it's a theme park food court
<tSparx> Or is it 19th?
<Barbetos> Time sick?
<Cynder7> 6Then again,the actual original game would be nice too..I haven't played it in years.. ._.
<Barbetos> Oh kay
<CK|GW2> ....so
<Sumica> 00,10because they refer to this Dr to searise 3
<CK|GW2> That happened.
<Daygon> Canadian_Brony You pretty much have to be a to be close to death not dead
<tSparx> Sumica: So for Brits, what's the difference between a season and a series? All my British tv on netflix is organized into series.
<Sumica> 00,10they also referr to tennet and smith as serise 3 as well
*CK|GW2 just ran into an apple-selling NPC named "Apple Jack".
<MadSurge> STOP NAGGING ME
<Daygon> near death not dead Canadian_Brony
<Cades> what systems do you have?
<Canadian_Brony> Daygon ah. Okay

<Buytoast> who said wikipedia is wrong?
<Buytoast> becuz their dum
<Cynder7> 6Mine's Cynder757,just so you'll know it's me ^^
<JESmith71> Sumica: Well in a way Wikipedia can't be wrong in some cases, on the important articles on it that are locked down from editing

<Cynder7> 6I also have WaW but for PS2
<Cades> which one is 6?
<Cynder7> 6MW2
<Cades> ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> this makes me think of that shitty movie
<CrimsonPhoenix> what's it called....
<Cades> i have waw, mw3 and bo
<Barbetos> Shitty movie 3?
<Cades> mw2 i mean
<Cades> not me3
<Cades> mw3
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<Cynder7> 6I think it's 6 at least..Didn't WaW come out between 4 and MW2?
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Canadian_Brony> >promises walls of gold
<Canadian_Brony> >Canada
<Barbetos> That needs a sub title.
<Cades> i think 4 war modern warfare, so ya waw came out before that
<Cynder7> 6BO was pretty awesome..
<tSparx> Seriously, not a single Briton here to help us out?
<Cynder7> 6:O
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, we definitely have walls of gold in here
<Canadian_Brony> dat true man
<Cades> what, if mw was 4 and mw2 was 6, then whats 5?
*CCCP is very happy
<Canadian_Brony> except our gold is more white-ish blue and very cold
<Sylandest> when suddenly, corpses
<Malk> Anyone have pure gold?
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: help ya out with what?
<BronyInstrumental> i'm a briton, what y'all need help with?
<shibaru> Movie's on now.
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: What is a series? Isn't it the equivalent to the American season?
<Cades> no waw is 5 lol
<Cynder7> 6Well,I assumed it was WaW..
<Cades> ya
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: In TV parlance.
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: a series is just a consecutive collection of shows
<Cynder7> 6Wasn't some BO2 to come out after MW3?
<Kandarihu> We got fields of Gold in America. Except our gold is black, formed from the bones of dinosaurs, and strictly protected by environmental regulations... for now.
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: some are a lot shorter than american "seasons" and some are equivalent
<Cades> yup
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: So what do you call the premiere of Dr. Who recently? The season premiere? The series premiere?
<Cynder7> 6It's not out yet,is it?
<Cades> no
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: WE callit the season premiere, cause it's a season of the series. a series is all of it put together, split up into seasons
<Cades> are you gonna get it?
<BronyInstrumental> call it*
<Canadian_Brony> Shoot him!
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: *I* see.
<Canadian_Brony> SHOOT HIM!!
<Canadian_Brony> GODAMMIT DON'T BE STUPID AND SHOOT HIM!!!
<Cynder7> 6Nah,doubt it..I'm not into FPS as much anymore so I'm happy with the two I've got :P
<Cynder7> 6What about you?
<Cades> same, i dont really like cod to much
<Barbetos> The barcode scanner does nothing!!
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: So then why is my Top Gear split up into 17 series (going up to 2011)?
<Canadian_Brony> or simply die
<Cynder7> 6x)
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: top gear is an exception, seeing as it could have different outcomes each time
<LunarSS> The Dr. who DVD's say 'First Series Second series' ect
<Cynder7> 6I wish I had a few games in mind..
<Cades> like what?
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: So we're on Series 18 of Top Gear, but season 7 of Dr. Who?
<BronyInstrumental> well, this is just what i've gotten used to in briton dialect
<Canadian_Brony> BronyInstrumental and (almost) ends on a bombshell. I've seen it once end in an "inconvenience".
<Canadian_Brony> *almsot always
<Canadian_Brony> **almost
<Canadian_Brony> I can't type
<BronyInstrumental> tSparx: precisely
<tSparx> BronyInstrumental: May I just suggest that that is confusing and dumb? jk :P
<Cynder7> 6Idk..I like action-adventure type of things..I want them to last long and have big levels..free roam ftw!
<Vivix> it is
<Vivix> and I don't think it's correct
<BronyInstrumental> it really is
<Cynder7> 6I guess Skyrim would be good but it's too expensive.. ._.
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: "And on that bombshell, g'night!" haha, good times :)
<Cades> well actually theres a zombie game thats being worked on right now called the dead linger

<Buytoast> speaking of drawing
<Silver_Spoon> My Little Chrono: Triggers Are Magic has updated *squee*
<Buytoast> what happened to that art contest you people were holding
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<shibaru> I wonder what Mike is doing...
<MaxTheBrony> It would be fun to host a show once a month about art in the bronysate community , with maybe a contest .
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: aren't you included in that generalized term "you people"
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Buytoast> i ain't a mod
<cowvarkian> ah, ok then
<MaxTheBrony> he maybe wasnt part of holding the contest :)
<cowvarkian> twasn't sure who ye were speaking of
<Canadian_Brony> well, Wrek draws often, kirz did some drawing the last time he streamed, and VioletVanilla streams music she creates which is technically an art.
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek keeps getting on frawfriend, his most recent drawing was the headliner for the latest drawfriend
<Pinkies4thWall> Who's ready to be jelly?

<MaxTheBrony> bye AppleDash
<Canadian_Brony> Rex_Mundi I need a girl first
<MaxTheBrony> Oops
<MaxTheBrony> wrong
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> Weddings are nice
<Vivix> but- most I've been to have been way too long
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: How long?
<Vivix> 4-5 hours, plus you know the party at the end, which I never attend
<MaxTheBrony> Weddings are overrated :S
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Wow...........
<Vivix> I'm going to a secret wedding soon, wich will last about 40 minutes
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<CCCP> Getting Married sound like a horrible idea
<MaxTheBrony> Secret?
<Vivix> I don't get the romance between LONG wedding ceremonys
<Klumzeedragon> Well hopefully I get a brony girlfriend that would approve. :P
<Vivix> we're gonna be like 4-5 people
<Vivix> so yeah noone should know
<Rex_Mundi> I would like a simple cerimony If i get married
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah all that around is just too much
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Ah. A shotgun wedding. :D
<CCCP> Getting Married sounds like constraining yourself for no reason
<Vivix> It's supposed to be about the love, not the money- but you know
<Vivix> people are different
<MaxTheBrony> a simple speech and the closest friends.
<Rex_Mundi> Man, having a brony girlfriend would be the best
<Vivix> hehe, well they've been together for 20 years
<DerpyMuffins> I just found out Wrek is an amazing artist
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> No waaaay
<MaxTheBrony> man
<Kandarihu> If I were to get married, I'd love to get one that trolls all the guests, or is otherwise memorable.
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: It's just putting a title on something.
<MaxTheBrony> DerpyMuffins he is amazing isnt he :)
<Vivix> you also get a lot of legal rights
<Vivix> like if your husband or wife dies, you have much less trouble surviving on your own
<MaxTheBrony> thats just evil :s
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon its more than that :(
<shibaru> Do I annoy you with my constant talk of Mike? XD
<Vivix> that's why they want equal rights between partnership and marriage in this country
<CCCP> thats why its bad
<DerpyMuffins> I mean Wrek does both cool art and adult art....
<MaxTheBrony> nah its just ponies with clothes xD
<Klumzeedragon> Kandarihu: Like a Celestia-esque girlfriend?
<Vivix> he does adult art though
<Vivix> with vajajays and stuff
<Cades> no haha its all good
<MaxTheBrony> deffine adult :P
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Vivix> erotic
<MaxTheBrony> wait whut.
<DerpyMuffins> Its seems ponies with clothes seem more erotic
<Vivix> he has only done one 18+ pic though
<DerpyMuffins> Irony
<Kandarihu> I meant the wedding.
<Vivix> well, as far as we know
<MaxTheBrony> IKR DerpyMuffins
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix i think he has done 2
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Itgoes both ways with marriage I suppose.
<tSparx|Away> DerpyMuffins: A few of us were talking about this the other day :)
<Vivix> really? neat
<MaxTheBrony> The cherlee and Aj i think
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<DerpyMuffins> I think like 4 or 5 of them
<Vivix> Oh, Haven't seen the AJ one
<CCCP> Never get married, Never get a job, Never drive a car, neverf eat, never talk, never go online, never leave your house, Jsut watch ponies
<DerpyMuffins> There is Twi, AJ, Cheerilie
<MaxTheBrony> I cant see it cause im a stupid mf who said my real age on dA ...
<Vivix> hehe
<that> t
<Ravebrony> I leave for a bit after listening to Franzl Lang ( a Yodeler) and return....to talk of Erotic Art!?!? Dafuq Chat! :D
<MaxTheBrony> I dont exactly know if its AJ
<DerpyMuffins> Maybe fluttershy
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon it just seems like marriage is taken to seriously just like life
<Vivix> I think the Cheerilee one is the only explicit one I've seen
<Applejack2012> Havent seenthat AJ and Cheerilee
<Rex_Mundi> Maximore saucy ponies for us then...
<shibaru> xD
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: But you're online know........
<AJIsAwesome> *now*
<MaxTheBrony> heh :P
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome darn it
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: He did an AJ one? .-. It's not on DA.
<Vivix> Ravebrony, Wrek's erotic art
<DerpyMuffins> It is
<MaxTheBrony> the Badapples?
<MaxTheBrony> wasnt that AJ
<Ravebrony> Vivix: Still! :D
<DerpyMuffins> Yea
<MaxTheBrony> im just guessing
<Rex_Mundi> Klumzeedragon: yes it is
<Vivix> hehehe
<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, he's not done with it
<DerpyMuffins> I'd post link, but you know....
<Ravebrony> *cough*ThisIsntPG13Convo*cough*
<Vivix> yyeah-
<Ravebrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> The Mods are asleep post wrek art :3
<Vivix> most of his 18 stuff were rapidly posted on other sites by other people
<Rex_Mundi> You can only pick one, who do you marry? http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/055/d/0/fim__ponies_in_wedding_dresses_wallpaper_by_milesprower024-d4qvm6t.png
<Vivix> Hmm!
<Ravebrony> =_(\
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Klumzeedragon> Rex_Mundi: I meant a naughty AJ. The Admarial AJ is up.
<DerpyMuffins> Can you post erotic ponies?
<MaxTheBrony> You can but its not allowed
<Vivix> No, sorry
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<DerpyMuffins> Is it even in the rules
<MLP_Brovakiin> Derpy_Hooves: I wouldn't
<Rex_Mundi> Klumzeedragon: There is another AJ one...
<Vivix> Probably Twi or Rarity, or Fluttershy
<Vivix> they look weird standing up though
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<DerpyMuffins> Its Muffins, not Hooves
<Vivix> DerpyMuffins, yeah it's in the rules
<spitfirecolt> rainbow dash for the win
<Vivix> I could never marry RD, or be with her- that personality type would just spark the oddest arguments
<tSparx|Away> DerpyMuffins: Yeah, it's actually PonyChat general rules too: all channels are SFW unless marked otherwise.

<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix, at least two of them were /b/
<CrimsonPhoenix> urgh /b/

<Vivix> I stopped going to 4chan after /y/ got boring
<Vivix> I bet you can tell I never went to b
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: /d/ is even worse than /b/. Do not go there, Crimson
<Pikachu> i wsh bronystate can go on my mc sever
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, I go to /d/ regurly
<Alchemist> what is /d/?

<Pikachu> well all be in equestria
<CrimsonPhoenix> I pleasure myself to that
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, er, more power to you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, you don't want to know
<Alchemist> I know about /b/, but dunno about /d/
<tSparx> Alchemist: It's where the *dark* porn goes
<Pikachu> buffer means/b/ i guess?
<tSparx> Which, I mean, really, more power to you if you like that, but MAN do I not haha
<oni_link> lol
<Vivix> for /b starting with "random anything" it sure has spawned alot of repetive stupid jokes
<Alchemist> tSparx: oh, well, Im not gonna go there :D
<tSparx> Pikachu: /b/ is a board on 4chan dot org
<Vivix> it is occationally spammed with childporn
<Pikachu> tSparx: ohs
<tSparx> Pikachu: It's famous for not having any rules (other than nothing illegal)
<Ravebrony> Aw no way! D:
<MaxTheBrony> Woooah
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: I know right? Pretty said.
<cow334> no stream right now
<tSparx> Pikachu: And it is a cesspool, whence the best and worst of a lot of internet culture has come.
<Ravebrony> Cancelled?
<MaxTheBrony> .... Childporn ... really?
<MaxTheBrony> Dem basterds...
<Vivix> It has happened a few times, they hate it
<cow334> MaxTheBrony: ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, what kind of rules are you talking about?
<cow334> ...
<Pikachu> tSprax: i better write this down
<Vivix> but some people hang there to snap it up before it gets deleted
<cow334> Dafuq you talking about
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: On /b/, the lack thereof
<DerpyMuffins> Wow I come back to read something about childporn?
<Ravebrony> I was going to something for that... but when i started College i poured my time into that D: Guess it was a good thing to do, lol
<Canadian_Brony> I walk out for 1 minute, come back and the first thing I read is "childporn"
<Pikachu> I think something random will pop up on stream
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Canadian_Brony> please
<tSparx> DerpyMuffins: /b/ is a weird place, man
<Canadian_Brony> no more
<Vivix> ;__;
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh /b/ is really anything
<Klumzeedragon> DerpyMuffins: *jazz hands* :O
<Alchemist> people said that /b/ is hilarious and memes are born there. what I saw is 90% porn, 10% trolling
<MaxTheBrony> Ok lets end conversation here..________
<CrimsonPhoenix> but 4chan in general has quite a few rules
<tSparx> Oh yes.
<Brad__> I see ponies everywhere. http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/53301000/jpg/_53301855_976_shuttle_nasa.jpg

<cow334> ...
*MLP_Brovakiin is glad he stays away from 4chan
<Vivix> I'm not a channer, I just never got into it
<cow334> what are you talking about
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, back then /b/ did make a LOT of memes
<Canadian_Brony> NOTHIGN
<tSparx> cow334: /b/
<Canadian_Brony> WE ARE TALKIGN ABOUT NOTHING
<Brad__> MLP_Brovakiin, me too.
<cow334> tSparx: OH GOD NO
<Vivix> memes aren't really good though
<CrimsonPhoenix> now it's nothing worth talking about
<Vivix> Canadian_Brony, don't worry, THAT wasn't part of the topic

<MLP_Brovakiin> AJ is my favorite but I beleve that it is down to personal prefrence
<cow334> CrimsonPhoenix: hhhhhmmmmmm....nnnaaaa
<MaxTheBrony> ;D
<Vivix> Rarity, PinkiePie and Fluttershyy!! Yaaay
<Klumzeedragon> tSparx: When you're a pony, gender s irrelevant?
<tSparx> OvergrownPegasus411: Well, for one thing, *I* joined, and that's important :$

<Applejack2012> Love AJ too
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: Burn it
<tSparx> Klumzeedragon: Nah, but when it's me on the Internet my gender's unimportant. I often go as female, just to see how people react.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<CCCP> Kandarihu mine is /b/b
<MLP_Brovakiin> Applejack2012: I gathered :D
<tSparx> Klumzeedragon: Usually pretty well, but only in recent years. /eyeroll
<OvergrownPegasus411> I don't really browsee 4chan. More of a redditor
<MaxTheBrony> tSparx your a virtel transvesite?
<Vivix> I don't browse reddit or 4chan
<Pikachu> i wish i can sing on bronysate :l i may be very shy like flutter shy
<tSparx> MaxTheBrony: I guess :P
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Kandarihu> My favorite is /g/, myself.
<Canadian_Brony> CCCP ignore it like I do 4chan. Iff it becomes a problem, phone the police.
*AJIsAwesome has never been on 4chan
<tSparx> MaxTheBrony: But I am very much, actually male. If you'll recall, I'm a Maxwell :)
<cow334> i dont go to four chan
<OvergrownPegasus411> Can't wait for season 3
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<shibaru> ;___; I always cry during movies...
<Klumzeedragon> tSparx: Funny how are people have declined huh?
*Alchemist is bored http://derpy.me/NXtkU
<CCCP> Canadian_Brony IT IS THE POLICE
*Vivix pats AJIsAwesome
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Niether have I, lets keep it that way
<Pikachu> my only questoin is who is the owner of bronystate
<tSparx> Klumzeedragon: Hmm?
<MaxTheBrony> Alchemist i know that feeling bro :p
<Kandarihu> OvergrownPegasus411, I agree. Bronystate has gone WAY downhill in the season gap
<cow334> new topic....
<MaxTheBrony> weather.
<Vivix> I think it's stayed the same
<MaxTheBrony> as i said.
<Canadian_Brony> CCCP where am I?
<Canadian_Brony> Canada
<Vivix> from as far as I remember
<cow334> How many licks dose it take to get to a center roll of a tootsie pop
<CCCP> Canadian_Brony lol
<sub06905> 2
<Canadian_Brony> buck 4chan
<cow334> >_>
<OvergrownPegasus411> I only visit bronystate for watching new seasons and aquabats
<MaxTheBrony> 44
<Klumzeedragon> tSparx: I don't know. :D
*Alchemist is very VERY bored http://derpy.me/b0IVg
<cow334> 100,124,103
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA&feature=my_watch_later_videos&list=WL914EFE097ED6B966 go watch this.
<tSparx> From my perspective, very little has changed xD
<cow334> Incounting
<CCCP> 4chan = where bronies were born
<MaxTheBrony> Alchemist that actually looks like its fun.
<Kandarihu> OvergrownPegasus411, okay. That's a bad way to put it. It hasn't gone WAY downhill. Sorry
<Vivix> It's just calmer, due to offseason
<tSparx> CCCP: And for that, I will always be grateful. But...
<oni_link> Whats the name of the background pony that is dressed up as a viking in the Luna Eclipse episode? I've always wanted to know that. Shes my favorite background pony
<Vivix> bronies might have been born on 4chan, but that is not all of our origin
<MLP_Brovakiin> I only discovered bronystate 5 weeks ago, but I love it. It is mainly the people, everyone here is so cool and nice <3
<OvergrownPegasus411> I like Lyra and COlgate
<Alchemist> MaxTheBrony: If I imagine myself do it irl it becomes a bit creepy
<Applejack2012> I visit Bronystate for Equestria Daily sneaks, and new seasons of course
<CCCP> *hugs MLP_Brovakiin*
<MaxTheBrony> Alchemist heh xD
<oni_link> MLP_Brovakiin: aww :)
<cow334> i like rose luck she is so awesome
<Canadian_Brony> I have a playlist of music, but you probably won't like it. Most of it is rock alternative by Simple Plan and Finger Eleven. 1/3 of it is pony music, tho
<Canadian_Brony> atleast
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs everyone :3
<cow334> MLP_Brovakiin: Awesome man
<MaxTheBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: <3 :)
<OvergrownPegasus411> @MLP_Brovakiin All of the fandom is so nice.
<Alchemist> MaxTheBrony: and that sentence sounds very wrong out of context
<Cypresswolf> I think tomorrow will be a shopping day for when I leave for BFF friday...and need to settle on a schedule
<CCCP> i vist Bronystate because Im banned from everyother site on the web
<Applejack2012> I discovered this place in winter
<MaxTheBrony> Alchemist: haha yeah it does !
<tSparx> Vivix: Very true, I left 4chan YEARS before the birth of bronies.
<oni_link> So does anyone know her name?
<MaxTheBrony> Im not sure ive seen her before
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<Pikachu> im going to draw all of bronysate (well sort of ) what will be Canadian_brony , tSprax , And CCCP cuties marks be? (your choice)
<tSparx> oni_link: I don't. :/
<Vivix> yeah- and I found ponies via yt and images, general aniamtion interest and fan of such shows. Brony just happened to come along
<oni_link> aw :\
<Canadian_Brony> I found Bronystate after watching "Ballad of the Brony" a couple months ago. About one month before whenever the Tom awards started
<tSparx> Pikachu: I was talking with my BFF Victoria today about cutie marks, I don't think I could pick my own.
<cow334> Bff is only 2 hours away from me but I cant go to cause I have school
<cow334> ._. danm
<OvergrownPegasus411> My cutie mark shall be an nes controller. You can make any design you want except it has to have glassess.
<Pikachu> tSprax: lol
<CCCP> Pikachu http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg/200px-Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg.png
<MLP_Brovakiin> i must admit though bronystate is the reason that I have been staying up untill 5 am some mornings whatching films and chatting. it has completly ballsed up my sleeping pattern :P
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MaxTheBrony> dat Commie
<OvergrownPegasus411> And I am a female pony. Not a colt
<Pikachu> CCCP: kk
<AJIsAwesome> My initial views to MLP: FIM was switching from negative to neutral, until I decided to watch the show.
<Vivix> MLP_Brovakiin, me too ;__;
<MLP_Brovakiin> watching
<OvergrownPegasus411> NO. KITCHEN. JOKES.
<CCCP> :3
<Vivix> I was more or less instantly interested AJIsAwesome, I just-thought it looked so cute
<Pikachu> everyone will be done one by one :)

<tSparx> Pikachu: A helpful tip: if you start typing someone's name, and then press tab, it'll fill out the name for you -- and make sure you don't misspell it :D
<Kandarihu> Unless there's any canon evidence of cutie marks changing, an SNES controller for my ponification.
<MLP_Brovakiin> OvergrownPegasus411: Not everyone is like that
<oni_link> haha me too MLP_Brovakiin
<CCCP> yeah! what did kitchens ever do to you? :[
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> hehehe
<Pikachu> man i bad at spelling
<tSparx> So like pika [tab] becomes Pikachu :)
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<OvergrownPegasus411> They made me.. make sandwhiches :'(
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Yeah, I don't think I've had a normal sleep since I've found this place... Been watching the sun come up every day.
<Canadian_Brony> OvergrownPegasus411 colts and fillies are young ponies. Mares and stallions are when they've grown up.

<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome I found this through Ballad of the Brony too. I came late one night and they were streaming a comedian. I came back for movie night and "A Canterlot Wedding" premiere. Been coming back irregularilly ever since.
<OvergrownPegasus411> I am almost "old"
<Vivix> I think young is 1-16 and so forth
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo hmmph.
<MaxTheBrony> D: aw Vivix

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Fiineee~
<tSparx> I found this site through Ballad though :)
<oni_link> sub06905: disregard females, acquire pony glasses :P
<Alchemist> MaxTheBrony: depends on what context. In some aspects a 25 year old is still young
<sub06905> :D
<Vivix> old is when you start screaming at kids on the lawn Cypresswolf
<OvergrownPegasus411> How about you stream.... so many ways to play? :D
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: <3 Thanks~

<CrimsonPhoenix> lolcaps
<Applejack2012> nooo Scoot

<MLP_Brovakiin> Scoot-Scootaloo: We still love you <3 :D
<Cypresswolf> Old to me is when you start spotting grey hairs in your beard
*tSparx can barely even remember 16, even though it wasn't *too* long ago...

<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Then lets go out with a bang for you~ :)
<OvergrownPegasus411> Yeah the chat goes so fast.

<Dark92Something> OK, this is disturbing.......i'd like to find out about death MY WAY
<oni_link> Hello Ponyloverforever

<Pegasister6414> Can we watch another video?!
<Sumica> 00,10death is like boredome

<MLP_Brovakiin> I don't fear death, it'l happen it its own time
<FlutterMEDIC> can we please move on
<Whiskra> I think I came up with all this at the age of 10 or something... I was scared as hell of dying in that age
<OvergrownPegasus411> I'm eleven. I will still be alive when you are all dead. UMAD?
<Barbetos> Yep. That is life guys.
<Barbetos> It sucks
<cachi01|phone> Blahblahblahblah death blahblahblahblah porn blahblahblah
<tSparx> Ahem, y'all can press the *mute* button
<Dark92Something> GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!
<Dark92Something> Or you know
<Dark92Something> CUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, I already did
<Dovah> OvergrownPegasus411: unless you get hit by a care.
<Cypresswolf> I'm thinking about how many people I affected during life - isnt that all that matters?
<MLP_Brovakiin> OvergrownPegasus411: NOT IF I KILL YOU FIRST :P
<Dark92Something> CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!
<tSparx> OvergrownPegasus411: We only have like a 10 year gap
<Dovah> car*
<tSparx> OvergrownPegasus411: There's a great chance I'll outlive you
<MadSurge> This is making me sleepy
<Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: the atheist view is nihilist, trying to argue otherwise is to suggest something has abject meaning, and materialism rejects that. Thus nothing has meaning and thus nobody, not even yourself has meaning, that makes humanism pointless as humans are just an arrangment of molecules. Any meaning in an atheist viewpoint is a delusion.
<Dark92Something> Get it? I said CUUUUUT instead of KHAAAN
<oni_link> OvergrownPegasus411: nah I would have lived my life while youre still struggling through yours. Problem? *trollface*
<cachi01|phone> OvergrownPegasus411 im 14.....
<Cypresswolf> such a dim outlook on life :
<shibaru> The bad guy in his story, Remnants 8)
<OvergrownPegasus411> @oni_link FFFFUUUUUUU
<Cypresswolf> :|
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: I know several atheists who aren't materialists, first off.
<Pegasister6414> CAN WE WATCH SOMETHING ELSE?!
<Cades> oh
<Boodfire> this experiment is making me older, but none the wiser
<Buytoast> oh boy, do i see someone saying athiests are deluded?
<Buytoast> here we go
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: but its true, humans are just a pile of molecules.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hi Dark92Enigma
<tSparx> Oh god
<Kandarihu|1978> How can an atheist not be a materialist?
<Dovah> Pegasister6414: NO, dont complain about the stream, the streamer doesnt care
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: do they belive aliens give their lives meaning?
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we shouldn't have streamed this video...........:S
<Dovah> sup DoctoDoctorWho
<Ponyloverforever> anything on?...
<tSparx> Atheism = the belief that there are no deities
<OvergrownPegasus411> IGNORE THIS GUY, TOY FREAKIN STORY IS ON ABC FAMILY RIGHT NOW!
<ingwaz> atheism does not make one inherently better or worse than a theist
<oni_link> Hey, I love stuff and I found this offensive :D
<Dark92Something> Tell me Khan, does it cut to something else, tell me something!
<twilight_sprinkle> the only god i believe in is ROOOOOGER FEDERERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<Buytoast> according to Rex_Mundi it does
<tSparx> Atheism =/= the belief that the only things that are real are those which can be empirically measured
<MadSurge> Inb4 there's a screamer at the end :D
<OvergrownPegasus411> ^
<tSparx> That = Materialism
<Dovah> Science proved that god exists
<OvergrownPegasus411> Mute
<Pegasister6414> MUTE!
<tSparx> Dovah: I'm a Catholic, no it didn't
<OvergrownPegasus411> There we go
<twilight_sprinkle> Dovah: err no it didnt
<OvergrownPegasus411> Off to toy story
<shibaru> I get so excited when I hear him reply xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: Im fixing my house, a panzer battalion just blasted through
<Rex_Mundi> ingwaz: In an atheist, thus nihilistic view, it means that Atheists are exactly the same thing as theists, and also equally nothing
<OvergrownPegasus411> I'll be back once it's over
<tSparx> Dovah: Science will never prove that
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 intense debates......
<Cades> lol
<oni_link> And then the lord said, Let me resurrect these fresh beats!
*Dark92Something KHAN: i've done worse than leaving you alone.....i shall leave you like this video left everyone else......Buried Alive.....Buried Alive.....
<Cypresswolf> somewhere in this ramble, I forgot what he was talking about
<Dark92Something> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<Dark92Something> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<twilight_sprinkle> !NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHK
<Klumzeedragon> inb4 religion war :P
<Dovah> tSparx: science more or less explained the existance of god, trust me.
<OvergrownPegasus411> Aw man that's not cool scoots!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: They called it a god particle out of irony :S
<oni_link> pew pew
<OvergrownPegasus411> You troll!
<twilight_sprinkle> my religion is better than yours!
<Pegasister6414> I'm getting freaked out...
<Sumica> 00,10this guy re itterates alot
<tSparx> Dovah: "Trust me"
<tSparx> Dovah: HAHAHA
<Dovah> and DoctoDoctorWho ....
<tSparx> Dovah: No.
<prince-dari> Rex_Mundi, you're talking a load of bollocks to be honest
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway le food time, brb
<Buytoast> this guy is more boring that my ass on soft earth
<tSparx> You don't get to be a liberal Catholic by taking other people's views blindly.
<OvergrownPegasus411> And why are we watc hing this?
<Dark92Something> Oh hi DoctoDoctorWho Sorry i was busy bashing this video
<ingwaz> Rex_Mundi: i disagree with the nihilistic view completely
<cow334> thats it
<Dovah> tSparx: *sigh* dammit.... I cant post vidio links during stream otherwise i would.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back. How much of what did I miss?
<Klumzeedragon> Ima get some lemonade. brb everypony. :)
*cow334 shapes hand to a gun
<MLP_Brovakiin> I think phase linked this earlier http://theoatmeal.com/comics/religion
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: What, any meaning someone gives their life in an atheist viewpoint is just arbitrarily decided to give themselvs, its a delusion
<cow334> Pew pew kapowie
<Buytoast> at least Rex_Mundi is providing some kind of entertainment with his stupidity
<OvergrownPegasus411> Canadian Brony, get back to brb. Quickly
<MLP_Brovakiin> kinda relevent
<Dark92Something> How long is this?
<oni_link> wowwie zowwie
<OvergrownPegasus411> Can we get back to nightmare moon?
<cow334> die alieans
<Sumica> 00,10*facepalm*
<cow334> pew pew
<oni_link> kerpow blooosh
<MadSurge> Death=wait for games
<oni_link> ^
<OvergrownPegasus411> I mean nightmare fuel DERP
<Buytoast> hell, even i'd like to see ponies over this asshammering script reader
<Buytoast> and i never want ponies
<cachi01|phone> Death=waiting for HL3
<oni_link> ^
<OvergrownPegasus411> Nightmare Fuel > This Shit
<Canadian_Brony> so . . . what am I looking at?
<DerpyMuffins> So whats on stream?
<Canadian_Brony> I just got back
<tSparx> Dovah: I am a religious man. I am a scientific man. The two go together like PB&J, but you cannot prove or disprove the existence of an omnipotent deity, it contradicts the meanings of both science and the term omnipotent deity
<ingwaz> MLP_Brovakiin: that comic is just stupid because all it basically is saying is that the only good believer of any religion is one that does not even truly believe in their religion. that comic just wants people to shut up and not have any real belief
<DerpyMuffins> Been afk
<Rustymeat> WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Klumzeedragon> DerpyMuffins: Audio Log.
<Dark92Something> WE ARE GOING TO THAI :(
<cow334> Some people just cant handle change
<DerpyMuffins> Whose audio log?
<Rex_Mundi> Theists think god gives meaning to this world, atheists just arbitrarilu decided life has meaning for no reason other than it gives them happy thoughts. But in the atheist view, both those viewpoints are wrong. thus atheists are exactly the same as theists in everyway. both delusional pointless sacks of meat.
<ingwaz> tSparx: ahhh, i do so love when i meet someone who shares my view that religion and science are great together
<Dovah> tSparx: I never said he was omnipotent as a matter of fact i thing that is a bunch of BS
<Dark92Something> CHAAAAAAANGE! Ya got change!
<OvergrownPegasus411> Well I'm gonna watch get creative again
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|phone: http://blackmesasource.com/ does this doo :)
<tSparx> Dovah: Well, as I respectfully disagree...
<Pegasister6414> Is this over yet?
<cachi01|phone> Holy... SHIIIIIIIIT OMG MLP_Brovakiin
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|phone: ;)
<oni_link> my take on this, stuff happens. You'll die eventually. Just enjoy life
<tSparx> heh, love and tolerate... as long as we're not talking about those who believe in deities, or those who don't, or those who don't but still believe life has some meaning...
<prince-dari> "decided life has meaning for no reason other than it gives them happy thoughts. But in the atheist view, both those viewpoints are wrong" Who says they're wrong? You?
<Dovah> tSparx: Blraglflargplarplglzurger! I am trying to find the vidio so i can link it when there isnt a stream.
<Sumica> 00,10so is he saying he looks forward to death ?
<Dark92Something> Nostalgia Critic's Let's Play of ''Bart's Nightmare'' >>>>>> This video
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D
<Pegasister6414> @Sumica: I think so...
<tSparx> Dovah: Man, if the faith I've spent years building up can be debunked by one youtube video, I must be the dumbest person you've ever met >_>
<Kandarihu|1978> Dark92Something, is that a bad video?
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma agreed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica i dunno he repeats itslef a lot and it's confusing me so i stoped listening
<oni_link> lol
<Buytoast> this is like watching a nostalgia critic video
<Rustymeat> wait so what was his point?
<Dovah> tSparx: never meet you so....
<Pegasister6414> I don't get it...
<Sumica> 00,10that video much like his life is compresed and wasted
<cachi01|phone> Mah popcorn burn and taste like shit if i let them 6:66 in the microwave so CHECKMATE ATHEISTS
<MLP_Brovakiin> Well, that was deep
<MadSurge> Kandarihu|1978: one of the worst Doug Walker ever did
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: Im not making the positive statement, your saying life has meaning, im saying why do you think that? Its the same as theists saying God exists... just because.
<Kandarihu|1978> Buytoast, well, NC talks about fun stuff.
<MadSurge> Oh this!
<OvergrownPegasus411> OH THANK GOD
<MadSurge> SATAN
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo you really like creepy videos right ? :p
<Rustymeat> Hail satan!
<Buytoast> i've never seen him talk about anything fun or be funny himself
<Canadian_Brony> Kandarihu|1978 it was created with the sole purposes of A) give NC a small break B) make a running gag in the next vdeo funny
<Buytoast> also oh boy
<prince-dari> Life has meaning to an individual, it's not an inherent thing.
<OvergrownPegasus411> Hai satan! Nice to meet you!
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Sure, yeah, it's postulated. And? You either have to assume a deity (or deities) exist, or that it doesn't.
<Silver_Spoon> What is this? o_o
<Dark92Something> Kandarihu|1978: let's say he tired to do something different: PLAY videogames instead of reviewing them......sadly, he doesn't have the patience of a regular gamer, so he ragequitted, and went back to movies
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: If that's all you're trying to say, I totally agree.
<Dovah> tSparx: also its not a youtube video its a full episode.
<sub06905> lets get creative!
<Kandarihu|1978> Dark92Something, I see.
<twilight_sprinkle> pineapples please
<Canadian_Brony> I heard "purist"
<Pegasister6414> What is this...?
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: care to explain how kife has meaning?
<Dark92Something> Kandarihu|1978: he reviewed only 2 games: Bebe's Kids and Blue's Brothers
<MadSurge> FRUIT
<OvergrownPegasus411> Oranges! With smiley faces!
<Kandarihu|1978> Both of them based on movies
<OvergrownPegasus411> Walking along a street
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: I assume it does, or, rather, I make a set of assumption that implies that life has meaning.
<MadSurge> Pegasister6414: part of a special on Mark Twain
<MLP_Brovakiin> The meaning of life, the universe and everything is 42
<sub06905> ^
<Silver_Spoon> Oh, it's a thing based on that Mark Twain Book, I see
<twilight_sprinkle> The meaning of life is Twilights plot
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: NO~! That's the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything.
<MadSurge> Silver_Spoon: yes
<Dark92Something> Kandarihu|1978: EXACTLY......And he reviewed the Bebe's Kids movie, remember?
<DerpyMuffins> This is creepy
<DerpyMuffins> Like really creepy
<Canadian_Brony> O___________O
<soulrider95> How about we all stop arguing about who is right? We can never know which side of the argument is correct, and should just enjoy life as it happens!!!
<Rustymeat> DEATH
<Kandarihu|1978> Blues Brothers is this next weekend's B Movie, right?
<Rustymeat> yes
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: the creepy part is yet to come
<cow334> NOOOO
<Ponyloverforever> Hi im back

<tSparx> soulrider95: How bout you not tell me what to do, punk. :P
<oni_link> soulrider95: my thoughts exactly
<Dark92Something> OH IT'S THE CHIPMUNKS! RUUUUUUUN

<Canadian_Brony> WB Ponyloverforever
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nah~
<Ponyloverforever> and what is this!? O_O
<cachi01|phone> :(
<Pegasister6414> O_o
<Dark92Something> Kandarihu|1978: EEEEEEEYUP
<DerpyMuffins> Is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming?
<prince-dari> Rex_Mundi: The meaning for me would just be to enjoy life.
<Rex_Mundi> Too many people, most atheists and theists alike are exactly the same. Nobody challenges their own philosophical belifes. I believe in God because i decided that was logical.
<MadSurge> DED
<Pegasister6414> :'(
<prince-dari> For other people it might be to make a difference to the world
<Kandarihu|1978> In that case, it would be great if someone were to do a playthrough of the Blues Brothers game after BMN
<prince-dari> I don't see what point you're trying to make
<cachi01|phone> and then...... Murder
<OvergrownPegasus411> ........
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: make a difference... why?
<MadSurge> EARTHQUAKE
<Ponyloverforever> poor clay ppl :(
<Pegasister6414> Well, I'm not going to bed.
<Dark92Something> Kandarihu|1978: Good luck with that somepony.....

<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek muffins :D
<Ponyloverforever> not the cow :'(
<prince-dari> I don't know, that's not what I want, ask someone who does, I suppose because they want to feel they've used their life to do some good, and to leave a mark on the world.
<DerpyMuffins> Hi SuperBrony64
<cow334> Tha poor cow
<OvergrownPegasus411> MOOOM..... WHATS HAPPPENNNIIIING
<prince-dari> Maybe they want to be remembered, they're scared of being forgotten when they die
<Kandarihu|1978> SuperBrony64, can you make it happen?
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: so what is "good"?
*MLP_Brovakiin gives SuperBrony64 a muffin :3
<Pegasister6414> I'm scared now...
<Ponyloverforever> what is this called?
<OvergrownPegasus411> Yeah?
<DerpyMuffins> This is really creepy now
<x1es> Did someone mention muffins?
<prince-dari> Usually helping people in 3rd world countries
<oni_link> everytime i see this http://three-sigma.blogspot.com/2011/07/lets-see-what-weve-got.html
<twilight_sprinkle> well yes, for me life isnt about enkoying it because that can be egoistic. for me its more about makingthe world better
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: so why is that "good"?
<cow334> Dat love
*SuperBrony64 noms on the muffin
<MadSurge> This was Mark Twain's depressing period, people
<tSparx> And that's when prince-dari switched to fucking with Rex_Mundi xD
<prince-dari> Because that's how society views it
<Pegasister6414> Uh...
<MadSurge> :O MR ROGERS
<cachi01|phone> Lolwut
<Ponyloverforever> clay people to this?
<oni_link> i didnt link correctly.
<oni_link> ignore
<Canadian_Brony> k
<DerpyMuffins> WTF we watching?
<DerpyMuffins> Its just so random
<cow334> steve rodgers....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We ain't watching ponies~
<cachi01|phone> Mr rogers in a bloodstein sweater
<tSparx> Well this is Mr. Rogers winning something
<cow334> he so amazing
<MLP_Brovakiin> prince-dari: I'm gunna change my name into every significant wiki page ever, so it will take along time to froget me :D
<Pegasister6414> LETS WATCH MOAR PONIES!
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: so your belifes are what you parrot what society has told you?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No.
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyMuffins whatever the buck Scoots wants to stream
<cachi01|phone> THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SHOOOWDOWN
<cachi01|phone> And again
<cow334> Woot woot ^^
<prince-dari> You said that, not me.
<DerpyMuffins> That you steaming Scoot-Scootaloo?
<MadSurge> Pegasister6414: never ask for ponies, you'll get anything but G4
<DerpDash> Hey everypony! :) Whos streaming and whatre we watching?
<prince-dari> But what's socially acceptable, what's good, what's bad, that does come from society
<oni_link> aw I remember this man :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello DerpDash :)
<OvergrownPegasus411> Creepy stuff! Creepy stuff!
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge G3 :/
<Canadian_Brony> hi DerpDash Scoots is streaming . . . stuff
<Dark92Something> SuperBrony64: We have a request for you.......it so happens that next week the Blue's Brothers movie will be up for this movie weekend, so if that's OK with you.....can you do the playthrough for the Blue Brother's videogame? WE won't blame you for ragequitting when it happens......
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: or G2
<DoctoDoctorWho> I thought mr rogers was dead, go figure
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: thats the kind of reasoning that christians who never read the bible use.
<Kandarihu|1978> Fred Rogers pretty much started the self esteem movement. I guess he meant well with it, but it's been corrupted, like so many thing
<Buytoast> he is dead
<DerpDash> Canadian_Brony: ahh :P
<OvergrownPegasus411> I really want to see more creepy stuff
<prince-dari> That's how it is
<prince-dari> Nothing is inherently 'good' or 'bad'
<cow334> no one type
<Rustymeat> SADFACE
<prince-dari> We had slaves in this country at one point, and everyone was fine with it, it wasn't bad.
<Cades> shit
<Pegasister6414> OvergrownPegasus411: Why?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dark92Enigma: Okie, but we're not watching Blues Brothers next weekend.
<prince-dari> Society's view on it changed
<Dovah> i was thinking about a cookie..
<prince-dari> And it became 'bad'
<oni_link> right in my feels :(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03wow... that WAS ten seconds..
<cow334> Scoot-Scootaloo: woot woot
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo IKR?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I counted :3
<prince-dari> That's just how things work.
<Canadian_Brony> I counted too
<OvergrownPegasus411> I really want scary tuff :)
<Kandarihu|1978> What God, in all of his love, deems to be good is good. What he deems to be evil is evil. It doesn't matter whether society agrees or disagrees.
<MadSurge> Awww <3
<prince-dari> It isn't some view that I hold
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: so your saying im right? assuming the atheist viewpoint... that I dont ascribe too.:D
<prince-dari> How am I saying that?
<Buytoast> boy you jsut keep asserting yiou're right don;t you
<MadSurge> Wut
<oni_link> WHY U DO THIS Scoot-Scootaloo
<Pegasister6414> What's this?
<cachi01|phone> Le.wild.music vid
<tSparx> HURT
<Canadian_Brony> 10 seconds isn't long enough for me to think about all the people who influenced my life. Too many people.
<MadSurge> JOHNNY CASH
<tSparx> by Nine Inch Nails
<tSparx> as performed by Johny Cash
<Rex_Mundi> I was saying the atheist view is inherrintly nihilistic. And you just said just that.
<DoctoDoctorWho> he just sounds like a nice guy, not like a child rapist nice, just legitly nice. we need more people like him.
<MLP_Brovakiin> GET THIS MAN A PLASTER
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: no we need a panzer battalion.
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: you mean Mr Rogers?
<Kandarihu|1978> MLP_Brovakiin, he's dead now.
<Canadian_Brony> song name?
<Canadian_Brony> plz?
<Buytoast> mr rogers was a good guy
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Do you know what nihilistic means? Moral relativism =/= nihilism.
<prince-dari> Actually, what I called you out on was this
<prince-dari> [00:23] <Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: the atheist view is nihilist, trying to argue otherwise is to suggest something has abject meaning, and materialism rejects that. Thus nothing has meaning and thus nobody, not even yourself has meaning, that makes humanism pointless as humans are just an arrangment of molecules. Any meaning in an atheist viewpoint is a delusion.
<Buytoast> he doesn't know what it means
<cow334> DANM
<prince-dari> Because it's clearly bullshit
<Buytoast> but it sounds like a fancy word
<OvergrownPegasus411> Scary stuff plz?
<cachi01|phone> Cool song is cool
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kandarihu|1978: Did no one hear when he hurt himself :(
<Buytoast> so he'll just use it
<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah, rogers 4ever
<Buytoast> to sound important
<Pegasister6414> Empire of dirt?
<MadSurge> Mr Rogers would have liked ponies :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: always will
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: This is just a cover of a NIN song
<prince-dari> You can't 'reason' that "nothing has meaning"
<Canadian_Brony> What is the name of this song?
<prince-dari> That doesn't make any sense
<cachi01|phone> tSparx a pretty nice cover
*MLP_Brovakiin is awefully confused again :/
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Johnny Cash's version of Hurt
<tSparx> cachi01|phone: I consider it equal to the original.
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: That was exactkly what i was saying from the start! yay!
<Canadian_Brony> k
*Pegasister6414 is confused
<prince-dari> Yes, that's what you said at the start, and it's rubbish
<MadSurge> prince-dari: so meaning has no meaning, which has no meaning, which has no meaning and so and so on :D
<Silver_Spoon> The meaning of life is to make mistakes...and then surpass them
<cachi01|phone> ^ yo dawg
*tSparx is a theology major... and is still very confused...
<oni_link> I can respect Mr Cash becase he wrote music, Elvis on the other hand...
<Rex_Mundi> If the atheist point is the truth than there is no meaning and thus all morality and virtue are dilusions
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Atheism is just the abscence in belief of an all-mighty being, not the absence of belief.
<sub06905> this song
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: That's not necessarily true.
<Pegasister6414> WHY DOES HE WANT AN EMPIRE OF DIRT?!
<prince-dari> What is your definition of dilusion?
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: And it's frustrating that you keep saying that.
<Rex_Mundi> Not truth?
*sub06905 gets creative
<prince-dari> delusion*
<cow334> Pegasister6414: People like what they like
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Atheism is a big tent.
<pony_7007> chills
<Buytoast> this whole conversation ain't going to end. the guy's name means "King of the World", he has a bigger ego than duke nukem
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Lots of different people believe lots of different things.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Humanity needs purpose, without it, we are useless
<MadSurge> Sir Cash :(
<cow334> I would want an empire of water that would be pretty cool
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Lots of different atheists believe lots of different thigns.
<Dovah> "Through the Wormhole Season 3 Episode 10: Did We Invent God?"
<Buytoast> you'd have a better time trying to convince a black man he's white
<NullRadix> I go off, shower and eat some after-workout ice cream and you guys are still talking religion
<cachi01|phone> BRUSHIE BRUHIE
<Kandarihu|1978> Silver_Spoon, that's an important part of life. Can't call it the meaning of life. However, we must be careful not to make mistakes we can never come from.
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: Heh! Im not the one who started the theolicakl debate!
<Rex_Mundi> theological
<Buytoast> you did you stupid fucker
<prince-dari> So you say that morality and virtue are delusions because they aren't inherently there?
<tSparx> NullRadix: Yep, 'cause as it turns out we can talk about what we want as long as mods don't start waving the banhammer :)
<Pegasister6414> What is this?
<oni_link> I thought that kid was peeing at first
<MadSurge> Eeeehhh, I gotta go to bed guys. Nighty <3
<prince-dari> Because I say that's a stupid argument
<cachi01|phone> ^^^
<oni_link> nigght MadSurge
<cow334> night MadSurge
<tSparx> prince-dari: Well, what he's saying is that IF atheism is true, then yes
<cachi01|phone> Night MadSurge
<Silver_Spoon> Kandarihu|1978: maybe surpass the deadly ones before they kill you :)
<Canadian_Brony> seeya MadSurge
<Cypresswolf> is this a Coldplay song?
<tSparx> prince-dari: I disagree, but that's a much LESS stupid argument xD
<OvergrownPegasus411> More scary stuff please? :(
*sub06905 stays out of this religon talk
<oni_link> BRB gonna make a sandwich
<MLP_Brovakiin> I thought all of this was explaned in 'Passion of the christ 2:So much passion' :D
<Rex_Mundi> I just dont think you give a good argument for "Why" to these things and just run on assumptions.
<Barbetos> Opinions are over rated.
<MLP_Brovakiin> *: so
<ingwaz> there can be meaning in life even if the atheist's view point was true
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: All we can do is run on assumption.
<OvergrownPegasus411> *slowly backs aqay from the argument*
<cachi01|phone> OvergrownPegasus411 just go and google MLP G3 but beware. Its fucking scary
<DoctoDoctorWho> me/ m
<tSparx> That's what *faith* is all about, after all xD
<Barbetos> I just like to have a good idea of how things factually work.
<Pegasister6414> Teddy?
<prince-dari> You're basically saying that anything we've 'made up' is a delusion
<Buytoast> "they're tearing my argument apart! I know, I'll attack their arguments rather than defend mine!" - Rex_Mundi
<prince-dari> And therefore "isn't real"
<Pegasister6414> I don't get this...
<Rex_Mundi> Assuming a fully materialistic world, then yes.
<Petrified_Discord> And then we changed the subject and didn't talk about this anymore. Kay? :)
<cachi01|phone> Did he killed himself?
<tSparx> Petrified_Discord: Haha no
<Pegasister6414> He's killing himself!
<Kandarihu|1978> Silver_Spoon, just be careful to never make the mistakes that cannot be undone.
<Petrified_Discord> tSparx: Darn :D
*MLP_Brovakiin is gonna start a new planet without religion so there are less wars and arguments
<Dovah> Zues, Ra and others were around way befor God, they were real to Greeks and Egyptians, God is real to Christians.
<prince-dari> We made up names for everything, language. The fact that these things also hold meaning to us must be "delusion" to you also then.
<soulrider95> MLP_Brovakiin: May I join you on this planet?
<cachi01|phone> MLP_Brovakiin there would be more wars instead....
<Barbetos> MLP_Brovakiin you would have to remove the human factor.
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|phone: Most wars are started due to religion :/
<shibaru> I just finished watchinf return of jafar and now I'm wondering... why didn't they just destroy jafar's lamp at the end of the first one? o.o
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Man, you think atheists aren't gonna find just as many things to argue about? It's a human thing, not just a religious thing
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: Yes, nihil can create only nihil. Meaning from meannglessness is impossible.
<DoctoDoctorWho> MLP_Brovakiin: the more solutions we make the the more problems that surface to replace them.
<Cades> lol
<Canadian_Brony> I am not a religious man. I will not add more to this conversation.
<Kandarihu|1978> The deadly mistakes are obvious. The ones that can end freedom... well, they get a lot of good publicity.
<MLP_Brovakiin> tSparx: We would argue about what is on tv, not who to praise!
<cachi01|phone> MLP_Brovakiin and most of them by atheists.... Dude if u make a planet full of atheists everyone would do whatever the fuck they want
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: most wars in the past were caused IN THE NAME of religion, but even if we didn't have it, there's always something else to argue about
<shibaru> That would have saved a lot of time and pain, wouldn't it
<Silver_Spoon> Kandarihu|1978: better than I could have said. I'm a filly, not a Philosopher
<Silver_Spoon> :P
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: I'd contend that NONE of the major wars in the last hundred years were started due to religion/
<Buytoast> war on terror
<Cades> idk haha i dont even know if ive watched the movie :P
<prince-dari> But that's a stupid argument
<Buytoast> DIRTY MUSLIM TURRISTS
<Dovah> jews?
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx that is't true
<MLP_Brovakiin> On my planet if shit goes down, I would personally ice whatever mother trucker who dares stand in my way :D
<prince-dari> That's just an argument for argument's sake
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, the worst mass casualty events in the 20th century were caused by atheists. And the two worst ones weren't even a matter of war.
<tSparx> Buytoast: Is a euphemism
<prince-dari> Because the words clearly do have meaning to me
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Oh yeah?
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx WWII
<Pegasister6414> What is this?
<OvergrownPegasus411> Uh... friendship is magic? Respect peoples opinions anypony? :S
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Started due to HItler's acts of agression
<MLP_Brovakiin> OvergrownPegasus411: Agreed
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx partially against religion
<Pegasister6414> bunny1
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx if not mainly
<StinkomanFan> ohey Bunnies
<Dovah> Hey everybody, let's all attack Scoot-Scootaloo. He is probobly siting there with a troll face for starting this...
<Kandarihu|1978> I swear. Scoot is streaming almost nothing but creepypasta and otherwise depressive videos.
<Pegasister6414> Bunny!
<Buytoast> How dare you still argue against Rex "King of the World" Mundi! Don't you know his word is automatically truth?
<cachi01|phone> Scoot-scootaloo can u stream ready to die? Pls :)
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: He had plenty of other reasons he was going to war besides his hatred of jews.
<Petrified_Discord> Guys, BUNNIES. Look at all of these BUNNIES! :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >be Afk for a while > return to Religious wars Theist vs atheist i better go AFK again
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx they were a factor.
*DoctoDoctorWho decides to let this handle itself and not get involved
<CrossChop114> Um... Hi. What are we watching?
<Pegasister6414> Aww, bunnies! ^^
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: Like his belief that Germany was due to rule the world
<Rex_Mundi> prince-dari: And what are you?
<StinkomanFan> Wait, Scoot-Scootaloo's streaming?
<OvergrownPegasus411> I wanna see more videos like don't hug me I'm scared. *insane face*
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: But they weren't the root cause.
<prince-dari> A human?
*Dovah Drags DoctoDoctorWho back into the arguement.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Eh, no regrets.
<Petrified_Discord> Rotten fruit?
<Kandarihu|1978> StinkomanFan, eeyup. It's his last time streaming in a long time.
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx also, who caused 9/11?
<Rex_Mundi> What is man but a miserable pile of secrets?6_9
<DerpyMuffins> What is this?
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: That wasn't a war.
<Pegasister6414> This is adorable! :)
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx Bush declared war
<cachi01|phone> Canadian_Brony bush.....
<Canadian_Brony> BUSH
<Petrified_Discord> Rex_Mundi: But enough talk. Have at you!
<Canadian_Brony> I HATE HIM
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey what about all of that shizzle about palestine vs isreal?
<Canadian_Brony> that is all
<cachi01|phone> FUCKING BUSH
<MLP_Brovakiin> That was a war about religion
<StinkomanFan> So I missed the Requests?
<Kandarihu|1978> Canadian_Brony, Islamic terrorists caused 9/11
<Pegasister6414> Can we watch cupcakes?
<DerpyMuffins> No
*DoctoDoctorWho becomes switzerland and MINDS ITS OWN F***ING BUSINESS, like a boss.
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: It's not a declared war. Only the US congress can declare war, the President can't
<OvergrownPegasus411> YOUR OPINION IS DIFFERENT THEN MINE. THUS I SHALL ARGUE FOR A FREAKIN LONG TIME
<MLP_Brovakiin> Pegasister6414: Nope
<FlutterMEDIC> wait, the Crusades was about Religion
*Dovah Invades Switzerland.
<StinkomanFan> Medic is hero!
<CrossChop114> I needed something to watch while I played Dragon Quest VIII and I'm not even sure what this is.
<CrossChop114> O hi, Medic.
<Canadian_Brony> nevermind
<cachi01|phone> MEEEEDIIIC
<tSparx> FlutterMEDIC: Last hundred years. I'm not arguing that religion hasn't caused tons of bloodshed -- totally has!
<cow334> Love this video
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: lol
<Petrified_Discord> Yay uplifting video
<Pegasister6414> MEDIC!
<Canadian_Brony> I'm out of this conversation
<oni_link> oh i saw this vid, is good vid
<tSparx> FlutterMEDIC: But I'm saying, we can (and even have) found something else to war about
<Sumica> 00,10knew this was coming
<cow334> even with medic saying it
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, Congress doesn't declare war. Congress has to give the President the authorization to declare war, and they did.
<Rex_Mundi> In anycase, im not a believer in a fully materialistic reality. Spiritualism exists. Not soul crushingly depressingly that way...
<OvergrownPegasus411> *crosses hooves for creepy video*
<Silver_Spoon> This video is appropriate
<CrossChop114> I love Shwiggen's videos.
<cow334> inspireing qoute right here get ready
<cow334> woot woot
<FlutterMEDIC> tSparx: albeit that most of these wars are REALLY pointless
<Buytoast> ahahaha, he's run out of shit to shovel into his argument
<DoctoDoctorWho> Medic for president 2012
<cachi01|phone> HATS
<Cypresswolf> Charlie Chaplin?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Eh, I'm getting bored of feels~
<Pegasister6414> OvergrownPegasus411: I want creepy videos too. :P
<FlutterMEDIC> Cypresswolf: Charlie Chaplin
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03even bad feels
<cachi01|phone> Dr goku for presidente de mexico :3
<Dovah> Scoot-Scootaloo: you a damn Troll, you. :|
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo that's not a good sign
<Canadian_Brony> is it?
<tSparx> I'm just saying: WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, all caused for reasons that weren't religious.
<OvergrownPegasus411> Who here wants feels? I so want feels
<oni_link> IMO wars were made for countries to boost their economies
<MLP_Brovakiin> I kinda like Buddism, they are just like we are Buddists and we don't care if you are not
<Canadian_Brony> okay, yeah, I'm sick of the feels too
<DoctoDoctorWho> Medic is best president
<FlutterMEDIC> guess what role Charlie played in this movie.
<cachi01|phone> FlutterMEDIC hitler
<FlutterMEDIC> cachi01|phone: a PARODY of Hitler
<Pegasister6414> Kettle?
<tSparx> Even if Afghanistan was.
<Rex_Mundi> Im too much of a history buff to just simply say wars are caused by religion or not. its never that simple, even the crusades had complex social-economic reasons.
<Kandarihu|1978> This video needs to be redone with MvM assets
<shibaru> What to watch next.... I don't have Aladdin 3 so...
<cachi01|phone> FlutterMEDIC yeah i remember when it was streamed here lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> YOU HAVE THE POWER!
<Petrified_Discord> It's pretty impressive that a silent comedian could use such powerful words.
<Alchemist> Rex_Mundi: even if religions didnt start wars directly, they were great tools
<tSparx> MLP_Brovakiin: Jews are the same way too. They're a non-proselytizing religion
<FlutterMEDIC> BEST. CHARLIE. CHAPLIN. EVER!
<CCCP> Hello everypony
<StinkomanFan> YAAAAAAAY
<Kandarihu|1978> Well, Charlie Chaplain played both an expy of Hitler, and a Jew living in an expy of 1930's Germany.
<Canadian_Brony> hi CCCP
<cachi01|phone> Hi CCCP!
<cow334> woot woot

<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: I know it was hitler, they just look the same :D
<Pegasister6414> Hi, CCCP! :)
<Petrified_Discord> The staaaaaaaaaaaaars, the mooooooon
<alexxm> how you doing DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Its Muffins not hooves
<Kandarihu|1978> Crusades and Spanish Inquisition aside, Christians don't start wars in order to spread the faith. Muslims do.
<FlutterMEDIC> the lipsync is spectacular!
<JRPhone> MrPoniator: stop being shy
<CCCP> i like this PMV
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: WHOA

<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu|1978: Oh what do you know of Islam?
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: Certain ultra-conservative sects do, and political factions have used it as a cover for wars.
<FlutterMEDIC> night GilDash
<Alchemist> Kandarihu|1978: erm, more like fundamentalists, and fundamentalists are usually batshit crazy, no matter what religion they have

<oni_link> hello JRPhone
<FlutterMEDIC> hi JRPhone
<cow334> hello JRP
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: I am not gonna have people dissing Muslims. They are a peace-loving ethno-religious group, who've been poorly portrayed in the West
<cow334> JRPhone:

<MLP_Brovakiin> SO MANY HELLO :S
<StinkomanFan> This PMV is overrated
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: I still have to do more research and learn Japanese :D I dont know exactly where I would go
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: Medics speech was, beutiful...:'(
<CCCP> *glomps NotIshBestPony not matter if he wants to or not*
<AJIsAwesome> I went to Japan during the summer a couple of years ago.
<FlutterMEDIC> AJIsAwesome: if it werent for one thing...
*tSparx believes that all people can be good, no matter who they are or what they believe...
<NotIshBestPony> StinkomanFan I agree with you
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Me too. I'm trying to take some Japanes classes.
<CCCP> StinkomanFan Nope
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, like Egyptians who just elected hardline Muslim Brotherhood associate Muhhamed Morsi, who is leading the charge to reform the Islamic Caliphate?
<NotIshBestPony> CCCP yep
<Dovah> derpl.
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: Well, a) 1/5th of Egyptians are Christians
<MLP_Brovakiin> Why not praise zoidberg?
<FlutterMEDIC> AJIsAwesome: you know what i mean about Nagasaki right?
<Pinkie1028> Hai, bronies and pegasisters! ^^
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: Well, all things are overrated when it gets too much attention. At least that's my opinion.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: any luck ? I have to look around to see if my community has any classes
<CCCP> NotIshBestPony *hugs passionatly*
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai Pinkie1028
<Dovah> did my chat die?
<cow334> hello Pinkie1028
<Canadian_Brony> hi Pinkie1028
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Nope.
<CrossChop114> :D
<cow334> woot woot
<cow334> Awww yeah
<cachi01|phone> YAY
<AJIsAwesome> FlutterMEDIC: Radiation?
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: B) The politics of a post-revolution society are almost always confusing, and Egypt's no exception.
<CrossChop114> So much happies.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: damn. that sucks
<Petrified_Discord> Anti-sadness batteries, FIRE!
<ingwaz> AJIsAwesome: you sound like a hipster, ITS TOO MANESTREAM
*NotIshBestPony throws CCCP off a clip even though he is clearly not IshBestPony
<MLP_Brovakiin> YAY moodchanger :)
<JRPhone> I made a song about fluttershy
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, those Christians are heavily persecuted right now. They were as of the Arab Spring and they're being persecuted even worse now.
<AJIsAwesome> ingwaz: DAT HORSE PUN.
<NotIshBestPony> *cliff
<FlutterMEDIC> AJIsAwesome: well...thats part of the answer i'm looking for...
*DoctoDoctorWho h
*oni_link is being thrown off with all these mood swings
<Dovah> anyway brb everypony I'll be back in a few hours
<Pinkie1028> Smile, smile, smile!
<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: Essentially what happened is that the candidates most egyptians wanted were eliminated because the vote was spread too thin, and he was the guy they had left
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Dovah
<Alchemist> Just think about what would happen if Fred or Shirley Phelps got elected as president of the US... :D
<shibaru> I wish I had the Hunchback of Notre Dame o_o
*DoctoDoctorWho smiles against his will
<AJIsAwesome> ingwaz: To be honest, I'm not a hipster. I was just joking.
<Pinkie1028> ?me sings alond and smiles
*NotIshBestPony takes DoctoDoctorWho's teeth while he smiles

<tSparx> Kandarihu|1978: Egyptian Muslim took to the streets this Christmas to act as human shields for Christians

<prince-dari> Laggy
<NotIshBestPony> otakon what are attempting to ask?
<prince-dari> <:
<tSparx> Why do people gotta hate? Hm? Why can't we love and tolerate EVERYONE? Regardless of their religion or lack thereof, regardless of what bands they're in or into, of what they like or don't, of whatever philosophical beliefs they hold? I don't have enough energy to hate much :P
<DashWithRainbows> MFW RainBroDash, is here, in bronystate, after how long...?

<RougeFlutter> LOL
<Ryunosuke> tSparx, I find people hate simply out of ignorance, they dont understand something, thus they fear it, that leads to hate
<cachi01|phone> XDDD
<Petrified_Discord> SPAGHETTI is in bloom
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay this :D
<DerpyMuffins> Spaghetti?

<RougeFlutter> this is fucking great
<StinkomanFan> I HOPE SHE MAKES LOTSA SPAGHTTI
<Kandarihu|1978> tSparx, we have to be able to see hatred and evil for what it is. Returning hatred with hatred is only making the problem worse. But ignoring that bad things is just as bad.
<Franek12354> This ruined the song!

<tSparx> RougeFlutter: I do not, nor do I intend to get it anytime soon. I already have enough time sinks :P
<Kandarihu|1978> I actually came to a crossroads when I was about to turn 13. Whether I was going to act my age, and just do the things that a teenager was expected to be into, or stick with what I love. Tiny Toon Adventures premiered that September, and I chose the latter.
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, I DISPISE monkeys
<NotIshBestPony> Who voices Darwin?
<RougeFlutter> tSparx: Oh ok lolz
<StinkomanFan> ...That Rhino has hair.
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu|1978: Good choice.
<cachi01|phone> You die being a good show. Or you live long enough to see yourself becoming a shitty show. Example: the simpsons
<RougeFlutter> Minecraft server: mc.emenbeesmp.com
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't rhino's have hair?

<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: yea, trying to get it all loaded up on DA stash
<Kandarihu|1978> The monkey isn't being racist. It's being a monkey. Comparing people of African descent to monkeys... THAT'S racist.
<cow334> taking a rinos horn
<oni_link> Did you guys like Freakazoid? That was my favorite cartoon next to the 90s animated Batman
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: she remembered you
<FlutterMEDIC> who here agrees that Animaniacs was a great show?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'd love to see it! And you told her about me...? :3c

<NotIshBestPony> Izzat Betty White?
<RougeFlutter> Rex_Mundi: i loved rugrats, but not that new one with the teens

<FlutterMEDIC> Ed, Edd, n' Eddy was a great show.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: they need to bring back that show :( i used to love all the stabs at pop culture they did and the bits where Freakazoid butchered classical pieces always made me laugh

<NotIshBestPony> Darwin is voiced by Tom Kane http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kane
<FlutterMEDIC> i have to say my favorite joke from Freakazoid was the lipsync bit.
<otakon> seriously, eating your young seems ver counter productive
<Kandarihu|1978> Even after I was over that "respectfully boycotting Nick" phase, I never really got into Nick.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Agreed.:D
<cow334> the imagination video was awesome
<cow334> except for that one part O-O

<tSparx> cachi01|phone: Mystery
<Buytoast> she revealed the secret or somethin
<tSparx> Or that
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu|1978: because insects are inferior beings
<oni_link> hmm, the TF2 beta is updating...

<Vivix> "The United States Pony Club defines "pony" to be any mount that is ridden by a member regardless of its breed or size. Persons up to 25 years old are eligible for membership, and some of the members' "ponies" actually are full-size horses."
<FlutterMEDIC> movie is horrible though
*Vivix useless facts, but funny
<cachi01|phone> FlutterMEDIC yeah the movie was bad
<FlutterMEDIC> Vivix: that could also be taken out of context as well.
<Cades> i :p too much :P
<Vivix> could be, I'm reading about the definition of pony in Wikipedia
<Rex_Mundi> if he had played moonlight sonata, then a secret passage would have opened up.

<StinkomanFan> I must've missed it Scoot
<shibaru> I think about Mike too much
<Vivix> I don't think it is, mainly because I don't know any slender stuff
<AJIsAwesome> I found out what happends when you collect all 8 pages. You still get killed.:|
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Vivix> I startle- but you know-
<Cades> mike thinks about mike too much

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica first join first serve ?
<Cades> dammit one of my favorite artists just released a tune and i cant listen to it :(
<FlutterMEDIC> another scary game is SCP Containment Breach
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I guess you can say that dance party was... heating up!
<cachi01|phone> Vivix Slender is not HIS name.... His name is slenderman
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm here ^-^
<Rex_Mundi> Whats Slender man?
<sub06905> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Sumica> 00,10yeah TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Vivix> cachi01|phone, the game is called Slender
<Cynder7> 6D:
<cachi01|phone> Vivix yeah i know but some people call slenderman slender
<Vivix> I'm pretty sure slenderman was created by many people, but the creator of that specific game had a really cool entry for Ludum Dare
<Buytoast> watch her lead them to the fire itself
<Cynder7> 6Why don't you go online through your PS3?
<Pearly> Pearly has returned
<FlutterMEDIC> Vivix: another scary game is SCP Containment Breach
<Buytoast> you lying bastard animals
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Pearly
<Cades> i could do that i guess
<Vivix> FlutterMEDIC, yeah I kinda liked that one, was very unfinished when I tried ti though
<cachi01|phone> Vivix slenderman was created for a somethingawful.com contest
<Pearly> hey FlutterMEDIC
<Slenderman> ...
<ingwaz> cachi01|phone: he prefers his close personal friends call him slendy though
<cachi01|phone> The story won
<Vivix> Ah, Slender looks a lot like "The tall man" from Yahtzees horror game series from--early 2000's
<Cades> k ill do that lol
<StinkomanFan> Rex_Mundi, Slenderman is an urban legend about a tall creature who kills and tortures random people, mostly children
<Cynder7> 6What's the artist called btw?
<Slenderman> sounds about right
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back
<Canadian_Brony> for now
<Cades> contrage
<cachi01|phone> StinkomanFan just people that think their lifw has no value
<Vivix> It's a created legend, so not everyone thinks its interesting
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Cades> or bratkilla
<cachi01|phone> Those are his victims
<Canadian_Brony> Hmm . . . I'veseen this before, but can't put my hoof on it.
<FlutterMEDIC> BOIDS
<Cades> its kinda confusing cuz theyre the same people, but he just has seperate names for serperate types of music
<Vivix> I thought the tall man was scarier, but he was part of the story in the game
<Rex_Mundi> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1v8lfJ8vE1r3k1m8o1_500.png
<Cynder7> 6:O

<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, aah- never seen anyone play it to the end
<StinkomanFan> Actually, the Slenderman seems to kill at random,

<FlutterMEDIC> Vivix: ending = death
<Slenderman> semi-random, but yeah
<Vivix> slender looks a lot like this guy http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/275/005/7c0.jpg who predates him

<shibaru> "Lol, I wish someone would give me a dollar every time I told you I love you. Then I'd use all that money to come see you and tell you I love you more, then use that money for uhhhh... whatever you want me to :D" That would be wonderful XD
<StinkomanFan> Don't worry, Slenderman only kills those who believe in him
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I saw a video.
<SpeedyBolt> omg

<tSparx> My dad's attitude was, "If you're old enough to want to watch/read/hear it, you're old enough to watch/read/hear it."
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: No, just curious.:D
<cachi01|phone> Xd
<Ninjazz> I'm sure they've done their fair share.
<Petrified_Discord> STAH DAIING
<CCCP> SB64 i expected you would do better
<Reikim> Therefore you are chatsassin.
<cowvarkian> yeah, pretty much same here, tSparx
<CCCP> jk

<tSparx> Bye Daygon :)
<Silver_Spoon> for me
<AJIsAwesome> Daygon: Bye!
<Kurra> Honestly? I would only play this with the freaking original NES controller. A Wiimote would just be so much to worry over.
<tSparx> Kandarihu: Hard =/= fun, imo

<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi tigher1001
<HS> You can hit em with fireballs when you have that upgrade
*Ninjazz is plotting a route in chat.
<Kandarihu> Well, there's challenging hard and frustrating fun. Challenging is fun, frustrating is not

<Silver_Spoon> tigher1001: it calls Luigi to do the heavy lifting
<cowvarkian> Lonko: fuck that
<HoodyNinja> cowvarkian: Hes not a smart snake
<cow334> you still are
<tSparx> tigher1001: You mean the pirhanna plans, or the flying turtles?
<cachi01|phone> Yay
<Lonko> cowvarkian: It is the Jew-edition
<Ninjazz> Need to pick that up sometime.
<Reikim> I remember something about otakon stealing Val's trident. And some weird shipping with daribot.
<LadyCanary> Yay!

<Canadian_Brony> CCCP that is suicide
<cowvarkian> CCCP: only he plays every player?
<tSparx> Idk what that is, I haven't played any mario's :P
<Reikim> We still haven't figured out what an attraction to robots would be called.
<Kandarihu> Lonko, dat stereotype
<cachi01|phone> Biggysweet are u kidding me......
<CCCP> Canadian_Brony i know thats why its funny
<Reikim> Mechanosexual?

<Reikim> Exactly what I was going to say.
<Lonko> Bank 'em like a Jew
<kirz|GW2> fleshlight+ ?
<Kurra> Hack Mario's file to be a 3D pony/
<Reikim> ...
<tSparx> CCCP: I wanna watch MLP:FiM, G4*
<Kurra> Like they did in SM64.
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx never. EVER. Request ponies.
<cowvarkian> my little programmer
<HoodyNinja> 1 coin
<Reikim> I'm still ashamed that I even get that joke.
<CCCP> tSparx it doesnt work like that
<shibaru> Cookies
<Silver_Spoon> Kurra: make you small, and nimble, but you still die when hit
<Icydragon3d> 13WELL Can you talk shibaru?
<kirz|GW2> lol
<cachi01|phone> Kurra there might be a hack for that
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Ninjazz> Not that the rest of the robot mattered any way.
<tSparx> I wasn't requesting anything, I was suggesting that I might leave the stream to do it myself >_>
<kirz|GW2> everyone else did too, they just won't own up to it
<Canadian_Brony> SB there isn't
<Rex_Mundi> goodnight everypony. Stay pony my friends.
<shibaru> Maybe 8)

<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Night!
<HoodyNinja> this lel is easy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> has anyone played NSMB2 on 3ds? if so,is it good?
<tigher1001> tSparx: kinda want them to stream gen 1 and see how much people leave
<tSparx> I am not a monstrous fan of Mario, but I am a monstrous fan of G4 <3
<Silver_Spoon> Why do we not ask for ponies? Do we get G3 or something instead?
<Cynder7> 6Can you do group calls?
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<tSparx> tigher1001: Don't tempt the gods
<tSparx> Silver_Spoon: Invariably
<JESmith71> Kurra: Like the one that changes the textures to NES ones
<DashWithRainbows> First thing I see when I look at this chat was "Fleshlight."
<HoodyNinja> Silver_Spoon: When Caramel is streaming
<Icydragon3d> 13I CAN

<Reikim> Yeah
<tSparx> SB64 I think so too :P
*Kurra golf clap?
<Ninjazz> Wondering what took the most awkward award of all times.
<tSparx> Seaponies are good, the rest isn't :P
<Reikim> Oh my god
<Lonko> Mario is probably on drugs right now. Chasing those Coins is the equivalent of chasing the purple dragon!
<CCCP> :D
<tSparx> cowvarkian: Me too, but if I stay up too late it'll suddenly be 06:30 (GMT-5) xD
<Lonko> "MUST GET ALL THE COINS!"
<Silver_Spoon> Rainbow of Darkness...wat?

<Cynder7> 6BEHOLD
<Kurra> Man, you youngins have it SO easy these days.
<Klumzeedragon> Lonko: I know I am. :P
<Reikim> I'm torn between being ashamed for having taken part in it, and laughing my ass off at it.
<Lonko> Mario, it is impossible to get all those coins! - NOOOO
<tigher1001> Silver_Spoon: SOOP BE DO SHOOP SHOOPBE DO
*tSparx knows that so many people in the world have never done drugs >_> :D
<HoodyNinja> bad idea

<HoodyNinja> tSparx: I havent?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14why not both?
<Canadian_Brony> Fire Flower
<Biggysweet> you would think mario would get tired of this shit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i hope sea ponies make a debut in season 3,if they hint at a crystal empire which may mean a form of crystal pony then im hopin for some sea ponies :D
<Kurra> Back in my day, you had no analog control and all the enemies moved way faster and the scrolling screens would pin you dead in 5 seconds and....
<Reikim> Probably.
<prince-dari> Wassat
<cowvarkian> tSparx: is that east coast?
<Ninjazz> Ashamed about laughing about it.
<CCCP> I feel bad for mario
<Cynder7> 6I KILLED MY CLAN AND I LIKED IT
<Reikim> It involved shipping Bronystate with 4chan and discussing the anatomy involved therein.
<cowvarkian> or just a different country >.>
<tSparx> HoodyNinja: I mean so many people have ridiculous ideas about what weed does, compared to like acid etc.
<Lonko> Kurra: Back in my days, every game had a water level
<Silver_Spoon> Kurra: back in mooma's day? quarters...
<tSparx> cowvarkian: It's Midwest USA
<cowvarkian> ah, ok
<Dovah> and I am back. What's happening?
<Silver_Spoon> *momma's
<Icydragon3d> 13Lol gay
<tSparx> cowvarkian: St. Louis specifically
<Reikim> Shizu looked into chat and just walked right back out.
<HoodyNinja> Dovah: Nopony knows
<cachi01|phone> Back in my days......... Wait im 14.
<tSparx> Dovah: SB64's playing Mario
<Cades> hey
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra Back in my day, you had a Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device, or FLUDD, to do awesome stuff wih
<tSparx> cachi01|phone: Hahaha
<Dovah> cool
<Ninjazz> I can only imagine the watthefawk-ery.
<Reikim> It was pretty bad.
<Biggysweet> back in my day we playe with mud and sticks
<CCCP> :D
<tigher1001> I GUESS YOU CAN SAY HE FOUGHT FIR *puts on sunglasses* WITH FIRE YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<tigher1001> fire
<Ninjazz> I mean... all the CP.
<Petrified_Discord> No fireworks for you :(
<Ninjazz> >_
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Ninjazz> <_<
<Kurra> o3o;
<tSparx> Back in my day they had already made Spyro the Dragon :P
<CCCP> if you get 99 lives in this game mario plays with out a hat
<HoodyNinja> tigher1001: Fire lost
<cachi01|phone> FIRFIRFIRFIRFIRFIR
<HoodyNinja> Firpile
<LadyCanary> Good luck!
<Reikim> To be fair, it was also really late and we were all probably all half-crazy.
<Biggysweet> mario has terrible hat hair
<Reikim> Also, it was all my fault, and I'm completely ashamed of it.
<Icydragon3d> 13Sup nigs, how it is?
<Petrified_Discord> Alright, thumbs up? Let's do this.
<tigher1001> dat pink fat ass (srry for language
<Cades> meh, you?
<Lonko> Everybody chill out! He got this!
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony, we were proud that we had to blow on the cartridge to make it work! *shakes cane at*
<Reikim> Although I am, as previously stated, also laughing my ass off at the memory.
<Ninjazz> That was awkward and you should feel awkward.
*Petrified_Discord claps
<HoodyNinja> Like a baws
<Polydunami> When I was born, it was already a bit before the SNES era; and I didn't even about it until I was maybe four or five :P
<Cynder7> 6Anyway,videocall is about the most I can do..I have to stay soundless -.-
<Cynder7> 6Wb
<Polydunami> And that was about 1994/95 :$
<Lonko> Gotta love Jewrio
<Biggysweet> is that weegee
<HoodyNinja> all the vertical towers
<tSparx> Kurra: Oh no that's not true, we were still in Famicon when I was a *little* kid, but the first console we owned in middle school was a playstation
<Cades> lol im trying to take the tiles out, and i put a hole through the drywall :P
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> back in my day we didnt need no DLC! lol im lookin at YOU Capcom :|
<Reikim> I still blame Meanwhile for escalating it, though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is really more entertaining
<cachi01|phone> I love my nes and my snes
<Ninjazz> It would have been an interesting line of topic, atleast.
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra and I had to manualy jump-start my disc. THAT is harder than blowing on a cartridge
<Meanwhile> I blame you.
<cachi01|phone> Even though i have like 5 games for each
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hardly can tab out of Bronystate
<Meanwhile> I don't know what we're talking about.
<Ninjazz> Oh it's Meanwhile.
<Kurra> it's sad that cool games like SMB3 and the original Zelda.... people today miss out on. They really are still fun, if sorta meh on graphics, but they were such great challenges.
<tSparx> My prime video game years were N64
<Lonko> That thing is so retarded
<Meanwhile> But I blame you.
<CCCP> i got a NES but its a pain to set up
<cachi01|phone> I also love mah N64 :)
<tigher1001> my mom just gave me my sonic game durring a mario stream THE WORLD IS GOING TO END
<Ninjazz> Let's play the blame game.
<Reikim> Remember that time we discussed the various anatomies of shipping Bronystate IRC with 4chan?
<wirisme> I'm playin n64 right now
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony ....okay XD
<tSparx> The increase in graphics is a good thing, but our dependency on it isn't :/;
*HoodyNinja lost his SNES
<tSparx> :/*
<Reikim> Same night Saxy told us all about his...adult panel at the convention.

<Kurra> P.S. paintball is still best of the FPSes, the graphics never glitch and the feedback is INCREDIBLE
<tigher1001> cachi01|phone: ummmm /]
<Polydunami> I remember a commercial praising the amazing graphics of The Legend of Zelda for the NES :3
<Cades> grey man
<Kurra> Or, airsoft and paintball.

<cachi01|phone> wirisme (\
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 you missed every single coin . . .
<Canadian_Brony> shame
<Lonko> Those are no ordinary Mushrooms
<Lonko> They are MAGICAL
<Reikim> This one was also my fault, because I was stupid enough to mention Homestuck.
<Kurra> When I get paid, I'm gonna restore my paintball gun and go play some games. :3
<tSparx> Ouch
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol

<Meanwhile> kirz was on the panel?
<Reikim> kirz was probably distracted.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Kurra: Wow
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: yes.:D
<Meanwhile> You got some 'splainin to do.
<tSparx> Oh, yeah, I believe they were Gameboy Colour games

<Petrified_Discord> Sorry Toad, but my princess is in another castle.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahahahahhaha
<HoodyNinja> My ocd forced me to get every level perfect when i played this game :S
<Canadian_Brony> the first LoZ game I played was Ocarina of Time. I never got into Zelda until the OoT 3D was announced
<tSparx> My mistake, games blurring together xD
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: It's okay:)
<Kurra> My first Zelda game was... uh... the first Zelda game, but I didn't play it till like 2002 I think.... and I still haven't beat it

<tSparx> LunarSS: I loved every Zelda game (except those evil PC ones, but I never played them)
<Bronysith> oh hey the liar is in chat
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, and Link to the Past.
<Polydunami> Also, LunarSS, Wind Waker is a fun game; don't let people convince you otherwise :|
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: which one
<tSparx> Polydunami: I'm old enough to feel old, but not old enough to drink
<Meanwhile> God how weird would it be if it turned out someone in chat was /actually/ on that panel.
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: gamerluna
<tSparx> I actually never played Link to the Past
<Reikim> Saxy was.
<Kurra> I think they just come from the tenis court, people dropping them from the top of the Burj-Al Arab hotel o.o
<Reikim> Or he was there, at least.
<AJIsAwesome> LunarSS: Wind Waker is a FANTASTIC game.
<cowvarkian> oh, are we doing this again, Bronysith
<HoodyNinja> tSparx: 19?
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<CCCP> Bronysith Richard Nixion is not on this chat
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: Indeed
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was in the audience, I do NOT have the courage to go on there
<tSparx> HoodyNinja: 20. *shrug*
<CCCP> night Bronysith
<LunarSS> Okay, guess I'll have to play it
<Ninjazz> Random Hello, everyone.

<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: Hello!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14o_o
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Night!:)
<Reikim> You would, Saxy.
<Canadian_Brony> for Zelda games, I have OoT 3DS, OoT downloaded for the Wii, the first and second games from the 3DS Ambassador program, and Skyaward Sword
<Reikim> You would if NASA girl were there.
<tSparx> HoodyNinja: 1992 :)
<cachi01|phone> Ok i have Zelda 1 and 2 both are gold cartridges, twilight princess, OoT, Skyward sword and thats it..... The other ones i have them in my emulator
<Meanwhile> That's less reason to do it...
<tigher1001> ok someone has to stream slender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone own the CDi Zelda games?:D
<tSparx> The 3DS games I've never even played. I have the Majora's Mask gold cartidge still
<LunarSS> link to the past is probably my favourite
<Meanwhile> I'm sure there exists a girl somewhere who'd find that...impressive. But I doubt NASA girl is it.
<Polydunami> Should've been here last night, tigher1001 :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if it probably didn't break chat rules, I'd tell you just what that panel consisted of
<Reikim> Alright, point taken.
<cachi01|phone> OH i also own OoT 3D and 4 swords adventure anniversary
<HoodyNinja> use the pow block to get coins during the windstorm
<tigher1001> Polydunami: darn
<Reikim> We have imaginations, Saxy.
<Kurra> Okay okay so....
<DerpyMuffins> Has anyone read Foal in the basket?
<tSparx> Majora's Mask will always be my fav
<Canadian_Brony> I grew up with Mario, with which I have too many games to count
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fair enough
<Kurra> Let's REALLY go back in time.... who here ever flew model rockets? :D
<Bronysith> tSparx: same
<CCCP> :(
<shibaru> Is the grey man a troll?
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: Me.
<Canadian_Brony> I wouldn't know if I went off and looked for them
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> DerpyMuffins im on CH 4 so far
<Cades> he is THE troll
<Polydunami> I'm old enough to remember pogs
<HoodyNinja> eeeenope
<tSparx> Even though that was relatively late into my childhood (I guess I would've been in 6th grade)
<DerpyMuffins> Chapter 2 right now
*Kurra assembled an Alpha III and made a generic rocket from a parts pack :D
<tigher1001> nice savr
<Canadian_Brony> nice!
<HoodyNinja> gotta do it during a windstorm
<AJIsAwesome> Who remembers Sock Em' Boppers?
<HatsuneMikuFan> AJIsAwesome: I do!

*Kurra made out of sight flights on a C engine once oh XD it took forever to find the rocket again

<Polydunami> Indeed, I remember those, AJIsAwesome
<tigher1001> :megusta:
<AJIsAwesome> Did anyone here get the Power Glove?:D
<HoodyNinja> I had oldschool toys when i was young
<LadyCanary> Yay!
<Reikim> Although I have to confess I've never been on a panel like that.
<HoodyNinja> My family is poor
<tSparx> We should do Kerbals sometimes this week
<Kurra> I played the Virtual Boy once in a store! :D :D
<FillyFlam> AJIsAwesome: I do. I remember wanting them for Christmas but I couldn't get them because my parents said someone would die or something.
<Reikim> The last convention I went to was really bad.
<tSparx> FillyFlam: >?
<cachi01|phone> Brb DINNER!

<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 go back to the previous level and find the secret
<cow334> go right
<Cades> no
<tigher1001> :troll: right
<Reikim> And the equally-obligatory "ship everything with everything else" panel.
<Kandarihu> Ooh. The cannon looks inviting.
<FillyFlam> tSparx: I know, it never made much sense to me either. I mean, they were like filled with air.
<Cades> you are THE shibaru
<tSparx> Alright, I said I'd leave the last time the stream stopped, and I'm still back when he was fighting the sand-bowser
<Kurra> Nah, actually the Virtual Boy was really great 3D, just it was only 1 bit vectors. The mask of it was heavy too. And only red colors.
<tigher1001> la
<CCCP> i love this music :$
<tigher1001> do do doo LA
<Kurra> Or 2 bit monochrome red.
<HoodyNinja> theres only two secret levels in this game :(
<tSparx> So g'night everypony, see you tomorrow (or later tonight if I can't sleep :P)
<Kurra> ninight tSparx
<FillyFlam> Tata tSparx
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Night!

<PillowPoni|Lurking> cowvarkian made correct guess. But yeah they got a ban for that.
<cachi01|phone> Octobwer Marwch Septwember
<Petrified_Discord> xisbestchemical: What client are you using?
<Meanwhile> I like the personal story mechanic. The fact that it's even a little different depending on choices really makes it more fun.
<Brad__> I mean, its easy enough to watch it for free.... but gotta support the creators and all.....
<twilight_sprinkle> God: finally, and nobody believed me, but now i have proof that God said its octowber!
<Mutterguy> when they were chanting Kirby Kirby... I thoght they said Derpy
<NotIshBestPony> wait, who got banned?
<Petrified_Discord> I say we replace the month of May with something more assertive, like "Will".
<PillowPoni|Lurking> xisbestchemical: nice name. PPG reference?
<God> idk
<xisbestchemical> Petrified_Discord: The default Brony-State irc.
<cowvarkian> ikr

<PillowPoni|Lurking> NotIshBestPony; someone got banned this morning for posting S3 stuffs.
<Shizuka> 13if only i were not so conservative with power...
<twilight_sprinkle> NotIshBestPony: apparently joking counts as RP as well
<Petrified_Discord> SuperBrony64: lol your chat message appeared before you died on stream XD
<cowvarkian> and having an hour ban, but it somehow lasting for a day....
