<flutterlove123> PINK
<Biltzwing> WUT
<Ghosties> 04It was a very blatant moral lesson
<Boulderdash> solution - slave labor
<J_E_Smith71> Yep so 80s/90s. Them messages
<FriendshipIsRarity> That half green half blue guys looks like someone from sonic underground.
<Appropinquabamus> IF YOU USED THEM AS SLAVE
<DocSane> I'm an environmentalist and I HATE this shit.

<RosePetal1> No, he's alive I saw him.
<sonicdude558> ikr CrimsonPhoenix

<TehWaffle> YOU CAN COUNT ON MEEE!
*Dark92Enigma The animation is superb, the soundtrack is awesome, but the story is very weak. It's just recycled plot lines from the TV series, and a half-assed moral. This was probably the final word on The Jetsons and they STILL didn't give Judy much development. Jetsons: The Movie could have been better. It's not GOOD, but it's not terrible. It's a proper send-off for the Jetsons, IMO 5.4/10

<FriendshipIsRarity> Yup AJ.
<Lunar_Brony> Darf14 200% speed, that is. Not an increase by 200%
<Tovler|Drunk> CriticKitten: Kids these days need to build character and Southland tales. IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER. Bronies will comfortably demand this movie be WMC'd not. WMC'd in a Fandoy-Abandon Sort of way like they're doing now.
<RawketLawnchair> Spike, what are you doing.
<glowing_pc> PONIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<twilight_sprinkle> ah the episode that almost stopped me from becoming a brony
<Appropinquabamus> It's been a while since I've watched this one, actually
<otakon> Why does a pony need a girdle?
<Shizuka> 13big mac in a filly girdle?
<TehWaffle> Chipmunk ponies!
<XylemTube> Ticket Master?
<Shizuka> 13yes please
<Kinixys> Cross dressin' ponies.
<CriticKitten> otakon: I'm as surprised as you. But it's not WMC'd. Which means I could vote for it, if ponies really want to see a WMC movie....
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal1: and not to mention, the movie got voices like Mel Blanc and Tiffany, who was a top star at the moment, so one of the redeeming qualities was the voice talent
<CubanAmericanBrony> I spy PONIES!
<Darf14> dang
<Sumica> 00,10so fast forward all 52 eps of ponies?
<SunStone> The animation has gotten sooooo much better

<durger> just eat some of that grass over there geez Twilight
<TOY_PON3> Lord*

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Pretty good? Oh come on, AJ obvisouloy has the more helpful and beneful reasons xD

<Prince_Blueblood> blueblood is not amused by your puny insults
<sonicdude558> aww Flottahshy
<VenHur> Prince Moneybaggin' McCheapsakes.
<Gustavo> Angel is more of a douche than blueblood
<RAWRity> and Rainbow's isn't?
<Prince_Blueblood> blueblood can evolve into a rather nasty monster
<Apples> Awww!

<Prince_Blueblood> no, seriously, I've done it before lol
<otakon> YOU COULD JUST ASK TWI TO GET YOU IN!
<XylemTube> And so Fluttshy now plans to seank into a privae garden
<Headcrab2000> Oh my!
<OJ> Will the corpse flower be in bloom?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oz reference
<Tovler|Drunk> XylemTube: Well, the episode was still ok. But when you think about the predictable moral… /me hugs XylemTube.

<CrimsonPhoenix> can anyone guess where did that oatmeal line come from?
<L_Y_R_A> FOOD
<Tovler|Drunk> Ghosties: there are more vultures there than you think
<Trendy> eat a flower
<XylemTube> Pick RD
<Srake> There are buzzards in Wisconsin...
<CrimsonPhoenix> or is based on anyway
<RAWRity> Ghosties: NC is weird like that. We get Seagulls in the mountains
<FriendshipIsRarity> Really good?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJ and RD have best reasons
<Gustavo> pudgy face
<Headcrab2000> Pick spike!
<Eli> Ghosties: buzzards surprising? aren't they common as hell?
<otakon> Tovler|Drunk: no it was a momma bird when I was trying to save the baby
<TehWaffle> lol
<BlazeAngel> DECIDE

<Ghosties> 04I'd like to visit the mountains at some point
<Appropinquabamus> Darn you real life! Why must you pull me away from ponies?
<RAWRity> Ghosties: kernersville myself. it sucks.
<RDash5000> jbh1145: emerald!
<FriendshipIsRarity> Hayfries?
<otakon> Tovler|Drunk: it does since it really HAPPENED
<Kurra> otakon, perfect for the grazer in your life!

<sonicdude558> eeenope

<otakon> and then GODBOW DASH
<Gustavo> ze rain
<Time> Yellow magic?
<jbh1145> <RDash5000> isnt it obvious
<FriendshipIsRarity> Rainbow dash,you're a bitch.
<rocknrollpony> Lol, playing portal 2
<otakon> Hello God
<Tovler|Drunk> Ghosties: You've never seen wild turkies here? they happen
<Headcrab2000> derp
<RAWRity> no, I live in the country. I've just spent times in the mountains and seen seagulls
<otakon> OH DON'T GROVEL!
<XylemTube> RD IS BEST PONY
<AJIsAwesome|AFKish> Honestly, though. I doubt this was Trollestis. Celestia's only known the other Mane 4 during the end of the S1 premiere, and she's known Spike and Twilight practically their whole lives.
<Gustavo> IN MY OPINION, Rainbow Dash is a jerk.
<FriendshipIsRarity> So loyal.
<Ghosties> 04Tovler isn't NC either, is he?
<J_E_Smith71> Ghosties: Kernservile isn't the mountains
<fleskywood> THERE WAS NO RAIN SCHEDULED

<Jigglysaint> you know I think RD got LESS girly as the series went on
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|AFKish: eeyup good point

<Kurra> The clouds are 30 feet up. I love Ponyville. |3
<Pinkie_Kittie> Busted.
<L_Y_R_A> CLOSE IT
<Headcrab2000> Lol
<Eli> after that, many pony episodes will be streamed right?
<RAWRity> Ghosties: there's a number of folks in NC actually
<TehWaffle> Yea, okay.
<Darf14> yeah RD is a jerk, but thats why I like this character :)\
<Lunar_Brony> Ghosties that's, like, east coast, right?
<Tovler|Drunk> Ghosties: Turkies, Coyoties, and Snakes

<XylemTube> Dat community Sparkle
<LunasGuard> my fav phase
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome|AFKish, indeed. Hmm, maybe the two tickets were really meant for Twilight Sparkle and Spike. And it only became a conflict when Spike said that he didn't want to go.
<otakon> and she was gored
<Gustavo> SUDDENLY DRY

<TehWaffle> Who paints floors?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I'd like to think that Angel is generally a cute and pleasant pet except for some personality quirks as seen about half of the time he gets any screen time at all.
<jbh1145> AWWWWWWWWWW
<twilight_sprinkle> its not exactly the theme
<fleskywood> BENNY FUCKING HILL
<Biltzwing> Baby spike

<OmgItsVinylScratch> I'LL DO YOUR TAXES
<cachi01> derp
<jbh1145> No one relises shes a unicorn
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i think the idea is just that hes like her guardian
<Gumri> which one is that?
<Darf14> lol
<sonicdude558> and suddenly night
<Kinixys> People just have to watch the show enough to find something that hooks them. Trick is getting people to do that. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gustavo, wrong
<pony_125418> SEASON 3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

<Excadrill> Gustavo: She teleported in the second episode IIRC
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gustavo, Episode 2 against Nightmare Moon
<evilzebra> Fluttershy's wing was blue
<cachi01> THERE'S NO ESCAPE TWILIGHT
<Trendy> force field
<Darf14> wait.......did Fluttershy had a blue feather just a while ago?
<sonicdude558> Whats the next episode
<Appropinquabamus> THIS IS WHY AJ WINS
<Biltzwing> Rainbow dash wins
<Kencolt> Canonically, Twilight is the only Unicorn who is shown to teleport-- and she's still new to it at this point. Thus, Crispy Spike.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Darf14: yup
<Mozdoc> And in your state of mental turmoil Twilight, Celestia is laughing at your misery!
<Headcrab2000> trolololol
<Gumri> slightly darker coat?
<Headcrab2000> Give the ticket to spike
<J_E_Smith71> sonicdude558: The Top 10 list is a mystery
<TehWaffle> jbh1145: No one really knows the tele spell, that's why.
<Appropinquabamus> Rainbow Dash time
<cachi01> ok twilight now stfu and give the ticket to twilight
