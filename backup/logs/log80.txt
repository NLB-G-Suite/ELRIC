<Psyentific> I'll take em anyway
<MrMooMoo> I need a name for the TF2 gernade launcher.
<^Stargazer> Stargazer could make... a good starship name I guess...
<Ascendant> Just a discussion about emoticons
<Aurora> 6lol
<NightSeas> 12^
<Ascendant> Also Aurora, you want logs of the meeting?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Salad Sandwich and Sketchy Sounds. =p
<Psyentific> They're not starships actually
<nickstr> and their true meaning
<Psyentific> That'll work
<Aurora> 6suuuuuure why not
<Ascendant> There's no true meaning
<nickstr> not what these people say they mean
<Ascendant> sec
<Ascendant> http://pastebay.com/134855
<Psyentific> They're actual victorian cruisers
<Psyentific> Steamships
<Locke> Emphimere Aweryn, Dyrene Xith, Quillant De Rawst
<Sketchy_Sounds> "This is the good ship Salad Sandwich!"
<Ascendant> It's quite long
<drf|laptop> 03that's what she said
<Locke> I was thinking of the Mist powered Ships in FF12
<Xiagu> Psyentific, Cerulean ...something!
<NightSeas> 12I don't care what there true meaning is. That would be like saying that if I do something IRL, it has a "true meaning"
<Xiagu> ...Cerulean Glare?
<Psyentific> That'll work
<Locke> I made weird names for characters.
<Chimera> 04Roaraaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Sketchy_Sounds> This netbook screen is tiny
<Locke> THe thing I was doing was that Every main character would have an A in their last name.
<Ascendant> True meaning is a matter of perspective
<Sketch> I think it's kinda tough not to; no one wants to name their character Bobby
<Psyentific> Ooo! Locke, you got me two more ideas
<Ascendant> Everything is
<NightSeas> 12^
<Psyentific> Demosthenes and Locke
<Ascendant> Opinions depend on your philosophies
<Psyentific> ./Speaker for the Dead reference
<Locke> Varsanant, Thair, Rawst, Kisaragi, Aweryn
<junh1024-XD> "Everything's relative" - einstein
<Ascendant> And what you believe in depends on your opinions :p
<BlacklightShining> …lolwut?
<Dermathil> he's at Bronyshow
<Plorf> Why not just say Ender's Game?
<NightSeas> 12So try to stop acting like drf with that face thing
<Ascendant> and your philosophies are based off what you believe in
<BlacklightShining> hello DJ
<Plorf> It was in there too
<Locke> I forgot to put an A in Dyrene's last name though.
<Psyentific> Oh right derp
<Ascendant> haha junh1024-XD
<junh1024-XD> "true meaning" do you mean, the meaning that most people have ?
<BlacklightShining> Dyrane?

<Sketchy_Sounds> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3

<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Sketchy_Sounds
<junh1024-XD> and meanings are in people, not words
<nickstr> what is accepted by 99% of net users
<Locke> Dyrene is her first name.
<Ascendant> Well, how do you know what people think?
<BlacklightShining> …oh
<Locke> Xith was her last name
<Ascendant> You don't know their exact thoughts
<BlacklightShining> Xath?
<BlacklightShining> Axith?
<Locke> Meh
<Locke> Axith works actualy
<BlacklightShining> Xitha?
<BlacklightShining> ^.^
<junh1024-XD> then we can get into a long discussion about samplespaces & biases when sampling, stratas, etc
<Ascendant> I dunno, it's up to you, nickstr
<NightSeas> 12Also, I've been to other places online, and most of the people use that face the same way
<prince-dari> I might stream some Doctor Who.
<prince-dari> Or just requests.

<Psyentific> I'm getting ship names for Victoria 2
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'd play a bit if it wasn't so late and I wasn't in bed

<Sketchy_Sounds> Dangit I broke her again
<Leonon> Derpy is great at quantum physics
<Dermathil> >yfw the mannequins
<Dave_BroZilla> Pop-Unders
<Dave_BroZilla> they be a bitch
<SillyNilly> How so?
<prince-dari> This is open in VLC player, the episode is downloaded. :P
<Dave_BroZilla> DAT MANNEQUIN
<Dermathil> OH CRAP I BE RIGHT
<prince-dari> HOSHI-
<Dave_BroZilla> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Locke> I got the whole derpy and Chemistry thing from that one comic.
<Dermathil> >yfw ALL the mannequins
<prince-dari> Creak
<prince-dari> Creak
<Sketch> She understands nonlocality and uncertainty
<Dave_BroZilla> "Those mannequins need to be condemned." - Spike
<prince-dari> WUt
<prince-dari> RANDOM SPEAKINg
<prince-dari> WHAT THE HELL
<prince-dari> AAAHHH
<Locke> I decided to use that as Derpy's small bit of backstory for a story.
<prince-dari> WHY?
<SilverMane> i think you might have a bad file
<Dave_BroZilla> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Dermathil> prince-dari, did you close everything else?
<Dave_BroZilla> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> O__o
<prince-dari> Aww
<Dermathil> INCLUDING THE RADIO?
<SillyNilly> How is it that I've been with the fandom since April and I have only seen the show once? I feel pathetic.
<prince-dari> Prison left.
<GGgala> the mannequin JUDO CHOP
<Dave_BroZilla> Might be the episode itself you downloaded
<SilverMane> we'll always treasure the time we had with Prison
<Locke> She messed up her eyes using chemichles and her dad got so sick of looking at it he sent her to Amareica to study Chemistry.
<Sketchy_Sounds> YouTube is your friend
<prince-dari> So how come prison came here?
<Dave_BroZilla> AHH
<Dave_BroZilla> STREAM
<prince-dari> Wilson's dead.
<Dave_BroZilla> Y U CUT OUT ON ME
<prince-dari> I knew it.
<SilverMane> probably because we talked aboutit a lot last night
<SilverMane> i even got him to say Bronystate once or twice while he was reading my posts
<SillyNilly> So are the numerous other videos to distract me. I have so many friends.
<Polarfire> I'm kicking myself right now.
<prince-dari> DCD, Prison came on here. O_o
<NewDCD> 9great quality, dari
<Sketch> My sister actually had derpy's condition. Totally fixable with modern medicine
<Dermathil> ohai NewDCD again
<Dave_BroZilla> Sup NewDCD
<Dave_BroZilla> How's your singing career?
<prince-dari> We should get Prison to come and talk on here some time, I bet that'd get lots of viewers.
<Polarfire> and hey DCD
<Leonon> pics?
<SilverMane> lol I loved this doctor
<NewDCD> 9just that we gotta improve the audio a bit
<Sketch> Though I suppose there could be quite a few things that cause it
<NewDCD> 9what did Prison say?
<prince-dari> Yeah, no idea what to do about the audio.
<NewDCD> 9and why was he here so short I missed him?
<Locke> Trixie on the other hand. I made up the idea that Trixie was actually an Amareican imigrant (one of the very few) and she had knowledge in enginering vehichles and such
<SilverMane> just came by to check us out, talk, we told him thanks etc
<NewDCD> 9also RET'S PRAY A GAME http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36420613.html
<drf|laptop> 03Guys
<Glacymr> 12and i killed chat :D
<^Stargazer> eh
<drf|laptop> 03who agrees we need to force people to do this accurately in order to use TST chat
<drf|laptop> 03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/chatroulette-trolling-grammar-check.jpg
*drf|laptop hides
<Locke> Oh the powers of blank slates.
<nickstr> you did not
<SilverMane> and I said 'Oatmeal? Are you Crazy?'
<nickstr> but I must admit that sounds like dedication to me
<Dave_BroZilla> Can we use MS Paint to make sketches?
<nickstr> I did drift away for a while
<Glacymr> 12drf
<Foxm> whats the name of the pmv with the rap by MOP
<nickstr> those Team Rocket fillers got to me
<Ascendant> o-o
<Glacymr> 12they'll just type in all the options one after another
<espeon> Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Glacymr> 12until they get it right XD
<Locke> Most of the characters have no backstory. The ones that do only have a small amount that you can fill with pretty much anything you want.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03make it s oif they get it wrong it kicks them for 20 minutes
<drf|laptop> 03or something
<Locke> Thats part of what makes a MLP story alot easier when you need somepony to have a skill.
<Glacymr> 12then they come back 20 minutes later get it right by pure luck and are like "hey guys look over they're
<Dave_BroZilla> And there be your first request
<Glacymr> 12"
<Leonon> Derpy's canon backstory, she messed up the bird part of WInder Wrap Up and she has some interrest in fashion
<Sketch> Fanfiction paradise
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<prince-dari> BEEP
<prince-dari> BEEP
<prince-dari> BEEP
<Dave_BroZilla> Anyone asking a request of me is going to be sorely disappointed by my MS Paint skills
<prince-dari> BEEP
<Dave_BroZilla> TOOT
<Dave_BroZilla> TOO
<Dave_BroZilla> TOOT
<Xiagu> Nah but they show a purple Derpy clone in that episode :/
<Dave_BroZilla> TOOT
<Dave_BroZilla> oh, wait
<Sketchy_Sounds> (\^3^/)
<SilverMane> dammit BroZilla
<Locke> Thats not backstory.
<Dave_BroZilla> :B
<Glacymr> 12[22:15:34] <Glacymr> !pokemon
<Glacymr> 12[22:15:35] <Nightshadow|VNC> Glacymr, you are a Latias.
<Glacymr> 12:<
<Sketch> Show a lot of clones in a lot of multi pony scenes
<Sketchy_Sounds> Derpy's seen in Green Isn't Your Colour fairly clearly
<Dave_BroZilla> HERRO DOCTAH
<Locke> I know.
<Sketch> Running of the leaves is a good example
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Locke> Derpy is a pony of the highest tastes.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Running of the Leaves has a Dash clone of all things XD
<Dermathil> he isn'T as good as tennant tho
<prince-dari> No.
<Dermathil> HAHA
<Dave_BroZilla> YES
<prince-dari> Not as good, I still like him though.
<Leonon> Running of the Leaves has a dash clone for a split second
<Locke> In all honesty everypony does look the same.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Dave_BroZilla> Eccelston is still awesome
<prince-dari> And much prefer him to Smith.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Both times the herd of runners pass AJ or RD, there's a Dash clone
<Dermathil> He sounds good, but not Excellent.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Locke> The only thing that seperates anyone is Colour and hairstyle.
<Dermathil> Smith is crap compared to the others.
<Locke> Oh and breed.
<nickstr> I got sick and tired of week after week seeing episodes that looked almost identical in plot
<Dave_BroZilla> lul
<Dermathil> DAT ARM
<Foxm> and CM
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Locke> but body wise everypony looks the same.
<Dermathil> she can'T hear
<Leonon> there's male and female too, and the 6(?) nonstandard body types
<Sketchy_Sounds> Big Mac begs to differ
<Sketch> There are a few variation in head style and such, maybe even stature. But essentially
<Foxm> male ponys have square jaws
<prince-dari> 'armless
<Dave_BroZilla> LAWL
<Glacymr> 12and here i thought you just got tired of no misty
<Leonon> oh, 7 nonstandard body types: Mac, Snipes, Snails, Mr Cake, Mrs Cake, Luna, and Celestia
<Locke> Yeah
<prince-dari> Doctor WHO?
<Locke> Granny smith
<killerrabbit> the bullies?
<nickstr> that was the last straw
<prince-dari> I love how they avoid the name drop.
<nickstr> after her departure EVERYTHING I liked was gone
<Locke> But for the most part ponies all have the same body structure.

<Glacymr> 12hi
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well yes, because they're all horses =p
<FreezeFrame> I like Smith. He's more innocent on the outside like pre-Time War doctors, but he's dark. Look at A Good Man Goes to War
<nickstr> she kept me hanging on in Johto and suffering through those HORRIFIC and monotonous Team Rocket fillers
<Locke> >->
<Shamrock> Back, sorry!
<Leonon> Hey, horses can look a lot different
<Sketch> Wb
<FreezeFrame> Also, Matt Smith Doc has Amy and Rory Pond.
<prince-dari> Meh, I don't think he can act.
<Locke> I have a friend from the housepets forum who goes by shamrock/challenger
<Dermathil> Yeah.
<prince-dari> River Song is the only character I watched for.
<Dermathil> Maybe I hate the flipping fez.
<ValtheJean> howdy gents
<Sketchy_Sounds> They can, but ultimately they're all built from the same basic blueprint so to speak
<prince-dari> With the latest series.
<FreezeFrame> fezzes are cool
<ValtheJean> awww, no more super robots? :(
<prince-dari> Hey Val.
<ValtheJean> howdy Dari
<Leonon> you humans all look alike too!
<Dermathil> VAL
<Dermathil> YOU'RE BAKC
<SilverMane> ValtheJean! well hello there
<ValtheJean> I am? I'll be damned! :P
<Locke> Please don't do that.
<ValtheJean> howdy SilverMane
<Sketch> I bet we do
<ValtheJean> and Dermathil
<Dave_BroZilla> Sup ValtheJean, what's crackalackin?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<ValtheJean> nothing much Dave, how about yourself?
<Dermathil> go to #p&D ValtheJean
<prince-dari> It'd be good if we had 20-50 people who just stayed he regularly to chat.
<prince-dari> here*
<Dermathil> yeah
<Xiagu> you need to have seen a reasonable amount of a species / ethnicity before you can start distinguishing between individuals well
<ValtheJean> we *almost* have about 20 regulard
<ValtheJean> regulars*
<prince-dari> People tend to just leave after movie nights though. :/
<Sketchy_Sounds> Indeed
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Locke> I have ten dollars
<prince-dari> We have quite a few regulars.
<^Stargazer> ...
<nickstr> I own the complete original series on DVD now and must admit this is true about much of Johto
<Leonon> Icecream?
*Dermathil waves
<Locke> Yep ten dollars is all the money I have to my name.
<nickstr> early Master Quest on the other hand
*FreezeFrame waves
<prince-dari> Ohai.
<prince-dari> :D
<ValtheJean> I've actually been pretty bad about that, there have been a few things that have come up and I've left some of the streams earlier >.<
<Polarfire> I'm aregular :D
<ValtheJean> but I'm doing better!
<Xiagu> d00d, you need to get 10 more, otherwise slendermane is gonna get you
<prince-dari> I haven't been here for about the last 3 movie nights.
<nickstr> YEAA!
<Dermathil> I waved to attract the attention that I am a major regular
<Locke> Meh
<Leonon> but sewing supples, make plush Fluttershy, sell for profit
<prince-dari> Damn you life.
<prince-dari> Y U SO BUSY?
<Locke> I'll summon Ifrit or something
<ValtheJean> haha, I know that feeling dari, I know that feel too well :P
<GGgala> I'm trying to be around more, but stuff keeps happening!
<Xiagu> take apart Easy button, reflash to say ``Yay'', sell on ebay for HUGE MONIES
<Polarfire> yeah : /
<Dave_BroZilla> It's goin pretty good
<Locke> I'm going to go to Study chat now
<Xiagu> ....and put ``insert into Fluttershy's hoof'' in there somewehre
<Dave_BroZilla> Doing a sketch for NewDCD's corrupt a request thread
<Polarfire> My stuff for school started up last week and has been stealing my time..
<^Stargazer> make a good anything you'll probably make a huge profit lol
<Leonon> I'm really surprised no one's used that idea yet
<^Stargazer> make good plushies and ebay them and you'll probably at least 5x the ammount of the materials you used to make them lol
<HyperMetalLugia> OoT?
<nickstr> I liked the early part of Master Quest so much that when it came time to hunt down Johto stuff that was the first one I looked for
<nickstr> no
<Dermathil> >mfw KENNEDY
<nickstr> Pokemon
<nickstr> the TV series?
<Xiagu> There's a time investment too, and time is money
<nickstr> the fifth season is known as Master Quest
<^Stargazer> do it on your spare time lol
<Xiagu> I think the skills of plushy-making and Easy button-hacking don't have that many people between them
<Sketch> Unless it's free time
<^Stargazer> ifrit...
<Locke> Ifrit
<DJMidli> Xiagu why are you hacking my companies product >:(
<prince-dari> Deaf
<^Stargazer> it's funny, Final Fantasy summoner is the basis I think I'm gonna go with for Stargazer's choice in magic styles
<Dermathil> death
<Dermathil> that's what he meant
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Sketch> For profit
<Glacymr> 12silly HyperMetalLugia :)
<^Stargazer> I've always loved summoners in the FF games
<Glacymr> 12has link on his mind
<GGgala> inb4 Deaf is a new companion

<Sketch> I assume :p
<Locke> Ifrit, Shiva, Valafore, Ixion the lighting pony
<prince-dari> FUND IT
<Loopelly> I'm back. What did I miss?
<nickstr> can't say I blame him
<DJMidli> Xiagu :P I work for staples/business depot
<^Stargazer> Carbuncle is the best!
<Locke> Ixian on FFX and Odin on FFXIII
<DJMidli> Xiagu and all the co-workers have thought of changing the buttons to say "She was easy"
<Locke> Both ponies
<DJMidli> Xiagu so don't feel bad
<GGgala> Deaf: The Silence's wacky cousin
*^Stargazer really is addicted to carby in FFXI... has scared many many people too lol.
<Dermathil> NO MICKEY NO
<DJMidli> carby is awesome in ffxi
<Xiagu> because Easy buttons are easy to mess with, or so I've heard?
<DJMidli> cute little blue squirrel
<Dave_BroZilla> Silvermane, I fulfilled your request

<Dave_BroZilla> "Durr, I'm too cool to cry out for help."
<Dermathil> NOOOOOO
<Aurora> 6LOL
<DJMidli> Xiagu from what my friend said it was impossible to crack it open without breaking to much stuff.
<prince-dari> Shiny Mickey is best Mickey.
*Light_Latias sighs
<^Stargazer> heck, I call my tarutaru a carbuncle in disguise lol
<SilverMane> omfg BroZilla... that was horrifyingly hilarious crazysauce
<^Stargazer> >_>
<Locke> I use Carbuncle in dissidia.
<Dermathil> >mfw Mickey don't look same at all
<DJMidli> tarutaru.. a meal for a carbuncle
<Light_Latias> I cant focus on Link ;-;
<^Stargazer> >_>
<Dave_BroZilla> Why thank you :D
<ValtheJean> argghhhh I can't take it anymore, the urge is too strong
<ValtheJean> hey, hey! Hey Dari!
<ValtheJean> Psssst! Dari!

<^Stargazer> Carby's only a little bit bigger then taru's lol
<Dermathil> he's trying to get the beep
<Dave_BroZilla> HEY! DARI! LISTEN!
*ValtheJean dons troll mask
<Sketch> Oh carby-pulling, I remember you
<NewDCD> 9my comp froze
<NewDCD> 9I am back now
<ValtheJean> 11th doctor > 10th doctor
<^Stargazer> I'm a BLM main though, I'm actually decently well geared too
<Dave_BroZilla> NewDCD! I fulfilled a request!
<Polarfire> welcome back DCD :D
<Polarfire> ... again
<ValtheJean> ohai NewDCD
<^Stargazer> can't wait till I make some replacements though, Novio earring, that one int/mab ring...
<SilverMane> lawl wut
<Locke> My fursona is mainly a black mage. My Ponysona is a theif.
<GGgala> Mickey is a toon!
<FreezeFrame> 11 wears bow ties, and bow ties are cool.
<ValtheJean> umad dari? :D
<Locke> and the Exranio wich represents the real me is just a gamer.
<DJMidli> im a PLD main with rings that cost 2.5million
<Sketch> I played rdm though. Later war, which was way more fun
<prince-dari> Caramel is a fag.
<^Stargazer> BLM, RDM, WHM, THF, SMN... and to a lesser extent DRK which is still 78 lol
<prince-dari> Umad Val?
<DJMidli> and im a RNG when i want to do some dammage with a gun
<ValtheJean> totally worth it :P
<SilverSonic> D:
<DJMidli> and yes..a gun
<DJMidli> im a Gun/bullet ranger deal with it :3
<^Stargazer> my blm does 6k nukes, and hopefully I'll see a 9-11k nuke eventually
<Dave_BroZilla> oh, the lulz
<Locke> Random note
<Leonon> THis Ipad case made me nostalgia http://rsk.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pRS1-9583856w345.jpg
<Dermathil> CARAMEL IS A TOMATOE
<Sketch> Nothing quite like a mithra with a great axe
<Dermathil> *Tomato
<GGgala> caramel = cigarette
<Locke> Aperently they were thinking Sahz would actually be a better repsentative for FFXIII in dissidia than Lightning
<ValtheJean> ATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK OF THE KILLER CARAMELLLLLLLL
<^Stargazer> most mithra are perverted boys lol
<Dave_BroZilla> Dat TARDIS
<Locke> So that means if there is Dissidia three there will definitly be Sahz
<^Stargazer> Did Vivi ever get in the second Dissidia?
<Sketch> I'm sure they are, lol
<FreezeFrame> http://tytempletonart.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/ultimate-spider-man-bun-toons-yay/
<Locke> No sadly
<The_Crowing> Speaking of Final Fantasy. I had a weird idea. I actually thought of Final Fantasy tactics Classes for all the ponies
<^Stargazer> He's still my favorite FF character
<Locke> I liek Freye but thats proably the furry talking
<^Stargazer> I like Freye too, I always liked her personality
<Locke> god why can't I type
<^Stargazer> but Vivi is definitely my favorite character
<FreezeFrame> I think the Marvel fanbase needs to learn some love and tolerance.
<Dave_BroZilla> Spiderman is black
<Dave_BroZilla> wat
<Light_Latias> brb
<Light_Latias> err
<Light_Latias> bbl
<nickstr> consider yourself lucky even though you are focusing on Link
<Locke> It would be cool to have Quina
<nickstr> its easy to find related stuff if you want to collect things
<nickstr> for me its kind of difficult
<Locke> common you all know you want to play as Quina.
<FreezeFrame> Ultimate Spider-Man
<^Stargazer> Steiner and Garnet were my least liked in that game... Steiner got a heck of a lot better when he started liking Zidane
<FreezeFrame> They killed off Peter Parker
<The_Crowing> Dash=Dragoon, AJ=Knight, Twilight=Mathmatician, PinkiePie=Mime, Rarity=Mystic, Fluttershy=White Priest
<Locke> I'll admit Garnet isn't the most interesting
<Sketch> Really don't have a favorite ff character. Hmmm. Maybe red13
<Dave_BroZilla> wat
<Dave_BroZilla> I knew I liked DC better for a reason
<^Stargazer> FFXI jobs are pretty easy for most of the FiM cast
<Topshot> this is boring, let's switch over to breadchat
<Topshot> anyone bake anything nice lately
<Sketch> I suck at baking
<prince-dari> Hmm
<GGgala> they did? huh.
<prince-dari> What could that be?
<Sketch> I can cook. Pretty well actually
<Locke> I was thinking Fluttershy=Summoner
<GGgala> i'm like a year behind on actual comics things
<Dermathil> >idiotic
<Sketch> But baking, not so much
<^Stargazer> Twilight: Scholar, Trixie: Black Mage, Rarity: Dancer, Fluttershy: Beastmaster, Celestia: Paladin, Luna: Dark Knight, Pinkie Pie: Puppet Master
<prince-dari> Ohh.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Topshot> that's cool
<Locke> Rairy=White mage Twi=Black mage
<DJMidli> Topshot i cookled some awesome pasta
<^Stargazer> I'd say Fluttershy is BST over Summoner
<Dermathil> lol
<Dave_BroZilla> So sloooooow
<The_Crowing> nah Fluttershy would be the healer.
<Dermathil> I am starting to like that doctor.
<GGgala> this running music is the best
<Dave_BroZilla> Even I felt smarter than a British person right there
<^Stargazer> BST summons rabbits and what not to attack for them lol
<prince-dari> Did you see the gas mask child episode Dermathil?
<The_Crowing> Rarity has no magic other then gem finding
<Locke> Well summoners are also healers alot of the time
<Dermathil> Dave, you felt smarter than an ALIEN
<Dermathil> Gas mask child?
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Dermathil> Sounds familir
<^Stargazer> Dancer has a lot of fashionish with them, you see it in their AF sets
<The_Crowing> She would be a mystic because her whining would cause staus effects
<Sketch> I love pasta
<Dermathil> *Fa,o;oar
<DJMidli> RBD: thief/nin
<Dermathil> *Familiar
<prince-dari> Those two episodes are Eccelston's best in my opinion.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Dave_BroZilla> An Alien with a British accent
<prince-dari> So, you should enjoy them.
<^Stargazer> dash I'd go with thf too
<Dermathil> OH.
<^Stargazer> I was thinking AJ could be monk
<Dermathil> Eccleston.
<^Stargazer> kick attacks and all
<Locke> I was actually thinking of giving each poy 4 or so jobs
<KShrike> :D
<Dermathil> I never saw any eccleston episode
<DJMidli> definately
<KShrike> I am absolutely happy today!!!
<Dermathil> except his part in the Christmas special ep
<prince-dari> Ah.
<DJMidli> awesome!
<Sketch> Twi: blk/whm
<KShrike> Like, you have no idea
<Locke> Like Dash's options=Theif, Dragoon, Ninja, time mage.
<^Stargazer> Schollar fits Twilight better IMO
<DJMidli> btw KShrike have you ever played EvEonline?
<The_Crowing> Twi should be mathmatician
<KShrike> No
<KShrike> sorry
<DJMidli> k i knew someone with a name close to yours on eve ;)
<^Stargazer> scholar is basically BLM and WHM combined, and has a lot of school look, they also have books
<KShrike> I play DFO, and Starcraft II
<DJMidli> so do tell why you are so happy KShrike
<KShrike> Anyway, a friend of mine watched the first episode
<KShrike> this will take a while
<Locke> I know Dash obviosly dash can't do magic but I think it makes sense for the Fasr one to get time magic skills anyway.
<^Stargazer> anywho, I need to go to bed lol
<The_Crowing> Dragoon is her perfect class imo
<^Stargazer> night every pony
<^Stargazer> Spike btw = DRAgoon lol
<KShrike> He posts on my wall on Facebook, and says "Well, I figured your picture is a pony from My Little Pony, so I watched the pilot, but all I could do was shake my head and not become a fanatic."
<KShrike> Or something similar, anyway
<^Stargazer> I'd laugh to see spike summon a dragon lol
<Dave_BroZilla> Oh blob, it mad
<KShrike> So I get on Facebook Chat with him
<Dermathil> Silvermane, you ain't in Silvershipper no more
<KShrike> I tell him to watch episode 3 at least.
<Plorf> >facebook chat
<Locke> I just preper them having the option to switch between clasess. Like in FF3 but eachcharacter has four classes.
<The_Crowing> No, no make him watch Dragonshy
<KShrike> an hour later, he comes to me and says "Dude, episode 4 is better than episode 3". YEEEHAH!

<KShrike> Sorry, you guys may have friends in the real world that are bronies, but I haven't until just now :D
<KShrike> So you can understand my excitement
<Locke> Spike=Warrior, Knight, Paladin, Jester
<drf|laptop> 03was it some Windows Security 2012 thing?
<drf|laptop> 03that's what LL had
<Dave_BroZilla> Shit, am I the only one who hasn't heard of the extreme rioting in London going on right now?
<drf|laptop> 03I fixed it for her
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<BigMacintosh> >_> <_<
<PizzaPony> did he died?
<prince-dari> I haven't. :o
<BigMacintosh> pony time
<prince-dari> Riots about what?
<GGgala> i heard in chat earlier today
<ValtheJean> yeah, it's been pretty nasty
<Aurora> 6that stupid false antivirus with the 4-colored shield? that was it
<Sketch> I don't really
<Xiagu> KShrike, it is a wonderful thing!
<drf|laptop> 03yep]
<Locke> Twilight= WM,BLUM,BM,RM
<Dave_BroZilla> Apparently third day of riots, car bombs and all that
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<ValtheJean> hockey I believe, or some sort of sport right?
<GGgala> no details though. what's the deal?
<Dashite> Heard about it earlier yeah.
<BigMacintosh> I just downloaded some guy 4 gb pony folder
<drf|laptop> 03and you used Malwarebytes to fix it?
<BigMacintosh> so many pics.....
<Aurora> 6been causing issues for years, that's what ate my old laptop
<Aurora> 6yeh
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Dashite> Is this still to do about the cop that shot someone?
<drf|laptop> 03same here
<drf|laptop> 03and then I used that exefix_xp to fix it
<drf|laptop> 03it works on Windows 7 as well LOL
<Locke> Flutteryshy-WM, Summoner, Beast Master, Anamalist
<KShrike> They don't call it "big" macintosh for... yeah yeah. 4 Gigabyte pony folder?
<nickstr> because you can still run MS-DOS .com files
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure any more
<ValtheJean> I've heard too many rumors
<Aurora> 6wait thats xp
<drf|laptop> 03but for some reason there's no command.com anymore
<Aurora> 6is it XP/win7 only?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03opposed to what Aurora
<Aurora> 6or would it work on vista
<nickstr> its emulated
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03it should work on visa, yeah
<drf|laptop> 03*Vista
<drf|laptop> 03just try it LOL
<nickstr> but should work if you run that in administrator mode
<Aurora> 6ugh administrative priviledges
<The_Crowing> Anyway, getting off ff for a sec. Anyone else wonder why the ponies have pet animals that cant talk even though they can?
<drf|laptop> 03I just have one account only
<drf|laptop> 03automatic admin
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03though
<drf|laptop> 03one time was epic fail
<drf|laptop> 03I somehow managed to make myself not an admin
<Locke> No
<drf|laptop> 03and only had one acount
<Aurora> 6my mom's paranoid about this computer now, I don't think she'll enjoy me asking to run this lol >>
<drf|laptop> 03took me hours to fix it >_>
<Locke> Ferals and sentients. In the furry and cartoon world it's something you get use too.
<drf|laptop> 03DARN YOU FEATHER
<Sketch> Not really, heh
<Dave_BroZilla> BREAKDANCE, MANNEQUINS, BREAKDANCE
<drf|laptop> 03You need to try responding to me sometime
<KShrike> Equestria is a world where ponies are the dominant species
<KShrike> simple answer to a complex question
<Aurora> 6god I'm so tired right now
<Aurora> 6I'm gonna go
<Glacymr> 12bye
<Glacymr> 12:<
<KShrike> Well, at least, ponies are ONE of the dominant species
<The_Crowing> Still, its weird that in a world of talking animals there are animals that cant talk
<PizzaPony> does anyone else hear random music?
<KShrike> No... you don't understand
<KShrike> Humans are to Earth as Ponies are to Equestria
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr I see you playing TF2
<Dashite> Looks like these riots are continuations of the one that started over the shooting a couple days ago. Dunno if they are still about that though.
<Glacymr> 12no i'm not
<^RainbowDash> ^
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Locke> In Equestria anyway
<drf|laptop> 03steam says you are
<killerrabbit> ^^
<Sketch> Humans are talking animals
<Glacymr> 12i opened up tf2
<Glacymr> 12doesn't mean i'm playing it :P
<KShrike> Well, in a secular sense they are
<Locke> As far as we know Gryfon's have their own country
<drf|laptop> 03why would you open a game that you don't intend to play
<KShrike> Along with dragons
<Glacymr> 12i need to find the link to the tf2 video i uploaded onto youtube
<Locke> And Buffalo
<KShrike> And whatever other characters we see in the future
<Xiagu> sort of strange not to live in the country ruled by the two physical gods of the world
<HyperMetalLugia> Glacymr is terrible
<prince-dari> Lol, Mickey.
<HolyJunkie> Howdy.
<Locke> I still don't consider them gods.
<Glacymr> 12?
<HyperMetalLugia> He likes to waste RAM :<
<KShrike> Neither do I
<HolyJunkie> They move stuff in space.
<HolyJunkie> Comparitively, they are gods.
<killerrabbit> if they can control entire solar bodies, I would consider them gods
<Xiagu> How strong do you think they are then?
<Locke> If they were imortal gods they would not need gaurds
<Dave_BroZilla> lul
<KShrike> Just because "Oh Celestia" is a phrase, does not mean they are gods
<HolyJunkie> And they're also immortal.
<Retsamoreh> Lol
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/how-the-new-8216protecting-children-bill-puts-you-at-risk/590 < Epic fai
<HyperMetalLugia> l
<Xiagu> I meant it more as a figure of speech sort of thing for their power levels
<Dave_BroZilla> In all honesty, I'd be doing the same as him though if I just went through that
<Locke> Imortal to death by age.
<Glacymr> 12i want to get that tf2 achievement
<The_Crowing> The most powerful creatures in Equestia are the alicorns
<GGgala> gotta love mickey
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<HolyJunkie> The guards are more like a police service.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dermathil> same here
<Retsamoreh> To be a guard in a world of fantasy is to sign your death papers.
<Glacymr> 12where you get a youtube vid upto 100,000 views
<Xiagu> idk what you associate with the term gods, so we can just stop using it
<Plorf> LET'S TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS
<Plorf> http://www.cracked.com/article_19376_5-scientific-reasons-your-idea-happiness-wrong.html
<Sketch> Well, they may not -need- guards
<The_Crowing> Celestia and Luna are immortal.
<Locke> if they don't need gaurds then have thm do other stuffs.
<GGgala> yeah, to him he just got ate, kidnapped, and then suddenly rose and this guy
<Glacymr> 12so i uploaded some junk and put it on auto refresh
<Dave_BroZilla> BRB IN 10 SECONDS, WUV ROSE
<Locke> There are two types of Imortal
<The_Crowing> They each have lived for hundreds of years.
<HolyJunkie> They do have them do other stuff. They serve as police.
<Silvermane> lol wut
<Dermathil> >mfw THE EHAD
<HolyJunkie> Peacekeepers.
<Dermathil> *HEAD
<Retsamoreh> I mean
<Dave_BroZilla> PINEAPPLE EXPRESS
<Retsamoreh> Even in Equestria, being a guard sucks.
<Xiagu> I get the impression that Celestia puts up with a lot more fancy traditions than she likes
<Locke> One is you can't die. The other is you can live forever as long as nothing kills you.
<Dermathil> WHATSHISNAME THE ALIEN THAT KNOWS ALL
<Sketch> And Really, guards guard more than your physical safety
<Xiagu> in terms of being flown everywhere and all the proper things to do at the gala and whatnot
<Locke> I think Celestia and Luna fall under the second imortal.
<Dave_BroZilla> So...how about that Samurai CHamploo song I just heard?
<Sketch> Your peace, Your palace, Your holdings
<Silvermane> omfg what is happening
<Sketch> Things dear to you
<Dave_BroZilla> dat 75% slower
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Locke> I'm jsut saying. They made equestria. Not the world.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Silvermane> 5 billion. lawl wut
<Dave_BroZilla> fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive biliiiiiiiiiiiioooonnnnnn
<Dave_BroZilla> thiiiiiiis iiiiisss the daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
<Locke> Demi gods at best to me.
<Dave_BroZilla> the eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeearrrrttthhhhhhhhh
<Sketch> They delegate problems and annoyances
<prince-dari> wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurld
<Dave_BroZilla> blooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwsssssss uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppp
<killerrabbit> they can control the rotation of the planet at will
<Xiagu> Actually I don't think that canon has confirmed they made Equestria at all
<killerrabbit> that takes an insane amount of energy
<Xiagu> anyway I still don't think we're actually successfully arguing here >__>
<Dave_BroZilla> whoooooooooo the heeeeellllll aaaaaaaaarrrrrreeeeee yoooooooooooouuuuuu
<Dave_BroZilla> Iiiiiiiiiiiii'm the doctooooooooooorrrrrr
<prince-dari> This is trippy.
<The_Crowing> they move the sun and the moon. Thats nothing but powerful telekinesis
<Dave_BroZilla> AVATAR
<Plorf> ... oh, I guess we didn't talk about happiness
<Xiagu> People are using words different ways :X
<GGgala> iii'm triiipping baaaaallls
<prince-dari> FACE OF BO
<prince-dari> YANA
<Sketch> And live on the moon for 1000 years
<prince-dari> SPOILERS
<Dermathil> THE FACE OF BO
<Locke> I'm just saying I only think they are very powerful, and have extended lifespans.
<Dermathil> YANA
<Dermathil> YANA
<killerrabbit> The_Crowing: are you suggesting that in the MLP universe the sun universe revolves around the planet?
<Dermathil> YANA
<Xiagu> Sketch, she was imprisoned /in/ the moon, not /on/ it
<Dermathil> THE ONE AND ONLY
<GGgala> CASSANDRA
<Dave_BroZilla> THE LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST HUUUUUUUUMAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN
<killerrabbit> sun/universe
<Silvermane> god wtf i hated that bitch
<Sketch> Ah, fair enough, but still
<GGgala> 'moisturize me'
<Locke> For Luna it was more like being frozen in a block of ice for a long time then thawed out.
<Dave_BroZilla> Yeah, last human was a bitchy bitch
<prince-dari> Susan from My Family.
<The_Crowing> Yeah, Celestia makes the sun rise and set.
<Xiagu> I'm not convinced that Equestria is even on a planet
<NewDCD> 9Brozilla
<NewDCD> 9I'm scanning
<Locke> As I said there are Two types of Imortal.
<Retsamoreh> Equestria is actually a giant spaceship.
<Xiagu> since the sun actually rises and sets, and that doesn't really happen on a spherical planet
*Dave_BroZilla begins squeeing
<The_Crowing> so, shes in control of it and that means the planet is the center of the universe
<Retsamoreh> By giant, I mean planet-sized.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: wait, what? that happens on earth lol
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, not everywhere at the same time
<Xiagu> I mean like, I don't think Equestria has time zones or anything
<Sketch> Your spirit is encased magically in a sphere, but you are released according to prophecy, 1000 years later, become corporeal, etc
<Equestria> Stop talking about me.
<HolyJunkie> I'm pretty sure they turn the Earth.
<killerrabbit> who says it is everywhere at the same time? we only see it in ponyville
<Xiagu> It's always day somewhere on Earth, but I'm not sure that is the same case on Equestria
<Dave_BroZilla> http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLQTiCwPsUwmcM5r20dsdF-z6AAySkOKwrxCjoEWQZxJnkAkTXpg
<Sketch> Pretty darn immortal
<The_Crowing> Celestia and Luna control the sun and the moon and the pegasi control the wheather
<Locke> Equestria is the country.
<Dave_BroZilla> damn, broke. Trying again.
<Dave_BroZilla> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/124f8c456f14e9ba35030cf06689f2e8/14693%20-%20macro%20twilight_sparkle%20yes.jpg
<Equestria> Leave me out of this.
<Xiagu> Well, there's the Summer Sun Celebration right? And Celestia actually does some fancy thing at sunrise, complete with horn glowing and whatnot
<Silvermane> lol nice Dave
<Dave_BroZilla> I'm a natural
<Balloons> Since when did a country gain acsess to IRC?
<Dave_BroZilla> AND IT APPEARED IN THE STREAM I'M FAMOUS
<Xiagu> so... it's implied that sunrise is a discrete time
*Nuclear needs to expand his vocabulary rapidly so that he can use a wide variety of words in a plethora of unique awkward situations without appearing to redundant with his words.......
<Dave_BroZilla> DON'T YOU DARE STREAMCEPTION ON US
<Equestria> I usually use this name to mess with those in the RP room...
<Locke> TI'm going to say it again. I beleive that Clestia and Luna can both live forever as long as nothing kills them. That and they arn't particulary easy to kill.
<Dermathil> >mfw ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: she could easily go all over and do that
<prince-dari> Episode 2.
<Dermathil> YES
<Dave_BroZilla> HORJAY
<Xiagu> Well like... if sunrise and sunset aren't discrete times, why aren't the princesses constantly moving the sun / moon?
<Sketch> I can be ok with that locke
<killerrabbit> maybe they are?
<Dermathil> FORWARD
<Xiagu> Locke I don't think that anypony has actually disagreed with you
<The_Crowing> im pretty sure the sun rises and sets on a specific time
<killerrabbit> and she did that just for dramatic effect
<prince-dari> >100 years
<prince-dari> >5 billion years into the future
<GGgala> 100 years? NOPE.AVI
*Locke shrugs
<Dave_BroZilla> 12,005, NEW ROMAN EMPIRE
<prince-dari> Dat pumping.
<Dave_BroZilla> HELL TO THE YES
<prince-dari> Dat DIIIIIIIING
<AtomicSleepy> l8r
<Dermathil> DING
<GGgala> hot doctor on TARDIS action
<Locke> So to me Celestia and Luna come closer to ebing Saiyans. In a sense.
<Dave_BroZilla> I remember this epi, when they were showing it on Space Network
<Xiagu> back to the original point, it must be strange not to live in the country ruled by the two creatures with power over the sun and moon
<Dave_BroZilla> alongside a newly started second season of Stargate: Universe
<Dave_BroZilla> Ahh...fuck you, MGM. Killed off an amazing franchise.
<VioletVanilla> 5.5/Apple/26? o:
<GGgala> 5.5-apple-26?
<Sketch> Don't saiyans age?
<Locke> Best I could come with sketch
<Balloons> They do but not as fast.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Sketch> Fair enough
<Dermathil> S:U should've continued.
<prince-dari> SG1 > all other SGs
<Dashite> Dari = correct
<GGgala> >mfw apple is the symbol for 'billion'
<Dermathil> If only because it could've tried to come close to SG1 and Atlantis
<ValtheJean> totally agree with Dari
<Dave_BroZilla> SGU = only SG ever watched
<prince-dari> I watched universe though.
<ValtheJean> it's a shame that season 8+ was just never the same
<Locke> My other theary was that all pony ruled countries have an Alicorn.
<killerrabbit> I mean, we could prove whether the planet is the center of the universe or not
<ValtheJean> after they killed off [SPOILER] it just didn't feel right
<killerrabbit> we just need to compare the stars in the night scenes
<prince-dari> So universe is finished then?
<Sketch> I think we are not given enough information. I think diety implies a level of omnipotent control in creation
<prince-dari> Ohai Ghosties.
<NewDCD> 9it's up
<Dave_BroZilla> Finished with an unfinished storyline
<Dashite> GHOSTIES!
<ValtheJean> howdy Ghosties
<Dave_BroZilla> SO EXCITED
<Dave_BroZilla> *squee*
<Ghosties> 4Someone from Steam told me weird shit was on in Brony State
*Dave_BroZilla goes to check the ponychan thread
<Dermathil> GHOSTIES
<Dermathil> ohai
<Ghosties> 4Hello guys
<Dermathil> YOu missed Prison by an hous
<Dermathil> *hour
<Ghosties> 4So
<Ghosties> 4What are you watching?
<Sketch> But, I think they are immortal, and beneficial rulers as close to diety as you probably get
<Locke> Alicorn= Rally really powerful and indefinate lifespan.
<Dermathil> Doctor WHo
<Locke> To me
<Dermathil> Series 1 ep 2
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Comic: Startle Bits / Surprise! (http://tinyurl.com/3p6xx7c)
<Dave_BroZilla> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/131286237145.jpg
<GGgala> Ghosties! you missed the weird slowmo who
<Dave_BroZilla> SO FUCKIN' BAUCE
<Dashite> Dave, who is that?
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhhh, I see
<Dave_BroZilla> Gokai Red riding Rarity
<Dashite> Oh
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9GRABBIN' DOSH and LOADSA MANNI Luka
<Dashite> First thing that came to mine was Cobra Commander. :p
<Dave_BroZilla> NewDCD, if it weren't for you're already fantastic singing skills, I would definitely love you long time
<Ghosties> 4I see DCD is playing Killing Floor
<Dave_BroZilla> And Luka is mai waifu
<prince-dari> Umpa Lumpas
<Dave_BroZilla> just saiyan
<Locke> So one of the alicorn leaders I had in mind was the one who controlled sound. Sense he could here everything at once all the time he could never here anyone.
<Dave_BroZilla> REPEATED MEME
<Ghosties> 4Well, I'll make my leave now. See you all later
<Dave_BroZilla> kk, pce Ghosties
<NewDCD> 9see ya Ghosties
<Silvermane> well f course the internet would be at the end of the world
<GGgala> Adherents of the Repeated Meme!
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, I know the show had high production values, but I don't think they had that...
<Locke> So he always has to read lips or writing.
<prince-dari> Air from my lungs.
<NewDCD> 9but yeah Brozilla it's a bit sad that the rest of /oat/ is ignoring our game
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Silvermane> and he hits on the tree chick
<prince-dari> BOE!
<GGgala> Doctor/Tree?
<Dermathil> BOE
<Dermathil> THE OH SO AWESOME FACE OF BO
<prince-dari> MEME
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: tbh, I doubt they even considered it in the outline
<Locke> Another was an alicorn who conrolled all the colour and could see colours no one else could because he could see all types of light.
<Dave_BroZilla> indeed, feels bad man. So much potential in it.
<Dave_BroZilla> THIS SCENE MAKES ME MOIST
<Dermathil> LOL
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dave_BroZilla> FIYAh
<GGgala> inb4 iPod
<Dave_BroZilla> FROM DA NOSTRALZ
<Locke> Who knows a word for sound other than Sonic?
<prince-dari> An Earth classic
<Dave_BroZilla> YES
<Xiagu> aural
<Dave_BroZilla> NOT THE RIHANNA FUCK UP
<Locke> thanks
<Dave_BroZilla> BEAUTIFUL
<Dave_BroZilla> RUN AWAY
<Dave_BroZilla> GET AWAY
<Locke> Then ehy where the Alicorns Aural and Chroma.
<GGgala> 5 billion years in the future, Rose is still awkward at parties!
<killerrabbit> ehy?
<Dave_BroZilla> TAINTED LOVE
<Dave_BroZilla> OH WHAOH WOAH
<Dermathil> Yfw THE EVIL GUYS ARE BLACK
<Xiagu> Maybe the other countries have similarly strong rulers who have control over other natural phenomena?
<Dermathil> (black cloaks I mean)
<Dave_BroZilla> But their balls are white
<Xiagu> I'm having trouble thinking of what's left, though.
<Sketch> Would be interesting
*Xiagu turns to Pokemon legendaries....
<Dave_BroZilla> (They're orbed spheres I mean, which are silver)
<GGgala> grid spiders?
<Locke> I'd imagine it would actually be worse to hear everdehing everywhere at once than to just plain be death
<Locke> Xiagu that is exactly what I was talking about
<killerrabbit> I find it too hard to accept that the universe orbits around the planet
<Xiagu> Locke, you made up more alicorns. That doesn't help, we need magical dragons and griffons or something
*Locke shrugs
<Sketch> Rams, totally
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, they're probably not in a full sized universe slash past this point the show doesn't make any sense
<Locke> whatever dood make up your own stuff.
<Dave_BroZilla> Pandora's Moon
<Dave_BroZilla> She's a Na'vi
<Sketch> Heh
<Locke> Plus who said it had to be the universe. they only lift one sun and one moon.
<Locke> Its probably just that galaxy
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: it doesn't matter on the size of the universe, it would mean that the planet would need an enmormous gravity well to have stars orbit it
<killerrabbit> then you have the problem of, how strong are these ponies to survive that high gravity, and still be able to jump/fly/etc.
<Locke> Well the stars don't orbit around it. It is controleed.
<Locke> There is an easy explanation to all of this.
<killerrabbit> so, there is conservation of momentum?
<killerrabbit> er, no conservation of momentum*
<Xiagu> All the lights in the sky ....aren't actually stars then
<Locke> ITS FANTASY NOT SCIFI!
<killerrabbit> I don't care if it is scifi or fantasy, it is still fun to analyse things like this
<Sketch> Different universe, it's hard to argue with any perspective
<Locke> What skethc said.
<Xiagu> Going with the interpretation that Luna put all the stars there, they might not be miasmas of incandescent plasma after all
<Dave_BroZilla> DAT'S RACIST
<NewDCD> 9I think I'll try moving the game to /chat/"
<GGgala> >Rose's face she doesn't notice the loud click-clacking of the spider
<Sketch> They could operate with entirely different rules. Celestial
<Sketch> Sorry, celestia may store the sun as a marble at night
<Dave_BroZilla> >deep south
<Larscis> My goldfish says they mark the location of every Starbucks in the galaxy.
<Sketch> Damn cell phone keyboard
<eXAKR> I need pictures
<eXAKR> Pictures of Nightmare Moon
<eXAKR> Nao
<killerrabbit> so, now were back to that celestia/luna are gods
<Xiagu> !link nightmare_moon
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/35053
<Dave_BroZilla> oh, he mad
<killerrabbit> because the ability to just "pick up" the sun and store it for the night would be quite godly
<Sketch> Would be neat, Lol
<ValtheJean> to be fair, this is kinda an inactive time for people in my timezone
<Dermathil> mfw IT WORKS
<ValtheJean> it might pick up tomorrow morning...or later today depending on where you live
<NewDCD> 9Moved thread to /chat/ http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36494465.html
<Xiagu> I mean, that's sort of what happens right?
<eXAKR> I switched off the Sun
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: I guess, but what about the shape of the planet? it has to be flat in that case
<killerrabbit> but if it is flat, how does gravity work?
<Xiagu> I've been suspecting that Equestria is flat for a while now
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, iiiiii have no clue
<Dave_BroZilla> dat burning sensation
<prince-dari> BAD WOLD
<prince-dari> BAD WOLF

<prince-dari> The tiny blue guy said "it's the bad wolf scenario"
<prince-dari> The fat guy who sits on pillow.
<Xiagu> I think it's powered by friendship
<stephastated> hellooo.
<Dermathil> oh
<killerrabbit> regardless, I still think celestia/luna are gods and not just princesses :D
<Dermathil> I read so fking much about bad wolf
<Xiagu> the ground really likes ponies and wants to be closer to them. The more of a pony there is the more it likes them
<Xiagu> ...I think they're god-tier princesses? :3
<killerrabbit> Xiagu: the ground hates pegasi then eh? XD
<prince-dari> A little boy.
<prince-dari> Wut
<stephastated> agreed with xiagu
<Dave_BroZilla> boy?
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, there's not as much of them, they have hollow bones and whatnot
<Dave_BroZilla> Thought that was a chick
<Xiagu> so it doesn't like them as much, no
<eXAKR> You know
<prince-dari> Digihumans

<eXAKR> Everytime I come across something marked as Questionable on Ponibooru
<Dave_BroZilla> Bronies...explain yourselves
<Larscis> Killerrabit: On the contrary, the ground loves pegasi. It's why they crash into it should they stall in flight.
<eXAKR> I'm like, what questionable
<eXAKR> Then I see it
<eXAKR> Then I'm like

<GGgala> dumb internet!
<Dave_BroZilla> >Lipstick and skin
<prince-dari> Must have just been a phrase
<killerrabbit> but ponyville, the main town/city in the show, was founded by earth ponies, so that is probably why you see more earth ponies than other kinds
<Dermathil> >last human is transgendered
<prince-dari> "Back when I was a little boy"
<Dermathil> PROBLEM FIX'D
<prince-dari> Also, Smith's new screwdriver.

<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> I was playing around with Gross Beat - to create a Gl1tch3d b3at
<FreezeFrame> Which is the key by your number row
<FreezeFrame> (Unless you have a non-English keyboard)
<Xiagu> hey so I was dicking around with a picture I started a while ago

<PsychicKid> Augh, this is insanely making me mad
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> I'll show you. Soon.

<Dermathil> my keyboard changes between 3 different keyboards

<Dermathil> owait
<Plorf> uh
<Dermathil> this ain't SRW Z2
<User_5228> No, Sweetie Belle isn't destined to be a singer
<killerrabbit> User_5228: it is pretty obvious... just sayin
<User_5228> Carpentry is not Apple Bloom's talent
<Octavia> User_5228 troll: unsuccessful.
<User_5228> They all share a talent
<PeterPoneeta> Good Day!

<Octavia> Xiagu wins an internet.
<Dermathil> ~
*PsychicKid punshes his monitor
<Xiagu> Also, that would be a terrible cutie mark, because after they get it..... ?
<eXAKR> MLP:FiM is anime enough
<eXAKR> No need for more anime
<Sketch> http://guiltfreegames.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/pic693451_md.jpg this mat
<Sketch> epic leaf dog thing that I have no idea what is is epic
<Xiagu> Looks like we have to keep crusadin'.... ?
<PsychicKid> Neat
<User_5228> No, see, their Cutie Mark is of a miniature pony with no Cutie Mark
<Topshot> my goat anime
<killerrabbit> what card game is that? lol
<killerrabbit> never heard of battle spirits...
<User_5228> And then they find that pony's Cutie Mark, which is another blank flanked pony
<Sketch> I have no idea, I use it when playing magic. When I play magic. which is like not at all anymore
<Dermathil> NOPE
<User_5228> Whose Cutie Mark is yet another pony with no Cutie Mark
<killerrabbit> I play mtg legacy
<User_5228> and so on and so on and so on
<Dave_BroZilla> FUCK YOU, BITCH WHORE
<Xiagu> ....it would be cool if their talents were helping other ponies find their cutie marks I guess?
<Dermathil> FACE OF BO SURVIVED
<GGgala> BUT WHAT ABOUT HER BRAIN HUH?
<Octavia> User_5228, do paint ships taste that good?
<Octavia> chips*
<Octavia> nvm.
<killerrabbit> fail
<Sketch> but I thought that mat was cool, and it was like 10 bucks, so I was like.. what the hell
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<drf|laptop> 03are you here?
<killerrabbit> meh, I don't use any mats, don't see the point
<Glacymr> 12she's at school D:
<Sketch> the point: they look cool
<Sketch> lol
<Xiagu> also they make cards easier to pick up since they're squishy
<prince-dari> It was flattenised.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dave_BroZilla> Now, see, I couldn't do that
<killerrabbit> and depending on the deck, I need more room than a mat would give
<Xiagu> it's like a +1 bonus or so
<Sketch> true. and tables can be sticky :(
<PsychicKid> Bleh I give up
<Dave_BroZilla> Watch the end of the world, nearly be murdered, and then go back to present day
<killerrabbit> try playing a legacy dredge deck on a mat, not gonna work very well since you need to have your graveyard spread out so you can see what's in it
<prince-dari> TIME WAR
<Sketch> two mats? heh
<PsychicKid> I use 4 mats when I play Yugioh
<Dave_BroZilla> CIVIL WAR
<Ziltoid> dat time war?
<killerrabbit> 2 mats? now that's getting pretty big XD
<prince-dari> The Doctor - Destroyer of Worlds
<killerrabbit> why would you need 4 mats? the max cards on the field in yugioh is 11...
<Dave_BroZilla> But then DAVID TENNANT OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
<killerrabbit> because yugioh has weird limitations like that
<Dave_BroZilla> I really ahve no idea what the whole story is behind it
<PsychicKid> They're stacked on top of each other
*Sketch is in one chat room talking about playmats, deckboxes and cardgames, and is in another room where the bot will let him roll d20's
<Paul_McColtney> Like invisible guns.
*Sketch and they are both brony related.
<PsychicKid> Man why is this so hard ot find
<prince-dari> GWEN COOPER
*Sketch feels very. VERY geeky right now
<prince-dari> OHAI
<killerrabbit> why do you stack the mats? -.-
<Octavia> and i am eating letters.
<PsychicKid> Why not?
<Paul_McColtney> Sketch: Don't
<Xiagu> because stacking the deck is cheating! :D :D :D

*killerrabbit is now considering reviving his yugioh deck
<prince-dari> Ok, cya.
<GGgala> He says that Gwen looks familiar, and asks if her family goes back to the 1860s...
<GGgala> or something to that effect.

<Sketch> Luna, Twilight Sparkle, and then it gets muddled from there but mebbe Rarity Next.. or AJ

<Sketch> Really just go on EquestriaDaily and seach for 6-star
<Dave_BroZilla> Not everywhere
<Polarfire> ah. lol

<Dave_BroZilla> But at formal occasions as it calls in my university career
<Paul_McColtney> What he said.
<FreezeFrame> I love the historical figure episodes

<GGgala> ahahaha yes FreezeFrame. the episode in which Agatha Christie must solve a murder mystery
<FreezeFrame> After Donna comments on meeting Agatha Christie and having a murder mystery occur.

<Xiagu> They're cute in moderation? Sock fillies are adorable.
<Sketch> it's kinda a strange thing, but whatever, heh
<GGgala> "open the rift", they're dying or something
<Xiagu> Never really clicked with anypony else full grown in socks
<Flamerunner|TF2> Trixie should be Demoman
<Dave_BroZilla> ahh, couldn't hear that
<Flamerunner|TF2> just because i want to see Spike Soldier VS Trixie Demoman.
<VicViper> speaking of tf2
<VicViper> someone rar a steam installation and send me it
<Paul_McColtney> yeah no.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Why? it's free

<yenguyen> i just though this was going to be a full on pony chat all the time lol
<VicViper> not being able to use steam is driving me absolutely crazy
<Plorf> I think everyone is TF2

<Polarfire> >CWC?
<VicViper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S51H-aygMw
<Plorf> If this was 100% ponies I would have left as soon as I started (which was yesterday)
<Aponymous> I don't give half a shit about anything he does. So, whatever.
<Sketch> but occassionally we do get into pony rants
<Sketch> there was a good god/demi god discussion a while ago
<yenguyen> ooh rants?
<Octavia> like earlier today
<Polarfire> who is CWC?
<Flamerunner|TF2> What the FUCK does that have to do with installation VicViper
<drf|laptop> 03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/koma-comic-strip-glee-fml.jpg
<yenguyen> i was just about to ask what there is too rant about!
<NewDCD> 9Sonichu dude
<Octavia> nitpicking.
<Aponymous> You're better off not knowing...
<ValtheJean> ...
<ValtheJean> OH GOD
<Dave_BroZilla> oh dear lord
<VicViper> what
<NewDCD> 9just saying, a lot of people were scared that he might be a brony. And he apparently is. So yeah.
<ValtheJean> NOT HIM
<GGgala> ohh that guy
<Sketch> mostly
<ValtheJean> well gents
<Xiagu> hey so, who here has played Story o fthe Blanks?
<ValtheJean> it's been great
<FreezeFrame> He didn't fangush Queen Vickie
<GGgala> gonna go back to ignoring him then
<ValtheJean> I love being a brony, but BAIL
<FreezeFrame> Feh, you always get a few crackpots in any fandom

<Plorf> I have
<FreezeFrame> Look at pro wrestling and "IT'S STILL REAL TO ME, DAMMIT!"
<ValtheJean> whyyy....why him...
<Plorf> It is sufficiently creepy
<prince-dari> This is the end.
<VicViper> Yeah, I downloaded that
<NewDCD> 9"The latest known reference to MLP made by Chris was on the Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia forum, where Chris used a picture of Applejack from the more recent My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic animated series as his avatar, although his screen name was modeled after the name of another major character in the series- Rainbow Dash."
<prince-dari> Sorry guys. :P
<GGgala> NewDCD: WAT
<Xiagu> I'm drawing some fanart, and I'm sort of wondering what is left to do besides mess with the stroke thickness
<Topshot> why would they all sleep on eachother like that
<FreezeFrame> I have succesfully remained ignorant to anything CWC has done.
<GGgala> what is that a quote from?
<ValtheJean> would anyone mind if I cried myself to sleep?
<Xiagu> ...and EquestrianStudy is embroiled in a discussion about Sonic / Zelda or whatever
<yenguyen> i got sent that and the weird creepy luna game by a friend that got me into the show
<GGgala> a wikipedia article about Chris-chan and MLP?

<Flamerunner|TF2> Art of the Dress in 8bit reminds me of Lavender Town
<ValtheJean> lol DCD, I'm playing that rom you linked right now :P

<Senor_BroZilla> bah, keeps cutting out
<ValtheJean> okay yeah...that's pretty badass DCD
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time to go to sleep, then work on Happy Luna fic in the morning before going off to geek out with board games in the evening.

<VicViper> It is powerglove level
<Sketch> meh, 7 is vista. Just, moar bettah

<Plorf> Worst OS I've ever seen.
<VicViper> why would I ever even give microsoft my money

<VicViper> Well no abbreviation for me
<Sketch> I'm just kidding killerrabbit, it's mostly not like that any more
<VicViper> Sorry for sounding like a robot but uh
<Sketch> VicViper, check to see if your encoding is UTF-8
<Aponymous> It keeps freezing on me too, but my connection seems to go to shit at night anyway...
<VicViper> What the hell does that even mean
<VicViper> There basically is not anything on here at all
<Senor_BroZilla> It was going just fine before I double-chatted....
<VicViper> I cannot run anything through search like services or dxdiag or ipconfig
<Sketch> ah wait, I forget not everyone is using a chat client
<VicViper> nothing like that
<GGgala> mine's freezing too, but at least it's not skipping ahead when it starts again
<Sketch> disregard :)
<VicViper> Nah it is just another one of this computerès problems
<Senor_BroZilla> offline?
<Sketch> éé fun.
<Senor_BroZilla> wat
<Pizzicato> Man I need a pony hit today.
<Senor_BroZilla> now it works
<Pizzicato> Today has sucked balllllllllllllllllllz.
<Senor_BroZilla> so confuzed
<GGgala> same here
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<VicViper> If you see them out of place itès because I donèt want to not abbreviate my sentences and sound like a robot
<GGgala> had to click the tiny refresh button
<prince-dari> Freezing usually means your connection isn't fast enough for the stream.
<Pizzicato> Any photographers here? 'cause you'll get this. You ever shoot a roll of film, go 'HOLY SHIT I GOT SO MANY AWESOME PICTURES', develop it, and go 'Okay I am never shooting in aperture priority mode, nor am I ever shoot at 1.8 ever again'?
<prince-dari> Maybe I'll lower the bitrate.
<Sketch> hmm, interesting. It's all of you ' <<
<Senor_BroZilla> I have four out of five from my internet connection
<Senor_BroZilla> five bars*
<Topshot> lol

<Senor_BroZilla> not sure why this is such an issue
<Sketch> >>your
<Psyentific> >He shoots with film
<Psyentific> Haw haw
<Aponymous> Yeah, I have to keep moving my laptop, but it's working fine now.
<Octavia> Pizzicato, all blurry?
<VicViper> I just noticed that my left eye is slightly blurry
<Psyentific> I just noticed that I'm legally blind
<Pizzicato> Pizzicato: One some of them, yeah.
<Pizzicato> They didn't develop evenly, either.
<Sketch> http://fav.me/d3ixs32 < fluttermac
<Octavia> film has one advantage over digital
<Topshot> pizzicato what do you shoot with
<GGgala> agh it did it again
<Pizzicato> Topshot: Minolta X-370 with a Rokkor 50mm 1.8 and Ilford 3200
<Pizzicato> I got one keeper out of the roll http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/photomragraphones/good_shot.jpg
<Octavia> you can fake it with image bracketing, though
<Pizzicato> And it is a pretty good shot.

<Psyentific> Interesting.
<Umbreon> 12nooo
<Psyentific> Pizzicato: Do you shoot art or commercial?
<Pizzicato> That was scanned with a flatbed scanner, not a negative scanner.
<Psyentific> I'm guessing art.
<VicViper> anyway does anyone here like the gradius series
<Pizzicato> Psyentific: Dude, Ilford, film? Yeah, art.
<Pizzicato> Low light candid photography is my thing.
<Psyentific> I see.
<Pizzicato> What do you shoot?
<Psyentific> Actually it's my father that does the shooting. He shoots Microstock
<Skipsy> I like to shoot with my 50mm 1.4, awesome low light, but soo shallow
<Psyentific> Mostly though, he just futzes around in Photoshop.

<Paul_McColtney> Uhhh..
<GGgala> epic opening is epic
<Polarfire> XD
<prince-dari> Have you seen a blowfish driving a sports car?
*killerrabbit doesn't watch very much television at all
<Paul_McColtney> Let me guess, Family Guy?
<Polarfire> YES
<VicViper> ADVENTURE TIME
<Flamerunner|TF2> Futurama is awesome
<Polarfire> I HEV
<Flamerunner|TF2> You shut your face
<VicViper> family guy sucks too
<Polarfire> XD
<Psyentific> Oh hey. An interview with Sansha Kuvakei. BRB Nation Calls.
<Flamerunner|TF2> i agree with that.
<Paul_McColtney> killerrabbit says a guy on a pony website.
<Plorf> Yeah, I don't watch TV at all.
<Octavia> http://troll.me/images/futurama-fry/not-sure-if-troll-or-just-very-stupid.jpg.pagespeed.ce.1SF6k7CeCk.jpg
<VicViper> I hate tv
<VicViper> the only thing they do is like
<VicViper> display my games on them
<Flamerunner|TF2> I wonder if Derpy is mexican
<GGgala> least evil badguy ever. he even obeys the traffic lights
<VicViper> derpy is equestrian
<VicViper> stupid
<Plorf> If you say Ramirez I can only say
<killerrabbit> Paul_McColtney: I only watched ponies because an irl friend of mine gave me a dvd with the first few episodes on it :P
<Plorf> RAMIREZ! DEFEND THE BURGERTOWN!
<Flamerunner|TF2> LMFAO
<Paul_McColtney> That's still watching TV.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Plorf
<Flamerunner|TF2> TAKE MY INTERNETS.

<NewDCD> 9DAT HEADSHOT
<Polarfire> hello again again again... again.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Oh my
<Flamerunner|TF2> i just though of Derpy in MW2
<Flamerunner|TF2> . _ .
<Plorf> Probably would use the noob tube incorrectly
<VicViper> you should probably cleanse that thought
<VicViper> with a bullet
<Paul_McColtney> Grenade launchers are already used incorrectly in COD anyway
<prince-dari> Ohai Spike
<prince-dari> Where's Buffy?
<SpyroD> 6COOL, did you make that beat, thing?
<eXAKR> bbl
<Jazza> Bloody grenade launchers
<Paul_McColtney> OMG! L337 360 Gren8de launcher double kill ftw
<Paul_McColtney> your all noobs
<GGgala> that reminds me of a FiM fanfic's tags...
<Paul_McColtney> I have a n00b tube
<Plorf> 360 midair noscopes
<GGgala> "Angel/Spike, no Buffy"
<Plorf> Call of Duty has a terrible community.
<Paul_McColtney> that's why I hate CoD
<BlacklightShining> …noob tube?
<Flamerunner|TF2> Vic
<Flamerunner|TF2> shut up
<prince-dari> LOL
<Flamerunner|TF2> DO IT.
<prince-dari> I didn't see that.
<Flamerunner|TF2> WITH A SOOOOOOOOCK.
<prince-dari> THIRSTY
<prince-dari> BLOOd
<killerrabbit> terrible community for a terrible game, makes sense to me
<BlacklightShining> ??
<prince-dari> OH NOES
<Jazza> Yes it does Plorf
<Umbreon> 12kk
<prince-dari> That had to be a reference.
<Jazza> But I still play it
<Flamerunner|TF2> Derpy would be a great sniper
<Jazza> I was playing it this morning, in fact
*Octavia tucks her socks under her.
<GGgala> had to
<Jazza> Then I put on BFBC2
<Flamerunner|TF2> ... i'm not kidding.
<alphaJackal> hi
<Plorf> I have Black Ops from a friend, but the spawns in that game...
<Paul_McColtney> I prefer me too Jazza
<VicViper> I wear one black sock and one white sock
<Plorf> *shudders*
<VicViper> does that make me cool
<Plorf> So many flaws ;_;
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Yup.
<Jazza> I haven't played it in months so it was difficult to get back into it
<Redox> hay!
<Plorf> Extremely unbalanced gameplay.
*Flamerunner|TF2 doesn't use socks on his hooves
<Jazza> I guess I've adapted to CoD and Halo's aim assist too much
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> It's sometimes easy
<Plorf> It doesn't have aim assist?
<Plorf> That's pretty cool.
*Redox neighs
<Flamerunner|TF2> They always burst into flames >_<
<VicViper> should I get a PS1 for $10
<Jazza> Yes it has none. I've heard people argue that it does (only a little bit) but from my experience it has NONE.
<Plorf> On a console, that's really weird.
<Icy> Ayumi?
<Jazza> So adjusting from CoD's EXTREME aim assist to BFBC2's no aim assist was bloody difficult
<VicViper> guys
<VicViper> should i get a ps1 or what
<Jazza> (after months of not playing BFBC2)
<Jazza> Yes Vic
<Plorf> I'm more of a Halo guy.
<VicViper> what games should I get
<Jazza> I would buy a SNES
<Plorf> ... Mega Man 8?
<Redox> anyone seen johnny guitar?
<GGgala> ha spike is a nerd
<VicViper> I have an NES
<VicViper> and a Sega Genesis
<VicViper> and a Wii and a DS and an xbox 360
<prince-dari> He's still badass.
<VicViper> but those three arenèt actually mine
<GGgala> hallo RainBroDash
<Flamerunner|TF2> Vic

<Dashite> It's only 1:50am...
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Huh.
<Jazza> SNES is the place to be
<Jazza> I loved it
<Jazza> An emulator just isn't the same -_-
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> ?
<GGgala> they're fight-fucking, oh boy
<Polarfire> its almost 1 for me.
<killerrabbit> I liked the n64 more than the snes
<SpyroD> 6errrr. what?
<ValtheJean> hey man, I *wish* I was on East coast time, it'd make hanging with other bronies A LOT easier
*Jazza gasps
*Octavia used a ps3 for a render node using beowulf, thats about it.

<Aponymous> Murder rehab? Damn, 25th century sounds awesome.
<ValtheJean> I mean like, I'm grateful as hell that you have been streaming for so long
<Octavia> Adventure and Warlords, best atari 2600 games ever

<Larscis> Or at least aluminum studs, since unlike lead paint, they're used in buildings these days and will pass inspection.
<Pyroh> I cant understand why
*RainBroDash might actually be watching Scuzz. Isn't sure any more. comment still stands.
<Jazza> Try it out on a different computer in the same room
<Jazza> To eliminate the wall variable
<Jazza> Are you using wired or wireless? There could be interference
<Pyroh> Maybe my Router is dieing

<Pyroh> Its worked pretty good until recently
<Pyroh> And nothing has changed

<Pyroh> Oh
<Pyroh> Yes
<Pyroh> She is
<Jazza> Ask her to try it in your room
<Polarfire> yew can do it hurr durr
<Pyroh> She cant just move it
<Jazza> There could be interference
<Pyroh> And its 3:13
<VicViper> why not try plugging into your router
<Pyroh> No, i know it isnt
<Jazza> Yes, plug directly into your router
<Pyroh> Because When her PC is off
<Jazza> You must eliminate variables to find the solution
<Pyroh> I still have horrible internet

<Jazza> SillyNilly that would be AWESOME
<Polarfire> I lost about 5 lbs this summer. But I'm pretty skinny already and I need to exercise more than I need to loose weight.
<VicViper> you have to cut it up to eat it
<Pyroh> Cause my PC is in rouge shape
<prince-dari> >Spike screws everyone over
<Jazza> Possibly
<Pyroh> Crackign screen, Missing keys
<prince-dari> >manages to kill no one
<Jazza> Just eliminate the variables
<prince-dari> Fail.
<SillyNilly> Enjoy your meal Pizzacato!
<Pyroh> Had a Shiz load of viruses once, Had to get it whiped
<Jazza> That's the only way to find the issue
<Pyroh> Well i know my sister isnt the probleme
<Pyroh> Nor the Motem
<Pyroh> So its obviously my PC
<Jazza> Your connection

<VicViper> one time I saw someone with a scattergun that had a description on it
<Pattyrick> It goes well

<Plorf> Syringes :<
<VicViper> say hi to god for me
<Pattyrick> How 'bout you?
<Polarfire> ...
<Pyroh> yay
<VicViper> And all I could do was laugh
<Pyroh> Hooray for syringes
<Polarfire> oh shi-
<Xiagu|Inkscape> ...someone's medigun had a description ending with ``we are now yiff buddies'' or something like that
<Xiagu|Inkscape> I was greatly amused
<sotha> It's too late.
<Plorf> I can imagine Pyro going around with the Stately Steel Toe, Sight For Sore Eyes, Postal Pummeler, and whatever else
<GGgala> sorry baby!
<Umbreon> 12bored
<Polarfire> D:

<Pattyrick> I know what you mean
<Pyroh> You should
<Pyroh> Because i can do everything
<Pyroh> AND ANYTHING

<Xiagu|Inkscape> I actually managed to not cut myself at all with one of those knives, though granted I was only cutting a bunch of paper with it
<Polarfire> HEY!

<Umbreon> 12doesn't everyone?
<Xiagu|Inkscape> it's waaaay too red for real blood.
<GGgala> prince-dari voice is best voice

<Pizzicato> Human blood is barely red, it's mostly yellow, actually
<VicViper> http://cinemassacre.com/2011/07/29/ninja-baseball-batman/
<Xiagu|Inkscape> well.... when you bleed it is red, though a much darker red
<Xiagu|Inkscape> it also dries brown
<Xiagu|Inkscape> and your'e right is is pretty yellow/brown too
<sotha> She can control it?!
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Pony Music Compo (http://tinyurl.com/3e6lmzy)
<Polarfire> WAT A TWEEEST
<Pizzicato> Oh I'm sure My Little Pony News will highjack that article!
<Flamerunner|TF2> I'm giving my TF2 a full Medic Aperture combo :P
<Pizzicato> It's like those guys never post any original content, what's up with that?
<Pyroh> Meet the medic, Is the best Meet The so far
<Pizzicato> I actually write for MLP News. If something breaks on EQD, we source and give credit.
<Pizzicato> I liked Meet the Engineer.
<Flamerunner|TF2> ^this
<Pyroh> Meet the Medic is just so.....AWESOME
<Pizzicato> Though I think I'm saying that now 'cause AJ is my favourite pony.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Hey look buddy, i'm an engineer
<Locke> I thought meet the medic was pretty unfair
<Pyroh> AppleJack?
<GGgala> WELP
<Polarfire> FUCK
<Pizzicato> Meet the Soldier is really good, too.
<sotha> sword arm
<Flamerunner|TF2> Meet the Medic was the shit.
<GGgala> that sure is awkward
<Pyroh> That isnt how you spell PinkiePie
<Locke> It as longer than all the others had more in it and got so much time to be made
<Paul_McColtney> Meet the Spy was Amazing!
<Flamerunner|TF2> i lol'd with Meet the Soldier
<Aponymous> Yeah, I've been there.
<Pyroh> Meet the Medic is the best
<Flamerunner|TF2> UNLESS IT'S A FARM
<Pyroh> Period.
<Pizzicato> Yeah, the closing line is brilliant.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Meet the Spy made spies 20% cooler
<Polarfire> o_0
<Locke> everyone else was just sorta screwed over when it came to the medic's video.
<Pyroh> ARCHEMIDES, NO!
<prince-dari> Terminator!
<Paul_McColtney> I personally think Meet the Spy is the best because it was just dramatically epic
<GGgala> wait what?
<Locke> I agree
<Flamerunner|TF2> "He could be you, he could be me! he even could-"
<Flamerunner|TF2> *ded*
<GGgala> he seems like a random target...
<VicViper> I think it is pretty late in TF2ès lifetime to still have any meet the team videos left to release
<Pyroh> The best part is probably with the Spy head
<Paul_McColtney> See He'll turn red any second
<Pyroh> Kill me
<Pyroh> Later
<VicViper> the game has been out for almost five years, seriously valve
<prince-dari> He's a PM or something.
<Paul_McColtney> See RED! No Wait that's blood
<prince-dari> Strategic choices.
<Pizzicato> Meet the Pyro is all that's left?
<AtomicBrony> http://is.gd/Jfv7C9
<Paul_McColtney> It won't take THAT long
<Pyroh> Yup
<Paul_McColtney> Pyro:Meet me
<Locke> knowing valve it will
<Paul_McColtney> What.
<Pizzicato> Meet the Pyro is going to some seriously epic shit.
<Pyroh> I know
<Pizzicato> It's been FOUR YEARS, man.
<Paul_McColtney> Pyro: Meet me
<Paul_McColtney> Medic: Later
<Pyroh> But i think there delay is because he cant talk
<sotha> Oh. THey're setting up for the invasion. . .
<Flamerunner|TF2> Pyro: Meet me
<Flamerunner|TF2> VALVe: Later.
<Flamerunner|TF2> HL2 EP3: Make Me
<Plorf> Pretty much
<Paul_McColtney> nah
<Flamerunner|TF2> Gabe Newell: Later
<Plorf> Pyro is my favorite class, I hope they make it awesome.
<Pyroh> I used to like Pyro
<Paul_McColtney> Valve Fans: Announce it
<Paul_McColtney> Gaben: Later
<Pyroh> But i like the Medic WAY more
<Fooby> I can't stand Pyro.
*Xiagu am such a good M1+W pyro
<Pyroh> ....
<Fooby> Because 75% of pyros can't play worth shit unless they're capitalizing on crits.
*Pyroh slaps fooby
<Umbreon> 12hi LL-XBL
<Fooby> Pyroh, I will bitchslap you back if you're an Axetinguisher-FlareGun-Degreaser pyro.
<Fooby> Tell me you're not.
<Flamerunner|TF2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGK5HEu4tU8&feature=related Pinkie looks cute.
<Pyroh> A what with a what now?

<Polarfire> curse this torchwood, it drives me to spending brony teim.
<Pyroh> Da?
<Pizzicato> I hear Medic from Heavy's and Demos the most.
<Pyroh> Ya
<Pyroh> And Soldiers
<Lycan> :c
<Pyroh> I heard Medic from a medic once
<Lycan> It's like the Final Fantasy paradox all over again.
<Pyroh> I was like Da fuq?
<Pizzicato> Haha.
<Lycan> They call it Final, and yet they keep making more.
<GGgala> beth has a cunning plan for suicide by cop
<Pyroh> lol
<Pizzicato> I'll heal a medic if they're low on health.
<Pyroh> 2 medics healing each other
<Pyroh> TIME PARADOX
<Pizzicato> Bitches, when I go Medic, the team doesn't need another Medic.
<Flamerunner|TF2> ^happened to me once
<Flamerunner|TF2> only medic
<Pyroh> I killed a spy once
<Lycan> Watch me create a Time Paradox.
<Pyroh> With my medi gun >:3
<Flamerunner|TF2> then suddenly
<Pizzicato> Man it always happens to me.
<Pyroh> BOO YA
<Lycan> I just created a Time Paradox.
<Flamerunner|TF2> 9 medics
<Flamerunner|TF2> in a team of 7.
<Pyroh> WE HAVE 6 MEDICS
<Pyroh> What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Pizzicato> I've always had good luck not getting a bunch of Medics.
<Pizzicato> I'm not a battle Medic, at all, I'm pure defence.
<prince-dari> You dead.
<VicViper> i like to go medic and not heal anyone
<Pyroh> We had a team with 3 Heavies, 3 Medics(Including me)
<Pizzicato> VicViper, there are people like that.
<Pyroh> It was friggin MAYHEAM
<Pyroh> 3 Ubercharged Heavies
<Pyroh> Massacre
<sotha> Okay. I have to go after this episode ends.
<VicViper> one time while i was playing medic a sniper called for a medic
<Lycan> By claiming that I have, which is to state that I have indeed created one, yet one has not been created. Oh wait. No.... I didn't create a time paradox. I just lied. ._.
<VicViper> and i ran up behind him and shouted into my mic
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Aponymous> Me too
<Xiagu> Pyroh, I have gone clone raiding at a LAN party with 7 heavies on one team
<Pyroh> LOL

<GGgala> lol princess horse
<Lunasta> I don't see why people like 2Fort so much
<Pizzicato> There's no winning on 2Fort.
<Pizzicato> For a Medic, at least.
<Lycan> Or leg pumps. Or whatever.

*Octavia puts cold hooves on Atomics back.
*Ray yanws and goes to play something
<Spitfire> *you're
<Polarfire> ...wow
<AtomicBrony> You know, someone should invent a word that covers "bro" and "pony" togeth--*shot*
<Dashite> I'd never be able to go that long without a hair cut.
<Umbreon> 12:<
<Pyroh> Do not care bout spelling
<Polarfire> meh.
<Lunasta> I don't know the words to it from memory
<Lunasta> only the damn tune
<SillyNilly> Why are you always getting shot?-- *shot*
<BitZero> AtomicBrony, sooner or later, I shall run out of bullets.

<SillyNilly> Who the hay is shooting at us?!
<Spitfire> Pobro

<Dashite> When its long enough that I have to comb it after stepping out of the shower it's time to get it cut again. :p
<Plorf> Hasbro
<Spitfire> I don't think there is any term that could do that, AtomicBrony
<Pyroh> Bro's Before Hoe's
<BitZero> Stoprighttherebro.
<Polarfire> I comb it every time.
<Spitfire> *Bros before hoes
<Polarfire> But my hair isn;t vey long.
<Polarfire> and of dari
*Lunasta tinkers with the shotty so that the biometric scanner will release the safety to BitZero and hands it over

<AtomicBrony> Also OH MY GOD COLD HOOVES ON BACK
<Polarfire> *ok
<Pyroh> .....
<Lunasta> There, you won't be running out of ammo now.
*AtomicBrony chases after Octavia with a pillow
<Pyroh> Spitfire....you just downgraded that sentance
<Pyroh> What did that accomplish
<BitZero> Thank you.
<Spitfire> No need for apostrophes
<Pyroh> BUT I LIKE THEM!
<Polarfire> ... I give up. Is it pony music?
<Dashite> It was humming!
<Pyroh> And i will keep them
<Zephyr> aw, someone has this name already
<Polarfire> It was D:
<Spitfire> I DON'T CARE!!! I am a grammar Nazi and you will OBEY
<Dashite> Woo!
*Octavia squeeel!s and runs away laughing!
<Pyroh> If you have a probleme, take it to the Basket Ball court
<AtomicBrony> Also, according to me, Rarity is a Creeper
<Spitfire> Don't do that
*Dashite looks around for his gift
<Pyroh> Wait........
<Lunasta> !seen Mongoose
<DerpyBot> Lunasta: The last time I saw Mongoose was Mon 08 Aug 2011 01:06:40 PM CEST
<Spitfire> PLEASE
<Polarfire> you just got it bro
<AtomicBrony> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi24yLYwZ_M
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Rarity is a Creeper
<Pyroh> How do Ponies play Basket Ball
<Fooby> Magic
<Fooby> everything is magic
<Dashite> But... but! What a ripoff!
<Spitfire> Why do you do this to me Pyroh
<Octavia> lol Atomic
<Pyroh> Do ponies play Basket Ball.....huh
<Umbreon> 12o.o
<Fooby> Also -- the same way they play football
<Ludovician> Of course they do.
<Pyroh> Hay for thought
<Dashite> No! It's all mine!
<Dashite> Mine I say!
*AtomicBrony chucks a pillow at Octavia...hits Rarity.
<Ludovician> Hoof(foot)ball makes more sense than basketball but both are plausible
<Rarity^> It.
<Dashite> Could I get it in writing?
<Rarity^> Is.
<Rarity^> ON.
<Polarfire> so what was the tune?
*Octavia claps happily!
<Lunasta> Friendship = Magic, Magic = Life, Friendship = Life?
<Polarfire> FUCK
<Polarfire> HOW DID I MISS THAT??
<Pyroh> Ponies clap?!
<Polarfire> naah it was heavenly.
<Pyroh> I thought we stomped our hooves on the ground instead
<Dashite> GOD DAMMIT POLARFIRE! WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SWEAR SO GOD DAMN MUCH?!
<Polarfire> I'm just stoopid at 3 am.
<Ludovician> Both!
<Polarfire> ...
<Xiagu|Alseep> Pyroh, that's called ``clapping'
<Xiagu|Alseep> '
<Polarfire> u mad bro?
<Pyroh> In PonyVille it is
<SillyNilly> The clicking of hooves produces an interesting sound.
<Pyroh> Apprently
*Ludovician attempts to clap human-style and falls backwards.
<Dashite> Yes. I am absolutely furious.
<Polarfire> ....
<Polarfire> yep dari you were right.
<Polarfire> So dari how many different programming languages do you know?
<Lunasta> Ludovician, y u no sit down?
<Polarfire> for lack of a better question
<Lunasta> Didn't you watch Twi do it?
<Pyroh> Wow, Rainbow's house is PIMP
<Spitfire> Ludovician your legs can wobble and bend. Did you see how Celestia waved in Sonic Rainboom? They flopped all around the place
<Ludovician> Yes but twi has magical powers
<Pyroh> Its more of a mansion than a house actually
<Polarfire> .... Stuff you can work with. Like anything more than the basics I guess.
<Ludovician> I'm an earth pony.
<Plorf> Where do they show her house?
<Polarfire> yeah, let's just go with that.
<Octavia> they show her house twice
<Octavia> party of one is good one
<Octavia> griffon brush off
<Pyroh> In Various episodes
<Xiagu|Alseep> Her house is different each time
<Polarfire> which ones?
<Octavia> well, its a cloud
<Lunasta> I'd assume that errypegasus's house can be made at will
<Pyroh> Is anything in the backround EVER consistant?
<BlacklightShining> cloud house *
<Pyroh> That would be a no
<Ludovician> Very true
<Lunasta> But you have to factor in it being a cloud
<Polarfire> Java? *bows*
<Ludovician> Colgate occasionally misplaces her horn.
<Polarfire> Which one did you start with?
<Lunasta> Hides it in her hair is a nice and simple solution to that mystery
<Polarfire> ah.
<Ludovician> It's retractable?
<Pyroh> Seriously, Once i swear i saw 2 Backroun ponies standing next to eachother
<Polarfire> did everyone else leave? :S
<Lunasta> I was thinking Poison Joke like
<Ludovician> yea I thought that too but didnt want to say it :p
<Pyroh> Orbit
<Lunasta> Well that or she can REALLY hide her thick hair
<Polarfire> D:
<Ludovician> heh
<Pyroh> Space Orbit
<Pyroh> In my Spacesuit
<Polarfire> wow. tough intro.
<Ludovician> Dad, are you space?
<Lunasta> Yes son, I am space
<Polarfire> yeah : /
<Ludovician> SPAAAAAAACE!
<Dashite> format C:
<eXAKR> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to eXAKR for 20 minutes
<Pyroh> Wanna watch me
<Ludovician> curious now, how did the space core get integrated with ponies in the first place?
<Pyroh> Buy a teleoscope
<Umbreon> 12noooo

<eXAKR> Yessssssssssssssssssssssssss
<Lunasta> Two words: Pinkie Pie
<Plorf> ^
<eXAKR> !helanga

<Plorf> Wormholes.
<Ludovician> I saw the Anthology vid, is that the source?
<Helanga> 12no birdie for you

<Pyroh> With no money....

<Dashite> No.
<Polarfire> ...
<Xiagu|Alseep> Nah, Dash'll give her one for free. :D
<Dashite> At least nothing installed right now.
<Polarfire> good luck with that.
<Lycan> A buck. Rainbow Dash, I am disappoint.
<Octavia> thaaaats, entirely innapropriate, though funny.
<Ludovician> I don't think Dash needs the money, derpy's there probably gonna pay $111111
<Polarfire> yeah that's true.
<Dashite> I'm a fan of opening e-mail attachments from people I don't know.

<Dashite> He said he was from some country in like Africa or something right...
<Fooby> Couldn't you just watch me like a Gryphon?
*Ludovician throws a cake at Pyroh.
<Dashite> Anyway, he said he had like $25 million
<Dashite> and he needed my help to get it out of the country
*Pyroh eats cake in mid air
<Pyroh> :3
<Polarfire> AND HE WAS GONNA GIVE ME 50 MILLION DOLLARSSSS!!!!!!111!!!
<Pyroh> Thank you!
<Xiagu|Alseep> I'll watch you like a Gryphon, Fooby.
<Dashite> so he was going to transfer it all into me account and let me keep like half of it!
<Ludovician> No problem
<Pyroh> :3

<Polarfire> lol yup
*Lunasta pulls out his second shotty and loads it with the choco mini-muffin slugs and starts shooting into the air

<Lunasta> Pacific time!
<Ludovician> I've done that last 2 nights. Supposed to get some sleep for studying but cant help but pony it up all night
<Fooby> West coast is best coast
<SillyNilly> 4:00 am at my location
*Lunasta high hoofs Blacklight
*Fooby brohoofs my Pacific buddies
*Ludovician brohoofs you.
<Lunasta> Hellz yeah!
<Helanga> 12o-o
<Polarfire> I <3 you
<Plorf> [leaving for Canada, back in a week]
<Ludovician> Later
<Polarfire> :D
<Pyroh> Remeber, Only shank when shanks are deserved
<Dashite> Polarfire x Dari
<Lunasta> Adieu Plof and bon voyage
<Dashite> *clopclopclop*
<Ludovician> Hey guys im thinking of writing a ponyfic. mind if I ask some questions about some ideas im having?
<Polarfire> I'm ok with this
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 13 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<Lunasta> Hit us Ludo
<Polarfire> :3
<Ludovician> ok so
<Polarfire> hey dari are you ever going to visit the US?
<Glacymr> 12nooo
<Ludovician> its an alternate universe one
<Ludovician> Beta name Equestrion for now, until i think of something better
<Ludovician> Main difference is, Luna's in charge.
<Ludovician> But Luna gets taken back to Equestria in episode 1 and the story is about a few ponies who go to try and 'rescue' her
<Polarfire> you should come see me.
<Lunasta> So a color opposite of Equestria?
<Polarfire> I will buy your food.
<Ludovician> define color opposite?
<Polarfire> :P
<Spectrum> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY Has this been linked here yet?
<Polarfire> EEEEEEeyesIam.
<Ludovician> It's mostly the same except for the pony in charge. But since it's Luna they suffer from eternal night which stunts plant growth and life is less carefree
<Lunasta> Like Black i s White
<Lunasta> Oh
<AtomicBrony> !Link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Friendship is Magic Bitch
<Lunasta> Well wait
<Ludovician> It's still a concept
<Spectrum> "Do you like bananas?"
<Polarfire> ...
<Polarfire> down to 3.
*Ludovician likes them apples.
<Polarfire> so what next?
<AtomicBrony> ...but what about THEM apples?
*AtomicBrony points to the other half of the grove.
<Polarfire> how about some sex? :P
<Lunasta> The portal to Equestrion is the moon I'm guessing
<^BlacklightShining> Ludovician: also check out #EquestrianStudy
<Ludovician> I haven't figured that out yet. I'm toying with the idea of having Derpy split between worlds explaining the derpness
<Lunasta> So Equestrion is basically the opposite of Equestria
<Polarfire> dashite?
<Ludovician> thanks blacklight. I went in there earlier but didnt see anypony talking
<Spectrum> "You're going to go bananas..."
<Spectrum> "ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!"
<Dashite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o
<Ludovician> In a way
<Ludovician> It's mostly the same. However they won't spend much time there since they will be going to Equestria near the beginning
<killerrabbit> that flash animation was so random
<Ludovician> So's your name.
<Polarfire> ...
<killerrabbit> although, imo, it would have been funnier if luna messed up celestia isntead of getting launched to the moon
<Ludovician> Well then u should be in this discussion
<Ludovician> cause thats the beginning of the concept of my story
<Ludovician> still there lunasta?
<Lunasta> So: Eion is polar opp of Eia
<Lunasta> and Eion needs Luna?
<Lunasta> So the ponies cross over to Eia
<Ludovician> yeah pretty much
<Lunasta> to get Luna
<Lunasta> Got it
<Ludovician> I plan to have them interacting with the mane cast of the show, but following the general timeline of the series
<Dashite> >bag on head
<Dashite> >it still counts
<Polarfire> ... wtf is that featured video
<Ludovician> Does it seem like a decent idea, or do I need to rethink it?
<Lunasta> So they interact in the same timeframe as the show, but in between the episodes?
<Polarfire> >.>
<Polarfire> wellokthen!
<Lunasta> It's not bad if you can work it out.
<Ludovician> Or during the episodes with other characters. For example some characters are absent for parts of the show and for entire episodes sometimes
<^BlacklightShining> …wow
<Polarfire> I know what we're going to do.
<Ludovician> I'm going to need to plan it out but im hoping to make it reasonably long
<^BlacklightShining> total Trollestia
<Polarfire> http://www.ponyspin.com/
<Ludovician> brb though gonna get my food before it gets cold, eating in here thop
<Ludovician> tho
<Lunasta> Well stories can only work if the author can work it out
<hotwheels14901> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<hotwheels14901> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps hotwheels14901
<hotwheels14901> !makeout
*DerpyBot gives hotwheels14901 a searching look and then flies off to #EquestriaAfterDark
<Ludovician> So what do you think about the idea of Derpy existing simultaneously in both worlds?
<Polarfire> dari?
<AtomicSleepyAgain> G'night
<Polarfire> He's disappeared :O
*Lunasta stabs Atomic with a double dose of Lunasta
<Ludovician> u leavin?
<Polarfire> RELEASE THE DOGS
<Dashite> I saw movement on the screen!
<Lunasta> Stay with me dammit!
<Lunasta> No sleeping
<Polarfire> oh nevermind.
<Polarfire> there he is.
<Polarfire> XD
<AtomicSleepyAgain> ...isn't Lunasta a sleep aid?
<Dashite> Then need to edit the sound clip better. :(
<Lunasta> No, that's Lunesta
<Lunasta> I do the opposite of that
<Polarfire> spinspam is the best spam

<AtomicSleepyAgain> Oh
<AtomicSleepyAgain> Well good--
*AtomicSleepyAgain facesplats.
<Polarfire> inb4 me too XD
<Dashite> This just makes me think of the other spin site. :/
<Polarfire> ...
<Dashite> And it really disturbing.
<Polarfire> meh.
<Polarfire> There are worse
<Dashite> Because I'd rather not associate ponies with that.
*Ludovician wishes his food was a plate of cupcakes. Damn chicken....
<Polarfire> not that I would know >_>
<prince-dari> We were on the other spin site at school a while ago.
<prince-dari> Some guy just said.
<Lunasta> Heh, I had some dino nuggets an hour or so ago
<Polarfire> ...
<prince-dari> "It's...Hpynotic"
<Polarfire> lol
<Dashite> Was about to say exactly that! :D
<Ludovician> some what?
<prince-dari> XD
<Lunasta> dino chicken nuggets
<SillyNilly> Lunasta, your name conjures up images of Luna indulging in a fresh plate of pasta.
<Ludovician> I thought u went to sleep
<Lunasta> Why does this chat not know the nomnomnominess of dino nuggets?
<Polarfire> dari give me some warning if you fall asleep
<Ludovician> They probably do
<Lunasta> No, that was Atomic
<Dashite> Dari
<prince-dari> How? :P
<Dashite> Beep. :D
<Polarfire> idk. write a script.
<Polarfire> :P
<Ludovician> and it seemed a few other ponies left as soon as I started talking about my story lol. I saw 4 simultaneous logouts :p
<prince-dari> A script that messages the channel if my pulse drops enough? :P
<Polarfire> why not.
<Polarfire> you're a genius.
<Polarfire> :D
<Lunasta> Hah, that's probably the people who just idle in here
<prince-dari> I need to find something to take my pulse first. XD
<Polarfire> lol.
<Ludovician> one of them was Pyroh
<Lunasta> Like that one ^^^
<Ludovician> So yeah if u answered i didnt see it
<Ludovician> any feedback about derpy?
<Ludovician> hi
<MrMooMoo> Hello bros.
<Lycan> Super Mario Bros?
<Lunasta> Heyo MrMooMoo
<Polarfire> This was the wrong choice.
<SillyNilly> Helloo MisterMooMoo
*Ludovician moos.
<Polarfire> It killed chat and made us all even sleepier than we already are.
<MrMooMoo> Hopefully there will be moar cows in season 2..
<Lycan> There's a pony for that. http://www.deviantart.com/download/210671359/super_mario_bronies_by_supersheep64-d3hff27.png
<Octavia> Ludovician, it is not my type of story. I can not give you proper opinions.
<^BlacklightShining> lolwut?
*Lunasta looks for his sticky launcher and runs off to the nearest Verizon office
<Dashite> You are already asleep. i.imgur.com/evYeo.png
<Polarfire> Dari?
<prince-dari> Yeah?
*Lunasta arrives and plants sticky bombs all over and hits the detonate button
<Lunasta> VERIZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON

<Lunasta> Nah, takes too long with detonating only clusters at a time
<Lunasta> DerpyMail USPS STAMPS!?!?!
<Lunasta> Woah
<Polarfire> XD
<MrMooMoo> Woah people use stamps?
<^BlacklightShining> OH YEAH!
<Polarfire> So skype? before I perish at the hooves of spinning applebloom?
<^BlacklightShining> DERPY STAMPS!
<MrMooMoo> Do they taste good?
<SillyNilly> Gilda: Stamps, woohoo.
<Polarfire> if you want
<^BlacklightShining> (for the rare times I actually use the US postal service…)
<^BlacklightShining> OH YEAH!
<Lunasta> WHY HAS MY DAD NOT MENTIONED THIS TO ME!?
<Polarfire> LOL
<Dashite> >mfw I've been singing that for the past 3 minutes now
<Lunasta> Heh, anything going through the mail is usually junk, bills, and mostly packages
<Polarfire> lol.
<MrMooMoo> Stamps are held up by glue. •_•
<Polarfire> ...
<Polarfire> DOHOHO
<Dashite> A "hole"
<Polarfire> what hole? :P
<Polarfire> I see...
<Polarfire> Hey dari since we are supposed to be linked, what am I thinking?
<Ludovician> Great, now make stamps for australia so i can use the
<Ludovician> m
<Polarfire> think hard
<Polarfire> you can doo eet
<Dashite> Don't hurt yourself.
<Ludovician> I'd mail a blank piece of paper just to send the stamp to someone
<^BlacklightShining> lol
<Polarfire> ok maybe not that hard.
<Ludovician> woops, *somepony*
<Polarfire> SSSSS
<Polarfire> SSSSS
<Polarfire> SSSUUUU
<Lunasta> Why waste a sheet of paper when you can just send the envelope?
<Dashite> He's thinking about pony.
<Polarfire> SSSSUUUUBBBBBB
<Ludovician> because they would probably notice it's empty and not send it
<Dashite> Subaru!
<Polarfire> SSUUUUBBBWWW
<killerrabbit> why do they care if it is empty?
<Octavia> why ruin a stamp with a post mark?
<Polarfire> well yeah that, everyone thinks pony
<Ludovician> dunno lol
<MrMooMoo> Send stamps to youre self
<Polarfire> dude you just said it pretty much.
<Polarfire> subwuh
<Polarfire> subwah
<^BlacklightShining> pointless ^
<Polarfire> YES :D
<Dashite> Subw-Mr Sub
<Ludovician> Also, random question since im new to this, I was looking through EqD and im wondering, where did the term 'shipping' come from?
<Lunasta> How about sending a stamp inside the envelope that
<Lunasta> has been cancelled
<Lunasta> so the recipient has two stamps
<Ludovician> sounds good
<Octavia> relation-shipping.
<Ludovician> ah.
<Polarfire> you can turn it off XD
<Lunasta> Shipping usually means romantic interests between two chars
<Ludovician> yea i knew that i was just wondering about the origin of the word
<Dashite> Keep it going! How long can you take it?!
<Balloons> Not really but in this fandom, yeah.
<killerrabbit> Ludovician: shipping has been around for a long time
<Polarfire> but it provides good BGM for the chat
<Dashite> Survival of the fittest!
<Ludovician> yea but i havent
<Polarfire> hey dari, are you gonna finish this video too :P
<Polarfire> all the way to the end?
<^BlacklightShining> I ship stamps with Derpy
<BitZero> I stamp ships with Derpy.
<Polarfire> lol.
<Lunasta> I Derpy stamps with ships.
<Polarfire> bleh.
<Ludovician> er.. blacklight.. i dont even... what?
<Polarfire> facts are subjective.
<MrMooMoo> Derpy stamps ships with I.
<BitZero> With stamps Derpy I ships.
<^BlacklightShining> I stamp the sides of mail-related government property (mail vehicles, mailboxes, etc.) with solid colors, then Derpy
<Polarfire> stream you playing the pacman google doodle.
<^BlacklightShining> Ludovician: you know the (relation)shipping thing?
<MrMooMoo> Ships stamp Derpy with I.
<Polarfire> click it XD
<Ludovician> ya
<Polarfire> It just goes to... a page.
<^BlacklightShining> one might say, for example, ‘I ship Lyra with Bonbon’
<^BlacklightShining> (…I guess…)
<MrMooMoo> Favorite ship. Go!!
<Ludovician> thats what I thought u meant, hence my response
<Lunasta> With ships Derpy stamps I
<Polarfire> http://www.google.com/pacman/
<^BlacklightShining> so I'm making fun of that with the whole Derpy postage stamps thing
<Dashite> I notice that the add doesn't include best pony...
<MrMooMoo> DerpyxStamps
<^BlacklightShining> ‘I ship stamps with Derpy’
<Lunasta> IJNS Yamato!
<Lunasta> Oh, wait THAT kind of ship
<^BlacklightShining> meaning, I send postage stamps with Derpy on them…
<BitZero> I ship the Titanic with icebergs. It never ends well.
<^BlacklightShining> yeah
<^BlacklightShining> I Titanic the Ship with icebergs
<^BlacklightShining> I with icebergs Titanic the Ship
<Lunasta> I iceberg the ship with Titanics

<^BlacklightShining> Ludovician: …and now we're just randomly rearranging the words in these phrases
<^BlacklightShining> XD
<Ludovician> eeyup

<Polarfire> good job dari :D
<User_2640> Hey there ponies. Can anyone tell me the most known MLP forum? Its a shame EQD doesnt have one...
<Polarfire> XD
<killerrabbit> I don't browse mlp forums :/
<Lunasta> Ponychan I guess
<Dashite> GAME OVER!
<MrMooMoo> Ponychan.net
<Polarfire> D:
<Polarfire> lol. too much ghosties
<killerrabbit> are image boards considered forums?
*Ludovician adds Ponychan to favourites.
<Polarfire> so what now?
<User_2640> nope :S
<^BlacklightShining> :O
<^BlacklightShining> rare!
<MrMooMoo> Theyre better
<Polarfire> you're not online are you dari?
<killerrabbit> eh, I prefer regular forums
<Polarfire> yeah
<Polarfire> meh.
<killerrabbit> having to post pictures everytime you want to start a topic is annoying
<Polarfire> Dashite does yoo have eet?
<^BlacklightShining> usually ponies like User_2640 join, stay a few seconds without saying anything, then leave the channel or quit with client quit
<Lunasta> I don't really know if there are really any major forums
<Dashite> http://i.imgur.com/KwneF.gif
<Dashite> Maybe...
<User_2640> well do you WANT me to quit? :D
<Ludovician> can always just post one of the million and a half random pinkie pie pics out there
<^BlacklightShining> no…
<^BlacklightShining> it's better with more ponies
<killerrabbit> well yeah, but that isn't the point :P
<MrMooMoo> Theyres a lot of pony threads on like every forum
<Polarfire> dari I love you.
<Dashite> http://i.imgur.com/duEA0.jpg
<User_2640> So anyway let me tell you about my crazy idea i got yesterday.
<Lunasta> Hit us
<MrMooMoo> Yes.
<FallSilently> A Dash/Applejack ship?
<BlacklightShining> …don't hit me
<FallSilently> Revolutionary
<BlacklightShining> I've been humiliated enough
*Octavia laughs into her hooves
<Lunasta> !seen DerpyBot
<DerpyBot> Look into my eyes.. 6_9
*DerpyBot puts her front hooves on Lunasta's shoulders.
<MrMooMoo> Hetrosexual relationshipping?
<Lunasta> I see the derp... 6_9
<User_2640> While surfing the web i noticed the 3D ponies(even IRL) dont look as nearly as good as the 2D ones.
<Octavia> MrMooMoo, now thats an odd concept.
*BlacklightShining glares at Octavia
<BlacklightShining> it's NOT FUNNY
<killerrabbit> they have a hard shape to make 3d
*Octavia laughs more
<FallSilently> So you suggest steamrollering all ponies.
<Lunasta> It's the shading 2640
*BlacklightShining would fly off in a huff, but…you know
<MrMooMoo> Have you seen garrys mod ponies?
<Polarfire> hmm you didn't show up? I reload
<Octavia> there are good 3d models
<Octavia> just look on da
<Lunasta> The show is very bright but IRL the lighting and shadows and sometimes the material quality isn't up to what we expect
<User_2640> So i thought - what is the best way of doing a game (non flash) that would be 2D to look good and be very fun to play.
<Polarfire> there you are.
<Polarfire> :3
<MrMooMoo> I still want full TF2 pony mods.
<Polarfire> :D
<User_2640> And it hit me - an adventure game!
<killerrabbit> User_2640: uh... that is insanely broad
<FallSilently> Cell-shading would work, if that's not too retro
<Ludovician> RPG?
<Polarfire> hmm so skype then?
<Ludovician> Platformer?
<Polarfire> ok.
<Ludovician> PonyDuels?
<Polarfire> lol.
<MrMooMoo> Shooter?
<Octavia> !link http://rivenchan.deviantart.com/#/d3js6c2
<User_2640> Like if any of you know the old broken sword series
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Lunasta> I quite like cel-shading
<Ludovician> lawl TASTE THE RAINBOW
<Octavia> sorry, http://rivenchan.deviantart.com/#/d3js6c2
*Octavia bangs her script in the head with a bowstring, "Stop prepending."
<Lunasta> O.o?
<User_2640> point and click 2D adventure. the problem with this would be that a lot of 2D art would be needed, like characters and backgrounds
<Dashite> IT
<Dashite> IS
<Dashite> TIME
<Dashite> FOR
<Dashite> SLEEP
<FallSilently> Good morning
<Lunasta> Whatever happened to that pony dating sim?
<MrMooMoo> Its not canceled
<Paul_McColtney> *Flutterguy* I don't wanna talk about it.
<Lunasta> Are they still doing the 3 versions?
<User_2640> and i found out the most suited engine for it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Game_Studio
<FallSilently> Dating sims...
*FallSilently facepalms
<FallSilently> As if this fandom couldn't get any more creepy....
<MrMooMoo> I never played a mlp flash game
<Ninja_Wizard> What's so creepy about dating a charater from a little girls tv show?
<eXAKR> !check facebook.com
<ScriptBot> It's just you. http://facebook.com is up.
<Ludovician> Well I kinda creep myself out sometimes thinking bout fluttershy...
<eXAKR> lies
<Ludovician> I mean
<killerrabbit> there has been much worse done to them than a date, /shrug
<MrMooMoo> Meh theyre teenagers too
<eXAKR> !check http://lifehacker.com/
<ScriptBot> It's just you. http://lifehacker.com is up.
<FallSilently> ...they're ponies....
<FallSilently> ....why has nobody mentioned that yet....
<Ninja_Wizard> shh, not so loud.
*Octavia hands FallSilently a slightly larger pin for the bubbles to burst.
*FallSilently accepts gratefully and adds it to his collection
<MrMooMoo> Spike: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Lunasta> I'm not really looking forward to the finished product as I am of the reaction to it
<killerrabbit> they're ponies yes, but they have very human qualities to them
<MrMooMoo> Im not physically atracted to ponies
<Lycan> Neighter am I.
<killerrabbit> people can easily be attracted to the personalities and not the physical body
<MrMooMoo> Eeyup
<Lycan> Oh my Luna. Did I just unintentionally make a pun?
<Lycan> :|
<Lunasta> Personification to a large degree
<MrMooMoo> But the human art..
<Lunasta> Yep that's a pun indeed Lycan
<Lycan> *hoofpump* AWESOME.
<Octavia> regardless of anything, we're all still sitting on the internet in a mlp irc channel. derp.
<Lycan> *or pawpump cuz I ain't got hooves*
<FallSilently> Suddenly awkward in here....
<BlacklightShining> …not really?…
<killerrabbit> personally, I want to check out the date sim when it is done, /shrug
<Lycan> But still. Fanart's making it increasingly hard to not be attracted to cartoon mini horses. <__>
<MrMooMoo> Its the internet. You cant be awkward.
<Lunasta> Meh, whenever I play a date sim I look right for where the cheats are :D
<Lycan> Fanbase y u complicate my feelings for Twilight Sparkle??
<Octavia> up up down down brings new meaning to cheat code.
<MrMooMoo> Lycan: Me too!!!
<killerrabbit> Octavia: that was painful to read -.-
*Octavia bows graciously.
<Ninja_Wizard> The real question is, why do you have feelinsg for Twilight? Fluttershy is better.
<BlacklightShining> …okay, NOW it's awkward
<MrMooMoo> Without the fanbase my favorite pony would of been fluttershy
<killerrabbit> I like fluttershy, but not in that kind of way ;)
<Lycan> Cuz she's basically me, as a girl. And as a pony. With magic.
*BlacklightShining silently drops out of the conversation
<Octavia> my sinicism mute button is broken.
<Lycan> And lives in a library.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: New Comment System Going Up Soon! (http://tinyurl.com/453slz6)
<Lycan> And has a pet dragon.
<Lycan> And knows a goddess personally.
<Ninja_Wizard> Pft.
*Lunasta shoots Octavia "Thanks a lot for that image"
<ZekeS|AFK> *yawn*
<Lunasta> What is zis?
<ZekeS|AFK> g'morning
<Lycan> And. Okay she's not just like me. But we're roughly got the same personality. -._-. And I'm a Tara Strong fan.
<Lycan> It's called prefrences. And I haz em.
<Lunasta> Hide! It's Fireant!
<MrMooMoo> Fanart made me like Twilight for some reason.
*Lunasta ducks in a barrel
<MrMooMoo> I like Tara too
<Ninja_Wizard> All preferences are wrong.
<killerrabbit> ha, I got first!
<Ninja_Wizard> Except for mine.
<Lycan> Then I don't want to be right. :3
<Ninja_Wizard> It's ok, you are not.
<killerrabbit> twilight is my favorite... romantic interest of the ponies
*Octavia is in the topic. She wins.
<Octavia> haaa
<ZekeS> fix'd
<Octavia> i saw that coming
<killerrabbit> lol
<MrMooMoo> And Twilghts purple. I like purple.
<Lunasta> Ha! Now I'm in the topic
<Octavia> you win now!
<ZekeS> You don't realize just how much crap you have installed until you ata-secure-erase and start anew --;
<Fireant> Trolololol~
<Fireant> LOLOLOL LOLOLOL, TROLOLOLOLOOOOO!
<ZekeS> Suddenly, a mayor mare fan appears!
<Fireant> AHAHAHAH! OHOHOHO!
<Lycan> Hmm... Octavia.
<Lunasta> What did you do ZekeS?
<MrMooMoo> Wat.
<ZekeS> Fireant: err, you ok?
<Lycan> What instrument do you play again?
<BitZero> Did someone break Fireant?
*FallSilently plays a mean air harmonica
<Octavia> depends on who you ask
<Ninja_Wizard> Harmonicas are the devil.
<Lycan> I'm asking you.
<Lycan> I mean, you should know better than anypony.
*Sketchy_Sounds wakes up
*FallSilently flings air harmonica at Wizard
<Fireant> A wild Fireant appears!

*Sketchy_Sounds yaaaawns. "Morning"
<BitZero> Electric Piccolo, you mean.
<Fireant> Fireant uses "Topic Change"!
<Octavia> In all honesty, I am currently playing a viola. Tired of the bickering.
<FallSilently> Bickering?
*Sketchy_Sounds glomps Octavia
<MrMooMoo> Glomps?
<Lycan> Alright. So. I'm gonna assume Cello.
*Lunasta counters with Muffin Slugs
<Lycan> And if so. Then Octavia! I dare you!
<killerrabbit> MrMooMoo: when you jump and hug someone at the same time
<killerrabbit> a diving hug, basically
*Octavia tickles Sketchy_Sounds
<FallSilently> It's safe to Google Images "glomp." I had to.
<Lycan> Challenge THIS composer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA2hh9FLHbM
<Lycan> ...to a Cello solo.
*Sketchy_Sounds flails!
<MrMooMoo> Hmm.
<Lycan> TO THE DEATH.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I just woke up! XD
<Lycan> On the mouth of a volcano!
<FallSilently> On Jurassic Park

<BlacklightShining> (inb4 User_3986 quits, client quit)
<Lunasta> Good luck on it not breaking on arrival Octy
<killerrabbit> BlacklightShining: you are so negative
<Octavia> Lunasta, on arrival?
<BlacklightShining> but it's accurate!
<Lycan> Yay~
<killerrabbit> actually, it wasn't
<killerrabbit> they just changed chans :)
<Lycan> I want learn piano.
<Lunasta> You did choose DerpyExpress right?
<BlacklightShining> well…okay…not client quit, just left…
*Octavia laughs, "oh heavens. I did not think of that."
<killerrabbit> (and apparently don't know they can be in multiple channels)
<Octavia> fedex = derpyexpress.
<BlacklightShining> …but I knew it'd either be client quit or channel leave!
<BlacklightShining> uh-uh
<BlacklightShining> FedEx < Derpy Express
<Octavia> fedex delivered my new laptop, it had every corner dented in on the box
<killerrabbit> I would never use derpyexpress :P
<BlacklightShining> Octavia: the laptop?!
*BlacklightShining shakes his head
<BlacklightShining> wow…
<Lunasta> Ponibooru derping up again?
<Balloons> !mail Killerrabbit To bad!
<Octavia> BlacklightShining, the box the box the laptop came in was

<Lunasta> UPS is much better than FedEx
<Lunasta> But the USPS is still much cheaper
<Lycan> inb4CEPTION
<Octavia> i did not have a choice for either, sadly.

<BlacklightShining> inb4 Artaelian quits, client quit, no reason *
<killerrabbit> spammer
<MrMooMoo> !seen a doctor
<DerpyBot> MrMooMoo: Sorry, I haven't seen doctor lately.
*BlacklightShining is not a spammer
<Lycan> We create the world of the fandom. Then we go in there and fill it with our memes.
*BlacklightShining shakes his head
<BlacklightShining> (I WAS RIGHT)
<Lunasta> Eh?
<BlacklightShining> You create the world of the fandom. You bring the subject into that fandom, and they fill it with their memes.
<MrMooMoo> Inb4 inb4
<Lunasta> Netsplit? or DC?
<Lycan> Yeah. That.
<killerrabbit> DC for you
<BlacklightShining> inb4 Binky-TheTravelAgent quits, client quit, no reason
<Lycan> Then you go in there and rickroll?
<BlacklightShining> [02:10] BlacklightShining: inb4 Artaelian quits, client quit, no reason […]
<BlacklightShining> that prediction… ^
<Sketchy_Sounds> Wharrgarbl
<BlacklightShining> …it was right
<killerrabbit> BlacklightShining: at this rate, you might as well just make a script that spams that
<killerrabbit> everytime someone joins
<BlacklightShining> no, only when somepony new joins that's on the Flash client
<FallSilently> Artaelian's still there?
<killerrabbit> Im sure a simple regex could solve that
<Lunasta> Blech, who's downloading their collection on my network again...
<BlacklightShining> and I don't know how
<BlacklightShining> XD
<MrMooMoo> lol im on ipod
<killerrabbit> just query them and see if they're on b00mer -.-
<killerrabbit> and tht would probably be good enough :D
<Ludovician> so im back, what did I miss?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Me waking up
<MrMooMoo> Secret but fun
<Sketchy_Sounds> and realising I'd left my netbook on all night
<MrMooMoo> INB4 INB4
*Ludovician throws a cake at User_5160.
*Balloons
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...oh my gosh that means you were all here while I was sleeping oO
<killerrabbit> !
<BlacklightShining> secret but fun ≠ secret butt fun
<Lunasta> Why? Were you dreaming up saucy images?
<Artaelian> someone wanted me just then?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Maybe? :3
<Sketchy_Sounds> @ Lunasta
<BlacklightShining> I don't think so, Artaelian
<MrMooMoo> There is no sauce on any images that i know of.
<MrMooMoo> On herr
<Artaelian> BlacklightShining, why did you think I'd quit the chat when I only just got here?
<Lunasta> Don't mind him, he's just nuts
<BlacklightShining> I am not!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Mostly everyone's mad around here
<MrMooMoo> Nein.
<killerrabbit> re, and I
<killerrabbit> asdfasdasfdsafadsfads
<Artaelian> well whatever, I'm more talkative in the study... when people are there and I'm not busy writing
<BlacklightShining> Artaelian: it's because most non-regulars that join just hang around for a few seconds, then quit, client quit, no reason or nick reason
<killerrabbit> thanks firefox for segfaulting AGAIN
<Lycan> (. )__( .) ...
<BlacklightShining> especially ones on the Flash client
<Lycan> I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole... diggy diggy hole! I'm digging a hole...
<Artaelian> BlacklightShining, I've been here over a week, I just said I talk more over in the study than on daily
<MrMooMoo> Pros go on irc on mobile.
<killerrabbit> the flash client doesn't allow custom quit messages for some reason
<killerrabbit> kind of weird
<BlacklightShining> …oh
<BlacklightShining> derp!
<Sketchy_Sounds> It doesn't?
<Lunasta> Is there a way that I can block connections from the ethernet ports of my router?
<killerrabbit> no, I joined recently and tried to do one
<Lunasta> I think I know which PC is downloading their collection
<killerrabbit> and it just posted my username XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> I was fairly sure it did
<killerrabbit> well, /quit <message> didn't give me a custom message
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pretty sure it did for me the other day.
<killerrabbit> ...but it DCd me from the server still
*Sketchy_Sounds shrugs

<Sketchy_Sounds> !flip
*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands safely on her hooves
<Octavia> http://i55.tinypic.com/296ghvk.jpg
<Lycan> ...I love the Adam West batman show.
<Sketchy_Sounds> ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON
*killerrabbit goes off to grab an otter pop
<killerrabbit> or two... :D
<Lycan> It's so... bad... it comes full circle.
*Sketchy_Sounds misread that as "otter poop"
*Octavia likes Aliens. made the reference.
<Nightseas> 12Someone might think I'm you if I use that name anyways lol
*Ascendant shrugs
<Sketchy_Sounds> I approve @ Octavia
<Ascendant> not like I ever use it
<Ascendant> use magicalrainbowponies or something
<Lycan> I saw the cat woman episodes yesterday.
<Ascendant> sounds like silverwind well enough
<Nightseas> 12XD
<Lycan> lolmiluna.
<Lycan> I quote this as a Line from Robin:
<Lycan> "Cat woman, you are not a nice person!"
<Sketchy_Sounds> OH NO
<Lycan> Said while hanging onto a plank over a pit of hungry tigers.
<Sketchy_Sounds> TOUGH WORDS THERE BOY WONDER
<Lycan> ....
*Octavia groans at the derpitude of mail she gets since buying a Nook.
<Lycan> Did the hub just stick Terry McGinnis, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie into the same machine just now during the commercial break?
<Lycan> Do they not fear the reprocussions of such an act?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering they stuck Pinkie Pie and Megatron in the same song for something before, I think it's safe to assume they do not.
<Lycan> YOU FOOLS, YOU'LL DESTROY US ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Nightseas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nightseas, you are a 3Genesect.
<FallSilently> Anyhow, I think I'll be totally impulsive and go have my breakfast BEFORE the Nightly Roundup hits.
<Lycan> :c
<Lycan> Wow.
<FallSilently> Never know what I'm gonna do next.
<Lycan> Joker was lame before Mark Hamill.
<FallSilently> See yiz in a bit.
<Nightseas> 12!weather 88001
<Nightseas> 12The "and" in "Lugia and Articuno" needs to be pink instead of green xD
<Lycan> Well... Jack Nicholson did a good Joker.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Jack Nicholson's Joker was pretty darn good
<Lycan> But The Joker from the original batman TV show?
<Lycan> Total. Fruitcake.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yep
<Nightseas> 12But that's just me
*Sketchy_Sounds noms cookies
<Lycan> I still can't get over the fact that Robin got defeated by an angry cat though.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Of course he did
<Lycan> Yep. Still hung up on the cat woman episodes.
<Ascendant> It's not green
<Sketchy_Sounds> Robin was the butt monkey to the extreme in that show
<Ascendant> Better?
<Lycan> I gotta see the episode with the shark spray sometime. XD
<Nightseas> 12Much better
<Nightseas> 12Thanks
<Lycan> The fonz jumps the shark, batman sprays it.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Have you ever seen the 60s Batman film?
<Lycan> Don't think I have.
<Sketchy_Sounds> "Fortunately we're both in tip-top shape. It'll befaster if we run!"
<Sketchy_Sounds> Actual line from the film.
<Lycan> wut
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm not even kidding
<Lycan> faster than what, walking?
<Ascendant> no problems
<Ascendant> I'm going to shower, do random crap, then be back in 1-2 hours
*Octavia yawns quietly, stretching.
<Lycan> faster than... opening the door, getting on the floor, everyone walk the dinosaur?
<Sketchy_Sounds> No, than taking the Batmobile somewhere. To be fair, I think where they were going was like quite difficult to get to by walking
*Sketchy_Sounds tickles Octavia mid-yawn
*Octavia yipes! "Hey! Not fair."
<Lycan> Faster than taking a car that has ROCKETS attached to it.
<Lycan> :|
<Sketchy_Sounds> Turnabout is fair play, my dear! :3
<Sketchy_Sounds> And yes, Lycan
<Lycan> WUT
<Sketchy_Sounds> **quite difficult to get to by road, pardon me
<Sketchy_Sounds> Cos it was like in the middle of the city or something
<Sketchy_Sounds> I dunno
<Sketchy_Sounds> The 60s Batman film is basically the show but turned up to eleven.
<Lycan> Why can't he just like... use the gadgets on his car to clear whatever obstacles in the way...? o_O
<Lycan> The thing is literally a Deus ex Machina on wheels.
<Nightseas> 12okay
<Nightseas> 12Seeya
<Sketchy_Sounds> I don't recall the exact reason they decided to run
<Sketchy_Sounds> Although it does lead to a hilarious sequence of them running in front of the sort of shot that would usually be used for driving.
<Ascendant> well, my bro's going to shower first
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...oh lawd and that reminds me
<Sketchy_Sounds> There's then the bit with Batman running while carrying a bomb
<Sketchy_Sounds> And I don't mean a small explosive device with a timer
<eXAKR> When was that?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I mean a classic huge metal thing with a burning fuse
<Lycan> Awesome.
<Lycan> ZAP!!!
*Octavia shows Sketchy_Sounds, http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/38570

*Octavia cries! Alfalfa!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or 7oco7

<eXAKR> Ah
<eXAKR> ._.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hahahah
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have that
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's hilarious as it's just made up nuttiness
<Sketchy_Sounds> It has all sorts of silly stage directions in it
<Octavia> "My god, it's like the child of a Vai and Satriani solo mated with the child of a Malmsteen and Hammett solo, and that child smoked a bowl of Chuck Norris." ....looool
<Octavia> oooh, i wanna listen to satriani now
<killerrabbit> yeah, it's all made up, doesn't follow proper sheet music rules :P
<Octavia> ooooh my, surfing with an alien!

<Ascendant> huh
<Ascendant> ĬNŚĄNĚ ŁUĠIĂ: lol only if i knew how to logg in and join the chat O_o
<Ascendant> Maybe that's another reason...
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well I think we made her day. XD
<Nightseas> 12LOL
<Ascendant> but then again people are idiots
<L[a]korv> nini Kyu.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pfffhahaha
<Nightseas> 12May I?
<Ascendant> I should make a "The guide to IRC for dummies"
<Ascendant> and seeya Kyu
<Sketchy_Sounds> "remove valve" "sell mute"
<Kyu> 07lol
<Kyu> 07well
<Ascendant> May you what?
<Nightseas> 12Tell him how to enter chat
<Sketchy_Sounds> I never noticed that second one before XD
<Kyu> 07as I've said since january
<Nightseas> 12:D
<Ascendant> he just left
<Kyu> 07we just need a link to the chat directly from the forum
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> I was thinking about making a topic
<Nightseas> 12Yes, we do
<Ascendant> But hey, who reads topics?
<Kyu> 07only a few people look at the actual site often
<Ascendant> Get Articuno to stick a link to the java or to irc://irc.lugia.us:6667/Silverwings
<L[a]korv> irc://irc.lugia.us </solved>
<Ascendant> or something
<Ascendant> exactly
<Ascendant> yeah
<Kyu> 07if any O_o
<Ascendant> I bet newbies look at the main site
<Ascendant> it's how they find TST
<L[a]korv> also it should be /#Silverwings. Mind the #.
<Ascendant> No, it's /Silverwings
<Shaico> Did I just miss a music discussion?
*Shaico curses.
<killerrabbit> yes
*Octavia nudges Shaico
<L[a]korv> How can it be /Silverwings when that doesn't define the channel type or distinguish between nicks?
*Shaico nudges Octavia back.
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://lostinthecloud.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/faeries-aire.gif We were giggling over this.
<Octavia> Those were fantastic. I have not laughed that much in awhile.
<L[a]korv> but well, I should be off for now.
<Nightseas> 12lol NS XD
<Ascendant> Well, I swear it was /Silverwings
*Sketchy_Sounds grins
<Ascendant> Because the last time I try /#Silverwings or such it put me into ##Silverwings
<L[a]korv> well that's silly.
<Shaico> LMFAO
*Octavia looks at the time and sighs, "I must go, everypony."
<Shaico> Wtf is this? xD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Awww
<Octavia> Shaico, is that not just great?
*Sketchy_Sounds hugs Octavia
<Ascendant> could be client
<Sketchy_Sounds> Catch you later :3
*Octavia hugs Sketchy_Sounds gently.
<Octavia> I will not be back till late tomorrow. Or is that, today? Something.
<Ascendant> Works both ways, L[a]korv
<Shaico> My eyes.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Shaico: it is awesome.
<Ascendant> ...I think
<Octavia> Have a good day!
<Shaico> I'll pay someone so much money if they can play this.
<Sketchy_Sounds> XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering the directions, I doubt it
<Ascendant> Actually mibbit is retardifying without the /#, so you're probably right
<Shaico> "Balance your chair on two legs."
<Shaico> Indeed.
<Larscis> Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C Sharp Minor?
<Sketchy_Sounds> "Like a Dirigible"
<FallSilently> Wow, this place went up-scale in my absence.
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://lostinthecloud.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/faeries-aire.gif That, Lascis.
<Larscis> Hmm...Rachponinoff's Prelude in C Sharp Minor would fit this group better.
<Sketchy_Sounds> **Larscis
<Shaico> Lost it at "Moon-walk."
*Sketchy_Sounds giggles
<Larscis> Oh, that
<Larscis> We'll get the London Symphony Orchestra right on it
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ha
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or at least we would if London wasn't on fire.
<Larscis> Okay, then we'll get the Boston Pops Symphony Orchestra right on it
<Larscis> Because Boston is a suburb of London, right across the lake
<Larscis> Come to think of it, by that logic, Nairobi is also a suburb of London
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...o_O
<Ascendant> ...lolwut?
<Sketchy_Sounds> It'd be nice if the settlers had had some more imagination with their place names.
<SummerRain> Hey Sketch.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hiya Summer

<klaxa> i'm 6 hours ahead
<klaxa> 12:25 pm over here
<Sketchy_Sounds> Somewhere in central Europe then klaxa?
<klaxa> yep
<klaxa> germany to be exact
<Sketchy_Sounds> Aha
<SummerRain> I am going there in October.
<SummerRain> I have family up there. (Not bloodline related, but family is family)
<Sketchy_Sounds> Wie geht's? :p
<SummerRain> what? XD I don
<klaxa> gut, danke :)
*Sketchy_Sounds hasn't spoken German much since secondary school
<SummerRain> *I don't speak German, but I know SOME words.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Gut gut
*klaxa has spoken german every day since i learned it as a baby
<SummerRain> my Mother speaks for me there
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ja, ich sprache ein bisschen Deutsch.
*killerrabbit knows extremely minimal german
<Sketchy_Sounds> Aber, sehr schlecht. Sorry, this is likely horrible. XD
<klaxa> i'm surprised you guys know a bit german
<klaxa> nah i'm sure any german person would have understood that
<Sketchy_Sounds> klaxa, taking a modern language is mandatory in school over here.
<klaxa> but german is a horrible language to learn ;_;
<klaxa> like srsly...
<SummerRain|WASdisconnected> sorry guys
<Sketchy_Sounds> Amen to that!
<SummerRain|WASdisconnected> disconected
<Sketchy_Sounds> Thing was
<Sketchy_Sounds> In first year of secondary school I had been learning French
<Sketchy_Sounds> But then we moved
<SummerRain|WASdisconnected> :p
<Sketchy_Sounds> and the secondary school I came into had no room left in French classes
<klaxa> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> so they chucked me into German instead.
<SummerRain|WASdisconnected> join #EquestrianStudy
<Sketchy_Sounds> Still
<Sketchy_Sounds> On the plus side, it meant when I got older I could at least understand bits of Rammstein songs when I heard them.
<Sketchy_Sounds> DU HAST MICH GEFRAGT UND ICH HAT NICHT GESAGT
<Sketchy_Sounds> And so on
<FallSilently> I did German in school, but I've forgotten most of it.
<FallSilently> Ich habe es alles vergessen.
<klaxa> i'm glad english is useful
<Sketchy_Sounds> And at least one thing I love about German is that for most things if you want to describe an object you just smash a whole load of words into each other
<klaxa> so i frequently use it
<Sketchy_Sounds> Like Luftkissenboot for hovercraft. XD
<FallSilently> I do plan to go back to it once I'm happy with my Polish.
<Donitz> mein hamster ist full of eels
<klaxa> Donaudampfschifffahrskapitänskajüte
<klaxa> i think that's the longest word described in the duden
<Sketchy_Sounds> What in God's name was that oO
<klaxa> the official german dictionary number one
<Sketchy_Sounds> What does that word mean XD
<klaxa> uh... hard to explain
<klaxa> so... um...
<Sketchy_Sounds> The ony thing I got out of it was fahr, for travel of some sort.
<FallSilently> I'm seeing squares.
<FallSilently> Mucking around with this Disqus thing could be causing that.
<klaxa> Donau is a river, dampfschiff is a ship that runs on steam, so a dampfschifffahrt is the process of traveling on a shit that runs on steam, and the kapitän is the captain (obvious) and the kajüte is the place where you sleep on a ship
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh, so it's the captain's sleeping quarters on a steam ship?
<FallSilently> How ruddy specific.
<SummerRain|WIFIissues> sooooooooooo
<klaxa> so in the end it describes the place the captain of a ship, that runs on steam and travels through the donau, sleeps
<mook> simply awesome
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's incredible XD
<klaxa> that's just ridiculous xD
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's almost as ludicrous as that one place name in Wales
<SummerRain|WIFIissues> whatcha wanna talk about, guys?
<mook> and i bet you can't look this up in a dictionary...
<klaxa> oh yeah i know what you mean :/
<klaxa> that's just... like seriously... why so long?
<FallSilently> Is the name "Aoife" common outside of Ireland?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Not really
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah
<FallSilently> Is it known?
<Sketchy_Sounds> That place in Wales is called Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
<klaxa> mook: you mean "Donaudamfschifffahrtskapitänskajüte" ?
<mook> klaxa, yes
<SummerRain|WIFIissues> I have been learning slowly how to draw ponies (FiM style)
<KataPhract> needs maor dark.
<klaxa> like i said i think it's the longest word described in the german dictionary
<klaxa> so you should be able to find it in there
<klaxa> wait i'll get it and look it up
<SummerRain|WIFIissues> Because i plan to draw myself..
<SummerRain|WIFIissues> that pony creator doesnt suit me as well
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ooh so you're gonna do it yourself Summer?
<Sketchy_Sounds> More drawing is good =)
<AnonPony44> Yes
<BananaBeard> Pppsshh.. That place name in wales is nothing
<AnonPony44> I wouldnt call myself the best artist around
<AnonPony44> usually i have to give up
<Sketchy_Sounds> As long as you're not the worst
<Sketchy_Sounds> And hey, don't give up
<BananaBeard> Here in new zealand, we have a place called Taumata­whakatangihanga­koauau­o­tamatea­turi­pukakapiki­maunga­horo­nuku­pokai­whenua­kitanatahu
<klaxa> oh apparently i was wrong... the word i mean was "Donau-Dampfschfifffahrsgesellschaft"
<Sketchy_Sounds> ....o___O @ Banana
<Sketchy_Sounds> What the hell
<AnonPony44> but i have learned that even though i am not very good at art, that if i wanna draw something so badly, and if i try hard, it turns out good
<Sketchy_Sounds> What does that even mean
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's good @ Summer
<Sketchy_Sounds> Also why are you suddenly Anon
<AnonPony44> Because thats my old user
<AnonPony44> and i dunno i had ping timeout on the other
<BananaBeard> I'm not sure if I'd be allowed to post the meaning of the name
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's dirty then
<BananaBeard> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu
<BananaBeard> see for yourself
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's not that bad
<Sketchy_Sounds> Not dirty at all
<Sketchy_Sounds> Unless I;m missing something.
<Sketchy_Sounds> **I'm
<FallSilently> You seem to be
<BananaBeard> you are
<Sketchy_Sounds> I really should switch to my desktop
<BananaBeard> its under "Other Variations"
<mook> ...damn
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> I see it now XD
<mook> also, dat sign
<BananaBeard> lulz
<Sketchy_Sounds> I've seen some really daft place names before as well
<Sketchy_Sounds> Random fact, Equestria is a real place
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's located somewhere in South Africa
<Flutterspy> Allo
<BlacklightShining> then why does Equestria redirect to My Little Pony on Wikipedia?
<Sketchy_Sounds> SPY!
<Flutterspy> 0.0
<Sketchy_Sounds> Because that's the more well known one
<AnonPony44> what the heck? what happened while i was in the other chatroom? XD
<FallSilently> That's not how Wikipedia works.

<FallSilently> It feels like it is... but the Detailed Stats page only covers the top 20.
<FallSilently> SO YOU MUST REACH FOR TOP 20
<Lunasta> The next goal after that is to get to the top 20 on the detailed

<Lunasta> Took ya long enough Seth
<klaxa> nice
<FallSilently> Interesting, Sketchy... are you certain you're awake now?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pretty certain
<BlacklightShining> top…top 1?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Which means I must have been dreaming of Pinkie
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...not sure what I should think of this.
<klaxa> i dreamt of rainbow dash yesterday night
<AnonPony44> I had a dream
<AnonPony44> it had Braeburn, Pinkiepie.. and i think Twilight..
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering the nick I apparently referenced was PinkamenaDianePie.
<klaxa> this night i dreamt of ponies too... somehow... but i can't remember any detail
<BlacklightShining> lucky you, klaxa
*BlacklightShining never dreams
<klaxa> :>
<klaxa> how come?
<Flutterspy> I wish I could have a pony dream...
<Fireant|AFK> BlacklightShining, not exactly true.
<BlacklightShining> ^
<Fireant|AFK> Everyone dreams, but not everyone remember dreams.
<klaxa> ever tried telling yourself "I will remember this dream tomorrow morning" right before you go to sleep?
<klaxa> because it really helps
<Espeon> 06Hi
<BlacklightShining> [pointer to Flutterspy's message] *
<Fireant|AFK> Its kind of a real mumbo jumbo klaxa.
<FallSilently> Aw, he's gone back to Blogger.
<BlacklightShining> wait, really?
<Fireant|AFK> Maybe he should dance a little and eat shrooms too.
<Flutterspy> that or lucid dream
<klaxa> Fireant|AFK: it helped me remembering my dreams
<Flutterspy> though if i cuold control my dreams they'd probably end up involving ponies anyway...
<BlacklightShining> ^
<BlacklightShining> hello JackiePie
<Fireant|AFK> Sure it does. Remember, there is a lot of people that believe in homeopathy!
<JackiePie> Hi
<klaxa> no i really tried
<klaxa> i wanted to start like a dreamjournal to learn lucid dreaming 'n stuff
<klaxa> so i told myself every time before i went to sleep that i will remember the dream
<klaxa> and i did
<Fireant|AFK> Awesome - do you design your dreams to be porny at least?
<klaxa> every time i told myself that
<BlacklightShining> inb4 JackiePie quits, client quit, no reason or ‘Quit: JackiePie’
<BlacklightShining> …DARN
<BlacklightShining> SO close
<klaxa> no i can't dream lucid ;_;

<Salad_Sandwich> And binary
<Espeon> 06Pretty much the same~
<Drake> 04Good to hear :3
<klaxa> i could count in hex too
<klaxa> and in binary
<klaxa> because it isn't really hard
<klaxa> after 0F comes 10
<Salad_Sandwich> Mmm
<klaxa> i mean was that so hard?
<klaxa> and 10 in hex is equvalent to 16 in decimal
<klaxa> also: it's not really hex, but hexadecimal
<klaxa> because hex would be the base of tem
<klaxa> *ten
<klaxa> which would mean that after 06 there comes 10
<klaxa> *base of six
<klaxa> wtf is wrong with my brain?
<Lunasta> 1 6 36 196 and I have no idea after that
<FallSilently> We've given up on that question.

<Lunasta> Hell yeah!
<Parchment_Scroll> "Brawny fans" is right, yeah!
<Parchment_Scroll> 'Course, they have the bronies mincing around in the animations.
<Dman> Ohai Rodman
<Dman> I muted it, viewing stuff right now
<Lunasta> Oh MLP:FiM, making men out of 4chan kiddies since 2010
<Parchment_Scroll> :D BIKER DASH!
<Salad_Sandwich> Oh god XD
<GGgala> hahaha oh wow, stream is still going?
<Lunasta> Internet High Quality - further proof that we're great! XD
<Dman> Yup
<Dman> al you seen 'friendhsip is magic bitch' ?
<GGgala> dari must be sleep-streaming
<Dman> eyup
<Lunasta> Counfound you Taiwanese newscasters, you drive us to be better than ever.
<GGgala> Dman: EEYUP. it even got streamed at least twice
<Dman> Hahahaha awesome
<Dman> I just woke up, so yah
<GGgala> Polarfire kept getting kicked... TO THE MOOOOOON
<Dman> went to bed early, finally slept more than 4 hours first tine in weeks
<Dman> feelsgoodpony
<Dman> oh dear, silly mods
<Salad_Sandwich> Brawnies XD
*Salad_Sandwich flexes
<Drake> 04G'night everyone
<User_6431> And then i died.
<Salad_Sandwich> Hurkbleh?
<Lunasta> Oh translator, that was supposed to be headquarters, but high quality works too.
<DesertRose> o.0
<DesertRose> hmm
<DesertRose> i hate it when a story your reading runs out of chapters
<Lunasta> What are you reading?
<DesertRose> past sins and fallout equestria
<DesertRose> now i have to wait for the next chapters
<Salad_Sandwich> I want more Progress myself
<Salad_Sandwich> That and Letters To And From A Princess
<Lunasta> Ah. Personally waiting for The Vinyl Scratch Tapes Season 2
<Parchment_Scroll> Want more Progress, FoE... I should finish reading Chapter 8 of My Little Western...
<Salad_Sandwich> Parchment_Scroll, did you see the drawing I finally did of my OC Sketchy Sounds?
<Rodman> How long has that song been playing?
<DesertRose> so many stories ive part read that havnt been updtaed in months or just dont update
<Parchment_Scroll> Nuh-uh.
<Dman> No idea
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Salad_Sandwich> My memory for these things isn't so good. OK, lemme rustle you up a link then.
<GGgala> hmm... probably for the last four hours?
<Salad_Sandwich> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png There he is!
<Parchment_Scroll> I sketched out Parchment and his bookstore last night. Now I'm making the bookstore in Inkscape.
<Dman> Dari just fell asleep with it on, did he?
<Dman> But i thought NewDCD was streaming?
<Parchment_Scroll> Tiiiiiight.
<Dman> Before I went off, DCD was streaming, so did Dari take over afterwards?
<Parchment_Scroll> Long legs, yeah.
<GGgala> at some point yep
<Rodman> Dunno
<Dman> I see
<Salad_Sandwich> Yep
<Rodman> Also
<Dman> yea?
<Salad_Sandwich> Well he's essentially an author surrogate of sorts
<GGgala> he streamed Friendship is Magic, Bitch and two episodes of Torchwood among other things
<Rodman> "Friendship is Magic Bitch" you say? Yeah, seen it
<Rodman> Trollestia!
<Dman> Hillarious
<Salad_Sandwich> So he had to be tall because iRL me is really tall too.
<Dman> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<DesertRose> i dont like inkscape
<Dman> But i had a sad :( Why Luna
<DesertRose> id much rather have a vector plugin for gimp
<Rodman> TO-THE-MOON-CANNON FTW!
<Salad_Sandwich> See I hate GIMP which is why I use Inkscape
<Dman> But luna :(
<Salad_Sandwich> That and I'm too cheap for Photoshop, don't want to pirate it, and hate how laggy Photoshop is anyway.
<Rodman> Poor Luna :(
<GGgala> she just came back from the moon@
<Parchment_Scroll> There's the pen tool in GIMP.
<DesertRose> same, but i would like inkscape allot more if its layers tool was more friendly
<Dman> Also, i guess it isn't really established, but I believe she has control over the Moon again
<Parchment_Scroll> You can set up vectors and then have GIMP trace them with a pencil or paintbrush.
<Dman> I NEED TO SEE HER in season 2
<GGgala> it's all pie in the sky until then though
<Salad_Sandwich> Whilst GIMP may have a pen tool, it's still got the problem of it being GIMP ;p
<Rodman> Wait
<Dman> what?
<Rodman> If Luna has control of the moon again
<GGgala> and really, Celestia's name would become obsolete if she didn't control the entire sky anymore
<Rodman> And Trollestia just sent her to the moon again
<Rodman> Floods, anyone?
<Dman> celestia - day sky. luna - night sky : D
<Dman> Hmm, Luna could flood the place, freeze the earth, make night eternal
<Dman> Celestia could ... make day eternal? Burn Equestria, bring about heatwaves
<Dman> :P
<Chimera> Anyone here? :|
<Rodman> Give them heatstrokes?
<Dman> lul
<Parchment_Scroll> I like Gimp. Still learning Inkscape.
<Salad_Sandwich> I tend to just use Inkscape for inking my lines currently, and then I just colour in SAI.
<Parchment_Scroll> SAI?
<Salad_Sandwich> Paint Tool SAI.
<MrPoniator> Sai is pretty cool
<GGgala> ok, brb. g2shower
<Salad_Sandwich> It's an excellent colouring program IMO
<MrPoniator> Though, I only use Flash and Photoshop so what do I know
<MrPoniator> And hardly draw to begin with
<Salad_Sandwich> It's got all the stuff I'd want from Photoshop, and none of the stuff I don't need.

<Rodman> Ok, need some help
<Dman> Hit me
<Insidious_Lars> Hai
<Rodman> I'm trying to get my best friend into the Herd
<Salad_Sandwich> Lol yeah
<Dman> Ah
<Salad_Sandwich> To be expected considering the cost
<Rodman> But he's reluctant to give FiM a chance
<Salad_Sandwich> That said, i think there are people that legally own Elements
<MrPoniator> Yeah, Adobe's pricing is ridicilous
<Dman> I see i see
<Insidious_Lars> Hai gaise
<Dermathil> Hey Everybrony
<Salad_Sandwich> seeing as it's quite stripped down and hence cheaper.
<Rodman> So, I was thinking
<Dman> http://i.imgur.com/hlaGL.jpg What's up bro!
<Dermathil> ohai Dmané
<MrPoniator> Yep
<Dermathil> *Dman.
<Dermathil> btw, pic fail
<Rodman> Bring him to the Stream this friday night
<Salad_Sandwich> Yah, I was sad when they acquired Syntrillium because it meant Cool Edit suddenly doubled in price when it became Audition.
<Dman> Do you not use chrome?
<Dermathil> nope, never.
<Dermathil> Firefoxé
<Dman> And Rodman - i've 'converted 3' and one was with this Stream
<Dermathil> *Firefox.
<AppleDash> Hello.
<Dman> Dermathil - y u
<User_4849> hi
<Chimera> Lul
<Rodman> Firefox is great :)
<Dermathil> the problem is Mibbit anyways, Dman.
<Dman> http://i.imgur[dot]com/hlaGL.jpg
<Chimera> Hi eXAKR
<Dman> http://i.imgur.com/hlaGL dot jpg
<MrPoniator> Also look what happened to Flash
<Rodman> But yeah, I'll try to bring him to this stream
<Insidious_Lars> Hai
<Dman> Good idea Rodman
<Dermathil> nice picture.
<MrPoniator> Not only did it get more expensive, but worse with every new edition since the times of Macromedia
<Insidious_Lars> What happened when I was away for about a day?
<MrPoniator> Although they did introduce ActionScript 3.0
<Dman> I'm on episode 2 - i began rewatching about 30 minutes ago
<Salad_Sandwich> To be fair, Flash actually got a bit better right after Adobe acquired it - but I think that was chiefly Macromedia's work.
<MrPoniator> But CS5? Oh god
<Dermathil> EPIC.
<Salad_Sandwich> I did notice though right around v9 of Flash that it suddenly didn't have huge lagging between frames
<MrPoniator> CS3 was alright, but CS4 and CS5 are quite something

<Ludovician> Wow, my computer really doesn't like EqD
<Ludovician> that trixie link crashed my browser

<Lunasta> NMAtv, the crazy Taiwanese 3D newsguys posted a vid about bronies
<MrPoniator> You spound Trixie right round etc
<Ludovician> I meant in the ponychat :p
<Lunasta> And the Nightly Roundup is up
<Parchment_Scroll> I'm checking it now, but it's got a few chapters</understatement> so I was hoping someone had read it. Ah well, it's starting off interestingly.
<MrPoniator> Ah, nothin'

<MrPoniator> Reposting
<Insidious_Lars> 3 ghosts ganbanged me
<FallSilently> He took down the spinning Trixie thingy
<MrPoniator> Probably so that the trixie wouldn't hog all the fame
<Ludovician> that was quick
<MrPoniator> Oh
<Ludovician> cmon there's so much trixie on this site lol
<MrPoniator> Okay
<SummerRain> I think Trixie is pretty
<MrPoniator> But I haz teh link
<SummerRain> but a little rude
<FallSilently> That Trixie thing was annoying as all heck.
<Ludovician> lol
<MrPoniator> Yeah, it was a bit hard to make out the lyrics
<Parchment_Scroll> Oh, I agree, FallSilently.
<AppleDash> Need to make a dash...
*Ludovician will award one magical internet pony to whoever says something amusing.
<FallSilently> Boobies

<Lunasta> This chat needs a TTS mode.
*Ludovician rejects your feeble attempts.
<Insidious_Lars> Hai
<FallSilently> A TTS mode?
<Ludovician> TTS?
<Lunasta> Everything is so much more funner with TTS
<Lunasta> Text to Speech
<FallSilently> Aha.
<Ludovician> lol
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Lunasta> Microsoft Sam-esque
<Ludovician> and then everyone would start typing at once
<Insidious_Lars> Still
<Ludovician> my ears!!!
<Salad_Sandwich> lolz
<Salad_Sandwich> That would be hilarious
<Salad_Sandwich> As would having ponies for Comic Chat
*Ludovician awards Lunasta a magical internet pony.

<Parchment_Scroll> Ludovician: It doesn't bug me that the impetus of the story is public fear of Celestia. It bugs me that the friggin' Element of Honesty can't tell when her best friend is being truthful with her.

<Ludovician> That's how I do my criticism if I have something to say. Why avoid saying it directly?
<Parchment_Scroll> "I gotta go, uh... harvest apples. 'Cause that's what we do. It's a apple farm."
<Ludovician> Are you referring to party of one?
<Salad_Sandwich> Hahaha ye

<stripes> g'day everypony
<Salad_Sandwich> That definitely made sense.
<Ludovician> the episode
<Ludovician> ?

<GGgala> g'day stripes
<L[a]korv> also Hawkie's, but ultimately mine.
<Insidious_Lars> Okay I'm stuck
<Ludovician> with what?
<Salad_Sandwich> I mean there's no way Pinkie would be anything other than Laughter
<Ludovician> Randomness?
<SummerRain> :P
<Insidious_Lars> Nope
<Salad_Sandwich> Same diff
<Insidious_Lars> In a GAME
<stripes> hello GGgala
<Lunasta> Exactly my thoughts Ludo :P
<stripes> hows you?
<GGgala> alright you
<MrPoniator> What kind of element of harmony would be randomness?
<Ludovician> I was gonna say something about Cupcakes, but... lets stick to canon
<stripes> not to bad thanks
<Ludovician> the random kind
<stripes> whats hapening here in these early hrs?
<MrPoniator> harmony... and randomness
<MrPoniator> Okay
<Salad_Sandwich> Fluttershy is the element of Moe
<Ludovician> moe?
<GGgala> perpetual ponyspin?
<Parchment_Scroll> Ooooh! I was just thinking about how Pinkie Pie's element and talent dovetail and make Pinkie Pie sense MAKE SENSE.
<MrPoniator> Definetely moe
<Lunasta> Randomness, the element that breaks the monotony of harmony?
<Ludovician> what u mean by moe
<Salad_Sandwich> Wikipedia is your friend
<Parchment_Scroll> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_%28slang%29
<stripes> wow
<GGgala> most bronies are asleep i think
<Parchment_Scroll> Literally, it means "burning."
<Ludovician> heh
*stripes grabs a camcorder
<Parchment_Scroll> Or "budding" or "blossoming."
<SummerRain> does anyone wanna rp in Bucket ofholding?
<SummerRain> :D
<Parchment_Scroll> To be more accurate, "moe moe" means burning.
<User_6654> Did that trixie post get deleted, or is it just me?
<Ludovician> but yea i agree on fluttershy
<Ludovician> I think it did, User_6654
<User_6654> kk, thanks
<eXAKR> Chimera: tried Googling it?
<eXAKR> Seems like there could be a physical cause
<Parchment_Scroll> Anyway, Lauren Faust has said that Earth Ponies DO have magic. It's just subtle, earth-based magic. Connection with the land sort of shit.
<Ludovician> so uhh.. last couple of nights I've kinda wished my cat was Fluttershy when she curls up next to me... is that normal?
<Rodman> And the streamer fell asleep with the computer on, apparently
<MrPoniator> I guess?
<GGgala> i suspect he did that on purpose, considering what's on
<Parchment_Scroll> Ludovician: No, but it's not run see a psychologist abnormal. Within normal bounds-ish?
<Ludovician> im confused parch
<Parchment_Scroll> Nobody's actually NORMAL. Normal is a mathematical term.
<stripes> hehe
<MrPoniator> Didn't quite follor that
<Rodman> Trufax
<eXAKR> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy
<MrPoniator> Or, the way you put it sounded off
<stripes> hello Rodman
<Parchment_Scroll> It's not normal in that it's uncommon. It's not abnormal in that it's not something to worry about.
<Parchment_Scroll> That better?
<GGgala> ooh what's the cam for stripes?
<Ludovician> yea
<Ludovician> :p
<MrPoniator> That's better
<Lunasta> Yes. Symptoms of being a brony include (but are not limited to): seeing ponies, wishing ponies were real, dreaming you are in Equestria, and many hours logged on Equestria Daily and/or Ponychan
<GGgala> or wait was that sarcastic
<stripes> recording the perpetual spin :)
<Chimera> That's not it
<Ludovician> Worth it...
<MrPoniator> I have all symptons
<Chimera> Here eXAKR, you try this
<Parchment_Scroll> I only have one of those symptoms.
<MrPoniator> Three months back, I wouldn't be the same
<Parchment_Scroll> :(
<Chimera> I lay down, right?
<Ludovician> Which one?
<GGgala> ah heh
<Parchment_Scroll> Well, what am I doing right now? ;)
<Chimera> I close my eyes tight and focus on nothing but my eyelids
<Ludovician> seeing ponies?
<Chimera> I start seeing swirls
<Parchment_Scroll> ...being logged into Equestria Daily.
<Chimera> My body thus starts vibrating
<MrPoniator> If I hadn't watched MLP, I would probably be chatting elsewhere and play games
<Dermathil> WE NEED STUFF ON THE SCREEN
<Chimera> And my heartrate goes up (probably in fear)
<Parchment_Scroll> If I hadn't watched MLP, I... would probably have quit my job the other day.
<Ludovician> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyC2ccF_-Pc
<Dermathil> QUICK, SPAM CHAT WITH RANDOM VIDEOS
<Parchment_Scroll> Ponies saved me.
<GGgala> he could've at least left it focused on the counter!
<Ludovician> add #t=15s to the end actually
<MrPoniator> Also, my summerjob would've been pretty boring
<Ludovician> indeed
<MrPoniator> Since I wouldn't have anything to look forward to when I'd get home
<stripes> hehe
<Dermathil> >mfw SPIN SPIN SPIN
<Parchment_Scroll> Good gravy, what does it say about me that I was able to identify that tune?
<MrPoniator> Since I watched the show, and after I was done with it I spent time on ponychan
<Lunasta> Other known side effects are: engagement in pony-based visual and auditory artistry, pretending to be a pony, and creating a pony avatar
<Ludovician> only that ur a brony
<MrPoniator> So yeah, made the job more bearable
<Parchment_Scroll> Okay, I've got those symptoms, too.
<^Spitfire> leader
<MrPoniator> Lunasta, I only lack "pretending to be a pony" part
<Ludovician> wait which tune is that again? WWU?
<Parchment_Scroll> I would never have done so if it weren't for the brony phenomenon.
<Parchment_Scroll> Yup.
<Insidious_Lars> Damn
<MrPoniator> Seeing how I've spent a week on some silly ponymation already
<Ludovician> can i see it?
<MrPoniator> (and yes, ponymation needs to be a word)
<Parchment_Scroll> Gah, I'm working on an AGS game.
<Rodman> AHEM!
<Dermathil> Only when the spin counter will reach a million spins shall Dari the streamer come back from his restful sleep.
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo
<Dragoran> heya Skylands
<Ludovician> To make pony-anything a word, just say it enough in public places
<Dermathil> OH NO
<Parchment_Scroll> Need to finish making Parch's bookstore for the dang thing.
<Ludovician> It will become one
<Dermathil> NONONONONO
<Ascendant> heya Skylands
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
<Dermathil> FORCED MEME IS FORCED
<Skylands> 10hi
<Dermathil> AND IS OVERDONE.
<Ascendant> :p
<MrPoniator> Or make Seth use it on the blog
<Rodman> :(
<MrPoniator> It's bound to stick, then
<Dermathil> seriously it has lost its fun now.<
<Lunasta> Like socks!
<Parchment_Scroll> And I refuse to use screengrabs, so I'll need to remake the common Ponyville location.
<Parchment_Scroll> WTF is up with socks, anyway?

<Rodman> This piece of madness then
<MrPoniator> You'll see it when it's done
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Xa4bHcJu8&feature=channel_video_title
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Ludovician> opening for what?
<Ludovician> so i can build anticipation
<eXAKR> Could also be something spiritual
<L[a]korv> could be anything.
<eXAKR> You believe in those sort of things Chimera?
<MrPoniator> I'll rather have it as a "surprise", even though it's not that special
<Ludovician> aw k
<Ludovician> u should ponify the opening trailer for an assassin's creed game
<MrPoniator> :P
<Ludovician> I would but idk how
<MrPoniator> Oh well, gotta take the dog out for a walk ->
<Ludovician> Sucks not having any artistic talent or knowledge of how to draw/animate stuff.
<Ludovician> cya
<stripes> hehe
<Lunasta> Ditto, but I seem to have a knack for writing lyrics
<PinkiePartyTime> PONINATOR IS GONE, PARTY!

<Parchment_Scroll> Thanks!
<Ludovician> speaking of nicotine
<Dermathil> Want a list of all the awesome moments in Gurren Lagann and all the funny, heartwarming and tearjerker moments?
<PinkiePancake> hi everypony :D
<Ludovician> some 13yo girl came up to me today asking for a cigarette O.o
<Lunasta> Heyo Pinkie
<Parchment_Scroll> O_o
<Ludovician> hey pinkie
<Parchment_Scroll> You told her not a chance in hell, right?

<Parchment_Scroll> I need Pinkie Pie's waffle iron.
<Ludovician> ?
<PinkiePancake> you smoke?
*Dermathil starts to play Sorairo Days
<Lunasta> Waffle iron?
<Lunasta> How are you gonna break a habit with that?
<Dman> LOOOOOOOL Just saw my cat cough up a hairball
<Parchment_Scroll> Reference to a fanfic, in which Pinkie Pie makes a time machine out of a waffle iron and other random things and goes back in time.
<Parchment_Scroll> It's sweet and silly despite having grimdark moments.
<Ludovician> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7BSgWG6Kw
<Parchment_Scroll> IIRC, it's called "Happy Birthday, Princess"
<Dman> Wanttobuy list
<Lunasta> I see.

<Lunasta> Heyo Balloons and Melody
<Parchment_Scroll> Nope.
<Balloons> Hey

<Insidious_Lars> I don't
<Dman> Dat Viral first appearance. NIKOPOL

<Dermathil> yeah

<L[a]korv> here, have the WSJ'11 song instead.
<Rodman> Same here, gimme this list of greatness!
<Dman> inb4 the list is a full transcript of the whole show XD
<MrPoniator> I r back, since it started raining and had to cut off the walk
<Rodman> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<Lunasta> Rain, oh I wish you were here in So Cal...
<Lunasta> But Sunshine is goo too
<Lunasta> good*
<Lunasta> Then I can go swimming!
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<MrPoniator> Welp, I'm a barbaric Finn so what do I understand about sunshine?
<MrPoniator> I prefer winters
<SummerRain> ..
*Dman is copying deadspaceextraction across.
<Dman> Wonder if it'll be good
<MrPoniator> :V
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Lunasta> I've only been in snow once in my life.
<Dman> cue NIKOPOL again :P
<Insidious_Lars> Never had snow
*Octavia loves now, does not like commuting in snow.
<Octavia> snow.
<MrPoniator> For me it's simply that downhill skiing and cross country skiing is the only outdoor activity I like
<Insidious_Lars> testing /me tenting
<Insidious_Lars> Okay it doesn't work that way
*FallSilently loves snow, what we get of it here at least, even the commuting bit
<RobotPinkie> 'sup neighas
<Dman> Sup Robotpinkie!
<RobotPinkie> ohai Dman!
*MrPoniator doesn't mind snow at all, seeing how quickly they get rid of it from the streets
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<MrPoniator> Sniffedy sniff?
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Insidious_Lars> Having myself a cold
<MrPoniator> Ah, that sucks
*Insidious_Lars sigh
<Dermathil> hey we need to make NewDCD stream Dai-Guard soonish.
<Insidious_Lars> Needa finish myself mother 3 as fast as I can
<Dman> Sure do
<Insidious_Lars> Prime numbers
<Salad_Sandwich> ...you have snow, Octavia?
<Dman> I'm going out, again, this afternoon
<Dermathil> alright
<RobotPinkie> Why Dai-Guard?
<Dman> "WE'RE GONNA COMBINE"
<Octavia> how else can i join in the winter wrap-up?
<Dman> Dermathil have you seen DaiGuard yoursef?
<Dman> I haven't seen it
<RobotPinkie> I've missed some important conversations, I feel.
<Insidious_Lars> I don't HAVE snow :(
<Dermathil> Dai-Guard is flipping awesome in SRW-Z2 and NewDCD has it on his computer yet never watched it yet
<Insidious_Lars> No winter wrap up
<Dman> he mentioned this :P
<Octavia> as far as the real world goes, there is a lot of snow where i am in janurary
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, well that's a fairly good reason, I guess
<Dermathil> so yeah, Seeing how the robot is awesome in SRW-Z2 makes me think we ought to see the anime soon
<FallSilently> Just January? Where's that?
<Dman> RobotPinkie - you're one of us! doesn't matter what you did and didn't miss!
<RobotPinkie> Oh right, that's true, the herd mind
<Insidious_Lars> Equestria silly!
<Octavia> well, two years ago it started in early december and went to march
<RobotPinkie> I think I must've encountered some socket error. :P
<Insidious_Lars> Or is it?
<FallSilently> We never get a "lot" of snow, ever, but December and January is when it happens.
<FallSilently> Occasionally February, I think.
<Octavia> was so bad this past janurary we were snowed in and could not leave for 4 days
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
<Octavia> ugh, i can not type right
<Insidious_Lars> Sniff
*Octavia needs her tummy to stop being nauseous.
<Insidious_Lars> Well you don't have the chillies
<FallSilently> Lot of sick people in here....
<Octavia> ehh, just exhaustion
<FallSilently> ...Hope it's not contagious.
<RobotPinkie> Definitely wouldn't mind a Dai Guard marathon
<Insidious_Lars> Heh
<Octavia> waiting for my breakfast to settle down
<Dman> Of Course
<Insidious_Lars> Never heard of a sickness that can be spreaded in the internet
<FallSilently> Breakfast... snow in January... middle of the Atlantic!
<RobotPinkie> but then on the other hand, there's a ton of other mecha animes I wouldn't mind....
<Dermathil> yeah
<Insidious_Lars> Yay
<Dermathil> so many things, I ought to see whether they are good
<Insidious_Lars> Play me off Fluttershy
<Octavia> im currently sitting in oklahoma
<Insidious_Lars> Malaysia
<FallSilently> I was close.
<Lunasta> Breakky... I guess I can find some
<Insidious_Lars> Or as easy as it can be
<Insidious_Lars> Asia
<FallSilently> I think. I have no idea where in the States Oklahoma is.
<Dman> It's a long life, and there's a lot to see and do. Let's see and do.
<Rodman> And as I've said, if NewDCD decides to stream Skies of Arcadia gameplay, I'm all onboard
<RobotPinkie> Indeed!
<FallSilently> I could check a map, but beh.
<JeffMangum> guys i need your help
<RobotPinkie> It's been a long time since I played that
<Insidious_Lars> O hai
<FallSilently> Absolutely.
<JeffMangum> why synchtube gives me 502 wrong gateway message?:((
<Insidious_Lars> Refresh
<Insidious_Lars> Or probably its down
<Lunasta> It's above Texas
<Insidious_Lars> Check back later
<Lunasta> which is in the bottom middle of the US
<JeffMangum> i mean synchtube.com works but synchtube.com/r/filly doesnt
<RobotPinkie> lol I assume you've already seen the NMAtv thing?
<Insidious_Lars> yep
<FallSilently> Funny, I always had this idea that Octavia was Russian. Wonder where I got that idea from.
<Insidious_Lars> Maybe its down
<Dman> Yup
<Z767> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

<Parchment_Scroll> Sorry. I is reading.
<FallSilently> I'm up to shenanigens elsewhere.
*Dman is trying out Dead Space Extraction
<Dman> :D
<Lunasta> I'm hungry, gonna forage for breakfast.
*Octavia strums her strings quietly. ♫♫♫
*Salad_Sandwich wanders over and parks herself near to Octavia to listen.
<stripes> mmm..interesting, thanks for the link Dman and prince-dari
*Ludovician takes a bit out of Salad_Sandwich.
*Salad_Sandwich screams in pain
<Ludovician> ^fail emote
<Ludovician> bite
*Salad_Sandwich bucks you in the face
*Ludovician uses unicorn magic to remove your front hooves.
<Ludovician> maybe back hooves would've been a better idea
*Parchment_Scroll conjures illusions to suit Octavia's music without really realizing he's doing it.
*Salad_Sandwich stops you with her own unicorn magic
*Ludovician notices the paradox in Parchment_Scroll's emote.
*Salad_Sandwich hmphs and sits back down. "No biting!"
<Ascendant> goodnight
*Ludovician thinks you look so tasty....
<Dman> Lol. Stripes - Prince-dari is one of our mods, and he also does 'scripts' which do...stuff. One of them is that his name will automatically give descriptions of youtube vids posted
<Dragoran> goodnight
<Parchment_Scroll> (what, did Octavia logout or stop?)
<Dman> He's asleep right now methinks. He may be away though.
<Salad_Sandwich> I actually do have a pic of Salad now, albeit not one I drew.
<Salad_Sandwich> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/salad.png
<Parchment_Scroll> Heh, that's from the game.
<Salad_Sandwich> Yep
*Octavia plucks lazily, ♩ ♪♪ ♩ ♩ ♫ ♬♬♬ ♫ ♪

<Beatline> Derpy? I love your timing
<Beatline> xD
<klaxa> altough it's already afternoon here
<Octavia> morning, Beatline
<MrPoniator> Almost evening here
<Beatline> Well, it's morning here. 9.9
<Beatline> And overcast as hell.
<Beatline> Again.
<Balloons> !
<Parchment_Scroll> Here as well.
<Parchment_Scroll> Not all that overcast, tho.
<Beatline> Might have another day of rainy marching coming up, but there's plenty of thunder...
<Octavia> ugh, dreadful
<Beatline> Quite.
<Parchment_Scroll> I presume by your name that you mean marching in a band?
<Beatline> Yes.
<Beatline> Well...
<Beatline> Not by my name xD
<Beatline> My name's an OC, and actually an electrically-centered doctor (heartbeat, pulse line).
*Torrent yawns
<Flutterspy> *derps*
<Beatline> But I am in marching band, yes.
<Flutterspy> oh, other bandgeeks?
*Beatline sticks another marshmallow in Torrent's mouth as she yawns
<Parchment_Scroll> Heh.
*Torrent noms it this time
<Parchment_Scroll> Just coincidence then.
<Torrent> stop doing that
<Ludovician> ill take em
*Ludovician steals a marshmallow.
<Octavia> What do you play, Beatline. I never asked.
<Octavia> Which is strange for me
<Beatline> Trombone.
<Beatline> In marching, at least.
*Octavia smiles, "Oooh. Hearty. Love it."
<Parchment_Scroll> Oh, so you play something else as well?
<Beatline> I'm pretty good with all low brass, though trombone's my main instrument.
<Flutterspy> nice, i play euphonium
<Parchment_Scroll> Ah. I'm more of a string colt myself, but it's been... years.
<eXAKR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-oxLOZBhk&feature=player_embedded <- How did the Taiwanese became aware of this? Oo
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: My Little Pony attracts Brony fans | by NMAWorldEdition | Length: | Views: 305
<Parchment_Scroll> *cough*decades*cough*
<Torrent> i haven't touched a instrument in my life, i produce electronic and stuff... if i ever do
<Beatline> Also got piano and a tiny bit of trumpet, and have recently found myself self-teaching myself the guitar and cello...
<Salad_Sandwich> Beatline: Can you play Rufus's Welcome from FFVII?
<Nuclear> Hello everypony.....
<Torrent> Hello Nuclear
<Arcanine-Anni> hiii
<FallSilently> Hello.
<Flutterspy> Hi
*Ray yawns
<Arcanine-Anni> ello'
<Beatline> I could learn it, but I'm not much of a FF fan, myself.
<Touridor> WE LIVE TO CONTROL.
<Touridor> hi guys.
<Parchment_Scroll> Whaaaaaat?!
*Ludovician throws a copy of Final Fantasy VII at Beatline.
*Beatline catches it
<Octavia> my brother in law is learning an ocarina. it makes me giggle when i hear zelda songs.
<Beatline> I like FF just fine, I just haven't played much of the games xP
<klaxa> i play them with the flute *shrug*
<Beatline> To clarify, I mean
<Ludovician> Did you mean this, salad? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-fleXlIRbs
<Beatline> I've always wanted an ocarina, but I settle for playing it on other instruments.
<Salad_Sandwich> I have an ocarina :3
<Salad_Sandwich> Three in fact
<Salad_Sandwich> And yes I did
<Octavia> out of general comedy, im going to get my hands on a concertina
<Octavia> i want nothing more than to play jaunty pirate tunes
<Torrent> they are the best!
<Ludovician> DO IT
<Salad_Sandwich> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiutkHNiacE Though I prefer this version of the song
<Nuclear> BETAMAX V.S. VHS
<Beatline> I only vaguely remember what a concertina is, could somepony kindly refresh my memory? xP
<Salad_Sandwich> It's like an accordion.
<Salad_Sandwich> Like the thing Weird Al is famous for playing.
<Octavia> betamax had better image quality
<Nuclear> lol
<Salad_Sandwich> BetaMax was technically superior
<Octavia> im old enough to remember them
*Torrent imagines someone playing a concertina on a pirate ship
<Octavia> im old enough to remember 8tracks.
<Salad_Sandwich> But it lost out to VHS due to greater cost and other factors.
<Salad_Sandwich> I'm old enough to remember tapes, but not 8 trakcs.
<Beatline> Ah, yes, I remember now
<Nuclear> I will get one Betamax player one day just for the nostalgic value...
<Dman> Hey there, Sathi
<Parchment_Scroll> I'm older than Salad!
<Parchment_Scroll> Wait.
<Parchment_Scroll> That's... that's not something to celebrate.
<Sathi> hey hey
<Salad_Sandwich> Are you? I was born in 84.
<Parchment_Scroll> Being older than people sucks.
<Parchment_Scroll> ...
<Nuclear> ?
<Parchment_Scroll> Gah, I am 10 years older than you.
<Salad_Sandwich> ...Baaaahahahaha!
*Salad_Sandwich does a fine rendition of Rainbow Dash's gigglefit
<Ludovician> Now I feel like a kid.
<Ludovician> thanks guys
<Parchment_Scroll> I'm a 36 year old married man who watches My Little Pony WHAT THE hELL IS WRONG WITH ME
<Dermathil> ohai Sathi
<Salad_Sandwich> Nothing
<Flutterspy> haha
<Torrent> I've seen worse
<Salad_Sandwich> MLP is just that awesome
<Beatline> ^
<Nuclear> Yeah!
*Octavia was born in the 70s. Haw.
<Sathi> hows life people?
<Ludovician> I know a 72 year old woman who plays WoW. that's worse.
<Parchment_Scroll> 12/31/74
<Torrent> A chopper door gunner in the US army who watches it
<Dman> Great
<Nuclear> YES
<Dman> I'm like 10 minutes into dead space wii, and it's really quite good
<Parchment_Scroll> Brony GUNNER.
<Parchment_Scroll> That is just all kinds of fucked up.
<Octavia> finally, someone a tad older than i am :)
<Beatline> There are older people who watched older cartoons and liked them, what's so wrong with it just being ponies? cP
<Octavia> welcome to the lonely top!
<Beatline> *xP
*Lunasta smacks Flash "Stupid embed"
<Parchment_Scroll> "Soldier, I order you to fire!" "But... Tolerance and Love, Sir!"

<Salad_Sandwich> LMFAO
<Flutterspy> lol
<Lunasta> What in the?
<Dman> Yes
<Ludovician> I loaded with gun with tolerance bullets. they're made of styrofoam.
*Beatline has a sneaking suspicion rehearsal is going to be cancelled, lightning is striking once every ten seconds or so
*Nuclear GASP
<Ludovician> Tell the pegasi to keep it away from your band
<Sathi> wuts that
<Beatline> Well, more like 10-30
<Dman> A videogame
<Octavia> good ole lightning capital.
<Dman> There's deadspace 1 and 2 for xbox
<Parchment_Scroll> No shit. Those instruments are electroconductive.
<Dman> and pc
<Beatline> Sadly, I don't know how to contact them.

<Ziltoid> well alright
<Dman> Ziltoid : quote: "House, i've head of you" "Yea, most have. most live in one."
<Lunasta> Chat can't be considered dead until 5 minutes after the last entry
<Dman> XD
*johnsey starts filling a pitcher with red bull and vokda
<Lunasta> That's the rule
<Nuclear> I see
<ZekeS> johnsey: ... wait what
<Ziltoid> wait really?
*johnsey passes it to ZekeS
<johnsey> chug it
<Dman> that's a qoute
<Ziltoid> man
<Ziltoid> nice
<Dman> House is a) a medical genius b) talented in so many things c) incredible at reading others (like holmes) and d) a total ass
<Nuclear> Oh heartburn
<Nuclear> POUR IT DOWN!
*Sathi nods
<Dman> He's also a bit of an idiot himself, some of the things he does :P
<Sathi> that pretty much explains why he's so awesome!
<Dman> yush
<Sathi> I love his dark humor
<Dman> "we gonna cure death?" "MUHUHUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. doubt it"
<Beatline> Wait. What
<Nuclear> ?
<Sathi> so yea what season shall I stream?
<Dman> As I told Dari, season 1 is brilliant
<Sathi> straight from dvd or should I download some?

*Shaico claps his hands.
<Dman> ...no?
<Ziltoid> I remeber they dint have it
<Shaico> Chat is so dead.
<MrPoniator> I kind of dropped Minecraft some months ago
<Ziltoid> or I think I think it was adblack plus
<Lunasta> NOPE.avi
<Sathi> 7http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpncxoo36Y1qincmao1_500.png
<MrPoniator> Before then I played it like all the time
<Dman> baw
<Lunasta> Chat is only dead if its over 5 minutes
<Sathi> 7fitting picture :P
<Ziltoid> I see it
<MrPoniator> Seeing how I've been out of school since March
<MrPoniator> And only had summerjob during July
<Beatline> I'm waiting until 1.8 to play MC again
<Ziltoid> do etttt
<MrPoniator> is that August or January?
<Dman> so what's gunna happen? Sathi testing now?
<Sathi> 7Ziltoid: just try chrome

<Beatline> Beta 1.8 of MC, yeah.
<Sathi> 7the D to the C to the D
<Lunasta> Aw
*Lunasta hugs back
<Ziltoid> A I B A
<Ziltoid> wat?
<MrPoniator> They're at 1.7 something now?
<Beatline> Yeah.
<Salad_Sandwich> 1.7 yeah
<Dman> ducudu
<Sathi> 7DCD dummies
<Dman> Dari - imagine the indian guy ordering eggs
<Beatline> There's gonna be lots more in 1.8 though, 1.7 was just pistons
<Ziltoid> oh
<Dman> funex?
<Ziltoid> Whats this funex business?
<Shaico> I still don't get how to use pistons.
<Dman> Let's do something fun gais
<MrPoniator> Mind giving a link to a list of what's it going to include?
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkWMcRlE1mQ
<Dman> This, Ziltoid
<Lunasta> Aren't the pistons supposed to be automatic block pushers?
<stripes> well im off to hit the hay, 'night everypony
<Dman> Let's do something fun, guys. Perhaps a multiway skype call?
<MrPoniator> I kind of stopped building stuff in Minecraft after I learned redstone stuff
<Sathi> 7nighty
<Barry> Hi Dari
<DesertRose> something like that
<Ziltoid> goodnight
<Dman> Goodnight Stripes
<Beatline> There's no complete list, and yes
<MrPoniator> Just wanted to play with different mechanics you can do with redstone dust after that
<Barry> Night Stripes
<Beatline> I'm only sorta okay with redstone.
<Shaico> Oh
<Shaico> I thought pistons were supposed to LAUNCH you in the air.
<DesertRose> i suck at redstone
<Shaico> Dammit.
<Ziltoid> L.O??
<DesertRose> well
<Lunasta> I'm amazed at what people can do with redstone
<Shaico> ^
<Dman> L.O. Ziltoid
<Shaico> Winter Wrap Up with note blocks.
<Beatline> I could do stuff with pistons, but... Creative block.
<prince-dari> Hey Barry.
<Lunasta> Working basic computers
<Beatline> I made a looping Parasprite Polka once
<prince-dari> Cya stripes.
<Ziltoid> im confused
<MrPoniator> First built a password protected door, then made it that it works with a timed button sequence instead of switches, then made a security alarm, then made it to play small themes when pressing buttons and oh god who knows what
<Beatline> That was fun.
<Beatline> Combination lock doors are easy with repeaters.
<Sathi> 7Whai confused?
<MrPoniator> Yeah
<Dman> Sathi - what FUNEX was. Already helped hin out ;)
<Ziltoid> that video
<MrPoniator> The one I made after the switches just works with buttons
<Sathi> 7cleaning keyboard... looks like the cat slept on top of it.
<Sathi> 7a9dajdmfafasfadf
<Dman> In ten seconds FLAT! :P
<Sathi> 7iudsexr43657
<Dman> lol. my keyboard is covered in hairs
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Dman> (cat)
<Ziltoid> silly cow
<Sathi> 7];L[PK0O90Y876E43AQwgfhjkl;'?
<MrPoniator> So after you press the first button, you have small amount of time to press the rest of the combination
<Dman> Just unclick off the chatbar sathi >_<
<Beatline> Ooh, sounds tricky
<Shaico> Wow.
<Sathi> 7I did but the fingerpointer still selects it :P
<MrPoniator> Yeah, took a hella lot of tries to get it to work
<Dman> lais
<Shaico> I don't even know how to open a door properly using a lever with redstone.
<Lunasta> Dammit, now I wanna play Minecraft
<Sathi> 7all done
<MrPoniator> And the best part: after I was done with it, not too long after the server I built it on crashed and so the map was lost :U
<Dman> Dari we gonna do something fun? or ...
<prince-dari> Sure, give a minute.
<prince-dari> Just doing something.
<Dman> Sure
<MrPoniator> Since I play only multiplayer
<prince-dari> I'll give you guys something for waiting.
<Beatline> Same.
<Sathi> 7More spins?
<Dman> most of us here have skype - we could sing? XD
<Beatline> Singleplayer has kinda lost it's luster to me, though 1.8 may change that.
<prince-dari> If you all want.
<DesertRose> the biggest flaw about making lockable doors is that unless the walls are made from obsidian, a person can just mine trhough it
<Octavia> i made a square wave generator using redstones
<MrPoniator> Also I made some harvesting system, that releases water so that it harvests wheat by a button press
<Dman> there's instrumentals of all ponee songs, and we could sing otha stuff 2. I could record it too XD
<Dman> ...if anybody wants
<MrPoniator> Instead of going over the whole field picking it up
<Dman> I mean, I hear RainBroDash wouldn't do it
<MrPoniator> Would've been easier to do with pistons, but I used some exploit some fellows had found
<Beatline> I do it by breaking a dirt block, but I stopped before pistons, so yeah.
<Lunasta> Redstone: the silicon of Minecraft ;)
<Beatline> Reeds?
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I know it could have been as easy as that
<MrPoniator> But I just wanted to make it fancy
<Octavia> i spent three days building an elaborate rail system that crossed over 4 biomes
<Unidentified39310> So... if a group of non-ponies from the equivalent of Tibet migrate to the equivalent of Japan and set up shop as an organized crime syndicate...
<Unidentified39310> What would you call that?
<Unidentified39310> *call them?
<MrPoniator> Ponyfia
<Sathi> 7currently a little busy
<DesertRose> Immigrants
<Dman> : / oki
<Nuclear> Silicon chips are so gooooood!
<Sathi> 7prepping for tonight
<Dman> yay
<Dman> I'm going out tonight, dunno when i'll be back, hopefully I don't miss all of it
<Betowolf> hey guys. long time no see
<DesertRose> sister is torrenting....must stop it
<Draco_Dei> MrPoniator: Well, I did say NON-Ponies... the Ponyfia would be their Italian-Equivalent, Pony Counterparts.
<Sathi> 7well if all goes well
<Sathi> 7i'll stream more often
<MrPoniator> Oh, yeah
<DesertRose> sucking up my internets
<Dman> yay~
<MrPoniator> Didn't notice the non
<Nuclear> TORRENT THE PONIES!
<Dman> meedeea faia
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> Hah, yours too DesertRose?
<Beatline> 9.9
<DesertRose> -.-'
<MrPoniator> My internet sucks
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> Oh really? Compare it to mine
<DesertRose> same
<MrPoniator> 14.95 MB download, but only 512KB/s upload
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> 1.2MbPS down
<MrPoniator> And since I need upload, a lot
<MrPoniator> It sucks
<DesertRose> 3.5Mb down 0.35 up
<Dman> *exhale*
<Octavia> beats mine to death
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> I have a sucky internet
<Octavia> 175Kb/35Kb
<Sathi> 7i'm thinking about getting a better monitor...
<MrPoniator> yeah, I know I probably don't have the right to complain so much
<Nuclear> Thankya DIAL UP
<Dman> What resolution is your current one / how better?
<Sathi> 7current one i use has a low resultion
<MrPoniator> But I really need more upload than I need download
<Sathi> 7as in real low
<Dman> as in what x what?
<Dermathil> what's tonight?
<Ziltoid> Mibbit y u crash?
*Octavia doesnt even have dialup, has to use her cellphone and has to stick it in the window to get 1 bar.
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> plus a sister who INSISTS on downloading 15 (redacted for cursing) GIGABYTES OF LUNA KNOWS WHAT MOVIES AND (redacted for indecency)
<Sathi> 7 1280x1024 lulz
<Dman> cuz is eh.
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Dman> >low
<Dman> >LOW
<DesertRose> for 3 weeks after a storm, untill my ISP fixed the line i was stuck at 0.05Mb down and 0.01Mb up
<Dman> >LOOOOOWWW !!!!
<Sathi> 7:D
<typjk> that's exactly my resolution
<Dman> That's not low at all!
<Draco_Dei> Ok, time is up...
<Dman> my laptop screen is lower!
<Ziltoid> Mine is also 1280x1024
<Sathi> 7my laptop is
<Nuclear> Download the whole internet with Verizon's FiOS's ULTIMATE CONNECTION!
<Sathi> 7 1920/1080
<Dman> my tv / 2nd monitor is 1920x1080, but 1280 is'nt low >_<
<typjk> i'm still stuck with my 2003 LCD
<Dman> ........0_________0
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> Ha, Verizon still hasn't come to my neighborhood and fixed the lines
<Draco_Dei> The would, of course, be called YAK-uza.
<Dman> ive never had a tv, just got one last year
<Nuclear> 150MPBS/35MPBS Now your playing with power, super power!
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> There's a voltage leak somewhere or something
<Ziltoid> really?
<Dman> so went with an LED 1080 :D
<MrPoniator> And also, my internet costs quite a lot
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> and it wreacks havoc on my ping
<MrPoniator> But there's only one provider for this small town
<Ziltoid> I still have an old ass 20" sd tv
<MrPoniator> So I'm stuck with this connection (the best they can provide here), as well as have to pay those greedy horseapples
<Dermathil> Meh, some big shot videogame magazines are throwing rumors around of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer Gear-of-war like
<Sathi> 7my second screen is like 4 years old now
<DesertRose> fortunately i can controll my entie local network, so i can disconect wireless devices remotely and block conections to the ethernet port.....because nobody else in my house understands anything about computers........
<Lunasta> Welp, I'm not gonna be playing anything online for a while
<MrPoniator> Heh, nice
<Octavia> i just QOS everyone except myself
<Dman> sure, if you can, get another 1080p one :D, but 1280x1024 isn't low >_<
<Lunasta> 1400 ping on the closest TF2 server... yeahno
<Ziltoid> ugh really dermathil?
<Octavia> MY PRIORITY.
<typjk> i always use my hardware until it just dies
<RobotPinkie> w00t, got Cinelerra to import FiM properly!
<Dman> Mirror's Edge M.E. Best M.E. u mad
<DesertRose> same
<Dman> trolol
<Lunasta> Hey DesertRose, how do you block people from the ethernet ports?
<MrPoniator> But since I'm moving away from home to a student home or so maybe in a year or so, yeah
<DesertRose> put tape over the copper parts
<MrPoniator> :D
<Sathi> 7@dman
<DesertRose> works like a charm
<Dman> Yes?
<RobotPinkie> Agreed, but only because of the time trial maps.
<Sathi> 7we still need to finish that portal section sometime
<Lunasta> Ha
<MrPoniator> I'd just have to login to my router and block their IPs
<Dermathil> yeah Ziltoid.
<Dermathil> Rumors of Co-op also.
<Lunasta> Sorry, but my sister is a little more advanced then that
<Dman> Sure do. I'd like to try again. L4D2, though, still runs at 5-10FPS
<Dermathil> UK Xbox mag
<Dermathil> and CVG
<Sathi> 7autsj...
<Dman> autsj?
<Lunasta> I tried MAC address locking
<Sathi> 7 5-10 fps
<Dermathil> ARE YOU FLIPPING KIDDING ME?!
<Lunasta> but my router only gives me the WiFi locks
<Dman> ...I said it in game like every 5 mins
<Dermathil> NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE LONDON RIOTS ARE CAUSED BY VIDEOGAMES?!
<DesertRose> you could activate the parental controlls of your router abd block said device...but that usualy tells them that their blocked
<Dermathil> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP
<prince-dari> Lol.
<typjk> everything evil comes from videogames
<Sathi> 7I was planning to go to London
<Dermathil> oh, right. GTA. Again.

<Dman> SLASH FACE FLOOR
<Sathi> 7oh dear god
<RobotPinkie> Race riots in the US in the 60s? Caused by GTA.
<Lunasta> Netgear WGR614 v7
<RobotPinkie> Fact.
<DesertRose> ehh
<Barry> Uh-huh... right, Pinkie
<typjk> the media just wait until someone tells them about an evil game and they blame stuff on it until someone gives them a better example
<Dman> Dari what you busy with aniway?
<Dman> woot
<Barry> And I;m the king of Siam
<Dman> whatdothen
<Lunasta> Not mine, but my old router could barely reach my room
<MrPoniator> I need to get a better router
<RobotPinkie> I'm not actually making a serious claim, Barry. :P
<MrPoniator> My current buffalo doesn't support port forwarding very well
<Dermathil> yeah, they always do that.
<Dermathil> They did the same thing with comic books and movies when they were the new hsit
<RobotPinkie> Though I wouldn't be surprised if someone blamed it on movies.
<Barry> Hard to tell in writing
<typjk> and evil rock music
<Dman> I might set up some sorta livestream for spanish FiM episodes live :P
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, they did that back before games came around
<Barry> @evilmeter Rock Music
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Rock Music is 55% evil. (1379)
<Nuclear> THIS IS MADNESS!
<Dman> hahaha
<DesertRose> what you can also do is change the wireless passkey
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, they did it before movies, too.
<Dman> @Pony The best Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The best Pony is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
<RobotPinkie> Classical music has been blamed for all sorts of things, even.
<MrPoniator> Welp, I'm off to practise some BlazBlue
<Dman> Dari y u no get rid of wonderbolts and devide cakes yet?
<Barry> Today's best pony is the Wonderbolts

<Dermathil> srry, mic is broke
<Dman> doo eet gais
<Lunasta> I'm thinking of blocking her ports
<Barry> @Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Barry is 6R12A3I9N8B7O4W 11DASH
<Dman> aww dermathil :(

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Chikyuu no tame ni is 54% zettai_makenai. (1381)
<Dman> who here has working mics den?
<Dermathil> mic works, but the hearing part of the mic is broke.
<DesertRose> she conected wirelessly?
<Dermathil> (headset mic works but headset "listening" part is broke0
<Sathi> 7@Dari put something on :)
<Dman> as in the part that hears your voice?
<Barry> I have a working mic, but I'm not going to read aloud
<MrPoniator> http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb285/Kilappa/DSCN1560.jpg don't mind the derpiness. My camera derped at the time
<Dman> oh headset broken : /
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dman> dermathil - can't ya go into audio options and make sound come outta your pc?
<Nuclear> ITS BEATIFUL
<Dermathil> though strangely the Mic part of the headset is working
<Dermathil> Dman: I be using speakers
<Dman> ya
*Sathi 7hates IMVU...
<typjk> is synchtube still down for you too?
<RobotPinkie> Wait, is someone going to read clopfics over skype?
<Nuclear> *BEAUTIFUL!
<Sathi> 7Why did I ever install this piece of crap
<Lunasta> She's the only wired one in the house
<Dman> so plug in headset and set sound for speakers
<Dermathil> but the headset are broken but the mic on it works
<Dman> imvu IMVU is a 11+ 3D graphical instant messaging client developed by IMVU Inc. It hosts over 90.174 million registered users, and six million unique monthly visitors. It is in public beta, and has been available since April 2, 2004
<Dermathil> (already did that for a while Dman)
<Dman> Dermathil, then you can use your mic :D
<Lunasta> unless the router won't let someone in and we're too lazy to restart the router
<Sathi> 7tis crap
<Sathi> 7uninstalling it takes ages..
<Dermathil> yeah, but I got the lady that's cleaning the house right now
<Dman> k
<Lunasta> then we resort to the 100 or so foot long cable
<typjk> 90 billion registrations o0
<Dman> so what. are. we gonna do then? I ain't just gonna sit here >_<
<DesertRose> o.0
<Dman> billion. million.
<Dermathil> WTF
<typjk> oh thats a dot
<Dman> xD
<Dermathil> a 15yo snorted ritalin to stay awake during a gaming session
<Sathi> 7rofl
<Dermathil> he was sent to the hospital
<Dman> wat
<Dermathil> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112138-Kid-Snorts-Ritalin-to-Maintain-Marathon-Gaming-Session
<Sathi> 7not sure what to say.now
<typjk> dat günther
<Dman> should...should I be recording this...?
<Ziltoid> why is my chat so derp
<RobotPinkie> plz don't touch my tralala :(
<Dermathil> no, Dman.
<Dermathil> Don't.
<Ziltoid> yes dman
<Dermathil> That's the kind of stuff only #silvershipper can do.
<prince-dari> "i can't masturbate to this,﻿ to much girls, not enough Gunther" - top comment
<Dermathil> and even then
<Dman> ...i'm getting mixed messages here
<Dman> epic comment then
<Dman> hahahaha
<MrPoniator> The latency on that cable must be something
<Dman> so are we gonna sing? read a fanfic? chat? request vids? watch a show?
<Sathi> 7up to Dari untill I hijack the stream
<Ziltoid> tralalalalalala
<Dermathil> Dman, we be doing nothing.
<Dman> but but
<Dman> we could be doing stuff
<Dermathil> I'm currently baffled at the stupidity of some people.
<Lunasta> It's a desperation/laziness cable
<MrPoniator> I can figure
<Dman> "A man wouldn't just sit here and do nothing!" Dermathil
<Lunasta> Hardly anyone uses it, except for my mom
<Dman> (brother bear)
<Dermathil> Like the kids that snort ritalin since it is like a less powerful cocain.
<Lunasta> who thinks that her laptops won't connect to the WiFi
<typjk> and its cheaper
<Dermathil> >mfw I was given ritalin as medicine when I was a kid
<Dermathil> >mfw it acts just like coke
<Ziltoid> lol
<RobotPinkie> Does it?
<Dermathil> >mfw Coke mustn't be that bad if I took Ritalin at 5yo
<Dman> tis a psychostimulant
<Dermathil> (every morning)
<RobotPinkie> trololo
<typjk> Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a psychostimulant drug approved for treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and narcolepsy.
<Dman> soooo c'mon Dari let's do something
<DesertRose> hehe
<RobotPinkie> Well it contains amphetamine, or something, doesn't it?

<Sathi> 7but then windows is gonna cry
<RobotPinkie> Yes
<Nuclear> Synchtube?
<Dman> dari : http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/530103

<StephenCawking> and chat with them
<Dermathil> >yfw EA says they will beat MW3's sale

<Dermathil> exactly.
<Dman> A WHAAA
<Beatline> Synchtube plays youtube videos.
<StephenCawking> they're probably playing more ear-rape videos
<RobotPinkie> Of course they will, they'll buy 50 million copies themselves and dump them in the Mojave
<Dermathil> They want people to use Origin or to prevent the steam sales.
<Beatline> Nothing if Synchtube is down, Stephen
<Dman> ha
<Ziltoid> lol wut?
<Beatline> xP
<typjk> i heard origin deletes your account after 2 years of idling
<Dermathil> exactly
<Dermathil> total and utter BS
<Dermathil> oh, and I hope EA sells Mass Effect 3 on Steam.
<RobotPinkie> Wow, so you lose all games you've bought?
<Ray> 02Hiya beto~
<Dman> it's pretty low, is volume set to max?
<Dman> AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS
<Epi> Now I have to use my imagination to talk about ponies. It's tough.

<Dermathil> DARI, VOLUME HIGHER
<Epi> Remember that time when Rainbow Dash did a sonic rainboom. ... Yeah... that was great.
<Dman> that's better :D
<typjk> If you have not used your Entitlements or Account for twenty four (24) months or more and your Account has associated Entitlements, your Entitlements will expire and your Account may be cancelled for non-use.

<Dman> "Bye"
<Ray> 02sorry for wasting your time :P
<Glacymr> 12i have no idea how he gets behind there x-x

<drf-Droid> it's fine LOL
<Dman> how'd ya do it?
<Dman> I used teh LEEEEEROOOOOYYYYY JEEEEEEEENKIIIIIIINS method
<prince-dari> Ran straight through the level.
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Dman> XD
<Dman> eyup
<DesertRose> oohh
<DesertRose> havnt done my daily workout yet
<DesertRose> that i only do every other day
<Dman> spaida ma spaida ma
<prince-dari> Same as my method for breach & clear I think it wqas.
<prince-dari> was*
<Dman> breach and clear? I did that normally : /
<prince-dari> That was the only one I beat the IW time for.
<prince-dari> Ran straight through without shooting anyone
<prince-dari> Had noob tube ready
<drf-Droid> since when do you have a cat Glacymr LOL
<prince-dari> Fire it as soon as riot shielders appeared.
<Dman> then u get far enough and no more spawn ^_^

<Dman> ttfaf?
<MrPoniator> Pretty surely TCP
<Dman> ah
<Dman> gotit
<Dermathil> Through the fire and flaesm
<Dermathil> *flames
<Lunasta> Alright, taking out the TCP port that's connected to my sis's IP
<Dman> >_<
<Dman> >interpretational dance
<MrPoniator> Haha
<Sketchy_Sounds> Seeing as TCP is the more explicit protocol and does checks to make sure the data is both sent and received at both ends.
<Dermathil> CANNED HEAT
<Dermathil> I think
<Dman> lul
<prince-dari> Lol, rick rolled.
<RobotPinkie> Oh gawds
<Dman> Lag
<Dman> LOOOL
<RobotPinkie> DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOOON
<Xiagu|Alseep> Pretty sure that utorrent uses a random port
<Dman> acid
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Dermathil> LOL
<Xiagu|Alseep> Mine is currently on 14632, for example
<RobotPinkie> haha
*Lunasta has his fingers crossed as he hits the apply button
<Sketchy_Sounds> If you're behind a firewall you usually have to assign a specific port.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Unless you have port triggering.
<Lunasta> I can see which ports are active in the UPnP tab of routerlogin
<Dman> ok i have a request Dari: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/533001 Can you play this with commentary while you do so? (takes 5 10mins to complete)
<Lunasta> or at least I hope those are the right ones
<Dman> SHORYUKEN
<SummerRain> ohoh
<Lunasta> Time for a TF2 test
<Dman> Hey, look, Derpy was here

<Lakorv> fine with me :V
<Rodman> DAT DERPY POSTER!
<Dman> "Each evening many people from surrounding camps, or just passers-by would join us to watch ponies on the screen. We'd get visits from members of Karachan (polish 4chan clone), from a neighbor family with little children, from random punks not believing what they are watching and why are they liking it, rocker girls enchanted by magic, missing concerts to wat
<Dman> watch ponies, and all kinds of Woodstock's colorful folklore just stopping by to watch ponies with us. Thanks to fan translation, the language was not a problem. So at about 5-7 episodes a day, with 4 last ones supplemented by fan-made pieces "Night of the Pony" and "PONIES the Anthology" ending the show we managed to air the whole season over the few evening
<Dman> that's awesome
<RobotPinkie> wow, that sounds epic
<Dman> so a huge camping thing went down, and so many bronies were there
<Dman> i guess
<Rodman> That just sounds like a good time in the making

<Chimera> Spy kids was barely good in the first place
<drf-Droid> tell Henry Ford his name is spelled wrong
*drf-Droid runs

<Nick> but regardless I'm not saying video games are to blame, never will
<Nick> I love Zelda and you don't see me trying to walk off into fields to find temples

<Rodman> SHE DID IT!
<ValtheJean> dumb bitch
<Denied_Existence> I may have been wrong
<manearion> MIT EIN KLEINE KARTOFFEL UNT DAS WIENERSCHNITZEL!
<Aurora> Among them were a graphic designer, college students, a youth worker, a university graduate and a man signed up to join the army. Some gave non-London addresses. Eighteen were remanded in custody.
<Aurora> So far 563 people have been arrested and 105 charged in connection with violence in the capital.
<Blums> der After
<Rodman> But she's not dead

<drfsupercenter> 03if you scan for viruses
<Apokalipse> did she died?
<ValtheJean> wait...the robot isn't broken?

<drfsupercenter> 03I should take a screenshot of that
<drfsupercenter> 03sadly I don't have the keygen anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03as it removed it since it showed as having a virus :P
<manearion> Yes I know, that's about it...
<StephenCawking> I'm pretty sure 'kartoffel' is 'potato'
<Blums> not carot, potato
<drfsupercenter> 03plus why would I need a keygen for something I now legally own XD
<manearion> But isn't kartoffel potato?
<Blums> yeah its potato

<RobotPinkie> Except for this part, I completely understand what's going on here
<Pegacorn> GODDAMNIT HENTAI GTFO.
<BlacklightShining> Nightly Roundup 62 (from last night) ^
<Lakorv> sheesh.

<Apokalipse> Yeah. I do too even though I just started watching
<SillyNilly|YGOTAS> Squeeky toy noise, oh I can't handle it!
<BlacklightShining> Instant Rarity button? O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03$100 off holy crap
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, this is supposed to be about GIANT ROBOTS
<manearion> Also, Rainbow Dash is so many times cuter!'
<Rodman> GODDAMIT SRW OG!
<drfsupercenter> 03if I didn't already have Corel VideoStudio I'd so get it
<StephenCawking> hot pony lovin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYmZ0N2UZag
<Rodman> IF I WANTED TO WANK, I'D WATCH SOMETHING ELSE, NOT THE SHOW ABOUT GIANT ROBOTS!
<Denied_Existence> Suddenly I want to build a giant robot and blow up china...
<manearion> No hateing, just saying that since RD is so badass, her being cute is EXTRA cute!
<Apokalipse> yeah. They're giant alright...
<drfsupercenter> 03<Lakorv> sheesh. <- what was that comment at?
<Rodman> For the Ancient Chinese Mechs?
<NewDCD> 9well guys
<RobotPinkie> lol
<NewDCD> 9at least they have the decency to keep most of the tantalizing shit in the credits
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<RobotPinkie> That's true
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/memes-economy-update.jpg
<Denied_Existence> I HAVE THE URGE TO GO BLOW UP CHINA USING A GIANT ROBOT
<Rodman> Atleast
<NewDCD> 9unlike HSOTD
<Denied_Existence> WHY DO I HAVE THIS URGE!?
<Rodman> HSOTD was awesome but I agree, too much fanservice
<NewDCD> 9Existence: WHY YOUR URGE RELATE TO BLOWING UP CHINA AND NOT TO ENFORCING JUSTICE
<Lakorv> at keygens and general silliness.
<drfsupercenter> 03how is it general silliness?
<manearion> That video was... Disturbing...
<NewDCD> 9Rodman: I read the manga, cause the anime was too damn excessive
<Rodman> GO ENFORCE ENFORCER!
<drfsupercenter> 03Before I had a legal serial, I had to keygen it...
<NewDCD> 9at least it's easier to ignore in print
<Lakorv> did I say it was?
<Denied_Existence> BECAUSE ENFORCING DOESNT ALLOW YOU TO BLOW SHIT UP
<gilaga> It wud be much better with ponies ofc
<Rodman> Got a point there
<Soital> 12The trafford center is rioting now -w-
<Rodman> As for me
<Rodman> I'm leaving
<drfsupercenter> 03as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is *THE* best antivirus for Windows, no questions asked

<Soital> 12good god people.

<Pegacorn> Bye Rodman
<Soital> 12just said

<Nick> where did they read it?
<Denied_Existence> Yeah NewDCD, which side is the "Good" side?
<NewDCD> 9obviously NOT the DC
<NewDCD> 9albeith the thing is
<Apokalipse> I have no idea who the dc people are or the earth guys. GIANT ROBOTS FUCK YEAH
<BlacklightShining> oh
<BlacklightShining> right
<RobotPinkie> I'm not sure there is a good side
<NewDCD> 9the DC was more morally grey in the first game/season
<NewDCD> 9Bian Zoldark basically pulled a Lelouch
<Aurora> 6oh god my internet here fails
<Sketchy_Sounds> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<abirkin2> can someone link me to the just under 10 hour long vid of all the episodes?
<Sketchy_Sounds> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Sketchy_Sounds
<NewDCD> 9so they wiped out the DC and himself included, so the Earth Federation could be strong enough to fuck Alien shit up
<NewDCD> 9BECAUSE nobody believed him when he was like "GUYS ALIENS ARE GONNA COME FUCK OUR SHIT UP"
<Aurora> 6its gonna take liek 12 hours to install this game lol
<gilaga> fav MLP Episode?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 TF2
<Aurora> 6yep
<Soital> 12they're apprently around there o_o
<drfsupercenter> 03well at least you get 12 hours of sanity before that game
<Aurora> 6I wanted it on this computer but if that's the speed it's going to install at
<StephenCawking> I hate MLP I just come here for the community
<Denied_Existence> RobotPinkie No, but there is definitely a different shades of grey.
<ValtheJean> still, it seems like the only likeable/relatable characters are on the earth side
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's like asking me to pick a favourite limb.
<Aurora> 6then forget it
<Denied_Existence> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the spirit
*drfsupercenter hides
<gilaga> i agree sketchy
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
<Denied_Existence> EARTH, FUCK YEAH!
<BlacklightShining> ^
<ValtheJean> >mfw I say that as Pinkie unzips her suit
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how Amazon emails me letting me know that I "bought" free apps on the Amazon app store
<Aurora> 6you do know I already play the game, so I guess I'm already "insane" as you define it
*StephenCawking knows what his favorite limb is
<NewDCD> 9spoiler: most of the relatable characters in the DC side will join the party. I mean, this IS SRW after all
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like, why are you even letting me know if it's free
<Denied_Existence> Lolz
<Manearion> Cutest R-D! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVnu05eCX2U
<Blums> the thumb?
<The_Crowing> what is that dont even
<ValtheJean> good, so I can hate DC then and not feel like a biggot :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well you're clearly addicted to it, insane or not
<Aurora> 6addicted, no
<Aurora> 6or else I'd actually let this game install
<Aurora> 6and I'd be playing it nonstop
<Denied_Existence> I MUST SATISFY MY URGE TO BLOW SHIT UP
<abirkin2> anyonr?
<drfsupercenter> 03you basically do play it nonstop when you have it installed
<drfsupercenter> 03?:P
<drfsupercenter> 03-?
<Aurora> 6I play it alot because I actually enjoy playing against actual people
