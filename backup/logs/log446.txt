<CrimsonPhoenix> DISNEY***
<panda> Ninjazz: that show was like, the SHIT!
<Firaga> WHEN I AS A LD I ATE TWELVE DOZEN EGGS!
<Aurora> the front page isn't random, unless you set it to "newest"
<otakon> And then Gaston was Rainbow Dash
<BlueFlare> 02Nude isn’t supposed to be sexual, porn is
<Phase4> rainbow > gaston
<OctaviaIsBestPony> Wait wut
<Drake> 04"Nude" is fine if it'
<Ninjazz> panda: It was, in fact, rather awesome, yes. :D
<otakon> and it FITS DAMMIT!
<junh1024-XD> well, cleavage
<Aurora> in which case, it would be uploaded too fast for the filter people to remove it
<Gunthler> i liek Rainbow Dash :3
<Drake> it's not blatant "HEY LOOK I HAVE A <censored>"
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 13 time(s).
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean, @ newest
<Firaga> AND EVERY LAST INCH OF ME IS COVERED IN HAIR!!
<SparklyWaffles> .-.
<Drake> 04screw you Scriptbot
<Aurora> then don't put it on newest
<PWNIES> wait..
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> code lyoko is airing a 5th season this year
<otakon> SparklyWaffles: what's up?
<MahBoi777> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03even simpler is to not go to the site at all
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<PWNIES> I remember this song :I
<drfsupercenter> 03my point being
<Rain> win win win
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a ton of inapropriate stuff on there
<Aurora> any porn images that go through there are removed within hours
<SparklyWaffles> M-uh... The sky...?
<Sumica> 00,10this fits so well
<CrimsonPhoenix> PWNIES: Of course, it's in Beauty and the beast
<otakon> THIS FITS SO DAMN WELL!
<Aurora> honestly it's not that bad lol
<panda> DAT RD VOICE!
<MyLittleDashie> im the most stalked person at school
<Saturn> 08,01dat beauty and the beast
<otakon> Sumica: good editing
<Aurora> just like anywhere on the internet
<Ninjazz> It fits...
<PWNIES> ahahahah
<Aurora> just better
<Kosoveon> there's a ton of inappropriate stuff on any site that consists of user-created content, really
<panda> MyLittleDashie: you are?
<Rain> Sumica you should link this
<Drake> 04And the label "porn" is bent, screwed over and dodged at every opportunity
<MyLittleDashie> lol yea
<CrimsonPhoenix> also lip sync is horrible
<Kosoveon> it's hard to regulated everything
<otakon> XD
<Kosoveon> -d
<OctaviaIsBestPony> WUT?
<PWNIES> GASTON
<drfsupercenter> 03well, an art site is more prone to getting mature art than something else
<TheHoodyNinja> Gaston is a pussy
<MahBoi777> O_o
<junh1024-XD> defining porn vs art is a bit hard & gery area etcetc
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: it's not gonna be good, it's the action that fits and timing really
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Sumica: are u gonna stream new accel world after this?
<Drake> 04Namely in the region of "erotic literature"
<panda> CrimsonPhoenix: I make amv's and such... lip sync is REALLY HARD!!!!!!!!!
<Firaga> The Pony Beboop intro video is still one of my favorites
<Sumica> 00,10not this week
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know panda
<Gunthler> i really REALLY liek Rainbow Dash xD
<otakon> Expectorating=Spitting
<Vordox> "get large"....
<SparklyWaffles> o-o

<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Sumica: NO ACCEL WORLD! why not?
<TheHoodyNinja> barge? in midevil times?

<Sumica> 00,10cause I save them for fridays
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dinsey week?
<TheHoodyNinja> BULLSHIT!
<hen3ry> yes in the race episode

<otakon> Eddmario: ugh, the sequel
<drfsupercenter> 03LMAO that's actually fun to read :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eddmario: Sequel?
<BlueFlare> 02all I know is that some sites are even more prone to mature content. Like how some people try to turn FB into a real porn site
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm scared to ask for the summary
<SparklyWaffles> wait.... Rainbow Dash = Gaston?
<Aurora> 6ok so
<Eddmario> I like it. The giant organ played by Christopher Walken was fucking creepy as fuck though.
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Aurora> 6that's fun to read, yet you don't like the content on DA
<otakon> SparklyWaffles: kind of
<drfsupercenter> 03who tries to turn FB into a porn site

<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon: hold on
<BlueFlare> 02^
<Kosoveon> ^
<BlueFlare> 02pretty much
<drfsupercenter> 03regardless of what term we're calling it
<SparklyWaffles> Oooh, my head is pounding the second this song came on... xD

<TheHoodyNinja> that wasnt a swordfight
<Ninjazz> Daring Do!
<junh1024-XD> i waslked into a public art gallery last year right?
*BlueFlare hides
<Firaga> inb4 she was reading game of thrones
<mario_pony> hi Ninjazz.
<Saturn> 08,01panda: he is a solitary sailor
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon: http://i.imgur.com/DXpfB.png
<junh1024-XD> some topless girls, etc
<junh1024-XD> some are even on brochures/guides
<panda> CrimsonPhoenix: thats all you have?
<drfsupercenter> 03well, whether you can call it art or not, it's still considered inapropriate for everyday stuff... not saying I care or not etc
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah sadly
<panda> Saturn: hm... must be lonely :(
<Drake> 04which incites the "What the F*ck" reaction from me
<Phase4> XD
<Aurora> 6actually
<junh1024-XD> counted about 3/1
<Aurora> 6that's debatable
<Saturn> 08,01little mermaid > beauty and the beast
<TheHoodyNinja> That fast?
<Firaga> Till season 3!!!!
<Vordox> PHOTO FINISH!
<Gunthler> CrimsonPhoenix: Your name is Samuel :D
<Kosoveon> it depends on what you consider "inappropriate"
<drfsupercenter> 03most people consider female nudity as inapropriate LOL
<Phase4> Saturn: theres two movies i need to watch again
<CrimsonPhoenix> D
<panda> Saturn: but... disney movies=disney movies
<Aurora> 6:/
<SparklyWaffles> lol
<TheHoodyNinja> what Saturn said
<drfsupercenter> 03at least
<Saturn> 08,01panda: but some are rubbish
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's a boy looking at it
<Firaga> the adventurers hookers?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I do have Lion king and Fox and the hound on DVD :D
<BlueFlare> 02well yeah. they has been nude art ever since the man has existed
<Aurora> 6and this is the area where more artists have to sit awkwardly while people talk about naked people
<drfsupercenter> 03regardless of any artistic point
<panda> Saturn: when it comes to nostalgia, nothing is rubish :D
<Saturn> 08,01like that one about ancient egypt
<Saturn> 08,01
<Saturn> 08,01or moses
<Aurora> 6I see naked people every week :/
<BlueFlare> 02-the
<Gunthler> CrimsonPhoenix: Samuel :D
<Saturn> 08,01or something
<TheHoodyNinja> Shipping
<[web]JRP2234> sumica u have portal 2 right
<panda> Saturn: :/ hm... good point...
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Aurora> 6a lot of people think it's funny
<drfsupercenter> 03hey like I said, I'm not saying I mind... just that most people go "boys looking at naked girls, HMM"
<Kosoveon> nudity in art (in any medium), if used for a specific, meaningful purpose is not inappropriate
<Aurora> 6and we just...yeah. we don't see any difference really
<Firaga> oh man youtube poop have completely ruined this movie for me, actually scratch that they made them even better
<Aurora> 6uh
<drfsupercenter> 03yes but meaningful purpose isn't necessarily the same as "I'm going to just take pictures of naked girls"
<Aurora> 6again, define art
<Phase4> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean
<Phase4> twilight x rainbow
<otakon> and the Rainbow Dash x Twilight became canon
<Phase4> i've read that fic
<panda> is colgate a time traveler too?
<drfsupercenter> 03you can blanket almost anything under that term
<otakon> panda: no
<Aurora> 6yep
<junh1024-XD> true
<Firaga> inb4 beast is zecora
<Saturn> 08,01the songs in Beauty and the Beast are absolutely wonderful, though
<Aurora> 6until social taboo comes in
<Rain> ^
<panda> otakon: why does she have a thingy like dr whooves them
<otakon> Saturn: agreed
<drfsupercenter> 03just as how you could look up, say, how to build a bomb and say "oh, it's just education" when it could also be called terrorism?
<junh1024-XD> would you call black & white photos of supermarket notices art?
<Aurora> 6nudity is not exactly a social taboo
<Aurora> 6porn is
<CrimsonPhoenix> Name one Disney song that's bad
<Kosoveon> I use "art" as synonymous with "medium" when I made my statement
<otakon> panda: hourglass is a common cutie mark
<Kosoveon> as in
<Vordox> YAY!
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD THIA
<otakon> the hell?
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, bad example, I like extreme examples
<Gunthler> If Rainbow Dash ever gets cannon shipped I'll be one pissed off brony :|

*TheHoodyNinja looks at his finely toned buttox
<BlueFlare> 02no, it'll fly up into the sky
<somepony_else> give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
<Kosoveon> as a personal definition of art, I would define it as anything that engages me emotionally/intellectually, good or bad
*BlueFlare runs
<MahBoi777> Beer lawl
<Ninjazz> otakon: Scream!
<Kosoveon> that's when people talk about video games being art I'm like
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know some of my renard
<Vordox> IT was a meme before, that had ALOT of followers.
<Kosoveon> *why
<panda> otakon: reminds me of the things from amnesia :D
<drfsupercenter> 03there's lots of art IN video games
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I need to listen to more of his stuff
<Firaga> since we cant post youtube links ill just write the name of the best video of gaston out there, "Gaston pleasures himself to the sound of his own voice"
<Vordox> Okay, TOO much hair!
<otakon> panda: eeyup....
<[web]JRP2234> HAIR
<Aurora> 6video games are art
<drfsupercenter> 03but as I said it's a blanket term, you can just shove whatever you feel like and say "oh, yeah it's art"
<CrimsonPhoenix> especially since I got all the collection
<Aurora> 6everything about it is art
<[web]JRP2234> SOME MUCH
<BlueFlare> 02^
<drfsupercenter> 03just as how you can clang pans together and say it's music
<Kosoveon> art is different for each person, in terms of what the "art" in question is invoking in the person being subjected to it
<TheHoodyNinja> Lyra approves
<Kosoveon> well
<Kosoveon> "subjected" isn't the right word
<Vordox> So,,, anyone been haired lately? XD
<mario_pony> Firaga: wut...

<drfsupercenter> 03OK wow I am such a horrible person
<BlueFlare> 02vidoes games are also the hardest kind of art to make
<otakon> I am so confused atm
<Kosoveon> in the same way some people don't consider books to be art because they do not find books to be engaging or thought-provoking
<Fleur> Oh god this will be win
<drfsupercenter> 03I just blew up my pet wolf with TNT
<Phase4> whats this song
<mario_pony> DeathStar|sick: why u sick?

<Gunthler> lol Fleur whats it like to be a trophy pony? :D
<pinkiespice> anime~
<Aurora> 6video games start from a concept (art), need ideas (art), characters (art), background and layout (art), concept art (obvious), models and animations (art), gameplay (art)
<DeathStar|sick> mario_pony: I have a cold
<otakon> THE HELL IS THIS I MUST KNOW!
<MahBoi777> FABULOUS
<drfsupercenter> 03story (not art)

<panda> Fleur is best trophy wife :D
<drfsupercenter> 03let's just sum it up as "artists will call just about everything in life art" and be done with it
<TheHoodyNinja> 7
<Aurora> 6the art of storytelling is a creative process that needs to invoke emotion/thought/interest etc
<Kosoveon> story is a blanket term in of itself lol
<Fleur> not a wife~
<Shamroc> lol all the gropage...
<BlueFlare> 02and then you have games like Zelda that have a LOT of reading
<Ninjazz> Well, she is the only one, panda.
<Gunthler> Guys, I need to know what a trophy wife
<TheHoodyNinja> oh japan
<junh1024-XD> music, just like "art" doesn't have definable boundaries
<junh1024-XD> it's debateable

<otakon> dat FLCL
<MyLittleDashie> BUY ME MORE JEWELERRRYYYY

<drfsupercenter> 03music can be whatever LOL
<Vordox> WORST BLACK GU EVER VIDEO!
<Kosoveon> well, if for instance, I hear a song and think it sucks, I would consider that song to be art because it invoked disgust (an emotion) from within me

<CrimsonPhoenix> OHN O

<Vordox> Or Worst Black Voice actor XD

<Ninjazz> Too much Sumi...
<Ninjazz> Too much...
<Kosoveon> *o
<otakon> Ninjazz: NOT TOO MUCH!
<junh1024-XD> intresting thing is, in the news and such, they present intelligent design as a sensible, scientific, alternative to evolution for the readers to choose & decicde, but in reality it's not.
*Firaga tries to find his sides
<Phase4> i stopped laughing half way through simply because i could not laugh anymore
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Robert Fagot
<MahBoi777> WHOAH
<drfsupercenter> 03well what else pisses me off (as you can see in that episode), is that religious people will be like "You can't prove evolution so it's stupid", but... can they prove creationism?
<Ninjazz> otakon: He nealy killed us, man...
<[web]JRP2234> sumica just a secf
<panda> Sumica: i think everyone agrees that... nothing will beat that
<drfsupercenter> 03Tehy're just like "We don't need proof, it's religion"
<drfsupercenter> 03so why question science

*Ninjazz pats Midnight_Tempest on the back
<hen3ry> Name of guy? KFC
<CupcakeWarrior> So racist
<otakon> Kentucky Fried Chicken........A NAME?
<Kosoveon> as can I
<drfsupercenter> 03the more I learn about religion, the more I want nothing to do with it really
<BlueFlare> 02same Aurora
<Ninjazz> Dear lord... Dats Wacist.
<otakon> mfw it's 50
<Kosoveon> but as a religious person I would put that aside because I don't want to impose my beliefs on others
<Sumica> 00,10wth, why cut it off
<Midnight_Tempest> KFP... kentucky fried panda, its finger ling-ling good...
<otakon> Sumica: bc that was the funny bit
<drfsupercenter> 03it's funny though, we were learning in my humanities class that the church would actually hire scientists to do research for them
<TheHoodyNinja> okay, even ninjas need sleep, night everybody
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ooooooh there's a good one in there
<[web]JRP2234> where did he get kfc from
<Aurora> 6I used to be super religious, was about to be baptized, got a bit of a slap to my face by my dad
<Aurora> 6and now I actually see the point in everything
<hen3ry> no idea
<Firaga> good night TheHoodyninja
<Irres> I distance myself from both because it's not worth worrying over
<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't until the scientists started proving the church was wrong that they hated science LOL
<otakon> Sumica: do you have the Jeopardy skits from SNL?
<DeathStar|sick> did you all die of laughter or is my chat derping?
<[web]JRP2234> sumica
<Sumica> 00,10filmed with a potato
<Ninjazz> Night TheHoodyNinja! Sleep well.
<Aurora> 6organized religion is just as dangerous as a kid with a gun :|
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<CupcakeWarrior> Potato is best camera
<Kosoveon> inb4 Galileo and the heliocentric theory
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sorta the reverse I guess, as I was baptized as a Catholic and expected to follow it

<twilight_sprinkler> oh man this is awesome
<otakon> SEAN CONNERY!
<Kosoveon> I have nothing against religious people or anything
<pony_9800> xD
<Aurora> 6I go to church with my family for easter and christmas only if I'm with my dad
<Kosoveon> but it's not for me
<Ninjazz> You spin me right round.
<Aurora> 6cuz they always go for those two
<Vordox> SNL XD
<drfsupercenter> 03what I have against most religious people is the fact that they won't accept that someone ISN'T
<twilight_sprinkler> although the cut up is kinda meh
<panda> :D
<Aurora> 6and I'm afraid that if I don't go, they'll call me out for when I used to be super religious
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm fine with the whole
<twilight_sprinkler> the actual footage is great
<Aurora> 6which wasn't that long ago actually
<Phase4> an album cover
<otakon> You win the day, Trebek.
<Phase4> an al bum cover
<Irres> My family is similar - they don't reallh care
<Aurora> 6see
<otakon> I'll have the Penis Mightier for 1000
<drfsupercenter> 03"I don't care what you believe in, I won't try to push my beliefs onto you"
<Firaga> Rare footage of will ferrel being funny
<Shamroc> dat hat
*DeathStar|sick dances
<Irres> really*
<drfsupercenter> 03but how often does that happen? Not very often from experience :/
<Aurora> 6I know a lot of people who accept them for whatever, they keep their faith while tolerating people as people
<otakon> That's Pen Is Mightier
<Aurora> 6but then there's people like westboro
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<otakon> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03>Jehova's witnesses
<Ninjazz> So... Much... Potato quality.
<Sumica> 00,10so many fail versions
<Mutterguy> DeathStar|sick don't dance. you're sick :(
<Onyxia> wat was dat
<otakon> Sumica: yh, I know man

<otakon> and once again, FILMED ON POTATO!
<DeathStar|sick> Mutterguy: but I like to dance
<otakon> XD
<twilight_sprinkler> Firaga: there are no other versions
<Gunthler> I'm a potato :D
<Sumica> 00,10easy to spot at a glance
<twilight_sprinkler> Firaga: verey few recordings
<Ninjazz> Who even has those tv's anymore?
<Sumica> 00,10they all have lightsabers
<Irres> Then there's people who just want to hate on something
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<otakon> XD
<Gunthler> panda: Whats a potato recording? :d
<Firaga> Ninjazz: *sniff*
<Irres> F*cking superiority complexes
<Aurora> 6I met a jehova's witness who actually didn't care that people had their own ideas on life, she was fine with it and went about her own business
<panda> Gunthler: means the quality is bad
<Aurora> 6she's a friend of mine, I'm like "woah that's a first in my life"
<Ninjazz> Terribly sorry, Firaga. :'(
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to kinda not care about religion either, but... as of recently, I want to personally go around and slap anyone in the face who says that gays shouldn't be allowed to get married because it's against their religion :/
<otakon> Gunthler: it's basically saying the quality is really bad
<panda> I know kung fu :D
<otakon> I LOVE IT!
<Vordox> LAWL
<panda> JIMMY!
<Aurora> 6see, I used to not care about that, I was semi-for prop 8
<Ninjazz> Dat Keanu Reeves.
<Rain> back in my nick again ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10I blame SNL being dicks with there videos
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no idea what prop 8 is
*Rain enjoys it
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup
<Ninjazz> Hey, Rain!
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: Their*
<otakon> LOL
<Aurora> 6but that was back when everyone thought that it would force churches to marry against their beliefs
<Irres> Drf that goes back to the "don't push your faith on others"
<Vordox> Running gag much XD
<Aurora> 6uh...that was the california proposition that went nationwide as a huge issue
<otakon> Vordox: enope
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I heard of it but I don't remember what it was about
<Aurora> 6when the church wanted same sex marriage banned
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Ninjazz> Hat!
<drfsupercenter> 03see that's the thing
<CupcakeWarrior> Meh
<Firaga> blurple
<Aurora> 6but once I figured out it wasn't going to force churches to do anything
<drfsupercenter> 03who cares what the church says? Marriage is a *legal* status, it has nothing to do with religion
<Aurora> 6I was like f* this
<Ninjazz> Rarity or Twilight would count.
<drfsupercenter> 03people get married in churches since it's all fancy
<DeathStar|sick> flerple
<Aurora> 6marriage is also a religious theme though
<drfsupercenter> 03but technically
<Rain> Potent Potables = Strong Alchoholic Drinks
<drfsupercenter> 03you can just
<drfsupercenter> 03go to a court
<drfsupercenter> 03be like
<Aurora> 6you can't isolate it as just one side
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm marrying so and so
<Aurora> 6it has two sides
<drfsupercenter> 03and done
<otakon> Four Inch......oh god
<panda> aww no more fluer :D
<drfsupercenter> 03sure you can, what do you think happens when two athiests get married :P
<Aurora> 6but for that reason, can't be settled as church's or state's
<Irres> Nonetheless marriage originated as a religious thing
<Rain> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't *have* to do it in a church, it's just a common thing
<Aurora> 6no you don't
<otakon> XD
<Firaga> oh man i cant wait for bill&ted 3
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Sumica> 00,10liteurple
<Aurora> 6but marriage IS also a religious theme
<panda> XD
<Aurora> 6I'm not saying it's the only one
<Ninjazz> lol
<Kosoveon> ^
*otakon is losing it
<drfsupercenter> 03so who cares if a certain church doesn't want to marry gays? They can just do it the legal way
<drfsupercenter> 03it can be, if you're a religious person...
<BlueFlare> 02my parents didn't get married in church
<Ninjazz> LOL
<Aurora> 6that's my f*ing point drf.
<panda> Sumica: i think i love you
<Onyxia> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/666/ omg its 666
<Irres> Drf the US id a heavily Christian nation
<Sumica> 00,10sorry for bad quality
<Vordox> LAWL
<Irres> is*
<Vordox> Ricky Martin!
<drfsupercenter> 03really, all I have to say is
<drfsupercenter> 03http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/562377_421733894512090_100000264482893_1580051_1823991963_n.jpg
<Ninjazz> Good enough, Sumi.
<drfsupercenter> 03basically that
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Aurora> 6I'm not saying it's right
<Vordox> HAHAH "Best WHoa"
<rainbro_dash> cold
<Aurora> 6I'm just saying that it is not purely at "legal" status
<Ninjazz> LOL
<CupcakeWarrior> dat timing
<otakon> HOT HOT HOT!
<panda> Sumica: no proble,
<Aurora> 6*a
<drfsupercenter> 03right, but I'm saying that in states that allow gay marriage, it basically is in that case
<otakon> Sumica: no worries it's hilarious
<drfsupercenter> 03or rather, recognize it
<Firaga> iced tea is best pony
<Kosoveon> I've been invovled with gay rights for some time, so obviously I'm sympathetic with regard to gay marriage
<drfsupercenter> 03since you can just go to canada
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6wait what
<Ninjazz> lol
<panda> XD
<Commander_Hurricane> where do these yays keep coming from
<drfsupercenter> 03at which part
<Vordox> Hahahha
<otakon> I'm surprised the recorder isn't laughing his ass off.
<Aurora> 6it is a religious status too, but that doesn't make it right to ban same sex marriage
<Aurora> 6is my point
<drfsupercenter> 03no but I mean
<otakon> I won't give you the satisfaction
<drfsupercenter> 03you can get married already, like, in Canada
<Kosoveon> I honestly don't know why people even consider gay marriage to be such a big deal
<panda> otakon: he isnt human
<drfsupercenter> 03two gay people can
<Vordox> i'm not laughing out loud at this, a small chuckle is good
<drfsupercenter> 03the question is, will the state (read: GOVERNMENT) recognize that as a legal marital status
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1649/ that's me with everypony in here
<Ninjazz> It's sweetie bot.
<drfsupercenter> 03or just consider it two people living together
<otakon> XD
<Vordox> Famous mothers below me...
<panda> below me :D
<Ninjazz> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03or say you get married in a state that allows gay marriage, then move to a state that doesn't
<rainbro_dash> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03etc etc
*Ninjazz dat laugh
<Aurora> 6uh
<Aurora> 6note this whole time I was talking about morals behind marriage, not the actual "what is happening"
<drfsupercenter> 03<Kosoveon> I honestly don't know why people even consider gay marriage to be such a big deal <- because a lot of religious people are as stubborn as I can be and refuse to acknowledge that their way isn't the only way
<otakon> LOL
<panda> XD
<Aurora> 6i didn't realize we were discussing that
<Ninjazz> lol
<Vordox> Wow. Sounds like Hollywood XD
<Kosoveon> drf, technically with regards to the constitution, they have to recognize it
<Ninjazz> Yet.
<BlueFlare> 02if someone wants to be gay, why do they have to get married in the first place? It's not like it's Illegal to be gay or even have a civil union..
<drfsupercenter> 03I was talking about it being legal, not "ethical"
<Kosoveon> full faith and credit clause
<otakon> oh god
<Aurora> 6uh
<junh1024-XD> so marrige gives caertain rights & priveledges. what are they?
<Aurora> 6marriage has a lot fo things behind it nightseas
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> so marrige gives caertain rights & priveledges. what are they? <- that's what I'm talking about.
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah basically
<Aurora> 6a lot of things besides just living together
<drfsupercenter> 03there are a couple things
<drfsupercenter> 03tax breaks
<Aurora> 6taxes
<Vordox> Sumica. Did oyu see the link I asked you? 03
<drfsupercenter> 03insurance w/e

<otakon> Sumica: BEST REACTION EVER!
<Aurora> 6I don't think there is a single state that actually outright doesn't recognize same sex marriage
<Shamroc> Sumica: they didnt want their wives to kill them
<hen3ry> bad decision if neither of them wanted to say a word...
<Vordox> This meant NOTHING to him XD He was the SMART one
<Aurora> 6 /maybe/ utah, but idk
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love Steve Harvey Family Feud~
<drfsupercenter> 03I think most don't o.o
<Kosoveon> ^
<Commander_Hurricane> Those yays
<Aurora> 6banning marriage as opposed to recognizing
<otakon> hen3ry: it was describing their wife in BED
<DeathStar|sick> the only wrong anwer was dopey
<Vordox> Steve Harvey is a great change, CrimsonPhoenix
<BlueFlare> 02I thought civil unions let people have those rights
<Commander_Hurricane> where dey comin from
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Kosoveon> there are a lot of states that have it in their constitution
<hen3ry> yes, I know. But the decision to "play?"
<Aurora> 6to not recognize it?
<Rain> Commander_Hurricane, that is the sound Sumica gets whenever someone says his name
<Kosoveon> that marriage is defined as between a man and a woman
<Commander_Hurricane> huh
<Aurora> 6k
<Kosoveon> so de facto, yes
<Commander_Hurricane> interesting

<hen3ry> C

<Gunthler> Z.
<Vinyer> i see marriage as marriage
*Phase4 hugs Kammerjunk
<Aurora> 6I see marriage as however people want to see it
<drfsupercenter> 03and heck, call it a civil union, as long as they get the same legal rights...
<DeathStar|sick> wait this is in america need to work it out again...
<Aurora> 6I don't care how people see it, that's fine
<panda> WAIT SHIT!
<drfsupercenter> 03the name is more a formality
<[web]JRP2234> dam it steam
<Kosoveon> which avoids when people go "well, if you allow gay marriage, then why not marriage with children and pets"
*Kammerjunk hugs Phase4 back.
<panda> PERPENDICULAR
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6I just flat out don't care
<hen3ry> Example of perpendicular lines: +
<panda> C!
<drfsupercenter> 03technically dogs can sign a marriage contract
<Kosoveon> that's just f*ing dumb
<drfsupercenter> 03or something silly
<Ninjazz> Hey, Kammerjunk.
<Vordox> We have our Driver side on the left side. :P
<Aurora> 6because once you care, people get upset in some way
<Commander_Hurricane> Kind of a wierd question tbh
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
<Shamroc> C
<CupcakeWarrior> THATS NOT WHAT PERPENDICULAR MEANS
<Phase4> hurry up and pick c
<Vinyer> it's the country of freedom yet they are going to try to say people can't marry who they want

<drfsupercenter> 03again:
<Kosoveon> what I mean by that aurora
<Aurora> 6you can't have a marriage with a human and an animal because we wouldn't know if the animal consented
<drfsupercenter> 03http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/562377_421733894512090_100000264482893_1580051_1823991963_n.jpg <- see this

<hen3ry> phail
<Vinyer> but false advertising
<Rain> ^
<BlueFlare> 02But how would it be legit if they’re not even sexually compatible? Again, just saying
<Kosoveon> is that neither children or animals can consent
<otakon> Sumica: SON OF A BITCH!
<Vordox> Sumica: LAAAAAAAWL
<Aurora> 6exactly
<otakon> that is DIRTY POOL!
<Ninjazz> Sumica: :D

<CupcakeWarrior> I dont even...huh?
<Kosoveon> as with many things

<Shamroc> WOO IM GONNA GO BUY A SHIRT!
<Kosoveon> define "unhealthy
<Kosoveon> "
<drfsupercenter> 03"Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children" <- there you go BlueFlare
<twilight_sprinkler> CupcakeWarrior: a sleigh has no doors
<drfsupercenter> 03and granted

<Firaga> you're a wonderful person, but you stay poor
<drfsupercenter> 03is complete sarcasm
<otakon> panda: yes it IS since SLEIGHS DO NOT HAVE DOORS
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why it's awesome
<panda> otakon: thats not the reason why she was wrong though
<Vinyer> we don't need more children

<ACS13123> Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03because of the legal rights associated with being married
<Kosoveon> because they want it to be called *marriage*
<otakon> Vordox: I think he might be
<Ghosties> 04@Vordox: I had to patch Mortal Kombat
<drfsupercenter> 03or maybe not rights, but whatever you want to call it
<drfsupercenter> 03legal status I guess?
<Kosoveon> aside from the legal benefits of it
<Vordox> Ghosties: . <.< On Console?
<Aurora> 6no the point is you left girls out, we're trying to figure out how sam-sex relationships are more unhealthy
<Aurora> 6*same
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Dash
<Phase4> uck you
<Phase4> :P

<Ghosties> 04Indeed, and now I can finally play as Kenshi~
<Gunthler> Dashie Sauce :DDDD
<Vordox> Sumica: You like anime? :P

<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Kosoveon> what
<Sumica> 00,10why not
<Vinyer> straight couples can have just as many unhealthy side effects
<Vordox> Ghosties: Tell me when the game is fun.:P
<BlueFlare> 02^
<BlueFlare> 02true
<Vinyer> *cough* STDS *cough*
<dshannon> touche
<panda> Sumica: does modest moust have anything to do with funny... or spiderman? XD
<Aurora> 6look my point is
<BlueFlare> 02but at least they can do it the right way if they want
<Ghosties> 04It is fun
<Aurora> 6you used a very horrible example
<CrimsonPhoenix> MK9 is better than the recent entries
<Kosoveon> the "right way"
<Kosoveon> what
<Ghosties> 04Muuuuuuuuuuuuuch better
<CupcakeWarrior> IM A PONY
<Phase4> pony XD
<Aurora> 6and all of us had a perfect way to oppose your example
<CrimsonPhoenix> but nowhere good for competitive gmaeplay
<Kosoveon> I didn't know there was a "right" way
<panda> pony :D
<DeathStar|sick> pony
<Aurora> 6ok well
<Firaga> Ghosties: i learned a long time ago that playing MK with bros is the best way to spend an evening
<Aurora> 6you know what he means
<Vinyer> it doesn't really matter
<panda> XD
<ACS13123> ;P
<Kosoveon> I know
<ACS13123> :P
<ACS13123> :D
<CupcakeWarrior> ...
<Aurora> 6the natural way of reproduction
<Kosoveon> the way it was worded was what bothered me
<Sumica> 00,10is it bad I am laughing at theses
<ACS13123> XD
<panda> Eat dick nigga :D
<dshannon> nope
<Aurora> 6i wouldn't say right way either, but eh
<Phase4> Sumica: nope
<Shamroc> Sumica...no im laughing my ASS off right now
<ACS13123> This is great....
<dshannon> dis shat funny
<Aurora> 6that specifically is for personal opinions
<BlueFlare> 02Kosovo, I didn’t want to sound suggestive
<Rain> win
<Ghosties> 04The problem is that none of my friends actually want to play fighting games with me
<Rain> song
<Aurora> 6that is a fact that can't be argued, unlike his earlier one
<Phase4> 60's spiderman is so prone to meme
<panda> Ghosties: cuz you are so good :D
<Vordox> Ghosties: I only have ONE game I like when fighting, the Blazblue Series.
<Vinyer> this issue can't be solved in congress, it won't be solved in a chatroom
<Vinyer> XD
<Ghosties> 04That actually is the case, panda
<dshannon> definitely gay
<Rain> I would love to play fighting games with you, Ghosties. But we dont have any in common :<
<Ghosties> 04None of them play fighting games except for me >>
<BlueFlare> 02lmao
<Kosoveon> I know, but the way you said it implied it was the only way it should be done
<drfsupercenter> 03who said anything about solving it?
<ACS13123> :D
<BlueFlare> 02true
<Onyxia> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4403/
<drfsupercenter> 03It's just a debate :P
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6actually
<panda> Ghosties: i wish i could say challenge accepted but i had to pawn my ps3 :(
<Aurora> 6in congress, people are more politic based
<Vinyer> yeah
<Ghosties> 04Actually, Vordox reminded me that a couple of them do play BlazBlue and Guilty Gear
<Aurora> 6us as everyday people, admittedly we have a different grasp
<Vinyer> and results can come from the most unlikely of places sometimes
<Kosoveon> I disapprove of your bill Aurora, I am gonna filibuster it :|
<Aurora> 6not to mention congress is a bunch of older ages people
*Kosoveon runs
<dshannon> yeah fu...nvm
<Ghosties> 04But I don't play those games much, so I'm no good at them :I
<Vinyer> like the little girl who found a way to beat cancer
<Aurora> 6we're actually a part of the new generation
<Rain> same reason nobody likes to play fighting games with me :\
<Vordox> Ghosties: Of course, the good gamess has fans that won't release, instead of the Mainstream who just throws stuff aside quickly :P
<Phase4> knifegun!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Skrillex?
<CrimsonPhoenix> NOPE MUTE
<CupcakeWarrior> MY EARS
<Vordox> Ghosties: Try training Blazblue! IT's fun when you understand the mechanics!
<dshannon> 0.o
<Rain> oh god, scrilix :\
<Vinyer> well we are
<Vinyer> not sure about kyu
*Vinyer hides
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow
<Kosoveon> !vinyer
<Ghosties> 04>implying Mortal Kombat 9 is "just thrown aside quickly"
<Vinyer> sorry
<CrimsonPhoenix> people here hate Skrillex?
<Kosoveon> sadface

<CrimsonPhoenix> I love you guys even more
<Ghosties> 04And yes
<Sumica> 00,10owwwww
<CupcakeWarrior> People actually like this?
<Ghosties> 04I don't care for Skrillex
<Aurora> 6huh
<Vordox> Ghosties: Of course not, I meant SS4, MvC3 etc etc.
<Aurora> 6that was another earthquake i believe
<Sumica> 00,10I prefered the last song
<Vordox> The "Big big ones"
<Vinyer> o-o
<dshannon> popeska bro

<otakon> dat anime ripoff
<Vordox> Firaga: Good luck finding it.
<Vinyer> i'll agree with that, i am not sure if it was originally thought of when it was first made
<Kosoveon> if you are using that as a personal statement that is fine nightseas
<Vinyer> but that doesn't mean it's right to shoot the idea down
<Vordox> WHAT THE BUCK IS HAPPENING IN THE STREAM!? MErry Melodies?! NO way!
<drfsupercenter> 03Some old religious lady was trying to say that the reason Judas betrayed Jesus, is because Judas was homosexual
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<otakon> Vordox: it's a okay show, the Merry Melodies are the better stuff
<CupcakeWarrior> This should be an entire series
<CrimsonPhoenix> The whole is more slice-of-life
<Kosoveon> well aurora it depends on the perspective of the group
<Ghosties> 04Also, Vordox, I have MvC3
<Aurora> 6but in the case of religion vs state, there really is no absolute answer
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean sure it's a good cause
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6perspective of a group
<drfsupercenter> 03but protesting doesnt'really help it
<Onyxia> wait what is that
<Shamroc> .......good god
<Vordox> Ghosties: And how fun is that game when in Meta?
<Rain> this is gold
<BlueFlare> 02See, I don’t mind when people are gay/for gays, but I also don’t mind when people are against gays as long as they don’t try to be bias
<ACS13123> Guess what? I have half life 3 :P
<MyLittleDashie> that is how my mind works
<Vordox> YAY!

<Ghosties> 04Now where are you going with the conversation, because all I said is that I'm not getting into an argument over adultswim and CN being or not being the same company
<CupcakeWarrior> Why are people so excited about toonami coming back?
<Vordox> I think you both misunderstood and communicated wrongly, Ghosties and Sumica
<CrazyCherry> I love my aunt.
<Vinyer> rawr

<ditzyderpydoo> I have a confession to make. I have been anti pony for quite a while until today, it all started with a simple clip on youtube, then I watched a random episode. I have been watching my little pony for the past eleven hours and I have not slept at all. WHATS HAPPENED TO ME
<dshannon> aj stood no chance
<Ninjazz> The sad thing about this episode is that most forget that this is a AJ episode. The Derpy Incident overshadowed most the like for this.
<Ghosties> 04Ditzy, get out while you still can
<Vordox> ditzyderpydoo: You found the magic in the show. :D
<ditzyderpydoo> help
<ditzyderpydoo> me
<Ghosties> 04Or just stay here, or something
<Sumica> 00,10"diffrent devisions of the same parent corp"
<Mutterguy> ditzyderpydoo, that's pretty much the pony taking over
<ACS13123> maybe...*sniff* maybe

<MyLittleDashie> i havnt slept in 50 hours and counting
<Sumica> 00,10guess I was too obscure then sorry if I came off as dissagreeing with you
<CrazyCherry> ditzyderpydoo: GO SLEEP RIGHT NOW!!
*Starflash made a Cherrychanga some time ago :3

<ACS13123> Buiscuits and Gravy
<Vordox> Ghosties: damnit Ghosties. now I am hungry too...

<ACS13123> YOU PINKIE PROMISEDX
<Vordox> ditzyderpydoo: Those are the worst about bronies, just make it smooth for others if you want to advert for the hsow
<Ninjazz> ditzyderpydoo: You sound just like me a few months ago.
<MysteryPony> Pinki assasin
<CrazyCherry> Pinkie rage.
<ACS13123> OH NO SHE DIDNT
<BlueFlare> 02yay Solar Eclipse
<ditzyderpydoo> no bunny nooooo
<Sumica> 00,10So far as defending masseffect. Yeah some parts of what Nitt spouts off is just horseshit so I will call him on it.
<ditzyderpydoo> aw :'3
<Vinyer> let's be honest here
<Vordox> Sumica: That's the power of disagrement, noone is right noone is wrong. :)
<Vinyer> are you at all in the path for t he full eclipse
<CrazyCherry> Dat Bunny
<Ghosties> 04Like I said, I don't want to get too far into an argument like that :P
<BlueFlare> 02yep
<ACS13123> what in the what the what the what?
<Ninjazz> I blame EA.
<Ghosties> 04Hell, I'm not even a fan of Mass Effect
<Vinyer> wow
<Vinyer> jealous :P
<ACS13123> anyone get the reference?
<ACS13123> no/
<Ghosties> 04So it's honestly not like I know the whole truth or anything
<ACS13123> ?
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: Why no Mass Effect 3 stream?
<ACS13123> ...
<Sumica> 00,10cause I dont feel like gaming
<ACS13123> PINKIE PROMISE
<ditzyderpydoo> why do I keep hearing "yay" :o
<ACS13123> BREAK IT AND YOU'RE DEAD
<ACS13123> Sumica
<Ninjazz> ditzyderpydoo: That's the streamer's ping.
<ACS13123> = YAY
<Vordox> If you're bored Sumica: Try streamplayng the Magic is the boredom.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ditzyderpydoo: Those are the pings
<ditzyderpydoo> ooh
<dshannon> no loop hole there she broke the promise
<ditzyderpydoo> it's adorable <3

<ACS13123> yay ;3
<ditzyderpydoo> yayyy :3
<Kandarihu> So this version, it was the one where Derpy had the male voice, right?
<Ghosties> 04Like I said, I don't either

<Vordox> "Oh "Buy some apples""
<Ninjazz> Do you like CoD/
<CrazyCherry> Ghosties: I thought so....
<ACS13123> O D
<ditzyderpydoo> Did the conflict with derpy hooves being "offensive" ever end with original derpy getting back on the show?
<Ghosties> 04I dunno, it's just not my cup of tea
<ACS13123> You ded now?
<Ghosties> 04I prefer Doom
<Vordox> Applejack and her pride... <3
<Ninjazz> ^
<Ninjazz> Damn.
<Ghosties> 04Very fast, very brutal, all manly
<ACS13123> ditzyderpydoo: Its coming back in the future
<CrazyCherry> Ghosties: Yay Dom!!
<ACS13123> Derpy i mean
<Ninjazz> Doom was the good old days.
<ditzyderpydoo> yayyyy <3
<Ghosties> 04Lol Dom
<CrazyCherry> Doom*
<Vordox> Ghosties: Doom 3?
<Ghosties> 04Doom 3 is good, I have it on Xbox and PC
<Vinyer> drfsupercenter will take pictures of it, don't worry
<ACS13123> Every game, but halo 2
*Vinyer hides
<Ghosties> 04But Doom II is my favorite FPS of all time :)
<ditzyderpydoo> doom 4 coming soon, itl probably be another duke nukem forever
<Ghosties> 04Oh god I hope not
<Vordox> Ghosties: My favorite FPS? Duke Nukem.
<ACS13123> Every Pony, But you
<Ghosties> 04I really, really hope it won't be a DKF
<Ninjazz> It's sad that he is probably right.
<Ghosties> 04DON'T SAY THAT ;_;
<AlienEd27> naaaw

<Ghosties> 04Doom 3 was a vast departure and it was pretty good :O
<dshannon> fluttershy, why you make everyone cry?!
<Vordox> Ghosties: Have some hope for Doom 4. I heard some interesting rumours about it
<ACS13123> Its fluttershy
<Ninjazz> Their last game was RAGE.
<ditzyderpydoo> big maaac :3
<alexxm> crusj jer
*Ghosties has RAGE too
<ditzyderpydoo> rage on PC was horrible
<ACS13123> weee....

<ACS13123> weeee
<ACS13123> ....
<MysteryPony> PILEUP
<ACS13123> weweee.
<Ninjazz> Better*
<Kandarihu> I think this whole controversy over Derpy Hooves being offensive won't be settled until sometime in Season 3, provided there is an episode completely dedicated to Derpy Hooves, subverting the shame that the anti-Derpy camp felt were being sent.
<Ghosties> 04RAGE is alright
<ACS13123> MY LITTLE PONy...MY LITTLE PONY....
<Twi_Fi> yay
<Sumica> 00,10and with that I am done.

<MysteryPony> Why does RD going to get it???

<Shane377_The_Alicorn> and alexxm as well
<Ninjazz> Considering how many game stories suck nowadays, that wouldn't be a bad thing.
<Phase4> DAMNIT! my brain is processing coding ideas, problem is they are javascript ideas and it realy should be on my classwork which is c and pascal
<Ghosties> 04...okay, I'll admit, I don't want Doom 4 to be a multiplayer experience purely
<ACS13123|Lolwut> Wrek can you kick the normal ACS13123 for me? i think it bugged
<Kandarihu> In any case, the whole point of this series is to reconcile audiences that MLP was always meant for (young girls) with audiences that normally never had any interest at all (us). It's unacceptable for there to be a broken base in this fandom.
<Ninjazz> lol Shane377_The_Alicorn :D

<Ghosties> 04Blueberry muffins
<Ghosties> 04Lucky
<ACS13123> yay, mor Beyond good and evil :)
<Phase4> Wrek, dat crysalist
<Vinyer> pretty much go wild and start taking pictures of the air randomly over and over again until you hit it
<Phase4> i cant spell that word
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz: why do you doubt my intentions?
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu: If I recall correctly, you seem to like the old gens... namely 3.5.
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Crysalis
<BlueFlare> 02inb4: use a 1800MM lens and look through the view finder
<Ninjazz> No thats a derp too.
<Ninjazz> Chrysalis.
<Kandarihu> Not nearly as much as ValtheJean
<Vinyer> lol
<Ninjazz> But the point is, you would respect viewer demands with "poines" right?
<Ghosties> 04"Ponies
<Ghosties> 04"
<Kandarihu> I will respect viewer demands of the animation of G4, and not go all genie on you.
<Ghosties> 04Key word "Ponies"
<Wrek> 05good news guys
<Ninjazz> ponies*...
<Vinyer> darnit i need to blow my nose
<Ghosties> 04Oh wait, we're not talking streaming ponies :P
<Vinyer> but i don't want to wake anyone up
<Ninjazz> How did I miss that?
<Wrek> 05i jsut got hold of the hardest item to get in D3 needed for the secret pony level
<BlueFlare> 02I probably won't use a Telephoto lens
<Wrek> 053 to go
<Ninjazz> :O
<BlueFlare> 02to play it safe
<Phase4> ok, up to where i was
<Ghosties> 04Best of luck, Wrek
<Mutterguy> Wrek, we're hearing this in proffessor farnsworth voice?
<Ghosties> 04Oh, and I wasn't trying to correct you Ninjazz :P
<Phase4> Wrek, you gona stream or shal i?
<Ghosties> 04In fact, I thought you said it right
<Wrek> 05uh
<Ninjazz> lol
<Ghosties> 04But bleh, no troubles
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR5DaYuDWYs&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=1 :D
<Wrek> 05sure i could strem soe
<Ninjazz> Thanks, man. :)
<Kandarihu> However, I will do it on my own time. I might stream stuff that's well, "difficult" to watch. And you don't even HAVE to ask for ponies. I'll stream an episode after it.
<Bronies4evar> Does someone belive in The Hub for the rerun in 1 1/4 hours?
<Vordox> Did the new herd member go to bed?
<Ninjazz> I see, Kandarihu. But you probably would get tired after the first 100 demands of poines.
<Vordox> Ghosties: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLD3aqkGYWM&feature=bf_next&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ <-- :D ValTheJean would LOVE this
<Ninjazz> He went to go get some breakfast, Vordox.
<Vordox> Ninjazz: He needed sleep ><
<Vinyer> why not use both?
<Wrek> 05story of my life: http://imgur.com/rsotr
<Ninjazz> He said he was going to, ;_;
<Ninjazz> lol Wrek
<Ninjazz> I don't even hide it anymore, it still feels odd as hell.
<Phase4> lol Wrek
<MysteryPony> Wrek: are you closet brony???
<BlueFlare> 02See, I’m kind of worried about my camera's sensor :\
<Ghosties> 04Interesting video, Vordox
<Mutterguy> i figured that if he started watching all the episodes he must be nearly half way through season 2
<Vordox> Ghosties: It's based on the DS version of Robot Master Wars series
<Vordox> It's the final boss theme
<Kandarihu> Maybe. But I know there is a common interest among everyone who comes here. It's not video games or Japanese anime. It's not classic cartoons or live action shows. It's Ponies. And it's not ponies as they've been known all my life. It's the G4 ponies alone. That's what we ALL love.
<Ghosties> 04Oh, neat
<Vordox> A sec, let me find the original
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhO9DzQmlak
<Vordox> From here
<ACS13123> whos streaming then?
<Wrek> 05look closley MysteryPony
<Ninjazz> Sounds like a KH bgm, Vordox.

<Lighty> Hai
<Whoofs> *bro hooves vordox*
<Ninjazz> Unnecessary math, Vordox,
<Kandarihu> Val seems to think that the Brony identity entails a love of all generations. I don't think that way. That said, I DO like the twintailed mane of G3.5 Cheerilee. I just find it different and immorality excepted, I like different.
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Correct. that is PM and AM
<Ninjazz> Much easier to just say 8:55pm
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Good point, :)
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Oh really?
<Kandarihu> Thanks
<Whoofs> Kuma
<Whoofs> ._.
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<Vordox> Oh hai, it's 12:35 here! "Cool it's 21:23 Here"
<Ninjazz> Least for us lazy 'Mericans.
<Vordox> "Oh we're 9 hours off!"
<Whoofs> :/
<Vordox> Otherwise it's "Oh it's 11 PM here" "Oh it's 14:52" here
<Vordox> "....the fu?"

<Whoofs> Umm yes

<Vordox> Fun Fact. We CAN travel back in time...We don't know how :P
<Whoofs> *makes nanomagentic sonic dimaond
<Whoofs> Is this awsome?
<Ninjazz> Making facts about things not known yet is fun, ain't it?
<Whoofs> i make anything
<Vordox> Although there's one issue, the Time line itself needs to be curved. XD
<MysteryPony> I am a SumoScientist

<Whoofs> *hides my own doll behied back*
<CrazyCherry> It says this in the corner: Saturday Anniversary Movies: 17 hours ago
<Whoofs> i dont have anything

<Sumica> 00,10I usealy finish up a few things before I crash out
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Don't think so
<Vordox> Sumica: Alright, well in case, Sleep well. :)
<Ninjazz> I'd be surprised we still exist for that long, but yeah, we probably will found out how to do things.
<Sumica> 00,10*facehoof*
<Wrek> 05who be this?
<Sumica> 00,10oh sounds like wrek is looking for OC ideas

<Whoofs> hyper speed
<Whoofs> dadasd
<Whoofs> wdaawfagrgregerherh
<Vordox> Was I close Wrek?
<Kandarihu> Heh. Somehow the music became a SFX from Dragonball Z for a few seconds there.
<Wrek> 05how should i know? thats why i asked
<Vordox> >.>
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry no. I have to keep my bed from flying off during that time and I wont be able to stream the edited rerun of yesterdays eps
<Kandarihu> SSJ2 ambience
<Vordox> I thought it was a question, not a suggestion, Wrek
<Vordox> Okay Wrek...
<Ninjazz> Alright, Sumi. Your lose.
*Ninjazz sips coffee
<Vordox> It's Applehack, the Black sheep of the Apple family that's a computer hacker mechanic geek
<Vordox> HAH!
<Bronies4evar> Bed from flying off???
<Sumica> 00,10I think wrek wants you to post OC's cause he's trying to draw a pony
<Vordox> OH!

<Vordox> http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/551246_298146203587662_100001768545043_737413_170638067_n.jpg
<Ninjazz> I don't got an OC. So I'm screwed.
<Sumica> 00,10correct me if I am wrong wrek
<CrazyCherry> Draw me please?
<Vordox> Then again.. He looks be drawing rather frivilious... Hmm
<Ninjazz> Nice monicle, Vordox.
<MysteryPony> Wrek: I want to eat your brain! and gain your drawing powers!!!
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Thank you, Pony.
<Ninjazz> Pony? I'm but a humble jazz ninja amongst ponies.
<Sumica> 00,10carefull Vordox you might end up a mare like me.
<Vordox> Sumica: Okay don't draw me. XD
<Sumica> 00,10Oh I dont draw
<Ninjazz> Your problem is that your name sounds like a girls name.
<Vordox> I already recommend Applehack, the sister mare of Applejack that's a black sheep of the apple family that's a computer mechanic geek :P
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: I forgot you are a mare.
<Ninjazz> But being a mare OC ain't that bad.
<Vordox> NInjazz: Once I get around I'll make a cull fustom OC of me. in Desktop Ponies. :)
<Sumica> 00,10eh it might bug some Ninjazz. I am geting used to it though
<Ninjazz> Good to know, Sumi.
<CrazyCherry> I'm a mare OC.
<Ninjazz> Being a mare can be cool! Right?...
<Ninjazz> Nice, Vordox. Alot of work that is.
<Vordox> I think Wrek's just randomly pitting in what he thinks looks good. :p
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Not really
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Just do the lineart animation done in sprites, rest is easy
<Ninjazz> Sounds like work to me. :P
<Vordox> Ninjazz: You can make a 8 sprite animation within a day
<Vordox> Ninjazz: And that's a detailed one
<Vordox> Anyway, I gotta get back to my Coding in GML for my Network Game Project. <.<
<Ninjazz> But that's assuming I know what the hay I need to do to being.
<Ninjazz> begin*
<Vordox> Ninjazz: It's easier then you thin
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Start low, like 32x32
<Ninjazz> Perhaps, it always is. >_>
<XAX> Vordox: GML?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Then try it out! Who knows you might be as good as Wrek within Freehand within the right resolution in minutes
<Vordox> Game Maker Language
<XAX> Omg I'm doing a game maker project at the moment too
<Twi_Fi> Hey XAX.
<Ninjazz> I might try, Vordox. If I get the time.
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi! You!
<XAX> Hello Twi_Fi :3
<Bronies4evar> So... can anypony at least report if derpy comes back.
<Bronies4evar> 55 minutes to go.
<Vordox> Ninjazz: I can help you out via skype in case you need a coach =3
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz: Me?
<Vordox> XAX: Ned a hand ?
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)
<Ninjazz> It's alright, man. No need to bother with me.
<Twi_Fi> Hello TheRainbowDash.
<Vordox> Ah sorry on second though I have 3 days on me to make this code compelte. XD
<Ninjazz> Hey, Dashie.
<XAX> Vordox: Nah I'm doing ok, thanks.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Ninjazz :)
<Vordox> A 5 week project within 1 and a hal week...is kinda stressfull
<Ninjazz> Hey, Twi_Fi. Good to see you coming out of hiding.
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Pfft, you give up too easily. :)
<Ninjazz> Vordox: True story.
<Ninjazz> :(
<XAX> Good morning/afternoon/evening/whateverthefuq TheRainbowDash.
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: Hahaha, it is morning over here, 7:10 AM
<Vordox> Ninjazz: You have an OC? =3
<Twi_Fi> Yes, I hide here quite regularly.
<Ninjazz> Nope, I do not. :c
<Bronies4evar> TheRainbowDash: Have the channel?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Do one for now, just a sketch drawing, accessor, style, colours, mane, tail etc et.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Wait, what channel?
<Vordox> Just a sketch
<Kandarihu> I hear Nittany_Discord is working on getting a stream of Trackmania Nations Forever stream going on here, but I guess it's more complicated than just us all jumping on a server.
<Ninjazz> I also suck at drawing. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I do too!:D
<Bronies4evar> TheRainbowDash: The one where the new episodes of MLP airs.
<Ninjazz> Yay! I'm not alone. :)
<Vordox> Ninjazz: I told you, a sketch doesn't have to be uber nce, it's a "this is how I kinda want it to be"
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz: You can use the Pony Creator instead.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Umm, I believe I do have tha channel, actually.
<CrazyCherry> I'm a good drawer.
<Vordox> Wrek: That's Applejack? O.o
<Twi_Fi> This song.....
<Kandarihu> I wonder if someone might be willing to make FiM-related skins, avatars and horns.
<ACS13123> k then...
<Bronies4evar> TheRainbowDash: Can you take a favor?
<Ninjazz> I see what you're talking about, Vordox.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Uhh, sure, whatever it is.

<Vordox> XAX: What are you working on? Got a portfolio site? =3
<TheRainbowDash> Uhh, sure, about Derpy, umm, don't worry about that.
<Bronies4evar> :)
<XAX> Vordox: Nah I've only just got into game maker, really.
<Vordox> Wrek, want a challenge on what to draw? :D
<Ninjazz> She ain't coming back, Bronies4evar.
<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: WAKE UP!

<Bronies4evar> TheRainbowDash: Dat emoticon.
<Vordox> Who is that Pony? O.o
<TheRainbowDash> Woah, that drawing is amazing.
<Ninjazz> It looks like a blue Wrek.
<Vordox> Is that you Wrek?
<XAX> Vordox: The teacher doesent expect us to do anything with actual code in GM. we're only doing stuff with built in events and actions
<XAX> >_>
<Vordox> XAX: Urgh Drag and Drop XD
<Vordox> XAX: Well that is also good. I can handle those good too. :)

<Irish_Pony|Blind> I just love them :$
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Oh, good to hear! I am well, tired because I just woke up.
<Malavolent> Such is life in soviet America. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Yeah, the 3 color combination on the mane and tail really stand out, and looks awesome.
<Kandarihu> You know, I suppose the stallions of Equestria could stand to be a bit more manly. However, this is a peaceful kingdom with a female monarch and a prodominantly female population. Masculinity might be a lost cause there.
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Ah, hello there, my name is Niko Bellic.:D
<MysteryPony> omg TheRainbowDash is on :)
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu: Tell that to Iron Will.
<TheRainbowDash> MysteryPony: Hay yeah I am on!
<Kandarihu> Good point.
<Malavolent> I think they just don't show manly stallions in the show much.
<Ninjazz> Then again it's not so much about being masculine with him. More like "If someone tries to block, show them..." and all that jazz.
<TheRainbowDash> Oh hay, I forgot that I need to work on my story, need to get my 5th chapter finished, and complete 3 more chapters by the end of TODAY.

<Malavolent> Hey, is there any exact date when S3 should come out?
<Twi_Fi> Hello Tarku.
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Kandarihu> I heard that there was a survey that revealed that what women want in men depends on the times. During times of trouble, women want men who can protect them. During stable times, women want men to be sensitive to their feelings. Equestria is a peaceful kingdom.
<Malavolent> But it should be around this summer, shouldn't it?
*Twi_Fi likes this music.
<Major_Frank> Ello there
<Twi_Fi> Hello Major_Frank/
<Ninjazz> Major_Frank, welcome.
<Twi_Fi> Not sure why the / is there.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Major_Frank! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)

<Ninjazz> Am I doing this right?
<Bronies4evar> The eight o'clock rerun in 33 minutes.
<Vordox> Whoa, we have N4X and XAX XD
<alexxm> good N4X
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Uhhh, let me handle that for now.:D
*Irish_Pony|Blind sips tea
<N4X> I throw my hooves up in the air sometimes?
<Ninjazz> Oh fine... :I
<XAX> Saying aaaaeeeeyo
<Kandarihu> As much as I'm loving this music, I'm going to get in trouble for hanging around too much longer. I am NOT suppose to have the stream going on overnight like what happens every night.
<N4X> Parasprite K.O
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Yeah, you looked really nsane and like a crazy pony. Ponies will think you are a physchopath and will try to kill you.
<TheRainbowDash> (insane)
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: O_O
<Ninjazz> Well, then...
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: So....let me do the waving and what not next time.
<alexxm> what about me TheRainbowDash i do starnger things
<Ninjazz> I guess I won't have dreams about flying anymore...
<Malavolent> Kandarihu: Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated to the night squad.
<alexxm> stranger
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Nah...nah, I do the most of insane things, but you still act like an insane pony also/
*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash
<Bronies4evar> It's almost 7:30 am EST now. Th-th-thirty minutes left.
<Om> Everything I do is perfectly normal.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: D'awww...*nuzzles you*
<Ninjazz> I doubt that, Om.
<TheRainbowDash> Om: I think that is completely false. There is no normal way to do something.
<TheRainbowDash> Rather, everypony in here and in the world is insane./
<Bronies4evar> Forgetting derpy, Remember last friday when there was a "Rarity pony hour"?
<Om> My way is the normal way.
<Malavolent> Define normal.
<Om> Me.
<Bronies4evar> Today, there will be an Applejack pony hour.
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Absolute wrong hay.
<TheRainbowDash> Oops, my bad...:D
<N4X> What Rarity Pony hour?
<Ninjazz> YES
<Ninjazz> FUND IT!
<Malavolent> I dunno, I don't think anything like normal exist.
<TheRainbowDash> Nah, Dashie hour, I will PAY to see that.
<Vordox> Bronies4evar: Where?
<Twi_Fi> Cheese
<Malavolent> Luna weekend marathon? Anyone in?
<TheRainbowDash> Toast?
<Om> Malavolent: Probobly not, but why stress it then eh?
<Bronies4evar> Vordox: Where do ya think? The Hub.
<Malavolent> Om: Don't know, just overthinking.
<Vordox> <.< LOL Aj HAS no hour...
<Twi_Fi> Apple
<Om> Nothing wrong with that.
*alexxm teaches TheRainbowDash how to do a chokeslam
<Vordox> OH yeah; AJ and Rarity, AJ and everyone following her...THERE is no real focus on AJ anywhere. :(
<Vordox> So that's not possible to have a AJ only hour
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Uhh, I got my own ways to hurt ponies, it is all ok.
<Ninjazz> Aye, Vordox. Sad be that.
<Ninjazz> Very sad.
<Wrek> 05this song :3
<Vordox> Too "crunchy" atm..sounds like Dubstep not sure what to do.. :P
<Ninjazz> You have a very varried music library, Wrek.
<Vordox> Also, has anyone noticed, Dubsteb is probably the easiest genre to make songs for. <.<
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<F22skyhunter> sup guys i'm back
<Malavolent> Vordox: How so?
<Ninjazz> F22skyhunter, welcome.
<Vordox> Only thing is easier I can think of the 4 Chord template.
<Vordox> After that Dubstep
<Vordox> Malavolent: Less rules.
<Malavolent> For example?
<Twi_Fi> Welcome back F22skyhunter.
<Bronies4evar> The star of today's rerun hour: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Applejack
<alexxm> hey F22skyhunter hows your day been
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Applejack is meh in my eyes.
<Vordox> Malavolent: Less focus on filling, less concentration of notes with more outdrown moments within the stretches
<Malavolent> Bronies4evar: Wikia is the best pony.
<Vordox> Not sure on the terms. :P
<F22skyhunter> alexxm: nice thanks i'm about continue my mlp comic
<Bronies4evar> TheRainbowDash: Remember.... 8.04 am.
<Ninjazz> Theres a damn picture I'm trying to get for you, Dashie. BUT I CAN'T FREAKIN FIND IT!
<Malavolent> Vordox: I think i understand, and I agree.
<alexxm> whats it about F22skyhunter
<Wrek> 05>crunchy >mentions dubstem instead of sphycadelic hardcore
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Yeah, got it.
<Vordox> Malavolent: Doesn't mean it's bad, don't get me wrong
<Wrek> 05>mfw
<Vordox> Wrek: Dubstep can be called alot :P
<Malavolent> Vordox: I don't like it, so I don't care about that. :D
<Vordox> I clearly hear "wubs" in that song
<N4X> Hey is this your OC Wrek?
<TheRainbowDash> Dubstep is the (wubwubwub) stuff, becasue Scratch told me it was.:D
<Wrek> 05hell no
<N4X> Just asking :D
<Vordox> Dubstep is probably the hardest genre also to point somewhere. <.<
<alexxm> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4156 TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Is it Photo Finish Wrek?
<Bronies4evar> Keep your fingers (hooves) crossed for her.
<N4X> The hair just reminded me
<Ninjazz> Proper dubstep atleast.
<Vordox> I hear wubs, where they stretch a note with vibrations within a electrical synth part, Wrek ><
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Uhh, o...k....
<Malavolent> I should probably unmute sounds, I have no idea what are you talking about.
<Ninjazz> Finally found it.
<alexxm> what TheRainbowDash
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Heres your Rainbow Dash hour.
<Ninjazz> http://i.imgur.com/JDErk.png
<F22skyhunter> alexxm: it's really hard to explain but it will be set in post-apocalyptic Equestria and the main character will be RD. I'm trying to great really deep and emotional atmosphere into my comic
<Twi_Fi> o_o
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<Twi_Fi> o_o
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<alexxm> sounds intresting F22skyhunter
<Vordox> Malavolent: Now it's another song
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: YES! Absolutely amazing, I would pay to see that show, if it exists, and hopefully, it does.:)
<Malavolent> It seems like every second person here writes a fanfic.
<Ninjazz> Fund it, Dashie.
<Vordox> I AM CREATING A network GAME for my game project that will have a ...a...utställning...Exhibition!
<F22skyhunter> alexxm: the atmosphere would be something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QaVsMBJzaU&feature=channel&list=UL
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Yeah I already completed one, working on a 2nd one. And I will fund that show Ninjazz, big stuff,.
<Ninjazz> ;)
<Ninjazz> You never told me about those revisions, TheRainbowDash.
<Malavolent> It's interesting how many people do fandom for this show.
<N4X> I miss Invi...
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Oh wow, i just checked the veiws on my deviantart channel, it shot up to 20 veiws :)
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Bear in minds I am a Rarity fan.
<Ninjazz> You can thank me for a couple, Irish_Pony|Blind.
<teh_Tharassan> *lets out a long moan and scratches ass* hey every one
<Vordox> Malavolent: This is not a game with ponies, that's the Flash Project I am working on
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ummm, oh right! The revisions are pretty cool, and I'll implement some of them in my story, but again, not my style, so not all (descriptive wrods and flow of sentence words) wil exactly make it.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Well you don't see many Rarity fans nowadays. ;)
<Renard> http://e621.net/data/5e/5e/5e5e52abf27b6013b71c018fd9ea951a.png
<Vordox> Malavolent: AJ got still more then AJ :P
<Vordox> f
<Vordox> Rarity and AJ there, derp
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I kept most of your word structure in tact.
<Malavolent> Vordox: Wait, what?
<Vordox> Rarity has more fans then AJ
<Malavolent> Oh, better.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Indeed. :(
<Ninjazz> But everyone doesn't hate AJ.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, I saw that. 75% of the stuff is still the same.
<Vordox> Don't you just hate it when you think faster then you act?
<Ninjazz> People tend to hate Rarity.
<N4X> Would I be so honored to get to know to your deviantart name? Irish_Pony|Blind ?
<F22skyhunter> #alexxm
<Malavolent> My favourite three ponies are already clear, AJ would be 4th.
<Renard> Why, both are fine, really
<Bronies4evar> Rarity, Applejack, A rivalry.
<N4X> ?
<N4X> Wut?
<teh_Tharassan> what did you make Irish_Pony|Blind ?
<Wrek> 05the reallyt defining difference is that this feels like an actual song
<Vordox> What Wrek?
<Ninjazz> I don't think I show how much of a fan of Pinkie Pie I am.
<N4X> Oh come on are we again in the best pony argue?
<Vordox> N4X: Nah
<Ninjazz> But yeah, third place is pretty open to anyone who can impress me the msot.
<Renard> Crackle is best pony
<Irish_Pony|Blind> N4X Monopoly907 teh_Tharassan http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d50gs3p
<Vordox> We're talking about the fans behind the ponies.
<N4X> Oh well then...
<Vordox> Okay, I am CERTAIN that's not a Wrek pony anymore. :P He's not a PEgasus
<Malavolent> Wonder how many Celesria fans are out there.
<teh_Tharassan> Irish_Pony|Blind: thats pretty damn cool
<Malavolent> She sure does deserve more fans.
<Malavolent> Celestia* damnit.
<Vordox> Malavolent: There's less Celestia fan then Trollestiia :P
<Irish_Pony|Blind> And Wrek is giving himself some wings.....
<Om> Celestia is one of my faveorite ponies.
<N4X> I always wondered why Luna got a bigger Fan base than Celestia
<Malavolent> Vordox: Or Molestia. Poor Celestia, she is neither cute or villain to be favourite.
<Bronies4evar> Twenty minutes till rerun hour.
<Vordox> Cause Luna isn' perfect.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> N4X i think its because she was a villian and its because of the way she talked
<alexxm> Bronies4evar http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/
<N4X> The royal Canterlot voice? :D
<Irish_Pony|Blind> N4X ya that voice :P
<TheRainbowDash> N4X: What about the voice? (screaming in your face):D
<N4X> God I once saw a video...fluff such an earra..
*N4X is blown away by the volume
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY
<N4X> I don't even...
<N4X> Hey Bronysith!
<teh_Tharassan> hey Bronysith
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Bronysith! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<alexxm> hey Bronysith hows your day been
<Malavolent> Watching Wrek drawing wings, I've read that female pony's wing lenght is equal to breast size in humans.
<N4X> Wow...now that's a giant wing
<Bronysith> good alexxm (Hugs TheRainbowDash )
<N4X> WHAT?!
<Malavolent> I hope you understand that sentence.
<Bronysith> Malavolent: huuuuu
<N4X> Where the hell did you read that Malavolent?!
<N4X> Wow dude...celestia
<alexxm> Malavolent http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari always dresses in style.
<Malavolent> I've read it somewhere, don't remember where. Don't know if it even was official.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Ah, cool to hear! Just woke up about 45 minutes ago, but then I realized I have to finish 3 chapters by the end of today.
<N4X> Irish_Pony|Blind Wow "a Walk in the woods" is simply magnificent!
<Irish_Pony|Blind> N4X :$
<Om> Malavolent: I doubt the hub would say something like that.
<MadSurge> Ohei Bronystate!
<Malavolent> Also, someone said that Derpy has the longest wings.
<teh_Tharassan> hey MadSurge
<Bronies4evar> Time is... 7:48 am.
<Malavolent> It kinda makes sense to me.
<Malavolent> Hypotetical question, do you think that female ponies with longer wings are considered more attractive?
<MadSurge> Those are some huge-ass wings o__o
<Radu> OH my... Dem wings
<TheRainbowDash> Woah, them wings....o_o
<TheRainbowDash> Geez...
<Twi_Fi> Hello MadSurge.
<Malavolent> You aren't jealous, are you, RD? :D
<teh_Tharassan> i think the wings are just about right :)
<MadSurge> Hey Twi_Fi!
<N4X> Malavolent : I guess it depends on your definition of "attractive"
<Malavolent> N4X: Well, attractive to stallions.
<N4X> It's not like every Stallion is as...fuck don't know how to say it in English...as desperatly horny as some other humans
<teh_Tharassan> -.-
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Uhhh, maybe I am jealous bro...:|
<N4X> Any German here that could help me?
<alexxm> hey Madsurge http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
<Om> N4X: Try google traslate?
<Om> Its not the best...
<alexxm> hey MadSurge http://www.flickr.com/photos/markluethi/5594972041/ i'll just leave this here
<N4X> It's a neologism I don't think it would work out pretty well
<Irish_Pony|Blind> N4X sexually atrracted?
<TheRainbowDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Uhh, I would think that also.
<Bronies4evar> Time is... 7:54 am.
<N4X> naw...notgeil a known term? I guess not huh?
<Malavolent> N4X: Got the same problem. I mean, male humans are attracted to females with larger breasts (true story), so stallions may or may not be attracted to females with longer wings.
<alexxm> whos N4X attracted to Irish_Pony|Blind
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: Stop leaving that picture here....:(
<N4X> The hell?!
<Radu> Wait, what
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, what?:D
<alexxm> what Twi_Fi
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: Dat statue
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: It scares me.....
<Irish_Pony|Blind> alexxm nopony, in fact i have no idea :P
<MadSurge> alexxm: that's a creepy statue :D and we didn't have Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood
<TheRainbowDash> I like how the wings are much taller than the pony's overall height.
<alexxm> sorry Twi_Fi
<Bronies4evar> 7:55 am. Show begins in five minutes.
<Twi_Fi> Do you think he can beat you in a race, TheRainbowDash ?
<Malavolent> TheRainbowDash: http://lifeofpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Bald-Eagle3.jpg
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Eh, not a chance!
<MadSurge> TheRainbowDash: it looks a bit out of proportions, doesn't it?
*alexxm hugs Twi_Fi sorry about the statute
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: :)
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: Oh wow, never thought of hawks also.
<Malavolent> Nature is funyn.
<MadSurge> ^
<alexxm> what do you think makes it creepy MadSurge
<TheRainbowDash> MadSurge: Much out of proportion. I don't even think that is possible.

<Malavolent> Bronies4evar: You're in serious need for your daily pony dose, aren't you?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Wrek: do u do any drawing requests?
<Bronies4evar> Don't get your hopes up. It already began. Right?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Wrek: cause i would love it if u drew dinky
<MadSurge> I know Jack Black is great friends with Foo Fighters' singer :D

<N4X> HUB?
<Malavolent> Guys don't beat me but I like the new Derpy voice better. Although the other features of her should remain the same.
<Bronies4evar> On The Hub.

<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Bronies4evar: for wut?
<Twi_Fi> Shane377_The_Alicorn: Not sure.
<alexxm> well to be fair Malavolent i heard the person who orignally voiced derpy thought she was a guy
<Bronies4evar> Sixty seconds until she may come back!
<Malavolent> Wrek: New wallpaper? That seducing Twi...
*Ninjazz sighs
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Wrek: have u drawn a dinky before?
<Om> Malavolent: Nah, the new voice is fine. Its the act of changing it that got everyone a bit edgey
<MadSurge> Malavolent: does the voice really matter? She was recognized by the show! :$
<Ninjazz> On this note I shall be getting to work on stuff.
<Bronies4evar> In thirty seconds, you will see if I am right.
<N4X> MadSurge : You mean WE were recognized by the show :D
<Malavolent> alexxm: Yep, she thought she voices a boy I think.
<Bronies4evar> 15 to go.
<RainbowAsh> With her new voice Derpy sounds just like a stereotypical stupid blonde.

<Malavolent> It fits her quite well.
<N4X> ...

<N4X> MysteryPony : Like a sir
<Malavolent> Wrek: I guess we all listen to mainstream.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> The only nightmare i fear is my ex girlfriend :P
<Bronies4evar> Five minutes after the scene, STILL no specific derpy info.
<TheRainbowDash> RainbowAsh: I am a hipster, and I do not approve of that.
<alexxm> was the name derpy mentioned TheRainbowDash
*MysteryPony drinks the whiskey, Like a sir!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Yes, it was the "new" derpy voice
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> is it high girl voice derpy or?
<N4X> ...
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Uhhh, I guess yes.
<Wrek> 05that means there's a less chacne peopel will recognize what i got planned
<Twi_Fi> Oh, did TheRainbowDash return?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> hey Twi_Fi
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Eeyup, with my noms.:)
<Bronies4evar> TRD: Censored or not?
<MadSurge> Wrek: is it a game?
<N4X> The changed derpy
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Wrek what? you planning to rape us with G3?
<Ninjazz|Work> Wrek... Marathon... All is clear.
<MysteryPony> Wrek: is it cake! i want cake!
<Twi_Fi> Hey Shane377_The_Alicorn.

<TheRainbowDash> Bronies4evar: Unforuantely, yes.
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> hey hey Twi_Fi
<Twi_Fi> Hey hey Shane377_The_Alicorn.
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash: so its retarded voice derpy
<N4X> YAY!
<Ninjazz|Work> Can I ruin the surprise, Wrek? :P
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377_The_Alicorn: Pretty much.
<RainbowAsh> TheRainbowDash, I am sorry if I have hurt your feelings, that wasn't my intention.
<MadSurge> Twi!
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash: wahh i want hte normal derpy
<ACS13123> Dat twilight...
<MysteryPony> The RP dont start til TheRainbowDash Walks in!
<N4X> awww
<Wrek> 05never
<Bronies4evar> Okay. I knew it was not going to happen. I just wanted to give people hope.
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> w8 so the the girl voice one is the uncensored or the censored?
<TheRainbowDash> MysteryPony: Awww snap! RP Dash is in the house!:D
<N4X> You are a good Brony Bronies4evar
<Malavolent> Why are you talking about Derpy all of sudden?
<N4X> Derpy is now canon
<MysteryPony> Malavolent: well cos derpy is a pony ofc
<RainbowAsh> Malavolent, because TLR is playing on the hub
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> w8 so the the girl voice one is the uncensored or the censored? TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: It is because of the episode that showed Derpy talk and what not, but it was censored. Some ponies in this chatroom do not have the channel.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Oh ho ho that slaps me on the knee!
<Bronies4evar> Still, was it the old scene or the new one.
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377_The_Alicorn: I am sorry to report that it is censored.
<Ninjazz|Work> -_-
<Malavolent> So, it's rerun of The Last Roundup?
<Wrek> 05some=majority
<Ninjazz|Work> They already showed the damn episode here...
<N4X> true...
<RainbowAsh> Shane377_The_Alicorn, the original had a deeper, somewhat slow voice. The new standard girly issue voice is the new one.
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash: so its the retard voice one not the girl voice?
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> ohhh ok
*Ninjazz|Work facehoofs
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377_The_Alicorn: Ummm, I have to check if the retarded one is the girl one, but most likely so.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> brb
<Bronies4evar> Okay. It was a long shot anyway. Let's just enjoy the AJ pony hour.
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> RainbowAsh: so the retarded one is the original
<N4X> Censored=new New= Girly Voice
<MadSurge> Bladdra :D
<N4X> right?
<MysteryPony> Svensker er så rare!!!
<RainbowAsh> Shane377_The_Alicorn, it's not that retarded, but in a nutshell, yes.
<Twi_Fi|Internethates> My chat derped.
<alexxm> MysteryPony: english do you speak it
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> any1 got utube link of new derpy ep ?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> RainbowAsh: its how i differentiate them
<MadSurge> Derpy is not retarded guys, stop dissing her
<MysteryPony> alexxm: Да, я делаю!
<Malavolent> As far as I know, there is the old voice (Where she sounds like a retard) and the new one (Where she has high voice).
<Twi_Fi> Who is dissing Derpy?
<Twi_Fi> WHO?
<N4X> Nopony should do it
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Wait, huh?
<TheRainbowDash> I am too busy nomming on stuff.
<N4X> But unforunatly some ponies did
<Mutterguy> TheRainbowDash, you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room. The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.
<Bronies4evar> It's over. Derpy is dead. Let's just hope for a derpy episode in Season 3.
<Ninjazz|Work> Among other things, Dashie.
<N4X> DUDE! Bronies4evar!
<Twi_Fi> Bronies4evar: :(
<Twi_Fi> Bronies4evar: :'(
<N4X> Derpy isn't dead she was in several other episodes even after the last roundup!
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TBH making derpy have that girly voice makes it seem worse cause derpy has blonde hair so yea
<TheRainbowDash> Mutterguy: Oh, what is that smell? (closes my nose, and I notice a small, but faint window in the far corner of the dark room, and one pony enters the room with me)
<N4X> For example a friend in deed (i think)

<Om> Derpy cant die. She was alive before she was even canon
<RainbowAsh> Shane377_The_Alicorn, ikr
<Bronies4evar> Talking derpy is never coming back. :(
<MadSurge> DERPY IS NOT DEAD. She's alive and well, it's just very unlikely she'll get another talking role
<MysteryPony> Bronies4evar: DONT SAY THAT! *starts Crying*
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> it seems they kinda MADE IT WORSE than better
<Malavolent> I'm confused.
<TheRainbowDash> MadSurge: Yeah, Derpy is not dead, obviously, whow would think that?
<Malavolent> What did happen?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> cause now its picking on blondes
<Vordox> Wrek, what'cha doing? =3
<N4X> Bucking fluff! Bronies4evar : Stop this nonesense it's helping no pony
<Wrek> 05setting up
<Bronies4evar> I said TALKING derpy, not derpy alltogeher.
<Vordox> D3?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> but tbh i dont really mind derpys new voice
<N4X> We don't know!
<Ninjazz|Work> If my predictions are correct, Wrek is about to show a classic.
<MadSurge> We got a whole fandom backing and loving Derpy, and the animators know that :)
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Wrek: have u or are u gonna draw a dink picture?
<MysteryPony> Wrek: why do you have swedish operating system?
<Bronies4evar> ****NO DERPY POSTS AFTER THIS LINE*******
<Cypresswolf> I stayed up half the night last night for a live stream on a game, only to fall asleep 20 minutes into it :P
<Vordox> I don't think Wrek can draw fillies that well. :)
<Bronies4evar> Because it's over.
<Vordox> Unless he proves me wrong atleast.
<TheRainbowDash> I do not care if Derpy's voice is changed, I just want her to remain of the same and orginal character that she was before.
<Ninjazz|Work> I know that feel, Cypresswolf.
<RainbowAsh> I do what I want. Derpy
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash: is such a derp-y pony
<valoreins> ohai bronystate! :D
<Radu> Dem Swedish folders
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> hey hey valoreins

<TheRainbowDash> Hello valoreins! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Vordox> MadSurge: Ayup

<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Vordox: lol
<Om> Even I would hug Derpy, and I despise hugs.
<Ninjazz|Work> I knew it.

<MadSurge> Where are all the enemies in this game? :D
<Om> Pew pew pew

<teh_Tharassan> The fun has been DOUBLED!!
<Cypresswolf> If I can get it to look better, I may eventually post it somewhere
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: No, it is not epic. I rather hate it.
<Kattchips-Pony> alexxm: Not bad.
<Bronies4evar> It's 8:30 am. The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is playing on the hub now.

<Om> I havent seen Avengers yet.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|Work: Oh, the New York marathon is in 2 weeks, and you still haven't completed it in over 15 years? Wow, you are sooo slow...:D
<N4X> It was a pest...
<valoreins> Loki=Discord? 6_9
<Ninjazz|Work> TheRainbowDash: O U. :D
<alexxm> it only took a month for people to be sick of them Twi_Fi
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|Work: Oh me...(smiles)
<N4X> Wasn't Loki actually a dwarf who fooled the gods...?
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash:
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> TheRainbowDash: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2479/
<Twi_Fi> I was scared when I kept seeing those Arrow in Knee jokes because I wasn't sure of the source and it seemed like everyone on youtube was making the same joke.
<Ninjazz|Work> I didn't know those soldiers could have Assualt Rifles...
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377_The_Alicorn: Ummm...o_o...there is the tag "rule 34" under it, maybe not so apporpiate in here.

<pikorar> Actually, I speak Boomhower English.
<GilDash> pikorar: I know British English... and that's it. :D
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Wow, really?:D
<morningburst> british english <3 the queens english and yeah
<Bronysith> GilDash: heres some drugged goodies
<pikorar> You mean Commonwealth English, GilDash? That's what it's called.
<Airpuff> GilDash: No other languages? xd
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Well, I'm learning American English too. :D
<WallDives> I am fluent in English, I know a little dutch and japanese.
<TheRainbowDash> Why is there different types of styles for one language anyway?
<Om> Bronysith: Where are you getting all thsese drugged items?
<WallDives> TheRainbowDash: regional dialects.
*Airpuff glares at GilDash ... american english -.-
*Bronysith drugs Om
<morningburst> American english don't bother
<GilDash> pikorar: I've never heard of it called that. :D
<valoreins> and don't forget Engrish!
<deadeagle> i come back to this
<Dermathil> Oh they took him.
<Dermathil> ffs.
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: Oh, forgot about accents of different people and what not.
*Om gets dizy and falls over
*Airpuff helps Om back up on his feet
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> TheRainbowDash: Cause each other things there own lanuage is better, duh...
*Kattchips-Pony eats a carrot
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> thinks*
<Om> @~@
<pikorar> GilDash: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Commonwealth_English that's the official name of it.
<WallDives> TheRainbowDash: right. in other languages, like Arabic, the differences in dialects is like the difference between Italian and French.
<valoreins> wat happen to the baby?
<GilDash> I'd like to learn Spanish, but I don't think I can be assed. :D
<TheRainbowDash> _xXiaoDrag0n_: Oh, yeah, forgot that too.
<morningburst> can someone tell me what is this were watching so interesting :)
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> Om its not nice to ask where people got their drugs just accept and say thank you
<Twi_Fi> :O <-- This doesn't adequately represent my shock!
<GilDash> pikorar: Oh, well everyone I know just calls it British English. The more you know!
<Airpuff> GilDash: You'll get far enough with english, dont mind learning any more xDD
<Om> [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: The hasent have it yet @~@
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: Hmm, I see. So only these dialects would apply to a language, if certain people in a region speak it. There is no such thing as American Madarin, right?
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> Twi_Fi: :)
<TheRainbowDash> (since not enough people speak it in America)
<Dermathil> French and English. Bilingual.
<pikorar> Well then, GilDash, you can impress all your British English friends with Commonwealth English.
<WallDives> TheRainbowDash: Mandarin is a headache all its own.
<GilDash> pikorar: And confuse them when I talk exactly the same how I do now. :D
<Kattchips-Pony> Im bilingual too.
<pikorar> Hey... Is there anyone here who is not a natural born English speaker who can answer a question for me?
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> Om what? :P
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> TheRainbowDash: Mandarin is a Chinese Dialect.
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: Oh, yeah, there is also another "Chinese" form of it, but I forgot what it was, but it is about all the same thing.
<prince-dari> How come there's a film on so early?
<Dermathil> Yes, Pikorar?
<Airpuff> ... you'know.. its kinda creepy that they think "god" justifyes their madness xD
<Dermathil> prince-dari: Ask Wrek
<Ninjazz|Work> Hey prince-dari.
<morningburst> what the films name i wanna know
<Dermathil> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837106/
<Twi_Fi> prince-dari: Early? :D
<morningburst> what is*
<TheRainbowDash> _xXiaoDrag0n_: Yeah, I know, I just wanted to know if there was other dialects for that specific language.
<Wrek> 05becasue swedish films are so bad they are good
<GilDash> Airpuff: Fanatics are of all breeds and faiths. They don't necessarily need a God to go to extreme lengths.
<pikorar> Demathil, all my friends claim that English is one of the hardest languages to learn, which I don't believe at all. Do you think English was a difficult language?
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello prince-dari! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<Dermathil> That would make it a B movie Wrek
<valoreins> nah this film is relevant to my interest
<IshBestPony> what are we watching?
<Dermathil> pikorar: it is actually one of the easiest languages on earth.
<Sundaysmile> And what film is this?
<morningburst> ^ this please! ish
<prince-dari> Hey, and good thanks TheRainbowDash, and yourself?
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> TheRainbowDash: Some chinese dialect I heard of are, Hokkien, Teochew, Mandarin, Cantonese
<CrazyCherry> pikorar: You should try to speak finnish... It's like japanese but backwards....
<Om> Languages are hard.
<Airpuff> GilDash: I guess... still.. Its redicolus
<pikorar> Thank you Dermathil. I now have two people telling me the same thing. English has so few rules it's easy to pick up.
<TheRainbowDash> prince-dari: Ah, doing very well. I am relaxed and what not, just enjoying my weekend, thanks for asking back.:)
<WallDives> CrazyCherry: that thought scares me.
<IshBestPony> I thought we we're done with movies for the week
<GilDash> Airpuff: Welcom to life. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash: Welcome to religion* I'd say. Bunch of nonsense -.-
<CrazyCherry> WallDives: :D :3
<GilDash> Airpuff: Additional "e"s in "Welcome" cost extra. :D
<Om> Oh god a wip
<Twi_Fi> :O
<IshBestPony> what are we watching?
<pikorar> Actually CrazyCherry, Acleps taught me a little Finnish, and I know how crazy it can be. But I'm taking French and that's already too much for my babby brain to handle.
<Twi_Fi> :O:O
<Om> RUN for the HILLS!
<Airpuff> xD GilDash
<GilDash> Airpuff: It's not always religion. Look at extremest movements in environment and such.
<pikorar> Can't tell if kinky or not...
<Dermathil> Pikorar: French is infinitely harder.
<IshBestPony> what are we watching?
<Twi_Fi> :O:O:O
<WallDives> IshBestPony: Arn.
<Wrek> 05S&M the medieval
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, hold up everypony, got to reboot my system, I'll be on right after I restart.
<Airpuff> GilDash: True. But look troughout world history.
<CrazyCherry> pikorar: Good for you! :D :3
<WallDives> so, is this castle Anthrax?
<Twi_Fi> Damn, that's loud.
<pikorar> Dermathil: Oh God yes... With the conjugatios and masculine/feminine... Man.
<Twi_Fi> ouch
<pikorar> :(
<Kattchips-Pony> Dayum.
<Dermathil> That's my natural born language btw.
<Twi_Fi> :(
<pikorar> :C I'm a sad panda.
<WallDives> pikorar: yes you are.
<Dermathil> And guys, the sound of a whip is caused by the whip going supersonic.
<Om> How kind the grace of god is. [sarcasm]
<Twi_Fi> pikorar: You're a panda?
<pikorar> Why do nuns have to be so cruel and unjust?
<GilDash> Airpuff: I know. That's because God and faith have always been amongst the most predominant issues. Now that more and more people do not believe you'll see others taking their place.
<Dermathil> pikorar: they are bitches that never got to get laid. Ever.
<morningburst> Cause god told them so i guess thats how they see it
<Sundaysmile> What movie is this?
<Princess_Cadence> Ello.
<morningburst> "god is loving but he also told me to whip you for speaking your mind"
<pikorar> They worship satan in their evil black garb and listen to their heavy metal at all hours of the night.
<IshBestPony> Wait, I thought we we're done with movies for the week
<Ninjazz|Work> Hey Princess_Cadence.
*Kattchips-Pony makes a poor attept at licking her elbow\
<pikorar> Hi Princess_Cadance! I love you!
<WallDives> IshBestPony: dont question it, just enjoy it.
<valoreins> i don't know about medieval christian until i see this... :s but is it really that accurate?
<Dermathil> Hey Prince_Dari
<Princess_Cadence> pikorar thank you
<Ninjazz|Work> To an extent, valoreins.
<Airpuff> GilDash: True. Still, the fact that as long as they did it in the name of god or as "god's will" earlier justified anything is just fucked up.
<prince-dari> Hey Dermathil
<pikorar> You should have seen the Spanish Inquisition valoriens. Much worse.
<Wrek> 05the master nun being a bitch? probably not accurate
<Dermathil> how are you man?
<Wrek> 05in general
<prince-dari> Not bad thanks, you?
*Princess_Cadence is so worried that sweats
<GilDash> Airpuff: Also true, but people can go to absurd lengths in "justifying" their actions.
<alexxm> hey prince-dari hows your day been
<Dermathil> I'm feeling okay. Bit depressed here and there, but cool.
<Princess_Cadence> :S will it happen? : S :S
<prince-dari> alexxm: So far there hasn't been much of it. :P
<pikorar> Aw, why Dermathil? You can talk about it!
*Kattchips-Pony falls over
<morningburst> i magnus a brand of condom her ein america .-.
<morningburst> here-
<GilDash> Dermathil: Aww, I don't like depressed ponies. :(
<morningburst> isnt-
<Princess_Cadence> will it happen?!?! :S :S :S *sweats*
<Airpuff> GilDash: yeah yeah, true. But religion has always been one of the first "legitimate" reasons.
<valoreins> everypony vote: swords or guns?
<Om> Dermathil: I hope you find some solace in being here at bronystate.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hiya everypony!
<morningburst> swords please
<GilDash> Airpuff: *Sigh* Yeah... :(
<Ninjazz|Work> hey TheMonstaMuffin.
<WallDives> valoreins: swords take more skill, but guns are quicker, and get the job done.
<prince-dari> INB4 Armand dies
<Airpuff> :P
<Princess_Cadence> hi themonstamuffin
<Twi_Fi> Hello prince-dari, Princess_Cadence, and TheMonstaMuffin.

<Twi_Fi> Greetings PrincessLuna.
<Princess_Cadence> wrek lol
<GilDash> Airpuff: I just don't like people saying religion is the root of all wars and the like. Just like how I don't like saying all bronies are attracted to horses or whatnot.
<pikorar> HO HO HO! La Francais mustache!

*PrincessLuna pokes GilDash
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Work: For what? :S
<Wrek> 05i would definetly be religious if it meant being a paladin
<Wrek> 05;3
<Airpuff> GilDash: I understand that, but if you look objectively at it... it is one of the main reasons to many wars and alot of suffering -.-
<valoreins> and templars being jerks, is that historically accurate too? :s
<Wrek> 05a giant hammer and the holy light is all i need
<alexxm> hey PrincessLuna hows your day been (hugs her)
<Princess_Cadence> i knew it i knew i just kneew itt
<Ninjazz|Work> Your statement earlier to Airpuff, not alot of sense is made in these days.
<pikorar> I would worship shruberies to be a knight of ni.
<Sundaysmile> And no sins of the flesh either Wrek
<GilDash> Airpuff: No, people abusing power is. Religion is a justification and a scapegoat, nothing more.
<Wrek> 05valoreins: you mistake the templar beign a jerk with the MAN being aj erk
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hey this is 'Arn' isent it?
<WallDives> valoreins: probably, since all templars are are knights, and historically, they're just as prickish as lords.
<PrincessLuna> alexxm: Well I'm just finishing my coffee but good :)
<valoreins> okay
<Princess_Cadence> bad news.i will be gone until its june 5th.

<Dermathil> Lord: THat'S because the main assets are serverside. That way they can't pirate the fullgame.

<Bronysith> alexxm: one giant murder simulateor
<Om> GilDash: I can be a tad careless at times...
<Om> Airpuff: Epic?
<alexxm> sounds good Bronysith
<Meanwhile> It's a series of tubes.

<Om> PrincessLuna: That face will give me nightmares
<pikorar> I read the rules.
<Meanwhile> http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<TheRainbowDash> Om: A: I love RP. B: Better when a lot of ponies are involved. C: The topic...:D
<Princess_Molestia> I SHALL FETCH A RUG
<Dermathil> Meanwhile, check the nospam section. RP is classified as spam in there.
<Airpuff> Yeah Om.. nightmares ;)
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: what are u doing
*Om shivers
<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: Make sure it's shagpile. :)
<Meanwhile> If there's anyone in here who you don't need to relay the rules to Dermathil, it's me.
*Princess_Molestia drugs GilDash
<Dermathil> hehehee
<valoreins> brb in a minute
<rdibp> what game is this
<pikorar> Oh Meanwhile, at least try being modest.
<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile bends the rules a little bit.
<Meanwhile> Modesty implies ability.
<pikorar> rdibp: Deus Ex, something something.
<Om> TheRainbowDash: Wait...You prefer. More people? Absurd!
<teh_Tharassan> -.-
<Meanwhile> Short of my ability to read, there isn't really much to be proud of about the rules.
<Dermathil> Meanwhile, you aren't the one RPing all the time.
<TheRainbowDash> Om: Yeah, more ponies is better.
*Princess_Molestia drugs everything in Meanwhile s household
<Meanwhile> >_>
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Yeah, that belongs to me to do that job.:D
*Om TheRainbowDash's logic does not compute
<Dermathil> TheRainbowDash: don't spam too much then. RP is classified as spam.
<GilDash> Om: The more the merrier. ;)
<pikorar> Then it needs not to be brought up, Meanwhile. -.-
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Yeah, I was crazy with RP before, but I keep it limited now.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Indeed :P
<Litwick> Is anypony in need of a hug today?
<PrincessLuna> Dermathil: Excessive RP is classified as spam 6_9
*Princess_Molestia hugs Litwick
<pikorar> I would like a hug, Litwick.
<Om> GilDash: What if your on a sinking ship. Like this chat.
<pikorar> Behind you!
<TheRainbowDash> Hugs are good.:)
*GilDash hugs Litwick.
<pikorar> Guard!
<Meanwhile> pikorar: I'm failing to understand exactly what you're trying to get across here.
<Dermathil> PrincessLuna: we have a bit too much RP still.
<GilDash> Om: Then we abandon ship for safer waters. ;)
*Litwick hugs Princess_Molestia, pikorar, GilDash, and TheRainbowDash.
<pikorar> It's nothing Meanwhile, forget it.
<TheRainbowDash> That means technically, I was breaking the rules all of the time before.:D
<Princess_Molestia> I MUST BE OFF to get the others
<Meanwhile> Forget what?
<TheRainbowDash> With the RP and what not.
*Om abandons ship
<Bronysith> bye Princess_Molestia
*Airpuff jumps on Om's lifeboat
<TheRainbowDash> Bye Princess_Molestia! (waves and hugs)
*pikorar does RP on chat.
<Om> I don't have a lifeboat...
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash, whassup dawg? :D
<PrincessLuna> :o
<pikorar> Yo dawg I heard you like RP so I RP about playing RP so I can RP while I RP.
*Airpuff giggles at Om "You're the lifeboat, silly" ;)
<Dermathil> Had I been picked for moderator 9 months ago, I would've made a pretty strict mod.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Oh, you know. The usual. ;)
<Meanwhile> Tragically you weren't.
*Om drowns
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Yeah, and I would be banned immedaitely for my antics.
<Bronysith> if i was a mod
<MadSurge> GilDash: messing with chat denizens?
<Bronysith> wed be ded
*Om reconsiders his actions and does not drwon
*Airpuff lifts om up into the air and back onto the shit with magic =3
<GilDash> pikorar: I've done that before. So many times. My brackets were like: (( (( (( Stuff. )) )) ))
<Dermathil> not banned. You'd get a warning kick somewhere inbetween.

<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith: Oh, ok...:D
<Airpuff> Its not a bad question unless you think of it that way Om =O
<Dermathil> Eh. I'm happy not to be a mod though. I can do almost anything without being weighted down by useless paperwork.
<MadSurge> GilDash: I never drink btw, I'm just insane like that on my own :D
<TaviChaser> Hi Kids!
<PrincessLuna> And in the left corner we have Meanwhile, weighing in at 150 jiggawatts. And in the right corner we have Dermathil weighing in at 120 jiggaflops....FIGHT *DING*
<Bronysith> TaviChaser: hiya
*Bronysith hands TaviChaser tea
<Om> Airpuff: Safty first, think of the worst and hope for the best.
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Eh, the work is good enough for me. If there was a mod position open right now, I would go straight for it.
<Meanwhile> PrincessLuna: What on earth is a jiggaflop.
<Airpuff> Om to think you would think such Om.... not bad...
<GilDash> MadSurge: I'm fairly mad. When I drink everyone seems to have such a good time though. :D
<PrincessLuna> Meanwhile: I dunno, just sounded cool 6_9
<sonicrainboomer259> let me guess..........DEUS EX!!!
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<WallDives> I've been a mod, although not here. Been a admin, again, not here.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I drink all of the time, thank Celestia.:D
<TaviChaser> ....no one knows im Flare? :|
<Bronysith> TaviChaser: i know flare
<TaviChaser> I can abuse this! :D
<WallDives> TaviChaser: I know who you are.
<TaviChaser> crap.
<Om> Airpuff: ...I-...Damit.
<Dermathil> TheRainbowDash: I am friends with a few people who got depressed and had to quit their positions.
<Bronysith> TaviChaser: molestia is looking for u
*Airpuff giggles at Om
<TaviChaser> Bronysith: D:
<TheRainbowDash> TaviChaser: I didn't know you were Flare.
<GilDash> WallDives: I've been a mod. Don't know if I could be one here with what I do. I wouldn't want to tone it down. :D
<MadSurge> GilDash: and you DO sound like a fun guy to hang around with :D
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Oh, I see....hmm...
<Airpuff> GilDash: xDD
<sonicrainboomer259> him is the best cartoon/anime villian of all time since cell and buu
<PrincessLuna> Hey guys, while we're here discussing what would've happened if we were mods, lets talk about what would've happened if Hitler had won the war :P
<GilDash> MadSurge: Well, I'm shier in IRL, but get to know me and I'l just as fun. :)
<teh_Tharassan> i need to glomp somepony
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Don't talk about the war! :D
<Airpuff> lol PrincessLuna xDD
*Bronysith glomps teh_Tharassan
<Dermathil> I'm meeting those persons at Bronycon in 6 weeks.
<Om> I could not mod, chat moves to fast.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I still remember the first time I met you, in that Rainbow Dash room one day, and well, you and several others, you know...*winks*:D
<WallDives> GilDash: I'd have to separate duty and fun, like I did then. too bad the sites went down on both occasions.
<sonicrainboomer259> thats not even funny,PrincessLuna
<MadSurge> GilDash: apparently it's the same for me :)
<Meanwhile> PrincessLuna: if that were the case you would have said "Let's talk about what would've happened if the allies won the war"
<teh_Tharassan> :D
<PrincessLuna> Meanwhile: ....touche
<PrincessLuna> Meanwhile: xD
<Meanwhile> touché
<Meanwhile> Dat RainBroDash.

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: tocuhes all teh ponies
<PrincessLuna> Meanwhile: I'm not sure of that alt code for that e T_T
*Airpuff noms some icecream =3
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Oh, those were the good times.

<Om> Meanwhile: Some people cant type the fancy e
<sonicrainboomer259> ok,i'll blame canada,ON ONE CONDITION!!!
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Yeah, he got permanently banned.:D
<Radu> Wat http://i.imgur.com/tjBxD.jpg
*Dermathil punches sonicrainboomer259
<Meanwhile> Some people clearly need a better handle on their keyboards.
<GilDash> WallDives: No, Canada was a member I met the first day I stopped lurking.
<WallDives> ah.
<TaviChaser> Radu: its true.
<Bronysith> nice Radu
<TheRainbowDash> Radu: wow, 100% correct, right on the hay.
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: That's because he didn't know when to stop. :D
<PrincessLuna> GilDash: Who :o
<sonicrainboomer259> :'( WHY U HIT ME!?
<Dermathil> Who the hell is trying to blame my country for their shit as usualy?
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I knew when to stop, after I got warned and kicked a few times.
<Bronysith> TheRainbowDash: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1116/
<Airpuff> GilDash: Some guy pulling it a bit too far? xD
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: I don't know. I only met him for about 4-5 hours. :(
<Radu> Bronysith: LOL
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: Theere was some guy who got banned, name's Canada.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith: Wow, that actually creeps me out a bit...:S
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> The a-hole had to tarnish my country. Wow.
<PrincessLuna> Someone is a bit touchy today 6_9
<Meanwhile> I don't think I've ever actually met anyone who's cared about Canada the country in any degree.
<TaviChaser> last time I will be posting this, CHECK IT NOW! http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/#/d50iyma
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4697/
<GilDash> Airpuff: Yeah, but keeping it all on Mane chat. To be honest, I didn't see him say any worse than I have done, but he might've done something bad after I legt.
<GilDash> *left
<Dermathil> Meanwhile: YOU'VE GOT ONE IN YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW
<Meanwhile> Usually people blame either terrorism or America.
<TheRainbowDash> Dermathil: Yeah, I talked and chatted with him, good times back in the day, and then he got out of control,a dn got a permanent ban, oh well.
<pikorar> Okay... So my computer just crashed. Bad. I actually never had a system crash before... But I got the black screen of death.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: facefaceface
<Meanwhile> Faic.
<Airpuff> Ahahaha GilDash sounds interesting xD
<PrincessLuna> Dermathil: It's ok, people bash my country all the time :) (America)
<Dermathil> PrincessLuna: its not the same, your country deserves it a wee bit more.
<Radu> Flarechaser
<GilDash> Airpuff: That's how me and PONY/pony_zen met. :)
<MadSurge> Hehe, dat Octavia :D
<Airpuff> xD
<PrincessLuna> Dermathil: Well if we got into who's country deserved it more it would be a pointless conversation going nowhere fast ;)
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Yeah, those good old days back in March and early April 2012, the Canada, excesive RP, pomfing, wubbing days.:D
<Meanwhile> Yeah Canada's never really been anything to the rest of the world besides America's hat. And a place with a lot of moose.
<Meanwhile> Are there really a lot of moose in Canada?
<Dermathil> Meanwhile: Vimy.
<Dermathil> yes.
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: ahahahaha xD
<Meanwhile> Sweet. I want to see a moose.
<Radu> Canada, eh? Why are we talking about Canada?
<Om> TheRainbowDash: The chat used to be worse than it is now?
<WallDives> Om: yes.
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: It ws good times, while it lasted, and it still is today, not the pomfing and all that, but still good to hang out around here.
<pikorar> Hi Radu, I love you!
<PrincessLuna> Om: Yush
<Dermathil> Vimy and The Devil's Brigade in WW2 beg to differ about us not doing anything ever.
<Radu> Hi pikorar, I love you too! :3
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: I guess x)
<Radu> But why is that, pikorar?:O
*Om is now slightly mortified
<Meanwhile> America on the other hand is a narcissistic flag waving douchebag who won't sit down and shut up.
<Bronysith> PONOIES
<TaviChaser> ...we need more ponies.
<Radu> Dat PONOIES
<pikorar> Radu: because I just love you.
<Dermathil> WE BURNT THE WHITE HOUSE DOWN ONCE
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Not on Mane chat, but on #Rainbow_dash it happens every so often. :D
<Meanwhile> It's hard not to dislike America tbh.
*Airpuff kisses Om "You know you like it?" ;)
<TheRainbowDash> Om: Yeah, when I first joined here, I got thrown into insanity, excesive RP, chat rape, shutdown of chatrooms, man, good mayhem.
<WallDives> Dermathil: again, without Canadians liberating the netherlands, I wouldnt exist, so I'm grateful.
<Litwick> Meanwhile: Damn straight.
<Radu> pikorar: I love you too. :3
<Dermathil> indeed
<pikorar> Dermathil: We blew up two cities with nuclear bombs once.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Oh yeah, it was the Rainbow Dash when that happened.
<Om> Airpuff: No, I don't.
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: You know, I've only been kicked once since I've been here. Warned a couple of times, but only kicked once. :)
*alexxm ruffles TheRainbowDash s mane
<PrincessLuna> pikorar: lmaoooo
<Dermathil> pikorar: were these american cities? OWAIT
<Airpuff> Ahahah Om x)
<Radu> nom nom
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Kicked a thousand times for message spam, nothing too serious though.:D
<Om> TheRainbowDash: That is unfortunet. Mybe not for you.
<Meanwhile> It doesn't really help your case when the best thing you can bring to your countries defence is the number of people it's killed in one shot.
<PrincessLuna> Dermathil: Nope, Japanese
<Dermathil> I KNOW
<pikorar> Dermathil: I live in America, why would we blow up our cities?
<TaviChaser> lolwut
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Never for spam, just for, I guess, "inappropriate content." :D
<Meanwhile> Chill out Dermathil.
<Lighty> 06proITsolution:
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Well, it was both/.
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: I've gotten kkicked for message spam myself some times.. and once for trolling T.T

<FlareChaser> Thats our Wrek!!
<FlareChaser> *laughter*
<PrincessLuna> Hey guys, did anyone see what I did there? Saying how people trash talk America all the time and it turned into a rage chat? 6_9 Almost as bad as starting a political/religion discussion
<Om> Airpuff: You are a troll >.>
<Meanwhile> Nothing like the fresh taste of trains.
<Dermathil> Best way for me to chill out.
<Meanwhile> I like trains.
<Radu> FlareChaser, wasn't Colgate your waifu? Now it's Octavia?

<GilDash> Airpuff: Some weirdo?

<GilDash> pikorar: Wait, who's this now?
<Airpuff> Yay! Meanwhile guessed it xD I was starting to get worried
<TheRainbowDash> Om: It already has, too late.
<pikorar> GilDash: Just a really funny YouTube commentator named Criken2.
<GilDash> Airpuff: I knew, but you're still a weirdo.
<GilDash> pikorar: Oh, okay.
<Radu> Meanwhile, how did you caption that?
<Meanwhile> This looks like a job for Sumerpan.
<Meanwhile> Radu: With words.

<Radu> Oh, it's okay.
<GilDash> pikorar: Good show, my good sir.
<TheRainbowDash> Who is the weirdest one here? That has to be me.:D
<Radu> Wish I knew
*WallDives yawns
<Airpuff> Om: aww thanks =3

<Om> I'm normal.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Oi!
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Nah, Meanwhile is just boring. :D
<LittleBrony> :D
<WallDives> Om: lies and hearsay.
<Meanwhile> What.
<TheRainbowDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: No, not even him. I am currently sane. Do not see me when I am insane and super silly.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ohai
<Meanwhile> ;n;
<GilDash> Meanwhile: :p
<icybeauti> Hi guys. Sorry I haven't been on in a while.
<Om> WallDives: Tis the truth!
*Meanwhile bonks GilDash in the head with a cinderblock.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> TheRainbowDash: Not as silly as SuperBrony64
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: We don't, because you get kicked. :D
<pyrocatboy> ded
<WallDives> Om: you're here. that disqualifies you from normalcy.
<pikorar> Hi icybeauti! I forgive you just as much as I love you. And that's a lot.
<valoreins> i'm baack
<Meanwhile> Allo icybeauti.
<Jim> BronyState™ Sanity sold separately
<Radu> pikorar, since when you started loving everyone so much?:D
<icybeauti> pikorar: I've been busy. Hey Meanwhile
<pikorar> Welcome back valoriens!
<TheRainbowDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Oh, right, forgot abouyt him. I am his second in command of the Sillines Department, right in 2nd place.:)
<WallDives> hi icybeauti.
<icybeauti> Hey WallDives
*pyrocatboy glomps Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Your chat is deeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
<pikorar> Since ever, Radu.
<Om> WallDives: No, it just means...That...uh. I'm normal
<Jim> hi valoreins and icybeauti
*Meanwhile is hit by a low flying pyrocatboy.
<icybeauti> Heya Jim
*Airpuff stares at Om.... "You're normal?"
<TheRainbowDash> Hello, well everypony that is coming into here!
<WallDives> Om: again, LIES. and I dont think GilDash lieks normal people.
<Om> Airpuff: Yes.
*pyrocatboy nuzzles Meanwhile
*Airpuff giggles at Om ... If you say so
<GilDash> WallDives: I have very broad tastes. :)
<LordCelestia> 0,5Meanwhile is eating it!
<Om> WallDives: Then I am VERY normal
<WallDives> Lies, hearsay, damn lies and Shenanigans.
<LordCelestia> 0,5And then he's gonna eat me!
<pikorar> Om, nobody is normal. Some people are just more normal than others.
<Meanwhile> Oh my goooooooooood.
<Jim> What's normal?
<icybeauti> I'm not doing a stupid question, but what exactly is normal? Who defines it?
<GilDash> Om: That won't save you. ;)
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Ni!
<LordCelestia> 0,5OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODNESS
<Om> Damn
<pikorar> Ni!
<TheRainbowDash> Define normal anypony.
<Meanwhile> lol
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: IT!
<Airpuff> No om, you are but "VERY"
<Jim> What's home?
<Om> TheRainbowDash: Me.
<Jim> What're cows?
<Radu> MOO
<pikorar> No GilDash! It hurts!
<TheRainbowDash> Om: Bullshit, try again.
<Airpuff> Om = Not normal, just "very"
*Irish_Pony|Blind screeches at GilDash
<pikorar> Oh no GilDash, I just said it!
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: What the majority subscribe to at any given time.
<icybeauti> Normal sucks, whatever it is.
<WallDives> Normal is a subjective baseline. No one is normal, just like no one is perfect.
<pikorar> No, I just said it again GilDash. UGH! No!
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Eh, that is close enough for me.
<Meanwhile> True fact.
<GilDash> pikorar: That's 3 times now. :D
<Jim> We could talk about normal until the cows come home
*pyrocatboy nuzzles Meanwhile
<valoreins> so... normal=perfect? :\
<Om> I'm normal, and everyone else is weird.
*Irish_Pony|Blind noms on GilDash's mane
<Meanwhile> I do not nuzzle. >_>
<pikorar> Om, you're kind of a jerk... :C
<icybeauti> In our soceitym there are different definitions of "normal" But they are dumb and will turn all of us into clones if we follow it.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> XD
*Airpuff stares at Om before giving him a hug "You live a hard life here"
<TheRainbowDash> I guess you can say that valoreins, only in specific situations though. Normal is one of those abstract words.
<WallDives> icybeauti: yay, logic!
<Meanwhile> Dat attempt to throw the guy over the side.
<Ninjazz|Work> Om: I try not be normal. But I usually return back to normal.
*pyrocatboy nuzzles Meanwhile anyway

<Jim> SuperBrony64: Shoo bee MOO, shoo shoo bee MOO
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's exactly like MW3? :O
<SayWhat> SuperBrony64: Hack and Slash
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: You wanted my server didn't you? Do you just want an amory link instead?

*Invi hugwubbles VioletGreySha
<Om> Ninjazz|Work: No really. I am perfectly abnormal
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: Sounds like it to me :/
<CK|Ded> You run around, kill things, then kill bigger things, and then win
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: http://derpy.me/dZyAw
<Trix> Is the game good?
*VioletGreySha hugs Invi back
<Ninjazz|Work> Om: If you say so.
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: i think it has some puzzles
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's why I was so into this game! It's like CoD!
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: I'm clicking it but nothing is happening.
<Athgaar> multiple shot lightning enchanted
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a dungeon crawling game
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: nvm :3
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: Clearly you're a bad person.
<Trix> Is Diablo 3 good?
<Athgaar> you tell us
<TaviChaser> Scoot-Scootaloo: comparing CoD to Diablo? ARE YOU INSANE?
<Meanwhile> For only the truly righteous can see my links.
<Jim> Meanwhile: Smexxy gear
<SayWhat> Dat whelp smash
<CK|Ded> Destructable terrain? Okay, that's a good addition.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll say the previous two are more worth your time
<WallDives> Meanwhile: something is wrong then, caise I can click it.
<Om> If your hatered is to low, does that mean you love everything?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Ninjazz|Work> Or not enough fucks to give.
<Meanwhile> My hatred is never too low.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: I still need to get my Bloodfang Pants :P
<Wrek> 05oh look
<CK|Ded> Plot exposition?
<Wrek> 05one of the secrent pony level items
<Jim> Oh my oh my

<Meanwhile> O rly?
<TaviChaser> nice.
<Ninjazz|Work> Whats it called?
<Bjornfot> Wrek, you steaming? YOU GOING TO THE PONY LEVEL? :D
<CK|Ded> I've seen the pony level. It's....magical.
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's funny how you call it Pony level when there's also carebears and flower and other stuff
<CK|Ded> KILL HIM
<Radu> What's so awesome with the pony level. It's not a FiM reference, big deal
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Interesting game music
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: RP server? :P
<cachi01> yeah magical..... CK|Ded
<pony_7879a> Oh no that's not the game music lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64: it's Wrek's own music
<CK|Ded> Radu: The elites have FiM-based names. >_>
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: I originally moved there with friends whom I no longer talk to.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh ><
<Ninjazz|Work> CrimsonPhoenix: When you have elite bosses called Nightmarity and Midnight Sparkle, I think you can call it a pony level.
<Radu> CK, like?
<Jim> CK|Ded: Like?
<Radu> Oh my.
<CK|Ded> Nightmarity.
<cachi01> Radu: well colored ponies and unicorns..... a strange cupcake referece (everytime u kill a pony u get a cupcake) and rainbows everywhere
<Ninjazz|Work> Get it?
<Airpuff> Not enough hatred? xD
<Jim> Haha, that's great
<FrankTheShyGuy> Hello.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: why dont switch to Durotan?
<CK|Ded> And there were a few others I can't recall off the top of my head, but they were all definitely FiM sounding.
<Wrek> 05once my main character has all the items and shit
<WallDives> hi FrankTheShyGuy.
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: Because I have a guild.
<Wrek> 05yes i will stream the secrent pony level
<Invi> wohoo
<Radu> dun dun dunn
<FrankTheShyGuy> How are you WallDives?
<Athgaar5> a
<Radu> b
<Invi> c
<Om> One would think hatred as a unreliable source
<Athgaar5> q
<Radu> d
<Bjornfot> Wrek: How long will it take to get all those items?
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: give it to somepony
<WallDives> FrankTheShyGuy: okay.
<CK|Ded> But it is fair to say the level wasn't originally an FiM joke, yes.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So, is this an MMORPG?
<Jim> not really
<CK|Ded> SB: Yes and no.
<WallDives> SuperBrony64: kinda, but not.
<Ninjazz|Work> Sort of. :S
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: I'm not the GM, but it'd be rude of me to up and leave it.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: ...
<Radu> Diablo 3 is multiplayer?
<WallDives> sorry for being vague.
<Radu> Oh pony, didn't know that
<Ninjazz|Work> Coop.
<Bjornfot> SuperBrony64: No, it's a single or multiplayer game that requires you to be logged in even if you're playing single player.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But what's the advantage of that?
<Meanwhile> You don't progress heroic DS with a guild then leave it. Unless you're a douche.
<CK|Ded> Radu: The game is always online, and the single player has an option to allow friends to join your gams.
<CK|Ded> *games
<Athgaar5> does he have infinite arrows?
<Jim> SuperBrony64: So that people won't hack it
<Airpuff> SuperBrony64: That is the ultimate question.. xD
<CK|Ded> Ergo yes, it's multiplayer moreso than single.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: did you JUST switch factions?
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: I've been Alliance for about a year.
<Om> Its an MSRPG (Masivly Singleplayer Role Playing Game)

<Acleps> What are we watching?
<WallDives> D3.
<Jim> Acleps: Diablo 3
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: And you were making fun of me for saying it was WoW. :p
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: You're a bad person.
<Acleps> WallDives, Jim: Thanks :)
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: well Wow does atleast have QUESTS! xD
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: I AM SO NAUGHTY
<TaviChaser> wait, what.
<Meanwhile> TaviChaser: Not really. You're kind of a jerk.
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: anyways, tell me an leveling-game that does not have the same concept? -.-
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Judging from the giant exclamation points above the quest-giving NPCs, so does D3.
<TheRainbowDash> And back after my noms.
<TaviChaser> Meanwhile: ...aw...
<Om> CK|Ded: Cant be xD
<Athgaar3_> god this chat is buggy
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: GW2?
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: And yes, I had more toast.:D
<Acleps> Athgaar3: What do you mean?
<Ninjazz|Work> wb, Dashie.
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Thats the way games work no matter what. The diffrence between these games and others though, is that others acctually have some sort of challange related tot hem lol
<TaviChaser> ...I'm just gonna go play TF2 now... to wipe away mah tears :|
<Meanwhile> Have fun TaviChaser.
<Athgaar3_> I keep disconnecting for no clear reason
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, alright then TaviChaser. Hope you fail.
*Airpuff stares at TheRainbowDash ..... "you never get tired of those now do ya?"
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: GW2 still has quests, it's just more than you run into them. But it. :p
<Acleps> Athgaar3_: Are you using tha flash version? It seems to work better for me..
<CK|Ded> *it's a better experience IMO.
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Eeyup, toast never gets old.
<TaviChaser> TheRainbowDash: I hope you die.
<Invi> Airpuff is there already a release date for GW2?
<TheRainbowDash> TaviChaser: Hahaha, you too.:D
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Same concept.
<Athgaar3_> I outright can't use the flash version
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Only in the loose sense of "there are quests"
<Airpuff> Invi: dont ask me xDD Im not the oen talkin about it xD
<Acleps> Athgaar3_: Why :O?
<GilDash> Acleps: Holla! :)
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: They function nothing alike.
<Om> TheRainbowDash: I keep my tast with variance by alternating peanut butter Nutella and cream cheese
<Invi> Airpuff ok ok sorry
<Athgaar3_> Acleps: It just flat out doesn't work.
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: how come?
<Om> taost damit!
<WallDives> GilDash: oh, you're still alive.

<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Because they're all 100% optional, save for the personal story. :p
<Acleps> Athgaar3_: Oh... :(
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: And even that is easy to skip, actually....
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: same is for example world of warcraft, on top they have like 15 zones you can level in not much diffrence.
<Jim> I'm going to play the shit out of GW2
<GilDash> I'm here, but busy. NOT what you're all thinking, honest. :)
<Conyst> Chaingun Bow
<Om> GilDash: Really.
<WallDives> sure, GilDash, sure.
<Athgaar3_> there is always enough hatred
<legacyofvrak> OK... I'm just gonna play Vagrant Story
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Like I said, if you're arguing the statement that "there are quests", fine, they're the same. That's ALL that remains similar between them.
<GilDash> Actually I'm discussing novel ideas. None of them involving what you're thinking. :D
<Acleps> GilDash: Then what? :)
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: All games which has leveling involved has the same setup, you can decide to do quests or grind you way up in level, how you obtain the quests make no diffrence.
<Meanwhile> Fire ALL the goddamn arrows!
<Om> GilDash: Okie dokie loki....
<Ninjazz|Work> I don't believe you, GilDash.
<Acleps> GilDash: New novel ideas? sounds interesting...
<TheRainbowDash> Hmm, ideas I see.
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Yeah, it kinda does.
<WallDives> GilDash, I'd say I believe you, but I dont like lying.
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: The experience is entirely different. :P
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Work: You wouldn't. :D But it's true.
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Guess i can agree there.
<legacyofvrak> Who's playing right now?
<Wrek> 05rain in a few
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Share some of these dieas with me.
<CK|Ded> ....oh, right, stomach is reminding me I haven't eaten. O.o
<GilDash> WallDives: Honest truth. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a cupcake in my eye.
<Athgaar3_> twilight is watching
<Ninjazz|Work> How true can you be?
<legacyofvrak> ok
<GilDash> I should just start a damned chatroom for this. :D
<legacyofvrak> Who's playing
<WallDives> GilDash: if you say so.
*Airpuff sticks a cupcake in GilDash 's ear
<MadSurge> Hey I'm still here :D Did you miss me?
<Om> GilDash: Well, I suppose we have to belive it from a pinkie promise
<legacyofvrak> ....
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Exactly. I am a fic writer too, so....share one ideas that you have so far.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Stop it, I'm trying not to break a Pinkie Promise here. You're not helping. :D
<legacyofvrak> SKYPE
<cachi01> I... MUST ... SE THE NAM
*Conyst gives GilDash more cupcakes
<WallDives> ok, so I thought I was pretty god at Starfox 64. And now I'm watching videos. HOLY SHIT I SUCK.
*Airpuff looks sad at GilDash "Owkai" :'(
<Radu> Fun fact: Skype rearranged is Spyke
<WallDives> good^
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: It just took me 10 minutes to get all of them across to pikorar. If you want me to go again, then just no. :D
<Radu> Sorry WallDives
<legacyofvrak> I'm just gonna play on 25 of May
<Om> WallDives: I know that feel
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Setup a chatroom and I'll do so. :)
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Wait, huh?
<Meanwhile> Radu: it's also Keyps.
<legacyofvrak> because i don't need to go to school
<SayWhat> :D
<Meanwhile> Mud Keyps.
<Radu> Keyps? What does Keyps mean?
<SayWhat> I WISH I STILL PLAYED WOW
<Radu> Oh

<Radu> Mud Keyps :D
<Meanwhile> So I heard you like mudkeyps.
<Airpuff> SayWhat: No you dont.
<Acleps> SayWhat: Then why won't you?
<SayWhat> You're right
<Athgaar3_> so someone's got a favourite pony
<WallDives> I hate being so competitive. now I have to study.
<legacyofvrak> Nope... I'm just gonna play Vagrant stoty
<SayWhat> WoW destroyed me
<legacyofvrak> story
<Airpuff> Athgaar3_: ... dont.. get us in on that..
<legacyofvrak> From PS1
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Mind, I'm not saying the typical quest system is bad, only that D3's new system is intended to model that of WoW. :p
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Invite everypony else who cares about this stuff as well if you're setting one up.
<Acleps> SayWhat: that's what it does :D
<legacyofvrak> (EPIK GAME)
<legacyofvrak> I hate WoW
<Athgaar3_> Airpuff: I was referring to his background, Firefox skin, etc
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Oh, ummm, fuck, I need to work on my story too, umm, and I probably need to go anyway in a few hours.
<MadSurge> GilDash, good job. I'm not confident enough in my writing to come up with fanfics :D
<Athgaar3_> Airpuff: Twilights everywhere
<legacyofvrak> sorry about that... i just hate it
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Well.. that us pretty much the standard questsystem in all games thoguh.. go to a npc recieve a quest deliver and repeat...
<Airpuff> Athgaar3_: ahaha okei
<Meanwhile> You're entitled to hate whatever you want to legacyofvrak.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Neither am I. I JUST DON'T STOP WITH THE IDEAS. :[
<Meanwhile> As long as you're civil about i.
<legacyofvrak> I prefer playing Half Life, Crysis, Portal, Minecraft or even my 93 PSX games
<Meanwhile> it*
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Sort of. The WoW structure emphasizes this in certain ways, though, methods that became staples in virtually every MMO since.
<Acleps> legacypfvrak: You've got a nice taste in games :)
<Om> GilDash: Writing is hard.
<legacyofvrak> thanks
<Saturn> 08,01anyone streaming?
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: But seriously though, it is not the "WOW" structure.
<MadSurge> MORE WOW
<cachi01> Saturn: yep wrek
<WallDives> Saturn: I think Wrek still is.
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Wrek is.
<Nyria|Fabulous> Saturn: Wreky is~
<legacyofvrak> or even...Dead Island?... Sniper Elite?... Anyone?
*Ninjazz|Work points at Wrek
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Wow is using the standard leveling gamestructure which came with games beforei t.
<GilDash> Om: Writing is easy. *Editing* is hard. I don't want to write because I keep focusing on having to edit it. :(
<Airpuff> GilDash: O.o
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: So? WoW is the king, it gets claim to the territory. :P
<Meanwhile> Saturn are you feeling ok?
<legacyofvrak> F.E.A.R. 1, OR 2... (I need 3 NOW)
<Acleps> GilDash: What is this "editing" you speak of?
<Om> GilDash: Okay, I suppose having a good editor is the hard part.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Editing and me are at constant odds with each other.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: i'm feeling a little hot; maybe i'll take off some clothes
<Airpuff> CK|Ded: Nah, wow isnt the king, just the fanboys talking about stuff they dont know, claiming wow was the fist and that all other games, even the ones released earlier are clones.
<CK|Ded> Airpuff: Sort of like how some shooters get compared to Halo, despite Halo reusing ideas from older games too.
*Meanwhile sighs.
<teh_Tharassan> has anyone tried Tribes Ascend?
<legacyofvrak> NEED IT... WANT IT [PsycoSparkle face]
<asneakykitty> don't compare games to other games
<Conyst> When you said that GilDash I thought of the fight music from StarTrek TOS
*alexxm hugs Meanwhile whats the matter
<cachi01> ^^
<cachi01> ^
<GilDash> Om: I can edit myself, but I don't have the confidence to pull it off.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm currently listening to Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2
<legacyofvrak> okay (meme)
<GilDash> Acleps: My mortal foe in the world of writing. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Give it a try :P
<Saturn> 08,01it's wonderful
<CK|Ded> asneakykitty: That's the only measurable way to decide if a game is worth purchasing. O.o
<Om> GilDash: I understand.
<Meanwhile> You've been kinda weird lately Saturn, as long as you're feeling alright though.
<Acleps> GilDash: No, but what is it in writing? Making the text better?
<GilDash> Conyst: Never watched much TOS, but I think I know the one you mean. ;)
<legacyofvrak> @Saturn: Im currently listening to WoodenToaster (Beyond Her Garden)
<Saturn> 08,01recording by Vadim Chaimovich
<WallDives> GilDash: all joking aside, I know what you mean. good luck with your story, and all.

<CrimsonPhoenix> Nabronyan: no one is streaming
*Meanwhile sips tea politely.
<WallDives> GilDash: considering I dont write (because I'm so dissatisfied with my writing in general), thats a hell of a achievement.
<Conyst> nothing is playing at the moment
<Acleps> GilDash: So, how many words would you write in one sessions?
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash: I know I just wanted to show it off since I was watching it just now

<GilDash> WallDives, Acleps: Usually betwen 1,000-2,000 words in one session. Last year I started *really* late, so I did 10,000 every day for five days. :$

<Ninjazz|Work> Because I am an idiot, Lil_B. :$
