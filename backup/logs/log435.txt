<Alister> 4 days is too soon
<NARF> genetic engineering
<flutter_spin> I've heard show them Lesson Zero or Bridle Gossip
<Meanwhile> Show him an episode, if it works he'll seek the rest out himself.
<Alister> flutter_spin: It's about itme is a good one too
<flutter_spin> But the music from Living Tombstone or Bronies react to Teens video works
<Meanwhile> What do you mean why? Your ship is dressed as a web creature!
<Malavolent> What are you guys talking about? How to convert non-belivers?
<flutter_spin> The only thing I would say is have him watch from the start and move on

<RX-78-SweetieBot> there is no "just a robot" in transformers
<Invi> why not?
<Meanwhile> Because a spark is like life force.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> if it has a personality, it has a spark
<cowvarkian> yeah, well I think that only cybertronians have spark, so there >_>
<Invi> ^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Transmutate is a cybertronian
<cowvarkian> bah, humbug
<RX-78-SweetieBot> he is a protoform that got damaged in the pod
<flutter_spin> oh Meanwhile... I posted my fanfic: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid if you want to read it
<Invi> maybe... transmutate... could be a mutant
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and failed to scan an alt mode
<cowvarkian> are we just arguing on pure conjecture, with no real fact or information?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> a mutant is failry acurate

<Digitalis> =_(\
<EpicPwnTime2> Yes, today is star wars day! but it made me wonder why isn't the A movie episode 5 and the b movie episode 1?
<Shizuka> 13because no one voted for them?
<Shizuka> 13because they're not that good?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Would episode 3 be considered an A movie?
<FillyFlam> Because the lotto is rigged, as we all know
<owlicious> Damn, 32/45
<EpicPwnTime2> I KNOW WHY!!
<TheDr> I am taking off you you all later! ;)

<Bronysith> CCCP: there are only 3 star wars if you ask me
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: um yea
<cowvarkian> ok
<FillyFlam> And then we'll sell action figures and posters and tons of other tie-in crap.
<Meanwhile> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3923/
<CCCP> Bronysith: i mean while the prequals imo are really bad they could have been worse
<derpy_pony> you now read everything in this chat in jar jar bings voice. forever
<cowvarkian> you know, this is why george lucas isnt making any more star wars movies, because the fucking "fans" are hating on the new ones...
<Unnr> Bronysith: try watching them in the following order: IV,V,II,III,VI
<Bronysith> CCCP: i hate the lightsaber battles so much
<Meanwhile> Who the schmuck is jar jar bings.
<Bronysith> Unnr: how about IV V VI
<CCCP> Bronysith: eh, i think they are okay
*Tovler has the untouched laserdisk rips Star Wars on the computer.
<Bronysith> CCCP: there is no emotion it is just choreographed bull shit
<cowvarkian> well, Ill come back when we arent discussing star wars
<CCCP> Bronysith: ya i guess but i can see why some people like it
<CCCP> cowvarkian: aww
<Bronysith> CCCP: yea stupid kids
<Cypresswolf> Oh, I'm saving this for shots, Single Barrel is worth the expense! I could sip on this for awhile
<Unnr> Bronysith: IV V VI works well, but if you want the full balance to the force arc it works better with episodes II and III worked in
<cowvarkian> because I actually like all the movies...
<Bronysith> Unnr: the prequels are non canon
<cowvarkian> and I like the ewoks
<That_British_Guy> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4ymd0w Oh god :D
<Meanwhile> Is it too late to bring back the religious debate?
<cowvarkian> and jar jar
<Tovler> Episode 2 did have that awesome Jango vs Obiwan fight.
<Invi> o dat jar jar
<Digitalis> Meanwhile, its best not to ^^
<CCCP> cowvarkian: well thats cool, i know alot of people that do
<Meanwhile> Digitalis: It'd be better than this.
<alexxm> who thinks mick foley should do a voice on the show
<Unnr> Bronysith: the prequels are A cannon and you know it. afterall, skippy is canon.
<Digitalis> but someone is bound to do it...
<EpicPwnTime2> how about i do a review of the entire star wars saga for you all!
<Tovler> :( but I love religion.
<Unnr> I <3 Skippy, the jedi droid
<cowvarkian> how about no EpicPwnTime2

<TheMaster> good choice
<cowvarkian> and am I supposed to know who mick foley is alexxm?
<Unnr> Bronysith: but the prequels being cannon are the reason that anikin skywalker-solo had such a bad death in the AU
<CCCP> bye OmegaMetroidBrony
<FlareChaser> Invi: Well like...thats just your opinion...man
<Meanwhile> Mick Foley, if I recall correctly, was a wrestler from the WWF.
<SilverSonic|Android> drf ill be tuning in toda
<Bronysith> Unnr: there is no reason for the prequels to have been made PERIOD
<SilverSonic|Android> +y

<Meanwhile> Yeah, Mankind, that was it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm a bit annoyed since I can't use my laptop due to missing the shipment of my hard drive
<TheMaster> mick foley is actually totally awesome
<Unnr> Bronysith: money is reason enough for many.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I can still use the station computer
<cowvarkian> other then, george lucas already planned on making prequels...

<WindWhistler> Hello fellow bronies!

<Meanwhile> Allo WindWhistler.

<Unnr> Bronysith: if I was going to spend a bunch of time watching anything starwars today, I would be re-watching the Star Wars Begins documentary
<FlareChaser> Invi: I'm too lazy D:
<TheMaster> well watership down is about bunnies murdering each other
<Invi> lol it's just taking a pic ^^
<CCCP> SSOOO many bronies B-days :D

<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: Why dont you give your tablet a whirl and draw your OC?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll copy and paste
<Sylandest> alexxm: im doing good even though my computrr died. Hard drive broke. Im using my Kindle Fire to join the streak. And hello, Invi!
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Ive been mesing with it Alot, it is REALLY going to take some getting use to, but i LOVE it :)
<Tovler> Kerrigan?
<drfsupercenter> 03OK seriously, what?
<drfsupercenter> 03I had one of those "push notifications" from Draw Something (and this is the PAID version, not the free one!) and it had what looked like news headlines... I clicked on it to see what it was about and then I get an email from Google saying my order of 75,000,000 Zynga chips for $99.99 couldn't be processed as my card was declined. (Thank god!)
<drfsupercenter> 03The real question... WTF JUST HAPPENED? Is Draw Something (which is now owned by Zynga) making it so if you accidentally click on their spammy news headlines, you get billed for $100?!?!?!?!
<Cypresswolf> Gentlemen's Jack is sweeter with a honeyed flavor, this is bolder, richer in smell & flavor, vanilla with a caramel finish
<Sylandest> *computer
<alexxm> you're streaking Sylandest?
<Invi> Sylandest your hard drive died? why?
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: Good...good....mmwahahahahaha
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow.

<DasPinkie> O hai Sumica
<CCCP> hi Sumica
<RX-78-SweetieBot> She is a voice in alot of mecha shows....
<flutter_spin> Uakh: Someone made a custom map of Starcraft 2 using the assets and redesigning the game as a resource defense game
<Sundaysmile> Wrek stop scaring your builders
<kirzstryfe> 1,3~work complete~
<Sundaysmile> Ion Cannon ready
<Sundaysmile> wait... wrong game
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And she voiced Dende in the canadian DBZ dub.....
<Uakh> little wonder these builders keep dying : look at the portrait, they're smoking cigarettes without filters D:
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Mind = Blown
*Invi shoots with confetti gun at kirzstryfe *toot*
<Sundaysmile> and they eat buttery biscuits
<Sumica> 00,10so what's the point?
<RankWinner> Hello people
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Must look up all the others now....
<Invi> hi RankWinner
<flutter_spin> heh. So I read the rules of EQD. Yeah, my story won't be able to work there...
<Sundaysmile> point of what Sumica?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Pinkie Pie is also Chi-Chi in DBZ and X23 in Xmen: Evolution....
<Invi> Sumica uh, having fun? I can't figure out more...
<Sumica> 00,10the game mode of SC2 wrek is playing
<RankWinner> Fun?
<Sundaysmile> Kill everything?
<Invi> fun
<Uakh> flutter_spin: too saucy ? :P
<flutter_spin> the game mode is to survive. It gives a few minutes to setup.
<flutter_spin> no, brony in Equestria...
<Uakh> what's the problem with that ?
<Blue_Leaf> Ello!
<flutter_spin> They no longer accept them I guess
<Invi> hi Blue_Leaf
<RankWinner> Aw yeah, my temp's gone down to 39C now... improvement over 40C a few hours ago
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Blue_Leaf> Hai Invi!
<CCCP> Wow there are sooo many channels on this site!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> AJ/RD is Black Widow in Ironman:AA, and Allura in Voltron Force....and one of the test sisters in johnny test....
<flutter_spin> They don't accept any human element
<HyperMetalLugia> No comment on the 24FPS vs 48FPS videos
<RankWinner> Hiho Blue_Leaf
<flutter_spin> crossovers are accepted, but no humans
<owlicious> what about anthropology?
<owlicious> oh, that'
<flutter_spin> they have changed the rules a couple times
<owlicious> s ponies in human world
<flutter_spin> I guess there is a new rule sometime after that fanfic was posted
<Shane377|SWAG> yo CCCP
<Uakh> you can still get it on fimfiction I'd assume
<Chrysalis> enjoying yourself there?
<flutter_spin> yeah. fimfiction accepts all sorts of stuff, even mature
<Uakh> EqD is overated anyway
<Chrysalis> didnt you have work to do
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Celestia is Farseer Macha in DoW.....
<Sundaysmile> Wall of turrets!
<flutter_spin> Shipping, romance.....
<Uakh> I dunno if DHN does fanfics
<RX-78-SweetieBot> its loading the pages right now
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so I have to wait before I can edit them
<Sundaysmile> I would agree Uakh, I only use them as a news source
<Digitalis> ewww
<EonMastor> fimfiction accepts almost anything
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (drfsupercenter10) 11WB10»11•. 10- oh, I wasn't planning on watching porn using your computer anyway :P
<Uakh> flutter_spin: porn on EqD is ok. As long as you provide saucy pics of trixie for seth's private use
<ezio> greetings
<Invi> hi ezio
<flutter_spin> heh. Well I go to EQD usually for news updates.
<Invi> ^
<ezio> what game is this
<flutter_spin> oh and pics. I like to see drawfriend stuff
<Uakh> might as well go to DHN
<Sundaysmile> Starcaft Craftcraft
<flutter_spin> fanfics and music I tend to bypass
<Invi> flutter_spin and comics :)
<Uakh> I subscribe both to EqD and DHN RSS
<Tovler> saucy art is ok, but overly stylized art isn't
<CCCP> Uakh: who is Seth anyway?
<flutter_spin> comics are soso. I sort of watch them on their own sites on deviantart and How Equestria Was Made
<Chrysalis> i swear, they knew boys were gonna watch and went "quick lets grab all the good boy cartoon female vas make em ponies and watch it grow"
<ezio> there are few fanfics i read, most of them are old cause all the new ones are overused
<Uakh> CCCP: a kid in arizona who has a spyro fetiche and dropped college to run EqD
<ezio> most of them are crossovers though
<Chrysalis> punctuation would of probably helped that
<Sundaysmile> uh oh
<CCCP> Uakh: ohh
<kirzstryfe> 1,3EqD has a lot more community updates, but I like DHN better, they fact check before posting news
<CCCP> okay
<Shane377|SWAG> wow Uakh
<Tovler> who hasn't dropped out of community college to play WoW/Run EQD?
*CCCP has never haerd of DHN
<Shizuka> 13also DHN posts our movie nights on time
<flutter_spin> I'm not too familiar with DHN. I guess I should check it out more.
<Shizuka> 13rather than midway through the B movie
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And Tara of course is at least one character in every cartoon, videogame, and anime dub ever.
<ezio> whats dhn
<Sumica> 00,10mostly
<flutter_spin> lol yeah. I notice that Shiz
<Shane377|SWAG> whats DHN is it a rival ponieh site?
<Uakh> Shane377|SWAG: don't be like you didn't know >.>
<kirzstryfe> 1,3www.derpyhooves.com
<flutter_spin> DerpyHoovesNews
<Uakh> DHN is like EqD but they fact check and act more profesionnaly
<Sundaysmile> I take it he cannot craft units?
<Shane377|SWAG> OMG derp haz news!!!!
<CCCP> thanks kirzstryfe
<Chrysalis> oh god, if tara wanted to take over a country there would be a literal army of fans to help her do it
<otakon17> Gonna take a shower, bbl
<Invi> thanks kirzstryfe
<Sumica> 00,10dat is some angry typeing
<flutter_spin> People aren't liking my fanfic on fimfiction.net
<owlicious> kirzstryfe: that has barely any derpy
<Tovler> DHN is still a better love story than Twilight
<Ouroboros> Hello.
<flutter_spin> I guess I can always hope some brony will read it on stream :P
<Uakh> flutter_spin: happens.
*Uakh shrugs
<kirzstryfe> 1,3DHN is run by a group of people, EqD is run by one person
<owlicious> Hoo [one person? Really?]
<TheSpitFire> flutterspin link me the fic i will read it
<flutter_spin> I've already been told that my chapters are too short....
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid
<Daring-doom> i thought it was 2 people
<Uakh> kirzstryfe: actually Cereal kinda co-runs it
<RX-78-SweetieBot> although it looks like Tabitha has been in more mecha shows than Tara....
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/mizH2.gif
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I want one
<Uakh> and Xyro is responsible for the all the streaming part
<owlicious> oh, first 4 are all sethisto
<Tovler> some guy named Calpain posting stuff on EqD
<Tovler> and Phoe
<StinkomanFan> Oh god Shizuka, her eyes are moving
<Invi> Shizuka dem eyes :'(
<Shizuka> 13wobble wobble
<kirzstryfe> 1,3difference between "run by" and "works for" :p
<CCCP> Shizuka: DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<flutter_spin> I guess if Sumica is happy with his appearance in the fanfic, that would be great...
<StinkomanFan> I thought there was a sub-plot going on with PK going insane too
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry have had a chance to read it yet, was sleeping
<flutter_spin> that's ok. I'm about to leave out of town for the weekend
<TheHoodyNinja> Hiya guys
<Tovler> uh-oh Phoe has gone insane and taken over EqD. Isn't RPing hilarious?
<flutter_spin> I prob won't be back until Monday
<CCCP> make love NOT war
<TheHoodyNinja> Yay drawfriend
<Shane377|SWAG> guys on dhn it said Love is in the air… it’s time to celebrate a royal wedding! My Little Pony – Friendship Is Magic: Royal Pony Wedding is coming to DVD on August 7, 2012 from Shout!
<StinkomanFan> Cereal is busy working at Equestrian Innovations
<Uakh> personally I like Cereal more than Seth
<Dark_Horst> what's with all the cables? addon i missed? or mod?
<Uakh> but that's just my opinion
<StinkomanFan> I like the Hoof board
<StinkomanFan> very useful
<Sumica> 00,10that was a deep disapointed sigh

<icybeauti> Nazis are bad, mkay?
<That_British_Guy> Pfft in this world what is being "Nice" anymore?
<FillyFlam> Well you could play as the Wehrmacht in WaW multiplayer.

<Shamroc> ....what the fuu is goin on here and why di o wanna play?
<PinkySpice> ;A;
<Freefall29> mw2 literally was just an upgraded version of mw1
<kenne> Otakon17: hey whatd you get from the comendation pack
<otakon17> kenne: Okay, I'll play a quick bronze as warmup
<XAX> That_British_Guy: Black Ops 2 is gonna be set in 2025. It'll be interesting to see how they manage that :l
<Chrysalis> Freefall29 world at war was an abysmal COD game
<pony_zen> Freefall, you make the model, and animation for it in Blender, then you could for one make sequence for it in hammer and with decompiled 2fort and make the whole thing using Source ingame engine, or other possibility is to use n00B methods, like Gmod with custom model you made and animated in blender. Have fun compiling.
<otakon17> kenne: Crusader shotty, its subpar
<Chrysalis> with no effort in game balance at all
<CCCP> Battlefeild: bad company > Battlefeild 3
<That_British_Guy> XAX Oh and Woods is alive!?!?!?! HOW!??!?
<CCCP> bad company 2*
<That_British_Guy> CCCP I agree 100%
<CCCP> hi XAX
<CCCP> That_British_Guy: :$
<pony_zen> Freefall29, and that was probably worst way to try to explain what I really meant
<eeveesprit> anyone remember medal of honor?
<Shamroc> question why is qrek playing Starcraft 2 dead chat?
<XAX> That_British_Guy: I havent even played Black ops 1 so I have no idea what so ever.
<That_British_Guy> OMG I LOVE MEDAL OF HONOR
<XAX> Hi CCCP :)
<Freefall29> pony_zen what if I use the models from the game, I have gcfscape, so I can extract the .mdl files all that
<That_British_Guy> Medal of Honor Airborne <3
<Freefall29> say, why would I decompile the models anyways
<XAX> I still got medal of honor allied assault on the PC somewhere
<sergio_scriptor> i remember medal of honor,it was one of my first shooter games :)
<StinkomanFan> A valid question
<Shamroc> also i cant tell if this is a very well made mod game or not..

<CCCP> hi StinkomanFan
<StinkomanFan> Hi CCCP
<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan: Oh dear
<ScootaChicken> What did I do?
<StinkomanFan> ...What does that stand for anyway?
<ScootaChicken> You don't want to know what I think it stands for.
<StinkomanFan> I hugged you and then LordCelestia got mad for no raison
<CCCP> StinkomanFan: CCCP = Russian lettering for USSR
<ScootaChicken> It's rather rude.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cutie Clop Crusaders Project

<ScootaChicken> So today I've been wondering whethr I should start doing the whole visual kei thing that was slightly popular in the 90s or something.
<ScootaChicken> *whether
<StinkomanFan> So, I got a theory
<Shamroc> and look its CCCP
<Shamroc> and RX-78-SweetieBot
<Shamroc> and Shamroc..
<StinkomanFan> Maybe Equestria is used to the whole "Coming under siege every other week" thing
<CCCP> hi Shamroc
<Shamroc> ello
<RX-78-SweetieBot> you feeling better today Shamroc?
<Shamroc> RX-78-SweetieBot: soooo much more
<RX-78-SweetieBot> good to hear
<CCCP> i think i might be a sadist
<StinkomanFan> Perhaps the entirety of Ponykind has been doing this whole "Saving Equestria" thing for as long as it's been around
<StinkomanFan> Everypony has had there own adventure and nopony really bats an eye anymore
<StinkomanFan> Just a theory
<StinkomanFan> Damnit, I killed the chat
<CCCP> ...
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll go get the defibs
<drfsupercenter> 03wb
*ScootaChicken zaps life back into the chat

<Pattyrick> 07Drake, it's unfortunate that you've never had a Krispy Kreme doughnut before
<Drake> 04...
*Pattyrick throws a regular glazed KK at Drake
<Drake> 04Yes I have
<CCCP> I hafts go, BMN starts at 7:00 right?
<Drake> 04They are delicious
<CCCP> good
<Pattyrick> 07Wait, do they have KK in Australia?
<Drake> 04They did, until they went out of business.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so kirzstryfe is guild wars 2 good
<Bronysith> hey CCCP i got a new chapter in
<Skylands> 10How does KK go out of business
<CCCP> Bronysith: great! can i read it later i have to go
<Shamroc> well TheGreatAndPowerfulT he talks about it alot so...yeah
<Skylands> 10Doughnuts are gooooood
<Bronysith> ok see ya CCCP
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yes, yes it is :p
<Drake> 04I know, I loved KK doughnuts.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's because Homer Simpson moved
<drfsupercenter> 03duh
<Shamroc> again kirzstryfe if only i had the money i would be playing with you right this moemto
<Drake> 04But I think they just opened too many stores.
<Pattyrick> 07That sucks D=
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want to play it, but i have doubts my laptop might not be powerful enough to play it
<Pattyrick> 07KK is one of the many reasons why I want to visit the States again
<Pattyrick> 07SHEENAh
<drfsupercenter> 03I keep misreading those as KKK and thinking you all are racist.
*Pattyrick throws a doughnut at drf
<SheenaFox> PATTAH.
<nickstr> maybe go to Portland
<nickstr> Oregon that is
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03Nickario
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr
<SheenaFox> do do do do do
<Angel_Umbreon> 13When I see KK I instantly think of the character from Animal Crossing .w.
<nickstr> they have a place called Voodoo Doughnuts
<drfsupercenter> 03you'll have to tell me if the stereo balance is better today
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll be using my laptop
*Angel_Umbreon also toasts Sheena
<nickstr> ok
*SheenaFox burnt
<drfsupercenter> 03and that just has a single soundboard controller
<drfsupercenter> 03not two
<Shamroc> mooo
<drfsupercenter> 03the computer I used last week I had to manually adjust the left and right
<drfsupercenter> 03and this week I'm also not going to overdrive it to hell >_>
<Pattyrick> 07More like Tacoma, because that be where my closest Krispy Kremetokeepdrffromhavinganervousbreakdown store is
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it actually takes less power than you'd think for a new game
<nickstr> even though I could not tell
<nickstr> AGC FTW!
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, supposedly nobody did
<drfsupercenter> 03but I could
<Shamroc> unless its crysis lol
<drfsupercenter> 03when I played back the 128kbps mp3s that they automatically save
<drfsupercenter> 03as air-logs
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the options are tweaked so it'll run fine on older systems
<drfsupercenter> 03it sounded AWFUKL
<drfsupercenter> 03-K
<drfsupercenter> 03the music was about 8dB too loud
<drfsupercenter> 03and I blame the guy who gave me the station orientation XD
<nickstr> yea because unlike the rest of us you can see the VU meters indicating pre-processing levels
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03He told me to have the VU meteres in the yellow
<drfsupercenter> 03then the station engineer was like "um, no. Never"
<StinkomanFan> Oh good video RQ's are up now
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm gonna have it in the GREEN today
<Shamroc> wait waht is goin on here
<nickstr> good idea
<biboo> Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
<biboo> Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
<biboo> Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
<nickstr> even then I can run additional processing
<nickstr> since they have a Winamp link
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<nickstr> I can use either Stereo Tool or Sound Solution
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna be using Winamp to play the songs
<nickstr> the second of the two I really like
<nickstr> you might want to keep those in mind
<nickstr> they are Winamp plugins for audio processing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll just wait until it can be pirated, try it and then if i can run it i'll buy it
<StinkomanFan> The Doctor wandered into a group of four naked heavies apperently
<Shamroc> ....whoa now
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :V
<nickstr> Stereo Tool is heavily featured but easy to screw up
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Quack
<Shamroc> ded
<StinkomanFan> Also The Do-DEAD
<nickstr> due to the fact you can set time constants for attack and decay
<drfsupercenter> 03eh, I'll just leave it as is
<nickstr> with dance music this will cause pumping artifacts
<drfsupercenter> 03but you'll have to tell me if the song More and More sounds good
<StinkomanFan> BROTHER I AM HIT
<StinkomanFan> Ohi Zues
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'm gonna do as you suggested
<drfsupercenter> 03and not normalize it
<nickstr> where the audio seems to drop in and out
<StinkomanFan> *Zeus
<drfsupercenter> 03so the intro is really really quiet
<drfsupercenter> 03and then it gets loud after about 30 seconds
<nickstr> ok
<drfsupercenter> 03so I won't know if it works out or not
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess it's a good test of the AGC
<StinkomanFan> This is very well silly
<nickstr> if it works as well as I think it will your listeners will not know
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Hats
<Shamroc> ...this is well made

<StinkomanFan> The Doctor clearly knows when shit's gotten to too stupid

<ScootaChicken> otakon: They're also both female.
<Yahooz> LadyCanary i think prefers to talk to the mods, most of which are not here
<StinkomanFan> Thank god for that
<ScootaChicken> I don't see you asking why emangamer isn't here.
<StinkomanFan> No colors in here
<StinkomanFan> NONE
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: hes gone for a while
<Meanwhile> emangamer apparently isn't coming back.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: well that is what made me think of them when StinkomanFan made that one comment is all.
<Meanwhile> Idk why, nor do I care.
<Chrysalis> LC isnt female
<IshBestPony> I ate otakon's liver with Fava beans and a nice Chiante
<ScootaChicken> WHAT?
<Chrysalis> he is our lord
<ScootaChicken> WHAAAAAT?
<Midnight_Fyre> Meanwhile: Why?
<ScootaChicken> EMANGAMER ISN'T COMING BACK?
<otakon> Chrysalis: LadyCanary, aka LC
<otakon> WHAT?!
<Chrysalis> ohhh
<ScootaChicken> WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Fyre: "idk why, nor do I care."
<Chrysalis> wow, really?
<otakon> the hell, that sucks!
<Yahooz> Well I dont know about forever Meanwhile, but he has had alot to do recently
<Chrysalis> never knew
<fluttercry> 05,15wait emangemer left?
<fluttercry> 05,15WHY?
*IshBestPony nomz otakon's liver with Fava beans and a nice Chiante
<Meanwhile> Personally I thought emangamer was a knobhead. So I'm fine with it.
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile why?
<fluttercry> 05,15but...it's one less regular
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile x knobheads
<Yahooz> fluttercry: Idk if its pernament but I know hes not coming back for a bit
<StinkomanFan> Queen Chrysalis, how was the trip to Canterlot?
<ScootaChicken> emangamer's gotten better lately tbh
<LordCelestia> 0,5He never officially up and left
<Chrysalis> StinkomanFan rather productive
<LordCelestia> 0,5he just rarely comes in
<EspyLacopa> Skin removal? Chicken skin can be delicious with some forms of cooking.
<CCCP> goodbye horses~
<Meanwhile> It's just the way he is.
<Chrysalis> lots of food from shining armour, didnt even need to fly home
<otakon> that still sucks LordCelestia
<Bronysith> CCCP: dont forget to tuck and dance
<Meanwhile> His personality, the way he speaks, everything about him just bugs me.
<Midnight_Fyre> How would one "officially leave"?
<CCCP> im not leaving Bronysith
<SunderlandPony89> Meanwhile: I think he's awesome
<otakon> Meanwhile: he's supposed to be "civilised"
<Meanwhile> otakon: I'm talking about emangamer
<null> Agrees SunderlandPony89.
<CCCP> Meanwhile: who annoys u?
<Bronysith> this is b4 movies based on books sucked
<null> agreed*
<otakon> Meanwhile: oh, he's a friend of mine.
<Meanwhile> Woop de doo.
<Yahooz> Well Meanwhile, hes on skype right now. If you wish I could quote you and share your thoughts about him.
<Meanwhile> As if your choice in friends somehow affects my opinion that he's a knobhead.
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, otakon and I are like the Marx Brothers of the Regular Room
<ScootaChicken> I personally think that emangamer's gotten better as of late.
<otakon> we are?
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: If you somehow get your jollies in that manner, by all means.
<otakon> Am I Groucho?
<StinkomanFan> ptptptptpptptp
<Bronysith> i puked
*IshBestPony nomz otakon's liver with Fava beans and a nice Chiante

<Shamroc> nom
<Bronysith> fava beans are nasty
<IshBestPony> ptptptptptptptpt
<Yahooz> emangamer, i will say, was a bit of a suck up for a bit, but hes still a good guy
<otakon> IshBestPony: I only have one, and you apparently ate it already
<CCCP> wtf is a fava bean?
<otakon> oh God
<StinkomanFan> I'm assuming Tom is Harpo
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: a bit?

<StinkomanFan> AGENT STARLING
<otakon> O_______o
<EspyLacopa> Bah. There have always been horrible movies that were based on books.
<ScootaChicken> Hannibal Lecter is a very likeable villian.
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<DashWithRainbows> This.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: he is
<DashWithRainbows> So much this.
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: like discord
<StinkomanFan> Then why does he scare me?
<otakon> hiya DashWithRainbows what's up man?
<ScootaChicken> You sort of want him to win, even though he's the villain.
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan you're scared of Pinkie Pie.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: charismatic villains
<CCCP> ScootaChicken: how is anyway is he a villain?
<SunderlandPony89> ScootaChicken: Good way of putting it. He actually seems like a good guy
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile PINKIE PIE CAN HUNT YOU THROUGH REALITY
<Midnight_Fyre> That was, um, disturbing
<SunderlandPony89> CCCP: He's ate people
<DashWithRainbows> otakon not much, just thinking about stuff. How about yourself?
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: sounds legit.
<EspyLacopa> Aside from his unsatiable love of eating people.
<CCCP> SunderlandPony89: its not a bad idea
<StinkomanFan> PINKIE PIE CAN BREAK INTO PEOPLES HOUSES AND LEAVES THINGS LAYING AROUND
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: okay, but dammit still no job
<ScootaChicken> There's a scene later in the film when he does a thing which we should see as abhorrent, but you can't help but want to cheer him on.
<ScootaChicken> Not a spoiler.
<Chrysalis> EspyLacopa people are tsty
<EspyLacopa> Kinda why his cell has no bars, just heavy duty glass.
<DashWithRainbows> Boy do I know that feel otakon.
<Chrysalis> apparently human tastes like pork
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: oh no. She might leave you a cake.
<Chrysalis> i like to think human tastes of bacon
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: u sick fuck
<Tovler> When did he eat them? People were quite tasty before Hight Fructose Corn Syrup among other things.
<IshBestPony> Chrysalis way to much fat though
<Shamroc> ded
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia tastes of bacon
<StinkomanFan> PINKIE PIE CAN TAKE YOU OUT OF EXISTANCE IF SHE WANTED TO
<CCCP> Chrysalis: no it tastes moar like ham

<StinkomanFan> I can feel it coming
<Tovler> She's a wee lassie
<ScootaChicken> wow
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: Ms. Moffit
<ScootaChicken> I love Jodie Foster
<Meanwhile> SunderlandPony89: It's a storage place for someone named Moffit, Dr.Lecter clued her in on it.
<SunderlandPony89> Thanks
<EspyLacopa> So if she's Lois Lane, who's her Superman?
<CCCP> dat owl
<Bronysith> inb4 that wasnt in the book
<otakon> EspyLacopa: Hannibal Lector
<Bronysith> ive never read the book though so idc
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, I don't know what it is about Pinkie Pie but she's just... unsettling
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: I was gonna say that
<otakon> no really, THAT'S her SUperman
<CCCP> ewww US flah
<CCCP> flag*
<SunderlandPony89> Burn it!
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: perhaps it's because you're a giant wuss.
<StinkomanFan> Eeeeew Bri'is' people
<otakon> GODDAMMIT I MUST SEE THE AVENGERS!
<Midnight_Fyre> She isn't bound by social norms or physics. Such a being is unsettling
<otakon> Chrysalis: you lucky bastard
<Meanwhile> otakon: so go to a cinema.
<StinkomanFan> TELEPOR MARE-IO
*SunderlandPony89 is slightly unsettling then
<Yahooz> i dont get why everyone wants to see Avengers tbh :p
<otakon> Meanwhile: no care, and I live 20 miles from the nearest theater
<Meanwhile> ^
<Tovler> just yell AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE!
<otakon> AVENGERS!
<SunderlandPony89> Yahooz: I've heard it's bloody amazing
<otakon> ASSEMBLE!
<SilverSonic> Hi Aero :3
<Meanwhile> otakon: so get a bus.
<Midnight_Fyre> I'll wait till it's on DVD. I don't get into superhero movies
<EspyLacopa> Feh. I continue my crusade of seeing Grave of the Fireflies for the A movie.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no buses in the country
<otakon> EspyLacopa: WHY?
<Wolverine> Hey
<Wolverine> you called?
<SunderlandPony89> DOWNFALL FOAR A MOVIE
<Aeroslash> hi
<Yahooz> dayum

<CCCP> ow
<Midnight_Fyre> yummy
<Bronysith> shit yo
<SunderlandPony89> That's where I left that head...
<Tovler> MY GOD… Marvel's Avengers was awesome
<Meanwhile> The last superhero flick I saw was Captain America, and around half way through I needed the bathroom, which was out of order. Que awkward chair shuffling for an hour.
<otakon> Meanwhile: lol
<StinkomanFan> OH SHI-
<Shamroc> dat drawer
<otakon> Tovler: I so want to see it
<otakon> SO VERY MUCH
<StinkomanFan> It's a note
<otakon> well, that's not creepy :P
<Tovler> Thor sucked, Iron Man 2 sucked, Captain America was better than expected.
<CCCP> its a trap!
<Meanwhile> When it was over I found the nearest public restroom and went for at least a full minute and a half.
<StinkomanFan> I loved Cap'n America
<otakon> Tovler: I heard CA was pretty good actually
<StinkomanFan> Ohey TV
<Chrysalis> otakon you should see the avengers, its REALLY good
<StinkomanFan> Change the channel to ponies and he'll open like a book
<nickstr> WKUF 94.3 and WAVN 1450 AM stereo
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: try drinking 5 liters worth of large Coke and suddenly have to go during the movie XD
<Midnight_Fyre> Only superhero movie I've loked forward too for a while is Dark Knight Rises, and even that I just expect to enjoy somewhat
<Bronysith> eeeeyup StinkomanFan
<Tovler> But Avengers… I always thought "smiling through the whole movie" was some hyperbole.
<nickstr> the second of the two is my low power AM station
<otakon> Chrysalis: I want to, but dammit I have no transport and no one willing to give me a lift. I get no special transport since I don't work atm
<nickstr> with audio fidelity so good ITS ILLEGAL
<nickstr> I am not joking
<otakon> Tovler: I've done something like that with WALL-E and Toy STory 3
<CCCP> fucking?
<StinkomanFan> NOW I remember why Pinkie creeps me out, she's always...hhhhhhaaaaappppy
<nickstr> if I were licensed for AM broadcast the FCC would cite me for bandwidth violations
<Yahooz> how direct
<nickstr> 15 KHz audio instead of 10.6
<SunderlandPony89> Hannibal is best character
<StinkomanFan> Ness...nessnessnessnessness
<Midnight_Fyre> Tovler: Describes my experience with Inglourious Basterds
<StinkomanFan> Drawrings
<Tovler> This and Toy Story 3 were the only times I had real emotions during a movie.
<otakon> Tovler: what? not for Wall E?
<Ray> 02Well, I'm out
<StinkomanFan> Tovler, I'm the oppisite. I CRY LIKE A BITCH
<Ray> 02Nini everyone~ :3

<otakon> oh dammit the tears THE TEARS!
<Ray> 02Bye Aero :3
<Aeroslash> cya
<Tovler> I never saw Wall-E in theatres.
<otakon> Tovler: have you seen it though?
<Aeroslash> :)
<Tovler> but TS3. :'( I cried.
<Meanwhile> I was mildly upset during Toy Story 3.
<Chrysalis> Wall-E that film caused way too much emotion inh me for what it was
<StinkomanFan> I was damned with being born with a Moral Compass
<otakon> StinkomanFan: same here
<Midnight_Fyre> I saw Wall-E at a drivein. Yes, those still exist
<CCCP> when ever any one has the name hannibal i cant help but think of this guy
<Bronysith> I LOVE TOM PETTY
<otakon> ah, suddenly to Memphis
<StinkomanFan> Cursed with the inability to Empathise
<CCCP> I love this scene
<Tovler> I think I almost felt something in Wall-E.
<otakon> StinkomanFan: I over empathisize
<Tovler> Felt nothing in Up.
<Chrysalis> Midnight_Fyre pics or it didnt happen
<IshBestPony> It puts teh lotion on its skin or it gets teh hose again
<ScootaChicken> I liek this song.
<otakon> Tovler: the first 10 minutes go me
<CCCP> IshBestPony: :3
<StinkomanFan> Wait, no Empathise means To feel Empathy right?
<otakon> I wonder how much those goggles cost back then
<Midnight_Fyre> Sorry, I don't document my movie experiences with photos
<SunderlandPony89> KITTY
<StinkomanFan> MEW
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: it wasn't all photos!
<Chrysalis> but its a drive in
<Meanwhile> More than that guy should be able to afford.
<IshBestPony> dat pussy
<CCCP> its Rarity's CAT!
<otakon> StinkomanFan: yes, it means to feel empathy
<SunderlandPony89> Ok, now if they kill that chick i'll be PISSED
<Chrysalis> those things are basically like a black+white tv
<Midnight_Fyre> Probably a few thousand dollars
<null> Ok... I missed like 2 minutes. With my luck that xact part was the most important in the entire movie.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: just watched
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers: The Cat is Buffalo Bill
<SunderlandPony89> JUST KEEP GOING
<CCCP> null: nope
<Bronysith> TIS A TRAP
<SunderlandPony89> THINK OF YOUR CAT
<otakon> and he prays on empathy
<CCCP> StinkomanFan: i knew it!
<Meanwhile> T'is a very clever trap.
<IshBestPony> ITS A TRAP
<StinkomanFan> APATHY, That's the word I was looking for!
<SunderlandPony89> POOR KITTY :'(
<Bronysith> Shows you that kindness is punished in this world
<CCCP> ITS NOT a trap?
<StinkomanFan> I cannot produce apathy
<SunderlandPony89> No more owner!
<CCCP> no wait its a trap
<otakon> StinkomanFan: that means you can't feel what other people do
<otakon> and here it comes
<null> So what was that note she got?
<Tovler> Avengers… I thought after TDK I'd never see a fun yet good superhero movie again.
<StinkomanFan> No, apathy is a lack of comcern for someone
<otakon> null: it wasn't a note, it was a towel
<StinkomanFan> *concern
<CCCP> i told you to stay back in the kitchen!
<IshBestPony> Noooooooo, he left a cat without its owner
<null> Oh :P
*SunderlandPony89 is now pissed

<Bronysith> buffalo bill is a sick fuck
<StinkomanFan> also >rape
<CCCP> Bronysith: no hes not!
<Meanwhile> He kinda is.
<Midnight_Fyre> The thing I hate about movies like this is that they remind me that there really are sick fucks like this out there who kidnap people to do all sorts of sick shit to them

<StinkomanFan> I can has movie role?
<CCCP> NO people do this all the time

<SunderlandPony89> StinkomanFan: You can has no owner because of that sick bastard
<IshBestPony> CCCP then all the time people are sick fucks
<Meanwhile> True fact, never underestimate the human ability to be truly monstrous.
<CCCP> IshBestPony: yes
<otakon> Meanwhile: eeyup
<StinkomanFan> Buffalo Bill is based on a real guy BTW
<CCCP> ^
<IshBestPony> CCCP puts the lotion on CCCP
<Meanwhile> Doesn't that just chill your blood.
<Midnight_Fyre> I could believe that
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: seems legit. im seriously convinced
<IshBestPony> CCCP puts the lotion on CCCPs Skin or CCCP gets the hose
<Bronysith> meanwhile like a cherry icey
<StinkomanFan> The famous Wisconsin killer
<Tovler> When I go to Youtube, I always wonder how people can write the comments they write.
<SilverSonic> WOO one of my favorite MJ songs
<StinkomanFan> Ed Gein, naturally
<Midnight_Fyre> ?me heads over to Wikipedia
<Bronysith> Tovler: they be trolling
<CCCP> Also the serial killer in psycho is also based off of the real guy
<SunderlandPony89> Tovler: Because stupidity

<IshBestPony> Shamrocs potatoes,
<DSNesmith> what's up with their noses?
<StinkomanFan> You commit four homocides you are a serial killer

<ScootaChicken> So all soldiers are serial killers then?
<ScootaChicken> Well, basically all soldiers
<IshBestPony> otakon unless its in ring or french fried form
<Meanwhile> Anything above that is just a serial killer who's progressively better at their chosen path in life.

<Everlasting_Joy> otakon, we just got through a thunderstorm/tornado warning.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: it IS true, also how is that young female friend of yours?
<CupcakeWarrior> Does this movie even have lambs in it?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Midnight_Fyre!
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: We had a nasty thunderstorm last night, you okay?
<Everlasting_Joy> SunderlandPony89 I could have told you that.
*ErshBerstPerner nerms ern lermb mert
<SunderlandPony89> Everlasting_Joy: That storm hit me a few hours ago. There was a tornado 30 miles away
<StinkomanFan> I get it, Chrysalis loves her subjects VERY MUCH ;)
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: no it does not, but THIS is the bit about the lambs
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken Tis a lie. I'm totally legal.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: She's fine, I'm going for her attractive friend at the moment.
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Prove it.

<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon, yep, our town and house are just fine. It seems the twister was small and only lasted a couple of minutes/miles and it seems to not have destroyed it.
<Meanwhile> I used to own a couple of lambs.
<Meanwhile> Little bastards ate my bedsheet.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: I've known her for like my whole life, it would be weird and would probably wreck our friendship.

<StinkomanFan> Again, an Ophanage that is run by a church that is also an insane asylum is the scariest possible place

<Everlasting_Joy> SunderlandPony89: I bet, the twister was in my county, a little too close for comfort.
<SilverSonic> LOL that combo
<otakon> ScootaChicken: but a relationship with a friend is basically the next step. It sounds like you two you'd get along.
<SunderlandPony89> Everlasting_Joy: It was one county away for me, and thank God it didn't hit my county. I would of shat myself :P
<SilverSonic> Too Unlimited - No Limit XD
<ScootaChicken> otakon: And she's not that interested in relationships at the moment.

<null> shippers x otakon
*Tovler wonders how much a human skin purse goes for on the black market.
<NightSeas> 02not everyone can like the same things
<Aurora> 6I actually get irritated when my name shows up on that script
<NightSeas> 02:P
<CCCP> otakon X buffalo bills victoms
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I want to be a mod
<ScootaChicken> purely because he'll probably end up banning like half the chat
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Aurora> 6it's not as bad as the force ownership script that whoever had
<SunderlandPony89> WHERE'S HANNIBAL?!
<IshBestPony> otakon x berferler berl
<Nick> off to bed night
<otakon> Tovler: only a couple hundred I'm sure, human skin is VERY available
<Meanwhile> SunderlandPony89: Who knows.
<Aurora> 6night
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, the only good thing about human killers are that they can be killed
<NightSeas> 02that was Ascendant
<Tovler> lol, Bieber Pelt.

<Everlasting_Joy> Anyone else want cake?
<NightSeas> 02I would say NS but I don't want to hear any jokes :P
<CCCP> I only like Red cakes
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith I'll take the opposite of what you said.
<StinkomanFan> Why do you think I was clinging to her Bronysith?
<IshBestPony> er mers Lyra
<Tovler> mmm. Red velvet pancakes
<NightSeas> 02she gave it to someone though
<Meanwhile> Guess who.
<StinkomanFan> I mers Lyra too
<Aurora> 6I know I tend to get upset at irrational things
<CCCP> :O
<Aurora> 6shipping and ownership scripts are two of them
<SaxyPretender> 0,14say wha
<Aurora> 6mainly because I don't like my name being brought up
<CCCP> ...and then the sequals SUCKED
<Kyubree> 07also cuz eons are the only things worth owning
*Kyubree runs
<NightSeas> 02but you like using the !Espeon script
*Espeon now belongs to NightSeas for 10 minutes
<ScootaChicken> What a magnificent bastard.
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't say they sucked.
<IshBestPony> Red Dragon foar A movie
<DSNesmith> wow
<DSNesmith> way to ruin her day
<Kyubree> 07cuz he was first lol
<Meanwhile> They definitely weren't as good, but sequels rarely are.
<CCCP> Red Dragon was a prequal
<StinkomanFan> HIM
<SunderlandPony89> ScootaChicken: He's the definition of a magnificant bastard
<CCCP> not a sequal
<Aurora> 6the espeon script has been around probably 3 times as long as you have
<Midnight_Fyre> Was Manhunter the first Hannibal movie made?
<Tovler> he didn't hang up the phone right?
<IshBestPony> Red Dragon foar A movie
<ScootaChicken> I get the feeling that Clarice actually sort of likes Hannibal.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: or in case of star wars PREQUELS lol
<Aurora> 6and he WILLINGLY has it here
<DSNesmith> pretty sure this was the first Hannibal Lector movie
<ScootaChicken> in a weird way.
<DSNesmith> released, anyway
<Aurora> 6there was a time where kyu "owned" me and i asked him to stop cuz it was annoying
<NightSeas> 02I don't have a real ownership script :D
<Midnight_Fyre> I thought Manhunter was 80s
<StinkomanFan> And it ends
<Tovler> delicious dominicans
<null> Well
<DSNesmith> shit, that was genuinely scary
<StinkomanFan> 9/10, would watch again
<DSNesmith> I'm pleased
<Midnight_Fyre> Yep, Manhunter was 1986
<ScootaChicken> 10/10
<CCCP> well this was the best Hannibal movie
<ScootaChicken> Masterpiece.
<CCCP> 10/10
<Midnight_Fyre> True

<IshBestPony> Bronysith puts the lotion on Bronysith's skin or else Bronysith gets the hose again
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: what is this "Palm" you speak of
<DSNesmith> strong words.
*Bronysith force shocks IshBestPony
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's a palm tree :3

<CCCP> Meanwhile: now thats not nice at all, no one deserves that :s
<Meanwhile> That is how the world should work.
*IshBestPony dodges

<DSNesmith> wow, Meanwhile. So you should be punished for every bad thing you've ever done? That's a bit silly.
<Meanwhile> The world should not sit idly and allow it's naughty children to get away without so much as a tap on the wrist.
<Bronysith> TROLLESTIA

<Yahooz> suddenly Celestia
<StinkomanFan> ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY WINGBONER

<IshBestPony> what are you InSayan?
<Meanwhile> The fact that I want her thrown in a blender is mainly because I hate her at the very core, but even so she doesn't deserve anyone's affection.
<Yahooz> IshBestPony: yehes. PBBBBBBT

<SunderlandPony89> otakon: I mean the Eiken chick btw. Probably should of made that clear
<Everlasting_Joy> If I recall right, most of the bad acting is due to bad directing.
<SunderlandPony89> Bad acting is from bad acting
<DSNesmith> Hi there grandpa hobo
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy: the director didn't speak englidh
<CCCP> english*
<otakon> Chiharu gets a bust of 132cm by the end of the series, and Komoe has a 122cm bust at 13 weighing 101lbs.
<DSNesmith> and I'm a ghost!
<Midnight_Fyre> I think the Director was foreign and didn't know the first thing about what English is supposed to sound like
<StinkomanFan> Way back when they could afford to back u[

<PCCC> i feel like this show takes place in a weird alternate universe during the industrial revolution
<DSNesmith> dem blue eyes
<Everlasting_Joy> Hi Derpy!
<DSNesmith> yeah the tech level is great
<DSNesmith> that's some mighty persistent mud
<SunderlandPony89> PCCC: I'm confused on the level of technology in Equestria. No modern weapons, but they have a modern hospital. SO CONFUSING
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: I don't have a sneaky face D:
<Midnight_Fyre> PCCC: the tents and flags and stuff all over the place always make me feel like it's a cross between modern day and the Renaissance
<DSNesmith> I'm loving this music
<PCCC> SunderlandPony89: IKR
<DSNesmith> aw
<DSNesmith> I always hope they'll win
<PCCC> Midnight_Fyre: it could be, but many of the machines they have seem turn of the century
<DSNesmith> dat horn
<PCCC> :o
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I said SB.........wait that pings you
<DSNesmith> WAHAHA
<otakon> FABULOSITY!
<PCCC> SWAG
<DSNesmith> man, she can hold her breath a long time
<otakon> and then THE SPA!
<SunderlandPony89> PCCC: Then again, the ancient equipment the Canterlot Royal Guard used could of been just for show
<PCCC> they cheated
<Midnight_Fyre> PCCC: a lot do, but then a lot also seem really modern. It's like a weird amalgamation of time periods
<DSNesmith> they've got magic, why would they bother with gunpowder
<DSNesmith> most modern thing is manehatten
<PCCC> SunderlandPony89: ya it could have been
<Midnight_Fyre> Who knows, but we know they have bullets and cannons
<DSNesmith> I like how spike's just randomly in Rarity's house
<PCCC> Midnight_Fyre: i guess
<DSNesmith> inb4 wet mane spam
<Everlasting_Joy> DSNesmith: He's there to scope her house out so he knows where to sneak in.
<PCCC> But New York was around in the industrial revolution
<SunderlandPony89> I gotta send an email to DHX and ask them to show the level of technology Equestria gas
<toBeiteewS-87-XR> We realy need to see the tech level of a large city better to have an idea of the overall tech level.
<SunderlandPony89> Show, tell, whatever :P
<DSNesmith> considering canterlot is the captiol
<toBeiteewS-87-XR> A small town isnt going to have all the latest tech
<DSNesmith> I'd say it's an average tech level
<PCCC> awwwwww this made me cry :')
<toBeiteewS-87-XR> and canterlot is heavily magic
<Midnight_Fyre> True, I'd like to see more of Manehattan
<DSNesmith> with some fancy medieval style buildings, of course
<PCCC> thanks DSNesmith *hugs*
<DSNesmith> y'welcome
<DSNesmith> it's one of my favs
<DSNesmith> now we just need to get Owl's Well shown in here
<DSNesmith> instead of Party of One for the zillionth time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like during the summer
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Tovler> The Avengers was so good, it made me hate the Nolan batman movies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14o_o
<Midnight_Fyre> Yes, the technology seems like it's from all over the 20th century and the architecture seems Medieval/Renaissance
<DSNesmith> -.o
<PCCC> I would like the final to be streamed again
<DSNesmith> right well I'm off for the night, cya folks
<SunderlandPony89> Well then it's time for me to head out. Night guys!

<TheRainbowDash> MakerDusk: Just like "Hey, I locked myself out of the car, get my keys please! They're outside of the door, and I can't reach it!":D
<Everlasting_Joy> I suppose it's like locking yourself out of your car.

<Everlasting_Joy> Shamroc it's a running gag amongst MahBoi777 and I, and that stems from this. . .
<MahBoi777> YES

<MahBoi777> tis tradition
<Everlasting_Joy> Shamroc: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny1G0DNx1_M

<Bronysith> Wat anime is this
<LordCelestia> 0,5So here's a question.
<Shamroc> i await
<MahBoi777> ?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why do you (or some of you) feel this place should be "secret"?
<MahBoi777> tell the world
<TheRainbowDash> Well...
<TheRainbowDash> Fuck, umm...I do not think it should be.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't but it would get too spammy to read if it was just another room i guess
<Bronysith> night Jaketehsnake
<Shamroc> ...well LordCelestia. didnt you make the channel so a small group of regulars could chat in..a relaxed inviroment
<Shamroc> enviroment*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Yes, but I never made it to be some secret hideout.
<Everlasting_Joy> It's still nice though.
<TheRainbowDash> LordCelestia: Like of such for getting in by PM invitations and all that?
<LordCelestia> 0,5People can get in here however they like.
<Twi_Fi> By breaking in.
<TheRainbowDash> Alright then....
<LordCelestia> 0,5People take this palce as some kind of secret treehouse
<LordCelestia> 0,5or something
*Twi_Fi likes trees.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Sure, we dont go telling people
<LordCelestia> 0,5but if someone makes it in we arent gonna freak out
<Shamroc> yeah...well otakon freaked out when i first got in lol
<Everlasting_Joy> I beg to differ, and not me specifically.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Pff
<LordCelestia> 0,5Otakon freaks out over everything
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc same lol
<MahBoi777> soooo we shud tell moar people right?

<LordCelestia> 0,5pffff
<LordCelestia> 0,5Well, no
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dont tell more people
<Shamroc> LordCelestia.. and the 4 or 5 shippings
<Everlasting_Joy> I remember one night, some folks got in, and a couple folks told them to get out and what not.
<MahBoi777> how rude
<Twi_Fi> How sad...
<LordCelestia> 0,5You know what
<LordCelestia> 0,5Do whatever you like
<LordCelestia> 0,5Just dont go advertising this channel, because it's against our rules of coursew
<MahBoi777> okay
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey, I have yet to advertize this, as a matter of fact, I have no plans on.
<Everlasting_Joy> this channel, I should specify this channel.
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, never thought of advertising LordCelestia untio you told me not to.:P
<TheRainbowDash> (until)
<MahBoi777> I only get on dis channel on fridays
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<LordCelestia> 0,5Original purpose of channel: Place with slower chat than mane
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not a secret bunker
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ok?
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, only 27 ponies here.
<MahBoi777> yessir
<TheRainbowDash> Compared to of 146 in mane chat.
<Everlasting_Joy> There were 44 here during the show TheRainbowDash.
<TheRainbowDash> As of right now Everlasting_Joy, and even then, 44 is not a lot.
<TheRainbowDash> As to of nearly 300 in mane chat at that time.
<Everlasting_Joy> Right, I'm just stating the population has been cut in half since then.
<Twi_Fi> I missed movie night....
<MahBoi777> me too TT_TT
<Shamroc> didnt miss much
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Awww...
<MahBoi777> Silence of the Lambs be freaky

<TheRainbowDash> I was literally almost banned on the first day here.
<Shamroc> i found out about the room when otakon said somthing bout it in mane chat...i pestered him and kirzstyfe ended up giving me the room info..
<LordCelestia> 0,5By the time I actually sat through every episode, S2 was only a few weeks away
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i became a brony around ep 12 i think

<Bjornfot> So, I wasn't here yesterday... is dis any gud?
<Randomnerd> Hey all.
<Bronysith> hiya Randomnerd m
<Twi_Fi> Hey Randomnerd.
<Meanwhile> Allo Randomnerd.
<Meanwhile> Bjornfot: Have you never seen Silence of the Lambs?
<DashWithRainbows> Silence of the lambs?
<Twi_Fi> Silence of the Lambs!
<Bjornfot> Meanwhile: probably not?
<Meanwhile> Well then you suck.
<Meanwhile> It's awesome.
<Randomnerd> :)
<Shamroc> lol
<Randomnerd> Let's get out of creepytown
<Bjornfot> k
<SteveCharb> hello clarissssse
<Randomnerd> You look good enough to eat.
<Randomnerd> Baltimore is a terrible place to live.
<Twi_Fi> It is?
<Randomnerd> It has very bad crime rates.
<Twi_Fi> oh
<Randomnerd> People there are actually very friendly, but so many parts of the city are dangerous.
<Randomnerd> Towson, just to the North, is a college town.
<Randomnerd> Oh, dat Hannibal.
<SteveCharb> Randomnerd: yeah that matches my experience too
<Bronysith> why Meanwhile why http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/191/
<Meanwhile> Shaddup
<Bronysith> lol
<Randomnerd> What Migs was referring to was probably Fells Point -a gentrified area, or The Inner Harbor, which may not have been well-developed at the time of this production.
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile, I am disappoint.
<Randomnerd> Inner Harbor of "Ballimer" = Times Square of NYC.
<Randomnerd> Not Migs, the idiot administrator, I mean.
<Shamroc> ....i just did somthing im possibly going to regret for the rest of my life..
<Twi_Fi> ?
<Randomnerd> ?
<Randomnerd> What's up?
<Shamroc> ...well i think i just embraced a religion without attempting too..
<Twi_Fi> Huh
<Bronysith> molestia http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: as you do.
<Bjornfot> molestia is best lestia
<Shamroc> Meanwhile...hmm? i dont understand
<Twi_Fi> I don't understand anything here.
<Randomnerd> Shamroc: If you're worried, you can Talk to your clergyman
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: it's just a sort of acknowledgement of what you said.
<Shamroc> Randomnerd...thats the thing...this is literaly the first...of any kind of religion i've talked about in a serious manner
<Randomnerd> I'm an Athiest, I might be the best person to talk to about this?
<Randomnerd> Might not, rather lol
<Bjornfot> What religion?
<SteveCharb> jesus christ how horrifying
<Shamroc> Bjornfot..not completly sure...thats why im freaking..
<Meanwhile> As if it matters, all religions are basically the same with the only difference being in the fine print.
<null> That's true.
<Bjornfot> the idea of religion. anyway
<Bjornfot> at least western religions
<Bjornfot> eastern religions are quite different, take Buddhism for example
<Shamroc> Randomnerd...I'm not an Athiest...i just had no major religion..
<Randomnerd> I love how Lecter has all the answers.
<Meanwhile> Well, he IS brilliant.
<Randomnerd> The only other thing I've seen this guy in is "Moby Dick" as Starbuck.
<Randomnerd> Dear Princess Celestia: Today I learned not to help anyone!
<Bronysith> Randomnerd: your faithful student twilight sparkle
<Randomnerd> Ew.
<Randomnerd> Gah :(
<CCCP> did i miss buffalo bills dance?
<Randomnerd> CCCP: Oh, no. Not yet.
<Meanwhile> That isn't for like, an hour.
<CCCP> ok

<Randomnerd> Bronystate for ladies.
<SteveCharb> Randomnerd: do you think she'll like the way I killed Reagan for her?

<CCCP> i like this one moar
<LunaTheBeloved> And the dad talks to him afterwards
<CCCP> but that was hilarious
<Meanwhile> LunaTheBeloved: I only recall that vaguely. The line "OH MY GOOOOOOOD" sorta eclipsed it in my brain.

<Bronysith> oh hey LunaTheBeloved i got a new chapter done and finishing up another one lol
<SteveColt> ScootaChicken: THIS WASN'T THE 80s?
<SteveColt> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1464/
<CCCP> when was it made early 90s?
<ScootaChicken> SteveColt: 1990 I believe
<ScootaChicken> So people were probably still recovering from the shock of the 80s
<SteveColt> ew get outta my decade you lousy movie
<Meanwhile> This was made in a cave with a box of scraps.
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello TGAPT
<Meanwhile> And not by Tony Stark.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi, good afternon everyone
<CCCP> This IS a funny movie no one can deny that
<LunaTheBeloved> Also, saw the Avengers last night
<ScootaChicken> And Nirvana hadn't released Nevermind at this point, so the 90s was still kind of... 80s
<LunaTheBeloved> Insane
<ScootaChicken> LunaTheBeloved: I SAW THAT TODAY
<ScootaChicken> WITH A BUNCH OF BRONIES
<SteveColt> ScootaChicken: ooh nice marker
<ScootaChicken> WAS AMAZING
<LunaTheBeloved> It was great
<SteveColt> 90's: Nevermind to 9/11
<LunaTheBeloved> My friends and I wore SuperHero masks
<ScootaChicken> SteveColt: Seems about right
<Meanwhile> I probably won't see The Avengers.
<SteveColt> Meanwhile: lol why not?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: according to midnight it was really good
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh heroes that WERENT in the movie
<Meanwhile> Because I'm not really interested.
<SteveColt> well ok but what if it's reeeeally good?
<LunaTheBeloved> I went as Batman
<Bronysith> LunaTheBeloved: have u read my fanfic yet
<Meanwhile> I won't make any effort to see it, but it might drift into view at some time.
<Meanwhile> LunaTheBeloved: Pfft, that isn't even Marvel. *nerdspex*
<LunaTheBeloved> Brb guys
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Theres a small part of me that is going insane at the idea of someone going to a marvel movie as a DC character
<RX-78-SweetieBot> a very small part
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> a bunch of friends went to see the avengers and were asking in line if that was the line to see twilight
<Shamroc> lol
<ScootaChicken> I'm a total noob about comic lore.
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ha
<ScootaChicken> I was actually surprised that Spider Man wasn't in that film.
<ScootaChicken> I was later informed of my noobyness.
<null> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Hahaha! :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: thats because Sony owns spiderman's movie rights still
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wanted to go, sadly was busy that day
<ScootaChicken> The dad in this movie is awesome
<Dken2021> was spiderman ever part of the avengers?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> If sony would have let it expire instead of making this rebooted spiderman movie, then we could see spiderman in the avengers
<SteveColt> Dken2021: yup!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat Great and powerful Meanwhile in mane lol
<Meanwhile> Briefly.
<Dken2021> ah
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Dude, nearly every marvel hero has been part of the avengers at some point
<CCCP> ScootaChicken: the grandpa is better
<SteveColt> they still collab occasionally
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-SweetieBot: Was Spider Man in the Avengers according to Marvel lore?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Yes
<IshBestPony> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/035/a/b/the_helements_of_armory_by_locoviscacha-d4oon4j.jpg
<RX-78-SweetieBot> at least once
<ScootaChicken> CCCP: Actually, I think my favourite character is the kid with the glasses
<ScootaChicken> Y'know, of OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD fame
<IshBestPony> ScootaChicken I think he was in the New Avengers
<Dken2021> IshBestPony I think I want that as a shirt
<CCCP> ScootaChicken: the "OH MY GOD" kid?
<IshBestPony> Dken2021 I think I want you
<ScootaChicken> CCCP: indeed
<CCCP> he is awesome
<Dken2021> O_O
*IshBestPony licks Dken2021
<ScootaChicken> IshBestPony: I don't blame you. Dken2021 is pretty damn sexy.
*Dken2021 is licked -_-
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Basically the only marvel heroes that dont join the avengers at some point are ones on other planets, and X-men
<ScootaChicken> Wait wut
<SteveColt> let's have a bronystateregulars orgy!
<ScootaChicken> THE CHOLESTEROL
<CCCP> ...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lets not
<SteveColt> well I'm already undressed
<SteveColt> so this is awkward
<Meanwhile> Goblins eat vegetable matter, quick! GM crops!
<CCCP> trollgy
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SteveColt: go over to #brony for that kind of stuff
<ScootaChicken> I liek #brony
<Dken2021> but they're no fun
<CCCP> I like it too
<CCCP> they are mean to me though :(
<ScootaChicken> #brony has some cool people there, although some of them are a bit weird...
<Meanwhile> some?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Weeeee Preview for the next part of Turnabout Storm
<RX-78-SweetieBot> #brony is like a little slice of 4chan's /mlp/
<RX-78-SweetieBot> a good slice
<Meanwhile> A green slice.
<CCCP> what about #boner Im fairly sure there is a channel with that name
<Meanwhile> rofl
<RX-78-SweetieBot> And then when meanwhile got home to trixie tonight, she gave him a slice of green pie
<SteveColt> greeeeeen
<SteveColt> batman
<CCCP> what if Meanwhile IS trixie?
<Meanwhile> >_>
<Meanwhile> <_<
<Dken2021> O_O
<Meanwhile> No.
*Meanwhile scrunchyface.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wont stop the shipping
<Dken2021> what if he's related to trixie?
<CCCP> :o
<RX-78-SweetieBot> That will increase the shipping
<CCCP> inbred pony children
<Meanwhile> Ew no.
<Dken2021> -_-
<CCCP> im sorry
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> even i think that's weird
<Shamroc> ...all the green
<Bronysith> CCCP: new chapter is up
<Meanwhile> Well that film sucked.
<CCCP> Bronysith: really? link
<CCCP> Meanwhile: no it didn't
<Bronysith> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
<Meanwhile> Yes. It did.
<CCCP> thanks
<Bronysith> for once we agree on something Meanwhile
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol lyra is watching you clop
<CCCP> Meanwhile: it sucked for what it was trying to be
<Meanwhile> It sucked in general.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> there are many movies that are hillariously bad. this was just bad.
<Meanwhile> Bad acting bad plot bad setting bad effects badbadbadbadbad OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD bad.
<SteveColt> like I said before
<Meanwhile> Bad.
<ScootaChicken> 9/10. So bad in every single way that it manages to become incredible.
<SteveColt> the plot was CORNY the acting was WOODEN and the dialogue was PISS
<Meanwhile> Bad.
<ScootaChicken> The fact that a film can be this bad is an accomplishment.
<Dken2021> it's good bad movie night material
<CCCP> i give it a 8/10 funny but horrible
<SteveColt> horrible but hilarious
<Meanwhile> Bad.
<null> And now pony. :)
<CCCP> Meanwhile: worse than trixie?
<Meanwhile> It's about even.
<IshBestPony> fun fact: if you look closely at the skull on the moth in the poster for Silence of the Lambs, you can see that it's made of naked people
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<SteveColt> IshBestPony: you has the best fun facts
*CCCP glomps IshBestPony
<IshBestPony> SteveColt but I only haz one fun fact
<SteveColt> NOW WHO WILL HUG ME?
*CCCP hugs SteveColt
*IshBestPony gives SteveColt a hug that lasts a disturbingly long time
<SteveColt> thanks CCCP and IshBestPony
<SteveColt> and IshBestPony ... such hugs are imposible conmigo
<IshBestPony> SteveColt you mean you don't find it disturbing that my hooves are on your bum
<SteveColt> IshBestPony: I like where this is going
<SteveColt> :3
<CCCP> im leaving now
*IshBestPony licks SteveColt
*CCCP hides
<SteveColt> CCCP: NO
<SteveColt> STAY AND WATCH
<CCCP> D:
*Dken2021 told a story so scary you couldn't help but laugh.
<Meanwhile> Organised chaos.
*IshBestPony seeks out and finds CCCP then drags to a chair and ties to it
<CCCP> IshBestPony: nuuuu!
<SteveColt> Discord: organize chaos eh?
<IshBestPony> Muahahahahahahaha
*Dken2021 accidentally tell a cute, funny story.
*IshBestPony licks CCCP
*CCCP pushes away from IshBestPony
<SteveColt> friendship is witchcraft has made me unable to take this episode seriously
*IshBestPony pulls CCCP towards
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ...is a warcrime
<CCCP> IshBestPony: uh oh

<Meanwhile> I am eternal and have seen the rise and fall of empires.
<CCCP> Meanwhile: is wise
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> here comes the toot
<Meanwhile> As it has been, so shall it be.
<SteveCharb> Meanwhile: I am Ozymandias, king of kings

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile is actually the moustache. It takes humans as hosts.

<SteveCharb> CCCP: Steven Magnet
<Meanwhile> His name is "dragon"

<Meanwhile> Steven isn't a dragon
<Meanwhile> he's a sea serpent
<SteveCharb> CCCP: pretty close to canon
<RX-78-SweetieBot> he was a sea serpent though....
<CCCP> oh okay
<SteveCharb> it's like universal fanon and I think they might call him that in the studio too

<Meanwhile> Indeed.
