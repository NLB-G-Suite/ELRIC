<Arceus-pony|Fancy> So much white
<richfiles> Lyra always swims in style
<Singed_Iz_Brony> thats why he is awesome
<otakon> StinkomanFan: Black Dynamite is what INSPIRED Machete

<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Seapony lyra is watching you clop clop clop
<Syskol> and only 30 minutes of movie
<Combustiblelemons> *shudders*

<Starflash> ok, Im off watching. Be back for machete, I saw this 1 yesterday already~
<otakon> Meanwhile: it's itching, bc you either have a rash or an allergic reaction. If that is the case, the anit-hestamines should help reduce the itch.
<GentleHeaven> id laugh if ten mins later the nazi's reappeared
<SteveCharb> let's continue casting for the Daring Doo version
<Jim> The internet needs a sarcasm font
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Don't quote me on this but apperently Trixie was going to be a boy

<Tom> Episode 20 of season 2 "It's About Time" airs in 6 days, 21 hours, 22 minutes, 16 seconds (Mar 10 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<Supersaga> awwww
<SteveCharb> Daring Doo = Indy
<otakon> Meanwhile: then you must seek medical attention, bc icing it will NOT help
<Fazana> and colt SF in is it the danish?
<RedCaptain> I imagine the shipping would have been 10,000 times worse if Trixie stayed a colt.
<beepbeep> hitler is in the final crusader, if he would be pony, who he would be?
<Blaze7> Caramel as that guy on screen now
<Fazana> HOOOOOONK

<Dken2021> diddutz: failed to get idol, going after the ten commandments, egypt, nazis, and some thing else I don't know about
<Yellowquiet> secks time
<Syskol> YAY!;)
<Cygnus> It's effective...
<Fazana> Right now, I feel the urge to just summon a pony from nowhere and snuggul with eet :3
<Singed_Iz_Brony> LOL
<AgentKalim> He was also in that Jack the Ripper game
<pony_1826> that lady = rarity
<DainbowRash> The ark = Sapphire Statue

<StinkomanFan> Alright, lets get this out of the way. Meanwhile, is it or is it not medical related?
<Jim> I wanna snuggle with ponies
<Pony_9001> I said RAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Czymsim> so we will have more reactions to use when we will talking with you
<Singed_Iz_Brony> did he really play Gimli?
<Meanwhile> It is absolutely medical related.
<RedCaptain> He said WAAAAHHHH
<MisterTwister> Again, this musical theme
<AgentKalim> Yes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai
<Singed_Iz_Brony> just cant see it

<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Aperently Lauren was going to have Apple bloom be alone in her cutie mark quest
<Dken2021> I love this slow theme
<Skrmshsh> the ark = that box that celestia kept the elements in?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wild guess rrhoids
<Phase4> actualy it was more like 01:00
<Yellowquiet> Hiho Superbro !
<Fazana> Hello SuperBrony64.

<Meanwhile> Bingo.
<StinkomanFan> Alright, does it ache?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> knew it
<[ger]Brony1> Deleted scene: Indiana Jones points at his dick.
<Skrmshsh> I mean they're essentially the same thing, wrath of god and the elements of harmony
<Czymsim> Indy is baby!
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> She was asked to include sweetie belle and Scootaloo
<Syskol> sex?
<LightningChaser> stop being a pussty indy

<Dken2021> Hi SuperBrony64, your 64 is showing
<Darf14> Eeyup
<SteveCharb> points to his junk
<StinkomanFan> Oh I saw that in South Park!
<Lambo> These fucking hypocrtis. These action hereos do not show the slightest sign of pain while fighting, and then as soon as a woman touches them, they whimper
<LightningChaser> LOL
<LightningChaser> :d
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dken2021: D:
<Yellowquiet> it is movie night SB
<Supersaga> yea
<pony_1826> :S
<smallfish> *points to dick*
<Singed_Iz_Brony> i guess i never paid enough attention to the voice
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> And Lauren thought the CCC should have had a spin off show
<smallfish> here
<TrixieMuffin> Ok the history of seaponies goes as follows : In the near future FiM will include seaponies and they will be awesome. Bronys will invent timetravel and in an atempt to make earth more like equestria, wipe out dinosaurs and spread the genetic blueprints for ponies and seaponies. those will then in the future past inspire thecreators of MLP.
<MisterTwister> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi SB64.
<Blaze7> <3
*SuperBrony64 covers his 64
<LightningChaser> coulda seen that one comin'
<RedCaptain> I imagine it's the adrenaline talking during fights.
<Fazana> Lambo: it's adrenaline
<Singed_Iz_Brony> but now that i recall it does kinda sound like him

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you need to go to the doctor Meanwhile ~
<MisterTwister> Okay, I sleep now.
<Lambo> No, it is "I want the lady to lay me."
<AgentKalim> guess so
<StinkomanFan> And you're upset because some guy you hate got 1 million bucks while you got Roids
<otakon> Meanwhile: wash with warm soapy water gently and pat dry. try to keep it aired out
<DainbowRash> Hush now quiet now
<beepbeep> bad time to fell asleep.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> A show staring the CCC would have been amusing
<Pony_9001> Her kiss killed him
<AgentKalim> btw he has a welsh accent, not scottish and shit
<Singed_Iz_Brony> ratz
<otakon> StinkomanFan: lol dat South Park
<LordDerpington> DatEpicVoice: Nazis have stolen the Ark of the Covenant, and Indiana Jones is going to get it back.
<Cygnus> He was cummin?
<Syskol> soo fast
<Czymsim> Indy used rest
<LightningChaser> time to rest your sleepy heads
<Rare> A break cannot be gotten

<Lambo> WHAT'S IN THE BOX
<Ohfour> The ark doesn't like swastikas
<Rare> God hates nazis
<Combustiblelemons> burn baby burn.
<Fazana> Indy jones got an amulet, the place gets burnt down, bitch is useless and gets him almost killed twice, he finds snakes, and my ropesnake, gets the staffm finds the ark and you get the point
<Meanwhile> If coincidentally someone I hate got a million $ I'd kill them.
<Dr_Fumbles1> My connection just dropped, and now I can't even use my name anymore :[
<AgentKalim> Rats have ships
<SteveCharb> like I said, god does not like being in a nazibox
<Skrmshsh> it was the fire of ominous foreshadowing
<AgentKalim> rats OWN ships

<ThatsAShinySky> dammit story
<Singed_Iz_Brony> i love how no one notices him
<ThatsAShinySky> Elation turned into crushing despair in a second as Dash’s jaw fell open, along with everypony else’s. This was it, she realized - this was how it would end. And the worse feeling of all was that if the other pony had no qualms about dropping a thousand bits on an auction, then Dash never stood a chance from the beginning. Even Rarity was surprised; few residents of Ponyville had that kind of coin to drop and she could not imagine any of th

<Ohfour> Indy can breathe underwater
<RedCaptain> Das Boot crossover
<Yellowquiet> Tauchen !
<Darf14> Indy better hopes that the sub doesnt dive
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> There were plans for an episode centered around Big Macintosh. The episode was supposed to have little dialogue coming from the star character. However, it was dropped for a probable number of reasons (namely, that silence can get very boring).
<GentleHeaven> this music makes anything interesting and dramatic
<Twitch> DAMN he can hold his breath!
<DatEpicVoice> dat boot
<Lambo> Tauchen das Uboot
<DatEpicVoice> y

<Singed_Iz_Brony> heres the FLAG again
<Singed_Iz_Brony> lol
<LordDerpington> It could've worked. They did a whole episode of Dexter's Laboratory with only two lines of dialogue in it.
<SteveCharb> they were black, skrmshssh
<LightningChaser> Maybe it's all secretly and erased from history
<Supersaga> i whould play it when i walk to make the day epic
<Syskol> this is better, you will watch pony later

<Dr_Fumbles> Green is not your color... I think
<otakon> I wouldn't mind
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saw is more gory than Machete, but Machete is more interesting.
<Cptn|Dashie_Dashie> I wonder how rich Rarity must be to get a spa treatment everytime she feels a pimple coming on..
<Unicorn_Gundam> PONIES?
<Czymsim> Fluttershy's for Syskol

<ryaxnb__> Luna is not a sadsack, she's not evil, she's just... slightly a more muted, non-evil version of her evil personality
<Rare> I wonder if HL2 episode 3 is finally going to be released this year
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> EspyLacopa yep but is kinda hard to do that in chat don't you think ?

<ROHKARA> Bonbon probably has multiple sisters each with the same cutie mark
<Whiskra> Spoiler: Bon-Bon had a new voice in the most recent episode
<GentleHeaven> wait, that was a continuation on bob bon's voice!
<EspyLacopa> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: At least it wasn't Cupcakes.
<Syskol> NO! Fluttershy is worst pony

<robotdragon6> dat cult of personality
<EspyLacopa> Or Spiderses.
<Phase4> read past sins, its worth it
<LightningChaser> but I guess it's a subjective thing

<LightningChaser> true :O
<robotdragon6> o...o...am i missing anything
<Syskol> Trixie is the best pony, and Fluttershy is the worst

<Nyst> Is this the first time Segal played a villain?
<derp> better defense
<Suinide> Only selling them together? As the three pack?
<Jim> Use the other hand to cast spells!
<meh> this is too epic not to own
<Machete_Jones> I could forgive Trixie before Gilda.

<Azureflames66> I think Luna plays too much Skyrim, with all those shouts....
<TOY_PON3> Aircrafter: I was not aware.
<AgentKalim> Don't you remember? Pinkie is preten ding to bescared ffrom the beginning. She mentions it later
<Cypresswolf> why are they afraid when they met Luna at the party after NM's defeat
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm not sure if she gains or loses points for that
