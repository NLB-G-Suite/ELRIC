<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, time for Doom :)
<Meanwhile> I hate avocadoooooo. T^T
<RaveBrony> That game :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: It makes more sense than the origonal, along woth being waaay more awesome
<Ninjazz> Dat DOOM!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What difficulty? :3
<RaveBrony> Im not big on cheese, lol :D
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: That's probably because it adheres to the manga. :P
<Ninjazz> MEGA-VIOLENCE!
<MadSurge> Hello Gold_Demona!
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Whereas the original series did not.
<Gold_Demona> Ohai MadSurge!
<RaveBrony> Thowse difficulties
<RaveBrony> *Those
<Ninjazz> Ultra-Violence*
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Wrek> 05ultraviolence or no violence
<DashWithRainbows> inb4 SB has more deaths than Wrek playing Abuse.
<Gold_Demona> lol Ultraviolence. Clockwork Orange reference much?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: In the words of Major armstrong, *punches through a brick wall* INDEED!
<Ninjazz> Oh gawd now I want to play again.
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64: get a perfect score and i will be very roud of you
<Wrek> 05p*
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: I've never read the manga or watched Brotherhood though, so all I know about the differences is what I hear about secondhand. =/
<Meanwhile> Wrek your salad would have to be pretty damn good to rekindle my lost faith in cheese.
<Ninjazz> >Hate cheese
<Ninjazz> Blasphemy.
<Gold_Demona> D:
<Wrek> 05Meanwhile I usually make it togetehr with some kinf of karé and pasta of some sort
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CRUD ><
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How do I get a perfect score? o.o
<RaveBrony> Dat spoiler
<Meanwhile> I can't pretend to know what karé is, but pasta's nice.
<Wrek> 05you pick up all tiems that arent health
<Wrek> 05you kill all mosnters
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: you know how alchemy is powered by soul-energy?
<Wrek> 05and you find all secterts
<Ninjazz> SuperBrony64, not die for one. :p
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah
<RaveBrony> You lose score for picking up health? o.o
<Klumzeedragon> Now I want play DOOM. I only got it foh the 360 though. I cant go all old school.
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: I think they have the oldschool games on Steam.
<Gold_Demona> Besides, PC is the best way to play Doom.
<Wrek> 05protip. buy all the classic dooms on steam
<Wrek> 05its the cheapest place to buy the WADS
<RaveBrony> How much?
<Wrek> 05then get a 3rd party emulator and extract the WADS from your steam folder
<Gold_Demona> You can do WADS on Steam? O_O
<Wrek> 05then play on the 3rd party engine
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DArn :<
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: well in brotherhood, If you condense the souls of multiple individuals, they crystallize and form the P-stone
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64!
<Ninjazz> Such as?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Having those health packs there hurt me though :/
<Wrek> 05i believe in you!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<Vordox> Doom is TOO HARD for players nowadays, Wrek :P
<Meanwhile> Even if you can't believe in yourself, believe in the Wrek that believes in you!
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Yeah I saw it on there. :D But I meant like, I cant old school console it.
<Ninjazz> And then SB pulled out his fists in a gun fight.
<Meanwhile> Is this a man or a monkey? Hairy arms much.
<Ninjazz> He wears gloves.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:/
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: To my knowledge only the original Doom got a console release. SNES I think
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I may just do that. But I already own the bugger on xbox. I dont know if I should buy i again for pc. :D
<Ninjazz> He's a man. Monkies don't pull off the glove look.
<RaveBrony> D:
<Meanwhile> Dat moonwalk
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Doom 2 came out on the GBA
<Meanwhile> Try and watch that and not hear MJ Billy Jean.
<RaveBrony> Constant Shuffle
<Wrek> 05if you give up SB i will show you how its done
<RaveBrony> :D
<Wrek> 05and you wouldnt want that
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Wrek> 05so go ahead and get a purfect score! :D
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is best at Doom.
<Ninjazz> But SB is playing on a controller, Wrek. And you know how you feel about controllers.
<Klumzeedragon> That confindent Wrek. :D
<MadSurge> No music though, fgsfds
<Ninjazz> ^
<Meanwhile> >Playing on a controller
<Gold_Demona> Ew, playing Doom with a controller?
<Meanwhile> Well there's your problem.
<Ninjazz> Well, this IS an Atari.
<RaveBrony> I dont think id be good at DOOM, lol
<Gold_Demona> I'm not good at Doom, but I love to play it anyway
<SuperBrony64> 11,02><
<MadSurge> Do it with a keyboard, like a real man!
<RaveBrony> :D
<MadSurge> Ded
<Meanwhile> This is like when I first tried to play Unreal Tournament...
<Gold_Demona> I always start Doom 2 with IDDQD cuz I'm lame like that. :P
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64: use strafe!
<Ninjazz> Nostelgia just hit me.
<Klumzeedragon> I've always been a console gamer cause I never really had a good computer that could play anything. Only game I was really good at on the computer was Unreal Tournament. :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> I've always had both console and PC growing up.
<Meanwhile> Two words for you Klumzeedragon. Xan Kriegor.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: the biggest thing about brotherhood I think is that the homonculi work differently
<Gold_Demona> I never understood how Doom worked on consoles because there were so many keyboard commands involved on the PC version.
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: NO! :D
<Ninjazz> Try turning the safty off.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: I thought it weird that there weren't homonculi for all the sins like there were in the original series.
<Wrek> 05uhm SuperBrony64
<Wrek> 05you CAN pick up health
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: And the Pride/Wrath thing confused the crap out of me.
<Wrek> 05but they arent counted on the items percentage
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<JRP> fun fact: most doom console ports were based after this port
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I missed an enemy? D:
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Actually there are still 7, 1 for each sin
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64 what me to show hows it done? x3
<Kandarihu> Aw
<SuperBrony64> 11,02><
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But you said no health? :<
<Meanwhile> You'll get him next time Super.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Okie, I'll watch you, you wanna stream? :)
<JRP> wrek how do i get that special mde thingy with the emnemys
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: and I could clear up your confusion if you dont mind spoilers
<Wrek> 05i said health pickups dont coutn to the item pecentage
<Ninjazz> Dat clickety clackity Doom music.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I did that entire level without any health...do I get bonus points? D:
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile. And lol. http://rekkin92.deviantart.com/art/Xan-Kriegor-the-pony-champion-211001062
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah that's alright. I'll probably watch it eventually on Netflix anyway, since both series are on there.
<Wrek> 05not according to the score. you aslo missed 2 secrets
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well...lemme try again ;^;
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Eeeeeviiiiil.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i don't know where the other secret are ;A;
<Wrek> 05sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02secrets*
<therainbowvortex> good night everypony gota go beat the crap outa someone tomorow
<Kandarihu> Practice makes perfect
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: The evilist!
<Wrek> 05many secrets are revealed ocne you "beat the level and stand next to the end button
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night therainbowvortex :)
<Meanwhile> Have fun therainbowvortex.
<Wrek> 05instead of hittign the end button
<Wrek> 05re-explore the mnap
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Git always took the invis belt.
<therainbowvortex> eeyup no one dose what he did to my sister
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Okay :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So wait, you said I could pickup the items?
<JRP> wrek where is that button ?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02health*
<Wrek> 05yes
<Meanwhile> This is a much different game with Thriller on in the background...
<Wrek> 05you NEED
<Wrek> 05to pick up everythign you can
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Only up to episode 34, which is just enough time fot us to meet sloth! how fun.
<Wrek> 05to get the items score
<SuperBrony64> 11,02OOOOOO
<Moopy> Moooooooo!
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Wasn't there a Redeemer on that map as well?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I thought you said to get 100% without grabbing health :<
<Wrek> 05heh
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05health pickups do not add to the item score
<Wrek> 05casue its possible to beat without takign damage
<Wrek> 05makes sense right?
<Klumzeedragon> You need the armor though man.
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Somewhere near the top I think, the belt was in the exposed part of the lower ring.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02yeah...but like that one passage, I think I need to grab the health in order to get by it to grab the other items :/
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: That's right. :D Could enemys grab that thing? I forget now, it's been a good 12 years since my last play. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Have you heard what brotherhood sloth is like?
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Same, but I got blanked enough times by invisible flak cannons to remember. >_<
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Nope.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: want a description?
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: oh well, you will see soon enough. yes precious, you will see...
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: I just remember that guy being more than enough to make me shake my fists in rage. But after winning I do remember having fun as the robot team. :D And after beating it a few times having fun with all the console cheats for shits and giggles.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: LOL, yes eventually. XD
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: And fun times were had by all. Except Xan. Because really, screw that guy.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: I do plan to watch it eventually. I just haven't felt the drive to yet. :P
<Vivix> Supinhere?
<Jmo> Dat Vivix
<JRP> wrek how does one do co-op?
*Vivix clings to Jmo and snoozes
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: God mode. All weapons. Inifite ammo. And then just Redeemer the crap out of him to make him pay. :D
<Wrek> 05ok SB

<Wrek> 05pick up aal times
<Wrek> 05dotn hit the button

<RaveBrony> o.o
<Ninjazz> Ah. The secret room.
<Ninjazz> THAT secret room.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:O*
<Wrek> 05careful
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Redeemer on...aw what's it called? Facing Worlds?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Awww yeah :D
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, best. map. ever.
<Wrek> 05theres 1 more secret
<Gold_Demona> Ohey Jmo, I noticed you faved a chunk of my Nuzlocke comic. :P
<Ninjazz> Just a straight line of death.
<Wrek> 05toggle run
<Vivix> zig zag acid room, made me think "doom?" and aww yeah stream said it wass
<Jmo> I went through every single page of them >>
<Jmo> I wants moar ;~;
<Wrek> 05wait
<Wrek> 05for it to raize
<Wrek> 05now run as fast as you can back to the secret room
<Wrek> 05and up the elevator
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Aye. Aim with the sniper, switch to redeemer and fire.
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Yes! That was the. best. level. I had most of my fun rampages there. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: http://derpy.me/1oXy5
<RaveBrony> Ugh. Ive got updates. Brb
<Vivix> Unreal tournament?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<Wrek> 05now lets see
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, always fun watching a nuke go off.
<Wrek> 05did you get the button at the very start of the map?
<Wrek> 05where the armor was
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: lol, I plan to work on the next page today. So I might have it up by tomorrow or the next day. =)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No D:
<Jmo> Huzzah :3
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Yeah, That's what we're talking about. :P
<Ninjazz> Dat wasteful use of ammo.
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Fave character?
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Ninjazz> To the side.
<JRP> Wrek: its gone
<Wrek> 05the map is different here
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, I used to use the timestop cheat, and surround the enemy with a cluster of redeemers, then watch from afar
<SuperBrony64> 11,02There's a button here?
<Ninjazz> Side of the stairs.
<JRP> fun fact: most doom console ports were based after this port
<Wrek> 05check sides of stairs
<Ninjazz> Not up the stairs, on the side.
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Jmo> Gold_Demona: Out of all of them?
<Ninjazz> I guess button knew magic.
<Vordox> Explore dem rooms, SuperBrony64 :D
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: I will :3
<Wrek> 05guess they removed that?
<CrimsonPhoenix> how cute
<Jmo> Gold_Demona: Dema or Professor MacRowan :P
<Ninjazz> Probably.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64 playing Doom
<Wrek> 05ok then
<Wrek> 05sb if they removed that butotn
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Yup. :P Best thing ever. That or a few well placed flack shots around every enemy and let it all fly at once. :P
<Wrek> 05you got them all
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: LOL, yeah. I love Mac. XD
<JRP> wrek this port is diffrent
<Vordox> Wrek: Removing in a port...? When it's part of hhe game mechanic, like WHUT.
<JRP> most doom console ports were based after this port
<Jmo> Too funny :3
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, haha yes, man I could have fun for hours with that cheat
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I hope it was removed :<
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Le pray
<Wrek> 05its ok
<Wrek> 05lets check
<Wrek> 05your score
<Ninjazz> It's probably removed.
<JRP> Ninjazz: it is
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Me too. :D That was like, my main game on the computer as a kid.
<Ninjazz> Well, we'll see.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AWWWW YEAH :D
<Wrek> 05stream died on me

<Ninjazz> I already believe!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02See it? :D
<Ninjazz> Dem zeros.
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, yeah, I played a lot of that. Never tried it online though- hm
<Meanwhile> Success.
<Gold_Demona> Yay! Perfect score!
<JRP> wrek y u no co-op
<Klumzeedragon> Great success!
<Kandarihu> Congrats
<Wrek> 05JRP: casue coop is for babies in doom
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You can link this game with another Atari Jaguar to play Co-op mode :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or Deathmatch :D
<JRP> wrek where can i get that mode you alwas play?
<Ninjazz> Dat music.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thanks for the tip about secret being revealed after entering the final room in a level :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek* :)
<Ninjazz> For some reason, I like hearing it like that.
<Meanwhile> Nice background art.
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: I have. It's pretty much the same. But instead of silly bots you got people with mad skill. :D Cause you'd always have one or two bots who would do nothing but jump as they moved through the map. :D
<Ninjazz> Ffs, the time when we had to choose which soundcard we had to hear things properly.
<Ninjazz> Or differently.
<Moopy> Im off to bed everypony see yall later ok.........peace
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Moopy. Sleep well.
*Vivix peace sign
<Vordox> Ninjazz: SOUND BLASTER!
<JRP> SuperBrony64: come back
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Getting tired, so I'm tuning out, thanks for watching everypony ^_^
<Ninjazz> Vordox, ALWAYS!
<Klumzeedragon> Later Moopy! :)
<Wrek> 05wait SuperBrony64"!
<Moopy> eeyup
<Wrek> 05LET ME SHOW YOU THE LEVEL ASWELL!
<Meanwhile> Thanks for streaming Super.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll watch :D
<MadSurge> Bye SuperBrony64!
<Gold_Demona> Uh oh. Wrek's going to show off now. :P
<Vordox> GG SuperBrony64 !
<Ninjazz> Thanks for the classics, SB.
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Btw, here's the Atari Jaguar :3 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Atari_jaguar4.jpg
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks for the stream SuperBrony64. But adter Wrek, you need to sleep. :P I do too.
<Ninjazz> AVGN said it sucks.
<Vivix> You weren't on an emulator?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AVGN can go suck it :)
<Vordox> Ninjazz: AVGN is subjective
<Ninjazz> And funny.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Here's what they did with the Atari Jaguar when it failed :3 http://archive.insertcredit.com/news/022004/hotrod.jpg
<Vivix> I like AVGN when he geeks out and stops making jokes-
<Ninjazz> I do too.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It became dental imaging equipment :D
<Ninjazz> Presents something more to appreciate than crude humor.
<Vordox> Vivix: You mean poop jokes most of the fans doesn't like? :P
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: Looks like a soap dispenser youd see in a public bathroom.
<Wrek> 05ok hit refresh!
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Oh lawl, THE WORLD was not ready!
<Klumzeedragon> Dun did doed it!
<Vivix> Ninjazz, yeah, especially when the consoles or games have weird histories or anecdotes
<Meanwhile> You'll get DOOM in your teeth.
<Vivix> Vordox, yeeah
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Also! Have you heard what sony did?!
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: THEY ARE MAKING A VR item!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: IKR :O
<Vordox> (Just like Nintendo did about 20 years ago)
<Meanwhile> VR Troopers.
<Ninjazz> Vivix, honestly, that was the reason why I subscribed. It wasn't his humor, but the way he presented how a game failed and how it compared to others that didn't.
<JRP> wrek
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I hear Wrek :D
<JRP> wrek what doom port is it?
<Meanwhile> VR items. Wonder how long that'll take to fail.
<Vordox> Dat music...
<Vivix> Ninjazz, yeaah, totally. I like some of his other geekstuff too- like boardgame james or what it is- less jokes on that though
<Noir> Derpy!
<Klumzeedragon> Fisticuffs!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ewww...PC version looks bad :P
<Vivix> o u
<Vordox> <--- The game that made Strafing a MUST have in 3D games
<Meanwhile> So does everything you play Super, we still put up with it.
<Ninjazz> Vivix, eyup! Need to catch up more on his videos.
<Klumzeedragon> Burn. :D
<Ninjazz> ...so...
<JRP> wrek is this gzdoom or that other one
<Vivix> I can't remember strafing in doom
<Ninjazz> ...
<Vivix> alt arrow?
<Gold_Demona> I think you hold down control to strafe
<Meanwhile> I wonder how many times he's played this...
<Ninjazz> This is REALLY making me want to play again.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anypony can play it on the PC, but it takes a silly filly to play it on the Jaguar \:3/
<Vivix> It's been quite a while since I played doom
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: With money and a family that didn't threw his games out
<Vordox> Wrek: I wanna see you try and do this speed in Quake 1 :P
<Meanwhile> You're too casual to play it properly Super. :P
<Wrek> 05oh right theres an ammo pack back up at the spawn
<Klumzeedragon> Ooooo.
<Vordox> LAWL
<Gold_Demona> It's been a while for me too, so I can't remember if it's Alt of Cntrl that lets you strafe
<Ninjazz> Dat insult.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I held onto my games for dear life
<Ninjazz> This is the HL1 engine?
<Vivix> Oh nono
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Never trading them in for next to nothing in return and always keeping the boxes...until my parents threw the SNES and N64 boxes away on me ;~;
<Vivix> hl1 was based on quake engine
<Ninjazz> You know what I mean.
<Meanwhile> That's fairly traumatising. No wonder you play on the Wii.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Know the feel man. :(
<Vordox> Is this Ultra violent, cause he's not dying... >.<
<Ninjazz> Because he has Wrek mode on.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I got my Atari Jaguar (with box) from someone with like 20 games (some with boxes), a few Jaguar CD games, 3 controllers and the rare A/V cable for the system for $200 ^-^
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: :O Ouch! My N64 boxes and manuels were tossed recently too. Still got my system and all my games as much at that counts for. :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Klumzeedragon: Awesome :D
<Vivix> All of the improved engine versions are based on the original doom engine, not related to the hl1 engine, I think
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: AVGN says they break easily
<JRP> SuperBrony64: did you jagua cd work?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek: you own at this game :o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Jaguar CD breaks easily, not the Jaguar system itself
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Nah, he's playing it on PC; not Console, it's way easier :P
<Gold_Demona> I'm pretty sure they're not related, because HL1 is in ACTUAL 3d, whereas the Doom engine is faux 3d.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Boo-Yah MothaF***er!!!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't have the Jaguar CD add-on unfortunately :<
<Ninjazz> What I want to do now... Is find out which port/ver/copy/etc Wrek is playing and replay again.
<Vordox> The feck happened?
<Klumzeedragon> Spinal Tap!
<Vordox> I NEVER saw that happen...
<Vordox> Ever
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chainsaw tiem \:3/
<Meanwhile> There be blood and giblets everywhere.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I wish I had the Jaguar CD addon :<
<Vordox> Is this an updated version?
<Vivix> Gold_Demona, yeah originaly, but like Doomsday engine can look like hl1 engine, but is not related at all. I don't think doom engine was developed into quake engine- but quake engine is the foundation for Goldsource engine
<Vordox> Cause I never seen the insta kill fist thing
<DoctoDoctorWho> FanFiction Has been approved and is ready to read!
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: I think this is just the steam port.
<Vordox> Cause I never seen the insta kill fist thing
<Vordox> IS THIS STEAM!?
<Vordox> Feck this game then
<Vordox> I prefer the REAL games
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, Wrek is our personal expert in Doom
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek is pretty cool :3/
<Meanwhile> Hipster Vordox.
<Vordox> No
<Vordox> It's not HIpster
<Vordox> It's respect for the original creators
<Vivix> Anti hipster movement is led by hipsters
<Meanwhile> Would you like a latté?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I see. I've never owned Quake, so I don't remember what that one was like.
<JRP> SuperBrony64: can you play asajsjaljsdlkaj
<Klumzeedragon> Did not know you could meat sheild in DOOM.
<Vivix> Gold_Demona, I only played the demo- but yeah that was full 3d ish, no mouselook though I think
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP: I don't has dat game :<
<Vordox> This isn't Doom, this is Doom + Expansion, Which doesn't exist. ><
<DoctoDoctorWho> Guys my fic is done!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox Skyrim is in steam and yet everyone mods it
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: It's not the same game.
<Vordox> Once the end is done, and the game is shipped, that's the game.
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: Send that link on over!
<CrimsonPhoenix> You really do despise mods
<Vordox> No
<Vordox> I love mods
<DoctoDoctorWho> Come on down! http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49494/Blueblood-Un-jerked
<Vordox> But games that are classic shoudl not be modded and released as officials
<Wrek> 05lets hope the servers are up
<Prince_Blueblood> Bah humbug.
<Wrek> 05id love to play this with you SB
<Wrek> 05but i knowi youre not much for PC gaming
<Meanwhile> That's putting it mildly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, why not?
<Vivix> I don't know if the steam version is unmodified, but I would believe it would be made to run on w7 and that's it
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Respect to the original Creators
<Vivix> like how they added the fixes to broken sword in steam
<Wrek> 05uh no Vordox
<Vordox> AND, of course, for it's Culture
<Wrek> 05its brutal doom
<Wrek> 05its a mod
<Vivix> otherwise it would not work at all
<Vordox> Oh
<Wrek> 05steam has the original wads
<Vivix> yes
<Wrek> 05nothing more nothing less
<Vordox> Someone said it was the Steam release
<Wrek> 05then they had no clue what they were talkign about
<DoctoDoctorWho> Prince_Blueblood: well, that was unexpected.
<Vivix> I think--you said that
*Vivix wasn't paying attention
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah no clue
<Wrek> 05i ripped the WADS from my steam purchase
<Gold_Demona> dem typing sounds. :D
<Vordox> Good, then all is fine with the world. :P
<Prince_Blueblood> Bah humbug.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I play PC gaming, so we can play together sometime :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I just like playing old retro consoles :3
<Meanwhile> Like the Wii.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: The feel of the controller
<Vordox> (And then the irony of Microsoft and Sony PLaystation comes into play)
<Klumzeedragon> Vordox: I just said he bought it on Steam. Sorry about that. :$
<Vordox> Klumzeedragon: Well it's good, I got the real info now. And it stills supports the correct release, which is good =P
<thegt90> whos streaming
<Vivix> Wrek
<Kandarihu> Oh, I thought you didn't do roms.
<thegt90> who is streaming
<Meanwhile> Gutted.
<Klumzeedragon> Argh. But it is time for bed for real this time. DoctoDoctorWho I shall read your fic when I wake up. :P
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Aw... I was going to wish you happy fragging.
<Meanwhile> I think this game needs a Commander system.
<Kandarihu> Oh, I just refreshed the stream and found that Wrek took over the embed
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Clumsylizard. Sleep well.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Klumzeedragon: I look forward to comments!
<Ninjazz> HO SHEET.
<Meanwhile> Night Klumzeedragon.
<Ninjazz> Awww, no Planetside?
<Wrek> 05beta servers are locked
<Meanwhile> Servers are down.
<Wrek> 05they unlock later tonight
<Ninjazz> Goddamnit.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Thanks. :P And of course DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<Ninjazz> That is one of the few games that I would buy an entirely new PC just to play.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: SC2?
<Meanwhile> Go to bed Klumzeedragon.
<Klumzeedragon> FINE! Thanks for the stream Wrek!
<Meanwhile> Bah, I can't hear over the sound of someones lawn mower. ¬¬
<Phase4> 00,02i just tried to sign up for an itunes account without a credit card
<Vordox> OH SHIT QUAKE
<Vordox> I know these maps inside out :D
<Ninjazz> Waiwatiwatiwatiwati.
<Phase4> 00,02its an absurdly complicated process
<Ninjazz> Quake?
<Phase4> 00,02apple REALLY wants your credit card info
*Vivix opens stream
<Gold_Demona> Quake! =D
<Vivix> [12:30] #bronystate Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set)
<Vivix> That's new
<Vordox> Is this modded, some things looks different, Wrek
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, no its not :P
<EspyLacopa|2> Superspeed Wrek!
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Only a matter of time before they take over the world.
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, your just seeing it because of your client
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, try log in a different country of iTunes
<MadSurge> Quake? Only played 2 :O
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, nah, its google thats gona take over the world
<Vordox> <--- Quake became big in Sweden, if you people see it :D
<Ninjazz> Quake 2 is best Quake.
<Vivix> Well, it's first time I've seen it- probably just never done it before
<Ninjazz> But goddamn is Quake amazing.
<Meanwhile> Never played quake.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, Apple and Google alliance how doom are we?
<Wrek> 05only mod here is the openGL renderer isntead of software renderer
<Vordox> Lawl, even know the Key Jump :D
<Vivix> iTunes- I would have gotten it for MLP, but they don't let us europeans in yet, so-- can't be bothered
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, apple and google would never work together
<Vivix> ^
<Ninjazz> Two evil masterminds coming together?
<Ninjazz> Bah.
<Vordox> You played this alot too, wh Wrek XD
<Vivix> Google is--good guys usually
<Meanwhile> I'm pretty sure this is a video
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: WalMart and EA?
<Vivix> Apple is--alright, but a bit crueler
<Ninjazz> Duuuuuude. If Wrek-no, ANY plays Quake 2 on stream, the world is COMPLETE.
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, my head just hurt thinking about that.
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, no, apple is jerk
<Gold_Demona> I'd say Microsoft is more evil than Apple
<Phase4> 00,02they do not care for the customer
<Phase4> 00,02iphones are portable itunes stores
<Vordox> Phase4: It's better that way
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<Ninjazz> Not like, "Too much thinking", like I just thought of something only the Devil himself could handle.
<Vordox> Gn SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Vivix> I wouldn't reaaally--agree, I like microsoft. But they aren't really--people minded?
<Meanwhile> Night Super.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, SuperBrony64|Zzz. Sleep well.
*SuperBrony64|Zzz licks Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Phase4> 00,02._.
<Ninjazz> Dat Phasereaction.
<Vivix> Phase4, true- they're more closed down, more..like a virtual china
<Vordox> Phase4: If you care bout the customer, you'll never get anywhere in technical progression
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02You taste like hate o-o
<Meanwhile> Well, that's creepy.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Apple is GOOD O-O
<Meanwhile> But not as creepy as this. http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Wrek...
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02What is that?
<Vivix> Apple is good for those who want it, obviously, but they're not like.. hippies running in the field being all open and honest
<Vordox> You sure you playing?
<Meanwhile> That's an ogre spider.
<Gold_Demona> At least Apple doesn't make you rebuy your OS if you need to reinstall it.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: This is a video.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love Apples
<Meanwhile> As in, from youtube.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02And THAT's why I covered my hand over the image...
<Vordox> Oh thank god, Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> ....
<Ninjazz> LOL.
<Vivix> I bought Windows 7, whenever I reinstall I pay nothing
<Vordox> I'm starting to see a pattern of mechanical and mathematical though proccesses...
<Ninjazz> Dat kick.
<Meanwhile> That's hardly a shock image/
<Vordox> thought*
<Ninjazz> You scared poor SB, Meanwhile. I think it counts. :<
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02A lot of people don't like spiders ;~;
<Ninjazz> ^
<Vivix> True
<Meanwhile> SB is scared of his own reflection.
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, i have a long list of things that apple products suck but meh
<Meanwhile> Besides, I got that picture from dari when he posted it in here last night.
<Vordox> ROCKETJUMPING :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> BUY SOME APPLES
<Vivix> Mods get kicked occationally too
<Phase4> 00,02also a much shorter list of why android sucks but thats mostly for technical reasons
<Vivix> hehe
<Ninjazz> Looks liek Dari has some splainin to do.
<Vivix> Everything has bad parts, and you just choose what's the most important to you
<Gold_Demona> It can be debated which one of the two is more evil (Apple vs Microsoft). We can agree that they're both very evil. But in my opinion, Microsoft is worse
<Ninjazz> So much want to play these games again.
<Vivix> I can't really agree with or use apple products, but that's my perspective
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Dari likes insects :<
<Meanwhile> Spiders aren't insects.
<Phase4> 00,02microsoft has been getting less and less evil over time
<Vivix> I don't think Microsoft is evil at all- really
<Phase4> 00,02but only part of it
<Phase4> 00,02hence windows 8
<Vivix> I mean sure Gates was crazy teenager when they started-
<Meanwhile> This is an insect. http://i.imgur.com/4xEuq.gif
<Phase4> 00,02which doesnt know what it wants to be and sucks all over
<Vivix> hehe
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I remember when my Materials professor showed a picture of a spider's face closeup on the large projector screen...I think I nearly passed out ;^;
<Vordox> Phase4: Give back Win 95 but stable.
<Vivix> true, but I don't think W8 is made to replace W7, but to suplement it
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: You obviously never had to deal with having to reinstall Windows.
<Vivix> I have, numerous times Gold_Demona
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its called 'windows nt'
<Vordox> Phase4: Windows NT?
<Wrek> 05waht Vordox, dont think id manage such a perfect run? :P
<Vivix> I payed my license for W7, and I never payed anything more- ever
<Meanwhile> Oh come on that's not fair.
<Ninjazz> The amount of pictures Meanwhile has at the ready worries me.
<Vordox> Wrek: I'm not daring you to do it, cause I know you'll do it XD
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: How is it not evil f=to force you to rebuy Windows just to reinstall the damn thing when you have a perfectly legal copy?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, it went nt->2000->xp->vista->7
<Gold_Demona> to*
<Vordox> Phase4: AH 2000!? GET IT AWAY GET IT AWAY!
<Vivix> Gold_Demona, they didn't to me
<Phase4> 00,02nt is the closest thing to 95 that can be called an operating system
<Meanwhile> How about squid? Is squid alright? http://i.imgur.com/bPd26.png
<Vivix> I think that's either a mixup, or a onetime license or one use license thing
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I've ALWAYS had to rebuy Windows. How do you manage to dodge it?
<Vivix> which you might get when you buy a computer from dell or something
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, 2000 > vista
<Vordox> GASP
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I don't trust clicking on your links again Meanwhile ;^;
<Vivix> I bought it from windows webpage, and I just reinstall it and use the serial I got
<CrimsonPhoenix> You guys want a shock image?
<Meanwhile> It's only a squid.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma6d5nEjKq1ralkmro5_1280.jpg here's one
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|Zzz: you want a more cheerier thing-=
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: We build our computers from parts and buy our own full copies of Windows.
<Vivix> Same here-
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, XD
<Ninjazz> Serriously, Wrek, do you bhop?
<Vivix> I have no idea why you had to buy it more than once, but I have never had to
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: By logic we should just be able to use the discs we have to reinstall Windows.
<Ninjazz> When you play CS or CSS?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I don't trust anypony now ;^;
<EspyLacopa|2> CrimsonPhoenix: That goddamn yeti.
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's no escape on the Yeti monster
<CrimsonPhoenix> NO ESCAPE
<Vivix> yes, of course. I only use one disc that we share in the family, and we use our own licenses and keys
<Phase4> 00,02you can move a windows install betwene machines 3 times
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....except F
<Wrek> 05do i what Ninjazz?
<Phase4> 00,02after which you legally need to buy a new copy
<Meanwhile> Bunnyhop I think he asked.
<Ninjazz> Wrek, bunny hop.
<Gold_Demona> Vivis: But the activation codes never work more than once, so it's pointless to keep the discs.
<Ninjazz> Yep.
<Vivix> I don't even own my own disk, only my serial
<Vivix> I use someone elses disk
<CrimsonPhoenix> also best insect http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9zkw35J0W1rybm7oo2_500.jpg
<Vivix> It's been used like--10 times
<Gold_Demona> We always have to buy new codes, which costs exactly the same as the full disc copy
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: objection. http://i.imgur.com/EEZ1o.jpg
<Vivix> Weird-
<Vivix> Well I haven't changed computer on my own license yet, only reinstalled
<Vivix> but I've never had that problem. I bought the Home premium license foor.. 200 bucks?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma7kon5hHP1ro1r3fo1_500.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> Beautifull moths
<Gold_Demona> I've gone through several computers since my teenhood. The only time I've never had to spend money to reinstall windows was back when I was still using a pirated copy of Windows 95.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I caught Glaze's virus
<Vivix> Weird-
<Meanwhile> I hate moths. I haven't forgiven that one that flew into my mouth that one time.
<Vivix> I've always built my own computers, but we used a pirate of xp <,< sadly
<Ninjazz> ...
<Vivix> but after xp era we bought everything, never had to repay
<Gold_Demona> Nowadays, any time I reinstall Windows and try to activate it, it says "This code has already been used. Please try another one"
<Ninjazz> Assuming you killed it, Meanwhile, I don't think anyone should. That's an invasion of privacy.
<Vivix> Weiird-
<Ninjazz> Should have sued it.
<Vivix> I might have to watch out for that
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: I didn't, I don't like to kill bugs unless they're bitey. Or particularly offensive to look at.
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, but this one had it coming.
<Ninjazz> He/She. Was. In. Your. Mouth.
<Ninjazz> That's an automatic Liscence to Kill.
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: My husband avoids pirated anything like the plague. :P
*Vivix hugs Jmo
*Jmo pats Vivix
<Vivix> I do too, well now that I can afford things I do-
<Ninjazz> Wrek, do you play Half-Life like this?!
<Meanwhile> I engaged in mild spastic flailing, but I survived.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Yeah, when you can afford it, it's better that way
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: No, he gets demolished by walkers.
<Vivix> yeah, you--should have more benefits that way too, but relicense sounds odd to me-
<Vivix> I just wonder why I never got it- since we all share the same cd and all
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Vivix> We bought one disk, and 2 licenses outside of it
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Beats me. All the times I've used legal copies of Windows, I've always had to buy another license key.
*Vivix slightly worried about eventual HDD failure now
<Meanwhile> Thomas Stubbgard plays way too much Quake.
<Vivix> but yeah, that's not quite alright. If it's supposed to stop you using several windows on one license- but that shouldn't really be a one time use
<Ninjazz> No such thing as playing too much Quake.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Yeah, it would make more sense to me just to prevent installation on a pirated disc like how most games handle it.
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I like how Cubase handles it, you get an eLicense USB, and you just carry that with you
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: heh, interesting
<Meanwhile> Having the gun in the centre of the screen is very odd.
<MadSurge> Those white yeti things look vicious
<Vivix> so you just--install cubase on everything you own, then plug it into the one you are currently using
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: That's cool. It's like an ID key.
<Vivix> Yeah, it's pretty neat
<Ninjazz> It helps when you're shooting around corners.
<Ninjazz> Like how the Original actually helps you do that in TF2.
<MadSurge> Wait, is Wrek using god mode?
<Meanwhile> Wrek isn't playing.
<MadSurge> Oh
<MadSurge> It's a longplay then?
<Ninjazz> mfw.
<MadSurge> Rocket jumping!
<Meanwhile> I can't use the original in TF2, it's too awkward.
<JunkerKun> Hey guys!
<Ninjazz> So Wrek /isn't/ playing? I have seemed to missed something while my lag spiked. -_-
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: if you mean the 666 armor
<Wrek> 05its a powerup
<Meanwhile> Allo JunkerKun.
<Gold_Demona> lol, Is that seriously what it's called? 666 Armor?
<Ninjazz> Hey, JunkerKun.
<Jmo> SATAAN
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo JunkerKun
<JunkerKun> Whos replay is it?
<Meanwhile> And no Ninjazz, this is a youtube.
<MadSurge> Wrek: like the invincibility sphere but with no visual impairment?
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, it's actually called Invincability.
<Ninjazz> (sp)
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, I see. No wonder this looked so well thought out and planned.
<Gold_Demona> lol, Invincibility sphere. Pick up. Film negative everywhere!
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> So intrusive
<Meanwhile> Wrek's a nerd, but he's not this level of nerd.
<Wrek> 05ans this is the SDa's speedrunnign communitys try at 100% every level as fast as possible
<Vivix> Man- I haven't played Quake since..probably the 90s-
<Vivix> maybe I should get it on steam
<Ninjazz> I still have my disk somewhere.
<Vivix> Speedruns and score getting isn't my kinda thing, but -- that game was fun
<Ninjazz> Computer's too new to play it correctly though.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: SO MUCH WHITE AND GREY
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah! Somebody develop the film already!
<JunkerKun> God damn it! Too much for an Adobe Flash Plugin stability =\
<JunkerKun> Crushed twice already
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh who's streaming?
<Gold_Demona> Time for me to go forage up some breakfast. As well as feed my cats who seem to think they're starving/
<AdamTheDuck> Is this Quake?
<Ninjazz> Well, there you go. You're not supposed to be crushing it.
<Meanwhile> Cats always think they're starving.
<Ninjazz> Unless you meant "crashed".
<Ninjazz> Yes, AdamTheDuck.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Doom, the silent movie
<MadSurge> :D
<Vivix> Cats <3
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, yeah, exactly what I meant X)
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, :p
<Vivix> One of my cats has learned that scratching windows gets my attention. So he's started jumping onto windows when he wants to get inside-
<Vivix> the noise is horrriible
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, I've never got the difference between two of this words =\
<JunkerKun> And besides, my english sucks
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, ah, you're ESL. Pardon me. >.< Crashed in this context means that it failed or didn't execute properly. Crush means when you step on a can or bug.
<Ninjazz> tl;dr - it dun goofed.
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, oh. Now I get it.
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Ninjazz> No doubt more times we can count.
<Ninjazz> than we*
<AdamTheDuck> Aww so Wrek
<AdamTheDuck> 's not actually playing?*
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Vivix> nah
<Ninjazz> Just utubin'.
<Vivix> man the FOV is messing with me
<MadSurge> Did I hear a Hotel Mario noise when he went up the windy shaft? :D
<JunkerKun> Vivix, why? Looks good for me
<Ninjazz> 9 hp.
<Vivix> too sharp
<DoctoDoctorWho> Goodbye everypony!
<Vivix> what is Quake? 75? 70? I can never remember those things
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DoctoDoctorWho
<Ninjazz> Cya, DoctoDoctorWho. Take care.
<JunkerKun> Vivix, nah. I've alway played with high FOV =)
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho, bye!
<Vivix> Hehe I like it--kinda wide and even
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix: Oh you. :P
<Vivix> Quake makes me feel like I'm leaning forward and running
<Gold_Demona> Pardon my ignorance, but what is FOV?
<Vivix> Field of view
<JunkerKun> Vivix, 90 I think
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<JunkerKun> Vivix, at least by default
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, Field of View, pretty much how far horizontally you can see
<Vivix> ah yes, I always confuse the two ends
<Gold_Demona> Right right. Thank you. ^^
<Vivix> but yeah I think I prefer around 75 or 80
<JunkerKun> Vivix, Half-Life's FOV =)
<Vivix> yeaah
<Jmo> o.o
<Ninjazz> ... I don't even remember some of these levels.
<JunkerKun> Vivix, I like about 120. Game looks faster and you actually can see more things on the screen
<Vivix> sometimes, especially in Unreal engine games, I feel like not only the FOV a bit--that ish, but that you can't get close to the walls
<Vivix> Ah yeah, JunkerKun I get that aspect of it- but it stressess mee ouut, it feelsl ike everything is fast
<JunkerKun> Well, in UE you REALLY can't go close to the walls
<Ninjazz> I just keep to regular 90 FOV. That should be standard for most games.
<Vivix> I like it lower-
<Vivix> really? UE has like border around walls and such?
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, actually, I think it is 75 nowadays
<Wrek> 05COD has what
<Wrek> 0545?
<Vivix> 70 I think
<AdamTheDuck> 55 I think
<Wrek> 05right 55
<Vivix> Whaat?
<Ninjazz> 55
<Meanwhile> Nice set of answers...
<Meanwhile> 45. 70. 55.
<Vivix> Didn't notice that-
<Meanwhile> Pick one damnit.
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, and that's being generous.
<Ninjazz> Considering consoles. >_>
<Wrek> 05lesser FOV and bigger gun models
<JunkerKun> Vivix, something like that. I think it is because UE has third person view so models shouldn't cross the walls
<Wrek> 05sure you cans ee anythign as the player
<Wrek> 05but atleast you can render the game on this old piece of shit console
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, huh? COD had FOV lesser than 90? O_o
<Vivix> Oh- yeah. It makes sense, but in FPS it makes UDK and UE feel kinda distant to the details, like you can't touch, only see? If that makes sense
<AdamTheDuck> Just searched on Google, it's at a fov of 65 on console and pc.
<Ninjazz> Oh so much, JunkerKun.
<Ninjazz> Infact, CoD can actually give headaches at just how awkward its FOC is.
<Ninjazz> FOV*
<Wrek> 05JunkerKun: yes
<Wrek> 05CODS FOV is disgraceful
<Vivix> I honestly thouht it was higher
<Vivix> because I didn't get sick from playing it-
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, you can get used to it
<Ninjazz> Me neither, but you can just tell. You don't have ANY peripheral vision.
<Vivix> I only play it like..once every 2 months or so? in average
<Vivix> True
<JunkerKun> Vivix, well you're right here but... I don't like the idea to stand close to the wall, rubbing it with your nose X)
<AdamTheDuck> Depends, do you play on console or PC Vivix ?
<Ninjazz> Both have the FOV locked.
<Vivix> PC, don't own a console
<Ninjazz> Consoles need it to function.
<Vivix> Ah yeah-
<Ninjazz> PC ports are just crap.
<AdamTheDuck> Play any other games?
<Vivix> Hehe
<Wrek> 05good idea
<Vivix> I play mainly SP games, mainly. some KF and RO2. Borderlands 2 when that gets out
<Wrek> 05lets NOT give the PC guys an FOV slider
<Wrek> 05casue we are fucktards
<Ninjazz> Lazy fucktards at that.
<JunkerKun> Vivix, hell yeah, Borderlands 2!
<Vivix> in Skyrim doing FOV change in ini does not work, so you have to set it in console every time
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh Killinf Floor and Red Orchestra!?! YAY
<AdamTheDuck> Killing*
<Vivix> Yeah, hehe
<AdamTheDuck> My 2 favourite games :D
<Vivix> I prefer SP, but those are what I play now adays when MPing
<Vivix> They're pretty fun games
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, well, it may be because of some nuances. Like weapon models being lame or something like that
<Wrek> 05JunkerKun: then they shouldnt even botehr porting
<Ninjazz> Is it me or did sound get a bit quieter?
<AdamTheDuck> At least chat didn't die :P
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, money, my friend, if the game is popelar, they will make port of it =) But then again, they can enchance it a bit =/
<Ninjazz> How can chat die when Quake is on screen?!
<Vivix> JunkerKun, late response, but the closeness to wall depends- in games like Source and Goldsource, it really helps you get that interacting wit hthe worldspawn feel. Jumping and such feel more accurate-
<Meanwhile> I started listening to Power Ranger theme songs so I've got the sound off anyway.
<Ninjazz> Interesting choice in song.
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, by eating a rocket from rocket launcher? =)
<Vivix> COD is like, it used to be something, but now it's like TF2 in war setting, or hldm in same setting
<Meanwhile> I love Power Rangers.
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh Power Rangers, my childhood...
<Vivix> I like it, but- it's old skool dm in modern setting
<Meanwhile> Well, the old ones anyway.
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, I see how that could kill chat.
<Meanwhile> More recent Power Rangers suck.
<Ninjazz> I didn't say it was a bad song. Just interesting.
<Vivix> I'm listening to Unlistenable- finally on spotify
<JunkerKun> Vivix, you too think that COD became s**tty after MW1?
<Vivix> The album that got Steel pole kicked off their label- despite sounding like it would be a massive hit in alterna world
<Vivix> JunkerKun, well, I've only palyed MW1 of the new ones, so MAYBE hehe
<Vivix> I think they made so many MW's because of the single player campaign? But I haven't tried those-
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, CoD died for me after the 3rd one... Loved the first two though :3
<Vivix> COD gets a loot of unneeded hipster hate though
<Vivix> I mean disliking it is one thing, obviously
<Vivix> but sometimes people hate on it for the most bizarre reasons-
<Meanwhile> I'd say the worst thing about CoD is the majority of people who play it.
<JunkerKun> Vivix, yeah, but their SP story and such is a piece of s**t.
<Vivix> True-
<Vivix> Though I've had way friendlier experiencer in cod than Ro2 or BF3, on the servers
<Vivix> JunkerKun, ah? Well, maybe I'll skip the sp on those, hehe
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, COD3... don't even remind...
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh, BF3 community is just as bad in my opinon :/
<Wrek> 05games liek cod and BF3 shouldnt even bother with the SP. but they do and theyre disgusting
<Wrek> 05focus on the MP
<Vivix> It's a good game, but the crowd is so angry and "realism is only way!"
<Vivix> Kinda, I loved BC2 SP
<Wrek> 05and keep the trash away from me
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, are they? I thought BF3 SP was pretty good
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, NOOO
<AdamTheDuck> NO IT WAS HORRIBAD
<Ninjazz> Either way, CoD actually had a better SP than BF3. Even though both sucked, one actually didn't suck as hard.
<Vivix> Aah
<Vivix> but yeah, I'm all for more SP, as--MP isn't my preference
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, hm... well, played it only half of an hour, on GAIKAI =)
<Vivix> Only reason I bought BF3 was my friends, and honestly-
<Vivix> I didn't really enjoy playing it
<JunkerKun> If I tried to run it on my laptop, it would just explode
<Ninjazz> I only wanted BF3 because of Jets.
<Ninjazz> Sweet, sweet jets.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I like driving around
<Vivix> but- yeah I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer experience
<Wrek> 05was it bf2 that signed with destructible buildings?
<Wrek> 05bf3^
<Ninjazz> I would have loved the Helicopters but they made them almost too awkward to fly.
<Ninjazz> Wrek, yup.
<Vivix> bf3 said they would have tons of it, which was kinda nice but it didn't have enough
<Wrek> 05and this is prominent in the multiplayer aswell?
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, EA lied, destructable buildings but half the buildings don't even fall.
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, wasn't it Red Faction 1 =)
<Vordox> Wrek: Go Medal of honour
<Vivix> no it's only prominent on select maps
<Wrek> 05HAH
<Ninjazz> Wrek, it's neat looking, atleast.
<Wrek> 05love it
<Vivix> "It would ruin the player flow if the entire map was leveled" which I feel..is just augh
<Vivix> I want to level the map! I want to walk around in mud and cinderblocks when the battle is over
<Vivix> let me do it!
<Meanwhile> Except it's not always tactically wise to level buildings.
<Ninjazz> Only the vehicular building have destruction.
<Vivix> tactic smactic
<Vivix> in bf3 I never played with a single team that bothered with that-
<Meanwhile> Doesn't take a team to think tactically.
<Vivix> and since the game kinda relies on it, it kinda--was no fun
<Ninjazz> Teamwork? In my game? Non-sense!
<Ninjazz> SPRAY AND PRAY.
<Vivix> Hehe
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, ikr
<Vivix> I like it when it works- but it just didn't happen
<Meanwhile> Ikr. The other day on TF2, our team had 6 spies out of 10 players.
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile, actually, it is. Tactics changes dramatically depending on buildings. And if you destroy enemy's buildings...
<AdamTheDuck> God I remember the first time playing Red Orchestra
<Vivix> and yeah leveling the entire city would be so cool- just ruined battlefield trying to win
<Wrek> 05which is why i love planetside so much so far
<Wrek> 05the teamwork actually works
<Ninjazz> So much want for Planetside.
<Meanwhile> JunkerKun: And where is your cover once you gain that ground?
<Ninjazz> It looks SO promising.
<Vivix> Not sure what planetside is
<Wrek> 05Vivix
<Vivix> all I can think of are giant turtles and old RPGs
<Ninjazz> Vivix, MMO FPS.
<Wrek> 05ill be streamign it again once the beta servers are back up
<Vivix> Ooh-
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile, well... Okay, you got me here =)
<Ninjazz> Eh. I'll shut up and let Wrek demonstrate.
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, new game, very large maps and player count, 200ish a side I think
<Vivix> Nice
<Wrek> 05AdamTheDuck: actually its unlimited so far
<AdamTheDuck> Can't remember the exact details but they were in the hundreds
<Wrek> 05but they can handle fors ure 200 a side ish
<AdamTheDuck> Holy shit unlimited?
<Vivix> but yeah look at ARMA for an example on how realism can--make multiplayer and community unpleasant for average gamers
<Ninjazz> ARMA is an experience.
<Ninjazz> Not a game.
<Vivix> yeah-
<Meanwhile> How do the teams in Planetside work?
<AdamTheDuck> But I like the ArmA experience :<
<Vivix> I kinda like it
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, unlimited? First one had 200 and I thought it is the maximum they can have
<Ninjazz> Not saying it's bad.
<Wrek> 05like "we KNOW we can handle 200 a side, but the game has no physical limit
<Ninjazz> Just that don't expect to just jump in and have fun.
<Meanwhile> Does it assign you a team on character creation and then lock your character to the team?
<Wrek> 05but theres a point where the code needs ooptimizing
<Vivix> but the sp didn't work at all, in either Armas, like.. AT ALL, and all the cars feel like they were written in 2001- no physics- outdated stuff-
<Wrek> 05as for hwo teams work
<Vivix> it's--kinda terrible
<Wrek> 053 factiosn
<Wrek> 05imagine 200 a side
<Meanwhile> Figured that much out, I'm thinking more of keeping the teams balanced.
<Wrek> 05some drive the tank divisions
<Ninjazz> I think MAG was the closest thing to this. Atleast the closest thing I can compare.
<Wrek> 05some use the figther ships
<Wrek> 05then there's dropships
<AdamTheDuck> Mobile Infantry wooooooot!
<Wrek> 05its easier to understand if you see it
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Wrek> 05everythign is player controlled
<Vivix> no npc? mmmm I like
<Wrek> 05you can have squads
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, bleh. I still can't understand how they doing headshots with a gamepad
<Wrek> 05squads have tehir own voice chat
<Vivix> Though, I don't play MMO's, more player controll create for interesting events in mmo worlds
<Gold_Demona> I have returned, and I have foraged eggs and toast. :D
<AdamTheDuck> I'm still curious to seeing how the teamwork will roll out in Planetside considering the amount of players.
<Wrek> 05JunkerKun: easy, its called aim assist
<Wrek> 05all consoel games have it
<Wrek> 05that are fps
<Wrek> 05heck some of them even has it on the PC ports
<Wrek> 05and YOU CANT DISABLE IT
<JunkerKun> @Wrek, yes, but it doesn't helped me when I played D=
<Gold_Demona> I love aim assist. I have terrible aim. =/
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, as a person who has ashamedly played BF3 and CoD to death on the console, I will tell you. 40% luck, 40% practice, 20% game knowledge.
<Vivix> I think FPS on console is awkward- but I grew up with computers
<Jmo> o.o
<Vivix> I remember HL1 had aim assist
<Jmo> Welcome back Gold_Demona
<Vivix> and you could turn it on and off
<Ninjazz> Also, aim assist.
<Wrek> 05build in hackign if you ask me
<Ninjazz> But I turned that off.
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, well then they had to be the luckiest duded in the universe =O
<Vivix> Wrek hehe true
<Meanwhile> Wrek: Do you choose tank/air/infantry on character or is it dynamic?
<Ninjazz> Sometimes, you /can't/ even turn it off.
<JunkerKun> *dudes
<Wrek> 05Meanwhile: you first can pick your class depending on whats needed and your playstyle
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Same here. I've only played a few FPS on consoles, including um... What was that one on N64 with the dude that ran around shooting dinosaurs... Turok?
<Wrek> 05then if you want to pilot a dropship then go ahead
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona, Turok, yeah
<Vivix> Tuurok? Oh yeah I remember that.
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, it's not too hard actually. Sure the gamepad isn't as accurate as the mouse, but it just takes a bit more planning.
<Vivix> that and dinosaur hunter-
<Ninjazz> Turok?
<Gold_Demona> Turok was fun. Never got very far in it though. :P
<Vivix> anyway yeah, games like GTA and Mafia 2 on console is nice- but give me fps, and I will rotate in a corner while trying to walk for like 15 minutes
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<Jmo> Hey DerpDash
<Ninjazz> Hello, DerpDash.
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, yeah, and then I've tried PS Move... I tried to hang myself after that...
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo DerpDash
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpDash
<Meanwhile> See if that's the case Planetside really sounds like a game that could play well with some form of Commander system.
<JunkerKun> DerpDash, hello!
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, perhaps it was best not playing a FPS on the PSMove. ^_^;
<DerpDash> whos streaming?
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo "I'm still going to lick you" :P
<Ninjazz> Wrek.
<Ninjazz> DAT QUICK FINISH.
<Vivix> you can connect mouse and keyboard to ps3 for typing and surfin, but can you use it in games?
<DerpDash> ah ok
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, yeah, I know. But hey, it worked fine in Resistance 3
<Jmo> You're an arsehat AdamTheDuck.
<AdamTheDuck> I love you too Jmo
<Gold_Demona> So much love in this chat today. :D
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, Mmmm. People have told me that they prefer the Move controls over the gamesticks though.
<AdamTheDuck> $40 :<
<Ninjazz> Awwww, yeah. Planetside time.
<Ninjazz> Damn...
<AdamTheDuck> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Jmo> $40 for what AdamTheDuck?
<Meanwhile> Thing is, the average schmuck isn't likely to listen to a commander.
<JunkerKun> Ninjazz, I don't know. It depends on your position and your screen to much
<AdamTheDuck> Oh cool
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, Planetside Alpha squad premium or something
<Jmo> Ah
<Gold_Demona> Do shit? There's a place for that. :P
<Ninjazz> JunkerKun, that's why I just stick to the gamesticks instead of movement gaming.
<Wrek> 05Meanwhile: so far in beta
<Wrek> 05they far in beta they did listen
<JunkerKun> Anyone gonna buy the Guild Wars 2?
<Wrek> 05each squad has a squad leader
<Wrek> 05most often the dropship pilot
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, already go it :P
<Meanwhile> My main is already max level in Guild Wars 2.
<Ninjazz> OH! So it's like Battlefield 2 instead of BF3.
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, =8O
<Wrek> 05as i understand GW2 istn about leveling
<AdamTheDuck> Nope :< haven't played much due to school
<Meanwhile> It's not. It's very swift levelling. Thing is I personally have yet to find out what it actually /is/ about -_^
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, I'm still waiting for sells to start in Russia. They should adapt price and we should get it a little cheapier
<Vivix> I think I heard people say GW2 is about PVP with unrelated story snippets pasted in-
<Gold_Demona> SC2! Yay~
<Meanwhile> Wrek: But what I mean is faction Command. You know, someone to co-ordinate squad movements on the bigger scale.
<Vivix> at least that's what the description sounded like
<AdamTheDuck> Is it strange that I actually play GW2 for the story? o.o
<Vivix> Maaaybe AdamTheDuck
<Jmo> You're strange already, what's the point AdamTheDuck
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, why not? I've played first one for the story too
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> I only heard the description, the stories sounded like I wanted to hear more, but that you weren't told more
<AdamTheDuck> We meet again my doppelganger, AdamTh3Walker. :|
<Meanwhile> I have yet to actually try GW2 PvP.
<JunkerKun> But hey, I've played with friends =D
<AdamTh3Walker> O hai :3
<Vivix> I don't play MMOs, so I only know it by proxy
*Gold_Demona sings along with Wrek
<AdamTh3Walker> AdamTheDuck, how are things?
<Vivix> I am tempted to rename myself AdamTheDeer or something-
<AdamTheDuck> Everything is awesome AdamTh3Walker, just played Guns of Icarus for the first time as captain and damn that was hectic. :D
<AdamTh3Walker> Oh man
<AdamTheDuck> I'm such in a cheery mood :3
<AdamTh3Walker> I still haven't played that, actually
<Meanwhile> Guns of Icarus is quite fun.
<AdamTh3Walker> It sounds so fun
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, daaw... I wanted to play too, but thee were no players =(
<AdamTheDuck> But yeah, moral of the story, never let a player called AdamTheDuck play as captain in that game. Ever.
<JunkerKun> Vivix, why deer? O_o
<Vivix> Terrible disaster?
<Vivix> I just like Deer-
<Vivix> so cute
<AdamTh3Walker> lol
<Vivix> but you know, barage of Adams
<AdamTh3Walker> :3
*AdamTh3Walker opens Steam and looks it up
<doughnutjoe> HELLO!
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, you've killed the whole team?
<AdamTheDuck> I like ducks because there was this duck in an Antarctica documentary that ate scavenged seal meat
<doughnutjoe> I AM BACK
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> Ducks snapped after my finger once
<Vivix> suddenly kinda scary
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, D=? Duck ate seal meat? O_O
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, crashed my ship into the enemy but the team understood I was new :P
*Vivix snickers
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah it was strange :D
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, lol. When are they going to release the game and end this beta anyway?
<doughnutjoe> So who is streaming?
<AdamTheDuck> Wasn't much else to eat so it started eating seal
<Vivix> Our little Wrekkie
<JunkerKun> doughnutjoe, Wrek
<AdamTheDuck> doughnutjoe, Wrek is
<doughnutjoe> k thanks
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, Game releases in 2 weeks at the start of October
<doughnutjoe> this is starcraft right?
<Vivix> yeah
<AdamTheDuck> I assume beta will end just before game is released
<AdamTheDuck> not so sure on exact closing date for beta.
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck, oh, cool. I guess I'll be able to finally play then =)
<AdamTheDuck> brb~
<Vivix> 2 days 3 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds
<doughnutjoe> and stream won't load -_-
<AdamTh3Walker> brb
<doughnutjoe> how do we join diffrent rooms again?
<Vivix> we can only do that on moview night and episode showings
<doughnutjoe> nvm
<Vivix> or well- if you don't mean the siderooms its /join whateverchannel
<Sonny> Heya everypony

*AdamTheDuck stares at you with a twisted head as a deformed smile becomes apparent
<Sonny> AdamTheDuck: O_O
<AdamTh3Walker> I'm really liking the sound of that
<Sonny> anyway back to drawing
<AdamTh3Walker> Not the creepy smile
<AdamTheDuck> lol ^
<AdamTh3Walker> The drawing :P
<Ninjazz> When you start saying "you" instead of the name of the person, that's probably the border line.
<Ninjazz> Also, Sonny, that sounds lovely.
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Ninjazz> Hey, FillyFlam.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo FillyFlam
<Sonny> Ye I'm trying to make it awesome so ye :D

<AdamTheDuck> Haha you thought we were joking Sonny ? :P
<Sonny> xD
<Sonny> ye lol :p
<Sonny> anyhow got a drawing to draw
<Sonny> call me when you need me ^^
<Gold_Demona> To be perfectly honest, the llamas don't really serve any purpose other than to look pretty on your profile and show how many people gave you llamas. :P
<Sonny> lol ok xp
<Gold_Demona> But I think they're a lot of fun, so I give everybody llamas whenever I can. :D
<Gold_Demona> Whether they want one of not. :P

<Meanwhile> That feel when you solo a group event on GW2.
*Ponies47 Exits the chat room and flips a table on the way out
<AdamTheDuck> Dat forever alone feel when you solo a group even in GW2.
<Jmo> Pucker up princess.
<Meanwhile> Ikr. Still early, not many people about.
<Meanwhile> Still, I take some pride in beating 10 opponents by myself.
<Ninjazz> You people and your GW2s.

<Jmo> Damn youtube. ;~;
<Ninjazz> Ah, YouTube, world's second most prolific distraction.
<Ninjazz> Next to Bronystate of course.
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz, That and Tumblr. :P
<Gold_Demona> And DeviantArt
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, especially those.
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: all those indeed. I waste so much time :D
<Gold_Demona> Me too... It's a wonder I get anything done around here. =/
<Sylandest> ^
<Gold_Demona> Sounds like the makings of a good day, Wrek. =)
<Gold_Demona> Tea... Earl Gray... Hot
<Sylandest> I could go for some sweet tea, myself...but too early, truly
<Gold_Demona> I'm drinking coffee myself.
<Ninjazz> Coffee... hot... geewwd.
<Gold_Demona> Yersh
*Sylandest does not drink coffee
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, delightful!
<Sylandest> im singled out! >.<
<Gold_Demona> Coffee's not for everyone, and neither is tea. It's all a matter of taste, and we do not judge here. :3
<Sylandest> yay~
*Sylandest hugs Gold_Demona
<Ninjazz> This is where I come in and say "Why not both?"
<AdamTheDuck> ^ :P
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: Por que no los dos? :D
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, nein!
<Gold_Demona> D:
<Ninjazz> Mios dio!
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ah, esta chica quiere hablar espanol!
<Ninjazz> But yeah, Gold_Demona, Si, que no los dos? :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I was quoting a taco bell commercial actually, but lol XD
<Sylandest> :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: how come you learned spanish?
<Gold_Demona> "?Por que no los dos?"
<AdamTheDuck> Donde, esta, la biblioteca
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Because my mommy and my daddy are both from Colombia and spoke mostly Spanish to me. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Me llamo T bone la arana discoteca!
<MadSurge> Je suis une bibliotheque! :D
<Gold_Demona> So my native tongue is Spanglish
<Ninjazz> I hate libraries.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: oh, sweet!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge is a French library. Gotcha
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh what was the rest of the song?...
<Ninjazz> I hate the water.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my dad spoke a lot of english... and all videogames were in english :D
<Gold_Demona> My parents spoke mostly Spanish to me, and the TV and video games spoke English to me, so yeah. Spanglish. :P
<Twiglet_Spackle> You know what I don't hate... I don`t hate vests
<Gold_Demona> Vasts are cool
<Ninjazz> I hate Steam.
<Gold_Demona> vests*
<Gold_Demona> Why do you hate Steam?
<Ninjazz> I mean I love! I love Steam!
<Gold_Demona> Ok then, lol
<AdamTheDuck> Mondays :| I loathe thee to kingdom come
<Ninjazz> L4D ref.
<Sylandest> :D
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: You and Garfield have something in common. :P
<AdamTheDuck> So is the primary goal just to survive waves upon waves of zerg?
<Sylandest> i think so, AdamTh3Walker
<Sylandest> * AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Sylandest> shush, im still waking up :P
*Gold_Demona dunks Sylandest into a vat of caffeine
<Gold_Demona> Awake yet?
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: what-no-mggrgrgrgrgrle! *tries to speak in vat of caffeine*
<Gold_Demona> lol :D
<AdamTheDuck> I wonder what pure caffeine looks and tastes like
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: id imagine not very pleasant :$
<Gold_Demona> It's probably one of those colorless flavorless critters
<Gold_Demona> A chemical they just add to things.
<Sylandest> still, a whole vat of the stuff?
<Sylandest> not very pleasant
<Gold_Demona> lol, I imagine not. XD
<Sylandest> dunno if you'd get any energy intake from it though...
<Gold_Demona> Your heart would probably explode before the energy effect kicks in. XD
<Gold_Demona> Having THAT much caffeine in your system
<Sylandest> or it would morph you into some sort of energy fiend
<Sylandest> depends on your caffeine immunity
<Gold_Demona> Caffeineman!
<AdamTheDuck> "Like an adrenaline shot straight to the heart"~
<Dark_Horst> that would kill you
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: boosting people's mornings, one cup at a time? :D
<AdamTheDuck> Cheshire Cat, American McGee's Alice.
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: Yes!
<AdamTheDuck> Boooom explosions yay
<Sylandest> loving this music...its perfect for this quiet morning in my dorm lobby

<prince-dari> I swear 50 years ago a man would get laughed at for being scared of spiders
<Ninjazz> Say that while the fucker is crawling up your leg.
<Sonny> yup
<Sonny> I eat them
<Sonny> they're tasty
<Hisao> I don't like spiders.
<Hisao> I don't freak out, but I stay well away.
<Gold_Demona> Same here Hisao
<Ninjazz> Anything with legs longer than its body freaks me out.
<Barbetos|AtWork> And just 10 to 20 years ago you would get ostracized for liking MLP and being a man.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Funny how the world works.
<Sonny> Did you know that in an avarage human life the person is about 1m away from a spider his/her intire life?
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: If ANYTHING is crawling up my leg, I freak out. Unless I know immediately it's not something that'll bite me.
<Sonny> just a fun fact that I know from Vsauce ^^
<prince-dari> hey jaymoo
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: they actually say that phobias lke arachno- are developed from older times from a fear of dangerous animals into a reflexive fear

<Ninjazz> I know I would.
<Ninjazz> Even if it would just be me. ;_;
<prince-dari> Waddafuck
<prince-dari> I don't even want to consider how much money he spent on lasers
<Jmo> LOl
<Gold_Demona> It's a laser spirograph! o_o
<Ninjazz> ...How is that even possible?...
<Mishia> Heyo
<prince-dari> With crazy laser shit anything is possible
<Mishia> Good ol bronystate
<Ninjazz> 'ello der, Mishia.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Mishia
<Ninjazz> And that's the projector.
<Ninjazz> He could double rainbows anytime he want to.
<Ninjazz> Hell, quad rainbows.
<Sonny> RDWH
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: MFW quadruple rainbows
<Sonny> Rainbow Dash was here :p
<prince-dari> Laser + smoke
<Dermathil> morning, who's streaming?
<prince-dari> = Holy shit
<twilight_sprinkle> daaaamn
<twilight_sprinkle> dem lazars
<Ninjazz> Sheeet.
<Dermathil> who is streamiNG?
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Dermathil and wrek is
<Ninjazz> Wrek.
<Ninjazz> Also, hai, Dermathil.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: have you seen rarilicious?
<Dermathil> WREK, what faction do you hail to in Planetside?
<prince-dari> Did you guys know that 'laser' is actually an acronym? I only found that out the other day
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, IT'S OOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUT?!
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: yeah, i knew that since high school
<Dermathil> yes I knew that, dari. Forgot for what though.
<Ninjazz> I didn't.
<twilight_sprinkle> light amplified
<Jmo> must b dabi
<twilight_sprinkle> i forgot the rest..
<Ninjazz> I just thought it was just amplified light.
<prince-dari> Wikipedia is my friend
<prince-dari> Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Ninjazz> Cheater.
<JRP|laptop> 22nd
<Dermathil> anyways, hey Dari
<prince-dari> Hey
<Dermathil> how are you man?
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: ah, but do you know how it Works?
<prince-dari> Pretty good thanks, you Derm?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: its not called rarilicious tho
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah
<Jmo> With wikipedia, dabi can know how anything works.
<Gold_Demona> Hey, chat's coming to life now. =D
<prince-dari> A mirror that photons can partially pass through
<Dermathil> was my 18th birthday on the 10th
<prince-dari> And a mirror that full reflects them
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, was it that special message she sent?
<Ninjazz> Oh, happy belated b-day, Dermathil.
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well thats not all, they also have to be the same phase
<Dermathil> thx
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: so the light passing by actually induces more light in the material of the same phase iirc
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: yeh
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, had that on repeat for hours.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: done by none other than Tabitha it would seem
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: lol
<Dermathil> I gots my planetside key from the IGN thingy. So happy (still hate IGN)
<Ninjazz> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Is this a star craft2 mod or something?
<Ninjazz> I thought it was the animator's sister...
<Ninjazz> Freakin' Tabitha herself...
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: well he didnt say for sure, but there are strong hints that she did. plus ive yet to hear a fan VA with her voice
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, that's why i was so impressed.
<Ninjazz> It would make sense if Tabitha made it herself.
<Ninjazz> But if someone else could actually get the voice down, so much demand for that one person.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: ikr
<prince-dari> Dayum that's cool
<Ninjazz> So shiny.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, this I will watch closely.
<Mishia> Twili
<Mishia> :)
<Mishia> so who is streaming?
<Ninjazz> Just imagine those lights on a wall 100ft. tall.
<Ninjazz> So.... awesome.
<Ninjazz> Wrek, btw.
<Dermathil> Dari, It seems that Richard III's body has been found
<Mishia> Cool
<prince-dari> Wut
<Sonny> Ihave to do the dishes
<Sonny> be back later
<Sonny> <3
<Mishia> I thought it was SuperBrony64..... but he is sleeping o~o
<Barbetos|AtWork> He is just that good.
<Dermathil> He was the last english king to die in battle, dari.
<Sylandest> Dermathil: they found his body?
<prince-dari> But how did they know where to look?
<prince-dari> Surely the battle field is pretty large
<Mishia> They might have not
<Dermathil> well, they have strong evidence that they found it.
<Mishia> Known
<Meanwhile> Was he the one who's meant to be buried in a pub car park?
<Sylandest> Dermathil: link? or is this on news?
<Mishia> They found it by accdient/ found in the search
<Dermathil> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9537600/Strong-evidence-Richard-IIIs-body-has-been-found-with-a-curved-spine.html
<Dermathil> he was a hunchback!
<Ninjazz> Wait wait wait.
<Mishia> XD
<Ninjazz> Richard the 3rd?
<Mishia> yus
<Ninjazz> Didn't he drown in a river?
<Mishia> ....?
<Sylandest> nope, Ninjazz
<Mishia> o~o hey i woudn't know. Ima just a freshman learning about WW2 in History
<prince-dari> Do they tell you that America won WWII single handedly? That's what Americans on youtube always seem to think. :P
<Ninjazz> Pretty much.
<Dermathil> ...lol Tom Hanks made the memorial service for Michael Clarke Duncan laugh quite a bit.
<Ninjazz> Cause, you know Dari, MURIKA.
<Eli> Dermathil: i'm actually more surprised about the 2 knights at the ruins...
<Kinixys> After listening to her interview by FinalDraft, it sounds _like_ something she'd say.
<Eli> prince-dari: that's kinda funny... do they know that the URSS did more than america? they actually arrived in berlin way before america...
<Mishia> prince-dari: If i rember right, We were told that americans were pretty much out of this war untill later and countributed very little. It was mostly the Triple ente' of Britian, Russia, and France agianst the triple alliance of Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary
<Mishia> Oh wait
<Mishia> Lol you ment 2
<Mishia> NVM XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> prince-dari: Pft. America got EXTREMELY lucky to be honest. A few more years of waiting and we would of been fucked.
<Mishia> Yes, they did say that America did pretty fucking good.
<prince-dari> Well to be fair, they obviously did help
<prince-dari> But as has been said the USSR was the major player pretty much
<Gold_Demona> "Bloody Americans, always showing up late for every war..."
<Mishia> Wait
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not anymore. Now we actively seek them out and look like assholes while we do it.
<Ninjazz> I just like to imagine we just came in after everyone was tired of fighting.
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Ninjazz> Made things easier.
<Eli> Mishia: you can't say that. if america hadn't joined we would have likely lost the war
*Sylandest blinks as the chat has changed from Rarilicious's voice actor to Richard III to WW2
<Mishia> how Many americans are in here, since most would be adults/ in a farther state then me since its a school day
<Sylandest> I am confuzzled...
<Gold_Demona> I R Murican
<Ninjazz> I think we just wanted to get to Japan.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sylandest it will be okay.
<Ninjazz> But had to get rid of the European theatre first.
<prince-dari> I think the USSR would have held the line to be honest, but it would have been a lot worse if America hadn't joined the war.
<Mishia> Eli: for WW1 they told us very little help was from america. for ww2, America apperently did pretty fucking well
<Sylandest> Barbetos|AtWork: but I iz scared! >.<
<Ninjazz> Definately.
<Gold_Demona> That's how I understood it. We joined in cuz Japan bombed our shtuff and we said "Oh no you Di'n't!"
<Mishia> true.
<Mishia> XD
<Ninjazz> I mean, USSR was pretty much bound to win after Stalingrad failed.
<Eli> Ninjazz: uhh... i don't like what america did in Japan at all...
<prince-dari> MFW the tsunami and earthquake in Japand and Americans commented saying "that's for pearl harbour"
<Mishia> ......
<prince-dari> >_>
<Ninjazz> ...
<Mishia> LOL
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that's in poor taste
<Ninjazz> Not cool.
<Ninjazz> Eli, well, it was that or wipe out all of Japan. They were ready to fight to the bitter end.
<Gold_Demona> They already MORE than paid for Pearl Harbor with the 2 A-bombs we dropped on them.
<Eli> prince-dari: as if... after that bomb the US didn't have any grudge to hold. what they did was worse
<Ninjazz> But, I have to say that if we could have forseen the future, I don't think we would have dropped the bombs.
<Meanwhile> I'm sure there's probably a comment on a 9/11 video somewhere "That's just for being cunts"
<Eli> Ninjazz: nope. Japan had already accepted all of the terms. They threw the bombs to prove a point
<prince-dari> Fair enough Meanwhile
<prince-dari> You're probably right
<Mishia> Not cool. din't they do somthing so terrible as to Japan 2 Atomic Bombs? and then they still hold a gruge about it :<
<Ninjazz> Eli, and you found this where?
<Meanwhile> To be honest though, America is probably the least tolerant country in the western world.
<Mishia> XD
<Gold_Demona> I have to agree, Meanwhile. And I live here
<Eli> Ninjazz: in a long intresting talk with a critical history teacher.
<Mishia> I am america, and if you kick a dog, i will kill you.
<Ninjazz> I live on a territory and I agree.
<prince-dari> I don't really understand America's response to Pearl Harbour
<prince-dari> About 2200 people died in that attack
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile I blame the <insert racial slur here>
<Meanwhile> Probably on account of that by global standards, America is 12 years old.
<Mishia> ._.
<prince-dari> And up to 200,000 people died in Japan after they dropped the atomic bombs.
<Gold_Demona> That sounds about right. America's a relatively young country
<prince-dari> The response doesn't really seem proportional
<KnifeH> It's done. Yay~ http://knifeh.deviantart.com/art/Scootaloo-326771443
<Dark_Horst> i like how the internet was full of "THAT'S FOR PEARL HARBOR, JAPANSE FUCKTARDS!" after the tsunami and fukushima
<Jmo> Great job KnifeH
<Dragonmatte> prince-dari: America: But... but they started it >:(
<Ninjazz> It doesn't matter the cost, it's the fact that they attacked, Dari.
<KnifeH> Jmo: X3
<Dark_Horst> appearantly, all of those seemed to conveniently forget that japan was nukes in response to pearl harbor
<Gold_Demona> People do things in war that don't make any sense.
<Kammerjunk> Think that's weird? Some people are saying the whole tsunami thing in Japan was "God/Nature's payback for Pearl Harbour."
<Dark_Horst> *nuked
<Kammerjunk> Which is just silly.
<Mishia> That and they destroyed CIVILIAN HOMES AND CITIES. they dropped their bombs on a harbor, killing less people. they bombed a city. DAFUCK AMERICA?
<Sylandest> KnifeH: most impressive. well done!
<Eli> Ninjazz: i don't say the US is bad for something they did almost 70 years ago, but it's fact that Japan was ready to accept the terms and give up. But since the USSR was really close to taking over all of Japan, the bombs were thrown anyways, to "claim" Japan by the US
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, and in very poor taste.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Quite.
<Gold_Demona> People are just stupid is all. >=/
<Sylandest> ^
<Mishia> Kammerjunk: din't they get their just desserts from an already cruel dropping of atomic bombs?
<Ninjazz> Eli, ... I find that hard to believe but I can see why it'd be done.
<Wrek> 05that went ratehr well
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: what'S that mod called?
<Wrek> 05i had my defended little city
<Wrek> 05its called epire builder
<Kammerjunk> Mishia: Even if the bombs hadn't be dropped, it would still be a stupid thing to say.
<Gold_Demona> lol, that conversational deja vu
<Ninjazz> :O
<prince-dari> [15:27] <Gold_Demona> People do things in war that don't make any sense. | Yeah, I guess you're right
<Mishia> I dont hate japan. They are awesome, and i still feel sad for them.
<Dark_Horst> i might reinstall starcraft for that
<Eli> Ninjazz: it was political, sadly. but yeah, warcrimes. no one ever does anything about it.
<Wrek> 05lets check if the servers are up yet
<Mishia> Kammerjunk: it is. you could have said somthing more comferting
<Ninjazz> Eli, damn right.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Planet Side 2 withdrawal?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Update?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Again?
<Gold_Demona> Mmmm, tea
<Mishia> Wrek can i have some tea
<Mishia> Pweeeeeeeee
<Mishia> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Eli> "History is written by the victors" -Churchill
<Mishia> seeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek have you been using your Cert points?
<Mishia> Eli: Victors Justice?
<Mishia> Wrek: Nice Streaming :)
<Ninjazz> Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.
<Barbetos|AtWork> forever a 30%
<Mishia> Lol
<Ninjazz> Nooooooooooooooooooooooo.
<Barbetos|AtWork> and then it got 100% cooler???
<Barbetos|AtWork> =P
<Mishia> Hopefully it does Wrek
<Mishia> Hopefully it does....
*Gold_Demona yawns because of Wrek's yawn
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh my
<prince-dari> >British man wins tennis open in 1912
<Barbetos|AtWork> blue dead guy in spawn is never a good sign.
<prince-dari> >World War I 2 years later
<Eli> Mishia: something like that yeah... Sad fact: It's a good thing the US showed the power of the bomb. because of that, they had a certain power and could "take over" europe and make it a capitalism economy. i would hate to live in a communist society, so every bad thing can end well too
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol!
<Dark_Horst> well, at least we didnt start that one
<Barbetos|AtWork> owned
<Ninjazz> Looks great.
<prince-dari> >British man wins tennis open in 1936
<prince-dari> >World War II 3 years later
<prince-dari> >Andy Murray wins tennis open 2012
<Mishia> prince-dari: lol
<Eli> prince-dari: :O
<Sylandest> whoops
<Barbetos|AtWork> ...
<Dark_Horst> ...partytime!
<prince-dari> >World War III starts 4 years later in 2016?
<Ninjazz> ...so it's God's punishmeant to the world for Britain winning.
<Ninjazz> Seems legit.
<Mishia> I forgot to hug Baretos and wrek
<Dark_Horst> i'd say we let russia go first this time
*Mishia Hugs Baretos, then Wrek
<Barbetos|AtWork> prince-dari: Guess we should enlist now?
<Dark_Horst> or china
<Ninjazz> Actually, that doesn't seem like a improbability.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I like random hugs :3
<Gold_Demona> And then Zephram Cochrane meets some Vulcans and human space travel is born
<Barbetos|AtWork> What was that for? =P
<Ninjazz> I mean, the world is pretty volitile as it is.
<Eli> prince-dari: does britain really win that little in the tennis open?
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: aint that the truth?
<prince-dari> Well, we have won in other years as well
<prince-dari> But Andy Murray is our first tennis open win since 1936 I think
<prince-dari> In years before 1936 we won quite a lot
<Mishia> Barbetos|AtWork: For the good work done in TF2 mvm Bronystate
<Mishia> Wrek.... well just because i felt like it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. Well I will take what I can get. =P
<Ninjazz> Remember headshots, Wrek.
<Ninjazz> So the patturn doesn't exactly work, Dari.
<Mishia> MEOW
<Mishia> Nuff said
<Barbetos|AtWork> So I heard a new tatic for this game yesterday. Strap C4's to a max suit and have them run in, then you explode them.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Fun fun.
<Ninjazz> Barbetos|AtWork, more suicide tactices. Great.
<Ninjazz> Tactics*
<Barbetos|AtWork> Worth it?
<Ninjazz> Of course.
<Ninjazz> Having a moving C4 carrier is deadly.
<Mishia> Barbetos|AtWork: Howabout you stick them to your allies and order them to run into them
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would love to see a Rick Jame Max Suit Experience do that.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Ninjazz> Rick James, bitch.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Mishia Well that is technically what is happening, the Max Suits can take a lot of fire before dieing so they are more likely to reach their target.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yesterday I was trying to strap C4 to a magrider that was not paying attention to me as a combat medic, but one of his buddies spotted me =(
<Ninjazz> Medics can carry c4?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. so that is where the implants are.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ninjazz All the classes can except Max and Cloaker
<Ninjazz> Ah. Awesome!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Cloakers get claymores instead.
<Barbetos|AtWork> MEdics get a revive grenade. I was having fun with that.
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: :D LIVE! DIE! LIVE
<MadSurge> *!
<Ninjazz> Revive grenade?
<Ninjazz> A grenade that heals?
<Ninjazz> What madness is this?
<Mishia> Yes
<Mishia> Tf2 medic feels jelous *lowers Medigun/Ubersaw*
<MadSurge> Hey, in Borderlands with the right perks you can heal people by shooting at them
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol I like the healing shot guns in that game
<Barbetos|AtWork> I found it absurd
<Barbetos|AtWork> the very idea of buck shot healing.
<Dark_Horst> pills via shotgun
<Dark_Horst> vaccine by knife
<Dark_Horst> sounds fun
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: I got my fav gun from a special mook in a DLC, a machinegun that shot incredibly fast with infinite bullets :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> The new prowler is useless. It has two shells that do half damage each. The other team gets full damage per shot.
<Sundaysmile> What game is this?
<Gold_Demona> Bless you, Wrek
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrekichu!
<Barbetos|AtWork> instant action?

<MadSurge> Serenity: yum :)
<Serenity> I'm sure he's not 5 years old, no need for sweet dreams ^^
<Kammerjunk> But he is!
<Kammerjunk> Innit right, Ninjazz?
<Kammerjunk> Welp, he's not here to say it's wrong, so it's right.
<Serenity> ...

<Ninjazz> <_<
<pony_337616> Phew
<Kammerjunk> Phew?
<Serenity> Phew.
<Kammerjunk> Phew indeed.
<Ninjazz> No. Wait. Kammerjunk is wrong. Last time I checked I'm 18! >:C
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha. No.
<Ninjazz> I just happen act like a 5 year old.
<JunkerKun> Phew. I made it. Theory is done. Now driving exam and I'll have my driving license
<Ninjazz> A 5 year old with better grammar than most it appears.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, but you also have better grammar than most 18 year old people.
<Serenity> ^
<Serenity> So cold over here
*Ninjazz is more sad about that than happy.
<Serenity> Wish El shitbox would catch fire so I can use it for warmth
<Kammerjunk> It's either too hot, too cold, too dry or too wet here.
<JunkerKun> Serenity, El...what?
<Serenity> Aha, you must be new here?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: you also behave better than other people allegedly older than you :D
<JunkerKun> Well, I'm not a often guest here that's for sure
<Serenity> El Shitbox = my computer
<Kammerjunk> I've been here a while, I still don't know.
<JunkerKun> Oh.
<MadSurge> Serenity: :D nice nickname
*Ninjazz is even more sad about that.
<Kammerjunk> Sad Ninjazz is sad.
<Serenity> MadSurge: You know who I am, yeh?
<Ninjazz> :C
<MadSurge> Serenity: who should you be? :D
<Ninjazz> Also, been here since Late Feb. By most standards, I'm still a newbie.
<JunkerKun> Serenity, Um... Moon princess? =D
<Serenity> Well, I was formerly known as Fazana, then I changed to Very_Silly_Filly
<MadSurge> Serenity: OOOH
<Kammerjunk> Oh. It's you.
<Dark92Enigma> Ninjazz same here.......
<Serenity> I've been here since July Last year
<Kammerjunk> I've been here since hell-do-I-know last year.
<MadSurge> Serenity: whassup my man? How's your hand?
<Dark92Enigma> Y I HAVEN'T GOT HERE SOONER
<Kammerjunk> Sometime in the summer.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, around the summer-y part.
<Serenity> MadSurge: I can handwrite, that's a good sign, even if it looks like a 5 year old handwriting
<MadSurge> Serenity: better than no handwriting.
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: A few weeks after I joined I beleive
<JunkerKun> Serenity, Huh? What happened?
<WallDives> Ninjazz, I thought you were leaving?
<Serenity> I crushed my wrist 5 years ago, and had some parts inside amputated
<JunkerKun> Serenity, oh. Sorry
<Serenity> I'm over it
<Ninjazz> Trying to do one more thing beforehand, WD.
<JunkerKun> Good thing my accident ended with a good result
<Serenity> But because they aren't connected to the tendons, that makes my wrist fall out of place and hurt a lot
<JunkerKun> Serenity, you aren't using painkillers?
<Serenity> JunkerKun: I'm used to the pain.
<JunkerKun> Serenity, Damn, that should be hard. I can't even imagine what you've been through
<Serenity> JunkerKun: Now, I think of it as a mere inconvenience, since my handiwork is terrible because
<JunkerKun> Serenity, well, let us not talk about bad things. Reminding people of bad things is not my favorite part
<Sonny> Dinner was dillisious

<SafariMonkey> alexxm: What subjects are you studying?
<Gold_Demona> lol, yes Unnr. "helping"
<alexxm> media SafariMonkey
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo kirzstryfe
<Unnr> Gold_Demona: My cat is an expert in helping with homework
<kirzstryfe> this one of the Earth games?
<Gold_Demona> Unnr: My cats love to help me with laundry and sweeping the kitchen
*kirzstryfe pokes Wrek and asks "watcha playin"
<alexxm> how are things kirstryfe
<Gold_Demona> Unnr: Cats are so helpful, aren't they? :D
<Unnr> Gold_Demona: Of course, they are experts at getting all the sleep you miss!~
<Gold_Demona> Unnr: LOL, Ain't it the truth! XD
<RaveBrony> What game is this? O.o
<kirzstryfe> not sure
<kirzstryfe> base looked like it was from the Earth xxxx series of games, but I don't think there was an fps version
<RaveBrony> I dont know what those are either D:
<kirzstryfe> anyone happen to know which game Wrek is playing atm?
<RaveBrony> This game looks So hardcore tho!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sup
<kirzstryfe> planetside or tribes maybe
<Gold_Demona> kirzstryfe: PlanetSide 2 I do believe
<RaveBrony> Ill look it up :P
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo SpadeMagnes[School]
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey guys :)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I still prefer cats over dogs :3
<MaxTheBrony> heyo, and bye .
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: To be honest, I love both equally, but as far as owning the animal, I prefer to have cats. Because cats don't require leaving the house. XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Been busy playing alot of Xenosaga lately
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: indeed :D also they're not emotional wrecks like dogs if you leave them on their own :D
<Gold_Demona> That too. I believe that our cats do miss us when we leave, but they're not traumatized by our absence. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Cats can be evil and annoying sometimes
<Gold_Demona> Cuz my cats to come to see us when we come home.
<Unnr> Of course, when you leave the mobile food deployment platform is gone and they are sad. Then they take a nap.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: mine too :$
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School] So can dogs :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is there still audio? I cant hear anything even with my headphones on
<Unnr> dogs just tend to have fewer creative ways to be annoying and evil
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: cats are just different from dogs, they can ignore their masters if they choose to :D
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: yes, just really low audio
<Unnr> That being said, studies have show that cats actually care more about the approval of their human than dogs
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I miss my cat :(
<Unnr> which is why cats are an absolute nightmare to work with as a psychological model in a lab.
<Gold_Demona> I remember when we took our cats to get them fixed. That night after we brought them back home, the one cat cried and cried outside our bedroom door until we finally opened the door and her her sleep on the bed with us.
<Gold_Demona> let her*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: cats love to sleep with their humans, don't they? :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> These new headphones I got make it hard to hear anything outside of whats on my computer
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ours do at any rate.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So I have to take them off to try ot hear anyone talking near me
<Gold_Demona> Mine usually like to hang out in the same room as me.
<Unnr> MadSurge: then you find them licking your armpit for attention at 5am
<MaxTheBrony> be back later :)
<Gold_Demona> Unnr: Mine have never done that lol. XD
<Gold_Demona> I've had them sniff and purr in my face before, but never lick my armpit.
<MadSurge> Unnr: yeah :D mine does it only with my parents sometimes
<Unnr> Gold_Demona: It is the most awkward feeling ever, particularly if your pits are freshly shaved
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Jmo> ._.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My cat died at like 13 or so... he was old
<Gold_Demona> Our cats are like 3 or 4. Something like that
<Gold_Demona> I'd have to check the vet papers to know for sure, and I don't feel like digging them out. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who the hell is flying that thing?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *cough*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyone there?
<Gold_Demona> Nope, we all died
<Jmo> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Seems legit
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my cat and the one before her loved the smell of my used shoes .__.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Mine go nuts over my husband's work shoes when he comes home from work.
<MadSurge> Kitties are weird sometimes :D
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<EspyLacopa|2> Get your flying saucer and start doing strafing runs!
<Maid_RainBow1> MadSurge : indeed
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MAYDAY
<MadSurge> My cat instead of drinking water from a bowl drinks the bidet water, and if unavailable, she drinks from the toilet :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Bidet?
<Gold_Demona> My one cat likes to dip his paw in the water and like the water off his paw.
<PillowPhone> Hi guys
<Jmo> Haaai PillowPhone
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello PillowPhone :)
*PillowPhone hugs Jmo, MLP_Brovakiin and the rest of the chat
<alexxm> how are things PillowPhone
<PillowPhone> Alexxm: I'm fine, just at home with my niece and doing some word searches
<PillowPhone> I'm more than halfway done with the book I'm working on
<alexxm> whats your book about PillowPhone
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Riding that Not-Mongoose like a pro
<PillowPoni|Phone> Alexxm: its the word search book I'm doing.
<PillowPoni|Phone> I'm on puzzle 48
<alexxm> ah ok PillowPonie|Phone good luck
<PillowPoni|Phone> I got 33 puzzles left
<PillowPoni|Phone> And then I start on the new puzzle book I bought the other day
<Gold_Demona> How difficult are the puzzles?
<Saturn> 08,01woah
<Saturn> 08,01ipv6
<Saturn> 08,01awesome
<PillowPoni|Phone> Gold_Demona: pretty easy.
<Gold_Demona> heh
<PillowPoni|Phone> Word searches are my favorite. I could do them literally all day
<Jmo> o.o
<Gold_Demona> Yeah crosswords are fun. =)
<Gold_Demona> I also really like Sudoku puzzles.
<PillowPoni|Phone> I love crosswords but I can't do the ones that give you the hints to the answers
<Eli> I'm watching Rhett&Links Bronies: The Controversy on youtube, and i noticed, when Rhett says "I'm not really into it." he shows multiple signs of someone lying... strange :)
<PillowPoni|Phone> I can't seem to solve them. But if its the regular ones where you just put inletters, I'm pretty quick
<Gold_Demona> PillowPoni|Phone: There are crosswords that don't give you hints? O_o
<PillowPoni|Phone> Gold_Demona: yep. They're the same as the ones in the newspapers but they just have a list of words that you have to figure out which box it goes into
<PillowPoni|Phone> Instead of the hints
<Gold_Demona> Ooooh, I see
<PillowPoni|Phone> Yep. I have about 3 books of them and they're full
<Maid_RainBow> well everypony i will be going now but be back later
<PillowPoni|Phone> Bye...and she's gone
<Gold_Demona> See, the ones with the hints are "regular" for me. This is the first I've ever heard of the hintless kind. :P
<Gold_Demona> Later Wrek
<Gold_Demona> Thanks for stream
<Jmo> Thanks Wrek
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Madman Pony Poster Competition
<PillowPoni|Phone> Thanks for the stream, Wrek (even though I couldn't watch it)
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Wrek
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HACADr823oU
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you start out with a few letters to give you a starting point
<Gold_Demona> Sounds too easy, but then again I can never finish a regular crossword without cheating. :P
<SafariMonkey> Hello SirGanjalf
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I saw some wher you have to even guess where the BLACK SQUARES go
<SirGanjalf> hello
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: THAT is fascinating
<alexxm> how are things SirGanjalf
<Gold_Demona> Ther sounds incredibly hard. o_o
<Gold_Demona> That*
<MadSurge> Try insane hard :D
<SafariMonkey> alexxm: took the words right out of my chat-box
*PillowPoni|Phone dislikes audoku
<Jmo> Dat audoku :>
<PillowPoni|Phone> Sudoku*
<PillowPoni|Phone> Lol Jmo; its only the newest puzzle
<Jmo> :P
<Gold_Demona> I love sudoku. =D
<Gold_Demona> I've practically beaten all the sudoku puzzles on both of my Brain Age games
<PillowPoni|Phone> It confuses the shit outta me and makes me rage quit
*SafariMonkey admits he looked up adoku, thinking it was some japanese thing
<PillowPoni|Phone> I prefer fill-it-in puzzles
<Gold_Demona> The concept is simple. Each row must have the numbers 1-9 without repeats, each column must also have 1-9 without repeats, and each box has to have 1-9 without repeats.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Safari_Monkey, how did that go?
<SafariMonkey> *audoku
<PillowPoni|Phone> I've tried it...was not amused
<Gold_Demona> The hard part is getting the hang of that concept. :P
<Gold_Demona> It's not for everyone I suppose. I like it at any rate. =)
<SafariMonkey> PillowPoni|Phone: nothing interesting
<PillowPoni|Phone> SafariMonkey: aww
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Then you know that the minimum clue-count has been proven to be 17.
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Hm? What do you mean?
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: A puzzle with 16 clues or less is unsolvable
<SafariMonkey> PillowPoni|Phone: Well, there's this
<SafariMonkey> http://photobucket.com/images/Audoku/
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Ah, I see. I've never tried to make a puzzle, so I never paid attention to the clue count. XD
<PillowPoni|Phone> SafariMonkey: not a puzzle but it looks awesome
<PillowPoni|Phone> Looks like a Neopet(?)
<SafariMonkey> PillowPoni|Phone: http://www.neopets.com/~audoku
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone getting a stream? Also, hello! :)
*PillowPoni|Phone has never had a Neopet
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: no stream, and hello! :)
*AJIsAwesome was never interested in Neopets
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hello AJ
<AJIsAwesome> Hi MadSurge and SpadeMagnes[School] :)
*SafariMonkey has no clue what a NeoPet is
*SafariMonkey grew up in africa

<Saturn> 08,01which meant i had to work all night
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Okay. Maybe you should rearrange your schedule then. :D

<Meanwhile> That seems to be a recurring bug atm.
<SafariMonkey> Yay for resilient computers!
<Meanwhile> Seen 3 people so far just gliding across the floor. It's quite funny really.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have not seen Invalid String since the nda was lifted and the new patch came out.

<SafariMonkey> Hi Shizuka
<Snow> oh derpy.
<Saturn> 08,01if you had to choose one mod to buy a plushie of, who would it be?
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: I'm saving that one. :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. My...
<Saturn> 08,01and how much would you pay?
<Meanwhile> Shizu: http://i.imgur.com/4xEuq.gif

<Barbetos|AtWork> That derpy pic nearly killed me.
<Saturn> 08,01all her bits? got it.
<Snow> idk, because i dont know all the mods OC
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Saturn> 08,01i'd quite like either a Sumica or a Nittany_Discord
<twilight_sprinkle> but thats a highly flammable question, Saturn
<Sylandest> Saturn: I'd buy a plushie of Sumi's OC, or Phase's. and I'd say...a good fair amount
<Meanwhile> If I /have/ to choose or want to choose.
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: zomg yes, phase has an adorable OC!
<Sylandest> Saturn: precisely :)
<Sylandest> he'd even come with a tiny little rocket
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, a plushie of*. i cant read
<Saturn> 08,01i'd get a SlurryMoon plushie, but only if it talked
<Sylandest> XD
<Gold_Demona> I'd get a Sumi plushie
<Sylandest> Saturn: Would the Wrek plushie come with a battle axe?
<Gold_Demona> Because pony Sumi is best dancer
<twilight_sprinkle> id get a sumi plushie too i think
<Meanwhile> If it were my choice I'd save my money, if I had to I guess I'd invest in a dari one and tie it to a firework.
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: maybe a ban hammer
<Sylandest> Saturn: even better :D
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: No Wrek plushie would have a big hammer with "ban" written on it
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Sumica> 00,10Luna bcause luna
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: it'd be thor's hammer

<Sylandest> but it
<Gold_Demona> I'd get a Wrek plushie if it came with a huge hammer
<Shizuka> 13and plushie bread
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The ships seem to move really clunky
<Sylandest> *buy it now
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lil_B for all the pings!

<Meanwhile> Massaging what is the question?
<Lil_B> Saturn sure :) we believe you have only the best intends :)
<Eli> Snow: yeah! looking for group
<Sylandest> Moopy: do not advertise our channel, please
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: i'm sick of this now
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ghastly Gorge In the Groove Pony Mod
<Meanwhile> Moopy: Good, because if anyone belongs in there, you do.
<prince-dari> Seriously, next person to advertise dashiesauce is getting banned
<Panda|Lecture> Saturn... its to make it so it doesnt bunch up, and maintains it shape, right?
<prince-dari> You have been warned.
<Lil_B> Panda|Lecture just a sec, I'll get a link
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: i kicked you before, you've been warned and warned
<Moopy> Ok ok ok im sorry guys
<Eli> Snow: hard not to read when you're playing wow on a RPG server :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: favorite classical piece? im looking for music to fill the time
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: you're lucky i'm too tired to want to bother with updating our ban list
<SafariMonkey> Moopy: ಠ_ಠ
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: otherwise, you'd be gone
<Snow> Eli: lol, it has so little to do with wow now :P
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: consider this your final warning. any more advertising, and it's a *permanent* ban.
<Moopy> Wow really just because all this? would you guys stop getting mad at me
<Meanwhile> When you wise up and stop being a dingbat.
<Sylandest> Moopy: its against the rules. no means no.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: stop breaking rules and we'll stop getting mad
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i mean Moopy
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile is <3
<Meanwhile> I am?
<Eli> Snow: true. I stopped playing wow anyways, so i don't really care. Richard isn't as awesome as he once was anyways. i liked him better when he was a heartless puppy killer <3
<Moopy> Fine i'll stop then
<Meanwhile> Yay. ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: you really should know better by now
<Nife> yay~
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<Saturn> 08,01end of topic
<Saturn> 08,01let's talk about happy funtimes
<Moopy> Wow..........:|
<SafariMonkey> Oh hey Nife
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: What's your favorite food? :)
<Snow> Eli: well, he still is, but he got a little bit more....backgroundstory now.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: answer my question plz?:P
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: various curries
<Nife> Allo SafariMonkey
<Meanwhile> I changed my mind about the plushie though, I want a Saturn one now. Purely because it comes with a "massager"
<AJIsAwesome> Oooh, nice. :O
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: vaughn williams' fantasia on a theme of thomas tallis is really nice
<Eli> Snow: meh... turnig human is lame... I want more "FOR PONIES!" and blazing battles
<Snow> Meanwhile: what kind of massager? for stress or for sport injuries?
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: kthx, imma check it out. i need new musics
<Meanwhile> Snow: Yeah...for that.
<Sumica> 00,10if Saturn is designing them I dont want to know what mine comes with
<AJIsAwesome> One of my favorite pieces is Pavane for a Dead Princess. Sounds dark but it's a very nice and calm piece. :)
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: it does not come with what will now forever be known in this fandom as a "Lyra hole"
<Cades> hey
<Meanwhile> Hahahaha
<AJIsAwesome> I remember that. :S
<Snow> Meanwhile: uhhh, that does not awnser my question?
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: removable clothing.
<Bronysith> Saturn: you making plushies?
<Panda|Lecture> Saturn, I didn't know that you designed plushies.
<Meanwhile> Snow: How does that not answer the question? It was a confirmation of criteria YOU specified.
<Saturn> 08,01i don't!
<Moopy> Look im just going to refresh the whole page and i will never do it again *SIGH*god
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not artistic
<Sumica> 00,10yet
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just musing on the subject
<SafariMonkey> "you can do my hair, undress me anywhere!"
<Panda|Lecture> Saturn, oh.
<Snow> Meanwhile: oh, so it was both options?
<Saturn> 08,01thinking of commissioning a Sumica plushy, if it's fine with him
<Nife> Aaaah! It's Panda, my challenger!
<Cynder7> 6Heya ^^
<Sumica> 00,10I would not mind
<Meanwhile> Sumica's presumably comes with reporter punching action, deus ex shades, and when you squeeze his hoof it'll say "I never asked for this"
<Eli> should make a plushie for Saturn with voice device saying "my body is ready"
<Saturn> 08,01and putting it up for auction, with the proceeds going to charity
<Sumica> 00,10would like to see the finish product
<Snow> Eli: oh god great idea
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: or "come to bed"
<Meanwhile> And then it vibrates.
<Lil_B> Saturn or the [CONSORED] Cutie mark :)
<Dumorimasoddaa> Or a whole selection of phrases
<PillowPoni|Phone> I get off the phone and come back to plushie talk
<PillowPoni|Phone> Oh god what is going on?
<Lil_B> With the very big smile :)
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni|Phone: That's Bronystate for you. :D
<Saturn> 08,01PillowPoni|Phone: plushies! pushies everywhere!

<Saturn> 08,01Eli: ... for a relaxing massage?
<PillowPoni|Phone> Lol Snow
<Meanwhile> Tanks have no time to do things like "Identify friendlies" they're too busy blowing shit up.
<AJIsAwesome> I wish I had a plushie, but they cost too much. :D

<Meanwhile> No one cares anymore Moop.
*PillowPoni|Phone wants a creeper pony plushie

<Sumica> 00,10you know it's odd Saturn, I never realy though of having an OC plushie done before,
<Snow> Discord is best pony!
<Lil_B> Panda|Lecture only my very first version I made via Pony Maker :/ but it lacks the coat, safty goggles and generally uniqueness :/
<Cynder7> 6I wonder if I'll ever manage to sleep at a decent hour.. ._. :P
<Moopy> well scroll up the chatbox and see for yourself
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Moopy sorry man
<Pinkies4thWall> Wait, who's playing what?

<Cades> just at school
<Cynder7> 6:O Nice ^^
<Sylandest> prince-dari: sums us up pretty easily :D
<Panda|Lecture> prince-dari, too bad it is outdated.
<Lil_B> Panda|Lecture but if you would make something for me... I would really need something like an Icon for my music :( All my Profiles just have a blank picture, I made something myself, but it doesn't look so good, just some more pixel art :)
<twilight_sprinkle> oh is this the part where we make of americans?
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: fun*
<Panda|Lecture> Lil_B, so a 200x200 icon would suffice? I was planning on doing a CD cover for you.
<Snow> hmm... i think this game is too chaotic for me
<Cades> do ALL the homework :p
<Snow> ill keep it to tf2
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: not really. not if its every day the same thing
<Moopy> :| :|
<Petrified_Discord> Snow: Discord levels of chaotic
<Lil_B> Panda|Lecture and no worrys about the colors, blonde-brown hair Blue/purple (or blue/green) eyes, and blue body would be nic :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: oh i see, nvm
<Dark_Horst> why chaotic?
<Applejack2012> comes with choclate rain
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i barely slept today, dont yell at me D:

*Pinkies4thWall is nomming a gallon of root beer
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: i wouldn't. mostly, because it's kinda hard over the internet. but I could use Cantelock if you like? :)
<Moopy> asfdvbsfbdfbdvvbxdf
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkies4thWall: Lucky :(
<PillowPoni|Phone> Are there any Harry Potter ponies? I haven't seen a pic of one so far
<Petrified_Discord> Can you nom a liquid? If not, what would the liquid equivalent be? :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: nah, not this time :P
<Lil_B> Panda|Lecture the very fakt you do something for me is so awesome, it could be anything :)
<Sylandest> PillowPoni|Phone: im sure there's some out there somewhere
<PillowPoni|Phone> I've seen El Dorado ponies
*AJIsAwesome is feeling sick :D
<Pinkies4thWall> Okay, i lied. it's actually ginger ale
<PillowPoni|Phone> Sylandest: pretty sure too
<Snow> thats just it.. when i do that i keep standing in one place
<Applejack2012> The pony at the funeral looks like HP
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkies4thWall: Y U DO THAT? :(
<Eli> Petrified_Discord: glub?
<Panda|Lecture> Lil_B, you may have to remind me of the eye color in the near future. I have someone homework I wish to turn in this evening and my brain capasity is quite small. Also, not an issue, Ive been planning on doing something for you since I found you were a music composer.
<Pinkies4thWall> because ginger ale is yummy
<Petrified_Discord> Eli: ...it works. kinda makes me think of fish :P
<Panda|Lecture> Whoops, pardon if that appears to be a wall.
<Snow> ill keep it to sasparilla
*Pinkies4thWall hugs AJIsAwesome

*AJIsAwesome hugs Pinkies4thWall "It's okay" :)
<Pinkies4thWall> CIDER

<PillowPoni|Phone> Eli: yes. That very one

<PillowPoni|Phone> Eli: I have it favorited on deviantart
<Applejack2012> cute cenera ponies

<Pinkies4thWall> EVERYPONYRUN
<PillowPoni|Phone> Snow: pinkie on energy drinks. A scary thought indeed
<Meanwhile> Pinkie on energy drink would probably be like Hammy from Over the Hedge.
<alexxm> dinner
<Lil_B> ... and GilDash Plushy for Saturn ... I actually think that would be the most fitting XD
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: times fifty
<PillowPoni|Phone> Meanwhile: it would probably be worse than that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pinkie Pie already has a bunch of sugar daily though
<GilDash> Lil_B: Whoa, wait, what?
<Lil_B> GilDash we were previously talking abut Plushys of OCs for Saturn XD
<Cades> yeah
<Cades> gtg, cya later :D

<PillowPoni|Phone> Eli: attackwithhugs.deviantart.com. its on my favprites because I tried searching el dorado ponies and it doesn't turn up

<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Snow> thought i heard:Sentry going up in the background
<Eli> Snow: there's no such thing as too much TF2
<thelonepony> is Wrek Playing Planetside II beta again?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
*Bronysith sets Sumica on fire
<Snow> unless you had a half hour nothing of w+m1 pyro's and snipers on the other team
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if he isplaying the best class for assaults
<Snow> oh, almost forgot.
*Snow douses Sumica with water
<Lil_B> ohei new Wrak it Ralph Trailer, one of the very few Movies I really want to see... actually the first one in 2 years -.-
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: IKR
<Gold_Demona> That movie looks awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Same here.
<AJIsAwesome> And this is coming from a guy who doesn't really watch movies.
<Lil_B> ... wow ... the beginning of the Trailer had "Funky Town" in the Background XD
<AJIsAwesome> I love how they got M. Bison into the movie. Hope he does his signature catchphrase. :D
<Lil_B> ... it got some adult humor... so far I only see + Points everywhere
<Applejack2012> looking forward to Wreck it Ralph
<alexxm> yeah it looks like it was being made by gamers
<Snow> this is what i mean with too chaotic
<Snow> explosions everywhere and people shooting from all directions
<Snow> anyone else having lag?
<Lil_B> this trailer told me: it's aweesome, it's awesome it's awesome, it has some adult humor, recognisable soudnclips (Super Mario coin sounds, and other recognisable sounds of which i forgot the origin), other nice touchs liek 2 frame walkin animation for a deteiled 3D Character XD
<Gold_Demona> They also have Bowser and Eggman in the movie, which is a huge plus for me
<Sumica> 00,10oh wow the game has night time?
<Meanwhile> Aye
<Meanwhile> day and night cycles
<Gold_Demona> And a Pacman Ghost. And Q-Bert.
<Lil_B> and Q-bert
<Meanwhile> Every few hours apparently.
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Adult humor? Could you say where?
<Gold_Demona> What adult humor? O_o
<AJIsAwesome> i haven't seen a lot of the trailers, so I wouldn't know.
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome can I send you the link to the Trailer? only 2:30
<AJIsAwesome> PM it. :)
<Snow> Lil_B: you mean like the tanananaaaa! sound from zelda?
<Jmo> LOL^
<Barbetos|AtWork> wow
<Barbetos|AtWork> so close
<Lil_B> Snow no, ... wait, I may know which one I mean, I'm checking it right now XD
<Sumica> 00,10what's that wrek?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lib tail gunner did that?
<SafariMonkey> WB Polydunami
<Lil_B> Barbetos|AtWork I don't know still have to check
<Snow> how can you see a damm thing in the night cycle there!?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lil_B wut? o_o
<Barbetos|AtWork> mos-quit-o
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Where did you see the Adult humor? :S
<Sumica> 00,10fighters are not your personal missle/transport
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome I though the A Heros Duity line was that :/ maybe I just got it wrong
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Oh. I would find that as dirty humor rather than adult, IMO.
<Polydunami> Had to restart my computer; my client logs me in every single time I open it :S
<Polydunami> And, well, it opens automatically whenever I turn my computer on.
<AJIsAwesome> Sometime flash crashes my browser. I hate it when that happens. :|
<Polydunami> It's not been so common for me, lately
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica: you would be surprised how many people use the Galaxy to get around.
<AJIsAwesome> So then I have to reboot my comupter to get flash working again.
<Polydunami> Anyway, I'll be back later.
<Barbetos|AtWork> As personal transport that is
<AJIsAwesome> Also, it prevents my browser from fully working UNLESS I reboot ot. :|
<Lil_B> kinda fouind the noise... the one I meant sound sextremly similar to (actually it's the same but the last 2 notes are missing) the sound after the zelda theme when you start the Famicom Disc System
<Sumica> 00,10I presume that is the name of the fighter Barbetos|AtWork?
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: "sextremly" Hehe.
<Sonny> urgh this drawing is taking forever °-°
<Lil_B> ... extremly*
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: ;)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica: that is the huge transport gunship wrek was just at.
<Sumica> 00,10I ment the single seater wrek used to torppedo in to the said of a transport
<Shizuka> 13sumica never saw me play tribes :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> That is a mosquito for the Terran, which is the team he is on.
<Sumica> 00,10tribes it made sence Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13eliterenegades, the cloaked single-seater... also known as shizu's kamikaze run :3
<Sumica> 00,10mostly cause tribes had no limits or cost
<Sumica> 00,10hell I used to yse the HPC as a battering ram for doors
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Hiyo! Also, why am I not surprised you use suicide warriors? :D
<Meanwhile> Dat clipping.
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Meanwhile> Now if only we could stick bombs to pyros on TF2.
<Shizuka> 13i usually loaded up a transport, flew over, and as soon as everyone unloaded, went and crashed it into a turret somewhere
<Snow> hell yeah, especially w+m1 pyros
<Meanwhile> Implying there's any other kind.
<Lil_B> 2 Games I wrould really like to see, but which are so rare appearently that there isn't even one video in english about in anywhere... SHin Onigashima and Famicom Tantei Clup ... 2 original Nintendo japan only Nintendo games for the NES
<Dragonmatte> What is this? :S
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: only if the pyro goes "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA" while holding his bombs :D
<Shizuka> 13course i was usually flagrunner too.. lightest class, pulse grenades, just bounce from one end of the world to the other
<Shizuka> 13tribes 2 was fun and all with the bombers, but i missed eliteren so much
<thelonepony> Planetside II Beta Dragonmatte
<Snow> Meanwhile: yes there is, i am for instant a support pyro
<Dragonmatte> Okay :3
<Meanwhile> Snow: Ah yes the elusive "Camp the dispenser" Pyro. Seen it's natural habitat using m1 without the w.
<Snow> Meanwhile: not realy, im using m2 or homewrecker for most of the time.
<Meanwhile> I'm just poking fun at the class, I know it's just as useful as any other.
<Meanwhile> Still, gluing sticky bombs to a teammate would be neat.
<Snow> or be able to take your sentry with you so it can still shoot while you move
<Shizuka> 13depends if friendly fire would be enabled for those bombs
<Meanwhile> Wasn't that something in the workshop? Shoulder mounted sentry gun?
<Snow> so not packing it up, but picking it up like it stands
<Shizuka> 13sticky bombed pyro rushes the enemy, the demo pops them, pyro walks out
<Lil_B> I just watched the Trailer for the Kirbys 20th anniversary Dream Collection "rated E 10+ for Animated Blood and Cartoon Violence" XD
<Snow> @Shizuka: if that is possible illbe playing offensive pyro more often
<Meanwhile> Well friendly fire is only on on peculiar servers anyway, no reason to enable it solely for the purpose of blowing yourselves up.
*Shizuka 13ran detpack so often in tribes.... run in, suicide with explosion before anyone notices
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: :D
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome these are 6 games, and the only part where you see Blood is in the Crystal Shards, the Final Boss Zero two , who bleeds blood from his eye when you shoot him XD
<Snow> O.o even better
<Snow> scout with bombs attached to him
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Oh, that game. Okay.
<Meanwhile> What could work is having something akin to several stickies that you can attach to a player and only detonate once they're dead.
<Meanwhile> Like sticking a C4 pack to a spy so in the event their sap attempt fails they can still die on a sentry nest and hope the explosion's in range.
<Snow> Meanwhile: use that on a deadringer spy and win.
<Lil_B> I want that Box, I want the Soundtrack CD and I want to lay the Gameboy games on the TV XD
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't say that's any harsher than sticky bombs already are.
<Meanwhile> Corner? Sticky bombs.
<Meanwhile> Arch? Sticky bombs.
<Shizuka> 13sentry buster for tenth class, who's with me
<Meanwhile> Spawn door? Sticky bombs.
<Shizuka> 13high health, but can only blow up
<Meanwhile> I still want that dog that showed up a while back as tenth class.
<Snow> @shizuka: no, just no... they have a too damm high respawn rate.
<Meanwhile> Besides, imagine how many times you'd walk out of spawn and blow up.
<Meanwhile> It'd be worse than democamp.
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13timer?
<Snow> or 3 demo medic ubered team
<Shizuka> 13buster has enough time to get to mid
<Shizuka> 13except teleporters
<Meanwhile> That could work but it'd only take a certain amount of time before the border of it's range becomes common knowledge and it becomes fairly pointless.
<Shizuka> 13but even then, uber
<Bronysith> a
<Snow> is a good idea, but no thanks
<Snow> we engineers have enough troubles to worry about
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Shizuka> 13not until you're as twitchy eyed ultraparanoid as i am when i get stuck playing engie
<Bronysith> scout is awesome times
<Shizuka> 13every last pixel on the screen is a spy
<Snow> spies are the last thing im worried about
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Learn and Blossom / The lost kingdom Battle theme / Griffin's Lullaby
<MLP_Brovakiin> lol I have no idea what is going on :P I've just got back
<sagas> Whats being played?
<Meanwhile> When I play engi I always seem to attract the ire of every explosive class in game.
<Snow> demo's and soldiers
<Snow> thats my problem
<Meanwhile> I don't mind spies much because the average spy is terrible.
<sagas> What game is this?
<Meanwhile> And will come running straight at you like a wally.
<Meanwhile> Or even better, will use dead ringer from the start and decloak right around a corner.
<Snow> then play spy like me: eternal reward set bonus+dead ringer
<Meanwhile> Pfft. Dead ringer.
<Snow> they wont hear you uncloaking even if your next to him
<Shizuka> 13except familiar fez is lame
*sagas is still waiting to find out what game this is....
<Meanwhile> It really is.
<Ouroboros> It's the Planetside2 beta
<sagas> thanks Ouroboros
<Shizuka> 13pay $7 to make spy less astoundingly obvious
<Snow> dont care, set bonus is awsome IMO
<Meanwhile> And if you don't have a disguise, it's fairly obvious what you're using and then they become even more alert.
<Ouroboros> What server are you playing on? Unfortuantely I get unplayable lag.
<sagas> never heard of it, but it looks good
<Wrek> 05Ouroboros: EU2
<Ouroboros> The little I've managed to play is fun
<Ouroboros> Thanks Wrek.
<Meanwhile> And an alert engi is the hardest to stab.
<nerf_soldier> how long has wrek been streaming?
<Snow> thats why you need to get him when hes distracted
<Meanwhile> If you can get up close and juggle the sapper well enough you might be able to get the backstab while he's repairing but that's paramount to flipping a coin.
<Snow> thats the way of the spy, get people who are distracted or occupied
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<Meanwhile> Allo T.
<Snow> if your quick enough you can backstab the engie and sap his sentry before it turns around
<Meanwhile> you're*
<Meanwhile> And that's basic.
<Meanwhile> That's like "Right click to zoom the sniper scope"
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Gold_Demona> Welp, I'm gonna head out for the day. See y'all tomorrow Bronystate
<Snow> i hate snipers
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/H4rn3.jpg
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Gold_Demona :)
<Meanwhile> Hell if you're next to a sentry you can just run around it and stab it to death as long as you don't slow down.
<alexxm> bye Gold_Demona
<Snow> i hate them with all my hatered
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Toast ?
<Gold_Demona> And Jmo, I'll probably have the next Nuzlocke page out tomorrow. :3
<Gold_Demona> Later all
<Shizuka> 13toast
<Meanwhile> I like playing as sniper, but again, it seems to be magnetic because projectiles will inexplicably find their way to my face.
<Snow> but yeah, on previous topic. most spies are kinda stupid
<Meanwhile> Most spies are incredibly stupid.
<Snow> even seen a few backstabbing a razorbak sniper
<Lil_B> well... it's now proven that some video games like some shooters can improve/restore eyesight, awesome
<Snow> razorback*
<Meanwhile> Razorback is the reason revolvers exist.
<Snow> ikr
<Snow> when im not using set, shooting razorback snipers down with enforcer
<Meanwhile> Really, razorback is the most pointless item in existence.
<Snow> well, not realy. it keeps you safe from noobs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> second place belong to tape red recorder
<Meanwhile> Noobs decloak close enough for you to hear them.
<Snow> thats just a troll weapon
<doughnutjoe> oooohhh
<doughnutjoe> What game is this?
<Meanwhile> In which case you can turn around and blank them with a headshot before they even finishl
<Ouroboros> Its Planetside2.
<Meanwhile> The number of times I've been called a hacker because people don't understand that decloaking is loud...
<sagas> reminds me of battlefield 2142
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile Ever played tribes ascend?
<Meanwhile> I have, don't really like it.
<Snow> well, i have seen spies who are not so noob but are still noob enough to backstab a razorback sniper
<Snow> what i mean with that is right distance for decloaking
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> unless you are using the fez set wich makes the declock sound weaker
<Meanwhile> If you're using the fez set you're probably rolling dead ringer.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like the dead ringer
<Snow> not realy, i sometimes use cloack and dagger with that
<Snow> cloak*
<Meanwhile> Eh, I prefer to lurk quietly and wait for the opportune moment.
<Meanwhile> Thing is, the fez set makes you much more vulnerable to sentries because of the daggers disguise removal.
<Ouroboros> Might be worth trying with a joystick.
<Snow> but when i played for the first time spy, i fell for the razorback thingie too. but thats because i didnt knew what it did back then.
<Meanwhile> Well that's the key to playing in general really, identify what's being used and how it works.
<Snow> but i hardly play sniper, because of 2 reasons: i aim like shit and they always headshot me even when im out of line ofe sight
<Meanwhile> I'd blame that second problem on your connection speed.
<Meanwhile> And the first one is just practice.
<Sonny> sup
<Snow> umm... not realy
<Snow> having 2 ping isnt that bad
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i play better spy and sniper with a controller for some reason
<Wrek> 05LOLD
<Wrek> 05damned thign flew right into me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek that useful friend
<Snow> *badum tish*
<Meanwhile> He only wanted a hug.
<Sonny> yup
<Sonny> hi Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Hello Sonny.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo the point of the game is to capture all the land ?
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yup
*Bronysith sets TheGreatAndPowerfulT on fire
<Meanwhile> Capture ALL the land!
<Snow> well, im sorry guys but i have to go...school tommorow.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Snow
<AJIsAwesome> Snow: Night! :)
<MASF123> Wrek is streaming I see.
<Meanwhile> Why do so many people begin with "I see x is streaming" or "x is streaming I see"
<MASF123> Because we can, Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> Yeah, we were here before you, we know who's streaming already.
<Sonny> Meanwhile: do you make fan art?
<Meanwhile> We were privvy to that information prior to your arrival.
<Meanwhile> Sonny: I do not. Because I am lazy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile conversation starter as far as i know
<Sonny> lol k
<Meanwhile> T: What's wrong with "Hello everyone"
<MASF123> Hello everypony!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile how should i know ? i say hi when i get on chat
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: Hello! :)
<alexxm> how are things MASF123
<MASF123> Hello Honey, Hello Dexter, Hello Dee Dee, Hello Honey........Hello Honey!
<thelonepony> hi MASF123
<PillowPoni> You know what would be awesome?
<MASF123> alexxm, not too good but not horrible.
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: WHat?
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: The Men In Black
<AJIsAwesome> I never watched any of the MIB movies. :D
<MASF123> PillowPoni, Men in Black III was awesome.
<MASF123> All 3 were good, I thought the last one may have sucked but it didn't.
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: Men In Black. That agency that monitors all alien activity on Earth
<PillowPoni> MASF123: I haven't seen the third one yet
*Meanwhile neuralyses PillowPoni.
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: I know that. I just never liked it. :D
<MASF123> Agents, from A-Z
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Well my sister got it from the flea market but I didn't watch it
*PillowPoni deneuralyzes myself
<Meanwhile> That reminds me, I swear the MIB has more agents than there are letters in the alphabet.
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile, so did I...after watching the second one 50 times
<MASF123> PillowPoni, there are no such things as aliens, and you must take off your clothes. >_>
<Meanwhile> What do they start using as code when they run out of letters.
<PillowPoni> A letter an a random number, probably.
<PillowPoni> MASF123: lolol so you think
<Meanwhile> I pity whoever got M4.
<PillowPoni> Jeff is best six foot worm
<Meanwhile> Pfft, run over by hovertank.
<MASF123> He lives in the subways which makes him boss.
<Meanwhile> Not the most dignified of deaths.
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Yep
<PillowPoni> It would be cool to work for them but knowing me...I'd end up neuralyzing myself instead of witnesses by accident
<MASF123> What's wrong with that?
<Meanwhile> I'd neuralyse random people on the street and have them swap lives.
<Meanwhile> Sending random strangers to peoples houses under the impression they live there just for the reaction.
<MASF123> Agent M is Micheal Jackson. Lol.
<MASF123> Meanwhile, you will be decommisioned
<Meanwhile> Worth it.
<PillowPoni> But wouldn't Meanwhile be agent M?
<MASF123> Not really, no.
<MASF123> Meanwhile is Agent M.
<MASF123> Wait, I'm Agent M too then.
<Meanwhile> Shush you, you don't get to decide what is and isn't worth it to me.
<PillowPoni> I'd be agent P
<LadyCanary> Oh look! A Wreky stream ^_^
<PillowPoni> Wait, no I woulndn't.....
<MASF123> Agent M123
<AJIsAwesome> ohai LadyCanary :)
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Well you'd be distinguishable from the other Agent M's
<MASF123> Yeah Ikr
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai LadyCanary
<Meanwhile> Well that guy was certainly resilient to being stabbed in the head.
<PillowPoni> Hi LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Hiya~
<MASF123> Agent L
<MadSurge> LadyCanary! :)
<Meanwhile> Didn't L quit?
<LadyCanary> Ohai MadSurge
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: I think so. She wanted to be back with the dead people
<MASF123> Yeah but got a replacement, LadyCanary
<PillowPoni> Or was that the old dude at the beginning of the first one?
<LadyCanary> ?
<MadSurge> Does that make me agent M, agent S or agent MS?
<Shizuka> 13canary canary~<3
<MASF123> Agent Microsoft, yet MadSurge
<MASF123> yes
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> people in UMvC3 who play online, are ridiculous
<Meanwhile> Heh, Agent Microsoft.
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu <3
<PillowPoni> Agent PP
<Bronysith> press start aaaand dead
<MASF123> AGent? PP?!?!?!
<PillowPoni> Nopoe, bad puns would come from that
<LadyCanary> ....Did saxy not warn you, SiTH?
<Meanwhile> PillowPoni: Oh yeah because that rolls off the tongue so well.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: no i knew about it
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: just did it for the luls
<thelonepony> agent tlp
<LadyCanary> Clearly, you did it to be an idiot.
<Bronysith> yup
<MASF123> AGent Tomatos Lemons Ponies
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: Well it's better than Agent F--Fluffy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> PillowPoni is agent p and MadSurge is agent MS and they are partners
<Meanwhile> I'd like to believe he's not an idiot by choice.
<Meanwhile> Because if he is he's the best troll to ever walk this earth.
<PillowPoni> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Aaaaaah see what you did there
<MASF123> Agent TgaPT
<Meanwhile> T: They only get one mission a month.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh
<PillowPoni> And whoever pisses us off goes missing for a while
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile it would be a bloody hard mission ?
<PillowPoni> Shut up Meanwhile, not cool :>
<Meanwhile> Hahahaha
<MadSurge> Welp PillowPoni :D
<MASF123> PillowPoni, how bout Agent Pillz?
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Never played L4D so that wouldn't work'

<Meanwhile> too*
<MASF123> too
<PillowPoni> MASF123: With what money?
<MASF123> Yours of course
<Bronysith> so there is only 1 mission a week on this game
<PillowPoni> MASF123: No job and I only get $100 every two weeks, which isn't enough to live off of
<MASF123> $100? I only get like $5
<Bronysith> i wonder what server and faction Wrek is on
<Meanwhile> EU2, Terran.
<Bronysith> thank you mao
<PillowPoni> MASF123: With having to put gas in the car every week, not much
<MASF123> Best MIB Agent ever is Agent PwnNee
<PillowPoni> That and I ALWAYS make a point to buy mechanical pencils
<MASF123> Agent PN
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Sounds like Agent PN would be a robot.
<MASF123> That's one of the rumors they say about him.
*PillowPoni wonders who her sidekick would be

<Sumica> 00,10this might take a bit.
<Wirisme> Good evening everyone, or whatever time it is where you are.
<Meanwhile> Allo Wirisme.
<AJIsAwesome> Wirisme: Hi! :)
<PillowPoni> Hello Wirisme
<Thrackerzod> how goes it?
<alexxm> how are things Wirisme and Thrackorzod
<Wirisme> Pretty good, what's been going on round these parts?
<Sumica> 00,10cant connect to netflix now so I guess that is it for now.
<XAX> Wirisme: Yeah, good morning is right c: Where abouts are you?
<Wirisme> UK
<Meanwhile> Well fudge. Thanks for trying Sumica.
<XAX> Ah.
<Wirisme> It's 9:14 pm here
<Meanwhile> What county you in Wiris?
<XAX> 8:14am here :p
<Wirisme> Lanc
<Meanwhile> Ah, Wilts.
<AJIsAwesome> 3:10 PM here.
<MadSurge> Awww
<Dark_Horst> say wut?
<Bronysith> and suddenly Sumica streaming some anime
<MadSurge> :O anime!
<alexxm> anime time? i thought we were watching doctor who
<Wirisme> Yay!
<MadSurge> Gundam?
<MadSurge> alexxm: browser crashed
<MadSurge> Here, let me slide around.
<Dark_Horst> look at them trying to do micro gravity! look at them and laugh!
<Wirisme> I was just looking at a floppy drive music tutorial. It just really confused me lol
<LadyCanary> Errmahgurd GUNDAMZ
<MadSurge> Yes, it's Gundam!
<thelonepony> Gundam 00
<Meanwhile> Welp, I know nothing whatsoever of Gundam, but I'm sure if there are giant robots beating each other up at some point I'll manage to enjoy it.
<Wirisme> Then this will be my introduction
<Sumica> 00,10yeah sort of the back up plan
<LadyCanary> Lockon bby
<Kandarihu> Alright
<Sumica> 00,10got english version so people dont have to read
<XAX> Oh no, reading.
<Wirisme> I like subs though
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i know the horror
<Meanwhile> Heaven forbid we have to read.
<Sumica> 00,10wont matter any ways, now we will have an omg dubs suck now
<Wirisme> When will we learn?
<Eli> :3
<Wirisme> Declare war on war
<Kandarihu> Well, normally, I prefer subs over dubs. However, if the bitrate constraints result in too much compression, the subs will become illegible
<Sumica> 00,10Dont think that has ever been an issue has it Kandarihu?
<Eli> Kandarihu: i think my brain just melted... too late for fancy words
<Meanwhile> I prefer subs too, usually because dub actors usually suck.
<Meanwhile> Too many usually's in that sentence*
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Agreed.
*PillowPoni|Minecraft likes reading
*Eli agrees with PillowPoni|Minecraft
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Reading is awesome
<Eli> it is
<Sumica> 00,10at least it's a bit more recent an anime so the voices will be better then avrage.
<Dark_Horst> smirnoff?
<thelonepony> ^ :D
<Kandarihu> The main trauma that haunts me from dubbed anime is the absurd bowlderization for when it's adapted for children's TV. But I do generally prefer the original Japanese voice acting over a non-native dub.
<Flyboy> whats this?
<Eli> yellow eyes! main character.
<Kandarihu> I'm fine with this, though
<MadSurge> Sumica: Ah, the eternal conflict, dubs vs. subs
<Dark_Horst> Flyboy: gundam
<alexxm> boom
<Wirisme> Or just learn Japanese :p
<Sumica> 00,10they missed
<MadSurge> DED
<AJIsAwesome> "I'm okay!"
<Dark_Horst> fuck that, the japanes have an extra letter for every goldfish and his mom
<Eli> i once tried watching OP and Fairy tail... Luffys or Happys voice is just unbearable
<Sumica> 00,10you got human on my shirt
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: AGreed.
<MadSurge> Doesn't give a fuck like a boss
<Kandarihu> Eli, the dub of One Piece?
<Eli> Kandarihu: yeah
<Ryunosuke> might help if I typed the channel name correctly
<Ryunosuke> and we are NOT talking about 4kids are we?
<Meanwhile> Derrel Dodge.
<Dark_Horst> ...and they let that dipshit pilot a war machine?
<AJIsAwesome> I don'e even know why they tried to convert an anime meant for older audiences into a kid friendly show. :S
<AJIsAwesome> *don't*
<Ryunosuke> AJIsAwesome, because money
<Derp_Derp> bloop bloop hello everyone
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: he gotta get the HECK outta Dodge!
<Ryunosuke> well
<MadSurge> Hello Derp_Derp!
<Dark_Horst> ....vader?
<Ryunosuke> either a) money or b) animation - kids
<AJIsAwesome> Derp_Derp: bloop bloop :)
<Wirisme> That pretty much sums it up I'd say
<Dark_Horst> alright, so far we have a known vodka brand and the dark lord of the sith
<Dark_Horst> how did those guys not get sued?
<thelonepony> hi Derp_Derp
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: I know that, it's jst stupid how shoddy and terrible the US version is.
<AJIsAwesome> *just*
<Sumica> 00,10it veda not vader
<Ryunosuke> which is why as much as I support official releases, I do NOT watch any anime dubbed, it HAS to be subbed or nothing at all tbh
<Meanwhile> Sounds like vader, therefore vader.
<Eli> ah well. good night guys. got school tomorrow
<Dark_Horst> well, stil vodka
<Ryunosuke> 4kids ruined subbing for me
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Night! :)
<thelonepony> night Eli
<Ryunosuke> *Dubbing
<Sumica> 00,10indeed, still vodka
<Wirisme> Night Eli
<alexxm> bye Eli
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if that was his name
<Eli> Night. have fun with your anime :)
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: thankfully we have nothing like 4kids
<Dark_Horst> sounded like smirnoff
<Dark_Horst> except shmirnoff
<Bronysith> punch
<MadSurge> PLOTTING
<Dark_Horst> why are they all floating? that a station?
<MadSurge> STOP SLIDING, WAAAALK
<Sumica> 00,10yep, that was his name
<CCCP> hai...
<Meanwhile> Shmirnoff.
<FillyFlam> Hiya CCCP
<Ryunosuke> 'lo cccp
<Kandarihu> Well, One Piece is pretty much aimed for young children in Japan. It's not that 4Kids aimed to make it suitable for a demographic unlike what the original was for. They were tailoring it to a U.S. counterpart to the same demographic, but conforming to a buttload of vaguely defined zero-tolerance policies imposed on them by both the FCC and their own focus groups.
<thelonepony> hi CCCP
<MadSurge> Oh, that ball talking thing
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: ohai :)
<MadSurge> Hello CCCP!
<CCCP> hi FillyFlam Ryunosuke thelonepony AJIsAwesome and MadSurge
<CCCP> brb
<Dark_Horst> sparkle thrusters activate!
<Bronysith> and suddenly from the perspective of the muffin lord things look great
<MadSurge> Fabulous Gundams!
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: True. Very true. I
<Kandarihu> Oh, and I think they're one of the companies whose censors work on a quota system. Because of this, they HAVE to censor enough stuff in order for the censors to be seen as doing their jobs.
<CCCP> back
<Sumica> 00,10nice hats
<Dark_Horst> open hair in micro gravity
<Ryunosuke> which brings me directly back to subs vs dubs
<Dark_Horst> becasue that is SUCH a good idea
<Meanwhile> Myah.
<MadSurge> So, is this the most recent Gundam series or did they do another in the meantime?
<Ryunosuke> rather not subs vs dubs but rather fan subs vs dubs
<Sumica> 00,10they have done a remake of classic sence this one
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, there have been newer series. One is caled Gundam U.C. and I forgot the name of the other one, Ages?
<Dark_Horst> pew!
<MadSurge> What the hell is celestial being? a laser?
<Kandarihu> U.C. is the controversial series written by an extreme Japanese nationalist, with six months between each episode's release.
<Dark_Horst> man... brilliant soldier
<Sumica> 00,10the name of the orgnisiztion
<Meanwhile> Celestial Being is the group's name I thinkl
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, yes
<Bronysith> ;pp
<Dark_Horst> ....so why is the scope INSIDE the cockpit?
<MadSurge> Because cool and computers
<Sumica> 00,10how else would you aim it
<Dark_Horst> wouldnt it make more sense to have guidance systems outside the vehicle?
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: HUD
<MadSurge> Dat yay :D
<Dark_Horst> swinging that huge thing around in the cockpit seems to limit the maneuverability of the weapon greatly
<Dark_Horst> *smartass*
<Hipster-Pony> derp
<alexxm> jack of all stats gundam
<Hipster-Pony> hi
<Dark_Horst> mary-sue bots
<Zawan> how long has anime time been on ?

<Zawan> oh so only this episode then
<Hipster-Pony> what are we watching next?
<MadSurge> Who the hell are the two chicks discussing?
<MadSurge> Welp, the end
<Sumica> 00,10the two chick were discussing the actions of the gundams
<Dark_Horst> okay, maybe longer than 15 minutes then
<Hipster-Pony> I how no idea what's going on
<MadSurge> ^
<Dark_Horst> i like mechwarrior
<Dark_Horst> western mech designs make such delicious sense
<Sumica> 00,10the one with out glasses is a leader of a country falling on hard times because they relyed on oil rather then supporting the solar power program
<MadSurge> Sumica: HA, idiots
<Hipster-Pony> CAN CAN!
<MadSurge> CAN CAN PONY!
<Hipster-Pony> YAY
<Wirisme> :D
<thelonepony> YAY!!

<StinkomanFan> Remember Madeupistan in Pandemic 4? It was even worse than Madagascar!
<MadSurge> Fake countries mixed with real ones, how quaint
<name> pew pew
<Kandarihu> Country has a name that ends in -stan, so it's clearly middle-eastern. But it can't be an Islamic country because the women are too nude-faced in public.

<cowvarkian> an water we watching
<Bronysith> note to self, always use caramel to sensor from now on
<XylemTube> I forget, what is this game called?
<AJIsAwesome> Press X to do stuff.
<mitamaking> so drying yourself? Best game ever?
<cowvarkian> are we watching press x to jason the game?
<CriticKitten> ....Heavy Rain, an action-packed thrill ride of drying yourself with towels!
<Derpy_Hooves> its heavy rain
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: that is one part of the game
<Derpy_Hooves> its not as bad as you think
<Meanwhile> You actually playing or is this a video?
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, yes
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian its just one part
<Cypresswolf> Its 45 minutes from quitting time & I get home early so I can go over some new hire training log - he calls to tell me of a list of things he wanted me to do today, then asked where I was...
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Caramel streaming?
<HappyCanary> AH! A Caramel stream ^_^
<Derpy_Hooves> heavy rain is not as bad as you think it is >.>
<cowvarkian> I know what it is, just making fun of it
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian and the game is fucking awesome
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: by that logic skyrim should be called "arrow to the knee"
<Derpy_Hooves> its pretty good
<mitamaking> So does this game get better?
<Michael> dat Caramel
<Bronysith> THAT is one sexy son of a bitch
<Derpy_Hooves> yes
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: go ahead then, what do I care
<Derpy_Hooves> mitamaking: yes it does
<Meanwhile> mitamaking: It's a mystery murder type thingy.
<pony_5009> dont cut youself! you'll get the bad ending!!!
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: or l4d is the "i hate everything" game
<Meanwhile> But it never stops being quicktime events.
<DaringDerpy> wife was nice in the intro, means she dies soon
<mitamaking> Meanwhile: The razor did it
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 he cuts himself. :D
<Bronysith> also known as Meanwhile s fav game of all time
<XylemTube> Everyday life: the video Game
<Meanwhile> I don't like this game.
<CriticKitten> Heavy Rain, an action-packed thrill ride of brushing your teeth!
<sub06905> if you dont dry just right you lose the game
<cowvarkian> or just the "press x to do y" game
<cachi01|phone> pony_5009 there are like 4 bad endings
<prince-dari> Leaving the tap on while brushing your teeth?
<prince-dari> How wasteful
<WildRepublicGuard> The sims
<DaringDerpy> extreme toothbrushing
<Meanwhile> It'd be fine if it was a movie.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: but they made it a core part of the game instead of just having 2 quicktime events throughout the whole fucking game
<Michael> all the wasted water
<Meanwhile> But it isn't. Therefore it sucks.
<Cypresswolf> Being the honest guy I am, I told him - :) My punishment - fix a flat cart tire thats been sitting there for a month (he exagerates :P - it was less than a week) Easy fix - reseal air tube ^_^
<Meanwhile> I don't want to play Quicktime Events: The Game.
<Meanwhile> I want to play games.
*cachi01|phone slaps Meanwhile
<mitamaking> I'm as clean as a whistle?
<cowvarkian> why are we hearing his thoughts
<XylemTube> The voice acting make's it soooo belivable
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: play shadow of the colossus, no quick time events there
<cowvarkian> his horribly acted thoughts
<Meanwhile> That's why I watched this whole game on youtube instead of buying ir.
<Meanwhile> it.*
<scout19_tf2> oh my god a game for living a normal life the gaming co has really hit an all time low
<Bronysith> ValtheJean: would you consider this game to be art?
<mitamaking> Why is the voice acting so bad
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: no
<DaringDerpy> work?
<Buytoast> This is an interesting movie.
<XylemTube> Juggleing = work
<mitamaking> Is his job a juggler?
<Michael> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> RAWR
<pony_5009> "better get some work done" starts juggleing...
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith not art. But its pretty awesome
<Meanwhile> I'd consider this game to be really shit at the whole "game" part.
<ValtheJean> 
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Nice. So overall, a pretty good day? :)
<DaringDerpy> audio failure?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmmm....I think I crashed it

*Pinkies4thWall is a person

<Pinkies4thWall> Who else is getting Borderlands 2?
<Bronysith> and suddenly i feel life putting a muffin on Meanwhile s head
<cowvarkian> mitamaking: it's completely possible
<Meanwhile> Who are you mysterious Pantsman?
<Klumzeedragon> Pinkies4thWall: ME! :)

<mitamaking> ValtheJean: Do they all have pants?
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: yes remind me to bitch slap you tomarrow
<Bronysith> Heavy rain is definetly art
<cowvarkian> mitamaking: supposedly
<Bronysith> pulls on the emotions of people
<CriticKitten> It does?
<HappyCanary> :3 Have fun Sumi!
<Bronysith> a man going through whatever it takes to save his daughter
<Sumica> 00,10this game makes me need to take a leak
<Bronysith> i mean son
<Klumzeedragon> Pinkies4thWall: I'll probably be Zero. :) I like sniping. But I'll probably start a Mechromancer in October. :D
<cowvarkian> people have emotions?
<mitamaking> It may be art because it is certainly not a game, hahahaha, no one has ever made that joke before
<cachi01|phone> Yeah i guess i can consider Heavy rain as art
<DoctoDoctorWho> Klumzeedragon: did you read my fic yet?
<Bronysith> The plot to this game is pretty much Taken the game
<Meanwhile> Heavy Rain is not art.
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: Just finished. :) Hence my visit here.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: kidnapping : the game
<mitamaking> Go juggle better
<Meanwhile> Heavy Rain is a movie with quicktime events.
<Sumica> 00,10wait, is this the sims for ps3?
*AJIsAwesome presses X to dodge DoctoDoctorWho's glomp
<Buytoast> Man, he can handle those balls like a French fiddler handles a bow.
*Bronysith murders Sumica with a shotgun
<Michael> wtf
<DoctoDoctorWho> Klumzeedragon: well? how was it?
<prince-dari> TBH Meanwhile
<DaringDerpy> we walks like one of these old scifi androids
<prince-dari> When this: http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/imgs/artists/emin-tracey/tracey-emin-my-bed.jpg
*cowvarkian presses x to press x
<prince-dari> Is considered art
<Meanwhile> Buytoast: I was expecting to read "French prostitute"
<sub06905> could be sims
<prince-dari> Fucking everything is
<Sumica> 00,10his balls finaly droped
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: lol dude i just notice the prologe on my unpublish on hiautus fic is longer than your entire story so far.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: dont forget a bunch of lines is considered art while graffity is vandalism
<mitamaking> like a boss
<Meanwhile> Well then dari, I present art. http://i.imgur.com/DRXo4.jpg
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: true story
<cachi01|phone> Meanwhile beautiful
<prince-dari> Truly beautiful
<prince-dari> Fuck
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: that is the most beautiful piece of art ever
<Buytoast> That spider is goddamn adorable.
<prince-dari> Damn you cachi01|phone
<Sumica> 00,10I forgot val is an inhuman monster with a trident. He loves quicktime events
<mitamaking> Maybe you shoul work first
<cachi01|phone> prince-dari yay :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 -_-
<Michael> that is art Meanwhile
<cowvarkian> Sumica: truth
*DoctoDoctorWho AJIsAwesome fails to dodge and is subsequently glomped
<AJIsAwesome> The evel powers of the "ninja'd" :P
<mitamaking> Now he is making art
<Buytoast> So is this movie about how they made the "Take On Me" music video?
<AJIsAwesome> *evil*
<Sumica> 00,10it looks realy good
*Bronysith puts Sumica in a full nelson
<Meanwhile> If a guy can display his shit bed as art then I can stick a moustache and a monocle on a spider and say the same thing.
*AJIsAwesome has been glomped :P
<Pinkies4thWall> I am off to the shower.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: tottaly
<Sumica> 00,10slightly confused as to why he is using a draftsman table if he is not useing the tools
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkies4thWall: Bye! :)
*Pinkies4thWall hugs random ponies
<Bronysith> this should have been a 9 hour movie instead of a game
<cowvarkian> Sumica: because he can
<Kinixys> Why's playing what looks like a commercial?
<Bronysith> but by god it is awesome
*Michael glomps Pinkies4thWall
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: hi! have you seen my fic yet?
<Sumica> 00,10stright lines with out a strght edge.
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: I enjoyed it. :) It's good so far and I can't wait to read more as it comes out. The only thing I found weird is how his magic is yellow green when it should probably be light blue. :P Or has he used it in the show and I don't remember?
<Sumica> 00,10impresive
<prince-dari> He has a straight edge?
<DerpyMuffins> You drew one line....
<Meanwhile> I'm more confused as to why the devs of this game didn't just make it a film.
<CriticKitten> Man.
<DerpyMuffins> That sure as hard
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: because they could?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah the cross bar at the bottem of the table
<mitamaking> How much did this game cost?
<prince-dari> Which he slid up
<cachi01|phone> Idk
<Dovah> hey ValtheJean am i allowed to post links to fics?
<CriticKitten> 60 bucks.
<prince-dari> To draw a straight line
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because the lizard trial isn't nearly as intense when you're watching instead of playing
<mitamaking> Way too much
<Buytoast> This film was probably ab out 60 bucks.
<Sumica> 00,10it's the old pully style kind
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no
<DerpyMuffins> What is this anyways?
<Dovah> k
<Sumica> 00,10only at the end dari
<cachi01|phone> But the creators of heavy rain also made Indigo prophecy
<Buytoast> Heavy Rain
<cowvarkian> halo 4
<cachi01|phone> (Fahrenheit)
<Buytoast> It's some show about a guy drawing without any tools.
<Sumica> 00,10what is with the stalker camera
<DaringDerpy> as interesting as watching paint dry
<Buytoast> And looking like a pothead on his daily fix.

<HappyCanary> Im sorry...but JASON IS AN IDIOT.
<SpeedyBolt> Like, landing on Concrete or something.

<Kinixys> Sumica: Maybe if he uses them too much he becomes addicted...
<DeadpoolDash> sweet, I got into the MechWarrior Online beta
<SpeedyBolt> This game is set in 2021
<Dken2021> CriticKitten government experiment
<DocSane> So, this is Minority Report: The Game, right?
<SpeedyBolt> Young people, meet your future.
<twilight_sprinkle> theyre 3d projectors it would seem
<cachi01|phone> Sumica he has to take some drugs due to the fucking glasses
<twilight_sprinkle> not outward projector
<VenHur> Under the seeea!
<CriticKitten> 'cuz this shit is just a BIT beyond real life present day tech. XD
<Meanwhile> "I know this, because I'm NAHRMAN JAYDEN"
<mitamaking|swings> Did that say blue?
<FillyFlam> ...I need those glasses.
<Jason> shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<CrimsonPhoenix> so I finished season 3 of DoctorWho....well the new series
<Lonko> Valve will make this a realityas
<FlareChaser> HEY
<FlareChaser> Flare.
<DocSane> Origami store?
<CriticKitten> Oh, those shades suck, they only get Yahoo Maps
<mitamaking|swings> That seems too easy
<SpeedyBolt> Origami Store.
<Meanwhile> Specialist store.
<cachi01|phone> Lonko valve and google
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt know they had origami stores
<Dken2021> Lonko I was thinking what google had might be a bit similar
<sonicdude558> Now this game is getting japanese
<SpeedyBolt> Actually
<VenHur> Gentlecolt, the i-Glasses.
<SpeedyBolt> Orahgahmee staws
<Lonko> Dken2021: Google is not sophisticated enough
<SpeedyBolt> Since he says things in a funny way
<DocSane> Google Goggles
<Lonko> Man, I would love to try Occolus Rift
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Pony: An Unexpected Journeigh
<CriticKitten> ....digital files....
<mitamaking|swings> I guess go to the origami store
<cachi01|phone> VenHur dude watch out with that I you might get sued
<Sumica> 00,10man this would be amusing to own
<SpeedyBolt> 9-13
<Dken2021> no one spoiled anything yet?
<twilight_sprinkle> imagine, if you had those glasses, you could be IN ponyville
<CriticKitten> Okay, I am just going to assume this guy is a nutter
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: :3
<SpeedyBolt> THANK GOD, I'M SAFE
<VenHur> DocSane: Those are actually real, I sawed a video of it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> the origami killer is a pedo
<FillyFlam> Nehthen.
<thelonepony> and Jason was 10...
<DocSane> VenHur: I know
<SpeedyBolt> Rain watuh
*sonicdude558 @prince-dari wow you're fast
<mitamaking|swings> Wait, why did they just now mention that they were young boys
<StinkomanFan> You know... he'd bee reading these things backward.
<CriticKitten> There's no way this is real tech, so yeah, I'm going with "he's batshit insane"
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps it's not a killer
<Dken2021> mitamaking|swings it will be explained later
<VenHur> DocSane: Don't know if it's real, but...yeah.
<Sumica> 00,10wait a jason to the murder?
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: hi
<Dken2021> CriticKitten it's from the government
<mitamaking|swings> I mean it fits, but why wait till now to tell the player
<CriticKitten> It's clearly Ethan. Not content with killing his own kids, he's killing other peoples' kids too,
<VenHur> Just...don't use the glasses in a library, driving a car, or trolling.
<twilight_sprinkle> id never leave ponyville if i had those glasses
<prince-dari> sonicdude558: Oh yeah, I sit here and refresh EQD every 10 seconds to check for a enw post
<prince-dari> new*
<sonicdude558> lol
<VenHur> Because trolling with those glasses makes it 20% uncool.
<Kinixys> The real killer can't be obvious.. there has to be a twist.
<twilight_sprinkle> sauspects
<Dken2021> prince-dari that's why we pay you for that
<CriticKitten> It also means that your cops have suspiciously consistent timing between the discovery of the body and their death
<cachi01|phone> we dont pay him....
<mitamaking|swings> I wonder if.... I might spoil if I am guessing right
<CriticKitten> Which would imply that it's a cop
<CriticKitten> >_>
<sonicdude558> Twilight Sparkle
<sonicdude558> ^^^^^^^^
<CriticKitten> But of course that's too logical.
<mitamaking|swings> White? Why does he have to be white?

<cachi01|phone> SpeedyBolt or you would have knoxked out the guy
<cachi01|phone> 9
<Dken2021> so yea, every event in this game changes the outcomeof the ending
<Hipster-Pony> little boys
<Kandarihu> To think, all those people who complain about violence in videogames. We keep telling them that it's the way video games have to be... and then THIS comes along!
<CriticKitten> And so you're giving this valuable evidence to a random man instead of, ya know, THE POLICE?
<SpeedyBolt> Thank you come again
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he didn't pay for the inhaler
<Freefall29> Kandarihu: what do you mean?
<Kinixys> hehe
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hes a PI

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: o u
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so dont ask me

<Dken2021> Freefall29 but it's pretty much a movie on it;s own
<cowvarkian> *you
<oni_link> DocSane: I believe so but its still sluggish. I think I still have some, there was a total of 12 files that were in my system and I managed to remove them, but i think now I have adware because certain key phrases become highlited in blue. But it looks like its my jobs website that has that problem.
<cachi01|phone> Freefall yes lionsgate will be doing it
<mitamaking|swings> :o
<SpeedyBolt> A certain person on this chat
<Freefall29> how can you make a movie out of a movie
<Klumzeedragon> mitamaking|swings: that's why it's probably about $10 now. :D

<mitamaking|swings> 10 dollars.... I may grab this
<Dken2021> ohai emangamer
<Freefall29> sup Nittany_Discord
<SpeedyBolt> If you can make a mountain out of a molehill, then its possible to make a movie out of a videogame movie
<emangamer> sup dk
<Meanwhile> If they make a movie out of this they're really just milking it, it's already got less actual gameplay than Pong.
<Nittany_Discord> Hi all.
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, pretty much the same way these anime studios can make an anime series out of a Visual Novel.
<cachi01|phone> the ps move version is 20 dollsrs
<mitamaking|swings> Who has ever made a moutain out of a molehill?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Nittany_Discord :)
<cowvarkian> or like making a movie remake
<oni_link> hi Nittany_Discord
<SpeedyBolt> Dat music

<cachi01|phone> Kandarihu school days
<Freefall29> mitamaking|swings: hollywood
<sonicdude558> dat brand radio
<Dken2021> I dunno about making this a movie, the charming part about this game was you have input, I'm not sure how this would translate to the big screen
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this chat is ded, it can't survive, it needs something to give it live
<mitamaking|swings> Volcano maybe?
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, Kanon, Clannad, Air
<VenHur> She must be thinking "Wait, why the hell would I go like this?"
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh i like how theres so many options to go with
<cachi01|phone> Clannad is a game? :o
<Freefall29> heavy rain: now with less press x and more cliches

<mitamaking|swings> Don't drink
<oni_link> whooo gettin tipsy
<LadyCanary> Errybody in the club getting tipsy
<Meanwhile> In order to actually live as a chat it'd need more people, but said people are only around here for the sake of avoiding movie night spam.
<Klumzeedragon> Classy. Right from the bottle. :D
<emangamer> ValtheJean: make her drink the bleach under the kitchen sink
<oni_link> haha nice LadyCanary :D
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, yeah. Air, Kanon, and Clannad were all based on VNs by Key/Visual Art
<sonicdude558> SHUT UP ORCHESTRA

<oni_link> That sink is something out of The Suffering, I swear
<twilight_sprinkle> almost called it
<Meanwhile> That music was real loud right there.
<SpeedyBolt> Open Fridge
<emangamer> Dken2021: probably
<Kandarihu> Alright. There's an intruder
<SpeedyBolt> Turn that damn music off.
<Freefall29> its just the beer getting to ya

<Ghost_Nappa> wtf?

<Dken2021> kick their ass!
<Freefall29> what happens if you lose
<SpeedyBolt> ...3 I think
<mitamaking|swings> Finally in bed

<twilight_sprinkle> -_-
<SpeedyBolt> So there were 3...or what?
<Kandarihu> There was a ... it was a dream
<LadyCanary> ...For the love of OH GOD.
<CriticKitten> Well that was pointless, thanks!
<FillyFlam> ...v.v
<cowvarkian> ...
<oni_link> So this is Heavy Rain? pretty good :3
<Dken2021> dang insomnia
<Meanwhile> So...where was the point in that?
<mitamaking|swings> :\
<Jason> it was all for nothing! LOLOLOLOL
<Buytoast> well that was severly anticlimactic
<CriticKitten> There was no point.
<Meanwhile> There wasn't any, was there.
<SpeedyBolt> No point
<DocSane> Press X to not die
<twilight_sprinkle> the entire game is a dream!
<Meanwhile> That was literally pointless.
<CriticKitten> That was basically a waste of our time/
<zerograv5> ...no point
<Ghost_Nappa> ppl play skylanders
<Freefall29> how long did that scene last
<SpeedyBolt> I think it was just explaining.
<WildRepublicGuard> thank u dreams
<emangamer> DocSane: quit quoting ZP
<sonicdude558> No wonder the time was 88:88
<FillyFlam> Wow, it almost fooled me into thinking there was a point for a minute.
<Reikim> Dead?
<oni_link> I can see why the PS3 kids were raving on about this :P
<Freefall29> 20 minutes?
<SpeedyBolt> Quite a while.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile scare the Sh*t out of you ?
<mitamaking|swings> Well she got sleep
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact im dreaming of all of you right now
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That wasn't scary.
<Reikim> Evening,a ll.
<Reikim> *all
<Dken2021> Meanwhile I think to tell you that you're gonna expect more complex button pushing
<DocSane> emangamer: Well, he has a point.
<Meanwhile> Allo Reikim.
<mitamaking|swings> twilight_sprinkle: But I am dreaming you
<Dken2021> hai Reikim
<Meanwhile> Mhmm.
<Reikim> What are you guys watching?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile so you don't know when things actually affect what you are doing ...
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking|swings: not unless i dreamt you first!
<sonicdude558> Heavy Rain
<DocSane> emangamer: This game is nothing but Press X to Not Die
<Freefall29> Reikim: heavy rain. the game of press x to win
<sonicdude558> Also it isn't a movie
<SpeedyBolt> Yo Ethan...
<VenHur> What if Bronystate was a dream all this time?! *wakes up* ...Nope...
<SpeedyBolt> You alright?
<WildRepublicGuard> twilight_sprinkle: O///O
<mitamaking|swings> Stop with the archetecture
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: How is that a good point to make? "By the way you may be totally irrelevant"
<Dken2021> poor ethan, that beard of sorrow looks horrible on him
*PillowPoni|Minecraft slaps VenHur "Don't you say that!"
<Ghost_Nappa> gimme a tardis!
<sonicdude558> Can the orchestra shut up for once?
<emangamer> DocSane: doesnt mean you should get laughs off of other's jokes
<Freefall29> what if this whole game is a dream
<mitamaking|swings> What if ponies was just a dream
<Meanwhile> Actually that's not bad, might make it more like a movie, now if they'd just take the actions out...
<Ghost_Nappa> god this is boring
<SpeedyBolt> Then i would never wake up
<twilight_sprinkle> Emo chronicles, part 2. Thanks again for subscribing, have a nice day!
<sonicdude558> I had a dream about ponies once
<Freefall29> if ponies were a dream. it was the greatest dream ever
<Dovah> Ghost_Nappa: Do NOT complain about the stream damnit!
<Dken2021> hey gang, a clue
<WildRepublicGuard> oh god, ghost nappa
<Reikim> From what I'm reading, this game qualifies as "Existentialism: The Game".
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look, a collectible!!!!
<DocSane> emangamer: That's not a joke. That's me making commentary by quoting another.
<CriticKitten> Uh....foreshadowing? Symbolism? Stupid pointless bullshit?
<CriticKitten> YOU DECIDE :D
<VenHur> Freefall29: Don't say such a thing!
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: yes
<Bronysith> oh hey there Reikim whats going on?
<SpeedyBolt> I cant say, without the risk of getting banned.
<SpeedyBolt> Sorry guys :p
<Freefall29> SpeedyBolt: da heck you talking about
<mitamaking|swings> Why would Shaun jsut get left there
<emangamer> alright, I'm off for another 3 weeks
<SpeedyBolt> >3 weeks
<Reikim> Bronysith: Nothing much. Trying vaguely to write badass ponies, but I'm not sure if my heart is in it. It's a bit hard getting the ball rolling.
<SpeedyBolt> wat
<emangamer> see you people later
<Yahooz> emangamer!!!!
<Ghost_Nappa> 3 weeks?
<Yahooz> DUDE
<Yahooz> WHEREVE YOU BEEN 0_o
<oni_link> wow, later emangamer . Take care
<Dken2021> seeya then emangamer, or not, the choice is yours
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile since everything is due to your choices or lack of them yeah it makes a point if you think something is irrelevant
*emangamer walks our right as Yahooz calls his name
<Bronysith> Reikim: but once it rolls it wont stop
<Rustymeat> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
<SpeedyBolt> Just wait, jeez.
<mitamaking|swings> Fail at getting up?
<CriticKitten> He's got a golden ticket~
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: My point is that that's not helpful. A choice is meaningless if you can't properly judge how it's going to turn out.
<Dken2021> this town is always raining
<emangamer> like a boss
<SpeedyBolt> HELLO, POLICE
<oni_link> lol
<Yahooz> hows VT
<Meanwhile> Left or right? Oh doesn't matter there's a fucking open man hole cover on both routes.
<My_Hairy_Aunt> What dafuq!!! D: Gears 3 lags so much!!!!!!! :[
<emangamer> Yahooz: pretty damn good ^_^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and no reporter notices it ?
<mitamaking|swings> ha paparazi got served
<Ghost_Nappa> dis is weerd
<Ponies47> Sheesh you go to play TF2 and all they want to do is not kill each other. -_-
<emangamer> Yahooz: but seriously, class tomorrow at 8 I gotta go man
<MASF123> See you emangamer
<oni_link> MASF123: that sucks
<Ghost_Nappa> weeping angel?
<Ponies47> They we're about to kick me from the server D:
<Yahooz> emangamer: alright
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile uhmm makes sense
<Dken2021> oh dear, not this
<Yahooz> laters
<zerograv5> crowd fear activate
<mitamaking|swings> oh no
<emangamer> deuces
<Ghost_Nappa> i saw a weeping angel
<MASF123> WHat sucks oni_link?
<Bronysith> oh hey there TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<SpeedyBolt> Woah...

<cowvarkian> do tell
<Dken2021> btw, he has a fear of crowds
<CriticKitten> What?
<Ghost_Nappa> bai
<mitamaking|swings> Dken2021: I wonder why...
<SpeedyBolt> Oh come on!
<oni_link> MASF123: you said gears was lagging
<MASF123> That wasn't me. :/
<VenHur> Come on, you can make it!
<Dken2021> then this happens....
<CriticKitten> Fear of crowds? What a wonderful plot contrivance, I mean character point!
<SpeedyBolt> Great job, Ethan.
<MASF123> I'll be back, I have to go again, I have to shower now.
<mitamaking|swings> huh
<SpeedyBolt> You broke EVERYTHING
<Jason> YOU KILLED HIM!
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<SpeedyBolt> lolded
<oni_link> Whats happening to him, I look away and its tripping me out O,O
<cowvarkian> that too CriticKitten
<SpeedyBolt> Oh god what
<Jason> dad....
<Rustymeat> JASON!?
<sonicdude558> What the hell?
<Meanwhile> JASON.
<WildRepublicGuard> da fuck?
<Meanwhile> Here we go again right?
<thelonepony> JASON!
<mitamaking|swings> JASON!!!
<cowvarkian> well this is strange
<SpeedyBolt> That voice is scary
<Buytoast> you kiiiiiled me faaaatheeeeeer.
<CriticKitten> JASON
<Dken2021> oh boy, pressing x to jason...again
<VenHur> Everything freezed!
<Meanwhile> Yup.

<Meanwhile> JAAASON
<SpeedyBolt> Just knock down everybody.
<FillyFlam> Jaaaaason!

<Hipster-Pony> JAAAAAASSSSSSSOOOONNNN
<zerograv5> JASON!
<cowvarkian> yay, ragdoll
<Hipster-Pony> fuck you guys
*Meanwhile everyone just flumps to the floor like sacks of flour...
<Dken2021> there's an achivement for knocking down the people btw
<SpeedyBolt> This brings new meaning to "killing everything you touch"
<MASF123|afk> Hi SuperSteak64.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: dat flump
<Buytoast> shit he vanished
<Buytoast> he must be a spooker
<VenHur> It's like a game of dominoes!
<DerpyMuffins> You are killing so many people
<FillyFlam> daaaaAAAAAAd
<mitamaking|swings> Man why is the voice acting in this game so bad
<SpeedyBolt> That voice creepsd me out...
<Dken2021> this was very odd, it's like he's in superspeed or something
<Meanwhile> Erryday ahm flumpin.
<CriticKitten> Dad! My character was poorly written, dad!
<oni_link> Meanwhile: LD
<oni_link> *:D
<SpeedyBolt> Okay, seriously
<oni_link> derp
<SpeedyBolt> What the hell is wrong with these people?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: lol'd.
<RoboGerbil> wtf are we watching?
<Rustymeat> how convienent
<Dken2021> SpeedyBolt good ol' human error
<SpeedyBolt> Is everybody in this game just...not paying attention to a man wandering randomly off?
<mitamaking|swings> That works
<oni_link> RoboGerbil: apparantly Heavy Rain
<WildRepublicGuard> thats one way to get though a crowd
<cachi01|phone> RoboGerbil one.of my fave games
<cowvarkian> SpeedyBolt: yes
<cachi01|phone> RoboGerbil heavy rain
*sonicdude558 A overly realistic film, RoboGerbil
<RoboGerbil> cachi01|phone: wow.. you need to play some better games
<cowvarkian> RoboGerbil: seriously
<cachi01|phone> RoboGerbil example?
<Dken2021> what's wrong with this?
<mitamaking|swings> In it is.... a HEAD
<cowvarkian> cachi01|phone: just about anything else
<WildRepublicGuard> OH MY GOD A BOX!
<CriticKitten> A baux. :o
<zerograv5> ooo, a box
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian this game is good and you should feel bad
<mitamaking|swings> We know what is in the box, we saw one earlier
<Rustymeat> WHats in the box? :3
<cowvarkian> cachi01|phone: um... no
<cachi01|phone> yes
<cowvarkian> no
<VenHur> It's a box inside a box inside another box!
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<RoboGerbil> its a box full of guts
<Meanwhile> Boxception.
<cowvarkian> nei
<Dken2021> I wonder if it's a embarassing photo of a sea sponge at a christmas party
<cachi01|phone> Oui
<WildRepublicGuard> :D
<cowvarkian> ni
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: now shit gets real
<cachi01|phone> Si
<mitamaking|swings> Dken2021: :)
<cowvarkian> nein
<LadyCanary> Ah, the box.
<Ponies47> brb
<Meanwhile> Here's a gun and some other shit. Enjoy.
<cachi01|phone> Dken2021 dat reference lol
<mitamaking|swings> A gun?
<Bronysith> these are the boxes i usually give to people
<oni_link> This game looks good IMO but I was never a fan of these types of games. I still woudn't go out and buy a ps3 for it, MGS4 is a more compelling argument . But at the same time, this generation's consoles are coming to an end since the new ones are approaching
<Dken2021> thus begins the trial of torture
<cowvarkian> no habla engles
<cowvarkian> <,<
<RoboGerbil> bored now, gonna go play new vegas
<oni_link> Hi Pinkies4thWall
<cowvarkian> good luck with that
<mitamaking|swings> oni_link: You can get them cheaper now, MGS and some 3rd party games if you don't own a 360 are good enough
<cachi01|phone> I just bought a xbox 360 so screw you xbox 8
<MASF123|afk> Hi Pinkies5thWall
<MASF123|afk> Pinkies4thWall
<Dken2021> hey Pinkies4thWall
<cowvarkian> cachi01|phone: xbox 8?
<CriticKitten> Dad! My acting has somehow gotten worse! Dad!
<SpeedyBolt> Not dar.
<SpeedyBolt> *far
<SpeedyBolt> Not far at all
<LadyCanary> ...Sweet jesus D:
<cachi01|phone> hi pinkies4thwall
<FillyFlam> Daaaaaad, I'm acting daaaad.
<Meanwhile> You're killing me CriticKitten
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: how far would you go to save your loved one?
<mitamaking|swings> Oh wow
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian thts the name of the 720
<LadyCanary> Perfect, CriticKitten TT_TT
<mitamaking|swings> Why only test him?
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian well. Its xbox.infinite
<Dken2021> yea, the child VAs kinda suck
<oni_link> mitamaking|swings: I have a 360 but I want to invest in a gaming PC and also the Wii U. Not so sure about the next Xbox or Playstation to be honest
<MASF123|afk> I would kill myself to save a pony's life.
<SpeedyBolt> I'd do anything to save a friends life.
<Dken2021> yay this guy
<SpeedyBolt> Other than them, I could care less for humanity.
<SpeedyBolt> The killer is white.
<CriticKitten> How do you know that?
<MASF123|afk> Screw humanity IMO.
<cowvarkian> cachi01|phone: so, are these still just baseless rumours, or do you actually have a source
<oni_link> SpeedyBolt: me too
<SpeedyBolt> Because hes white
<mitamaking|swings> oni_link: Depending on what gets announced tomorrow the Wii U may be worth waiting a year for
<CriticKitten> ....wat
<Ponies47> back
<mitamaking|swings> Why does he have to be white?
<MASF123|afk> "He'll believe anything I saw because I'm white."
<MASF123|afk> say
<SpeedyBolt> Because racial diffusion.
<CriticKitten> mitamaking: Because the science said so
<Nittany_Discord> Not really dead. Just slow.
<CriticKitten> And you can't doubt the science.
<CriticKitten> And you know this because....?
<oni_link> mitamaking|swings: I don't think it will have strong launch titles but Im thinking long term. Nintendo always has me coming back for thier first party games
*sonicdude558 mitamaking|swings Where is this going to be announced? I am interested
<mitamaking|swings> Only in.......... HEAVY RAIN?
<Meanwhile> So slow it looks dead. So...comatose.
<twilight_sprinkle> yay, the rain has a purpose now
<mitamaking|swings> sonicdude558: Tomorrow 10 am, a Nintendo press conference, look at Kotaku or IGN
<Dken2021> and it strange that the rain is very long
<sonicdude558> okie dokie lokie
<SpeedyBolt> Yes
<MASF123|afk> WHat the jiggle-whats is Kotuku?
<Rustymeat> Blake go eat a dick
<CriticKitten> ....what are you, an asshat? Ten square miles is a hell of a lot better than you've done so far.
<SpeedyBolt> LOL
<SpeedyBolt> THAT GU
<SpeedyBolt> That guy was so UGLY
<oni_link> MASF123|afk: a gaming news website
<MASF123|afk> Blake, go eat a Rustymeat.
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian uhmm ign lol
<Buytoast> Kotaku is a crappy online game magizine that knows nothing about video games.
<Dken2021> oni_link a very slow game news site
<CriticKitten> Thanks for your meaningful contribution, Blake
<Rustymeat> damn he angry
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<MASF123|afk> Buytoast, oh.
<SpeedyBolt> Abso-fucking-lutely
<mitamaking|swings> Go For Him!
<FillyFlam> absofuckinlutely
<cachi01|phone> cowvarkian and i think Microsoft confirmed it
<Meanwhile> Absofuckinglutely.
<Kinixys> Blake feels threatened.
<cowvarkian> cachi01|phone: they havent
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: thats ur catchphrase
<oni_link> Dken2021: true, google is my freind when it comes to that :D
<CriticKitten> "We should DO something!" "Should we DO something?"
<twilight_sprinkle> boss is enjoying the show
<Meanwhile> Blake be all mad.
<Jason> YOUR TRASHING MY SCENE!!!
<Reikim> Rage?
<LadyCanary> Look ma! Im acting!
<CriticKitten> I'M FED UP WITH DIS WERLD

<Big_Macintosh_1992> FRIDGE
<Klumzeedragon> So since it's a page it's not good? Fair enough.
<CriticKitten> I love how this guy's fridge has the word "FRIDGE" pasted on it in giant letters so he doesn't forget what it's for
*Dovah is checking rules
<mitamaking|Crossroad> Thought someone was behind him
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Non image links are only allowed when there isn't a stream on.
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: people seem to not give any fucks over it
<Meanwhile> If they don't they get a boot to the head cowvarkian.
<Dovah> yup its non-image, thought it was just video
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: >.> I've never seen it happen over anything that wasnt a video
<DeadpoolDash> don't cross the streams
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Well, i'm done for the night... Quick question before I go: Anyone here going to Anime Detour in April?
<CriticKitten> Uh, music, if you wanna be dramatic that's fine but would you mind toning it down a bit so we can hear the dialogue?
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: Well usually only pics or videos are linked, not much reason to link sites.
<Klumzeedragon> Like the one on his desk!?
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: well, whenever it happens, I havent ever seen much repurcussion for it
<mitamaking|Crossroad> That menu is wet
<SpeedyBolt> I like that Pause Screen
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: Usually because it only takes a warning to knock people into line.
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Meanwhile> Slow him down more than his asthma
<CriticKitten> "You'll just slow me down" says the asthmatic fat PI
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: I've never gotten a warning for it >.>
<Meanwhile> cowvarkian: You've probably never done it.

<cowvarkian> I probably will, but whatever
<AJIsAwesome> Big_Macintosh_1992: night :)

<shibaru> I saw that Shulk was going to need to go to work in 2 hours so I went over to him to make sure he was ready and I found him sleeping in the air...
<Cypresswolf> Thats the only way to drink whiskey
<SpeedyBolt> He doesnt care for guests
<Klumzeedragon> cowvarkian: Then you are a trooper. I can only tolerate cause of Friendship is Witchcraft.
<CriticKitten> Why does everyone talk to themselves?

<Meanwhile> He's doing pretty well now...
<Meanwhile> For a fat asthmatic.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: or a skinny asthmatic
<DarkStratos> and a guy laughing in backround, take it thats the player?
<Klumzeedragon> I thought you didnt like when the fat man could do so much Val. :D
<SpeedyBolt> Meanwhile: You'd be suprised on the qualities of people
<shizu[mobile]> hm
<Bronysith> GNIGHT you crazy bastards

<SpeedyBolt> Hope you have fun, Val
<JESmith71> Welcome back DarkStratos
<DarkStratos> JESmith71: heh thank you
<thelonepony> wb DarkStratos :)
<Meanwhile> Val were you going to finish the game in one sitting or continue at a later date?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on a) how far I get, and b) whether someone else queues up behind me
<JusticeKoro> Is it ever not raining in this game?
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<SpeedyBolt> It wasnt in the Prologue.
<nerf_soldier> how many trials has val done so far?
<SpeedyBolt> Isnt this the 2nd?
<Klumzeedragon> ValtheJean: How close are you to being done? It seems like you're pretty damn far in. :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Press X to jason
<JESmith71> JusticeKoro: Well the game's title * is* Heavy Rain,
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<DarkStratos> ok so is the person streaming chat always highlighted like that or is it because he is a mod or something
<SpeedyBolt> It's Light Sprinkle, guys.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm a mod
<DerpyMuffins> Electric plant doesnt even use electric fense?
<Reikim> So I looked this game up. Apparently it's one of those asshole games that makes you do horrible things. I like it.
<JESmith71> DarkStratos: Yep all mods have colored text
<ValtheJean> 2,14 notice the @ in front of my name
<cachi01|phone> oh hey. Its the task i never completed
<DerpyMuffins> I always thought it ment Admin
<cachi01|phone> Fucking butterfly
<DarkStratos> ah so that signifies a mod?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeedyBolt: light me?
<AJIsAwesome> yep
<JusticeKoro> Doesn't mean it has to be raining the entire time. MLP has more than just ponies, after all
<DarkStratos> ok then good to know
<Klumzeedragon> DarkStratos: All mods have a different colour text. :) And only mods can stream.
<shizu[mobile]> rain rain was here? :<
<nerf_soldier> isn't Phase4 a mod too?
<Reikim> PRESS X TO TURN THE WHEEL
<Phase4> 00,02nerf_soldier, nope

<shizu[mobile]> it means he's special
<DerpyMuffins> He is just stupid now

<SpeedyBolt> lol
<shizu[mobile]> "special"
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Mm, missed her a while ago.
<Reikim> So is that...what...a crematorium oven?
<Nittany_Discord> Night.
<Buytoast> oh boy, now it's getting all Saw 2 up in here
<DarkStratos> what the heck is he in?
<nerf_soldier> Phase4: oh well okay then
<Reikim> Oh look a shizu! Only...not quite!
<DerpyMuffins> Furnice
<Rustymeat> Oh great
<shizu[mobile]> hello from linux mint on mah laptop
<JESmith71> ...although sometime the mods sometimes don't put their colors on sometimes
<Meanwhile> Lovely.
<Reikim> >Psychopath leads you to furnace >Climb inside furnace
<twilight_sprinkle> thats very slow
<cachi01|phone> OR JUST FUCKING REMOVE THEN SLOWLY
<CriticKitten> So the Origami Killer is just Jigsaw?
<Reikim> SO GENIUS
<CriticKitten> That's not much of a relevation
<SpeedyBolt> Wouldnt work.
<Cypresswolf> dont brush the glass aside or anything
<DarkStratos> thats enough freaking glass in there
<SpeedyBolt> Ethan is too fat.
<Rustymeat> jesus
<cachi01|phone> CriticKitten kinda
<Reikim> Also: he's wearing a leather freaking jacket. Doesn't that impart SOME preotection?
<DarkStratos> ooh sparks
<Meanwhile> Apparently Origami raided a bottlebank.
<Rustymeat> tghats alota glass
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<Klumzeedragon> Isnt that a leather jacket? :S Should be thick enough to pretect from glass.
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03dat glass~
<SpeedyBolt> As he described, the glass is as sharp as a razor
<LadyCanary> ...Ow.
<cachi01|phone> SpeedyBolt he could just move the glass to the right and then crawl without the paim
<cachi01|phone> Pain
<SpeedyBolt> He is fat.
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <3
<SpeedyBolt> There is no way.
<DerpyMuffins> When did this turn into Saw?
<DarkStratos> I keep expecting a fireball to start behind him..
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<Meanwhile> The postit.
<Klumzeedragon> Glass can only get so sharp in those big of chunks. :D
<DarkStratos> and this is gonna end with him having no more matchs and having to random guess..
<SpeedyBolt> He stocked up on WAY TOO MANY Strawberry Chewies.
<DerpyMuffins> Yea light a match in a furnice
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Reikim> Isn't the glass lying flat?
<Stallion_of_War> When a mommy broken glass and a daddy broken glass love each other VERY much.
<cachi01|phone> Fucking giant furnace
<Meanwhile> It'd be lying flat if it was window pane glass
<DarkStratos> looks like it
<Reikim> LIGHT
<VenHur> COME ON ALMOST THERE!
<Meanwhile> I'd have to assume to get that much it'd need to be bottles or something, which have a natural curve.
<DarkStratos> doesnt this guy have broken ribs also..
<DarkStratos> and a head injury
<cachi01|phone> LOL TROLOLOLOLOLOL
<Reikim> True enough. But it looks like pane glass.
<CriticKitten> You'll be fine.
<Rustymeat> Ewwwww
<CriticKitten> Walk it off.
<DarkStratos> lol MORE holes!
<Stallion_of_War> Glass breeds like rabbits
<nerf_soldier> ooo, a slide!
<Klumzeedragon> What, are there scorpions in this one?
<DarkStratos> now whats in here?

<Stallion_of_War> Roll over on your glass shard ridden knees, sure...
<SpeedyBolt> ROLLERCOASTER
<LadyCanary> Whee~
<SpeedyBolt> WEEE
<Meanwhile> In this next one the glass is on fire.
<DarkStratos> scorpions? thast would suck..
<DarkStratos> oh, thought he was going into barbwire
<SpeedyBolt> wait...
<cachi01|phone> This is the part when i fucked up
<Reikim> Meanwhile...are you serious?
<Stallion_of_War> Thank goodness there were no 90 degree angles
<SpeedyBolt> Woah
<Klumzeedragon> :D A tunnel of thumb tacs!
<SpeedyBolt> The Killer can NOT be serious about this
<Meanwhile> Reikim: No. It's electricity, that'd be too silly.
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03cachi01|phone: NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
<DerpyMuffins> Is this a game based on Saw?
<DarkStratos> TESLA COILS! fun for all!
<Reikim> DerpyMuffins: Not at all.
<VenHur> No, this is Heavy Rain...
<DerpyMuffins> Seems like it
<Meanwhile> Quick, walk into it.
<cachi01|phone> NAHMAN_JAYDEN ONICHAN
<AJIsAwesome> NAHMAN_JAYDEN: Onii-chan

<JRPhone> SuperBrony64:

<Stallion_of_War> Well, we're boned
<VenHur> He's all like "Welp, i'm screwed."
<DarkStratos> couldnt he like climb the generators,
<cachi01|phone> After 4 strikes ethan gives up
<DarkStratos> he wouldnt be grounded
<flutterchu> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb2y1mEVT71qbrk9eo1_r2_500.jpg dis always makes me cry :'(
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<SpeedyBolt> He couldnt.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: He has a lot of spare time.
<LadyCanary> ...Oh god how horrifying
<SpeedyBolt> You may not notice it, but there are rows.
<Klumzeedragon> Take you jacket off... And I don't know. Pull some wires..
<SpeedyBolt> If he screwed up ONE jump...yeah.
<cachi01|phone> flutterchu so thats why the series is now all shitty
<cachi01|phone> :(
<twilight_sprinkle> DarkStratos: even without being grounded, he he still has a lower potential than the coil or w.e., so hed get shocked
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Opinions. :P
<DarkStratos> twilight_sprinkle: true, true.
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03lik dis if u cry evertim
<SpeedyBolt> Besides
<SpeedyBolt> That is some intense electricity]

<LadyCanary> Imma crey 5ever, NAHMAN_JAYDEN
<cachi01|phone> Caramel just to warn you. If u fail 4 times ethan will give up and.will.lose this challenge
<DarkStratos> why didn't the origami killer make it into a MAZE TOO!
*Klumzeedragon I'll lik dat NAHMAN_JAYDEN,

<cachi01|phone> Dabuq
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03I wanna be ur HUSBAND! Ohhh...
<SpeedyBolt> Imagine your closest friend got kidnapped
<SpeedyBolt> and you had to go through this to save him/her
<Posey> ..................
<SpeedyBolt> Would you do it?
<DarkStratos> no
<DarkStratos> lol
<Rustymeat> This Fish has best electric brain http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/0/4/2/3042.jpg?v=1
<Cades> haha
<DarkStratos> I would hire this guy to do it
<Stallion_of_War> Why can't this game be chocolate rain?
<SpeedyBolt> I honestly would.
<Cades> btw sorry i havent been talking much, im still doing homework -_-
<SpeedyBolt> Woah
<AJIsAwesome> I actually would, IMO.
<SpeedyBolt> He...actually dod it.
<Klumzeedragon> Rustymeat: Eat it?
<SpeedyBolt> *did
<DarkStratos> so wait what is the plot of this game?
<cachi01|phone> Wow nice one Caramel
<WildRepublicGuard> so ninja
<AJIsAwesome> SO PARKOUR!
<SpeedyBolt> A kid dies, and then his other kid gets kidnapped.
<cachi01|phone> DarkStratos they kidnap your son
<VenHur> He made it!
<DarkStratos> ah ok
<SpeedyBolt> Basically, this guy here has to do shit to save his son
<JESmith71> Oh BTW DarkStratos there is one rule you should know. Remember how it said in the rules no talking about spoilers? Well that rule is enforced for anything regarding Season 3. Like if a plot devlopment or song gets revealed we can't talk about or speculate about it here until the episode airs. This is done to respect the people in chat who don't want to know a thing about Season 3
<DarkStratos> mmk
<cachi01|phone> Dat succes.song
<Stallion_of_War> But I think it's safe to say that season 3 will be the third season though
<SpeedyBolt> Madison!
<Stallion_of_War> That shouldn't spoil things too much.
<AJIsAwesome> CUE FNAL FANTASY VICTORY MUSIC
<DarkStratos> lol..
<SpeedyBolt> Season 3 is third season.
<DerpyMuffins> There is a season 3?
<VenHur> Back to the hot chick again.

<DerpyMuffins> Im still on season 2
<AJIsAwesome> *FINAL*
<Wirisme> I'm back and I'm still awake.
<Reikim> So...I'm back. Who's this girl?
<Wirisme> Hey everyone
<Reikim> Did Val die?
<Wirisme> What are we watching?
<Kinixys> Hope season 3 is best season.
<SpeedyBolt> Madison, Reikim
<VenHur> Hi Wirisme!
<cachi01|phone> Reikim nope
<DarkStratos> so ya you like switch perspectives between 3 people?
<flutterchu> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/343/d/d/r_i_p_takeshi_shudo_by_bluehawk15-d34j8r6.png
<SpeedyBolt> Oh your god
<thelonepony> wb Wirisme
<Meanwhile> Well, you look like shit.
<VenHur> All seasons ARE best seasons, hoofs down.
<Reikim> DarkStratos: Four, according to the Tropes page.
<Reikim> PRESS X TO LIFT THE BODY
<DarkStratos> lol..
<DerpyMuffins> Triangle
<SpeedyBolt> Hold Up to lift Ethan
<Meanwhile> Press X to steal his wallet.
<DarkStratos> So wait why did he have to drive in the rain?
<flutterchu> dis iz no time to laugh for me takshi's death aniversary iz on the 29th :'(
<SpeedyBolt> The sad thing is...
<Stallion_of_War> Tap O repeatedly to make babbies?
<Wirisme> suddenly 1st person
<DarkStratos> LOL
<SpeedyBolt> I know a guy at my school who looks like the Ethan here.
<Reikim> PACE WANTONLY, IT'LL HELP
<Meanwhile> flutterchu it'd be easier to take you seriously if you didn't talk like a wally.
<SpeedyBolt> and his name IS actually Ethan.
<cachi01|phone> Sounds like he died in a pianful way :(
<Reikim> ...A wally?
<cachi01|phone> On October 28, 2010, Shudo suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the smoking area of the Kansai Main Line's Nara Station at around 6:00 AM
<Kinixys> VenHur: Well some episodes are awesome and some are epic, so I'm just hoping for more epic episodes.
<DarkStratos> like sonic rainboom..
<DarkStratos> or lesson zero
<Reikim> cachi01|phone: Who?
<DarkStratos> those are my 2 favs
<SpeedyBolt> Oh that is a lie.
<AJIsAwesome> Hoping for more adventure episodes. :$
<cachi01|phone> takeshi shudo Reikim
<SpeedyBolt> Girl, you know you want to see him shirtless.
<Reikim> Who's that?
<cachi01|phone> Writer of pokemon
<Reikim> Ah
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Wally. Dingbat. Melon. Gimboid. Halftop. No-noggin. Emptyhead.
<cachi01|phone> Back when it was good
<DerpyMuffins> Where is Reikim
<Reikim> I'm here
<Reikim> Not done yet, sorry DM.
<Kinixys> She's disinfecting again...
<DarkStratos> back to the medicine cabinet for more FREE drugs!
<SpeedyBolt> Take ALL the pills
<Kinixys> Wipe it out!
<Kinixys> One for you; two for me.
<DarkStratos> lol...
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<DerpyMuffins> Well I sent you a draft of my 4th capter Reikim
<twilight_sprinkle> deja vu!
<CriticKitten> Uh
<DarkStratos> why do i find these chats hilarious
<SpeedyBolt> She missed a spot
<SpeedyBolt> All near his upper arm
<Reikim> DerpyMuffins: Thanks, I'll take a look at it when I'm done with the others.
<DerpyMuffins> Dat dejavu
<CriticKitten> That's clearly not a wound you can just ignore.
<CriticKitten> Take him to a hospital.
<cachi01|phone> DarkStratos cause it is lol :)
<SpeedyBolt> This whore is not a doctor at all.
<DarkStratos> cachi01|phone: lol yep i guess so
<DarkStratos> HA
<DarkStratos> fail
<SpeedyBolt> Yeah, Madison.
<cachi01|phone> GENIUUUUS
<twilight_sprinkle> wow lol
<Meanwhile> Nice going lady.
<Reikim> But think of the QUESTIONS, CK! Also that would involve logic.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, that IS kind of stupid
<Reikim> Wouldn't there be glass in those wounds?
<DarkStratos> she should have read labels like the first time she raided his cabinet..
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma9p8i1WsB1rywedzo1_400.jpg
<Wirisme> Whoopsy :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: naw, watcha talkin bout willis?
<SpeedyBolt> She doesnt sound too worried.
<SpeedyBolt> "Oh...he's unconscious"
<DarkStratos> ha
<SpeedyBolt> "oh well."
<DarkStratos> "time to go make some dinner"
<LadyCanary> Jeez, the Persona 3 protaganist has more emotion than her.
<Meanwhile> "Hmm, I wonder what's for dinner."
<Reikim> I seem to remember you should first wash it out with water, THEN do the disinfectant, then bandage it, then call freaking 9-11 if you haven't already because that's not going to heal nicely without, yknow, proper medical treatment.
<Reikim> Also: ignore the knees, that'll help so much.
<flutterchu> http://derpy.me/idrewthisonetime :'(
<SpeedyBolt> What do you think?
<Reikim> No chance of infection there, none at all!
<LadyCanary> Night all~ have a good day/night~
<DarkStratos> she doesnt have enough forwardness to strip his pants
<thelonepony> fluterchu :'(
<Wirisme> <_<
<AJIsAwesome> LadyCanary: Night! :)
<SpeedyBolt> He just crawled through glass and electricity
<Reikim> Seriously, she completely ignored the knees.
<SpeedyBolt> He's TOTALLY fine
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Don't be silly! That's what disinfectant is for.
<Kinixys> g'night LadyCanary.
<cachi01|phone> flutterchu poor cubone :(
<thelonepony> night LadyCanary :)
<Reikim> Meanwhile: She didn't even so much as LOOK at the knees.
<DarkStratos> night LadyCanary
<cachi01|phone> Night Ladycanary
<Reikim> And she only did one arm
<Meanwhile> Next up, Ethan has to stick his arm through a scalding steam jet...
<DarkStratos> ...really?
<Cades> lol wtfs going on :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night LadyCanary
<Meanwhile> No. But that'd be funny wouldn't it.
<Wirisme> She sounds surprisingly well rested
<DarkStratos> Would be disturbing
<Reikim> Heavy Rain: Ethan Injures His Arm
<DarkStratos> so im going to trust you
<SpeedyBolt> Translation: Shut up.
<DarkStratos> I DONT ACCEPT YOUR ADVANCES
<Reikim> NO ONE CAN HELP ME
<cachi01|phone> Translation gtfo
<Reikim> I AM BEYOND YOUR HELP, FEMALE
<DarkStratos> so hilarious..
<Reikim> NOW SLOWLY BECOME CLOSER TO ME SO YOU CAN HEAL ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY
<CriticKitten> I wanna play a game
<DarkStratos> you get to CHOP YOUR HANDS OFF
<JusticeKoro> Are you a bad enough dude to save your son?
<VenHur> Translation: I'm Batman. I works alone. Now get out, woman.
<Meanwhile> I dunno, she might've thought to take the jacket off ball it up over her hands and use that to get through the glass.
<SpeedyBolt> Meanwhile, at the Eff Bee aih
<cachi01|phone> DarkStratos close.. .
<DarkStratos> cachi01|phone: oh boy..
<shibaru> He's sleeping on the air
<Reikim> Meanwhile: But that requires common sense.
<shibaru> I didn't evern move him out of the bed wtf XD
<Meanwhile> Reikim: True, and Ethan let both of his kids wander off and get killed, so we've decided already that he has the mental ability of wet cement.
<SpeedyBolt> Wait

<Klumzeedragon> This is the part that made this game super famous right?
<SpeedyBolt> Yup.
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Yep.
<cachi01|phone> Eeyup
<DarkStratos> oh boy..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thank you

<Kinixys> _/)_(\
<Klumzeedragon> Picks up one specific lizard which happened to have the key in it. :P
<cachi01|phone> Annnd its fucking pain time
<Polydunami> This should be interesting...
<DarkStratos> looks like a fire got hold of it
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid nosebleed .:|
<SpeedyBolt> No.
<Kinixys> -_(\
<DarkStratos> OH GOD
<cachi01|phone> DarkStratos remember what you said about cutting his hand? Well you were.close....
<oni_link> wtf :o
<Meanwhile> Sucks to be Ethan right now.
<SpeedyBolt> ...Yup.
<Reikim> Would you do this?

<oni_link> D:
<VenHur> C-Cut off his finger?! HELL NAW!
<cachi01|phone> For shauns sake...
<HoodyNinja> This is STILL playing?
<CriticKitten> Anyone else notice he says the same shit every single time?
<HoodyNinja> Hello bronystate!
<SpeedyBolt> Yup.
<Meanwhile> You ever tried to cause intentional damage to yourself with a quick hit?
<Polydunami> Hello, HoodyNinja
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Hi :)
<Reikim> Perfect, a knife.
<oni_link> ohhhh shiiiiiiiiii
<Meanwhile> Your body pulls the punch at the last second.
<CriticKitten> "I can't do it! I have to do it, for Shaun! But I can't do it! But I have to~"
<Polydunami> dat contradiction :D
<DarkStratos> hahaha
<DarkStratos> your not dying
<Wirisme> yeah this is just saw now
<Meanwhile> You're*
<cachi01|phone> If this was IRL i would be fucking scared
<Buytoast> was that an electronic saw?
<DarkStratos> just causing yourself intense pain
<HoodyNinja> The hell happened?
<Reikim> Ah
<SpeedyBolt> Basically
<Reikim> I see
<Meanwhile> Saw through your finger. Good idea jethro.
<SpeedyBolt> Ethan has 5 minutes to cut off a section of his finger, HoodyNinja
<oni_link> holy hell this is heavy, doc
<Klumzeedragon> Those tools of dismemberment. :D
<DarkStratos> wait..why does he need a saw AND a cleaver..
<Reikim> He'll have to go knife, bonesaw, then perhaps scissors for close work.
<Kinixys> Need a tourniquet.
<DerpyMuffins> Do you really need a saw to cut off a finder?
<cachi01|phone> I cut his finger with the scissors lol
<DarkStratos> why did he look at a propane tank..?
<Reikim> DarkStratos: Knife for flesh, saw for bone.
<oni_link> Kinixys: High and tight
<Kandarihu> If I were in his shoes, I'd choose the pinkie finger... and I'd get the severed part put in a glass of milk as soon as possible, and get it to a doctor.
<Buytoast> he gonna cauterize it?
<Buytoast> shit son you're insane
<Meanwhile> Cauterise the wound.
<Klumzeedragon> DarkStratos: I think you get to pick what you want to use.
<Kinixys> Or just cauterize it?
<SpeedyBolt> Milk?
<Reikim> He needs the fire to cauterize it afterwards.
<twilight_sprinkle> das gonna hurt
<flutterchu> http://derpy.me/8a4KX this is what i mean by dari and teardrop READ THE WHLE THING

<VenHur> SCISSORS!

<Klumzeedragon> Wewt! The Skizzors win. :D
<SpeedyBolt> Oh my god

<SpeedyBolt> I'm turning away now.
<Wirisme> scissors wouldn't work I'm sure
<twilight_sprinkle> scissors arent fun
<Buytoast> In a bout of cruelty, the scissors ended up being safety scissors.
<cachi01|phone> Reikim eenope... I cut his finger with the scissors lol

<Klumzeedragon> KHAAAAAAAAAAN!
<Meanwhile> This is probably the best acting in this so far.
<DarkStratos> As i take a break to go play piano with my fingers....
<SpeedyBolt> This...this is dedication.
<DerpyMuffins> So much lol
*Maid_RainBow hugs oni_link
<Dovah> should i laugh or cringe? im so confused!
<Reikim> He loves his son.
<Jason> question, how does the tablet know if he cuts off his finger or not?
<SpeedyBolt> He really would do ALL OF THIS to save his son.
<CriticKitten> This is actually decent acting. Huh.
<Meanwhile> Jason: Camera.
<Buytoast> now burn it
<JESmith71> Ow
<AJIsAwesome> SpeedyBolt: Yep.
<HoodyNinja> Ow
<oni_link> Maid_RainBow: thank you, that was intense
<SpeedyBolt> World's best dad.
<Buytoast> and cleanse your body with falme
<cachi01|phone> Ouch
<CriticKitten> Too bad it took this long to get there.
<HoodyNinja> that one made me cringe
<DerpyMuffins> Im laughing right now
<VenHur> Oh god...I FEEL SO DAMN SORRY FOR HIM!
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Meanwhile> Burned right in the finger stump.
<SpeedyBolt> I want to cry now.
<Kinixys> ... oh
<soulrider951> BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS GREAT!!!
<SpeedyBolt> This is so painful to wtach
<SpeedyBolt> *watch
<DarkStratos> oh thought he was gonna go for the saw
<twilight_sprinkle> funny how this game started with kids balloons and clows
<Reikim> I hope to GOD that this origami bastard gets what's coming to him.
<twilight_sprinkle> *clowns
<zerograv5> i feel SO sorry for him
<Moopy> this is like Pinkamena stuff like this
<JusticeKoro> I have been playing things like Mortal Kombat since I was 6 and this is really hard to watch
<Klumzeedragon> Floorboard PAENCH!
<Klumzeedragon> PAWNCH*
<Maid_RainBow> oni_link: thats okay i hope it helped
<DerpyMuffins> Where is his finder?
<Meanwhile> Not gonna lie, part of my finger feels real odd atm.
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03wasn't he supposed to bite on a stick?
<Kinixys> .....
<oni_link> I feel a bit better Maid_RainBow
<DarkStratos> cant even read that.. or see it
<SpeedyBolt> I've seen people get murdered before...but this is much worse.
<VenHur> Anakin Skywalker: "Don't worry man, you'll get your own robot finger by the end of this game."
<Kandarihu> The violence of Mortal Kombat is military in nature. This violence isn't.
<DarkStratos> ya
<CriticKitten> Scoot: Yes, so he doesn't bite off his tongue.
<DarkStratos> this is civvie violence
<Reikim> This is psychologically painful.
<VenHur> Anakin Skywalker: "Oh wait, wrong movie...SORRY!"
<Klumzeedragon> NAHMAN_JAYDEN: Probably. Caramel probably forgot or wanted us to hear him scream.
<oni_link> Reikim: yeah
<MASF123|> So angry rifht now.
<SpeedyBolt> ...Poor Ethan
<MASF123|> right
<Wirisme> made my teeth clench
<Caramel> 2,14 hey, I asked the chat
*Maid_RainBow holds oni_link tightly "you will be okay"
<HoodyNinja> That looked painful
<Klumzeedragon> :D
<Caramel> 2,14 and they said scissors
<DarkStratos> well off to play 15 minutes of piano after watching the chat...
<DarkStratos> and vid
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03... I think Val would WANT us to hea him scream
<DarkStratos> lol
<DarkStratos> random achievvy
<Klumzeedragon> Butcher.
<HoodyNinja> We said saw!
<Klumzeedragon> Nice.
<Meanwhile> Personally I still like the "You" that the tablet said before he screamed was quite funny.
<HoodyNinja> but whatever
<Buytoast> He should've used the sword from the beginning.
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03hear*
<Kinixys> I saw a lot of scissors.
<Buytoast> That woulda been some poetic justice or somethin.
*oni_link feels a bit more secure in Maid_RainBow 's arms
<cachi01|phone> Caramel.....u know.... I could.just give u the location without having.to cut.your goddamn finger.....
<Reikim> It's not painful to watch because of the violence per se. It's painful because of the psychology behind it.
<Dovah> Caramel: never listen to the chat on that kind of thing
<SpeedyBolt> I saw Scissors more.
<Caramel> 2,14 I've already beat the game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you din't use disinfectant
<Reikim> Self-mutilation is far more disturbing than violence towards others.
<Caramel> 2,14 I merely asked which weapon you wanted
<Kandarihu> Well, if it wasn't scissors, it would've been the bone saw. It doesn't matter how he severed his finger. The shocking thing is that he actually did.
<Reikim> Caramel: What would have happened with the others?
<JusticeKoro> My pinkie finger is starting to hurt a little
<Caramel> 2,14 some are easier than others
*Maid_RainBow softly strokes oni_link over his head
<HoodyNinja> Everyone in this chat could be a psychologyst
<Wirisme> my head hurts now
<Moopy> Hey are you guys still a little bit mad at me for what i did about few minutes ago?
<SpeedyBolt> The scissors would probably be more painful than the saw.
<Reikim> Knife is easiest, isn't it?
<Reikim> The scissors was just freaking cruel.
<VenHur> ...I'm going to have nightmares of poor Ethan...Just...dear god...
<Reikim> And stupid.
<cachi01|phone> Reikim less pain. First time i.completed the game i used scissors xd
*oni_link sighs in relief
<NAHMAN_JAYDEN> 00,03Alright dudes! I'm off to bed
<Kandarihu> He's going to feel that phantom finger for the rest of his life.
<SpeedyBolt> Aww
<AJIsAwesome> NAHMAN_JAYDEN: Night! :)

<Reikim> And why is she getting involved?

<HoodyNinja> ah rats!
<Meanwhile> Oh noooo, raaats, waaaaaa grow up lady.
<Reikim> Oh no, rats!
<Reikim> Ethan: Shut up I'm missing my goddamn finger.
<HoodyNinja> Bears are scarier
<Meanwhile> They're only rats. The worst they can do is climb into your toilet and bite you in the ass.
<SpeedyBolt> Meanwhile: LOL
<Reikim> You're so hardcore, lady.
<Meanwhile> SpeedyBolt: You think I'm kidding?
<SpeedyBolt> Meanwhile: I want to say yes...but...

<SpeedyBolt> What are you going to do

<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Nah. Sounds like the best plan ever.
<SpeedyBolt> you're behind a gate.
<Meanwhile> Rats have been known to swim into plumbing pipes, and consequently, have ended up in toilets. Some unfortunate souls sit down without checking, and then...well, lets just say they usually need stitches.
<Kandarihu> So Ethan Mars, who is suspected of being the Origami Killer, is the guy who just cut his finger off, right?
<Buytoast> yes
<Meanwhile> That's right.
<cachi01|phone> yes lol
<HoodyNinja> Sounds kinky
<Reikim> Pretty much.
<Reikim> Um

<Reikim> Seriously, why is she so happy to get involved with him?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: almost all tracks are electrified nowadays afaik
