<Reikim> That's why I know art even though I'll never use it.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: that would cheer her up I think.
<Alister> that too
<Petrified_Discord> otakon: Take this money or I'll kill you! :[
<otakon> I HATE THAT RULE!
<Reikim> Do art. Art is fun. Also it's meditative.

<CriticKitten> Sumica: He'll blow ALL the things.
<Sumica> 00,10Luna is probably PTFO atm
*Derpy_Hooves shrugs i unno
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> PTFO?
<Meanwhile> Well, nothing has ever made me feel quite like an idiot as those pages do.
<RAWRity> Basically: we talk about but we wish to, with little to no regard of what "haters" would say about it, because by trying to actively prove them wrong, we let them control us. To be an individual, one must ultimately follow what they feel is right for them, rather than let the expectations of other sway them into normalcy or purposeful non-conformity.
<Sumica> 00,10Passed the fuck out
<otakon> Sumica: probably but she deserves the rest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Shizuka too much to make a bad first impression around her.

<Reikim> Now I have a mental image of Shizu running around beating people to death with a pool noodle. It's both adorable and terrifying.
<hen3ry> gun. No formula for gunpowder.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Also, to use a pool noodle as a weapon means shizuka has exotic weapon proficiency.
<otakon> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: it's a long styrofoam noodle that you swing around in the pool
<otakon> wow, they are VERY easily amused
<Shizuka> 13sweetiebot gets it
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Oh, that. Okay.

<Reikim> Shizuka: Ah, going with the dual-class for maximum versatility?
<otakon> Shizuka the Skald! Level 18
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I honestly wish I knew where mips.tv was hosted from so that we could do speedtests.
<Shizuka> 13since the alternative is to let some AI handle the rogue-ing or tank-ing and they're usually not good at it

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka, when did you go from using a cane to using a pool noodle?
<Shizuka> 13dad and i multiplayer-d NWN1 once, he rolled a pretty straightforward kill-every-last-thing-in-the-room guy and i went with the rogue that occasionally drops out of ranged combat to run up and beat you with a sword
<Shamroc> Shizuka...depedning on what game it is....im norm in the back shooting sutt
<otakon> Shizuka: AI is NEVER good for tanking. Look at Alister from Dragon Age Origins. Designated tank, but AI drives him idiotically while my lesser level and equipped main character tank whoops major darkspawn heiney.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that's why i don't read that much :p
<Insane> I'm bored
<Alister> otakon: wat ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> o hai Shamroc

<otakon> Shizuka: yeah, you'd think STOPPING THE MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS would be important for them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When did you go from cane to pool noodle?
<Reikim> The worst thing you can do - the ABSOLUTE WORST - is let the AI heal. Absolutely no prioritizing skill.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I can't not read I see letters I read them as soon as I know they are letters
<Shizuka> 13am not sure..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.

<hen3ry> any lunatic can wield a chainsaw or a machete. Wielding a pool noodle...

<otakon> dammit
<xxMoopyxx> Hey i had some griefers on fortresscraft and i kicked some of them out cause i do not trust any griefers at all cause i had a huge grief in my world
<Reikim> Most embarrassing thing is when you read a paragraph, start reading the next, and realize you don't understand it because you never actually read the first.
<Shizuka> 13that is why you don't host public minecraft servers
<otakon> dammit Veemi is lagging out more for me than mips was
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<Shizuka> 13that was about the last quarter of galt's speech for me in atlas shrugged
<otakon> probably me though tbh
<Reikim> xxMoopyxx: Or you could get anti-grief plugins.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Reikim best part
<Shizuka> 13i was trying to follow the philosophy but after a while my brain went "come on get the plot moving already"
<xxMoopyxx> whats a anti grief?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Is when you read so fast your brain laughs
<Dumorimasoddaa> Lags
<Sparrowfeather> watch the language ponies
<otakon> ofc he cheats
<Dumorimasoddaa> So upto minuets later you know what you read
<xxMoopyxx> what does that do?
<otakon> stab him again
<Reikim> Not so good when your mouth lags behind your brain, or vice-versa.
<Dumorimasoddaa> So handy with text books

<otakon> KILL HIM
<Sumica> 00,10I cant stream with them doing this
<Sparrowfeather> What are we watching anyway
<Dumorimasoddaa> You can't hyper read fiction it gets too confusing

<xxMoopyxx> and plus i had some help from my recent player friends that i met in fortresscraft they helped me rebuild it back up cause im trying to keep my world safe from griefers
<Shizuka> 13also i spent a lot on it... would be a very expensive meal..

<wicked> sup
<Shizuka> 13just whitelist it
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3
<Sumica> 00,10probably gonna swap to cable internet here soon™
<Dumorimasoddaa> I stare at pages until I know their secretes
*Dumorimasoddaa politely informs you that if he stops speaking, unconsciousness is the likely cause
<ponibas> For the greater good!™
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Are you on DSL?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Just plug the kindle into the socket in your aural unit and download it
<xxMoopyxx> Hey do you guys have fortresscraft?
<Sparrowfeather> cablenet is best net

<Sparrowfeather> thats a slow way to do it miss
<ponibas> fios isnt everywhere.. sadly
<hen3ry> I'm on Cox. It's not great, but it seems to be better than the local alternatives.
<Petrified_Discord> I download WIFI from the future.
<Shizuka> 13US has terribad internet
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's COx or century link here
<hen3ry> Vegas internet is worst pony.

<xxMoopyxx> BRB
<XAX> lol Shizu
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I remember when I had DSL. I was supposed to install filters on every phone jack in my house to prevent signal leakage. Apparently I was still getting it. I think there's another phone jack that I never knew about.
<Petrified_Discord> Dat kick :D
<otakon> wow, that was the WORSE troll attempt I have seen IN A WHILE!
<Sumica> 00,10Century link>Embarq>ATT>Sprint>ATT
<hen3ry> can't even spell "otherwords"
<otakon> Troll Rating of 0.1
<otakon> out of 100
<hen3ry> so sad our educational ratings have fallen so far
<d3rb> f- troll
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, hopefully
<Shizuka> 13come on come back so i can get the ban..
<Petrified_Discord> Troll Rating Sad/10
<Sparrowfeather> troll rated 2 less than 0
<otakon> Shizuka: well,they are getting smarter in that regard at least
<owlicious> so sad we acknowledge crappy trolling.
<Sumica> 00,10I sneesed and missed a troll
<otakon> owlicious: it's funny
<otakon> Sumica: eeyup
<Petrified_Discord> It's just been so long...
<owlicious> It's obvious macs are better than pcs anyway
<d3rb> hes back
<Sparrowfeather> poor miss sumica
<otakon> where?
<d3rb> wait not sure actually
<ponibas> omfg.. hi's spelling as worse than Sumicas
<d3rb> may be a new name
<ponibas> :D
<owlicious> *his
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> As far as my area is concerned, EPB>Comcast>AT&T
<d3rb> damn, gone
<Petrified_Discord> Commodore 64 > All other computers
<Reikim> Hm. Starting to wonder whether playing Bioshock after midnight is a good idea.
<otakon> who the hell is debug?
<ponibas> lmao
<owlicious> what?
<ponibas> 90lbs eh?
<otakon> I was looking through the users list
<otakon> and noticed debug is all
*Petrified_Discord runs debug.exe
<hen3ry> meh
<d3rb> there was someone called lackingfans that joined otakon, i thought it may have been another atempt but they left fast
<Sparrowfeather> this stream is a victim of mass modding. and thats awesome
<otakon> ah
<Sumica> 00,10better to go by the hostmask d3rb
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> The lowest speed my ISP offers is 30 mbps synchronous. How does this compare internationally? Average?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01US has internet that costs too much.
<Shizuka> 1330/30?
<panda-homework> ^
<otakon> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: I'm lucky if I get 2.5 mbps
<d3rb> oh yeah
<hen3ry> always hostmask unless is actually smart guy
<otakon> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: and only average .7 up
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Well, megabits.
*owlicious hates you.
<hen3ry> usernames are useless.
<owlicious> oh, bits
<otakon> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: you lucky bastard you
<otakon> wait
<Sparrowfeather> 6.0 mbs here
<ponibas> is US upload is usually severly restricted compared to DL rates
<otakon> how much is a megabit?
<Shizuka> 1312/4 here ish
<Sumica> 00,102/20 here
<owlicious> 1/8 of a megabyte
<otakon> GODDAMMIT
<Petrified_Discord> otakon: lol
<Shizuka> 132 down 20 up? o.o
<no> hi
<otakon> owlicious: so translates to about the same actually
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/CqK24
<hen3ry> there he is
<Sumica> 00,10revers that Shizuka
<otakon> no: bye
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<hen3ry> hi=no
<ponibas> i'm like 20/4
<no> bi noob
<no> grats on watching a show meant for 6 years old
<d3rb> otakon is the master of kicks
*owlicious waves
<otakon> and ban in three
<otakon> two
<ponibas> WOOT!
<owlicious> FIRST
<otakon> one and GONE!
<Petrified_Discord> BAM kick
<Sumica> 00,10bye specal ed
<ponibas> boom, headshot!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I got 15/3 at my old apartment for $53.95
<panda-homework> Dat ban!
<Petrified_Discord> ponibas: :D
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: that's bullshit
<otakon> hiya panda-homework how are you doing man?
<Shizuka> 13i'm pretty sure FiM isn't targeted at 6yo
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Well, everyone prefers Cable internet right? Cable was only really meant to transfer data one way. So it's unnatural to have synchronous internet like that.
<Shizuka> 1312 maybe
<Sparrowfeather> NOSCOPE= WIN
*ponibas cheers Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could go to some places in Europe and get twice that for the same price.
<otakon> Shizuka: 6 year old's could barely understand what's going on.
<Sumica> 00,10tv Y so yeah Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13$75+ here for 12/4
<owlicious> the toys say 3+. Should we check transcripts for reading level?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think the UK may have it worse.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it's called US bullshit
<Shizuka> 13well yeah tv y
<hen3ry> ratings != target
<ponibas> i am paying less for 20/4 then i was 12/3
<otakon> honestly, I'd rather have internet than cable at this point
<Shizuka> 13but the general structure of the show is more towards the upper range of childhood
<ponibas> @ 60/mo
<hen3ry> at least not always
<panda-homework> otakon im doing well, just homework and doing some drawings. How are you my good buddy ^-^
<Petrified_Discord> But US has best bullshit :(
<otakon> Shizuka: 10 and up eh?
<xxMoopyxx> Im back
<Shizuka> 13more or less ja
<otakon> wb xxMoopyxx you missed the silly troll
<Shizuka> 13not into the action range of teenagers
<xxMoopyxx> what happend
<Shizuka> 13depending on the ep
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: "grats on watching a show meant for 6yrsolds"
<otakon> and BANNED
<xxMoopyxx> hahahahahahahahaha
<hen3ry> Stargate is meant for 6 year olds? *gasp*
<Petrified_Discord> xxMoopyxx: Banhoof brought down HARD
<Shizuka> 13do i have to do the paperwork on that... do not think he will be back...
<otakon> hen3ry: :) you kidder you.
<hen3ry> xD
<Sparrowfeather> xxMoopyxx you missed 2 trolls
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US create the idea of the internet, yet we pay high rates for it.
<panda-homework> ^
<xxMoopyxx> well its paused my screen here
<Shizuka> 13afaik it's mostly ma bell's fault
<otakon> Shizuka: he won't be, it was very half assed. Hell it was quarter assed really
<Sumica> 00,10hen3ry you are asuming they even realise there is a video
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> those "Trolls" dissapoint me
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: stream is over atm
<hen3ry> I assume nothing, I merely mock all
<Shizuka> 13breaking up ma bell left us with local carriers with exclusive control over the pipes
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I kind of understand why our speeds aren't up to an international standard. Most users don't really need tremendously fast speeds like what Japan or Korea gets. Even though otakon clearly doesn't have enough bandwidth, I have as much as most people would need, maybe more.
<Sumica> 00,10bst to do it any ways Shizuka.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That might be the problem.
<xxMoopyxx> so its at atm now huh?
<Sumica> 00,10saves me having to dig up logs
<hen3ry> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: because our infrastructure is the oldest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Low competition = high prices.
<otakon> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: once again you lucky bastard, I'm on Verizon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With only two carriers in State College, prices will be high.
<panda-homework> Nittany_Discord imagine no competition O_O
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you'd think consumers would be fed up with this bullshit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know if there are more carriers in other countries.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I'm on my ISPs minimum level. They also offer 50mbps, 100mbps and 1000mbps, iirc
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01US consumers are weak.
<hen3ry> 2 carriers is basically no competition.
<otakon> panda-homework: that's known as a monopoly and US is friggin OBESSESSED with making them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Plus, the internet is a big necessity.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you have choice of DSL or Cable
<otakon> Monopolies are BAD
<xxMoopyxx> do you think i should back out and unpause the thing or what?
<panda-homework> otakon oh i know this too well....
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's always a good idea
<hen3ry> bad unreliable service, or unreliable bad service. Same price.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US has laws against monopolies that can be helped.
<Shizuka> 13i'm on the wrong side of the freeway for DSL so it's comcast, satellite, or dialup..
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: Sumica is not streaming for now, his net is borking
<Petrified_Discord> I miss my college internet. Streaming 2 1080p movies wirelessly may seem superfluous until you actually DO it. Then you can't stop :(
<panda-homework> Dailup still exists?????
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<xxMoopyxx> Oh crap thats not good
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> On top of that, it's not a major ISP, so they're not even part of that Copyright Alerts program. Meaning I won't get throttled for copyright infringement.
<Dumorimasoddaa> You've not played a game enough till your ingame parinoia leaks in to RL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some places can only get dial-up.
<panda-homework> What! Where?
<MakerDusk> SuperBrony64: you turning on your wii yet?
<Sumica> 00,10I had a place I love in in "city of indistry" CA that was so bad you could not even get 56.6
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: well we have the antitrust laws, but in 90% of cases where you have one operator in the area, it's the city/county/state that said "only this provider can operate here"
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: I'd be happy with ONE 720p movie in the amount of time it takes to watch it.
<Petrified_Discord> otakon: lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's called natural monopoly.
<Shizuka> 13so literally no other company can come in and lay line
<hen3ry> Industry. shudder.
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: hell, I'd be happy with a 480p movie
<xxMoopyxx> hows is he going to get his stream working again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it's hard to get another carrier there.
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: he's not, he's done for now, no stream atm is all there is to it.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Franchise laws, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13couldn't get into bioshock..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sucks.
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And low competition = high prices.
<xxMoopyxx> Dag nab it
<Dumorimasoddaa> I loved it
<Sumica> 00,10xxMoopyxx I wait till my ISP is done working on the lines in the area
<Dumorimasoddaa> Years ago...
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: that it does
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3
<Shizuka> 13it gets extra silly when you have a case like whatever town it was south of me in MN that wanted to lay municipal fiber lines
<xxMoopyxx> oh cool
<Shizuka> 13and the telco whined and sued
<MakerDusk> 19.99 for 50mbps
<Petrified_Discord> Here otakon, enjoy this picture of a movie XD http://derpy.me/bmQyK
<xxMoopyxx> well stream it
<MakerDusk> \o/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MakerDusk: Not a US carrier?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I liked both Bioshocks. I should replay one sometime soon....
<otakon> GODDAMMIT I SO WANT TO SEE THE AVENGERS!
*MakerDusk is proud to be canadian
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<otakon> but I don't want to pirate it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really wish I could move out of the US.
<Shizuka> 13afaik canada has stupid low bandwidth limits though
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: same here, TO CANADA!
<Shizuka> 13from what i hear it's Rogers or bust
<MakerDusk> I've got unlimited
<otakon> where the woman are like the men!
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka in the UK nearly all the lines are owned by the same compony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Expensive internet that is monitored for the copyright monopoly.
<owlicious> university internet is okay
<otakon> brawny and they drink maple syrup and wrestle BEARS
<xxMoopyxx> so i guess the stream is all broken right now?
<owlicious> otakon: you mean russia, right?
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I've been hearing scary things about Canada's internet. Something about strict bandwidth metering.
<panda-homework> otakon not reeally a good thing >.> i like my women.... women like
<Dumorimasoddaa> But it rents them to its competitors and they often out provide it
<Sumica> 00,10ok you want a stream go ahead and hit refresh for one ^_^
<otakon> xxMoopyxx: not broken, OFF what part of OFF do you lnot understand?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Best go to Denmark.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Cause idk
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or somewhere else.
<otakon> Sumica: oh God
<xxMoopyxx> Jeeze sorry bro
<Dumorimasoddaa> Way the systems built
<hen3ry> yay my favorite ep
<owlicious> Rain cloud!
<Dumorimasoddaa> 2 was …
<Petrified_Discord> Sumica: You...lol
<otakon> oh it's Derpiculties
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before the copyright monopoly destroys the internet for the US.
<Rain> What, owlicious?
<otakon> DERPICULTIES
<otakon> TECHNICAL DERPICULTIES!
<Shizuka> 13oh look my derpy video
<Petrified_Discord> Derpy doesn't know how to gravity.
<xxMoopyxx> get out of the hot water man and go take a dip in the cool water in the pool
<otakon> Shizuka: one of your wonderful videos
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You should finish your intermission video.
<Shizuka> 13not so wonderful i could do better
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: gravity is her servant, like Pinkie
<otakon> Shizuka: well it's still nice
<Shizuka> 13i'm still hiding from vegas though...
<Sumica> 00,10Would love to see that one finished
<otakon> Shizuka: you can do EET!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I dont get the hate for 2. The story wasnt as good as 1 I'll agree, and it didnt have the impact of going to the underwater city the first time, but still fun.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Nittany_Discord, the pirate community is so tenacious, I honestly can't see the copyright monopolies ever winning out in the end.
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder if I could embed a playlist
<owlicious> oh, it's a youtube video
<Shizuka> 13award show scared me off video editing for a while
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys, camaderie is Supernatural is better than any abridged
<Shizuka> 13you can embed a playlist yes but it won't sync for everyone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not just pirates. People that are getting shafted.
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just a shame it uploads very slowly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Turning to piracy or at least backing them.
<Shizuka> 13if anyone out there knows how to get an iframe for synchtube, let us know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm pretty much a pirate party member though I don't actively pirate.
<xxMoopyxx> DUKE says: "Hail to the king everypony"
<Sumica> 00,10geting urges to go play simcity 4
<hen3ry> I prefer the Surprise Party, myself, but I can respect the Pirates.
<Shizuka> 13speaking of jon st jon, i hear he's doing voices in dota 2?
<Sumica> 00,10I would totaly upload tons to a sync tube if we could figure out how to embed in here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's only because I agree with their stance on copyright law reform and stopping corporations from being able to write stupid laws like SOPA that do no real good to society.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I got around 120 GIG of bandwith
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I'm in canada
<d3rb> i hope the next sim city doesdnt suck
<owlicious> Nittany_Discord: but they're losing Quadrillions of dollars!
<Mutterguy> in my imagination derpy's eyes are making the bass sound
<Shizuka> 13d3rb: the details that are coming out aren't pretty
<Shizuka> 13sounds like sim city societies part 2
<d3rb> sigh
<CrimsonPhoenix> d3rb, it's EA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're making more than losing, and piracy figures aren't even accurate.
<Mutterguy> fuck
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the DLC from it is extremely predictable
<d3rb> oh ffs, that games SUUUCKED though.....BETRAYEL
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Is this a new video that Shizuka did? The music adds in a nice sense of tension. Representing the feelings of distressed viewers losing patience for the video to start as the hard-working mods get things worked out behind the scenes.
<Shizuka> 13sounds like singleplayer is nonexistent, requires origin, MASSIVE DLC at launch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The next Sim City already has bad DRM.
<Shizuka> 13OnDaCountOfKandarihu: new no, been up for a few months now
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah bad DRM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA's going to ruin the game with their shit business practices again.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Still fun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like they did to ME3.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I see.
<Shizuka> 13uploaded jan 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA's fucking nuts.
<d3rb> EA please go bankrupt
<Dumorimasoddaa> But Bioshock 1 was mostly story
<Shizuka> 13oh wow i did this before even being abducted onto the bs2.0 project
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is the stream on?
<CrimsonPhoenix> better just pirate SimsCity 2000 and play that instead
<Dumorimasoddaa> Setting impact was less underwater
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too fucking corporate to run a decent gaming publishing house.
<d3rb> ill stick with sim city 4
<Mutterguy> Simcity 4 is fine
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What's a good dare to ask someone? O.O
<Shizuka> 13sc4 was good
<Dumorimasoddaa> And more 1950's biotech crazyness
<otakon> EA in a Nutshell is HILARIOUS
<owlicious> SuperBrony64: wear a pony maid outfit
<hen3ry> you need more context, SB64
<d3rb> rush hour expansion pack....awww yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wanting to charge people to reload their weapons in an FPS.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, Dare them to drink hot sauce
<Shizuka> 13EA is tanking hard
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: wait what?
<TheRareP0N3> DERPY
<otakon> no really, what?
<owlicious> dare them to drink hot sauce and vodka?
<Shizuka> 13Activision is the only one of the big four that's still vaguely growing
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: what game?
<superretroworld> derpy looks like rainbow dash just different colours and eyes
<TheRareP0N3> hi everypony. :
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I offered to wear a maid outfit, but no-one paid the money to make it happen.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: Dunno. They wanted to do it in a BF game.
<d3rb> i got 4 buts?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I has no monez...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> EA is tanking hard o_o
<superretroworld> hey TheRareP0N3
<d3rb> bits**
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But the CEO of EA did talk about it.
<TheRareP0N3> Shizuka: Activison is horrible. ._.
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Also, you got to use a drill. this pleased me to no end.
<Shizuka> 13it's probably only because of WoW and CoD they're still floating
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision is growing because of CoD.
<TheRareP0N3> Shizuka: They shut down alteriwnet because of fucking mw3
<superretroworld> what problems are we having?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i miss Interplay
<TheRareP0N3> We're derping
<TheRareP0N3> THAT'S THE PROBLEM
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: wait, REALLY? you are SHITTING me, they wanted people to actually pay to be able to reload their weapons? THE FUCK!
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I miss Black Isle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Game companies are crazy.
<hen3ry> I literally don't remember the last game before Kerbal that I bought. And I'm one of the rare ones that hasn't pirated a single game this century, I think.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> otakon: they're Obsidian Entertainment now
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: that is the downright stupidest fucking money grab I have ever heard of
<JESmith> Derpy problems. They let Derpy run the stream
<Sumica> 00,10So did you all make sure to check your computeres for that malware before the fbi shuts down the backup DNS this monday?
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: and InExile
<Shizuka> 13note to future shizu... soon as things cool down enough to mess with FMLE/scrcap, find out of BG Tutu would sttream well
<otakon> Sumica: wait, what?
<TheRareP0N3> I only play MW2 to hack it. :D
<d3rb> pardon?
<owlicious> nope.
<Shizuka> 13i haven't heard anything of this supposed monday malware
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AlterIWnet got shut down?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, I'm in canada so...
<owlicious> how does one reset dns servers anyway
<TheRareP0N3> Yeah
<TheRareP0N3> It's been down for a while
<TheRareP0N3> But
<otakon> okay, that is utter bullshit
<Sumica> 00,10it started in Canada
<Shizuka> 13one doesn't
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Companies should value people's business, not their money. A company in any industry that can't treat their customers right doesn't deserve to be big.
<TheRareP0N3> Fourdeltaone is back up. :D
<TheRareP0N3> google it
<hen3ry> there was some old malware that changed your DNS server, so the hackers would have control over it... when the FBI knocked it out, they put up a duplicate DNS server so those people wouldn't lose the 'net.
<owlicious> i mean the dns server your computer uses
<Shizuka> 13of the 13 root nameservers i think eleven are anycasted, which means they don't exist in one place
<d3rb> whats an alteriw net?
<Shizuka> 13ohhhhhhh was that the conficker fallout?
<Mutterguy> alternet
<Kencolt> I know about that. I already tewsted for that DNS virus- and am clean. Lucky me.
<Shizuka> 13or one of the other big worms
<Sumica> 00,10back in 2011 som group set up some Redirect malware and a bunch of DNS that used it
<otakon> well I'm fine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a dedicated server mod for MW2.
<otakon> my computer is less than a year old
<TheRareP0N3> not only that
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I read about that DNS changer thing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So you could have dedicated servers in MW2.
<otakon> Sumica: any idea what I should look for though?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because the base game used matchmaking lobbies.
<otakon> bc I do NOT want to lose my net
<Shizuka> 13considering most people are going to be getting their DNS settings from their provider's DHCP, i doubt there's anything you have to do
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> But Google would tell me if I have the malware on any website they own, right?
<TheRareP0N3> Nittany_Discord: It's back up, google fourdeltaone. :P you might need to get skidrow and put the files in there if it's down. if you have it on steam, just place the updater in the files and click it
<Shizuka> 13if it's a case of the FBI stopping service to a DNS server, the ISP should pick it up
<d3rb> i remember that Nittany_Discord, one of the things i hated about mw2
<hen3ry> wish I'd known about it before tho. The most common 'net outage I get on Cox in Vegas is DNS server fail.
<Shamroc> Sumica: what are you talkin bout?
<otakon> http://www.examiner.com/article/internet-malware-shutdown-monday-check-computer-online-advises-fbi
<hen3ry> Having a backup DNS wouldn't be bad.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My firefox is acting wonky
<Shizuka> 13i think i tried a couple times switching our house to google's dns but the router didn't like it much
<Shizuka> 13preferred to get everything from DHCP or nothing at all
<otakon> okay apparently I'm fine
<Kencolt> ayou can find out if you are infected by going to http://www.dns-ok.us/
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> This is one wierd ordeal. Hats off to the FBI for this.
<Sumica> 00,10http://www.dns-ok.us/
<otakon> yeah that
<Kencolt> At least in the US... it's the FBI scan site.
<Reikim> > see shotgun in middle of big empty space
<Reikim> > Instant paranoia
<otakon> well I'm okay
<otakon> yay! one less thing to worry about
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01IMHO, I don't think IW cares about the PC community. I remember the logs where they revealed that they were not putting dedicated servers in. They were boasting graphics options in the PC port like it was something special.
<hen3ry> it's not so much a scan site, I think... the FBI owns the "infected" DNS, so it can redirect infected users to a different "dns-ok.us" than everyone else gets.
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Alright. I'm getting green from that. I'm clean
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's like when the music kicks in
<Sumica> 00,10Shamroc, basickly some guys that ran many many paybyclick services
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"The PC port has adjustable graphics! So awesome!"
<Dumorimasoddaa> You know shuts gonna go down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not verbatim.
<owlicious> I'm getting a russian mail order bride advertisement from that. Is that good?
<d3rb> stupid consoles
<Sumica> 00,10Set up some fake DNS, and malware that changes the way your PC conects to the DNS
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_DQ2J-0a-o&feature=g-u-u
<hen3ry> owlicious: ooooh, order me one, my last one went bad in the fri.... nevermind
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So whats going on?
<Kencolt> Ine must applaud the FBI for this action.
<Sumica> 00,10after stoping the group the FBI took over said DNS and matained them for the last year to give people time to fix the issue
<owlicious> hen3ry: the mail order husband should be arriving a business day later with the mail order priest
<hen3ry> ...
<Sumica> 00,10mareorder bride =p
<hen3ry> curse you, owlicious. :D
<superretroworld> its not me, derpy looks just like rainbow dash, its just the colours that changed
<Erebus> E%THarthq$^hyjwjtytywjtyjtyjwtjty
<Derpy_Hooves> wha?
<owlicious> of course, i'm using derpy mail, so i might need to get redundant boxes
<Sumica> 00,10that's some nice face typeing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ban?
<JESmith> Well Derpy was just a random background pony at first, of course she was just a RD recolor
<Shizuka> 13waffleface still isn't in style
<owlicious> Derpy is just a daring do recolor
<Derpy_Hooves> wha?! D:
<Sumica> 00,10what about qwertyui head Shizuka?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Did anyones Firefox act weird just recently?
<owlicious> and strangely, the CMC were hanging out before the episode where they met
<Kencolt> I use Chrome these days, so.. no?
<superretroworld> Derpy_Hooves: sorry, but even you have to admit it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It would not load for me
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I've been hearing about people's Firefoxes acting wierd for weeks now.
<Derpy_Hooves> wha?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> it kept freezing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, this is the first time I've heard about this malware.
<Shizuka> 13i bit the bullet and switched to chrome, firefox was starting to feel the bloat
*Derpy_Hooves is confused
<superretroworld> owlicious: ya i saw that too
<Sumica> 00,10yeah same here Nitt
<TheRareP0N3> Nittany_Discord: What malaware?
<Shizuka> 13yeah this monday thing i haven't heard anything about, not even from the tech reddits
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shizuka: So good idea then?
<Sumica> 00,10I just heard about it on the news last night
<Kencolt> Nittany_Discord: I only heard about it today when checking the WoW forums. Lucky I was not infected...
<Shamroc> shizu...a bad thing about my browsers....firefox is the only one which seems to correctly run the stream and chat...
<TheRareP0N3> WHAT VIRUS
<TheRareP0N3> GOD DAMN
<Shizuka> 13there's still some things i'm not happy about, like flooding my process list with itself for the sandboxing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is this virus?
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Okay. Mine freezes up every few times. I blame Flash. It seems to be more stable than before, but hardly perfectly stable
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka mostly as they where all over it last year and early this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Firefox for chatzilla.
<Shizuka> 13speaking of news
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I like chrome because it seems faster
<owlicious> oh. The FBI set up DNS servers which 200000 people are using to locate sites for mail, banking, etc. They're shutting it down soon, though.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> and I have themes...
<Shizuka> 13apparently some CNN person did an article/video on bronies?
<Kencolt> Nice Technical Derpiculties screen, by the way.
<Shizuka> 13seems to have been received well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't know Shizuka.
<xxMoopyxx> Hang on im going to back out and in to get the thing oing on my screen again hang on
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Can someone explain what this virus is?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So i can avoid it?
<superretroworld> Shizuka: and the person who was hosting is a brony
<Shizuka> 13you probably don't have to do anything
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Could check EqD.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe tomorrow. I'm tired.
<MakerDusk> SuperBrony64: let's get this show on the road!
<Kencolt> Shizuka: SHe has her own OC pony now. With her show's logo as a cutie mark.
<MakerDusk> SuperBrony64: let's get this show on the road!
<xxMoopyxx> just let me try
<MakerDusk> SuperBrony64: let's get this show on the road!
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: go to the site to check, it's malware
<owlicious> 34?
<Shizuka> 13like i said most people get DNS from their ISP's DHCP these days (yes so many acronyms, google them)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/uUVJq
<Shizuka> 13meaning it'll automatically update if anything needed to be changed
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Um, the virus is no longer in the wild, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's get this MakerDusk on the road!
<superretroworld> i knew this was coming, i heard months ago that the FBI was going to shut down internet for a day to get rid of a spreading virus
<owlicious> lol
<Shizuka> 13probably a lot of sensationalism around
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws a boulder into the chat
<hen3ry> er... the FBI doesn't have an internet kill switch.
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: but you know I'm kick proof :p
<otakon> apparetnly Homestuck spawned an anime
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has rejoined chat* hello
<Kencolt> OK. CrimsonPhoenix , that suggests that there are still people who are at 56K?!?
<Shizuka> 13it would be unimaginably hard to kill DNS
<Shamroc> MakerDusk...what break the stream this time? whats wrong with you man...
<owlicious> I once saw a workplace which had mlp and care bear toys on people's desks.
<Shizuka> 13also
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh? It's just an article
<owlicious> Justin beiber cutouts were used to scare people for fun
<Shizuka> 13i am surprised no one has burst out in rage at the derpy video i made here...
<owlicious> The ponies were g3
<xxMoopyxx> hey are you guys seeing this on screen
<superretroworld> hen3ry: well there gonna do it someway to get rid of the virus
<Shizuka> 13inb4 "why"
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: and im glad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> yhw
<Derpy_Hooves> so much derpy spam ; A;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But your Derpy video is awesome!
<Reikim> So, how do you switch your plasmids around?
<owlicious> Shizuka: it's a great improvement.
<Derpy_Hooves> it is
<Shizuka> 13there is a very good reason you should all be raging hard now though...
<owlicious> Shizuka: is it the NEW DITSY?
<hen3ry> superretroworld: they're going to shut down one DNS server, affecting only people who were infected by that virus
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Por qua?
<Reikim> I guess you have to do it at a specific place?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the walking derpy has straight eyes
<Barbetos> Go on.
<xxMoopyxx> but do you guys see what it says on the screen?
<Shizuka> 13a cookie to the silly filly that spots it
*owlicious gets cleaver
<hen3ry> the rest of the internet will be fine
<superretroworld> the video is just pure normal, i like it
<owlicious> it's a youtube loop?
<Shizuka> 13actually there's two major problems but i'm only cookie-ing for the big one
<owlicious> the cutie mark is wrong?
<superretroworld> hen3ry: oh i thought it was the internet
<owlicious> the hair is wrong?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the cutie mark color?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the tail?
<Shizuka> 13nope nope and nope
<owlicious> cutie mark is stars
<DB_Brony> her hair and tail have a different colour?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, on the derpiculty thing
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Shizuka> 13yup, there's two major problems
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how can I tell if I have this virus?
<owlicious> asking us to stretch?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Grammar is one.
<Shizuka> 13but i am only giving a cookie for one of them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Capitalize.
<Shizuka> 13the one that would cause the most rage
<Phase4> 00,02the upside down derpy has a dark blue cutie mark instead of the light grey
<Shizuka> 13pff grammar it's a stylistic thing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> straight eyes?
<Shamroc> oh oh oh Shizuka...can i has cookie?
<Phase4> 00,02and the walking one looks like a reskin of rainbow dash
<xxMoopyxx> Well it says bronystate we are currently experiencing technnical difficulties
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"We are currently experiencing technical difficulties."
<Shizuka> 13i would lowercase "bronystate" if we branded that way
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, lol, true
<Shizuka> 13you two are close
<Shizuka> 13but why is that rage inducing
*SpadeMagnes[R] shrugs
<xmasskills> oh mai
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lolololololollolol
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, walking one isnt walleyed?
<owlicious> Shizuka: it doesn't have enough derpy
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Shizuka> 13i am probably in the wrong crowd here... reddit would see it before i finished the post
<CrimsonPhoenix> but reddit is stupid
<RaveBrony> Oh snap, just refreshed! I LOVE this "technical difficulties" screen!! Dont fix the stream :then :$
<xxMoopyxx> are you guys still seeing it on screen here?
<owlicious> it doesn't look like comic sans, though
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Well, Derpy isn't even walleyed all the time.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and 4chan is the one that rage the most
<Shizuka> 13owlicious sees it~
*Shizuka 13gives owlicious a cookie~
<Phase4> 00,02no muffins?
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Shizuka> 13comic sans
<Kencolt> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: AHe's not so in the show either.
<owlicious> oh. That was it?
*SpadeMagnes[R] flips a table
<TheRareP0N3> SO MUCH COLOUR TO THE CHAT.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So what.
<hen3ry> who cares
<xxMoopyxx> hey ponies47 you here man
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats so rage inducing about comic sans?
*d3rb flips out
<owlicious> I have forgotten my hatred of that font
<Phase4> 00,02lolfonts
<Shizuka> 13i wanted to use mead bold for it but comic sans felt more properly derpy to me
<hen3ry> it's readable, that's all that matters
<CrimsonPhoenix> comic sans...
<Shizuka> 13come to think of it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who cares about Comic Sans?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh wow I forgot about that
<Vordox> Woot? Tech Diffs?
<Shizuka> 13"BronyState" should be in Papyrus
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<RaveBrony> :D
<Shizuka> 13but that would be too obvious
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It should be in Curlz MT.
<d3rb> comic sans killed my dogs and stole my car
<Phase4> 00,02i dont get the comic sans rage
<Shizuka> 13ok what's the other issue in the video
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: No, wingdings
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Celestia (The MLP font).
<Sumica> 00,10Font rage is shortbus specal
<Shizuka> 13it's a bit more subtle but sticks way out to me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol SpadeMagnes[R]
<Phase4> 00,02entire thing should be in windings
<RaveBrony> Oh is the stream whats being discussed atm? :o
<DashieMusic2> what? its a youtube video?
<Kencolt> Which is preferable to killing your car and stealing your dogs.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> RaveBrony, eeyup
<RaveBrony> Ah :)
<Shizuka> 13a muffin to the silly filly who spots the other issue with this video
<xxMoopyxx> ok i think i should back out and come back in i think
<Dumorimasoddaa> Yup
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: theres only 1 derpy
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<PsychoticDoc> im ok with this technical difficulty video
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno the shadow on her wing ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is so rage inducing about conic sans?
<owlicious> okay, so it isn't the new derpy, the wrong cutie mark, or the different tail colour, or the gravity
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, the lack of muffins?
<Phase4> 00,02no scrunchy face?
<Shizuka> 13every hint i can think of would give it away..
<xxMoopyxx> hang on a minute here
<otakon> NO MUFFINS?
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I tried looking for a problem with the walk cycle. I noticed none so far.
<otakon> Shizuka: JUST TELL US!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> straight eyes?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: the cutie mark is blue
<Shizuka> 13it was an issue i couldn't solve in vegas, was introduced in the render process and i don't know how
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We isnt capitalised?
<superretroworld> derpys eyes must hurt by now
<Shizuka> 13actually that walk cycle i spent a good half hour tweaking to be perfect
<xxMoopyxx> ok it says the same thing
<RaveBrony> Derpys hair isnt falling even tho shes upside down? O.o
<otakon> Shizuka: just look up a tutorial or I don't know..ASK SOMEONE HERE! Someon must know how to use vegas.
<hen3ry> the walk cycle is nice
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, walking derpy only has one wing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The skip in the eye animation?
*Shizuka 13gives Nittany_Discord a muffin :3
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> No spacing between Brony and State?
<otakon> panda-homework: you know how to use Vegas?
<RaveBrony> Aw hell!
<Kencolt> Is it the fact that her pupils get clipped in one eyes where they don't in the show?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DAMMIT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes!
<RaveBrony> I noticed that awhile ago! :D
*SpadeMagnes[R] sets fire to the chat
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs muffin
<otakon> I just saw that
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so nittany gets a muffin for the skip
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> but i dont get one for stating the cutie mark is blue?
*otakon has his OWN muffin
<Shizuka> 13the gif was perfectly looped but for some reason it introduced three skips in rendering
*otakon noms upon HIS muffin
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it weird to have a purple window color and a twilight chrome theme?
<DB_Brony> If i can read it, i don't care about font too much
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya
<Shizuka> 13my original idea was to have the walking derpy be the transition point for the quotes, but couldn't get the fades to cooperate
*Kencolt has no muffin. But he has a burrito. Which is good enough for him. It has beans.
<RaveBrony> :\
<Shizuka> 13all the fades were too fast for it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Rain bow dah
<xxMoopyxx> Hey what about the other ponies in the theater chatroom does it say the same thing to?
<hen3ry> we all see the same thing, not necessarilly at the exact same time
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Say hello to Mine Turtle
<panda-homework> otakon yeah? Whats up?
<Shizuka> 13if i were doing it in after effects i probably could have pulled it off, but i threw the thing together in like an hour and a half
<otakon> panda-homework: do you know how to use Vegas?
<PsychoticDoc> so whats with the cutiemark being off?
<panda-homework> otakon eeyup ^-^ whats up
<otakon> Shizuka: ask panda-homework
<Shizuka> 13the cutie mark being the wrong color is just an artifact from the gif i used
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws a dragon into the chatroom
<xxMoopyxx> well im going to all the mane 6 ponies in theater chatroom and see if it says the same thing to
<PsychoticDoc> oh, that sucks
<hen3ry> my first guess was almost gonna be "upsidedown Derpy has Rarity's cutie mark" then I looked closer
<RaveBrony> I wish i knew how to do animations and stuff.... :\
<otakon> panda-homework: she has issues with the Derpy eyes in the animation, she doesn't know how to get rid of that frame skip
<xxMoopyxx> Brb guys
<RaveBrony> i wouldve made my OC desktop pony a long time ago... :(
<owlicious> I just don't know what went wrong
<panda-homework> otakon who has the issues?
<Shizuka> 13nah it's that the source gif was perfectly looped, but after the render somehow there were skips introduced
<otakon> panda-homework: Shizuka does
<panda-homework> otakon sorry... im on my phone...
<RaveBrony> In some parts the eyes skip to the beat...so i thot it was intentional :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what caused the stream to die?
<otakon> panda-homework: oh, well it might have to wait then I don't think you can help her with it on the phone.
<panda-homework> Shizuka hm? Vegas giving you problems?
<Shizuka> 13made this video in january, was problems then :3
<Shizuka> 13it's only a problem for me... and all of you now that you know the eyes skip
<sub06905> dem technical difficulties :D
<Shizuka> 13YOU CAN NEVER UNSEE IT
<panda-homework> Shizuka haha then why is otakon tellin me now xD
<otakon> Shizuka: sure we can
<otakon> okay I lied
<Kencolt> Shizuka: Other obvious lines are... "Technical difficulties indeed! There are no muffins here." "We're doing everything we can to fix the problem... but we just don't know what went wrong." "I can't read this. Who wrote this upside down, anyway?"
<otakon> GODDAMMIT
<panda-homework> Nevr seen it in the first place Shizuka
<otakon> Kencolt: Are you okay stream?
<sub06905> Derpy is now best pony
<otakon> Anthing I can do to help?
<Kencolt> otakon: Mine is fine.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I honestly never noticed it until it was pointed out. But indeed, I can't unsee it.
<otakon> Kencolt: no no, FOR THE LINES
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: Well, as i said earlier, at many parts the eyes skip to the beat. so i thot it was intended :o
<hen3ry> And an upsidedown "There, that's better! I helped!"
<Shizuka> 13there is that
<Shizuka> 13is mostly why i didn't go back to make it more perfect
<Kencolt> Shizuka: I kind of like the second one myself, if I do say so.
<sub06905> this is youtube video :D
<Kencolt> otakon: Oh, of course.
<panda-homework> otakon oh well... the problem is solved... kinda... haha ^-^
<RaveBrony> I love them both! The railings one is TOO funny! :D and this one is awesome :P
<xxMoopyxx> ok i just checked the roomlist it all says the same thing
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/nKj61.jpg
<otakon> panda-homework: well, just thought I'd ask is all. You're one of the few here I know for sure to have editing experience
<Shamroc> xxMoopyxx...well then read it and wait for the problem to get fixed...damn
<panda-homework> otakon ^-^
<xxMoopyxx> sorry bro im not trying to be mean to you jeeze
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well I hope my computer isnt infected with the virus
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Kencolt> Anyhow, Shizuka , if you like any of those pathetic gags (except the second one which I think is pretty clever) feel free when and if you expand it.
<sub06905> what virus?
<otakon> Derpy Line! I know what's wrong, there are no muffins!
<owlicious> Wait, who here is from alaska?
<Shizuka> 13maybe next month i'll get back on the intermission project
<otakon> Shizuka: well, do it when you can
<Shizuka> 13my artistic creative side is pretty much burnt out after the award show
<otakon> goddammit I really should be in bed
<sub06905> this music
<sub06905> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can I help? I don't have Vegas, though :<
<otakon> but I'm waiting for something very importatn
<Shizuka> 13analytical creative wants to go back to building the enigma machine in wiremod/gmod but i'm on my third attempt..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> otakon: disregard sleep, aquire ponies
<xxMoopyxx> Heh i love this music while were waiting
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: PIRATE
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: it's something serious I'm waiting for
<otakon> A'RRR MATEY!
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, rendering intermission preview two, a 15 minute video, took an hour
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I fixed my Firefox
<RaveBrony> I have a massive headache, but i have to get Flare's picture done... x_x
<panda-homework> Shizuka uh.... if you ever need help with vegas... you can alwas ask me ^-^
<Shizuka> 13BUT
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HUZZAH!
<Reikim> This is...a disturbing game.
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're trying to code the Enigma machine? Do you have the algorithms?
<Shizuka> 13if i left out the countdown in the corner, it took 16 minutes
<Shizuka> 13yup
<otakon> :)
<Dumorimasoddaa> Bah
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details
<panda-homework> Shizuka settings were you using??
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's not the most
<panda-homework> What*
<otakon> Shizuka: so wait. WHY are you making a virtual Enigma Machine?
<Shizuka> 13was outputting 640x480, the rest were tailored towards my usual 720p out
<xxMoopyxx> Heh this music sounds like main menu lobby theater
<Reikim> I don't generally play disturbing games, so to me it's a shock.
<Shizuka> 13but it took so much longer with that timer cause the timer was its own video
<Kencolt> OK... this is all so very nice and technical... I guess I'll duck out, since I'm no good with nice and technical these days.
<Shizuka> 13and it's chroma keying the whole time
<xxMoopyxx> like lounge lobby music
<Shizuka> 13http://mckoss.com/Crypto/Enigma.htm i played with this in high school
<Shizuka> 13otakon: because i can
<panda-homework> Shizuka hm... and that took an hour?? And oh! Chroma keyer.... yeah... it does that.
<Shizuka> 13yep
<otakon> Shizuka: like ANY true adventurer would say!
<Shizuka> 13technically chroma key and then inverted, since the timecode is white on black
<otakon> BECAUSE I CAN GODDAMMIT!
<Shizuka> 13and i needed black on white
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well good night
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >watching an episode of MST3K
*otakon jumps off a cliff "ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!!!"
<otakon> night SpadeMagnes[R] sleep well
<Shizuka> 13so yeah each set of frames took much longer with the timer active
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >female asian character is called Sumica
<owlicious> good night everypony. I'm off to destroy the oatmeal factory
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys I got something interesting that some of you would love http://imgur.com/a/3klDf#1
<otakon> night owlicious sleep ...eh destroy well
<Reikim> On the plus side, I feel no remorse killing the sick bastards in this game.
<owlicious> crush swag
<RaveBrony> Cya owlicious :P
<Sumica> 00,10wuh huh?
<Shizuka> 13anyway re enigma machine, i got halfway through it before encountering a bug with wiremod, at least i think
<panda-homework> Shizuka hm... well you realize that if you rendered both at separate times and used overlay, it wouldnt have taken as long...
<sub06905> wait the stream is youtube!? :o
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again the beginner artist are probably absent
<owlicious> eyup.
<otakon> sub06905: eeyup
<xxMoopyxx> wait it is
<otakon> I wonder if I could locally embed another video though?
<owlicious> you could.
<otakon> bc that would be awesome
<otakon> I don't know how
<xxMoopyxx> wait let me go check
<otakon> I'm embed illiterate
<Shizuka> 13it was the best way i could think of, render a 20 minute video of a timecode in the corner (masked out so it's only minutes and seconds) on a black background so i just invert and chroma to use in the intermission
<otakon> brb
<Shamroc> Shizuka: if i knew how wiremod worked id be more than happy to help..
<Dumorimasoddaa> Lol
<Shizuka> 13the intermission layers go base white > picture > fade mask > logo > quote text > subtitle text > timer
<xxMoopyxx> YouTube looks fine to me
<panda-homework> Shizuka hehe ^-^ no worries, ive made similar mistakes. So, you had about 8 tracks, including the music, no?
<Shizuka> 13timer over everything in case i wanted to do a fourth wall gag with pinkie at some point
<Shizuka> 13i think there were two or three tracks for music, mostly for shizu-style mixing
<Shizuka> 13s/were/are
<Shizuka> 13first song in track 1, second song in track 2 for crossfading, third song back on track 1 and so on
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/okRtj
<xxMoopyxx> Did derpy walked out of the chatroom coming from the right side?
<Shizuka> 13intermission is 15 minutes long broken into 30 slides of 30 seconds each
<Reikim> So Tenenbaum threw me what looks like a plasmid.
<xxMoopyxx> ya she did
<Reikim> How do I equip it?
<Shizuka> 13of those i have content for i think four
<panda-homework> Ah! Hm... Shizuka, that seemed like a chore and a half! Not sure much i could optimize that, in terms of render speed and quality.
<Reikim> What the heck was it anyway?
<sub06905> let's all go the lobby!
<xxMoopyxx> ok
<Shizuka> 13when it comes time that the intermission 2.0 is ready for render i'd just do it overnight :3
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think its auto equpied for that one
<xxMoopyxx> Hey derpy stop walking out of the chatroom
<RaveBrony> :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> should be the one that lets you harvest from the sisters
<RaveBrony> It is indeed better than no stream! :)
<Shizuka> 13the award show was fun *liarjack.avi*
<VioletGreySha> morning ponies
<Ninjazz> Shizuka, didn't we see you test it out on stream one day? I assumed it was ready for use. :S
<xxMoopyxx> morning
<RaveBrony> Hiya VioletGreySha :P
<sub06905> derpy is best intermission
<Shizuka> 13nah that's just my storyboarding/framework
<Reikim> Aha
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<panda-homework> Shizuka hehe sounds like a plan. Oh! You know you could make it quicker with one special trick :3c
<Reikim> I chose to rescue, because, well...
<superretroworld> this music is so relaxing
<RaveBrony> What? O>o
<sub06905> ello VioletGreySha
<Reikim> I can't kill little girls.
<xxMoopyxx> i know right
<Shizuka> 13for instance the slide about railings i didn't follow at all, that of course resulted in the railings intermission i use to kick off my video streams
<Ninjazz> Ah, man... Would love to see it used though, that one part where the music transitions to the other part was amazing.
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: THat one is great too :D
<VioletGreySha> sub06905 RaveBrony ohai
<Shizuka> 13ja by the bay to starsfull is probably one of my best transitions
<Applejackz> Simcity music ;)
<Ninjazz> Indeed!
<RaveBrony> Hmm?
<Shizuka> 13though Where The Streets Have No Name into Saihate is my best
<sub06905> Maxis has best music
<xxMoopyxx> hey everypony lets all relax of this amazing music that were hearing right now
*Ninjazz still says that one part was probably his favorite
<Shizuka> 13second place is either the first pair of tracks on cathedral mix i or the mashup i did of the Frozen Synapse RED OST and Oh Sherrie a couple weeks ago
<panda-homework> Shizuka hehe, you're quite the transitionary genius huh? ^-^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I chose kill for them my first time through, but I was just leaving angsty teenager days when the game came out
<Ninjazz> panda-homework, she is.
<Reikim> Even if they're little monsters, I just can't kill them.
<Ninjazz> Grrrr. Now I gotta look up those videos.
<xxMoopyxx> this is pretty good music
<Shizuka> 13Re-Development here is one of the longest tracks on the SimCity 4 OST which is why i used it
<Shizuka> 13if you're going to have a video up to kill time while a stream is repaired, better make it long
<Applejackz> Dang now i feel like playing SC4 again...
<xxMoopyxx> yeah make it long to
<RX-78-SweetieBot> you actually get more gene moneys if you choose to save them overall due to rewards for saving them
<panda-homework> Well... i best go back to homework ^-^
<sub06905> music from any sims is relaxing
<Shizuka> 13it's also obviously relaxing, a few of the other ones i considered were either too repetitive or got too intense midway
<Reikim> Still, it's a moral thing.
<sub06905> :$
<Reikim> Gah, now I have to kill a Big Daddy. Dammit.
<xxMoopyxx> whats the music called i want to go look it up on youtube
<Shizuka> 13http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CF3464B4CD08038
<Reikim> How to go about it...?
<Shizuka> 13this is Re-Development off the SimCity 4 OST
<xxMoopyxx> i mean the name of it
<sub06905> i just love that derpy walking across the screen :)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Set up traps
<RX-78-SweetieBot> have a plan
<Shizuka> 13apparently by Jerry Martin, at least according to youtube's copyright whining
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I noticed just now that this is straight off of Youtube. Not on a streaming site or anything.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> nuke it with the best shit you got
<RX-78-SweetieBot> dont miss
<Shizuka> 13yep we can embed youtube videos, but they won't sync
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/okRtj
<Sumica> 00,10Simcity 4 was good but made me sad in that disasters were no longer random.
<Shizuka> 13you'll always refresh to the start of the video/playlist
<xxMoopyxx> i just wanted to go type it in it sounds so good
<sub06905> what is wrong with stream anyways?
<Irish_Pony> night all :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RX-78-SweetieBot: her legs look weird o_o
<sub06905> night Irish_Pony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ-QLl5qjLg random music
<Sumica> 00,10noting is wrong with it othere then no streamer atm.
<Shizuka> 13maybe we should use my bronystate playlist for the offline stream... though i would want some flag visible somewhere that says "we are offline"
<Starlight_Phoenix> Hi everypony. Just got here. What are you guys streaming?
<Reikim> Thanks for the advice. :|
<owlicious> nothing
<sub06905> Shizuka: u should :$
<Ninjazz> Agreed.
<Sumica> 00,10probably should set it back to mips
<xxMoopyxx> hey some pony check ibrony website go into the chatroom and see if its still silenced in there real quick
<sub06905> ello Starlight_Phoenix
<Starlight_Phoenix> Hey there sub06905
<Sumica> 00,10not so suttle advertising xxMoopyxx?
<xxMoopyxx> what do you mean by that?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> If you have armor piercing ammo for guns save them up for big daddy fights
<Applejackz> Hey for the person who wanted the like to the music here it is : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yskny4J01V0
<RX-78-SweetieBot> electric buck for the shotgun also helps for stunning them so you can reposition
<Ninjazz> It helps if you ask permission to do that stuff.
<Reikim> Hm
<xxMoopyxx> like what kind of stuff?
<Reikim> Really, REALLY doesn't help that the Little Sister is just plain bleedin' adorable.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh that's why there was a simcity discussion earlier
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/66klKlUtJPI?t=4m30s those looking for the best transition ever should look here
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Well, think of it that you are fighting the big daddies so you can cure the sisters.
<xxMoopyxx> just go into there chatroom just say something in there if they say anything
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka, any chance that your video will include some Sims music?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I mean the original sims
<Shizuka> 13nope don't have sims OST
<Shizuka> 13only simcity 4
<CrimsonPhoenix> dangit
<Reikim> Dammit, bastard just bashed the hell out of me.
<Jaketehsnake> Allo All.
<Shizuka> 13the intermission is pretty much set music-wise, still debating how to handle the area after starsfull though
<Ninjazz> Serriously is your best transition, Shizu.
<Sumica> 00,10which Sims OST did you want?
<xxMoopyxx> ask them if they still have me muted in that
<CrimsonPhoenix> each time I listen to buy mode of sims I get chills of nostalgia everywhere
<Pinkie_Kittie> Hey Everypony!
<Texasboykc09> hello everypony
<Shizuka> 13there's just enough time for the TechnoMix we use from civ 3 but like two or three minutes left
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, I just wondered if there would be any Sims music in Shizuka videos
<Shizuka> 13have very few tracks at my disposal to fill that
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want to play sims now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> how is sims fun?
<CrimsonPhoenix> THE ORIGINAL ONE
<Shizuka> 13the sims unseated Myst as the best selling pc game ever
<Shizuka> 13makes me sad
<CrimsonPhoenix> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, I can make a floating house in sims
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya but why is it fun?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, A FLOATING HOUSE
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOW IS THAT NOT FUN
<Shizuka> 13http://soundcloud.com/kamishizuka/parting-drinks this is what happens when shizu can't unhear a song in another
<Reikim> ...You're right, it's easier if I remember that I'm saving them.
<coastercrutch> :)
<Dovah> :|
<CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously though
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's killing the sims that's fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> and making your dream house
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's it
<XAX> Phase4: :D?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai XAX
<Phase4> 00,02gona reboot soon
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, :(
<Phase4> 00,02myst > sims
<Shizuka> 13<33
<Shizuka> 13myst is the reason we got games on CD
<Reikim> Right, done with that for now, and hopefully I won't have nightmares as a result.
<Shizuka> 13i could probably run my potpourri playlist for a while
<Shizuka> 13asuka might put up with that..
<Phase4> 00,02asuka needs a new cooler
<Reikim> Sims has no story. Case in point.
<Phase4> 00,02laptop right?
<Shizuka> 13desktop
<Shizuka> 13tower
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Reikim: yup
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Shizuka> 13but sumica can tell you since he has the same desk as me, there's no ventilation
<Phase4> 00,02i assume its not dust
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Shizuka> 13nah downstairs in a major walkway with two dogs in summer
<Phase4> 00,02cut a hole in the back?
<Shizuka> 13it's probably a LOT of dust
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i had to do alot of work with mine to keep the temp in the 60's
<Phase4> 00,02its usualy quite hard to make towers overheat unless you have a gtx480 or something
<Shizuka> 13she's idling at 56C now
<Phase4> 00,02those buggers ran at 90c
<Shizuka> 13about where she's been since summer started
<Shizuka> 13streaming immediately pushes to the 70-75C range
<Reikim> All these professional gaming PCs O__O I feel like such a newbie.
<Shizuka> 1380 if i'm trying to do Source
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, I got a gtx470
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, have you tried taking the side of the case off?
<Phase4> 00,02should help a little
<Shizuka> 13not entirely sure if i can
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, nice and toasty isnt it
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13obviously i can
<Shizuka> 13but with where it is i wouldn't really want to
<Shizuka> 13would just attract a lot more dust
<Phase4> 00,02the 470 ran at about 80 iirc, has less active silicon than the 480
<Shizuka> 13GPU hovers around 70C all the time for me, from what speedfan tells me
<Reikim> Less active silicon?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, realy should open it and get the dust out
<d3rb|drawing> ^ dust kills
<Shizuka> 13yeah.. just been too hot this week to disassemble my desk
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, not sure what the proper term is, they disable ~100 out of ~500 cores iir
<Phase4> 00,02iirc'
<Phase4> 00,02something like 386 vs 480, cant remember
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The 470 is infamous for running hot IIRC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the one I have.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/7Yy6q.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02friend of mine has a 480, it ran at 90
<Shizuka> 13that's my world from a couple months ago
<Sumica> 00,10yeah that was why I said boxfan+3m airfilter Shizuka
<Reikim> Looks like a pretty nice world.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well I do have an antec case, I can't remember the full name of it though
<CrimsonPhoenix> It has like 5 fans?
<Cobellanez> Goodnight everyone
<hen3ry> troll symmetry... grr.
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, easiest way to clear dust is those compressed air cans they sell and places, no where near a store though so i disasemble and blow
<Shizuka> 13yeah..
<Phase4> 00,02probably very bad for my lungs
<otakon> night Cobellanez sleep well
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: that chair!! Where did you get it and for how much!? o.o it looks like a nice comfy chair!
<Shizuka> 13have a canned air here, still just have to disassemble my desk to pull asuka out
<Phase4> 00,02night Cobellanez
<Sumica> 00,10I dont trust caned air.
<Shizuka> 13only accessible from the back, which is of course a nightmare of cables and celestia knows what else has set up shop back there
<Sumica> 00,10would rather use the small vac and a paintbrush
<Phase4> 00,02...that probably works better actually
<d3rb|drawing> wouldnt you need to worry about static Sumica ?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure why i never thought of it
<Phase4> 00,02dust is less of a problem where i am though, much larger problem is running out of thermal paste
<Sumica> 00,10not if you ground your self on the case.
<Shizuka> 13i'd use canned air and have a vacuum nearby
<Shizuka> 13use air to blow the dust up, vacuum to pick it up in air
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, the thing under your monitor, modem?
<Shizuka> 13glorified power strip
<RaveBrony> Ugh, well ive got to head to bed. Good night everypony! Take care and have fun :)
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/HSYGY.jpg can see better here
<d3rb|drawing> take it easy RaveBrony
<Shizuka> 13modem is hiding behind the dr pepper and coaster on the left
<otakon> ngiht RaveBrony sleep well
<Sumica> 00,10I find the dust here to be kinda sticky so the brush woorks better at geting the goop off the hot componets
<CriticKitten> Shiny.
<Phase4> 00,02clearly it needs more buttons
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<otakon> Shizuka: needs cleaning
<Shizuka> 13i like it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya theres a lot of dust on the desk o_o
<Shizuka> 13yeah everything needs dusting
<Phase4> 00,02does look usefull actually, bit overkill imho
<Shizuka> 13it's pretty old
<Shizuka> 13i assume it's as big as it is cause it's supposed to support a CRT
<Shizuka> 13and it did for a few years til i finally got the main screen
<Phase4> 00,02explains the colour scheme
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/tv2UA.jpg here's december
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> O_O
<Xaiden> Hey anyone know where I can find someone who can draw a picture for me?
<Shizuka> 13back when one of the two tracklights overhead worked
<Shizuka> 13now they're both dead and i probably burnt the junction box
<Xaiden> I'm writing a story and I need some custom art for the Cover
<Shizuka> 13RaveBrony: office depot i think, was their display model
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> whats the story?
<Shizuka> 13it's slowly falling apart, think it's a little over a year and a half old now
<Xaiden> Haven't published it yet but it's about Changelings and that sort
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ah
<xxMoopyxx> So im guessing bronystate and the stream is dead now?
<Shizuka> 13not sure if i want to stream potpourri playlist or not
<xxMoopyxx> hmmmm
<Xaiden> I find them the easiest to write about since there's so little actually known about them, you get a lot of elbow room to make up stuff
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wishes for a motherboard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01or a working computer
<Xaiden> Lol
<Xaiden> So anyone know where I could find a person to do a cover art picture?
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG wishes to be a streamer :3
<Shizuka> 13there i go looking through my imgur library again... look the fifth best thing i ever built http://imgur.com/a/b1uJ6#0
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: dayum
<Xaiden> I've built so much shit in Minecraft
<Shizuka> 13eventually we had a huge swirling cloud layer at the top a la episode one
<xxMoopyxx> Well i have the DUKE NUKEM forever game going so i'll just wait untill the stream is up and going i'll come back to the screen when it does ok
<Shizuka> 13i had help on that part, but the clouds you see there were me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xxMoopyxx: spoiler alert aliens invade the earth
<Shizuka> 13wonder if either of the wom remnants would have that citybuild saved still
<xxMoopyxx> Heh yeah right
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: good old G11 darn we got teh same keyboard and mouse lol
<Shizuka> 13i want to upgrade to the G510 but $100
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I made a Saturn 5 replica and an incomplete model of Yellowstone in WoM.
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: g11 is still cool
<Shizuka> 13indeed
<Shizuka> 1318 macro keys, perfect for binding shortcuts for winamp at the bottom and launchers on the rest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a PoS keyboard and mouse.
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: i always set chat spamm on it
<Reikim> Hm? I leave for five minutes and suddenly we're bragging about Minecraft?

<Reikim> Shizu, I find that hilarious.
<Sumica> 00,10big shock Snaper down again.
<VioletGreySha> Shizuka: lawl
<Shizuka> 13if i weren't terrible at it and it weren't so finicky on win7 i'd try streaming lode runner
<Shamroc> uhh whut
<Reikim> I have that game. It's oodles of fun.
<Shizuka> 13it was technically my first video game
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> whats lode runner?
<Reikim> :O
<xxMoopyxx> ok hang on im going to change my nickname and see if it fits
<Shizuka> 13riven was the first time i actually paid attention though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What is up with Screensnapr?
<Shizuka> 13screensnapr has been really flaky for a couple months
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Well, if you ever do stream Lode Runner, I'll make sure to be around. But for now, night everyone.
<shmoopy> ok so what do you guys think
<Shamroc> shmoopy...the name reminds me of someone i truley dislike..
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> night Reikim

<Shamroc> Shizuka: 100% improvised with tnt
<Rain> lol
<Shizuka> 13like i say in the video, i plopped down a portal once just to see what would happen, turned out the exit point was so cool i just had to build something
<Shizuka> 13the rest was all based around building pillars at regular intervals
<Shizuka> 13the tavern is my favorite though
<Eddmario> Here's mine BTW: http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/1/24072000/ngbbs4ff92800b0024.jpg

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not my laptop wallpaper.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> wat is it?
<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord No, they haven't
<Eddmario> Since there's a good chunk of the mods on, any of you feel like streaming? I'll give a muffin to the first person who does
<Phase4> 00,02i keep pressing ctrl+alt+left/right because on linux it switches desktop
<Phase4> 00,02on windows, the intel gpu drivers use it for rotating the screen
<Eddmario> Phase_4 You use Linux? What is this, the 70s?
<Phase4> 00,02celestia only knows why, its insanely anoying
<Phase4> 00,02Eddmario, you say that, yet compiz :P
<Shizuka> 13i found i can't use my winamp shortcuts during Source as much as i used to now that i have two monitors
<Shizuka> 13my next track macro apparently contains the "move this window to the other screen and do it in such a way it can't go back" shortcut when i'm moving forward

<Eddmario> Have you read "Lessons Learned" yet sub06905?
<sub06905> i dont think so
<Zombie_Brony> after reading "Rainbow Factory", I've tried to avoid any and all gore fics
<sub06905> ive read Momma Fluttershy -_-''
<sub06905> so disturbing
<Eddmario> If you want a good laugh, go read it. It's on Fimfiction.

<Zombie_Brony> this says a thousand words http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
<Eddmario> Hey, shouldn't you go reading that fic I just gave you the link to?
<Eddmario> Zombie_Brony At least you didn't link to the Faded website.

<Eddmario> Don't forget to delete System 32
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i'd prefer there be something around
<Shamroc> Shizuka: oh yeah excess island shizu..

<Zombie_Brony> Shamroc that's what I was gonna say
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4 needs a cutie mark.
<Shizuka> 13actually since i'll probably just be doing enigma phase could host and ping wouldn't matter much for me
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, point is i will spaz physics :/
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Garry's mod is always about spazzing physics
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol
<Shizuka> 13source engine why you load so slow
<seatsea> huge delay between chat and video
<Zombie_Brony> what are physics?
<Shamroc> iunno
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i can start a server here
<Mutterguy> a fair repesentation of phase's rockets half the time
<Phase4> 00,02map?
<Eddmario> My cutie mark is a sword. The sword has Luna, Celestia, and Cadence's cutie marks on it. There's also the shield from Shining Armor's cutie mark behind it, and the whole thing is surrounded by the cutie marks of the Mane 6.
<Mutterguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b4WzWFKQ20&feature=youtu.be&t=8m4s <Top gear
<Texasboykc09> hello phase4
<XAX> Phase4: we should play Fretta at some point, seeing you got CSS.
<Shizuka> 13go to toybox and find gm_excess_island
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's excessive Eddmario.
<Lunar_Brony> hi Texasboykc09
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: ^^^^^^^^
<Phase4> 00,02have to change port mappings
<hen3ry> very excessive
<Phase4> 00,02dedicated dont have this map
<Shizuka> 13you will need the map anyway
<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord You're just jealous yours isn't that epid
<Shizuka> 13i think it's too big for me to autosend
<Phase4> 00,02probably a good idea to use this machine anyway
<Phase4> 00,02the one the dedicated is on isnt exactly powerfull
*Lunar_Brony yawns
<Shizuka> 13i can start and have server up in a minute
<Eddmario> Phase, the stream is a few seconds behind
<hen3ry> thats normal, Eddmario
<Shizuka> 13stream is always a few seconds behind
<CrimsonPhoenix> So Derpyhoovenews caught the Hasbro Q&A video but not EQD
<hen3ry> there's a buffer
<Shizuka> 13*always*
<Shamroc> moop
<sub06905> cisco
<CrimsonPhoenix> YEAH FOR DHN
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Mutterguy> it was 4 mins beind once
<Shizuka> 13CrimsonPhoenix: we sent to EQD after DHN, we wanted them to have the story first
<Phase4> 00,02should open
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh gosh
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love you Bronystate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't need a complicated CM. Just a representative one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but why that decision?
<hen3ry> I wonder how high the highest mountains on minmus actually are...
<Shizuka> 13EQD have been jerks to us before
<seatsea> how did he get that pony on the side?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh wow
<Eddmario> So, I take it since flutterguy posted a youtube link during stream, we're allowed one youtube link per stream? In that case, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93kBPeH1w8c
<sub06905> desktop ponies
<Lunar_Brony> seatsea it's an OC Desktop Pony
<seatsea> ok thanks
<Phase4> 00,02mfw dhn lags firefox
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No video links during stream for anyone.
<Shizuka> 13gmod why you so slow...
<Phase4> 00,02no obvious reason why
<Eddmario> Phase, you need to go get a persona for FireFox
<Phase4> 00,02ok, should work
<Phase4> 00,02ports are fowarded

<Ninjazz> Trust me, man. Watching ponies on TV is overated.
<Ninjazz> YouTube and local copies is where it's at.
<Kammerjunk> Stormman3100: Nah. Even if I did, I'd still download both series in at 720p or 1080p.
<Ghosties> 04Why watch ponies on TV when you can watch here at BronyState :P
<Starflash> Watching dubbed ponies is more overrated
<Starflash> except for french dub, that's just hilarious
<Stormman3100> @Ghosties does make a point

<Cypresswolf> :) G Mod - that reminds me...*looks around*...fluttercry isnt here - anyway, there's an SCP 173for this :) works the same as the game - look away and it follows you
<Flyboy> so guys
<Flyboy> what did you think of my pinkiemobile
<Flyboy> aka, a pod with 50 pink ballons on it
<Stormman3100> I've done nothing but spray my back with aloe all day
<hen3ry> needed more pedal power
<hen3ry> and a forward mounted party cannon
<Cypresswolf> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173 - this is SCP 173 for those who dont know what Im talking about :)
<hen3ry> because artillery is always good
<Ghosties> 04Be warned, SCP is supposed to be scary as fuck
<Rain> ^
<Cypresswolf> YES!
<Ninjazz> Double Yes.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> LOL
<Rain> made me actually get up from comp with my arms shaking
<Ninjazz> I think the staircase one is the worse one.
<Ghosties> 04Sooooo if I am streaming by the time Halloween rolls around, you better believe I'll be streaming a blind playthrough of the game for you guys :)
<Stormman3100> I was livestreaming that game and broke my monitor. LIVE xD
<Ninjazz> Ghosties... oh shit. >_<
<Cypresswolf> 87 - the stairway brought me to tears
<Ghosties> 04I think you guys would have fun, yeah?
<Stormman3100> I fear quit 087 lol
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ I'm looking forward that
<Ninjazz> Define "fun". >_<
<Starflash> SCP? :O
<Ghosties> 04You know, fun. Where you can derive excitement and an adrenaline rush from watching me play the game. AND, I'll hope to be doing it with my mic so you guys will be able to hear me talk
<Cypresswolf> *inhales as if to say something*.....nope, cant think of an accurate acronym to define it - SCP stands for Secure, Contain & Protect
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<GilDash> <--- What the hell is that? :D
<ACS13123> Hi GilDash
<GilDash> Good godesses, the chat's dead! :D
<ACS13123> GilDash: its GMod
<GilDash> ACS13123: I can see that... what I meant is what is that *thing* that was "flying"? :S
<ACS13123> GilDash: I have no idea
<Flyboy> probably the pinkiemobile
<hen3ry> It was pink baloons... and rockets.
<ACS13123> The chat is so ded...
<GilDash> This is hilarious. :D
<Flyboy> yep, thats the pinkiemobile
*GilDash join dashiesauce

<ninja_pony> lol hi everypony \o/
<Davedixon17> yup
*hen3ry cues 'taps'
<Cypresswolf> I played roller coaster 3 till I fell asleep in my chair - :) the Kerbals didnt have it near as bad as those who entered my park
<hen3ry> I'm sick of killing Kerbals for now... my shuttle is ticking me off.
<Cypresswolf> those RC people cant withstand one heck of a fall
<Cypresswolf> made one of those water raft rides where you hold onto a raft or mat and fall into a huge funnel that drops you in a pool - only the pool was a canyon that went down as deep as I could make it :D
<Kammerjunk> Senseless, mindless and GLORIOUS evil.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I actually still have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.
<Kammerjunk> I'm scared of Phase4's map right now.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Cypresswolf> :) I think Ill start a new park with a free ride right at the entrance - no exit leading back to the gate - and release a bunch of wild animals ^_^
<ACS13123> Phase4: Poot flying thing here
<Kammerjunk> Dopamine is telling me not to play Roller Coaster Tycoon.
<hen3ry> hi
<hen3ry> bah wrong window lol
<Kammerjunk> Heus, hen3ry.
<Cypresswolf> and I thought this had dinosaurs in it - need to get zoo tycoon for that - dinosaurs are statues :|
<Kammerjunk> Lol.
<derpy_pony> hey there :)
<derpy_pony> guess the movie stream is over by now...
<hen3ry> I might just be too tired to be online right now.
<ACS13123> Poot Teleport here
<derpy_pony> gravity gun stuff....
<ACS13123> Poot heavy here
<Kammerjunk> I really hate how Windows Explorer organises by name.
<ACS13123> Poot... what the fuck is THAT
<derpy_pony> someone broke the arena limit
<Kammerjunk> I absolutely despise it, in fact.
<derpy_pony> alphabetically?
<derpy_pony> don't see anything wrong there
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: No, it doesn't ignore words such as "the".
<derpy_pony> oh
<Cypresswolf> :O I just got a wonderful idea - if only I knew how to code
<derpy_pony> even windows allows scripts...bat files
<Stormman3100> I know some code, whats your idea? =P
<Kammerjunk> ...I used to know a bit of Java. I can't help.
<derpy_pony> doom and despise
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ SCP 173 but as a Mane 6 pony
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, what's SCP 173?
<Cypresswolf> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173
<derpy_pony> kammerjunk...good luck :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its a fun alpha game
<Kammerjunk> Looks artsy.
<derpy_pony> the background sound is a bit unadvantageous
<Stormman3100> Is that a REAL pic of the real thing? or wut
<Cypresswolf> Yep, thats it
<derpy_pony> seen this pic before
<Stormman3100> o.o
<derpy_pony> a few of the scp's are cool though...
<Kammerjunk> Oh. So I do have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3...
<Kammerjunk> ...In French.
<derpy_pony> mind control rat and stuff
<Cypresswolf> I forget which number, but there's an SCP that you cant even look at a picture of it - it finds you if you do
<Stormman3100> o.o
<derpy_pony> ^^
<Cypresswolf> I find that FAR scarier than 173
<derpy_pony> want
<derpy_pony> now!
<Starflash> Cypresswolf, so what IS SCP? a game or something?
<Stormman3100> I didn't wanna sleep anyway
<Stormman3100> Im really gonna have nightmares tonight xD
<Davedixon17> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-871
<Cypresswolf> Starflash: its a game - SCP stands for secure, contain, & protect
<derpy_pony> Starflash: amateur horror autors present a scenario

<Lil_B> well, looks like I came in in the right time XD
<Flyboy> what now then
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> well this was fun :3
<Cypresswolf> :) Stormman3100 that's the way to SCP
<Flyboy> what other games you got phase?
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf May i ask what SCP is exactly?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> a alpha staged game
<Stormman3100> awwww
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> http://scpcb.wordpress.com/
<Cypresswolf> AdamTheDuck: its a horror game
<Stormman3100> Dat derpy is cute =P
<GilDash> <--- /)_=
<GilDash> :D
<FipSaSLT> computer with win 95
<FipSaSLT> wow
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> wat
<FipSaSLT> sticker
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> LOL
<GilDash> To say a computer is never obsolete is a lie the moment you make it. :D
<Ghosties> 04Wow, you guys are still talking about SCP :P
<AdamTheDuck> looks...
<AdamTheDuck> kinda fun?
<Lil_B> yeah, "He keeps everything timey, wimey"
<GilDash> Ghosties: What the hay is SCP? :S
<AdamTheDuck> how do all these stories with the wiki links tie in with the game?
<Flyboy> yay
<Starflash> Ikr Ghosties
<Starflash> It is pretty interesting though :D
<Cypresswolf> Stormman3100: This next one is quite...detailed and the pic is quite creepy - ready?
<Flyboy> yup
<Ghosties> 04SCP stands for Secure, Contain, Protect and it's sort of a horror flash game? I think that's the right definition for it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> i think of it as Standard Containment Protocol
<Cypresswolf> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-610
<GilDash> Ghosties: Oh. Well, I've not been talking about it until now 'cause I've only just heard of it. :D
<alexxm> hey guys
<Starflash> Cypresswolf: Infect everything!!
<d3rb|drawing> hey alexxm , how are you?
<alexxm> hey d3rb|drawing i'm good how about you
<d3rb> yeah alright
<Cypresswolf> There's a really sad one about a horse that used to be a pegasis - somewhere betwee 1 and 999
<alexxm> Cypresswolf you talking about SCP
<Cypresswolf> yes
<alexxm> ok
<Cypresswolf> Found the scp description about the one you cant take a picture of - http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 - the Shy Guy
<Stormman3100> I suck at drawing, as you could see xD
<GilDash> ... You know you're in trouble when you semi-understand programming. :D
<Flutterswag> ELLO!

<Stormman3100> I screwed up my pony :'(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> how?
<Stormman3100> just chillin in paint chat
<Stormman3100> lol
<alexxm> Stormmman3100 what do you mean

<Phase4> 00,02unless
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Helloooooo Everypony
<alexxm> hey Winter_Shadowhooves hows your day been
<Winter_Shadowhooves> good
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what about yours?
<Phase4> 00,02stupid windows
<Phase4> 00,02this code would just work on linux
<shana> Phase4: can I help ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02:D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yay for linux
*Phase4 00,02hugs shana
<alexxm> it's been good for the 15 minutes i've been up Winter_Shadowhooves
<shana> aww :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> good to hear
<Phase4> 00,02shana, need to find the cairo renderer for windows
<Phase4> 00,02and then properly read this code
<Phase4> 00,02also want to look at adding error reporting
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Why do you need code when your drawing?
<Phase4> 00,02this kinda thing has random problems
<Phase4> 00,02Winter_Shadowhooves, i'm coding, not drawing
<Winter_Shadowhooves> oh
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what ae you coding?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> *are
<shana> Phase4: which python version do you have?
<shana> Phase4: this looks promising: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycairo
<Phase4> 00,02shana, 2.7 and 3.6 are both installed
<Phase4> 00,02that looks excelent
<Phase4> 00,02i think its 3.6
<Phase4> 00,02nope, 3.2
<Phase4> 00,02dat unknown time remaining
<shana> Phase4: well you first have to get a network dump, I used nc to do this but I don't know if I still have the script..
<Phase4> 00,02LOL
<Phase4> 00,02that site
<Phase4> 00,02its hosted on iis 6
<shana> network dump includes ALL drawing commands since a nuke
<shana> it's zlib compressed but it can be huge :D
<Phase4> 00,02hmm, could hack that with wireshark probably
<shana> Phase4: I've got an easier way
<Winter_Shadowhooves> dat hexadecimal string
<Phase4> 00,02easier is good
<shana> Phase4: lemme find somewhere to upload binary files..
<shana> ('login' message contains a 0 byte)
<Winter_Shadowhooves> technically, we could access your PC because we now know your IP
<Phase4> 00,02Winter_Shadowhooves, good luck
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I wouldnt be that mean
<shana> Winter_Shadowhooves: what is my ip :)
<Phase4> 00,02no, srsly, try
<Winter_Shadowhooves> err
<Phase4> 00,02i've got public-key only ssh, nginx and the paintchat
<TheRareP0N3> jeuss christ
<Winter_Shadowhooves> 118.somthing.something.somethinge etc
<Phase4> 00,02thats all you can access via that ip
<Phase4> 00,02118.209.113.128 :P
<d3rb> i got norton bitches, I AM INVINCIBLE
<TheRareP0N3> LOL NORTON.

<d3rb> oh god my computer is on fire!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> watch out guys. we have a badass over here
<GilDash> Norton?! :D
<TheRareP0N3> no no
<TheRareP0N3> it's like this
<GilDash> You might as well shoot your PC. :D
<shana> my ip is 127.28.211.21
<TheRareP0N3> \:O/ WATCH OUT GUYS, WE GOT A BADASS OVERHERE. \:O/
<Phase4> 00,02nmap time
<shana> <-- has the fastest ping!
<Cypresswolf> d3rb: I dont think thats what they mean by firewall
<Winter_Shadowhooves> the only thing I have to mess with IP`s is LOIC
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> good night Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02night Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i see webserver

<Phase4> 00,02dat localhost
<Winter_Shadowhooves> @ECHO OFF
<shana> sorry could not resist ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02127.* is local isnt it XD
<shana> yup
<Phase4> 00,02forgot that

<Phase4> 00,02allso i found out that nginx returns NOTHING but a 404
<shana> yeah most know that 127.0.0.1 is special :D
<Phase4> 00,02its odd

<Phase4> 00,02what
<Winter_Shadowhooves> this chat need s next line chat system
<GilDash> Wrek|Observiking|vac: I think he meant something like, "If there is more shit in your life then life, then your life is shit, else nothing."
<Winter_Shadowhooves> code is easier to read
<shana> Phase4: skype
<Phase4> 00,02shana, srsly?
<shana> Phase4: (iirc)
<Phase4> 00,02...WHY
<Wrek|Observiking|vac> but imagine that the < is underlined
<shana> Phase4: cause firewalls often allow https
<GilDash> Wrek|Observiking|vac: Okay, less than or equal to. :D
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, skype is listening on https
<shana> Phase4: I was as surprised as you are
<Phase4> 00,02how bizare
<shana> when I first found out
<Winter_Shadowhooves> @ECHO OFF :A DEL WINDOWS Y LOOP :B GOTO A LOOP
<Phase4> 00,02its listtening on https with udp
<shana> when I do my monthly nmap of the computers of my family :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> basic virus^
<alexxm> so what is Phase4 programming
<Phase4> 00,02and tcp
<shana> Phase4: skype has a lot of different methods to get around nat and firewalls
<Phase4> 00,02explains why it works at uni
<Phase4> 00,02Winter_Shadowhooves, lolnope
<GilDash> WindWhistler: What does that do? Delete windows? :S
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I just control my families internet. I can just feed all the internet to me
<Phase4> 00,02they finaly got around to making things not allways admin in vista
<Phase4> 00,02and made it allmost work in 7
<Winter_Shadowhooves> GilDash its meant to
<Winter_Shadowhooves> but it sorta dosent
<Winter_Shadowhooves> @Echo Off normally works
<GilDash> Winter_Shadowhooves: My amazing programming experience (*cough*) comes only from working with VBA for the last month. Prior to that, I've no knowledge at all. :D
<Phase4> 00,02random wireshark crash
<Kammerjunk> Oh, crashes. You are so random!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I have a basic expereince with Java, VBS and BAT
<Winter_Shadowhooves> nothing useful
<shana> Phase4: which port is the paintchat at?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, paintchat.bronystate.net:41411
<Winter_Shadowhooves> its funny, my college banned me from all the computers because i coded a IM
<Winter_Shadowhooves> they got scared
<GilDash> WindWhistler: You do *one* thing... :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> then I hacked the schools security system and played `Polka Is Magic` on all the computers in the college
<Flyboy> :D
<Wrek|Observiking|vac> i dont even know basic.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<Kammerjunk> Winter_Shadowhooves: I swear, people think computer knowledge = Hacking wizard.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> nope
<GilDash> WindWhistler: I knew someone who installed a "virus" onto our school system. Just did a bunch of random stuff, like mess ith your screen colours and desktop background, nothing serious. He was banned from the system. Hacked onto it after about an hour. :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> that is bs
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, ikr
<Wrek|Observiking|vac> thats my coding abillities
<Chrysalis> hey guys
<Winter_Shadowhooves> GilDash thats easy...sorta
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Wrek
<Winter_Shadowhooves> hey
<GilDash> Winter_Shadowhooves: It wasn't supposed to be hard. He only took so long to hack onto the system because he had an hour lesson. :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> XD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> the college had norton
<Winter_Shadowhooves> too easy
<Kammerjunk> ...Yeah, they kinda had it coming.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Ee-Yup
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i love norton
<Winter_Shadowhooves> NO
<Cypresswolf> :D Was that Dean from Iron Giant
<GilDash> My mate had Norton. It *broke* his machine. :D
<VioletGreySha> ohai Wrek|Observiking|vac
<CrazyCherry> Hiya everypony!!!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> GilDash :D
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: That's what you get for using Norton.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Hai
<GilDash> *Never* got it working *ever* again! :D
<Winter_Shadowhooves> they went on to install Mcafe
<CrazyCherry> GilDash???
*GilDash snuggles CrazyCherry.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<shana> Phase4: moment
<Kammerjunk> What version of Luna is this?
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i cant hack this into working without
<Kammerjunk> Dream or nightmare?
*CrazyCherry hugs GilDash tightly.
<d3rb> hey Twi_Fi
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I installed Ubuntu onto a PC at college, I could access everyones accounts files
<Winter_Shadowhooves> even the admins
<Twi_Fi> Hello d3rb
<shana> Phase4: http://pastebin.com/f2Tryyif run this script and pipe it into full_nc.data
<Winter_Shadowhooves> XD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> thats genius
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Phase4> 00,02not sure python works in sygwin
<Phase4> 00,02cygwin'
<Winter_Shadowhooves> view-source:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36589656/moving%20rectanges.html
<Flyboy> phase4:can you put on september by thelivingtombstone for me?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> do it filly
<shana> Phase4: but that's not python Oo
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i know, i meen the python script
<Kammerjunk> I hear Python is fun.
<Flyboy> thanks :)
<Flyboy> its my fav song
<shana> Phase4: don't run it in cygwin, use normal cmd.exe
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I heard a new tombstone song thats not relased yet. curtosy of Yelling At Cats
<Winter_Shadowhooves> He let me listen to it
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Gun Cake
<Phase4> 00,02no netcat on cygwin
<Phase4> 00,02time to google
<shana> darn you windows
<shana> netcat is awesome
<Phase4> 00,02i'd just use linux but screencap is broken
<Winter_Shadowhooves> netcat?
<shana> it's like cat
<shana> except it can work with sockets
<shana> so you can 'cat file | nc ip port' will open a tcp connection and pipe the file through the tcp channel
<Kammerjunk> I can't explain why, but I listen to certain genres when doing certain things.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Who is exited for Gun Cake?
<Kammerjunk> For example, if I'm messing with hardware, it's metal.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i like the bash variables
<Phase4> 00,02cant realy do that from cmd.exe
<shana> hmm
<Phase4> 00,02well, i could but then i'd have to add more to my path
<Winter_Shadowhooves> cmd is useful for certain things
<Phase4> 00,02and its already 8 feet long
<shana> Phase4: base64 also isn't on standard windows..
<MisterFoster> thats what she said
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 i just reboot
<shana> Phase4: I mean I could write a python version of it ^_^
<Flyboy> i just remembered what happened in september, IM THE ONE WHO KILLED THEM ALL! :[
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what windows is it?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what version
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma just reboot
<Phase4> 00,02try from linux
<Winter_Shadowhooves> you have Ubuntu?
<Kammerjunk> I hate rebooting. Too many Firefox tabs to open.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> time to chat on skype
<Flyboy> so guys
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yes?
<Kammerjunk> So Flyboy.
<Flyboy> whats your fav mlp song
<Winter_Shadowhooves> smile smile smile
<Kammerjunk> Official? Probably Smile Smile Smile.
<EspyLacopa> Everyone: Make sure your computer is not infected by the DNSChanger malware. FBI is shutting down the botnet servers (Finally!) tomorrow.
<Flyboy> from the series or fanmade
<Flyboy> either
<Kammerjunk> Fanmade? I haven't a goddamn clue.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> who wants to speak with me on skype? im bored.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> winter.shadowhooves
<Winter_Shadowhooves> skype name^]
<Kammerjunk> Depends on what I'm doing, really.
<Stormman3100> if more than one person does, sure
<Stormman3100> Im shy lol
<Flyboy> for me Fanmade=September Official=Winter Warp Up
<Kammerjunk> Meh. I broke my mic.
<Kammerjunk> I think.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> fanmade sunshine and celery stalks
<Winter_Shadowhooves> official smile x3
<Phase4> 00,02so...
<Phase4> 00,02how to go about screencasting
<Winter_Shadowhooves> err
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what linux version do you have?
<Kammerjunk> So I'm looking at the site of a netcafé I like. They actually used "girls are no strangers here" as an advertisements.
<Phase4> 00,02archlinux
<Winter_Shadowhooves> whats that like?
<Phase4> 00,02diy linux
<shana> Phase4: err I looked at that, and there are some ways but none of them are very convenient :(
<Winter_Shadowhooves> cool
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I just use Ubuntu
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I tried puppy linux
<Winter_Shadowhooves> but it looked crap
<Cypresswolf> Im going back to sleep - sleeping in a chair does not give you the best nights sleep :P
<Winter_Shadowhooves> like a bad photoshop UI
<shana> Phase4: http://www.ws4gl.org/ is awesome in concept
<Phase4> 00,02puppy linux is not that usefull as a desktop distro
<shana> Phase4: ant it works somehow
<Kammerjunk> What I really don't get is when people get Ubuntu and then get as many Windows themes as they possibly can.
<shana> s/ant/and
<Winter_Shadowhooves> oops
<Phase4> 00,02shana, could work, i use compiz and thats 90% of the performance problem when streaming
<Phase4> 00,02i'm streaming with x11grab right now
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if its even working
<Flyboy> Phase4: what we doing now?
<EspyLacopa> There be stream?
<Flyboy> and by the looks of it, it isnt
<Phase4> 00,02there be attempted stream
<Phase4> 00,022fps
<Phase4> 00,02theres a bug in here somewhere
<Kammerjunk> Oh lol.
<Flyboy> heyhey!
<Flyboy> there we go
<Flyboy> erm...
<Phase4> 00,02dats better
<Flyboy> there we go
<Flyboy> we can see it
<Flyboy> nvm
<Kammerjunk> Erryday I'm bufferin'.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, its lagging here for some rason
<Phase4> 00,02reason'
<Phase4> 00,02and then ffmpeg seized
<Kammerjunk> Bah, it's only 2 PM and I have no idea what to do.
<Phase4> 00,02that seems to be working
<Ghosties> 04Have a good one folks, see you all later~
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Ghosties.
<Phase4> 00,02later Ghosties
<Phase4> 00,02Excelent
<Flyboy> bye ghosties
<Phase4> 00,02its lagging real bad here but otherwise perfect
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: did you take the razons
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Ghosties. Take care.
<Phase4> 00,02or not
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02its lagging about twice as hard on stream
<shana> Phase4: I commited the code to bitbucket, including an example dump
<shana> Phase4: also the script now has cl parameters for input/output file
*Ghosties waves
<shana> that's some crazy 3d effects
<Winter_Shadowhooves> how much ram?
<shana> 16GB iirc
<Phase4> 00,02wow, i'm starting to get tired
<Phase4> 00,0216GB
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i love me some compiz :3
<Phase4> 00,02its easier on the eyes than not havint them
<Phase4> 00,02having'
<Phase4> 00,02no *clang clang* movment, everything is fluid
<shana> hmm..
<shana> I like to switch workspaces instantly ^_^
<shana> Oo did I commit output.svg
<shana> didn't want that, it's huge
<Phase4> 00,02lol double sound
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you did, meh
<shana> darn :/
<shana> now that's gonna be there FOREVER
<Phase4> 00,02urgh
<Phase4> 00,02what was i doing
<Phase4> 00,02shana, can you paste the thing again?
<shana> Phase4: I commited it
<shana> git pull
<EspyLacopa> I hear a stream. . .
<shana> do you? I hear nothing :(
<EspyLacopa> Python calro?
<shana> cairo
<shana> Phase4: only accepts filenames, sorry :D
<Phase4> 00,02i has all my music :3
<Phase4> 00,02shana, no problem, /dev/stdin
<Phase4> 00,02for the few programs that dont alias -
<shana> wow that's a bash feature I didn't know
<shana> I know bash has crazy stuff like /dev/tcp and so
<shana> Phase4: oh btw the script never stops
<shana> it just keeps reading from tcp
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02chrome dislikes this svg
<EspyLacopa> ...Do I hear Bastion perhap?
<shana> Phase4: the script needs to finish
<Phase4> 00,02EspyLacopa, that you do
<EspyLacopa> That was such a fun game.
<Hrafn> I got the game, but haven't played it yet o:
<shana> and ctrl-c isn't handled gracefully in the script, sorry ^_^
<EspyLacopa> Hrafn: You totally should.
<shana> you need to first dump it into a file
<Hrafn> I will, I've just been distracted by other games so far
<Saturn> 08,01boing
<EspyLacopa> The final bit of the game is fantastic.
<EspyLacopa> No man gets left behind.
<shana> a wild Saturn bounces into the chat!
<Phase4> 00,02that all looks correct
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<alexxm> EspyLacopa what game are you talking about
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Saturn
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, turn on stream now and you can see my linux install
*Saturn 08,01bounces around the channel, stuffing cupcakes in everones mouth
<EspyLacopa> alexxm: Bastion
<Saturn> 08,01im on my phone
*Hrafn squeaks and noms a cupcake
<shana> Phase4: yeah but it's a pita (pain in the ass) to get all the brushes etc. working...
<Phase4> 00,02shana, "WHAT TO DOOOOOO???" o_O
<alexxm> EspyLacopa never heard of it whats it about
<shana> Phase4: I didn't know that anyone else was ever going to look at that source ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02fair enough
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: implant the /me command while your at it
<alexxm> hey Saturn how have you been
<shana> Phase4: there are a lots of variables in the decompiled source that I don't know what they mean
<EspyLacopa> it's about a Kid after a cataclysm broke the world, and he's trying to build a bastion amidst the wreckage.
<Phase4> 00,02s/a lot/all the variables/
<shana> there's obvious stuff like iColor and iSize
<EspyLacopa> Part of its awesome is the narrator, Rucks.
<shana> I think the iHint is the tool type?
<alexxm> sounds intreasting EspyLacopa
<EspyLacopa> it's an action game, with essentially a top-down view.
<Flyboy> Phase4: what are you actually trying to do?
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, make some code ran
<Phase4> 00,02run'
<shana> also, what to doo is actually from mlp ^_^
<Hrafn> I like how indie games have been getting really good
<alexxm> EspyLacopa whats the going price for it?
<Phase4> 00,02did that, so learning time
<Phase4> 00,02^ Hrafn
<shana> I think I wrote the script at the time the best pet episode was running..
<Flyboy> ah i see, coding and stuff. i know nothing about it XD
<Phase4> 00,02indie everything is getting better
*EspyLacopa checks
<shana> altough.. how old is paintchat ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02excuse me while my brain reboots
<Phase4> 00,02shana, java 1.1
<Phase4> 00,02i think its late 90's
<Phase4> 00,02last update was 2003
<shana> Phase4: hmm how do you know?
<Phase4> 00,02extencive googling
<Princess_Cadence> Hi
<shana> oh ok
<Hrafn> indie games and movies seem to dare taking larger risks when it comes to trying new things
<DatOneBrony> what are you doing?
<Phase4> 00,02and the timestamps on pchat366.jar
<alexxm> hey Princess_Cadence hows your day been
<Princess_Cadence> HI everyone
<Princess_Cadence> Great glad you asked
<Phase4> 00,02DatOneBrony, waiting for my brain to reboot
<EspyLacopa> 15 dollars on steam, 1200 xbox point things on XBox Live.
<RainBowJack> hello Princess_Cadence
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma get some water while that happens
<alexxm> thanks EspyLacopa
<MegaMoonShine> Hi dudes! :)
<Princess_Cadence> Hai

<Princess_Cadence> gildash and crazycherry are online..
<oni_link> Have a good day at work Saturn!!!
<alexxm> hey Hrafn hows yoru day been
<Princess_Cadence> Bye Saturn!
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: just as a exerment what happens if you set the video bitrate to the lowest setting it allows
<Princess_Cadence> brb
<Hrafn> so far so good
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> experment
<shana> Phase4: kinda crazy that the java api remained this stable oO
<oni_link> Am I the only one who doesn't like what Facebook is becoming?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> my facebook is just porn....why do people like pics i dont like and it spams my wall
<alexxm> oni_link hows it getting bad
<oni_link> alexxm: my news feed is just BOMBARDED with all this sappy hipster lovey dovey mumbo jumbo
<oni_link> [wklmjhe]JRP2234: if its not the other things i said its that as well :D
<MisterFoster> lol like what mumbo jumbo?
<alexxm> ah right oni_link i don't really get that hipster stuff on my news feed
<MegaMoonShine> What's the name of this song?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, the api is incredibly stable
<MegaMoonShine> Has a nice beat, I like it :)
<Phase4> 00,02they never change, only add
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, on ffmpeg thats probably 1kb/s
<Phase4> 00,02not interested in running it that slow
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> can i see the delay time
<Hrafn> my facebook mostly contains random funny links from my brothers and George Takeiness :P
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02ws4gl apears to be gstreamer based
<oni_link> MisterFoster: Oh like for example they take pics off of Tumblr and my friends like em. Everyone is becoming a like and share whore. and also, its always pics that have to do wirh relationships, love , or "teen things" im in my 20s and already annoyed with it all
<Phase4> 00,02shana, as such the java api is massive
<Phase4> 00,02and only going to get bigger
*oni_link attacks Phase4 with a hug
*Phase4 00,02hugs oni_link back
<shana> Phase4: hmm all I know it's mainly written in java, not sure what media backend it uses
<oni_link> I like the music you have on today Phase :4
<oni_link> :$
<Phase4> 00,02shana, its own
<Hrafn> I've only really added my family and a handful of friends on facebook, so I don't have that problem, not yet at least
<oni_link> yesh
<Saturn> 08,01baaaaahahahaha
<Hrafn> but I do have to put up with baby pictures
<Saturn> 08,01I AM THE MASRTER OF THE CLOUD
<shana> Phase4: what does it use for transcoding and stuff?
<oni_link> Hrafn: youll be there soon. and its not pretty
<Phase4> 00,02derp brain
<Phase4> 00,02shana, ?
<Hrafn> it's okay, I have goggles
<Princess_Cadence> bak made an ice cream
<Hrafn> the goggles will protect me
<Phase4> 00,02distractions
<oni_link> Saturn: Nimbus afficionado
*Saturn 08,01now has a 20 server rack running as a cloud
<Phase4> 00,02why do i have them
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: i prefer cirrus
<Phase4> 00,02shana, theres a png library somewhere in the java libs, it uses that once or twice iirc
<oni_link> Saturn: that works :P
<Phase4> 00,02everything else though is handled in its codebase
<FairysHuff> Hallo every pony!
<oni_link> and nice job with that server
<Hrafn> hi there :3
<oni_link> Hi FairysHuff
<Princess_Cadence> hai
<Saturn> 08,01now to get my tools running on the blades...
<Princess_Cadence> Hai Hrafn
<shana> Phase4: I mean video && audo transcoding
<FairysHuff> How is everypony doing?
<Saturn> 08,01hey Hrafn
<Princess_Cadence> Great
<Saturn> 08,01Hrafn: are you swedish?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not sure what you meen then
<shana> Phase4: I think it uses ffmpeg
<Hrafn> so far so good
<Hrafn> and yeah, I'm Swedish
<Saturn> 08,01Hrafn: did you study in edinburgh?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, java or ws4gl?
<shana> Phase4: ws4gl
<oni_link> I like the UI, what OS is this?
<Hrafn> Saturn: nah, I didn't
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Phase4> 00,02oh god, it wants netbeans
<Miriu> Hai!
<shana> I guess that is gnome?
<Phase4> 00,02this might take a while
<alexxm> hey Miriu hows yoru day bee
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm not sure yet
<Saturn> 08,01you just have the same nick as someone i know who did a phd at edinburgh
<Phase4> 00,02theres a copy of ffmpeg for windows in its svn
<oni_link> Ah, nevermind. I just saw from the tab :D
<Miriu> alexxm Good thanks for asking :)
<Saturn> 08,01who is also swedish
<Hrafn> ah, cool :3
<shana> never used netbeans
<Miriu> im not sedish but im estonian
<Miriu> swedish
<shana> I hate projects without makefile ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01and had the most EPIC of beards
<shana> (or ant build file or whatever buildsystem)
*FairysHuff dances through the chat twirling pink battons.
<Hrafn> I had the most epic of beards too :O
<Saturn> 08,01swedes are mostly sexy
<Jim> ^
<Saturn> 08,01especially when they are Wrek
<Hrafn> I've trimmed it down to a goatee, though
<Hrafn> but I used to have a ZZ Top style beard
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<Phase4> 00,02200MB download for netbeans
<oni_link> Hrafn: I am jelly of what you had :P
<Saturn> 08,01Hrafn: your name isnt oscar, is it?
<Hrafn> nah, my real name is Peter :P
<Phase4> 00,02i now have yet another ide installed in less space than visual studio
<shana> Phase4: shouldn't it work in eclipse?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, not sure
<Saturn> 08,01i do not know how visual studio takes up so much damn space...
<oni_link> I wish I was more tech savvy, I would love a brony state APK.
<Phase4> 00,02aparently you can use ant
<shana> oni_link: android package?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, neither do i
<Saturn> 08,01not that ive used it in 10 years
<oni_link> shana: yes :)
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: im thinking of making one
<shana> oni_link: hmm that's actually quite feasible..
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, i used vs6 once
<Saturn> 08,01i do android dev
<Phase4> 00,02its only gotten bigger sence
<shana> oni_link: if you have vlc for android and such you can watch the stream
<FairysHuff> I was wondering if any pony would like to start up a MicroVolts team? Casual playing. I've no interest in tournaments ^_^
<oni_link> Saturn: I am willing to test if you need anypony to do it?
<Saturn> 08,01aye, i think 6 was the last one i used
<Phase4> 00,02seems it needs netbeans installed either way
<Phase4> 00,02org.netbeans.lib.awtextra
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: sure, if i do it ill get you testing
<shana> uuh yeah
<oni_link> shana: I can see it on my SIII but an app would be so much nicer
<Saturn> 08,01what phone yohu got?
<shana> SIII === samsung galaxy 3?
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<oni_link> Saturn: Galaxy SIII (US) on ICS
*Saturn 08,01has a Desire £
<oni_link> shana: that is correct :)
<shana> well I don't have much free time now ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01*Desire Z
<alexxm> how come shana
<oni_link> Saturn: I also have a Droid 2 but oh lord... Never again
<shana> alexxm: bachelor stuff and exam stuff coming up
<Hrafn> I got an SII just a few months before the SIII came out :P
<FairysHuff> shana How is the battery life on that phone? I'm curious.
<alexxm> hope that goes well shana
<shana> FairysHuff: I don't have one, ask oni_link :D
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: really? i was thinkijng my next upgrade would be a droid
<shana> alexxm: thanks ^_^
<FairysHuff> oni_link How is the battery life on that phone? ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01because htc have stopped maiking keyboard phones
<FairysHuff> shana heh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> this just gets more complicated everyday
<FairysHuff> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG What does?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Paintchat
<FairysHuff> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG Ah. Can't say I've used it
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Phase4> 00,02netbeans sucks
<shana> actually this right now is not about paintchat :D
<oni_link> Saturn: They are alright, but I had a bad experience. Bad battery life and I was unfortunate enough to have poorly built devices. I had to replace my phone 6 times this year alone. And this was with their new device, The Bionic mind you.
<Phase4> 00,02which makes sense
<Phase4> 00,02this is the offical java ide
*FairysHuff has as much artistic skill as a blind pony with no legs.
<shana> Phase4: I REALLY hope you can change the look and feel..
<oni_link> Saturn: also I understand where you are coming from, I love keyboard devices but I'd rather have something that runs without problems
<Phase4> 00,02not a clue of that worked
<shana> FairysHuff: paint with your mouth!
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, a keyboardless smartphone is pretty much useless to.me
<Saturn> 08,01becuase its impossible for me to ssh on a software keyboard
<oni_link> FairysHuff: Its pretty darn good. It lasts a day and a half on average. And I am an Android power user :P
<FairysHuff> shana I do that frquently but it's usually against my will. ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02still not sure if this worked
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: kinky
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma stop stream and try this
<shana> FairysHuff: you need to stop saying to yourself that you have no skills..
<FairysHuff> oni_link I don't even know why I'm asking. I don't even use my current phone ^_^
<FairysHuff> shana That one is true though.
<oni_link> Saturn: well, the Droid 4 is good from what I hear but... from personal experience, I had a bad time with Motorola.
<shana> FairysHuff: saying that you have no skills hinders you significantly from acquiring them
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Thanks for streaming
<Twilight_S> Good morning everypony
<oni_link> FairysHuff: It doesnt hurt to know. Its a really smooth, fast and long lasting device :)
<FairysHuff> shana Oh trust me my lack of artistic skill is not through any lack of trying.
<oni_link> hello Twilight_S
<Hrafn> good morning Twilight_S

<alexxm> hey Twilight_S you sleep well
<FairysHuff> oni_link I'm thinking of getting rid of my phone and replacing it with a MiFi device for my android pad.
<Phase4> 00,02so, ws4gl is useless
<shana> Phase4: why?
<alexxm> chat derped refreashing
<shana> Phase4: oh because you do the same thing?
<oni_link> FairysHuff: what pad are you on?
<Phase4> 00,02and then it crashed my window decorator
<alexxm> back
<Phase4> 00,02shana, because i can get avconv and do that directly
<shana> :/
<oni_link> hiya alexxm
<alexxm> hey oni_link
<FairysHuff> oni_link The ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 with keyboard dock. So lots of power and battery life.
<shana> Phase4: true, but you can do fancy stuff with ws4gl like compositing different stuff..
<Twilight_S> Yes I did, thanks for asking alexxm
<FairysHuff> oni_link I'm extremely forgetful so it helps a lot.
<shana> Phase4: but yeah the actual streaming stuff isn't any better :(
<alexxm> good to hear Twilight_S
<oni_link> FairysHuff: Those things look so fun. Im not in the market for a tab but the phone/tab fusion really screams at my techie side lol :P
<FairysHuff> oni_link heh ^_^ I hate speaking on the phone so replacing it entirely with a MiFi device so I can just use email instead would be great.
<Flyboy> what happened?
<FairyHuff|AFK> Back in a bit. Pizza is ready.
<oni_link> FairysHuff: that doesnt sound like a bad idea actually. but then youre limited to the MiFi network right?
<Phase4> 00,02stream working?
<Saturn> 08,01oh nice
<oni_link> YUP :P
<Saturn> 08,01smoking power supply

<Nerom> Did the stream die again?
<Saturn> 08,01okay, not evacuating the bukding
<oni_link> uh oh, I'm buffering again
<Saturn> 08,01because i just disabled the smoke detector
<Saturn> 08,01temporarily

<oni_link> Saturn: please be careful :(
<Saturn> 08,01its okay though
<Saturn> 08,01i left a sticky note for myself
<Twilight_S> So what are you up to everypony?

<Flyboy> Phase4: was the artist David Larson
<alexxm> ok Lil_B sorry i don't really know anything about coding
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, nope
<Flyboy> hmm...
<Lil_B> alexxm np, it has nothing to do qwith coding anyway, just abou how this programm works in general that confuses me XD
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, my brains gone for tonight

<Unnr> Ohai!~
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I don't know. You were hovering your mouse over the topic bar as if you were thinking of it. Sorry.
<Phase4> 00,02streams going off so you guys cant peak at the name
<Phase4> 00,02OnDaCountOfKandarihu, i loose track of my mouse, most of my time is spent on the keyboard
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I see.
<Flyboy> Phase4: if i ever get it right, i want my muffins to go to all the homeless or starving fillies
<ACS13123> woah wut>?
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly ACS13123

<ACS13123> Phase4: I was here the whole time, stoopid Phase4 stooopid :p
<Lil_B> ohai ACS13123
<FlaxMan> epic TETRIS!!!!

<Phase4> 00,02shana, maybe
<shana> dat maybe
<Sumica> 00,10so whats all this?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Coding
<Phase4> 00,02very slow coding
<Sumica> 00,10Sounds fasanating
<Phase4> 00,02wow, this code
<Phase4> 00,02not nice
<Bronysith> Sumica: popcorn?
<Phase4> 00,02at least it has the decency to re-use threads
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Coding is so complex =/
<Unnr> Mmm, christmas music remixes
<ACS13123> So anyway, What you doing Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, reading code
<alexxm> hey ACS13123 hows your day been
<ACS13123> Phase4: sounds fun :p
<Phase4> 00,02still waiting on the artist :P
<ACS13123> alexxm: its been good
<Flyboy> Dat Code
<Phase4> 00,02someone here must know
<alexxm> i know nothing about coding
<Phase4> 00,02frames are dropping again
<Phase4> 00,02might die
<Phase4> 00,02stupid x11grab
<Phase4> 00,02think it just went
<Phase4> 00,02chat is so silent
<Lil_B> I can only tell you the song, not the artist XD
<Unnr> Ok, I am seriously enjoying the Manneheim Steamroller vibe this artist has
*Ninjazz hugs Phase4 loudly
*Phase4 00,02hugs Ninjazz back
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Flyboy> Ninjazz: How can you hug loadly?
<Lil_B> Unnr whaats Mannheim Steamroller?
<Flyboy> loudly*
<Phase4> 00,02because none of you seem to know (which makes me disapoint :<) its VioletVanilla
<Unnr> Was the one song labled Bring a Torch or Un Flambeaux, Phase4?
<Lil_B> hi Ninjazz :)
<shana> so it was vi :D
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Lil_B. :)
*Ninjazz sends a regular hug to Lil_B
<Unnr> Lil_B: A group that specializes in sytnthesiser remixed christmas music
*Lil_B hugs Ninjazz in a polite manner
<Phase4> 00,02allso: AO: [pulse] 96000Hz 2ch s32le (4 bytes per sample)
<Phase4> 00,02high quality flac's
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Ninjazz> How polite~ :3
<Saturn> 08,01took out the fried power supply
<Lil_B> Unnr oh ok :)
<Phase4> 00,02cant hear it there of course but still
<Saturn> 08,01then spent the last 20 minutes looking at cat pictures on reddit
<Saturn> 08,01i have best work ethic
<Phase4> 00,02sounds great here before the aac encoder mangles it
<Lil_B> FLAC is awesome :)
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: indeed
<Unnr> Saturn: Mmmm dead power supplies
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: this one was smoking
<Saturn> 08,01so i had to disable the fire alarm
<Saturn> 08,01to stop the entire building being evacuated
<Phase4> 00,02http://mina.apache.org/ i dont see a documentation link
<Unnr> Saturn: Did it jave a giant dust-rabbit in it?
<Phase4> 00,02ignore that
<Phase4> 00,02i'm tired
<Lil_B> Phase4 but how would we have been to tell, if we don't know where we can get her music XD
<Saturn> 08,01oh, that reminds me, i should reenable it
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: no, 3 caps were blown
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: no idea why
<Saturn> 08,01but the transformer's secondary was shorted too
<Saturn> 08,01so... yeah
<Phase4> 00,02mfw cant find on google
<Saturn> 08,01at least now i know why the whole rack tripped
<Phase4> 00,02dis is an outragfe
<Phase4> 00,02dis is a horrible outrage
<Unnr> Saturn: Oh horseapples one of those. Cap Plague?
<Phase4> 00,02http://vibedeck.com/valentinewinter
<Phase4> 00,02There we go
<Phase4> 00,02googled the url, hopefully that triggers it to index it or something
<Malavolent> Aww, dat music :3
<Malavolent> Anyway, is anyone alive here?
<Phase4> 00,02i am
<Phase4> 00,02mostly
<alexxm> i'm still here
<Malavolent> So it's just two of us :3
<Phase4> 00,02infact bed is probably a very good idea
<FlaxMan> still here
<Malavolent> You seem to stream quite often lately, Phase.
<Phase4> 00,02well wrek would normaly be streaming around now
<Unnr> Malavolent: Phase is in a good timezone to stream when most of the rest of the mods are sleeping
<Phase4> 00,02but he's on vacatoion
<Phase4> 00,02vacation;
<Phase4> 00,02and Sumica has been ending early
<Malavolent> Is that so?
<Malavolent> Where are you from Phase, if I may ask?
<Unnr> Yay!
<Unnr> I mean... nopony said sumica´s name
<Malavolent> Unnr: It's okay, we get it.
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, Australia
<Malavolent> Reminds me to set "yay" as my message tone on phone.
<Phase4> 00,02i like dis album too
*Contex hits Phase4 with a stick
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Contex> :>
<Malavolent> Phase4: Nonsense, the stream isn't upside down!
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Lil_B> ohai Malavolent :)
<Unnr> Malavolent: >_> Don´t mind me, was up wayyyyy to early and worke up earlier than expected.
<Malavolent> Heya, Lil_B :)
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, or covered in spiders and sheep
<Malavolent> Phase4: Mostly in spiders.
<Lil_B> I'm semi in the chat XDm there is so much for me to do right now XD
<Unnr> Tarzan was such a strange adaptation
<Flyboy> isnt this the tarzan theme 6_9
<Malavolent> Anyone here plays LoL?
<Phase4> 00,02firefox is epic lagged
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, yup
<Flyboy> knew it!
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, i've never read the books, Love the movie though
<Phase4> 00,02especily the soundtrack
<Phase4> 00,02which contains the manliest song ever made imho
<Phase4> 00,02behind winter wrap up that is :P
<Flyboy> :D
<Phase4> 00,02y u consume my cpu firefox
<Contex> silly FF
<Malavolent> Winter wrap up was the first song I learned to play on guitar.
<Phase4> 00,02then it solves itself
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<Contex> Magic ^
<Malavolent> First one where you don't have to play chords, that is.
<Unnr> Phase4, the books are pretty interesting, actually. That being said the movie was alot of fun, and it made a great kingdom hearts level
<Unnr> except for the vines... those accursed vines
<Phase4> 00,02it made a kingdom hearts level?
<Phase4> 00,02i do remember a pc game that was quite fun
<Flyboy> a greay philosipher once said,"we take what is usual as normal. so if grown people now usually watch MLP FiM, does that make it normal?
<Phase4> 00,02havent played in many years though
<Flyboy> "Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02DIS SONG
<Malavolent> Flyboy: Well, if most of the adult people watched FiM, it would be considered normal.
<Phase4> 00,02SON OF MAN :3
<Unnr> Phase4 it not only made a KH level, it was a level in the first game.... DUN DUN Dunnnnnnnn
<Flyboy> eeyup
<ACS13123> gaben@valvesoftware.com...
<ACS13123> "You can reach me at GABEN@valvesoftware.com"
<Bronysith> YES http://www.deviantart.com/#/d56jehh ALL OF MY WANT
<Malavolent> Bronysith: But does it have a hole?
<Bronysith> Malavolent: gross man
<Malavolent> Couldn't resist.
<ACS13123> Malavolent: Thats not being made again
<Malavolent> The community took the Lyra plushie thing way too far, it's actually quite funny.
<Bronysith> Malavolent: i know
<Bronysith> really funny lololo
<Phase4> 00,02i love that song
<Malavolent> I'm glad you agree.
<Phase4> 00,02the next one is fun to
<Bronysith> Malavolent: MFW i saw the lyra plushie http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Unnr> It its defense, the community got hours of entertainment from it
<Unnr> ... in a noneww manner
<Malavolent> Bronysith: That might be photoshoped, just alittle.
<Bronysith> Malavolent: you dont say?
<Malavolent> Damnit, can't get the fluttershy yay sound anywhere.
<Malavolent> Bronysith: Well I do say.
<Sumica> 00,10I say all the reaction images are geting a tad old Bronysith
<Malavolent> True dat.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Bronysith: whats a Bront?
<Bronysith> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: what?
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6twd8NxE11r3xauuo1_1280.png
<Phase4> 00,02the magic start function
<Phase4> 00,02called form nowhere but i know its called
<MegaMoonShine> Hi again! :)
<Bronysith> hi MegaMoonShine again
<MegaMoonShine> I have been having problems with my crappy internet
<Flyboy> Phase4: can you look for a band named Two Steps From Hell, and play some of their music
<MegaMoonShine> Omgomg it's this song :$
<Flyboy> its soundtracks
<Flyboy> my fav kind of music
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, i like some of their music but for reasons i cant realy use flash right now
<Flyboy> kk
<Malavolent> Whoever can get me this exact sound in mp3 form will be my hero. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXSHNzyqh3M
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Two Steps from Hell is awesome
<MegaMoonShine> Malavolent: just use youtube converter
<Malavolent> Tried that already
<Malavolent> It converts, but the sound is cut somewhere in the middle
<MegaMoonShine> Hmmmm...
<Malavolent> Converters have problems with very short videos.
<Phase4> 00,02...
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, it is so trivial to do that i dont even need a browser
<oni_link> Malavolent: What about YouTube Downloader? You would have to download the clip and then with the same program, convert it to an MP3. I use it all the time :)
<Saturn> 08,01IS ANYONE WATCHIGN THE WIMBLEDON?
<Saturn> 08,01my god IT IS TENSE
<shana> ouch my ears :(
<Saturn> 08,01it's going to be a great game
<Saturn> 08,01who is streaming?
<oni_link> Still Phase4 Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i really want to put this up, if the stream's free
<Malavolent> oni_link: That's the hard way, I guess.
<Phase4> 00,02already done Malavolent
<Saturn> 08,01it's Federrer vs. Murray
<oni_link> Malavolent: Yeah, but its worth it
<Saturn> 08,01Murray serving, 3 sets to 4, in deuce
<Flyboy> Hell yeah! more tron
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/out.m4a
<MegaMoonShine> Daft Punk is best punk
<Saturn> 08,01no, i tell a lie, advantage murray
<Flyboy> tron was an amazing movie. hope there is more like it
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, if you realy need mp3 i can do that too
<Saturn> 08,01does anyone care about the tennis?
<Flyboy> XD
<Saturn> 08,01actually
<Malavolent> Phase4: Thanks, I can conver that.
<Saturn> 08,01i suppose if you did, you'd be watchign it
<Saturn> 08,01bbc is almost certainly covering it on world service
<Saturn> 08,01or bbc america
<Saturn> 08,01i dunno
<Saturn> 08,01maybe it's not popular enough
<oni_link> Dat dropbox link :P
<Saturn> 08,01WOOO! 4 GAMES ALL!
<Phase4> 00,02lol Saturn
<Phase4> 00,02theres a guy here watching the same game
<Saturn> 08,01i'm caught in a dilemma here
<MegaMoonShine> There is a bbc america? :S
<Phase4> 00,02its on channel 7 here
<Unnr> Saturn: Tennis is also covered on the large sport channel in the US, ESPN, IIRC
<Saturn> 08,01Murray is Scottish
<Saturn> 08,01but Federrer is so much HOTTER
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm happy either way
<Saturn> 08,01though really, my scottish pride overrules my lustfulness
*oni_link is working on some Sonic 4 8bit remixes
<brony_swan> sup bros
<Saturn> 08,01federrer serving, 15 - 30
<Saturn> 08,01he might just break service
<MegaMoonShine> sup brony_swan :)
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh! break point!
<GilDash> Saturn: Wait, Murray's actually holding out? :O
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: oh yes
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not an expert
<GilDash> Saturn: Wow... who'd have thought?
<Phase4> 00,02but murray seems to be winning
<Saturn> 08,01which is surprising; though murray's late game is generally quite good
<Phase4> 00,02not by much though
<Unnr> Saturn, though so far the best game had to be Serena in the Semifinals, because those serves were awesome
<Saturn> 08,01though federrer's early game is always superb
<Saturn> 08,01HE BROKE SERVE!
<Saturn> 08,01\O/
*Bronysith sits on Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01murray serving 5 sets to 4
<Saturn> 08,01*games
<Saturn> 08,01sorry
<Saturn> 08,01murray serving 5 games to 4
<Malavolent> Hey Phase4 if you still got free time, try converting the m4a file into mp3. I've run into the same problem as I did before.
<Unnr> *claps*
<Saturn> 08,01this is so cool
<Saturn> 08,01oh man, excellent shot
<Saturn> 08,01you guys should watch this
<Saturn> 08,01while murray doesn't have federrer's raw finesse, it's psychologically murray's game
*Unnr lacks television service ATM, have a live stream link Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01because my god, it must be so offputting to have the crowd cheer so much when you fuck up
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/yay.mp3
<Malavolent> 404 :/
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: if you can get iPlayer, i'll pm you the link
<Unnr> I can get the iPlayer trivially
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, try now
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i could watch this in HD
<Saturn> 08,01i might go down the pub
<Saturn> 08,01they'll have it in HD
<Malavolent> Phase4: Great, it works, thanks :)
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, that moment when i'm on the other side of the world and i can get it in hd
<Saturn> 08,01see... the tragedy of it all is that i actually own a 42" HD TV
<Saturn> 08,01but i gave it to my parents
<Saturn> 08,01because i don't watch TV
<Saturn> 08,01and my dad hates tennis
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<Saturn> 08,01their TV broke so i decided to buy them a £300 tv...
<GilDash> Saturn: No, that's just "Sod's Law." :D

<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Yes! Yes I've been the victim of those idiots.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ikr
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: all i can recommend is sit at a piano, and use your ear, after learning some music theory
<Lil_B> Saturn oh :/ I that case I must figure it out myself and maybe get inspiration from existing pieces
<Saturn> 08,01counterpoint and harmony
<Saturn> 08,01yes, critical listening is your greatest weapon!
<Unnr> Lil_B: http://www.musictheory.net/lessons is a not too long to basic chord theory
<Lil_B> Unnr I played Keyboard for 7 years... the theory contained transposing, and simple cord progressions
<Saturn> 08,01aye

<Unnr> Hmm, the 68 version of Romeo and Juliet wasn´t bad, but looks a bit dated
<Saturn> 08,01CK|Catnap: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!

<Unnr> Ouch, that looked like that hurt
<RAWRity> heh, this guy seems happy: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6uigfegrr1r55dpso1_500.jpg
<Toranaga> XD
<otakon> eeyup
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<otakon> hiya RAWRity
<otakon> brb need some eats
<Saturn> 08,01okay looks like
<Saturn> 08,01im not going to stream
<Toranaga> How do you even become a mod?
<Saturn> 08,01you can apply when we open up mod applications
<Toranaga> Mkay
<RAWRity> Toranaga: when they open up applications, you apply, and go through an interview process.
<killerpony7733> Hasn't that been ages since though Saturn?
<Toranaga> Because if no one is streaming then I think it's time for new mods.
<Barbetos> Agh... I have to go to the store but I don't want toooooooooo
<RAWRity> Toranaga: that is the dumbest thing I've heard all afternoon.
<RAWRity> granted that afternoon is only 7 minutes old, but still, you r teh dumbz
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: only a few months
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Ah i see
<Toranaga> I'm dumb now?
<RAWRity> It's been about 5 months since the newest mods were brough in IIRC
<Toranaga> If that's the dumbest thing you ever heard then prepare to be baffled
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Saturn> 08,01about that
<RAWRity> Toranaga: I said all afternoon.
<RAWRity> it's currently 12:08 where I am.
<Toranaga> But what's dumb about it?
<RAWRity> >implying mods are here simply to stream for your entertainment
<killerpony7733> ^This
<Yahooz> double this
<OneTrickPony> o hai Yahooz
<Yahooz> OneTrickPony!! long time no see
<Toranaga> I was never implying that.
<OneTrickPony> Yahooz: yup
<BronyInstrumental> hello everyone!
<Barbetos> Toranaga thats the funny thing about implications, some times you don't mean to do it.
<RAWRity> Toranaga: " Because if no one is streaming then I think it's time for new mods."
<OneTrickPony> hai BronyInstrumental
<Yahooz> pfffffffft
<Toranaga> Then why blame me for the implication if you know that it's not meant?
<Saturn> 08,01ponies, chill
<OneTrickPony> why are we arguing about implying?
<Jim> >ponies pls
<OneTrickPony> XD^
<Yahooz> Toranaga: because you clearly meant what you said
<Toranaga> I did not mean to say that mods are only here for our entertainment.
<Toranaga> -_-
<Yahooz> alrighty then
<Yahooz> then deal with what is being stream mkay?
<Saturn> 08,01Toranaga: well, technically we are
<Twilight_S> How is everypony?
<Unnr> This is the match that never ends
<Saturn> 08,01but we also have our own lives
<Toranaga> Aha!
<Unnr> yes it goes one and on my friends
<Unnr> Federer and murray started playing it, not knowing what it was, but advantage keeps on chainging forever just because!
<OneTrickPony> hi Twilight_S
<Unnr> *cough*
<Saturn> 08,01and we need to sleep
<Toranaga> Of course you do, and I know that. That's why I said there should be more mods
<Toranaga> In different timezones
<Saturn> 08,01i think federer is a changeling
<Unnr> ^
<DJpon3> the vid wont play...:/
<OneTrickPony> personally, I think we have enough mods, we don't want to be like everfreeradio
<Unnr> Though that was a nice return on the cross volley
<Saturn> 08,01Toranaga: we already have like 20 mods
<OneTrickPony> Saturn: exactly
<Flyboy> anyone gonna stream soon?
<OneTrickPony> nope
<Unnr> Flyboy: Its a sunday so ???
<Flyboy> so...?
<RAWRity> seeing as there are mods in all 4 US time zones, as well as several in the UK and europe, any more mods without reducing the number would essentially clutter the whole thing up.
<Toranaga> 20 mods is alot but to my understanding this site is growing very popular.
<RAWRity> Toranaga: and it's growing popular despite the fact we only have 2 official streams.
<Toranaga> Exactly.
<RAWRity> technically, if the mods felt like it, there'd be nothing until BMN, and nothering after euroshow
<Flyboy> Unnr: so...?
<Unnr> sundays tend to be lazy days without much happpening around here
<Flyboy> i see
<OneTrickPony> lazy days are good days
<Saturn> 08,01curses
<Saturn> 08,01federer won the game point
*Unnr shakes fist
<OneTrickPony> lol tennis
<Saturn> 08,01hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01that was really silly of federer
<Saturn> 08,01urgh

<JRP2234[Web]> that sad face from google chrome
<RAWRity> Hey, not to be mean, but...can people start coming up with more unique Usernames? I think RainbowDash_ is like the 29th iteration of somebody with Rainbow Dash in their name.
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<RainbowDash_> its for roleplay (he shoots he scores
<JRP2234[Web]> Saturn: (omegle: Best pony?) reply: SCIENCE
<FairysHuff> Don't look at me ^_^
<Ninjazz> Agreed.
<FairysHuff> FOR SCIENCE!
<RAWRity> Eventually it just gets to a point where they all just sort of melt together into one large mass of rainbows and egotism.
<Ninjazz> It's still better than just pony_####, though, right?
<RAWRity> Ninjazz: yes, but those people at least have the excuse of being new and not knowing what to name themselves.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't have an original name...
<RAWRity> didn't sya original.
<Dovakihn> wassup?
<RAWRity> said "unique" in that there aren't several other people with similar names
<Ninjazz> Nottin' much.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just put Crimson with phoenix together
<Barbetos> Hey Dovakihn
<Dovakihn> hi Barbetos
<Ninjazz> Limit on the Rainbow<InsertExtra>.
<Ninjazz> Basically.
<CrimsonPhoenix> if I wanted to be hipster and unique I would put up something like huuuh Vlachlorad
<CrimsonPhoenix> or something
<FairysHuff> What about RainbowFarts?
<Ninjazz> Those kind of names are weird. >_<
<CrimsonPhoenix> the best internet name I saw was Ulilillia
<Ninjazz> hahaha
<RainbowSaturnDash> 08,01problem, RAWRity?
<RainbowSaturnDash> 08,01i wish there was a trollface emoticon

<RainbowSaturnDash> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: this
<Jim> DHN?
<RAWRity> I'm just saying. You're coming into a chat with a lot of people in it, you want to establish your presence as distinct from others'. You can't do that when there's Rainbow-Dash, Rainbow, DashWithRainbows, RainbowDash_, Dashie, MyLittleDashie,MyLilDash,Dashbowrain, DashofRainbow, and you're Rainb0wDa$h

<Sumica> 00,10lets not forget they check the news before they post it and they post events ontime
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 True. I just woke myself after a 4 hour nap.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What won me over is the RSS Feed
<RainbowSaturnDash> 08,01Sumica: aye, and they arent bitchy towards cknventions
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously if you run a news site you NEED an RSS feed
<ponibas> and me!!

<Bronysith> prince-dari: how was he video taped every step of the way
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: yup
<prince-dari> No idea
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: that comic is good enough to be canon and explains why Spike couldn't get a quill in Owl's Well That End's Well
<otakon> second guy on a rope
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, exactly
<FairysHuff> Groovy. I'm going to that to and my birthday is the sunday after. So may go back in to treat myself.

<BaconMane> 0,5>:I
<mitamaking> Silly Topper the south pole is in the south
<otakon> BaconMane: Robin Hood: Men in Tights THANK YOU!
<Chrysalis> why not Bacon?
<Bronysith> otakon: ahahha. bowel movement
<otakon> Bronysith: you get it! /)
<Bronysith> otakon: (\
<Biglaw> hey there BaconMane!
<Saturn> 08,01oh man, dan osma
<Chrysalis> otakon you do realise it was my win? :P
<Saturn> 08,01he was my brothers idol
<Sumica> 00,10But Bm is your initals
<Unnr> Hehehe, silky exterior
<FairysHuff> Saturn Your watching that vid too then ^_^
<mitamaking> Are any Mel Brooks movies worthy of being an A movie?
<otakon> Chrysalis: it was? nice
<otakon> mitamaking: Blazing Saddles ended up A once
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5635/ this is prince-dari
<otakon> but that was a technicality of the highest order
<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: what about of we incluse your middle names of David and Simon?
<Unnr> Problem is that Mel Brooks movies tend to have low budgets and are very refferential
<mitamaking> Oh relly, I would have put Young Frankenstein and maybe Space Balls as A also
<mitamaking> *really
<Unnr> so as a result its hard to rate them as A
<otakon> That megusta face is absolutely horrifying
<Saturn> 08,01BDSM is the joke here.
<BaconMane> 0,5Otakon: What are you talking about?
<BaconMane> 0,5Why u thanking me?
<Unnr> Young Frakenstein might be A, but that was really Mel Brooks giving Gene Wilder money
<otakon> BaconMane: no, I'm telling you I'm thanking Robin Hood: Men in Tights
<Sumica> 00,10if you have to explain it Saturn then it was a bad joke
<mitamaking> You mean Gene Wilder earning every penny?
<otakon> Unnr: Gene Wilder DESERVES EVERY SEPTIME!
<BaconMane> 0,5I dont get it otakon
<otakon> hiya Sumica
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: i know. i know.
<otakon> BaconMane: nvm
<Bronysith> http://ragecomics.memebase.com/
<otakon> just nvm...BM
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> whats going on
<Sumica> 00,10hi otakon
<Unnr> mitamaking: Young Frankenstein was Gene Wilder´s baby, but he couldn´t get money from the studios to make it. So he asked Mel Brooks for help (As they had worked together earlier on The Producers)
<otakon> :) how are you today Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10feeling rather chill
<otakon> Unnr: and it was (and is) MAGNIFICENT!
<mitamaking> Unnr: And the world is a better place because of it
<otakon> can't wait to watch it
<otakon> hell, if I had the money would have bought it from Family Dollar
<otakon> it was 5 bucks
<Saturn> 08,01gene wilder is hilarious
<otakon> but I REALLY needed some new flip flops
<Chrysalis> wait... you needed flipflops
<Chrysalis> are in insane
<mitamaking> Let me save you a week, the best scene of the movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-aRwEbp5I
<Chrysalis> no one needs those things
<otakon> Saturn: honestly think Willy Wonka was his best work.
<Chrysalis> they should all burn in that special place of hell
<otakon> Chrysalis: it's HOT out I do NOT want to wear socks.
<Chrysalis> reserved for pedophiles
<otakon> he's gone
<otakon> dat autokick
<Yahooz> lawl
<Chrysalis> and people who talk at the cinema
<otakon> Chrysalis: LOL!
*BaconMane snickers
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i didnt like willy wonka; i grew up with dahls books, and the film was terrible
<BaconMane> 0,5*snicker*
<Ninjazz> lol
<mitamaking> otakon: I agree but Young Frankenstein is Brook's best movie
<ScootaChicken> BaconMane: Sup?
<otakon> Saturn: wait, wait...the FIRST Willy Wonka movie was terrible?
<otakon> REALLY?
<Unnr> Willy Wonka as a film was bad, but I really Liked Gene Wilder as Wonka
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<FairysHuff> Saturn Same
<BaconMane> 0,5xD
<otakon> Saturn, FairysHuff you're both NUTS
<mitamaking> I can't believe you all, Willy Wonka is one of my favorite movies
<otakon> and having NOT read the books but it is one of my favorite movies
<panda-drawing> BaconMane oh... you're here ^-^
<otakon> What next, gonna tell me Jackson's Lord of the Rings was shoddy too?
*Bronysith le looks at BaconMane "ooh bacon!" noms
<BaconMane> 0,5Indeed I am!
<mitamaking> The books don't interest me, they sound quite... dumb
<mitamaking> otakon: Tom Bombadill 4 life
<FairysHuff> otakon Yes *troll face* ^_^
<panda-drawing> BaconMane i finished your drawing ^-^ its... hm... cute xD
<otakon> mitamaking: now that scene I did miss
<mitamaking> I know why he cut it, but I do wish he had shown up
<BaconMane> 0,5Orly?
<BaconMane> 0,5Show me ^^
<otakon> mitamaking: same
<otakon> SHOW US panda-drawing!
<otakon> still, LotR movies were pretty damn faithful otherwise
<panda-drawing> BaconMane uh... im still on my phone >.> its hard to post imgur links xD may i skype it to you?
<BaconMane> 0,5Sure thing ^^
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: youre not british, so you probably didnt grow up with his books
<Saturn> 08,01unless you did
<Saturn> 08,01otherwise, you dont understand
<RAWRity> they were as faithful as they could have been to the books and still be accessible to a mainstream audience.
<otakon> Saturn: I've read The Hobbit, I've read the LotR series
<Chrysalis> films are never failthful to the books
<otakon> RAWRity: thank you, exactly
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: no, i mean dahl
<Chrysalis> they are always shockingly poor adaptations
<otakon> Saturn: oh
<otakon> Chrysalis: um, no
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/09I31XwKkx0
<otakon> they are not
<Jim> omg I love Roald Dahl
<mitamaking> I am not looking forward to the Hobbit movie, if King Kong Jackson directs it
<BaconMane> 0,5Otakon x AASK
<RAWRity> Saturn: well, while Willy Wonka is certainly not a faithful adaptation, I feel it's a charming enough kid's movie on its own.
<panda-drawing> otakon and if mr bacon wants to post im sure he will ^-^
<otakon> mitamaking: I am
<Chrysalis> BaconMane thats hell of a pair there
<panda-drawing> Shizuka wb!
<Saturn> 08,01name one film adaptation that was better or as good as the book
<Chrysalis> quick, someone draw an OC with AASK for a cutie mark
<otakon> I WILL BURN THAT BOT ONE DAY!
<Bronysith> hi Shizuka
<mitamaking> If it is LotR Jackson it will be good, but King Kong was just too pretensious
<otakon> Saturn: dammit I know of one but cannot remember it.
<mitamaking> Saturn: Willy Wonka
<Saturn> 08,01Starship Troopers DOES NOT count
<RAWRity> Saturn: Hunger Games was better as a film.
<otakon> Saturn: dammit
<RAWRity> much better in fact.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: wait wat
<Saturn> 08,01because it was a pisstake
<Jim> Willy Wonka was a better book
<Bronysith> RAWRity: lololo
<Jim> And it's called Charlie and the chocolate factory
<FairysHuff> Saturn I hated Starship Troopers.
<Saturn> 08,01never seen or read hunger games, actually
<otakon> well
<Bronysith> Saturn: the book is fantastic
<otakon> not really a movie
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: heinlein fan?
<RAWRity> Bronysith: I'm totally serioius. Hunger Games worked far better as a film than it did as a book, partly because Collins was originally a TV writer.
<Chrysalis> Saturn its just an americanised Battle Royale with less awesome
<ponibas> Saturn ... Needful THings I thought was alright
<Chrysalis> and more idiot proofing of the story
<FairysHuff> Saturn Don't know who that is.
<otakon> but to be honest, the True Blood TV series is better than the books I think
<Bronysith> RAWRity: okay then
<mitamaking> To Kill a Mockingbird was just as good
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: he wrote the book on which Starship Trropers was very very very loosely based
<Saturn> 08,01mitamaking: ill give you that one
<otakon> and yes, I have read the Sooki Stackhouse novels AND seen the TV series to the end of the 2nd season
<otakon> which only really covers like 2 of the books
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: agreed
<RAWRity> Hunger Games was an alright book, and was translated to an above-average movie.
<mitamaking> But that is just because both are classics
<FairysHuff> Saturn Ah. Never read it. I just hated Starship Troopers on its own as a film. Felt it was really stupid.
<otakon> ah, NAZI'S IN SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RAWRity> and no, it's not an "americanized" Battle Royale. Anybody who says that either hasn't read the book, or hasn't read Battle Royale.
<Unnr> Saturn, an arguement can be made fo Mother Night
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: it was really stupid. it was basically written as a pisstake of heinlein ingeneral
<otakon> also, this Song of a Earth Pony is really good actually
<mitamaking> Herculese was better as a Disney movie than a myth
<FairysHuff> Saturn WHys that?
<otakon> mitamaking: his myth's were more epic
<Saturn> 08,01mitamaking: oh frak off :P
<otakon> honestly, we need a SERIOUS Heracles movie
<Saturn> 08,01that is so not true
<otakon> NOT Hercules
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: yes!
<otakon> goddamn misspelling
<otakon> He's fucking CONAN of Greece
<Unnr> Otakon, we need more Kevin Sorbo
<Unnr> >_>
<otakon> no
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: ones roman, ones greek, i think
<mitamaking> I think myths are a bit overrated, except the Odysee
<GilDash> I like Starship Troopers as a film. Sod what you all say. :D
<RAWRity> otakon: unfortunately, that's not gonna happen. "Hercules" has become so engrained in western pop culture, a studio wouldn't go for it.
<mitamaking> Oh fine, Haraclese
<Bronysith> this guy is excellent with gmod http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayrNrP0KtOo
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: i liked it too, even just for the irony
<otakon> Saturn: Heracles(Hera's Bane IIRC) is Grecian, Hercules is Roman(they conquered the Greeks after all)
<otakon> RAWRity: God, if only it did though
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: aye
<GilDash> Saturn: Eh, I just love some cult films sometimes. :)
<mitamaking> Plus, Herc just sounds cool
<Symphony> Hello, everypony
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/OZ4c1X5ene8
<otakon> and a PROPER Dungeon's and Dragon's movie
*Unnr was sad that Starship Troopers: The Roughneck Chronicles never ended
<GilDash> Never did read the book though. Must rectify that.
<Jim> hi Symphony
<GilDash> Or any Heinlen, actually. :S
<otakon> FairysHuff: the hell?
<mitamaking> FairysHuff: I really want to watch that show
<RAWRity> I'm also of the opinion that Harry Potter & The Half Blood Prince was better in film than page.
<mitamaking> otakon: Anime based on The Odysee
<otakon> FairysHuff: no really, the FUCK?
<FairysHuff> mitamaking Watched that as a child ^_^
<alexxm> hey guys
<FairysHuff> otakon I'm ignoring you cause of your language.
<otakon> Okay, now THAT intro is the BIGGEST 80's THROWBACK EVER
<Jim> hi alexxm
<mitamaking> otakon: It's in the 31st century
<otakon> FairysHuff: but it's...my GOD it's so cheesy it's GLORIOUS
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm no stream
<Saturn> 08,01federer is going to win this
<otakon> hiya alexxm
<FairysHuff> otakon That it is. And I have more.
<mitamaking> I heard it's actually a good show
<RAWRity> oh hai Rarity http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/548479_10151144472175802_1147542185_n.jpg
<otakon> oh my god
<alexxm> hey Jim and otakon how have you been and is there a stream
<otakon> I think I've ACTUALLY watched that show
<Symphony> RAWRity: I always liked the series of books better as a whole myself. But I guess that's just cuz I have a vivd imagination.
<mitamaking> Okay some start streaming 80 cartoon intros
<Chrysalis> Saturn and its gonna take him 3 days to do it
<Jim> don't know, can't get the stream from where I'm at
<otakon> no stream for me
<otakon> I've refreshed twice now
<Unnr> Saturn, one movie that is inarguably better than the book
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/DcH_ZTF6smY
<Unnr> Blade Runner
<FairysHuff> Another from my childhood
<otakon> FairysHuff: seen it
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: ha! yes!
<otakon> FairysHuff: Luna showed it
<otakon> it was ...interesting to say the least
<Unnr> Mmm Harrison Ford
<FairysHuff> I still have more ^_^
<otakon> God, the Go Bots
<otakon> I had the MOVIE of them
<Saturn> 08,01mmm edward james olmos
<RAWRity> Symphony: nothing to do with imagination. the HBP film had a more structured and focused plot, without some of the more pointless scenes that padded the book.
<otakon> fun stuff to be honest
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/hLU1GfIIGLE
<Unnr> And soon bronystate will be gone, like tears in rain
<mitamaking> Unnr: Not if I can help it

<prince-dari> I hate anyone who says that
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I hate this song SOOOO MUCH
<ScootaChicken> Kickbots are on a roll yo.
<CK|Catnap> Dari has the reverse of a fetish for bad English.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT YOU KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS, GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE BRITS!
<prince-dari> It is just inherently ridiculous and wrong.
<FairysHuff> prince-dari *coudln't
<ScootaChicken> NO OTAKON.
<otakon> prince-dari: no, it's called language changes.
<GabeMoist> prince-dari, no one cares about that in this day in age
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> because ppl overreact like so..........................................
<ScootaChicken> GabeMoist: I do.
<Ninjazz> XD

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i love how writers made a plothole just for a song xD
<otakon> didn't Fry say something along those lines?
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla gasp Oo
<otakon> like..."Verbing the noun" or some such?
<Ninjazz> ...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> VioletVanilla: sounds something from Mass Effect 3 o_o
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Very much so
<Ninjazz> I swear I've heard something like this before...
<otakon> it sounds familiar again
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.

<GabeMoist> what the original song from exactly?
<VioletVanilla> 06Luna by Eurobeat Brony
*FairysHuff would head bang but for fear of getting another migraine ^_^
<prince-dari> Vi never ceases to surprise me with her talent.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Sir_Brony> and to a lesser extent girls because we all know women don't go on the interenet
<Meanwhile> What dari said.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would dance to this in a rave
*VioletVanilla hopes to go to a con in Amerika to play her musik like this
<GabeMoist> what con?
<RaveBrony> PLease do!
<Ninjazz> We would welcome you with open arms.
<GabeMoist> I need to know what to save up for
<GilDash> FairysHuff: Yeah, I was moshing just the other day. Bad neck, shoulders and head to show for it too. :D
<Nyria> This is amazing~
<CrimsonPhoenix> VioletVanilla, it'll be better than any dubstep we hear everyday
<RaveBrony> ^
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix, damn straight.
<GilDash> VioletVanilla: Come over to the UK too. :)
<FairysHuff> GilDash heheh Yeh I had to stop years ago ^_^ Shame. It's the only way I know to dance. LOL
<RaveBrony> Any music > dupstep
<CrimsonPhoenix> SEE EVERYPONY? You do not need to drop the bass to make good music
<GabeMoist> We need to get all the bronystate musicians to form a team
<RaveBrony> Yepyep
<otakon> but it WAS dropped
<Starflash> Yup.
<Ninjazz> YESH! <3
<otakon> then quickly picked up again

<Flyboy> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> LOVE IS IN BLOOM~
<RaveBrony> Apparently, im not intuned with the chat stuffs
<GabeMoist> I wonder who's gotten kicked more, otakon or Bjorn?
<otakon> RaveBrony: I got kicked by Wrek bot and then Sumica bot and then prince-dari bot.
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: otakon easily.
<Ninjazz> It's that other song that everyone loves so much but didn't win that award!
<RaveBrony> otakon: Oh, haha :D
<otakon> GabeMoist: me, over 80 in the lifetime of me beinng here.
<killerpony7733> otakon: You are making a sport out of it
<otakon> *being
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ninjazz, I wanted SMile to win
<otakon> killerpony7733: I hate being kicked it's aggravating
<CrimsonPhoenix> since you know, it's far more spectacular
<CCCP> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21449256?urlName=Slutty-Samus&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
<Nyria> otakon: I swear, it's because of your lag~
<Starflash> heh
<killerpony7733> otakon: Well lol
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix, I was going throught the flavor of the week thing. >.>
<Meanwhile> I doubt anyone comes close to otakon's number of kicks.
<Nyria> Knew it~
<otakon> OH COME ON!
<Lil_B> bye Starflash
<prince-dari> o:
<Ninjazz> Cya, Starflash. Take care.
<Malavolent> Good evening guys.
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Malavolent.
<Meanwhile> sonicandmario85: Fun fact, the kick script is a bot.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<FairysHuff> VioletVanilla Will you be streaming for a while? I have to go shopping which will take about an hour at least. ~_~
<Ninjazz> Oi. This sounds like Archie or something.
<VioletVanilla> 06Its Archie
<Ninjazz> Woo~
<GabeMoist> I don't think the dari kick was a bot
<seatsea> is it just me or there is no image?
<Meanwhile> dari kick is lag.
<otakon> sonicandmario85: they have bot scripts that auto kick on 6 messages in 10, however you can "stack" messages seperately so you enter 6=kicked, enter one upon entering again carries over to another kick and so forth
<otakon> seatsea: it's music
<Ninjazz> No image, seatsea.
<Ninjazz> Just sweet, sweet sound.
<otakon> it's Vi's Radio Show!
<otakon> One of the true highlights of this site :)
<CCCP> Is there a stream?
<RaveBrony> <3
<prince-dari> CCCP: Yes
<killerpony7733> CCCP music stream
<otakon> CCCP: eeyup, refresh dammit!
<Ninjazz> Can't disagree.
<Flyboy> most amazing song to walk into the room to
<GabeMoist> wub is in bloom
<CCCP> Oh
<Flyboy> :)
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: http://derpy.me/jKS5Z :3
<Meanwhile> Stream is currently limited to (Fantastic) audio.
<RaveBrony> CCCP: Youre missing the music! :[
<CCCP> I can't hear it ;(
<seatsea> could i have the link plz
<Meanwhile> >On chat.
<sagas> CCCP: turn up the volume?
<Meanwhile> >Not on the site.
<Meanwhile> >why
<seatsea> thanks
<FairysHuff> Right folks. I'm off to go food shopping. Hopefully VioletVanilla Will still be streaming when I return.
<Lil_B> see you soon FairysHuff
<CCCP> Sagas I dont even have the box thingy
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, okay. She's... brushing her mane. That's okay... I think. >.> *represses hate*

<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Ninjazz> Cya, FairysHuff. Take care.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Gracefully ^^
<otakon> bye FairysHuff take care!

<twilight_sprinkle> bye FairysHuff
<CCCP> Bye fairsyhuff
<RaveBrony> :O
<alexxm> bye FairysHuff
<GilDash> FairysHuff|Away: See ya! :)
<otakon> :) another remix :)
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix he rarely gets something doen, but when he does its usually good
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, I can think of a pony that can do so better, but that's just me. ^_^;
<CrimsonPhoenix> that videogame feel
<GabeMoist> I wish my computer could run Just Cause 2 multiplayer
<Dovah> shit it's sunday isnt it?
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: chiptune
<alexxm> for some reason this remix seems sad to me
<Ninjazz> <3
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: See? You're starting to like her :)
<Flyboy> :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, his latest, I hate it
<otakon> Dovah: eeyup
<Meanwhile> Dovah: eeyup.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, grrrr.
<Meanwhile> Dat identical message.
<Meanwhile> Oh, almost. I forgot otakon can't write full stops.
<Dovah> fuuuuuck i have so much research and crap to do to day but i no wanaa! :(
<otakon> Meanwhile: and no "You cannot post identical message" filter crap.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: It's okay, we've got a long way to go, denial is the first stage :)
<Malavolent> Anyway, if anyone here plays LoL: http://derpy.me/tbrTw
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix (I don't really like it eather, I'm just saying that its normaly well produced :) )
*Ninjazz huffs at Malavolent 'Naw, ah. She's worst pony"
<otakon> Meanwhile: there is NO point to periods all the time. Hell you missed ScootaChicken and prince-dari freaking over "I could care less about the dress" line in "This Day Aria" earlier.
<Meanwhile> Malavolent: Twisted Fate is best pony.
<prince-dari> That is not a small thing otakon.
<ScootaChicken> ^
<ScootaChicken> It's a crime against the English language.
<Meanwhile> It's "Couldn't care less"
<Meanwhile> Honestly.
<prince-dari> People like you who don't care are part of the reason all this bullshit ruining the langauge goes unchecked.
<otakon> prince-dari: in the realm of things to worry about, yes it it.
<Malavolent> Meanwhile: I agree, it's a nice drawing :)
<VioletVanilla> 06So I must ask, hearing Luna's Nightmare Night Masquarade, what song would you like to hear from me next? (:
<RaveBrony> O_o
<otakon> prince-dari: dude, language EVOLVES! just accept it.
<Ninjazz> Decisions. >_<
<GabeMoist> ScootaChicken, just like "day in age" instead of "day and age"?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> any stream?
<prince-dari> That's not evolution
<prince-dari> That's just wrong.
<otakon> VioletVanilla: anything you would like.
<ScootaChicken> ^
<prince-dari> There is a difference
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's language becoming stupid.
<Flyboy> winter wrap up of course
<Nyria> VioletVanilla: Whatever you want~
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla whatever you like :)
<alexxm> yep SeaponiesofLiverpool
<otakon> prince-dari: Stephen Fry would disagree with you
<otakon> HELL YEAH!
<prince-dari> I'll go and talk to him then
<seatsea> Yea
<RaveBrony> Oh snap!!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I only see darkness
<CrimsonPhoenix> I could care less, meaning she actually enjoys the dress to some degree
<Ninjazz> Good Ol' Days, eh?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Stephen Fry doesn't say 'Could care less'
<ScootaChicken> Point invalid.
<Nyria> Hooray, wunderbar choice~
<otakon> prince-dari: look up "Verbing the Noun" I think.
<xxMoopyxx> *moopy has joined chat* hey everypony
<seatsea> TOMBSTINE
<seatsea> tombstone
<Lil_B> hi xxMoopyxx

<Meanwhile> The day I hear Stephen Fry say "I could care less" is the day I peel my own face.
<otakon> hold on I'll find it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> pm for link and download code
<otakon> ScootaChicken: wait what?
<alexxm> SeaponiesofLiverpool this is a sound only stream video lags to much for the mod streaming
<prince-dari> What makes you think I care what Stephen Fry says anyway?
<otakon> Meanwhile: hold on
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla where did you learn to make music (especially working with software)?
<alexxm> hey xxMoopyxx hows your day been
<prince-dari> The only thing I care about is idiots shitting on my language.
<xxMoopyxx> good
<ScootaChicken> Kick snare kick snare kick snare kick snare kick snare kick snare kick snare kick snare
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey prince dari, do you want free brony music?
<VioletVanilla> 06Lil_B: I am classically trained on all instruments, I learned software by myself. .
<GabeMoist> prince-dari, like text speak?
<GabeMoist> VioletVanilla, ALL the instruments?
<otakon> I FOUND IT!
<prince-dari> GabeMoist: Text speak I can deal because it's not inherently wrong, just the shorthand is annoying to read.
<Meanwhile> Play ALL the instruments! c:
<otakon> prince-dari, Meanwhile, ScootaChicken: http://youtu.be/J7E-aoXLZGY
<prince-dari> "I could care less", however, is just bullshit
<prince-dari> otakon
<prince-dari> [19:04] <prince-dari> What makes you think I care what Stephen Fry says anyway?
<prince-dari> [19:04] <prince-dari> The only thing I care about is idiots shitting on my language.

<CCCP> http://memegenerator.net/instance/10373246?urlName=Slutty-Samus&browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=AllTime
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla wow Oo that makes me somehow confident that I may be able to make music self-trained :)
<Malavolent> White rage.
<otakon> prince-dari: JUST LISTEN TO IT.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: No video links during the stream.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: shush.
<Meanwhile> otakon: yeah no vid links in stream.
<Meanwhile> You know better.
<Ninjazz> ALL the English rage.
<VioletVanilla> 06In Uni, doing Musik I literally learned how to play every branch of instrument possible (:
<otakon> Meanwhile: you too! just watch and listen
<otakon> VioletVanilla: I'm sorry for the link, but I must enlighten these brits a bit.
<Malavolent> VioletVanilla: What instruments you can play?
<killerpony7733> CCCP: Not sure if disgusted or want
<VioletVanilla> 06Malavolent: CAN I play or DO I play?
<alexxm> CCCP who made that meme
<Meanwhile> otakon: YOU want to enlighten /anyone/? Pardon me while I go laugh a bit.

<otakon> Saturn: they're too tiny!
<GabeMoist> very few can master it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Winter Wrap-up was spectacular in season 1 and now we have this for season 2
<ScootaChicken> Nyria: I lived in England during the World Cup, what do you fucking think.
<Saturn> 08,01im going to be the token fat pinkie pie at buck
<Shizuka> 13vivi plays the wub, that is all that matters
<Meanwhile> shizu: Same kind of effect as the faq page.

<RaveBrony> Saturn: Pics!! :D
<otakon> Saturn: oh wait I read that wrong.
<VioletVanilla> 06Malavolent: I enjoy Piano the most. . . It was my first/original instrument. After that I would say Harp, then bass, percussion, cello, viola, flute, clarinet
<Nyria> ScootaChicken: Fair enough~
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: as?
<Lil_B> note to myself, get to an Universary now and learn everything I could never learn in this wasteland I call home

<RaveBrony> I wanna play the accordion ;_; Piano was not enough for me...
<VioletVanilla> 06Would you like a little piano musik?
<WallDives> I would.
<Malavolent> VioletVanilla: Whoa, how old are you? So many instruments...
<GabeMoist> VioletVanilla, now you just need to learn to play them all at once and play Pinkie's Polka
<ScootaChicken> Yus
<RaveBrony> Sure! :)
<Meanwhile> Yes please Vi.
<Starflash> yes please, VioletVanilla :D
<Ninjazz> You learned how to play all the instruments during Uni, VioletVanilla, or?... like before then?
<CrimsonPhoenix> >EQD: The worldwide leader in pony.
<Unnr> Harps are fun!
<WallDives> wish I could still play the piano...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Is there anyone else that is upset about this?
<Flyboy> SMIIIIIIIIILE!!!

<CrimsonPhoenix> EQD banner
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm not alone then
<WallDives> CrimsonPhoenix, as upsetting as ESPN calling themselves the worldwide leader in sports.
<Saturn> 08,01though, they have been pretty good to BUCK
<RaveBrony> alexxm: I concur
<VioletVanilla> 06Dumm lag. .
<GabeMoist> Everyone knows Bronystate is the real leader

*Ninjazz suddenly feels at peace
<otakon> I've been spending the last 10 minutes trying to get prince-dari and Meanwhile and ScootaChicken to UNRUSTLE THEIR COLLECTIVE JIMMIES about "I could care less" and it's improperness since apparently it RAPES the English language back to Latin...
<Flyboy> yay my fav beatles song!
<Ninjazz> lol
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<sonicandmario85> Here comes the sun*sun falls on me* AHHHHHHH IT BURNS!

<alexxm> that can't be godo
<Ninjazz> Okie Dokie... lokie.
<Flyboy> eeeeerm
<sonicandmario85> LAG
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Latin is far better than what you Americans have done to the English language.
<otakon> woah what?
<CK|Catnap> suddenly feedback of dewn
<CK|Catnap> *dewm
<Ninjazz> Remember, man. 'Murika.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: get off it for God's sake, you fish chomping blighter.
<Saturn> 08,01# at first i was afraid / i was petrified #
<GabeMoist> Didn't English come from Norse?
<prince-dari> Hey otakon.
<otakon> GabeMoist: came from Latin IIRC
<Saturn> 08,01# when pinkie dug a sharpened knife into my side #
<otakon> prince-dari: yes? o surly one?
<prince-dari> I could care less about Americans ruining our language.
<Saturn> 08,01sorry, i just had to; it was kicking about my head
<prince-dari> I.E. I do care an unspecified amount.
<Airpuff> Saturn.. wat?
<otakon> prince-dari: BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS I COULDN'T CARE LESS! YOU BROKE YOUR OWN RUL!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn you should write the whole song
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! :)
<prince-dari> MFW otakon fails
<otakon> hello Ponies47
<prince-dari> [19:27] <prince-dari> I.E. I do care an unspecified amount.
<prince-dari> You're an idiot.
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: the other night, one of my comittee told me that they'd been having it off with another member of the comittee
<Saturn> 08,01so i spent abotu 5 minutes writing alternative lyrics to Giggle at the Ghosties
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Ponies47.
<otakon> prince-dari: what amount? A iota? A smidgen? A peck? A BUSHEL? A LITER?!
<GabeMoist> otakon, I thought it came from Norse languages since it has a lot in common with other german languages
<OneTrickPony> hai Ponies47
<Meanwhile> otakon: 4 grams.
<prince-dari> You're kind of missing the point, aren't you otakon
<prince-dari> It's an unspecified amount, because that's what "I could care less means"
<CrimsonPhoenix> of it was on the giggle at the ghosties? I thought of I will survive
<otakon> prince-dari: no I'm sailing past it at high speed.
<Meanwhile> otakon: And straight off a waterfall.
<otakon> prince-dari: the point is JUST RELAX AND ENJOY THE SONG.
<Saturn> 08,01i sang it at the committee and... jaws dropped with disbelief that 1) they'd had the ol' rumpy pumpy and 2) i'd made up a song about it in 5 mintues
<otakon> Meanwhile: I've got floaty wings!
<Saturn> 08,01well, i say jaws dropped
<prince-dari> I am enjoying the song, the music on stream is a perfect calming background when arguing with idiots.
<otakon> Saturn: "rumpy pumpy"?
<Saturn> 08,01what really happened was that i almost ashpyxiated half the committee with laughter
*VioletVanilla hugs Dari <3
<GabeMoist> otakon, but sharp rocks are in your way
*prince-dari hugs Vi back <3
<AttacktheAndalite> Huh? What's everyone talking about?
<otakon> prince-dari: okay, NOW you just called me an idiot for trying to get you to just calm down about "I could care less" and i't improper usage...the hell man.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: rumpy pumpy.
<Lil_B> prince-dari all the languages are getting ruied :/ even in my small village people are starting to speak german with random english words just thrown into it... I blame the TV
<Shizuka> 13why are ponies arguing...
<WallDives> dont know.
<Shizuka> 13why are we not just listening to vivi's wonderful music..
<Meanwhile> Because language is serious buisness.
<WallDives> music is more important.
<BronyInstrumental> i don't like arguing....
<killerpony7733> ^This
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez ^-^
<Meanwhile> And we /are/ listening.
<Unnr> English is a language that is a mix of French and Germanic
<Saturn> 08,01"i could care less" establishes an upper bound of caring
<TrixieMuffin> couldn't care less : to care the planck amount , because caring less for all intents and purposes equals not caring at all
<Unnr> so Take Old Norse and Pump in a bit of Latin
<killerpony7733> Bicycle!
<CrimsonPhoenix> BIIIIIICYCLE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02BICYCLE
<Saturn> 08,01"i couldn't care less" is correct in its semantics, as it establishes a lower bound, which is the intention of the phrase
<Ninjazz> Bicycle.
<OneTrickPony> Bicycle!
<Shizuka> 13HOYLE
<Shizuka> 13wait
<Meanwhile> Hoyle?
<WallDives> cards.
<Shizuka> 13BEE
<Shizuka> 13no..
<alexxm> bicycle
<otakon> Shizuka: I'm not arguing, was trying to get prince-dari to unrustle his jimmies about "I could care less" and that's it's improper. But it's apparently a HUGE affront to the English language warranting death and dismemberment by angry hedgehogs...
<WallDives> Shizuka got jokes.
<Shizuka> 13yeah bicycle
<AttacktheAndalite> Um...hi everyone?
<ScootaChicken> 'And I don't like Star Wars'
<OneTrickPony> hai AttacktheAndalite

<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: no idea, ask VioletVanilla

<GabeMoist> Saturn, will you get some honey out of it?
<otakon> I got no hooves
<VioletVanilla> 06I am going to play Luna's Nightmare Night Masquarade as an encore, followed by some other dancing tracks (:
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Bullet ants
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: i will get a *lot* of honey out of it
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: the hell is a Bullet Ant?
<Saturn> 08,01abotu 50kg - 60 kg
<Ponies47> Wait who's streaming music anyways? 6_9
<GabeMoist> otakon, the most painful insect
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Let me find it
<Saturn> 08,01and that's just from one hive
<Meanwhile> otakon: It's an ant with a sting equated on the pain scale to being shot.
<otakon> Saturn: WHAT?! How many bee's are you getting?
<VioletVanilla> 06Ponies47: I am~
<otakon> Meanwhile: O_O
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: 1 hive
<Ninjazz> SOME ONE PLEASE RECORD IT THIS TIME.
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha: yay! :3
<otakon> Saturn: and that much honey?
<GabeMoist> otakon, they sheik and have a bite that feels like a bullet
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Oh, and their screech is like a banshee before it stings
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<GabeMoist> *shriek
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: woah
<VioletVanilla> 06Ninjazz: Shhh~ I will be releasing it, along with others soon. . . c:
<otakon> please tell me their in the deepest parts of the Amazon
*Ninjazz squees
<Starflash> :D
<otakon> yay!
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: I know right? Too bad I can't find a video of a bullet ant's shreikings
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: it's somewhere
<Meanwhile> otakon: The natives where they are from use the ants in their coming of age ritual.
<Saturn> 08,01when i split the hive off, i'll have 2 hives
<VioletGreySha> Ponies47: wrong ping :P
*Ninjazz attempts to get his body ready... but fails
*VioletVanilla hugs VioletGreySha
<Flyboy> Saturn: what you talking about?
<Saturn> 08,01and i'll need to name another queen...
<CrimsonPhoenix> welp
<Saturn> 08,01i shall call her Vivi
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: That giant one-inch wasp from Indonesia or Malaysia
<TrixieMuffin> name her Chrysalis
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn name it Saturn!
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: bees
<Meanwhile> Saturn: saw that coming from space.
<otakon> AttacktheAndalite: ah
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: indeed
<VioletVanilla> 06Dance dance~
<Saturn> 08,01well
<Flyboy> Saturn: any reason why?
<Lil_B> Ninjazz nobody gets his body ready like Reaggie
<Starflash> Yusss
<GabeMoist> There's also an ant that travels in packs and has dismantled entire horses
<CrimsonPhoenix> Head is bobbing here
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: why naming her Vivi, or why bees?
<Meanwhile> otakon: They sew the ants into a pair of gloves with the stingers facing inward and then wear them for several minutes.
<Flyboy> Saturn: Why bees
*Lil_B dances more awkwardly than Twilight
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: because i love bees
<otakon> Meanwhile: O_O JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST ON THE CROSS!
*Ninjazz wiggles his arms around
<Flyboy> Saturn: ok then, carry on
<Zetheross> hello everypony\
*otakon does the truffle shuffle.
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: and i keep them
<otakon> hiya Zetheross
<Lil_B> hi Zetheross
<Saturn> 08,01to produce sweet, sweet honey
<Meanwhile> Allo Zetheross
<TrixieMuffin> OH NO NOT THE BEES! AAAAH THEY'RE IN MY EYES!
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha: Oops. I made that mistake again. It's happened before but not just to me. :$
<otakon> brb guys need a drink
<Lil_B> VioletGreySha hi there :)
<Saturn> 08,01bees are actually quite docile
<Meanwhile> ^
<Saturn> 08,01unless you piss them off
<Starflash> Yer
<Zetheross> does anypony know where or how you post a fanfic of mlp?
<Meanwhile> Bees die when they sting.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, unless they're Africanized
<GilDash|Dinner> Saturn: Unlike wasps. =_=
<Ponies47> Bee's scare me :(
<GilDash|Dinner> GabeMoist: Or that. :D
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash|Dinner: wasps are bastards
<Lil_B> Bees are fine... I hate Wasps
<GabeMoist> Africanized bees hat humanity
<GilDash> Saturn: Yes, I know. :D
<Starflash> >steps on a wasp
<Meanwhile> Oooh...Africanised honey bees. Thos're just psychotic.
<GabeMoist> *hate
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Honeybees, at least
<Saturn> 08,01actually, hornets, which as basically large wasps, are also docile
<Starflash> and then it ruins your foot. great
<Cypresswolf> Im of the opinion bees never like me to begin with
<Saturn> 08,01so if you see an absolutely massive yellowjacket, it's just as likely to sting as a bee
<Ponies47> Bee's, wasps, ect I'm scared of :s
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, jsut as unlikely
<Saturn> 08,01also, bumblebees don't die when they sting
<Saturn> 08,01only honeybees
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: Depends on their aggression level.
<Zetheross> im scared of all stinging insects cause ive been swarmed 5 times in my life and after the 5th time im scarred for life done
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: also depends whether you're a horse
<Saturn> 08,01bees hate horses
<Saturn> 08,01i don't know why
<BronyInstrumental> it depends on how bullied they were during flight school!
<Saturn> 08,01horses just seem to rile up bees, in my experience
<Starflash> Heck yeah~
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: If they hate horses, imagine what they'll do to a pony
<alexxm> Zetheross any idea why you've been swarmed so many times
<Flyboy> Saturn: maybe its like cats and dogs
<Cypresswolf> Last couple of days, some wasps build a nest under the cover of the front porch - right above the door - I have to sneak out the back until I get some wasp spray
<Ninjazz> DANCE!
<Flyboy> Saturn: just incstint
<GabeMoist> Saturn, https://forums.playfire.com/_proxy/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.nextround.net%2Fupcoming%2Fthumbs%2F2010%2F03%2F25%2FThis-Is-A-MF-ing-Wasp.jpg&hmac=aec6ca0cbc067157b6423af81903f42b
<Zetheross> ive had my entire arms covered and such
*Ninjazz dances decently not great but decent
<AttacktheAndalite> VioletVanilla: oh em gee, this music is SOOO AWESOMESAUCE
<Meanwhile> Flyboy: I've always had cats and a dog in my house and I've never had an incident between either.
<Zetheross> alexxm well man i guess its just wrong place at wrong time
<Meanwhile> Cats are more likely to scrap amongst themselves than with the dog.
<Zetheross> alexxm 2 of the times my brother trew a hive at me
<Flyboy> Meanwhile: it depends. some cats and dogs are more tolerant than others
<TrixieMuffin> what was it ? 100 beestings can kill ahorse , but 1 horsebite can kill 100 bees ?
<alexxm> Zethross damn he sounds like an ass
<Zetheross> yea
<Meanwhile> Flyboy: I personally think cat and dog relations in cartoons aren't credible sources.
<Zetheross> ive had my face covered too after that i was done
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Lil_B> Ninjazz you are still a better dancer than me XD
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Everlasting_Joy.
<Zetheross> hello
*AttacktheAndalite is dancing in her chair
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, I really doubt that! XD
<AttacktheAndalite> hi Everlasting_Joy
*Lil_B hugs Everlasting_Joy
<Flyboy> Meanwhile: well most of the time they do exaggerate it but my dog hates cats, so i dunno.
<Lil_B> Ninjazz hey, I'm not a good dancer, you're not a good dancer, let's do some not good dancing together
<alexxm> hey Everlasting_Joy what have you been up to
<Zetheross> im sorry to ask again but does anypony know where to post or how to post up a fanfic?
<Cypresswolf> Meanwhile: I'll believe it - I have 2 cats that cant be in the same room for any length of time - but both will hang out with the dogs if the other cat isnt there
<alexxm> Zetheross i suggest FIMfic
<Meanwhile> Zetheross: Try FiMfiction.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Ninjazz and Lil_B!
<Zetheross> thanks guys
<Ponies47> Ohai Lil_B :)

<Everlasting_Joy> Irish_Pony: :D Your Ghosties comment.
<Lil_B> To be honest... our english Teacher (born scotsmann) would never mark "I could care less" as wrong...
<alexxm> Zethross i guess
<prince-dari> Then he's a terrible English teacher.
<otakon> ingwaz: prince-dari, Meanwhile and ScootaChicken went into "Jimmies rustled" mode over "I could care less" in "This Day Aria" that played earlier. I tried to calm them down about it, but THE RULES OF THE ENGLISH LANGAUGE ARE CONCRETE AND DEATH TO ALL THOSE WHO MISUSE IT!
<Zetheross> mmk im off to play league later everypony!
<Irish_Pony> VioletVanilla: I swear if you John Mayer I will love you to death :D

<otakon> Bronysith: yeah, you missed the Great Rustling of British Jimmies in the year of our Lord 2,012.
<prince-dari> People being who?
<GabeMoist> Jimmies were rustled all around
<Meanwhile> Come back to Ghostbusters. Nice.
<alexxm> hey Bronysith hows your day been
<otakon> Meanwhile: agreed.
<Bronysith> otakon: damn, cause you know what. i like the lyrics and stuff to this day aria. i just dont like the singer
<Lil_B> One does not simple play This Day Aria, without rustling somebodys Jimmies
<Bronysith> Lil_B: i love you
<otakon> Bronysith: yeah, the improper use of "I could care less" has made prince-dari hate the song now.
<otakon> XD
<Bronysith> otakon: YES
<GabeMoist> We need more jimmies to be rsutled
<otakon> that's like 2 memes in one.
<otakon> it's MEMECEPTION!
<Meanwhile> I still like the song but I wish they'd gotten the grammar right.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: thats another on the hate train of this day aria

<Meanwhile> Inb4 goddamnit

<Lil_B> ok in that case I will now proceed to speak german
<otakon> DO WHAT DAMMIT?
<Lil_B> ... is that Vivi on the Bass?
<otakon> I missed that
<otakon> Lil_B: I think so

<Meanwhile> That's got to be a personal record.
<GabeMoist> otakon, you're getting the electric chair tomorrow

<otakon> ouch?
<CrimsonPhoenix> GabeMoist, calm down it's only a rumor
<GabeMoist> that's not cool
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: not a thing
<Meanwhile> Bronysith you need to stop eating things in /me.
<Lil_B> I like TANK, but I can't hear anything atm
<Celes_Chere> I now have an urge to watch freakazoid :/
<otakon> GabeMoist: no, he's ASKING if anyone knows anything.
<FairysHuff> I RETURN! With food... Only for me though.
*Bronysith clones FairysHuff s food
<otakon> Lil_B: turn up your volume and refresh.
<Celes_Chere> Which is funny because this song is nothing like that
<sonicandmario85> *goes inside of some random guy and eats out their insides*
<Lil_B> FairysHuff you are late... I hope she will continou playing
<otakon> FairysHuff: it's Tank! also Vi Radio Show is still going.
<otakon> Celes_Chere: that was the beat line obviously
<GabeMoist> otakon, seemed like he was asking if any one was aware of the fact
<FairysHuff> YAY! ^_^
<Ninjazz> Was Tank.
<Invi> Vivi http://derpy.me/H08Lp :)
<otakon> Celes_Chere: it's only ONE instrument

<Meanwhile> No lag on my end.
<otakon> VioletVanilla: yes and no
<Ninjazz> Enjoying? yes. Lag? Nope.
<FairysHuff> I took longer than expected as I had to take the long way to the shop because of some NEDs along the faster route.
<otakon> prince-dari: wait what?
<prince-dari> >set automatic response to PMs from muted use to: http://atheistatlarge.org/articles/uploads/2010/12/rev.dawgmaspatentedbutthurtcream.jpg

<Sumica> 00,10did dar get buthurt over somthing I take it.
<otakon> prince-dari: wait who did you mute?
<Everlasting_Joy> VioletVanilla: There's no lag on this end.
<otakon> Sumica: he got upset over "I could care less" in This Day Aria
<GabeMoist> Sumica, dari's jimmies have been rustled
<otakon> Severely
<Ninjazz> Over a lyric line.
<otakon> Well, he's British
<Everlasting_Joy> I love how everyone is using "Rustled Jimmies" :).
<otakon> they get rustled over the wrong tea in the morning
<CrimsonPhoenix> Everlasting_Joy, how so?
<FairysHuff> prince-dari If its about the language issue that started just before I left earlier, then I agree.
<Ninjazz> o_o
<Invi> awesome :)
<Jim> That really rustled my me-mies
<Meanwhile> otakon: Black tea is best tea.
<FairysHuff> VioletVanilla I'm an 80s child so I must hug thee ^_^
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: /)
<FairysHuff> VioletVanilla *Hugs*
<VioletVanilla> 06Lag on bass?
<Everlasting_Joy> CrimsonPhoenix: I love goofy, off, weird, obscure, etc. lines. Yes, I'm aware of the gorilla, but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the phrase.
<otakon> FairysHuff: it's over "I could care less about the dress" and how it should have been "I COULDN'T care less for the dress"
<Meanwhile> Because it should have been that.
<Lil_B> imagine Vivi playing the bass right know... Why do I get a Scott Pilgrim Vs The world: The Movie Picture in my head?
<otakon> Meanwhile: I like Orange Pekoe/Black blends myself for everyday drinking cold or hot.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Everlasting_Joy, You have put a small smile to my grim face
<FairysHuff> otakon Yup cause I COULD care less is just stupid talk.
<otakon> FairysHuff: you too?
<Meanwhile> otakon: You're wrong. Get over it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Reddit had yet to touch the gorilla as far as I know
<Everlasting_Joy> CrimsonPhoenix: Better then what I was expecting.
<FairysHuff> otakon Yes. It doesnt make logical sense.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<otakon> IT IS LITERALLY AN APOSTROPHE(sp?) AND TWO LETTERS! GET OVER IT!
<VioletVanilla> 06anypony? lag. . ?
<Meanwhile> VioletVanilla: Nope, no lag.
<otakon> VioletVanilla: enope, not really
<Everlasting_Joy> VioletVanilla: None on my end.
<GilDash> otakon: That makes that sentence make logical sense. :)
<FairysHuff> otakon It changes the whole meaning.
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, that small details brought a whole new meaning
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: it is leaving off an entire word actually, due to the nature of contractions
<CrimsonPhoenix> It says how Chrysalis actually likes the dress when she meant the oposite
<ACS13123> VioletVanilla: all I got is music and chat... which isnt changing,,,
<Lil_B> no lags so afr VioletVanilla
<otakon> FairysHuff: except you STILL understand what the sayer means, therefore it still translates as the sayer intended it to, therefore IT DOESN'T BUCKING MATTER!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kinda ironic I think
<Lil_B> ACS13123 hi :), here have some Chats
<FairysHuff> otakon It does matter cause it makes the speaker seem like a complete moron.
<prince-dari> Ok everyone, otakon is now a synonym for "idiot", you all understand what I'm saying, so it is valid and correct.
<prince-dari> >otakon logic
<Meanwhile> And since dari said it it must be canon.
<Ninjazz> This is funny.
<otakon> prince-dari: and 'prince-dari' is a synonym for 'stubborn pretentious wanker'
<Chrysalis> true dat Dari
<CrimsonPhoenix> Anyway guys how about we speculate random stuff over a picture instead?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1341774011794.jpg

<Meanwhile> dari's face through this whole thing. http://i.imgur.com/EGJum.jpg
<prince-dari> Huehuehuehue
<otakon> sprinkle_GS17: it's apparently a unforgivable sin of language that prince-dari can't get over.
<GabeMoist> I think we should go back to Beowulf era english
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i was thinking along the lines of eduard khils face
<Meanwhile> Verily.
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, to modern
<GabeMoist> *too
<GabeMoist> Beowulf era
<Meanwhile> Forsooth?
<sprinkle_GS17> otakon: well yeah, it is a stupid saying that annoys me as well, but not that much
<AttacktheAndalite> What's going on now?
<Ryunosuke> I do believe he means vidctoria era
<Ryunosuke> *victoria
<GabeMoist> 	oðþæt him ǣġhwylc þāra ymbsittendra
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon
<Ryunosuke> Prithee thee, how doest thou fare on this good day?

<GabeMoist> yes]
<otakon> prince-dari: can we please stop with the 'otakon=idiot' nonsense now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes Lil_B you killed it
<Lil_B> thats bad :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon do you want to come back with shipping?
<otakon> it's not a meme
<prince-dari> Well, if you'll admit that the argument of "you understand it so it's right" doesn't make sense.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cheerilee's a whore
<prince-dari> Otherwise it's perfectly valid.
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I go for a self defense verdict
<otakon> prince-dari: no it DOES make sense
<GabeMoist> expected the other song from the video
<otakon> you're just LABELING me an idiot
<Braviary> So, anything on right now?
<Meanwhile> otakon: But dude, you are an idiot.
<Everlasting_Joy> I say!
<prince-dari> Ok then, if that makes sense, what I'm saying makes sense too.
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon trolling is a art
<Bronysith> prince-dari: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3q0m6d/
<Braviary> I hear music, but the video isn't loading. :/
<prince-dari> There is no video.
<GabeMoist> all the good ones are tekken

<FairysHuff> I would just like to say this one thing - "I COULD'NT care less" ^_^ *Troll face*
*Ninjazz won't make shizu sad
<Chrysalis> noo, no sad shizu
<Shizuka> 13you do not want to make shizu sad >:I

<Lil_B> MEINE BLUMEN!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <otakon> goddammit
<otakon> VioletVanilla: it is not.
<Ponies47> Shizuka: My singing voice is awful! ;s
<Ponies47> :s
<ACS13123> Then again, could be worse...
<Bronysith> aaaaaaaaaaaand
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the could care less about the dress being a terrible line that factor the quality of the song is still a fact that you should accept otakon
<killerpony7733> Gaaah stupid buffer
<otakon> could be ScootaChicken singing
<otakon> :P
<Celes_Chere> Spike! the bachelor party is -before- the wedding =_(\
<ACS13123> Its much better than the worst I've heard
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla voices are never bad, voices just need training like very other instrument :)
<Meanwhile> otakon: Could be you singing....euuurgh

*Ponies47 Crosses hoofs "Please be This Day Aria. Please be This Day Aria"

<Lil_B> Chat derped...
<Ninjazz> :c
<Meanwhile> Shizu: "Life"
<Chrysalis> Shizuka because they are inferior beings and need to make themselves feel more important than they are
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: idk, maybe, i havent played it
<CK|Catnap> I'm nice. D: But also a kitty so I guess I'm safe from that statement.
<sprinkle_GS17> Chrysalis: ^^^
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: it is fantastic, actually challenging and great combat. unlike skyrim
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Vats is for people who cant aim.
<sprinkle_GS17> Chrysalis: insulting others makes people feel above them
<turtlegod98> I just feel like choking myself...but i'm too scared to.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: heres your to do list today man http://trollfacecomic.com/post/26710742386/to-do-list
<CrimsonPhoenix> I didn't want to be mean at VioletVanilla
<FairsHuff|Busy> NO MY STREAM STOPPED!
<ScootaChicken> So otakon, let me ask again
<Everlasting_Joy> RX-78-SweetieBot: I thought those were aimbots.
<CrimsonPhoenix> She's awesome
<Meanwhile> Buffering?
<ScootaChicken> What was that about my singing?
<FairsHuff|Busy> And it's back ^_^ Phew
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: skyrim is challenging as well, all the enemies are the same level as you
<Meanwhile> There we go.
<Lil_B> whats the name of this song? I know someone who really like this kind of songs (me excluded, also I do like this too :) )
<VioletVanilla> 06CrimsonPhoenix: I do understand ^^ I get criticism all the itme
<otakon> ScootaChicken: nothing Neil, nothing.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Everlasting_Joy: Aimbots are for people who cant be arsed to even play the game.
<turtlegod98> anyone wana make a video?
<CrimsonPhoenix> sprinkle_GS17, really?
<turtlegod98> nope!
<Everlasting_Joy> RX-78-SweetieBot: :D Fair enough.
<ScootaChicken> <otakon>	could be ScootaChicken singing
<sprinkle_GS17> CrimsonPhoenix: ive been told so
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: not really challenging at all man. and when i mean challenging. i want my dark souls or demons souls difficulty
<ScootaChicken> EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cause I raid a lot of camps pretty damn easily
<turtlegod98> so weird, i know...
<Shizuka> 13es ist not founded though... it is always ponies being mean..
<Meanwhile> VioletVanilla is a big pony und she doesn't need shining armour.
<Shizuka> 13lay off of otakon please
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: well when a woman and a table love eachother very much
<otakon> ScootaChicken: it's called humor, develop some or you'll find the world a cold place indeed.
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: i dont want it to be rage-inducing-hard
<Meanwhile> He is soooooo pissed.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Or, in your case, a very laggy place.
<prince-dari> [20:29] <ScootaChicken> EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: if you like thatstuff you should play japanese mario
<Kandarihu> I'm hearing audio but getting no video. That's wierd.
<prince-dari> Explain youself
<prince-dari> Wha yu mean
<otakon> Kandarihu: it's Vi Radio Show.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: working as intended.
<prince-dari> When yu say half-caste
<prince-dari> yu mean when picasso
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: i like fair hardness. which is what demons souls is
<prince-dari> mix red an green
<Kandarihu> I see. Okay.
<prince-dari> is a half-caste canvas?
<Lil_B> whats the name of this song?
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/26643800672/memes-nutella-submitted-by-trolololologuy
<turtlegod98> I'f you think i'm the most stupidest,incompitant and ramdomest person on the face of the planet then respond to this post.
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: i play for fun, dont want it to be too hard
<otakon> prince-dari: wait..what? That is some segmented sentence fragments there.
<prince-dari> INB4 no one understand reference
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: hard is fun
<VioletVanilla> 06Dance Yrself Clean - LCD Soundsystem
<otakon> thank you VioletVanilla :)
<Meanwhile> Rather understandably actually. His mum got arrested the other day and is currently not allowed in the house for two months.
<Lil_B> VioletGreySha thanks~~<3
<turtlegod98> no one?
<FairsHuff|Busy> Could we have more 80s music VioletVanilla ? ^_^
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: thats why i love the ninja gaiden 1 and 2 on xbox. so hard and satisfying once you beat it
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: for you maybe. i like tricky hard, not something so hard id get stuck on ti forever
<otakon> turtlegod98: enope
<Chrysalis> prince-dari its a poem
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 whats up bro
<Chrysalis> had to study it for english
<prince-dari> Inderdaad
<Lil_B> VioletVanilla thanks~~<3
<otakon> wait
<turtlegod98> oh...well that's kind.
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: demons souls IS tricky hard
<otakon> THAT was a poem?
<Chrysalis> there is no faster way to make something lose significance than to study it in education
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also another thing I would like to put. ragecomics are unoriginal, unhumourous, annoying and an insult to creativity.
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: well so is skyrim
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: Explain yurself, what yu mean, when yu say half-caste, yu mean tchaikovsky, sit down at dah piano
<Starflash> prince-dari.. dat dutch
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: ahhahahha no
<Lil_B> sry VioletGreySha ... I made one Tap too less :/
<otakon> prince-dari: and you're pissed about "I could care less.."? THAT was a affront to the english language
*Vordox poplocks
<VioletGreySha> Lil_B: its ok :3
<Lil_B> wait prince-dari "Inderdaat" is dutch?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, should play fighting games online
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: fighting vampires is certainly not easy on the first levels
<Starflash> Lil_B, Inderdaad. not t.
<FairsHuff|Busy> otakon you mean *an
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: um no
<otakon> FairsHuff|Busy: I thought you were busy...
<prince-dari> otakon: It was a poem
<ScootaChicken> otakon: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Caste_%28poem%29
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, why not? it's the biggest challenge you could get
<ScootaChicken> Stop being an otakon.
<xxMoopyxx> So whos going to stream next?
<Saturn> 08,01TROUSERS SUCCESSFULLY DYED
<otakon> prince-dari: and yet poems aren't bound by the CONCRETE RULES OF OBSIDIAN STONE ENGLISH!
<Bronysith> sprinkle_GS17: skyrim is incredibly easy. that is why so many mainstream gamers play it and think it is actually good
<Starflash> Gratz Saturn :D
<Chrysalis> welcome to the UK http://i.imgur.com/WHSSr.jpg
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: i like my rpgs
<Lil_B> Starflash Dutsch and German are so similar sometimes :/ the resemblence is even freakier when you compare some german accents with dutch
<xxMoopyxx> Oh no
<otakon> Bronysith: but I like Skyrim. I also liked Dark/Demon's Souls
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: There's a line I never thought I'd read/hear in my life.
<killerpony7733> Saturn: What color?
<GabeMoist> otakon, obsidian is quite weak, actually
<Starflash> Lil_B: true :D
<Kandarihu> So, Yonkou Fansubs is shutting down.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, you played Disgaea?
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: hard =/= good game
<FairsHuff|Busy> otakon I am simply not watching the chat closely as it's moving too fast.
<CrimsonPhoenix> or whatever it's spelled
<Bronysith> otakon: well the souls games provide actual good fun and interesting combat
<RX-78-SweetieBot> sprinkle_GS17: Bronysith hate skyrim because he percieves it to be "mainstream". From there he just decides that everything about it is worse, even though its barely different from Oblivion in most ways. This is an arguement you cant win.
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/WHSSr.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/WHSSr.jpg
<Starflash> To be honest, I can't understand a part of my family that speaks a very heavy swäbisch kind of accent, Lil_B ~
<ScootaChicken> G#5 C#5 F#5 C#5 G#5 F#5, don't wanna be an American otakon.
<Chrysalis> lol Saturn i just linked that
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<GilDash> Saturn: Seems like a good deal.
<Jim> Saturn, I'll take 5
<Shizuka> 13Lay off of otakon please.
<Shizuka> 13It is getting annoying.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<xxMoopyxx> Hey saturn i want to you to see how you can show the chatroom to us on the screen i just wanted to see how long
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when laying off of otakon.
<Ninjazz> Sweet home Alibama.
<ScootaChicken> Aww
<sprinkle_GS17> RX-78-SweetieBot: ah, k. i wont waste time on it too much then, i mtoo busy celebrating today anyway :3
<Saturn> 08,01what're people doing to otakon?
<Shizuka> 13ponies are not helping then
<CrimsonPhoenix> sweet home alabama?
<FairsHuff|Busy> Shizuka Is that argument still going?
<prince-dari> If otakon lays off the English language.
<prince-dari> Do ho ho.
<Ninjazz> They're being mean to otakon.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: kekeke
<GabeMoist> inb4 dari gets banned
<Meanwhile> Saturn: All the result with none of the fun.
<Bronysith> prince-dari is the trolololo guys reincarnation
<sprinkle_GS17> Saturn: uber-trolling, you know, the usual
<Chrysalis> Saturn were just reinforcing prince-dari's decision
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: Ban a mod. Sounds legit.
<Chrysalis> the replace the word idiot, with otakonb
<otakon> prince-dari: I would say something very nasty to you, but I'm above that.
<sprinkle_GS17> yeah that would be pretty mean.
<Meanwhile> Such is human nature.
*Saturn 08,01hugs otakon
<Shizuka> 13I said.
<Shizuka> 13Lay off of otakon.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when she said?
<sprinkle_GS17> Shizuka y u ninja me
<otakon> Eh I'm okay
<xxMoopyxx> saturn i want you to pull up the chatroom and see how long you can have it on the screen
<Shizuka> 13Or I start kicking people for harassment.
<Chrysalis> http://i.imgur.com/udcN8.jpg see its cheap now, spread it everyone
<Lil_B> Meanwhile whos gondor anyway?
<otakon> I was wrong in 'proper usage' and all that
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Gondor, the city from Lord of the Rigns.
<otakon> but it's still a very nitpicky point.
<Meanwhile> Rings*
<Saturn> 08,01xxMoopyxx: i... already have the chat on my screen
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not doing this blind
<ScootaChicken> Chrysalis: Only 4.99?
<Jim> it's weird how dari actually is the one who started the otakon argument
<ScootaChicken> Ehhh
<Chrysalis> yup
<otakon> dammit I'm broke.
<ScootaChicken> Still a bit expensiv
<ScootaChicken> *expensive
<xxMoopyxx> oh well ok

<Saturn> 08,01urgh, bugger

<Bronysith> prince-dari: http://trollfacecomic.com/post/26350876439
<Saturn> 08,01bloody windows...
<GabeMoist> This seems familar
<prince-dari> Well I couldn't ignore the "I could care less" in the song, and apparently otakon can't accept that I hate it for that reason.
<Meanwhile> Naw, otakon started the otakon argument in skype.
<xxMoopyxx> wait let me back out real quick
<Cypresswolf> not even at that price would I buy love - my love is free :)
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: i'm on my mother's laptop and it pastes when i right click
<ScootaChicken> otakon, you can't afford loooooooooooooove?
<otakon> Nope
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, the buttons aren't swapped round on the mouse

<ScootaChicken> I don't care too much for money
<ScootaChicken> Cos money can't buy me love
*Chrysalis is too
<otakon> ScootaChicken: no but it can buy you sense of mind.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: do you use the buttons swapped round on your mouse?
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: You 'aint spending it right.

*Rainbow punches pinka

<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<otakon> ScootaChicken: nice...I think.
<FairsHuff|Busy> Saturn DIdn't you know left handed people are the spawn of the devil? Thats what the religious nutcases in the US say. And I'm inclined to believe they're infallable logic. ^_^
<hen3ry> It's not black. It's very very very very dark gray
<Bronysith> xxMoopyxx: cause the video is of a black black bear
<GabeMoist> FairsHuff|Busy, wat?

<Saturn> 08,01FairsHuff|Busy: that's what they used to say in the UK too
<Saturn> 08,01they used to forse left handers to write with their right hands
<xxMoopyxx> Oh can you fix it?
<otakon> Bloody religious nutters
<FairsHuff|Busy> Saturn Very true
<Jim> But why is the rum gone?
*Rainbow flys into pinka
<hen3ry> Now now, fewer than 50% of religious nutjobs today actually believe lefties are satan's love babies.
<Chrysalis> however, left handed people are generally smarter and more successful in life
<Chrysalis> same with people who are taller
<Chrysalis> though they dont live as long
<FairsHuff|Busy> I'm actually surprised some of you didn't know about this left handed demon spawn thing.
<GabeMoist> I've never heard anyone say anything like that about left handed people
<otakon> Chrysalis: or maybe that's just tricks with statistics?
<Jim> A lot of lefthanded people die from using right hand equipment every year
<Jim> FACT
<Sumica> 00,10ahhhhh did Vivi stop?
<hen3ry> especially toothbrushes. We need more left handed toothbrushes xD
<alexxm> i never heard of the left handed people are evil thing either

*Rainbow holding down pinka
<Rainbow> VioletGreySha: shot her
<FairsHuff|Busy> Saturn Write a song about how great it is to be left handed and evil.
<Kandarihu> Well, left handedness usually means that the right hemisphere of the brain is dominant.
<Chrysalis> suddnely coughing
<prince-dari> I am indeed, very stubborn.
<Saturn> 08,01i'll get one of you deutschlanders to correct my grammar

<CrimsonPhoenix> are you listening?
<CrimsonPhoenix> What if
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hahahha. yes, my bald shiny head shall blind you to death
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I say what if
<otakon> Chrysalis: the ONE good thing to come out of that place.
<Meanwhile> Saturn: American English. Hahahahaha no.
<Lil_B> I think he gave up now
<EmmettBrown> I SAID HI GUYS!
<Lil_B> hi EmmettBrown
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: do you always use the correct genetive case when you talk?
<Sumica> 00,10dari has never heard of sacrafise meening just to make the words ryme
<GabeMoist> My voice could never reach that
<otakon> hiya EmmettBrown you missed the GREAT rustling of british jimmies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fighting is Magic is at EVO 2013 as a tourney
<sprinkle_GS17> Saturn: im pretty sure hes just trolling at this point
<Ponies47> Meh if you don't like This Day Aria Bronysith . Okie doki loki then :)
<Ninjazz> Sumica... Where have I heard that before.
<hen3ry> Sweetiebot must teach him
<EmmettBrown> What happened Otakon?
<Ninjazz> Of course.
*Twilight_S claps
<Vordox> XD
*Ninjazz donks his head
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"I couldn't care less about the dress."
<Ponies47> So many mods talking today. 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: if you never use the word "whom", then you cannot comment on the correctness of language
<Bronysith> prince-dari: http://i.imgur.com/HLQlh.jpg
<prince-dari> Saturn: Genetive case? Such a thing doesn't exist
<prince-dari> Do ho ho. :P
<Vordox> Now I thought of Pinkie's Mouth stretching....
<sprinkle_GS17> Great Scott, its EmmettBrown !
<EmmettBrown> Is it normal for super mario sunshine to go slow on emulator?
<Vordox> VioletVanilla: Try the Gypsy Bard song! From FiW. ^^ That voice will be hard.
<Everlasting_Joy> If this pointless argument is going to continue, I'm going to take off.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really want to main rairty even though she's coplicated
<otakon> VI BRO! DO YOU HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL?
<Meanwhile> ^
<Ponies47> Any pony going to Canterlot Gardens in September? :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I wonder if there's a way to remove the announcer voice
<otakon> dammit I hear nothing
<Saturn> 08,01to use "who" in the phrase "for whom" is technically wrong, though it's now accepted as correct. as i say, language evolves, sometimes in ways that are technically incorrect, even semantically.
<Meanwhile> The sound of silence.
<otakon> there we go
<otakon> dammit it keeps cutting out it seems
<sprinkle_GS17> btw prince-dari , how many heroes eps have you streamed the last two days? iv been away so i want to know how much i need to catch up on
<otakon> YES!
<Vordox> I think you should try some fan voice acting :P
<otakon> THERE WE ARE!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, this makes me hate the world we live in
<otakon> XD
<prince-dari> In the last two day I don't think I've streamed any.
<otakon> :P YES!
<EmmettBrown> IS IT NORMAL FOR SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE TO RUN SLOW ON AN EMULATOR
<CrimsonPhoenix> We have the same problem in french
<otakon> EmmettBrown: yes
<Ponies47> No answer so I'll take that as a no. :( Me it's a MAYBE! I just might make it to Canterlot Gardens! :3
<sprinkle_GS17> prince-dari: ah good, thx
<Flyboy> I Came... To This City
<Meanwhile> EmmettBrown: Don't know, don't care. You lost me at Super Mario.
*kirzstryfe facehoofs
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: you'd rather be speaking anglo-saxon?
<otakon> VI BRO! DO YOU HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL?
<CrimsonPhoenix> EmmettBrown, what emulator?
<otakon> Meanwhile: don't diss the Mario.
<EmmettBrown> Dolphin
<sprinkle_GS17> otakon: lol you said vibro...
<Meanwhile> otakon: Mario sucks.
<Bronysith> what is it kirzstryfe ?
<GabeMoist> Saturn, I'd speak Anglo-Saxon
<Vordox> Gypsy Bard!
<Bronysith> ..
<Bronysith> nvm
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: it's not a symptom of the world we live in, it's just a fact of how language works
<derpy_pony> this day aria!
<otakon> sprinkle_GS17: no, I said VI BRO
<prince-dari> Saturn: Yes, and using who in place of whom is still wrong
<Saturn> 08,01it's the chinese whispers principle
<Bronysith> VioletVanilla: winter wrap up
<sprinkle_GS17> otakon: :3
<Bronysith> VioletVanilla: winter wrap up
<otakon> PINKIE'S BREW!
<Vordox> derpy_pony: You KNOW how high notes those are O.o
<otakon> DO YOU HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL VI BRO!?
<derpy_pony> erm... yes ^^
<Meanwhile> Hehe, vi bro...
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i may be wrong on this, but i think you might be disagreeing with the dictionary now
<EmmettBrown> <CrimsonPhoenix> Dolphin
<prince-dari> Depends on the dictionary I'm sure
<otakon> Pinkie's Brew!
<prince-dari> You can't have "I could care less" in place of "I couldn't care less" though.
<otakon> PLEASE!
<Saturn> 08,01i'd have to look it up, but i'm pretty sure that the cambridge style guide now indicated that "who" can be used instead of "whom"
<sprinkle_GS17> the dictionary is wrong then, obviously
<EmmettBrown> I USE DOLPHIN EMULATOR
<CrimsonPhoenix> EmmettBrown, it's four star on compatibility
<Dalekkahn> Stop startin.
<Bronysith> Dalekkahn: slag
<otakon> reminds me of Doc Brown
<kirzstryfe> 8,6why hasn't the sea pony song been sung yet?
<CrimsonPhoenix> either your computer isn't strong or you got the settings wrong
<hen3ry> language evolves.
<prince-dari> A, because a mjority uses the correct version of the phrase, so the incorrect version is in the minority and therefore wrong on that count.
<GabeMoist> SHOO BE DOO
<CK|Catnap> mfw argument over the use of a word.
<otakon> kirzstryfe: for the end
<prince-dari> B, because they mean two different things.
<Meanwhile> Needs more Smooze.
<Bronysith> I HEAR IT
<killerpony7733> kirzstryfe: I'm very much wondering that
<Barbetos> Southern accent. lol
<GabeMoist> This reminds me of Bronystate Mods Sing
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, it's an unofficially accepted form of the phrase now, and there's nothing you can really do about it but deal with it
<Flyboy> YEAAH!
<Lil_B> kirzstryfe his final Troll movie will be just that
<Flyboy> MAY FAV!
<prince-dari> It's not accepted at all.
<Chrysalis> ViBroth sing SeaPonies!!!!!!
<Flyboy> MY*
<Bronysith> VioletVanilla: ty very much
<GabeMoist> Broth?
<prince-dari> It's still the minority.
<derpy_pony> mic delay
<alexxm> can we just get over whatever this arguements about
<hen3ry> BGM is louder than Vibro.
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo!
<prince-dari> Until it either equals correct use or exceeds it, it'll still be wrong.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01E-bay are being dicks. They're spamming me through my mail that I need for updates when I buy or sell things, so I can't send that address to spam.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6song track is overpowering the mic :(
<Vordox> That's the thing, the stream sends the first audio, then digitalize his voice, then send it, causing a delay of 0.01-0.2 sec =P
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, i agree with you that it's wrong in a semantic sense; it completely changes the meaning of the phrase. i'm never goign to use it as a phrase myself, but i wouldn't say that it detracts from the rest of the song.
<alexxm> i can hardly hear the guy
<Saturn> 08,01at least, not in any significant way
<Saturn> 08,01also, it's called artistic licence
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: That's how they getcha.
<Saturn> 08,01which i probablt just spelled wrong
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<hen3ry> She's evil. She's allowed to break the laws of grammar, considering all the other law she's trying to break.
<Meanwhile> This debate has gone on long enough.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, "couldn't" won't fit in the line
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They didn't start spamming me until I sold my Saw stuff on e-bay.
<Saturn> 08,01or, at least, would jar
<Vordox> There's one thing to fix this, using the audio of the stereo to intake the mic causing a natural sync of digitalizing the sound. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now they won't shut-up.
<derpy_pony> Nittany_Discord: they are using different subject lines. you can filter the spam out by using them.
<Devonx25> hi everypony!.
<Vordox> But meh, it's not complicated but takes a few minutes
<prince-dari> I can understand that, but for me this is that situation of "One person won't make any difference"
<Devonx25> what is goin on?.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5045/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In g-mail?
<alexxm> hey Devonx25
<Vordox> He's doing a good voice at the AJ part. <.<
<Saturn> 08,01oh hey, it's Nittany_Discord!
<derpy_pony> use a local mail program
*Saturn 08,01hugs best weatherpony
<Devonx25> -_-. i could sing better than that!.
<prince-dari> If I just accept it without complaint, I'll be contributing to these utterly wrong uses of the language.
<Devonx25> lol.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: my baldness blinds you
<kirzstryfe> 8,6wha't do that arguingment is all of him t,alking of...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Saturn!
<Devonx25> not lag behind too.
<prince-dari> If we all just let it slide, it'll eventually become accepted.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs the planet
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, you can find a middle ground, that's what i do. i still acknowledge it's wrong, but it doesn't ruin the song for me.
*Bronysith noms on the planet
<Devonx25> i could sing along better and not lag behind.
<Meanwhile> kirz: You accidently the sentence.
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn did you send that email and if so, where to because i can't seem to find it...
<Devonx25> fail.
<prince-dari> Fair enough Saturn
<Meanwhile> Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<prince-dari> Though I'm sure you'll also accept that that line does ruin the song for me
<Flyboy> NOOOOOO!!!
<otakon> awesome
<Bronysith> YES
<Devonx25> wtf....
<Flyboy> GOD NO!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<Flyboy> KILL ME!
<Meanwhile> Someone find him a lyric sheet
<prince-dari> Which is the reason this argument started, otakon wouldn't accept that I hated the song just for that line.
<otakon> OH GOD
<Devonx25> :O.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/Push-it-somewhere-else-Patrick/
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's bacon and applejack
<Flyboy> I HAve Lost All Reputation For You
<Devonx25> y there no video?.
<otakon> prince-dari: it's not good reasoning to hate a WHOLE song for ONE line.
<Vordox> Oh god Sea ponies song XD
<derpy_pony> rainbow dash always dresses in style
<Devonx25> fail.
<Meanwhile> Flyboy: I think you meant "respect"
<otakon> :P
<Devonx25> bye, everypony!.
<CrimsonPhoenix> my hormones are confused
<otakon> bye Dev...gone
<Flyboy> Meanwhile: yeah thanks :)
<prince-dari> otakon: It's good enough for me. Just as terrible spelling and grammar would ruin any story for me.
<Ponies47> Later Dev....:(
<Meanwhile> I love sea ponies. Even if they are harbingers of Cthulhu
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: guy with wide range
<Lil_B> Whos singing now? is that Vivi?

<Meanwhile> Yes please.
<CrimsonPhoenix> your voice sounds perfect for it
<Flyboy> i'm only joking of course. i would never lose respect for you my freind, as you are AMAZING
<otakon> Yes.
<prince-dari> CK|Catnap: That's kind of different in that it's not meant to be a good story in the first place, so it can't be ruined.
<prince-dari> :P
<Flyboy> tME!
<Meanwhile> I do

<prince-dari> otakon: That's using dialect for an affect
<CK|Catnap> Dari: Nonsense, Spiderses is an amazing story. D:
<hen3ry> your background music is too loud for your mic, Vi-bro.
<derpy_pony> do it without bgm pls...the microphone delay lets you lag behind
<otakon> prince-dari: but dialect is not wrong despite it CLEARLY spitting in the face of the GRANITE COLUMNS OF THE RULE OF LANGUAGE!
<Meanwhile> otakon: Get over it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey dude, can you please sing Always by Erasure?
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ollrs/
<otakon> Meanwhile: I'm over it, it's just goddamn nitpicky so I keep bringing it up that it IS nitpicky.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Well stop it.
<sprinkle_GS17> prince-dari: so people whos native language isnt english and their english is imperfect can never make a story youd like?
<otakon> Meanwhile: you stop being British then.
<Meanwhile> otakon: K, I'll start being Hungarian.

<otakon> Meanwhile: there you go, done.
