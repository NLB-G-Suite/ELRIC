<mib_jolsjb> internet is srs buziness
<YusukeKomiya> hey you ever read Densha Otaku it works
<Polarfire> opinions everywhere matter.
<FreezeFrame> No more or less than those of random people you meet offlines, RainbowDoubleDash
<books> I like the mods
<Denied_Existence> Sure, sounds hilarious/enlightening
<Polarfire> ^
<mib_jolsjb> Is it pony?
<mib_jolsjb> Yes.
<Dee_Twenty> Everypony is entitled to have an opinion... but only mine is correct.
<YusukeKomiya> hmmmmm that sounds pretty good
<mib_jolsjb> Then YES
<Pinkamina> I'd like that :P
<Gecomol> MOds are the coolest
<TTG> 0Well either opinions matter or they don't
<SirSprinkles> 6And yes, Circuit Mane, I am Pyro
<RandomExtra> Sounds like it'd be good.
<TTG> 0It depends on the subject, not the source
<RainbowDoubleDash> *Insert Neutral Response Here*
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<books> I like the mods. They keep me unbanned and stuff and I am gratful.
<CircuitMane> I would never doubt it
<TTG> 0Wait, the hell? @ Rainbow "oohoohooh"

<Glacymr> 12hi

<eXAKR> Ohai
<eXAKR> I was wondering where to find the HGSS soundtrack
<Gecomol> it's the thought that counts
<YusukeKomiya> does any1 else here think someday we need a kung fu movie here
<RandomExtra> Possibly.
<TTG> 0Kung Pow *trollface*
<TTG> 0WeeeOOHweeOOOWeeeOOOWeeOOO
<Denied_Existence> ....
<Gecomol> Is tentacolino a good kun-fu movie?
<YusukeKomiya> XP my name is Betty
<sotha> Is this really what's playing. Could I ever expect any less?
<CircuitMane> @Denied_Existence Definitely do
<TTG> 0Isn't Betty a girls name?
<RainbowDoubleDash> Rush Hour

<Ziltoid> OH GOD DOUBLE
<TTG> 0Nested sexy saxman
<TGPFluttershy> Alright, I have got stuff to do tomorrow and I need my sleep. I'd like to thank those who selected the movies and the episodes. WWU and Army of Darkness NEVER get old. Across the universe and Sonic Rainboom are also fun. Have a great weekend everypony!
<YusukeKomiya> Ip Man is pretty boss
<sotha> I liked it double.
<Denied_Existence> CircuitMane , think I could join up this monday?
<TGPFluttershy> Oh yeah, one last thing
<mib_jolsjb> Might as well say it now.

<TTG> 0There's something about this song
<mib_jolsjb> lawl
<mib_jolsjb> double stream
<Denied_Existence> Its kinda soothing
<CircuitMane> Denied_Existence: Well I have a few already lined up but I can see about getting you in. Have a skype?
<Nittany_Tiger> I assume stream requests are over since Epic Sax Spike is playing.
<YusukeKomiya> would you make love to this song?
<Gecomol> never get tired of this..... maybe
<TTG> 0It's like, it turns me on a little but it just keeps looping so I feel kind blue-balled
<mib_r7473f> it's mind numbing after a while
<TTG> 0*kinda
<mib_jolsjb> HEY Mod
<TGPFluttershy> I'm doing a DJ-Pon-3 cosplay for BroNYcon. Started a thread about it too. If you could be so kind and please comment on it or just keep bucking it it would be awesome! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35725602.html#i35725602
<Denied_Existence> @CircuitMane yep, same key, underbar and all

<TGPFluttershy> Enjoy your weekend! :-)

<TTG> 0Night

<Denied_Existence> CircuitMane, I could pull it up right now if you want to test the connection
<mib_jolsjb> Celestia is such a troll..
<Glacymr> 12;-;
<TTG> 0How much longer is this video 0o
<Bashfluff> I just found this line in a fic
<mib_jolsjb> Lunar Republic ftw.
<Bashfluff> I can't sstop laughing
<Bashfluff> despite being kind of a twat, Angel was very perceptive
<RainbowDoubleDash> 90s flashy leather jacket if within budget
<mib_jolsjb> What fic?
<Bashfluff> Some shipfic on FF.net
*mib_jolsjb test
<Bashfluff> It's called the pit for a reason.
<TTG> 0I hate when fics make angel an asshole
<Bashfluff> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053844/6/The_Desire_of_the_Loneliest_Heritage
<Bashfluff> They didn't, but THAT LINE.
<eXAKR> K thanks Roara
<YusukeKomiya> Fly me to the moon plz
<TTG> 0lol
<Bashfluff> This story is supposed to be serious.
<TTG> 0The hell, lol
<Bashfluff> That makes it 100x worse.
<RainbowDoubleDash> fanon and serious don't go well together
*mib_jolsjb Can you write in a text document "Good Night Everypony!" and put it on the top half of spike??!
<TTG> 0Kind of like Campfire Secrets
<eXAKR> I got a MegaUpload link, but MegaUpload is schizo with mr

<books> I'm judging the story, not you
<books> btw
<mib_jolsjb> I read all fanfiction including clop. Although the aforementioned is actually usually hilarious.
<TTG> 0Yeah, other than that odd line, it's a great fic
<RainbowDoubleDash> Is there a fanfic where AJ deals with her Alcoholism?
<TTG> 0lol
<mib_jolsjb> Uhh
<mib_jolsjb> There is an fic where ... Twilight Rare and AJ get drunk of Apple cider/wine
<books> There's some abridged stuff?
<mib_jolsjb> A sleepover at there place
<TTG> 0Scrumpty Apple something
<Bashfluff> Campfire Secrets was epic.
<Bashfluff> The sequel, not so much.

<books> I have one rule about sleep:
<TTG> 0SWAG
<YusukeKomiya> You know what i find very awkward, fanfics where ponies curse and talk about sex
<YusukeKomiya> well if its among the mane 6
<books> after 6, fuck it, and stay up all the next day
<Bashfluff> I don't think so.
<Bashfluff> Not if you do it right.
<drf|laptop> 03stupid phone ads
<RainbowDoubleDash> I love the night so much more than the day... so much more peaceful
<mib_jolsjb> Not for me books, if I can get 2-4 hours it makes a HUGE difference
<mib_jolsjb> I'm addicted to the night now
<mib_jolsjb> I say fuck the day
<drf|laptop> 03"Only AT&T lets your iPhone talk and surf the web at the same time" <- I can do that with my Droid, moral of the story is DON'T BUY A CRAPPY IPHONE
<books> Coffee makes a huge difference.
<mib_jolsjb> I don't use caffine
<mib_jolsjb> I use Luna
<books> I inject it into my veins
<TTG> 0It's all down to execution @ sex and swearing in ponyfic
<RainbowDoubleDash> Caffeine is one hell of a drug
<books> caffine, not ponies.
<Aurora> ^
<books> I wish I could inject ponies.
<mib_jolsjb> =D
<YusukeKomiya> well if its about OC ponies i dun mind but i can't really imagine the mane 6
<mib_jolsjb> inb4 news calls ponies a drug
<drf|laptop> 03AT&T ads make me want to kill someone
<YusukeKomiya> well mayb AJ
<mib_jolsjb> Rarity + Twilight
<RainbowDoubleDash> fox news maybe
<drf|laptop> 03though LOL @ these ads, which I just will say are nsfw
<mib_jolsjb> RD + everything
<Bashfluff> Holy hell1
<drf|laptop> 03and this is on the History chanenl
<YusukeKomiya> fox news is hilarious
<TTG> 0A few pairings work better than others
<books> Appledash.
<TTG> 0DashiePie works well, imo
<RainbowDoubleDash> its so entertaining... in some countries... it's even illegal!
<Bashfluff> I just read the comments on Campfire on EQD, and Butterscotch offered to edit it and the sequel.
<Bashfluff> HE NEVER RESPONDED.
<mib_jolsjb> Ok is the mod still here?
<mib_jolsjb> Or is this on auto loop?
<Bashfluff> I like the idea of SpikexPP, personally.
<YusukeKomiya> Any1 read the Story where the Mane 6 go to alt universe wit gender switched versions
<books> Pinkie pie doesn't work well with anypony, I tihnk.
<eXAKR> Indeed
<books> too asexual, non-human of a pony
*Glacymr puts kyu on his head
<Kyu> 07.-.
<TTG> 0Yeah, Cross and Arrow is great
<Bashfluff> I don't think so at all.
<mib_jolsjb> I 100% don't trust fox news
<books> I can't see her caring about any kind of relationship
<mib_jolsjb> Anything on that is retarded.
<TTG> 0I agree most of the time
<TTG> 0but some people make it work
<SilverSonic> <eXAKR> I was wondering where to find the HGSS soundtrack <-- I have a HGSS Soundtrack thats about 866MB XD
<FreezeFrame> Cross and an Arrow is promising, at this point.
<YusukeKomiya> Cross and Arrow is pretty weird, wat would it b like if you liked your rule 63 self
<Bashfluff> Except for that she goes insane without her friends, and that she's good at being serious when it comes to them.
<mib_jolsjb> Ok folks
<books> I'll believe it when I see it
<Bashfluff> Especially secret-keeping.
<FreezeFrame> Not going to say it's "good" until it gets a bit further in.
<mib_jolsjb> The Empy Room
<mib_jolsjb> Or whatever
<mib_jolsjb> You read it?
<Djemba> SAX :3
<junh1024-XD> mine's 1.29 GB
<RainbowDoubleDash> If you break up with pinkie pie... let's just say I hope you lived a full life
<TTG> What
<SilverSonic> inb4 because its lossless
<books> Cupcakes will still be my favorite fanfic
<SilverSonic> XD
<junh1024-XD> yup
<Bashfluff> Her relationships are some of the few things she is serious about.
<Djemba> I take it we're in the Intermission?
<Polarfire> ...
<TTG> Oh, sheeit
<Polarfire> nope. post stream
<YusukeKomiya> the Derpy and Dinky ones make me teary eye
<mib_jolsjb> [SPOLIERS] The Empty Room or something, it's basically Celestia finds a hidden room of her daughter.
<Djemba> Oh...it's all over?
<Bashfluff> Also, ton of good ideas in this thread.
<Bashfluff> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35700328.html
<SilverSonic> SAM Broadcaster unfortunately can't play FLACs
<drf|laptop> 03you don't use Winamp?
<Polarfire> yup. streams start at 7 EST on fridays.
<TTG> ;_; @ Dinky
<Djemba> Ah.
<SilverSonic> I don't anymore
<junh1024-XD> you can doubble the size to WAV
<Djemba> When did the movies end?
<TTG> Amybody read Silent Ponyville?
<YusukeKomiya> like when they tried to take Dinky away cause they thought Derpy was too stupid 2 take care of a filly
<junh1024-XD> can SAMB play WAV?
<mib_jolsjb> I read Silent Ponyville
<SilverSonic> yup
<SirSprinkles> 6WTF LOOP STOPPED
<mib_jolsjb> I liked it
<drf|laptop> 03what is SAM Broadcaster then
<mib_jolsjb> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-empty-room.html
<drf|laptop> 03is it its own media player?
<Bashfluff> That's actually the third story down on my list.
<mib_jolsjb> That story
<TTG> Yeah, it was pretty well done
<Glacymr> 12?
<books> IT'S OVER
<books> MY GOD
<Bashfluff> I still need to finish FO: E first.
<TTG> I've been meaning to read TER
<books> ಠ_ಠ
<mib_jolsjb> I thought it was cool, but it wasn't spectacular.
<SilverSonic> SAM Broadcaster is what i use to DJ for my Radio Nintendo show
<Bashfluff> Then start Dangerous Business.
<SilverSonic> the software looks complex but its easy to use
<mib_jolsjb> I'm so fucking Depressed at The Empty Room..
<Bashfluff> THEN I can read Silent Ponyville.
<TTG> Oh, god, Dangerous Business
<SilverSonic> also it wasnt free, but *cough*torrentedit*cough*
<YusukeKomiya> i like the one story where Twilight uses a spell that works like the Animus
<TTG> so guuuuud
<drf|laptop> 03but why do you need it instead of using winamp?
<Bashfluff> Apparently it's good.
<Denied_Existence> We are at 40 and wearing down
<mib_jolsjb> I read all the way to chapter 11 or so of TER.
<Bashfluff> But I dunno.
<drf|laptop> 03also I misread it as "torrent edit"
<books> how many chapters of past sins are there?
<Bashfluff> I REALLY liked only a few fics.
<mib_jolsjb> Then the author... Gosh..
<mib_jolsjb> 13?
<TTG> 13
<mib_jolsjb> atm
<TTG> so far
<SilverSonic> its designed for Radio Shows, plus Winamp may be easy but its not what most of the DJs on RN are using now, so i switched to SAM
<Djemba> What, I can't change nicks in here?
<mib_jolsjb> August = UPDATES
<TTG> the author posts in clumps
<books> Okay, seems doable.
<mib_jolsjb> 3 at a time
<Denied_Existence> Any other jazz tapes?
<YusukeKomiya> for wat fic?
<Bashfluff> FO: E, Past Sins, that ALan Wake crossover...
<mib_jolsjb> Creeping Darkness Bash
<Bashfluff> Twelve was freaking amazing.
<Denied_Existence> I am trying to decide what this reminds me of
<FreezeFrame> Djemba: People were spamming it.
<Djemba> Oh
<drf|laptop> 03why do you need something fancy though
<drf|laptop> 03if I did DJ'ing I'd just use winamp XD
<Djemba> I don't do that sort of thing :S
<Denied_Existence> Hmmm....who is that guy who does the art show and paints 'happy clouds'?
<TTG> Bob Ross
<Denied_Existence> Thats it
<YusukeKomiya> you know who was awsome, Mr. Rogers
<mib_jolsjb> I'm addicted to watching this video. The Luna dance in the bottom right... gosh..
<FreezeFrame> White dude with huge red 'fro, was parodied (quite amusingly) on Boondocks
<TTG> Hell yeah
<TTG> I
<TTG> I'd be his neighbor
<TTG> wait
<Denied_Existence> LUNA DANCE IS MESMERIZING
<TTG> that sounds
<RainbowDoubleDash> Mr. Rogers was an awesome man
<TTG> he's cool is all
<SilverSonic> also with SAM, You can stream to no server, so when i have to stream in a low quality, i can use a 2nd encoder to broadcast to no server at a high quality and save that stream to file. Winamp unfortunately can't do that
<FreezeFrame> And yes, Mr. Rogers was a genuinely good man.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Bashfluff> Until Kira killed him.
<SilverSonic> also with winamp you need SAM Encoders (What i used) and it crashes.
<YusukeKomiya> Dam u Kira
<YusukeKomiya> u noe the way Kira died was pretty lame
<SilverSonic> it crashes when i try to close winamp or go into the menu settings
<TTG> Musta missed that episode of DN
<drf|laptop> 03just set your recording device to WAV Out, or Stereo Mix, then you can play with Winamp, and pipe it through that :P
<RainbowDoubleDash> well even gods die
<Denied_Existence> Spike can play Saxaphone with one hand...WHAT CAN YOU DO!?
<books> kira is not a person
<Bashfluff> Depends on which version of the show you saw.
<books> kira is a concept
<Bashfluff> Manga or anime.
<YusukeKomiya> well i mean raito
<books> other people were "kira" for awhile
<SilverSonic> ;p
<YusukeKomiya> lol engrish
<TTG> Evey took over for him to rebuild =D
<books> Yagami was a person
<Bashfluff> Kira is what everyone calls the murderer.
<Bashfluff> It's his name, to them.
<books> Kira is a god.
<Denied_Existence> The voices are telling me scary things...
<Bashfluff> They are looking for Kira.
<mib_jolsjb> I've got such a headache.
<Starflower> : O
<Bashfluff> That means a person.
<Aurora> WOOOOOOOOT
<Bashfluff> Kira coming from the word killer.
<mib_jolsjb> I woke up Thursday with such a bad hangover...
<books> They thought of him as a person,
<Aurora> I GOT MY CLASSES
<SilverSonic> awesome
<Bashfluff> It's a name/title.
<drf|laptop> 03told you you would :P
<books> because they thought thwere was just one person
<Denied_Existence> Your looking too deep into this Bash
<FreezeFrame> "Go ahead, shoot! You are only killing a man!"
<books> but Kira is anyone who kills int he name of kira
<books> usually with a death note
<Bashfluff> No.
<YusukeKomiya> you now wats a good anime, Gurren Lagann
<mib_jolsjb> So what what now?
<Denied_Existence> ?
<mib_jolsjb> Anime?
<Denied_Existence> I AM CONFUZZLED
<SilverSonic> btw Aurora, those links to the soundtracks, the tags are all in japanese x___x
<books> Confluttershy
<TTG> I liked what I saw of TTGL
<Denied_Existence> WHY YOU NO LOGIC!?
<Bashfluff> They say there's another person who kills like him, so they called him, or in this case her, the second kira.
<Bashfluff> The second killer.
<TTG> I got to about just after... uh... his death
<Aurora> lol
<Denied_Existence> But who was Fone!?
<TTG> and haven't picked it back up uet
<TTG> *yet
<Aurora> I found out why they were filled up so fast
<Aurora> basically
<Aurora> people have this option to add them to the worksheet
<YusukeKomiya> The show went downhill for me after a certain some1 went away
<books> Kira is not always spoken of as a person, It's not a tital for a person
<Aurora> but you can't actually ADD them until they day
<mib_jolsjb> Oh hey
<books> people look for Kira, but that doesn't mean they're looking for a person
<Aurora> but by adding them to your worksheet, it apparently still counts as a seat
<Aurora> since you're putting one on hold
<mib_jolsjb> Anyone got the THundercats Premeire for DL?
<Aurora> but as people finish their worksheets
<Denied_Existence> WHAT A TWIST
<YusukeKomiya> wish, heard it was good
<Aurora> they drop the courses they dont need
<TTG> Can we quit with the bullshit Death Note philosophising? XD
<YusukeKomiya> Flootershai
<Aurora> and now I'm actually having trouble because I get to DECIDE which classes i want
<Bashfluff> Yeah they are.
<Denied_Existence> NOTES OF DEATH
<Starflower> ZE MAGICKS
<SilverSonic> lmao
<YusukeKomiya> lets talk about Metal Gear Solid 2
<Denied_Existence> ARE SUPRISINGLY TASTY
<Bashfluff> They are clearly looking for the person.
<YusukeKomiya> thats some trippy stuff there
<junh1024-XD> ftp://pkmnmusic:pkmnmusic@fma1394.hoshinet.org/OST/Japanese/2009/74%20NDS%20Pokemon%20Heartgold%20Soulsilver%20Music%20Super%20Complete%20[FLAC]/
<Aurora> but I got two required art classes
<Bashfluff> Watch the ending confrontation in episode 2 again.
<junh1024-XD> these FLACs' tags should be in english
<Aurora> and three GE classes
<Aurora> not just electives :'D
<Bashfluff> L isn't looking for a God.
<junh1024-XD> or atleast, the filenames are
<Bashfluff> He doesn't even believe they exist.
<Denied_Existence> TWIST ENDING
<Starflower> The sax is eating into my brain
<Bashfluff> He wants to catch the murderer, and in his eyes, it's a person.
<drf|laptop> 03ugh, stupid Weed drink, naming alcohol after illegal drugs is like the worst of both worlds >_P>
<drf|laptop> 03-P
<books> at that time, kira was thought og by L as a single person comitting murder
<mib_jolsjb> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6571625 Anypony wants to see Thundercats 2011
<TTG> Are you arguing with yourself or what?
<TTG> Is anyone else talking about this? XD
<Bashfluff> It's an alias.
<books> Talking about what?
<Denied_Existence> Luna...dance...stealing...brain...
<TTG> Death Note
<Denied_Existence> gah....
<books> I am.
<Starflower> Epic...sax...stealing...brain
<YusukeKomiya> any1 watched Big O
<Bashfluff> Light Yagami (夜神 月 Yagami Raito?), also known as Kira
<Bashfluff> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Yagami
<FreezeFrame> In a way, it makes sense that all the murders do fall on Light Yagami. After all, Charles Manson was held responsible directly for all the murders committed by his Family.
<RainbowDoubleDash> If Twilight Sparkle found the deathnote... lets just call it the "BanishBook" Do you think she would use it?
<TTG> square square square
<Denied_Existence> TO THE MOON WITH YOU
<Bashfluff> I don't think so.
<Bashfluff> She seems very afraid of Celestia banishing ponies.
<Bashfluff> She knows the power.
<TTG> THE PONY WHO'S NAME IS WRITTEN IN THIS NOTEBOOK SHALL D- er, uh, BE SENT TO THE SHADOW REALM
<Bashfluff> Plus, there seems to be too little crime for her to use it much.
<YusukeKomiya> lol shadow realm
<books> I made my point and I see I cannot convince you otherwise. I will say that I see "Kira" as a concept and not a person but you seem to accept otherwise
<books> Let us all carry on.
<Lugianite-afk> I am back
<FreezeFrame> okay, I need to sleep
<YusukeKomiya> so does any1 really believe the U.S. is failing
<TTG> I'd say Kira is a bad example of this symbol thing, because Kira died
<Denied_Existence> Kira is neither a concept, nor person....IT IS A STATE OF BEING. This is being said by somebody who has never seen deathnote
<YusukeKomiya> and that the E.U. and Asia will repalce it
<Manlyguy> Yo.
<TTG> Maybe V from V for Vendetta would be a better example
<books> I accept Kira as a god, so, yeah.
<RainbowDoubleDash> well they NEED to increase the debt limit first of all
<Bashfluff> We can both agree that the Light/Ryuk fics should never exist.
<books> they should
<books> !
<YusukeKomiya> true to that Bash
<Denied_Existence> See? Even a clueless person can be smart sometimes
<books> :D
<books> I would love Kira to exist
<TTG> aw, shit, man, really?
<YusukeKomiya> dude that would b horrible
<Bashfluff> Not what I'm saying.
<Denied_Existence> ...That sounds like a bad idea
<mib_jolsjb> USA Debt. Ha
<mib_jolsjb> What a joke
<Bashfluff> I'm talking about a horrible slashfic pairing.
<Bashfluff> >.<
<RainbowDoubleDash> Kira CAN exist... just get rid of organized religion
<YusukeKomiya> hey lets not bring that in here
<books> huh?
<Lugianite> hm
<Denied_Existence> So...like the USSR?
<Bashfluff> Kira would become a religion.
<Denied_Existence> Or somesuch
<Lugianite> we has a drf
<books> I'd rather not talk about religoen here
<Bashfluff> Just like in the show.
<drf|laptop> 03yes we do
<books> if all palaces.
<YusukeKomiya> ya touchy subject man
<Denied_Existence> Ok...thats it, I must see this movie
<Bashfluff> Spirituality is fine.
<TTG> Yeah, forcing it's no better that itself
<YusukeKomiya> watever floats ones boat just dun force it on me
<Bashfluff> At the point you try to fuck with people's lives because of it, you and I will have problems.
<RainbowDoubleDash> w/e just forget about it
<Bashfluff> Like the Catholic church calling conspiracy when the media called them out on their kid fucking.
<books> dude.
<Denied_Existence> Religion works like this: We know that the energy in our brains dissipates to some other place when we die. Where that is, is entirely up to you.
<TTG> I'd prefer rational thought to spiritiality or whatever, but that's me and only me
<Bashfluff> Did you guys see that story a while back about the pope's visit to Malta?
<Denied_Existence> Therefore, we make our own religion by our beliefs
<TTG> We know what now?
<Lugianite> hows it been going man?
<drf|laptop> 03alright
<Bashfluff> Anonymous replaced pictures advertising the Pope's visit to Malta with Pedobear.
<TTG> lol
<YusukeKomiya> XP
<RainbowDoubleDash> Anon you so classy
<Denied_Existence> Sorry, scientist in the room with the religious discussion makes nobody happy
<Bashfluff> Like, the posters were the same except for it was pedobear instead of the pope.
<mib_jolsjb> Oh hai guyz I'm atheist

<mib_jolsjb> We do what we must because we can.
<eXAKR> I think I want to start converting my higher bitrate MP3s into FLACs
<YusukeKomiya> they probably screwed up the world more than any1
<books> ಠ_ಠ
<mib_jolsjb> For the good of all of us

<Denied_Existence> SERIOUS SHIT
<TTG> I BLAME CROMAGNON MAN
<drf|laptop> 03converting mp3 into FLAC completely defeats the purpose of FLAC.

<RainbowDoubleDash> ponies are serious shit
<Denied_Existence> ^
<TTG> IF THEY HADN'T SURVIVED, NONE OF US WOULD BE IN THIS MESS
<books> but there's no sense crying over every mistake.
<Nittany_Tiger> Nothing wrong with talking about serious business.
<Glacymr> 12MIDIs make good FLACs though
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a fairly open channel.
<drf|laptop> 03true
<YusukeKomiya> i personally hate how Japan has really westernized

<TTG> Sonic Heroes, brah
<Denied_Existence> NOOOOOOOOOO...ok..goodnight

<Glacymr> 12it's not too hard to take my time and add one hour :P
<TTG> Oh
<books> 0Not okay.
<books> 0D:
<VioletVanilla> I'm just kidding with you. . . ;A;
<books> 0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdJT_KY5_s&feature=related
<books> 0I figured.
<VioletVanilla> I'm debating. . .
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0It's all but confirmed Luna is going to be in a season 2 episode, but I can't fathom how she would act
<books> 0debating what?
<books> 0she may very well never be spoken of again
<TTG> Gah, I dislike Pinkie Keen so much
<VioletVanilla> I recorded myself trying to sound like Fluttershy. . . but I don't think I should upload it. . x.x
<books> 0but yeah, I'm no script writer.
<VioletVanilla> The episode Pinkie Ken?
<VioletVanilla> Keen*
<TTG> Yeah
<VioletVanilla> Mmmm. . .
<books> 0The ending, I understand
<VioletVanilla> Me neither. .
<VioletVanilla> It was kind of. . .
<books> 0Lauren Fasut apoloized for it
<TTG> Well, Twilight was kind a douche throughout
<books> 0the wrote a whole blog thing about it
<books> 0so it's okay.
<TTG> I have a pet theory that helps explain the episode, in a way that helps me feel better about it
<books> 0http://www.mylittleponynews.com/2011/02/feeling-pinky-keen-controversy.html
<TTG> The episode's moral isn't about blind belief in something
<TTG> It
<TTG> is about the willing suspension of disbelief
<books> 0Yeah, the moral could easily have been changed to something better and still in-context.
<TTG> Pinkie isn't some unexplained pheonomenon
<VioletVanilla> "Some interpret the moral, and the episode, as implying that it's bad to search for explanations for things one doesn't understand."
<TTG> She's a cartoon character
<VioletVanilla> ^ This person. Is an idiot.
<VioletVanilla> Not you TTG >~<
<books> 0?!
*books 0I'm the only other one posting
<VioletVanilla> No no~
<TTG> Twilight Sparkle is a rational mind trapped in a cartoon
<VioletVanilla> THe quote I put dow
<VioletVanilla> down*
<books> 0oohhh
<books> 0okay.
<TTG> And Pinkie does things that defy explanation
<drfsupercenter> 03woah, power spike
<drfsupercenter> 03my battery backup started beeping
<TTG> we take that without questioning because it's just a show
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0don't worry about that episode... just have faith that it was all for the best
<drfsupercenter> 03luckily the darned clocks didn't go out again >_>
<books> 0it's a god episode but the moral is poorly worded
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really odd though as it's not storming at all so wtf is going on with the power
<books> 0It's good to know that so many people still love the show even if it psudo bashes atheism
<books> 0which a lot of the fans probably are, at least on reddi
<books> 0t
<VioletVanilla> Which isn't necessarily bad. . . Because it wasn't shoving it down people's throates. . .
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0its a difficult morale... but sometimes you have to speak from the heart and take a stab at it
<TTG> So, in a meta sense, Twilight believing in the Pinkie Sense without questioning it makes sense because of the willing suspension of disbelief =D
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway off to bed, I'm about to pass out
<TTG> Yes, I
<VioletVanilla> And now, Nigel Thornberry
<VioletVanilla> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFB4JisVks

<VioletVanilla> High on PINKIE PIE! 8D
<books> 0[?]
<TTG> oh shit
<TTG> XD
<TTG> a plastic bAAAUAUAUAUGH
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0What do you think Pinkie did at that rock farm anyways?
<VioletVanilla> XD
<books> 0I tihnk it was an exaggeration.
<VioletVanilla> Do you ever feel, like a plastic BLARGHARGARGH?
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<books> 0she thought she had such a boring life, it was liek working on a rock farm
<VioletVanilla> And that's how Equestria was made!
<books> 0so that's how she told the story.
<books> 0exactly.
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<TTG> Makes 'em go, BAUAGH, BAUAGH, BAUAGH
<TTG> I saw a comic that gave a possible explaination for the rock farm
<TTG> There is old alchemic beliefs that gold grew within rocks
<TTG> And Equestria is pretty magical
<TTG> so, maybe that has something to do with it
<books> 0farming for rarer materials?
<books> 0That makes since, but sounds more interesting then Pinkie would make it.
<TTG> Growing rarer materials in rocks
<TTG> Eh, I'm sure it was abore
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0Pinkie: If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!
<TTG> most of it is still pushing rocks around
<books> 0I'll stick with my Theory .
<TTG> Yeah, I thought pinkie may have been exaggerating when I watched the episode though
<VioletVanilla> It's her character!
<TTG> Killing Joke line, and all
<TTG> Not to mention possible contradictions
<TTG> Grammy Pie, skating since she was an itty bitty twinkie pie
<TTG> etc
<books> 0indeed.
<TTG> Party of One suggests that she did indeed have a flat mane before the rainboom, though
<RainbowDoubleDash> 0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5BnG07C7H0
<TTG> And was lonely and sad etc
<VioletVanilla> T^T

<RainBroDash> scrubnub
<RainBroDash> shame on you :3
<prince-dari> It was 2L of perry, 1/2L vodka, about 1/4 of a bottle of lambrini
<prince-dari> But I'm always fine in the morning anyway.
<NightSeas> 12LOL I hate it when stuff like that happens
<SoiPony> nice
<prince-dari> I think I fell out of the tree and cut my stomach.
<RainBroDash> win.
<SoiPony> lol
<RainBroDash> wait
<RainBroDash> dari why are you drinking lambrini
<RainBroDash> dari dari dari where did it allll go wrong
<prince-dari> Because that's what the girls brought.
<SoiPony> >girls
<prince-dari> They always bring lambrini.
<RainBroDash> it should be -you- buying the lambrini for -them- so -they- don't remember what -you- did.
<prince-dari> I brought lots of perry.
<prince-dari> 2 2L bottles. :P
<prince-dari> YFW my parents bought those for me to take
<prince-dari> My mum bought 2 cases of perry while I was away too.
<prince-dari> Probably for my party.
<prince-dari> INB4 RainBro turns up then
<RainBroDash> YFW i can buy alcohol myself
<RainBroDash> also: I'm going to your house party
<RainBroDash> whether you realise or not
<SoiPony> as am I
<RainBroDash> wat
<SoiPony> already on the flight
<prince-dari> YFW you had to find people who would sell to people <18 before you were old enough.
<RainBroDash> YFW i didnt start drinking till a week before i was 18
<prince-dari> Someone sent me this image about a month ago.
<prince-dari> MFW British teenage life is actually more like the first one
<RainBroDash> ikr
<RainBroDash> our lives rock
<prince-dari> Also, how did I only just notice that the second image is the inbetweeners?
<RainBroDash> LOL
<RainBroDash> Omfg I feel ashamed
<lighty> Yawn
<lighty> Went rowing with sister
<lighty> Splashed her a couple of times xD
<prince-dari> RainBro: What did I miss with the stream?
<prince-dari> Also, I should really make the system to get the channel names automatic, and usable by other people
<RainBroDash> Dari: since no-one is here, it was pretty rubbish
<prince-dari> Huh?
<prince-dari> No, how was the stream yesterday, what did I miss?
<RainBroDash> a few people tried to enjoy the movie, 90% of people hated it even though they'd never seen it
<RainBroDash> and they practically ruined it
<prince-dari> I'm confused.
<RainBroDash> and we lost 1/4 of viewers when it started
<prince-dari> Oh.
<RainBroDash> (I mean the a movie)
<lighty> Bbl, gotta go on a trip
<lighty> We're staying in this harbour for a day longer, now going on a ferry >.>

<ReticentSmolder> cool! are we talking artist or construction though?
<Nittany_Tiger> Renovation.
<Nittany_Tiger> Just preparing empty apartments to be spray painted.
<ReticentSmolder> like renovating old paintings? sounds cool man
<ReticentSmolder> ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
<ReticentSmolder> so spraying walls with chemicals? not as glamorous but a jobs a job right?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<ReticentSmolder> I worked a temp job recently installing servers in schools, those bitches are HEAVY
<Nittany_Tiger> And I get to stay in PA /if/ they pay me before my landlord charges me a late fee.
<Maxaminus> ohai guise
<Ziltoid> oh hai mark
<ReticentSmolder> *urban_camping* a daily adventure
<SilverSonic> o.o
<ReticentSmolder> aaaaaaaaaaand inb4 I broke chat
<Nittany_Tiger> The only other sucky thing is that I'm so out of shape that I had hellacious back pain for most of the week.
*Silverscreen 11returns with epicness.
<Maxaminus> ohai Silverscreen
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11MMPR remake movie premise: Zordon and Rita are from rival alien races, the former which tries to protect the galexy while the other looks to destroy it planet by planet. Zordon manages to trap Rita in the moon, but becomes unable to live in normal atmosphere anymore, thus has to live in the Command Center on earth while being looked over by Alpha 5.
<Silverscreen> 11 1,000 years later, Rita escapes her prison thanks to Goldar, a descendant of Rita’s old faithful servant. Him along with Squatt, Baboo and Finster built Rita’s new command center on the moon, from where Rita starts to send a reign of evil onto the earth. Zordon, unable to battle Rita himself, calls upon 5 teenagers with fighting abilities to stop Rita.
<Silverscreen> 11The sequel would consist of the green ranger storyline, and the third part of the trilogy focuses on the character of Lord Zed.
<Silverscreen> 11wall o' text. :P
<DragonRage> Good morning/afternoon, everyone.

<Elky> hi dragon
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Afternoon, DragonRage
<Elky> no preshow today?
<SilverSonic> wb Arti
<GreatWhiteHope> what is going to be shown today?
<DragonRage> My internet went and died last night on account of reasons I'm not too sure of, so I missed most of Across the Universe. How was it?
<Maxaminus> Never liked the campiness of MMPR but if someone redid it in a classy way I'd watch it.
<Silverscreen> 11Evil Dead III: ARmy of Darkness.
<Elky> and Across The Universe
<Silverscreen> 11Across the Universe
*ReticentSmolder squee
<GreatWhiteHope> cool, don't think I've actually seen either of those
<Elky> I hope it'll be good, I was too tired last night
<Ziltoid> across the universe was bleh
<ReticentSmolder> bit of a warning, Across the Universe is weird, and may not make sense if you don't know much about American History during the 60's and 70's
<Silverscreen> 11The power ranger suits would be more like actual battle armor, which is comprised of microtechnology (not too diferent from the Iron Man suit) that works through the power coins. :D
<Elky> uh, okay...
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, across the Universe is weird.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Awesome, I love weird musicals.
<ReticentSmolder> don't worry, I'm gonna be here to provide trivia and backstory for those who might get confused
<Elky> okay, thanks
<Silverscreen> 11yes, listen to SMolder.
<ReticentSmolder> some new guy last night thought I was a mode :D
<ReticentSmolder> mod*

<Silverscreen> 11This chat gave me diabetes
<Pegacorn> dat plot
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Too much cute? When Fluttershy is involved, there's no such concept as "too much."
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Dk
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Don't worry, Silverscreen. Army of Darkness can cure it.
<ReticentSmolder> DIABEETUS http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/0b7ce217b669b4f99a21bc0ba00c4bda/34569%20-%20angel%20Drink%20fluttershy%20glass.png
<Elky> Army of Darkness was weird
<Nittany_Tiger> I think ponies are immune to diabetes.
<Silverscreen> 11No, Across the Universe was weird.
<Ziltoid> http://www.derpyhooves.com/albums/displayimage.php?pid=235&fullsize=1
<HaveTubaWillTravel> By the way, was it the theretrical or director's cut we watched last night?
<Nittany_Tiger> Also obesity.
<Elky> it had everything DS2 had, but it never felt like an actual bad movie
<Ziltoid> http://mibpaste.com/QRiEGf
<Ziltoid> im bad at pictures
<Elky> dem links
<ReticentSmolder> @Nittany_Tiger don't call her fat, she's already an anorexic model
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't call anyone fat.
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> "Also obesity" meant "Probably also immune to obesity."
<ReticentSmolder> did someone say DIABEETUS? let me treat that for you http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnenbgYB3K1ql5gvto1_500.jpg
<Sathi> 7nice one
<Ziltoid> hello
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Damn you, Smolder. I should sue Flutternurse for malpractice, because my diabeetus is now worse.
<Pegacorn> OH PLEASE GOD NO!DIABEETUS!HELP ME BLACK DYNAMITE!

<Nittany_Tiger> If someone had a diet equivalent to Pinkie Pie's, they would weigh 600 lbs and have a shriveled pancreas and have an average sugar level of 400.
<Elky> trying so hard to restrain myself from insulting Fluttershy over here
<Nittany_Tiger> And be dead tomorrow.
<Aurora> 6there they go again
<HaveTubaWillTravel> No, just in need of treatment for diabeetus.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's sad.
<Aurora> 6 30 seconds
<Elky> well, Pinkie also moves at incredible speed all the time, so it works out
<Ziltoid> im the only user here what
<Nittany_Tiger> Because sweets and apples should be a part of your balanced breakfast.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I wonder how long it'll be before parents completely miss the point and accuse Pinkie of being a bad role model >.>
<ReticentSmolder> Pinkie Pie will help you with that diet problem http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/203/0/e/pinkie_pie_nurse_by_pyruvate-d419t6w.jpg

<Damos> and shes gone
<lollurd> i m,ust flee sexily
<Elky> wait, is that a trope ghosties?
<RobotPinkie> It's not that the shotgun doesn't kill, it's that Evil Ash is almost immortal

<MrPoniator> But still
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 ash's epic fail
<Elky> implying anything in this movie is sexy

<InsertCupcake> im off now, is there any streams between now and friday?
<Pegacorn> Then suddenly,his hand is back off.
<Marmaduke> 0I dunno about you guys.
<RainBroDash> Why would you ever want to miss a moment of that film? :trololo:
<Ghosties> 4@Elky: Not that I'm aware of. In the second Evil Dead II film, Ash marked the grave of deadite Linda, his girlfriend, and she kept coming back from the grave in later parts of the film
<Apokalipse> You don't need to reload the shotgun... ever. How is it not amazing?
<Elky> ah, I didn't remember that

<RobotPinkie> right in the face.
<The_Si> It comes in volumes.
<Elky> yup
<Damos> and she's back
<Hipster_Brony> 8silly lollurd

<RainBroDash> 10so many shots O.o
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I know. Ted's usually the workhorse in the Evil Dead films
<MrPoniator> How does one fire a shotgun like that?
<Ghosties> 4Poor Ted
<Pegacorn> Ash......Housewares.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Rapid fire cheat activate!
<kir13> way to many bullets
<Ghosties> 4In fact, I think Ted was the main antagonist in "My Name Is Bruce"
<MrPoniator> Convienant trampolines!
<Hipster_Brony> 8COME AT ME BRO
<RobotPinkie> They do look somewhat similar, though, of course, what with being brothers
<Pegacorn> Swallow this.
<Aurora> 6GET THE AETHER MOD OF MINECRAFT SO YOU CAN TAME A GIANT DINOSAUR BIRD AND RIDE IT AROUND
<Pegacorn> Hail to the king,baby.
<Razyn> Hail to the king, baby.
<Ghosties> 4Duke's got nothing on Ash Williams
<MrPoniator> Duke Nukem must feel proud of this guy
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WTF Steam
<Flutterpeanut> 13Hail to the king, Baby.
<Razyn> I've got balls of steel.
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently Half-Life's data is being used by Counter-STrike
<drfsupercenter> 03how are those games at all related
<lollurd> 0awww yeaaaahhhhh
<RobotPinkie> Funfact, reporter on the street in the movie Maniac Cop (starring Bruce Campbell) is played by Sam Raimi. :3
<Pegacorn> Duke's hero is Ash.End of story.
<fehfryr> :D
<Nittany_Tiger_> And a hand of steel.
<fehfryr> happy ending
<Dusky> valve engine DRF
<Ray> 02^
<Dusky> all made by Valve, with the valve engine
<Maxaminus_1> dat soundtrack
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but don't all Steam games use the Source engine?
<Dusky> and later with source
<Pegacorn> I want a link to that song now.
<Dusky> valve is oulder
<EspyLacopa> Get the axe!
<Ghosties> 4Haha, nice. I actually haven't seen any other Bruce Campbell film outside of the Evil Dead films and "My Name Is Bruce." Though, I have seen his work in Burn Notice
<ingaesia> well that movie was... something
<Dusky> source is newer
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8soundtrack needs moar flute
<Ilko> watch bubba hotep
<DragonRage> That movie was AWESOME
<RobotPinkie> Haven't seen that. :(
<fehfryr> needs more cowbell
<Elky> movie needs moar barrels
<Ilko> he plays an elderly elvis who fights a monster with jfk
<DragonRage> We should rewind it and watch it again and again and again and again
<RobotPinkie> Saw My Name is Bruce though
<Elky> also, Deathstalker 2 is still better
<Aurora> 6GET THE AETHER MOD OF MINECRAFT SO YOU CAN TAME A GIANT DINOSAUR BIRD AND RIDE IT AROUND
<Aurora> 6there I said it
<Ghosties> 4Oh man, you should. "My Name Is Bruce" is an awesome homage and parody to the b movie machismo of Bruce and his characters like Ash
<WhiteTailed> 12LOLOLOL
<RobotPinkie> Also saw The Man with the Screaming Brain
<Aurora> 6and she was here
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, Arti, which server are you connecting to?
<MrPoniator> So that's it for today's BMN?
<RobotPinkie> directed by Bruce, I believe
<EspyLacopa> Just imagine if Bruce Campbell had been the main actor in Deathstalker 2.
<fehfryr> special dead is quite a strange movie
<Elky> this one has kind of bad pacing
<WhiteTailed> 12BOTH XD both kept pinging out on me, I reset my router and modem just now though
<fehfryr> retarded zombies
<drfsupercenter> 03odd
<Elky> the ds1 protagonist is kinda like ash
<RobotPinkie> What's Burn Notice?
<Ghosties> 4If Bruce Campbell had been Death Stalker, I guarandamntee that film would have been 20x better
<drfsupercenter> 03ocean was pinging a lot earlier but my server was stable as ever XD
<WhiteTailed> 12LOL
<Ghosties> 4Burn Notice is a spy show on USA
<Elky> ds2 plays up the comedy more
<Pegacorn> This movie is the best Bruce Cambell movie in my opinion.
<ReticentSmolder> @Ghosties 20% cooler *fixt
<RobotPinkie> ahhh, need to check that out
<Ilko> hulu has some episodes of burn notice i think.
<RobotPinkie> Can't watch Hulu from Sweden :(
<Doc> my name is bruce, man with the screaming brain and bubba ho-tep all suffer from serious pacing issues
<Dashite> Finally found it.
<WhiteTailed> 12Hello?

*HaveTubaWillTravel clings to RobotPinkie and cries
<WhiteTailed> 12Oh good I'm still here >v>
<HeavyMetalPony> Well fuuuuuu- it looks like the video's permanently disconnected for me. :(
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I love Bubba Hotep
<drfsupercenter> 03you can always use !ping
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Can't watch Hulu from pretty much any continent but North America.
<WhatPayne> Unless you are in US then hulu is unavailable to you.
<Elky> that sucks heavy

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Zecora> for the plot ?
<RobotPinkie> Not my favorite Don Coscarelli movie though
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had that forever
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I watched it for the plot, Ghosties.
<MrPoniator> I watch it for Colonel Campbell!
<kir13> i watch it for the plot
<RobotPinkie> Phantasm FTW!
<drfsupercenter> 03easiest way to check if you're still connected IMO :P
<WhiteTailed> 12I forgot about it
<HeavyMetalPony> ^
<Ghosties> 4I watch it for the Bruce Campbell
<HeavyMetalPony> this so much
<fehfryr> the quotes
<fehfryr> that you can share amongst friends
<Ghosties> 4And, honestly, Spiderman was good because of Bruce
<Doc> bad pacing can ruin even campbell
<The_Si> Bruce Campbell was the best part of Spider-Man 3.
*RobotPinkie pats HaveTubaWillTravel on the head
<Ghosties> 4Not in my book, Doc. I've got a huge man crush on Bruce
<Doc> so do I

<Aurora> 6so I'll be on campus from 9am to 9:45pm
<Nittany_Tiger_> Or it may be on Storm Chasers since Tim Samaras and crew were on the same storm we were on.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Twilight singer is best singer.
<RobotPinkie> Cheerilee lost that leg during the third great pony war. :(
<Zecora> manly tears !

<RobotPinkie> Itty bitty little widdle twinkie pinkie! <3
<Ziltoid> I love twinkies
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Inb4 penis
<WhatPayne> again my fav line
<HaveTubaWillTravel> "Twinkie" for Twilight/Pinkie is the second best-sounding ship name after Flutterpie.
<ReticentSmolder> I watch this for the plot http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/61471b2496d6eed21cef8a98e2500477/4839%20-%20fluttershy%20macro%20plot%20rarity%20twilight_sparkle.jpg

<MrPoniator> Totem pole!
<Elky> Tuba: I'll see your Twinkie and raise you Apple Pie.
<EspyLacopa> Hmmmm. I seem to have lost the stream.
<ReticentSmolder> did anyone see the behind the scenes vid of this?
<Nittany_Tiger_> So, Pinkie Pie found time to skate between rock farming?
<ingaesia> crasheriffic
<Pegacorn> brb
<DragonRage> DragonRage still thinks DashiePie is the best sounding ship name.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Another fine choice, Elky.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> How 'bout Rainbow Pie?
<ReticentSmolder> @Nittany_Tiger_ probably from the period where she lived with Granny Pie
<Elky> Pinkie works well with everyone... 'Moon Pie'
<Nittany_Tiger_> I don't remember that part.
<Pinkamina> Pielight Sparkle
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That... makes Pinkie's childhood timeline make a lot more sense, Smolder. Thanks for taking a weight off my nerdy shoulders. :D
<RobotPinkie> Nightmare Pie?
<MrPoniator> Poor porcupines :(
<Pinkamina> Flutterpie. Apple Pie. Rare Pie.
<Maxaminus_1> I get sad when I think about how Spike will outlive everypony by thousands of years.
<Pinkamina> yep... it is sad
<Pinkamina> Although umm, aren't unicorns near immortal?
<Elky> why would dragons live for that long?
<RainBroDash> 10NOT THE BEES
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Indeed. :( But we did get a great fic out of it in The Centerpiece of My Collection.
<ReticentSmolder> inb4 John Madden
<Maxaminus_1> Alicorns are, not unicorns.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Maybe Twilight will discover an immortality spell.
<RobotPinkie> induring NOT THE BEES
<Pinkamina> FOOTBALL!
<RainBroDash> 10AWGBLBL MY EYES
<HaveTubaWillTravel> SNAAAAA-KEY
<MrPoniator> I don't think it's a good idea to even wake up snakes when there's still snow around
<Nittany_Tiger_> Then...OVERPOPULATION!
<DragonRage> That one Dragon in Dragonshy was going to take a hundred year nap.
<RobotPinkie> Dragons must be very lonely creatures :(
<Maxaminus_1> They learn to live in the moment.
<Doc> they ease their pain with money
<WinstonChurchill> Anyone been watching the torchwood thing? Imagine that in Ponyville.
<MrPoniator> Well, they take 100 year naps
<MrPoniator> Maybe they just sleep all the time when their turn adults?
<Elky> huh, I forgot
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I think it's only alicorns that are immortal/live for thousands of years, but Twilight could do what Malachite in Suburban Knights did and cast a spell on her that slows her aging to the point of almost stopping.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> *on herself
<HeavyMetalPony> K, found Universe stream, just have to wait now uuu
<RobotPinkie> Jack Harkness pony would be cute :3

<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder >mfw that's the first thing I see when I come BACK to this chat after looking at that picture you sent me again
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yep. Buxom really is better.
<Maxaminus_1> There's a chance Twi would get turned into an Alicorn eventually anyway.
<RainBroDash> 10GET OUT OF MY HEAD ReticentSmolder
<HeavyMetalPony> I have a guitar, I'm a brony, and I don't know how to play this BGM
<HeavyMetalPony> Is something wrong with me?
<RainBroDash> 10yes
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<DragonRage> Get to learnin' it, man.
<MrPoniator> Spike, you're doing it wrong
<ingaesia> forever apone twilight
<Elky> inafter Applejack being perfectly reasonable
<RobotPinkie> We don't take kindly to unicorns around here!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I've always liked that idea, Maxaminus. One alicorn for day, one for night, one for Twilight :D
<HeavyMetalPony> Pssh, everybody knows Derpy's the third alicorn
<ingaesia> Rainbow Day inc
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Derpy can be Dawn. Her colours do fit it slightly.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Speaking of, inb4 Ditzy Doo :D

*RainBroDash 10loves this so much
<Pinkamina> ^ agreed
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Twilight's little "sorry" is Flutter-tier adorable.
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash loves the plot more
<Maxaminus_1> This is the episode where everypony learns the value of middle management.
<HeavyMetalPony> Ditsy Doo didn't fly the wrong way, all the other birds did
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder god damn you I wish you were wrong
<RobotPinkie> Why no team leader vest for Pinkie?
<Pinkamina> indeeed
<ReticentSmolder> Dear Princess Celestia
<Elky> because Pinkie worked alone at first
<Pinkamina> GIGA CLOUD BREAKER!!!
<MrPoniator> Clouds
<MrPoniator> How do they work?
<DragonRage> Pinkie Pie's part of the weather team, and Dash is the weather team leader.
<ReticentSmolder> RBD is the weather team leader, pinkie works under her as a lake scorer
<[Ger]Brony1> She is part of the weather-team, so Dash has the vest.
<RobotPinkie> Ahh
<DragonRage> Huzzah for herdmind.
<ValtheJean> @Robotpinkie the ice melter's actually isn't a real job. They just let Pinkie do that so she doesn't mess anything :P
<RobotPinkie> Clearly Pinkie should be the leader. :3
<DragonRage> And also for ditzy recolors.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I remember that theory, ValtheJean, and love it :D
<Maxaminus_1> And then next episode it's fall again.
<ValtheJean> lol
<MrPoniator> I find it weird how they turn winter in to spring... or more like summer in a day
<Pinkamina> EEEYUP
<RobotPinkie> Screw canon, I'm gonna sew a team leader vest for Pinkie
<HeavyMetalPony> is it still WWU, or next episode

<Maxaminus_1> That vest is hideous
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder you're losing your touch

*ReticentSmolder RainBroDash alighted on the balcony of the library. He had received a late night notice from derpy notifying him of something important that Twilight Sparkle needed to show him.

<DragonRage> That poor RainBro.
<Hipster_Brony> 8>mfw RBD was right
<RobotPinkie> We had a hearty laugh when he fell asleep on the ice... well, we're not laughing now.
<SirSprinkles> 6What you gonna do about it bro?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Spike must have narcolepsy.
<Razyn> It's okay RBD
<Elky> Switch Rarity with Rainbow Dash and it's true
<HeavyMetalPony> And then he drowned
<Pinkamina> yay...
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash, have some shipping
<DragonRage> There's no such thing as the worst pony/ponies.
<HeavyMetalPony> Except for Daisy
<RainBroDash> 10I'm gonna hide here and make sure I don't do anything else wrong :23
<RainBroDash> 10:3*
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Finally, someone has it right. Thank you DragonRage.
*Dashite slaps Hipster_Brony around a bit with a large trout
<Ghosties> 4So much kicking, oh my!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It's like saying "Timmy is my worst child."
<RainBroDash> 10Maxaminus_1 ohlol.
<Pinkamina> inb4 I get kicked even though im being quiet
<HeavyMetalPony> Fuck Timmy, Timmy can go to hell
<HaveTubaWillTravel> DEM FEATHERS
<Elky> well, maybe he is?
<Pinkamina> ...yay
<RobotPinkie> I like kicking! It involves hoofsies.
<RainBroDash> 10yay~
<Pegacorn> Timmy?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> First name that came to mind, HeavyMetal XD
<Pinkamina> Yay.
<Pinkamina> YAY...
*RainBroDash 10is full of yay
<RobotPinkie> QED, kicking is awesome.
<Pinkamina> Yaaaaaaaaaay~!
<DragonRage> Most yay ever.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> MUTE.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Couldn't use "Johnny" due to association with The Room
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 woohoo
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Avast her plot!
*Nittany_Tiger_ detects misuse of QED.
<RainBroDash> 10Lolipop_of_Doom, are you insane?
<Lolipop_of_Doom> inb4 way to o
<SirSprinkles> 6*records Pinkamina's hostname since he's here now*
*ReticentSmolder The air was chilly outside, and RainBroDash couldn't help but tuck his wings in as he knocked on the patio window. A small light flickered from somewhere deep within the library as he heard the sound of hoofsteps.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> *go
<Pinkamina> i actually like the theme song
<Lolipop_of_Doom> YAY spam
<Razyn> inb4 TURBO- o wait this is Euro stream
<HeavyMetalPony> *grabs popcorn in anticipation
<Pegacorn> Yo Johnny,what's up?
<Maxaminus_1> yay.
<RainbowLoon> darn, veemi.com keeps timeouting on me. guess no BMN for me tonight. feels bad pony
<Pinkamina> awww I love her yays... she's SO CUTE!
<MrPoniator> That's the best yay ever
<DragonRage> Woo.
<Maxaminus_1> ooh
<Elky> I like the theme song of all the shows I watch
<RobotPinkie> Kicking involves hoofsies, therefore kicking is awesome. QED correctly used. :P
<Cone> Wtf it's JUST this network!
<Pinkamina> way to go
<Cone> !ping
<drfsupercenter> !pong
<DragonRage> One hoof bad, two hooves good.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Way to go.
<RobotPinkie> Lips flapping in the wind
<Nittany_Tiger_> So are hoofsies awesome?
<Razyn> 'Swat you get for trying to be supermare
*ReticentSmolder He was tired after a long day's work, and desperately wanted some sleep, but Twilight had been insistent that she join him in something tonight, whatever that may be.
<Pinkamina> You rock, woohoo
<HeavyMetalPony> Yay was ruined for me thanks to troll youtube's top rated comments
<Maxaminus_1> lol, every single book falls down
<MrPoniator> Fluttershy's cheering was super effective
<RobotPinkie> Do you even need to ask, Nittany? :3
<Lolipop_of_Doom> woohoo.
<Nittany_Tiger_> No.
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash should I keep going?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I know, HeavyMetal. Youtube commenters are why we can't have nice things.
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder if you wish, I am reading it :3 (and saving it)
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And please, Smolder. RainBro gets the final say of course, but...
<RainBroDash> 10although >twilight :P
*Razyn is disappointed in himself for not yet finishing Pizza Dough
<Pegacorn> Who's streaming?
<RobotPinkie> lol no, it's not really correct usage either way since I have not demonstrated logically that hoofsies are awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am, Pegacorn
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, I know, but I've already shipped you with Rainbow Dash and having two RBD's is a little confusing
<HeavyMetalPony> Friend: Why didn't Flutteshy enter the competition?
<HeavyMetalPony> Me: Because she'd win

<Light_Latias> 12kay
<HeavyMetalPony> EpsyLacopa: mine's just a blank white screen. Guess Pinkie Pie was upset with the movie choices tonight

<HaveTubaWillTravel> By that point, they were too far behind to see it was her, RobotPinkie. Or something.
<RainBroDash> 10like, rainbooms aside. She's just amazing.
<drfsupercenter> 03I swear I've heard it as that for years
<DragonRage> Technically, Reps/Dumbbell/whatever his name is was out cold when she did it.
<drfsupercenter> 03never thought anyone else did!
*ReticentSmolder Twilight Sparkle blushed and averted eye contact for a moment while hoofing the floor. "Well, I recently came into possession of a new book, but I have no context to understand it, and none of my friends can help...well, you'll see when I show it to you."

<Light_Latias> 12even if you ARE super
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Ah, that's it, DragonRage. Haven't seen Chronicles in a while, and when I do watch it, I'm always focused on Rainbow's awesomeness.

<RainBroDash> 10Razyn: Come at me
*ReticentSmolder Confused, but curious RainBroDash followed Twilight down a flight of stairs and into the atrium of the library. It was completely dark save for the single candle floating beside them enveloped in a purple sheen.
<Elky> it's not a best cartwheel unless a pony is kicked
<Light_Latias> 12as opposed to dead?
<Light_Latias> 12good
*Light_Latias 12shot

<HaveTubaWillTravel> For all we know, HeavyMetalPony?

<HaveTubaWillTravel> That's one theory about Fluttershy's parentage.
<Light_Latias> 12I like a few of his songs
*ReticentSmolder The pair approached a large lectern where a single tome was seated. Upon closer inspection RainBroDash could make out the title: "The Pony Sutra."
<Light_Latias> 12but only a few :/

<The_Si> WAAAAAH.
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<Skylands> 10Ignore typo
<drfsupercenter> 03but wtf buying 50 shirts
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That would also explain the lack of natural weather/seasons, Max.

<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<RobotPinkie> Are you saying this is the not too distant future?
<drfsupercenter> 03and most of mine were either on shirt.woot for $10 or the random Kohl's ones for around that too

<Nittany_Tiger_> Just not everywhere.
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend Helios is posting MLP links on Facebook
<drfsupercenter> 03should I unfriend him y/n
<Elky> rainbow dash wishes she could dress in style
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, before I forget, when we revise the rules, how are we going to put up an image for them? Oo
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It could be a post-apocalptic world so far ahead no-one remembers the apocalpse, like Adventure Time
<Doc> jeanine melnitz pony
<Skylands> 10No
<Light_Latias> 12Danny D:
<Razyn> ReticentSmolder: end the story like that.
<drfsupercenter> 03first he tells me he's "half furry"

<ReticentSmolder> I could continue it, if enough people convinced me :P
<DragonRage> ... I like Rarity. ;_;
<Light_Latias> 12as you're thankfully doing me >:|
<Light_Latias> 12...rhyme ><;
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm thankfully doing you yes
*drfsupercenter runs
<RainBroDash> 10DragonRage, but you're wrong!
<Ziltoid> rarity is a big meanie
<RobotPinkie> on the satellite of love and tolerance
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Elky> because Rarity is actually a well-developed character, unlike Rainbow Dash
*Light_Latias 12walked into that o-x

<HeavyMetalPony> Rarity didn't mean to act like she did in this episode, she was just possessed by FABULOSITY
<SirSprinkles> 6...RainBro really wants to lose that promotion he just got.
<RainBroDash> 10Elky you take that back. NOW.
<Elky> make me
<ReticentSmolder> I believe that Applejack actually falls pretty low in the polls for bestpony
<RobotPinkie> I love both Rarity and Applejack :3
*HaveTubaWillTravel groans. Not this again.
<drfsupercenter> 03Katie Forche likes Disney and 14 other pages. <- Why does that not surprise me?
<DragonRage> =/ I like Dashie too. I even wrote a fanfic with her as the main character.
<RainBroDash> 10Elky, but. But. NUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dusky> harbour showers SUCK
<Razyn> RainBroDash, I have found the only counter argument to your claim that RD is best pony.
<Pinkamina> SPARTA!
<Doc> everypony is best pony!

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL THEY EVEN PUT A U IN THE WORD HARBOR? LOL UK SPELLING LOL
<Maxaminus_1> In the story I read a merchant jumpship belonging to the Terran Hegemony suffers a misjump and ends up in orbit around Equestria. What followed was a...diplomatic incident.
<Hipster_Brony> dunno
<Dusky> 0.70 eurocent for a coin that last 5 mins >.>
<Pinkamina> Twilight Smargle :)
<Light_Latias> 12WHY THE ALLCAPS?
<Dusky> and lol, get used to dialect languages!
<ingaesia> >Celestia controls the sun, makes no attempt to rescue
<drfsupercenter> 03why not?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Mythological references for the win.
<RainBroDash> 10Razyn , lol'd.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<RobotPinkie> show wouldn't be the same without all ponies
<Ghosties> *shrugs*
<Light_Latias> 12IT'S ANNOYING SPEAKING IN ALLCAPS :3
<SilverSonic> LL I just saw the nickalert and LOL "punny"
<DragonRage> Fluttershy's cheering is so adorable.
*Light_Latias 12flees
<Elky> well, it'd be the same eithout the bg ponies
<Dashite> Rayzn, lol
<RobotPinkie> Celestia is omniscient, she knew Dash is best flyer in all of Equestria
<HaveTubaWillTravel> >implying Derpy, as a symbolic representation of the fandom's relationship with the production team, isn't *one* of the best ponies
<RainBroDash> 10BEST DAY EVER. BEST PONY EVER.
<ValtheJean> Celestia is a jealous troll :P
<Elky> ugh, don't get me started on derpy
<Hipster_Brony> 8dash just did something no pony else can do
<HeavyMetalPony> Can I race to the bathroom, get my alternate stream ready, and start it on synch in time? Challenge Accepted, encouragement appreciated
<Pinkamina> well Derpy is pretty awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8u mad wonderbolts?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
<ReticentSmolder> @Razyn, I would continue the fic, but I'm needed for movie trivia now :D
<Elky> Rainbow's a Mary Sue
<RobotPinkie> come at me wonderbolts!
<RainBroDash> 10dat wingboner
<Elky> umad hipster?
<Maxaminus_1> Celestia is the Sun, the Alicorn is just an avatar. She's too busy fusing hydrogen to worry about ponies.
<Pinkamina> Mary Sue? Nobody in that show is a Mary Sue.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> This episodes moral is quite generic.... I kind of like that. Allows kids to draw their own conclusion from it.
<ValtheJean> I like how Elky is tempting fate, power to you bro :P
<Dashite> You saved our lives, we are eternally grateful /lgms
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And adults, of course.
<RainBroDash> 10also: I need to read a good SpitfirexDash after this.
<Pinkamina> I mean she'd be as bad as Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way if she was a Mary Sue
<SirSprinkles> 6LIES. I should go to Derpy.
<ingaesia> read: "With a Spark"
<SirSprinkles> 6*It
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And to be fair, rainbow hair is often a symptom of Mary Sue-ness. Doesn't mean RBD is one, just sayin'.
<DragonRage> Nopony is a Mary Sue. I know the accusations are usually just people joking, but it still bugs me when that trope gets thrown around all willy nilly.
<ReticentSmolder> @ingaesia he has, he wasn't a fan
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Celestia also has it, too.
<RobotPinkie> I learned how fabulous I am
<ingaesia> hahaha
<Maxaminus_1> Rarity is old enough to know better.
<Razyn> ...We now need a SirSprinkles x Derpy fic.
<Razyn> He needs to go to Derpy
<WinstonChurchill> Threesome on the sun. Love it.
<Pegacorn> PLANS.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> But not the best NIGHT ever.
<RainBroDash> 10ingaesia. I have done... All my happiness was lost ;_; That fic was amazing
<ingaesia> RainBroDash I liked the twist in it
<Doc> implied threesome
<Ziltoid> FREEENNNNNSSSS
<Ghosties> And with that, I believe I will take my leave. You guys won't need me for Across the Universe, will you?
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 we're all high
<Gnorri> @rainbrodash, sorry for the waiting, the problem is "connection cancelled"
<Maxaminus_1> And then they went back to Spitfire's apartment and fucked. The end.
<RainBroDash> 10ingaesia it was amazing. Never have I enjoyed a twist so much.
<Pegacorn> Across the Universe time!
<Light_Latias> 12SS
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Light_Latias> 12the song cut off for a bit o.o

*ReticentSmolder RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA SINCE SILVERSCREEN IS LAZY: The movie aired on John Lennon's birthday
<DragonRage> It does now.
<Elky> yes it does
<HeavyMetalPony> ^That's awesome
<RainBroDash> what about teh ruuuulezz? I guess you're coming back at the end?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm gonna step outside and smoke a... cigarette...
<Gnorri> no problem, i'll try to fix it... someway
<Ghosties> If we're gonna do the rules later today, then sure
<Maxaminus_1> How does this movie compare to Enter the Void?
<Ghosties> I'll return for that
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, Ghosties, at least be here in 2 hours so we can do that.
<Hipster_Brony> lol sprinkles
<RainBroDash> alrighty. I'm gonna sit here and enjoy me some Beatles maynn.

<HeavyMetalPony> I love this song! Wait it's The Beatles...I love all their songs
<Maxaminus_1> A musical???
<drfsupercenter> 03this is the remix they play on the radio
<SirSprinkles> 6PSSSSSSST. IT'S NOT REALLY A CIGARETTE.

<Elky> guuuuuuurl
<RainBroDash> 10HeavyMetalPony. I'm spending the next 2 hours preparing myself for belting Hey Jude as loud as I fracking can
*ReticentSmolder Disclaimer: there is singing
<Ignaesia> Connection times out :(
<HeavyMetalPony> D:
<Maxaminus_1> Is this a Beatles musical? Is that what this is???
*ReticentSmolder Background: the movie follows events preceding and during the conflict in Vietnam
<RainBroDash> 10Maxaminus_1 practically, yup
<Maxaminus_1> :O
*ReticentSmolder this is a beatles inspired musical
<HeavyMetalPony> I'm freaking terrified that my stream will buffer for two hours at any given moment
<HeavyMetalPony> fuuuuuu- the moment i posted it it happened
<RainBroDash> 10HeavyMetalPony XD
*ReticentSmolder Other than backstory, this song is useless imo, just shows her and her boyfriend before he ships off
<Sathi> See you in a bit Ghosties
<prince-dari> MFW waiting for 7 PM, fall asleep and miss that too.
*ReticentSmolder Jude, played by Jim Sturgess, is supposed to mirror the life of John Lennon
<Elky> ohai dari
<HeavyMetalPony> *sigh to youtube: did the title appear yet? or is it still helter skelter
<RainBroDash> 10prince-dari yo yo homo
<Ziltoid> hi prince-dari
<HeavyMetalPony> oh hey dari
<ReticentSmolder> @HeavyMetalPony we're past it :(
<prince-dari> Hey everyone.
<Sathi> 7hey prince-dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Elky> wait, was Evil Dead 3 less than 90 minutes long?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Hey Dari. Sorry about the sleep thing D:
<RobotPinkie> ohai dari
<Elky> it's still so early...
<ReticentSmolder> Jude works on a shipyard in...Leeds I think
<HeavyMetalPony> I think IMBd said 87
<HeavyMetalPony> ^but I may have forgotten
<Light_Latias> 12brbs
<Gnorri> lol, the streaming don't work, so i'm watching it on "megavideo"
<HeavyMetalPony> XD
<Elky> wiki says 81-96, depending on the cut
<HaveTubaWillTravel> OOHHHH! I GET IT!
<ReticentSmolder> gl with that Gnorri, say hi at the 75 minute mark :P
<Elky> still, that's darn short
<SilverSonic> <Light_Latias> SS
<SilverSonic> <Light_Latias> the song cut off for a bit o.o <-- Yeah SAM is like that x.x
<HeavyMetalPony> WHy do they all have British accents?
<ReticentSmolder> if you have any questions or are confused speak up
<DragonRage> DragonRage's brain is full of accent now. I can't even think straight.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It was average length when it was released, Elky. Now movies get laughed out of the room if they aren't at least 120 minutes >.>
<ReticentSmolder> @HeavyMetalPony this is in Leeds
<RainBroDash> 10HeavyMetalPony... it's in britain
<SirSprinkles> 6...I got lost trying to find my computer. XD
<HeavyMetalPony> :trollface:
<RainBroDash> O.o
<Elky> didn't know it changed litke that
<ReticentSmolder> These are photos of his estranged father he never knew
<SirSprinkles> 6Because... *cigarette*
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I don't either, Elky. Since society is getting more and more "I want it now now now," you'd think movies would get SHORTER.
<Sathi> 7and I
<Elky> I guess people want more movie for their buck
<ReticentSmolder> yup
<HeavyMetalPony> ReticentSmolder: Hey I'm only 10 seconds behind. Pretty decent for a blind start
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Good theory. Either that or directors just want to prove their balls are bigger than others'.
<RobotPinkie> I like long movies
<Ignaesia> im stuck with "Connection times out" over and over
<RobotPinkie> Some pretty epic Bollywood movies out there. :3
<Elky> well, the best movies are often the long ones
*ReticentSmolder nice, anywho, Jude is stowing away on one of the cargo vessels he worked on, *illegally* this comes in later
<SirSprinkles> 6What's the problem, Ignaesia?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Good point, RobotPinkie. Maybe it has to do with more cultural mixing, and Hollywood learning from Bollywood.
<Ignaesia> I keep getting "Connection Timed Out" tried multiple browsers/refreshes/restarted
<SirSprinkles> 6Suddenly lesbians.
<Sathi> 7did you try clearing your cache?
<Elky> where?
<Ignaesia> hmm not that... brb
<RobotPinkie> Also I'm partial to big budget Bollywood movies
<SirSprinkles> 6For the stream, Ignaesia?
<HeavyMetalPony> Still, the best movies are the ones you don't really have to pay attention to because they have awesome music
*ReticentSmolder Right now the war seems pretty distant and unimportant compared to the high-school shenanigans. Prudence is a girl who has a crush on another girl in high school and ends up running away from home after receiving a fierce beating, either from her old boyfriend or from her parents.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Agreed, HeavyMetal. Funny how that doesn't work *as* well with visuals.
<Elky> prudence is a real name?
<HeavyMetalPony> What song is it now?
<ReticentSmolder> @Elky yes
<ReticentSmolder> I wanna hold your hand
*ReticentSmolder The Cavernous club seen in the UK side of the alternating vignettes at the opening of the film is the 'New' Cavern Club in Liverpool. The original Cavern Club where the where The Beatles played in the 60s was closed in 1973 and the site became a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's underground railway.
<HeavyMetalPony> ok good
<Elky> sounds old fashioned, like Fürchtegott or something
<Ignaesia> Connection Timed Out again
<HeavyMetalPony> Deeeear Furchtegott...
<ReticentSmolder> Slowly...the characters assemble
<SirSprinkles> 6Ignaesia, sent you a PM
<RobotPinkie> lolol I'd pick Rang De Basanti as the A-movie if I ever win the lottery, but I think someone might murder me if I do that. :P
<HeavyMetalPony> I have a feeling this movie won't make any sense until half way through
<Elky> it can't be worse than spider's web
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Wouldn't be the first timme someone's trolled with their movie selection ;)
<HaveTubaWillTravel> *time
<Hipster_Brony> lol sprinkles
<HeavyMetalPony> :P

<ReticentSmolder> @HeavyMetalPony right now Jude is searching for his lost father, who served in Britain during WW2

<HeavyMetalPony> I'd wait until I actually get what I want before trolling
<RobotPinkie> Oh it's like... one of the best movies of all time, it's not really intended as a troll
<DragonRage> Ah yeah, this was around where I lost my connection last night.
<Hipster_Brony> take a look at this: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61rY6yM8HWL._SL500_AA300_.jpg

*ReticentSmolder I assure you, I wasn't trolling when I chose this.
<SirSprinkles> 6O hai dari
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That's something I've been meaning to ask the mods, actually. What's your policy on movies with subtitles which have no existing English dubs?
<prince-dari> Hey.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I can imagine it would be quite a polarising topic among the viewers.
<junh1024-XD> !eww test
<drfsupercenter> 12EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TEST
<Elky> I believe we had a conversation about that and the mods said it'd be okay

<RainBroDash> 10havetubawilltravel I've always wondered what the -viewers- think about that

<Sathi> optical illusion
<Elky> or was that only about foreign movies in general?
<Elky> hm
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I myself would be more than okay with reading subtitles, but I can imagine how someponies wouldn't be.
<SirSprinkles> 6Tuba, it's something that the mods would likely vote on when the movie is picked.
<prince-dari> Doesn't move when I look at it.
<RobotPinkie> Well, is 3 hour movie okay? :P
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a case-by-case basis.
*ReticentSmolder During the number "With a Little Help From My Friends," a prominent poster of actress Brigitte Bardot is a reference to John Lennon's life-long obsession with her.

<ReticentSmolder> ^^that's coming up
<HeavyMetalPony> Well if there's a foreign movie of good enough quality should it even matter?

<HeavyMetalPony> You can't type that RobotPinkie! That's coppppywrightz
<HaveTubaWillTravel> When is high school *not* boring, though?
<Light_Latias> 12...
<RainBroDash> 10HaveTubaWillTravel when it's british :P
<RobotPinkie> lol not like that
<Sathi> can't open it here either
<HaveTubaWillTravel> But that's not high school. It's secondary school/sixth form D:
*ReticentSmolder The high school parts are showing the life before America went to war, a more carefree environment more influenced by 50's culture. This changes as they transition into college.
<prince-dari> But then it's secondary school, RBD.

<RobotPinkie> His dad used to be in the closet, I guess?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 !pacman
<DragonRage> His... lack of a haircut.
<RobotPinkie> Now he proudly proclaims his love of ponies.
<RainBroDash> 10ITT: People tell RBD things he evidently would know, since he did actually go to school
<HeavyMetalPony> Harry Potter?
<prince-dari> Which means anyone who refreshes now can't open the stream.
<RainBroDash> 10O_O
<SirSprinkles> 6Getting any sort of error message?
<DragonRage> Man, the 50s must have been weird if they could look at hair like that and say "omg you never cut it do you".
<prince-dari> Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): The connection was reset.
<Light_Latias> 12no
<ReticentSmolder> @DragonRage, haircuts tended to be pretty conservative for guys back then
<RobotPinkie> suddenly, pinky
<RobotPinkie> pinkie, even
<GGgala> pinkie broke the fourth wall again
<ReticentSmolder> inb4 awkward
<Maxaminus_1> Jude killed the chat

<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUU
<RobotPinkie> Hey jude.... don't kill the chat
<Elky> I like this movie so far, I wouldn't care if it was all exposition
<HeavyMetalPony> Jude: I have no f*cking idea
<ReticentSmolder> @Elky, oh, it gets juicier, trust me
<RainBroDash> 10ohai silver
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god
<Silverscreen> 11I'm back.
<drfsupercenter> 03my CPU is at like 60C
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn it, stupid broken cooler
<drfsupercenter> 03that might explain why it's so hot in here too >_>
*drfsupercenter stabs Ultra Products for taking more than a day to give me a replacement
<ReticentSmolder> hey Lazy
<Elky> 'juicier'
<Silverscreen> 11:P
<ReticentSmolder> :D
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, it picks up speed like Charlie Sheen.
<HeavyMetalPony> howdy Silver
<DragonRage> Hiya Silverscreen.
<Sathi> yep
<ReticentSmolder> @Elky, it gets *really* dark and heavy in a couple of minutes, kind of catches you by surprise
<Sathi> just tried switching browser
<RobotPinkie> and then lies in the gutter, all strung out and twitching, for a while
<SirSprinkles> 6Is it only occuring on Chrome?
<HeavyMetalPony> Can't get "I'm stuffed enough thanks" out of my head
<Sathi> no
<Elky> well, now it won't catch me by surprise anymore
<Sathi> Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage
<HeavyMetalPony> ^ :/
<Ignaesia> Had "Connection Timed out" the entire time, guess im going to miss this movie
<ReticentSmolder> This is one of my favorite scenes
<SirSprinkles> 6Gog. Damn. It.
<DragonRage> I feel for ya, man.
<RobotPinkie> This is the dark part
<HeavyMetalPony> Jude shit is the best shit
<RainBroDash> 10There's some serious problems with Veemi at the moment :S
<RobotPinkie> They don't know how to fucking bowl :(
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Is this the dark turn you were talking about, Smolder?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> ;)
<HeavyMetalPony> well they are british
<DragonRage> Jude, that's not how you bowl!
<ReticentSmolder> @RobotPinkie, wait, you mean you aren't SUPPOSED to use your head?
<Hipster_Brony> still works fine for me
<Sathi> 7yep looks like their down...
<Hipster_Brony> on chrome
<HyperMetalLugia> o,x,'
<RobotPinkie> Not while it's still attached, in any case!
<Sathi> rejoining the stream?
<ReticentSmolder> @Tuba, its around the time Max gets a letter
<Silverscreen> It appears my internet is derping.
<HeavyMetalPony> This is dark, they all suffer concussions
<DragonRage> My Gods, the sheer number of penalties in that scene.
<GGgala> i can't tell if t he cameraman is on acid or not
<HaveTubaWillTravel> IT'LL BE A GAS
<WhatPayne> Whoa, this place really emptied...
<RobotPinkie> Fucking bowling. How does that work?
*ReticentSmolder The light-hearted and more jovial scenes depict a psychadelic influence reminiscent of the pervasion of drugs in early 70's and late 60's culture.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> lol, Windows Movie Maker Rainbow
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Still a fun scene though :)
<HeavyMetalPony> orgies...gas...eh I don't really like mixing those two up
<WhatPayne> Will there be afterhow? y'know vids n' stuff?
*ReticentSmolder MOVIE TRIVIA: this chick edition: Sadie, with her fiery red hair and passionate temper, is a reference to Janis Joplin. Sadie is even seen drinking directly from a Jack Daniels bottle during her downward spiral, an action that Janis did regularly with Southern Comfort. Even Janis' throaty singing voice is used by Sadie in the movie.
<Ignaesia> WhatPayne because there are problems with the stream, many can't connect to veemi
<WhatPayne> oh... ok
<Elky> >drinking more than a sip of southern comfort at once
<Hipster_Brony> like i said, in and out
<Elky> ugh
<HeavyMetalPony> Grr, stream derped. Where are we?
<Sathi> odd
<ReticentSmolder> @HeavyMetalPony they're meeting Sadie and getting their first apartment
<DragonRage> What a fox.
<HeavyMetalPony> room room room
<HeavyMetalPony> *vroom vroom vroom
<SathiTest> bla
*ReticentSmolder The concepts of cougars is new to Max :D
<Hipster_Brony> i mean, im not paying attention from time to time
<RobotPinkie> Two BMNs, two movies I need to add to my collection. Nice work.
<DragonRage> ... man, those apartments are depressing.
<Hipster_Brony> not that my stream is cutting out
<Sathi> The webpage at http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=BronyState&vw=700&vh=520&domain=www.bronystate.co.cc might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.
<Sathi> in chrome
<GGgala> shit's gonna get real
<HeavyMetalPony> haha, it's funny because this is a Beatles movie. Get it? GET IT?
<Ziltoid> How do video requests work?
*Silverscreen can't see the stream. -.-
<SirSprinkles> 6It works fine for me.
<Sathi> used the other site this time, as I did not want to ruin my current stream
<RobotPinkie> Awesome scene.
<ReticentSmolder> @DragonRage those are converted tenement buildings in New York, built during the industrial era many lacked any real health codes or basic concepts like outward facing windows
<Elky> so when will the dark part start?
<Gnorri> ♪let it beeeeeeeee ♫
<HeavyMetalPony> Are requests for both streams or are there two for both
<SirSprinkles> 6Sathi, that page won't work normally.
<DragonRage> Shit Ret, the 50s-70s sucked. =/
<Aurora> 6bye all, I gotta go to work
*ReticentSmolder This scene describes racial tension and riots during the civil rights movement ocurring at around the same time as Vietnam.
<Aurora> 6stupid
<Aurora> 6work
<Aurora> 6D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Try http://www.veemi.com/view.php?v=BronyState
<SirSprinkles> 6IIRC
<Sathi> ok
*ReticentSmolder Manly tears were shed when I first saw this.
<RobotPinkie> Genuine manly tears scene
<RobotPinkie> lol hivemind
<Freyskol> pudding
<Elky> no tears yet, but it's pretty touching yes
<Nittany_Tiger> Herd, not hivemind.
<Sathi> Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to www.veemi.com
<Gnorri> no more nigga stole my bike, but white man stole my rights
<Dusky> :P
<DragonRage> Agreed, Elky.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry, I got it wrong.
<ReticentSmolder> This is how the character JoJo, aka the Jimi Hendrix clone, is introduced
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<RobotPinkie> No, I am the Borg
<SirSprinkles> 6It's http://www.veemi.com/watch.php?v=BronyState
*ReticentSmolder The character of JoJo is a clear reference to Jimi Hendrix. Sadie dresses him up in the purple shirt and bandanna - one of Jimi's most famous stage costumes. JoJo also plays a Fender guitar - the same brand played by his prototype, Jimi Hendrix.
<Gnorri> man, this cover is... fantastic
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay, you're right. :P
<Sathi> trying
<ReticentSmolder> @Gnorri, glad to hear it man, last night heard a LOT of bashing on these scenes
<Nittany_Tiger> My Little Borg: Resistance is Futile.
<Sathi> nope
<Elky> I don't really like the original, but this cover isn't bad
<HeavyMetalPony> D:
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually.
<RobotPinkie> I'd read that fanfic :P
<HeavyMetalPony> I have mixed feelings on the cover
<Nittany_Tiger> My Little Pony: Resistance is Futile.
<RainBroDash> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://www.veemi.com/view.php?v=BronyState
<SirSprinkles> 6TF?
<Nittany_Tiger> It is.
<RainBroDash> open that sprinkles
<ReticentSmolder> I think its a nice cover, maybe not stand alone, but fits well into the picture
<HeavyMetalPony> is cover over?
<Sathi> lol
<Sathi> It's not just you! http://www.veemi.com looks down from here.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yep, Heavy
<HeavyMetalPony> because I just started to like it
<HaveTubaWillTravel> We're just meeting JoJo now.
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl
*ReticentSmolder This is JoJo by the way, the previous scene also showed Lucy attending her boyfriend's funeral.
<RobotPinkie> Oh THIS is definitely one of my favorite songs in the movie
<HeavyMetalPony> Gotta catch my bus
<SirSprinkles> 6...I tried the EBS, and it appears to be all of veemi.
<ReticentSmolder> Last night >suddenly, epic Pimp solo
<Nittany_Tiger> [16:51:47]	RobotPinkie	I'd read that fanfic <- Is there actually Pony/Borg or Pony/Star Wars crossover fic?
<junh1024-XD> >:3
<Nittany_Tiger> Star Trek
<Nittany_Tiger> Dammit.
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, I kinda hope so
<Light_Latias> 12:<
<ReticentSmolder> @Nittany, there is a Starcraft fic if that counts
*Light_Latias 12sits on junh
<HeavyMetalPony> Now someone ressurect zombie Hendrix and make him cover Come Together
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder haha really?
<Nittany_Tiger> Normally, I hate musicals, but I actually dig the singing in this.
<RobotPinkie> I hope it's TNG, if there is. :P
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I don't know. We'd need the Necronomicon for that, HeavyMetal, not to mention someone who could remember the spells written there. And nopony can.
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess because it isn't something like a Disney cartoon.
<RobotPinkie> or Enterprise... most underrated trek ever.
*ReticentSmolder That peculiar fashion is a zoot suit, sported by the Mexican-American gansters of LA mainly as a charicature of the common 50's working man.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Also, agreed, Nittany, except without the part about hating musicals. XD
<Elky> why would anyone hate musicals?
<Nittany_Tiger> I do.
<Nittany_Tiger> They're stupid.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I love musicals and I love Disney cartoons, but the latter are bad examples of the former. If that makes sense.
*ReticentSmolder In the beginning of "Come Together", the man in the station is playing air guitar with his left hand strumming. Probably a reference to Paul McCartney being left-handed.
<Hipster_Brony> if veemi is down, how am i still watching the movie o.O
<GGgala> i thought zoot suits were a 1920s style?
<HeavyMetalPony> Hellfire disproves your point
<RobotPinkie> love classic musicals. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly stuff
<SirSprinkles> 6I have NO idea.
<Elky> I dunno, you've got a movie and some awesome songs in it. What's not to like?
<Nittany_Tiger> Who sings while doing stuff?
*Skylands meeps
<RainBroDash> crazy shit
<SirSprinkles> 6I am WAY to high for this shit.
<RobotPinkie> I do!
<SirSprinkles> 6*too
<RainBroDash> 10Nittany_Tiger who doesn't :P
<Sathi> we're all high!
<ReticentSmolder> @GGala they lasted awhile, the style lasting through multiple generations and alterations, that's just the origin of the style
<Skylands> 10hey Light
<Elky> I don't
<Elky> but ponies do
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Well, who has to fight their way through legions of zombies or orks?
<Light_Latias> 12Laa
<Skylands> 10did you know Warriors super edition #3 is out?
<Skylands> 10Crookedstar's Promise
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Musicals aren't any less absurd than other fantasy concepts.

<Hipster_Brony> HIGH ON LIFE!

<SirSprinkles> 6All the tech problems lately.
<HeavyMetalPony> She came in through the bathroom window? :D
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That said, musicals where everyone sings about everything that happens are bad examples of the genre. Like Rock-A-Doodle.
<Light_Latias> 12ogawd
<RobotPinkie> I find Singing in the Rain 100 times more plausible than pretty much any given fantasy movie.
<HeavyMetalPony> I am so smart. I am so smart.
<Aeroslash> it's finally here, the 5th one
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I'M TALK-ING, I'M TALK-ING, I'M DRINK-ING MY COFF-EE

<Light_Latias> 12and after that we wait till April for the conclusion...
<Hipster_Brony> >best album ever made
<ReticentSmolder> Prudence has a crush on Sadie from the very beginning
<Light_Latias> 12T-T
<Skylands> 10Yes x.x
<Elky> who wouldn'T?
<Skylands> 10Erin Hunter is slow
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Applejack? What are you doing in this movie?
<ReticentSmolder> keep in mind Lesbians and gays were actively persecuted during the 60's
*Light_Latias 12nods :<
<SirSprinkles> 6Well then... I'm going to update the Home page and put up the new thread.

<Elky> keep them ret
<SirSprinkles> 6Home page updated.

<Dusky> yep
<RobotPinkie> Well I followed them yesterday, but they WERE very interesting :3
*Skylands will check it out anyway

<DragonRage> Your little burbs are good.
<Light_Latias> 12pass :|
<DragonRage> blurbs.
<Elky> burps
<Dusky> do it, its kills like 5 mins of time
<Dusky> xDD
<DragonRage> I have been making so many typos today. =/
<Sneas> 03$130 a month for internet (that is 140 KB max for download and 20 KB max for upload) and telephone service
<Dusky> not counting download timez :P
<Aeroslash> my friend was torturing me with nyan cat on the phone D:
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, I kind of got into it last night, giving some analysis as well as trivia for people who refused to actually watch the movie
<Hipster_Brony> cool beans
<Dusky> i have nyancat for iPad
<Dusky> ?:D
<Skylands> 10Released: June 30, 2011
<Sneas> 03Switching to Suddenlink for internet and telephone for like $70 a month
<Skylands> 10and no updates? Sad
<Elky> eh, it's hard to watch a movie with turbo chat next to it
<Dusky> trololo'ed restaurant with the nyancat app >:D
*ReticentSmolder Jude doesn't have to worry about the draft because he is in the US illegally, much like John Lennon
<RobotPinkie> A pony's gotta do what a pony's gotta do.
<Dusky> atleast the nearest 2 tables
<Sneas> 03Not exactly sure what the speeds are though, need to ask them but I've asked people and they say it's better
<Elky> (which is why saturday stream is best stream)
*ReticentSmolder Jude's life progression is similar to John Lennon's. As John Lennon did, Jude first lived in Liverpool then soon after that moved to New York City to work as an artist like Lennon. Jude then encounters trouble with the law and is deported (Lennon was arrested as well, but an attempt to deport him failed).
<HeavyMetalPony> ^At least you have a continuous stream Elky
<Skylands> 10lolvideointro
<Sneas> 0390% chance it's better

<Gnorri> how about a fanfic about vietnam war?
<MtChar> we got frontier too
<MtChar> after they bitch slapped verizon
<HeavyMetalPony> :D No, it's so pathetic of me it's hilarious
<ReticentSmolder> I wish I could hand you my stream, I've seen this countless times
<Sathi> What was needed to be updated on the about page? I believe you mentioned something earlier
<MtChar> too bad its basically the only ISP aroun
<RainBroDash> At some point the lottery selection method part needs to be updated
*Light_Latias 12><
<Light_Latias> 12I hate Mibbit ads

<Sathi> RBD see skypechat ;) Dari had a plan
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Aeroslash> brb updates
*ReticentSmolder Last night people were wondering why a cop was here. This area is close to the port, and the many warehouses were often infested with vagrants and squatters, forcing police to patrol them more actively to move the homeless out of private areas.

*ReticentSmolder Lucy is coming to terms that she likes Jude even though just a short time ago she was grieving for her dead boyfriend.
<Articuno> 12and she's never even met Xai yet.. she couldn't make my engagement party in 2008.. I'm scared she won't make our wedding..

<Elky> No! Come out!
<Light_Latias> 12good luck
<HeavyMetalPony> Yeah, thanks Reticent I appreciate the inchat synopsis
*ReticentSmolder According to Julie Taymor she used 30 songs of The Beatles as a basis for the script that covers events from 1963 to 1969, but in the film those 6 years are compressed into two years.
<MtChar> which is retarded
<ReticentSmolder> AND THEN THEY FUCKED
<SirSprinkles> 6nope
<HeavyMetalPony> In 60s all love=sexy time
<Sneas> 03Like to rip people off I think
<RobotPinkie> ...pony penetration?
*ReticentSmolder inb4 everyone's favorite scene
<CaitSith> Also, that isn't my usual speed. My net speed is usually about 10MB/s on both.
<HeavyMetalPony> Jude too tired to notice: Have fun on your date
<RainBroDash> 10amazing scene :>
<PegacornBackup> .....Oh god.The intenet glitched.
<DragonRage> What

<ReticentSmolder> tons of symbolism
<MtChar> yeah well
<MtChar> i would love to have 10MB/s
<MtChar> but no
<DragonRage> My mind is full of holy crap.
<MtChar> i get .3 on up and 1 on down
<HaveTubaWillTravel> My brain is full of Beatles and I LOVE IT
<SilverSonic> LL, you enjoy the show?
<Elky> yes, that scene is indeed amazing
*ReticentSmolder This scene depicts the dehumanization of soldiers during the draft, basically another face in the crowd fighting for Uncle Sam
<HeavyMetalPony> dat beat
<HeavyMetalPony> better drink my own...whatever
<DragonRage> This entire scene is amazing. Freaky, but amazing.
<WhatPayne> dat choreography
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Elky> dat oven
<HeavyMetalPony> This would've been so fun to shoot
<Sneas> 03For me, my download speed is actually oky since I don't download alot of stuff, but for uploading... fuck. 20 KB/sec is like WTF
<PegacornBackup2> Dumb internet.
*ReticentSmolder The 'she' they're referring to, if you hadn't guessed, is the personification of lady liberty and the struggle to spread democracy to Vietnam

*ReticentSmolder A scene when Prudence locks herself in the closet and has to be serenaded out by the other cast members - is a reference to a real occurrence in 1968 at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India where The Beatles, Mia Farrow, Donovan, and others were studying.

*ReticentSmolder Mia Farrow's sister, Prudence, was reclusive and did not leave her living quarters to join the other students, inspiring John Lennon to write the song "Dear Prudence." The film also uses the song as a subtle reference to the fictional Prudence character's reluctance to 'come out of the closet' in relation to her sexual orientation.

*ReticentSmolder The subsequent scenes (excluding Max's) are a psychadelic look into the use of drugs and art during the early 70's. This scene is them at a rally against the war and advocating equal rights for Asians.

<HyperMetalLugia> :o
*ReticentSmolder Some scenes are derived from actual 1960s events, such as the violent student protest at Columbia University. The actual explosion at a New York townhouse was the work of the Weather Underground and took place at 18 West 11th Street in Greenwich Village; a photograph of the actual house appears in the movie.

*ReticentSmolder The painted bus and Dr. Robert (Bono) singing "I am the walrus" is a reference to psychedelic painted bus The Beatles had in their film Magical Mystery Tour, as well as Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters who traveled around the United States in his bus.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes

*ReticentSmolder During the number "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite", some of the text that appears in the background is taken directly from the vintage circus poster that inspired John Lennon to write the song.
<Caaz> Wait you live in Sweden?

<Asterisk> People there don't know the president.

<HeavyMetalPony> Yeah the adlib words don't help
<HaveTubaWillTravel> But an awesome one.
*ReticentSmolder During the underwater scene, Jude and Lucy pose alludes to John Lennon and Yoko Ono on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine Issue 335 (Jan. 22, 1981). They were photographed by Annie Leibovitz.
*Light_Latias 12eeps as she is revived, then flattened
<Caaz> It's common knowledge that half the people in america don't give a shit about the president.
*Silverscreen 11is a happy pony.
<Elky> maybe not the best question to ask
<Nittany_Tiger_> Or they are in The Matrix. Just the 1960s version.
<Skylands> 10Latias shaped pancakes
*HyperMetalLugia chucks a red fairy at LL
*ReticentSmolder "Because" is sung by exactly nine actors - a reference to the way The Beatles recorded the song - the 3-part harmony vocal performance among John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison is overdubbed three times to make nine voices in all.

<DragonRage> Strange but awesome movie is strange, but awesome.
<Light_Latias> 12he made me a lightcake
<Silverscreen> 11Indeed.
<Caaz> A lot of us figure "WE don't care, fix things", and nothing gets fixed. And then we complain some more, even though we really don't know what's to be fixed because no one can be bothered trying to read up on shit
<Maxaminus_1> Making out...underwater...in front of green screen.
<Silverscreen> 11or how about...
<Silverscreen> 11JUST FUCKING WEIRD?!
<Caaz> It's fun being an american, sometimes.
<ReticentSmolder> aaaaaaaaaaaaand suddenly Vietnam

<RobotPinkie> Beautiful movie is beautiful!
<DragonRage> War. War never changes.
<Silverscreen> 11WHAT IIIIS IT GOOD FOR?
<Elky> no, I think they really did it underwater
<Silverscreen> 11Aboslutely NOTHING!
<Elky> how would they get the hair right otherwise?
<Gnorri> DragonRage fallout reference?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> This movie would rock in 3D, Heavy.
<DragonRage> Eeyup.
<HeavyMetalPony> *rock
*Kosoveon bakes Light_Latias a cake...?

<HyperMetalLugia> Lies
<Asterisk> It is.
<Asterisk> People are dense
<Asterisk> Some rules need changed.
<Maxaminus_1> Oh yea, I agree, they were under water. And in front of a green screen.
<Kosoveon> sure why not
<Kosoveon> I could have done a pie
<Caaz> Stupidity is bliss, so if we do ever go down the drain it's gonna be fun.

<HaveTubaWillTravel> :D
<SirSprinkles> 6If this movie was in 3D, it would qualify as heavy drugs.
<Elky> true
<HyperMetalLugia> But Sky
<ReticentSmolder> lol SirSprinkles
<Caaz> I'm sure I've got something wrong there.
<Elky> but does a green screen even work underwater?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Maxaminus_1> Sure
<Silverscreen> 11the hospital scene was my favorite scene.
<RobotPinkie> Yes, Elky
<ReticentSmolder> @Elky if placed behind a tank
<Light_Latias> 12I've been flattened, left, caked...WHAT NAO?!
<HeavyMetalPony> yes, i saw it on a Harry Potter doc
<Maxaminus_1> <speaking from 2 years of professional compositing experience>
<Elky> wouldn't movement in the water disturb it?
<Maxaminus_1> naw
<HeavyMetalPony> just a green-screened tank
<Caaz> Ignorance is bliss... SAME THING.
<Elky> okay then
<Maxaminus_1> chromakey only cares about color
<ReticentSmolder> or that
<Caaz> I'ma just sit in the corner.
<Kosoveon> I'd offer cookies
<SirSprinkles> 6Elky, the movement of the water would just result in an actual water look for the greenscreen anyway... Oo
<ReticentSmolder> so what do you guys think of it so far?
<RobotPinkie> Also used in 300, The Eye 2, and many other movies.
<Kosoveon> but I'm afraid what the reaction would be o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd offer muffins
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<CaitSith> Me with a server in London: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1409817171.png
<RobotPinkie> Well, you already know what I think :3
<Maxaminus_1> You don't get distortion when you're fully immersed in water. Unless there are temperature gradients.
<Asterisk> Fucking die
<Sathi> i'm soooo gonna play beatles song tomorrow :P
<DragonRage> It's a pretty good movie.
<Asterisk> ):
<HeavyMetalPony> It's like Fantasia, some sequences far outweigh others
<Maxaminus_1> Now speaking as scuba diver.
<CaitSith> lol.
<Elky> dammit, why are y'all so smart?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Sounds like you've lead a pretty interesting life, Maxaminus.
<Light_Latias> 12the cookies will cause a chain reaction that makes everything...flowery
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<SilverSonic> http://radionintendo.com/downloadcast.php?castid=145 for those who missed the pokemon special
<Maxaminus_1> We got to take SCUBA in high school
<Maxaminus_1> it was neat
<ReticentSmolder> bwebs
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I stand corrected about high school being boring.
<DragonRage> I am so jelly, man.
<HeavyMetalPony> sweet, probably try scuba when I move to Florida
<CaitSith> In before everyone moves to Sweden.
*HyperMetalLugia dumps Skylands
<Caaz> I think the newest olympic event in 2012 is going to be pretty cool
<Kosoveon> too bad I don't have any dough-
<Asterisk> I will.
<DragonRage> The coolest thing I did in High School was take three and a half years of Electronics. =/
<Kosoveon> o_o
<Caaz> Anyone hear about it?
<HyperMetalLugia> erm...wait
<Kosoveon> ouch
<Asterisk> What is it
<Asterisk> VGcs?
<Caaz> "Outrun the apocalypse"
*HyperMetalLugia dumps flower on Skylands

<HyperMetalLugia> I'm cooking
*ReticentSmolder Lucy is joining an activist group of radicals who support socialism in the US as an extension of her hippy ideals from before.
<RobotPinkie> I think I know what my favorite song in this movie is, now...
<Ignaesia> I failed business studies in high school and now im an accountant
<HeavyMetalPony> Does A Day in the Life make it in? It's my favorite
<RobotPinkie> and it's not that far off!
<SirSprinkles> 6A lot of the other people at work love the beatles... I'm going to see how many of them I can get singing by the end of the day.
<Light_Latias> 12spelin iz ovuratid
<Kosoveon> he's making hippie cookies I guess

<WhatPayne> Sounds like McFly is about to be erased from history
<Light_Latias> 12more importantly
<Light_Latias> 12edible :B
<Light_Latias> 12it's grammur >:B
<Maxaminus_1> Fun electives aside, high school was pretty useless for me, and I was pretty useless for high school. College woke me up though.

<Pattyrick> Hi drf
<Light_Latias> 12ALLCAPS
<Elky> high school was okay as a pretty consequence-free place to get all the hormones out of the system
<Kosoveon> hypermetallugia is evil?
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Kosoveon> tell me something I don't know
*Kosoveon shot
<Pattyrick> no cps is meh

*ReticentSmolder dat Jack Daniels
<RobotPinkie> Guitar == emasculated

<Elky> jack daniels
<drf-Droid> hai LL
<Elky> this woman has poor taste
<drf-Droid> unlike you, when I'm with friends I don't ignore you :)
<ReticentSmolder> @Elky Janis Joplin chugged Southern Comfort
<Kosoveon> I guess then the chocolate chips he uses contain envy and pain :<
<RobotPinkie> get some LaPhroaig up in this bitch
<Nittany_Tiger_> High School was a popularity contest that I was happy ended.
<Maxaminus_1> At least it wasn't Captain Morgan. Or Smirnoff.
<Pattyrick> Mmmm chocolate chips
<Elky> I'm having southern comfort right now, it's too sweet for me
<HeavyMetalPony> I don't know if this is a bad thing, but so far my favorite part of the movie tribute to The Beatles is the tribute to Jimmi Hendrix
<Pattyrick> Ewwwww envy and paib
<Light_Latias> 12then Danny
<Caaz> Best case scenario, the world actually does end and I don't spend my last days worrying about fitting in.
<Light_Latias> 12you have boring friends
<Pattyrick> *pain
<SirSprinkles> 6Are you knockin' Smirnoff, Maxaminus?
<Maxaminus_1> Maybe :3
<drf-Droid> no
*ReticentSmolder When Jude takes inspiration from the bowl of strawberries, he creates a Jackson Pollock-styled "splatter" painting. This seemingly alludes to Stuart Sutcliffe, once a bassist with The Beatles, who was a painter in the Jackson Pollock style.
<drf-Droid> we watch movies
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Oh! THERE'S a joint!
<drf-Droid> and yay multitasking?

<Caaz> That could only happen if you become rich and I start mooching off of you.
<HeavyMetalPony> but it *was* free
<sotha> I have played both Portals, though I have yet to finish 2
<Glacymr> 12meow

<Light_Latias> 12rhyme
*ReticentSmolder Vietnam was unique in that it was the first war that was televised. It was described as 'war in the living room' and allowed unprecedented media exposure of what modern war looked like.
<RobotPinkie> I love both Portals, as does... everyone.

*ReticentSmolder By the way, I'm probably going to have to leave soon, bunch of friends of mine are going out to see Cowboy's and Aliens.
<SirSprinkles> 6The connection error is because veemi is down.

<Pattyrick> I'm pickin' up good vibrations, she's givin' me excitations
<Nittany_Tiger_> Deadly strawberries.
<sotha> I heard it did not do either genre complete justice, but is still fun by itself. Just don't expect it to be the best both genres have to offer alone or something like that.
<Skylands> 10wat
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to pick the right songs.

*Skylands faceplants
<sotha> basically
<Sneas> 03Keep my money in a safe at home though

<Kosoveon> *like
<RobotPinkie> otherwise, my TV is pretty boss
<sotha> I enjoyed the first because it did not take itself seriously at all. Just don't compare it to the books. You might be right about the sequel though.
<Pattyrick> And with the radio blastin' goes cruisin just as fast as she can now, and she'll have fun fun fun 'till tihe daddy takes the T-bird awaaayy
<HeavyMetalPony> Unless Brave comes out first, I'm following RobotPinkie's plan
<Elky> yep, the first movie was good but not sherlock holmes, but it loses with repeated watching
<prince-dari> .
<Light_Latias> 12oh gawd
<prince-dari> .
<prince-dari> .
<prince-dari> .
<Light_Latias> 12nice song, Kosovo o.o
*RobotPinkie brohoofs HeavyMetalPony
<sotha> Sotha only saw it once. That might be why.
<Elky> I'm afraid they won't have any good ideas for the sequel
<DragonRage> I'm actually planning on seeing that Tintin movie when it comes out, but other than that...
<Asterisk> I have like
<sotha> I forgot about Dark Knight Rises
<drf-Droid> LL
<Elky> Guy Ritchie's a good director though
<Asterisk> 10 two dollar bills
<drf-Droid> we might go back to my house XD
<sotha> which sounds like it could be about Nightmare Moon
<Pattyrick> I can recite the lyrics to waaaay too many songs
<Asterisk> Also I have $155.18 in the bank.
<CaitSith> I have like... No cash at all.
<HeavyMetalPony> Forgot about Tintin, ehh I'll wait for DVD
*Light_Latias 12randomly reminded of Dayo
<HeavyMetalPony> sorry Jackson
<Light_Latias> 12kay Danny :3
<HeavyMetalPony> & Spielberg
<Sathi> making a snack brb
<RobotPinkie> Jackson?
<sotha> I have honestly not once heard of Tintin.
<Elky> but as far as sequels go, I look forward to Machete Kills
<Nittany_Tiger_> Is Morgan Freeman going to be in the 3rd Batmam movie, or is his character done?
<RobotPinkie> as in Peter?
<Elky> and Sin City 2
<HeavyMetalPony> yep

<Nittany_Tiger_> So many sequels.
<Ziltoid> I think hes done
<DragonRage> The only reason I knew there was going to be a Tintin movie was the fine folks at NPF.
<RobotPinkie> Well, definitely going to have to see it at some point, then.
<HeavyMetalPony> Freeman is under contract for 3 batman films, so probably
<RobotPinkie> lol I just found out

<Caaz> Evil genius he is.
<Asterisk> He pirated the Internet

<Light_Latias> 12all songs too low for me :3
<RobotPinkie> It's actually 27 x 22, it comes out as 2722 due to a formatting error.
<Asterisk> Totally guessed
<RobotPinkie> really good ship
<Light_Latias> 12WAY so XD
<Elky> 2722 is obviously the number of times 'The Great and Powerful Trixie' is gonna be said in S2
<Caaz> I can see the spectrum of light through windows...
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU
<HeavyMetalPony> :( Hoping for more Across the Universe
<Caaz> I think I might be tripping
<sotha> really robotpinkie?
<Aeroslash> hi Pat
<HeavyMetalPony> Elky: per episode
<RobotPinkie> no, not really
<Sneas> 03:O
<RobotPinkie> :3
<Elky> heh
<Pattyrick> Gah, brb shower
<Articuno> 12does anyonme know where I can get animated soul silver/hg spirtes?
<sotha> Someone needs to write 27X22 shipping fic now.
<Pattyrick> And low idrfhatesthis is low
<Caaz> either that or I've been listening to way too much dubstep and shit and it's finally starting to get to me.
<SirSprinkles> 6This movie has some hellish mood swings.
<Asterisk> Dude
<Asterisk> You're the One.
<HeavyMetalPony> So do The Beatles' music
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it does feel a bit.... helter skelter
<RobotPinkie> *puts on sunglasses slightly too late*
<HeavyMetalPony> oh snap
<Hipster_Brony> 8YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH
<Elky> hipster out of fucking nowhere
<RobotPinkie> Haha, awesome
<Caaz> I'm just sorta sitting on my bed, staring at lights with a goofy smile. If I'm the one, this universe is fucking DOOMED.
<Nittany_Tiger_> 27 and 22 meet up and create 594. The end.
<HeavyMetalPony> I take back my earlier statement wanting more Across the Universe
<DragonRage> Hiya, Hipster!
<Nittany_Tiger_> I can make it better if you want.
<Caaz> Maybe there's something in the water
<HeavyMetalPony> oh hey Hipster, you scared me
<RobotPinkie> but really awesome song is coming up
<Nittany_Tiger_> Sexy multiplication.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ive been here this whole time

<HeavyMetalPony> *you're
<Elky> kinda like a shark
<Sathi> back
<Caaz> Although I don't think I have tits.
<Caaz> Should work on that.
<sotha> Sharks are so mainstream
<HeavyMetalPony> Are people who liek sharks also mainstream?
<HeavyMetalPony> *like
<Elky> eh, Jaws was full of hot air anyway
<Dashite> Jaws was full of compressed air.
<HeavyMetalPony> Jaws was full of explosive meat, liek a real shark
<sotha> wow

<HeavyMetalPony> youtube comments on this are so disappointing
<RobotPinkie> Pneumatic shark killed the chat
<Elky> on what?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> When are youtube comments not dissapointing?
<DragonRage> THey can't all be winners.
<DragonRage> And in youtube commentary's cases, they usually aren't.
<HeavyMetalPony> But is originality really that hard. Even if you fail at least you try.
<Nittany_Tiger_> "Thumbs up because I'm a thumbs-up whore."
<HaveTubaWillTravel> THIS, HeavyMetalPony
<Elky> these kind of comments are worse than 'first!'
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah
<CaitSith> Just a note: I'm currently stealing all of your bandwidth.
<HeavyMetalPony> "Reverse psychology for thumbs because Imma whore."
<DragonRage> n people were y, where n is the number of dislikes the video has and y is something tangentially related to the video.
<HeavyMetalPony> imma just quote a joke from 8 minutes into the video that will ruin it for everybody else
<Nittany_Tiger_> "<# of dislikes> people are <dislike related to comment>"
<HeavyMetalPony> 1) inject midget navi into penis
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Or if it's a TV show, point out a plot whole that completely spoils a particular plot point.
<HeavyMetalPony> 2)...
<Elky> We should all be rad.
<HeavyMetalPony> 3) profit
<HaveTubaWillTravel> *hole
<Nittany_Tiger_> Lol HeavyMetalPony
<HeavyMetalPony> tuba: oh yeah
<Nittany_Tiger_> The only two I used to have trouble standing were thumbs-up whore comments and dislike comments.
<Nittany_Tiger_> They were lame spam than ruined the videos for me.
<RobotPinkie> I really like how this refers back to last time she talked to Jude.
<HeavyMetalPony> movie's almost over. Where is favorite song?
<Asterisk> Get out
<CaitSith> :(
<Caaz> What we do is we force Cait to host all the servers ever.

<Pattyrick> You use the GHOST command
<DragonRage> ... I can hear thunder outside. I don't know whether to feel awesome about this, or worried.
<SirSprinkles> 6I love Hey Jude.
<HeavyMetalPony> Only because you could really make this film with any band just by changing some details
<Pattyrick> d'oh

<RobotPinkie> depends on where you live
<Glacymr> 12;-;

<Aeroslash> !Kosoveon
<DragonRage> I love rain, but the last time it rained I lost my internet access.
<Pattyrick> !Aeroslash
<DragonRage> Where I live, it doesn't rain much. It makes me miss Wisconsin.
<Pattyrick> FAIL
<Nittany_Tiger_> I /want/ to live in Tornado Alley for the tornadoes.

<HeavyMetalPony> Why doesn't Hollywood just make band movies like this from now On? It's much better than freaking remakes, and I'd probably see them all
<Elky> and in winter, we have unholy amounts of snow
<DragonRage> It sounds heavenly there, Elky.

<CaitSith> Told you it was a turd with cables connected to it.
<RobotPinkie> me neither
<Elky> just waiting til they get shown on synchtube or bmn gets the job done too
<Kosoveon> and the fact the octopus can jump
<Kosoveon> just seals the deal
*Light_Latias 12prefers Mr. G&Ws Keyblade :3
<HeavyMetalPony> Chances are if I liek the song I'll like the PMV, that's what I look for
<Kosoveon> ray can agree with me here

*Kosoveon prefers his torch move
<Ray> 02SO HOT

<Ray> 02Taking otherone's job
<RobotPinkie> bai gnorri
<Ray> 02|D
<Maxaminus_1> He was in the navy right? They could have made Yellow Submarine work.
<HeavyMetalPony> I'd add another song to list of disappoint, but text would be three paragraphs long
<HaveTubaWillTravel> ...point, Maxaminus
<Combustiblelemons> hi all
<Elky> hiya lemons
<DragonRage> Hiya, lemons.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> LOL at all or most of the songs having the same writer credits.
<Ray> 02other one's*
<Light_Latias> 12as opposed to the enemy got burned?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And hi Combustiblelemons. You wouldn't believe what you just missed. Unless you saw it last night
<HeavyMetalPony> Then again if you really wanted to do Beatles justice the film owuld have to be 7 hours
<Combustiblelemons> I saw it
<Hipster_Brony> back
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Thank god :D
<Combustiblelemons> Funniest night ever
<Light_Latias> 12yay lateness :D
<HeavyMetalPony> Was Friday's better than today's
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And I had to miss it because Veemi hated me last night >.>
<Ray> 02However
<prince-dari> Veemi has exploded today.
<Combustiblelemons> yeah. also streams not working for me T_T
<prince-dari> The site's down. :/
<HeavyMetalPony> Veemi was frozen today
<Combustiblelemons> ahh ok
<Ray> 02The G&W's FS is easy to deal with
<RobotPinkie> This is what you missed last night: http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/9125550.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6btw, guys, the Home page has been updated with next weeks lineup.
<WhatPayne> Curious because to me it's working just fine...
<RobotPinkie> aw, didn't work
<Ray> 02You only need how to "border play"
<Kosoveon> orly
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That was fast. Good job, Sprinkles.
<Kosoveon> one problem
<HeavyMetalPony> cool, will check
<Light_Latias> 12doesn't always work
<SirSprinkles> 6I did it earlier, Tuba.
<Kosoveon> if you are willing to kamikaze yourself
<Light_Latias> 12edge guarding
<Light_Latias> 12:B
<Kosoveon> you're BOUND to be able to kill someone with that move :>
<SirSprinkles> 6I had the code written out for it since yesterday.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> So you did it even faster. :O
<Kosoveon> especially since the octopus can jump
<Ray> 02Edge guarding can be dealed with Block abuse
<Aeroslash> that just fascinates you, doesn't it, Kos?
<Aeroslash> that an octopus can jump
<Aeroslash> Octillery can jump and you ignore it =(
<DragonRage> The storm's getting closer, I think. Just heard a loud thundercrack.
<DragonRage> <3
<Combustiblelemons> oooh. I love storms too
<Pattyrick> what if I suddenly became an Octillery?
<drf-Droid> holy crap
<Ziltoid> hello?
<drf-Droid> I'm at dinner, right
<drf-Droid> and guess who I saw
<Elky> storms are cool
<Elky> hi?
<Combustiblelemons> ohai ziltoid
<Veewave> All I'm getting is "internet explorer cannot display the webpage" for the video.
<Pattyrick> Peter Griffin?
<drf-Droid> no
<Kosoveon> wait what
<junh1024-XD> your mom ?
<Pattyrick> Hugh Hefner?
<drf-Droid> my high school band director
<DragonRage> Also, is it just me, or does this PMV make Applejack seem a lot more badass than she usually is on the show?
<Ziltoid> my stream is derped
<Nittany_Tiger> Do you live in the US DragonRage?
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drf-Droid> I was like :O
<HyperMetalLugia> Spongebob?
<Combustiblelemons> yes we all have it. streams crashed
<DragonRage> Yeah.
<Elky> implying Applejack isn't always badass
<SirSprinkles> 6Veewave, it's because veemi is having an issue.
<HeavyMetalPony> Aw well, still no luck with stream. Better luck next week.
<Pattyrick> OMG SPONGEBOB!!
<DragonRage> West coast, on the edge of the Mojave.
<Ziltoid> oh ok
<Combustiblelemons> meh AJ is boring.
<SirSprinkles> 6All of veemi is down.
*Pattyrick dies thinking of Krabby Patties
<Aeroslash> Squidward?
<junh1024-XD> Tamagotchi!
<Elky> NO U
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<Kosoveon> well I can jump but you never acknowledge it :(
<Pattyrick> Pierce Brosnin?
<Kosoveon> so ther
<Kosoveon> e
<RobotPinkie> aw, I love AJ
<HeavyMetalPony> Then how come some people are watching?
<Aeroslash> I can jump too, Kos!
<drf-Droid> but I don't feel like saying hi o.o
<RobotPinkie> ...and all ponies
<Ziltoid> AJ is alright
<Combustiblelemons> She's nice and all but she's boring.
<Light_Latias> 12Danny D:
<Elky> some people didn't refesh their streams
<Light_Latias> 12how wude
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Elky> dumb luck really
<Kosoveon> you're a big kid now :B
*Kosoveon shot
<Veewave> That is very unfortunate.
<Nittany_Tiger> State?
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Elky> dat script
<Light_Latias> 12he's a man
<SirSprinkles> 6Heavy, it's only working for people that haven't refreshed and have been here for a while.
<Aeroslash> you are too, Kos :>
<DragonRage> California.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or are you looking at the weather radar?
<RobotPinkie> The way she rounded up those vicious bunnies
*Light_Latias 12made sure of tha-nvm
<RobotPinkie> that was badass
*Light_Latias 12shot
<drf-Droid> LL, well
<SirSprinkles> 6Why it's working for them, I have no clue.
<DragonRage> I'm sitting with my window open.
<drf-Droid> I'm shy
<SirSprinkles> 6But all of veemi is down.
<Pattyrick> I'm still a medium-kid
<drf-Droid> surely you can't understand
<HyperMetalLugia> Medium-rare?
<Combustiblelemons> strange.
<Light_Latias> 12I can
<Pattyrick> I understand what you mean, drf
<Maxaminus_1> They didn't develop the ponie's personalities based on their elements much past the pilot.
<HeavyMetalPony> OK, anyway I guess I'll go then. Can't wait for Inception...and tomatoes
<Light_Latias> 12only too well .-.
<Pattyrick> I can sometimes be a lil' shy IRL
<Chimera> 04XD
<Elky> I don't think another pony can claim to have saved all of ponyville from being trampled y cows
<Chimera> 04LL
<drf-Droid> inb4 but that's no excuse
<drf-Droid> hi Chimera
<Chimera> 04You so funny
<Pattyrick> hi Chimera
<DragonRage> Okay, the storm is definitely closer. I can hear the rain. Oh gods, that rain...
<Maxaminus_1> Which I thought was a little unfortunate.
<Chimera> 04hi
<Combustiblelemons> well RD is still loyal to her friends I guess max
<RobotPinkie> Well I've refreshed the stream quite recently, but not the page.
<SirSprinkles> 6So... rules revision time guys?
<Kosoveon> !chimera
*Chimera now belongs to Kosoveon for 7 minutes
<Maxaminus_1> Yep
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to see the storm on radar.
<Combustiblelemons> loyalty is an easy one though
<Ziltoid> so what now?
<Maxaminus_1> But I would really like to see Rarity's element explored.
<Elky> loyal to her friends? Dragonshy begs to differ
<Nittany_Tiger> Calfornia has a ton of doppler radars.
<Pattyrick> brb
<RobotPinkie> screw friends, she got the ticket
<Combustiblelemons> She's still badass.
<Combustiblelemons> Any problems with this? no? ok
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess for terrain purposes.

<Ray> 02something
<Ray> 02.-.
<Aeroslash> gay?
<DragonRage> I was here for some of last night. Internet crapped out twice though, so I missed most of both movies and of Winter Wrap Up.
<Aeroslash> but the f-word version?
<RobotPinkie> http://memegenerator.net/instance/9125550
<RobotPinkie> best part
<Ray> 02lolno
<Nittany_Tiger> I was here for everything but didn't watch Across the Universe.
<Aeroslash> oh
<Ray> 02just ghey
<Nittany_Tiger> I underestimated the movie.
<Ray> 02.-.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Nope. I was here, but I might as well not have been. When the stream was working, the chat wasn't, and vice versa... it was awful.
<Aeroslash> it didn't kick me though o.o
<Ray> 02Which is weeeird how it kicked me.
<Ray> 02and didn't kick you ._.
<Combustiblelemons> I didn't want to watch across the universe
<drf-Droid> o.o
<drf-Droid> well

<RobotPinkie> Yeah, epic pre-show

<Elky> it was good lemons
<drf-Droid> it's like saying pissed, you won't get kicked :P
<Chimera> 04Invader Zim
<Ray> 02lolno.

<Ray> 02oh I see
<HyperMetalLugia> Zimberg
<Ray> 02So yeah
<Chimera> 04Blah Dib is so stupid
<Combustiblelemons> lol I made that one robotpinkie
<DragonRage> All right, DragonRage went and googled weather maps and such.

<Ray> 02wheee. I'm a bad person now :<
<Chimera> 04He should screen record the live feed from Marz
<DragonRage> This is the closest area I could find on this one site's list.
<RobotPinkie> That one's the best
<Chimera> 04Mars
<DragonRage> http://www.weathercentral.com/weather/us/cities/ca_big_bear_lake.html

<Kosoveon> you're just a terrible person
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
*Kosoveon runs
*HyperMetalLugia blinks
*Ray goes to a emo corner
<Aeroslash> I've been kicked for swearing too, Ray
*Ray cries
<Light_Latias> 12yes yes you arfe
<Maxaminus_1> The ponies/beatles PMV would be pretty appropriate right now.
<Aeroslash> a long time ago
<Light_Latias> 12-f
<Nittany_Tiger> One sec.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> I have an awesome radar program.
<Light_Latias> 12I haven't~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Light_Latias 12hides
<DragonRage> San Bernardino.
<drf-Droid> how hard is it to just not swear, seriously >_>
<Light_Latias> 12ikr?
<Hipster_Brony> most important thing we need to add is a "the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit and make changes to the rules as the situation may warrant" disclaimer
<Aeroslash> how hard is it not to talk suggestively seriously >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> Swearing is boring
<Chimera> 04XD
<Ray> 02But I didn't :<
<Chimera> 04Not hard at all
<DragonRage> Oh hey, that's actually in the list. Didn't even see it.
<drf-Droid> ^
<Light_Latias> 12pretty easy, Slash :3
<drf-Droid> it's not hard
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
<DragonRage> http://www.weathercentral.com/weather/us/cities/ca_san_bernardino.html
<Sathi> hmm yes that's a good one
<drf-Droid> if you compare everything I say
<drf-Droid> that's like less than 5%
<drf-Droid> :P
<Aeroslash> mhm, I'm sure
<Light_Latias> 12because half of what you say is "LOL" in allcaps :3
*Light_Latias 12hides
<drf-Droid> I'm serious -_-
<RobotPinkie> yay white stripes
<Ray> 02xD
<drf-Droid> LL
<drf-Droid> LOL is an abbreviation
<Light_Latias> 12I'm not :D
<RobotPinkie> too bad it cuts off so quickly
<drf-Droid> so I capitalize it
<drf-Droid> yay proper grammar?
<MrPoniator> SECREYT BUTTFUN
*Light_Latias 12points to her last line
<Kosoveon> LOL -O = LL
<MrPoniator> Sorry, I just came to say that
<Kosoveon> coincidence?
<Kosoveon> I think not
<Aeroslash> XD
*Kosoveon shot

<Light_Latias> 12yup

<Light_Latias> 12don't insult the adverb ;-;
<Light_Latias> 12you'll hurt its feelings...
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> loudly is proper grammar
<Aeroslash> Arrow Aero? Is that not a coincidence too how they sound similar, Kos?
<drf-Droid> laughing loud isn't
<Hipster_Brony> hmmm
<Kosoveon> well LL if you want I'll try not to insult the baby carrots in the fridge by not eating them :<
<DragonRage> Quiet chat is quiet.

<Nittany_Tiger> It's that thunderstorm.
<SirSprinkles> 6I swear I said something... >>;
<drf-Droid> stupid saganaki
<Nittany_Tiger> In 3D.
<DragonRage> Ah.

<DragonRage> That's pretty cool.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Combustiblelemons> are you a stormchaser then or something or just into meteorology?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a storm chaser and a meteo grad student.

<Ray> 02Netherlands is the Country, Holland is like a state or something; not really sure .-.
<Ray> 02and yes. I'm at holland
<Elky> I still think inception is kind of a poor choice
<drf-Droid> ...
<drf-Droid> Holland is just another name for NL
<drf-Droid> they're synonyms
<SirSprinkles> 6Well that's just like, your opinion, pony.

<Combustiblelemons> My friend says watch it twice to understand it
<Elky> well the movie's good
<Pattyrick> back
<Combustiblelemons> So I can thanks to this :D
*Ray googles it
<Elky> but it's like choosing pirates of the carribean or something
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, because everyone seems to miss a kind of major plot point.
<Aeroslash> did you know that the Netherlands are the biggest coffee drinkers on the planet?
<Kosoveon> holland is the western part of the NL
<Aeroslash> they average in 5 cups a person per day
<Kosoveon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland
<Articuno> 12I thought Holland was no longer the name for it
<Maxaminus_1> Yeah, fridays are out for me too, I need to start spending friday nights with my stupid little drinking buddies again.
<SirSprinkles> 6Elky... you do realize that that statement just was one of the dumbest things I've ever herd, don't you?
<Ray> 02It isn't the same thing drf
<Ray> 02http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080316180819AAGsRVv
<Articuno> 12hmm I see
<Combustiblelemons> I'm good at picking up plots to stories. Best I don't read the chat whilst I watch it thouhj
<Pattyrick> I thought that was Seattle...
<Elky> I didn't really have a good movie to compare it to
*Pattyrick runs
<RobotPinkie> For me it's more that studies are starting up again. :3
<Articuno> 12I always thought they were the same, but that Holland was the old name for it
<Elky> I was gonna say dark knight, but that's by christopher nolan too...
<SirSprinkles> 6"People will pick movies they think are good for the good movie of the week"
<drf-Droid> same Arti
<Elky> no, people will pick movies everybody's already seen
<Combustiblelemons> Still, nothing can possible suck as badly as spider's web.
<RobotPinkie> The B-movies are also good!
<drf-Droid> now brb dinner
<SirSprinkles> 6EEEEEEEEEEEENOPE
<Ray> 02lol, where is Shiny where you need him
<SirSprinkles> 6This week is proof of that, Elky.
<Dashite> Elky, as opposed to Aladdin and Mulan?
<Combustiblelemons> Spider's web robotpinkie... D:
<SirSprinkles> 6NOPONY had even HERD of Across the Universe.
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<RobotPinkie> I mean attack of the killer tomatoes? Pure gold.
<Elky> tbh, I've seen neither of those
<Ray> 02he should be nickalerted when someone says coffe--
<Maxaminus_1> I'm waiting for the day that Scootaloo rips off that handle and starts practicing her kickflips.
<Ray> 02well he's not here. xD
<Dashite> I've heard of Across the Universe. :/
<Elky> sprinkles: which is why I prefer weeks like this one
<DragonRage> Pink Pony!
<Maxaminus_1> We need more skater chicks.
<Kosoveon> timing
<Kosoveon> XDDD
<DragonRage> I love this skit.
<Hipster_Brony> in any case
<RobotPinkie> best pony :3
<DragonRage> This should actually be a thing.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, Elky, it's called mixing it up.
<Combustiblelemons> I haven't heard of it but sounds like a good b movie
<Dashite> Elky, you've never seen either of those? How?!
<Elky> but yeah, you're right, it is just my opinion, man
<Haseo> [06:24:19 pm] 11(CaitSith11) [00:09:07] <Asterisk> Specs <--- http://i1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd513/Daimoify/Random/DSC00029.jpg <- AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> My movie choice is going to be My Little Pony: The Movie
<SirSprinkles> 6We'd get to the big movies at some point anyway.
<prince-dari> U mad viewers?
<CaitSith> lol
<Combustiblelemons> D: oh god
<Hipster_Brony> lets discuss what things we definitely want to change for the rules so i can put it in the rough draft
<MrPoniator> !
<RobotPinkie> No idea what spider's web is... I guess it's good that I missed it?
<ClockworkPie> Yes Dari
<DragonRage> Eh, why not, dari?
<Sathi> 7eeeyup
<Elky> my childhood was largely disney-free
<prince-dari> RobotPinkie: No, you missed out. :(
<Dashite> Dari, I will find something that even you won't be able to stand.
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. End of Summer Special being LotR. Stuff like that will eventually be shown.
<RobotPinkie> Come at me, bro!
<DragonRage> We're gonna have to see it one of these days.
<Maxaminus_1> I have a buddy who refuses to watch G4 but swears that he loved MLP the movie when he was a kid.
<RobotPinkie> aw :(
<Combustiblelemons> be happy you missed it robotpinkie
<Polarfire> ohai dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Polarfire> :3
<Combustiblelemons> I'd rather read 100 badfics than see that again
<prince-dari> Is that so...?
<Elky> you should definitely watch it robot
<DragonRage> Missing Spider's Web is pretty much the best way to see it.
<prince-dari> ...>_>
<RobotPinkie> oh god it stars Stephen Baldwin? that sounds hilarious
*Ray yanws again
<Elky> it's forming character
<prince-dari> Why all the Spider's Web hate?
<prince-dari> I love that film.
<Ray> 02I'm geeeetting sleeepy
<DragonRage> ...
<DragonRage> Wait.
<MrPoniator> Combustiblelemons, I'm compelled to write those 100 fics and make them utterly horrible
<Ray> 02But I refuse to sleeeeeep
<CaitSith> Haseo, here's something for you to laugh at: http://speedtest.net/result/1409809525.png
<SirSprinkles> 6Need something about spoilers, IMO
<DragonRage> Sorry, wrong movie.
<DragonRage> I think.
<DragonRage> I don't know.
<DragonRage> Dari.
<DragonRage> Are you thinking Charlotte's Web?
<Ray> 02Because sleep is for the weeeeak
<prince-dari> EeeeeeeeeeeeNOPE.
<DragonRage> Because that's awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> ill put in something about being respectful
<prince-dari> I restreamed Spider's Web because I missed it.
<Elky> spider's web is a bad ripoff
<Maxaminus_1> What would your perfect movie / episode lineup be?
<Hipster_Brony> and specifically mention spoilering
<Combustiblelemons> I don't want to see anything to do with pigs after that episode
<prince-dari> Was an awesome film. :P
<Kosoveon> no it's not
<Combustiblelemons> *film
<Ray> 02a Wild Country has appeared :O
<Haseo> I've seen better.
<Kosoveon> it means your body doesn't want you to melt
<Kosoveon> :(
<Kosoveon> wild country fled
<Haseo> A lot better.
<Caaz> I've seen way better, but it still feels me with rage
<SirSprinkles> 6Something about links other than image links
<Kosoveon> you gained: 0 EXP
<Sathi> 7err..
<RobotPinkie> At least I'll be here for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, that's gonna be awesome.
<Ray> 02:<
<Hipster_Brony> ah yes
<Haseo> It feels you, eh?
<Hipster_Brony> definitely
<CaitSith> Yes. Seen. But do you have that kind of speed yourself?
<Caaz> Feels me in the wrong way that is.
<Sathi> 7never seen it
<Ziltoid> spider web is fucking garbage anyone that says otherwise is lock in the coco
<Combustiblelemons> I'm hoping hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for the next A film.
<DragonRage> 8-Bit Winter Wrap Up.
<Haseo> The question is do I care to.
<Elky> spider's web was more enjoyable than the room
<DragonRage> Perfect credits song.
*Ray sits on Kosveon's head and go--
<Ray> 02No.
<Elky> so there's that
<Combustiblelemons> the room was awesome
<Ray> 02I won't >-<
<Kosoveon> o-o
<Kosoveon> go--
<Ray> 02Must not sleep.
<prince-dari> Elky: What a story Mark.
<Maxaminus_1> I'd like to see Aliens for A movie, Krull for B movie, Applebuck season, and Suited for Success.
<Sathi> also something about caps locks.. imho it's annoying
<RobotPinkie> lol so you have had The Room for BMN?
<Kosoveon> what time is it there XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Ziltoid, that's just like, your opinion, pony.
<SirSprinkles> 6Robot, yes.
<Elky> I dunno, the chat really improved Spider's Web, but The Room... not so much
<RobotPinkie> Now that I'm genuinely sad to have missed.
<Combustiblelemons> suited for success is on next week
<Maxaminus_1> sweet
<Elky> max: exactly my episode choices
<Combustiblelemons> I picked best night ever for the other pony ep :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Just a sec, I'll pull up the list of past movie nights.
<Combustiblelemons> underrated imo.
<RobotPinkie> I will feel incredibly sad at what I've missed
<Caaz> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9305622/tmp/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%203.56.13%20PM.png
<Caaz> This torrent is full of lame.
<DragonRage> Jumping Lyra <3
<Elky> sprinkles: could you put the list on the site?
<Combustiblelemons> you were there for DCD's show though weren't you?
<Hipster_Brony> ill mention it in the respect section
<CaitSith> lololol.
<Maxaminus_1> omg I just saw next weeks movie lineup. I love you guys.
<Elky> sometimes I wonder what movies went together, so it'd be handy
<prince-dari> Elky: What, a sort of history section?
<Ray> 021am
<Hipster_Brony> but thats borderline unenforceable
<prince-dari> To show what we've streamed before.
<Elky> yup
<SirSprinkles> 6I plan to at some point.
<Combustiblelemons> what was the best BMN?
<Elky> great
<prince-dari> Meh, we could pretty much just paste the tables?
<prince-dari> With all the films.
<Kosoveon> not that bad
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay, not too much I'm all that sad to have missed. :P
<Kosoveon> some people here stay up till 4AM ;;P
<SirSprinkles> 6I was going to do the tables with all the films, actually.
<Kosoveon> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 8 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
<RobotPinkie> Death stalker, definitely sad to have missed
<Maxaminus_1> Aw I'm sad I missed the Super Mario Bros movie
<Elky> for example, what a mive went with Deathstalker 2?
<SirSprinkles> 6I already know what I'm going to do for it.
<Ray> 02I could
<Ziltoid> The big lebowski now that is agreat movie
<Ray> 02buuuut'
<prince-dari> MFW I should have kept all the tables, but just replaced them.
<SirSprinkles> 6Up! was with DS2
<Ray> 02I woke up at 5am
<Elky> oh
<Combustiblelemons> D: dari
<SirSprinkles> 6I kept them all.
<Ray> 02thank you timezones
<Sathi> also true
<prince-dari> Oh, nice.
<SirSprinkles> 6I keep records of EVERYTHING.
<RobotPinkie> and well, Disney movies
<Elky> so that definitely is up there for best movie night
<DragonRage> Man, we saw Up! and DS2 near the start of July?
<prince-dari> Best movie night was Evil Dead 2.
<Maxaminus_1> The movie that went with Deathstalker II was Up
<DragonRage> It feels like it was just last week. =/
<prince-dari> I didn't really like Up.
<prince-dari> Other than the PILLS!
<prince-dari> PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, next one sounds like it'll be awesome
<Combustiblelemons> I wonder if DCD is going to get sprinkles to do an embarassing pre-show in revenge one day....
<Sneas> 03o..o
<Pattyrick> :|
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Elky> mfw I can barely read anything
<RobotPinkie> haha
<SirSprinkles> 6He'd have to have reason for revenge, first.
<prince-dari> I don't think Sprinkles has a webcam?
<SirSprinkles> 6He was supposed to stream yesterday, not me.
<Elky> yes, definitely Up/DS2
<Elky> also, lol at eqd
<prince-dari> Also, my scripts works fine now, suck it viewers.
<Combustiblelemons> ahh ok
<Sathi> 7Luna won
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 script fails
<Maxaminus_1> "I'll get my revenge, and Deathstalker two."
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<RobotPinkie> Oh god these ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, you should change the color
<RobotPinkie> they drive me to socks
<prince-dari> To?
<Combustiblelemons> I kinda saw that coming really.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, the background color of it.
<Elky> max: the only clever line in the entire movie
<SirSprinkles> 6Make it all light blue on dark blue or something.
<Combustiblelemons> light blue.
<Kosoveon> |:
<DragonRage> Anyhow, I've got a fanfic to write and some Dragon Nest to play, so ciao everyone.

<RobotPinkie> Luna getting a lot of love for her socks
<Pattyrick> I knew that'd come up xD
<prince-dari> Wall-fix vision!
<Combustiblelemons> I want to watch a 60s spiderman episode for a preshow thing one day :P
<Elky> We watched a spiderman ep once, but I guess a newer one?
<Combustiblelemons> yeah a newer one :/
<RainBroDash> 2722
<prince-dari> ^ no
<prince-dari> :P
<SoiPony> 2722?
<Elky> and I calculated how fast Spiderman's webs were
<RainBroDash> 12New RBD Post: 2722
<prince-dari> XD
<SoiPony> lol
<Elky> great post RBD
<drf-Droid> Pattyrick, I can show you the wi-fi adapter I have when I get home in like 10 minutes
*RainBroDash 10bows to Elky
<RobotPinkie> awesomepost
<Combustiblelemons> *applauds RBD*
<WhatPayne> sweet song
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Elky> bah, the original is better
<prince-dari> Going to watch newest Torchwood episode.
<prince-dari> BBL
<WhatPayne> marginally better
<RobotPinkie> yay Torchwood!
<Combustiblelemons> Gonna put on some brony music I think
<RobotPinkie> have fun, dari
<Elky> see ya dari
<Sathi> Also.. where's the rest of the team?
<SirSprinkles> 6No idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, the only one that's not really here is Ghosties.
<Combustiblelemons> I found pokemon leafgreen when I was looking under my bed today :D
<SirSprinkles> 6dari and RainBro are in the mane chat.
<Sathi> Dari is afk now
<RainBroDash> rbd is here
<Sathi> he's watching Torchwood
<RainBroDash> sorry I was making some crumpets
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, is there even really anything we still need to cover?
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<SirSprinkles> 6For the moment anyway?
<Elky> uh, okay...
*RainBroDash 10is eating toasted crumpets. So he wins.
<SirSprinkles> 6Until the rough draft is written up...
<RobotPinkie> all I need is my Pokemon Emerald, though
<Combustiblelemons> I found that too :D
<RainBroDash> well the thing I'd like to focus on mostly is wording
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<RobotPinkie> Crumpets? Chat just turned 1/5th more British
<Combustiblelemons> Emerald has a stronger story but it takes forever to skip all the talking...
<Elky> I don't want to know what other stuff is hidden under your bed...
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that can be worked out after the draft is written.
<RainBroDash> 10robotpinkie. Shall I get a pot of tea on the stove?
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, I guess that's true
<Pattyrick> Whut movie, I wonder...?
<Combustiblelemons> Awesome stuff elky. awesome stuff.
<Elky> I say.
<Skylands|Movie> 10Sucker Punch
<RobotPinkie> Way ahead of you, RainBroDash
<Combustiblelemons> quite.
<RainBroDash> 10RobotPinkie <3
<RobotPinkie> Earl Grey
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai :)
<RainBroDash> 10I was thinking breakfast tea
<Combustiblelemons> oh yes could I have some scones too?
<RainBroDash> 10but earl grey will do
<RobotPinkie> I might not be British, but I'm a bit of a britophile or something :>
<Kosoveon> I actually thought that was a good movie
<Kosoveon> despite all the negative reviews
<Sneas> 03oooo.oooo
<Combustiblelemons> Ohai I'm british.
<Elky> mfw all I know about how Brits speak I learned from Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged Series
<Kosoveon> really good soundtrack too
<RainBroDash> exactly, so i don't really have much to contribute beforehand
<RainBroDash> :3
*Pattyrick wonders how it is
<Combustiblelemons> ehh close enough elky
<RobotPinkie> I should go to London more often, it's not really too expensive nowadays.
<Elky> probably not the best guide
<Pattyrick> It looked ok, but not the kind of thing I'd go and watch by myself
<Sathi> 7RobotPinkie: is from?
<RobotPinkie> I'm from Sweden
<RobotPinkie> if that was the question
<Combustiblelemons> Only been to london 2 times in my life and I live in britain >.>
<Combustiblelemons> embarrassing.
<Hipster_Brony> im almost done eating, so ill get to work on it shortly
<Sathi> 7Yes that was the question
<Elky> why would it be cheaper robot?
<Asterisk> Sneas y u so WV
<Kosoveon> well it is definitely a dumb movie
<RobotPinkie> but I'm half dutch, so that makes up for it :3
<Sneas> 03wut
<Sneas> 03XD
<Kosoveon> but the good kind of dumb, not the transformers 2 kind of dumb
<Combustiblelemons> I'm wondering that too elky... Everything here is just rising in price
<Pattyrick> xD
<RobotPinkie> Flying is cheaper now than when I last went.
<RobotPinkie> It's been a loooooong time
<Elky> hm
<WhatPayne> Ya'll talking about where you're from?
<Combustiblelemons> oh ok
<Pattyrick> all the new Transformers movies = explosions
*Sathi 7is a half dutchy aswell
<Sathi> 7US/NL interesting combo :)
<RobotPinkie> Oooh
<Kosoveon> that and really, really, really dumb humor
<RobotPinkie> Next you'll be telling me you live in PA
<Kosoveon> which was really got me to not like TF2 aside everything else
<Sathi> 7Nah I live in the Netherlands now,but got raised in the USA
<Nittany_Tiger> I live in PA.
<RobotPinkie> Oh cool
<Kosoveon> I mean the first had its moments but it was never to the same extent
<Hipster_Brony> 8>mfw 2 of the mods live in PA
<RobotPinkie> Most of my family lives in the Netherlands, so
<Pattyrick> yeah, the humor is only worthy of live-audience style loling
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm starting to think it's the center of the Internet. A lot of people I know online live in PA.
<RobotPinkie> My girlfriend's from PA, I go there kind of a lot
<Sathi> 7PA?
<Nittany_Tiger> Pennsylvania.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Pennsylvania
<Sathi> 7ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8I live in Ohio myself
<Combustiblelemons> I guessed that.
<RobotPinkie> yup
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw the about us page randomly changed font style
<Nittany_Tiger> Sad thing: I've met zero people I've known online that live in PA.
<Ghosties> Well guys
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw I didn't even touch it
<Combustiblelemons> I think I know most of the states of america's abbreviations.
<Hipster_Brony> wat
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw I'm not bothering to fix it since it's basically fine
<Sathi> and girl...
<Elky> I had to look it up
<Sathi> especially for SirSprinkles
<Ghosties> Let me apologize for not being here like I said I would. But, I spent some time with my mom
<Sathi> :P
<Pattyrick> my USB adapter is like my iPod and iPad: it uses the cool air around it to cool instead of having airflow inside of it
<SirSprinkles> 6It's cool.
<Ghosties> I felt like it was good for me and her
<Pattyrick> no cool/moving air around it = it gets pretty hot
<SirSprinkles> 6We haven't even had the rough draft written up yet.
<Ghosties> But whatever you guys did for the rules, can you just give me a run down?
<Ghosties> Oh o.o
<Ghosties> So, no revisions yet?
<Sathi> not so much yet
<RobotPinkie> I love going to the US, but that's kind of obvious.
*Ray yawns some more
<SirSprinkles> 6We're adding in stuff about spoilers, and links other than image links.
<Ray> 02z-z
<Nittany_Tiger> I've been pondering a ponychan thread seeing if there are bronies that go to Penn State, but I'm thinking that the average age of a chan memeber is too low for many college kids to be on there (no offense).
<Combustiblelemons> I want to go to the US one day.
*Pattyrick is sleepy, too
<Sathi> 7I'm thinking about returning to the US at some point
<Nittany_Tiger> US is ok. Don't mind our govt.
<Ghosties> Ah, alright
<Elky> I want to live in the US one day, it seems cliche, but still
<RobotPinkie> The snack aisle in US food stores....
<Ghosties> ...still have no idea why Veemi isn't loading
<Sathi> Veemi is down
*Pattyrick wonders what Pokemon Ray is so as to avoid crushing him incase I decide to sit on him
<Combustiblelemons> not sure what keeps the US together sometimes...
<Sathi> it's a miracle the stream is still up
<Nittany_Tiger> Corporations.
<Nittany_Tiger> That's all I can think of.
<Combustiblelemons> I asked that once and someone said "rednecks and patriotism"
<Ghosties> Veemi's down?
<RobotPinkie> lol American media is kind of nuts at times.
<Ray> 02Small dragon, not a pokemon :P
<Ghosties> Really?
<Nittany_Tiger> Money.
<Sathi> yep
<Combustiblelemons> what money?
<Ray> 02like 30cm, so be carefull .-.
<SirSprinkles> 6And the "the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit and make changes to the rules as the situation may warrant" disclaimer
<Ghosties> Did the movie finish before it went down?
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<SirSprinkles> 6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
<RobotPinkie> but when you actually meet people there, politics don't matter so much.
<SirSprinkles> 6Went down at the start of the movie.
<Ghosties> How far in was it?
<Sathi> we were able to keep broadcasting
<Nittany_Tiger> The money we give to people that won't give it back.
<Combustiblelemons> in britain politics are top of the line.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nopony noticed until the end of the movie, really.
<Sathi> 7I just drag my boyfriend with me :P
*Kosoveon sits on R- he means tucks Ray into bed :3
<Combustiblelemons> you gave europe 3 trillion dollars after WW2
<Sathi> Well people that joined were unable to view
<RobotPinkie> Most surreal experience in the US: Sitting at some cheap fast food joint talking to a couple of war veterans about tobacco.
*Ray tries to get up
<Sathi> at least that's what my pm's were telling me
<Ray> 02I dun wanna sleep
<Ray> 02:<
<Kosoveon> Ray
<Combustiblelemons> think how much 3 trillion is in nowadays money.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Kosoveon> do you WANT crow's feet ;-;
<Nittany_Tiger> A way to fix our debt crisis: Raise taxes, especially for the rich.
<Combustiblelemons> 50% tax on the rich here in britain.
<Elky> politics? in my chat?
<Ray> 02NUUUU
<Combustiblelemons> si.
<RobotPinkie> I thought prayer was the only solution :>
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know what the rich tax rate is in the US.
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw my list of BronyState duties has become fawkhuge
<Elky> it's more likely than you think
<Nittany_Tiger> It could be flat.
<Elky> I have no idea how it is in germany either
<Combustiblelemons> Britain's falling apart too.

<Ghosties> *he does show
<Elky> eh, more parties don't really make anythig better
<Nittany_Tiger> Not voting will just put more power to the ones that want the govt to do what they want.
<SirSprinkles> 6Better than Bristle who is officially demodded.
<Combustiblelemons> alternatively, march into washington with a communist flag.

<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q
<Ghosties> He is, huh?
<RobotPinkie> Force politicians to choose favorite pony before taking office.
<Combustiblelemons> Elect the brony party!
<RobotPinkie> All problems solved!
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Combustiblelemons> Who would be head of the brony party?
<Elky> I like to think that most problems will eventually solve themselves
<Nittany_Tiger> Brony Party: 20% cooler than the rest of the government.
<Combustiblelemons> Meh I'm waiting for the nuclear apocalypse.
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, I think as a general trend the world is getting better and better
<Elky> stuff like racism will slowly weed itself out
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe greed will start weeding itself out of the US.
<SirSprinkles> 6He left early July.
<RobotPinkie> Remove the economic boom/bust ups and downs, and we're having a steady upward trend.
<Ghosties> I see
<Combustiblelemons> not gonna happen tiger
<SirSprinkles> 6He should be back next week I think.
<Ghosties> Actually...
<Ghosties> >_>
<Ghosties> I completely forgot about Bristle
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, the govt.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not exactly hard to do...
<Ziltoid> greed and racism are human nature they will never go away
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Elky> but most younger people, except for a few nutjobs, aren't racist at all nowadays
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw font is randomly fixed
<Combustiblelemons> Meanwhile, in britain...
<Elky> so over the next few generations, the problem should become marginal
<Nittany_Tiger> *Time to go see what gaming publishers are doing wrong now.*
<Combustiblelemons> well immigrants face racism
<Combustiblelemons> they certainly do in our country.
<Ghosties> Question, did we have an interview with SoiPony?

<Elky> well, they do here too, but more covert
<Ghosties> ...really?
<Elky> mostly people try to hide it behind a concern about human rights
<RobotPinkie> Here too, of course. I'm just happy to see it get weaker and weaker.
<drf|laptop> 03God, I have such a painful headache right now
<Combustiblelemons> Human rights cause problems over here
*Ray turns into a block of ice
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not 100%, but I don't think we did.
<Combustiblelemons> Criminals can get away with rape because of it
<Ghosties> He says we interviewed him
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<RobotPinkie> I love everythiiiiing
<Ghosties> And that he's intimidated by Hipster :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Was probably one of the interviews I missed.

<Elky> it's okay, I was singing along in my mind too
<Combustiblelemons> lol
*Ray yaaawns and sits on Kosoveon's head
<Ghosties> So what, does that mean he's doing the rules and if we feel like something needs to be changed or tweak we speak up?

<partysmores> hey guys.
<partysmores> the stream's tonight right?
<Elky> hi
<Polarfire> its over already
<Ghosties> Holy fuck Sprinkles, overloaded yourself with your duties on the About Us page, didn't ya
<partysmores> oh.
<Elky> sorry, everything's over already
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<partysmores> ...oh crap I thought it was Friday
<SirSprinkles> 6What? I actually DO all of that shit.
<Elky> xD
<partysmores> I thought it was just starting
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Ghosties> Some of it could be in PR though
<SirSprinkles> 6And it's all stuff somepony else also does, save for Site Maintenance.
<Ghosties> Email subscriptions, for example
<SirSprinkles> 6PR deals with different things.
<Ghosties> Right, it's broad
<Sathi> 7err
<Combustiblelemons> well I'll show you what you missed partysmores

<Sathi> 7thats yesterday's show
<Kosoveon> night ray
<Kosoveon> :3
<Ghosties> And it covers things like dealing with people
<Combustiblelemons> I hope you got that >.>
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, the email subscriptions is so they know who will be handling stuff that gets emailed in.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Nini~
<RobotPinkie> http://memegenerator.net/instance/9125550
<Elky> why does mibbit collapse the images like that anyway?
<RobotPinkie> That's what you missed on friday
<Ghosties> Do you really think people want to know which mod is emailing them their BMN subscription?
<Ghosties> Is it that important to people?
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't send out the subscriptions.
<SirSprinkles> 6Some people like to know who's going to check the email if they try to contact us.
<RobotPinkie> Myeah I wonder that too, mibbit kinda blows, I guess
<RobotPinkie> I mean some images work perfectly fine
<Ghosties> -_- that's pretty meticulous, don't you think?
<Sathi> 7if I use a different site it works fine?

<Ghosties> For people to really wanna know which mod is emailing them their weekly subscription
<Ghosties> God, these people
<SirSprinkles> 6It was something that was put on the list for Silver before I even started doing stuff.
<RobotPinkie> lol that works
<Pegacorn> I'M BAAAAAAAAAACK!
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's not what I mean, Ghosties.
<Combustiblelemons> perfectly.
<Combustiblelemons> OSHI.
<SirSprinkles> 6I mean for people that email in wanting an app or asking technical questions, or putting in suggestions.

<Ghosties> Yeah, I certainly am not tech savvy
<Elky> and sathi
<Ghosties> Speaking of which, did dari give you the list or whatever?
<Sathi> 7hihi ^^
<RobotPinkie> you gotta shaaaaaaaaare
<Ghosties> He brought up the lotto earlier in Skype and I told him to direct his queries to you
<Sathi> 7gotta care
<Pegacorn> Arguing's not the way.
<RobotPinkie> it's the right thing to do
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari did not contact me about anything that I know of.
<Elky> Hey, come out and play!
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Pegacorn> .....Shut up Ralph.
<Elky> and by play, I mean, uh...
<Ghosties> Oh well, I told him to tell you about the Notepad++ thing
<RobotPinkie> You gotta keep 'em separated.
<Sathi> 7yes?
<Ghosties> Whatever that is
<SirSprinkles> 6>Notepad++
<Sathi> As far as I recall he said he had a script ready
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to redownload Notepad++ on my comp.
<Ghosties> That's probably what it was
<Elky> I should delete all those pony songs sometime
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm running all of my coding off regular Notepad... bleh.
<Combustiblelemons> I should get a pony background soon...
<Ziltoid> NEVER
<Elky> luckily, the phase when I absolutely had to have those on my mp3 player is over
<Combustiblelemons> anyone know any good backgrounds?
<Elky> now the internet suffices
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo The About Us page is doing the stupid font change thing again.
<Ghosties> [4:27:33 PM] Dari: So it'll just PM you with the list, one name on each line, and you can paste it into Notepad++ and use replace to get rid of my name at the start of each line.
<SirSprinkles> 6I literally didn't change a single line of coding.
<Ghosties> That's what it was
<RobotPinkie> I love the dark side of the rainbow background :3
<Pegacorn> INTENET,HELL YEA!
<Sathi> ;_; herdmind
<Sathi> I was copying that

<Pattyrick> Really?
<Elky> joking, I don't use pony wallpapers, so no idea
<RobotPinkie> That's my wallpaper right now
<SirSprinkles> 6That's simple enough.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll need to get Notepad++ up and running again.
<Elky> I like these though: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/megasweet-wallpaper-pack.html
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'll still have the problem of what happens if Dari isn't here, but that's just a couple extra steps.
<Ghosties> So Sprinkles, now that you have a source of income, how does it feel to not be so hungry anymore?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Boot Nittany_Tiger and Nittany_Tiger__ off please.
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying I have money yet.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Those are just dead connections.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Or they may time themselves out.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Fucking wireless.
<Combustiblelemons> I can see why people like them but I need something more awesome.
<partysmores> ...
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't get my paycheck until ...next Sunday.
<SirSprinkles> 6Comes out on Friday, but I won't be able to get there until Sunday.
<Chimera> 04mew
<Drake> 04o-o
<RobotPinkie> Aw, the one I linked wasn't awesome? :3
<SirSprinkles> 6But I get free meals when working over 6 hours... which is most days.
<Combustiblelemons> it was and it now is my background :D
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Ghosties> Right, so, you must not be too hungry anymore
<Combustiblelemons> I was talking about elky's backgrounds
<partysmores> 400 spins on Ponyspin

<SirSprinkles> 6That it?
<Pegacorn> 8-BIT CRUSADERS YAY!

<Ghosties> Oh, how'd that spicy chinese food go through you?
<Sathi> 7@Combustiblelemons I have an epic wallpaper for you
<May> 14Haha that sounds so weird
<partysmores> nothing wrong with it
<Hipster_Brony> question:
*Combustiblelemons looks on in interest at sathi
<Nittany_Tiger_> Thanks for warning me. I completely forgot about meatspin.com
<Sathi> 7-opening imgur hang on-
<partysmores> PONYspin.com, not meatspin
<Drake> 04XD
<Hipster_Brony> who is going to be our "go-to complaints person"?
<Combustiblelemons> what's ponyspin?
<partysmores> 600 spins
<Elky> don't go there
<May> 14I think he's busy so
<Hipster_Brony> as in, if someone has complaints about the rules or mod conduct or whatever
<Nittany_Tiger_> I know, but ponyspin is just meatspin with ponys, right?
<partysmores> ponyspin is not bad
<Pegacorn> I GOT RICKROLL'ED!
<Elky> worse nittany
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Sathi> 7http://i.imgur.com/k6OGv.jpg
<Sathi> 7there it is
<partysmores> no it's just a CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SPINNING AROUND
<Elky> dammit stream, Y U RICKROLL ME
<Hipster_Brony> i'd be happy to do it if you guys dont have any objections
<Ghosties> A complaint channel, perhaps? So that way the workload isn't all on just one person?
<Combustiblelemons> :D streams working
<drf|laptop> 03<Pattyrick> Really? <- yep
<partysmores> what is NSFW about that
<RainBroDash> @ghosties it should be a new mod :trololo:
<Elky> aww, you could've let them find out themselves...
<partysmores> sorrry.
<Hipster_Brony> well, heres the thing
<Ziltoid> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/136/6/e/fim__flutterage_wallpaper_by_milesprower024-d3gixer.png
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, speaking of keyboards I have like tons of keyboards and mice that my mom wants me to get rid of if you need any XD
<Ghosties> ...no, that'd be asking for problems, I guess
<Combustiblelemons> not sure whether to use that as my background...
<Elky> just kidding
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<partysmores> I'm just joking
<RobotPinkie> the links at the bottom are presumably nsfw
<partysmores> you have to see it for yourself
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly I'd have no issue with it being anypony other than the newer mods.
<partysmores> see if it's safe for work or not yourself
<Nittany_Tiger_> Is ponyspin.com NSFW or not?
<Hipster_Brony> i think we should have maybe 2 people
<Sathi> 7no Luna fan? :(
<partysmores> see for yourself
<SirSprinkles> 6I was thinking 3.
<May> 14No one wants a mouse LOL
<Nittany_Tiger_> Because I'm not a fan of porn.
<May> 14they stink
<Hipster_Brony> fine with me
<Combustiblelemons> oops
<Hipster_Brony> that handle the complaints
<Elky> well, technically it's not porn...
<RobotPinkie> I have that background saved already, Sathi
<partysmores> See. For. Yourself.
<Hipster_Brony> me, sprinkles and ghosties?
<Hipster_Brony> any objections?
<SirSprinkles> 6You sir are in my brain.
<drf|laptop> 03A computer mouse LOL
<Sathi> 7good RobotPinkie
<Combustiblelemons> Meh luna gets 5 seconds in the whole series and yet she's #1 background pony for some reason
<Ghosties> My only problem is if what happens yesterday happens again
<Combustiblelemons> anyone tell me her appeal?
<Sathi> 7I have others aswell
<Sathi> 7hang on
<RobotPinkie> I do like Luna
<RainBroDash> so, explicitly, what's the position that you're putting those 3 people in?
<Creideiki> May: Yeah, that's why most of the OSes that don't implode still have CLIs and almost nothing but. :P
<Elky> well, at least she had a speaking part
<Combustiblelemons> I don't mind her :/
<RainBroDash> like, give me your wording for now
<Combustiblelemons> so does derpy.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why there's 3 of us, Ghosties. They can just go to one of the others.
<Sathi> 7[URL=http://imgur.com/Gt93V][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Gt93V.jpg[/IMG][/URL]
<Sathi> 7grr
<partysmores> you spin me right around right around baby like a record baby right around right around
<RobotPinkie> not as much as the mane 6, but eh, I also like Cheerilee, so
<May> 14I know drf
<Sathi> 7fail
<Elky> not really
<Hipster_Brony> any issues they have that are legitimate will be fully discussed in the mod channel though
<May> 14I'm just being an idiot heh
<Pegacorn> Luna had the guts to go up against Celestia.THAT,my friends,is awesome.
<Sathi> 7http://i.imgur.com/Gt93V.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course, Hipster.
<Combustiblelemons> she says muffins
<Combustiblelemons> octavia?
<Elky> that's like saying that every pny who sang in wwu had a speaking part
<Ghosties> I guess I'll just have to accept that people won't come to me with their complaint if it's about me
<partysmores> go to ponyspin.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol @ Sathi attempting to use forum/imageboard code
<Nittany_Tiger> Luna gets more airtime next season. Hope she doesn't go evil again.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<partysmores> It will change your life.
<Hipster_Brony> but like i said, we will discuss it here
<Sathi> 7I failed
<SirSprinkles> 6It just won't happen, Ghosties.
<RainBroDash> we've had this discussion :P people are scared to complain to someone with power about said person
<Sathi> 7clicked the wrong url in imgur
<Sathi> 7:D
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not the way people work.
<Ghosties> Then yeah, I'm on board
<RobotPinkie> I hope that evil luna is not canon
<Ghosties> PEOPLE, Y U SO NOT WORK RIGHT
<Combustiblelemons> hmm... face team rocket boss or heal pokemon and come though the maze to get to him again...
<Elky> I don't care, like, at all.

<Sathi> I think you should add this to the about page
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie > all
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<Combustiblelemons> I love SPB. It's like being in the 90s again.
<Hipster_Brony> if you get a chance, can you run a trip explorer for me to find a "leverage" trip?
<Ghosties> Nice
<Sathi> it's rather important
<RobotPinkie> She's like the highlander after finishing off all other immortals.
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying it's not already on my tripcode explorer list
<Hipster_Brony> oh, so you're already looking?
<Hipster_Brony> nice
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
<SirSprinkles> 6I look for everything.
<Hipster_Brony> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm looking for a tripcode that says tripcode.
<Ghosties> Sathi, what were you talking about?
<Combustiblelemons> how long till pinkie destroys the 4th wall...
<Hipster_Brony> did you ever see that !Ponychan trip that one time?
<Sathi> the complaint department ;)
<Hipster_Brony> you mean to the "duties" section?
<RobotPinkie> She hasn't already?
<Ghosties> Oh, that sounds good
<Drake> 04XD
<Ghosties> Just update the About Us to include the mods that handle complaints
<Combustiblelemons> :D owl city fluttershies parody!
<Sathi> yes or as a special part of the about page
<WhatPayne> What is this song called?
<Combustiblelemons> I <3 this one
<Elky> ugh that song
<Combustiblelemons> UMAD elky
<Elky> YES I MAD
<Hipster_Brony> http://mibpaste.com/awfgA4
<WhatPayne> I've been unable to find this in YT...
<Hipster_Brony> good?
<Elky> SOOOOOO MAD
<Combustiblelemons> you found it now?
<Hipster_Brony> without the double numbers of course -.-
<WhatPayne> I'd like to...
<RobotPinkie> Relax, have some pony
<Combustiblelemons> type in owl city fireflies parody it's on the first page.
<Combustiblelemons> just look for filly fluttershy :)
<Ghosties> Looks good
<Ghosties> What about number of warnings/kicks per offense?
<WhatPayne> Yes! Thank you Combustiblelemons.
<interior_gummy> hey
<Combustiblelemons> :D
<interior_gummy> postshow?
<Elky> wb gummy
<Elky> not really
<WhatPayne> Now my collection is complete... for now.
<Combustiblelemons> 8bit wrap up :D
<Sathi> Looks good to me
<Elky> more like postplaylist
<SirSprinkles> 6That's in there, Ghosties.
<partysmores> you wold know believe your eyes
<partysmores> man I messed it up
<SirSprinkles> 6One warning for any given thing.
<SirSprinkles> 6Repeat that one thing, get kicked.
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks good to me, btw.
<RainBroDash> 12New Dari Bot Post: 2272
<Ghosties> Really? Just one warning?
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, that's a new one
<SilverSonic> lol so apparently i has teamspeak nao XD
<RobotPinkie> I've only read 2722 before
<SilverSonic> ./random
<interior_gummy> was there even a postshow?
<Ghosties> Don't you think it may get lost amongst the postings of around 200 people?
<Hipster_Brony> 2 really
<SirSprinkles> 6I see no reason to have to nor want to remind people.
<Ghosties> I agree with Hip
<Ghosties> 2 warnings, then kick
<SirSprinkles> 6Kicks are essentially just warning anyway.
<Espeon> 06I need to stop being shy about my voice I guess
<Hipster_Brony> nope
<Pegacorn> ADMIRE THE SPIRIT BOMB!
<Pegacorn> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ebiaEG_clZQ/TjSQtIGQGsI/AAAAAAAAJhA/QtIrePLT5ow/s1600/rainbowdash_zetto_genki_dama_by_riokenng3-d425lf9.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> kick is a warning
<Hipster_Brony> 1 warning then kick
<Espeon> 06I also need a better mic because voice_loopback 1 tells me it's terrible
*Espeon flop
<Ghosties> That's what Sprinkles is saying if I'm not mistaken
<Ghosties> I just think one warning isn't fair
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
<Ziltoid> I dont even kno whats going on anymore
<Hipster_Brony> it serves as 2 warnings before the real consequences, a ban
<RobotPinkie> needs moar rasenshuriken
<Combustiblelemons> Wonder what dash looks like when she's super saiyan
<Ghosties> It can easily got lost in the sea of posts when there's so many posts going on
<Ghosties> But how many people see a kick as a warning?
<SirSprinkles> 6If it gets buried, that just means they weren't paying attention to the mods, which they should be doing.
<interior_gummy> super saiyan pinkie?
<RobotPinkie> she's already super saiyan
<Pegacorn> golden rainbow mane and tail.
<Hipster_Brony> and imo if they are willfully disregarding the warning and doing it anyway, they deserve a ban anyway
<RobotPinkie> unless pinkamena
<Combustiblelemons> golden rainbow mane?
<Hipster_Brony> so much anyway...
<May> 14As I was saying
<May> 14I don't understand
<Combustiblelemons> wat.
<Hipster_Brony> ignore my terrible grammar
<May> 14Drake wins my battle
<May> 14But I win NightSeas
<Ghosties> I just don't think it's fair to the users is all.
<Pegacorn> (Rainbow Dash super saiyan)
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll just start including "This is your second warning. To rejoin the chat click here: #bronystate " in the kick
<Hipster_Brony> how is it not fair?
<Drake> 04And I defeat NightSeas. So?
<May> 14And he loses to Drake
*May OTL
<Ghosties> I think 2 warnings is the optimum amount of warnings followed by a kick
<May> 14Well
<Hipster_Brony> sirsprinkles: i would rather say "final warning"
<May> 14Even then
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, final warning.
<Ghosties> I can see how things get lost in chat, it happens all the time
<May> 14You said you wouldn't have won for those crits
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no problem with two then a kick about SOME things.
<SirSprinkles> 6But some things need only one warning.
<Hipster_Brony> frankly I think we have been too lenient with warnings as it is
<Ghosties> Then let's re work that
<May> 14Hey Espeon
<Pegacorn> ('Cause super saiyans ALWAYS have golden hair)
<May> 14I got muted again
<Combustiblelemons> I have no idea what super saiyan dash would look like. Too awesome to comprehend?
<May> 14:'D
<Ghosties> For the rule 34 stuff, it deserves an insta ban
<Ghosties> No doubt
<Drake> 04XD
<SirSprinkles> 6We really have, Hipster.
<Pegacorn> Eeyuo
<Pegacorn> *eeyup
<SirSprinkles> 6Colors we have a script set up that's two warnings and then a kick, so that's good.
<Hipster_Brony> im not inclined to warn a person 3 times before i ban them
<Ghosties> Colors are good, yeah
<May> 14But I wanna battle too D:
<partysmores> If Rainbow Dash were a Super Saiyan, Dragon Ball Z would be 20% cooler.
<Drake> 04May
<Drake> 04PM, now.
<Ghosties> I still think it depends
<May> 14Okay
<RobotPinkie> >implying Rainbow Dash could be any more awesome
<Hipster_Brony> at that point they are a continual problem and obviously have no intention of following the rules
<Ghosties> Last is the image/video links
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Ghosties> And also trolling
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey, guys, guess what: "Finally, the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit"
<Ghosties> That bothers me
<Hipster_Brony> problem is here though
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<Hipster_Brony> i want a concrete framework set up for these
<SirSprinkles> 6As do I.
<Ghosties> That's like saying the mods don't adhere to any actual rule and can just do whatever the hell they want
<interior_gummy> worst misspell of pinkie pie ever
<prince-dari> Doesn't bother me.
<Pegacorn> DAMN YOU INTERIOR_GUMMY!
<Hipster_Brony> so people arent going to bitch and complain saying "X mod is too strict"
<SirSprinkles> 6We need that disclaimer, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> It makes it seem like the rules are just a formality
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> That's the way it's supposed to be, you see that appened to almost all rules, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've had SO many people say "such mod is too strict, such mod is too lenient"
<Ziltoid> I have diabeetus
<Ziltoid> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zyV8S1_cXXo/TjSQlYUzZnI/AAAAAAAAJgA/Uk0lO3Lrf74/s1600/baby_octavia_in_socks_by_kelliek94-d423ohe.png
<SirSprinkles> 6The disclaimer gets rid of that problem.
<Ghosties> Then what if we get some viewer that actually has read the rules and gets upset because one mod doesn't do what the rules say because they were just "enforcing the rule as they saw fit?" That last little fine print pretty much negates the other rules
<RobotPinkie> D'awwww
<Combustiblelemons> meh 5/10 on the cute scale.
<SirSprinkles> 6...then he'd complain to one of us.
<Ghosties> And then we'd handle the problem? Why not nip it now?
<Ghosties> Why wait until it actually happens?
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, heres the thing
<SirSprinkles> 6Because removing that line creates more problems than it solves.
*Pegacorn opens a chest Zelda-style and finds the Octavia in socks picture in it,lifts it over his head and screams "I FOUND THE DIABEETUS!"
<Hipster_Brony> we NEED that disclaimer in there
<Hipster_Brony> it gives us the flexibility to deal with problems as they arise
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<RobotPinkie> Man, what's 1 on your cute scale?
<Ghosties> Let me get this straight, that disclaimer in there is more of a deterrent than anything else, am I correct?
<SirSprinkles> 6That way people can't pull loopholes on us
<Combustiblelemons> 1 being lowest?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Ghosties.
<Hipster_Brony> hell, i had bjornfot straight up tell me he was thinking about ban evading using a proxy
<RobotPinkie> I guess nothing not-cute would even be rated?
<Combustiblelemons> yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> when i told him no he said "well, there's nothing in the rules that says I can't"
<RobotPinkie> Then I'm with you
<SirSprinkles> 6And I straight up told him if he did I'd permaban his entire area.
<Hipster_Brony> thats why we need it
<Pegacorn> Kick-Ass is Kick-Ass.'Nuff said.
<Elky> not more than 3/10
<Hipster_Brony> for situations like that
<interior_gummy> what's with the meme of ponies with socks?
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: YFW he'd probably get an onion router and keep coming back forever.
<prince-dari> Till we'd banned every area in the world.
<Ghosties> That still sounds so shady to me. I can understand needing it, but it just seems so...unfair to the other users. I get it's for the troublesome pests...
<RobotPinkie> No idea, really
<Ziltoid> um nothing
<Pegacorn> Kick-Ass is my favorite movie of all time.
<Elky> it's... just there?
<RobotPinkie> It's cute though :3
<prince-dari> Ghosties, most rules have a statement like that appended to the end.
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw it takes us less time to ban a person than it does for them to evade
<prince-dari> YFW it doesn't with an onion router.
<Ghosties> I know, I'm well aware that most rules have that at the bottom. Doesn't mean I like it
<Hipster_Brony> it really is very important for us to have it in there
<Ghosties> Yeah, I know
<Ghosties> I just hope none of us abuse it
<Ghosties> Including myself
<Elky> Okay, time for bed.
<Elky> Night y'all
<Ghosties> That disclaimer will be a testament to our professionalism, if you ask me
<prince-dari> Cya.
<RobotPinkie> night elky
<Combustiblelemons> night elky
<Ziltoid> bye elky
<Hipster_Brony> if any of the mods are abusing the rules, which hasnt been the case so far, they are going to be de-modded
<Hipster_Brony> simple as that
<Espeon> 06PSA time to everyone
<Espeon> 06http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Thumb+if+it+made+you+smile+D+D_86d9eb_2420837.jpg
<Espeon> 06You're welcome
*Espeon flops out of sight
<Ghosties> Like I said, it'll be a testament to our professionalism
<Pegacorn> bye Elky
<Ghosties> I don't expect it to happen, but I've come to expect anything
<Nittany_Tiger> Looking at the past movies I missed here, I missed some good ones.
<Nittany_Tiger> Granted, I wasn't a brony until June.
<Hipster_Brony> ok, so are there any changes we need to make to these rules?
<Ziltoid> suddenly derpy
<Ghosties> What about trolling
<Veewave> Yes, its working again.
<prince-dari> MFW mods troll more than anyone else
<Nittany_Tiger> I was itching for tornadoes in May like every year.
<Hipster_Brony> the section on being respectful
<Combustiblelemons> I was one in april
<Ghosties> :D
<interior_gummy> i'm a rather new brony
<Nittany_Tiger> I had watch clips of the show by May.
<Combustiblelemons> I'm an old-ish brony
<Hipster_Brony> >3.	Respect other users at all times. Do not personally attack other viewers or act rudely
<Ghosties> So if anyone just outright goes "YOU'RE ALL FAGGOTS, MY LITTLE PONY IS FOR FAGS" that's pretty much an insta kick yeah?
<RobotPinkie> I've only been a brony like... 1-2 months?
<Nittany_Tiger> And the slumber party one, which was not a good one to start with.
<prince-dari> To be honest, I'd just ban outright for that.
<Hipster_Brony> i'd ban straight up for that
<Combustiblelemons> I think the moonbase alpha ponies pulled in a lot of bronies.
<RobotPinkie> Only started really getting into the community very recently
<prince-dari> Because they clearly have nothing worth contributing to conversation.
<Hipster_Brony> cuz they're obviously trolls
<Ghosties> But we've had that before, and those guys have been kicked. Don't know if they haven't been banned later, but I've seen them only be kicked
<Combustiblelemons> the community is the best part of it.
<Ghosties> And THEN if they come back in and do it again, they're banned
<Hipster_Brony> and trolls arent going to read the rules anyway
<Ziltoid> aeiou
<prince-dari> Well, I'd ban outright for it.
<Ghosties> In fact, that's how I did my first night moderating
<prince-dari> Anyway, not all mods react the same way to different things.
<RobotPinkie> Well, without ponies, no community :3
<interior_gummy> i only converted at like the end of june
<Hipster_Brony> i banned outright when we had that mini-raid a few weeks ago
<Combustiblelemons> I suppose so
<prince-dari> For example I'd like insta-ban for racism.
<The_Si> Likewise.
<prince-dari> Not everyon agrees with me.
<prince-dari> everyone*
<Combustiblelemons> Hooked since the first episode
<Ghosties> You'd insta ban for disliking Rainbow Dash, dari -_-
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't really convert. I just slowly slipped in.
<interior_gummy> my first movie night was july 15
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, lots of awesome creative people in the community
<Hipster_Brony> oooh, dari, good thinking
<Combustiblelemons> I didn't need any more convincing that ponies were awesome after ep 1.
<Hipster_Brony> im going to add that to the respect section
<Ghosties> This seems to be tying into the disclaimer at the bottom.
<RobotPinkie> I guess I didn't need much after the first episode I watched, wasn't the first though
<Combustiblelemons> the music is beautiful from bronies
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh wait. My tipping point was "ponies that can control the weather!"
<Ghosties> I am glad we've decided to have complaint persons, and thank god we have the mod chat
<RobotPinkie> Someone linked me to episode 6, and I watched it :P
<Combustiblelemons> :D love this song
<prince-dari> >implying disliking RD is as serious as racism. :P
<Ghosties> Because dari's right, every mod uses his own judging and discretion
<prince-dari> Or implying that I'd think that anyway.
<Nittany_Tiger> That was from the same episode.
<Ghosties> I heard you banned SoiPony for saying something about RD
<Ghosties> A joke, of course, but still XD
<RobotPinkie> Then I jumped to Episode 1 and watched the whole of season 1 in a week.
<SilverSonic> lol
<prince-dari> Haha, I probably did.
<Chimera> 04'Daww thanks Espy :P
<prince-dari> Trollbans for all!
<SirSprinkles> 6>a week
<Combustiblelemons> in a day.
<Ghosties> Oh lord
<interior_gummy> my tipping point was probably "it was under e". odd, i know
<Combustiblelemons> LIKE A BOSS
<SirSprinkles> 6I watched all the episodes that were out at the time in a day.
<Ziltoid> lol wat
<RobotPinkie> lol some people have to work and study :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Granted, there were only ten. XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Someone linked a channel I was in to "Green Isn't Your Color" before Photo Finish says "The Magicks!"
<RainBroDash> what happens late night in BMN stays late night in BMN :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Then I proceeded to watch the rest of it.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was ok.
<Combustiblelemons> there were about 24 out when I joined
<prince-dari> BMN Caffeine Edition madness I expect.
<Pegacorn> DA MAGIKZ.
*Nittany_Tiger pulls up an episode list.
<Ghosties> Damn, I've only modded 11 BMNs
<interior_gummy> the season was over when i discovered ponies
<Combustiblelemons> wait which ep number was philomena in?
<SirSprinkles> 6More than me. XD
<interior_gummy> 22?
<Ghosties> True
<Ghosties> And Hipster only has one over me, and that's Superman IV
<SirSprinkles> 6Also...
<Combustiblelemons> I had to wait for that one so there was only 21 episodes on youtube when I joined
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying that 11 isn't almost all of them
<Ghosties> Again, true
<Ghosties> I can't believe it's only been...that
<Ghosties> It seems so small in comparison to the actual streams
<SirSprinkles> 6I've modded 8. And the postshow for week 4.
<Hipster_Brony> added to rule #3: Do not post anything that is needlessly offensive based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc…
<Ghosties> Good
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, season was over when I discovered it too
<Nittany_Tiger> A Bird in a Hoof.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds good to me.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ep 22.
<Hipster_Brony> also, im going to add a rule about starting drama
<interior_gummy> yay
<Pegacorn> AVAST FLUTTERSHY'S ASS TIME!
*Nittany_Tiger has the list.
<Ziltoid> yay
<SirSprinkles> 6YES.
<Hipster_Brony> the "cupcakes" rule
<Combustiblelemons> :D yay
<Ghosties> Don't do it?
<RobotPinkie> Whee
<interior_gummy> yay
<RobotPinkie> oh oops, I mean yay
<Ghosties> HIT US WITH IT, HIP
<Hipster_Brony> basically
<SirSprinkles> 6Mention Cupcakes, get banned : D
*SilverSonic bored
<Combustiblelemons> granted that the title throws you off how epic this song is
<Hipster_Brony> 1 minute while i work out the wording
<Ghosties> wut
<RainBroDash> the question is, do we explicitly mention cupcakes in the rule?
<Ghosties> No, no no
<Ghosties> Now THAT'S oppressive :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Kidding, obviously.
<RobotPinkie> Haha, the title is what keeps me from linking people to it :P
<RainBroDash> it might as well be 'mention cupcakes get banned' :P
<interior_gummy> i could just scream
<RainBroDash> i PM everyone who mentions it and make sure that they understand that it's not right and why
<Ghosties> Do we kick if they try to stir up drama, or warn and then kick?
<SirSprinkles> 6Depends on the severity of it.
<RobotPinkie> *squeak*
<Ghosties> That's another thing, I think PMing the drama starting is a good idea
<Ghosties> It singles them out
<Ziltoid> what i dont remeber this part
<Nittany_Tiger> So it was like half of 20, then 8, then a clip of Flutterguy (that was good), then I started watching them from 1 - 26.
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying that everypony reads the PMs without having to be told they were sent one.
<Ghosties> Well, obviously we have to tell them "You have a PM"
<Combustiblelemons> new remix?
<RainBroDash> PM is way better than going 'DONT TALK ABOUT CUPCAKES' no offense to silverscreen but i cringed hard when he said that
<prince-dari> >implying I don't send notices instead of PMs
<Combustiblelemons> a less popular avast applejacks ass thrown into it I hear
<Ghosties> Unless we put up something about the PMs in the rules
<RainBroDash> I try really hard to make sure that I diffuse the problem without letting anyone know about the problem existing XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, notices are typically better.
<Ghosties> Notice?
<Ziltoid> um
<prince-dari> :P
<Ghosties> I never use those : /
<prince-dari> They appear in the same window as normal chat.
<RainBroDash> can you send me one dari?
<RainBroDash> ty
<RainBroDash> I'll remember that, infinitely much better than PM
<Ghosties> ...did he get it?
<RainBroDash> cause i dont have to say 'hjsgd check your PM'
<Ghosties> Oh, sweet
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, channel notice works.
<interior_gummy> who was the first brony?
<interior_gummy> yay
<SirSprinkles> 6...my ad is for gmail. XD
<Combustiblelemons> some guy who watched G1 ponies?
<Ghosties> Oh, so that worked?
<RobotPinkie> Adam was the first brony
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Ghosties> The message didn't come up for me : /
<Ghosties> Does it not show up to the sender?
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't.
<Ghosties> But sprinkles, you saw it?
<RobotPinkie> oh wait, there's no mythology here?
<interior_gummy> adam west! :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.
<RainBroDash> :w
<RainBroDash> :3*
<interior_gummy> o hi doggy
<SirSprinkles> 6Cheese was the first brony.
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing several guys watched the first episode at the same time.
<Pegacorn> ohai prince-dari,you're my favorite customer.
<Hipster_Brony> added: 6.	Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please do not bring up controversial topics. This would be including, but not limited to, discussions about politics, religion, “Cupcakes”, furries, and other topics not mentioned here.
<RobotPinkie> ohai dari
<Ghosties> : /
<Veewave> Do we have to watch the room again guys?
<Ghosties> So, leave out anything that's not fun
<Ghosties> God, that feels so limiting
<interior_gummy> i would love to watch the room, never got to
<Ghosties> I know, I know, we need it
<Hipster_Brony> it seems that way until the entire chat turns into a giant shitstorm about Cupcakes
<Lolipop_of_Doom> What is with dari's red name?
<Ghosties> I'd like viewers to think that we're not completely stripping them of their right to free speech
<RobotPinkie> I missed it, but I've seen it already, so...
<Pegacorn> YOU'RE TEARING ME APART RED NAME!
<interior_gummy> i'm a pinkie pie fan and still, rd is my favorite
<interior_gummy> *in the gala
<RobotPinkie> WHAT?
<interior_gummy> just in the gala song
<Hipster_Brony> posting here is a privilege, not a right
<RobotPinkie> Still... :(
<Ghosties> Look, the way how I see is that as long as the discussion remains civil, it shouldn't be looked down upon
<prince-dari> RD is just BEST at everything.
<interior_gummy> pinkie is my favorite overall
<Ghosties> I have a real problem with that
<Combustiblelemons> what dari said
<Ghosties> Honestly
<Veewave> You have to see it, it will make your life at least 20% cooler.
<Combustiblelemons> trixie didn't beat her.
<RobotPinkie> The one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie :(
<Hipster_Brony> >implying discussions on those topics ever stays civil
<Ghosties> >implying it always happens
<Ghosties> Because it rarely does
<Ghosties> And it's almost always for Cupcakes
<Ghosties> But, even then, it gets defused when we remind them to not stir up shit
<Sathi> 7TS is best end of discussion :P
<Hipster_Brony> thats why we need that rule
<RobotPinkie> No dari! Bad mod!
<Hipster_Brony> to keep people from stirring shit up
<interior_gummy> trixie has to be the most overrated character though
<Ghosties> That's restrictive though
<Ghosties> I don't like the rule
<Ghosties> That's way too limiting
<Hipster_Brony> 8 1. RD 2. TS
<Hipster_Brony> 8dealwithit.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> Sethistio, Y U NO HATE TRIXIE
<Pegacorn> Trixie is not supposed to have a fanbase,yet she does.
<Combustiblelemons> 1. RD 2. Cheerilee.
<interior_gummy> nobody likes gilda though
<Ghosties> That rule implies that people don't have the common decency to be civil
<prince-dari> 1. RD 2. Derpy
<interior_gummy> except her ex, rainbow dash
<Ghosties> It's insulting
<Sathi> I agree with Ghosties on this one. I think we should just put leave the drama at the door
<Pegacorn> Gilda is like Francis from L4D,so she's awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> because in most cases they dont
<Combustiblelemons> not really
<Hipster_Brony> and it only takes one or 2 people to turn the entire goddamn chat into a shitstorm
<Ghosties> We still shouldn't put the banhammer down on someone for saying that they're a furry
<prince-dari> LOL, this vidwo.
<prince-dari> video*
<Sathi> 7 1 TS 2 RD nuff said
<Pegacorn> Well,i thought so.
<RainBroDash> 10Scratch > RD > All
<prince-dari> Top comment is awesome:
<prince-dari> "Push 4 4 4 5 6 4 5﻿ 6 4 for the imperial march song."
<RobotPinkie> y u all hatin' on mah ponies
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Sathi> 7all ponies equal!
<interior_gummy> 1. gummy 2. steven magnet 3. madame le flour 4. mr. turnips
<Hipster_Brony> and im not going to have the entire event get ruined because chat derailed into a discussion of cupcakes that got everyone angry
<Combustiblelemons> Pony communism!
<RobotPinkie> 1. Mane 6 2. Cheerilee
<Ghosties> When has that ever happened?
<Hipster_Brony> if people want to discuss those things, they can go to /dis/
<Combustiblelemons> Cheerilee is awesome.
<Ghosties> There's always been someone there to tell them to stop
<Hipster_Brony> its nearly happened 4 times that i can think of right off hand
<RobotPinkie> She needs an episode in Season 2
<interior_gummy> cheerilee sounds like sarah palin
<Ghosties> But it's always been quelled
<prince-dari> RainBro: Vinyl Scratch is your favourite pony? :o
<Hipster_Brony> until myself or another mod put a stop to it
<Pegacorn> I always thought Gilda was like Francis from L4D ever since i first hear her talk.
<Hipster_Brony> twice with cupcakes, once with furries and once with religion
<Ghosties> It's never gotten to the point that the entire chat got in a fucking uproar about it
<Combustiblelemons> please don't ruin it for me gummy
<Hipster_Brony> and i intend to keep it that way
<RainBroDash> 10dari: yup
<Hipster_Brony> thats why the rule is in there
<Pegacorn> *heard
<prince-dari> Wut
<Ghosties> I do not accept that rule
<RobotPinkie> As long as she doesn't THINK like Palin, I'm fine with that.
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Ghosties> I refuse
<Combustiblelemons> what dari said
<RainBroDash> 10Dari, what?
<Ghosties> It's not fair to anyone
<Ghosties> Not even us
<SoiPony> problem?
<prince-dari> RD not favourite pony: BANBANBANBNABNABNBBNAABNBABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBABNABANBANBABNABANBANBANBABANBANBANBBNABANBANBAN
<Combustiblelemons> I has problem.
<interior_gummy> but seriously, 1. pinkie 2. rarity 3. spike 4. fluttershy 5. rainbow dash
<RainBroDash> 10LOL
<Ghosties> If people can't be themselves without us pushing down on them, then that's a shit rule
<Sathi> 7oye
<Sathi> 7you forgot someone
<RobotPinkie> spike is not a pony!
<interior_gummy> he is a character
<Hipster_Brony> if they want to talk about cupcakes, they can go somewhere else or PM or whatever
<interior_gummy> and he's attracted to fillies
<RobotPinkie> I guess I'll accept that... He does have taste.
<Hipster_Brony> but in 2 of those cases i had to tell people to stop discussing the topics or i would start handing out bans
<Ghosties> Then re word the rule, don't make it sound so oppressive
<interior_gummy> in mustaches
<Hipster_Brony> i fail to see how it is oppressive
<Ghosties> It literally sounds like people can't talk about religion or politics
<prince-dari> Evil Spike is best Spike
<Hipster_Brony> im telling people not to start drama
<prince-dari> MWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> *Moustache twiddle*
<Pegacorn> I wonder if we'll play requests.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, villain Spike was awesome
<Ghosties> Read the rule
<Ghosties> Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please do not bring up controversial topics. This would be including, but not limited to, discussions about politics, religion, “Cupcakes”, furries, and other topics not mentioned here.
<Ghosties> It clearly states "no talking about politics or religion
<Ghosties> That's completely fucked up
<Sathi> thats why I said leave the drama at the door
<Ghosties> We're not allowing people to talk
<Combustiblelemons> agreed dari
<prince-dari> I dunno, who needs to talk about religion and politics anyway?
<Hipster_Brony> because those topics ALWAYS start drama
<prince-dari> A lot of places have rules agaisnt bringing up those topics.
<Hipster_Brony> EVERY
<Ziltoid> no love for owlicious
<Combustiblelemons> owlwlicious isn't in any of the other episodes though >.>
<Hipster_Brony> SINGLE
<Hipster_Brony> TIME
<interior_gummy> owlowiscious is a dick
<prince-dari> ...
<Ghosties> We shouldn't have to tell them DON'T TALK ABOUT RELIGION, DON'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS, WE'LL BAN YOU OTHERWISE
<prince-dari> interior_gummy: How dare you.
<Ziltoid> no
<RobotPinkie> Is he even going to be back?
<Ghosties> That's so goddamn oppressive
<prince-dari> All he ever does is be helpful. ;_;
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<prince-dari> And he gets so much hate for it.
<Ziltoid> owliscious just wants to help man
<Pegacorn> Owlicious has a stupid name.
<Ghosties> That's not fair
<interior_gummy> he just helps twilight at night ;)
<Ghosties> Just tell them not to start drama
<Ghosties> that's all
<Ziltoid> gross
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<Ghosties> If you can change it to that, then I'm fine
<Combustiblelemons> ._.
<Ziltoid> wat
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 4Azumarill.
<Hipster_Brony> functionally its going to be the exact same thing
<Combustiblelemons> how would that even...
<Ghosties> Even on Ponychan, people talked about it
<interior_gummy> that's what she said in the episode
<prince-dari> >supposed to be fun
<SirSprinkles> 6I say take the "politics, religion" out.
<prince-dari> >people talk about politics and religion
<Combustiblelemons> I'm not gonna think about that.
<prince-dari> >andnoasinglefunwashadthatday.jpg
<prince-dari> not*
<SirSprinkles> 6Some political discussions and religious discussions are good.
<Ghosties> And Ponychan can be pretty restricted, honestly
<Ghosties> Thank you, Sprinkles
<Ziltoid> the stream oh dear
<prince-dari> I've never seen a good one.
<prince-dari> Not on the internet.
<prince-dari> NEVER.
<SirSprinkles> 6If it turns to shit, we warn them.
<Hipster_Brony> if people are bringing up those topics, im going to ask them to stop
<Ghosties> Hipster, just leave out the "NO TALKING ABOUT RELIGION AND POLITICS" bit and I'm good
<Combustiblelemons> anyway have some awesome cheerilee.

<ScriptBot> SilverSonic, you are a 2Swalot.
<SilverSonic> ;o
<prince-dari> I'm fine with leaving that bit in.
<Ghosties> Actually, just say "don't start drama"
<Combustiblelemons> it worked :D
<prince-dari> >Politics and religion. INSTANT SHIT STORM EVERYWHERE
<Ghosties> Don't purposefully cause a shit storm to happen
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<Hipster_Brony> i dont know if you guys have been to the /dis/ board, but not a single thread on any of those topics doesnt involve a shitstorm
<Combustiblelemons> that is why I like cheerilee.
<interior_gummy> she's teaching the colts and fillies about /b/?
<Hipster_Brony> and thats even when rule #1 on the board sticky is "don't be a dick"
<prince-dari> You can't bring up politics and religion without a shitstorm. It's not possible.
<interior_gummy> best teacher ever
<Ghosties> People on Ponychan are fucking masochists. They wanted a /dis/ board and yet people argue all the time on there from what you just told me
<RobotPinkie> Also she's a teacher, how's that not awesome?
<Hipster_Brony> they do
<prince-dari> Ghosties: It isn't possible on the internet.
<Ghosties> But it's not right to tell people that they can't talk about something
<prince-dari> Politics and religion ALWAYS end badly.
<Ghosties> It's
<Ghosties> no
<Ghosties> t
<Ghosties> right
<prince-dari> Usually as little as after the 2nd comment.
<Combustiblelemons> not every teacher is awesome :S
<prince-dari> Why not?
<RobotPinkie> Well, no...
<Ghosties> And besides, the only people that ever do are pretty much trolls
<prince-dari> Is this some "freedom of speech" thing?
<Ghosties> Yes
<RobotPinkie> But I refuse to think of Cheerilee as a bad teacher
<prince-dari> It doesn't exist on the internet. Viewers can DEAL WITH IT.
<Ziltoid> arnold was a teacher in a movie once
<Combustiblelemons> also, 80s cheerilee is epic.
<prince-dari> :)
<Pegacorn> ANWSER MY QUESTION PRINCE-DARI!
<Ghosties> I'm telling you, I can't accept the rule as is
<prince-dari> What is it?
<Pegacorn> If we'll play requests!
<SirSprinkles> 6I guess leave it in. After all, we'll enforce them as we see fit.
<prince-dari> Oh, I don't know. The whole of veemi is down.
<prince-dari> So I can't stream, I don't know if Sprinkles is still streaming.
<prince-dari> I can't load the stream.
<Ziltoid> I can
<Combustiblelemons> the streams working for me
<Hipster_Brony> i started this as an event for people to have fun and watch movies with other bronies, not as a chatroom for them to talk about divisive topics and have everyone get pissed

<Pegacorn> It's working for me too.
<interior_gummy> i'd like to see my video request :D
<Hipster_Brony> ill be damned if thats what i let it become
<SirSprinkles> 6>it's almost 9
<Sneas> 03eo.o
<Sathi> well as mods we can cut discussions down if they turn into shitstorms?
<Ziltoid> oh god
<prince-dari> >if
<Pegacorn> I'mma post a request!
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Hipster_Brony> it becomes much harder once theyre in progress though
<Hipster_Brony> MUCH harder
<drf|laptop> 03!pokemon
<SirSprinkles> 6No you're not~
<prince-dari> As has been said there is not a SINGLE discussion on the internet that's not turned into a shitstorm when it's about politics and religion.

<Ghosties> Look, I'm well aware that this thing started because we wanted the fans to have something to do. And I like all the other rules, because I think they belong, but telling people that they can't talk about something without you guys automatically assuming it's gonna become a massive shit storm is just unfair to the users. It's insulting
<SilverSonic> ooh
<HyperMetalLugia> YEAH
<RobotPinkie> as in disturbed?
<Ziltoid> no
<Ghosties> And it makes it sound like we don't have any kind of faith in them and that they're fucking nothing

<Ghosties> We never NOT do anything
<Hipster_Brony> >they leave and dont and come back

*Combustiblelemons walks off into the sunset
<Sathi> 7goodnight Combustiblelemons
<Pegacorn> bye lemons
<Ghosties> What the fuck are you talking about? I think the mods have the appropriate judgement to know when someone's causing trouble
<interior_gummy> next week, hopefully
<Ghosties> Otherwise, that there sounds like you don't believe we have the professionalism to step in
<prince-dari> Causing trouble?
<prince-dari> They have to be trying.
<Ghosties> You're undermining our abilities
<prince-dari> They just have to mention one thing someone disagrees with.
<prince-dari> Then EPIC SHITSTORM within 30 seconds of that comment.
<prince-dari> Especially on instant messengers.
<Ghosties> I can't believe you guys seriously think that this rule is actually going to stop it
<prince-dari> Even on God damn forums they don't take long to form.
<Hipster_Brony> it gives us the ability to stop it before it gets out of hand
<Ghosties> WE ALWAYS HAVE STOPPED IT
<Ghosties> FUCK
<SirSprinkles> 6It won't stop it, it - DAMMIT HIPSTER
<prince-dari> XD Sprinkles.
<RainBroDash> It won't -stop- it per se, but we have a solid anchor to kick/ban from
<RainBroDash> other viewers see the negative repercussions
<Ghosties> I'm stepping away from the chat, I need to clear my head before I say something I'll regret

<SirSprinkles> 6Wouldn't be hard to do, but wouldn't get much traffic atm.
<SirSprinkles> 6And would be fairly pointless.
<prince-dari> Meh, a forum would help keep dedicated viewers.
<Dashite> Holy crap! Someone else bought Shattered Horizon?!
<Hipster_Brony> with this it would give us a concrete rule to point to for those complaints
<RobotPinkie> I'm gonna go for today, just working on my WWU vests right now anyway
<prince-dari> And would give viewers a place to discuss BMN things in a place where their comments won't just disappear.
<prince-dari> And would give them somewhere to place complaints/suggestions, etc.

<Ziltoid> goodbye robotpinkie

<Pegacorn> bye RobotPinkie
<Pegacorn> YOU GOT A FRIEND IN ME.AWESOME.
<prince-dari> You could put it on the new domain.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd play more MP if my attention span wasn't poor and my aim wasn't poor.
<Sathi> With a forum we could also keep track of our modstuff / discussions
<SirSprinkles> 6This is true.
<Dashite> Daxton, you will forever be associated with NewDCD mental break downs in my mind.
<Nittany_Tiger> And a lot of modern FPSs have unlocks that give skilled and long-time players an advantage over you.
<Sathi> or discuss future plans / ideas
<Nittany_Tiger> Like unbalancing damage perks.
<Dashite> Have you played Witcher? I don't see any time listed on that one.
<Ghosties> I'll accept it
<Ghosties> But I sure as fuck don't like it
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties did you read the reasons i gave after you left?
<Nittany_Tiger> I've been meaning to play Mass Effect after Star Wars: Dark Forces, but that game is getting dull.
<SirSprinkles> 6...he logged off, Hipster.
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<Pegacorn> Aladin?
<Ghosties> As I said, I'll accept but I don't fucking don't care for it
<Nittany_Tiger> And a bit harder than I want.
<Hipster_Brony> let me explain, because i do think its important
<Nittany_Tiger> But more of the fact that it's getting dull.
<Elision> oh ballsacks
<Aeroslash> wb Kos
<Ghosties> You can explain it all you want, but it seriously sounds like some fucking Minority Report bullshit
<Kosoveon> thanks
<Hipster_Brony> i see it on ponychan ALL the time
<Elision> I just rmemebered that I did have to miss both shows after all
<Ghosties> Exactly, and I fucking hate that shit
<Aeroslash> nb and hi Obsi
<Hipster_Brony> stop for a minute
<Ghosties> I hate that this one little slice of the internet is supposedly a safe haven from harm
<Obsi> hihi
<Aeroslash> *np
<Hipster_Brony> let me finish before you interrupt
<Nittany_Tiger> I really, really wish DICE would make their MP games friendlier to people like me.
<Ghosties> Go right ahead
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't get into them because most of the games consist of me losing to higher-level opponents.
<Hipster_Brony> like i said, on ponychan i see it happen where people say "OMG YOU BANNED ME BECAUSE I HAD AN UNPOPULAR OPINION, YOU GUYS ARE TYRANTS"
<Nittany_Tiger> So I can't enjoy the game on account of frustration.
<Nittany_Tiger> BF2 was the same way. Too hard to get into.
<Pegacorn> Goodnight everypony!
<Hipster_Brony> with this rule in place, we make it clear that they are being told to stop NOT because of their opinions, but because of the topic
<Nittany_Tiger> Night.
<Denied_Existence> Night
<Ghosties> Are you done?
<Nittany_Tiger> I need a fucking tutorial on BC2.
<interior_gummy> pocahontas?
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Denied_Existence> Sounds like it
<Nittany_Tiger> I can stream a game or two of me playing.
<Caaz> I am now convincing MtChar's friends he has ate a bug.
<Nittany_Tiger> And you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.
<RainBroDash> 12New Dari Bot Post: 2722
<Ghosties> The way how you wrote the rule sounds like you're restraining the members of the chat because you feel like no one can be civil at all without it becoming a goddamn shit storm. And dari pretty much said that's what he believes, so with that, if you keep the rule as it is, I want you to publicly address the main chat, mute the channel, and tell them
<Ghosties> That the reason we have the rule is because we don't have faith in the regular viewer and that we don't think they can behave apporpriately
<Nittany_Tiger> Honestly, you shouldn't have to take a class or watch YT videos just to play an MP game.
<Ghosties> Tell them
<Ghosties> It's goddamn insulting
<ReticentSmolder_> hey bronies, surprised so many people are still on
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Ziltoid> hello
<Hipster_Brony> im telling you right now, its not possible
<Denied_Existence> Nittany_tiger, what stream will it be on if you do?
<ReticentSmolder_> just got back from Cowboys and Aliens
<Ziltoid> again
<Ghosties> Then tell them
<Hipster_Brony> the majority of users probably can
<Denied_Existence> How was it?
<Nittany_Tiger> Either Tinychat or UStream.
<Ghosties> Tell them that we don't think they can be civil without guidance
<Dashite> Saw that yesterday.
<SoiPony> lol
<Sathi> 7so much EQD posts suddenly :o
<Hipster_Brony> but all it takes is 2 assholes to start shit to completely fuck up the whole chat and ruin the event for everyone
<Nittany_Tiger> I was broadcasting Orbiter from Tinychat one night.
<ReticentSmolder_> that wonderbolts dash doesn't look that great
<Ghosties> You're assuming that every person in the chat thinks and behaves that way, and they don't

<Hipster_Brony> but let me tell you what happens
<Ghosties> Then why are we singling out everyone
<ReticentSmolder_> oooooooooooooooooh
<prince-dari> Since he seems to find it SOOO funny that I made a mistake.
<Hipster_Brony> person A voices an unpopular opinion
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 12:D
<Ghosties> Why do we have to put down everyone else for a couple of assholes
<Nittany_Tiger> And actually, I'm thinking of modifying parts of the Saturn V and putting a mesh of Luna on the moon.
<Hipster_Brony> person B disagrees with said opinion
<Ghosties> You're not answering my question
<Hipster_Brony> flame war starts
<Ghosties> Oh god
<Hipster_Brony> everyone gets sucked in
<Denied_Existence> Good luck with that.
<Denied_Existence> You'll need it
<Ghosties> Like I said, I'll accept it. But I don't like it
<Nittany_Tiger> Me?
<Kosoveon> how was sucker punch, sky?
<Ghosties> I don't agree with it
<Denied_Existence> Yes.
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually have artistic skill.
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Skylands
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, it's because all it takes is one person that can't be civil.
<Nittany_Tiger> And I have a plan to do it.
<SirSprinkles> 6The majority of our viewers are civil.
<Skylands> 10It was pretty good
<ReticentSmolder_> I wish I could synch my comp to you guys, I'm about to watch Silent Hill :D
<Ghosties> Then why punish ALL
<SirSprinkles> 6But we will eventually get ones that are not.
<Skylands> 10Dad walked away from it in 30 minutes though XD
<Nittany_Tiger> A) Download plugin to handle texture files.
<Nittany_Tiger> B) Modify them in GIMP.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<Skylands> 10The action was kinda fake
<Sathi> 7but you can...
<Skylands> 10Needs more rated R action
<SirSprinkles> 6Because people get heated up by arguments easily, and are not easily calmed.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah :p
<Hipster_Brony> our job is to keep this event fun and inclusive for everyone
<Nittany_Tiger> C) Put modified files into correct folder. Make sure the file name of the new texture matches that of the old file.
<Nittany_Tiger> B+) Create a copy of the old texture.
<Hipster_Brony> not to make sure everyone can talk about whatever they please
<ReticentSmolder_> but I can?
<Skylands> 10action scenes, that is
<Nittany_Tiger> Wouldn't you need the code to the website?
<Nittany_Tiger> And to be a mod?
<Nittany_Tiger> To broadcast here?
<Ghosties> Fun?
<ReticentSmolder_> yeah what he said
<Hipster_Brony> thats why we would kick people out for posting racist stuff or R34
