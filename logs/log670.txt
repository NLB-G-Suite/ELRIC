Hey someone help me out! If I buy "Total War: Medival 2" NOW, do I still get the 'King of Scotland Cape"? O_O
to Da
or email
I have no idea.
Y U DISAPERA
I want iiitttt
:<
dat backround music
night guys
Democape.
Also, is it only 'Gen' quality that is untradeable?
Nite {swa...
And the reason was this:
/me voms
:o
like many promo items
TL DR
yours is fine
Well, most of them, IMO.
O_O
oh come on, the vps is down AGAIN
I can still buy one of those games and get it
this is unacceptable
Time to A-Rank Grand Metropolis
Some OC's I find pretty creative. It's just that the majority are incredibly horrible.
Which one? Medieval II: Total War or Total War Battles: SHOGUN?
yep until october 1 it seems
http://obstacol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Didnt-READ.gif
Most OC's are utterly terrible.
^
ohh wait both give you the same
^
my oc is an alicorn
just kidding its a unicorn
well if you only want the item go for the cheap one medieval II
You can somewhat draw but you do have some anatomy problem
i was searching for bad OCS and i found this one. but imo its good and creative http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/299/2/1/mlp_oc_pony___gear_hawk_by_metadragonart-d485lei.jpg
around the age of the cmc

Squirrels live on land already.

But trees are land-based.
Therefore, squirrels are land-based.
distantly related to fluttershies
Fluttershies are land-based too.

11,02Sound is off?
Speaking of!
Rain: Why dont you apply for a mod position :3

i think
Rain: Youve got the attitude thats for sure >:3
or i'm suffering sleep depriviation

I never was one ^_^
Rain: I imagine like getting kissed by celestia
my application got thrown out before it ever reached the mods for voting ^_^
Rain: Ehhh.....Why???
Were ya' being a deliquent? :3
In my honest opinion.
/me shrugs
Brutally honest.
I hate evrything about the idea of moderatirs
Not sure why...
/me shrugs
Maybe its cause i just hate authority :3
Meh
i dont deserve to be said hi at anymore
too much hassle?
I already have bad migraines. I dont need more of them
Rain: Ha! I can see how that would happen.
Well
for all its worth
I think you would have been a great mod :3
i can tell no one wants me here anymore for spotting me spying on them
Rain: not like i did
-lol

00,02pony_6396, negative wheel friction
I got a Non-Driver's ID

Hi everypony :D
Got my moped card with two points off. ._.
https://www.service.transport.qld.gov.au/rrtexternal/SelectExam.jsp
It goes up because you don't have a supervisor anymore... Damn trick questions. :P
Thats all I used
00,02Chrysalis, the idea is those 120 hours are spent with an instructor, but anyone with a licence is legally able to instruct
brodash, G'day
00,02and there are a lot of morons out there with licences teaching other morons
00,02thus the chinese wisper of driving knowledge continues

that was played too recently
Really? Damn...
...
Aliens? :3
Carpenter is a special effects genius
the first 3 alien movies were all shown over the summer. I don't think The Thing has been played though
FULL MOON TOMORROW
but i want to see trainspotting and tron!
To be honest the effects were the only thing I liked about The Thing. The movie itself didn't impress me
damn
Aliens 3*
yep, 3 was played for the trilogy event
Ahh trilogy
oh, Ranjid rettet die Welt hits the theaters soon :3
I just want to forgot I even watched 3 and 4...
Bleh, 3 was like the first only shittier and more cruel
forget*
I know how about we watch my Gopro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak?
They played the extended version of all of them. 3 did was not good enough to justify an extended version
*I know how about we watch my Go Pro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak for 20kg TUNA?
it was awesome. Tara Strong cosplayed as Twilight
and?
And they brought in a bunch of non-pony actors to do a VA rwading of Boast Busters

The irony is strong in that one.

Hehe <3 The Catcher in the Rye
They're dry, but they were suppressed.
Very few books about Nazis get censored.
And I had to wait in lines for 3.5 hours for Tara Strong's autograph

Oh and guys, have some humanized ponies http://fav.me/d4r821l
The thing about furry its a bit sexual.
it's a fetish of course it is
No in my opinion its not
Everytime I hear fetish all I can imagine is Saturn
though there are some people that just enjoy furred character because they're cute
That's fine for you
but let's put that subject into a close
sensitive subject
