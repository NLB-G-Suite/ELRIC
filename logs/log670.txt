okay
but Limev is up
sweet, you're gonna draw?
Say, can I suggest something? If for whatever reason my choice of B-Movie gets WMC, can we watch LittleKuriboh's version instead?
A GUNSHOT
bang
good lord when is 15 coming out :/
Just pre-empting the suggestion.
dat Heavy picture
00,03NO
00,03We are watching Blue Eyes Shining Dragon Kick some ASS!
lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: yay :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: also watching it get WMC
isn't Blue Eyes Shining Dragon a useless card?
the plot holes are ENDLESS
Dken2021: no
/me eyerolls
00,03NO
not pony intended
heres what i have to say to the B movie. Ahem, ASS SANDALS
00,03It's MLG LEGI
05lets see if i can provide soem entertainment :P
00,03LEGIT*
http://derpy.me/d7amC Wrek
Dken2021: I dunno but in the show it was badass.
BESD is a great card
00,03Wrek: You should draw a Blue Eyes White Dragon
or at least was
If Pyramid of Light gets WMC'd, I insist that we go back and WMC about six other movies on the old roster.
Because it's seriously not WMC material.
and then Alej was Kaiba
Blue Eyes is THEE Most Badasss MLG LEGIT PRO muthabuck EVER!
Scoot-Scootaloo: How about a Blue Eyes Whiet Spike:D
00,03Kaiba is premier MLG
So the only way to rationalize it is to raise the bar by a lot. <_<
Dang it typos
I just want to say, I have NEVER seen Pyramid of Light. At all.
im sad that we will never watch Human Centipede here :(
00,03A Blue Eyes White Spike.... someone do that
if most of us are complaining about the yu gi oh movie, cant we just cancel it?
howabout...
00,03No.
/me doesn't get people's obsession with that clause anyways. It's supposed to be for things that are literally unwatchable.
CCCP: you are disgustinjhg
Scoot-Scootaloo: In Spike form or Giant Dragon form?
alright, just bought Garry's Mod
superretroworld Alej here INSISTED we do it
00,03I.. don't know...

MrBen it means you cancer

Macho Ladies Guild
MrBen: Major League Gamer.
CCCP: stfu, that is very inapropriate
CCCP: I'm not going to dignify that with a response and ignore the fact I just did so.
00,03Ah, that's super awesome, AJIsAwesome! Looking forward to what you can do!
bit of a framerate issue compared to normal
AJIsAwesome: Ah. I thought I asked that before, but...bad memory.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Don't count on it, though. I've got college to think about. :$
ah, now it looks better
MrBen: ignore CCCP he is fucked up
Is anyone else having problems loading videos youtube?
*on youtube
Bronysith thats mo nice
so, anything to expect from garry's mod?
Dken2021 - depends on what game mode you play
inb4 LadyCanary... oh wait
i've only played Garry's Mod for Trouble in Terrorist Town
also i was reffering to canccer of the interenet not real cancer MrBen
shell be back...
CCCP: ahh so like you
Bronysith *bronies
CCCP: nah just you
Well, still, regardless, the fact I won the lottery--even when I wasn't intending to--still blows my mind.

but I need other people though :\
Wrek is playing some Planetside?
Ahh I missed the EqD writing month
The Hills are allliveee... With the sounds of Buuuulleeeeets
but since we love and tolerate, why are we considered the caner of the internet?
we are the diabetes of the internet
cancer*
DerpyMuffins: There was an EqD writing month?! I was too busy psyching myself for NaNoWriMo this year. >_M
superretroworld: Society.
Well, I'm gonna head out. See y'all Friday!
I though we were the common cold of the internet
Later!
idk thats what finebros said
"It's quiet... too quiet..."
seeya MrBen
Are there requirements for NaNoWriMo?
inb4 screamer!
superretroworld: FineBros didn't say that, they were quoting what people say about bronies on the internet.
Hm, so from what I hear Tony Stark hasnt arrived yet.
Wrek - is this a beta or can i just go and download it?
DerpyMuffins: 50,000 words in 30 days i.e. 1st-30th November.
AJIsAwesome: ik, i meant to say that
00,03Wrek! Y U NO rock music?
Silly scoots.
LadyCanary not that I know of, also hey there

Kandarihu: what do you mean?
I actually don't ever remember a time where you and LadyCanary are on at the same time, TeamScootress.
DerpyMuffins: No. I've done it two years now, passed both and am getting ready for year 3.
We have been, plenty of times.
00,03Because we are... the SAME PERSON O_O
When does it start?
O_O SHIIIIT.
TeamScootress: ;o
*:O
...And then Wreky was Scout. \:3/
superretroworld, there's a lot of hate to go around. 4chan is treated like that. Conservatives get it in spades.
GilDash: havent heard from you in a while
Kandarihu: how did that happen again?
superretroworld: I've been on sparsely, but a little more recently as of late. You doing okay?
shoot that core! or whatever it is
Hm, I like dis song~ also DAT COWBELL

DerpyMuffins: NaNoWriMo? This november. Basically 1 month from now.

LadyCanary: would you care to explain then?
GilDash I thought they had just announce the winners on EqD for the 50k words thing
@mods is there by any chance we get can access to canterlot gardens live?
Someone on irc yesterday said Sumi sounded like Tony Stark.
And then I said Wrek was Thor.
08,01i love mexican food
LadyCanary: ahhh~ shit makes sense now
yup
DerpyMuffins: NaNoWriMo isn't pony related. It's been going on for a good while now.
yes
08,01LadyCanary: i bet he leaves you tho thor you can hardly pith
GilDash PM me for NaNoWriMo?
DerpyMuffins: Sure, hang on a sec...

Okay.
MadSurge, yes
Dem shades
LadyCanary: y u no stay with the viking?

Kandarihu: then greetings from the future, it's already your birthday here :3
What the heck are you talking about Bronysith
LadyCanary, Wrek is MLG viking, how can you not know? :D
forgive me LadyCanary i wasnt thinking clearly with the muffin pies
Oh I am aware AdamTheDuck.
taoumi: are you eventually going to do OCs perhaps?
i'm alwase open to do OCs
sweet, i just need to get my luna first
huh, i would've expected that pixel thing to be on
don't run into the potential of copywright with OCs :3
Buytoast: you expected wrong
taoumi: but hasbro wouldnt do that, they didnt do that with youtube vids
unless they decide to be jerks
i think it's butts that tell on the artists
you mean trolls?
or anti bronies?
yeah >.>
xD funny thing i used to tech swimm elssons
till i got the boot
das boot
fwah
i wonder what Bronystate Mods OC plushies would be like
^
dumb question
Hmm? Why?
I actually am a pretty good swimmer, but I need to lose some belly :D
00,03like plushies.
Bronysith, Fund... It? :D
I liek plushies ^_^

But FUNDS Bronysith =3=

Bronysith - depends on the Methane content, of course
fund the secret butt funds
Hey, everypony.

hi DerpyWhooves :)
Hehehe. Butts.
This game is looking gorgeous
Hi, DerpyWhooves :)
Butts are fun. :D
how are things DerpyWhooves
Wrek: do the ladycanary
hello Derpy_Hooves
Well, it's gorgeous on Wrek's awesome computer.
Lol, everyone always says that.
...YOU'RE DOING A SHIZU VI ONE?!
OH MY GOD FINISH THAT ONE.
So, what did I miss?
>W< Soooo cute
13if somepony felt that explosion
hey killerpony7733
13it was shizu wub hitting the roof :3
<3
Shizu, that drawing will be absolutely adorable.
13<3
Bronysith I'm here don't fret
anything Wrek draws is either sexy or adorable...sometimes both
taoumi: killerpony7733 is the guy who wants 2 plushies made
O_o
Shizuka: any particular reason you like Vivi so much, besides her adorableness? :)
Wow, the chat already crashed.
13because vivi ist best pony~
I hate this laptop.
oooh
Damn right shizu.
Bronysith I may not had told. But i kinda had to turn down then thought for a reason
ahh~
jeez it sounds like someone caught the flu
Wwat game is this?
*What
planetside2
Kandarihu: do you have steam? :O
Oh, he sure plays this a lot.
MadSurge, yes I do. My Steam nick is Kandarihu
Bronysith: yeah me :I
so who knows how to make cupcakes?
everything tastes like shit
Oh right. You're already on my friends list
oh look its Wrek :)
I have stated an opinion
oh look its another person
Hmm, do they do movies anymore?
Legend of Equestria is going to be horrible
but not because of the content
What is Legend of Equestria?
looks fine to me CrimsonPhoenix
cachi01, again, not because of the content
Hmm.
CrimsonPhoenix Community is my guess?
DerpyWhooves: a MLP mmo
killerpony7733, Yeah pretty much
CrimsonPhoenix Ah any specific reason you say that?
mostly horrible OC everywhere
chat needs more plushies
^
if not OC it would be pretend characters
indeed Bronysith
vinyl plushies
CrimsonPhoenix: oooh lol
I saw "Mic" in one screenshot
08,01FlutterMac is adorable
and Doctor Whooves in another
also some horrible color scheme
funny thing about that i was going to make a vinyl for my convention display
CrimsonPhoenix Oh yeah surely, i mean you could always encounter good OC's and all but yeah theres a huge % that will be bad and horrible sadly
^
80% will be alicorns
:D
lost brothers or sisters of celestia
cachi01, is that an option?
cachi01: try 95%
please someone tell me no
PLEASE
cachi01 Actually you can only choose 3 options earth pegasi unicorn
thank you
oh thx god
Alicorn BETTER NOT be an option.
might be for the mods
Each with their respective racial benefits
or u might have to pay for it
nice shot
cachi01, a MLP fan game? Pay content?
no just no
who knows
CrimsonPhoenix - yeah, won't happen
Hasbro would be on them in a heart beat
^
we never expected mario to have DLC
CrimsonPhoenix Nope LOE said it's a pure no with money
and then
assuming it doesn't get shut down on principle before then
BOOM
They make it for free
cachi01, Mario is marketing, fan-made content isn't
0,5Hihi
killerpony7733 - "free" doesn't matter when it comes to copyright
which is why Shards of Equestria was shut down
MirrorImage Really depends on how you go with it i believe
shards of equestria?
MirrorImage: Wait, they wanted you to pay for SoE?
killerpony7733 - lets put it this way. Fanfiction is still in a rather gray area
Sony online entertainment.
but most companies tolerate it
Shards of Equestria
wuuuuut
cachi01, also one could clearly see the DLC in Mario the moment Nintendo announce DLC in 3DS that will start with Fire Emblem
cachi01 - it was a fan-made expansion to Magic: The Gathering with a MLP theme
0,5Hihi
Hiya BaconMane
Ohai, BaconMane :O
MirrorImage: oooh
ello BaconMane
hello BaconMane whats going on tonight?
so BaconMane, i hear you might be bald by next year
bacon
inb4 bacon
Hu BaconMane,

hi BaconMane :)
BaconMane: taoumi is the plushie artist, if interested please talk with him
hi BaconMane
BaconMane? Bald? Where would I get my Bacon?
Oh, thank you very much, MadSurge!
0,5So many hellos >.>
taoumi: you do plushies?
dat BaconMane
cachi01: i sure do
taoumi: awesome! can i see some of your work?
BaconMane You're a butt.
Kandarihu: oh dear, how clumsy I am, it seens I "accidentally" sent you a gift~
A big one at that.
DashWithRainbows: oy stop startin
0,5Plushies eh? ssweey
DashWithRainbows: Why?
<3
Also, hello BaconMane!
BaconMane: Hello, hello, hellooooo. Hello
AJIsAwesome Because it's BaconMane. I named him Lordbananabutt when he was LordCelestia, so I still call him a butt because he is always going to be a butt.
MadSurge, oh. Did you mean to send it when it's my birthday in my time zone?
DashWithRainbows: :D
taoumi: thats awesome!!!! you take requests?
i sure do
taoumi i think i watched the video where you gave that to her.

taoumi: wait. you are the one who gave the twi plushie to tara!
taoumi, how much for a Luna Plushie? or a Rarity one?
taoumi: lol u r awesome
taoumi hi
taoumi: i know you will do great on my luna plushie <3
it will be done soem time after my c++ homework
:[ LUNA PLUSHIE!?
taoumi what do you charge?
but rarity shouldn't be too hard
taoumi, how much?
shipping, materials and labor
material, shipping and about 90 for me. ususaly totals around 120
~30 is material
shiping if i nthe us is minimal
Canada
well almost everyone left Meanwhile so i think i'll stop for now
shouldn't be too much more expensive
my, taoumi, what a fine Twilight you made! :)
Fair enough, I stopped anyway.
Managed to wrangle a spot on my favourite orangex3 map.

I cant anything for the life of me
ALso
Haku has arrived
/me gangnam styles on [SWAG]Haku
your 1337ness is far beyond me, i have no idea what you said taoumi
stream hates me..
[SWAG]Haku: i met taoumi at dragoncon and he is a plushie artist
Yo Bronysith, wazzup?
i haven't used that since middle school xD
im gonna redownload steam later
Who is this that is playing?
http://i.imgur.com/tRdGM.jpg legs and tail done for rainbow dash, a regular sized rainbow dash for reference beside it.
[SWAG]Haku: why that is Wrek
huh
I always picked him... differently
*pictured
Pew pew~
[SWAG]Haku: so if interested talk with taoumi about plushies
[SWAG]Haku: I always pictured him with a battle axe before i saw him.
I do not know who that is
Brad[Laptop]: hey thats awesome what material do you use?
cachi01 abs plastic
[SWAG]Haku: he just got on bronystate
oh
I have yet to paint one though i need to get some courage to paint them :P
I see Wrek exactly as I saw him, I can tell just by his ponified self
[SWAG]Haku: he makes plushies and i met him at dragoncon, he made one for wrex and sent it to him and is actually working on a luna one right now
and yes that was horrible grammar
cool
where is taoumi hes been idle for a little bit
i can justify spending 100 bucks in shirts and a bag, sadly i can't justify spending 100 bucks on a plushie otherwise i would buy one
^
i'v been talkign to CrimsonPhoenix
ahh
lol
Hello new person
I am Haku
And I am your god
i just want to huggle luna
I spent $100 on a rainbow dash & a rarity hat from ebay
Spectrum_Rush: I saw as a little bit older. Judging by his facial features, I though he would've look about 3-4 more years than he does now.
Fia from the fia man
No god of mine would use [SWAG]
that seems conservative compared to some plushies Brad[Laptop]
^
what TheGreatAndPowerfulT
said
Woah
AJIsAwesome: he looks older with glasses
Haku is back :3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it's called handicraft
IVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
would you prefer YOLO? :D
:o
I DO NOT USE swag
I USE SWAG
you pay someone to spend their time on something you want
SWAG! PUNCH IT!
2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS
<3 Wrek <3
it's not industrial
YESSSS.
CrimsonPhoenix wrong ping perhaps ?
SWAG > swag
wut :I
http://i.imgur.com/0Gw0U.gif HOLY MARMALADE OF SWEET SUGARY GOODNESS
Its hard to explain
Spectrum_Rush: True, but I saw his OC with some facial wrinkles. That's why I thought he was a couple years older than he looks like.
being normal > SWAG > swag
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, no I'm pinging the right person
[SWAG]Haku: what is your stance on YOLO?
d3rb I know, you can really go nuts if you want.
:I
fuck YOLO
you pay someone for their time and talent
I dont mind spending money on stuff I like.
pffft swag, hah I don't need swag when I've got Mojo baby yeah
:/
Swaggery.
Entertainment is worth a lot to me.
so is there a diffrence of yolo and YOLO?
swagtology
having inteligence>Normal>retarded>swag>yolo
Bronysith: and we'll never know what happened to them
on*
The only Mojo Haku cares for is Mojo Jojo
paying 100 for something in stores that's made in factories now THAT's expensif
CrimsonPhoenix oh i see i lost where the convo was going still i can't justify a 100 bucks plushie because it has no practical use for me
swag 101, how to be a tool
No there is not a differences between yolo and YOLO
swag 101 how to be stupid
Why not Aku, [SWAG]Haku :|
YOLOMLGSWAG
Aku is awesome
yolo 101 how to be even more stupid
A plush is totally practical, it sits on your desk and looks good.
:P
Look
YOLO 101: Carpe Diem for dumbasses.
Aku: "Long ago, in a distant land,"
should combine the swag and yolo classes, basically the same thing
Me and several other people made a bronystate clan type thing
Brad[Laptop] i already have a applejack and twi to do that
what LadyCanary said
we made up a name
TheGreatAndPowerfulT lol
Sounds like a bug
and turned into an acronyn for SWAG
TheGreatAndPowerfulT Im kind of cheating, I can just make a new pony whenever I want
Red fuckers? as in Tr? I resent that.
So We're All Gods
SWAG
ah huh
Brad[Laptop] soap ones or modeling clay?
Ahhh interesting.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT plastic
takes about 3 gours
hours*
But its all automated so I just sit back and relax.
Hell, I never even knew about swag until after SWAG came to be
and wait.
Brad[Laptop] cool but i guess you already own the materials/tools to do that
Brad[Laptop]: How much do 3D printers cost nowadays?
YOLO: You obviously love octavia
TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah lol
Oh wow. They litterally made Allatum just like Dahaka and Zurvan.
AJIsAwesome I got mine for $820 with shipping and taxes
I think I like.
but it was a 13 week wait.
cachi01, i am all for yolo if thats what it shall be known as from onw
cachi01 I fear that for when OCty sings in S3
3D printers?
Brad[Laptop]: Okay.
Everyone will be saying YOLO
AJIsAwesome I want to get one that does color :)
Brad[Laptop] you can paint them manually :p
Anyways
wouldnt it almost be more cost effective to paint it tourself though Brad[Laptop] ?
back to HAku
i want a new phoenix wright game to come out already
[SWAG]Haku: yes?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah but then i have to mix stuff to get the right shades and I know it wont be exactly how i want it
Bronysith: just wait for 6 motnhs
Im quite particular about how things look lol
do colour 3d printers exist??
d3rb yes
The only reason I still have SWAG on my name is because I am the last memebr of the original SWAG clan type thing
cool
d3rb: they cost a shitload
Brad[Laptop] well if you keep trying until you get it right you could sell those you know
I dont think im worried about cost effective at this point, haha.
d3rb: also there is such a thing as fully 4d print, but again, expensive
that is why Haku has the SWAG
4d.....?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT you think people would like larger plastic ones?
it prints in other dimensions?
I like my 3d printed models more than the actual toys as they are more accurate to the character models
I know perfectly how the actual swag thing started and how its used by idiots today
if i know anything about this fandom they would buy pretty much everything
lol
thats true
mhm
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, as long as it looks like g4 they will buy it
[SWAG]Haku: didnt swag start with old spice?
No
still plastic ones may get you in trouble with hasbro unless they are OC's and never characters from the show
I just dont like how the toys are not accurate to the show models
Brad[Laptop], ikr
^
[SWAG]Haku: well after those commercials is when i noticed a huge rise in people saying swag
swag started a long time ago when people would advertise gay orgies with the term swag, which meant Secretly We Are Gay
poker face "rock*
wait...... dafuq song

Brad[Laptop]: so you made that model? what did you make it in?
tigher1001: who?
twilight_sprinkle I didnt make the computer model, that was done by someone else, but i can slice it up and print it out in plastic.
WAIT isnt that a halo map
Wrek: hopefully by the time the full game is released i can actually play without my game crashing T~T

PeachStreak: Yep, that's the guy in the video.

J_E_Smith71: I'm intrigued, but I prefer Apple Spice.
LadyCanary: dont you know want to know whats in the box?

AJIsAwesome: you should see my friends OC he told me to draw for him
PeachStreak: Okay.
AJIsAwesome: i will upload him shortly
and then Doom
Perfect music choice.
i wouldt say perfect but still perty good
i need to play doom
Sometimes, I really wish My tiny labtop could withstand the force of an online game and not crap out on me
thelonepony: Nothing really interesting, I'm afraid! My AC thermostat died, if that could be considered exciting... Anything interesting happen at Canterlot Gardens today?
Kinixys: There was the VA panel, the script reading for starters
J_E_Smith71: Cool. I'll have to check those out. Did Andrew WK show up today with a brony shirt on? XD
Listen to that Doom music <3.
<3 doom
wait, didn't Ponies47 said he'll be at Canterlot Gardens?
I wonder if a live action DOOM movie would be good
Kinixys: Not at his panel
it wasnt
There IS a live action DOOM movie.
YESH DOOM
thelonepony: Yes.
And it...sucks.
But it's on YouTube alread
Really?
i like how Wrek keeps his sunglasses on indoors way to keep ur swag up Wrek:D
[SWAG]Haku, it really was bad
Huh
13it doesn't suck
J_E_Smith71: Yeah but he was coming back the next day to sign autographs n such.
13it SUCKS
Well I say we remake it
Yeah, it does.
i need to play doom
Into somthing good
Kinixys: Well I don't know about the autographs yet
Meanwhile: better off playing Doom :3
[SWAG]Haku, I say we pick it for B movie
Bronysith, are you saying youve never played it?
08,01Brad[Laptop]: i'll draw your OC for monies
Eh, Im still hoping to see Fox and the Hound
OMG
What?

im waiting to watch lion king 1 on here
hmmm?
WHY ARE THE PLUSHES OF MY FAVORITE PONY, TWILIGHT SPARKLE, 66 DOLLARS!?!?!?!?!?
Lightningwolf: talk to taoumi after hes not busy
Because plushy makers hate you.
oNLY 66 DOLLARS?
Oh boy! Wreky drawing times! ^___^
Lightningwolf: Are they custom made?
Drwing time
I'll tell a story about my friend Dashell's (The admin of Equestria Forums) story at Canterlot Gardens today.
hmm?
And then Wrek made stuffs
PeachStreak.....I don't know what to say
Well I got two out of four autograph. i think I fucked up though cause Dimaggio was in there but... I somehow ended up exiting and I guess I couldn't go back in ::)I thought I saw a line there."
taoumi: Lightningwolf wants a twilight plushie apparently
Wow that is a really bad OC.
now what he playing
Don't worry CrimsonPhoenix I said it for you.
Okay souh guys, there's going to be a shirt of Shining Armor saying, "That's right." very soon. :monster:Anyway, so far today has been fun. Went to Brony Breakdown (wooo!) I was front and center. Which was fun because I'm so damn short so it was nice to be able to actually SEE! I really enjoyed it. Saberspark and Paleo did a great job. SoGreat was so funny. I really got a kick out of the interview.
xD sure i'm alwase good to make another twi.
Then it was TIME TO STAND IN LINE :Pthe line was ridiculously long but not as bad as Bronycon. Plus it was moving rather well... but after about an hour, some staff came by and told us that if we had vouchers for just Tara Strong, we'd have to come back because her session was ending... so about half the line left.
PeachStreak: I would recommend telling him to change the OC's hair and tail. Black and red is used WAY to often in OC's nowasays.
Meanwhile: im no pro so dont be hatin plz
original character?
yes
Well, Haku shall turn in for the night
taoumi: what about another Luna after Bronysiths ?
Bloody hell that sentence gave me an aneurysm.
the deed is done i cant erase
So long Everypony, until we meet again
HEN... a moment later another guy came by and said Tara was going to stay for ANOTHER session. ^-^ So basically I was happy cause I'd have 3 out of my 4 autographs by the end of it. the line moved... slowly but surely and it was still faster than Bronycon. Eventually they split the line into two. The Tara Strong line and the not Tara Strong line... so Appleshy who got in line about an hour after I did ended up getting in the room before me.
Meanwhile - it ain't over yet
bye [SWAG]Haku
tl dr
J_E_Smith71: Tl;dr.
[SWAG]Haku: Bye. :)
night [SWAG]Haku
Okay maybe I should link the posts...but I can't because of stream

i can't keep up with this chat
Wrekception.
O___O

keep it like that
Hey someone help me out! If I buy "Total War: Medival 2" NOW, do I still get the 'King of Scotland Cape"? O_O
to Da
or email
I have no idea.
BERRYPUNCH
Basically she was saying that the lines of Tara and diMaggio were so big they had to split them in half
Y U DISAPERA
I want iiitttt
:<
dat backround music
PeachStreak: Just letting you know, he should change the color and hair of his OC. Black and Red have been overused way too much in OC making. Also, change the eye color. I see red too much in many OCs. That's just my opinion, though.
RaveBrony maybe
night guys
Oh my GOD, my prayers were answered :D Not only a cape, but for Demoman!
nite alexxm
Democape.
should be for medic .... i would paint it
Night, alexxm :)
But she had to stand in line for like 45 minutes for John Dimaggio.
AJIsAwesome: he says he'll make a new OC cause i cant erase colored pencil
I wonder what Wreky is drawing :o
Also, is it only 'Gen' quality that is untradeable?
Nite {swa...
PeachStreak: Okay. Just letting you know. :)
CrimsonPhoenix: all the bad colour combination sense
And the reason was this:
anyway, FINALLY the line was moving... and a staffer came out and I asked if John just had a lot of people in there or something and he said the problem was (okay get this)... that some people were having like 10 minute or longer conversations with him. They said they're trying to "limit" the conversations... are you kidding me? I just stood in one spot for 45 minutes so someone could tell John Demaggio their life story?
/me voms
it will become tradable eventually
night alexxm
PeachStreak: Didn't want to hurt your feelings. :)
:o
like many promo items
Okay should have broken it up again
TL DR
RaveBrony http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/King_of_Scotland_Cape
CrimsonPhoenix, ocs in a nutshell
d3rb, pretty much
AJIsAwesome: you didnt criticism is welcome just dont be to harsh
yours is fine
Well, most of them, IMO.
O_O
"anyway, FINALLY the line was moving... and a staffer came out and I asked if John just had a lot of people in there or something and he said the problem was (okay get this)"
oh come on, the vps is down AGAIN
I can still buy one of those games and get it
this is unacceptable
Time to A-Rank Grand Metropolis
Some OC's I find pretty creative. It's just that the majority are incredibly horrible.
Which one? Medieval II: Total War or Total War Battles: SHOGUN?
yep until october 1 it seems
"that some people were having like 10 minute or longer conversations with him. They said they're trying to "limit" the conversations... are you kidding me? I just stood in one spot for 45 minutes so someone could tell John Demaggio their life story?"
http://obstacol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Didnt-READ.gif
AJIsAwesome Can't agree more
Most OC's are utterly terrible.
dunno what class you play the most
^
AJIsAwesome: is PeachStreak creative
whose this guy
And as always, anyone who makes their OC an alicorn needs to be kicked in the teeth.
PeachStreak: Sure. I like the name. :)
Meanwhile: Couldn't agree more.
ohh wait both give you the same
^
I play Demoman the most <3
AJIsAwesome: read the journal part and it tells how she came to be
welp im off to bed, gnight you crazy bastards
my oc is an alicorn
Chat is now Agrees!
take it easy Bronysith
PeachStreak: If you want some advice on its backstory, talk to me on dA. :)
anyways Pony color aside PeachStreak you might need this http://derpy.me/hGR-T
spitfirecolt: your creativity level, ZERO
Too bad i missed out on grabbing 'A Rather Festive Tree' before it started going up...
Night, Bronysith :)
/me kicks spitfirecolt in the teeth.
just kidding its a unicorn
well if you only want the item go for the cheap one medieval II
You can somewhat draw but you do have some anatomy problem
around the age of the cmc
I never understood the alure of having an OC
00,10that looks like a Shizu Vivi friendship
I spy a shizuvi
but thats the difficult choice. The 6 year old game for $2.50.... or the new game for $4
:3
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.
cachi01: It's an interesting OC. It's not that bad, IMO. :)
Eh.
13our top story tonight, large crater appears in central minnesota, explosive wub is suspected

00,10hai LadyCanary
Shizuka: it was spuderman!
J_E_Smith71: It's pretty awesome that the VA interact with the fans so much. So how long did you wait total for all the autographs?
Ohai Sumi ^_^

Then theres the thot of "People are still able to buy it, knowing the item you get" So... will I just be able to easily buy it with metal/keys.
cachi01: Added as much as possible.. that has to be a parody.
Kinixys: I didn't go. I was telling a story of Dashell (Admin of EqF)'s experience with the autograph lines
0,5Plenty of people have been doing it all around
13i want his toaster
First rule of NDA is you don't talk about NDA.
05plenty of people are breakign the NDA then
She was moved around like three times
BaconMane: YOU BROKE THE LAAAAW
BaconMane: That doesn't justify it, though. :D
J_E_Smith71: Ah, my bad.

05still doesnt justify that you are breakign the NDA bacon
BaconMane i do read agreemnts on betas
Im supposed to be saving the $15 in my Steam wallet for the next sale.... now this...
BaconMane Actually it's common knowledge what they mostly entail
Wrek - it's their fault for not making the NDA mind-blowingly obvious then
Dat sexi Shizu
05MirrorImage: not really
MirrorImage nope
13aaaaack i do not think i saved the last one ><
dat classic shizu sketch
working on a copter… http://i.imgur.com/GdLc7.jpg
wrek~
Wrek - the purpose of an NDA is that you want to keep things secret
about that commission!
if you want to keep things secret, make it painfully obvious you want that
Brad[Laptop]: nice.
0,5Oh well, I saw other people doing it for a while now and I haven't seen any of them taken down
Brad[Laptop]: looks cool. now add some kerbals!
http://i.imgur.com/VqHnS.jpg
if they didn't make it painfully obvious that there was an NDA, it's their own fault if things get leaked
BaconMane: For now...........
with landing gear
Brad[Laptop], dat carbon fibre
d3rb it is :)
i dunno i buy the collection cause i like RTS and becuase medic item looks cool
tasty...and expensive
wait Legend of Equestria isn't in Closed beta
very expensive
00,10they cant take it down because they are dead BaconMane
I saw those too, and i love them! But... i never play Medic.
00,10you are next
^ :O
I dont even know which gun to use for him ffs
MirrorImage keep thinking that and you will get sued one day
00,10they are realy cracking down now a days
black and red OC's bucked in the face
TheGreatAndPowerfulT - if i sign something with an NDA, i expect them to make that NDA extremely clear
you should've seen the 3 pages of NDA i had to sign when i had an internship with Dollar Bank in Pittsburgh
13i still want his toaster
MirrorImage, you should understand it before you sign it
The problem is, I dont like these types of games at all... But i would give the newer one a chance.
d3rb - "should"
welcome to the Internet
Shizuka: so you can toast toast?
Yay Wrek art stream :3

Kinixys: Written by FiW Rarity :D

CriticKitten: I think... Shizuka and Vivi~
MadSurge: Huh?

I think this is lovely <3.
Wrek, Sai cannot handle wubs of that magnitude
Love those images. :D
13wub is wub~
Kinixys: you know Friendship is Witchcraft?
^_^
Cutest pony couple. Back off, Lyra and Bon-Bon. :|
So much wub!
Even if it mostly looks to be one sided.
MadSurge: Oh I got you now. XD
i gesh dats the best answer
Shizuka: if only there was a way to have you two meet for realsies
Who is Wrek drawing?
Yes!!
<3
who knows
/me ninjas into chats
00,10checked the logs Spectrum_Rush, dont have many pm's from you
Shizu and Vi, DerpyMuffins
Meanwhile: Mer?
DerpyMuffins: Shizu and Vivi's OCs
holy crap Reikim
/me spots Reikim
CriticKitten: Mer? The hell does that mean?
00,10so unless you were useing a diffrent name that day it must have been in manechat
This song reminds me of that relic Alpha Centauri. Firaxis really should remake that.
Meanwhile: elf, basically
Now I remember the....brown mane
Hey Sumica!
Dark_Horst: ...what?
Meanwhile: it's from skyrim
00,10hi MadSurge
Sumica: thought so, yeah probably manechat
Meanwhile: It's like a meow, but shorter and more questioning. :|
everyone has seen Meanwhile's self-portrait right? http://i.imgur.com/0C2rJ.jpg?1
CriticKitten: Right, well despite having 5, I don't speak cat.
kirzstryfe: most likely :D
kirzstryfe: :D
kirzstryfe :D
I'm never going to see the end of that am I kirz.
...Meanwhile has cats?
eeeenope :3
Meanwhile: Pft, fine. I was asking "whaddya mean, one-sided? What are you talking about? O.o"
Reikim: 5 cats a husky 3 chickens and 3 Degu.
Husky. <3
^
what's a Degu?
Husky is best dog breed
Meanwhile: mer is elves in general. just different prefixes. falmer, dunmer and so on
skyrim
00,10kinda scarry when logfiles are aproching the 1gig mark
All other dog breeds wish they were as baws as huskies
No wait it makes perfect sense.
loto pets CriticKitten
:D baws
A degu is http://derpy.me/rkOlA
kirz ^
so... land-squirrel?
Dark_Horst: Wat. There's another meaning to my favorite term? PISS OFF SKYRIM, I HAD IT FIRST.
Squirrels live on land already.
CriticKitten: Funny, I think german shepards beg to differ.
squirrels are tree-based
:P
But trees are land-based.
CriticKitten: seing how it's sthe same lore than every other elder scrolls game, i highly doubt that^^
Therefore, squirrels are land-based.
distantly related to fluttershies
Fluttershies are land-based too.
Testing.
Dark_Horst: Don't care. I totally had it first. I'll paw-wave your logic by claiming that I can see the future.
okay then
Did I miss Allegr0 and Gigabit's stream?
Nope.
Twas cancelled.
CiderIsForDrinking: Cancelled.
CiderIsForDrinking: It was canned tonight
that's like saying pirates are land-based because taverns are land-based, when we all know that pirates are water-based
Ah
CiderIsForDrinking cancelled :(
LadyCanary: but why?
CiderIsForDrinking: They couldn't do it tonight, canceled due to technical difficulties.
the pirate's natural enemy, the ninja, is air-based
Yar
So who's streaming now?
man im hungry im gonna make me a sandvich
HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
CiderIsForDrinking: Wrek.
...Okay kirz I concede.
wazzup bronystate?
so Wrek, what exactly is Vivi doing with that Shizu there? :3
Hi, RDash5000 :)
kirz: Trying to look like it'd work?
dat art
hi RDash5000
we might have to call for a hoof-check on Vivi
I have sandvich and hi RDash5000
00,10dawwww
i love the fact that i've been on this site long enough to recognize other users :P
Is Wrek shipping Vivi and Shizu?
Yes yes
The art's really cool. But it's also interesting watching Wrek as he draws.
^
13vivi x me ist true bronystate ship~
0,5YEah just like that [icture
o.o
I thought Vi x Octavia was the only true Bronystate ship.
?
Vivi x Shizuka x LadyCanary is the only canon bronystate ship
more true than otakon x everything Shizuka ?
^^"
0,5That drawing someone made which takes place after vivi and shizu kissie kissie
aaand just as i thot, too late :D
13x rain x woona~

The only true BState ship is otakon x everything. We talked about this already.
kirzstryfe: ya forgot Rain
Hm?

Just that someone mentioned "rdash" somewhere lol
rdash Try having the most common letter as a username
It's ping city
DerpyMuffins: Otakon Ships With Everything.
*shrugs*
i used to have that problem when someone said wonderbolts, then i used a 3 instead of e rdash
He's the Guile's Theme of BronyState, except with shipping.
How did this Otakon x everyone start?
Panda|Homework: lol nice
rdash btw, pm me please.
G'night everypony! :)

Cya GilDash

Panda|Homework - which is why you pick an original username that's just a slight bit convoluted
see ya gildash
Night GilDash
Or pull something out of an RNG.
wond3rbolts
MirrorImage, Panda has been my nickname since I was 13 >.> Its the only thing I could think of.
*Random Name Generator
Reikim - oh good, i thought you were suggesting a Random Number Generator
:D AH DAT ROSE
huh, that didnt ping me somehow Spectrum_Rush
00,10did some one say random name >_>
Sumica isnt a random name.

Sumica, google it XD

Oh.
A hat.

my current name was more or less randomly selected
Yeah, lol
One of those fancy things us F2P peasants cannae have.
Give you 3 buds for it.
not sure why it popped into my head. turns out it's a spell in 1st edition D&D
which might've done it
Lol
Mine's pretty explanible.
*explainable

Crayotic?
Regardless, im happy with this cape <3 And the spy 'tie' doesnt look so bad either!
00,10there was no google when i started useing it Panda|Homework
Sumica - boy, i bet you feel old now
i fixed it though
Wrek you should probably swap the expressions.
altavista for lyf yo
Sumica O_o there wasnt? Nvm. then :3
Meanwhile - no, that'll just make BaconMane seem like a creep / stalker
or is that otherwise accurate?
Sumica: guessing Chase was part of the original random?
MirrorImage: He's...not in this image.
00,10MirrorImage, seemlike?
MirrorImage: But yeah it'd give off the right impression.
00,10yep

DerpyMuffins: Meant to talk to NewSuperBronyU. :D
cachi01 Same, i got a few okay things but really not too good stuff
same here
and some shields
We listen to Wrek's Viking playlist?
Been running?
DerpyMuffins - i would describe it as "Klingon," but it's roughly the same, isn't it?
His MegaMetal playlist to be exact.
playing PIU
Viking playlist? That's an interesting way of describing it
I'll just pretend I know what that is.
lol thanks to Wrek I just remembered, I used this song in my WW1 presentation for Social Studies :P
lol
Kandarihu - but no less accurate
hmm?
Your history doesnt expand back for thousand of years
oh, on the contrary
we're a melting pot
we have history EVERYWHERE
it's like a family tree
Meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHtAljhEI0&feature=player_detailpage#t=33s
History, history everywhere!
that honestly the first time ive seen someone post "stop fucking my pony, seriously!"
"My father is from Germany" *append German history"
"Well mine was African" *append African history*
The more you know.
So basically DDR's foreign cousin.
Yea well Im English-French so its double the history for me
so basicly DDR big brother
DerpyMuffins - and the funny thing is that when we get taught history, we're effectively being taught British History right up until the 1600s-ish
way harder too
Just me or did chat die?
more or less
napping
no
napping, yeah
chat is old
I have no idea what you guys were talkinga bout, so I didn't say anything.
Everlasting_Joy - half the times we don't even know what we're talking about
Hey guys, what kind of music would Spike listen to
/me laughs maniacally at DerpyMuffins' expense.
?
it's amazing how many tangents a conversation can go
MirrorImage: :D.
MirrorImage: Isn't it?
we can go from "Which is better, Apples or Oranges" to Godwins Law in about 5 minutes if we really tried
i want a tangerine
although in fairness, *that* might be a loaded situation
Just letting you know, I'm napping. :D
Kinixys: Toddler tunes? Considering he's not that old
MirrorImage: Only Nazi's would bring up oranges.
/me is eating a tangerine <.<
/me is eating Ice Cream
*win*
/me steals p4ngya's tangerine
nuuuuuuuu
/me replaces said tangerine with a lemon :)
hmm
/me is okay with this
rhubarb is also good
CiderIsForDrinking: Really? He doesn't ACT that young. How about jazz?
DDR is most know in Europe while PIU is more famous in mexico and japan for some reason
^
Kinixys: Jazz would probably fit him
in about 2 steps
MirrorImage: I know :).
> More famous than DDR
> Japan

Oh my goodness.
So beautiful.
VenHur - that's what Tumblr is for
That is awesome
Wrek: ♥Nice♥
NO! Die in a hole you damn lag!!!
Who are they?
Wrek, you put so much detail into your art, even the little things. So wonderful.

deal with it that's as far as recent years, the reason why DDR is still most know in japan is because it made by konami

Has anyone done a Kirby and MLP crossover?

Rustymeat: can't rush perfection.
wrek is doing something
its called k-swag
what are we? Rule 85? If it exists, it has been ponified?
not true it's paid by otakon neighbor
that roughly extends to crossovers
Sumica: He inhaled Diamond Tiara.
MirrorImage: that would be rule 2010 you are thinking of or rule 34.2
But it's free for me and that's all that counts.
MirrorImage: if it exists it will be ponified is rule 34.2
Damn
00,10I thought it was 34-p
They really do Ponify everything
Theres My Little Disney
Drug addicts also think that inhaling is magic
00,10ponifie ponies
Poni
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: No, they inhale magic.
Everlasting_Joy: Yep...
Given enough lifespan, the fandom will ponify everything under the stars.

13i always thought dent was unbuckling to get out of the car, but then the shot changes without showing him getting out
pinkiespice: i dont watch dr who anyway lol
Ah.
Ive recently had a desire to play final fantasy NES
Honestly I think Dent has been wanting to die the whole time he is doing this crap.
time is the biggest key to change the world
I watched a whole playthrough of the game on youtube, it looks fun but real hard
that or a keyblade :I
o.o
I figured the biggest key is the one used to turn Big Ben.
secret santa xd
13unless you're in the center, you in the back won't be the one flying through a windshield without seatbelt
it must be, i cant be in a car without one
I never even knew there was an ff nes game
but you still risk being ejected
really?
But dont you have an nes?
i want!
no seatbelt is more unsafe in nearly all instances
yeah, but I don't really have that many games
anyway whatever, roadsafety is boring
what games do you have for it?

Everyone agreed to counter-troll how Tara normally is by staying quiet when she walked into the panel. Then she has a cosplay on. She counter-trolled the counter-troll
jffry890: heck yeah we are!
Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is best fear.

11,02Lunar_Brony: A lot of today's 'new-style' kids shows focus on idiotic comedy because they're easy to do and nets them the most popularity rather than meaningful content mixed in with some thought-out humor.
ShadowQuill: that is actully not true
its loony tunes
ShadowQuill: i do love MLP but Doctor is beter

NewSuperBronyU therefore we should blame lazy writers and creators. What about shows that just don't have a meaning of existence? I can name quite a few off the top of my head, and they don't even try to be funny with meaningless humour
twilight_sprinkle: I think I lost a couple of IQ points there.
Shizuka: who are thoes ponys
NewSuperBronyU: MOOOOO
lol twilight_sprinkle
This generation is physically HURTING me
Mooooooo
NewSuperBronyU: mooooooooooooooo
Scottish-geeky: Shizu and Vivi.
Mooooooooooo
AJIsAwesome: yeeeees, my brilliant plan to dumb down the entire world is working!

Lunar_Brony: damn...well i guess ill just start an experiment to see if negative iq is possible then!
Lunar_Brony: OKAY BREAK IT UP! We don't want a war like last time!
AJIsAwesome it's a bucking muffin! Do you have reflexes?
Lunar_Brony: Not on the internet. :(
And that's why Ace Attorney works

ShadowQuill wha-who-why-WHAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?
Lunar_Brony: If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
my parents don't appreciate old technology as much as me. They wanted to sell my Gamecube. I practically lectured them on how much it meant to me
Now I have a gold brick worth 20 grand and I hid it in my house.
Life's insane.

That's not very nice! I'm not insane!

OH, LIFE! I never said you were insane!
I still have a PM tab open
Lunar_Brony: Sneaky sneaky...
Lunar_Brony: BUT HOW
why is there no emote for rolling your eyes?
Because that would give you the power of sarcasm

/me and slaps Meanwhile
Lunar_Brony I don't know who you are at all so I'm just going to a wild guess and assume you're a spazz.
don't worry meanwhile, i support you
I don't need support but I appreciate it nonetheless.
Meanwhile I'm Canadian_Brony, Science_Brony, and Zombie_Brony. I have 4 aliases. We got tied together by SB about a month back
Oh so I was right. You're a spazz
you didn't exactly enjoy it
Guess I win some point.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051205.jpg
Meanwhile I'm not a spazz. I'm insane
Meanwhile: If your brother annoyed you, would you throw him out of the house with no resources left to fend on his own?
there IS a difference!
No you're a spazz.
prove it
11,02You're supposed to let it charge up Buytoast :/
Don't need to, everything you type spells it out pretty well.
example?
Claiming to be insane, that's something a spazz would do.
define "spazz"
Because you think you're just so out of line with the norm that you must be special.
When in reality you're just like a lot of people, namely the rest of the spazz community.
I kinda half to agree with Lunar_Brony
have*
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051226.jpg
Meanwhile: whatever
we're all insane here, there is no such thing as "normal", and I like to throw muffins
half is fifty percent of something.
man i have no idea how wario works
half, 50%, 1/2, all the same
Laurayne: I love that last panel. :D
See at least he understands that.
"he" has a name
As far as I care your name is mud.
Me Too AJIsAwesome
what do you mean by "he"
The spazz.
Meanwhile I am aware that "mud" spelled backwards is "dum". I have taste in what I watch
11,02gg :)
WHAT\
I didn't know it had two z's.
gg
neither did I
and what does gg mean
good game
rising: Good game
Well now you do, consider yourself somewhat more educated.
oh okay then
The more you know! ~*
whatever
also, I'm not entirely sure who Meanwhile is referring to. I almost completely lost interest in the conversation and I'm only replying to keep him entertainee
*entertained
why do i predict flutterchu wont come in weeks
I'm not even sure if he's being entertained
We should be so lucky.

Thousand Year Door
/)^3^(\
i hear that meanwhile
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060206.jpg
Laurayne :D
I used to be entertained being here but then a mass influx of stupid hit it.
NewSuperBronyU: how far are you?
pfft, who watched the intro amiright?
so you all said that you like flutterchu when caramel told her/hm to leave, but you all secretly hate him/her
I used to talk to much in here, then I got lurker'd.
i never said i liked anyone
O_________O
I don't know if EVERYONE hates flutterchu, but I do.
ah im on the second crystal star :
and frankly the guy doesn't know when to quit
:)
you've got a loooooooong way to got bro
I'm already inside the door on my second
It's hard to enjoy anything when there're people you hate all over the place.
11,02I beat this game twice so far :)
God I know that feel.
^\
-_(\
Meanwhile: you know flutterchu's a bit emotioal i predict you just caused him/her a sucide
rising: then I consider my good deed for the day accomplished.
sucks to be you, Meanwhile.
Look, I have to put this out. For people who may not know, flutterchu has been known for spamming quotes, "attention grabbing" and various other things. I have to admit, those things are VERY annoying to me when it's done xcessively, but I don't hate him. I just wish he'd stop and realize what he's doing is a bit too much.
... -_(\
he won't stop and realize
that's the issue
I know it does twilight_sprinkle, I'm me.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060314.jpg Something Similar Happened To Me With This Movie
sounds like me in my early days of the chat room
AJIsAwesome tbh i think the fellow is a bit, well, not to offennd, but autistic
he seems to always be in his world
So flutterchu is a twat, glad we could sort that out.
twilight_sprinkle: what do you mean by autistic
one sec i need to refresh
im waiting
what i mean is that hes always saying things completely unrelated to anyhting going on, and his replies make no sense
11,02Cut out all the hate everypony :(
that defenitely sounds like me in my early days of the chat room
k
Maybe we should drop this before it gets out of hand. :S
i just think hes a bit nutty, so not really a bad person, just a bit, nutty
He's a twonk.
SB laid the law already
twilight_sprinkle: i dont think he's not stopping and realizing
now have a muffin
NewSuperBronyU: im not hating, to the contrary im defending him, in fact i already prevented him getting banned once
/me throws a muffin into the chat
NewSuperBronyU: No stylish moves?
twilight_sprinkle: I think he/her trying to make everyone realize
man, you gotta have STYLE
STYLE is everything!
You prevented him getting banned? What'd you do that for? Could've cleaned chat up a bit.
LOVE the music in this game.
because i rarely want anyone to get banned
and there we go
STYLE
twilight_sprinkle: i dot see your name as the staff
and like i said, i dont think he understands what hes doing, so i cant hate him for being annoying unintentionally
Because he's not staff.
man, you are not good at paper mario: TTYD unless you can defeat bonetail as a level 1
rising: doesnt mean i cant argue with them.
how did he get so many items?
rising: he doesn't have to be part of the staff to defend his opinions. :S
^
11,02Lunar_Brony: Bought them before the Bandit could steal my coins :P
NewSuperBronyU
i dont really care whos staff or not, i'll express my opinion the same
On here though you do have to be part of the staff to not get kicked for it.
dont you argue to him/her to stop tattle tailing AJIsAwesome
NewSuperBronyU: Did you find the bandiT?
NewSuperBronyU nice
11,02AJIsAwesome: Ran in to me in the beginning :)
NewSuperBronyU: you cannot call yourself good at this game unless you can kill bonetail while at level 1
:V
NewSuperBronyU: Okay. :0
*:)
11,02Okie, then I'm not good at this game \:3/
AJIsAwesome the bandit will ALWAYS steal half your coins
and YES it is possible
Lunar_Brony: I know. :P
also Lunar_Brony still annoys me
GET BACK EHRE YOU LITTLE LIGHTBULB HEADED SLUG
Lunar_Brony: Just asking if he FOUnd him, that's all.
*FOUND
NewSuperBronyU that's why you have the chat to assisst you decision making, but still allowing you to have your own opinion based on personal strategies, skills, and reflexes
Oh lawdy. It's getting personal in here too. -_-
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060529.jpg
NewSuperBronyU: just wait until you try the 100 pit trials
So does Laurayne ever actually say anything or just link to a mediocre webcomic?
Meanwhile: if you cant ignore ponies chat why dont you just go on a diffrent server if all youre gonna do is insult them and not ignore them
so far it's just been links
I Talk :(

^^
^^^
^^^^
C-c-c-c-combo breaker.
I've been here for over a year rising I'm not about to leave just because it happens to have gotten particularly stupid in here.
ah yes, the black key that opens the black chest containing the thing that "curses" you
you have to go through the same process 4 times
Lunar_Brony...
I still wish I got here sooner.
Isn't there a theory that the chests are actually the [need Bronystate gold to view this]
sooo what's on stream ?
11,02OH NOES
the same damn key and the same damn chest and the same damn taunting and the same damn music . . . is slightly catchy tbh
i do like this music
Paper Mario I think TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
11,02A CURSE D:
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door.
Oh no it's a sentient jack o'lantern face.
Ninjazz: you didn'ty miss much, the only thing you didn't miss is the fact that Lunar_Brony wont quit talking so much :V
Ninjazz: yea, you are correct ^_^
Meanwhile: who cares if youve been here for a year flutterchu has been here for a year too
Derpy_Hooves, lol.
Derpy_Hooves sorry :(
rising: Pfft, my ass he has.
Meanwhile: T_T
NocturnalBlade, for once I am. :D
rising: Actualy, he hasn't. He's only been here for a little while.
flutterchu hasn't been here for a year
^
"cursed"
get your facts straight
Lunar_Brony: well the only reason im saying that is the first impression you gave me annoyed me
Flutterchu has been here for a month or two at best.
flutterchu says hes been here since a long time ago, but was in ban
Derpy_Hooves I have been known to give lousy first impressions
Lunar_Brony: Probably because you're a spazz.
one of these days . . .
twilight_sprinkle: I still wish he'd straigten up, it would suck to see him banned, IMO.
*straighten
Hmmm.
Not bad.
ha
AJIsAwesome: well if i'm right about him being, yknow, then its kinda doubtful, but ive tried to straighten him ot. ill try some more maybe
fanceh flying there SB
I LOVE The music in this area.
AJIsAwesome: if you listended to his/her chat's he/she said i havnt touched a computer all summer i went on a LONG vacation and im afraid i wont see ponies anymore im scared :'( id liek to thank (replies to everyone...INLUDING YOU) for making me have a nice life here on bronystate i might be back here in agust
SO ambient.
11,02Lunar_Brony: Thanks :3
Meanwhile
Derpy_Hooves.
i can end this
rising is flutterchu
rising: Okay. I hope you had a good time here and I hope you come back soon. :(
but I've done better. Ever flown from the top balcony in Hooktail's castle to the other top balcony? Not easy, but DAMN cool to look at
the ip's match
And so rising was flutterchu. I ish shocked.
HAaaaahahahahaahah
WAit, what?
im not flutterchu
what?
yes you are
T_T
wut
no
im not
Ah he's right!
The IP does match!
Derpy_Hooves say something that isn't obvious
Hmm, interesting.
SHITFUCK
Meanwhile even i got that one
ah, i Thought he had a alterego in here
RQ.
Oh man you just made my day.
rising: So you've been lying.:|
Wait.
Meanwhile, you didn't know already?
Nah I just thought rising was some newb.
Ahahahaha.
Meanwhile flutterchu (kxdtjlhvpe@lc27-2-196-676.oc.oc.cox.net) has joined #bronystate rising (kxdtjlhvpe@lc27-2-196-676.oc.oc.cox.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
I couldn't care less
I guess technically I was right.
You've lost ALL my respect (if I had any) of you, flutterchu. That's pathetic.
also passed by teardrop for a while
wait, so he actually changed his name to talk about himself?
DOWNRIGHT SAD.
oh man
this is spectacular
I don't monitor the join/quit feed Derpy_Hooves, I only watch name changes.
well he joined under the name rising
It was still pretty obvious. :p
yeah i suspected he lurked around after he said things he shouldnt have known after leaving
Pfft, fair enough.
AJIsAwesome is angry, Meanwhile and Buytoast are amused, I'm laughing my ass off at the chat's reactions
Meanwhile want me to warn you next time or just leave you in the blue until the person leaves so you can laugh later ?
Lunar_Brony: I'm not angry, just disappointed.
and not one fuck was given that day!
Ah I don't mind whichever T.
Ah Meanwhile DGAS anyways. I wouldn't.
k
Lunar_Brony: but you just described that plenty of them were given
twilight_sprinkle . . . shut up
:<
Lunar_Brony: Thought he would change, but he didn't. HOW SAD. Even gave him a chance and turned it down.
Heh
AJIsAwesome: que?
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060918.jpg
Insert rolled eyes here.
Derpy_Hooves: flutterchu.
what about him?
also, cant tell if flutterchu is insane, or more clever than i thought
Ah that was funny.
Lol. Just wants attention.
Takes alot to be legit insane.
twilight_sprinkle I'd say he's sane
although him lurking after leaving was obvious, but still, he acts completely different on his other acc
And even more to be clever.
just sayin'
Derpy_Hooves: Were you paying attention?
nope :V
ummm, wow i just noticed that its 4 in the morning XD
it's a long story
AJIsAwesome will tell you it!
Still looking for artists on that collab picture thingymabob Derpy_Hooves?
i wonder if hes still lurking though
/me pulls up a beanbag chair "yay story time~"
right? *winkwink nudgenudge*
He could be anonpony.
prolly not, or the iris people wouldve seen
Meanwhile :V
Random question Derpy_Hooves is hard to manage twentypercentcooler or it's just like one big data base ?
how'd ya guess?
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Just taking a stab in the dark with a spatula.
that is something you want to ask pinkie
wut?
I should check 20%cooler more often.
mmmm k
who?
HELP?!?!?
Lunar_Brony: What will I tell?
EVERYTHING!!!!!
I feel lost!!!
well i think i will be off to bed, this chat has confused me enough for one night XD
g'night NocturnalBlade
night NocturnalBlade
11,02Night NocturnalBlade :)
NIght, NocturnalBlade :)

Lunar_Brony: Were you even paying attention?
11,02Np :)
Urgh, only like an hour and I can go to sleep.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Lunar_Brony: Did you listen to my explanation? :S
Derpy_Hooves
AJIsAwesome I was trying, but I forgot to stock the fridge and my mind is running on half a cylinadr
want me to show you what i do?
Lunar_Brony: Oh, okay.
Derpy_Hooves . . . sure. That sounds like a good start
Lunar_Brony: Basically, rising turned out to be flutterchu and left.
i'm guessing mod on the forums part ?
That thing's kind of soggy...
AJIsAwesome I got that part
whack the soggy thing with your hammer
11,02I FIGURED IT OUT :D
Also, why does that thing look like a giant sperm.
touch it
touch it hard
or stomp on it
Lunar_Brony: Then what are you asking about?
AJIsAwesome I dunno anymore
Lunar_Brony: You do. You just can't remember it right now.
remember what?
Lunar_Brony: What you wanted to ask me about. What you wanted me to tell.
http://twentypercentcooler.net/tickets ,

DAT FIRE FLOWER
BINGO!!
YAHTZEE!!

That was probably the lamest giant squid fight I have ever seen in a videogame.
11,02CHAPTER 2 :D
11,021* ><
Lunar_Brony you seem to get lost in a convo quite easily
my brain is running on half a cyilandar atm
Lunar_Brony then i recommend sleep
pfft, sleep is for the weak
Amen.
/me is weak
Stupid chat derped on me.
you don't need sleep
just get some vittles and you'll be fine
SB just can't nail platforming. Or he's trying to kill himself
welp
he killed himself
and I'm not sure why
Me, neither. :D
because he can ?
NewSuperBronyU: is making me want to go play paper mario :3
11,02:3

You got a mushroom, time to get high.

twilight_sprinkle Bronystate and Whose Line
11,02Meanwhile: O U :P
twilight_sprinkle: I know EXACTLY how you feel. :D
^
Lunar_Brony: yeah i also killed a bit of time on the pre-alpha legends of equestria demo
off to go get second crystal star :3
ha, I'm in the door
11,02No spoilers please :)

NewSuperBronyU: have you beat this game before?
Knock knock knock on wood.
DAT BADGE
IIRC

/me hasn't beaten Thousand Year Door
/me is ashamed
11,02Awesome game \:3/
^
Lunar_Brony: What are you stuck on?
i almost 100% the game, just was missing a few tattles
AJIsAwesome one of the bosses in the door. Won't say his name because A) no spoilers and B) I can't remember his name
ooh, that smarts
SPOILER: You are paper
Lunar_Brony: Does he pop out of something?
AJIsAwesome he's big, black, and similar to the Chapter 1 boss
hope that's enough
Lunar_Brony: Ok.
poor tree ;__;
Why are you hammering the tree? :S
STOP.
11,02Moo :3
..
Um.....okay.
EPA will hunt you NewSuperBronyU for beating trees
ah, still need to beat Super Mario Sunshine :<
some level are buckin hard :<
^
the only non FLUDD level rthat was a pain was the sand bird
^
AJIsAwesome Corona Mountain was . . . meh. The final boss was just fun
Corona Mountain wasn't that hard if you jsut used short controlled bursts
True.
now that little village with the lava and the chain chomps and shit
fuck that place
anypony know how much shine sprites in total you have to collect?
Buytoast agreed
11,02120
i think there's like 120 total
yeah
Yep, 120.
120 to rap it
I think it's only 80 to beat it
And the ending for 120 is NOT worth it, IMO.
I won't say anything because spoilers.
i needi need 25 more
ah
sb wants to kill All the bystanders
you know what game you do need
Luigi's mansion
YES
That game is amazing.
I remember being stuck early on in the island amusement park. Literally chased down Shadow Mario back-to-back for Yoshi and the two nozels
Buytoast FUCK YEAH
Still haven't found everything yet.
shit, a few months ago my dad opened an old storage locker we were using
i found a bin of my old shit
there was a strategy guide for luigi'sansion in there
ah whole site derped on me :<
those exist?
wish i knew where it went off to
told you where all the gold mice were and crap
my luigi's mansion broke ;__;
along with ssbm
D:
Still have to catch those STUPID speedy ghosts. :|
Wait.
AJIsAwesome: who ya gonna call
Melee doesn't work?
MELEE?
yup
Damn it.
man, i'm glad i know my little rinky dink video game store
they're selling melee for 5-10 dollars
Nice.
got a few copies in there
and ssbm still sells it at around $20
or more
hell, they're selling an unopened conker's bad fur day for the n64 too
Sweet.
the only game stores around here are EB Games, and both stores cleared their inventory of Gamecube stuff a month ago
of course, they're charging 50 bucks for it
That game's fantastic.
I"m pissed 'cause I'm trying to find NFS: Most Wanted fo the Gamecube
NFS: Carbon was the last game i ever bought
found all my n64 wires, controls, and games... but i cant find the console :<
last I bought was Mario Kart 7
11,02That koopa is obsessed with Peach O.O
Yep. :D
future bowser
Lunar_Brony: How is MK7?
dem french..
This guy is.........interesting.
dat product placement
ah nintendo, advertising their stuff inside their stuff
I actually rage quitted on Fire Emblem because I wasn't doing the mission right. :D
*Fire Emblem once
AJIsAwesome MK7 is BUCKING AWESOME!!! Car customization, 16 characters, 32 tracks, amazing controls, and online is smooth and fast. Not a hiccup, lag, or sudden disconection so far
Lunar_Brony: Nice.
I have nothing negative to say about it
MK7?
Was considering getting another 3DS game.
other than the lack of GC levels
2
that's it
mortal kombat 7 :3
2 from Double Dash
ah k
You can only play Kid Icarus Uprising for so long.
i only played tekken
v
twilight_sprinkle: no we are actually talking aboot mario kart 7 :D
. . .
:<
speaking of Double Dash . . . only now do I see it.
I actually prefer Double Dash over 64.
Had much more fun with DD.
^
64 may be nostalgic, but I hate its controls.
Well i have to get up in a few hours may as well get some sleep, Goodnight everyone, Thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU

Ninja'd B)
I remember when I would perch in my cloud
and snipe fools that thought they could post faster than me~
What?
those were the days~
-lol
LOL
Hahahahahaha!
I get it..
then +k came in and ruined my kill streak
+k? kick bot?
Also rain what happened to kirz?
I dont see his name on the mode list thingy up there with th @ anymore
no +k = you cant post exactly what the person before you posted
Ah
he is not a mod anymore
Why not?
/me shrugs
He resigned as well???
I think so, yeah
who else resigned?
11,02There we go :)
Were losing them left and right... sigh
silver screen

;^;
sound seems off?
so thats what serious buisness meant when my bf said it
Eeyup.
11,02Sound is off?
Speaking of!
Rain: Why dont you apply for a mod position :3
^sounds higher than usual
i think
Rain: Youve got the attitude thats for sure >:3
or i'm suffering sleep depriviation
I did once
long ago
Rain: Really? So how was it being a mod?
I never was one ^_^
Rain: I imagine like getting kissed by celestia
with a mouth full of scotch
my application got thrown out before it ever reached the mods for voting ^_^
Rain: Ehhh.....Why???
Were ya' being a deliquent? :3
because things were going down and the lead admin decided it would just be awkward if I became a mod
Ehhhh......Thats kind of a dream killer I suppose.
In my honest opinion.
/me shrugs
Brutally honest.
I hate evrything about the idea of moderatirs
Not sure why...
/me shrugs
Maybe its cause i just hate authority :3
Meh
watching my boy friend has taught me that Im kinda glad I didnt become a mod
-lol why so?
i dont deserve to be said hi at anymore
too much hassle?
flutterchu: AHHH! yes ya do! :3
Rain: Ha! I can see how that would happen.
Rain: Well if your not willing to take the hits you cant give em' out. As it were said.
indeed
Well
for all its worth
so instead of moderating
I think you would have been a great mod :3
I kinda act like a ninja mod
-lol dishing out that rain brand of bronystate street justice?
i can tell no one wants me here anymore for spotting me spying on them
flutterchu: I dont mind you :3
Mega_Milk: T_T
flutterchu: Now bro hoof me boy /)

Mega_Milk and I are just having a conversation ^_^
Tis true

Rain: caramel and meanwhile and i got caught spying on bronystate
Rain: Thats why I thought if anyone youd make a great addition to the staff.
I spy on bs all the time, flutterchu
Rain: You've been around a lot longer. So youve got senority. And your pretty non biased when it comes to deliberating on things.
I've gotten so good at it people dont even realize it
Rain: not like i did
-lol
I always knwo rain i shere

flutterchu: Your my best friend cause i said so yo >:3
Mega_Milk: huh? i dont even know yo

11,02I'm a moo o.o
NewSuperBronyU: And me sir. I am milk ._.
you guys treat me like teardrop (cant talk) "well choose teardrop" "why her" "she's my best freind" "how do you know that" "she was the only one that hasnt said she hates me"
flutterchu: Well ill make it simpler.
flutterchu: Do you want me to hate you?
also, I have no qualms about my bf being named >w>
Mega_Milk: i beleve that's how everyone wants to treat my liek secretly
pfft
Rain: Thats good. Your pleasure moans "With his name included" Will make the drawing oh so much better.
I have no reason to hate you so I dont hate you ^_^
flutterchu: Well I dont wanna hate anyone.
But your damn right I do -lol

CrazyCherry: Luck hates you.
So I scrolled up a bit.
Silver dropped too?
Ninjazz: Eeyup.

Yeah
Hes going to cllege

Mmmm. Thank goodness it's only that then. Shame though.
So he dropped

And people have told you that already. -_-
Mega_Milk, best wished to him. ^_^
eeyup.
Only mod that has Rarity as favorite gone. T_T
Ninjazz: Honestly. I liked rarity.
But her drama keeps me at an emotional distance
Mega_Milk, she is my absolute favorite.
rarty makes a perfect princesstard
Rarity is my fav

So I switched to AJ
Ninjazz: I know.

G'day everypony
Tiberium126: Sup mate.
Hey Tiberium126.

You have arrived at a grim hour Tiberium126
I mayk bess shet
meh, xbrony360 is still better thanXBU
AdamTheDuck, :'(

14,1 While I may be the best system, I dont mind that people like other systems more. I will just continue being awesome and supportive of my fan base. ^_^
flutterchu: a what now?
09,03More Call of Duty timed exclusives for Xbox! Great timing, just bought an 'MW3' Tee for my Avatar. I think I'm going to post it on Facebook to show everyone else.
AdamTheDuck, whats so grim?
Lol.
Micwosoff?
LOL!
Dem colors.
someone really doesnt know sony
Dark_Horst: Battle For Dream Island
Make it stop ;^; Make the madness stop >.<
Tiberium126, the day NewSuperBronyU transformed into XBrony360. .-.
no idea what that is
"Supportive of my fan base" are you god damn BLIND
Dark_Horst: a youtube series
Dark_Horst: you should watch it
no one knows who I am?
XBrony360, that one kinda hurt.
:/
scumbag sony releases a smaller model with cheaper hardware and charges more
somewhere Our Superbrony64 is alone. And cold. And muffin-less ;^;
k
eei like playstation and i know they are terrible with their fans
scumbag sony adds to the EULA so you can't sue them
scumbag sony probably SOLD that account information
scumbag sony takes away the best feature of the hardware
AdamTheDuck, lol. I dont care for PS3 or 360, they do all the same
Whoa guys.
Scumbag Microsoft is stupid >.>
takes away best features?
It's a business decision.
it was a business decision
made by idiots
SuperSony65: nuuu! you are an imposter! >.>
So really
what did I wake up to?
this whole discussion is invalid anyway becasue everybody know that PC is best platform
09,03Dumb Wii fanboys, waving plastic toys around. I think I'll stay here in the future of gaming while driving my car in the game with nothing but my hands!
That SuperSony65 is a spai!~
You still get amazing games, a great system, and soon you'll get the amazing new console that's still in the works. :)
oh god
lol XBrony360 : haha
So just go out and buy another PS3! :D
someone tell me please
:/
XBrony360 yeah, cause the wii motion controls are "So good"
Panda: Sb refuses to go back to being Superbrony64
cmon pc, lets get outa here, this is getting retarded
What the hell you guys do to him now Mega_Milk XD
Hey, XBrony360! Hey, XBrony360! You're not as good as me. :I
XBrony360, Sounds like you love the xbox now.
/me picks up pc and walks to the quiet area of chat
its not like developers have to hack the motion controls in games to make them LOOK like they are working
/me sets 1000000000000 Wii's on fire.
Panda: Nothing he just said superbrony64 is gone forever ;^; but we wants him back ;^;
IS SOMEONE ACTING...
Oh random ep stream
ENTITLED?
...
09,03Just bought Kinectimals, I feel like there's a tiger living right in my living room. I made it do a trick! That's going on my Facebook wall...God...I'm sure to become the Gamer Spotlight for sure now!
TF2 in a nutshell
Mega_Milk :/
scootloo was flying
actually, kinectimals IS pretty cute
but i wish there was a pony version
SB, its time for sleep. its 3:30 am.
EVERYPONY'S THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTED
also, god damn the hair in that game is georgious
scootloo CAN fly
XBrony360: then have fun with your tiger! and your Lies! ;^;
Heard of that great new Sony Move? It's like having all the motion of actual playing the palms in your hands. Top precision! Another must have for gamers. :)
Is this the first ep that SuperX360PS3Brony64U is running, or did I miss another?
Wait a second....
09,03The new Xbox 360 racing wheel is awesome! Tried it out with Forza 4 and the cars...
J_E_Smith71: ou missed one.
TAKE THAT
Dang, which one?
worth mIRC crashing
*investigation concerned music*
XBrony360: Mario kart had a wheel.....;^;
XSuperPS360Brony64?
euch forza was ruined by the car manufactures
Crashing? Get a PS3! It never crashes! :D
Rain D: help me!
theres a full damage model in that game
Panda: It's a joke of course
11,02..help...
XBrony360, and the wheeled controller for PC were good as well
how so Chrysalis ?
Xbox live, its like paying a tax but so is everything else in this world
what's wrong, Panda?
J_E_Smith71 i know :)
but the manufacturers wouldnt liscence the cars with it on
So what ep did he play before?
XBrony360, the xbox360 didn't invent the wheel controller
they didnt?
J_E_Smith71: The episode were they do the foal free express.
Rain, we need to bring SB back to the side of Nintendo. He must frollic in the hours of wasted lives and grandeur of the remade games that use remedial programming!
J_E_Smith71: Cant remember the specific episdoe name.
09,03...The cars really looked super awesome and the controls felt like I was really there!
no, d3rb, they didnt
but.....they told me they did ;_;
the wheel controller has been around for a loooong time
^
YOU'RE NOT MY FAVORITE SUPERBRONY64
since atari XD
well at least XBrony360 has stopped with the sarcasm
why would they lie...right to my face ;_;
d3rb, LOL where did you find that out?
My first wheel was for ps2 and it was for need for speed.
I remember one controller for the PC. it was a wheel
and why am I watching a slideshow
and gas peddle
My second was for mario kart wii
and brake
Tiberium126, i had a mad catz wheel for ps1 :P
and my last was for 360
Normally I wouldn't be here at this hour, but I woke up earlier and noticed I forgot to shut the computer off. I come over and see random episode playing
and gear shifter
If you still have one of our fine PS2's, you should get an EyeToy. :)
Great fun for the whole family! :D
09,03I am Xbox. I am everything. I will not fall. I will not be second. I am pure.
I do actually have an eye toy.
pure crap :p
J_E_Smith71, you should stay and watch
ok... I have my water and I'm going back to sleep. Night night again ponies. and SB, if you dont come out... no Denny's tonight!
wait Panda
It was fun till you realized all the games sucked -lol
XBrony360, WiiU will still be superior
check skype, Panda
Wii has better games
give it time, XBrony360 will RROD soon then we can reset him
09,03D-Dennys?
Tiberium126: It's 6:30 AM here. Normally I'm still asleep
SB, Denny's
J_E_Smith71, I was up for 48 hours before
11,02Can I get a Grand Slam...?
08,01i should stream Shaun the Sheep at some point
09,03SHUT UP YOU FOOL

SB, even better, you can have a grand slam with extra pancakes and a side of french toast.
dennys is awesome
11,02i liek dennys though...
08,01remember when people say "they don't make children's programmes like they used to?"

Dennys is pretty great -lol
XBrony360, you're a....silly filly

08,01despite being a wonderbolt
I feel the same about Mac
and Brae is a total dom
08,01true
XD
08,01i can't imagine Soarin being dominant with Braeburn
pg13 can not contain our awesome!
08,01Panda|Sleepies: *now* you're talkin'!

Klingon Style?
Hey Phase4 can you play a video for me? :3
00,02AdamTheDuck, sure
Phase4, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHOVRhN5yTA
Sorry, I was trying to get chat and video to load awhile back. As soon as I refreshed the page, I heard the message chime and saw yellow text for a moment. Who was texting me?
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktDbFe-3l48 this is the official reupload
dat guinen
....least i think that'S how her an,e is spelled
Is he speaking Klingon? Because most of the Korean lyrics are the kinds of stuff that have NO translation into the Klingon language.
um?
its klingon
00,02Zia, thx
sounds like it, at least
00,02Kandarihu|Birthday, its klingon, there are translations on youtube
/me wished he spent the time to watch Star Trek :<
00,02my spell-checker doesn't have 'klingon'
well that was usefull
Kandarihu|Birthday: First you ntranslate it intoEnglish, Then into klingon.
AdamTheDuck, I have only watched the NG
CrazyCherry, but the Klingong language only has words that pertain to war and space travel.
00,02oppa science style
00,02Ordinalthrone, aus bronys /)
Oppa Bill Nye Style
Dat ass
Inertia is a property of style.
Zia, lol
/me licks Ordinalthrone
klingon is the most fleshed out sci fi language ever. they crammed a whole bunch of linguists into a room and locked the door
Phase4, going to the Bronycon in 2013?
when they were let out again, they had come up with a language that can actually be spoken and understood in daily life
well, if you know klingon
Lol my stream stoped on dat ass
me too
stopped*
nice place to stop, sint it?
dat ass
and look! there'S SCIENCE!
By the way, it's my Birthday today

oh hey, gta4. the game that is as rescource-friendly as an angry pyrotechnician
._.

bye flutterchu
00,02Dark_Horst, eyup
looks quite amusing
futterchu, see ya
Sydney is 3 days by car :(
phil's a bit putta shape
*outta
00,02Tiberium126, that assumes ownership of a car
lol XD
fun fact: pikachu's LOVE kethup
Phase4, yer sucks being 16
00,02tbh i can probably get a car for 2 or so weeks but don't have a licence
00,02Tiberium126, i'm 19 :P
the 4 horses on this Arch looked like the Brandenburger Tor
Phase4, heeheeheheh
Uhhhh cbf getting my L's lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEXZdvHptWg
Negative friction
00,02got my L's bout a week after i was legally able to
00,02aced the test thing
00,02then NEVER drove
Lil_B thanks for making me membering that I can just get a pony to sdyney
00,02got like 5 of 120 hours
remembering*
c
J/K
Yeah I usually just end up using public transport to get to where ever
Tiberium126 no problem ... how did I do this?
oh, the irony
Phase4, got my L but dont drive that much
Lil_B, saying horses
XD
00,02at this rate my L's will expire before i get enough time
What's causing the flying cars?
00,02pony_6396, negative wheel friction
I got a Non-Driver's ID
Heh. Funny.
Phase4, on my test I got 30/30. I think they make it to easy
This game needs to apply the negative friction to shoes. EVERYONE FLYING AROUND
total mayhem. love it
00,0229/30, i got the 'by how much is your risk of having an accident reduced after 120 hours of experience' question wrong
00,02and only that question
00,02its a bizarre bullshit question
yeah
especially as it should go up
not down
as people get complacant
Hi everypony :D
Got my moped card with two points off. ._.
https://www.service.transport.qld.gov.au/rrtexternal/SelectExam.jsp
It goes up because you don't have a supervisor anymore... Damn trick questions. :P
Thats all I used
00,02Chrysalis, the idea is those 120 hours are spent with an instructor, but anyone with a licence is legally able to instruct
brodash, G'day
00,02and there are a lot of morons out there with licences teaching other morons
00,02thus the chinese wisper of driving knowledge continues
Phase4, The teenagers in this world a very sad.
did anyone watch the nrl grand final?
00,02brodashX, ANOTHER AUSSIE!
/me 00,02hugs brodashX Tiberium126 AdamTheDuck and Ordinalthrone

May I asked what you studied exactly in Australian english Lil_B? I mean you could study it in a linguistics sense, but the way you make it sound it's like you're studying another language ._.
eeyup
So guys, anyone excited about Halloween? :D I want more horror movies
d3rb, Just waiting on LABOUR to do that
i speak jibberish
^
MadSurge, shall we all vote for Alien for Movie Night? :D
that was played too recently
good idea adam
Really? Damn...
AdamTheDuck: how about The Thing? :3
...
Aliens? :3
MadSurge, ooh I got to go see that movie :3
dammit...thats a really good idea, i love that movie
AdamTheDuck actually, just different Words for a lot of things and some things like how greetings in Australia etc. ANd a lot of History and Trivia about it
Carpenter is a special effects genius
the first 3 alien movies were all shown over the summer. I don't think The Thing has been played though
FULL MOON TOMORROW
but i want to see trainspotting and tron!
a movie about cowboys and aliens would be funny
brodashX: already did :D
brodashX, class B
To be honest the effects were the only thing I liked about The Thing. The movie itself didn't impress me
Midnight_Fyre, oh God 3 was played?
damn
d3rb: only interested in Trainspotting
Aliens 3*
yep, 3 was played for the trilogy event
Ahh trilogy
MadSurge, /)
I just want to forgot I even watched 3 and 4...
Bleh, 3 was like the first only shittier and more cruel
forget*
I know how about we watch my Gopro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak?
They played the extended version of all of them. 3 did was not good enough to justify an extended version
d3rb: (\
AdamTheDuck: dat alien/human hybrid O__o
MadSurge, that was so fucked it...
Anyone want to hear about Canterlot Gardens? I was there for the first two days
*I know how about we watch my Go Pro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak for 20kg TUNA?
Midnight_Fyre, yer sure
it was awesome. Tara Strong cosplayed as Twilight
and?
Midnight_Fyre: AWESOME :D
And they brought in a bunch of non-pony actors to do a VA rwading of Boast Busters
:D
:_
:)
sounds awesomne : D
Including John DiMaggio, who voiced Trixie as Bender
how long was Canterlot Gardens?
Midnight_Fyre: HOW APPROPRIATE :D
Lil_B: Started Friday and ends today
ah :)
And Lee Tockar is now my favorite voice actor on the show. That guy is awesome
Midnight_Fyre, where was it?
Strongsville, Ohio
Lee Tockar, who did he voice?
DROP THE BASS
http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=136590
great, now there is bass all over the floor
Happy banned books week, everyone!
He's really enthusiastic and knows how to work the crowd
Twilight Sparkle won't let Sara Tailin restrict these books to a locked shelf :)
Randomnerd, I only read non-ficton
Midnight_Fyre: he's so enthusiastic about HIS BEAUTIFUL MOUSTACHE
1984 was a banned book? o_O
Fiction
The irony is strong in that one.
^^^
Hehe <3 The Catcher in the Rye
Tiberium126: Have you read the Pentagon Papers?
They're dry, but they were suppressed.
And toward the end of the day yesterday I bumped into him and we ended up having a pretty interesting talk about the stone Pinkamena carving I made and brought to show people. I made sure to show him since I had the opportunity because I know he carves stone as well
Randomnerd, I read about The 3rd reich or Nazis
Sometimes I hate youtube, sometimes I absolutely adore it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbGMeToAspk
youtube comments are worse than /b/
true
Very few books about Nazis get censored.
d3rb, uhh just learn not to scroll down. That's what I do mostly... :/
08,01what class am i?
And I had to wait in lines for 3.5 hours for Tara Strong's autograph
Consensus seems to be people should have taken "Mein Kampf" more serious when it was published :(
AdamTheDuck, i do but some are hard to avoid
08,01Midnight_Fyre: you think that's bad, Tara Strong had to sit at a table even longer, signing autographs
^
^^
do you know any bronouns?
08,01what's a bronoun?
I can only imagin Tara, in the last few autografs, crying and bleeding onto the pictures -.-
its like a brotato
or Brosidon
or a Bromato
08,01Lil_B: i'll uh, be in my bunk
or Brosif Stallin
Napoleon Bronaparte.
or Bronology
or Brodolf ... forget it
And then last night they had some live brony music. I can't remember who it was, but some guy did some really awesome blues rock
heres one I bet you didnt ever think of
Bronco
Actually the live music was one of the funnest parts, but it was also one of the most awkward because I think some guy was trying to feel up my chest at one point during the music. 6_9
bronology, the study of bro
I like that AdamTheDuck
Ohai Rain!
thats really awkward Midnight_Fyre ....
:3
08,01Lil_B: they wer fantastic! thank you so much! <3
Good moring all - some breakfast music for those just waking up :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avU5onrWfYo
hey Cypresswolf
Goodmorning Cypresswolf
Ohai Cypresswolf, breakfast music you say? :3
<3
:3 yesh
Tiberium126: confound them!
Suddenly ded chat :<
d3rb: Yeah, basically, as the night went on about half the people on the dance floor had taken off their shirts, including me, and during a slow song some guy puts his arm around my shoulder as if to start a sideways swaying line (no problem there because it wouldn't have been the first time it had happened that night), but his hand landed a bit far and low and basically cupped itself right around my nipple. awkwa
:D
Dayum dat wall o' text
mega awkward
sorry, didn't realize i had written so much
lol i've done that before
I write too much all the time :3
I'm hoping I was just imagining it
it always seems shorter when you think of what to type
Midnight_Fyre, http://derpy.me/gZnBj
Bronies/Furries UNITE!
unite for....?
AdamTheDuck: :D
d3rb, ANYTHING

Also, Pixelkitties was a really awesome artist to talk to, and she wore the "JERK" shirt from Dan Vs.

Batman meets Ponies http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3kAFfgsa4s - couldnt stay up long enough for the stream to end to post this last night
i thought about a password, then i thought, why the hell would anyone use my name?
While I'm gone, have a relaxing song everyone :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvGL63o827g
i wonder if that ever happens, people using other peoples names
If I listen to relaxing music right now I'll fall back asleep. so tired
Phase4:
you a link to something to pump you up?
actually I'm really tempted to go back to bed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ysDV9POBXE
That song hits the spot
hi giez
That reminds me of another thing. One of the musicians played a half hour tribute song to Cupcakes :O
hello JRP2234
i have to go everypony
Cupcakes did you say CUPCAKES
bye bye
bye maid_rainbow
bye Maid_RainBow
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X4ZflBPXU
Tiberium126: I did indeed. It sort of progresses as a look into Pinkie's mind from the moment she starts becoming paranoid in Party of One to the point where she completely snaps and starts making "cupcakes"
Midnight_Fyre, Cupcakes
yep
Anyone listen to the Vinyl Scratch Tapes? Here's their panel of Brony Fan Fair :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GweGzevnm4E
Midnight_Fyre: good thing that is never going to be canon :|
whoops, suddenly stream
:O STREAM
Yay back in time for Phase4's wakeup call
08,01oppam Klingon style!
I wish I could remember who the guy was. I just remember that I couldn't stop thinking that he looked like Oancitizen from TGWTG
A PARTYYYYYY :$
Heya Phase4 you shoulg get the helecopter mod/ update for kerbal space program :)
*should
mods are a little anoying to install
Oh fair enough
^^
Life is 20% cooler with ponies

whos streaming
Phase
JRP2234, Phase is, can't you tell by the music? :3
and the volume
Phase4: why you no play "we dont need no education"?
JRP2234, its not as loud
also less clients pls
Dr. Macabre - Poltergeist play that :P
hmm just a sec
but the server i'm about to go on already has music :(
tf2 is taking time to load
Phase4: forgot to quit the other one
hobby
coding bores me
i'm a student currently
Tiberium126, :(
i'm doing electronics and electrical engineering
you dont do that and not do at least a little computer science
Tiberium126: I can't make heads or tales of it, but I'm happy that Phase4 likes it :)
two fields are practically indistinguisable
*tails
though you only see part of one side from the other
08,01need to peeeeeee
Phase4, its a hobby for you, like doing nothing is a hobby for me
/me 08,01runs to the toilet
Suddenly TF2 noises ._.
>.< have to make an Grubbs' test for outliers in Excel :/
08,01sorry, i don't know why i felt the need to share that
it was the 3rd time this week you did that : |
drag and drop
aparently a complex feature
Doesn't sound complex Phase4. :3
http://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/sect-Protocol-Drag-and-Drop.html
AdamTheDuck, theres a lot of text
"Dude, calm down" :D
waiting for wayland to be complete enough to replace x
But drag and drop doesn't sound too menacing :P
i've got an intel gpu now so no nvidia problems holding me back
"Sound"

Phase4, you think coding is complex. try doing nothing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7R0rY_XAxE
Zia: There is a stream, no non-image links please
Zia, no yt links during streams :|
>expecting me to know when the stream is on
also that's a stupid rule in the first place
Zia, lol
Why is it stupid, it is rude for the streamer
not really
they don't have to click
Hmm true
btw, generall querstion, because it confuses me again and again every time, is the rule "No Video Links" (what would mean I can post for example an article about something) or "only image links" wwhat would mean, wqell, exactly that
well*
I thought the rule was no non-image links
Gotta go, Brony Meet-up in NYC today :)
READ THE RULES PEOPLE
Have fun Randomnerd
Bye all, we'll take pictures!
So only image links are allowed, although I assume some text links may be an exception
Thanks, Colt_Brovakiin
Lil_B: you can post articles and stuff... just no videos
Randomnerd be sure to cause a commotion :)
MadSurge good :)
Do not post non-image links during streamsVideo links and links to external sites are not allowed during streams unless you are given permission by a moderator. Do not advertise other sites or channels. If you want to share a link during a stream, PM it to your recipient.
Bye Rand - too late >.<

Just Images are allowed

especially Rainbow Dash
CrimsonPhoenix, ya
i couldnt see it before but now its all i see
Rex_Mundi, Japanese gets it
Is it wrong that I know that doujin actually exist in that picture?
I know some guy in japan is making an MLP JRPG fangame. There are videos of it on niconico.
isn't there already a FF6 MLP Version?
Oh and guys, have some humanized ponies http://fav.me/d4r821l
Lil_B, he meanan actual MLP JRPG from scratch
The thing about furry its a bit sexual.
it's a fetish of course it is
fetish :|
No in my opinion its not
though there are some people that just enjoy furred character because they're cute
i like anything sexy
CrimsonPhoenix, I like it because its ART
That's fine for you
I do enjoy art as well
Tiberium126: CrimsonPhoenix: Furry can be a fetish, but there are a lot of furrys who hate furry porn. There are actually quite a few "asexuals' in the fandom.
Rex_Mundi, and there are alot that lives with it.
sexy art is best art
so if you wish to discuss that with me PM me
Bronysith: TRUE, some of the time
GRAVY
pootis
I have no problem with Sexual art but there is a lot in furry
inb4 Phase4 begins to go "Wtf is happening in chat?" :D
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349008410482.jpg
wtf is happening in chat
AdamTheDuck, now that you mention it
morning y'all
wtf in chat is so common it isnt really wtf anymore
CrimsonPhoenix, why?
You'll see
Tiberium126 yeah, I think a lot of the artist who draw the NSFW Art actually mostly draw it for the heck of it
I found the JRPG video, but its streaming right now...
Lil_B, mhmm
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349004799681.png
OH GOD
Bronysith I love that one XD
Bronysith, I think Mixermike did that
lots of NSFW artists do it for commissions
Yeah I can recognise that style
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/596ce115fd5f5105146b21e02d7cba42.jpg THEY DUN GOOFED NOW :D
I searched for a really realistic MLP Picture i saw month ago, but caN#T FIND IT ANYMORE >:<
oh yea, thanks Lil_B for showing me the HD Mother 3 music
Rex_Mundi: save that and show it to Gold_Demona :D
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348981022551.png oh ho ho i can see where this is going
Lil_B, are you talking about Stalkerloo?
Bronysith, eeyup
anyways, just dropping by, laters
Dken2021 no prop, are you enjoing it?
Bronysith: Big Mac goes NOPE and runs away?
CrimsonPhoenix I forgot the name of the artist

How's it going everyone
Lil_B, like this? http://fav.me/d5br46m

Lil_B: so it's not this either http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d0dd4cb4b3b9ba3a8a18ac58d6844a4c.jpg
MadSurge no, thats real human like, I mean really feral like
Like true ponies :3
This is what I got for realistic MLP http://i.imgur.com/yuLiS.jpg
Lil_B: Unicorns were traditionally supposed to be a mix of creatures, with a horn, a horses body, and goat-like feat.
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348989359539.jpg dafuq
I'm....scared
oh dammit MadSurge

Anypony here collect the toys? My opinion is that the brushables are greatly better than the blind bags.
Bronysith: 4chan leech :(
Pinkie stop munching the 4th wall
Rex_Mundi, finally
might carry on playthrough 2 of borderlands 2
I bought brushables way before

*Denial is magic"
the furry community is a fickle beast
yes, furries. we are as various as can be. it is those that go too far with it that give us a bad rap. we are just people like everyone else, with a common interest.
Hey guys you know what we can do?
Okay im done
something?
MadSurge, love letters updated <3
CrimsonPhoenix, take over the internet? :3
Let's talk about seatbelts!
CrimsonPhoenix, it is safe if you make it.
The furry fandom is much more like a collection of fandoms rather than a single one. no wonder they can never get along. Try putting an FurAffinity users with sofurry forum users.
...is it safe?
DeadpoolDash, to talk about...... yes
...is if safe?
Ok we're still talking about it
Keep it secret, keep it safe.
I LOVE SEATBELTS

Ohai Mega_Milk!
IT WAS A JOKE! dont start discussing Slugbox!

So... anypony ells have any pony toys? My opinion is firmly Brushables are greatly better than blindbags.
You're not alone AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck: me too
I have none
and probably never will
/me patiently awaits for an Octavia toy.
Everypony should get pony toys, the brushable hair is entertaining and they are very cute!

MadSurge I should greet you more often, you never seem to notice me when I'm in the chat XD
Eventually, I'm going to have to completely remodel my room to display all the toys, customs, and playsets
Lil_B: I tend to drift off and do other things :D
/me is watching Adam. like pinkie would watch someone.
Rex_Mundi: I only collect the G4 merch and the customs - figure its far too late to start collecting the original G1 stuff
/me licks Tiberium126 once again ._.
and quite expensive 25+ years later
awww, when I get ion my new Room I want a big all of Planks to Put things on and a big long Table for PC, Homework and Keyboard
/me thinks that was a bit to sexual
Cypresswolf: You must have multyples, right? like more than 1 twilight, right?
/me kidnaps Lil_B
noooo *muffled complaining*
/me kidnaps alexxm as he kidnaps Lil_B
Puts a saddle on AdamTheDuck. And a stirip and muzzle...
._.
/me is watching all the kidnapping
Rex_Mundi: I have a several duplicates - a mane 6 pony for almost every set they appeared in, customwise I have 3 CMC sets, the rest I have only 1 of each background character

Hello cachi01
hi cachi01
Wow Cypresswolf, thats a powerful fine collection!
Phase4: is streaming?
cachi01, eeyup
and that's one fine collection Cypresswolf
yay i knew it!
eyup

And the mcdonald ponies from earlier this year - at least 7 full sets
Cypresswolf: wow O_O i only got applejack but i wasnt a brony so shit happened......
awww, it's October, I may finally get my fully mane 6 set :3 when the deasler gets his new Supplies
I' have no idea how many of each pony I have or how many all together
dealer*
lol dat skin is hilarious
Cypresswolf is it enough to fill a bathtub?
I just stack all the pony merch on a pile in the corner
some can fit on a shelf
Maybe you should trade or sell or give awat your duplicats, so you have more room for non-duplicate ponies, Cypresswolf .
More than enough
inb4 everyone requests a dupe from Cypresswolf XD
;)
/me requests a dupe
:D I have a few dupe individual ponies in the box - snowcatchers, I have at least 3
all I have is a Blindbag with Twilight Sky
I might start buying more than 1 of each individual toy from now on after I see what they go for at conventions :)
All I want is Octavia... Arrrrrgh >.<
all i have is.......uhmmmm....a replica of equestria´s......uhmm...air! yes pure equestrian air.
I'm going to find 5 more Lyra, Trixie & the other 2 if there still at Walmart tonight
probably smekllks like amoniac
smells*
nah smells like pony spirit
Midnight raids seem to be great for the hard to find stuff - if only TRU & Target were open that late

Wrek: I can agree to that.

05and what is expensive with low taxes is cheap with high taxes
Why is Doctor Whoove more popular than Bruce Mane?
idk
probablt because one name sounds less punny than the other

hey Blako
I was in the middle of a hostile enemy lab.
Kinda hard to dagger spam AND talk in IRC. :P
Where the hell is Season 3?
Although, I'm getting good enough that at some point that may be possible >_>
Lonko announcement in 19 days
Lonko you have to wait
Double daggers is so easy to cruise control with. Jump into fray, blast their faces with 6 stacks of bleed, watch them collapse
like the rest of the good little fillies and gentlecolts
Loot bodies.
:D
it will be worth the weight
At least all of the other series are starting again. Treme and Person of Interest. But most of all I want Ponies
You know what IU would like to see, A Season 4 Kickstarter, just to see how high it can get XD

But it really feels like Season 3 is becoming another Half-Life 3
I think he got surgery done in between seasons
Except we are waiting almost 5 years for Hl3
Dollar / Cashier / Money Shot http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319145320/mlp/images/2/26/Dollar.JPG
Besides, Bronysith, when GW2 said "dynamic events can occur anywhere", they meant to say "there is no place on the map where you are safe to idle"
http://youtu.be/H4tyvJJzSDk
05Lonko: stop exagerating :|
Nosrsly. I laugh at the people who idle ingame and end up breaking all their armor because they died so many times.
Wrek: I am not. Half Life 3 is long overdue
Actually I think it really has been 5 years since we're waiting for a sequel to Halflife 2 episode 2
Lonko correction: Half Life 2: Episode 3
Phase4: you still here?
05Lonko: yes you are, you are comparing season 3 with HL2E3
05big exaggeration right there
But it feels like it

Probably helped that I was dropping six packets of bleed on each new group of enemies running in, and then the other four or five people pounded on them. XD
OMG
suddenly best spiderman
I LOVE THE THEME
SpiderMan!!!
i refreshed and it CRASHED
perfect to watch while i wait on laundry
I dunno why people hate the "zerg" nature of combat in GW2, I actually sorta enjoy the chaotic nature of it.

Sumica: yea i see the whole run this program in compatiblility mode but not for XP

00,10should be a dropdown menu for it
Everlasting_Joy to dominate the map by holding buildings that can give you tech and resources to get vehicles and upgrades
i enjoyed bf3, but it was too small
Wrek: Anything's better than BF3
time to install :D
Except CoD
00,10Everlasting_Joy, the final maps will be 200km square
Oh, and the maps are freaking huge
http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0vp1qFtuW1qzvkfwo1_500.png
Too small?
The maps on BF3 are big enough for the number of people involved
CrimsonPhoenix: typos like that make for the best images :D
Sumica: i see it for windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and 2000
056000 people per server is their current goal
00,10odd
yur mah bro, bro
and always ended up just spawn camped
Wrek: "Better then BF3" That's not saying much from my experience, but I might just have to look into PS2 then.
....evil Einstein?
Wrek isn't it 2000 players as of now?
magnet gun?
05DashWithRainbows: 2k as of beta

Good question, Spiderman. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
wat
Dken2021, I want to read Background Pony and I kinda need an ambient song to keep me in the story
Wrek: If it's f2p, I'll sign on.
and I love Mother 3 too much to let it rool in the background
Those teeth.
So appearently webbing is a good replacement for railing
When dry, Spider webs are stronger than Steel
oh, I'll see if there's soemthing else then
Of course, it can't survive much pressure
00,10at this rate wrek you better start working on dropship flying

Ghouls are arabic folklore, they robe graves for bodies, shapshift, and eat children
Bronysith: "Jaws" of course.

sonicandmario85: ah it's "That" FIW sucks period
Everlasting_Joy: makes sense
newt pippington
/me puts Everlasting_Joy in a straight jacket with Sumica
my brain hurts in a special way
Krysztof Penserecki?

FiW is actually funny, surprised me
Bronysith: I'm better with my legs anyway.
*trots around*
I love FiW too
its decent
Mr Sandman~
Its not better than the actual show XD
But i prefer team four star or little kuribohs abridged series better
twinkle twinkle little star.........
but the actual show best
or purpleeyeswtf hilarious code ment
And then Blind gaurdian pop out
PORTAL
DAMNIT GRIVEL
I think Little Kuriboh has been kind of off lately
nothing will ever beat team four star with their abridged DBZ
nah
Bronysith, thats because you like repeated, recycled jokes for 50+ episodes....
Panda: they arent repeated dear newbie
d'aww
spike XD
too cute
"And more fun then college." True.
oh this one
Bronysith little kuribou's stuff is -___-
Oh man, there should be an MLp episode where they go to college!
Panda: you have to know though, without little kuriboh we probably wouldnt even have abridged series to begin with
Stop staring Panda

Rain cloud :(

Everlasting_Joy: thank you
DoctoDoctorWho:friendship is witchcraft

Bronysith, kinda. Making parody series' has been around long before youtube though. so, no, he just got famous for his parody.
Dovah: about 5 seconds ago, why
Lmao :D

DoctoDoctorWho:its an abridged series
F.A.T
DoctoDoctorWho: I like to know things
"How are we going to compete with Noggin'?" It was defunct at the time.

i thought it was princess sparkle
overplanning much?
the train is so long that you could just walk through it to get to your destination
holy fuck xD
omg doom is going to be awesome
but yeah LittleKuriboh is basically the god of the abridged series
~

CrimsonPhoenix: thats an understatemnet
00,10oh we are doing that again?
Its the brother owner!
Also he's a very high tier voice acting
Bronysith, he started calling it "Abridged." He didnt start making fun of series', comedy has been around for much longer than he has been alive. XD
