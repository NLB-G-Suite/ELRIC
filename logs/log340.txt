13better than scavenging at home
/me hands Shizuka a sandwich "see I wub you"
and is anyone in this channel?
1,3^^
1,3always
I find savenging at home fun, but only because I have lots of interesting things in my fridge
i'm very confused by this setup
oh my bad
1,3how do you mean?
is swearing and caps rule breaking?
00,10So did we find out who this is yet/
there's lots of rooms, but only the main channel has people talking, and no one is on the livestream
I've got a lot of junk in my house, and I want to eat healthy, but the junk calls me
1,3swearing a little is ok, as long as it's not derogatory towards anyone else
oh
1,3and allcaps is seen as spamming
and irc doesn't like firefox for some reason
Someone please tell me if this week's lotery is today or tomorrow
that feeling when your looking for something and you forget what it is
most of mine is junk too LadyCanary
ok my bad and ty for telling me
LadyCanary: #first_world_problems
then the better feeling when you suddenly remember like i just did
I do not know, Sumica.
feels good man
1,3the stream should be up, I know it's being streamed to
Lottery is tommorrow
1,3do you have an adblock active?
whats the server details for the irc chat?
oh livestraem works fine when i go to ti
it
try buying your food on a budget. You can't fit much junk food in.
but no one is listed there
not allowed to stream for another 2 hours
sooo wut u doin?
1,3and the main channel has most of the chat during the slower times, the side channels only get active during the events and episodes
1,3reading chat walls and working on a picture :)
you can make a brown-bag lunch sandwich, toss in a banana... solid meal for less than a buck
also: kinda looks like a grown up dash

Nah it must be a male.
unfoundbug: irc.ponychat.net

WHO IS THAT PONY!?
so why try to integrate irc into livestream? livestream has an integrated chat
most of mine is junk too LadyCanary
96 viewers, we have 41 lurkers/bots in here
I swear, this tune is a children's song here in Denmark.

The melody, that is.
impossible... it must be his evil twin!

Dashie: lol
Skrillex isn't actually named Skrillex.
well we have an interesting movie line up tonight. Ill have to stay up.
nearly forgot the whole Lottery entry
dashie, how did you make that link so huge
00,10dat cover song
nevermind..anyone read the hunger games?
Who else is sad about the whole Derpy Fiasko?
I remember one day, over the course of 6 hours, they played "Second Chance" 4 times.
I may have been in such a rush that I just copied the image location straight from google images
1,3ah, nope, I think I missed that one by a few years
Billy Friggin Idol <3 I dont care what people see, he looks FANTASTIC for his age.
and not the website...
^
what's happening with derpy?
oh here

http://www.runescape.com/g=runescape/game.ws?j=1
Anypony gonna see Chronicle
ME!

Hello everypony! How are you all?

fluttershyfan158 http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/small-update-on-derpy-overall.html
hello vteck, I'm good thanks, and you?
I didn't know that and was sad
kirzstryfe sorry about that, I posted before I caught your message.
Pon_Jovi232: it's gonna be a gud movie
make an acc and send me your acc name so i can send it a friend request
Agreed
say wrek, how did you end up on the mouse as a drawing tool anyways?
1,3lol, trust me, I've got too much to do without starting up an mmo now ;)
god damn wrek
your a good artist
I am great. I managed to convert one of my real life frieds into a brony. One more for the herd
i managed to convert my older brother into a brony
vteck9: /)
im gonna cry TT_TT
but this is a sorta chill mmo
hes my only true friend
I don't even know what this Derpy discussion is about, and dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
05Dark_Horst, a very agile wrist
I got two people to become part of the herd, but the third failed
you can easily play on the side and make progress
Dashie not everyone survives the conversion process.
@dashie that poor lost soul
Dashie: I've apparently accidentally converted some Russian guy I know over the Internet.
the herd..sounds like a country band
I was so close though D:
MahBoi /)
kammerjunk: lawl
2 outta 3 aint bad Dashie
^
I'm gonna nap for an hour before work, and charge my tablet... Gotta start on Fallout Equestria and Our First Steps one of these days! :$
1,3hehe, I've tried to do an mmo casual before, doesn't work for me
Well, it's a 66.66, repeating of course, percentage of success.
wrek can u paste some of these songs to the chat so i can get get them
Pon_jovi232: it was more the fact that the third is my bestest friend and I was so close to converting him, all he neded to do was actually watch the episode like he said he would
Kammerjunk: better than nuthin, lol
im one for one , so i guess i have highest rate?
'Course.
1,3just use your instincts on it Morty :p
And I need to DL the ebook version of Dangerous biz... I hear that is mandatory reading.
I have played so many mmo's before they really have got far too samey now
At least you tried
1,3that too
kwak
What software do you use to draw Wrek
uve played runescape?
Most of the people I got to try watching the show are too close-minded. They've already decided that they don't like the show before they try it.
05illustrator Tarku
i dont think u get it
thought by NerdCubed's description of strar trek online you dont need to grind thankfully... but star trek is pretty nerdy
thought so :)
kammerjunk: most people are like that because of 1st gen
Kammerjunk: my friend was the same way, lol
Kammerjunk isn't it sad watching them say "I don't like it!"
this one is really original
Also... Sadness for the :P situation... We wub woo!
and i have played runescape
@kammerjunk everyone who has even mentioned it too me is that way
its been around since 202
2002
Everlasting_Joy: Quite.
Dashie: Yeah, makes sense.
MLP is the only series where first gen is worse than the later gens
i think ive got them, im just trying to be careful not to spam known vernacular like darling, awesome, and sugarcube while not competely ignoring them
kwak
and then the stream started to crash hard
add me and we'll play?
1,3I tried out star trek when it first came out, wasn't impressed with their release product
Dashie you clearly haven't heard of G3.
so relaly
I quite like Tennant more than that 9th Doctor.
i have played rune scape i liked it for a while and then just got bored
we're goin down!
who IS that pony?
kirz
Everlasting: actually no I haven't :)
its star trek
dashie i cryed myself to sleep after watching some earlier episodes
Tennant is the best doctor in my opinion
G3? What's that?
never heard of it.
of course it will prolly be boring
everlasting: would you care to enlighten me
Dashie, look into it. . . with shielded eyes.
Jim: that's an exception
Kammerjunk: generations
hour to movie night =3
Jim: david tennant will always be best
hmm STO is free now so i might give it a try, but study, i must, i wanna get into uni this year
hello?
MahBoi777: Yeah, I know. I just wish I didn't.
Because G3.5 is THAT bad.
huh?
sto
?
That I'd like to EXCLUDE knowledge.
Kammerjunk: oh, okay, lol
play some Nickelback!
star trek online
Dashie, I'll send you this link to this guy's review of all the previous season.
o
kammerjunk terrible, just terrible
G3 might be bad... But DO READ "The Third Generation" It's awesome, and explains G3 with Discord! LOL! :P:D
Jim: but technically he wast 1st gen as they had a 10-15 year gap and it became the first series
1,3the design wasn't bad, but it was extremely repetitive
*sigh* computer games...
*was
yeah, true
everlasting: cheers
OMG
I want to play a game! *updating...*
and i dont know any of my pass words from when i played rune scape before
ohai Jack Black
tenacious D ftw

richfiles: I haven't read it yet, actually.
YAY

I've been meaning to.
the metal will live on
this guy is a great artist
<3 Dat Tenacious D. It is true, you cannot KILL the metal.
Jim: Jack Black? LOL where??
hmm apparently the model designs in STO are too big too

/me cannot hit that high note well in this song >_>
he's singing MahBoi777
revenge of the nerds?
Kammerjunk... Do... It's actually a very interesting read.. If anything, cuse it makes G3 interesting, which probably breaks laws of physics, somewhere in this universe.! LOL :D
Welcome back

EVERYONE, THIS IS MY BROTHER FLUTTERSHY!
pon_jovi232: yes, just yes
hai everypony
You're right Dashie, we should just stick to plushies I guess
Can someone tell me how I do the reply thingy? I'm still new
hey whats up errrveryone
Chocolate: Beg'yr pard'n?
hi
hi
The reply as in (Namehere) Derderpderpderp
the only brony i know
The Earth from here on the Moon
oh haro der
My: I would stick to plushies, if I could find and buy one without my man card being taken away
Dashie: To hay with your man card.
ohai shutterfly
You have PONIES.
@Dashie Is it working? o3o
who d' ya think wrek is drawing?
i changed my steam name to derpy lol
Nope
buy a plushie, say it's for your niece.
???
profit
:D cant wait for the next ep!
Fallout New Vegas download time remaining - 13 hrs 34 minutes ^_^
I also have that problem Dashie :(
How I do that reply thingy D:
What reply thingy?
mega it just needs the other persons name in it
The thing where it displays a sound too
it doesent even matter mega
Oh
Lets see
Mega
My Hai
Nope
:c
where it mega it is in the sentence
You know what, if it's for a Dashie plushie I will risk my man card!
Dismo Hai
Mega: when a name is said, it is automaticly highlighted for them
indeed good sir
THERE :3
Time to splash the cash! >:D
mega mega mega mega
I'm making my popcorn 49 minutes early.
Onts Onts Onts
and a sound is made
wub wub wub
mega
I don't hear any sound
Whelp.
Indeed
if you had a machine that would make any cartoon,videogame, fictional character real..which pony would u make real?
Vinyl Scratch?
You kicked me out :c
Who's that pony?
wait is this dub step
whelp?
No
alexxm the worst thing ever
I have seen every episode so far but have never really been much of the community till now. Is there something like a formal joining ceremony???
Mega, Also. You can start typing someones name and press Tab and it makes it the name most similar to what you have so far.
brb
I would think this is classified as electronic music, not dubstep
fluttershyfan: Rainbow Dash, applejack or fluttershy
no not that i know of
when i flail my head back and forth in the shower and yell, it sounds exactly like dubstep
Dismo: IT WORKS o3o MAGIC!
thats defntly no dubstep
Real dubstep = Coki, Loefah etc. NOT Skrillex
alexxm dubstep is a genre of music focused on the bass perspective and is under much contreversy
ok
okay cool
[SWAG]thehated5689: I'm surprised you don't recognize this word
For example Choc+ Tab would make it automaticly ping Chcolate
Vinyl?
/me dumps Derpysparklz into bucket of his own blood "welcome to the herd"
hurk
if you want to hear REAL dubstep, just go get an MRI
/me glomps Derpysparklz

Thank yew for helping me c:
1,3there, now you're here :)
or a 56k router
WHAT
Vinyl sketch! MFW! ^_^
Why hate Rar? :c
Excision & Downlink is good dubstep
i..hate..rarity
NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HATE RARITY
Wai
its the new "Yo brah. Swaggah!" Speech version of "Well then"
and i'm back with breakfast and my internet is out :(
AGREE

fluttershyfan: I've come to like rarity now, I'm not too keen on twilight or pinkie though
The smileys here are so awesome :D

fluttershyfan158: how dare you!

She lives in the room right next to me.

We barely even talk.
Animation set to music

Dashie_Dashie: um, not sure how to take that?

Same, Chocolate.

"I hate squirells" Why?
I still can't believe dashie is somehow hospitalised though
but im gonna learn in first year of uni as ill be too broke to do anything else
mips doesn't hate me either
I'm quite the Dash fan, so.
There's already a tumblr based on the spoiler clip

how surprising!
If you aren't careful Pinkie Pie will break through all the computer screens
If it's electronic, it can break in several ways.
;)
Cavy: stream is at 10am right?
or are we going for the sentient electronics angle?
hello everypony
IshBestPony: Are you Dracula?
um
8pm which time?
sup folks
/me glomps SuperBrony64|AFK

Yep.
hai :3
Rarity, element of generoisty my flank.

That's also possible, and very terrifying.
Katsumi Evans has a good singing voice
Fear the machine.

Jim IshBestPony is a shapeshifter
07,01your from germany ThunderChaser?
Anypony else notice that Dash sings the Soprano part in Find a Pet?
well that was a fun song
15 minutes until FRIDAY spam
If it's electronic, it can gain sentience and declare war on the human race. It's only a matter of time.
yes ;)
WHOO HOO!
07,018 pm :)
You have no reason to fear a machine

Anyone know why we've suddenly got like 6 new bloods?
I approve this suggestion.

hia EmeraldChocolate
Really?
this video is a repost
15 minutes until what?
o hai emeraldchocolate
does this video follow physics or we cant do this irl
Meanwhile: I'd blame LordCelestia, but I'm scared of him.
Itd be so cool if this was a real machine.
Ah, gotcha. I'm a Tenor 2, Chocolate.
Meanwhile: Someone probably posted a link to channel somewhere
what did I miss?
someone posted the regular channel earlier
YEASH IT LOOPS!!!!1EFCF CXDFGGD JFC
I meant in Bronystate
*shrug*
I'm a baritone

Oh.

Not a darned clue.
I'm not sure what my vocal range is meant to be O_o;
EmeraldChocolate: your name includes my name!
Go punch them in the head
Iggy: not much stream is just getting ready to start
I blame Seth.
I saw this on ponibooru earlier... http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/f0ad1053c21d819a01cfba2fdc8c9b57/124082%20-%20derpy_hooves%20Ferris_Bueller.jpg
new bloods in the main channel? only 6?
Yay. Again. Listen at the end part, and you'll hear Dash sings Soprano...Was quite suprised.
0,5>_>
although last time I checked I could go from bass to tenor
Oh hi, Milord!
Why would I punch them in the head.
when we're posted on EQD like every week?
ScootaChicken: I think your a tenor tbh from hearing yoiu.
Fine evening, isn't it?
I HAVE SO MANY CHOICES!!!!!!
http://www.ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm - Been reading this comic for about 10 years. About retired animal actors & thier misadventures. Today's strip was awesome! ^_^
and now can't help but picture Derpy singing Twist and Shout
Chocolate, shall we be buddies?
but I lost my voice something awful a couple weeks ago
maybe
and its not really come back
cavy: I'll make sure to do that
It's quarter to midnight. I can't tell if it's fine or not.
ohh RubyChoocolate.
otters are awesome though
yes.. i mean maybe.. no? uhmm
NullRadix: Well it is possible to eventually run out of possible new bloods
EmeraldChocolate: for sure
Cypresswolf: HAH!
Meanwhile: Shh, we need to appease the Lord.
woah
It's strange. You'd think Fluttershy would sing Soprano, to be totally honest.
Cypresswolf: that is awesome
Is the stream flashing grey for anyone else?
i heard nyanb
did anyone suddenly hear Nyan?
nyan;
05back with nachos donuts rumncoke
noup
Ictiv: nonsense, we just have to step up assimilation
Fluttershy is a Bass
Who?
id like the cricket :)
So anyway, Pinkie Pies just lining the wall through the hole in YOUR computer screens!

otakon: yup
I heard the first few bar of nyan cat
Meanwhile: HIM. LordCelestia.

That was pretty badass
2001 taught me that's how space worked
if you have iair in your lungs you explode in space
00,10jump to ftl
lol
hullo
Like that would actually work
I like how you can hear sound in space.
How do they work?
Well you can survive for very short periods of time in space without a suit
08,01SaxyPretender: trust me, it works
Space so your lungs don't explode
Lets just pretend that didn't happen, and move on.
r5ytyuiuyiou
...dafuq
A man with a full lung of air can survive 30 seconds in space
Wall-E*
you survive exactly 15 seconds in the vacum of space
Dey gotta exhale cause dat makes da difference in pressue a bit less.
so...many...references
Same, EmeraldChocolate. I wan't Dashie nao.
11,01Pew.
hi
so that's where Wall-E got te idea
go to ludacris speed
man I love the ships in this movie : 3....
0,14ah screw it, it's a movie with aliens
The pain woulda been so bad they.... oh my gosh x.x
That ship reminds me of the Toonami ship
08,01TyeDyeBrony: nope
autposy time
Because or else the gasses in your body would expand and you would swell up to death
space physics....how does it work?
0,14logic means NOTHING
Being in space without a suit is -not- instant death.
ah
want*
lol
00,10ponies are later
That's why he told him to exhale
1,3not very well apparently
0,5======================
then I dunno lol
Just finished my new chapter for my fanfic
Kel can breave in space
actually
So that the air doesnt expand in your lungs and splatter them over the inside of your chest?
it would
Space doesn't work like how you probably think it does.
They've gone to plaid

We know, Sumica. We just want new Ponies =(
not sure what kind of radiation there is in space but you should be able to survive the preasure, or lack of for that matte
I don't think exhaling would've stopped that from happening though.
this is boring

Doctor Who also proves this fact as well
/me wants applejack right nao

05dredge wiped them out
It will allow us to take our place as MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.
It failed at box office very badly that they lost money so is it an a movie
So I'm gonna have to cut off your hand

Suddenly, romance
Instant love
DING!

I think he said he wouldn't
This movie = How Equestria was made
...Nice tatoo there, man
h scene

Aliens love rape apparently.
Why do we vote for Horror movies?
where is me when you need me
kiss*
slap
she's a slut.it's na fact!
Someone should do a pony spinoff of everything.
lol
sudden uninspired romance
why are alien races always so diverse? humans at least have the same amount of eyes
Sexy scene
he's thinking of ponies right now, and she has no idea
I mean if atleast we would vote for Good ones
Behemoth1984
im with meanwhile on that one
DinkyHooves: That is win
equestria is blown up? i think not
coem on, you know you want to watch it
Because horror movies are boss.
lol
Everything should be ponified
Hand abuse
but no one votes for good horror movies
not if trollestia has anything to say about it
*crack* ahhhh my hand!
i texted u
do you remember his reason?
inb4 twilight wins and it gets wmc'd
"Hhmpphmmp"
If Twilight wins I'll kill myself
Or a Western
:[ cock blocker
last good horror movie we saw was House
fuck your romance kale, I'M the shepard here
I think that Canterlot needs to be glassed by the covenat
I think I put Alien down for this week
covenant
Twilight? Who would vote for that?
She has Twilight's hair
This movie's pacing is eerily similar to The Last Airbender movie.
house was horror?
"Thbis is the ICE of TAGReen Hpjhpho"
Also, WHY DO THEY LET HIM KEEP THE RING
or a Buddy Cop film!
The cordata stanata mocada
I know the universe like the palm of my hand
probably because it has a big cult following and he likes it to a degree
you're no good, you're no good, you're no gooood
it looked like a comedy
Middle finger = Distil falagial meridian
His hand is just a tool for their enjoyment.

Agreed Sumica
We had Evil Dead 2 at one point.

No, it's because of his sexual appeal.
sonic rainboom
maybe the blue guys can see the future and know humans will try to blow up the rest of the universe so they are tryinig to stop that from happening
bwoashi

The Titan. and she is beautiful
You know, it actually feels awesome wearing glassess again.
in high school I used to be into anime
So... space
how about ponies?
i think the 3d would have been a lot better (and more timeless) with cel shading or whatever
and the core
I have something to ask about.
"How I met your Space Mother :P "
TheMaster because money
:O
OH GOD NOT NAVI
TheMaster: Because he's evil, duh
Woah...
but not anymore
NO
Like you have no idea.
0,5Oh look

The final frontier
And suddenly Death Star

finally. "I have GOT to get me one of these"

and now you see the size of the titan
11,01They're lost.
TheMaster: He thinks the rase is doomed, so he wants to gain short term goodies, such as money
and TheMaster: he lost hope
Thats some ice cold steel ball
I just said that@!
toon shading
its too big to be a space station
Maybe 20 minutes
but...if he helped the good guys resseruct her. he could make billions building the first bank
plan B
Titan is the Death Star?
...The Titan is...the death star?
I hate contacts
THAT'S NO MOON
There's the new earth!
Because the Titan is. . .
why in god's name would cel shading have been a good idea?

I'd call it the last hope
The Titan is an idea!
There is a girl i like who is really into anime so i kind of feel that i should watch some more.

It began with forging the Rings of Friendship. Three were given to the Unicorns; powerful, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the Earth Ponies, great farmers and workers of the ground. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Pegasi, who above all else desired power.
Are you sure this will work?

If I just use my sonic screwdriver to reverse the polarity of this energy conduit...

Hi Score!
For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern over each race. But they were all of them deceived, for a new ring was made. In the land of Equestria, in the fires of Canterlot Castle, the Dark Queen Celestia forged in secret, a master ring, to control the others.
