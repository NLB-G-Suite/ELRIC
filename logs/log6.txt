Cool.
Hey.
hello
07arf.
as I've talked to a friend of mine - can anyone here explain me why some girls can talk more than half an hour without SAYING ANYTHING at all?
10o-O
07XD
I mean - this particular girl...her communication is around 97% redundant!
10There's words scattered around. Gather them and they form a single sentence!
07then if you lose they're free to get mad at you XD
don't worry - I'm mad at her already
07LOL
and I've just switched my ears to passthrough
07now just nod or say uh-huh every few minutes and you win
07unless they ask you "what did I just say?"
/me flees
07lol
10That's a cheat code.
I just make an adrogynous noise.
07then again that could backfire if they aren't feeling pretty that day XP
that's how you beat the system
10!!
I find it amazing how my sister can phone someone to tell them something, then only end up actually getting to that point 30 minutes into the conversation.
07XD
/me shot
07as far as I know
07maybe.
14owo

4Ok.
I like debates. :P
me 2
4I don't, it makes me stressed and upset.
4I try to avoid them lol.
4It's because people make personal comments during debates and they are not meant to in a fair debate.
4Yet, a lot of people I know do it...
Spiders eat mosquitoes, therefore I like spiders.
4I hate spiders too, I can't catch them with a paper and glass, too terrified, dunno why.
...
ahhh afraid
4And make webs for you to walk in to and scare the living daylights out of people.
12lol
12living daylights
12now about the living nightlights?
4I used to scream at the sight of spiders...now I just go 'URGGHHHH' like a little kid, can't help it.
12i just get scared and kill them
My friend hates spiders.
Which is why I have decided that sooner or later, I need to get a tarantula.
12lol
4I'm terrified of those.
Well, not in a literal sense.
4I didn't mean that either.

lets see the freaking 24 hour races >_>
07because they should NOT all be wiped out!
4Yeah, I mean I don't want them kill people or their livestock but they moved them to Yellowstone and now killed them there.
maybe a ranger should just shoot those people for a change
07Why?
14o.o

03LOL
2:|
03exactly
2Parrallels
03College is annoying, it seems like half the people have MacBooks
03I was thinking more Bootcamp
2:|
http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1934063/ yoshi's cute :3
2Maybe because they like it?
12sounds more like applecamp
2exactly
03nah, because in reality mac usere make up only like 5% of the computing popularion
03*population
2:|
03and actually... you know... boot it
2that's why everything's for PC's, dangit
12only because they are more expensive drf
12only because of that
2>.>
03well not only are they more expensive, they'r enot worth it
03Like, you look at the hardware on a $1500 Macbook
12i think they make awesome systems
03and you can equal or greater it on a $600 normal laptop
12but their OS is all about preference
03who just want to click buttons
03and do all of two features
6MSI?
03MSI is the company, yes
12drf
03what
12apple is great media editing
12:(
03No, though
2:|
12i doubt you're going to agree though
03and garageband, meh, ever heard of Audacity?
12and going to claim that you're the best media editing software alive
03I dunno, I walked into an Apple store th eother day, opened www.anti-apple.com on one Mac, and www.zune.net on another
03The third was broken./
2yes
2XD
6yes
03because they do, I've seen it too many times.
2:|
2nope
12i've seen it once
03They just don't have bluescreens, instead they either don't turn on or freeze
12only once
2'cept when the hard drive disconnected XD
/me brick'd
03I've seen it more than I've seen crashed PCs, here

/me 2kicks drf

03I'm in college
03it doens't work that
03*work that way
2:P
O_o
03Whatever. The thing is... in the real world... typically studios like Pixar and whatever, they don't use ANY real OS... they have their own machines
03Like, have you ever seen the making of for movies?
6I know already that pixar has their own programs

10heh
I really need to replace the smaller harddisk sometime.....
10hm
10it had a tiny HDD even for that time.
the smallest HDD I had once were 540 megs
10heh, beat ours then :P
10was around 1 Gig
...and a computer with a singlespeed cd-drive
with caddy
10LOL
10as in 1x speed!?
150 kb/s
most IR-transfers are faster today :P
hey, that was in 1994!
10Makes sense then :D
10CD's were more HI-FI and such then.
yeah
10LOL
10now you get .... well, a LOT
...and you needed more than one hour to burn one...within a CD burner as large as a VHS recorder.......at a price of around 15,000dollars
1015 000 dollars
10what
10all i can say is "lol, technology"
10and "Thanks for Moores Law"
and - as I said: One CD needed around one hour and fifteen minutes to complete
10but burning takes some time yeah
10but even then, lol
hey, you could have grabbed a gigabyte harddisk then...for two- or three thousand dollars....
the price was around 3 dollars per megabyte
02:O
today....it's six cent - per GIGABYTE!
02LOL
02wow
and people still think SSDs were expensive :P
a 256GB solid-state-disk is around 400 dollars......
02xD
02really?
yeah
02it's 1TB for around $200 here
if you want a fast one
02ah well
02it's still fast
/me shrugs
I'm talking about ssd harddisks
02ah
10heh

02xD
I can grab an ordinary for around 60 euros here - per terabyte :P

4hmm, accidently ate a cold bean then and didn't realise it tasted ok cold
12It's where I met Xai though
12LOL
i was watching some Panorama show about Bristol earlier
4Been to Manchester, it's great, seen pictures of Birmingham and Bristol, it's good, but I suppose photos lie
12Manchester is awful.
4They MAKE them look good to trick you
12Oh and not forgetting KNOTTINGHAM
12Don't EVER go there
12Ever
12Ever
err?
4Why don't you like those cities? Just curious? All UK cities are uglu.
4ugly*
12LOL
4lol it's Nottingham
12RN, Manchester because it's the capital city for gang crime
4So is everywhere else.
12Nottingham because it's the capital city for gun crime
12No
12Manchester has seperate laws because of it's gang crime
4Everywhere has guns, drugs and crime....most cities anyway. But I guess they must have more.
03LOL, detroit FTW?
12Omg if you think Manchester is just the same as any other.. lol
4We get shootings all the time here, it's NORMAL.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
12Yes because people rarely die from stabbings!
hey, I've grown up in a neighbourhood between polands, turks, russians and albans - if one of them can harm me, they really deserve it!
12time to move to an amish city :P
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
4Gangsters are just people too lazy to get jobs at the end of the day.
12amish crime
Gangsters are chavs with guns. XD
like most places :P
12and no RN, not in Manchester
!greet off
12In Manchester, gangsters are 6 year olds without proper parenting.
you should make a LONG bow around Berlin then^^
4Ah, well, it's all down to poverty at the end of the day I guess.
TimeShift
I liked berlin
Hm
12go to chicago -.-
12Yeh and Manchester is a crap hole
you missed the "good" parts Hawkie^^
Hi all
4I like the look of Berlin Zoo.
best city ever is Newcastle-upon-Tyne
LOL TimeShift oh?
12No way, Leeds, then perhaps Newcastle
4Newcastle, I worked there and I liked it.
I bet you've not been to Berlin Kreuzberg or Berlin Neukölln, eh?
12There are good parts of Manchester? LOOOOOL
XD
!greet off

4Well the museums and things they take the schoolkids to.
12Leeds is posh *runs*
!greet on

/me pounces Arti

since they have a uni that's easy to get into there
03there are the funniest cases ever
For those that don't know
12You know it's a well known thing that people of Yorkshire think Leeds is posh lol
12anyway, what's not posh about it?
12It has all the swish :>
What's up with those parts?
The name isn't posh. It doesn't sound posh.
4If posh = very expensive then yeah.
12Otherwise we'd have lived in some place cheaper XD
/me is ignored :P

I've gone through every frame, fixing every last flaw...
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
4oooo
/me falls over
I've got VMWare.
03yeah, it's more this XP machine that's annoying
Me too. I use it on my server.
03Noooooo
03Changing the date didn'tg help
03it's still not letting me on without activating./
2*sigh*
2gtg sister needs the comp >.=.>
4by
2ill be back on......
2laters.
I got it down to 8GB lossless :>
Or 130MB lossy.
03LOL
03Lossless ftw, but that's a lot for you to upload
I use VirtualBox on my server
it has proper USB-host support, it has OpenGL acceleration - and it's also totally free ;)
12bai Sky~
12<late>
03VMWarez is totally free, trial + keygen
XD
VMWare Server is free, legally.
Part of the reason I dropped out of uni.
03Heh, why?
VirtualBox is totally free, as client and without any key :P
03o.o
can you dynamically pass-through USB-hardware to the virtual host with VMware?^^
Timeshift: Yes.
03what do you mean dynamically
/me slaps Vyl
03but if you plug something in with the VM open it conncts to the VM, yes
03LOl serial ports
03hm
I still use serial ports!
03You probably can in VMWare, I have no reason to.
03LOL
03My laptop doesn't even HAVE any
My server runs a console on one.
03anyway, meh at safe mode
03stupid thing won't let me transfer files in any way to the VM
03and I need Genuinize XP.exe for it to work
drf, can't you do it over a network share?
03Not in safe mode.
03Doing "safe mode with networking" insists on me rebooting in non-safe mode for activation.
03it has to be standard offline one
03and I can't drag and drop
03so how am I supposed to give the file to the VM :/
Bye.
03registry keys are just text files, right?
You could.
Why are you in safe mode?
12Night erveryone
nighty Arti
And using that to copy the file over.
Cya.
Sleep well, Arti.
6there we go x-x
2take care Arti

03Oh wow, that's a lot of code.
Lol, mibbit.
03.as I can do that.
/me slaps Mibbit for crappiness
/me burns through it
Oh, lol.
The only other way I see is real oldschool... xmodem.
/me puts in his Ubuntu 9.04 CD
03That
03that should let me use virtual Ethernet
03it's a registry key.
Should have this rip done soon, drf.
03OK
6I'm two away from 1000 pageviews! Ovo

6there's a line between elaborate...and overworked
07http://quanyails.deviantart.com/journal/ <-- Journal.
/me runs
6But the English language is built up of these synonyms. Plus, it benefits me when typing papers and the like.
2Heya guys! ;DD
Hey.
6heck, even in writing stories (although, they can be built upon), write with how you would speak
6But if I did, you'll see that go on and on and on, lots of miscellaneous phrases, and overall rambling. ovo
6My mind can be very active and roundabout.
6GUEST
...Write an essay the way you speak?
Informal essay = fail.
6Nya?
6essays are more...hmm, supposed to be elaborate
Encoding...
/me 6is getting sick off of sharpie fumes
2o.o
6I think of formal formats as essays, and informal as speeches. But even those can vary when it comes to, well, formality.

03we just watched Animal House in here
6my parents (who have been telling me that a mac would be best for me) said that a mac wouldn't be best for me
6and me being me...I had no opinion whatsoever lol
03Of course it wouldn't be :P
lol
6all I knew was my parents were going to buy me a laptop
03Ew netbooks
6and then because that would be too basic, they sugggested an inspirion
03Dell... well meh, after the XPS series they suck
XD
03Fail
03is it any good?
O:
6drf, I like it enough
6tends to be a tad slow, but I think I need to clean it up a bit
03Um
6it's an IBM T-43
03do you know the RAM/cpu?
03That doesn't mean anything to me
03except that it's too old to be Lenovo, LOL
/me has his own laptop
XD
6 1.32 GHz, 1.50 GB RAM
hi
07not for an older laptop
03Hm
03that's pretty slow, though
03Windows XP? Or older, even?
6dunno
6wait
03my desktop is 1GB of RAM, but it has 2GHz CPU
6XP
03Hm.
6I didn't know off the top of my head lol
12somehow i read that as 16GB of RAM
03LOL
03I only have 4
03and no, not the videogame.
6O_O
6LOOOOL
XDDD
03Hm
03rather than 2000.
03as it uses a ton less RAM that way.
03Linux ftw
6classic theme?
03Yes.
6will I still be able to have my choice of wallpaper?
03Yes.
6</stupidquestion>
03I can take screenshots, hold on
03Lemme start up VMWarez
6I know how to do it
6I was just checking
6what I see looks way weird LOL
6so.....gray and blocky
6XD
03yeah
03until XP
2night CR
bye CR
Night~
03Especially with Vista/7... Aero theme uses a TON of RAM
0320%, I mean
03even with 4GB
6geez my grandma's computer has vista and it takes ages to load up
/me spams drf, using up the remaining 80%
03LOL
6LOL
03Aurora, turn off Aero then
/me turns off Aero|Shower
03>_>
/me hides
03well I like it, like I've gotten used to it
03but I have a frickton of RAM too
Turn Aero off? Is that even possible?
/me hides.
03I spent $1700 on this thing
6but then she'll argue that it looks different, and therefore she wont know where everyhting is
03which is why it's beastly
03Haha
6and i'll just have to explain that nothing changed
03you could use Vista Basic
03which is a slightly less cool looking one.
03I hate 7 Basic
03where's that picture
6also
6</freeprogram>
03o.o
03is it legal>?
6yeah
6he has one through his company
03LOL
03oh.
03I was gonna say, it's like $4000
03I just pirated it
03sorta
03The installer is actually on adobe.com
6I think the price went down with CS4 out now
03so I got it legally
6but yeah
03I just use a keygen.
6I'll probably do that
03http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/5684/slidet.png <-- This is my modified Aero theme.
6pft
03just a random picture LOL, of a chemistry presentation we did
6lol
03isn't that an awesome color though?
6yes, very
03Yeah I know, right? I don't mind it eating my RAM because it *can*
03I've got loads of it XD
03Yeah
03I hate Vista
03its themes are ugh
03Windows 7 lets you customize it more :)
6it was cool to look at the first couple times loading
6now it's just a pain
6lool
07arf
03LOL
03but seriously, if you WANTED a good laptop, I could probably find a good one :o
2hikyu
6nah
03and not like my beastly one that's more expensive than the ripoff CrapBooks even
6this thing'll do anyhting
07haiYoshino
6Kyu, I already said I have nothing to post
03I mean, the only reaon I didn't mind spendingh $1700 on a laptop is it wasn't my money
03I had like $2000 total to spend on a computer, from my relatives
6lol
6my parents aren't that cool
03it'll take 20 minutes to load Photoshop
03I don't mean just my parents
03they only gave me $500.
6...
6I had CS3 on this thing
03plus $500 from my grandparents, and then other relatives etc
03o.o
03brb
6it worked wonderfully
6because that's the first page it goes to for me
6Firefox has the "updated topics" page as the first one on the list
6I'm too lazy to think about where to go
07there were 4 posts on the 18th
6which I never caught

10Whoo
10Ok.
gh!greet on
g!greet on
12you got it all wrong
02xD
"Starting dump of physical memory" means it's currently writing the contents of whatever is in memory, to %windir%\memory.dmp
10ok
12exactly
to stop it, just go into control panel -> system -> advanced -> Startup and Recovery settings -> tick "Automatically Restart" and where it says "Write debugging information", change that to "Small memory dump"
10ok
/me gives Xelig00n some Svinekoteletter

10Blue Screen V.2
02Also
02My router is WPA
12Nightshadow i don't see the humor
02can I change it manually to WEP?
02o_O
10hmm, well
10i know why it crashed lol
10i basically became impatient and
02xD
02spammed clicks etc....?
12lol /run bluescreen.exe
10wait
10is that really something?
no
continue on xeli
10i think i overloaded it or something
10and ok wow
"I think I overloaded it or something" does not give anyone a floofy clue why it blue screened ;p
10no, but it's not that important. i know, it's stupid but that's me ._.
the only thing more vauge than that is "I accidently the system... the whole thing"
192*
10LOOOL
but you probably knew that
Pff.
You can't unless you're on my network.
/me 's modem is 10.0.0.1, router is 10.0.0.2, server is 10.0.0.11
Meh, whatever. :P
and you get it there, without him telling you ;p
12but it's not fun when you do that
which made me upgrade my network to WPA ;p
02wat
DS can't use WPA. XD
02yeah I know
02I need it to be WEP
02...X_X
02well Draelen
02am I able to change the settings to WEP?
02o_O
02:O
02GUEST
Open up CMD, type ipconfig /all
10release... renew

Hi
Long time no see, again.
/whois Guest1186927
10ah, hey

Ok. XD
/me glomps back
03:D Hi
02Yes
Yeah.
10Used to, lol
03:D
Although I hid it when I went on holiday, to prevent it from being stolen...And now it's lost.
XD
10You hid it too well ._.
10try less hard next time
Yeah, lol.
02LOL
02Xelig00n
02that was sad
03Lol
02Okay
02prince-dari
Yeah?
02I got the DCHP server thing
02k
Have you set a router password?
02nope
02got in
Ok.
02lol
02type /server hoohrealm.dynalias.com
02xD
02well
02lol
03:D
Mine aew different
02well
02what settings do I have to change?
But if thers is a section called wireless, go on that.
02k
02hurr
02I'm using D-LINK
02well
02after that...?
02Do I have to set my router again?
03o_O
Or possibly security.
02k
No, just have to change a setting.
02k
Whag make isyour ruter?
Ok, I'm on my computer now.
02oh
02hm
02my router is D-LINK dir-300
02wait
02I found it
02so nvm
Ok.
02thanks anyway
02^^
No problem. :)
02^^
02Oh yeah
02As in, my other computers?
02well basically
Changing settings might disconnect the other computers, you just have to type in the WEP key on them and tick auto-connect.
02hurr
02Vista then?
I'm on XP.
02My other computer uses Vista >.>
It's the same sort of thing.
Also, as has been said, WEP keys are really easy to crack.
02ah well
02I know that
02Do you know something that can crack WPA keys?
02I need one
02to crack my school's
I'm not sure, they are much harder.
Ask Draelen. XD
02eh xD
02well
02any programs that can find school proxies?
You mean proxies that aren't blacklisted?
02no
02Like
Yep.
02you can't connect normally
Oh, ours doesn't.
02or it doesn't work
02freaking annoying
We just need the WPA key to connect at our school.
02Oh
02lol
02my school is annoying with passwords
Lol.
02and I really cbb to crack my school's WPA Key
02I tried a couple of times
02ergh no thanks never again
They thought they had CMD blocked at our school. They thought wrong. ;)
03:P
02LOL
02xD
02They block CMD at our school
02but we have access to an "admin" sort of account
Windoes XP flaw.
02lol
Windows*
02xD
03They do at ours as well, but a friend and I worked out how to get to it.
02CMD is dangerous though xD
02If I got onto our school's network administrator's computer
02oh geez
Although copying files isn't.
02lotsa things I'd want to do
02lol
02LOL
02well
02LOLWUT
02xD
02Schools block too many things
02hm
02do you know the ports that aren't blocked at most schools?
80 is the system port.
02lol
02do you have a server?
But you might be able to get out on TCP 53.
02TCP 53?
It's often unblocked. Try it.
02er well Vyl
Oh, I have one set up, yeah.
02Can you explain
02I suck at TCP/UDP info etc.
03Me too
It's the TCP side of DNS.
02oh right
02well
02I'm trying to get into IRC servers

err... oh. XP Do you think that was too harsh? Andyman seriously annoys me to end.
12It's not JUST a dream girl, it's a celebrity on TV that he thinks is "the one"
6FINALLY
6someone told him that
6XD
12No it's not too harsh, he shouldn't have told you to grow up

/me looks at the post done by Kipi
eh...yeah...well...if the girl was pretty enough, I would understand...
maybe
but well
nah
12.. But
/me cowers away from TimeShift
12She's a celebrityu
12-u
/me shrugs
12So how can you justify that EVEN if she's pretty?
12She's a frikkin person on TV
yeah - another disadvantage
...Stupid celebrity obsessors.
did you see pictures of Madonna or Britney Spears without any makeup?
4Yeah I've seen that.
12No but they're ugly enough with make up.
4I don't like how female celebrities encourage anorexia etc.
trust me Arti - ANYONE on TST is WAAAY more beautiful than those "celebrities"
12Nah they don't, some people can't help being famous + slim >(
12I thought she did eat fine ovO
12as far as I knew she's healthy, just weirdly skinny XD
lol
did you hear about this model being fired because she was "too fat"?
12No, but that's horrible
around 1 meter 80 high...
4I don't see why people have to be skinny to be famous to be honest.
...47 kilograms
4I mean where you can see their bones popping out, it looks horrible.
12They don't have to be skinny to be famous, they have to be skinny to be models >v>
12yeh it's disgusting
4Yeah not sure why...
4Gothic models don't have to be skinny :)
now, THAT'S retarded
4But yeah for some reason...popular/trendy type models are skinny and most people are not that skinny.
they are - because the designers want them to look that way
4I wish there were more normal sized models.
that's why I desperately HATE fashion designers
Honestly, I think the whole modeling business is stupid
4size of most people it would be good*
4See you later.
Even then! I just hate the concept of getting rich just because you look attractive and can pose for it.
4I wouldn't like to be famous, I don't like people knowing 100% of my business.
yeah, but honestly: Which normal sized woman wears size 34?
4European size? As that's massive in the UK
european size, yeah
>p I'd rather be rich than famous.
4I meant a size which wouldn't encourage teenagers to stop eating.
12I don't even know the sizes LOL
!help greet
4I'm a size 16 in UK clothing.
well, 34 would be a 12
12Are you sure?
12I'm a size 8..
412 is a normal size for some women here
412*
4damn I meant 12
hrm - wait, I'll go and look it up
4It keeps doing that
12you must have it wrong lol
12LOL 16
1sec
4Erm...I'm healthy
4lol
12Ahh I'm a 36 apparently ..
4I would have to stop eating anything at all to get slimmer
12But only last year I was 34 -_____-
12RN sorry I didnt mean lol at the size, I thought you meant you typoed it
4Weight means nothing, it's personality that counts.
4LOL it's ok! I know I'm chubby...and proud!
12When you said <Rocket_Ninetales> damn I meant 12
4LOLOL it's fine, you don't need to apologise xD
in that case Arti - the model cloth size is usually either XS or XXS
12Oh right
12actually might be XS
12I dunno
4But am glad about it haha
XP I'm only skinny because of a ridiculously high metabolism
4We are working on it....we go for 2 hour walks twice a week
12TimeShift?
4Yeah I used to eat like mad and never put on weight, I am trying to get out of those eating habits now because I no longer have the metabolism
well
S---M---L---XL---XXL
36/38---40/42---44/46---48---50
12lol ok
for the ladies
03o.o
12I used to be XS but I eated even more foods when I moved out of my parents
4I wear some men's t-shirts and coats (because of the style) and they confuse me even more
S---M---L---XL---XXL
44---46/48---50/52---54---56

4I eat meals at the computer.
03eating while watching TV FTW
4And watching TV
03Computer, not if it's MY computer, as that makes the keyboard all greasy XD
Yeah, the distraction stops you from feeling full.
4I meant I can wake up in the early hours and have an empty stomach.
Or if you wake up.
6Hey RDX
7RAWR
O_o
XD
4Everything that tastes nice is bad for you, it's the world's con.
03XD
Nah, fruit.
03Unhealthy food FTW
4I heard ya
4I can't eat sloppy fruit but some is ok.
4I don't like any of those xD
O_O
You don't like them?
They are if not ripe.
4No, I dislike the taste and the sloppyness.
4I don't mind blueberries though.
6lol
Oh, they're good.
You should just eat lots of those as snacks. :P
4I can't, they don't taste nice lol but thanks for the idea.
4I try not to eat anything as a snack if I can help it.
Cocanut.
4I gave in today though, overate majorly, I won't do it again.
They aren't sloppy.
4Can't stand coconut either. Tried it.
...
4I don't mind blueberries like I say as they are little and easy to eat.
4Cool.
D: Forgot to press enter. BRB FOOOOOODS!!!!!
4I thought I'd like coconut.
Meh, I'll eat pretty much anything.
4Arti, do you have a sainsbury's local?
4I'm a really fussy eater as you can tell haha.
4Ok
12Ovo
12That kinda came out of nowhere didn't it LOL
4I've had mine
4I think everyone is making everyone else hungry
My favourite fruit is watermelon.
6o.o
4I like that too, I know it's sloppy but it's kind of an exception with me.
12Mine's grapes, pineapples, blueberries and rasperries
Have you tried...Lichi?
7Fuck it! Ouga ouga!
Mmm, pineapple.
Raspberries, cherries, pineapple, watermelon.
12Yeh

4I like cherries too, they're nice.
4Never heard of it, is it posh nosh? xD
12nope XD
Either spelling is accepted, I think
4Ok.
I hate grapefruit, I just can't stand it.
How anyone can is beyond me.
4I used to put sugar on it
4but that defeats the object
12I dont even put sugar
12Pink grapefruit is nicest
4We also used to dip strawberries in sugar but I stopped when I learnt how bad it was.
12:O XD
4My auntie taught me that one, don't blame me xD
Arti, you may officially laugh at me now
12mmm? Ovo
Pomegranates?
12LOVE THOSE TOO
Yeah, I like them.
4I get a really, really bad chest when I eat those, not sure why. Does it affect asthmatics badly or something?

4Hi Light_Lati
12hai RN~
12But that's getting REALLY technical I think XD
12Yeh, I actually see it that way as well, but prefer to just see it the other way if that makes sense
Yeah.
12J-Man
12No doubt
12>v>
12o.o

Alright
I'm going to nest fairly soon

4I just wait to get back together, and the day comes
07her boyfriend moved away last month
4Ok
07then they just simply ended it lol
TimeShift: A string of arguments happened.
Arrow and i were/are too strongly emotionally connected. And mmm
eww
He's not on there but a lot of our friends are
4It's a personal choice
4I just didn't want my friends, family or workmates to know
4I'm old fashioned and strange though like I say.
4I just follow the examples of my parents I guess.
Mm.
Egh I'm really out of it.
but I'm missing nothing
:P
03LOL
Besides people pester me if I'm not registered!!!
03Facebook stalking FTW
/me runs
12o.o
4TimeShift, you wouldn't like it, I don't think
/me hides

4not that you have to
03or even more than two
03but if only people you knew personally could call you
03then don't put *private* info on there
well, I got my galleries and my webspace for showing my holiday pictures :P
4People can find out where you live from that.
03that's called a phone book.
4I'm ex-directory.
03so it's called intelius
/me runs
03We're unlisted too but if you pay $5 they'll give it out
03Crazy, right?
4TimeShift, that's good but not all of us have time to do that.
hm
03I mean, you can find out someone's name easily
4I didn't say I did
How's it going?
4Here in the UK you can be exempt from records.
03*anyway
03it's like hackers

03That's stupid.

6kyu, I forgot the name for that
12I did yeh
07carbonara
6except sometimes they add egg bits in italy
4lol
haha
6that's all I ate for a week out there because I had a massively sore throat and it was mild enough not to aggrivate it
12They don't even add cream a lot of the time
4But I let it go
12I dunno about quickly..
12Guesties~
6but cream is good :O
07as long as they're not crushed
6worms, the only things that can be in two places at once
6</badjoke>
12LOLZ
My cat used to bring slowworms home lol
12O____o
12Slow worms? For real?
Yep
12There are slow worms in essex? XD
6what's a slow worm?
6!
12Without legs
4he's at it AGAIN how many worms are out there?
12http://www.arkive.org/media/06/062851CB-DB0F-4D65-843C-E7298127D151/Presentation.Large/photo.jpg
4maybe the same one keeps coming back for more
bye everyone
need to go
4See ya
/me huggles alll and poofs
12The easiest way to tell it apart is the head, in snakes, it slims towards the neck
12bai NS~
12But it's just joined solid all the way on a slow worm
And Arti yeah there is a load of slow worms in Essex
4So, me putting the worms back isn't gonna cause them to suffer?
4ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
12I've never seen them
12Nope RN
07they won't
4But I take them off him
4Awww
6O_o
6arti
6that line made me lose my appetite x-x
4I've seen crows treat other birds badly
12Sorry LOL
07XD
12and yes, crows are predators
LOOOOOL
12Few people know that
6lol I do
4Yeah but they also torture their prey, it's bad
12Think of them as little humans
4Little chavs
12Nah they don't, they just eat them alive
4Yeah that
12Saves time and energy
4That's kind of cruel though, even for the animal world
4Then again, Orcas play with their food too
4crows are meant to be intelligent though
6intelligent, yes
12-u
4humans feed them though...
12Orcas don't have to worry because they're at the top of the food chain
4but I guess they don't understand
12Humans do not feed all crows!
Bah
I'm mildly obsessive
12I've never seen country folk take a liking to crows enough to feed them
oops
lol
hiiiiiiiiii
i like crows
12XD
I saw one
6so pretty
12I gotta go D:
6we had a flock of like 100 over my house last week, it was STRANGE
6so many x-x
12brb
4I meant city crows
Ok bai arti
4In the city, people like animals, in the country people hate them, ironic
12Can I be annoying and say POOR LEEENOOOOOOHHHHHHH

4and hi Shara
14X3 thats you.
How old is Hail now? 10? 11?
hi
12omg
12it's El_Sharacabra
Si! :3
12i thought they only show up at nighttime though
Nah
/me hugs anyway
I just go where the goats are.

;~;
Me no gusta linky.
10what
Just say no...Unless they offer you money.
I was there. :P
7Oh yeah.
14Im always in character.
12Xelig00n would enjoy that
10I did. It was fairly silly.
14So its only towards her character, not her owner. >.=.<
10If uso is made usando for "currently happening action" or whatever.
Que o.o;
7Yeah, but I have a feeling Hail is unable to distinguish between reality and her horribly warped mind.
7and I mean odd-shapes warped
7I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be a trapezium.
14ah.
:P
7hello None.
7we were talking about Hail... and buzz-saws.
4your talking bout hail
Than?
Today is a sad day, to be sure.
7true.
I'm too lazy to make graphics that would look good as it would take me aaaaaaages.
Bye bye, Xbox 360. :(
Well, at least for a few weeks.
Then animating them too. O_o
Usando means 'using'
7until Yahoo stops being all emo-fied, you should just use some crappy stickman software.
LOL
Stickmen FTW.
14ah.
10Yeah! I won!
108D
Like 'uso' is the present tense of 'usar', to use
And it's generally caused by overheating, which I am extremely careful about and never caused.
7and I never could get the hang of walking.
10o3o
Basically.
The 'currently' is implied.
It's not said.
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plc2wygwPt4 It's in order of first-last.
Er, usando is 'using', in the sense that it's current and right now
And the 'estoy' part of it is the 'I am'
hi
Or 'yo estoy'
hi :)
7the credits are just crappy move-maker things.
14Teh Cynderz is being quiet.

6except the finger placement is WAY off compared to mine
he needs the conf from this end
the conf's should be Nearly the same
/me 6loves her plastic tenor
6cheaper and yet awesome
Oh well. *prrs in Lati's ear some more*
with *lines, keys, ect, names can be different but nearly everything else has to match up
12Why do they have to be TENOR Ocarinas? Tenors are boys...*hides*
12o.o
6...
6o-o
if it doesn't you get Issues
you know

6ok, taking that zelda one
07buy the feesh tenor
in the oper message console

the server isn't really
hang on
Synced
eck
I lost the logs
using CGI:IRC
12eeeesh...can't anyone appreciate a bad joke? *shot*
well
I got messages saying that modes couldn't be set etc.
and some random other crap I can't remember
that's just caused by the fact the conf isn't setup properly
nothing more
I got about 7 lines or something
afk, TV and maybe drawing
yeah
6dunno...I really like the song that plays during celebi's revival
bbl again

07XD
pfft
4lol this isn't UKfur, Tier.
pr0
2cya Alt and Aero
4We have different dramas than that here...
/me has Tiercel's rifle >:3
Apparently we might be getting an EU president in the next few weeks...And it might be Blair. Stupid EU people.
looking for this?
07baby with a gun!
/me aims at Tiercel
>=D
2Don't think I should here XD
O_o;
4Actually you're right, he is out of touch with how normal people live their lives...
They never gave us a referendum. Meh.
4They never taught us politics in school and I still don't really understand it, but I try to.
O_o
politictc is a waste of time
we need a dictatorship
simple as that
12lol
4lol - baiting doesn't work here.
Democracy fails mainly because they never give us any say in things anyway.
we dont live in a democracy anyway
we live in a republic
lolwut
I live in the UK.
that's it
we vote for a leader to make choices for us
/me shoots tiercel
Lol, it is a democracy.
when was the last time you got to vote on a law or act of parliament?
4They make promises before the election and then forget about those promises when they're in power...
Or, it's supposed to be.
never
therfore its not a democracy
no, it isnt
Brown: We promise a vote on the EU referendum
two years later: Oh wait I changed my mind
-_-
no
4They made Ireland vote again because they said no and they weren't satisfied with their answer.
^
/me facepalms
That was messed up.
why are we talking about this
we do not have a democracy
4We don't need a dictatorship either, that's much worse.
2wb Sky
4wb
Pilands :3
4Erm, I had ancestors die in that, that's not fair to mention it.
you live in Germany, Tiercel?
why do you say that?
wb
4Hitler killed millions of innocent people, that's not admirable.
4-_-
when he was in power, 0% unemployment, a booming economy and he was a fantastic spokeperson
4Tier no one wants this kind of hate talk please.
I mean, he managed to convince and entire nation, that Jews were the source of all evil
and that they were superhumans
its not hate talk
have I condoned anything he did?
Lol, actually, booming economy for a couple years, then all the repercussions of his screw-ups hit the economy.
07no one ever would lol
the fact was, yes he was an evil man, and yes the wart and holocause was an atrocity, but he was a fantastic leader
4You said he was a fantastic leader, he wasn't, he had the blood of millions on his hands.
He was a good speaker.
if he hadnt kicked off WW2, he could have been the greatest leader Germany, if not the world, had ever seen
4He shouldn't be spoken about in a good way though...
But he only managed to convince them of those things because they were exceedingly poor, and starving at the time.
They were looking for an easy way out.
America NUKED JAPAN
And he supposedyly presented one.
supposedly*
4Tier why have you come in just to promote hate? :(
4It's ok though.
leadership skill says NOTHING about motives or beeing a good or bad person...
Tiercel get out of this IRC
2Japan hit Pearl Harbor, America nuked Japan, Nazis from Germany killed millions of Jews
4But you're being hateful?
we dont need to know and this is not a place to discuss this crap
4Fair enough.
12It's just a frikkin discussion
the americans provoked and provoked and provoked japan, until japan snapped
CAN WE PLEASE CHANGE THE TOPIC?!
4Yeah I agree, this is disgusting.
07Napoleon was pretty horrible yet he was a good leader too
12*sigh*
To be honest, you guys are getting worked up over nothing, Tiercel isn't saying that Hilter did good things, just that he was a good leader.
at least someone is getting the point, thank you dari
2I didn't disagree
Something like that.
For I intend to write it
I think it was him, anyway.
12Tier, they think you mean that he was a good leader for everything he did -v-
Yes, he was good, but you have to take into consideration that the people were desperate at the time.
/me sighs
And were starving, and poor.
this is getting way to far now
12Wtf, can you PLEASE tell me what's getting too far?
about the victors writing history, the French were said to have taken plaques off the Berlin victory monument that leads down the road from the brandenburg gate during the occupation by the war victors
12Are we not allowed to talk about history?
because it featured a war in which Germany beat the french apparantley
sorry, arti.
Tiercel: I agree that he was a speaker, but I don't think he was that good a leader.
12It was his personality
ok
sorry for complaining
12o.o
turns out it belonged to a 30ish yr old woman
LOL
07lol
2I'll never let go!
12Unless it breaches the rules
/me is shot
12lol wow...
12O___o
2Oh, I was never taught that XD
I like that quote.
all the soviets found were two fragmented skeletons, which have always been believed to been hitlers and eva braun's
12Wow!
he might even be still alive
12LOOOOL
Doubt the still alive; he'd be over 100, I believe
2Almost
12He probably changed his identity
shaved his mustache
12it's nitler :D
2XD
12LOL
it's ok. arti. and I understand.
12Who knows
Even without the famous mousache, he is recogniseable.
2It wasn't me!
o__O
Shave his head.
Some convo
Wear a cloak.
Werner Von Braun and the sort
lol Nick
Vun Braun...
"What did you do?"
"I made the superweapons that terrorised london!"
"War criminal!"
"I'll help you beat the soviets."
lol
12hehehehh
My favourite Bush quote "One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror".
epiclol
12.........
12Hahahaha
or "I think war is a dangerous place"
LOL
12Oy..
07"Oh, no, we're not going to have any casualties."

but phpmyadmin says they are still there

12Did they even call you or did they just send a crappy email?
ok
Hm
got a nice handwritten letter :3
Idk if the services are to blame
12Lucky for some :> but then, there were 169 applicants when I applied O___o
I think it has more to do with the hash
k
12back~
10>_<
12Er.. sorry
12Speaking of that though
12The lisense "X41 FOX" is up for auction and we're bidding like over a grand on it

12So we don't know if that's too high or too low, we're just trying to getit XD
Yes
07what is it about?
07O.o
...
money > sense
o_O?
or would that be money < sense
Hm
I fail at maths
07Articuno
12It's an investment, but we'd probably not sell it
/link
/connect
its not an investment Dx
12Obviously not then :>
When did you load it up?
/me runs
12My parents one is worth LOADS because it says the word "tap"
how many other Xai foxes are there!
xD
12It's not the X41, it's the fox
12Fox is a last name
12We probably wont even win it at that price!
Try restarting-ok :P
/restart

12But it's the most we can afford right now LOL
07Meeps

guh
07http://notalwaysright.com/factual-innuendos/2558
just go to the DVLA and BUY a custom liscence plate XD
only costs £230
12Thats not an investment, and you can only have certain numbers/letters ofcourse
and seeing as youre bidding a grand on this one, you could buy 4 custom plates!
Win
12We cannot ever have XAI FOX
12Or XA1 FOX
Yep
12Anyway we've already bid :3
12Dunno when it ends but I hope we get it LOL
for the services
12Someone's probably bid way more though :(

Well, kinda
/me tries to figure out how to colour sand
It's like any other link, except you just use 127.0.0.1
For setting up the services
07food coloring and a jar?
I'd copy the link for the main server, changing the port to 7070
Er, uh
sharpies
07lol
color each grain one by one with a sharpie
12DIGITAL!
12>v>
07XD
not 7070, how about 1025
And for password, use
2jz6jxbj
one character changed :D
/me is shot
12Tier if you thought a grand was bad.. we spend ten grand on company shares at the start of this year
12lol
:D
12<lste>
12Yeh, and one grand is WAY less than that lol
12*late v-v
12plates normally go for 2-3000
12When they have certain things on them anyway
Yeah, set up listen as well
I'm using global
It may work but idk
/restart

With that, you can delete every other alias in unrealircd.conf
for services
Then rehash and it'll work.
ok
/cs lol
brace for epic fail
:D
Lol.
You can also remove the link block for the services :P
That wasn't it
10eh?

The server computer is screwed up
?
prince-dari's?
hfvgoighraeoighiosdfg
I scrapped up enough parts at school and outfitted an old one
I got my server computer from a friend :D
No more wi-fi server :D
Heh, I thought I was gonna get a computer from the school
Mine's on wi-fi, but I need it to be that way
wtf @ Tier's IP?
Well, the wifi was only part of the problem
IfILikeYou@82-33-2-121(etc..)
The other one had viruses I thin
and my parents used it and they would turn it off at times
07that's not the isp lol
My school has a drawing for super-old computers
And my middle school's tech teacher gave me a computer the last day of school.
It was horribly old and I ended up giving it to a friend of mine (not the same one that I recieved my server from)
I think
:P
But yeah.
I could have picked up an IBM from 1994.
Old as in Win98 (and possibly 95)
07anyways
12newt.blueyonder.co.uk is his ISP
I think it was a 333 Celeron
I don't remember, though.
12BlueYonder being Telewest aka Virgin now
/me bunnehbunnehbunnehbunnehbunneh
o.o
This one was a pentium 2
i think
I got some RAM as well, but it didn't fit
12http://articuno.deviantart.com/art/TimeShift-and-Luane-141336369
I know I had a 2 sister laptops that were 333 Celeron and 300 P2
Check before you try
Probably took SDRAM?
I took DDR
Like my server computer and my parents' computer.
I took it outside and blew it out with a leafblower.
It looked like it had snowed
Mine's an '04 (or so) Gateway
lol.
But I sold that to the friend that I gave the old compy to/
This one was one of the first XP PCs
I'm running Server 2003 on it now
looks really amazing :)
12AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm just running XP Pro on mine
Too lazy to care about server.
/me uses XP on EVERYTHING.
I should try intalling it on one of my cats...
Which is?
Also, server port?
a watermark in it?
Uh
Link, as in.
Yeah
for linking
Use 5000, if that's Ok
I'm assuming you have an allow block
Ok
I'm ok with exchanging the oper blocks
</lol>
It's working fine with prince-dari's server without using allow
If that's OK with you, of course XD
o__O
12No not that
12I've put the watermark on but it's VERY subtle
12^^
07Yay
07arharha

07Oh yeah

I still need to do a couple things.
02lol
02k
Port 6667?
no
7777
02:O
O_o
02why 7777?
6667 would really screw things up
02how?
02:/
wat
02yeah
02Altair's server is on 6667
Maybe that's what's cauing the problems
/me lies down
02I could try link Altair's server with yours
02but yeah
02what problems?
I thought there were problems.
02eh
02those were fixed
Of course the client port is 6667
/me sits
02but for some reason
02I still can't see the server notices on prince-dari's server from Altair's
... because they're local to prince-dari's server.
02oh dear
02TST is STILL down
02okay
02this sort of thing
2yeah...

As far as I can remember.
02yeah

02reminds me
Well they don't on any other networks I've been on.

/me tries to take it off
You are the 590,905,457,1.5 richest person in the world! <-- ololol
is that yours?
Note the decimal point
No.
Well, technically maybe yes
/me isn't working
You're in the TOP 0.69% richest people in the world!
You're in the TOP 98.48%
richest people in the world!
:O
lol.
that's my parents mind you :o
You are the 5,742,857,143 richest person in the world!
You're in the TOP 95.71%
richest people in the world!
YES.
If you put in something less than 100, you get higher than if you put in 101 or something
I put in 200
Putting in 1 = 5,780,722,892
Putting in 115 = 590,905,457,1.5
Also note decimal point
In the second one
wait
That's digit grouped wrong
horribly wrong

/me sneezes on the bunnehing KyuBunneh
/me makes an EMP somehow, but doesn't use it.

XD
07because it isn't spam
Repeating the same word continuously is one form of spam.
exactly
07besides, mods are partially exempt from that rule
07considering I can actually spam and not get kicked for it
Saying "Bunneh Bunneh Bunneh" isn't bad at all
07one line every few minutes isn't overdoing it by my standards
07if it were more often, then yes
Or are mods exempt from that rule, too?
07that applies to being harassed
that also applies to being annoyed
XD ya
03That's precisely why #PM akicked me
why hello there drf
>_>
hello
03LOL
lol
how does that promote godmodding? o_O
03because
03You can't define "annoying"
03therefore it's
06thus, "not annoying" rules = waste of time
03which is why I'm in total disfavor of any such rules.
07lol
03because I'm usually considered annoying
lol really
drf, checked out the file yet?
07which is exactly why there's nothing wrong with me doing it
03what's annoying to one person isn't annoying to someone else
DRF, we were asking him to stop. He's the mod here.
Who's "we"? Isn't it just you? O_o;
Me and 365
06see, vocal minority

But I'm also in York Region...
GAH
80 must be locked.
You're confusing me.
Silly californian.
D=

:(
Well the one on 8080 I just set up works immediately.
You're job is to mod, not annoy.
07or at least it would be if I was paid D=
:o
Where as the port 80 still doesn't work.
well unfortunately I can't connect on either of those ports then
I would pay you 5 cents a day
Because all ports are blocked at school
07but...
07I dun live in china
07o3o
They can't be. :P
They are
You're asian, good nuff.
except for port 80
WAIT!
I can use a program to find out which ports are open.
try 402!
I haz some dodgy programs.
yeah do that please xD
lol
try 402 first
Oh well.
Yeah, it needs to restart
/restart
k
I'll try now?

03church dances... did they play a bunch of fundie music or something
03?
6I wish our channels did it
6fundie
6?
6wtf is that?
And everytime you tune to a different channel, within 10 minutes you'll hear it.
03Jehova's Witnesses are the best example
6the songs that play are usually top songs in the country
03-S
DU-NUH, NUH-NUH
03well it's just weird for a church to be playing real music XD
6we had two of iTunes top songs in the lineup this time
6I guess it is wierd to some people, but it's always like that
6"Everytime We Touch", "No Air", "We Like to Party", "Just Dance", "Disturbia", etc
6those kinds of songs
6we even had "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feelin" last night

Hmm.
Logging packets sent.

02also
02what program did you use?
It doesn't have a name, it's just some program in something call net tools 4.
Also 74.242.238.162 comes up.
02o-O
02[17:06:33] <@prince-dari> Also 74.242.238.162 comes up.
02that's Altair's IP

06when I join
06mIRC
dah, I just wanted to ask cuno something
06lol
You could go to the settings, then click the options tab.
Click perform.
Click add, then scroll through the list, and add this network.
I just have that set up for all Networks.
on *:CONNECT:{ if (%network == TheSkyTemple) { msg nickserv ID password } }
much more reliable
It does the same thing, just only for this network.
You can set it up to do it only for this network anyway, lol.
06awesome, that worked
if all mIRC setting return to default for whatever reason there you've just got to reload the script
perform is easier imo
12imo?
No, because that would be too complicated
I'm sure I could though
Maybe I could try that ...
hi
Hullo
:P
12lol
the IRC protocol is simple but it won't be possible in 20 lines
It is really that simple, lol.
/me runs
Hmm, closing it disconnects you, but yeah, setting up connect you'd have to change it manually if you wanted to connect to a different server.
Quincunx?
No, I mean, getting the system to actually handle the talking to the server about ACTUALLY CONNECTING, would be difficult in that few lines
using protocol already made for you
Let me find it, I'm pretty sure it's just one line, although setting up information beforehand doesn't count.
It's just the line to connect I'm talking about.
Vyl, I believe he's saying PHP has a built-in function to do all that for you
No, the socket function.
which is the same thing ...
Sockets are built into pretty much all languages.
Not all, and unless you're using one which knows IRC-specific protocol already you'll have to set that up
06._.
...I said pretty much.
They are not IRC specific.
and yes, I know sockets are not IRC-specific. THat does not mean that IRC uses them the exact same way as everything else.
O.O!!!
Well, PHP isn't made to support IRC, and yet you can connect to a server with it very easilly.

7If you get it, FOCUS ON THE PLOT.
?
o.O ok
oh
that sucks :(
No
Thats doubtful ns
and then be tricked into seeing it the same way as local connecting to other DSes
Yeah, I think it IS possible
but it'll take a freaking LOOOOOOOONG time
with a lot of glitches and errors
and I haven't played one for... 6 years XD
LOL
xD
and it was fun tbh
/me gives Nightshadow a hug
7Well, it was a bit boring at some parts, NS.
7Oh, and oddly enough...
7There's this person on TV tropes that describes Demyx as extremely apathetic. o_o
12lol
lol Quan
that's epic fail
7Really?
eh
not really
7Do you see him being concerned about anything?
perhaps a little
7Well, other than his sitar?
that's still not very apathetic though
LOL
KH2 is win
lol
/me prefers KH1 to KH2...
/me 7actually has that date and information memorized. O_o
12even tho Axel is in #2!
/me hides
wait
i had KH2 o____O
for the gba, right?

7No.
12no
7That's CoM.
12thats Chain of Memories
ok
12<late> x-x
yeah, had
i traded it in i think
or traded it with someone
idk XD
12well, CoM is the worst in the series :/
Lol gba games are fun
Yeah
7I actually agree with that.
i played it and i was like...
"I am disappoint"
7Though Re:CoM's not half bad.
lol
i guess i'll try 358
7Did you follow the plot, Alt?
I completely breezed through KH CoM
12but I say KH 358Days/2 was everything Com wasn't
Quan, yes
and another thing why I found it fun was because I was able to battle with my friend
7Oh, and GBA PS cutscenes. O.o
I mean, I know some of it
lol
Like, the basics
from playing 1 some
12lolyes
12NS?
12trying? o.o
I'm trying to set a wi-fi option up
by hacking the ROM
7Then how're you gonna distribute that?
DOWNLOAD
8D
12lol
I'm actually playing TWEWY
you'll need an R4 or similar though
acekard 8D
12?
TWEWY is okay
7NS, I have it on a DS.
the world ends with you
yeah it's pretty good
12oh
7How'dya expect you get that to work?
yes
12ok
7I met a bunch of TWEWY fans at a dAmeet.
or you can set it on the computer
I think No$GBA has a wi-fi option
but I'm not sure
wel
or I forgot which emulator has wi-fi
8D
hm, I like using Xemnas still
Except I find him a little slow
7Wait, that reminds me:

06hmm
06looks like I'm about done
12awwww :(

06..
06why aww?
06my picture
06loooool
2XD
03<Glacymr> http://notalwaysright.com/common-sense-is-not-that-high-reaching/1872 <-- LOL
03The thing about that
03what if you're handicapped?
/me runs
12they roll down the stairs
03LOL, sure\
2http://notalwaysright.com/when-you-know-you-need-better-glasses-or-better-handwriting/2283
12they might have an unpleasant landing
12but at least they got down :D
03XD
03:O I left my laundry in a drier for about 3 hours. brb
06loool
2o-o
2XD

12http://notalwaysright.com/give-me-good-ol-inefficiency-any-day/1811
03back
12wb
03LOL
03basically, here's the idea
2o-o
03if you're using cash, then you'd still'need to do it the normal way
06drf....self-service registers
06safeways' got em
03Lazier than that anyway
03all of them would have unique barcodes that can be detected by the metal detectors, right
03make sense?
06yeah
06that's alot fo barcodes though
03Like I said, for cash you'd still have to do it by hand or whatever
03not *barcodes*
03barcodes need to be scanned
03I mean, some sort of magnetic sensor
06ah
03I don't know for sure yet, LOL
06but same thing
03But I think it definitely could work
06each would have to be unique
03per product
03not per item
03they already do it with barcodes...
06hmm
06true
03I'm sure it's still a few years off, I'm just thinking concepts
2o-o
12http://notalwaysright.com/shoplift-and-drag-and-haul-away/1214
03but it's definitely not impossible, and would be awesome
06indeed
06also
/me finished her picture

12lol
12k
07LMAO @ Horo! That would be too mean!
12probably work though
if it was a cage made of cardboard or chocolate, they could probably peck through it yes
12i don't think it's possible to be that desperate
Lol
though, is it actually possible to get non-wire cages for birds?
I'd've thought that anything else and they'd either suffocate or be able to get out
07I suppose you could build one from ventilated plexiglass, but I wouldnt

07 ):
07Hi all
07Horo, yes, many colleges are offering that deal
eh well, I still got it cheaper that retail price
07Well, honestly I dont know how many, but some do
07Oh, thats good
I went for the middle one
07I wont be able to get 7 on this computer. Its XP. They said I'd have to remove all of the apps, install 7, then reload the apps. I dont know how, and cant pay anyone to do it.
On a similar note of strange prices my CPU (which included CPU cooler etc.) was Â£40 cheaper than the OEM version (which doesn't include those things)
07Plus I have no idea where most of the disks are to be able to re-install
07Huh, thats weird Horo
07Wow, my stomach is making noises. Who's making me something to eat?!

Tbh
No offence
Fro is a retard for reporting that as flaming
12XvX

I only posted a meme
Hang on

Survival Guide of the Lions. Lions.

12the planets formed after the supernova

12I get it
'-'
12anyway...
/me tickles Lugia365
07wb
wb
and PS
I don't think thats humor, NS
That is humour
And I intended it as humour
12it's from Jupiter...
7its called interference
12it is a rare thing to listen for
it's a reference to that
7o.o
12and...
I think the first few rules and rule 34 are the most well known.
Who/what is Eric?
12Has anyone heard of the Multiverse theory?
lol
12idk
I know the rule up to 47 or something
O.o
PS
They're not actual rules
And my post was a joke, you know.
and hi LLOTS
7uh...
Hi :>
lol
07blow up something
Why are you being argumentative?
7okay
7so, you take a bottle of odwalla
7drink it up, then half-stuff it with bits of fruit.
lol Ragnarok
02Because these 'rules' hurt one of my friends, and they were banned because of it.
7it meaning the empty bottle
07and blow it up
uh
...meaning?
12there could be another earth out there about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 light years away
7close it, and stick it in a locker, or some other random place that won't prevent it from fermenting
/me sighs
You mean Fro?
7*done
02Who else do you think? How would you feel if someone just insulted something you did?
hurr
where did she get banned, again?
7he's right
If you're talking about the HoR shoutbox, it had nothing to do with that
lol
12look it up
7._.
07oh, you mean the WRONG Theory

And PS, try not to get all dramatic over this, k?
02I RLY DUN CARE
It's over
Pokemonstar: I think you're taking this a bit too hard
Yeah you are
Perhaps you want to defend Fro, but this is really unnecessary
If you really want to be satisfied
O_o;;
02Fro has been my friend longer than you have. I only want to do whats right.
Reborn! *shot*
But
If you want to do what's right, you need to understand what's right first
You're taking this over the top
02And if you think I'm taking this towards Drama, I'll leave, I have to go anyway
12stop please
It's over, okay?
okay
bye
7:\ I doubt it, honestly
wow
massive...crap
Yeah I agree
7wait... stop stating out opinions?

06but lol
12roara all i have to say is that if this is swine flu it's not that bad :P
06points for actually doing it
06bree, it's not
03XD
03but seriously
06even the mild case my friend had was like the flu itself
03I was like "Macs are for people with more money than brains"
03and she was like "Look at how pretty this looks!"
07loooooool
12i heard it's even worse than the swine flu lol
12so of course everyone worries about the swine flu
06exactly
06a family friend had Flu A just a week ago
06on the phone with him, he literally wished he could die
06yeah
12i guess if you're working
06and apparently it'll get you a spot on the media
/me runs
12then yeah i'd worry about that
06hmm
06this is nice
06it's seriously lagging
03it works fine on normal ones
06I know x-x
/me RUNS
03that's how bloated it is
06lol
2o-o
2brb
06ok
06one thing I did like about WMM was that it automatically made smaller clips from the movie
07lol
2XD
06like 30 seconds each
06I cna't figure out how to do that on here
2o3o
07I can't even get it open for 10 seconds before it crashes
03So do I
03but I don't use it
03yeah
03Adobe sucks
03Um
03Roara|GIMP, 1. Why would you want to do that?
032. you can do it manually, dunno about *every 30 seconds*...
03F3 and F4, select start/finish, then there should be a "Trim video" option
03LOL n00b
/me runs
03That's the only way I ever do
06n00b?
03it actually makes it a LOT easier, IMO
06x-x
06?
03because there's not 900000 clips
03just one.
03what you do is
03and seriously, try it.
06yeah but like I said
03Watch the movie through at normal speed, no interruptions
06WMM made 30 second clips
03have paper in front of you
06well
03then go edit it, you have time codes, problem sovled
06hmm
/me hides
03but seriously, it works
06hmm
06well I guess I'll just have to get used to paper then lol
06yeah, that's my hobby
06and now that I actually have HQ videos
/me runs
06lol
06yeah
03well, the thing is
03splitting it into 30 second clips is counter productive
06not how I did it
03because then EVERY TIME you want to use one yo uhave to be like "OK, clip 1... clip 2... which fricking clip is it in?"
06but I'll adapt
06nh
06nah
06I memorized the videpo
03at which point, no point splitting it up.
06video
03So why split it up?
06of course
03...
03F3 and F4
06now it's easier to trim I guess
06so lol
03F3 = selection start
03F4 = selection end
03forget dragging, LOL
06plus it just looked nicer with shoter clips
03Get one part of the movie, put it in the timeline
03then select another part, do the same
06it looks nicer 8D
/me runs
03oh.
06dunno, put em together
03XD
03it's kinda different than you're used to but it's not too hard to figure out
03speeding up/slowing down...
06lol
/me wonders if anyone's heard this song
06OMG GET THAT OFF
06THAT SONG
06IT BURNS
06I hate that song
03LOL
03really?
06yes
03where are you downloading them from?
/me rus
06jkfdhfd
03which one?
06not a reliable one, I have to stop after 4ever because some of them look bad
03LOL
03let me guess, SkyFire47's rips?
06http://pokemonanimeworld.webs.com/
06duno
06possibly
06pokemon 2,3, and 4 look fine
06I guess
03ew signing in
03does it have a watermark from an encoder?
06no
03LOL
06but after 4 they do
03We have the English and Japanese ones
03English dubs FTW though
06drf, I never got around to getting to that one
06where again?
03o.o, whose watermarks? SkyFire47/JDS/who?
03Pokémon-Originals. But you'd have to download them using XDCC
03EW JDS
06xdcc? I'm afraid to ask
03File servers.
03there's a very specific way to do it
06ah
03but our rips are *good*, LOL
03did you want English or Japanese?
06japanese
06english audio
2o3o
03I don't know if we have dual audio o rnot
06not dual
03*raw
06yeah
03why?
03the raws suck, LOL
03No, seriously
034KIDS did some color correction
2o3o
2nah
06too blue
2 4Kids made color "correction"
2exactly
2they placed a blue tint over most of it
2XD
2drf
03that was only in Heroes.
06I think 5 is the one I'd need in japanese
03the rest of them are awesome
03Like, seriously
03look at the second one
03like, really really flat.
2:{
2*:P
03Well we're actually working on a DoR of 5, but it's not done.
03either way, we have both of both.
/me 2disagrees heartily
2XD
06I loved the color correction in 2000
06haven't seen many of the other raws though
2XD
03and heck
03there's supposedly proof that the raw of 7 was *worse*
/me 2doesn't
2XD
03from the theaters
03Apparently in theaters there were some typos and such, and for the Japanese DVD they "fixed" them
2o3o I highlydoubt that
03but it's not OTV, therefore it sucks
03you want pictures?
/me runs
2I've seen it in theaters and on dvd
2o3o
06sure?
03In *Japanese* theaters?
06and for crying out lous
03I'd have to look back in my log... but eh
06I wanna kill my laptops lagging
03LOL
2XD yes
07lol since when was 7 in english theaters
03o.o
06it is literally at 100% right now
2In Japanese theaters
07o3o
2no
06and hasn't gone down once
2XD
2duh
03where do yo ulive?
06CPU
06mIRC and Corel
2I'm assuming we live in the same time zone
03LOL
03so you went to Japan?
2drf: the difference is that I go to Japan every year XD
2Visiting my grandparents
If it's 6:04 am where you live, then you're in my time zon.
zone*
06nope
06it's 11:05 pm here
2XD
03Oh
03get me some Japanese promos?
/me runs
2XDDD
03but seriously, there are *tons* of rental-shop Pokémon that hasn't been ripped
03x.x stupid lazy japanese rippers
2lol
2o3o
03someone found it on Yahoo Auctions Japan for like $3000
03but that's rediculous
2o-o
07lol
2uh...
2Â¥3000?
2that's less than 30 bucks
03No.
06at this point, I say screw this
03actually $3000.
2XD
/me closes corel
2wow
03http://usotsuki.info/deoxys_compar.jpg <-- This.
06100% CPU for 10 minutes straight
2o-o
2that's crazy
03see how they changed the font?
2CPU overload, gotta wait a bit
06yeah
2o3o
07lol
/me is listening to 3»»2 Ke$ha - TiK ToK 3«»2 00:44/03:19 3«»2 256 kbps m4a (iTunes) 3««
03but it's such a chick song
2and you believed him straight off the bat?
03I'm ashamed >_>
07XD
2XD
03Sparky, he knows a ton about this stiuff
03*stu\ff
03*STUFF
2really
03He's trying to sub, like, all the episodes
03Yes.
2XD
03I'm seriou1s
03*serious
03-x
2that doesn't make him top-know it all, you know
2aaaaaand its still loading
03LOL.
03I didn't say he was, but he heard this from a reputable source.
03... it's not mine.
2o3o
2reputable?
2Yeah, I know its not yours
2I mean, what's the source for the image?
03http://drfsupercenter.info/Programs/ULead%20Video%20Studio%209%20Free%20Trial.exe <-- Roara|GIMP, you could try this.
03DVD.
2FINALLY ITS LOADED
03Dutch because it's widescreen
06eh
06lol
03but it's older, and I *think* less CPU intensive
2The Japanese one is clearer-colored, has better-integrated lettering, and overall looks nicer to me
06crud
2o-o
06ew
06>_<
2The Dutch one looks flat
Why not just get PS CS4? O_o
2like you said that Japanese looks
06...?
03Sparky, apparently the font on Dutch is the one used in theaters though...
I dunno, I don't like GIMP...It's slow loading. Especially with its fonts.
03well
03GIMP is lighter overall
2o3o
06I'm getting CS3 soon
06for free
03it takes longer to load, but once it's loaded it's fine.
06GIMP is fine, my only issue is layer control (like resizing, moving, etc)
06but that's not bad
2Mmmmm
06lol
06everyone likes that I think
2although its quite possible
06wait
03For the earlier movies, at least, not sure about 7.
2drf
06drf, in that pic, isn't the american text the same as the japaenese one?
2the sizing difference makes it harder to compare, honestly
06I havent seen the 7th in ages
2o3o
03They didn't paint anything over, I don't think
03but the Japanese one changed it further
03but listen
06ah
03it showed in Japanese theaters
03they then dubbed it and shoved it on DVD
2XD
03well
03the Japanese DVD came out first
It's just awesome how easy they make it.
03BUT
2LOL
06lol
2fail
03They messed with it, brightening the colors and such
03changing fonts, etc.
2XD
034KIDS, on the other hand, just left it alone
06in that piture comparison, while the font of the dutch one looks like it fits the "pokemon style" more, it doesn't fit with the fact that it's a building
2brightening?
06sparky, yeah
2Haruka's bandana is darker in the Dutch :P
06dutch =/= american
2*Japanese
06...
03LOL
Good night
03You guys over analyze everything
03Roara|GIMP, actually, yes.
2XD Its not brightening, they darkened it
06lol
03Dutch meaning the DVD came out in The Netherlands.
03But it's the English dub.\
you know. I never use myspace.
03well the DVD was dual audio
Bye, all
06xD
2I prefer to rather think of it as paying attention to detail :3
03but... you know how the American DVD was 4:3 (fullscreen)?
I think it stinks
03They cropped it.
06bye
06lkdnkfd
2XD
06full screen sucks
06end of story
2XD
03well
03don'
2she's right
03For *movies* sure.
2then why, pray
03But TV shows...
Full screen is awesome when the proportions are right.
2is the Japanese image LONGER than the Dutch?
06TV shows are meant to be....well, TV
03I hate hwen they crop the top and bottom off TV shows
03WELL
06so, full screen is fine
2XD'
03Some movies, like before the 80s
06but movies should be widescreen
03were actually shot in fullscreen.
03And they cut the top and bottom off.
03for theaters
06lol
06fail
03because they're cheap/lazy
HAI
03I'm not kidding.
2:P
06I hate that
03I have ;a HUGE debate about that on Ultimatedisney
06I've seen amvs like that
2THe Dutch is cropped
03because they're saying the cropped one is proper as it was shown in theaters that way
06by a bit yeah
03why would they spend time and work drawing a full frame if we weren't meant to see it?
2XD
2LOL
06ok well whatever
2Drf
03what
2the top and bottom are cut off the DUTCHC
2-C
06x-x
03well as far as cropping, it's hard to tell. See how they redid the lines?
2well
2g'night
03Oh, you mean top and bottom?
2YES
03Bottom looks the same to me.
06oh yeah
06Kyu
06picture is sketched
07whee
2also the left and right XD
03And that oculd just be the fault of whoever took the screenshot, LOL
2drf
03well
07=3
2notice how you can see part of May's brother's arm in the Japanese
03see the vertical lines in the section under "Shopping"?
2look at the Dutch, all you see is his shirt
03They were different in Japanese./
2Yes
2I noticed that
03on his shirt
2XD
03it's more or less the same
2no
03What's possible is they aren't the exact same frame.
2Japanese is longer
2o3o
03Like one could be off by one or two.
03And that could very well cause it
2if memory serves
03if the camera was zooming in or out...
2in that screen, it pans left to right
03o.o
03could just be a cropped screenshot, I dunno.
2then how is the tip of May's bandana also cropped?
2exactly
03The *screenshot*
2XD
03I'm not saying the Dutch has more picture
03I'm saying the Japanese is different.
2o3o I realize that
2but I'm saying that the one that cuts the image off is the DUTCH
03Um
03but very barely
2:|
03ever heard of overscan?
03Ordinarily you wouldn't even SEE that part.
2:|
03Not sure why
03like I said, I didn't make the picture.
2XD
2o3o I know
2Well, if we're done
2I'd like to bid ye all a good night
'night people
07bai

10It would be sort of practical with ONE currency and way to measure, but sorta boring 8D
06Although it would be a pretty good idea, I laugh at the thought because I was told that like 25 years ago!!!
The US is the only developed country that hasn't.

hi TimeShift
/me wants to go back to sleep
06But my body doesn't.
06Now that I'm allowed to, I don't want to. >v>
/me is not here
06Whut movie?
06Ovo
06Who mentioned that?
/me hasn't seen DDR
06he's form that movie
06Lawl.
06from
06I got a letter wrong.
/me runs
06Hyourinmaru was a twin blade
06the other one was more purple in color and belongs to Kusaka
06Ah.
06I thought he could steal other people's Zanpakutous.
06So I killed him.
06>:D
/me flees before Toshirou kills her :O
06.....
06well no
06neither of them broke the rules
06because hyourinmaru called to both of them
06but because two of hyourinmaru by law couldn't exist, Kusaka and Toushiro fought
06one of those swords must be destroyed
06Well, that seems possible in every way.
06XD
06watch the movie, you'll understand
06o3o
06Nah.
06I'm slow.
06Not like a snail, though.

How are you?
07hihi
/me squeaks as he squeaks Quilava
/me eeps?
How are you?
12He doesn't even FRIKKIN CARE..
12Xai actually asked him "Aren't you sorry for all this!?" and he said no basically!!
07What?!
12and he still thinks everything that went wrong last night between him and Jess is me and that other girl's fault!1
07Argh the idiocy - now why is he trying to put the blame on you and that other girl?
07You have EVERY right to be peeved at him though!!
12Because she told Jess everything he's been doing behind her back and when Jess asked me why she said those things I confirmed it was the truth
oO
Well hopefully Jess is gonna withdraw sometime soon.
.
12No
12I'm tempted to invite her but I doubt she'd come without Tier -v-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I'll be back in an hour or so.Buh-bye.
Why wouldn't she go without Tier?
Even after all that's happened?
12Because she's naive and believes everything he's said to cover it all up
12After all.. he's done nothing but talk about me behind my back all these years....
now come on msn
no
12Why are you reading it then?
cus its all u talk about
LOl
12No one here is stupid you know, other than you of course

12Good <3

4Me too, I haven't met Jess.
12I'm playing matchmaker again XD sorry
4Isn't Jess with Tier?
4lol @ that.
maybe I can offer her being my roommate at the hotel
having someone to stay with is much more fun :)
4Yes, you're right.
12Yes she is but hopefully not for long >v>
12He's been planning to "ditch" her all this time anyway.........
12I wish she'd just leave him but she's far too attached
4Oh, ok.
12I've just gone and told her everything I know over the phone
12Everything he's ever said, everything he's ever planned and done..
4I do care though.
same here RN
12Jess is apparently just a "rebound relationship " >v>
4Hi Bunnyfox
4Oh, Tier has had relationships before?
4I assumed they were both their first relationships or something.
12No he hadn't
12*hasn't
4Oh...
12LOL HORO
4I didn't know that either.
12Yeh well there's a lot that people don't know about Tier becuase he hides it, he's another Falco
12He treats Jess the way I was treeated by Falco
4lol Horo, I didn't mean it to sound like that xD
4But meh.
peer's having a field day

Still stupidly expensive for lego
not really
7Waaaaaaaait, during WWI, did England want to harm Germany during the Treaty of Versailles? o.O
most large lego sets are expensive
eiffel tower is 150-200m tall isn't it?
no england didn't, as far as I can recall
12Hase anyone heard of LDD?
7Okay, BF.
England wanted to hurt them but not too much as we had a lot of trade with them
hmm
as it turned out that was the worst way to go
did we?
yes

2lawl
2o.
2o.o
/me huggles back
2bai drfy
Britain wanted to hit them hard, but not too hard as we wanted to still be able to trade
i thought it was nobody's route
hmm
ironically anyone else's would've meant to WW2
*no
iunno
If we'd gone France's way germany would've been too weak to possibly come back and cause WW2
Go America's way, they don't have reason to
Go our way, they had reason and ability to
"we spend all these years in miserable conditions to just forgive them like that?"
well it WAS everyone's fault
/me 7blinks
Germany probably did least to help but you can't put all the blame on them
but was it really the average persons fault?
Everyone, as in all the countries
huge arms races and the like
/me 7pokes Rora
6yeah?
7An optional other requirement is to do it to music, which I'd be interested in.
average people were making them, but yes. Though I wasn't referring to the average person, as I said
6what do you mean, "do it to music"?
6I'm not animating o_o
"everyone" as in it was all the european countries' faults
7Draw while music is playing, see how it affects.
7I have just the music in mind. O.o
6ll
6lol
7o.l
7o.o*
7Well, okay.
still pretty recent, I think
hmm
maybe
especially if it was a greater focus on "fairly" than "lightly"
maybe
even just removing the war guilt clause would probably have helped a lot
6quan
6you know how I've told you I hate KH music?
7o.O
7I see...
"you're not necessarily (sp) guilty but we're still going to punish you!"
6when you decide that let me know
necessarily spelt correctly there
7http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/6/64/Sa%C3%AFx-Artwork.jpg <-- Reference pics to the right, Rora.
and that was pretty much it, yeah
hmm, maybe
The kaiser didn't help to prevent the war much but neither did anyone else really
6hey, anyone know a good avi codev I can download?
If you want to import an AVI into anything using DS or WFV, try ffdshow.
*VFW
VLC is great
iirc France had the largest army/most expensive army (can't remember which, but it was either something in between the two or one of those two) prior to WW1 and WW2
and also, virtualdubmod didn't recognise the codecs used by the mkv I want to convert, or something along those lines
Russia had the biggest by a huge margin
had at least 100% on top of anyone else
hmm
all this talking is making my think that my GCSE history was balls
or at least the figure's something like that. they had, IIRC, at least 2 million soldiers on top of anyone else
my old history book used to be behind me but now it's down in my room. It also has these figures in it
we didn't even have a book
jsut lots of cutting and sticking ~__~
*just
not a textbook, exercise book
23:06 Bloatedfish â¢ we didn't even have a book
23:06 Bloatedfish â¢ jsut lots of cutting and sticking ~__~
23:06 Bloatedfish â¢ *just
I had the figures cut and stuck in :P
oh
right
history as a school subject is fairly boring
it's nice to read about though
well that failed epically
hurr
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/
barkbarkbark
6quan, did you decide?
7Draw which one's easier. :3
6yeah, I was asking which you wanted

Horo o.o
yeah, very similar to that, got extremely annoying rather quickly I found
Yeah I can see why
it's very repetitive
the actual mission briefing IIRC is similar but slightly different
the combat music though was truly quite epic
maybe it was a ploy to get people to play the actual missions more
Skies of Liberation isn't it?
Fires of Liberation, at least for UK edition
Fires of Liberation, then
hey, it's close, and I think some places may have called it skies
for some reason the AC series seems to have had a lot of local names
Well I wish I could play them on my own, but fail sight is fail - I played 5 through with Arrow which was awesome
Lol well I can't see my own plane!
Like, where I'm aiming
yeah, I can see why it would :P
lol
arharh
I heard Zero was good aswell?
Yeps
Oh Horo
Why aren't you Airwolf anymore
And I've only actually played 6, the one on 360
why the change?
I could change back
Was just wondering
=)
want to call me air wuff some more? =P
Air wuff!
Yes!
/me wuffs at Horo
EeeWolf
oO
whut
I''m on an Eee
Ok
OH!
Now I get iiiit
also
Now I shall listen to moosik
and I shall play AC6 while my sister goes through GHIII on medium and Win7 installs on the desktop
Hm
thats some weird expansion name
THe first expansion was The Lost and Damned
until right at the end they just put it in full view
Hey Androo
Hm
Which plane is it EeeWolf?
Su-47, but a slightly custom version which makes it about as strong as a newspaper but as manoeuvrable in normal conditions as other planes are under high-G mode
LOL!
Newspaper
in high-G mode this thing does backflips. And then stalls due to lack of speed
I wish I could play now XD
And I take it
since the plane's defenses aren't the greatest that won't benefit unskilled pilots well
;p
But to ones with experience it'll do wonders!!

04Sorry I haven't been on lately
LET THERE BE "SULTANS OF SWING!"
02xD
awww... it should have been NSFW ;>
/me hides
04One word: Spore
12It's standard for all companies to call a mobile if they have it
/me flees
04Because then, I can design an adventure about VCS!
02:O
02:U
02Anyway
bler. i gtg
02I'm going back to figure out this freaking encryption thing on HTS D:
02D:
04Dragon RP, I know
02nuuu
04Cya 591
baiz, pplz...
/me huggles everyone tightly and poofz
04I won't
02If you REALLY do want to know, PM me.
02Although I'm not sure you'll really want to hear it...
02xD
02Arti lol
02that old lol
04Uhh...NS
04There is really nothing I can post about
04BTW
02hm?
04Actually, don't worry about it
02xD
02argh I never really bothered looking into Encryption
02Pirate it :U
04NEVA
02Torrent + Download = win
04Besides
02then fare with not getting it :P
04My birthday is in a month
02k
04ty
04PC*
04and brb
02k
02aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh I hate MySQL!
12lol
02o-o
02...and PHP too,
02I need to "restudy" encryption/decryption D:
02After this, I realise how much I suck at that particular area
02hi Horo
02rawr
02Damnit, I really shouldn't be on HTS today D:
04back
02wb
02I'm still stuck on this
04ty
04lol
02And I'm thoroughly annoyed
/me wants to learn to use WMM
02Haven't had anything to do with encryption for about 6 months now
02lol WMM
02It's not that hard
02Use logic, and you can use it
02:P
04Yeah, thing is I have nothing to use it for
04That's why I don't know how to use it
hi :)
02FUUUUUUUUU
02D:
04WHOA!
04Calm down
02DDDDDDD:
04You're reminding me of creature stage
04freaking crashes
02and I got a BlSoD
02yeah
04BISwhat?
02BL
02not BI
04What does that mean?
02-_-
/me facepalms
02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Screen_of_Death
02why did that even happen?
/me REBOOTS
02...fffs
02Another BSoD
02BlSoD*
02;O
02eh
/me wants to both use WMM, and be able to make awesomeoe signatures/avatars/wallpapers
02wat
02wat
02wat
04?
wmm for signatures?
02Drake, lrn2pirate Photoshop :U
o.O
02lol
04-_-
02nah
02PS CS3 ftw
04I have Photoshop on my laptop
02CS4 is fairly retarded lol
02which version?
04CS4
04NNGH
04But I don't have my Laptop atm
04It's at freaking school getting repairs
02;o
02Your school gives you laptops too?
02Like, you have to buy one?
04Yeah, the school gives it too us for fees
04I got a Mac
02eww mac
02^Why I hate it
04Same
02Personally, I can't use anything else besides Vista and XP
02and I hate Vista
02I have XP on my laptop
02xD
04The thing is...
use Win7
02...Macs suck.
02I want Win7
02except downloading it from a torrent
02would kill me
04The reason I want to learn to use WMM and make sigs/avis/ect is I got some massive inspiration from seeing some peoples adventure advertisements on the Spore Forums
02and I know I have to get my laptop reimaged soon
02:O
Win7 amazed me with performance increase in games and other places
02k
02lol HoRo
02Horo*
02well
04And I want to make my own Adventure based around VCS
02it's said that Win7 is good
04Eh?
now it's more 20-30 on the same machine
02and atm, it's the safest
02...meaning the safest from cracking/hacking
02lol
/me rages at her other computer
02lol hi TS
02AAAAAAAAAAARGH
02personally, I want to kill this BlSoD
02D:
04lol
02hm
04Well, if it is already "of Death" then you really can't kill it
/me flees
02LOL
hi Nightshadow
02^^
02hi TS
02hm
04Eh? TimeShift?
02I haven't loaded this comp for about a year
02yeah
04OH, hey TS
04NS
02?
04Another reason WMM is alien to me is because I use UnFreez for all my animating
02lol
04I would actually use WMM if I didn't have UnFreez
02I've never used UnFreez before lol
02:O
04UnFreez is kinda difficult
04But easy at the same time
02WMM is retarded, end of story
02as are most other movie making programs
04Because they NEED to be GIF. files
04You open Windoes Explorer and UnFreez...
02lol
04?
02Go delete System32 8D
/me flees
04Dun worry
02xD
02xD
02go delete System32 though
02LOL
02well
04>.>
12don't listen to nightbunneh D:
02xD
04Uhh...
02NO U
02Okay
04Que?
04...
12and then you'll kill nightshadow
12so no one really wins
/me is lost in this conversation
02I think it also contains explorer.exe
/me flees
02But I can't remember
02hurr
04Yeah, but then I'll get Dyan onto you
04And don't even think about Kommander Kulez
04Because then I'll get Velimoth
/me flees faster
02xD
02THEN I'LL GET MYSELF AND KILL YOU 8D
04lol
02LOLOLOLOLOLOL
02xD
04I win cuz:
04"CAN'T TOUCH DIS!"

02lol yes
12Lyon
02but that doesn't really matter
12do you want to see Nightshadow as a bunneh?
02since my IP changes a lot
02fudge.
It's surprisingly easy to get people's IPs
02Exactly.
04Yush
02xD
02yeah I know that lol
04But WTH
02Unfortunately I don't have an onion router lol

LOL
My bank is being very retarded lately
4Howcome?
4Mine are quite lenient which surprises me
02:O
02hi RN
Well I purposely left £30 in there for yesterday and today (yesterday Snooker, and today halloween party) checked the account yesterday and it said £45.84 OVERdrawn o.o
/me sighs
04I'm gonna play Spore
4heya
02wat
04Cya
04As in VCS
04Bai
don't they normally have a delay before the money is actually there?
4LLOTS, just write a sob story letter to them, it works at my bank
No I left £30 in my bank from my last payment
Horo
4Most of them it's just money money money, people = nothing, but mine is ok.
The money WAS in the account
did you make sure?
Yes
how?
..
Then check on the day I wanted it
The money was in my account, but £75 has been taken out at some point
02brb
And I know that £75 wasn't the money I paid to Arti for the train tickets (the statements show that)
02back
Possibly, going down the bank today to check
4Remember they usually close at 12.
Yeah I'm leaving at 11 :>

Don't ask me why , it's maybe due to the Swiss richness...
6Ah.

6I dont try to kill you.
It's spinning time ?
/me 6extends his Razor-sharp Wings.
/me 6Motions them In and Out, his wings acting like Scissors.
And not only me.
6Then show them it out of Knowledge.

Any animal , but not humans , because they limit themselves to control the world.
/me 6Nods.
6True, but even then, it's Nearly-Impossible to.
6Yeah.

Did we really evolve ? We are the more clever creatures around there , we have power , but not reason...
We can make the world explode if it could be a nice money earning maneer.
6Yep.
i just devoured cynder 10 mins ago..

What's the HTML code to make font smaller?
6There
7also in six year old Hail
6o.o
<font size="blah"></font>
I got that far
but I can't shrink the font
0.5 and 1/2 don't work
Uhmm... probably 1?
if it was 1 you wouldn't be able to see or read it
probably around 12
'normal' text is 12 pt
try putting it at 8
dude
o.o;; But 2 is default
you don't use decimals
6*sighs*
Maybe it's not 2 pt
copying and scaling up to a more readable size?

I can only find DotD , at least it's not nothing.
Futurama ? I know the reputation of this website...
eh, it's nice lol
i only like the difficulty in TEN
07u is odd
07that's wat this is
it's damn hard D:
Wow , that could cost a LOT buying all these games...
I didn't even like that
7I could, actually.
I like difficult, but not frusterating and repetitive
try
7Naw.
then you can't do it lol
i wait until most games are $20 or less except for my favorites
7Try using magic, NS. :3
/me runs
Yeah I know
but he blocks a lot
The only thing it was good for was pretending the monkeys were people you're angry at :)
7Have Elixirs.
and if he hits you twice then it's over
and magic takes too long to cast
I did that sometimes
7Naw.
well i had a few other games but sold them
Seriously, try it, and tell me when you beat him lol
7No, NS; it'd take too much time for even a single round.
lolwhy?
7I can't do that. Like when people tell you just pretend the brick is someone you dislike. I just can't overlay imagination over reality.
7Try Believe's challenge.
Believe's Challenge isn't that hard
Xion's battle mission thing is harder
http://www.playvee.com/
7Both of them?
4lmao
We weren't allowed to have any "real" games on wii

7The two challenges I can't seem to get are the ones with the imposter.

7And you can get an oricalcum(sp), too.
I think the last time I played one was when I went over to a friend's room and played Halo
I have about 50, sadly
7Meh, me too, but I keep them in case I have t'make any of the rings and stuffs.
7Ugh. Halo.

7Invisible.

About ma , it was to be a master at the sequel of one of my favorites games...I've lost interest and regain it a lot , but no longer for now.
lol
7Fine, mission 85.
it always gives me Gust Gems though D:
7NS, different missions give different rewards.
ahk
Halo...I've played a little at the 3 this afternoon...No fun this time , because my friends weren't here.
I didn't think it was that fun

Though I admit trying to install it. .sdrawkcaB
That may have fried it or something
but truth is,
no one knows
maybe it wasn't compatable for the motherboard?
The RAM I got was from Kingtston
and acording to the web site it should be the right one
And I already have the same model of RAM in there
I pulled the SD card out when it was still plugged in. now it wont read the cards -_-;
Ich
12Betowolf
12are you at all very familiar with DA?

Somewhat here
You can't
They stupidly disabled the ability to add more than one when you remove one of either two
12sigh
I should be sighing
I fried my RAM
*nods*

Suck suck suck
I fried it months ago
I NEED 4GB OF RAM NAO.

I rather not use 64 bit ^_^;
12yeah it does

/me climbs up on articuno's wing and onto her back
6and believes it herself
point and laugh
12Dunno.
12She's not exact being a very nice friend to me
-_-;
/me is hungry
12If she was mature, she wouldn't take sides. She'd tell him to drop it and she'd drop it herself.
12She would continue as normal with me and Xai
12But she's actually causing us problems
12It's his bad influence.
arti
Wow. jess is such a jerk! =/
best to block her, arti
12>v>
12She was my best friend thanks.
-_-;
I see
It's not as simple as things look
07Agreed
6unfortunate as it is
/me sighs
12if you can't beat them, join them
-_-
6:/ that is a bit extreme
/me sighs
6because of her situation
6while I admit dropping it would be best, I can see why she continues
this sucks.
6stupidly, but yes
07Mm
07oyu might know me best like this

AHHH LEEEKSPIN ON MY TV

Only 256 GB RAM?
enough for a server in fact
lol there's no ram of that amount xD
shouldn't 64-bit be able to take around 16 billion GB?
03why would you need that much RAM?
lol
wut
03well TimeShift, you're the one who's paranoid about security, you should avoid Windows-based servers like the plague
You wouldn't. But it should in theory be capable of that
why drf?
it's a myth they'd be unsafe in fact
12Ok guys site's fixed..
12I wish I could find out why /forum doesn't work on Php5 but com_smf does..

12Hey
Heya all ^^'
I tried a few FF games. I'm at least semi-obsessed with not having uncompleted games yet I can't be bothered to complete any of them
07Why not?
07Any good?
07I might have to be forced through FF7...
I just don't find them fun or interesting
07Like how they're structured
lol
XII is particularly bad. I was just about ready to give up on it entirely, then the memory card borked and gave me an excuse
07LOL Horo that works too
I like FF12
I COULD replay it from the start, but I'm not gonna
I actually liked the beginning (somewhat), but the later parts and vast amount of grind put me off entirely
1235? Are you sure?
12i thought it was 10
According to the discography on mininova yeah
12*17 even
12I have 17 of them
Then yeah 35
12There aren't 35 I checked the page myself XD
Over 4GB of music in the discography
07LOL
07Eeeeeeeeek
12Thats including Phil Collins on his own I think.
07X_____x
link?
12It also includes all the live music and specials
07Lemme see if I can find it uploaded somewhere
12I'm sure there are only 17 albums
Not sure XD
03my friend has it
03it's actually legit
12I have all their albums :>
07Actually
07Hold on

Speaking of TimeShift
07>____>;
Hullo
eh?
Thanks to you I thought RN's mate was a FEMALE >.>
07WHAT LOL
07HOW DID YOU DO THAT
07I NEVER SAID HE WAS FEMALE LOL
Because you only used his last name!!
07And his last name is feminine how? oO
07I thought I was supposed to be polite
07and when you do that you sue last names
07*use
It sounded like "Bernette" or something, geez!
07Loooooooooooooool oops
With you I'm never sure @_@
lol bernette
No one :o
07ANYWAY
07Arrow i think you're fleeb

12Just remembered..
12It's been a year since I moved in with Xai..
07Hm?..
12A year today
12Yeh this time last year I think we were still on the road.. driving up here
/me lights a candle
Draw a pic to commemorate the anniversery

07Fiiish
07Okies

07Arrow - I fail twice
Fail squared?
I told you she looks a little Gothic!!
12What colour did you think it was?
12>v>
12I do not..
Er
I didn't say anything
07LOL that picture particularly you might, just a bit
07No
04LOL
12I don't look the slightest bit gothic in that pic >v>
oh Arti?
12It looks a bit like that because of the lighting :>
12yes?
/me votes that the picture be retaken then. =P
I think I'll give you a call before I takeoff. My mobile provider FINALLY lowered the rates
from 1.83 euro/minute for everything within the EU to 12 cents/minute
12Haha nice
yeah, that's kinda a discount^^
07^-^
/me huggles back
07And yeah wow timeshift that's lowering them a lot
It's more than just that, it's mainly the pose and the hair colour too
She looks far less gothic in practically every other photo I've seen
o.O
07that's just my opinion though
07sdgjkhsdfg
07XD
That, perhaps, is one of the girliest things I've heard you say.
07LOL
07well I AM female Arrow
07what do you excpect honestly
You've always insisted you're more of a tomboy though.
CROSS OVER, KACHEEK! CROSS OVER INTO THE LIGHT
07Yeah, but I'm still female, and still 'allowed' a few things that sort of fall beside that ;P
:3
07BEOWULF.

10Strict parents are strict >_>
I mean isnt that GOOD?
that's one away from an A!
10And yeah, 89% isn't too bad
12Stuff like that doesnt happen in Englanf
10"You are capabale of doing better!"
12*England
89's pretty good!
10capable*
14k.
12I've noticed it seems to only be American parents for some reason that want straight A's and nothing more.. it's terrible..
10But honestly, I'd rather not be in honour classes
12Parents should encourage their children not punish them if they are doing "badly" at school
10that results in alot of homework, etc
12agreed, Arti
I kno!
lol I resemble that remark
07either overly lazy or overly strict
-_- This is why I want to travel.

5I really don't like it when moms go all overdrive to the point they don't trust their kid(s)' friends, and even, like in my case, their kid(s).
Hopefully I can do it again.
Last year's was quite fun.
6Yeah..
5I WAS NINE YEARS OLD
5I had no friends IRL
6She's just scared of getting it cause she's not fimilliar with it or something..-.-

LOL
07LOL Sky
10LOOOL

After I finish my lunch I have to do a voice acting audition for an online independent animation company.

Brb, e-mailing the Card XChange

/me breaks free
5Sometimes I do mean it...
/me still got caught though...
-_-
5Now usually when she says I'm acting immature I just laugh. Because, usually when that happens, she's acting less mature than me at the time.
04I hate Jazz Dx
/me is blasted
5The laugh's mostly inwards, because if it's too loud I get tons of annoying idle threats spat out at me >>

05hi Dragryphon
7You keep listing things that have happened to either 1/3 of people or 99% as if they were specially deisgned to get YOU down.
5I'm not saying they were, I know they stress other people. Don't you think it'd be nice for once to consider that you're not the best person on earth?

5ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
5That would be epically random.
5>> <<
5-went into random mode-
7are not sports.
6Why,the day that my friend'll finally go online againa and I would be able to do an effing videocall with her I have to get kicked off?
7and seriously. No matter how people want to wish it, 95% of skateboarding is NOT extreme
5It's just sliding around on a board with wheels and hurting yourself.
6Well,at least that's over with
7and motor sport. People are like 'you have to be fit to do it!!!!111apple' and I'm just 'Yes, but it's not EXERCISE, stupid twifags.'
It was where I went with my friend, you try dropping in off a 12ft half-pipe.
/me yawns
5...Zomg random apple
/me 5steals the apple and runs.
7if anything, professional 2 ton pie-eating is more extreme than skateboarding
7The apple is a twitard joke
5Exactly o_i
5o_o*
...
Again, you try dropping in off a 12 ft half-pipe.
Because TBH, I doubt you have the balls.
7It's completely unnecessary and has no reason for being there.
7Dari: no. That's not extreme, that's stupid.
Lol, look up extreme?
"Sports: Very dangerous or difficult"
7Russian roulette is dangerous. still not extreme.
6And I'm like seriously the only person that doesn't go out like at least 15 times a month
7I could say the same to you.
I have dictionaries on my side.
Lol.
yo
AERO
hi
6Ugh
7I have common sense and logic on my side.
5Wow, ink on paper
7The vulcans win I'm afraid
/me dies
6Hopefully she didn't see I was online
/me 5slams her head into the keyboard.
/me must go over there to have a cheezburger
6Hooray for the option of blocking people
14hmmm...is mountian boarding consittiered a sport?
7Again. Extreme. Learn the meaning of this. Stupid.
Just because an extreme sport is stupid, doesn't mean it's not extreme.
7No, you don't.
7Not once have I ever seen you do that
If someone has explicitly proved that something I've said is wrong, I'll acknowledge that.
And how often have I been on here recently?
7Ah. There you go. You'll only admit you're wrong if there's undeniable evidence, and no-one can be bothered to do that
LOL, now that's just a stupid thing to say. If I have an opinion on something, then I can't be wrong, it's my own personal opinion.
05hi Touridor
If it's something factual, then if someone proves that I'm wrong, fine.
roar
hi Sammacha :3
05hi Latias_loves_yew

Using silly made up words still doesn't make you right.
/me 7asplodes

7BAH.
hahaha hey touridor
boo?
5Jeeze, now everyone's confusing me.
7What I said. It's a text based conversation. Repetition of something recorded two centimeters up is not necessary
05why
for resons that deny my imagination
/me 5now remembers why she doesn't come online on SF/SC much anymore.
6Now I'm confuzzled too
This is the first time I've been on in a while.
5Same here.
Excuse me?
7You're excused.
Why would I?
/me 5doesn't even remember when she came on last
/me hops onto Lugia's head
Twitard isn't in any dictionary.
/me dances

ohaifjdlkasl;kfasjd
7No, but you could use one to figure it out.
Heya ;>
7Common sense and a bit of intelligence.
6Now she's telling me off for even asking for ePSXe again..
6D<
SILENCE.
bananababy: You clearly missed the point.
5The logic they use, which usually defines, in their eyes, that they're always right.
5>>
5What point is there?
7You know, you're just being a total retard because you know I'm right and are trying to completely derail the conversation
nice lugia591
Well my logic wasn't that I was always right.
thnx to a certain "Welcome Newbies" post XD*shot*
7No, that was you, being an idiot.
7again.
7surprisingly.
05iihows it going?
7Again, I could say the same to you.
2wb?
<.>
07wb sammich =3
/me 14taps C7
thanks
5Sorry, but I don't think this should even be going on, honestly, all it's turning into now is arguing for the sake of arguing...
Extreme. "Very dangerous or difficult". Falling off a 12ft half-pipe, dangerous.
Therefore, extreme.
/me 7yawns
sammich.....
/me noms on a sammich
7So, you just fall off it on purpose? That's stupid, not extreme.
wb sammcha
/me was nommed
05its all Kyu's fault
...You know that I mean if you fall of while dropping in on a skateboard.
/me 5believes that what's going on now is just as stupid as that.
>:D
off*

14o.=.O
5I know I'm not on completely nice terms with either of you, but please, it makes it worse if you continue
5I'm begging,
4Just stop.
5><
5And keeping it going is going to make it worse.
7Yes, as you fully understand the term and have used it yourself.
14Guys....why cant you argue with eachother in a PM on Mibbit? -.=.-
...No I haven't.
Ever.
I know for a fact I have never/would never use such a stupid term.
14-.=.-
/me 14facepalms.

I can send it to you if you want.

lol
13Btw, does anyone know how to use GIMP here?
10lol
yeah i saw that as 1 of the requests
tokio hotel that is
-_- to lazy to even search it up right now
13dari: is it possible to do layers on there, i.e. lines of something on the top, colors below it? I think I've seen people do it on there on tutorials, but I dunno how to do it
13mmkay thanks
What's the latest version of GIMP, I might have an old one?
I have 2.5.6
2.4.6*
13No idea, but I have gimp 2.6
13oh
13ffff there's only two numbers for me
Should still be pretty much the same.
Open the file you want to have layers on.
Select the window it's in, and press Ctrl+L
13k
The layers window should come up.
The arrows are to move layers up and down.
13Cool, I think I got it
13thank youuuu
Ok.
No problem.
You really should just get PS CS4 TBH.
Don't need to get a torrent.
You download the free trial off their site.
Then replace one 2MB .dll

4Don't you'll get fox flu!! but thanks :)
4LOLOL
/me wonders how an ice burd can keep someone warm o.o
12RN we looked over the balcony yesterday and saw a FOXXY!!!!!
XD Sorry
4Awesome!
12XD
12LOL
4Wouldn't that cook them?
4Nice! Sometimes we get hedgehogs.
4We also have bats around here.
/me runs
Yeah, we get bats too.
12Same, bats are nice <3
4Foxes get spines in them if they hedgies.
4chew*
We have quails
4Failquails?
hello
They don't seem to be very common here.
4Cute - which county do you live in, if you don't mind me asking?
England.
I'm near Reading.
4Awesome, I meant county not country, sorry.
Yo.
Wtf.
Oh right, lol.
Berkshire.
I'm watching A Haunting.
12No one calls it East Yorkshire because Yorkies don't want to be associated with Hull LOOOL
12It's called Humberside to us XD
My grandmother is from Yorkshire.
12LOL
@_@
4LOL Humberside no longer exists, since 1996.
4We hate it on our letters :P
Sheffield.
12Really, RN?
12Sheffield fails epically..
12South and East Yorkshire should NOT be considered Yorkshire..
12>v>
/me yawns
4Yeah, it really irritates us to have 'North Humberside' on our letters, it's officially East Yorkshire.
4Why? :P
4We were here before you, shove off, haha xD
/me runs
4Now if only tribes had said that to the English...
12XD
12But it was the romans that took over the English :O
12So the romans are to blame for everything LOL
12I suck at history
4and the druids took over the foxies
4I wish we still had wolves here...
Go to a zoo. :P
4I don't like them in a zoo, lol.
Probably because wolves hunt for pleasure, even when they're not hungry.
4Yeah but that's their nature, can't really blame them for that.
4It's still annoying in the mornings though...
And we aren't allowed to have dogs rip foxes apart from horseback? It's in our nature. :P
4It's only in cruel people's nature in fairness.
4Let's not get into that again haha.
)*
/me falls asleep
<Rocket_Ninetales> It's only in cruel people's nature in fairness. I don't understand.
4The reason wolves go after people is because we hunt too much of their prey in the first place - well not the official reason but my theory. And we encroach too much onto their land.
They don't got after people.
go*
4Some wolves do I think. But only if sick or something, not sure.
lmao! I havn't done that in a long time since there hasn't been any worthwhile wii games since may
"In a three week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten."
4But fair enough.
lol
4All animals are sentient.
4But yeah.
4I guess we just don't understand their behaviour as much as we'd like, perhaps?
4Oh sorry I misunderstood the word 'sentient' - I thought it meant concious.
4Hi MooreHorn
4Dogs have compassion.
hiho :)
Example?
And I meant wolves having compassion.
nvm
4Ok.
4Well I guess they don't.
the pm oh i wrote an episode of the dare show months ago never posted on the forum ....oh now ya say nvm lol
They would kill most of species in an area for fun if they had compassion.
wouldn't*
4I'm not usually the debating type, sorry, I always lose at it.
lol sry
zzzzzzzzzz
Hello Rocket_Ninetales =)
12Right just finished making dinners
12*eats(
4What did you make?
12Chicken burgers with salad and cooked lentils. Bit of a mixture
oh wait lmao i did post that online but on another forum
4Nice!
12What kind?
4There's different kinds?
4I only know of one, haha.
Yeah, it's that kind of thing that can be argued one of many ways, but can't be explicitly proved in one.

SMF is also like TST :P
lol
10Fine, and you?
Exactly
We tried PHPBB already
02Tired
And you know how much that...sucked -.-
I'm doing good
actually
SAD!!!!
Well honestly
phpBB is win
I'd get IPB if I could... but damn, it's like $200
php > phpBB
XD
10Oh, my bad >_<
IPB?
lol
02She is pretty busy tbh...
10Yeh
Are you going to tell me, or laugh at me? O_o
10I've already requested that WH pose (which she was clearly agrrevated with since they wouldn't accept it) and a Flygon-wolf
it's another forum software
xD
lol
did you put the image I gave you in?
no
Oh.
k
there's a few other ones
/me doesn't ask her for pictures, for many reasons
phpbb and smf are best free ones.
and tbh i'd kinda like to break away from the TST-style
10Can I ask why?
10Roara likes ideas
10I gave her a few suggestions in the past
10And wow, NewberryTiger's drawings on the forums are cool
02Yeah
/me spazz-flees
10dA?
sdfakjdkjasdf
I need to go
well
IPB would be good
10Ah
but pirating it would be sad
Pirating is good.
:P
of course
but for an actual site...>.>

It hasn't been good in a few years, though.
7I drew myself with my zodiac sign. O_o

02Kyu, wanna see my Zodiac?
10I prefer the originals

02There
7O_o*
It had some really fun episodes
7I can post my incomplete doodledump, but you'll have to look through all of my KH fanart. X3
10The one movie they aired recently on CN was dumb
10Scooby Doo: The Mystery Begins
02Yes, I didn't even watch it
02Commercials were enough to turn me away >.

10Pup Named Scooby-Doo. 8D
7Whoo, my doodledump still hasn't loaded.
7Yes?
o_O
02I'm kind of mad that Dialga got about 3 movies to star in
6yeah, well
6it's a trilogy >_>
7KY
7U
02Yeah, well none of the others got it
7Dang, why can't I hit that U? D:
6stop complaining >_>
/me 6runs
02Me? Sorry
Dialga isn't very special, either.
07?
02I just said that
6well...they're freaking origin creatures
7I got my incomplete doodledump
6of course they get the trilogy
7http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/850/doodledump.png <-- Note; there are oldish, newish, and KH stuffzors. O_o
6I'm not the franchise operators
7But mostly Marly, Demyx, and Vexen. O_o
6HE HECK?
6THE
6DFKJFD
6it's pronouced "Ar-kee-us" >_>
7O_o?
7Not Ar-kay-us? O_o
6nope
6...
6>_>
02I still pronounce it Are-see-us
6^that
7o_o
/me lols
7Whenever you see a 'ce', it's usually pronounced 'see'..
6yeah
02Ce = "see" or "se"
...you guys don't get it
02Usually as Quan pointed out
6Andy, I just explained why I don't
You don't see an /r/ before the "ce" very often, do you?
6...
/me 7facepalms at Andyman
7What does an R have to do with anything?
7The word 'scarce', for example.
The phonemes before and after certain other phonemes determine how they are pronounced and also
7You don't pronounce it 'scark', do you?
...which phonemes are reasonable by the structure of the word
That's because there's nothing after it
7What about 'scarcer', then?
You have a point with that
hallo
02Not to me
o_O
lol wrongness
laaaaaaaaaaaaag
02Don't care
6hey that's fine
6I don't pronounce dialga "daialga"
6..
-.-'
6*deealga
6I pronounce it daialga
02same lol XD
6and for the longest time, I said "keeoger" for kyogre
7I pronounced 'kai-oh-ger' and 'dee-alga' .3oo
7o3o(
7o3o*
I say "Kyogre" the same way I've always said "Kyu" lol
7O.o
also computer is on low battery D:
6I used to say "soo-ee-cune"
6not putting the first two together
02Not minority anymore Andyman
"Are-see-us" just doesn't sound... godly
7Not in the English language, maybe.
6sounds more godly than arkeeus imo
02^this lol
6also
uh, Noah's ark
Bible, etc.
6japanese pronunciation had the "see" in it
7Sounds like 'arcane'.
6which is where I got it
Let me reiterate: the phonemes in Japanese and English differ a LOT
6that's cool
6I'm calling it how I want
Both are very fascinating languages

12like Warcraft
12lol ok
12have you ever heard of Starcraft 2!
10nope LOL
/me 12is EXTREMITY surprised
12WHAT!!!
12XD
10XD
12its one of the best games in the world...
12even if it isn't released yet
12your right Qiulava
12have you ever heard of StarCraft Quilava?
yes. and I was terrible at it.
12lol
12how about StarCraft 2?
2o-0
12Ovo
12has anyone heard of the 12/12/12 theory?
that there are actually twelve twelves on that day?!
12lolwut
12I mean 2012
because it aint
12lol yes...
07lol
07they say millions of things
12yes
12yes they do
eh I heard something else.
12XD OMG
though, astronomers haven't seen any planet nearby capable of that
12that is soo false
not really.
12Exactly!!!
12I do!
12anyone think that an alien invasions happening on earth is very rare, raise there hand.
rare yes, impossible, no
/me 12raises hand
it hasn't happened yet. thats all you need to know
not really.
I could explain it if you want.
12the only reason that an invasion would happen is ether for ruling or resources.
doesn't have to be an invasion even.
12???
chances of meeting another alien species
12is about 2%?
lol
12lol
Lower
you'd need to attach that percent to a time frame.
unless it bends spacetime.
07doesn't seem practical for any species to try
12well...
12there is a way to travel faster then light...
actually, I read on the net that scientists discovered that subatomic particles defy the constant speed of light
12it is very complex.
12Tachyons
is that a theory, or actually proven?
probably
12I think it was proven that they travel faster then light?
12but there slowest speed is as fast as light
/me coughs
07theory~

Why do people always collapse at the comemoration service? Someone did last year too.
4Flaming = a lesser version of saying a word when angry
03what two minute silence?
12OvO;;;
03Oh
12We have a two minute silence here in the UK on November 11th
03what for?
03Yes
12Rememberance Day
vets day
03oh
03I've seen it happen
I'm in the UK
It's freezing.
03because you're standing at attention or w/e

12Ovo
03oh, that
03I've esen it
03*seen
4Ah ok
12I hate rap but I know you can't have rap without the swearing XD
03well there's plenty of clean rap, it just seems to not be popular
03Yes you can!
12You physically can but like you said, it's not popular
12It sucsk LOL
12Even more than normal rap
03well
4They rap their order at the drive through
12XD
03it seems now a lot of hip-hop music is going back to where it used to be - somewhat clean
12I can appreciate rap, it's raw talent. But I don't like it myself.
no one wants to listen to rap if they aren't dropping the F-bomb every other line
03no swearing
12lol
12XD
03which is a good thing
12Never heard of any of those HAHA
03because I think hip-hop artists finally got over that whole thing
12<downloading orders>
12At least we get Harry Potter before you :O
12LOOOL
03LOL
03wait, the movies or the books

03I still need to make an alternate version of that song
03and remove the word "iPod' from the chorus
/me hides
12hello TS ^v^
hey
03but seriously, it's possible. I just need an acapella/instrumental
03and last time I checked they didn't exist...
12hi TimeShift
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m34xyw8E-Qs <-- This is another one

cya
12bye?
12I can't wait!!
12I really can't!
12I am preparing a few things
same
12I'll tell you one of them
/me puts Clint Eastwood back on

12I've been listening to this
12LOL
12A lot of ?'s
10Alt!
10Sup
03like all his songs reeked of LimeWire
03well anyway
12hello llots ^v^
03I was like "ooh, Cascada"
03start listening to this one track
12He didn't format it?
03and I was like, WTF is this
03and looked, the song didn't even exist
12Ovo
03he had it tagged as a remix of Everytime We Touch, despite the lyrics being COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
03So I used my song ID program
03turns out it's a completely different person
03>_>
03I stole all 27GB of his music ^_^
12Ovo;;
>:*
12idk
03well, that mp3 player has issues. There's a huge dent in the back, and I have a feeling the hard drive is corrupted as even with Rockbox on it it takes like 20 seconds to load a song >_>
03if I could find a cheap 1.8" hard drive I'd swap the thing out, maybe with a SSD even
nm, installing cod:mw2 :D
you?
I just stick to cheap mp3 players to be honest
got a 2gb one and a 2gb iPod nano
03EW IPODS
03Right now I'm using an 8GB Sansa e280, $75
I don't bother with these pathetically overpriced Mp3 players lol
03iPod Touch was the only one that didn't completely suck, but even then they aren't that great
03Zune HD is the most amazing thing ever, though
4I just use an mp3 player that funnily enough plays music xD
03and I need at least like, 80GB of music
/me runs
03EW IPHONES
03Lugia365, ever heard of the Droid?
12Ovo
12huh?
03OMG
03hold on
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPYM-XTqcec
<%drf|laptop> and I need at least like, 80GB of music <<< lol I would hate having an mp3 player with that much memory, 1-8GB is all i need
03LOL
03Well
12Ovo
03hence why I'm gonna get the 120GB one ^_^
4lol only kidding
4or*
03My first one DID get stolen
03that's why I have this Sansa, LOL, as a backup
4Did you use the Saw technique on the culprit?
4If not, why not!
03...
4lol
RN that's one of the reasons why I avoid high-tech mp3 players :P
03it was my own fault though
4Same with me with phones
03because I left it out when I went to use the bathroom
03came back, and it was gone
03*FTW
03I usually have a ton of valuables with me
4Then again I'd just bite their hands or something...
12brb
03like now, my laptop, my phone, this mp3 player, a bunch of cash in my wallet, my debit card, my MOM's credit card...
4that freaks people out and usually they run away lol
03LOL
03It's really common sense
4I HAVE to
03I take the buses everywhere
03and o.o why?
03so, go to somewhere bette rlit
03*better lit
4There isn't anywhere like that here LOL
03fail
03the roads, mainly
4my shoes or something? lol
4Ok night LLOTS
03if you go the same streets
03Heh
Does it really matter if it's well lit in America though? You never really know when someone is going to go loony with a gun.
03so we let her
03LOL
Anyway night all
03prince-dari, only in Detroit.
4Go around with a bullet proof vest and a helmet lol
Lol.
03they could still shoot you in the foot
/me runs
4probably
03they don't know that
03they'd assume you have a wallet at least
Wear steel plated shoes.
03whose fault is that?
/me runs
03but seriously, I think most people are just paranoid
4Why would I need to? lol
4Don't need my phone, don't need money.
/me runs
03whoen in reality like, less than 1% are
03*when
10not homework
10lol
03just like how I don't think most strangers are out to get you
03they're probably just minding their own business too
03and LOL yeah I know my parents are stupid
03Heck
03I'm the only one that hasn't LOL
Most adults aren't out to get you, it's mainly the chavs.
6Gawd D:<
With their tiny knives.
4Tax collectors and traffic wardens are out to get us.
03No they aren't :o
031. Traffic doesn't apply if you're a pedestrian :
03*:P
4I get taxed something but can't do the maths
03that's because it's the UK
/me runs
4£200 a month out of £1,300
4something like that
03Like, had I been bothered I coulda gottn like half my money back from the VAT if i wanted to
12pff yeh same
03when I went there
03and yet the Democrats say we should raise taxes, PSSSH
/me run2s
03*runs
03but seriously, like
12Tax is NOTHING in America
03My flat rate this summer was $425 a week, and I think I actually made about $375 a week
12You ought to live here
4or normal people for that matter
03That's like... not bad?
03LOL RN|stooof
03I'm not saying I'm pro-Republican either, I hate all political parties
03Articuno, they claim they want to
03but they don't actually care
12Everyone claims, whatever
I agree with that. Politics sucks.
4I'm paying it for her but still.
03I should go to that, it looks interesting.
12Thats why Xai wanted to be a politician, but it isn't happening anymore.
03heh
03I've had a few people say I'd make a good world ruler
/me hides
10meh, i'll do it tomorrow
03The key is to realize that the majority of "your" country is complete morons ^_^
/me runs
03LOL, yeah
No referendum - fail.
03I'm all for not having as many fricking laws
03Same with rules on chatrooms, etc.
03I'd say common sense should be the main rule
03and like, "take the admins seriously"
4I can't mention it here.
03Like, America is stupid like that
12But then again, it IS America
12If you don't go to war, you're doing nothing lol
03You buy a movie, you're not allowed to rip it, you can't copy it, you can't do ANYTHING
03And you're technically only supposed to play it on "licensed" DVD players
03and that's only ONE THING
03The list goes on and on
03like, why can't they just mind their own busienss?
You can rip it here.
03*business
03LOL
12Lol unlike in America, our laws are usually judged on common sense
As long as you don't distribute it.
03like about cops not being able to have guns? That's not common sense.
03Whoops?
12So even though there's a law for it, we generally look at everything individually....
03I generally just follow the laws I feel like :P
03I mean, I don't do anything STUPID
03Like go around drunk in public
03or drunk at all;
12Actually police or ANYONE rarely get shot here!
lol
03LOL
4that's even worse
03LMAO
12Because guns arent allowed
03Piracy isn't allowed
12and yes some police DO have guns
03does anyone acutally follow it?
03That's key
03and you have to realize that
12DUH
12No, it works here
03LOL
12People don't use guns
03But not in America, LOL
12Whereas in America.. you know
03Yeah
4Yes they do, on foooood
12But guns are allowed there
12Thats the point
03they're legal, but...
by
03LOL
03well I think they should make handguns illegal
03I mean, as in not sell them
4is it illegal to carry knives home if you just bought them for meat etc
03shotguns and rifles are fune
03*fine
4LOL
03as you can atcually legitimately use those to hunt
12Shot guns and rifles are only given here to people with lisensces
03but wtf are you gonna do with a handgun or assault rifle besides kill people?
03Same...
03but it's not exactly hard to get a gun license
4Arti - those people are normal psychos themselves though...
03I could go get one right now if I wanted
03I mean
12yeh
4normally*
03if you have a gun license here
03you can buy, like, an AK-47
03WHY!?
12well just look at Tier LOL he's obsessed with guns
/me runs
03WTF are you gonna do with one
12XD
4Tier wants them for zombies though
03well, see
4which is something in itself
03What I think makes sense
4Hi Gullie
12It does and it actually works in the UK
03People should be able to do whatever the heck they want in the privacy of their own home
12Um, like kill people?
03No
03but I mean
12Can I kill you in my home? LOOOOOOL
03No.
03I mean, things like drugs and w/
03e
The common sense rule applies to that.
03not that I'm in favor of them
03but people are still gonna do it
I go by natural selection.
03Articuno, that's when you catch them.
12Then it shouldnt be made legal.
03they should have the same for piracy
12So that you CAN catch them
03You should be able to watc h whatever you want at home
03just if you start giving out copies, then that's different
4brb
03but that's precisely why I'll ever get caught, or like anyone else :P
03because I don't advertise it
03besides like... on IRC
/me runs
12I am highly against drugs and don't actually see any of it as sensible
03I am too
03but you have to realize that people are still gonna do it
03and it's more fun to point and laugh
12Yes
/me runs
12lol
4Hmm Arti...just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's dangerous.
o_o
03but like
12But they are
03look at how much prohibition failed
03people still drank anyway
03worse than before, even
4Hmm I'm not even going to argue against that one.
12I thought people got taught this in schools :/
12Ok
03LOL
4They get brainwashed about it.
well we get taught
03Who pays attention in school?
/me hides
as for if anyone cares...
Yes lol
03Yeah seriously
03Like
03they "taught" us about copyrights
4I got brainwashed that sex would kill you
03I chose to completely ignore it
4My point is
12prince-dari, because no one would have it if alcahol was banned obviousl
12Ok, my school was actually realistic
03LOL, alcohol WAS banned
i don't listen to any of it anyway :(
03and look how much it failed
4Mine wasn't
03I like the laws now regarding that though
4Hmm ok
03it's illegal to be drunk in public
03or carry open alcohol
12It is here too but no one follows up on that law :/
03you can do w/e you want at a bar, but if you leave, good luck getting away
03LOL
those laws are silly
12I can tell you it is, because I've experienced it, not myself of course
12But people close to me
4Ah right well not to everyone it isn't.
03Heh
03BBL!
k bye
12No I mean the public would outrage
Oh right.
4But ok.
12I lived in a druggie estate when I was younger.
My point is, why do you think that alcahol is fine, when it kills sooooo many more people than any drug?
12I don't.
12I HATE alcohol
12But I don't want to start on that
4Me too but...once or twice is fine.
4>.<;
to get high, lol
12It's like, wtf
4I'm not promoting drugs...it's just...why legal in one country and illegal in another?
i mean, things like smoking cigarettes... lol
They're for weeding out idiots of the world.
there isn't any point to those, it doesn't make you feel any different then before you smoked
12Yes there are
4-_-
12What, ciggarettes?
yes
12The nicotine in it relaxes you
12It is a stress reliever
@Kipikipo - Unfortunately drug-users are not eligible for a Darwin award.
12That is why people smoke.
4I'm not talking about drug dealer type drugs.
12Meh I guess
12Nor am I RN
most people i know smoke because they think it's cool etc
4Well...give people a break at least?
12I am talking about cannibis, the one people take as a social thing nowadays
12Meh sorry, I hate drugs probably as much as you hate hunting
12Well not all of it
12For food, yes
it makes you smell like a bum lol
4Yeah for food hunting is fine.
^ this
12Yeh they do but I still think it should stay illegal here
4Hmmm
12Otherwise you could say people have a right to decide whether to kill other people or not lol
12Yes that as well Arrow, I support that if it's humane
Two different things.
imo, sport hunting is okay but whe/
*w/e
12Especially if other wildlife is at risk
Doing drugs is deciding something for yourself.
Killing someone else if making a decision for someone else.
I mean, I don't support drugs
12Doing drugs has an effect on loads of people :/
10http://feather7.deviantart.com/art/Polo-143286368
12sweet pic featehr
12It's not brain washing
4I didn't by the way.
destined for college, etc
4Just an example.
Banning them is a waste of money, if you are stupid enough to die, because you've taken drugs, I don't think that they should be stopped to be honest.
4Or having a quiet drink on their own at home with no one else in is bad?
@RN - Second hand smoke is actually deadlier than smoking yourself. I remember reading that before.
12RN, cannibis can make people do stupid things including hurting other people.
10thanks o:
that's why I think it should be legalized lol
4Arrow...it's in designated areas.
4Articuno it does that to some people yes but not all.
12But thats why it's dangerous.
12You can't tell.
4But people decide for themselves
Cannibis is relaxing, and a pain releaver.
12and in the process they could cause other people problems
12But thats why it's stupid that people do it in public,.
4Not that I smoked
4I can't smoke anyway
4Arti, it's a different culture in the netherlands...it's anything goes
4I'm not into smoking drugs...I didn't mean that.
12People have had asthma attacks due to horrible people smoking in their presense
4and not leave the house or harm others
12Yeh but people do.
12Thats the problem
4Sensible people don't...who just want to relax.
12It's not fair.
4in their own home
12Yes but we're talking about in public here
4I'm talking about people like me...if I decided I just wanted a quiet drink at home, not going online, being old enough, not going out, no one in the house, not having a bad mood...that would be fine yes?
They are eventually going to restrict it further, and further.
12prince-dari, it's already illegal
4I wasn't meaning in public either...and in Amsterdam there is only specific cafes where you can do that and people know beforehand what's in there.
10lol
12That sort of thing, I've seen it happen.
4I disagree with that, yes Arti, but I've never seen that.
Just because you're high, doesn't mean you're going to hit someone.
You are more likely to do that if drunk.
12I know
Because peopel get drunk then go home drunk and hit people on the way?
12and I hate people getting drunk, the problem is.. you can have a drink without getting drunk but a lot of people get high on very little cannibis
Drink Sprite? XP
12College frikkin students are too young to be boozing anyway
4What would chavs do on their stag nights? lol
4Yeah but howcome you can go to war at 16 but can't drink til 18?
4Not that I mind
12Because you don't just go straight to war
It's more likely to make you lazy, and lethargic.
4Oh I know that it was just an example
12I'm saying people DO actually do stupid things when they get high
4It just makes you giggle/sleep in fairness...
12Which is why it's stupid
4so I agree it should stay banned HERE

12Yes which is why it's stupid.. again
12Drugs are just becoming far too normal.
But that's their body.
4they can't be bothered, like how drinking is legal in teen age in Spain and no one binge drinks
12But unfortunately I did, see how frikkin out of order that is?
4except the English
4I've never heard drugs referred to as 'cool'.
Heard it all the time here.
12yeh same.
I was offered a cigarette claiming it's "good for you".
4I have never had these experiences with people with drugs, sorry.
Which further proves how uneducated the public really is about these things.
4Oh, I didn't know that.
12and yes I mean cannbis
They did at my sister's school.
4The teachers sell it to them
4lol
12Because it's becoming an acceptable thing now
On the field, in front of teachers.
4What about then...
12Society is just getting more and more relaxed on the dumbest things
4I think the word is tolerant
4but tolerance should be only about good things
12lol
This doesn't stop society running me through three criminal records checks and a medical records screening.
Hence the problem.
Why not?
Because some people do it because it's illegal.
Alcohol needs a minimum price.
4Actually people ignore things and no longer consider them cool if they are legal
They like being a 'rebel', a 'lawbreaker', they thinks it's cool.
4it's reverse psychology
You'd be surprised.
4In Spain you don't get the local teenagers binge drinking because it's legal to drink from an earlier age
12More people nowadays don't even know they're illegal, now thats pathetic
07Hi all
4they don't consider it 'cool'
4A lot of things are illegal just for the sake of it though like piracy
07Hm drug discussion?
Not because it's cool, I doubt.
Till they found out it caused a lot of problems in the body, and yet millions of people still smoke.
4In my school, you wanted to kill yourself if you smoked
And yes, it was because they thought it was cool.
4it was that simple
07RN|stooof - well piracy is distributing services without payment
07that someone was paid to create
07so I can kinda see that having a reason
07But imo they're overfloofing on THAT...
The ciggarette adverts used to be a man wearing a leather jacket, standing in relaxed pose, smoking.
Tell me that is not being marketed as "cool".
Millions of people still smoke because they're hooked on it, not because they don't know.
Used to be.
Ack, all this talk about drugs >.<
12*:/
12THAT is why it should NOT be made legal
12Sorry silvertalonarticuno
12I know it's an awful subject
It's an awful thing when unmoderated. As is everything.
It would be easier to moderate if legal.
It wouldn't be underground production, and sale.
That's like Arti going, "No rules on IRC".
There's nothing LEFT to moderate
You wouldn't end up with camel crap holding the blocks of drugs together.
4lololol
Again, two different things.
07Okies back
In the above scenario Arti may as well be an ordinary member
4It's because of the bad people that people get tarred with the same brush I guess.
If you abolish all laws, then people can do whatever they want.
12Subject change though..
If all laws were abolished, I swear, the first thing I'd do is kill everything and everyone else.
4FISH
If you stop the sale of something being illegal, it's production, and marketing would no longer be hidden.
You can monitor it.
Mainly 'cause otherwise I would be killed first
4Oh Arti...have you hard that song that says 'big fish little fish'
4heard*
Because the people producing it no longer have a need to hide it.
4I heard it in Hollywood Bowl
4yeah that one
07LOL Arrow
07What is the societys name with no laws?
12OMG is it really in hollywood bowl1?
07I know it has a name..
12I'll need to select the song some time HAHA
Anarchy.
07Ah
12Right listen to this guys

4Arti it's on the machine in hollywood bowl!
12Er, seconds even Ovo
1216 seconds
07LOL!
12ITS HORRIBLE
4If we lose tolerance then we lose ourselves...random quote
07RN|stooof tolerance is always needed
07If you make one illegal product legal, then others might demand other things too
07and we'll have it going
07o.O
4Can anyone tell me how to hide a themed map that I don't want my mum finding out about haha! or should I just tell her it was only a laugh. It's NOT about drugs or BOOZE
07Anyway brb looking at arti's link
4I'm gonna put it in the bin at work
Frickin' KEFKA.
We've made things legal in the past.
4Like people burning
They didn't end up having to make more things legal.
07prince-dari - siome people might still demand it
07LOL Yeah I can see why arti
It has never happened in the past.
07here in Norway when some people get a suggestion through
07So one thing - people want more ...
07I think some of the same might end up happening
07Lol
4What if we said 'higher taxes please!'
4then they would!
07Well it's not just about the UK =)
07LOL!!
12Tony Blair did at the start

that board is only an experimental board
why? o.o
it looks ugly D:
02Just bugs me
Too plain D:
forum markers are supposed to be like thaty
shouldn't be too flashy
also we should make our OWN theme
it's supposed to XD
eh
xD
hm
02USE IT

but that's a different size
/me goes into his hole
I'm thinking of setting up a Joomla CMS with phpBB

WAT
WE'RE HAVING A PHPBB FORUM?
why not?
...
:D
........
/me hides
....D:
I hate phpBB D:
can't we just use SMF?
SMF is meh
cause
I don't want it to be a TST copy
I know
but seriously though
Not really, they are close to the same
02Told you!
yeah totally
More themes for pbpBB too

WHY phpBB?
can't we use like
Cause
it's not SMF

IPB etc.
it is not D:
Do you have $200 to buy it?
/me thinks
no
well yes actually

12ironically enough i was just about to check my messages
6I'm only here now because I'm doing homework online and I'm just not in the mood to be without company
I wished I could give you any additional support
6I know
6thanks, but this is just one of those things that I have to do
6not necessarily run away
6just....go to a friend's and not come home for two nights...
if you want to take some time off, you're welcome to get over here :)
6oh yeah, that'll help
6dari, a conflicting issue I've decided on and my parents don't agree with
Oh.
6yeah
/me limps in pain x.x
6whats wrong?
6ugh
03Yeah
6that stinks
03:O
03Microsoft is giving a speech at my school tonight?
I had such a pain too several times before drf
seems like you had a cramp when you slept. That's the pain you're feeling now
03hm
03how long does it last? x.x
03oh
understandable
6I woke up with a bad cramp and I thought I had appendicitis >_<
6but like, I couldn't move for half an hour
6and then it went away
6it was weird
03appendicitis?
6neither would I
hey
03heh
6but it was in the right location of the body
6I sprained my wrist really badly in PE, but it never healed up properly
03LOL
03it hurt too much to not keep it still
03I was like OW THAT HURTS YOU IDIOT
6drf, I couldn't move it
03and you didn't do anything about it?
6I didn't go to the hospital though
6nope
03LOL way to got
03-t
6I hate hospitals
how are you \?
03why?
03I only hated having to wait like 5 hours before they'd see me x.x
6I'm very uncomfortable in them
6dunno why
03since I wasn't dying they just kinda ignored me
03but that's Beaumont for you
6fear of shots, fear of just being in there
03o.o
03Shots are nothing LOL
6for me they are
/me runs
03heh
03it's like how some people are irrationally scared of dentists >_>
03Generally if they're there to help I'm not scared...
6prodded
03Heh
03I spent a fricking hour yesterday "Fixing" a PowerPOint that someone in my chemistry group made
03and now looks like I gotta do it again >_>
12get openoffice drf
12or is open source above you?
12:P
03I have it
03OOo fails too
03Office 2007 is just plain retarted
03*retarded
03like
12abiword?
03if you open it in there
03all the graphs are messed up
03...PowerPoint, not Word
03documents always work fine LOL
12oh
12abipowerpoint? 8D
6PPTX is just aplain fail
03wtf?
03Yeah
03well the thing is
03they saved it as PPT
03but it has these graphs from Excel
6oh
03unlike in earlier versions where it just copied the f'ing graph
03it made it as a link
6ew
03and you can't do it properly without having the XLS file too
03Yeah
03so my only fix was to copy it into Paint and copy it back as a picture >_>
6 2003 was such a nice program
03Yeah I knoiw
6why "fix" it
03*know
03I've got 2000, 2007, and 2010 on here
032000 still owns all of them LOL
I can just copy-paste graphs into powerpoint. O_o
6dunno if I've used 2000
From excel.
And I have 2007.
It works fine for me. :o
03prince-dari, alright, but have you tried saving as .PPT and opening it in an earlier version?
03It'll whine at you saying you can't do it
Why isn't it saved as a .pptx?
03EW PPTX
Lol.
03ït's like PPT on steroids
Because that's powerpoint 2007 version extension.
03I made the f'ing thing myself, kthx
6._.
03there's really no advantage to PPTX
03Like that shadow-text crap
03it's the same as WordArt
03they just chose to make it incompatible
03because they're stupid./
03prince-dari, precisely my point of how much it FAILS
Hm.
Ok, fail.
BRB, gunna get something to eat.
03and ugh formatting
03"Click here to add title"
03Real pros just do it themselves ><

6but apparently they made one for GS, RSE, and the RBY remakes
03yeah, I had a lame attempt at making a full length clean version
03since the normal one fades out way early
Hiya TimeShift
How are ya?
well...that was five hours ago. I'm finally done with it...and Magix is transcoding the movie files right now
03o.o magix?
03ew all in one converters
as long as it works, I'm fine with it
I thought about it llots!
03I do all my encoding by hand LOL
:D
I'm gonna chill out and eat now, might pop on later
03an TMPGEnc FTW
kk cya Arti!
03Yes.
03DS download station
6is it wifi in the building, or do you-
6oh
03Yeah
128D
03Better quality? :P
6awesome
you need to learn A LOT about time and money efficiency
03who said anything about money? LOL
I'm an IT specialist and soon I'll be a service manager for a whole service center - each extra hour I need to work costs me around 120 euros. As long as the product is not worth the additional work, I don't do it
03That's why encoding in the background FTW?
03I wake up and it's done
03problem solved
03oh, well I use Corel for that
03I thought you mean you ewre using a one-click converter
03Yes?
03Corel VideoStudio
03best thing ever
03Yeah, why?
/me facepalms
6pfth
6*shows
03LOL
03Because it's top-secret >:O
03Nah, I dunno
6lol
well, yeah, I know there're also hackers just taking ECHO for programming...
6well, I have to make that drive anways, but I still hope it's there
03Heh
03I gotta take a bus
03and it's like a 53 minute ride with transfers >_>
why take a bus?
6I gotta drive >:O
just walk
03that takes LONGER
6it's a 40 minute drive
03LOL, driving ftw
03I'd be fine with that
03I mean, buses ftw too
6eh
03I don't have a bike here
Oh.
6I'm bringing my music, because our radios are here are notorious for going on commercial AT THE SAME TIME
03LOL
6or playing cruddy songs at the same time
TV programs do that.
03Zune + Casette adapter + my mom's van's tape deck = WIN
All go to adverts at the same time.
03also, being dangerous by changing the song while you're driving FTW?
6I'm not kidding, there was this time where 4 of my stations played one of my LEAST favorite songs within 10 seconds of each other...so I just turned the radio off
6LOLyes
6hmm
6I should probably get ready to go now I guess
6the heck? "water found on moon"
eh?
6http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/science/14moon.html?_r=1&hp&emc=na
I'm guessing it means 'ice'
03yeah, someone left the hose on
/me runs
The Ipod touch has to be the only good thing apple has ever made.
I wanna get over 9000 plushies!
/me brick'd
03EW IPODS
03-?
Why is that?
Justify yourself. :P
03because it's not an iPod?
/me hides
03but really
03It has a radio, first of all
03AND HD Radio
03better screen resolution
03it can play HD, as the name says, with a dock
I'm fairly sure "There's an app for that"
03Plus those apps requrie Wi-Fi
03*require
03LOl
03Just drive backwards on the one way streets, problem solved :)
6LOL
well, if he had trusted the program, he would have needed four weeks...
I don't listen to the radio much anyway.
...because the program implanted around 2100 U-turns into the route^^
03Heh
6it would have had you drive through the atlantic
Anyway, if you do have an Ipod touch, you get to scam apple out of their overpriced, and pointless applictions. :)
03yeah whatever, I think apps are stupid
03I mean, 99% of them
03Games, fine
03but the "Fart button" app, completely pointless
6lol
03Zune HD has games, wtf else would you need?
:P
How much memory does it have?
03well it's America only, sadly
03there's a 16GB and 32GB
Ahh, cool.
urgh^^
03DANG IT C++
Nice.
03That OVERWROTE the text
go ahead with C# drf ;)
03...
03I can't just change it >_>
Can't you specify a line for it to output onto, but have it as a variable, that increases each time it's run, or something.
03Not really
03I mean, ordinarily yes, but the program we have to write is harder than that
03whatever, I'll get ready to go to Toys R Us now LOL
6same
6by everyone, be back in a few hours
6bye
6fdoigd
bye you
12hmm
I dunno. XD
I've changed the priority to real-time
Hm.
O_o
I have no idea.
that's the highest priority you can set
03depends how old they are
well, high seems to work for me right now
03that's my point LOL
eh?
When there's nothing left to cough up.
03XD
12good answer
Lol.
XD
03Um
03Basically, ASCII maps.
Oh right.
Does each output have to be in the same text file?
03Yes ;/
03and each newer one has to go on top
03which is the problem
03otherwisre I'd just keep outputting and it would go on bottom
Hm.
03anyway, i gotta make a bus

I'm going through my datasheet collection... just found the wireing instructions for one of the old 5MB reel-to-reel tape drives.
Wow.
Bah... actually it isn't quite that old.
It only goes as far back as the early 80s. IBM was already on cartidges by then.
And wireing instructions for the Euromod system, whatever that is.

This datasheet section it titled 'hardened nipples.' :>

Oh, they look really cute, and some of them are friendly...

You just broke the rule! D: :P
But they have been known to be very violent at times.
I also broke rule #2 D:
6dolphins are territorial
Lol.
Very.
O_o
12sounds promising
4Giggity?
^ Lol
6lol
No ._.
but they are known to protect humans from sharks though. sharks seem to be afraid of them
6mindset
They are also over-sexed, and have been observed killing other dolphins - often killing the offspring of a female in order to free her up for mateing w ith.
me too
Even killing dolphins of other species, even though there is no competition for food... they just do it *because it's fun*.
Well yeah :P

4and I cracked up
For half the book
07o3o
12hi
I think when writing the book, she must have been limited to a vocabulary of about 50 words.
6kyu, dunno
6I thought it was 4
6I think
6pretty sure
07but it's probably 2
/me runs
6loooooooooool
Nah, Stephenie Meyer rapes the thesaurus
Chagrin
LOL
There's another book she wrote, that's apparently really good o.o I can't remember the name, but my friend told me about it
"verbose"
02That's right, it's Saturday over there
How many times did she repeat granite and smoldering?
6oh right
4I know JK has some repetitive things
6I gotta hide the JIF in my room
"broodingly"
4but unlike Twilight, Pothead is good
07lolwhy
07XD
6my family doesn't buy JIF
04lol
Words like that that no one ever uses and don't even make sense in the context she uses them in
04It's Saturday here as well
4yeah
04Oh

I fear neither are they able nor would they be allowed to deliver that information to a random person on the net drf :P
03LOL
03I should go download it again, and leave it running
02Hiya Slash
hi!
at least you're able to
I wished I could in fact
Well, I would draw Luane for you, TimeShift. But I'm afraid of screwing up the anatomy. =v= I can never get the wings, feet, or fins drawn right.
04^I am the same
04>.<;
02Well, I can't draw at all
that's because I used a simple mechanical model
04Shiny >.>
02What?
well, I used a very simple mechanic for reference. Yet I have problems with every other perspective then plainly looking at it from the side or front
04I draw for amusement
12I want to make an ID of my Articuno/Ninetales Hybrid.
12NINENINE :D
04You couldn't call it drawing
04ovo
One thing that I find odd is when Lugia's wings are drawn with only 4 "fingers" O.o It's supposed to have five on each wing if I'm not mistaken.
024 plus "thumb"
correct
the thumb is below - as the wing's in fact a real hand

10We have too many clubs to be honest
03just a bad one :P
02We have 3 and they're all School "funded"
10Lol, funded, why?
Well...
10Ours are free to join
10except if you want to join a school athletic team
10then you'd have to pay for unirforms, etc
03exactly, because R4 sucks :P

/me noms the garlic bread!
10Whut.
/me shrugs
03> Dracula was OK, but WTF @ Twilight
03> How can people even compare it to Harry Potter >_>
03because they're stupid...
10Yep
03LOL
02Just like any movie star

10Gah
10Altair isn't around
10Twilight was over rated from the very beginning
03duh
Twilight shouldn't have been successful as it was.
10the die-hard fans around my school gave up
twilight the movie was very... boring
If it didn't have the fanbase of the book
It would've fell flat on it's face
03If people read it and thought it was a good book, whatever, I'd still disagree but not hate them nearly as much
10Lol fangirls
/me screams "JACOB BLACK!!"
03Fangirls are far worse than fanboys5 :P
10.-.
03-5
10Durr
/me crawls into his Anti-Twilight hole
/me runs
And he absolutely hates twilight, despite being a main character
10Who?
/me hugs
02Hey
/me hugs back
03And then he'd sell them bootleg copies... which is like, not only a bad thing to do, but it's also a bad movie
/me jumps in Shiny's hole too
10Robert Pattinson
Yes, him
Was hilarious
10Heh
10if only Taylor Lautner had more fans
:2
:3
I'm not trying to bash twilight, I read the books before the whole fad and didn't mind them
10Books > Movies for sure
/me runs
02Unless it's fan-animations
02Because then the directors actually read the books :3
03though audiobooks are awesome, that's where it's all at XD
10At least Stephenie Meyer didn't overdo the Twilight book series
Everyone else did, though
10Yeh
10They made some television series called Vampire-something
03and then that one movie that came out recently...
02Vampire Diaries
02Oh, now you pay attention to me >.>
10movie*
Billions of rip off books
/me thinks
it's more vampires than werewolves
02Kk
and the only recent werewolves book series I'm aware of is actually good
They're remaking Blood and Chocolate
Which looks horrid
10Ah, it was "The Vampire's Assistant"
07ahoyhoy

02Hey Kipi
7couldn't be bothered.
7I got to level two.
Wow.
Too hard? XD
7No. Too boring.
Admit it.
It's too hard after level two for you.
I did admit it.
But I bet you can't do it.
You're attention span is shorter than 2 minutes?
mine is occasionally
Wow.
7It's amazing how long two minutes can seem when all you're doing is moving the mouse around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and
/me yawns
But the point is, I don't think you could get past level 3.
14ADD Ftw?
Trust me, it's the most boring thing ever.
Anyway, I can't even get past level 3. :/
I give you 30 seconds into the first level to give up, Ryft.

thanks for letting em print screen guys :)
04Bah

7unless you start throwing knives at my house, I highly doubt I'll put it on there.
7because it would require actually doing something.
6googlemaps on blackberry phones ftw
7and if we were going to do it, we'd never /tell/ you.
7with that thought, I bid my goodbye.
for all I know you could still have done it, you're just denying it

and hi MooreHorn
it's fun how in all games you kill one enemy and three pop out of nowhere
AAAAAAAA. I just tried the NaNoWriMo word counter, it says 19 901 words when OpenOffice says 20 018 D:
I haaate that! Unless they're easy to kill
Then it's fun button mashing hack and slash
openoffice includes numbers, -'s, etc.
maybe nanowrimo ignores those
Probably... 100 words is nothing, but it is annoying when I stayed up all night to reach 20 000 when in reality I didn't :/
04Heya all
Heya Rocket_Ninetales!
woo kill one enemy 7-8 pop out of nowhere
/me lets his drones eat them

they're not really eating them but it's amusing to say that they are when they fly around and kill the enemies in like 3 seconds
07Yeah?
Lady GaGa looks like Jenova

02Huh?
2D:< You shouldn't throw Creatures of Light
04Why does Ho-oh have to have such large wings? x.x
There are some that fly without wings.
6excluding those
6psychic powers don't count
6true that
6which is why I said "technically"
6doesn't mean they dont
unless they just ignore the fact that things tend to keep the same density
/me points to Saphire and flees
6for the amount spat out and that duration of time, it could easily have filled up a high shcool swimming pool
I've also wondered how many squirtles you'd have to strap to a vehicle before it could fly, using their jets like engines.
lol
Those being the lightest ones I know of that can do a hydro pump.

2How 'bout Buizel's... uh... ability
2forgot them anme

2Swift Stream
02I know
02What about it?
2o3o
2its sort of like Sand Stream
6how? buizel doesn't make it rain
6that's drizzle
2o3o
2oh
2I realized something yesterday
Meowth has a move that summons money from nowhere, too. The one in the anime being an exception.
2*yesterday
6also
2in my dreams... the laws of physics all apply
2and magic exists
2but then...
2Common sense is non-existant

Inhale to go up, exhale to go down.

That's how divers do fine boyancy control.
02My dream last night was me being a Sandshrew and serving Dialga Ovo'

6I JUST found it
but this comment here is just lol:
lolwut
6lolyeah
2o3o
6you can't say its her character, as it's EXACTLY like XD001
13i dunno
2o3o
10k
10oh wow
2thanks, Horo
it's not exactly LIKE XD001, this IS XD001
10Light Latios is on TST forums
2but I'm suposed to find a reliable site
10it must have snuck on or something
10)*
6I'd say that, but the name is different :P
a reliable estimate doesn't exist, and it all depends on just how much you do to help with this
7Sardoodledom. O_o
2Time
2its...
2its a club
for instance, irrigating Africa. That much land would produce a HUGE amount of food, plenty for a population many times bigger than current
6but XD001 is a name
2uh...
2Horo
2sorta
that's why I said depending on how much effort you put in to maximising the capacity
or do you think dumbness should be divided through the members within the club?
6loooool
2-_- can you just let me finish
2NO, dumbness does not get divided
it'd cost billions, minimum, but the population supported by it would be massive
2however
6you're supposed to be at the mall :P
07well I was putting my bike pump back lol
07turns out there's an actual hole in the tire, not just a flat D=

6true
6I kinda want to comment telling them to put credit to me, not just TST, for those linearts
6but I dun wanna get involved
2o3o
6o3o
2I don't think that's a good idea, Time
three now in fact
2I still don't think its a good idea
2well...
2may I point out that millions of people around the world don't give credit, and counting, as well?
2therefore, if you just sue one, that's not going to really solve the problem
6I'm gonna comment
2and also, let's take an example
6because I can
2sure
2oh
2sure
2*sigh*

12Hello ^v^
hey there
12hello TS
12hello rekless
I just decided not going to sleep til in about 19 hours
12Ovo
12what time is it there?
01:39 atm
12AM!!
12oh
I still don't understand why some still use clocks with "am" and "pm" in it
I do
instead just continue conting til 23:59
12well, its about 4:40 pm here
/me runs
12XD
it is 18:41 here :D
7It's shorter, TS?
or...it's 16:41. xP
12thats military time
yeah, 11:59 pm is MUCH shorter than 23:59, right
No
12yes
7I meant when you talk about day and night.
But 4:41 pm is shorter than 16:41
:D
12lol
you fail again :)
12me?
7LOL, that person on dA just hid all of those comments.
LOL
4:41 pm is exactly ONE character longer than 16:41
14I SHALL CLEAR IT UP
14Some of us buy clocks with P.M. and A.M. because those are the only clocks we can find
14>:O
12exactly
I thought it was because those circle clocks would look weird if they had 24 hours on them.
hi Shara
12hello ^v^
hi Shara
hi
14And anyway, my computer clock doesn't say 18:44 right now

/me 6chuckles and then laughs, "Hey!" X3
12so, in about 5,000,000,000
/me 10stops and puts him down
scientific fact: the earth rotation speeds up by 0.002% during fall and winter and slows down again during spring and summer
14Scientific fact: I don't care.
14Just kidding
does it matter what's gonna happen in 5,000,000,000 years?
12thats because the orbit is elliptical
12well, no
no, that's because the leaves are falling off most of the trees during fall
12lol
14But it's still fun to know XD
XD
12yes
12yes it is
/me 10lays down again
14Do leaves really make that much of a difference?
14They're still on Earth, they fall to the ground
12I alredy know that
oh yes, they do
10i only have 25 mins

hello
14Hey.
I see.

I seee.
okay. thanks
o_o ok.....
I'm in the mood for Castlevania now
buh bye, people
later
12hmm
lol
...
?
i've had times when the pointer on the wii version stopped working as well ......
xD*
12o-o
arghhh this statement is overly complex..
12hi
12:)
bye everyone
7true.
hey there
blerghhh..... anyone want to look over a bit of script for me? >.>
invincibilty would've been VERY helpful in TEN
7Yeah
7I fucking hated TEN
7never finished it
hi TimeShift
7I need to hook up my bro's old PS2 and finish it.
7and piss around in spider man2
I'll do it, though it's possible I won't know proper formatting
eh. if I put 'end' within 'while', does it just end the 'while' or the entire script?
hate those freaking dogs >_>
I'd think it'd end the whole script. Usually while, if there is a closing statement, uses something different like wend
depends on the language
ergh.
where should I post it?
the forum I guess?
um, ok. one sec.
computer and website help is the right subforum, right?
yeah. but wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
also, is there a 'code' tag on this forum or something?
/me lets someone else answer, as he doesn't use forum much
TimeShift?
present
just give it a try - I haven't tried it yet
but I'm quite sure SMF is capable to
use preview if you don't want to risk embarrasing yourself
I know.
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4464.0 posted.
have you got enough }'s, to start with
also, that many blocks makes for REAALLY ugly code
my checker said the syntax was correct.
decreases it by 1
and it's usually 'and' '&&' or '&', from my experience
would be the same as xtext = xtest-1
hm. could try it later
supposed to end the script
as in, all of it
checks to see if the point given is free (no collissions)
hrm
okay
tidiness note: since you already checked for < 64, if (xtest > 64) == 0 could be an else instead
I tried doing that, but my checker wouldn't let me use else D:
wouldn't let you?
o.O
well. it said it was wrong
also, I'm certain you're missing two }'s, unless you just didn't copy them
GML.
12tired
have you tried just running with two extra }'s anyway?
'w'
I can try. one sec
odd.
that made it work >.>
I've taken quite a few out and now the if (lr) == 1 and following while loops don't close
:P
whatever
don't always trust syntax checkers
sure, NOW it says they're correct...
did you make any changes since that?
no.
yes. that happens sometimes with this program.
always remember, if it says it's wrong, but by the most basic knowledge of the language it's right, then the checker is wrong
mmkay.
damnit
Do you have the SSL port open?
Because I want to attempt a SSH tunnel
Hey.
I don't have it open.
I'm not 100% sure I can support SSL.
Well, think I'll be able to still get in?
Not sure.

/me 7just changed the word ''intelligence' in her fic to 'intellectualness'
6I wasn't planning a full room cleaning until january when I have no school

5i gtg
5byez
bye Kira
7But it's similar as they both relate to one's mind and stuffs, right?
6yeah but, it doesn't "sound" like intelligent speak
02Sure, we'll go with that
7Ah, fine. *changes it to something else*
6adding -ness to words can be a very touchy subject, as sometimes it makes the writer sound a bit...young?
6young's not the right word
7Intellect, Intelligence, Intellectualness. O_o

still sad, post holiday blues and all
went to all our fav places
grrr
I dont LIKE my habitat you know!
id much rather be in tropical weather
And yet you call yourself an ice burd
but I'm doomed to be in the North where I freeze...
that's because I. manipulate ice, doesn't mean I like the feel of it
No no no, you're supposed to be the avatar of ice itself!!
ommmmmmgggggg
not me
Well, that reminds me, do you remember that commission scenario I shown you?
I don't intend to ever leave my habitat though
which?
Hm...
Been to DA lately?

03hm
03what's good is Micro Center

03Where do you live?

03o.o

6In the first RP we played, my friend sets in a world where Cynder already took over the world of the dragons. It was a very changing event, yet she let us live, if we (Hooktail and I) joined with her minions. After that was made, everything is different. The mansion may be still there, but let's just say it's very unusual.
/me 14gives off a sigh of relief as he sees a setting with more atmosphere.
12i wouldn't mind having that planeswalker as well

Hello everybody !

Bye then.
/me yawn
12jerry alert
1310Alert fail *shot*
12he's tricking you D:
12he's secretly lurking
10Meep
10:|
1310meow
1310Aw D:. Why?
1310Unless you don't want to talk about it ofc
10Andyman always ALWAYS tries to think of a way to get me mad
10The past few threads he's mentioned my name, saying I did something wrong
10I'm really going towards telling a mod/admin now, just to get him off my tail
10D:<
10Also, if you scroll down on this thread: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=2944.15
1310should be like online services, blist/block = they practically doesn't exist to you anymore
10Andyman came after and basically tried to act like he awas a mod
10LOL
10was**
1310i have to say LOL WTF at that example though
1310even i would react, most likely just by quoting and saying "wat" though
1310I'll disagree there.
1310I think that would work. At least i think :P
1310also TEAL TEAL TEAL
10well, as long as he ain't in charge of anything else, I guess it's fine
10Teal wall :3
1310Yes. All of it.
10But yeh
10if I need backup, I know where to go
/me points to Xelig00n
1310lolwut
10you're my official witness
2hai guys

2SKYLANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10What do you mean, Xeli?
1310He went "jerry alert" hurr
2lol
10Oh did he?
10Ah
2XD
2Skylands ftw
/me is shot
2Xeli: no u
2heya MooreHorn
/me glomps MooreHorn
2uh..another meaning for hug?
10'Glomp' is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a hug :P
=^.^=
10not anything sexual related, though
thanks for translate =)
10:3
1310So, a glomp is pretty much a tackle-hug.
1310Whoo
10It's in the japanese Wiki page
10which also has the definition of "kawaii" and "desu" etc
1310don't link me there
2Skylands and Xelig00n ftw~
1310If that counts as +1 i start having quite a lot.
/me makes Xelig00n have the spazz mood
/me is shot
10I don't think it's possible for Xeli to be a spazztic
10tbh
10maybe if I bought him an Espeon plushie it might be different
2xD
/me pokes the silence
2!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!"

12:)
12hi food
1Hai Nick~
'lo, Nick.
/me slaps Nick around a bit with a large trout
ow D:
hi Aero and Kipi
/me nuzzles Nick
02hey Nick!
12i never said you were
hi Code :)
*** Nick joined #silverwings d4db7796@widget.mibbit.com (Widget)
12what i meant was that you are everyone else's food
12not mine
He's not my food. 83
12i don't eat humans
12too vengeful
/me steals Nick
/me stores a him in a jar.
/me somehow avoids
TRU UK still dont have that darn Lucario figure in stock :(
I wish I got it when I first found it...
I was too much of a skinflint LOL
02aww, :(
thats the third time our Slide film has been lost/destroyed in the college owned cameras
02everybody's film Nick? =(
/me offers Nick a ride around on his back
12thanks for the gift
yeah there were shots from other students as well
6BLAH

/me remembers when him and Xelig00n would debate
1310I remember that as well.
1310Now as you said it xD
12yes or no
6hmm
6depends on how you look at it
Heya nick ;>
6it does as that substance
6then no
6it does not ;)
1310water...
6*hydrogen
6*dioxide
6because that's WRONG
6o3o
6most schools teach it to be called "hydrogen dioxide" when in fact, it's "Dihydrogen monoxide"
6yup
6I've always noticed the difference
Not chemically possible
Hydrogen only has the capability to form one bond
1310Hydrogen only have the first "shell" of electrones or something
1310 I REMEMBER learning this
I thought my photo was up in the college gallery and I was like omg they put my pic up!
Though I suppose it could be a hydrogen-oxygen-oxygen chain
><
which, I suspect, would promptly disintegrate from 2 HO2 to H2 + 2 O2
6ew
6c;ass
6*class

12I like company.
03XD
03But I've seen that in other people too
03like some of my IRL friends
03who want to do everything with their girlfriend, and act completely different when they're alone
12Yeh ever figured that maybe YOU'RE the disfunctional one?

10wot?!
/me 14looks up at Ember, looking at her for a brief moment before Looking at Cynder.
I already know I'm a malfunctioning entity. Yet the spare part to be replaced within me is to be invented I guess
(Cynder) paralyses darkshadow using fear
10WtH
and lol Arti - I seem to have simply talked this giant-lugia-selling-girl against a wall
12Eh?

10i already have a bad reputation
She: Er, i'm considering $5,000 offers and above, but still not sure x_x()
She: Heh heh, only *considering* offers over 5 grand. You'd be the third person in desire of it.
Me: well, if I was - why isn't it sold already ;)
She: I'm still not sure to sell ^_^ I might not take $5,000.
12Lol!
12Moar?
(Spyro) nods thats my cynder
10great another enemy
that's it til now
lemme see how she'll try to bend herself out of this
if she says "I might not take 5 grand" - I'm fine with paying less ;)
12XD
(Cynder) U mind if keep sparx, spyro?
maybe we should make some kind of reverse-auction
(Spyro) No i don't (Sparx) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4To RP, I mean
03sigh, stupid college kids
03Whose fricking fault is that?
I actually bothered to come on here at school for once o.o
(Cynder) kisses spyro on the cheek & says ok u guys r free to go except sparx

LOL
4It is called....

4Spyro Games! Make a topic
14That takes too slow...
lol
031. Don't go to parties and be drinking when people have cameras
03in my case, omit the last part
4if you do it right
032. If you do, own up to it
4Darkshadow: that place is easy

/me wakes up from a wet
vulcan u want to keep going?
10brb
14Sure.
underage drinking is okay under certain conditions
03is it just me or does people's roleplaying get completely inapropriate and uncalled for after a while?
/me hides
well actually i have to head to work in a hour
wut?
03and meh, I'm just completely against drinking
03You may as well just directly kill brain cells, it would get the job done quicker
03and I mean the whole wet naps, wet bunnyfoxes, etc
03it's just annoying, and wtf is the point besides sounding inapropriate?
later vulcan
14Ok. Later. :3
depends on the drink, some are quite nice
03such as, Mountain Dew
/me runs
/me loves rum
12yeh and pepsi

03but just about any other soda, I like
03Yeah
07LOL Arti
/me runs

03artificially though...
thats the way i see it
12Maybe when you're as shy as you lol
12I don't need to take drugs or anything like that to relax, I'm just too awesome
03Me too :)P

03Me too!
03Though one of my friends is like that, I'v emade fun of him a few times
03this is now the 3rd time he's gotten drunk since we moved in
o.o
/me stares at his inbox.
12What?
hmm...
There is nothing wrong with a few drinks with friends. It's just binge drinking that's bad.
12We never said there was something wrong with a few drinks.
12But people are ALL about binging now
...No they don't?
03LOL
12Ever been out on a weekend night??/

Two weeks until I may or may not have a job now :>
12How can they make you wait two weeks? Sheesh
No, they are making me wait four to six weeks.
12...
Because that's how long it takes for the CRB check to run.
12LOL
And they can't formally consider me for the job until that is complete.
12It took two and a half weeks to sort mine AND I hadn't included my documents when I sent the form first time
It's peak time of year.
I had to wait 19 months for MY job initially...
12Yes but didn't you have a job at the time??
no

03o_O
03What are you trying to make?
03that's a LOT of {}s
oh
A colour script
03also
03you can next
03*nest
and which certain channels that don't have colour
03Something like that
03for example
03on *:connect: {
03if ($network == HoSHiNET) {
03}
okay
/me changes his entire profile to "everyone"
I'm on laptop
03Er, security wise :P

02uh
02I'm on a LOT of channels
02I have 11 IRC channels open, drf
03and you need color on them? >_>
02IRC servers*
02yah
03For that matter TST is the only server I've ever seen that allows color
03generally you'll get banned

03hold oin
03*on

02k
03Ok, that worked...
03I added a second one for #Test
03Test
03Yep, works XD
03so they go in order, top to bottom.
03if you can do a !
02?
03like on input !Channel
03test
02ah
03... XD works
03wait no
03That just makes it never show blue anywhere
02hm
02I have an idea
03so do I LOL
02my script is like
02on *:INPUT:*:{
02if (/* !iswm $1) {
02if ($chan != #z) {
6stupid names
02what if I changed $chan to $network?

02okay
04Bah
03Test
04Would anyone here request a drawing from me?
04Just our of curiosity

03if ($chan !=#Test) {
03}
/me pokes his journal entry
02hm
03just leave the whole color script alone
02Well
03but theoretically you should be able to put it in a conditional
02I like colour ):
02well
03...wtf
03this doesn't work either
03if ($network == HoSHiNET) {
03}
03that works for my startup script...

Yes, but the DNa is manmade.
The DNA isn't alive by itself though
It was apparently created out of parts from different cells
huh...
i did a report on genetic engineering a year ago
It's not completely man made -- in order to make something completely artificial, you first must create the universe
there are a few ways of doing it
*preexisting
such as introducing a bacteria that injects its own dna into another organism like corn
Anyone would.
As a minimum, I mean
It doesn't qualify, I agree.

Posts: 1 <--- even made an account to argue the point of view :P
haha
Hehe
Hahaha
It's hard to argue morality, because at some fundamental level, you have to have an opinion simply based on itself and not logic
It's kind of like geometry -- there's a point where you can't define things anymore, and you just have to take it like it is
yeah, I can see how that would be
morality is fuzzy logic
:P
hahaha

03it has a watermark even in the gallery
only in imaginary units of time
03gaaaaah that resized it

03I mean
03:P
03*side
03what I want to do
He thought it was illegal
03is get a Smeargle
uber I mean]
03sketch it to learn Spore, False Swipe, Mean Look, and some other move
Like #3?
03it would be a POkémon catching machine:D
Ixr#3 was pretty uber
Yep.
03hm?
03nol
03*no
*not
03Mean Look to prevent them from escaping, Spore to put them to sleep, False Swipe to get them to 1HP
12drfsupercenter
ahh
12XD
xD
03no Pokémon other than Smeargle can legit-ly learn all 3
i didn't think of that XD
Lol
03oh
03you mean for the 4th move?
12yes
03ah
Wunder*
03yeah
03because only Smeargle can do that XD
Sliced bread: The best thing since... some other significant achievement.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ79pCJBcJ8

Lol

03oh
03hm
03can you EV train it to get its speed up?
12yes
03:P
LOL at dari's commercial
03I need to GET a Smeargle first
03but yeah
12it only have 75 base speed though drf XD
03hm
You got censored.
03since I'd only be using it to catch
Fine then
:P
03er nature
03not stats
Be that way
12i got it
12drf teach it agility instead
03um
03no
03because Mean Look has to be used on the first turn
03for the ones that run
12yes mean look
Censored. :P
12spore then setup agility XD
I think it would be benefitial though
12i dunno
12i guess a level 100 smeargle
12should be able to have enough speed
playback delete and rewind
03yeah
03I mean, I'd really just need it as a catching machine XD
yeah, one second
I have to finish talking to some people
k
12my only concern is that it has low seed XD
12*speed
03yeah well
03I'll see
03It was just an idea :P
XD
ha
12drf
12maybe heal block
03hm
yes?
ha
wheres rurik
You mean tits?
ha

I clicked the "you"
and it was a rickroll
03hm
03actually nah
haha
03none of the roaming legendaries have moves like that
12well i thought you wanted a catching machine
12not a roaming legendary catch machine
03I do
03but Mean Look is only needed for roaming oines
03*ones
12mean look for roaming
Tits?
ugh more people are going idle :(
/me is no longer idle
Yummy
...XD
The top questions are:

03um
03Technician?
03what's that do
Harsh
O.o
03hm
You gave him a name [censored]ser though
I'mma surrender now.
:D
12it'll make things a little faster
12since false swipe is only 40 base power
yes his name is dicckser
03ah
:D
03well assuming it's not roaming
but he prefers to shorten it to dxr
03I can just weaken it, then switch in Smeargle
ha
12think ahead
03then I'd just use False Swipe over and over and over XD
12not mention
12*not to mention
12you don't want to fall victim to pressure
eww
I know. Preicsely why I had to share it with you all.
Infamouz, I'm on
lol that reminds me earlier child was on edina's gmail complaining about the weather being too warm
xD When?
couple hours ago
just a sec
03hm
03so let's see
Bwha
03that seems to be the best choice, right?
12you have 2 choices
^this
12i think you have the right idea
Did you talk to her today?
yeah
12but speed is bigger priority
03right
03and I don't want to lower defense
03since False Swipe is physical, right?
03erm
03what?
12EVs XD
lol infa z
Lol good luck
:P
Lol, without warning and all?
lol
Its gonna be a blood bath
We're going to wash blood?
03oh
03well I don't do EV training
Wash in it
03really, it's just like
That's a little counterproductive.
Perhaps
say my name when a cool subject comes up thanks
03what
03double battles?
12well that
Aicy
XD
03hm
03OK
03well
03I need to catch a Smeargle first
12and they have like level 10 pachies
03what I was thinking is like
03teach it a move that can KO the enemy
Eh do the same for me
03so I can level it up
03then teach it the 3 moves
03then finally get rid of that one
IXR11!
12ok
Dirty liar
12you are going to have fun training smeargle
EXCITING [censored] IS GOING DOWN!

:P
03I wish someone could just like
12actually magikarp has more speed than smeargle as well XD
EXCITING CENSORSHIP
03that would be extremely useful XD
03but it's probably impossible to get that without it being hacked

Icechat's being dumb
Dari did it. :P

/me whistles innocently.
/me whistles guiltily.
I don't think that's it
I probably got hacked or something
Nah.
BSODs happen all the time for no apparent reason.
...
No reason?
Yeah, I've heard of a lot of people getting it for no reason
Just kidding.
I used to get them randomly immediately after pressing 3 random keys at the same time by accident.
It wasn't that. :P
But that doesn't make any sense at all
10Thanks
It wouldn't have any connection to IRC.
xD
I know
I'm not saying it did
BSoDs don't make sense, either.
I'm just saying it's a weird coincidence
Yeah you stopped talking the second I identified
that was weird
which again, I know makes no sense
Arg
300k stuffz scanned 169 infections.
wE'VE RESORTED TO PIRATESPEAK, NOW?
:P
...
Did it happen to scan for a Staph infection?
/me uses tri-dot slumber.
Or perhaps a Flood infection.
/me fail
>_<
I have that, but it never finds anything
Mine always does.
You should take meds for that.
It's considered one of the best scanners out there.
Was that the one you got after the Help Desk incident?
Yeah
haha
the search redirecting one
yeah
If you go on any computer help forum they always tell you to use Hijackthis, ComboFix, or MBAM.
Usually they tell you to scan with MBAM first.
And you had MBAM before that?
I've used both combofix and MBAM
Combofix seemed to have worked
Then if problems persist upload a Hijackthis log.
The most annoying I had was one transmitted through the router.
I killed it though. :)
xD
half that was censored
You could have simply gone into safe mode, but alright.
yeah, not me then
<.<
I find it useful for things I know I want gone.
You also need to be careful since Hijackthis has a very limitied whitelist.
/me plays a tune on his ocarina
Oh, okay. My mistake.
Yknow
*limited
I've done job applications and bought things on this computer
I think I'll get rid of this ol prop and get a real ocarina
Br
Brb

Oh, they already have them.
They were up on a site.
Didn't I tell you?
....
:P
Sorry. :P
or at least jokes of that nature
/me meausres the Line, then steps back.
*measures
Haha
yeah, sould probably go and try scanning for viruses again
<.<
It may have been nothing
I highly doubt a BSOD is nothing
need to start up my DS
<.<
it is a lot of the time

G4 made a anime series
5That's ridiculous.
well its G4
RP4L: well they did alot of that
It was a victim of the 80's cartonification process that got literally everything.
I hate X-men + Star Trek comics

Team TGWTG
5What is her /name/?
basically review the 'girl' nostalgias
Yeah, I like that
5>>
or its on her wikipedia
meh
the Care Bears wasnt strictly limited to girls
I think I'm slightly neurotic
to be honest
yeah
to an extent
Yeah, of course.
Mhm. No outlet to vent in, or you stop yourself from using one.
5I'm watching her review on Dragonheart.
That's the part that reminds me of myself
that, sparked all that openings for memes
when I get angry
I really have no outlet
but I kinda liked the movie
I think that's where self-harm comes in, unfortunately.
Yeah I know
that's why I worry about myself XD
Have you seen or read Fight Club?
Yeah.
yeah, like into a pillow
or anything like that
For me, when I get angry, I go from one distraction to the next and before long I forget about it.
How'd it go?
Ditto
hey
I just deleted a [censored]load of programs I don't use
That's probably a good idea
=/
I hope that wasn't meant to be sarcasm
Not at all
I'm not really in the mood for sarcasm right now
it seems like it would be
Yeah, I was legit.
k
...
um...
notepad++ seems to have disappeared though
Hmm
I wanted to keep that
Yeah, I bet it helped with web design
Oh, one more thing before I stop annoying you all.
Hm?
Yeah I saw that
Lol
I laughed, but it's accurate.
More than me
Haha
Not even.
I'm in high school.
Oh... maybe.
other things... I probably have an upper hand
yeah
lol
Like Mass Effect?
xD
XD
Yeah, probably
That's great Infamouz
XD
I don't know how something could have gotten on it in the time between the last scan and now
Where did he get it? :P
adds?
There are viruses that wait until after a scan to emerge, but they're sort of rare.
that's why I'm wondering if it's one of those random blue screens Dari was talking about
I've gotten a blue screen with this laptop
they're not just random things that mean nothing
and I've had no problem since
night all
/something/ had to have happened to cause it
I have to use McAfee
Ew.
I know
*lots
Yeah, our school requires it
it really sucks
we had to customize the settings to get on IRC?
lol @ braveheart reference
Yeah, something like that
*>
*.
yeah, for some reason it automatically blocked IRC communication
I can't think of any reason why
Well wtf
the only hardware I have plugged into this thing is a mouse and an SD card
It might be something about the netbook itself that got messed up
Nah, you can get BSoD regardless of hardware.
Anything, really. It sense a problem in rhetoric and shuts down to avoid it.
hello lev
Computers are fickle like that.
*It'll
back
My computer has had a similar problem plaguing it for a couple of years.
it says why here
\http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death
I shouldn't have eaten those shrimps x__x
it dumps it to a file
then recovers as much as it can
after restarting
It'll reboot at any time inter intermittiently, and no log is made in both of my antivirus programs. :P
This place got quiet fast
/me shuts up.
Just wait until it happens again, and you'll be prepared. :)
Yeah, I'd rather it just not happen again
It got the blue screen, but it's working now
<.<
try a system restore
the paddles!
I don't know when I'd restore to though
Most computers come with recover disks nowadays
you can whipe everything
Yeah, good point.
If it happens one more time, and you don't find the log, wipe it.
*recovery
I've already wiped this computer twice
It doesn't know that. Sh...
Why yes
Yes it did
http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=1647
Good to know.
...Awesome
Lol
if you can go to programs and accessories then system tools there should be a system restore thing
xD
Yeah, I know how to do a system restore
hm?
ok
I just don't know when I'd restore to is all
does it have bench marks?
you could restore it to last month
I like how appropriate the color blue is in a BSoD.
No bootable disk drive, remember?
oh yeah
Hmm
Well, I think we have an XP recovery disk
I could mail it to you
because you have the external disk drive now
"Firefox has determined that the following add-ons are known to cause stability or security problems"
Hmm
I get that a lot actually
I have no idea |3
I don't think I could use the XP recovery disk either
the power of an almighty dot
yeah
Yeah
wouldn't work
and deletes everything before it
why not?
Because the external CD drive doesn't work like that
Oh, it isn't for downloading
/me dual dot charges the 3rd tri-dot
just running?
Downloading?
why would there ever be downloading?
Installing I mean
I get the two mixed up
Installing is fine with normal applications
I've installed games through it before
Do they install differently?
Yeah
oh I suppose
they couldn't really install the same way
That's why my computer came with the Acer recovery thing
hmm
Would that work?
Would that work?oh
oopps
*oh
Apparently it didn't
03no idea :/

And a lot of tech forums too

is there anything currently wrong with it right now
chesticles.
uh...
Not that I can tell
hmm
infa z boobs are the woman balls
uh?
:D
ty
D;
Yeah, I mean you never know for sure, but it could just be something with the hardware
acer isnt very high on the brands
I hope not
I pretty much bought it because it was cheap and it was recommended to me
*knew
acer is good and cheap but cheap is the main word there
How dumb
Her computer might be f'ed up
you gona back it up and restore it?
Probably not
maybe if it happens again
I realize that
Just wanted to give a proper farewell.
Buh-bye...

I've known him a reallllly long time and I still don't understand how his mind works

depends on the router I think

i dont see how but i need to have a talk with my brother then...
Routers naturally block out depending on the router
He thought it would spread to his computer
It could
i can see it on emails but for a network... hmmm
i thought that you couldnt share files unless you allowed permission for that sort of thing
And then my laptop BSoD'd a couple hours ago
Kidding me?
I'm forbidden to use the family computer now because of those trojans that were on it
It'll be alright

-.- I walked half-way to school and realized I forgot a book, hopped back home, went back to school, and now I'm back.
06and since guest passes are for good reasons only, I basically sneak on campus whenever
13why is it illegal?

03trying for the other one about playing as a jockey o.o
12which one?
12oh
03how do you get OFF
12Qualified Ride or Back in the Saddle?
03once you get on?
03o.o
03first one
12and you don't
03so how does that work?
03erm
03oh
12or get bumped off
03so you have to actually kill them?
03wait
12no, just incapacitate
03hm
03that seems a lot harder to get then
12or someone else bumps you off
03and I probably can't do it on my own
12lolz
12just wait till they're lower on health
03I suppose I could always friendly-fire and murder two of my teammates
/me runs
/me 7hears thunder.
12and :O
03because that way
/me 7stuffs Larxene back into hammerspace >>
12that may come here later...
03I might try that o.o
12lolz
12btw drf
03apparently you have to kill a charger, while it's charging, with a MELEE weapon >_>
03I shot it and wa slike wtf, why didn't I get it?
12I have a theory about Survival and that Achievement
03and ?
03got to 4 minutes without going down
03but still nothing
03>:|
12the theory is that NO ONE can use anything but a Melee weapon v.v
03hm.
03well
03that means you need 4 people, right? o.o
12so we both need to use 2 controll-yah
03as the CPUs are gonna use guns
03or that
/me nods
03though, The Following or w/e it is, is the easiest place
12unless we hide the other two FAR away
03*hide
03hm
12The Passing? lol
03that
12lolz
03I might just do single-player campaign while I wait
12:o
03because, those achievements you can't get in co-op
/me nods
03since I actually finished one with you, remember?
03and still didn't get the achievement
03so eh
12yush
03I already got half of the first one just by trying to rig achievements
/me runs
12lolz
03I also got the one called Fore! about killing 16 zombies with a golf club
12XD
12try 18
03and I have about 185/200 toward the one about killing them with melee weapons
03yeah 18 same diff
burnt hair smells awfule
12did you open 5 Foot Lockers yet?
Lol

03no

03oh.
03I only did The Passing in survival
03o.o
12ah
12thats why...
12they're only in Co-Op or Single Player
03OK
03Head Honcho, I'm close to getting that one

I actually calculated it, and the President of the US is four degrees away :3
Which means he's five degrees at most from you and everyone in here
it'd be cool if he didn't suck

2Arti, check again! XD Now my avatar is of Reshiram!
13oh before i forget
12Wow
13hey
nah, I prefer keeping my avatar. Especially because it's been created by one of my most favourite artists in the world
[23:11:35] <TimeShift> reminds me of Tunisia. They had pictures of their president within every hotel, restaurant and city. Not because they wanted, but because they had to - it's called dictatorship <- urgh
12^v^

Heyyyy
Aicebooo
:D
Got the job at Walmart
:D
And get money of course
Hey
ewww
D:
And how are you today?
lol, it's mainly cleaning floors actually
well I guess someone's gotta go it..
/me should draw more of her dragoness named Nebula
I'm doing well; I got a job finally
how about you?
Haha, I suppose
I'm fine, though not much has happend to me.
12Not sure sorry
That's good
well, we even have different prices for landings
unfortunately nothing really
D;
How about you?
/me floofs Arti
nothing really here either...
I suspect there are
trying to think of things to do during the weekend...
I hate boringness lol
12^^
12I need to go
I have a couple graduation parties I may go to
plus - all other planes have strict regulations when to start and to land
when you say that do you mean teenagers illegally getting drunk and crazy? :P
No
lol
[censored].
if I did mean that I wouldn't be going
lol
fail :P
less of a "party" and more of the kids' parents just getting an excuse to get all the relatives together
hahahahahahaahahhh I hate that
XD me too
12I'm off out
and - if you takeoff, you need to stay away of the airport for at least one hour
12Seeya later
I can't stand any of them
kk - rest well Arti
Hahaha
*one
yup
2Bye Arti. *hugs*
:P
Hello Kja
because of those limitations I'm currently looking for a very, VERY noise-reduced plane. I can freely takeoff and land with it on every airfield then
owwww I'm getting one of those things where you feel like you're getting prricked at in the chest
Hahaha
They keep replaying them?
7and yeah
I think the show's over
I don't think they make it anymore
well, I'd prefer a Piper
I don't think I've ever gotten that
srsly o_O
Lol, yeah. It doesn't sound familiar anyway
it happens to some people every once in a while
it sucks you can barely move til it's done
Like heartburn?
7... which one?
7ah
7probably
Oh, because I get that a lot
Uh oh
heya Kja
ok back
hopefully none of them fell out of the cases and got scratched
nah they were on the floor already
7DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.
hai Quan
hey quan
oh
XD
hey Brother
if that makes sense
it does
How do you find the rare ones?
2Gah! I hate having a dry throat. DX
and I have all of ag's things on my computer from downloads but I don't have hard copies of them all
used CD stores
Every single song of his?
AG's I mean
actually that's a lie I need one audience of one demo
Oh wow, I'm amazed you have all the demos
...nevernmind
XD
7o3o
7Sparks?
7name*
7Busy.
/me 7shrugs
7I've only got 15 minutes before I AFK.
neon's always on and off lol
He's like all The Quiet Ones
yup
how'd i forgot the tsoaf cd I don't have that on here either ><
Yeah, the anticipation makes it exciting
I guess
or potentially makes the music more worth it
Oh, that sucks
fate was against you that day
:P
yep
went to 2 SP's that weekend neither of them had it
2Yeah, it looks questionable. o_O
got lots of other crap though :D
yeah there's only 3 of them
i'd totally live there
:D
all of them out west?
no just in washington as far as I know
one's down the road from the needle one's in northgate and one's in bellvue not that it matters
been to them all though
I don't think we even have a store that sells used CDs around here lol
and if we do the selection would be awful
Oh, nice deal
we usually only get full priced ones if it's rare/we've been looking for it everywhere
7DANG YOU, PIANO. D<
I think the lowest I've ever gotten was this EP for 1 cent
Oh wow
for a band called the graduate that opened for ludo at a show i went to a couple years ago
I flipped out
Hello
but yeah we'll go to these stores and get like 20 cds at a time for maybe 50 dollars, at regular prices you could only get 5 for that much
Hi Phoenix_Flyer
Evening guys, ;)
Oh yeah
that too
The thing that sucks around here is that if you want more than Walmart's CD selection you have to drive an hour to Best Buy
I NEVER buy cds at walmart and you shouldn't either because
me neither
way overpriced
:o
Oh really?
I knew they censored it
but not that they reverse it
><
/me yawns and starts napping
I rarely even buy music but when I have it's been from either Target or Best Buy
I've only gotten a cd from best buy once just because it had bonus tracks you couldn't get anywhere else...eh it's ok really bare though
target is pretty bare too
Best Buy has the best selection you can find offline around me
the only place where I can find a few bands that I like that isn't SP's is hot topic ><
Ugh
Hot Topic
that's a pretty good place to get cd's though too they're usually priced well
Yeah, I saw a few Alkaline CDs there once
but I hate the place XD
Yeah
They have good T-shirts too
not as cheap as I like
I got a hoodie there the other day for 10 bucks that looks like a shark's eating my face :D
Hahahaha
that's awesome
Lol, I hope you're not the type of bargain hunters that buy things you normally wouldn't just because they're on sale
no not like that :P
07lolduh
07late
07o3o
my mom's like that with groceries but with nothing else aha
Extra groceries never hurts though
:P
unless it goes old
:P
O.o
it's like he should have said something, I mean it was just sitting there...o__o getting cold...
I couldn't let that happen! D;
Wasn't that like last night?
yeah it was last night
Strange thing to stay mad about
this week's been a terrible week social wise for me
like everything I do or say is wrong
I mean I'm not hopping on buses in the middle of the night to see "friends" like his daughter is
12Back....
/me eyerolls
Oh wow
12Just heard the weirdest thing..
how old is she?
12Out in the hills
it'd probably be different if she was older
but [censored]
yeah, that's crazy
her neighbor hood is NOT safe either
hi Arti, and ok
and he just lets her go out on her own at night?
no
Ohhh
he doesn't live there :P he lives here
okay, that makes sense then
Oh yeah
Jeez
To be honest I never understood the need to run away from home at that age
where could you possibly go?
Haha yeah
"the hills are alove, with the sound of something wierd,,,"
to her friends house probably she has like 50 bajillion friends
/me rusn
I really wouldn't be suprised if she was pregnant before age 15
>.>
that bothers me
kids that young getting pregnant
yup.
seriously they need to move bad
Get to a safe neighborhood?
or at least get away from everyone there
I barely know her friends but I can already tell they're not the type of people she should be hanging out with
Yeah
12LOL!!
/me clings
12Ovo
07hai :3
12XD
12^v^

7Zekrom reminds me of Machinedramon.
03the games are fun but the creatures are just WTF
03I'm one of those "Original 150 or GTFO"

03I now officially hate Starz and Encore
03(the movie channels)
03I can't record anything off there without it locking me out of editing the file x.x
drf: it is really called Starz and encore?
03Starz is one channel
03Encore is another channel
03they're 'sisters' though, both are owned by the same company
03and they're technically 'premium' cable (like HBO and such), but my cable company gives them to us for free XD
03but shame, I want the movie Hollywood Homicide in high-definition :(
03there's no Blu-Ray of it... but it airs on Starz HD
03but if I can't USE the recording, wtf good is it
06LOL
06someone commented on my reshiram picture
04Oh, I thought you were laughing at me ;3;
03Yes, we're laughing at you
06in all honesty, those team names would make me laugh
03because you joining the channel is simply hilarious

12Feather!
12hai~
12<lte>
12*late

Did you ever figure out why he said that?
No, he denies it all. xD
I think he just misspoke and was all embaraseed.

10hihi
Lol, probably
12Ms o.o
At first I thought he was trying to say coefficient.
/me eye-rolls
/me hides
Hmm
Would make sense
/me LOLs at "MS Word"
03didn't realize that program was female
03but apparently she is
03:P
03owwwww wtf
MS Word... I dislike it... yet I also like it. Heh.
03WHY
03WOrd 2000 is like the best thing ever
03Office 2007 just fricking sucks and I hate it
03precisely
12blah
032000 is my favorite
12Ms Word x.x
032003 is alright too, but that's more or less the same thing
03well
032003 is just 2000 with a prettier interface
03plus
03PowerPOint 2000 had one thing 2003 didn't
03and that's auto-animations
Also, I do have a legit(ish) 2K3 Enterprise disc set. Hehe.
03XD
03which was copied FROM a legit disc
03I just use his serial and bingo XD
Same for 2K3. :P
03Actually, no.
03well
Ummm
03but recent copies have activation
03I have FrontPage 2003 that I got from MSDNAA and it DOES need to be activated
Nothing much... Thou?
I got the 2K3 copied from a legit university distribution (i.e. no activiation).
