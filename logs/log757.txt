Question for drawers again: To get to a get to get. How many gets do you get for the get to work?
Astronomy
CHEMISTRY!
My teacher was so boring
Thermonuclear

Chemistry
Ok Science question for you all then. Skittles motto is Taste the Rainbow. But Rainbow Dash said Rainbows aren't known for their flavor and Pinkie Pie said it was Spicy... Is Skittles lying to us?
Astronomy!
Well that's good. I find it really odd
>implying assassins creed is historicly accurate

@Perry Just Diagram a Muffin
linear algebra is boring
who asked you, i just wanted to share my opinions :(
it's repetitive
dat Equestria Girls :$ wish they had a full version~ love Pinkie's singing
Skittles was made by Pinkie Pie when she took out RD's guts and turned them into Candy!
DRAW ALGEBRA
@Imperator ew...
Use this equation. JOJ = A10vR-4G1N
SILAS
i'm going next door!
a) earth rainbows are not ponyville rainbows b) skittles are fruit in the same color as rainbows
Perry, that's my favorite Pink Floyd album you're drawing there.

IM HERE.............
aw, it messed up.
BECUASE OF PONIES!
Oh my gosh, is Perry drawing my request? Eeeeee!
-_(\
@Rommel Well yeah that's the problem. Skittles don't taste like anything really. They have a hint of a flavor that may or may not be a fruit that may or may not have existed.
00,02Really important that i dont explode

00,02aniderp, hasnt hit 24h yet

Do any of you have an OC?

restarting the call because of technical difficulties, please stand by.
i wanna say one thing about it when it does hit that mark
00,02but tbh i'm about to go on a tf2 server where they'll spoiler anyway
thanks :)
@Johnny I Do!
There you are. And I have a few OC's.
Well, I do, but they're kind of a crossover concept.
@unity now I have to ask is it a good oc?
*sadface* I would join but at my dad's this weekend
Darn makes me wish I had my computer
привет всем:D
I'm just curious about OC's. I haven't done one but I write my character Johnny Northrain in a fic. OC's are just kinda too much for me but seeing how people do them is interesting. What colors, names and marks they choose.
agggggg the fine bros are trying to screw us:S
@Johnny http://i1245.photobucket.com/albums/gg589/cluttered-closet/SCAN0259.jpg You Decide :)

pony_6353 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=my+little+pony+friendship+is+magic+season+3+episode+3
Question; If you were on a dessert island and you had a choice betwen Chocolate milk rain, Marsapan palm trees, Nutella filled biscuit shelled crabs or Cotton Candy Clouds what would you eat first?
Also, Hasbro allow pony episodes on the internet

Jagex dun goof
Canadian_Brony|TF2: you broke my computer with that link to much to comprehend
It's going to Steam

If you could travel to any country that you've not yet been to where would you go, what would you want to see and would you know the language?
Spell-of-Gaming, but you already have it, so?
Wait. If the rain is chocolate. Shouldn't the ocean be chocolate too?
Spell-of-Gaming, I quit that game ever since the EOC update.
Question: Favorite breakfast food?
perhaps muffin perhaps
Phase4 i made my wii get a stack overflow
since I heard about it that is
I've never left the USA, but I've got three choices.
Mr_Anybody how? It's a link that links you the original source page by Googling it for you. I could see how the meta could melt your brain, but your computer should be fine.
Unless it has, like, 1 gig ram
bass cannon
my computer is a robot that behaves like a human
it's very possible
so, a robotic Lyra?
na
seems legit
just a robot end of discussion
Honestly I'm just playing Maplestory for now

How I got into MLP by Johnny. Well... My life was going great until my roomate decided to just bail on the apartment and I was left high and dry. This was two days before I went to Seattle, a trip I planned for months and had already spent a lot of money for...
Pinkie hugging twilight was weird
indeed
especially that orange bird
Pinkie seemed OOC for the first half of that episode
I was pretty drunk and depressed and saw MLP on netflix. I needed something cute to watch and I went through the first two episodes not really caring about it. By the forth I was hooked but I went to Seattle.
well im off to bed :) good night yall
hi eveypony

While there I met a guy who owned a toy shop and kept going on about how horrible Bronies were.... not knowing I was on the teetering point of becoming one
Didn't she seem kinda OOC?

@perry so you said you'd sing the flim flam brother's song with someone else singing the other half. Are you actually up to that?
i forgot to tell u that i was on a ship for 14 day
What one of my friends does to clean their cards is soak out as much of the liquid from them they can, let them dry, then use just a small amount of Windex to wipe them off with (don't touch the borders) to keep them from staying sticky.
i guess these chats aren't my thing just sit here and stare at it lol
something are you leaving?

Bronystate has accounts? lol
Well, this is peculiar.
Mi ex ilegalmente la tomó y dijo que era parte del acuerdo

Out of curiosity, did the Scottish Scootaloo I ended up requesting earlier get done? It's fine if it didn't, I understand that there were a lot of requests.
are you going to colorate Rarity?
ilegalmente?
I think that means illegal
ahh okay

hi AJIsAwesome :)
Hi pot80 :)
Well sorry not Opinion i think its called otherwise but i dont know the word XD

Temperton you should revise your question to be also transformed to a pony
Im sorry I would too lol
If you could go to Equestria once, you can ask Twilight to help you get back again
100 million is so much
/me vigorously shakes GamerLuna's hand
always have to consider twilight or celestia being able to use a magic to keep you there
take money fund portal
i would take the one day
Twilight always wants to help
it looks good pot80
how are things GamerLuna
shakes pot80 hand back, how are you pot80 ?
thanks alexxm
Besides. Fluttershy would like us. We look like apes-monkey-gorillas.
Lyra would help!
I'm average atm, you?
Question: Cookie or Portal gun?
Oh, things are good alexxm
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
First go to Lyra, she would help to talk with Twilight.
Portal gun is incredibly dangerous without long fall boots
*le gasp* HI GamerLuna !
portal gun, no more walking to reach cookies
Portal 1 at home, portal 2 in the cookie fabric
So you sell it to someone for 100 million Euros :V
Hi there RAINBOWFAN

I'm back :D
Sleeping is best time of the day. Oo
me iz fine too
"the superpower to have any superpower that i want".
Question: Nightmare Moon vs Freddy Kruger, who will win?
Being allmighty contains everything you can imagine, and MORE
Good to hear Invi
weeping angel
I would actually be quite scared of being offered the chance to gain a super power if there were a realistic chance of that happening.
Weeping angels take you back in time while the SCP just kills you

Mon français est aussi agile qu'un paraplégique à l'épilepsie
To expand on the stuff about horror games, what do you think about Story of the Blanks?
depends if I sparkle or not
non-twilight
Depends if I you have the full controll about transformations into a werewolf

Un perro es igual de bueno, pero yo soy alérgico a ellos.
RAINBOWFAN, GTA Ponyville, should make a game like that
K:(
I wish I could stay away forever without needing to sleep at all
Ya? really, GamerLuna?
My bed is too fluffy
FanCamp: That sucks, dogs are pretty good pets.
Magic generally uses the cutie mark colour
yep, RAINBOWFAN
Pfft, ferrets are best pets
... It does
OH
B.R.B I need to make myself breakfast.
Well that just blew my mind
well s1 was eye color
s2 is more by cutiemark color
there are exceptions
Cool, I didn't know that either.
Question: What is the best headwear?
OK, I've got to go and visit relatives, should be back later.
Si tuviera un perro, yo haría usar muchos sombreros y recrear TF2 repeticiones con ellos.

Usted no puede hacer eso con los gatos, pero no estoy impedido
BRETHREN! I'm FINALLY back from CANADA!

¿Qué pasa con esta persona? Tales actos haría Arturo rollo Lima en su tumba! http://fav.me/d5g2meu
Hello people.
Hi
Question: What do you think about that MLP Gameloft game for Smartphones?
hi yavos
Would you like to add me? ;)
if you could get anything you ever desired, but you had to give up art to obtain it, would you take it?
WUT

..........................................
What Sumica said: if you deactivate your wifi/internet on the tablet/phone you can get many things for money instead the other stuff
WUT
I only need Magnum, then I have everything you can buy with bits, lol
not just that Yavos, all the timers in game go by the phones set time and how long sence the game last looked at the time
:[PONIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ...GIMME ME PONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ...
Are the Villains of MLP realy evil or just Misunderstood ?
so if you set the time to the next day you collect the dalily bonus
Afternoon guys.
Nightmare Moon is misunderstood
and the shops job time advances
Pretty sure Sumbra was evil
Chrysalis is evil
And evil. Largely evil.
Sombra*
Crysalis just wants loooooooove
@Sumica yeah, the time cheat is pretty nice... but some people encountered a problem after a certain date where they didn't get any bonus anymore
Si continúa, sin duda le dará a todos los bronies un mal nombre! Arturo Lima no va a funcionar con Lauren Faust! http://fav.me/d5ga5vu
And Chrysalis takes it rather than trying to earn it. Evil.
hmm
She wants power
I fail to understand how conquering Equestria would give you love
Discord just wants to play
mind you you cant get bonuses for day you already got them
Discord isn't evil, he is an omnipotent troll
She has power over illusion and the mind, evidently. She can force love.
@RandomNinja in Equestria live a lot of ponies that do have that love. You just have to collect it then.
With a love net.
@Yavos it would be easier to blend in and get friends
NMM did it for revenge, Discord did it for fun and revenge, crysalis did it for love and to survive. Sombra did it for... uuhhhh... yeah...
I guess Changelings don't know how to make friends.
CRYSTALS...
crystals
Gilda is evil, because she only accepts "cool" ponies
Gilda is just a bitch
pfft coolness
Si solo traductor Google podría acercarnos podríamos terminar esta calumnia mal! http://fav.me/d5gjqx2
Just wanna say to the artists good job keep it up!
Being unpleasent doesn't make you evil though.
@yavos possible
what's with the foreign language guy?
they do seem rather stupid
no idea he's been here most of the day from what i can tell
Question: Do you like mmmmmm... Bananas?
I wouldn't say that. They did successfully infultrate a kingdom undetected.
Este espectáculo es el único espectáculo que me da algo de luz a enfrentar el día.
we already had that question earlier alex :P
still, Chrysalis seemingly only fed of Shining's love for Cadence (directed at her). You can't force love.
damn, i wasn't here D:
TO THE MOON!
if you could be someone else for 1 week, who would it be?
can I be God?
@RandomNinja No, but you can...harvest the love of someone else through illusion and whatever.
hm
If you would be Cats,how would you look like ?
Hello everyone, how are you?
A changeling who can transform into god, and use it's power then
hi
Create the ultimate muffin?
Well I'm off, I really need sleep before the exams
But they don't have new powers when they transform.
Bye~
@Alex no they can't
D:
They always keep their old powers
Chrysalis had those spells
A red Perry cat
Maybe is special changeling magic?
the Cheshire cat
bye AdamTheDuck good luck
Chrysalis had those spells because she had them before, too.
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI!

You have to own atleast 3 guns to live in Texas
If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a song about him?

I once looked at the german MLP magazine, but I didn't like it that much.
at least
13asuka's registered but not linked to me so..
DoctoDoctorWho THANK YOU MASTER
It'sso great!
You learn for example that you should never trust a zebra.
And that Scootaloo is actually Celestias daughter and is named Terry.
Really? xD
If you could be any kind of tree what kind of tree would you be?
13no idea if this will work but Venus i'm wondering if maybe irssi doesn't unban if you lose connection before the timer's up
/me speakes an encoded message entirely through flexing of the muscles.
German MLP magazin I don't even- <3
No, that was a fake comic
well everypony im off to Vegas, bai everypony :$

Vordox: commendable, but now taste the destructive power, of my PERSONAL THEME SONG! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjlBCAx6330

Wrek: did you do your agent dashie entirely in SAI?
Vordox: http://www.twitch.tv/superbrony64?utm_campaign=live_embed_click&utm_source=www-cdn.jtvnw.net
Safari|colt: So if it's not embedding.. it's not a stream on Bronystate... is it?
aw shucks, thank you!
I REALLY like mer mane?

Kujo_Jojo, what are you doing?
11,02Just go to the link you see in the embed and you'll see the stream.

Vordox: Yeah but we're popping the chat out so it counts

11,02If you can see it fine here, then no worries :)
Do you think Scootaloo will be able to fly one day ?
J_E_Smith71: Lawl, no?
Alright i'm back and I finished the episode.
13sb, maybe you should use a stream service we can actually embed?
J_E_Smith71: I could pop out this chat and have a perma stream on someone else's behalf =P
SuperBrony64: Oh wait the stream is embedding on Bronystate aftera;;
Request addendum: For the parasprite-tribble boxing if it hasn’t been done. The little ring in the foreground with Lyra as if she was walking by and noticed it. A little thought bubble coming from her showing arms crossed out with something like an X. Under the image a little segment showing magic effect holding up glue, two popsicle sticks snapped in the middle, and 4 little boxing gloves.
AttackWithHugs he is my master in manliness training
11,02Shizuka: Can't unless someone wants to restream me.
Shizuka: I just hit play and the stream is embedding here after all.
Vordox: It's only due to technical issues. It was embedded but that capped the number of users so he did it this way. It's still a stream.
Kujo_Jojo: Thank you, now let us hug AttackWithHugs, TOGETHER!
http://www.redbubble.com/people/perrydotto
Vordox samew here :P Maxthon can pop out everything that uses Flash
SuperBrony64 urm i'm still on the bronystate stream and i can see a system update page for the wii u in the stream box

Okay I hear something now
SuperBrony64: i keeps kicking me off brony state to the site

11,02DashWithRainbows: Call of Duty Black Ops II, New Super Mario Bros. U, Nintendo Land, and Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed.
Finally the darn picture is done.
I see Joomay is AFK
DashWithRainbows i know i was just saying that that shows that the stream does work here despite what they were saying
Waiting for an update SuperBrony64?
Does the Wii U have backwards compatibility?
brb, need to take a shower :3
everyone order a Nuclear Luna t-shirt!
So SuperBrony64, how excited are you?
Some decent games you got there SB. I've been looking at CoD: Bo2, looks pretty good :P
CriticKitten: yes
CriticKitten: Wii only no Gamecube
I'd hope it does, but I can't seem to take that for granted any more.
Nuclear Luna ftw!
No Gamecube? But that means no more Baten Kaitos.
;_;
System updates ftw!
11,02Everlasting_Joy: Very :3
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh
11,02About 5% done I would say >>;

How can I play a new Nintendo system without one of the least commonly known yet awesomely great games? *cry* :(
https://twitter.com/BroniesForGood/status/270246242242662401 RT FOR AUCTION!
SuperBrony64: o great >_> its been going for like 10 mins now?
Did you get the deluxe WiiU SuperBrony64?
Scandinavian gryphons are owl/wolf mix
I just made that up
you're welcome
that would be cool though
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh
I might have to draw that for the lulz
SuperBrony64: This is going to be an awesome Zen stream then, if it's only 5% done, gonna be really meditative |3
@BFG: Uh, shouldn't that say "canvas", not "canves"?
is the stream still on the system update page for everyone else
:P
does gabby have a tumblr or a DA i can follow?
11,02Breath in....
alexxm: Yep.

alexxm: yes
SuperBrony64 I can't breathe though.
Tommekke. D:
I find that extremely offensive.
@question: who not ask some of the VA's to retweet that auction?
/me relaxes
Vordox: You see the Twitch feed? Just push play
Imagine your emotional urges as a vast sea.
Tara would break the stream from traffic
Layer

Now visualize yourself above that sea, observing it silently. Do not try to influence it, let it be.

11,02Going to put on Xbox games until this update is done :3
xD
SuperBrony64: Is there a way instead of that link, you can put a Push Play to See Stream on there? That's all that needs to be done to have it embed here
Remember that you are above your emotional influences, they are a part of you, but you are the one who directs them.
cool :3
NOOOOOOO
Darn.
Spellchecked the Ebay item but not the tweet.

Are you going to do this again soon?
I will join after this match
<3
especially those 12-yr-old with a mic. I'm fine if they play it, no one knows who you really are in these games, but don't give 'em a mic.
Was anyone here in phase4 tf2 stream last night?
yesh
why?
poor perry been up the whole time
I was playin with him\
BlaxBlain: I wish, what happened?
BlaxBlain me too :)
Awesome!
Everlasting_Joy he was playing on a Vs. Ponyville server. It was . . . interesting.
Should I put my mic on or off when I join?
Canadian_Brony: Those always are :).
Perry's young she can handle it
@Diagon your request is ready: http://fav.me/d5li381
Kirby <3.
hmmm, do i actually patch my xbox to play this
05xbox has fucked up the progress of modern graphical fidelity >:C
What is SB64 playin?
Vordox CoD BO1.
Wrek not really, PC's are still looking better and better
Cod bo1
Do we have VOX on black ops?
DashWithRainbows: Is it able to play via PC to Xbox?
its just publishers and manufaactorers dont want to risk new hardware
just found out why i got the ban screen. my stealthy was active. no dea when that happended. but yeah :P
He's streaming his console I believe.
manufacturer*
Which I want to know how he does that.
DashWithRainbows: What's why I asked
05Chrysalis: coutner proof: Crysis 1 looks more or less better and/or the same as the latest one. the latest one is built in newest tech, the first crysis on 07 tehcnology
that's
DashWithRainbows: I believe he has a capture card
Wrek: Why is your dad in the hospital?
oh yeah, however the new one ran nearly 3 times as fast
So if Discord had a Coconut, what would he turn it into being the embodiment of chaos.
Guys, want my mic on or off?
?
oni_link I'll have to ask him when he isn't streaming at some point.
and the original wasnt based in 07 tech
When I join
still stream being streames? cool
it was made to push future computers
SuperBrony64: is it able for me to play via PC on your Xbox match?
40K?
On if you like BlaxBlain
whereas the newer one was made to push current computers
05he had side pains, enoug hto warrant a trip to the ER. nor the "i has gas" kind of pain
DashWithRainbows: let me know what he tells you, I want to know as well.
the pinkie lisa looks so cute
DashWithRainbows eeyup, 360. He uses a graphics card and video input splitter. The graphics card sends input to his computer and the video input splitter allows him to play on his TV and have the same video sent to his computer.
Vordox No, you'd have to play on Xbox to play in his game.
or Monty Python Spanish Inquisition?
I'll try not to talk as much as I did in the TF2 stream
Ponies grimdark: Sugar shortage
Warhammer 40k
DashWithRainbows: Aaand I lost interest in Xbox...forever+1
On BlaxBlain
05not*
What else floats? Small rocks!
'kay-'kay.
Alrighty
i've just realised that this giant map of the part of the world where the ponies live, is atleast 10x bigger than our earth
is that a mona lisa pinkie pie?
DoctoDoctorWho: Is it smaller then PLuto?
Games almoast over should be joining soon.
@Perry Have you seen that Star Trek FMV game with Q and the Borg?
Vordox: thats how its always been, only game iirc that had cross platform play was shadowrun
Canadian_Brony I'll ask him which types he uses and how he does it completely.
Dat Moon
hahahahaha
oni_link: Portal 2
Vordox: or Portal 2. I forgot about that as well
Vordox: eenope
DoctoDoctorWho . . . knowing our local sexual philanthropist has a rather similar nick, I took that in a disturbingly wrong way..
Does Q even have nuts?
Well now Im confused.
Phase4 landed on the moon last night on kerbel space program.
I like that game over where they all just walk off
Anyone else spend far more time in zombies than MP on these games?
Canadian_Brony: that was best non-naming reference to anyone else XD
damnit I missed it.
Chrysalis: Me.
@alex how come?
I just realized SB is using the FAMAS...
Zombies is easily the best part of these games
Canadian_Brony: I wonder if he's still here?
One doth protest too much
everyone on my friends list is either playing black ops 2 or halo 4 dammit
ProTip: Q is a Squirrel
Chrysalis: thats what everyone I know that owns these games tells me. They bought the second one for that reason as well.
^
I would complain about the famas but SuperBrony64 is just too cool!
Chrysalis hells. Fucking. Yes. Non-stop Ascension is what I do. I only do MP on MWII and CoDIII
oni_link i will be buying it when its cheaper

hell yes dinner and stream
FAL dual mag > Famas.
Question; Given the vastness of the universe and that we are just small points on a grand cosmic scale would you say it's easily justifiable to eat an entire cake in one sitting like Pinkpie Pie?
just waiting for when they release it as its own game
will be the best thing
11,0260-65% complete
Another win!
Is that BS Bronystate SuperBrony64?
dont care about the SP or the MP
zombiez ftw
11,02Yesh DerpyMuffins :3
Necular Luna is awesome
@Cheeseball So if Equestria is as big as the USA
Joining
hmmm, wonder if my xbox and BO can patch faster than your wiiu
i tried to join dammit
SuperBrony64: Did you get my message? o3o
Yes, it would.
Chrysalis: me too but think about it. by the time it becomes cheaper, the next one will be on its way.
/me wants some feels
Have you guys played tf2?
<3
11,02Moooo :3
If you do it while shouting and flailing with your arms JohnnyNorthrain, you should be OK.
/me gives DoctoDoctorWho feels
he should start a private match for people on bronystate
:D
/me huggles DoctoDoctorWho :D
:D
Hey guys
that was me, my bad :D
http://asknuclearluna.tumblr.com/post/35993585835/
true, but im not paying full price for 3 seperate entities when i only care about one
Game is starting up!
yay. happy derpy is finished
I'd say both pronounciations are valid
so are they in a public match or private?
sorry SuperBrony64, I had to do that :P
/me Glomps DoctoDoctorWho
/me huggles SuperBrony64 back
What class?
SuperBrony64: MOOOO <3
Neigh.
DashWithRainbows just about any gun is better than the Famas. They ruined the guns in Black Ops. Famas is automatic and underpowered, secondaries are just f*cking useless, and you can put a lot less crap on your shotguns. You know it's a sad day when you see a Silenced SPAS
nah
Kujo_Jojo: :)
I have about 10
I got close to 1600 hours in tf2... gah
bonjour
Gee, I wish I still had this game, I wanna play with SB now :3
hi RAWRity
ak 47 is best assaulkt rifle
DoctoDoctorWho:)
You reload at the worst of times SuperBrony64
Medic is credit to team!
Canadian_Brony: Yeah I used to use that XD
Um, Canadian_Brony... The Famas is well known for being OP.
hello
I just never could get into TF2, It's not my bag baby
Eli | AJIsAwesome: you're also hard to tab... with aji online
that happens to be my super power
I like engineer for the same reason
The Guild!
DerpyMuffins: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....
Screw wimpy guns, I want a rocket launcher or a manual anti-tank rifle :D
Yep, it's been scientifically proven one medic is the most importart difference to a team
@pony_489367 yes, it is a mona lisa pinkie!
*cough*M16*cough*
I want a BFG
^^^^
Besides, Pistols in the game are still good! Freaking CZ76 with extended clip = my waifu
m16
?
And the FAL
Oh god, I love my semi-automatics.
/me ffall sover dying of laughter
brb
Im more inclined to used semi-auto rifles, theyre more fun imo
m16 syc==ucks
MadSurge PANZERFAUST *shooom*
05the m16 is a silyl weapon
tweet and ask if any of the other VAs would like to join
since when doies burst of three beat semi auto of full auto?
Also, hardcore made this game so much more fun
05prefer higher caliber
oh lawd, foal papers on twitter got a G3 face now too
its everywhere
if you have the m16 with acog on hardcore you kick ass
M16 on hardcore is beast.
Kurra: I prefer Doom or arcade laser gun games :3
I loved it on HCHQ
pisols are generally better i found on hardcore
/me prefers a mossberg 500 shotgun as weapon of choice
also thing of how many grains of powder are behind each bullet, that matters possibly more
fnfal is best if u know how to use it
aaaaannnd I killed chat .-.
is there a stream going on right now?
the only reason i still use m16 is becasue of hardcore gamemodes
DashWithRainbows I still prefer MWII. Three-burst Famas with a SPAS. You could go for the nuke on that loadout.
A little request: Humanised Celestia as lady justice (not blindfolded), and of course a bit godlike? Maybe it sucks, dunno ^^"
question: how important is mlp for you? how much time do you spend on mlp stuff?
Yeah, that's OP, Canadian_Brony.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: Earbuds, Belt Buckle, Wrapping Paper, and More!
Famas and Spas in that game were really OP.
hello everypony
Howdy vinyl!
/me doesn't understand all this gun talk so just smiles and nods
SuperBrony64: I remeber when you joined ma minecraft game on xbox, the one with all the ponies, and you where just frollicking around :3
DashWithRainbows could something be OP if everything else is too?
YokusaHHart: Let me translate. "bla bla bla bla bla GUNS bla bla KILLING AND MURDERING bla bla bla Hero bla bla."
DashWithRainbows Gotta say single shot weapons in BLOPS 2 are powerful i use the FAL and it's god damn easy to kill with though it's not fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. It's limited to how fast you can press so shucks it's usually best for medium long range fights
Is it okay if I say the Mossberg 500 is a really badass gun?
which stream is hers?
Perrydotto
Hi everypony!
ah, thsnks Vordox! I'm more of a blade person :3
@Tomekke added
killerpony7733 Blame people complaining about quick-fire modded controllers.
Camera not currently focusing on it at the momemnt
I used to have one, got rid of it.
back
^moment
I still think the Aspergers 400 is the best Weapon
I kinda don't like how they toned down the gore and dismemberment of the bodies when they get blown up or shot at point blank range with shotguns like in World at War.
All in the trigger finger, baby!
YokusaHHart: Same, i prefer where you actually use weapons, and not just aim them
katana ftw
thanks yavos
hello everypony
hi vinylscratch
ninjato ftw!
Hai vinylscratch
YokusaHHart: Glory to the scottish claymore
DashWithRainbows Yeah i remember MW1 with it's weapons being fire as fast as you as you can press the mouse button. Made the battle rifle they had awesome. But yeah >.>
backstab
That Awkward Moment when you become emotionaly imversed and cheer for a guy running his heart out to catch a bus, only to realize he was just excersizing...
you know what xbox needs, a way to cancel an update
YokusaHHart same here
how are things vinylscratch
i notice i havent seen perrydoto's stream on screen in a while. or did i just look away at the wrong moment
ss
Lil_B is that actually a real game weapon?? o_o
DoctoDoctorWho: that's my second favorite sword
YokusaHHart: 1st?
Kurra no xD
Yeah Perry's stream is not on screen
just clear system cache and glicthes work again
DoctoDoctorWho: I just said, Ninjato :)
Are we allowed to ask questions?
you are
Yes Caramel
Ok, thank you...just making sure.
ask as many questions as you want! :D
oh there
oh, k
Necular Luna is not debatable...
there is Perry
You don't want that Yavos :3
I'm more for Bo
Then swords persoinally
I will say that the best thing in the Black ops series has got to be dual mag/ quick mag
@Tomekke actually we want many questions
GG
11,02Oh wow, you almost had us BlaxBlain O.O

Have fun MLP_Brovakiin!
Everlasting_Joy: I will, thanks :D
oh no.
You can also request things. We will write down your request in a list and if someone feels like doing it, it will be done
Do the artists make some special preparation for this stream? Like putting a special cussion or so :3
/me kills jelonheoh
doctor who can only regenerate so many times
12 times
jelonheoh: just a name, Im actually not the doctor.
but you cannot jelonheoh
are you so sure Kujo_Jojo?
General Request: Celestia in a Gala Dress!
but what happends after the stream? do they do the request another day and put it on twitter or something?
mostly sure jelonheoh
jelonheoh, though did that one in season 4 finale count?
like before the special
lets test it
/me stares at DoctorDoctorWho, and everyone who burns banners, and raises cool blue chill murray banner, guys, calm down
Anyone want to take the shipping on a ship request?
:D
If I were to show my face, I'd look a little like this.
Request: Carrot Top eating a sandwhich
Show us your butt then!

so we're having a fight then?!! http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdk0j7Ug9U1rvfvyv.gif
|D
Who are your favorite actor?
where can I pester him?
@Herp some of these ideas might be used, but there's no guarantee
/me raises the flag of overcast skies, nullifies the NLR and whatever the sun ponies are on about....
Behold the Union Jack! |D
@Carrot_Top you already have Carrot Top eating a carrot listed. I'm not gonna add this one :P
It helps if they can talk back to you in Spanish. Otherwise you are just being strange
I sent a request a bit ago if you would like, Perry.
Aw okay :3
/me pulles the solar empire banner higher
Back to cleaning >:U
how are you? Jack here!
/me unleashes Jeremy Clarkson with a hammer Xp

BRB gotta go take out some trash!
Question for DeathPwny: What Program are you using?
suikuzu is so gonne be watched on dA by me from now on...
11,02It finished downloading all the stuff, now it's updating, which is going by much faster
I hope so muffinexplosion, she's a really good artist :3
SuperBrony64, so basically you have slow internet?
13THRILL at the state of modern console gaming
Kujo_Jojo: If you dont mind, I have 1 request
13presented to you LIVE in GLORIOUS 640x480 resolution
Gimp won't work on my computer for some reason. ;/
11,02CrystalPhoenix: No, but I'm sure Nintendo's servers are being slamed right now :/
*:/
oh, hi tom
oh great, more PC vs console stuff
SuperBrony64, good point
hi patec
DoctoDoctorWho what is it my Master
keep making donations guys!
Kujo_Jojo: Dont call me master, call me teacher.
11,02You hear audio right?
Bronysith, you're right there shouldn't be a debate
yes teacher
Yes
SuperBrony64 Yap
That is all I am
Everyone knows the PC is better
Hey, 640x480 is GREAT resolution. Yo uguys have no idea how fun 640x480x256 colors can be!
11,02256 colors? Spoiled...
/me finishes saying that with a Sweetie Belle voicecrack!
hehehe
do it for the chickens! I mean, kids
art=awesome
@Lunar_Eclipsed added
Question for DeathPwny: What dimensions does your current drawing have?
Early 90s Mac gaming was awesome.
i had Gimp before...It gave me plug-in errors :P
honest.
PC's are awesome O3O
DoctoDoctorWho what is it maste... i mean teacher
what game did they have Kurra
SuperBrony64: Yeah, audio is fine.
13pff 320x240 16 color was where it was at
That's what it's giving me Carrot!
13speaking of i was going to try to get carmen sandiego DOS working but VM doesn't want to do sound with it
Well :P
Escape Velocity, um... well I forget the names of the rest but I have them stored away. Barrack...
well...
ty ;)
Hey shizu have you finished quake 4 yet?
13yep
13tron too
Awww
here everypony, Mac games from like 1993 - 2010: http://www.ambrosiasw.com/
Hmmm?
Whats going on?
you were using god mod on tron shizu. but it was still awesome
There was a Joust clone, there was even a 68040 processor 3D driving game!
mode*
We need more questions!
How long does the stream have left now?
and donations
13yes but ponies should know by now that i consider restarts to be horribly boring stream material
Rex_Mundi: We're about to witness some WiiU goodness
Kurra, this is what I thought while reading that url http://layton.wikia.com/wiki/The_City_of_Ambrosia
And there were lots of little cool time waster games, and um....
I cant think of computer gibberish without this coming to mind anymore. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdlu8q5p0r1rxmai6o1_1280.jpg
2 hours, 45 minutes are left
What did the artists do this weekend then :3
I'm back and ready to watch some wiiU
And did they eat cereals as breakfast
DoctoDoctorWho, of Jay Naylor?
Do you like the day or the night the most?
MechWarrior 2 was out by 1995, and that was HOURS and hours of fun and action, even though today it looks like wireframe pre-render.
oooooh I see
Had to refresh the stream
hehehe
Good gaming way back then. Even the Mac's System 7.5.3 had a hidden credits game embedded.
Am i the only one who thinks that the premise of the latest episode was kinda disturbing? What exactly happens to you if you get sent "back to the pond"? O.o
11,02Console is restarting :)
Which one of the for elements do you like the most / describe you best?
Avara was BAWSS fun.
four*
Rex_Mundi: Death
:D What are we going to watch him play?
Which is better, persona 3 or 4?
But Escape Velocity was likely king of the 90 Mac gaming era, and lives on in EV:Override and EV:Nova.
Rex_Mundi: the others were artificial, they had no true sentience
Bronysith, it depends alot
Bronysith: Persona 4 IMO
Persona 3 has a lot of grind
Tomekke, your questions are ignored as it seems. xD
DoctoDoctorWho: Do we know that?
and Persona 4 is quite more popular
maybe you should've added question marks
well.. they don't have questionmarks
it seems yes
13the mirror pond was likely cloning
Ooh SuperBrony64 make a Jacko Mii XD
ok!
but I love the end moral in Persona 3
@Lingonrise Did you mean Earth, Air, Fire, Water rather than the Elements of Harmony?
Or nono, make a Lauren F. mii!
I will add questionmarks :3
Both
13the alternate theory that it's an alternate universe doesn't hold up once 2+ pinkies started summoning copies
is salahir doing my request?
Can't bring your old Miis over?
but i thought there is like an eternal rivalry between P3 and P4 fans?
11,02J_E_Smith71: You can :)
Luna on moon? that's already done
@Diagon it is already finished
11,02Doing it now
THIS SONG
WHY NINTENDO
Shizuka perhaps infinte universes is at work
@Diagon http://fav.me/d5li381
Or worse than death, non-existance...
SOunds like Fairy's Fountain....
Rex_Mundi: they were all preprogrammed with pinkies intelligence, if they were "created", and had seperate souls, they would start knowing nothing and have to live their own lives.
YokusaHHart, exactly
well not now
We didn't notice he was missing at the stream until it was too late, sorry about that :/
alexxm Or perhaps it's simply good ol' magic that makes copies or duplicates if you will?
wb JJ
Welcome back JJ! :D
Also Bronysith I do believe there is but quite a few do love both
Suiku is doing my request! Yay!
Are we talking about the ending to the new episode? If we are, I'll be over here, not caring.
and there are even some that love the classics like Persona 2 better
CrystalPhoenix: but there is that eternal rivalry, like FFVII vs FFVI
13alexxm: yeah but in order for that to be consistent, the mirror pool would always lead to a new universe and never back
eyebrows the internet
Ok, so what did the artist do during the weekend? And did they eat cereals this morning? :3
13one pinkie goes through, arrives in a universe containing a pinkie, they go through and find another pinkie
13it would go up by 1 each time, not 2, 4, 6
Shizuka, reminds me of the Lost Room, where there's an infinity of rooms that can be reset.
killerpony7733 yeah that works i was just pointing out that infinite universes could be used to help that
Earth
ok good point Shizuka
13the alternate alternative would be it sends you to a mirror of the current universe, so two pinkies step through into a universe already containing two pinkies
"We're about to run the biggest con game in the history of the multi-verse"~Cave Johnson.
Bronysith, to be honest I can't tell you how big the rivalry is but both games are arguably better than the other that's for sure
see? questionmarks!
Did you guys have your daily ... Applejacks? ;)
If they sent the original pinkie back, I imagine she would be trapped, Behind the mirror if you will.
question marks. And your questions will be answered. xD
since they are both kinda different to each other
Maybe a pocke demension, filled with the ponies that were sent back?
man, those question marks are good
I agree with the mirror theory
I don't know what's better
that face near the end..
the discussion of what is on the other side of the pond or is Twilight Sparkle a murderer
Solar flares
huh there really is static on
Nintendo finally moves up to a password system like XBLA and PSN
Question: What is your favorite part of drawing ponies? Least favorite?
I like how people need complex explanations for a universe that holds ponies that can use magic for example. So why can't it just be good ol' magic which can make a exact mirror copy of a pony?
CrystalPhoenix: they were artificial constructs programmed to act like the host
killerpony7733: cause people like to overanaylyze
DoctoDoctorWho, we are not going into that
killerpony7733 thats what i thought what bugs me is who found out how it worked
Can we vote for TV movies for BMN? Because actually, I'd want us to see The Lost Room. That was a fascinating little show.
Skype
Wat r u doin
Skype
RESTART
it's doing strange things
Kurra: Yeah we had a TV movie here, they are Bs automatically
Bronysith True dat. But hey it's atleast a tad amusing to see and hear. Though the explanation can be so simple and needs no further explanation
:P
What happend?
cool.
strange noises
Kurra we watched one of the discworld movies made by sky so yeah
killerpony7733: Agreed, on your "complex analysis" statement.
XD, rooter
What if the minds of the clones still exist somewhere within the Mirror Pool's dimension?
yo
i made it as planned
oh nevermind, it's a mniniseries, too long for BMN
hey jose
Stupid Skype
And finally, the WiiU ladies and gentlemen
WAKAWAKA
the WiiU Prepasring screen : O
If you turned off a robot that was programed to mimic human emotions, are you a murderer?
hey hurr ^^
Maybe a Portal to the G3 universe?
Everlasting_Joy Sometimes the most simplest answer is the right one :)
ok i assume it's all just magic but who found out how it worked and how did they do it
Kurra: We had a long TV movie/miniseries before, that was over 3 hours
O RLY?
hey alex
DoctoDoctorWho, not if the robot can turn on again
killerpony7733: If anything, people are analyzing something that doesn't need it.
and hello cs
Join the Nintendo fun Club today!
the lost room is SO MIND BENDINGLY fascinating ammagosh soooo werth seeing ffffs
Oh Flash.
lol
DISCOOOOOOORD
killerpony7733: Question, do you honestly think anyone on the show is a promoter of genocide?
So all of those Miis represent other users, right?
technical difficulties! please stand by!
Reload
Everlasting_Joy: I like my fictional universes to work as settings, thus discussions like this are nessisary.
nmnbmn
lol
That large Mii gathering room
oh, flash crashed again...
and the advertisement will flush D:
flash plugin crashed
it happens a lot when i use firefox and it's ridiculous
Everlasting_Joy I can't really tell if i think so. Maybe maybe not :D
lolol ads
I can almost feel the native 1080p 60fps
um..
Im not getting into this
great, I absolutely hate commercials that can't be skipped or at least muted
http://i.qkme.me/3554v3.jpg
I really can't take this discussion seriously.
Rex_Mundi ok we know magic exsits so blame it on that but who found out about the pound and how it worked
System mute option/volume mixer still works!
BlaxBlain: Well soon once the game starts we
11,02i wanna see what's on the eshop :3
have that to talk about
Yeah, but that usually mutes everything
alexxm: Discord maybe?
hurr, did you get that skype right now?
That Pinkie is better then the origonal
Request: Either human or pony Luna and Celestia together looking up at a light blue sky where the moon is just visible. Something along the line of “The Sun & Moon aren’t always kept separate” as a line of text below the image. Better words can probably be thought of if it’s actually done.
*Original
Epic flash crash
......whut
And once again..need adblock
Awww, what a cutr reqest
@Yavos No, on Windows 7/8 (possibly Vista), you can selectively mute windows (although you do have to mute all Flash players)
Alright but it's a show about ponies and magic and junk I laugh at the fact that genacide is being discussed.
I wanna draw some human pony
So I will do that
I kinda wanna change my nick, but if I do, people might not know who I am...
Man, when I gave my answer to DoctoDoctorWho's question, I didn't realize we were talking about yesterday's episode
11,02Better turn off stream to input this data >>
does your skype work, hurr
Man, if I would have known how, I would have volunteered for this too.
BlaxBlain: The season premire had slavery
I knoooooow
SuperBrony64: just dosconnect a cable no?
DoctoDoctorWho1 In basic. It's a kids show it holds good enough writing to appeal beyond that but reasons and explanations are usually something you'd best not put over say a fantasy world which would never go beyond that. It's mean't to be understandable for children and probably always will be thus we won't see those complex explanations of things and what not. That's just how i see it
BlaxBlain: I think I only used genocide as a joke when Twilight started shooting up the Pinkies
instead of stopping and starting?
DoctoDoctorWho1 yeah, I wanna change my nick too, but peoplöe may not remember me than :(
...or not :s
Lil_B: You could always tell us you are Lil_B after the fact.

13naw sb broadcast your credit card number to the world
@Venusy Still the problem if you have something running in FF with sound you want and then want to mute flash player, it mutes the complete FF
13nothing bad will happen
I'd muck rather be this!
True
11,02Shizuka: Do I input here for free internet stuff?
I think someone should stream L4D2
We're all trustworthy here >_>
I can't believe that Perry is now streaming for almost 22hours /) for that, you're awesome can't say that often enough!
Everlasting_Joy yeah, I know, but still... I tend to think to much about Stuff like that...
13yes start with your SSN
Does sound seem gone for anyone else?
huh? did the sound mute just for me or for you too?
Uh, did it mute for everyone else, or did my headphones just break
Assassin's Creed III!
11,02k
yep gone for me too
Sound died
11,02don't look at my number okay everypony
zombiu? dafaq
indeed
Did perry's audio die?
11,02784-78-1234
I mean, I'd much rather be this!
killerpony7733: We dont need complex explanations for why things work in this universe. But what happens when you get sent back to the pond, is kinda an interesting thing to talk about. ie, its not the magic thats under discussion, its the effects it has on the setting.
13all i see is ***-**-****
13you're fine
perry is back
the whole stream audio died
works again
^
11,02sweet
this is going to be a problem.
audio's on again
it's back
SuperBrony64: That a fake number or you're friend code?
SuperBrony64: Moo :3
technical derpiculties
646.64.6464 I saw it all
At least its close to the end
Rex_Mundi Sure sure. It's fun and really mind puzzling to actually try and make a answer for it. But in the reality the show won't go beyond just saying it's magic it's a legendary place that's it
derpiculties - I like that word. :3
13see like i used to use hunter2 for my password
oh! y6eah alex
Soo getting Oroshi Warriors 3, even though Samurai Warriors 3 on the Wii sucked :(
yeah*
101.50.1337 - Nice number you got there
Whats JJ Drawing?
I take it that that number that ends in 1234 can only be fake, right?
urgh
Rex_Mundi Generally headcanon is complex and really hard to understand. But canon is simple and to the ground with what it is
Lets hope
a horse i think
13but now my password is ***********************************
SuperBrony64 there is an enterely new YouTube Setup, even foir the Wii
killerpony7733: Yeah, I know the show wont answer. But this episode raises the question of "wait, are those characters dead?"
All these numbers, are OVER 9000!
JJ, draw Baj
:D
I think its a pony
Alex, no.
xD
keep that out of here.
no OCs rule anyway
Snowponies on a snow background on a bright day
So since all these awesome artists draw requests for you, why not consider donating? Or how about bidding on that awesome Autographed Taralicious Emblem by ShikariSpeeder http://derpy.me/QwztP ;D
im sooooo curious. what is zombiu?
Anyone have a fan going?
JJ,can you draw queen chrysalis?
So, what's with this this non-allowed Justin Frame
RainbowDashisBestPony - Got it Shizu
2 of the DJs at Everypony did 24 hour DJ sessions
13wat no
that melody....
Zombiu is a zombie game for wiiu :3
13it's viviisbestpony
Rex_Mundi But there i would say they are magically duplicated ponies or cloned if you like. They are only kept in those forms by magic. Ergo magic ponies meaning whatever magical energies they are made of is put back in the pond
13OOPS
@hurrdurr is that an official request?
makes me think of My little Pony
Rex_Mundi Not actual real living and real ponies.
yes
@Yavos How does one tell?
meow
/me goes to google
13Rex_Mundi: well consider this, we see that staring into the mirror pool causes your clone to come up out of it, so the audience is always seeing the prime equestria
@vcrmaster just request it and we add it to the list ;)
13clones can summon more clones from the pool but the camera stays in the main universe
11,02ZOMG UPDATE
oh ok
дфд
thank you yavos
*lal
*Yavos Okay, just curious.
i love none piece
13so twilight sending the pinkies back was literally sending them back to whatever form they were in the pool
well...better change my nickname back to normal
Nintendo is trolling you
There's Pinkie, and then first, second, to nth derivatives of Pinkie are all Pinkie Prime. Calculus saves the day!
there we go
13shana: nice try
Is this for even playing games?
I had to try it :D
Shizuka: so you get notified for failed attempts?
The update I mean
Pinkie Pie is serious buisness.
13eeyup
Everlasting_Joy Eh i watch cartoons for enjoyment not to seriously ponder what this and that happens. Maybe i do participate in a conversation or discussion but i usually never go beyond that making it change what i think.
neat ^_^
Handsome_Jack you loose when you die, and loose everything, to get your Stuff back you Start as a new Person and must find yourself as a Zombi, other than that, you can't pause the game, Menue is on the Pad, the Zombies don't stop
and now JJ can play "guess the requester"
dx/dP Pinkie = nPinkie^n-1
what i dont understand is how a clone creates a clone. its a clone of a clone. wouldnt it be deffective?
Thank you all, I've been around a collective 8 hours and never found this stream dull
shana: what were you trying to do:P
lawl
*Johnny How long has this stream been going?
Everlasting_Joy My common sense just generally says to me it's for children and it's probably gonna be kept at that level and what else.
22 hours
draw scootalo dancing
the time, it flies, i need to shower now
LETS-A GO!
can you donate using paypal on your donate page?
I am here

They're analyzing this not because it's worth analyzing, but because they want attention.
@Bakpony, I believe you can
13Everlasting_Joy: more occam's razor, twilight's sending mirror pinkies back to the mirror universe, and because she never targets the prime pinkie we don't know if the spell would even work on non-mirror ponies
its a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone
Seriously, Bowser needs a hobby.
I don't think that is the case joy
Request: Humanized or just as ponies Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Sitting on a bed with RD comforting Flutters
@bakpony Yes you can, I did
Guys look a video game!
:O How DARE he take the cake!
Just a typical day in the Mushroom Kingdom
OMG Peach is getting kidnapped! What a twist!!!
13it's entirely possible that if twilight were to target pinkie prime with the spell, it wouldn't work at all
Everlasting_Joy Ah but honestly? it's fun and pretty cool to see and listen to it makes you think more but in my case never changes squat on what i know and think of the show
Oh, it's in dollars... that makes it easier :3
moop
13haven't seen fairies in... aaaages
How do you think Lauren faust looks like a Pony?
Shizuka: Twilight mentions that it says in the book that she can accidentally send the real pinkie back
GUYS watch the vidja game already!
yay!
Shizuka: It was one of the first episodes of the show, so... Yeah.
*facepalm*
Ah the airship had little baby Koopaling airships
Tsitra!
There's already a oc from her Herp

Epic start, epic start
XD, YES!
killerpony7733: It's okay to analyze something, even on a strange tangent. What irritates me is that people are analyzing something that doesn't need/deserve analysis. Kind of like pondering what ifs.
Sonic vs Rainbow Dash & Spitfire
Haha he's a coon suiter!
General Request: Rainbow Dash as Sonic! xD
Sonic and Rainbow Dash. Kart/boat/plane racing.
Ah, Fying Squirrel Mario!
Kurra: thats not a coon :)
Wait better request. Sonic, Rainbow Dash & Spitfire in a Delorian from Back to the Future
Hey don't touch that squirrels' nuts
@DeerioJim the auction will only last during that stream
(I've been playing a lot of All-Stars Racing Transformed)
magic is an omnipotent, semi-sentient energy form that when applied to the physical universe, has a variety of interesting effects. The source of this energy and the variety of its effects can be applied to an altrenate dimention, reffering to the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th dimentional views. This dimention is effected by sentient thought and emotion and exists outside of the time-space continuom. This allows it to affect this and probably m
Shizuka: The plot of "TMT" is the very same as "Too Many Pinkies" yet I haven't heard people raising alarms at Butch or FoP itself as a promoter of genocide.
@DeerioJim so about 2 hours 15 minutes left to bid
Everlasting_Joy True you should never strain yourself and get really frustated on it. But i consider it healthy however to ask a few when and why and what else.
Yahyah, tanuki.
No king kai stop it!
13Everlasting_Joy: yeah people going OMG TWILIGHT MURDERER are ignoring the mechanic of the pool
@Yacos that is why I wondered if you could change the time. might be no bids because poeple think they got 2 days left
11,02./)3-
LOL
xD
@MMC that would be really cute too
13if you were merely killing the alt pinkies they wouldn't be sent to the pool
2hrs 15, isn't it?
nope, it's not changeable
^
Shizuka: Or just making a stupid joke of the scene
Shizuka: That, all of that.
thats my view on magic.
for the record: Tsitra360 just entered the chat.
@Vensy yes
My little pony is serious buisness!
and on this episode of: That Weird chat
13that they *are* sent to the pool just raises questions of how the pool fits into the cosmology of equestria
Keep donating everyone!
Cheese n Rice LET IT GO!
Ponies: Serious Business
i will soon
first i need to think of a request
atleast twilight wasnt the one to try and clone herself. that would be a disaster
well, i suspected that her magic might not even work on the real pinkie, but it still was somewhat disturbing how she killed them all off, they were alive after all.unless theyre a part of some collective magical consciosness of the pool or something, then i guess they would not die
when the pool appeared I said "Yay, more magical locations for FanFic writers!"
13hey if star wars geeks can have the gravitational constant for planets not even featured in the films, we can debate multiverse mechanics in mlp
CRYSTALS BE DOOP, SHOOP SHOOP BE CRYSTALS
@JJ I am happy Princess Molestia came back up. You are the reason I really got into Ponies.
There's a place in Uganda and a Con in the balance. Donate!
i'll always try for nightmare moon
You power up only loose it two seconds later classic
Lil_B: and many pics of twilight zapping the wrong pinkie :D
Shizuka, it's nanoscopic black holes through which only the properties of mass, charge, and spin are retained! @_@
Man what a happy go lucky game he is playing we should start talking about it
In think the gravitational constant appeared in Star Trek Oo
I personally like the idea of a Multiverse mechanic...but I'm trying to weatch Mario, so....
it did!

Parasprite and Tribble Match!
And it was slightly altered by using a hyperextended warp field.
Id like to think the clone pinkies werent really sentiant, because otherwise things start to get horrible...
oh mario is it the one with all the coins

So here is a question, do mushrooms make mario normal size and getting damage shrinks him. Or is small mario is normal size and mushrooms make him giant?
Rex_Mundi normal is without the mushroom
Rex_Mundi: Small sized Mario is the normal size.
win
Rex_Mundi i thought they made him giant
22h of perry, THAT's awesome
the mario with the mushroom is "Super-Mario"
It makes the world smaller.. Magic

Is Tsitra in the call?
1 and 3 are good.
middle bloxk
middle one!
well in super mario kart they give you a boost
I grew up on both Mario and Popeye and figured that Mario's relationship with Mushrooms is similar to Popeye's relationship with Spinach.
@bakpony added
Yes, he is in the call
this eyup aria
I seriously
cannot
Imagine a game where Bowser is Kidnapped and the player has to save him from Peach.
King_Kai: Trapped with what?

It's about to get a whole lot frostier in here.

King_Kai: Are you sure you're using the correct comand?
King_Kai: Try refeshing the stream and put in your other name?
thank you yavos :)
Caramel_Colours yes he is
Can anybody mind telling Tsitra that I put my request that he did for me as my Home screen on my phone? That would make him happy if somebody would tell him. :)

King_Kai: I meant refresh chat not the stream
xsplit is the way to go for twitch.
somehow my nick is in use without me being there, interesting.
ugh
Speaking about me.? XD
So did I understand that right? The new Galacon location is already set?
And I still get pinged from King_Kai
Interesting...
the music that plays when the red coins appear is exacly like the music in Yoshi's Island
same thing happened to me last night DoctoDoctorWho
how are you supposed to find out that the hidden passage is there first playthrough
I wonder if Extra lives are as pointless as they are in Galaxey, Sunchine, and 64
coins leading the way alexxm
For a month by now - yes
i've read it will be in a huge castle near stuttgart
No :I
alexxm search everywhere... and probably not on the first Playthrough anyway :Ü
Rex_Mundi: Galaxy wasnt that bad,
It's next to a castle
That's bone chilling
Not IN the castle
Reading helps, haha
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Jastrian - I'll Fly / Crystal Uprising / A Dash of Failure

we are enough people
I doze off and then I hear people talk about eggs and pouches
All the funfunfun would trash the castle.

But alot easier
Didn't someone request Twilight Vs. Siri?
*looks at new EqD post... metal core?... ew
Kandarihu that's the Point
SuperBrony64: Sonic next?
aren't you tired perry?
Hey SB what's your 3ds friend code?
Perrydotto: how are you still awake?!!
Nintendo tries to make new Mario Games "Sunshine, Galaxy" and with the "New Super Mario Bros"-Games they wanna please people who want the Sidescroller Mario back
hello, fesoferbex
I'm ok with that future
welcome back
@Tom yes, someone requested that
i'm back for a 3rd time
but not everyone gets that, what results in a lot of hate for the New Super Mario Bros games :/
this future sucks, where the hell is my jetpack?
The problem is they don't give anything fresh
Lil_B, I see. But I'd still expect some originality in the side-scrolling aspect of NSMB.
they haven't for a little while now
i should be more active in the german community
I think I'm the olny person who actually liked Sunshine
only*
YokusaHHart: Nope.
I liked sunshine
I love sunshine
Someone is talking bad about Sunshine?
YokusaHHart, no you aren't. I enjoyed it too
@Tomtortoise to be exact, it was LotrPony
I LOVE LOVE sunshine
yay! :)
YokusaHHart, I love sunshine
sunshine had some nice twist
@Bakpony you should (I should too xD)
CrystalPhoenix that's the point, they try with new Powerups and new modes, but they can't change the generall Syle
What I disliked, was Peaches voice that stuck with all the games afterward.
I could be more active, period
Tsitra got his mike working?
hey everypony, I'm back
mic*
1001 EUROS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
