nuuuuuuu
Lol
"it's blue"
saddest fight ever....
I don't, haha
You only got through the first act
that's everything you can tell from an indepth analysis
:P
I just can't get into it
most brutal fight ever
Seriously, it's like they originally wrote Shinji as a woman and changed his gender at the last minute considering how immasuline he is
You know how you have a friend that shows you a movie
I didn't even get through the first act
maybe shinji was made for the yaoi fangirls
or even most of the way through it
whoa arm wtf?
00,10oh just wait
And through the whole movie, he keeps saying that
OH THAT'S CHEATING
Well this is nothing like that
wow
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
ok, cause i didnt get it
dat was unexpected
ew
I seriously just don't have the time or attention span to sit through all that
THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY
I tried twice
the second time I got a little farther
How far?
Aaaaand without audio it looks like Shinji grew gills
there wasn't even a story yet
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME MASCULINE, THAT IS NOT PART OF MY JOB
oh yes we can
I had to find objects around the armless guy's house
Yea

00,10assuming direct controll
Umm
You can skip that you know
:'(
really?
Now if only EVA-03 was equipped with the dummy plug.
oh boy
...Please tell me Shinji didn't grow gills

You can go to the next part at any time you want
which would be required for hd stream.
By the looks of it...

and perfectly fitting music too
Pretentious soundtract time!

Oh

The first six minutes manages to make even less sense.
I never did understand this series much
Yes, that's possible.
Is it like six minutes of DBZ where it's the main charactors yelling?
Er is the third movie going to be shown?
Am I reading that right?
shinji is voiced by a woman oO
Third movie's not out in good quality yet. Only a six minute clip of it.

The best magic tricks are those done with diversion, in my opinion. That is, when you distract the audience for just a second because you can only focus on one thing at a time.

HI EVERYPONY:)
Normally.
Hello, caps-crazy.
Magic though? I always feel like a total dummy.
It's easier to trick you into looking somewhere else then it is to hide something from you though.

i got pinged
No idea.
there was just an argument on spyroforum about that movie
And the more that you know, then the more you can grow, then the more loopholes where the law can go
Clock-la said the dragons were ugly
and that she didn't like it
....15?

Lol
Well.
he looks kinda younger
like 13
http://i.imgur.com/2AELG.jpg
12 maybe
"It keeps him out the way, I guess."
Hah.
I look older than him.
I dont get it
My face decides to spam freckles everywhere.
I liked the movie, but you do have to admit the dragons are pretty ugly
I look forward to seeing this kid.

That was good stage performance.

I'm impressed
I think I know how it works, but I won't tell.
Not too bad.
Tell me kammer
Ok, for a little kid, he knows too much. We need to make sure he does not multiply.
NOAW

She's got a lisp.

Sexual diversion.
It sure is some trick, but I don't wanna know
Ahahahahahaha
LOL
I don't really like that show...
because she became one and they didn't get to
lol
I appreciate how they don't reveal the way it works.
Do they still use the forums?
Nah
no
It leaves the whole thing a mystery.
^
Hail came back a few years later with a different name
But she didn't post much

dafuk?
not really a magic trick
^
id like to see the letters that were on the board
Housey isn't exactly a common word. XD
Color me impressed
HAAAAAAAAAX
he's hacking the world
He's a time lord
I'm sure
He must've wrote that up during the event somehow....
It is all in the confusion from the begining.
http://i.imgur.com/NIqGI.jpg
Oh.. please no..
By the way, evenin' y'all~
The "housey" thing is the really clever bit.

Time machine
lol
Huh.
uh oh
nice.
Wow.
:O Wow!
:P
DID SOMEONE CALL HIS NAME?
Good for him!
He got 'em.
He teleported it.
inb4 he's a time lord
he used a different trick
He wrote with his heel
not bad
maybe he can write with his toes?
Umm... am I seeing somethng in the stream?
Dat Rarity.
Well, he said that he didn't write it.
He had to have written the prediction during the event, but that's just about all I can reason out.
brb
I see a image....
and folded it up?
wat da fek rarity?
He be back
Sword! Give me sight! beyond sight!
Teller produced a grand total of 2401 coins.
4

pound? this is a UK show?
yes
Java: It sure is.
I'd like to see some of them street magicians seen in TV, in that show
wpw
wow
lawl dat commercial skip
Since it's Las Vegas I thought it's an US show
051 more ep after this than more drawing
05this is basically my break
I dunno, I'm stumped how he concealed all of that.
back
lol
To write down the answers without ANYONE noticing for all of that time?
That alone is clever.
sleigh of hand.
Bex?
he has a COD perk
maybe someone Did notice,they dont ask the audience
Our eyes see everything, but our brains only focus on one thing at a time.
I would not dare being on first row in a magic show
I would be hexed
And he didn't use his pocket apparently either.
maybe he has some mechanism under his suit with string that writes depending on how he moved his arm
or his leg
or any part really
Why use mechanical deception when you can hide things in plain sight?
why does he have concrete in his head?
haha
Why not
dammit
lol
haters gonna hate
or that might be part of the illusion
whoa!
xD
Diverting attention is basically the essence of illusion

Hah, yeah

05from this pocket

Hrm, maybe
that explains the knocking
we need to watch another noaw
spamming it everywhere won't make people join

I think that a simple trick which looks really amazing is the best kind really.
Penn and Teller have a history of revealing how their tricks are done, pisses off the magic circle but it's really interesting.

BURN EVERYPONY
I mean really, it's half past 4 AM, go to bread.
how many users?
burn everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
going to bread?
ok then
It would support as many users as you throw at it.
/me dives into bread

The most we get is on pony eps, which is around 5000+
http://i.imgur.com/xIsI4.jpg if you laugh you are going to hell...nah
Hmm..
wow
Somewhere around 7000 I think
Hrm
He guided him to the word?
just have everyone donate 10 cents and that would cover all the equipment... :P
XD
yeah that is common though i didnt see how he guided him
Hrm, that's interesting though. How'd he guide him to that specific word....?
I could probably make it work.
We don't take donations, people are scared of C&D
05id think of a word like invonurability
ohhh, that's a good point

Literally, I have the flu from babies
05less images thank you

05btw stream is sending at an uplaod rate of 2mbps
SOO MUCH LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
boo
:O
not bad
uh....
It is!
13less dancing more clothing change
yeah it works out to about a cent a user to watch 1080p for 23 minutes.
:)
Teller's looking kind of not indifferent.
Damn
Wow
Less clothing, more dancing!
WAT
I've seen this a couple times...still no idea how they do it
2mbps... that's bad by Swedish standards, isn't it?
Teller is the not known giver of fucks
wow
which actually adds up.
Dat Queen cover.
05depends
Yeah
for both of them
lawlwut
$70 for 7000 users
05how many are watchign stream?
wow
bandwidth isnt cheap.

heh
lawl
Not lagging at all for me.
stream is fine for me.
Not lagging for me either.
not lagging here
whcih is $0.05 a gb if i remember right
for me it is ;_;
05it uploading at 2mbps means theres jsut that much data going up
1369 on now
986 and 148.
would that cover it?
fer me it's lagin like crzy, is it because I'm a murican? :(

Tear-away clothing.
I'd look up at my logs
05gets to play at their las vegas stage
/me nods.
I'd have to ask the ep streamer
Did make a nice performance though.
but the window got cleared after I parted :P
And they disguised the removal well.
We all stream at different bitrates
720 is about 40% cheaper
05omg these eps are 50 minute each
BUT remember this
05with no commercial
.-.
O.o
I can make it also support streaming to ipad/iphone/android which is nice
Nice.

yes it is:D
I like the idea of streaming to mobile devices.
Noone streams 1080p right now.
I'd say it would be EQD worthy
At least, as far as Twitch.tv is concerned.

Manliest way to shave, Legos

teller liked that one
mind blown
Kind of.
Teller has his pen out, though, I think Teller has an idea.
Teller: not bad
/me claps because cool
...
george shittler?
hey
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878203648/h3BC868B4/

I'm still amazed he slipped a wrapped deck of cards in between his hands.
uh
hi?
Without him catching it.
lol
:D
Highlight spam much?
Told ya
YES
The best part is left undiscovered.
Off to Vegas with you!
Hoho.
TAKE MAI MONEH
That's ballsy enough to bring Penn up close too.
Meth does this all the time
Jaysus!
but he thought he can do that
I have an idea
Yea?
Okay, yeah, that was really impressive.
It's basically. 'We know everything you did! Everything! except... the important bit."
when you spam like that we should just not say anything
yeah
:P
dat ;)
To be fair I didn't say anything
hm... Scarface?
:P
dari wins
lol :p
Kidding.
/me looks at me
congratulations, you win a trophy
I WIN
lol, Scarface

Anyone here like Rap?
That's all folks!
Not really, sorry
No.

And no one knows where the staples came from. They some how hit them in the back of the head.
oh
Anyone here like Reggae?
Oh dear.

hmm its easy, there wasonly three staleps in the gun.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You stapled my father. Prepare to die.
I like 80s and country music
inb4 he fakes the pain
ded
J-pop.
13hm..
Oh
y we clap?
that's kind of... interesting
05ive done that
I also like J-pop
05but into my thumb
He's got a way to tell which one is loaded, beyond the weight.
nah he just seems liek a comedian :D
I believe you have my stapler.
kind of a guilty pleasure
not really getting anything here
hhahaa
theyre all loaded but they have safeties
Hah, parental guidance.
cuban staplette
and then he died
13russian roulette doesn't seem much like a magic trick as it is having safeties
Japanese Pop
I explained this before lol
XD
I'm dying!
13canary we should burn the building down
wait, are those staplers or nail guns?
oh yeah.
hahaha
I heard some JMetal, pretty good

Because I have to fix my desktop
ded
ded
oh it's okay
Seriously, arrows get lost like you don't even know.
:P
hmm the gun was amrked thats why he placed it to the side
staple guns are not the best medium for a magic trick
Okay that was dum
and she has her gender on the forum set to male
Nice performance but boring.
Very nice.
lol
why?
I didn't like it
Meth: thats a good idea
:D
yup :p
HA
XD
lol
he stretch it a little bit too much.
I'm blatantly a girl
XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD
LOL dari
He's got a way to tell which one's loaded.
:P
NEVER!!
13yeah i think you could easily have a tell on the loaded stapler and just modify the trick realtime
i'm closer to 2013 than most of you :P
muhahahhaa
Hey
Oh
since we're talking about genders
only 25 hours :3
LOL
Yeah.
to see if he remembers
:P

You wanna quiz me?

Lies already. NO-ONE goes to England for the food.

Do not ask me Meth's gender though

The trick is that the stream was stopped the entire evening.
can you quiz me on something?
Phew. There we go.
:)
and we're basck
and it's back again. MAGIC
Here's a quiz
The real trick is that the stream has been off all day.

just go through the nick list and guess everyone's genders
We just think we're watching this.
>:3
Including ChanServ
I'm going afk till 8:30pm

Didn't t-mobile merge with someone else?
Unfortunately

T-mobile doesn't work well in my area
My cousins have diabetes.
Always trying to stab me with their pokers.

Get in the Van
That was nifty.
hes the dairy queen.
13is fine just refresh until you're fine
i have sound

I don't know
You only do it 400 times a minute
dont tell him
he has to leave and come back
to change his name
hahahahahah
KEEP HIM OUT
he actually did it
Actually, I got an idea
I didn't mean for him to actually leave
Play along :P
:o
lolololol
don't do that
aw
Sorry, he's not here
really now?
FUUUUUUU
haha
But loved at the same time for 1080p./
Nah, you need to cut to G3.5 halfway through the ep
if you enter the captcha wrong
cup*
Because you lied!
LOL
don't trust the friench
lies
Good for him
How difficult would it be to p2p stream a movie?
okay this is confusing without my usual colored nicklist
/whois meth
if you enter it wrong it starts playing from the beginning.
If you don't speak their crazy moon language, don't trust them
I am Meth.
er.. I mean.. oh watevr.
I'm guessing they have to reveal the nature of their trick after the show to verify it.
XD
G'night everypony! :)
eets eempossbl
yeah, Kimori's right
And then the Queen had him burned on the stake.
Wait, that meth, or me?
impersonating = bad
do not impersonate
how do I change my nick faster?
Greetings Everypony
without leaving?
You can't
It's a special ability
yes u can
...
u did
oh
RDX and I impersonated each other once
Given to only the highest of the order
that was fun
FAAAAAAAAAKE
he is gona burn paper in a vacuum
Has Teller EVER talked?
we just made fun of each other
and no one even caught on
O_O
my client claims that someone pinged me
grab a random ponce
/me is unable to locate this ping
man, this reminds me of that time i won a years supply of lo'real kids shampoo from a rugrat's play
payable to me of course
he grabed his best france
Can you peer to peer stream a movie?
cause i had the winning ticket under my seat
NAAAAAAAAAIL
I think Penn and Teller also review their showmanship skill.
is it wrong to be upset by some drawing that feature someone holding a violin with the right hand?
i like his hair
i leik his mane :3
:P
I felt bad leaving him out
just don't make me regret this :P
Well
O_o
thx
I've never seen a violinist holding the violin with his right hand
never ever ever
sukker
Some people play play guitar differently too.
ok
Chicago is the greatest destination
Viewers?
yeah
Woah, that's a helluva audience participation
we can also set a mode that prevents non-ops from changing their nicks
or was i right?
:o
Jim- watch
oh
this guys got a lot of charisma
i was wrong lol
wow
Hrm.
Hahaha
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6824324864/h42D7C563/
WITCH CRAFT BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
transsexual.
that wouldn't make sense
He's doing this all off-stage? This is pretty impressive actually.
quit saying my name stream
ffs
they were probably messing with you
he changed it
as a joke
:o
Or Ross.
Whichever.
Barbetos_Jonathon
I used to call him that and he would get mad at me
It did it again
oh
Majority are probably American SR
EVIL EVILLLLL....
does not seem legit
13well i dunno about forcing the tshirt but the numbers could just be math
Ponies live stream, after 5 minutes it tells you to pay $2. :P
Lawl
wut?
that's just cruel
suddenly Nirvana
NIRVANA
the XD
kanye west?
Nirvana awesome
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
wait
it takes long enough to find the episodes as it is
whoa
.......
Hahaha!
I still think you should cut to G3.5 half way through the ep
:P
:o NIRVANA
hmm?
Amazing!
WTF
:P
lol
wut
Wait.
O_O
Awesome

AMAZING
lel
Now that's SHOWMANSHIP!
whaaaaaaaaat!
OK... that was BRILLIANT.
And of course, Teller still isn't impressed.
13the numbers in the bowl do not match his
didn't he choose his own destination though?
thats a high-quality mask
whoever spotted the hands was on to something
nonetheless: MIND = BLOWN
REPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAY
This infrastructure would allow you to host and stream everything all episodes on demand
why nirvana
but it might get expensive if you got a lot of traffic
I WANT TO REPLAY
Hah
i mean its good but still
haha
lol
Wait, would you be gaining money if u livestream?
Let's have another look on that
13ah thus the sunglasses

Oh!

Not bingo.

AMAZING!!
thanks

the tension!
tense
The sound of silence.
Let them bite
._.
O_O
nomnomnom
Well
It's easier to get rid of them when they think there's a meal
yum...?
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Teller doesn't talk.
Don't be mean.
O_o
lol
13dat grin
like a frog
this trick is really a nail biter
yummy needles
I have seen this before
LORD.
D:
:O
13they're falling into his collar
Ugh. ._.
O_o
This trick is kinda hard to swallow...
13Quick_Thinker: no just doesn't really talk to people other than penn
It may sound weird, but it's the best way to kill them
are those spikes even real?
I don't see the point of this trick
Yep
Which I think in itself is amazing.
I can't stomach this trick!
C'mon Teller
don't choke
O_o
Well you can either deal with it for a week
the trick is, theyre made of crackers!
Or wait a month and deal with it for a couple more weeks
Ad....why?....
xD
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAHAHAAA
They go into hibernation if they can't find food

Hehehee
Some news on the gaming front

Well, at least Teller isn't scared of going to the dentist.

....no
No way.
INB4 needles.
Lol
I prefer Torchlight.
SANVICH!

Okay folks! Thats all!

Suddenly baby applejacl
I don't even have the first clue.
well time for riftraxx

Well, the fact that he never speaks might help him in that one
This stream is already awesome
That was fun.
...
PONY
WOO
:)
Oh, 720p stream.
O_o
suddenly pony
*o.O
Oh wow, I haven't seen this one yet
DAT 720
anything thouse guys can do I can do also
newest ep?
heh, there's a gay marriage thread now on spyroforum
spike has a foot fetish
I feel like that's kind of asking for disaster
ew
just notied fluttershy walking winona
loves the smell of dirty feet
yeah
but since we are kind of low on traffic
but I'm gonna see where it goes
let it ride.
yeah
:P
thats bad of me to say.
:P
05its a 720p stream
yet you didnt let my campaign thread stay :p
It's just in the spam section
honestly, totally forgot there was an episode this week
I would have let it stay.
I don't delete threads
lol, should I move it back?
Blam.
Faceplant.
Java: That's good
To tell the truth, I disliked the episode. I liked Spike as a character, but this proved him to be a huge tool. Hopefully, they can fix him in a future episode.
yeah
probably not now because it'll be all spammy
Java: that makes sense
Because fate is a cruel mistress.
05try fullscreening
thats the best knot ever made if it can be unknotted when spike its it
Spike can bathe in magma. He wouldn't care.
delete all Meth 's threads.
05id liek soem feedback on that
evening all
hits*
I only have 2 threads
the timberwolves still look too out of place to me
Dat CGI...
see, here it is http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12946-vote-breaking-bad-for-moderator.html
suddenly 3d
The Timberwolves seem to pretty much be golems.
and only 3 times the normal stream data also. very nice
eww 3d
05but i also realize the shitload of work that would go into it
05so i can compeltly understand why they went with it
I like well done 3d work.
Gonna toggle it full screen
^
05but i dont like it
the amount of work is the only reason it doesn't bother me too much
but still
Hahahah "I assure you free furry fans for all!" "isn't that about 80% of the reason deviantART exists?"
oh boy, here we go....
dat hug
They were reduced to using 3D.
yeah those 3d models look too... 3d-ish
:P
WOOKIE LIFEDEBT!
Timber wolves should be a conjuration summon in Skyrim
Well, computer-generated imagery isn't exactly as rough as it used to be.
ya its not like he accidently unknotted it
okay, cool
hopefully it works out
I actually think the 3D was used to pretty good effect.
It does look strange now that you mention it
Woah, wha?
lol
I don't own it
I don't get clumbsy spike.
You all watch ponies?? Eeeeewwww
is ADORABLE
er Applebloom actually
He is fully capable of cleaning Twi's crap.
lol
lol disclaimer on the bottom
and then the pig got dirty again
XD
but we would be their competition
he's too excited
Some compies can't handle 720 at all
THAT is why he's acting up
Well, the thing is that Spike is used to working for a Mane character. Must be strange working for a background pony.
PIES
nah we can work together or something.
anton: Magic. No, srsly, that's the only logical explanation
or tell them to pound sand and do our own thing. either way.
damnit spike
I also think this episode lacked character.
I agree
Or, at least, wrecked spike's character
Any computer than can't handle 1080p is pretty lame.
this episode also lakced being good
You just made that up, didn't you Spike?
Rarity's character was spot on :3
05Bigcheese: its a connection issue
not now
Twilight when she's reading = me when gaming
05internet is veeeery young
Pinkie was the only character that I liked in this ep.
05you cannot expect everyoen to have fast speeds
mhmm
She's like, "Not now Spike, doing books."
lol
mhmm
lol this is my third time watching this today
Spike as a master chef? I'd like to read those!
well that update killed optifine
that poor kitchen
I think I win.
Well, that's a lie, there are some good HiE fics.
"Whatever. I can ask Celestia to send me another slave any time."
Foreeeever
Yeah I don't get very excited about reading HIE fics.
05i liek AJ's faces in this one
the poor pie
Hahaha
HE HAS A BUSINESS CARD
You can give me one of the Domains :p
seriously he HAS A BUSINESS CARD
The only thing I liked in this episode was the stache.
OK, you get "methisdumbdumb.com"
oh Lord
A business card in crayon. XD
I do?
There are several HiE fanfic that actually worth the read.
not the AXE!!!
Can you make it a .edu domain?
maybe
Java: have you read Hands?
yes to Rarity
Ha ha loved Applejack's nonchalance there.
methisdumbdumb.edu
poor Rarity
screen
I need to find a way to monetize the stream
Yep
interesting
Arrow 18. Read that. HiE, but differnt and believea ble.
and we KNOW SPike can bake
i bet applejack is enjoying this part
at least the worst horse has to eat bad pie
only good HiE fic I know of is the voltaire one
lol
I bet Applejack enjoyed that.
05a good HiE is TTEOAP
She doesn't seem fond of Rarity.
the fanfics are being writen as we speak
lol
Title it "Big Ponies Vol. 1"
05i dont like many fics
Odd
05the ocne i can manage to read are crossovers
If Rarity doesn't know Spike likes her, she is dumber than derpy
05prefferably sci fi
OK wtf... http://i.imgur.com/bTSGY.gif
of course rarity would like an assistant
Oh Rarity <3

wait
self-insert fics are now canon.

Two family records in a row? That's a record!
and you can all watch it and see if it works
steampunk is still bleh
steampunk is cool
I'm Finally Back!
BUt yeah, they shouldn't have wrecked spike in this episode.
I'm gonna write a comic now. Rarity takes out a restraining order against Rainbow Dash.
peeping in
or wahtever.
Within 50 feet of her residence.

Java: No, but it talks about it.
and RD had to go back to the hospital
ded
Fics need more peeping Rainbow.
05spiek sure can handle the mares~

Why exactly does Spike have a sudden obsession with work?
Inflation is now canon
found it, paranoid android by radiohead
Panic

...
STOP THAT ANIMATORS STOP IT!
/me shudders
OCD
Hah Twi's OCPD.
LOL
apparently
I worried about Twilight
's OCD
the easiest way to break twilights focus
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
FFS I need to upgrade my TV package to get the Hub in HD
OCPD - Obsessive Compulsive Pony Disorder :$
I remember stumble upon an inflation fanfic for ponies on FFnet. It's... weird.
I'm listening to music on my apple tv
knock over the ink holder thingy
counting blades of grass
best parte
Hahaha
isk whats it called
lol dat Pinkie
idk*
heheheheh
:)
pinkie*
what....an elaborate plan pinkie
Yeah Spike is accustomed to Twilight's OCPD.
mmmmustache
YES
Dammit let her wear the moustache!
Pinkie looks actually pretty good with the mustache
Rarity is the only good part of this episode.
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER SEALAB 2021?
pinkie's mustache of evil
I think many ponies are good in this.
Rarityyyy <3
Yes
Is that the first time Twilight teleported where the camera didn't follow her?
Epic part :D
lol
Bad acting :)
Hoooooo
At least this scene is full of originality. Reminds me of Season 1 a bit. :)
RD can be a VA
Just never really watched it properly.
1080p pony stream
Isn't that a weird thought?

That's bad and you should feel bad!
:O
Well, looks like Spike didn't got Fooled. No Vegas for you, Applejack>_>
Poor acting ruins the day
But yeah, another thing I hate about this episode is how they make Spike stupid
Rainbow Dash is best metal growling pony.

Is it me or was that 'ow' undeniably unbrearably cute?

NFSU and NFSU2
One of best games in NFS history.
05love this solo
Damn it.... now I feel like I have to draw...
I rarely play NFS games. I was playing Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero.
Underground 1 had the Honda S2000 and the Integra I think
Can we import images from outside sources?
08,01and then my computer exploded
I liked the old hot pursuit :<
Saturn, Bang
Yeha
Does anyone else have constantly pot-smoking neighbours?
08,01i wish i could go there for realsies and be some kind of rich merchant
08,01P0N3: my neighbours do
Isn't it a pain?
08,01P0N3: i don't know, i've never asked them
Sometimes I come home, and my home is just full of pot reek.
http://www.fdwallpapers.com/games/images/nfs_underground2.jpg
08,01P0N3: suggestion: get some pot yourself, then you won't care.
SUVs have their own races with SUVs only
:p
Image borked
Lol. There's an idea. But no, I'm a grownup... I don't smoke pot any more.
08,01how old are you?
I just drink like all the other old ladies.:P
?
He failed intensive math
He smoked pot
He raped me once
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Celestia Radio's Top 100 Music Countdown
I like this version of this song
08,01ah, in that case, you're in that age range between when it's okay to smoke pot because you're young and stupid, and when it's okay to smoke pot because you're old and wise
08,01or in pain
Well I sure feel old sometimes.
Y'all and youre drugs....bleh.
08,01are you past Logan's Run age?
Now 30 is considered old :(
i leave for 5 seconds...i come back to "he raped me once"....nice
bleh
08,01if not, you have nothing to be worried about
I can't wait to be old. THen you get all the good drugs legally.
I'm 17 and feel old :I
He listened to Slipknot and his favorite movie was Saw II
I apologize Saturn.
does anyone know the band name?
Sorry he raped you, that's not cool.
in the cafe
/me yawns.
He was caught by an officer
Well Java I imagine you do until they kick in.
Depends on my own funds
I'm surprised we don't see more geriatric streaking.
When I have my old-age meds, I might.
He is now sentenced to 15 years of prison, starting Dec. 5th
08,01P0N3: you and me both
O_o
I have to take anti-psychosis pills :<
I think it's time for me to head to sleep.
Justice is served.
I'll be like one of the golden-girls, except less well adjusted and listening to dubstep.:D
08,01*yelling
08,01i jsut hope he never find 4chan
That's not beinga gamer, Saturn. That's being a kid again.
My high school suck. My college tears are fun
years
:o
Saturn, That's freaking awesome
the dirve or the floppy? ;)
Raver, muggers sometimes underestimate old folks with hilarious results.
Which eventually evolved into the CD
08,01but yeah, i don't think it's his thing
And a lot of the old ladies can fight too.
old ladies mud wrestling?
08,01i didn't tell him that it was pretty much mostly gay sex.
Wow. That would sure be a thing to see, Java.
You would never unsee that.
lel
08,01Java: i've seen that
08,01it was hilarious
haahahahahaha
08,01daftest bunch of old ladies i've ever met
Pony Thread Simulators
They would fight together naked or something.
O_o
08,01pretty much, yeah
socker ad
08,01muscly.
lol
08,01*muscley.
u spelled it rite before
08,01oh, okay
08,01P0N3: yeah, not that kind
08,01but i've seen plenty of hot greeks
08,01mostly in my mind.
When I saw a pony thread simulator, I heard the disgusting things people said
05now imgagine all of her liek that
I admittedly haven't seen many Greeks, that I know of.
08,01speeking of hot greeks
05hello there saturn
Harry Potter?
08,01er, i mean, Pony Thread Simulator (PTS)?
I wont bother with a link during stream
Anyway, people talk about topics
Woah! Woah
and they say dumb shit that is also hilarious
^
Moving onnnnnnn
I cant
Ill be kicked
13:P
How about..... uh....games?
Games are fun
but can't join
I want Forza 4...
05:o
I feel like I just missed something important
it is
08,01of course you're considered hot
Nothing too important.
and i am
Hmm?
I'm not hot, I'm 'cute'. I HATE being cute.
I want a pet parakeet.
It's like being hot but without getting any respect.
08,01you're like this hot, cute little Thor
08,01with glasses
O_o
Saturn, pics?
08,01GabeMoist: i actually do have some somewhere
O_o
13sec i'll get you the mediafire link to my multimc instance
>almost
I can't tell.
multimc ?
Either you're hot or you're not
08,01P0N3: quite a broad sweep there
That doesn't mean he wants to do him.
kk
Actually I think they're Armenian. Or Israeli.
Indonesia
Oh cool. How are things there?
Indianapolis
Good mostly, but the petroleum price are problematic
America: Easy, take it from Saudi Arabia
woo another floridian
I stand by Israeli. Pretty sure.
I don't understand the language, but pretty sure about the accent.
I was a Floridian for 17 years, sooo, I stil consider myself one :3
08,01i really want to go and visit Damascus
And honestly, most of the regions of the world have brown people. Caucasians are a minority.
G'night folks!
08,01but... i don't want to be killed
05bronies can appreciate this song
Been in NY for 1 yeah and a half now tho
05shoot her to the moon
Saturn: Don't worry to much. It's not like everyone want to shoot every visitors
life*
Crime in the US is worse usually.
This is why I don't live on the mainland.
Let's all move to Greenland!
08,01Java: i suppose it helps that i am actually brown
08,01or at least, i'm brown until i open my mouth
Lol
05brown mute
05with sunglasses
Thru Russia?
From all over the world, I guess.
I see
And it trickles into the US through our leaky border.
Maybe TSA is getting problematic.
Hey, TSA actually helpful for once?
Plus all this Canadian pot.
It's our largest crop next to wheat.
08,01i don't think it would be a good idea for me to go there
Saturn: Go to Bali (lol self promotion)
You don't want to go to GreenLand? Well, is it gonna be Antarctica or Easter Island?
Saturn: What's you main import to Syria then?
o_o
Kilts?
Awwwww
/me hug Saturn
08,01what's hollowpoint used for?
I want a kilt....
percing skin
THey're bullets that blow up!
08,01get a kilt, then
And blow chunks out of things!
/me 08,01hugs Java back
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096
Hahaha
If you got it, flaunt it! :D
08,01bitch, i just know you didn't post a non-image link during a stream.
Hollowpoint bullets shatter.
05there you go saturn
05check stream
Hollowpoint hurt more.
:(
Saturn - the gist of a hollowpoint is that it turns into shrapnel once it enters the body
hollow point rounds fragment on hit causing considerably more organ damage than normal slugs
I hate hollowpoint.
08,01okay...
too cruel
I always thought it was to peirce skin all the time :P
08,01that's quite nasty
I'm afraid Saturn hates me
08,01so basically, hollowpoint is the "you're fucked now, laddie" round.
basically
Yup
05its very effective agaistn unarmored targest
05ts*
Unless you're wearing kevlar.
08,01berberborscing: i don't hate you, i just hate that you're disregarding our rules
hello guys
08,01pony64: and girls?
05anotehr example
they'll make a nice clean hole
052nd is hollowpoint
Java, there are some .50 bullets that can make a pretty neat hole in armour plate.
Hello everyone
hello
I know, but direct hit. Not angled hit.
Yeah.
Some sort of ceramic composite I think.
http://images.wikia.com/battlefordreamislandfanfiction/images/f/f3/Book.png
Most tanks nowadays are angled to deflect bullets.
armours
well taht's a given
the armor is designed that way to deflect and absorb, common design really
Hee hee remember those gimmickey corner-shots?
anyway where is RX when you need him?
Revolver Ocelot?
05who?
only rx i know is Mazda RX7 AND 8
Oh, why hello there everybody.

That scene with the book was just sad.
When she found the info on the alicorn amulet.
And EVERYONE just ignored her.

Camoflage is SUPPOSED to be drab, Rarity. That's the point, to not be seen in an environment.
SCP-087 made me cry
daaattt piccccc
Rainbow with a camo hat. Heh.

Mag- oh, no wait...
I dunno, I'm sure you could come up with ways.
Yeah, we haven't really seen the military defenses of Equestria much... aside from some stoic guards led by a Unicorn who's really good at force fields.
SLIDE! SLIIDE!

Aw, i skipped

Might be a good idea.
His helmet has "Sleepwalking Bizkit" painted on it.
well he cant just post everything
but it was a song
o, song bleh
After the weak and stupid fluffies are thinned out of feral herds and they figure out puffing their cheeks up doesn't scare predators, they start to actually survive.
And slowly evolve.
time to play metroid prime for the interwebz people
Hee hee do they really?
That's cute.
-runs around in circles-
seriously, they puff their fur up and everything, like cats.
sadly they don't hiss.
drowning?
why would they drown
You haven't been around much, have you?

http://atom.smasher.org/error/
oh... wait.. you didn't
Hi everypony! ^_^
heylo
IIRC
I would like to discuss about The Hobbit but I fear I won't gain anything from it at the current moment
also I'm not one that enjoy giving out spoilers
ok yea lets not then
Topgun
aaaaand
I think
yeah
as for ponies.....
can't remember
lol
herg
but as I said, quality of movies have plummetted here
is not here?
like what's done with the episodes kinda
^im liking this idea
Doesn't seem right.
Some movies just need to shine.
that way newer movies can be added to pool
I AM RELEVANT
Also, hai
Yeah and we
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/25252270.jpg
hello
we'll get the same movies over and over again
Ooh. Fiery.
there's tons of movies out there
when was the last time a movie from 2011 was shown?
hrm maby just have rules that say: do not use same movie 2 weeks in a row??
we can't put every single movies in a single pool
if admins could agree to something liek that
How there
Admins are lurking. Right now.
no idea just putting it out there
>.> just sayin
Say "YYAAAAEEEHHH" if you are spying on us.
it's called do not use the movie that was shown in the span of 6 months
YEAEAAAH, wait not enouf h's
like hey guys... FLIGHT OF DRAGONS is a cool movie! we should add it to the pool
thats cool
the system is fine
winners should not be able to win again in 6 months
I'm pretty sure a lot of us have different choices
or at least 2 or 3
though I do admit I sense a bit of rigging behind
you guys arnt refering to me are you?
pony64:JRP stop hitting him with a pillow
but still the system is fine without that factor
but
i was just huging
I sense some results are rigged a little bit in people's favor
:<
Use this trout instead!
and that's stopping newer movies from getting shown
nonsense
I crushed a flea in my hand, then i opened my hand. That bastard wasn't even there anymore.
is it illigal to air newish movies here?
HTTYD is 2010
2 years old
yeah
and
newish movies = not out on DVD yet
o ok
To be honest
if its out on DVD it should be okay to be shown
oki

stick to one problem if you want to solve it
ryhme time on accident try
>Windows 8
well I suggested Pirates OST, and I THINK they fixed it, but not sure
Little kids being surgeons. Definitely.
ive herd rumors that its bad which means it MUST be absolutely horrid!
they still decide in the end if the movie is ok to be streamed or not
you're not in power to decide that
it had been released on DVD for over a year
message to Apple:.... fuc i got nothin

was an indie hit last summer
Rabble Rabble
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/05b46c474d1710ac3a9cdaa25d572482.png WORTH IT :D
I don't get it. Is this a reference to some obscure TV show?
Dangit, I hate it when the doors go down
:p
this is bad
sorry

They're not having a nice quiet Heart's Warming ;_;
the episode from last saturday was originally written for derpy, not for spike
hello Bronystates
Euthanized... seriously?
because she was handicapped
never allowed on screen again
yes...
But seriosuly... Euthanized? Isn't that a little dramatic?
right
:P
We're finally past 9>2012
well, here at least
not here
I just think it's silly to put such dramatic terminology on a cartoon character.
Still 10:04 here
still 2012 here :I
:)
She was never alive to begin with!
NO
NOT MISSING A THING
^
I liked the episode, personally. =/

best part of the whole episode
RIP Spike
Unless they make a spike episode sometime in the future that is really good.
Not sure whether to celebrate with 09,00 or 04,12... (jks)
... damnit
no one likes spike
according to the title i mean
I like SPike :<
like in season 1
But yeah, Season 3 was only good with episode 3, 5, 6 and 7. (only my opinion, everypony has different opinions). Season 1 is my fav.
He's just a fax machine esentally
My Favs of S3 have been... mmmm... the wonderbolt erpisode (even if it was kinda shallow) and maybe one bad seed
Even Voyager have at least over 100 crew members.
Season 3, overall, lacks the amazing character each of the Mane 6 displayed in Season 1.
Even Andromeda have robots!
:)
18 here
use the lvl3 laser
I think overall Season 3 work well.
the beam can't break the shield
Also Wonderbolt Academy actually help RD character grew up.
Season 3's only good character is Pinkie, in my opinion. I like how they made her more random.
*real
She was supposed to be, but the way she just got escorded away without a word at the end was rather anticlimatic
Hmm, i enjoyed all but the latest ep, the story just seemed too forced and not quite believeable.
But that was already huge with Baby Applejack don't you agree?
Although the plot was a little rushed.
Although the logic even for a cartoon went out the window for that episode
Alot
HASHTAGyolo
lol

I wanna see another Rarity Episode and see the writers try their hardest to not make it about generosity :P
http://www.mlponline.net/attachments/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-baby-mane-six-gif.2598/
My only gripe with Wonderbolt Academy is that it seems to be retconning the previous episode about RD becoming Scootaloo's stepsister. Later episodes have RD in the cast as if Wonderbolt Academy never happened, or ended differently.
hey guys
Although I have to fault Twilight and friends to being on clouds in the fucking first place
something is wrong
Escape?
There goes the crew
boooo
*did
'
/me chugs another can of soda ' Whooooo! PARTY!"
:P
/me noms on Lil_B's ear :3
No one ever thought of that
Its called being prepared
No one can expect to avoid a sudden tornado
Also couldent fluttershy fucking fly?
I'm considering getting sdomething to eat :/
I swear! Sumica's having MUCH worse luck than I get.
worst start I've ever seen
awesome
Of course not
Java: Missing the fucking point man....
completely

oh, sry
a bit long
dat link
Right....
right
Thats MY POINT
Yeah, because magical reassembling wolves are not scary
FiW http://i.imgur.com/fgG57.jpg
Again..being that high up in the air with no form of protection is suicide
Java, yes, but it's a place where that sort of things should be expected.
Java: Its called being prepared
Also RD admit it was very reckless and dangerous.
It's OVER prepared for something we don't know yet.
Right...because not expecting sompony to pull shit is over prepared
maybe tornado protection would be a good idea at a weather school but not a flight school
i mean it;s not something that you would really expect to happen
It's like saying that we must WALLED EVERY BEACH in Aceh.
Japan got hit with Tsunami a lot
We don't
The same as living on a beach without building a tsunami wall.
Now there are practical ways of preparing for a disaster and impractical ways. A Tsunami wall is entirely impractical. The governments in most tsunami-prone areas have early warning systems to call for an evacuation when they see a tsunami coming. That's reasonable.
Go ahead and wall every beach. Go ahead and put a huge net on every sides of the academy. Go ahead and put animal traps all around forests.
this is hilarious
It isn't hilarious, it's embarassing.

don't have a good feeling for 2013 though
2012....
We didn't have a lot of episodes
was hurt myself ;_;
thinking about bad things to myself
Java: Forgot that one
hope it becomes a habit
LOL
Java: I use ZSNES
My cousin had that for like 5 years before he gave it to me. I've had it for like 15 years.
no cloak for you
you're poor
How about no?
That is really uncalled for
How do I PM people?
While I can understand a mental punishment, why even bother smashing something that is pretty valuable?
Sell a SNES for alot, rofl.
Java, /msg <target> <message>
Java: I've played it before.
bl2 tiem
Well smashing a console just to punish someone is not called for
Ooh Borderlands 2?
Take the damn thing away not wreck it
Oh hai luna
Awake at 6 AM here...what is wrong with me
Awake at 6 AM?
That won't do.
My school needs me before 7

I know Mouse 1-3
But I dont use those mice that are like
8 different buttons
http://i.imgur.com/jHh8V.png
Mouse 4 lyfe
lool
Why would a mouse have 8 buttons?
You only neeed 3...
For MMORPG purposes.
^
I play wow with a three button mouse and I dont have a issue
To others it is easier.
Well 8 buttons seems like overkill
Is this Borderlands 2? :I
Yep

Hello, Spell-o-Gaming

A LOT of time.
I edit mostly anime pages, though.

Maybe earlier
You're old.

Damn it, I really need to stop that and OMFG ALTAVISTA.
That was last time
But you still in this streaming site, it means it's not that bad.

I downloaded wow in about 4 hours I think
And WoW is like 22 GB
meh
Wurld urf WurlCrooft
Bitch, you best not be dissing pandas.
I think WOW is popular because it can run on old PCs.
Not everyone build high end PCs.
"just you know why...."
Only MMO I play is Fantasy Online, which is a simplistic Flash-based MMO.
And even then I only play it for an hour at a time, at most.
Wut.
Lol.
Welp.
That answers that.
/me LOVES old shooters.
Play WoW all day ery day

And their reaction is priceless.
Java: dun

Only the nose and mouth can be detected
Welp
Is that another script? ( ° ͜ʖ °)

Man handsome Jack is cruel
Sound?
No, you can do it without the nose and mouth.'
ʖ the nose
i'm not foal
but i like making you laugh anyway :)
Luna's scream is... unsettling
hahahaha
(oʖo)
The nose looks like a retarded 3.
and here
Because it's an annoying-as-all-fuck forced meme with no meaning.
Do you know the difference between kickable and bannable?
meh, pony also bannable at 4chan
not anymore
oh already

They have a board for us (but it has been taken over by idiots anyway).
Check out the board for cringe-worthy posts.
It's rare that's there's actual discussion, but it can also turn into a shithole.
I avoid 4c. But when I went there I always check Photography. There's actual discussion to be had.... sometimes.

How is everypony?
when you got bigger balls on size this @
And yet noone says anything to Adventure Time, despite being for kids and showing way worse imagery
You want to know why aliens havent invaded yet? because they take ONE look at us and turn RIGHT AROUND AND LEAVE
till then... we are an unorganised minority.
