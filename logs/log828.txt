Shizuka: why you being mean?

hi AdamTheDuck jcelios
So...
Errr Sumica ....
00,10behold a rainboom
delicious chekovs soup
Sumica: No reaction to "Hai father?"
Giants won, but no playoff spot...:(
yeah, thats where they make their money, the toys and licencing.
dafuq is that?
In other words, people should charge shows 20 cents rather than $3 on iTunes?
it looks like a 60 vinyl record
wtf is that
wut is that ?
happy days
Verdant_Wasp: second impact
I dont buy from itunes because their prices are stupid.
00,10that was second impact
Exactly
SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME
it looks... different
for tv shows and movies.
13gendo and fuyutsuki got high up there
TV shows and movies are too expensive nowadays
Why did NOTHING happen when "IS that a man on the moon that just said "hi father"...
Vordox - at the heart of it, live the Fonz
I would buy mlp from itunes though if it was availale in canada.
Must me nothing important
BLOOD OCEAN
If they made them $1 instead of 3 I'd probably buy a few
hi all!
very metal
brutal
I mean, it's 22 minutes
\m/
Hello Michael
I wonder how many drops of blood are in this blood ocean...
00,10second impact= the start of the end of dasy
$3 is kind of a lot
and, depressing scene..
00,10days*
$1 for 22 minutes of entertainment
Sounds good to me
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
sonic rainboom
the end of daisy
<--- Oh a board meetng?
More if you rewatch episodes
ah right, why this ocean is filled with blood
yeah
Scarlet_Wings: i suspect you just made a reference /)
yay, evangelion
00,10it's not blood. it's red tide
so, if there was a second impact...whah was the first impact?
someone hold me?
I mean, I don't watch MLP, but I love Doctor Who
And Sherlock Holmes
How did the stream go yesterday? I was too exhausted to get up and come to it.
what*
ekips: creation of the moon
I wish those were cheaper
ekips: When Halo blew up
/me holds onto aniderp|bestcakeever :<
I dont think they would dare stop the series after s4 though with the momentum they have going.
13ekips: the black moon crashing into earth to spin off the moon, it later becomes the geofront and houses lilith
And available in the US
my tummy hurts
so, how is everypony doing today? :3
00,10second impact where 2/3 of all life on earth died
that makes sense
Sumica: Thought it was half?
^
Half I thought
00,10could be
Dr. Who is on Netflix
They said half a movie ago.
13enough of that, let's have an angel
00,10ol half
does it rly matter if it is 1/2 or 1/3 ?
ye
OH YEAH! HERE COMES KOOL AID
mlp is on canadian netlfix
Verdant_Wasp: Yes, plot holes
IT'S A MAGIC 8 BALL!!!
/me says grace over his Yakisoba while watching Evangelion.
PLENTY OF THEM
I watched the first episode of one of the series
00,10either way it's all life not just humans
just got added.
I have Netflix
I'm too immersed in this to bother commenting anymore
13maya is too stressed out
Shitload of ppl died, end
Yeah, it's been on ours for a while
it's the new movie?
But they don't have newer episodes of Doctor Who
Space Angels
only up to S2 though obviously
it is
stukkagrenades!
fdamn, I'm thinking about the abdriged version...
99%? that's not concinving me
wow, the design is even more lazy
:D
do their bombs and cannons ever have any effect
want!
Gee what a shock, conventional weapons don't work
CriticKitten exactly
00,10geomotry is out to fuck you up
05WHERES THE PILOTS?
CriticKitten: insert anime
13KnightLunaire: oh just wait
05in school sir!
Is it so much to ask that I want to watch what I want, when I want, at a reasonable price?
05DAMMIT!
just think...
lol Wrek
yes
13Wrek: we'll try to get them during recess sir!
@Shizuka: goddamnit
That's why I like Cowboy Bebop, Wrek. F'ck teenagers :P
geometry is always out to fuck you up
this gun b good
Deploy every plane
because no one has figured out a good system for TV shows
WHY are people still living there anyway???
when people are uploading them on youtube all the time anyway
correction
Sundaysmile: Ooooooh
Because they're stupid
05Shizuka: as long as they dont miss lunch or they will be cranky for the rest of the day.
the angel after that is probably a giant boob
13you catch it
00,10cause not many options left in the world as to where you can still live
ekips, mayby it's a beautiful place :3
no one has figured out a good system for bringing together and unifying all the different licencing agreements every company wants to make with their coontent.
lol
content
you missed that already knightlunaire
itunes is the closest.
damn
What are the movies for this week?
nuke the basterds
not kidding...
for pay per episode/content
Shizuka: 99% to hit, and 99% To fail this mission.. I see a pattern here
netflix for all you can eat streaming.
00,10Twi would love that place
Last time I tried to play a movie from iTunes I got an HDCP error
watch * :P
Cthulhu Geometry, killing humans since before time
I would totatlly pay a small amount to watch an official stream of MLP
this will be just like pokemon!
they should do something like that
WHOOOT ?!
asuka :3
they put the episode on the hasbro website after airing dont they
look at the graphs! look at it!
13never tell me the odds kid
99% to fail, and all will die
D:
Sumica: *Insert TWIGASM after seeing an entire library*
I tried checking there once and couldn't find most of the episodes :(
just preview clips
I have the equipment for broadcasting an HD stream
fuck my life
asuka is really giving shinji a run for the annoy-o-meter
but mlp isnt on tv in canada except reruns
13hopefully in 3 they flesh out where asuka's troubles stem from, since obviously we don't have the mother-committed-doll-suicide angle this time
at least asuka isn't whining
Shizuka: Why is every suit special designed?
broniezrul732: hi attention whore
she is a litlle bitchy
a little?
Verdant_Wasp: a little?
mommy complex
twilight_sprinkle: funny, i like her more than shiniji
yes, grammar nazis
00,10and shinji still has not caught on
It might get expensive to do if there were a ton of people watching...
worse than asuka
shizuka they will never do that except in weird abstract open for interpretation
Hello everypony
that's how gainax works
Sumica: What's MIsato's position in NERVE?
Hi everypony! (Happy New Year! (sooooon))

they use free streaming sites I think
it's a disco ball?! srsly?
and just use a lot of them to split it up so they dont go over the free limit
I like how these robots just destroy anything they land on and nobody charges them for damages.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE ARE WATCHING :D

OH NO! OH NO! OH NO! OH YEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Hmm
YOU JUST SAVED THE WORLD MISATO
How much?

youtube hd streaming takes about 3mbps for 1080p
KnightLunaire: wait until end of evangelino, its a 2 hour movie metaphor for masturbation

Wrek you know, with they unlimited metal sources
GASP
oh gawd no
Why only Shinji...?
00,10dad, telling shinji good job
Not bad
dawwwwwwwww
why don't the angles protect their core better?
Sumica: must be a trap
Dad is Appoint
maybe he won't be so emo anymore
if you have a 1gbps line, you can support 333 users
and it probably is
00,10cause shinji was the one to catch the angel
Of course you want more than 3mbps if you want it to buffer
yay
Sumica: Aaaand...err....Rei and Asuka?
...
Unless that takes the buffer into consideration?
fanservice....

Good Guy Shinji
After being praised
pot80: I dont know xD

Shizuka: Hie-Ka-ri?
Tank Y U foar this Mel!
If constant threats to the city prevent the kids from getting their education, the world is doomed, even if the monsters are consistantly stopped.

00,10well it dont hurt that shiji wore auskas plug suit at one point
I hate going back to school
he loves growing things...
haha
he likes crossdressing
<-- First hand experience on pain
reminds me of nagatos philosophy
00,10and yes the plug suits are shapd for the pilot it belongs to.
Shinji must of been made in a test tube, and some one accidently put chemicals in that make him extreme attractive to everyone, and also extremely emo
now what does that tell us about shinjji's built?
No wonder Shinji's got endless pictures of him in a dress
bishie pheromones

<--- Siscon? XD
wat
guilt for what
cue angel attack
:D
00,10and shinji is molested again
guilt for putting his sis in the hospital
Suddenly Near Sex guys
XD
ANOTHER GUY WHO WANTS INTO SHINJI'S PANTS
Sundaysmile: how did that happen?
twilight_sprinkle: when shinji first piloted the eva, when the third angel attacked, the dudes sister was injured
shinji fondue
the first attack
lawl
00,10man just think what molestia would be like
Guys, it's just an innocent glomp.
Sumica: Ill ask her
We need a counter for people who want to make filthy love to that dork.
i'm amazed the penguin didnt try yet
Bronysith: oh, i see thx
Sumica: Molestia in an EVA?+
shinji was the pilot
glomp doesn't sound innocent at all
Molestia as an angel? we're doomed
Apparently, being terminally miserable and eternally sad is sexy. Wish to heck I'd know THAT back in the day.
more fan service
00,10well the penguin was waiting for shinji in the bathroom
ohgod I'm imagining that right now Rustyheadphones
<--- Legsocks?
dirty little penguin
Poor Shinji probably will act like one of the Venture kids in bed. "SHE'S TOUCHING MY SPECIAL SQUARE!"
Rustyheadphones: make a crossover :3
yay, asuka developing character
00,10oh what's this Auska is opening up and happy
Bronysith as if it would matter
the designer of that suit sure was a normal guy without any background thoughts
Bronysith ;)
Dat plot
plugging the plot
oh look, butts
StinkomanFan, you mean Dean?
Michael: I would, but I don't know much about NGE
<-- Low Ride too
05back with custom ramen soup
05<3
the world is fll of great th- oh shit its an angel!
he totally did not intend to see halway nude 14 year olds when he designed that suit
yeah, what pervert
Exactly Kandarihu
FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
what asuka said
why don't they talk?
00,10good thing she admited she was happy
oh yes
no shit asuka
Wrek: did you steal from me? thats what i had for dinner :|
this can only end well
inb4 shit hits the fan
13what? character development for my asuka? oh we can't have that, DROP THE BRIDGE
I don't know
nope no happiness for you
00,10come play with us auska
LOL
<--- Stable mental mind
ANGEL
SYMBOLISM!
possession?
I've seen that guy here a couple times though
should that happen?
hallucination much?
WELL
FUCK
break the walls down
Dark_Horst: well, EVAs are angels actually
recently returned
not a hallucination
00,10nice drift
the real deal
wait
3000 points!
oh cool
so that's why they wanted us to hold that EVA
I'm guessing he just took a look at the nick list and left when there wasn't anyone he recongnized
-.-
asuka's not supposed to be in there
Well, there goes one of our main Characters
I'm gonna be blunt here, even with sound I probably wouldn't be able to figure out WTF is going on
ASUKA NOOOOOOOOOOO
Well, Asuka's f'cked
Favorite homestuck song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-_3T3JLnoM
How come the lower half of his glasses are having a siezure?
asuka ded? wow, that was more fast that i could imagine
DerpyMuffins: why, they even gave them a free eva unit
Well she was happy
When Happy
Shit goes down
And you go sad again, simply plot points
why asuka?!
RDX used to have a channel on here for his forum; he was probably looking for those people
Vordox or you die
twilight_sprinkle, you get what you paid for.
twilight_sprinkle: Didn't that suit just blow up?
00,10So i hear you like inapprorate music.
...Why does Shinji have breastplates?
"Just as we fear" So Gendou f'cked it up?
okay, I'll humor your Homestuck stuff
StinkomanFan: Why don't you?
nuuuuuuu
Since you had to listen to me talk about MLP for half an hour :P
Lol
"it's blue"
DerpyMuffins: but...it was free
saddest fight ever....
who the hell the script of this scene?
I don't, haha
ekips, in the original series, they identified angels by their blood type, blue meant angel
You only got through the first act
that's everything you can tell from an indepth analysis
:P
I just can't get into it
AdamTheDuck oh
most brutal fight ever
i want him fired. asuka!
because the first part is so boring
AdamTheDuck: So it was Blue all along?
Seriously, it's like they originally wrote Shinji as a woman and changed his gender at the last minute considering how immasuline he is
So I feel like I'm missing out
i love sad scenes
You know how you have a friend that shows you a movie
So you watch it
StinkomanFan, and Asuka as a man?
I didn't even get through the first act
maybe shinji was made for the yaoi fangirls
And you're friend looks over and you purposely not smile
or even most of the way through it
Sumica: Nothing inappropriate here
Verdant_Wasp: You're fired, you're fired, YOU'RE FIREEEEEEEEED YOU'RE FIREEEEEEEEEEED
KnightLunaire what with the yaoi fanboys?
And he says, "Just wait, it gets better"
whoa arm wtf?
00,10oh just wait
But it doesn't get better
@ekips: them too
Verdant_Wasp: (that joke was from A Bug's Life)
And through the whole movie, he keeps saying that
OH THAT'S CHEATING
Well this is nothing like that
wow
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
ok, cause i didnt get it
dat was unexpected
Oh look, the nightmare of every japanese child EVER
ew
I seriously just don't have the time or attention span to sit through all that
Because it actually does get better
THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY
I tried twice
the second time I got a little farther
How far?
Aaaaand without audio it looks like Shinji grew gills
there wasn't even a story yet
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME MASCULINE, THAT IS NOT PART OF MY JOB
oh yes we can
I had to find objects around the armless guy's house
Yea
it was like
00,10assuming direct controll
What
what is the point of this
Inb4 Nightmare fuel....
Umm
asuka had to choke a bitch
You can skip that you know
now you get to watch your eva kill your friend firsthand, have fun shinji
00,10I know you will feel thins shinji
Oh God I love this scene...
:'(
really?
I had a friend who told me I couldn't
Now if only EVA-03 was equipped with the dummy plug.
The first video game
oh boy
...Please tell me Shinji didn't grow gills
Rape bot activated
Is just to show you what happened to the house
xD
You can go to the next part at any time you want
which would be required for hd stream.
By the looks of it...
StinkomanFan: no.......much worse
remote control
and perfectly fitting music too
Pretentious soundtract time!
and my fav music
DAT inappropiate theme
hmm
Gendo is a complete an utter monster
Time for unfitting music
It's still not inapproriate
It's fitting for the tragedy of this scene.
13remember, asuka is feeling this now
This is some fitting music
HDCP stripper...
BOOO THIS MUSIC SUCKS
That sounds perfect
so, what exactly is the reason for using inappropriate music?
This is NOT inappropriate music Mica...
well he COULD have just ripped the capsule out
feeling ALL of it
please don't
No more copyright errors for me
why don't you put THE PRAYER while you're at------oh, thanks for reminding us Shizuka :)
lol
I'm not sure what they want me to feel right now
Death metal would be appropriate now
:'(
So... Would Guile's theme go with this?
MadSurge: nah
00,10she feels alllllll of this
yes
sure
Dayum
NOM NOM NOM
all the depression
RIP AND TEAR
oh mai
CUE GUILE'S THEME
That will allow you to do full 1080p
All da feels

Sumica, not anymore
Sumica: THIS IS NOT INAPPROPRIATE MUSIC
YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS
what the actual fuck man
RIP AND TEAR

Such great music
through component outputs
08,01KnightLunaire: YES!
Needs more blood I think.

Not convinced
well at least he doesntsee it
08,01KnightLunaire: i'm so glad someone else knows of that
LOL i dont think that much
just a guess
*brohoff*
well it probably comes with some other channels
he's probably hearing the music too

THE TUBE
THE F*CKING TUUUBE
I don't know if you can buy just that one

08,01StinkomanFan: you too
rainbow ftw
o.o
maybe I'll give Homestuck another shot
THE CLIFFHANGER GO
Dat rainbow
they really decided to bite the bullet on that one
after I skip that boring stuff
:P
Sumica, was that scream there in the Japanese version?
asuka died way cooler in the orignal movie
00,10yes
I never noticed that before o.o
this was crazy /)O,......,O(\
asuka was a bullet Buytoast?
StinkomanFan: she's huge! So it must mean she has huge guts!
She.....

:P
shinji is now mad, prepare yourselves :d
Cameh_Dude: 2nd (new) movie

Verizon kinda sucks now
AS USUAL, I SEE?
Don't get Satellite

And has been shown on this stream several times. :P
CriticKitten: If Asuka lives or not, or does ANYTHING

CriticKitten: the movies follow somewhat differently sroty, in the original anime asuke did die iirc
CriticKitten: So yes, it's a spoiler on a grand position, wether you do or not =P

I really hate penguins

No, it isn't, because we've seen this before. >_> And I'm not going to argue for twenty minutes so you both can save it now.
Sorry. FiOS is not available in your area. Enter a different location.
00,10and funny thing is auska realised she can laugh
CriticKitten: Then don't spoil =P
nothing is ever available in my area

Vordox: Shut up.
CriticKitten: he hasnt seen it, and ive only seen parts of it
I'm pretty sure he's known where I live for like 6 years

Well, there goes the Geofront.

Dakka, an onomonopia for the sound a chaingun makes
they are gathering aggro
dakka is the best orc word
Soooo, where exactly do these Angels come from?
StinkomanFan, just because you don't like them doesn't mean you ahve to hat them
haha

One nice thing about that angel. It's core is exposed.
Only a couple thousand houses to check

Scarlet_Wings: from spaaaaaaaaaace

Dark_Horst, the only people I've ever been that mad at are politicians and the worst of the pundits.
Shinji, brain. Brain, Shinji.
CriticKitten: she Almost hit its core with the nuke, that wouldve killed it, but in the last moment it blocked the core
00,10you dont call daggers conventional CriticKitten?
xD
BIT the dust?
especially people I talk to
Let's throw Shinji's emotional issues in there. Maybe that'll kill the monster like it did HALF THE AUDIENCE
i wonder if it's leg twichtes when you poke that brain matter
squeeeeeesh
So helping
Sumica: You consider stabbing something like THAT with daggers to be the "conventional" way to kill it? :P

Ow
There sure is a lot of screaming in this.

ouch
NIPPLE
sorry
he seems to have lost his skin
Think how much this must hurt
NOW KISS
He probably didn't need it
BOOM
KnightLunaire, this series suddenly makes sense
boob hug!
xD
Don't touch his muscles! It'll hurt like a motherf*yay*er
Eva transcending my ASS. SHINJI transcending-- that I can see now.
Evangelion is a huge metaphor for sex
DerpyMuffins: He's becoming pure energy
KnightLunaire: was that a rape joke?
no
lol
Blood everywhere
The 10th Angel has become... Rei.
Fun fact: Giant sized Rei?
KnightLunaire: ok then :)
This was in the plan?
when will something happen that is not part of thier plan?
I want that
Vordox: foreshadowing? xD
And FINALY Shinji gets laid
DerpyMuffins: yep daddy was using them all along
Waz: XD
by his mom
EWwww
mari girl...
THERE
BISHIE PHEROMONES
"I get it now", you're the only one who gets it, Mari.
i knew it
00,10kabooom
now, get asuka on the screen
So now Shinji dies aftering becoming pure energy?
05so evas are angels, but domesticated?
05:|
third impact?
Wrek, not domesticated
Wrek, controlled, restricted
00,10enslaved
and then eveyone died
mor elike prisioners Wrek... i think
"Ohey, wassup?"
Welp time for the world to end. :D
05right
is this the last movie?
nope... 2/4
he is now Genocyber
no verdant
YAY
00,10and the end of the movie
soooo... everybody gonna die now?
That's what you get for punching Jesus, the apacolypse
yay
dun dun dun
no not the end yet
The End
DAMNIT CLIFFHANGERS
yay
Verdant_Wasp, sorry, nope.
how the hell are they gonna make 2 more movies?
everyone is going to die
Dark_Horst, yeah. why not. sounds fun
Im back
its not the end yet btw
half the cast is dead
Verdant_Wasp: Very very nice pacing? :P
13remember the first rule of evangelion
now i want the next movie :(
wait for the final scene
13it gets worse
can't wait for the third
Shizuka: XD
its not over peeps
wb
Verdant_Wasp: Because.
Just like Patrick predicted Anger
AND WORSE
theres one more scene after the credits
jeezus
Shizuka: Well, tell us when you find a good version of Part 3!
Shizuka: dat is why it's awesome :D
13sumi going to show the first six minutes of 3 right
Shizuka: And VASTLY more confusing.
Wrek, in the original series, they explain that the armour isn't there for proctection for the EVA, but rather a means for the pilot to control the EVA
Verdant_Wasp, they originally planned for 4 movies, but they gave up and they're only doing 3.
00,10yus
13<3
YES
So...
Sumica: oly 6 minutes? Bad version?
How is everyone?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Tumblr Spotlight: Slice of Life / The Strange Adventures of Crackpot / Ask Discord
05these guys pronounce the g in evangelion strange :|
13Vordox: official version, the only one of decent quality to get out
DO IT YOU SILLY FILLY
bored, just getting some cleaning done
Shizuka: Oooh,cam corder, but what about us non native japanese speakers?
Oh
the movies seem to be okay
im watching End of Eva on January 8th so this was nice
just a bit too different from the original for my taste
Waz: You're a wiz then here. :D
Shizuka: Whoa!
13the camrips are scattered around the rest of the movie and atrocious quality
<3 Can't wait!
Vordox: ... xD
brb
gah
The first six minutes manages to make even less sense.
I never did understand this series much
Yes, that's possible.
Is it like six minutes of DBZ where it's the main charactors yelling?
Er is the third movie going to be shown?
that moment when you purchase origins of species and are happy
Am I reading that right?
shinji is voiced by a woman oO
StinkomanFan, it's an entire battle against an angel.
Third movie's not out in good quality yet. Only a six minute clip of it.
13KnightLunaire: most young male characters are, not limited to japan
...Actually can we stream DBZ on here? I need either that or wrestling to get my Testesterone up.
weird
13see tara strong playing timmy turner
o rite
StinkomanFan, you need TTGL
Meh. I can always see it later. I will be back in a bit.
Wrek: I have a question
00,10I cant get it in a good quality cam rip
TTGL?
Shizuka: i thought Shinjis english dub VA was a man?
Wrek: What's NC's "better" stuff?
00,10they are all shitcams
StinkomanFan: gurren lagann
i need desktop ponies /)O,......,O(\
Shizuka: or Drake Bell playing Timmy in the live action movie... wait...
Ah.
Tara Stron voiced other young boy roles, like Omi from Xaolin Showdown.
Well, this means I will have to travel to japan and watch it there
13rule one go!
00,10side note Desktop ponies has been updated
Omi :3
oh oh
back
Stinger time
And then
Waz, that's trippy. When are we watching it here?
NOPE
lol
SPEAROW'D
Dat Cliffhanger break...?
another eva?
No apolocalypse for you.
spear of longinus?
LET THERE BE YAOI
THAT WAS SHORt
00,10unit 6

Verdant_Wasp: lots

I wonder if there is any good fanart of Shin....OHMYGOD
13oh well
Pirate Asuka is best Asuka!
Time to listen well.
Sumica, no we don't
13the awesome is what we're here for :)
yay
xD
Let's see how my Japanese is.
o.O
Asuka with 2 peglegs
I see an space anus
13they're rambling about decelerating in orbit
Shizuka: Is Phase playing again?
Is a space anus like a Skygina?
looks like breaking bad
:(
she's just afk
StinkomanFan, mind keeping it classy around here please?
:o
are we in space?
actually really only hear blablabla this time
Sunday Smile started it
got enough stages thereß
Asuka is back
Cant understand anything! :P
The Evangelion Unit 02-Dash
13according to wiki, even though third impact was halted, it pretty much hosed what was left of the world
Asuka Lived? =3
Gudu laku
asuka is alive?
Vordox, indeed :$
lol Geko and Neo were here a couple hours ago
:o
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnt9pRDdHk8
Apparently Asuka joined Daft Punk
so what exqactly is this one now?
DAT SCREAM
Dark_Horst: preview of 3.0
An ANGEL
her hit number, one moar time
Dark92Enigma, it's the first 6:35 of Rebuild of Evangelion 3.33
more screaming?
HAI ASUKA
it uses at fields as propulsion?
eyepatch <3
13she's yelling for mari to support her
You can't kill Asuka
This is Future Asuka, right?
Shizuka: I thought you said Mari was useless in 3?
13she is :P
XD
13she only gets that shot off :P
Suddenly Tetris
O_o
00,10docking the hard way

Kandarihu: :(
Wait...
WAsn't Unit 2 destroyed...?
this thing reminds me a lot of dante 01
u make it?
13asuka making up for not catching sahaquiel in rebuild 2
...I miss Future Twilight. She was cute
looks awesome and all, but wtf is going on
no
13instead catches shinji's tomb in orbit
Counting down?
Vordox, this isn't Unit 2. It's Unit 02-Dash
hai
i wish :P
Kandarihu: It's approximately 20% cooler than the previous iteration.
13epic theme time
Shinji's tomb? o.o
lol
o.o
Ohai tentacles
the music eva 3.33 sounded pretty grim for the most
13asuka's annoyed by the angel attacking now
Wat
13see? useless mari
TBH Shinji would've died LONG ago anyway
13arael's triumphant return
she calls her glasses?
Jabai = "This is bad"
Asuka keeps getting bucked up in this version...
which one is this?
um, wtf is happening?
^
if vinyl was an angel
Wakagate = "I know that"
aniderp|bestcakeever, Rebuild of Evangelion 3.0
Alchemist: I told you that it managed to make less sense.
13stream hates this sequence X3
13DO SOMETHING BAKA SHINJI
13okaaaaay
boy this music sounds good
keep trying vordox
shinji!
Verdant_Wasp: I'm hearing phrases, okay =P
Verdant_Wasp: I'm not fluent, just general anime knowledge
Even when he's taking a nap, Shinji's more useful than the rest of the cast
Kencolt: only seen the original series minus the end of eva... and i hate Asuka, is she at least a little better here?
and then Shepard was put into project lazarus
eat my one year course

You'd look good in one Meth
Have you seen my IRL Singing Video?
I'm a little fat.

This is tekkit, aren't spwan eggs craftable?

Barbetos: Oatmeal is delicious.

Comes out better when you mix with milk instead of water, imo.
and in KVIrc
lol
I think I actually just installed the program without the smilies
Is it that bad?
I'd just rather see the text
than an image
I wonder if you can make pizza in minecraft
no one else sees the same images I do anyway

Pixels are the order of the day
Barbetos: It's hip to be square!

Song stuck in my head now
quite, Shizuka, quite.
:p
Carbon fibre?
looks like lines of black cocaine
One HELL of a drug
I think there is something hidden on the roof :O
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic Cover Sketches on Twitter
my guess is hidden pipes?
Probably did not know you where down underground or something
LOL, I think Shizuka was surprised to see it's nightime already
not there xD
spidey says herroooo
Damn spiders crawling on mah walls
Oh look, it's confused
lol
That's why I pour lava all around my walls.
lava walls hoooooo!
i mean the other house
there is a thing hidden
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98vZuid_744
I hope the mobs don't gain any intelligence and start breaking glass to get in. >>
lol
If I have multiple buildings I will create underground interconnecting tunnels between houses.
Safer than running around in panic between buildings.
:D
what?
whoa
I was ready for a fioght!
SAXTOn HAAAALLLE!
the spider !
I swear, I thought the spider had gotten through the glass
i too
guess I should continue making my bed up
blegh
I think it's a visual glitch
xD
Oh god, it bought friends with it.
I forget, do Minecraft have seasons?
to many spider for you O.O
They want in
One of them is Twilight Spackle
Twilight Spider?
Yep
Java: i don't believe so, But there are areas that are a bit diffrent
Java i do not think so. Biomes.
I dun remember seeing fall colors. Just different lighting
I wish they incorporate season change in the next update.
Say in winter several monster won't appear because they hibernate
I just want starbound
you think Notch would stop being lazy to make his game more interesting?
Its gona be awesome
you silly goose
Starbound?
the spider sound is disgusting
those spiders sound like there faping
The spiders sounds anoying
Starbound is the new game the people of Terraria made
or is making I mean.
oh
All the terraria goodness, with mechs, and space from what I can tell
Dat nanosuit? O.o
I can't even play Terarria. It can't run on my PC
Yes please
Thats too bad
I know
Terraria is so much fun

DerpyMuffins: cya

At 12, I will make a New Year's Resolution to finally get an XBox... and put pony stickers on it
Kammerjunk: At least your queen is a public figure....
Queen of England right?
No, Denmark. Basically the same, I'd think.
What is the economic debt of Greenland?
Sits on the throne and uses a lot of money.
Kammerjunk: They don't pay taxes? I heard England royalty start paying taxes

Ohai RDash5000 and MLP_Brovakiin :)

Well, I like Aventador though
Ohai thelonecubone ^-^
oh Wrek is streaming?
When is there a new episode of MLP?
Yes yes
Lamborghini is so different than other companies, and their first ever car that's not a bunch of rectangles is the Miura

Mr Piffles
Seen the Spyker Laviolette LM85?
:D
'ello

berberborscing: I don't remember. I had to google it. It's the Dutch made supercar right?
legit spike sound effects :)
:D
I think. Not my fave car though.
It's not the stupid Bugatti Veyron
What am I seeing here?
berberborscing: I like Veyron.

Favorite car is what Russia has recently released: http://www.thewordofmatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Marussia-B2-Wallpapers-28.jpeg
lols
:O OH WOW.
Thats amazing!!
Cut pieces of cards.
Crackle the magic dragon
berberborscing: Oh wow. What the engine?
Ugh.
a little... hare
Ooh, there's a Marussi B1 too.
oh god
dragons + bananas
Getting a migrane from hunger, and am annoyed at the pizza place taking too damn long.
mr piff
Marussi reminds me of Indian car brand Maruti.
You're a mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmdragon that like mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmbanana's
magic draon stuff
The Marussia B2 has a 3.5L V6 or 2.8L Turbocharged V6
lol tellar
Heh, I like this guy. XD
^
zero fucks given
Wrek: holy hell man the Octavia looks utterly magnificent so far
awwww
Puff, the magic dragon~
bbl
Someone wanted to know what engine Marussia B2 had
berberborscing: Nice. Even though I want to know the reliability. Is it Italian or Japan :p
It's Russian.
Pshh, zdrastje
lolwut?
Means Whatever in russian
Found image of Marussia B1: http://www.gtspirit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/marussia_b1_live.jpg
Ha. Dat bagpipe.
fluffy octavia :3
I mean the reliability, is it need a lot of taking care of like Italian cars or very reliable and rarely break down like Japanese cars.
She isnt really that fluffy.
05golden cello
WOW
Shiny @_@
Probably fragile like an Italian one.
Wrek, Gold cello is best cello :3
berberborscing: heheh. I see.
http://i.imgur.com/O191y.jpg
the finger trick would be really cool if he had 6 -4 afterwards
Seeing how explicit the design is and how fast it can go
that 80's cell phone
Bronysith: Dude that's depressing.
Java: indeed
Once again, Sith links relevant images.
Bronysith: Oh my
swag
berberborscing: Supercars don't always equal to being fragile :/
Volvo = tank
berberborscing: indeed
woah
:O
I'm gonna search up if Marussia B2 is weak or strong. It had approximately 280 hp so
Hoohoo!
Magic~
like I said, swag

Bronysith, true story.

berberborscing: government car?
Go get Tesla Roadster....
more swag
He doesn't have the money for an electric sports car...
Oh okay.
/me claps
Insurance would be extremely expensive
berberborscing: well yea, insurance is a bitch
Considereing it is electric AND a ssports car...
hi :)
hey
I just got back :P
Cuz oil is only gona be here for 50-100 more years.
yay
then everyone's gonna wake up at 4 in the morning bicycling to their jobs
berberborscing: Yeah, nice car though. Good Miles per charge too.
berberborscing: Some of our govt official ride horses to their jobs.
When oil runs out, I'll drop my jaw if I ever see a Hummer again.
I'm surprised Meth didn't know about DotD, heh
seriously?
nice glasses
yep lol
Gas is probably gone so fast because people drive Hummers when they should consider getting a cheaper, less bulletproof car
eeyup
bc IDIOTS
"DURRR, BIGGER CAR IS BETTER ALL TIMES
Why I want a Ford Focus. Hopefully electric by then.
There's an old saying in China: A man have to know these things: Poetry, playing music, archery, horse riding.... I forget the rest. But yeah. a man need to learn those skills.
All Hummer drivers are Pendejos :>
thats sad
Java: lol
Males only like big cars because they are overcompensating for something that is rather small.
All Hummer drivers have crazy kids... it's a moving prison
I wonder if he knows about the rest of the LoS series
Not all the time.
hmm
otakon: Good advice though. Riding horses = driving a car in modern era
That's just a stereotype, Im sure.
it's rare to see a young kid who only likes the originals
Archery = using a gun
poetry = literacy
Life will evolve into minecraft.
music = misic
Fluxum, if that ever happens, don't go there.
Lol.
Did you ever ask him how he started playing the originals?
05CD's?
05no.
I can never see electric Hummers...
ZE MAGICKS
ze magics
Magic! *snort snort
My dad has a whole collection of CDs. Pretty nifty.
anyone ever fuck up a cover letter?
Wrek: what did you use to make the wood pattern?
ROCKET MAAAAAAAAN
No, that would be interesting to find out though
bleh, spyroforum thread tools are hard to use :(
Heh. ABBA.
Wow, waking up at 1am, my sleeping pattern sucks.
The answer is bad audio quality.
Lol, hey dari
Hey
:D
Dat glove.
Nice.
My mom suggested I be a car engineer. I'd design a car for any company called the Dash. (Anyone knowing where I'm getting this from)
berberborscing: So if your brother want a car that use less gas how about the old Austin Mini?
Mini Cooper, not the new one
He wants a car thats mostly electric
I kind of messed up splitting one =/
oh ok
He loves the economy. He's a better Fluttershy thn I.
Even though I bet Mini Cooper are much fun to drive
HA, he doesn't know about the rest of TLoS
Hey
I'm a big guy but I want an Austin Mini Cooper :p
If your wondering about my name, I am literally sick.
Did you guys talk about me?
Good luck with that :)
heheheheh
We just wanted to know if you knew about the rest of TLoS
Nope.
[7:20:19 PM] Meth: I only played the 1st 3, season of flame, and one of the PS2 games
A New Beginning and Eternal Night are the two games before Dawn of the Dragon
They're nothing like the originals though
When I was little I dreamed of driving super fancy flying cars... but there needs to be one someday designed by a car company consistent of where the designer is a brony
yeah
It was the one with David Spade and Elijah Wood as voice actors
XD
yep
I think I beat A New Beginning in one day, maybe Eternal Night too.
they figured it out!

Bronysith: :D

I got RSV
Could be (any car company here, maybe even Lolvo) Dash

My baby Brother n Sister gave it to me.
Just a Baby Cold.

But my baby brothers and sisters gave me a baby flu

uh....whats this?
I'm bad at drawing. When it gets to small details, I add too much
And everything looks WAYYY too elaborate
How long does Pokemon Yellow take to beat?
berberborscing: artists know how to take their time, it is an artform afterall...
BMW M3 and M5 design is much more boring than Lolvo though.
are
bleh grammar :/
Java: lolvo?
Beat as in Elite 4, or beat as in catch them all?
:P
Range Rover = Game Over, Volvo = Lolvo
probably not long at all if you know what you're doing
Volvo :
oh right, if you want to "catch 'em all" you'll probably have to do some trading
So much detail Wreky.
<3
berberborscing: so anytime i see someone in a volvo, i should lol?
I know nothing bout Pokemon. I am a noob
I'm not sure how that's simulated with an emulator
Not on yellow IIRC
oh really?
Oh.
Blue and Red need to trade
hm
lemme pull up an image i saw from an MS Sam reads stupid errors
that would make sense I guess
But I think Yellow has them all, not sure thoguh
though*
Anyone wanna see me stream?
My god, the grain on that thing....~
Stream what?
http://giveupinternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lolvo-love-this-car-or-give-up-internet.jpg
Bronysith: The cars are safe and strong. But the designs are plain and boring.
Spyro, Pokemon, Crash
lol, Lolvo is real
Ohai

Ooooh, you clever bastard.
Jim, ah. How is work?
Prince, make a twitch.tv account while im setting up
Just gotta take a shower first.
Well, it's kind of exhausting, but interesting.
You have to make an account to watch on it?
Same as always then?
No, to go on the chat

If I get one more ad I'm opening this in Chrome
MLP_Brovakiin: :(
yah... need to get that lol
(my chrome has adblock)
The best magic tricks are those done with diversion, in my opinion. That is, when you distract the audience for just a second because you can only focus on one thing at a time.
/me snickers
lol johnathan
Adblock. It helps.
Srsly.
Poor John.
Kammerjunk, that is what "magic" tricks are...
Alright im on chrome
which spyro, 1, 2, or 3?
no more bloody ads
I'm still baffled how he did it.
Hmm
Who is Octavia sitting next to?
I figure it's a diversion tactic, but....
Have you played Enter the Dragonfly or A Hero's Tail Meth?
vinyl
I totally missed it. O.o
Start with 1
I think I did Enter the Dragonfly
Panda: Well, the previous one was just the tapes playing a set disc.
Okay
I don't see Vinyl Scratch. lol
1\
C4!!!!!
Be Right Back, taking this shower.
CriticKitten, seeing it on a screen and not in person just makes the tactic that much harder to follow.
I do enjoy magic though. It's just the right sort of sleight of hand.
^
Fun to watch.
^
But it's not easy to fool me. XD
HI EVERYPONY:)
Normally.
Hello, caps-crazy.
Magic though? I always feel like a total dummy.

he gave birth with his hands
Very nice...
impressive

I knew she'd like it, she's a sucker for cute things.
The tank's reflective, maybe? O.o

hax I call hax
i see though the illusion, theres a mirror in the tank
He's using the console commands in real life.
It is.
Is Teller part fish?

Bronysith: I'd presume so.
XAX: whens the new season?
i got pinged
Oh that reminds me, have the new episodes been released yet? (I've been living in a hole for the last 3 months)
What if you get into magic so you can become a pickpocket?
No idea.
Jim: indeed they have
there was just an argument on spyroforum about that movie
And the more that you know, then the more you can grow, then the more loopholes where the law can go
and that she didn't like it

Hah.
I look older than him.
I dont get it
My face decides to spam freckles everywhere.
And he's on this show already? Welp, so much for my life. :p
I liked the movie, but you do have to admit the dragons are pretty ugly
At 15, I'll be ont his show for having no life anywhere except my PS3 ^^

Not too bad.
Tell me kammer
Ok, for a little kid, he knows too much. We need to make sure he does not multiply.
NOAW
I think the inside of the box had a false bottom

And the hand's not fake from the looks of it. That is pretty clever.

gtg cya
that would be awesome
cya
so it kind of creeps me out that he expects us to think he's sexy
Lawl
see ya Afflict
That's really high praise, though.
Still, you have to give him credit for being able to pull those off.
Hah, looked like the father was booing.
Seriously.
Indeed, CriticKitten.
maybe to other 14 year olds
Good for him ^_^ lots more motivation to continue on
If you tell me the secret, I'll give you a cookie ('o.)
CriticKitten: Must mean a lot to him to get it from Penn and Teller.
lol
oh mai
Having masters of the craft tell you that? Man, that's some fantastic stuff for someone his age.
Im interested in how this trick works.

I hope he keeps it up.

That introduction and voice immediately made me think of Trixie...
this is my fetish
Malefor
Oh.
Yep
/me raises hand.
....she DOES kinda remind me of Trixie.
Oh God
It is Trixie, Jim.
good ol' nine-year-olds
O.o
How did that go?
Kammerjunk: the trick is, she makes him the slave
don't do that...
:D
She's got a lisp.
rrrrrrrr
Bronysith: He has no idea what he's getting into, but by God he'll love it.
GilDash: its cute
I guess you could say... interesting?
It's not a magic trick, she's just very into kink.
Kammerjunk: indeed...
Bronysith: I wasn't saying anything about it, I just noticed was all.
Did they get there parents on you?
lol
She has lovely legs. >///>

Well!

How?!
Wow, she untied that knot damn fast.
So he is 14?
so... 13?
And kids, that is what happens when you bone in a small, confined area.
maybe 14
Panda: XD
I don't know when their birthdays are
He would be 14, since it is December
Oh.
So, they used the jacket to clean up the mess. XD
Breasticles.
GilDash, what mess ;)
CriticKitten: Well, practice makes perfect.
That was really cool.
Lol
well i have no idea how that was done
Bravo.
Panda: Well, that was part of the trick. ;)
what did they fight about?
But I'm baffled at how she got the knots and coat off that quick.
I don't remember
y are we not watching Hub?

Paul: because Spiderman.mp4
lol
I appreciate how they don't reveal the way it works.
Oh hey, Scottish lad.
Do they still use the forums?
Nah
no
It leaves the whole thing a mystery.
I swear, Scottish accents are so amazing.

CriticKitten, they dont have to because I will :)
Scottish voice reaing that:Can't unhear

But she didn't post much

Nah, that doesn't happen
Oh right.

I turned it off

Hrm.
Getting Penn and Teller up... now, is this to distract them further,,,?

Your modesty is amazing too

Housey is best word
Toilet.
oh there's a good gif of that
But I don't want to find it
Bronysith: aaahhh, the good old days
I'm curious what the trick is, now.
Aww, you can't tell me there is one then not give it to me
Darn, I need to go to le toilet noaw
Oh man, it is on!
I have no idea how I would find it
i'm a bit iffy on how this works
:P
RDash5000: indeed
mainly on hos it's supposed to fool them
I haven't quite figured out what his trick is.
Comes now, I guess.
the prediction is the briefcase?
let me gues, he predicted the winners of each thing
Lesse.

hax
dafuk?
not really a magic trick
^
id like to see the letters that were on the board
Housey isn't exactly a common word. XD
Color me impressed
HAAAAAAAAAX
he's hacking the world
He's a time lord
I'm sure
He must've wrote that up during the event somehow....
It is all in the confusion from the begining.
He's a wizard.
http://i.imgur.com/NIqGI.jpg
Oh.. please no..
or tell them before hand what words and where to throw
Scoots!
By the way, evenin' y'all~
The "housey" thing is the really clever bit.
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Ponyguy
Time machine
Good. He didnt fool them.
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
doctor who
PonyGuyRulz: that self advertisement
PonyGuyRulz: I see your advertising your own things, eh?
lol
Huh.
uh oh
nice.
Wow.
:O Wow!
:P
DID SOMEONE CALL HIS NAME?
Good for him!
He got 'em.
It's obvious, really.
He teleported it.
how the hell did he pull that off
inb4 he's a time lord
HEY EVERYONE! Go spam PonyguyRulz's stuff with Scootaloo!
someone fool morgon freeman
he used a different trick
RDash5000, Too late
He wrote with his heel
not bad
a secret hole in his pants maybe
So, after going on and getting called out for being lazy he actually managed to fool them the second time? Awesome.
Scoot-Scootaloo: you mean LadyGaga images
maybe he can write with his toes?
Umm... am I seeing somethng in the stream?
Dat Rarity.
Well, he said that he didn't write it.
He had to have written the prediction during the event, but that's just about all I can reason out.
brb
I see a image....
sexy rarty
and folded it up?
EWWWW Rarity :|
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
wat da fek rarity?
He be back
Sword! Give me sight! beyond sight!
There's nothing there, what are you on about?
Teller produced a grand total of 2401 coins.
4
42
ITS 4
It's totally 2401. L is real.
4!!!
b
that an epensive call
All the above because he is a piggy bank.
pound? this is a UK show?
yes
If he did write it down, he had to do it after the rock paper scissors.
Java: It sure is.
Java: It's on ITV, so yes.
I'd like to see some of them street magicians seen in TV, in that show
wpw
wow
Nyst: Or maybe he had two pieces of paper, one in each shoe.
lawl dat commercial skip
Since it's Las Vegas I thought it's an US show
true, but then he still had to write down the scores and the words.
Kammerjunk. how would he know the dart scores?
051 more ep after this than more drawing
Kammerjunk: With every possible dart score? Not to mention "Housey" which is not a real word?
05this is basically my break
I dunno, I'm stumped how he concealed all of that.
why must the brits be so funny?
Punkie_Pue: I told you, he's a wizard.
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
back
Nyst: Magnet?
lol
Okay so the soonest he could have written those was right after the words.
To write down the answers without ANYONE noticing for all of that time?
That alone is clever.
sleigh of hand.
CriticKitten: Focus is a tricky thing, I guess.
Bex?
he has a COD perk
maybe someone Did notice,they dont ask the audience
Our eyes see everything, but our brains only focus on one thing at a time.
I would not dare being on first row in a magic show
Mr_Anybody: Extreme Conditioning?
and they didnt show the magician to us at all times
but still his hands didn't go near his trouser pockets from what i saw
I would be hexed
Nyst: A truth used by magicians just as by pickpockets
And he didn't use his pocket apparently either.
Kammerjunk: totally.
CriticKitten: Of course he didn't, he teleported it.
CriticKitten but still his hands didn't go near his trouser pockets from what i saw
maybe he has some mechanism under his suit with string that writes depending on how he moved his arm
or his leg
or any part really
CriticKitten, that has yet to be proven. They didnt check his clothing or his shoes for any tricks.
Why use mechanical deception when you can hide things in plain sight?
why does he have concrete in his head?
haha
Why not
Mr_Anybody: Because wh-
wHY Dont you have concrete on your head?
dammit
sounds hollow
It brings him joy, so why not
lol
I'm sure it's the box that sounds hollow
New TF2 hat
haters gonna hate
or that might be part of the illusion
whoa!

Uh-huh, stare at him carefully.
Panda there'd probably check during the commercial and would say if they found any proof he lied to penn and teller about the pocket stuff
Oh God no, he said MLG
And that guy was definitely good at it
....
ha
=/
hax
wat the fek
....HOLY SHIT.
Whoa!
......
I did^^
alexxm, we can only hope.
impressive
But.
whoawhoawhoa
How?
Wait.
do we need to set the flood limit higher now?
yeah, hax
WOW
I dont even.
How did he put them on, inside the box, and then put the protective visor on?
And he was holding the box that whole time....wow.
WHAT
or lower
Hm... interesting. That was one I couldnt follow, unless it was a gimmick planned before the show started.
The concrete cube: Immune to headshots
well with all the junk flying around from the hits, he couldve put on him quickly
Teller is a fourth-dimensional being. He does not care for our walls.
Shhhhh.
i guess one of the arms is fake
05he covered tellers hadn when he was knockign the ball
Hah, yeah
CriticKitten: Or is it a pair of fake hands?
05his covered hand slipperd it up the crack
05from this pocket
seriously though
05is my guess
one link will do
ahh
Hrm, maybe
that explains the knocking
we need to watch another noaw
spamming it everywhere won't make people join
so he would know when to move his arm
contrary to the popular belief of spambots
Wrek, quite possible. The billiard ball was the distraction though. Ment to be the focal point.
That would make sense, would need to see it again to be sure.
yep, and we're so focused on the knocking that we don't notice the move with the other hand
oh noes, time travelers
It sounds like someone is about to get...
/me puts on shades
...nailed.
i has egg nog. let the awesomeness commence
Yeeeeeaaaaah
http://goo.gl/SwFpY
YEAHHHHHHHH
That's the art of magic, though: diversion.
05btw this is the rarity so far
/me giggles.
have i not heard of this show because it's british, or because my head is stuck in the sand?
in the previous one there was also the bit with the glove, maybe this guy with in on it
Noice.
nice!!!
Looking good, of course.
Ohmai, Wrekart :$

Lovely <3

Hi, RDash5000
Question: Is Teller mute, or does he just choose not to talk?
same here Jim and i like it i don't like it when people try to spoil the fun by saying how it's done though
Kammerjunk: i have the same question
Kammerjunk he and penn talk when they try to figure out how the tricks are done
05imagine being an illusionist
:D
hah!
05but at the same time an assassin
i think he chooses not to
alexxm: Ah, thanks.
These tricks are really rustling my iron jimmies
Kammerjunk: It's part of his act. He chooses not to talk. I think.
I wanna be a pegasus when I grow up!
Penn and Teller ponies http://goo.gl/f82rZ
Kammerjunk well not talks more whispers in penns ear but still
When I grow up, I wanna go to the Moon!
And Meth
put them in blue body paint and they could pass as the Blue Man Group
or
Kammerjunk: why wait?
Kammerjunk, Why wait?
maybe he is a spambot
alexxm: He whispers sweet nothings into Penn's ear.
ewwww g3
those horses look terrifying
^
Wrek: you mean like appearing to be a regular user, but being all like "crush, kill, destroy, swag"?
Hax!

pff, it's just an invisible oompa loompa in there
He's breaking the fabrics of space and time guys, are you seeing this?
i saw that.
it was a fake
OOPS
Shush.
SORRY
I dunno guys. I mean, telekinesis is pretty simple, innit?
o.o
trick or no, that's still some great synchronizing.
Kammerjunk: Lol, this indeed could be an 80's music video
There's gotta be someone in there. O.o
finished streaming
There is a reason for the music.
CriticKitten: No, the fabric's too thin.
Kammerjunk, Yeah, I do 3 telekinesis every morning before breakfast.
I WANT THAT BOX!!!
That is all I will say.
Magical box.
CriticKitten: He'd light up like a dark in the candle.
What's in the box?!
...Or something.
Not better than the box that turns itself off tho :3
just use your.... IMAGINATIOOON!
What's in the booooooooooox?!
Jim, there you go.
Aha!
girl in the box
oh, a head
Oh. Wait, but that's not a very thick material, shouldn't you be able to see her when it was lit up?
Step 1: Cut a hole in the box.
that's normal
Step 2: Put a girl in that box
But.
Step 3: ???
I wonder if the lass' name is Jack.
that looks
light?
So I was right so far, girl in the box. But that doesn't explain how it can levitate....
So she'd be Jack in a box.
I pressed Back by accident
@_@
:(
this is more of a musical routine than a magic act
mirrors
Well
Did I miss anything?
dohoho
Nope
It's still very fancy
very strong string?
Well there is the whole floating bit?
yes
i did?
anyone else's stream staggerign?
no
no
what did I miss?
nah
CriticKitten: Oh it's simple; Girl can float
:P
everything
otakon: I'm thinking the weight of all that malware is slowing you down.
wut the flag
but yeah i heard backgrounds, and mirrors are a big part of this kind of stuff
i did?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!
nice
o.o
lol
Wow.
I'm at home Kammerjunk
Wow, they're fast
Set the flood limit to 1. I wanna see what will happen
Did the box change colour too?
we had an intense debate
sleight of... fashion?
Now they ARE breaking the very fabric of space and time.
my head is esploded
otakon: Oh. I got nothin', then.
in the matter of 1 second?
yes
Girl in a dress now?
To be fair, the girl being in the box was actually predictable by the name: "Cubic Act" does imply three people.

Dun dun dun
But the levitation....still haven't caught how they're doing that yet.
Ryunosuke: indeed
Wow.
so very strong fishing wire Wrek ?
Wrek, there you go. You figured it out.
Not bad, though.
also we were flooded by bots
It's magic, I ain't got to explain shit.
Kammerjunk: color wouldnt explain how the lady appeared there
lol
twice
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, she was born in the box. By the box.
lol
I bet that pole behind the box had something to do with it
If it'd hide a support structure I'd hide it behind the box, not above it.
She just kinda grew up.
Oop
bots that only said "lol"
I have no idea what he just said.
maybe she wore something so you could see her on the background
I was born out of a box, it's common in the states
lol
*couldnt
they posted so many messages that all of our computers died
Wait...
Do you mean me?
Wow.
so we all bought new ones
really?
and now here we are
maybe kind of
:P
Well, that's something of a compliment.
Dang
Wow!
Whew.
Woah
High praise.
That's actually quite a compliment
Awww
they know
awww
shame the act was good
He figured it out, eh? Well he's damn clever then because I'm absolutely baffled.
Glad they don't tell US atleast
The only thing the paper said was "BURN THE WIZARDS AND HERETICS"
Yeah
/me nods
Calling it.
i didnt pay enough attention to the background but it was pretty dark iirc, someone couldve been there
impressed they shredded it
05thign about these tricks is thatnormally
05if you guessed right
THey obviously used pixie dust, its simple
05they would still tell you no
The note said, Leave now and I'll pay you $5,000
There were only three words on that paper: "Magic. Got it."
Drew: Hahaha
my brother: How do you die with insta kill on? *dies*
Finkle is Einhorn, Einhorn is Finkle... EINHORN IS A MAN
LOL
NOOB
Well, it's half past 3 AM again, so I have to go walk my dog.
That was a really good stage act though.
The note said your fly is down
Because that's what normally goes on at half past 3 AM.
Got to love dogs who can't sleep at night
they also couldve set up mirrors that block the background but you cant see it so peopel can walk by
Jim: Oh no, she's just like a month old.
Ahhh :)

Nah, just the ROM
/me puts a piece of bread and cheese on Wrek's head.
Bronysith: :D
jim, art thou rustled?
interesting, they have another paper with the same color on those tables
Now you're a sandwich.
CriticKitten my only guess is the guys are plants
Ryunosuke, Verily
/me rustles Jim
Yeah, the tikka masala was definitely the best dish.
Oh damn Wrek. You know what that means? She's a keepa! Don't fuck it up.
im hungry...i should order some dominos...or taco bell
superretroworld: actually i think my professor already did
alexxm: And the girl would have to be, too.
TACTICAL JIMMIE RUSTLE INCOMING!!!!
Champion_of_Harmony: 2 excellent chocies
I got the ISO, how do I mod it?
Champion_of_Harmony: really taco bell orders?
no but there like 10 mjins from my house

You can't really change anything other than plain text like that
that explanation
he waves his hands around as much as that guy in the pirate island game
Oh, what is the program to change the text?
lawl
Hmmm, sleep or wrekky stream? :3c
I just used a hex editor
He sounds stumped.
lol
Bronysith: yolo must be famous atm if a professor knows about it
he's being really Vauge about this
superretroworld: no i mean my professor said the whole unique thing
smart words, they need to be ccapitalized
oh
...what Penn said
Yeah.
WHAT?
WOW!
To be honest, it was quite a trick
good trick there
he stalked them before the show :P
So was I, honestly. If the audience wasn't planted, then....
Maybe they were in on it?
That seems MUCH too random to have guessed with such precision.
I stand by my time lord theory
I GOT IT
Yeah?
PSYCIC PAPER
Such a hacker man
i wasnt paying attention to that one, but i suspect that guy with the long hair is in on it
lel

Jim: THATS GENIOUS
lol ^
potter!

Bronysith: oic
You're a wizard Michael!

he deserves automatic hugs
05Mr_Anybody: thats not desync
05thats delay
If it wasn't plants, I really don't know. Too many random factors to be that accurate.
It just seems impossible. ._.
/me wears Socks :3
i don't care, people are seeing things 2 seconds before i do >:C
for he reminds me of derpy. and anything that reminds me of derpy or any pony gets a free hug.
/me wears thelonecubone|GoW3 :3

Did he draw a face on the card?
This'll be interesting.
He's pretty nervous, but holding together well.
good morning :)
"Sure."
AKA cheating
Goodmorning DaringDerpy :)
"sure"
Ohai DaringDerpy

penn seems unimpressed
he is a wizard
Hrm.
recalibrate? its not the Normandy's cannons
http://i.imgur.com/gFqFu.jpg
hes gonna turn them overand they ll be the red signedcards
MirrorImage well the previous trick was pretty impresive so a card trick is kind of a down step
burn the witch doctor!
Poker?
Bronysith: :D
To be honest, card tricks are not that impressive anymore
HI DaringDerpy :)
He's really good with his hands here....
He's still good though

Alright.
That was really clever.
ughh

yep
lawl
if he did it with short sleeves i'd be impressed
lols
Muggles
He must have slipped them into his sleeves.
Muggles
what amateur magicians sometimes do is they make a card easier to draw than others

Shizuka: can asuka handle it?
is anyone watching The Lion King right now?
other than that he has the sleeves to pull them in and out
He didn't actually return them to that deck, obviously.
Shizu welcome to my world

whats tekkit?
the jimmies remain unrustled, for now
oh look flim and flam
:)
Oh these guys are epic!
:D
"Just glue some gears to it and call it Steampunk..."
the three emperor year in germany
LeGoMeEGGO: That's the thing: they don't reveal how the trick is done to the audience, to keep them mystified.
best friends or gay lovers?
More like Flim and Flam...in FANCY MODE!
Gentlemen
Tea? not Cider?
why not both Anger
05CriticKitten: itsm ore not to ruin the trick for future performances
british flim and flam
what about cider?
good point
I sorta followed what he was doing myself, though. But damn he was flawless.
i hate biscuits
Im really loving spyro
hmm, FTB looks interesting
Wrek: Yeah, they don't want to spoil it.
I wanted to be a magician when I was younger, but as a dispraxic my skill at sleight of hand can be equatable to that of a bulldozer.
oh dear
TIME TRAVELERS?!?!?
I'm glad we watch g4 ponies because G3 BURNS MY EYES!
TIME POLICE
XIX c. magicians. Hopefully things won't escalate like in "Prestige"...
And I felt like I knew what he was doing, I just couldn't follow it.
This is a great trick
I like their moustaches
I luv eet :)
dat picture frame
Hrm.
I wonder if the guy standing up is giving him tells.
http://i.imgur.com/9aXvQ.jpg
that guy could have a tell
I think I know how this one is done
His fingers
who knew he was thinking of Marie Curie
^^
^^^
The one guy is signaling somehow.
Nyst doesn't seem to be any signals or ear pieces
these hand moves
That's what I spotted :P
giving him some sort of hand signals that only they know, like cathers give to pitchers
broniezrul732, just be warned. There's something from G4 that will burn your eyes, too. Keep asking for ponies, and you'll get what you asked for, but not in any way you would ever want it.
Didn't see it first time watching
alexxm: he can send the tell when he first picks the card
13ENDERMAN IN MAH HOUSE ><
I don't get it
He's signaling somehow.
Time to learn to 3d model.
Shizuka: run
So, what should we talk about?
I just can't tell how. O.o
they should escalate it somehow...
Shizuka: hey can I get your assistance for a moment?
Shizuka, stealin ur blocks?
get in water then look at him.
Shizuka: QUICK TAKE MY SWORD
Shizuka: RUN MOTHAFUCKAH

I havent looked up stuff on ebay lately, theres more collectables for bidding

That's a lot taken of faith. I imagine there's a private conversation after the show.
Oh yeah, the russian roulette
a couple of times
I'm surprised they were surprised.
05my bet they made the move on purpose to distract
Uhm, with nailguns?
oh
You wanna play it right now?
05they probably have certain moves he does
Wrek: ^

THE JIMMIES HAVE BEEN RUSTLED, HALALUAI!

That are really *bang bang*-ing dangerous
Teller makes not giving a fuck and art

So this is a magic show IN a television show.
Hey test
Jonny Woss
Shizuka: indeed, cause then you are either really disapoint at the easiness or amazeed
fools!
sup
i think Penn's magic comes from his epic ponytail
that kids jimmies are somwhat rustled to high heaven
No
huh?
Oh.
how long is each episode
13there's one i've seen of them where they're moving boxes around and bits of teller keep popping out
:D
rdibp: while Teller's comes from his ability to stay stoic
I don't mind not knowing how they do it. It really amuses me to watch magic regardless.
=P
lol
Hi
Wait.
13and it's all hollow inside and he's really working to get from place to place
I don't get it.
His jimmies will pierce the heavens /shot
XD
13loved that video
Bronysith: I'm never disapponted when the trick turns out simple, in fact I usually find it more interesting
no dari
Heheheheh
OUR JIMMIES ARE ETERNAL
http://i.imgur.com/uoGRc.jpg
why is everyone talking about jimmies?
the cardinal sin of ttying to figure out magic tricks is to always overcomplicat it
:<
Because rustling, rdibp
we are the jimmy triumverate~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRmlVEvQO4
I think that a simple trick which looks really amazing is the best kind really.
Jimmies: glorious name
Penn and Teller have a history of revealing how their tricks are done, pisses off the magic circle but it's really interesting.
:I
are your jimmies rustled rdibp?
:T
my jimmies never rustle
learning how easy it is to be so amazingly fooled in a really important lesson :)
Are you sure?
his jimmies are very rustled
rdibps jimmies are stone cold
HUH
/me russtles his terries :O
blarg, caps
in fact, his jimmies just shot through the core
Heres my guess : the "board" is loaded with "nails" the nailgun just makes the sound and has a magnet at the front that pulls up the "nails" . the one he misses is just a blank spot
Socks: That's because the Circle of Magi know what Teller does really is magic.
Because most of my Jimmies do Rustle sometimes
:P
Kammerjunk: True
But I thought mibbit had like a built-in youtube video player thing
I thought it was funny :P

So see ya

Mibbit masks a hostmask?
Maybe not then
Now I have to test again
D:
Nah I checked
I was wrong
lol
Could've sworn it did though

yeah, I thought I remember it being there
that's a dope atari collection
It was useful for learning how to ban people
That would be silly, since the hostmask is designed to mask IPs.

Mother of grapefruit!

That was really good.
good priming XD
FUCKING BRILLIANT
Well we used to use mips, but they're so stupid that they put the stream key in the iframe
The finale was brilliant
So people can jack your stream
DEN OUTTA DEN
The balls vanishing was simple enough, but the oranges popping up out of nowhere?
ahhh
But we tend to use ustream now, yeah
HOW.
HA
Where the fuck did he keep that large thing?
http://i.imgur.com/a2YBC.jpg "soon..."
I was just investigating earlier what it would take to do 1080p stream.
I dont even know.
Jimmies: he he he
I am rather clueless how he got the oranges under there.
LadyCanary: magic *snort* *snort*
are you caught up on episodes now dari?
The guy sure knows how to entertain.
Bronysith: wat
Kammerjunk, O U
Im not, no spoilers.
It takes talent to insult your audience like that.
I've seen some S3 eps
^
you should
But still haven't watched through the rest of S2
you can never really believe when they show you something is empty, because they could just have a mirror in them
Yay!
pfffttt
season 3 has been really good
:D
Awww.
/me applauds.
I just never feel in the mood to watch it anymore
He fooled me, which is enough for me. :P

/me jumps on Wrek and smothers him with kissys
/me kisses back~
He doesn't really look like a Highlander.
05and yes

05i have bought her jewelry :|
Intensity Shuttle for USB 3.0 - $199
/me blushie
;)
HDCP ripper, $299
I swear, when I just glanced at him, I thought about Neil Patrick Harris.
sounds interesting
HE'S THE DOCTOR!!!
Mr_Anybody: YOu just reminded me of someone that rages because he gets killed frequently :D
darling I hope it was FABulous!
would you need both of those things?
I think some of our streamer can stream in 1080p (from PC not from a capture card), but not all our users have good enough internet to view the stream then
daaaahling~
hub - $60
:3
yes
Maybe it was the chin.
streamers*
Chin-boy
thats because ustream has shitty CDN
05i should stream highlander someday
well I was going to say $200 isn't that bad
uhh
am i the only one getting major lag?
heeeeeeeeeeeeere we are
but I don't know about $500
BORN TO BE KING
I dont know if they have POPs in europe.
that's kind of ridiculous
Wrek: Which one? :P
well its equipment you only need to buy once.
No idea what a POP is
there is only one
he sort of looks like David Tennent...or is it just me?
beulsheet
05the one with queen soundtrack

I like that last one
13boolshit, the result of an if statement gone wrong
rdibp: That's probably the Scottis.h
Scottish.*
Wrek: OH GOD PLEASE NO
Shizuka: XD
Nope
05CriticKitten: ikr?
I don't think they care, do they?
We even had a VA from the show on just after we live streamed a new MLP ep
05it still goes on early sunday mornign TV here
they only take stuff down when they have to
OMG! THEY PICKED KENNY
05like 4 or 5 in the morning
13Kammerjunk doesn't realize he chained off my programming pun :)
Degree in bullshit really helps in magician career
They still put that THING on television?
KENNY I LOVE YOU KENNY
is he going to die?
http://i.imgur.com/6K1oz.jpg
rdibp, You bastard!
well we will stream the commercials too so they cant get mad :P
Depends on who, if it's a Viacom network, look out.
ugh, viacom
KENNY! WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE WALKING DEA
DEAD*
yeah, they're pretty awful
05same channel has the first knight rider

viacom rules with an iron fist.
05what else...
05ah yes renegade
/me snickers
Had to check the name because I coudn't remember who it was
I can pretty much say for certain the output from hdmi on a set top box for HD on the hub will have HDCP embedded.

Alright, that's pretty nice.
http://i.imgur.com/2tDiw.jpg
xD
i knew he was going to do that
Well
O_O
....okay.
wut
That was nifty.
Bricks have officialy been shat
he is a witch!
Then, with a proper cdn for video delivery, you could stream in 1080p/720p/480i on the cheap. stream would adapt to whatever the user is using.
so what show is this?
BURN THE WITCH
BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
well if he says so
PONIES
that rarity
this show is photoshop!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8860/
Jimmies: YOU HAVE BEEN R-R-R-R-RUSTLED!!
yay
I see a Rarity ;D
I can see the UI!
WITCHCRAFT
Damn...
Mr_Anybody, Verily
Hmm
Rarity~
Ooh, Rarity's coming along. Seriously though, sleep every once in a while, Wrek.
about a penny a user per hour I would think.
BURN RARITY
no
BURN EVERYPONY
I mean really, it's half past 4 AM, go to bread.
rdibp, i will kill you.
how many users?
burn everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
going to bread?
Kammerjunk: maybe he was so inspired by applebuck season
ok then
It would support as many users as you throw at it.
/me dives into bread
just pay for bandwidth.
damnit, It was 9 pm, then I began watching a new anime, now its 4:30 am
thats how a cdn works.
he sort of looks like kenny from the walking dead
The most we get is on pony eps, which is around 5000+
http://i.imgur.com/xIsI4.jpg if you laugh you are going to hell...nah
Hmm..
Not sure what our max has been
wow
Somewhere around 7000 I think
Hrm
He guided him to the word?
just have everyone donate 10 cents and that would cover all the equipment... :P
gotta catch some sleep before New Year...good night everyone
XD
Night ekips
yeah that is common though i didnt see how he guided him
05good thing im never picked
Hrm, that's interesting though. How'd he guide him to that specific word....?
I could probably make it work.
bye ekips
We don't take donations, people are scared of C&D
imma stay up ALL NIGHT! >:3
05id think of a word like invonurability
ohhh, that's a good point
Night ekips :)
bunneh!
I would think of pony for the lolz
wait
OMG YES
they might not like people charging for their content
I've seen this before
no wait, that's dog
It's neat

Instant stooge principle: Get the person to play along with either a bribe like in a restaurant with the waiter or a blatant asking for helpe like as the person is brought on stage during the clapping acknowledgment.

do the robot
....Justin Timberlake?
Ohai everyone. Ooh, magic! :)
uh....
It is!
so.... where does the magic come in?
Hi Petrified_Discord :)
13less dancing more clothing change
hai Petrified_Discord
yeah it works out to about a cent a user to watch 1080p for 23 minutes.
:)
Teller's looking kind of not indifferent.
Damn
Wow
Must be big.
Less clothing, more dancing!
WAT
I've seen this a couple times...still no idea how they do it
2mbps... that's bad by Swedish standards, isn't it?
....quick changer.
Teller is the not known giver of fucks
wow
...Wrek can't have MY sandwich. I structered after the learning tower of pizza.
Kandarihu: Somewhat bad
which actually adds up.
Dat Queen cover.
05depends
every outfit gets smaller and smaller
Yeah
for both of them
lawlwut
$70 for 7000 users
05how many are watchign stream?
wow
bandwidth isnt cheap.
69
heh
lawl
Wrek: its laggin like crazy
05also my internet supports 100mbps up
thats actually cheaper bandwidth than amazon ec2
Not lagging at all for me.
stream is fine for me.
I'm getting zero lag. >_>
Not lagging for me either.
not lagging here
whcih is $0.05 a gb if i remember right
for me it is ;_;
05it uploading at 2mbps means theres jsut that much data going up
1369 on now
No lag over here :)
what if we threw some ads on the page
zero lag
Man I love bronystate....
986 and 148.
would that cover it?
05then to recieve that you need a cosntant flow of 2mb down
im getting lag
no lag here
fer me it's lagin like crzy, is it because I'm a murican? :(
dat face :D
Just maybe a refferal link to welovefine or some other pony merch site.
Mr_Anybody: murican?
make some comission.
05take it over a giant distance
im on god awful canadian internet, zero lag
'Murica
Their act is cute but it's just one trick over and over.
05so yes there might be some huge lag if youre on a bad connection i
lol
never heard of that place
Hrm, okay that last one sorta threw out my theory.
that's a pretty dress
they have variations in it
o.O
suddenly this song
...Hm.
Jimmies is rustled
:p
I don't get it. My Internet connection supports 15 Mbps up but 50 down.
That one was even better.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcm325wx1U1qjw5mao1_1280.jpg
Ryunosuke, every day
the skirt part of the dress could be folded up over the chest.
let me calculate 720p
burn
lol
true
what does bronystate do again?
is it 720?
are these contests?
Yeah.
kinda
bronystate?
05the ones that manage to fool penn n teller with their magic act
Tear-away clothing.
I'd look up at my logs
05gets to play at their las vegas stage
/me nods.
Lovely act, though.
I'd have to ask the ep streamer
Did make a nice performance though.
but the window got cleared after I parted :P
And they disguised the removal well.
We all stream at different bitrates
720 is about 40% cheaper
05omg these eps are 50 minute each
BUT remember this
05with no commercial
.-.
Well, razzle dazzle them and they'll never catch wise.
O.o
I can make it also support streaming to ipad/iphone/android which is nice
Kammerjunk: ^
benefits of bronystate TV :)
Nice.
in the web browser
oh these guys
are you serious about doing this?
are you talking about livestreaming?
Maybe
so they were wearing clothes under their clothes and were wearing rip away clothing?
Stockgolm Sweden
because it would be pretty awesome
And
swedes
GO SWEDEN!
never heard of them
WOO
First time i've seen em
xD
Mr_Anybody: That's what it seems.
05id say go homeland!
"Very well known in Sweden." "By who?"
but I don't exactly have that kind of money. XD
05but
Havok: have you seen this ep before?
05i dont knwo these guys
^
Brogicians
But it sucks I dont have the hub here at home so I could actually have my equipment here instead of shipping it to someone and having to troubleshoot and set up remotely.
If you can get a post on EQD you should get a fairly good number of viewrs
viewers*
dat hair
I swear, people in Denmark have such strange strange views on the rest of the world. Hell, it's common belief here that Swedish people have hilariously silly accents, but really, they're just less retarded version of Danish accents.
xD
and Im not sure if I will cover my costs.
and what are we watching?
No one currently streams 1080p, do they?
....
O_O
yay, duct tape
ouch
OH NO
I dunno, probably not
if they do then theres no point in me doing it
duct tape <3
Ow.
Well, I hope he didn't need those eyebrows.
thats gonna hurt
:I
This is completely normal in Sweden, don't worry.
....ow.
that would get some attention if you're the only one doing it
yes it is:D
so far it is entertaining
Noone streams 1080p right now.
That's gonna hurt like fucking hell to remove.
I'd say it would be EQD worthy
No, the entertainment comes when that long hair comes the hell out of his head :D
At least, as far as Twitch.tv is concerned.
He had facial hair and everything.
lawl, looks like a public execution
The... I take a nap and THIS is what's on...
haha
xD
13for a..fffarm
XD
Not even the big competitions are in 1080[p
hahaha
like CounterStrike
lel
Sup Everyone
?
lol
-.-
lawl
My home internet wouldnt support 1080p youtube streaming even
XD
Why is it quiet again?
Eh, part of the trick.
alright guys, im back. i had to reset my computer. :)
XD
So much suspense!
it'll be in his mouth or something XD
Hm
I'm pretty sure I get 8mbps
To Everyone That Dosen't Know Me, I Just Became A Brony Yesterday
and probably a decent computer, although stream is automatically transcoded at cdn
Ah.
Upload?
Why not just get a wired connection?
:O
www.speedtest.net
Dayum
wut?
I see it.
?
That was sneaky.
MethGotFlu, why not stop being retarded?
wtf?
not here, I don't know about here

He's like fuck this. xD

usa internet is cheap for good upload though.
D:<
oh god

but I pay for 5mbps for my apartment
In his face?
and supposedly we're actually getting 8
up or down
:D
YUP
My upload is only 2
um
not sure
Is this the illusionist version of Jackass?
13he swapped them out
my upload is 0.3mbps
yeah I saw that too
lolnope
Wow
Kammerjunk: hey, thats what i did when derpyMuffins went sane
13very end it's in his pocket
/me claps
my phone has better internet connection than my home.
bullshit, they probaly had two cards
thelonecubone|GoW3: What is this 'sane' thou speakest of?
LOL
too obvious
lol
I saw that too
Yeah
lol
the card dissapeared behind his hand for a second after he took it out.
Staple gun bit earns them some points :)
13the open hand is always the giveaway
you used to have dialup though :P
Sure, it's a swap-- but it's a HELL of a swap.
I remember that
But once we move my store location im getting the 250mbps down/15mbps up business package.
you might have fooled all of bronystate, but you cant fool me! i listen to public radio.
because we couldn't play Mario Kart :P
Kammerjunk: where people act this so called "normal"
I had dialup up until like 3 years ago.
lol
duct tape, the manly way to shave.
just do it bald
Manliest way to shave: An axe.
thelonecubone|GoW3: Normal? Normal... Eh, sounds delicious!
Id probably also have to get you a little desktop to dedicate to stream transcode and upload...
Manliest way to shave, Legos
I'll have one of that!
no need, just use a shaving knive. It's manly enough
yeah google fiber is cool.
is 16.24 Up/1.54 Up any good?
The first one is down
i use a lightsaber to shave
Aye, It does when it was often to find one
Manliest way to shave. Tweezers?
seems average.
BUSTED
oh
I Was AFK, Sorry
BRB
for equipment itwould probably cost around $800-$1k.
I wanna have better internet.
welp.

13yeah i...
Uh oh.

REally=!
...really?
shows how much we know.
WHAT.
:O
what happend?
<.<
...REALLY?
and internet payment for proper upload.
there had to be a switch
Is it somekind of trick
Shizu, mind blown? :3
it adds up.
Swedes don't lie, their story checks out
YAY!
i bet there was a switch with the scissor handoff
I have the feeling Penn and Teller have a private conversation with everyone who won after the show.
Wait what?
lol, that speed test is taking forever to even start on this laptop
It wasn't a switch :O
13i think they just lied about the switch..
XD
evening everyone
MY FREAKING THING LAGGED AND I COULDNT HEAR THE TRICK :[:[:[
Yep, they are LIERS
Pen And Teller know they switch, but their performance is too good. But they lie.
Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
"selecting best server based on ping"
Liars*
ello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Swedens don't lie, It's a universal fact

Here's my guess: the slap was the exchange point.

Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
P
The middle .
The ball never exsisted!

"could"
The ball is in the Void.

#TheBallIsALie
Heehee
the balls are in my pelvis
I don't know about that... Notch always says that stuff can't be done in Minecraft and then someone makes a mod for it Mr_Anybody...
Petrified_Discord: in other words, it can either be in a b or c
When the guy slapped him in the head, he quickly grabbed the back of his head and rubbed it hard. I think that's when they passed the card.
05Stallion_of_War: notch is a cheap fuck
and now it locked up my browser
/me choose b
so sad

Not sure how he got it into his mouth, though.

hey
digital music
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878203648/h3BC868B4/
is TELLER TALKING!?!?!?! a:O
By taking Penn to the stage he reduce the chance two magicians notice his trick.
?
The only one Teller talks to is Penn. He whispers sweet nothing in Penn's ear.
ha
I'm still amazed he slipped a wrapped deck of cards in between his hands.
JRP2234 XD
did u grab MineCraft
uh
hi?
Without him catching it.
Kammerjunk, How romantic of him
lol
Jim: It's because Penn is His chosen prophet.
YAY
So they saw the trick beforehand?
:D
Highlight spam much?
Told ya
Nyst: Only part of it.
So they caught the deck switch, but not the card.
YES
that guy is the master magician, penn admitted it
The best part is left undiscovered.
Off to Vegas with you!
Hoho.
TAKE MAI MONEH
That's ballsy enough to bring Penn up close too.
Meth does this all the time
Jaysus!
Shut up and take my magic!
but he thought he can do that
I have an idea
Yea?
Okay, yeah, that was really impressive.
It's basically. 'We know everything you did! Everything! except... the important bit."
when you spam like that we should just not say anything
Yeah, the card swap is what baffles me.
yeah
so then you will have to come up with an actual conversation topic
:P
dat ;)
swag
ah cubar
So, what is yoru favorite game ever?
To be fair I didn't say anything
How he got the card into a SEALED and WRAPPED new deck is....
CriticKitten: Well, they both saw that, probably happened when he was talking about the tricks he could do.
hm... Scarface?
So this is all on you guys
:P
Ah, komrade

CriticKitten: Absolutely razzle-dazzling.

Hah
Lol
they like it so much they think everyone else in the world wants to hear it
Nope.
Whoa, so do I^^
And no one knows where the staples came from. They some how hit them in the back of the head.

hmm its easy, there wasonly three staleps in the gun.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You stapled my father. Prepare to die.
I like 80s and country music

I like dubstep and drum and bass
twilight_sprinkle: are you a wizard
I like everything, except dubstep, and country
05ive done that
I also like J-pop
05but into my thumb
He's got a way to tell which one is loaded, beyond the weight.
nah he just seems liek a comedian :D
I believe you have my stapler.
I saw Iron Maiden in concert, pretty cool.
kind of a guilty pleasure
not really getting anything here
hhahaa
theyre all loaded but they have safeties
Hah, parental guidance.
cuban staplette
and then he died
13russian roulette doesn't seem much like a magic trick as it is having safeties
Shizuka: My name i-i-s Milton Waddams and th-they took my stapler.
what is jpop?
Japanese Pop
Wrpng messgaes all over-- and I can see so many ways it can be done unless...
I explained this before lol
XD
I'm dying!
13canary we should burn the building down
wait, are those staplers or nail guns?
oh yeah.
hahaha
I heard some JMetal, pretty good
staples

:P
Buytoast: industrial strength staples
lol
:3:3:3:3
pirate metal?
ah
much less scottish?
13thicker coaster
/me yawns
lol
russian roulette isn't about probabilities or chance, it's about how stupid you are to play any kind of game with a weapon, especially a loaded one.
prepuh tu duuuuur
Sumi! :3
I'm Back!
heh
Hrm...
sup man
:O
Back from me rather juicy melon.
Arrow roulette is just how willing you are to lose an arrow.

13different friend
so she could tell us about not labeling music with genres
I might be AFK again
:P
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why am i so bored
XD
oh she >.< sorry
prepeah to dieeaaah

Because I have to fix my desktop
ded
ded
oh it's okay
Seriously, arrows get lost like you don't even know.
Barbetos: ill help you not be bored
RIP teddy bear ;_;
names ending with o tend to be male
So you'd be forgiven for making the mistake
:P
wonder if those are real
It must be the.. bored... wood? HA
I realized that there is much less guys in the Spyro Community, so I should just call everyone I dont know, a girl.
hmm the gun was amrked thats why he placed it to the side
staple guns are not the best medium for a magic trick
Okay that was dum
Is there a special way to fire the stapler?
So... He forced a stapler. Not a card. Not a coin. A STAPLER. That is impressive.
and she has her gender on the forum set to male
Nice performance but boring.
Very nice.
lol
why?
I didn't like it
Meth: thats a good idea
:D
I hoped he will come up with a surprise at the end
yup :p
HA
XD
lol
he stretch it a little bit too much.
to throw off the anonymous trolls from years ago I think
I'm blatantly a girl
XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD
I have to admit....it is rare to have a chat room with girls
LOL dari
I have no idea what was going on really
He's got a way to tell which one's loaded.
ughhhh hello bronystate
hi Quick_Thinker
hey Quick_Thinker!

Dark souls is getting to difficult :l
duh

Barbetos: cuban rollette

13yeah i think you could easily have a tell on the loaded stapler and just modify the trick realtime
i'm closer to 2013 than most of you :P
muhahahhaa
Hey
hey Everto
Implying Dark Souls isnt already difficult.
Oh
Quick_Thinker: Go get some rest and play it fresh later.
Hi Everto
since we're talking about genders
oh yeah its almost 2013
only 25 hours :3
LOL

CriticKitten: That's not the trick, the trick is how he made her pick the right one.
yay
Yeah.

:P
Quiz Me Also.

hahahaha
sorry
Kencolt: Yeah.
Lol

So back to my question
grab a random ponce
/me is unable to locate this ping
man, this reminds me of that time i won a years supply of lo'real kids shampoo from a rugrat's play
payable to me of course
he didnt even show a number
he grabed his best france
Can you peer to peer stream a movie?
cause i had the winning ticket under my seat
NAAAAAAAAAIL
I think Penn and Teller also review their showmanship skill.
Who here has played the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim?
is it wrong to be upset by some drawing that feature someone holding a violin with the right hand?
i've got a golden ticket
i like his hair
btw, God, it's /nick to change your name
CrystalPhoenix, Maybe they're left handed?
CrystalPhoenix: What if the violinist is left handed?
i leik his mane :3
is this guy a magician or a mathmatician?
:P
So many numbers
I felt bad leaving him out
Twilight is turned on somewhere right now becuase of this guy.
just don't make me regret this :P
Well
/me slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
O_o
thx
what is this place, filled with so many numbers
this guy wears his sunglasses at night
I've never seen a violinist holding the violin with his right hand
The black guys hands are a different colour to his face
never ever ever
sukker
im not a fuckin mathmatican or a checkbook your on your own
Some people play play guitar differently too.
don't change your name every 5 seconds or anything
or we will have problems
ok
Chicago is the greatest destination
LooF, That is actually very common
Viewers?
yeah
Woah, that's a helluva audience participation
we can also set a mode that prevents non-ops from changing their nicks
or was i right?
:o
Jim- watch
SirGanjalfTheGreen: Showmanship need variations too.
oh
this guys got a lot of charisma
i was wrong lol
wow
:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
Hrm.
Hahaha

WITCH CRAFT BURN HIM AT THE STAKE
Bronysith: dude, sorry had to wander off for something
transsexual.
that wouldn't make sense
He's doing this all off-stage? This is pretty impressive actually.
someone said he was a girl a few days ago
quit saying my name stream
ffs
they were probably messing with you
Barbetos :D
Barbetos: why?
he changed it
Barbetos: Go to bed, Johnathan
as a joke
:o
Or Ross.
Whichever.
Barbetos_Jonathon
I used to call him that and he would get mad at me
It did it again
CriticKitten: thats what he want syou to thinkl
oh
We get a fair number of Russians as well
EVIL EVILLLLL....
numbers game?
does not seem legit
BURN TEH WITCH
13well i dunno about forcing the tshirt but the numbers could just be math
And just Europe in general
Ponies live stream, after 5 minutes it tells you to pay $2. :P
Lawl
no first we need to find a duck
Is that psyhic paper from Doctor Who?
wut?
that's just cruel
suddenly Nirvana
NIRVANA
the XD
what
kanye west?
Nirvana awesome
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
wait
it takes long enough to find the episodes as it is
whoa
what
.......
Hahaha!
I still think you should cut to G3.5 half way through the ep
:P
:o NIRVANA
hmm?
Amazing!
WTF
So many delicious tears
:P
lol
wut

Wait.
O_O
Awesome

WHAT!
That was absolutely marvelous.
WHAT
:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
13okay so
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT GUY
AMAZING
lel
Now that's SHOWMANSHIP!
whaaaaaaaaat!
OK... that was BRILLIANT.
WHAT DID I JUST SAY
i knew he looked sketchy...
And of course, Teller still isn't impressed.
13the numbers in the bowl do not match his
didn't he choose his own destination though?
thats a high-quality mask
whoever spotted the hands was on to something
nonetheless: MIND = BLOWN
then...all of that was for naught, just a disguise trick....clever yes but...
REPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAYREPLAY
This infrastructure would allow you to host and stream everything all episodes on demand
why nirvana
but it might get expensive if you got a lot of traffic
I WANT TO REPLAY
Hah
i mean its good but still
Quick_Thinker because 90s
haha
lol
Wait, wait, wait. The volunteer wasn't the person who decided that he should be the other volunteer.
Wait, would you be gaining money if u livestream?
Let's have another look on that
13ah thus the sunglasses
lawl
the hell?
Yep
13cause the eyes would be a dead giveaway
google must have such a low negotiated interconnect rate with other datacenters.
...
WAT!?
that was fucking clever, but it probaly wasnt live
PEEEEEELING OOOOOOF MY SKIIIIIIIN
Mission Impossible trick right there.
for youtube.
THESE MAAAAGIC TRIIIICKS ARE REEAAAAAL
only 25 hours, 29 minutes till 2013 :3
So the guy with the number just coincidentally chose Leewoy (or whatever) as the second volunteer?
Kammerjunk: yeah
Buytoast: of course there are, there magic tricks :P
soooooo anyone want to help me kick those 2 bosses ass in Anor Londo in Dark souls
Lmao
Kammerjunk: Penn nonetheless
dun dun dun dun dundun
Java: Well, Penn chose the other guy. That guy then chose Leewoy.
:I
Teller knoooooows.
LadyCanary: You can tell by his face, eh?
Aw daaaamn
Man... with 7000 viewers you would suck 1tb of bandwidth in like a minute.
13yep!
BUSTED
sluurrrrppp all gone.
Oooh.
D:
For a moment i thought "This black guy is a fake" but i had no idea it could be him
Bingo!
that is just insulting.
Oh!
:D
nooooooo
Nice job, though.
it was a good trick
No wait, those are poker chips.
So, what are we watching anyway?
i'd totally agree
Not bingo.
was an impressive trick though
so he passed?
no he failed
oh
alright, goodnight everypony
He did well, but he didn't fool them.
but he did good
Rewindddd
Would you really get 7k viewers streaming ponies or helis?
Nope, didn't fooled them
and more skin peeling
wat
huh?
yes.
so ummmm is Bronystate going to stream animaics when it goes on
yo dawg
wat
13it's so picture in picture :)
05realyl authentic
i herd u like watever is hapening right now
Would you do it all for free, or some partnership thingy?
Whatthehellception
It's a hell of a mask-- you have to give him that.
That was a fun trick at least.
Wrek: um are you skipping or is it my video acting up?
free
no one wants to pay for anything.
Kencolt: If Ross didn't notice it, yeah.
:o
vegas hmmm im a minor soooo unfortunitly vegas sucks for me
13actually once he's up there the second time, you notice his face doesn't hardly move
I hope he got a chance to perform in LV. His showmanship is excellent.
Follow the Queen.
otakon it was such a good disguise
Stalk her.
05otakon: was replayign a segment
ah
He can entertain people well.
BBB
it's C
C
Psh.
remember, p.o.o.p.!
SEE!?\
inb4 not C
He said no trick, so b?

Buy some apples!
night all
I LOVE THIS DOCTOR!
13it's not 100 needles
no
gnight
Quick_Thinker: Its ok :)
13not six feet either
don't lie Shizuka
>_>: What in tarnation he done to that apple?
Penn would never steer us wrong
he throws the apple down and make the volunteer pick them up at gun point
Teller is really good at what he does. Pure visual storytelling, it is.
i want to seem some one shoot them selves in the head and be unscaved
AMAZING!!
thanks
night
Applejack's nightmare
night
dont let the bed bugs bite
no one commenting, so tende
the tension!
tense
The sound of silence.
nom
Let them bite
._.
O_O
nomnomnom
Well
It's easier to get rid of them when they think there's a meal
yum...?
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Teller doesn't talk.
Don't be mean.
O_o
lol
13dat grin
like a frog
this trick is really a nail biter
Kammerjunk: nah he's just a bawss
yummy needles
Bet that must taste... spicy.
I have seen this before
LORD.
Buytoast: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
D:
Buytoast, dohoho'
those nails are cake!
:O
13they're falling into his collar
Ugh. ._.
so okay im a bit dense is teller a mute
O_o
This trick is kinda hard to swallow...
If you're trying to exterminate bed bugs, do not stop sleeping in your bed
eats the thread, pulls it out and will have all the needles on it
Quick_Thinker: nah it's an act
this trick will have you sitting on pins and needles
13Quick_Thinker: no just doesn't really talk to people other than penn
It may sound weird, but it's the best way to kill them
Eddmario: We need to digest it slowly
are those spikes even real?
I don't see the point of this trick
but who wants to sleep with bugs in their bed? D:
Yep
Which I think in itself is amazing.
I can't stomach this trick!
C'mon Teller
don't choke
O_o
so is like a zenophobic person to everyone but pen
Well you can either deal with it for a week
Jim: AHAAHAA, MY SIDES. AAAAHAHAHAHAHA
the trick is, theyre made of crackers!
Or wait a month and deal with it for a couple more weeks
Ad....why?....
xD
This is, in fact, one of the classic illusions-- and no, I don't know how it's done. I've just seen it before. Although, not with as many needdles.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAHAHAAA
MissVenom: Adblock
Or you could burn the bed and sleep on the floor
MissVenom: get adblock or ghostery
Catch some apples!
They go into hibernation if they can't find food
Be my dentist, sir!
xD
say "AH"
:D
ehehe
awkward
colgate would be scared
Hahahaha
:D
twilight_sprinkle: :O, so that's why he didn't di... I mean use it to sew clothes <_<
XD
lol
ha
Hehehee
Some news on the gaming front
hes hiding them in his cavities!
he just used the greeting of my people!
for any that were waiting for the PvP of Diablo 3
otakon: What is it otakon ?
what is that news otakon
Well, at least Teller isn't scared of going to the dentist.
they canceled it
Oh god, this is making the flem from my cold/flu/pnumonia bunch up in my throat...
Yes! DIE EVERTO!
DIE!
that's old news
otakon: Not interested
....no
No way.
INB4 needles.
OM NOM NOM, OM NOM
pootis
otakon: WUT
Lol
I prefer Torchlight.
SANVICH!
:D
ehhh never played blizard games for a eason dont want to get sucked into them
I don't like where this is going
Okay folks! Thats all!
/me blends otakon
Why did you let him eat all that!?
RaveBrony: yeah for the time being they cancelled the PvP for Diablo 3
is he gonna puke up a sweater?
twilight_sprinkle: Hah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
wat
.....OH WHAT
HORY SHET
LIVE EVERTO!
otakon: Thats a shame........ :(
you know, that doesn't really even do anything
oh
:O
:P
LIVE!
woah
oh nonono
WHAT THE HELL
Whattttt?
Teller does not give a single damn.
Quick_Thinker: originally the games WEREN'T "always online" bullshit
:p :p :p
I hate needles on mouth
The silent master.
DEMON MAGIC
now thats a sharp trick
neato
you can still talk with voice
....wut .-.
no +m right now
Without
WE'RE NOT WORTHY
$170 for 10TB of bandwidth
right
he had god mode on
withougt
thats a pretty good deal
13WITCH
*without
for cdn bandwidth
Teller really does not care. He just kind of sighs, thinking to himself "Really? That's all it takes to impress you lot?"
WITCHCRAFT
SCREW THEM, I'M GONNA TRY IT AT HOME
Psh. He's always in god mode.
Dat baby aj
he has a pocket in his toung
I can't even pretend to know how he did that.
Suddenly baby applejacl
I don't even have the first clue.
ah shiii its 12 :l
well time for riftraxx
Quick_Thinker: As in midnight?
As I said-- a classic, been done for years, but I myselfr don't know HOW.
hey everypony whats going on?
Just give her the apple fritter, and no one will die of sugar overload
JUST DO IT
hai AssertiveFluttershy
lali-ho AssertiveFluttershy
Im appojack. Mo appol fwedder>
Hm, I'd make a very lame Star Trek joke using your name here Jim, but I can't think of anything...
AssertiveFluttershy: hello, just missed some good magic show
Eddmario, I'm dead, me.
Well, the fact that he never speaks might help him in that one
Yay
This stream is already awesome
That was fun.
tahnks for the stream Wrek
...
PONY
NEW PONY
yeah I saw the announcer guy from penn and teller
WOO
:)
Oh, 720p stream.
O_o
ah, the test ep
The part that gets me is that he has the guy check his mouth to prove they're not there. So the needles couldn't have gone down his throat to start with. But then where'd he stash them? o.
suddenly pony
ponies on bronystate?
*o.O
oh, the new horse again?
13i see artifacts around the lines
New ep? o3o again?
Oh wow, I haven't seen this one yet
DAT 720
Shizuka: I noticed those too in my rip I just got
Yay, HQ
LOL Bon bon's offical name is Sweetie drops
anything thouse guys can do I can do also
holy carpe diem, 720p
newest ep?
heh, there's a gay marriage thread now on spyroforum
Carpe noctem!
spike has a foot fetish
I feel like that's kind of asking for disaster
eeyup
ew
PonyGuyRulz really now?
Dat fluttershy and the dog in the background. (what's applejack's dog's name?
just notied fluttershy walking winona
loves the smell of dirty feet
RDash5000: and mane
fluttershy walkin aj's dog?
It's pretty gross he gets off on that.
yeah
KrazyNoobs: Winona
Deacon: Yeah
Spike has limited list-making skills compared to... you know who.
but since we are kind of low on traffic
otakon: Aw, thanks
but I'm gonna see where it goes
let it ride.
yeah
:P
I like this episode, because it has Applejack being a badass.
considering how little data is actually streaming, I will approve of this quality.
damn you buffer and np KrazyNoobs
thats bad of me to say.
My little LAG!
:P
what the hell?
Doctor whooves offical name is Time Turner
05its a 720p stream
yet you didnt let my campaign thread stay :p
05ofc it will lag for some
Well, it's 15 minutes to 6 AM. I don't know how Wrek does it, but I might as well just not sleep.
It's just in the spam section
05what im tryign to test is the quality
P0N3: I think you mean because it has CGI timber wolves in it.
Seriously Applejack is a TOTAL badass with those timberwolves.
I know Wrek
honestly, totally forgot there was an episode this week
I would have let it stay.
Quality is lovely.
I don't delete threads
its in 720p? i thought i would get lag
PonyGuyRulz: Actually they change it again to Dr Whoof.
so, who owns that balloon anyway?
lol, should I move it back?
Blam.
Call your ISP and complain that you are getting laggy pony
Faceplant.
Java: That's good
RDash5000: Cherry Picker
To tell the truth, I disliked the episode. I liked Spike as a character, but this proved him to be a huge tool. Hopefully, they can fix him in a future episode.
They will fix the issue right away.
yeah
probably not now because it'll be all spammy
RDash5000: It's owned by the city.
RDash5000: It's Celestia's. If she finds out, she'll send Spike to roast in a volcano for 1000 years.
Baby dragons sure are made of tough stuff.
Java: that makes sense
Because fate is a cruel mistress.
05try fullscreening
Kammerjunk: he doesn't roast remember?
thats the best knot ever made if it can be unknotted when spike its it
Spike can bathe in magma. He wouldn't care.
delete all Meth 's threads.
otakon: Teller dammit.
05id liek soem feedback on that
evening all
hits*
I only have 2 threads
the timberwolves still look too out of place to me
Dat CGI...
see, here it is http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12946-vote-breaking-bad-for-moderator.html
I am watching in FS. looks pretty good Wrek
Wrek: lookin' good on my end :)
suddenly 3d
Wrek, Full screen is great
hello new animation test
The Timberwolves seem to pretty much be golems.
and only 3 times the normal stream data also. very nice
eww 3d
05id prefer them to have used flash like normally for those super advanced animation moves the wolves have
its not so bad
Wrek, Fullscreen looks brilliant, not getting much lag either
Deacon: Technically, the Timber wolves in this episode weren't the first time 3D was used in the show...
Who enchants those timberwolves, that's what I want to know.
05but i also realize the shitload of work that would go into it
05so i can compeltly understand why they went with it
I like well done 3d work.
Gonna toggle it full screen
^
05but i dont like it
the amount of work is the only reason it doesn't bother me too much
but still
oh boy, here we go....
dat hug
They were reduced to using 3D.
yeah those 3d models look too... 3d-ish
I like how the CG is understated.
:P
WOOKIE LIFEDEBT!
Timber wolves should be a conjuration summon in Skyrim
Well, computer-generated imagery isn't exactly as rough as it used to be.
And to be fair, the show is Flash. Flash has 3D.
DO NOT WANT CG
Spike is Chewbacca, AJ is Han Solo
Kammerjunk: still looks weird
ya its not like he accidently unknotted it
okay, cool
Bye Cherry Picker
hopefully it works out
You guys do realize that _all_ of mlp is cg, right?
I actually think the 3D was used to pretty good effect.
It does look strange now that you mention it
otakon: yea no
Bronysith: It does have an obvious difference when put in a Flash show.
Bigcheese: eeyup
Bigcheese: yeah but it's 2D flash compared to 3D flash
Kammerjunk: which makes it stick out and look gross
if spike works all day writing and carrying heavy objects, why is he so clumsy?
Although they could have done this episode a lot better. We rarely get a Spike episode, and it was handed over to Merriweather.
Bigcheese computer graphics, yes
otakon: yes.
Bronysith: she's CHERRY PICKER!
Woah, wha?
otakon: you made a bad star wars reference
damn that's a big sow
I don't care what they use as long as it looks good, and I think it looks great.
otakon: prepare to be assimilated
if spike works all day writing and carrying heavy objects, why is he so clumsy?
Bronysith: wait NO
just seems lazy AJ. Dropping it down there like that.
Pigglet Sparkle
lol
How did he clean it? he knocked the bucket over
Spike is used to working in a library.
I don't own it
man they really did turn Spoke into a bumbling dingus in this new horse
I don't get clumbsy spike.
You all watch ponies?? Eeeeewwww
Hi RaveBrony
dat AJ
is ADORABLE
RaveBrony, Ewww, nooo
Hey KrazyNoobs :)
er Applebloom actually
I forgot that Honey Boo Boo had a small cameo during this scene...
dammit I'm tired
/me takes otakon away
Hrm. I wonder. It may be a computer issue too.
He is fully capable of cleaning Twi's crap.
lol
lol disclaimer on the bottom
how is spike better as twilights assistant than applejack
and then the pig got dirty again
XD
He does mess up every so often.
but we would be their competition
he's too excited
Bigcheese, he worked in a library.
Some compies can't handle 720 at all
does ustream let you do multi resolution, Wrek?
Twi has a spell on him
THAT is why he's acting up
Well, the thing is that Spike is used to working for a Mane character. Must be strange working for a background pony.
PIES
nah we can work together or something.
Kammerjunk O U
I know livestream will if you have an upgraded account
anton: Magic. No, srsly, that's the only logical explanation
05the_real_pony_1604: nope
Tabitha awesomeness
or tell them to pound sand and do our own thing. either way.
damnit spike
I also think this episode lacked character.
I agree
Or, at least, wrecked spike's character
I doubt Spike has cooked more than popcorn in his life. Twilight doesn't seem like the type to cook more than toast for breakfast, herself.
Bro Code
Any computer than can't handle 1080p is pretty lame.
this episode also lakced being good
You just made that up, didn't you Spike?
SirGanjalfTheGreen: maybe.
Rarity's character was spot on :3
should we register a domain and stuff?
05Bigcheese: its a connection issue
not now
Twilight when she's reading = me when gaming
05and to be frank
Wrek: and hence not a computer issue.
because whenever I register a domain that signals the end of a project
05internet is veeeery young
Pinkie was the only character that I liked in this ep.
P0N3: I know, I don't get all the fics where Spike is a master chef.
I love this part.
and I get bored and do something else
05you cannot expect everyoen to have fast speeds
mhmm
She's like, "Not now Spike, doing books."
lol
I have so many domains that I register then I get bored and not finish it.
that library has the most confusing door ever.
mhmm
lol this is my third time watching this today
1080 isn't the problem, connection speed is a big part of it and then alot of monitors max out at 1440x900
Spike as a master chef? I'd like to read those!
well that update killed optifine
sounds like everything I ever try to do
Damn Twi..... ouch.....
P0N3: Every. Single. HiE. Ever.
that poor kitchen
I think I win.
I promise NO TAXES, and I will ban Afflict I will also give Drugs to the Children! Also, I am the sexiest one here!
Well, that's a lie, there are some good HiE fics.
"Whatever. I can ask Celestia to send me another slave any time."
Foreeeever
Yeah I don't get very excited about reading HIE fics.
05i liek AJ's faces in this one
the poor pie
Hahaha
HE HAS A BUSINESS CARD
You can give me one of the Domains :p
two aj episodes in a row?
I get too many ideas and always finish stuff 50%
seriously he HAS A BUSINESS CARD
Well if we have some kind of partnership I'm sure we wouldn't mind helping with a stress test, but if you're setting up as competition they probably wouldn't be so keen to help. :P
good job hasbro
best aj faces in this episode.
The only thing I liked in this episode was the stache.
OK, you get "methisdumbdumb.com"
oh Lord
A business card in crayon. XD
I do?
There are several HiE fanfic that actually worth the read.
This is more of a spike episode, with AJ roped in.
otakon: Oh my Teller... It even has a WATERMARK!
not the AXE!!!
Can you make it a .edu domain?
maybe
Java: have you read Hands?
SirGanjalfTheGreen: lol
I like to see more AJ, so Im fine with it
still, more aj sreen time
yes to Rarity
Ha ha loved Applejack's nonchalance there.
The borin one usually consist of brony came to Equestria.
methisdumbdumb.edu
poor Rarity
this episode has so much fan canon possiblities in it
screen
I need to find a way to monetize the stream
Yep
interesting
Arrow 18. Read that. HiE, but differnt and believea ble.
and we KNOW SPike can bake
Anger like?
i bet applejack is enjoying this part
without making hasbro angry.
at least the worst horse has to eat bad pie
he mades those cookies
only good HiE fic I know of is the voltaire one
lol
I bet Applejack enjoyed that.
05a good HiE is TTEOAP
Also, when the "fight" scene came up, I was hoping they wouldn't stuff it up like Twi vs. Ursa Minor or Twi vs. the three headed dog.
nom
RDash5000: Yeah. Interesting read. Not the best but silly.
She doesn't seem fond of Rarity.
the fanfics are being writen as we speak
lol
Title it "Big Ponies Vol. 1"
I can hear teh pens scribbling
05i dont like many fics
Bringing back the Spike love?
Odd
05the ocne i can manage to read are crossovers
If Rarity doesn't know Spike likes her, she is dumber than derpy
05prefferably sci fi
slave driver
OK wtf... http://i.imgur.com/bTSGY.gif
of course rarity would like an assistant
Java: Hell, my current favourite fic is a brony coming to Equestria. The difference is that it has originality. That, and character and world building.
Forever in her debt. Isn't she just awful.
Oh Rarity <3
originality
typical Rarity
AND cahracter?
The good one is when an astronaut crash landed on Equestria.
so he's.../
AND ORIGINAL CHARACTER?
Also, I love this reference
See, this is what I'm telling you. Rarity is such a dom.
Kammerjunk: Title?
lol, well put
SLAVERY!
Java: good read
What IS it with Rainbow Dash and windows.
wait
how is a broom going to help clean out soap
self-insert fics are now canon.
...
.....
I want to read that fanfic.
unfinished novels?
uh
She's always peeping and interjecting into conversations through windows.
Buytoast: Terribly, innit?
FANFICS?!
RD visiting Rarity?.....Nope O_o
FANFIC JOKES!?
no idea
^
dont ask.
XD
But yeah, am I the only one who actually likes fandom-pandering?
Oh, so that's where "felind disrepect from behind" comes from
KrazyNoobs: hell no
i'd buy that novel id RD wrote it
If you know what she means
Rainbow Dash is a total peeping Tammy.
KrazyNoobs: I;m okay with it.
if*
relevant: http://i.imgur.com/Djuk3.png
inb4 secret but fun
how old do you think the mane six is
P0N3 you want the truth? Merchandising!!
/me dat clear stream
lol
lololol
KrazyNoobs what exactly is pandering to?
She makes money
Java: Love Mine, it's on FiMFiction. Was one of the first Changeling fics I read, lots of theory-building about Changelings.
XD
pfft I make towers of stone all the time...
Deacon: stuff only the older more involved fans wuold get
What does Rainbow Dash peeping have to do with merchandizing? They can bring her into the episode lots of ways.
what did spike do in the kitchen to knock off the pipe
it's Tom's family reunion!
Poor Rarity :I
otakon: xD
otakon ha
i wanna rock
there is no good news
how come spike is good at being twi's assistant but not AJ's
Imma throw together a stream test
Java: I'd recommend waiting, though. Bit of a gap between updates, but it does happen every blue moon.
shouldn't be a problem, she kicked down trees
Kammerjunk: I think I remember that one. It's about a changeling after the battle of Canterlot right? I don't know....
Two family records in a row? That's a record!
and you can all watch it and see if it works
steampunk is still bleh
She has a peter pan complex with windows
steampunk is cool
SirGanjalfTheGreen: holy steampunk!
yay
I'm Finally Back!
TOM!
Java: check out Into The Black: A Mare's Tale. Kinda poor start, but it gets REALLY great!
BUt yeah, they shouldn't have wrecked spike in this episode.
flying up to them
spike is the new apple jack
I'm gonna write a comic now. Rarity takes out a restraining order against Rainbow Dash.
peeping in
or wahtever.
Within 50 feet of her residence.
k
I'm back everyone!
Smash into rocks! so good
Java: No, but it talks about it.
and RD had to go back to the hospital
ded
Kammerjunk: I see
Fics need more peeping Rainbow.
Dragon dance
05spiek sure can handle the mares~
PonyGuyRulz: Yep
dem lags
Spike wants to be a nobel dragon
Why exactly does Spike have a sudden obsession with work?
Dragon Code
Inflation is now canon
found it, paranoid android by radiohead
:[
spike can sing
Panic
AJ is full of hot air.
the fuck
PonyGuyRulz: Wern't you one of the people that told me about ponies and the bacics of bronystate
...
STOP THAT ANIMATORS STOP IT!
/me shudders
OCD
Hah Twi's OCPD.
otakon: Hmm?
LOL
CriticKitten because merrieter
apparently
I worried about Twilight
/me eats a random sandwich
I loved that AJ face
RaveBrony: inflation... saw it on TechTV once... kind of creepy
's OCD
otakon: Oh :I
the easiest way to break twilights focus
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
FFS I need to upgrade my TV package to get the Hub in HD
OCPD - Obsessive Compulsive Pony Disorder :$
I remember stumble upon an inflation fanfic for ponies on FFnet. It's... weird.
I'm listening to music on my apple tv
knock over the ink holder thingy
It's so important that we've never mentioned it in the show before now, despite showing dragons on multiple occasions!
counting blades of grass
best parte
Hahaha
I love pinie! XD
isk whats it called
lol dat Pinkie
idk*
heheheheh
Gotta love Pinkie
:)
Pony: People Obviously Not You
pinkie*
what....an elaborate plan pinkie
Yeah Spike is accustomed to Twilight's OCPD.
WE LOVE YOU PINKIE!
Doesn't even question counting grass.
mmmmustache
YES
Pinkie you can ONLY wear a mustache if it comes in pink
If Spike breaths fire... couldn't they just burn the TIMBERwolves?
oh God
OH GOD
Dammit let her wear the moustache!
So what are you doing, i have no clue
Pinkie looks actually pretty good with the mustache
Rarity is the only good part of this episode.
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER SEALAB 2021?
pinkie's mustache of evil
AJ, you suck.
I think many ponies are good in this.
Rarityyyy <3
I love this part
Yes
no party canon
Is that the first time Twilight teleported where the camera didn't follow her?
Epic part :D
AJ acting was hilarious
otakon whats that?
lol
Bad acting :)
Anybody else notice there's been leaks for almost every episode this season?
Barbetos: oh lord I'll have to show you
Hoooooo
RD "roar" is funny
but I just got an idea for a short
i know what it is actually XD
otakon: if i remember correctly, It aired during Adult swim?
FS is cute with her "clopping"
At least this scene is full of originality. Reminds me of Season 1 a bit. :)
RD can be a VA
Just never really watched it properly.
Maybe that's what Applejack is really like in distress.
thelonecubone|GoW3: eeeeeeeeeyup
1080p pony stream
Isn't that a weird thought?
AJ is many things. A good actor isn't one of them.
just testing a stream thing.
hopefully
inb4 <_< >_> <_< spam
ok
JEssus
wat is rd
Applejack is tough. Being in distress, for her, is just being annoyed.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #45
doohoohoohoohooohoomed
lol pinkie
RD is best SFX pony
otakon: I love that show as a kid, even thou i didnt understand most of the suggetid part back then
how the hell does RD do that roar?
Too casual.
Barbetos: there is a scene where Murphy has a moustache and he's getting on with the blonde and he's like "You want the mustache on or off?" "off please" .... "too bad"
suggested*
thats the best timberwolf ever
just replace the visuals with Pinkie and AJ
lol
Anger from pinkie of course
She can howl like a boss.
<_<
nom
XD
OH COME ON AJ!
Dat voice
Aj... just, no.
wut
brb, Match >:3
jeez RD...what a roar....
Rainbow Dash needs her own black metlal band.
worst play ever i want my money back!!!!
That's bad and you should feel bad!
:O
Well, looks like Spike didn't got Fooled. No Vegas for you, Applejack>_>
Poor acting ruins the day
big fat phony
DOES NOPONY RELIZE THAT WOOD IS FLAMMABLE, AND THAT SPIKE IS A WALKING FLAMETHROWER???? :[
but you forgot that the timberwolves were made in 3d flash, not 2d!
But yeah, another thing I hate about this episode is how they make Spike stupid
Rainbow Dash is best metal growling pony.
death comes
did she just blink in the same spot as spike?
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
05note that the huge timberwolf is in flash
love how twi just leaves spike to die
what the hell is that kind of design?
05due to not havign to run
surprised that did not explode him or something
ow
Is it me or was that 'ow' undeniably unbrearably cute?
Decepticon
Yay, Spike will finally learn a lesson
oh sheet its the 31st.
time for most epic villain death ever
Okay you know what?
One thing I hate about the show itself is that it sets up a good fight scene to occur, and then they make it gay. aka. Twi vs. Ursa Minor, Twi. vs three headed dog, or this.
Yeah Applejack doesn't do 'distress'.
Choking!
its meh bday :D
Barbetos: She did. Perhaps teleportation creates an expanding bubble at the exact middle of the destination.
im real life if timberwolves were real a rock wouldnt stop them
nomm
holy crap, a super timberwolf
Skill Shot!
Choking!
worst. boss fight. ever.
Timber Wolves must be the glass cannons of Equestria
insta kill
seriously they fought a MANTICORE and didnt' flinch
THEY COULD HAVE DONE THIS WAY BETTER. :[ :[
Victory!
CRIT HIT!
/me Dear Princess Celestia, Today I didn't learn to use my fire breath to burn highly flammable monsters. You're faithful student, Spike
they faced a DRAGON and didn't run
double points
ded
three timber wolves show up and they all scatter like leaves
They HAD to face those things though otakon
The Timberwolves is Engish :p
was
It would have been hilarious if he incinerated that thing and sent it straight to Princess Celestia.
Plus, spike should have burped fire at them.
KrazyNoobs: its not a show about cool fight scenes though
;): A ROCK?! That's his weakness?
I would run like hell from 3 timberwolves
05FS is good with wood?
RaveBrony: good point but they still FOUGHT WITH A MANTICORE
05what?
wait
So... Was that the story of that guy and Goliath?
FS wants to be a tree
Princess Celestia, reading a scroll on her pillow. Suddenly, big green wall of fire. TImberwolf out of nowhere.
Timberwolves have always been ran from in this show.
twilight_sprinkle: Who are they making this show for, by the way? We are the ones they are trying to entertain when they make the show.'
otakon, q manticore, 3 timberwolves
Timberwolves are wolves made from tree's
why isnt the timberwolf coming back to life?
So they must be a pretty serious threat
awwwwwwwww
Spike didn't Teleport the corn cakes when he used his fire to cook them...
05so
snugglebutt
no KrazyNoobs, it's for children first.
and how is the lamp still up?
KrazyNoobs: they said they will continue to aim it primarily at children
They're apparently some sort of magically enchanted golem. Who knows where they come from.
otakon: Yeah, there was a picture showing your point, I dont have a link atm tho :(
05that proves we can have high quality streams
hand sha...er, pinkie pro...uh... fist bump
Eulshy: Manticore that was twice the size of one TW and a DRAGON nearly 10 times bigger
05but why have that if it costs users
I saw all them P's Wrek
All 720 of them.
Ill just stream direct from a 1080p file
being raised in ponyville would be so awsome
I had 3-4 hickups during the episode, nothing major
otakon, element of surprise
Yeah, superretroworld, except for all the frigging monsters.
In some videos I can see 1080 pixels.
Wrek: good point, I'm happy with 480p I got a bit a lag but it was fine mostly
Stallion_of_War: Maybe it's an instinctual thing that can be triggered conciously.
05its 6 in the morning...
TIME FOR A DRINK!
java and twilight_sprinkle: Well, that honestly sucks. I think children can definitely handle fight scenes, but then soccermoms will probably complain about it.
1080p is pushing it
Task Manager; Lightweight browser - kill all unnecessary processor usage -> handle HD streams
P0N3: true that
You'd think living next to a forest filled with deadly mythical creatures would deter ponies, but nope.
the stream was fime on my end, and I'm picking up internet from a house away
To bed with you Wreky
Wrek: That's what I told you. I don't know how you do it.
/me smooch Wrek.
Hi
KrazyNoobs: not even about the soccer moms, i dont watch this show for fight scenes either
Dat chat
YEAH!
a'wwww
wait
I watch this show because it is awesome.
I see soemthing
Hmmmm.... ghost Rarity

Top: Banned from Equestria
Anger is that from that questionable flash game?
Bottom: real show
Java: nah, imma play vidjah games
yes it Deacon
bye
twilight_sprinkle: I watch the show because it is awesome, but they should at least make it better. This show has great potential, in my opinion, and I love it the way it is. If they wish to continue producing it in this way, I wouldn't mind; it just has to be good.
Java: VIDYAH!
berberborscing wat?
That cello is so real that it makes Octavia look fake.
berberborscing well she is a cartoon
^
yeah the detail on the cello is awesome Wrek
Next time can we watch Gravity Falls?
one thing that would help the show is more strong male character development
No.
05enjoy awesoem music
Whatever streams streams, Java.
05also im slightly tipsy
PonyGuyRulz: Shining Armor
05best time to draw
Hah
Vinyl has disappeared from this image.
Java: Oh, watched that yesterday. Was in Danish, so slightly worse than it could've been, but good nonetheless.
LadyCanary: Well, they accept imputs.
yeah but he always gets hipnotized or something
Wrek: so what was that RArity we saw eh? A little sauce like the old days? :P
dat detail
They can consider it for latter.
wow.
Holy caucasian males, that is detail.
twilight_sprinkle: I don't care about the fights
well bye
ooh, wood texture
bye Eul...gone
seeya eul-- oh
It's so..... wood.
so
I dun wanna see saucy Rarity :'(

...
Now make it all a diamond cello.
NINETEEN DAYS!?
Tom: IT ISN'T CALLED KEEP CALM AND FLUTTER ON
Yup
OH GODS NO
otakon: I have difficulty being excited for something more than 3 days away.
19 days? holy shit

Hah.
FUCK YOU BOTS

NINETEEN DAYS!?

otakon especially if you caught the prediction, then yea
That's what it says on the tin.
Nineteen.

The cello was made of gold once
hey whatband is this?
o_e
I believe it's Alexi something or other...
Cant remember >_>
Wrek: ah thanks
any way... MID JANUARY UNTIL NEW PONY
the horror
THE HORROR!
Meh
otakon: That's not so bad
Spoiler...
Ugh, I'll just go to sleep. Maybe I'll get 4 hours before I'm kicked out.
otakon eh, not as bad as three and a half months
well more like 4-5
but eh
And not this kind of spoiler http://ducatiforum.co.uk/attachments/f17/7434d1351408926-motogp-spoiler-silver-z-1.jpg
Night, everyone. And get some sleep every once in a while, ya crazy bastards.

Night Kammerjunk|Zzz :)
yea, thinking about hitting the hay too, really should come here often, see ya!
I have an image somewhere of one of my cars
05lets listen to one of their good ones
Forza?
Someone has my taste in music.
Need For Speed World
oh
I really REALLY watn Forza 4 though
Gonna get it by next month
damn ads!
I'm good with my GT5
Can we get some Dio up?
I thought that cello had enough detail on it...
There is never enough.
Then he'll never finish this image
Anything from Master of the Moon or Stand Up and Shout would be perfect.
pon3, just mute it and play song in background then
no
just a test
:o
Aw. Was hoping op was a dio fan.:)
who dont like dio?
Good question.
I figured out how to get AdBlock for chrome. Anyone know how to get it for mozilla firefox
I love the detail he always put in his pictures'
Made with so much care
Yeah this art is pretty kick ass.
Who'
Who's doing this?
P0N3, Wrek
Wrek, I think?
Nice job Wrek! I like your art.
Whats streaming?

Him finishing up the cello
This rock has good drums.
berberborscing: I upload several of my GT5 photos on Gran Turismo photo viewer. The problem is they show the photos randomly so I can't point out which one is my car. Here's the website: http://www.gran-turismo.com/sg/gt5/photo/
It can be hard to find a really good drummer.
These are all so high quality my eyes are crying in awesomeness
I wonder how long this will take...
#Spike
Which car and what color
what band is this agian?
He does the eyes perfectly
Car model & color
berberborscing: Not shown. It was rotated every day.
oh
Mfw I try to zoom in on the pic from my computer :D
It only available for region 3 GT5 though.
#youcanhashtag?
cool
YEP
05this is oen of my fav songs with these guys
/me listens to Alone at the Landfill.
05enjoy
just because you can doesn't mean you should. do it enough and the mods will speak up
05the solos are fantastic
I really wish I was here when he did the wood design :(
guise, fullscreening the stream is amazing
Dave McGraw, also a good drummer.
Maybe Wrek can put out a short tutorial for wood later... wait.
:o
cool
That's a skin?
ALL the detail
Imported skin?
....wut .-.
:d
05hidden layers ftw
Machinery or snowfalkes?
Looks like gears.
:O
So, probably steampunk.
So that's just skin?
Ooooh.
So steampunk
I like magepunk.
I like Desertpunk
Like the Jawas?
A question: can you vinylize cars in GT5?
Vinylise?
Hee hee. Java Jawa.
Add vinyls.
Jawas on espresso. Dear god.
You mean replace the hood with carbon fiber?
no
add purple stripes
O_o
Not really. When you paint you paint the whole body.
Sounds just like NFSMW 2012!
If you want to "pimp" the car you better go with Forza then
I lived playing Import Tuner when I was little ^^
NFSU and NFSU2
berberborscing: Is it any good?
One of best games in NFS history.
05love this solo
Damn it.... now I feel like I have to draw...
I rarely play NFS games. I was playing Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero.
Underground 1 had the Honda S2000 and the Integra I think
Can we import images from outside sources?
08,01and then my computer exploded
I liked the old hot pursuit :<
So far this is looking like a pretty great picture.
08,01i love Damascus in AssCreed
08,01it's so cool
Yeha
Does anyone else have constantly pot-smoking neighbours?
That stuff stinks so bad.
08,01i wish i could go there for realsies and be some kind of rich merchant
my dad smoks pot
08,01P0N3: my neighbours do
Three SUVs in NFSU2, them being Hummer H2, Lincoln Navigator, and Cadillac Escalade
Isn't it a pain?
I live in VIctoria BC so I have my window open like all the time.
08,01P0N3: i don't know, i've never asked them
wrek is so smoth XD
Sometimes I come home, and my home is just full of pot reek.
You best be packing some serious time-machineage and psychic paperage then
http://www.fdwallpapers.com/games/images/nfs_underground2.jpg
berberborscing: Is Hummer fast enough?
08,01P0N3: suggestion: get some pot yourself, then you won't care.
SUVs have their own races with SUVs only
:p
08,01and the whole situation will seem kinda funny
Image borked
Lol. There's an idea. But no, I'm a grownup... I don't smoke pot any more.
08,01how old are you?
Once I was in 6th grade, the asshole of life itself...
I just drink like all the other old ladies.:P
And I sat next to this kid named Brandon
berberborscing: The best mixed race is in Motostorm. It's just fun.
?
Honestly? I'd say none of your business, but I'll tell tonight. I'm in my early thirties.
He failed intensive math
He smoked pot
He hated the bus driver with a burning passion
He raped me once
He threatened to kill m
PON3: Are we all old here?
and so... yeah
berberborscing: Wait WHAT?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Celestia Radio's Top 100 Music Countdown
What??
he what?
I like this version of this song
He was kicked off the bus next year. The driver couldn't take him.
08,01ah, in that case, you're in that age range between when it's okay to smoke pot because you're young and stupid, and when it's okay to smoke pot because you're old and wise
08,01or in pain
yay wrek time
Well I sure feel old sometimes.
Things move so fast now, with technology and culture.
Brandon was some serious emo shit.
Y'all and youre drugs....bleh.
08,01are you past Logan's Run age?
Now 30 is considered old :(
i leave for 5 seconds...i come back to "he raped me once"....nice
bleh
08,01if not, you have nothing to be worried about
I can't wait to be old. THen you get all the good drugs legally.
I'm 17 and feel old :I
He talked very deeply into the bus driver, like saying "I hope you get back to molesting your mother and die in the fiery burning pit of hell"
He listened to Slipknot and his favorite movie was Saw II
08,01berberborscing: enhance your calm. no more talking of such stuff in here. this is a nice place, for nice people.
Go to Mr. pharmacist man. He's like, "Here, have these drugs. Go enjoy the rest of your life."
I will now!
does anyone know the band name?
That was the worst year of my life indeed. ^^
Berberborscing, he sounds like a typical burnout type.
Sorry he raped you, that's not cool.
Like the kid that tried to bomb the school, Jared Cano?
PON3: When you receive all those medicines, you feel like death is standing behind you. Waiting.
Jared hated my school so much he layed out an elaborated bombing
in the cafe
/me yawns.
He was caught by an officer
Well Java I imagine you do until they kick in.
Depends on my own funds
I'm surprised we don't see more geriatric streaking.
When I have my old-age meds, I might.
He is now sentenced to 15 years of prison, starting Dec. 5th
08,01P0N3: you and me both
Does anyone know what editor he's using?
O_o
I have to take anti-psychosis pills :<
08,01i'm going to compensate for being old by also being adorably insane
PON3: I don't want to see a geriatric running around naked while yelling YOLO or something.
Yeah fortunately most of those kinds of kids are stupid and get caught, Berberborscing.
My great grandmother is awesomely insane.
berberborscing: At least he's in prison serving time.
I think it's time for me to head to sleep.
08,01speaking of being old, my dad is 65, and he's way more of a gamer than i am. i caught him helling "take that, noob" on CoD the other day
Justice is served.
I'll be like one of the golden-girls, except less well adjusted and listening to dubstep.:D
My mom said "Can't wait until college. That's the best years of your life!"
08,01*yelling
Thank you for streaming Wrek <3 wub. And happy new year to all!
berberborscing: It is!
08,01i was so proud
97 years old and she beat the crap out of the person who tried to help her up after she fell over... then offered him candy like nothing happened not 2 minutes later :D
hah, my dad is like 58, and he doesn't know how a computer works
08,01i jsut hope he never find 4chan
My high school suck. My college tears are fun
years
08,01Jim: my dad helped invent the floppy drive
:o
the dirve or the floppy? ;)
Raver, muggers sometimes underestimate old folks with hilarious results.
Which eventually evolved into the CD
08,01P0N3: it would be out of character for him, but i'd be so proud
These are guys who went to war. THey know how to fight fast and hard.
08,01but yeah, i don't think it's his thing
My brother felt bad for me paying for all his food at the mall the other day, so he made me cookies and milk ^^
And a lot of the old ladies can fight too.
He went to Blondie's cookies and the Candy barrel so... yeah
old ladies mud wrestling?
P0N3: Lol, it wasnt a mugger though, it was a paramedic :D
08,01i didn't tell him that it was pretty much mostly gay sex.
Wow. That would sure be a thing to see, Java.
You would never unsee that.
Thats what makes it so great.
lel
08,01Java: i've seen that
08,01it was hilarious
haahahahahaha
08,01daftest bunch of old ladies i've ever met
You know what are horrible?
Pony Thread Simulators
Wasn't the Greek army mostly made of gay couples?
They would fight together naked or something.
O_o
08,01pretty much, yeah
I mean like in ancient ancient days.

08,01ah, i could do with something naked, greek, and very, very male right now
08,01muscly.
lol
08,01*muscley.
Greek guys sure don't look like those statues. The statues always look like Mr. Universe, but when I see a Greek guy he's always this big burly hairy guy.
u spelled it rite before
What happened there.
08,01oh, okay
08,01P0N3: yeah, not that kind
08,01but i've seen plenty of hot greeks
I remember an "ask me I answer" session with a bored Greek soldier on the Greece and Turkey border. He said Turkey soldiers love to troll Greek soldiers by deliberately crossing the border.
08,01mostly in my mind.
When I saw a pony thread simulator, I heard the disgusting things people said
05thats the hoof
05now imgagine all of her liek that
I admittedly haven't seen many Greeks, that I know of.
08,01speeking of hot greeks
08,01evein' wrek
Lol I love pony thread simulators. :D
08,01what the hell is a Hufflepuff?
they're so hilarious and disturbing at the same time
Harry Potter?
08,01er, i mean, Pony Thread Simulator (PTS)?
I wont bother with a link during stream
Anyway, people talk about topics
Mostly, and almost always about cumming everywhere on horses
Woah! Woah
Oh the internet
Oi berberborscing, move on.
and they say dumb shit that is also hilarious
^
Yeah, there's stuff like ">You find yourself in Equestria. >Rainbow Dash's funeral. >Too late, you've already crashed it. >Wat do" Every time at least one person says "Rape."
No matter what the scenario.
sad 'cuz its true
Moving onnnnnnn
I cant
Ill be kicked
Phase4 Shizuka actually was planning on cleaning that
13:P
How about..... uh....games?
Games are fun
but can't join
13that's what we've been doing
05oh and yay im considered hot
I want Forza 4...
05:o
I feel like I just missed something important
it is
08,01of course you're considered hot
Nothing too important.
and i am
Hmm?
I'm not hot, I'm 'cute'. I HATE being cute.
I want a pet parakeet.
It's like being hot but without getting any respect.
08,01you're like this hot, cute little Thor
08,01with glasses
O_o
what did I come back to
RaveBrony: doing the beast mode atm
Im a straight male, so my opinion is biased :D
youre lucky u missed sumthing
08,01GabeMoist: i actually do have some somewhere
i'm looking for the the older versions Shizu seems like i need to downgrade like 5 mods to join
08,01but he has clothes on in almost all of them.
O_o
13sec i'll get you the mediafire link to my multimc instance
>almost
I'm listening to these people outside who are smoking the pot. I'm not sure what nationality they are. Either Punjabi or Egyptian.
I can't tell.
multimc ?
Either you're hot or you're not
08,01P0N3: quite a broad sweep there
Raver, it's okay for a guy to think another guy is attractive.
That doesn't mean he wants to do him.
13better launcher, maintains instances of minecraft with different mods or versions
It just means he recognizes another guy is hot.
Are you sure PON3? there are tons of langfuage in Asia.
kk
Ill say a guy looks good, I wont say hes hot :D
I dunno it sounds pretty middle eastern.
when im bored i feel like doing this. " "
Actually I think they're Armenian. Or Israeli.
PON3: There are almost 100 active languages in my country alone (and 1 national language) so I don't judge so easily
Chewing cookie to the rhythm of this song
Wow what country?
Indonesia
Oh cool. How are things there?
Indianapolis
It's cool how there's bronies all over the globe.
Nope, im in florida.
Good mostly, but the petroleum price are problematic
08,01P0N3: i think by now all we can be fairly certain of, going by your description, is that they're from somewhere in one of the "brown regions" of planet earth.
woo another floridian
I stand by Israeli. Pretty sure.
I don't understand the language, but pretty sure about the accent.
I was a Floridian for 17 years, sooo, I stil consider myself one :3
Hmm, time to go to bed, it's almost 7 am
08,01i really want to go and visit Damascus
And honestly, most of the regions of the world have brown people. Caucasians are a minority.
G'night folks!
Bro hoof if you're floridian! /)
08,01but... i don't want to be killed
05bronies can appreciate this song
Been in NY for 1 yeah and a half now tho
05shoot her to the moon
Night Jim :)
hehe ive been in florida my whole live, so ya hehe
So, what's the crime like in Indonesia?
Cya Jim! Good seeing ya!
life*
Crime in the US is worse usually.
Canada can actually be pretty bad. Especially Toronto, Vancouver.
This is why I don't live on the mainland.
Let's all move to Greenland!
It'll be nation of the bronies
Yay! Let's move to Greenland and freeze our asses off!
PON3: Well, I heard there's a Maple Syrup Cartel out there. And the smuggling of 20 million dollars worth of Maple Syrup....
08,01Java: i suppose it helps that i am actually brown
08,01or at least, i'm brown until i open my mouth
Lol
05brown mute
08,01then i'm very white, but with the wrong colour skin
05with sunglasses
Java, you'd be surprised how much drug traffic comes through Canada.
Thru Russia?
From all over the world, I guess.
Russia made my favorite sports car :(
I see
And it trickles into the US through our leaky border.
O_o what?
Maybe TSA is getting problematic.
Hey, TSA actually helpful for once?
Plus all this Canadian pot.
08,01considering the British Embassy have withdrawn from Syria...
It's our largest crop next to wheat.
08,01i don't think it would be a good idea for me to go there
Phase4 is best pony
08,01GabeMoist: i'll be the first Scottish Embassy in Syria!
You don't want to go to GreenLand? Well, is it gonna be Antarctica or Easter Island?
o_o
08,01Java: love.
Kilts?
Awwwww
People in the US, your DHS is really scaring me. What's with them buying tanks and all that hollowpoint ammunition?
That is just FREAKY.
M yonly weapon is a bow.
08,01what's hollowpoint used for?
I want a kilt....
percing skin
THey're bullets that blow up!
08,01get a kilt, then
P0N3 - stockpiling before everything gets so heavily regulated because of the recent stuff that's been happening, i'm sure
And blow chunks out of things!
/me 08,01hugs Java back
I want to try kilt, but I afraid getting boner when I wear one
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096
Hahaha
P0N3: naw, thats Incenerary
If you got it, flaunt it! :D
08,01bitch, i just know you didn't post a non-image link during a stream.
Hollowpoint bullets shatter.
05check stream
It's not a video
And mushroom out, causing a ton of damage.
08,01gimme a sec, wrek
Hollowpoint hurt more.
:(
hollow point rounds fragment on hit causing considerably more organ damage than normal slugs
P0N3: ah, now i see
I hate hollowpoint.
08,01okay...
too cruel
I always thought it was to peirce skin all the time :P
08,01that's quite nasty
08,01so basically, hollowpoint is the "you're fucked now, laddie" round.
basically
Yup
World War 4 we will fight with stick and stones. That's what Einstein said.
05its very effective agaistn unarmored targest
05ts*
Unless you're wearing kevlar.
08,01berberborscing: i don't hate you, i just hate that you're disregarding our rules
hello guys
And how come in the USA there's always someone going nuts and shooting someplace up?
08,01pony64: and girls?
But chances are you'll be wearing normal clothes, so yes you're screwed.
what about the bullets that pierce through tanks like tissue paper?
berberborscing - those are exact opposite. they're a solid chunk of metal
05anotehr example
they'll make a nice clean hole
berberborscing: There's no such thing as bullet that can pierce metal that easily.
052nd is hollowpoint
while ur here, you guys should tune into celestia Radio, they are doin a new years day top pony song countdown, just wanted to spread the news
Watch the video called "SCP 096"
Not videogame, real life
Java, there are some .50 bullets that can make a pretty neat hole in armour plate.
I don't remember what they're made from though.
Hello everyone
hello
P0N3 - in all fairness, that's a 50-cal
I know, but direct hit. Not angled hit.
Yeah.
Some sort of ceramic composite I think.
The title is just SCP 096. Nothing else
Or a 3Dp alloy.
http://images.wikia.com/battlefordreamislandfanfiction/images/f/f3/Book.png
Most tanks nowadays are angled to deflect bullets.
armours
well taht's a given
the armor is designed that way to deflect and absorb, common design really
Hee hee remember those gimmickey corner-shots?
A bullet, but not from any gun. From a gun so large it's considered a building
anyway where is RX when you need him?
Revolver Ocelot?
Yes cause this is clearly the chat to ask otakon.
Jmo: quiet Marsupial
like half of the children here know who RX is otakon
05who?
only rx i know is Mazda RX7 AND 8
berberborscing: A gun so large, it's become inefficient to use or move around.
Oh, why hello there everybody.
hello tackeart
Wrek: Sweetibot, aka Savage Grimlock, aka RX-78 Sweetiebot
the gunsmith
It launches ICBMs, and SCP 096 was a fucked up human not showing pain from any gun bullets
096?
So what's going on in the stream right now?
/me goes to SCP
This ICBM hit him and was split in hjalf at the torso
05168
tackeart: intermission
But he still was ripping apart his squad.
seems like that.
I thought they already remove those mary sue SCP like that.
oh god THAT THING
think Slenderman but nastier and naked
Dafuw is that thing?
So are there any streams planning, or is the intermission going to be here for a while?
Slenderman is naked.
those aren't his suits.
INTERMISSIONNNNNNNNNN
What's the bad-guy equivalent of a Mary Sue?
bloo and cream son
Is there one?
Mary poo?
They say SCP 096 is agitated and goes into severe emotional distress when someone looks at his face directly, video recording, or even photograph
The guy who beats all the other characters up so the Mary Sue can show how tough thei are by beating up the bad guy.
05meh
Then he chases them until they die
05the thign from ao oni is worse
evil mary sue is the jocker from batman
wow, i have uploaded, 100 pictures, on the BFDI fanfiction wiki (:
05also
Do we have Pony fanfic but with sudden bad ending in the end?
What's the music, anyway?
His speed is at least 35 km/h to (not permitted to show)
dat piC@!!!!
ew
It varies on his distance
QW9ER0YFHA8OEuidfrwyg
uhhhhhhh
what the fuck did i just see
i dont want to see that again
the end.
What did you see?
What did you guys see? I was distracted by something adorable.
^
a pinkie pie
05they saw scp 168 but as pinkie pie
lol
The joy of taking things apart to fic them is gone
I mustve lagged
what the heck is scp 168?
I dont know :(
oh hey, the stream is starting again.
05google is your friend
Listen to @Wrek.
Google sucks balls
Okay Op! Let's see if you can find a picture of... Pinkie Pie in a bikini.
I did just google it, it showed me guns :I
we cant rate youtube 1-5 because of google
RaveBrony: check youtube
More pony??
DRAGON QUEST
What is this madness????
moar pony!
I think Like Dislike already exist before google acquisition
AD NOOOO
MY Fav EP!! <3
dat Shy
I like this episode because Rainbow Dash gets stomped.:)
:(
o sh**
Fatality!
hahahaha
I liek this episode because it proves how stupid the MLP wiki is, They said Fluttershy was a BP in this episode :D
I still get nothing for 168.... :(
SCP-168
there
Most popular is 173
Yeah, nothing :\
the stair?
He has a videogame on him
them numbers, what do they mean mason!!?
FRAAAANCE
05my bad
Oh, I love this scene
05173*
WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASON
I hate how Fluttershy is back to acting like a little bitch.
graaaahhhhh
Oooooh, ty Wrek
pony64: SHALL WE ELECTROCUTE YOU AGAIN MASON
That scene with the book was just sad.
When she found the info on the alicorn amulet.
And EVERYONE just ignored her.
Ill find image of SCP 173.
SCP 682
that thing is scary as hell
http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110512190444/villains/images/5/5a/173.jpg
._.
Camoflage is SUPPOSED to be drab, Rarity. That's the point, to not be seen in an environment.
SCP-087 made me cry
The scariest one is SCP 106.
P0N3: she does have to speak up, but it's in her personality, being quiet
daaattt piccccc
Rainbow with a camo hat. Heh.
05there there
05no more scp
I know, but I still found it disappointing. Fluttershy needs to really finally be more assertive.
the worst hadaka apron ever
barf
Dafuq is this SCP?
Or she'll go nuts again.
I agree with Wrek, let's just discuss the episode.
Ive seen it, but i dont know what it is
God Spike is so whipped.
SCP is mythology used to make people paranoid
He's so whipped he has no idea.
Fake stories that are written really fucking well
berberborscing: Or is it?
Dat OOooOOooOO <3
Rarity: The fasion Freak, AppleJack: The Apple Addiction, Twilight: The Purple Book worm, Fluttershy: The Quiet Beast, Pinkie Pie: The Hyper Pink Cupcake, Rainbow Dash: The Rainbow Rush
^fan notifications
lol waddle
Ponies like, permanently ruined Spike.
flutterchu: Uh..are you listing wrestler names?
He'll never be a real dragon.
tackeart: nope
o mah gosh, u r soo raght
Identity crisis
nope.nope
I regretted image searching 106.
Still better than DC timeline.
^
Twilight's always solution: "We'll do books."
double ^
make it double
triple ^
Idiot writers ruin DC comics.
Why yes they do, spike.
HEY GUYS :3
herlo
Yet Twilight suddenly knows about the dragon code
oL:
J_E_Smith71: Ikr?
J_E_Smith71: I think Spike made his own "codes
or maby she has talked to spike offscreen maby or soemthing
lol PON3
P0N3: Sounds like her.
i love this ep
Derpy: The Ditzy Dimwit :P
And she's so snarky too.
Sandvich
Spike made his code after this I think
Java: And also Marvel for certain Spider-Man events
Twilight is adorkable and I like her but I would never ever be able to live iwth her.
spike.. wut he doing?
Spike, stop being so derp. Dragons DO end up burning their home village down.
she said not today
P0N3: ^^^^ to infinity.
Spiderman is ruined.
I realized, Twilight's kinda keeping Spike from growing up XD
Dat shto at RD
I'd rather steal Trixie's cart, kick her out, etc.
:D
"its my money and i need it now"
*shot
raritys so funny
Now that star wars is owned by disney... let's hope to god for no musicals
lolololol
05i should design a scary game
No wrek!
yes
I couldn't live with Pinkie Pie... I couldn't live with Twilight... I couldn't live with Rarity. Oh god never ever Rarity.
I play SCP, im paranoid enough!
Wrek: That will be fun..
Wrek: the simpler the scarier
Let's see. That leaves Applejack and Fluttershy.
05im swedish so its in my blod to be unconditionally sadist
ohai ad
With Fluttershy I would always just feel guilty somehow, like I'm always intruding.
P0N3 - but on the bright, side, you'd never have to go clothes shopping again with rarity
u suk.
"were following him right?" "HELL YEAH"
So I guess if I had my choice, Applejack.
05blood*
P0N3 what's the matter? You're not civilized?
AJ is best poni
Yes, that includes Republic Commando, Grim Fandango, etc.
beard
but maby not best pony
Well that's true MirrorImage but Rarity is also very very OC.
lol
fail
ponies?
OC?
OC WTF
Obsessive compulsive.
Orange Carrots
*OCD.
aj is most important pony. where the hell am i gonna get apples from without her
dammit
I'm civilized, but Applejack just seems... well. Comfortable.
pish posh
Twilight is way more OCD
lol
Rarity is just clean
twilight is ocd pony
I couldnt live with anypony, because theyre cartoon characters :I
Imagine if Twilight and Rarity had to share living arrangements for a long period of time.
lol
P0N3: Fanfiction ensues!
theyd porb do fine
Probably already has! :)
Slenderman IS less scary then SCP now that I think about it
SCP?
the backround has the same dragon from dragonshy
Slenderman is nothing
Slenderman is an egg wearing a suit that gets scared off by saltwater.
have you guys played that staircase SCP?
So..
Slenderman is one guy chasing you consistently
How is the test?
P0N3: Secure Contain Protect
in SCP, you have 5 different guys to worry about
just run to the ocean and he won't chase you.
Wow never heard of that.
lololol
SCP?
SCARY
173 teleports.
SCP YEAH
either that, or trap him and dump him into the ocean.
there's tons of SCP
AHAAHAHA
106 can walk through walls.
THis ep is great
who 146
went well.
117 can kill grunts
this is one of my least favorite episodes
there are 10 scps in game but half of them are harmless machines
Crackle's cousin is best pony
Hmm, Peewee
>Spike falls in with a group of dragon teenagers >Thinks they're representative of dragons as a whole.
Awesome Blue flame
All of them can be killed by the dev console.
P0N3: Spike is idiotic like that.
420-J cannot
He;s the guy that looks like weed on the floor
Well thats it for me. Night Everypony :)
It is scary because for most of the time, you are going further and further down, and you get used to it, and suddenly, !!!
I have favorites, but i can watch ANY episode, exept The Season 2 premere
gnight dude
KrazyNoobs: *MGS alarm sound*
twilight...
flutterchu: thank you
g'night, venom
That was Princess Celestia inviting Twilight to her birthday.
She doesn't go.
Notice how you don't blink in Slender.
Cya MissVenom
winner
P0N3: Celestia seems to be forever alone.
wat
Lol.:)
berberborscing: blinking wasnt relevant in slender
ew
Crackleeeee
Naah I'm sure Princess Celestia is where most of the stallions went.
SCP invented blinking just so 173 could rape you faster
cracle, cute
She hoards them.
Crackle is best dragon
..
cool
Good night guys :)
I mean, all her loved ones are dying one by one, and Celestia is slowly starting to make bad decisions more and more.
night sonicdude558
Cya sonicdude558
Nite nite Sonic.
Owwww
Nite, sonicdude.
my favorite episode is Season 2, episode 23, because it's the fist episode ive ever watched, but not the first Pony video ive ever seen
night sonic
The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Princess Celestia.
I got trolled 2 times in a pony TF2 server
dat tail
Oh boy. That letter is probably relavent to the wedding between Shining Armor and Princess Cadence.
celestia has the whole royal guard to play with
and the elements
P0N3: She [i]is[/i] pretty much going insane from all these deaths.
Daring, I bet they're all gelded.
aw, no italics.
meh, I am going to stay up past by bread time
SCP 173 is in GMod, but no matter how far away he is he teleports right in fucking front of you!
*halo jokes*
right now is about soup time not quite bread time
I dunno Tackeart, I think after a few thousand years you'd probably adjust.
Fail
fail
I think she's just making worse and worse decisions by now.
My dream has been to be in one of those bronystate new episode explosion videos
why does it keep skipping?
I am ganna lrer
ya, lava splash, not dangerous at all
I'd make a remark about Spyro the Dragon dying from lava, but..
She's going through that awkward "just wants to be one of the girls' phase. Again. Probably happens every couple hundred years.
Do you think the owner of MLP would like u streaming MLP?
yep
P0N3: Yeah, but still making dumber and dumber decisions by now.
Bellyflop = burned even if water is cold
i wonder what it would be like to swim in lava without burning or melting to death
Bellyflop into lava = holy motherfucking shit
be pretty hard to swim in lava
dont think they care.
atnon: Pleasantly warm.
oh
considering it's thick as frozen syrup
tails up
I think it's great how Equestria is so peaceful. But I don't think they're prepared at all for any kind of catastrophic invasion.
^
Are ponies really so tough that they have no fear out invasion?
Oppa Dragon Style?
Let's see...
Dragons should be as powerful as shit to support Lava
Sombra...
Luna...
Discord...
Chrysails
....
So yes?
Wha?
Sure, but can you imagine how awesome a pony fps would be?
this is a land where ponies exterminated humans
FOREVER?!
They're also prey of an African Rock Python
Fun Fact: Chrysails is the only villan to sing on MLP FIM
don't underestimate them
thats like, 4-evers
Pegasi bombing stuff, unicorns using arcane magic to collapse entire mountainsides, earthpony army with heavy munitions.
Sombra was the one who got closest to actually KILLING the Mane Six.
P0N3: But how do they hold guns without magic?
i guess you're gonna miss the panty raid...
Mag- oh, no wait...
discord coulda prob killed them if he wanted 2
I dunno, I'm sure you could come up with ways.
Yeah, we haven't really seen the military defenses of Equestria much... aside from some stoic guards led by a Unicorn who's really good at force fields.
SLIDE! SLIIDE!
Ponies don't have fingers, so no guns if they can't even pull the trigger
its acuactually all there fault for making fun of him for not being like other dragons
Pony mounted miniguns with mouth controls?
makes sence
> Have to hoof it
Use your 'magination! :D
berberborscing - prehensile tongue
>Shes stanfing on RD back
maby Celestia has like 5x as many gaurds but they are under invisibility spells?
*standing

one single alicorn could defend a whole city against a swarm of thousands.
invisible anti-griffon missles
I love birds.
Phoenixes <3
DaringDerpy: Basically.
Phoenixes are really good at teleportation, apparently.
Man, a pony - griffon war could be some awesome stuff.
My friend through a rock at a spider in my face, and I felt bad.
And pony-dragon.
Then the spider fell onto his face. :)
we've never seen multi alicorn spells so far
TEH EGG :P
THat makes me want to play WoW again.... and fly around on 'Ashes of Al'ar' :(
:O
Kinda hard when they can go on fire
ohai everypony
I like how the phoenixes here just lay down the shit on those dragons.
never piss off a phoenix
hello
Whoops, excuse my language. Sorry.
hi SexyIshy
hi pony64
OBJECTION
well they are kid dragons
05wonder hwo many forest fires phoenixes have caused
failed
Phoenix: the capital of arizona
So even IF the dragons ate them, they'd just immolate the dragons from inside.
Ten Shin Han move
i was already here daring ><
Moltres used Sunny Day
for like an hour
We haven't seen ANYTHING of Pee Wee since this episode!
@Wrek: None, because they psychically control the fire.
best rarity moment coming up
I was so looking forward to more phoenix chick in the show.
did anyone noticed that one of the dragons have hair?
Aw, i skipped
but hello anyhow
Wrek and thats how Phoenix Arizona got it's name and became a desert
Hah
so the world is gunna be overpopulated by pheonixes
flutterchu: Reptiles can have hair too
Phoenixes can be killed in their egg form I beleive, or their youth when they're not supposed to shed
Java: name one
Epic Rarity moment! <3
lol
They should have just kept the costume on...
RUN SPIKE RUN
or not
oh dam!
:D
If nothing stops this, this will lead to explosive population growth of the Phoenixes. These dragons might actually be doing the right thing, as tasteless as it may be.
Little fluffy ponies are just not intimidating.
these teen dragons are quite stupid.
Oh, rarity <3
flutterchu: Mostly short hairs though
namy-pamby
XD
Gotta love rarity
Spike should turn into an Alicorn in season 3
nope
Tacos!
Lolwut
angry rarity is so cute
Spike. Pff nah.
RUN XD
Kandarihu: For all we know, they all fly off to some kind of phoenix city.
Run Away Little Girl!!! Run away.....
A world conquered by Phoenixes? This is gonna be Legend of the Guardians all over again...
One of the Cake babies should turn into an alicorn.
flutterchu: Also I forget the name of the reptile who have hair...
Twilight do- oh
But still have petty little baby desires.
yeah yo got it
lol
flutterchu: Call him Mystery Douche, that should work.
Then they stuck on that tree and dies
<3 <3
im gonna play MLP on iPad again
Alicorn princess Pumpkin Cake.

Pony64: All those green eyes you see in the forest? Yeah, those are all changelings.

So I have an important question for you guys.
WHERE IS MY GOD DAMN one BUTTON
If they were real...
Who would get a fluffy pony and give it lots of love and sketties?
sketties?
i best go for the night
Yeah spaghetti.
Apparently fluffy ponies looove spaghetti.
bye guys
whenever i read spaghetti i think of mario saying it
That would come in handy for me because of all the pocket pasta I drop when I buy ponies at the toy store.
cya duude
pocket pasta...
Nini Slender.
dont know if you guys'll like it but i think this is kinda catchy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZo1p3YfR-g&list=UUI51O-JgWkh8QRjJQ9ozzrQ
08,01http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15oyce/in_50_years_time_what_do_you_think_will_be_the/c7oh90r
For the record I would totally have a fluffy pony.
And give it lots of nummies and hugs.
^
Just give it a lifejacket.
Night folks
I don't even get the question
night man
nite, j
-yawns-
pony64: Sounds good, like the old mix
:)
pony64: That is an awesome mix.
i know, surpised its so not-wellknown
>Fluffy pony is playing in the living room. >Time to water your plants. You water the plants, fluffy pony chases her ball. >You pull out the spray bottle, and begin misting the house plants. >Fluffy pony drowns.
EQD? but its not even mai video
P0N3: And THAT is why you give them scuba gear and supply it using whatever is inside their fur.
o ok
Scuba gear is expensive. Fluffy ponies are like ten bucks each.
So give them a gas mask or something.
or a helmet.
Hee hee, well, I doubt they'd drown very easily, but I have to agree with the helmet.
Might be a good idea.
There's actually a dog named Bizkit who wears a helmet.
He gets up when he's sleeping and runs into walls.
I wonder how feasible just giving them better lungs would be.
His helmet has "Sleepwalking Bizkit" painted on it.
modern science can provide what you need, we'll find the answer
pony64 i did but the ass hat woulden post it
ALTERNATELY... What nature has neglected, the fruits of modern﻿ science shall provide..
In my headcanon, fluffies are the earliest ancestor of proper Equestrian ponies.
well he cant just post everything
but it was a song
what video did you put in?
o, song bleh
After the weak and stupid fluffies are thinned out of feral herds and they figure out puffing their cheeks up doesn't scare predators, they start to actually survive.
And slowly evolve.
P0N3: Tell the puffing cheeks part to guinea pigs, considering they still do that.
time to play metroid prime for the interwebz people
Hee hee do they really?
That's cute.
-runs around in circles-
seriously, they puff their fur up and everything, like cats.
I'll have to look on Youtube.
sadly they don't hiss.
what in the hey-name are you guys talking aboot?
fluffy ponies and how we should experiment on them to stop them from drowning so much.
drowning?
why would they drown
You haven't been around much, have you?
apparently not
couldnt u just put them on the moon where they can't drown or something
..Wat.
my reasoning: tf2
brain is inert
how to care for derpy plush: sleep with her by your side at night

I could drive to another galaxy in a hummer h1 and dropping by for gas every 10 miles and then come back and drag a planet to Earth and go back to that planet and bring back a rock sample and florida wont be done counting votes.

what are the movies of th new year
I havent checkd/seen em
also when is the new-year airing starting, anypony know??
Applejack = Mami Tomoe
stupid flash crash :|
Applejack = Commander Shephard's favorite pony in all of equestria
I could drive to another Samsung Galaxy Tab in a Tweety bird and dropping by for ponies every 10 seconds and then come back and drag Pop Star to Earth and go back to that planet and bring an enemy and I don't know what I'm writing and reading at the same time.
ohia SuperBrony64
im not superbrony64??
did he mute me or somehting
I don't think mutes are available for single users
I just want to know what movies were picked because quality of movies have gone down recently
Wait, what mute are we talking about?
>Wall-E
why everyone keep saying hi to this guy but i dont see him saying anything..??? is my internet poopig?
>down quality
not this past week's
SuperBrony64 y u quiet now
I mean the ones coming up
o ok nvm
mai bad
Of all the Pixar movies, why Wall-E
wall-e was one of my favorites
Wall-E is still a good Pixar movie
but still old
just behind Up and monsters inc
i want to sea Brave, not sure if pixar but want to see it
I mean... where is Pirates of Caribbean On stranger tides
SeaponiesofLiverpool, we've watched 12 angry men before
etc.
also anyone seen The Hobbit it twas amazinnnggg
yes
bilbo is coolest character
did you just say....
http://atom.smasher.org/error/
oh... wait.. you didn't
im fine now
Hi everypony! ^_^
Special Pokemon announcement on the 8th of Januray
heylo
IIRC
I would like to discuss about The Hobbit but I fear I won't gain anything from it at the current moment
hai newlifer
what movies for Jan. 4 /5
also I'm not one that enjoy giving out spoilers
ok yea lets not then
Topgun
aaaaand
Weird Science
Probably the Ruby and Sapphire remakes
I think
yeah
as for ponies.....
Ponymon
can't remember
lol
1. Weird Science is an A movie.... and 2. We watched Top Gun... it was called Wonderbolt academy
herg
Weird Science > Top Gun
unless its the pony version with Spitfire and Soarin
that's nice SeaponiesofLiverpool
care to keep your opinions for yourself?
but as I said, quality of movies have plummetted here
holy shit there's fleas all over me... damn cats
SuperBrony64:
is not here?
i need some PINGAS and sleeps
ill cya guys later imma go watch some anime or something
Maybe we should make a pool of movies, chosen before hoof. and then the newsletter ponies pick which A and B they want most
like what's done with the episodes kinda
^im liking this idea
for serious
Doesn't seem right.
Some movies just need to shine.
that way newer movies can be added to pool
I AM RELEVANT
maby only on not important days
Also, hai
Yeah and we
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/25252270.jpg
hello
we'll get the same movies over and over again
Ooh. Fiery.
there's tons of movies out there
when was the last time a movie from 2011 was shown?
hrm maby just have rules that say: do not use same movie 2 weeks in a row??
we can't put every single movies in a single pool
/me hugs CrystalPhoenix
if admins could agree to something liek that
How there
Admins are lurking. Right now.
pony64, we have that
no idea just putting it out there
I mean like voting on a pool from the chat or something...
>.> just sayin
Say "YYAAAAEEEHHH" if you are spying on us.
it's called do not use the movie that was shown in the span of 6 months
YEAEAAAH, wait not enouf h's
like hey guys... FLIGHT OF DRAGONS is a cool movie! we should add it to the pool
thats cool
berberborscing: but that would defeat the point of lurking.
the system is fine
winners should not be able to win again in 6 months
Pinkies4thWall: We should watch Unico's Adventures on the stream
ok only been here for like 2 weeks so i wouldnt really know
I'm pretty sure a lot of us have different choices
or at least 2 or 3
/me hugs SuperBrony64 with a pillow
though I do admit I sense a bit of rigging behind
you guys arnt refering to me are you?
pony64:JRP stop hitting him with a pillow
but still the system is fine without that factor
but
i was just huging
you guys, i aint superbrony
I sense some results are rigged a little bit in people's favor
:<
Use this trout instead!
and that's stopping newer movies from getting shown
nonsense
we had How to Train your dragon not too long ago
I once suggested Pirate OST and they said it was too new.... and it was released on DVD in 2011
I crushed a flea in my hand, then i opened my hand. That bastard wasn't even there anymore.
still new
is it illigal to air newish movies here?
HTTYD is 2010
2 years old
yeah
and
cause this is non-profit so it shouldnt be right?
newish movies = not out on DVD yet
o ok
To be honest
if its out on DVD it should be okay to be shown
they never specified their new movie rule
oki
play the Hobbit :P
just kidding
okay... the Hobbit
1970s animated version
werdup sprinkle
*wink*
poopi
plays shakespear and such on april first
ubt seriously your only concern is that newer movies aren't shown
I have to go back to school on January 3. :I
me too T~T
or you don't agree in their definition of new movies
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Thehobbit1977cover.png
NO!(ytp NO)
why thinking of a whole new system if it'll have the same problem
I'm lost, but I don't care
ok...finally back :|
I think just extending how long a winner can't double win would help
Anyone who has Windows 8 already?
I'm happy that's not what my brothers do when I'm sick.
SeaponiesofLiverpool, no it won't
because the same people seem to keep winning
When I'm sick, they still have their fat asses on their Pc.
now you change your complaint
anyone who has windows 8 has a poor internet fate
stick to one problem if you want to solve it
ryhme time on accident try
>Windows 8
>Poor Internet Fate
berberborscing: which is worse?:P
well I suggested Pirates OST, and I THINK they fixed it, but not sure
Have you even tried Windows 8 yet?
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
Little kids being surgeons. Definitely.
fix what exactly?
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall back :3
ive herd rumors that its bad which means it MUST be absolutely horrid!
Friendship is the tits.
well the movie was in no way a new movie
they still decide in the end if the movie is ok to be streamed or not
>implying the rumors are true
you're not in power to decide that
but the lottery list considered it (wrongly) a new movie
they stream what they feel is safe
Spell-of-Gaming: me thinks hes being sarcastic
A message to Windows: Stop fucking updating your software, I keep having to buy new OS that look the same
it had been released on DVD for over a year
not a new movie
guess what, it's not automatic THEY decide from THEIR head whether it's new or not
message to Apple:.... fuc i got nothin
complain to the mods
you guys are asswholes whut else?
not the system
(meant to apple/mac)
Because Metro UI is TOTALLY the same as the Start Menu.
Sometimes the chat just needs to be ded.
Windows 8: Hey, you get to look at low quality videos in 1080 pixels now, but it's still blurry as fuck because this guy's camera sucks.
metroid prime
Metroid UI
metriod dime
lets see how many words we can find that ryhmes with dime, anyone wanna play
metroid prime was a fantastic game
metriod prime
XD
Samus the Rapper
anything else you want to say about the system?
Samus for gameboy: Is that a naked woman or a lot of peach colored pixels
nope, chuck testa
is a pony with a shirt considered naked?
Obviously not.
Because the Gameboy has colors.
is a person with only a shirt considered naked
No.
-.-
http://metroid.retropixel.net/metroid2/screenshots/metroid2_28.gif
ponies are never "considered naked" cause their customs don't werk liek dat
That's half-naked.
half- NEIGHked
He's butt naked! Get it
more liek halfbaked, graphics hahahalolol
(-.(\)
lol
half- NEIGHked
SuperBrony64????

Concepts would be confusing for ponies... so they dont have religion cuz that seems to start a shitton of issues in real life
!cd
Episode 11 of season 3 "Keep Calm and Flutter On" airs in 19 days, 7 hours, 1 minutes, 39 seconds (Jan 19 15:30:00 2013 UTC)
you failed at dailing
Werewolf Queen, it's always Werewolf Queen.
ponies are good with concepts
How?
they are also good with a side of fries
did you see that article where they basically created Plato's Republic?
what
Considering next episode is named "Keep Calm and Flutter On", I can guess two things.
1. It's about Fluttershy.
1, dont let me eat pears
i hate pears
ok, sorry go on
2. It is based off a meme, and will probably be targeted at that now more popular older audience
my brothers dog attackted my cat :<
The meme being "Keep Calm and "anything inserted here)
berberborscing, >Meme
never actually HERD of that meme
seriously?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On
I've seen T-Shirts
I recently got a Pinkie Pie card box.
http://www.overthinkingit.com/2012/11/08/my-little-pony-plato/
I was all, :O:O:O:O:O
Because it was a present that was a day oer two lat
*late, and I was happy it wasn't lost
So I was happy, and being happy made me want to dance.
SO I DID
I stopped reading after I realized that the haters will flee to this.
Anyway, 'sup?
That is, when I hovered the link.
it's a historic fact
That say stuff like "Keep Calm and Eat Cookies:
It's not a meme.
Waitwut
this is evil why is this gunna be a mlp title...
How did i get a 6 in 10?
"Keep Calm and Do Homework" (obviously the work of a teavher)
well guess what that is referencing
I know the sypnosis for the episode but I'm not allowed to spoil it since it's against the rules.
HISTORIC FACTS
lets hope its not
yea thanks fer not sayin it
me no want spiolars
Keep Calm and Carry On spread on Twitter.
Not from teachers.
/me slaps Spell-of-Gaming around a bit with a large trout

Well, it is New Year's EVE
As in, evening.
Not Eve Online
yea im spending the night at home
but im working today
but not tommorow
I will, playing Animal Crossing. .3.
i think i will play zelda
Or at least games that have an event for New Year's Eve.
whihc animal crossing?
City Folk
how old are you? -shot-
My country is near Japan. So, yeah, I'll find Japanese MMOs. ^w^
i only played animal crossing o.O
This slide show needs more milkshakes
for the gamecube..
and resetti always got mad
I'm also involved in an upcoming fansite for Animal Crossing right now
It'll be done by 2013, I'm pretty sure.
does resetti apper in the one you play?
Resetti appears in every Animal Crossing game, actually.
If you repeatedly reset, he'll start making you type stuff.
even his brother?
i been to that part
he yells also
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #539
As far as I know, yeah.
Typing in City Folk is pretty hard without a USB Keyboard.
Honestly, I would've paid extra for a keyboard.
what is city folk for?
Well, it's an upgrade from the previous game, Wild World.
oh
i remember
You can visit the city mainly.
i used to use my gameboy adavance
for the mini game?
Well i'm off to bed guys, good night ^_^
what is sleep?
aniderp|bestcakeever: something i need :D
Yeah, it's possible to connect your GBA to your GC to visit the island freely.
Sometimes a whale can pop up while riding the boat.
But it's hidden
As a shadow, like a fish.

Gold_Demona: hai :D
RoboGerbil: People usually are. XD
The Euros and the Aussies usually are anyway
ohai aniderp|bestcakeever =)
im gonna try baileys tonoight im excited!
Bailey's is really good. =)
then im gonna be a good girl and wait till im 21
I'm up and I'm in Texas
Further west than me. I'm in Florida. :D
arent you all proud of me?
pfft no
I probably won't either :P
Good for you, aniderp|bestcakeever =)
My husband never had such drinks until he was 21. Cuz he's a boring stiff like that. :P
but i promised you lot i would wait till 21
I tried sneaking a beer once when I was really little and it was nasty as fuck. I'm not tempted to try drinking.
Good on you :>
but it is special occasion so its ok right?
dem three comments in that short amount of time
aniderp|bestcakeever: Honestly, it makes no difference to me. As long as you're happy about the decision, that's all that matters
but like i said.. i gotta be really careful
since i on meds
Dis: Beer is an acquired taste. Also I had to try many bad ones before finding a beer I liked. =/
Cheap beer is crap
is bud lite lime good?
in Australia, you can drink when you're 18
Meh. Not a fan of any Bud
OF course, I have no plans on drinking at all in my life.
I usually drink Yuenling.
yuengling*
should i let myself pour tonight or have someone else pour?
aniderp|bestcakeever: If you're at a party with strangers, always pour your own drink
wait... i dont think i have red solo cup
its at home
Then it should be fine as long as the one pouring isn't an asshole.
i will let my brother do it if he home
he poured last one
Cool
knowing me i would be shaky and pour too much
Yeah, that'd be bad

My hubby and I area spending the new year at my mom's house.
As soon as he gets off work today we'll head over there
well Im gonna get beer only if the stores are not closed. They usually are after noon...
Gold_Demona: is that a good thing?
Gold_Demona: just because stereotypically one does not like the in laws and vice versa
Alchemist: Yeah, New Years at my mom's is always fun. And my uncle's gonna be there, so my hubby will have another man to talk to. :D
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: wolfie? o.o
We get along with our in-laws just fine. =)

Of course each of us prefers the company of our own parents, but that's to be expected. XD
Normally anyway
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Okies, you're best wolfie :3
Good evening BronyState
Hi Ducky =D
Gold_Demona: lucky you then :) My brother have issues with his in laws. Or more like the other way around. Last time they talked to our side of the family was more than 2 years ago (since the wedding :D )
3 hours till New Years here
19 hours until new years here. XP
About 14 hours left here
Gold_Demona! :)
Hi MadSurge =D
MadSurge: Guess what I'm watching. >.>
Gold_Demona: ponies? :P

What are... Ponies? o.o
I dunno then :D

I have never heard of such a word
A let's play of LLL"Lupin La Morte, Zenigata L'amore"... Yes, I'm a dork. XP
Ok this is bugging the crap out of me
Where'd all those extre L's come from? O_o
Gold_Demona: yaaaay :D I am bad at stealth games though
Im playing OOT 3d and Im in the water temple and I seem to be missing a key and I h=the only two chests i havent opened I cant reach without said key and I have 0
MadSurge: Me too, but I have the one and only English-dub Lupin game anyway. :P
Gold_Demona: :D
I wish THIS game was the one we got in English dub. The story is MUCH better in this game. And it looks like a lot more fun. :<
Fucking water temple...the temple its self isnt hard...this key bullshit is pissing me off
has anyone played with FTL? I dunno if I should buy it...
Gold_Demona: well I had a pirate copy of a quite well made PS1 game of Fist of the North Star at one point, all in Japanese
If I ever win the lottery, I'd get myself a european playstation just so I can play this game.
there is a difference between consoles depending on the continent? O_O
Same restrictions as DVDs
but...why?
AdamTheDuck: hey
Hello wipergone2
AdamTheDuck: can i show u somthing
I know, I think europe is divided into 2 regions
Such a great song :$
They're coded different so they're not compatible with foreign machines
Which is stupid
lolol wtf is this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuA_Z4iAybg

Alchemist: Other than to prevent illegal imports? I dunno.
Also Ocarina of Time 3d completly makes the water temple easy, it has marking for the water level directions and a camera shot for a easily missed key
SpadeKyurem: here's mine: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfchvCyHmsc
Ocarina of Time 3d? Wasn't the original ALREADY in 3d? O_o
Gold_Demona: Updated graphics
And some stuff was changed
But, it was already 3d...
Gold_Demona: 3DS version
Ah
You know whats really funny?
Master quest water temple is patheticly easy
And that is supposed to be the hard mode
Gold_Demona: in this age where most movies and games are acquired from the net (and I mean legally), is that really a problem?
SpadeKyurem: that's because they knew they made it too hard in the original game :D
Alchemist: There are region restrictions on the internet as well.
MadSurge: Its not that hard
SpadeKyurem: also, cows on the walls
People overreact
MadSurge: God that is so weird
Alchemist: Which is why most folks outside the US can't legally acquire English-speaking ponies
Biggoron sword is best weapon
Gold_Demona: well, that just shows how much money I spend on this stuff. I had no idea :D
You do require an absurd amount of stuff to get it though SpadeKyurem
MadSurge: not really
I did it right before I did any of the temples
And my god Dark Link is pathetic with it
I don't really like timed missions :D
Also from what I heard theres a cut temple in OOT
The whole area you go when you free a sage was supposed to be a hub of some sorts
Alchemist: There are places that sell "region-free" players that can play any dvd no matter where it's from.
Alchemist: I just wish that was the case with Playstation 2's =/
But alas there's no such thing as a region-free PS2
Also never ever bother getting all the golden skultulas in the game, the reward is pointless
Gold_Demona: Oh well, emulators I guess :D
00,10well there is Gold_Demona, but only developers have them
¬_¬
Hello Sumica! :)
00,10used them alot at actvision
00,10they have dark blue cases.
That doesn't really count, sumi. Normal people can't buy them. :P
00,10you are right, I am not normal
:D
I can't fall asleep ;_;
Try counting sheep?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/353/ my face when I find out I missed a passage at one end of the dungeon when I wasted my time going to the other end trying to find a key
Gold_Demona, Stuff like that doesn't work for me
nevermind not gonna do was i was gonna do
hey
Ponies47: Warm milk and honey.
Ponies47, because this?: http://i.imgur.com/hW57z.jpg
One thing I like about OOT 3d is when you pull out the Ocarina you can pull up a song sheet while you have it up so easy song list
:3
00,10so want more of me softly rageing at ftl?
sure
Sumica, hehe ok :$
lol soft raging
Is there a term for someone who collects shit in a game even though you dont really need to?
Sumica: yes please! :)
SpadeKyurem: Completionist?

>here is my fully automatic supressed knife
Gold_Demona, Yeah that doesn't work either
Even though I know the reward for getting every gold skultula is pointless I feel compelled to get everyone I come across
Ponies47: Swift blow to the head with a large blunt object?
xD
The hell is this?
SpadeKyurem: Yep. Completionist. That's what you are
XAX, hehe :$
/me looks around for something to hit himself in the head with
Guess what the pointless reward is
4chan just taught me about flutterrape. I'm confused.
infinite money
Yay, infinite money!
But you get it at the point of the game when its usless
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
Money? o.o

ipod been running like a long time
I wish I had an idea of what the hell Im watching
but it took breaks
Pew pew
should i give my ipod a reset?
Also Im on brony state at almost 5:00 AM what am I doing with my life?
been on since 2 am
SpadeKyurem: go to bed!
AdamTheDuck I remember just loving being a demo in killing floor. I literally just loved having two nade launchers to blow tons of enemies away with and pipe bombs yes pipe bombs :D
Hello Bronies!!!
-pokes madsurge-
killerpony7733, I live having my friends depend on the only medic because apparently no one wants to play medic but me >.>
love*
AdamTheDuck Awww
Medic is fun when your team is good.
killerpony7733, then if they were a dick to me I'd just deprive them of heals XD
Oh good times
Medic gun is a bit wonky though at times.
Seriously what the heck am I watching?
SpadeKyurem, we're watching Sumi play FTL
FTL
FTL?
and watching him flip tables when he dies
Faster Than Light
faster than light
was an indie hit last summer
Well Morpha got utterly wrecked, he didnt even get an attack off on me
Rabble Rabble
best laser in the game
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/05b46c474d1710ac3a9cdaa25d572482.png WORTH IT :D
I don't get it. Is this a reference to some obscure TV show?
They could have been killed! MadSurge
She took them right into the... DANGER ZONE
FTL = For the lose
:p
Also is it me or do I see Wildfire in that comic MadSurge ?
this is bad
SpadeKyurem: that pink OC was supposed to be Wildfire, so in the comic she switches between the two :D
im back
sorry
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a8d8497594ee4e9f3930a8d968284dfe.png :3 awwwww
They're not having a nice quiet Heart's Warming ;_;
The first game I played, some joker set fire to the door-room in Sector 1, and I friggin' carried it for two sectors before dying.
the episode from last saturday was originally written for derpy, not for spike
hello Bronystates
hi Lil_B
but then hasbro euthanized her
hi Lil_B
thanks Gold_Demona and DaringDerpy
DaringDerpy: o rly?
Euthanized... seriously?
because she was handicapped
never allowed on screen again
DaringDerpy would make sense, but stil, this Episode was Painful to watch :/
yes...
DaringDerpy: I think that Hasbro tries to avoid anything we like.
But seriosuly... Euthanized? Isn't that a little dramatic?
DaringDerpy: That would explain why they needed something to replace the episode with, and why they gave us crap for this episode.
I still fail to see how Derpy was offensive
right
Gold_Demona: drama? you have no heart for ponies
:P
We're finally past 9>2012
well, here at least
not here
been 2013 for 5 mins or so
I just think it's silly to put such dramatic terminology on a cartoon character.
Still 10:04 here
XAX: LOL
still 2012 here :I
XAX: Celebrate the new year by using colors.
:)
how does it feel XAX?
Gold_Demona: we are talking about derpy here
It's 6am New Years Eve here. Still have the rest of the day before it's 2013 here. :P
DaringDerpy: average
XAX lives in the future :3
Whom will Celebrate New Year on Bronystate?
DaringDerpy: I know! But she's a cartoon character! She's not dead!
I think I will, Lil_B
I probably will.
And yeah, Hasbro is preventing the show from being what it could be.
She was never alive to begin with!
DaringDerpy nice, sso I'm nbot alone :)
Gold_Demona: stop confusing me with your facts!
Lil_B: not sure if I will get drunk or not
So am I missing anything if I skip, Spike at your service?
NO
NOT MISSING A THING
^
So it was crap then
I liked the episode, personally. =/
XAX my Timezone will exceed yours oin every aspect, just you wait!
SpadeKyurem: it has a nice twilight ocd moment
Season 3 was going so great and then one episode tottaly bombs
http://i.imgur.com/f9FOc.png
best part of the whole episode
The episode was the worst of the series, I like Spike, and I think that he was a good character, but this episode completely killed every good characteristic about him. He was portrayed as a tool in this episode, and allowed all the characters to look down to him. I miss season 1, where he cared what other ponies thought of him.
DaringDerpy: Wut
I'll take a look on the S3 Episode list, butr so far, it reaslly didn't impress me :P
RIP Spike
KrazyNoobs: Spike is pretty much a tool to rarity to begin with
Unless they make a spike episode sometime in the future that is really good.
Hehe, happy new year XAX :P
Not sure whether to celebrate with 09,00 or 04,12... (jks)
oh, right, happy new year! :)
So was a good episode replaced with said episode or what?
Episode 11 will be about Spike again
... damnit
no one likes spike
according to the title i mean
I like SPike :<
we need more twilight sparkle episodes
im just going to leave this here: http://i.imgur.com/w1MNh.jpg
like in season 1
Still 6 hours before I reach new year. But I don't really care about new year....
Spike really has nothing to do these days
But yeah, Season 3 was only good with episode 3, 5, 6 and 7. (only my opinion, everypony has different opinions). Season 1 is my fav.
He's just a fax machine esentally
Sumica, it's generally good to make sure that the engines, shields, weapons, and helm are manned. You'll shoot faster, recharge shields faster, and dodge more.
The problem with this game is that the ship is just too damn small.
I agree, KrazyNoobs. They were the good ones
My Favs of S3 have been... mmmm... the wonderbolt erpisode (even if it was kinda shallow) and maybe one bad seed
So did At your service replace an episode or what?
Even Voyager have at least over 100 crew members.
SpadeKyurem: rumours say they replaced a character, everything else was roughly the same
Season 3, overall, lacks the amazing character each of the Mane 6 displayed in Season 1.
Even Andromeda have robots!
Lil_B, :D
3 hours until new year here in Australia.
:)
18 here
use the lvl3 laser
I think overall Season 3 work well.
the beam can't break the shield
Also Wonderbolt Academy actually help RD character grew up.
Lightning Dust seems like a realt= bitch though
Season 3's only good character is Pinkie, in my opinion. I like how they made her more random.
*real
KrazyNoobs: Like she isnt already
She was supposed to be, but the way she just got escorded away without a word at the end was rather anticlimatic
SpadeKyurem: She is. People try to connect her with Trixie. The problem is Trixie is just a boasting mare while LD willing to let other ponies die for her own gain.
Lightning DFust I mean
There's one character i would like to see in Baby form. Fluttershy! =) i'm sure everyone would die ^^
I hope Lightning Dust got kicked out of the acedemy for that shit
Hmm, i enjoyed all but the latest ep, the story just seemed too forced and not quite believeable.
But yeah, Hasbro isn't letting MLP:FiM go to its potential.
Except for Canterlot Wedding
A Canterlot Wedding showed how good the show could be.
But that was already huge with Baby Applejack don't you agree?
Although the plot was a little rushed.
Although the logic even for a cartoon went out the window for that episode
Alot
HASHTAGyolo
lol
Lil_B: Nice way to avoid getting in trouble for advertising other channels. XD
Also Wonderboly Academy shows that Dash willing to lose her biggest dream if that dream endanger the life of her friends and her principal. That's Loyalty to ya
KrazyNoobs :P
DaringDerpy: Diabeetus achieved
Ohai oni_link :3
/me pat filly Fluttershy's head.
When I watch that episode, if Lightning Dust doesnt get kicked out of the academy I will flip my shit
I wanna see another Rarity Episode and see the writers try their hardest to not make it about generosity :P
hiyo Ponies47 :3
i see you still cant sleep Ponies47 :3
hello oni_link and Ponies47 :)
SpadeKyurem: Maybe she will be kicked out. Or court martialed. Or join Celestia's black ops :/
Lil_B: Cant be that hard given how un generous Rarity can be
http://www.mlponline.net/attachments/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-baby-mane-six-gif.2598/
SpadeKyurem awww, she is only generous when she needs to be :P
My only gripe with Wonderbolt Academy is that it seems to be retconning the previous episode about RD becoming Scootaloo's stepsister. Later episodes have RD in the cast as if Wonderbolt Academy never happened, or ended differently.
I mean if somepony almost kills ponies to succeed you dont deserve to be a wonderbolt
oni_link, I can't sleep agian! XD
Hey Lil_B :3
Ponies47: Its okay, neither can I XD
hey guys
and hi Lil_B I finally caught you XD
Although I have to fault Twilight and friends to being on clouds in the fucking first place
oni_link I suggest to ujse a Masterball
so I am sitting here, posting pictures of cartoon baby ponies. wtf happened to me?
something is wrong
DaringDerpy, ponies happened. Ponies.
oni_link, It's 5:20 AM and I'm not the least bit sleepy. Opreation all nighter is a go :P
Lil_B: But I used it on Zapdos :(
SpadeKyurem: I think Rarity going a little bit un-generous I don't think that's the truth. I mean she just asking for shallow stuff. And "over-generous" are worse.
death?
Ponies47: woo hooo :3
Escape?
There goes the crew
Even if what Lightning Dust was uncalled for, being unprotected on clouds is asking for disaster
boooo
*did
'
/me chugs another can of soda ' Whooooo! PARTY!"
oni_link that's why you keep it until you can use the Item Multiplier-Glitch
The captain is like "We will fight everyone!"
/me licks oni_link
:P
So im chalking it up to half Lightning being a total selfish bitch and half Twilight and friends being complete morons
Lil_B: missingno o,o he turned into a lapras
hi AdamTheDuck :3
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
SpadeKyurem: What? at least they are coming prepared with cloud walking spell.
/me noms on Lil_B's ear :3
mah Eeeerrr
Also visiting a friend isn't what we consider "moronic"
Java: That still doesnt acount for any danger of being KNOCKED OFF
No one ever thought of that
SpadeKyurem: The tornado is too sudden.
good start, Sumica
Its called being prepared
No one can expect to avoid a sudden tornado
Also couldent fluttershy fucking fly?
I'm considering getting sdomething to eat :/
I swear! Sumica's having MUCH worse luck than I get.
SpadeKyurem: No. Let say that there's an earthquake somewhere. Did the victim get the blame? no.
Lil_B: will you come back after?
worst start I've ever seen
awesome
oni_link I usually plan too (I have no other place to stay :( )
oni_link something important?
Lil_B: youre always welcome here, and I was just curious :P
Java: You're missing the point, Twilight should have been prepared for any kind of danger, even if it was sudden, theres always a possibility for something to go horribly wrong
Why I'm I so much in a Synthazither mood since a few month >.<
SpadeKyurem: You can't predict everything. Did you carry 4 spare tires in case ALL your tires blow out?
Of course not
Did your car carry all kind of car spare parts just in case? of course not
Lil_B: synth is nice :P
EVEN SO, they should have made sure they would land safely in ANY SCENARIO
Did you go out with a complete set of first aid kit all day everyday? of course not.
SpadeKyurem but timber wolves don't usaully venture out of the everfree let along close to the edges of it apart from when the zap apples are going to grow and since twilight didn't know any of hte signs had happened how could she know
Java: Missing the fucking point man....
oni_link I mean really retro sounding ones :) (I'll give you a link :) )
SpadeKyurem: No, you're missing the point completteli
completely
oh, sry
a bit long
dat link
Lil_B: yay
Right because me pointing out being on a cloud suspended high in the air with no form of protection is missing the point
You can't expect a passenger plane to intercept a missile from jet fighters.
Right....
right
Java: So you're going to miss the fucking point they were on a cloud high in the air with no protection whats so ever
Thats MY POINT
lol spade are you being serious right now
or are you trolling
Wowza, getting serious over this?
Java, I don't know. You probably could if the plane is flying into an active combat zone.
You must be really bored.
Kandarihu: The problem is the academy is a friendly zone
Yeah, because magical reassembling wolves are not scary
FiW http://i.imgur.com/fgG57.jpg
No once can expect a sudden tornado. Especially in a realm where you can control your weather.
Again..being that high up in the air with no form of protection is suicide
Java, yes, but it's a place where that sort of things should be expected.
maybe at a weather school but not a flying school
Kandarihu: Even it's not likely that the event could happened suddenly.
It's like asking all car owners to install roll bars in case of the car rolling out of control.
Oh for the love of god
Given the stakes of the competition, a sudden tornado CAN be expected to happen if any candidate's raw talent exceeds her/his discipline, as was the case with Lightning Dust.
So you dont think having ANY FORM OF PROTECTION on a fucking cloud on that hight is not needed
but twilight had no idea what the competition was like
SpadeKyurem: They don't expect someone to create a sudden tornado. Not even Spitfire.
Java: Its called being prepared
Also RD admit it was very reckless and dangerous.
It's OVER prepared for something we don't know yet.
Right...because not expecting sompony to pull shit is over prepared
maybe tornado protection would be a good idea at a weather school but not a flight school
i mean it;s not something that you would really expect to happen
It's like saying that we must WALLED EVERY BEACH in Aceh.
We don't
So when we got hit we lost a lot.
I love that new Youtube glitch with the unstoppable music.
Java: I fail to get how you dont think being unprotected on a really high up on a cloud is not stupid in the slightest
its a freakin cloud, man
a cloud
So you dont think ponies who CANT FLY SHOULD HAVE NO PROTECTION, ok I get it then
Sigh. You sounds like a broken record. I just woke up and already arguing on the internet. If you can't read my reasonings so be it.
Go ahead and wall every beach. Go ahead and put a huge net on every sides of the academy. Go ahead and put animal traps all around forests.
Java: You arent gettingn what Im trying to say...the fact is..they had no protecting from any possiblity for ponies who cant fucking fly
this is hilarious
It isn't hilarious, it's embarassing.

2012 was good, yes
For bronies, that is

SuperBrony64; silly :§
I can imagine the recruitment poster for this fleet: "Join the Starfleet and DIE!"

http://i.imgur.com/l45WT.jpg
SpadeKyurem, like I said earlier, my first attempt at this game was largely spent with a huge fire emanating from my door room.
VioletGreySha, O3O
I don't think 2012 was good for bronies
don't have a good feeling for 2013 though
Ponies47; =3
2012....
We didn't have a lot of episodes
was hurt myself ;_;
Im starting to wonder if this game could give I wanna be the guy a run for its money in sheer dickery
thinking about bad things to myself
DaringDerpy: 2014 is when I guess it will all end for the bronies... I hope I'm wrong.
SpadeKyurem: You don't play Kaizou Mario World? that game is sadistic.
we will get the first fanmade episode soon
Java: Forgot that one
hope it becomes a habit
Did somepony say Kaizu Mario World? O_O
LOL
KrazyNoobs: Yes. Be afraid of that game.
Save state over and over again, lol
Save state is your friend
KrazyNoobs: SNES9X....
rocks are immune to fire ^^
Java: I use ZSNES
My dad smashed my SNES with a hammer a few months ago...
KrazyNoobs: Dare I ask why?
btw, space pauses the game
KrazyNoobs: I'm talking about someone who trolled his friend who play Kaizou Mario World with save state.
My cousin had that for like 5 years before he gave it to me. I've had it for like 15 years.
The challenge is NOT to use save states too often.
maybe 2013 will be better for me..
no cloak for you
who thinks it will?
SuperBrony64 is asleep guys....LETS BOTHER HIM
you're poor
My dad was mad at me, SpadeKyurem, and he did that as a punishment. A lot of memories in that thing.
/me slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
How about no?
jaymoo?
No to what Jmo?o.o
KrazyNoobs: Ok why the fuck didnt he just TAKE IT AWAY, WHY SMASH IT
aniderp, I'm not gonna play 20Q with your life.
That is really uncalled for
The no was to bothering SB.
Save states are a function of most console emulators, that basically dumps the entire contents of the ingame RAM to a file to quickly return to an earlier point in the game.
SpadeKyurem: He could have sold it for a lot.
How do I PM people?
While I can understand a mental punishment, why even bother smashing something that is pretty valuable?
SpadeKyurem: But yeah, when I was around 4, I started playing some games.
i wondered if you wanted a cookie o.O
Sell a SNES for alot, rofl.
Java, /msg <target> <message>
Java: See that list of people to the side? Double click on one. Or you can type /query <Nickname>
Java you see the list of names double click the name of the person you want to pm
thanks. I will send you a video link KrazyNoobs :)
Java: I've played it before.
KrazyNoobs: Your dad's a dick
Java: It was made with that Super Mario World Modder, I think it was LunarMagic.
Well, savestates don't work like FTL saves. A real savestate will stay there until it's overridden.
SpadeKyurem: Well, one can not judge another just by one bad action. Overall, he was good.
bl2 tiem
Well smashing a console just to punish someone is not called for
Ooh Borderlands 2?
Take the damn thing away not wreck it
SpadeKyurem: It was an overreaction in my opinion.
Oh hai luna
Awake at 6 AM here...what is wrong with me
Awake at 6 AM?
That won't do.
My school needs me before 7

You love swearing don't you?
>Mouse 4
Lol what
Never understood what Mouse 4 even meant'
I know Mouse 1-3
But I dont use those mice that are like
8 different buttons
http://i.imgur.com/jHh8V.png
I have no idea, SpadeKyurem
Mouse 4 lyfe
lool
Why would a mouse have 8 buttons?
You only neeed 3...
What game?
For MMORPG purposes.
^
I play wow with a three button mouse and I dont have a issue
What game is being streamed right now?
So I dont see the point
That's your perspective.
SpadeKyurem, who said it's an issue?
To others it is easier.
SpadeKyurem, the extra buttons are for people who want further customistion >.>
Well 8 buttons seems like overkill
Is this Borderlands 2? :I
Invoker, indeed it is
Yep
BUTT STALLION
HERE GIRL
Ohai MLP_Brovakiin
Goodmorning everyone :)
Ohai AdamTheDuck :p

Google is your friend and he really doesn't.

7 proxies? Wut?
Hello, Spell-o-Gaming

I spend a lot of time on KnowYourMeme and YouTube.
A LOT of time.
Java: I'm on TVTropes a lot too.
I edit mostly anime pages, though.
Welcome to the best timewaster of the internet
Bitch, please, I've been on there since 2008.
Maybe earlier
You're old.
I'm 18
and I'm back :/ I ate well for 1 €
There is no best waste of time on the internet.
In internet time you're a grandpa
Welcome back Lil_B :)
Inb4 Nintendo's Pokemon announcement on January 8 is only the Pokemon Ranch update
Most of the things on the internet is a waste of time
Java: Srsly? :/
Except ponies
g--
Spell-of-Gaming: Don't really care much for Pokemon anymore. My member name has only stuck because it's from my childhood.
thanbks MLP_Brovakiin :)
Java: IE the G word
G? Google?
What is, Google? google google google
The forbidden word
its google google google
Is that anything like gak gak ga- *banned*
No one remember the era of Altavista
*kicked
Java: the age of what?
Damn it, I really need to stop that and OMFG ALTAVISTA.
Those were the days
SpadeKyurem: LOL yep. The day where it took 5-10 minutes to download a pic.
During new episodes, some people try to get dubs with their g-- kicks.
That was last time
Before the new episode
My download speed is slow as hell /thirdworldproblems
Spell-of-Gaming: heheheh
Spell-of-Gaming: I learned how to wait by using dial-up as a kid.
Got a new desktop. connection is crap...why
But you still in this streaming site, it means it's not that bad.
you mean *ak kicks?
I'm able to download a 4GB game in about an hour.
I spent 24 hours downloading a 20 GB game.
The 4GB game in question is the Clannad visual novel.
I downloaded wow in about 4 hours I think
And WoW is like 22 GB
meh
Wurld urf WurlCrooft
WoW is now game about pandas for kids
with cartoon sounds
THAT EXISTET IN LORE FOR AWHILE
Bitch, you best not be dissing pandas.
I think WOW is popular because it can run on old PCs.
Not everyone build high end PCs.
I get freaking pissed when people ignore the fact the Pandaren were in WoW lore for a long freaking time
"just you know why...."
Only MMO I play is Fantasy Online, which is a simplistic Flash-based MMO.
And even then I only play it for an hour at a time, at most.
Wut.
Next year I'm going to try the completely revamped FF14. I saw the video and it's so damn good. I hope they fix most of the problems.
Lol.
Welp.
That answers that.
I spend longer playing Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition. Play sessions on that can last three to four hours if I'm on a roll.
/me LOVES old shooters.
Play WoW all day ery day
Where did KrazyNoobs2 go?
ded maybe?
Does anyone else love it when characters mistake your gender?
No, SHockwave crashed on the BronyState page for KrazyNoobs2.
KrazyNoobs: Did you find that pond?
And their reaction is priceless.
Java: dun
*fun
oh no
Oh, he's connecting right now.
KrazyNoobs2, he just connected.
KrazyNoobs3, she is still on.
And yes, I like to give them different identities.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
lol
OMG PONY
pony_6548: HAHAHAHAHA
not that face again]
meh
( ͡° the eyes are not recognized °) i think.
Only the nose and mouth can be detected
Welp
Is that another script? ( ° ͜ʖ °)
sure is.
Man handsome Jack is cruel
Sound?
No, you can do it without the nose and mouth.'
. ͜ . kag
ʖ the nose
Sound kinda went poop there for a sec.
pony_6548: Man, you foals always make me laugh.
i'm not foal
but i like making you laugh anyway :)
pony_6548: :)
Luna's scream is... unsettling
Just cleaned out my hard drive some. Now I have 12.5 GB of free space as opposed to the 7 or so I did have.
pony_6548: Foal, as in g-- typers or lenny face users.
hahahaha
Piss-for-brains? LOLOLOL
also my stuff disagree about my foalnes
(oʖo)
and this is just funny face o3o
Lennyface is a bad meme that needs to die in a horrible fire.
The nose looks like a retarded 3.
A gasoline fire, preferrably
What makes Lennyface awesome is the fact that it can get you in trouble on a few places of the internet.
ie. le lenny face is bannable on 4chan
and here
Just started a new Animal Crossing: Wild World game. Only 3 neighbors. Creepy as hell. o3o
Because it's an annoying-as-all-fuck forced meme with no meaning.
Do you know the difference between kickable and bannable?
meh, pony also bannable at 4chan
not anymore
oh already
SPLATTER
They have a board for us (but it has been taken over by idiots anyway).
I think Im gonna go to bed, night everyone
Night oni_link!
Yeah, 4Chan's always been a shitpit. I'm not surprised that /mlp/ has become a wretched hive as well.
night oni_link
Goodnight oni_link
put that cookie down!
Check out the board for cringe-worthy posts.
KrazyNoobs Rarely ever, though.
Sumi, your master can suck it.
It's rare that's there's actual discussion, but it can also turn into a shithole.
kill this bucket of junk!
I avoid 4c. But when I went there I always check Photography. There's actual discussion to be had.... sometimes.
*ear phones unplugged*
THIS WAY!

it's funny because he's a midget
HAPPY NEW YEAR
4chan /mlp/ might actually be a place I'd enjoy if it were void of so many cloppers.
Naiga
Of course, I still enjoy it, because there's always going to be a good thread somewhere in that mass of... you know...

/me parachutes into the chat and
I was in this body
what time in Australia for now ? :D
Phase4 so the diamonds in storage were from creative ?
pony_6548, 00:11 1/1/2013
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, BUDDY!!!
oh
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, yeah
you're from the future!
Phase4: 11;11pm here
DUBS
Phase4, where do you live?
rdibp, victoria
Phase4 well i haven't explored the mine cause i'll show you where is later
we're in daylight savings time so its an hour earlier than it should be

Phase4, did a revolution break out yet?
well the fireworks exploded but that was intentional
rdibp, not yet
What should my wallpaper be? I narrowed it down to 3 choices: http://goo.gl/ZwtWz , http://goo.gl/CEaDF , or http://goo.gl/5IJy6

clap-trap ded
I live on top of a hill in Noosa, QLD, so I have 3 different firework displays on beaches to watch, one 10km away, one 15km and one 10km the other way.
Kipkat07_Scarf, i'd say one or 3
Kipkat07_Scarf: The first one... the idea is good but it need better presentation. A block of white and a black font seems.... boring.
rdibp rdibp rdibp
That was hard to type
/me glomps Phase4
/me wipes Phase4
/me hugs Kipkat07_Scarf back
rdibp.... Rainbow Dash in Black Phantom?
:D
KrazyNoobs, lern 2 tab complete
I would say congradulations but for the life of me I cant figure if that is how to spell it
Phase4: wut?
Phase4 follow me to the supernintendo hideout
KrazyNoobs, type part of a name and then press tab
ph + Tab = Phase4
yes
Niiiiiiiiiiiiice

Phase4 al in one box
lawl
The "ending" of S3EP2 where they all became crystals was horrible. Me thinks it was to advertise them crystal Mane 6.
KrazyNoobs: everything put into MLP is an advertising gimmick
KrazyNoobs: Promoting a new line of toys.
Phase4: do you think this is a good wallpaper? http://wallpoper.com/images/00/42/36/55/butterfly-shining_00423655.jpg or rather this: http://stuffpoint.com/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/image/83670-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-flutter-black.png
Phase4 youl never find my secret hideout where me a sb live
I know, Hasbro sucks.
yay... not a total linkwall failure
Hasbro sucks too. Studio B is where its at!
Laziness wins again
the people who make show are canadian
Hasbro is the only thing preventing MLP from being at its full potential.
But Hasbro has to be involved in it... they own the entire My Little Pony franchise.
KrazyNoobs: what then?
what if the show reached full potential?
Kipkat07_Scarf: Derpy. nuff said
KrazyNoobs: i think we mightve syumbled across a parodox. :O
stumbled*
6_9
Der
p
ohai erpy :)
Hi Depry
Derpy*
Hi Derpy
dem two spellin errors
To this day I fail to see how Derpy was considered pffensive
*offensive
SpadeKyurem: Cos people are stupid.
Handicapped people are offensive, somehow. Wouldn't that make handicapped viewers of the show feel bad?
KrazyNoobs: The Derpy crisis was proof that the general population is unprepared for MLP's full potential.
Kipkat07_Scarf: Or the fact people are retarded
KrazyNoobs: We have to accept the good and the bad. Just like Transformers.
How the hell was Derpy making fun of ANYONE
in the end without Hasbro we won't get ponies
I fail to see how
Welcome to Earth! Where shows like Family Guy and South Park can get away with anything. But, if you show a cross-eyed pony on a kids show, WE WILL SLAM IT!
Kipkat07_Scarf: And if the bronies are the only thing keeping My Little Pony from dying (which gives money to Hasbro, which is all they care about), why not at least do what is best for them?
rdibp: Thank you
What would happen if The Hub bought My little Pony off of Hasbro?
KrazyNoobs: Political Correctness.
Soon we will march on the Capitol. We can force their hand. Once we have a first world power's support... we will be unstoppable.
not possible, but what would happen?
Brony world order?
hAM!
Java: exactly.
You know why Derpy is "offensive" because over protective soccermoms OVER ANYALYZE EVERYTHING
kipkat07_Scarf: this is why people hate us XD
SpadeKyurem: Hasbro needs to ignore them.
rdibp: people still watch Family Guy and South Park? Haven't those shows jumped the shark a million years ago?
[22:59] <@JRP2234> SuperBrony64 i stole your cheese
[23:04] <@SuperBrony64> dat mah cheese D:
NO IT ISNT YOU STUPID CHUCKLENUTS, just because it LOOKS offensive doenst mean it isnt
God humanity is retarded sometimes...
JRP2234: since WHEN were you mods?
O_o
MadSurge: I said shows LIKE amily guy and south park
nevars
rdibp: Im insane. The fandom is filled with sane fellows but Im not one of them.
also rdibp brings up a good point
mods 6_9
JRP2234: What is with the @ in your name then? HM?
rdibp: you mean every cartoon from Adult Swim? :D
its means i was op
sort of :P
Futurama is in Season 7 and is still good
Hello!
Why is a cross eyed pony considered offensive when Family Guy can get away with shit
How is everypony?
when you got bigger balls on size this @
And yet noone says anything to Adventure Time, despite being for kids and showing way worse imagery
i don't even watch new episodes of family guy anymore
once we can implement the brony world order, we can actually follow "Love & Tolerace"
SpadeKyurem: Because overprotective moms who just want to find a reason to complain to someone or something don't have young kids that watch that show (DUH!)
You want to know why aliens havent invaded yet? because they take ONE look at us and turn RIGHT AROUND AND LEAVE
till then... we are an unorganised minority.
I dont believe in Love and Tolerence. It was just created by someone on 4-Chan to stop all the arguments
