So, want to learn a fun math fact from one of my students' quizzes? :D
we know :3
Sure CriticKitten.
guys help me help you by helping me change my name to something
A bike traveling at 18 feet per second is traveling just over 1 million miles per hour, according to one of my students.
Coldays: SUR CREWAM
hello everyone
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjF032TDDQ Tacos?
hello naturesfury
Hi, naturesfury. :)
Hi naturesfury :)
no stream on tonight?
hi naturesfury
CriticKitten: :D
So apparently bike travel is the secret to unlocking warp drive
naturesfury: sup sucka?
Did I just read correctly.
Dafuq.
SUR CREWAM huh
Is this student in special ed?
QUE?! :D
Yeah, a kid put that on his quiz as his answer. Didn't even hesitate for a second to think "that doesn't make sense". But the best part of this story?
You're gonna give him top score?
The three idiots sitting next to him didn't stop to think about it, either.
:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfokAHwGud0
:D
So, special ed, right?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/
Give me another name
Right?
That sort of "coincidence" is the kind that jumps off the page and says "Hi there, I'm a giant red flag, how ya doin'?"

Therefore sad is a good thing?
/me now has a HoodyNinja hat
HoodyNinja: Well, in some cases it can be.
We must know sadness in order to understand true happiness.
Well books never end. They are a world than can be revisited time and time again
Yeah, but its not the same once I finish it
Like games
Some are replayable, some aren't, but after I beat it, its never the same

SirGanjalf: Sorry, I'm listening to my own song, do ya know it or should load the stream?

Oh this.

Caramelldansen xD
Oh my, why am I smiling?... wait... nooo... I like it

*forget
I think I might be able to, I can work and fall asleep to dubstep, techno and the like.
Two things Allegr0: 1)Really, what was the name of the last piece again? and 2) What's your GW2 characer names? Mine are Human Saber Zx and Asuran Carabosa.

Human Saber Zx.
Wat.
^
Okay! :)
XD

/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
sorta disappointing... but eh
did I reveal myself?
Pondoo pls.
btw: about that Rarity partying hard gif - i need similar with Twilight(you know what scene i'm talking about)
you dont need twi
rarity is all you need
^sometimes you just need a little more pony
MOAR PONAY.
ryaxnbasus, ipv6 bro's /)
Eww, ponies are for little girls
AdamTheDuck, so are ducks
Ironic how you're one Adam.
:>
I always thought he was a duck.
But flesh eating ducks are awesome D:
SirGanjalf: you want link?
Na he's a little girl.
twilight_sprinkle: yes, please
Allegr0, any recomendations for headphones?
Yeah i should but Ive got a bunch of cleaning up to do in the house :/
Am thinking of putting it off until tomorrow
Phase4 honestly, I don't...haven't looked at portable hardware in a really long time :/
omg u mst get dem 1337 dr dra beatz
ALEGRO?
dey r so kool
/me glomps Allegr0
Now my keyboard is screaming in silence.
Phase4 been thinking the same thing lately...there's one type of boze phones that are supposed to be really good
Heh, SirGanjalf, want a song you WILL NOT be able to fall asleep to/
?
/me gives Jmo's keyboard a voice
maybe...

Boze?
BOZE?
BOSE.
sorry, bose*
Booze?
whoops
AdamTheDuck: meat eating duck are awsomeeeeeeeee
Booze headphones
i like this idea
What have you created.
:D
Phase4: Depends on your budget. I just spent 300 on my Bose noise Cancelling Headphones.
I recommend them. :)
Allegr0 ^^ i didnt change mah nick. How are you?
Sabershy, thats the other issue, don't really want noise cancelling
aw, i thought someone said booze:(
Phase4 it depend on what you are looking for and rthe budget
but it seems all the higher end ones have it
say my budget is $500 (achivable right now), whats in that range
...
thats quite a bit
o.0
i like music
Phase4 check this like over at lifehacker http://lifehacker.com/5800772/
May I have permission to post an audio link?
For SirGanjalf.
Phase4: I see. Well,either way, Bose is usually universaly accpeted to produce the best speakers/headphones so if you are going for somthing, go for them.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=321005657007
Maan for $500 I'd rather buy a sound system, you trippin' bra.
Not sure what to say about that
donutpop365: You could PM him it. :)
donutpop365: just pm me
XD
Oh oky right.
donutpop365: In these cases PM him
Jmo, already got a good sound system
Phase4 I spent 200 on a pair of v-moda lp2 and couldn't be happier with the quality
Orly?

twilight_sprinkle: That's a slightly Japanese pun, you know.
donutpop365: yus
twilight_sprinkle: Niiiiceee!
Kencolt: what is?
eddmario cheew out and eat out mean two different things... one you would do to your girl friend the other you would do to a college that fails to pull his weight in a group project.
donutpop365: i wasnt the one who thought of it, many people use it :P
Telling Pando to go to bread. It's kind of complicated.
"/)
Kencolt knows me???
Rawr, keeps on trying to recognize as a command.
Panda: Yeah, eat out is the college roommate one, and chew out is the chick thing. Or are they the other way around?
Panda: No, but I do know some Japanese and Japanses culture and brand names.
otherway
eddmario^
Panda: Ah.
eddmario ^^ now that that is settled, im off
What do you call a Holocaust victim from Paris?

Wait, do they STILL make episodes of this?
00,10and the sun's a mass of incandasent gas

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
best stream ever
Aren't ice skates just modified shoes?
Um, I'm pretty sure most people call them Jetskis...
00,10waverunners
sea du is a brand name. >.>
Ugh... Soooooo.... Sleeeeeepyyy...
00,10so is jello
11,02The sun's mass is less than or equal to the mass of the original Xbox
liek their 'jello' episode they alwase said gellitain
Alrighty everypony, I'm gonna hit the hay, it's 2:30 In the mornin' here, g'night everypony!
/me Snore
night donutpop365
11,02Night donutpop365 :)
00,10they probably had to say sea doo
night donutpop365
11,02I'm going to bed too :3
00,10inorder to get to toor the factory
A Jetski and a Seadoo are two different brands. The Jetski is, IIRC, built somewhat differently-- and ridden more skilike, where the Seadoo is less so. But I may well be mistaken.
11,02Night all :)
meh it's understandable
/me High fives NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
night twilight_sprinkle, NewSuperBronyU, taoumi.
nightu NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
00,10there are not many companys that make jetski's and such
night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
Ciao, and goodnight. :)
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: sleep weel my love =D
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: wait
that's true Sumica
and it's not a genaric item like aluminium or corn flakes
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
00,10that's rather hitech
lets not ever watch the 'jello' episode
I just checked. Letski's usually don't have much in the way of a seat-- you're standing on them. A Seadoo has more of a seatlike configuration-- the Motorcycle analogy.
00,10yeah but see doo is a brand
00,10wave runner is the type of craft
00,10would not think IR could make out text
why not. it's jsut a flashlight
if its black on white it probably isnt hard
taoumi: lol no
00,10and now you see why wine cost so damn much
twilight_sprinkle: actualy it usualy is. jsut o na fequency that is not visable
taoumi: thats a lot more complex than a flash light though
taoumi: if it were just a flashlight, it could easily show colors
most night vision is heavily dependent on a light source and a reciver. twilight_sprinkle . and i use flash light i nthe most vauge of terms. nto spesificaly a tube that emits the visable light spectrum
taoumi: i know that, im saying that making it make text visible isnt easy
why wouldn't it be?
taoumi: well im not entirely sure of the specifics of the programming of the night vision, but it cant even show color
And most corks these days are plastic. Oh, that was so darn simplified it was almost painful.
color has nothign to do with reflecting the brightness of soemthing twilight_sprinkle
hey everybody I'm back :)
Internet went down
morning!
Money Success Fame Bronies
taoumi: brightness isnt whats being reflected, its specific waelengths
00,10hi ShyBetaFemale and The_Engineer
wb The_Engineer and ShyBetaFemale
i liek synthetiv corks Kencolt they work alot better then natual corks
So, Shy, when's the release date? I mean, your being still in Beta and all...
masterboards
not allowed to say Kencolt :P
what are you talking about twilight_sprinkle. color has to do w/ wave lenght. brightness is volume of photons
yay~
you know what. i'm doen wit hthis i wash my hands
how its made
dat edging machine
00,10take wood, grind it up to make wood...........
/me washes hands
Sumica, ikr
taoumi: I have found certain differences between the flavors of the various types of corks. Also, natural cork actually tends to give a better seal, due to it's swelling, but it's expensive these days, so you usually only find it on the higher end products.
taoumi: yes, and its based not on the volume that is being received, but the wavelengths that have been received back, like a radar afaik
Sumica, though partical board and mdf are often made of scrap so its generally ok
00,10true
00,10oh god it's ikea wood
Sumica: More take scraps and grind it up to make something that you can bld with. I'm okay with that, it's "green".
mdf is a fun material, wod powder + glue
wood'
mica wtf did i draw
aaa Kencolt but natual cork has a tendncy to rot if left alone too long. synthetic dosen't have that problem... but it is true it dosen't seal so well i nthe sort term
and it can make a funky tast if it gets sugar in it :/
taoumi: Not in wine-- there are bottles hundreds of years old that are still intact. The cork reacts to the wine. Storage also plays a lot into it.
<< aparently its insanely dificult to do this work with machines
not alwase true Kencolt. whiel some are stil lgood... others are jsut vinigar :/. nto sure if it's a mater of the cork or the bottleing.
Trust me- my father was a wine maniac. When I was a kid, his idea of lunch was fruit and cheese and a nice wine. And I was a 16 year old who sometimes joined him... with, admittedly, a much cmaller glass. Dad Didn't France, but he highly approved of their eating habits.
wine? glass bottle sealed with epoxy, that should hold it
And it's more the bottling.
lol your dad didn't france
UNtil comparative recently (historically speaking) glass bottles were uneven and non-standardised, so bottles could be... wonky. Seals were uncertain if the glassblower was less than skilled.
the french drink soooo much..
guys
what are you doing for halloween
when i was in France, we were staying at family friends, so the house owners wife got so drunk, she woke me up in the middle of the night with a shotgun to go shoot invisible people
so do the itilians
but the wine is reaaaaaaaly weak
taoumi: Well, not all wines-- but it's true that beaujolais isn't that much stronger than soda.
suddenly pony

00,10super is the nintendo person
Hello all
00,10hi Rommulus
by Nintendo person you mean Nintendo fanboy, right sumica?
:)
And I doubt even HE has a C-64. (I had a c-128 when I waqs a kid, but that was so long ago... my first real computer system. Comp, diskdrive, monitor, even a printer... I was the tech geek of the block. I even had a modem. (Although noting existed but dial-up local message boards back then.)
yep, Ingram and Anderson are still great.
00,10he's speaking of emulaters Kencolt
poor tutles :'(
Sumica: Ah. I'm not. ^_^
00,10but you would be right, my first computer was a 386
00,10still useing the same case
00,10and yes Alchemist, tis why I love the voice off eps
386 and 486
00,10even when it's not big musical eps like this the bgm is still great
It certainly shows how much of the fullmusical number is carried by the singing as well.
00,10yep
hey Sumica wher did u get yr name from
00,10Armored core
cool
whats armored core
00,10A play station game
oh awsome
Ohh, I saw a LP about it on YT, seemed like an interesting game.
00,10if i ever got a PS3 it would be for that game
00,10Rarity loved that part I am sure
you really dont need to do all of this just for a pet
just found this http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8184/
hey Sumica i have an antie who is british and talks like rarity
Make others compete for love. Totally morally acceptable :D
00,10lol
00,10nice they they made there own score for this rather then just copy pasta
I forget, whats the name of this song?
00,10flight of the valcurys
00,10only spelled the right way
ah yes thanks
Wouldnt they have to own the rights if they copypasted it?
awwww shieettt viking helmets with battle axe and all that good stuff
Hey you guys mind if i post a couple of links? They arent youtube.
00,10I think it's an old enough song that it's free and clear
00,10abbalanch
lots of songs are pretty much public domain at this point
Publical domain, yeah
00,10kinda like the whilham scream
I just checekd out EQD's nightly round up. I learned something very important. Turkey should NOT be allowed to adapt MLP:FiM under ANY circumstances. BUt they already did...
00,10tank has a theme, go figure
But beware, if you get 10-20 mp3 illegally and get caught you will be fines for millions of dollars.
00,10oh more bad dubing to stream Kencolt?
00,10Twi has 3 pets
Sumica: Not merely that. Turkey apparenly has some amazing cencorship laws. How else do you explain five episodes being BANNED?
00,10lolwut?
Where did she get those bandages?
00,10tank had them clearly
Tank carried the bandages in his trunk.
Oh tank, so caring
00,10so why cant dash have 2 if twi has 3
You have won, but Im gonna award the guy arriving last anyways. morally totally acceptable again :D
Sumica: twi has 3 how so
Sumica: Twilight has one pet. Spike has a pet phoenix. Spike is not a pet, he's a little brother and assistant.
00,10owl, spike and pipsqueeke
Sumica: Pipsqueak is a PONY from Trottingham. You mean PeeWee.
Sumica: im going to go and agree with Kencolt here sorry

Hayo Dat_Octavia.
why doesnt the bronystate staff just have a 24/7 minecraft server?
Although, were this person to do a full JP dub... it would work.
Hi Dat_Octavia
Hello Dat_Octavia :D
13DeadpoolDash|GW2: cause minecraft is a hog, and none of us have the inclination to pay for a server
00,10so you meen this Kencolt?
and arabic?
13if/when we host we do it off our own boxen, which is a drain on resources
Hello Shizuka :$
Most of the people here dont know me. It was a time... long long ago, when Bronystate was still young... *flashback!*
or turkish?
does it eat bandwidth?
13depending on how many people are on
00,10memory more then bandwith
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7670/
13get over 3 people and the memory requirement shoots up
need a seperate server box then
13plus CPU for keeping up with chunk updates
00,10did they skip a bit/
Sumica: No. Check out EQD and the Nightly Roundup-- it's in there. And prepare to be horrified. I mean amazed. Yeah,. that's the ticket.
Ever since I started using that site to link to pics on EqD, ppl have been using it a lot more...
thegt90: the singing isnt bad imo
13anyway.. crash time..
Dat_Octavia: Well, welcome back! Hope you still enjoy yourself :)

French Discord is awesome
that sounded evil
My favorite is Wonderscrews
But in the Danish version-- FRENCH DISCORD?
I think the french and german dubs are really great based on what I saw.
Still have to hear Italian Chrysalis and Discord
I see where they made the translation error, and it's really funny. XD
But Discord is BATMAN
I want to hear Italian ponies as well
Wow, pretty good!
French soots him well
So German Discord would be nice
French voices does great villains

Sumica: yes it is
00,10they added effects?

This is pretty good too :$
00,10they defentaly did a good job
00,10it's no JDL
00,10but still good
They got Discord down
Wouldn't it be awesome if Discord came back and got his own song?
Sumica: that's the guys who dubbed Batman Beyond Bruce Wayne
I cant see discord singing.
00,10discording singing?
I doubt Discord is coming back >_>
00,10can do
Neither do I, cuz I can't imagine John DeLancey singing. XD
discord really shouldn't come back
I can see Discord singning an Opera
Ya Discord semms more Opera
only if its a Spanish song
That'd kick ass
well the bronycon doco has a song by mic which has him singing
XylemTube: except if it was like, for a distant past episode
An opera of chaos
is this what I think it is?
Yaaaaaay
oh no

Luna is so adorable
Both princesses are adorable

OH GAWD FRENCH <3
honey to my ears
Celestias voice seems to soft
I kinda want to hear Russian
like wiping my ass with silk
Rommulus: This one's better?
lol Princess? Not Principessa?
Not better sadly
french is so much softer
Gold_Demona: IKR
No Klingon version?
I demand a Klingon dub of this series
Hnnngggghhhh~
A Klingon dub would be GLORIOUS!!!
Some pony must make a Klingon dub
I want a Brititsh dub
Gold_Demona: Her name is licensed as Princess Celestia. And Princess Luna. And as we have seen, atempts to "translate" names seem to suffer horribly...
You know everyone has British accents
00,10it's funny how many difrent ways they have pinking make a fall sound
Gold_Demona: I can't wait to see if they reuse the Nightmare Moon voice for Bigluna :D
Kencolt: So Princess is her NAME and not her TITLE?
No way in hell a Klingon version hasn't been done yet. To the youtubes
Gold_Demona: in the italian dub
Gold_Demona: It's her title-- IN EQUESTRIA.
00,10she sound evil
Other Spanish dub
lol
Has more of an almighty feel to it
Celestia sounds Russian
I like Luna
inb4 Esperanto dub
In that one
Luna is best pony
Luna is best pony indeed
00,10I miss s1 luna

Luna is growing up

Fyi guys, new italian pony episodes at saturday, 10 am :D
time for polish link spam http://youtu.be/RYO2I4b7vv0 http://youtu.be/clm3GjqncJs http://youtu.be/zlVRN-qePmA http://youtu.be/xMfEPM0ZBQ4 http://youtu.be/EEus29ETpPY http://youtu.be/_Uud_5Moldk
Hey MadSurge, do you guys still get new dubbed Lupin specials over there?
Her shadow could have been done better though
Oppa Klingon Style http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CayMeza487M >.>
Gold_Demona: to be honest I never saw Lupin specials, and the series pops out occasionally
So no I guess
Last I checked the most recent Italian dubbed Lupin special was Green vs Red. Figured I'd ask. :P
Luna's eyes are a few shades too light of a cyan
I saw a DVD of that while browsing stuff on a mall :D
I like to collect the italian dubbed Lupin cuz I like watching it when I can kind of quasi understand half of every other sentence. lol
Gold_Demona: :D
Kinda how I started enjoying english and spanish comedy
From what little I do know of Italian outside of what sounds like Spanish. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY7AK4k3Idk
Gold_Demona: just fill in the gaps with what you know :D
All the Spanish I speak is with my family
Espanol~
Yesh Español
Si senorita.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with some large trout
Señora. I'm married. :P
PFFFFFFT
Sañorita is "miss"
Don't you try playing me with your fancy language.
Señorita*
:D
XD
Gold_Demona: kinda funny hearing people not being able to pronounce senorita right, huh? :D
MadSurge: IKR? :D
MadSurge: Hearing them try to pronounce ANY Spanish words is pretty funny. :D
Yesh, same for italian with any word with the GN sound :D
http://youtu.be/VurPtgu874g
If I remember right, the GN in Italian is the same as the Ñ in Spanish.
Correct!
Like how "lasagna" is pronounced "lasaña"
"lasanya"
Hey all
Yep
Hello Socks
I love lasagna. :$
Ohai Socks
http://youtu.be/obdLhRTfDFo
/me hugs Gold_Demona and AdamTheDuck
Gold_Demona: delicious and filling!
http://youtu.be/hjfJXi7S18Y
Hehe CrimsonPhoenix, that's my screen saver :P
MadSurge: My husband and I often jokingly pronounce it "la ZAG nuh"
AdamTheDuck, as well as I
Gold_Demona: :D
I have a couple language programs of Italian lying around. I just haven't gotten around to playing with them. :D
Been distracted. XD
By ponies. And pokémon. And Star Wars. And Assassins.
:D
http://youtu.be/bp6YZ4Go3Cc
>_>
Curse your distractions.
http://youtu.be/3Ffu0h2vrzk
Jmo: LOL, yeah Dema still has to kick those Plasmas' asses. XD
;__;
Gold_Demona: still on the first Assassin's Creed?
MadSurge: Yesh
Each day goes by I refresh my DA in hope of seeing a new comic.
Gold_Demona: just wait until you see virtual Italy in AC2 :$
MadSurge: I'll get through it eventually. Keep being distracted by other games. :D
The pain.
MadSurge: Is it anything like the real one?
/me curls up and cries
/me pats Jmo :<
http://youtu.be/zN46qd5aOqE
Poor Jmo. :<
Don't worry. I'll get back to it someday. I always do. :P
AC2 is really good
Gold_Demona: not just anything like it, it's pretty much faithful to the ancient city plans!
I managed to finish it in a day :P
MadSurge: Ooh, that's awesome. =D
Good morning everypony :3
Good morning Ponies47
Dat lower pitched version http://youtu.be/GYTNY8qqFe4
Gold_Demona: you can totally recognize some of the roads if you've visited the cities in the game
Socks: I'm currently playing through the series for the first time. Still on the first one. :D
good morning Ponies47 :)
MadSurge: That will probably make me want to visit Italy even more than I already do. :D
Hai Ponies47
Gold_Demona: The only one I've played is 2, still a really good game, currently doing a peaceful run of it.
Gold_Demona: should resume playing it, but I can't stay on PS3 and PC at the same time. Parents :P
heh
MadSurge: I have all PC version. Steam sales are my bane. :P
Gold_Demona: they don't really mind me playing the 3DS and PC at the same time though :D
You're a good artist Ponies47, do you take special commissons?
Gold_Demona: I have an old laptop, definitely can't run those games on this :|
heh
DAMN YOU STEAM SALES.
Ohai DerpyMuffins and Ponies47!
My wallet weeps with sorrow.
Why thanks DerpyMuffins, I don't take them really at the moment
We know that feel Jmo... We know it oh too well...
But you don't know it like me ;__;
Steam sales are good for me to get some games I'll play once I have a better computer :D
DerpyMuffins: I'm not an artist but I can have a go :P
Luckily my list doesn't grow as much as it use to.
Ask Dema, she knows how many games I have.
Jmo, .-.
Oh well, tell me when you do Ponies47
Hate you Gabe.
I bought the whole Assassin's Creed series during Steam's summer sale because they had all four games in a bundle for 30 bucks. o_o
Thank heavens for the Steam Cloud
DerpyMuffins: Sure. I'm still practicing and such but I am gettting better :3
38.78 I believe
I don't like steam cloud. It screws up my Plants vs Zombies when I switch between playing on my PC and my Mac.
Oi
Steam Cloud is good :<
It makes my PvZ unable to load! T^T
Gold_Demona: I didn't plan on getting a Mac anyway, they're too costly
WELL
ID UNNO
If not for that, I'd use it in a heartbeat
Without thinking even
Can see the flaw in it >_>
Gold_Demona, turn off Steam cloud for PvZ then, that might do the trick
MadSurge: I tell you what though. It's obvious Assassin's Creed was made as a console game. The PC controls are TERRIBLE. It made me glad I had an XBox controller lying around.
AdamTheDuck: I did. ANd it did. :P
Genesis*
For some reason I have the sudden urge to hurt Adam.
Why so mean Jmo? :<
>The Hub plays all 13 episodes on S3 with no breaks and S3 ends in January.
Cuz I can.
:>
Jmo: Is it because he stole your trout earlier? Or is it because you wub him?
Neither.
/me runs over to AdamTheDuck, licks him and runs
>_>
<_<
/me stabs Jmo with a rusty kitchen knife .-.
o_o
Rusty? that could cause an infection.
\:3/
AdamTheDuck... In the chat room... With a rusty kitchen knife...
Did I win?
The Game.
I wni.
http://fav.me/d5isage
win.
/me dances
Gold_Demona: I got a simile-pse controller just in case the game requires better controlling/to override the key limit :D
HOW MANY POINTS DO I RECEIVE!!! 8D
Adam is now crying.
ah, Tetanus infection. good times
Oh noes
:'(
I are crying nao
Cry cry
wat.
She wants socks to be sexy ponay.
MadSurge: I got an actual XBOX 360 controller that's meant for use on an XBOX 360. :P
Only theory I have of that picture.
/me shrugs
What!
Not you fool.
Good afternoon guys.
MadSurge: And I got it specifically for my PC. Figure that one out. :D
Hello Malavolent
Hiyo Malavolent
Afternoon, evening, morning.

/me rolls out
MadSurge: I need it inside me.
WTF^

Vordox: What's Crossover? Is that like Wine?
Gold_Demona: A program that makes Mac able to read exe files
Ah
READ ALL EXE FILES.
I have a Mac, but I do not have that
Also, look at this :D http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ar0D8sfeMP0/UIeZ3ELnYLI/AAAAAAAATG8/mqrMrywokpM/s1600/i68.jpg IDW is crossing franchises! :D

I should go see if Black 2 is in the mail. (doesn't)
My brony friend at school always introduces me to his friends as "My brony friend" which turns them off, I'm losing a lot of potential freinds because of it :(
Which is fun!
Friends are over-rated.
Quotes from Luna herself
I'd rather find that out once I have a lot of them.
/me needs MLP wool sweaters
DerpyMuffins: :D
Believe there can be a thing as too much friends
All I need is my ponies.
MLP necktie and cufflinks
My parents are loaded, so everyone wants to be my friend
People don't seem to give a flying feather really about me liking ponies. I've evene watched ponies infront of them to
Jmo, hah ponies are gaaaaaaaay
*even
Just because of my money
ikr
Ima so gay.

*shakes his fist* YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, SPIDER-MAN!
Hey everypony I have a question
Hmmmmmmmmmmm?
Should I get a Electric Violin or stick with acoustic?
Rommulus, acoustic <3
i like acoustic more :)
Get a triangle.
They're hardcore.
Almost as hardcore as cowbells
^
i have an acoustic guitar that i cant live with out it :)
Anyone ever try playing an electric triangle before?
nope
How about an electric cowbell?
that would be hardcore ^
Yes they would
^
I would XD
only if its on sale
DerpyMuffins: You'd be amazed the sorts of stupid products we buy.
I'm a sucker for kitchen gadgets

Luckily for me, she likes me for me, and not my money
Hey, Bronystate!

Tovler: Shame I haven't been properly trolled before.
Wow, all of ohGr's, Skinny Puppy's, and Ministry's songs added another 500 songs to my playlist
Tovler: trolls don't like people not getting angry at their insults :$

MadSurge: The trool who isn't getting angry at him is not a troll
*getting people
Unlike when I posted a picture that had applebloom, bondage, watersports, and scat in here and got banned

Hey :)
Hoy!
Good morning, Good afternoon, or Good evening!
Take your pick, any or all
I always get lazy doing paperwork for the office - should have just skipped it and left for the jobsite this morning - I don't want to get out of this chair :(
good night for me :D
mostly because I have a motorized packer with my name on it waiting for me - We're putting in underground pvc and today we're covering a finished trench - packing the dirt solid so the ground wont sink with the foundation is laid
a few more creepy pics should chase me away :)
what size is it? like... push size, sit-on size, or vehicle sized?
feels like something I should know and I've seen... just can't recall
and apologies, I don't keep a creepy pic library
I posted a good one earlier :) and NOPE! I wont repost that one for awhile
/me shrugs
:O I know the perfect site for creepy stuff :)
hello guys :)
happy morning time!
:( it doesnt exist anymore
used to have a huge archive of ghost pictures people sent in over many years - were thousands of them but havent checked the site in a few years - forgot about it
There's a Pinball of the Dead game! :D
almost 2 hours late and I still cant find the will to get out of my chair - looks like Im working til 5:30 today :)
eww... working late
GET OUT
OUT WITH YOU
Overtime! - but they're making us work saturdays too - I hope it rains tomorrow :|
cant work in a mud pit :)
Hi! Whats up guys?

Has anypony seen the new TFS movie? Its Revenge of Cooler abridged and by the mods its hilarious!
poop, I killed it
nah, it's pretty dead
and I can't say I've seen it
Seems like it
I generally don't go looking for things to burn time on... most of the time...
There are so many 1 liners in it its not even funny, but it still is cuz its funny. If that made any sense to you you win a derpy.
Idunno one liners are funny cause it's meant as a quick laugh?
eh, timing matters
timing and context
^
want a taste or no spoilers?
No spoilers :(
k then, you should watch it tho
Hey guys

Holy freaking CRAP!
/me 's computer begins to smoke
I was about to ask why you'd need a picture that finite, but THAT'S a pretty good reason
Not finite...
That's not the right word...
big?
I was looking for a more specific descriptor than that, but I guess that works
Infinite?
:P
gtg cya
No, not infinite
Macro?
There's not a computer big enough to hold "infinite" :P
can i watch new season here?
Gold_Demona: ...yet

pony_8620 until than we are naot allowed to talk about Season 3 here, or you will get a Perma Ban
:P

I suppose the wording I was looking for was "I was about to ask why you'd NEED 9 Gigapixels, but that's a pretty good reason"
querk want to be saved by link
/me starts downloading 8 gigapixel picture... "8 days left"
:D
Aw man, I cant wait to watch season 3! (random bystander) Yes you can.:| Yeah, I guess your right.

GEMA*
NullRadix: did u finish cooler abridged?
Indeed! I found it quite enjoyable.
I just then jumped back into my programming

I'm a programmer. As part of being a programmer, you often become at least partially computer savvy
But no, I do not specifically study or know how to fix your computer
/me coughs
I see, then I have a technical question that does not include my computer
/me eyes DoctoDoctorWho suspiciously
go on...?
hai everypony :3
g'morning Spell-of-Gaming
I'm just sitting here, waiting for all of the Minecraft mods to update to 1.4.2
Do you know how to remove a voice from a video? In the sense that singers A B & C made a music video, I want to remove Singer A's voice. How would I do this?
as far as an actual answer... it may or may not be possible depending on the music format (I think)
It's possible if Singers B and C are in the back.
/me join stupidsexytwilight
FUCK
LOL
i need to learn slashes
I would imagine... in the BEST possible scenario for that... the data for each singer is stored separately
xmasmare|Almond: You're not very good at joining channels
more likely, it's all stored in one stream of data, and while you may be able to use audio programs to pull that person's voice out, it would effect the rest of the track
Also, we found one secret
Personally, I'm going to assume xmasmare|Almond's blunder was in fact, NOT a blunder... and in fact... A TRAP!
We can view a person's joined channels with /whois, anyway.
Well, that is the second time you've done it though. :P
Ohai
/me is now just going to quit bronystate as a whole
Is there a stream going on?
Nope
why quit when we have the master of kicking right here?
excuse me, banning.
:I
Im attempting to edit a youtube vid for a local talent show, I remove the lead singers voice and sing in his place.
just saw the new Trailer for the New Paper Mario Game... I was confusaed during the Goat Part... I still am
I'm glad they're going back for the Turn-based RPG
Super Paper Mario's real-time battle sucked.
I like the filler for it, though.
I'm not gonna play it, I don't have a 3DS, but I still like it :) even bought the N64 one with the Package last year
Reggie is such a weird speaker xD
Anyone having graphics issues with Minecraft 1.4.2?
"Spin trhe System to control a Buddle of water named Eddie, through the Level
"A Puddle of Water named Eddie"... I think that killed me

DoctoDoctorWho: of course it's dabi

I am not familiar with many mods voices, sorry
Shizuka: :D dem confused/disgusted faces
FOCUS!!!!!
DoctoDoctorWho: now you know. :D
13it's their reaction to seeing something open up massive
WAIT WUT
yay 11th hour
the... te phuq?
:D
God dammit Shizuka, someone always pulls that out when I think everyone has forgotten about it. XD
Dear Dari: I'm not sure I can properly build the same level of hate for this character if I'm forced to watch this at 2.5x speed. Perhaps you could slow it down to properly spread the hate?
Eugh
Of course.
Not as though I have anything bad to say about Matt Smith's Doctor anyway.
13not at all
Or this...New intro...
I... I cant watch this.
Dari, why is your favourite doctor on the stream?
DashWithRainbows: You weren't there for regs truth or dare, were you?
I chose dare.
Dari in regs skype?
... NOW we see Doctor who? now that I wanted to do something productive for 1 hour or more -.-
Yeah
Yeah... I left that chat ages ago
Ill be back later
>praying to Santa
Lil_B: it's Matt Smith! RUN
ADISOGJARIGKAIOK...NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
we should watch some sixth doctor
NOTHING AT ALL
All is good...
MadSurge I don't know who he is
Lil_B: the non-existing 11th doctor
yes prey to santa not jesus.....
^
MadSurge: ... ok
13http://i.imgur.com/gEXk0.gif < dari right now
arent santa and jesus the same guy?
because Santa olways sents Blue Plicxe Boxes
Shizuka: AHAHAHA, that captures it perfectly.
Shizuka: :D well played
doctor_whooves127: they certainly are equally real :D
Out of the two I believe more in Santa
some1 just came from sweet apple arcres....
what was that?
Que's que fu...?
?Que?
haha...
¿Que?***
yo
sorry, Qu'est-ce que... I think...
an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Me no speako spicy
... even as a Kid I wouöld start not trusting this guy
yum
what an ass...
you know what? eat sunlight and drink air.
Yeah... is there a point to this sequence?
it was for fun
so this doctor needs to be fat i gess?
Hey
hi
Dudum
did he just... one-line "wobbly wobbly timey wimey"?
you know... I like this... I should go watch Dr Who
yes
Yes, he used one of my favourite Tennant lines.
Not that that's a problem...
huh. kay
that makes TOTAL sense
the fifth doctor used it
... hound of tendalos?
the closter bell
oh hey, doc time ^^

DDocter who?

lololol
time to go back in time...
good thing he can go back in time...
Now, I don't know much about the Doctor... but in my limited experience his Time Machine is not... reliably guidable
Oh god really
Dabi, are you streaming?
...
Take that as a no.
I wish I weren't.
dari
or at least, whenever it *is* guidable something goes wrong
Oh.
Dabi streaming S5E01. Wat.
Who r u ;_;
Regs were playing truth or dare
And I chose dare
>_>
<_<
Faaaak
that blood?
Looks more like jam
Alien saliva more like it.
bummer
Only 1 episode dabi?
Yeah
And I'm not allowed to say anything bad about the episode
lolk
Ahahaha
... only during? or does that count for after as well?
You guys are dicks.
During
i like how worked at locking the door but not unlocking the cuffs
Hi guys :)

Oh I remember this episode now :D
OH! I get it!
ROOOAAAAARRRRR
Fish fingers and custard.
What the heck are we watching

LOl

sonicdude558|school: Later.

or break his legs
wow thats getting annoying
ahh...
Ohey everyone :)
Colt_Brovakiin: Sup.
has it been more than 12 years?
So wait which person actually said for him to stream this episode?
Didn't specify which episode
I think the Grandma there was the little Girls, buzt thats just guessing
5 bucks says Meanwhile
And otakon chose the dare
Oh his life is gonna get alot harder.
Hell no, Meanwhile would have done something much, much, worse.
Holla everypony! :)
like what dari :S
Hayo GilDash
Heya GilDash :)
hai GilDash
GilDash: Sup.
He has something horrible planned for if someone ever chooses dare when it's his choice
Mihaui GilDash
God only knows
Ahahaha
mihau*
who are they?
Invi this time... not tha BORG
worst cops ever heck the jadu are better cops
Invi: jackasses that want the monster of the week imprisoned
Sudden heart attack?
has the Doctor Heart Problems?
He's got three hearts anyway
Dari Suddenly I feel really glad I left that group. Knowing Connor, he'd probably want me to do something that involves spiders.
You left?
Ohai ashie-poo
wat
Yeah.
When?
this is...different
Is there a spider hanging above your head ashie-poo?
:>
umm ok...
Dari on the 19th.
Why?
take off the tie....
^
The redhead is really cute
taking off the tie may not be that easy
I wanted to change a lot of stuff in my life, got bored with that group seeing that I barely said anything in the chat and soon I just felt like leaving.
I want to believe... wrong show
if she did it right, both ends of the tie are stuck in that car
now kiss
now do this: http://cheezburger.com/6581616896
DashWithRainbows: but you're here with us :)
you could still losen it and slide it off
NullRadix: You can loosen the noose around your neck and slip out easily.
I was here to begin with, MadSurge, I was just lurking a lot
like I still do.
sexay lurker ;D
I'm back.
Welcome back VenHur
So, i'm guessting this is the first apperance of the 10th Doctor?
Also seems kinda weird he can carry a sonic screwdriver but he can't carry a pocket knife..
Bingo
this looks strange xD
DashWithRainbows: why 'Toast'?
DashWithRainbows: I lurk too, but at least I manage to talk with people often in this chat
oh? whats the occasion?
NOOOOOooo
oh, NOW the time is actually counting down
SpeccyRush, because I ate toast a lot in the middle of classes, my GT on XBL was toast related at the time so my friends just went with that as my nickname.
I like all the people in this chat :D
Besides, I really dislike the name "Ashley"
Dat Product Placement
"Ash" isn't that bad though.
But it's so good ashie-poo.
:3
porn
that pink room...
-lol
DashWithRainbows: suddenly in a sharing mood eh :S
You asked, I answered.
dabi what'd you do to him?
but his Desktop was oddly non-cluddered
Besides, I'm in a somewhat good mood since I found out I'm doing well in college via review session.
Ahahaha chav doing good in school.
IKR?
That's a good one.
DashWithRainbows: I did, but you're the one that mentioned Ashley, instead of say Ash
where does the doctor come from?
Gallifrey
Damn you dabi
send the Varus Vide Radio xD
brb
Meh, still part of the story, Speccy. If I liked my name, I wouldn't have wanted the nickname.
Virus*
Ash just doesn't want people to bother him for autographs when he's trying to complete his quest to become a pokemon master
"Let's do this" great inspirtational
he those ponies.
he saw*
egahd pokemans
DashWithRainbows: fair enough
Do you want a hug DWR?

Not sure where you heard that
How the hell is Doctor Who educational?
well its the longest show ever
dammit BUFFER

>Dem 90's clothes
Meanwhile, in the nineties...
oh, thought you ment the actual topic on the channel >.>

"Have you ever been teased? Well take a look at this next one." Quite the transition.

The '90's sucked
Dashie_Dashie, I'll bet this was made in the 90's
she wonders about geting teased with that hat?
ok who do we have here thats new and has never seen dari stream?

Kandarihu: Ya don't say?

MadSurge: I just find them funnyier to watch :P

Yaay
UK curry as opposed to US curry...
0612:'D
The Dudesons are way more insane
08,01UK curry is kinda rubbish
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na Sonny!
o.o?
3How the- o.o
and noone ever dies
08,01most UK food is, tbh
a little bit
Dudesons are the definition of "YOLO"
Colt_Brovakiin: do they do less shit that involve piss and assholes? :D
the human body amazes me
08,01but there are some exceptions
08,01Kurra: if you're ever in Edinburgh, go to the Mosque Kitchen
<3
08,01they do really good curries
I think I would like curry, except that maybe it all tastes... it just burns, even the non-spicy stuff.
okie :>
MadSurge: Yep :P and they hurt themselfs alot more :D
these are just guys that continuosly prove they have god mode cheats
wut r u doing
08,01Kurra: i'm kinda immune to chilli
Stahp.

Kurra: What are you talking about?
/me 08,01grew up with lots of indian food
Colt_Brovakiin: well, I can endure light wounds. :S
You can get really mild curries that aren't spicy at all
*:D
Yeah!
And those are spicy even.

Runrunrunrunrunrun
08,01korma's not too spicy
Except they aren't
VERY FEW are not spicy.

gogogogogogogog

AHAHAHA
:D

:D
MadSurge: :P
08,01obviously, it depends on how it's made
LOL
08,01and everyone feels chilli differently
This guy is my hero
XD
Yes, but if they don't have anything like chilis in
no chance
Which a lot of curries don't
Then how can you still call them spicy?
GOTTA RUN FAST.
the one who will tell me what animal is in the following chars will get a cookie: 
because they are spicy to me D:
they burn.
...
why is this hilarious
There are tons that don't
I wear stetsons.
if you see only squares, you won't get any :D
I dunno what is in them, but apart from the spice thye tasty....

Fuken chiken nuggets

Dashie_Dashie: maybe Nittany_Discord will watch its movements :D
Currywurst ^^

O.o\
I thought UK foods were like Indian. 'cuz you know, it'd be cool to try somthing awesome that people go to little holes in the wall for, little places that make great foods...
dat time
Invi: hah :D... wait im east coast
what is it now?
Invi: yep
he may look good but what about the guy who was filming it?
keyboards
Dashie_Dashie: wait what!?
Yay :) you're right
08,01Kurra: UK food basically consists of taking something and boiling it without salt
The guy filming it was using tons of safety equipment, you can bet on that.
5You are all part of my plan.
I love russell howard :3
Yay, this program! :D
Eli, well it's actually just the spice we call curry that we put in ^^
Dashie_Dashie: Fuck, fuck fucity fuck. Welp!
08,01Kurra: roasts
08,01that's all this country can do well
.__.
08,01and sausages
I know there are and I'm forgetting what they are
anyway
Invi: it doesn't taste bad, just not like curry should to me
0614It's an evil plan
08,01and even then, we don't do sausages as good as Germany
5Renji_Abarai..you have been part of my plan from the beginning..
/me changed the topic of channel again :)
@_@ am I the only one who don't know who is who?
/me wins :)
Eh, I prefer normal sausages to bratwursts
yay deutschland
but do want roasts and... pie.
5That is also part of my plan. You have no need to worry.
Russel Howard? aint nobody got time for that!
:D
O.o

I don't like Knackwurst. Käsewurst is better ^^
5I know that..It was part of my plan to be part of your plan of being part of my plan.
alright then, I'll make plan too

Doctor who makes me think.
about the universe
n' stuff.
Here's what the Doctor Who article says:
as in a 1965 episode). This has all but disappeared even a few seasons in, with it becoming a pure adventure show. The last purely historical storyline, The Highlanders, aired in 1966, though a one-off return to the format, Black Orchid, appeared in 1982.

Baai Snow
/me eats pudding without having meat to spite Kammerjunk
Bye.
bye Snow
Au revoir, then
I'm plucking hairs I couldn't get when shaving my legs earlier... >-> Sometimes my leg hair decides to get caught slightly below the skin, just enough so that I can't get it while shaving, but not enough to be technically ingrown.
bai Snow
dont speak such fancy words to me!
alexxm: Consarnit!
i cant understand them ._.
Bwahaha.
Poor Snow :P
Snow: Fine, have a goddamn fine time.

5Half the ads that I see now are in Japanese.. ._.
Dashie_Dashie: I swear, she reminds me of Johhny Depp in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'.
Really? Why is that?
Right?
'Twas a good film.
5Idk.. o.o
5Unless if they're stalking me..
This chat needs more SPIDUMAN http://i.imgur.com/4dDvd.gif
I only really get Japanese ads when I visit Japanese sites.
http://i.imgur.com/kFQeU.jpg --- sometimes ... you just cant make shit up :)
5I've gotten them on a couple of random sites and on YouTube..and ever since I checked out something about Japan Rail,that ad's been popping up everywhere..

Ryunosuke do you think he changed his name to do that

new Birthday present ! http://imgur.com/jFnxj
I'd be surprised if you could even buy that around here.
Awyeah Chrysalis .
Stickers, awesome.
I've noticed that sometimes if you view certain sites it will make ads about them pretty persistent.
they track you
I got an ad with my facebook profile picture on it
If you have all your login information for all the sites you go to, I'd recommend clearing out your cookies.
Super creepy
5o.o
I just disable ads now anyways
Adblock Plus ftw
*Crickets*
Hey
Nahp.

Oi Max, more content.
Less talking.

7Meh. Big fight with my girlfriend last night. Completely demolished just /all/ the progress I'd made on the depression.
howdy DaringDerpy
and afternoon from me as well, bstate folks! :D
not much activity here now
I just noticed Piff looks like Crackle...
Max, quit lying.
:<
whos piff do you mean puff Eli
hi Sylandest ^^
woogh
alexxm: i'm pretty sure i mean Piff
forgot to do that earlier :/
ok
haha
eli...maybe you left the discussion with an unclosed insult last time...don't take it personally ^^
I don't suppose you'd want to be kicked for old times' sake? :P
hah
If you have gmod and are bored feel free to join Evrygame Ttt :3
7Not especially with the way my internet's being I'd have to completely refresh the page to get back in.
damn I hate those ambience sounds in minecraft... just saying >_><_<
No thanks.
:>
Don't worry though, we don't really care about rules in here anymore XD
7Figured.
Since barely anyone from the forum comes here
7Hey, hey, remember when you guys used to enforce rules on swearing?
And there aren't 9 year olds coming in all the time
I still think that filter was awesome tbh
[censored]ins
7I'm sorry but the only two nine year olds deserved to be slapped.
:D
7cu[censored]ber
:P
so what did you guys vote for this weel
oh that reminds me
need to vote..
good idea
before they close the vote process again
She did that?
wow
Must not've been paying attention at those points...
one day, you will watch rain man
and you will like it, because it is awesome
same as allways, Metropolis, The Trixxer, and a random Ponmy Episode
7Her 'seventeen year old sister' came in to yell at one point
Rain Man is good :)
I do remember that
That's not even a punishment
7that was funny
damn I still can't vote :'(
Or maybe I'm getting it confused with Mysterious Cynder's "dad" sending emails about why she got banned
Or why her thread got locked... or something
7They were all too annoying.
Okay now I don't even remember what my modding style was like
7I performed a sacred duty for this place.
7Sacrificed myself day and night
7Got no thanks.
7Ingrates.
I remember getting told I'm abusing power plenty of times
look before you sleep is a good episode. none of them understands anything of the others. they don't get anything, but they get along anyway
7... tbh sounds like something I'd say.
+s
Yeah, I think like 50% of it was you
hey Lil_B I just found a Gronkh Gangam style... lol

Invi I do not care about him :S sorry :(
DaringDerpy: that and it has an EXCELLENT abridged version in the mentally advanced series
MecidTheGermanBrony: specifically?
yeah but it shows still that the gangam style stuff doesn't stop for nothing Lil_B ^^
*anything
*whatever
No cause i live in germany
NullRadix: not sure if I want to see it...never heard of this series though
MecidTheGermanBrony, yeah but where in germany?

NullRadix: no, haven't seen this either...doesn't seem to be popular or well known in this community
and so he left :D
he got so excited...
hehe
I am too drunk now, I will check it out tomorrow morning
7hehe
alexxm: ah now i found out what you meant with Puff the magic dragon :) didn't get it 'till i googled
I suppose they set their focus on idiot bookworm twilight?
alexxm: but Piff is someone else. that's him http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kk5xfK0ovrk
no, twily is actually banished from canterlot in that series as far as i know DaringDerpy
he looks like crackle, right?
there are a lot of Saarland bronies afaik
DaringDerpy yeah they kinda slowed down so there's very little momentum behind them, I'm not surprised its a little obscure
Going idle. Although it probably seemed like I was idle already. XP
there are? cool
hm...sounds interesting
Hey guys, sorry to drop in with this but I didn't this listed in the FAQ. What was the time limit for entering in the lottery tonight? I know today's the last day to enter before tomorrow's stream...
dinner back soon

but they did 9 abridged episodes and 5 fanfiction parodies. I'm sure several other people around here remember them
5ish...
I'm guessing there
i found in a forum thar there should be about 2 or 3 in my town
NullRadix, they are working on My little dashie atm
it's what I recall, at least... Almost everyone I talked to in another channel, back when it was active, came out of the Saarland
MrBen: the limit is when you can send the form without "lottery closed" answer
aaaaand flash crash :P
bicyclerepairman, where were you? ^^
Invi: oh dear
Rainbow Dash Presents: My Little Dashie?

Gah! phased out there 4 a sec, what happened?
Campbell's Chunky?
RoboGerbil: its cool, just being friendly ^_^
yup.
it's delicious.
They're alright. Good enough to practically live on while dieting
I needed something to eat.
my headache was telling me too.
You could do much, much worse
No srsly, what went on while I was out?
Yes, I could
>Yellow Curry sauce.
>Tastes like farts.
no stream?
...
Dari just got done about..
what.. an hour ago?
:'(
I'm sure Shizuka or somepony will pick up the stream eventually.
quiet day today
because it's not friday.
:T
seriously whats going on?
>Writing fics and eating soup.
how is your day?
...good
:/
>Programming
yeah, and ya know what's the cure for quiet chat?
that doesn't sound bueno
DoctoDoctorWho: a party?
>Drawing
ALL CAPS?
NERD DEBATES!!
Dat Pondoo.
:$....wait?
so....
:|
Dashie_Dashie: you're writing fics? show me i'm bored
Java vs C#? Photoshop vs SAI? fanfiction.net vs fimfiction?
Alright, I know most of you don't like R34, but there was a thread on /mlp/ where people used NSFW pictures to go on Omegel, and my god I have never laughed so hard in my life.
Anypony got some juicy material to argue about?
off to class guys...see yall later tonight ^_^
Dashie_Dashie: what were you doing on /mlp/?
being a writefag.
Dashie_Dashie: ah... have you got anything non-clop?
I don't have any clop in my stories.
Dashie_Dashie: ok. then i would love to read
It's based on the thread "Anon in Equestria" if you don't mind reading that.
Brb going to go make me a sandvich
it's SFW
Dashie_Dashie: sounds like HiE
mud
AiE was wayyyyyyy before HiE.
08,01save me barry
that's where I've spent the last few months.
08,01!
waiting for the new season
Dashie_Dashie: it's Human in Equestria though? right?
I have a fic of my own but it doesnt seem very popular
08,01hullo!
hey everypony :)
DoctoDoctorWho: tell me it's name and i'll see to one more view for you
In a sense, yes Eli.
:o
I bbl all!
so is this what Bronystate is usually like on weekdays? cause im usually here on weekends.
DoctoDoctorWho: except if it's clop or HiE. that stuff smells
Bronystate has it's ups and downs on the weekdays.
mostly because of the lack of streaming
>because real life is neat.
how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
things are good alexxm :)
DoctoDoctorWho: i sure want
Real Life: The world's most popular MMO since 2.5 million BC
The lack of moonbutt threads on /mlp/ rustles my jimmies.
Time to fix that.
K, brb. But b4 I get it I have a thing or 2 to say about fics. First off, your right, Clop isnt right(shipping is tho, tee-hee). Second off, HiE isnt suckish, I actually quite like them. Third, my fic involves making blueblood not seem like a jerk. Hope you enjoy Eli!
they can all be done horribly, horribly wrong though
DoctoDoctorWho: ok, i have read some making blueblood not a jerk. He still is in my books. doesn't matter though. I don't like HiE, because every single HiE i've seen so far were random shipping oneself with HiE and sorry that sucks. Third I don't like clop much. but i make exceptions. University nights is hardly clop though
I'm currently following a HiE where the guy was turned into a Changeling. Hasn't updated in a while, but what he has written is brilliant. So much delicious headcanon.
There are some great ones, read the brony international gaurd
its awesome
Yeah, that one's great. Then again, it's by the same guy who did a Dresden Files/MLP crossover.
Kammerjunk: did or is doing?
Kammerjunk: that doesn't sound too bad. I just don't like actual HUMANS in pony stories. especialy when shiping is involved. that doesn't work out
I believe I was aware of two Dresden crossovers... I'm tracking one of them, not sure about the other
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49494/Blueblood-Un-jerked And off with you! I await your return and tales of your story in, BLUEBLOOD UNJERKED!
NullRadix: He completed one, and he might have completed another one, but he might be done with that one too.
Hold on, I have it somewhere in my fanfic folder.
I intend to make a 40k crossover once this fic is done.
Yeah, he completed one Dresen Files crossover, and is doing another.
Dresden*
Kammerjunk: the one I'm reading (I'm pretty sure it didn't finish...) picks up... hrm... the Ice Queen he is apparently in servitude to (not sure how canon that scenario is) sends him off to intervene with the MLP world because the "Nickleheads" are messing around with the MLP world
damn the Stream has been dead the last few days :/
a
b
c
d
Tomorrow is defintely going to be lulz worthy..
NullRadix: Don't think it's the same one. It's a guy called psychicscubadiver.
>2012 the movie
Deargod
Imma gonna jump on the "space marine in equestria" bandwagon
and it's the shitty 2012 too.
i wish i can make it to movie nights. my last one was months ago. ;-;
I know someone who did an amazing space marine crossover DoctorDoctorWho.
*confession bear look* i actually liked 2012
waitwaitwait. we're watching 2012?
Oh, and let's not forget Through the Eyes of Another Pony. Think Wrek did the art for that one.
2012 was ok. the last act kinda dragged on.
it's not the 2012 with massive amounts of CGI.
2012 was okay for a disaster movie
Kammerjunk: synopsis on that one? I remember the name...
Trust me, I know exactly which one it is.
I watched 2012 once. I think it was pretty bland, because I can't remember anything about it.
if it's on the b list.
Tovler: 2012 was certainly not ok... it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen
i remember years ago when people were freaking out about 2012. Now its a month away and no one gives a s*yay*
Well, I watch a lot of movies
Evening, everybrony.
evening Maavolent
2012 was badly made, completely over the top and totally ilocical
Malavolent*
Helllloooooooooowwwww PONYVILE!
hi Malavolent
lol all these disaster movie are so dull :D all they do is encourage paranoid people like those ones on tlc who have all that canned food and gas masks and what not
i mean bronystate..
and hi Sonny
heya ya'll :)
Heya, Lil_B.
Dashie_Dashie: what was it called?
NullRadix: Description is too long for me to post here, so http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-through-eyes-of-another-pony.html
Sonny: you're in bronystate :D
I corrected myself rdibp :p
pppst, pssst

has anyone checked equestria daily as of late. Im not going to spoil it this time :)
<_<?
"Thousand Son in Equestria"
Sonny I saw your Featherfront Picture
no <_<
Weatherfront*
Mods are asleep, post ponies.
weatherfront picture?
Pan's Labyrinth makes up for it though. but seriously, how could Sumica chose 2012?
the one from Nittany?
I haven't been on the EQD frontpage since for one and a half month.
Sonny yes
Lil_B: oh yes that one :D
hrm... I thought that had a Human/Luna shipping element... doesn't seem to now though...
Because S3.
Eli: its bad movie night i guess
Bad movies are the best though.
Sonny the Eyes... They always look so creepy to me!
bad movies are B
usually bronystate memes come from bad movies.
NullRadix: Oh, it has Human/Luna alright.
rdibp: pan's labyrinth isn't that bad
i love watching bad movies with other people anyway :)
Lil_B: that's because they're wide open and they're small pupils :D
THICK MC'RUNFAST.
I dunno which leigon to choose tho,
oh that was a night to remember..
rdibp i saw pans labryinth in my media class and i liked it
Lil_B: I usually do that xp
aight im back and i got me a PB and J sandwhiches i was going to make some ham sandwhiches but there was no ham just swiss cheeses thats all so yeah
chapter, pardon me
Kammerjunk: oh human/my favourite pony... *get my shotgun*
Sonny I know, but ALWAYS xD
alexxm: so i guess its sorta good sorta bad movie night
Lil_B: :p I know I know, I'll try to make them less creepier next time :p
Lil_B: I was actually going to draw celestia today
Sonny why not :P
^
:P
http://derpy.me/6p
To all you artsy people, I am so jelly, you could smear me on toast.

If they're just little things like Cellphones, then you need about 20 of them or so. If they're laptops streaming say Netflix, then yeah, it'll not only strain the network, but also the modem(s).
Well I have 2 computers connected for school
router will burn!
my dads laptop, my parents ipads
Routers don't burn. :P
Then you should be okay.
My laptop that runs wow..
Routers advertise their max up/down speed, which is, an example; 10/100 mbps.

AMD E-300 APU with radeon HD graphics 1.3 GHz for the processor
somewhere in the late summer
2.00 GB of RAM

Sonny sry, I cant detect Trolls when I have to focus at 3 SThings at once xD
hm has highlander been streamed
I have 6GB and it doesn't do that job all the time.

DESPITE what other people here might say. No.
Lil_B: no problem lil ;p
You have to manually transfer the virus over.
no stream?
nope
not atm
Ok then because My wow had a virus that mysteriously vanished over night
So Im suspecious its not gone...
do a scan?
.. and you wonder why your laptop is running slow?
Get an antivirus, there's two free choices.
ok Invi it's uploading now, only 1.9 MB bit it seems it' ssgetting a lot of interruption
Well the computer is old
AVG or avast!, either are good.
like 5 or 6 years or so
i liek avast
Lil_B, how long 'till finish?
it has SecureIT
I do as well, Michael.
Invi or... just go too sleep, xD I can show you another time
okay ^^
Well, I never heard of SecureIT. Might want to get rid of it.
nighty everypony ^^
Goodnight Invi :)
Night Invi
bye Invi
Gnight Invi
Isnt avast the one with the very loud the virus database has been updated thing?
Yes, but you can turn it off.
Night Invi :)
Look into getting a decent anti virus and track that virus down. If you really think your computer still has the virus, find the recovery CD for your laptop and reformat it.
Night, Invi. :)
But that's the most extreme case you should ever do.
aww
Can some1 find me a fighting is magic download?
hi
If he's who I think he is, he's been around forever
Hi CCCP :)

SpadeMagnes[School]: u can go with the laptop, maybe they have Wi-Fi
/me licks SpadeMagnes[School] like a puppy
how long has it been with no stream?
Anyway time to play some Pokemon
which game SpadeMagnes[School] :3
And man Black and white 2 has the biggest fuck you to people who didnt go to pokemon events
does the PaintChat work for anyone here? i miss drawing ponies with bronies.
You can get a item that increases shiny encounter rates, gotta fill the entire national dex first
and whats that SpadeMagnes[School]
wow, this Drawfriend had 2 Zelda MLP Crossovers
I think it's time to play DDR over my neighbors' heads again...
gotta love me some MM
So if you didnt get the event pokemon like mew back in the emerald days! Tought shit!
Tough shit indeed
whats everyones favorite food?
cacahuates
CCCP meat pizza
i liek chinesse food
uhhhmmmm
Food
scoota wings :3
^
Pokemon with gift ribbons are prevents from being put in the GTC right?
Right
So pokemon like Genesect,Keldeo and Melotta cant be gotten that way
Again dick move...
I like Soup, and Noodles
lawl
and good Meat
I like Noodles, and Soup
"It just has to be done well"
7I wonder whatever happened to teh almighteh th0ngz
But god damn genesect is powerful
i liek kebabs
i like vietnamese food like vermicelli bun bowls
i like turtles
I completly wrecked the elite 4 with Genesect doing the most damage
Tast The Rainbow Motha F*cker
probably too busy with Australian things
i have PaintSAI open, someone give me a poneh to sketch up
durger: Celestia? :3
Also I found a move being god damned close to uslessness as splash
^
Luna :3
'k
durger: molestia
SpadeMagnes[School]: What is it?
Imprision
Ah, I can see that.
what does it do SpadeMagnes[School]
It disables moves the opponent has that you have
So its fucking usless
"things"... I didn't even try to do that
Well, you could use it against pokemon like ditto or smeargle.
But otherwise, yeah it's not that useful.
I still love that image from black and white
what pokemons u have? SpadeMagnes[School]
3 on 3 wailord battle where is your god now
:D
Clefable metronome battle. Let the chaos begin.
wailord is best sea pokemon :3

SpadeMagnes[School]: i like swords
Welcome to corneria
i like swords
hey i just rememberd i have two friends that i shall be bring'n into da Herd although one keeps complaining about it and the other is just being forced to view da show
Panda|Drawing hi
I kind of wish I bought White 2 with Black 2
they will join
Coldays: The other one shouldn't be forced into it, IMO.
brb
Theres stuff I cant acess with out a unova link key
i like swords
I think he should see the show when he wants to.
its more of a all his friends are bronys so he wants to see why
I kind of still like Pokemon but they seem to be running out of ideas for Pokemon
and i shall show him
and back
Coldays: Ah, now I see what you mean.
Again my argument for saying pokemon is running out of ideas look at gen 1
hello CCCP ^^
I feel the urge to go skate for a bit
And gen 2.
>MFW I've got outbid by a guy that bid 500
<3
yeah fuck you too ebay
CrimsonPhoenix: Table flip?
I don't like the new Pokemon
CrimsonPhoenix: on what?
best Gen are 1-2
I'm highest for now
CrimsonPhoenix: Ouch. What were you trying to get?
pokemon sucked after season 1
http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-little-pony-FIM-plush-Hoodie-and-socks-Lyra-large-handmade-plushie-17-/271087991810
500? on what
CrimsonPhoenix you bidded on that?
I WANT THAT
I have to wonder when was the first episode of pokemon released?
Not gonna lie I would buy it too.
Was Gold/Silver in production at that time? Because Ho-oh was in it
SpadeMagnes[School] september 5th 97 I believe.
CrimsonPhoenix: for 500? well you are bound to make the creator happy
no ho oh was just a random pokemon that became a legendary later.
http://www.etsy.com/listing/110965346/twilight-sparkle-custom-plush-pony-mlp
i believe that it wasnt meant that way, it was only meant to be symbolic. iirc
They had a Derpy for bid as well but they bought it already :(
Also apperently Gen1 had several pokemon that got cut and put in Gen 2
Michael, lol black hair
CrimsonPhoenix: ikr?
Hi Derpy_Hooves
The name of the customer I just helped is "Spring Shine".
:3
Magic

G3 is my fav pokemon
I like all the gens equally.
Also Black and white two breaks master ball tradition
SpadeMagnes[School]: no master balls? :(
SpadeMagnes[School]: which is?
How so?
You get two. Not one.
Ah.
/me facehooves
Pfft, I don't mind.
I usualy save master balls for roamers
SpadeMagnes[School]: still prefer one
His drivers license lists no address.
To be honest, I never even used them.
But B/W2 doesnt have any
I mean even Latias and Latios are in it but they stay in one location
where is the other masterball? O_o
I would say...but it may be a spoiler
nobody missing me yet?

I need to make my card :)
those are just things I thought right after S2 finale through august before running out of ideas
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 15 days, 17 hours, 22 minutes, 21 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
Cypresswolf: why don't you just wait and see what yo get?
Only 15 days mroe
:) I thought it would be fun
Wait when exactly on the 10th is it airing?
S3
The usual 12:00?
of course there is a hidden rule - if even one of those is right (free space - there will be ponies) everypony wins :P
DerpyMuffins: it begins!
Its 10:00 am mountain time

SpadeMagnes[School]: from what i've seen (and i've seen a little) they are a bit more competent than the other organizations
I can say Magma/aqua is really incompetent
Is there a stream?
They nearly doomed the world because they grabbed the wrong fucking orbs

pony_124241: Top ponies? You mean, the most favorited in the community?
Your english is... not that readable.^^
SpadeMagnes[School]: My little brother loves using Bisharp. :D
7No. She just basically realised that the relationship had lasted six months, got really scared because all of a sudden things are /real/, and said a plethora of silly things.
/me proves thelonepony wrong by demonstrating on HeavyWeaPony_Guy
As a British, I find your lack of proper english disturbing
nighty everypony! HF!
Cya Michael
Night Michael
Night Michael :)
Night, Michael. :)
night Michael
im gon name two ponies that migh be couples and i nedd yall to give me your feed back
7Although I do occasionally worry that she's a nymphomaniac and if the sex hadn't been any good we would not have lasted this long.
So some rule 34?
Been there done that
7also this is why I shouldn't talk to people when sleep deprived it's almost as bad as alcohol for that little filter between brain and mouth
:D
It was quite fun
pony_124241: So you mean shipping couples?
Goodnight Michael :)
couple number 1 bigmac and fluttershy
Why the hell do people even get into relationships if they don't want them to last
BOOO
that makes no sense to me
Fluttershy is way too shy to make a move on him
Not gonna happen, fluttershy is a pure flower!
00,03Hello? Are you still alive?
Hai Scoot-Scootaloo and yes
This is major tom to ground control
but wat if he made the moves
Big mac would be too shy to make a move on her anyway.
ohai Scoots. :3
00,03err... I mean the stream...
I don't know Scoot-Scootaloo are we
/me Grabs Socks and says "You Havent Killed me Just Coldays. alot" Puts Socks Down and grabs a Sandwich
Scoot-Scootaloo! I made something for dabi!

/me nom nom nom
For those who wants to watch Iron Man 3, have a sinopsis of the first movie http://youtu.be/2APuxubWSmE
just for the sake of being in a relationship
7Not that she didn't want it to last, just that... idk. she was kind of a slut. she never had anything real until me and it's new and different.
/me cloaks and hides in a corner
00,03Is the stream on?
no
nope
Got my card ready - 2 more weeks of waiting - which means 2 more weeks to add a few more ... if I can
Scoot-Scootaloo, not on my side
no stream. Yet.
00,03there we go

Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
So pony_124241 why dont you make your own name insted of being pony_random#
and the intro would be a bit better if it was cut after the first chorus
Well if you both have different expectations it's probably best to give it up
couple 2 soarin and rainbow dash
CrimsonPhoenix: I sense a critic of this song.
alexxm Good i guess, and you ?
Socks, I don't mind the song
I'm talking about the interview in general
Too many pony random to be able to talk to the guy who asked for help ><
Interview?
inb4 what interview
7You misunderstand. It was just a momentary freak-out, we're fine now.
Ah okay
What interview? :3
argh
too late
You mentioned before you were upset about it, so I assumed it was still an issue
The interview with Living Tombstone. Duh
hows that random it could happen
Me iz confuzzed
its Spitfire and Soarin
7and, to be fair, before me she didn't believe in the concept of love and had never been with a man, so y'know I challenge her perceptions of existence a lot.
shutup marky
Guys, I don't get it. Who's being interviewed? <_<
Who do you think?
i dont know everybody?
Interview! Will someone explain to the n00b here!
I have no idea. <_<
Is this one of your first conflicts between the two of you?
pony_197042: Change your nick to something so we know who you are before you ask? :)

Heya Chrysalis :)
My fiance
Hai Chrysalis
lol
7We fight a lot. We're both very unstable individuals, and she had to change a lot to adapt to being in a real relationship. Add that to the fact she's my first girlfriend and the insane nervousness that comes with that, things have been rocky a lot.
He's been on here like twice in the past month
/me glomps Chrysalis
We wub you Chrysalis :3

I know there will be problems in relationships, as long as it doesnt get to the point that you start hating eachother
7I demand wedding pictures.

Colt_Brovakiin: read past sins, its a really well written fic
I LIke PanCakes
Scoot-Scootaloo: what about Cuppins?
Or Waffles? :3
usee /nick
I cried at first when I read MLD, now its just overrated
7Impressive that you have such good links to judgemental fourteen year old bitches from my highschool. Or disturbing.
?
exactly
I don't remember hearing anything about you being gay here, but you just started it up again
pony_241922: nope it is just '/nick' :D
sorry :P
If there was..

It was probably IRL
then type what ever you want it to be
yo guys Iain is my actual name
7aye.
:P
anyone here read "And I Shall Call Them Cuppins" ?
They called you gay IRL because you looked like it?
Nope
7awh I thought I'd shocked you into silence with my casual apology. :P
Never have or will
7acted, really. Idk. it's a stupid stereotype.
Nah, just switched to a different window
No worries btw
lol didn't i tell you guys about how all my 13 year old sisters friends are attracted to me?
7Yes.
7frequently.
Cya everypony, I'll be back later
7we care less with each telling
Iain: yo guys, Ian is my name.
I probably missed that.
Goodbye Derpy_Hooves :)

I feel sorry for other Derpy
anyways bye DerpyMuffins :$
looks like a good book
7*shrug* I'm in a new school now and apparently I grew up somewhat attractive so there's the odd admiring glance/discussion about me from lower school people.
Still having problem pony_241922
I'm completely oblivious to when people like me
I remembered why I tried steering away from playing FPS titles on Xbox. They make me rage .-.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcQxXpFIID0 mine too...
People tell me some guy is flirting with me and I don't believe them
Ill make sure people don't like me with all my pony swag.
7when you catch random year 10s staring at your ass it's hard to ignore.
No video links during stream. :)
ya mark still am
hahaha
okay :P
that's kind of creepy
7little bit but I have massive body and confidence issues so y'know I'll take my compliments where I can
7(Note: year 10s, not ten-year-olds. British 'grade' system: they're about fifteen.)
http://cheezburger.com/6697957632 :D it's a MLB post
heh... won't say I can't relate to you there
I never had confidence issues because I never actually knew how nerdy I was.
*am
:3 And THAT'S why Spitfire needs a song!
00,03No video links during Official Streams~
some reason? some fashion?
7I lucked into a hot girl who finds my nerdiness adorable.
Cypresswolf: that comment gave me cancer
it's not a video...
the only thing that bothered me was when I had bad acne at the beginning of middle school
ohai pony_094024 :>
But I got over it.
7My skin has always been /flawless/
pony_241922
Bleh
aw he's gone
I _still_ get acne and I'm 21
7ouch

Scoot-Scootaloo, we sure act like one though
We are so a cult Scoot-Scootaloo
we're a cult?? i knew it!
Scoot-Scootaloo but i wanted to sacrifice people :(
Scoot-Scootaloo yet.

Scoot-Scootaloo: awwwww but i wana be cult ittttttts not fair
Chrysalis you can still sacrafice the goat
We must sacrifice the RPers
^
Alesiopdv: is best community!
Not wise. The RPers are educated on the ways of dice and LARPing, they'd win in a pitched battle.
We can be a community, but I can't see ourselves as a cult.
And you'd be pelted with lots of bird seed packets.
oni_link True that!
aww yeeeee :3
00,03After the inital interview, I have a couple of... bonus scenes~

Why do they need space suits?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Stange considering they could breathe in space in the movie
FlutterMEDIC: I know, right? :S
The show glorifies being stupid.
I question why he thinks a trio of super powered girls would need the robot
FlutterMEDIC: He's not. He's a jackass and a idiot :<
SpadeMagnes[School] well they have to advertise the toys

NOT FLY PAPER
I just saw a frame of something that looks interesting between parts
Hi Vash
NOT THE BEES!
I remember this, It's really one of his better plans.
inb4 he gets stuck to the paper
You could just use yur laser vision to zap the paper........
Evilsqirrel :D
AJIsAwesome: shush! You're ruining the moment!
notice the fly paper is in only a small part of the room
OKay. :D
they could have landed anywhere
also, they can FLY
man he is REALLY suckin it up
Vash: they fly in on mojo often enough
lordy
or MELT THE PAPER
You guys have to remember-- in the end thyey are little girls.
A freakin' mace?
Man, my childhood had a lot of violence... Much more than I remember.
Kencolt: True. :D
why do you have a sword in your desk....
Oh girls, you've fallen from orbit, been blasted and hit by how mnay monsters? and you're afraid of a sword and chainsaw?
O_o
NullRadix: And he KNOWS WHERE THEY LAND.
inb4 blood
Vash: Well, they ARE sharp.
lol
A katana, darts, batttle axe, how much shit does this guy have?
Indeed. Why did Mojo Jojo count on the girls landing? Maybe he had plans to force them to the ground if they didn't land.
Use a spoon!
a cannon
lit bombs, great
acid?!
O.O
tiger....
use the lemons
Tiger?
11,01Me?

He gon be trippin wit all dat acid, boy.
Ok Overkill definition
I like how things could still be violent back then but we didnt have over protective parents getting on the networks cases
Tac pin?
Hey, it's Tigger!
*ahem* as noted. The girls just break in on him often enough. They probably got into a routine. Or we're all overthinking it and should be laughing at Mojo's overconfidence scene
HOLY SWEET JESUS
you think he would have3 got the stuff together before hand
Every Known Deathtrap known to villany! This is sheer genius!
i mean and, not but
that cant be a safe place to sit :)

DerpyMuffins that is so sad
both bubbles and blossom have special abilities
Lunar_Brony: she can speak squirrel
J_E_Smith71 umm, yes?
but not buttercup for some reason
it's one of her powers, along with spanish
no one at pokeyoaks cares i guess

WOO!
Oh, Proffesor. :D
OH, right, yeah.

Dat phone
oh god... power puff girls
The squrriel just so happens to have PPG bug eyes
why am i even awake at this hour?
Eli: Why not?
wut
aw
oh its back
ok
I wondor why we never hear about chemical x from any place other than the professor
dat stock scream
Vash perhaps he discovered how to make it?
hahah, he's getting rabies
because its something the professor invented and then never replicated
"It fell off a truck, officer. I swear."
Vash: He's the ONLY one who knows the formula.
Evilsqirrel: na, Lil_B and i just noticed the 6th coop test chamber block in Portal2 and we HAD to do them :)
though they play with chemical X once and awhile. Cue Bunny the retarded power puff girl. that one guy who was evil etc.
ew
...............
also the rowdy ruff boys too
Ew
tasty
dat .. jealousy?
alexxm he's a professor, publishing that knowledge would make his career, his life, and he descorved it then before he made the girols
Moral: Use CHEMICAL X on everything
TheMaster actually they got their powers form a jail toilet
man i can't spell today, please excuse me
because the jail toilet had the same consistency as chemical x for some reason
Vash he probably knows that if something like a super solider serum would end up being used for evil i guess
Bye everypony, goin airsoft shoppin
made from snips, snails, and puppy dog tails, including chemical x
Bye BroPony|MEDIC|AFK :)

Bye BroPony|MEDIC|AFK

Bronysith: Daww :3

Shizuka: http://imgur.com/WdCX8 thoughts ?
i thought 1.4 just got released today?
did it?
holy shit it did!
:3
I notice that it's looking different than usual. So this is the new version?
http://www.tickld.com/images/content/28994.jpg still a better love story than twilight

08,01# it's hard to work on an assemblyline of broken hearts / not supposed to fix them, only strip and sell the parts #
/me 08,01rocks out
Kandarihu this is a texture pack with atleast one mod added
this is tekkit :)
aw... that's actually pretty cute
yeah i agree
And to think, I was waiting all day for Shizuka to come on and start streaming JUST so I can play Left 4 Dead 2 with her on the stream. And she comes on, to play Minecraft.
Kandarihu: aw lol
Life's a bitch, eh?
then you die:
?
texture packs, reminds me of my old OOT re-runds

is that auto-miner part of industrial craft?
I had a Fierce Deity patch so I had the Helix Blade in place of the Big Goron Sword :3 ah good times. Also I liked playing dungeons or arenas that people made.
13it's in technic but not tekkit
hi
13singleplayer not multiplayer
that's pretty bitchin
But if she's busy with Minecraft 1.4, who am I to insist that she passes up this newness for something she doesn't have interest in?
So this isnt tekkit?
13look at him go :3
interesting though
lol
so it builds it's own tracks?

Hi, Meanwhile. :)
Hi Meanwhile
Bit quiet in here isn't it.
It's a school night.
Youre quiet
you even have one to collect the tracks? sweet
11,01Hi Meanwhile.
It was a school night yesterday, didn't slow the chat much.
what happened yesterday?
05time to hype amnesia 2
Wrek: NOPE
Probably because a lot of quizzes and tests take place on Fridays
There's an Amnesia 2?
Nothing of note happened yesterday. At least not that I saw, but chat was more active.
Wait...it's almost November.
11,01Bay of Pigs?
11,01No.
Yeah Amnesia 2: A Machine For Pigs.
11,01A Machine of Pigs.
machine for pigs
11,01Or whatever.
Well it's probably time for midterms too.
Midterms were two weeks ago for me
war pigs :3
Depending on where you live.
It looks quite steampunk. Should be interesting. Assuming they don't sell out.
11,01I didn't stay into Amnesia 1 enough to finish it.
ok cachi01 and AJIsAwesome this is how i will convince my mom to get to movie night.......
I don't have midterms, fuck yea.
huh, I do need window curtains, but i'll pass
I sure as hell don't
/me MOM: Edward, I’ve come to bitch and moan at you about why you shouldn’t watch the movies
I live in a basement. Windows are overrated
And Windows 8 debuted yesterday.
Whoop de doo?
Dark92Enigma: ur name is edward?
/me ME: And I, the wise genius, have yet another reason about why I should DOSO
Back in my days windows were something you had in your walls.
cachi01: Eduardo.....
howdy everypony
Ooh, so it IS laying down it's own track!
how are y'all
Dark92Enigma: oh :)
'Lo PeachStreak.
Hi, PeachStreak. :)
my only curtain is a blanket, and since it's so dark it absorbs heat, and makes my room too hot :(
also tekknik pack?
Hi PeachStreak
ITS BECOME SENTIENT
You feeling better? :)
cachi01: don't compare me with other character that shares the same name with me
KILL IT
PeachStreak: Yep.
AJIsAwesome: i'm not done yet, bro
Got it, Dark92Enigma. :)
allo PeachStreak
Dark92Enigma: i was about to do it ;:D
RustyMeat, but it does all the stuff you're too lazy to do yourself.
me?
Hi PeachStreak :)
/me MOM: “I can’t support you!”
I use blinds, bit more variety than streak of light or pitch blackness.
Thats how it starts
ya totally made a scene pony need to colour
I live in the living room. I sleep on the couch. I have my computer on a coffee table in front of the couch.
Cool. :)
So you live on the couch. Basically.
/me ME: “FINE!” (pause) “So, you coming to the third act to Watch it with me?
I have curtains up and it gives my room a red hue.
Needs to be darker, since winter is fast approaching.
/me MOM: “Don’t I always?”
I want the dark room to last as long as possible.
/me ME: COOL
AJIsAwesome: There
I like winter.
^
S'almost Halloween. Who likes Halloween?
If I can get my new computer put together, I's also going to be in the living room.
I prefer fall.
I LOVE Winter.
winter's awesome
I like Halloween
I like Fall too. :)
Halloween's okay.
actually, Fall's my favorite of the seasons
Hopefully if I have enough money after buying my glasses, I'm gonna get my costume
Ah, now I see what Shizuka was doing.
i want thanksgiving so i can get fat
i like to call it NOSTALGIAWEEN
i prefer winter to the smmer, but it depends where yo live. winter can be a pain if everything is covered in ice
if it's still in the store, that is << >>
AJIsAwesome: its just a head I only doodled a head base but it still looks good
twilight_sprinkle: Same.
ThePillowship: If you're tight on money, you can buy medical gauze and go as the invisible man.
Randomnerd, I dun wanna.
the water got shut off for my neighboorhood. They better turn it back on by tomorrow morning or I'm gonna have to go to school with my hair looking like I just woke up :P
My favorite park looks dead and barren during the winter but great the rest of the year
05The game was originally set to release before Halloween 2012, but was delayed to early 2013 due to overwhelming response and to meet the expectations.[4]
05in other words
05machine for pigs could have been out right now
what game>
?
05but alas
it ain't
But wasn't because they wanted it to be good enough? Sounds like a decent reason to me.
Inb4 it's a repeat of Duke Nukem Forever.
05Meanwhile it is decent
oh
05but if would be perfect timing
You wait for like 2 decades and then it just sucks so hard it collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.
05to release before holloween
I'd be happy enough with some more high profile horror movies over this period.
All I've heard recently is that Silent Hill 2 is meant to be out soonish.
oh, I know this one . . .
I still need to finish I mean start VVT pony
/me Epic dance in minecraft
umm . . . DAMMIT what's the name of this song?
Hm, could it handle the lava? Can it lay tracks over the lava?
Or finish grudge pony that I originally sketched.
I'm out of ideas.
Kandarihu it puts down stone and then a rail
Lunar_Brony, I see.
ThePillowship: VVT pony?
oklahoma!
PeachStreak, were you here when Shizu streamed Harry Potter Rifftrax?
nope
I just got here
13oops
sup guys.
allo RDash5000
Well...
13forgot to step down the voltage on the extractor
sup RD
that happened
So it exploded?
13this is what i get for running high voltage through my house
music... sounds so familiar
13kept the resin at least
Hi RDash5000 :)
if you're familiar with the Harry Potter series, Lord voldemort is so fearted that people are afraid to say his name
Minecraft's looking a lot more complicated than when I last played it. What mods're running on this?
ohh
So when people start to say it, it starts off as "V--"
Tekkit, I think.
13technic pack
13so about 50
It's a real testament to the complexity of this game when something like that is even a concern
What Shizu said.
this music reminds me of twister.
13thaaaat would be because i've been playing the twister OST this whole time silly filly :3
and the modders have used minecraft better than mojang together
YAY
I WAS RIGHT :d
When I finally buy MC, I don't know if I should keep it vanilla or play with mods
no, you said it REMINDED you of it
didn't say it was
Back in my day we made houses out of dirt. And we were happy!
Meanwhile, back in my day we made houses out of SOD
god i love twister
Meanwhile when was your day, Indev?
ThePillowship if this is like your fist time using minecraft, probably should try vanilla until you feel comfortable to try some mods
Lunar_Brony: Idk, like, 6 months ago.
AJIsAwesome: what colour should the mane be green,purple, and pink or what....?
Ugh... blanket time.
Dken2021, well i do have Minecraft but I got it by other means so Ihave no choice but to play vanilla
I'm sore and chilly.
PeachStreak: Probably Green. :)
ahahaha, i google the point of eccentricity and among common searches is "point of view", thats the internet in a nutshell right there
WHats this song called?
Randomnerd: blanket time is best time
And why am I still ThePillowship?
I thought this was gonna be a temporary thing
Because you're slow?
13little miner is just now coming back
AJIsAwesome: I mean scene hair is usually multi coloured
oh right, you were PillowPoni right?
I guess I should be lucky that I ccan do something about being cold and chilly.
PeachStreak: What pony is this?
Dken2021, yes.
my scene one
Meanwhile, nope. The slow moments appear when jokes are being told and explained to me like I'm five.
Been a while since i lastly was in this room :O
HOld on.
Meanwhile then you were running 1.2.5. Back then, I had a house made out of Obsidian and full gold armour.
Meanwhile, about your joke about making houses out of dirt. I have a link that pertains to that.
Hi Airpuff :)
05finally
hi Airpuff
Hello :P
05what minecraft misses is the decoration versatillity of terraria
05when minecraft has that
Lunar_Brony: I was kidding. But I'm inclined to point out that gold is a really bad metal for defensive purposes.
05ill be sooo happy
ello Airpuff, how's it been?
Hi, Airpuff. :)
:3
Dken2021 fine i guess ^^
I've never played Terraria.
13wrek did you see my cabin?

"[21:10] <Meanwhile> Back in my day we made houses out of dirt. And we were happy!" http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/CEB_Press
Don't even THINK about saying that again.
Kandarihu: Exactly.
I've always looked more for function than form when I make Minecraft stuff

I'd suggest using the banner timer that EqD uses, but it has a Season 3 background, so the timer itself is a spoiler
06O_o
Bronysith: yes there is http://i.qkme.me/353iex.jpg
06then I would nom you
08,01Kandarihu: obama doesn't want to treat gay people as second class citizens
just because of who they may vote for or oppose...
Politics in Bronystate?

Better make some popcorn.

I was on EQD and I was reading some fan fics and...... IT WAS SO GOOD!
nope, I would live in a jar and then have someone bury me somewhere where nobody could find me, so I could live as spam for the rest of eternity
Bronysith: done that like 1000 times lol
congrats Prodigy_X!
They cloud your judgement
I wish I could vote for George McGovern as president honestly
08,01Kandarihu: he wants to amend your constitution so that gay people will never have the right to marry
