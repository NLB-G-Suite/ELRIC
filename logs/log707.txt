Like games
Some are replayable, some aren't, but after I beat it, its never the same
still good, but not the same
Studying can't talk sorry.

Correct!
Like how "lasagna" is pronounced "lasaña"
"lasanya"

timing and context

In about 20 minutes we are going to be filled to the brim with quotes like that
nah, I'll most likely keep quiet about them unless I find opportune moments to interject
remember - timing and context

Yow!
o.o

/me 's computer begins to smoke
I was about to ask why you'd need a picture that finite, but THAT'S a pretty good reason
Not finite...
That's not the right word...
I was looking for a more specific descriptor than that, but I guess that works
Infinite?
:P
gtg cya
No, not infinite
Macro?
:P
zelda
^ is good
I suppose the wording I was looking for was "I was about to ask why you'd NEED 9 Gigapixels, but that's a pretty good reason"
querk want to be saved by link
:D
Damn, that's a WHOLE lotta' stars.
That's a lot of stars
And fishes.
Is there a stream up?
Gonna head out early. Husband's coming home sick. :<
<Harsh Language> GEMA! blocking Gangnam Style... They do NOT have the Rights, I guarantee it!"
.................wut
blocking*
sry, I was eating now
oh, k
Of course I'm here
I was watching one ow these Halloween Light Music Videos, and I saw one for Gangnam style
I'm always here
GEMA*
I just then jumped back into my programming
U r a computer savvy person?
I'm a programmer. As part of being a programmer, you often become at least partially computer savvy
/me coughs
go on...?
hai everypony :3
a) you are touching on a subject I have very, VERY limited knowledge of. I don't work with audio much ( but might in the foreseeable future)
as far as an actual answer... it may or may not be possible depending on the music format (I think)
/me join stupidsexytwilight
FUCK
LOL
i need to learn slashes
I would imagine... in the BEST possible scenario for that... the data for each singer is stored separately
more likely, it's all stored in one stream of data, and while you may be able to use audio programs to pull that person's voice out, it would effect the rest of the track
Personally, I'm going to assume xmasmare|Almond's blunder was in fact, NOT a blunder... and in fact... A TRAP!
We can view a person's joined channels with /whois, anyway.
Well, that is the second time you've done it though. :P
Is there a stream going on?
why quit when we have the master of kicking right here?
excuse me, banning.
:I
I'm glad they're going back for the Turn-based RPG

UK curry as opposed to US curry...
0612:'D
08,01UK curry is kinda rubbish
o.o?
3How the- o.o
and noone ever dies
08,01most UK food is, tbh
a little bit
Dudesons are the definition of "YOLO"
08,01but there are some exceptions
3*ulquiorra_dance*
08,01Kurra: if you're ever in Edinburgh, go to the Mosque Kitchen
<3
08,01they do really good curries
Saturn.
wut r u doing
08,01Kurra: i'm kinda immune to chilli

08,01obviously, it depends on how it's made
LOL
08,01and everyone feels chilli differently
XD
Yes, but if they don't have anything like chilis in
Which a lot of curries don't
GOTTA RUN FAST.
they burn.
...
why is this hilarious
08,01prince-dari: most curries contain either chilli or pepper
There are tons that don't
I wear stetsons.
if you see only squares, you won't get any :D
stetsons are cool.

I dunno, I can't see the actual characters
curry pumpkin PIE GUYS
i just see trees
08,01and since pretty much all indian cooking uses masalas
0612Now I don't even need to have the same nick to confuse everyone :D
Just because a lot do, doesn't mean plenty don't
Fuken chiken nuggets
:D I don't know why, but I can see butterflies there
fuuuuuuckiiing chiiiicken nuuugets
English and Indian curry are two entirely different things anyway

apart from curry, someday I'd like to go to the UK and just try all manner of foods and beers that accompany them well :>
he's UKs Remi Gaillard huh?
:D
awww snap
oh, I thought my client was being stupid again
AWW SHIT NIGGA
Dayum.
its like a mankey!
Usually it shows special characters as a combination of random symbols
MANKEY.
08,01prince-dari: trust me on this, my mum is an Indian chef. there are practically no curry dishes that don't contain chilli
08,01it's used for flavour, not just hotness
DAMN THEM MANKEYS!
4Yep.. :D
[19:03] English and Indian curry are two entirely different things anyway
08,01English curry is not curry
:(
yeah
I thought it was.
English 'curry'
Well, except we call it curry
13maybe
⌨⌨⌨ :D
O.o\
I thought UK foods were like Indian. 'cuz you know, it'd be cool to try somthing awesome that people go to little holes in the wall for, little places that make great foods...
dat time
keyboards
of all hurricanes.
5You are all part of my plan.
Saturn, awwh, there has to be awesome things....
08,01Kurra: roasts
08,01that's all this country can do well
08,01and sausages
anyway
0614It's an evil plan
08,01and even then, we don't do sausages as good as Germany
5Renji_Abarai..you have been part of my plan from the beginning..
/me changed the topic of channel again :)
/me wins :)
Eh, I prefer normal sausages to bratwursts
is this the English version of "The soup" that america has?
but do want roasts and... pie.
5That is also part of my plan. You have no need to worry.
:D
08,01prince-dari: Germany has many, many, many kinds of sausage
O.o
08,01not just Bratwurst

Rain Man is good :)

That's not even a punishment

nighty everypony! HF!
7Although I do occasionally worry that she's a nymphomaniac and if the sex hadn't been any good we would not have lasted this long.
Been there done that
:D
It was quite fun
BOOO
