Tennant is the best because he's the /best/ looking.
Doctor Who
I mean 14th
GOKIAGER!
06Project, let us get on it ;3

There isn't a 12th doctor......yet

Question?
I liked watchmen...
night luna
see ya... but why you say tonight?
watchmen

Goodnight Luna! Love you!
Watchmen was awesome, what are you talking about
Why haven't I seen many pony and LoL crossovers

<3
the movie ok
Okay sweet! Shall I post my Credit Card info? Social Security number? Both?
07,01because I live in a different timezone
What classic doctors does BMN like?
2,14 are you kidding? For trying to put such an amazing graphic novel into cinema, Watchmen did fabulous
I am disappoint.

Good night everypony! See you all tomorrow!

I SPEAK ENTIRELY IN ACRONYMS

SUPPRISE!
OH GOD
i dont even know whats going on
but that seemed important

So
oh hai there...
how are they gonna get there?
Yeah, it was. xP
I can't imagine picking up the show on this particular episode.
oh no the loose chain is without power
ok
so
inb4 she dies
the watch had a time lord spirit in it
and took over his body
lol Sumica
and hes evil for some reason?
inb4 they both die.
oh shit.
Oh no, the professor was always a time lord. He just hid his memories in the watch.
kill ALL the scientists!
ohhhhhh
ok
Lets go this way! No wait lets go that way!
so
why is he evil
They explain it in an earlier episode when the doctor does it to escape the family of blood. Like I said, I can't imagine starting to watch the show here.
why is he evil
I have a lazer pointer that looks remarkably like a Sonic Screwdriver
He's evil because he has always been evil.
aw
I want it
Master! MUAHAHAHAHA!
dat after effects
He was evil in oldwho too. Though, they kinda explain that later in the show why exactly he's crazy.
Oh snap
Name drop!
all timelords evil except the main guy?
Noes ;_____;
Nope. Well, they're all dead.

He uses that lock a few times
I HAVE THE POWER!

Hurts so good.
Someone's happy.
Timewar and whatnot.
Wait, so the Doctor is also the Master?
HEre'S JOHNNY!
The Master is the master
deliopen: there are two time lords
The Doctor is the doctor
When do we see The Master in a dress?
The doctor is the doctor and the Master is the master, they are two different people but are the same species
Seriously, that was an awful coice of music for that scene. I was totally expecting batman right then.
So that wasn't the Doctor's watch, it was a different Time Lord's watch?
yeah
deliopen yes.
yes, same technology
ah kk
Leaving you here to rot doc have fun!
aw man
That was the master's watch. Any timelord can do the watch trick if they have the chameleon circut thingy

CSI: Time travel
Jack had a time travely watchy thingy
hes a time lord
The song I was quoting comes on on this episode, correct?
he's the Doctor's archnemesis
there was a time war a long time ago
that killed them
All
The Master is crazy.
He's a Time Lord, a crazy, murderous Time Lord.
He was in oldwho
...everyone but the doctor.
He hates the Doctor.
the Venom to his Spider-Man
He wants to kill everyone
love this one
He had a cool mustache
dat sexism

He ditched his rubbish beard.

I love this scene.
ahhh, this part
...exactly what ours is doing
I wonder...what would happen if the Doctor was regenerated as a female?
...It can happen
I would cry. But it is possible.
RAWRity that would be awesome
That was actually the basis of a comedy skit iirc.
Its canonnly possible
really.
/me would totally do this if he were in power.
It was, the guy writing seasons 5 & 6 wrote that skit Aponymous
them reaction faces
he looks like Simon Pegg

hi StarEcho :)
heya :)
NO BACKSTORY FOR YOU
Whats with timelords not having real names?
seriously
Master
They do o.o;
Doctor
names are so last genoration.
They have names, we just don't know them.
because they all are born with screennames instead of actual monikers
I know im just saying
they have Equestria esk names
The Monk
why cant they just tell people their names?
seriously
oh she is a time lord too? The wife!
Because I dunno.
their names have to do with their specialty
It's like if we were all to just start using our forum screen names IRL
nope
well, Jon
Yay, its officially October here!
That would be AWESOME!
I am using my real name online.
Because how dissapointed would you be if the Doctor's name was Harold Johnson?
so yeah
Wait you all made up your screen names?
if an enemy were to go to back in time, they could find them as a child with their real name, and kill them
HA!
...Time war is timelocked.impossible to go in
so thats not a problem.
The Cake is also a lie
lol Sharon Ousbourne.
suddenly Osbourne
Ahaha

Probably mispelled osbourne.
I want to vote Saxon now
Tick her box!
OSBOURNE?! How the heck did I miss that?!
My name is ridiculously clever, I took Anonymous, and changed one of the Ns to a P. CLEVER!
I totally never would have though of that.
mine's even more clever. I added a W to rarity
archangel?
my SN is based off a song from the Foo FIghters
Mine is the best. I blatantly stole it.

Too many babies!
*Shrug*sorry
so...were they trying for a serious arc and just gave up, or were they trying to be funny and just sucked beforehand?
No one gets it : foreveralone.jpg :
1/10 of humanity gone...oh my god.
Fucking just...think of that.
Doctor Who is a mix of serious and cheese.
The guy writing this season was really hit and miss.
Especially this arc.
and she ran, she ran so far
Well, the main guy.
This arc was win
Remember that the Plague wiped out 2/3.
but thats
I still don't like how this arc ends.
800000 people
dead.
not realy safe though
They'll get over it.
Now credits.
Jon I am really not a fan of people so...
I can understand wanting some comic relief and all, but that just ruined what could have been a serious moment.
I think you're a few zeroes short, jon
this arc was going somewhere interesting and they kill it dead in the last episode. martha gets screwed
Thats why we watch ponies :P
Near the ending of the final ark kinda pissed me off, and you will see why in the next episode
^
That "^" was for LAg
sorry 2 zeros short
well, I'm out for bed
oh so that is how they get you to come back.
I thought the ending was a bit poor too.
yay
later everyone
But meh.
Darf14, eeyup
Tinkerbell Jesus....
still liked the drums
It's like if, when they defeated discord, and while they did it, Nyan Cat starting playing.
Preping my bucket
RAWRity: That would have been awesome. :P
Nighty night ThePretender
ok then...
yeah, you're right; his voice is crap.
Ok close your eyes everypony

it looks cheaper than the Newborn ponies
indeed it did Dariy
Balthazar wut
Dr. Who has saturday morning cartoon
It's actually alright.
It's better than Dreamland.
if only to know it's horror
Compared to Faust? Doesn't exist.
october first 2011 2:48 am est...
Never saw the animated Doctor Who so I cant pass judgement on it yet
' /)^3^(\
It's a little bit childish, though.
here i am
Dreamland's animation was terrible. WE SHOULD WATCH IT!
happy october everypony

^
I don't really like this arc that much...
Happy October!
I've got another 12min 'til October.
everyones in #bronystate if you really want to get a word in :P
Oh god i just remembered the end and how bullshit it is
I still like these 3 episodes.
deliopen: this
NO SPOILS PLZ!

Yeah the ending killed it
but I might have caught the end of this
the payoff is bullshit
It has been October for nearly 8 hours here.
Gunna be tired tomorrow. XD
Playing Advanced Wars 2 on my phone and watching Doctor Who.... life is good.
he dari can you umm move the thing just a bit?
50mins :P

Planet Earth is closed D=

Welcome to the hotel californa's beach
It's been October here for almost 3 hours.
Brohoof for mountain time zone Darf!
There's some stuff that was left out of the itunes version...
*Brohoof*
Mountain?
im off by a couple seconds excuse me for rounding...
Mountain here
Yeah, I live in mountain time
What states?
Lag for a bit.
i think its paused?
lemme guess Montana?
I saw the other episodes with the master are good
not sure if want face
sorry if i spoiled.
Oh, it must be paused.
T'was weird.
No
it was
*'Twas
Im in alberta
13How do you mean?
Eugh no.
Utah here
When they bring back the Master he sucks.
These episodes are far superior.
I live in a desert, sorry I dont want to give away my exact location just yet
I don't clearly remember
DAT PUN
The Master Race was an awesome pun though.
BEST SCENE!
I love this song
Eastern Time zone is best time zone!
Pinkie strikes again
Oh my god.
oh.
Oh my godddd yeesss
THIS SONG
this song
IS AWESOME
I forgot about this.
Discord lives on!
I forgot too.
I LURVE THIS SONG <3
awww yeah
what is this fucker's obsession with crap music?
I love this guy.
Has anypony made a Discord PMV with this song?
Onscreen: This is somebody's fetish
they need to
This song actually fits perfectly.
somepony made a video with pinkie pie singing this song in tf2's dustbowl
We know mole.
not quite enough
ah
k
The_Mole pm me a link!
Incoming awesome.
just a minute... i dont recall the title of it but its probably in my youtube history
hold on
It'sd called Pinkie Can't Decide
I Can't Decide is the song.
pinkie can't decide
ah well thanks
wow i thought the view count was a lot smaller
Theres barely any metal in russia.
of course not
the fuck are they the biggest?
the master used it all
This reminds me of, what was it, the 3rd book in Hitchikers.
How so?
Russia is the biggest country.
lol balls
Life, The Universe, And Everything.
Unless the master transports metal
those shipyards are a giant phallic symbol
That was only about Galactic war, and not in this way.
Nah, they wanted to destroy the Universe.
Remember the sun bomb thingamabob?
>end of the world
>asks for a date
...Does the doctor just secrete love phermons?
Well yes, but because they're minds were so small.
I know right?
...No wait thats Jack nevermind
The Cricket robots?
No, the people of Krikkit.
I never thought the romance between The Doctor and Martha
was believable
It was just Martha pinning after him. Pretty irritating .
And getting jelly everytime Rose's name came up.
The romance thing is why I never really cared for Rose and Martha.
Rose was believable
Gene locked.You lose.
Bitchslap/
THAT AWFUL PUNCH
always one step ahead
seriously. Just kill yourself, regenerate, kick his ass.
He's making sure he wont die i bet.
mebbe regeneration doesn't work for suicide
So I was looking forward to you showing these eps Dariy, but then i realise I already saw them >_<
Or he's supressing the regeration.
get them to sneak him a small piece of glass. slit his thrat
thoat even
throat even
umm...if the master just shot him again while he was
he would die for real
so...yeah
dizzy
if he takes too much damage to his body he cant regenerate and he will die for real
Or gets killed in mid regen he would die.
Just wondering how many other people besides me got the moderator position.
Alot.
gandolf
Wait, what's his name?
Gandalf?
No.
Dobby.
"he
Like, as in, Gandalf the Grey?
*Right there*
Inb4 Doctor Dobby
Or, technically, if he died, regenerated, died, regenerated, died again he'd be out of luck.
Daffy Duck mode activate
IT'S THE HAMSTER DANCE
Unless there was only just one opening. In that case nevermind.
old guys got some moves
Damn that soundtrack
i like it.
sumica - wow XD
WHO THOUGHT THAT EFFECT WAS GOOD?
Erm.... no one?
i liked it
lol i forgot what this scene looked like
I di-*shot*
*raises hand*nah just kidding.
dobby!
ahhh kill it with fire
First time I saw this episode, I fell asleep and woke up to that.
HOLLY SHIT VOLDEMORT
oh god it's just a head
turned him into CG
Ah, I see why you call it Dobby Mode.
'Twas freaky.
^
Time left?
"taking apart all buildings and cars"
"He's been turned into Dobby, great!:)"
"Has huge warehouse"
Later, bronies.
ground to air missles hitting satalights...
Bye Applejackismaiwaifu
bye Applejackismaiwaifu
SAM missles vs. Sattelites?
yeah, see you later Applejackismywaifu
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
cya applejackismaiwaifu
well
jiggawat!
Like I was saying, In Life, The Universe, and Everything, the people of Krikkit were violently introduced to the universe when a spaceship crashed on their planet.
Yeah i can make tons of power using a gas generator
...totally.
jigga-whaaaaaat.
i guess not all computers are hooked up to the network
Gotcha~
Incoming what.
They had never concieved exsitance beyond their planet before, so they decided it had to go.
good thing they dont like explode when you do that.
lol
that would be bad, sumica
or send backup when one goes down.
Which Doctor is this?
10.
Mr. Owl, How many lightning bolts does it take to get to the center of a Toclafane?
One... One!
Lets see 1...2....3
1
aw, it's nice to see the destruction of humanity has healed their family strife
mfw you can spell Toclafane :O
...Oh god japan.
oh god russia
oh god everything
Best who word is raxacoricofallapatorian
What about Qualm?
is it really a Time Lord Empire when only the emperor is Time Lord
all cause he had a messed up childhood.
I don't like this thing's voic
it makes it alot creepier than it needs to be.
So what are the Toclafanes?
Well it is a creepy thing.
wow that was easy
nvm, don't tell me
bout to find out
wait for it.
probably spoilers
here comes the twist
You're about to find out
probably... yep
it's actually rose?
guessed it.
it's clearly setup beforehand... because what would most break the Doctor's hearts?
kill it with fire
IT'S ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
Hi human.
Hey its that little girl that I say that she would do great things in the futute....dang she is ugly.
Oh, I was a bit wrong.
and we have closer
wait... that's a little boy i thought
Able to kill cause of the paradox machine
"My balls are SO PRETTY"
:D
XD
lawl Aponymous
Lawl
Note that it can hold a paradox unaltered
who would have thought that trying to flee into space without any idea where we would going would turn out /badly/ ?
when i first saw the previous episode, I thought of Phantasm and The Tall Man...
ummm..its either that or you stay annd die with a 100% chance of death
Roll your dice and lose.
and his flying balls of necromantic death
I'm just saying, who the hell actually thought they were gonna get somethign good?
OMG! IM A MONSTER!
It was more hope then thinking.
Me!
Toclafane are such player-killers.
They did, they were desperate
Toclafine=teamkillers.
/me sips wine from his baby skull
*blood
it's like "The universe is ending, but we'll go to some vague, unspecified utopia" wasn't a great idea
a rivet gun?
The elements of Harmony!
Chemical gun.
mfw Martha has apparently been playing The Legend of Zelda for the last year
...or you know...just keep shooting.
Chem gun is chem gun.
still looks like a rivet gun.
That would work too.
You know, that probably IS a rivet gun.
WE'LL KILL THE EVIL MASTERMIND WITH A PAINTBALL GUN
pop rivet mind you not the big iron ones
Rawrity
that gun is gonna be important
trust me.
I'm more making fun of the design
It's very important
half life 2
That gun is going to be important for the sequel.
reminds me of HL2
Everypony dies! The end!
Chekhov wishes he had that gun
STRIDERS!
if you know what I mean
it's like they used all their budget on the awful CG doctor
They probably did.
*chuckles*TRATIOR!
I can killem, just get me a grivity gun.
They did. They get $50 and a handful of toothpaste coupons to spend on CGI each episode.
/me starts the hunt
who would have thought she was a traitor. it's not like every single one of them has turned out to be a traitor
That women is a...ahh screw it, that joke is overused.
Let us know how that turns out Cloudrunner
wait earth has radation pits?
Since when?
Sumica PM me it!
since The Master fucket it all up.
Why the fuck would we need those?
So...the Doctor becomes a folk hero?
did we nuke it for fun?
jon, it's the master: why not?
...True,'
"Throw this jacket over her! They'll never know!"
...His fucking voice*giggles
For delicious nuclear fuel, if the Slitheen had any good ideas.
CP'S
13Ah. Well, we've been hiring moderaters for a while now.
I wonder if this is symbolic, eh?
then they break into a spontaneous, yet perfectly coreographed dance number.
13Some of our mods are only weeks into their modship.
the doctor would point his screwdriver at it.
Yeah,
Oh okay.
I love me some heavy handed symbolism.
Symbolism?
I'm not seeing it.
Doctor Who NEEDS an episode with a choreographed dance number.
Doctor Who needs a musical episode like that one in Buffy.
>plans everything out
Test.
>doesn't look in the bag
He does a xanthos gambit
wait
He's crazy, why are you questioning him? xP
no just a normal xanthos plan
what's with the almost Western music?
crazy doesn't automatically mean "dumb" though
Its an exucation.
It supposed to be epic or something?
*sigh*
This is what the Dr would do
YEILD
Time to die martha!
"fleet"
How many total mods are there now? :3
Time to die everyone!
Oh hi fleet.
Except his balls. Those get to live.
This show kind of creeps me out...
So...he gets the villain ball now?
it's not her.
feer the mightly earth fleet of balls and 70's style rockets
no thats the real martha
geez even The Master can't get over Rose. Jeebus.
A gun seriously?thats fucking bullshit
oh boy
Forget Rose already show.
"No, I don't care. I'm gonna shoot you."
Incoming deus ex machina
the power of friendship
"Then the problem's solved."
FRIENDSHIP!
...Ponies.
And this is where the episode lost me.
Friendship is Magic.
Ponies
Ponies!
And this is where it got stupid.
agggggh this is so stupid. Rose became a god, Martha becomes... the Doctor's high priest. fail
OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, THIS CAGE IS TOO SMALL
FRIENDSHIP
that word should have been Ponies
Oh what kindo of care bear BS is this
so yeah...this is complete bullshit.
got stupid? lol
Celestia?
At least season 4 made up for it...
did they just pull a disiny
And 5 xP
03*Yawn* Still pony'ing out eh?
yea
we were foreshadowed vengeful-god-Doctor! y u so bullshit
*takes a shot*
The Master is displeased
Yup, a bit of a BS ending, I'll agree.
Doctor: AH'M JESUS NOW
Denied_Existence: You bet :P
But wait!
I don't get what is happening...
it gets worse!
I believe in fairies!
DAT ANVILISCIOUS AESOP
oh tennant
he is GOD!
Ok
god mode
Think basicaly
really, they went this way
03Oh, hey SB, I see they started up your trial run
Super Saiyan Docgtor
The doctor is a spirit bomb
03Good luck
AHH FUCK
from DBZ
*godmode* *noclip*
USE THE FORCE, DOCTOR
NOOOOO!!!!
who's the master now?.....see what i did there?
IIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT'SSSSSSSSSS OOVER NINE-THOOOOOOOOOOUSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAANDDDDDD
His medoclorian count is EXTRORDIARALY high.
Oh, great, the Doctor is now in Avatar Mode.
hugs
and the power of friendship
Use the stream shutting down.
You see, I totally erased this episode from my mind xP
SAIYAN HUG
WHAT IS THIS THIS TENCHI IN TOKYO BULLSHIT
Holy crap someone remembers Tenchi in Tokyo?
Blackhole sunnn
THe stream is refusing to play the ending
Yeah, the "hug the viallain into defeat" ending ticked me off even then
BLACKHOLE SUN!WON'T YOU COME.
lol balls
this is gonna hurt
RAWRity, if we follow Tenchi logic that would mean the Master/the Doctor becomes canon...
Like i said.it gets worse.
Toclofane, some stay alive, while others feel the pain.
BEST LINE EVARH\
stormtrooper aim
>has the power of a god
"Yeah, that happens to me a lot."
Master/The Dcotor...not sure if want?
>hugs him
to be fair
hi
he did see this coming
tennants just gonna hug him again
so....points for putting blackholes in everything!
BLACKHOLE ALL THE THINGS
PARADOX!
wait
love and tollerance. the doctor has it
DESTORY ALL THE UNIVERSE!
Doctor is the OG brony.
REVERSE ALL THE TIME!
the univers is rejecting this ending.
DEUS ALL THE MACHINA
whats going on
i heard it rejects all the things
oh.,.. kay
Universe: Nope
I'll miss The Master's awesome statue. :(
wow
It never happened
Yay, civalization!
we just suppeermaned this ending.
:D
Why does the literal aircraft carrier still exist?
Yay! Bush is dead!
none of it happend, save for that one thing
Except the President is dead, ass.
And.... what about all the other people who were present at the time? They all cease to exist?
wait how is he dead of the balls are all gone?
^this
DEM EYEBROWS
wait, nvm
is she an oompa loompa?
USE THE DARK SIDE, FRANCINE
SHOOT HIM
doit doit doit doit
they did not think this ending through
i cant quite put my finger on what she looks like
Why does everyone remember it anyway? I mean I can understand people who have traveled on the Tardis...
Oh yeah
he just said "eye of the storm"
youll understand. in time.
13Good question. lol
I don't listen =P
Wow, now that is not a faithful wife.
Nope.avi
13I'm unsure off the top of my head, actually.
Lol.
DEAD.
50?
13No. lol
HAHAHAHA
13Over a dozen.
Sorry, 75?
ALWAYS THE WOMEN
lololol
aww this is cute
And the Slash fangirls went nuts.
because we can't have any plotthreads left over.
I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT!MUST OF BEEN SOMETHING YOU SAID!
:D
Oh I own that same dress as her. Props to that woman's fashion sense.
Okay.
:P
:D
go on
DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIIIIIGGHHT
kiss him
...I DONT WANNA BE ALONE!
This might seem a silly question to ask
/me has woken up again
just makeout already
FFFFF your friendship
don't make us wait til the end of time
I win... because I die... ?
:)
hold me like you did by the lake on naboo!
JUST FUCK ALREADY!
:p
you've created a time paradox
:'(
and then he derped
Hm
...DYINGS GOOD TOO THAT WORKS.
I changed my mind actually.
The ending's not so bad.
Ok...i don't like the reverseing time
:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
no, that climax was pretty bad.
but i do like the doctor being all alone and the funeral.
I found it shallow and pandantic.
I used to think the whole magic rocket power Doctor thing was a bit stupid.
Second to last of his race does kinda perish.
But I'm alright with it.
I thought the whole Doctor Jesus thing was dumb.
no, it's still terrible. Martha got screwed.
I'm fine with this ending.
:D
me too
What's with the burning
It's not the worst ending I've ever seen.
I'm fine with everything after time reverses
why must we always burn things
Timelord's body can't be found.
viking funeral
The magic doctor is the only thing I didn't like, but the ending was good
It reminds me of star wars, Vader's pyre lol
It's not the best ending out of all the episodes, but still really good.
deliopen - yeah me too
and random
oh hey...you can see exactly where the entrance of torchwood is
its the tower fountain.
*Leaves two years later*
Theres Torchwood
was't that a star trek ep?
impossible thing
also a fact
...what
paradox machine.
later captan grabass
I own a very similar coat.
plastic surgery jack
lots of it.
then they just air the Latest Torchwood arc
Oh snap!
oh shi-
Dun dun dun
0_O
yay
WAT A TWEEST
when he gets mortal for a bit
why would anypony want a vocal free episode?
...wait what...thats ...no...bullshit
Yeah, I've decided I'm ok with this episode.
wait wut
What's the twist?
what's this reference to?
I've never caught that
I don't get it...
WHAT THE HELL.
wait... what? i missed that
Jack is the Face of Boe
i wans't payign attention, what was the twist?
fan dubs
the Face of Boe was a character from the last three seasons...
ok
Jack is the face of boe...
thanks
This is the series finale?
You have to watch the older episodes to understand it
Darn, ok.
A giant face that lived million of years
No. This is season 3 finale.
They've stated it's possible that he isn't after all.
home sweet, bigger on the inside home.
This is the 3rd series finale (British shows run in series not seasons)
lol
fucking prank callers.
"Darn stalkers, clogging my phone lines."
Lets not touch 100trillion
"I mean, I know I'm handsome, but still."
:p
FORESHADOWING
...doctor you do that next season
not this one
me too.
but martha, it was all a dream.
it was nice.
That was a good one.
Was there another season after this one?
I like murder mystery stuff.
:'(
Eugh, series 5. >_>
I'll take that as a yes.
dari doesn't like donna?
Who is better Tennent or Smith?
I liked how it was Cluedo, only instead of Colonol Mustard it had The Giant Killer Space Wasp
I said "Eugh, series 5. >_>"
Here's to another season of Doctor What!
"well, off to equestria"
Donna is 4. 5 is Amy.
*troll face*
As in, MAtt Smith.
ohhhh...
I like matt honestly
That fugly terrible actor.
I hate him.
So much.
GOD DAMMIT LEAVE MARTHA
He does have a skullface.
He is pretty beatup looking.
GTFO MARTHA.
Smith is pretty good.
HE'S NOT GONNA GET IT. LEAVE.
I like Smith, he's honestly my favorite of the New Who Doctors.
Smith can't act, and he's fugly.
I hate him.
I wouldn't hook up with matt smtih, thats for sure o.o;
dari can't clop to 11
Bowties are cool, though.
Shes like knives chao.

I think he has a nice face.
:<
Sucks to your bow ties
Bow Ties are cool
O_______O
But fezzes are
DEAL WITH IT
Bow ties are very, very cool.
So you hate him because hes ugly and his name is terrable? That is not a good argument as to why he sucks
"But your Fez is familiar."
Matt Smith = less cool than Hitler
Ok Dariy, enough ranting.
Anyways, g'night.
Matt Smith has a brilliant name. I'm standing by it.
I'd like to see you do better.
Everypony came?
Smith > Tennant :P

Well Plank is a great actor
He could play a fabulous flamingo.

I'd rather see Twilight Sparkle though
Inanimate Carbon Rod for 12th Doctor!
LOVE AND TOLLERATE!
0.b+-kjiuyh78
Did everypony cum?
Forget it people stop reasoning with him, he made his own decision and we should respect it
Twilight Sparkle would make a good Doctor Why.
Tommy Wiseau as the doctor
Sorr, tolerate.
:P
nah I cant see Twi as the 12th
knock my key board of the desk there
I did
Ponies are cool.
Everypony!
what you think about that?
less ranting, more seaponies
I don't mind that Dari hates Smith, I still love him. Plus Dari's rage amuses me.
Did anypony read the fic wtih the Sepia Tock?
5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5v5

The Inbetweeners
This air on the BBC I pressume?
Might be pasttence but yes
…How did you find this chat room?!
Nvm :P
It was on channel 4.
DAT ASS
Not BBC.
BBC 4?
No
Channel 4.
The channel is called Channel 4.
I heard that british television consists of mainly BBC :P
but all british tv is BBC =p
...
Lawl
I FUCKING LOVE COMERCIALS!
Hardly any is.
BBC Ponies
BBC is something like 5 of 1000 channels.
I like the BBC.
Whats the British equivalent of bullshit opinionated news?
They aired the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV Show :D
I dunno, we don't have one?
Aponymous: Lol, they don't need a specific show to bullshit the news.
yes dari but saying it's on 4 would be like me saying turn to 101 for ponies.
Sumica: It's different. :P
The channel is literally CALLED channel 4.
Otherwise how else will we know what happens in the world?
It was one of the first TV channels.
The 4th.
:P
So that's its name.
BS dari
Was this their first show? :P
Lol. No. XD
Man, I wish we had a channel that was just called channel 4, I'm sick of all these stupid channel names.
"576i" LOL
"The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the television licence-funded BBC's two services and the single commercial broadcasting network, ITV."
It was the 4th TV channel.
Its name is channel 4.
Deal with it.
SUDDENLY SLOWMO
"Time to watch BBC!" "Which channel is it on??" "There's only FOUR channels, just flip through them. You'll find it."
Well originally BBC was the only channel I think.
...I like her.
In the future, there will be TWELVE channels on TV.
crazyfrog?
She's cool.
How could there possibly be THAT many different shows to fit those channels?!
and six of them will be Ponies 24/7
why does this guy remind me of nyancat

"I'm not eating that it came out of the fucking sea!" wat
ahahahaha

then it floppled...
Oh God, this show is great.
this show is perfection
name of show again?
The INbetweeners
oh yea
reminds me of that one episode of Gintama
Did SuperBrony64 go to bed?
Yes
i lost it when he punched the fish
ah
is dar italking?
yes ish
okay i thought i heard a very faint version of him first
my ass they werent
Dariy speak up
why don't i believe you dari
Fuck fish, I hate fish.
lol
yeah that fish was definitely harmed
No really.
:p
bah, when I see Dar, I have to think of Dare now?
codswallop.
One of the television announcers said that when I saw the episode air.
lies!
so... the fish had a stunt double?
a dead stunt double?
I suppose.
During the Q&A somepony pronounced Lyra as Lee-ra... who was that?
No idea.
they did? XD
Not me.
Like Leeroy?
they confuse her with Lira?
GGgala they did. Tovler yes.
just watched the New Canterlot DLC trailers. AWESOME!
Wasn't that Ghosties?
I think so
They need correcting
I couldn't tell any of them apart from Dairy because British.
inb4 Your Secret Slut is a guy
Still doesn't compare to my ex pronounced Lucian as Lucky Anne
oh too late
*Aside
What did you think of the Q&A anyway?
I liked it
Silverscreen needs a mike, chat was blurry as fuck
It was funny, I laughed at you guys arguing about milk
It was good. I couldn't hear Hipster very well.
but it was awesome.
was it recorded?
I don't think he spoke much.
it was amusing Dari, for what i could listen to.
Yeah, Hipster didn't say much.
i had no idea how far behind in the questions you were though
my question "What do you most aspire to do before age 60?" was never reached but I didnt expect it to be.
I had a follow-up question to my Orange Soda question and you answered it without me needing to ask it.
I couldn't tell if you were behind or skipping some
I'm just glad DCD told me which of you mods was a SNATCHER.
Kamen Rider was pretty sweet though
Hey, a Run DMC poster!
troll bureaucrat is best bureaucrat
lol
I already forgot who actually clopped to ponies.
that was a Q?
wait wut
i missed that A...

couldnt really tell who said yes because everypony was talking.
it sounded like it was in jest though
my Orange Soda and Cutie Mark question was answered. I was satisfied.
:)
dat snobbery...
lol
Could have just said "I don't wanna work in a garage"
he's got hoof-in-mouth disease so bad
But then he wouldn't get kneck deep in shit. :)

Gar-age
I think so.

Frogspawn are frog's eggs.
Tadpoles are just tadpoles here.

ahh
At least you Brits got SOMETHING right.
CloudRunner, what?
:P
That commercial had a guy in a panda suit running a marathon
Tovler I know that
ohhh, mfw i ignored the ads
Its just a little stupid to run one when wearing a fucking fur suit!
once it's deadly cold, running in a fursuit won't seem absurd.
Not that theres anything wrong with furrys
also yes Tocler
Tovler*
Are they really dancing to that god awful song?

i was considering setting up a stream somewhere
Good choice on Watership Down Dari. :)
for any interested bronies/mundanes
So we are watching some fine ads instead of porn now?
Do clopfics count CloudRunner? We've done live readings of requested fics before.
great.
And requested fics apparently ALWAYS mean clopfics.
I guess not.
Why cant we simply skip this and watch porn?..
so long as I dont have to watch some nasty ass people getting with it
GGgala: to be honest, i have no idea; i was going to look into it after getting out of bed
baby blue DS?
/me 's DS is black
/me 's is red, ujelly?
My N3DS and my president is black

i feel like a fucking piece of toaste with a SHIT TON of JAM on it
and dissapointment
ahahaha. all he talks about is sex. pot, kettle, black
lol wife beater
That always struck me as a horrible name for a shirt.
his mom is suisidal
i really wonder the etymology on that term...
EspyLacopa GGgala ever see a redneck?
That is where the name comes from
That does not invalidate the horridness of that name for the shirt.
/me lives in arkansas
/me has seen it far too much
HA!
wtf
no lock
:D
hahaha
giving himself a stranger
that was awesome
aahaha
yay I go to bed during a stream and wake up during a stream
i hate the lloyds tsb adverts
ha!
ponies make everything better
Man, you Brits have boring ass comercials.
yup
EspyLacopa most people who wear those live up to the name of the shirt. either that or they are normaly douch bags
Lawl, I did an hour stream of some awesome British adverts a while ago.
Sammy Davis Junior the Pony made that one episode of the Boondocks on of the best.
We have some epic adverts. XD
CloudRunner: That /still/ doesn't invalidate the horrid name of the shirt.
I have yet to see them.
"eeeyup" lol
hello
Are they listening to Dido?
sausagefet birthday
*fest
will come today the new episode?
CloudRunner, think Geico. but British
>Quid
I was gonna say prostitutes.
EspyLacopa no it doesnt. It makes it worse. and makes people who do like those shirts asswholes. *cough* my brother *cough*
thats right whole ass
what shirts are we talking about?
wife beaters
I wear wife beatersas an undershirt when I wear a suit. Only excuse to wear them.
you are grim mate
lol
The only reason to wear them
people who wear them as the only shirt they have on are just awful

Speedo?

peedo?
Cheeto?
Greedo?

peedoh is an awful pronounciation
It's correct pronunciation. :P
night everypony!
Show has ruined legos for me. :/
lol
i request star trek
There's no pony emoticon for :\
It's spelt 'paedophile' here, so it makes more sense to pronounce it that way.
but is just sounds so...
also, a rather large sandwich
>pae
>pronounced like pee
how does that make more sense
It does.
lol
i'd expect it to be the other way around
that "ae" letter is in your alphabet?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCywGhHQMEw
technically, yes
without the A you have a much better case for the long E sound
as in 'encyclopædia'
yeah...
which is actually pretty sensible
with the A you make it sound pie 'pie--dophile'
hmmm...
who's hosting the stream?
Hmm.
which is Soarin' territory
ponies?
because whoever you are, you have a sexy voice
dari is who it is
i think we requested fic

I'd better not sleep through Airbender
/me reading bubbles as dari does.
Tovler, best advice: DO slep through it
it's riff tastic Tovler
I want to heckle it roundly
Mood whiplash?
bracing for manly tears
this is adorable so far
I only saw Airbender for the penis hair. I was not disappointed.
HNNNNNNG
TOvler... wat. and go on
The back of the princess head looked like a cock. You won't be able to unsee it.
Your voice is like audial chocolate
Tovler, Yue's? XDDDD
Yue has the haircock?
:'(
This story makes me laugh so hard.
*cough laughs*
...
Drummar is evil
Im sorry :(
you monster
Its just the way they said 'Mommy says derpy is a retard'
its a nice story, it just some of the random bits makes me chuckle
/me not... gonna...
author calling the Derpy derpy.
/me cry...
Aww now im slighty sad
stream keeps stopping working for a second then continuing...
g'day from australia, hihi to all pony folk!
G'day Stripes :)

/me crying now. :'(
No dead ponys... pleease...

/me still sad...
hi Drummar , hi GGgala ..

I suddenly have so much more respect for derpy
I never really liked her
good
you're just in time to have your heart broken, stripes
but i just ofund out the next episode isnt till th 15th :(
Its about to get harder to hold back sadness
why is that GGgala ?
we are reading a Derpy origin fic
Imma post a link at the end. open it when I do and you will cry
/me :'(
/me is so sad
/me ...
The simple writing makes me think that a child is projecting a real-life story onto Derpy
/me holding back....
/me cant...
/me do it....
/me crying
um..ok, then..
i will wait for the link :)
/me knows how this ends

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cvb8KaCmoK0/Tb3hbWOY3uI/AAAAAAAAEBg/6T7eSOtUxvU/s1600/bubbles_completed.png
it's already bad
*hugs a CloudRunner ..* there there. its ok
They abandoned her
Her mom tryed to kill her
and then abandond her
also open my other link
that's how she ended up in ponyville
and i presume she distracted her with the bubbles then abadnoned her
and abused her
yes
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7298408/1/The_Cough
That was sad, not "OMG CRYING MY EYES OUT" sad, but it was sad.

eeyup
it smashed my soul. but I was only crying on the inside
Oh no..

Who is it shipping?
I have a good feeling about this.

SO MUCH SHIP!
handling is where the real 'action' is though.
wut fic is this?
O_O
sto-ic
Does your ship have cannons?
stoicism
nope
lol derailed
Fic derailed by pronunciation issues.
win
stoic
and so we come full circle...
thats where
just go
sto-wick
from Britpicking pronunciation to sadfic to darkfic to pronunciations again
Does this thing ship everypony!?
OH SHIT IT DOES!
Shipping by freight train is best shipping.

Which fic is this?

Hello. :3
i think all the fics after Celesta/door are pretty twisted
Which fic is this? Im hearing talking
/me hands CloudRunner a nerf gun!
what happened to fluttershy? please anser someone
Celestia/Door set the tone rather well.
I dont know... Im still shell shocked from the last one
*Turns up my audio* This guy sounds like he has a light english accent.
stripes sadly that wont help
abandonment, death and rape we are going full circle
one of the most-discussed recent fics. Rarity's Generous Plan
hehe
Did he just say virginities? o.e
great i already heard enough i think
i cant give you anything better CloudRunner ,here in australia no one has real guns!...lol
:D
If ANYPONY sugests "Cupcakes" I will personaly end you.
I hope that this fanfic has nothing to do with...Rape or sexual entercourse.
:D
i will assist you cloudrunner
...
I cant take another death like the last one
>_>
Cause im hearing alot of "Virgin"

I came on here like 3 weeks ago.
Im pretty active on here :P
Just type their name (case sensitive)
I'm here on weekeneds mostly.
somehow I was declared a regular
or enough letters of their name to be unique, than press Tab to complete the name automatically
GGgala just blew my mind
does mlp come 2day?

o.e
/me o_0
Pedo.
What
Thank you for telling me about the tab thing GGgala
Yeah, CloudRunner?
Only he would know.
awww, no prob.
:\
/me hugs CloudRunner back
Why does the applause sound like nosy ass rain? o.e
2 minutes
did you mean to tackle me at 500 miles an hour? XD
If I would have known about that sooner begging dari to stop would have given me less carpal tunnel
heh :3
GGgala: yes actualy. but it was a hug at the same time so...
You learn something new everyday
Hey, What are we gonna do on the 31st? We gotta do something Scary pony releated. Horror movies will be too bland
Halloween episode?
eeh... Cupcakes, anyone?
i think i came to early to the livestream haha XD
NO!
Its just a suggestion.
GabZonY: NO NO NO!
hey GMT'ers check the time
more like SlenderMane, GabZonY
I can gauruntee it wont get out,Lets just go on a pony marathon on the 31st
Not you SploogeTheFish you have a good idea
Oh.
leet oclock
I got two suggestions
If one is Cupcakes you can stop right there
Someone jumped a Double Decker? Boss.
Pony scary storys(Not fanfics) or a pony marathon on the 31st
SploogeTheFish... stories but not fanfics? what... videos?
Im always up for a goo MAREathon
GGgala: good point
lol'
I dont know, Not anybody wants fanfics(Especially rape ones or violent)
SploogeTheFish: I second that
I dont even want those horrid creations
HAHAHAHAHHA
btw who sugested the rape fic?
I want Cupcakes, puns sustain me.
There are a lot of fanfics, bound to be scary ones that aren't like that.
hay Razyn
And ive almost made a fanfic(It was an alteranate story,Nothing to do with those nasty ass ones)
...
Are you a wizard?
ohai razyn
lawl
pointless
You know what these guys need to talk about? Cowadoody.
(A.K.A Call of Cuty)
*Duty*
ohhh
So this is a show about British people talking about whatever? I like it.
i was wondering why you were talking aout cow paties
O.e
So anypony care to help me make heads or tails of mIRC?
*about. *patties
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING?
Scary is ok. Kicking in Fluttershy's head (and failing requiring more kicking) and or raping her is not!
number 2
razyN: sure
Cloudrunner: Very true man, Very true
Coolio
Sad is ok. Hurting Fluttershy is not.
Stephen Fry talking about Language?
Hurting anypony is not
^
awwwww yeah
But especialy Fluttershy
But hurting fluttershy is over the top.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY
I mean she is like me...With the ego of "Do no harm"
Oh, I was so distracted by sexy british people to tell you all "hello".
Not sure if should open link EspyLacopa
I thought it was dead here
Oh well!
which makes it a good place yeah XD
It's Stephen Fry talking about Language.
you can be forgiven Veewave
ok thats good

MICHEAL PALIN
We saw :P
EspyLacopa my Brit Lit. teacher showed that to my class last year
Nice
Hey the EQD banner has changed back to Trixie!
Oh yeah. Wonder how many don't know...
what's the trouble wth mIRC?
EQD with a Trixie banner? WHAT A TWEEST!
That makes me happy because the CNN looking one was pissing me off
just connecting to the server and such
For now
Damnit Aponymous... that was good... ish
In my house, I nearly want to cry looking at my pantry/Freezer.

Oh you guys
My mum asked what was up
I'm gonna watch MLP on my tv, later people.
it was awkward.
cya'
i know that feel bro
i want it to start
lol loyalty card
unfortunatley, my friends know im a brony
when do you think it will start?
Whenever i mention Ponies, they slap me in the balls to get me to shut up -.-
mfw Slendermane
that sux, some friends of me know too
It is supposed to start right now
but I guess it got delayed
ponycountdown.com is back?
only one of my friends is ok with it
Yup
NO NEW EPISODES THIS FRIDAY?
She wants to become a Catholic, BURN HER AT THE STACK
This is bullcrap.
STAKE
but one respect it. he loves memes, altough he doesn't understand this
Im still trying to create my new account hold on
SATERDAY
wiki says the next episode airs oct 15th
Yes it is
lol Edward_Newgate
hmm..
NO!!
but shes a brony (or... filly? Idk XD) And we talk about it alot
I think it's going to be a halloween episodes
I HATE YOU HALLOWEEN
DELAYING MY PONY
The thing is though, you will NEVER understand until you become one
i wish i knew a brony irl
yes xD
Believe me kid, Catholic school is not all its cracked up to be
Damn CloudRunner is taken!
If my friends weren't okay with something so trivial as this, I don't think they would really be my friends anymore.
I WANT MY PONY NOW!
Meh, hub is showing ep1 of season 2 again.
Outnumbered
suddenly ghost dari
SploogeTheFish: That will be a last resort
:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[
ugh... back to bed for me then..
Ok, Splooge is invalid
i know .. but ...
My friend said he saw it on boomerang
there is no episode
What about sotha, CloudRunner?
Gotta choose some others
but i never saw it on there :/
what is this game btw?
what is this?
:(
its like worms
ill check...but i'm from europe, i'm not sure if they air the same
Obama XD
what are we watching?
I know that feel brony
outnumbered
something about british druggs
My name is SploogeThePi
XD I never watch british things like this
We cant just accept this .... We waited for Season 2
very interesting
only ever watch the inbetweeners and top gear
micropigs? hnnnnng
That mom sort of reminds me of DCD's mom, she's so into the kid's personal life
and now ? then we wait 1 week for every episode
top gear is fun :D
it is
and now they want us to wait !2! more weeks?
can't believe i missed DCD's mom shenanigans
I just don't watch tv really...tv licenses are too expensive
It's impossible
We we're patient for like how many moths
monthes*
It was amazing when she barged into his room
I forgot
we need more ponies in england
but they were MANY
we need the hub down here :P
not sure if I should to resort to using an "x" as a space
ponies everywhere...the world will only become a better place
I hat people who do that
we need pony's in holland too
This is like the british version of the middle
Kind of.
But this is much more realistic.
if you ask me, we should have one world wide tv service
She looks a lot like Emma Watson
things would be SO much easier
yes indeed
The middle seems at lot more sitcom staged.
The Middle?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/10/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-scumbag-hub-gimme-my-ponies/
everyone could watch pony's(and anime)
god no...with the amount of commercial breaks in the states? it'd drive me mad...the ones in england are bad enough
But the middle has the janitor from Scrubs, which makes it awesome
english ones arent to bad if you ask me
well now i have to see The Middle
Meh, not a fan of scrubs.
Time .. for a revolution
^
they aren't too bad aye...but they still annoy the heck outta me :P
Unbelievable
lol, catholics need to drink alcohol.
ever seen a japanese comercial?
Zach Braff is great actor
How can you not be a fan of scrubs, there is so much originality in it.
nope
Cause some things are just worth fighting for !
Yep XD
there....weird
*Loads shotgun* Quite!
Catholics also need to pretend puny little wafers are 'bread'
I just don't find it funny so much as annoying.
wait yes
SPONGEBOBBLE!
i remember the puddi commercial
like the once with spongebob happy meal....YOU READ MY MIND
SploogeTheFish: went with CloudxRunner
:D
I also find it annoying that it's so vastly overrated by the majority of my peers.
herdmind >.>
and that the wine literally becomes Jesus's blood
and I hate myself for it
Ok, Cloud im SploogeThePi
Y U NO START?
and that it's literally Jesus at that
Just like the way I see RainbowDash
quite literally
Eh. . . Well, I think I'll just go back to sleep. I was hoping BMN would still be streaming the repeat episodes.
/me is loading
GGgala:inorite
/me is taking forever
nope.avi
This is what it feels like right now=> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv3Q1Y-raYM&feature=related
i dont think that anyone are streming them
But, i know a YT Guy who has the episodes us
Veewave, OMNOMNOM cannibalism
Just YT RednaxelaMLP
TOO IMPATIENT
i'm going to make some homework
lol
Dari, if I were a streamer, I'd stream Scrubs a lot, then you would come to see it for the great show it is
Suddenly. Raise your hand if you have a PSN account (not related to anything anypony was saying)
I just can't believe it. Alot of bronies already have made popcorn
/me raises hand
MFW I'm a streamer and should stream Scrubs
and took care of the snacks
I've seen a fair number of episodes Edward_Newgate.
and went to the bathroom
I'm just not that keen on it.
bye everyone
to find SECRET BUTT FUN
instead of the usual pony
Scrubs and Frasier.
CloudRunner: I do but I don't use it anymore because CFW.
GGgala yes you should
CFW?
and both versions of The Office
Custom FirmWare
Cloud,We got a game running
ciao
take are fellow brony
OOOHHHH
Cupcake and me are waiting for ya
*Brohoof*
that wouldnt be good
CFW? awesome
... i just dont want to believe
SploogeTheFish: makeing char one sec
Who has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso
WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
So...MLP isn't on again? I thought it showed twice in a row :/
ummm whats this?
some bbc thing
when will mlp begin?
MLP is a repeat this week, so we didn't stream it at all
never
Ohh okay then. Thanks
huh?
repeat today. new ep's in two weeks
Cloud?
WHAT
umm
no new ep today?
why did it kick me?
Nope.avi
need new inv
damnit
was so exhited
so, next week, a new ep will come?
noooooooooooooo
did i misss it?
not tilll the 15th
miss what?
episode 3 isn't till Oct 15
:O:O:O:O
thx
np
so, next week, will it be a new ep?
week after...
why must it take so long?
because TV networks
-.-
sucks
eeyup
for now, we have britcoms
i mean, with the two first ep, the second ep came the week after
ikr.
GGgala: dude you didnt move
so why is tv not wanna give next ep untill in 2 weeks?
I DEMAND MLP EP 3 OF SEASON 2 NOW
game only just appeard to me CloudRunner u_u
what the hell is thisssssssss D=
WHO'S WITH ME
damn son. I feel bad for you
Hello
we must infiltrate Hasbro HQ
why?
Hello
where's my little pony?
if we want ep 3 now :p
they are not gonna send in in 2 weeks
Oh, why do you say that?
that's why we must go to haspro, and demand that we get to see it now
:o
They have ep. 4 planned for Oct 22, one week after Oct. 15
where's my little pony? :(
Why would they air Ep 4 before Ep 3?
who knows
It's a rerun
O.O
Btw, Ep 4 is a halloween episode
hehe
Ponygeist?
It will feature Princess Luna
D:!!!!!!!!!
YES
^^
We also have a name for their Halloween
LUNA LUNA LUNA LUNA
Nightmare Night
oh ho
huh? you just said ep 3 is on the 15th anyway
just hope luna don't turn into nightmare moon again
According to the Synopsis, she's trying to change her public image
why would she not
seeing that, she was nighmare moon
many hate her
tho they showed her being friendly in ep 2 of season 1
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A_Xj7mp28XY/Tobgfn4wGqI/AAAAAAAANC0/1d-0jnfK74E/s1600/DAGJh.jpg <-- O.o
Today and Next Saturday are reruns
The 29th of October will also have a rerun
The Halloween episode will be rerun on the 29th
http://bc-programming.com/images/other/mlp/wallpaper/fullres/showimages/luna.png <-- Sweet
after its premiere on the 22
True, but if you think about it, it wasn't that much longer that she returned to Canterlot and was never seen again, so no one got to know the real her
Ooo, epic luna wallpaper.
It was only natural that they continued Nightmare Night, which no doubt started 1000 years ago
when Nightmare Moon was first banished
Whether or not that theory is true will be revealed on the 22
And no EI standard to fuss up the scary-ness.
Halloween stuff is supposed to be scary
It is, after all, the Day of the Dead in Mexico
Oh, be fair, the Day of the Dead isn't about being scary, it's about respecting the dead.
ok
well, hope there will be mlp next week, so till then
Day of the Dead is just fun
i'm saying good bye, being 20% cooler ^^
cya
Did I miss anything?
I can't wait until the 15th
i just bought the new jonathan coulton album!
Episode 3 will air then
Synopses aren't exactly spoilers, are they?
dunno
Ask mods
hey Wrek
think they're afk
/me dumps a bucket of water on the mods.
lol
Hmmm. I needs to move around my desktop icons now so that they aren't covering up Luna.
Boingy boingy boingy!
YES!!
just customising my char
lol
Just type something like @pony and he will answer
No, it was an obvious entry into "magic" spam
Yay, gloriously black Luna background achieved.
yay!
*inhales deeply* yay
no more Outnumbered then?
Now I just need a good black Luna-based chrome theme. . .
Did you know that the sound of Fluutershy's deep inhale in "Sonic Rainboom" was simply Pinkie Pie's gasp from episode 1 played backward?
yes
...Of all the ponies, why does Pinkie Pie have a black Chrome theme?
dunno
I do biology with a guitar
huh?
How do you do that?
The kid on the stream was "doing" Biology homework with a guitar.
this scene shows why its called outnumbered
Headline for pathfinder newsletter: "LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!"
Red godzilla?
EspyLacopa: Possibly for aesthetics
Pink on black works really well
I am dieing from lag.
Yea, probably why Emoshy works as well as she does.
*Lag and skips.
But it's /Pinkie Pie/
Her and black.

As I said, you need to take this up with the other mods anyway, I'd talk to Ghosties in partiuclar, I think he's most likely to object.
So, when will the Stream resume?
Stream will resume when I get back, so sometime before 7pm GMT.
It's just a bot
Or 2pm EST.
ok
Val would object vehemently as well
Yeah, I'm not sure how they'll feel about that FlutterBro13.
It's mostly for not here
Only on non-stream days
Well as I said, you'll have to take it up with other mods.
But Dari is best mod

I'm not much into carbonated beverages these days
Agreed
I mostly just drink water
i dont drink water unless its flavoured for some reason
Though I've always wanted to try Crystal Pepsi for curiosity's sake
same
06Crystal Pepsi. . .?
yep
from the 80's
heard of the name...
clear pepsi
R.I.P. Crystal Pepsi
It's from the 90's
oh, right
sorry, I get mixed up @_@
Transparent cola, I've read that it's more sweet than Pepsi
Crystal Gravy = much better idea
afk
They stopped making it when I was around five or so, so I never had a chance to try it
and I'm back
Mmm…invisible cola...
They make invisible soda?
well, not really invisible
more like... clear
and not anymore
Well
There's still a brand of transparent cola, but uhh
Bah, that's not invisible.
EspyLacopa: They did, it was called Crystal Pepsi
illegal in nine states, killed fifty people?
oh
CLEAR IS SYNONYMOUS WITH INVISIBLE!
not really

/me pats ValtheJean on the back
Welcome RAWRity!

just a bit
so, about 5 mins til the worst movie adaptation since DBZ Evolution.
/me cries after reading CriticKitten's post
RAWRity: Eeyup

Thanks for the hug CriticKitten
Wowowowow dari's movie is The Last Airbender?

Babes in Toyland was very misleading...
Dunno if it's worse than Babes in Toyland, but it's pretty damn awful

lol
NO! FlutterBro13
The four nations once lived in peace and harmony
FlutterBro13: No Bots, please.
It's a Cartoon that uses the concept of Animes.
Considering japanese cartoons were inspired by Disney. . .
until the elements of harmony were stolen!
wtf... this reenactment of the opening sequence is terrible
/me should really change his nick to Discord
But all of that changed when the Fire Nation attacked
I WANNA GO TO FUSHICON! [/applebloom]
And that's the only good part of the movie
GGgala: This is only the start
anyway, movie tiem

Water, Earth, and Air weren't nations though. . .

I think
I dont like how Katara looks in this
It will never come in here again
ahhhvatar
then discord
ARVATAR?
Water Tribes
Ewwwwwwwww
2,14 Silver: I'm still waiting for the "best" part of the movie. The "epic" fight scene with the earth tribe ;)
Wow, they couldn't even pronounce Avatar right. XD
For some reason shes white in this movie
Earth Kingdom
Air Nomads
Does this version of Katara have a fascination with hope and crying?
Avatar? Isn't that the movie about the blue natives or something?
AUHvatar
oh god, Val
That scene
07,01Actually Discord would fit you :)
Terrible intro is terrible.
ValtheJean: y u do dis
AND THATS HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
Hear that guys, THE AHHHHVATAHHHHHR
I think yes Espy
What the shit cocks is this?
Ahvatar Prince Dahri
lol the only book movie that will be made
...Is Toph a huge burly guy who shouts at people?
2,14 is so wonderful, right? :P
That's more like a deleted scene from You Got Served
Yes, they mispronounced Avatar. Another sign of the horror yet to come: they can't pronounce the lead character's name or title
The Avatar, master of all four elements, and kept balance in the world. But one day, he dissappeared
Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Air Nomads, Fire Nation
Book? I thought we were watching a movie.
no toph
songopaul: god I hope not
2,14 CHEESECAKE
Not Tov?
hey any excuse
fail
Toph
Toph
Ignore the movie and watch the cartoon
Hey look, it's Anakin Skywalker
Toph is supposed to be on the second movie
I think shes sorry
at least toph was spared from this awfulness
SMACK THE BITCH
hey guys, she's sorry
if it exists
Cartoon is much better
And before you ask, YES THEY ARE MAKING THE SECOND BOOK
i dont think shes sorry
and instantly dry
Suddenly, they're white
How can she lose that much water and still maintain an orb that large?
disregard movie, aquire cartoon
OH F-
All will be forgiven if they cast Toph as a huge burly guy who shouts at people to see.
NOOOOOOOooooooooo~!
he always gets... WET
lol
this isn't the sakka I remember : <.....
ive never seen the cartoon
silverscreen they are? I heard that got axed.
He gets...MOIST
2,14 oh I love cheesecake....y I maek meself hungey?
eskimos?
My brother and I found the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great he still has a lot to learn,
You should try it some time
Get used to the voiceovers, y'all.
Ain't no sequel gonna happen
go watch it nao
god y so choppy
Moist is a fantastic word!
I demand a reboot
Roxsnow25: You mean Soaka
i like voiceovers
I dont like how Kataras face looks
They won't ever stop.
This Sokka needs more cactus juice
and he is still the first to get laid ;/
The Ember Island Players was my favourite episode
i heard something about someone named toph though
But I believe that Aang can save the world.
Isnt it Sokka?

CACTUS JUICE!
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DAAAAA DA DAAAAAAAA!!!
Leapord seals are cute

Cactus Juice is delicious.

>cracks ice
Wtf boomerang?
Great idea.
Whoa. They actually kept Sokka's boomerang?
SSSMART
At least this will no longer be the most recent part of the franchise once Legend of Korra comes out.
I AM AC-TING
Yup. That's why I like this room.
Water is alive!
Move away from the crack, M. Night
What happened to beating stick with ball on it?
Best spoken name is Zhao's I believe
KORRA WILL BE FUCKING EPIC

Though usually there's a dozen or so people here so there's one or 2 conversations going on

UNCLE LOOK
oh god...
UNCLE, LOOK, BAD DUBBING
Zhuko
and by god his scar is nearly unseeable
That is so out of context
I know, the scar isn't a scar
The creators of Avatar never disowned this picture.
lol RAWRity
wheeeeeee!!
....Why is Appa's saddle there already?
it's more of a scratch
Silverscreen, seriously? That's why the pronunciations are screwy?
wow this movie is terrible
Why would they? It's such a masterpiece
Because
OH SHIT ITS RED RIDINH OOD
The bison is the best part of this movie.....I can't believe I just typed that
SilvasRuin: eeyup
AND THIS KID NEVER SMILES!
It's The Village!
Mfw all of the bad guys are...
Suddenly, crappy fancy tattoos,
HE'S AANG!
GREAT ACTOR
Aang. White. haha, no.
HE'S A BOMB
WANG i mean AANG

HE SHOULD LAUGH!
It's Uung

My name is Aang, but I'm going to pronounce it as Ahng for this film. :D
"He's exhausted"...he's frozen.....
I'm not sure Rifftrax can save this
They couldn't even get Appa to look right.
LAWL
OMNOMNOMNOM
Where's the Appa sneeze?
:D
no, just very light shade of yellow Silverscreen
only like 10 mins in and it's already meh
IT'S TRYING TO EAT MEH
My god. People warned me about the acting but good god man! It's like they're doing it on purpose!
giant flying raccoon...
Hey
Nice cuts
Hell, tehy couldn't even get Sokka's But Monkey Status right.
Do you want to go penguin sleding with me?

If Rifftrax can save Twilight, it can save anything

....
lol nubs firefags r here
oki!~ Thanks!
....
Flutterz: > Implying that a series based on people having the ability to control the elements and can interract with spirits is going to be realistic
I guess I'll do some trivia for this movie
Comets have a metal core sometimes, are covered in ice, have a cloud of particles around them, get superheated when facing the sun. They have all the elements.
what the heck happened to the comedy >> ?
I might just hit mute, minimize the video and just chat
TRIVIA: The film was originally titled "Avatar: The Last Airbender", after the TV show it was based on. However, James Cameron and 20th Century Fox had already registered the film title Avatar, so the word was dropped from the title to avoid confusion.
What amchines?
MACHINES!!!!
Watchin da bad movie, huhh?
...This isn't nearly as awesome a Fire Nation intro as the cartoon.
Spears? Since when?
07,01i'm looking forward to the new pony eps!
sookah?
exposition
Silverscreen: >implying that fantasy = no logic whatsoever
Shamalon wanted the nations to represent actual nations of the world, setting each nation to be a different race.
bwa ha ha ha
sookah
....Where's Zuko's scar?
Oh yeah
OZAI!
James Cameron's Avatar was a pretty good movie :)
WTF happened to Sokka
I'm so emo it's hurting me
ALL THE ELDERELY!
this movie hurts already
lolwut
ALL YOUR ELDERLY ARE BELONG TO US!!!!
oh, okay, I was wondering wtf was going on here
Why the elderly?
HE LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING TURK
ALL THE OLD PEOPLE
thnks zuko, you cleared things up for me
bring me ALL the elderly!
Flutterz: When it comes to anime and western animation, no, there's no logic. :P
2,14 the prince just likes his elders ;)
THIS IS MY FETISH OLD PEOPLE
THIS MOVIE MAKES ME WRITE IN ALL CAPS
Dat Fire Nation nationality
Wait, Sokka's gone emo? Oh no, he gave up MEAT!
So am I. Wish they would air sooner
just wait till he shouts "jihad" and explodes
Bring ALL the old people?
inb4attemptedlolz
dumb kitara doing stupids again
Sokka, how could you? T.T
They are going to send their elderly off on rafts to die
mines laging bad
ValtheJean: He seduces them out of their fortunes by showing them pleasures they've never known?
kitara = derpy?
I WANT MY COMIC RELIED OR BADASS SOKKA BACK!!!
LOL TAT!

RED RIDING HOOD
Mines runnign mostly fine
UTINI
07,01I thought S2 was ready...
OI
I'm sorry.... but this movie is too bad to watch. See ya when the next movie starts
Grow hair
> No epic fight
Aang is so... short!
He got captured very fast
RAWRity: <3
dat ink
Silverscreen, but people of the fire nation can't control water therefore there is some logic
Zuko dont like the kid
hands of the boy, osama
im good too
07,01it will get worse..I heard...
fucking pedo
kill him
I'M YELLING TO MAKE MYSELF LOOK THREATENING

SUDDENLY, HE IS TINY IS TINY
Y u so mad?
MUST EAT SCREEN
Dev Patel needs moar good movies >_<
Aang: "I need an adult!"
Yeah it gets worse!
Village is ice
Flutterz: > taking this way too seriously. :P
I AM AN ADULT!
WHERE IS HIS SCAR
Hey, you guys know who was originally set up to play Zuko?
Sure lets burn the igloos
well that was easy
Also, What's up #bronystate?
mfw this move :|
The acting is even worse than I heard. How is this possible?
RAWRity: Who?
The melted ice puts out the fire
"We should take this movie, and stream it somewhere else!"
/me hugs Lagmobile
"Melt dowm the village."
Sup!
CriticKitten: because thats exactly how you sound threatening
Ugh needing fire...
This movie is moving quick
Flutterz: Lol.
Put out yo fires, kick der ass
ya
so now I am dubbing these guys names
kitara = derpy hooves
This is so terrible on so many levels. It's like an esher painting of suck.
Silverscreen, I'm just pissed that something they call a comet isn't a comet whatsoever :P
aang = spike
I saw... it does get worse
Slow down movie
Damn it will HURT
This movie is so bad that Not Even Doom Music can save it
caause he's little
Sakka = Twilight
lol CriticKitten
Details, details. :P
Aaaand just like that I have to go...
2,14 I'd rather it go fast...that means it's over fast :P
sky bison
This is the point where I turned this movie off.
RAWRity Zuko was lighter than this in the show...
RAWRity: Oh Celestia why
AND WHEN DID THE WOOKIES JOIN IN THIS FILM!
07,01why did you pick this again? :)
See ya later #bronystate!
dat cgi
whyyyyyy
WHY DOES THE FIRE NATION WIN? THEY NEED EXISTING FIRE! NOONE CAN BE THAT DUMB AND SIMPLY LEAVE THEIR FIRES BURNING WHEN THE FIREBENDERS ATTACK!!!
when they couldn't even get fucking Appa to look right.
Good point Val
This movie is like Dragonball Evolution
oh wait it's only discord
07,01later Lag!
Wait, where was he when the soldiers came in?
Actually from one of the interviews on WQD, someone said the season was only half done when episode 1 was shown.
what the fu.....
THE FUCK
bye Lagmobile
dat grip
lolwut
lol how do the fire nation guys miss a sky bison
What happened to Sokka being awesome? Whyyyyyyyy?!
gah even Apa looks WRONH
So I guess they needed a bit more time
OMFG Is wrong with Appa
At least they got Dee Bradly Baker
07,01oh my..
How can they act this badly and not do it on purpose? Did they drug these people before they went on?
skybison ftw
07,01same with my game...!
is that Iroh?
this and the whole movie in general was when me and my friends were criticizing it out lound in the movies, causing negative reactions from the rest of the viewers :P
skybison = Discord
07,01I was soooo looking forward to it!
EQD*
>put movie on 2x speed
The entire main cast got a racelift. It actually started a movement, called Racebending, who try and stop this like this
Eeroh is so thin
/me brusts into tears
...Iroh doesn't look fat enough.
screw gravity :D
2,14 hey, I think my warning on the newsletter was perfectly fair :P
>it ends in half the time
yes Iroh
>epic win
There on a drug call FAILING
this movie is so many levels of suck
a little test, eh?
"test"
Iroh has dreadlocks

Eeyup

AHAHAHA

SHE'S A BENDER!
Dari, we get it
/me sad that Shamylan didnt actualy watch the show
I GET IT!
Quickly, To the north pole!
Dat foreshadowing
No effort at all in trying to make sure the actors know their own characters' names. Hmm...
only the adults are good acting
I love the cartoon too much for this!
delicious british innuendo XD
Good grief. This movie is literally uncomfortable to watch.
DEM SICK TATS
air bending, eh?
>implying they'll have more than one film
EXPOSITION!
notice how this is the ONLY WHITE FAMILY in the entire south pole?
GASP
Eeroh? Ahng? Arvatar?
Hey look, it's Aunt May.

Dwarf14: it's the combination of all the terrible things
Bendception
Is it bad that I missed ~15 minutes of the start and feel like gouging my eyes out?
I am a Benderbender
I'm going to explain the plot in this long exposition so that you know what's going on.

No, he wont' change hearts, he'll beat the shit out of the firelord!
im no longer lagging
It never happened.
at least Gran-Gran isn't terrible
FROM TAKING OVER TEH WORLD
The camera shots are terrible, the plot building, the characterization, the acting, the pacing, the casting, the action, on and on goes a long list of terrible things.
Mine skeeps pausing
OOH, LOOK AT THE FLAME.
NOT SOMETHING WITH SPIRITS
No but her lines aren't even close
07,01hey everyone :)
Gotta admit, this test ting isn't so bad.
Avatar is Wind Moses....
07,01how was your day?
He lights candles with his mind.
thats what happens when it lags
aww clean that up
yyyeaaaah
Madame Exposition
/me covers crotch so nopony knows this movie has taken my gender away... WAIT SHIT!
Wait, are the fire nation soldiers helping Aang become a more complete Avatar?
little TOM!
the test makes no sense. Is it something unconcious? If so, shouldn't water and rocks shift around Aang all the time?
DANCING ROCK!
Iroh looks like a douche
THEY ARE SPIRIT ROCKS
I dont remeber any of this from the anime
Aang knows the force!!
SPIRIT ROCK
Dumb rock.
Zuko acts like a wooden douce
got some major lag
YAY! there is a cameo from TOM! even if it's his little bro
IT'S A POTATO
If it's not unconcious, then that means Aang's just showing off. He can't be that dumb, right?
Me neither
douch*
07,01no lag here
douche*
Problem, Aang?
POTATOBENDING
That test makes no sense!
Spirit Rock sounds like an awesome musical genre
I dont recall that in the cartoon
who's the guy with the dreads
this film is so bad, I can't even spell right, anymore.
HERE COMES LITTLE TOM!
Wow, that's some great coreography right there.
frickin m night shamalan
IROH IS DREADLOCK GUY
nope
Wat to just let him go, numbnuts
should i just turn this off and go find the anime version?
Don't try to escape! *he tries to escape*
gogog
lol its not trying if you know you can do it
Do a little dance!
YOU BEST BE FUCKING KIDDING ME
It's laging like a lagomorph here
I t would be less pa9nful
UNNEEDED WALL RUN
Stream is dying :(
It's just too laggy to watch.
KID SMILE A LITTLE, WOULD YA!
....When is Aang going to do his awesome stuff and escape while treating this all like a game?
was the wallrunning necessary?
lagg
but not as fun
Lets do it. lets dance, lets dance across the floor

what the hell happened to the 'pick four items out of a hundred' test?
oh upping the memory usage worked
True
woops
ooh kite
CloudRunner: They're a pain to perform, though
Appa's taking voice lessons from Chewbacca....
07,01you now have +o in Pinkie_pie
Aang is more sober than an AA meeting in this thing.
2,14 okie doki loki
I'm really enjoying all these scene cuts...
EspyLacopa: > Implying they get Aang's Character right at all
what about you, Luna?
So why wasn;t his room guarded?
TRIVIA: James Cameron spoke out against the film's last minute conversion to 3D, as he strongly believes films should be shot with 3D cameras, rather then be converted.
Music must be coming out of his ass
> sees glider
how did your "date" go? :P
Flaria: I know from experience.
2,14 many thanks woona
> don't move, you have nowhere to run
could you PLEASE fix the stream?
07,01my date was wonderful
:( Lagfest
lolz this movie is bad
07,01thanks!
Ohai all
Date!?
Why didn't he Bend the fire right next to ang when he said don't move?
07,01I pretty much slept the entire day
mfw everyone is lagging exept me
Hope you are spending a good tiem
You guys WANT to see this?
/me brohoofs fellow traceur CloudRunner
Trivia: James Cameron is the reason this movie doesn't have "Avatar" in the title.
Well, glad that discussion lasted so long.
I am getting some horrible lag here
they should switch the sky bison for rainbow dash
awesome :)
is Aang's voice actor actually trying to sound deeper?
There's no stream lag, if you're lagging it's a problem local to you.
SHOW NOT TELL
the movie would be 20% cooler
Avatar: the last LAGbender
Ungh
PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO SEE TRAINWRECKS, SHUT UP
It isn't called "Avatar" because that title was used by a much better movie :3
Either your internet, or your computer.
Espylacopa, it's coming. and it's terrible.
Auuungh
Flaria woo! Im not the only person who knows that word!
yes, with her bed :P
Now we're at the Air Temple?
yeah
exactly how much exposition is going to be in this movie?
Why are the good guys white and the bad guys every other race that isn't white?
what the hell, where the hell is the smiling >>? these people need to lighten up alittle?
GGgala: That's what the actual priests used. Iroh and Zuko are not priests, so they went with crappy test.
Wow. Those quotes
okie dokie lokie
There is no stream lag, these are not the ponies you are looking for...
THis is the best clip show ever.
Grundle: I'd be pissed by that statement if it wasn't so true
a nice test that makes sense
lol they all dead
:3
ohai Flaria
CloudRunner: Yay~
Ahng
haha ther all dead
Is Katara about to sob?
/me huggles Dermathil
MOMO
Iroh and Zuko never tested him
it's like watching the abridged version
Momo
they just knew
They're JUST learning his name?
lolwut
He's not that bad
th monks named me Ungh
ONLY NOT FUNNY
ahhh ng
Grundle it doesn't use it because Cameron thougt they were trying to copy him. Even thouth the show was around way back in '03
Sorry I can't be here for the movies right now guys, I'm a little busy today.
songopaul: Abridged is better.
MOMO?! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?!
SuperBannana: You don't want to actually watch this anyway.
So much the lag
Cameron even threatened to Sue
Probel in fillydelphia?
Omg. It is zoboomafoo.
Momo doesn't look that bad.
DEDZ!!!1!1
Problem*
After flying MILES they're JUST learning his name?
Monk: "Your name shall be"-UUUNNNGH *dies*
I have..... to talk to you!
uhng sounds like how a sealion calls
I remember this from the anime
>100 years
someone is on a killing spree...
Uuhn
why are is tatoos looking like dirt
But wait
Watching this is like watching a badly made abridged series.
Uuhng*
finally some accuarcy
You've been in ice for 100 years, and I figured this out using little to no information.
INB4 AVATAR MODE
Look at the bird and people die
Where did you get that information lady
this movie has too many little children
I just lost what the hell they were doing just by alt+tabbing away...
WOw...
everywhere people die
seriously
Where the skulls really necessary?
everywhere people die
oscar moment
that bone was so fake
Didn't they say he was upset about something in the South Pole?
Herdmind, Flaria
Ohey! Skulls!
The movie is being accurate? We must fix that!
oh boy... what will the avatar state look like here
I assume they meant this type deal
hehe their dead
I mean that literally
our internnenets dont like us
how bad is it
Ungh gets depressed and people die
well the skulls were in the anime too i think
/me brohoofs CriticKitten
crazy time
The cartoon didn't need them though
everywhere people die
It better have shiny glowing tattoos.
So why are they going on about this now?
/me brohoofs Flaria
Oh
Okay
....did they died?
It does
You see the ruins and you figure it out
right thats it
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm not one to pull a race card
And hovering and tornados and DOOM!

Overly dramatic music is overly dramatic.

Crappy glowing ensues
But why the fuck is Monk Giatso black?

OH SHIT ITS RAIDEN
They dead. D:
confound this lag
It jsut looks weird.
Seeya later, LordCelestia
Racebending at its best
suddenly, float
I think it assumes we're stupid and will need everything explained.
...
silverscreen because they're fine with giving ethnic people roles as long as they don't talk
what is this?
Ohai Twilight
There's not enough emotion on his face.
no, kid
Dude I an SO high
take the ring off
this should have been cool
Skeletons! You know for kids!
Suddenly, shroom-induced delusion
random spirt word?
And this. WHY did they not include Roku?
TRIVIA: Although this movie does not take place in Philadelphia, (like all of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies) some of the movie was shot there.
I don't think this happened
Damn. I can't make fun of the movie if I can't watch it!
RAWRity: I wouldn't mind it, but Giatso is the last character I'd considered to be gender bend with it working.
it's hard to listen when it's all laggy
Or it might have
WHERE IS ROKU?!
er
racialbend
Avi? Like Tavi without the cool "T" at the start?
07,01I don't have any lag at all...
shyamalan? SHYAMALAN?
...
wow
It did
THIS GUY?
me either
FOR REAL?
so I'll just get the jist from watching it muted
HOPEBENDING
rather than actual SHOW the avatar state
UNGH!
Its been awhile since I saw the show
There is no lag, if you have lag, it is due to your own connection.
THEY GAVE AVATAR TO SHYMALAN?
wait what? I don't recall that guy from the show.
no lag.
He went into the avatar state when he found the skeleton of monk Gyatso
I'm lazy, so insert your own Ultima joke
Hey LordCelestia
07,01I do now
I know
Yep, Dark_Horst
They show the spirit world with a bunch of fog and blue lighting
Welcome, SirSprinkles
streamed paused?
Even if Shyamalan didn't watch the series, Why didn't the actors at least watch it?
there's NOT enough emotion in this film
my connection is terrrible
yea epic stopage here
Yeah then Katara hugged him and he clamed down, right?
and when it is there it's badly used
in fact, bbl
I had lag but then i paused unpaused the stream and the lag disappeared. now its back again
Lashing out in anger and grief basically
same
yeah
Welcome back, Pinkamena
seeyas
its back
That was such a touching scene
lol dari, it freezed just as you said that
bye songopaul
my gosh its laggy as hell
Oh, and btw for those who've never seen this movie: it gets even worse
6Fawk. Internets.

Aw. she didn't hug him here
And again when he lost Appa in the desert
yes
far worse
...
HERE comes the lag
LOOK. IT'S AASIF MAHNDVI
oh goodie!
look, indian dude
god
Zuko and Iroh and Gran-Gran are like the only emoting ones so far
no, that isn't...
CriticKitten is right. The high point of this movie was the title
MFW fire benders need fire to bend first.
This movie is devoid of emotion. No love or romance here.
ZHAO!!
Fire Nation peoples don't have enough red.
OH FUCK IT IS
INDIAN DUDES, INDIAN DUDES EVERYWHERE
IT IS. THAT'S ZHAO
Laggity-lag-lag.....
next week they should play the anime version
And my connection is top notch. Can't be on my end
benders gonna bend
so i dont have to find it
indians, turks, irakiis
Fire Nation is so slow because they banned the color Red.
soft pansy
I'm being a dick and revealing the background plot all in one scene!
THAT'S your asian empire today
This just makes me wanna go watch a marathon of the anime
Zuko is too angry (never though I'd say that)
LET'S TAKE THE WHITEST RACE IN THE SHOW, AND MAKE THEM ALL ETHNIC
lol
THE ONLY CHARACTER WITH THE NAME PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY
Lonewanderer, you and me both
Agreed......
WAT?
DID I MENTION I'M THE VILLAIN
IM ACTING
I'm watching the stream myself. I'm not getting any lag.
is that that guy from the daily show?
same
FROZEN
...
Look at the fire nation people: Black everywhere! Where's the wonderful Red?
God forbid that we explain the plot or show flashbacks! Oh no, I must speak out loud and explain it in exposition!
WHAT THE FUCK?!
MY DADDY CAN BEAT YOU UP!
No duel?!

Prince Ali Ababwa
anyone here seen the Rifftrax of this?
he punched so hard the stream froze
6Hey.
he needs to join the Kamen Riders
Hello, I'm that Indian guy from the Daily Show, and I'll be your villain for today's movie.
just as he got kicked in the nuts
Uhm...he's suppose to practice FIREBENDING, not beating the shit out of people.
This movie would be better if it was about magical polychrome unicorns
6Sorry I'm late, it's a long story.
AT LEAST THEY GOT THE TEA PART RIGHT
PRINCE ALI FABULOUS HE ALI ABABWA
>closes movie. "TOO LAGGY. CAN'T SEE SHIT."
The movie jumps around a lot
07,01no worries
THAT BETTER BE GINSENG TEA!
Oh I remember this part
07,01we're pretty much spreaded atm
STRONG AS 10 REGULAR MEN DEFINETLY
As I've said.
anyone else lagging badly?
Why not Jasmin?
If you have lag, it's your own connection.
Ahvatar
Silverscreen: no, its dragon lotus
Yes
6Also, lagging like a mo.
yeah
07,01no lag here...
NO SIR
Oh god, we're coming up on quite possibly the worst scene in the movie...
TF?
Dat freeze then skip!
no its Earl Grey
07,01oh there is now
the FUCK
Yep
i had the last 3 streams lagfree
Very badly.
lolfreeze
No, it'
2,14 eh I'm not sure if the "it's your internet" claim is valid
CloudRunner: But Ginseng is Uncle's favorite.
this a aint my internets, buddy
s Green
UHNG
Avatar was totally fantasy, a weird fantastical world, yet at the same time completely believable because it had consistent rules, that were logical and made sense.
2,14 considering everyone is getting it
Boy or girl?
I've gotten DCD quality streams without lag.
Better yet, it's coffee
Here you have things like "why don't they just put out the fires?"
Oh god, this upcoming scene.
HARU, WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU!
I remember theres a very illogical part coming up in the movie
here it comes guys. The absolute LOW POINT of a movie of nothing but LOW POINTS.
who the fuck is the little one with the hair?
07,01treees hurt?
Is....the most obnoxious insulting scene in the movie
the MLP movie had more care and effort put into it than this
poor pansy
ow
Is VLC still working?
it hurt
and it had better pacing
oh my god, their attempt at humr
poor you
that little kids? that's meant to be Haru
...
I SAID I FORBID IT!
this had care put in to it
and...
no shit
just be a MAD man
HE'S NOT VERY VERY GOOD LOOKING
by**
shamylan strikes again
I thnink it's the player that messing with things
That that is haru?
That ice isnt believeable
wtf is goin on
what a twist
OLOL
Ohh
NO BOAT!
what a twist!
This part pisses me off
...Why is Haru so young?
And now you see why.
I remember this from a youtube clip!
>Captures Earth Benders
Wah wah waaaaaaah
who's haru?
Get ready for some dancing!
the lag is terrible
>Keeps them in A FUCKING ROCK QUARRY
HAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUU!
dem costumes
Where is the One Piece?
idk
RAWRity: This
They've trapped a bunch of Earth Benders in a rock quarry.
....
this is that coal mineing part...
>Earthbender prison camp
how smart
/me facepalms
ON EARTH
>made out of earth and rocks
Sol: the one that will make my dreams come true?
I dunno, guys
DO YOU SEE WHY I HATE YOU, MOVIE?
AND THEY ARE STILL WINNING THE WAR!!!
That's like trapping Waterbenders in an aquarium.
The Sixth Sense was a pretty good movie, surely this can't be too bad
lol
See what I mean about logic missing here?
HERE IT COMES. THE WORST. SCENE. EVER. FILMED.
lol
Acting: sucks. Waterbending: Not bad. Fire Bending: Could be better. Earth Bending: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!
you know when they earth benders where on a metal platform in the ocen so they couldn't bend
OH GOD
XD
inb4 Pebble Dance
They imprison the earth benders on the one thing they and only they can use!
inb4 DANCEBENDING
TERRIBLE SPEECH
you don't need live like this
pebble dance?
2,14 I LOVE this scene *trollface*
THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE PLOTHOLE AANG
wat
now the earth benders are just pussys
dirt
here?
In the anime they imprisoned them on a metal ship out in the ocean
NAH
07,01you do?
TOPH WOULD KICK THEIR ASSES
/me pokes ValtheJean hard on the shoulder
And it gets better. THe firebenders can't make fire
THey need to use the torches
I leave for a minute and we're already at the Earth Nation?
i call BS, he doesnt have blue skin
Toph could kick all their asses. Because she's /Toph/
fug logic im m night shamalan
BLOW OUT THE FIRE
Shadow
oh god this is bad
Yet noone puts out those torches when they fight.
6inb4 hilarious rock dance
lololol no boat, no intricate plan, skipping.
looks like they stuffed the whole damn series into one movie
airbending sounds OP
IT'S RIGHT THERE
nope.avi
here comes the Pebble Dance!
OH SHIT, SO MUCH FRAME SKIPPING
All one shot
that is pretty goddamn stupid
shamylan failed when he did this
They did Dark_Horst
AND THIS IS NOT HOW YOU SHOOT AN ACTION SCENE
that was so slow
seeing as theres air everywhere
that firebending looks STUPID
dat slow ass fire
...Why did that earthbending look so. . .weak?
slow motion replay
oh waity
CAMEO: ['M. Night Shymalan'] During the earth kingdom slave camp, he is the Firebender who yells "All Airbenders should be dead, Kill him!"
....
06It seems so. . . . . .
nice skip
god
Why didn't the earth bender rebel earlier?
that...
also
6PUT OUT THE FIRE
that hurt
This looks like a high school play
HERE IT IS
Nice dance.
His cheeks get all chubby when he tried to look serious :3
PEBBLE DANCE!!!
fight scene = make it slow as fuck
If you think it's lagging, refresh the page, it's completely smooth.
dat attack spam
And what happened to awesome I shoot fire out of my FISTS firebending?
How many earth benders does it take to move one rock
Just put out the cauldron and they loose
lol choreographed attack pattern
REMEMBER PEOPLE, BENDING HERE IS DANCING, THEN THE ACTION HAPPENS
god that movie is aweful
6
6Hilarious rock dance is hilarious
DANCE DACNE REVOLUUTION; FUCKERS
no, it's not lagging.
WAT
:D
this bending is not remotely good looking
06Slow motion. . .
all dat dance for a single rock
No, I'm in high school. I've been in plays batter than this
Why are all the elements moving so dang slowly?
oh my
the scene really is going this slow
That dancing
And he just stands there, taking it.
i didn't refresh. but the lag stopped.
/me weeps bitterly
Hi every- OH GOD NOOOOOO

Huzzah! NO LAG
HAHAHA
High School Musical + Bending?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

And then they won
ugh, im going to find the cartoon, cya guys
All that dancing and such a tiny rock

Hi PreteOH NOOOO
WHOA, epic skip
High School Bender
6LOL LOTR MUSIC
lol EspyLacopa
missed half the battle
I dont blame you
6 guys, doing a 10 second dance, move one rock
aaaand, lag
AIR BENDERS ARE OP SO FIREBENDERS NERFED EM
it's like they swaped martial arts for dance...
That was the most half-assed fight scene I've ever seen.
NO THEY DIDN
06ohmy this movie. . .
He is OP in this movie
that was the shittest thing i have ever seen
I remember seeing a funny scene that went here
*T
It got cut
actually, ill stay in the chat and pause the stream
Dermathil: nope. it was just that short
Hey guys.
That scroll was stolen from pirates, you liars!
Wait. Waitwaitwait. . .wait. That was a fight scene?
I COULD HAVE THROWN THAT ROCK!
Isn't it terrible how Sokka hasn't been funny ONCE?
then go to youtube
/me just arrived here and thanks God for the fact that my screen can only show the chat.
YES
yes it was angry dancing
Ohai shoehorned reference to the show
/me hugs ThePretender
I acutally liked Sokka in the show
that's how they fight
Ohai
SHE IS NOT SUPPOST TO HAVE THIS!
Its a good thing you're not watching
they dance agrily
Yeah
He was great
Where are the vikings?
And felt kinda sorry for him
/me hugs Flaria back.
WHERE IS SUKI?
Since he couldn;t bend and all
lets ignor that awesome Pirate plots
SPOILER: Kiyoshi loved games
also, NO SUKI. YOU FAIL MOVIE.
EspyLacopa: yes, it was a fight scene
/me pats Flaria on the head.
He was funny, and weak, but at the same time serious and strong.
THEY DONT LEARN ABOUT THIS AVATAR UNTILL MONTHS LATER!
...
BULLSHIT!!!!!
He also actually had a personality
ohai Keoshia island
I don't use this computer for BMN because it's so small, but in this case...it's a blessing.
What Pirates?
/me sighs
set resolution to 1.5x, aquire window space
KIOSHI WAS A FUCKING AIRBENDER JACKASSES!!!
He was powerful in his own way, and when he learned that, he became powerful
sol, the one they stole the scroll from?
erm
who they get the scroll of
off
kioshi? where?
ahhhhvatar
silverscreen no she wasnt'
I'm being a troll
Like his intellence
6Kioshi was an Earthbender, Silver
:P
ROKU HAD A CHILDREN!
Toph. . .if she's at all accurate to the show. . .likely thinks every other earth bender in the world not only sucks at bending, but is a pansy who is scared of their element and is amazed they can do as much as they can do.
XD
For some reason, I get the feeling that this movie isn't keeping in line with the anime...
AAH VAH TAR
She was from Earth Kingdom. You're thinking of Yangchen
no, she's an earth bender
Would anyone happen to know if there is any way to fix the sound being about a second late?
what SirSprinkles said
He was a great planner, good with tactics and even a decent inventor
Lol, I just called it an anime.
Fillages
Also
Yep
meh i cant find a good utube
Eeyup
x3
/me failed.
i always call it anime
Yangchen was air
IDEA GUYS HAS AT LEAST IDEAS
not an anime
Roku was fire
I don't think we see Toph
Anakin's got a sound plan.
big eyes + asians = anime
Kioshi was a previous Avatar.
So NOW we decide to got to the North Pole.... although we were already headed that way....
....
I have never seen the anime, but I hear it is a good anime
seeing as the moive is just book 1
flower shower
WHAT HE SAYING? I KNOW NOTHING SINCE I SEE STILL FRAMES
She was earth/fire/water/airbender.
The episode where the learns swordfighting was sooo good.
GRATUITOUS CLOSEUP
/me 6has seen the anime at least five times over
oh my god, my perception of time is getting raped
take 1 minute for fight scene
It goes: Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kurruk, Yangchen
mfw when people call this an anime.
PinkamenaDianePie: Not at all. Shamylan failed when he did this (implying he has ever not failed)
anime= japanese animation
that dance
:\
you need a montage!
spend 5 minutes to decide to go to the North Pole
*he
Sixth Sense was a good movie :)
SirSprinkles: Same.
he takes so damn long to launch an airbender strike
that's just your definition IronPony
i go by mine
If you can call it an anime, It doesn't follow anime tropes very closely.
The next avatar in the cycle is Korra
:P
cloudrunner ther have been times where Shymalamadingdong didn't fail
SUDDENLY WATER
Like 6th Sense and Unbreakable
/me wants to see the Legend of Korra so bad.
AANG WAS A NATURAL IN WATERBENDING
Waaaaaaaateeeeer~
Yeah. And it's not just him. All bending is slow as hell
Speaking of Korra, did the new series come out yet?
a·nime/ˈanəˌmā/Noun: Japanese movie and television animation, often having a science fiction theme and sometimes including violent or explicitly sexual material.
KATARA HAD PROBLEMS
Grundle I take back my statement about Shamylan and his failing. He is just so bad that I forgot he did that one
nope Animo, next year, i believe
Footloose Aang would be disappoint in these dance moves
Um...no
Lookit her dance
Oh well, the video seems to be lagging a bit anyway, so it is probably about the connection and can't be fixed.
aww ok
Probably why she doesn't show up, she'd be embarrased by their all-encompassing pansiness.
this movie needs moar shipping
Unbreakable was amazing
wait he has trouble with water bending!
wasn't AAng much better at this than Katara?
Aang was a fucking pro at water bending.
if you say anime, people will think of bad dubbing and other things people hate about them.
dat skip
It came natural to him.
personally, I think Unbreakable was better than Sense
And the goddamn narrating
he's a damn progidi in the show
WE GET IT
THIS SCROLL, WHICH I GOT IN A SECRET LIBRARY.....!
AND NOW WE'RE HERE
HERE

Hush, Bethesda's lawyers might hear
seriously, who cast Ozai as a tubby guy with a jew fro?
lol
"HELLO, JON, I"M HERE AT THE FIRE GUYS REPORTING ON OUR CONQUEST OF THE WORLD"
but he found the Libary before they did
sOOhak?
xD
His name is never stated therefore, I can say he isn't Ozai
Tubby guy with jew fro? Shouldn't that be Iroh?
WHAT THEY SAYING? STILL FRAMES AGAIN
Win, ThePretender
ZHAO'S NAME WAS PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY!!
LOL
Erm... wasn't the bending world inhabited predominately by people of Aisan ethnicity?
"My Son"
That's Ozai
I don't they actually watched the shoe before making the movir
Julius Ceasar? Is that you?
Fuck you, Shamalan
LOL ThePretender
OZAI HAS A BADASS BEARD AND LONG HAIR
yes, they were. But all our main characters are white here for some reason.
thank you CriticKitten
Much to Katara's initial annoyance ^_^
where the hell did they get all these people? bollywood?
AND WAS VOICED BY MARK HAMILL
ahem, "Shyamalan"
dat stop
m night shamalan watched the show once then wrote the script
It's SHAMalan
That and the Fire Nation is filled with people who look Arabic...
I'm wearing a cloak to disguise my presence
I'm so closing the stream. I see NOTHING. THis is WORSE than starship troopers-level of lagginess.
Luna/Zecora Zuko
Shamalamadingdong.

07,01not sure if like...
shyamalan
6Yes, yes, let the hatred flow through you.
s Shamwow!
/me wonders if the guys at the Daily SHow rib Asif about being part o this movie.
Hey gues...what if they got Hamill to do a voice for an MLP villain?
i HAT YOUUU
Apparently he didn;t hear how they pronounced the names
HIDING MY BARELY VISIBLE SCAR
Shamalama-does-anyone-care?
He's trying to be Luna
I forgot how bad it was
Well, John Oliver was in Love Guru

i am sure i don
BEST IDEA EVER Rawrity
t
I saw it with riftracks a few weeks back
haaaands off the boy, osama
Random Trivia: The daughter of M. Shalalalaman was a great fan of the cartoon. He said he made the movie for her. No comment from the daughter has been heard since the movie came out.
And Jon Stewart was in Death to Smoochie
/me is glad he never saw this movie.
Wasn't Stewart in Pooty Tang
AWESOME!!
lol
MARK HAMILL?
agni key?
like a baws
This movie is how they re-converted Axel from A Clockwork Orange back into a psychopath.
Fuck this movie. I'm getting some pizza.
Lawl
waste of money tbh :-/
by show he means tell
MARK HAMILL IS BEST JOKER
lol
DISCUSS
Wow is that true?
i would hate to be the daughter
D:<
PinkamenaDianePie: Don't forget the candy corn.
ya its true
AGNI KEY DUEL!?
It's absolutely true
Nicholson is the best joker :p
And now I'm going to explain my backstory in sad emo form instead of SHOWING IT LIKE A GOOD MOVIE WOULDA
Hamill is great actor.
/me burnt his pizza but ate it anyway
I'm going to be Alex from CO for Halloween, discuss
AZULA IS FUCKING UGLY!!
dude, that brat
> Azula
Yes i remember the sister
No
Zuko's scar lacks colour
Hey,how was the second movie last night?
WTF SHAMALAMABLARGARBLE!?
no freking way
A movie so bad even the daughter hates it with the passion
07,01FUN!
no Azula cameo?
THAT'S NOT HOW AZULA WORKS.
Although her name scapes me at the moment
Also Hey.
no Azula
Azula looked hot to me.
That was Azula?
SHYAMALAMASAMA
I guess it should be good she escaped this terrible story
wat
I liked Heath Ledgers joker but i guess thats just me.
Something with an A?
Azula is too badass for this SHIT ;)
I have to wonder what was going through their heads when they got Shamalamadingdong to direct this movie.
god this movie is in a marathon
Azula?
That was supposed to be the psychotic bitch?
She looks like a bratty little sister who told their parents about her brother's porn stache, not an intimidating villain
ya
IronPony, it's just you
Shamalawnmowerman
I think thats it
I remember a pic of the casting for Azula... she looked pretty good for it
just missed Azula
darn
Tovler that made me laught "burnt his pizza but ate it anyways" oh god win
pretender you didn't miss much
AANG DIDN'T HAVE SUCH EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE
6REVOLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTION! ...airbending
double Lunas!
it's spelled porn stash not porn stache :P
Man, she ranks right up there in the top of female villains.
trust me, you DON'T want to see that azulka
AND HE COULD BEND WATER PERFECTLY
everyone looks like they're braindead in this movie
Hello SploogeTheFish
Heath Ledger's was the most chaotic and unpredictable. Nicholson's had the most fucked up. Mark Hamill did the best Joker voice.
Hey flaria.
...You don't think a Pornstache exists?
Also the moive's Zuko lacks all that lovely inner conflict that is papable
Heath Ledger was best joker
Yeah,I came here pretty late.
Competent, intelligent, talented, powerful, powerhungry, crazy and deeply disturbed.
Flutterz what do you mean? twirls porn stache
Its been way too long since I watched the show
Heath Ledger was ok Joker
and then there was the riddler
Hamill... Best Joker. ;x
Curse these flashbacks!
SploogeTheFish: Lucky you.
aye
Thank You InsertCupcake
HE was awesome
The casting is shit, the voice acting is shit, the choreographers are shit, this movie must be fertalizer. Anyone try buring it in their gardens?
jim carrey ftw
Yo CloudRunner.
I mean this *twirls porn stash*
They're all good in their own special ways, I just prefer Nicholson
Mix Heath Ledger's chaos, Nicholson's fuckedupness, and Hamill's voice for the Super Joker?
he did an amazing job, but my qualm is the it' the definitive one
MARK HAMILL IS ARKHAM JOKER
yo SploogeTheFish
mARK HAMill
... hell THIS movie would've been closer to the original if jim carrey played aang
Gah, That is a shit CGI
Did they even tell us Appa's name?
Appa, yipyip
07,01is there still lag?
07,01i'm fine
I'd honestly love to see Hamill try a live action Joker.
Or the Lemur's?
This movie lacks a lot of things.
07,01eerrrr
2,14 it's horrendous for me
ugh this lag...
It'll never happen, but who knows.
6Seriousness needs to DIE
Maybe the TWEEEST is that he's still in the ice, and these are all coma dreams.
This movie would be better if all the characters were played by tommy wiseau
Avatar The Last Airbender
I know Polarfire
07,01there is now..
Harry Potter had restricted casting and they still pulled it off.
I can't get the stream to stop skipping/creezing. And I have a good internet connection >.<
My player is skipping pretty bad
so which room is winning Luna?
I think they didn't even say Appa's name at all
freezing*
mine too
I could make a better movie in my back yard... good thing I live in Bahsing Se
yes
Replace the Zuko actor with Keanu Reeves?

07,01RBD :'(
The lag is actually an improvement on this fucking movie.
and bronystate never lags for me
It pauses for like a 3-4 seconds
Skipping/lagging for me, too
That would acutally be nice since I could pretend this didn't happen
Yeah, mine's starting to skip too, and it was working fine earlier....
quick question, how long until it's over
lol Silverscreen
Did anyone read the IO9 article on this movie?
:'(
:( I've never seen Watership down, but I'll pretty much miss it at this rate.
the twist is that this is all just m night shamalns wet dream at the end
its the internet resisting the movie
terrible terrible laggage
Cosplayers manage a better Zuko than this guy.
so I can shower/do chores/switch computers
Northen air temple. looks like shit
FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!

I think it would be faster to ask who it isn't lagging and skipping for.
Yeah this Lag is screwing me
Really, I don't think it's just me. Never had problems with the stream like this before.
the lag rises and falls like the ocean being waterbent by the moon

INB4 BLUE SPIRIT
Like a gross STD you footfetish people get.

still ninja Zuko was fun
He was going to eat some buttered toast afterwards
"EARTH BENDERS! THERE IS DIRT UNDER YOUR FEET! THERE'S DIRT ALL AROUND YOU! WHY DON'T YOU FIGHT?" And everybody's like, "Whoa."
So, Zuko in Mask time?
i don't like feet
He get's captured more than Princess Peach
only paws
lol
inb4 even more shitty editing
So where ya from? With a name like that I'm guessing some shitty place like Niggerstan
Oh good, more shroom-trippiness
and hooves
and even the Blue Spirit looks fucking stupid
They needed INSPIRATION
and socks
inb4 it takes longer than normal to get out of spirit mode

Sadness?
Who dares banisha nigga like me?
Dairy or Dahri?
Thankfully, Legend of Korra comes next year, and we can all pretend this never happened.
6You can get in #Celestia now, Silver
/me pumps his fist in the air to rouse everybody!
After heavy criticism on his work on The Last Airbender, Shyamalan was told by his coworkers that atleast he couldn't make the second movie any worse. He replied with "is that a challenge?"
D:
Pretty much
IronPony: Why
The mods, pony_3434
Like this one girl went in in full Kyoshi warrior cosplay
Well, at least he's still hillarious
apply Flutterz correction to my text
ironpony he can't, because this movie bombed
Only to find out they'd been cut completely from the movie
Hello lobby
:(
Dairy Queen LOL
2,14 well, technically it was me before :P
lol
lemonlime
ah fuck it
Ok.
The theatre didn't like bananas
The lag in this movie was worse when the admin was telling some nasty fanfic this morning. :l
Is the stream supposed to not work?
Flutterz, what?
She was crying I think? They didn't show her afterwards
And that's why they don't have movies in Ponyville any more.
Now would be a good time to go read that article
Good thing this movie bombed, if it did well then we have another bad movie sequel
I'll embed the link in a second.
Look there.
Dairy Queen = awesome icecream
yeah it was lag-ship troopering
It shouldn't be laggin anymore it was Owncast, I'm fairly sure.
True that darf...True that
I know that that video kept being pulled down, along with all other youtubes that showed parts of the movie
When this movie aired, MLP:FIM was only 4 months away
now for 30 second advertisement
SploogeTheFish: the rape one or the one where he didnt stop reading and crushed my soul?
ah
so its down with Dari fixes
ooh veemi again
it's lie the s premier all over again
Both of them, CloudRunner.
*s2 premiere
SploogeTheFish: of course not implying that the rape one didnt crush my soul just thinking about it
wait...
tiny bit of lag there
Yeah. Thinking about it was horriying
*Horrifying*
so do we refresh the page?
2010 in general was not a good year for adaptations. Not only did we get this, we got Percy Jackson too. and THAT thing is getting a sequel.
<mfw the movie is still buffering
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=g5ywgwegasdfgh

I had no lag then SploogeTheFish... I caught every word... and I regret that
Not for me.

Still, 30 minutes of this movie was lagged. Oh well
Should i refresh?
Tovler oh what a shame
stream is offline
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=g5ywgwegasdfgh

By M. Night Shamalyan
Yes.
can I join?
BladeRunner: Nice.
Backwards sideburns
Why is the Fire Nation set in Northern Africa?
good question :|
So is the movie pretty much the whole series cut down to 60 min and done in real live acting instead of animation? (I have only watched 2 or so episodes of the original series, and heard it was a good show)
OH SHIT!
HOW DOES ZHAO KEEP GOIIN TO THE PALACE, AND THEN BACK TO THE FIELD SO QUICK?
I didn't figure it out until the end
The shorter guy is Toph I bet
BladeRunner!?

the Blue Spirit scene, I guess...
Guys,My name is not Mib
Yeah. He crammed the entire season into one
Its a good job im not a fan of the anime or id be really pissed
I'm probably not who you think I am :P
I'm a PC and killing the moon was my idea
silverscreen and it was a STUPID plan at that.

SLOPPY
Aparently SParring equals throwing water baloons at each other
Cousin Blade
LOL
cool water effects bro
So sparring is now just one guy throwing stuff at the other and the other being unimpressed?
My real name isnt BladeRunner
scary name if you ask me
it's Deckard
wtf, they had to have had more talented kids try out for this part
are they dancing
Aang doesn't train, he just fucks around while Katara trains
Did he just call him An?
Let's see some bloodbending
I think they are.

Breaking the laws of physics.
why?
lol
Why is nothing on my computer working today <.<
I think Katara said they became 'fast friends"
stop it
2,14 no, I'd rather you not
Just look at all that raw emotion in their faces.
I would say that my hair is white because I was trying to look more like Padme
its creepy
It doesn't help that her EYEBROWS are a different color
Can you link me Val?
Nope!
This part was in the show, But in the show they ACTUALLY showed what happened..Not just explaining it...Piece of shit scene
I can't tell if she said "white then" or "wight then"...
I'm waiting for one of them to say "I LOVE THE WATER"
Quick, start talking about sand!
:|
fine
11Suddenly, blue text.
2,14 link you what?
Veemi
07,01yay
Does this movie have Zhao The Moonslayer?
cant even sync right now
SILVERSCREEN, I WILL GET YOU FOR PICKING THIS MOVIE
iroh is the only good actor in this movie
The new stream
Eee-NOPE
Totally unsacredly
2,14 please pay attention to the mane chat: we're on http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/ now
"I'm pretty sure Zhao tried to kill you. He was awfully smug."
>Zhao has no sacredness
WTF. fail script
Nice dancing...lolwut
That's where I'm at

quiet? fine. :\
Yeah Iroh is...well
when did this turn to blades of glory?
2,14 well, that's where we're streaming :P
I will give this movie one thing. It's score can get pretty good at times.
They're not even in sync! D:<
thank y-
I really liked Iroh in the show
o/` all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies. o/`
LOL cupcake
no prob
I'm back...why is Bronystate streaming on a backup site?
Zhao has no /appreciation for the sacred?/ Zhao has no /respect for sacredness?/ so easy to rewrite that line...
he's good, but you can tell most of the time he's got this 'what the hell am I doing here' look
Nevermind
ALL THE SINGLE LADIES, ALL THE SINGLE LADIES
Did someone say cupcake?! :D
um...
Yeah he is better than most of them
So put yo hands up!
I hate it when you
11I am actually regretting choosing this movie now.
they forgot the water special effects
I think they're saving Bumi for the possible sequel
end your scentences?
yay soot
The stream on the normal website isnt working correctly, So were on the backup
Hey black snow, thats rare
GASP
barry theere's never gonna be a sequel
11The sequel shouldn't happen.
This part is epic
/me pats Silverscreen on the back.
for the love of Celestia
BUMI WASN'T EMO ENOUGH FOR THIS MOVIE
In the show anyway
nope not gonna stop
/me will now go watch the entire series to get this out of his head
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
Now they need LotR orcs-are-coming music.
Are you saying that because Paramount will never greenlight a sequel?
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUU DUN DUN
Yeah, it was the first real battle; war battle
I ha-
2,14 please keep your sentences in one post if possible
The ashes of your family.
no you dont
WATER BENDERS, KILL YOUR LIGHT!
And I thought it was going to be the other Avatar movie, I hate similar titles
There never will be a sequel, This shit movie went ass first in horrible critisim.
Barry yes. it's not gonna happen. trust me.
2,14 few word fragments are considered spam
Yet that critisim was correct.
It showed it wasn't just soldiers vs the avatar; but that there was a whole war going on.
Not chi, fire retard
Oh ok... sorry
both Avatar movies are pretty bad, so...
So uh
I don't know. Dragonball Evolution has a Sequel and a redoing in the making
ya
THERE ARE TORCHES IN THE WATER TRIBE. PUT THEM OUT!!!
The show wasnt bad, But this movie was.
Aren't they making a Cowboy Bebop movie
Talk to you later CloudRunner
And then Zuko froze to death
The show was Godly
Bye
This is horrific
His chi is warming him! :D
best part of the movie
It was a cartoon, so it didn't show blood, but all the fighting and dying had a powerful impact.
which is sad
06but
I am pretty sure you would freeze to death prettz quickly..
06Val
Nice wearing fingerless gloves in the water dumbass Zuko.
So, I'm expecting AKIRA to be the TLA for 2013
06I thought
06you
CGI is bad.
06liked
06lots
06of
06messages
It's a plot hole
wait REAL firebending not that BS we saw before
06;D
They're doing AKIRA?
That reminds me, DB:E, I'm guessing that's a B Movie
2,14 if I had OP...you would SO be kicked right now
he heats up the ice without having a flame handy
Wait
Whhhyyyy ;_;
JC's Avatar was just cliche as hell. It was great if you rarity see movies.
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO HIS ARROW?
*rarily*
06Challenge Accepted
the akira movie is so bad its funny
Sol yep, and they're planning to have all the actos be white
teh spirits
Its in dots now
Yet evry toher time they need a source
Didn't the Fire Nation attack at night in the show?
I thouht the CGI was alright in this film, compared to some of the CGI I've seen.
Yes
06<3
06There is love Val .. .
Some of the cgi is good some of it is terrible
No
well
THEY WILL FIGHT DEEP INTO THE NIGHT
That's his CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Sorry bout my Twin sister guys...
No, they attacked late in the day
The fire CGI is the best. The water is easily worst.
sure
It went into the night
yes
More slow dancing coming.
Pinkamenadianepie: I Think they invaded again at night, they got there ass kicked
Oh look, the secret feng shui garden
It lasted two days and nights
moon fish
Ah, okay.
11The CGI is the only thing consistantly good in this movie.
I thought you had to be a master airbender
Yup
nnnn, the effects were ok although, special effects have peaked.
It made Aang special, you know?
07,01hmm?
I wouldn't call it 'good'
x3
They attacked during the day, then backed off for the night, attacked the next day, and then fought in the night after Zhao killed the moon spirit
OHNG
I just shivered,
CGI isn't something to brag about anymore
inb4 shoved in romance
They cant pronounce Aang for SHIT.
Ang is special (in the head) in this movie
Tht's a bad ass torch
>In-show Aang: SHADDUP
that's*
he's gay for the Avatar too?
Its AIENG
GASP.
Not UHNG
FIRE LORD'S SON
So you have a city that is on high alert, in the middle of mobilization, and one kid gets into the most secure area there is undetected.
KILL HIS TORCH
It's Ahng
Bad guys attacking, I guess I will just sit down and meditate.(sorry, maybe I just don't know so much about the show)
Dumb broad
douse the water source? nah
Best fight ever.
>Movie Ong: lolwhatever, ahma sleep
Yep
It's been a whole season, but I still don't know your name
TORCH HIS GASTANK
slow fighitng ftw?
seriously, why did they change Firebending?
The proper pronunciation is Ahng
*Idea comes*
Fire attack! Water Shield! Fire attack! Water Shield! Fire attack! Water Shield!
11"who are you"
Water shield
yeah
Use the water to put out the fire!
Wait, how is her name spelled?
The name's Bon; Bon Bon.
You're not Katara...
Hey, WE SHOULD STREAM THE SIMPSONS MOVIE!
Humma Kavula?
"Good for you. BURN
she should have said there are loads of us
Hmm theres a small fire patch there...ignore it and defend
It's like a bad fight between a fire mage and a shaman
You'd actually beat them faster with your regular fists.
we didnt start the fire...
THEY PRONOUNCED HER NAME RIGHT!
YES!q!
lolwut
Mele Kalikimaka?
LOOK AT THE TORCHES
Raip time? :P
Of course they did. They did the same in the show
THEY NEVER PUT THEM OUT
Just look at all those fires all over the city, noone thinks of putting them out...
4Still deciding what color to use :P
I don't know how they could do the third season as a movie, Zuko gets sexy, that guy could NEVER be sexy
HEY LOOK ITS LORD OF THE RINGS
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WTF
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOoOOooOoooooooo..

SUDDENLY YODELING
Hey look, they're lined up against the wall. NEVER SEEN THIS IN ANOTHER MOVIE BEFORE. OWAIT LOTR

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
fanboy cosplayers
yodel them to death
Erm?
Who?
NO IT'S DIFFERENT! IT'S SNOWING.
These warriors look like shit compared to the show
That must have been the lames battle-cry ever.
Sucks that no one told them to use bows..
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It's Ahng, Kah-tah-rah, Sohkka, EE-roh Zookoh, Ah-Zoo-lah
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE is better though
lamest*
AND THERE ARE BOATS
Battleships! hmm......B6?
The cry of Owlicious.
WHoooO WhoooooOoO
Maybe they'll throw snowballs.
Coppercab:SHUT THE FUCK UP!
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
have you guys seen the "Battleship" trailer?
Like really icy snowballs
Just like he does to his poor dog.
FUCK HIM AND HIS SCROLL
So they hurt
Yes we know about the goddamn scrolls already
07,01well :) we need to see what's available
huh? Battleship trailer?
11...that's not a rhino.
This is like the fourth time they bring up the scrolls so far.
Scroll? Like an elder scroll? So confusing
07,01but that can wait till after the weekend
There's the catapults!
6SHOOT THE FIRE! BE THE RIDER!
I cant see the stream
The show was pronouncing almost every name wrong
wait, I thought there were people on that wall?
:(
ARISE MY MINIONS
What peple?
ugh
they're doing a movie based on the "Battleship" game. Starring Liam Neeson
IF THEY SAY SCROLLS ONE MORE TIME BETHESDA IS GOING TO SUE THEM
15Sounds fair :P
There were never any people
back everyone
the guys with the spears
Yep
... are you sure?
going hooooo
THE SCROLL FROM THE SECRET GREAT LIBRARY
also, is the stream still down
11The battleship movie is going to suck ass.
what....how would that even work?
uhng
07,01can't you set a dark blackground in your client?
UHNG
acting
Barry seeing as it was names THEY MADE UP. they were pronouncing it right.
hasn't the battleship movie been released already?
NOW you know his name?
THEY NEVER EXISTED YOU ARE MISTAKEN
OHNG
And it apparently has Transformers
07,01as in a combination of 2 colours?
ThePretender: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
Yeah
His arrow on his head is total shit
07,01try that
HERE COMES THE TWIST ENDING GUISE
They went to get some tea. Their feet got cold.
thankke dari
Why does everyone care about Aang then?
@RAWRity Really?! I need to see this. *goes to youtube*
11They're doing some kind of Transformers meets Battlship thing for it. IT's fucking stupid.
darken_skye not yet, just the trailer so far
lol
8,4Something crazy like this?
Does he posess supah powurs?
The next thing you know, they'll make movies based on Connect 4, Chess, and Checkers
Robert Pattinson stars as Josef Stalin, in... BATTLESHIP.
Its suppose to be BOLD BLUE...not with fucking random drawings for it
Zuko, why are you narrarating to an unconscious bald brat?
Aang? Yeah
wait what
Oh I remember this part!
Ong just sucks
Yes
Use the force, Aang
07,01for instance
:3
The Red Tornado has the movie rights to the literal Arrow Forehead.
he should
I still think the dragon should be voiced by Sean Connery.
07,01or something a bit less bright ;)
The real twist would be if this movie suddenly got good.
I'll stick with those colors lol
That dragon looks like shit..I mean his jaw doesnt even move
Aang is a furking badass
11Barry: they already made a movie based on Chess. It's called Braveheart :P
Why is he always sleeping?
who's voice is this
He's baked
don't let anger control you!
Wait what?
An old guy
Sean Connery hates todays movies.
or you will turn to the dark side.
07,01nooo
so he can speak to the spirit world
Steal his face!
Well... I thought I did...
5lol :P
Oh, you guys want to hear something good?
What next? A movie on Monopoly?
Use water to beat fire? GENIUS
Where's Ahng's previous avatar self?
Can you honestly tell the difference in acting though?
Hey Ggala, When do you want to play arcanists again
Tolvler: Can you blame him?
Oh bullshit he isn't meant to hurt others. WHAT DO YOU THINK BENDING'S MADE FOR?!
It's telepathy. I think.
Screw the spirit world, I bet it doesn't have MLP: FiM
KOH, Y U NO IN THIS MOVIE?
power of water. Hydro electricity
Well thanks, dragon. You've offered no advice at all
There are going to be TWO MORE MOVIES.
Darf14, Don't give them ideas
How about a movie based on mouse trap
WHAT
Capture number 4.
PUSH THAT MOTHERFUCKER OUT THE WINDOW
It has dragons
That's right
Or tic tac toe
That would be a hell of a movie
/me is sad Sean Connery's last movie was LoEG
and blue filters
IT'S A TRILOGY.
EMO MONOLOUGE
How did he possibly get ggreenlit after this?
EXTREME PARKOUR!!! not
Still they were pronouncing a name that has two consecutive "A"'s wrong
Wait, why are they in a house?
WAIT WAIT WAIT..... MORE ARE COMING?
At least Sean Connery was in a Michael Bay movie.
And Twilight forrests
Well, if he can't keep an tied up guy under controll.. he should probaly die.
and CGI?
The Rock was awesome
Hey admin
They should make a movie about rock-paper-scissors. The plot could be about a tournament with fights to the death.
It seems trilogies are all the rage these days.
Lets watch iron giant :D
And random bloom
Yeah, but even Michael Bay can make movie mistakes
I can cope with this moive
Sometime :3
Wait, was that the Star Wars soundtrack I just heard?
Eat super soaker!
iron giant is a sad movie
being a play telling the story of the show BADLY
x3
Sad buct awesome
Core, Kaiji has rock paper scissors
6Splooge, movies are chosen via lotto
I haven't seen it, but I'm sure Transformers 3 is such a mistake
Iron Giant is an awesome movie, which Lauren Faust worked on
Cool.
awesome indeed
Its cool, Lunas about to come help the benders out
1,8Testing
Barry that's basically all Bay makes. Have you SEEN Pearl harbor?
No lets watch The Rock. It's criminal that nobody has seen that movie.
You mean, like Transformers 1 and 2?
"We're going to kill Luna."
put on by the Ember Island Playesr? XP
The moon spirits?
you know that ep in the 3rd serries well this is the LA version of that
SHE DID!?
"Wat?"
No killing Luna :<
Lauren Faust indeed did work on The Iron Giant.
Players dammit
She did?
Spirits?
but only a few scenes I believe
Didn't know that!
YES
lol luna
there be ONE
She did, wow the more you know
Bay's The Island was passable
stupid zukko
lol
Faust also worked on "Cats Don't Dance" and "Quest for Camelot"
i is behind you
... Luna?
Along with Fosters home(She wrote all the episodes)
Zuko, you are a firebender. BURN EVERYTHING
That scene was in an earlier part of the series in the show
Even the mainchar makes no sense
Soka's GF x3
SHE'S NOT PROUD OF QUEST FOR CAMELOT
Quest of Camelot?! .....well we all make mistakes
I'LL SAVE YOU LUNA
/me fucking loves Quest for Camelot.
LOL
ugh, cant get stream to work
why is he trying to do that and then tries to run away?
i hope there's an explanation for why they pronounce their names that way
In the movie he can't firebend without a source
lol hes beating up a kid
And you wonder why your daddy hates you -.-
Come on, stop trying to hit me and hit me
Just pick the cheeky bastard up Zuko.
Quest for Camelot COULD have been good, but the studio cut it to shit.
Quest for Camelot was well animated. Y B ashamed?
UHNG! Y U NO BEND?!
i like pony
It's beause Shyamalan wanted to use the more asian pronunciations
well done MantisToboggan
EIP was best filler ep
THE MAIN CHARACTER
In the cartoon he can fire bend anytime he wants, even without a source
SHE WAS PATHETIC
Ah well. Soon Legend of Korra will be here and we can all forget this.
I like how Ktara is just walking calmly throught he warzone
Lauren Faust also Did KND,But only made the walking animations.
In the movie he can't. Only the strongest firebenders can
>More Asian pronunciations
THE COMIC RELIEF CHICKEN SAVED HER
>Mostly Indian actors
CRY
every bender is horrible in this movie
Guys you know what's fun? Changing your avatar to pony on an otherwise pony free forum that only has a couple of people on it
lag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All of these character are bent. Did I use that british term correctly?
yeah it was awesome
And enjoy the show
ungh
welcome back, lag
Yup
The spirit said use water
So, she knew he was there because of the fire? That was everywhere in the city?
tbh Avatar lacks much filler
All we need to do is stream The Iron Giant. PLEASE ADMIN, WE BEG OF YOU...PLEASE!! JUST STREAM UP AND MAKE US NOSTALGIA! :D
Hello I have A question has anyone ever had a problem with the stream not playing? I sit through the ad and all I get it a loading circle any thoughts on how to fix it so i can see the show?
Back to cartoon, kickass female new avatar, steampunk, noir detectives with hats and coats; lots of good stuff.
it allgets wraped uo to meaning something more or less
douse the lamps and torches?
Splooge, wait 'til you win the lottery.
even the play and beach episodes
I remember this battle being a lot more epic when I was a kid...
NEVER
FORESHADOWING
Then you can choose it,.
"The dragon spirit told me something about feelings and that I should waterbend. I hadn't considered waterbending before, oddly enough"
07,01Welll
foreshadowing
/me consumes a scone
Ice stll looks fake
Lion King is being streamed for Nostalgia
07,01Wait for next lottery :)
Killed by waterbenders? What about hypothermia?
?
you will just be killed by hypothermia
yea, being stuck and frozen for a good few days is not a death sentence at all!
07,01next week
We could be frriieeeennnnddddsssss
Lion King is being streamed because it's good
The Great Library! :D
what are the movies for nexct btw?
What should my troll pick be if I win the lottery
SCROLL
I'm thinking Attack of the Clones
Gabe...So is the iron giant.
:3
next lottery if you win you could choose The Iron Giant, Splooge.
1,12Welcome Turtaguin!
I haven't seen Lion King in forever. Will the Nostalgia kill me?
07,01also..
What are the movies for next week?
yes Grundle
07,01what is that...?!
also
Asif Mandiv still sounds like he's on the Daily Show
Watership down next yay
Appa has served almost no purpose in this movie at all
And the Lemur dissapeared
Probably so Tovler.
they're using lizard cavelry...in the arctic
i like how casual they walk through the war zone
SCROLL IS IMPORTANT
A troll movie would be something like, oh I don't know, a totally sucky movie
Like Attack of the Clones? :p
Troll 2 for troll movie
Oh noes, he's warming himself with his chi!
I enjoy how no one is trying to stop the Fire Benders walking right into the heart of the city.
When they're not dancing, they walk.
How'd HE BREATH!
Babes in Toyland
in ICE!
The Incredibles is one of the movies next week
koi mostly
I saw Bambi for the first time in like 20 years. Damn near killed me.
Why aren't the spirits guarded?
It's like shooting fish in a...oh wait.

bad Diftraku, no more Babes in Toy Land ;_;
It's always magic
SUDDENLY IT GOES BLACK AND WHITE
No, because the spirits are IDIOTS

Luna is a chicken?
What the fuck did he stab a voodoo doll?

Thy are just dancing.
They are loving in the moonlight..
EEROH KILLS A GIRL
having a wonderful time
WE ARE EACH BORN WITH A DESTINY. YOUR DESTINY IS TO DIE.
do it for luna
Don't listen to him, he's fire nation.
The cartoon showed that bending wasn't just used for fighting. It was also used for building, healing, repairing, nurturing, even entertainment. The movie shows none of that.
whiskey. tango. foxtrot.
YOUR REASON FOR BEING BORN WAS TO DIE
INB4 BELIEVE SPEECH
Oh god this movie
Does that girl die in the show too?
Quick save Luna by sacraficing yourself!
inb4 Anakin cries
bye hot white-haired chick!
YES
yes
BELIEVE IN YOUR BELIEFS
inb4 scene that seems sad but its not
rawrity Is that a FO: New Vegas refernce?
Because all those things would take time away from horrible acting
SURVIVE!
Luna > annoying padme knockoff
and narration
Yui becomes the moon
More prequel flashbacks
It also never showed the romance between Sokka and Yue
Doesn't she kind of become the new Moon Spirit?
By... dying, or something.
I WILL BECOME THE MOON
lol SploogeTheFish
Sokka: My girlfriend turned into the Moon
we believe in our beliefs
Zuko: That's rough man...
Not kind of, she does
You don't need live like this. He's Fire nation. Fucking shitty directing
Zuko: That's rough, buddy.
that's rough buddy
Good bye girlfriend 1
SHE USED "BELIEVE" 3 TIMES
YEAH! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!
That scene looks like it is ripped from the newer starwars movies
She banishes herself to the moon
which is sad
It reminds me of that story from the Wolverine film.
He was dating a moon
parappa
my beliefs are your beliefs so their beliefs what?
SokaXLuna fic GO!
cheesy love scene
Where the girlis the moon or something.
White hair girl: kthbai
KICK! PUNCH! IT'S ALL IN THE MIND!
Who can say, honestly, when they're actually staring death in the face, that they're not scared?

"Kthxbai
AND LUNA IS REVIVED
She is going TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAHHHHHH!!!!

Is it bad that anakin and padme has more emotion then this?
I know where Sokka can meet his mmmmgirlfriend.

I prefer the starwars prequels to this
THANK YOU ELEMENTS OF HARMONY
There's a really low amount of people in chat
Holy shit,Did you see those eyes
Not how that was supposed to happen but ok
ITS PRONOUNCED SOCK-UH GOD DAMNIT
And the vampires are impotent once again.
Well at least they were starwars..

like that Godsmack song
How do you "Ping"?
He's supposed to die...
THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE BOTCHED AVATAR
wut
INB4 ZHAO DROWNS BY NAMELESS WATERBENDER 1 TO 4!!
suddenly random water benders
And then, instead of a proper battle, Zhao gets WTFPwned by a bunch of nameless waterbenders.
Hes Screwed

yesterday should've been the same as the usual movie night numberes though, no?
Well, that was not so much the blue guy dodging as the red guy missing horribly
glub glub glub
"John, I've been deprived of any good fight scenes in this movie, and now I'm dead. I'm not sure why I signed up for this." Asif Mandiv, everypony.
OVERKILL!
EEEnope
He was eaten by the blob!
I can't get the stream to start up :/
And then they drowned him
ish
indeed CriticKitten
well, this sure is a brutal death.
Back to you... Jon *dies*
Go to Veemi
Is that guy dead?
well that was.... dark
why not bend the water inside his body?
DANCE BABY DANCE
wut
and here's the one decent action setpiece in this whole thing
Zack Snyder sues
I mean.. did the spirit not say to use water to not kill?
SLOW MOTION
Wait, he can still save himself. He just needs to warm himself with his chi!
And Shymalan prooves that he can rip off Zac Snyder
Well the figure skating is here for comic relief
wtf
best scene in the movie
???
unless i guess it was mainly providing an outlet for all that pent up energy between seasons and is less massive now with s2
ok, for some reason the stream wont work, anyone else having this problem?
Yep..And it just ended star.\
at least though, the actions are fluid and the elements are bending with it
he made them stop fighting so he could run past them?

Dance! Nothing left for me to do but dance! All these bad times I'm going through, just dance! I got canned heat in heels, tonight
07,01my my it sure is silent today :0
Badumpsh
Yeah, guess that could be it
THEY DON'T DO KOIZILLA!!!
inb4 flashback
flashback charge up!
Isn't this about the point where Aang turns into Fishzilla?
2,14 you should see #rarity :P
Like water, I will accept the shit out you.
Around here
the guy on the right has hair
:| It froze there.
07,01amw watching it ;)
SploogeTheFish, by 'ping' i just meant poke me, get my attention, say my name XD
Nope. Guess it's flashback time again.
flashbacks only depress me when I channel them.
I dun geddit
Water teaches love and tolerance. :o
Oh and I guess that school starting for various people could play a part in it
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD UNNGH
OH BOY MORE EXPOSISITION
07,01so is this movie almost over? :)
GGgala, When do you want to play arcanists though?
MY MONKS ARE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
You and your friends are dead. Game over.
flashback/narration/action/flashback/narration
6MY FRIENDS ARE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
order of the movie I guess.
yeah
give me a holler when watership doun is on (flies off)
Yeah
haahaha GabeMoist
i think its more school
SploogeTheFish, maybe after Watership Down
Q_Q
MY BACKSTORY IS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAP
THAT SONG SOUNDS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!
06ohmy
Wait
DANCE WATER DANCE
Well...that backstory was pointless
Alright, Can i see the news image?
It'll be on in 10 minutes, I think
he remembers his failure? how does that help him?
alright I gotta admit the Rifftrax is pretty great
Ung, y u no Avatar State?
Exactly.
So instead of giant water cthulu, he does a tidal wave.
07,014 team-members in Rarity and 2 viewers :D
Rifftrax makes everything better
bracing for Koizilla
UHNG USES SURFER!!!
there's the avatar state for 5 seconds
man, this part, neigh everything was so much cooler in the cartoon
....magic?
Aang, use Surf!
IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!!!!
6He has become one with the power of dance
you know, with scenes like this, i've always wondered if there would be one guy who jsut start stabbing people while they aren't looking. See how many people he'd get until somebody caught on
Does anybody remember when he transformed into that big ass monster? Where that fuck was that at?
And the tidal wave crushes the city of the waterbenders. The End.
OMG, the water guys are using the ocean against us, wut?
Rifftrax is ok, but you need to watch The Room in order to get half the jokes.
OHSHI-
that sucks
This battle uses the same logic that other Avatar movie used
NOT IN THIS MOVIE
It didn't make it into the film
Aww, no giant angry monster
Namely, noone has ever heard of long range bombardments.
HUMANS ARE EVIL?
that's right
No Space Squid?
even if it's not a school night still, busier
thanks whoever posted that backup link
luckily Broystate forced me to watch The Room so I'm prepared
Uhng uses intimidate!
appreciate it
I had to leave early yesterday because I wanted to do school stuff today. Being productive is lame :(
UHNG HAS GONE SUPER SAIYAN! Goku and Vegeta: lolno
:l
11Tovler: Wrong movie adaptation
Well I liked the other Avatar movie far more then this.
The giant sea monster was a combination of Aang's Avatar State and the spirit of the ocean
avatar needs more guns i guess
Funny, I seem to recall that in the cartoon they actually did use bombardments.
Koizilla was the only scene of the show that I was looking forward to, and it doesn't even make it into the effing film...
/me thinks that not even the music can save this movie.
Instead of watching this, can we watch Sokka on catcus juice?
I liked the other Avatar movie too, except for a. I wish the humans had more then two braincells and b. I wish the humans won.
You know, they also had a scene filmed with the Kyoshi Warriors, but cut it.
Nothing saved this movie other then the cheap ass CGI
Gotta give the music an A for effort
FRIENDLY MUSHROOM!
But how did this work anyway? He got rid of the ship, what about all thoe people already in the city?
And now, think about this:
i wish the humans won too
MUSHROOM SAMBA!!
I know it was. I was just enjoying the slight, well, not, randomness, but, ya'know...
and now we wait
So Aang didn't even do anything with the tidal wave?
How did the humans NOT win?
pussy
Yeah
In the movie, Aang lets the Fire Nation leave without breaking their ships
UHNG?
OHNG!
Plus, that goddamn tree
Aang isn't supposed to HURT PEOPLE
Ong Bak?
Don't they haver tanks in the future?
Oh, you've got a point.
So in theory, they could just come back after he's left
>_>
*SHAHAKHAKHAKHKKKHASAK
should be jobless
I don't care HOW valuable that floaty unobtainium was
and out of education like me
AANG DOESN'T SMILE IN THIS MOVIE
lots of time
what kind of Monk doesnt kill people?
not much money
anime>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>this flaming pile of horse apples
That tree was worth a hundred times as much.
Come on Aang, you should at least let the wave crush them all
Well the how did humans not win is what I asked myself in the 2nd(?) narnia movie.
ITS PRONOUNCED AYNG GOD DAMNIT
what time is the Waterboat Down movie starting?
stream won't start for me :/
Actually, Airbenders were taught that life is sacred. To the Avatar, that's not entirely true
And that's how equestria was made.
Imma let you finish..But tusken raiders shook there spears arond better.
Yeah, but in the show there's no way in hell they would
Not after they saw Koizilla
what's next?
at least I think it was narnia, prince capsian or whatever?
Watership down.
man, I can't wait for Legend of Korra
Meh
I haven't seen that in forever
UHNG?
they should hav ejust launched a missle at the tree and won
it's about bunnies that kill each other
ThePretender same
To the Avatar, the balance of life is more important than one or 100 lives
I don't
she's like the motherfucking Batman
PLEASE DON'T KILL US, MR AVATAR SIR
Hey look, none of the waterbenders are injured.
the happy kids movie
Thank Celestia. -___-
Not a single casualty!
Dance to the ending...
I can, there's too many games and tv shows on right now. Play Korra when nothing is on TV
They should now end with a narration
about bunnies
And now they dance!
It wasnt silent when my sister *shutters* showed up
"I'm never going to have a career after this film, am I?"
IT'S OVER

11YOU'RE WELCOME EVERYONE

but first, credits
Bring on the Bunny Killing!
I hope watership down is good. Please...Tell me, Is it good?
lol ss
F***K THIS MOVIE
/me chucks a bottle at SIlverscreen.
Shalalaman is undeniably talented. Noone, I mean noone, could have ruined a perfect story so utterly, so completely. Noone but him.
read this comic before watching Watership DOwn: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1d_thQV_AY/Tm_ZEUT7ZvI/AAAAAAAAAW0/sXdBamFxYno/s1600/FWC+-+Fluttership+Down+-+Bigger.jpg
THAT SUCKED, THE ANIMATED IS 1000 TIMES BETTER
Silverscreen should be banned from picking movies.
11I JUST GAVE YOU THE ONE MOVIE THAT'S *WORSE* THAN BABES IN TOYLAND AND SPIDERS WEB
sploogethefish it's pretty good
1.5, like a baws
oh tension is gone ang can sit on a beach for a year
Maybe he hated the fans of the series.
Silverscreen.... oh you
if he wanted to now...
;P
It's good if you don't read the book.
how bad was spider's web?
LAWL
So Watership down is next?
I'm curious... was this movie chosen intentionally because of its badness?
Really bad
actually...this MIGHT be SLIGHTLY better than Babe
This movie was at least shorter than Babes in Toyland.
*babes
Now we need him to make an MLP FIM movie and everyone will be happy... right? ;P
Core, it has to be.
who's ready for the classic Watership Down?
Yup core...Just like how the shitty ponies movie was chosen.
Coming up next, 'Avatar, the last airbender: the game: the movie' as directed by Uwe Boll.
DONT JOKE ABOUT THAT
/me feels his brain has failed just watching the last five minutes
MEE
Ok.
When it comes out on DVD, we should watch "Abducted". It' got an even lower Rotten Tomatoes score.
I liked Babes when it was 94 minutes long.
pfft, at least they had the foresight to realize their shitty actors would age
nah smurfs
like, I wouldn't mind watching this again instead of Babes in Toyland
Well, next up is Watership Down...
/me suddenly uhng comes in the screen and said thats what i said
07,01this movie...
what was that sound?
LIVE ACTION MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC MOVE DIRECTED BY M NIGHT SHAMALAN AND MICHEAL BAY!!!
lol
!
The sound of fairies dying.
Abducted was just mediocre, not roflbad
true
That was a ping
not like they need that...
Brony; he'd probably make it live action as well. Fursuits as far as the eye can see.
i saw watership down when I was 6
FTW!
being so BAD
07,01Alright

the world would implode
oh dari
WHY STREAM?! WHY WON'T YOU LOAD?!
I never saw watership down, Dont spoil it please.
Watership down changed me
Im going to have nightmares about that
did you just pause the movie or did my stream derp out
I've seen scenes from Watership Down and was like BWAH
My stream is still running.
THE HORN OF DESTINY
AAAAAAAAAAAH
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
The credits are rolling.
Shallalala, Uwe Boll and Michael Bay all team up to make a live action bodypain movie of FIM
no spoilers. Or River Song will get you.
So nothing interesting is happening.
So, now you've seen TLA. And hopefully now grasp why I hate this movie with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. xD
paint
oh god
aw, no ping
I'll skip this one as well :P
Well at least the acting can't be worse then this.
dari you silenced your IRC client then? :P
Poor Fluttershy, the next movie will tear her apart
TLA should probably be banished to the moon. Or the sun.
07,01Nooo Dift!
BRIGHT EYES! BURNING LIKE FIRE!
07,01you must stay!
LOL SPEED UP
07,01Pretty please?
lol
dari doesn't go DING when there's stuff anymore?
So many names. I don't have enough pages on my death note
No more Dari ding?
I'll be on the chat, I just won't be watching the movie :P
I've seen Ents act less wooden then these actors.
whoever directed this film ruined part of my childhood
suddenly fast forward
Broken soundcard remember?
So anyone here seen Watership Dowb?
I am surprised the credits even exist, if I was part in that movie I would forbit someone putting me into the credits.
Fix it Dari!
Watership Down is awesome
11If you think these credtis are long, you should have tried sitting throuhg the fucking Dark KNight credits.
I want to see watership down and see why everybody talks about it being bloody...IT BETTER BE DAMNIT.
Down*
i like this fast forward thing we got going here
I have not.
long credits is Loooooooooooonnnngggg!
Dark Knight credits were awesome because it had great music
Don't everypony pile in at once...
07,01it is bloody...
oh gosh those were so long silverscreen
I think I've seen it as a kid
Me neither
or they can make it like the SMURFS and make the ponies come to our world
Your shitting me?
Why could a movie with so many people in the credits be so bad?
It's a damn tearjerker, I am not even kidding.
holy crap those are long
damn the stream isnt loading for me
Don't worry, plenty of death and blood and mutilation in Watership
INB4 DRAMATIC MUSIC
