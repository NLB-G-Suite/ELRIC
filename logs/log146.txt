CSI: Time travel
Jack had a time travely watchy thingy
hes a time lord
The song I was quoting comes on on this episode, correct?
he's the Doctor's archnemesis
there was a time war a long time ago
that killed them
All
The Master is crazy.
He's a Time Lord, a crazy, murderous Time Lord.
He was in oldwho
He wants to kill everyone
He had a cool mustache
dat sexism
He ditched his rubbish beard.
ill refresh

hi StarEcho :)
heya :)
NO BACKSTORY FOR YOU
Whats with timelords not having real names?
seriously
Master
They do o.o;
They have names, we just don't know them.
because they all are born with screennames instead of actual monikers
they have Equestria esk names
why cant they just tell people their names?
seriously
oh she is a time lord too? The wife!
Because I dunno.
their names have to do with their specialty
It's like if we were all to just start using our forum screen names IRL
well, Jon
That would be AWESOME!
I am using my real name online.
Because how dissapointed would you be if the Doctor's name was Harold Johnson?
if an enemy were to go to back in time, they could find them as a child with their real name, and kill them
HA!
...Time war is timelocked.impossible to go in
lol Sharon Ousbourne.
suddenly Osbourne
Ahaha
Probably mispelled osbourne.
I want to vote Saxon now
I totally never would have though of that.
mine's even more clever. I added a W to rarity

Mine is the best. I blatantly stole it.

Well it is a creepy thing.

That would work too.
You know, that probably IS a rivet gun.
WE'LL KILL THE EVIL MASTERMIND WITH A PAINTBALL GUN
"Gather these pieces of the plot device scattered inconveniently across the world"
that gun is gonna be important
trust me.
I'm more making fun of the design
It's very important
That gun is going to be important for the sequel.
reminds me of HL2
Everypony dies! The end!
an important plot device
STRIDERS!
They probably did.
*chuckles*TRATIOR!
I can killem, just get me a grivity gun.
They did. They get $50 and a handful of toothpaste coupons to spend on CGI each episode.
There are plot devices all over the world!? I need to find Octavia's plot device!
/me starts the hunt
That women is a...ahh screw it, that joke is overused.

I changed my mind actually.
Ok...i don't like the reverseing time

no, that climax was pretty bad.
I found it shallow and pandantic.
Second to last of his race does kinda perish.
But I'm alright with it.
no, it's still terrible. Martha got screwed.
:D
me too
What's with the burning
I'm fine with everything after time reverses
why must we always burn things
Timelord's body can't be found.

I don't get it...
Jack is the Face of Boe

This is the series finale?
You have to watch the older episodes to understand it
Darn, ok.
No. This is season 3 finale.

This is the 3rd series finale (British shows run in series not seasons)

That was a good one.
Was there another season after this one?

Lawl
Hardly any is.
BBC Ponies
BBC is something like 5 of 1000 channels.
I like the BBC.
I dunno, we don't have one?
yes dari but saying it's on 4 would be like me saying turn to 101 for ponies.
America is the only country that NEEDS a parody news show.
The channel is literally CALLED channel 4.
It was one of the first TV channels.
The 4th.
:P
BS dari
Was this their first show? :P
Lol. No. XD
Man, I wish we had a channel that was just called channel 4, I'm sick of all these stupid channel names.
"576i" LOL
"The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the television licence-funded BBC's two services and the single commercial broadcasting network, ITV."
It was the 4th TV channel.
Its name is channel 4.
Deal with it.
SUDDENLY SLOWMO
"Time to watch BBC!" "Which channel is it on??" "There's only FOUR channels, just flip through them. You'll find it."
Well originally BBC was the only channel I think.

She's cool.
How could there possibly be THAT many different shows to fit those channels?!

I can gauruntee it wont get out,Lets just go on a pony marathon on the 31st
Oh.
leet oclock
I got two suggestions
Pony scary storys(Not fanfics) or a pony marathon on the 31st
GGgala: good point
lol'
I dont know, Not anybody wants fanfics(Especially rape ones or violent)
I dont even want those horrid creations
HAHAHAHAHHA
There are a lot of fanfics, bound to be scary ones that aren't like that.
...
lawl
pointless
(A.K.A Call of Cuty)
*Duty*
ohhh
O.e
*about. *patties
Scary is ok. Kicking in Fluttershy's head (and failing requiring more kicking) and or raping her is not!
Coolio
Sad is ok. Hurting Fluttershy is not.
^
awwwww yeah
But especialy Fluttershy
But hurting fluttershy is over the top.

Oh well!

I just don't watch tv really...tv licenses are too expensive
It's impossible
We we're patient for like how many moths
monthes*
It was amazing when she barged into his room
I forgot
we need more ponies in england
but they were MANY
we need the hub down here :P
we need pony's in holland too
Kind of.
But this is much more realistic.
if you ask me, we should have one world wide tv service
She looks a lot like Emma Watson
The middle seems at lot more sitcom staged.
The Middle?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/10/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-scumbag-hub-gimme-my-ponies/
everyone could watch pony's(and anime)
But the middle has the janitor from Scrubs, which makes it awesome
english ones arent to bad if you ask me
well now i have to see The Middle
Time .. for a revolution
^
they aren't too bad aye...but they still annoy the heck outta me :P
Unbelievable

SPONGEBOBBLE!

As for me, gotta drive south to our tenants, because they're too incompetent to unclog the central A/C drainage pipe
Outch, that sucks..

The meds made it not hurt, but made me sleepy and I zoned out more than usual.
I'm normally asleep by now. I'm going to need coffee to make it through this.

I'm going to have to make like the camera man from UHF and chug coffee straight from the pot

Eh, alright I suppose. Yourself/
hey guys! I'm back!
I liked the Keanu Reeves version of Toyland

It could be worse
TLA is worse than Babes?
I really wanna go to FushiCon now

/me secretly liked Toyland
I hear its REALLY bad
Loved that movie

Especially if you watched the anime
i heard it was ok
Big's good
RAGE!
Babes in Toyland was very misleading...
Dunno if it's worse than Babes in Toyland, but it's pretty damn awful
i never watched the anime
Listen, "The Last Airbender" May very well be the worst movie in the last 30 years.
Ha, well, if you can find a way to make homework exciting.... XD

I WANNA GO TO FUSHICON! [/applebloom]
AMerican Anime is when a US company tries to make a cartoon in a style similar to anime
And that's the only good part of the movie
GGgala: This is only the start
anyway, movie tiem
reruns of nightcourt filled our nights.
is that spposed to be katara?
I think
I dont like how Katara looks in this
ahhhvatar
ARVATAR?
Ewwwwwwwww
Wow, they couldn't even pronounce Avatar right. XD
Earth Kingdom
Air Nomads
Does this version of Katara have a fascination with hope and crying?
Avatar? Isn't that the movie about the blue natives or something?
AUHvatar
That scene
Terrible intro is terrible.
AND THATS HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
Hear that guys, THE AHHHHVATAHHHHHR
I think yes Espy
That's more like a deleted scene from You Got Served
Yes, they mispronounced Avatar. Another sign of the horror yet to come: they can't pronounce the lead character's name or title
Book? I thought we were watching a movie.
2,14 CHEESECAKE
Not Tov?
hey any excuse
fail
Ignore the movie and watch the cartoon
Hey look, it's Anakin Skywalker
I think shes sorry
SMACK THE BITCH

Moist is a fantastic word!

Shamalan changed all pronounciations to make it reflect it's japanese-esque roots more, despite the fact that it was an American cartoon.
Zhuko
The creators of Avatar never disowned this picture.

....Why is Appa's saddle there already?

The bison is the best part of this movie.....I can't believe I just typed that

Spears? Since when?
sookah?
exposition
TRIVIA: Jesse McCartney was originally cast to play Zuko, but was replaced with Dev Patel due to scheduling conflicts.
Shamalon wanted the nations to represent actual nations of the world, setting each nation to be a different race.
bwa ha ha ha
sookah
Oh yeah

I'M YELLING TO MAKE MYSELF LOOK THREATENING
SUDDENLY, HE IS TINY IS TINY

Dev Patel needs moar good movies >_<
Aang: "I need an adult!"
Village is ice
I AM AN ADULT!
Sure lets burn the igloos
well that was easy
Also, What's up #bronystate?
The acting is even worse than I heard. How is this possible?
Jesse Mcartney. Not even joking.
"We should take this movie, and stream it somewhere else!"
"Melt dowm the village."
ya
aang = spike
I saw... it does get worse
Slow down movie
Imagine, Jesse McCartney playing fucking Zuko
I'd kill them all. The women, and the children too! I'd slaughter them like animals!
caause he's little
Sakka = Twilight
Details, details. :P
Aaaand just like that I have to go...
2,14 I'd rather it go fast...that means it's over fast :P
sky bison
This is the point where I turned this movie off.
AND WHEN DID THE WOOKIES JOIN IN THIS FILM!
07,01why did you pick this again? :)
See ya later #bronystate!
dat cgi
whyyyyyy
when they couldn't even get fucking Appa to look right.
Good point Val
This movie is like Dragonball Evolution
Wait, where was he when the soldiers came in?
Actually from one of the interviews on WQD, someone said the season was only half done when episode 1 was shown.
THE FUCK
dat grip
lolwut
gah even Apa looks WRONH
OMFG Is wrong with Appa
At least they got Dee Bradly Baker
07,01oh my..
How can they act this badly and not do it on purpose? Did they drug these people before they went on?
skybison ftw
is that Iroh?
07,01I was soooo looking forward to it!
EQD*
>put movie on 2x speed

Stupid movie

But the halloween episode would probably only be shown on the 22nd even if the whole season was ready
aha
THE FIRST TIME I DISCOVERED YOU WERE A BENDER
LOOOOOOOOOOL
since it IS a halloween episode after all
AHAHAHA
XDDDDD dari
omg this film has a plot?
SHE'S A BENDER!
Dari, we get it
/me sad that Shamylan didnt actualy watch the show
I GET IT!
Quickly, To the north pole!
Dat foreshadowing
No effort at all in trying to make sure the actors know their own characters' names. Hmm...
only the adults are good acting
Good grief. This movie is literally uncomfortable to watch.
DEM SICK TATS
air bending, eh?
>implying they'll have more than one film
EXPOSITION!
GASP
Eeroh? Ahng? Arvatar?
Hey look, it's Aunt May.

BENDER BENDER!
I dont know what's worse, the wooden acting or the bad pacing
Metalbender?

The acting angers me more
fuck it's I'll pronounce it Larvitar
from futurama
they should just play the cartoons
Dwarf14: it's the combination of all the terrible things
Bendception
Is it bad that I missed ~15 minutes of the start and feel like gouging my eyes out?
I am a Benderbender
Aang was a benderbender
wow
no
Just because I'm watching it now
/me covers Diftraku's eyes
No gouging.
Then you'll never see me again :D

It never happened.
at least Gran-Gran isn't terrible
The camera shots are terrible, the plot building, the characterization, the acting, the pacing, the casting, the action, on and on goes a long list of terrible things.
Mine skeeps pausing
NOT SOMETHING WITH SPIRITS
No but her lines aren't even close
07,01hey everyone :)
He lights candles with his mind.
aww clean that up
yyyeaaaah
Iroh looks like a douche
I dont remeber any of this from the anime
Aang knows the force!!
Zuko acts like a wooden douce
If it's not unconcious, then that means Aang's just showing off. He can't be that dumb, right?
Me neither
douch*
douche*
Problem, Aang?
POTATOBENDING
I dont recall that in the cartoon
Wow, that's some great coreography right there.
should i just turn this off and go find the anime version?
Don't try to escape! *he tries to escape*
gogog
lol its not trying if you know you can do it
YOU BEST BE FUCKING KIDDING ME
I t would be less pa9nful
UNNEEDED WALL RUN

You guys WANT to see this?
Dangit, they didn't even get to show off Aang's Avatar State.
they should switch the sky bison for rainbow dash
awesome :)
is Aang's voice actor actually trying to sound deeper?
SHOW NOT TELL
the movie would be 20% cooler
Avatar: the last LAGbender
Ungh

Wow. Those quotes
THis is the best clip show ever.

Ahng
Is Katara about to sob?
MOMO
Iroh and Zuko never tested him
it's like watching the abridged version
Momo

They're JUST learning his name?
lolwut
He's not that bad
th monks named me Ungh
ahhh ng
Sorry I can't be here for the movies right now guys, I'm a little busy today.
SuperBannana: You don't want to actually watch this anyway.
Probel in fillydelphia?
Omg. It is zoboomafoo.
Momo doesn't look that bad.
DEDZ!!!1!1
Problem*
I have..... to talk to you!
I remember this from the anime
>100 years
someone is on a killing spree...
Uuhn
why are is tatoos looking like dirt
But wait
Watching this is like watching a badly made abridged series.
Uuhng*
finally some accuarcy
You've been in ice for 100 years, and I figured this out using little to no information.
INB4 AVATAR MODE
Where did you get that information lady
this movie has too many little children
WOw...
everywhere people die
seriously
Where the skulls really necessary?
everywhere people die
Didn't they say he was upset about something in the South Pole?
Ohey! Skulls!
The movie is being accurate? We must fix that!
I assume they meant this type deal
I mean that literally
our internnenets dont like us
how bad is it
well the skulls were in the anime too i think
crazy time
The cartoon didn't need them though
everywhere people die
Oh
Okay
....did they died?
It does
You see the ruins and you figure it out
right thats it
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Racebending at its best

There's not enough emotion on his face.

Skeletons! You know for kids!
Suddenly, shroom-induced delusion
random spirt word?
And this. WHY did they not include Roku?
I don't think this happened
Damn. I can't make fun of the movie if I can't watch it!

Or it might have
WHERE IS ROKU?!

rather than actual SHOW the avatar state
UNGH!
Its been awhile since I saw the show
THEY GAVE AVATAR TO SHYMALAN?
07,01I do now
I know

Even if Shyamalan didn't watch the series, Why didn't the actors at least watch it?
there's NOT enough emotion in this film
my connection is terrrible

UHNG
Avatar was totally fantasy, a weird fantastical world, yet at the same time completely believable because it had consistent rules, that were logical and made sense.
2,14 considering everyone is getting it
Boy or girl?
Here you have things like "why don't they just put out the fires?"
I remember theres a very illogical part coming up in the movie
07,01treees hurt?
Is....the most obnoxious insulting scene in the movie
poor pansy
ow
Is VLC still working?

poor you
that little kids? that's meant to be Haru

AND THEY ARE STILL WINNING THE WAR!!!
That's like trapping Waterbenders in an aquarium.
The Sixth Sense was a pretty good movie, surely this can't be too bad
lol
HERE IT COMES. THE WORST. SCENE. EVER. FILMED.
lol
XD
They imprison the earth benders on the one thing they and only they can use!
inb4 DANCEBENDING
TERRIBLE SPEECH
you don't need live like this
THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE PLOTHOLE AANG
wat
now the earth benders are just pussys
dirt
here?
In the anime they imprisoned them on a metal ship out in the ocean
NAH
07,01you do?
THey need to use the torches
I leave for a minute and we're already at the Earth Nation?
i call BS, he doesnt have blue skin
Yet noone puts out those torches when they fight.
looks like they stuffed the whole damn series into one movie
IT'S RIGHT THERE
nope.avi
All one shot
that is pretty goddamn stupid
shamylan failed when he did this
AND THIS IS NOT HOW YOU SHOOT AN ACTION SCENE
seeing as theres air everywhere
that firebending looks STUPID
slow motion replay
oh waity
....
nice skip
that...
also
that hurt
This looks like a high school play
HERE IT IS
fight scene = make it slow as fuck
If you think it's lagging, refresh the page, it's completely smooth.
Just put out the cauldron and they loose
REMEMBER PEOPLE, BENDING HERE IS DANCING, THEN THE ACTION HAPPENS
6
no, it's not lagging.
WAT
:D
this bending is not remotely good looking
06Slow motion. . .
No, I'm in high school. I've been in plays batter than this
oh my
the scene really is going this slow
That dancing
And he just stands there, taking it.
/me weeps bitterly
HAHAHA
High School Musical + Bending?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
wat
And then they won
WHOA, epic skip
High School Bender
6LOL LOTR MUSIC
missed half the battle
I dont blame you
That was the most half-assed fight scene I've ever seen.
NO THEY DIDN
06ohmy this movie. . .
that was the shittest thing i have ever seen
*T
It got cut
Hey guys.
That scroll was stolen from pirates, you liars!
Wait. Waitwaitwait. . .wait. That was a fight scene?
YES
yes it was angry dancing
that's how they fight
SHE IS NOT SUPPOST TO HAVE THIS!
Its a good thing you're not watching
Yeah
He was great
Where are the vikings?
And felt kinda sorry for him
WHERE IS SUKI?
Since he couldn;t bend and all
also, NO SUKI. YOU FAIL MOVIE.
THEY DONT LEARN ABOUT THIS AVATAR UNTILL MONTHS LATER!
...
BULLSHIT!!!!!
He also actually had a personality
/me sighs
KIOSHI WAS A FUCKING AIRBENDER JACKASSES!!!
erm
off
kioshi? where?
ahhhhvatar
Like his intellence
:P
ROKU HAD A CHILDREN!
XD
For some reason, I get the feeling that this movie isn't keeping in line with the anime...
AAH VAH TAR
She was from Earth Kingdom. You're thinking of Yangchen
no, she's an earth bender
He was a great planner, good with tactics and even a decent inventor
Lol, I just called it an anime.
Fillages
Also
Yep
meh i cant find a good utube
x3
/me failed.
i always call it anime
Yangchen was air
IDEA GUYS HAS AT LEAST IDEAS
not an anime
Anakin's got a sound plan.
Kioshi was a previous Avatar.
....
I have never seen the anime, but I hear it is a good anime
seeing as the moive is just book 1
She was earth/fire/water/airbender.
The episode where the learns swordfighting was sooo good.
GRATUITOUS CLOSEUP
/me 6has seen the anime at least five times over
take 1 minute for fight scene
It goes: Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kurruk, Yangchen
mfw when people call this an anime.
anime= japanese animation
:\
you need a montage!
spend 5 minutes to decide to go to the North Pole
*he
Sixth Sense was a good movie :)
i go by mine
If you can call it an anime, It doesn't follow anime tropes very closely.
The next avatar in the cycle is Korra
:P
Like 6th Sense and Unbreakable
AANG WAS A NATURAL IN WATERBENDING
Waaaaaaaateeeeer~
KATARA HAD PROBLEMS
Um...no
aww ok
Probably why she doesn't show up, she'd be embarrased by their all-encompassing pansiness.
this movie needs moar shipping
Unbreakable was amazing
dat skip
It came natural to him.
And the goddamn narrating
he's a damn progidi in the show
WE GET IT
AND NOW WE'RE HERE
HERE

Hush, Bethesda's lawyers might hear

but he found the Libary before they did
sOOhak?

His name is never stated therefore, I can say he isn't Ozai
ZHAO'S NAME WAS PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY!!
LOL
Erm... wasn't the bending world inhabited predominately by people of Aisan ethnicity?
"My Son"
That's Ozai
Julius Ceasar? Is that you?
Fuck you, Shamalan
Much to Katara's initial annoyance ^_^

...You don't think a Pornstache exists?
Its been way too long since I watched the show
Curse these flashbacks!

The casting is shit, the voice acting is shit, the choreographers are shit, this movie must be fertalizer. Anyone try buring it in their gardens?
I mean this *twirls porn stash*
They're all good in their own special ways, I just prefer Nicholson

Gah, That is a shit CGI
Did they even tell us Appa's name?
Appa, yipyip

It made Aang special, you know?
07,01hmm?
I wouldn't call it 'good'

OHNG
I just shivered,
CGI isn't something to brag about anymore
inb4 shoved in romance

Yeah
His arrow on his head is total shit

They went to get some tea. Their feet got cold.
thankke dari
Why does everyone care about Aang then?
11They're doing some kind of Transformers meets Battlship thing for it. IT's fucking stupid.
lol
8,4Something crazy like this?
The next thing you know, they'll make movies based on Connect 4, Chess, and Checkers
Its suppose to be BOLD BLUE...not with fucking random drawings for it
Zuko, why are you narrarating to an unconscious bald brat?
Aang? Yeah
Oh I remember this part!
Ong just sucks
Yes
Use the force, Aang
07,01for instance

The real twist would be if this movie suddenly got good.
I'll stick with those colors lol
11Barry: they already made a movie based on Chess. It's called Braveheart :P
who's voice is this
He's baked
07,01nooo
Steal his face!
Well... I thought I did...

Oh, you guys want to hear something good?
Where's Ahng's previous avatar self?
Can you honestly tell the difference in acting though?
Hey Ggala, When do you want to play arcanists again
Tolvler: Can you blame him?
It's telepathy. I think.
KOH, Y U NO IN THIS MOVIE?
There are going to be TWO MORE MOVIES.
How about a movie based on mouse trap
PUSH THAT MOTHERFUCKER OUT THE WINDOW
It has dragons
That's right
Or tic tac toe
and blue filters
IT'S A TRILOGY.
EMO MONOLOUGE
How did he possibly get ggreenlit after this?
Still they were pronouncing a name that has two consecutive "A"'s wrong
Wait, why are they in a house?
WAIT WAIT WAIT..... MORE ARE COMING?
And Twilight forrests

Bay's The Island was passable
stupid zukko
lol
Faust also worked on "Cats Don't Dance" and "Quest for Camelot"
i is behind you
... Luna?
Along with Fosters home(She wrote all the episodes)
Zuko, you are a firebender. BURN EVERYTHING
That scene was in an earlier part of the series in the show
Even the mainchar makes no sense
Soka's GF x3
SHE'S NOT PROUD OF QUEST FOR CAMELOT
Quest of Camelot?! .....well we all make mistakes
/me fucking loves Quest for Camelot.
LOL
ugh, cant get stream to work
why is he trying to do that and then tries to run away?
i hope there's an explanation for why they pronounce their names that way
In the movie he can't firebend without a source
lol hes beating up a kid
Come on, stop trying to hit me and hit me
Just pick the cheeky bastard up Zuko.
Quest for Camelot COULD have been good, but the studio cut it to shit.
UHNG! Y U NO BEND?!
i like pony
It's beause Shyamalan wanted to use the more asian pronunciations
well done MantisToboggan
EIP was best filler ep
THE MAIN CHARACTER
SHE WAS PATHETIC
I like how Ktara is just walking calmly throught he warzone
In the movie he can't. Only the strongest firebenders can
>More Asian pronunciations
>Mostly Indian actors
CRY
every bender is horrible in this movie
yeah it was awesome
And enjoy the show
ungh
Yup
tbh Avatar lacks much filler
it allgets wraped uo to meaning something more or less
douse the lamps and torches?
Splooge, wait 'til you win the lottery.
even the play and beach episodes
I remember this battle being a lot more epic when I was a kid...
NEVER

Why aren't the spirits guarded?

No, because the spirits are IDIOTS
YOU JUST STAND THERE WATCHING

PAY NO ATTENTION TOT THE AVATAR
SLOW-MO
and here's the ONE good fight scene
Thy are just dancing.
EEROH KILLS A GIRL
having a wonderful time
do it for luna
The cartoon showed that bending wasn't just used for fighting. It was also used for building, healing, repairing, nurturing, even entertainment. The movie shows none of that.
INB4 BELIEVE SPEECH
Does that girl die in the show too?
inb4 Anakin cries
bye hot white-haired chick!
YES
yes
inb4 scene that seems sad but its not
Because all those things would take time away from horrible acting
SURVIVE!
Luna > annoying padme knockoff
and narration
Yui becomes the moon
More prequel flashbacks
By... dying, or something.
we believe in our beliefs
Zuko: That's rough man...
Not kind of, she does
Zuko: That's rough, buddy.
that's rough buddy
Good bye girlfriend 1
SHE USED "BELIEVE" 3 TIMES
YEAH! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!
That scene looks like it is ripped from the newer starwars movies
She banishes herself to the moon
which is sad
He was dating a moon
SokaXLuna fic GO!
Where the girlis the moon or something.
KICK! PUNCH! IT'S ALL IN THE MIND!
TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAAAHHHH BEYETCH!!!
"Kthxbai
AND LUNA IS REVIVED
She is going TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAHHHHHH!!!!
07,01yay
Is it bad that anakin and padme has more emotion then this?
AMG LUNA
I prefer the starwars prequels to this
Not how that was supposed to happen but ok
And the vampires are impotent once again.
Well at least they were starwars..
8o
Yesterday was the same I think
I enjoy how the battle stops just to look at the moon.
>8o
No
NOT YET
good music
Nearly there, though
WE ARE BEFORE OHNG PWNS THE FIRENUBS
yeah no Pony
makes people meh
Imagine the lightsaber duels going as slow as the bending.
Nice stance.

Alright, here we go, the fight between Zuko and Zhao...

He was eaten by the blob!
I can't get the stream to start up :/
And then they drowned him
Back to you... Jon *dies*
Go to Veemi
wut
and here's the one decent action setpiece in this whole thing
SLOW MOTION
Well the figure skating is here for comic relief
wtf
best scene in the movie
???
unless i guess it was mainly providing an outlet for all that pent up energy between seasons and is less massive now with s2
ok, for some reason the stream wont work, anyone else having this problem?
Yep..And it just ended star.\
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
Badumpsh
Yeah, guess that could be it
THEY DON'T DO KOIZILLA!!!

Isn't this about the point where Aang turns into Fishzilla?
2,14 you should see #rarity :P
Around here
07,01amw watching it ;)
flashbacks only depress me when I channel them.
I dun geddit
Oh and I guess that school starting for various people could play a part in it
OH BOY MORE EXPOSISITION
GGgala, When do you want to play arcanists though?

MY BACKSTORY IS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAP
06ohmy
Wait
Well...that backstory was pointless
Alright, Can i see the news image?
It'll be on in 10 minutes, I think
he remembers his failure? how does that help him?
alright I gotta admit the Rifftrax is pretty great
Ung, y u no Avatar State?
Exactly.
07,014 team-members in Rarity and 2 viewers :D
bracing for Koizilla
UHNG USES SURFER!!!
there's the avatar state for 5 seconds
....magic?
Aang, use Surf!
And the tidal wave crushes the city of the waterbenders. The End.
Rifftrax is ok, but you need to watch The Room in order to get half the jokes.
OHSHI-
that sucks
This battle uses the same logic that other Avatar movie used
NOT IN THIS MOVIE
It didn't make it into the film
Namely, noone has ever heard of long range bombardments.
HUMANS ARE EVIL?
that's right
Pppfffffttttt...... Demyx reference? x3
even if it's not a school night still, busier
thanks whoever posted that backup link
Uhng uses intimidate!
appreciate it
11Tovler: Wrong movie adaptation
Well I liked the other Avatar movie far more then this.
avatar needs more guns i guess
Koizilla was the only scene of the show that I was looking forward to, and it doesn't even make it into the effing film...
Demyx reference was relevant
You know, they also had a scene filmed with the Kyoshi Warriors, but cut it.
Gotta give the music an A for effort
Why do all the Firebenders look like they're in an ancient Persian army?
And now, think about this:
i wish the humans won too
and now we wait
How did the humans NOT win?
pussy
Yeah
UHNG?
OHNG!
Aang isn't supposed to HURT PEOPLE
Ong Bak?
Don't they haver tanks in the future?
Oh, you've got a point.
>_>
*SHAHAKHAKHAKHKKKHASAK
should be jobless
I don't care HOW valuable that floaty unobtainium was
and out of education like me
lots of time
not much money
Come on Aang, you should at least let the wave crush them all
stream won't start for me :/
And that's how equestria was made.
Not after they saw Koizilla
what's next?
Watership down.
man, I can't wait for Legend of Korra
Meh
UHNG?
it's about bunnies that kill each other
I don't
Hey look, none of the waterbenders are injured.
Thank Celestia. -___-
Not a single casualty!
I can, there's too many games and tv shows on right now. Play Korra when nothing is on TV
They should now end with a narration
about bunnies
"I'm never going to have a career after this film, am I?"
IT'S OVER
Is he crying?
and then they all fucked. The End
END IT ALREADY
07,01FINISH IT!
>his face when he realized this is the biggest role he'll ever get
07,01Noooo

F***K THIS MOVIE
read this comic before watching Watership DOwn: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1d_thQV_AY/Tm_ZEUT7ZvI/AAAAAAAAAW0/sXdBamFxYno/s1600/FWC+-+Fluttership+Down+-+Bigger.jpg
11I JUST GAVE YOU THE ONE MOVIE THAT'S *WORSE* THAN BABES IN TOYLAND AND SPIDERS WEB
1.5, like a baws
oh tension is gone ang can sit on a beach for a year
Maybe he hated the fans of the series.
if he wanted to now...
;P
It's good if you don't read the book.
how bad was spider's web?
LAWL
I'm curious... was this movie chosen intentionally because of its badness?
Really bad
This movie was at least shorter than Babes in Toyland.
*babes
Yup core...Just like how the shitty ponies movie was chosen.
DONT JOKE ABOUT THAT
/me feels his brain has failed just watching the last five minutes
MEE
Ok.
When it comes out on DVD, we should watch "Abducted". It' got an even lower Rotten Tomatoes score.
I liked Babes when it was 94 minutes long.
pfft, at least they had the foresight to realize their shitty actors would age
nah smurfs
like, I wouldn't mind watching this again instead of Babes in Toyland
Well, next up is Watership Down...
07,01this movie...
lol
!
The sound of fairies dying.
Abducted was just mediocre, not roflbad
That was a ping
not like they need that...
i saw watership down when I was 6
FTW!
07,01Alright

I'll skip this one as well :P

I am surprised the credits even exist, if I was part in that movie I would forbit someone putting me into the credits.
Fix it Dari!
Watership Down is awesome

Don't everypony pile in at once...
