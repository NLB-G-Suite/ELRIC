pony!!
7/10
:P/10
me too whirlybird
that was the B movie, right?
It wasn't great, but not bad. The music scenes kinda dragged it down for me, they really didn't contribute much of anything except extra film length.
05,156/10 I didn't pay attention to the movie at all
DAT MATT DAMON
wow
Wrek: That is good news!
PONYTIME -grabs pinkie, places her near theatre screen, and tosses fluttershy a juicebox- this is our moment

revenge of the nerds is solid
My verdict: par for the course as Don Bluth films go, mediocre at best as a space movie. 5/10
0,14also, LOOOOL, Janeane Garofalo

drew barrymore?
And TONE-LOC
i did not notice that was nathane lane 0.0

jim cummings has got to be worth at least 300 million
fun fact :Because Titan A.E. didn't do well at the box-office, 20th Century Fox closed its animation studios in Arizona after only two feature films, the first being Anastasia. Fox then contacted Blue Sky studios to produce animated films using 3D computer graphics such as Ice Age and Robots.

Revenge of the Nerds I think
PINKIE PIE
Battle Cymbals!
05,15it's pretty good. in my opinion
poof
Rainbow Dash can control the weather, bu never gets a chance to use that power
where did scott pilgrim come from with those symbols?
damn that's dangerous
I used to think baby chickens were cute until I got a job at a hatchery I get annoyed everytime I look at one now
I have a quick question: How good a movie is Revenge of the Nerds from 1 to 10 where 1 is "okay" 10 is "Worth staying up all night for" and 2-9 are there becasue they are nice numbers and they don't hurt anyone?
/me eats the sandvich at the bottom of the bin and multiplies until it explodes
Nope
ooooh dat hurt
i have skyrim and i still like oblivion
Uh oh
seriously that's like a pony final destination right there
I used to be best pony, then I took an arrow to the knee
Skyrim and oblivion are both good
Doomed, were all doomed!

I'm not a Gipsy
brand new pair -> implying she just bought them -> implying there's a music store
I have gotten bored of the Bethesda franchise

Lunaughty?
Hey Roxsnow!~
The princess demands it!
ok luna i promise.

NOW I'LL NEVER GO TO BED
Ictiv, not gonna play Organ trail?
really, im wrapped in my duvet

Aperently derpy exploded twice
Luna y u must stalk me
Shizuka: agreed
"I exploded twice once"
Hello Athena : o
/me goes to bed
It's 20:00, why would I go to bed?

I don't get the hype around District 9
NLR

i am never normal
9 PM here
KernelCobb: Yeah, they need to give them a test, to see how high their morality rate is. And if the test finds that they're an upstanding citizen, then they're not worthy of the internet's bounty.
Scoot-Scootaloo which avatar?
Scoot-Scootaloo: It wasn't all that
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: i loved Avatar because it was pretty and had hot aliens
It was OK, but people play it up like something amazing
Meanwhile! My main man!

Mustache!
Oh, ok she's gone
The Last Airbender

08,01i watched The Last Airbender last night; it wasn't a horrible film, it just didn't live up to any expectations i had of it
#Pinkie_Pie

i like trains
Avatar was pretty bad.
StinkomanFan yesh
Is it a confused frog, because maybe
08,01the fights were terrible
Oh well...that picture was weird...
and I'm too poor for bf3
1,3:p
shhh
otakon: YOU lie

Sure, Shizuka, just keep saying that
It might be the issue Ponyfan78. Hasbro hasn't said yet, so we cant really assume anything. Remember that.

I think it's sad that they don't know the term Derp isn't slang for retarded, but for when you do something stupid that can be funny
13and i am forever sad for it
I'll join the fight StinkomanFan
yay!
08,01but it was just a big meh fest
Evil Dead II was awesome.
