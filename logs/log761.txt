MadSurge: I dont remember talking about the beatles...
/me glomps Deacon, then says the following rapidly "How are you? I'm good, thanks for asking. Have you heard of the Beatles? I like them. They're hippies. My brother hates the hippies, but he likes guns. War, he also likes war. World War 1 and 2 were unneeded, but it made guns. I like nachoes."
XD
O_o
Wall
DoctoDoctorWho: well, these in the video are all Beatles songs :D
/me is glomped with words :O
MadSurge: ah, I see.
war.war never changes
Gold_Demona: my dad loves the Beatles :)

NewDCD: Omg I have never seen you before and I know everymod, and I mean everymod on bronystate! So if I have never seen you before that must mean your new! And if your new then you must not have any friends and that makes me sooo sad so Im gonna be your friend now! YaY!
NewDCD: MUDA DA "D
*:D
anthology 2 anyone?
09,01actually
lol
DoctoDoctorWho: He's one of the oldest mods here~
09,01I'm the remaining founder of the site
^
09,01so I'm technically the oldest mod
by old I mean he's been here the longest
09,01LOL.
12WHOO!
NewDCD: What tooks you so long after Fire Emblem?
NewDCD: you just don't come here often
09,01I'm just kind of a busybody yeah
NewDCD: Oh, well I've never seen you before so Hi!
chat derped
DemoPegono: ...Do we known you?
what happened to the other founders
09,01lame existentialist crisis that's what
00I'm sorry.
DemoPegono: Ive never seen you before either!
09,01or rather, my 3DS is so close yet so far so I've been feeling pretty meh ;__;
They left for reasons in life or sumthin'.
DoctoDoctorWho: naw, he isnt a mod
00Do I use black or white then?
i've never seen you here NewDCD, so let me say hello! it's nice to meet you!
oh, okay.
The kick script derped. DemoPegono was supposed to be kicked instantly for colors. Why did he have to be kicked manually?
DemoPegono it was blue
00I know I know.
@NewDCD what happened to the other founders, im curious
NewDCD: Hi! I'm Scoot-Scootaloo!
or you could tell hi mthat colours are for mods only
Kandarihu I think that was mostly sumicabot's job, and it's not here
vidmaster4694: They went to the moon
He killed them and absorbed their power
00But should I use black or white? 
oh nooooo
Deacon, oh, I see.
NewDCD: Of all the streams that I loved...It camed down to Shizuka/Sumica, but then I seen your Fire Emblem stream, and my opinions are BLOWN outta' the window!
09,01we were two guys. He had the idea, I had the knowledge and techniques to stream
DemoPegono: Ultrawhite
00... okay.
^^
09,01basically he was too busy for BronyState after a while
one Hipster_Brony was his name
that makes sense
Sumica is still in the middle of upgrading his OS.
NewDCD: thanks for making the site <3 this place is awesome
I'm off to bed mates. 3am 'er
00,00I think I'm blind... yeah... I can't see my words.
I blame Planetside 2
...
09,01I didn't do much, I just knew how to stream
dat ultra white
oh no run, it's mine turtle
DemoPegono: ...What?
09,01incidentally
nighty TheRandomkid321
09,01you just reminded me I gotta get a new casing for my PSP
09,01and stream some Ace Combat again
00,00I'm using white! I'm using white!
[11:43:33] <DemoPegono> I think I'm blind... yeah... I can't see my words.
Bye, DemoPegono
DemoPegono: change it
If anyone can read the ultra white message, I worship you as Jesus!
09,01because above being a strategist, I'm an Ace of Aces : 3
[11:44:07] <DemoPegono> I'm using white! I'm using white!

DemoPegono, you're gonna get banned if you keep this up
NewDCD: You make use of strategy?
vidmaster4694: dont do it :D
09,01colors are for moderation staff only
YOU DON'T COLOURS IS FOR MODS ONLY
jsut wanted to know...
vidmaster4694: Well fisrt, you have to be a moderator...
ok
I KNOW IKNOW!
vidmaster4694: don't. It's only for mods!
09,01this is because it makes mods easier to see and heed their warnings
i get it
here comes the sun lalalala!
Except me, for some reason...
/me wishes he could be a mod
/me but can only wish
caus eyou to poor for clothes :P
its okay Scoot-Scootaloo, colors are overrated anyway :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: you just wanted to go streaking, didnt you :I
true dat
Okay... LightIRC is not a good choice for this chat.
09,01scoots this ain't Saints Row
Wrek: Scoots isn't wearing clothes again
09,01you ain't gonna get an unlockable for streaking
09,01yo'll just get arrested
...damn...
NewDCD should deffinetly come up with the idea to play EVERY SINGLE MARIO GAMES EVER.
Yes, even Hotel Mario.
NewDCD: You're a strategist?
What's streaking?
even mario is missing?
Yes.
and Mario is Missing, but the SNES Version :)
i'm downloading planetside 2, even though i'm certain my computer can't handle it. fuck logic
Pegono|BlueLantern: running while Nekkid
i find strategy is the best option
And Mario Teaches Typing.
... oh.
the end, such a lovely song
Hello Lil_B :)
hai thar MadSurge :)
VenHur actually that one was fun
the Beatles are the Best Rolling Stones :P
People are saying that One Direction are the new Beatles WTF.
Booping...
Who the hell is One Direction?
I dunno.
Its this really annoying band that like, every teenage girl likes..
Lasharus, some popular band now.
And their songs are ANNOYING.
Ahh.
One Directions... thats one streight name...
Random popularity.
Bye everypony
One Direction*
Bye BroPony|MEDIC :)
That one didn't go down very well, if memory serves :P
...
NewDCD: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8418/
Lasharus, something to that effect.
Lasharus they never said that, somebody wrote in in a Newspaper or something like that
Ah, fair enough.
The lyrics to one of One Direction's songs are:
Lil_B, oh. Okay. That makes sense too.
But anyway, calling a band "the next Beatles" is a statement that requires one HELL of a lot of qualification. :P
I wish I could find a way to get XChat (especially my varient, HexChat) to display the privilege markings before users name in the text box.
SO GET OUT GET OUT GET OUTTA MY HEAD AND FALL INTO MY ARMS INSTEAD!
I DONT I DONT KNOW KNOW WHAT IT IS! BUT I NEED THAT ONE THING!!

Looks like my Saturday nights :P

Sandwich*
Ponies! Nah horses
If twinkies went out, could another company get the formula and start making them?
DoctoDoctorWho: The world may never know.
Hi everypony
Someone posted the recipe for twinkies on the internet
Make them yourself?
My mom said that the company that makes Twinkies is shutting down forever..
DinkyDoo: cuz I just might do that

Shutting down?! TWINKIES?!
My mom said that the company that makes Twinkies is shutting down forever..
Yep
VenHur: eeyup
Hostess

eeyup
She said that their going to be gone..
/me In pinkie pie voice

Worse than Krispee Kreem closing in my area
You guys will have to settle for Little Debbie's Twinkie clone if you can find them
Kandarihu: Twinkies postet the recipie on the wrapper, like every other food production company does, :|
Little Debbie > Hostess

DinkyDoo: they went bankrupt in the u.s. they're still going in other places
In :O voice: POREVER
So what will we do when the zombies come out and there are no more twinkies?
RDash5000: Oh.
POREVER = FOREVER
I live in the us..
DinkyDoo: so go to Canada :)
WAIT

Hi HavokOC
Hello everypony
Hi pyrocatboy_school :)

I'm sorry. I never really was. I liked the techno music of the NES and the Sega Genisis when I was a kid. VenHur
<=== I wonder if Bronycon could match this...

Well...yeah, I liked video game music too, AJfan77.
STOP THE SCREAMING! GAAAAAAAAAAAGH

Why are we watching the beetles? xD
Tervicz: Let's face it, maybe the show is about as pouplar in the range of Beatles's popularity.
how are things rahl_zuniga
Sprunkls :3
tehlonpot :3
Fav game of all time is Sonic 2 because of gameplay and music VenHur :)
/me noms on sprunkls :3

How ya been twilight_sprinkle :D
I don't know...Sonic 2 has to be the most overrated Sonic game...
I'm anticipating some early morning ponies. :3
<=== The voiceactors in pony costume singing winter wrap-up ;)
Yo whats up bronystate hows it going?
Personally, Sonic 3 and Knuckles is THE best Sonic game ever to me.
thelonepony: well, i just started my vacation with a morning dentist appointment, EET WUZ GREAT
08,01i need caffeine
Hi Moopy :)
08,01i'm falling asleep at my compuuter
twilight_sprinkle: :D
hoi Moopy
rahl_zuniga: There were some really early morning ponies today, Sumi streamed the three Season 3 eps at like 4 AM
And it dang well deserves it. SA2Battle is REALLY overrated
hello
08,01and i now only have 7 hours to write this garbage collector
VenHur: Top three Sonics for me: S3&K, SA1, Generations
J_E_Smith71 not THAT early. :D
What a movies playing. I didn't notice.
clap your hands, stomp your feet, and yell like a building is falling on you
J_E_Smith71, do you have them all on Steam? Because they're all on Steam
AJfan77: This Friday? Roger Rabbit and Hulk Vs
twilight_sprinkle: What you have to realise is that NOTHING like this had ever been seen before. The Beatles literally created the fangirl in ways even Elvis et al never dreamed of.
Wait.... someone asked for ponies?!
Kandarihu: Nope, don't need them. Have S3&K on Wii VC and DS Collection, have both PS3 & 3DS versions of Generations, have SADX
J_E_Smith71 : My bucked up phone says Wednesday
Scoot-Scootaloo: It wasn't me. >_>
Kencolt: yeah, its funny thugh that they took some of his songs
Scoot-Scootaloo: I DEMAND PONIES. G4, NOTHING ELSE!
Make a Beatles video into a band called the Ponies.
wait, what ponies? >_>
Where are the ponies? :c
<_<
twilight_sprinkle: Not really-- covers were done all the time. And it's mostly their original songs that mesmerised the pops.
never ask for these ponies <_<
Kencolt: hey jude, one of their bests ever, was an elvis song
:) ;) :P <3
twilight_sprinkle: Watch out, I showed Sumi a new video to show if people ask for ponies that's as bad as G3 live show. Don't know if Scoot has it though
AJfan77: There is a project to ponify almost every beatles song ever-- it's on Youtube, IIRC.
Kencolt ....why...
J_E_Smith71: I didn't, but I would love to see it...
Deacon: Hey-- they are mostly very well done.
i heard those pony beatle songs,not on youtube though, they are tolerable
OMFG I'M TOTALLY BUCKING WATCHING THAT BUCKING SHIT. LATER!
well, ok then, but still....
Ponies that's as bad as The World's Biggest Tea Party?!
Oh god, it better not be MLP FiM Live!
>_> I didn't ask for ponies <_<
i did :>
WHERE ARE MAI PONIES
I WANT PONIIS, NAAAO
:>
The ponies are on the moon during the week
So how many of you saw the College Humer Video My little Brony
twilight_sprinkle: can you at least go look them up on youtube for your selfs?
I didn't ask for ponies. >_>
Moopy: NOOO, THEY MUST BE HERE, GIMME POONIES
Moopy: he's trying to see what scoots is up too :D
AJfan77, I saw as much of it as I could stand. Clearly College Humor hates bronies as much as they hate conservatives.
with the ponies
Why are we watching the beetles?
HMPH
why not? :3
im not trying to see what scoots is up to, im just trying to end up torturing chat :>
Because they're the most legendary boyband of the 50s!
Because, ponies.
They are!
Beatles. You can at least spell it right.
beetuls
Oh u twilight_sprinkle :D
Sorry.
Because they're almost all dead?
:c
say Kencolt are you british?
Because they practically redefined rock and-- in a very real sense-- music for that generation. Of which I am a part.
Ineed, they did.
rahl_zuniga: Because spiderman.mp4
twilight_sprinkle: No. I'm 55. I was THERE.
Indeed*
Best Beatle Pony?
Scoot-Scootaloo wat
that i know Kencolt
And that Paul, one of The Beatles band members, still lives.
rahl_zuniga: http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs6/3516709_o.gif
Ok Bronies. Pause this video and watch this video and dislike with all your heart because I did that is If you have a youtube account if you don't get one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wougfalXBQY
...
no video links during stream
Nah, the Beatles are cool. They loved and tolerated before it was cool.
and yet they couldnt love and tolerate each other..
Ok Why did i got kicked out. It was an anti brony video with this gut killing a brony
no video links during stream
:>
:'(
AJfan77: One, because no video links during stream. And Two, we don't give a fuck what people think!
^
yeah!
I guess I'll just shut up
so many fangirls
Fuck people's opinions.
that was random
nah you're cool AJfan77, just try not to command people
and they're immature Kids you know :>
AJfan77

:O
I wanna hold your cash
good. thanks RDash5000
Million Dollar Question: Who has more fangirls the Beatles or Sonic the Hedgehog
is that a trick question?
AJfan77: CHUCK NORRIS!
Remember, if you want to be popular, use a hairstyle like that, cause chicks dig it for no reason!
^
^^
VenHur the accent also helps alot
My Father still believes that the true reason the Beatles depoarted was because theyx just cound't stand it anymore that their Concerts weren't about Music anymore, becaue the Screaming became so loud that nobody could hear anything anyway + the constand fear of going on the stead on their own an getting ran down by Fans
here take all the Monopoly dollars I have
AJfan77: spike
BRB guys
I still think it's funny that the Beatles became popular after they leaved germany, where they got their famous Hairstyle :P
So how long Beatlemania has lasted anyway? 7 years?
AJfan77: Captain Price
SirGanjalf: To ann extent, it's never really died.
Hell, even Justin Bieber had an hairstyle about tha-
...Heeey, WAIT A SECOND!
morning :)
Biber was only popular because of his GOD DAMN HAIR!
mornin Ryunosuke
I came here for a dancing pony in the corner! i am dissapoint!

Bye RDash5000 :)
bye RDash5000
VenHur no, one direction, the jones brothers and Justin Bieber all have other haristyle... ... wait, they don't ... >.<
swag
Kencolt: I was rather thinking about thousands of squealing fangirls on every concert.
See?! The Beatles-ish hairstyles is the secret of thier popularity.
OK back
man, it would kinda suck having an army of fangirls fowlloing you everywhere
...And I really, really, really, REALLY hates them for that.
Swagestia, when you sayswag 1 more time you land on mah ignore list :)
VenHur made in germany... it gets all around the world :P
Atleast Fangirls are good for excercise
Invi i only said it once
Fangirls can also takes your bike. [inserts Punch Out Theme here]
Swagestia, yeah but it became abnnoying already yesterday
Help1 was the best Beatles move to me. It had music, it had laughs, and it had something apporaching a plot. I loved it.
how so Invi
I can't even tell whos streaming by the way just saying though
Swagestia, make a guess...
conami, that's Sumica's Desktop Pony. He's off upgrading his OS right now. Scoot-Scootaloo is streaming now
Moopy: Does it matter who is streaming, hmm?
Just saying dude.................jeese
probably somepony keeps spamming it right Invi
and my Desktop Pony is WAYY too MLG to be on stream~
IIRC, I think he has his own custom Desktop Pony, right?
DANG IT Scoot-Scootaloo!
Invi has swagphobia
indeed
well, depends on the swag ^^
I do, it's just so MLG, the stream freezes when it appears. It's that awesome.
Scoot-Scootaloo, I see. So you need to get it toned down, then?
I don't NEED it to get toned down, I just don't feel like showing it off~
Scoot-Scootaloo, fair enough
Scoot-Scootaloo: i wanna see now! :o im curious!
Dem Headphones and glasses, must be Hipster

Scoot-Scootaloo: if i got premission to use more propper tools it would have looked more proffessional
oh son of a...
Major: dont tell me, alexxm?
tosh... I dont know what to say
aye

SafariMonkey: its her tail ;-;
thelonepony why is it always me that you accuse
twilight_sprinkle: I'll take diabetes like that any time
twilight_sprinkle: daww
:3
hi. what'S streaming?
yo Dark_Horst
alexxm: i never accuse all the time
Snow|Sick: I know. That was my first thought though. :P
just this once :P
ok thelonepony but why me
accuse you*
twilight_sprinkle, dem eye sparkles
not sure, just a hunch
Kandarihu: yeah they seem to be a popular thing
and last time you tried to change me to a foal :D
john lennon. i knew i'd seen that guy before
Hi Dark_Horst :)
sup
swag
twilight_sprinkle, they help keep the eyes from looking soulless.
hello again
not to be someone that doesnt like to pay for stuff, but does someone know where i can get photoshop for free? just asking.
Snow|Sick torrents I guess?
Hi twilight_sprinkle :>
hey MadSurge :)
ok, i shall try to look for that torrent then i guess :/
how've you been Dark_Horst
if you don't want to pirate, yu can always try GIMP
Hi Dark_Horst !
*you
MadSurge hope you haven't bee neating any turkey early
/me rustles MadSurge awake
alexxm: i bought sation cash. i still dont know how to feel
first time i ever spent money on something free to play. should be worth it though
Dakr_Horst whats station crash
alexxm: planetside 2 premium currency
is it good Dark_Horst?
the game? sure
especially since it's free
in fact
Gimp is a nice <Programm for , you can almost do anything with it, but it's so amazingly annoying to use that I still prefer MS Paint over GIMP
why isnt everybody in here downlaoding it already?
it'S ons team
*Steam
ET ON IT!
Dark_Horst, there's one and only one reason I'm not playing Planetside 2.
Dark_Horst, waitwat?
Dark_Horst: sorry, dont have steam and my computer is shit with games :P
My GPU is below it's minimum
Kandarihu: elaborate
My GPA is higher than my K/D ratio!
Wait... what are we talking about?
1) not that much into shooters (well, this ones does look interresting) 2) My Sythem and Internet connection 3) Won't be on much anyway
Invi: yes. pkanetside 2. that gaem wrek's been streaming. it's good, it's free, it's on steam, go download
Scoot-Scootaloo: Planetside 2
wrek is streaming?
Oh that MLG game?
If your computer can handle it, go ahead and give it a try.
^
Invi: nope, scoots
Scoots is streaming? :O
oh wait
Invi: the one he has been streaming
nvrmind :D
sillieh me :P}
planetside 2 is a fun game to watch IMO, but id like to keep it to borderlands 2 and TF2. sorry D:
Dark_Horst, oooh that one
Snow|Sick: but it'S free. broderlands isnt
Fillies don't know bout mah Halo4
there is absolutely no downside to downloading planetside 2
except 7gb less disk space
Scoot-Scootaloo: We do, we just wish we didn't. Do ho ho
im just not a FPS lover, those are the only 2 i can tolerate D:
OH YOU~
Dark_Horst, has long as your computer can run it
swag
okay, bye Swagestia :)
no
gtfo
:>
sagswagswag
:D
not you sprunkls :D

did i miss a conversation on games? sorry i was drawing...
:P
i'm not going to say it
conami, planetside is for free on steam
*planetside2
ahh
my computer would blow up looking at that :D
I'll try it ^^
i'm running it on a notebook
I'll try running it on mah laptop
gets hot as fuck, lowest settings, but it runs :D
Dark_Horst: :D
Dark_Horst, dreh den swag auf xD
auf 13!
lol
seriously though, one day i gotte get a better fan for this thing
i should clean that thing from dust first...
i suspect the bad cooling is the reason my processer barely goes above 50%
Dark_Horst, maybe dusting will do
it never did
not even the day i bought it
...but dusting should be due anyway
Dark_Horst, that is especially important for laptops
they stuffed this thing full of hardware so it looks good on paper, but in reality it gets slowed down by the cooling
Hi everypony.
Hi DinkyDoo :)
Dark_Horst, that's why it's important to dust that thing from time to time
hai DinkyDoo ^^
how've you been DinkyDoo
XD
Dat fangirl.
still gotta shape up my actual tower
So many people.
it'S crippling slow. could be a virus, could be physical damage, could be dust
could be all of the above
the only thing i'm using my laptop for games is that my actual pc doesnt work right atm xD
*reason
or something built a nest inside of it....
yes... managaed to make a Desktop Pony Run... well... 1 Frame of it at least... >.< soo hard!
Lil_B, run or walk?
Invi runing, it's supposed to be charging with a spear
Lil_B, ooh nice

:D
a pony with a spear, i want it :D
THE BEATLES ARE BEST PONIES.
have to figure out Run-Cycles, magiucal glowing around objects and the floating of a cape in the Wind... never did any of this, and everything frame by frame
the beat alls are best supervillians
Pixel Animation for Gifs, one thing Gimp COULD make really well, but unfortunatly for some reason, everthing fubars if you actually try it
the beat alls? wow
Invi what about them
Lil_B, i tried actualy animation but mine sucked because i can't draw ^^
Invi can you show me what yyou drew?
Lil_B, lol you nmean that animation? lemme see if i can find it again...
I like the way DinkyDoo thinks
Still think Revolution Nr 9 is the best beatles song
Who's streaming Anthology?
Scoots is
:3
Beatles are MLG
ITS JUST A WALL.
if i used that door, id be in the gangnam song
A Doorway that leads to my worst fear!?

Invi: I meant Twilight the movie ^-^
DinkyDoo, Twily has a movie? :O
speaking of tf2...
Invi: No, its a horrible movie that humans made! Its about a vampire, a werewolf, and this girl named Bella.
just asking, but does anyone got a strange huntsman?
Remember when vampires where badass, evil, and not sparkly?
DinkyDoo: she's a human? I thought she was a cardboard cutout!
DinkyDoo, you forgot the fiary

Thanks for the stream Scoot-Scootaloo, one last thing.
KandIsPS2Butthurt pricedrop later, the ammount I will actually use it, the lack of my own TV (at the moment), and the overall price of 404€ to actually get it

Thanks for streaming, Scoot-Scootaloo
...WEAR YOUR COLOR DAMNIT!
thanks for stream
thanks Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Oh, and DAT FORESHADOWING
you don't wanna go on cause your a chicken!
sorry
thanks for streaming
YES! OC REMIX Trailer for the Donkey Kong Country 3 Album has released!
>Get back to pc
>Stream turns off
damnit.
Meanwhile: So it was you.
Aww, did I miss a stream?
Polydunami, yeah. Scoot-Scootaloo was streaming all morning.
>just logged in after a few days away from Bronystate :P
Sumica is off upgrading his OS BTW
Is that Kandarihu?
Polydunami, yes.
Sorry
excuse me while I kiss the sky... I mean switch back to lightIRC ... that was forced...
Something wrong with your PS2 Kand?
ok wats happening
Scoot's stream had ended.
But what?
Is anyone else getting spammed by Swagestia?
no
13report him to #help
i'm not spamming
Kandarihu: Yep, I /ignored him a while back...
No stream?
There was never a stream, streams are just a myth.
...
What meanwhile said
13Oh look, Swagestia is ban evading
What Meanwhile said.
no i'm not
How Shizu?
lying?
13we banned him three days ago from that same ISP
oh
lol
13people that evade bans are typically criminally stupid
They don't exist, like bigfoot, the letter গand free parking.
They must do otherwise there won't br a bronystate
Shizuka: That, or they had an IQ of... 9000,000,00,0.
Bronystate is also a myth.
**would't
Just sayin'.
...
Oh, forgot the minus in there...
Quite an oversight VenHur.
13causing your modem to fetch a new IP from DHCP does not a clever evasion scheme make
Shizuka: Why?
Did I kill the chat?
13because they're still on the same ISP, their username is still the same, and they're typically dense enough to use the same nick or a trivial variation of it
seems like it
The internet is also a myth.
nah. it was already dead
13and then brag about how they're evading
And Bill Gates...
Meanwhile stop, you gonna break the Illusion machine
Invi: Because he's already dead!
hey everpony
Hery everypony*
Meanwhile, the chat is a boy?
ello Serenity
hey Serenity
Hey there, Serenity :)
Hai Serenity :)
Hi Serenity
:)
hay Serenity
i think i broke the internet
Invi: Was referring to Spongebob, but I'm not going to check.
how are things Serenity
'Lo Serenity.
Have some Gabe: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGIsj46BnQU
:>
Shizuka: Sooo, why not just TRY to tell peoples NOT to ban evade?
Shizuka: Well if someone changes his ip and nick, having the same ISP is not enough proof to ban him, isn't that right?
Shizuka, what if they just go by the nick that LightIRC gives them, and just scramble the 4 digits each time?
13Malavolent: no, but then they do stupid things like point out how they're evading, such as by spamming users
Pretty much, yeah.
wait a sec. she/he even got K-lined
Shizuka: Yet the internet can a sad place sometimes...
*be
13eeyup
Sometimes?
^
Sometimes.
Well, I gotta restart my computer. My laptop's manufacturer commands it from on high
Ello Terminusbot :3
I'm getting a new cat sometime this week :3
I forgot to mention
coolio
Because I know how much you all care about my pets.
Serenity, that's nice to hear
Serenity: Oh yeah, speaking of, someone's cat died from an allergy thing...He was 12 in humans years, 86 in cat years.
good evening
ello Alchemist
Hello Alchemist.
Hi Alchemist L)
Hey there, Alchemist :3
:)*
lali-ho Alchemist
I'm pretty much rescueing the cat I'm getting. My fucknut neice I want to murder with every single piece of might I have is constantly choking her, and at one point she threw her down the stairs, and laughed
I thought we were busy streaming planetside 2 :D
13report animal abuse?
That was StuffCrusader who lost his cat
Shizuka: My niece is 1 year old
My dog is almost 14
Serenity: ...Wow...your family's bitches.
13report parental neglect?
Serenity: thats still messed up...
Report ANYTHING?
VenHur: That's the spirit.
Shizuka: According to her mum, she was in her room arsing around, then she heard something fall down the stairs, followed by laughter
One of my two surviving cats (Flurry) was earlier abused by a little girl. She's considerably anti-social and territorial.
But anyway, the crie everytim story is over, because this isn't the place, the point is, I'm getting a kitten.
13unrelated, wow the steam sale is meh
^mmhmm
Kandarihu: ...Wow...girl's a bitch.
VenHur, she was practically a toddler at the time. She knew Flurry as a kitten by the name "Lucy-Pearl"
The first days of a steam sale are usually not that great
/me looks around here, then thinks of the country, the continent, the world.
/me siiiiighs.
It's steam sale time?
yup
Guys, the Wii U acording to my dad will be costed a freaking 5000$!
/me needs to restart his computer but doesn't want to miss out on this convo
twilight_sprinkle: I wonder...
twilight_sprinkle: Does Dark Energy go through 0 Kelvin
Wii U $5000? wut :I
No one who abuses a cat should be allowed to live.
Oh wait, that was wrong...
As much as I hate cats, I agree with Meanwhile
Meanwhile: Noone who abuses anything deserve to get anything
thelonepony, yea according to VenHur's dad $5000
Vordox: i dont quite understand what you mean by go through, but dark energy is only theoretical. you think the conversion of energy to dark energy go through a temperature change through 0?
Vordox: That too.
:I
twilight_sprinkle: No, I've been going through the Big Crunch, Big Rip and Big Freeze.
So, my dad is wrong...
:D
twilight_sprinkle: If it's theoretical, we don't have any answer if Dark energy can travel or "power" through 0 Kelvin...
twilight_sprinkle: With that in mind, would not the big freeze counter the Big Rip or the expanding?
also: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/382/128789_512x288_generated.jpg
Vordox: again, i dont quite understand what you mean by power through 0 kelbin. the big freeze and big rip are different theories though, afaik
twilight_sprinkle: Just cause they are different theories, does not exlude them in a single scenario
exclude*
Dark Energy are causing the expansion, if it's an energy, it may not go through 0 Kelvin freeze.
Vordox: pure energy may not be possible to measure through temperature at all, since temperature is movement of matter
twilight_sprinkle: Hmm, true.
Oh god
So much science
Oh wow, somepony else got K-lined
Been grubbling on this forever since our last talk. >
Polydunami: K-lined?
My brain is ready to exploded
Banned from the network
oh
Anyone else think K-lined sounds cooler than it is?
yeah, 0 Kelvin would be no matter movement, and there is no way it could get negative
oh thats right thelonepony ,i was going to try and k-line you :>
se never got around to that again..
*we
too bad I missedm out most of the science talk just now :/
so...this happened http://youtu.be/gP-TmS8BKng
thelonepony: so lets try it :P
Nope :3
;_;
fine, ill just permaban you, hows that sound?
Is that in Swedish?
no :3
;~;
Are U Ready?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cQJw6qYlH0&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLJEyD7cQcRYGVdMbSY7v5lA
Does anypony know who rdash was?
no idea
no
Polydunami, yeah he had an own channel
Just a random thought
Polydunami: Yes, why?
Polydunami, and own bots
I don't get why MLP isn't shown in England that I know of
Polydunami: he posted logs aparently, it is against the ToS
It's in every major country, 'cept Britain
I was wondering why he got K-Lined, is all
rdash makes bots
MLP_Brovakiin: what type of logs
?
thelonepony: chat logs
Serenity: It was on Boomerang during season 1, Idk if it still is though.
oh
All I know afterwards, was that MadSurge displayed a recording saying "P-P-P-P-PERMABANED!"
Meanwhile: I would be able to see why it wouldn't be on anymore. Boomerang used to be like a 5 year old channel
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdt6ubyJ1n1qdt23mo1_1280.png
Mm. Never really understood what Boomerang was trying to do.
Kandarihu, wow
So who will pick up the Twinkie patent?
Polydunami a mexican company
3.5 thousand quid!
Is that right?
Who would pay that for twinkies and a wii u?
because it's the last box of twinkines in the world....
Deacon: This isn't family guy >:U
And it will last forever... so long as Tallahassee doesn't find it.
Or me :P
oh ha, you kick me twilight_sprinkle
you did it
thelonepony: couldnt ban tho ;~;
thats okay
On top of installing something shady from HP, I also installed Firefox 17 in the process!
You're still learning

If it was ruled... People would have elected Sombra...
Before Celestia
:)
08,01Shizuka: he's got a lot of dangling pointers and no garbage collection
>_> I didn't ask for ponies. <_<

13that's what i said
Tobuscus probably the first MLP releated thing I saw was his screamed version the MLP Intro on Newgrounds
alexxm, just fine, thank you. You?
13== is a comparator asking if the expressions on either side are equal
why say that?

You know we have a FAVOURITE TUNE here that's Dutch

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YjEa9YcJ1w Vordox, i grew up with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvrdlmZXkes <--- For our resident Luna
Snow|Sick: Oh god
Snow|Sick: You have NO idea how big of a nostagia hit that was

Hey, everypony!
And of course Slurrymoon...
What's going on?
Vordox: They have went to a long Voyage across the world
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/db0d68f81a73c5fe67f28739e3b0cf31.jpg pretty pony :3
thelonepony: ;_;
Vordox: but they will be back
I believe in them :3
Vordox: Well NewDCD is in chat. BaconMane's busy, Vi's hard drive broke, Slurry is...I dunno, space or something.
Vordox: Vivi's still having dard drive issues, and Luna's going through some emotional problems, IIRC>
Vordox: of what does it reminds you it then?
Seems like I'm at least fairly well-known on here.
:D
MadSurge: She is pretty. :)
you then*
Vordox: Oh, and Luna's unwell.
Snow|Sick: Where to begin...
Sorry, I was busy looking up videos :S
Slurry's busy at college, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5O2ArpM2jc
Like this...
I'm listening to anime music right now. :3
Too many things ,Snow
Me = Huge anime freak
:P
AJIsAwesome: Believe so
Nope. Not interested.
Gurren lagann
?
its pretty funny
kan you guys help me out a lot?
YES!! TTGL IS AWESOME!!
JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM??
weccojecco: What d you need help with?
*do
:P
OK so what are we watching guys!
:(
I hate this laptop so much :|
Let's watch porn.
If you say TTGL is an amazing anime..
............
.I lose interest in talking to you :P
Snow|Sick: I do wish Death had a better VA. I don't really like his.
XD
kan you vote for itske on this site http://giel.vara.nl/fileadmin/static/Win-kaarten-voor-One-Direction.1114.0.html
There's 2 animes types
Vordox: didn't like it? :D
Juiced ones, and deep ones.
What anime types are those?
Juiced?
Vordox well about as interesting as dbz or naruto, or any other shonen anime, meh...
MadSurge: I liked the first part, but once they started to throw galaxies I just tableflipped and forgot it
You mean like, hyperkinetic and over-the-top?
Deacon: Meh, the big 3 are...
bleh
I'm wondering what 'juiced' means, myself.
Vordox: like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukSEaJpPyGw
I used to love One Piece, but it bores me now.
Bleach turned to crap after the Soul Society arc.
Snow|Sick: Like...wtf XD
And the less we say about Naruto, the better.
Well, at least One Piece actually has an ending planned out for it.
Yeah.
Vordox: Soul eater is best anime for me atm. action, fighting, humor and its not too long
also the same could be said about death note season 2
It's a long way off, though
Snow|Sick: It's decent
Bleach and Naruto are just throwing everything at the wall in a vain hope that something will stick.
Snow|Sick: did it finish?
It has it's own style, which I applauds for
thelonepony: it did
oh okay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrR42Fvg7I
On One Piece?
pony_6329: Stream is on <_<
I dropped One Piece shortly after the timeskip.
last episode of naruto I saw was when rock lee was drunk, and that's all I can remember
There's one flavour I love in Anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN_rI8VM3bw
and SZS
i watched Bleach for some eps
I don't doubt Oda-sensei's storytelling abilities, but he's overdoing everything in it to the point that nothing stands out.
It's its own Anime, heck even meta anime
lost interest at 84 i thought
I prefer shorter anime now, anyway.
XD
One Piece.... does not.
SZS is bloody crazy and I love it :D
So what server are prople here on for PS2?
My top 5 favorite anime are all under 50 episodes long.
XD
TTGL and NGE are my fav animes
i only watch none piece
Bobobobo Bobobo is best fighting anime :D
its as funny as hell
#1 favorite anime is cLANNAD.

I've never seen AYA.
Yw.
some people are telling me to watch elfen lied and evangilon or something like that
hello everypony

Snow|Sick: Elfen Lied is better as a Manga
Hey Tobuscus! :)
hi!
anyone here have persona 4 arena on the Ps3?
Anime is good, but still pretty thick
Snow|Sick: It depends on your anime taste, IMO.
I actually own the Ai Yori Aoshi visual novel.
SB \:3/
Dibs?
i needed to do important work
Ai Yori Aoshi is full of so many feels.
I tried watching Claymore, kinda dropped it when they mentioned only the women had superpowers
oh, and if you guys wanna know, CG is my fav anime
Manga is better, if by little.
Snow|Sick: CG?
CG?
code geass
Oh.

Snow|Sick: You are awesome. :D
NO
Season two is an absolute mess.

I like to sing
I keep on trying to get into Berserk
By the way, did I miss anything while I was gone?
Lots and lots of talk about anime and manga.
other than the anime/manga talk, nm
Didn't Scoots do a live reading of something, IIRC?
I'm about halfway through Stardust Crusaders, and I've been reading up on Steel Ball Run.
AJIsAwesome not as of late
Lame anime
But still good. :
If you've seen it, congrats, you seen a underground hit :P

Deacon: Hmm, I thought he told us he'd do a live reading of something in the morning.
My favorite JoJo so far is Jolyne Kujo.
Tobuscus: Go to the store and buy some?
She's the only female JoJo
And she's pretty good-looking too.

And NewDCD looked at the internet and was sad, for the bronies fled in strife. So he extended his mighty hand, and made bronystate. A place where tired brony veterans from the 4chan war could find peace, and those hunted by haters could find refuge. Then, when all was done, NewDCD looked over all he had created, and it was good.

AJfan77: if you follow the rules then rest easy :)
shh moment of silence
moment over
Jackson: Some here names are first come first serve, and some of us have names from the Pony fandom and stuff, so they took them and made them themselves. It's weird, but that's the truth of it. It's ...bleh. Internet
^
Well my name before Chrysalis was UnFoundBug
Well in the span of 2 days ive been warned twice so i know i wont do those 2 things again
they revealed the name and I HAD to change
Chrysalis: Oh, so that's who ytou were.
ded
well Jackson is my real name
i knew there would be a chrysalis here after season 2 was over so i didnt take that name
i was found :P
*you
you wanted Queen Chrysalis but someone beat you to it
Jackson, Like we care.
so i stuck to aniderp
TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah that REALLY pissed me off
Jackson: Internet smart!

Not as good as the bridge kill yesterday
Don't mock the great and powerful shizumobile, she does what ever the hell she wants, because she is ZEUS!
FREAK. ING. ZEUS.
Not sure why I name myself this name tbh
My name is unoriginal but im ok with that so buck of haters :P
Jackson: For instance, you can use ANY names fromt he MLP as long as it'snot taken, and you should NOT use names from youtube or fandoms. Basically.
bitch please, zeus WISHES he was as awesome as shizumobile
just think of a nickname that isnt taken, not that hard
DoctoDoctorWho: yes this was the first nick I had
VenHur: Pfft, Zeus has a motivational poster of Shizu-kiin. He WISHES he could be as great as her.
aniderp is taken by me
...So...Shizumobile is NOT Zeus...but Jesus?
DoctoDoctorWho: though I change it sometimes
:P
aniderp: no way :O
yea wai
Zeus is a dick, I'd be ashamed to be compared to such an asshole god.
I'd rather turn to chaos!

Shizuka: WAIT that's YOUR dragon!?

Nothing the Gourmet can't handle! (If you were watching last night, the joke would make sense)
Vordox: Did you never get the Odahviing shout?
hi
no
Meanwhile: I don't even have the GAME
Hi Jackson
hi
Vordox: That'll be why you're confused then. At one point you can score a dragons allegiance and he'll come when you call.
why would dragon have gold?
to buy things
dragons are people too
To buy cave wallpaper?
...
Meanwhile: duh.
I hate you guys. <_<
<3
Vordox Cause the dragon stereotype is they hoard things like gold and what else that is shiny?
i hate you too>_>
Even me vordox?
we hate u 2 Vordox we hate u 2 <3
I Hate you too Vordox <_<
i love skyrim
Vordox : We love you too :P
Awww
I feel the hate. >_>
Jackson: when we use >_> or <_< Face, we're being sarcastic
ok
^^
Since sarcasm is hard with text alone
but u just used it in that sentence. so were u being serious then too?
naturesfury: You forgot the AJ face. XD
For example Jackson : <_< I didn't ask for ponies. >_>
Do not ask for ponies! :[ EVER
Except when you do.
Meanwhile: Even if you don't, rather.
I had enough Live shows for my life
And G3.6 too...

09,01Duwang is delayed
09,01so tonight we watching 4-7 and Duwang 4-5
The amount of lemons your connection sucks can not be measured in mortal numbers.

twilight_sprinkle : No wonder there is so much reading. I'm kidding! :)
09,01there's still no Duwang for the lastest two episodes
Alchemist: Upward fangs?

Meanwhile: it's less sucking of lemons and more having sex with them

Needs more giant mudcrab.
Vordox: Be right back ok?
Jackson: You don't need to say it each time
ok
Troll arrow.
Vordox: you'd have to go Heavy Armor and a Khajiit to do that effectively
Jackson: Mostly, saying Hi and bye. :)
otakon: Khahahit?
ok
Vordox: I was going to make a char like this, sword and sheild, because i realized i dont have a char like that yet, oddly enough.
maybe you need to yell at the arrow
staring at that patch of ground is your objective
Vordox: no Khajiit
otakon: Which is?
cool
twilight_sprinkle: Thawing snow
that's one sensetive ass button
To become true dragonborn, you must watch this patch of floor for a day.
br guys
how'd the snow not set it ooff
Jackson: You don't have to say it each time. :P
Hey whos streaming?

Bronysith: Wron

Bo > All
Vordox: bo staff?
Bronysith: Indeed
oh yes, the bo staff
yay
so is elder scrolls online going to be good
Feck you Sword, I have RANGE
!
Vordox: why is it in any book or movie, anime, game, story, comics, it is always the damn sword...
eqd!
who do i praticipate in the lottery?
Bronysith: Because Hollywood
Sacrifice a small child to the lord of lotto.
oaky
thats what i thought
Bronysith: Also, check out Fate Stay Night :P
Alchemist: It's working fine for me, only annoyance was a 63 person queue to get in. But then I do have 40-50Mbps internet, so that it complicate the issue if you have slow internet. Or maybe your firewall?
You need to pay 70,000 Horse Bucks to the site treasurer.
Vordox: later, in the middle of playing persona 3, and persona 4 arena,
ooooh
Oh hey DrDissonance in EQD
we gots da musics
SafariMonkey: no, my isp is really bad. I stopped playing BF2 because of the constant connection drops.
is there a stream?
yep.
SafariMonkey: it might be the same issue here.
Alchemist: Oh, then it's probably that. :/
He's going to finger your buyer.
finger the buyer
....
alexxm: what?
Bronysith they were talking about fingering a buyer on there
You do know fingering someone has other meanings, right? :D
alexxm: hahahah, thats disgusting
lol
Alchemist yep
What is their thing with fingers?
Alchemist: Is there an official bronystate comms channel? Skype?
They're fingering buyers and fingering pies
CriticKitten: it's better than just watching a stiff wooden head talk
Animaniacs "allright, lets look for fingerprints" "I FOUDN HIM" she is holding the artist prince. "no, fingerprints." looks at prince, "yea thats not happening"
They need to start wearing gloves.
Or keep their hands to themselves.
Bronysith: the RANCHIEST joke in the series, how it got past censors is beyond me
otakon out of fucking nowhere
Vordox im back
SafariMonkey: I dont know. I think yesterday they were on the Woodman server though with a recognizable squad name. Ask Wrek or sumica, I think they were on then.
Bronysith: It should be "second sister, dust for prints!"
Jackson: I'mnot the only one here. :P
soooo
you scared me
the joke
otakon: it is definetely one of the best animated series out there targeted towards kids and pre teens, except for that other one >.> "batman the animated series"
No one is like "why are books lying in the street"?
:P
I love how casual the townsfolk are.
CriticKitten: foolish fool, dont you know it rains paper on a daily basis
CriticKitten twilight would have a fit
CriticKitten: well some people pick up stuff for you
they dont care
if those are college grade books, please pick em up and sell them, those things cost a fortune
yes
CriticKitten plus it's probably business as usual given that the thieves guild seems to be a semi official gulid in this city
CriticKitten: they also dont mind if an almost naked man is running around town, jumping up&down in front of guards.
/me licks alexxm
/me licks Bronysith :P
/me puts Bronysith in the naughty corner
Vordox i got my new phone and im using siri
Siri?

Meanwhile: considering dealing with dragons is a daily ordeal, not surprised

Goddamn BEST animated show EVER

twilight_sprinkle: have you ever "censored"? the after feeling is amazing
Justin: weed wont help escape the depression though
Wait is this the same chat?

Meanwhile: or Vera
If I had a gun I would name it Tallahassee
my left foot's named Slippyfists's Revenge

09,01like how in anime characters explain their techniques?
09,01in JoJo, they explain it with STYLE
oh hey Jojo!

DAMN YOU LOUSY COUNTRY INTERNET!
09,01it's just that section on the opening
otakon he explained that bit earlier.
Pay attention.
09,01it's due to the encoding
NewDCD: the sun emits many waves, including visible light

And canada_brony is an annoying prick. :P
He's new
My finger slipped and I destroyed your lungs. My bad.
twilight_sprinkle: no but it's gotta be ultraviolet light since the average light source is impossible to reproduce back then
Poor Speedwagon
THE HELL
wait
Why is it called ultraviolet light in the first place? You bloody well can't see it :S
it's 1847 isn't it?

There's old annoying pricks too
http://i.imgur.com/u9Ujm.jpg http://i.imgur.com/t8EXy.jpg
NewDCD: baseball cap on Jojo, WHY?
otakon why does it have to ultraviolet in particular?
Polydunami: Because it's a wavelength of light that lies just beyond visible violet.
twilight_sprinkle: bc that's what blows up Vamps
hmm
Dio Tiara vs AppleJo
09,01also it's not a baseball cap
Lawl
what is it then?
09,01it's a sleuth hat thingy
CrystalPhoenix: YES :D i love it!
oh, its that one guy who shows up on occasion.\7

09,01look at the part on the back
NewDCD or something like that

Mary Stuart had blue hair, fact!
dari is not an english man D: i been living a lie
History isn't really my strong point. :P

MadSurge: I do too! its so interesting seeing Japanese getting into pony!

All Englishmen know of Tarkus.

Rex_Mundi: tbh it's interesting to see anyone get into pony :3c
just pisses the heroes off
apparently my download of KotOR was what....nvm
BELIEVE IIIIIIT
I will eat you!
Great leading line.
09,01GOT YOUR NOSE!
MadSurge: Yeah, but most Japanese have no idea what MLP even is. Its neat reading their comments. "00:00:03 It’s a real lifesaver that there’s so many translators now… also, my ipod has gradually turned into something I cannot let anybody see"
damn
DAMN
Rex_Mundi: :D
WHy haven't they made a proper Jojo game?
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5890171_460s.jpg
I know about the fighting game
JOJO !

but like a Dynasty Warriors type game I think would fit well
Does that one medieval englishman... have a cowboy hat?
09,01they're making All Star Battle and it seems like it will be released in US
Rex_Mundi: it's a bowler
ah
NewDCD: nice
wtf is right
nope his hair
in boss fights, all water turns to a bloody hue
yeah Dio is a wanker
Would anyone be interested in reading a fanfic I'm writing?
youd think dio would underestimate jojo Again
o.o
There is no need for me, DIO! to say my own name while talking, but I shall do so anyway!
*wouldnt
twilight_sprinkle: he's very VERY haughty
whats it about, pikorar?
Quick. Call apon the sea ponies!
YOUR ONE WEAKNESS IS YOUR NEED TO BREATHE

Just came in here 3 minutes ago, i have no idea what just happend
Polydunami: yes it is
pretty good
Hey there, aniderp
Overdriven.
actually waves dont propagate faster in water. if its just lightning, it should hit him too
Okay, just checking
Everyone getting ready for the annual pig-out?
eeyup
Sometimes you say really stupid stuff when you're tired though haha
I baked bread for my house
08,01i think C is my favourite language
but for some reason it's on the hard side
Just came to say hi and whatnot, see how you guys are doing.
I made little onion and noodle kugels.
AssaultWithEmbraces: getting ready for turkey day
huuuh....hey
09,01he meant it in the sense he cannot send ripple projectiles in air
10 summers... but then winter is coming
I haven't been on in a while :S
09,01he needs a conduit
Rex_Mundi: 10 years
man this catchy :D
08,01the only thing i don't really like about it is that it doesn't support overloading
I never talk in my sleep
It's been maybe three or four days since last I logged in.
otakon, ikr. We're about to make some stuffing after dinner
08,01not properly, anyway
And artichoke dip.
one of my friends says really crazy stuff though
08,01as far as i'm concerned, that'd make it awesome and perfect
NewDCD: but i thought they were waves or something? eh nvm, doubt theres a point in overthinking it
I never do either
08,01otakon: i've been sitting coding for the last 8 hours solid. i need to vent somewhere
by brother does
http://i.imgur.com/IeSZY.jpg
08,01and there *are* people in here who would be interested
Well, that's a Global.
on't tell me i missed Jojo's bizare Adventures
wow, netsplit for me then :D
okay THAT was a laggy kick
hahaha
08,01probably
jo jo
yeah like ... damn
ooh, what kind otakon?
where was I sent again?
the fuck
nice and simple
08,01>C
Anyway, gotta go to bed guys. Goodnight!
08,01>simple
overloading would be good but it'd have to be explicit, maybe as a typedef
bye MadSurge sleep well
Good night, MadSurge :3
:)
Bye MadSurge !
Oh AssaultWithEmbraces :3
Bye everyone!
Bye mad-damn it
:I
Well time to cooki! be back on whenever
08,01Phase4: forward declaration, pointer indirection, weird, weird stuff with structs
08,01it's a crazy language
08,01but also small and lovely
09,01have you heard of Tarkus and Bruford
So do stands come into this at all DCD?
09,01not until Part 3

All Englishmen know oF tarkus

he knew Bruford wouldn't do it
Ohshit
Pfft.
This anime
all of my what
yeah it's out there
dafuq?
;o;
I just can't take this. It's like Hokuto no Ken, only about 50 times more ridiculous.
Dat running commentary.
DocSane: awesome right?
BAM
Jojo wins
Friendship
Ruck?
09,01for those that don't know
LUCK !
Pruck.
XD
and then he died like a sir
09,01Pluck is an old-timey word for "Courage"
Pluck
Really? Pluck?
This is...stupid XD
Pluck isn't old-timey
>:
AWESOME but...
well, at least he didnt write "cluck"
damn
09,01so basically it's Luck and Pluck
09,01he needs Luck and Bravery
LAWl
hes now the plucky hero
THE AWAW YEAH FACE
BUQNO face xD
XD
1785
09,01because most people would have died in History rather than getting a failing grade
yeah Tarkus is still a zombie
Goddamn
Nice catch!
now that is power
nice cach\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ROAR
ABAJ, OVVERDRAIVU
PLANTS DO NOT WORK LIKE THAT
A HEART
NewDCD: lol no i meant make a history video as crazy as Jojo :D
so overdrive is like go go gadget ?
LOLWAT
:DDDD
Plants work however the fuck they want
or a giant rock slime
^
PLOT EXPLINATION
Plants are anarchic in nature.
09,01THE ASS WAS FAT
LIFE IS NOT MAGNETIC
Troll kid.
making them into a magnet wouldnt help anyway, but goddamn :D
Vordox: electromagnetism
Magnets, how do they work?
No one tell Jojo he's a robot
twilight_sprinkle: all the leaves are sticking together acting as a parachute
otakon: magnets...wtf
Dat face.
handshake of epicness
Vordox, Fucking Magnets how do they work?
CrystalPhoenix: Dat homestuck
also Steam's Autumn sale is going on now
Home...stuck?
dude no
homestuck is awfu;
Vordox: wat
awful even
eeww homestuck
I guess most here do not know it...
Nevermind, it's internet history =P
hai guyz
CHWABABAAAAAA
That's what he said right?
That meme isn't anything to do with Homestuck
exactly
its clown possee i think
or however its spelled
Vordox, it's from insane clown posse
aaaaaand im back
Excuse me, everyone. Gonna play some games.
inother words class give it all a big hug
YOU learn your internet history
totototot laugh historically!
He doesn't look very immobilised.
CrystalPhoenix: I know
CrystalPhoenix: That's why I said Homestuck
The building leaking evil green mist?
Sure, seems like a nice enough place to chill out.
take shelter in a building with toxic fumes
dddgh
Turns out this was a stupid idea. Who'd have guessed.
What a weird anime
Two headed Dragon? we playing MtG now
Vordox, it didn't started in homestuck
CrystalPhoenix: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004718
i summon YOU!
it might be in homestuck but definitely did not started there
Everything ends and begins with the Simpsons
turn the chain into a sword using item.spawn ripple and you'll be fine!
CrystalPhoenix: Homestuck got linked to them
Suddenly got larger, meme got more famous.
etc etc etc insert Human stupidy for finding stupid things
wow.
XDDDDD
ahhh
LOL
wat
he pissed himself.
:D
Why was the kid pissing himself relevant to anything.
:D
how is everyone?
so you think homestuck is responsible for something that started in a completely different manner?
wow
how delisiounal
:3 Jigsaw Approves of this game!
Guys pissing your pants is cool now didn't you know
dude homestuck freakin sucks
I am alive
Vordox, I'm sorry to say but Homestuck was just ju,ping on the bandwagon
hey people :>
Zamer: :3 Billy Madison
it wasn't the trigger that made the video famous
Zamer YES :D
Kid you pissed yourself, you literally lost control of your bladder. What on earth are you gonna do about anything?
highfive to those that caught the reference
he'll use the pissing ripple technique of course!
people back then were assholes
/me pokes someone
>back then
ouch
>implying people aren't assholes now
true
You aint cool,unless you pee your pants! Billy Madison :D
Yeah people're definitely assholes.
Period of history's irrelevant.
hi thelonepony
so who's flashback is this?
Tomorrow never arrives kid
Hi aniderp :)
pfff
if assholes never existed we wouldn't have all this great technology today
Get it together Poko.
true
you ah teahing me apaht lisa
Manup.jpg
^
that was princess-dabi
so remember whn you meet a asshole thank him for his sacrifice
CrystalPhoenix: I find it funny
CrystalPhoenix: Your saying homestuck NOT aiding the cause of the meme "did little"
You have any idea how many fans there are of Homestuck?
and they're all terrible
wonder how many of those fans are over the age of 18
and you have any idea how many lurks 4chan?
announce yourself entering the room, vrilliant
Jeezus.
How is that kid not fucking dead.
ta-da
fuckin anime that's how
CrystalPhoenix: An insane Asylum gives destiny to the internet
09,01the power of HOT BLOOD
XD
maybe it did help but certainly it did not made that a meme
You're crazy CrystalPhoenix
and hot piss
it was a meme BEFORE homestuck jumped in the bandwagon
That dude can hit with enough force to break brick with his fists, that kid would've frickin shattered and turned into a bag full of broken bone.
09,01because JoJo pulled the chain
Vordox, you're the one convinced a shitty comic made something popular when it was popular before is referenced it
you're the crazy one son
09,01he deflected most of the blow
Vordox, ALOT of Meme got famous thanks to 4chan
Thank you Buytoast
CrystalPhoenix: Are you refuting that 4chan is not an insane asylum of Anons
?
That was EPIC!
no 4chan is the sewage of the internet
^
Vordox, I lurk 4chan
^^^
09,01so basically Poko was just grazed by the punch and it STILL fucked him up
tell me I'm insane
yeah CrystalPhoenix you are insane
CrystalPhoenix: Yes you are
so is RX by the way
Crim you are insane
he lurks there too
jojo doesnt really make any sense, no point in thinking about it, just enjoy the insanity
CrystalPhoenix: you are insane :3
so is Bronysith
eeyup
twilight_sprinkle: makes perfect sense for the show
twilight_sprinkle: suspension of disbelief
twlight_sprinkle if you want a anime that doesn't make any sense watch Excel Saga
oh crap
Zeppelli is gonna bite it
GODDAMMIT! Go in peace Dapper Hermit
otakon: yes, turning ground into a flying magnet parachute that holds together with a magical ripple force makes perfect sense
If you want an anime that makes sense then...well good luck.
Anime in general is a gatway to insanity
that or the less funny Magical Shopping Arcade
Dayum
CrystalPhoenix: Proof enoughP? 0P
wait what
WAT
Zamer: i saw that anime, it actually makes some sense, because its like a parody
proof enough of what?
Zamer: excel i mean
wait three years just to START learning The Ripple?
CrystalPhoenix: You being insane cause you lurk 4chan for... whatever it is
Homestuck is still a bandwagon jumping piece of shit
:) I'm gonna be hungover tomorrow if I keep shooting this whiskey - Cheers! Everpony
oh boy
CrystalPhoenix: And MLP isnät
?
Star Wars, Star Trek
wtf is homestuck?
All band wagons with no impact of social society
Bye Cypresswolf|AFK :)
Dare say I am wrong
Bye Cypresswolf|AFK :)
:D I forgot to change my status
Sheeeyeeeeeeeeetttt
dayum, do they eat trucks for breakfast, without any milk
I like your style
but still we're talking about homestuck starting a meme here
Zamer ah man i remember Magical Shopping Arcade :D
CrystalPhoenix: I never said it started it
when what it did was jumping in the meme
But it did became more famous by it
WHAT
There we go
probably just a good idea to let it drop
yeah remember he's still injured
You're changing your stuff
no wonder you win all the time
that was a pretty precise vision, with the gate and everything
1000 people doing one thing, and 100k doing it, I see the difference easily, CrystalPhoenix
twilight_sprinkle: it's a predicition
oatkun pls, stop trying to apply logic to this show
FUCK YOU DIO
Shame I couldnt find this series at Oni con
I'm done here I've said what I needed
he won't change his mind CrystalPhoenix
09,01>oatkun
09,01>Oat-Kun
they usually can't when faced with the truth
what?
09,01WILL NEVER UNSEE
CrystalPhoenix: Leaving the discussion, fine.
09,01YOUNG MISTER OATS
NewDCD: that? that's old man... where have you been?
Vordox, yes cause I know it'll go in rounds
Except oatkun is 29.
09,01places
NewDCD: Shizuka started calling me otakun a while back actually
CrystalPhoenix: Weird, I haven't changed anything from the start
and I'm 28 thank you
Meanwhile and a potato
otakon is best facial hair
09,01<twilight_sprinkle> oatkun pls, stop trying to apply logic to this show
Rose`: wait how do you know of my beard?

Duwang is amazing
09,01I'd ripple yo ass if you were to hurt such a genius

Hey DCD, have we seen all the current eps now?
CriticKitten: BAH! pepper and salt on mayonnaise with turkey is DELICIOUS

twilight_sprinkle: it plainly says "warning horror episode" at the top

Dovah: so? it also says comic, comics dont usually involve sound
hm
twilight_sprinkle: Please forgive me for interacting with chat, I am deeply sorry.
Dovah: oh please, youre not interacting, youre just linking shock images for your own amusement
If only a mod were here
why is there never a mod around when someone links a shocker
cause
:I
twilight_sprinkle, mod conspiracy
what shocker?
Hi Guys :)
Somebody posted a shocker?
DinkyDoo: eeyup
GabeMoist: it was the mods all along :O
I could've been on here sooner but I have some encoding going on
Hi sonicdude558 :)
DinkyDoo: yeah, dovah over there did
As it turns out, the mods are the ones linking the shockers in disguise
http://i.imgur.com/iUrBh.jpg i actually met this guy at dragoncon XD
DinkyDoo: I did, as I didnt realize it fell under "explicit material"
there are no shockers here..
Ello people of the interwebs
Dovah: "Posting of Rule 34, pornography, gore, shock images or any content or messages deemed overly sexual or obscene in nature is strictly prohibited. "
Hi Hoodee

Hi CCCP

thelonepony: Just tell me.
HoodyNinja: it was a screamer,not something you want to be around for
Was it like Cupcakes or something?
Or was it worse than cupcakes?
twilight_sprinkle: As I said, I didn't realize it fell under explicit material. Now, can we please just drop it?
/me gives CCCP, thelonepony, and twilight_sprinkle a bucket
>Implying Cupcakes is even remotely shock worthy.
A screamer :D
Ahaha
That all?

DinkyDoo: a comic, i actually didnt open it cause i read what others said, altho i think ive seen it before. you scroll down, theres images of a zombie turning, then when you get to the bottom of the comic theres a loud yell i think
[SWAG]Haku: nothing much, just cooling down from playing persona 4 arena, man, fighting games take alot out of you
DashWithRainbows: I have read the rules but i havnt been around for a long time, its my fault I know, but really, everyone makes mistakes.
Hello ~
Bronysith cool cool
HI EmrysofBakerStreet
Bronysith: Only if you yell or play on kinect
ello EmrysofBakerStreet
Interesting name
hoi EmrysofBakerStreet
I'm sure you've been around here plenty of times when some people posted shock images, Dovah.
HoodyNinja: have you ever played fighting games?
/me punches someone
Bronysith: Who hasn't?
twilight_sprinkle: it had a freaky girl at the end
or you know, just any personal decency wouldve been sufficient to not link a shocker
Oi, [SWAG]Haku Leave someone alone!
/me falcon kicks someone else
HoodyNinja: obviously you, the exact concentration it takes for fighting games is alot
DashWithRainbows: Actually, no, I havnt
Huh.
Still, twilight_sprinkle made a good point.
Bronysith: That, or you're unfocused most of the time
nyeh
thelonepony: was she standing in the shadows, and in the frames slowly turning around?
[SWAG]Haku: what are you doing?
/me is punched by [SWAG]Haku
He's eating pizza
Like me
twilight_sprinkle: eeyup *shivers*
writing essays for scholarships, mostly
thelonepony: yeah i think ive seen it before
[SWAG]Haku: mostly come out at night?
3 More passes and I am finally done with this stupid encode.
twilight_sprinkle: she had a bloody face that i might add
Bronysith Mostly
Isnt disscussing it also not allowed, now that i've reread the rules.
[SWAG]Haku: dont forget to write how you want to help the university and be active
...
Um
no thanks
But that would be a lie
/me /
And Haku doesn't lie
Thats not what the essays ask for
Rigth Haku?
[SWAG]Haku: thats what they look for in scholarships though
no its not
le shrug, thats what everyone told me
For example
>le
"Answer the essay question: Why is free speech important at our nation's colleges and universities? Using examples from both videos, discuss how censorship of student speech is incompatible with higher education. Your essay should be 800-1,000 words. "
le, for casualness
And then you write the paper
'( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[SWAG]Haku: i shall help out with the college
[SWAG]Haku: oh well thats a bit different
not really
bornismith pls, ur still in high school
twilight_sprinkle: um...no
Feels http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mK8vkOngF8&feature=BFa&list=PLE8C4D4F2A84C3843&shuffle=851392
Only some scholarships are for specific schools, most just look for the best answers

/me is a reference to Kratos
I had been playing God of War at the time I found Bronystate
I see..
I hate GOd of War
:o
you do? why?
God of War IV: Kill everything that moves
Stallion_of_War: what is being refrenced? I dont remember a SoW in GoW
Ponified Kratos
The story is almost non-existant, the combat feels easy, the gor eis unnecesary, and it's main selling point besides gore is sex.
Stallion_of_War: That isnt already dead
I don't get it..
what's left for kratos to even kill?
Stallion_of_War oh . . . OH I get it!
In Pokemon, you can battle dragons, become the champion, surf, and fly on Pokemon that are tinier than you..
I'm pretty sure Kratos kills lots of things that are technically dead. Zombie soldiers
But for some reason, you can't get passed TREES.
Boobs; Boobs everywhere
well, there's not that many sex in the first game, other than those floozies before athens and the naryieds
where be thy boobs
but that's about it
Almost every female character in God of War
because i came in at a weird conversation about games and boobs
lol
I was discussing the abundance of naked chests in God of War
There is 1 sex game in each, is that enough to bitch about?

So, are we allowed to talk about the covers of MLP tie-in magazines, or is that breaking the spoilers rule?
does it involve future events?
no
Mornin' DaringDerpy

oh wait, those comics... I dunno, since they're kinda non-cannon
00:03:33 So in other words, Fluttershy wants AJ to read her a story?
I dont think its going to be cannon. Also, seaponies
Mermare Republic rules all!
Ahem, Its canon
Anyways
all yalls thoughts on Daniel tosh covering bronies

Can't wait until I get a wii U! But i'll need to wait a month or two before I can buy a second gamepad. But I'll be buying a Wii Remote + And Nunchuck to play wii games.
apparently japan is in love with AJ and already is shipping her with Rarity in this episode

there were more than 57 when he came up with that slogan, but he liked the number
/me One does not simply brace themselves, for winter is coming.
no i don't know what they were ;)
Canadian_Brony: Unless the Deluxe is sold out and they're impatinet for it get to get restocked
J_E_Smith71 that's why you phone Futureshop and order it for in-store pick-up.
Do you even have Futureshop down there?
sigh wish there was an easy way to get crystals in MLP :S not gonna spend money to get 100 or so and not be able to get Dash Shy and Rarity :D
One does not simply patroll the mojave, it almost makes you wish nuclear winter was coming, untill you I took an arrow to the knee because then the fire nation attacked.
SuperBrony64 \:3/
Canadian_Brony: No we have Gamestop but it's probably the same thing
Rex_Mundi: die
all my ponies in my mlp game cost coins now :$
Dammit Braeburn in reference to him being partially useless in the episode
00:21:38 Braeburn is a tree so of course it can’t be helped

Zamer: Dont think she was
Any time of day, even times they say they'll be on! Just gone!

You know what the most under rated game ever is? Ecco 2, the Tides of time. Seriously, its an awesome game and most people havnt heared of it, and a lot of the few who do dismiss it because you pl;ay as a Dolphin
Deacon: Eeyup :(
man, the bond writer mustve been absolutely delighted when he was writing about the french midget who got humiliated by bond
I had a shiny ditto once, I named it blueberry
wait when was Ecco 2 ever underrated
no stream? :3
Rex_Mundi it's also confusing
Deacon: In Pokemon black and white 2, when you catch every Pokemon from every region you get something that raises the chance of finding a shiny Pokemon!
gunthler there is a stream it's the buffer's stream time
Gunthler: Its the buffer show.
O U guise.
silly.
Best show ever :3
I bet. ;)
no stream? Solution, moar dakka.
Deacon: Yeah, but its a game for hardcore games really, its a gamer test kind of game.
I've seen it before, as well. It has a nice plot.
DinkyDoo eeyup, the shiny charm, though not gonna waste my effort getting it
CHANCE OF FINDING SHINY POKEMON: 1/8192
:[ Ahhhhhhhhhhhh no stream?!
no the best show is that rainbow show that is sometimes joined with a buzzing noise
I'm never going to be an awesome shiny hunter..

:>
11,02Eddmario: Okies :3
How was that Tosh.o clip even funny? Nothing but a lol R34 joke? Really?
Blopsii...
Rex_Mundi it's funny because it's not funny and Tosh.0 viewers are like 10yrolds
Wat...
the most impresive about that clip is that he managed to get r34 aired on tv
Rex_Mundi: shock factor is all it is
http://cheezburger.com/6773403136
aside from that i really don't care
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, that was on live tv? o.o
So, I'm gonna go see Trans-Siberian Orchestra in a couple of weeks...
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it was censored for broadcast but in the studio it was uncensored
AdamTheDuck: no it was post edited
in that case it sucks alltoghether
The comments were funnier
did the same with "2 Girls 1 Cup"
showed the audience watching it
"It would be better if he actually put up something arousing."
and again with some girl popping a huge cyst on a guy's back
and I mean HUGE
eww
and with that episode with the naked women beerpong in some provocative launch positions
Hai everypony
Hello Derpy_Hooves

The good thing is that everyone who watches Tosh knows hes just a dick to everything.
Oh, Happy Thanksgiving
Goign to sleep, Goodnight everyone
How did he show UNCENSORED clop on NATIONAL TV? Rex_Mundi
it's edited later for tv CrazyHippie
but it's shown unedited at the studio
still not sued? no concerned parents or something?
Parents???
Parents who let their kids watch Tosh?
Comedy Central being sued by parents
the kind of people who sues publishers for illegal information
you think responsible parents watch a show like that with their kids?
you mean concerned soccer moms
:P
that hasn't happen since South Park about 10 years agi
whatever
ago
Luck auduance...
when it was shown during the afternoon
well Comedy central let matt and trey get aways with that tourettes episdoe
no thats apple

Like atheists dont ever play the victim
Good night
good night Rex_Mundi
hallo and goodnight CCCP
Night CCCP
DaringDerpy: Im not CCCP
Goodnight CCCP

Its r34 of characters owned by Hasbro, how could they do that?
/me Dances

00,10and then I saw an ad that would ensure that SuperBrony64 would be eating alot of burgger king
Ponies47: Yes, I did
ALLONS-Y
only thing that could be done is the fanartists permission which wouldn't hold much ground since they are using copyrighted characters
everyone has seen it by now
hey everyone

Ponies47: this material exists, the people who make and use it exist.
00,10yup
Tell him theres probobly R34 of his favorite football team, or something
DaringDerpy, You have a point
that'll teach him
Ponies47: "not THAT dedicated to ponies" :)
also, explain r34 to him. he will find it proven
Ryunosuke, That would be a good one to use

Here it is
00,10IE now downloads othere browsers 50% faster

What did Firefox do?
okay, stupid question
whats the discount on black friday again?
like 50% or somewhere?
What the name for this?
SpadeMagnes[R], oh it's not Firefox can't do, it's just the annoyance of my trying to customising it to look like my Chrome. http://i.imgur.com/WIbqg.jpg
ok...now im getting tired of it...:|
LunaRoyalGuard: go to popout
take it off
Also I still think the morons going on strike because they have to work on early black friday are being a bunch of whiny brats
and dont refresh
simple
SpadeMagnes[R]: they dont know its good busness
Not to mention they can be easily replaced
Lots of people are looking for jobs
eeyup
And they dont have to work the whole damn day...
at this time, yeah
My mind is full of PINK!
Is it just me or does the pinkie thing slow down soemtimes?
and curses i need a job :I
AdamTheDuck that is sweet, but I do prefer to see Dashie when I start 'er up http://i.imgur.com/NAYn4.jpg
I swear its just me
I popped it out some time ago
:3 my chrome is entirely twilight sparkle skinned
What is the name of this?
And my windows color is purple
Well I refreshed. And there's no muting this, is there?

Kandarihu popout the stream and close it

Good night, Luna
Canadian_Brony, I'd like to avoid resorting to that if I can
Canadian_Brony: Thanks, but I would like to know the name of the flash program
Kandarihu yeah, I understand why. AlienWarhead no clue.
thanks anyway

Server?
Ocassionlly its giving me this crap that theres some error

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uurupmBurBM&feature=BFa&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B

NocturnalBlade: My family is stuck under a lamppost, help required, reward given: 1 dollar.
/me helps Adolf_Ghostler with his problem
SpadeMagnes[R: If everypony is banned... then why are the mods there?
A random derpy should show up randomly through out this
YES!
MY FAMILY
HoodyNinja: Exactly
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/772/

Im so showing that pic to the mods though
I'm keeping the one dollar though.
In-fact.
So... where did lyra's obsession with fingers come from?
thelonepony: like a ma'am
*Eats one dolloar*
Yeah..where did Lyra's hand thing originate from?
I will enjoy the paper cuts.
first it was how she was sitting
I think it's 100% fan.
SpadeMagnes[R, when people saw her "sit" like a human, they came up with the idea of her attempts to be more human
she sat like a human
I just want to know what the origin is.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5561/ British Derpy is best derpy
That's really it?
Any particuler reason the stream doesn't have an interface?
SpadeMagnes[R, d'awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Pretty long leap.

i would disagree myself
http://fav.me/d59wade
ive seen depressed people told to get the fuck out here
:D
what did I just walk in on?
I think the only reason we're actually chatting with each other is because the stream is just a spam of Pinkiesand "FUN".
Adolf_Ghostler, we chat when stream is up .-.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2458/ This is my response to any new bronies here

I hate it when in borderlands 2 you buy a helmate and it doesnt show
tom is best pony
derpy hooves is best pony!
i hate it in borderlands 2 when you buy it adn it doesn't end up being a good game
Flitter is best pony
i was sad at last boss fight it was too easy

So magestic.
legitimate question right there
AppleBloom: i have
no joke
I tried, but my European accent stops me from doing it.
:D http://i.imgur.com/oMEJg.jpg
^ agreed
You guys know what the centaurs in fallout look like?
Nope.
never played fallout so.... that'd be a no my good sir
Use google
I played through both Falouts.
Fallouts*
\
Anyway I thought what they would look like as ponies and I nearly threw up
only loves assassin's creed
Adolf there is 6 fallouts what do you mean both?
BlaxBlain: Ouch.
I don't know why people say Falout: New Vegas stunk, I loved the story to that better than Fallout 3.
BlaxBlain: WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!?
Not my fault you guys are the one who brought up fallot!
It's like jabba the huts ugly step cousin
fallout
Fallout 3 side quests were better though.
I myself too are sickend by those creatures
oh luna it has tentacles coming out of its mouth
:S
My friend on Skype keeps sending me R34 pony links...
AJIsAwesome: im just curious, In your opinion who is best pony?
I don't have a "Best Pony". :)
http://www.ponypic.com/i/OCvhE.gif
AJIsAwesome, >_>
but but your name is AJisawesome
Flitter is best pony.
AppleBloom: Because she's my favorite pony. :)
AdamTheDuck: INORITE?! he lie >.>
Flitter and Cloudchaser CAN HAVE A GOOD SITCOM THING BUT NO! JUST R34 INCEST!
God why did jeb add bats to minecraft they are so annoying.
Adolf_Soarinler: :S
was I the only one that didn't see flitter in the cartoon and thought she was an OC?
AppleBloom: I didn't see her as an OC.
Oc?
original character
If anyone was, it would probably be Thunderlane.
I just thought flitter and cloudchaser were some tumblr OC
They are
Oh wait
...
They're in the show
After Hurrican Fluttershy
GO AWAY BATS!
Then they made it
The tumblr I men
mean*
BlaxBlain: but bats are awesome! Just look at batman
Same thing with people like Sombra.
*ponies
King Sombra R34?
:S
ok so was it me or was sombra a little dark for a kids show?
Don't tell they did that?
Applebloom: The bats in minecraft in creative are annoying
The Tumblrs are made shortly after episodes.
Oh
Tumblrs
I'm pretty sure someone already made a Ask G3 Pinkie Pie Tumblr. :D
BlaxBlain: I only play 360's version of minecraft so I dont have to deal with them yet
Best Tumblr pony is Surprise.
AppleBloom: Bats are proof jeb hates us
surprise was an OC by Laura though, wasnt she?
No
G1 Pinkie Pie
Pinkie's original design.
Was Surprise.
I knew surprise was the original design
well i'm gonna be off to bed guys :) see yall later and Happy Thanksgiving ^_^
but I thought faust made her first then decided to go with pinkie pie
Night, NocturnalBlade. :)
night NocturnalBlade
G1 Twilight is actually G4 Twilight's mom.
Night, nocturnal
AppleBloom: She made the concept design, but she went with G3 Pinkie.
/me hugs AJIsAwesome AppleBloom and Adolf_Soarinler :)
/me hugs NocturnalBlade back :)
ahh, so in essence surprise was laura's OC then
*Too lazy to hug*
Technically, yes.
backes cake for NocturnalBlade, fairwell
bakes*
MeDropingMyEarPlugs.gif
Ok so...... is spike like... twilights personal slave?
Spike was also in G1 and G3.
Not to me.
Just a little thing to note in
Under the same name also.
I mean where are his parents in all of this, did the university steal spike when he was an egg? Wheres scootaloo's parents for that matter
AppleBloom: Let's let the show explain that. :)
So many questions.... so long to wait for new episodes
JRP ANGRY JRP SMASH
applebloom is confused by jrp's actions
Adolf Soarinler still recruiting more pegasis.
pegasai Vs. Unicorns, Discuss!
Pegasis are better
Discussion done
:D Well this is an apt thing to see upon entering Bronystate
Pegasi=Unicorns.
Hi, MadSurge. :)
Is this a new "stream off" feature? :D
I have no idea. :D
Pinkie enters competition and wins by default
Pinkie Pie is OP
agreed, we need a nerf
Pinkie Pie = Modern Warfare 3 Striker
Earth ponies are better :D
No, Pegasis are.
EARTH PONIES?! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
What the heck?
I kind of agree with madsurge, I mean they got nothing special. And yet they still manage to survive
Pegasis still superior.
I have lost my spelling
but that RD <3
Marshmellow Vs. Dictionaries! go!
wut

AppleBloom: and they got more strength too :)

HI, Cypresswolf! :)
MadSurge: not sure if want
How's it going AJ :)
hi Cypresswolf
Hello Cypresswolf
I"m fine, Cypress. How about you? :)

AdamTheDuck: do they spell crusaders with a 'k'?
AppleBloom, umm, not sure .-.
I thought it was "C"
I did too but I looked at the photo its signed CK

http://derpiboo.ru/159839
MadSurge: Aww <3
AppleBloom: Well, it's nice to know that he doesn't hate us.
But I do have to say, the content he used was pretty disgusting, IMO. :S
I didn't actually see the episode, so I dont know
This 4 day weekend is going to go by fast - going to the Aqaurium downtown for lunch with the family - Fish for Thanksgiving this year :) - Friday, I never do anything on "Black Friday" its a day to stay inside and do nothing - not sure what we're doing saturday & sunday
AppleBloom: Don't bother. It's...........weird.
AppleBloom: He basically used R34 art when he talked about us.
Cypresswolf: your lucky, I ork in retail and I gotta go in on friday :'(
Cypresswolf: Seems nice! :)
I used to work in retail - overnight grocery stocker at Walmart, earning money for college....7-8 years ago I think it was- lasted 7 months
http://derpiboo.ru/159750
AppleBloom: Reminds me of Rayman Origins when people got bubblized. :D
Cypresswolf: I work in a shoe store in california that sales these shoes called uggs (big state staple now) and they sell like crazy, gonna be hectic
AJIsAwesome: yeah they do look like that huh?
Worst part of that job was going to another walmart in downtown houston - Westheimer - me and 2 others had to help replace the floor in clothing, baby & shoe section with rubber wood matted panels...
sounds like I got the easy job, the shoes basically sell themselves
blue screen
AJIsAwesome: *chirp chirp chirp* :D
JRP2234: this would be my reaction to said screen. http://derpiboo.ru/159722
It was in a bad neighborhood - there was a police car out front with someone arrested in the back everynight when we arrived - shady people walking around with their hand wrapped up in thier shirt, like they were hiding something - I didnt set foot outside alone, only when we arrived and left together at the start and finish each night - killed working night shift for me
Many panks.

RawketLawnchair: that pronounciation, inequivocable :D
So hows everyone doin today?
I prefer Celestia, even though I like both princesses equally.

They already started a countdown? :S
AppleBloom: ?
RawketLawnchair: kinda :(
Whats so sad:I never played Castlevania

I prefer ALL PONYS!
Ronbow Dosh
DOSH! Catch it while ya can lad!
what was the name of that end of the world cult from my history classes....1837 or so I think it - a so called minister "did math from The Bible" came up with an end of the world date, and followeres were angry when nothing happened - they sold all their worldly poseessions waiting for it
End of the world? Bring it on.
I think they were... Jehovah's Witnesses :P
Does it really matter if the world ends? I dont care either way
I CANT STOP THE FLASH
D:
The_Engineer, there are no breaks on the Pinkie-train.
:) Best news about that is if the world keeps on spinning, we get to watch new ponies the next moring on the 22nd
Time to pop out chat
>:D
The_Engineer: I just closed the window.
OH MAI GAWD
my new puppy just farted, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?
Not me.
AppleBloom he had gas. DUH!
AppleBloom: Because puppies have to fart? :D

Cypresswolf, like I said, there are no breaks on the Pinkie-train.
PINKIE PIES!!!

Oh wait, I've been using the wrong "brakes" the whole time >.<

Kids and getting on during school, honestly.
You have all the time in the world after and before school.

It's not that laggy is it? o.o

It seems normal for me :$, but that might be because I'm used to it due to Australian ping
What's up?
Nothing much.
SUP, Hazard!
Same. Happy Thanksgiving by the way.
im helping my grandmother today :>
Happy Thanksgiving to you too, Hazard. :)
Merry Thanksgiving and a happy Black friday
aniderp: No way! Me too. No joke.
^
This
Jmo, oh you :$
i been helping her since i was 8
No shit.
Where was purple dude?
What exactly is this? :o
Planetside 2
Pokecolt, Planetside 2.
Thanksgiving originated back in the 1700s where the Pilgrims, or the Puritans (or was it Seperatists?) landing at Plymouth Rock, Massachussets and founded the colony there for the London Company.
Something that we can't talk about for some reason.
What do you mean can't talk about?
Like, no spoilers or something? -tad confused-
First few minutes we said nothing.
So, anyone have Assassin's Creed 3?
Nope.
^
Revolutionary war BI***ES!
I recommend it. Freaking awesome.
Anyone have the Wii U.
I wish I did.
One of these guys are breathing pretty hard. .o.
I wish. Mario all day all night long.
Lucky you. :D
And I can't wait for Pikmin 3!
Pikmin for life <3
I have gotta run now, take care, I'll see you in a couple of hours :)
I got assassin creed Digitual deluxe on pc :D
This looks like call of duty and halo's child of a game right here.
Yeah, they did the naval warfare REALLY well.
Brovakiin|School, have fun with your edumacation :P
Bye, Brovakiin|School. :)
Later Brovakiin l School
AdamTheDuck: I will :3
TIME TO INSTALL ASSASSIN CREED 3 :D
Or maybe I liked it so much because I only ever played AC Revelations? And that was only for about twenty minutes.
Not gunna lie.
I was shocked Brotherhood was as good as it was.
Side games like AC brotherhood and revelations normally don't excite me too much.
Pokecolt, ... CoD...
/me dies a little inside
THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT! Are we saying abything relevant to what's on screen.
Like I said, it's like halo + cod child, more halo than cod. :P
Just the fighting play in my opinion.
Looks like Battlefield and a little bit of Halo.
^
Yeah, that one makes a bit of sense, haven't really seen anything out of vehicle warfare.
So I can't judge whether it's more cod or battlefield yet. :P
So what am I watching and who's streaming? :3
Halo Reach is my favorite Shooters but thats not saying much because I don't like shooters that much. I like Platformers. Mainly Sonic the Medgehog and Mario.
Battlefield is fun. I've only played 1943, but it was fun enough to say that the others were as well. But seeing the BO2 gameplay, I have to say it looks fucking horrible.
oni_link, Planetside 2 with Wrek and Sumi :P
Planetside 2 and Sumica's streaming I think. :)
AJfan77: I've never heard of a Medgehog. :D
AdamTheDuck and AJISAwesome ah thanks, it took longer than normal to load
I think he meant 'Mingemong'.
AJIsAwesome : I bucking hate my computer.
Doesn't BF3 have friendly fire?
SO its a awesome three way blend between the 3?
Hazard, it does, but only on custom and hardcore servers
Hazard: it does in hardcore
ah right, PC has few hardcore games
Wrek, there are a few hardcore servers
Hazard : I meant Hedgehog
Although I haven't checked BF3 in a while >.>
So this is HC BF3 mixed with Halo?
Upscaled by ten?
Hazard: and with the fast pace part of COD if that makes sense
Hazard, no not really, bullet thethality is closer to normal rather than hardcore.
lethality*
Sumica you have a cold?
I said it reminds me of halo cause of the base set up and the technology level.
When was this released by the way? It looks like it could be released today and be praised for it's graphics.
More dakka
Not to mention that 4 wheeler looked like it controlled exactly like a mongoose. xD
Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
Hi, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
Hi DoctoDoctorWho :P
Hi everypony
That map is HUGE.
DoctoDoctorWho: Blame AdamTheDuck. :P
Its called Forge World in Halo.
Hazard, exactly, now there's 3 continents :P
I am npt amused this morning.
not*
Poor diddums.
Not amused DoctoDoctorWho is not amused.
How many people in a game on here?
It would take me FOREVER to explore that map.
Pokecolt: with the camera right?? XD
Pokecolt, a couple hundred on each 3 factions
Heya everypony!
Not just the camera, it's controlling was just like the mongoose as well. :3
Hello SafariMonkey
Hi, SafariMonkey. :)
http://www.theuniversalsolvent.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/We-are-Not-Amused.jpg
Like, on how hard it can turn, etc.
Hazard: and it looks fun
It does.
How long do these games normally last on this? xD
I suck at shooters.
AdamTheDuck: I believe it's 666, 667, 667 so more than a couple hundred.
Pokecolt: yeah like you literally turn with the camera right?
Pokecolt, the games don't end, the 3 factions constantly fight for resources and land
ohai all
AdamTheDuck: so its a persistant game??
Hey PrincessLuna
Oh god
Hello PrincessLuna
Hi, PrincessLuna. :)
Here it comes
Burn it with fire before it spreads
This sound fucking amazing. I really need to get this game.
oni_link, a never ending war.
Jmo: The bombs?
oni_link: Yeah, like that but it's not just halo that controls like that. I was talking about the vehicle itself.
So, Im sleeping right? Well my sister thought it was funny to get an alarm that NEVER SHUTS UP.
What are the 3 continents
how is everypony?
Pokecolt: oh yeah lol
DoctoDoctorWho: Ouch.
Hi PrincessLuna
AJfan77, there's a snow, desert and forrest continent.
Lamp Oil? Rope? Bombs?
Alarm Clocks are alarming.
forest*
Hello everypony :)
AJIsAwesome: You Want it?
Heya BoroBrony
Hello BoroBrony
It's yours, my friend. As long as you have enough rubies.
HI, BoroBrony. :)
So after tolerating it FOR AN HOUR, I finally stormed in there and unplugged the damn thing.
XD
AJIsAwesome: Took the words right out of my mouth.
long time no see how is everypony :)
Sorry AJIsAwesome, I don't give credit. Come back when you're a little MMMMM richer.
BoroBrony: Good. How about you? :)
Just fine BoroBrony.
I think I'm going back to bed. Very tired. SEE YAH!
Goodnight Haz-gone.
Am good been busy but good AJIsAwesome, AdamTheDuck
BoroBrony, and I got my final exams tomorrow yay :3
Worst part? Sister's not even here, shes away for thanksgiving and forgot to turn the blasted thing off.:[
yay good luck AdamTheDuck :)
OK guys, I gotta go alteady, my personal statement still needs some work.
ooh is this planetside 2?
I had a black out last night so I missed lego starwars :|
Bye, SafariMonkey. :)
See ya
Bye SafariMonkey
So in short Im not amused this morning.
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah that sucks :I
see ya AdamTheDuck
So how do you claim land
AJfan77, each piece has some "cap" point, take the 1 to 4 points in each to start claiming land.
oni_link: so hows your day been?
watching this i may play some PS2
What if one continent gets all the land in the unlikely time that it does.
DoctoDoctorWho: not bad by comparison. I just came back from an evening out with some friends and liquor. :P
Ah, I dont drink.
AJfan77, it does, and if they do, that faction has a momentary bonus for as long as they hold the continent.
DoctoDoctorWho: You're better off but regardless, my night went as planned.
GO TR time to go play some PS2
BerryPunch, i'ma have to sened you to alcoholics anon if you dont stop
Phase4: best thing I've heard all night XD
^
I dont have many personal codes, but drugs/alchohol and suicide are among my unbreakables.
Wrek, does the Stalker rifle come with sights or a scope?
i am goning to play some Dayz
holy crap, steams selling RAGE for $5
say what
good deal
Hmm, I heard so many bad things about RAGE >.<
RoboGerbil: Rage made me rage, hated that game.
well for $5 how could anything possibly go wrong?
What do you guys think of Warface?
yeah its ok i got it on xbox
RoboGerbil, and thus, Steam murders another innocent wallet
witcher 2 for $12
oni_link: That didn't convince me! Now show your real Warface!
AJIsAwesome: XD But do you know what I'm talking about?
No. :D
I want to watch fullmetal jacket now...
Like a nicer darksouls

borderlands 2 for $30
AJIsAwesome: lol damn

AdamTheDuck: Well yeah if you put it that way. Its their attempt at F2P

Heh, Skrillex got a song in BO2.
BoroBrony: :O
XAX: wow really?
I really enjoy all the dubstep in black ops 2.
oni_link: Yeah, you go to a club in one of the missions.
I am proud that black ops 2 is finally aiming their music towards the audience that plays their game.
._.
XAX: lol
DoctoDoctorWho: Famine should be skinnier.
Halo 4 is better than Black ops 2
Please...
Neither are good, so go sit in the corner child.
AJfan77: U startin, m8?
Pokecolt: I didn't think that was such a big deal
:'(
Keep the *x* game is better than *y* game arguments out. Please.

Yes sir
Music plays a larger part in gaming than you think oni_link. :P
Go to bed Adam
Jmo: I don't mind either because I have low standards huehue.

Past your bedtime
RawketLawnchair: War shouldnt be giving us bedroom eyes but Im not complaining.

Don't make me beat you to sleep.

You have spiders, Jmo?
I am not craving a double cheeseburger from mcd's.

I'm from Australia, what do you think kiwi?
Legit.

I have a spider family living on my ceiling.
^
And I have a giant boot.
Pokecolt: I know, that's why I thought it was such a surprise that it mattered to you. I like the game's score if it its orchestral but it fills you with the emotion of the scene or what ever they chose for that part because thats what they thought was best.
my gooooood so excited
I wish I could have something relative to new zealand. A kea would be a mean pet, because they're cheeky cunts.

Jmo: LOADSAMONEY

Dosh here.
Grab it while it's hot
My one problem with black ops 2 is it feels like the gameplay is like that of assasin's creed games. Where they go back in time and reminisce on part wars or moments in time. That's my issue with the black ops campaigns, even though they are really enticing.
Munnay munnay munnay
lol wut
Sweet juicy DOSH
