YES!! TTGL IS AWESOME!!
*do
:P
:(
Let's watch porn.
If you say TTGL is an amazing anime..
............
.I lose interest in talking to you :P
XD
kan you vote for itske on this site http://giel.vara.nl/fileadmin/static/Win-kaarten-voor-One-Direction.1114.0.html
There's 2 animes types
Juiced?
You mean like, hyperkinetic and over-the-top?
bleh
Yeah.
It's a long way off, though
It has it's own style, which I applauds for
oh okay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrR42Fvg7I
On One Piece?
I dropped One Piece shortly after the timeskip.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN_rI8VM3bw
and SZS
i watched Bleach for some eps
I don't doubt Oda-sensei's storytelling abilities, but he's overdoing everything in it to the point that nothing stands out.
It's its own Anime, heck even meta anime
lost interest at 84 i thought
I prefer shorter anime now, anyway.
XD
TTGL has a lot of subtle moments.
One Piece.... does not.
My top 5 favorite anime are all under 50 episodes long.
XD
TTGL and NGE are my fav animes
i only watch none piece
Bobobobo Bobobo is best fighting anime :D
#1 favorite anime is cLANNAD.
Hello
!cd
#2 favorite anime is Puella Magi Madoka Magica.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-zhIImKP5k Aww, I was just about to mention CLANNAD
yeah
#3 favorite anime is Gurren Lagann.
!cd is the only thing #bronystate is good for
#5 favorite anime is Ai Yori Aoshi.
Or is it just whichever the mods are on when they stream?
I've never seen AYA.
Yw.
some people are telling me to watch elfen lied and evangilon or something like that

I tried watching Claymore, kinda dropped it when they mentioned only the women had superpowers
Oh.
OH.

Lame anime

If you're done and you want to spawn a hundred dragons in Markath and then chop through them all with untamed vengeance, fair enough, but it only seems like you're denying yourself gameplay challenge.

dddgh
Turns out this was a stupid idea. Who'd have guessed.
i summon YOU!
Everything ends and begins with the Simpsons
turn the chain into a sword using item.spawn ripple and you'll be fine!

09,01he deflected most of the blow
?

Blopsii...
Wat...
the most impresive about that clip is that he managed to get r34 aired on tv
http://cheezburger.com/6773403136
aside from that i really don't care
in that case it sucks alltoghether
The comments were funnier
did the same with "2 Girls 1 Cup"
showed the audience watching it
and again with some girl popping a huge cyst on a guy's back
and I mean HUGE
eww

Goign to sleep, Goodnight everyone
but it's shown unedited at the studio
still not sued? no concerned parents or something?
Parents???
Comedy Central being sued by parents
you think responsible parents watch a show like that with their kids?
you mean concerned soccer moms
:P
that hasn't happen since South Park about 10 years agi
whatever
ago
Luck auduance...
when it was shown during the afternoon
christians? the hate everything and sue everyone
no thats apple
like how you mentioned just one when all the religions do it
also, victim complex
Like atheists dont ever play the victim
Good night
it's because atheists don't have any "religious" beliefs to get offended on
I liked the studio audience's reaction. AWWWWW :3
g'night cc-

Oops
Oh right

Great fitting song.
halp

The fact you're even on at school boggles my mind.
Kids and getting on during school, honestly.
You have all the time in the world after and before school.

I like how none of us are saying anything.
laggy
whole net is lagging in both browers :\
/me puts on his Groucho glasses and ponders
It's not that laggy is it? o.o
its where i am,,
Look up there is a helicopter
SHOOT IT
What's up?
Nothing much.

This
Roll on America, roll on.
i been helping her since i was 8
No shit.
Where was purple dude?
Planetside 2
Something that we can't talk about for some reason.
Like, no spoilers or something? -tad confused-
First few minutes we said nothing.
^
Revolutionary war BI***ES!
I recommend it. Freaking awesome.
Anyone have the Wii U.
I wish I did.
One of these guys are breathing pretty hard. .o.
And I can't wait for Pikmin 3!
I have gotta run now, take care, I'll see you in a couple of hours :)
Yeah, they did the naval warfare REALLY well.
Not gunna lie.
I was shocked Brotherhood was as good as it was.
Side games like AC brotherhood and revelations normally don't excite me too much.
/me dies a little inside
Like I said, it's like halo + cod child, more halo than cod. :P
Just the fighting play in my opinion.
Looks like Battlefield and a little bit of Halo.
^
Yeah, that one makes a bit of sense, haven't really seen anything out of vehicle warfare.
Battlefield is fun. I've only played 1943, but it was fun enough to say that the others were as well. But seeing the BO2 gameplay, I have to say it looks fucking horrible.
Planetside 2 and Sumica's streaming I think. :)
I think he meant 'Mingemong'.
Although I haven't checked BF3 in a while >.>
Upscaled by ten?
lethality*
I said it reminds me of halo cause of the base set up and the technology level.
When was this released by the way? It looks like it could be released today and be praised for it's graphics.
More dakka
