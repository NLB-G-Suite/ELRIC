Translating these names? SURELY YOU JEST
00,10enough of that =p
and back :D
suddenly japanese again
aw :<
and back to singinh BG
/me is pleased by this
^
yeah
for like, 6 years
on cartoon network
and
I've only watch up to the second adventure
they dont make animes like this anymore
I only watched the first episodes
I dunno. The aesthetic of Digimon still doesn't appeal to me.
Digimon season 1 and 02 where the best
taichi tachi
Oh this theme..........
OH NO, A SEA
00,10sorry no english opening though
00,10both tracks use butterfly
I imagine wearing sunglasses while listening to this............<3
awwww
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Hello everyone
'Lo T.
hi
Ipersonally always likes S3-- Tamers-- the best. It was kind of quirkier, and in a strange way more eralistic.
hay TGaPT
WTF ok
*realistic.
/me wears sunglasses while listening to this......
hai everypony! :$
I wish........
I didn't watch past adventure 1
YOU'RE NOT TWILIGHT, you can't wish!
. after that, it went downhilltamers was awesome too
whoops
i jumbled something
well yeah, tamers was pretty much the last good season
english opening
<3
00,10there
WHA______:D
whoo
?
Digimon Garlic Champions.
and THIS is CRAP
sure, why not
Never unheard that.
Any luck Saturn?
00,10it's just the openings
woah this theme song this isnt calming at all like the chinese version
i cant believe springer would stoop that low
owait
Gotta admit it's catchy
yes i can
:(
... seriously? that is the english opening? that doesn't even sound like a coherent song :/
ikr
PAINFULLY CATCHY
^
Japanese openings > English openings.
oh g2
That drill dude was pretty spiff though c|
Besides, the first three seasons used the SAME FREAKING song!
although, screw dna digivolving
00,10such a varaity of themes
IKR? :D
Altough the third one used a more punk-ish feel.
XD
Creative bunch aren't they.
looking back on these intros, each one is trying to make itself look more historic than the invasion of Normandy.
>.<
oh look, they changed some of the lyrics
make it stop ;_;
that epic intro
00,10and then this travisty
and suddenly
shite
lawl
although
Suddently, this opening!
:D
the lyrics are horrifically catchy
but the music :(
... Leb deinen Traum, denn er wird wahr... :'(
Oh, it's that fox monster thing
I never EVER listened to this one
:O
sudenly the horible digimon
oh yea, sorta remember this, but it was ony basic tv
:D
this one's kinda fine
...In my opinions though.
i wanna go back to the first theme
...I regret that they learned the meaning of creativity.
PFFF Star Trek Enterprise was the most chill opening |3
00,10and then
hi
wat
this wasnt actually that bad
there was a g5?
no
G5 was when I stopped watching :/
Never watched this one...:S
......when did this happen?
00,10there is even a g6
Wow, they grew up and passed driving school eh?
G6?
Oh this was the one where the kid could digipunch shit isn't it.
also, police digimon
was wierd
Wait
seriously wth
Police Digimon?
00,10well we ready for springer?
05,15YEAAH
YES
Again, good opening, but Season 5 was the shittiest of them all.
Dari

00,10they did shit for reaserch
Dude...
:D
Springer...
Oh wow. That caused me physical pain.
05,15That wasn't nearly as much fun as I thought it'd be :(
00,10it's gauker, to be expected
Rainbow Dash with a horn?
WAT?
idk
Rainbow Dash...with the horn of a unicorn?
srsl, no words
05,150/10 would not buy from again
It was a 2 at tops.
HAHAHA this was like Italian tv
*srsly
Don't know if it 20% Cooler, or just plain wrong.
Holla everypony! :)
But since you could tell they were bad actors, -18546/10
Would want to throw in the garbage.
that was ridicolous xD
hi
00,10now some good openings
Suddenly Riff
YES! BUTTERFLY!
Dat guitar riff
well, nothing to get upset about really, even if they were actors or not, I see no reason to be mad about it
this song is childhood!
05,15VenHur....suuuuuure
And thus why I loved you guys.
05,15Not you guys
<.< This isn't the Digimon theme?
/me hugs everypony
/me <.< goes to shower then make ponies

Trust me.
But the intro is the G1 or G2...
Tonnes of drama and attention whores.
This song is NEITHER
I tracked doewn both Digimon Soundtrack CDs fot the Songs >.<
cya

I WON'T GO THERE though
05,15^
Saturn isnt THAT bad
pretty much
hes supprising normal
It's not that Saturn is bad, he's just a very huggy person.
And I don't like hugs
:D
00,10yeah but i dont see you all acting as nutters either =p
Thanks. :P
00,10liked this opening
You know, I'll confess something. Before, I wasn't ever interested in this whole Digimon thing, but after seeing this I'll admit, there's some cool creatures there.
OH I remember this song!
running to the left, as always
just whatever you do
unless you like being embarrassed
with nothing to say
Biggest Dreamer :) a really good song too :)
because Saturn said to
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME MORE
NAO
Yeah, that pannel was really fun. >_>
well, all my friends somehow saw it
05,15Yup
hi-
and with this one i stoped watching digimon
00,10F was odd cause they did't have digimon partners
Digimon series lost me here
F was where they were avatars to digimon right?
Totally not awkward at all. <_<
If I would go up or not depends on the situation. :P But I would decide the outcome of either choice.
lies.
THAT ISN'T SATURN
00,10shall we go back to the show now?
Sure.

No wait. It's called Biomerging, sorry...
oh they had a second intro?

05,15YEAH
