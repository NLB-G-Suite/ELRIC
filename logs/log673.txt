/me Crystaline_Shard: i forgot to draw the tail "im so frusturated i could just *Squee*
Reverb, there you go, Kinixys knows whats up.
/me melts from PeachStreak's squee.
/me adds more leaves to Zuxxez123.
twilight_sprinkle: aye

THE MOST FRUSTRATEING THING
^^
Unnr|Angst tweeners are cool, not many can do, but smah lob-nobody can do..
Can
they taste really bad
This game was "fun" to beat with a desktop keyboard
Can't have enough leaves.
REALLY BAD
And over?
/me adds flowers too so Zuxxez123 doesn't get hungry.
"and over and over and over" thats why i dont like games lke this
Aww, you are so kind Kinixys.
/me Zuxxez123: the power of the *Squee* is to great to handle
The smash lob was what, the US Open in '08?
Is there a stream

But everything else is set. :3
Zuxxez123: What's your cuuuutie mark?
lmao I Dont Even Play Barbie Horse Adventures :D
Unnr|Angst: but yeah, his backhand smash lob at the net was an example of the level of improvization he can do. but yeah i need to work on my game to, unfortunately nobody to play with here..
Kinixys: Still thinking of a way to make an image for my cuuuuutie mark. :P
egawd
twilight_sprinkle: T__T
SMB makes you insane, by definition. :P
I had a partner, but they graduated
now no-one to play with
Zuxxez123: Why is it a 4d shape?
lol
Unnr|Angst: they dont even have a tennis wall here. they say i cant play on the racketball walls..
Kinixys: How would you make an image for someone that is compassionate, trustworthy, is easily apporachable and whose friends feel open enough to talk to and serious problems and try and fix them through reasonible thinking?
Get a racketball racket and practice? Its not the same but at least the motions are similar
NewSuperBronyU: Is your cutie mark a meat splat? I'm just making conversation...
Unnr|Angst: are they expensive?
pffffffffffflololo
NewSuperBronyU: getting philosophical in here.
dat joke
Dat reference.
A 4D Shape Is Not Something That We Can Imagine In Our Way Of Thinking. Us Being 3D Beings, Cannot Possibly Imagine That Which We Have 0 Experiance IN, yES?
4D? Get Carl Sagen up in here.
/me dances into chat

taoumi: yay! Do more ponies :D
its time for rocket enginering!

makeing an alicorn pattern was slightly more involved then i had thought
Yo phase4 on your chat screen there does my name show dark red on there or does it show bright red?
im not even sure this will work...
Moopy, it shows exactly as it does on stream
Hmmm thats weird cause it looks like wreks color to me
Avast which ponies ass?
Moopy: when he gets pinged the text always looks dark red
Oh ojk
I mean ok
Dang what is up with my messed up texted word chats jeeze
o-o
nice wiring...
and now to stage
will this fail.. or fail epicly..
Dat Touhou
Phase4: You do know that without stabilizing wings your basically throwing a paper towel roll up in the air right?
Mega_Milk, i'll be fine
Hey phase4 i beleave that whole rocket that your making i thinks its going to do a mess up
Riiiight -lol
Mega_Milk: but that's the fun part! :D
i never had stabalizing on my rocket and i mange to get up to space..
Moopy, read your sentence
Ugh...............sorry dude
MadSurge: If that rocket could speak it would be saying "Kill me"
108 fuel tanks
11,02Phase4 is a silly moo :D
^
Phase4: Yeah........This is gonna freakin sweet -lol
Mega_Milk: well, it will commit suicide then :D

00,10I am hapy you are looking forward to it but i am still meh on it
im surprrse it launch at all..
whats amazing is its not a slow rocket
That thing is chugging fuel :D
11,02But...it has Mass Effect 3 :<
im still surpise it goes to straight line..
Dang phase4 thats alot of lag
i expect to be going around
Moopy, ikr
Thats what amazes me too
Its going straight
anson kermin is scared
00,10I already has mass effect 3
cant imagine why
I figured it would have coreened into the ocean by know -lol
11,02Wii U will be the console that will end PC gaming once and for all \:D/
Sumica: Ehhhh.......the ending....why....
Mega_Milk, you underestimate me
should I install back my ME3..
Phase4: *bows to sensei phase4*
Hey NewSuperBrony
11,02Hai Moopy :3
almsost time to stage
If only you had Fortresscraft i would show you something for everypony
That cant be good for he ozone. Meh.
i was actually expecting that to explode
this is a nice suprise
still spinning in a straight line
00,10go to sleep super, vlearly your lack of sleeping has damaged your brain
come on
little faster
11,02i liek silly though \o.o/
damn this thing is heavy
00,10besides no KSP on wiiU ergo it sucks
Phase4 I will be really surprise if that rocket reach the moon..
^
LightTrooper105, it'll reach the moon
Sumica, i cant disagree with that
11,02Killer Super Paranas? o.o
Oh NewSuperBrony how many microsoft points do you have in your hard drive?
i mean literally land there..
LightTrooper105, is that a chalenge?
11,02Moopy: That doesn't make sense o.o
maybe...
Phase4: does the Pinkie Pie still work?
Chalenge accepted
MadSurge, eyup
YES :D
probably need to add more rocket
lol
How does that not make any sense? its just a xbox question
these engines really dont have enough power
And look at phase's speed. Hes moving at 3......My god.....
Moopy, 'microsoft points' are not stored on the hard drive
they're attached to a microsoft account
lol
00,10reminds me of the ToP Phase4
00,10that thing was so heavy it used to hang at like 7km
of the what?
*SIGH*
ah
00,10Tower of Power
Sumica, i should try import that into 0.17
it could totaly make duna
00,10would be better to just remake
now that would be a flight
00,10lets see if I can throw one together
00,10perhaps refine it a bit
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Two Best Sisters Play: Resident Evil 4

oh god this autopilot is stupid

00,10awwwww
00,10bufffers
hello CrimsonPhoenix
lol
look likes it going out of controll..
hi NewSuperBronyU
ya know I remember a time when Sumica was playing KSP and Phase4 entered the chat wondering what was the monstrosity on screen... I think they've switched places XD
XD
00,10oh I still make them just phas is better at rockets then I am
sumi is much better at planes
Sumica is better at making explosions :D
00,10the trick is to not care for the pilots
lol
i lost a lot of speed during that mid launch flip
this may or may not make it
either way its gona be a long burn
i recomend packing a sandvich
Moar Dakka! I mean rocket
00,10never let things like pilot safty and it's too heavy get in the way of science
im just still waiting for it to land on the moon :P
hmm, only 3 degrees out
not bad for eyeballing it
ok, this will escape kerbin
00,10made a refined and highly optmistic lander module for the new ToP
protip: mechjeb is useless
XD its acceleration was matched to kerbins for a while there
so i'ma go do some stuff while this burns slowly
Nah nah nah nah
and ohai everyone again

Mega_Milk, true
CrimsonPhoenix: most don't realize thats out just yet... even after I linked
this things never going to hit eve
00,10Phase4, this thing I am building is almost amazing in it's geonomic stupidity

Sumica: save it for later showing! :D
00,10I will
00,10still got a long way to go
huh
00,10only one leg done and a tone of stageing
mechjeb must be terribly confused
Sumica: werent you the one that made the giant rocket that flipped upside down and flapped its way into space?
on giant wings?
00,10somthing like that
what is mechjeb doing
00,10oh god the cliping, this thing is a bomb waiting to happen.
Spectrum_Rush, that's a shame
00,10oh and it's atomic

how are you even worried about how something is going to work anymore?
OH BOY DAFT PUNK
00,10it has 54 SRB's
and now I remember that vid Sumica streamed
Sumica, how can your computer run that
00,10we shall see
DeadpoolDash, is it simply because the sword is named "Twilight"? :D
yes and it looks badass
00,10it did't blow up on the pad.
the sister sword to is is Sunrise http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunrise
Sumica, you want stream back for a bit to show it?

LightTrooper105, nah

Enough... Rockets?...
Phase4.
challenge fail..
I've told you this
prefferably more rocket
There are never enough rockets.
LightTrooper105, well i can get it to the mun easy
but it would take a long time
00,10arc de flaminko
yeah i know
a VERY long time
00,10ff 9
we're talking 1.5 hours
i know Phase4 i play the game before
THIS COMPUTER WILL BURN IN THE FIRES OF RAGE AND TORMENT!!!
LightTrooper105, a normal mun misson is 0.5 hours
depending on transfer method
and landing
indeed
could bring it all the way down to 10 minutes with mechjeb
Phase4, http://fav.me/d3g8qm8 :3
as soon as it stops lagging.:(
out of my 10 rocket... at least 3 made it to the moon and 1 can land on the moon

What? lol
o.o
CrimsonPhoenix, ._. Really?
I dont see that O_o
AdamTheDuck, you cannot imagine the number of post I saw that says Flutterdash comfirmed
Shipping, bleh.
just because of that scene
applebloom hat is best hat
CrimsonPhoenix: glad I am a fan then :D
Sumica, holy
Sumica, you broke mono's garbage collector
i am impress
00,10lolwut?
I mean I'm ok with shipping and all, heck I favorite Green in FiMFicition
Sumica: It is widely accepted that the theoretical state of "too much dakka" is physically impossible. This implies that the state of "enough dakka" is equally impossible, as adding any more to "enough" creates "too much". Therefore, there is always room for More Dakka
:)
but the comments about that scene alone are a joke
good bye everypony you guys made my first time here magical :3 and lots of fun
DoctoDoctorWho, why are you thinking like an orc?
Oh you were new pony_3274? :3
yes
Welcome then to BronyState :P

thanks
wait for the wall o' text...
CrimsonPhoenix: that's not ork thinking, Ill show you ork thinking
00,10as I said, you have not seen me build
DoctoDoctorWho, its not 'too much daka', its 'the universe is insufficent to contain the daka'
YAY KILLING FUN :D
Ah the joy of murder :D
CrimsonPhoenix: AN' DERE AIN'T NO SUCH FING AS ENUFF DAKKA, YA GROT! Enuff'z more than ya got an' less than too much an' there ain't no such fing as too much dakka. Say dere is, and me Squiggoff'z eatin' tonight!

Sumica: O__O

00,10also it seems my rocket is too heavy to withstand the pull of gravity.
oh hey anyone play that mlp online yet?

I was the best house of the night when my street still had kids getting free candy - most I ever got was 5 - I gave out 2 full handfulls each - and only 1 kid ever complained :| "That's It?" - What do you mean "That's It?" you got half a bag of candy FROM ONE HOUSE! Ungrateful Whelp :D

Bye Ponies47
I know VB, too bad its useless :/
Yeah it is
strange
that did not do what i expected
IcY_, vb is bad language
IcY_, learn python
I only know it because of school
python or ruby, ruby tends to be more 'friendly'
they can choose any language in the course, so they chose the most useless one
Bye Ponies47
I mean applying the logic to other languages is possible, but I'm not patient enough :P

You want him to be hurt, don't you AdamTheDuck.

Copying is what they do best
I'm setting up Fast and The Furious cars in forza 4
oh and sueing, they are good at that too
I've only got forza 3, cant justify getting the new one
even though it is cheap as now

ofna01, it will happen
just a matter of time
doesn't it take like a month to get to mars?
Why not ofna01?

Barbetos it was pretty elementary
The best part? That was the longest it ever took Sherlock to deduce the identity of some one behind a mask.
Much to Batmans benefit I guess.
Dat kill noise :D

i need to find this mods dev and yell at him
DUMMKOPS
Phase4 Por que?
when you screw with physics or input or anything to do with motion
you ADD THE MODS TO THE CLIENT AS WELL
when your testing localy and have zero ping its fine
but when you have a nonzero ping everything breaks
its INCREDIBLY anoying having all these mods where the devs do not care
Twilight!
Everything buy da book yo.
:D
go twilight fighting music lol
dat complainer
I blinked & missed it - what happened?
There was nothing to see
By the time phase loaded in it was over
MadSurge! RE6 @_@
:D
Cypresswolf: only two people against Twily
WallDives: what about it?
nuuuuhhh!!
one 111
lol did some one just say "cheat" ? XD
MadSurge, only played through the first chap of Leon/Helena on Vet. Surprisingly difficult.
Hello I think you might be new here.

Kind of creepy to imagine what exactly a Changling AJ would do as a job.
Later Lyra|atwork!
Bye Lyra|atwork
Seeing as the normal one harvests apples.
I've only played through Leon/Helena, and we were freaking pretty hard. (we were also drunk). Most controls are OK, lot more freedom, more fluid, but minor control issues.
Barbetos: buck food for the captives, of course
gonna have to go back outside and start clearing the metal pipe O_o
eventually
Cypresswolf I'm gonna expect that there's already a fanfic for those changelings there
:) If you find a good one, let me know
hello everyone :)
MadSurge still creepy.

Hi Lil_B
Hiya Lil_B !

Goodnight Ske-gone
Cypresswolf its always morning/afternoon some where
:D No Stream? Press A to throw self out window
hello
Anyways timez for works. And to answer question, yes. Staying up 18 to 24 hours of awake time followed by 6 hours of sleep is the best.
To bad I can't do that crap any more
hello DaringDerpy
Bye Barbetos
/me 's bronystate log is so big that it cant be oppened....
Hello DaringDerpy
Rain that's good ... I guess ... means we communicate a lot :P
its over 9 months old x3
i got the game yesterday and my car is already an R2 6_9
and it is 5 times larger than any of my other logs (not joking)
they removed amy and rorry from the show?
what show
dr who
lol rorry
wasnt the latest season supposed to be the dr and river?
Doctor is part of his name. its not a title ><
Doctor Who. =/= Dr. Who
but he has jesus like healing powers
wow
my Skyline is an R3 :P
only for himself, DaringDerpy :p
no stream?
RoboGerbil, nope
Just enjoy the buffer show~
quick post ponies www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0
Lol
http://chainsawsuit.com//comics/20120613.png
xD
I don't get that comic...
He just wakes up and "thinks" he's a brony?
Dafuq...?
he lies in bed and realizes that he is one of them
Ah...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59739LrJfYE
there we go
so it was different for you, rdash?
deleted every single log for bronystate
because I honestly dont give a crap about those old memories.
DaringDerpy: what do you mean?
they certianly are no help to me now and would only cause me personal issues :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HudCIt-AuvE
rdash: how you got into all this here
DaringDerpy: eh, for me personally, I
Really became a brony because I decided one day just to sit down and watch the show
RoboGerbil ah, a pretty good sparta mix
/me is trying to think of an OC in order to reaffirm his broniness.
I had heard so much about it, and decided, ya know what there has to be something behind all this hype online
Aww Rain, is everything alright? :(
So I watched a few episodes, and immediately my inner child poked though and I felt happy with watching the show \o/
this just made you someone who watched the show, rdash
Dken2021: i thought it could be better but its the only one on youtube
now you are on bronystate :P
the new season starts on november. all bronyness will be restored then.
Oh yes, definitely
I can't wait ^_^
after 1.5 years being a brony gets ol… oh ;-;
I hope season 3 can inspire more music again :<
I will complain about every single episode on ponychan ^^
Right now all my favourite artists hardly upload anything new anymore....
season 1 will never come again
I will complain about how corporate this new season will be
>implying TheLivingTombstone, WoodenToaster, and all the other awesome brony artists aren't pumping out music at least once a week...
I don't listen to them
Awwwww, you should...
Well WoodenToaster yes, but mostly the remixes
but the first year of the fandom produced the most material
most culture
DaringDerpy: we still might get awesomeness though :$
"Culture"...
some of the old projects and websites are defunct now
I hope so, MadSurge
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEc-BZaPGA8 this musician has some talent
:)
DaringDerpy: You might have noticed, I tend to see the glass always half full :)
DaringDerpy, hehe I love Dissonace :3
ance*
Gotta love that laugh at 2:40ish :3
MadSurge: optimists exist so people like me can tell them "I told you so"
the laugh is great
Half full, half empty, I like to see it as there is 125 ml of water.
DaringDerpy: and we exist to tell you "see? Everything went better than you expected" :P
and then I call you a communist :P
DaringDerpy, you listened to his steampunk'd works? :3
DaringDerpy: :D that's CCCP silly
Assuming it's a he.
no, not at all. he wrote under the youtube post this were his first attempt in electronic material
Octovler, what do you mean by "corporate"?
MadSurge: :)
DaringDerpy, Warriors of the Balloon is... nice too :3
Strangly lovely.
Orchestral with a deep bass is ftw
Kandarihu: When its clear that selling new toys comes first. Crystal Ponies and more Cadance.
Where is the Octavia toys? :<
All I want is Octavia...
I have an octavia figure on my desk. It's my only pony toy
Octovler, okay. That's what I know as "toyetic". Is that how you see Transformers Beast Wars?
Octovler Oi that's S3 speculation
AdamTheDuck: and then you'll put her with the Vynil toy :D
www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dva7MjGnCpw
Togetic? I like that pokemon.
Somehow, I missed Beast Wars entirely what channel was it on?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mabgvkoyLw Yay for steampunk \:3/
Hello everyone.
Ohai Meanwhile
Octovler I think it was on fox
hey Meanwhile
Octovler, it was best in syndication. Fox Kids censored it.
warriors of the balloon is...different
Chat moving at the speed of snail again?
DaringDerpy, strange, won't you say? :D
I don't know how I missed that show entirely. You sure it wasn't on cable?
Let me tell you this: Beast Wars was toyetic done right.
Octovler, it was mainly on Broadcast TV
not the kind of music I usually hear, AdamTheDuck
DaringDerpy, yeah it's very different
but worked well when I was killing zombies in Killing Floor XD
It was streamed a few months ago.
As long as all the current ponies aren't killed by Unicron followed by a G5 of ponies. (How is Transformers an A movie?)
Octovler, transformers is A due to budget
is otherwise shit movie
good
5 million, cult hit. It's straight up B
transformers is one of these cheap 20 minute commercials for cheap plastic dolls
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403703/ this is news to me
rdash, yeah, I just find Wooden Toaster's remixes so much better, but it's just personal taste. :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1lgTwdMw
Octovler, which transformers? i thought we ment the michael bay movie
havent seen the catoon one
The simple goodness of Beast Wars is that they got some good writers lined up, gave them character designs and just turned them loose. It's still a 30 minute commercial. But it's one of those GOOD commercials, in 30 minute chunks with nearly full continuity.
beast wars is excelent
The cartoon 80s movie is the one Mods are saying is A.
AdamTheDuck: I miss some structure in this piece of music. Guess you have to be a musician to get interested
Octovler, http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ it either was critically aclaimed or had a reletively high budget
mods are silly fillies
Then enjoy one more sone DaringDerpy before I sleep :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIwV23ta3I
http://derpy.me/Ix9JW Man, if this card existed at the time. This week's B movie would be 5 minutes long.
Good night everyone :P
Would an anime movie that was critically acclaimed qualify as an A movie?
night AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck: I think I heard this one quite often on internet radio stations
Octovler, no, they'de just get more card games done in the same timeslot
Oh is it? I don't listen to pony radios often~
AdamTheDuck: hm...not this version
Kandarihu if you can somehow get the budget for it and see how wel it did, probably, otherwise, it's a B
DaringDerpy, "Orchestral Version" :P
AdamTheDuck: yes, I see
heh, that Pudding isn't even my strongest card
Octovler, i seem to be disagreeing with you a lot, this cannot be allowed to pass
/me hugs Octovler
It's very easy to overload an orchestra
Seems so, that's why I like ApplejackTheEngineer's version :3
I think I prefer the original
DaringDerpy, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Jfctt1b8o
nuuuuu
/me hugs Phase4
nuuuuu
At least Pokemon the movie has a decent budget and huge box office returns
This one is more of a change then a direct orchestral remix
than*
sounds good so far
A while ago, I used to vote for One Piece Movie 10: Strong World as an A Movie.
Da'wwwwww Zerna fell asleep at the comp that's cute wish i had a web cam :/ morning everypony

Oh?
You're already glomping people :D
Lol. :D

Hiya there SKZR|Writing how's it going?
meh. Still pretty tired.
Hi, SKZR|Writing :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8umEcim69eA
I've been here for a while.
(as WallDives)
SKZR|Writing: been a sneaky ninja...
just in plain sight.
and in other places.
That's the best sight to hide in.
mmm, this apple butter is great on oatmeal , yum
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY_3uxzkoV4
How does apple butter taste?
Cypresswolf: I LOVED this show. :D
that... exists?
Yep.
Ello there everybrony.
Hi, Malavolent :)
Hello Malavolent
That Pete n Pete...
pretty nice, all I know is, probably gonna buy some more
hai Malavolent
So... what will we do until the november comes?
Who remembers this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WDjJOSCxyw
drink and do papers.
I'll be catching up on breaking bad
I saw the latter seasons before the show ended - loved it though :)
I think I'll be checking out Breaking Bad also. But I know I'll be feeling like a bandwagoner. xD
The last intro at 1:38 is the one I remember
and it appears i'm lagging due to network problems, ugh
brb
Hi everypony :) Engineer is here ;D?
hai The_Engineer
Hi, The_Engineer :)
hi The_Engineer
Hello The_Engineer how's it going?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Qj0xKvwGM - :)
Anyone wanna see my...art?
Its my first time drawing a pony
^^
Sure The_Engineer
I'd love to see it.
Its a base of fluttershy
of a photo I saw
I'm finishing the tail now :)
:)
How long have you been working on it?
Cypresswolf: I love it. Wish I could've lived in the 80s.
Hmmm I worked on it yesterday for a few minutes
I have more where that came from :) 1 moment
right now I think 20 because I suck at tail drawing
:P
Cypresswolf: That sounds wrong.
Anyway heres the link of the base of it: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8esm83LO1ri5dh4o1_1280.jpg
The_Engineer: I suck at drawing in general. (Maybe I should use the circle outline things...)
Its my first time so I might have bad accidents etc etc.
Malavolent: dont judge til I post it :P
HI!
Hi Kinixys
Cypresswolf: No, I mean that sentence.
Kinixys: Hey
Hi, Kinixys! :)
Hi Kinixys what's up?
hey Kinixys
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MknqHQYniuI
So what do you guys thing of my first pony drawing so far :) ?
/me runs up and glomps Kinixys
Cinemark policy trailers were AWESOME! I loved going to the movies just to see those ^)^
^_^
The_Engineer: It's nice. :)
The_Engineer: I'll be honest with ya. While the head looks ok, the body shape and legs do not. I think you should start with pony drawing tutorials, rather than drawing them from scratch.
Meh
I didnt draw fropm scratch
I tried copying one
of the internets :P
Oh the 80s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xSyVjkSib4
Yeah, that's what I meant, basically.
K
/me hugs Zuxxez123!
Dont expect me to be a goo--BRB Phone call
I need to get food now
/me is now afk.
The_Engineer: Try using this as a tutorial, I did the same thing as you. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blG244JdZ9U
Lol, my great timing at work ladies and gentlemen...
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: Wendy's actually did this? :S
Yes.
Thx for the warm welcome.
training video?
The first Wendys I technically worked at had those videos still
havent touched the link, but I'm assuming.
That was around 2003 or so
yep. Training vid.
On VHS
Awww yeaaah
:D
That VHS copy! :3
weeping_pegasi82: Cute :D
weeping_pegasi82: That's very nic.
*nice
weeping_pegasi82: That's pretty awesome. I wish I had natural artist talent. But atlas...
^
moin everypony ^^
^^^
Morning, Invi! :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUoH5kUIVfg - this was my favorite Cinemark Policy video
Although if I actually put some work into it I might get better
Cypresswolf, wat?
IKR! The last policy video was in 1997
:(
Sometimes skill comes more naturally to come, but many others need to practice it'll probably take longer but you'll still improve
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTn00lSAKg0 - this on aired through 98
On the hub right now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L142_juksw8
wait, is that a real cinema intermission?
Oh and yeah, having the DirectV display at work on the Hub is awesome
For the most part
what is a directV display?
/me is now AFL
*AFK
^
Invi We just have a tv set up with a directv reciever, to show customers.
Cypresswolf: Thank you for sharing.
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH, oh awesome :D
I just leave it on the HUB XD The "family friendly" chanell
They were Theatre policy videos for Cinemark 1988-1997
Kinixys: Your Welcome
The funny thing about those videos is that they are still sort of around
I remember seeing that cat in a 3d render before
NOW IZ EPIC COOKING TIME!
/me is back
Hi everyone
I'm backy
hi The_Engineer ^^
wb engie.
Welcome backy The_Engineer
Oh awesome it's Engi! and i just referanced heavy.
:/
I dun care what anyone says. I like Gilda.
Cypresswolf: Hmm... never seen one before. We don't have these
inb4 some one kills me. XD
I wish I could remember the price of a movie ticket when I was a kid - having never bought one myself until Jr High when I was allowed to go to the movies without adult supervision
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: What do you like about Gilda?
what other old stuff can I dig up...
She throws an interesting dynamic that needed to be in MLP FiM. not everyone is a nice friendshipful being in equestria
i remember when movie tickets cost $4.00
I remember some animations - I think Nickelodeon used to play in the late 80's to early 90's
Anyone wanna watch me stream anythin?
One of which was of a man in a yellow shirt sitting down to a breakfast of an egg on a stand, when he's about to crack the shell, he gets a knock at the door...
She shows a bit of why RD likes her so much too, when she is not being a dick to ponies. Granted that only last like 5 minutes.
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I see, for contrast. So you like Gilda cause she makes the friendships that do exist more meaningful?
Gilda was awesome
The man in yellow goes to answer it, but only sees a heavy snow outside, frusterated he goes back to his egg, he gets another knocking sound - this time some ceiling dust falls down
Cypresswolf: Oh I've seen that one.
the knocking continues, each time his house crushes inward, until he is crushed - the camera zoomed out to reaveal
A man in yellow, sitting at the table with a crushed egg on a stand
I've been looking for that cartoon for years, but without the name of it or animator, I havent found it
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I agree. It's nice to know that not everyone in the MLP:FIM universe isn't friendly and kind.
Adds more flavor and depth into the world itself.
Hey
AJIsAwesome:
Yes?
Do you want towatch me stream :)?
the entire Gilda episode was all about trolling
Why do you ask?
Idk I just want somkeone to watch me ;c
Well, I'm not sure. I have homework to do.
FOREVER ALONE. Ghost is with his family and I'm in my house with no one :c
Heya everpony :3
/me sniffs
woops
hi Sonny ^^
xD
Hi, Sonny! :)
hi Sonny
:D
:O It's all coming back to me now - they were called Short Nick Cartoons!
I was just wondering if any of you have a request I can make (for fanart of mlp)
since I finished my last drawing
:p
I want a my OC :3
:D
Sonny can you draw my oc :o
MY GOD I FOUND IT! ^_^ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-XTeyV8Dk&feature=related
How about a Discord drawing?
The_Engineer: I would love too! :)
Yay
:3
T.T
send me a link
I dont have one :c
hello!
You can make one.
Cypresswolf: Well done on finding this relic. :D
;>
I dont want to :c
then how do I know what he/she looks like :p The_Engineer
I can tell you how :3
alright, I could do that
wait I know
There's a pony creater I saw earlyer, you can use that to give me an idea of he/she should look like ^^
I can't tell you how long I've searched for that cartoon :D
Hmm
Its a he
and Its a Engineer...
Cypresswolf, i know that feeling exactly ^^
hi Dken2021 ^^
here it is
AJIsAwesome, Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH. Indeed. Characters such as Gilda establish that in the magical world of Equestria, friendship isn't just automatic; the characters choose to be good.
I know it
Kinixys: Agreed.
Cypresswolf: What the... This was... interesting...
oh, make it in that game thingy and then send me a link
ahi Invi
unless you just want me to make The_Engineer the engineer like your name :p
ya
like me :3
me in p3ny style
Cypresswolf, O.O dat cartoon
I had another such cartoon memory of a caracter that was a bagpipe like creature that could fly when full of air - found out about 2 years ago it was on that show that had Captian OG Readmore
hopefully my connection can hold up
Invi: I watched Follow the Sun; followed by that cartoon. Interesting morning I have having. xD
So the character from team fortress 2 right?
Zuxxez123, follow the sun?
everypony i have to go
still no stream eh?
Invi: You know, For Kids! :)
seeya Maid_RainBow1
Bye, Maid_RainBow1! :)

Invi: I'll PM you the link.

Okay.

hold on The_Engineer :D
so what's his name going to be :)? The_Engineer
Its name is TCR Engineer
1-2 whole months and then only 13 episodes until MLP goes away
Anyone ever see a cartoon - perhaps about 30 minutes - about a family of 4 who adopts a little white dog. has its black round nose floating - not attached to its muzzle - the children are brats...
and this is his cujtie mark
http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/50512_119524058167057_318271767_n.jpg
no season 4
and hes meant to be happy
:P
ok hold on
thought if I got a tablet more people would commission and I'd be able to save money for $1000 eye surgery in December
give me a while :D can't promise it'll be done today tough :D I might get more commissions ^^
Well, gotta work be back later ^^

who's streaming?
Yme Nikki. Another fandom that's created a lot of artwork.

I'm streaming
i can't see the stream.

yea, pretty sure it's ok when no one's on atm
and haven't gotten commissions in like 2 months...
afternoon Bronystate, how are we today? :)
Good, thank you BladedWings.
I'd say, to stay safe of getting kicked, keep the URL in the PM's. Don't want to anyone to get hurt.
yo BladedWings, quite well
Hi, BladedWings. Pretty good, how about you? :)
not sure if I'll be able to make $1000 to pay for eye surgery
What Zuxxez123 said.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: What are you having done?
AJIsAwesome: not bad, got a little homework to do but should be easy
eye surgery?
there's an abcess in my sinus that is pushing on my eye and they said it needed to be removed
oh.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: sounds horrible...
does it hurt?
I don't know much of the medical jargon etc. about it. It don't hurt, just causes bad vision
if I don't get it fixed I'll probably go blind
Oh, my.
oh my, hope you get the money soom
sorry to hear that SeaponiesofLiverpool
thanks
I really wish I could help, but I can't right now.
Hope everything goes well, SeaponiesofLiverpool :(

Hello sonicandmario85.

05seriously?
Pewdie is quite funny some of the time but yeah his general fanbase is most comprised of twats. Like any fanbase really.
VenHur: What.
...I have no idea what I just saided.
Meanwhile:im not one of those faggots who say toby and nova are copying him i like nova toby and pewdie all
You obviously don't brain today.
Guys i'm bored
So what.
05sonicandmario85: dont avoid my question

Geez, I'm kinda sick of hearing tobynovapewdiepie all the time.
Let'splaying is overrated.

Malavolent That and people are stupid enough to bring it up again and agian
Hey, Chuggaaconroy's a great lper.

Nova's also quite funny. Can't say I've ever heard of Toby though.
05then dont say you do liek that and come off like a huge twat
05pro life tip
...
Lol :D
At least HE didn't get to die more than once or twice in his let plays.
guys, ASoftFluffyThing says she went to class but she gives you all hugs <3
Who are you guys talking about?
Wrek Yep you can be honest and blunt saying what you think of said person and what they do. But it's by no means mean't to be anyone elses opionion etc
Don't know anymore.
...Let's Players?
obviosly
Obviously.
I don't really know many let's players, but I like Cr1t1kal, since he doesn't take it too seriously.
i like pewdies happy wheels videos because their funny as hell
they're.
I DONT CARE IF I SPELLED IT WRONG
Dat helpful Meanwhile
O_o
Touche.
Maybe you should, you'd look less like a spazz.
hay guyses
Only Let's Play-ers I know are RoosterTeeth and Yogscast.
Hello Rustymeat.
hey Rustymeat
Haio Rustymeat
Meh. The only LPer I like is NCS because he's laid back. He also shares his life stories with his viewers.
hey
Meanwhile:Maybe i wont do it because i dont want too
good evening
to.
He doesn't take LPing seriously either.
ITS A GUMGOOSE
Hahaha
Haio Applejack2012
Hi, Rustymeat. :)
Afternoon guys
look a moose
And haio Chrysalis :)
Hi, Chrysalis :)
hi Chrysalis
I like Slowbeef and Chipcheezum :D
the reason why im acting like an asshole is because im still mad at wrek for kicking me i wasnt rping at all -__
G'day Rustymeat and Chrysalis
Hello Chrysalis!
if in doubt
hi
the mod is always right
even when they are wrong
^
good evening
Amen
Hey Alchemist
Haio Alchemist
hey Alchemist
The mods word is law
Some LP'ers I liked are Chuggaaconroy, NCS, and a few others...
all i said was HELLO IM PINKIE PIE AND IM GONNA MURDER YOU
good evening
and then i get kicked
yup, that be rp
that is kick worthy imo
:o
Because murdering isn't cool?
sonicandmario85: jee, i wonder why you got kicked :|
Chrysails:how is that rp? i was just joking -_-
cupcakes, cupcakes
AJIsAwesome: only if it's in that Manhunt game.
Ive been kicked for RP when i '/me' patted someone on the back :D
cupcakes, rp, all caps
No biggie
take your pick as to why you got kicked
Very true
Roleplay, srs bsns.
I've never believed in "x is right because they're the one with the big hat"
We don't want roleplays here and deffinetly no Cupcakes!
Yeah, you obviously have to go with the guy with the More Expensive hat! :$
Meanwhile: regardless thats how it is in most cases :D
even when they are wrong though
they do have the big hat
You are wrong, I will tell you you're wrong, I will tell you why you're wrong, and at the end of the day I will take pride in the fact that I had the stones to tell you so.
^ What.
im close to leaving bronystate forever
and then you lose your job/house/account
What's going on this time?
lets plan a coup d'état
sonicandmario85: :(
Be a wuss if you must Chrysalis but don't infect me with it.
sonicandmario85 Then learn to behave
AJIsAwesome: I dont even know :D
besides i was only fucking joking
VenHur: Basically, he doesn't care who is wrong, he is going to kick everyone's flank. Or something like that.
Dat mouth
im sorry whos the one with a degree, a decent job and a house?
how was i suposed to know that was rp?
sonicandmario85 Rules perhaps?
What the hell did I wake up to?
Panda: IKR? :S
Panda: i just as lost as you are :D
someone complaining about leaving b state and Chrysalis and Meanwhile fighting?
as soon as i joined i said HELLO IM PINKIE PIE AND IM GOING TO MURDER YOU
sonicandmario85 dude, you got only kicked, big deal. it's a warning that you shouldn't do what you have done
Panda Yep i would have the same reaction
Malavolent: I know that, it's just that i'm not as serious sometimes like the rest of you guys, i'm just a silly laid back brony.
sonicandmario85: it was just a kick, no biggie
Chrysalis: Well, since I'm living in financial decline, can afford about a meal a day, and can't find work. Probably you.
VenHur: Well in that case carry on :D
/me sighs
You were kicked. I was kicked Plenty of times when i first came here. You learn more after each kick :D
O_o
friends Rainbow Dash plushie for sale! With patterns! http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120991152587
sonicandmario85, just learn the rules. bottom line. Its not that hard to follow.
i did read the rules
Of course, most of the kicks were for a laugh.
it didnt say anything about joking
):<
besides kicks are nothing....
Wrek and his "Kicked for having low dps".... that was great :D
DO WANT! ...but i don't have a lots of bits...
sonicandmario85 Oh right and how is a mod supposed to know through the internet?
if you get banned on the other hand, then you have reason to complain.
Chrysalis: yeah, don't feel like saying much now do you.
Panda Not really if he sets himself up for it over and over again
sonicandmario85: just calm down, so you got kicked...get over it a learn from the mistake...thats life
whatever lets end this stupid conversation
yes, lets :)
Have there been no active streams this entire morning?

Sumica: Just smile and nod.
I'll get round to checking stream when I'm done with TF2, but if it's Sumica then it's likely to be less dull than the more recent ones.

F*** YEAH!

whats this!? O_O
BUTTERFLY IS BEST INTRO!
DIgimon eh?
well, i'm out x.x
Time for Mon of the Digi variety.
Digimon! \o/
Ponyloverforever: something good
^
*theme
What episode are we up to now?
Dken2021: BY FAR.
the german versions of these are surprisingly good
So much better than the english dub intro!
I prob missed a bunch
is this pokemon???
ekips, and the story gets surprisingly good ^^
VenHur: THERE IS NO COMPARISON
this isnt the pokemon theme
VenHur: everything usually is i mean, 4kids doesnt know how to make intros...
never watched it completely though
Ponyloverforever, Digimon
OOOOOOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYYYYY LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
VenHur, I ALWAYS prefer the original opening to the dub
digimon?? did somone did a show mixed with pokemon?
Oh yes, the strange giant cactus with boxing gloves.
Ponyloverforever: no
pocket monsters =/= digital monsters
Ponyloverforever, no, this is the original japanese digimon ^^
Oh, this episode...
Ponyloverforever: nope.
Well, it looks like I missed some of it. So regretably, I'm out of continuity with this.
oh...
dident this show get sued?
Obiviously Ikakumon's debut.
no
so pokemon copyed this show then?
Meanwhile: Ok guys we need a character design for the plant monster.....hmmm.......a cactus kinda hurts......yeah yeah....lets give it boxing gloves.
has Detective Conan been streamed yet?
I think pokemon came first
Mega_Milk: In the event you need to make something look slightly more intimidating, add boxing gloves.
Ponyloverforever: dont know. i think the pokemon thing is older. but digimon always had the better show. witha ctual story
also, these can talk
00,10Oh dear, I am hearing rumors of a springer ep with bronys.
00,10this wont end well
i think nothing will cut down on intimidation if you have spines
:(
ok seems legit
Sumica: springer?
waht
no
05its already aired
Especially if you can't spell bronies.
Sumica: Springer?
dont tell me we-shit
05and lets jsut say its quite the mockery
00,10aye
Why though, why?
oh, that thing
Dken2021: And Digimon came in later, in the format of Tamagotchi, that became a success
Wrek: how bad are we talking?
Dken2021: according to my sources
stern bad?
00,10the egg ep it seems
An onsen? I missed what the translation was at the top.
i thought we were told by strong to not go any where near that asshole
I would
You think everyone'd listen?
Chrysalis: Maybe he didn't listen
It's live and let live

Eggs. Well, if you find a fridge full of eggs near a hot spring, they're probably totally legit.
05how does a girl wearing an unicorn horn and someone in a pinkie pie costume pretendign to be pinkie pie sound Sylandest?
a fridge in the middle of nowhere? let's take something out of it!
i feel bad for the eggs T_T

Wrek: very payed, indeed
imagine if they were fertilized? what a nasty surprise. welcome to my world x.x

Eggceptional isn't it Sumica.

O-kay, i'm kidding...
Back. What did I miss?
hey Litwick, what now?
cybercrime?
why is he angry/
Sumica : what episode is this?
what's going on?
Sumica look in your cookbook under eggception
or sad
Cybercrime Prevention Act. AKA Sopa Mark 2.
:O Litwick!
:) scrambled eggs with salsa, cherry tomatoes with salt & Biscuits with gravy! That'll last you all day :)
and bacon ^^
00,10mayo is just eggs oil and a bit of mustard and onion powder
om nom nom
YES! BACON!
Sumica: EGG-CEPTION
Litwick: they're still on it?!
Cypresswolf: I've never tryed scrambled eggs with salsa. :O Thanks for the idea. :)
Im being completely serious right now. It affects ALL of the Phillipines.
^
Invimon I think I have a new name idea, "Tohuwabohu" ... now that I have written it it sounds way less appealing :/
AND EVEN OTHER PARTS IOF THE WOIRLD
00,10omlet de fromage
You could face 12 years in prison for voicing against it.
they eat digimon eggs?
Sumica: DEXTER's Laboratory reference FTW
Sumice=Dexter
Litwick oh dear, think the petitions will work this time?
Lil_B, indeedy, but it sounds better that that ealier one ^^
It needs a total of 1 million supporters.
Invimon Null Ouver? XD
And even worse: IT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED.
Litwick: Have any proof?
IT NEEDS AT LEAST 1 MILLION SUPPORTERS AGAINST THIS LAW.
already? then I guess it's too late for the petition then
all this food talk made me realize I havent eaten lunch yet...I'm getting some enchiladas down the road :)
is the kid with the green t shirt and blone hair a boy or girl?
Lil_B, you have to find something smashing :D too long words are hard to recognize ^^
Hold on Ill find the link, if the mods will allow it.
Ponyloverforever a boy

So is that thing like a seal? Or some kinda deformed otter? -lol
Never mind, I just typed in the wrong link XD
hey CountDoofus :)

Ponyloverforever: pegasus, with a unicorn helmet

And it just sat there and did nothing? :S
Not the pony ;^;
/me really loves Shizuka all of a sudden

13why

and that answers your question of the previous scene's neccessity
pegasus range
http://www.change.org/petitions/junk-the-cybercrime-prevention-law Now, if we get 1 million supporters on this thing, we'll have a hefty burden off our backs. But ONLY if we get that many supporters on this thing.
thanks Litwick
00,10suddnly morning
Sure, just sit there and stare at the black thing coming at you :|
AJIsAwesome: no, they just raaaaaaaaaaan, they ran so far awaaaaaaaaaay

Shizuka: thats beautiful!

Why's he called Greymon? Like no part of him is grey.
WARGREYMON!!
Shizuka: you both look great :3
Metal Greymon!

So is this unicorn thing evil or just pissed?

Mozdoc: just pissed off
Mozdoc: Possessed.
Kencolt: That's not grey.
00,10the green maned one is mine Chrysalis.
my mane is almost white
possessed
its been far too long since i looked at peoples ocs
Sora!
Mozdoc it's been hit with a dark gear, which makes it evil
What I missed?
ahh ok
so sumica is new favourite streamer
but Shizuka is damn cute
Sumica's silly dancing poneh
Stab the sigil- I mean pull the gear!
00,10indeed she is
IT'S A FLYING HORSE, HOW HARD CAN IT BE
Besides, in anime, and games-- this being from both-- since when does any name have to make sense?
DAT BIG BROTHER
Jyou you sure are a stupid bugger.
oh god
cue BATTLE THEME
DED
Wow so thats what kinda show this is
i prefer the english songs for these
A dragon ball z kind.
Mega_Milk: Pretty much. :D
Chrysalis: Agreed.
Noooo, let the kid die!
and while you were digivolveing he went splat
I prefer the japanese BGM
00,10english?
Were yelling triggers EVERYTHING
with the power of love!
MadSurge it's a Level obove the other Digimon, that black wheel is rerally embedded in this backsite :/
dat filler
they use the opening tune for digivolution
much better
:D
xD
Suddenly DEJA VU
hello taoumi
wait, wat
suddenly englishj
NYAAAAAHHHH
Suddenly english -lol
dual-language?
wait what english?
WITH ENGLISH DUB!!?????
Oh lol Sumi :D
00,10dual audio
hallo. i finished the alicorn patern
did I just learn Japanese?
Sumica: you so random
SO MUCH DUBBING FAILURE
TARDIS translation circuits engaged.
taoumi: awesome
see, that musics MUCH better
Lil_B: I mean, shooting at a flying horse, it's a pretty big target
they have english dub?
also, ikakumon sounds badass
why did the laguage swap? I dislike that digivolving theme :<
Chrysalis: <.< No
it must be my tardis cookie jar that let's me translate this I guess...
not really
Better voice at any rate.
The dub may be far from exact, but it has much the same sense.
suddenly... english background score :| ... it's not bad, but the original is better balanced
I love how his voice sounds like a woman immitating a man -lol
Translating these names? SURELY YOU JEST
00,10enough of that =p
and back :D
suddenly japanese again
aw :<
Chrysalis: i don't mean to be a jerk, but i grew up with the original BGM, though the english one isn't that bad
and back to singinh BG
Sumica: Thank you, that dub hurts my ears.
/me is pleased by this
^
grew up with the german dub, which came directly from the japanes original. so i do prefer the japanese over the english
yeah
i grew up on the english dub
sounds way better
for like, 6 years
on cartoon network
Sumica: It's like watching the English version of Tengen. XD
00,10I watched english so this is a nice change
grew up with Germand Danish dub
and
I've only watch up to the second adventure
they dont make animes like this anymore
Dken2021: same here
I only watched the first episodes
I dunno. The aesthetic of Digimon still doesn't appeal to me.
Sumica: Seen That dude in Suede's latest Pokemon Review? :D
Digimon season 1 and 02 where the best
voices seem a bit better in the japanese overall. but the score seems much better in the english
I'm with Dark_Horst thgey< really did a great job woith the german dub back then
So the seal is the bad ass of the group? Of course. Not the T rex. Nope. The seal.
taichi tachi
Oh this theme..........
OH NO, A SEA
00,10sorry no english opening though
Lil_B: definately
00,10both tracks use butterfly
Lil_B, I like how they named Takeru just TK ^^
Sumica good, rather not hear that
I imagine wearing sunglasses while listening to this............<3
awwww
to youtube
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Hello everyone
and sith realises what hes just missed
'Lo T.
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
ohai TGAPT
hi
hi everypony who joined ^^
Ipersonally always likes S3-- Tamers-- the best. It was kind of quirkier, and in a strange way more eralistic.
hay TGaPT
WTF ok
*realistic.
/me wears sunglasses while listening to this......
Kurra: it's ok
what i can say is that the english dub of this seems a lot better than the one of tamers. there they jsut utterly raped it
Kencolt, that was when i stopped watching it
Lil_B: i liked Myotismon's VA
hai everypony! :$
I LOVE YOU...........
I wish........
Lil_B : i have to agree on that
I didn't watch past adventure 1
Hi, Michael :)
and voice of the new oipening of Castlevania X Chronicles for the PSP XD
FUCKING HELL
YOU'RE NOT TWILIGHT, you can't wish!
Hey Sumica the Springer bit is on youtube. You should stream it.
hi Michael :)
I wish Tenchi Muyo was around still. Back in the day, I looked like him. But that's not WHY I watched the series, heh.
. after that, it went downhilltamers was awesome too
whoops
i jumbled something
/me hugs AJIsAwesome Lil_B
yay
well yeah, tamers was pretty much the last good season
love the opening
english opening
Sumica : Please next digi venture
<3
00,10there
Now enligh dub...
WHA______:D
whoo
Pffffft, a Red Arima digimon?!
?
/me marries Sumica
Digimon Garlic Champions.
and THIS is CRAP
sure, why not
Never unheard that.
/me 's brain has fallen
00,10it's just the openings
that opening isn that bad, but have to admit it kills every epicness in a battle
woah this theme song this isnt calming at all like the chinese version
i cant believe springer would stoop that low
and suddenly I feel bad for all those who had to endure this during their childhood
owait
Gotta admit it's catchy
yes i can
:(
... seriously? that is the english opening? that doesn't even sound like a coherent song :/
ikr
PAINFULLY CATCHY
^
Japanese openings > English openings.
oh g2
Bronysith he's springer, he's hit low ever since he changed his show form something intellectual to white trash tv
That drill dude was pretty spiff though c|
Besides, the first three seasons used the SAME FREAKING song!
VenHur why change a song thats so badass
Dken2021: he hired an actor to play as a brony and made us look like huge fags
Tamers dub has this kind of punkish backbeat to it's opening...
Lil_B: i rather listen to PIG POWER IN THE HOUSE
VenHur really? the 3rd too?
although, screw dna digivolving
Lil_B: Yup.
Lil_B: yep
00,10such a varaity of themes
IKR? :D
Altough the third one used a more punk-ish feel.
XD
Creative bunch aren't they.
we're so creative
Kurra: anything with tattered wings is not strong imo :D
lyrical genius
looking back on these intros, each one is trying to make itself look more historic than the invasion of Normandy.
>.<
oh look, they changed some of the lyrics
make it stop ;_;
that epic intro
00,10and then this travisty
and suddenly
shite
lawl
and this is where it went to poop
although
Digimon OP
Suddently, this opening!
:D
the lyrics are horrifically catchy
but the music :(
OH MAI NEW THEME
... Leb deinen Traum, denn er wird wahr... :'(
Oh, it's that fox monster thing
Like honestly, they're trying to be bigger than the Beatles trying to be bigger than Jesus.
I never EVER listened to this one
:O
sudenly the horible digimon
oh yea, sorta remember this, but it was ony basic tv
Sumica: inb4 Pokemon Theme
05,15My god. This is worse than the Star Trek:Enterprise opening
:D
This one is a sigh of relief from the last three, and the lyrics even better sounding!
this intro is better though :>
this one's kinda fine
Ohai Fluttercry!
...In my opinions though.
oh, this sounds ... not really badf actually, at least better :)
i wanna go back to the first theme
00,10good op but shit show
...I regret that they learned the meaning of creativity.
PFFF Star Trek Enterprise was the most chill opening |3
hai Fluttercry
00,10and then
i agree with Sumica

PONY YOUR BATTLESTATIONS!

PEOPLE*
Game maker + steam workshop + chevos, brilliant ?

This is our representative???? We couldnt find anyone else??
Maid_RainBow: Yes.

THIS is an actor.
'outrgeous guilty pleasures.' Oh yeah. I can see where THIS is going. -.-

/me search a spot to hide
00,10these have to be actors
^

SEEMS LEGIT

Sumica: YOU DONT SAY

^^^^^^
Seems legit.
Actors or extremists.
05,15yeah...actually seeing her. She's totally not legit
Geez this just seems sleezy...
00,10especaly this one
We were afraid you'd do this.
SO HOW ABOUT TAKING A PERSON WHO IS NOT CRAZY, Springer?
i can't believe im gonna say this
And then you did.
Sexy
05,15LOL

And he gets the freaks. Of course he gets the freaks.
They must be actors.

Normal bronies would not do this.

Kencolt theyre actors
She wears a dress.
OH LOOK, A PERSON WHO is PERFECT for the common brony
Spaghetti!!
00,10dash with a horn yeah
AH!
DashWithRainbows: Agreed.
RAINBOW DASH AND SHES WEARING A HORN!
wut
he is me
05,15DashWithRainbows there were some people at Bronycon like that.
THIS, is an actor, not that bullcrappy Adam Sandler!
Alicorn Dash.
00,10they did shit for reaserch
Dude...
wait.. she's RD? with a horn.. what...
They can not even spaghetti right
:D
Springer...
NewSuperBronyU: why dident you sleep
Fluttercry at least they got the characters right
Oh wow. That caused me physical pain.
00,10I expect we will see more of this to come later
05,15That wasn't nearly as much fun as I thought it'd be :(
00,10it's gauker, to be expected
Rainbow Dash with a horn?
WAT?
these people exist out there. you know it. what is your fucking problem with them?
Spaghetti rating out of 10, guys?
what the fuck was that?
Vordox, indeed xD
idk
DashWithRainbows: Meh. 2.
Rainbow Dash...with the horn of a unicorn?
DashWithRainbows: I've seen worse.
srsl, no words
05,150/10 would not buy from again
It was a 2 at tops.
HAHAHA this was like Italian tv
*srsly
and to think, his show started as a political talk show
Don't know if it 20% Cooler, or just plain wrong.
Holla everypony! :)
Nice try Springer. Have som real spaghetti.
hola GilDash
howdy GilDash :)
hai GilDashy ^^
But since you could tell they were bad actors, -18546/10
hai GilDash
Would want to throw in the garbage.
Dken2021: much like many stupid italian shows state to be :D
that was ridicolous xD
I've seen worse spaghetti videos than this. This doesn't even faze me.
Hello GilDash! :)
The funny thing is if actual people had been on there it probably would have made the fandom look worse.
ALso, hi GilDash :)
DashWithRainbows: You know that the mouth breathers in the audience bought it.
AJIsAwesome: spaghetti videos?
05,15Meanwhile lol true
hi GilDash
How so?
Meanwhile: Agreed.
hi
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH Obviously.
hy GilDash :)
00,10now some good openings
Suddenly Riff
YES! BUTTERFLY!
Dat guitar riff
I hate fandoms like Sonic's, but the Bronies are suprisingly not annoying.
well, nothing to get upset about really, even if they were actors or not, I see no reason to be mad about it
this song is childhood!
05,15VenHur....suuuuuure
And thus why I loved you guys.
/me hugs VenHur
/me hugs VenHur :)
Fluttercry: Are we "annoying" Fluttercry?
/me cuddles VenHur :D
VenHur hey, there's some good sonic fans out there
05,15Not you guys
<.< This isn't the Digimon theme?
again, the german versions of these songs are surprisingly well made
/me hugs everypony
yeah Vordox
/me <.< goes to shower then make ponies
/me hugs VenHur
that 360p
05,15Just the more...unsavory elements
Fluttercry: Or more honestly "Some of you guys..."
VenHur You obviously don't browse Tumblr enough.
Trust me.
btw cactusmon is best cactus
Fluttercry: I know what you're talking about
there actually quite a lot annoying things about a lot of Bronys Behaviours, but not here on Broynystate, that's why I'm here :)
But the intro is the G1 or G2...
Tonnes of drama and attention whores.
This song is NEITHER
Some of the MLP Tumblrs are.........INTERESTING.
I tracked doewn both Digimon Soundtrack CDs fot the Songs >.<
Mega_Milk: Non-actors would have been so much more awkward and faily.
cya
AJIsAwesome: Princess Molestia is my favourite
05,15There is a reason my Brony related activities are limited to Bronystate
Lil_B, that Piano cover was sooo awesome ^^
00,10this op i did't like so much
AJIsAwesome: I only saw one :D
Vordox: Meh. Not a fan of Molestia, IMO.
Fluttercry: So if someone pushed you to a big meetup?
Fluttercry come to the next BUCK
Invimon It truly is :;) I even have the german Digimon HGold Soundtrack Sealed XD
branch out to awesome
05,15Vordox I went to Bronycon. It was fun.
I agree with what Chrysalis says
I WON'T GO THERE though
Sumica, can you look upt the seasn 1 piano cover? it's worth it ^^
00,10I like ponys, not bronys
05,15^
Vordox why
Sumica: WHAT? WHAT?! WHAAAT?!
05,15Most of my joy comes from the show and chatting with you guys
pretty much
^^
hes supprising normal
Fluttercry I can understand that a lot.
Sumica: but you like fans like us, don't you?
for a scottish guy
Hey guys, what ar- um are we watching digimon?
Hi, Obsidian :)
And I don't like hugs
:D
I like being able to spell ponies.
Obsidian we were earlier, and hai there
00,10yeah but i dont see you all acting as nutters either =p
/me not-huggs Vordox
Thanks. :P
Sumica: THe power of Bronystate :P
hai Obsidian
00,10liked this opening
/me wonders what the feck that even means.
You know, I'll confess something. Before, I wasn't ever interested in this whole Digimon thing, but after seeing this I'll admit, there's some cool creatures there.
Vordox: Nutters?
Fluttercry: I like chatting too ^^ but meeting up with people at BUCK was fun :)
AJIsAwesome: Mostly.
OH I remember this song!
running to the left, as always
Mozdoc, it even has a Cuthulu Digimon :D
just whatever you do
MadSurge: It helps clear confusion too, eh? ;)
DONT go to the bronystate event at buck
05,15MadSurge that's why I enjoyed Bronycon, I got to hang out with some Bronystate people
unless you like being embarrassed
Vordox: It's basically the people who obsess over the show. I mean 100 percent obsess over it.
Chrysalis: Why? O.o
Chrysalis why?
AJIsAwesome: You mean people who want attention?
do you not recall me and gildash being put on a panel
with nothing to say
GilDash: your gender for example ;)
Biggest Dreamer :) a really good song too :)
Chrysalis: Why did you go up to the panel then? :P
Chrysalis You were put on a panel?
MadSurge: Exactly. XD
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME MORE
NAO
you do what mods say
Chrysalis that happened?
Chrysalis: Why not just shake your head?
Yeah, that pannel was really fun. >_>
Chrysalis: TAKE A STAND FOR WHO YOU ARE
Lil_B, who was the bad guy in season 3 again?
well, all my friends somehow saw it
Vordox: No, not like that. It's kind of like people who think that the show is real or people who are obsessed enough to change their names to the characters on the show.
so that was fun
05,15Yup
hi-
AJIsAwesome: I wouldn't mind a land of Brony only
hai CCCP
and with this one i stoped watching digimon
Hello CCCP
00,10F was odd cause they did't have digimon partners
Chrysalis I would eather act like a statue, because I can't handle the situation, or act like a totall Jackass XD
DashWithRainbows yeah, me and gildash got put on the panel while Wrek drew prarity
hi Michael and Obsidian!
/me hugs CCCP
Sumica: Yeah-- in Frontier thyey WERE the Digimon...
It was super fun. >_>
Digimon series lost me here
F was where they were avatars to digimon right?
Lil_B: I'm not caring if anyone sees me
Totally not awkward at all. <_<
DashWithRainbows http://i.imgur.com/sCaqn.jpg
/me huggles Lil_B ^-^
Sumica, they had rabbit that was able to kill other digimon with farts in the game
hai CCCP
If I would go up or not depends on the situation. :P But I would decide the outcome of either choice.
hello Dken2021!
Chrysalis Is dat you wit da pink hare?
Chrysalis: Why do you have that?! Get rid of it! XD
GilDash i have more :P
lies.
Vordox: Meh. I don't think we would need one. True, we aren't like many other fandoms, but we seriously don't need an island for us.
Vordox I kinda do :/ not much because I know it doesn't mean much, but still, I really hate talking in front of lots of people
hello people of bronystate
He isn't holding an iron brew.
DashWithRainbows im the one with long hair
DashWithRainbows: Truth! I shared a room with him!
Hi, Tailsy :)
hello DashWithRainbows!
Chrysalis what did you talk about on that panel?
hello people of Tailsy
00,10shall we go back to the show now?
DashWithRainbows: Yes it is. ^_^
Sumica: Frontier was a different concept, instead of having Digimon partners, they have digivice to BECOME the digimons, which I find interesting...
hi AJIsAwesome and Tailsy
Howdy CCCP.
Sure.
hai Tailsy ^^
Lil_B: so do I. BUt if I would go up there, I would be akward but I wouldn't be weird. :P
also
GilDash Liieeeeessssss
hai DashWithRainbows and Tailsy
DashWithRainbows: Nope. :p
Sumica: How about "no"? :P
What was it Izzy said about the timeline difference between the Digi-World & Earth? 10 miinutes = 1 day?
THIS IS GILDASH IN THE MIDDLE http://i.imgur.com/QQdya.jpg
:P
This one was tthe breaking point for me
Chrysalis: You bastard. XD
Vordox yeah :/ I guess I would have to be there to know how I really act XD
it's been ages since i came here
Chrysalis: Ponytail.
its on facebook you know
10 earth minutes = 1 Digi Day?
*?
GilDash: Wow you look REALLY silent there. :D
Sumica: Tamers also used that concept for the Bio-Digivolution...
Chrysalis: That's okay, I'm not really affiliated with FaceBook.
you'll never find pictures of me in the internet Chrysalis :P
AJIsAwesome yes, i have a ponytail
Vordox: Actually, I was one of the most vocal ones there. XD
Chrysalis: Okay.
I have only seen onen pciture of Chrysalis on the panel, not seen the Video :/
GilDash: I really like your.....mane?
and soon a pony
digimaaaaaaan
No wait. It's called Biomerging, sorry...
oh they had a second intro?
DAT 240p Quality
Lil_B theres a video?
Never knew there was a 7th
Mega_Milk: What little of it I have. XD I'm not really a long hair person.
240p is best p
Chrysalis I don't know, the way people just talked about it sounded like there is a video :/ maybe I misread something
05,15you spoiled kids and your HD, when I was a kid, we only had 240p and we liked it!
when i was a kid
GilDash: I thought you were the guy with the pony tail. Or are you the guy with the purple arm band?
Fluttercry VHS all the Way!
They got the second opening after they recieved the Digivice BURSTs.
high defition was 360p
05,15YEAH
I actually did have 240 as a kid.
Fluttercry and sometimes videos played in 60fps
Fluttercry: Um... No. We hated it. But it's what we were used to.
I LOVE VHS.
>_< And we were Thankful!
^
FlutterCry : i agree

05,15I remember, when my dad bought our first DVD player we were SHOCKED
Meanwhile Trees doen't exist

When I was a wee little lad, We only have the Nintendo 64 and VHSs.
CCCP: No.

Fluttercry: i had lion king on vhs. then, a year ago i saw the HD version of it. i was like "holy fuck, that green haze i remmeber is ACTUAL GRASS??"
Damnit T why.

11,02Hai :3/

Mega_Milk: That was pretty much the entire event. I was *not* prepared for being called up *at all*. XD
Mega_Milk: The entire thing was basically pulled off last minute as well. :S

IDIOT.
nani? more like nani nanu?! (nobody will get it)
My mom was filling me with work, work, work
i mean Dark92Enigma , digimon :3
Obsidian: Ah.
Sometimes, the player would eat the tape, so you had to use a pencil to rewind the tape back inside
welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
or really bored
Invimon: i know, i was on this stream a few moments ago
I remember VHS, I always made forts out of them
05,15When does Blue Eyes White Dragon show up and summon Exodia?

Cypresswolf: I used to get in trouble for pulling out the tape in the recorder.....:$
Killing the children. FOR JUSTICE.
degimoan
Dark92Enigma, you asked what you missed ^^
Wow -lol Those digimon are ALWAYS wrong.
00,10MadSurge, they thought they had hope of finding a way home
Fluttercry that actually hurt
Fluttercry when they gather the 7 dragonballs
MadSurge: Obligatory Childhood Angst.
Fluttercry thats Pokemon silly
00,10they then found out they were traped on an island
Invimon: yes......and i missed the episode title
AJIsAwesome: I used to pull the tape out of vhs tapes just to hang the tape out the window in the back of the bus

05,15So, let me get this straight, they have to take the Digimon to Viridian City to battle Seto Kaiba for the map to One Piece, and use that to enter the Soul Society...that about right?
Not dropping fish?
Mega_Milk: Ikr, I want some villains to actually attack during dress up sequences
08,01ekips: psht, i like girls!
Fluttercry: And then one of them will become Hokage.
Fluttercry: Seems legit
Fluttercry: Pretty much.

Fluttercry: Um. No. Not even close.
Fluttercry: sums it up quite well
08,01androgynous.

05,15Right, and winning the Cell Games means that you can control Gunmen
08,01GilDash: no idea, i didn't want to see the corpse

Dken2021 we food want!
05i keep thinking I am talking
Sumica, it's the digiworld, they found a refrigionator next to hot water filled with eggs...
Wrek: quick question, how did you beat doom without strafing?
Free Food! - Why is it on the tab- Who cares!
Dken2021: they have the personality of sandpaper, rock, match, cardboard, plastic, and cement. COME ON, even cement is interesting to watch
05,159,3 Is this less confusing Wrek? lol
Wasn't this scene banned in the US version?
Just 3 dudes taking a bath together.
My eyes!
05Bronysith: by turning using the turn keys on A and D isntead of strafe on A and D
00,10loose the green highlight
dat green on green action
05Fluttercry: better yes
RAPE alert
Dken2021: that* was a modified quote by NC and not by me

Dark92Enigma ah

YOU'RE ALL UNIDENTIFIED GENDER MONSTERS, WHO CARES WHERE YOU BATH
how do they know how the island is called?
inb4 Man up time
Dark_Horst: Remember, Tamers has all of S1 and 2 as TV shows and card games-- not really a part of Tamers.
Dark_Horst: But that's a different season; different rules.
00,103,15 better?
AJIsAwesome: man up time?
Fine by me.
Kinixys: probably
05,15I can't leave my colors Wrek I've had them for months!
guess what? it;s a trap
Dat xbox sumica
MadSurge obviously by saying he belong to the other side he is identified as male so your logic is flawed

Thank you for finally playing that, because I've seen a bit of it on a commercial for Intel chips or something and always wondered about it.

Alright. I guess this is my out.

I guess you could say... the butler did it
Now I know, its Gentlemens Dual.

05,15Jack Black on Seasame Street was awesome
OCTAGON!
05,15So was Ricky Gervais
yay ytp
00,10Shizuka would probably like this
The irony would be undieing if some one where to whine about this being streamed, when Mister Crabs is playing the smallest violen.
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: :D
That's...not irony.
How so?
Yesh Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH that's ain Irony
Explain!
05,15Meanwhile nobody knows what irony is
If only Shizuka was here...
Ironing?
^
13like what
...Oh...
Seriously how is that not ironic.
Irony is when something happens that's the opposite of what you expect to happen.
Um...he-he...
00,10spongebob dose still alive
Sumica: So MUCH grammatical errors here...
yay
With a special cameo from Jack Black...
Sumica: So much we can learn :P
05,15Like, driving to the vet, and hitting a cat is irony
ORIGINAL BAD APPLE!
ooooh
Bad apple
05,15in fact, just look up Bo Burnham's song about Irony,
fluttercry: That would suck :D
holy shit
English one or normal ?
Holy hell...
So much Paper died that day
all those frames
I have no idea what this is.

k normal
must have taken hours
Sumica: Sad. :(
00,10also i have not watched it yet =p
Meanwhile: Bad Apple, another Touhou remix :D
weeping_pegasi82: 3 months
weeping_pegasi82: hours? try days
Sumica: It's worth it, trust me =P
OKAY THIS IS AWESOME
I would die from boredom
Name of the video?
05,15Okay, how is Touhou so popular? It looks like just another bullet hell game
MadSurge: Based on Elly's theme from.. Touhou 3, I think
MadSurge: I don't know what Touhou actually is either. I've only ever seen remix music vids of it.
<--- You see here there with the Scytche soon at the end of the video
oddly enough i like the enlgish version of this one
00,10fluttercry, fandom
fluttercry: WHY!?
fluttercry: WHYYYYYYYYYYY!?
05touhou?
Soooooo I still say it is irony considering the intent of it being streamed, to provide entertainment for us, yet one deciding to instead whine about it. I would say that is not an expected, or in this case an opposite reaction to it.
WELL I OUGHTA explain it all
this is SO BAWSS O_O
Apperantly Vordox is a fan
1 Man, 1 dream, 1 change.
love this song
And then, fandom strikes
What is this video?
CENSORING IS BAD
Its just also funny that whining would fall in line with the "smallest violen"
and then kickbot strikes
You cannot STOP FREEDOM!
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: But that's something you'd expect to happen regardless. It's amusing, but not ironic.
Wombo Tri Combo.
Meanwhile: mainly, a bullet hell game series. But people took all the boss characters and gave them comics and personalities
Apperantly, no one knows the video...
05,15lol dat kick bot
00,10but people bitch about what we stream all the time
awesome vid!
Wait, who got kicked? :S
Someone printed out and photographed five thousand images!?
VenHur: I do, cause I am Ozzyan. The one that uses internet as it's true purpose :P

Wrek: Bullet hell game that has a massive fanbase
Wrek, have you reset the total kick counter?

05,15So I did
:[ DOH DOH DOH
dat ass grab
I wonder how many DDR songs came from atual bands then. o.o
witch doctor, damn i feel old
Also Meanwhile the type of irony I was refering to is dramatic irony which is typically used to convey that the person is oblivious to something, in this case whining and not noticing the worlds smallest violin analogy.
That's not dramatic irony either.
00,10dramatic irony, that's like a fire station burning to the ground
I heard the band members were actually animators.
Dramatic irony is when the audience is aware of something the characters in the media in question aren't.
How is it not? Okay. Fine. You are still wrong.
Anyway, Touhou is a game franchise created by ZUN's former group back in the 1990s, which had a mellow increase of fans due to the Music at most first and the rather strange game formula of the First Touhou, after that he decided to do more of the same game with some changes to a more friendlier Bullet Hell, and this lasted up to the 5th Touhou, from which the fandom has grown over several years, And then he decided to Go Solo fro

00,10this is what gainax made to relax efter EVA
^^^^^
Sumica: Kinda notice...
Yeah, EVA was.........interesting. :D
INb4 BIG CLICK
Did being run over and then hit in the face with a guitar hurt?
no

05,15I would say, here comes the weird part, but....yeah
He is a unicorn,, why is he hiding it!?
After End Of Evangelion they made this to make something fun and weird
so here comes the weird part
cachi01: THIS IS WEIRD?
:D
Well I've gone through HELL alot if this is "Weird" by any means. :D
MARK OF THE T MAN
Vordox: no it's not, the weird comes later
MadSurge: Seen this =P
I call a MarkOfTheDemon/10 on this
(Everything is oridinary) I wanna call BS on that comment. :P
How is any of this "ordinary"? Well, unless you lived there. :D
GilDash: Well not ordinary, but there is a story here :P
And chat is silent
Vordox: It's alright, I'm quite entertained as it is.
Nvm
But I've seen Higurashi for example or Elfen Lied manga, and that's WAY more weird then this at first =P

Okay, how spiked my coffee, this can't be the real anime.
furikuriii!
who*
Fat lump cat.
(But in reality; when was this made)
Weirdest anime I've seen...... DAMNIT there is no weird manga I can think of atm or anime.. >.>
If I didn't know better, I'd say this can't get any weirder
Still not as confusing as that anime about the kids fighting supernatural things with the talking cat.
Sailor Moon?
Yep, nm.
...
05,15Meanwhile Ghost Stories?
*nnvm
wasn't this made in like 2004?
so, what was the name of that show again?
Yeah that one fluttercry.
05,15the one where they changed the dub and made it a comedy
OH.
Aye, that one.
Don't know why but I love that sound of a distant overhead jet.
00,10suddnly
THAT ONE.
Vordox: anything by Junji Ito
Manganime
and then this
:D
suddenly manga
dafuq #4
fluttercry: That's just arsetastic arsehole of a duber who ruined stuff =P
Sudden manga/
MANGA
MadSurge: Nah, Uzumaki and such are not "weird"
05,15Vordox no it was fantastic
I didn't see the "kids" in your comment, so I assumed Sailor Moon.
fluttercry: In WHAT way is that weird though? =P
O_O
Vordox: nope. it was fucking hilarious
CUPCAKES
05,15anytime I hear a phone conversation begin with "So I was banging this midget when..." I immediately call it awesome
Yay FLCL
:D!
Her "Cupcakes"? :S
FOOLYCOOLY!!!
hahahaaaaaaa
/me gives up trying to accept reality and lets the anime flow through me.
FoolyCoolying
I count this as 2 dafuqs, so I'm at 5

MadSurge: still a BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT
You should know about your own head.
Zuxxez123: The character design is very good.
That cat just spreeeeaaads.
Isn't that big lipped alligator thing another thing nostalgia critic forced for a joke?
Kinixys: For being Random lol
MURRICA
05,15I'd be okay with that...
Buytoast: yep
lol-ed
no wonder it isn't funny then
fluttercry: Oh reaaallly....? *Countdown begins*
fluttercry: yeah same here
Lol, that face change.
The awkward nature of the kid in this show reminds me of my little brother. A lot. Its kind of freaking me out.
Hey is your friend's family poor?
I Remember Once I Wrote That On All My Cigarettes :D
what a freakin' question to ask, jeez
Sumica: Would Mahou Shoujo Magica Madoka be "weird"? >.> Considering the story/Plot/Lore <.<
00,10yup
00,10but it still has flow
00,10this is kinda all over the place
True...
His dad is like, slipping in and out of a mushroom high every few seconds.
I don't feel the "over the place" here, myself.
I know how to handle multi plots at once.
00,10well once you know the show it makes more sence
Vordox: Ill Say Its Weird... Considering The Actual Show Is Vastly Different Then The Advertisements It Had Out lmao
Laurayne: True.
hard bread
Sumica, do you know 5cm per seconds? May I request it to be streamed some time? :3
Shizu morrowind overhaul 3 is out :O
Sumica: That's the thing I was not confused during watching this, I could read and precreate the story while watching =P

Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony! :)
05,15THERE IS NO STORY
... I have NO clue about what I just saw.
fluttercry: Isn't that how fandoms work?
It's a giant robot battling a giant tobot hand what is there to get.
fluttercry: There is, and actually simplier then people try to think it is =P
Who a needs a story? I mean really...
00,10whats to understand, a robot came out of his head to do battle with another robot that came out of his head.
yes there is, it's just told as if the Doctor were leading you through it.
Eeeyup Sumica
i love this gif http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mazrxx994e1r8uiq6o1_1280.gif
makes sense to me
Poor scooter
in that it doesnt need to make sense
The factions and else have been validated as well :P
05,15This is why I hate anime. Shit tried to be all deep and artistic, and it just comes off as dumb
fluttercry: No that's just the Miku fan movie =P
this isnt a deep anime at all
I'll... just go... back over there...

Kinixys: Yep. I was waiting for that
Sumica: Anyway, want more anime? :P
cachi01: Oh come on; that's how she looks when she gets out of bed. Don't be so insensitive.
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: HAha
I am surprised no one posted that sooner
:P
ride on shooting star? already done that
there really isnt anything to make sense of, it is just about the main character getting older all the other stuff is just glitter and shiny
Sumi up there jammin to the tunez.
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I'm suprised someone crossed them. The two shows and characters couldn't be any different.
That reminds me of my old car. I loved that thing, and it loved to break down.
Memories.

^^
don't you have bombs then?
MonkeyTroubles Well then all i will say welcome and keep to the rules and have fun :P
what kind of bomberman game is this
MonkeyTroubles: Ah, I see. Bronystate is basically a streaming site. We stream movies on BMN and occasional things like shows and maybe art at the mods leisure. :)
Hello
Hi, Party :)

To be honest...yeah Kirk sounded like that.
kinda*
Laurayne: Aw man. I hope that everything goes well the second time. :(
But it's pretty darn similar.
that is kinda how he talked
13only kirk i know is from generations, which i suppose he was more mellowed out
/me starts making pies and starts eating
Shizuka: Though, people do take it to a new extent from time to time, his pauses aren't horridly long, but this guy is doing a good version.
It's an exagurration of his speaking style.
my heart can't take this
