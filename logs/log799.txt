08,01doesn't de broglie wavelength decrease as mass increases?
school*
Not these jokes...
i think de broglie wave is h/p
.......
08,01frequency increases
it also depends on the speed, as well as mass
08,01so wavelength decreases?
bigger mass, smaller wavelength
08,01aye
old i meant

Well, astronomy.

No. I mean I prefer astronomy.

The only thing that truly amazes me.
hey do i smell?
use the force.
/me sniffs pits
04I doubt it
11,02hmmm...guess you are right, the de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum...and since velocity doesn't change, the mass has to.

you can be just as good on a controller as a KB/M

I really don't like playing online with people. They just sit there and yell at you because they're being an idiot and blaming you.

ahh
It's always the fault of the good players
wow, xbox is WAY behind
xbox fans are loud
:I
like mine
*in terms
let me get a list
boop
a) the world is limited on the xbox
b) only 8 players at a time per world
c)texture packs
barely any room for exploration
e) mods
f)skins
g) loads of items / blocks
push....button....open...door
h) upside down blocks
they need to implement infinite terrain for the xbox
^]
the xbox physically can't handle a bigger world
whats a terrain?
/me facedesks
Wow.
Seriously.
00,10cause he likes warm floors
....
...
/me is having an aneurysm
booooooo!
terrain -> Gameworld
Sheesh, that's a fast cart.
nothing can be endless.
i have mined out larger areas than the xbox can even store
'Nothing can be endless'
LOL
and?
http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1345/70/1345705036366.jpg
it would take several MONTHS of non stop travelling to hit that limit
really?
seen the middle earth map?
looks damn good
also
xbox has to give a tutorial
too
00,10PC has web pages taht are easaly accesd
much work?
00,10they have tutorials
Depends on how you play.
/me twitches
If you prefer survival and doing things legit, then yeah there's a bit of time involved.
theres another difference
But creative mode, if you prefer that, it doesn't take much time to build.
thats not one of the rules.
well xbox is behind in updates :I
if the xbox could support java, there wouldn't be as many update problems
MS wouldnt let it support java though
the xbox really wouldnt like it
hardware wouldnt handle it well
I hate when I can't get through doors...
And then I run at them ten times
is this happenning
awesome
sour?
does the xbox have the end yet?
or hardcore mode
the xbox couldn't handle the end
doubtful the players could handle hardcore
and with limited map sizes, finding a stronghold is nearly impossible
damn pig
interesting fact: minecarts have different physics settings when they are empty, and when they have something in them

i cant even draw a square with straight lines
or a good circle
You can if you use Photo shop
i just tried drawing a 'perfect' square, i failed
Well that's just difficult without a ruler or straight line tools in drawing programs
hmm, getting close now
But I can't really say anything, especially when I have to draw circles for people XD
just takes time and practice
like any skill
Yep
i draw like a kindergardner at age 18 which is quite sad :'(
My mood goes down the tubes when I go to DA

Oh look at twilight now

my gf hates twilight saga and one direction she is 13 i'm 14
!
I just had a realization
lol, morons
Not just to impress
Friggin squealing girls running through stores, looking at 1D...makes us all look bad
People like things because they like it
i mean if they actually like them fine (they have terrible taste but fine)
I'm very sexual, and I am not a slave to sex
And she's awesome
asexuality is a very, very, rare function, extremely few people have it, but tons of people think they have it
Well vocaloid...meh
that and anime hates american tv
marshmallows?
yesh she is
...that works too
/me *noms all the raritys*
._.
and she is a brony/pegasister whatever you prefer
I'll just talk...to her...I guess...
huh
kinda removes the point of it being a fandom for the show
and seperates people

I had a derpy dream once...
It is my dream to put on a live version of this episode.
night guys.
:D
I do not own a fursuit
but I wish I did.
Rainbow Dash is me now :D

dat spike
gasp
I just realived the main 6 are 2 earth ponies 2 pegisi and 2 unicorns
/me is slow
Dat... dat
"Harmony is for the weak!"
Audible Gasp
SATIRE!
PEGISI PEGISI PEGISI
I really like Spike's theater voice. It's nice. :)
DAT SCENE CHANGE
Jeeeeez
These are craaaazy scene changes here. That's impossible..
All the unicorns do is day and night? Lazy sods!
I look at those earth ponies and all I hear is "Monty python, MONTY PYTHON!"
this is wut celestia calls "the great depression"
They need some Ood..
Bye, Brova :)
they need ga-
/me hugs everyone :)
seems the unicorns could easily take advantage of the other 2 tribes - if they can move the sun and move, they can take charge of the weather
/me puts away gun
Spike is the narrator(insert spike emote here)
*sun & moon
rabble rabble rabble
:D

Ahh, StarKid..
Oh pinkie :D

Well, I don't think they're quite as FAST as some other pegasi
windigoes
do we ever show any g2 or g3

hey
I dont know....Pony history is full of holes
Sparta!
lol
night guys
The first time I saw this episode, I saw the winter spirits and I thought ":O horses there are no horses in this... show... wait... one...."
i like spike
Spike is best pony!
yes
nein
hes not a pony
ouch pinkey
dat acting
I also have a theory that alicorns are just sort of a randomly occurring mutation and they're just exalted when they happen
That bow is adorable on Pinkie.
Due to the appearance of that one unicorn we saw, the assistant lady with the long horn and tall legs
/me drinks pop
being sillieh and all :2
:3&
I figure she's close to alicorn but didn't get the wings.
eh, close enough'
*BURP*
*one
stream
D:
rarity must be amazed at seeing ponies on stream
rarity hates bs stream
05back with an entire plate of ncaho salsa and chorizos
chorizos?
a pony riding a pony? Kappa
Twilight has been the most ridden pony in the show
chorizo? meat right?
Pinkie was best suited for this role
can't fault her logic
you can actually
up and down depends on choice of axis
Rewind, back it up
Applejack tends to be more logical than Twilight
plus twilight is more ocd
twilight is CDO
All time? ALL time?
i mean
dat EARTH!!!
Dirtville is best name. :D
get interactive
and be OCD?

One of the best songs in the entire show :)
08,01yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah
...Excuse me?
I wish an extended of this song would be released.
Agreed, Socks.

HAI
08,01Socks: best song

05ever had a 2x200gram hamburger?
Okay I really dont understand Saturn.
08,01spiders spiders spiders spiders

Saturn: kill em kill em kill em kill em
Cheeseburger

05they are yummy
All right, I must take off.

season 2 was meh
05hm?
I did enjoy the episodes from season 2
Yesterdays episode was very slice-of-lifeish. And thats a welcome break from the fast paced episodes that preceded it.
because people like the thing i like?
I think.
Brb guys
Ok
?
you need to be more specifit XD
don't get sushi
get a burger
even mashed potatoes would be good
sushi is good, but usually mediocre at a buffet >.>
Yeah
It was just..
Awkward.
ding ding ding!
Thing about buffets are, people other than the chefs touched my food.
^o^
a huge worm*
I was at a Chinese buffet and the name of it was...like...Delicious Something...and it was AWFUL!
IT PISSES ME OFF THINKIN ABOUT IT!!!!
He's a character from Persona 4.
The Kanji script is basically Chinese characters used in Japanese
When you speak Chinese it makes it a lot easier to know when you should leave a Chinese restaurant
those things are delicious
HOW. Just....HOW.
Characters banned?
That's quite silly. I mean, he's not THAT rigged.
BROOKLYN PARK RAGE!
You get up and politely leave.
Hey guys :)
Harro, Pony
Yu ^_^
last time i was at a chinese buffet was quiet some time ago
but i dont recall any blobfish
that shit's delicious
T~T
Did that work?
Awesome!
well, i think if it was in buffet you would remember this
Eep. I'd stay away.
:)
You know where I usually get my sushi at?
A JAPANESE RESTAURANT!
the sea
:OOOO
PLOTTWIST
Scootaloos come in a can.
I dont trust sushi that isn't from a Japanese place
I thought that was buffalo.
i've always wanted to try buffalo
Well, with buffalo in a can, you've gotta share.
gotta taste good to be hunted to near extinction
derp i bought tostitos without dip
Aw man, you dont get the joke xD
...
D'awwh <3
he just doesnt
People in hawaii and California get most of the good sushi restuants. You got to travel a bit if you want decent sushi in Massachusetts.
DAWNUKE http://fav.me/d5ms9cd
telapia is a good tasin fish
Tilapia?
/me explodes
yeah
tastes good
Tilapia is delicous :3
raw fish is dangerous
He can make anything you show him
Give him something to try and he can tell you nearly every ingredient in it just by taste
And then he'll cook it twice as good
yeup... i like sushi then i eat it, but i'm trying not eat it to ofter
:D
....Hawaiian temples?
It's not raw meat itself that's dangerous, but the pathogens that can be found on some meat products.
AW YEAH FINNTROLL IN THIS BITCH!
i mean you can eat rare meat...
would poppyseed dressing go well with chips tortilla chips to be exact
Hahaha..
Poppyseed dressing goes with everything.
Seriously?
In moderation.
Tartare steak?
Guys. Be nice.
Meat is best well done and slightly crispy
when my family was in Maui visiting my uncle's family - Dad's brother - we had ourselves a BBQ - got quite a few wierd looks from the locals - few have ever seen BBQ done right on the island
why is tonight the night of debate

It is possible.
I wish I could take you guys on a culinary experience - on all the local favs here in Cypress - most are discontinued now for many different reasons
Uhh, don't you mean CYPRUS?
Wick's Bar used to have a chef that made the juiciest steaks - at least a pound each
but in the end i didn't make it
You mean to tell me that Mexican food isn't normally made out of sand, Canary? D:
Taco bell is everything.but.mexican
XD
hey, taco bell aint too bad
That shit aint got nothing against real tacos
but taco bell is good...not amazing, but i still eat that
their volcano tacos are pretty good
but good
i prefer the beefy five layer burrito
next months food project fast food lasagnia
cause i dont have to spend a fortune and i can fill up fast
shit, i ate about 30 volcano tacos after a concert once
yeah, financially that was not my wisest decision
but it tasted good
dunno
i'm just glad i didn't get anything on my tuxedo that night
i just enjoy the taste of the beefy 5 layer
otherwise i mighta died the next day
Be thankful you got a teacher like that.
i know
and shes the head of the gaming club....why cant i have more awesome professors like her?
Worse, Canary. Taco Bell meat literally contains sand in it. >_>
...Wat
DIESELDODDEN

Oh man, I havent had a Frosty in such a long time.

And virtually boneless! - PO's Ostrich burger, gone as of last january - but they put a food challenge in its place - 5 lb burger - no one's finished it all yet
And if you want the best damn BBQ Houston has to offer - well, not IN Houston, just outside the limits - Carl's is THE place to be!

shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
Yay~
You wouldn't think that would be common.
a tad creepy
the nostalga
tom/jerry > mask ?
yes... it is
to check if there was anything on the line that would be tracking the phone
"Hello, tech support? Yeah, can I get help tracking my wife's phone?"
lel
more likely to get an intelligent answer if you call tech instead of billing on something like that
Still rather sad.
And a tad frightening.
one stupid dog:P
