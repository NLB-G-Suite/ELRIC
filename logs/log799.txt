And the pie is a fake.
but hey
gladiator is good
IT'S A CONSPIRACY
Coey890 u c wat I did thar
if not an overdone concept >.>
Who won with Mars Attacks? I like that movie, what little of it I have seen
Yeah.
yeah, this joke has dragged on wayy too long :D
*Pretends to roleplay as a dying roleplayer*
Coey890: So...the fake is a cake!?!
there i leave you guys alone for 5 minutes and suddenly the stream is gone
-__-
ElectricVelocity, thats deep
I know.
Hey Wrek I think the stream crashed
AssaultWithEmbraces: it's a masterpiece :D
it's your fault Dark_Horst. I was lurking O__O
yeah :(
I fell into the farthest pits of my mind ages ago.
No, he's just dead for a few minutres.
The extra lives will be deployed soon.
AssaultWithEmbraces: you dont like gladiator?
i can understand that
I have no social life.
I hear ya
Anyways, I'm going to go play some games and stufz. Bai :)
Coey890: Bye bye, and have fun
bye Coey890
bye guys
seeya Coey890
05jcelios: try refreshign
bye alexxm
Refreshing doesnt help :I
cya alexxm
I refreshed...still gone
I get black
Is this place usually streaming?
Yeah, it's down for some reason
Oh.
I came here before the new episode started and it wasn't working.
I don't really like oily half-naked men fighting :D I wanna see more historically accurate gladiator fights :D
So I went to BronyTV.
Bronysith: I've seen bits and pieces here and there
ElectricVelocity: Most likely the problem is on your end, about 4 to 5K people did get their stream via bronystate :S
05lemme fix that then
AssaultWithEmbraces: well watch the whole thing, it is still a good experience
But MadSurge, what's wrong with oily half-naked men fighting?
Right.
AssaultWithEmbraces: NOTHIGN
nothing wrong with oily men fighting
Well I can see the oily part being a turn off if they can deep fry something on their chests
Check this out http://www.tv.com/features/best-of-2012/vote/poll/SpecialFeatures:list:best-animated-series
Look at that little picture of the map up in the top left corner. It looks like a pony face kinda.
But half-naked men in general? Yummy~
05still nothing
AssaultWithEmbraces: I don't like men :D
05?
nothin
Just refreshed, nothing
AssaultWithEmbraces: but yes, you can like them :3
nope
same here
maybe the something is broken
Drew: Yup, that was/is a landslide...though pretty sure most of the votes should be void :P
It's Derpy.
Bronysith: /)
(\
05ok refresh now
AssaultWithEmbraces: you will love half naked russel crowe XD
Derpy why did you just played with the settings?
DERPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Works!
Bronysith: Ooooh will I now? ;D
yes
yay music again
works
it works!
Ew ads.
Hooraaah~
adblocker is your friend
Nah.
Together, we shall creep out the chat by admiring Russel Crowe!
Oh god, I love this song <3
I hate downloading random stuff.
Jonhy Guitar~
those who don't use adblock probably use IE
with what?
IE is best browser to find other browsers
How'd you know?
those without adblock need to learn to internet
...why?
IE FTL
over oiled up half naked men
I agree
hello peoplez
I like IE.
I'm here
Hello Mr_Anybody
...why?
HAI!!!!!
hey Mr_Anybody
ohai Mr_Anybody
I use Firefox. It's a lot less CPU intensive and it's got a bunch of good plugins like no script
Hi Mr_Anybody
which help prevent viruses
who streamin?
Bronysith: are you bi? :D
MadSurge: did you seriously not fuckign know?
Mr_Anybody look at the bottom right corner
It's not like his name is displayed on the bottom right corner >.>
did i try fucking hidign it?
well sorry
lol
i don't watch his that much
Bronysith: you did not bring up stallions.
Ghehehehe.
well
No harm done, Mr_Anybody. :P
braeburn is sexy easily
It did strike me as amusing though.
no excuses, its brony state 101, know who is streaming at ALL times
and tennant is jizz worthy
whoa
mini map looks like an evil pony now
What I said.
Mr_Anybody There is no learning effect if one is not aware of his mistakes :P
d3rb, I barely have an idea who's streaming half the time. :P
Keep in mind that not everyone uses IE by choice.
sorry :P
Also, what map editor is this?
I had to refresh
SC2?
i didn't know there was a contract i had to sign when i join
Lasharus ye
Lasharus, yup
*licks Drew just to annoy him*
Finally some good music.
D:
Blue Moon~
reminds me of fallout
lol
Mr_Anybody, because it is played in New Vegas
Can't wait for the expansion to SC2.
i played 3 not vegas
I rather watch others playing SC2 than myself^^
who here has ever played fallout 2?
I play it mostly for the campaign, ekips. :P
I don't get what he's making right now.
heh
how much stuff can you stuff in a stuffie 'till your stuffie stuffs enought stuff?
Yeah what he making
Have it downloaded Drew, still need to make some time to play the first >.<
Lasharus I also played only the campaing, and that with a friend' account :D
he's making a time machine
here... my results from da test: http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=Nzc4Mnw1NTUyODk
That's not blue or a Police Box.
I quite like the campaign, and want to know what happens next, basically :P
It's... a MAP of some kind (sorry, I really don't know any better than you).
It takes a while to beat
Look at the mini map guys
Mr_Anybody do not pony ponies who don't pony pony
im like Twirity Piedash
?
Uh huh :D
flutterpie
Mr_Anybody: Poni Poni, Pone.
Neeergh
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout

Lasharus same here, I hope I'll have enough time to play the next campaign by myself, else I have to watch a Let's Play or something like that >.>
is the stream loading for anyone else?
/me brews Jmo some tea

HERRO!
Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony

Sg. Blaze666 is that right?
Hi AdamTheDuck. I don't think so.
oh there going to have to glue you back together, IN HELL!
Gmod http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQqkbiVVLzA
Nope, so I was discussing possible ways to have a 24hr stream.
04Evening everyone, just want to take a second to remind you to not pay any attention to any PMs sent to you by the user "incog" That is all, thank you.
Ohai Ghosties.
DARN REVERSE PYCOLIGY
you got it Ghosties
If you're not on the site embed it would be best just to /ignore him
now i'm going to want to see it ;~;
He's PMing malware to people
Whats streaming?
AHH!! A GHOS...oh its just Ghosties , never mind
giggle at him
Twitch is being an ass to me right now
Nothing is streaming.
dat square
incog? ........seems legit
Mr_Anybody: some random encoding error i get, idk why
Ignored. Thanks for the headsup.
fom what i've heard
he's part of GNAA
thanks for the warning
GNAA?
04Just pay heed and ignore him
Derpy_Hooves: well its what he says
i have anti-virus so even if he did i wouldn't get it in ma system :$
Ghosties: got it,um do we just close the channel if it pops up? just asking to be sure
I would just hope someone isn't watching porn.
04Just close the PM
Well for one, that would require all users to run software to be streaming all the time, two it sounds incredibly complicated to set up, three they could show explicit content
>_>
got it thanks Ghosties :)
That would be..... wait wouldnt they have to accept the invitation?
04What he does is he sends the malware via links through PM
I'm totally not Mike >_>
04Yep, no problem Sketch
twixie_sprinkle: really? I thought it was /v/ the whole time, I guess I owe them a apology :(
thanks Ghosties now I GIGGLE AT YOU!
you're allowed to shair youtube vids when it's not streaming right?
Darf14: well nobody really knows who it was, but its very unlikely it was /v/
Mr_Anybody: 'Tis fine. I totally don't visit the artist Braeburned's e621 page.
me either >_>
yes Drew ,as long as its appropraite
kk
where is sb?
we need him noaw
good evening everypony
Then again V = Gamer, and I am a gamer, and as a gamer I see no reason to attack this site
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqAZlzvIDrs&list=PLA7E777995F7DD4AA&playnext=2
Darf14: It was more the minority of /v/ that hates us.
totally inappropriate
Drew: you once stood in front of a plant, pointed at it and said "KILL THIS PLANT"
oh....right, I am looking way too deep into it
>.>?
Darf14: You must'nt have been here when me and another brony were discussing magic, what it is, and how it relates to quantum mechanics and string theory.
what are we talking about?
seriously
Pepsi.
Mr_Anybody: Anything that is mentioned.
:O
I have no idea.
yeah, I havent been to bronystate very much Mike due to college, so I havent read any discussion that you were talking about
OLD SPICE!

Darf14: If I could have recorded it, I would have. I still remember the details, so I could recite it, but it would take up a bit of space.

Darf14: Found my sumarization i had saved
'K thanks
coold
Darf14:Someone mentioned Pegasi wings, and that their magic lets them fly. I then theorized that magic needs a focal point(A pointy object, something or other), hence Wands, Unicorn Horns, and Pegasi feathers. Some things are better at 'conducting' magic, if you will. Earth ponies have no focal point, thus the constant emanation of magic causing plants to grow.Why gems are good stores of magic was then asked: and i answered with ano

ZombiU, Scary title
Solved my problem! New tab in chrome for the stream, dragged to one side and kept chat on the other.
Thank you windows 7.
zombiU is pretty good imo, plus i like the final death thing they have
I made 1 very vague (but obvious) pony reference (for bronies) on NSMBU, and no one noticed it yet :D
Either way, Zombies
Vague yet obvious
Okay then
Fuck logic
ZombieU takes a little to get into,but it gets awesome
?
all I said was " I captured Nabbit in 10 seconds flat"
ZombiU has a nice thing with final death i like that
playing as different people different times
hey
What if...
There was a pony game for the wiiU

sonicdude558: Okay, you have to make it

the timing is way off
what app is this?
yeah the timing is indeed off sadly :(
that's what he gets for using flash ;_;
XD

11,02Flash has a minimum input delay of like 100 ms, which doesn't work.

Cause I got no clue.
04Well, you're pretty darn close
/me revs up chainsaw
SuperBrony64: how's the longest
Wirks fer me
04I've been with the staff since the second BMN
how are you Ghosties
11,02I founded the site. I founded it when my family was movin' west from 4chan way.
ALRIGHT EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR!
04And no, I do not know you, Prince_Lightstar
11,02Lookin' for dem here internetz in a new land

11,02texasboykc09: I honestly didn't start the site :P

OHHHHH YOU MEAN THIS PIE!

SuperBrony64: whi did
Hi geeky

11,02But when I first visited it I thought 'Wow, what a trash-hole, guess I'll make home here.'

Why did I laugh? Just...why?
08,01i once had an assassin try to kill me with a silk scarf
08,01he was killing me softly with his sarong

EVERYONE IS A FAILURE!
11,02Hyperbole? Oh yeah? Well...your mom is so fat her de Broglie wavelength can be measured on a macroscopic scale.
...

EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU HAS FAILED!
/me opens google
Did you need to look up that insult SuperBrony64?
your moms so fat when she made her playstation account the network crashed
11,02Buytoast: No O~O
04Haha, Buytoast called you out
/me 08,01gives Prince_Lightstar an apple
we need more powder
SuperBrony64 you want my cookie
11,02Yesh :D
your momas so fat when she wore a yellow shirt people thought she was the shcool bus
08,01doesn't de broglie wavelength decrease as mass increases?
school*
Not these jokes...
Mr_Anybody: :D
08,01because it has more energy, becase E = mc^2?
i think de broglie wave is h/p
.......
08,01frequency increases
it also depends on the speed, as well as mass
08,01so wavelength decreases?
bigger mass, smaller wavelength
08,01aye
your moma's so fat her drinvers lisence test was on a dino
heh nintendo times
old i meant
04Gettin' all sciency up in 'ere
Dun like science.

Well, astronomy.
SCIENCE IS FER EGGHEADS

How can you not like astronmy?
That shit's fun
No. I mean I prefer astronomy.
herro XAX
good
Hi Mr_Anybody
arg
The only thing that truly amazes me.
hey do i smell?
astronomy takes a lot of memorization, astrophysics is better
use the force.
/me sniffs pits
/me 08,01wishes he had the money for some fancy astrophotography equipment
Ponies47: gev mah ya gold matey
Ghosties: does Hipster Brony still come to brony state at times?
twixie_sprinkle: may i nom ur ear >:3
04I doubt it
YOUR MOM HAS MONEY FOR ASTROTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT
Prince_Blueblood: okay, but leave some of it, i still need it o.o
11,02hmmm...guess you are right, the de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum...and since velocity doesn't change, the mass has to.
04I still talk with him but he's busy helping out at other pony sites
Good on him.
SuperBrony64: YOU FAIL, YOU GET NOTHING, GOOD DAY SIR
GUYS DISREGARD SCIENCE AQUIRE STREAM!!!!

CTHULHU: when well you come and distory the humans
04Yes, I am still up. Tis the wekeend, after all
Ghosties: Touché

SuperBrony64: why cant u stream on the bronystate website
04Hey Chrysalis, long time no see
Trust me you don't need my hel to do that.
help*
SuperBrony64 show me all the p's
Still nothing in my email so.......thats good
11,02Prince_Lightstar: I can...as long as you're using a non-chrome browser. Twitch has these strict requirements about streaming using an iFrame which has a workaround as long as you use a non-Chrome browser. I can only stream my consoles using my newer and better capture card using Twitch.
11,02JRP2234: Sure :)
TO MANY WORDS
CTHULHU: but its 2012 the stars shold be right soon
SuperBrony64 you missed one

God dang it SuperBrony64 its not horrbile ok
SuperBrony64: :D
SB tries so hard and is still told no

BUNK, BUNK I SAY!!!
11,02JRP2234: No :<
get to it lazy bum :P
11,02weylin|Blarg: I'm sorries ;A;
Quick, protect the cookies! :<
11,02O.O
Umm actually xbox console is way better then the wii U thing so..................sorry
Audible gasp!
PC is master race
11,02Cookehs O^O
SuperBrony64 draw it plz
oAo THE COOKIES! I COMPLETELY FORGOT!
Dat loading circle.
You need to update more dude.
SuperBrony64 boring give us le wii u
Wow. I got scared by my dog sneezing. Beautiful.
So xbox elite vs wii U to see which consoles wins in first place
lol jojoyasmin
ohh ok
xbox would win
sorry for being so idly, was on the phone
its not made by nintendo
jojoyasmin: Aww.
its ok
i vote for the xbox as well
Xbox all the wway!
soo sleepy though -_-
I was just sitting there and... it was quiet and he sneezes loud ._.
xbox FTW
yeah same]
jojoyasmin: How big is your dog?
but then, my pc is far better in every way than my xbox
I guess he's about medium sized
it even boots quicker and loads games faster
I see
are you heading to bed soon?
I have a husky, but she's too hyper. :D
im back
Welcome back, geeky. :)
wii gives you great games xbobx gives you great online play ps3 gives you didley dick
My dog is like lab and some other dog breed XD not too sure
Probably in an hour, maybe 2
hello geeky
apout time
wbu?
JRP2234 really.. great games?
thanks AJIsAwesome and huskys are good dogs
they all look appalling
thansks weylin|Blarg
zelda
probably a hound, if it's medium sized
:)
MUTHER FUKING ZELDA
^
might in a few minutes
zelda is lame
wut
What's wrong with Zelda?
lel
slow boring, uninteresting story
Zelda. Is. Amazing.
CTHULHU: i was sacrfing some ones new born for you
No. It. Isn't
zelda is ok
:I
dafuq is this
massively overrated
My soul...
SuperBrony64 netfliz
.....
I was raised on Zelda .-.
I like Zelda. I don't love it, but I like it.
Hey Sorry SuperBrony64 but a xbox FTW so....................sorry dude
i was raised on duke nukem and quake
okay.... after reading this story, I can officially say that humans... as a species.... is SERIOUSLY messed up
in the head
sadly they changed the music in the remastered version of budokai 3
:<
Actually it depends on what zelda games you're talking about because I don't like a few.
Did you eat it and drink its blood? Remember waste not want not.
hi
Hi, aniderp.
'lo aniderp
'ello, aniderp!
11,02Moopy: Sorry...Xbox is last gen...sorry :(
ello aniderp
Hmph
SuperBrony64 so is the wiiu
alo aniderp
its only just caught up
11,02Chrysalis: Next gen~
but then they waste so much potential with that POS controller
But still xbox is freakin way better the wii U console so yeah
remove that controller
lel
rebuild the CPU/GPU
I miss my xbox before it was destroyed by a glass of water. And then I got the 360.
then you can call it next gen
SNES
:)
nintendo lost the plot since the '64
so what you planning to play on teh xbox SuperBrony64?
11,02I still got the plot~
well tbh, they did drop the ball since the psx/SNEScd fiasco
goodnight
night
But heres the thing though i play the wii console sometimes but not all the time im just more into the xbox consoles so xbox elite FTW yay
What's the point of the Wii U? It seems pointless for me to upgrade.
jojoyasmin the point is to give ninendo money
Pfft. Mine.
ghost nappa!
then again, all 3 consoles make the same mistake
SuperBrony64 how long has i been offline?
no cross-platform multiplayer
AJIsAwesome: :D
0_0
?
...
the problem I see, is xbox/microsoft
Chrysalis:
SuperBrony64 talk to us
What?
serioulsy, just hook em all up to the same servers
???
nono
and let the PC dominate the console players
SuperBrony64 is that you talking
But console is better.
the problem is microsoft wants to charge for every game patch, every expansion, etc
CTHULHU you are misguided
11,02JRP2234: no o.o
hmm
How so sir?
pcs are better in almost every regard
faster, more powerful, more flexible
free online
cheaper games
in what way?
...
see: TF2, Dust514 (and why they went with PS3 instead of XBox
so what it doesn't mattter about the charges dude its about having fun on the console so yeah
ffjsdlkfjslafjsafj;sfjs;lajfs;
SuperBrony64 hows voic can i hear?
Moopy's right.
Moopy: Actually, the charges are important as well.
All i do on my pc is play games
teh whatever man
so that argument really doesnt hold
its not so much a hardware incompatability, its the business... style between Microsoft and Sony
and the game designers
blah blah blah blah yeah right................hmph
oh yeah, its easy enough to make the systems play with eachother, see brink and *game i forgot the name of*
Hello Everypony :3
Yo
Hi, SkunkTauri.
problem is console players dont like playing people who can actually PLAY the damn games
ello SkunkTauri
rather than rely on autoaim
and autoaim is not a result of the controller
see even for me dude all i do is try to have fun on the xbox elite console and talk to my friends thats all i do so yeah
you can be just as good on a controller as a KB/M
00,10dat off line
Oh hi there sumica
ohai sumi
I hope SB knows the stream's offline.
00,10ohhi
I really don't like playing online with people. They just sit there and yell at you because they're being an idiot and blaming you.
^
11,02HAi Sumica :)
jojoyasmin: you arent playing with the right people :)
a wild Sumica appeared
thats why i mostly buy santbox games.
also hi sumica
so what dude we all get freakin blamed so what big freakin deal man jeese
I've had both positive and negative experiences with online people, but I still enjoy it.
Ryunosuke: I would if my friends played the same games as me :P
:)
again, its a system thing
same here AJIsAwesome
iv never had whiny kids on pc
but i have on my xbox
eggs
AJIsAwesome: eggs
Chrysalis: 3 words
hell, the games even play better
Team. Death. Match. :)
Everytime on the xbox. *playing the game correctly*
cite: BlOps on xbox/pc both with a controller
And this is why i play the xbox elite to talk to my friends online thats what i ever do so deal with it dude
the pc plays smoother and faster
Someone else: "OMG NOOB! YOU KILLED ME!"

i want a battel
:3
11,02You won't be able to hear my voice :(
Poom: He's already played the Wii system, if I recall. He then switched to the XBOX.
10 year olds swearing at me. Which I admit is kinda funny to hear XD
Hi, Invi. :)
It always feels good to headshot little kids out of left field, then hear then complain, imo
SuperBrony64, then who's voice am I hearing on the Sb stream?
jojoyasmin: Why is why I always mute them if they persisit.
*persist
*Which is why
SuperBrony64, hoof in your mouth again?
AJIsAwesome: cause of me.
AJIsAwesome: Well now I just turn voices off. I'm just talking about what happened before I git annoyed
got*
[03:33:02] <jojoyasmin>Someone else: "OMG NOOB! YOU KILLED ME!" -- stop walking in front of my line of fire dumbass :)
Geez typos...chill.
*SIGH* jeese
Ryunosuke: :D Exactly!
my favorite lately has been tank drivers in PS2, almost as bad as BF2... ALMOST
:D
11,02Can you all hear me? :O
si, senor
Before, yes.
SuperBrony64: ?
or more like "omg ur hacking!"
Not now though
"a whole road to drive on, and half the time I am not even ON the road, and I get run over"
Yep, SuperBrony64.
00,10you est quiet
...
ahh
It's always the fault of the good players
better
Somewhat, SB. Just turn it down a Little bit. :)
00,10no but we hear you pc fan =p
wow, xbox is WAY behind
what do you mean behined?
xbox fans are loud
:I
PC Minecraft is way better
like mine
its missing SO many features
Moopy: I think it terms of features.
*in terms
smallchild1024: Agreed.
like what kind?
let me get a list
inb4 big ass list
the controls for the xbox version could be better
boop
a) the world is limited on the xbox
b) only 8 players at a time per world
c)texture packs
teh i don't care about that
d) in game difficulty switching
barely any room for exploration
e) mods
SB, I think we get it. :D
f)skins
hold, im writing notes
00,10So you are saying the PC master race wins yet again
Damn you people! I'm probably going to open minecraft again
g) loads of items / blocks
push....button....open...door
h) upside down blocks
It's true.
they need to implement infinite terrain for the xbox
PC is the master race.
SB, why do you have fire directly below you? ._.
smallchild1024 they can't
^]
the xbox physically can't handle a bigger world
whats a terrain?
/me facedesks
Wow.
Seriously.
00,10cause he likes warm floors
....
...
What?
Moopy: A piece of ground having specific characteristics or military potential.
i've seen how much the xbox can't handle from playing other games co op online
/me is having an aneurysm
booooooo!
i'm headed for bed. later, all
BYe, weylin|Blarg.
terrain -> Gameworld
Sheesh, that's a fast cart.
nothing can be endless.
i have mined out larger areas than the xbox can even store
CTHULHU the pc version supports 2billion blocks
'Nothing can be endless'
LOL
SuperBrony64: just put the ladder 1 block higher
dat jaymoo
and?
http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1345/70/1345705036366.jpg
it would take several MONTHS of non stop travelling to hit that limit
Well fuck you too twitch. It hasn't been showing me the stream and I wouldn't have known it was on without the chat
xbox would only take an hour or so
00,10well there is a mode that has a game world larger then the earth
thats not so great.
Well im going to play some minecraft on my xbox elite but i'll still be here in the chat so yeah
00,10but, the save game would be larger then our current abilty to store
really?
seen the middle earth map?
recreating the entirity of middlearth in minecraft
looks damn good
00,10they dont make a harddrive big enough to save said game
PC Minecraft world has the potential to be 8 times the size of the Earth
also
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #520
pc realises gamers know how to play games
xbox has to give a tutorial
I cant get into minecraft it looks like to much work.
too
00,10PC has web pages taht are easaly accesd
much work?
00,10they have tutorials
Depends on how you play.
/me twitches
punch tree how hard is that
huh, my current game world is 6 times larger than the xbox can create
If you prefer survival and doing things legit, then yeah there's a bit of time involved.
use wood to make tools use tools to get better materials rinse and repeat
theres another difference
But creative mode, if you prefer that, it doesn't take much time to build.
pc, zombies can break doors down
moo
thats not one of the rules.
well xbox is behind in updates :I
if the xbox could support java, there wouldn't be as many update problems
MS wouldnt let it support java though
ll
the xbox really wouldnt like it
hardware wouldnt handle it well
how so?
I hate when I can't get through doors...
but the reason the game runs so smooth on xbox is because its written in c++ and the code is more efficient than java
And then I run at them ten times
oh yeah, more food types on the pc
is this happenning
your not destined to just eat bread
but bread s good.
The game has to constantly tell you how to do things (e.g., the buttons on the bottom left)
what do you zapp apples would taste like irl
spicy?
awesome
sour?
does the xbox have the end yet?
Like Zap Apples?
or hardcore mode
the xbox couldn't handle the end
doubtful the players could handle hardcore
and with limited map sizes, finding a stronghold is nearly impossible
That creeper made me jump ._.
why is justin tv being stupid
djblazekin: What browser are you using?
damn pig
google chrome it worked fine yesterday for the live stream of the new ep
djblazekin: You'd have to use either Firefox or another browser. Chrome isn't exactly compatible with Justin TV.
interesting fact: minecarts have different physics settings when they are empty, and when they have something in them
chrome fails. firefox ftw :D
What will you name him, SuperBrony64?
firefox fails
it's saying loading the justin tv player in a frame is not allowed
opera ftw

Hey guys waht if i type something on the ponychat on my screen here like "apples"
CTHULHU: /) HELL YAH

CTHULHU: i love power metal \m/
CTHULHU: but i dont think DIO is power metal
like if i click the ponychat and type apples what would it say in there?
i love the ponie re enact series
...apples???? i guess?
Moopy, when you are in the bronystate channel, yes
Dio is heavy metal not power metal.
CTHULHU, dio has done almost everything
and he is a god for that may he rest in pice.

d3rb: no
Lol... the way he turned. "What now?!"

the only reason i buy sports games and then look up possible leaks of team scheduals then set up the matches cpu vs cpu and watch it go
Just fine geeky :)
Going to restart this laptop, brb in a bit

AdamTheDuck: ok see yah soon

I kinda dislike the fact that it's just small changes for the most part each year.
If Imma buy the newer game, you better have new stuff for me
11,02Boring
And not small things
well its just soccer, cant exactly reinvent the wheel there
lel sb
thats because they didn't use the new engine for the wii u version same prob on madden and nba 2k

It could be kirby lol
roggenrola
08,01okay, so
i think it is kirby
...
Hoshi no Kaabii
08,01i don't think rainbow dash is a lesbian, contrary to the general consensus of the fandom
08,01but i do think scootaloo is
Cleffairy
is what?
08,01also, lunaception is awesome
yep
Rainbow Dash is tomby not Lesbian
*tomboy
Scootaloo isn't lesbian o.o
^
<
she's just a fangirl
lol
or stalker
Scoots is my fave CMC
I think we all agree, we'd love the ponies no matter their preference
08,01well, in my mind, i can totally not see her enjoying being with a stallion
Scootaloo is a lesbian?
Or would we?
08,01when grown up, tha tis
d3rb_: there's a differance :S
d3rb_: no difrence
lol
yeah...
ok you 2 fight it out, winner is right
I don't think they'll ever grow up though XD
If Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash are lesbians, then... the makers wouldn't allow that to be the case, so at least I know it isn't true.
LOL
ponies live a very long time
08,01also, is it just me, or has applebloom's voice become really weird recently?
^
Didn't notice :P
VA is probably just gettin older
Ah puberty. Gets the best of em...
bye BS
too bad :(
Also, dat twilight
by KrazyNoobs
later KrazyNoobs
twilight sparkle with alicorn amulette vs 7th year harry potter who'd win the magic duel
indeed, dat twi
...
twi would distroy everything :I
I don't care for Harry Potter over all... so I dunno
08,01twilight sparkle with alicorn amulette = god tier
twilight has lost control over her power when she did the magic exam
when she was a filly
i forgot harry with voldamorts wand
naw...
weak
08,01harry potter: wands akimbo
That rainboom must have scared the crap out of her to make her powers go all crazy
08,01but no, i think twi would win
08,01because honestly, harry is a pretty average wizard
08,01not god-tier powerful like twiliht
08,01only his mother's sacrifice protected him
jojoyasmin: The sonic Rainboom caused a domino affect down the line
08,01there's nothign really all that special about him
the scar....
um
yea
:I
08,01also, have some scootaloo: http://du.cx/2rC
he did defeate the most powerfull dark wizard
SkunkTauri: This I know, but still. "Oh man I'm going to fail this exa--OH SHI" *crazy magic*
08,01djblazekin: through a fluke
Basically what I think happened
jojoyasmin: XD
/me 08,01can't actually remember how he defeated him
08,01magic of friendship or some shit
o_____O Twilight?
You okay?
nah cuz that would have required five others
theres a seventh element now, The power of love
Pinky Pie can bends reality :I
grammar fail ^
but harry beat vuldamort one on one
the elements of harmony + the power of love= ownage
where as twilight had the other five join her to defeat discord, nightmare moon and crystalys
08,01wait, wasn't it neville who eventually kills voldemort?
08,01or am i remembering it wrongly?
Man. I haven't drawn any new art lately...
djblazekin, but he has hands and wizard technology
neville was voldemort
:I
Shining Armor and Cadence defeated Chrysalis
harry kills him off
which was the last horcrux
jojoyasmin, stop talkin & start drawin :P
What's up with the Ponies with wings and unicorns? sorry im new :I
d3rb , I would if I wasn't ina lazy mood XD Otherwise I'd be working on my OCs
11,02This one is much harder than I expected...
drew, alicorns
oh :o
i wonder if they are going to add anymore alicorns
opa gangnam style
i hope not
i was confused once about the allicorn thing too
too many means they're not special
^
There are 4 right?
will there be a male alicorn
Princess Celestia, luna and cadence is enough already
What about the evil one?
a male black and red alicorn as fanservice for all the oc's that look the same
oh yeah..
chrysalis is a changeling queen also an alicorn
Humm. There are a lot of red and black OCs
my oc is a ponyfied version of toonami tom
Luckily, mine aren't ^^
I attempted to ponify a lot of characters. Most of the time thee look iffy
they*
I've* Really?
i just make one drawing drag out for months on end then not finish it :)
i cant draw at all :C
same here :l
everyone can draw
I try to finifh in one sitting, otherwise there's a chance of not finishing my stuff
well*
finish* GAH
i cant even draw a square with straight lines
or a good circle
You can if you use Photo shop
i just tried drawing a 'perfect' square, i failed
Well that's just difficult without a ruler or straight line tools in drawing programs
hmm, getting close now
But I can't really say anything, especially when I have to draw circles for people XD
im wishing i had very good drawing skills
just takes time and practice
like any skill
Yep
i draw like a kindergardner at age 18 which is quite sad :'(
lady pixle heart is best artist
My mood goes down the tubes when I go to DA
jojoyasmin, lol i know right
front page.....fuck this *throws tablet in bin*
i very rarely go on DA
"This is so amazing" *just a plain pony*
i mostly spend time on FA
*gets online and sees amazing samurai pony at sunset*
"...well."
DA may as well be FA
Basically XD it's all you see
most art on DA is tame
FA, the front page is porn
all red bordered pictures
fae vallentine ponified would look better than silverspoon and diamand tiara and actually would put them to shame
Oh look at twilight now
Messages on DA: 2,053
._.
what's a da? >.>
thx :l
Mmhmm
/me hates being new
Ah, it's fine. It'll get better eventually
unfortunately da is slowly becomming myspace

Hehe

My favoreite question: Bacon.

bacon is over rated
Pfft
Is not!
my anime crush is kagome from inuyasha whats yours
/me only watched Inuyasha once to see why her friends liked it
Didn't see why.
11,02What do you think Twilight should say relating to Nintendo? o.o
...
*processing....processing* Uh...stuff?
something something superscope
xbox is my friendship problem
....
"i tried to beat battletoads"
Wtf
i heart princess trollestia
Nazi TV show?
Why is this on?
?
here's one
"So about that new Paper Mario game..."
"if i have to tell you wii u is next gen one more time...."
bit long
friendship level is over 9000
This show, "I just think races should live in their own country"
Wtf?
:D
make twilight say that :D
XD I have no idea why the show is on
Inuyasha really is on...damn.
yes that fox kid is mischevious
Terrible show
I guess I'll watch with you
11,02Look good?
XD I turn it on and all I see is "BLARRRGH"
i need some sleep o.o
Yes

early 90's anime is awsome
yep. thats spot on

Oh god! GIRL! Get off the ground! There's a male voice!
Oh it's the creepy weird dude
Oh what? Games? Are you sure SB?
/me licks SuperBrony64 "Who's a silly filly?" :3

/me licks AdamTheDuck back 'meh? :oc'
??
i sent adult swim a tripple dog dare to show a mlp fim mareathon on april 1st 2013
what just happened?
jojoyasmin, normal bronystate chat
OH what?
XD
Random shit I think just happened?
djblazekin lol
Also, I would love adult swim even more if they did
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Adult Swim says that bronies are the 3rd creepiest people in the world, so I don't think that's a possibility. :'(
Example taken
...asshats
XD Oh man I just imagines an ass hat
imagined*
Wait creepy??
Spectre yes... behind two types of furries. I hate that
Of course they're probably looking at the creepy bronies
they do stand out
And the non-normal ones that actually do stuff and are normal
ARE IGNORED
we can only blame the rule 34 bronies
jojoyasmin To non-bronies, every brony is creepy. They should at least know that there are two types of bronies: cloppers-who-go-to-bronycon and people who enjoy the show
Also, ignore that non...
because the weird ones seem to want everyone to know what they dio
KrazyNoobs that's retarded not all bronies are messed up in the head
Spectre I never said that... I said most non-bronies think that. people who have never heard of our fandom will assume that we are messed up, while that is very far from reality
to a 'normal' person i can see how they could jump to that conclusion
If bronies were a group of about 100, about 10-15 of them would be the clopper s and the rest, normal
huh whats this
Chrysalis, Sparta?
-.-
madness?
Maybe more or less cloppers
Insanity?
Yeah that's stupid I'm a brony but I'm actually against clopping period so yeah
jojoyasmin That would mean there are 200,000 cloppers... i cannot get myself to believe that
Pahaha
Is SB still streaming?
Like I said, more or less :P
yep blops 2
ah its the bit of blops i will never seer
j
the mp
jj
But considering the amount of non-cloppers, it's very annoying how people only focus on the cloppers
jjj
jojoyasmin people always focus on the vocal minority
Of course.
jojoyasmin I know that feel. Tosh.0, I love that show, but Daniel Tosh's job is to insult people, so we cannot say that was not going to come
And that's how stereotypes are born
V_V
Dayum dats sum guuuuuud cheeyiken
MAde me sad though, man. Very sad...
Also "HEY LOOK! One black guy has chicken and purple koolaid! I bet they all love that!"
if rarity had the personality of fae vallentine she'd be mor tollerable
They actually showed MLP:FiM Rule 34 on national television with Tosh.0, and now about 3 million people may think of us as sick to the head.
Well that'
purple drank
Welcome to society jojoyasmin.
Hit enter early
KrazyNoobs did Tosh seriously do that??
yep
that's lovely*
6_9
Spectre look it up on Youtube, that is, if you can tolerate looking at Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash doing things...
Now I have the sudden urge to beat the shit out of Tosh now
flutterdash is a cute yuri couple
It's funny, I hardly say anything pony related to my friends and I'm weird and talk about ponies too much. But then they start talking about their TV shows every two seconds.
Pfft
I saw that once, and it enraged me, and scarred me for about twelve and a half minutes
Who the hell puts up two ponies doing things on national television? Just to scar all of us non cloppers?! Bullshit
jojoyasmin A boy at my school is 'cool' for watching Gossip Girl, apparently. If you say you like My Little Pony, your going to have a BAD time.
trolling Spectre, to get a reaction from viewers or fans
it's a back 2 back inuyasha
What I mean is, boys can watch stupid chick shows without criticism, while a show that is ACTUALLY good will get you laughed at
KrazyNoobs: Well. Bullshit. It's more accepted at my school though as long as you don't talk about it as much as everyone talks about "normal shows"
ABC.com Ages 2-6 WTF??????
I only mentioned it once when we were talking about fandoms, and they were all like, WTF.
I always did think Tosh was an ass
PonyGirl123 are you talking about the reviews for MLP:FiN
I suppose it's more acceptable for me though. I'm a girl. It's still weird to them. But my guy friend says one thing, ONE THING, pony related and they look at him worse than me
No Its On Twitch TV On My Computer
ima musiscabnn
my cuzin thinks i'm wierd for liking mlp fim and said it's not cool and that strawberry shortcake had better animation
ima banana
jojoyasmin Girls at my school watch Bob the Builder and Wow Wow Wubbsy, and they are the ones that laugh at me.
lolwat
11,02I'm getting tired -.-
/me throws bread at SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64
KrazyNoobs: Whaaat? Now those are stupid!
Go to bread young man
/me dies
KrazyNoobs that's just......wow I'm a guy and I find that hilarious
Especially in comparison to mlp!
did you draw mine yet or just keep ignoring me
11,02JRP2234: I'll draw it when I can
jojoyasmin Spectre and guys watch Pretty Little Liars and Gossip Girl. Doctor Who, I can tolerate a bit more.
I feel like punching people...
doctor whooves and the assistant got me into watching doctor who
But then I'd look obsessed
Or whatever
djblazekin yay
man zelda is as overated as dr who
That one guy: "Actuaaaaally..."
Everytime....
You know what else's overated? Midi
mutated minty on inuyasha
midi?
yeah~~
seriously? midi?
i dont get it...
Dafuq is that guy on Inuyasha?!

Dragon Ball Z was better
ima egg
ima SuperBrony64
11,02Thanks for tuning in all :3
ima tree
Spectre I think relationships are the main cause for boys watching these: to impress girls. I am yet to see a single female in modern day society between the age of 8 and 16 who doesn't like One Direction. All the girls in my school do, and the boys pretend to love One Direction now. Everything about mainstream society these days is f---ed up.
wait
Dragon Ball Z is always better
SuperBrony64 isent it happening?
thnaks for stream SuperBrony64
KrazyNoobs, oh I know a few...
thanks** derp
cept gangnam style
brb
that stuffs just cool
and better than biber
Gangnam is a song I was never able to listen through
KrazyNoobs, wait....guys liking one direction.....
I hate one direction... I was at the poster section of a store and these two girls ran up squealing at the posters
LAWL
my gf hates twilight saga and one direction she is 13 i'm 14
!
SuperBrony64
I just had a realization
its happening SuperBrony64
11,02Refresh embed everypony~
Yup, d3rb. Just to impress girls. Stupid, huh?
lol, morons
suddenly fire
the last episode "Sleepless in Ponyville" was a Scootaloo episode, about her... being a chicken
KrazyNoobs that just tells you right there how desperate guys can get so glad I'm not like that at all if I'm going to impress a girl I'm going to do something other then watch those retarded shows
Not just to impress
Friggin squealing girls running through stores, looking at 1D...makes us all look bad
People like things because they like it
i mean if they actually like them fine (they have terrible taste but fine)
Yay the fire place
Spectre I'm asexual (no sexuality), so I am very confused by all of this, but I am glad that I am not a slave to sex.
I'm very sexual, and I am not a slave to sex
teh fire
And she's awesome
asexuality is a very, very, rare function, extremely few people have it, but tons of people think they have it
KrazyNoobs trust me man I'm 100% straight and I even find that rediculous
djblazekin You sure she's a girl? Faith in humanity has been restored
Well vocaloid...meh
SuperBrony64 your forgetting somthing
yesh she is
/me passes jojoyasmin a rarity
...that works too
/me *noms all the raritys*
._.
and she is a brony/pegasister whatever you prefer
I'll just talk...to her...I guess...
huh
i never did like the whole pegasister thing
apparently Lucky Star is getting a new season
WHAT
Spectre: Awesome, I have watched as the kids I grew up with have become disgusting pieces of crap, always making jokes about sex and 'how much they love it'. Because I don't have sex in my life, I have actually done stuff, I have been put into an extension program that my school runs, and am already half-way through a Marine Biology degree at an age of 17, I'm still in Year 12
WHAT?!
kinda removes the point of it being a fandom for the show
and seperates people
LUCKY STAR?!
Ahem...I mean, cool/
That's nice.
glad jersey shore is ending now if only mtv went off the air entirely

WHAT? Inuyasha is showing a family of those weird things?
crackers and choclate
SuperBrony64 your forgetiing that its happening now
/me curls up by the fire -u-

KrazyNoobs nice, yeah I just find it retarded "What's that you want to go watch Gossip Girl because you think all the girls will like you then? F*** you I'm just going to go play some Silent Hill I mean damn"
11,02JRP2234: Played it already :(
:>
dang it
Spectre I think you got the wrong impression, not many people bother enjoying thigns just for the sake of attention
08,01so NASA are working on implementing a "warp field interferometer"
Vivix you'd be suprised
Humm?
they might say they enjoy something for sake of attention, but actually go through with it?
No, I doubt I'd be surprised, there's going to be some, but few
Chat is busy this morning, nobody even noticed me come in. :D

I've seen it too, but it usually does not last, and it almost never works, most people who enjoy something like- a guy liking One direction, genuinly appreciates it
i legitly hate jersey shore and the live action stuff on cn and adult swim

dat NO
/me sides have been lost
I suppose that's true all I'm saying is guys shouldn't like girl shows just to get their attention
08,01it sounds cool, and, well, it is
brb
no, I agree with that, but guys will like girly things, and girls will like guy-ish things, without it being-- you know, fake
Well see if it's not fake then I don't have a problem with it
ahkai, good good

Just because I'm being lead by side videos
Djblazekin well yeah there's alot of tomboys out there
most girls I've known have been nerds and tomboys
i am but a mere idiot
08,01they want to "creat conditions similar to what drives the expansion of the cosmos"
first girl I befriended played doom
08,01yayphysics! \o/
Hey Doom is an epic game
okay now im probably going into the deep end here and onto a topic people hate buuut....
/me 08,01likes Desperate Housewives and Charmed unironically
it was, yeah
08,01also, don't think any less of me, but... i like My Little Pony...
oh its so nice to gather round the warm furnace :)
/me was a big Cole fan
I loved Gilmour Girls
or whatever its called in english :D
SuperBrony64: \:3/
08,01Spectre: Cole was awesome and really hot!
08,01but Leo was hotter
Leo?
Wasn't he really plain?
08,01Vivix: plain?! buff, more like
aahh
08,01with a wonderful smile
Long time since I've seen charmed-
never followed it
i liked hi hi puffy amiyumi a cartton aimed for girls and my parents didnt complain i watched and enjoyed sailor moon another show aimed tward girls but when my mom walked in and saw me watching mlp fim she asked if i was gay
08,01d3rb: it's odd, here in the uk, there's not so much religious fanaticism
What was that young guy in in Gilmour Girls?-- the rebel
Although odd to say my favorite from Charmed was always Darrell
djblazekin: XD
08,01certainly not so much of a religious culture as the US
or well, once, there were 3 religious girls in my shcool
yeah, im lucky to be in australia...by comparison to us in that regard at least
then again, I respect and love religion
08,01which means that when i see the US "atheist movement" i feel a great swell of pride, like a mother watching her child take its first steps
^
08,01except in this case, it's truth instead of walking
Most atheists I've met are more intrusive and aggressive than Jehovas
a little late
so I don't really want to be associated with them
08,01Chrysalis: i'm so proud of them, still
08,01they're becomeing civilised
winter is coming :S
cause even if there were a god
08,01finally
he would be such a prick
I met who?
New pone was great last night.
Oh, yes
Isnt it still under spoilers
Hi
less than 24 hours
Lol hello Vivix
08,01now don't get me wrong; i have no hate of people because of their religion. you don't hate someone just because they're wrong.
people are free to believe what they want
We arent getting into a religion vs atheism debate are we?
Chrysalis: ;_; yes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95_1fPf2dhs
as long as they dont force it upon others
that goes for all of us, yeah
Doctor Who is best religion.
we who don't believe, should not force others to not
is it just me or do lps and mlp have some of the same vas
they do
Yes yes yes!
/me comes back shocked to see people fighting over religion
Fireplace hour on BronyState!
Alchemist I freaking hope not I can't stand getting into religious fights
00,02"White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer" whoever came up with this name was a star trek fan, i sware
KrazyNoobs, you must be imagining the fighting part
this is far from a fight
this is very civilized
08,01i'm actually thinking of making a brony mockumentary that takes the piss and makes us out to be a religious cult
Spectre: me neither, thats why I keep my position to myself.
Celestia worshipping freaks?
"thay worship this god called....mollestia"
Vivix, :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrJHO_FxCU
d3rb, XD
Spectre: most of the times simply stating ones position is enough to create a shitstorm
d3rb: Nah. Celestia is god. Molestia can be like...
iunno
08,01i want to do it in a "like it's playing it straight" Spinal Tap style
http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29100000/scootaloo-and-rainbow-dash-rainbowdash-29126204-1280-800.png and now this is canon
something
mollestia is satan
nah
NMM
Instead of fighting over religion, let's fight over Slenderman. I think Slenderman is not real, I will now allow the opposition to rebut.
is the fox kid demon a female or male
08,01so just have it compeltely ridiculous, but almost believable
but he is real. i win
wait.... so we're not a cult?
we are now
should i serve the kool aid now?
08,01like, altars to Luna and stuff
what is the definition of a cult anyways?
Alchemist I can agree on that one I mean I actually tend to get really offended easily but I don't feel like going through another religious shitty fight
08,01Vivix: i'm gonna write up a script in the spring; hopefully start filming in the summer
Slenderman is not real because it was made up by some ancient people around 1600, as a story
That would be cool, especially the strange style of Spinal Tap
SlenderMan was made up on the itnernet in 2007 ish
but this goes to 11
some of those bible thumpers are the same parasprite soccermoms who complained about derpy
where the scariest thing they know
is called slender man
I'm more scared of "That drunk guy with a hammer"
Vivix See? There are so many stories about how religions started, and there are so many religions, thus there are many sides to the argument. That is why I despise argue over religion.
08,01though i only want to start writing once i've seen the final release version of brockhoff's BRONIES documentary
I was using Slenderman as a metaphor
I think I know where I've seen this youtube vid. It was a video of a dramatic reading of a sonic clopfic :D
Akai~~?
08,01because... well, it's gonna lampoon it a bit
but noone was arguing- and the conversation moved on
Religions carry interesting stories, just like the story of Slenderman, but it is nothing to argue over.
http://rainbowdash.net/file/rainbowdashsboyfriend-20120412T230439-zsahcsw.png
Also, I got 8 notes. :D
actually......no resist! must resist urge to argue
I never played it
just love this picture

Yes, and if you follow the 1 commandment set by the flying spaghetti monster, you go to heaven, with stripper factories and chocolate fountains. :)
fuck yeah, brb converting
lol
Strippers? No, clothes are sexier
Vivix NO CLOTHES IS A SIN
Screw sin! I want clothes!
YOU WILL NOW BE STONED TO DEATH
with spaghetti
yaay~~?
/me noms on the spaghetti .-.
striping implies clothes to start with
I love fashion-
Well i'd better get some sleep so a night everypony
Goodnight Moopy
so, honestly, beautiful clothes > stripping
may his noodly apendage touch you
Goodnight Moopy :P
d3rb unless its the grimdark/bizarre type of stripping

poor Pony--
In Australia, only the old folks believe in religion. I never knew that religion existed until 8th grade.
:D wow really
KrazyNoobs, .-.
Lies.
I had great grades in religious studies
but I had no idea people believed in it-
Vivix same
Vivix I was shocked to hear that modern day people in mainstream society believed in supernaturability.
08,01religion is the cancer that's killing /b/
08,01er
08,01, i mean
08,01bacon.
Well, I was never shocked by it once I learned it
Mmm bacon
No not the bacon D:

/me comes back crying
wow, you lasted a whole 2 seconds, good effort
/me places a cookie on KrazyNoobs' head
/me eats it
In fact, a few years a go I wanted to be religious, just to see what it felt like, but once you don't believe, believing was almost impossible
^
/me huggles Adam, the meat eating duck
now brb, darlings! Food-time
/me licks Vivix :P
Yeah, belief isn't something you just force into being. It has to just simply happen. =/
mrreep
yeah~~
/me runs
/me boops Gold_Demona's nose :3
Dat's mah nose!~ :D
yeah, you can believe god created the big bang-
This fireplace needs some music to go with it
a lot of great scientists and great sciences were from the church
now, really, brb :3
Maybe this goes well :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS9SUmAyKWM
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nevnq7MvVTI i see your music and rasie ya
Vivix yeah, like Gallileo. He was cooked on a rotisary by the church for discovering aspects of space.
I just looked it up, and found out that he was asked to stop, and he stopped, and was not executed. Sorry.
/me sighs
I should have FACTS before I say something.
lol
Relgion talk on BronyState always makes me depressed for some reason
at least you admit youer mistake and learnt
Are we really doing this guys? You do know these things usually dont end well...
Me too AdamTheDuck
Yeah, let's stop. This is stupid
How about them ponies, huh? :D
i have a point to make but it will only fuel the fire :<
If it is just a bunch of athiests talking, there will be no bad ending, just us talking about stuff.
Gold_Demona, eww ponies >_>
too bad we still have about 4 hours till we can talk about yesterday's episode.
Colourful adoescent equine are so homosexual <_<
Before we continue, are there any religious folk here today?
adolescent*
Just want to apologise
KrazyNoobs, to a degree.
i love that fire
/me hugs Spectre
AdamTheDuck which religion?
I have a very mild religious belief, but nothing solid.
Catholocism.
Cool, it is good to have a mix of people today.
I believe there is a God, but that's about the extent of my religious belief.
Catholicism*
Pfft, I've dragged too far away from my faith
I just question it for time to time.
08,01i believe that i would quite like a bacon butty right about now
from*
I am a non-believer, meaning I only believe in physical entities.
/me hugs d3rb back
08,01and lo', the frying pan, it doth provide.
KrazyNoobs: You mean you don't believe in dreams? D:
hey guys
Gyrobowl is our only god here.
Ohai alexxm
Dreams are created by the mind, Gold_Demona, just like thoughts.
AdamTheDuck, it only takes one comment and its on again
08,01AdamTheDuck: aren't you offending your own religious beliefs by saying that?
how've you been AdamTheDuck
hey alexxm
sup d3rb
08,01i thought "no god but me" and "no brazen idols" were in your scripture
08,01:P
I believe in dolan.
I cant hold it in, sorry: I am so looking forward to the BGM version of the last episode :3 That is all.
..........I thought we were done talking about this shit?
gooby pls is my religion
08,01"not even for a joke, you bastard"
Spectre: ikr? :P
08,01i'm sure that's somewhere in the commandments
that kick was worth it
alexxm, oh I've been fine, although I'm starting to get a little depressed from all this talk.
00,02"thou shalt not worship the gyrobowl"
Smooze is the only God I need.
what talk AdamTheDuck?
I am athiest, I only believe what is real.
alexxm, relgion talk.
yeah smooze i can really get behind that idea
http://derpy.me/68qHD
pony_3045 lol
Alchemist, :D irl lols
i did it
08,01Spectre: no, i was talking to AdamTheDuck
This is quite nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM3g2SXSa14
go home Phase4 your frunk
Alright
08,01Spectre: do you have a favourite bible passage?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/scootaloo-is-not-rainbow-dashs-sister.html
lol
in 2011
what you can say now?
eqd
I don't believe in religion, I just believe in science and reality. I can respect religion-believers, as they do nothing harmful.
08,01Spectre: no, favourite verse
08,01AdamTheDuck: not so much
Rainbow is just a role model pony_3045
brb, feeding my fish
08,01fair enough
KrazyNoobs, err i disagree with the last opart of your statement
08,01i have a favourite bible verse
d3rb_: I thought that was obvious. that they are not related.
08,01but i don't think you'd like it
d3rb_ 9/11
Even though I never read the old testament all the way through
if that was all it was respoinsible for i would be more ok with it
08,01AdamTheDuck: Ezekial 23:20
lol
eh i haven't actually read the bible
isn't it 25:17?
Alchemist, oh no, I think that one is right :$
yeah
08,01Spectre: i read Genesis, and as a big sci-fi fan, it made most sense to me when i read it as if it was speculatively talking about an advanced alien race
I read it to see what the hype was about, I read verse 1 Chapter 1 in Genesis: God said let there be light, and there was light. I laughed
08,01Alchemist: no, not that
and put the book down
Who here likes religious paradoxes?
Okay I read that...
They are fascinating
I think that's enough Bible bashing KrazyNoobs.
i like nonstampcollector
08,01but i do have a favourite book of the bible, in all seriousness
08,01song of songs is beautiful
08,01if you want to read somethign wonderful, read that
KrazyNoobs I'd hope not
you are boarderline runde imo KrazyNoobs , unintentional maybe but still
I am RUDE!?
nonononno
no
NO
08,01KrazyNoobs: enhance your calm, please.
I am not being rude, if you want me to stop discussing religion, I shall.
08,01KrazyNoobs: in all fairness, you were being rude
Oh, sorry
KrazyNoobs: we did, many times.
Let us just all stop, please.
Yes please before I get more offened thanks
sorry KrazyNoobs
chat working?
Yeah, just silent now.
lets discuss this instead http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUv-Q6EgEF
Sorry, I just don't understand religious people, I didn't know the borderline on what was rude and what was not. I thought what I was saying was okay, but if it is offensive, I learned something from relisious people. Thanks! and bye, I don't want to witness the flamewar.
And I apologise sincerely
Alchemist, dead link
Bye everypony
Bye KrazyNoobs.
later kra

11,02...I also like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy >>;
08,01my favouite book is Stranger in a Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein
11,02The Chronicles of Narnia was good too o.o
08,01SuperBrony64: have you ever read Dune?
my favorite book is watchmen
11,02No :<
11,02If people read The Magician's Nephew, they would understand so much more about the Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.
Lord of the Flies is my favourite novel :3
Welcome back KrazyNoobs.
wb KrazyNoobs
Oh, hey. I felt bad. about what i said
Let's move on.
11,02The Magician's Nephew goes over how Narnia began and how everything came to be.
SuperBrony64, is that the one with the tree?
Nice to know that conversation is done
%
Now we are talking about narnia. Seems legit
moo
Moo
11,02moo :D

SuperBrony64, ahh, it has been too long since I read that, can't remember anything that happened :$
/me needs an adult
SuperBrony64 goto bread
Never seen/read Narnia
KrazyNoobs i am an adult

dayum
I want to read more, but for soem reason I've grown to prefer online fiction, less purple- more variation
11,02AdamTheDuck: I remember it :3
annnd chat dies.
/me 08,01has read The Magician's Nephew, but none of the othe rbooks
Apparently, the g-k company didn't know about the brony community until they got hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube and lots of comments.
08,01i'm not a big fan of fantasy
ai need an adult...
I like fantasy, quite a bit, but I prefer it to be about... eh
maybe they will make guk ponies :D
11,02Though they might do it as a 'Find out now how Narnia began~"
I learned this by talking to them. They have facebook page, and I have been chatting with them for these past 2 days.
KrazyNoobs really what was their reaction
08,01with bruce willis
08,01and jet li
and a love interest
They were surprised that a bunch of men liked "a show for little girls", but I told them more about our community. They haven't replied yet
and explosions
^
and random sex scenes
Always with the explosions.
"I hate you evil queen!" *makes love*
So if GAK knows anything about our community, thank me.

RoboGerbil, if you've gone on 1 or more dates and are actually making an effort to put yourself out there your doing alot better than so many people
If someone says the magic word, I do it. That word is YOLO, but here, it is okay to say it, I don't want to mess up this place. It is pretty tidy, and I love it that way.
I only do that on other IRC chats
Don't do it to any chats
You obviously love Octavia?
it's an asshole thing to do

Okay, so I'm not crazy :3

Why?
CosmicLatte: No worries, I'm joking :P
Am I not allowed to link videos?
If it's a video, make sure to PM it. :)
Oh, you're joking?
Okay, good

CosmicLatte you say the name list on the left you find the guys name and double click on it
It's super evil, but funny.

I generally lurk in bronystate when I'm on my phone though, as I can't easily see stream and chat, and I can't keep up on my phone keyboard. Hope that explains, Socks. And hi Everlasting_Joy and scout19_tf2
It'd be so awesome!

Oh pinkie :D
DerpyMuffins, and yet if the Alicorns have the magic of the unicorns and the flight of the pegasi, surely they should have the strength of the earth ponies.
GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!!!:[
and Pinkie is seceretly plotting to kill everyone.

Pegasusususususes
Ponies are starving, put pudding on head :D
SATIRE!
Cypresswolf: I thought only alicorns could...
Kandarihu: maybe alicorns arent as good at magic and flying as unicorns and pegasi
freaky magic!
weather speel
Except they clearly are as good.
dat crown
Well, I don't think they're quite as FAST as some other pegasi
I have to admit, I have a huge crush on ponies. Im in love
Youtube comments in a nutshell?
windigoes
The crown looks better that way round
AJIsAwesome: You beat me to it.
do we ever show any g2 or g3
Everlasting_Joy: You were going to say that? :D
SafariMonkey: since this is before the rule of Celestia/Luna, methinks both royal sisters learned it from the unicorn tribe
But they're definitely just as good at flying as the average pegasus and better at magic than the average unicorn, from what we see
^
AJIsAwesome: Yep! It's funny because it's true.
hey
djxana if someone asks for ponies
I dont know....Pony history is full of holes
Sparta!
pony85086, as nice as a nerf sounds, Celestia and Luna by themselves are able to perform the same feat that the entire unicorn race used to do.
lol
night guys
Night, Alex.
hola pony_115638
I hate rainbowdash for some reason
Night, alexxm|colt. :)
Night alexxm|colt :)
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP Online: Sprites Released
The first time I saw this episode, I saw the winter spirits and I thought ":O horses there are no horses in this... show... wait... one...."
CosmicLatte: well we've only seen royal alicorns so far
Night alexxm|colt!
lag
i like spike
Spike is best pony!
yes
Yeah, but I take Cadence to be closer to 'average' alicorn (if there is such a thing) than the princesses.
nein
hes not a pony
ouch pinkey
pinky isnt very good either
can think outside the box, thinks inside a box chiminey
pony_115638: ... that's the joke :P
dat acting
I also have a theory that alicorns are just sort of a randomly occurring mutation and they're just exalted when they happen
That bow is adorable on Pinkie.
Oh, AJ. :D
djxana, that's the one with the balloon song, right?
Due to the appearance of that one unicorn we saw, the assistant lady with the long horn and tall legs
AJIsAwesome: you act like her atm
/me drinks pop
I wonder how this will end >_>
Im dissapointed that we diddnt get a new intro for season 3
being sillieh and all :2
:3&
I figure she's close to alicorn but didn't get the wings.
eh, close enough'
minty is kinda like a combo of pinkey pie mashed with derpy
CosmicLatte: I'm not onr to make theories, but I could see Alicorns as unicorns/pegasi earning the ability to become them.
I love RD in this scene :D
*BURP*
Cypresswolf: or it was all 'natural' until Celestia and Luna came and learned to do it by adapting their normal magic
*one
i think so
video streams
stream
your highness, its just bronystate stream
D:
I just think it's sort of like how the Cakes have a pegasus and a unicorn baby
I hope we get more lore episodes in the series. :)
rarity must be amazed at seeing ponies on stream
rarity hates bs stream
05back with an entire plate of ncaho salsa and chorizos
:D twilight_sprinkle
Wrek: NIce. :O
twilight_sprinkle: :D
chorizos?
Twilight has been the most ridden pony in the show
Wrek: You're set for the night :).
I think there's just an occasional chance of a baby that's both unicorn and pegasus, and they're skinnier due to the other accompanying genetic mutations
chorizo? meat right?
Pinkie was best suited for this role
can't fault her logic
you can actually
up and down depends on choice of axis
Rewind, back it up
Applejack tends to be more logical than Twilight
thelonepony: Spicy pork sausage.
Applejack's brand of logic is just more practical
CosmicLatte: She's seen as the most down to earth pony of the Mane 6.
plus twilight is more ocd
twilight is CDO
THAT'S NOT A RUBY, RARITY.
AJIsAwesome: ah, yeah that, forgetton about how it tasted like
CosmicLatte: they both seem logical, sometimes both of them arent
that reminds me, Mark summers is the best game show host of all time
All time? ALL time?
on double dare
i mean
dat EARTH!!!

twilight is best pony
Princess Platinum (Rarity) is best pony
/me brohoofs Bronysith
Pinkie's first reaction to seeing snow is to throw it. Second reaction is to ask where it came from.
the doctor brought those horse thingies to Equestria
inb4 GET ON WITH IT
And they say you can't run from your problems.
RD is best pony
GET ON WITH IT
what that shoeshine?
deal with it

It's upside down

So, Starswirl the Bearded dates back to shortly before the founding of Equestria.
It's why I love her :)
Twilight fakes glowy eyes for a stage performance
Wrek: who gives a fuck? it tastes awesome
So the windigos are the opposites of chrysalis? feeding on hatred?
my harddrive definately died at the wrong day. this damn netbook is too slow even for streaming
friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are better

otakon: Huh, then that's pretty dark
.
Ponies? ON A WREK STREAM? Impossiburu.

If the ponies who were fighting each other attracted the Windigos, and then moved on to a new homeland where they lived in peace, wouldn't their old homeland be potentially livable again?

LadyCanary: What do you mean?
And bow
this song needs an extension sooooo bad
btw LETS ALL SING
And here's one of my favorite songs in this series.
where the hell did they get the idea for the two queen forses on the flag?
And that's how Pinkie Pie got her cutie mark
05poor Dark_Horst :C
I want to have my school choir do this song..
otakon: Shush.
trolestia wasnt there
08,01what i'm essentially asking
08,01*sunglasses*
One of the best songs in the entire show :)
since when is lyra canary?
08,01is who wears the trousers in your relationship?
08,01yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah
...Excuse me?
I wish an extended of this song would be released.
Agreed, Socks.
Buytoast, obviously the current Equestrian flag that did not exist back then.
But what the heck does Lyra have to do with it?
Im so confused.....
Well my day was crap. :S
Smile Smile Smile just beats it in my book.
LadyCanary: she wears pants
?
HAI
08,01Socks: best song
Smile Smile Smile gets stuck in my head all the time.
the only good song is the cider song
Hi, SkaPunkBrony.

any other is inferior
gonna go afk for a bit
hey SkaPunkBrony
The Cider song gets stuck in my head, too.
05ever had a 2x200gram hamburger?

08,01spiders spiders spiders spiders
Wrek, I had a 1/2 burger
...Once again Wrek, HOW ARE YOU ALIVE.
;)good ep
Cheeseburger
could go for a big juicy burger right now
The thing about SSS is that you can sing it anytime and cheer anyone up. They don't need to be bronies or pegasisters, they just need to be breathing :)
my day sucked
08,01Wrek: pah, that's nothing. i once made a single burger out of 750g of mince.
05they are yummy
All right, I must take off.
05http://i.imgur.com/kdy5R.jpg
I think Smilex3, Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000, and the theme are the only pony songs that get stuck in my head all the time.
08,01it was delicious.
Wrek: awesomeness
Cider because it's totally a showtune
FRIES
that looks scrumptious
Babs Seed is pretty good as well :)

Ryunosuke: We don't NEED one, but we'd like one.
LadyCanary: it's the clearest pic I coulf find...
MLPFiW is awesome.
It's not that.

/me pats Wrek on the back. There there, sweetie.
Wrek: what program are you using that can tilt video that lilke?
I kinda wanna watch the whole episode upside-down..

I sometimes flip episodes of MLP to make them seem fresh :P
TEAM F.A.T

Codename: Kids Next Door

FiW?
:3 Applejack is tired of *dirty words* Dragons in her *dirty words* Equestria!
Socks: friendship is witchcraft
Friendship is walnuts.
scout19_tf2: They're the ELEMENTS OF HARMONY. I'm pretty sure they can take care of this.
<--- Wrekovision?
flat as in perpendicular to the screen i mean
dafaq 6_9
I think I like the FiW version too.
god the VAs for that series suck
But can we turn it upside-down again? I liked that.
Full episode?
still better than dusks dawn though >.>
I remember when I was trying to watch an episode of Dexter's Laboratory on a TV that was effectively broken, with all of it's scanlines condensed into a single line in the middle of the screen. There was a scene of Dee Dee running back and forth across the screen and all I saw was a pink dot moving across the remaining line of a screen back and forth. It was funny.
MLP: FiM in SPECTACULAR WREK-O-VISION!
itd be neat if this had g-minor mode
AJIsAwsome: id just like to no wut celestia is doin at times like this
twilight_sprinkle: :D
Wrek: having fun?
what the 6_9
Anyone else see the right side of the screen glitching?
Awwww
Wrek having fun
da hell
G-Major, you mean?
Drew, I see it.
hmm
So do I

scout19_tf2: That's understandable.
Wrek: Have you stopped using Wrek? =<

It's the sort of thing I'm into :P
dammit all I can hear is the FIW version :D
^
Haku1013: hia
Mmm, I like this more than the FiW dub.
Element of...... (Loyalty)
The FiW version of Sisterhooves Social is the BEST.
yeah, ytps and fiw have ruined half mlp for me
BUY SOME APPLES!
Kandarihu: I assume it was a CRT with a broken vertical deflector plate system?
friendship is witchract is decent, but it gets way too much love
twilight_sprinkle: That's why I stopped watching ytps of this show. It kills it for me.
one day im going to dress up as luna and go to the mall
well it IS a steep thing
go to the moon*
SafariMonkey, I guess so. It was a second hand TV that used to belong to a hotel.
I superglued my wings shut :c
The race has begun we must run fast jumpyou fell in the mud we can still win this
Wrek?
actually fiw is downright brilliant, the humor is very clever and it has its own story
05i cant wait for the MLP amnesia mod is done
O_O
The water makes me feel funnnnyyyyy
Wat.
...
hmm?
MLP amnesia...
oh gods
Excuse you, Fluttershy.
Applejack is more loyal than Raibow
There's a new episode of Friendship is Witchcraft coming out this month.
There is!?!
Wrek, I asked you a question
Wrek: Stopped using DP?
hey, ponies are in about every game
Ooh, are we coming up on the ABBAlanche?
Remember kids, only you can stop forest fires
Wrek: only way to play amnesia, "doors shut, lights off, surround sound headphones"
05huh?

Kandarihu: May I ask what episode it's paroding?
SkaPunkBrony, they're all young adults by pony standards.
How does rarity lose tic tac toe?
AJIsAwesome, no idea.

Wrek, Can you send me a link to your wallpaper please?

AJIsAwsome: itd be hilarious if in one ep the main 6 faced there bigest challenge ever and it shows celestia just righting a bunch of letters to them to do her shit while shes just sittin back eating a sanvich
Wrek: you'll be fine
NO WREK ;^;
Not a lemon tree, just a single lemon
Wrek: you're not Harold

AJIsAwesome: What did you say?
LadyCanary, that sounds like a ping that I'd never want to trigger
Oh god that scene..
Fluttershy's so strong
Haku1013: You do know they're the ELEMENTS of HARMONY, right?
I want to be a potato
BroPony|MEDIC: yesh
spypengen: I AM A POTATO!
The dragon is my father :c
scout19_tf2: oh :P, cause its true

The fact that theyre the elements of harmony only mean that they SHOULDNT be sent!
That's what alcohol does to you, Wrek.
cough cough coug
What if the dragon EATS THEM?!
no
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY
oh ok
lol, FiW
Then they get new elements
Haku1013: then the show's over
Exactly
so what is this pony marathon?
Haku1013: The dragon's sleeping. I doubt he'd want to kill them. He just wants to sleep.
legendary facehoof
heh;)
This episode has so much plot.. >.<
dragoness is recessive
Get it together, Shy
Hahahahaha
AJIsAwesome: but what about his mid century snack?
Fluttershy is so me :)
Oh fluttershy...
:'(
no fluttershy :'(
Fluttershy is yo momma... oooooooooooooooo
fluttershy is worst pony
A complete and utter wuss
No
:[
AJIsAwesome he tries to kill them because they wake him up a bit violently. Whose to say he wouldnt do that with anyother pony? Against a GIANT FIREBREATHING MONSTER you should send SOMETHING ELSE OF EQUIVALENT STRENGTH
Sith. Dont be startin.
Bronysith: -_-
Bronysith: YER MUM'S A SLAG!
13canary canary ~<3
ill have da soldier have a lil talk with fluttershy;)
/me 13is less cold now
otakon: oi you startin something?
Dragon: idgaf nigga!
Fluttershy is the moderate pony
Shizu Shizu :3 YAAAAAAAAY
evening Shizuka how are you today?
:O
Bronysith: Stop Startin'!
Bronysith well thats like, your opinion man. And Ill tolerate the FUCK out of you
otakon: im not startin you are
13otakon: http://i.minus.com/iYftHlbE2ZnQM.jpg
Bronysith: Start Stoppin' there Bronysith.
/me lloves and tolerates Bronysith's opinion
Shizuka: that.is.AWESOME!
I wish we had snow here
otakon: dont me startin with me, im the fookin japanese military
13not when you're plowing it isn't
/me lloves and tolerates Bronysith's OPINION
Now what?... We seduce him
dat plot
Shizuka: bah been there, done that.
Lol..
......
.....
Don't be a whorse
13blowing snow, cheap snowblower that dies every pass down the driveway, no hat
rarity has awesome plot
/me hasn't told his mom hostess wen bankrupt yet....
i love how little consitency this show has XD
Shizuka: at least you aren't shoveling it by hand, how big is your driveway?
do ya at least have a scarf?
I was this close to seducing him!
haha
Bronysith: it's fairly consistent
lol
oh rarity
13long
AJIsAwesome they beat the alicorn WITH ANCIENT RELICS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE. If youre going to send the 6 greatest Pony heros, at least send them with the stuff they NEED that makes them great heroes
yea pinkys got dis
Shizuka: id shovel your driveway for a fair price
and then he doesn't
He says unicorn or pegasi only.. as usual.
lol
I don't know who you are, If you're looking for fucks to give I'm afraid I don't have any, what I do have is a particular set of skills, the ability to hug and bake cupcakes, now I will find you, and I will LOVE AND TOLERATE THE FUCK OUT OF YOU!
I saw somepony at CG cosplaying at this certain pinkie
rarity is such a gold digger
Haku1013, violence is something that should be saved for a last resort. If he can be peacefully convinced to leave, violence can be avoided.
Pinkie...
as*
Why Pinkie
Socks: lol
haha
13at least we have a snowblower now
pfft
13the first seven years i had to shovel
Oh yeas, rainbow
13alone
Yes
D:
yyesss
Kandaihu I can respect that
RDs got dis mow
taste the painbow
Haku1013: Seeing how they were able to convince him to leave at the end of this episode, I doubt that they'd need any other form of assistance.
One day I will finalise that speech
Whatever Pibkie does is be a screwball
strike!
*now
Shizuka: eeyup I know that feeling. I bet it wasn't easy for ya.
STRIKE!
13with two feet of snow and road plow slush at the end that freezes as winter drags on
Pinkie
ahahahahahah
Mane 6 are best bowling pins
SHIT JUST GOT REAL
21st is the beginning of winter
Move near me. It never snows.
and then Fluttershy HULKS OUT!
how dare u
oooooo
FUS RO DAH
Speech 100
Haku1013, and as you can see, Rainbow Dash is convinced that peaceful methods are no longer effective, so she tries force.
YOU DO NOT HURT MY FRIENDS...
AlienWarhead: kill yourself
AJIsAwesome but thats just it, They DIDNT convince him. Fluttershy was FORCED to stand up to him.
And so Fluttershy was just hiding behind a rock the whole time. WHAT LUCK!
this is sparta
Never make Fluttershy mad, she'll talk your ass into oblivion.
lol
Yes, Ms. Shy....
I was just testing your love
he got told
Well, I never expected to see ponies on stream.
and RD is like "Hells yeah!"
/me plays and commit sudoku
RD is like "Yeah I did!"
Suddenly Momma Mode Fluttershy
otakon: cause fluttershy and rainbow dash are the worst
Commit sudoku..?
Fluttershy makes good mother
Polydunami: Thats what i was thinkinh
How do you commit sudoku?
Z snap
Bronysith: LIES
poor dragon:'( :'( :'(
And now Fluttershy takes a hybrid approach.
WUT
CosmicLatte: 1-9 in a 9x9x9 grid
Haku1013: Technically, she wasn't forced to. She decided to stand up for herself and her friends on her own since she saw them injured.
CosmicLatte I think Sudoku is that one japanese thing where you uct yourself open with a sword
er hold one
"Don't make me call your mother young man!"
Get outta here, you
Seppuku is ritualistic suicide
Haku1013: I joking about the puzzle
otakon: i thought that was haru kiri
sUDOku is a number game. sEPPUku is ritual suicide.
Haku1013: no Sudoku is the numbers game
derpy!
Bitch bunny. :|

dragon dragon dragon dragon...dragon
/me always thought seppuku was spelt with a b
fuq
AlienWarhead: also that as well
lol
AJIsAwesome Forced or not, she only did it because her friends fucked up. \
Hara-kiri is another name but it's the gringo version.
brb
Fluttershy saves Equestria
dat plot
Bronysith: That's the dishonorable version
Dude
Rawwr
like suicide is honorable
bullshit
stupid bunny stahp jumping
dat pinkie
That's not even funny, dude, she was about to win the record..
dat arrogance
Goat.
WUT
lol
HEY
Bronysith: Weird samurai thing
O.o
Now what, Wrek?
Wheeee
am i drunk
Oh fluttershy :)
XD lol
AlienWarhead: the only time suicide is honorable is if it is sacrifice
Or maybe I'm dreaming?
CREDITFLIP!
Wrek: what program does that?
You can faint now, Fluttershy
Wrek I think the lemon is REALLY going to your head.
You spin me right round, like a record baby!
:D
I oughta be screaming! It's just that EVERYTHING TODAY IS THOROUGHLY
Just like that.. without any warning
Rainbow Dash is certainly higher on my list of favourite ponies after yesterday
At two in the morning

Where da ponies at
I LOVE THIS SONG
spent most of mine looking for something for my Dad's birthday tuesday
<--- Swedish Metal. <3
twilight_sprinkle: GEE, how did you guess? I mean, I like it too, but that version had more bounce and fun to it.
The last song that played that is.
LadyCanary: peple are allowed to like things that you dont, you know.he only aid he liked it better, he didnt say it was better
I mean, to each their own, but if the person is saying it just because OMG VOCALOIDS SO COOL HUR DURR.
I am reminded of the 70s.
Then you are a biased motherfucker. twilight_sprinkle, I KNOW that.
LadyCanary: Erm, Levan Polka is from Finland?
liek this if you cri evertime
Vordox: I know I know!

/me sighs

twilight_sprinkle: STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH
I thought about old guns, but those are expensive - but I'm leaning on getting something for his gun room
DID I SAY THAT
SO AWESOME SONG
Calm down, please.
LadyCanary: Chill the fuck out.
Oh dear
Hey. Be nice.
oh dear
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355100695676.png never change, google captions
LadyCanary: it was somewhat of a joke/sarcasm

Hello, Rex.
No. It wasnt. Because if it WAS, then I would know.
Get a musket!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Daring Do Adventures: Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone
This is a neat song
Someponys overly sure of herself
LadyCanary: my point is, you need to stop facedesking and treating people like retards any time they say something you think isnt very smart
I like it, too.
twilight_sprinkle: Oh... well personally I have never heard the vocaloid version of levan polka but you know
...
deborah-blandon:D
all 4chan links look like 4chan.org.jpg :S

HAH
I think that if this discussion is to continue it should do so in a calm, inoffensive, and orderly fashion.
FRom Bloodbound to Bloodbound :D
thats better
At least Vocaloid is better than Glee.
twilight_sprinkle: You can stop white knighting now.
When did that happen?
I don't like
LadyCanary: chill
LadyCanary: ah yes, the classical "get off your high horse and stop telling me to be nice" card
Stay nice.
...
LadyCanary: Maybe you need to turn away from the computer and take a break. Have a cup of tea or a cigarette.
the hell is a vocaliod
aint it vacroo?
i think it is vocaroo
/me 13stuffs a muffin in canary canary's mouth<3
but i wouldnt really know, its just what i usually hear
twilight_sprinkle: the part where you stop talking, this is that part
Vocaloid is voice synthesizers
SpeccyRush: no thx im good
Does anyone have any results for next week's movie night?
applejack not rarity butterfly
synthesizer? like that auto tune thing?
hi
djxana: Yeah I dont really see why people like Transformers so much.
synthezier is like an electrical piano
RosePetal: I know it was going to be George the Hedgehog and then they rereolled because that was too crude or something
What happened to this chat lately?
*kidnaps twilight_sprinkle*
I don't remember what the others were.
I guess sort of, not exactly
Rex_Mundi: D: where are you taking me?
i know we get mars attacks! next week
I mean it's robots...
haven't seen that since i was younger
Ah, yeah, that was the other one.
sayin a buncha cliche crap
Not really interesting.
*twilight_sprinkle, to the princesses dungeon
gdlk_work: yup owo
Rex_Mundi: sounds nice so far
then i clicked on this day aria in related vids and thats when i confirmed i was a brony i didnt reveal to all but my crush till second semester of college
Suprisingly good song
I like this song very much
twilight_sprinkle: yep, your roomates with Twilight Sparkle
I became a brony after seeing Secret of my Excess.
Rex_Mundi: sounds perfect
because Secret of My Excess was the first episode that I saw the name of on TvTropes
twilight_sprinkle: you're a prick :|
otakon: orly, how so
Otakon: What the fuck dude.
twilight_sprinkle: I saw what you did to Canary :| yer an ass
otakon: ahaha
Otakon: she was being a dumbass.
everyone chill
otakon: so first she insults a dude for liking vocaloid
TheGentleManBrony: no, I've been around this stie LONGER than you
twilight_sprinkle: what did she say?
GUYS.
otakon: then she calls me a biased motherfucker
no magic duel
CHILL.
otakon: then its MY fault?
Please.
Otakon: what the hell does that have to do with anything?
twilight_sprinkle: and it makes it better that YOU insult her back?
13OI
:'(
otakon: i DIDNT insult her
13SETTLE
i dunno what the hell is going on
TheGentleManBrony: dude, eerytime you post its something inflammatory, what the hell man?
CAN'T YOU SEE YOUR CONSTANT FIGHTING IS TEARING US ALL APAAAAART
Seems like we've acquired a bit of baggage here in this chat...
settle like a souffle
When do the Windigos arrive?
Any lottery results? There wasn't any shown on the main page.
Rex_Mundi if you were paying attention I was the one trying to be nice
otakon: all i said is she should be more tolerable of others peoples views, which were stated simply as "i like this version of the song" not even "this version is better"
hi shizu
twilight_sprinkle: the fact is you made her look like an ass and then suddenly it's her fault over something that REALLY shouldn't have mattered int he long run.
*puts a nifty hat on Polydunami*
why is everyone getting so butthurt?
Bonjour
isn't the A Gladiator or something?
yup
My G5 has taken one rage quit too many, what is a good mouse to get
then the first two episode of season 1 hooked me and that was the same day my mother descovered me watching it and asked me why i was watching a show for little girls and if i was gay
Oi, are you startin', mate?
Rex_Mundi I do actually say nice stuff on here.
otakon: it matters if she does it every time someone says she doesnt like
Rex Mundi: I'm not a total ass.
no she doesn't
twilight_sprinkle: tonight, recently she's facedesked but that's it
otakon: oh yeah? she even called me a biased motherfucker for defending someone who only said he likes vocaloid
is someone being a bitch or something?
no
Yes
Can we chill and talk about something that wont get people angry/ Like politics, R34, and comparisons of bronies to furries, and other safe topics.
but considering that everyone started getting her case about it
whos being a bitch TheGentleManBrony ?
So how's everyone's days?
LadyCanary was being a douche Vittania.
Rex_Mundi: What you did thar, I see it
twilight_sprinkle: and you start a LOT of stuff around here, hell remember that goddamn debate from a while back
Like straight up Jersey Shore style.
TheGentleManBrony: no she wasn't
Well, that's one against.
funny cause shes from jersey TheGentleManBrony
....Im not.
otakon: youre right i do, why should i sit back and watch someone being treated like an idiot for simply liking something?
Lady Canary is... a LADY.
...I DIDNT SAY THE PERSON WAS AN IDIOT.

Is everyone having a good day?
This sure was a great night to come back to Mane chat I see
twilight_sprinkle: I read what she wrote all she said was "I don't mind if you like it, but a lot just like it for the sake if it being popular" basically
Also, dude. You don't even know anyone in this chatroom. How can you be certain of your opinion on some of them?
RAWRity: Well, you know how it is.
/me hugs RAWRity
We can disapprove together :3
hello space coffee
twilight_sprinkle: and considering the extremely biased views you have on stuff I LIKE you're in NO GODDAMN PLACE TO JUDGE BIAS.
Harro :)
otakon: did you also read the part where she called me a biased motherfucked for defending the guy?
I was hoping for a better mood when I came to this chatroom, to be honest :P
....I DIDNT SAY HE WAS
I WAS EXAGGERATING
FOR GODS SAKE.
otakon honestly be quiet now
twilight_sprinkle: and you took it seriously?
Polydunami: If you pretend the angries are gone it's quite happy :)
Oy, I thought that was a joke, twilight_sprinkle
Ya'll motherfuckers need jesus
gdlk_work: Awww
RAWRity, that's probably not called for..
4 a.m.* lol
RAWRity:Giant Flying Spaghetti Monster FOR LIFE!
otakon: it sure felt seriously. and in any case, facedesking any time someone says something she doesnt agree with isnt polite either, and thats all i said frankly
for some odd reason i though a bit of the melody for the first few lyrics to find a pet kinda souded like a dream i dreamed
gdlk_work: Well at least you can go on here while at work
Seriously, screaming lazer-eyed Jesus painting needs to come in here and blast some fuckers into nonexistance.
13twilight_sprinkle: settle, drop it
Don't you fillies make me get out my Meanwhile impression.
Meanwhile makes me lol.
Meanwhile makes me moist
....
http://i.imgur.com/vC8kh.jpg otakon spaghetti monster?
twilight_sprinkle: dude, the point is... did the person she was commenting about act like they were offended?
13Okay seriously.
13Know when to drop it.
13You people drag things out way longer than they need to be.
I liked Princess Luna's appearance.
she was talking about me and i wasnt offended
of course you do
I'm done.
i accept what she said and i keep calm and canter on
Right then.
Im sorry.
THERE.
13quarries produce way too much cobble
Look at Wrek's awesome skills
WILL THAT PLEASE YOU.
Like just man this looks so awesome
With the water flowing and the rocks
yes ladycanary
i never wanted a fight, all i asked for is a wee bit more tolerance towards other opinions, im not asking for an apology, and the guy isnt offended either
And I have tolerance.
But lately, I have been pushed too far.
This is for twilight_sprinkle and LadyCanary
http://tinyurl.com/ajeq6rn
And the minimap, it still sorta reminds me of a chocobo
...
That was kind of funny, to be honest
Is this still SC2's map editor? It's....actually pretty nicely detailed
fair enough TheGentleManBrony
Someone was saying earlier it looked like a cat with a hole in its face..
Also, I thought we were moving on from this part
TheGentleManBrony: uncalled for
also i want to apologize for starting a fight, thats not what i wanted at all, neither do i enjoy it
These graphics are really good
I need a hug..........e stick to beat you with
gdlk_work: that was a post on reddit
Ooh, a fish

Well, Sleepless in Ponyville has a very healthy dose of footage that can be used for an Inception parody or two
Also, it has been 24 hours
otakon: these things adapt
oh COME ON!
don't you mean Sleepless in fan Panderingville?
Oh crap! I didn't notice, Wrek did you get ride of the black around "The Wrek Sessions" yet?
Polydunami: Remember those bloodshot eyes? Fuckin nightmare face man!
4,8loved the episode yesterday
Hey now, it's still a good episode.
so wuts dis?
welp
/me bites my tongue and ignores Buytoast
And dat kick.
A lot of people liked yesterday's episode a lot
of course they did
i think aji is one of the network mods
it had moon horse
The yellow it burns
nyeh
i like season 3 more than season 2 atm
yelloooow
I'm pretty sure aji is an admin
i loved next episode
season 2 was meh
05hm?
Buytoast: Are you getting angry because people like the thing you like?
Also there was a lot of wondering about whether Sweetie Belle's bad singing is a permanent thing or just a silly
Because we all thought singing was her special talent and so on
I did enjoy the episodes from season 2
Polydunami: naturally ;)
Yesterdays episode was very slice-of-lifeish. And thats a welcome break from the fast paced episodes that preceded it.
because people like the thing i like?
what?
I want to BuyToast
TheGentleManBrony: eh dont bother with him, hes the resident troll
Buytoast: I think he's implying you're a hipster.
I think.
Im going to a sushi buffet this week
Bronysith: him too ofc
Brb guys
Ok
i dunno what he's implying but that sentence confused me for a second there
Rex_Mundi: enjoy the half assed sushi
twilight_sprinkle: there are so many trolls in here >_<
?
you need to be more specifit XD
don't get sushi
get a burger
i'm visually impared i cant read the chat without having to turn up the mag on my mac
or some sweet potatoes
last night I got sucked into my TV and met a bear and took a huge piss is a weird room
even mashed potatoes would be good
Dusky: true dat, its still the internet so iguess its not surprising
sushi is good, but usually mediocre at a buffet >.>
Bronysith: I wouldn't know because I'm smart enough not to touch it.
jcelios: Sounds like Persona to me.
Yeah
It was just..
Awkward.
ding ding ding!
Thing about buffets are, people other than the chefs touched my food.
Bronysith: This place isnt so cheep though, so im going to enjoy some sushi and sashimi
jcelios: dat persona 4
^o^
^.^
I love my little Kanji figure :3
Wrek, that map's looking really awesome.
sushi is good untill you suddenly find huge worm in your head
LadyCanary: what an asshole, i hate that guy in arena
:|
the hell is a Kanji?
a huge worm*
Dontchu be talkin bout mah husbando Sith :|
I was at a Chinese buffet and the name of it was...like...Delicious Something...and it was AWFUL!
sounds like that guy from Johnny Quest
IT PISSES ME OFF THINKIN ABOUT IT!!!!
He's a character from Persona 4.
ah
/me takes a deep breath
The Kanji script is basically Chinese characters used in Japanese
When you speak Chinese it makes it a lot easier to know when you should leave a Chinese restaurant
LadyCanary: but kanji is annoying to fight against, one of the reasons hes banned in the fighters guild at my college XD
next time you go to a chinese buffet, get some crawfish
...LOLO WHAT
those things are delicious
HOW. Just....HOW.
Characters banned?
DAMN ADVERTISEMENT!
That's quite silly. I mean, he's not THAT rigged.
BROOKLYN PARK RAGE!
If you walk in and you hear the kitchen staff asking whether to throw some two-day-old fish away because it smells and the cook tells them no
You get up and politely leave.
Isn't that in the same vein as those blokes who insist on "no items, Fox only, Final Destination" stuff? :P
The perks of speaking Chinese are many indeed..
Buytoast, did you see blobfish there? I heard chinese eat them
Hey guys :)
Harro, Pony
LadyCanary: ill stick with protagonist
Yu ^_^
last time i was at a chinese buffet was quiet some time ago
Um, this is gonna seem super noobish of me, but how do I change my username? :3
but i dont recall any blobfish
Blech. I can't stand the guys who want to take the fun out of games.
pony_359628: Not at all. We all start somewhere. Type /nick and then the name you want.
CosmicLatte: What if they are speaking Shanghainese or Min Nan or Cantonese or Hainanese and you only know Mandarin?
could go for some seseme chicken though
LadyCanary: Thank you :3
LadyCanary: also, never get DCD to be your fighting game sensei, he is relentless
that shit's delicious
T~T
Did that work?
Well, obviously I wouldn't understand if they weren't speaking Mandarin..
I'd get quite confused
LadyCanary: i mean goddamn helpful, but relentless
"What? Eight tones? No :c"
Bronysith: I would like him to be :3
TwilightSonata: eeyup
Hey LadyCanary: I'm sorry if I came off as kind of a dick.
Awesome!
well, i think if it was in buffet you would remember this
Hey TwilightSonata, are you new to Bronystate?
Theres this cheep Chinese takeout place near me that is called 'Wok n' roll' because it also sells sushi. No way in hell im getting any sushi from such a place! Except for like California rolls or something that is barley sushi anyways...
Polydunami: Yeah, a friend told me about this place and it seemed pretty cool, so I decided to check it out ^_^
LadyCanary: he is incredibly aweosme, giving me guides and RIGORUOUS...training sessions to help me get better as Yu
Eep. I'd stay away.
Nice. Well, you're always welcome, TwilightSonata
:)
You know where I usually get my sushi at?
A JAPANESE RESTAURANT!
the sea
:OOOO
PLOTTWIST
No, you get chicken from the sea.
Scootaloos come in a can.
I dont trust sushi that isn't from a Japanese place
I thought that was buffalo.
TheGentleManBrony, lol
true
i've always wanted to try buffalo
Well, with buffalo in a can, you've gotta share.
gotta taste good to be hunted to near extinction
gdlk_work which part are you loling at?
derp i bought tostitos without dip
Aw man, you dont get the joke xD
Aw yeah Pip http://fav.me/d4y1ejc
...
pip
LadyCanary: Great White Buffalo
D'awwh <3
doesnt work as kamina...
he just doesnt
I would've taken him for Simon
I'm like the only one who doesn't like Pip aren't I -,-
People in hawaii and California get most of the good sushi restuants. You got to travel a bit if you want decent sushi in Massachusetts.
DAWNUKE http://fav.me/d5ms9cd
I get good sushi and, lijke Shizuka, I live in Minnesota.
TheGentleManBrony, well, here talking about chinise buffet and sushi and you just mention that sushi is japanese food, so it was kinda funny
Maui had some of the best fish I ever had - tried some raw fish, dont know what type - meat was a dark red while raw - deliscious
telapia is a good tasin fish
or however you spell it
My dad makes his own sushi :)
Tilapia?
/me explodes
Wait what
yeah
tastes good
Tilapia is delicous :3
too bad it's shitty for your health or something
raw fish is dangerous
:3 as long as you dont find out what talapia eat
CosmicLatte: Is your dad Japanese?
gdlk_work: most raw food is
Nope. He's just an amazing cook.
He can make anything you show him
I so want to go to hawaii one day, not just for the tropical weather, but also im interested in the History. King Kamehameha is known as the great for a reason. And i want to see one of those old hawaiian temples.
gdlk_work: so is raw egg, but that doesnt stop people from eating raw cookie dough and such
Give him something to try and he can tell you nearly every ingredient in it just by taste
And then he'll cook it twice as good
yeup... i like sushi then i eat it, but i'm trying not eat it to ofter
cookie dough is baws
:D
....Hawaiian temples?
It's not raw meat itself that's dangerous, but the pathogens that can be found on some meat products.
AW YEAH FINNTROLL IN THIS BITCH!
i mean you can eat rare meat...
would poppyseed dressing go well with chips tortilla chips to be exact
Hahaha..
Seriously Wrek?
Poppyseed dressing goes with everything.
some my friends always eating sushi and raw stuff and i think they're going to die sometimes
Seriously?
In moderation.
why is rare steak not that good...medium rare is better, and i dont understand how some can eat that shit raw
Tartare steak?
Wrek: Are u trying to be a dick?
Ok nevermind
its not a big deal
TheGentleManBrony: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiau
Guys. Be nice.
TheGentleManBrony: you better rephrase that XD
Meat is best well done and slightly crispy
when my family was in Maui visiting my uncle's family - Dad's brother - we had ourselves a BBQ - got quite a few wierd looks from the locals - few have ever seen BBQ done right on the island
Bronysith: I just said its not a big deal.
why is tonight the night of debate
because it's still the wekened
Because its sunday?
Hey Wreky, would you be ever so kind to play Raubtier or Fintroll later on?
TheGentleManBrony: noonono, what you said was "are you trying to be a dick" when you obviously meant to say "are you trying to make a dick?"
Everybody's working for the weekend~
.....
Loverboy!
okay then.
LadyCanary: that reminds me...i have finals to work on
fuck
GO.
I'm ignoring that.
GO YOUNG MAN AND STUDY.
..Yeah.. I really should actually be studying Mandarin..
:DDD AND YOU PLAYED ONE OF MY FAVORITES
Wreky <33
Since my final is Tuesday..
Mine is...soon. @_@
LadyCanary: oh shit, not till tuesday
One thing I loved was a burger....what was that called....Moco Loco? it was rice, beef and fried egg with yolk still runny - ^_^ That was wonderful - my siblings didnt like it much though
i almost had a heart attack
my parents moved out i'm 20 and they left a little bit of rasberry voldka and jack daniels is there any sauce i can make with jack daniels with or what would it be best on i cant believe i'm asking cooking advice on a mlp chatroom
Hm.
Stranger things have been asked.
Darnit! All this talk of food - ya'll just opened up a veritable pandora's box with me - :) I could talk your ear off with good tastin food :D I won't though, not tonight anyways
the only food you need is the stuff from Nick's Gyros
i have hamburger in the freezer tortilla chips i'm trying to create the ultimate nachos
boy watchin Wrek paint the ground reminds me of paintin a pinewood derby
pinewood derbys...the memories
Whooooh, just read an awesome fic..
And now I'm reading it again.
CosmicLatte: thats not possible
Because it's awesome.
It is possible.
I wish I could take you guys on a culinary experience - on all the local favs here in Cypress - most are discontinued now for many different reasons
Cypresswolf: human trafficking?
What I want, is authentic Mexican food. Stuff they eat in mexico and not Taco bell shit
i'm in eagle rank my pinewood derby car was a mini replica of takumi's ae86 gt apex trueno from initial d
shit, i almost won my region's championship pinewood derby thing
Uhh, don't you mean CYPRUS?
Wick's Bar used to have a chef that made the juiciest steaks - at least a pound each
i am so thankful for adblock
But still, im excited for sushi im going to get soon.
but in the end i didn't make it
Bronysith: :3 As long as you can stay hungry
Saying Taco Bell has real Mex. food is like saying Olive Garden has authentic Italian food, Rex_Mundi.
taco bell is not mexican Rex_Mundi
You mean to tell me that Mexican food isn't normally made out of sand, Canary? D:
Taco bell is everything.but.mexican
LadyCanary: True, i wasnt saying tacobell is mexican, i said i wanted real mexican and NOT tacobell
XD
Of course, Rex_Mundi.
hey, taco bell aint too bad
That shit aint got nothing against real tacos
but taco bell is good...not amazing, but i still eat that
their volcano tacos are pretty good
not nearly spicy enough
but good
i prefer the beefy five layer burrito
next months food project fast food lasagnia
Buytoast: Tacobell is the food chain that I refuse to eat from. The only taco bells that i ever enter are the ones that are also KFCs
cause i dont have to spend a fortune and i can fill up fast
shit, i ate about 30 volcano tacos after a concert once
Buytoast: thats alot of money
yeah, financially that was not my wisest decision
but it tasted good
Buytoast: How are you not dead.
dunno
I stopped eating at Taco Bell when it was determined that their meat only barely manages to meet the USDA requirements for being called "meat". >_>
So basically it's synthetic goo.
i'm just glad i didn't get anything on my tuxedo that night
i just enjoy the taste of the beefy 5 layer
otherwise i mighta died the next day
even though the beans could be better
like black beans and not fake refried >.>
Beans beans they're good for your heart :3
Black beans are SO GOOD.
my god, my professor responded in 5 seconds after i sent her an email LadyCanary
Be thankful you got a teacher like that.
i know
and i have to get new ones next semester
and shes the head of the gaming club....why cant i have more awesome professors like her?
Worse, Canary. Taco Bell meat literally contains sand in it. >_>
A sushi... burrito? What kind of abomination is this!? http://www.tofugu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sushi-burrito.jpg
...Wat
DIESELDODDEN
Wrekyyyyy
that don't look too scrumptious
and then canary was happy or sad, i really cant tell
They confirmed as much, way back when they got sued for their meat's quality. They state that their meat contains "seasonings" like "silicon dioxide", better known as sand.
>_>
speghetti tacos sound good tonight
djxana: icarly plz go
:D chat can't take my food talk - disconnected from server
Bronysith: don't worry, she'll leave
hell, one of the best wrapped things i've eaten are those ceaser wraps from the Wendy's dollar menu
hell
then again, anything on their dollar menu is pretty good
Oh man, I havent had a Frosty in such a long time.
i ate 50 chickfila chicken nuggets before
uhoh... now i'm hungry
And virtually boneless! - PO's Ostrich burger, gone as of last january - but they put a food challenge in its place - 5 lb burger - no one's finished it all yet
And if you want the best damn BBQ Houston has to offer - well, not IN Houston, just outside the limits - Carl's is THE place to be!
/me starving
...I think I tempted the chat enough - I think everyone just up and left, headed my way to take advantage of my offer :)
I miss Frosties.
dat split
Their Frosty floats were delicious, too.
Ever get food from those mobile taco trucks?
woah
....wat
fuck no
Burger joints are OK, its Taco Bell that I hate
;3; Wreky kicked me.
i didn't talk that much did I?
I thought Wendy's still had frosties... ?
Buytoast: it was a netsplit
bah
more fancy talk
those 50 nuggets were awesome
but Polydunami brings up a good point
They do.
i heard louisiana is where the best bbq
they still make frosties, right?
50 nuggets for 5 dollars
damn
Well, I live in Canada so, yeah.
them frosties are good stuff
Also, we still have twinkies
bah
twinkies are nasty
you can keep em
Most of them are quite good - my coworker got me hooked on paposa - its a flour tortilla bread with chicken and cheese inside, side of marinated cabbage - with some tangy vinegar - tastes great together
/me sniffs his ear
what about zingers
I kinda really want to try horse meat, witch is illegal in the USA for some reason.

Actually, in the fic, "Earth and Sky", the author addresses that fact. Diamond Tiara is beautiful, and the trophy wife of Prince Blueblood, who married her for her money and looks. She married him for the prestige and the chance to take over the company-- which for all intents she does. It's... not a happy marraige.
SpeccyRush: and leave THAT out of here.

So why on earth are they calling tech support?
the nostalga

to check if there was anything on the line that would be tracking the phone
"Hello, tech support? Yeah, can I get help tracking my wife's phone?"

tom is such a rebel
tom is aa troll
Wrek: The Cowboy Episode/Ice skating Episode? :D
lel
/me jumps ontop of gdlk_ouo coach hines style
more likely to get an intelligent answer if you call tech instead of billing on something like that
Still rather sad.
And a tad frightening.
/me sneaks up on Vordox
I loved Tom and Jeryy Kids.
and most of the time it's either soemthing installed on the phone itself, or 3rd party illegal stuff that we can't control anyways
one stupid dog:P
oh boy... this gonna be good
/me jumps on Vordox bak
/me doe sa piruette spin
WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE

The worst I've ever gotten was one woman who dropped her quarter - a bloody quarter, and it was her fault too for putting it on the cash where it would slide under the belt - and insisted that she had already paid me and that she shouldn't be required to look in her purse for another damn quarter.
Brony_ponies: We can't guarantee that these are aired. They just are. :)

Sup
Hi, SpadeKyurem[WoW]. :)
I really don't like how Blizzard handled the loot system for Pandaria, the whole coin thing is stupid
After Hammerfall can you play some power metal?
just asking.
hi SpadeKyurem[WoW] irony is that my friend is in another room playing WoW lol
Wreky, Sabaton? :3
/me go to fireplace
The problem with it I have is, you have to go through a ton of dailies to get 90 lesser, hand them in get 3 charms
You can only do this once a week btw and a max of 10
You can use it on a boss and have a 15% of getting any loot if you didnt get any with its death
the elder charms?
The problem with this is...you dont get what you want, most of the time you can get the same item you allready have, and 28 gold as a compensation is stupid
fluttershy D
:D
oh shit.
love this song
A bag for just gold? Give me some damn potions
:O Kick Start My Heart <3
Dat Motely Crue.
^
Though I am no big fan of that kind of metal.
full throttle with fluttershy
LadyCanary: i am lol
lol
I love Pandaria, dont get me wrong, the loot system is utter crap though
well duh
WAT
he got message in irc
HEY! I used to have that background
oh
it if didn't do that people would whine about their precious loot being stolen
steam
Buytoast: You know whats realy stupid?
dat DK
dis song
i used to have the luna and rainbow dah ones
3d ponies look not canon
a bit
gotta be better
Buytoast: You can have a max of 1000000 lesser charms
but only 10 elder charms
THE FUCK
Per4sonally, I don't mind the dailies, I'm not a big raider-- so far, and I like the sidebits. (And if you're talking the Sha, well, there's only two pieces you can get other than the boots anyhow--and some PVP stuff. I don't like PVP.)
yep
HOW DOES THAT HELP AT ALL
it doesn't
dat twins music
but as long as they have something like that to keep people occupied
they can keep milking that cash cow
:D
I'm fucking drowning in gold
I had so much gold I could aford a dark pheonix
cake!
and a golden king
so and get a brawler invitation from the black market
Im not that rich
spy sappin muh cake
that'll cost you about 20k
Still need to work on that
Not the cake! ;~;
hell, i got invited to it today
spycrab
and it's fun shit to watch people get killed because they think they can stand in shit and win
So can you invite for free technically? But everyone asks for gold?
you can only get an invite from someone who is rank 7
rarity
La noire music ftw!
Were invites given to random people or were they discovered via the drop?
but you can either buy one via bidding on the black market
not given
you had to get em from the market
And what are you talking about-- Brawler's Guild? Or what?
Or the horde/allie rares
or hope for the 2% drop from the new rares
GMod for comedy related videos, Source Filmmaker for more serious styled videos...
...You're welcome.
yes, the Brawler's Guild
Twilight has books for EVERY occaision, I see.
VenHur: SFM can be for Comedy, it's just not the best joice.
*choice
give me that spycrab
They really need to increase the gear chance in LFR, because its not worth the tedium going through all those raids and getting only gold
Buytoast: I'm not terribly interested in that either.
G-Mod is better for the obscene/absurd
dat Powerpuff ^_^
eh, it's not all that spcatacular
but it's good for wanting to show off
Dat Powerpuff Girls.
dat window
is there any majour fanfics for lps
plus you get to throw garbage at people fighting
dat start menu
so it's all good
Buytoast: Which I doubt my main could-- ilvl 449 at the moment. Working bit by bit on it, tho.
05i blame youtube
05i cant lock to the vid itself
You dont even get that much for it
probably not
just a pet and something else i think
even though most of the fights are just move out of shit, they still hit hard
boa fist weapon
or somethin
Eh,
derpy!
Derpy <3
Derpy!!
I spend more effort in putting together ridiculously scanty transmogs anyhow. It's known as Magastyle in my guild. Well, at least according to one guy.
Magastyle?
haha
the only thing i'd consider for transmorging are the challange mode gear pieces
After my main. Magahowl, Dalaran server.
because the shaman ones look kickass
giant ass shoulder totems about half the size of your body
I like the paladin one
Muffin!
Buytoast: Makes you look like blastoise
Muffin!
it's a trap!
not to mention the tier shaman stuff looks bad
the paladin armor looks nice
I still liek the judgement tier
I think thats what its called
Well time for me to hit the hay. Night all, and thank you for streaming Wreky <3

The two best items I find in Pandaria are the Gen-ji knife set and the cremation torch
lol Shizu-chan
what about the puntable marmot?
that too
They only let you kick it once now...
Shizuka~ <3
minecraft is a dangerous thing
it consumes
I may be exalted with the Tillers (and I am) but I'm not paying that much gold for a knife set that serves no real purpose.
and it knows know end
Kencolt: I had a shit ton of gold so I did it anyway
<3 :D
TO THE MOOOOOON!
Besides I like making people who fail mincemeat
:D
I... do now, SpadeKyurem[WoW] .
Do not.
i bought the knife set when i learned you can use it on team mates
Kencolt: You should be drowning in gold man
I easily get up to 1k at least in a week
Never have been. Just never have been.
Dude...
hell, i made 10k leveling my monk to 90
Ok. THAT was COOL.
i wish i could fly ;~;
Yup, she still got the touch...
Kencolt: Agreed. I thought that was very well done.
The HELL are they saying?
Buytoast: Hell I never got that much money untill Pandaria
So... Awesome... /)o3o(\
i had like 40k when i stopped playin in cataclysm
hell i was givin away 1-2k in lil rivia things in trade

The hell IS this?
something funny.
