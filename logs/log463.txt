pon-3?
Maybe they'll tell you about Hearth and Plow Day.
yes
I dunno.
ballad of the brony.
Bronyx135 was it ballad of the bronies?
yes
Bronyx135: obviously :D
I LOVE THAT
wat is this
Hearth's Warming Eve comes before Hearth and Plow Day.
uggh
.... Song name ... Can't remember.
stupid kick thing :(
any1 have a page that tells you about MLP news and stuff?
04Chicken
Ninjazz: pendulum
I am bored. Entertain me, fellow bronies.
like laurens blog or something
That's the group, silly."D
:D
check equestria daily
Ninjazz: joking
/me does nothing
Hearth and Plow Day celebrates and commemorates when homesteaders came to Ponyville and made their homes their,a nd sowed their crops.
And founded Ponyville.
wow
14veges
You're funny, Magical_pablez94. :P
DAFUQ...
i stayed up all night and did pony things
6_9
THE SMOOOOZE!
04<Memme> I am bored. Entertain me, fellow bronies. <-- But I don't wanna
:O
dedicated brony for life :D
...
Ghosties: But I wanna!
Memme: Only you can unbore yourself. :P
/me runs for his life
04Well
Ninjazz: ha.ha.ha. i'm so funny.
04Go juggle a melon or something
what is...dafuq am i...what the...
This video is pretty terrible.
Ghosties: Why not an apple? D:
tons of muk
04Because apples aren't for juggling :I
lol?
That is Lord Smooze, fillies and gentlecolts.
Ghosties: And how do you know!?
04I am the color of red
Destroyer of all of Equestria.
04And apples are red
Ghosties: can i juggle oranges then
but
04So I THINK I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT NOT JUGGLING APPLES, JUST SAYING
/me "muk i choose u!!!!!!"
the orange family...
Ghosties: And Applejack is orange. :P
00,02Ghosties, Logic!
YESY
I'm always amazed that the early pony series got just a little bit right, but the new one gets so MUCH right.
Ghosties: Well. Twilight is an egghead. I am an egghead. Therefore, I am Twilight Sparkle!
I LOVE THIS REMIX
Which is this PMV...PHas?
Phase4*
Magical_pablez94: what is muk spelled backwards
I GOT THIS REMIX ON MY IPOD YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
what remix
04Now you're thinking with logic, Memme :D
Flutterwonder.
00,02^
what is this remix
hey hey
Ghosties: Wow. My life has been changed.
xmasskills: u pervert :D
Why the hell am I listening to reggae right now.
04I know right
04By the way
It's incredible.
SO MANY WONDERS FLUTTERWONDER BY pinkiepieswear or wooden toaster i believe
04That Flutterwonder video that seems to have become quite popular
Added to favourites in a yip
Needs more A Beautiful Heart
I can't see the stream...
Now I can!
whats that thing sweetiebell made punch or something
That's a better SoGreatPowerful song imo.
i dont like it when people make lesbian pony porn
Random :S
I don't like it when people make pony porn.
04Funfact: it's very much in the same vein as the style of another famous DJ on YouTube these days: Pogo (Fagottron) and I emailed him last year asking that he would make a FiM song/video
Bronyx135: well there are only so many male ponies...
it disrespects our entire bronyism systm
Did he accept it?
00,02had to do a thing that probably bugged out the stream
00,02sry bout that
WHoa Whoa WHoa...
well still
I just requested the Fluttershy Fireflies parody.
Don't be getting on that.
04He never replied back
pony porn sucks
PONY PORN HURTS MY EYES MY BUTT AND FELLINGS
I hope they're nice and put it on.
Ghosties: Oh.
04Which, I figured he wouldn't
/me sighs
cake
So many kids in here.
04But still, it was worth a try
and it froze...
04Something wrong, Ninjazz?
each times she sais oooh i expect to hear "what a woderfull place :D"
beyond her garden"
:[
I don't like Fluttershy X.X
This is good too!
Ghosties: Just people not taking the time to understand another person's situation.
ALL UR BASE R BELONG TO US :[
04Prepare for an onslaught of hate and intolerance, Memme
My bass belongs to EVERYpony!
Ghosties: Yep.
OPPATUNITA
I am prepared!
04But then
Ghosties: Impossible, we share love and tolerance!
04The brony fandom is very fickle
/me grins and wheels out her bass cannon. :D
to all who think bronies suck
Y U SEE
I will love and tolerate the SHIT out of you
04So quick to ostracize and denounce anyone that doesn't like what the majority likes
That is... true...
Ghosties: The bronies, or haters?
P0N-3: You ddestroyed Discord with that...tkae it away XD
04The bronies
/me pounds the big red button on the top, and... all the dishes get clean.
BRONIES FTW
04Haters are trolls, bronies can be outright blind
Bye everypony I have to go
bronies or death
bye
I love discussing bronies.
oh hey
that reminds me guys
Cya fillyfillyy|AFK.
bai fillyfillyy|AFK
Oh look guys
I like discussing MLP with my non-brony firends.
*friends.
IT*S MEDIA TELLING THEY ARE AWESOME and only 5 see that SOMETHING is wrong! XD
why does everyone argue when someone says "somebody" instead of "somepony"?
I don't.
04Somebody
we dont say "somehuman"
Discussing MLP with non-brony friends sounds awkward. Do you like being awkward?
yes
I remember when being a brony just meant you like ponies and aren't part of the general target audience.
04Because I also don't use ponyisms either
or just simply say...something...
it makes good stuff to blog about
P0N-3: Well, I trust my friends.
;)
GO GRANNY!
P0N-3: I accept them, they accept me.
I want that hat
Kind of.
Ew. Bed mane Granny...
Yeah generally speaking being a brony is just being outside the targeted gender and age demographics.
i dont understand, but i agree
poor dashie...
Then we got terms like Cloppers, and other stuff.
ANYpony who likes the show and is not a little girl is technically a brony (or a pegasister if they're a guhrl).
04Though it's getting to the gender and age that FiM is targeted to
ugh
A question: If I enjoy watching MLP, am I a brony?
00,02woah
cloppers
PARIEL
00,02did that break for anyone else?
supporters of pony porn
MA LITTLE PONA
:D:D
It broke.
Phase4: It broke.
04Depends, Memme
If you associated more with the fanbase then I'd say Memme
:D:D:D:D :3
it dun goofed
04Everything okay, Phase?
not btoke for me
I WILL LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU!!! :[
*broke
there's no AJ emotion
04Bronyx135, it's okay
04You're fine
Ghosties: I saw a guy on Youtube who was like that. Enjoyed the show, but didn't want to be called a brony.
I think my neighbour is having CMFIS. She's ranting about pencils and lists.
Phase4-: broke
sorry
got bored :/
SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
Memme: Perfectly fine.
;)
I can hear him through the waaaalls.
00,02stream ended, it only streams if i've got stuff qued
04You don't have to love and tolerate to be a brony
whos your favorite pony guys
Twilight.
/me just fine hint hint
ttt
Him, he. It's a stallion. I don't know why I said she.
Twilight FOREVER
Bronyx135: Luna
JUST FINE HINT HINT
He crazy yo.
04In fact, I'd encourage you to use your reasoning and logic
Pinkie Pie
One does not simply pick a favorite pony
SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
00,02hmmm, the frame its stuck on sugests dubstep
Phase4: The video I recommended for you? =3
Ghosties: What do you mean?
Smile Smile Smile is one of my favourite songs so far.
for me it's stuck on the loading screen
Ghosties: In what terms?
pinkiepie always makes me laugh
04Maybe you should try to cut the stream and then re-stream
04When I say "use your reasoning and logic?"
shes always the one whos doing the exact opposite of the situation at hand :)
SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
04Is that what you're asking, Memme?
Ghosties: Yea.
what is going on here...
04@AppleJackTheOneAndOn: Please stop trying to demand requests
total broniness
I wish people used private chat more here.
thats what
WUuuuub!
BASS CANNON!
00,02VDXRetrotainment, sry, forgot about that
ME GUSTA MUCHO.
YAY
bass cannnon!
P0N-3: DAMNIT I told you TO NOT BRING THAT UP! AAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa....
P0N-3: BASS-CANNON!!!!
Fuck yo WUB WUB
Do they EVER take requests in #Vinyl_Scratch?
The brony fanbase is incredible.
00,02brb
yeah
P0N-3: Very seldon. =3
NEXT SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIE PIE SWEAR
except for the porn :(
AppleJackTheOneAndOn: Wrong chat.
04And what I mean is that the brony fandom tends to blindly follow love and tolerance, it's stopped being what it was originally meant to be and became a mantra of cult like proportions
P0N-3: no ttoday streamer is Phase4- but he's not in dat room :D
Porn is porn. There is no escaping it.
Ghosties: Yea.
Ghosties: Big groups
Come, my minions! Go to #Vinyl_Scratch and reqeust the ten thousand Fluttershies song! Vinyl Scratch COMMANDS YOU!
rule 34 i guess :{
:S
im back guys and i see love and tollerence has gone out of the window
04And I'm surprised someone still remembers #Vinyl_Scratch, haha
I do :)
Yea, lol.
there are worse mantras to follow. and I do think most bronies take it seriously and aren't just repeating it
I never forget it. But it's almost never used.
when i grow up
DO NOT MENTION RULE 34!
im gonna get spike's mustache
jk
Ghosties: alwys did but Phase4- is not in there:D
ITS BAD!
04#Vinyl_Scratch used to be used a looooooooooooooot
i have one XD
00,02i thought #vinyl_scratch was still muted
04It probably is
It is/
00,02its still muted
:|
Haha XD
First rule about rule34 is don't CLOP! Because they you can't STOP, and you has teh shame.
04Considering we don't allow the other rooms to be opened unless on Friday evenings or for Euro streams
john madden
any tips on how to break it to my mum im a brony?
Dj: Don't hide it.
04Just tell her you like the show
^
You don't need to break anything. It's not a big deal.
Be casual, it's just watching a show
abrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
My mum likes Rarity.
what?
but i might be going to B.U.C.K
She supports me getting Tshirts, etc.
Your mom is smart. ;)
rarity is a fashion diva
The first rule about ponies is please do not try to EAT the ponies! They are here to be entertaining, they are not here to be food.
with my mate
lol
I got her to do the personality test, and she was Pinkie Pie.
lol
Phase4: then unset it
BACON
im eating horse radishes...
TROLOL
04P0N-3, what are you doing -_-
err, *chicken, so that's what i ate last.
Phase4: Do you use a program that streams only one video then cuts and restreams it with the next in the queu?
00,02[WwqUB]JRP2234, i cant
00,02VDXRetrotainment, i use ffmpeg
04ate*
my whole city hates mlp except for little fillies, of course
agh what is with your fancy word colors
Ghosties, I am talking about some of the important things.
:(
Phase4- only has voice, not op
:'(
I don't know if some of you are dragons or other mosnters. But no, ponies are not food.
..
04Spouting on not "clopping" and not eating ponies is important?
00,02i'ma stream some wut
Ikr.
AGH DONT TALK ABOUT CLOPPING
00,02not sure what this is but google told me people like it
Why not?
Bronyx135: fancy pants colours = mods
OR I WILL LITERALLY LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
Clopping? Who's clopping?
04Because it's starting to sound awfully inappropriate
Google...
Oh sh't
what is diz
Are YOU clopping, Bronyx135?
Ok i never knew that pon-3 il just take scootaloo out of my mouth
00,02your speakers are not broke, it realy souds like this

00,02i actualy have this video for the song
Bronyx135: ....that's sure
hell yea
Everything can't be happy.
04No, everyone wouldn't be happy
00,02is it lagging for you guys?
most things can
It would only be relatively happy.
Face it guys, if you were really in Equestria with no internet you'd probably get SO bored.
There would still be sadness.
Phase4-: nope
You can't take that away.
Phase4: Nope
00,02urgh, one sec
Phase4: yesh but its not my controll
00,02there is a problem

Ninjazz: I thought I was going to use this on you...:P
/me builds a cube with all the sticks

Memme: See the list of names to the right? Look for a name that you want to speak to, right click, and send a query or PM.
14and I always disliked using touchscreens with fingers D:
/me hovers his hand over the "Launch Nuke" button.
/me names the cube Bob

With some chicken
VDXRetrotainment: o_o...:D
/me will not respond
/me flips Ninjazz s tomato soup
Ninjazz: Yes, the tomato soup distracted you while you were away.
TheRainbowDash: Fun fact. I don't care about how synonyms works.. I use the words where I Find them fit. Cocks = Roosters. Gay = Happy etc etc.
Well... It's gone now... -_-
So if you people have trouble with that, bring it up to the Academy of English :P
and with that I think I gotta sleep
VDXRetrotainment: Ok, ok, I see the differenece.
Don't expect normal reactions, Vordox.
Ninjazz: Rather be correct in English, then wrong in society.
VDXRetrotainment: Welcome to the modern world to retardness.
I hate how languages keeps getting destroyed by "General opinion"
00,02hey [WwqUB]JRP2234
yes?
00,02<< watch
Wuut
can some one explain why scootaloo is referred t oas a chicken?
Phase4- Just wondering if your going to play that video I linked
Alicorn: "You chicken"
0_0
What ever you want, man. Just remember that you aren't always the correct one even if the word is twisted.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Looks and sounds like one.

VDXRetrotainment: What the hay are you talking about?
TheRainbowDash: YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF THE MARKEt CRASH! D:
o_o
ponyloverforeva I vomited. Have a sore throat. And I had stomach pains earlier.
Hello everyone
VDXRetrotainment: How did I so?
TheRainbowDash: YOU Bought FPSes!
Herro, everypony
Wrek. I have no idea. They where cheap. MW3 costed 100 at EB games. 50 at JB-Hi Fi.
Hello Lil_B! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Lil_B: hi there how's r day been?
Vordox... That was TheRandomkid321.
Not TheRainbowDash...
hi Nabronyan
VDXRetrotainment: ....I didn't even say a thing for the past 5 minutes, until you pinged me.
Oh derp...:Ö
(facehoof):D
LOL
TheRandomkid321: <--- THIS guy.
STOP HAVING SO SAME names!
TheRainbowDash Magical_pablez94 hi, my day so far was good, thanks
Lil_B: happy to hear this :D
Lil_B: Oh, good to hear then.:)
Hey Lil_B!
TheRainbowDash: lol
TheRandomkid321 has ALWAYS been my online personality.
TheRandomkid321: <---THIS causes game market crash! :P
Ninjazz: /)
Now that my name and TheRainbowDashs names are together. I see the similarity.
hi ninjazz
Nabronyan: (\
:3
its soo hot here
TheRainbowDash: almost same messages :D
VDXRetrotainment. Eh.
who lives in england
TheRainbowDash: Buying FPS crashes the game market. :P
I live in Scotland, it's like 30 degrees up here
and has been all week
its 90 degress here
in england
I wonder what black ops 2 zombies will eb like.
probably like Black OPs 1
I want to get some dog tags. And have my name carved into them with my knife.
you should see how many people are here (where i live)
Sundaysmile BUT INT HE FUTURE! WOAH!
TheRainbowDash: Coincidentally, I hate the Call of Duty series.
Fuck...:D
Why do I ping myself?:D
TheRainbowDash: Why are you talking to TheRainbowDash? :D
Ninjazz: I made a derp also like VDX.
TheRainbowDash: hahahahah epic ping fail
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I LOST MY PONYMON SAVE DATA D:
Why is room so full of DERP?! :D
Ninjazz: It is derp hour, remember?
Nabronyan: ponymon?
TheRainbowDash I assume that was meant for me. I used to until my friend brought his game over. I WAS HOOKED! I like BF3 and MW3 because they really are not that similar. BF3 is slow paced and COD is fast paced.
TheRainbowDash I know that feeling XD sometimes you just feel lonely and you have to ping ourself
TheRainbowDash: Oh... right! :D
Magical_pablez94: It's pokemon, with ponies.
Lil_B: No, I tried to ping TheRandomkid321, but I derped.
hey TheRandomkijd321 hows your day been
Nabronyan: does it really exist?
hey Lil_B hows your day been
TheRainbowDash: NOW YOU KNOW! :P
alexxm filled with ouke
VDXRetrotainment: Ah, forgot you...:D
Magical_pablez94: Yes. There are two versions of the game right now : Dawn and Dusk
hope you feel better TheRandomkid321
Hi alexxm was good so far, been swimming, so i finally do something for my body XD
Eddie Izzard?
/me drools... " Nabronyan PLEASE give me the download link!!!!"
05y
Stream aggin... Shame too... Looks funny...
Anyone here ever heared of Carl Baron?
TheRandomkid321: Ah, I can see what you're trying to say here, but I am just thinking that these games could've have much more potential. Call of Duty and Battlefield (MW3 and BF3) could've have much better, if they focused more on the multiplayer, and if big money corportaions weren't throw into play, with hype as well.
05lagging for anyoen else?
Wreck: are you a pony? (on here)
Wrek: No lag for me at all.
hiya :D
a little bit, but it's pretty quiet
no lag here Wrek
my volume's up as high as it'll go
Hello Resonantwaves! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
05ponyloverforeva: wut?
TheRainbowDash soem people do not have stable internet. Luckily. I am not one of them.
hey Resonantwaves hows your day been
probably just my shit speakers though
nevermind...
-.-
Just a bit, Wrek.
its been good :D how are you?
I liked Atlas Shrugged.... at its heart its a romance novel
TheRandomkid321: And that is why I don't trust big first person shooters anymore, I know already that internet connections will be bad.
i'm good Resonantwaves
Carl Barron is a really funny aussie comedian. You shoudl look him up. You may not get the jokes though.
Resonantwaves: Ah, doing good myself. Woke up about an hour ago, to a brand new day.:)

cant wait to see the artbook hrhr
02Okay, 1 drf likes all the gens before gen 5, 2 he it’s up to him whether or not he likes MLP, and everything else you just said is your opinions
02-he
04BlueFlare
04Just
04don't
04it's not worth it
02well I'm already done XD
02I just had to :s
Oh, so one of the generations he likes is Gen 4?
The most failure gen up to now?
With horrible towns and cities
Horrible music
02there's a few Pokemon in gen 4 that he likes
Horrible variety
is my chet derped?
did the chat duie?
Horrible UI
05dunno
lol
VioletGreySha Nope
Horrible type diversity
We atre just SPIES!
And all?
/me heres the whiney of distant pnoies
Ninjazz hrhr
:D
What....:D
*hears
04Welp, I'm heading to bed folks. Have a good one
Hehehehe...
If Gen 5 was bad, Famitsu wouldn't have rated it 40/40
Hai :3
Bye Ghosties! (waves and hugs)
02UI Isn’t even a proper word to use in gaming
good night Ghosties
Just saying
night Ghosties
Cya Ghosties! Take care!
Gn Ghosties
bye Ghosties
If you have both a Gen 4 and Gen 5 game, go compare
Wrek, has Violet Vanilla poked around lately in here?
They had a touch screen in Gen 4, and they wasted it completely, using it for gimmicks
I MISSED YOU TAB BUTTON!
02and your not liking 4th gen is just as bad as drf not liking 5th gen
Wrek: you ever heard from Eisbrecher? its a german band dat got some nice tunes ^^
04opinion
Don't get me wrong. Gen 4 was cool for introducing online battles, trading, and Lucario
04all's said and done
05ill see if i cant try
02true Drake
VDXRetrotainment the last time i saw her (and the first time) was think ether after the season finaly or at the movie night a week later
But seriously, you prefer such a bad generation over one that improved on everything on the previous generation
and I'm just stating plain fact
VDXRetrotainment no, i Just remembered, it was after the TOM awards
Lil_B: During the anneversity
*coughOnlyTwoFireTypeLinesInSinnohCoughsoughsough*
Last time I saw her was the Tom Awards
VDXRetrotainment right XD
Afterwords
Well, his hating of Gen 5 is based on opinion
04so
But mine's backed with FACTS
04You dislike gen 4?
Not exactly, in the end
I like all the gens
Just felt Gen 4 was a huge disappointment given how revolutionary it could have been
02what matters is what someone LIKES, not facts. -_-
Which Gen 5 was
I also liked Gen 2 and Gen 3
02opinion^
05love this guy xD
Hahaha:D
04type diversity, variety and UI I don't have an opinion on so yay
02opinion
Hello
If the music was good, they wouldn't have used near-identical music for Gym Leaders and E4 battle
04...
It's already a fail on their part
hi TheUnnamedOC
Hello TheUnnamedOC! (waves and hugs) How are you today
04That
04just
And it's not as if they were limited or something, like Gen 2
04means
04doesn't
Quite good. And you?
Ah, doing good myself, thanks for asking.:)
Hello TheUnnamedOC.
We need. More Cowbell
OK, how about some of the route music?
hi TheUnnamedOC
Some of it didn't fit the route at all
04stop trying to convince me, because I happen to agree on your dislike
Hi Ninjazz and Mutterguy
OK.
04You're just being so damn hostile
Wrek: Question nr 2. You like Twi?
:)
If drf can be less in-your-face about his hate of Apple, Windows Vista and above, touch, new technology, Gen 5, and MLP:FiM, I will stop being so hostile
04so you'll be as bad as him?
His signature on the forums is so obnoxious I wince everytime I see it
04rather
And that actually made me stop even looking at them
04you'll be as "allegedly" bad as him?
02every time*
I'm just giving him a taste of his own medicine
Does anyone here play PonyMon?
Yeah
04Yes
If he hates it, then tell him to stop
04Because that solves EVERYTHING
Is getting a Lyra early on a good idea?
Then I will sop
05VDXRetrotainment should be ratehr obvious
*stop
Good, I'll add that into the sprite then
Not sure. Probably
Again, my request is simple
How far are you into PonyMon?
He stops being this anal
04I just did what I told Blueflare not to do. Fantastic.
Or GTFO
Nabronyan i was going to, but i wanted to wait untill its fully done
My Fluttershy is only level 8 :L
02it's people like you that make my dislike the MLP fanbase
02me*
>.>
don't think there's a mare he hasn't drawn...
I'
le Wild Vordox appears
Is that aboy, or a girl?
FECK
...m not going to force people to like MLP:FiM
I forgot my pass
But does he have to be so anal about it
?
Well, uh... Still havent gotten a badge yet :$
also a wiled Malavolent
wild*
"EW MLP" in giant typeface
I still remember that
Lil_B: Rawr.
Hey guys, Im gonna be writing a FanFic soon
02no, he shouldn't be, but there's nothing wrong with him stating that he doesn't like it
ooooo
For my OC, is Warhead an appropriate name for a nuclear scientist?
So thanks. It tastes f*cking <censored>.
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 14 time(s).
Nabronyan about what?
Oh thank god...Finally.
I don't go "LOVE MLP:FiM OR DIE" in giant letters on the forums
In case people wonder...<--- VDXRetrotainment
02you don't?
Would Aladeen approve?
Nabronyan depends, is he evil?
Never
02hurr
Not even in my signature
And I know he's watching
Vordox oh XD i didn't even know that
To be honest, I won't shed a tear if he dies tomorrow
He's neither. He's batshit insane, but not really EVIL.
I will in fact be celebrating the death of a hater
02..
02okay
02now
04yeah that's really extreme
02that is just
05but yeah vordox you bailed on a chance to meet me then :P
02yeah
Now let's see how he likes that
11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
Bipolar insane or just flat-out crazy?
04so
Nabronyan I (personaly, you name him how you want to name him) would name him somthing like "Dr. Insano" but this name is already in use by someone else
04eXARK
04You're intentionally saying that to provoke him?
He's Bipolar insane, but he's crazy most of the time.
He has said a lot of provocative things
Done a lot of provocative actions
To make us all hate him
04You're intentionally riling him up, "giving him a taste of his own medicine" based on the fact that you think he might be watching?
Not good at this... All I can come up with is Split Atom
02He’s not a “hater” he just has strong opinions like a lot of people.
Silly insane?
Split Atom sounds nice
Strong opinions doesn't entitle you to rub it in other's faces
Roara hated him
I'll choose between that and Warhead.
He started a war here over a simple typo
"yuu"
Thanks :)
/me Engages serious thinking face while deciding between the two names
*Jeoprady theme begins to play
You know why I wasn't around for some time?
Just to see if he has left this place
04answer my question please.
Nabronyan you have to sit down and get into the "The Thinker" position
05am i the only one paying attention to the stream? xD
You're intentionally riling him up, "giving him a taste of his own medicine" based on the fact that you think he might be watching? <- Yes.
I am trying. Who is that?
I know he logs everything
/me Gets into the Thinker Position, maintaining the universe-eating serious face that will destroy the universe if maintained too long
Wrek sorry, I'm not that kind of Standup-Comedy guy XD
05Eddie Izzard
I want him to know my feelings for him
and a few other people I know
Hello all :$
02Assuming he cares?
02he shouldn't
02if you ask me
Wat 6_9 I always though he was black...
Hello Irish_Pony. :|
He will
Trust me
Greetings Irish_Pony
Hello there Irish
Hey Irish_Pony!
Who's defending him every step of the way
Also, does anyone want to see the pony design Im using for Split Atom?
Oh gawd, not another fight eh? .-.
I want that fact drilled into his head
Wrek: Question nr 3: If you draw ponified, how do you draw to a canvas? :P
Very much
and get him to either stop or GTFO
Mouth, hoof, standing, normal pose etc.
And has a long code.
k
Wonder why she's not here much anymore?
05what?
Not even on the server?
04...
And Roara
04yeah
04ok
Wrek trying to come up with a sprite to add to Desktop Ponies, and you are the current one in mind
04I'm done with this.
Roara loved Gen 5
So trying to igure out an animation of you drawing on a canvas
Nabronyan: May I ask why you made that face when you said hello to me?
04I shoulda just kept my mouth shut
drf hated her because of it
Come on guys, pointless fights are pointless, peace and freinds before fights ._.
I'm just wonderinf, what pose do you do if you were ponified, while drawing on a canvas.
05i jsut didnt understand the question
Anyway I'm done
Still donät? XD
02drf doesn't hate anyone because of that
I was thinking.
05vad vill du veta?
02and Roara knows that
Then I wait for her to threaten me
My Thinking face is similar to that one.
02unlike you
Wrek: Ska göra sprites animation av Wrek som ponifierad, så jag undrar vilken pose skulle du göra om du var en pony för att rita på en kanvas.
To add to Desktop Ponies
I think drf is a nice and helpfull guy, ofcourse he has his "bad habits"
But im sure everyone has, right?
There's too many ways of doing it, so Just want a general position of it.
hey
Or a suggestion
this guy again
05hade lagt undan ciggen i askfatet, tagit en pensel i munnen och målat, sen lägga bort pänseln och plocka upp ciggen igen
05eller nått :|
XD
Weird question I know.
05no shit
But gotcha, noted.
Never been sprited before, have ye? :P
05nope
Well I'll add some flare to it then.
02pretty much
Hold up
Desktop ponies? I want them :o
You had the same reaction as Phase4 and Silverscreen
Going alittle "Wtf is he talking about" :P
05was easier in swedish tbo :P
Wrek: My swedish is worse then my English :P
05yet i udnerstood yer point better
Aye...Not a good sign
Fourth question now? :P
05y
Ok, how about more directly, stop fighting please? Last time i did i got threatend with a ban btw....it would be smart if you guys could stop the drama
05dracula, or dracul, or drac or D
Hur skulle du stå, som en pony, när du ritar, halvsittande, stående, 2 ben etc?
02hurr
I'm already bored of watching
That's the tough one as I need a suggestion for it.
And I've been here for less than a minute
dat text that i cant read :P
Irish_Pony: It's just to get one point across, it's nothing vital. :) Sorry for using another language in Chat.
Vordox: It made me go derp as well.:D
If it's cool with Wrek, it's cool with us.
come on, if you want to drama, you can at least make it popcorn-worthy drama ):
02lmao
05stående, kasnke lyfter en hov. pausar imellanåt och tittar snabbt på vad jag ritat hittils. vinklar huvudet lite a la en hund och sen fortsätter. med en lite frågande min.
05and yeh
05if that makes sense
It does.
Thank you. :) That should be all I need then!
Yea, drama can be amuzing, but this sucks .-.
Derp derpadie derp
02well, I could have rage quit, but then I wouldn't be here to see the drama :<
what kind of interview is this?
Now let's see how long it takes to do one animation...>.>
Brb 2 years XD
05heeh
05dont forget to show me ;3
Lighty, I was hoping to have some laughs ):
Id think if close freinds/close members would get banned, the whole community would go
Wrek: It'll take a while, just doing Violet's ONE animation took 5 days. ><
And you've seen it I think
<.<
JffibsjgiysdbfkgndkgjdngkdngWTF?!
05nope
Oh.

I dont even know wtf that came from
Ninjazz: Wait, what do you mean by that?
Dist upgrade should work fine
It's too early!
Xanbreon
Is it 5 in the morning over there?
linux mint
Well...
Ninjazz: It is never too early, nor too late for that stuff.
No.
basically, upgrading is reinstalling the entire f*cking system
What, really?
Yes
and doing it via apt is crappy
Okay, fine.... Go eat each other's ear then. -_-
Its based on ubuntu/debian, and they forgot to kang the upgrade system?
cus' it layers
instead of replacing everything
(nibbles on Ninjazz's ear)
Wowww
O_O
it's like a system gnome-shell
xD
Hahaha:D
means I need to backup my data
Mints more retarded than i though then
-_-
install mint 13
05ahem
then move everything back on
and reinstall all the stuff I installed via apt
well i go and sleep night everypony
Even Ubuntu can dist upgrade
x_X
:(
ubuntu is crap though
Bye VioletGreySha! (waves and hugs)
Night, VioletGreySha! :3
sleeping at 2pm hrhr
*eats all TheRainbowDash's ties*
and are you using arch or something?
My ties? why?
oh wait
debian
with gnome 2?
xfce
Ah yeah xfce
Have you tried apt-get dist-upgrade
Cos the interwebs are telling me that it should work
that
just installs the new kernels
Do you even wear ties?
No?
I'm a goat, baaa
/me takes a nap in his barrel
Ummm, no, not at all.
Unless mint is really retarded
Okay... :S
no lol
It should set the system to upgrade to a newer version
I did dist-upgrade earlier
dist-upgrade updates the kernel version on mint
/me backflips onto the ceiling
Calculating upgrade... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Guess... I'll just wait here.
that
lol
Whaaatttttt
the only reason why I'm using min
(drops the ceiling down onto the floor, 100 feet below)
mint
is because of the interface
-_-
otherwise I'd use debian with xfce
I am silly filly.
or gentoo even
:P
So basically, the only way to upgrade mint, is to wipe it out and reinstall?
but I can't deal with emerge
well
You are a mean silly filly. -_-
you can do the apt-get method
Thats <censored> stupid
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 103 time(s).
What? Mean?
but as I said
that only layers the new OS
instead of installing it
it's like a system gnome-shell
/me slids across wooden floor in underwear
Yeeehh
wut
(removes the flooring)
With sunglasses?
HELLL YEAH!
05no rp you two
which is silly
and I don't want that
Damn it.
Aww....:<:D
Alright.
1. waste of space and 2. I want mint 13 not mint 12 and a half
05seriously ts againts the rules and if you dotn start takign that seriously you'll just get in trouble
I dont see why they b0rked dist upgrade
>_>
idk either
Yeah, rping is illegal, you know!
Idiots
but I'm going to have to bloody reinstall
Twas just light RP, but okay Wrek.
I get it.
Twi_Fi: Look to the pony who's talkinb about that.
but this gives me a chance to format the swap partition as well
and move it down to something like 2GB
:$
instead of 8GB
who the HELL needs 2GB of swap
LVM! :D
is wrek drawing?
also
You mostly need 1:1 swap if you want to suspend
lol
x_x
Deadeagle: No, he is not drawing.
Hopefully.
I haven't used standby
ever
I never use standby
He is drawing a carrot.
on mint
Then you dont need 1:1 swap
And it will be EPIC!
Twi_Fi: Angel wants that carrot.
is anyone even streaming? or is it just random music XD
I've had bad experiences with standby
>_>
on my old laptop
Its a pita
if I put it on standby while on the charger
Deadeagle: Pretty much just random music I guess.
and then unplug the charger
If you have iffy drivers
The random music is the stream.
it'd fry the motherboard
As well as ponies!
roflol
which I then had to get replaced
Im actaully ignoring the stream, in a different tab im listening to Marine Cadences
Twi_Fi: Ah, forgot about the ponies.
We get Twilight Sparkle... So all bad I guess. (Needs more damn Rarity, damn it)
Not*
Ninjazz: Wow, that dedication for Rarity man, a lot.
My wrath as about to descend upon you Ninjazz.
and linux generally doesn't like standby anyway
*was
also 8GB swap is a waste of disk space
>_>
00,02someone dinged me
Twi_Fi: A simple typo, my friend. :$
00,02Vordox it seems
Holy crap...
Ninjazz: :)
00,02ohai Vordox
I have 2 I think
<.< I've been here the whole time Phase. :p
/me waits for Spell-of-Gaming to elaborate.
TheRainbowDash: I love her as much as you love Dashie, perhaps not as... You know... But STILL I LOVE HER! :$
If needs be I can shrink it and chuck it into my / or /home
<3 LVM
...my country's Cartoon Network is showing Total Drama Island.
Hai Phase again :P
Waaaa
I should repartition
I've seen it
Ninjazz: My wub for Dashie, you'll never understand how much it is.
and have /home as a separate partition
so I can upgrade
And frankly, it sucks
Yes, yes you should
without needing to do that backup and move
except that's a bit painful
05brb
TheRainbowDash: You've told me all about it. I think I can paint a picture.
<--- Same as VDXRetrotainment
Spell-of-Gaming: I saw the first season, it was pretty good, and then it got redundant after that.
Wait, mint makes everything one big blob?
how much should I need for /
My / is 8gig atm
Aye.
no lol, I just didn't partition it to have separate stuff
Im using 5.25gig
Ninjazz: Oh, right but it a lot more that I haven't told you, that will keep secret.
fair enough
TheRainbowDash: Yowza.
I don't think I'd need more than 10GB for / anyway
Gnome would use another gig
What kind of word is "yowza"?
As I said, LVM
Say it.
Then if you need more space
Nope.
Its really easy to add moar
-_-
:3
I'm waiting for myself to play all Key's "dating sims"
Wrek is gone, time for rp.
Nvm
I'm far to lazy to set LVM up x_X
+ LVM takes up space of its own
TheRainbowDash: I mean... If there is more to it than what you have already told me... You should either tell me or never mention it again. :S
Nothing worth bothering about
I think I'll probably only need /, /home and swap
Twi_Fi: There are 4 other mods who may be watching, with the excludment of Tom, because that bro is a bot.
can't remember what else
Mint installer cant do LVM?
>_<
Ninjazz: I'll never mention it, there.
idk
I haven't tried LVM
on mint
Yeah, that is why I didn't do anything.
noted.
/me is ignoring the chat like a boss
and I haven't used LVM for ages
I am scared.
Mhhm
Scared of what?
Ghosties.
Yes
Not the ghosties again...:D
I think /, /home and swap
Who you gonna call?
You know what you must do. :|
!xanbreon
Ghosties popping in, with his blood red text.....
We need to giggle and laugh them out of here, when they enter.
:)
or I could have /var as well
but that's a bit redundant
Ninjazz: I got it under control.
Ghostiesbusters. Who giggle the ghosts into packs.
Meh, I would just do / /home and swap
tonight: dd or lol? :P
As soon as I see ghosties' text I imagine dripping blood.
Ninjazz: Oh, i thought you meant take my sword, nevermind.
night all
I could also do /dev
I'll let you handle everything then, TheRainbowDash.
the rain destroyed my books
Night Mutterguy
Tonight Im going to a mates, his sister bday
but that's lame
Gnight Mutterguy!
Thus i will be very wasted
Bye Mutterguy! (waves and hugs)(
Bah
RP!
what filesystems do I set them as, Xanbreon?
Ext4
Oh
Do a /boot as well
So... I think I need a shower.
Yeah... I do.
/me throws a bucket at Ninjazz
Neigh!
=_=
/me starts doing random push ups
Wrek, is it okay if I follow your unconventional style within the DP?
aw oki
Ninjazz: A shower? Let me join in with you.
o_o
Your style is more stylizzed, but I'm not sure it'll be within the general term of what the ponies in DP is.
/me gives Xanbreon a few shoes "tehere are da boots!" :)
Daaaww Baka-Neku
Baka-Neku: D'awww....*dies of d'awness syndrome*
Ninjazz: I wouldnt question it, i would just go with it ;)
But make sure its the first partition on the disk
Ninjazz: TheRainbowDash: thanks =D =D
Of course, you would, Irish_Pony.
oh yeah /boot
Once I get into my groove, I will.
Irish_Pony: Hmm?
Baka-Neku: I like the comment below the picture about "ponies again."
/me facepalms
can't believe I forgot about that
oh yeah Xanbreon
/me lays back in his barrel
do I put that in front of Windows' partition as well?
Twi_Fi: i know XD i think it's some random dude XD i have no clue who it is XD
Could do some DD or LoL in a little, unno, you busy
?
Das boot
:3
I just have this sudden urge to...
good song :P
never seen the movie
hrm
Baka-Neku: Oh, I also like the pic too, btw.
gues nothing for people that get seasick easily :P
TheRainbowDash: Hmm?
TheRainbowDash: NOOOOOOOOOO
Twi_Fi: What did you think I was going to do?
Twi_Fi: thanks :3 im glad too hear it =D
hm, Xanbreon?
TheRainbowDash: O_O
(confused)
Get in the shower? :S
TheRainbowDash: Well what are you gonna do?
TheRainbowDash: O_O"
Ninjazz: That, and I was going to kick the barrel down the hill.
Both good things to do. :$
Wait...WHAT
D'awwww...:D
TheRainbowDash: :|
:<
Dont you dare....
you will regret it
The tension is heavy... Wrek could be watching us RP...
I won'y, I'll drop it.
Ninjazz: do something ?
ImOkayWithThis: Like what?
Ninjazz: The RP doesn't start until I get here, and that is good and bad.
TheRainbowDash: Mostly bad. :P
Yeah.
Wrek: Doing some music purely things? =3
Wrek is thinking, "soon."
Ninjazz: umm.. sit back and watch some Tactical Kicks?
Just the music is so amazing, while we chat.:)
In the middle of TRYING to come up with a sprite design of Wrek
Which is hard, since his style is...stylized. XD
ah
:D
Vordox: Just draw him with Twilight and your all set :P
I'm ganna head into that shower now.
It's like trying to draw Lego....WITH MONET style
the <censored> just happened
Please do not swear. You have sworn 26 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
Get the idea?
Netsplit
nope.avi
Ninjazz: Be careful about the spider.
yeah I saw

I blame you

MadSurge: Twilight of the Thunder God, by originally, Amon Amarth.
Now I'm back.
Any one miss me?! :D

Ninjazz: Ah, welcome back! (waves and hugs)
Oh I see WHY. Wrek, you naughty fanboy. :D
Hey Woodenfan!

Ninjazz: I still don't wub you.:D
I keep hearing good things about Amon Amarth :)
Hai everypony!
05Woodenfan: orgasmic isnt it?
Oh cool, yay, another awesome song.
soooooooooooooooo...torrents are being a bitch right now :[
Welcome back, Ninjazz
I still imagine you walking up to someone waving your hooves around and then finally hugging them.
Wrek: It's just loud
Hello |Discord|! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
TheRainbowDash: :c
and hello |Discord|
Hey |Discord|!
TheRainbowDash: I am well thank you

That is well
Just now, kenne. :O

What day is it today?
So all is well.

05at the end of the journey
Wow....:D
Wrek, SPEAKS!
hey guys i'm pretty bored... any idea of what may i do?
TheRainbowDash: I can't stand em...way to much if you ask me. But everypony has there different taste so I can't complain.
05i got a srs addiction
05but hey
05atleast its ponies and not cocaine again
|Discord|: Yeah, that is fine by me.
Nothin to be ashamed about, man.
Wrek: Lolz man you are funny
05how so?
Just the way you said it
eeyup good one Wrek. Wait, you were addicted to cocaine? maaaaaan
Ponies addiction=just fine and accepted by the of the brony community only, drugs addiction=only fine by drug addicts,.....kind of similar, I guess.
Or where you serious?
05nah, ponies and metal
05and nicotine
PONIES. AND METAL.
Lots of it.
I see no problems.
thats the most brutal combination known to man
Ponies and bronze!
Perfectly fine with me.
And for myself... COFFEE!
wait......
Ninjazz: A very expected combination none the less
05ZEUS HAS GRANTED US... BRONZE
Ninjazz: Man, hay, forget your stupid coffee.
05+10 for reference
|Discord|: Unless you count dubstep and ponies.
TheRainbowDash: i'm bored any idea what ca i do?
Ninjazz: THat one to...
Magical_pablez94: Whatever preference games you like, I guess.
05mfw i jsut realized 2 songs in a row now have had twilight in their name
What?... Not usually my job, but...
Magical_pablez94: Listen to music...that perks the body and mind up right?
Wrek: Twi has taken over the music industry now.
Ninjazz: HEAVY
is that supposed to be a coincidence?
|Discord|: ZUES HEAVY.
|Discord|: yeah music how coudn't i think about it ?:D thanks a lot:D
Boat tilts, tablet screen tilts
X.x
05folkmetal is my metal
05cause i keep goign back to it
And don't you dare be taking my coffee, TheRainbowDash. :|
Ninjazz: How can I? I already did.
TheRainbowDash: If there is a will. There is a way. :>
coffee, do not want
Yes, now a soothing song, I hope...:D
Eww, cofee.
It never tasted good to me.
-_-
TheRainbowDash: dont count on it
As well as any kind of alcohol.
You folks crazy.
Nevermind.
05mmmm coffeeeeeee
There is is.
Wrek: (\
Any chance anyone here knows how to fix laptops?
05 /)
Ninjazz: Im not crazy man, get it right i'm Insane
Ninjazz: Ugh....
Ninjazz: You have 5 seconds to tell me one thing coffee gives me and chocolate milk don't.
05is it an IBM/lenovo?
Malavolent: A good morning.
05and is it a hardware failiure or software failiure?
I have a key that refuses to work unless I push it ddddddownd rdeally hardddddddddddddddddddd (But you see what happens.)
TheRainbowDash: What the matter?
Malavolent: caffine, still dont like coffee though
Ninjazz: Ah, forget it.
Ninjazz: I don't think so. Every morning is good with hot chocolate milk.
ImOkayWithThis: Noted.
05hardware failiure then
05now
05what brand is the laptop?
emachine E525 series
Malavolent: Depends who enjoys it, then. Perhaps its better that you don't even start. Buuuuuuuut, I love it.
05ok you can service it and get the keboard replaced
05or you getr a cheap keyboard that you use instead
Ninjazz: Well, I've tried it, but like I said, it never tasted good to me. Neither does alcohol. I'm going to save sooo much money.
Me no like coffee, but i prever milk in the morning (because I'm too lazy to pour the Cacao in at and heat it up)
I alreay trie cleaning it. Blew into a straw to get the gunk out. Not work for long until it broke again. No money for replacement.
05potential risks with turnign it in is that you spend money and get afull servie and end up getting your HD wiped
Malavolent: Ever tried putting milk or sugar into it?
Cream*
Monfang: how old is it?
Less than a few years
Dafuq did i get milk from?
Ninjazz: I wouldn't even try it without sugar, but I've never tried it with cream, to be honest.
Is it that different?
But I game aggressively.
Malavolent: Much different.
05i pity ragegamers
Ninjazz: Ok, I'll give it a try someday.
Not rage
05so much wasted money
I put a lot of energy into it.
Wrek: Who is a ragegamer by your definition?
i once punced a keyboard in the spacebar when i wouldnt jump in tf2
Malavolent: Just try to balance the sugar with the cream. Sometimes it just comes to you what works best.
05the whole group? people who use uneccesary force in their keypushing
05but then theres the cathergories
05all form the ones that break their keyboard in hald and pulls the plug
05and so on
used blu tack and a lillipop stick to repair it
lollipop*
Ninjazz: Ok, you're responsible for my possible obsession with coffee then :)
Malavolent: Noted. :)
ugh. I died in IWTBTG...again
Wrek: Oh, these people :D
I never thought I hit too much. But it explains why my mouse is having similar problems
05now
05looking at the keyboard
Typing without one letter is not easy
05it seems like repairing it would require some finesse
Monfang: if you can't somehow get the key to work again, then i think you could try this, if you think you can handle such a thing:
My keyboard is anything but clean...
05if you remove the faulty button there should be a rubber surface udnerneath that is the actuall button
guys what do the different servers do per se?
05a knob per se
Wrek: I know how to take a laptop apart. I just feel that is excessive. Ya, I know.
oh
Monfang open up the laptop, disconnect the Keyboard from the motherboard and try to use a other Keyboard (USB or PS2[not the console])
05now if this blob is not coming back up when pushed down, or needs to be pushed down hard
05you need to repair the rubber thingy which is hard
Push hardddd
05otherwise if its the feathering of the plastic that is borked
05jsut get a spring in there
Accidentally learning.
back
05Lil_B: apparently he didnt have anotehr keyboard/could afford one
I can push it all the way. Just have to push and hold to get ti to type, then it types a string of letters.
05sounds liek the string in the rubber is glitching out
05metal string*
05wire
05w/e
Ah, got to nom for a while everypony, be right back in about 15-25 minutes.
How remove the key?
Cya Dashie!
05depends on the keyboard
Go nom some toast!
05soem you can pry off
05some have a delicate bounceback plasting thingy that you MUSNT break
It work when I clean it for a time. Why is that?
05defien clean it
05fine*
I clean it. It work but stops later on.
Yo, Ninjazz ?
05i dont know what you mean with cleanign it
Sup.
05what exactly do you do
Where are you from anyway?

Oh... okay :D

05have a hard time thinking its due to a loose wire or something. my best guess right now is that the wiring inside the keyboard silica is either damaged or glapping on the D key for some reason.

05my tip to you monfang is to get an external keyboard
Damn dirty aus trolols
05that is cheap so you atleast have a workign set of keys
I RETURN
welcome back Derpy_Hooves
05disconnect the built in keyboard and try to find whats wrong.
I'll try that when I can.
05cause i suspect you dont want to turn it in so i present the alternatives i can think of

on screen keybord?
For now, I push dddddddddddddddown hardddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
clunky but useful enough
not for gaming
How long do you hold that down, Monfang?

Ohh Laptop keyboards are a derp to fix.
I once made a troll scrip on a laptop in school in Basic....
Hate doing that

Reminds me of my teacher, who told us how she had tried to fix her notebook keyboard.
Ahhh/
Hell yea

Hey Kids!

OctaviaChaser:

Twi_Fi: :

TheRainbowDash: Knew it. :D
Twi looks awesome in that pic
OctaviaChaser: :)
But need to replace soon
TheRainbowDash: Toast is bad for you.
Twi_Fi: Why?
Twi_Fi: So is alcohol.
Twi_Fi: lies!
TheRainbowDash: I don't know.
Twi_Fi: Ok then...
i have had this MX518 nearly 5
But do you like toast, TheRainbowDash?
oh hey look at what i found
My teacher had chipped a key from her notebook keaboard with her fingernail. So she poured a little super glue on the key a put it back in the keyboard.
years
De definition of doing nothing: Having work to do, but still staying in a chat all the time, even thou you don't even write anything in there ether!
Twi_Fi: Yes, I wub it.
TheRainbowDash: Then it's bad for you.
and if i click too hard it stops registering the click
Twi_Fi: Tell me why.
Lil_B: i know that feel
TheRainbowDash: Because anything we enjoy must be bad for us.
Twi_Fi: Yeah, like ponies, they are bad then.
Yes, they are.
Oh so bad~
05a mouse and keyboard, for them to last, requires a delicate touch
o_o, really?
my father needs the computer... gotta go... cya later :D
Depends on how you look at them. :D
My life expectancy has decreased dramatically due to my love of MLP.
Wrek: A delicate touch of hammer.
I don't do well with delicate
05a twilight hammer
Ninjazz: I look at them from a general standpoint, not including of internet terms and inequals.
teh|Spitfire: hey hey.... who said you could go on WoW?
TheRainbowDash: I look at them from every standpoint possible, opens the eyes a bit.
Ninjazz: Then they are some of the worst things ever to spawn out of a person't mind.
OctaviaChaser: alchemy my friend
(person's)
Wrek wanna know whats a bummer to fix?.. A drawing tablet now thats hard :O
who wants to play the orange box?
im gunna find it hard to leave this place to go back and play maginobi
05if the sensor fries, you're fucked Nerom :P
TheRainbowDash: The internet, in general, has some of the worse things imaginable at anyone's fingertips just waiting to be accessed and ruin someone's day or life. :S
Indeed
Ninjazz: Well, forget the internet then.
TheRainbowDash: Hell no.
:<, why not?
BECAUSE PONIES! :D
Wrek: What tablet are you using again?
05intous 4
Ninjazz: That's a contradiction you made upon yourself.:D
What brand?
05wacom
TheRainbowDash: I didn't say I didn't like having bad things. :P
Thanks, they're only selling god forsaken Genius tablets here :|
I can smell my mum cookng the dinner and its drivin me crazeh
Ninjazz: Oh...derp.
TheRainbowDash: But some shit is pretty bad and shouldn't be watched too long. :S
If otherstuff in it breaks then your also going to be pretty much fucked because if yea mess around to much you can fry the sensors. Also I have the same tablet wrek :P good pice of eqipment
Like what now Ninjazz?
05mhm
05the tips burn a bit fast
05but good thign there's replacements
Only set back
TheRainbowDash: Some of the stuff on 4chan is a good example, not going any further cause I'm feeling pretty good right now.
and tips a cheap
Ninjazz: Do go on.
Twi_Fi: Not tonight.
Ninjazz: Ah, I don't even go there, so one point for me.
:>
I've heard that 4chan makes a lot of toast.
Twi_Fi: Wait, really?!
Now you just baiting. :D
I wub toast, so that means...(brain trying to compute, pushing my hooves together)
/me is getting tired
I go to go on 4chan then Twi_Fi?
TheRainbowDash: Yep :)
05this song was rather nice :3
TheRainbowDash: Go to Ponychan, much better alternative.
whatup
hey wrek
Hey flutter_spin!
Ninjazz: I go there a few times, but on rare occasions of true boredness.
Hey flutter_spin
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28572/Moon-Time its finished
Hello flutter_spin! (waves and hugs) How are you today? And cool, a fanfic? Awesoem!
(awesome)
TheRainbowDash: Serriously, Dashie, 4chan ain't no place for unprotected minds.
Yeah, a sequel to my first one "Drocsid"
4chan needs strong minds to be resisted/ not severely grossed out.
It has Wrek, SB, Sumica, DeathStar in it
Damn I hate whn my chat stops working for no reason
Oh and me as Moonlight Sonata
Ninjazz: My head is protected, and I can handle anything that anyone throws at me.:)
05so flutter_spin: i look forward to reading that chapter xD
TheRainbowDash: Tally Hooooooooo, then. :3
lol, I hope I captivate your essence
Ninjazz: ...i just don't really feel like it now.
TheRainbowDash: *pats head* Alright then.
So wrek a question what is your fave nib to the tablet pen :P
*is patted* Cool.
I sort of want to write another one, but frankly I'm kind of bored.
Hi bronystate.
I wanted to do something in which Sumica was some sort of awesome pegasus fight against Chyrsalis
but eh.
hay ppl waz up
Hello FillyFlam.
Hello the
Hello FillyFlam and the.
brb, gtggssf711.
I guess I could always have Wrek kick her butt.
I'm ready to kill my torrent
So... I just got a complement on my bio again... Wow...
Have his paintings come to life or something. That would be cool
05to defeat chrysalis i painted ragnaros
hay ppl
lol
05and to get rid of ragnaros i painted 10/25 people
I shall put that in my notes
With epic gear?
And we have drawing stream.
So anyone else want to be included if I make another fanfic?
flutter_spin: Can I be in it? Even though you barely know me? :$
Just need some pic/idea/name
And it can't be NinjaTheAwesome
Ninjazz is fine.
I don't even know what that means :P
Ninja + Jazz :D
flutter_spin: Yeah, something about jazz musiv, while holding swords and stuff, like ninjas.
Can't I name ya "Ninja Blade"?
(music)
Sure you can. :)
Ninjazz: What about Ninja Guiden?
jazz blade?
or Ninja Star. I could do that.
TheRainbowDash: Not sure which clan i would want to be, but Ryu is too OP to be part of my clan of weak ponies.
Ninjazz: Oh...
Ninja Star... Sound good.
well im gunna kind of fade out here
Infactr Ninja Star
Yea, you can be brother of Death Star's OC Night Star
I put him in "Moon Time"
00,10ohhi chat
Wow... That sound pretty cool. I can be DeathStar's brother?
o hai sumica
Hey Sumi!
lol
AFTER NEARLY 24 HOURS, NEARLY ALL OF MY TORRENTS ARE DONE
where have you been Sumi?
Ugh, Secret of my excess, I love that episode, JUST. DOWNLOAD. ALREADY.
pshh, took me 3 days straight to dl AvP game
00,10freaking nightmare about bugs and a filty restraunt.
from steam
/me shudders
we killed a rat in our restraunt
!espeon
Hello Sumica! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
o_o
I hate bugs.
what a story sumica
I killed the script
Ninjazz: They are ok, just that spiders are the ones that make me cringe. They creep me the fuck out.
One of the bad sides to having dreams, eh?
i only have bugs when they dont let me sleep in the summer
hate
TheRainbowDash: You and me both, Dashie. *Shudders*
00,10I tend to wake up right away from nightmares vut still the image is there
*shudders as well*
I hate bugs too, i guess thats why i don't mind spiders
Image of what?... How bad was it?
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
00,10nice long coat wrek
So anyone stay up for Toonami?
How?
I think that's enough of that script for now.
00,10Shame dusters are so over heavy to ship I got one you would probably look good in
I think i finally found out why I'm most productive during the night. I think I need some kind of deadline to do work
OK.
I don't get Toonami till a week after it airs in the US.
Lil_B: What if there was no deadline for something?
I saw Toonami last night. It was pretty bad. :s
aw
TheRainbowDash Then it will take a LOONG wime untill it's done
Not a good sign...
Ninjazz: I got Toonami here in Batlimare, but didn't watch it. I didn't feel like it at that time, and still don't today.
I think a deadline makes me more nervous. I tend to be productive if I have a cheerleading squad
what is Toonami?
Someone ping me when they are choosing the peeps for L4D2 please.
!breeface
Lil_B: Some sort of anime show that everypony freaks out about.
Ohai
TheRainbowDash: Anime in the US should embraced. The better it gets here, the more anime we can enjoy here.
Lil_B: its a show that used to air on Cartoon Network like 6 years ago. It came back on Adult Swim
Here's a tip for you, Toonami: Just making shows that normally occupy that block is pretty lazy. BLEACH SHOULDN'T BE ON TOONAMI, DAMMIT
I have L4D2, but I don't know how good I am
Agreed.
btw, Bleach's animation sucks ass. I used to REALLY like it, but now it's so...STUDIO PIERROT, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
But it had Ghost in the Shell. That had to count, right?
It doesn't even matter who you're targetting, you're spamming and basically desperately waving your hands fishing for a reaction
Ninjazz: Oh right. Over here, we just don't really accept ideas from other countries, because we got our own cartoons and such. To me, anime is fine, just that i am not so into it.
you're lucky you're not ding dong bannu already
I wouldn't know... I need to wait for a bit to reach here.
TheRainbowDash where do you live?
Lil_B: Baltimare.
00,10all they did was rebrand saterday [AS]
TheRainbowDash: Maybe...
TheRainbowDash I meant the country XD, but its the US right?
I know Sumica, that's why I didn't watch it.
Lil_B: Yeah, it is...:D
Well, that sucks, Sumi. I was hoping for a legit return.
besides, you can still go to the other streaming site of Toonami Aftermath
<censored> bastard
Please do not swear. You have sworn 27 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
I was going to ban him earlier
00,10then again anime block [AS] was just a rebranded Toonami midnight run
But thought to wait a while
agreed Sumi.
-__-
eeyeah
Not happy about that...
I'm tired of him
Whatever. I'll watch it and make up my mind about that.
See I'm not particularly one that agrees with drf often but
I shall forever remember Midnight Run that introduced me to music videos like Daft Punk and Gorillaz
I think Europe got into Anime a little it earlier because it didn't had so much own animations like the US
Just... My hopes have been lowered a bit.
This has been going on for too long
oh well
yeah sorry Ninjazz. Not as good as it was.
via PM and serious talks
Chrysalis is best Alicorn http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4nyxgotRg1rvwsino2_1280.png
/me sighs
he's "apologised" but never really listened
So
I'm over this
It needs more popular anime at that time block, not just rebranding AS Anime block
And if he tries to dispute it and complain, which he will, I have so much evidence against him
CrimsonPhoenix that picture is awesome
And I know a lot of other people in here will agree with me
Ok, how'd Chrysalis become what she did? With the holes n such?
Fanon.
Sumica: I thought those clips looked familiar. LAZINESS
Woodenfan that's purely fanon
ah ok
00,10I should stream Interstella 5555 again
I'll just watch the damn show... Hopefully some shows will be worth it.
Yes, you should, Sumi.
and it's from a chrysal-YES SUMICA
Oh, cool Sumi, that sounds great to me.
I can already hear the Daft Punk coming to my ears.
Is that the Anime with Daft Punk music?
....oh, did anyone hear that the annoying orange is coming to cartoon network?
/me is back.
Lil_B: It's better to say Virtual Album
Daft punk music and anime go so well together.
Visual**
TheRainbowDash: I thought it'd be coming to Nickelodeon. Well, I'm not watching it either way.
00,10Fun fact, Interstella 5555 is the first thing I ever stremed here
oh god
And that instantly made you awesome.
ugh. Reminds me of *draws a blank* that Freaky Fred guy on Nick
05still got a long way untill my leather coats are perfect
Woodenfan: Yeah, it is on Cartoon Netowrk. Not really interested either. I just want popular Youtbers to stay on the internet, and not expand into cartoon series and such.
:<
exfail
eeeeeeeeyegh, WHY TV WHY? First Fred, now this, why can't they accept that WE DON'T WANT IT ON TV
00,10cute twi
I wonder why he came back from hiding anyway
Dem Coats
A good 98% of the Fred movie was him screaming.
that's why I do not watch TV anymore
I can find everything I want in the net
Woodenfan: Involved money, it will always backfire on us, the viewers and the consumers.
then they had a special with him in iCarly
yeeesh
yeeeeeeeeeeeeah :(
I'm glad Freddie said he didn't like Fred. I think having a sense of opinion is a good thing.
hello
00,10You know who has an awsome leather jacket, Dickshep
^
Hello CCCP
Hello CCCP! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Hey CCCP!
Then they said they'd do mean things to him unless he liked fred. BULL. SHIT.
hai Twi_Fi TheRainbowDash and Ninjazz
Woodenfan: Wait, what things?
TheRainbowDash: im good you?
lol my fic is still in queue. I put it up my 8pm last night. It still has like 15 in queue.
First time I saw that jacket, Sumi, I was like "Holy crap... Is that really his normal clothing?"
05whats the name for the sown part of a piece of clothing
CCCP: Ah, doing good myself. Getting myself prepped for writing a new story for my god friend here, Kipkat07_Mare. Need to stretch my hooves more, though.
Good*
seam?
A button?
oh hai thar CCCP
TheRainbowDash: oh :)
seam maybe
hai Lil_B :)
00,10So yeah back on Toonami. I guess I have just become too cynical and I just got the feeling they saw the reaction to the april first thing and saw it as a great way to bump rateings for the saterday anime block for the new shows they bought.........witch I might add sucked
yeah, a lot of those new shows are crap
Oh cynicalsumica.
Ah, Sumi, that april fools things, that really ticked off some people.
I think the room for april 1st was a better idea.
There were just so many awesome shows on Toonami. It was crazy.
Twi_Fi: He is Sumical now.
00,10zoom in on the part wrek
they should replace all crappy shows on tv with FIM
CCCP: A pony takeover of television and corparate standards? I want all in.
They really handled that April Fool's thing pretty badly huh?
00,10that ginda goes back to the same reasion we dont show ponies all the time here CCCP
TheRainbowDash: ikr!
I take my ponies in moderation.
true Sumica, there's only 52 episodes now, and torrents are easy to come by
Too much makes me jaded.
I will be out of the chat for a bit, I have an idea for a picture Xd
Sumica: it only replaces crappy horrible shows
Just as long as they don't start airing Starcraft esports or the like
Oh, alright then Lil_B, see you later!
cya Lil_B.
Cya Lil_B
bye Lil_B
00,10Speaking of torrents. just got danVs
Wait, this kind of sounds this the Tetris theme a little, right?
Yay, you don't want to burn out on ponies.
:O
woot Sumi
*Yeah
Sumica: You just won the game.
Are you going... To you know?... Stream it?!
I watched the rest of the first season. It was awesome
00,10seeing as two eps of lyoko was startng to cause rage last week
I'm really watching the Hub for MLP, that Aquabats thing I saw yesterday is INSANE.
lol. Lyoko was... Lyoko. It was fun to kill time
Woodenfan: Ah, I saw that too, but at least Aquabats is fun to watch.
Yeah, I didn't like Code Lyoko growing up, and I don't like it now. Avatar, the last Airbender, on the other hand, was great. Keep that up.
But if you want to "watch" something, that works
Baka-Neku: Very nice!
Twi_Fi: i thank you
Still D'aaaaaaaaaaw, Baka-Neku. :)
nice!
Baka-Neku: D'awww....
made the eye less creepy
Baka-Neku: dawwwww :D
silly Phase
Phase4: ha
Phase4: Pinkie definitely fits that part.:D
lol Phase4
yup Phase4, good one
00,02Twi_Fi, ikr
00,10wow I was gonna say this show is more awsome then I remember then I relised it was wreks rock
00,02Baka-Neku, D'
00,02*derp*
00,02Baka-Neku, D'awwww
It si official. COD WAW is dead.
Sumica: what'S lyoko and why cdid it cause rage?
TheRandomkid321: Wait, why?
Pretty, flutter_spin.
00,10Code lyoko Dark_Horst
flutter_spin: Wow, that is so beautifully drawn.:)
TheRainbowDash I couldnt find any games online today
eh
It's a french anime that aired a while back.
I HATE code lyoko.
Used to love it.
But I dont even call it anime
I found it to be pretty good.
Good morning everypony!! :)
TheRandomkid321: Oh well, that game is 4 years old anyway, and of the least noted Call of Duty game in the franchise.
Anime is Japanese
Hey RaveBrony!

I also played some Black Ops. It was fun till the enemy had like 3 choppers and Rc XD's everywhere... Probably hacking now That I think about it.
Well... It could be worse.
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Why so? It is always a party here in Bronystate.

A party here on BronyState?

Ninjazz: It's too fucking hot!:[
TheRainbowDash: Eh. Trying living here and complain.

Ninjazz: How hot does it get over there?
Woodenfan: i dont think it is the flavour of goatcheese that you are thinking of when you sas gross
TheRandomkid321: The summer is too hay hot over here.
Woodenfan: that like saying bacon is gross
TheRainbowDash: Sometimes high 90... Actually, you know what? I can't complain this place is famous for having the same temp all year long. :D
This is England, the weather is never right.
TheRainbowDash, we just had to have you as our guest for dinner :D
Hello Derpy_Hooves and Meanwhile.

Ninjazz: Oh, wow. Yeah, that is a little extreme for my tastes. Sometimes, we get bursts of 100+ degrees for a whole week. And MelaPonie, I will be honored to come.

TheRainbowDash: Owch. Sounds pretty hot. :S
My bro wants me to play Minecraft with him, heh
It actually gets REALLY humid here. Tha'ts the problem.
Ninjazz: Yeah, it can get scorching here. It feels like I am burning in an ove-o_o, wait a minute...

MadSurge: Alright, 32 degrees F=0 degrees C, and beyond that, 1.8 F=1 C.
TheRandomkid321, 17, sounds nice :D

Irish_Pony: Nyeh.
/me is confused about capitalism
MelaPonie too... ucking... cold
CCCP: The key is don't think about it and you're a winner.
bucking*
TheRandomkid321, when i go cave diving, the water i dive in is 22 year round
TheRainbowDash: then i wont
AW SHOOP! I LOST THE GAME! SONOFABEYOTCH!

/me suspects that MadSurge is a spy with a political agenda.
Hey, I use the big shiny gauge outside. It has a number 97 where the red stops. That's what I go by
CCCP: me too :D
/me huddles in corner
oh my god, lmao http://www.lolbrary.com/post/9754/a-valid-complaint/
TheRandomkid321: The fact that it is so early in the year for this to happen is odd.
Is it too much to ask for it to thunderstorm 24/7 7 days a week? Ok probably but damnit let me dream.
I'm actually a changeling, booyah
TheRainbowDash: Are you done?
MadSurge: :D
TheRainbowDash thanks for another sleepless night.
MelaPonie: Dat legit complaint.
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Wait, with what?
i'm confused.
Could ya stop talking about the enviroment?
/me throws gun into chat
TheRandomkid321: http://i.imgur.com/hfgnR.jpg Here's ya grammar nazi
/me throws gun out of chat.
TheRandomkid321: Umm, sure thing, if you wat me to.

TheRainbowDash: You know, are YOU done? I though you were being cooked?
Ninjazz|Night: http://www.taclink.org/tk/src/132312088737.jpg
/me Unholsters 44. Magnum "WHO THREW TAHT GUN!?"
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Apparently, I already got cooked and eaten.o_o
I've just seen an hilarious convo where voice actors read the script of Star Wars, hilarious stuff
TheRainbowDash: OH MAH GAWD!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't find the pic. I was going to post the one that had "Must be 18 years old and have 20 years work experience"
CCCP: Now this chat will go into RP insanity, (claps for you slowly, with an unamused face)
/me puts hands up
In other news, http://derpy.me/nZd46
He said something along to lines of "checking whether drf was still here or not"
CCCP: You're so lucky these bullets cost me 10 grand each.
/me laughs at TheRandomkid321's magnum and it dissapears
TheRainbowDash: muhahahaha

Oh my :D
Why do you get kicked out when you say something 6 times in 10 seconds?
or sumthin
00,02Mirju132, it prevents spam
ooh
Mirju132: To prevent...yeah that.

Wrek I did read them. I have short attention for stuff I dont ever think I will need
00,02its got a lot to download aparently
Wrek: Isn't a mod requirement to know the rules by heart?
A tip of my hat to my cat

But I have no time atm to install it
Well, it *is* a huge improvement over 12
will do it in a few weeks
I want asprin.....
I HAT

Phase4: Servers with custom content usually do.
Cinnamon doesn't crash as often for one
Ah, time for me to take a shower now. Be right everypony, and Ninjazz|Night, would you want to join me?:D
05TheRandomkid321: unless you read the rules, and understand that this is sometihng i shouldnt do
05and still do it
But, they remove hibernate, and now use Kernel 3.2 (I upgraded to 3.4 stable as usual)
bye TheRainbowDash <3
05then i count that as not reading the rules.
TheRainbowDash: Sure. <3
Nor does chocolate...
LOL JK
You can reenable hibernate though, works perfectly
Oh my.....wait, what?!
o_o
Oh
. . .Car in an house: Women Driving. Burning house: Men in the kitchen... (something i found in 9gag :P )

Phase4: His name is Wrek. Look for the surprise buttsecks soldier face.
05add the opne with creepy soldier
Wrek Well Im sorry. Okay. I have a short attention span to things liek that... Now if everyone escuses me the voices have returned...
It is all centered to the middle of the screen, your desktop options are in the middle, other stuff to the left and right
Bye RainbowDash.
yayy
3 icons for options now
TheRainbowDash poor you :(
Tons more themes for Cinnamon preinstalled too
Logmein through 3G is awesome.....working on new OS on my Pc....via my tablet x3
holy crap Wrek is playing TF2?
Dat tiny Twilight
thats different.
i almost forgot..
Yet I can't seem to customise it properly because it breaks the icon sizes badly x.x
im gonna make a sandwich then come back and put some desktop onies
ponies
brb
00,02it randomly gives people pony models
PONIES :$
00,02actualy rather mundane
05aitn got all day Phase4
does it have proper battery options? -_-
also my graphics driver doesn't work with it lol
:V
but somehow the linux wifi driver works better than the windows one
seriously wtf
00,02sry, suddenly became luna
the windows one screws up and sucks at initially connecting to a network
Pfft.
linux has no issues at all
05Phase4
I'll bbl goin job hunting.
I'm going wtf at it
05name on steam?
Hello?
hai
I have a feeling that they made the graphics performance WORSE
/me huggles Deleted_dreams
In this release
:3
x_X
Possibly, not exactly sure yet
05Phase4
05name on steam?
Well
05Phase4
in this
05name on steam?
:D
taskbar flashing doesn't work
00,02Wrek, ariscop
How do you do that CCCP?
so xchat doesn't alert me on highlights, PMs, etc.
00,02aparently the add friends thing is broken and i cant find the server info button
Phase4: You should add me too >.>
weird as it works for me
sorta
sometimes on-hover descriptions break and stay there until I restart
Deleted_dreams: you type /me
but the battery hasnb't changed other than
and I can't change screen brightness
We need to get bronystate on one of SLAG Gaming's gamemode madness servers.
That'd be rockin.
/me then type what you want
/me huggles CCCP
Well, the onboard graphics driver sucks
:D
a really useful battery bar in the menu
:|
What type?
and fglrx is such a pain
intel radeon
Intel HD 2000 works perfectly for me
it's not the graphics card's problem
on no ati :c
it's the bloody sandybridge driver
that linux comes with
Linux Mint works pretty well on here <lucky me>
and fglrx breaks it
ew :|
Download ALL the models!
and also lol
I'm scared to update XORG and its drivers
battery
/me facepalms
Tiny Twilight is so tiny.
there's like
I HAVE 2250 MAILS ON DA
Wreky :D
no battery options on linux mint 12
the battery life might have gotten a bit better
But yeah, 0 options
x.x
and mint 12 is hardly configurable
Deleted_dreams: Guess you should clear out your mail more often.
in general
it's annoying
so turn your screen off! :D
I want to go back to linux mint 9/10
where things weren't broken as hell
I have close to 10,000.
ever since mint moved off gnome 2
things have gotten worse
Maybe by Mint 15, they'll fix enough things to make it decent again
well
Meanwhile: BUT I DUN LIKE JUST CLICKING THROUGH FOR 3 HOURS
Because the brony group on dA adds stuff like every .5 seconds.
cinnamon, MGSE, MATE, etc. are still relatively new
cinnamon, at least
FillyFlam: Oh my goodness
Never tried MGSE
Mate is superstable
I don't like MGSE
I haven't really tried Mate
But never seemed to be able to customise it
also my touchpad on here keeps dying
hmmm
also for some reason mint has unity on it too
unity X_X
The music stopped O_O
Laser in...
OH NO
I used it for 5 minutes
then gave up
that happened to me too
>.>
it's horrible
hi
it randomly installed itself on Mint 12
unity >__________>
yeah
05ä*
cus' ubuntu
mint is based off ubuntu
Läser in...
thank goodness Mint 13 doesn't have anything else but cinnamon/mate
which uses unity
Ah
Mirju132: Hello :)
I like cinnamon
except for the fact it has like
0 configurable options
I blame myself because I installed ubuntu repos
:c
and also ships with bloody openssl1.0.0
Well, the only configuring I've done is moving stuff around
instead of openssl0.9.8
This music!
I hate openssl 1.0
äõöü
05å
Lazers?
I want my 0.9.8
å
but I can't do that without uninstalling like
500 packages
x_X
INB4 Dependency hell
<_<

õpik
WEEEEE
lol dependency hell
just
no
hohohoho
I have no idea what that symbol I just used was.
äädikas
But I 'aint using it again.
I kinda want to go back
to mint 9
also xchat is broken on mint 12
♥
How broken?
Oh right
Broke for me too

Hey everypony

Allo VerySillyFilly.
Literally broke
is that fixed in 13?
hi
Hello VerySillyFilly
Uh, I never used nick ignore
hi VerySillyFilly ♥♥♥
well not nick ignore
how would you try to do that in Xchat?
Hello VerySillyFilly
yay
it's supposed to not highlight nicks that you specify
Does anyone know of a graphics card I can get for an express slot in my laptop/
O_O
Settings -> Preferences -> Alerts
00,02we need more people, blue has two more players than red
"Nicks not to highlight"
instead of not highlighting, it ignores
Need more?
I just turned my tower off, so NOE, sorry ;c
I did it
spam
spam
spam
00,02more would be good
Does anyone wait for Cadence?
Is she here?
is it illegal to change your IP adress to evade a ban from a site?
I think it broke
Well
:c
want
probably broken
00,02i'm ariscop btw, the very bad scout
I might turn it back on
If you're here, CTCP Version me
yeah
Depeneds whether I can be bothered
00,02CCCP, its not illegal, but it will get you a permban
it ignores you
FAIL
I said spam 3 times
00,02:P
yeah it fails
Phase4: aww
:(
I think it's xchat 2.8.8's fault, not mint's
fixed it
Ah
What? What will get a permban?
I mena
Not fixed
I can't prove it
* removed it *
My wifi is crap
XD
well
I can't prove that it's xchat 2.8.8 and not mint
Does anyone want Princess_Cadence?
i guess i will never post a single thing on /b/ again ;_;
could be mint having a broken repo
/me tests
Pfft.
lol
Pony fortress lol
go ahead change your ip
T is powerful?
Steam isn't working atm. <.<
My IP changes every week randomly
did i just see Rarity?????? WTF?
they will ban you again but you can change it again CCCP
My parents set that up
Rarity?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: okay
WHERE
WTF???
APPLEJACK :D
Can anyone recommend me a decent graphics card that won't bankrupt me?
WHERE
brb
funny people actually get worried about /b/ lol
Heya guys
Heya
Meanwhile: I could do with a look too, I need an express slot one.
Oh hai Chrysalis
XD
What does your desktop look like on Mint?
Since this laptop uses DDR2, I might swap RAMchips so my tower gets 4gb rather than 1
Or screensho
t

Pinkie Pie!
anyhting interesting been happening?
Bye Mirju132.

Oh, back. I am now sparkly clean.:)

I can always check
I know at least they both are DDR2

The thing that got me into the sow wasw Discord.
Nittany_Discord: Flutterguy kind of scares me a little...

My first exposures to FiM were youtube poops :D
/me dusts Meanwhile
GilDash: You cheated. I know you did.
Nittany_Discord: Well, as long as you don't pull a prince-lemon... Oh no, that's his actual name. :D
/me dust Nittany_Discord and Meanwhile
CCCP then do fun-ny stuff ^^

He will always be princess dari to me.
For me? A whole hour on the My Little Pont franchise and the Rainbow Dash combination with "The Offspring".
Nittany_Discord: He tried to destroy all of our retinas yesterday. :D
Irish_Pony: your OC?
:D Best moment was in 173 - I was watching the thing as I ran backwards down the hallway, and having it gain ground everytime I blinked - I was trying to close a door to keep it out - blinked - and locked it in the room with me - I quit after that and played 87B
Nittany, ummm, you okay?
:( like what Invi?
valoreins: eeyup...:)
I actually can't find the Flutterguy video w/o the song at the end.
I'm fine.
The Offspring are one of my fav bands :$
Suit yourself Nittany...:p

Litwick: So now having a girlfriend makes you cool?
Invi: :D

what is Cajeta?
Nittany_Discord: Funny you should say that... I'm ripping St. Anger right now. :D
FlareChaser: Yeah...thats why i dont play TF2... all i do is lose :D
It's pretty much like saying "Yeah right." only more sarcastically.
Invi: can i kill earlier you?
CCCP that works too : D
:D
RaveBrony: well, you just need to get better :3 that game was laggy for me too, didnt get a lot of kills.
Now what to do....
One does not simply stay alive very long in TF2 RaveBrony.
CCCP: wouldnt that cause a paradox
Does Tara Strong have a facebook?
Meanwhile: Oh i stayed alive! Why? I got lost in the map..... :'( Rofl :D
Meanwhile unless you play turtle engie
Now you hopefully get what I'm saying FlareChaser: besides it's unbecomnig of me to brag about something like that.
xmasskills|ded exactly that is the point of the journey ^^
RaveBrony: remember dude, Team Fortress is not about the kills, its about helping your team!
FlareChaser: Meh, nah, im juwst a badie bad at TF2 :P
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Or that damn heavy with the medic who seems to take way less damage than he should.

Irish_Pony: Lemon Curry?
Where was Luna when the Changelings attacked?
Can anyone tell me what time is it now in EDT?
Ouch, did anypony ping me recently? A hair just tried to dominate my body starting with my eye X_x
Where was Luna when the orcs stormed the walls?
napping
So i was afk
changelings are so minor to luna they dont even wake her up
Where was...I may be mixing something up here.
Irish_Pony: well they streamed Faulty Towers once :)

Dan_: BlaxBlue.

Om: Anyway, we settled on Omffee, remember? ;)
Welcome, to the NewDCD University of Top Notch Streaming
09,01let's fix that

GilDash CrazyCherry: You are both so cruel
Om: It's only because we care. :)

You're my hero.
what IS this?

09,01stereo or mono?
NewDCD: Sound is only on one side.

NewDCD, now it's mono
GilDash: I could stand a bit less care.
can anybody find me a good pic for a t-shirt? (rd , aj , derpy or vinyl scratch related)
09,01or in layman's...yeah that's what I needed to know
hmmmmmmmmm
09,01Meanwhile, tell me when it sounds stereo...need to jiggle the cable a bit
13,06GilDash: Color choices on Chatzilla are limited, so this is close.

Lovely music.
Got it :P
that's my cue to leave
09,01hey Jonbun
!ping

Still mono.
Om: We'll just have to wait for the other numbers to come on then, won't we? ;)
Shame my internet is being really slow!
And hey! :)
Nittany_Discord: Oh, the basic HTML colours then?
sorry guize. I like that my streamer does mono, regardless of the side.
What's this...looks like Anime.
And HAI EVERYPONY
it is anime
Onebrony: Yeah, it is....
is this based off of an anime? I would like to watch it
GilDash: T_T i'm not one of your numbers though
NewDCD: Still mono.
09,01let's do the easy solution
Hello Onebrony!

Oh hai Onebrony

LordCelestia: Likewise, I think that's pretty good too. :S
All of the buffers!
Hmmm? For bacon LC?

Actually I am okay with that color scheme

Malavolent: Doesn't ring a bell.
Onebrony: I've seen all the music, I think The Perfect Stallion's my favorite song of Season 2. (IDGAF)
09,01dang
Om: It's much like BlazBlue, made by the same guys.
ooh yeah game night
this is gonna be gud
Canterlot Wedding's music is 2nd
Has anyone here played Guilty Gear?
09,01and I have

Onebrony: OH GOD YES. COCK A DOODLE DOO
Malavolent: Hmm, to be honest. I havent played that many games. I'm one of those situational gamers I guess.

09,01wait
My favorite music in Mlp is BBBFF.
hi everypony !!!
lol Shizuka.
09,01where's the stream?
The full Art of The Dress of S1 is my favorite S1 song..
Shizuka: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
09,01don't tell me it's that behind
LagnaTheStreamedge: round 2 of that weird robot wing lady
09,01damn it
09,01it is : I
Tabitha...is extremely interesting
13http://i.imgur.com/IGWu9.png
I think my favorite song in Season 1 is....ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I dunno. I REALLY DON'T LIKE SO MANY WONDERS. FILLY FLUTTERSHY SCARES ME Sorry, it's one of my least faavorite songs of Season 1.
ok so my fav song actually is love is in bloom :)
ahh its not pre-built teams
awww
Rebeeru.
09,01cursed panamanian internet
LagnaTheStreamedge: The stream is quite behind, that's why you spoiler :D
favorite song in sseason 1...is winter wrap up maybe
Reberru*
so would you say that, as a whole, season 2 was better than season 1?
Woodenfan, Winter wrap was freaking legit sauce....
GET YO ASS WHOOPED!
Full conversion to brony happened when I watched that ep.
On the bright side its not buf-oh never mind it buffered again.
Art of the dress for me
She's good.
dat clone
okay my internet has decided that is a good time to start disconecting
09,01restarting stream
Season 2 song is Smile
did my chat died or is it just quiet?
ouch
i became a brony at episod 1 ... that's all =D
1,3the full-lottery thing is meh imo, but I was outvoted on it
I think Season 2 had more hit-and-miss, but when it hit, it hit HARD. I think it is better than season 1, a hard act to follow in itself
least theres a couple hours before the night starts
Season 2 would be Perfect Stalion I think...
least it gives the mods a chance of winning
SEASON 3 BETTER TAKE THOSE EXPECTATIONS AND RAPE EM
I think i was a brony before i realised it.
hope it's done trolling me by then
1,3have you tried a full restart and router reset Trixie?
Woodenfan, in my opinion, the best expisodes of season 2 are better than the best of season 1 and the worst of season 2 are not as bad as those of season 1, but season 1 is better in the middle field.
i can't imagine season would exist in the future
Discord better come back.
09,01and back
i want to go in this dimension
A derpycentric episode would be cool! (A Derp in the Life, A Derp in the Life, EXIST)
3
season 3
though im half expecting you there to be "random chance" that means there is always a bronysith/flarechaser on each viewer team
lol the autorefresh of my chat died
CrazyCherry: John de Lancie was one of those who confirmed season 3. Means something (he IS the voice of Discord)
discord come back and dj-pon3 defeat him !!!!
epic HUB time
Can't do right now internet iss being use by my brother
Woodenfan: YIPPI YAI YEI!!!!!
11,01If Discord returns or at least appears in a flashback episode....awesome.
I think they should have an episode with the background characters as the stars for a day (not CMC, they were originally going to be a side series)
Woodenfan: <3 oh goodness
Woodenfan: I think he said he will be voicing pony, didn't he?
Nittany_Discord: Can they really have a voice as distinctive as John's and *not* place him as Discord again?
He is Q after all....
Who? John de Lancie? I don't know
Be right back everypony, got to nom for a while.
You don't know who John De Lancie is?
Reberru Two action!!
Do you live in a cave?
Do you eat raw fish?
but for the night event my brother will mysteriously lose his internet connection for about an hour
:V
Do you sacrifice goats to the sun in the morning?
Meanwhile: Read that statement again. :D
Okay then TheRainbowDash see ya later. :3
or more
Meanwhile: In Minecraft yes.
Meanwhile, what does sushi have to do with it?
i think he don't watch star trek
Discord is my favorite villain of the 3, he had a good backstory and actually came CLOSE to taking over Equestria. Chrysalis just trolled with everyone (albeit convincingly)
Har de har har. Sushi raw fish joke. Oh my sides.

See why I say that 2 vs 1 in this sort of gameplay is kind of unfair?
XD
CK|Ded: It does feel unbalanced, yes.
I don't think so.
I just heared John Cleese say "YOU BASTARD!" and now I have hat coffe spilled on me :P
They're not that strong if he doesn't stand between them.
*hot
Kind of hard to avoid, Malavolent. His hits don't appear to affect the doll-like one.
CK|Ded: The doll did seem to have some sort of healthbar.
Ah great it's the sentient sludgeball.
She moves entirely on her own from the looks of it, so it's much too easy to end up in a scenario where he's stuck between them.
CK|Ded: And when is the doll knocked out, it's over.

Erryday ahm Bronystatin.

INFERNO DIV-ision
flutter_spin: thats across mine entire fanfic. not one chapter

well its my 'written expression'. Ideas flow through my head and in my sleep and I just spam it all on paper and edit it later

8-bit ponies are awesome! :)
Then its 2 weeks of editing.

Ponies47: everything 8-bit is awesome
Ponies47: except E.T
hazama is hax.... >_<
cachi01: eeyup and eeyup
Whats the years difference between you, Bronysith and your bro?
09,01E.T. wasn't 8-bit though
09,01I'm sure the 2600 was less than 8-bit
Gaming night in 11 minutes?
flutter_spin: one is 2 years older. and the other is 6 years. matt is 20 and andrew is 24. matt is the one with sugary treats

Ofcourse you cant, we understand
What game is this?
blazblue
continuum shift 2 i think
08,01Bronysith: nay, good sir
08,01better hook up with John de Lancie.
Q?
yes
or discord
q or discord
DISCOOOORD
GilDash: You keep using that :D I do not think it means what you think it means.
08,01GilDash: it's common knowledge that we're trying to get him to the UK convention
BRB EVERYPONY i have to make a deposit in the national bank of the porcelain
AKA A SHIT TAKING
hai GilDash
lol
09,01Sith, that was uncalled for
Its odd that I don't picture John as Q or Discord. I picture him as the voice I hear which reminds me of the personality he portrayed
kay
Lighty?
are you here
The one time I need the wall-of-text chat intro message, it doesn't come up...
08,01flutter_spin: so, um, Q or Discord?
God I want the entirety of mane chat to get hit by a bus right now.
flutter_spin: DisQord
because ?
Ya
Because I'm in a bad mood.
I will say that my favorite of all is when Q summoned the mexican band on the bridge. So I say Q
I need to watch Star Trek
Yes you do.
Star Trek is best pony.
http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1310671996285.jpg
lol
I love some of the music in Chrono Trigger
Second would have to be the Peter Pan incident when Picard was Robin Hood and Q said "This woman is very clever. I see why you like her so much"
Poni is best pony
lol Peter Pan.. Robin Hood
fair enough i guess
Meanwhile: Never really was a fan of Star Trek
My mom just walked in. Got distracted

Dan: A miserable little pile of pixels.
DIE Dan_ U DONT BELONG TO THIS WORLD
SHED.MOV was pretty good imo

You know what? I feel like taking a bubble bath... right now.
Enough talk, have at you!
Shed.mov was amusing.
/me zips his lips
all the MOVS are good imo
MAGIC.MOV was complete shite though.
Shed.MOV was better than Dress.MOV
Nittany_Discord: He's just being a dumb(squee
)
MAGIC.MOV was good but too long
yeah
I liked Magic.mov
0,5BACON.MOV is best mov
^
PUNCH!

party.mov looks pretty good so far
DRESS.MOV is underrated
MANDOWS.MOV
Bacon is meh.

SPIKE.MOV
cachi01: how can you say that
Meanwhile: :o

Spike.mov wasen't that good it was just for April Fools
CrimsonPhoenix: there will be a simpsons parody
Meanwhile: why must you be such a British Troll??

Reckoning?
38 Studios made Kingdoms of Amalur, if anyone wasn't clear on that.
They had huge money issues
Big Huge Games did Rise of Nations.
Kingdoms of Amalur?

I don't know what these games are.
I don't wanna talk about it...
D'oooh, Acelps isn't here. :C
Gunthler: PM?
Reckoning was sort of ... well a mix between Torchlight style and Skyrim
CCCP: PM.
Skyrim with a lot more clicking or Torchlight with dragons?
Gunthler: wut?
I knew they had money issues, but shutting down wasn't on my mind
It was their first game. It was good, but they...well, yeah. Took out too much money on loan thinking they'd sell the 3 million copies they needed to make it back.
CCCP: PM me if you wanna know.

Ponies47: yes :)
kingdom of amalur is amazing
Uh, yeah, Ponies47.
Oh ZP reviewed it? I must've heard of it then. But it must not have stuck very well in my mind.
3 million copies for the -first- title of a new company? Uhm...no. Good to have goals, but that's setting yourself up for failure.

A bit too much RD if you ask me
02SS, y you have net in your domain name but use the TLD .org?
FlareChaser: They are in my heart, celebrities.

That's why I get around it by mentally switching the number back to $20.

I always found 20 to look prettier, so I want to buy that more

Chrysalis: Technically....there's a way for NetOps to do it.
Vivix: nope, becuase its too complicated
I am going to...
Maybe it just glitched-
Have to go to bed...
There's ops on another IRC network I frequent who can do that. Though they generally don't. >.>

DashWithRainbows: Considering how often the mods play and how good some of 'em are? They're not doing that awful honestly. :P
alexxm: Nah~ Each mutation is centered around what the human did before they got infected~ Spitters are too much product or makeup~

I think that we should love and tolerate and watch the freaking L4D game.
CK|Ded: exactly.

Shamroc: well... im honest... and I honestly love you ^^

BETS TAKING ALL BETS!!!!
Aha! It lives!!

For a second I thought there was a wasp in my headset.

07The first time I went to Rome was for the Easter mass last year

Meanwhile: that would suck
I'd like to stay, but I have to watch the BronyCon stream, so I'll catch you guys afterwards! :)
Bronysith: 5 bits says Midnight dies first.
07Hmmm

Oh look at that~ 5 hours go fast

Fact
11,01fluttercry: Are you going to try and return?
GabeMoist: havent heard that one before
Wheres the rainbow D:
13i was going to try and save the bot
Welp, the mods are only down 30, so that's recoverable pretty easily. Having the bot doesn't make that easier though.
05,15I'm working on it
13had the adrenaline and pipe to cover myself
I wish to dip Diamond Tiara in frosting and throw her at a wasp nest.
13but nooooooope bot too dumb to live
Shizuka: One does not simply go back for the bot.
Yup
Shizuka: thats the point...bots dont get to live
Bots usually are too dumb to live.
I missed movie night...who won the lottery?
Cant wait til season 3 :D:D
Bots have all the survival instincts of a chip sandwich.
GabeMoist Diamond Tiara is a spoiled bitch who always tries to get her way and shoves around anypony who she believes to be lower than her social standard; she's a bureaucrat
Meanwhile: but those things last forever!

Canadian_Brony: You're welcome. Just about the only thing I'm good at is reminding you of obscure internet references you had long since forgotten or wanted to forget.
CK|Ded: OH NO! XD

I hate this area.
RARITY.
So difficult to actually sneak up on the survivors unless they are dumb.

11,01Having a bot is a heavy handicap.
It really is.
XAX: I WANT!
Nittany_Discord do you want a 4th?
Bots are so random. :/
Or is it uncool because I don't rock an @?
XAX are they custom? Cuz I want to find out where I can get a pair. I am in desperate need of some new ones
Meanwhile. Toootally uncool.
Thought so.
11,01We probably will.
You need at least a + to be cool.
Canadian_Brony: They are a pair of Phillips headphones that you can change the pictures on the side of. I just printed out a picture of RD's cutie mark, cut it in a circle, and stuck it in the side.
Nittany_Discord: whos that 4th you guys got?
Shamroc: Jaketehsnake.

XAX that is bucking sweet. For my birthday, I'm hoping for a universal TV remote, a phone for downstairs, a TF2 Grenadier's Softcap, some new headphones, and a Rainbow Dash t-shirt
One does not simply ring the doorbell of Mordor.
XAX and cash, of course
dem presents
Canadian_Brony: i have a rainbow dash t-shirt ( with her cutie mark tho)
that would be lucky as hell
You'll have to kill the users really early in this match to stay alive, mods. The bot's really hurt. ._.
Om: Are you there, Omffee? :)

I don't think they've got any bots anymore CK|Ded.

Good evening!

(in other words i am a rice cake)
er
i mean
Marx where?

Canadian_Brony: hm. its hard to find.. i couldnt find any pony related t-shirts here in Greece so i made one... there is a place called stampa house where u can make a t-shirt with a picture you want
nom nom nom
in a field of pumpkins
Irish_Pony: Sorry, Irish. I've been attending to the BBQ for most of the night. :$
filled with gasoline

that was the wrong building!
... yeah
SORRY GUYS XD
GilDash: No sweat... *kisses*
0,14 Calm down there
/me snuggles Irish_Pony.
Irish_Pony: No more distractions now at least. ;)
I hear the sound of an emo.
GilDash: Good ;)
She mad

Nice boom

maybe I should get both . . .
LOL

Canadian_Brony: online market? im interrested in buying one too xD
dat pipebomb
is me when overtired
lawl
lol
Meanwhile: It's *2* letters. :D
but also then some could argue that since a rice cake can't get tired
GilDash: Still faster :P
that i'm just speaking nonsense
Canadian_Brony: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/567/Massimo.jpg
but then again
dead things can't speak
but nah they cant deliver it here
i can just sit here
I would like to get a really neutral looking MLP T-Shirt, where you don't actually see directly ponys. But i think i really would like a chrysalis shirt
and be delicious
whilst you use the wrong sauce
IT'S NOT SPICY ENOUGH
shame on youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Meanwhile: Ah, but it took me 10 seconds to figure it out. With someone in my mindset thats forever. :D
GilDash: I'm sure you're faster than you think ^^
Meanwhile: Not tonight I'm not. :D
/me paints go faster stripes on GilDash's face.
Man, this isn't going well for the mods.
also
why are you so
\o/
silent
it's not fun
o-o
i must apply MORE TEA LEAVES
Meanwhile: This stuff isn't toxic... right? :S
Probably.
what did i walk in on
Onyxia the only problem is their both $25 and I'm 14. I would out-grow both shirts really quickly. One option would to get them in a size bigger than my actuall size so I don't out-grow them too quickly
i'm just having a monologue
lol
Flare is still here
No one asked :P

Canadian_Brony: i see .. im 16 tho .. almost 17

Kinda
Nittany_Discord: He sort of did it as a joke in one game. He's a good guy really. :D
Likes chocolate
But the key is to rush as a unit.
I *really* wish I had a PC for all this fun. :')
11,01People that rush and leave the rest of the team to die.
:'(
lol
11,01Meanwhile's right. Rushing together works.
If you rush without your team you may as well cover yourself in mayonaisse and garnish yourself with lettuce because you gonna be a sandwich.

Dat charge
05,15-_-
11,01It was bad in Alien Swarm at the lower levels. You'd get one person that would run through the level and leave the rest of the team to die.

Hey Everypony
Shizuka well if something was tough to me by plantz vs zombies is that peashooters are good

GilDash: I don't know if it would stop you if you didn't.
But there's usually a delay on the stream anyway
NICE!
Windowed game?

actually nittany what they see in game and what they see on stream is delayed
you'd probably be watching something that happened 30 or so seconds ago.
Good job Nittany_Discord
Om: Probably not. :D

11,01I was joking Derpy_Hooves

GilDash: I didn't even know what the conversation was about
FlareChaser: Now who's bad? :p
Litwick: In this game, viewers.
Om: I'm sure you could figure it out. ;)
GilDash: wasnt me
AGGGH
blizzard
bronysith: blizzard?
GilDash: But would I want to?
Deadeagle: blizzard
bronysith: like company or weather?
company
mfw i spend alot of time to make my on thread on pony chan and it doesn't work
own*
i like their games. hate their customer support
XD heh weather...
Blizzard is the best Company :|
FlareChaser: valve is better
Om: Now, that's debatable. :D
I like Blizzards customer support.
Looks like kirz took a right pounding there.
Bronysith: derp, I forgot about valve :P
-if you know what I mean.
Nah, Interplay. :D
GilDash: I would rather it not be.
NOPE. chuck testa
OWNED
Blizzards customer support was never bad for me.
i like nintendo when they make games with mario and zelda
chuck testa is best
i only really trust blizzard and valve nowadays to produce high quality games
and users win the second game!
Om: In that case, yes, yes you do want to know. ;)
i dont like them when they make games like wii play
I can't wait for the new Supe Smash Bros.
^
GilDash: Damn loopholes -_-
omg headache!
i didn't think the wii was revolutionary
The wii was a step backwards. Off a bridge.
Meanwhile: Wrong
it wasn't that bad
Without WII we wouldn't have kinect
Bronysith: I know so I ahve to buy the Wii U only for that and maybe for some ohter games too
Meanwhile: it was a swan dive into a pool filled with razor blades
it just wasn't that good
05,15I got really far across that bridge
Vordox: Kinect is a step backwards off a bridge into a ditch.
A ditch full of hooker corpses.
Meanwhile: and razors
Vordox: It looks good but I don't have a PS3
kirzstryfe: go get your food we can wait..
Meanwhile: Wrong again, it was a reinsertation
Reinsertion*
heh... made you fall off a ledge fluttercry, it was fun
I feel like a frikken god. Such a good feeling
/me pats fluttercry on the head
Vordox: A reinsertion of walking backwards off a bridge.
Meanwhile: You can only advance equipment, if the equipment sells nowadays
MOTION GAMING CANT WORK
Om: Give me a loophole to play with and it'll be a lot bigger than you thought it could be. ;)
i would be a PC gamer if i had a good PC
Meanwhile: No, its like the powerglove upgrdaded. :P
What Bronysith said.
05,15That was fun, I would have got to the plane if you hadn't jockyed me
Motion controls are a waste of time.
Bronysith: It can, and it will.
Meanwhile: i agree
Vordox: wrong answer is wrong
fluttercry: maybe, you still would've had to deal with the tank though
Nittany_Discord: yeah... take a break
Bronysith: It will, it can, and it's not far off. Maybe 5-10 years
GilDash: e_o The implications of what you said disturbs me.
11,01We're going to.
Hiya guys....
wii sports was fun for 30 mins
Vordox: add 4 zeroes to each number. and then possibly
Allo icybeauti.
hi icybeauti

Nittany_Discord: I better be plaaaying neeext!~
Bronysith: Or do a analyze of every single gaming conductivity for the last 100 years, then talk again :P
:3
cccp: yuP!
Dat Random.org
CCCP: But is was the greatest 30 minuets ever
well, for me any ways
but SSBB made up for it biiiig time
Om: What would I be without my implications, hmm? ;)
Can't wait till new Metalocolypes.
If I dont get to play...</3
GilDash: probably banned xD
Bronysith: Human controllers will be an added direction of gaming, and I see alot of uses for it, especially to get into games that does not revolve around certain control diagnostics... So yeah :P
Bye Flutterguy
11,01Intermission.
dat Rainbow Dash menu
Vordox: but gaming on the pc with a mouse and keyboard is better than flailing around like an idiot
Nittany_Discord: okkidokkilokki
11,01May cut stream for a bit if the weather worsens.
Well I'm putting music on.
Om: Okay, that's a fair point and well made. :D
Vordox: and if i wanted to sword fight. id go outside and swing my sword
Bronysith: I said, depending on control diagnostics. ><
Vordox: or go out and shoot a gun
Hope it stays alright Nittany_Discord.
I WISH it wud storm where i live -_-
Nittany_Discord: You've FFVII on the PC too? <3
Bronysith: Some games work, some does not.

Litwick: ? :D

icybeauti: Lucky! I just get some light rain and then it goes away :'(
cachi01: Nah, it's decent for once, not the top notch of what it can be yet, but give it time.
GilDash: So.
icybeauti: its thundering and raining?
