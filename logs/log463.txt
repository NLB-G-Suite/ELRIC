We atre just SPIES!
And all?
:D
What....:D
*hears
Hehehehe...
If Gen 5 was bad, Famitsu wouldn't have rated it 40/40
Hai :3
02UI Isn’t even a proper word to use in gaming
Just saying
They had a touch screen in Gen 4, and they wasted it completely, using it for gimmicks
I MISSED YOU TAB BUTTON!
04opinion
Don't get me wrong. Gen 4 was cool for introducing online battles, trading, and Lucario
04all's said and done
05ill see if i cant try
and I'm just stating plain fact
*coughOnlyTwoFireTypeLinesInSinnohCoughsoughsough*
Afterwords
Well, his hating of Gen 5 is based on opinion
04so
04eXAKR
But mine's backed with FACTS
04You dislike gen 4?
Not exactly, in the end
I like all the gens
Just felt Gen 4 was a huge disappointment given how revolutionary it could have been
Which Gen 5 was
04[21:23] <eXAKR> Horrible music <- opinion
04[21:23] <eXAKR> With horrible towns and cities <- opinion
I also liked Gen 2 and Gen 3
02opinion^
Hahaha:D
02[05:23] <eXAKR> Horrible variety
02[05:24] <eXAKR> Horrible UI

02opinion
Hello
If the music was good, they wouldn't have used near-identical music for Gym Leaders and E4 battle
04...
It's already a fail on their part
04That
04just
And it's not as if they were limited or something, like Gen 2
04means
04doesn't
Quite good. And you?
04eXAKR using the same music for two types of battle doesn't make the music bad
We need. More Cowbell
OK, how about some of the route music?
04eXAKR
Some of it didn't fit the route at all
OK.
:)
04so you'll be as bad as him?
04rather
And that actually made me stop even looking at them
04you'll be as "allegedly" bad as him?
02every time*
Yeah
04Yes
If he hates it, then tell him to stop
04Because that solves EVERYTHING
*stop
Good, I'll add that into the sprite then
Not sure. Probably
Again, my request is simple
Or GTFO
02me*

don't think there's a mare he hasn't drawn...
I'
Is that aboy, or a girl?
FECK
?
Well, uh... Still havent gotten a badge yet :$
wild*
I still remember that
02no, he shouldn't be, but there's nothing wrong with him stating that he doesn't like it
ooooo
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 14 time(s).
Oh thank god...Finally.
02you don't?
Would Aladeen approve?
Never
02hurr
Not even in my signature
And I know he's watching
To be honest, I won't shed a tear if he dies tomorrow
02..
02okay
02now
04yeah that's really extreme
02that is just
02yeah
Now let's see how he likes that
04so
04eXARK
04You're intentionally saying that to provoke him?
He has said a lot of provocative things
Done a lot of provocative actions
To make us all hate him
04You're intentionally riling him up, "giving him a taste of his own medicine" based on the fact that you think he might be watching?
02He’s not a “hater” he just has strong opinions like a lot of people.
Strong opinions doesn't entitle you to rub it in other's faces
I'll choose between that and Warhead.

:D
<3
XD
but yeah
http://i.imgur.com/dTl0X.jpg
13 is out
I want to get it
I dont even know wtf that came from
Dist upgrade should work fine
It's too early!
linux mint
Well...
No.
basically, upgrading is reinstalling the entire f*cking system
Yes
and doing it via apt is crappy
Okay, fine.... Go eat each other's ear then. -_-
Its based on ubuntu/debian, and they forgot to kang the upgrade system?
cus' it layers
instead of replacing everything
(nibbles on Ninjazz's ear)
Wowww
O_O
it's like a system gnome-shell
xD
Hahaha:D
means I need to backup my data
Mints more retarded than i though then
-_-
install mint 13
05ahem
then move everything back on
well i go and sleep night everypony
Even Ubuntu can dist upgrade
x_X
:(
ubuntu is crap though
*eats all TheRainbowDash's ties*
and are you using arch or something?
My ties? why?
oh wait
debian
with gnome 2?
xfce
Have you tried apt-get dist-upgrade
that
Do you even wear ties?
No?
I'm a goat, baaa
Ummm, no, not at all.
Unless mint is really retarded
no lol
It should set the system to upgrade to a newer version
I did dist-upgrade earlier
dist-upgrade updates the kernel version on mint
/me backflips onto the ceiling
like linux-generic-headers linux-headers etc.
Calculating upgrade... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Guess... I'll just wait here.
that
lol
Whaaatttttt
the only reason why I'm using min
(drops the ceiling down onto the floor, 100 feet below)
mint
is because of the interface
-_-
otherwise I'd use debian with xfce
or gentoo even
:P
but I can't deal with emerge
well
you can do the apt-get method
Thats <censored> stupid
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 103 time(s).
but as I said
instead of installing it
it's like a system gnome-shell
/me slids across wooden floor in underwear
Yeeehh

(removes the flooring)
With sunglasses?
HELLL YEAH!
05no rp you two
which is silly
and I don't want that
Damn it.
Aww....:<:D
Alright.
I dont see why they b0rked dist upgrade
>_>
idk either
Yeah, rping is illegal, you know!
Idiots
I get it.
and move it down to something like 2GB
:$
instead of 8GB
LVM! :D
also
You mostly need 1:1 swap if you want to suspend
lol
x_x
Hopefully.
I haven't used standby
ever
I never use standby
on mint
Then you dont need 1:1 swap
is anyone even streaming? or is it just random music XD
I've had bad experiences with standby
>_>
on my old laptop
Its a pita
if I put it on standby while on the charger
and then unplug the charger
If you have iffy drivers
The random music is the stream.
As well as ponies!

which I then had to get replaced
Not*

00,02Vordox it seems
I have 2 I think
<3 LVM
...my country's Cartoon Network is showing Total Drama Island.
Waaaa
I should repartition
I've seen it
and have /home as a separate partition
And frankly, it sucks
Yes, yes you should
without needing to do that backup and move
except that's a bit painful
05brb
how much should I need for /
My / is 8gig atm
Aye.
fair enough
I don't think I'd need more than 10GB for / anyway
Gnome would use another gig
As I said, LVM
Say it.
Its really easy to add moar
-_-
:3
I'm waiting for myself to play all Key's "dating sims"
Nvm
I'm far to lazy to set LVM up x_X
Nothing worth bothering about
I think I'll probably only need /, /home and swap
Mint installer cant do LVM?
>_<
idk
I haven't tried LVM
on mint
Yeah, that is why I didn't do anything.
noted.
and I haven't used LVM for ages
I am scared.
Mhhm
Yes
I think /, /home and swap
We need to giggle and laugh them out of here, when they enter.
:)
or I could have /var as well
but that's a bit redundant
Meh, I would just do / /home and swap
tonight: dd or lol? :P
As soon as I see ghosties' text I imagine dripping blood.
night all
I could also do /dev
the rain destroyed my books
but that's lame
Bah

05looking at the keyboard
Typing without one letter is not easy
05it seems like repairing it would require some finesse
My keyboard is anything but clean...
05if you remove the faulty button there should be a rubber surface udnerneath that is the actuall button
05a knob per se
oh
05now if this blob is not coming back up when pushed down, or needs to be pushed down hard
05you need to repair the rubber thingy which is hard
Push hardddd
05otherwise if its the feathering of the plastic that is borked
05jsut get a spring in there
Accidentally learning.

05Lil_B: apparently he didnt have anotehr keyboard/could afford one
I can push it all the way. Just have to push and hold to get ti to type, then it types a string of letters.

How remove the key?
05depends on the keyboard

I think that's enough of that script for now.
I think i finally found out why I'm most productive during the night. I think I need some kind of deadline to do work
OK.
I don't get Toonami till a week after it airs in the US.
aw
Not a good sign...
I think a deadline makes me more nervous. I tend to be productive if I have a cheerleading squad
Someone ping me when they are choosing the peeps for L4D2 please.

Here's a tip for you, Toonami: Just making shows that normally occupy that block is pretty lazy. BLEACH SHOULDN'T BE ON TOONAMI, DAMMIT
I have L4D2, but I don't know how good I am

Yeah, I didn't like Code Lyoko growing up, and I don't like it now. Avatar, the last Airbender, on the other hand, was great. Keep that up.
But if you want to "watch" something, that works

Pfft.
05Phase4
I'll bbl goin job hunting.
I'm going wtf at it
Hello?
:D SUDDENDLY BECAME LUNA
hai
I have a feeling that they made the graphics performance WORSE
In this release
:3
x_X
Possibly, not exactly sure yet
05Phase4
Well
05Phase4
in this
:D
taskbar flashing doesn't work
weird as it works for me
sorta
sometimes on-hover descriptions break and stay there until I restart
but the battery hasnb't changed other than
and I can't change screen brightness
That'd be rockin.
:D
a really useful battery bar in the menu
and fglrx is such a pain
intel radeon
Intel HD 2000 works perfectly for me
it's not the graphics card's problem
and fglrx breaks it
Download ALL the models!
and also lol
I'm scared to update XORG and its drivers
battery
/me facepalms
there's like
I HAVE 2250 MAILS ON DA
But yeah, 0 options
x.x
and mint 12 is hardly configurable
it's annoying
I have close to 10,000.
ever since mint moved off gnome 2
things have gotten worse
Maybe by Mint 15, they'll fix enough things to make it decent again
well
cinnamon, at least
Never tried MGSE
Mate is superstable
I don't like MGSE
I haven't really tried Mate
But never seemed to be able to customise it
also my touchpad on here keeps dying
hmmm
also for some reason mint has unity on it too
unity X_X
The music stopped O_O
Laser in...
OH NO
I used it for 5 minutes
then gave up
that happened to me too
>.>
it's horrible
hi
it randomly installed itself on Mint 12
unity >__________>
yeah
05ä*
cus' ubuntu
mint is based off ubuntu
Läser in...
thank goodness Mint 13 doesn't have anything else but cinnamon/mate
which uses unity
I like cinnamon
except for the fact it has like
0 configurable options
I blame myself because I installed ubuntu repos
instead of openssl0.9.8
This music!
I hate openssl 1.0
äõöü
