9BANISHMENT TO THE MOON PUNCH! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQgHIbF-U
I just sent a friend that doesn't like ponies this link cause he LOVES MECHA
It's a shame Megas XLR isn't bigger universally because I would kill to see Megas in one of these games
youd think they would want to shoot for the chest in an attempt to take out the pilot
Megas in SRW would be FUCKING EPIC
They're showing Megas tommorrow
slurpee
9TRANS-AMU!
TRANS AM!

DA MAGICS!
04How much time do you put in to spriting each day?

/me is still waiting for Talgeese :P
Especially Thundercats
SHOW TIME!!
I had a co worker we called big-O

wooooooO!Wooooo! Wooooo! Sparklely!
not robotech
9that was Dancougar
04lol
04Just wondering really
Nanoha should be in this, she is praticaly a gundam herself.
this is a gundam seed right?
04It usually takes me 40 minutes to make a sprite, but then I procrastinate alot
9aka BEST GUNDAM SERIES
9don't confuse it with SHIT and SHIT Density
SECOND BEST
Nanoha isn't gundam-sized
TURN A
lol
*TURN A IS BEST
I resent that. Seed is great.
Seed was last gundam I ever saw... sorry.
that adds to time as well
9well
9SEED was decent
Here comes ZERO
this pleases me
I should probably practice scratching more
9but it became the shittiest shit on SHIT Density
9Assram was just as bad
Pfft, everyone knows Zeta is the best. /UCElitism
0I'm sensing some hostility
and actual effort that I don't enjoy in any way at all ewww
/me casually inserts Talgeese reference because he can
Clearly, you're forgetting about G Gundam
2
this hand of mine.
*Brohoofs ValtheJean*
04Heh
9and Z is best UC
Turn A>X>Victory>G>Wing>Z>MSG>ZZ
/me Brohoofs Kaempfer
04I could never do art/spriting for work.
04I'm extremely fickle about when I want to do it
Turn A looks pretty gay
the mobile suit I mean
these are the best scratches I've ever made
and they're not even that good

9well
9cockpits are usually at chest level in mechs
9unless you're Jehuty, in which you are in the crotch
9the head is basically an overglorified optical/signal sensor
Or Dolores
or Turn A - crotch
Turn A's more of a Belt Buckle
but wouldn't it make sense to put the most important person in the harder to hit area?
most armore
I never did understand Kojima's knowledge of mecha anatomy
I mean...the chest isn't exactly the hardest part of the machine to hit
*armored
9you should aim for the body
and isn't the Sazabi's cockpit in the head as well?
9well consider the fact that
kinda reminds me of Kalinin from Full Metal Panic
I guess
oh damn I forgot about fmp mechs.
9also the cockpit might be there
9it pwns
9I also have Bonta-kun and his attacks are hilarous
ok here one why do thay call it a cockpit?
Cuz only dudes were supposed to be there
because of the nature of pilots?
lol

Yall seen the explaination about Spiderses on EqD?
7Well, I just found out that Europe resembles Kyurem.
Dermathil,what are you talking about?
o.o
we're making this confusing
HL:FLC?Awesome!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/spiderses-dramatic-live-reading.html#more
Spiderses is an horrible fanfiction.
Probably the one that was worst written
(orthographically)
It is HL:FLC levels of bad writing.
And there is already a dramatic reading of it
.____________________.
Okay.
By a lightyear.
04gnight everyone
):
:(
Barry,never mention that fic again.
wow, that was fast
Fail at writing Twilight's name in the first paragraph, example;
Drake's quit message is more interesting than kyurem
D=
lol
Kyurem?
How about worse than My Immortal?
Resembles Europe?
what's that?
o.o?
There must be
A PATTERN
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
no, Europe resembles Kyuremm.
-m
and then they modeled Europe after it.
ohhhhh
if ($regex($2-,[^abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_.@\s]) == 0) { msg $chan Success! }
why does that not work
listen to it.
The dramatic reading is done HL:FLC style.
HL:FLC!YAY!
My immortal is a very badly written Harry Potter fic
grammar mistakes galore

and of course, I'm an idiot

Am i a spider?

Thanks.
Wait,am i a spider or not?
Hi DMan
I wrote two chapters to my story
Nice
And hi Barry
Do you want to see them?
eeeeNOPE
which one? WW or PR?
PR
lol
WW is still in the works
^_^
But don't worry, I'll get back to it, sometime
KA-BEWM
Sure
DMAN
how are ya
i know
Did ya listen to the dramatic reading of Spiderses?
Good, good. Came back from my run not too long ago, t'was nice :3
It is HL:FLC levels of awesome.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
it is more than a fanfic. It is an EXPERIENCE
It's stupid.
Did you get the PM?
Just got back - people mid siesta - i'll plug it into our hugeass soundsystem in an hour or 2
Dermathil,somewhat stupider than FLC.
I'm afraid of reading Spiderses just because of how hyped it is
Getring close to my destination
I mean, that's a lot to live up to.
Gtg, bye! =D
Last time i got hyped for something,it was Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen.And we all know how much it sucks!
:P
Wait,i got hyped for something else after that.It was Kick-Ass.And that was awesome.
Rarity is best pony
12Angel ~
FreezeFrame,umad?
13Latté~
goodnight
goodnight
Nah, all of the mane six are awesome
Rarity is just the best of the best.
I just found out "pronounciation" isn't a word.
/me mind = blown
In my opinion,Rarity is the worst of the six.
7ProNUNciation. :3
13Lol it's pronunciation
13xD
THIS IS NEWS TO ME D:
and goodnight
06:3
but STILL THIS IS NEWS TO ME
13It's ok, I always used to think that dependent was spelled as 'dependant" up until recently |D
lol
It always bothers me when people confuse -ant and -ent endings
like spelling existent as "existant"
Dman, spiderses can't be explained in words.
13Independent and Dependent are the only two words I got mixed up with xD
It is too special for that to be possible.
I can explain Spiderses in a word.
And that word is.....stupid.
SHHHHH
Right behing you.
I never had many problems with spelling things
but pronunciation I'd have just never guessed XD
*behind
because you don't pronunce things, you pronounce them
wtf english language :(
/me throws his jarate behind him.
/me dodges the backstab.
AAAAAAAH!PISS IN MY FACE!

OW!
(aka DOT MINICRITS)
for some reason the stream kicked me out a million times yesterday
i was on the road
/me is bleeding
that's because Dari setup a chatcap
11Either Dari or the server itself.

Doubting it is the server.
We could reach 250 before

Gotcha

I get an ad to visit Israel.
I doubt it is religion-related.
Barry - sent request for part 2 of fanfic
thanks barry. Also, 'dman@derpymail.org' is the mail I use the most :P I just have it and a few others hooked up to my gmail one
(just incase you wanted to know. I don't mind which you use, should you use one, but i'm sure it's more fun to type '@derpymail.org' than '@gmail.com' :P)

What's going on
/me lowers his sword besides him, his face showing signs of discombobulation
*sigh*, ok then, shuffle all ya want then, but don't scare me like that unless it's an emergency!
/me puts his sword away, and walks from the road to a nearby bench, sitting on it.
Ohgod.They're moving towards me!
/me speaks lazily, without raising his head, due to disbelief.
Oh really now?

/me looks up, through his hair

Entering the kiddie pool, watch for yellow clouds.
Just tell him to put it on Ponychan.

I know, but it sounded like you said it had bad special effects mib_rwov4i

But if they have lots of lead and can turn it into uranium, couldn't they just use a transmutation circle to get it done faster instead of triangular laz0r screens?

plot
Trollity
they've had 2 failed MMOs, and 12 and 13 were utter shit
I watch it for the plot
FOREVERRRR
or is it Raritroll?
Rarity is best pony
dat digging
12 wasn't that bad
0egh...egh..uhhh..
But FF10 was good, Val
4I watch it...for the whining
Raritroll works
FF12 was fine. Just less bitchy characters.
oh I agree
DAT FAIL DIGGING
hence why 10 was the end of FF
but 12 was shit
Balancing was shit in FF12, though.
She's not actually failing, blocks
You just need to pay attention to the story, since it wasn't easy to follow
for a second there, i thought he was going to say "oh fuck godness"

6MARSHMALLOW EVERYWHERE

poor rarity
This episode is awesome
rarity is racist against mules
Mallow from SMRPG kinda sucked
It's all an act.
Rarity at her best
SOYLENT MARSHMALLOWS ARE PONIES
Remember Rarity wasn't offended by having her butt slapped. Only by being called a mule.
Hey LLotS
she never dies, and has infinite healing powers
inb4 Fuck 'em up
Metal Luna is perpetually screwed anyway given that its population sucks balls

The confederacy fought to END slavery. Applejack is the best pony.

0AJ + Twilight + Pinkie for president
or well, I stopped before WotLK was even finished.
Twilight for President, Pinkie Pie for Secretary of Stat
haven't seen Arthas, don't care.
it was a really fun fight
the cinematic at the end was lame
but the fight mechanics were solid
Rainbow Dash for President
*nostalgia sigh* I remember my first LK down...

if I had L4D2, I'd totally suggest you stream it while we play :P
7you should totally get it

unfortunately I blew most of my "non-college fund" money on League of Legends >.<
7err..did you buy champs
stupid LoL being my gateway to stop the WoW addiction...
skins <.< >.>
and champs...
7errr..
/me 7nods
:(
though I also got the additional rune pages
that was a really practical buy
I'd suggest some hardcore SP playing
7I quit LoL already
oki gonna idle till night of the liveing robots.
well, because you can't get skins with IP :P
I'm a skin addict
I mean champs
0so I heard LoL was similar to DotA
0what would you pay for?
7it is
also theres exp boosts
and it was just cost effective to get the skin pack
thats how they get ya
7micro transactions ftw..
on the plus side
7even aoc got it
7and they make tons of money on it
I spend SIGNIFICANTLY less on LoL than I do on WoW
always ends up costing more
oh it's great for the publisher, no doubt.
7miss fortune I loved her :( until she got nerfed to the ground
7then I quit :D
she's still really solid
I main her
well...I main like half the champions
but still
she is still a very solid carry
When I used to play I used Amumu
and ever since the Corki nerf, she's right up there again
it's a shame they ruined Noc and Yorick...they were my favorites

I don't have a Blu-Ray player

Homestuck seems like a lot of work to get into
Aradia
I have no Blu-Ray drive either
I have no plans to buy one either
Elky: its totally worth it
I do
no movies on the format interest me much
elky, oh yes it is, but worth it if you can get into the story.
which is why I'm not really keen on getting into it
hm
The format doesn't interest me at all
not sure if I have the needed free time
rent BD for $1, copy/watch, yeah
STUPID COMPUTER! Y U TAKE MY MASS SPOTS???
i dont care for eather of those things

Guys, Suited for Success was meant as a Take That to Executive Meddling, did you know that?
Animal Planet?
I'm just thinking
and just realized
Aang is a fucking selfish cunt
I can see why it would be interpretted as such...but I didn't get the feeling the executive board was THAT meddlesome
at least, they were certainly less meddlesome than pretty much ANY other show
Sometimes they are
I mean with how the others pressured Rarity into making the dresses the way they wanted
well Faust commented a lot on how they were very workable
Right
or rather gain common sense
ooookay, gotcha
04Oh, is our time for character-bashing already?

9so kids

9did you like the movie?
@Darken same man, it was a kickass show
I enjoyed it
1 2 3 4
slowly getting louder
it was kind of dumb
is "Hell yes" an appropriate response?
I can count to 4! =D
I liked it
WHY IS SHE COUNTING?
VAN TOO TDEE FO
That's clearly 5 lines, not 6
1 2 3 4
shutup!
HEY GUYS SHE CAN COUNT TO 4
They're coming to take me away ha ha
They're coming to take me away ha ha
9because of THIS:
They're coming to take me away ha ha
She's practicing her music counting
6There needs to be a kick all option...
BUT I DON'T GIVE A FUCL
*FUCK
she had 4 arms!
I DID NOT GET A SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
Annnnd MUSIC
BUT LOVED IT
LOL ALIEN DRUMMER
because that shit was great
9oh yeah this scene si from the OVA
dat mulet
end war with a song
04o-o
I wish I was here for the start. Twas' a fun watch.
03you aren't?
zentradi always on drums
everypony likes getting kicked
9I might stream Macross Plus and later maybe Frontier
we should watch Intersetller 5555
9not sure if should Zero
why not?
go ahead you mods, kick me
YES
one of my ZNC servers went down
zentradi on drums. dat bass
7Really, my parents don't like each other at all now; the only reason they're together is because of taking care of the house and kids and financially.
No Macross 7?
apparently someone or something killed the process
INTERSTELLA 5555 WOULD BE AWESOME
Macross 7 is utterly gonzo
its like Across the Universe but cooler
best credits ever
I never got 7 at all
03do you have siblings?
I tried to watch 7.
TTGL beats the manure out of this and everything else
Macross 7 just wasn't that good
But fuck Basara, seriously.
when i was a kid this was like the greatest thing ever. /sigh
6she wasnt LOL
TTGL is good, but not the be-all-end-all
04hey Roara~
yes PP
9kay back
mecha wise it does it 4 me
9skip credits?
WB
0Gurren Lagann is easily my favorite Mecha anime
No credit-skipping
9Gurren Lagann was a GREAT tribute, but it's not the greatest thing ever
my favorite movie as a kid was fox and the hound, i think
I bet two
/me shot
TTGL is awesome, but you don't always want PURE HOT-BLOODEDNESS
FULL METAL PANIC?
9because in Z all of the Valks have the same attacks
That poor fox :(
I disagree
How about gunbuster 2 if you want random.
because SDF1 = greatest capital ship ever
I have a Wave Veritech model that I should work on while I watch this
Baby don't hurt me
Baby don't hurt me
