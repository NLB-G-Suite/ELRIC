Can we watch a stream of something by NIS next time... like Prinny: Can I really be the Hero?
Prinny is very frustrating to watch.
9if you want a NIS game
9I'd go with Zettai Hero Project
Unless the person is hilariously good at the game
9because DAT KAMEN RIDER PARODY
That... looks a lot like wing zero
but me not good at Mecha lore
HOLY SHIT APPLE_BLOOM, you weren't exaggerating... much
so yea whats the lvl cap?
9in this game
yea
9dunno, but you'll never reach it
What are those metal dragons? something from YU-GI-OH
It almost didn't follow the CMCs thoughts any.
Yeah, it's impossible
They're Dimensional Beasts
have you ever played a game with just one mech on its own, getting all the exp?
Cupcakes is... psychologically better, but this sure beat it graphically.
so we talking over 9000?
I love how they're fighting extradimensional horrors and are like 'Meh, NEXT'
Also, why do i have a boner?
Because of the sex?
9dose Haruhiko Mikimoto character designs
HELLO?
9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI

Dammit, Why can't we play as the Dimensional Beasts. They look awesome

And plus, they're baddies
9bloomberg
9how are you typing?
Hey, a Lot of Magic the Gathering fans Loved the New Phyrexia set.
9"Imperier is...Celestia's Being's enemy!"
He is using Cereal's special keyboard for ponies
9but he's a tree

Speech-to-text
Oh wait
What sorta mecha was that?
9that was from Orguss
Uh.... a wizard did it
Hey NewDCD
Did you read the fanfic?
So... Did I miss out on any casualties?
Oh jesus, that is one big mecha
9also: Alpha Gaiden
9â—¦ Took a Level in Badass (EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY Shinji Ikari, who goes from the whiny brat he was in the series in the first game to a Genre Savvy Ace Pilot Badass that becomes a Big Brother Mentor to Kira Yamato in the third.
Hey Gundam seed.
9Pet the Dog (In Alpha 3, after beating the EVA 01's copy, Gendo Ikari tells his son he actually wanted to comfort him, but never had courage to open up. Before he dies, he finally tells Shinji he's glad to see his son grow into such a strong man)
was up?
/me throws his stockpile of nuclear missiles at the chat, causing a chain reaction that destroys all life in the solar system
Can you have your mecha transform in this game?
Too bad that is all non-cannon
9Skye: a few, yes.
Kosoveon: you're too late, I nuked it already.
wow you type fast
cool
9Solarboy27: it IS SRW canon
damn you ;_:
So Shinji still faps to girls who are dieing
*;
9fun fact: the SRW games actually occur in a multiverse similar to Marvel's
wat am i watrching?
This is such an epic game.
Yeah, the SRW multiverse is kinda weird
9mib: SRW Z2
when are the pony's starting?
9fuck I hate these things
so what would happened if I played through SRWJ the entire way ONLY using my OG unit? would I just that badass?
lol mib, you are too late.
they already happened
9you're WAY late to the party bro

All they need to add to this series is a few autobots.
9ValtheJean: it's mostly impossible
There are autobots Mib_f4

9mib: they've tried doing stuff like that. It ended up with GaoGaiGar in Alpha 3
04o-o
Yeah

9in about 7-8 hours or so, mib
But I'd love to see Optimus kicking ass
About 14 hours anon

Ahh, SEED Destiny, that's why I didn't recognize him. I'm still trying to erase that abortion from my memory
god that's so awesome, lol
Actually, Celestia, Luna and one other would pilot Aquarion
it's a combiner
Celestia, Luna, Twilight

The pilots need to be in sync when in Aquarion

Man I hate the FFTA judge system
I keep forgetting what I can't do
Pinkie would pilot Big O
i actually liked it when it wasn't shitting on me
Even though I wasn't promised it, I demand Talgeese!
The judge system is the stupidest thing ever.

YEAAAAAAH
VERITECH GOOOOOOO

boob attack!
9yes, yes it is
sweet
Okay, I get it, you have boobs.
I love the class/race system in FFTA and everything but I could do without the judges.
THIS NEVER SEEMS TO HIT ATTAAAACK!
damn, bitch can't aim
well she does seem to telegraph the attack
Well, she is throwing a giant shuriken with her skinny robot arms
lol
at Real units, which are known for their agility
true, why the hell would she decide that's better than a gun
because he has troll dodge
Can we finish her with the Satillite Cannon?
9more like I know how to utilize Spirit Commands/Seishin effectively to not get hit frequently
She one of the villians?
9Purple: >implying that isn't the plan
pwnd

9"Microwaves...incoming!"
9"Twin Satellite Cannon...LAUNCHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"
LUNAR CANNON! SHOOOOOOOOOOT!
DAMN that was cool
25 dmg
yup, she's dead
lol
Luna needs to get that cannon so the new lunar republic can win
someone needs to tell these pilots that its shoot from the hip not shoot for the hip
lol
i aim for the head my self
9"Luna! Eina! Put the Sol Graviton Spiral Crusher Punch on Standby!"
bewm headshot?

Gravion's schtick is the power to manipulate gravity, yes/
what is this were watchin?
srw
Super Robot Wars Z2
i was promised ponies :(
For the New Lunar Super Robotic Republic!
you missed them
Imagine the marvel universe, but replace it with mecha shows
9we aired ponies earlier
9you're late brah
we're watching robots do freakin robot battles
bah stupid work hours
9we're watching Giant Robots
"actually... Wouldn't the hips be close to were the Engine of robots would be.
i can see that
9do Celestia's bidding and banish other robots to the moon
9no joke
there's always tomorrow
shoot lazers
i like ponys but i like robots to so im good
I would imagine the engines are on the back
Show him DCD
cockpits tend to be at either hip or chest level
9here
9BANISHMENT TO THE MOON PUNCH! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQgHIbF-U
I just sent a friend that doesn't like ponies this link cause he LOVES MECHA
youd think they would want to shoot for the chest in an attempt to take out the pilot
Megas in SRW would be FUCKING EPIC
I did so love Megas XLR
same megas kicks ass
They're showing Megas tommorrow
9DAMMIT BRO HOW COULD YOU GET HIT HE HAD 11% HIT CHANCE
he needs to have his ultimate be "teleport a soda bottle to your enemy's computer"
slurpee
9TRANS-AMU!
Tension in battle?! What a revolutionary concept!
TRANS AM!
Going RAINBOOM!
show the robot monster no mercy
I'm confused, why are they talking about Trans-ams now
no this more like road kill
is that who makes gundams in the future?
lol
Anybody here ever use ponies as a penalty game in bets?
The TRANSAM is that Gundam's 'super mode'
basically turns it into Rainbow Dash
No, I use them as rewards
no the bet was ponys
9Trans-AM
get your own damn box
9is basically a Sonic Rainboom
Trans-AM
A reality where the whiny teenage psycho bitch sucks up her issues and marches to combat. I approve
/me takes Chees-it's and runs
meto
*z
9there's even a picture of RD using Trans-AM
ouch that had to hurt
holy tits, actual damage
Reals can't really take hits
Damn, she's close to dying in this reality too.
That's more Super Robot territory
I had a bet were my friend had to watch ponies if lost a pokemon doubles battle
Reals are good at DODGING
Dat Cleavage
good by robo dino
Playing pokemon seems like torture enough
I love how it explodes, then implodes
so in a way, it's exploding twice
i watch the first five ep of romeo x Juliet juan watch first five of mlpfim to see which is better guess who won?
well I'm off to bed, catch everyone tomorrow during GIANT ROBOT NIGHT!
night crono
NIGHT CRONO SEE YOU LATER
Purple:that fic was awesome
well an pokebattle don`t last for 2+hours
APPLES
What fic?
you didnt read the RD exploding twice fic?
Sweet Apple Massacre?
Nope
9CELESTIA'S BEING
hmm... think i'll just check back in ten minutes, see if you are on the next level
I won that pokemon battle... because I sure as hell didn't want to watch 8 golf tounements
yeah golf sucks to watch
its pretty awesome, it makes fun of all the RD fics where she gets killed off
not to bad to play
HOLY FUCK
8 TOURNAMENTS?
You realize how long that is?
I had to uneven the scales of the punishments to get him to agree.
as long 5 moon banishments this game?
Huh? SRW?
That's not punishment that's fucking torture.
Honestly though, do you even realize how long ONE tournament is?
Well my friend doesn't like ponies
id rather be waterborded my self
but what it was pony golf XD
Is this a game or a show?

9a game
Did he watch the ponies?
A game

Did he liek the ponies?
NO

He's prob watching ponies right nao

That's like admitting summer is warm, it doesn't mean shit
Go Valkyries!

Let's post colors
9not really

13I concur
/me puts leash on Umbreon and avoids ownership.
He also begged for mercy when Pinkie pie started singing.
That is a very, very pink gundam
lol
rofl
http://miburl.com/JxQmlI you mean this?
9also just a heads-up: dari's script is still running
0I saw
The ponies beg for mercy when pinkie pie sings XD
I love these dodge animations. As if missing the attacks missing wasn't insult enough, the targets practically flip the bird off to the ones their opponents while doing it.
!umbreon
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 19 minutes
12nooooooooo
that just never gets old for me :)
/me floofs Umbreon
the first concept art by the way
12eep
0Should I take Arian Foster or Mike Vick as my first round draft pick tomorrow?
I'm sure that rainbow dash indeed sometimes yells at Pinkie to stop singing...
dude are at least half done 0_0
way*
[s]take rainbow dash as first draft[/s]
so op
0No wai, I'll take AppleJack first
12now what

RD: Pinkie I know how to play super robot wars! I don't need you to sing a musical number about basic smatagey

I need to sleep so I can finish other stuff I need to get done
Pinkie: OHhhhOHHHHHOooohhhhHHH Critical hit!
master spark?
Gravion: When your giant robot has 'Super-Heavy God' in the title, you know you're big
I don't know what's going on story wise but I'm sure it's epic.
whoa, that was pretty cool
:<
Basically: Dimensional collapses and all that
sorry...I can be quite insensitive sometimes :(
big multiversal time-space screwiness
PO battle, anyone/

9well

12yay
eenope
okay, this depresses me, brb while I get the reference
0He parachuted away before the thing exploded... right?
Gundam wing was my first thought but the quote isn't right
http://www.blastwave-comic.com/comics/20060501.jpg
there
lucky me i watch alot of anime or id have no clue whats going on
be educated
I only know "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR", sorry
0That whale is pissed
missed again
"Hitchikers Guide to the galaxy"
"Your macross missile massacre IS A PALE IMITATION"
hnnnng
9if you think that's impressive
okamiden soundtrack
cannot stop listening to
That's how you REALLY do it
I read that as apple imitation
9my Mazinkaiser in SRW J gets 10 damage from most attacks
12lol
9most bosses can only cause like 600 damage tops with their strongest attacks
especially two battle songs
0Everytime that green haired girl talks, the guy stops smiling
and Chibi's Crisis
That's pretty awsome.
12:)
9also Alto is totally Caramel
9and Alto-himesama is Caramelle
wait this is wrong
I am a soul eater character
wow mega pwnd
I must listen to SE OST
which one is Alto?
maybe
but I will not
9bro in the Valk
WELL DA~MN
*sniff*
oh shit son
suddenly, MONSTERS
Holy Shit.
12souls are too high in fat
DCD...words cannot describe...the bro love...I have for you right now
get over here man
While Pinkie pie would screw with SRW cannon and just pilot a hacked Autobot.
/me hugs DCD in a totally non-gay way
0group hug?
count me out
the fuck, Kog'Maw?
Did I see Renton Thurston in that group of pilots?
NO ONE CAN MESS WITH CARAMEL
So, barf is as good a weapon as a gun?
/me is 'bout to go sleepy nappy.
9look
lol
9it's Alto-Himesama http://washiblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/254770628.jpg?w=285
Looks like it Lgl
9or Caramelle
lol
9also that's not gay, it's just a running joke in the series
Now I'll get to see Gurren Lagann in action
IT'S HIS TWIN SISTER GOD DAMN IT
man I never finished that series
9I know
9but it was still so damn exploitable
That's another Gravion unit...
god damn man
I was totally about to love you
and you....you broke my heart
/me 9trollfaces
9just as plan
9in all seriousness Caramel would probably be Balzac from SRW J
9because of this legendary line
9"After this is all and over with, I'm going back to the farm!"
haven't gotten the balzac yet
....
one of these days dcd
That's more of a Big Mac line
I'm going to drive over to panama
9but it's cool how he mentions it
9it's like
and shove that shoe of yours so far up your ass
9OHAI I'M FUCKING YOUR SHIT WITH THIS FERMION CANNON
9WHILE MUSING ABOUT GOING BACK HOME
What are those creatures?
I'll believe it when I see it
9Balzac is actually kinda cool once he stops being a dick
until then, you remain my arch-enemy
9aside from the unfortunate name
9...goddamn it
9I made a pun with his name unintentionally
0I see no bad fortune in having the name Balzac. I would love to have that name
FUCK YOUR TENTACLES, MONSTER. I HAVE GUNS.
9but yeah Balzac is cool
is that solid snake?
/me starts a conversation
This is why you don't go after a CAPITAL SHIP
9suddenly JIBUN WO
12what you think about twilight?
One can dream it is, one can dream.
Here comes ZERO
lolNOPE
9Balzac is a cool name
GO NIRVASH!
9but you'd get endlessly teased about it sounding like another word for scrotum
0Balzac is best name
ALRIGHTY EVERYBRONY.
that...that's a robot on a hoverboard.
1:45AM in the morning.
Can't stand more.
Yes
it's not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be, but I hate seeing people freak out over it
GOING TA BED
And he's on the HEROES side
and
9>Chaotic Evil
lgl: yes. yes it is.
that's about it
gnight dermathil
12ahh
0GOOD NIGHT SWEET PRINCE
9more like CHAOTIC DON'TFUCKWITHMYLOVEDONES
12justin bieber?
lgl: See Eureka 7.
Well then, that's the best thing I've ever seen
cya Val
again, same
I just wouldn't listen to any of his songs because I don't like songs with actual lyrics
oh right I am still in here.
/me nods
dcd i agree
9also lgl: at 9:30PM EST tomorrow
the weird sounds in the background of some of the stuff I listen to doesn't count
9I'm starting Giant Robot Saturday Brony Night
like the epic EYOOOOOs in a lot of the Okami/den songs
9and one of the shows that will be aired on it is Eureka 7
9so you might want to come and see your mechs on hoverboards
12or the sounds of screams in the background like someone is getting killed
hell yeah
just dont discontinue it after a week like cartoon network did with theres =p
12then it turns out someone actually got killed while recording that?
yes like that
c:
giant robots on hoverboards xD
9two episodes per night
wait...that hoverboard
then again puting eva in a prime time slot was dumb move.
I'm not an anima guy, but fuck it that needs to be watched.
cool ill be there
is it from the same series as that show you were using during the "stress test"
BENDY BEAMS OF DEATH
Fuck my spelling. >_>
9yes, yes it is
aha
thought as much
9nice going, Renton
0We need to watch Bokurano
Nirvash says NO to the tentacle!
EdwardNewgate: NO
NO NO NO
NewDCD: for GRSBN, will Gundams be involved?
He's seen enough hinti to know where that is going.
9Cakeboss: Gundam X
9okay
9the listing
9a movie each night if possible
0YES YES YES. Though the manga is much better
FUCK. YES.
9this Saturday: Macross - Do You Remember Love?
9two eps of Gundam X
oh just to be friendly id like to say hi to everypony im a new brony
I was just about to beg for Gundam X
9two eps of Eureka 7
NO BOKURANO! I don't want to cut myself when the marathon's over
9two eps of Gravion
9two eps of Big O
9and finally two eps of Megas XLR
9that's our current format
0And one ep of Bokurano, right?
9DAMMIT RENTON
no
9maybe someday, but for now that's the roster
nnn
9think of it as a sort of channel
12lol
......did nervash just coo?
I kinda wanna sprite something
9when one show is over another will take it's slot and so on
prolly for the okamidex
but what
9yeah, the Moevash from the movie
04ohai
9most people hated the movie
9so let's not talk about it
*headdesk*
yes
0Honestly, you need to spring it on people too. Like don't tell them what it's about, just show it and watch their hopes and dreams get crushed
04Saw your stuff. Pretty neat.
what are we watching? @_@
thank you
c:
Super Robot Wars Z2
Geez, it seems to take forever to get to your turn
04Personally I prefer your chocolate dex to the Okami dex, but that's probably because I haven't played Okami myself.
9we're watching shit get fucked with explosions everywhere forever
/me = Lyon btw
lots of enemies
yes I know
Super... Robot... wars? wow.
hey
04You are seriously dedicated.
Disgaea Plays faster.
Bokurano is not a crowd series. That's one that you watch on your own so you can cut yourself in privacy as you're reminded of how shitty existence is
it's Michal bays new screen play.
how so
That's because the animations don't take as long
Sumica I could see that happening.
because I plan to make 1298+ sprites?
9SUDDENLY
Bokurano is the Anti-MLP
so is this game like Fire Emblem where if they die in the game they die forever?
only death is plot
9OH GOD
I saw Kira!!
9OH YES
9OH YES OH YES OH YES OH YES OH YES
because formes
derp eyes
9SUDDENLY
9THE REAL
0Honestly DCD.I'm recommending Bokurano be the first new series put in. Most likely after Megas ends
9GENUINE
DEM DERP
9TRUE
Strike or Strike Freedom?
no idea what I'm gonna do with the unown things
9YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
9OKAY BOYS
9TIME FOR YOU TO PUT YOUR SYNTH GENERATORS AT FULL POWER
9CAUSE WE'RE GOING 80'S, BABY!
04Spriting that many images takes alot of time and dedication. Thus, you are very dedicated to have done as much as you already have.
takijng it up to 11 again?
MY BODY'S NOT READY
but Big O... and Gurren...
04Kudos to you.
=C
9YAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTE
well it doesn't take as much time as it might seem
9YARUZE!!
03hah, finally someone admits it
04I know, but still - that many.
But if we get a chance to stream Disgaea, I'd love to see the Prinny Dance special move.
I made almost all of the okamidex so far in like two weeks
DA MAGICS!
04How much time do you put in to spriting each day?
it depends
04I don't sprite very often anymore, so yeah.
Ahh super robot anime, the only thing about 80s animation other than Don Bleuth that didn't suck.
Original Dancouger is on our side now
Send out BIG O!
What about Thundercats!
/me is still waiting for Talgeese :P
Especially Thundercats
I usually have to be a perfectionist and fix every tiny mistake I find just to realize that it looked better before I 'fixed' it
so that makes the sprites take more time than they should
SHOW TIME!!
I had a co worker we called big-O
but prolly like 20 minutes each
give or take
CAST IN THE NAME OF GOD!
04Ah
YE NOT GUILTY!
YE NOT GUILTY
well if I reshade or add markings that is
awww yeah
or fire for that matter
And the thing that looks like a rock was kaboomed!
what show is this?
robotic
*robotech
EAT SKY DRAGON CANNON
why am I being interviewed with formalities and such
it is making me nervous
mother fucking awesome
wooooooO!Wooooo! Wooooo! Sparklely!
not robotech
04lol
04Just wondering really
Nanoha should be in this, she is praticaly a gundam herself.
this is a gundam seed right?
04It usually takes me 40 minutes to make a sprite, but then I procrastinate alot
9no, this is Gundam X
9aka BEST GUNDAM SERIES
9don't confuse it with SHIT and SHIT Density
SECOND BEST
Nanoha isn't gundam-sized
TURN A
lol
*TURN A IS BEST
I usually cba to use an actual playlist and take a minute or two to choose which song I want to listen to once one ends so
I resent that. Seed is great.
Seed was last gundam I ever saw... sorry.
that adds to time as well
9well
9SEED was decent
Here comes ZERO
this pleases me
I should probably practice scratching more
9but it became the shittiest shit on SHIT Density
so I can like
work for a video game company thing later in life
9and Kira became and unlikeable Jesus Mary Sue
9Assram was just as bad
Pfft, everyone knows Zeta is the best. /UCElitism
because my parents keep bothering me about what I'm gonna do when I grow up and how I'll make money and whatnot
0I'm sensing some hostility
what is this game?
and actual effort that I don't enjoy in any way at all ewww
/me casually inserts Talgeese reference because he can
so yeah
Clearly, you're forgetting about G Gundam
It's Super Robot Wars Z
2
SEED Destiny is in the same space as the Star Wars Prequels, the Matrix Sequels, and season 2 of Darker Than Black. It didn't happen
looks pretty badass
this hand of mine.
*Brohoofs ValtheJean*
9well, X is best traditional Gundam
G Gundam was so corny it had funny narm charm.
is burning red
04Heh
9and Z is best UC
Turn A>X>Victory>G>Wing>Z>MSG>ZZ
9and so on
/me Brohoofs Kaempfer
04I could never do art/spriting for work.
04I'm extremely fickle about when I want to do it
Turn A looks pretty gay
the mobile suit I mean
9Riders: only that supposedly they fixed the shit out of SEED Destiny in the original SRW Z
these are the best scratches I've ever made
applejackismaiwaifu: YOU TAKE THAT BACK
and they're not even that good
http://www.iaza.com/work/110813C/iaza11842839622500.gif
derp
the only thing cool to come out of darker then black 2 was that gun.
THE MOONLIGHT BUTTERFLY WILL FUCK YOUR SHIT UP
Mezinger?
ok, moonlight butterfly sounds kinda gay
so out of curiosity DCD, will I actually get to see Talgeese at some point this stream, or will it only appear much later?
Though, honestly I've never seen Gundam X, so I'm looking forward to that
I'm partial to 0080 and 8th MS team myself
GAH
MAZINGER
KILL IT
@cakeboss eeyup
KILL IT WITH FIRE
But it will still send you back to the stone age
Ohhh, it's the NEW Mazinger
NEO MONSTER ISLAND!
it was pretty overpowered don't you think?
03wtf is iaza.com
9oh Nia
9y u so moe
it is an image thing
Yoko>Nia
like
03oh
Throw a galaxy at him!
photobucket and stuff
03OK
Late UC is best UC
I thought that'd be obvious
03I didn't actually click on it :P
03but I saw /work
03and was like what
ouch
0That thing has a sword coming out of its stomach
line 10 Drink Beer line 20 Rocket Punch line 30 Back to line 10
Agreed, CakeBoss
Kaempfer: F91 4 lyfe?
fff
it is 2 AM
03yep
I probably won't sleep tonight
maybe
03and I need to get up at 9
So I take it the VF 6 sucks newdcd
03fun, eh?
OUCH!
I've been trying to fix my sleep schedule
9using a shield like a sword
9like a baws
Actually, I've just started watching Gundam and haven't gotten that far yet :P
how do you do that random number meter thingy?
but I'm not very good at this
I used to be able to do it but it's been so long
I dont think you can till they bring back magnet.
awww
03off to bed
9so yeah
03or at least off IRC, I might work on building my desktop more
9not till monday
people spamed it like crazy during the first movie so they booted it.
Considering waiting until Unicorn finishes, but that'll be a while
Leverage, anyone?
Would it be awefull if they added Megazord to this game?
also I just realized
want
dirge forme Contra looks like she's flipping you off
Voltorn, just not car one.
Hehehe, not at all
original megazord only
Not really
she's supposed to be holding her hand out
That guy has a scar, obviously he must be a bad ass
Voltron was in one of the games
[s]has no idea[/s]
Optimus Prime /game
Well, I'm out my Bronies, gonna go eat
Unicorn won't finish for another year. why wait?
Really?!
lol I can picture it now
SUDDENLY: "GOKAI GALLEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOON!"
not so im coverd in scars and im not badass
Continuity, CakeBoss, continuity
9SCOOTA BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMU
badass in training
But is it a bigass face scar?
Really going now, ta bronies
That's the one that matters
true
anyone else glad Bandai is finally releasing mobile suit gundam on DVD
with JAPANESE AUDIO!!
F91 and Victory are completely detached from Unicorn
mine are on my legs and arms
Grimlok in this game would shoot lasers whenever he roared.
F91 and Victory make up the late UC, which feels like an AU
9KNOT BUSTER INCOMING
9TIME TO FUCK THAT FRACTAL KNOT
esp. compared to mid UC, which is still very closely tied to early UC
I shall try to sleep now
nut buster!
BAAAAAAAAA BABA BAAAAAAAAAAA BABA BAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BABA BARARARARARARAR
OW MY BALLS
DAI-GUARD!
/me sighs
I'm going to selfdestruct rather then live my robot life ball less
04I'm an idiot

04Kimi-Cynder, am I correct?
lol

04Obviously I can't SO DERP
/me headslams
Veritech are weak?
The Veritech: Pwner of Evil
What is that thing?
idk but fear his robo dreds
9King Gainer
BIG O
THE ONLY GUY I KNOW
<_<
monolog then ass kicking
heh
Big O looks really weird in SD
Don't remember him having a Gatling gun
thing...
King Gainer was made by Tomino
during one of his happy times
dont use it much in the show
DRILLLLL!
Yes
When did that happen?
he alwasy was!
9uh, since the start of that animoo?
OH GOD THATS NEWS TO ME
:P
hello
whaddup?
Holy crap, next you're going to tell me that Suzaku is a hypocritical boy scout bitch
howdy flutterhi
go scoots go
Uh... how many episides of Code Gease did you watch.
9wait didn't I have Suzaku as a selectable unit before this
9...I think he left us due to the Euphemia incident
the whole thing...
sarcasm is lost in text
spinzaku
oh....
lol
lol
sorry
is fine
:)
9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
ow right in the robo nads
behold my magical fisting ability
LOL!
ouchies
BOOM!
I was thinking that!
9also
9fuck yes
blew hies nads out the back of his head.
9check out that awesome kill
BIG O: PROVING THAT THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KICK ASS, IS A GIGANTIC ROBOT FIST.
GIANT ROBOT BATMAN WILL FUCK YOU UP
9DOSE SNAPSHOTS
DEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHH
Now to slice that thing in half.
MANLY OLDSCHOOL ROBOT ACTION
mecha really changed after Eva
dem surfin robots
9a Decon Recon Switch of the Super Robot genre
so how is he lifting with no trapar?
Sheer Hotblood
no eva in this one?
He says NO to Gravity
9not in this one. Eva was in MX and the Alpha series
Is it wrong that I just want to see some Satellite Cannon?
9OKAY BABES TIME FOR PONY PENETRATION
oh god, the eva timed attack from mx
9Cakeboss: it ain't, but in this game you have to wait five turns between Sat. Cannon usage, unlike in Alpha where I spammed the shit out of that
dont stop till you reach the back of it's teath newdcd!
insert Xena theme here
12night whoever might go to sleep
9I FUCKING LOVE THIS DYNAMIC KILL
I WILL RAPE YOU WITH LIGHT!!
9jUST SIT IN THE COCKPIT
9NOT GIVING A FUCK
So chill
so yeah NINEBALL?
EH, IN A BIG FUCKING ROBOT THAT CAN KILL ANYTHING. NOT A BIG DEAL
was that chain sword?
KINGU! KINGU! KINGU GAINAAAAAAAA
Yes
epic
9AMAZING!
9AMAZING ENERGY!
A giant robot with dreads and a chainsaw sword
9PHOTON....BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!
9TAKE THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!
Mikuru BEEEEEEAAAAAMMMM
lol simple twist of a dial and PEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
9"MAZINGER...FULL POWER, GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"
some one needs to use sword chucks too.
9"HOW'S THAT? IT'S THE POWER OF PHOTONIC ENERGY!"
its over 9000
huh
Bitch, get yo ass into space
I have a new respect for Mazinger
I guess it helps that in this game he has something more than a fucking Boob cannon
9I love how Alto is only being stopped by the fact he's running out of ammo
yey macrooooos
so what's with all the nut shots in this game?
now if only we could get megas in one of theese.
GO VERITECH GO
9well
9cockpits are usually at chest level in mechs
9unless you're Jehuty, in which you are in the crotch
9the head is basically an overglorified optical/signal sensor
Or Dolores
or Turn A - crotch
Turn A's more of a Belt Buckle
would so love to see coops head slam the big red button attack.
but wouldn't it make sense to put the most important person in the harder to hit area?
or Psycho Gundam - Head
most armore
I never did understand Kojima's knowledge of mecha anatomy
I mean...the chest isn't exactly the hardest part of the machine to hit
*armored
9so for a quick kill
9you should aim for the body
and isn't the Sazabi's cockpit in the head as well?
although I like this captain
9well consider the fact that
he aint got NOTHING on the Russian captain from the first season
9it's bigger hit area but also allows for better armoring
kinda reminds me of Kalinin from Full Metal Panic
I guess
oh damn I forgot about fmp mechs.
Get me the Arbalest!
9also the cockpit might be there
9but it's a relatively small area, relatively speaking
9I have Arbalest in SRW J
9it pwns
9I also have Bonta-kun and his attacks are hilarous
GET ME THE GOD DAMN TALGEESE
Loved how the arblast became a bit of a smart ass in TSR
ok here one why do thay call it a cockpit?
Cuz only dudes were supposed to be there
because of the nature of pilots?
otherwise they'd call it the box car
02Hey Lyon
lol
EXPOSITION
02Morning
12how goes
...no
9give me a moment
9got to consult akurasu wiki

Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy

9let's go with mobility
02Playing with Manly
9and make him unhittable
12lol
out of curiosity, is mobility just the mech's version of the evade stat on pilots?
04What are you playing?
04@Shiny
02Terraria
04Ah

dust, cats, fresh cut grass, pollen
and um
some other stuff
I think
also I stay home alone all the time

I'm allergic to cats, too
do they make you unable to breathe
I shall sprite

then it's not anywhere near as bad

04Or have you done that already?

not for the Okamidex
which thing
Back
ah
04so NOT for the Okamidex?
Hi Anon
.
04You're confusing me
no I haven't made it for the okamidex
I already made it for the DCDex though
04And it might have something to do with this new background making text hard to read
I know all about that
because I am a derp
04Do Grovyle for the Okamidex if you haven't done it then.
and have a multicolored background
but what for grovyle
04I have a dark purple one.
there are sixteen things I can do with it
/me dorks
oh
so brush god then
/me doesn't know all the terminology sorry
I have all the types listed under the spoiler for it
and they're linked to the first ones I made of those types

I did, too
How are you?
Fine,and you?
Oh, Drake
Good
04?
Hey Pegacorn
Ohai Dermathil
I'm writing up a My Little Pony crossover. I'll post the chapters if you want them.
Yall seen the explaination about Spiderses on EqD?
7Well, I just found out that Europe resembles Kyurem.
It is the pony equivalent of Half Life: Full Life Consequence
I should warn you, it's a power rangers crossover
Dermathil,what are you talking about?
o.o
we're making this confusing
HL:FLC?Awesome!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/spiderses-dramatic-live-reading.html#more
Spiderses is an horrible fanfiction.
Probably the one that was worst written
(orthographically)
It is HL:FLC levels of bad writing.
And there is already a dramatic reading of it
.____________________.
Derm, do you mean even worse written than Cupcakes?
Okay.
By a lightyear.
04gnight everyone
):
ah
:(
Barry,never mention that fic again.
wow, that was fast
Fail at writing Twilight's name in the first paragraph, example;
Drake's quit message is more interesting than kyurem
D=
lol
Kyurem?
Resembles Europe?
what's that?
o.o?
There must be
A PATTERN
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
no, Europe resembles Kyuremm.
-m
Kyurem obviously came first

HL:FLC!YAY!
grammar mistakes galore
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs
HL:FLC.

"if we're gonna be spiders forever, let's have Spidersex!"

Hey Silverscreen.

Or even listened to the live reading?
its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys.
12I like Kyurem owo
It is Half-Life: Full-Life Consequences levels of awesome.
"if we're gonna be spiders forever, let's have Spidersex!"
faster like the speed of sound
WEPON

JOHN FREEMAN GET OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
Not to change the topic, but I found a Pony Music video set to Fastest Thing Alive
Pegacorn, listen to the live reading of Spiderses.
And think of HL:FLC
JOHN FREEMAN YELLED AT THE TOP OF LUNGS
John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.
lol
AND FOUND WEPON
lolwut
CRUNCHY POTATER CHIPS
yeah

we need NewDCD to make a dramatic reading of his own.

Hi DMan

Nice
Hey Pegacorn

PR

WW is still in the works
^_^
But don't worry, I'll get back to it, sometime
KA-BEWM
Sure
DMAN
No, Pegacorn, no demoman >_<
how are ya
BRO!
i know
Did ya listen to the dramatic reading of Spiderses?
Good, good. Came back from my run not too long ago, t'was nice :3
It is HL:FLC levels of awesome.
aaaand i don't think so
what is Spiderses aniways?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
it is more than a fanfic. It is an EXPERIENCE
It's stupid.
Did you get the PM?
Just got back - people mid siesta - i'll plug it into our hugeass soundsystem in an hour or 2
Yh barry
Pegacorn, it is as stupid as Full-Life Consequences.
Dermathil,somewhat stupider than FLC.
Because FLC is Half-Life.So it gets away with being stupid.
I'm afraid of reading Spiderses just because of how hyped it is
Getring close to my destination
I mean, that's a lot to live up to.
Gtg, bye! =D
Last time i got hyped for something,it was Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen.And we all know how much it sucks!
Yea Demrathil what is spiderses about?
:P
Wait,i got hyped for something else after that.It was Kick-Ass.And that was awesome.
black screen is best pony
Rarity is best pony
12Angel ~
FreezeFrame,umad?
13LattÃ©~
If I had art skills, I'd draw her on my purple & white Chucks
goodnight
goodnight
Nah, all of the mane six are awesome
Rarity is just the best of the best.
oh god
I just found out "pronounciation" isn't a word.
/me mind = blown
In my opinion,Rarity is the worst of the six.
7ProNUNciation. :3
13Lol it's pronunciation
13xD
THIS IS NEWS TO ME D:
and goodnight
06:3
but STILL THIS IS NEWS TO ME
13It's ok, I always used to think that dependent was spelled as 'dependant" up until recently |D
lol
It always bothers me when people confuse -ant and -ent endings
like spelling existent as "existant"
Dman, spiderses can't be explained in words.
13Independent and Dependent are the only two words I got mixed up with xD
It is too special for that to be possible.
I can explain Spiderses in a word.
Dermathil - Bene. I will enjoy this
And that word is.....stupid.
SHHHHH
Right behing you.
I never had many problems with spelling things
but pronunciation I'd have just never guessed XD
/me is right behind Dermathil with the Spy's knife.
*behind
because you don't pronunce things, you pronounce them
wtf english language :(
/me backstabs Dermathil
/me throws his jarate behind him.
/me dodges the backstab.
AAAAAAAH!PISS IN MY FACE!
/me then stabs Pegacorn with his tribalsman shiv. Twise
*Twice.
OW!
(aka DOT MINICRITS)
for some reason the stream kicked me out a million times yesterday
i was on the road
ohai interior_gummy
ohai doggy
Interior_gummy
/me is bleeding
/me 11grins as both Pegacorn and Dermathil turn a corner to find his sentry there ready to blast both to smithereens.
that's because Dari setup a chatcap
maximum 200 people in chat
11Either Dari or the server itself.
GODDAMN SENTRY!
11We aren't sure.
Doubting it is the server.
We could reach 250 before
we need to watch the room again
THAT FREAKIN' SENTRY'S A SPY!
/me turns back the corner as Pegacorn attracts all the fire.
the english language is really wicked
11Sentry's sappin' mah dispenser!
/me scopes and charges his shot.
/me peeks around corner and snipes turret. Twice.
(kaboom)
Bewm.
/me 11grabs revenge shotgun. LEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEENKIIIIINS!
Dermathil, have you seen 'meet the pegacorn'?
NONONO
I heard you two try it
/me snipes Silverscreen at Closerange.
(I do it for breakfast.)
/me 11flops over.
/me 11uses god modding to throw his corpse at Dermathil :P
Silverscreen,they're gonna have to glue you back together.....IN HELL!
Dermathil - want to see meet the pegacorn? If pegacorn doesn't mide
mind *
I DON'T WANT TO.
Ok, Pegacorn, I respect your request.
brb
Gotcha
http://pastebin.com/6yTykQtR
Dman, I listened to yall guys practicing in here.
lul
Because you know that the latter gave me 'Nam flashbacks.
Dermathil - poracticing?
I wrote it all >_< and then posted it here
also, dermathil, you up for skype in a while?
yeah no prob
ØŸ
is an awesome punctuation mark
Dman,Rule number 1 with me:NEVER show anypony "Meet the Pegascout".EVER.
:3
Pegacorn - Got it
interior_gummy
I get an ad to visit Israel.
I doubt it is religion-related.
Barry - sent request for part 2 of fanfic

ah
(just incase you wanted to know. I don't mind which you use, should you use one, but i'm sure it's more fun to type '@derpymail.org' than '@gmail.com' :P)

BOOM
ERRYDAY I'M SHUFFLIN'
oh, how I wish my state wasn't so stingy with financial aid.

/me still charges in
HAAAAAAAAAA
and then the pants were dead
/me stops, sword drawn above his head...

Huh?
Pegacorn, what are they doing?
They're shufflin'.
But you're there with them
What's going on
I somehow started to shuffle,then they came out of nowhere and started shufflin'.
/me lowers his sword besides him, his face showing signs of discombobulation
*sigh*, ok then, shuffle all ya want then, but don't scare me like that unless it's an emergency!
Ohgod.They're moving towards me!
/me speaks lazily, without raising his head, due to disbelief.
Oh really now?
And do they wanna eat you? dance with ya? what is it this time?
OHGOD!
/me sees a Jockey jumping towards him,followed by a Hunter pouncing towards him
/me looks up, through his hair
Pega, they friendlies?
I dunno-OHGOD!
/me is jumped on by both the Jockey and the Hunter
(brb)
(aww man)
(i await your return)
(i'm back)
(bene)
Pegacorn, ya need help?
Ohai Topaz
I DO NEED HELP!
/me suddenly disappears from the chair, and appears besides pegacorn, crouched over, his katana pointed outwards, perfectly horizontal with the floor. He looks up at pegacorn.
/me once again disappears. no, no he doesn't, he moves quickly. He moves to pega's other side, and his sword is now level with the floor yet pointing the other way. A dead jockey and hunter fall to the floor.
Arm yourself, pegacorn
Ok.
/me picks up a shotgun
You got any guns? I don't

Hello everypony
hi, mazoot
howdy mazoot
Luna's reaction to G3.5 Rainbow Dash is awesome.

That story wouldn't happen to be named for someone else's excellent adventure, would it?
after, not for
Barry: Yes, it's named for that. It's the MLP/MLP/MLP/MLP/Transformers crossover

I THINK I FOUND THE FULL GAME DOWNLOAD
ANGEL

I was watching two of those
Pokemon and DBZ
And Digimon

13Oh come on

/me shuns her computer
IT'LL BE WRTH IT
13YES
13<3
13I was looking everywhere for it earlier but gave up
13I knew you wouldn't disappoint me :D
063 hours for ~400mb? Oh wait I'll be silent
And the Sea Ponies get referenced.
of course not
;p
now
I'm not too impressed with some of the characters
but the others are quite nice
and then there's Toyosa <3
Okay
ZUN is losing ideas for the abilities of characters
yeah he is
13!espeon
hey that's me

hey, did anybody else have issues connecting to epic-chat last night?
/me cling-eon
O i see now crono pony in your gallery
but yeah you should have seen aero and me try to pronounce toyosa's full name when we saw it
we failed miserably
the cmark wasn't looking perfect in the pic
hence my nickname toyosa, or as i called her DJ Toyo
because obvious reasons
i got "connection reset" the entire run of movie night >_<
I want to see a cutie mark that's an integral operand
GGgala
that's because the movie night now has a max of 200 viewers in chat
either dari or the server set that up
does that affect the server?
probably
i didn't even get to the point of /join #BronyState
ah
guys

I think the server itself has a capacity cap
:3
I just read Luna's Excellent Adventure, and some parts were funny, others, disturbing
lawl Barry, which was which?
Shoo be doo
"I'm going to walk outside, and if there's not a magical flying pony princess, there will be hell to pay. Of course, if there is a magical flying pony princess, there will still be hell to pay." I liked that line
Guys, this is Dermathil: http://i.imgur.com/ltSZr.png

Was it by coincidence Scott Pilgrim came out one year ago today that we're watching it this week?
Hooking up to TV for stream
Dave_BroZilla, maybe its the reason the person chose it?
k then
who's streaming? sprinkles?
True, but who did pick it?
DCD streamed last night
Anyways, tis food for thought
And speaking of food, I just woke up and need breakfast. or Lunch. Or Brunch. Or whatever the hell one eats at 1:14 PM
So, bye y'all, might pop in later for a rewatching of Scotty Pilgrim vs. Toronto
later dave

Hello, BMN-goers. I was previously NewManiac but I decided to go by the name I post as on Ponychan.
ah, welcome to BMN, Starbuck.
Need some coffee?
:3
Never heard that one before!
Or would you rather shoot a bunch of Cylons?
sweet, robot night
>_>
giant robots are the second best hasbro product
Never heard that one, either!
Lol
no transformers ATM
[/sarcasm]
If we get to eventually watch transformers, they'll be the good shows.
Like Beast Wars, I think.
So
I was going to live stream fanfic reading until I realized it was 30 minutes 'til the movie.
We will be beginning the Stream with Macross: Do you remember love, IIRC
I understand we're having a Giant Robot night?
hey Hipster_Brony
ohai hipster
Which ones are we watyching? Gurren Lagann? Gundam? Evangelion?
lemme see if I can remember
8morning everypony
Hello, Hipster.
we're watching two eps of Megas XLR
8 /afternoon
the Macross: Do you remember love
and...other things I can't remember >.<
I think there's gonna be some Gundam
Next Week though we have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Gurren Hen
as the robot movie
(the first movie)
NICE
I love TTGL :)
there are plenty of TTGL fans here.
me included.
9:30 EST is 8:30 central, right?
yeah, I think
My other name Pinkamina was really a Gurren Lagann reference but after the last "LOL PINKIE IS A MURDERER" joke got thrown at me I decided to change it
What are we watching this week, besides Scott Pilgrim and robots?
Monday is KAMEN RIDE
KAMENRIDER*
...
you get the idea
12How much time?
28 mins.
Hi, Pokey

8should be sirsprinkles, as usual
What are we watching this week, other than robots and Scott Pilgrim?
ung...what was it called...something Earth...this Land Earth?
This Island Earth?! Like in the MST3K movie?
creepy oompa loompa scientist movie from the fifties
You forgot their giant foreheads.
I'm here.
back
ohai silverscreen
Hi, Silverscreen!
alrighty thanks Hipster
Whoever is streaming should pull up the stream, then put the stream on the video capture.
brb, showertime
I just got an amazing idea! What if we mixed the Hub with Scott Pilgrim? Dan Vs. the World!
It would be amazing!
...the quality thing is new... Oo
0ouo
Oh hait, SirSprinkles.
so would anyone care if i didn't watch scott pilgrim b/c iv'e seen it so many times now.
hai*
Hi Sirsprinkles
Konichiwa SirSprinkles
We would not care, KAM1.
I agree Starbuck
Ray, you tuning in :3
Seconded
or is it Thirded?
howdy sprinkles
i think its third
Wait, Crono, what are we agreeing on?
That we wouldn't care
if KAM1 left before Scott Pilgrim
Show in 20 mins?
yep
maybe
Oh. I thought we were agreeing on my awesome crossover idea.
^_^
I guess
What crossover idea?
Dan Vs. the World.
That hasn't been done officially, yet?
I mean, The Hub hasn't done just that?
yeah, DCD put it in 2 or 3 days ago
There's been art of Dan vs. Equestria, but that's it.
It's just Dan riding NMM
I hope you mean on her back
You expect there to be an official Scott Pilgrim/Dan Vs. crossover?
Someone needs to make a Dan pony.
Mew
Cannot wait to hear Rex Reason's sexy ass voice
Well, know, but since the show is called Dan Vs., I thought The Hub would have already done something like Dan Vs. The World
no*
Yeah.
Oky.
Yes, Barry
Okay*
Hi, Silverscreen
hi silverscreen
he applied to be a mod
Hello, again, Silverscreen
i think we should fast track him tbh
I'll have a look at it when I get the chance.
konichiwa Silverscreen
Hi, Silverscreen
inb4 stream begins
i'm just watching rubberfruit while we wait
hi
11Colored hi
I've been listening to Meatloaf recently. Bat Out of Hell is an awesome album.
Meatloaf, recently.*
inb4 Rex Reason's voice makes my day complete
well, his app is super short (at my urging)
but i know him really well, and he would be a really good mod
As long as it's quality, I don't care how long or short the app is, tbh.

RainBroDash - last I read (was afk just now) Dermathil was the weeping angel, he still here?
OSHI
OH GOD HE IS
When I watched Blink, whenever the Weeping Angels were on screen, I tried not to blink to see f I would survive if I was in the character's places.
Anyone else do that?
I think so
0How much longer?
0e.e
Never seen the episode before, but if I do see it, I probably would now. >_<
4 minutes.
What we watching

Starbuck - you betcha
blarg...it looks like I've got to take my sister shopping today >.<. I'll be back in a few hours gents
I would like to add, didn't blink once when the Angels were on screen. U mad, Weeping Angels?
Bye, Val.
http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100429214152/tardis/images/3/3c/Weeping_angels_by_BugsyXoX.gif
Must. Not. Blink
10Starbuck, me neither. But when that light started flickering...
10Oh lawdy.
well, RainBro, the Angels were cheating in that scene.
Heya folks. From what I'd seen at EqD, this thing starts in about 5 mins, right?

5 minutes until showtime!
10You're damn right NightFurson
Answers my question! lol
My only problem with Flesh and Stone is that they suddenly forgot about the 4th wall rule for the Angels (from Blink)
10Assuming all goes to plan :P
10yo sathi :3
ya my eyes got very dry by the end of that episode.
Heyo Sathi

Starbuck I have
yeah starbuck

pony episodes?
Lemon Demon? **** me in!
eeeyup
Now, have you heard any of their stuff past Ultimate Showdown?
while I wait im going to draw
Yeah, some of it.
no
Like their Zelda theme mix that keeps getting attributed to SOAD?
Only ever heard of censored Count
tip: when on newgrounds, do not watch ultimate orgy
Mine was Boast Busters and I can't remember the other one, interior_gummy
Yeah i have a bunch of it
Is it just me or is there no broadcast
It's late
Because Saturdays are lax
CMC was the second episode
crono_flash, SEEN IT!
that was a pretty good parody.
Crono you choose pony episode?
Dunno how anyone thought that was SOAD though
Wait, I meant to say interior_gummy, not crono.
Starbuck,i think everyone has seen
I know, the singing was actually decipherable. :P
why is it not working, please help
Vegas: It's late
I like "I've got some falling to do"
Oh ok just making sure
Saturday BMN always starts late.
6No it doesn't.
10:P
my favorite of Lemon Demon's songs is Eighth Wonder.
6It usually starts right on time.
I know, I'm exaggerating for comedic effect
More of a Brony Movie Afternoon for me
I meant the episode and the newgrounds flash
6I'm just having issues with the setup. =/
Sorry to hear that :O
what happens when you put 50 bronys in a room and no video.... mostly this
6*shrug* It's just my comp eating itself
Its ok take all the time on the world if you need, I shall be watching marble hornets while I wait
indiana jones took him out with his whip

Graypaw, a fellow MH fan?! *fan squeal*
I own MH season on DVD. Watched it with my dad.
I'll just watch bunnies while I wait
MH season 1*
take all the time in the world Sir, im going to buy, build, and sell a ship in a bottle while i wait.

MH = ?
Marble hornets
Or maybe the Winter Wrap Up
song
Graypaw, do you watch everymanHYBRID? And yes, it's on DVD. It has director's commentary and bloopers.
ah, only MH I know of is Monster Hunter :S
Jir, MH stands for Marble Hornets. It's a YouTube seies.
I's playing gameboy, and listening to Fluttershy's Lament on loop
for hours X_x
MH is part of that whole Slender Man thing, right?
Yep.
6Just waiting for my audio program to work guys... =/
Why is the stream not working
k
oh we gonna get started soon?
I find it hard to take Slender Man seriously, because for some reason I associate him with the "haunting Torgo theme" from Manos: The Hands of Fate
No but I will now 0:-D
I'm play BlazBlue as Valkenhayn R. Hellsing will I wait, getting practice in when I finally vs NewDCD

To see if Nintendo likes to make power-saving consoles
Like the Wii :P
hmmm so it's not final\/

I wish I had his voice
12lol caring about how much power somthing uses
Uses barely any power compared to the other Current Gens xD
I'm THAT bored today
The only voice more manly than his is Flutterguy's.
Inorite. It's that sort of great radio voice that could make anything sound interesting.
My voice is, well, lispy
he goes to work in a jet
Yeah, he could read from the phone book and make it sound epic
until pilgrim, i go
Meh. Deathstalkcould take him and win any day of the week.
That means hes successful.
To be honest I want to see the sequal to attack of the killer tomateos

@mib_rwov4i, I won't make any agreements or disagreements until I get more information
WHAT ABOUT PLAN B
at least he don't have a klingon forehead
Okay Barry
I do say, old chap.
Plan A: getting a smaller forehead
these tweeds are rather smashing
needs more hats
FANCY SHINY PRETTY!
Plan A? that's the plan that's more likely to fail, go to plan B instead it works 80% of the time
Why IS his head so BIG?
More tea, Mr. Bike?
Brak is an onomatopoeia for when someone gets their forehead smashed into a wall.
0plan a is to sit around like a sir.
If that fails, go to Plan C... RUN!!
pretty pretty shiny shiny
"Karb"?
This guy's like an older Jimmy Neutron
Plan C is almost always run
That maid is so out of her league.
Plan 9. Explode sunlight

What's Plan Z?
WHat about Plan I form Outer-Space?

0it's an oompa loompa with a growth spurt.
SUNLIGHT = TINY ATOMS

Plan AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
No, plan 9 is raise an army of atomic zombies
Problem is I don't have a car.
Or something like that
WU TANG
movie's called "This Island Earth"
Plan Z is steal the king's or queen's crown and blame it on the burger joint manager, getting him imprisoned or executed in order to get his secret recipe.
0@alchemy_gold, No, plan 9 was to stop us blowing up the sun.
...
intersting title, since most of the earths surface is covered in water

Looks like he took my advice and went with plan B
So, for such a positive cat, all he's done is hiss at things and eat. So he's more like a normal cat.
Normal cats on Metaluna

Oh hi I am only here to die

AND THEN THEY F********ED

inb4 aliens
Dang. That laser was so effective, it made them explode into atoms rather than, ya know, what it did in the lab before. o.O
I'm guessing
0and then they filled a bucket.

There's no popups ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOON
9Macross/Robotech movie to start, then two episodes of Gundam X, then two episodes of Eureka 7, then two episodes of Gravion, then two episodes of Big O, and finally two episodes of Megas XLR
Our shabby outfits are specially designed for our planet.
Looks like tonight it's Macross: Do you REmember, Love?
mfw I never saw any of this
KNEW IT
oh, and an episode of Bokurano, right?
>Magnetized rails attach to flesh
FOALZ
I would agree to all their demands if they agreed to turn me into a pony
D:
this oughta be good

Symbionic Titan is forever forgotten

lol jenndy tatravosky who made titan also made samurai jack
Cheesy horror music, awesome.
Guys, don't know if Bjornfot has told you or not but he wishes to promote his FiM Dating Sim that he just finished
9I'm reluctant aboot streaming it, what with the AWFUL cancellation and all
time to get high
0why are the computers operated by a simn says wheel?
9that was just dissapointing as fuck
Just made it ;)
THESE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE CRAZY
what a tweest!
What did he say? Feel like a X?
Play the giant robot episode of Samurai Jack
...ew.
New toothbrush, I think
A blue Prankster Comet! Bring it on shadow Mario
Genndy also made Dexter's Lab
Brushie Brushie
i like the one where he fights in space
better than a giant robot operated by a steering wheel
He's awesome in general.
or 5
and gian robot episode of Dexter's Lab- beat me to it
I can see through her shirt
THEY'RE TREES
He wants to promote it and ask if people would want to play as males in the game. If he gets a good enough response, he says he'll program them in
<Bjornfot>: As you may know, I'm the programmer for the FiM Dating Sim. We now have a (temporary) website, and want everypony who would be interested in male characters (only female characters are planned as for now) to answer a quick survey. <Bjornfot>: dunno if it's really needed, not many on here today <Bjornfot>: it's just that i just finished it
fluttershy must be jealous
th one where he and mandark fight over the girl?
MC awaiting insturctions, up in htis bitch
*facehoof*
Tell him to go to ponychan with it.
yep Huffy
knew it agin! ha
>1000 years
9>Better than a Giant Robot operated on a Steering Wheel
Luna slept for 1000 years?
>Your curiosity as a woman
9Elky you clearly don't know the awesomeness that is Xabungle
I personally don't want that here. -_-; It's not something relevant to us in any way, nor will it benefit us to ask about it.
what wrong w/ megas xlr?
absolutely nothing
9also I love Megas
right
Eyes....they keep staring
/me 10is looking forward to it, because it sounds funny
10and.. bjornfot ftw
"What don't you understand, Doctor?" ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
EPIC
a quick google search leads me to the conclusion of 'not sure if want'
than whats better? oh yeah roger smith yelling into his watch
10but if you're not wanting to promote it, that's cool with me
10;P
Planets... that were comets?
Prepare phasers. Fire!
TINIEST PLANET EVER
Screw lazers! Hit them with comets!!
bjornfot isn't exactly on my good side at the moment in the first place
mfw Aliens saw this video and thought, HOW DO THEY KNOW?
I don't see the problem with it really. He hasn't explicitly said if it's NSFW, so...
My God, it's full of stars
comets 63.7% more powerful
drive me closer, I want to hit the with my comets!
Its Venom
He hasn't explicitly said it's not.
lol twilight tank ref?
wait... flute!
Oh my god, it's a GIANT FOREHEAD.
Getting stuttering, am I alone in this?
0sburb has been set in motion
Stream, why u no work?
Either way, if I send him to Ponychan it'll more than likely get eat up by purists
lol planet jackers?
I'd REALLY have to look at it before giving it the okay, myself...
Nope, RobotPinkie
Well
In that case
NOR-MAL VIEW!
USE SOLAR ENERGY
implying earth holds large quantities of Uranium :trollface:
gewd timing
LOL can fly a spaceship to Earth, can't create nuclear energy
....they need uranium to fuel an ion shield to protect themselves from comets.
coffee!
6This movie has the BEST special effects.
10we don't have to support it :P
Earth has lots of Uranium? BULLSHIT
i agree lol
can't be better than the ones of the 90s Dracula movie
Entering the kiddie pool, watch for yellow clouds.
That's why I'm gonna tell Bjornfot to try to put it up on Ponychan and see what people say
Also, New Hope had better special effects
Just tell him to put it on Ponychan.
which, by the way, is something we should definitely watch
^What?
10granted, bjonfot has a good few friends here, so outside of stream time around the time it's released, we'll be talking about it in bronystate anyway
Remember in this movie lead = Uranium so they have lots of it in this backwards universe
10it's on EqD if that helps
If it gets eaten up, then I'll look into it.
Movies from the 50's have poor special effects?
Behold the worst planet ever.
i'm gonna say Nothing to Lose if i win this week
Star Wars: Episode 4 HeavyMetalPony
what happen to silver screen? need cool facts about movie!!!!!
Around the time it's released, RainBro.
Man, this planet sucks
huffy: the lottery was yesterday
Man, your planet is shit.
I don't want to deal with it all the way up until that time.
right i'm friendzzz w/ him on facebook?
I know, but it sounded like you said it had bad special effects mib_rwov4i
crap
But if they have lots of lead and can turn it into uranium, couldn't they just use a transmutation circle to get it done faster instead of triangular laz0r screens?
0meanwhile in amsterdam
>Equestria is best planet
Well in this universe, science is horribly abused and left crying in the gutter.
This planet needs to be condemned
10:3
Which is what happens when you allow yourself to be associated with something like that.
10idd
I don't want to live on a planet that looks bad and is constantly exploding every 10 seconds
we need to protect our shitty planet

@PeanutButterWolf I agree Spike
This planet needs to be about 20% cooler

What color will THEY turn if you choke THEM?

He does?
Exploding planet cant stop exploding

the pokemon poet
Makes you think what is the point in all that :S
abandon thread!
This movie's desolate planet reminds me of WALL-E
Wait, sim, is that in Second Life or some other similar game
Troll attack incoming
Obviously, the point was: Padding Padding Pa-dding~ Padding Padding Pa-dding~
brohoof to mib_rwov4i
Oh god WALL-E I loved that movie so much
0it just me or do the meteors sound like tom?
This movie needed more than 2 explosion sounds
/me np: Donna Summer - The Power of One [03:49m/256kbps/44kHz]
brohoof received HeavyMetalPony
this seems fitting
They are loosing a battle from a alien race that throws rocks at them at close range.....yes I know that they are comets
remote controlled comets are the best weapons
Y U NO BLAST METEORS OUT OF SKY
yes cept it isn't covered in BUYN LARGES AND THERE AREN'T ANY CUBES OF TRASH ANYWHERE
Dumbass aliens
WALL-E is the best pixar movie
Bjornfot! Is that a "Sim" in Second Life, and is it related to MLP?
Their enemy uses hang-gliders as spacecraft, clearly they are a superior race to humans
best pixar movie=incredibles
0YOU FAIL AT SCIENCE FOREVER
BITCH
Luna is Sun?
Well, obviously the forehead aliens destroyed all the skyscrapers of cubes
FROM PLANET TO COMET IN 10 SECONDS FLAT

The ones I was aware of died to drama
i saw the second life video where a raptor is put against a pony cute s hell but after ten minutes, neither get hurt
His entire race was just destroyed and he's not even slightly broken up?
lol
nope
Say it with me now: Our planet, now rubble
Wow, a series of tubes.
logic over emotion
Bah, I hated everyone I've ever known anyway
So a sun is made by throwing comets at planets and not from compressed gasses........sounds plausible
seriously, fuc those magnets

Did he died?
0nothing, there was absolutely no point at all
Crappeople are mean? End of story?
"GOOD, they're out of the room, I can let out this massive fart"

IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT
So the heroes didn't actually do anything significant or save anyone
*Crab, lol

Why didn't the forehead aliens extract uranium from earth?

the moral is, all these people suck. except for fly-headed Mutants. They're awesome.
I've only made like two besides this one
And then they bang
Dumb aliens are dumb.
dat forehead?
OR IS IT
MAH SHIP IS BURNING
you failed!
Earth still being here after a few day = Miracle of God

Darf14: forcing Scott to drink penis-flavored tea?
This is how real life works people.

HeavyMetalPony: >implying penis doesn't taste great

Maxaminus1 If only real life worked like this
TROLOLOLOLOLOOOL
I didn't even notice she's pretty thin
It took Scott ten secodns to come up with the best reaction ever
her face deceived me
20% better than tea
I wish people would burst into coins after you defeated them
battlescars = STD'S?
they dont?
no poverty
CANADA 20% cooler
Drink it Scott drink this tea until you choke! MUHAHAHAHAH!!!!
brb, gotta close up at work
I wish I could get 1-ups in real life
It would make the death penalty less expensive.
U CNAT
In hindsight, that would be some painful tea to brew
i thought all this stuff was real!

F=F-FALCON PUNCH!
Before the chat flood, "I love the hipster chicks sexually"
i call em combos- pinkie pie
My theory: Everything after this is Scott's coma dream
He was actually cold-cocked by the emo
Patel's magic is weak yo, like Trixie
Ghirahim from Skyward Sword?
o-o
trixielol
CBrony29 BURN
Why does kim pine look so ugly compared to her graphic novel version?
Freezeframe, that actually makes too much sense
12in a group of really great friends that i've known for a long time, then being given the cold shoulder
scotts got the moves!
Patel sorta acts like Trixie too
/me offers Umbreon some help then if he wants it
This is so awesome that my balls hurt
he got them moves like jagger
I never thought you could overact that much through body-movement
FLASH KICK!
realize that scott essentially kills 7 people in this movie
Good combo
Trixie needs to be able to summon hipster chicks in season 2
I'm a pirate now, pirates are cool
12this is sadly something i have to help myself with
yeah I was the same but towards the end they just treat me as a toy of amusement then got bored of me
YOU ARE A PIRATE
don't forget that crash and the boys die aswell
I love how Scott's sister is like "everyone here is ca-razy"
SONIC BOOM!
You are a Pirate *yay*

scott's sister looks odd
And Celestia helps out with that

Scott's sister looks nothing like Scott
She's a bitch though, but still hawt
scott has a sister?

DON'T TAKE THE LEMONS SCOTT

ghosties speaks truth
implying it ain't julie
Nowai
Nymphadora Tonks, now rubble (as of the final movie)
Man am I an ice-cold motherfucker every now and then
With jet-packs........
oh god I am blind!
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk.
4Nymphadora Tonks is the hottest chick in the Harry Potter films
Time heals all wounds, Quick call the nearest Doctor! We found a cure for EVERYTHING!!!
At least Tonks' hair isn't green
lol, gay guy who looks like he could beat you up is ten times nicer than other gay guy
what's wrong with green hair?
I'd wreck Luna the most though
Cause she da cutest : 3
These wounds they will not heal.
its a rarity reference
green hair lets you screw the rules
4Luna's alright
i personally already have green hair
4But she's too much of an airhead
Silly Ghosties, that's not how you spell Galadriel
Metalluna isn't alright though.
@elky, not as much as money
LOL
And yet Kaiba was still able to screw the rule.
well yes
Ah, Wallace
FAAAAABULOOOUS
4Galadriel?
4Don't remember Galadriel
I love me some well-intentioned, non-bitchy, not-actually-stupid airheads
Luna's more of a Space Cadet and less of an airhead, too
FINISH HIM
nah luna lovegood and hermione, the best by far
FINISH HIM
sounds a lot like the producers of this movie
so not the line the gay guy should be saying
...whatever
PAWNCH
4Space Cadet? What?
eh
away with the farieis, etc.
4Luna's all kinds of spaced out, if that's what you mean
fuck i need to learn how to type properly
dat running
..
haha
4She "has her head in the clouds"
SPAAAACEEE
man, he is good at solving passwords
Luna seems alright to me
i love how all the passwords are correct
scott goes on a murderous rampage in 3...2...1...
Great hipster passwords.

Ghosties: it's how one describes those people that often have flights of fancy
Like Pinkie Pie

Piss Poorgrilm
4You know, I never really realized it until last night
U NO LIKE COKE?!?!
4But this movie is incredibly hipster
Coke Zero, now rubble
what?
WITH YOU
i'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum
I'd still fuck the shit out of Luna
castlevania music INCOMING!
wait, you didn't realize that?
and i'm all out of bubblegum
10This movie is terribly hipstery :P
!
nah, its too mainstream to be hipster
well you know how those hipsters can be ;)
"c'mon it's clear" O hai mark.
SCOTT EARNED THE POWER OF LOVE
He pulled a sword out of his chest....now that is origional
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
level up
4The weirder thing? I actually really, really enjoy this movie
also, I fucking hate how everyone thinks Duke Nukem came up with the bubblegum line
Scott used stabby stabby stabby, it's super effective
10XD
I wish they didn't have that much hipster appeal in this movie
oh wait hipsters not online...damn that was a wasted joke >.<
just figured out that noise is from sonic when you get a ring
hidden finger
4It was "They Live"
....wtf
it makes it a 6-7/10 at most
4And it was Roddy Piper's line
go scott! KILL KILL
$$$$$
It's more videogame than hipster
10interior_gummy.. it took you -that- long? ;D
castlevania when the sword smashes
4Right after getting the sunglasses
I know, That's the movie I'll pick if i ever win the lotto
so much murder
We need to watch They Live one week.
Yes, it was They Live, but Duke perfected it
You can make a movie about hipsters that isn't hipstery
STRAWBERRY ON THE SHORTCAKE
RainBroDash...yes
Killing, totally acceptable
Revolutionary Scott Utena
the Pony Community is the best
3fed up of not being able to see my own messages, so colour change time!
yeah, but hipsters have started stealing video games from the nerds
4The scene where Roddy puts on the glasses for the first time is one of the greatest moments in movie history for me
3or not...
so yeah
man, that sword sucks
Good afternoon, everyone.

4Actually, Gideon...

0I just noticed that if they have more mods, finding new colors will be hard

Hes the final boss that's why you got your ass kicked
double colors?
evil triforce
He's just too sexy.
0and I thought you were gonna post the ham banner
the solution is obviously gladiator fight to the death between mods
Purple`Prose = This can't be Davy Jones Locker. This movie is actually good.
Evil villains can't triforce yellow.
two mods go in, one color comes out
0we let commoners use colors (or make me a mod)?
eeeeeeeevil way he eats hay
0it's a double color all the way across the sky
Thank god Ganon doesn't have the evil Triforce

You should so. Totally. Cum.

He totally isn't Tom Cruise

What's this?!? SCOTT IS EVOLVING!
4I still think Michael Cera wasn't the best choice for Scott Pilgrim
phhhf, Darf14, Newgame+ duh...
0well you can still do the sidequests
4At least I don't think he fits the look
0you cant get an actor thats more awkward
OH SHIT NEGASCOTT
Nega Scott
NIGGA SCOTT
0nega scott
Legend of Zelda Evil Twin: Always relevant
SOLO ROUND!
4The guy who did Crash from Crash and the Boys would have been a much better fit IMO
Oh forgot Newgame+
why is he called nega scott?

0needs more goatee
LOL
Shadow Link > Dark Link
0didnt get to see that film :(
OMG it's CG micheal cera
slowpoke: the crack on the glasses is a 7
Michael Cers is a perfect choice in my eyes, but I can't see Scott Pilgrim as a real person anyway
Negative Scott.
LOLWUT
BONDING FOR THE WIN
Haha
evil scott
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING XD
HAT OUTAA NOWHERE
0suddenly,. hat
Normal Scott is a hipster douche, nega Scott is a generally decent dude
another triforce... what
If Link only talked to Dark Link then we wouldn't have to put up with that frustrating boss in Zelda 2
the benefits of a morally neutral character
"Nega/Negative" is one of the many, many words used for evil clones, doppelgangers, twins, and general lookalikes.
no ramona
dont go
NEGA SCOTT is too mainstream
4Scott actually becomes a good guy at the end of the series
4So, really, Nega Scott would be the Scott from the beginning of the film
it's Neighhhga scott!
Only think I don't like is that the movie strolls along for 2 hours, and then runs away with the ending in ten seconds flat
0this isnt a standalone film?
like 20 people died and became rubble for you woman..
is this the alternate ending :( ?
Nnnnope.
4The one thing I don't like, aside from Michael Cera being Scott Pilgrim?
reverse pedoscott
For the movie no, for the series yes
0i would be pedoscott
0all that hipster shit?
There's always New Game+
4It's still ScottxRamona
Ah crap, Big Brother is back.
Jonah Hill would've made a better scott pilgrim
6DAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Knives feels like too much of a little girl
boooooo.....knives is better
she has knives
DAT DOOR
The Social Network for BMN
True, she is way too cool for him.
aaawwwww
Indeed
Jonah Hill looks weird skinny
0ill be honest, im only here for the pony episode coming up
Dawyne Johnson would... wait, no, forget I even said it.
they have two Scotts, why not give each girl one of them?
0its one of my favourites XD
Oh **** I don't have a Quarter? Quick give me one!!!
4Any other hetero, canon pairing would have been better. ScottxKim or ScottxKnives would have been so much better
which pony to ship with scott?
Dwayne*
hey guise should we contuniue?
quick scott, into the tardis!!!
Too late
/me brohoofs Ghosties
Dash ofc
Scott doesn't deserves ponies
ScottxWallace.
0sooo, what happens until 9:30?
Scott deserves ponies
Scott Pilgrim as a pony
mfw
I can't read the credits
/me brohoofs Bjornfot
Scott x Nega Scott
Dash is definitely Ramona.
Everyone deserves ponies
wallacexwallace
0what bjornfot said
6ScottxYoung Neil
he can get the worst pony, twilight sparkle
Now it's time for ponies
ScottxGilda, see, no pony
Ponies now please
>.>
Until 9:30, I take a massive piss
4I said hetero, Bjornfot :D And *brohoofs ValtheJean*
well, thanks for that, whoever streams these.
Ghosties scott x knives was the alternate ending to this movie
I'm agreeing with DragonRage here
Ramona represents Scott maturing. Anybody else would have defeated the purpose of the journey
:D
Ghosties: Hetero is too manestream
Scott x Nega Scott, they have so much in common
fuck you twilight sparkle is awesome!
I thought it was f****** hilarious when Scott and Nega-Scott became friends
FIM needs an aloof douche pony.
i have yet to see a het fanfic of fim
aww yeah Scott x NegaScott
stop the swearing guys.
omg...my 6 month niece is over...brb I'm going to sing her the Dai-Guard intro
our credits, now blurry
bon-bon's a bitch.
PeanutButterWolf: It has. He's called Blueblood.
we need more douche ponies
I should totally edit the good deleted scenes in, along with the alt endding
Rarity's evil hipster geek twin, Obscurity.
Blueblood is alpha as fuck
trixieXblueblood?
He's never gonna be in the show again.
I know what would make this movie even better: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liu7o8BY6P1qa2xemo1_500.png
That's a strange way to spell Caramel HeavyMetalPony :P
Blueblood is 120% gay.
aww no image
gilda is dash's clingy ex
Bonbon is a fatass... wait a minute
scott looks fat as a pony :S
But I agree, need more douche ponies to make fun of
Well, this movie was my first reaction when I saw episode 5
that explains why he treated rarity so badly!
notice bon-bon is a bitch though.
too bad this track isn't in the game
0blueblood needs to return
yet fanonically she's well loved. lolwut.
bluebloodXrarity was briefly canon
:D
Elky you better be trolling
ART FROM THE GAME GO!!!
Snips... Snails... Blueblood... Jock ponies in Sonic Rainboom. There's a decent amount of douche ponies.
0eeenope
spikeXrarity is half-canon
dat 8 bit
Elky: And get introduced to the Ursa Major
blueblood isn't a real man.. i mean pony, a real pony is kind whit the lady
my ears have been raped this BMN
Ohai epic sprites
Bonbon was a bitch in MLP Tales
and I really hope nopony votes for him for our dating sim
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
yeah thats true- jock colts were douches.
8-bit Scott looks the same in the Game
SHAKE DAT HEALTHY FLANK

Elky, Blueblood is a total bottom.
0so what'll be shown until 9:30?
you're the banana king twilight!
is this part of the episode?
sapphire shoresXhoity toity
I bet NewDCD was making gokai references when knives appeared
"this movie has been rated PG-13". So great to know that after it's over!
0also, blueblood's segment was freaking hilarious
cumming
SO TWILIGHT IS A BITCH THAT LIKES BANANAS?
I only saw this episode twice
0fawk yeah
YOU KNOW MY NAME
Pony of POMP
implying 13 year olds would get any Nintendo references
rarity = lame
what episode is this?
Rarity just creamed herself.
@HeavyMetalPony indeed...tis a very sad thing
jitterhoof fact
she lacks a cutie mark?
/me climbs onto Aero's head

nah, she just paints over it
rarity lieks dat ass

did she say clothes horse or clothes whores?
So Elvis
:)
Needs more Diamonds
She dyes her coat and covers up the cutie mark to make herself seem more youthful.
and they they didn't forget Photo Finishes' cutie mark
Pony fashion is essentially: SHINYSHINYSHINY
rarity died
Rarity, now rubble
/me floofs out

Photo Finish has the exact same cutie mark as twilight

THE PONY OF POMP
Gay Stable? INTEREST PIQUED
she was jealous of fluttershy
ufff
then who's the pony of circumstance?
She Contradicted Herself!
Gay stable on the rise ......
0mare: incredibly valuable in earlier times, but dirt cheap now?
never jealous?...
quite in ore
ah yeah, pony time
rarity is NEVER jealous???
spike is a pervert
OM NOM NOM
Is he looking at Rarity or the jewels?
0nom
Gems aren't vegan?
HEY GUISE HOW COME THE DIAMOND DOGS CAN TALK BUT WINONA CAN'T?
they are vegan
rule of funny
companion diamond
I need rarity in minecraft.
Brain surgery.
dick shovel
same reasion goofy can but pluto cant
diamond dogs are maybe actually wolves?
you just need a pony that can do magic
magic
lol, id love to see rarity vs creeper
That tail can do just about everything
WAIT
Dick shovels ftw.
Someone said Wolves?
how can it be
0minecrafter rarity
who the fuck is creeper?
that there are these diamond dogs
who can talk
but
Applejack has a dog as a pet?!
anyone else hear Zelda music when she gave him that jewel?
now he will never be able to eat that diamond
if spike had to choose between gems and rarity...
Spike vs spyro- who wins?
dogs: banzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai
!
0there basically gollum, half human half dog i spose
0*half pony
Spike wins, Spyro has no pony friends.
Spike because Spyro's new design is horrible.
Eew, dirt
Which spyro?
If it's the old Spyro, then Spyro. If it's the new one, Spike would stomp him.
plot alert
0old spyro
I smell a plot
spyro has sparx robotpinkie
Old Spyro is always winrar.
VP Spiro Agnew
the ponyyyyyy
0old spyro>spike>new spyro
Not pony enough for me, sorry.
why did't they take them both, one to find one to dig.
the first spyro was awesome
spike need to learn karate
nasty norc was a push over though.
rapists!
Wii hunt
Though I do love the early Spyro games
Spike needs to earn the power of love
who would win: spike or madame le flour
Old spyro is so good, I wish I could play it again
ITS A TRAP!
That dog is a spy!
0i was 4 when that game came out, i never got to nasty norc
SPIKE EARNED THE POWER OF LOVE
Spike, with his flame breath
dat was the raper said!
Ripto's death traumatized me
I wish I could play it again too
Spyro was only good in like, the first three games.
Dang, if she only had wings
or the power of self respect
the ending to the first spyro was disappointing
also the faun from Spyro 2 made me a furry.
ahh dirt
I was like "after all that, a tv interview? SERIOUSLY..."
Rarity has been kidnapped!
DAMN YOU SALAZAAAAAAR!
0never saw the ending for the first spyro
ther's no stopping the vortex spike
Just me or does the big Diamond dogs sound like gutsman?

These dogs played too much Minecraft
Nah I've played a lot of Final Fantasy 13, there's only one tunnel, trust me.
SSSSSSSSSSSsssssssss
0she came
lol Pinkie
Both Luna and Pinkamina need to be friends with Rocky in season 2.
4There's no such thing as too much Minecraft
stupid FF13 wasting my life...
but.... if celestia is god, who is "gosh"?
thanks, combustible
Sharing the same delusion
FO-REV-ER
^^^^^This
0inb4 this is whining
I hated Hope so much.
Hopefully FF15 will be awesome
Convenience!
meh, I doubt it
....I can't keep a straight face even while typing that...
plot
Trollity
they've had 2 failed MMOs, and 12 and 13 were utter shit
I watch it for the plot
DICK
FOREVERRRR
or is it Raritroll?
Rarity is best pony
dat digging
as far as I'm concerned, Final Fantasy ended at 10
12 wasn't that bad
FF13 - walk down a hallway for +20hrs until you get to the real game
0egh...egh..uhhh..
But FF10 was good, Val
4I watch it...for the whining
DICK
Raritroll works
FF12 was fine. Just less bitchy characters.
DICK
oh I agree
DAT FAIL DIGGING
hence why 10 was the end of FF
but 12 was shit
FF12 was the last good FF to me. And even then, that game's battle system gets old fast.
PONI PEDI
Balancing was shit in FF12, though.
She's not actually failing, blocks
4Final Fantasy X is the last great Final Fantasy game
You just need to pay attention to the story, since it wasn't easy to follow
12 was just an utter fail of trying to implement an MMO system into a single player game
Agreeed Ghosties
Loved the gambit thing, very KoTOR of them in general, but it was just not fleshed out.
Rarity would be useful as a Diamond finder, but would suck in Minecraft's most important action: Digging
and the gambit system was INCREDIBLY glitchy
for a second there, i thought he was going to say "oh fuck godness"
0inb4thisiswhining
The cave is still prettier than Metaluna
why dog command dog?
Final Fantasy X-2 was cool.
SMEEEEELLL
I mean, sure the Materia system was pretty abuseable, but god damn the Gambit system failed
Ah. Mystery solved. It's your breath.
ENOUGH|
X-2 had the best battle system
X-2...was interesting
in equestria no one like pants?
Guard dogs, now rubble
I mean, I appreciate them experimenting with the dressphere system
That's the proof of trolling.
Lira likes pants
but it just felt like too much fanservice
Anyone remember the massage minigame?
no, you're a mare
oh god
i like how the leader of the diamond dogs sounds like snips.
Next episode, Rarity finds African blood diamonds
the massage
0TTHIIIIS ISS WHIIIINNING
inb4 best part
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<3
0best part
oh shit
Blood Diamonds without DiCaprio?
Pro Whiner
I love the hoofstomping.
0but i thought you wanted whining
So that's where This Island Earth got its soundtrack
hoofstomp
Dat death glare.
HeavyMetalPony HAS ANYONE MADE BLOOD DIAMOND TRAILER WITH RAIRTY
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINING
Rarity is so awesome in this episode.
anything?
lol
I dunno
did anyone notice that mule sound?
this cave, now rubble
Raritroll is best troll pony
they play a mule noise as she mentions complaining
You fool, never say anything to anyone! *shivers*
these dogs, now rubble
RARITY used MANIPULATION
never caught that before
quiet
ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE!
dog are stupid
Better than Trollestia and Trolluna combined
Celestia will send you to the moon
You are all peadges! and such
Men?
I mean hi
:>
I have to admit this has become one of my favorite episodes
of dogs and men
my purple drank
4 l
0this is a marmite episode
Dat spank!
0either it makes you lvoe or hatee rarity
Why would anybody hate this episode? :(
So if Celestia's molesting persona is called Molestia, is Luna's molesting persona, if she has one, called Moluna?
:(
poor mule
0my fellow brony dislikes this episode
MARSHMELLOW
I'd pay to get to spank Rarity <_<
mule-racism
poor rarity
This episode is awesome
rarity is racist against mules
Mallow from SMRPG kinda sucked
It's all an act.
Rarity at her best
Remember Rarity wasn't offended by having her butt slapped. Only by being called a mule.
That's good and well, but can her whining save Metaluna?
i broke the game by using the lazy shell on peach
she never dies, and has infinite healing powers
inb4 Fuck 'em up
AJ is baws
Metal Luna is perpetually screwed anyway given that its population sucks balls
0getting stuck on pinkie would be ultra hard mode
that episode are perfect for the rule 34 *TROLLFACE*
0she bounces for a living
0yay whinney
Rezo: But Rarity is a dominatrix!
spike's sexual fantasy intro
Twilight is totally Spike's adoptive mom
Spike is going all out on his Fantasy
Rarity, I'm in lesbians
shoot stars coming out of its ass, and fuck 'em up. Applejack is best pony
they can make horse sounds?
Dat Whinny!!
I'm definitely in lesbians with this show.
They've always been able to make horse sounds.
no
No u
the other l word
Likewise, RobotPinkie.
Yes, they can
router needs to stop being a dang fagtard
0how the hell do they all ahve the strength to pull that amount of stuff

They 're ponies
Strong ponies are strong
I like Twilight. =/
boom
0twilight is worstpony of mane 6
i kinda like Twilight...
/me likes Twilight
so it's not just me?
whew

She taught Twilight that Whining can get you anything
10You're all wrong!
0but they all rock
/me 7likes Twilight
k lol
there is no worst pony
Twilight is second best pony after rarity
twilight > Applejack
Twilight is best nerdy pony
Rainbro, I think you'll like what I have in store for Twilight in my story
then the server needs to stop being etc
i like fluttershy
theres only two kinds of Ponies:
Dear Princess Celestia, being a total bitch fucking works. Men are so easily manipulated. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
I wuv all ponies
Rarity is best pony, but other 5 are awesome, too.
Everypony is best pony.
Shores wants half eaten gems
^
Applejack and Pinkie Pie
Twilight is awesome, but has no likeable scenes in this episode
and then everyone else
Some are just more best than others.
4Ghosties likes all of main cast
0dragonrage: yes
Rainbow > Other Mane 5
interior_gummy fact
oh noes
I get bored of fluttershy
/me brohoofs DragonRage
I teh lost deh steramz
Freieieeieie- *cuts off*
THATS IT?
Rainbow is second worst pony after Pinkie Pie
Best pony? Worst pony? DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE
And then they all died the end
pinkie is best pony
no outro?
4WELL THAT'S IT EVERYBODY
6I'd do postshow, but I still have no youtube.
cmon!
0well thats that
Applejack was my first pony
4:D

So we're going offline till robot time?

*revives Robotpinkie*

Well then, good night everybody. 'twas a blast as always.

7I might be testing some stuff in a bit
Luna > Pinkie > Rarity
So Sprinks, are you done streaming?
we should totally do a BMN-Game night until the robots
whens robot?
inb4 everybody leaves
WAIT! this is equestria! all the ponies are the besto ponies
10Actually yeah. Applejack is so bad. Although Rarity is worst pony. Basically Rarity is worst of mane 6, Applejack is 2nd worst, then Twilight. Inb4 RBD is just wrong. NO U
Oh, phew... thanks Barry, thought I was a goner there
What robots?????
RBD U TROLL
APPLEJACK IS THE BST
GIANT robots

TWILIGHT IS ADORKABLE

but the Macross Movie
Rainbro, in my story, I plan to have Twilight fall under Nightmare Moon's control for a time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ91DK9tpcs&feature=related
Japanese giant robots
and Megas XLR I remember
Vikings are misunderstood, RBD. =/
some gundam series
transformers are japanese
Indeed
0anyway, imma go now i guess
As a texan, I believe Applejack plays to Southern stereotypes a little too strongly at times
and then...something with an E
10Sathi I was born silly.
I can't remember
0untill next time ^^
Hey, I saw that game on this stream before
Oh, that's true, some Amerrkin robots too

Sometime in future, epic Brony coop. Too bad I don't play WoW anymore, a 25-man brony raid sounds like fun.
applejack has more of an oklahoma accent anyway
@RobotPinkie had cataclysm not caused me to quit, I'd totally have supported that

@Elky There can only be one president, they must fight for it.....TO THE DEATH
haven't seen Arthas, don't care.
it was a really fun fight
the cinematic at the end was lame
but the fight mechanics were solid
Rainbow Dash for President
*nostalgia sigh* I remember my first LK down...
0well, that's what we determined in the hurt&heal thread waaaay back
Because she's the only one who would pilot a mecha in defense of the US
Haha
Yeah I dunno, I'm pretty happy with not playing it anymore
so no postshow until 9:30?
0just making sure: 2 hours until robots?
@gummy that's a maybe. Sathi may or may not be testing something

if I had L4D2, I'd totally suggest you stream it while we play :P
bye Ghost- too late
7you should totally get it

if it goes on sale again, I probably will
unfortunately I blew most of my "non-college fund" money on League of Legends >.<
7err..did you buy champs
stupid LoL being my gateway to stop the WoW addiction...
skins <.< >.>
and champs...
7errr..
oh god I'm pathetic
/me 7nods
:(
though I also got the additional rune pages
that was a really practical buy
Y U YOU BUY THINGS THAT YOU COULD GET BY PLAYING THE GAME MORE?
I'd suggest some hardcore SP playing
7I quit LoL already
oki gonna idle till night of the liveing robots.
well, because you can't get skins with IP :P
I'm a skin addict
I mean champs
0so I heard LoL was similar to DotA
0what would you pay for?
7it is
well the champ purchases were for new releases, like Ori or Jarven
also theres exp boosts
and it was just cost effective to get the skin pack
thats how they get ya
not a fan of microtransactions...
7micro transactions ftw..
on the plus side
7even aoc got it
7and they make tons of money on it
I spend SIGNIFICANTLY less on LoL than I do on WoW
always ends up costing more
oh it's great for the publisher, no doubt.
eeyup
I just wish Riot would spend more time on game balance than on shoveling out new champs...
7miss fortune I loved her :( until she got nerfed to the ground
7then I quit :D
she's still really solid
I main her
well...I main like half the champions
but still
she is still a very solid carry
When I used to play I used Amumu
and ever since the Corki nerf, she's right up there again
it's a shame they ruined Noc and Yorick...they were my favorites
Ill be back for giant robot time
I like Pong, that's a good competitive game.

^read that one
But seriously,i'm sure i can stomach it.
the knights of Ray say nini!
I didn't read it (not because of the grimdark) but because I refuse to read fanfic in general
night ray~
Oh god that's nasty, why man, why?
bye Ray
I read fanfics if they spark my interest.
same
same
Likewise. Still need to read Past Sins, though. I keep putting it off.
Well it's not like i needed sleep tonight anyway.
But I also write fanfics
and then change their name to unintelligable random sylables
I don't care for Past Sins.inb4 shitstorm
what's yer name, Anon? Got a username you use?
it might just be the elitism that comes with the territory (which ironically I try to avoid) but as an english major I can't stomach fanfics
hai
lol
Partly because I've been writing my own stuff and don't have time, partly because I don't really care about Nyx, but mostly because of Team Fortress 2.
no, new here
(oh snap. Don't mention TF2 near Val.)
TF2
TF2
lol
Welcome to Team Fortress 2.
o.o
my comp wont let me play tf2 :(

just I will voice my disdain for said game :P

My only complaint is that my team mates always run off whenever they see me distracting an enemy sentry.

Anyone here a fan of Homestuck?
I love homestuck
02Kthxbaaaai~
I'm not familiar

kanpyre is best troll
Guys,i hope Bjornfot didn't cause too much trouble when i was gone.
speaking of which Monty Python And The Holy Grail is available on DVD in the US again
I've pretty much avoided most things Homestuck related. Not too interested in it, really.
novacoru, but surely that honor goes to pantskat?
Monty Python And The Holy Grail BD may also be coming soon yay!!
if not for the first time ever
gabe newell is a baus

Homestuck seems like a lot of work to get into
what's your patron troll?
Aradia
I have no Blu-Ray drive either
I have no plans to buy one either
Elky: its totally worth it
I do
no movies on the format interest me much
elky, oh yes it is, but worth it if you can get into the story.
which is why I'm not really keen on getting into it
hm
i like my trols like i like my ogres dead and looted
because i want mah HDz, and i have internet caps,
The format doesn't interest me at all
not sure if I have the needed free time
rent BD for $1, copy/watch, yeah
STUPID COMPUTER! Y U TAKE MY MASS SPOTS???
elky, the best way to describe it, is that it's kind of like doctor who, mixed with final fantasy, at least that's how i'd sum it up.
i dont care for eather of those things
spam the chat room (like a baus)
clop to fanart (like a baus)
make a sandwich (like a baus)
lolwut
the issue here is lack of interest
hit the sauce (like a baus)
DVD is working fine
oh gummy, u such a parasprite :P
plus most Blu-Ray releases these days are on DVD too
anon: that doesn't me much of a clue since I don't know either of those
quick get a tuba
i have never clopped to ponies, thankfully (just humaniz-i mean humans)
04Drake hi :3

4get kicked (like a baus)
am I in time for the giant robot event they talked about last night?
xD
nicely done
lol
ELKY, okay well imagine that but without the evil exes plot, time travel, and a bit of lord of the rings, style plot.
okay...
sorry, i'm horrible at summaries
hmm...am I late?
...dose not conpute
no
for the main stream? yes. For robots? no
0hit on deborah (like a baus)
I'mma play some TF2.Seeya all tommorow!
What was the main stream?
3get kicked again (like a baus)
ah, good to know.
I guess I'll read a bit, then see if it's good for some reading on the side
I would laugh if dari's script included a permaban
I doubt dari would do it
ELKY, if your going to read it, I should mention that the plot is a little wierd, up until you start chapter 2.
you gotta admit it'd be hillarious
so when are robots?
forever!!!1
in about an hour, give or take
I'm a little slow on the uptake, could someone explain the whole robot thing to me, please?
basically
LOTS and LOTS of Anime robot episodes
Cool
A robot is a mechanical intelligent agent which can perform tasks on its own, or with guidance. In practice a robot is usually an electro-mechanical machine which is guided by computer and electronic programming. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and come in those two basic types: those which are used for research into human-like systems, such as AS
0hey, how is the new transformers cartoon?
ok not to great
ELKY, thanks for that, i needed a good laugh.
lol
ohai Drake
0hmm...what is the second best show on the hub?
whats up
but the transformers is ok its good anuff to watch but i prefer the old school stuff
Thanks.
but there both good
so what is robot night?
a night were thay become selfaware
04The roof
quick find john conner
Robot Night is the night wherein we all become androids.
sudden confusion
I for one look forward to it.
meto i need new arms anyway new legs too
so robot night is basically borg rave night?
is there like, a robot movie?
he's streaming the Macross movie
so yes
robot anime from what iv heard
mmkay
04Anyone know a TV channel that's, I dunno, worth watching?
brb need buritos
0i'll just come back for robots
anyone know what the best art programme would be, to imitate the colouring style of mlp?
Flash
sorry i'm a bit computer illiterate, is that just adobe, or is there another website I have to go to?
04Good answer :P
Guys, Suited for Success was meant as a Take That to Executive Meddling, did you know that?
Animal Planet?
I'm just thinking
and just realized
Aang is a fucking selfish cunt
I can see why it would be interpretted as such...but I didn't get the feeling the executive board was THAT meddlesome
at least, they were certainly less meddlesome than pretty much ANY other show
Sometimes they are
I mean with how the others pressured Rarity into making the dresses the way they wanted
well Faust commented a lot on how they were very workable
oh I see, you mean in general
Whom got a Deus Ex Machina excuse to not man up, drop some balls and decide to actually save the world from a genocidal-mad man whom was about to slaugter millions
as in, not directed towards Hasbro
Right
or rather gain common sense
ooookay, gotcha
04Oh, is our time for character-bashing already?
heh, it's funny how you capitalize the trope names
At least I'm the type of person who watches the show and notices the flaws
and not the guy who goes
'FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT WONT DARE WATCH IT IN MY LIFE'
First, she created the dresses the way she thought it would be. She then brought in a test audience, and when they were rejected, she sought out their advice to make them better. We know how disastrous that became
thought they should be*
I even went back and watched the MLP series of the 80s when I was watching FiM
..Never watch it
NEVER

i like it
and Selene is another name for the moon, as is Luna
lol cool
therefore, Sarah Selene = Princess Luna. a
i was so happy when i realized it
7great idea !
11 Minutes
Is that the name Luna takes when she goes undercover in Progress?
Yep
that is the name, yes
Thought I recognised it
well, Selene is
speaking of which, I'm waiting on the next chapter
7I never knew Sarah means Princess :O
Selene was a mythological being who was on the moon
Actually, Selene was a Greek moon goddess
yeah, sarah is Hebrew for Princess
I believe Selene is Greek for moon
daughter of Hyperion and Theia
err, that's what i meant. thanks, forgot it was greek
and I thought Artemis was the main Greek moon goddess
Seth thinks that cotton is made from sheep
Artemis shares the moon
harvest moon
Or is she just associated with the moon?
There's Artemis, Selene and Hecate
Percy Jackson and the Olympians never mentioned a Selene
I guess she's not that well known
mfw the only reason I even knew about the Selene = moon thing is because of Princess Luna's original concept name, and the song My Selene
It mentioned Artemis and Hecate, but not Selene
there is an old love story about Selene
Endymion was in love with Selene
and i don't remember what else happened
ugg gotta love geting on new meds my head hurts and im back and forth to the bathroom
nice...

Go get some :D
agreed
What I've seen of Big O I've loved
the only big O I've seen is from SRW, needless to say I enjoyed it :P
/me gives Nick a can of Budwieser
big o showtime
wait...is the stream up?
Big O is what would happen if Batman the Animated Series was a super robot show
yes
03EW BEER
/me just stares
that's...weird
big is batman robot
it shows as offline for me
I BE MISSING TEH ROBAWTS
It's Civillian Batman with a Mecha. What's not to love
no yes to purple
stream not on yet
oh
I hope Big O is dubbed
04I should keep writing...
I should go back to coding, but I'm feeling lazy
the eps we're watching, I mean
EW BUDWEISER
04XD
Then again I blame the Gym for that
Is it safe to link the opening of Big O?
/me takes a bottle of Black sheep instead
Fine Nick! >:(
04"Do we have to drink Budweiser?" "No. That stuff is carbonated cow urine."
9my source is Dual Audio
^^^^^^^^
9I'll let you guys decide that
9so go ahead and discuss it
I like that idea :P
idc eather way
04I'm 15 so I wouldn't know what it tastes like XD
Does your source have the opening theme/credits?
12LOL some youtube comments amuse me
/me quite happily drinks the Whiskeh
04Should I:
04A) continue the summary
04or
12"WHY IN EVERY GAME IS JIRACHI SLEEPING" I think it amused me more than it should but LOL
04B) write the character profiles?
9it does
I choose
...............
Option
B
04Okay
I mean, if the English VA's do a good job, then sure. But more often than not they don't
so going with the original VA's is usually a good thing in my book
0410,401 words in the plot summary
04My god.
04inb4 it's over 9000
Big O's english dub is excellent
I don't mind but I personally prefer the Dub of Big O. There's something about it that appeals to Western sensibilities more
It's OVER 10,000!!!
/me shot
04XD
Gravion's, from what I've heard....isn't
well, so long as you can assure the Dub is good I'm fine with it
New youtube poop. Go!
though in the end it's up to DCD :P
eeyup
Just my opinions
ohai sprinkles
6Hey.
9sounds like most people would like the Dub
9Dub it is
Dub?
for Big O?
BIG O!!! SHOW TIME!!!!
Big O? I could go either way,
Let's have some epic robot watching in 15 minutes.
9everything is set
9just keep the thread bumped
About 15 minutes till SHOW TIME!!!
9also Sprinkles

9Sprinkles
Oh ffs not again -.-

9http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36564145.html
Though I'm actually getting to point where I'm going to take my swords in hand and find these rioters myself, I'm getting sick of them -.-

04Remember the Law of Conservation of Ninjutsu./
04brb
lolk
oh damn it...my trip isn't stored on this machine
need to get my email >.<
9Razyn: because it would help us garner more viewers
9that, and the schedule was never a secret LOL
also because Megas is epic
hell yeh
NewDCD = You're stealling my lines on Ponychan
That and I suggested it
Oh I know. In context, it sounded like Megas had a Japanese dub.
04back
wb
9now go forth, my minions!
9go forth and spread the word of Giant Robot Saturday Night!
9to your fellow bronies!
Definitely watching the Macross movie, dunno if I'm watching aught else

So few bronies, I hope more join later...
9Edward
I just told my sister and her friends thru Facebook
9go on and spread the voice!
I SHALL MY CAPTAIN
I'm not a big Macross fan, but I'll stick around for all the other awesomeness
macross? man that takes me back. remember watching it back in the 80's when i was in my 60's. god, i'm so old.
just put a link up on the brony page DCD
>feels accomplished
I linked it on another chat I frequent
how old are you??

Have you tried advertising to Equestria Daily?4

no offence
hmmm
Riders, I was gonna do that, but this isn't really ponies.
I feel old a lot lately
Being 26
ah the bad old days
yeah i havent seen a vhs since i was a kid
Wat
WAT
WAT
Mojo on Synctube runs weekly film animation marathons devoid of Ponies that get advertised just because it's a pony themed channel
/me has four VHSs a little under his laptop
i haven't seen an 8 track since i was a kid
lol
Captain NewDCD, I have spread the word to my fellow bronies.
Less than 5 minutes till SHOW TIME!!!

9good job, soldier
04My thoughts exactly
As have I my Captain *bows and backs out of room*
NewDCD sensei, should I send this event to EqD?
9Razyn: to the chat. I don't think Sethisto would post us with such a short notice
lol damn you DCD!
9and quite frankly I don't want to reach the user cap either
9it's bad form

Do I need to know anything about Macross?

Give em the old, Razzle Dazzle
It's an anime about MUSIC, LOVE AND FIGHTER JETS

Wow. This song seems a bit brutal to be sung in such a cheery tone.
I dont want no plot
I can tell, DCD
9Val: never got the chance...should DL the GC version

INTERRUPTION

Note to self: Do not play TF2 while waiting for the stream to start.
SDF1 should TOTALLY be a capital ship in SRW

How about giving her the lyrics
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOUR EMO ASS!
I want his model

TOTALLY ISNT YOU
DAMN
just kidding
LIES
LAWL J/K
u mad?
THATS A JOKE
that would make minmay ranka then.
It's a joke
Bjornfot, i heard that you were going to cameo me in your game
:D
minmay is just his mistress
That was a joke, ha-ha, fat chance.~
It's like Spider-Man if Gwenn Stacy returned from the dead
HER PUSSY WAS JUST TOO GOOD I GUESS
watch out rick she is useing that crying theng again
AND THEN THEY FUCKED
Riders: You mean like all those times she did?
But anyway, this cae is great, so delicious and moist o/`
I thought I already told you, SilverMane. There's gonna be an easter egg with you and RBD.
...AGAIN
zombie gwen? hot
im so happyill cry
Minmay's just my sugar Momma, you're the one I love
9and that's why Hikaru Ichijo is totally not Scott Pilgrim. He's not a douche, he just doest know how to handle women.
Like a boss
Poor Minmay
9also
Bjornfot, if you want something to just confuse the fans, you should add some SilverMare and MirthTinker bondage.
COCK BLOCK

Wait, so, who's side are we on?
The first movie was a lot better than the first movie
red team has chalended.
Not getting ourselves killed.
The Zentradi are apparently on our side
the first movie was better live
Bjornfot: How were you going to do Silvermane and RainBroDash to begin with? Is it just profile images you need?
...or not
how do you not mean that in a dirty way lol
It's a 1v1v1
not my place to ask, nvm
...whoa do I seriously need to be on this chat just to make a clone?
Oh hai Silvermane.
SURPRISE THEY WERE FAKING IT THEYRE STILL ASSHOLES

Bjornfot, i'll see what I can do
CriticKitten = But where will the women go now?
So, Bjornfot, what's this about a game? Seems intredasting.

...oh shit I totally forgot there was gonna be stuff AFTER this movie.
Why are we looking at his feet?

RainBroDash, the pony generator... Are you too good for it?
RainBroDash: We're trying to copy the art style pf the show as much as possible.
Space battle
7HMM...

SPace orbot?
/me 7waits for Arti tomorrow about her thought.

why is this one window not shielded?
SYMBOLISM!!!!!! \o/
You think they would aim AT the ship
shield got blowen off
Someone please make a gif of that slap
not around it
When did they leave the ship?
they are shooting at other things IGL
They didn't
10Razyn I used it. But RainBroDash is practically a male Rainbow Dash... Which means difficult hair.
9TIME FOR THIS SHIT TO GET EPIC
they're in front of a window
but it's space, beams don't stop

Bullshit, there's no way that would happen in real life
Taste weaponized J-Pop motherfuckers!!

9I actually really like this song
03so she asked me
you do that RBD, it's kinda pixelly
03and then told me my dad must have been hiding it.
It's like the only decent song she's ever sung.
10IKR
9and yes, it is called "Do You Remember Love?"
03so my dad got mad at her for telling me
LOL
lawl dat decapetation
Wow, that guy got fucked up
Most of the songs in Macross are pretty awesome.
RainBroDash, it's fine. Really.
SUDDENLY
DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOON
03and of course the two of them are now fighting about it
Wat
10T.T
Did I see a head?
9BROLIENS
Do You Remember PUBERTY LOVE

Is it a drug of sorts, if I may ask .v.
that one way to get ahead
6ah
03um
Bjornfot: So corny it's awesome.
7How egregious is the argument?
03sigh
talk about getting your beauty sleep
SORRY WE JUST FIRED OUR ROCKETS AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE.TRUCE?
03should I just say it :/

BEHOLD THE POWER OF WEAPONIZED J-POP
so it's a double double double cross?
9OHAI AGAIN MAX
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE!
so is max the new colgate?
7How bad was their argument?
Friendship is magic mother fuckers
ok, what side is max on in this version?
What's stopping him from betraying them again?
hell yeh
So, Max gets with the one Meltrandi there?
The only way that I'm going to buy this is if I find out Minmay is the Music Meister's long lost twin
I hope this movie adds the one thing it's been missing so far.
Riders: Descendent
6you dont have to say it unless you want to, I understand just from what you've said
9AWWWW YEAH THIS PART
I love how calm this song is, compared to the death going on.
I better fucking see Macross punch an enemy ship and fire a billion missiles into it.
9HIKARU PULLS A LUKE SKYWALKER.
I love the MMM attack.
03well, it hasn't turned into one YET, it was more the two of them avoiding each other all dayl.
03-l
So, wait, they're killing the other guys anyway?
03but obviously an argument is bound to happen
9DIS SCENE
Beamspam McMuppet would be proud.
9AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I missed most of the movie, so all of this is just pretty explosions for me.
They are killing the BAD other guys
9BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE
no, they're killing the guys who gave the order to slauther hundreds of thousands of people
FreezeFrame = Technically it's 2010, so that wouldn't quite work
03because apparently my mom caught my dad doing the same thing like 10 years ago and she said a huge argument ensued bakc then
heres johny!
03and he obviously didn't stop :/
Ah
7Hmm.
I watched the movie and it's still just pretty explosions for ME
Forgot the timeframe of Macross
I DONT GET THIS MOVIE

This just further proves:
When did this turn into Heavy Metal?
03I have no idea.
He died
03He was pretty irked that I found out.l
Veritechs are the best mother fucking robots ever

9Dear Princess Celestia,
and the SDF1 is the ONLY capital ship worth a damn
03which quite frankly, I was kinda surprised, I didn't think my dad did anything bad like that
J POP SAVES THE WORLD
Must have been a load bearing head in a jar.
9Today I learned that, should aliens invade us, our best chance against them is to have Sweetie Belle sing.
Load-bearing villain destroyed!
03I knew about him drinking like 2-3 beers a night :/
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT
9Your faithful student, New DCD
and that everyone digs giant robots.
and then white stuff?

I now know how to defeat the Reapers come Mass Effect 3 time. Thanks Macross
Sad to hear that your father has been keeping secrets from you :|

so every one else outside just gave up then?
Someone's going to get some SERIOUS poontang
/me 9still loves this movie
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
augh
So Vocaloid is what we need against the Reapers?
Is that sound of joy or pain
yes
Both.
Good question
I HATE VOLCALOID
9but Vocaloid is Deculture
ok, cool

he chooses the sky....wait that was alto

He chooses the magic bicycle

OH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY IF SHE GAVE HER THE FINGER
03um

Not fully swaying me over to Macross, but easilly the best I've seen of the franchise so far
9in which Hikaru becomes an SDF Captain for the MEGAROAD-1
9and then their ship dissapeared in space
zentradi always on drums
everypony likes getting kicked
9I might stream Macross Plus and later maybe Frontier

YES
one of my ZNC servers went down
I love the battle scenes from Zero
zentradi on drums. dat bass
BUT YOU WILL NEVER STOP THIS ALLIGATOR
9brb going to get a glass of water
7Really, my parents don't like each other at all now; the only reason they're together is because of taking care of the house and kids and financially.
No Macross 7?
apparently someone or something killed the process
/me wants me some of 'dat Russian captain again
INTERSTELLA 5555 WOULD BE AWESOME
Macross 7 is utterly gonzo
its like Across the Universe but cooler
best credits ever
I never got 7 at all
03do you have siblings?
good thing i can read german
I tried to watch 7.
TTGL beats the manure out of this and everything else
Macross 7 just wasn't that good
But fuck Basara, seriously.
Where musicians that pilot jets with electric guitars fight space vampires
when i was a kid this was like the greatest thing ever. /sigh
TTGL gets you high on life
7That's what my statement would imply.
03why do you have to be so secretive LOL
6she wasnt LOL
FLY INTO SPACE AND SING AND PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHT
TTGL is good, but not the be-all-end-all
04hey Roara~
03well "yes" is a lot easier to type than what she said
yes PP
9kay back
mecha wise it does it 4 me
9skip credits?
WB
we watched this movie on the trip over on the titanic.
9also what Purple said
no dcd
0Gurren Lagann is easily my favorite Mecha anime
No credit-skipping
7Yes, but you don't know how many or who. :P
real men watch teh credits
TTGL is seriously fun, but yeah, other stuff is great too.
DCD, you do realize now that if you stream SRW again I'm going to force you to bring out more Veritechs :P
9Gurren Lagann was a GREAT tribute, but it's not the greatest thing ever
my favorite movie as a kid was fox and the hound, i think
I bet two
/me shot
TTGL is awesome, but you don't always want PURE HOT-BLOODEDNESS
03again, why be so secretive? :P
FULL METAL PANIC?
Don't remind me of that movie, gummy
9Val: if that's the case I should start streaming Alpha Gaiden instead
favorite movie as a kid, hmm... dark crystal maybe.
9because in Z all of the Valks have the same attacks
not the greatest thing ever, but way better than any other mecha anime
I wasn't that big on robot anime until I watched TTGL
That poor fox :(
dude, I would seriously show you some serious man love
I disagree
So it did that for me at the least.
How about gunbuster 2 if you want random.
because SDF1 = greatest capital ship ever
7It's the internet. :3
I have a Wave Veritech model that I should work on while I watch this
So everyone, answer me this
what is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Baby don't hurt me
I'm new school all the way and I wouldn't put Gurren Lagann in my top 10 of any given anime
