boss mode activated!
This is the best old man fight that I have ever seen *eats popcorn*
And thus he hits another person in the head with his cane.
I think I said that last time, too.
Right, and?
PUNCH THE SWORD!
STAY >:U
This has been another episode of, Retired badasses
The cane is mightier than the sword
BE LIKE DEATHSTALKER
Cone of shame!

Rellek, every villain's downfall is when they have the good buy at gunpoint and deliver a monolouge.

/me yawns also.
Squirrel!
by the power of greyskull
arent we going to end up with 1 room that only has 3 people in it?
=w=
hey guys lets NOT shoot the baloons and down the house
also AE, SC :3
6We can change the cap mid-stream
10just make it only apply to the first room?
Pixar! Steampunk! NOW!
13I totally did NOT forget
13I was just
10so we have 250 and 253?

Crazy Old Bastard goes into a rage
Oh hai there gun.
6They would be.
finally a gun
Look out hes packing heat
QUICKTIME EVENT GO
6It's just to keep from constant turbochat.
10hm
He's evil because he's a murderer.
Gun's are very rare to appear on a animated film.
He tried to send a kid plummeting to the earth
/me yawns and takes a nap on Jet's head
he evil because he's trying to kill the protagonists
and chop an old man in half
You're in my sights! You're going down!
yup
HA
owo
fuuuuuuuuuu
Curse you balloons@!
How many rooms are we talking?
I... can't... looooooooose!
needed more balloon
4Did he died?
6Six? :D
Adventure awaits you... ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET DOWN
we can also react accordingly. For example, we can expect the Rainbow Dash room to hit more traffic.
Don't worry. He was still tied to some balloons.
KILL MY IDOL
CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!
LIKE A BOSS
10...
It all comes full circle, Espy.
Furthermore! There is also another vital part of my plan!
bye bye house
he survives, lands in equestria
Purple'Prose: YEEAAAAAAAAH!
*gasp* :O
6Six mane mods, six mane ponies, six rooms.
Yeeeaaah
fly into the sun!
OBJECTION!
like a boss
I'm not talking about six rooms to start with...
think*
6Well, we /could/
ROFL
6LOL WUT?
also, i think the plan was 2 main mane mods per room
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN EQUESTRIA
lol
*Cue Objection!2004.mp3*
mane*
Thirded
lol
Wut?
And the Great Fox takes off

6Poking our heads in and whatnot.
I present you this Medal of Honor
also
a shitty plastic medal
Waaaaht?
10it makes me sadface splitting mods into seperate rooms
inb4 Woah
"You have saved me from the ninjas, dudes! Want to go get a burger?
this is a minor thing
CALL OF DUTY OLOLOLOLOLOL
"
but
woah
daaaaaaw
10just saiyan, i see it's necessary
A bottle cap, *salutes*
D'awww
Apparantly he never washed up between now and leaving
then just us a normal balloon
we should have a pic of Celestia that links to the mod room
you would have to type in a password and such still
BLUE
A room with no limits?
No moderation?
a compromise between steering and floating ability doesn't work
You're joking
hmmmm
Everyone would go there
i dunno about that
... T____T
THE END
6That's not a good idea...
10it would be like a /b/ room
Ow. My heart.
that house crushed all his furniture
then they fucked
FRENCH!
consider the following scenario
=/
how?
that seems like it could backfire horribly
10sorry to kinda shoot it down, but bah D:
That's no blimp...
0__o
0I want a dirigible. :(
10Great film :)
this is where they need to show Muntz trudging through the jungle all like 'Next time Gadget, NEXT TIME!!!"
Is this all in french?
And an army of talking dogs
We wouldn't get any real viewers in the other rooms
6Everypony would go there...
Wut?
Hold It!
Me too Espy, me too...
No, sorry
oops I mean Zip-line.
10dari just because there was no suicide
No hold out
especially since by then we would have our own website with a domain name
Espy, same.
That's just a bad idea
i agree Elky
copypasta song is boring
novaeu
That's a Zeppelin.
but otherwise, it was good
I mean, hi everybody =D
needs more dramatic deathstalker sound
/me waves to Patty.
What's the point of mods if there's a room with NO MODS
:>
Star wars?
0What's next guys?
Needed more Rarity laugh
Makes absolutely no sense
Star Wars!
Starwars FTW!
Stare Master
Exactly
Too risky
Stare Master is next
errgh, I even spelled it wrong, man I suck
Suddenly dogs
How be you?
Thousands of them
6Way too risky.
now don't misunderstand me
Too risky
Bad idea
I'm saying "mostly unmoderated" but not "without mods"
I to be good.
No
i would really rather not have an unmoderated room
There's either "all" or "none"
I think this counts as a net gain
6It would be too difficult to moderate that and a regular room.
"unmoderated"*
And another house.
How to be are you? :o
and his wife
He also lived the dream.
=/
Now it's in English.
lets see Photo finish take his house now eh Purple'Prose?
Let's just stick with the regular rooms and a mod room
He also killed off his hero-turned-crazy-old-man
Ratzenburger
Sound plan
10But there's hardly anything to be moderated as it is, and where do you draw the line between 'fine for this room, not fine for the other'
6And the appeals room.
XD
well, we have to consider the possible scenario of the other rooms becoming full
6Derpy can be the vid suggestion room.
and he hit a man in the head with a cane
pony time?
I
That's why we wouldn't allow an "unmoderated room" in the first place
The alternative to the crazy cat lady?
'm good
6It's not hard to do.
That's way too much lee way
How much does it cost to fuel a zepplin?
Twilightfan Yupperz
give her time..
It's an airship
Ciao!
:o
Every room is moderated
nothing if you just let it float there
10>:3
The Empire State Building was originally going to be a Zepplin port before we abandoned the technology, I saw it on Fringe
Every room
It runs on awesome
I'm talking with somebody on Skype, and I'm seeing if it's possible for me to use mIRC on my iPad
and they say violence doesn't solve everything, this movie proves that those people are wrong
It doesn't need to refuel
And no "sorta kinda maybe" mod room
Hmmm. An excellent point.
TwilightFan and also has the most Jewish last name EVER!
All rooms
heh, 'I saw it on fringe'
you can't
it fuels with magic
The ship in futurama is fueled by alien animal excrement. Maybe Muntz used the same principle centuries earlier
Espy, you and I both are way into this show. xD
you can use Colloquy for the iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone though
its magic i aint gotta explain shit
they've made an app for it, though
let me see if it works, just installed
not the developer of mIRC
That makes a frightening amount of sense...
lol
I never saw the fourth indiana jones movie
the last Indie movie sucked because of Shia LeButtz
prodUction
was it okay?
6Four to one.
6I think.
hm
and aliens, Fengor
6...
Who's Shia LeButtz?
Elky, there were aliens.
there is no such thing as an mIRC build for iOS devices
it was decent
No it wasn't
Shia LeBouff
10I'm a no
no nazis?
Shia was the least of that movie's problems
Four to one then
SOVIETS
10:<
then it must suck
I've seen Labrynth
I think it was o - *stabbed* URK!
It wouldn't end well, it would cause a massive split and massive arguing amongst viewers
Elky, Nazis and aliens.
6Even if the other mods all said yes, it would still be majority no.
oh
wtf does a radiation patch stand for O.o
You mean commies and aliens
heheh
6Precisely.
Sovienazis
Possibly alien Nazis but I don't remember.
take me back
IN TIIIIIME
have you seen the prestige?
6...LAWL
I hope he's not upset
But too bad
6Hopefully not.
I don't think I've ever heard this
10he probably lost 3G
he tends to drop in and out when hes on his blackberry
hmmm
and I've seen this movie at least 4 times before this
10NewManiac you wanna go?
Darken: this is why I always stay for the credits in movie theatres, especially with Pixar movies ;)
10Let's rumble >:3
Sign me up for that ;)
It would look unprofessional and we'd look weak
yeah
FO:E chapter 29 made me sad face, poor twilight ;_;
and people would just spend the whole time there
you*
THQ?
10NewManiac :(
Everyone would go there
FUUUUUU
oh yes please
Someone needs to write Up/FiM fic
I really need to man up and start reading FO:E.
WHEN IS THIS OVER
FRENCH VOICES OUT OF NOWHERE
It wouldn't be fair to the other rooms
i mean, if there were a board on ponychan where you could post ANYTHING and not get banned, would you go anywhere else?
The sheer length of it makes me nervous.
>Havent read FO:E yet
Exactly
already did
FO:E?
not even like /oat/
lulwot
well maniac
Well, I'm sure SOME people would
:)
it would be like /b/
But still
I have no problem with unmoderated rooms.
some points
Oh
I missed out on all the manly tears though
dari, no
10film's over
I'm tempted to read. Is it really all that good?
I was thinking of that title
pinkie pie and her balloons
its best fic eva
also which films won?
Stare Master now?
I know :P
My Little Pony tiem.
Rocker, it's awesome.
Because Europe
But still, too much risk
Pony timw?
10>:3
dumb fabric
: O
arrgh, rellek!
Then I'll read it.
demm clicks
And I probably have more IRC experience than most of you. :P
wrong episode?
she looking at us
I want to see that computer wallpaper.
derp
I can't bring myself to hate that phrase
This is Stare Master.
SHes breaking the 4th wall
she sees us
That wouldn't matter in an unmoderated room, would it?
*Feat.
And Rocker, be warned. It's 600 pages long. literally.
Oh neato. xD
8Scootaloo is only good CMC
I'll take my time reading it then.
yes
Every pony is only good pony
6DCD, it's Battlefield Earth and The Godfather
All you need is a spam filter, links filter.
Still, it would look bad on us
6And yet there'd be trolls.
10No newmaniac. no.
Pony Physics
6And it would just be... bad.
1.Scootaloo 2.Applebloom 3.SweetieBelle
Its a Rube Goldberg Machine
You can't mod all rooms 100% of the time.
8elky: eeeeeyup
And there'd be an aweful lot of people favoring it
8dealwithit.jpg
And then Rarity murdered everypony. THE END
Why not, RainbBro?
Yeah, you can, for now
Thumbs up for Cartoon Noises
RainBro*
There's just the one room
Especially if we plan to have chats where people talk all the time.
Balloon!

http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/id-tech-camp-professor-converts-entire.html <-- Heh
13!espeon
I have faith that we'll be able to look after the rooms when S2 starts
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeens
10espylacopa we're still streaming, ask mods if you need to post a link, but technically no links :<
NO
If I HAD to pick, I'd choose Fluttershy and Apple Bloom respectively.
6Especially since we should have a good few more mods by then.
<_>
Sathi
Gotta look at her app
Saying which of any of the ponies is my least favorite is like saying which ice cream flavor I least like.
6We're looking to have AT LEAST two mods beneath each of us.
I'm sorry sis, I didn't think cartoon physics would take hold
Sathi applied
And I have never had ice cream I didn't like.
xD
13What time is it there?
But iPads can be handy
and she is QUALIFIED AS FUCK
*jaw drop*
Rarity has it right, time = money
Agreed, DragonRage.
6AMAZING application.
with weird colors
Six main mods, 12 half ops
I hate that cat
I don't like that ice cream
I want her on the mod team sooooooooo bad
FORESHADOWING!
it's 11:52 PM
>:3
she's in.
u mad
I've said it a million times.
Did you see the cats face?
Trollpal
no, just no
Opal is best hairdresser.
Dat Grin
Dang, that cat is deadly
we need a female mod.
13ohay, you're one hour ahead of me
cats are best pets
We can't just TAKE HER
6LOL
AMEN
agreed
agreed
That damn cat
Suddenly, hair grown back
Chocolate ice cream is pretty strong, yeah.
this mod room is too much of a sausagefest
She has to go through the proper interview, silly :P
stream is lagging me
Yep
were gonna interview her on weds at 5 Eastern anyway
I have two cats. Or rather, two cats have me
6Well, we're doing interviews Wednesday
10What's with all this SHES A GIRL WE NEED HER xD
hehehe
not trained them?
yeah, because I'm in Italy :P
In timezone +1
6Metal_Link at 4 and her at 5
I actually had this one kind of chocolate ice cream that tasted kinda like coffee.
A bell with a bow
Rocker: In Hoity Toity's words
hi
BRILLIANT

And Apple Bloom is adorable in episode 1.
And then had more.
6Also, I CALL HER FOR MY ROOM

Oh Fluttershy you are such a girl.

I'm not much for waifu's - but I relate best with Fluttershy.

Derpyloo
when I proposed the unlimited room, it was for a reason.
owo
you're kidding
Distressedshy is cute as a button.
did you show her EQ daily?
....right?
like
It'd involve either me making an IRC client (which I've done to some extent), or hosting a server and adding modules to it which would be a lot of work.
we can do it when he's actually going to become a mod
lol
Fridge Horror = If the CMC never disobeyed Fluttershy, Twilight would have remained petrified and missing
6It's not hard.
neither am I
And yeah :P I am owo...
Suddenly blackness
Are you kidding too?
should we have an unlimited room, the user would be redirected there in such a case.
maybe I am
Honestly, I didn't really like the Powerpuff Girls.
Fengor, I don't think that would help. That's just one site.
rider has a point
Loved the show, though.
This is why anime always picks kids to pilot robots are capture monsters
and she lv 4
We can just look

Oh Fluttershy

We just can't

dari, if we have all these mechanisms, then why do we have mods?
rainbow pony is best pony, shy pony is best singing pony
ugh, worst pun ever
Come back here you little asshoel
when people find out there isnt a mod on, they go crazy
We might as well not even be here
GET OVER HERE YOU ASSHOLE

STARE
DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
YOU COCKS ARE BEING MONITERED
That's why we're hiring
I learned that song on guitar. Also, the toy I got was the molded 4-pack. Not those shitty looking brushables.
Dominantshy is... okay sorry ma'am, I'll stop.
Theres some good chickens
ALL GLORY TO THE FLUTTERSHY
If mods aren't on, people can be banned when they get back.
^_^
now I'm not saying we won't have cap increases in these cases
It's not right to have a "no hands on" approach
OHSHIT
Fluttershah
fuck you fluttershy
We'd be detached from our own stream
Fluttershy is either a Druid, or she has a Geas
but a cap increase just seems mostly as a temporary solution.
i was allmost caught watching this
Not to mention that we'd want to see the eps as well
yes.
6DCD, as I just said, we could add more rooms and hire more mods.
however!
6i.e. CMC rooms.
i do!
I do
All that brohoofing in there was adorable.

I do
we need a way to make a headcount, ja?
:D
I want more then hugs
Talking to her self
Too quiet!
Look
I want to hug her and pet her mane and tell her it'll be okay
Heheheh :D
no
6Yeah, I'm saying we'd have a questions room.
Fluttershy is the cutest ever
do you guys mind if we do this on skype?
10lmfao fengor
o.o
hug her all you want, then she can't be in the episodes at least
6...why?
Yeah, let's skype
Well said, NewManiac.
we raise cap, redirect people to their desired rooms, WITH A CATCH
6No.
6I can't.
Talking is easier than typing
Well, Sprinks can't
applebloom, did you learned everything from the last time when you enter Everfree Forest?!
i just meant by typing
Because ofSDOFEOUIAHEFOHWEFUAWLEUIHLEF

we ask them to remain in the unlimited room, just not chatting.

SCOOTALOOOOO
Not fair to them
*Sweetie

In sweden we refer to 20xx as "the 20-hundred years"
2001+ - 21st century. It's kinda logical if you think about it

it is, but it's confusing
21st century as 0-99 was the 1st century
most european languages do tha
I like this compilation
this is like half a movie

we don't usually casually talk about years 0-99
13I need to buy some more batteries before Monday
yah...
13My mp3 player's battery died today and I need to replace it :<
but then we just say "year 42"

why didn't they do the Equestria Girls song for an hour? or even Nyan Pony
oh well
I survived over an hour of Nyan Pony once... was... horrific
10welcome back :>
My fondest memory of Yardiovich's stream was watching all of the 1 hour Equestria Girls.
I had a screencap of me watching 1 hour of equestria girls but I deleted it today
wow
Wierd
we called it "The Man Challenge."
guys I'm back
4ANYWAYS
4yeah
I finished it...
10hey y'all
Fun, right?
It was weird
It was also creepy
needs sequels or more length
but weirdd
yep
then no
its still going? xD
Oh I thought you are talking about something else
Bittersweet is a sad-fic starring RD and PP, really long, but awesome
Yeah I was thinking of something else completely
to be an alicorn is sadder
uh... okay
the first chapter parodies the saddest episode of Scrubs perfectly
Three words: circle of Friends.
04Is everyone in a more talkative mood today?
to be an Alicorn IS pretty sad. The Sun Never Sets is depressing
saddest episode of scrubs? I remember something like that...

Just way tooooo many
and get the ten achievements
hm
we leave the map achievement for last
bittersweet?
10harassment and people trying to out-macro, instead of manage to all in harder
when it's time for the map achievement, we go into another server, with actually experienced players
4I'd like to play with people I know >>
or do you have a personal schedule?
4That's fine then
pretty much this
later on
yeah, for the first ten

Elky, massive clopfest.
uh... okay
There was a discussion that somehow got around to talking about RedTube roulette and motherless
last week, I think it was
what's redtube roulette?
gg
You have Elky interested.
oh lord
7._.
hrm
HRM
HMMMM

/me ponders

/me 12balances ot the colours :3
12*out
Anyone care to explain? I'm dying of laughter right now and I don't think I can do it justice
oshit
10At least wait till mods are asleep
4Nothing much, we're just closing the stream
10;)
Well I guess that means I'll hit the sack too. Night ya'll.
Elky, I'm guessing, like Chatroulette with more tits.
Yes, mods need their chloroform, then BMN afterdark can really begin
alrighty, killing floor soon?
I thought chatroulette was exclusively penises?
night payne
Ugh.
Thanks
10night what_payne
10ffff
Bye.
10whatpayne
Bye, Payne.
:)
YOU GOT MAIL
I've seen way, way, way too many masterbators on Tinychat.
Redtube roulette is taking four random numbers (generally from a post on an imageboard)
I'll go when the stream is over
4Same here
plus I want to make sure this motherless discussion doesn't continue while I'm here
And you must watch/clop to it, no matter how horrendous you may find it
oh, okay
precisely
12fff, I lost my coloured layers D:
oh lawdy
4Motherless?
Okay. *closes eyes* 6483. Someone now has to do that. Lord knows I won't.
4Wutttttt
Not it.
Given what's on redtube, it could be
I guess?
WELP
At least there's a girl involved
dat pelvic thrusting
oh. lol
no no no
it's a porn site
4Motherless is a...uh
4Yeah
4Porn sit
4e
let's call it that.
I think why you got mod
now that you mention it... he is oddly endearing
that's more belly thrusting than pelvic...
really?
FFFFFFFFF
I'm guessing a bad, grosstastic porn site ja?
10kalas can't clop, he's watching starcraft matches :P
10 2rax?
If you really want a good dangergame, use stileproject instead of redtube
yeah
4I used to go there
10fffff
4But it's dangerous, viruses plague the site
unscouted

Yes, especially during the Saturday and special showings.
lol. Yeah it was pretty bad. Like I said, my first time seeing it.
whenever chat's slow, us mods tend to be a bit playful with our powers. :D
I'll be sure to look that movie up with netflix.
lol. It must be fun. Hey I have a good idea!
You guys should do like a mod for a day thing XD
Yea-no. :P
On second thought that might be a bad ides
*idea
probably would.
Have you never seen deathstalker 2?
Oh. Don't. Its torture.
Only on BMN was it bearable.
haha, that bad?
I had the others to encourage me.
Couldn't have been worse than Spider's Web.
I wasn't here for that...
oh, yeah, THAT was torture.
lol
It was PAINFUL
Yup
I've never seen it and I don't plan too.
Hey, we have 3!
good idea.
No, he left
:(
aww man.
Its like IRL i guess in a way.
during the movies its hard. There's like 10 things going on at once. And I really like talking to people.
Do you play any instruments?
bbl movie
I used to play the trumpet, but I kinda fell out of it.
I play piano
Awesome. Pianos are good instruments.
Success.
please stay
UGH!
Oh...
11I switched to Mibbit.
Oh ok I see.
Cool :)
11yep
if I have miirc can I just join this room when I want?
Whoops.
oh.
ees fine :)
or just mibbit.
Any irc software can join the server and room that BMN uses.
Thanks.
the server irc.irchighway.net
The room is, of course, #Bronystate
I see now. Thanks.
http://toonamiarsenal.com/
\:D/
any.
and of course pony music
Pony. :D
I don't care much for hip hop as a generalization bu there are a few exceptions.
I hate vountry.
Country music reminds me of my town. Which I hate with a passion.
The music itself isn't that bad, but its just association I guess.
Makes sense.
but in a lot of other genres as well.
None that I know of.
Hope to convert the few IRL friends I have. :D
Really? none?
me too.
I live in an ultra conservative racist stuck up town with a jacked up social heiarchy government.
It makes me mad.
It's past the point of needing to know people to get ahead, at least.
I understand that.
It was a bad feeling bc I thought he would tolerate.
:/
He doesn't treat me the same.
and I thought he was a good friend too.
Yeah, I know of that as well. -_-
u leave??
aww man...
I'm sad now...
