8Spike is me IRL
Twilight is adorkable
I hope S981 (or whatever) doesn't destroy this stream.
4I actually didn't get Skarlet
My Little Pony is so educational.
Cheap?
4Wasn't too concerned about her
sometimes I think they try too hard to make Fluttershy adorable, and it just kinda feels like it's too "rich" so to speak
Spike is every brony IRL
8why did it have to be snakes...?
AS in "character" cheap
4But Kenshi is one of my favorite MK characters
ouch
4So I had to get him
those idiot porcupines do that every year...
lol
SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH-KEY
8NO NOT THE BEES
"Dear Princess Celestia: Today I learned that snakes hibernate."
4I don't know if Skarlet's cheap or not : /
10CAJ I agree. That's why I'm not a flutterfan :P
John Madden?

""Dear Princess Celestia: Today is learned that dash verse is best verse"

EspyLacopa: I'm liking this idea!
Spike's advice always fail
Twilight broke... DA RULES.
You didn't miss much, honestly
6It's... so bad.
8Espy: that scene in Fantasia scared the hell out of me when i was a kid
and messed up an entire day's worth of work.
This is what you get for using magic
Irony...
brozilla: what's that 'ass' you speak of?
Things start going a little wrong, Twilight panics instead of keeping her cool.
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA KATAMARI DAMACY

;_;
You get used to it :/
:(
sad twilight :(
Poor Twilight, I wanna pick her up and snuggle her! ;_;
alavaa
dawwwwwwwww
Way to toss her under the bus, Spike.
More importantly, she used magic poorly.
besides, Twilight only cried because she tried everything and messed up at it.
I feel sooo bad for her
Thhat "Oh," at the end gave me Diabetes.
4TAKE YER FANCY MAGIC AND GO BACK HOME
jerk AJ
Poor Twilight...
she made Twilight cry :(
docter whooves is pissed
10Hipster the entirety of Fantasia scared the living shit out of me
6Realistically you kinda have to stare at the flooding most of the time anyway...
D'awwwww...
Don't use yer fancy magic to mudder the issue!
Spike should stop talking bushes.
it's okay Twilight, you suck at practical stuff, but you're still adorkable
because you wouldn'T be angry if someone ruined all your day's work...
8RainBroDash: I know that feel bro
RainBroDash: The advancing coffin from Fantasia.
To be honest, I'm not even really watching WWU right now
Talking Frozen Bush
Dinosaurs in Fantasia were the shit, though
spike was always a bush fan
/me must have watched Fantasia about 10 times
Stop!
This looks like a job for a manager!

Paying more attention to the chat
aj is totally in the right
BITCHES INTERRUPTING MY NAP

That reminds of the Magic School Bus episode when the kid took his helmet off on Pluto and only got a cold.
and then they hatched a new Spike, and nopony could tell the difference
actually SirSprinkles this is what Faust said about Ditzy Doo "Lauren Faust has acknowledged the fan following of Derpy. She revealed that, in one of then unaired episodes at the time, Winter Wrap Up, there is a mention of an airheaded pegasus called Ditzy Doo whose appearance is never established on-screen, and should Ditzy make an appearance Faust may--

im gonna do black dynamite if i get the b movie and no country for old men if i get the A movie
DAT FRIENDSHIP
0Charging into battle wearing bikinis? Smart, very smart.
And I can't ask for Vampire's Kiss if I get b movie
How did they get so many people to "act" in this movie?
Hes a wizard so he has a magical advantace
10mine are Die Welle for A movie, and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus for B movie
free cupcakes newmaniac
epic fighting with props
0What happened there?
i love the credits page, where they have about 100 names that are too small to read, on top of the entire army of people
6It's bikini mail
kir13, fair trade.
8dari, that better not be a wordfilter :D
6It gives epic AC
0My guess, newmaniac, is that the actors in this movie have no self respect and mightn't ever will.
Look at his swrod giving the guy a hug.
The best Overworld Themes can also serve as battle themes.
So, I'll probably do Who Framed Roger Rabbit? for A movie or What Dreams May Come for A movie
if you pay attention you'll notice this is the same set from the beginning of the film just redressed

Entire sky is babies!
I gets sad Now...
DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
YOU'LL HAVE SO MANY BABIES
entire team is babies!
babies, babies everywhere
Did she died?
4NO babies :(
godfather: strong and graphic violence and some sexual content
BABIES ARE KENYANS
10SHUSH AND ENJOY IT DARI
sterile lol
.....
10>:3
nope
No shes sterile
no baby, CAD Reference?
Maybe
So can she not have babies, or did she miscarry?
you should be condemned toty
I assume the former.
4Why didn't they ever just adopt?
I missed it didn't I?
Either one
Word of God says she miscarried.
It's never mentioned. Just, no babies.
I was just thinking the EXACT SAME THING, Ghosties :D
Well fuck. -.-
That's... a good point, Ghosties.
Maybe the law about that sort of thing was different back then
thats an expenisve whell
Insurance maybe?
Well, Word of God technically said "lost her baby"
it wouldn't be the same thing
battlefield earth: some violence
That is a good point
I assumed that meant miscarriage.
Dang you tree!
4Adopting was different laws for a white couple?
4Seriously?
Does lost her baby=miscarriage?
10suddenly, square chin/
4No offense, honestly
4But I'm just saying
Maybe they didn't want to "replace" her child who died?
Bow ties are cool
I love this chin
Soo cute
Incoming really damn dark turn
oh fu...I just got here
A balloon salesman his entire life? Really?
How much of this did I miss exactly?
CAJ probably has the right idea, but it's still a little odd
It pays good I bet.
:p
Tacowiz: He is an epic balloon salesman.
I gets sad again now
4If their child did die
Now did she died?
Sells balloons to anyone, anytime, anyplace.
4We don't know if she's sterile or just miscarried
Up 2: Carl totally adopts Russel.
link when its up so i can watch it
...
ffffuuuu :(
Ellie was a Jehovah's witness. She refused to get a blood transfusion. Thus, she died.
tears :(
I've got something in my eye... I got something in my other eye...
now its getting depressing....:(
Up 2: Carl dies
10lol tacowiz
I'm not crying
Up 2. he slowly dies in a nursing home

That rock is a troll
But I still need to be there since I'm the admin for the Steam group and all that. Is he staying after the show?
Elky, yeah nut it's good. I bought the season 1 DVD and watched it with my dad. He liked it.

Only Dug can make the word prisoner sound adorable
Nicest, captor, ever
Samuel
BUT ITS A TALKING DOOOOOG!
Yes dog, you can be my pris- er....I mean companion....yes.
Mayhaps you desire SQUIRREL!
lol
8SQUIRREL!
alpha is a good looking dog lol
IZMA! Ugly
More talking dogs!
>mfw worms voice
Alpha voice
It's a small mailman!
is alpha a pinsher?
dat voice
Someone's been sucking on the helium
who send talking dogs to fight?
If that's alpha, what ever happen to beta and omega?
I wouldn't mind putting up a partnership, but I'd still like to know their plans
SQUIRREL
Oh that answers my question
Someone is begging for the cone of shame.
FORESHADOWING
Russel is best small mailman.
Alpha is Fomay the Squirrel?
lol at small mailman
That is a BUILT damn dog
who send little dog to fight me
Alpha is the best part of this movie
omg alpha is toatally foamy
Darf14, beta comes after alpha and omega is much later in the Greek alphabet. The third one would gamma.
$100
epsilon
delta
Small mailman XD
i thought the third one was gamma
Hello
?
BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL
@NewManiac oops I completely forgot about gamma
Rellek, it is. That's what I said.
uh oh..
02Hi Jet~
hi bane
6Well, it's not like it would much matter.
then where'd the omega come from?
I think Doug is Delta
HAI THERE
A ball!
Hi master.
/me is reminded of 2 Stupid Dogs.
oh hi master
Alpha giving commands in that high pitched voice
I think Doug wasn't important enough to get a Greek letter
6I'm sure they'd take suggestions on things if we gave them. *shrug*
the bees!
All Dogs Go To Heaven!
6And it's really just plugging eachother.
Not the BEES!
Hey Ray D:
all over my I's
It's been a while since I've seen Up, but I remember [spolier] having more dogs than there are Greek letters
just the way he was talking XD
all dogs go to heaven!!!!!!!!!
Its dead silent ._.
Movie froze on me for a second.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
>___>
Ouch
0Ouch
Hi master.
U MAD OLD MAN?
02Yeah ._.
6HaveTuba, he doesn't call them all by greek letter though
Tentfail.
<Dug> *trollface*
Ah, right
GPM's
6i.e. Gray leader, gray one, and gray two.
GPM LOL
I don't know the whole Greek alphabet. Most of what I know comes from Snic Adventure.
more blood???
Remember now.
Sonic*
ah no
that was the shadow
In that case, that's fine. I don't know if it's possible to have partnerships through steam, but I'll promote them in stuff in the group
they have 3 people in their group, so its more like we would be absorbing them
lol
in russels face
I hate today, nobody is online D:<
tentapult
Also
I learn it from Sonic Adventure as well, it was fun for its time period
The safest place to be. Under a house suspended in air.
6Yeah, but they may get people down the line.
6Since it'll be a gaming clan, of sorts.
Cue Dorothy
A house suspended by balloons.
held up by ballons
you not my fucking mother!
Ah, Sonic Adventure.
Helium baloons
Balloons that have been stated are losing their lift.
E-102 Gamma is best protagonist.
Again, Cue Dorothy
Psi
lol
...owch
6Which has been on steam much longer.
Sonic Adventure was back when Sonic was awesome.
Too bad they can't get up there and sleep in their house
Well, they never have any kind of events
6We'll re-plug it after the stream.
hope to fly
myterypony hahahaha! :)
6No, they don't.
sonic was awesome for the first 3 games after that crapp
stick a cupcake in my eye
Sonic Colours is awesome though
Stick a cupcake in my eye.
8meanwhile, an amber alert goes out for russell
so is Russell's mom dead?
Yes, it is
Sonic did poorly in the transition to 3D.
Yes, she is
4summerstorm: Well, that's, like, your opinion man
eyup
its a dreamworks movie so of course shes dead
That poor frog.
4Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 were good titles
i think the fact the bottom of the house hasn't fallen out in the absence of a foundation speaks wonders for it's quality of construction
;p
Pixar, not Dreamworks.
...WRONG STUDIOU SUMMERSTORM
Nobody wants to talk today
8lol fengor
I concur with Ghosties
MY GOD
I like the genesis sonic
oops sorry
lmao
0Sonic Colors was awesome.
Ghosties, I love you
And then Sonic '06 came along.
lol summer storm
inb4 Frog
Point!
Ahh the glitch fest of 06
4o.o Bane
Sonic Adventure 2 was good minus the Knuckles/Rogue, and Eggman/Tails segments
guys, sorry I kind of shut up, but was walking
Ghosties you saw The big Lebowski?
Don't forget the bestiality.
allow me to elaborate on them ideas
Sonic Colours redeemed 06
1/3 of Sonic Adventure 2 was good
4Sooooo...DashAttack only liked Sonic
I liked the Eggman/Tails segments.
and Shadow
They reminded me of Gamma. =/
4No, I haven't, Bane
Point!
the first one would obviously be "expansion"
Stealth Pun
get off of his wroof
....oh.
XD
it's just that they were tedious is all
10SA2 was great, gonna put my foot down :P
D:
8DAT GUILT TRIP
Bane, I've seen the Big Lebowski. My science teacher recommended it to me.
woof
for that, we need to get a number of small partners before plugging for the big ones
when, you know, i'd rather be rolling at the speed of sound
*brohoofs RainBroDash*
lol guilt trip
10(back btw, sorry to interrupt dcd)
Izam trip
I wish they would bring back Chao Garden
0The Adventure series was awesome.
Carl doesn't give a damn
"big ones?"
I'm gunning for us to achieve partnership status with the main FiM Steam Group
chao garden?
My god those effing chaos
I have to admit, I admire his dedication
10Ignaesia <3 damn straight. CAJ you know it dude *brohoof*
which has, y'know, 8000 members
that was kinda boring
You mean partners with My Little Pony
Gotcha
RainBro, the music in the Knuckles segments were terrible.
Oh I remember those chao, they were fun to toss and abuse >=)
It least it doesn't have sonic-wolf.
the Knuckles segments were just terrible period
Oh gods, Pumpkin Hill.
Let us not forget "I can sense it in my feet."
10NewManiac but it was COMPLETELY outdone by the shadow music. that was SICK and you know it
4All I know is: Sonic Generations
Chao's are stupid. Everytime I hatched one, it tried to drown itself in the pond.
0Knuckles stage music was hilarious.
testin'
SraKe *claps*
10I CAN SENSE IT IN MY FEET THE GREAT EMERALD'S POWER ALLOWS ME TO FEEL
10I CAN'T SEE A THING BUT IT'S AROUND SOMEWHERE
the only good thing about Knuckles' stages was the music
because it was terrible
10haters hatin yet?
8this is why sonic is awesome: http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110702145402/gyropedia/images/d/d2/Doctum_Face.png
1,2,3, and sonic and knuckles for me
I AM THE FIGHTING FREE KNUCKLES
10lmao hipster calssic
0Rider: It hated you maybe? :P
hahaha
AND I'M AT PUMPKIN HILL
YOU READY>!
PUPPIES!!!
I have 4 words to say about the Shadow game: FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM
4I'm the only person happy about Sonic Generations? What's this world coming too...
dem cheekbones
now for that, our greatest ace beneath the sleeve would be the fact that, y'know, we will stream the S2 eps live
I prefer the first 4 sonic games on genesis, and yes I am including sonic and nuckles
10I AIN'T GONNA LET IT GET TO ME CAJ
i kinda want it Ghosties, but i'm skeptical
I sometime like the 3D one
0Why do some of you have colors?
0Sonic Generations looks great.
Ghosties, I've yet to play it.
but not really
The puppies are not amused
though, i really loved Sonic 4 on XBLA
4I can understand skeptical
10I must stop this lyricspam though
Land of the evil dogs
Theyre mods TwilighFan
TwilightFan because Sonic Colous was surprisingly awesome
4But When I saw Classic Sonic and a remade Green Hill Zone? And the music?
0Ah.
4Amazing
>thinking that sonic went downhill after sonic 06
Oh hi Muntz.
Muntz is what happens when Twilight and Pinkie's child got old and angry
oh you mean text nvm
0Ignaesia: Not what I meant. LOL
DARNDEST THING
8Fengor: it's the Doctum face
The theme to Sonic Heroes is catchy as fuck.
hahaha
10RBD has Fish n Chips *hoping that I get some love from my Brit buddies <3*
I like you temporarily!
0Hmm.....
Dogs.
We came all this way for sugar and you are going to give it to us
hahahaha
*gives love to RBD*
0Yep.

TwilightFan Mods=Colors
<3 Haddock and Chips :D << British brony
Fish n chips are proof that god loves us
0I see......

10AGAIN

Muuuuufffiiiiiiins
06Gnite all :3
I love how different their faces are
Be...our Guest be our Guest.
YOU EAT CHIPS WITH A FORK?
there are some things you can't jsut do in live action
Also, SOnicSATAM was bad-ass.
Sonic puzzle fighter
Yes, Bjorn. Brits are classy that way
but our first objective should be a bit less ambitious: let's try breaking into the Ponychan Pwn Party in Steam
You eat freakin chips with your hands.
Amen NewManiac
Go dirigible go.
I am going to take this chip and EAT IT!
SatAM was epic
10Bjornfot you must live in one of those ridiculous countries. let me show you:
CONE OF SHAME
Cone of shame lol

Darf14: lulz, dramatic potato chip
10Chip forks.
I'm not even going to correct my accidentally capitalizing two letters anymore.
sonic underwater racing
those are sporks dude
I live in Sweden, so yeah RainBroDash, very ridiculous-
Dogs are terrible at pouring wine.
that doesn't look classy at all
DCD, you think like a business man
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog was complete shit, though.
10yes, ridiculous country without wooden chip forks. Every single fish n chip shop has them
It doesn't look classy but it is, if you hold the fork right
I like Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog my good sir
>implying we have fish n chip shops
we have those forks too, just noone uses them
Muntz is such a badass
6BMN is srs bsns
10also, you try to eat everything else with the chip fork; so you eat fish with a chip fork, sausages with a chip fork, whatever you bought with your chips
really? cause they gave me normal plastic forks when I got some fish and chips while in London
epsilon
Muntz is so badass that Celestia decided to just leave him alone in the Everfree.
I do, but nobody listens >.>
what the
10Fengor london is shit
Fengor, that is the HEIGHT of class.
He is more evil with that voive
Starring Doctor Claw as Alpha
super sonic eating challenge
10plastic forks are bleugh
i mean voice....*sigh*
yea britain, you sure are classy
The bathound's voice is back to normal.
DELITE!
10TREAT

Funny, cause I'm a future doctor.

Suddenly dramatic lighting.

Chocolate is delicious.
Pinkie Muntz is full of rage
Reese's puffs is my cereal of choice
So, he was hunting for that bird for over 100 years, and a different old man that wasn't even trying found it in 15 minutes. FAIL!
or is it Muntzy Pie?
sometimes Pixar needs to let off some grimdark after making movies like Wall-E and Cars
10>mfw I just fabricated a chip fork out of a magnum ice cream stick *fucking macgyver in this hizzle*
4Serial killer? IN MY PIXAR?
Rainbrodash hahaha

Carl = Grumpy Old Fluttershy, Russel = Derpy/Ditzy, Ellie = Pinkie Pie, Muntz = Pinkamena.
Ghosties, it's more likely than you think.

0FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Horseapples!
Dammit. Congress passed that streaming bill. :p
No.
Well, I have to say that was a pretty good movie. Awfully depressing the way it ends, though.
And so Carl wait for death inside his house
Executive Producer: This broadcast is offline
did SirSprinkles died?
One of Pixar's saddest movies yet.
but it never came
it must be hard to get a pizza up there.
4That was a pretty damn dark ending if the movie really did end there :(
THE F5, IT DO NOTHING!
They ought to write a sequel sometime.
grr
It's back!
oh no spaces
8YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, SIRSPRINKLES
Press start, guys

It dropped out just before he got the book out, I think.

That would have been the most depressing ending of all time

Rainbrodash I LIKE BATTLEFIELD BETTER
Carl's day clothes are best sneaking suit.

go youtube it. To try and put it in words, the screen is split into vertical bars that are thin in width, and show a part of a portrait/a side of the face/ect.

CANE FIGHTING LIKE A BAWS
boss mode activated!
This is the best old man fight that I have ever seen *eats popcorn*
And thus he hits another person in the head with his cane.
I think I said that last time, too.
Right, and?
10"<RedGyarados>: Old SNake vs. Liquid Ocelot, round 2." <- this.
PUNCH THE SWORD!
and while we will have the "redirect" script dari said we could make
Darf14, I've seen better.

This has been another episode of, Retired badasses

If we're going to give limited-viewer rooms a whirl, we gotta make a way so that viewers can try and access them to their heart's content
if i were him id just kill carl :/

horizontal ladder is best ladder
Pwned
0Rellek: Yup.
/me tranqilizes Ray.

Rellek, every villain's downfall is when they have the good buy at gunpoint and deliver a monolouge.

ooooooohhhhh

Ah, adrenaline.
Barrel Roll Fail!
/me yawns also.
Squirrel!
by the power of greyskull
arent we going to end up with 1 room that only has 3 people in it?
=w=
hey guys lets NOT shoot the baloons and down the house
also AE, SC :3
6We can change the cap mid-stream
10just make it only apply to the first room?
Pixar! Steampunk! NOW!
6So it's not a big deal
He almost killed him. xD
Damn that flying squirrel and his moose buddy.
13I totally did NOT forget
13I was just
10so we have 250 and 253?

10but yeah DCD that sounds cool. depends if they're gonna be streaming the same thing or not
Crazy Old Bastard goes into a rage
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT CARL FOX
Phase 3 begin
Oh hai there gun.
6They would be.
finally a gun
Look out hes packing heat
musafa fall to his death and hes not a villain
QUICKTIME EVENT GO
Bane I have never noticed and it is completely fucking true.
You're good, Carl, but I'm better!
6It's just to keep from constant turbochat.
0Apparently Pixar REALLY wanted to avoid a falling death but felt they had no choice.
10hm
i don't understand how this guy is "evil"... he just wants to prove himself. for science
He's evil because he's a murderer.
Gun's are very rare to appear on a animated film.
Considering the setting of the movie, falling to death really isn't that out of place.
and a lunatic
He tried to send a kid plummeting to the earth
That's why we'd be splitting the channel into different rooms, so a couple mods can be in one room
He has an old guy and a kid at gunpoint.
why are level action and bolt action guns so manly?
/me yawns and takes a nap on Jet's head
he evil because he's trying to kill the protagonists
and chop an old man in half
And keep from horrid turbo chat
now that's why making them themed is a good idea. We will probably not have full rooms, as most people will flock to their favorite pony rooms
You're in my sights! You're going down!
yup
HA
/me flies while Ray is on head.
What the heck?
owo
fuuuuuuuuuu
Curse you balloons@!
How many rooms are we talking?
I... can't... looooooooose!
needed more balloon
8KILLING YOUR CHILDHOOD IDOL LIKE A BOSS
Those Balloons will save him
4Did he died?
0Bye bye bad guy.
6Six? :D
Adventure awaits you... ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET DOWN
we can also react accordingly. For example, we can expect the Rainbow Dash room to hit more traffic.
Don't worry. He was still tied to some balloons.
Remember what he had a daydream about earlier in the movie?
KILL MY IDOL
CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!
LIKE A BOSS
10I just realised Kevin makes the same noise as those little dinosaurs in Jurassic Park
10...
It all comes full circle, Espy.
What a horrible way to go, this is why you always carry a leaf to turn into a racoon.
Furthermore! There is also another vital part of my plan!
NOOOOOO ELLIE!
bye bye house
they're pretty cheerful, considering they just killed a guy
he survives, lands in equestria
Purple'Prose: YEEAAAAAAAAH!
*gasp* :O
6Six mane mods, six mane ponies, six rooms.
GET A SWEET BLIMP! LIKE A BOSS!
Yeeeaaah
Where upon they love and tolerate the shit out of the old crazy guy.
fly into the sun!
OBJECTION!
And thus, Carl kept his promise to deliver the house in a blimp.
like a boss
:V
i like to thin we'll all go to equestria when we die :S
I'm not talking about six rooms to start with...
think*
We will dont worry
6Well, we /could/
10>kill old guy >steal his shit >open the door >get on the floor >everybody walk the dinosaur
...I'm talking about seven.
ROFL
6LOL WUT?
also, i think the plan was 2 main mane mods per room
I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN EQUESTRIA
lol
*Cue Objection!2004.mp3*
lol RainBroDash
mane*
RainBroDash, you win comedy.
Seven?
Thirded
lol
Wut?
And the Great Fox takes off

That cane has a lot of iron on it, that's why they want to eat it

Wow, he's so excited about handing out badges.
Star Fox. We are forever in your debt

awww
zeppelins are fraking impractical
manly tears T__T
and this go's to *yarn*
for being an epic hero...
6Poking our heads in and whatnot.
I present you this Medal of Honor
also
a shitty plastic medal
Waaaaht?
10it makes me sadface splitting mods into seperate rooms
inb4 Woah
"You have saved me from the ninjas, dudes! Want to go get a burger?
this is a minor thing
CALL OF DUTY OLOLOLOLOLOL
"
but
Elky, It's a giant balloon house... in the SKY.
woah
daaaaaaw
10just saiyan, i see it's necessary
A bottle cap, *salutes*
D'awww
Apparantly he never washed up between now and leaving
then just us a normal balloon
we should have a pic of Celestia that links to the mod room
yes. One room with no limits, mostly unmoderated because said conditions would not allow for effective moderation. However, the existence of said conditions would also make it so that moderation isn't so vital.
0SO MUCH DOG
Gray one
you would have to type in a password and such still
Caw caw, RAWR!
and not a fuck was given by his mom that day
red one
BLUE
...Anything Goes Chat Room! Derpy Hooves! *finger point*
I have a feeling Dug will win
Dug is best talking dog.
A room with no limits?
Gray?
No moderation?
a compromise between steering and floating ability doesn't work
You're joking
6The room for if your banned should be LUNA
10an anything goes chat? :S
hmmmm
And lo, they travel the world in the Spirit of Adventure.
Your son is friends with a guy who has a badass airship
Everyone would go there
i dunno about that
Roses are gray, Violets are gray
... T____T
THE END
Screw your Car I have a Blimp, U JELLY?
6That's not a good idea...
10it would be like a /b/ room
Ow. My heart.
that house crushed all his furniture
then they fucked
6It would be SO bad.
My son will never be friends with a guy who has a badass airship.
FRENCH!
consider the following scenario
=/
how?
that seems like it could backfire horribly
10sorry to kinda shoot it down, but bah D:
Everyone would go there, DCD
That's no blimp...
0__o
0I want a dirigible. :(
10Great film :)
this is where they need to show Muntz trudging through the jungle all like 'Next time Gadget, NEXT TIME!!!"
Is this all in french?
roses are gray, violets are gray, im dead and color blind
And an army of talking dogs
Happy ending!
For a moment I was expecting the MLP:FIM ending song at this point.
We wouldn't get any real viewers in the other rooms
6Everypony would go there...
That ending...
Wut?
Hold It!
this movie needs more rape sounds
Me too Espy, me too...
No, sorry
oops I mean Zip-line.
10dari just because there was no suicide
No hold out
especially since by then we would have our own website with a domain name
The two fit so well together.
Espy, same.
God bless you John Lasseter
That's just a bad idea
i agree Elky
copypasta song is boring
novaeu
That's a Zeppelin.
but otherwise, it was good
I mean, hi everybody =D
needs more dramatic deathstalker sound
/me waves to Patty.
What's the point of mods if there's a room with NO MODS
roses are gray, violets are gray, i am dead and so are you *pull out gun*
:>
what if one of the requirements for being in said room...is to be present in another one?
Star wars?
0What's next guys?
Needed more Rarity laugh
Makes absolutely no sense
Star Wars!
so if people were posting CP or something in there, we would be responsible for it
Starwars FTW!
Stare Master
Exactly
Too risky
Hi Jet =D
Stare Master is next
Sorry DCD
errgh, I even spelled it wrong, man I suck
And then they saw Revenge of the Sith. The End
Og god!
Needs more cyanide.
Suddenly dogs
How be you?
Thousands of them
6Way too risky.
now don't misunderstand me
Too risky
Bad idea
Dug scored big time.
I'm saying "mostly unmoderated" but not "without mods"
Hey look, the kid got a new GPS.
I to be good.
No
Carl lost his house, but got a surrogate son, a sweet airship, and an army of doggy minions
i would really rather not have an unmoderated room
There's either "all" or "none"
I think this counts as a net gain
6It would be too difficult to moderate that and a regular room.
"unmoderated"*
And another house.
How to be are you? :o
and his wife
He also lived the dream.
=/
Now it's in English.
lets see Photo finish take his house now eh Purple'Prose?
Let's just stick with the regular rooms and a mod room
He also killed off his hero-turned-crazy-old-man
Ratzenburger
Sound plan
That Zeppelin counts as his new house
10But there's hardly anything to be moderated as it is, and where do you draw the line between 'fine for this room, not fine for the other'
6And the appeals room.
XD
well, we have to consider the possible scenario of the other rooms becoming full
6Derpy can be the vid suggestion room.
and he hit a man in the head with a cane
Crazy dog man?
0Trivia: John Ratzenberger is in EVERY FRIKKIN PIXAR MOVIE! :P
pony time?
I
6We can raise the cap, DCD
That's why we wouldn't allow an "unmoderated room" in the first place
The alternative to the crazy cat lady?
'm good
6It's not hard to do.
That's way too much lee way
How much does it cost to fuel a zepplin?
10DJ P0N-3 for suggestion room pony.
Twilightfan Yupperz
give her time..
It's an airship
Ciao!
:o
Every room is moderated
nothing if you just let it float there
10>:3
The Empire State Building was originally going to be a Zepplin port before we abandoned the technology, I saw it on Fringe
Every room
It runs on awesome
I'm talking with somebody on Skype, and I'm seeing if it's possible for me to use mIRC on my iPad
and they say violence doesn't solve everything, this movie proves that those people are wrong
It doesn't need to refuel
And no "sorta kinda maybe" mod room
Hmmm. An excellent point.
TwilightFan and also has the most Jewish last name EVER!
All rooms
WHat? No.... It has propellers
heh, 'I saw it on fringe'
you can't
its only built for Windows
And eventually the Helium would run out!
Lauren Tofal. . .for a second I thought that said Lauren Faust.
it fuels with magic
The ship in futurama is fueled by alien animal excrement. Maybe Muntz used the same principle centuries earlier
6Sorry DCD, it just... wouldn't work.
Espy, you and I both are way into this show. xD
you can use Colloquy for the iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone though
its magic i aint gotta explain shit
I runs on Dog shit
This was a better Indiana Jones movie than the last Indiana Jones movie
they've made an app for it, though
let me see if it works, just installed
It's three to one, sorry DCD
not the developer of mIRC
SraKe said it far better than I ever could
That makes a frightening amount of sense...
lol
I never saw the fourth indiana jones movie
the last Indie movie sucked because of Shia LeButtz
prodUction
was it okay?
6Four to one.
nope
6I think.
hm
and aliens, Fengor
6...
Who's Shia LeButtz?
Elky, there were aliens.
Don't know where RBD stands
it was decent
No it wasn't
Shia LeBouff
10I'm a no
Again, who?
Anypony seen Labyrynth?
no nazis?
Shia was the least of that movie's problems
i just cant imagine it ending well
Four to one then
SOVIETS
10:<
then it must suck
I've seen Labrynth
I think it was o - *stabbed* URK!
It wouldn't end well, it would cause a massive split and massive arguing amongst viewers
Elky, Nazis and aliens.
6Even if the other mods all said yes, it would still be majority no.
oh
wtf does a radiation patch stand for O.o
it proves that any movie is improved by casting David Bowie as your villain
We don't want OUR stream to become what Ponychan's like now
You mean commies and aliens
heheh
6Precisely.
Sovienazis
Possibly alien Nazis but I don't remember.
0I only wanted to see THIS movie, so see ya.
David Bowie as the villain, Bruce Campbell as the hero?
anything is improved by david bowie
take me back
nazi commies
IN TIIIIIME
Woah what?
and DCD is gone
10Jewish Nazi Zombies?
have you seen the prestige?
What is this Music?
6...LAWL
I hope he's not upset
But too bad
I dunno the title, but I love it
6Hopefully not.
i dont think so
This song is the cherry on top of a great movie
I don't think I've ever heard this
and what about The Rocky Horror Picture Show
Ziggy Stardust vs Ashley Williams
10he probably lost 3G
RainBro, >Jewish Nazis lolwut
he tends to drop in and out when hes on his blackberry
hmmm
Directed by Sam Raimi
Sounds like a song from FallOut
and I've seen this movie at least 4 times before this
10NewManiac you wanna go?
sounds like Fallout / Bioshock music
Darken: this is why I always stay for the credits in movie theatres, especially with Pixar movies ;)
10Let's rumble >:3
Saw bits of the Rocky Horror on Bravo as a kid, was a bit of a mindfuck so I kinda want to see it now that I'm older
Point is, there's just no way we can have a "mostly unmoderated" room. Waaaaaaay too much leniency and it would look bad on the mod staff
I'm sure we'll have a Rocky Horror evening this summer
Yay guess I just came in for the end credits...
Sign me up for that ;)
It would look unprofessional and we'd look weak
yeah
LIFE.
6So, mane six for rooms, Celestia is mod room, Luna is appeals room, Vinyl is suggestions, and Derpy is questions room?
Up the Video game
FO:E chapter 29 made me sad face, poor twilight ;_;
RainBro, no thank ypu.
and people would just spend the whole time there
you*
THQ?
10"<Elky>: I'm sure we'll have a Rocky Horror evening this summer" viewers suggesting viewers' suggestions
either somebody will choose it, or they'll make a special show
Exactly, "unmoderated room" would become the new /oat/
10NewManiac :(
Everyone would go there
FUUUUUU
oh yes please
Someone needs to write Up/FiM fic
I really need to man up and start reading FO:E.
WHEN IS THIS OVER
FRENCH VOICES OUT OF NOWHERE
It wouldn't be fair to the other rooms
thetrollside, DON'T SPOIL IT! I'm only on chapter 4
i mean, if there were a board on ponychan where you could post ANYTHING and not get banned, would you go anywhere else?
The sheer length of it makes me nervous.
>Havent read FO:E yet
Exactly
already did
10apokalipse we still love you
FO:E?
not even like /oat/
lulwot
David Bowie in the Naruto The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show.
well maniac
Well, I'm sure SOME people would
:)
it would be like /b/
it gets sad
But still
I have no problem with unmoderated rooms.
some points
Fallout: Equestria.
Oh
I missed out on all the manly tears though
dari, no
10film's over
okay sorry internet fell
I'm tempted to read. Is it really all that good?
I was thinking of that title
Will that lame ever learn?
10wb DCD :>
pinkie pie and her balloons
its best fic eva
also which films won?
Ghosties: No what? That's just my opinion.
Stare Master now?
I know :P
My Little Pony tiem.
Rocker, it's awesome.
Because Europe
I mean lamp
But still, too much risk
Pony timw?
10>:3
dumb fabric
: O
arrgh, rellek!
Then I'll read it.
demm clicks
And I probably have more IRC experience than most of you. :P
wrong episode?
Gold silk
she looking at us
NEIN ZE LAG ISH HERE
I want to see that computer wallpaper.
Feat/ Cutie Mark Crusaders!
derp
I can't bring myself to hate that phrase
This is Stare Master.
oh god
SHes breaking the 4th wall
she sees us
That wouldn't matter in an unmoderated room, would it?
*Feat.
Awwww sweetiebelle is adorable.
question, why is it that the view of your desktop is so small on the stream?
And Rocker, be warned. It's 600 pages long. literally.
10GIEF TEH PONIES
Oh neato. xD
Sweetie Belle is always adorable.
Sweetie Belle is the best crusader
8Scootaloo is only good CMC
I'll take my time reading it then.
What I'm saying is that in my experience people tend to look after themselves.
what ignas said
yes
Every pony is only good pony
6DCD, it's Battlefield Earth and The Godfather
All you need is a spam filter, links filter.
RIBBON
i hope it gets turned into a book
sweetie belle is the best of the CMC
Hipster, all CMC are best CMC.
Still, it would look bad on us
also hipster, you like anything that remotely looks like dash
6And yet there'd be trolls.
hell
10No newmaniac. no.
Pony Physics
6And it would just be... bad.
1.Scootaloo 2.Applebloom 3.SweetieBelle
Its a Rube Goldberg Machine
You can't mod all rooms 100% of the time.
8elky: eeeeeyup
so I kindly disregard your opinion on the cmc
Hipster_Brony you keep saying that, but I don't think you know what it means.
And there'd be an aweful lot of people favoring it
8dealwithit.jpg
rainbow pony is best pony so duhhh
And then Rarity murdered everypony. THE END
Why not, RainbBro?
Yeah, you can, for now
Thumbs up for Cartoon Noises
RainBro*
There's just the one room
Especially if we plan to have chats where people talk all the time.
Balloon!
The sweet, sweet song
magic with me
10newmaniac scootaloo is only good cmc :>
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/id-tech-camp-professor-converts-entire.html <-- Heh
13!espeon
I can't pick any favorites for this show. Seriously. The Mane 6 are all great in their own way. So are teh CMC.
I have faith that we'll be able to look after the rooms when S2 starts
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
0Of course an overgrown chicken thinks Scootaloo is best CMC
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeens
rainbow dash took a bath with rainbows and cupcakes
10espylacopa we're still streaming, ask mods if you need to post a link, but technically no links :<
That's why we're doing so much hiring as well
NO
If I HAD to pick, I'd choose Fluttershy and Apple Bloom respectively.
6Especially since we should have a good few more mods by then.
<_>
Sathi
RainBro, Scootaloo is awesome but Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are adorable.
Gotta look at her app
Saying which of any of the ponies is my least favorite is like saying which ice cream flavor I least like.
6We're looking to have AT LEAST two mods beneath each of us.
I shoild be sleeping
Rarity has a -job- you silly filly. Stop bothering her
oh yeah, DCD
I'm sorry sis, I didn't think cartoon physics would take hold
WHAT NOW
Sathi applied
Why'd you come back on Lighty?
And I have never had ice cream I didn't like.
xD
13What time is it there?
But iPads can be handy
it's that artificial stuff
and she is QUALIFIED AS FUCK
I hate you FS
*jaw drop*
Rarity has it right, time = money
Agreed, DragonRage.
6AMAZING application.
with weird colors
Six main mods, 12 half ops
I hate that cat
Im not tired yet xD
I don't like that ice cream
okay guys gimme a sec to explain what I'm thinking
I want her on the mod team sooooooooo bad
FORESHADOWING!
it's 11:52 PM
>:3
she's in.
u mad
I've said it a million times.
Did you see the cats face?
Trollpal
no, just no
10Am I the only person who thinks if you eat chocolate icecream with ANY other icecream, it instantly ruins the flavour of that other icecream?
Opal is best hairdresser.
Dat Grin
Dang, that cat is deadly
we need a female mod.
13ohay, you're one hour ahead of me
cats are best pets
We can't just TAKE HER
6LOL
AMEN
agreed
agreed
That damn cat
Suddenly, hair grown back
I just don't like chocolate icecream
And, Rainbro, you have to admit Sweetie sing in this episode awesome.
Chocolate ice cream is pretty strong, yeah.
this mod room is too much of a sausagefest
She has to go through the proper interview, silly :P
stream is lagging me
Yep
were gonna interview her on weds at 5 Eastern anyway
I have two cats. Or rather, two cats have me
6Well, we're doing interviews Wednesday
10What's with all this SHES A GIRL WE NEED HER xD
dunno rainbro, I never eat chocolate ice cream with anything else
hehehe
yeah, because I'm in Italy :P
In timezone +1
I think Sweetie Belle's cutie mark should be a bell. It's a play on her singing talent and her name.
6Metal_Link at 4 and her at 5
10NewManiac oh shit... true.
I actually had this one kind of chocolate ice cream that tasted kinda like coffee.
nope
DCD, how old are you?
10DAMN YOU MAKING ME QUESTION ME
A bell with a bow
obviously. I'm just messing around.
heya zapdos
Rocker: In Hoity Toity's words
hi
BRILLIANT
I thought I didn't like it at the time, but then I finished it anyways.
I think Sweetie Belle's Cutie Mark should be a Slowpoke
19
I love how it takes a second for her to register
And Apple Bloom is adorable in episode 1.
And then had more.
6Also, I CALL HER FOR MY ROOM
YAY!
God damn Sweetie is a ninja... Ninjaing that gold silk
6DIBS
PFFFFFFFFFFFFT
turning 20 in September, should it be any consolation

My Little Pony : KIDS ARE F***ING A*****ES
U MAD RARITY?
relax, bucko
And then Rarity killed Sweetie Belle
Worriedshy is cute as a button.
I'm not sure what Scootaloo's or Apple Bloom's cutie marks would be.
6...I dunno RainBro, depends on who else we get. :D
Lol wow.
10bucko
6trololololol
You guys are so possesive.
10xD
whoa guys
Apple Bloom's is a hammer.
TROLLY BELLE
10dari this is madness
in an alternate cut Rarity rages out and kills everyone
We gotta mark our territory :P
lets decide the teams later
SUPER AWESOME CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS ADVENTURE WHOO
Alright Bronies, thats about it for me, been up all night and I'm off to hopefully catch some z's.
by the time we implement the room system I fully expect us to have more than a single female mod
0Trollie Belle
10hipster we're having some fun
Night everyone
/me waves.
Yeah, we'll decide all that later
6I was just joking for the most part. XD
Scootaloo's cutie mark is a picture of RD
:>
Sweet dreams Renegade
Applebloom=2x4
Scootaloo's cutie mark should be a doormat
rofl
Rarity's taking this surprisingly well...
Ciao, Renegade.
sleep well Renegadebrony
0Night Renegade
And yeah, we were just joking hip
10thetrollside flaunt it
Well
later renegade
Night Renegade

Tired enough now
CMC are small creatures.
Again
Gnite then :3
brb
10night dude
lol
By Lighty :3
My family knows I like ponies but it's not that they think it's girly. They think bronies don't exist.
yay!
anyways you guys
goodnight, lu! =D
For angels there horns are really showing
I love Fluttershy. xD
Hah
But they do think it's girly.
6So, interviews Wednesday, trial-by-fire on Friday for Soarin and possibly them?
0Hear that? CMC are not Ponies, they're small creatures.
back to business
Show them us, NeManiac.
NewManiac*
Fluttershy is mai waifu
dari, I need to know if there's any way to conceal a channel's name
Oh Fluttershy you are such a girl.
Patty
I'VE TRIED!
Wanna pm? :O
Futtershy monologue is so cute
I'm not much for waifu's - but I relate best with Fluttershy.
Jetty
sure
The Everfree Forest, scary because physics apply there
6Not on fail mibbit
From who, the person who's on it?
rainbow pony is best pony, everypony knows that 8D
Sure Twilight, I believe you, for now
~yay~
They call me Jedi
But sure
i told soarin we would consider him for the next round of mod hirings
:>
My family must never know about ponies <.<
and not rape them
fluttershy = butters of south park
Jedi mastah!
6I know Hipster
Halos
10when you do a whois you can see the names of all the channels they're in
from the common user, yes.
10D:
They will at some point, Apokalipse
http://i.imgur.com/lHZDe.jpg
IDK how to start xD
Ponies are taking over the world
sonic rainboom irl
Are those tickets?
and then, Angel killed the annoyances
what im saying though is that we arent doing a trial run for him
CHAOS!
here's why:
inb4 accidentaly perspective
Not a hind of ponies here yet
6Why not?
hint*
Sweetie, how'd you do that?
I've been meaning to sit my family down and show them Party Of One.
Derpyloo
when I proposed the unlimited room, it was for a reason.
I am your father
I told my Mom and she didn't believe me
owo
you're kidding
I guess you Fluttershy lovers love Bubbles best too.
Distressedshy is cute as a button.
did you show her EQ daily?
....right?
what if all other rooms are filled?
like
It'd involve either me making an IRC client (which I've done to some extent), or hosting a server and adding modules to it which would be a lot of work.
we can do it when he's actually going to become a mod
/me is not a Star Wars fan.
lol
it will be better
Fridge Horror = If the CMC never disobeyed Fluttershy, Twilight would have remained petrified and missing
We can just raise the cap, DCD
6DCD, we can raise the caps.
6It's not hard.
When Blossom is infinitely better
neither am I
YAY
And yeah :P I am owo...
0Oh God, Rider is right.
Like most children, the CMC have no sense of danger
Suddenly blackness
Are you kidding too?
should we have an unlimited room, the user would be redirected there in such a case.
maybe I am
Honestly, I didn't really like the Powerpuff Girls.
Fengor, I don't think that would help. That's just one site.
rider has a point
slow sweetie
Loved the show, though.
With their voices combined the create wind
but the question is, are YOU kidding?
SPOILER: Twilight was a Stone
This is why anime always picks kids to pilot robots are capture monsters
how will we know that we NEED to raise the cap, though?
then show her the know your meme entry
and she lv 4
We can just look
DCD, are you really expecting 1500+ people?
10DragonRage THIS IS MADNESS
Oh Fluttershy
6Redirect them to the questions room I was proposing.
inb4
o.o
we need some sort of measurement, ja?
I like the show, and blossom is kinda likable too
I wanna be the very best, like nopony ever was
Hammer

For real :O?
tlc
later
DAMMIT! This is always how IKEA turns out for me!
you're not using power tolls, are you?
events like the Fighting is Magic tournament. Somewhat plausible.
Look, DCD, we just can't have an unmoderated room
We just can't
Just noticed how my family will find out about ponies!
Apple Bloom looks so funny there.
Hammer sounds like saws?
tools
EEEEEEEEEEE
This part always makes me daww
OH NO
Let's use the Derpy room for overflow
MC Hammer Pony wants one
That would look bad on us, the guys that run the stream
I LOSE!
i lost the game!
I LOSE
inb4 squeek
World Championshy is cute as a button.
6Yeah, Derpy the question room.
Squee
And most people enjoy that we're good at our jobs
I love the squeak noise Fluttershy makes sometimes
SO ADORABLE
awwwww haha
SPIT OR SWALLOW WOMAN, SPIT OR SWALLOW
dammit
i love that squee sound
let me state correctly what I'nm trying to say, though.
NO
NO
we can assign mods there if we have people
he, you'Re all worse than me!
inb4 NO
wait...
They all lost the game
Such a cuddly pony
BO!
yes
NO!
You said "mostly unmoderated"
Snuggly wuggly?
NEIN
forget the unmodderated stuff
it will have mods
That just can't work
ok
Dark
Cutie mark crusader chilean coal miners!
I actually ordered some pony toys online. So I'm sure my family will be happy to see that on Facebook.
Yes and capes
this episode needs more Sweetie Derelle
Yay!
My bed won't be snuggly wuggly for a few more months. =/
DCD, you said mostly unmoderated, now you're not
I think Fluttershy sold MLP to me, she is the most adorable thing ever
Aww.
IKR. Have they made an official Fluttershy plushie yet? Or is it just Twilight and Pinkie?
What are you getting at?
inb4 Hush Now Quiet Now
8NewManiac: i am jelly
dude, coal miners have a tough live
inb4 epic fluttershy singing
10inb4 EPIC
AWW YEAH
forget what I said earlier, except for the "unlimited" part
<3
10whelp, wrong chat
maybe their special talent is dreaming?
<3
People don't just go crazy because there aren't mods on.
10>.<

I am aquiring diabetes
All I can think of is the PPG in bed
Sweetie rocks the flank off of Fluttershy.
GOSPEL MODE ACTIVE!
10SO EPIC
I told you Sweetie Belle was gonna be a singer.
nope
also, induring eppic fluttershy interruption
8i liked Fluttershy's version more
Hipster_Brony, ponyorders.wordpress.com
Sweetie Bell is so black
now consider this.
Panickshy is cute as a button.
6Dari, it's trolls I worry about.
I liked Flutter's better too. xD
TOOT TOOT
10Hipster just go die kthxbai
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
seeeeeeeeeeeensaaaaaaaaasiooooooooooonaaaaaaaaaal AUCH!
And all you need is one person to get spam going
0You woke the Scootaloos
I prefer Sweetie Belle's
So yeah, mods are needed
Filter kicks people who spam.
ELIZABEAK!
dari, have you been on ponychan?
sweetie blacklle
YEAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Links can be disabled.
dari, if we have all these mechanisms, then why do we have mods?
rainbow pony is best pony, shy pony is best singing pony
ugh, worst pun ever
Come back here you little asshoel
when people find out there isnt a mod on, they go crazy
We might as well not even be here
we could raise the caps for the rooms, yes, but what happens if it's raised far more than what our mod squads can handle?
GET OVER HERE ASS HOLE
GET OVER HERE YOU ASSHOLE
where your wing!
dat stare
STARE
pink pony is much better singing pony
I! FLUTTERSHY OF EQUESTRIA, COMMAND YOU TO GET BACK IN THE DAMN CHICKEN COOP!
DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
DCD, that's why we plan on having new mods
Ghosties: To ban people, and decide if what people say breaks the rules.
YOU COCKS ARE BEING MONITERED
6We hire more mods and make more rooms, DCD?
That's why we're hiring
I learned that song on guitar. Also, the toy I got was the molded 4-pack. Not those shitty looking brushables.
Dominantshy is... okay sorry ma'am, I'll stop.
Theres some good chickens
ALL GLORY TO THE FLUTTERSHY
If mods aren't on, people can be banned when they get back.
^_^
now I'm not saying we won't have cap increases in these cases
It's not right to have a "no hands on" approach
OHSHIT
Fluttershah
fuck you fluttershy
We'd be detached from our own stream
FLUTTERS FOR THE FLUTTER GOD
Fluttershy is either a Druid, or she has a Geas
but a cap increase just seems mostly as a temporary solution.
i was allmost caught watching this
10I don't get it. If we expect people to be good in the unmoderated chat, why have it?
Not to mention that we'd want to see the eps as well
charmin, the door is to your left.
what charmin said
yes.
6DCD, as I just said, we could add more rooms and hire more mods.
that's what I'm getting hat
however!
6i.e. CMC rooms.
anypony else just want to hug Fluttershy?
i do!
I do
All that brohoofing in there was adorable.
me
I do
we need a way to make a headcount, ja?
At least one, Ignaesia
:D
I want more then hugs
Talking to her self
Too quiet!
Look
I met a guy at school who said when he watch MLP episodes he keeps porn open in a browser window so he can switch that if anyone walks in on him.
I want to hug her and pet her mane and tell her it'll be okay
Heheheh :D
no
6Yeah, I'm saying we'd have a questions room.
thetrollside, accept it. If people leave hate you for it, they were never your real friends.
Fluttershy is the cutest ever
do you guys mind if we do this on skype?
10lmfao fengor
o.o
hug her all you want, then she can't be in the episodes at least
6...why?
Yeah, let's skype
makes it easier to keep an eye on the main room
Well said, NewManiac.
we raise cap, redirect people to their desired rooms, WITH A CATCH
6No.
6I can't.
Door's to your left, Elky
Talking is easier than typing
Fengor Yah I read that a a comment on youtube...
Well, Sprinks can't
applebloom, did you learned everything from the last time when you enter Everfree Forest?!
10I've had a solid eye on the main room all the way through this
nope, it's to my right
i just meant by typing
Because ofSDOFEOUIAHEFOHWEFUAWLEUIHLEF
10euromod be handling it
to my left is the window
though, i think i wanna brohoof out of Rainbow Dash more
6...just by typing is fine.
we ask them to remain in the unlimited room, just not chatting.
inb4 scootaloo
She learned that adults are silly and that nothing bad can happen to fillies who enter the forest.
in b4 SCOOTALOO
minus the out
just the mibbit tab open.
02Yep ._.
6DCD, QUESTIONS ROOM
So what you want is to silence the unlimited room?
She did learn something, but Scoot and Sweeite are bad influences
SCOOTALOOOOO
Not fair to them
*Sweetie
10in after ignaesia ruins the fun
sorry....did I went too far?
who else wants a brohoof from rainbow dash then >_>
Scootaloo ScootScootaloo!
10SHUUNNN
SCOOTALOO! SCOOT-SCOOTALOO!
SCOOT SCOOTALOO
Scootalooo!
6We could set up a counter for how many people are redirected there.
y U!
so we can see the user numbers and react accordingly.
basically a room that allows us to do headcounts.
ARGUING
rainbrodash :(
Scootaloos everywhere
Applebloom is epic troll
The trees are alive!
8inb4 4chan
foxnews
If Fluttershy is so scared of the everfree forest, why does she live so close to it?
apparently just me thetrollside
Eee
eeep
but
Because she needs to be on hand
er, hoof
rainbow pony is best pony
;_;
in case something bad happens
6If the room was on mute constantly, I'd be okay with it... and raising caps immediately.
Dun dun dun
4Osha-Hello
CAJ: Maybe she's scared BECAUSE she lives so close
As I was gonna say, we can't gauge for anything really until Season 2 starts and we see how many viewers we get
creepy time
But the rent on her cottage is so good, she can't just move
hipser isn't paying attention, or he'd agree
0Twi got pretty stoned
she dead
I want a life sized Twilight statue
if we have, say, 300 people in the unlimited room, we KNOW we have to make another room, and so on.
She lives close to it for the critters
Twilight looks *sunglasses* stoned. YEAAAAAH!
I just don't think it's fair to completely mute an entire room
Dear Princess Celestia. Today I saw a cock and got totally stoned.
6FOX NEWS
Oh no! She been stoned!
Don't move!
duh
10Faux News*
Lati-o hi
:D
What's weird is that fox news actually covered bronies the most positively.
Likewise, I like the six mane rooms

Everyone shut up
10LOL ELKY NO
that is

Cocka what now?
My Little Pony: BETTER THAN TERRORISM
If you believe Fox News I will call child services on you brain!

10Did you not see that RIDICULOUS program covering bronies elky?!
teehee
6The mute is just to prevent problems.

additionally, by using a system like this, we can make it so that mod squads have a lesser load.
Why mute a room?
10No links dude
10:<
see what I'm getting at?
A cock. It's a terrifying creature with the body of a snake
What's the point
"A cock a what now?"
Sorry
hipster isnt a true fan of rainbow
ghosties
Dear Princess Celestia, I just got stoned by a monster cock
>:(
Elky, the fuck are you talking about? They called us equal to men that dress as babies and stay home.
its so we get a headcount on how much overflow we have
If you stare at it too long it will blind you
3 chickens
Seriously, the cockatrice really is one of the silliest mythological creatures.
then they get redirected
4how are yuu?~
It doesn't need to be our main room though
I just want a way to supervise the amount of viewers we have so we can do the necessary preparations
better then zombie ponies
6It would just be an overflow room dude.
NOOOOOOO ELIZABEAK!
The only reason it has half a dozen "turn you to stone" powers is because nobody could take it seriously if it didn't.
That cock is *sunglasses* hard YEAAAAAH!
10dragonrage: >silly, mythological
I'm fine
Good thing Link never encountered a chicken like that

That's another thing, depending upon the amount of people we'd have in a room like that, I don't see how it'd be possible to direct certain people to certain rooms without people filing our improperly

Or are you?

anyone notice it?
Lies.
If we had the six main rooms, Questions room, Requests room, Mod room, that makes sense. What I'm trying to wrap my head around is that DCD suggested silencing the room, and now he's not
Ok guys
hot damn
10NewManiac thanks for telling me I'm an idiot after I announce it in full caps :3
13Of course
I think the only plausible way to sort this out is set up a server.

For the pairing itself, probably Twilershy/Fluttertwi. For the name, Flutterpie
This is why we need to have skype sessions
Dear Princess Celestia. Today I got totally stoned, and learned to avoid cocks thanks to my dear friend Fluttershy. PS could you ask Luna if she wants to go out with me?

4I just now realized that the alligator and the watch are most likely a reference to Captain Hook
That's kind of the show's "thing"
DERP

10I thought that's what you were implying originalls...
10originally
3does anyone know of an anime i could watch?

Highschool of the dead is awesome

In sweden we refer to 20xx as "the 20-hundred years"
2001+ - 21st century. It's kinda logical if you think about it
katapony damacy
oh, didn't know that
it is, but it's confusing
21st century as 0-99 was the 1st century
most european languages do tha
I like this compilation
gah, my internet went blah
Bjorn, what about 0xxx-0099?
they do? german doesn't
Aww, Jet left D=
this is like half a movie
6It's sad because this is longer than a pony ep...
we don't usually casually talk about years 0-99
13I need to buy some more batteries before Monday
yah...
13My mp3 player's battery died today and I need to replace it :<
what kind?
but then we just say "year 42"
13AAA
Are you guys accepting video requests?
yay
bane: only if you ask in caps
lol
or "around 100"
that's interesting, never heard of an MP3 player using AAAs
13it's depressing when I'm listening to a song I really like and it suddenly cuts off and dies |D
6I hate batteries, they always die at inopportune times
dat horse
10xD
Lulz
6my mp3 uses AAA

SilverMane, no. This song is by RainbowCrash88 and was featured in Dash Away.
13.w. Tomoya's English voice, I'm not too keen on it
I know but why?
lol beer
13Don't get me started on Sunohara, he sounds like he hasn't reached puberty yet

polar: what do you mean?
My little street fighter

What am I looking at?!
Actually, this isn't so bad, if you really wanna troll, put on Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure
um whats this?
That shit is unwatchable.
I love this song
Fun fact: Lauren Faust originally wanted to feature Seaponies in FiM, but couldn't due to time and budget constrains.
IT'S APPLEJACK
Leaked footage from season 2
8that old AJ is a horrorshow
10bjornfot take that heresy somewhere else
it's better than half the songs in FiM
lol Ignaesia
8elky: nope.avi
old AJ's voice is great
@SilverMane nope.avi
but if Lauren Faust did sea ponies they would be AWESOME
^
It was GREAT
so cute
fuck Hippocampuses
Dat acting!
IT WAS GREA!
8SHOOBIE DOO
10IT WAS GRATE
SHOOBIE DOO SHOO SHOOBIE DOO
Ever notice how AJ humanisations often look like Megan in the hair and clothes department?
10BUT WHO WAS GRATE?
They'd probably be some sinister fusion of ponies and Naga
Creepy
BUT WHO WAS PHONE
Turns out, it's Dash Off. Not Dash Away.
BUFFER!
ah, ty

/me runs
Same difference
also inb4 no links
6...*twitch*
Oh. Didn't realize sorry:(
10brb
Just to warn you its considered as a art game so don't expect any type of quick button presses
i did play that game... it was terrible...
...what a shame this was made pre-Best Night ever
eh, the game is short anyway
terrible?
well, not very fun
Story of the Blanks was great
you haven't played luna's game, have you?
Oh Celestia. I broke SirSprinkles.
I've tried playing that game, but the zombies are fucking impossible. Maybe it's my slow computer, or maybe I'll just watch a playthrough
i've had this song stuck in my head at work so often lately
mostly the DBZ Abridged version
I also recommend a cool game called "Luna Game."
It has 2 sequels.
/me 6is surprised nopony has said anything about the Desktop Ponies yet...
NewManiac confirmed for troll
trollhoof maniac
/me is about to kill NewManiac for paraspriting
8cuz we cant see them sprinkles
...For 15 minutes
6WUT?
but two sequels?
6That's AWESOME
Bjorn, I'm sorry.
never saw any
/me glares evilly at SirSprinkles the liar
what desktop ponies?
i don't see any
maniac, what sequels?
2so far
there are 3 Luna games.
/me 6watches Apple Bloom spin on the screen
aww yeah
Elky, Luna Game has two sequels.
2i am a zombie is confusing me
Have we watched Hercules yet?
2i thikn my brain has fried
not counting the two different pictures?
2i'll need a new one
nope
not yet bjorn
2*think
6No Herc yet
damnit
huh, gotta look for them sometime
i really need to win the lottery, then
That would be cool
Elky, what do you mean by two different pictures?
Do My Little Derpy - Episode 1
And why would you look for Luna Game?
Elky, if you want to play Luna Game, search it on EQ Daily
8finally, a video with some Dash
in the original game you had one pic of Pinkie and one of Applebloom
the link takes you to a site that has all 3
8SilverMane: TROLOLOLOLO
Dont
just gonna look for playthroughs
I don't trust you
I don't want it messing with my folders
yeah, don't play that game. It's like the treat we don't speak of, but in a game
heh
poor Rainbow Dash...
I watched the first one, but not the others
that applebloom image is still scary
I've yet to play them. I've only watched video of the first and read the synopsis' on Equestria Gaming.
What time is it in the UK now?
the third is the most messed up
0:33
2can't decide where to go?
just watch the videos, it's safer for your computer that way
2ohlookit'sSkylands
eeeyup
What?
10His connection is bad
10Hi Chao
>implying it could harm your computer
/me 2throws a cookie at Skylands
cool.
all 3 have play-throughs
/me doesn't eat it
2wait
well, it doesn't do harm
/me eats it for her
per se
but it is annoying
Luna game doesn't do anything except create a bunch of files.
8for those who dont know, the luna game crashes your computer, so dont actually play it
2but to change names, don't yuu have to type it manually???
omnomnom, cookies
That are annoying to remove.
but it makes files and doesn't let you quit
10It's a bouncer, Chao
2the cookie wasn't for eating
lol no hipster_brony it doesn't
stuff like that
I'm used to listening to the dub of CLannad, souyea
2it was to hit yuu on the forehead
What was it for?
/me 2flees
It can harm the computer, does it affect the hardware or the software?
8it crashed mine
well, it missed, and I ate it
so too bad, you're out a cookie :P
It didn't on linux :)
Hipster, no it doesn't. It just makes a bunch of files. No harm done.
Hipster_Brony don't seem to know how to computar
maybe your computer can't handle luna?
2then yuu'll asploud in a few seconds
LUNEY LUNA
His computer got scared.
2*asplode
I better run the game on deep freeze if I decide to play it
http://myfacewhen.com/i/451.jpg
/me burps out fire
hey, whoever is running the stream, can we watch the Hero pmv, starring Fluttershy and RD?
10Oh, everypony who has been added by TehDavies on steam, that's me
Just read about it on EQ daily.
eh, it's easier to just watch the playthroughs
8well, i guess it technically didnt crash it, but i couldnt exit out of the game
8so i had to restart my computer
10I added all the people i could fine
it's not like there's actual gameplay
10find
yeah.
Hipster, it does that. You have to use task manager.
so its not worth the time
As I said Hipster_Brony, you don't seem to know how to computar if you couldn't even manage to close a simple program. http://myfacewhen.com/i/451.jpg
*bobs head*
ctrl alt delete brah
6We're not hard to find, we're all set to admin on the Brony Movie Night steam group...
DAT BALL
in windows language
as I said, the videos might be fun for you darf
10(sprinks and hipster didnt accept me though)
10HINT HINT NUDGE ACCEPT ME
fabulous dahlin
I hope I haven't just made a reputation for myself as a parasprite. I will let you I am not.
6I'm not on steam currently.
let you know*
Trolling is a art
ok, so what are are we watching this friday?
10I did this yesterday :3
sure, newmaniac, sure...
>implying we haven't already judged you silently
6Since I can't play from this wifi anyway...
6I know.
10fair
10:<
>implying it was silent
6:D
/me is considering going to sleep due to boredom and slight tiredness
>well, if I said out loud what I think of maniac's trolling...
8ctrl alt delete didnt work
6Paraspriting is an art form.
what IS lovs
8as in, it didnt open
*trollface*
*LOUD JUDGING*
8the task manager
...
love is never saying you're sorry. unless you are the man, then it's apologizing at the end of every argument.
RBD, im barely on Steam
then force it open, duh
i never use it
*still head bobbing*
13and Chao, I have NO IDEA how Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka is confusing to you :B It's pretty straight forward
Ok im playing Story of the Blanks how do I do that block pushing puzzle?
Hammerbob
I can judge myself too!
Andy, you paraspriting bastard!
paraspriting is a art
i dunno, there are good trolls and there are bad trolls, and if they're bad I wouldn't call it art
I like to hold the power button on my computer. It's like I'm suffocating it to death
13even easier to understand considering I already told you the base storyline xD
hmm.....try reseting the computer, its may be a little drastic but it might kill the program
2hmm
Ignaesia, push the top 2 blocks all the way, then push the first of the bottom two out of the way
Love is:
2well don't forget
and if you're really good at it anything could be called art
10BronyTj good question. The movies next week are: A Movie: The Godfather, B Movie: Battlefield Earth (lol), Ponies: Green isn't your colour, and Over A Barrel I believe
2i've only seen one episode :P
2i'm sure it'll straighten out later
http://myfacewhen.com/i/451.jpg
2anywayz
battlefield earth.. is sooo not my movie...
dat head-bobbing
2yuu should Highschool of the Dead
10>Bronytj don't '...' me, I was thinking :<
I've never seen it.
6Yeah, we'll set up the home page for the new lineup shortly.

Everypony, what is the worst movie you've ever seen?
10>:3
But year, nice choices
*yeah
13ahaha~
ehh...sorry that I suggested that movie, no hard feelings ...right?
calling it now: we'll never have a b-movie as awesome as deathstalker II
13I have a long list of anime to watch already
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: the Movie
Worst movie was Manos: Hands of Fate
lol
^
80's Cheerilee is evidence that the ponies don't follow Earth's pony age rate

10Remembered that from the intro
8Sprinkles is trolling hard today
10classic
13Because at the moment, I've heard of it and I have no interest in watching it :P
i forgot about that thing
10Oh sprinks
silvermane: implying she said it was the 80's
DAM SCREAMER!
Spider's Web was fun, but not a great as this week's
Sprinkles
I fell for the screamer btw

The noises! Make them stop!
Bjornfot: Are we about to argue about fictional things?
UUUUHUUUHU

SilverMane, but Ge didn't exist. It never happened! EVER! *crazy laugh*

Silvermane do I need the crank for anything?
lolwtf

13but when I found out that he's not the flesh-eating, rotting kind of zombie and that it's actually a comedy, I instantly loved it
/me can see the 3D perfectly with his glasses on
HaveTuba, I read a fanfiction just like that.
#BronyStateVidRequests

10>Let's go clubbing
baby seal

10This video wins
not as good as the real drunk cooking though
13It's an anime where it eventually gets to the point where you consider a male zombie in a magical girl outfit to be perfectly normal to you |D
oh wait, cross dressing, magical transforming zombie
NOOOOOOOOOO!
6>implying I'm doing requests, btw
AWESOME
lol Jack in the watercooler
ya
I am a member of a school group that is against the killing of seals. We made it into a club. We are no longer allowed to meet though, something about people disliking our motto. What's wrong with our name? Club Seals is genius name!
that anime was pretty funny
ok shit started getting scary
10oh u

SilverMane, just like how I went around telling people I like Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Apple Bloom! What's wrong with supporting the crusades?
13AH yeah, I recognise that name

KAWAII
2i think i will like this anime
awww
But I'm partial to sad fics, so.
I would swear i've seen accepting requests....
my point still stands maniac
13Yeah, don't mention anything else Chao :3
You'd probably like the one I mentioned then XD
ohwell my bad then
Today, tomorrow, forever
Anypony read the Ballad of Twilight Sparkle?
Ithink crossovers are the best
is pretty sad.
Ok Story of the Blanks was really cool but scary as fuck
LUXURY HOME BUILDERS
what was it about maniac?
Ad!
Cutie Mark Crusader Luxury Home Builders
10dat ZZ Top
aww
my favorite ones are Bittersweet and the Out in the Cold universe
Ad went away
13When you finish the anime, let me know what you think of it~
6No it didn't.
Elky, Twilight goes to Manehattan to resolve legal problems with Trixie but it turns into musch more.
awww
10it's faint
much*
poor pinkie will ruin her neck
it didn't
Lyrical Musings is hilarious, especially after reading Out in the Cold
go away
durr hurr
Ballad of Twilight Sparkle is epic
so many crossreferences
maniac, was it the one where twi gives trixie a new cart?
looks like Pinkie Pie is filling in for DJ-PON3
Pinky's just having a spasm
It's time for me to go. Bye bronies <3
Twilight Skies over Canterlot did that, Elky
Elky Thats Twilight skies over Canterlot and its awesome
dammit
6When DJ P1NK-3's head starts a'twitchin' the beats are about to get bitchin'
Goodbye friend
10 99 red balloons? O_O

Ignaesia knows what is good!
I recommend Black and White to everypony.

silvermane *brohoofed
I'm reading Black and White right now, Newmaniac
brohoof back
there was one really good trixie/snails fic too
no shipping ofc
Also, the Vinyl Scratch Tapes are pretty awesome.
I just finished that Story of the Flanks game btw, it scared the bejeesus outta me
I liked Feathers of steel, Heart of GOld alot
It's not where you go...
don't you want more after playing that though?
7Okay, well, I'm just drabbling about chat...
OH. I totally forgot Junior Speedsters Forever :D
really ignys xD
I wanna know what the story was about ues
10NewManiac is so right. Vinyl Scratch Tapes. VinylxOctavia is one of those shipping pairings that just makes me all giddy and junk
Unforeseen Turbulence is an epic shipper that introduced me to the term 'Wing Boner'
yes
hehe
and it is really short
nut I though dj octy was the canon name!
ummm
my cats sit like that all the time
8HOLY SHIT THAT LOOKS LIKE MY CAT
oh crud, a legless cat, it must me No Legs the cat
10it is, hipster
8EXACTLY like my cat
6My cat does that all the time. XD
RainBro, it isn't really shipping so far. Except for Vinyl talking about their "date
wtf, did you guys here Winter Wrap Up in the background?
"
10I broke into your house, stole your cat and filmed that
yay catlovers <3
my cat is lighter

10oh yeah newmaniac, but that's why I love any fanfic that involves the two of them
10>:3
brb
10shipping or not
I aaaaaaaw'd at the I'm in hell part
the ponies were such dicks in Over a Barrel, not one gave Pinkie support after her song
now I imagine rainbro as a sneaky ninja cat thief
it kinda works
10elky you better believe it.
YEAAAH
Floof
would you support pinkie in a hooker outfit?
err
and mcgyver too

Progress was awesome until she left canterlot. It was mediocre after that.
I hope they bring back the two OC ponies from Canterlot

Seriously, that city uses a LOT of power
sounds like star trek movie trailer or something
This was my first pony video before I watched the series and became Brony.
it'sstar craft 2
the trailer, but with ponies
It is Pony Craft 2, I hate dealing with the Parasprite rush
one day, someone is going to make an action movie completely out of the ponies, and it will be the most epic thing EVER
ahh right that makes never, never played that
my first PMV was Pony Polka, with Weird Al
*makes sense
13Well
13it's 1am
06the question is, how does floof become power
damn im tired I think

my first pmv was night of pony
06me and you both xP
and still my fav

Perhaps you should get your floof to bed...
13so I'm gonna go to sleep now xD

06And then I'll do the same
*huggles AE goodnight* :3

06Before I end up not being able to leave
06:U¨
Some people say the world is wonderful, and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part.

ZOIDBERG

U SUCK
"you suck!" lol
10so sprinkles
2goodnight
10what you up to for the rest of the night?
2thnaks for the new anime
So, RainBro, did you find and DJ Octy fic?
2i'm starting to get it
but why is AJ the mac?
2*thanks
wouldn't it make more sense the other way round?
Apple
oh
Why don't they use Big Mac?
yes
still
Big Mac has little screen time
Mac's don't get viruses....OBJECTION!!!
6Heck. If. I. Know.
PC = running the large hadron collider. Next.
10NewManiac I'll look in a bit and get back to you sometime, it's a big list and I'm currently doing 2 things at once :L
hai
lolz
10:P
2hi hi
BANISHED
ze magics!
ok RBD the semis are puma-july and sen-mc
at least PC have the better games
is it me or did these ads make the apple guy look like a giant douche
i'm on an Asus, running windows. Oh look, a right mouse button
I use a mac and couldn't care less about this debate
hi
I hate that song
also, I'll have to install windows on it anyway
Windows on Mac defeats the point, in my mind
since uni wants us to work with visual studio
those jerks
I don't care about the debate, I like being in a middle of a debate war despite which side is winning
I'll just partition it
I don't use Mac or PC. I use an abacus.
NewManiac is now friends with Luna
Elky, Visual Studio is BAWS for programming/debugging.
maybe try out linux too
sounds like Shaggy
I just have to use it for the cli compiler
SilverMane, what you talkin' 'bou?
'bout*
Spent my college time as a huge Mac elitist. Finished and looked for work, no company ever uses macs. mfw
and I suck at programming anyway
hey, random fact: The voice of Shaggy from Scooby Doo is now a DJ at a radio station near Flint, Michigan
haha thats awesome
heh
Newmaniac, Luna uses an Abacus in most of her fanfics
KILL IT WITH FIRE
lunaxabacus is best ship
LunaxAbacus I have an image for that
SilverMane, okay. I don't read a lot of Luna fic.
And I would like to see that image.
so rainbro is the only mod that's active?
nice

argh
damn silent hill monsters
in one hour he will be gone aswell
Has anypony made aan Albuquerque PMV?
she has a nightmare where she found Abacus in bed with Celestia.
I can't see any picture mane
i love Youth of the Nation
theres no picture, try again
go to Equestria Daily, search for the fanfic Progress, it's on that page
did you finish the game yet srake?
I got the picture.
no
stuck?
no
6Just gonna leave this here while I do some work on the site...
damn monster keep getting me
Srake, she was going to ruin the party. We couldn't have that.
6Be back to streaming in a bit.

4So sorry guys

4Jesus

6I'm still gonna be here.
4Shit took me much, much longer than anticipated; I got locked outside my house for about 20 minutes
6Just updating the homepage with next week's lineup.
well then screw you sprinkles! gawsh, makin me say bye and shit
sounds vaguely threatening
kidding kidding don't kill me!
6That. Sucks.
o.o
how long is this loop?
1 hr at least
FOREREVER
:)
∞
So, Srake how's the game?
why didn't they do the Equestria Girls song for an hour? or even Nyan Pony
that'd have been great silver
oh well
I survived over an hour of Nyan Pony once... was... horrific
This video is going to last FOORREEEEVEEERRR
10welcome back :>
My fondest memory of Yardiovich's stream was watching all of the 1 hour Equestria Girls.
I had a screencap of me watching 1 hour of equestria girls but I deleted it today
wow
Wierd
we called it "The Man Challenge."
guys I'm back
i got about 20 minutes into EQ Girls loop before i got bored
Those who quit were shunned.
4ANYWAYS
wandered off to do other stuff
4yeah
I was at the filly stream, why were those fighting by the way?
I finished it...
4I apologize for taking so long
Srake, how was it?
speaking of, I have video games to play, like the Uncharted 3 beta
10hey y'all
@Srake *clopclopclop*
Fun, right?
It was weird
ok game though
It was also creepy
oh, welcome back at sane country srake
needs sequels or more length
creepy? not so much
but weirdd
Hey, who here has read Bittersweet?
Such is the fate of Blank Flanks
Rainbro have you installed Killing Floor
Srake, she was going to ruin the party. We coudn't have that.
@SilverMane Depends on what you are talking about, does the character have a scarf and the other has a bow?
yep
then no
@Darf14 what are you talking about?
its still going? xD
Isnt blank flank really just a ripoff of big fish?
Oh I thought you are talking about something else
nevermind
Bittersweet is a sad-fic starring RD and PP, really long, but awesome
we're on a loop while sprinkles works on the site trollside
Yeah I was thinking of something else completely
to be an alicorn is sadder
:S
uh... okay
the first chapter parodies the saddest episode of Scrubs perfectly
Three words: circle of Friends.
04Is everyone in a more talkative mood today?
to be an Alicorn IS pretty sad. The Sun Never Sets is depressing
saddest episode of scrubs? I remember something like that...
I wish I was
which one was that?
Elky, the one with How To Save A Life?
ugh, epic sax is melting my memory
I'll look it up at eqd
10kalas if you're still here dude thanks i was sorting some stuff out
rawr
10hoping for a july - mc final personally
I'm still here
same
10I think so
What is the song that somepony said to listen to while reading Circle Of Friends?
10checkan
id bring it up but ive said it earlier and id look like an ass
I'll be home in a while
saddest episode of Scrubs is the one with the funeral of the one guy who's nameslips my memory
Circle of Friends?
that way you can help us get Ghosties's achievements
4Sprinkles, what did you want to talk about
7Drake?
heh
4And yes, I WANT MR. FOSTER
How does he play Saxophone with one hand
Dang, I thought it ended
magic
cause hes epic
but mostly I want to see good games
oh fuck, one of those fics. and now I need to read it
i need to read 33 more fics by next Sunday
i heard that most of the quarterfinals sucked
many <10 minute matches
I'm officially sick of shipfics
10>.<
how to save a life would be pretty sad with a fic like this
Ghosties here's the plan
4i don't like being idle
why srake?
10I want some good, straight up macro matches with long bouts of harassment
we make a password-protected beginner room
Just way tooooo many
wich one silver?
and get the ten achievements
hm
we leave the map achievement for last
bittersweet?
4Sounds good. Also, question?
silver: why, are you a prereader at eqd?
10harassment and people trying to out-macro, instead of manage to all in harder
4Can it just be me, you, and RBD in the game?
when it's time for the map achievement, we go into another server, with actually experienced players
4I'd like to play with people I know >>
or do you have a personal schedule?
4That's fine then
pretty much this
i'm soooo going to bed with this tune in my head...
later on
I would love to become a prereader, as I have nothing after work typically
so whats next fridays choices
yeah, for the first ten
The last one...we're going to need heavy backup, baby
so you just read up on fanfics for fun?
this tune is driving me crazy, isn't that right Mr Computer mouse
4What's the last one like?
we have to kill the Patriach, and he is a BITCH
but I'm affraid that this will be pretty cheesy
pretty much, I keep a Fanfic Faves post on Flankbook, which I need to do today or tomorrow again
anyone? D:
4You mean the "COME ONE, COME ALL" wears a top hat and has a chain gun guy?
Beating Abusement Park in Normal or Above
SilverMane, Circle Of Friends is a sadfic. Here is the link: http://miburl.com/XWXb3I . But you have to read it while listening to this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Ih_Bvnjpc.
10it's MC. He doesn't seem to 4Gate as much as he used to but still...
yes.
4Ah, and we have to beat him on Normal or above?
it's okay darf
bleh nvm
A walk down the trail
you're perfectly sane
also the one I got for map (Hard) is called "Dog and Pony Show" : 3
yeah
troll
next weeks stuff is The Godfather, Battlefield Earth
the godfather
Hello everypony
Green isn't your Color, and something else
4Hmm, I see
oh ok
over a barrel
hello Eldrad
OH I guess I am not going insane
oh god
10thetrollside click Home
10it should be up there

10>it isn't

it'll be fun
I want you to do something now.
Okey Dokey Lokie *pulls out knife*
dude, I need to listen to this song 'Baked Bads' and re-read the forbidden fiction again
oh come on, it's okay to say cupcakes
4What's that
is it the c word fic?
:O
are we allowed to talk about it again?
SilverMane, YOU DO NOT READ THAT FIC! EVER!
10it's The Godfather, Battlefield Earth, over a barrel and Green isn't your colour thetrollside
make sure you read an improved version
the spelling is much better
Newmaniac: I've read the updated 1st issue with all alt endings
i will never read cupcakes, id lke to keep my sanity
4Oh, that reminds me. Gotta update the Steam
I need to read the sequels still
why is everybody going batshit insane as soon as cupcakes is mentioned?
good for you thetrollside, it's something you don't want to take lightly
i don't get it
Cupcakes 2 is fucking awesome.
I don't even know of any sequels
because it's like talking about Two Girls One Cup when everyone has seen it
There's a sequal?! NOOOOOO!!!
two sequels ,and a prequel in the works
heh
so who dies in the 2nd?
I think it's bedtime
DON'T TELL ME
I want you to check the summer achievements you've got
Cupcakes 2 is a Silence Of The Lambs parody. And it is AWESOME!
the cupcakes machine never stops...
goodnight everybody! =D
10Guise can we not have cupcakes discussion kthxbai, positive, negative, sequel, don't really care
and 3rd apprently
fun fact: never saw 2 girls one cup
and tell them to me
and will never see that shit
see, Rainbrodash doesn't want us talking about it, that's why I don't directly name it
okay rainbro, we're gonna talk about 2 girls 1 cup
we'll make our game plan accordingly
im seriously
10SilverMane check your pm please
mmm, chocolate soft serve
who would hate RD so much ti write a fic like that
I haven't seen it either
>:/
thetrollside, a number of ponies.
Ugh, that girl and a cup gave me nightmares *shivers*
trollside, nothing to do with hate

so...
why wub u
what do we do now?
(party hard)
Wait until his computer station times out from streaming I guess
Elky, massive clopfest.
uh... okay
There was a discussion that somehow got around to talking about RedTube roulette and motherless
last week, I think it was
what's redtube roulette?
I know motherless is a game...
gg
You have Elky interested.
oh lord
7._.
hrm
HRM
HMMMM
everything is breaking
/me ponders
have i missed anything?
this isn't something I'll regret knowing?
/me 12balances ot the colours :3
12*out
Anyone care to explain? I'm dying of laughter right now and I don't think I can do it justice
It's on the internet and it's obscure, what do you think?
oh god. I come back and people are talking about motherless
oshit
10At least wait till mods are asleep
4Nothing much, we're just closing the stream
10;)
Well I guess that means I'll hit the sack too. Night ya'll.
Elky, I'm guessing, like Chatroulette with more tits.
Yes, mods need their chloroform, then BMN afterdark can really begin
alrighty, killing floor soon?
I thought chatroulette was exclusively penises?
Night, WhatPayne, may your dreams be filled with Deathstalker's cheesy one-liners
night payne
Ugh.
Thanks
Nope, totally different
10night what_payne
10ffff

/me hates tinychat when a channel gets active.
10whatpayne
Bye, Payne.
4Yeah, DCD is already in and he's waiting for us
:)
YOU GOT MAIL
I've seen way, way, way too many masterbators on Tinychat.
Redtube roulette is taking four random numbers (generally from a post on an imageboard)
I'll go when the stream is over
4Same here
ANSWER YOUR DAMN MAIL SPRINKLES!
and putting it in the redtube video URL
plus I want to make sure this motherless discussion doesn't continue while I'm here
which will return porn?
And you must watch/clop to it, no matter how horrendous you may find it
oh, okay
precisely
12fff, I lost my coloured layers D:
I've seen some of this on 4chan, but really, who does that?
I don't mind people talking about porn late in stream, but some of the stuff on that website..
oh lawdy
4Motherless?
Okay. *closes eyes* 6483. Someone now has to do that. Lord knows I won't.
4Wutttttt
I always thought it was trolling
Not it.
Given what's on redtube, it could be
>implying it's possible to clop with epic sax guy on
it's like fancy european wording for "bastard"
I guess?
WELP
epic sax guy is pure unfiltered sex
10>implying I don't clop to epic sax guy
At least there's a girl involved
dat pelvic thrusting
oh. lol
no no no
>implying spike humping is not DEAD SEXY
it's a porn site
RainBroDash
4Motherless is a...uh
4Yeah
4Porn sit
4e
let's call it that.
I nominate *closes eyes and runs finger along chat list* Kalas.
I think why you got mod
now that you mention it... he is oddly endearing
that's more belly thrusting than pelvic...
really?
FFFFFFFFF
I'm guessing a bad, grosstastic porn site ja?
10kalas can't clop, he's watching starcraft matches :P
double rax
Because you went through 10 brony movie nights

If you really want a good dangergame, use stileproject instead of redtube
yeah

03LOL
03was she a princess by chance?
._.
no lol
Is anypony here?
ME IM HERE
Were you here for the lottery today?
yes I was
thank you I was getting sooo lonely..
Would you mind telling me what the showing order is and what'll be playing?
You have no idea...
Yea
um.
The first one was better
Ok give me a minute.
One was battlefield earth. The A movie iirc.
...no way.
There is no way in hell Battlefield Earth would be selected as the A movie.
yes way.
I think it was. in fact I'm about 99% sure.
Now that I think about it.
Sorry I would have remembered better if I had known I would be quizzed...
>.<
If Battlefield Earth is the A movie, then The Super Mario Brothers movie is an oscar winning masterpiece.
but I'm almost positive about battlefield earth.
and lol.
It's fine, thanks for telling me at least one of the movies.
they had some wierdies picking tonight.
and the b movie was something I've never heard of.
trying to think...
one of the eps was green isnt your color.
Im positive about that.
and the other was over a barrel.
yep
did that help?
I can't remember order.
ugh that's going to drive me crazy
ah you got it. The godfather.
why didn't I remember that XD
The GODFATHER?!
yes.
I'll be missing a damn good BMN. >.<
u not gonna be there?
Fucking dialup.
you can't watch the streams or something?
I thought I saw you on one before...
There's absolutely no way The Godfather was selected as B and Battlefield Earth selected as A. You HAVE to had that backwards.
Probably.
hey I said I didn't remember order....
but yeah then I got it backwards.
Dialup.
I've never seen either movie in its entirety, so not sure which would be likely to be b and which would be a.
It takes me forever to refresh a page on Ponychan, there's no way I can get a stream to work with this internet.
have you always had dialup?
wow it really must be pretty bad XD
are you going to be here for a little while?
Noooooo! don't go to sleep D:

I'm here until Jurassic Park is over.

How was the BMN?
yay!
it was pretty good. First time seeing deathstalker 3.
2.
2
XD
yeah
lol I can't type this late.
but yeah it was pretty.... awful.
in a good way XD
I was able to follow along with UP because of the comments in chat. XD
yeah up is a classic. I love up.
Pixar magic.
:D
so... Is it fun being a mod XD
So Deathstalker was bad?
Yes, especially during the Saturday and special showings.
lol. Yeah it was pretty bad. Like I said, my first time seeing it.
whenever chat's slow, us mods tend to be a bit playful with our powers. :D
I'll be sure to look that movie up with netflix.
lol. It must be fun. Hey I have a good idea!
You guys should do like a mod for a day thing XD
Yea-no. :P
On second thought that might be a bad ides
*idea
probably would.
Have you never seen deathstalker 2?
Nope.
Oh. Don't. Its torture.
Only on BMN was it bearable.
haha, that bad?
I had the others to encourage me.
Couldn't have been worse than Spider's Web.
I almost left a few times. It. is. AWEFUL.
I wasn't here for that...
and I'm glad based on what I've heard about it.
oh, yeah, THAT was torture.
lol
It was PAINFUL
Yup
I've never seen it and I don't plan too.
Hey, we have 3!
good idea.
No, he left
Its a PARTY!
:(
/me is using mIRC for his chat.
aww man.
I think the most comfortable chat is 4-8 people. You can have legit conversations without things moving too fast.
Its like IRL i guess in a way.
In a way, yeah, I know what you mean.
during the movies its hard. There's like 10 things going on at once. And I really like talking to people.
Especially other bronies like me.
Do you play any instruments?
bbl movie
I used to play the trumpet, but I kinda fell out of it.
I play piano
and I love it.
Awesome. Pianos are good instruments.
There's so much feeling in piano. Everything from jazz to rock to lullaby's sound good on it.
What kind of music do you listen to?
Success.
please stay
UGH!
Oh...
I thought there was a party...
11I switched to Mibbit.
Oh ok I see.
Cool :)
11yep
if I have miirc can I just join this room when I want?
Whoops.
i r confused
I accidentally the chat.
oh.
ees fine :)
So can I join this room from any chat software?
or just mibbit.
Any irc software can join the server and room that BMN uses.
Thanks.
So what kind of music do you listen too?
the server irc.irchighway.net
The room is, of course, #Bronystate
I see now. Thanks.
I prefer rock, personally, though I listen to anything.
http://toonamiarsenal.com/
\:D/
me too. I like everything rock from 60's to 90's.
Rap, southern, blues, bluegrass, rock, techno, goth...
any.
and of course pony music
Pony. :D
I don't care much for hip hop as a generalization bu there are a few exceptions.
no southern which is ironic for me.
I hate vountry.
Good hiphop is indeed rare to find.
mah typing is turrible XD
Do you have many IRL brony friends?
Country in general is alright, though again, it's rare to come across something particularly good.
Country music reminds me of my town. Which I hate with a passion.
I know that feel, bro.
The music itself isn't that bad, but its just association I guess.
Makes sense.
I like guitar music tho. which is in almost all country.
but in a lot of other genres as well.
Guitar is great when used with old rock. :)
Yes. Yes it is. Do you have many IRL brony friends?
None that I know of.
Hope to convert the few IRL friends I have. :D
Really? none?
me too.
I live in an ultra conservative racist stuck up town with a jacked up social heiarchy government.
It makes me mad.
I live in something similar. Not SO stuck-up, but it's certainly getting there.
I hang out with the more liberal crowd anyway as a general rule, and even the most open minded of my friends didn't accept me being a brony :(
It's past the point of needing to know people to get ahead, at least.
I understand that.
It was a bad feeling bc I thought he would tolerate.
:/
He doesn't treat me the same.
and I thought he was a good friend too.
Oh well. In times of weakness people show their true colors.
Yeah, I know of that as well. -_-
u leave??
aww man...
I'm sad now...
:(
Well I guess I'm going to leave :( sorry silverscreen if you some back in and I'm not here.

I just worry over stupid things sometimes
and it ends up getting me all stressed out
I do too
I know exactly whatyou mean
*what you
and it's like, I know I'm overreacting and it's really nothing to worry about
but I do anyway

I love those movies
bah, he shouldn't be scared, not after our 'conversations' during the show earlier, in front of everyone elese
