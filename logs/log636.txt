> "illegal" :D
yes mentallyeffedguy
:P
Made me laugh for some reason.
Malavolent: If you are starting up a game of MvM I'll be brining my Lyra colored Balloonicorn so you know who I am.
Wrek: It was referring to the "Go sit in the cornor" to Adam. Being a little smartass...
Malavolent: yea i know english fail :P
Buytoast: Lol'd at that insult. But anyway, someone just couldn't keep their mouth shut and Wrek told them to quiet, but then he got all dramatic about it and asked for a 24 hour ban so he could face the consequences.
05Klumzeedragon then its even more laughable
mentallyeffedguy: Not really the english, just the though of something being "illegal" on anonymous internet chat made me laugh :)
05not really that anonymous
00,10AdamTheDuck, the "*" is a wildcard
pony_9995: Not now, but you can add me on Steam. The name is same as here.
was mr I HAVE VISIONS OF BEING GUTTED one of them?
Malavolent: i thought the same before i posted it but i didnt care to "switch" it out :P
Wrek: Bah, details.
Wrek: Yes it is. I facepalmed so hard when I saw that comment from it.
00,10it just mees it wont matter what name they use as the ban is't self is on the IP
Buytoast: TheRandomkid321.
mentallyeffedguy: Either way, you made me laugh, do thanks. :)
AHAHAHA
AHAHA
echo?
Sumica, right, ok.
Malavolent: No problem :D
Buytoast: Also, flutterchu. For a similar reason. But he didn't ask for it. He just couldn't keep his mouth shut.
Malavolent: Sent it.
that fucker never shut hismouth
05cant we jsut enjoy some metal?
05jeez
05i need a drink
^
^^
^^^
I recommend some good ol' coffee, Wrek.
Now I'm not gonna drag out this topic, because there's no point to it. They're gone.
Here here, Wrek. I'll go grab a drink also. We'll all drink together.
BronyInstrumental: rock is not my style it more electro or dubstep
/me shares a drink with Gold_Demona
Klumzeedragon: let the extremly boringness of homework begin! :[
05seems like it
seatsea: i WAS referring to the conflict, but that's over now so yah
Heh. Twilight sitting there reading while listining to metal.
Wrek: I propose a toast too metal! :[
Gold_Demona: is it okay if I get only a coke? :D
pony_9995: got it
Sumica, are you here? D:
imma go get my drink too
Wrek: What does thou drink?
BronyInstrumental: oh. well i will jus liten to everfee in the meantime
MadSurge: Absolutely. I didn't say exactly what drink I'd be getting. :D
05beer, vodka, snaps
/me grabs an orange soda
/me also grabs some rum
mentallyeffedguy: Aaaaaargh! Metal and homework! :P
Wrek: water here XD
Hello all
Gold_Demona: good, because I'm straight edge :D
Hello Rommulus
Hi Rommulus
Hey Rommulus
Klumzeedragon: im not lisening to the stream now, im lisening to punk on spotify :D
How are we all and what are we all up to this fine day/night?
Wrek: Sounds good. What kind of beer do you drink? Only Alcohol I have on hand is Moonshine.
"You should explain why you chose the procedure that you used in section 3.2." i didnt chose, you told me what to do. dont ask me in a lab repot why i chose something you told me to do, its useless
stupid physics
Rommulus: Howdy! :) Hows it going?
/me restrains his angry breathing.
ARGH MOONSHINE ARE YOU A REDNECK nah I'm not serious :D
/me hugs Ninjazz "whos'
derp
05mariestad, staropramen
05maybe guinnes
I am good Klumzeedragon, just drawing and felt like talking to everypony
/me hugs Phase4 back. ;_;
/me hugs Ninjazz "who's a cute irc-goer, yes you are :3"
Phase4: :D Ikr
Wrek: Whoa now, you're drinking Czech beer?
Ggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
why it ping to ninjaz
05not right now
05but i usualyl do
Wrek: How does it taste?
MadSurge: Nah. :P It's all I got right now.
Lolwat. Ninjazz still exists somehere.
Oh wow.
This is amamzing.
05nothing sates my thirst like a proper cold beer of eitehr of those 3 brands
Rommulus: Well that's good. :) What are you drawing?
I liked Ninny more.
Wrek: Good for you. I haven't found beer that would taste good to me yet.
It is the quenchiest!
My friend requested a D&D symbol for their group so I volunteered to do it for them.
05Malavolent: try mariestad
05its bitter enough but still a good sweet light beer
05what is Ninjazz?
I may have to try and find taht one. My hubby and I usually drink Yeungling
that*
Ninjazz is just having client issues.
05Malavolent: ofc not
05you'd have to import it
And metal ofc.
Wrek: Oh? I don't think I've had either of the first two. I've many had european beers like Pirat and Gulden Drack. But when I don't have access to those, I drink Heffeweisen. :D
05tuborg is all rigth aswell
05though for an everyday like
05dinenr beer
05Spendrups is good
i have no take on this topic, as i've never tasted alcohol, apart from maybe in foods, just never straight from the bottle
Hot chocolate + Kahlua
:|
I just do shots of vodka and gin every once and a while.
Not too much of a drinker, really.
05rebull and vodka
BronyInstrumental: Well thats not a bad thing. :)
05the sleeziest shot there is
05but damn does it work
BronyInstrumental. Well, when you cook with an alcoholic beverage, the alcohol tends to evaporate out of it. :P
XAX: Haven't tried that. :O Just white russians.
Lol, sleezy.
alcohol tastes like piss anyways
Just crappy beer.
05Buytoast: well duh
Klumzeedragon: It ends up tasting like regular hot chocolate with a caramel aftertaste.
05thats why youtake it properly
05liek a GOOD beer
05or a GOOD drink
Wrek: Yeah. That or jager and redbull. That's pretty sleezy too.
I find that drinks like beer and wine are best had accompanied with food
05never liked j√§germeister
05also: http://gronahuset.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/mariestads.jpg
Whereas liquors and mixes of such can be had on their own
I can't drink alcohol. Just the smell of it gives me a headache.
I like Goldschlagger (sp?)
Wrek: I only drink it as a jager bomb. It's not something to just drink by itself and enjoy. :D
I don't remember what Jager tastes like. Been too long.
XAX: Oh? Still sounds yummy. :) Thanks for the idea.
my brothers ipod is locked for about 22,000,000 minutes
Gold_Demona: Thick... syrupy... black licorice.
Phase4: Legend.
which is about 0.7 years
Phase4, lolwut :D
he'll be waiting for a while
Klumzeedragon: Hmm... Don't remember having anything like that. Maybe I was too drunk to notice when I had it. Cuz I do remember having it at least once
Phase4: How on earth...
I used to drink a LOT back in my late teens/early twenties
Food cooked with alcohol however... burns my stomach.
its ~ 254 days so probably an overflow
Gold_Demona: It was probably mixed with something. Its not usually something people drink straight. Or really do plain shot of.
Klumzeedragon: I didn't used to mix drinks back then. I drank everything straight
Phase4 He could just connect it to itunes
22429288 minutes to be precise
I mix my drinks now because I'm a lot more responsible with the amount I consume. XP
drummers aren't musicians, they're percussionists
Gold_Demona: That's crazy. I can't drink many things straight. Just Whiskey, Rum, and some Vodkas. Usually if it's flavoured. :D
BronyInstrumental: Who says percussion isn't music? O_o
My brother takes offence to that, BronyInstrumental.
Gold_Demona: my dad, basically
I mix my drinks because all we have is beer, wine a little bit of brandy and brandy is too expensive
Ninjazz: good for him
Eh. He can deal with it.
what's the name of the guy who hangs with the musicians backstage at concerts? the drummer
Klumzeedragon: Well, trying the drinks straight comes in handy when experimenting with mixing. You know what everything tastes like on their own. :P
But he did say "fawk you".
BronyInstrumental, wiki redirects from percussionists to percussion instruments, so it either agrees or disagrees. either way it considers them unimportant
Mutterguy: I hope it's decent Brandy. :S And not like... cooking brandy. I know a few people who drink the bottom shelf cooking stuff.
Phase4: as they are
I've heard several chefs say "never cook with a wine you wouldn't drink"
No idea. probably real. not like I drink that much
Gold_Demona, o_O
that just seems logical
if you cant drink something why would you use it as an ingredient
Phase4: Exactly. Cooking wine is pointless. Just use REAL wine.
the crap is cooking wine?
Wait. There's actual cooking wine?
Like wine. For cooking?
Yes
Gold_Demona: I suppose that's true. I'll probably have to do it more often than I do. :P
Wut.
why is that a market that exists
because fermented grape juice is a flavour.
Ninjazz: Phase4: It's pretty much a low end brandy.
ah crap, i just remembered i have homework to do for tomorrow
05always remember
05those fallen soldiers
i meen cooking chocolate i can understand (it actually comes out nice after being heated) but cooking wine o_O
05alwasy remember fatehrs and sons of war
05love this song
In risotto and sauces
Sons of War.
yesh.
I've seen beer used to cook poultry.
Klumzeedragon, I don't think I'd skip my standards like that.
Like whole chickens and turkeys.
"Cooking Wine". No, just brand it low quality brandy plz.
the whole point of using wine as an ingredient is for the freking wine
BACK TO SCHOOL WORK
Phase4: Wine is actually a very good cooking ingredient.
the worlds stupid can wait
Phase4: So long as you use REAL wine and not "cooking wine"
Ninjazz: I know I wouldnt. :D But there is one dish my parents make with some brandy and it's amazing, but probably cause there isnt much that goes in. But if you tried drinking it by itself, yeesh.
Gold_Demona, i know, had food prepared with it before, was real nice
still cant enjoy wine though, alcohol tastes like absolute crap to me
Still need to explore the cooking world a bit.
"There are two things that are infinite; the expanding universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the universe"
^
Eating dishes with specially prepared wines and stuffs like that.
Lol, AdamTheDuck.
Phase4: Yeah, wine is an acquired taste. My hubby and I usually enjoy a bottle of wine together with a plate of pasta.
I find that wine is best enjoyed with a meal
Well I have a bottle opener that is also a USB drive. So... yeah.
XAX, because why not
Think Albert Einstein said that, not sure though. Too many random quotes in my bank of quote laying around my head. :3
05Gold_Demona: a cream based pasta sauce with parseli and fresh pasta~
I can't drink wine by itself. It's just nasty without any food to accompany it
Eesh. 5:30am. :P Time to hit the hay.
I stick with cider
Night Klumzeedragon
night Klumzeedragon
05with parmesan cheese on top of it
Goodnight Klumzeedragon
Sleep well, Klumzeedragon.
Wrek: Hmm. We've never done that one before. Usually it's a red wind with red-sauce pasta.
05adn you eat it with eitehr ox fille or pock fille
Wrek: Thanks for the stream man. :) It's been awesome as usual.
Wrek: That sounds awesome. :D
And now I'm hungry again.
05gnight Klumzeedragon
Thank you.
05pork'
Goodnight eveypony who pinged me and those who didn't. I <3 you all.
05still onyl me enjoyign stream? :o
I can't easily get Ox where I am...
no, Wrek, i'm enjoying the Sabaton too :)
Or any beef other than regular cow.
05Gold_Demona: im not the best cook, but i love good food ^_^
Wrek: I am enjoying it :)
05so i try my best
Wrek: I would legitimately love to be watching, but I'm in my room with nothing but my iPod :c

Welcome back mentallyeffedguy
MLP_Brovakiin: thank you :D
sitting down to a delecious meal you prepared yourself. one of the great feels of life
Wrek: Food is awesome. I pretty much cook all the meals in this house. :3
Phase4: Delicious*
"- Message blocked due to repeating (+K set)" - all I wanted is to say welcome back to mentallyeffedguy :(

AdamTheDuck, ikr XD
BronyInstrumental, such an odd word
My husband's a good cook, too, but he doesn't have time to do much cooking.
AdamTheDuck, dat hexchat
i recognise the message, same one as xchat

I love it when we cook together, because we come out with Meals of AWESOME!
I'm still missing those pony emotes... :'(
wachen
Wrek: i apologies now do YOU apologies
Gold_Demona: Sounds... awesome.
But the one thing that every cook/chef/meal prepare person dreads... cleaning the mess up afterwords. Almost makes everything seem like it wasn't worth it.
05take soem gridned meat, mix it with chopped yellow unions, 2 cans of crsuehd tomatoes, 2 pieces of garlic, 3 grated carrots. some meat broth. french mustard
and flutterchu's back
flutterchu: You CANNOT be serious.
05some other shit
05perfect with pasta
Wrek: Sounds about right. :3
i almost fell asleep those 3 minutes
05flutterchu: for ban evading, you have now been put on the permanent ban list.
:<
Damn.
wait whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Wrek: You unbanned someone a few minutes back?
daaaayum

00,10*headdesk*
Oh boy. :<
I swear he unbanned 'im a while back.
/me shudders in fear at the sight of Wrek's banhammer
But still acting like a kid. :/
05silly irc timers
Wreks Banhammer of ddooooooooom
Wrek: "Wrek removed the ban on *!*@fv84-741-64-542.pv.oc.cox.net. "
:>
:D

05my mistake, pelase continue
05HOWEVER
05seeign that the first thign you say when comign back in
oh boy
Wrek: you better! :P
05mentallyeffedguy sit in the corner
00,10mirc goes by min not by hours when you set time bans
00,10so you set a 24 min ban
Wrek: i will! *sits in corner* :D
24 hours is 3600 minutes, isn't it?
05flutterchu: you are walkign a very thin line, make sure not to get yourself anotehr ban
00,102880
meh, close enough
Wrek: i hope i wont
The red font just makes it creapier
05its up to you
1480 wasn't it?
you let them back in?
Hoping you don't is a bad excuse. It's not hard to not get banned
05Buytoast: the timer bucked up
ah
05but i cba
BronyInstrumental: 3600 seconds is an hour. So yeah, closeenough.
where are those guys playing?
05mentallyeffedguy: sabaton
05oh and also
XAX: ah, now i know where i remember that figure from, when i get bored i work time out in seconds :P
Hmm.
Yay social experiements is best experiment
;kickcount otakon
/me jumps
aww.
05comments like: "<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: you better! :P" are not appreciated
05specially sicne i admitted a mistake
no, not who they are, where they are! :P
One does not simply count otakon's kicks.
00,10right 1440 is a day, I cant math at 5am
00,10sure you do Ninjazz
Wrek: well i didnt notice that! exuse me then
Tea tastes amazing... just throwing that out there
yeah you can, Ninjazz, watch
05atelast not in that situation
:kickcount otakon
BronyInstrumental: otakon has been kicked 11 times
00,10you take mine and wreks total counts and suptract 2/3
Oh.
Oh wait. Really?
mentallyeffedguy yeah careful being joke ish when in a serious situation like that.
:, not ;
Silly mess
05but yeah Gold_Demona: i can try and compile the recepie for you sometime
:kickcount otakon
Ninjazz: otakon has been kicked 11 times
Oh whoa.
Fancy bots.
00,10mind you that is just BerryPunch's kicks
Wrek: Sounds great. I love trying new recipes. :D
Ahahaha. I see.
00,10she would have a better tally if wrek and I removed our bots
Sumica, yeah, you guys and your more sensative kickscripts
i dont get you guys some times... you are friendly and nice then suddenly because someone are joking, they get banned, not fukin funny you know
05thoguh the gates of hell, as we make our way to ehaven, through the nazi lines. Primo Victoria.
inb4 spellcheck
Must be atleast 1k by this point atleast.
00,10not more sensative, just faster
mentallyeffedguy: :|
mentallyeffedguy, rules, man.
Read them.
mentallyeffedguy not joking the user who is only one mistake more for a perma ban has made several mistakes over and over again
Sumica, no, more sensetive, mines acurate to +-10ms ignoring network lag
Also, it's a given NOT to be dick.
thats a bullshit number based of how long i think it spends processing
00,10the distance lag is why she misses
where im from, when you make a joke people laugh.
actually BerryPunch is in the US now
00,10oh
~40ms to the nearest ponychat server
00,10how odd.
mentallyeffedguy: Ya gotta know when to make what jokes, man.
00,10she should be faster
mine works to miliseconds, yours work to seconds, theres a 500 or 999ms window yours runs in that mine wont (depending on rounding)
:kickcount Ninjazz
Ninjazz: Ninjazz has been kicked 0 times
yay.
00,10ahhh
Sumica, your using mirc right?
mentallyeffedguy: The key to getting laughs is timing.
00,10yeah
:kickcount Sylandest
Sylandest: Sylandest has been kicked 0 times
woo!
05mentallyeffedguy: actually. here i am tyring to deal with a user behaving like a twat. i make an mistake due to a faulty timer adn amit it. adn act accordinly. in such a situation i do not like being mocked. which even if you were joking your commetn could be read as. now with that im mind, can you see why?
yeah, mirc kickscripts i've seen are acurate to a second
05as for the rest of you stop arguign with him about it
05jeez
Sumica, as for the delay in kicks, thats probably due to the bots rate limiting
Sorry :<
Wrek: when the jokes are on you, you get angry?
/me hugs Wrek
Hug the angst out
All the angst.
we were arguing? i'm sorry :(
No, Flutters!
^
I will not forgive you. :T
05what? no. when you come off as mockign me i get angry
05which is what you did
05had it come off as a joke then i couldnt have cared less
mentallyeffedguy a good idea would be to stop now before you dig yourself into a hole.
hmm, someone pledged 4000$ for the hey ocean world tour. Where do people get this much money?
you guys can argue about anything cant you?
credit card debt?
dunno, but I sure could use even a fraction of that
We can pretty much argue about things we like.
Like best pony arguements.
And worst pony arguments.
Those are always /fun/.
lol
mentallyeffedguy: you realise that'S what you're doing?
^
Wanto to argue? Mention religion and politics and you'll never see the end of it.
dear "lol", thank you for being there when i have nothing else to say

Dark_Horst: im just playing along here :)'
dear "rofl" thank you for being there when "lol" doesn't cut it
Dear "heh, you do a fine job when all else fails.
Watching an art stream, got a cutesy blog for y'all :D

Hey everypony
Hello again, Serenity.

I was expecting more bans, actually.
I just missed t
Seems people's has been somewhat good for once.
What#s the count?
I wonder what the is the leading cause of botkicks. Flooding maybe?
Spamcounter, probably, Alchemist.
Probably for calling Sumica nice ^^
Wrek well tribes ascend maybe?
Wouldn
wouldn't mind that*
[old man voice] In my time they used to call it flooding. [/oldmanvoice]
Pony songs from youtube maybe?
ohai ponies

Wrek: Is this no strafeing?
Sumica: what is !cd?
cd stands for Countdownm
YAY DOOM
00,10"!cd" is a command that TOM responds to stateing you would like to know when the next ep comes out
what do you write too use it? !cd....something?
Just "!cd".
mentallyeffedguy, no just !cd
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
ok
thats a handy thing :)
Sure is.
I remember the days when it actually did something useful.
Ah S2. You were fun.
It's still useful
It's useful in telling you that it has no idea
I'm informed! :D
so it usually just tells you that its unknown?
yep
Until we get the real time and date for the show.
until the season gets started
Which we don't even have a specific date.
OK... this looks like Doom-- original Doom-- with updated graphics and slightly different mechanics. So... what is it?
Doom 3 I *think*
Doom with update graphics and slightly different mechanics, Kencolt. :p
:D SO ANGRY
doom 3 is on xbox i think
MadSurge: Well, you ARE called Mad surge
I don't think this is Doom 3
Okay then
I did say I think :P
AdamTheDuck: it's a classic Doom mod
Yeah I know :3
The Plutonia experiment. Never heard of it.

SPLAT
USE MORE PLASMA GUN
SPLAT
This is Wrek streaming?
Man, they're coming from everywhere. O_o
Eeyup
XylemTube: yup
Do cracks just represent recent damage or total damage?
Gold_Demona: you haven't seen anything
.—Ñ–∫–¥—â–¥—à–¥—à–≤ lol i have a bulgary keyboard
Gold_Demona: Deus Vult 2 is million times worse
MadSurge: I imagine, since this isn't the last level.
MadSurge: Final level's always the worst.
Not always.
Gold_Demona: also, secret levels
Ah yes, secret levels. Can't forget those
this is the first level of this part
Pearly as returned
awww, i mean yay
/me hugs Gold_Demona
With the nazis and the Commander Keen
/me hugs Pearly
How ya doin' Pearly? =)
Gold_Demona: :D Wolfenstein 3D nostalgia level
MadSurge: Yes, I love that level. ^^
Lol robot hitler
Wolfenstein 3D was awesome. =)
cachi01|phone: DIE, ALLIED SCHWEINHUND
Wolfenstein 3D is the bomb.
I loved finding all the hidden doors in that game.
Hug the wall and spam spacebar. XD
Makes me cry when people ask what it is. ;~;
Jmo: IKR?
Gold_Demona: Yep :D
i know what wolfenstein is but i didn't know there was a wolfenstein 3d
Jmo: what is it? :D
/me yawns "just woke up, how are you doin darlin?"
/me snuggles Gold_Demona
The same logic doesn't work as well in Doom2, but I DID find some interesting goodies that way. Like the Wolfenstein level
/me slaps Dovah around a bit with a large trout
/me is immune to larg trouts, and slapping.
Jmo: How many large trouts do you own?
ahh the best 3d realm game
Pearly: Nothin much. Just hanging out whilst I draw in my other computer.
*Minecraft water!*
Lots MLP_Brovakiin.
BronyInstrumental: Wolfenstein 3D was the real name. Before that there was Return to Castle Wolfenstein, which was more of a stealth game
/me snuggles close and watches
MadSurge: oh okay. i just call it wolfenstein cause it was 3D regardless :$
Yeah :D
Sooo guys is the wolfenstein for ps3/xbox/pc any good?
The newest one
/me snuggles with Pearly :3
I have no idea
I'm often paranoid about reboots of old forgotten games
/me snuggles with MLP_Brovakiin
Gold_Demona: yeah :(
cachi01|phone, from what I saw it did... looks like doom 3
doom 3 will be remastered
Which difficulty is this?
I can't wait
I am interested on how the King's Quest reboot will turn out though.
Pearly ikr
so I can play doom 2
that is the only reason
Gold_Demona: the fanmade remakes are pretty good
E.T videogame reboot
they are redoing ALL of kings quest?
Will it happen?
cachi01|phone: NO!
MadSurge: TellTale games is making the new King's Quest game
will someone stream a speedrun of either doom 1 or 2? Its outraging.
King's Quest 12 or 13 or something?
Gold_Demona: Then we're on good hands :D
*ahem* how about a reboot of romance of the kingdom
And TellTale makes pretty good games from what I've seen, so it should be interesting
^
reboot of ghosts and goblins?
that and kings quest was the longest games ever
At any rate they did a really good job with the Back to the Future game
it was meh
I love the Kings Quest series. It had a really fun story to it
Also Space Quest.
not sure if capcom would want to ewdo that
Gold_Demona, KQ was good
Wasn't Ghosts and Goblins like CRAZY hard?
But the walking dead is awesome
Space Quest was the one with the most contempt for the gamer :D
Yes it was
MadSurge: yes, I loved that. XD
And I loved how in Space Quest, the hero accidently saves the universe multiple times. :P
And the deaths were hilarious for that :D
Dammit i need to play that game
My favorite was in Space Quest 2, where he got ground into grade D hamburger
Anyone know what difficulty this is on?
If you waited too ,ong to get off the conveyer belt and wind up falling into the gears. :P
too long*
sleep time
Gold_Demona: and a *CENSORED* bar appeared :D
Back when you had to type in what you wanted the character to do. lol XD
Your character doesnt kniw how to ''fuck'' something
lol, No WONDER Roger Wilco's a virgin. XD
I wanted to play the game that Tom Hawks played in BIG
I remember in a Freelance Astronauts video they told the character to do something "for the love of God"
hello
hi poniesareweird :)
hey poniesareweird
The game replied "I don't understand God" :D
U new here?
in Space quest 2, when you get brought down onto the planet and the hovercraft goes down, you can type "fuck corpse" or "rape corpse" (I forgot) and you will get an angry messege from the developers XD
hello poniesareweird
Hi poniesareweird
Good afternoon poniesareweird
MadSurge lolwut
yay
Lil_B: LOL that's awesome
poniesareweird hi :)
Lil_B thats it. Im getting this game
cachi01|phone spece quest is awesome, but I don't know if the minds of current gamers can comprehend that level of thinking :/
hello
In case anyone missed it, he's on Realm from The Plutonia Experiment
Hey applejack`
slender have returned! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeM74lMOQu8&feature=plcp

poniesareweird: no vid links during stream, and slender isn't that scary....or fun in general
:D
cachi01|phone wait... let's see if you can answer the following question than :) to see if you think correctly
Ok
BronyInstrumental: Gigabit found a way in the last podcast to make it funny :D
Seeya guys
Slender is so fucking funny if u make ur little brother play it XD
/me giggles at applejack`
giggle at the ghosty :DD
Lol nope
Slender aint a ghosty
cachi01|phone you have to get through a maze, it's completly dark and you have to climp a lot of ladders, but you have a glowing gem to give you some light, what do you have to type in order to have the gem out while climbing the ladders?
Slenderman*
Slenderman is creepy, so I guess you guffaw at him?
^
gigabit gave slender a hug when he played it saturday
ok, i must buy last things to school ...
Lil_B: hold gem?
Lil_B : PING HUG
Lil_b uhmmmmm hold gem with mouth
Now on Abbatoire
!bacon
NOT EVEN PINKIE PIE SURVIVES THE SLENDERMAN
cachi01|phone: yes she can.
cachi01|phone wow, almost corret Oo "put gem in mouth" I guess you are good to go :P
poniesareweird : ponies arent weird yhere sweet
Lil_B yay :)
Play sleder on the stream!
MadSurge how can you hold it while you are on the ladders :P
/me hugs Maid_RainBow back :)
yay
Lil_B: put it on your pants, duh
MadSurge yeah i guess she can survive but she cant giggle to make him dissapear.
Lil_B : /)
Lil_B I remember that part, lol
Maid_RainBow (\
cachi01|phone: no but she can make him gigle
MadSurge "put gem in mouth"
Dovah...... Slendy has no feelings
Lil_B: SAME :D
Dovah slendy has no mercy
MadSurge tell that the game :P
cachi01|phone: brb :|
Dovah that picture is fake
Lil_B: which game?
MadSurge the game you just lost...
Dovah IRL she would have escaped
Lil_B: ANSWER
MadSurge Space Quest 2 :P
cachi01|phone: what picture?
Dovah the one u were going to.bring
cachi01|phone: 0.o
cachi01|phone oh, and do yourself a favour (the same holds true for all Sierras Adventure Games) "Safe Early, Safe often"
Safe?
save*
:)
I always confuse safe and save
Lil_B lol ok. I guess multiple endings right?
Lil_B: they come from the same route
at least I got than and then down now
*root
Lil_B: You a native english speaker?
cachi01|phone nope, You gonna die that way or the other so just please save often
cachi01|phone: There's technically only one to any of the Space Quest games. Also only one true solution. If you count the hundreds of ways you can die, there are several endings. :P
SafariMonkey nope, I'm german
Wow I have just picked up everything I own in skyrim to move it and it all weighs 5000+ jeez i should go on that 'hoarders' program :P
cachi01|phone: more like "the dev liked to put in dick moves and you might have missed a vital item in the prologue that you need in the end" :D
Lil_B: for someone who doesn't speak native english, you speak it pretty damn well :)
Lil_B Gold_Demona Madsurge ok thx lol
MLP_Brovakiin: you made skyrim referacne, You dun Goof'd
BronyInstrumental thanks :)
Dovah: Why?
i've been doing german for 3 years and i'm no good at it :$
I watched a lets play series on YouTube of all the Space Quest and King's Quest games played by a Swedish guy who basically learned English playing these games, lol.
MLP_Brovakiin: you just DID thats why!
Dovah....... 9gag.com/gag/5166730
YEAH 9FAG LINK DEAL WITH IT
cachi01|phone yeah... what MadSurge said XD or the other way around, example: A unstable material you pick up at some point may explode somewhere else when you have to jump down somehwere :P
Dovah: Thats a bit ironic, considering that your name is dovah and all :P
MLP_Brovakiin: Your skyrim speaks is reminding me I cant get the dlc for like 8 more hours!!!
Lil_B: Very good. I realised as safe/save isn't the type of thing native english speakers have trouble with, but otherwise I wouldn't have known. Good job!
Lil_B ok this game sounds so fricking hilarious
Lil_B: and you can't go back to put it back down! :D
Dovah: You jelly :D
cachi01|phone it is, it's worth to get killed just to see the dialoge XD
Like Mcpixel! Where every shit explodes without a reason!
MLP_Brovakiin: I will eat you :|
Dovah: COME AT ME BRO :P
/me eats MLP_Brovakiin
MadSurge well, I think in the fanremake you can get a bunny or something, put it in there, and throw it to the big plant so it explodes
Lil_B: english is my second language too.
You monster Dovah.
/me cuts his way out of Dovah's belly
It's especially fun in Space Quests 4 and 6, which both have voice acting in them, including Gary Owens as the narrator. XD
SafariMonkey thanks, where are you from?
MLP_Brovakiin: 1 question i have tho, can you buy land anywhere you want or are there set locations?
Lil_B: in the original it was just "pick it up, put it back down, get points" :D
MadSurge "Blow nose" worth like 100 points in one of those games :/
Lil_B: well, technically. I used to live in Senegal, west Africa
Lil_B: "pick nose" in the Quest for Glory games :D
SafariMonkey oh, sounds nice, where do you live now?
I loved the taste button in Space Quest 4.
MadSurge XD
Or was it 3?
Lil_B: My dad is native british though, now I live in Cornwall
You could lick random objects. :3
And you'd get a message on how it tastes
Dovah: You can buy only 3 plots of land, one in the Pale, one in Falkreath and one in Hjalmarch, You get a letter about them sometime after you download the DLC
YUM Gold_Demona :D
MadSurge I actually haven't played any of those, I only saw Space quest 2 and 3 and Leisure Suite Larry 1-3 on LordKats Stream
Lil_B: 4 years now
MUTATED
i'm native british, english to be exact :3
SafariMonkey is that in england?
MLP_Brovakiin: I see.
I think it was 4, cuz I think I remember the narrator telling you how things tasted
SafariMonkey u live in south africa? Have u ever went to equestria? I mean the real one
Lil_B: yeah, but don't tell that to the locals. :P
You could lick things like the street and the wall. :P
cachi01|phone: *West* Africa
There was no practical purpose for the taste function other than "for shits and giggles"
Oh
I did say. :P
btw, the "2 Guys from Andromeda" made a Kickstarter shortly after Sch√§fer started his and they said, that the narrator from SQ4 will be there again :)
Morning everypony
Hia Moopy :)
hey there
hey Lil_B and Moopy
hello Moopy
Good Morning, everypony! How are you all today? :)
Yay, Wrek won!
cachi01|phone: Don't worry about it. Most people I speak to seem to think West Arica is in South Arica
Morning Moopy
hia Pearly :)
hey guys
05think thats enough for today
bye everypony dinner is ready
so were watching doom huh?
Hello AJIsAwesome How are you? :)
DINNER
Best track of classic Doom :D
05tahts anotehr 7 hours ive streamed today
05hope you liked it!
SafariMonkey: ? that doesn't even make any sense. how could west africa possibly be in south africa?
Wrek: What difficulty was that?
Wrek: we sure did! :$
bye Maid_RainBow you shall feast well XD
'twas a lot of fun, Wrek :)
05SafariMonkey: Ultraviolence
05basically hardest
Twas awesome, Wrek. =D
05sicne nightmare ins neigh impossible
BronyInstrumental well... Technically the south pole is the north pole...
Wrek: Nightmare is a practical joke
MLP_Brovakiin: Pretty good. How about you? :)
cachi01|phone: yeah, but west and south aren't opposites
I think west Africa was one of the very few german colonies before WW1 ... but I'm not entirely sure
AJIsAwesome: I am fine thank you :)
I never play nightmare, cuz you can't use cheats in that mode. And I'm a wimpy noob who can't play Doom without god mode. :<
05Gold_Demona: aaw is ok ^_^
05though ive played doom on and off since i was 3
BronyInstrumental: No, it's that whenever I tell someone I'm from west africa, they assume I mean south
05so :|
Wham!
05i guess i love knowing a game in and out
Wrek: Me too. :P
the only real oldschool point and click adventures I played myself and still love is the Monkey island Series
If u play doom in nightmare mode. U gonna have a bad time
/me sits on Vivixs head
oh yeah guys try play doom 3
/me wraps a soft turban around Jmo
Woo~ :3
SafariMonkey: oh :$
I grew up playing Doom. I even had a collection of WADs lying around.
even in german the register of books in the Library is freaking hilarious
hia Vivix :P
isn't nightmare double ammo?
05doom 3 is a different kind of game entirely
I played broken sword more than I played Monkey Island, but I want to play it
05doom 1 2 etc are arcade shooters
Hiya BronyInstrumental
Gold_Demona including the ultimate doom and tnt?
05doom 3 is the base of todays cod eyc
Hello everypony.

/me hugs all that pinged her
Gold_Demona lol
So many his and hellos. :D
How you guys doing?

SafariMonkey: Hello! :)

Oh the 90s
CreeperPillow: Pretty good. How about you? :)
LOL, Ikr Vivix?
Oh, Floppy disks.

My generation is bad and i should feel bad....

Vivix: I have something to send to you in response to your comment. :D
now even CDs or evern standard size DVDs can be too small

Hi, everypony! :)
Oh guys apparently Valve is going to Hardware.......
Hello Pinkie-Pie3175
We never really had Nintendos in the house, despite mom being a huge NES fan and Mario fan, so I grew up with computer games and amiga games
So we might see a valve console
Vivix aww :/ I never had friends as a kid to play outside with :/ not much other kids in my age group and nobody was really interested :/
I saw that I make a lot of :/
Pinkie-Pie3175: Hello! :)
Aww
Oh, and I got some underrated games...like War Gods and this one game called Mickey...USA Speedway I think it's called?
:)
Hello Pinkie-Pie3175
VenHur: Is the latter for the Gamecube?
Is there a stream on or is my thing not working?
i live in the ghetto. even if i wanted to play outside i would probably be shot for something or other
No, it's an N64 game.
VenHur: Oh, nvm then. :$
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HaS3K0tbgA&feature=youtube_gdata_player Valve might do a Steam based console
HoodyNinja: no stream
BronyInstrumental: Where do you live?
cachi01|phone: Ogod
Think of the game like Mario Kart, just with the Disney brand splattered all over it.
SafariMonkey: bistol, england
bristol*

alexxm: Hello! :)
Doing good alexxm
i have no consoles, i'm a PC gamer (granted i do have my 360 but i scarcely use it)
Damnit Wrek I can't stay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qs8KeAuYq0
And by Xbox, I meant the original.
sup AJIsAwesome
gamecube was my favorite console ever
N64, Wii and GBC ... maby buying an normal GB in big grey
I just noticed this, but it seems most of us here are gamers
I mainly use PC, as such I don't really know any classic console games
Venhur i have nes, snes, n64, ps1, 2, and 3, xbox 360 S, wii, all the DS, a gameboy Advance, and a ps vita
Except the XL Ds
cachi01|phone: NNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD!
I grew up on both console and PC, but I haven't been interested in any consoles after the GameCube and PS2
XD
Same here, because it was the first console I played back in the early 2000s, when I was um... 5 or 6 year old.
I don't know, I sucks at remembering sometimes.
Gold_Demona: same, the only console game i play regularly now is FFX, and that's just cause it's fun as hell to play
First console I had was PS2, but I only really played GTASA on it
My mom kicked my ass at snes mariokart
well- very first console was Sega something, but I can't remember much of the gamees
BronyInstrumental wait till u get the AHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Scene.....
Gold_Demona: Yeah, when you have a good PC you don't need console
cachi01|phone: oh, i have
But I do know that some of the earliest game I played was Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Mario Sunshine, and Simpsons Road Rage.
Vivix genesis?
cachi01|phone: i've cleared it, 100%
SafariMonkey: Especially when all the good console games are also available on PC
mmaybe, I have the controller here-
I I had the Money I would buy a NES + SNES immidietly XD but that will have to wait
Sega Mega Drive
I want a dreamcast and a genesis
/me can't find old nintendo consoles anywhere
I prefer Melee over Brawl in terms of controls.
I remember how they advertise the system. "GENESIS DOES WHAT NINTENDON'T".
Vivix its a genesis plug in lol
Gold_Demona: Only thing I miss is multiplayer with my console friends
but it was just one machine-
mom bought it down the street when I was a kid
VenHur: still better than the Jaguar :D
/me only has a Sega Genesis controller, but no Sega Genesis. :D
VenHur XDDD James rolfe made a video when he was a kid about that
we played..sonic and some..platform game
SafariMonkey: I didn't do a whole lot of multiplayer... Still don't. Almost all my games have been single-player
The one about a little star.... Running aroubd getting more stars....
What was its name?
/me remembers console multiplayer
cachi01|phone: Ristar?
Ah, good times
:)
Yeah ristar lol
MadSurge: Yeeaah, is it me, or does Atari always sucks when it comes to thier consoles?
Man, on my Genesis I had a LOT of Disney games. It was ridiculous how many Disney games I had
Sega Genesis = sega mega drive in europe
MadSurge yeah that one lol
so that clears that up-
/me sigh
I mean, they ALMOST destroyed video games forever back in the video game crash of 1983 or 1982 I think.
I have to go
VenHur: Ikr
Next period is starting, goodbye people
HoodyNinja: Bye. :(
But then came Mario...god, imagine what's the world is like if it wasn't for Mario.
byaa
bye HoodyNinja
MadSurge well it does looks and plays like a sonic game. And the stages are very similiar
Mario saved video games... The same way Pok?mon saved the Gameboy
so yeah first console I got was a Sega Genesis(mega drive in europe) and after that nothing until PS2, but my mom had some nintendos I played now and then
Which do you prefer: Pocket Monsters or Pokemon?
Im playing pokemon crystal roght now
Right*
If it hadn't been for mario, adventure games might have been top10 now
/me LOVES the songs from the Minecraft Alpha album
/me didn't beat his Pokemon Yellow until this year. :D
hello :3
/me has never played pokemon
AjIsAwesome i havent even started my yellow adventure lol
sonicandmario85: Hello! :)
herro sonicandmario85!
Vivix: :O WHat?
Never played Pokemon?
hello sonicandmario85

Vivix: Just kidding. :$
I wasn't a console kid, it was unavailable ;__;
hehe
Vivix not even stadium?

Sumica: Wtf! I Just finished listening to the Song of that, and thot the video loops!
Mode 7 is amazing, especially when used in games to bend Pitmaps like when you are traveling on a world in RPGs
:D
Oooooh mode seven is what allowed the SNES to have the 3D capability
That was great
I loved the Effect in "Terranigma"
Doctor Who? With the 9th Doctor?
Lil_B: playing that now :D
Sumi, how often do you stream Netflix? O_o
00,10more often now that I have it

Oooh.... DAMMIT WIKIPEDIA

Same where I lives, Sumica.

00,10oh just gonna leave you 15 years in your past too rose
You're an idiot Rose. :|
sonicandmario85: People have always been stupid. They just shift into different kinds of stupid

Don't stop dancing, don't even blink.
sonicandmario85: : lolol I'm not gonna hurt anybody unless provoked :3
00,10yeah that was why I said it VenHur

Pearly: You're not. Don
... is anyone else hearing a BUNCH of *beep* (ping) noises?
*Don't listen to them*
tparx:its sumica silly filly
sonicandmario85: I thought Smi had custom pings
tSparx:he probaly switched it back
AJIsAwesome_, wha?
I got to say, the 9th Doctor looked more serious than his later incarnations.
sonicandmario85: I just heard Sumica's normal ping though >_> I'm hearing like the default windows *beep*
hahah mig mac is funy as always
big
Pearly: I said don't listen to them, you're fine who you are. :)
lol dem beeeetamax tapes
VenHur: Eccleston!Doctor never stopped the Sycorax in his PJ's.
AJIsAwesome_, thanks
God, what a bitch she is.
That's what you get for playing with time.....:S
NO! NOT THE CHILDREN!
yeah the 9th doctor seemed more threatening i guess
00,10things just indiscrimnatly kill
Im back :)
AJIsAwesome_: time is a finicky bitch isnt she?
DoctoDocorWho: Yep.
how many eps showed today?
cachi01|phone: Welcome back! :)
wb cachi :)
Zawan: One.
this one?
What the hell is that?
Paradox monsters
Good ol' Reapers
00,10just in time
Sumica: dat pun
Sumica: Oh you and your silly puns.
Whenever I think of doctor who, I think of 10 or 11, even for 9's stories
only this episode showed today?
AJIsAwesome_, everyone has to be a flippin critic on what one likes and don't like
00,10rose tyler, you done fucked up
I remembered all the actual episode story's being with 9, but I forgot that they were tied to the badwolf plot :$
Pearly: Ikr?
of course it's your fault
Rose dun goofed. :D
Sumica: oniichan?
oh and has badwolf been mentioned yet? and if so how many times
AJIsAwesome_: Consequences will never be the same
ROSE, THIS IS YOUR FAULT, IF YOU HAVEN'T SAVED YOUR FATHER, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PARADOX!
Zawan: Badwolf's hinted at at least once every ep. in ssn. 1
00,10time to feed
least I am gettng back to watching cartoons
I just realized that I 'm wearing a "Doctor Whooves" shirt and watching Doctor Who.
haha AJIsAwesome_
Pearly: I LUFF cartoons :)
This is one of my favorite quotes!
AJIsAwesome_: they have shirts?!?!
I am just a cartoon nut
DoctoDocorWho, yes
Same here.
DoctoDocorWho: Hot Topic, my friend.
Pearly: That means you're gonna get eaten by a cartoon squirrel :$
wished hot topic had them LARGER sizes
Doesn't We Love Fine have a Whooves shirt?
dat awkward question
Gold_Demona: Yep.
With the tardis and the weeping pegasi
*takes off sunglasses to reveal another pair of identical sunglasses* Bloddy hell,
Cartoons are kind of good now actually, we got [obviously] Ponies, Gravity Falls, Phineas and Ferb...
00,10which whooves
Gold_Demona: Oh. Then I'm not sure.
he gone white as a skeleton literally
00,10young micky
VenHur:and adventure time
I'm sick of Phineas and Ferb, in my opinion. :S
VenHur, yeah
the hub has g1 of transformers
Bloody*
AjIsAwesome_ same here
I grew upliking HB cartoons
Jake the dog and Finn the human
I met HB
I like HB cartoons too.
VenHur phineas and ferb is the same thing every episode...
00,10a bigger paradox
9 is blunt. :P
cachi01|phone because it doesnt have much episodes
I dislike those who says that MLP FIM is "for girls"
HB cartoons are epic
YOU travel through time for weeks without any prior experience, see how stupid YOU get.
hahahaa pinkie pie "yes sir, ma'am sir" haha
Pearly: FiM was targeted for girls, but made for EVERYONE :)
I am using that for now on
oH LOOK! Dr. Who
cachi01|phone: It doesn't matter about the repeative plots, the writing's still good and the songs are fun.
#1 rule of time travel: TOUCH. NOTHING.
tSparx, then why can't people KNOW that?
I love Phineas and Ferb's formulaic style, personally.
suddenly buffer
Pearly: Because people don't want to learn, they just want to know <_<
VenHur: It's not that, it's just that people I knew were fanatics ad kept shoving the show down my throat.
thats the tardis?
*and*
VenHur...... The songs annoy me lol and the writing? Dude its just HEY I KNOW WHAT WE R GOING TO DO HEY WHERES PERRY?
Pearly: Because people think "targeted to" and "made for" are the same thing.
Pearly: Why can't no one understands that MLP FIM is a show for MAINLY MENS WITH MUSTACHES AND BEARDS!
Then the invention disdapears
Ss*
Ponyville confidential I learned alot form just one episode
VenHur: I do have a beard...
Same here
I do have a moustache....
00,10the thing is smart production studios realise that parents often watch shows with their kids
I've got a scraggly little goatee :)
hello everypony
VenHur:wel...its for little girls too
Gold_Demona, Tell then my friend this
00,10it may be targeted to kids but if they make it so adults can enjoy it as well
I have a short beard and a mustache. :D
DoctorWhoovesV10: hello me
hey DoctorWhoovesV10
DoctorWhoovesV10: Hello! :)
the i love lucy clip.. how adult can you get from that NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND that, sorry?
DoctoDocorWho: which regeneration are you? lol. :D
unles if they watched that eo of i love lucy
Pearly: That's the point. :D
DoctoDocorWho: hey you failed at your nick.
Sumica:is the weeping angels episode after this? i wanna see it so badly XD
AJIsAwesome_, yeah
/me sadly never watched I Love Lucy...yes, you can raise your pitchforks now.
I cant quite remember which one, but Im on netflix DoctorWhoovesV10
I only watched it every now and then as a child.
ROSE, YOU IDIOT!!!

ALLONS-Y
I like this series. I shall have to download it whenever I get my computer back.
ROSE, YOU. SICK LITTLE MONKEY!
DON'T. TOUCH. THE. KEY. DAMMIT!
CreeperPillow: Dr.Who is cheap, and pithy, and OH SO MUCH FUN :$
tSparx: Should I start with this one and work my way up or should I start with the old ones
CreeperPillow: I *personally* wouldn't bother with the old ones, but that's just me.
i remember that it hurt like hell
tSparx: Okay then.
tSparx: Start the entire series from "An Unearthly Child" up to the recent episode.
time is now fucked up because of rose
CreeperPillow: They explain all the backstory in the new one, and honestly some of it has changed since the old series
I started on the new series
docto
tSparx: But keep in mind that the older episodes are rare to be found.
Technically you can't start with the old ones cuz most of the old episodes are gone.
tSparx some old episodes are missing as well
gone?
tSparx: Okay then.
Yeah, lost in a fire
DoctorWhoovesV10: isnt 9 the one where he gets stranded by a black hole?
as in the BBC lost them
That's bad
VenHur: Not really, they're either here or lost forever.
Wirisme: unless someone digitalized it from the 1960's its gone
DoctoDocorWho: ur nick, add a 't' in docor
BBC, WHY YOU NO RELEASE THE COMPLETE SERIES WITH ALL SEVEN DOCTORS?!
lol, that'd involve some time travel I think
VenHur: 'Cause they lost some of them
He knows what he has to do
:(
Cuz didn't the fire happen before digital was even an option?
VenHur they lost most of the black and white episodes
Scrapped him, actually, threw them away :P
00,10because they recorded over s11 of who
00,10er s1
No fire, not to my knowledge, they were literally taped over.
STREAM WEEPING ANGELS

I don't need to call him names.
Inb4 meet the robinsons
DoctoDoctorWho: thats just brilliant
This a recent episode?
Slippy Mickey
nah
No, no it's not.
Kinixys: No, it's pretty early in the new series
This is an episode with the 9th Doctor.
00,10all the tins of food
Who was the First doctor?
Was he best?
Oh this is season one.
Damnit now i'm into it and have to watch all the other episodes
super powered nose
first broadcast 21 May 2005
He was a good doctor.
That bomb sound effect is getting annoying lol
I can't remember the actor's name for the First Doctor, but he was an old man.
MaxTheBrony: 4th for old fans; 10th for new fans.
ah
The First Doctor was actually a rather elderly man. And often a complete mystery and something of a selfish bastard. He tried NOT to help-- according to his people's laws-- but kept getting involved against his will.
The actor was William Hartnell.
ah
3 doctors? Dammit!
Knew it
sound of. doctor
Now kiss
00,10damn you captan jack grabass
>Drinking champagne while hearing the various bombings
dem Cgi
:P
>Totally Romantic
captian jack sparrow is what i always think O_o
Genocide, totally romantic
^
Sumica: Oh, come on. Jack would flirt with himself if he could figure it out.
Yay
"payment"
is it week 35 btw?
Hey Sumica, is there's any british actors you knowed that's might be the 12th and final Doctor btw?
i have homework but i forgot the week xD
a smooth criminal?
There can be no final doctor. XD
death the most romantic thing. bombs dropping everywhere lets dance
Kinixys according to the wiki yes. There can be
Kinixys: Must I reminds you that's the Doctor can regenerate 12 times?
they can write around that
They just make this stuff as they go. They'll change it.
asss?
mass?
xD
Sooo the doctot has died 11 times?
Doctor*
10
So far, yes...
nah he has
LOL
oh wait yeah
well, 11 because he postponed a regeneration as 10
Well, considering the fact that he can REGENERATE 12 times, wouldn't the 13th doctor be the final one?
its called regenration
He likes dying apparently
How come he can regenerate by the way?
MaxTheBrony - because Plot Armor
:p
MaxTheBrony: Probably has to do with their race.
wasn't the whole regernation deal just so they could draw out the show?
Wait what race?
MaxTheBrony he's an alien and it means they can get new actors when the old one quits
AJIsAwesome_: Proper math that. Meaninf that at least two other actors can play the role-- and then the scriptwriters make something up.
Because he is a Time Lord, MaxTheBrony.
And have new actors star in it I"m sure.
but he interrupted a regenration, dos that count?
Well MaxTheBrony its makes it easier to advance the plot while keeping a person who is supposed to be 900+ years old believable.
Buytoast - probably. Makes a good excuse for pulling in a new actor every couple of seasons
Ah
MaxTheBrony: Out of series answer: To give the series an excuse to use a new actor.
why would they put a limit on it then?
They could not keep making episodes if they used the same guy over and over again.
:P allright sounds resonable
time lords forever. 2 hearts and twice the brain power of humans
And that is why Doctor Who is so good
Also an excuse to change the Doctor's personality
You know the first regeneration was what is known as an ass pull
its pretty smart :)
00,10the limit is presumed, no one knows
I'm not a fan, but I imagine they threw in some arbitrary number during an episode a long time ago not really thinking they would get that far?
I don't believe it!
Kencolt: Unless the first was a regeneration, I'm not sure if the 12th will be the last.
This series will probably just end.
dat sickness
Kinixys: Precisely. Used to mess with the Master, mostly.
And then continue years later.
What happens if the doctor gets 100 coins? He gets a new life?
cachi01|phone: He gets a dollar?
Without H.G Wells's The Time Machine, we wouldn't have Back To The Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and this.
Dats scar
scary
Ok what happens if the doctor dies for real?
game over
But the masks?
explain the masks :O
cachi01|phone: last episode we got a glimpse of it.
cachi01|phone: If the possible 12th Doctor dies, then the series is over...
they live
Ill just beat death in a game of logic and get 12 more lives:)
I don't see this series ever ending
This is where the tf2 pyro came from. XD JKing.
Today, I'm going to finish feeding my mag. I'm so close.
Barbetos|AtWork: Well technically, all shows must have an ending.
he is being empted
Until they are brought back.
*emptied
creeped out again
DoctoDoctorWho: :) `brilliant :)
AjIsAwesome tell that to the simpsons
and when does the mask come?
AJIsAwesome_: Yeah, it may "end" but the idea of the Doctor and its continued showing will not end.
Oh god, he got affected too!
oh my...
goddamn
hahah
The eyes
xD
HOLY SHIH WUT?

Pyro needs more friends
The price of a Zecora is INCREASED?! HASBRO, YOU GREEDY SONS OF-

VenHur same here
I have not seen Cardcaptor
All I know is that yellow bear thing with wings...
i would watch the derpy one
Well that was full of win.
I still find Xenosaga Episode two to be the hardest of the three
a decade from now the internet will not be able to comprehend how something like ponies got this popular
I like the amarican opening to it much better I can sing the whole thing

QuinnThePegaSistta, when I was really young, I watched this "cartoon" called "Voltron". I enjoyed it back then, because I honestly didn't know any better. Now I understand that it's real name is Go Lion. I'm kinda interested in the original version, now (even though it's not very notable other than getting licensed in the early 80's).
Yea.. I am so lagging right now
WHATS THIS VIDEO CALLED
I'm in dire need of the video name/link
ekips: arent we all

00,10seeing as they are advertising the hell out of the "royal weading" eps
awsome
Nostalgia overload!
And my nostalgia, tis leaking
MOUSTACHE
Kinixys, if S3 is REALLY going to be 13 episodes long, it'll be over WELL before April 1st.
Speaking of moustache.....
ALL RIGHTY, time to take pics of my swords i added to my collection over the time of dragoncon
well one each week?
or each sat
lol Maine
MAH BOI
Kandarihu: But.. but.. s4 5 6 7 8 9?
Kandarihu those are the only confirmed episodes they could make more
I still think Xenosaga is one of the harder RPG's I played
13 episodes is confirmed
This video gave me ADHD
13 that we know of so far
05a separate studio was confirmed workign on more eps
didn't they pretty much say 13 episodes total?
05but we have 13 guaranteed from studio B
I thouht that was the rumour? That 13 was confirmed y the crew
for writing or production?
13 episodes from studio B
Were confirmed
Se.. seep.. sperate studio?
13's pretty damn short
I cant wait untill season 3
Wirisme no confirmed they will make more
00,10xenogears was far harder Spademagnes[R]
FROM STUDIO.B
PONY
PO-NEEE. *Bzzzzzt*
Seperate!?
13 Episodes?
S3 will be so 20% cool
But there is a newly founded studio that's making more episodes, right? Like... a Studio C?
so 26 all in?
I don't think we get more than 13 this season, next we will get normal, but if we get more in s3, woo
If I recal Xenosaga Ep 3 had a Xenogears reference in it
00,10studio B bought out the other studio
All i can say is they better not end it, I just got here
The super boss looks like the main character of xenogears mech
ALL THE MEMES
All the macos
I saw a dark souls ref!
macros*
This freezing is getting worse. Time to whine to SEGA about this.
All the apples
so many memes
hopefully they bought the right talen
Its fucking hard
i don't think we need more than 13 episodes... if they hurry up with S4 to make up for it :)
TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER
S4 will probably also be september 1013
memes? elements of harmony? thats MLP alright
2013*
Eli they will make more for season 3
there'll inevitably be a movie at some point too
Chocolate raaaaiiin
CHOCOLATE RAIN
lol
Lol
CHOCOLATE RAAAAAIN~
Well I would love to stick around but I have to go to another class for school
I seriously doubt we get more than 13 when they said we wont get more than 13 because of "reasons"
caos and chocolate
DUN DUN
The elements of Harmony! Honesty! Kindness! Generosity! Rainbow Dash! Luaghter! Magic!
DUN DUN
dundUN
yes!
lol
YES
Maybe they are putting the same budget into 13 episodes?
suddenly fast chat!
Vivix can we stop speculating and just say we know 13 confirmed so far
<3 West Side Story
Wirisme: i think so too. sometime during the time between start of S3 and end of S4 they will anounce a movie :)
00,10inb4 we get 13 eps of season 4 right away
SLAP
I don't think it's speculating when the crew said 13 specifically, look up wil andersons post about it
SLAP
dat RICKmare Moon
:D
keyboard scootaloo
Keyboard Scoot
Nice
Sketch_Toku_Brony: lolol
heh
Keyboard Cat!
Keyboard Scootaloo
we probably will Sumica, it's a cashcow they can't ignore
Vivix confirmed they said they could make more than that
maybe it's 13 episodes, because the 14th is a movie?
00,10it's just a matter of they probably only contracted up to 65 eps
And then we get impatient for S4 thereafter
Holla everypony! :)
OH god need to download this song
00,10after that they have to make a new contract
yes
IM BATMAN
how are things GilDash
HOoooly shit
05they didnt realize how succesful it would become
lol this song
05inb4 signign a 10 year contract
Yus
they probably have to renew the contract
Sumica: and that makes me sad. they going to get some crappy animation studio to take over to make more monies.
inb4 mlp:fim has more seasons then the simpsons
South Park ohgod
Gotta watch that episode again now
00,10it's not a crapy studio
Sumica: also they're renewing the Hub
I dont think anyone would have Wrek at the first season
Cant touch this
but there you have it
Barbetos|AtWork, if they do that htey loose money, so they prolly wont
FOAMY <3
Moomins had episodes since the 1970s
00,10studio B bought them out and have become the largist cildrens production studio
Wut
Barbetos|AtWork: they should know that they will lose the fandom as soon as itgets crappy... i hope so at least
Sumica: yeah the CURRENT one is fine. But if they renew it they are going to get a crappy company to take over I bet.
Sumica: EXCELLENT
/me shudders.
PHSYCO
Tardy
Barbetos|AtWork, thats what they said about s3 of simpsons
00,10nah they wont mess with a good thing

HELL YA
XDDD
MAGIC KINDERGARTEN
they make more money by upholding a s tandard than milking it, they're not idiots, they're businessmen
00,10they will hold steady till things start declining then they will try new things
NO! PLEASE GOD NO! NOOOOOOO!
i think i'm gonna watch the "twilight freaks out over nothing" episodes later :)
Hasbro is the WORST
The change over will probably cause some controversy but if the content speaks for itself then future productions will continue
Unless the CEO is a brony
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm bananas
One could only hope.
U liek bananas?
00,10not new at all Barbetos|AtWork
if the brony get to omuch power, we get too many internet jokes

Hi Wrek, nice background.

Gah Wrek, don't you ever get tired of streaming? :D
So much for wrek wrist rest XD
hey wrek i like how you make good art work stuff dude your an artest
SafariMonkey: You could pop out the stream and adjust it yourself
And then papyrus
Well, the trust is kinda broken after all of what he streamed in the morning.
MadSurge: Try streaming some time, once you get a good following its gets really addicting.
Barbetos|AtWork: I can imagine
00,10wrek should draw a pegasisisisisisisisisis
Outside of Bronystate, I don't know enough people who'd even want to watch me. :P
I would not personally know, but I helped some one get into it, and that is what he told me of the experience.
Fuckyeahvikingmetal?
as always
know your talking
Wrek draw a Cloud, but make it hawt
Moopy: I mean in fullscreen. popout then zoom in doesn't zoom player
SafariMonkey: unfortunantly, no way of doing that
And given my own silence during that, I bear just as much responsibility for that as Wrek.
wait so i have to pop the screen out?
While we were watching super pony time 3 my mom came to the room..... She starts saying it looked so gay and not manly........... Then a song she likes starts playing and i muted the stream and she said hey i liked that song! And i said u said it was gay so deal with it. And she got mad........
lol!@
05hardest part is finding a good pose
stop using the word gay in here dude
/me aplauds cachi01|phone
ok, the special somepony, big mac says alot and the ponyville confidential says alot
There's nothing gay about MLP
Moopy: why?
nope, not that i know of
who does his voice is just epic
Kandarihu tell that to her
cause we don't want that in here
the real meaning og gay is being happy
Moopy dude some people here are gay
Not me
Moopy: it's just offensive if you make it so...
Try showing her an episode. Try showing her the beginning.
can you please stop using that please
dat GigabitHarmonie
QuinnThePegaSistaa no one uses that meaning anymore
lot's of people have called me gay, and even though i'm not i don't give a fuck. it's not an insult, is it?
no one is using it negatively
^
00,10quick every one voge
00,10strike a pose
Eli ikr same here. But my own mom? She cant stand the idea of men watching ponies
wait wheres GigabitHarmonie ?
Eli if u are not gay i think its an insult....
it's a sexsual preference. nothing wrong about that. and cachi01|phone my own mom is one of the people who called me gay. including 2 of my brothers
they just dont understand
SIGH
/me poses like a bronze adonis
I hate my brother so i dont give a fuck about.him
He is also a brony
try talking to them Eli
boom boom! fiyapowa
A 11 years old brony
Cachi01 - Friends come and go, but family's for life. Don't overlook that
wait are we talking about sexuality in here?
QuinnThePegaSistta: i don't actually care. there will be a time i actually introduce them to a girlfriend, and laugh at their faces, but till then, who cares?
Bronysith nope
right, I like your mind set Eli
Sundaysmile i have been friend of my friends for about 10 years..... Im 14 those 7 are mt best friends they always support me
Ooooh, Wrek's is doing art stuff :D
QuinnThePegaSistta: thx :)
He's going for Sketchy Crumpled style? Will be interesting, Wrek
Games of Throney, Wrek?
NP ;)
Its nerf........or nothing NERF!
Bronysith dat organization xiii
Axel and i forgot the name of the bitchy blonde that made me rage quit in chain of memories
/me sighs "I am going to shower"
ugh
and yes they are a couple actually
Nooo i mean the blonde gir√±
L
see you then Pearly
Cachi once your friends are my age, you'll get the picture
Heya bs :)
Hello brony state long time no see :D
hello
Heya Nerom :)
cachi01|phone: she dies. don't worry ;P
Sundaysmile we've been through so much shit i dont think we will stop being friends.lol
Wrek wich pony are you going to draw this time?
Is this Wrek's first male drawing?
i dont know
i dont think so
hello, this my first time tuning in on this livestream. Looking awsome so far :o
face looks kinda manly to me-
Ohh Wrek drawing. love those, just saw his latest just saying desktop!
Eli i know. You dont know how much i enjoyed kicking her ass
05fucking colts
I never said you'd stop being friends bro, but once you and your friends have bigger priorities in life, it'll change. So don't ignore your bro
o wrek
05drawing their faces in profiel sucks
What tablet are you using?
Vivix yeah its a male but i dont think its the first.
:)
Ahh, I've never seen him draw a male
me neither
:)
lol Wrek
Sundaysmile my bro can go and screw himself
Wrek: What tablet are you using?
Eli i thought axel sacrificed himself
Intuos 4 i think
Im sure he is using a wacom
He has time to grow up
ah
Eli and killing xion in days was even sadder :(
Oh i love using old papper as a background , makes it so much easier to draw :3
He is using a wacom intouse4 if he has not upgraded
i played that part, was sad indeed.
then you dont get the block as easily
I want Intuos for their rubbery tips- I like that resistance I get from paper
cachi01|phone: he did. yeah xion was sad to. reminds me, a friend stole that game from me!
Vivix i would love to have that one aswell :)
Eli lol go get it back
it sounds awesome
I'm amateur, I have a bamboo. :P
Wrek, Try pointer curves for COlts, while keeping the sleeker lines for Mares? :P
colts can be smooth ;__;
:P
the face is the big difference
i would love to even have a skill for drawing D:
me too but i suck too much to want to practice at all
I'm currently reading about horse anatomy to learn how to draw hooves and legs
My drawings are poorly drawn stick figures lol
Sumica, you said to strike a pose, right? http://derpy.me/MhZ34
i tried realy hard but i just dont have the "wrist for it"other people tell me :S
I can't draw straight lines, but I can still draw
so- its practice, no matter what you start out with
Create to your strengths.
Wirisme: that's a bad thing. i have zero talent either, but i worked up some skill by just doing it over and over. believe me it gets fun :)
I would like to be good at drawing but just for fun not for work or anything
I hope so :)
Im going to go make myself some soup cuz im hungry brb
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #554
same here, I just do it for fun
I couldn't get a job in it anwyay, too much pressure for something I only occationally enjoy
wanna be good at something gotta put the time in :P
so whats wrek drawing?
yep
i just realized those other alphas are me
no matter what, you can probably learn it
yeah
but learning takes more than a month
exactly
could some one kick them
if you wanna try drawing ponies, i recomend Derpy to start. she's quite easy :) i've started to doodle her on blank pages all the time
00,10wait...... is that a colt
hell you can learn to fly a plane if you want to it just takes time
I think so Sumica
Well theres more to drawing than ponies :3
00,10*shock*
Maybe your Oc can be a boy again!
:O
Oh my gurd
Sumica: I K R!
dun dun duuun
It's 90% perspiration.
How to MvM: http://derpy.me/5r5vS
CAN SOME ONE KICK THE OTHER MES!!!!
It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something
I really like drawing real horses, but it's a bit hard still
well, untill after a few years of practice with no progression you will start to wonder if you do have skill for it xD
Vivix i need your help xD
I used to draw as a kid but haven't done that since
yeah when you kinda reach the hurdle, you stop seeing your own improvement andh ave to look back and compare to remind yourself
I guess whether or not I'm good at something affects my enjoyment of doing it
:P
or look to new sources vivix, kinda like broadening your horizons
Havent drawn since since the 1980s
Barbetos LOL
Sundaysmile, yeah
/me looks
Ember: I did that with 3d art. I discovered that while I was expert at technical realisation, I just didn't have the creativity. This after 4-5 years.
THANKS :)
...Oh my god.
These vocals <3
Beautiful.
Hey guys, I'm back. Oooh, first Wrek stream in DAYS
i believe everyone can get skill. how fast you get it, that's talent.
Heya CreeperPillow :)
That's pretty much where I stand too Eli
Wrek streamed yesterday?
:P
I don't know why but I love wreks taste in music
Hiya MaxTheBrony
CreeperPillow: he streamed all morning yesterday. It was a rock marathon
welcome back CreeperPillow
anyone else here in michigan
exactly :D
MaxTheBrony, it looks pretty good, but I'd look at the hindlegs and haunches abit more, and maybe strengthening the appearance of the joints on the forelegs
nope just Scotland here
wb
well, then i will keep trying then i guess.
let me fetch something-
There was still streaming as I went to bed at night
:) so lovely
I wonder if it is going to be firewall.
Barbetos|AtWork: UNtil it turned into a crossdressing British Comedian Marathon.
Or shining armor
Vivix more details ? And more correct anatomy i presume :P ?
Kencolt you know you enjoyed it
Brb going for icecream. I would give u guys some but i dont have one of those fancy teleporters kids have now this days.
Or an OC?
Guessing games are fun
Barbetos|AtWork: I was at times amused. But Twilight never figured it out-- Look! SHe still IS!
becuase i need help getting work papers
MaxtheBrony - my advice is to experiment with stuff you're uncomfortable or personally feel unskilled with drawing. Develop that then apply it to stuff you like drawing
MaxTheBrony, yeah, the upper body and such is good, and the back of the horse part is good- but the haunch and rump area looks a bit- unattural with the cutout, and the foreleg looks like it misses a joint- http://www.drgarfinkel.com/images/site/images/horse_502.gif look at this for instance- and try stylizing a bit like you did with the rest
o.o
Ah thanks :D
really appriciate this Vivix :)
BTW, the pic I linked to is my PSO2 character. Cute, ain't she?
often on strong horses the joints on the forelegs look pretty good if they're a bit eh--visible and strong looking, and no problem ^^
A gif that doesnt move? WHATS THIS SORCERY
hehe
dont know if i can, but can i post a link for a drawing a friend made in 5 minutes with no kind of expierience of that kind of style in the chat?
anyone here in michigan
cachi01|phone, a single frame.
SRSLY
im jealous of her, shes so good at drawing.
Anyone may post photo links i think , aslong as its art.
Kandarihu you could always add an extra frame and make it PARTY HARD
And now back to the metals.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/04/dark-souls-director-thinking-about-adding-easy-mode NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ikr Bronysith xD
easy mode? fuck that shit!
/me almsot always plays casual mode in games
I think they should fix PC version first
^
HEY ANYONE IN MICHIGAN USA
agreed should be super hard mode on the Kinect
xD
SRSLY
AlphaThroughZeta no i dont think so
:)
Sundaysmile, I was responding to cachi01|phone's question about what sorcery is a non-animated gif.
Vivix: dark souls has no casual! it just gets harder!
;__; but I like easy things
And thus that game became more badass.
:P
well, actually, I like heavy story and little action
I know
Pearly as returned
Then you Suck.
I doo
but I like having fun too
Welcome back Pearly :)
DARK SOULS
ISNT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY
thank you
xD
i guess im the ONLY MICHIGAN BRONY
Anyway, about that pic. That giant fish behind my back... it's a lethal joke weapon. An Event Sword called the Space Tuna.
That's pretty neat for such little experience ember
MaxTheBrony, how are you darlin?
Lol this rage of different play styles its horrifying.
Pearly i am good , how are you :)?
I'e never enjoyed hard for the sake of hard, I like hard games, but I often think running around for hours shooting super high level enemies with no health is boring
and as such almost always play easy or casual on modern fps games
Dark Souls is meant to put you into a corner until you scratch your eyes out and wonder why someone would do this to you
umm no, that is I wanna be the guy gaiden
Dark souls is meant to make you feel like you got raped
Well
Lol
she is a dominatrix
Bronysith gets it
very cruel
but then she rewards you afterwords
I've never played Dark Souls, as the ad looked boring, but hating on easy mode is really stupid, you're not forced to play it on easy
00,10hmmmmmm the only colt unicorn I know of is Derpy_Hooves OC
xD
Take Ninja Gaiden for example...
I understand there's no pausing in Dark Souls. If you get a phone call, you have to find a safe-spot of some kind.
Woah
MaxTheBrony, I am good, for the most part. I suppose!
but dark souls is a realistic game if you ask me, because if i was that guy i wouldnt survive a dragon spitting fire right in my face.
that sounds kinda fun, kinda, no save is stupid since I have things to do other than play games
Pearly good to hear!
:P
but it has that, right?
yes it does , it must have
Sumica: You mean only OCs, or like...any. Cause I'm fairly sure Shining is a unicorn :P
but no checkpoints
kick the other me Pls
/me rubs hands
i think
:P
Vivix look up Dark Souls RAGE on youtube, you'll have videos of hilarity
hehehe
Vivix: extream auto save no manual so if you screw up sux2bu
00,10yeah OC's
ah
the server keeps reseting on me
00,10suppose wrek might do a shining and Twilie pick
I now feel so unmotive for some reason
but why should I not be allowed to play it with easy mode then? I'm not a good gamer, and I suck at fps
Vivix, you could always just get better at it :P
Vivix: I suppose you could stay on playthrough 1... its easyish..
hm-
KICK THE OTHER MEEEEE!!!! PLS
:p
but yea no I'm not getting better at FPS, I've been playing for..10 ish years
THANKS!!
http://cheezburger.com/6550193920 HA
Dark Souls isnt fps
or well--yeah I started playing doom and such in the mid early 90s
but I'm not getting good at FPS, I don't want to practice
did you improve on the way to now vivix?
Well Darksouls is a 3rd person rpg?
The reason why most NES games were hard were to elongate a game, MAKE IT SO FUCKING HARD
13http://i.imgur.com/eLNfQ.jpg
Probably, can't remember
Vivix: then dont play?
if not, maybe its not the kind of game for you.
Shizuka: Dinkleberrrrg....
I won't buy dark souls because it didn't look fun for mee, but I'm just commenting on hating on easy mode, I don't get it
Shizu Shizu! Good morning :3

Starswirl`?
anyone else suddenly thinks their OC wouldnt stand against that pony? ._.
Holy hay, people are writing Ranger's Apprentice crossover fics.
stand a chance*
And then I realise I'm probably the only guy who reads those books.
Ember: whats OC?
My 'oc' is a deer, it would just fly away with rudolph powers
It'd look lovely on my wall.
Kammerjunk: possibly
an OC is an Own Character
Kammerjunk: i have never heard of em
My oc would just be his friend. I hope so
OC Is original character
dat beard
Original Character
Dark_Horst: Figures.
The OC is MMMM WATCHA SAAAY
is that an Applejack viking drawing?! thats so awesome
I don't think its AJ
cachi01|phone: MMM that you only meant well?
I think its just some unnamed stallion-
Applejack as a Valkyrie????? OH YES
does seem pretty viking though
Kammerjunk because u didnt
mine would be on the other side of the coutrey in ten seconds flat
I have two Oc's one is an earth pony and the other is a unicorn, im workign on a pegesis now
note the helmet
Vivix: I concur.
looks like stormcloak armor
Stohmklohk.
I used to be an adventurer like you, but then i became a pony.
Stormkappe
Oh.
well, the nord are pretty much vikings
lol
couldnt resist it, sorry
they just called them nord
I ususal don't write Original Character fics
Vivix: Not sure if Swedish, Norwegian or Danish.
?
im from Norway :)
I'm norwegian, I guess that line is pretty much all of it
You're dane right?
Im from sweden :)
im from Denmark
Yup.
looks like nordic inscriptions to me.
Norweigee.
Looks like "runes" guys
Eg husker s√• fra lenge siden
So much detail
(i have no idea what im talking about)
Mysterius Mare viking?
they almost look the same evertwehere
Mysterious Colt :D?
It's Batman!
I mean.
Vivix well you know me, i'm one of the danes in the chat
Both imperials and stormcloaks can go and fak themselves...
We learned Futhark runes in school, forgotten all of it
joker: *is not amused*
Ditto.

BAMBOLEIROOOOO, BAMBOLEIRA :D
hi everyone :)
dat Bamboleo cover
i thought it was applejack because of its tail :P
/me makes a creepy sweaty face "Bueno."
Hello, Lil_B.
hey
Hi Lil_B :)
Hello Lil_B!
I've met more danes than swedes and norwegians here, I think
hey
im kinda unlucky, im the only brony in the netherlands as far as i know it D:
Hey guys!
I work together with a Brony
Masdragonflare: Salve!
hey
I want to hear "Macarena" covered by the same band now.
Kammerjunk it would have been funny to name the mall city 17
Oh looks like a joined just in time :D
I think other than Jim, mentallyeffedguy is first Norwegian I've seen in a while
Applejack2012: that's awesome
Kammerjunk oh yeah city i know that type of mall. Shouldn't surprise me theres alot of bronies in this city too but as far as having heard about any or seeing any in general is a nope so far
cachi01|phone: That would be brilliant.
thanks Kammerjunk AppleDash cachi01|phone and MadSurge ;)
Who's the drawning from :D?
Kammerjunk and then get sue by Valve
oh wait
http://derpy.me/ofsLz
bearded pony?
killerpony7733: I just walk around in pony clothing articles. Much easier.
now it's a true viking
who's doing the bamboleiro cover?
Ole!
Kammerjunk wait as in a store there that had the MLP FIM clothes?
Guys?
I mean Ponies?
wuat?
since im here btw, any dutch bronies in the chat?
killerpony7733: Oh no, I was walking around the store dressed in pony swag.
Who's the drawning from?
killerpony7733 hot topic
Wrek who sang the bamboleiro cover?
I think one of hte mods were Dutch? one of the old ones? Am I totally memoryfail now?
Masdragonflare: Wrek's drawing.
Yeah Kammerjunk
Kammerjunk u know that swag means secretly we are gay right? xD
Kammerjunk aaah makes sense. But as far as having seen any here is a big no on my end. I don't have pony swag either
Vivix: Not impossible.
I guess I'll see :)
Lulu or Luna?..I might be wrong
No, Luna's from Deutschland.
I'm sure it will be awesome ;)
IIRC.
cachi01|phone: wat?
hmm..yes
i knew that wrek werent drawing with his hand, cuz that would have been impossibru!
Vivix: ViVi is from Germany I believe.
Dark_Horst swag was created by a gay group
oh yeah I remember that
VikingCanary in total we have around 5 at max i think of EU mods
but I could have sworn that one of the mods were Dutch-
Dark_Horst it means secretly we are gay
neverheard of that one
s w a g
VikingCanary yes she is :)
technically swag is just a lazy way to announce one's swagger
have anyone else watched the mov series on youtube? Rainbowdash always says swag :P
is my connection dead again?
None of the current mods are Dutch, it seems.
Swag is a very old word though
Lil_B: Yes.
I've been drawing some ponies on school
Kammerjunk thats bad :/
since I was bored and all
I hate the word swag...
05so far so good
Its just so stupid
Like YOLO
Wrek?
Lil_B: Your connection is the deadest dead in the history of cemeteries.
I'm neutral on the word swag, since its..almost never audible to me
:p
Who's the lucky pony Wrek?
:p
Vivix lucky you
Wrek: lets hope you dont fuck it up :)
swag originates from the 1700s I think and means treasure or..flowers
found the bamboleo cover!
swag (verb): To sway or cause to sway.
Kammerjunk is is unbearable for me to not chat with Bronystate right now... because my connection is so very dead
also S.W.A.G. - Secretly We Are Gay, from what i've heard
I used to draw ponies for decades ago
That would be swagging
allow me to swag you, Kammerjunk
SirGangalf yeah
Oh Wreky it looks wonderful ^_^
1500s* to sway, a bulging bag, products given away for free, (modern, cheap drugs) and festoon
thumbs up Wrek
Vivix: Da.
It probably has more than one meaning.
SirGanjalf: Yeah. It also means to decorate something with loops of draped fabric.
yeah, the original meaning is a big bag, or to cause to sway
It probably stems from Old Norse "sveggja".
yyes probably-
if that picture is done i will try to get it for my background xD
its awsome so far
svai, skikkelig herpa svai
It is.
brb darlings
Right-o.
the biggest setback for an artist is when the tools he uses are so bad that he becomes unwilling to do his art because it would mean to deal with them :(
oky-doky-loky
/me gives pheonix down to chat
NOW REVIVE
i was just about to ask a uestion
question* xD
lol
tries to revive chat
cachi01|phone you need the "Live 3" Spell to revive everyone
the whole partie XD
Bronystatre is biggest party!
State*
wha is the best way to tell your family/friends you are a brony?
bye everyone!!
why's it any of their business?
Goodbye mentallyeffedguy
bye
Ember hey guys im a brony
im trying to tell them that for a while now, but i cant get the courage to tell them :|
This makes total sense to me
Thats how i told my friends
Ember: -Hey what are you watching? -Ponies. -Oh, ok.
exactly, it's not a big deal
Ember find a way to talk about the issue like "I heard MLP was getting a big follwing, what do yyou think about it "to find out what they think before telling them (or to find out if you even want to tell them)
My tv has a record option and my mom watched My little pony was being recorded.....
Thats how she and my family found ouy
T
their buisness is that i dont have to hide what i love to share the most.
Well my plan to use this school computer for non school stuff is shot to hell
Hi
Geez i have more trust in my friends than my family lol
0,10,1
cachi01|phone, that itself is a problem.
O-o
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Weekly Media Roundup 8/27 - 9/02
Ember: Plug your computer to your TV and play an episode with the speakers on full.
My sister found out I'm a Brony
/me is back. again
Despite this computer being new it still lags like a motherfucker
EnderPillow: Resaluta.
Welcome back EnderPillow
was that a good thing Applejack2012
Dat EnderPillow
@Applejack2012 :
I guess my parents found out around the time I ordered my first two T-shirts.
Hey Wrek seriously, post a playlist of your music library sometime soon, would be appreciated
^
what was her reaction
?
:D
cachi01|phone, frankly, the proper thing to do is to convince your family that Frienship is Magic is an alright series.
05everythign is in it
Wrek want me to link it?
Would this happen to be the Mad Caddies?
05sure
Kandarihu my mom keeps saying its gay
http://open.spotify.com/user/joish/playlist/0FDICVUwvEjQaauzVjRzf0
my kind of son
I liek dat playlist.
It reminds me of Weird Beard.
my kind of song
I've seen 21 episodes with her and she still says its gay
Wrek playlist -> http://open.spotify.com/user/joish/playlist/0FDICVUwvEjQaauzVjRzf0
How is it gay?
Idfk ask her
cachi01|phone, why does she think it's gay?
cachi01|phone: Show her the IRC, lol.
Yeah my sister told I might get FiM as a Birthday present
Much obliged, downloading now
thats awesome?
Kandarihu the only thing she says is Because they are fucking.ponies
what's FiM?
Kammerjunk already did that
Well, if she thinks about the original meaning of word "gay"...
What a dumbass...
cachi01|phone: Oh.
Masdragonflare, Friendship is Magic
it's magic masdragonflare
ill try to say it like kandarihu said, tell them i watch it and that its a fun show to watch.
oh lol
I usually just use mlp
gl with that :p
I actually managed to get a streamer who really didnt like bronies to accept me being one
Kammerjunk i told her andrew W.K was a brony........she told my dad that andrew W.K composed the music for MLP
but i gotta go now people, maybe see you guys later
Masdragonflare, but that encompasses the older generations that WERE only meant for little girls.
bye Ember
cya
cachi01|phone: Lol.
Bye Ember!
*salute*
bye Ember
Kandarihu K I'll keep it in mind ;)
nice music. who's the band?
cachi01|phone: :D
Man the super boss from Xenosaga Ep 3 was a pain
cachi01|phone, perhaps some contrast is needed then. It may be neccessary for your mom to see G3, just to understand how bad FiM is NOT
What's Wrek drawing today?
He can easily combo you to death
viking pony
RASPUTIN:D
RA RA RASPUTIN
VIKING PONY!?
Kandarihu theres a video called how to explain bronyhood to a non brony...
RUSSIAN LOVE MACHINE
oh god that first clip... the horror
Kandarihu it shows a pinkie pie scene from G3 and a pinkamena scene from.G4
And Hi Aj
cachi01|phone: I love that video.
/me dance
that video was shown here
Kandarihu she said "the only difference is that one has sexy teen hair"
I was like WTC
WTG
Wtf
*headtilt*
FUUUUUU
cachi01|phone: No offense but your mom sounds like a total dumbass
:D
awesome song !
Sounds like your mother is expecting you to see sex appeal in things.
lol
I'm back baby
Spademagnes yeah she is cool and everything but she is a scumbag about MLP and bronies
^IKR?
cachi01|phone: Or just show her Ballad of a Brony. If she refuses, scream at her "WELL, THEN DON'T JUDGE IT" and sing "Giggle at the ghosties"
welcome back Vivix ;)
wb
...I haven't had tea in a while. It messes with my head.
Dammit, my chat derped
Thanks Lil_B
Kammerjunk: :D
Kammerjunk did something similiar....... I showed her cupcakes and then i sang smile smile smile XD
Wb Vivix :)
Tyty MaxTheBrony
cachi01|phone: Oh lol.
I need a name of this song, pronto!
wb
cachi01|phone: Know that fell. Did something similar.
I still find that trick you can do in the piranaplant boss fight in Yoshi's Island amusing
Kammerjunk I recently saw another "Ballod of the Brony"-like video about the same lenght and style, made by a Non-Brony, I would suggest his video even more (if yI could find it again -.- )
cachi01|phone: You learn by your mistakes.
Spademagnes[R]: the one egg kill before the fight?
Watch a Non-Brony comment video

The detail of the armour is pretty good
It's awesome Wrek
So awesome >w<
I like that necklace
So is it going to be a completely new pony?

I want to buy a white horse, and attach a horn to her head
Sumica :ohgodwhy:
will Who be on again later?
and then be crazy hippie guy
haha
:)
this song
Vivix thts kinda cruel lol
cachi01|phone: Meh, it's not the first time someone regrets giving some company their money. Despite loving some things they produce.
;__; she'll love the horn, it'll make her magical
Llevan Polka, right?
is it some kind of a cruel joke?
Brb getting a leek
or Loituma song?
SirGanjalf, I regretted buying an EA game seconds after committing to it on Steam.
00,10it will look just like clestia only furbyshaped
Llevn polka sirganga√±g
00,10and it will pur when you pat it's mane
Gangalf lol
Kandarihu: Which game?
/me spins a leek
if it has the Celestia VA, I might buy that Sumica
00,10nah
sumi don't make me cut you for those images......
cachi01|phone: ganga√±g style? :D
Wrek: wanna trade drawing skills? you can have mine and start from scratch and i can steal yours :)
00,10it will use the voice the toys use
It would be so wrong, a ball of Celestia

"CHelestia Daaance"
:O
00,10awwww
SirGanjalf, I'd rather not go into that kind of detail. Boycotting includes giving the game publicity as far as I figure.
Wrek did you mother say that?
*claps*
awww...
aww
we need a talking Bon Bon
05aye
Wrek ur mom is awesome!
Hey Sumica, did you see that pic I linked to after you told us all to strike a pose?

http://derpy.me/MhZ34
Wrek btw me gusta your AJ drawing.........

SirGanjalf: that group seems very dedicated
05he seemed understanding
My Butt Off
Wrek: That's awesome.
Hehe, probably just as well, even if it is respecable
aah hehe
00,10oh look celestia and luna furbies already http://www.micomtech.com.hk/image/Furby05.gif

Same ^
00,10cant wait to see if this ponies sword
I have another story for you all. I went to go get lunch this afternoon, and when I asked for a couple slices of pizza, the guy said "Sure, anything for a fellow brony!" I was honestly surprised that he knew I was, and that made my day so much. :)
Sumica: we saw two axes
Aww
00,10axes are also good
00,10getting dizzy
I wish bronydom had settled when I was in college, because we could use the cinema for whatever we wanted, we coulda had pony marathons
instead we had lionking and movie marathons- and tv
Sumica: why you dizzy?
00,10Spinning picture
AJIsAwesome: I would like to thank you for directing me to that video. I finished it. :)
oh lol

SafariMonkey: No problem. Anytime. :)
raubiter :)
dem russias
This guitar.
you spin my pic right round right round
AJIsAwesome: Not much I didn't already know, except some of the earlier gen stuff, but it helped consolidate it my mind.
hm. i heard this one before
SafariMonkey: No problem. :)
when i looked them up on youtube. cant remember the name though
i think it's more like "Raubtier"
en blodskontraahht
Hey guys apparently to enjoy the ps4 at full quality u will need a 4k tv........
Wrek: why does that pony have such big ears?
hehe
px is px
05cachi01|phone: and peopel say consoles are the cheap gaming
Wrek IKR
cachi01|phone: fk dollars?
I don't think you need anything over 19201080 to enjoy ps4
*4k
SafariMonkey a 4K SCREEN
cachi01|phone: as in res or price>?
SafariMonkey 4K = a theatre screen
and it'll still be awesome at lower
4 000 usd?
and people still say Nintendo is too Gimmicky... at least they give the opportunity to do something different with games, while the Playstation only gets higher resolution and better operating power each cycle :/
00,10gonna do any thing with back legs wrek?
PS3 is getting weak compared to computers though, so they have to
Wii was fun, but I don't really like jumping around while playing games-
05Sumica: aye
05cuffed boots
05of some sort
Vivix well, the WiiU won't be about jumping around that much (at least it seems so
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution ?
00,10yeah was gonna say he needs some boots
uncut horseshoenails
WiiU I haven't read about, but it'll probably be good
Wrek: how long have you been drawing on this on?
Me gusta :3
05this one..
00,10hour 30
051 hour 47 minutes
Vivix: What? Apparently WiiU is terrible...
00,10eh I was close
Wrek, steel horseshoes with uncut nails as a bludegeon tool
SafariMonkey, haven't read, no opinion
Vivix, cool
its the first that nintendo made that is 1080p
Wrek: youre a dedicated drawer then
I'm just going for the whole- most consoles were good, and most next gens will probably be aswell, just different
WiiU is going to be awesome
SafariMonkey: It is?
AC III is on it that is well something cool
Zombie u looks awesome
And nintendo land will be fun to play with friends.and family
nowerdays, picking a Console is like trying to vote... everything has a lot of downsides, I just can choose the one that has the least bad ones... and thats Nintendo for me :)
05i bet once the new ones are released
And dont.forget the multive--, i mean miiverse
05they will be so expensive on the market
05that you'd be better of buying parts to a PC
Lil_B, yeah you just have to choose what suits you best
Wrek that was teh case last release, I remember
Wrek! You improved alot! On the armor and anatomy looks Youner Colt like!
SafariMonkey: Oh. I see. Okay.
05and then you can replace parts as they become obsolete
05not the case with your console
that tank game looked fun
05jsut saiyan
btw, the MiiVerse IS NOT some Facebook like application that links every game and everything you do too your friends -.-
yeah, I have i7 2600 3.4ghz cpu and 16gb ram, etc- but I haven't blown a single paycheck
just took it slowly
I need a new gcard and am looking at 600 series-
ive been doing homework for 6 hours now, and im fukin tired
got damn internett distractions!
hehe
Lil_B i dont want a stupid facebook, facebook is shit
mentallyeffedguy man, in what kind of school are you
Ita only gpod for trolling
Its only good*
Just because we don't like something, does not maen its bad
mean*
Lil_B: its not the school its the internett distractions, i could have probebly been done in 2 hours or something
and '..yeah so forht
cachi01|phone well, maybe I'll get a FB account after all, just to get the pics and infos from groups where some of my friends are
when I was in ungdomsskole and VGS, I never did homework
mentallyeffedguy know that feel bro :/
Vivix: http://goo.gl/8ZY3c CNet review/discussion
Wrek: Having issues with the eyes?
Vivix: when you where in undomsskole? :P hater undomsskole
on Wii U?
I don't plan to buy it--
hehe
ehh tror det var.. 2002-2004/5
23 nu
I will get an OUYA for my birthday :)
OUYA will release in march and my bday is on march :)
I'm gonna get a new PC later this year, I have my current one since 2008 I think and I have been saving a lot
Wrek: will you be posting this picture on ED?
pc.
cachi01|phone: How much it will costs. Did they announced it's official price already?
05mentallyeffedguy: on what?
It'll last you londer.
longer*
pc is better i knoe but zombie U
DAMN
ohey Vordox :) I haven't seen you around here as frequently :(
Wrek: equestria daily :P
Vivix: You sound scandinavian. Norwegian?
Lil_B: Having an addiction to PSO2 atm. :P
SirGanjalf idk
SafariMonkey, yeah Norwegian
Vordox PSO2?
Vivix: Faroese here
Ooh~
I bought PC, and feel I got more value for money, but console is--different, it's fun too
Ooh, never met anyone from there SafariMonkey
Vivix: vel dra meg baklengs ut av fuglekassa! :P
hehe
PHANTASY STAR ONLINE 2!
And it's AWESOME FREE TO PLAY! <3
Solan, right?
Vordox never heard of ti... but I'm not into MMOs anyway :/
I always forget his name
Lil_B: Check youtube trailer =3
PC has amnesia, mods for almost every game, better graphics, slender, And TF2.......
well its not just that
PC is upgradeable for little money
But wii U has zombie U cabt decide xd
Vivix: The spoken language is similar to the old norse. :P
buy a really good pc and you can maintain it as really good for little money for many years
Vordox no, I waste enough of my time as it is XD, btw can I show you my latest progress? (I have a couple of questions)
Ah yeah, is it similar to Icelandic?
Lil_B: Go ahead. I'll answer to my best effort =3
<3
Vivix: Written, yes, but spoken it is closer to modern norwegian
Wrek: will you be posting it on equestria daily? i wanna see it when its finished :O
Wrek, I will like this.
SafariMonkey, cool- ah the languages. I always thought Icelandic looked really cool, but haven't seen Faroean (how u sai)
Vivix: I can understand norwegian perfectly, and can read icelandic
No matter how hard you might fail
I will
:)
Niice
Vivix: Faroese
ah yes, thank you
cachi01|phone: I recommend you to wait a bit after WiiU release - see if they'll will be more games you'll be interested. Otherwise - PC.
*there will be
^
Illusive_Elusive yep thats wrek devaintart page :)
00,10inb4 drawfriend labels this as skyrim pony
SafariMonkey: where are you from?
00,10or Dovapony
Yeah i will get a PC
And if i can. Also a wii U
cachi01|phone PC, wait for WiiU Pricedrop then, and you will see how the Console is like by then :)
^
So theres a posibilty of buyinh both
Besides: You can always buy a console, finish the exclusives you like, then sell it and invest money in PC:P
Nintendos often launch cheaper than other consoles
If not. I will wait for the price drop :)
so you might be able to get both
since the NES Nintendo has always released their consoles on the same day before black friday
/me anyone was in YayPonies channel?
Lil_B november 12 or 11 yep
My mom thought Judas Priest was tenacious D dafuq xD
Vivix and mentallyeffedguy: my mum is faroese, my dad is british and i lived the first 13 years of my life in senegal, west africa. I since moved to the UK and have lived here for 4 years. I know english, faroese, saafi saafi (local) and french and can read danish.
Saafi saafi?
thaats cool
cachi01|phone: A local language in senegal
I plan to buy some current gen console after new ones are released... And here's the question: Is Xbox version of RDR really that superior in graphics compared to PS3 version?
oh :)
anyone else that likes too lisen to queen?
SirGanjalf nope. Its just more shiny
I like them but I don't listen to them regularly
^
I honestly couldn't make up a more international upbringing. :P
cachi01|phone: PS3 it should be then:)
This pretty much sums up what's it like when people use quotes on the internet :D http://derpy.me/f7J4m
05effign helmut

we had tons of it from age 6-13
plus of course, our local places were filled with viking crap
Wrek painted the mona lisa........ WHEN HE WAS 1 MONTH OLD

Wrek: Good. You work to hard. :P You deserve a break every now and then.
I'm detecting a lot of boo-hoo in this place :S
I would not eat them on a boat, I would not eat them with a goat!
I do not like green eggs and ham I do not like them Sam I Am
Polydunami: Wut?
Nothing
I would not eat them in a house, I would not eat them with a mouse,
what band is this playing?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Aw, but I cooked them especially....
Polydunami Y u leave? :D
I would not eat them here or there, I would not eat them anywhere!
/me has never read Dr. Seuss

Vivix: What? :O

I will not stand for all this fanon! allow me to retrieve my BASS CANNON!
Europe, that's how
Uhh, I felt out of place at the moment :P

Accidentally_Octavia: I'll eat them~
Never had about him in school or on tv or anything-
Vivix *hits you with newspaper* bad
;__;

Vivix: Out of all the possble things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
Klumzeedragon: Hooray! *gives green eggs and ham*
I don't care much about the new episodes right now; I'm still in the first doctor era :$
*possible*
/me weeps
I might read it some day, but- am I too old if I haven

Vivix, you watch Friendship is Magic, right?
Ofcourse
Polydunami: :D
yeah I'll pick it up sometime
Vivix: You watch MLP... How can you be too old for Dr. Seuss?
I guess the reason it wasn't big here is because it would have to be translated-

CCCP: Fancy Pants.
Klumzeedragon: It is brilliant, I have been collecting things and rearanging my crap all day :P

And the Dude.

Starswirl the viking
it must be hard for ponies to shave!
Fancy Pants? Oh that fancy pants..
Well, we have The Doctor and The Master, why not The Dude be a time lord as well? :D
CCCP: http://fav.me/d3ha4wf
So pissed right now
Can't forget the tennis pony with those fancy chops. :P
Wrek I kinda like it without the paper bg even- looks like DnD manual-
Klumzeedragon why is derpy wearing pants?
Spademagnes[R] *snuggles* why? :(
CCCP: I didn't draw it. :D But theyre tennis shorts.

Anyone have the ability to read logs? if so can you find the first thing that was ever said here?
I didnt even knew what i was doing.lol
MadSurge: Same. :D But I love being a dick in Mass Effect especially. The choices are so dramatic. 'Click politely decline his offer' Shepard: No! FUCK YOU.
yees
CCCP: you had to have been present during that day
I'll be evil if its amusing
I thought I picked an okay response in Mass Effect one once, and she just went on an angry rampage
Caramel oh darnit :s

I have returned for a while :D
Caramel what about the TLotR trilogy goodbye?
hi Pearly
DCD and Hipster Brony made the BMN-
Spademagnes[R]: Toy horse is evil robot. Haven't you seen its eyes light up red?

MadSurge: Aw... Someday perhaps. :)

hi SuperBrony64
I want to see the logs too
how've you been SuperBrony64
hi
Klumzeedragon: a powerful enough PC perharps. But seeing how the saga ended thanks to EA meddling, I wouldn't count on it :(
Howdy SuperBrony64!
It's been over eight months for me, now.
SuperBrony64 like 4 months
Heya there SuperBrony64, how is the rainbow bread? :P

Oh you Shizuka :D
Dat evanescence?
MadSurge: I hear they added DLC that fixed the ending. :D
This is Evanescence right?
"fixed"
Klumzeedragon: and it still angers the fans because it fixes almost nothing
Hi.
Erm, that doesn't sound like Amy Lee.
To this day I still find Xenosaga Episode Three's super boss to be bullshit
SuperBrony64: Awesome. :D I'm so jealous of your bread. Did you just make it with food colouring or with flavours?
CK sounds almost the same
*hugs SuperBrony64* hello
No, it really doesn't.
I'm glad that instead Infamous is relatively short but the ending is great :)
It sounds a bit more like....oof, I can never spell her last name.
MadSurge: Really? I sold it as soon as I beat it. So I didn't wait for the DLC.
MadSurge eeyup
The lead from Within Temptation.
/me hugs CCCP back 'Hai :D'
:D
Sharon Den Adel?
But I'm pretty sure it's not her either.
cachi01|phone: played Infamous too? :$
That sounds right.
11,02Klumzeedragon: Food coloring :) But I had to separate each part of it and add food coloring.
MadSurge i almost had platinum trophy :)
11,02It took me about an hour to just add the food coloring to all the pieces.
Wow. I logged out of PSO2, but I'm still lagged. I think the problem is with Flash.
cachi01|phone: Infamous 2 is great too :D
This is a lonely song :(
SuperBrony64: Sounds tedious. Didja take a picture of it before you inhaled it? :P
MadSurge i havent played Infamous 2 :(
11,02Klumzeedragon: Of the bread?
7Evening.
But yeah, not Amy Lee. Tsk tsk, tricking me into thinking I was missing Evanescence while making a test for my students. ._. Good song, but still, bah-ram-yew.
11,02I'll PM it to you.
SuperBrony64: Yeah. :D I'd like to see it if you got a picture. :)
Wrek must have an amazing art program what is it called?
SuperBrony64: I saw that on twitter, it looked awesome goodjob!
How is you? 8)
Oh my, that drum set is really taking it.
11,02MLP_Brovakiin: Thanks :)

Guys, little question. If I were to start a NSFW Tumblr (no gore or 34 or anything, just language and maybe some violence), would anyone follow me?
05so far so good!

05the armor turned out ebtter than i had hoped

Wrek It looks so awesome
cachi01|phone: Jeez, why can't she just accept you as who you are :/ no offence or anything :(
05adn the music fits well too ^_^
You'd need to restrict your audience, CountDoofus; if it's NSFW, it's probably not acceptable for children to read the tumblr.
By Celestia's Beard:O
MLP_Brovakiin she is taking.me there because i dont pay much attention in class lol
>w<
Good lord.
Even so, give it a shot.
She accepts me but she thinks its kinda gay and weird
Dat G5 pony.
Wrek: I can't wait to feature this bad boy :D.

Polydunami: Cheers. I've got some stuff in the works atm though, so it'll be a while. <3 though!

Hey OneTrickPony!
Haio OneTrickPony
hi OneTrickPony
Hello OneTrickPony
i still dont understand why people consider Pop a genre, because just because somthing is popular doesnt mean its in the same genre
Is that THE OneTrickPony?
Hi OneTrickPony

hello OneTrickPony
Hey there, OneTrickPony.
CCCP: youp. it isn't

Eli but Pop is considered a genre
Guilty.
CCCP: really? that's BS... pop isn't a genre
Aww, I thought I was going to win Ace Attorney, this time :S
Eli at least according to the internet
XD
CCCP: yeah, what does the internet know :P
Pop = Popular music.
^
Eli many things
http://musicgenreslist.com/ pop is a genre
CCCP: it's still not always correct
gimp shut off bronystate :(
Define "pop"
Oops
Polydunami: More like this, Poop=popular music :P
I should really get to doing let's plays too
Oh hey, it's a Caramel!

Alchemist: it's not an actual genre as it is a mash up of songs that gained popularity
Caramel been here all the time
CCCP: Fine... I didn't want to state the truth. :'(
I can't decide if I wanna do earthbound or spyro first
Klumzeedragon :C
alrighty ...........o carmel stream hi caramel!
oooooo leeeets geeet reeeady fooor ROOOOOBOOOOT RUMMMMBLLLLLE
whats data install?
do your favorite game last
Eli: so it is a collection of songs that fit a parameter. What is a genre again?
CCCP: But I listen to my iPod or the Jazz station if my iPods being stupid. :P
Game is too none english
Alchemist: That site says that 'Anime' is a music genre...
Suddenly sea pony Lyra.
So?
Klumzeedragon i see :D
Alchemist: not quite the same. normal genres differ in instruments and style
So earthbound last, got it
oh hai Lyra
Anime is a genre? Lies :|
Eli: ehh, I cant differentiate between trance and house anyways
what genre has the sounds of exploding trucks?
Alchemist: And comedy too... I think they expand the 'music genre' term waaay to much.
i would do lets plays, but you've seen how bad the quality is :P
Eli: there are just as many genres nowdays as there are songs
Alchemist: me neither:P i think trance is softer. entrancing if you want
Alchemist: trance is usually softer and ambient, house is harder and you can dance to it
One sec
CCCP: indie IS a genre
oh robot wars
RoboGerbil: is there some way to determine a bit specifically than how it feels like? something more objective?
Eli i dont think that makes sense though
CCCP: why?
Disney genre, really?
Ugh..........not again
Alchemist: erm.. its like hard rock vs soft rock.. some bands do both
because many indie bands can have different styles and use different genres Eli, there is no Indie style
All right Carame-l sock it to them!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7748/ <3

Polydunami: D'awww

Come to me, Vinyl!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7539/
So who wants to be a alicorn?
Polydunami: it's really cute... but i don't like the idea of HIE
Alchemist: well one thing for sure is trance does not have singing
Pikachu: I do
what does curse of geass do
Well, it's not a BAD thing... just easily mishandled :S
i wish i was hd a pet derpy and she was chubby
RoboGerbil: okay, I will have to settle for that :D
OneTrickPony: alrighty then whats will ur cutie mark be?
CCCP: why chubby?
Polydunami: i have yet to see a good HIE story...
NocturnalBlade: because he wants to slaughter it and eat it
Polydunami: D'aaaaaw. That Derp Face~<3
NocturnalBlade so i can hug her when im cold
Because the idea of HIE is constantly misused :|
HIE?
CCCP: awwww Alchemist :(

but some are claiemd to be great
13aka NEEEEEEEEEERDS
I'm pretty good at talking to myself c:
Turnabout Storm
Zooooolovers

Kandarihu: usually used in fanfics... and usually used reallly badly... like to have the author have a ship with one of the mane
o hai LadyCanary
13canary canary~<3
OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUL
It is usually pretty bad, like a crusade against Celestia and such

Caramel: It happens.
Hello SpadeMagnes[R]
I am done with school today...finally
Polydunami: it's why i ALWAYS turn of "human" tag on fimfic
Also I may have gotten my parents to consider getting me a 3DS XL
SpadeMagnes[R]: Good luck
I always go by ratings whenever I want to read a good fic
Not positive on that...
Or manga
Haha x3
I ignore ratings and read synopsis-
sometimes if a fic is controversial it will have tons of negative ratings despite not being bad
thumbing content rather than quality
Brb I hungry
hi
I read anything really
k
Polydunami: not me. i like to find something good by myself. (not hipster)
me too haha
The hell is going on?
i have to eat bye! ill be back for sure! :)
Mmm. Sparkling Cider. 6_9
Take care Pikachu!
See you, Pikachu
bye Pikachu
nye
Alchemist, yeah- so sometimes the rating system is just too broken to trust
see ya Pikachu
Dammit! I can't look at the moon anymore without going "Hey, Luna."
tag and describe your stories well, beacuse sometimes that's all you have to go by to find a fic
Just finished drawing Rainbow Dash

That spider scared me
Masdragonflare: Share? :P
/me has arachnophobia

Never mind. I was thinking of the song. Thought it was a person.
<.<
This game...is beautiful.
Ugh I can't stop thinking about spiders literally! :(
Well, do something about the fear.
Me too c:
spiders are cute
cant stand spiders
It's not spiders for me, but bees.
Why the FUCK can't I have this game in English?
spiders are freaks of nature and should be exterminated
I love spiders!
i don't like insects in general, but i'm not afraid of any of them...
Alchemist -_(\
Spiders eat the more annoying bugs

WOW!!!!!! :D
Good night, Applejack2012
Alchemist: awesome is happening :D
And that's what we like to call space junk.
Why do I feel like I was right on the fact all the mooks have to die to kill the final boss?
Night Applejack2012!
FUCK YEAH
THAT'S THE LANCELOT
SpadeMagnes[R]: probably D:
Suzaku!
Suzaku y u so useless?

\
Missed~
Still, the music

Came back with some lasagna. I see super epic mega ultra robot battle is on, right?
GO KALLEN
boobies
AJIsAwesome: yep
See
See this is the sad part of Code Geass.
Boom!
SpadeMagnes[R]: Excellent game(s) right there.
If you got Kallen, and Suzaku, to fight TOGETHER. Think of the sheer BADASS>
ok thats a werid meck
The fuck was that :D
Veran is fucking pathetic with the double damage ring
Oh you poor kid
Caramel: How fast do you level up in this game?
not very
this is like, my 7th play through
Ok.
and I still don't have hardmode unlocked
So much Code Geass today.
Caramel what was that werid mech you used a couple of attacks ago called
Your beam is too slow for Jeremiah Motherfucking Gottwald's LOYALTY!
Man I have to wait 2-3 weeks before I can play Mists of Pandaria
Caramel: it's very much like the Binding of Isaac that way :D
Why have I not watched all these series
Holy crap that mech is huge!
Explode, BITCH.
I'm just waiting for Gurren Lagann to roll into action. This fanboying you see? Merely a warmup.
Awww, no Boss Borot though :(
'SUP
Ahaha the Dayakkaiser what are you doing here
Hey WindWhistler!
Just how many fucking mechs are there
Hey WindWhistler! :)

SpadeMagnes[R]: final boss, he brought an army
hi
Roger?
ALL CAPS TODAY
We have a hulk
Big O!
WindWhistler: no, not all caps today
Beat the grease out of him!
No need for flashy attacks here. We got fists that are huge.
Caramel: Awww. D:
SHOOOOWTIIIIME!
/me puts Caramel in a full nelson
Good ol' fisticuffs
SpadeMagnes[R]: You control over 100+, I think.
Only one has Canterlot Voice
Bronysith: who do you think I am, Raditz?
AJIsAwesome: 102 to be correct
Caramel: yes
Really, no need for Canterlot today.
These mecha pilots have used up the Canterlot quota for the day.
Bronysith: Now that's just insulting, calling him Radditz.
*Raditz.
Everlasting_Joy: would you rather me call him yamcha?
Did you watch all the anime these robots come from Caramel?
Loran? Rolan?
I don't know who this Yamcha is, but he sounds disappointing
Bronysith: . . .Touche.
Caramel: :D
They are continuing into reserve allcaps stocks, and soon they will be running off of raw hotblood.
Everlasting_Joy: how are you aniki?
Hey there
Reikim: and my other aniki
Getter Robo says HI.
GO NAGAO
*NAGAI
I felt SO bad for Yamcha. I wanted to end up being Top Dog at the end of the series. :D
the akuma of robots
Eldritch abomination from outer space? FUCK THAT I HAVE SPIRIT.
Caramel: Still not hard mode? D: how close are you?
39/51 SR points
Bronysith: I'm messed up. This week has started on Tuesday, I think it's Wednesday, it feels like Monday, and I'm waiting for it to be Thursday (homework due).
Setsuko?
Everlasting_Joy: wow
Ahaha
I forgot how much I missed this genre.
/me feels full of LIFE again
Caramel: So about... 12 more maps?
if I get an SR point in each, yes
Bronysith: Yep.
I don't know most of these mecha shows at all :S
Caramel: Go go! COMPLETE THIS GAAAAAMEEE!
Everlasting_Joy: i still havent gotten used to the fact that my univ started in august, i kept thinking it was spetember and i thought i missed canterlot gardens :P
twilight_sprinkle: Are you a freshman?
SEND IN THE GANMEN
Is that pronounced "Aoda"?
YESSSS

Caramel: Got the character with the awesome BGM music you loved? :D

"Only a flesh wound."
Oh
DATVOICE
I KNEW HIM!
It's Franky from One PIece!
Would you be enough of a BRO to take an attack like that?
I don't know what this guy's name is <_< >_>
FUCKING SHIELD
life: ?????
Every time
Caramel: Can you deal damage to him right now? If not, when?
Vordox, same voice actor.
WUT, MORE TURNS
haha
Kandarihu: I know
Kazuki Yao has a VERY distinctive voice :3
AJIsAwesome: I'm working on it
Okay. Got it.
NUUUUUUU
ded
run lyra run...i mean swim
wait, wat?
Man, I can't turn the audio up on the stream for another 40 minutes. I get a feeling it'll all be over by then.
Caramel: That was his dmg...?
XD
Is that Norio Wakamoto?
haha, Mike dying
And throughout all of this, Carame-l the pony sleeps.
Kandarihu: WHat? Do you have a volume timer?
lol
HAHAHA
AJIsAwesome, I have other audio that takes priority.
That is because Caramel is so awesome, even this is nothing to him
they suicidal?
Kandarihu: Okay.
Reikim: OH SHIT
Michael: Ikr :D
One does NOT simply attack the GURREN LAGANN
Caramel: :), good point.
Oh hai Gurren Lagann
XD
Reikim: WITHOUT PUNISHMENT
DRILLS
I NEED MORE DRILLS
BAD CALL RANDOM MONSTER MECH
DED
One does not simply take this attack and live.
pwned
OHAI THERE ROBOT
I love TTGL's music so much
PROBLEM?
Caramel: you can never have enough drills
AJIsAwesome: :D
CrimsonPeewee: IKR?
Caramel: ... <.< Is there a Music Library for this game? How many songs are in it?
there is
Oh my god
I can't quite remember
Reikim: sorairo days makes me feel...alive, like i can do anything, like i can PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH MY DRILL
PINK IS MANLY
If I could just have this game's soundtrack
Caramel: must be atleast 60, ATLEAST
I'll save during my next turn, and show you the library
Lyra!
If I could have this game's soundtrack, it would basically become the soundtrack for my EVERYTHING.
Almost ded
Caramel: Nah don't! Show it after before you end stream :L)
Dammit, there was a queen ant on my head :|
fine :P
Reikim: i must download video game soundtracks for my car
just make sure to remind me
otherwise I'll forget
amazingly enough, it survived being cut in half
Caramel: I may too anyway XD but no rush
Yeah Caramel, I concur. After you've kicked ass, chill off by blasting manly robot tunes.
Gainer says HI!.
brb gotta change computers
Meh
Oh look, another suicidal bot!
Get your duckie out Lyra.
OH WHAT
AGAIN
YES
THEY DO NOT LEARN
He died again hahahaha
MORE FROM TTGL
i love this music
GIGA
Yep, it's Viral.
ooooh
sorairo days... MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE
MAXIMUMU
hahahahahah
Also, Simon!
ENOUGH DRILL THERE SIMON?!?
HOLY SHIT
all the explosions
Do all of these attacks get used in their respective anime?
SO MANY DRILLS. :D
madsurge: yes
Reikim: he would reply NEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEER
hmmm
ENCORE
dare I waste this one time attack on trash?
but it so epic
MadSurge: Most, yeah. Some don't make it. TTGL, for example, has a whole bunch of attacks that would never make it due to sheer awesome.
Reikim: orly?
Caramel: DOn't waste it. Save it.
Caramel: Use it on final boss.
well then, looks like I'm using it now
13http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92diwrpXU1r193uvo1_500.jpg so apparently sentry busters use demoman hitboxes
to make a point!
Reikim: I can imagine :D
Everything has its time and place.
Caramel: Anything done by anything larger than Gurren Lagann.
Reikim: watch and learn
Again
/me is watching
HOW DARES HE
/me hands Reikim popcorn
It hit?
That one actually hit
A PUNISHMENT IS IN ORDER
aha, oh god that was funny
NOTHING CAN DAMAGE GL
Caramel: HISATSU?
Or not
they have a chance to freeze your counter attacks :P
What
So
:D
It didn't work?
so next time :P
Lawl, Caramel got pwned
What? :O
no see, the way this works
I'm gonna say it one last time.
ALL THESE ROBOTS MAKE ME EXCITED...
have to clean up the mess
in one turn, the more times a mech is attacked, the less evasion it gets
WHY CAN'T I HAVE THIS GAME IN ENGLISH?!?!
Let others have their glory!
lol
Caramel: Ah, that makes sense.
so even your most evasive mechs can get hit if enough people focus them
Reikim: Cause World
dat level
Reikim: One word. Licnsing.
Vordox: Then the world...IS WRONG.
...did it just implode?
Again
I know licensing...it makes me so sad.
*Licensing*
Reikim: Me too. :(
I would totally fund AGTP if they could get me a translated copy of this game.
just as an fyi
Again
this mech, ganleon, brasta, esther and margerat are all the OCs in this
Ganleon is my new favourite OG.
He's dying so much, maybe I should stop saying when he died lol
That theme song is about fifty shades of cool.
MAKINASHu!
Rolo?
OH YOU DEAR ATTACK GUNLEON!?
GAAAAAALEON
FECK YE
Makinaize*
Caramel: I go by ear :P
and I correct your ear :P
And stream quality sound
NOT EVEN HIS MOST POWERFUL ATTACK
Super Press indeed
need a more epic attack muahahaahah
I don't care what they have to do, they have to give Ganleon his own anime.
I DEMAND IT.
Reikim: they have OG animes after every game
<.<
AWESOME
so it's possible they will
Yesssss
It's not Makenaize?
this one is the only exception, because it's a 3 game series
Polydunami: if that's how it's spelled
whats he playing?
Sounds like "makinaze" or somesuch
Oh, Setsuko.
back
Hey Obsidian!
Wb Obsidian

MadSurge: Nope, died.
MadSurge: episode 8

MLP_Brovakiin: oh i see

MLP_Brovakiin: Pins/ Bands allowed?
Took you long enough, EQD
MadSurge: He died ingame, too. Manly tears were shed (again).
Reikim: O__o IMPOSSIBRU
I'm naked.
GANLEON ON THE SCENE
Reikim: one of the moments when there is no shame whatsoever to cry
great EQD
GUNLEON TIME
Man, I can hardly view a single attack without Firefox freezing up partway through. Someone else went through this earlir, right?
everypony is lucky less me :(
Ponies47: yup they always do :D
AJIsAwesome: Nope my school is like nazi germany when it comes to uniform, as of when we go back any wrong uniform and you will be sent home :(
Ponies47: I troll people with Pony.MOV shirts :D
how so Michael
lol
Ponies47: I was getting some lunch and one of the cafeteria staff said "Sure, anything for a fellow brony."
I voted LONG before EQD posted that article :P
Ponies47: I assume you'll show him Brony State, right?
Being naked is good.
MLP_Brovakiin: Wow....
yes
NocturnalBlade: i dont find any brony in my country :(
MadSurge: Good idea! :D
What the FUCK is that?
Holy crap!
AJIsAwesome: Nice! :D
AJIsAwesome: wow :D
Michael: well you found us, that should count for something :)
NocturnalBlade: dat counts a lot
Everlasting_Joy: Well what do you think? :P
Ponies47: A big fat "duuuuuh!"
No short supply of bronies in Canada.
MLP_Brovakiin, I take it there have been gang problems in your school in the past?
Everlasting_Joy: eeyup! :D
Damn that thing has some HP.
MadSurge: Why would you troll them? :P
So much HP................

^
/me gives Reikim a mop
MadSurge, you haven't seen the Anime?
Okay Caramel, you win.
... I didn't understand that attack
/me smacks MadSurge with a drill
need someone to stream TTGL anime
MLP_Brovakiin, if you don't know why they're so strict about the uniforms, it's impossible to reach a good solution to the problem.
MadSurge: He summoned a city-sized battleship, merged with it, and then smacked the enemy out of time and space. Not all that hard to understand.
Michael: I already did
MadSurge: He punched it so hard it broke through space time.
MadSurge: Aw. :P The poor derpy hooves. I haven't seen any bronies around and I live in California. I'd have thought I'd see plenty.
CrimsonPeewee: not yet, because of lazyness and no Netflix availability
Pfft
Caramel: lol, when?
why do you need netflix
I don't understand understand whats going on!
a while back
just torrent it
I am glad that I was introduced by a group of bronies so I am not on my own.
darn :(
3
i wanted to watch it on BS :(
These poor bastards just don't stand a chance.
Kandarihu: They just want to keep a good rep, even though the school its self is full of jerks and people that don't care about their education
Is that
A second mecha?
Caramel: Mech on a mech on a mech?
MLP_Brovakiin, well, that makes sense.
Lyra used Rubber Duck. Everypony D'aaaaawed.
Holy shit dat combo
d'aaaaaaaw
Caramel: Gotta love how all Macross are translated to song lyrics :D
Soooo much guitar
HARMONY
wat
Caramel: Wait, does it mean that Macross has the MOST music of one single mecha? XD
Vordox, that's Nekki Basara, protagonist of Macross 7, who is a total pacifist.
Kandarihu: ... Beat people with music?
Yeah, Dynamite 7 was weird.
Kandarihu: TOTAL PACIFICS?T XD
Vordox, BEAT them? Heck no! He plays his music for ally and enemy alike.
Kandarihu: Might be an interesting anime...
Vordox, it's a wierd series.
Vordox, Elite Beat Agents dance to save the world
Kandarihu: Hehe
Polydunami confuses Elite Beat Agents with Angel Beats constantly :S
dat Big O
dat is a cool arm
i never knew Big O had that!?
That Lyra is so cute, cant look away.
Caramel: Wait, isn't that Big O? Wasn't there a "human" version of Big O somewhere? Think I've seen that part(Was epic)
Okay, so the animation here is just plain awesome.
Now think.
Nice
THink how it would be...if this battle...were actually rendered as an anime.
only in murica!
Think about that for a sec.
BaconMane: Thanks for the update. Going to download now. :P
BaconMane: :O
Now wipe your brains off the wall.

0,5I'm downloading it right now, all systems are go!

BaconMane: My system is warming up. :D

BaconMane: FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU, im on xbox D:

This Darkmoon rabbit in WoW has to be the most ridiculece boss ever
Darkmoon rabbit?
0,5I only got Premium to save money on DLC, I don't care about the other stuff as much as the DLC :P
Its a reference to the monty python rabbit
It has 72 mil hp and if you some how manage to kill it it drops a pet
ooooh
thats awesome
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Did I hear right, that Big-O is more philosophical than action-ey?
/me doesnt have BF3 Premium
Right, I'll be back later.
BaconMane: Shame you're on PS3 I'd love to pwn some noobs with you. :D
Only thing is... it takes 32+ hours to spawn
Welp I guess it's randomly time
kittan!
must get ultimate marvel vs capcom 3
KITTAAAAN
I wanted premium, but I don't play Battlefield enough to justify the price of it
Happily Ever After? YES.
Reikim: he has best death
happily ever after :D
I now have 2 gift of borderlands 2 to give out and I now have a nice comic and quite an easy one at that.
this song pleases me

WHO WANTS BORDERLANDS 2?

CrimsonPeewee: I will look into it.
CrimsonPeewee: Not me... can't be arsed with that game
Ahhh... how I've wanted to see this again...
alexxm: he does it just as he dies
FPS + DIablo Go

CrimsonPeewee: I don't, but I'll try to answer your question.
Gah I have a choice.. do I get the 3DS XL to replace my crappy made 3DS or get the WiiU?
Caramel er sorry the version i saw had him do his giga drill breaker

alexxm: The attack he just did was there, during one of the battles against the AS.

Demonstrating that tits don't block you from being awesome
BaconMane: Damn. We xbox users don't get it till the 11th. :O
alexxm: In the movies, it also gets a makeover, leading to the Yokkaiser you see.

g2g for now guys, Caramel thanks for the awesome robot fights...see yall later tonight
alexxm: It was in the series too.
Night NocturnalBlade
Reikim, from Mazinger Z. I don't know everything about it, but it's pilot, Borot, seems to be a bully where Kabuto Koji go to school. But he TRIES to help him against Dr. Hell's <forgot the name of his machines>. Borot is very much sort of a cosmic chewtoy sort of fallguy. And his machine is traditionally portrayed in this game as comically pathetic.
Bye NocturnalBlade
bye NocturnalBlade
Bye NocturnalBlade have a good one
Goodbye NocturnalBlade
and Caramel I really just needed to get rid of gifts
God that's disturbing.
Reikim ah ok

What is that?
Caramel, sorry.

CrimsonPeewee: The nerve of being generous
Wind sword?

Right, that's on the list too.
I dont think i spelt it 100% correctly however
Klumzeedragon: i think they wouldnt let you drive it because someone could eaisly take that big plane and crash land it on a base.... :D
Still no release date yet? Or that one sumi showed was true.
DED

Kawaii_icybeauti: Hoax. No release date.
Toppa Tengen Gurren Laggann is the name of the anime
Reikim: Ugghhhh...When are they releasing it....

Reikim: I call zombie bullshit XD
how did you do that?
Petrified_Discord: wat?
Reikim: cause nightmare frames are stupid
yay mazinger!
Ohai Mazinger.
Bronysith: Bullshit, Knightmare Frames are awesome.
Reikim: Dude, it's the fukken Lancelot. Fuck ALL these other robots :P
sorry distracted by slayer album....
Petrified_Discord: Suzaku makes up for it, is all I'm sayin'~
Reikim: ^
This would be Hot-blooded-pinkie-pie's favorite game
CrimsonPeewee: She doesn't need this game. She LIVES this game.
AQUARION
Reikim dammit you're right
CrimsonPeewee: how much did that 4 pack cost?
hey Caramel I wanna see the rbot that fights with the squad of humans again
Aquarion makes me laugh and smile because of all the sex innuendoes goin' on.
around 150?
I should check
http://cheezburger.com/6552718848 EVERYONE STFU AND TAKE MY MONEY
^thats ooolllddd
Bronysith: i want a pony :(
but still my own pinkie pie.....
http://cheezburger.com/6514548992 SO DAMN TRUE right Caramel ?
I'm thinking now, that the problem is with Firefox itself. I'm gonna try restarting that.
Bronysith: Pretty much sums it up.
SHOOOOOOTO
Dat truth Bronysith

Kallen shows off the massive range she suddenly got.
Dat damage 0.0
The Lancelot is one of my favourite robots ever. It's just SO DAMN COOL.
Agreed
i never realized how large Sephiroths masamune was until i held it in my hands
One hit kill
Bronysith: That one's undersized. Real one's nine feet long.
my god why is my internet being shit lately
Bronysith: spehiroths masamune..eheh..ehhhh... but seriously, where did you get it?
MACROSS! MISSILE! MASSACRE!
twilight_sprinkle: dragoncon
http://derpy.me/i33vk
Reikim: if it was the real one, no one would be able to use it
Reikim: cause only sephiroth can use that blade
Bronysith: how much did it cost?
hey everypony how are y'all
I bet if we combine all our money then rob a bank we could adopt one.
This game has enough explosions to give Michael Bay an existential crisis.
How big is that Gunblade Bronysith?

CrimsonPeewee: celestia made twilight cry. i will find her and tear her horn off, then her wings and give them to twilight
twilight_sprinkle: Then you'll make Twilight cry. You monster.
I support this twilight_sprinkle
Reikim: i wont tell her its from celestia
Wait a minute...is that robot just a guy sitting in a chair? That. Is. Boss.
twilight_sprinkle: She'll still cry. Mangles ponies don't exactly appeal.

Petrified_Discord: *throne
That is awesome, twilight reading twilight
Hm... I have to go get my dad a birthday card. I'll be back my little ponies~ :P
which is till a better love story then twilight
Why does this guy sound like Lordgenome?
twilight_sprinkle: Or you do like they did in that Sunset fanfic and use a Divinity Spell and steal Celestia's powers and give them to Twilight which would make her an alicorb
Bye Klumzeedragon
alicorn
Bye Klumzeedragon
Goodbye Klumzeedragon

Klumzeedragon: Bye!

Ok I have to ask: what I
Yes

My connection's just fallen off
ah
Lyon: SRW
Wish I could watch, but sadly, I can't.

Ahaha it works now
YES
AJIsAwesome: facebook :)
Go Super Robots¬°
Michael: Okay. Nice!
Michael, that's well done
Michael thats a pretty good photoshop
Have you guys seen the dude who greenscreens ponies into his house on youtube
GO
Brad[Laptop]: I have.
ponies IRL are awesome .)
GURREN LAGANN
its pretty well done as well
I mean, you could make a movie out of it.
Brad[Laptop], I won't say good photoshop
Still can't do damage?
that's pretty basice
Dat's BS.
basic**
not really
Brad[Laptop]: There's more than one. I'v actually seen about 5 people do the same thing and it looks great.
dat would cost a good quantity of money
the more you hit his shield, the less he murders your team
AJIsAwesome ah guess i need to search for more
but the guy did thought about the picture and took care of details right
Brad[Laptop]: They're on youtube. Look up complations of ponies IRL
I guess it helps that the show itself is easy to remove the background and stuff due to simple shapes and colours
HAX.
*compilations*
Goodnight, everybrony.
Petrified_Discord: Or just skill. :D

Gaioh (or however the hell it's spelled), and his army of interdimensional beasts
Someone who looks like Akuma
Goodnight everyone, my bastard mum made me wake up at 6:30 to see if I could get up and ready for school on time when I go back -_-
Akuma the robot master
Caramel: is this the last level?
Sadly, we'll never get an official pronunciation.
yes
MLP_Brovakiin: Yay parents
:O
Night MLP_Brovakiin sleep well :)
MLP_Brovakiin: Night! :)

*spelling
I can see how it can be a little difficult to give volume to a 2d drawing heh
you kewl
/me hugs Petrified_Discord , Ponies47 and AJIsAwesome :3
Brad[Laptop], the key is to imagine it being 3D. I think that's how it works.
MYAH!
Goodnight MLP_Brovakiin:
Kandarihu I mean for when you stick ponies into photos of our world

rolo
Michael: So much HNNNNNNNNNNNG
00,10all the heavy hitters ah Caramel
hi there Sumica how are you today aniki?
He was one of my favorite characters from the show.
...
can't have anything less for the last mission, can we sumica? :P
00,10I am well
ohai Sumica
00,10alto in the vf27
Somewhere, Michael Bay is watching this and having an existential crisis.
Reikim: you mean orgasm?
No, I'm not that crude.
o/
strange mah interwebs died out for awhile there
I wanna be a llama
00,10so is the macross quarter around?
yeah
it's by Gaioh, taking the beating for the team
This is probably one of the "cleanest" irc channels around. I like it.
00,10type 7 spinzaku as well

00,10he finaly hit

oh thank god I had barrier up
00,10droped a planet on e,
http://derpy.me/hzHTW
Sumica, that's Big O. Did I hear "Ou Blade"?
God, this animation is almost as long as Supernova's.
I wonder if this beats Supernova in the longest attack animation
...So his attack was turning the planet to lava?
btw, just going to put it out there
that was 1/4th of its actual damage
I had barrier up
...
ouch
Why do most final bosses have super flashy attacks
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
ooooh I see
Try not to get hit again?
nah, this time I have wall up
if Rolo gets hit, it'll only do 10
00,10it's in the union by laws SpadeMagnes[R]
SpadeMagnes[R]: Flash, like screaming, is directly proportional to power
http://derpy.me/VGYgG all of my want
SpadeMagnes[R]: To be fair, the protags get a hell of a lot too.
Get some new moves
Michael, I'm sorry but that a bad design
terrible design
CrimsonPeewee: the picture in the sirt is cool
Petrified_Discord: and lack of clothing on females increases survival rates
twilight_sprinkle: They dodge better. CLEARLY.
Michael: not really >.>
If only if we understood japanese
I can't remember if I said hi when I came in here.
twilight_sprinkle: True, but only in theory, as no female ever has ever worn sufficient armor :P
So, hi.
I can't say it's horribl but the picture isn't made for a good t-shirt
Petrified_Discord: lol true
Hello FillyFlam
I love this boss music. It's so elegant
ohai FillyFlam
well he is the king of the world
FillyFlam: Hi! :)
Hai ponies.
Kinixys: Hi! :)
hoi FillyFlam
Is anyone else loving how silly the final boss looks?
Yeah
He needs more attacks.
Just skip godbot's attacks from now on, I guess.
lol Caramel got tired of seeing it
Its starting to get dull with the same cutscene over and over
Spitfire: about time tbh..
yush
Ded
hits me with a 15% hitrate
Well shit
Oh shit
good god
ded
Well
Now hes just skipping the animations
What now?
So much for her
GANLEON, AVENGE
Caramel: are you going to skip his death animation? :<
what? no
tenshin?
yay
I figured he'd miss with a 15% hitrate
Vengence!
just got really unlucky it seems
So is this like fire emblem and the character is gone for good?
GO GIANT WRENCH ATTACK!
SpadeMagnes[R]: no
SpadeMagnes[R]: it's just a credit penalty at the end of the stage
SpadeMagnes[R]: but the better the unit, the higher the penalty
skip
KING KITTAN!
So why does the king of the world have only one attack?
inb4 otakon is kicked
SpadeMagnes[R]: bc that's all he needs
BUFF TIME!
PLANET DANCE
I have no idea what is going on..
LYRA BUFF GO!
SpadeMagnes[R]: shits exploding yo
SpadeMagnes[R]: it's an ability that recovers a lot of health
SpadeMagnes[R]: for a lot of units
Do I see Turn A Gundam as well?
So why has the dude in the chair not killed anyone yet?
otakon: You do indeed.
yes you do
jesus
ouch!
Wait what the hell?
of course it hits rolo
SHIT!
Oh shit

rolololololo
Caramel: Rolo

Maybe he'll get lucky?

I might have forgotten to disable the support
Caramel: O_o

I think he would do better if he aimed.
Nope
Oh.. okay the stream is working for me now.
sorry folks
ohai RainbowDash90
looks like Rolo going bye bye
Who cares?
CrimsonPeewee: is that a joke?
D:
^^
Michael: Night fury is awesome
I will laugh if rolo survives
Caramel: At least it's canon :P
hi everpony what we watching
twilight_sprinkle, why would it be a joke
Rommulus ;)
Hiya LunerRepublicGuard
Again?
This shit again
ohai LunerRepublicGuard
LunerRepublicGuard: Hi!
Skiiip
Why you no use different moves
Caramel: get him OUT OF THERE!
hahaha
silly npc
LAWL
he missed with a 90% hitrate
Rommulus: bosses usually only have a few moves
Ahahahaha
LYRA, MOVE
some times the RNG can be cruel
DAWDGE MOTHERFUCKAS
Rolo you're a lucky bastard.
other times, hillarious
Caramel: LUCKY, also SUPER LOW ENERGY GET HIM AWAY!
Y U HAVE NO ORIGINALITY
Rolo is luckiest bastard
CrimsonPeewee: because who the fuck is egoraptor to take 1575 bucks for an autograph. i can get a Federer autograph on ebay for that much
why it no use different move that isnt that one XD
Hi everypony!
The game won't let Rolo die
00,10cause it knows
OtakuTom: Hi!
What the shit is this thing?
Super Dimensional Beast
basically bioweapon
is this gundam or code geass
He did not attack Ganleon.
SPANNER ATTACK GO!
00,10engi is pissed
LunerRepublicGuard: Both, at once, and then some.
LunerRepublicGuard: neither, lots of them
LunerRepublicGuard: Super Robot Wars

That hardly did anything
00,10erecten an ass kicking
Kittan to Simon's defense!

twilight_sprinkle, you don't really like Egoraptor?
Kittan!

Gnight everypony, HF with the stream :)
Caramel: is DAT the finall?

Michael: Night! :)
Kittan, taking one for the team. LIKE A MAN.

CrimsonPeewee: even if i did, no way in hell does some youtube guy deserve 1575 dollars for an autograph. its absurd
HAHAHAHAHA!
gotta love Wall
agreed

Kittan taking it like a champ.......again.
Kittan is a champ
DAMMIT!
WHY WON'T THAT WALL GO DOWN?
inb4 goddamit
AND he gets two attacks?
HAX
twilight_sprinkle, it's a drawing of anything, signed, mailed (not emailed) and all that for some center for horse
more than that
holy shit when did ganondorf get a rob ot
Lol dodged
good dodge
Suzaku gives zero fucks.
As much as I like Egoraptor, I have to agree with twilight_sprinkle.
true it is her mom working in there but still it's sort of nice
00,10odd, BerryPunch should have beaten wrek on that
Caramel: you're normal types are taking damage man, get them OUT of there
it's not all on his wallet
and the goddamn auction started at 0
HAX!
so if you have anyone to blame you blame the people not ego
Egoraptor may be a good writer/animator, but he's asking for a LOT of money he doesn't need.
CrimsonPeewee: like i said, i can get a ton of autographs of famous people with actual talent for that much...
AJIsAwesome: thats what the current bid is
Oh god He started at Zero
Flee rolo flee
and it's not for him
Behold the Internet

This is a PSP game, right?

LunerRepublicGuard: there was a boss in ff7:cc who had ??? hp and she took 20-40 minutes(depending on difficulty) to kill with maximum game damage
Meanwhile the god machine is sitting there biding his time
twilight_sprinkle: Mirando or something, right?
00,10dat lions over kill
This is as long as FF summons. XD
Reikim: no i dont think so, it was the secret goddess boss
OtakuTom: There's a cable that turns PSP screen into a standard video cable.
twilight_sprinkle: That's who I was referring to.
Lyra!
00,10orange time

Mr. Orange

00,10So loyal even death wont stop him
Sumica: huh? i thought RD was loyalty and AJ what honesty..
True facts from Sumi.
Sumica: I know. He was one of my favorite characters from that show.
twilight_sprinkle: not completely
Their elements are part of them, but they're not onetrack ponies

Less argument please
LunerRepublicGuard: wow lol. it was hard enough on easy
COMPLIES*
Let's just focus on the giant robots here.
/me can't type properly today
NomOmomomomom
What's going on in here? Just got back
I'm not into FiW. It may be funny to others and I can see why, but it's just not my cup of tea.
Hi CCCP :)
Vivix: Robots. Big ones.
Oh, that-anime?
00,10that dont look like the 303
Vivix: More like all of them :P
AJIsAwesome, yeah that's what I think I will feel if I see it- I'm..not sure it sounds like the thing I'd like
it's not unfortunately
go Holland!
Ooh
the 303 is only in Hakai Hen unfortunately
goddammit STILL 25K to do?
you used to be able to choose between the two
but for some reason they didn't let you in this
which made me had a sad
Caramel: don't you have any attacks that do 30K worth of damage? your losing units man!
/me turns on stream
Oshit
00,10oh dear
it's a boss with high armor, and is massive, which means it takes even less damage
bye Holland
Oh my god just DIE already.
there's no way I'm hitting him for 30k
and nah, holland is fine
Purple Tinker....left?
Caramel: wait when did Massive size impart damage resistance?
since...always?
Coincidence: Dovah, I'm listening to a song where the chorus sounds like it goes "dovah dovah dovah"
looking at this makes me wanna play that dragon rpg game on the PSOne
there's an ability you can buy to ignore that penalty
It always makes me think of you Dovah
Vivix: lol whats the name of the song?
Caramel: no really, I didn't know Massive guy got damage resistance, does tha go for your Battleship units too? they're usualy massive (LL) as well)
Dovah Battle by Blur
Shrugs off the lava
no, battleships don't get it
HAX
but they usually have their own special defenses
figures
They're final bosses, otakon. Can't really complain.
the chorus starts at around 1:20 Dovah
Vivix: and now i have a song to go listen to
hehe
Reikim: I bet you 1 MILLION bits it's not.
00,10spinzaku time
otakon: Final bosses plural. I already know there's more.
1:05*
anyway off to see if I missed a job application
He's in the red!
otakon: See ya
otakon: Bye! Good Luck! :)
4 digits left
Vivix: no no, I mean after he beats this stage there is gonna be another boss
Front.
Use the ultra ball now!
JUST DIE ALREADY!
USE BOSS BOROT!
why didnt we finish the code geass streams?
otakon, whatnow?
Petrified_Discord, lol.
00,10he still has the guy with the unbreakable wall
nvm
some people didn't like me streaming geass
<3
so I stopped, same goes for saint seiya and eureka 7
Caramel: What? WHy? :(
its a hit
Caramel: Why? I can't see.
00,10some people can sit on it and spin
yay!
Caramel: WHAT? HOW???
Caramel: I wonder why, it was more enjoyable then Eureka Seven.
Never seen either-
when are we going to watch more mlp episodes just asking
DJ_POn-3, probably this weekend
Vivix: I recommend you check out Code Geass more.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
oNE DOES NOT SIMLY DISLIKE CODE GEASS. i didnt intend that as caps but still
http://ts3.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4631147994154406&id=9f751b4efd47b63e6a693d924b9fd74e
alrighty
DJ_POn-3: Movie night, Friday, or Saturday morning if you want the Euro stream.
00,10did some one just ask for ponies?
argh Eureka Seven i know you like it Caramel but it had some of the most unlikable characters I've ever watched in an anime.
I've only seen Y of Geass- so know tiny parts of the story-
Sumica: no
then you have no taste
/me otakon clearly has not watched a lot of anime
Sumica: eenope
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
00,10Sure looked like a request for ponies
Honest! It was just someone asking for when <,<
No, no one requested for ponies!
voltron?
Nobody asking for ponies. Nope
Right, guys?
Right!
Yep
Right
I've really been meaning to watch Eureka 7. I didn't like Geass all too much.
Honestly though, why would we get complaints for Geass? I don't get it.
mfw Val is still streaming.
AJIsAwesome: Correct
yes we all requested Gen 3.6 pomies
Holy shit.
ponies*
Yep, no ponies here
Caramel: most of the character are assholes for no reason besides the sake of being assholes.
00,10this guy look like a OC mech
:D
Woah
LOL Sumi
otakon: then you aren't paying attention. Nothing more to say
I wonder what Mike's doin 8)
Is this a game?
Yes
/me so confused
yes
Sumica: I don't think it is. Looks like a Gundam to me.
YES! FINALLY HE'S DEAD!
Finally!
God is dead. And we have killed him.
Caramel: how am I not paying attention? Renton gets treated like absolute shit in the first 12 episodes
yay~
Sayonara, Baby
Mission Complete...almost
yaaaaay
00,10No I meen one of the SRW orignal mechs Reikim
for one, it's called hazing. Secondly, he over exaggerates how he's treated
Sumica: I know, and I think it's a Gundam.
what a royal pain
00,10they have there own mech's to fill out the rosters
aand ofc i missed his death
Wait
Infighting?
Reikim: That was Brasta, the main character
00,10not dead
Hazing? I probably wouldn't like it either-
Caramel: Ah, okay. Nvm then.
PUNS R fun :)
Probably intentionally looks like a Gundam, really.
Caramel: are they fighting eachother?
I might check ou Geass- but I rarely watch any anime
Caramel: hazing is still a horrible damn practice.
last time is ..5 years ago? other than stream
Wait, why is he attacking Akuma?
Drop dead already!
wait
Spitfire: No, he's forcing Gaioh to reveal his full power
waht?!
Vivix: code geass is best anime
Caramel: oh
That wasn't even...his final form?
big bad fighting OTHER big bad?
Or actually I did see Deathnote on TV, otehr than that -yeah
Reikim: Nope. :D
Reikim: Of couse not
Reikim: eeyup that's what I was trying to tell you.
twilight_sprinkle, so they say- hm

00,10bad guy just boom head shot other bad guy
Would be funny if the game just ended here.
betrayel
I'm sure this cutscene is freaking epic for people who can read Japanese.
Vivix: altho if you just like action, you might not like it. it has good action, but a lot of story and character focus too
00,10damn he had another guy
He summoned Lyra! :O
LYRA?
perfect timing
perfect lyra timing
King of the World 1HKO'd the more obvious big bad. But not for good.
...Well that's ugly.
A WILD LYRA HAS APPEARED
TASTE THE RAINBOW
:O
FINAL BOSS LYRA?
Universe attack!
Ded
SON OF A BITCH
00,10it's the rainbow of Darkness

It's an anti-rainbow

Caramel: im lost .-.
So he fused with the core?
Dat text skip
00,10he missed
FINAL SCRET BOSS: MICHAEL BAY
Wait...what are these options?
Oh
now I just realized
basically
this is the game that never ends
if you choose to accept what he's saying
he becomes level 99
Did you?
lol @ lyra
eeyup
BRB
<.<
But everyone else is lvl 99.
Here¬¥s what happened: Final Form
Caramel: And if you don't accept?
then he's at his regular level 70
Caramel: is DAT the final?
yes, it is
:O
00,10dem buff bots
epic moment
s-force, unite!
Caramel: dat kewl, you kewl
Caramel: What's the benefit of fighting him on level 99?
ANIME
00,10time for some 00 Riser
nothing, it's just harder :P
Sumica: http://cheezburger.com/6531888384
You are one strange pony
Oookay, so somewhere in there, Mylene and Veffidas get their own Valkyries, and they all get to combine with Basara's VF-19?
so wait, he has to redo the whole battle now??
back
lol i just bit my lip again fml
or did he load game
neither
wth just happened
He just has to beat up the newly-summoned mooks.
Tarzan... The last time I saw this was the first time .w.
00,10lockonv2
i don't see death scyth why?
Reikim: well that seems rather pointless..
cause I didn't want it
Sumi's having fun identifying all the different robots.
Is that a rainbow colored godzilla ciborg?
00,10yep
00,10but I dont know the realy old one
Mazinger?
I remember falling asleep in theback of the car at the drive in x3
The weird blue one confounds me.
i see a seapony lyra :D
Who's this one?
The one riding a dragon.
I swear, 90% of the time I watch this, he's fighting mooks. If not mooks, he's fighting just those two specific enemies.
caramel = valthejean?
00,10Getterrobo I presume
Psicologists are stupid douchebags..........
LyraTheMedic eeyup
LYRA WHY YOU NO HELP IN BATTLE TO SAVE THE WORLD?
LyraTheMedic: Yes.
there we go :3
Then I think it was a gunshot in the movie that woke me ouo
00,10no clue
anyone, can someone ping me once we get to the death of the bad guy?
Hey Caramel, is the GaoGaiGar in this one?
he was in a previous game, not this one
twilight_sprinkle
Damn
cachi01|phone: is that a yes? :P
haha
cachi01|phone: Don't be a troll. :D

Lol
I also miss Gunbuster, unfortunately.
Is that
well anyway someone ping me plz once we get there
I have to watch Getter Robo now.

Awwww baby Tarzan X3
Yup, this has been decided. I am watching Getter Robo.

the weird goo thi9ng again
is that flan...?
What the heck IS that thing! It's too organic to be a machine!
pudding?
00,10death by gigapudding
why is there a giant flan monster?
Until it can be positively identified, it's just a killer MMMM.
No! Yoko!
Lyncast: Anime
Giant killer MMMM
Reikim: dont worry, her boobies will protect her
I told you all: It¬¥s a rainbow colored godzilla ciborg
Why ISNT there a giant flan monster?
I turn away for just a brief moment, then I turn back and find Yoko...I have no problems with that...lol
SpadeMagnes[R], well, this is Super ROBOT Wars. Not Super big giant stuff that's usually but not always a Robot Wars
lyra, get out of that fireball, its not for seaponys
Seapony Lyra: soon....
Who's this guy?
00,10gundamn wing, but been to long to recall the mech
Shenlong Gundam
It's some version of Shenlong
how many dragon thingys are there?
Someday I'll get around to watching Gundam. Then I'll be able to name all the mechs.
Lyra`: Two left
00,10mech with dreadlocks, seems legit
thats too many, just saying.
:)
Overman King Gainer.
Reikim, there are a lot of series. And a lot of them are alternate universes.
dont you insult King Gainer!
00,10good luck Reikim
did I see gundam epyon?
00,10they have alot of gundamns
"Shibaru is in a tragedy shoujo manga. " Yup. definitely
We're not, Caramel. We're complimenting its awesomeness.
so this is multiverse gundam extravaganza? kind of like the episode of pwower rangers where it was a teamm full of red rangers?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9qx61qEC81qaplb5o1_500.png
I want to rewatch Wing and then finally catch SEED and 00. I guess I should try to find the DVDs for those fast, since Bandai is stopping their distribution.
00,10ewww seed
The first series I watched was the English dub of Gundam Wing. I totally didn't know it was an AU series.
What was wrong with Seed?
what we watchin
00,10it's a soapopra with mechs
/me has never seen most of the gundams
I think...
00,10every one is in a contest to try and out emo the last guy
The only Gundam I've ever completely seen was Zeta, and only because it came in movie form.
"Cades is in a harem yaoi manga. " Oh my.
Even then, four hours.
Lyra So is the Dynasty Warriors Gundam games. They're even more multiverse than this game
6o.o
O_O
oof
Lyra`, that analogy only fits if you include Kamen Rider, Metal Heroes, and a whole bunch of other Tokustatsu series that also have nothing to do with Super Sentai in this.
dynasty wars :(
Oooh...I just remembered 08th MS Team...that was another one of my favorites.
JESmith71, if it has Gundam in the name, it's probably less multiverse than this.
I'm still looking for a good copy of Char's Counterattack, simply because Nu Gundam was awesome in Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2.
Poop
00,10the icon for the blackknights flag ship always cracks me up
00,10it looks like a fish wearing a pirate hat
>_>
Great, thanks Sumi, now I can't unsee that.
liarjack
i'm back
Sumica, I believe it's the Ikaruga
I see...HOLY SHIT
/me sets a tonberry inside otakon s internet
Space Godzilla on STEROIDS
00,10woooo 000riser
6Hmm..I must say,I always forget what doujinshi is.. >.<
friendship cannon?
6Heya ^^
dammit why couldn't he blow up the pretty boy?
trans-am?
I like th taste of seed
Sumica: Hey, if I were to pick a Gundam to start with, which would be the best? And shortest.
does he have a 6 cyclinder engine?
otakon: cause animes and their pretty boys
If you kno what I mean...
And you're in one too.... -sigh-
Reikim: 08th MS Team is a good one
6xD
uh oh, Universe bots turn
00,10he has two drives otakon
CCCP, you should come over some time :3
CCCP: What.
i just made apple seed jelly :3
00,10i like 00 gundam
hiya Lyra` oh that rhytmed
00,10but it's 52 eps
otakon: they are making an easy mode for dark souls. thoughts?
Ah
Yea, 08th MS team is a good one to start out with. It's only 12 or 13 episodes.
Sumica: what's the one where basically ...well nuclearweapons gundam
OOOOtakon <3
Bronysith: it doesn't need it
Lyra lol
final final boss
00,10ms08 is good
The last 52-ep anime I watched was Soul Eater. Haven't been able to since then.
how do i register this name?
Bronysith: if only they got rid of the cheapness that is the anor londo archer
00,10ot taht sounds like wing
Twilight_sprinkle nothing.... ;)
otakon: the director is doing it for better sales
6xDD
Just came here to say I hate Howard Stern. First, he says all bronies are cloppers, and THEN, he goes and makes a kid cry on national TV. WTF, man?!
Bronysith: FOR SHAME
/
otakon: false
ShadowQuill: shock value
Caramel: well I SAID IIRC
Who next? XD
how long has he been on that mission?
Rainbow Godbot is...kind of corny.
ShadowQuill: He
otakon: cause the "difficulty intimidates and makes people not want to play the game"
and obviously I was rwong
ShadowQuill: He's a joke. Don't even listen to him.
?
6HA!
Bronysith: the ONLY game I won't play bc of difficulty is SMB
otakon: thats the point, WEED OUT CASUALS
SEND IN GANLEON
6*dances*
SEND IN GL!
SEND IN BIG O!
Lyra damn iPad won't let me type the end of your name or tab it

whatever that means
00,10but yeah the 00 has a sword so bit it hit a ship in orbit with it
00,10from the surface
Sumica: Is this a thing that happened in the series? Like, actually happened?
6Shonen is a mixture of most genres,isn't it?
this mission is beyond overboard
like seriously
00,10what the game here?
idk
00,10nah
Sumica: Did the 00 actually hit a ship in orbit in the anime?
00,10yes
...
is there a secret boss?
time to make reikim happy
dammit Space Godzilla is STILL nto dead
YES!
00,10with a beamsword
AW SHIT
That series just went up several notches on my to watch list.
YES!
AH YEAH

AAAAAAH
YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAH
GIGA
DRILL
GIGA

HISSATSU!!!!!!!!!!!!

GIGA!
00,10the guys on the ship comment how they missed with the beam attack
BREAKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUh
BREEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR
DRILL!
DRILL
6Shonen is a mixture of most genres,isn't it?
BREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
00,10to which they respon it's not a beam shot.
and Lyra pops up at the PERFECT moment
thank you Seapony Lyra
youre welcome babe
00,10I might have to rewatch it now
Hmmm... I guess 8)
Sumica: So much badass. That's going...second on my to watch list now.
<.<
is this music or something?
6Has a bit of action,adventure,comedy,drama and shizzle.. or something :P
6Manga :P
or books
ah ok
oh look
00,10this is another one from 00
It's mostly action and fantasy i think xD
it's the GunCannon revision
and it does shit for damage.
it sucks
6*sigh* Brb..I need to drag myself to my room to get my earphones... ._.
and lyra <3
Lyra`: it's a opener and every little bit helps
lol
welp he's dead
Lyra`: This is the final boss we're talking about here. Everything is going to do shit for damage.
...
ouch
00,10that was't a power attack
damn
one more hit like that and he's toast
00,10did't even go trans-am
47% chance lockon dies
let's see if the RNG likes me
"Mike is in a psychological shounen manga. " Accurate.
Caramel: he's so dead
i remember this one
RNG in these situations have fucked me over so MANY times
Why is this guy build like a brick shithouse?
00,10it's ok we have a spare lockon
What
6Ok,torture is over. :D
Me: 90% chance to hit
lol sumica, this IS the spare :P
>misses
00,10lolwoops
and he lives!
Enemy: 10% chance to hit
he so ded
>hits
so MANY times
Aaaand Lockon lives.
Nope
Hey he lives
Hmmm... who next....
GODDAMN LUCKY BASTARD
00,10gigapuddie
elements of harmony are pretty inaccurate
I hate games that dont tell me how close to death a boss is
6dari?
Caramel: you need to pull back your wounded units man
and Gigapuddie is back
okay the HELL is that thing?
It gets annoying
seriously
the FUCK was that thing?
Gigapiddi!! :D
otakon: you need to not tell me how to play my game man
:D
Caramel: just a suggestion
caramel, make them hug and make up :3
if only Lyra`
MAZINGER!
:D
6That sounds kinda weird..
SpadeMagnes[R]: We can infer based on how much of the bar he loses for the damage he takes. I'm guessing right now, 400 000 to 500 000 health.
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oo2xr/
6Meh,you know what I mean..
ok haha, idk what ur talking about, just ignore me :P
Mazinger Z!
The story would probably be more engaging if anyof us understood japanese
SpadeMagnes[R]: agreed
wtf is that thing?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Definitely.
I'm really not keeping up sorry, am working on homework
Shit
it is hideous
6xD
Revising estimates
6:O
Lyra`: A giant super robot that transforms itself into a giant fist to do damage
Lol
Looks like something around 1 000 000 HP.
The game looks fun but it seems bland without understanding the dialouge
I was thinking something around 1 million hp
Got distracted by tumblr
If only they released an English patch like they did with Mother 3.
ded
SpadeMagnes[R], definitely, but that means that Caramel would have to take a lot longer whenever the dialog pops up
Yea I guess
Caramel is still kicking ass? :D
TUMBLR'S ALWAYS DISTRACTING ME!!!
imma throw the univers at that bitch
Teleport rush!
*universe
AJIsAwesome, are you aware of how much trouble that patch took to make?
ded>

6Do you have an account there? :3
Gotta love Wall.

LOL
Wal FTW
Kandarihu: I know. It took YEARS to make. I'm just suggesting.

*Wall
Yea
Kandarihu: Besides, it was just a joke.
Well there goes your batteries

Woah

Caramel: oh no! don't tell me you lost ALL that progress again
:|
Caramel: How far back

um
00,10and then the psp learned how to fly
Caramel: doesn't it have in battle saves?
*Spike* NOOOOOOOO!!
Well. Shit.
lol Sumica
it does, but you have to quit out of it to do so
Sweetie Belle: OH COME ON!
Caramel: dammit
Now we have to do that all over
OR
Caramel: that truly TRULY sucks man, this will be the THIRD time you'll have to fight that boss again
we can watch him play warioparty
Hmm, WAITING, it says in the lower right hand corner
Yes
Caramel: /)
YES
:)
Caramel: maybe just get to the final hit of the final boss and quit/save and show us on stream?
Is this a physical PSP or an emulator he's got?
PSP
Kandarihu: Real thing.
hell i should get a PSP emulator
*crys 4 my PSP* so many memories
Caramel: How far are you?
I really REALLY want to try out Persona 1 and 2

she got kicked
huh
oh and dat music

Lyra`: I thought you got kicked
he destroyed towns for shits and giggles
The only thing that annoys me about Duodecim is that the removed the ability to break combos with EX mode.
did i?
they should have put Sora in this for shits and giggles
also its funny how sephiroths moves are worse in hard mode
my computer has been acting weird
otakon: What has Lyra` been doing? I haven't been paying attention.
Lyra`: maybe, the client likes to kick for colors and underlines
00,10Gonna see if I can get 00 gundam in english for stream
AJIsAwesome: nothing
AAAAAAAAW SHIT
oh god
Ouch
otakon: Oh, okay.
Sumica: i love you
yeah, didnt mean too, my computer is pushing weird buttons
Sumica: If you do find a decent place...PM me?
well, sure, but nobody actually died from it, well except the emperor and the children's parents
/me puts a slug in Sumica s ear

why wait is sephiroths voice female?....
*wait why
Sumica: PM?
I can't tell what the numbers are for
00,10same place i get all my anime

The numbers mason

/me slaps SpadeMagnes[R]
yeah get EX up in here!
00,10Nyaa.eu
SpadeMagnes[R]: thats a reference to a bad game and you should feel bad
Bronysith: hmmm good question. My favorite is Steiner tbh but "best" hero overall has to be Terra for sure
...Huh, I've been here before.
i may have never played any final fantasy, but are those kefka and sephiroth fighting?
desertman2: basically the numbers mean how much damage your attack will do. there are attacks that lower those numbers or that do direct damage
*literal dance*
YOU'LL BE WELL DONE
The english dub is also available through Crunchyroll
Buytoast ja
Buytoast: Yep.
what kind of ass pandering game is this?
How is Dissidia? Is it good?
ah man
thanks, I don't have a PSP, so I was never able to play this
11,01Pouring down outside.
desertman2: desertman2: if your opponent knocks those numbers belows zero he gets a bonus
Buytoast Squeenix answer to a fighting game
Nittany_Discord: Hope it lets up soon.
...somehow
You join a PF2 server and the nas so as you get out on the battlefeild and nopony is fighting insted they are making a giant tower outta each other :P
/me 6refuses to stand up if it is not necessary.
twilight_sprinkle: Not where I am. Scorching hot here. :|
Nittany_Discord: unfortunately the rain here was lame and only lasted 30 minutes <.<
Kefka " Life...Dreams...Hope...Where do they come from? And where do they go? None of that junk is enough to fulfill your hearts! Destruction...Destruction is what makes life worth living! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Let's destroy everything!"

Yay for Mike replying
AJIsAwesome: sucks
^-^
6^^
AJIsAwesome i LOVE it its pretty fun plus a couple old school costumes *Classic Red FF1 WoL,Freelancer Bartz,After Years Golbez,etc.*
This doesnt seem to be going anywhere
DJ_POn-3 ah, kinda neat
SpadeMagnes[R]: i actually think caramel is screwing around
SpadeMagnes[R], watch the purple meter
DJ_POn-3: That's very good. :D
I know what he wants to do
DJ_POn-3: I meant :O
Dken2021: im not a pro
but it'll take time
DJ_POn-3: Stupid emotes. :|
6Kimi wa kimi dake shika inai yo..... ‚ô™
6BWAHA
AJIsAwesome: ya ikr
from what i saw in the demo and from watching now, sephiroth seems terrible underpowered in this game
Ohai Nittany_Discord
DJ_POn-3 still somewhat better than me
dat HP
Sumica: How do you tell what kind of translation they've got?
So BREAK is when you can deal direct damage right?
Dken2021:what did ypu make :)
otakon: why must sephiroths blade BE 7 FUCKING FEET LONG?!
AJIsAwesome: no break is when your attack numbers go below zero
*you
11,01Yes Ponies47?
AJIsAwesome: your opponent gets a bonus for that
Has anypony played Slender?
its going to suck if sephiroth gets EX
Nittany_Discord: I said hi :P
11,01Hi.
Fluttershy6194: yes
So how do you deal direct damage?
is this the first or second disidia game?
Nittany_Discord: hi aniki i am back from dragoncon
soon
second
Nittany_Discord!, im ban evading, get me :3
im a bad girl :3
kefka is op
Is Slender a scary game?
twilight_sprinkle: Yep. :D
Nittany_Discord: ogod why https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/644654_4660472676291_1130321691_n.jpg
and sephiroth is so underpowered...
Nittany_Discord: how are you and welcome
Fluttershy6194: It's more shock than scary. Plus there's no point to it.
Nittany_Discord, babe, dont ignore me, i thought we had something special :(
Fluttershy6194: not if you play it at day time with happy music.
:)
AJIsAwesome well there are 2 attacks ya can do. Bravery *Circle* takes numbers off the enemy's Brave *Numbers on top of health* and Direct *Square* does the amount in Brave *4421=4421 damage to HP*
lol does sephiroth have 1hp
>1
break is when they cant do shit to you
damn
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Okay. Thanks. :)
twilight_sprinkle: he has last chance
boy this fight is dragging out longer than a search for a missing white child from a wealthy influential family
Who's Val fighting against/as?
twilight_sprinkle: and as long as you have brave points you don't take health damage
otakon: why did they make sephiroth so weak in this game <.<
otakon: i know the system
VICTORY FOR THE BEST VILLAIN
;)
you know
Reikim: fighting Sephiroth as Kefka
Kuja is best villain
Ah
Kefka = the Joker of Final Fantasy
twilight_sprinkle: so weak?
is this Dysidia 1 or 2?
2
012
ah
damn
AJIsAwesome no prob :$ kinda played this alot before trading in my psp,man i need to get it on psn for my vita now! :D
My personal favourite to play as is Tifa in her AC costume. SO much badass.
hiya Rain how are ya?
otakon: yeah.
dat Rain :3
Rain <3
allo Rain
PLAY GILGAMESH
ello Rain
Also fun: Tidus. Little bastard is fast and overpowered.
Squall?
why
...whatever
Because Squall is awesome.
because Squall is a fucking badass
why not?
leon
Reikim, I disagree
Squall was also completely broken in the first game.
Hello everyone, I see its Dissidia time :3
Reikim, Rain ...whatever
hai oni_link
umm what?
my best character in Dysidia
Hi there oni_link
Hey oni_link!
squall... is badass?
Reikim: NO SPOILERS
what?
how does a gunblade even function?
I JUST STARTED 8 NO SPOILERS PLEASE
CrimsonPeewee: I only say that because in the first game he had infinite Beat Fang combos. I defeated soooo many bosses that way.
hai Dken2021 and Rommulus
/me hugs Ponies47
hi!
Bronysith: THE MAIN HERO DIES
9Thx for following backk ^^
:o
Reikim, ...whatever
oni_link: Hi! :)
was that
ah, the big bad of the first game
9*back*
"Spyro is in a drama shoujo manga." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA
THAT VOICE
9o.o
lol dat Goliath
hey AJIsAwesome! :)
it WAS
otakon: ...I'm pretty sure it was.
IT IS
HOLY SHIT
X3
Chaos is a decent villian tbh
/me Hugs oni_link back "You are not going to believe what I found while playing MvM yesterday!"
Zidan is also a fun character to play as
I did NOT expect him to voice Chaos
I would like Warrior of Light more
otakon: why are gunblades awesome?
lol otakon you silly when ya fangasm :D
Bronysith: bc they're cool looking
/me 4is bored.
CrimsonPeewee, I think dissidia needs more Black Belt :)
Ponies47: hehe I probably wont until I see it. what is it??
otakon, who's voicing Chaos?
Bronysith becasue they have a confusing concept
Does anyone know of a psp emulator?
i was like that too the first time i play this :$
I so want to play these games...
oni_link: I found the high five taunt! :3
why are you doing bravery attacks when you are in break?
The weird ass is bored
they do nothing and an HP attack gets you out of break
Ponies47: wow, for reals?? :o
CrimsonPeewee: I forget the guy's name, but he's Captain Anderson from Mass Effect.
damn
man i hate divine punishment and soul of oblivion
woah
oh....mass effect
oni_link: For reals :3
...whatevr
it's...dammit WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER HIS NAME?
Keith David?
round 2, FIGHT
yes
otakon: Who?
Keith David
also LAG
Chaos a furry now?
is that keith david voice?
Ponies47: Im so jelly D:
yes it is
Fun fact: Cecil is played by...someone.
oh not yet
I forgot who.
:O
DAMMIT.
oni_link: You can high five me the next time we play. :3
Reikim, imdb
lol everytime he does that kick it sounds like he's sayin "BULL SHI-!" :D
Cecil is Yuri Lowenthal
get sum
keith david in a japanese game :O
YURI LOWENTHAL
Ponies47: awesome! :) I was really tempted to buy that taunt XD
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0523180/
That was who.
man i LOVE this song!
Hello there. ^^
Chaos is a wierd villian in that he is more of a powerful summon more than anythiing
XD
Cecil is Prince of Persia
Shit just got confusing
xD
:o
Chaos wasn't even that hard of a final boss in the first game
oni_link: I couldn't believe you can find that taunt. But I guess you can. It's just all luck.
imagine if G4 and G1 had to team Dissidia style to fight Chaos o_0
Dken2021: well in the absolute ORIGINAL version he was
You should see how confusing it had gotten a while back..we had all changed our names and were impersonating whatever we could think of..
Sketch_Toku_Brony, you mean Discord?
bc of limited healing items/magic/cure all of his HP bull
haha
In Dissidia, Chaos is a goddamn asshole.
Sec,I'll send the screenies :P
k
CrimsonPeewee lol no i mean THIS Chaos
Ponies47: I think I wanna buy it XD that was soooo lucky though!
otakon: and the giant dungeon you had to go through before him
Sketch_Toku_Brony, horrible crossover
well duh, that game was pretty much unplaytested and had stats that didn't; work
oni_link: IKR? :p
NullRadix: and the random boss battles
think of it like this
Limit Break!
oh no, boss battles weren't random
dat timing
huh uhh huh uhhh huh uhhh
Chaos ... = Discord :)
Val, if you had the first one, we could play over Adhoc (assuming you also have a ps3)
woot got my graduation certificate in the mail
CrimsonPeewee yeah Discord and maybe that G1 guy would be neat to fight?
there were specific tiles on the floor that had the boss battles
everytime I look at this game, I think of Sanity Not Included :D
Tirak I believe
I have no idea whats going on stream
yeah i think so
Ponies47: yeah, I tried making a new weapon and it wasnt worth it
11Idk why,but my current nickname amuses me.
he's not so much out to distroy anythiing per se, it is just out to spread... Chaos.. .and Discord :)
I lost sandvich
oni_link: Oh dear :S
oni_link, that's simple you only saw sample of this game in that webshow
oh my
oh Shit
man Feral Chaos was CRAZY in Scenario 00
dat's a BIGGUN
otakon: NOT BIG ENOUGH
euh euh euh
oh god
Ponies47: its alright though, Ill come across one again soon. And I dont use it that much anyways :P
oh shit
lol ak47 is not known as ak47 with silencer XD
13rain rain~<3
now*
/me 13pounces rain~
lol that was lame
Shizuka: I found a picture of you!
oni_link: I do :P
/me snuggles with Shizuka <3
11That was me :P
Ohai Shizuka!
hax
shizu shizu.....oh
Hey, Shizu\
ohai Shizuka, Rain
again?
CrimsonPeewee: Yeah I wanna play this so bad. I dont have a psp though.
awesome :P
well at least Discord doesnt turn into something like THAT 0_o
11:P ^^
....yet
Sketch_Toku_Brony, he could though
:p
13otakon: nuh uh
dat lyra
yeah and then it gets all Pony Laggan! :D
otakon: link it
I remember it took me AGES to figure out how to avoid all of Chaos' attacks.
http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/109/109993.jpg Shizuka uh huh!
and here comes the kill shot
damn that hurt
13well
Ponies47: I do if im playing by myself but i can do without it. I never got around to asking you what the specs for your desktop were now that I remembered.
Firaja?
more like Flare
13it's a close resemblance
"Penis is in a gender bender josei manga. " PENIS IS NOW KNOWN AS VAGINA
all these characters make think why in hell is sephiroth so much weaker than all of them
which was the big non-elemental kill spell before Ultima and Meteor showed up
I dunno lol
See, this is why you need a character like Warrior of Light with his brave-to-HP combos.
twilight_sprinkle: bc he's a clone/virus mix with pearly white hair?
woah, mindfuck O_o
twilight_sprinkle, because he never did anything for himself
lol
dammit again?
otakon: I remember flare! I saw it in FFX
DODGE!
otakon: but hes an awesome clone/virus with pearly hair >:I
11xDDD gender bend failsus!
I love this attack
So much fun
twilight_sprinkle: -___-
Nope, val..
ouch
twilight_sprinkle, there are way more better villains than sephiroth
You rolled into the attack
so is he almot dead yet?
Shizuka: also I saw another charcter with that name..in Queen's Blade. She's an oni...
sephiroth just got insane and obsess with his mother
/me shivers
he's a mommyboy
13shizuka ist not an uncommon name silly filly
/me 11is bored.
what game is this?
Finally
/me when queen's blade is mentioned
oni_link: 2.60 GB processer, 1 terabit of memory (Also have a external hard drive to gimme extra 500 GB) and 6 gigabit's of ram :3
CrimsonPeewee: maybe, but he was one of the first ones with a story like his. and hes still awesome. hes certainly better than any other character in ff7
otakon: ...You watched Queen's Blade.
Reikim: on impulse
DISCORD
Discord's dream hell yeya
Reikim: for the hell of it
Golbez had something
Discord
wut :I
Okay otakon
Discord's Hopes?
Kefka had a story
can ya fight Feral Chaos Caramel?
i love queens blade
And why did you KEEP watching, otakon?
he took discords dreams and hopes...
Must be a Chocolate Milk of Glass
queen's blade... the memories :)
Ponies47: is it a Intel or AMD processor? and what about the Graphics? also, thats pretty good :P
I love seapony Lyra.
Reikim: no I stopped just before the opening ended actually
watching queen's blade on inpulse wha?
/me has intel graphics
Sure, otakon.
I did
AW SHIT
That's why you know about some character named SHizuka.
LET'S JUMP
ney guy
SURE.
I haven't watched an entire episode yet
I learned from the horror of Eiken club
so what game is this?
/me continues to be disbelieving.
THE HORROR
im back, i miss anything... magic
so much blantant fanservice can ruin it for a guy
Rustymeat some kind of fighting game fro msquare enix
its okay
oh yeah! Kain's VA also voices War in Darksiders. ah memories
jump jump jump jump
Reikim: seriously i haven't watched more than 30 seconds of it
otakon: in what? are we talking anime? i want in
Mm-hm.
/me hugs oni_link
*need to see 2nd season queens blade*
funny how vita has no awesome games like this
cratorkid: Queen's Blade, very fanservice heavy anime.
Ha!
^
it's on Crackle but their service sucks
otakon: heards about it , its f'ing hentai
Reikim: what?
intel graphics can handle games quite well :I
QB isn't fanservice-heavy. It's fanservice INCARNATE.
I haventt been compelled to buy a Vita. I have a 3DS and that just collects dust too..
cratorkid: actually no it's not, not a single sex scene
twilight_sprinkle :( its gonna have sly cooper... :$
cratorkid: at most it's ecchi bc just boobs and butts
otakon: How do you know?
oni_link, I play my ambassador GBA games right now :3c
Reikim: bc it's not listed as hentai IIRC
otakon: crackle sucks because of the ADs
LunerRepublicGuard: it sucks bc it won't load
otakon: like kiss x sis , it might as well be
and also play Theathrythm cause I'm a suck-up on rhythm games
Yea, Queen's Blade isn't hentai as much as it is ecchi
otakon: that sh*t was weird
AND Final Fantasy has gorgeous music
ah, we have Final fantasy's batman
I don't know it
CrimsonPeewee: I lost my GBA and all I have is Sapphire :/ I miss it
11Yeah,quite a few :P
Dken2021: Kain?
ya
CrimsonPeewee: Nobuo Uematsu. Wins.
oh this character
hes cool
and then he was Sean Connery?
NICE MUSIC
and le awesome musics
Noduo Uematsu...oh that's the guy that compose FF music
He sounds like Sean Connery
is that Cecil?
i wish i hadnt broken my psp <.<
you shud get em to come back here
this stage....
I hate it so much
Oh hey
CrimsonPeewee: Nobuo Uematsu and he left with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Akira Toriyam to make Mistwalker studios
twilight_sprinkle: same here
Chaos is now a furry
4Sec,let me see if any are on msn..
oh
CrimsonPeewee: you haven't seen Freya Cresent have you?
jump is now an attack
I never could master Cecil.
Come on Jump
one of the few stages sephirorh is actually dangerous...
otakon, Freya wha?
^
4I'd check fb but I can't be seen online at this hour,especially since I'm supposed to be exhausted.
otakon: Actually, Uematsu's doing his own thing, though he's working heavily with Sakaguchi.
Sephiroth is over rated
CrimsonPeewee: FFIX, Freya Crescent was a Dragoon in it.
what SpadeMagnes[R] said
MIMIC. god I love that one~
oooooh
The WORST stage in Dissidia, though, has to be Planet's Core. TOO DAMN SMALL.
I like my Kain more though
4There's no one on..
Jesus
JUMP KAIN JUMP
wooo
yes yes, i know hating sephiroth is popular nowadays. i think ill avoid the bandwagon thankyouverymuch
you didn't....jump
;-;
/me laptop cant handle minesweeper >_>
He jumped a lot of time
yikes
Feral Chaos' EX is CRAZY
Kain would totally be a pegasus
Caramel: Play as Tifa.
I remember that they made the weapon master nut suck as much in this one
gaara y u in ff?
Oh shit
gaara was kewl
lolwat matchup
not*
TERRA <#
I wanna see how fast Tidus can be :3
Doesnt this game pull a dick move in the tutorial that makes you fight Feral Chaos?
terra <3
blood with a hint of leamon is good :)
SpadeMagnes[R]: If you claim you're confident.
Bronysith, calm your fan-gasm down a lil bit
aw :( ok
terras super mode is being nude :D
I love me some Terra :3
Thats sych a asshole move though
CrimsonPeewee: NEVAH
oni_link: Intel and HD 6530D graphics (I hope I got that right :S)
twilight_sprinkle, furry nude?
Um
or is that Zidane only?
who doesn't love tera, especially that esper forme?
What happened
wut
what
wat?
Blast
lolwat

I think this is the part where I fell asleep XD
Haax! She dodged out of Tornado! That's impossible!
FFFFFFUUUUUUUU

or maybe shes saying hear
4D:
Ponies47: do you know how much Video memory that thing has?
or maybe heir
you know of ALL the characters in the FF series
Bear

they could have had WAY more character
leer
beer
or at least more skins
fear
snear
gear
queer
oni_link: I forget ;_;
peer
otakon: DLC. Also, making movesets is difficult, see Fighting is Magic.
Is this the first game or the sequel?
beer
why is power girl fighting alextraza?
tear
FFIV is best FF cause you could visit Luna
For some reason I thought this was one of those 3D Touhou fighters.
Buytoast: cause terra is best final fantasy hero
Ponies47: aw its alright, have you messed around with your resolution on TF2 though?
I will still maintain that FF5 is my favourite.
WindWhistler, there's no 3d Touhou fighter
otakon irk? i wanted at least Auron or even Wedge and Biggs *as joke characters* i mean even Zell from FF8
CrimsonPeewee: Yeah. They're just fangames though.
Reikim, interesting choice
CrimsonPeewee: Actually...there is.
not official
Well, yeah
VI has been my favorite ever since the first time I played it.
CrimsonPeewee: I just love it. Especially the system.
I still need to play the older 8 and 16 bit games...
11DEAR GOT
11FAIL
oni_link: Nope. Works just fine :P
Well anyways I'm gonna go practice my cello.
11*DEAR GOD
Some one die allready
meh
rawr
takes WAY too long
oh, is there an actual 3d touhou fighting game? cause if so, the fans are very dedicated
darkness of gravity
This dissidia?
sphere
Barbetos: indeed
Ponies47: thats awesome :) how much did you end up spending?
4ROAR ZABIMARU
Hah. Thats funny. I have NEVER seen this game ever.
Just a few pics
for now Touhou is still vastly dedicated to their thing then Brony
i played the demo
brigadier
vastly more
The music gives it away
twas lotsa fun. minus sephiroth being weak as hell
oni_link: About $500 (Thing was on sale)
yeah EX~!
/me hums Lavender Town music to give everyone nightmares
also i hated garland
dat lyra
twilight_sprinkle: Sephiroth gets deadly if you give him the right moves. Same with Garland.
Ponies47: oh cool. I still have to wait awhile longer to get mine
twilight_sprinkle, dem blocks?
oni_link: Awww. :<
maybe like next month
the Lavender Town music gives Freddy Kruger nightmares
Reikim: well garland is very strong. but sephiroth? i dont see how, his bravery attacks are so weak compared to others, and on hard he doesnt even have his aoe
Sigh
13WAZZUP DUUUUDES!?
Ponies47: its alright though, by then Ill have it and then I can sell this laptop too.
zzzzz
oni_link: Yay! :3
ultima is fun move
Esper!
twilight_sprinkle: That's the thing. You're playing with premade movesets. In the full game you can control what moves he gets. He's fast and has quite good range, with the right moveset.
nude mode!
YEAH
twilight_sprinkle: You also get equips that increase power and so on.
YES
THAT FINISH
finally
at the last second
Reikim: ah, well maybe.i only played the demo. unfortunately my psp broke so thats that :(
Ponies47: I know, its gonna be awesome! Ill finally be able to run Skyrim and all my other games XD
Man, you guys like your furries.
Some of these fights go on for way too fucking long
This girl is best Zora
Reikim half furry to be exact
oni_link: SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
heeeh she looks more like a plant girl than anything
oi Caramel play as sephiroth
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, the full game is much better. Although I, too, logged dozens of hours in the demo :)
spade: I haven't played in months, give me a break...jesus
uhh guys, i turned on my computer and theres a bunch of colors and shit all over the screen
some sort of final fantasy fighting game?
Reikim, I am a furry
Oh its Terra?
Sorry Caramel
Took me a second
Caramel: Tifa please?
hai Athgaar, ya
yaaay
I want Gilgamesh
i am a furry reikim
Reikim: "logged"?
trying to take a pic of it but my phones being retarded
Gilgamesh please
ha
wat a match up
oh come one
7:O
Ponies47: haha I know! I cant wait. MvM lags bad when I have alotta of enemies on screen
wouldve been funnier if it were sephiroth vs aerith
twilight_sprinkle: Played. It's an affectation. The game logs your hours. Thus, I have "logged" x number of hours on a game.
twilight_sprinkle: I see what you did there XD
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4569/
Reikim: ah k. loved the demo, wish i had the chance to play the ful lversion, looks super
level 100 sephiroth
i think ill just leave it for now :P
Oh look its that song...
what's it holding
mfw One Winged Angel
^
ohh lux i knew i would love using that laser
oh, perfect, even his theme's playing
otakon: this is a kickass theme though right?
say what you want about the villains, but one-winged angel is best villain song.
The Dissidia arrange is far and away the best.
7:3
choice band sunnybeam sephiroth op
I would laugh so hard if caramel makes himself lose on purpose
A sword that long just seems counter productive
Tifa has the potential to be the strongest character in ff7 most of the time.
twilight_sprinkle: As you can see, his Bravery attacks are fast and with little to no warning. He can eat your Brave with the best of them.
SpadeMagnes[R]: bitch please
SpadeMagnes[R]: eh, its like anime
SEPHIROTH
oh yeah
that reminds me
counter
at the end of october I'm going at Video Games Live
love One winged angel
Reikim: yeah but theyre so weak
she is gettting her ass kicked
twilight_sprinkle: You ARE seeing the damage he's doing with it, right?
Suddenly Sora (Ôºè„Éªœâ„Éª)
7Naked Flea ftw ._.
Reikim: other characters do like 4k bravery per hit
Sora?
no limit break 4 u
uh its Vaan from FF12
Next we should see Tidus vs Jecht
PLEASE DONT TELL ME IM MISSING A KH STREAM
nope
No
"you look good"?
twilight_sprinkle: That's against underleveled characters. What you have to understand about Dissidia is that characters have levels and equipment.
cachi01|phone, Dissidia
phew
is he hitting on her?
cachi01|phone no dearie
cachi01|phone, btw Dissidia>KH
chat derped... >.>
cachi01, now you've got me thinking of the one time I ever went up against Sephiroth in KH...
So what the heck do you have to do to actualy put a dent in the health?
preeeetty
ded
M-M-M-M-MONSTERMILL!!!
Reikim: well i hope youre right, in the demo i was dissappointed *shrug*
that took longer than expected
KILL*
CrimsonPeewee which dissidia? First one or duodecim?
shes ded
for shame Sephiroth
Waah
Quack
lol
both?
I went after him at something like level 40
maybe Duodecim though
Kweh?
twilight_sprinkle: The reason he sucks in Hard mode is because, well, it's hard mode, so the enemies are all higher-leveled. The only thing really annoying about Sephiroth is that his HP moves are really easy to counter.
GNIGHT everypony
since more characters and balance and all
CrimsonPeewee i mean which is being streamed lol
keep kicking ass Caramel
I lived long enough to get his health bar to start dropping...lol
Onion knight!
Duodecim
Random!
Caramel: Tifa.
all random
GILGAMESH
reikim is hard mode is so easy >_>
knocking people all down
Reikim: yeah and he loses his aoe move in hard mode, although his aoe move was weak as it is
Whooo Lightning was my second choice :3
GNIGHT everypony
lawl lightning
Bronysith: Night! :)
CrimsonPeewee btw dissidia = KH both are awesome :)
night Bronysith
nighty Bronysith
So whats the deal with the fat chocobo?
bye Bronysith
Night bronysith
night bronysith
night Bronysith
LIGHTING IS WORST HERO
hey everypony
SpadeMagnes[R] it's...just a fat chocobo
twilight_sprinkle: AGAIN, that's because Hard mode gives you preset moves to make your life more difficult. Build him right in the main game and he's mid-tier.
hai Pearly
KH has more faggots
hey pearly
<.<
Reikim: aw but mid-tier is meh-tier :S
BRB Bath
twilight_sprinkle: In Dissidia, any character's moveset is fully customizable. Down to inputs.
hey LunerRepublicGuard and Dken2021
how are you dears doin'?
twilight_sprinkle: If you want a high-tier character, learn to use Exdeath.
swell Pearly, same for you?
does anyone remember the combo to change lightning's stances?
Reikim: i dont even know what that is :$
yup yup
Caramel: Right trigger.
Or
No
pearly: smashing
screw you garland
Caramel: It's...uh...something to do with left or right trigger and a button.
how is he over level 100
I want to say like, left trigger and circle
CrimsonPeewee i cant beat the fucking emperor with yuna lol
but I don't remember
what's the level cap
twilight_sprinkle: An ever tree and armour
Caramel: Sounds right.
CrimsonPeewee im stuck in that part
Reikim: man this game sounds like tons of fun
Athgaar: 100 for players, 150 for bosses/enemies.
00,03Not enough nubetoobs in this game :[

00,03I had an awesome first day~
Sumica: blizzara
Yea
7>.<
what character is that?
Reikim: does dissidia have multiplayer?
Scoot-Scootaloo: How did it go?
twilight_sprinkle: Local wireless only, unfortunately.
twilight_sprinkle, yes
00,10lightining from ff13
even online
Scoot-Scootaloo: I meant what happened?
wait
I think online....
CrimsonPeewee: No.
nah
aw
but with adhoc party yes
why i get so many pings?
Unfortunately, Dissidia only supports adhoc.
^^
otakon: Because we're trying to goad you into a kick.
00,03I met some cool people, got an okay schedule, and especially some new lady friends ;)
Hello! I'm back!
:kickcount otakon
Reikim: otakon has been kicked 11 times
hai Dark92Enigma
Still?
Scoot-Scootaloo: already? dayum dawg, you fast
So he hasn't been kicked in that many days?
I HAVE BEEN KICKED BY BERRYPUNCH ELEVEN TIMES
Scoot-Scootaloo: suertudote.....:)
that's all that means
00,10lol he just rolled you out of an ex mode Caramel
Punch count
Hello, everypony...
Yeah, and it hasn't gone up in three days, otakon.
I used to use XBconnect before I had Xbox Live and it had psp support too, It was for the Ad-Hoc only games and it pretty much filled the void. Ah, good times :3
Scoot-Scootaloo gets all the ladies.
It's never gunna stop hurting, is it?
undergaaar
Thundaga
otakon that's nothing! I got kicked 158 times!
00,03That's just how I roll~ B)
That acting...
So otakon has not been kicked in three days.
she says spells so weird
Reikim: no but by the mod bots
00,10that reminds me
Ah
Sumica: what?
00,10:kickbot 6 9
Sumica: Setting kickbot to 6 messages in 9 seconds
AZARATH MITRION ZINTHOS!!!!!!!
nuuuuu
Hello, everypony.....
:kickbot
Reikim: This command requires at least 2 parameters.
00,03lolol 69 lolol
Ha
hai Slendermane
Scoot-Scootaloo: So much MLG the ladies can't handle it
Lolol
Dark92Enigma: Azarath Metrion Zynthos
Hey Slendermane :3
hello slendermane :O
Sumica: the hell why?
otakon: Point taken. haven't seen Teen Titans in a looooooooooooooong time
like 6 in 10 isn't bad enough
Dark92Enigma: me neither, liked that show.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9u5yhFAaA1ru5991o8_1280.jpg roflmao
:O ooooh!!
omg that made my night
hi Slendermane
Barbetos poor discord
whats the numbers in the middle for?
LunerRepublicGuard: time limit
Oh
i guess
But it's going up
Dken2021 his pain makes me so happy though, so eh.
Barbetos: haha aww that actually made me feel bad for Discord
00,10numbers in middle are bonus damage for breaking
Whyyyy must GW2 update again?
LunerRepublicGuard: my mistake
Barbetos but he had everything planned, then an annon ruined the surprise :(
Sumi Sumi :3
oni_link I should feel bad for laughing my ass off, to the point of crying, but I am not.
It makes me laugh harder if I think about it.
00,10LadyCanary <3
Barbetos, people would need to see the whole arc
^_^
13canary canary~<3
00,10Caramel is just toying with this guy
but yeah that picture was awesome to end the arc
Because it shows that ArenaNet actually cares about how well the game runs these first few weeks after launch. I think they had a lot more people than expected.
LunerRepublicGuard: When you reduce an enemy's bravery below zero, you get that as a bonus. Most of the time it's constant based on both players' base Brave, but in some stages it fluctuates for various conditions.
Barbetos: I laughed too but I still felt a teeny bit guilty. Just a bit though :P
00,03Scoot Scootaloo~
sure...toying...
CrimsonPeewee Sure, but alone it is still funny i think.
let's go with that <.< >.>
Scoots!
kay....
00,10he's waiting to get a full EX bar
meh it question alot of stuff
oh ello there LadyCanary
Dken2021! :3
sure seeing discord at that state is funny
idk
huh, 1 HP
Huggy please
but the whole story just elevated the humour like 10 000 time more
Last time I had this there was no problem. I had someone who liked me back, someone who also has a heart fetish... Someone who enjoyed hearing my heart as much as I enjoy having someone hear it...
reikim: never seen it when playing ffd
I still don't understand how health works in this game >_>
/me huggies CCCP_
oni_link you shouldn't. Its all apart of his plan of chaos. Everything that discord does is deliberate. He is a chaotic being, who seems to make no sence whatsoever, but you can always count on him being what he is. <3 Discord.
LunerRepublicGuard: It's pretty important, not sure how you didn't...
OtakuTom the health is that horizontal blue bar
yeah
OtakuTom: the smaller numvers on the bottom is health, and the bar
you start with Brave Points
Barbetos: haha I have to make sure to not forget that
Im back :)
then when that's depleted it goes to health
Yea, I understand how to read the health meter, just not how health is gained or lost.
Barbetos: What's going on?
OtakuTom: its not gained
I want to see Gilgamesh in action
you see Lightning has 122,377 health
health is lost by getting hit
/me huggies twilight_sprinkle
cachi01|phone: Welcome back! :)
Okay, so I take it then that brave points are the large number.
CrimsonPeewee: is he in this one?
OtakuTom: There are two types of attacks; Brave, and Health.
yes
UNLEASE THE FURRY!!
no no NO
reikim: not very important when at a high level and playing on hard
OtakuTom: One saps Brave, the other does HP damage based on your Brave.
no unleashing furries dammit
does this game have Zach?
no
LunerRepublicGuard: Yes, I know, I've been there, but I've still noticed.
Reikim theres a part where u play with yuna and u find Tidus with an erased memory i think then u have to fight the emperor to save Tidus
aw
these matchups....
ooh, GOlbez, Final fantasy's Darth Vader
it doesn't have a lot of characters that would fit into a FIGHTING game
Discord reminds me of Slade from Teen Ttans.......think about it: both of them have NO MERCY nor COMPASSION nor ANY SYMPATHY over their victims. And that makes them Awesome villains in my book :)
Oh nothing AJIsAwesome|Homework just my random musings. I try not to share the things I think often, and for good reason. Remember the "love and tolerance" incident? =P
like Sabin
Dken2021, lol
Hey, I just got this game! It's fun
for GOD'S SAKE WHERE IS SABIN, YANG AND CYAN?
So the brave is the large font 4-digit number,and the larger that number is, the more health damage you'll deal when you do a health attack?
Barbetos: Oh, yes. I remember that. :S
Dark92Enigma, though Slade test while Discord just flat out amuse himself
OtakuTom: eeyup
cachi01|phone: Something like that. It's not all that bad. The new story in Dissidia was relatively easy.
OtakuTom: it's also your shield against health damage in a sense
*Duodecim
What game was Laguna in? I dont recognize him
hiya LadyCanary and 8
FF8
8 I think
Ah.
LadyCanary: you like him don't you ^_^
Long story short though, Discord is an awesome character concept, even if was barrowed from another show.
OtakuTom: otakon is confused. Brave does HP damage. It's not a shield, it's a sword.
Okay. That makes some sence, then. Even though I've played Dissidia, I just couldn't understand how the health worked...lol
Barbetos: I honestly don't mind you sharing the things you think. It's nice that you express your opinions. :)
Didnt play much FF so I cant say, otakon.
never played 8, or any playsation game
OtakuTom: You were right the first time.
What is that guy doing in this?
and pretty much most villain have no mercy nor compassion ano sympathy over their victim, thus why they are villains to begin with
FF6 music
wow full bar already
:(
:/ i g2g, hopefully i can come back soon. I have to watch my nephew real quick
airship iirc
00,10dis song
Oh, this music!
this isn't FF6 music is it?
oh crap it is
wor?
Be back later everyone
otakon, eeyup
otakon yes, airship music
yeah
00,10dont know who the guy is though
This person bases the music played on the stage? I base it on my enemy.
god I haven't played that game in years
00,10loch I presume
Sumica: Laguna
sumica Uematsu ,,,
ok so we got a FFVIII against a FFIV with FFVI in a field for.....
00,10who?
Ouch
this was my favorite track form that gmae
That one attack?
Yea, Caramel's currently playing as Laguna from FF8.
Nobuo Uematsu.
what's the field in?
OP much?
the composer of the music?
what Reikim|GW2 said
He's also got one of coolest theme songs, "The Man With The Machine Gun"
The voice acting.
eh
now Gilgamesh?
I don't like FF8 that much
>start up psp
Pretty please?
well, that's all for me now
that japanese texan :p
woah
I don't like the vibe of it
hope you enjoyed
>apparenty I was in a battle on the first dysidia
>die
I don't like the enemies that level with you
NO GILGAMESH?
HERESY
ty for le stremo Caramel
Suddenly over! Thanks Caramel
Thanks for the stream, Caramel :)
sure thing Caramel
Anyone want to play some MvM?
Thanks Caramel!
00,10cant recall who he is
^_^
Caramel: thanks for the stream man, it was enjoyable! good luck with SRW Z2
Caramel, thanks for streaming.
Sumica: WHO is?
thanks Caramel
Thanks for the stream, Caramel
00,10the guy Caramel was useing
Sumica: LAGUNA LOIRE
Laguna
Ty Caramel
Sumica: Laguna from FF8.
Sumica: I said it twice now
CrimsonPeewee: True....Discord does it for the sake of ''creating chaos'', his own term of fun. Slade is more serious and calculative, but i'm saying the lack of emotion -or should i say, compassion- towards their victims is what make them similar. Still, i guess you remember what Slade did to Terra in ''Aftershock part II''
Caramel I'm going to dip apples on you and lick every inch of that apple slowly to see you suffer in agony as I then slowly bit the apple little by little.
RRRRAAAWWWEEEERRR!!!!!!!!!!!
dem walls
thanks for the stream Caramel
00,10yeah and I said I dont recall who he is twice now otakon
Thank you Caramel!
hai
^&^
hai RainbowDash90
Sumica: another protagionist from the okay FF8
Minor character. Move along.
ello rainbowdash90
not really minor
Hi AJIsAwesome|Homework!
I wouldn't really call him a minor character...
cause licking an apple is inapropriate?
but you don't know what the hell his deal is until way later
CrimsonPeewee uh wha?
Dark92Enigma: Hi! :)
a Caramel coated apple?
CrimsonPeewee: well dipping it in caramel(the one here) is i think
/me gets turned on.
stop that
it was a pun
sheesh
it was a bad pun
Caramel u playing on emulator or real psp? If u are on psp, want to fight online?
it's a real PSP
an inappropriate pun
keep it pg13 ;)
he's got a hook up cable
bleh....
Well, stream's over. Time to get back to PSO2. Right? EeeeeeeNOPE! Maintenance!

NullRadix: seems interesting. :D

Kandarihu hmm, I might, just hope the game's not that heavy on preformance
nigh Rei...gone
cachi01|phone, you'll need adhoc party for online
AJIsAwesome|Homework: its a mostly fun fic, a little back and forth there
NullRadix: Hmm....what genre is it?

LadyCanary in....teresting
....I LOVE HIM :)
XylemTube...
I never was able to get very far into this series. I forgot what foced me to miss an episode. Maybe it was a simple derp.
thats right
rage comics are awesome. at least all the ones ive seen are great
^
damn long intro
-Sigh-
hiya Mica!
twilight_sprinkle, do you know why I find ALL OF THEM horrible?
Personally, I prefer Ash Like Snow.
otakon Like 1:45?
so
Well, this time, dinnertime is going to force me to fall out of continuity.
Favorite gundam?
Mike's brain is going to explode when he reads that comment...
Deathscythe personallly ;)
Dark92Enigma: that's fairly long for a anime opening
otakon that's the length of the DBZ original intro
Ryunosuke: series or suit?
suit :p
CrimsonPeewee: nu, and find them why all horrible?
CrimsonPeeWee: rage comics are bad and good but people are gona still post
Ryunosuke: as in favorite Gundam generation?
I love the Gouf Custom from 8th MS Team
or FAVORITE Gundam?
favorite suit :p
Gouf Custom
what does aeu stand for again? been years since i last saw this
Dovah: Anti something Unit most likely
cachi01|phone: i do like memes and rage comics but not love em
otakon: i know its not that
that building must have entire playlists for elevator music
or All Environment Unit I'm just guessing
Oh......i like the main one.....the white one <------- I haven't seen this in a very long time
Bogey?
Get a tissue dammit
gundum wing 0?
no
Yesterday i found this rage comic Assaulter: give me all your money guy: hey thats a nice knife, i will give u all my money for it Assaulter: ok! *gives knife* Guy: ok now give me all ur money :trollface:
it's 00
what comment?
i have seen this anime
cachi01|phone: boooo
blocking
twilight_sprinkler its funnier when u see the pic Xd
IT'S A GUNDAM!
ITS A GUNGAN
No shit
welp this guy is either dead or really damn good
he's dead
he ded
Opan Gundam style
Military Ace in first ep against a Gundam?
HIS NAME, IS, PATRICK
ded or very badly beaten
Rick.
Vibroblade
sucks
twilight_sprinkle, DJ_POn-3 they all are horrible because it lacks of everything that make arts good, they're lazy copy pasting, uncreative, shows the lack of talent you have and even then the face are just doodles. You could waste your time on something more productive and talent developping instead of copy pasting face to describe some minor event that no one cares about.
I meant this? http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Wing_Gundam_Zero
twilight_sprinkler http://img5.joyreactor.com/pics/post/auto-comics-rage-comics-trollface-268595.jpeg
Lockon be pissed.
It's the purest insult to the creative domain
so much for their "ace"
CrimsonPeewee: assuming its meant to be art?..
00,10no lockon yet
CrimsonPeewee: the hell was that?
CrimsonPeeWee: i understand
twilight_sprinkle, it's a waste of time
Ah.
Right.
CrimsonPeewee........ I cant see ur point sorry lol
and they ain't even funny in the slightest
CrimsonPeewee: the fact that its so easy to do and accessible makes it great, everyone can make a comic easily, and if the jokes good then the drawing supports the humor
you could DRAW those face YOURSELF
yea, with CrimsonPeewee here, don't really like rage comics as much these days
Originally, the whole concept of Mobile Suits were designed with a massive internal minopsky reactor to get around the square-cube law that renders giant robots virtually impossible in real life. Flash forward to nowadays, and we have a Mobile Suit that's powered by solar energy. My suspension of disbelief is only possible by the Enact proving to be useless in combat.
CrimsonPeewee: I'm not standing up for rage comics (I'm neutral about them anyways), but you do know there are inspirational rage comics, right?
i cant
I told him more about the chest pain
did i just see a LE EPIK RAGE FAEC comic linked?
CrimsonPeewee: dude its not art, its a joke
good god
CrimsonPeewee i cant
Buytoast yep
twilight_sprinkle, YOU CAN MAKE THE FACES YOURSELF
that's horrible
CrimsonPeewee: THATS THE POINT
Kandarihu: GIANT FUCKING ROBOTS...that is all
twilight_sprinkle, no need to be detailed
that's like crapping in a pool and making the children swim next to it
CrimsonPeewee: its.not.art. its a joke
hell actually giant *fucking* robots is kind of scary
the fact that it's accessible makes the thing lazy
and degrade the human race
does he know about ur heart fetish?
CrimsonPeewee: its like complaining about a car that doesnt have a refrigirator
CrimsonPeewee: WHAT is? what are you talking about?
Oh god.
CrimsonPeewee dude........ U mad?
you draw those face and develop your drawing
Yea
lol cachi01|phone
which gundam is this?
00,10LadyCanary likes the emo guy eh?
otakon: hes saying why ragecomics suck
LOL Sumica XD
oh
Spitfire Gundam 00
or you copy paste and leave your lack of talent at that
And I know all about his fetish, heh heh heh
Sumica: she likes the pretty boys
and the jokes are horrible even
cachi01|phone: yeah the comic looks better with the pic, you said it a bit wrong too :P
I personally like memes, as long as they're smart, catchy and memorable
Lyra likes Mr.teal suit <3
Actually, best friend does Sumi.
whats his fetish? :P
oh yeah and the l"e"?
00,10ahhh
pee
you know
I have to ask
IT'S A FUCKING DISGRACE TO THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
haha cool
It needs to be about 20% cooler
rage comics aren't that funny to me anymore, maybe if I was around 16, maybe, but now, they seem effortless mostl
Zero Gravity and skirts....
00,10I like how they show the 0g in this
Hey it's Chun Li
CrimsonPeewee: i find a lot of the jokes to be good. as for the drawings, the point is for them to be accessible to everyone, and the art often supports the joke
when I type something in french someone will see the le and think
twilight_sprinkle yeah i dont know how to explain things with mah words lol well atleast in english
LOL RAGE COMICS
CrimsonPeewee LOL RAGE COMICS
otakon, that excuse might almost work for a Super Robot series. This is a Real Robot series.
I tell him every time I pee xD
what's the point of le anyway? to be edgy?
^
"edgy"
XD
Dken2021: no idea
:D HARO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just do it bc I think it's funny
Dken2021: for to be silly
00,10le sigh
Dken2021 to be fancy??? Idk lol
....
Kandarihu: they're still giant goddamn robots
they need to make a proper Steel Battalion Game dammit
Haro Haro Haro <3
le sets the light mood and silliness
not that goddamn worthless kinect crap
You can just make a simple face drawing as well
kinect is best console ever
I remember back when rage comics where only in 4chan
CrimsonPeewee honestly i cant....
you know what they did?
well, don't mind the people liking rage comic, as for me, no thanks
Sumica: is this the first ep?
THEY MADE THEIR OWN DRAWING
00,10yes
Kinect is a failure and always will be unless they do some major repairs to it.
thats probably pretty annoying haha
Hehe
gratuitous english words
seconda phasu
If I wanted motion controls I would use the Wii
LE TROLLING RAUNDOM RAGE COMIC XDXD
Kinect < ps move < wii
I honestly liked the idea of Kinect, but the way it performs is terrible and I wish they invested more time in it.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: it wouldn't be so bad if they didn't use shit parts and try to put it in every goddamn fucking game that's coming out for the sake of coming out
otakon: True.
at least someone is with me here
One time he told me he couldn't sleep cuz his heart was goin fast and I was just all like ASDFGHJKL @///@ MY HEART....
AjIsAwesome yeah i also thought project Natal looked awesome
But guess what! ITS SHIT
My opinion on memes: They need to be about 20% cooler
haha
at least the kinect spawned some uses other than a video game addon
CrimsonPeewee: look, youre missing the point. youll never understand it if you cant get past the simple drawing part. its not art, its not meant to be amazing, its meant to be available for everyone to do and the art often supports the silliness
AJIsAwesome|Homework: take ME3 for example had squad commands with the kinect. that you could have EASILY done with the goddamn mic on a 20 buck headset but fuckt hat shit
With kinect u can Shout fus ro dah xd
CrimsonPeewee: it's just meant to be funny is all, remember not everyone has the same sense of umor
so much words... they are not cool..
otakon: Agreed.
Kandarihu: I liked it
I smell a kick?
twilight_sprinkle, I get what you mean and I still say that it's horrible to mankind to resort in stuff that others already did to tell their own story
must be one stinky kick
yay! Post Mortem promontions!
My bro while playing skyrim with kinect: FUS RO DAH FUS RO DAH work goddammit!
oh hey it's ada wong
cachi01|phone: lol
why is she in gundam land
Idiot.
oh lookie a chinese dressed chick
I've never really seen any gundam at all.
Anyway goodnightbeverypony
Loved this better than the actual fanfic... http://i.imgur.com/oR4UU.jpg
If there's one good thing that the Kinect is good for, it's homebrew Motion Capture.
I hate the uniformal style this has
CCCP_: NIght! :)
bye CCCP_ sleep well take care
:(
Kinect is getting fucking shoehorned into every game
I think the problem with some memes these days is that they aren't as accidental anymore, now it's user generated and over used way too often
Brad_ same here
I've never been big on the whole skinny body look too much
For gods sake stop complaining and just watch the goddamn Gundams.
CrimsonPeewee: well plagiarism of jokes i another matter, a lot messier and, frankly, impossible to properly see
Brad_, MLD is overrated
CrimsonPeewee, I agree
LadyCanary: skinny body desings look weird to me
Overhyped too.
true, the troll meme is often overused, here as well tbh
CrimsonPeewee: True, and so is Cupcakes. Cupcakes is a terriblly written fanfic.
Kyrios....
LadyCanary there are some gundams arguing Bout the same in the background
Wait was that Allelujah's gundam?
no idea
I'm SO glad this series EASES YOU IN
AjIsAwesome no. SAM is a terribly written fanfic
AJIsAwesome|Homework, indeed, it ain't the gore that makes it terrible it's really the whole writing style
oh wait it explains NOTHING
00,10it's an introduction ep otakon
....Oh mama....I like giant guns :3
ah, gundam, a series I could've got hooked to, but my younger self wasn't interested at the time, oh well
Sumica: it introduces NOTHing
otakon: EXPLAIN, SERIES! EXPLAIN!!!!
