Probably, SecondSeraphim. They just don't show 'em in the series
4What do you mean, nah2?
Yes, Seraphim, there probably are. There's probably also a Don Juan-type pony. Lots of people have different talents.

are the 4chan people still in?

6Oh noes.
DASH BEIN STRAIGHT IS NOT AN OPTION
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE
0STRAIGHT daship? OLOLO
wats after this movie?
Dash is straight.
Shits about to go down
4I don't either
7neither do I
>only 5 people
oh
the only straight ship fic for Dash that makes sense yeah
Oh, no she's not
7I just read and try to understand :)
6._.
:P
0Appledash is weh but makes incredibly much sense.
4And Vito is alive
0Pacino has balls
...NO
4That's about it
faust didn't say anything on the matter
I think Dash is totally uninterested.
best STRAIGHT Dash ship pair: discuss
lol
nah wat others are there
*licks the spike*
I think Dash is asexual.
Faust said "Not going there"
And she reproduces asexually.
oh, nvm
Yeah, faust has no opinion on pony sexuality.
she said it isn't in the show, nor is it even a concern
0no Zambrony, Faust never said that, she just said that she doesn't necessarily have to be gay
Dash is without a doubt asexual
Look to the left, Mob movie. Look to the right, Dash shipping discussion.
only rarity cares about anything, all others are oblivious
I sense a mob...
in other words, she said there is no canon on that because it doesn't exist
Dash is omnisexual
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vteZ1YXZlOLBPQKIDqgbW9eksbdZg3fWosXYPWM-2Kw/edit?hl=en
Dash/Soarin
imo

0So I herd you liek fish
meh.jpg
0lol
4Alright
Be patient
6o.o
you're evil people, 'bronies'...
he was 5'7
whining? I am not whining...
4The Wicker Man (original) for "A" film
^
I am complaining.
that was a myth spread by the english
0He was actually slightly taller then the average frenchmen
0how much longer does this have
5
ololol Elky
XD
I stopped caring about this movie a looooong time ago
lol elky
6You think that having those two makes me obsessed? :P
0I'm not evil... now my brother...
the only line rarity made that i like.
we just made the movie 20% cooler thats all
boo yeah
*Russia
no, this movie isn't cool
he was 5 7 in french feet
6Cause it's much worse than that..
sorry film fans
which is five ten in our feet
the best is yet to come.
I think
0Catchy
has russia ever been successfully invaded
BECAUSE NOPONY INVADES RUSSIA!
i like winter wrap up
I like this movie actually.
Forgive me while I go cry myself to sleep now
This is a very good movie, but it's not a movie you can possibly watch while distracted.
lol
he was 5'7 in french feet, which is 5'2 by imperial measurement
8abe vigoda lol
as long as they're not boring
and aren't 3 hours long
Everyone says this is the best movie ever... But I don't get it
My blessing...you has it
its ok DSN this movie is for a niche audience
Abe Vigoda, Before GoodBurger
;)
4eww
but wwu is my favorite song
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
Lol no :P i guess obsessed was to extreme of a word, do you like the sims a whole lot?
0APPLEJACK IS STILL BEST PONY
Rainbow Dash's part of every song is the best
even though I don't really like Rainbow, dari is right here.
4And...hmm
rainbow dash's solo may have been the best thing on TV evar
Hipster_Brony: Yeah, but I like it over Winter Wrap Up.
:o
fluttershy and RD are the best
Applejack ought to get one song of her own in Season 2 at least.
cool
8eh
I think britain invaded russia too...
never really liked applejack
6Yeah..
WWU won the 'suprise song' award
8i like Dash's verse on WWU more
4mfw the only "B" film I can think of is Freddy Got Fingered >.<
Applejack had the best part of WWU however
4But that's my choice
This movie needs to winter wrap up!
Was the light brigade english or french?
4WAIT
Heyyo!
4NO
No, I'm gonna agree that Dash had the best part in WWU
lol, that's because you like anything with Dash :P
and let the sunshine iiiin
0agreed Elky
8AJ's verse on WWU wasn't very good IMO
Want me to give a suggestion?
6I basically have all the sims games on my computer..exept from the TS3 expansions..
4That's my "B" choice
lol
6o.o
Oh.
8weakest part of the song
xD
0AJ verse is best verse!
4Thanks guys
:(
Season two needs a Fluttershy song. About the length of AoTD at least.
but Twi's solo was fantastic in WWU
0APPLEJACK NEEDS MORE EVERYTHING.
Dash needs moar songs
We tamed the biggest country in the world
0Light Brigade was English
MONTAGE TIME
wat?
but season 1 had a fluttershy song
I just wanted to see BFE
0It should just be called the applejack show
Applejack needs more hats
1940S LAS VEGAS FTW!!!!!
See? Thats why i use obsessed
ikr
8disagree about twilight dari
0Led by Lord Cardington
uh, Ashleigh Ball is a singer actually...
oh shit, this is going to take a while
umm
0I'm liking this idea.
WHY
WHYYYYY
0applejack needs more sentrys and dispensers
Applejack isn't really that loved is she.
APPLEJACK BEST PONY FLUTTERSHY SECOND BEST PONY RAINBOW DASH THIRD BEST PONEY
8twilight is my 2nd favorite, after Dash
I can't seem to like Pinkie too much, I suppose...
I'd like an AJ/RD duet in season 2
Season Two needs a Fluttershy song that takes up an entire span of time between commercials.
lots of people do not like rarity, i do not see why
Rarity is best pony
No memorable episodes for applejack
easy
Purple pony is best pony.
:P
suddenly dancing
The best two are Fluttershy and Rarity
0Does anybody even like Rarity? She's kind of a bitch.
Hi there, everypony!
pony pokey
FUCK YOU SEXYSQUIRT! Fluttershy is best pony.
She's a fabulous bitch though
I don't really like Twilight all that much.
+
oops
I think he fell asleep.
0I like Rarity
she's friggin adorkable though
TWILIGHT IS BEST PONY
6What's up?
Luna is best pony
0She's not my favourite though
deal with it
0One fabulous bitch.
twilight's? really? did you even look at Fluttershy?
heh.
7will you be around tomorrow?
6Icy grew up and is wearing a hat!
LUUUUNA
here's the pony debate
i like Twilight though =/
RD#1, FS#2, AJ#3, PP#4, TS#5, Rarity#6
I wish Tara Strong recorded on sight with the others. I think the separation does hinder her voice work.
4lol
IF ANY OF THEM WERE REAL PEOPLE I'D DAT ANY OF THEM THOUGH
LOL
she's adorkable
THAT DAMN SONG IS STUCK IN MY HEAD
*on site
0What movie are we watching, guys?
WHY DOES EVERYPONY HATE RARITY?
0OH NO
give me abreak
0I used to like Fluttershy until she became popular.
0ZOMBIE PONIES
Rarity is awesome
FLAMES AWAY
0RARITY IS BEST PONY
0Rarity is epitome of BITCH
7ghost
fluttershy cuts it close for second place
0AK IS BLAND
whats that pony called that is related to rarity?
8Prison: The Godfather
0AJ
Pinkie pie is sad now
we're making lists?
Because she should be called Vanity, that's why.
*brohoofs nah*
Fluttershy is best pony
HOORAY FOR ACCORDIAN
because rarity is frankly a whiny, egotistical bitch
0We gotta lotta Applejack-ers here!
Rainbow Dash is best pony.

The credits music is great at least.
I'm rather disappointed to see that showing this movie made more haters than fans
The Godfather starts very slowly, and introduces a lot of completely uninteresting characters (like Michael's first wife, and Sonny) just to kill them off. Frankly, the first two hours could be shaved down to one without losing very much.
IT IS DONE
SOUTH COST ZIGGAS!
oh he's gone.
This had the worst music of any movie ever
AAAAAAAAAA
4Oh boy
