Very few of us are ready for what happens next. One of our brilliant readers suggested that people don't warn you about three for one reason. It's not that they hate you, it's that th

0OH GOD
Has he been cheating on me? :'(
4It's humorous when almost all of the main chat is just people talking to one another and not even speaking about the film
Wouldn't Spike be epic as the Godfather?
Oh, I forgot I was holding the shift key down.
0Doesn't someone die here
mcdonalds car.

Never quite understood why he thought that plan would work.
oh. sorry The_Pale_Horse, you should have been more specific
/me waves at all the mods.
this music makes me feel like a sir while i eat. amazing
let get down to business
Spike as the Godfather is now canon in my mind.
needs someone fat for Godfather
@vikingbrony you're gonna be back in 36 hours?
spike godfather would be crazy
8anon: brilliant
/me yawns =w=
What could possibly go wrong>

He's going to kill someone I think
something terrible's going to happen to that young couple, isn't it?
winter wrap up
10already focused on the chat and listening to music instead
because winter is boring
4Se7en was still the best "A" movie we've seen so far
celestia is the godfather
0Murder is in the air
:3
And have fun at the meet tomorrow
10i concur ghosties
MFW I missed Se7en.
TACOWIZ, Y U NO STOP BUGGING ME?!
aww crap, my lung hurts like hay. I wonder if food went the wrong tube...
@ghosties starship troopers
Someone should make a godfather style pony fic, in 13th century alliterative verse
I smell murder
0Here we go
@ghosties agreed
@Dermathil Probably
8SOON
I didn'T really care about se7en
THat'd take a lot of time TheOwl
I missed Se7en too. And I had never seen it.
:o
Creepy honey bear is creepy. D:
0dead guy walking
4nah: nope
but maybe that was because of the chat
I've never seen it either Zambrony.
i know you
Did it just start
Agreed, Ghosties. Other than Kick-Ass, but I'm still a little unclear if that was the A or B movie
PREPARE FOR DEATHSCENE
You're telling me yay4friends
4That was a "B" movie
se7en is a good movie
@ghosties yep
for example, I preferred kick-ass
@ghosties HERETIC
0We can do business
/me notices he accidentally hit capslock. uncaps it before the unforgivable happens.
we can all agree worst movie was the one chosen by tacowiz WHICH SHALL NOT BE NAMED
GabeMoist: It will frighten you again.
kick-ass was a movie
4Starship Troopers was the "B" movie for that week
4So no
Seriously. Why did they think this plan would work?
7agreed
4It doesn't count
07Night ^^ thanks
/me agrees with HaxBrony
0Corleone

I think we should watch The Room *gets murdered for suggesting it*
@Dman Mentlegen
4That's easy, Evil Dead II
13I've seen them :3
4Best "B" movie yet
0DEAD

Fail assassin is fail.
I'm with Elky on that one
why are they killing him...?
No, best b-movie is House and House II
lol
How do you classify a B movie?
I thought we all could agree on that
BRUTALITY!
I'm torn between Deathstalker II, Evil Dead 2 and The Room for best B movie
Love and Garotte
EVIL DEAD IS A MATERIAL CUZ ITS SO GROOVY
Ghosties: Did it just start?

@dmanstew because race horse
I love you dad
oh my
le mafia italina

I want to somehow, in someway ponify the movie Clue
By budget, Purple
oh my
that isn't love and tolerance
He'll be fine
Deathstalker was pretty damn bad
Deathstalker II if we add our soundtrack
Is he died?
the room wins.
We should totally watch Space Mutiny.
that was unexpected
Evil Dead, because it is freakin' hilaruous.
4No, Glass_Arm. The show began at 6
Deathstalker II was amazing.
But it's arguable what makes an A or B movie
That's nasty way to die...
0He dead
ah
evil dead did have that awesome camera 1st person scene
evil dead 2 was good, but no match for the unbridled awesomeness that was ds2
ok, bye
DS II was awesome!
The room > all other b movies I've seen.
what's the border, then?
Hey c7?

pizza is the secret to muffins
shop smart, shop s-mart

Had Bruce Cambell been in ds2 we would have no arguement
I'm liking the fedoras

BTW, I heard there is a remake of Evil Dead 1 on the way.
Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun
8did he died?
@combustiblelemons we don't talk about that night.
Watch out for Oranges

Dam random encounters, they always happen at the worst possible minute

6Indeed it does.. ._.
@slendermane needs to be farther in the background

I wasn't scared of Slenderman until I was lost in the woods at night. Then suddenly EVERYWHERE.

lol typos, what's a Slendernap???
@slendermane thing about slendy is that you gotta focus to see him
3rd can of redbull down
slenderman is creepy. But I saw littlekiruboh's slenderman and I laughed.

it was a picture link, technically
omg I cannot type, GUESS WHO TOOK ALCOHOL AND MEDS TODAY?!
I AM Slenderman
a very scary monster photoFINISHHIM
4Slendernap is when Slenderman takes a nap :3
YES
BTW, I am currently suspecting Sethisto of using Trixie as a vigilante identity.
Uh oh. Are we at the diner scene??
He's dead Jim
He has long tentacles for arms
and it was relevant to the discussion
4Alright, I see
lol

8thats later in the movie
You have not seen D'Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww until you've seen Slenderman napping

Apparently mixing alcohol and medicine being bad is a myth.
They must be reading Fox News
14I didn't think the origin would be on TV Tropes
and a family man
14link?
lol
I told you he was okay!
Depends on the medicine
You have a point
The paper did say it was rumors people.
I got the idea of Pinkie from someone here.
I heard mixing alcohol and vanilla extract is bad
I'm a business man, I make it my business to be a man
0They both affect the liver.
yeah Elky, so if I make any typos its because beer and meds make a terrible cocktail
why is it winter all of a sudden?
you should always check if your prescrip meds don't mix with something
er
well alchohol and mac and cheese make movies better. myth confirmed
I keep picturing photo finish as all the scummy mobsters and it is honesty funny

4Not sure if Senor_BroZilla was talking to me, but there's nothing interesting about a bunch of wiseguys that constantly plot against one another and speak with cottonballs in their mouths
@Zambrony, you should be fine. You'll have to learn who the other characters are, though. Thankfully, enough of them have already died that it's a manageable task.
Why would you only send one guy?

Lol saying wtf to me bending over when all it was was a little dance
6Hey, Night.
being discovered is the damn worst feeling in the world
6Okay.

That Senator in arizona proved thaty
if you wanna die, jump off a building
still glad it's off my chest
anyone where i can find a shirt with derpy on it?

007 the world is not enough dudes
Got a REBAR through his head and lived
it's much safer
Depends on the caliber. You can actually be aware for a couple seconds with a low caliber weapon to the head like a .22
he call me an asshole
and now to work on converting my friends...
It usually is, but it has to hit a specific spot.
6Aaahh.. xDD
Sup doods, I'm back.
VYNIL SCRATCH ON THE PIANO EVERYONE
we need a Senator caught as a brony
using guns is bullshit, as are meds
it is if you hit the right spot. it's called 'the point of humane destruction' and it's where you shoot when you're trapping or euthenizing livestock
not enough Pony merch here in England
Play yankee doodle dandy!
a senator brony
that'd be something.
FREE BIRD
OCTAVIO ON THE PIANO, You udes
dude the room is spinning
A bullet to the brain also doesn't normally hit the STEM of the brain, which directs basic movement
@combustiblelemons reference the show whenever u talk to them. they get so ennoyed they look it up

Just wondering what you were thinking by me bending over...*watches* naughty naughty little one
sideways is an instant killshot
0InsertCupcake: That's why there's eBay.
I already told them to give it a try
0Since there's nowhere else to buy them

0Amberlamps
I got all McDonalds ponies off ebay for $50. Considering the effort it takes to collect them I think it's a fair deal.
No, but what are they, molded hair, or not?
>mfw official hug day is brought forth to legislature
baing a brony is way to diverse to know what a brony senator would do
someone get to work on pony politics fic
WOO WOO WOO

oh Dash, you can be my spoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
I wonder if bill clinton is now a brony...
Iz take care of him
KristjanKirax, it depends on what kind of University, who your friendgroup is, which types of classes. It is impossible to correctly gauge potential responses without knowing most of the variables.
10dashite I mean president, as in USA :P
ghosties you're the new secretary of state
i mean
yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
0Ah
Bill clinton is my favourite US president :P
DU DUUUUU
4Take care of who?
anyone can just make up a trip if they want to
6But he's my sim! D:
Boy, boys, you don't have to fight over me. Dash, photo, play nice
4But why?
brony movie night is my waifu
@combustiblelemons maybe some of the love and tolerence would rub off on hillary
6My Icy sim..
its not adding any extra security
But they'd never vote for you. You aren't insane enough to get elected in the US.

Did KristjanKirax get that?

Every pony is always in love with Dash. The only reason not to be is if you don't swing her way... and that just means you're in denial.
silvermane gets to be in RD shipping fics? lucky motherfuker
Still im watching you...*licks my jealousy claws*
Dear Princess Celestia,

Oh RainBroDash, you silly filly
why is SilverMane not OC canon yet?
OKay. I hope whatever KristjanKirax decides to do, it will go well.
Tourist: *click click click click*

6May I say that I have no such intentions for ze Icy.
8so thats why equestria is all girls...
nice
because there are no OCs yet...
0Silver... that's just silly. Who doesn't swing towards awesome rainbow ponies?
I liked the fic where EVERYPONY tries to hook up with dash and then at the end it turns out she's heterosexual.

Oh please, Dash x Spitfire is FAR more likely.
Also hey Aurora~ not much
Sorta...
10photofinishhim I agree. DashxSoarin is almost as good as DashxVinyl
In Virginia Beach
Everything i know about Italy I learned from Hetalia
Is this movie almost over?
I dunno, it interferes with my OTP of Soarinxapplepie photofinishhim
6Meh.. xP
13.w.
8it was... interesting
I think the filmography in general looks fantastic...
*brohoof* thetrollside
Dash x Soarin' needs more Spitfire, absolutely.
DASH X SOARIN IS BETTER!!!
Appledash is canon
*holds my crotch* dammit icy

okay bronies, I'm talking about the only STRAIGHT Dash ship, DashxVinyl Scratch and DashxSpitfire are best otherwise
03but I had to fix mine with duct tape and that kinda sucks
but Soarin likes pies!
6CAUSE THAT'S THE COOL THING TO DO
I'm not even sure what the chat is about atm
And this one time, she flew so fast, she gave all her friends puberty
>_<
SoarinxPinkiePie!

everyone fwiendly

6Oh noes.
DASH BEIN STRAIGHT IS NOT AN OPTION
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE
IS SOARIN X DASH THE ONLY STRAIGHT MLP SHIP FIC?
appledash is best, fuck all yall
Soarinxpinkie pie? that's new
0STRAIGHT daship? OLOLO
wats after this movie?
4HaxBrony: Haha, their cutie marks=puberty
Dash is straight.
what owl said
Shits about to go down
Appledash is meeeh
4I don't either
7neither do I
>only 5 people
eeyup
oh
seriously, why a Bible Black parody?
though AJxRarity iseven better
the only straight ship fic for Dash that makes sense yeah
Oh, no she's not
Dash is straight, Faust said so somewhere
7I just read and try to understand :)
@themarewhoarrangestheblocks nope
6._.
i refuse to accept that thetrollside
Sorry I'm late
:P
0Appledash is weh but makes incredibly much sense.
4I think Michael might have an affair with this Sicilian woman
Damn rainbows being associated with gays...
4And Vito is alive
0Pacino has balls
more actually faust said "Who the hell cares?"
...NO
4That's about it
faust didn't say anything on the matter
I think Dash is totally uninterested.
What's happened so far?
best STRAIGHT Dash ship pair: discuss
lol
nah wat others are there
*licks the spike*
I think Dash is asexual.
Faust said "Not going there"
0stupid gays associating themselves with rainbows
Happy Brony Day!
And she reproduces asexually.
oh, nvm
Yeah, faust has no opinion on pony sexuality.
she said it isn't in the show, nor is it even a concern
8i personally think of all the ponies as straight because im straight and i think of that as "normal"
@combustiblelemons gays only use them cuz they represent diversity
Dash is without a doubt asexual
although the best dash ship is rainbow dash x cloudy dash
Look to the left, Mob movie. Look to the right, Dash shipping discussion.
iirc, she said sexual stuff won't be in the show
themarewhoarrangestheblocks ziggy and scratch and then everyone and mac

God damn internet! I missed it!
You could injure yourself that way, Hipster

I AM DAVE! YOGNAUT AND I HAVE THE BALLS!
hehehe
yeah, you don't make it full screen Silverfish2
I AM DAVE
How do you turn the pony mod off after you install it?
it's fun if you're creative aponymous.
I thought about getting minecraft, but it semms like a game you get bored of quickly
AND I HAVE BALLS OF STEEL
0Terraria = Minecraft... for different reasons... just saying
0I AM DAVE! YOGNAUGHT AND I HAVE THE BALLS
BALLS OF STEEL
STEEL
0it is
I am giving some thought to adding FM to my low power radio station
STEEL
Theres a lot of love an tolerance in there.
6Me?
0thats why i just torrent it :3
terraria is like minecraft, but with more rpg elements
/me 8cant imagine ever being entertained by minecraft
Thats a very nice everything you've got there!
yogscast are bronies by the way.
BALLS ARE INERT
good god when does this film end
0It was Vizini all along. Wasn't he from the Princess Bride?
I love that line; "Tattaglia's a pimp, he could never have outsmarted Sonny"
well one of them are.
0How did we get to a discussion about Minecraft?
Minecraft has better multiplayer though....
It never ends.
0Vizini?
you can torrent minecraft?
ugh this is torturous
I AM DAVE! YOGNAUT AND I HAVE THE BALLS!
thought it was going to be today but I got a crap transmitter that will not pass RDS and is broken for FM stereo
terraria has better singleplayer
Minecraft was fun for a while, then i just got tired of building buildings
I think Hipster
Terraria is a metroidvania mixed with minecraft. Best description.
can someone give me an estimate as to how much longer this is?
ADD Hobo
get's cooler every week
how far in are we, sprinkles?
I thought it worked with an account system
I said the same thing too Hipster, until I played it and got hooked. (Ignoring the fact that after a few months I'm now bored with it <.< >.>)
..yes :P
Minecraft is like the Hitler of video game talks. Everything eventually leads to it.
0lol
or actually
Any word on a mac version for TErraria?
how much time is left?
6Sims :P
this movie needs more cheese
I don't knoowwww
I don't know what the point of minecraft is
Which one
But I want it to be over
EH MARCO?
6Woo! River became a teen.. :3
man this movie is torturously slow...
I think there's around 30 mins left, not too sure
Thats a very nice everything you've got there!^
OMG NO WAI! official character description videos on youtube
0If you are true yognaughts finish this sentence: I am a Dwarf and I'm digging a _
oh god 30 minutes
Getting a gold chest is like finding a chozo statue in metroid
Ok, I missed it, what happened to Micheal's hot Sicilian wife?
awesums
30 minutes?!
the point of Minecraft is autism
as far as I can tell it's about making buildings in 1993 graphics
I love the background music though
owl: you have to determine the point yourself
Basically
30 mins left?
God, some of you guys are so impatient. :P
This movie is about 3 hours long.
No staying power.
pfffff
the plot of this movie has screwed the pooch
0hole, diggy diggy hole, Digging a hole
0Hole.
0Yeah!
Unknown: she got blown up in his car
jesus balls in heaven this movie is too long

Oh crap that sucks.

Sorry for the spoilers xP

InsertCupcake And blood flying back into their bodies

D:
XD
"Legitimate" business.
0lol
so about 20 mins left
every minute is amazing imo
4Oh shit, I forgot about the selection thread
xD
0He's kinda short
4Listen
it's a shame that modern society is so impatient now...Sleep well classic cinema, your life was well lived
So there are like... 20 minutes left?
NOW GET IN
When did the movie start?
*fluttershy voice* 3 hours long... that's what I said...
END MOVIE
damn
Its not too late its never too late
4If I don't make it back in time, can I just give you guys my two picks?
and then they all fucked, the end, finite
Silverfish2 Well, short people often do have inferiority complexes. Look at Napoleon for example.
Get Kay on the rebound!
>Hot wife dies in fiery explosion... get second best
freaking chat and freaking wine made me not enjoy this movie...
sure
4In the case I'm selected?
0So I herd you liek fish
meh.jpg
0lol
4Alright
Napoleon wasn't really that short
Wait for when Corleone dies, it's a funny scene imo
Be patient
Napoleon wasnt short
6o.o
shoot im left handed
you're evil people, 'bronies'...
he was 5'7
whining? I am not whining...
4The Wicker Man (original) for "A" film
^
4th red bull down 1 left
I am complaining.
that was a myth spread by the english
0He was actually slightly taller then the average frenchmen
0how much longer does this have
5
he just surrounded himself with 6'8 body guards
Napoleon was angry because of all his hemorroids
ololol Elky
XD
I stopped caring about this movie a looooong time ago
lol elky
6You think that having those two makes me obsessed? :P
0I'm not evil... now my brother...
once i break that wall of being tired i wont need anymore
5'7 is short in modern times, but not back in the day.
the only line rarity made that i like.
we just made the movie 20% cooler thats all
And then he invaded Russian and screwed himself over. :D
boo yeah
*Russia
no, this movie isn't cool
it's boring as hell
0My favorite MLP song is Rarity's
he was 5 7 in french feet
6Cause it's much worse than that..
sorry film fans
which is five ten in our feet
the best is yet to come.
I think
0Catchy
just like with se7en... I have to remember not to watch serious movies with you...
has russia ever been successfully invaded
BECAUSE NOPONY INVADES RUSSIA!
i like winter wrap up
I like this movie actually.
0Everyone who has invaded Russia has suffered a crushing a defeat
Forgive me while I go cry myself to sleep now
This is a very good movie, but it's not a movie you can possibly watch while distracted.
lol
he was 5'7 in french feet, which is 5'2 by imperial measurement
8abe vigoda lol
I'm fine with serious movies
as long as they're not boring
and aren't 3 hours long
Everyone says this is the best movie ever... But I don't get it
0Or the Gala, if only for Rainbow's solo
My blessing...you has it
Rainbow Dash's section of the gala song is the most awesome.
its ok DSN this movie is for a niche audience
Uhh hate to burst your bubble but the french did
It's mainly because said people who invade Russia are retards.
Abe Vigoda, Before GoodBurger
At the gala has the best solo evars
8dari: isnt that obvious?
so did the nazis
LET'S NOT BRING WINTER CLOTHES FOR TEH LULZ
;)
4eww
but wwu is my favorite song
yeah, rainbowdash gala
rainbow poni is best poni
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
Gala has the best solos
Lol no :P i guess obsessed was to extreme of a word, do you like the sims a whole lot?
0APPLEJACK IS STILL BEST PONY
but Art of the Dress is the catchiest
Rainbow Dash's part of every song is the best
even though I don't really like Rainbow, dari is right here.
4And...hmm
@silverfish2 NOT HOW YOU SPELL RAINBOW DASH
thats not how you spell Rainbow Dash
thats not how you spell pinkie pie
rainbow dash's solo may have been the best thing on TV evar
Hipster_Brony: Yeah, but I like it over Winter Wrap Up.
:o
fluttershy and RD are the best
Buck apples eh?
Applejack ought to get one song of her own in Season 2 at least.
cool
8eh
SEASON TWO NEEDS A RD SOLO SONG BTW
niche audience Keiw? Hold on, I have to google some stuff
I think britain invaded russia too...
never really liked applejack
Winter wrap up and art of the dress are good,,, but I like cupcakes because it's the only song I've memorized completely
6Yeah..
WWU won the 'suprise song' award
0I love how Don Corleone is just staring at the fish while this is being dicussed
Nurgle, love you forever now
8i like Dash's verse on WWU more
4mfw the only "B" film I can think of is Freddy Got Fingered >.<
Applejack had the best part of WWU however
4But that's my choice
This movie needs to winter wrap up!
Was the light brigade english or french?
4WAIT
Heyyo!
8Elky: nope
4NO
No, I'm gonna agree that Dash had the best part in WWU
Cupcakes is easy to memorize
lol, that's because you like anything with Dash :P
Britain never *invaded* so much as bought all the banks and made it it's bitch
fawww ty israphel
and let the sunshine iiiin
0agreed Elky
4Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness
8AJ's verse on WWU wasn't very good IMO
Want me to give a suggestion?
6I basically have all the sims games on my computer..exept from the TS3 expansions..
hipster: anti-nope?
Russia is a british crypto-colony lol
4That's my "B" choice
lol
6o.o
Oh.
8weakest part of the song
xD
yeah AJ was kind of forgettable in WWU
@israphel all you gotta do is take a cup of flour
0AJ verse is best verse!
4Thanks guys
:(
Season two needs a Fluttershy song. About the length of AoTD at least.
but Twi's solo was fantastic in WWU
we move the clouds and we melt the white snoooow!
AJ NEEDS MOAR SONGS
Y U HATE ON AJ
0IT'S JUST SO MUCH TO DO~
true death
0APPLEJACK NEEDS MORE EVERYTHING.
Dash needs moar songs
lol, AJ just isn't a singing pony
We tamed the biggest country in the world
0Light Brigade was English
MONTAGE TIME
wat?
but season 1 had a fluttershy song
makes me prouder to be british
Because AJ and Twilight are worst ponies. :P
I just wanted to see BFE
Applejack does need more love in Season 2
0It should just be called the applejack show
Applejack needs more hats
or is there a video of her solo looped for ike an hour on youtube
1940S LAS VEGAS FTW!!!!!
See? Thats why i use obsessed
Oh man. MLP Newborn Cuties is pure evil excreted from satan's anus.
ikr
8disagree about twilight dari
0Led by Lord Cardington
uh, Ashleigh Ball is a singer actually...
oh shit, this is going to take a while
umm
But i like southern comfort applejack....
0I'm liking this idea.
AJ is second best pony
MLP newborn cuties
what are u smoking
DEAR GOD
WHY
WHYYYYY
0applejack needs more sentrys and dispensers
Applejack isn't really that loved is she.
APPLEJACK BEST PONY FLUTTERSHY SECOND BEST PONY RAINBOW DASH THIRD BEST PONEY
8twilight is my 2nd favorite, after Dash
I can't seem to like Pinkie too much, I suppose...
I'd like an AJ/RD duet in season 2
Season Two needs a Fluttershy song that takes up an entire span of time between commercials.
AJ is 2nd best pony fools
0I have no idea who my fave pony is
lots of people do not like rarity, i do not see why
hipster_brony knows his stuff
Rarity is best pony
No memorable episodes for applejack
easy
Purple pony is best pony.
:P
suddenly dancing
Sandvich Sandvich, Pinkie loves her Sandvich! tomatoes lettuce cheese and bread! Makes me strong to beat up Red!
The best two are Fluttershy and Rarity
SPRINKLES, Y U NO ANSWER?!
0Does anybody even like Rarity? She's kind of a bitch.
hipster knows wherof he speaks
Hi there, everypony!
pony pokey
FUCK YOU SEXYSQUIRT! Fluttershy is best pony.
She's a fabulous bitch though
I don't really like Twilight all that much.
DSNesmith knows what's good
+
6Yeah..You already knew what was coming.. :P
oops
I think he fell asleep.
0I like Rarity
8dari: nope
she's friggin adorkable though
TWILIGHT IS BEST PONY
1. Fluttershy (duh) 2. AJ -_-
6What's up?
Luna is best pony
I LOVE Rarity. I've got a pair of Rarity shot glasses coming in the mail this week.
0She's not my favourite though
deal with it
0One fabulous bitch.
twilight's? really? did you even look at Fluttershy?
Eeyup
heh.
7will you be around tomorrow?
6Icy grew up and is wearing a hat!
I thought I was gonna hate Rarity when I started watching
LUUUUNA
here's the pony debate
i like Twilight though =/
SEXY, NAUGHTY, BITCHY ME
RD#1, FS#2, AJ#3, PP#4, TS#5, Rarity#6
I wish Tara Strong recorded on sight with the others. I think the separation does hinder her voice work.
4lol
BRONIES Please, a little more love and tolerance please!
In order, it'd be Applejack, Rainbow Dash/Fluttershy (tie), Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Twilight Sparkle.
it took me maybe two episodes to love her
IF ANY OF THEM WERE REAL PEOPLE I'D DAT ANY OF THEM THOUGH
cheerilee is the best pony
LOL
0Twilight, Fluttershy, Dash and Pinkie are all tied for my top spot so far...
she's adorkable
THAT DAMN SONG IS STUCK IN MY HEAD
*on site
6Which I shall take off and make Icy hatless.
0What movie are we watching, guys?
Rainbow dash is always number one.
WHY DOES EVERYPONY HATE RARITY?
0OH NO
who?
give me abreak
0I used to like Fluttershy until she became popular.
Applejack is my favorite because im southern just like her
0ZOMBIE PONIES
Rarity is awesome
FLAMES AWAY
0RARITY IS BEST PONY
0Rarity is epitome of BITCH
@combustiblelemons brohoof

Singed_Iz_Brony, we are no longer comrades
fluttershy cuts it close for second place
0SPIKES WORST NIGHTMARE
0AK IS BLAND

8Prison: The Godfather
raritys personality is so overused
0AJ
Israphel Swap AJ and TS.
Rarity is bestpony!
Lyra is best Pony
Pinkie pie is sad now
we're making lists?
Because she should be called Vanity, that's why.
0There's something sexy about a southern accent
*brohoofs nah*
applejack is best pony, quit your joking
sweetie belle
Fluttershy is best pony
I PLANNED THIS PARTY FOR YOU!
ah, i think he just left for the store
0Hipster_Brony, I love this movie
HOORAY FOR ACCORDIAN

Srake?! Hey Srake! SRAAAAAAAAKE
which is why RD is the worst -_-
ugh
0I was amazed when Seth said she was best earth pony
SNAP
No, I'm trying to play Dungeons of Dredmor
Razyn: You're right, that was a lie, Rainbow Dash isn't just best pony, she's the best thing in existence. :>
TROLOLOLOLOLO
Caramel is best fucking pony period
It is impossible for anyone to say 'Good Eye Might' out loud without sounding Australian
6Basically now he's wearing this other thing instead..
nopony is the worst!

LOL
they're all great!

ValtheJean: I see what you did there.
0Has anyone else played the Godfather game?
it's just boring, the same every time and the urge to take part is nearly overwhelming
but Rarity is more equal than others
fanon depictions of the mane 6 are better anyway
My love for Rarity is like middle of the road
Dancers kick your tongues out? That sounds awful

MY WAY THOUGH.,
I'd bust her boast, if you know what I'm sayin
CREDITS ALL UP IN YO GRILL

so... cut the credits and move on?
Battlefield: Earth is not a bad movie.
I enjoyed this movie. Bronies, I am disappoint.
0The Godfather 2 is what we should be talking about, that was good
4:20am, i gonna hit the hay
0HURRY, STREAM BIG TITS AT SCHOOL

Skip the credits
THE CREDITS JUST HAPPEN TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE MOVIE
I'd battlefield her earth, if you know what I mean and I think you do
Wesley, are you in here? It's Nich
The credits provide the storyline
3:20am here
RAINBOWLOON
0Love to stay, but I gotta get ready for Ai-Kon tommorow
wil battlefield earth be with rifftrax?
Is anyone still learning how to SPELL THEIR NAME?!?!
it proabably wasn't boring, but it was more like watching a movie with firends who can't shup up. Of course you're going to focus on the chatting...
so what pony-sode is next?
Battlefield Earth was awesome as far as I remember
@ghosties: NO U
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK

good night to all of you who are leaving
It's sad that we as bronies justify FiM as being well written and amazingly produced, yet get butthurt at the sight of classic cinema
4We have to watch the credits? ¯\(°_o)/¯
Exactly
I LIVE ON WEST COAST
/me prepares his rocket lawnchair for the lottery.

InsertCupcakes enjoys great success
4Guitarbuddy449, no colors please
I'm not sure what you mean, InsertCupcake
DONT WORRY CERDITS MADE BEFORE 1980 WERE SHORT
Holla holla get dolla
The credits music is great at least.
TECHNICOLOR! FUCK YEAH
I'm rather disappointed to see that showing this movie made more haters than fans
so gone with the wind you be okay with y'all?
The Godfather starts very slowly, and introduces a lot of completely uninteresting characters (like Michael's first wife, and Sonny) just to kill them off. Frankly, the first two hours could be shaved down to one without losing very much.
NewDCD is the broadcaster.
I will go insane if I win the lottery
IT IS DONE
SOUTH COST ZIGGAS!
oh he's gone.
UPDATE THAT HP
Rainbow dash attack while i waiT? i think so!
This had the worst music of any movie ever
