I saw a show once where they set up people for worse stuff than that (I think anyway). They made them think they were sort of in a horror film scenario.
ew, what now?
7Because she first said she hates lugia.us, and now she hates squiby.
7(Apparently, they banned her.)
ew
squiby?
One of them two people were driving along in a car.
02LOL, hater gonna hate?
7She hates websites that ban her?
One of them was in on it, the driver.
wow
7I'm slowly making progress with her.
02at this rate she'll get banned from every forum in the internet xD
And they stopped the car for some reason, then an actor made to look like an 'alien' ripped the car door off (I suppose it was rigged beforehand), and took the driver away.
i hope so....someway....

Yep.

so therefore
Lol, well she was watching it and told me to watch it.
weren't you basically just curious what was so great about it?
yeah, pretty much
I kept seeing it everywhere
I thought it looked cute but there was no way half the internet could like it and not be trolling
hm, maybe everyone who likes it is trolling
and there are only a few who actually like it
are you guys trolling?
nope
but if I was, would I be likely to tell you?
I feel like it's just something that is a guilty pleasure for all those people

no such thing as a guilty pleasure

12Who is Soap?
Soap, throw a flashbang through the door!
Soap whatever it is you're planning do it fast!
12I just said soap because it was sounding like "so"
Soap ready for MW3?
03this movie is so awesome
Soap, what sort of name is that? How'd a muppet like you pass selection?
03it's kinda bizarre but XD
02LOL MW3
02It will suck
12Soapity soap soap from Soaptown, Soapaina
the teaser did :|
02Same game, another place, same guns, diferent skins.
but yeah dont say it'll suck just cos its popular to hate COD now
03also TIME PARADOXES AAHHHHHH
12huh
03this is now like my third time watching this movie and there are still things I never noticed before
03I have a friend over and we're watching a movie
03called Déjà Vu
02actualy I just hate it because of Activision
true
they did kill off Guitar hero
02They have closed almost every other game seccion
02If CoD fails, they are done
I guess the topic is the same as EA and command & Conquer/Red alert
02^
one thing is for sure though, BF3 is looking epic and will challenge COD
but yeah I've loved COD since the first game on PC, the love for that followed my love for MOH: Allied Assault
02It's fun just to sit, watch the flame wars, and then see how the Companies close. :3
yeah
12This topic. O_o
02.-.
but I've always enjoyed cod, and I cannot understand why a lot of ppl hate it now although now I can understand the reasons stated cos of activision etc
12I know what happens at the end of COD: black ops heh
same here
or starlit are you talking about the intel where even if you find some parts are still censored?
INTEL INSIDE
:3
cos I have feelings theories about that
And I hate CoD
So boo
13Cod is a fish
13:<
02^
02CS 1.6 > almost every CoD
HML did you play the first and second games?
or the exp pack to the first?
02and wait.. CS is around 10 years old
02so that's actually funny :3
No
I never played them
Since FPS are mostly Ew
02Also Changing Topic...
02Starlit how's your new PC? :3c
well then, honestly if you didn't play COD 1, 2 and MW1 you won't know those games MP and SP are actually really good
I agree recent times MP has become hacked and cheap

what happened what quan?

hey
I was helping Evan get ePSXe working
what's that?
LOL I think Starlit sent me an HD Pic of her XD
Never done it myself, so I consider that an accomplisment
12When?
12Ohhh
mhm
12@HML shut up
It's a psx emulator
psx?
12give drf the picture
12and he'll make it 3D for you
We're playing Spyro the Dragon on it

Ignore them Starlit XD
oh, so like ps1
ah
that's cool
12I think I will.
I found a website that legally sells some game music that is hard to find elsewhere

sadly Spyro was not on it

I feel smart too
while you were gone I was insulting an AI
and arguing with it
7Oh, Nick, you just returned from /away. *late*

Did you know you could actually put PSX games in a computer's CD drive?
I had no idea until just now
woah, no I did not
but it works
o-o
but then again, I didn't even know it was abbreviated PSX
I always just thought it was just PS
7 18:10:21		--- Nick is back
It's PS1 or PSX
PSX is the old one, I think
02@Starlit: Ram is abbreviation of Random Access Memory, a virtual memory to store data temporarily. The more ram you have, the faster your PC will be.

take out your current drive, and boot from damnsmalllinux
?
02Thx Quan :3 [/late]
how will that help me? I will be screwed when I go to turn off my computer
on*
plug your dick drive back in
and burn damnsmalllinux on there
a disk, and put it on there*
is that even safe to insert it while the netbook is powered on?
cant you turn it off and back on?
I can, but the Ubuntu partition I reformatted without thinking, meaning the grub loader is all jacked up to the point of being non-Existent, meaning it will not let me boot to anything, even my livedisk USB drive will not work
so I need to completely wipe and reformat the HDD
Cant you still boot from acd?
a cd*
netbook
no disc drive
do you have a USB one?
I HAD the ability to boot from USB till I killed the grub loader
...WTH
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130541238329.jpg
no
but I imagine I would face the same issue
It shouldn't be about either. xD
Hmm
Dari, what the heck is that?
O_o
Looks like a Hello Kitty vibrator to me.
that is a flashlight I think
that or the kitty spins around or something
I don't think so, Lam.
no?
Where would the light come from?
Lol.
It spins around all right... it's part of the vibration. xd
maybe the kitty glows
And you are on ubuntu rught now?
or there's an led at the other end, I dunno
/me just showered :3
Could be.
It's dark in there, you know.
Apparently "this thing is for oral use".
O_o
I'm on Kubuntu :3
Of... course...?
06Kosoveon what
what I want to know is why anyone would be posting that in the first place
Im on lubuntu
Actually no
ha
It's a plastic-flavored lollipop.
What I /don't/ want to know
>_>
Someone said they got a MLP flashlight.
no, I am on Windows. Ubuntu shall not touch my rig
So someone said they got an MLP fleshlight.
Then someone posted that.
no, I mean what is the computer booted into?
ew
...
pay attention
/definitely not going to ponychan anymore
Lawl, the music owned your computer.
Yeah =.
*=/
GRUB loader= dead. Grub loader is what allowed me to boot into anything once I slapped a second OS on there.
This is why Dari's rep is far too smeared to run in this race we're having/
ok, but right now the comp is on or off?
haha
He'd have about as much of a shot as Ron Paul.
and what is it booted into if its on
that and he's british
The_People can't handle me.
IT BOOTS INTO NOTHING YOU INCOMPETENT OAF!
Well, overlooking exclusionary reasons.
*English
so arti, does dis mean that the forum will link back to this chat or ?
without the grub loader, i cannot select my Windows OS partition, and therefore I cannot boot into anything, just an error message and a command line prompt
At least we don't have many limits on it, unless you count Internet Killswitch.
And a healthy dose of CP, courtesy of 4chan.
Lol.
7Oh, wait:
7Articuno?
Ok, so I dont get why you cant boot from a USB stick?
I dont get why either. All it does is give me one line of text, which ends in copyright info
take out the bios battery, and put it back on
in*
...
I love that "WOAH-OH-OH-AH-AH-AH-AH-HA-AH-AH" thing.

12hmmm?
Yeah, that was awesome. XD

Wow, sounds loud.
I hope it got it right

12who here thinks the new migration game is dumb?

12i like pal park more
12you couldn't fail at palpark XD
7Pal Park's much too lengthy (I think).
03!shipping
12but if you miss a pokemon in the new game then you have to remigrate it with even more pokes
06!shipping
7Or you could just focus on that one pokemon to catch and wait.
7But the game's pretty easy.
7It's more timing than anything.
Hey dari
Yeah?
7BBL.
I clicked on your computer-killing link
and it didn't kill my computer
D:
:P
:D
Well it was just the song.
Lol
And you said that killed your computer last time. :P
It must've developed a tolerance...
Actually I think the bluescreen happened because I was trying to muffle the sound under a pillow and it overheated
XD
XD
Lol.
LOL
Fail.
and it IS a netbook :P
yep
Why would you even resort to that?
because it was really loud and I couldn't get the volume control to work
so while I waited for the volume control to come up I was trying to make it shut up
Forced shutdown would have made you lose something?
nah, she just didn't think loud music was worth a forced shut down I'm sure :P
Haha, but it was worth smothering with a pillow?
I only did it for a few seconds at a time and hoped it wouldn't overheat
/me dies her hair blonde
um. an unallocated partion can't be deleted
just spnding to much time with a pollock such as myself maybe
:P
Homophones, lol.
Yeah she is, isn't is dye? :P
it's just that: space that hasn't been allocated to a partition
dingdingding.
seriously though I probably wouldn't even have thought of the computer overheating
I was afraid it might but figured it wouldn't if I didn't do it for too long <.<
Computer overheats I R KNOW PUT IN WASSER TO CALL IT DOWN
That is pretty weird. But you said it was a netbook, and those thing swill heat up at the drop of a hat in my experience.
yes
*things will
dip it into a bucket of wasser
:D
WASSER IZ ONLY QURE
I'm not that stupid, dari
XD
13Is there anyone here who would be willing to part with a Reshiram that they might happen to have?
my sister tried drowning our cat when we were little
Stupid? That sounds like legiimate advice.
Maybe StormBlond is.
*legitimate
lol
13I've been wanting one for a while now, but since I have White it's pretty much impossible for me to get one on my own |D
my stupid doppelganger has a name!
she dunked it into a plastic golf bag (headfirst) and held it there
Using that instead of legitimate in future. XD Awesome.
plasmatic, that is all
It looks like it's a Latin cognate, so roll with it if you like.
how do you pronouce that? legi-i-ment?
Lay-gee-mit.
*mate
I was about to comment on the -ment. :P
legi'imet
kinda figured that
like when people say ma'am
instead of madam
gonna have to extend my current partition into it though, that unallocated space will drive me nuts
That's for a different reason, but if it helps you sound it out, that works.

10There may be an event for Zekrom/Reshiram in the future
10Since in Japan, they're having downloads of them in movie 14th's premiere
XDDDDD
What the heck
what is the context for that?
Brock finally got sick of Ash dragging him everywhere
it has to make more sense with context
I mean really
I have a comic that makes it make sense
Nope, Brock rapes Ash in the actual episode. :P
oh, I thought he threw him into the air
the camera panned up and all
Dari's right. In the uncut Japanese version he just rapes Ash.
O.o
13Yeah I originally told myself I'd wait for an event or for a 3rd game (Assuming both legendaries can be caught should a 3rd game be released) but a small part of me has started to become a bit impatient xD
I don't believe you
Inflatable boobs James still gets me. So funny.
They don't speak of it again on their journey for obvious reasons.
@_@
Pikachu saw, though, and is slowly consumed by survivor's guilt.
ah yeah, he's trolling
How am I trolling?
The Pikachu part was a joke, but the rest...
what episode was that?
I'm bulbapedia'ing it
I'm not sure. I'll look as well.
How the heck did that make it here when an episode with Jynx was banned because of "racial stereotypes"?
I can't remember, you need to look up the Japanese name.
"Brock is considered the most mature, wise and level-headed of the main characters, and he is arguably the most intelligent character as well."
NO HE'S NOT
if this is true
Well, they're all basically morons.
So I guess in a relative light he is.
I've fooled them with things more farfetched than this.
I'm very good at rhetoric. Plus, they're more prone to believe it psychologically if we both say the same story.
this is the name of a quiz I stumbled accross
"Can you name the Brock's Pokemon?"
the Brock
Have you never wondered how he got his name?
no, I have not
Ash is fairly normal, if it's short for Asher.
Misty sounds like a stripper name, but nonetheless normal.
Misty May!
What's not normal about Brock in comparison?
I feel like I've known a Brock before
Well, Brock Lesner is a UFC fighter.
And a douchebag.
That's such a terrible name, everyone'd think you're a pornstar.
Right? xD
Although some of these volleyball and tennis players might as well be.
Lol.
Ash gets turned into a Pikachu? Creepy.
that one I remember
Lol, Misty is a man.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxeajNHLTz8&feature=related
It's so funny that people analyze these episodes.
that's what fandoms do
I know, I know. That's probably why they're so entertaining to watch.
if you think that's bad you should see the MLP fanbase, where apparently two female ponies are married and have a daughter together because they were standing next to each other in one episode
:P
LOL
Hahahahaha.
XDDD seriously?
yes
completely serious
wooooow
That sounds reasonable to me.
03!shipping
That's even worse than conspiracy theorists.

is it so important to love lamp?
we were friends... until I found out you loved lamp
or is it better to hate lamp?
If you can't tolerate my lifestyle of loving lamp, then I can't tolerate you.
me, I meh lamp
Is it better to fear or love lamp?
That's what Machiavelli asks.
Is that from Anchorman? I haven't seen it, my friends say it's funny, but it sounds stupid.
it is. To both
from anchorman: yes
It is, and it's an okay movie if you can overlook Will Ferrell's small, annoying qualities.
anchorman is stupid: yes
I love the flick, but I'll admit it's stupid.

I'm a sucker for surreal comedy.
I still can't get over this huge rift you've made by denying your human instinct of loving lamp.

02Betoo~
02Haven't seen you in a good time :3
/me randomly noms on Altair
Heya Quil
whats up?
Not much, just a little pissed off with a few friends of mine
ah. :/
Mm bad times
On a plus side I finally mastered every combat skill on Mabi
04meow
wow. gratz
awwweee
<3
12oh wait
Total level is now over 1500 XD
I wanna solo peace >:(
Peaca*
<.>
12solo peaca hard mode when it comes out
You can't solo Peaca
12sure you can
12you enter with people then everyone leaves
You HAVE to be in a party of 4+ to even enter it
12just ask 3 people to join with you then leave when they enter
Hard Mode Rundal is bad enough
Already tried that
Everyone wants to do Peaca
Especially with a pro -.-
12find some noobs then that won't even leave a dent
Done that
None of them quit
12who cares if they quit they are so bad it's like they don't even exist there lol
I want the EXP/Rewards to myself
3 alts
12your total level is 1500, share some glory
Umbreon, Peaca is the hardest dungeon, even at my total I will more than likely die alot
12i know
and Dialga, you CAN'T use Alt's on Mabi, unless you have more than 1 comp
In my case I have 1 comp
Well 2
acquire 3 more computers
-.-
KITTEN!
:D
Solo'ing Hard Mode Alby Intermediate is no longer fun
Trying to get a Alby Adv pass
Bloody things are hard to come by :|
only one exlamation point eh
*exclamation
hehe
i be sleepy
shameful
there was like 8 when he said my nick
<3
:P
Ciar Advanced Hard Mode solo is fun
XD
I only get one, and not even all caps
</3
I don't even get a greeting :<
Notce how I was first :
12i did an intermediate once
12that was enough
Alby Advance is a pain in normal modes
Hard Mode of it though
Hmm
Not sure, not tried it yet
Not had the pass
12i just have no talent for the game
yesh
well, a lot more than one
Well having R1 on all Combat skills
and Beast Lord to boot
I can one shot every enemy in Ciar Adv (Including the boss)
hehe
well then thats fine by me too
One shotting Ogre Warriors is fun too
Though one thing that is making my laugh so hard right now
My brother is playing Mabi (total level isn't even 150 yet)
And he thinks he could beat me in a PVP
I'm wearing full Colin Plate Armour with a Lava Cat Robe
HP is 462, MP is 231, Stam is 631
And I have Beast Lord
Hmmmmmmm
:O
back
Anyway I'm off, mastering blacksmithing
XD
laa
my comp just got constipated there
it just shut down
and I was like wtfff
dwaggy
kawaii!
^________^
dari's gonna look at his irc and realize we're both muted
;p
:P
:(
and where <3
HAHAHAHA
XD
Dude!
I know how to make him auto ignore himself
:o
12!shipping
YES
WIN
:3
?
:P
whenever he says that
which is essentially dari ignoring himself
that is all, I just got a little overexcited :P
sudo apt-get purge apache* && sudo apt-get install apache
I killed the spare comp :(
I think
I know I screwed something up quite badly when I reinserted the RAM
meh, no worries though, twas an old Athlon I Emachines
just sucks that I have to now Build a new comp for my gf, rather than fix the old one up and give it to her
meh
I guess
just get a cheap one off ebay
but I got this one for free, and it was borderline suitable
just needed more RAM and a dedicated GPU
I gues
mmm squishy
/me hugs back
hey!
orly
:)
12hi
I am trying to get into shape
xD
<late>
hmm, is 2 gigs enough for a person who really just expects to play Sims 3 on her desktop, and little of anything more taxing?
hai
12how goes
nope
?
sims 2 will like rape the hell out of those 2gb
you will need more, for that game alone
plus to have windows on it?
damn
If you put xp on there, maybe 2.5 will be fine
windows 7? at least 3.5/4
k
does not matter what speed though, right?
semi-decent
yous?
12feathery x-x
Hmm, I know little about integrated graphics
back
hmm
The Sims 3 would do fine with 3GB of ram on windows 7
but it likely won't play nice with integrated graphics unless like, all the settings are at minimum
Cat: think of all the background processes
if I am going over 2 gigs, it is generally cheaper to get the full 4
yeah, go for 4
yeah, go for that
background processes should be minimal, will be a clean install
is it 32-bit or 64-bit windows?
32bit
definitely
why?
well, if I am building it, will def be 64 bit
why?
64-bit is more futureproof?
obvious compatability
issues*
it means you can use more than 3.5GB of ram
bah
I've been using 64-bit operating systems for nearly 3 years now
I guess.
I have yet to encounter any compatibility issues
and I generally don't come up with compatibility issues
12wb ecco
and any 32 bit programs seem to get their own folder
meh, thats why there is compatability mode
o_O
yeah, they do
and the one I did come up against was with unsupported starforce DRM drivers for an old game
64-bit can still run 32-bit programs
C;\programfiles(86)
thank you Umbreon.
I cannot think of a single reason to not get a 64-bit these days
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138294
this might work
12yay i'm umbreon :)
not futureproof though
/me doesn't poof into a dolphin
other than perhaps if you have an ancient cpu that doesn't support 64-bit
And I think my internet may crash on me again
but if that's the case, why are you buying a new OS rather than a new CPU
12D:
http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138294
xD
that is a pretty cheap motherboard
look at the price difference between us and canada
does it only have 2 ram slots? D:
I have never bought a micro-ATX motherboard
Cat: I have 8000000000000000000000000000 ram slots
shut up
I have a normal ATX motherboard at the moment
next one would be nice if it was extended-ATX, preferably with SLI support
I have a motherboard that I got with my comp
its fine for now.,
you probably have 4 ram slots
that's the most common amount
I have 2
Micro-ATX is a good board, but most certainly is hell to work with when you get it in a micro-ATX case
what cpu are you using?
hi ecco
and that sucks :(
I upgraded the pc at home to have a 2.9GHz Athlon II X2
;o
hey Kosovo, and, I think it is okay. But we'll see.
/me stabs Altair
and for the graphics card I used an Nvidia GT240
basically all my old parts :P
Cat: who was your question directed at?
02Ohai NS
k
02also, FUUUU-- Cliff Racer ;__;
if thats how it is now
true
I have a 2.8ghz dual core intel
that's not too bad
I am upgrading to an intel p4
3.6ghz
anyways, prolly any one of the AM3 CPU's
upgrading to a P4?
yeah
that is a really stupid idea
why?
P4s are ancient
yeah
I have a Pentium D atm
xD
heya
p4 is the most my cpu will support
get a new motherboard, then?
I dont have money
02I got killed by at least a swarm of 7 of those
and yet you're upgrading the cpu?
and Im getting a new computer in september anyways
well don't waste your money upgrading this one then
shell out the 385 needed to build a foot in the door system and call it a day
hi
Cat: I need just this upgrade.. my comp barely runs with the processor I have now
the PC itself might be 6 years old, but the tech inside is likely 7-10
And I dont have money
Well, I do
but I am saving up for a dedi
offshore
why?
I cant get a job here, legally
till next year
so :(
._.
ohai MtChar|Sleep
nope

im sleeping
yepp
can't you even do a paper round or something?
yeah
but that pays like 4 times less than minimum wage
12how do i DC the jumper on TST?
its like $10/day
and I have to work for like 2 hours
minimum wage here is $10.50/hr
5 dollars an hour doesn't so bad
and it's not like you're paying bills
I need to be
I worked for a year at minimum wage
$10.50 an hour is minimum wage?
it was hell
12jkkjjjkjkjjkjjjjjjjjkkkjkkjjkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjk
It's only $7.25 here
12whoops
Cat: meh, I guess.
That seems like a lot to me
10.50?!
Holy crap
Yeah
it was £5.80 when I was working
I know right?
its gonna go up to $12.50 soon
I just got a RAISE for 8.50
It's like $14 here
oh wait, canadian dollars, right?
ohhhhh
that would explain it
XD

Anyone want to share a dedi server?
I found the adventurecraft mod today.. started making a map
Hm?
pick a whole number between 1 and 180
:D

12http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=af4d9e7e820df463e9ea609921ec4aa9
what do you even want a dedicated server for?
server stuff
xD
hm
I'm sure you have better things to be spending your money on if your pc is apparently so crappy
:O
oh. survival classic?
12no free browser version
/me hides
my vps: $25/mo - 3GB ram
XD
dedi: $70/mo 16GB ram
is the amount of ram important to a server?
o.O
oh wow.. v0.30
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
that's.. absurdly old
oh right, is it for online gaming?
I would not imagine so, unless a lot of applications would be run on it
/me stabs and buries Cat
/me has a lot of applications runnign
plus, it has a quad core
if all it were handling was just some content and a lot of traffic, then the CPU and HDD speeds would be more important
processor
and I need the HDD space
3TB
:D
for $70 a month, you could have a decent HDD and a quad core in your own pc
o.O
yeah
my classic server is better
look up Icy Pond
Cat: My mobo doesnt support that
motherboards are cheap?
classic is boring too
meh
no creepers
I got mine, a really quite decent one with support for loads of stuff, for about £60
I was hoping SDK would update his mod
even though i own the game
not micro ATX or anything
70 a month is $840 dollars. for that you could build one high end gaming machine, or 1 mid range high traffic high capacity server
meh
but I dont have a 100mbit connection
in fact, I have a 25/1 connection
and that costs about $70/mo
oh, the hirony

I'm still confused as to who t7f is
I'm not sure about lamp.

Lol.
Dari: To remain neutral is to be an enemy of lamp, and all it stands for.
Lu: me too
I'm confused about who a lot of people are on here lately
02o-o?
If you are not with lamp, then you are lamp's enemy!
and I proudly declare myself

To anyone who's interested, I'm going to make a slideshow viewer for e621. What will it do? It will take search terms and look for them. After compiling a list of results you can slideshow your results very cleanly. Note: I am not good with visual stuff. Do not expect me to make this have amazing visual effects!

12you stole me? i belong to you
o_O
12..
D:
12what
12why is it double lining
idk
XD
12it's the same exact code as the other ownership
hmm
what?
uh
you could have 2 of the same scripts
which you do
12then how come when you do a /ctcp say for isukra it doesn't double line as well?
you need to change the variables
12i did
and well
you should only have one script
so it's like
12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %kranick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
12vs
12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %espynick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
that should work
12you saw the resuls
12*results

12Hiya ^^
well try
12hi
12when did you get that wb message
ctcp *:say:*: { if ($nick == %kranick) { /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ ) } elseif ($nick == %espynick) { msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ ) } }
that should work but it'll fuck up if the nick is in both vars
12A very long time ago lol!
heya Articuno

so fucking hard to summon
:3
12when was the last time i talked to you about the pokemon tcg lol
Stardust assault is the most pain
oh god
also Stardust Assault is't really hard to get out :(
just use a Dragunity deck
ew dragunity
basically go
Dragon ravine yadda yadda get Dragunity Phalanx in grave
Dragunities are boring
summon dux into vaj into stardust Drop Assault beast or AMA stardust assault
get a real dragon deck plz
i run Vayu Turbo :P
fucking powerful
but hard to get out :P
lightsworns got fucked by the TCG rules
yeah it's hard to get out
needs 1 tuner + 2
yeah
Blizzard from the far north~
that card is nice
and then you have bora + gale combo
due to kalut
being at 1
kalut :x
Army
the best combo is
Sirrc + bora
which one was sirrc? ;x
use sicc into bora -3700 beaststick piercing
OH
the 2 k normal summon one
that card
lmaaaao
you summon sicc first
then summon gale and bora
ss bora
or lots of boras :P
I once had someone
best part is when
Black whirlwind
normal sicc
add bora
:x
speical 3 boras
gale
LOL black whirlwind
:x
card is overpowered I swear
so you have
so you technically have then
8400 piercing
on field
enough for game :(
pretty much
or you could use sircc's effect
then icarus attack
and then fuck your opponent with that
I never use that card
:x
also
Thought Ruler Archfiend <3
favourite character is still Sayer
:x
:P
have to admit my frav card is stardust
heh
oh yeah

04?
I think I got Rex's name from that guy :x
04huh
Guess I can just bookmark that link then
which link?
:O
The link to the irc chat?
ah, okay
Nothing exciting, I'm afraid
I'm really hungry D:
not sure whether to make something now, or to wait until the chippy opens and go there
Fish and chips?
yes
I am going to prepare noodles for now
I will still get zeh chips laters
Where do you live, UK?
yes
near Birmingham
What do you use for condiment there? Malt vinegar?
Everything here is tartar sauce and cole slaw. : /
Southerners put cole slaw on everything. I swear
salt and vinegar are common
also, curry sauce, gravy, mushy peas or baked beans
coleslaw is usually more a fried chicken thing here
My grandfather loves crab cakes with beans. Don't think I've ever seen curry sauce though
I'm hungry now, going to have fried eggs and kielbasa
have fun
kielbasa is sausage, right?
Yeah

/me throws a mallet at Kyu
/me then idles
12o-o
f this
hammertime!
...still not a good idea to turn my highlights on for that
hopefully it stopped :x
/me turns highlights back on

it's so I can actually see whether I'm getting attacked somewhere :x
because usually I don't look in places

*cough*
ohai
it's the amazingly awesometastic world of IRC, blaphmat 8D
welcome to the...world of IRC
WHUUUUU?
xD
I DON'T EVEN
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
4IRC?
yet, possible
It somehow exists in our silly little virtual reality ;(
Does that mean that we have turtles? :D
slow people? yes ;3
YAAAAAAAAAY
12Hi blaphmat
*cough* By the way, this is Dragon. Rainbow Dragon. Rainbow Dash.
12^^
12Which one of those is your username on TST?
Oh, wait. Currently, I'm "My Little Bronie"
Oh
hi Dark Dragon
12Lol ^^
you could try /nick iamanarsehat
Yay, someone who remembers meh.
;p
Cool.
12I remember you too ^^
12I've seen you on the forums
12is this your first time here by the way?
Yeah, I've been on the forums. Yes, this is the first time here.
13:3
derpdragon
I just clicked on a random link within the forums, on a topic about Mibbit, so in the event that the site is down... How do I get here?
uh
You can download a real client...?
like mIRC or X-chat
I believe drf has a pre-configured mIRC for use
... And I am going to try that. Maybe.
don't know where it went :x
/me ish back
http://www.mirc.com/
you can download mIRC from there I think
02when did I ping'd?
and hi Ray
uh
6 minutes ago
Sup, Ray.
02hmm..
02Kthx~
;o
13Darkdragon, are you able to go on wifi on your DS right now?
02Also, Hiya DarkDragon~
13Because if you can, we could finally do those trades that we've been meaning to do for a while now xD
Eh.... My mother actually took it away because I was watching flips in the middle of the night, and apparently I'm not gonna get it back for a while. Very sorry. Could you wait a bit longer, Espe?
13Ah right xD
13Yeah it's fine :3
derp mums.

okay internet, die in a fire
02^
...and now it works.
BECAUSE IT IS NOT VIOLENT
wtf.
xD
and lol I happen to be writing an essay on violence right now
12By the way, does anyone here know how to change the colour of the table around your profile..?
12I think I did a long time ago but forgot how
WHICH IS ILLEGAL
Yeah
12If you look at my profile in the Shadow Lugia theme, it's the dark ppurple bit :/
12lol
it's windowbg1 or windowbg2
can't remember
/me checks
12Really? I have that set I thought
12I thought those were the middle bits
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANTING
oh wait
it is
13there's a topic with Help and Feedback section with the code, isn't there?
12Lol ^^ me too
12But I couldn;t find the topic!!
.tborder
maybe
So, does everyone act silly on here, or is it just meh?
http://pastebin.com/p4ZSh7fA
/me burbs "nah, it's just you"
12Depends what you mean by silly I guess
that's the pastebin for my profile @ Articuno
just you, Darkdragon?
are you saying I'm not silly?
I'm offended, idiot.
here we go again....
>:(
derp
That's what I am.
12Your profile has lots of stuff on it..
12Hi Pattyrick ^^
look who's here!
I mean, hi. =D
Hi Arti.
hm
Oh, hi, pat
12tborder didnt fix it :(
Hi Dark Dragon.
if it isn't our Orange loving italian Pat
12It's still purple on the Shadow Lugia theme,
Hm
xD
12I'd like it to be either white or transparent or something
/me thinks that perhaps that's not a good thing...
is it titlebg, Articuno?
02[/reference]
and it's white on the Articuno/Lugia theme
12I have titlebg set
12If anyone visits my profile using the SL theme it is purple and rubbish
Ah
try table { transparent; }
I can't wait until the DOL theme comes to the forum.
12Sorry just testing something
uh
table { background-color: transparent; }
DOL?
/fail
and heya rye
DOL?
Deep Ocean Lugia
oh lol
12I already have
12table {
12background-color:transparent;
12}
12Lol ^^;
ah
Oh, cool.
newsbar?
Really! =D Let me check it out.
12I could try newsbar I ghuess
That's what the maintenance was for yesterday.
don't think it'd be newsbar though
or menubar
So, now what?
/me isn't sure what Pattyrick is talking about
I think he's talking about a new theme :x
that you may or may not make in the future
:x
Wait, it's not on the forum yet.
12I think he's confused..
12Ovo
or try table.newsbar { if newsbar doesn't work
yeah :x
12Who told you I made a DOL theme for the forum?
The Deep Ocean Lugia theme is on the main site, but not on the forum.
Who made it then?
<Pattyrick> I can't wait until the DOL theme comes to the forum.
12No one did
Eh, we could use a new theme. Or better yet, make the Ho-oh temple theme actually work on the forum. It's pretty awesome.
/me is also confused.
I'm confused now
12Who said anyone made the theme? ovO
o_O
0-o
12D:
So... #waffles
Likes waffles.
/me likes pancakes even more, though.
but yeah, Articuno, does table.newsbar/newsbar work?
That was experimental. I guess.
Man, how do you do that?
So was Fermi's nuclear reactor.
Ah
I haven't done the CSS for ages :x
just did it and then left it
12I did it ^^
I feel very silly/hyper right now.
02it's a side effect of the chat
welcome to the club Darkdragon
02you'll get used to it
02:3
^
12You need all three of these I think
12.tborder {
12background-color:transparent;
12border-color:transparent;
12}
12td[style] {
12background-color:transparent !important;
12}
12tr[style] {
12background-color:transparent !important;
12}
oh, I thought you had the td[style] :x
That, or it was the pop rocks and Mnt dew I just chugged.
12hehehehe ^^
does anyone actually believe
yeah it was
12Maybe ^^;
12It's a possibility
personally I think she's 11
even I didn't act like that
and I was bad enough
she's not insane
have you ever seen any of my ooooooold posts?
I'm sure Articuno remembers
and not to mention my posts in the spam topic :x
Well, not much, anyway. Sometimes, I just want to give up on her and just let her do whatever she wants.
But I am reliable.

"15. 	Anti Bot: Are You Human/Bot?"
12I could update it but I had to manually install it so I don't know if it'll work

I got bored
oh
well I installed it via the SMF system
12It's complicated.. long story too

12probably due to the manual install ^^

Same here
Try SNES
it has 4 buttons
Plus 4 more
:P
speaking of snes I just watched some vids of starfox 2 a while ago
that game looked pretty good
actually no rephrase that, impressive
May I rephrase again?
sure
:
;D
I know that dragon at the start woah
plus I always wanted to know who the two new characters were
Do you have/want the translation patch/rom :P
what emulator do you need for it?
ocs I was aware someone actuallly remade the whole thing for release
I wish someone would do that with Resi Evil 1.5
:OO
cheeseex: !!!
o.o
Not entirely remade
But either SNES9x
Or Zsnes (EW, I perfer SNES9x when it works XD)
Dear New Running Partner,
Hello! My name is Mustafi Chukwuemeka Adetokunbo, but my friends call me Wuemeka. I have just moved to Philadelphia from Kenya and I too am looking for a running partner. I run for twelve miles every morning, and another eight at night. I now run a 4 minute mile. I know this is slow, but no worry, I am aiming to run a 3:50 mile by next month. I most look forward to running with you, my new friend! Please respond with your contact information a
nd where you would like to run. I am not so acquainted with Philadelphia, but I would prefer to run in densely forested areas if you know of any.
Oh, so in your drunken stupor you decided it would be a good idea to wake up my entire family at 3:30 in the morning? I have my computer hooked up to a 7.1 surround sound system, and Outlook plays a sound every time I receive an e-mail. It damn near rattled the house when you sent it. You woke up our three month old baby and now he is crying.
I have a meeting with some big-time clients today, and now I am going to be falling asleep in the meeting. Thanks a lot, douchebag.
I don't like your attitude, pal. First you wake up my entire family, and now you curse me out? This is unacceptable. By the way, my wife was so distraught from you waking her up that she accidentally microwaved our baby's milk too long. The baby was scalded with burning hot milk, and now we have to go to the hospital. I hope you are happy with yourself. Is this how you normally sell iPhones on the internet?
Mib ^.^
Cat: I have access to about twenty black widow spiders, and about 50 brown recluse spiders. For $200, I can release them at your party, and everyone can enjoy them. They are great for kids! I know a lot about insects from my job. I worked in an office on the first floor that had cheap windows, so I always had to kill bugs. I can tell you how to kill anything from a stink bug to an African burrowing scorpion. I can give a small speech to your p
arty about this.
Wow you could've just linked that
xD
But spamming is half the fun!
hello
T7F: !

xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
LMAO
/me explodes
lollll

/me waves to T7F
/me proceeds to wave to everyone else
T7F: xDDDDDDDDD
:D
$300 for a sims crushing machine for my gf
shame AGP cards cost so much, otherwise I would just try upgrading an older comp for cheaper
meh
I have a desktop
you can have it for like $20+shipping
lol, yeah, I have standards mate
lol
its not that bad
knowing you that desktop is likely running a 300MHz CPU
NO!
301MHz
xD
lawl
Its got like a 2GHz, actyually
think its dual core
20GB HDD INCLUDED!
how old is it?
a few years
It actually had a 120GB hdd
but I dropped it
and it no longer works
so I found the 20GB hdd
lol, I don't know why you don't use that desktop for yourself
because I have a better one
Pokemon Puzzle League was released in Germany apparently
If you dont want it, maybe I will use it
is there a thing so you can make your screen switch from one comp to another?
I forgot about that game
yes
a KVM switcher
not me
because when it comes to many aspects of Pokemon I am stuck in the past
:OO
How much is one of those?
not quite sure how they work, but essentially it acts like my HDMI switcher and allows you to plug in multiple computers to one hub, and from there you plug in your monitor, and typically your keyboard and mouse as well, and you are able to switch to whichever comp you need to with the press of a button
TV show, movies, music
hmm
thats cool
yeah, I know of someone who has one, just didnt know what they were called
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817107407
youtube has many great old pokemon ads
like the fat scary bus driver who drives a bus full of pokemon to a vehicle crusher
back when it was THE thing in the US
<(ϟϟ)>
the video games are not as popular as they used to be but still doing quite well
actually I always thought the pokemon games did amazingly well regardless
I think its the pop culture as a whole that isn't as big
already read it
http://dontevenreply.com/view.php?post=14
the TCG has always been big here in the UK too its still sold frequently in stores and about the only pokemon related item in toy stores
the trading card game is fading out in the US
video games are still strong
movies are fading out
TV show is fading out
http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Girl-to-Kiss-You-if-You-Are-a-Girl
Airplane and SpaceBalls put together into one movie
really in the US? I mean the anime and movies have phased out in the UK already asides from Jetix still showing D/P and the movies do get shown in chronological order on CN and Jetix
but DVD release, the last one we had after Jirachi movie was movie 10
and movie 13 comes out this september
SEPTEMBER
hehe
^^ that is the funniest thing you will ever read in your life
concidering you read a lot of funny things in your life.
hmm
13I'll be turning 18 in September
13...wow :|
06:3
/me suddenly feels old
13D:
Your already going through your mid life crisis?
/me runs so fast
http://dontevenreply.com/view.php?post=19
^lol
06You'll be as old as me for a whole month.
sounds like somthing I should do to a friend of mine
06Kinda, you know what I mean :3
the TV show is still on Cartoon Network but its ratings are dismal and the movies just get aired on Cartoon Network once and then go straight to DVD from what I hear
13and I'll finally be able to legally browse some of the sites I visit :D
13I mean
13what?
13:B
02O-o Angel..
06So it was a very 0/1 thing going on there
06also lol
in the US there has not been a theatrical release since Pokemon Heroes in 2003
and even then that was not widespread
12For some reason I can never find movie 7 on sale here in the UK =<
Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon The Movie 2000, and Pokemon 3 The Movie were widespread releases
http://dontevenreply.com/top.php
12It's okay, not the best Pokémon film but ehh it's watchable I guess
I've seen it there and its PAL, so maybe it has an english version I dunno
12Oh right owo thanks for the tip =)
13wb Sky :3
10Thanks, Espy
o.o
SKY!
/me huggles
Xd
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
10I asked earlier, not sure why you haven't responded. If you don't want to, please let me know
Or else
oh sorry
:D
this situation is not too upsetting to me
although it was frustrating trying to find DVD box sets for Johto
because Viz squats on their licenses
12If the anime was like the manga...it would be awesome ¦3
ew
um no
it might have failed and remained obscure
I will
kk
because what works in manga does not always work in anime
in this case it would not
13kids wb HML
the TV show was a huge hit for the first two seasons as it existed because it seemed to have something for everyone in that era
not to mention a main girl with a significant depth in personality
plus it was before Brock's skirt chasing got out of hand
Ouch
Harsh truth :<
03I'm serious

drf needs some APPLE juice
03now, my laptop actually has a "US International' layout, in that instead of right alt, it says ALT GR
03but that's really the only difference
mine is just US

12 Hello, Nyan and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Haha
nice name
Back from the outdoors?
yep
and getting more giant paper?
tons more
hinger yinger gurgen
We need a noob here to pick on.
Dari!
Find us a noob!
Imagine the kind of havoc we'd face if someone like Ammeg entered this room.
/me shudders.
Hahaha
*journals
Lol, about what?
I... *ahem*...
took a MLP personality quiz
/me cowers in embarassment
/me faints.
This is the kind of thing you do once you stop loving lamp.
I should have never stopped loving lamp
but now that I don't
it is hard to go back
It's never too late to rekindle your love for lamp.
I will try
so what'd she say?
Hm?
Oh, Ammeg
she was being a typical Ammeg and said basically nothing useful whatsoever
and I quote: "lollollol"
lollollol
I've noticed she hasn't been AS bad around the forum lately
she doesn't just reply to EVERY single thing someone says as much
13Goodnight all :3
04hey
Churchmera has been cleansed?
:D
She's been worse, if you ask me.
oh yeah?
hmm
I guess I haven't been on as frequently either :P
True. She claims her father died, and just talks about how terrible he was all the time.
I think she just makes everything up for attention.
oh wow, I didn't know anything about that
It's all a farce.
Knowing her, I can believe it
o
She also hates lamp.
Oh... the lamp hater is back.
:(
/me throws rocks.
/me makes a forcefield and deflects the rocks
Darn you, Sue Richards!
I feel so left out
just because I hate lamp
no one accepts me now
I hate lamp too
remember?
I'll sue you all
Oh
right
I converted
!shipping
Umbreon
and dari's uncertain
so it's just Nyan
Yep
This discrimination against haters of lamp must end
Not as long as I draw breath.
Let us go crusading for the hating of lamp!
Nah, screw that
but everyone else?
Pfft
:P
That is my campaign platform
You're despicable.
I can't believe you'll even consort with antilampists, never mind defend them.
/me yawns
Anti-lampists speak the word of Truth
I learned this in my travels
The only truth that can be seen is mirrored in the love for lamp.
You are merely deceived by a sad facsimile of truth.
o..o
10o-o
/me shares a salad with Feather

D:
just missed him
whoops
oh well
who needs him? :P
jk
:P
Thank you ,3
;o
had a memory leak
and trust me, it caused me more problems than for you ;x
because now I have to fix up all the servers and config crap
and Altair and I will probably need to recompile
Oh timing
yeah I saw
Hivemind
we have a total of 113 BNC users across 6 servers
in the timeframe of 3 months ;x
You're too popular ;D
What is island's new IP?
/me reconfigs ZNC
island.lugia.us
or 67.21.84.209
I removed port 1337
as something was using it
04my flash project
04is going to be
Nude?
04a freaking A++++
/me smile
Altair
you on?
04I think I'm overkilling my final XD
04It's an HD Pokémon battle scene from Black/White
04Snivy VS. Wild Audino.
Linkpz
04And if anyone who knows actionscript can help me
04it'll be interactable :P
04um
04not finished yet
04but I can upload my current progress of my .swf
04currently it's just animated Audino for testing purposes |D
damnit, bitch
04soooo...
04HML, know any Flash actionscript?
lmao
daaaaaamnit, one of my 5 BOPMs went poof ;;
so now we only have 4...plus services dnsbl...
/me sobs
HML- Do you know any programming?
Sadly, nope
:<
ALTAIR BITCH
/me screams
okay whatever
/me covers his ears
XD
actionscript.
mfw
but
xD
I wouldn't count AS as programming really
well technically it is
but it's such a b*tch that I wouldn't use it
heya XD
so what's up
how're you
other than screaming your head off
/me rubs his ears
XD
I'm hungry
/me goes out to buy food
lol
it's recess anyway
so yeah, be back in 5 minutes
lol
have fun with that
don't take candy from strangers
unless they're push pops
(get it)
04heh
04All I need for programming is just a few calculators for damage and calling to other frames when someone presses a button...
04Maybe this is more complex than I thought XD
/me gives Flash a Cacti
xD
oh
isn't the calling frame thing just a goto();
04well yeah
04you
04're right
04but like
derp
04I wanted calculators for damage as well
write an array
04and things like, if a certain value = 0 then goto death frames
like, x, y = shithere
oh
04that value being damage :P
it uses if (stuff == 0) {
or something
it's like C
or C++
can't remember
I dropped AS ages ago ;x
04heh
anyone here ever airbrush a laptop before?
04I have some knowledge of C
:/ mope. sounds fun though
or something
so if (yourvalue == 0) { goto(); };
04should probably look up some tutorials
04That might help
do that
04THere's probably dozens of actionscript game tutorials on Youtube |D
04cultivating a crapload of them should help, lul
Greetings everyone.
Heya Ecco
04hi Ecco
04um
04CS5?
04would that mean version 4?
ActionScript 2 or ActionScript 3?
04hm
04probably 3
There's only 2
ewwwwww
04:V
04well
Why the flying F*CK are you using 3
04I don't NEED to use it
use 2
04k
3 has a fckload of bugs
04I wasn't even using AS yet XD
has more bugs than my garden does
04wanna see the current animation progress tho?
I'm at school
04oh
04no flash...?
04heh
yeah im wondering if it would be worth doing it myself
no just blocked sites
or getting it done professionally.
04how about I give you the link, you E-Mail it to yourself, and then you look at it at home |D
04or I can E-Mail it to you
04I mean
imma lazy fck
04I think "E-Mailing for work related purposes" is allowed
04and lol
04u lazy ;P
just mail it to me
Hmm, well, you could always get one of them Skinz things. Make your own design, upload it to there, and then have em print it out and mail it to you
I'll check it after you do so
or are you just looking for a nice solid color?
whatever you prefer
also
telnetting into IRC is fun ;x
just looking for a solid color
well, should be easy enough to do it yourself then

ohai
whats up
Sky
you/
?*
Reading and Figaro
Ah
yush
who are you again
O.o
A person
a homo sapien
and good job Haseo
wwat
hmm, Rum and pepsi tonight?
yesh!
/me gots a head start
/me pukes in the corner
hmm, perhaps I will drink the RUm after I finish my pepsi
fuck you MtChar
owait that was praise
carry on
/me idle
02you there?
04http://www.mediafire.com/?z9wwotwcleggpnd current progress
xD
Perhaps I will drink the pepssi after I finish the rum
04...why is nobody here ;-;
/me rawrs
02I'm here... lurking... like a boss
yes Ray?
let me guess
your playing Morrowind
and you are currently at level 3 or 2
02yep
022
Your a poor bastard
but yes
cliff racers are bastards
Where are you now
02in the mage guild, in balmore.. afraid of cliff racers ewe
Gawd
betchj
Mage Guild?
you can do better
But yeah
02.-.
heading up to that Fort, you'll get attacked by Cliff Racrs
but there is no other way around it
I strongly
fuck
I order you
02They were too many >-<
02I can kill one or two at the same time
to at least gain some spells from the Temple or Mages Guild
02But 7
that act as..
what
027?!
okay you used that meme
and seriously?
Seven?
02Yeah ;_;
You either fucked up and ran back to balmora
Or
Yay
somehow they spawned alot there
seven or more are usually found around the area near Ghost-Fence
02I tried to run, and they still raped me
never in my gaming time of Morrowind did I find seven there
thats because if you run they can still hit you
unless your very far away from them
02;_;
So then
I suppose you went to the Imperial Fort?
02Yeah
No way you could find that many or any Cliff Racers when- okay
Go to Caldera
02why? o-o
Because on your way there you need to find a girl (trader) whom has the blinding boots of speed
get a good weapon
get her to hla ode
talk to her about being a bad trader
kill her
take the boots
and it'll have a benefit
02Ki-- ...
and a consequence
ZA WARUDO
02Inb4: rape
inb4 corpse babies
:o
you can guess the consequence by its name
the boots of Blinding Speed
02I've been raped by merchants before ;_;
02not fun.
..
okay
what weapon
do you have
and what race are you
02Dark elf (hence the mage guild ¬¬) and a iron broadsword
Fuck
no wonder you suck in close combat
BATTLE MAGE
your long sword skill has to be 20 at least
which sucks
what armor are you wearing
/me has it at 35 ._.
Why are you using swords
yeah, it still sucks
Equip a firestaff
Firestaffs are still weapons
in Morrowind, you bash them
02I wish I had one in the firstplace
you can use the magic quality of it
In Oblivion, shit comes out of your wants
wands
staves
rofl
but it can still be a melele weapons
Ray; what
is
your
armor
02also, why the hell does the magicka (or however it's spelled) doesn't recover when I rest?
Because its not an easy game
and what birth sign did you choose
yeah morrowind was hard as balls
go play oblivion dude
02I have been stuck in melee combat for a good while ¬¬
thats what made it good
Oblivion was amazing
Oblivion sucked hard
You suck hard
is graphics were good
Build one
04grah
Ray; like I asked thrice
what armor
04Now I know why I'm using 3.0
02Imperial armor
043D transforming X_X
..
why are you wearing heavy armor
rofl
you're not being a good mage
02:D
02Funfact: I know
Heavy armor is for those that actually train in it
like Orcs
lol
but I use Redoran Armor
I know :P
Ray; so then whats your armor rating
lol
and skill for Heavy
023
No wonder you die
your like a..
bro
what are they call?
Nub
No
02Kthx
Restart your game dude
those small creatures
Imp?
like worms
oh
uhm...
but paralize you
/me shrugs
anyways
02Oh, I know
I haven't played Morrowind in years
whats your heavy armor skill Ray?
02Low, very very LOW.
(though I'm guessing if its three than your only wearing a chestplate)
or curicass
as the world calls it
I recommend you train with spells for the moment
02hmm..
Dark elves are bad asses with spells
it took me DAYS for my Orc to even get into disciple of the Temple
but now he's Patriarch of it
Typically Dark Elves can exceed at anything if you train them well
02O-o
but with level 3, I'd recommend going to the major cities of Al'Ruhn
Why did you make yourself a mage when you're not doing any mage stuff
or Ald'Rhun
and Caledra
*Caldera
because you can get some good weapons and training at Al'Rhun
and Caldera you can meet Creeper
and make a shit ton of gold
02tell me a way to get gold
02aside from looting people/houses
Well there are numerous ways
doing jobs for instances
random jobs
like side-quests
hence doing that Boots of Blinding Speed
there are maybe 2-3 Cliff Races on the way to the Marshes
02is that merchant "easy to kill"
There are some other things like Guar
She has a silver dagger
02Hmm..
she was easy for me to kill
for I'm an Orc
and killed Umbra when I was on level 7
So for you..
practice killing rats with your sword
make it go up to forty
then go to Caldera
follow the road
02maybe 5 fireballs and she's dead (I think ._.)
you may ignore the naked Nord
go to east
then east
find her
and follow the signs to Hla Ode
02signs :D
and by easy
*east
I mean go by the road via east
there are two forks in the road
02yet another funfact: It took 3 hours of my life to get to balmore
which causes confusion for the naked nords quest
..
the fuck
why didn't you use a Silt Strider
02I got lost :D
Who has a gaming computer
in here
thats the fun part about Morrowind
you get lost
you find stuff you didn't even want to find
02Because I didn't knew of it's existence after a while
and get money
you do realize the first quest in the game
is to go to Balmora
02yeah
Anyways
02that's why I went there
Ray, fuck the main quest
don't do it for a long time
save up for it
02.____.
I didn't do the second quest of the main quest for..
some 80 days
for I was doing guild and Great Houses quests
its alot easier
02yeah
and if you wanna be a warrior join house Redoran
fuck Telvanni
and fuck Hlaaly
*Hlaalu
just opportunistics and isolationists
02.-.
hlaalu is an Imperial Cock-sucker
Basically
and Telvanni, although mage, is against the mages guild
and is very aggressive
pro-foundly fond of Slavery
your best bet morally
and for warrior status
is Redoran
02Hmm..
Tell me your magic qualities as well
/me checks
02here they go:
02Destruction = 48
02restauration = 35
02enchant = 20 (lol)
02alchemy = 20
02conjuration = 11
02and Illusion = 10
the first two are moderate
but work on them more
make them at least 50 or 60
work on ullusion and conjuration
02'k
ehcnating and alchemy are only important if you want to make your own weapons and or potions
if your spells aren't good enough
but its your call on alchemy
its good either way
I'm mainly a warrior with small magic qualities
like Almsivi Intervention
and some restoration spells
and some small restoration spells
like a Dewmer spell
on conjuration at least
02:\
02aside from selling your sould for potions
02soul*
02oh anyways, I need to sleep. I'll be back tomorrow
02Kthxbai~
Hey guys
hi
03Hexic HD is such a mindf***
Hey
I'm kinda freaking out about this weekend x-x
I mean I'm probably stupid for worrying about the whole May 21st thing but still
;-;
:/
whats going on? :|
Apparently
This guy is saying that the earth will end with a massive 5-month quake on May 21st
I really don't believe it hut
*but
03hi
there is no logic behind that :|
The thought kinda digs into my mind and bothers me x-x
Well
He said that in the book of revalations, it's implied the earth will end 7,000 years after the great flood
And dating 7,000 after the event would be today's May 21st
..how does he know the date of the great flood?
Hi
It was said to be the 17th of the second month apparently
Translating that off the Hebrew calander to todays calander apparently leads to this saturday
meh
I still don't really think the original date would be remembered this long
Well it was written down :P
But implications can be misinterprited
yeahh..
Let's HOPE it was misinterprited...
That world ending shit is a myth
>_>
Most likely is

02Geography, Physics, English and Histery homework
why? D:
13wtf it's biology, not math
I understand physics
but in bio? that's just silly
13but yeah
12Yeah, quite a lot
the reason why I like bio over physics
13I haven't done math since nearly a year ago
is the LACK of math XD
13and the question was about percentages
12Do you remember the question?
13and I completely forgot how to do them :<

02^
they teach it so terribly
02^ x 2
acting like it's common knowledge
02^ x 9001
12at least my philosophy questions were nice in the exam because previous exams have had dodgy questions n.n
13Hate dodgy questions
13why must they be worded so terribly :<
ones that are just left to the reader's interpretation
those are the worst

They're doing Fame this year

I can't stand HSM
/me remembers actually liking in as a Year 5/4th grader

10Now I'm a grouchy mod (Take that as you will) :3
I used to use ^________________________^ and -_-
Starlitface
I use ^______________________^ nowadays to state I'm mocking someone
and occasionally -_- just to emphasize stuff
3OHAI
3O
but I don't use it constantly
10You would overuse caps and "LOL" too
3I'm back
yeah I used to overuse LOL and caps
12Welcome back :3
Ohio
I usually don't use LOL nowadays
3So, what's the topic?
I wonder who lives there
only when something is actually funny
which is kinda rare
O_o
Everything is funny to me XD
10DD, we're talking about old days
3K.
don't think I've used LOL on this network
or at least seriously
or meaning it
I either use loooool to mean I find it funny
LOL is only if it's really really really funny
Altair is a derp
and it's kinda uncharacteristic of me to use that, if you know what I mean
Altair is cool lol
3I'm poofing. Darn rabbits are eating mah garden!
o.o
/me found a good example
10You getting off topic

Sorry, hostmask gave you away immediately
I wasn't actually intending to make anyone wonder who it was. xD
I remember it because the first five digits are the same as mine

I never noticed that
how are you?
i use it on mine whats up
Eh, less than chipper.
I just found out I don't get to visit any of my cousins that are in the army.
although i dont know how to fix it if u bricked ur router or something. mine was extremely easy to do =/
D:
why not?
i know a lot you have to do weird power cycles and crap
Log1x: I was "tweaking" the settings on my router for firewall, and the config page no longer workd
but I can ping the router
ad telnet into it.
Damn airfare. It's outrageous. Round trip it would cost me $600 bucks (plus air taxes) at the cheapest.
oh wow
where are they stationed?
did you try doing the hard reset thing
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Hard_reset_or_30/30/30
but I dont want to lose my crap D:
I know how to fix it that way...
;_; probably going to be inevitable if it wont let you login
One's in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and the other's in North Carolina at Fort Bragg. That particular ticket would have been to Missouri, though.
unless its frozen or something
Maybe just restart it
ah
but since ssh works :$
I have too many connections open now
yeah, they aren't exctly right next door, huh?

fucking up soldering LEDs is one thing
what is with you and trench coats?
though any little kid can do that
but wat
oh and did i mention the fact that
when he first got a GCN
they look awesome
he spent the better part of half an hour
trying to find which slot the GCN cont goes into
I have to agree. Trench coats make the world turn.
eventually he figured out that it does indeed go into the front slot

Now I'm listening to classical music
more like listening to AM stations here
I get some strange ones up here
there is one on 1200 that plays music from India
along with one on 1470 that runs 50,000 watts which by the way is an illegal power level on said frequency
both are from Canada though
there is another on 1320 that plays Chinese language music too
to make things even more amusing the AM stations on 1320 and 1470 are actually in stereo

/me is sad
i didn't even know nicks could drop

12They do if you don't use them for 60 or 120 days.. one of the two..
12What was your name anyway?
or whatever you want to call me
12Oh hi ^v^
12May I have my name back please? XD
12I was going to use it yesterday as well LOL
Hai Arti!
12Hi ^v^
How are you? :3
Maybe. I like using it though and I'm terrible at coming up with actual names.
12:'(
12and I'm rather sad.. not just because my name got unregistered but also because I have had a real hard time at work lately >v<
12how are you?
I'm okay enough. Bored etc.
Heya :o
Ouch :<
Life's boring in general.
I'm fine.

12I gues.. you're not coming....?
12What abouyt just one day..?
12You'd only need one return ticket :(
angel
12What about just the 16th? >v<
I am sad :'(
13Train tickets are pretty expensive, plus it's pretty hard for me to get from here to Newcastle anyway ^^;
12It takes two hours, is that too long then..? ><
12It'll take me and Xai about the same amount ^^;
tried the trainlne angel?
also maybe get a railcard?
13I've never needed to use the train before so |D
13and even if I did want to ask my parents to drive me there, they'd be too busy to do so anyway
12>v<
/me whines
04hihi
04Arti :D
;o
12*sigh* I just checked ticket prices..
13I don't know exactly, but when Lati came here by train from Manchester once she said it was about £40 for a day ticket
12yeh it's £52 return -v-
12I CANT BELIEVE it's gone up that much.......
13Sorry, I feel bad about getting your hopes up only to end up disappointing you ^^;
O___O
52 pound from yorkshire to nEwcastle?
British rail you're having larf!
13Though, didn't you mention something about coming to Scarborough sometime soon?
13At least I'll be able to see you then :D
03hm, now it's time to see if these powerline Ethernet adapters work
03I'm sick and tired of trying to use Wi-Fi in my basement to play my Xbox 360 and have it disconnect me every 20 seconds
13Anyway, I'll be back in about half an hour or so

12Why not post it yourself? XD
/me red-tailed hawk, hanging out with too much birds gets him into the birdy spirit sometimes
I want it for SS though Isurka

12Nice to see that side of you ahgain Isukra ^v^
12i just randomly from bird to umbreon
sorry not being nasty, I don't like hacked pokemon it spoils the whole GTS thing
12you'd be surprised how much people like me as an umbreon
12Nick
12people like to make hacked pokemon as realistic as possible
12but i make them look as hacked as possible on purpose so you don't mix them up

The weather factory in MLP reminds me of one of the levels in Spyro.
I haven't gotten that far yet
in MLP
I just watched episode 2 last night :P
Oh right. :P
http://www.halolz.com/2011/05/16/my-little-portal-2/
Haha, wow.
I was thinking the other day someone should edit the "I FUCKING LOVE COLOURING" picture to "I FUCKING LOVE PONIES", changing the colouring pencil to a pony. XD
XD
it'd be awkward having the kid holding a pony like that
Oh, there's a pony with a rainbow for a cutie mark.
Oh, two. O_o
is it rainbow dash?
Nope.
no, rainbow dash has a lighning bolt
*lightning
amirite?
A rainbow lightning bolt. :P
haha
I'm starting to think Trollestia only have one eye, when do you ever see both? XD
has*
hmm
now that you mention it you do only ever see one eye
cyclopestia
oh wait
Lawl.
Cyclotrollestia?
I'm thinking of the evil sister
who's trollestia?
or what
Trollestia is Celestia, she got renamed because she's such a troll.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sPwM3guang&feature=related
Wait, Doctor Whooves grew wings for one episode? O___o
I didn't notice that the first time I watched it.
also, is Dr. Whooves the official name?
12back
I don't think he has an official name.
it always sounds echo-y after hearing that song
DO 15 BARREL ROLLS!

I consider it a challenge to watch all 10 minutes of it
What was I supposed to see?
I be trollin' :P
/me removes headphones
I am temporarily home alone
nobody will know that I am listening to a pony say "yay"
Lol.
mmm Jolly Ranchers jelly beans
or wait, no
Lifesavers jelly beans
BEST DAY EVER!
Lawl.
when you watch something for 10 minutes straight
it starts to sound veeeerrrrrry strange
Spitfire sounds like a character from Spyro.
Not sure why.
it does
you should make a Spyrony
Lol, Spike pretty much = Spyro.
Young purple dragon.
true
I guess it would be hard to do much to make him look different
oh wait
I thought you were saying he's already kinda like a pony
This guy's desktop is awesome: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130561200481.png

Hi.
lol
I need a Midi of Mr Toast's theme xD
Who
me.
Sixth formers are people in the final two years of school BTW.
ah
see, I instantly thought sixth graders
meaning 11 year olds :P
Yeah, well this was 17-19 year olds. :P
even better!
would that make you a fifth former?
Well that's the old system for naming the years in school, people only use sixth form to name the optional years of school after the age of 16, none of the previous years.
ah
I'm year 11.
Sixth formers describes people in year 12 and 13.
so you're only required to go to school until you're 16?
Yeah.

its 300MHZ of pure intel killer lmao ;)

/me has a 2.8GHz processor
2 core
dual triple ...
ok lol
xD
scary thing is I am up to 6 quad cores in my room
I have a laptop that has a quad core with 12GB ram
I think I should host Epic Chat :p
xD
nice laptop
What internet speed do you have?
its just standard cable modem ..... get about 1.2m solid download
I'm fine on that, DT
have to speedtest :P
quite happy with my 3.4Ghz quadcore
:OO
Cat bulldozer june 11th !
:D~~~~~
I have a pretty slow connections..
I might actually have money to get such a thing by then
connection*
we'll have to see
I might just have to upgrade my core i5
what special features does bulldozer have
is it amd?
have you read a product brief ?
yea
I have no idea what bulldozer is
ewwwwwwwwwwwww AMD D:
its made up of "modules" each module is basically 2 core
cores *
meh
initial release is going to be 8 core 6 core and 4 core
noice
Why dont you just put out like 10% more money and get an intel.
basically the module shares certain hardware portions between the two cores
there probably isn't *that* much difference between them anyway
not really cat
Cat: I meant when you got it..
trust me I have played with enough hardware lol
it's like the difference between ati and nvidia
that is, not very much
its negligible
except maybe one brand tends to be slightly cheaper
and the other tends to be better ;)
I prefer Nvidia myself but thats just preference
I use nvidia
seems nice enough
Cat: Meh, just saying my honest opinion, I have always used intel, and I like it, its trustworthy..
mmm double chocolate cake ::)
I have always used both ..... but when intel was running with netburst architecture I was staying with AMD
if you've always used intel, how do you know amd is so crap?
netburst was just eww
what's netburst all about?
I've used both intel and amd
it was the old pentium 4 architecture
Cat: My mom has AMD on her laptop, and its pretty slow
read about it
our pc at home used to have a Pentium 4
then I "upgraded" it
by which I mean I threw away everything but the hard drive and replaced them
hehe.
lol
my internet speed is 10/1
I pay for 25/1

You... you what?
Nooooooo!
Ah
there you are
we thought you had been eaten
By a grue.
XDDDD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpYloHajJNs
even better now
Watch that until the end, and I assure you there will be no disappointment.
Haha, you mean the grue from Zork?
Yeah.
Are you familiar with hotdiggedydemon?
Nope.
me neither
He's an animator, affiliated with Newgrounds. Anyway, read the description. It explains it perfectly.
Slow buffering.
It's a ten minute video. :P
Why'd they kill his dog?
Did you finish it?
Well music is playing for the end.
That's not even important. Embrace how facetious the ending was.
I dunno, I'm just surprised that furries...Killed the dog - you'd have thought they'd do something else. :P
Yeah... maybe they did so before they killed it.
Or afterwards.
Of course. They always come by for seconds.
...awkward
she need not worry about anything
You can't protect her from a grue. :o
No amount of protection you can provide will matter.
They have razor-sharp claws, and slavering jaws.

12you're welcome
it was in Gold and Silver along with Diamond and Pearl but was not a huge nusance
12hmm
you did not get whole areas rendered useless if you don't defeat the elite four within X number of days
I did find swarms to be something of a pain but nowhere near as big
because they are recuring unlike the White Forest and Black City
if you miss them once you will get another one
hi
hi
because they most likely would not think the whole world is like Tokyo and penalize people for not being speed gamers or not knowing a couple dozen people in their area who play Pokemon games
sort of a rant that some of you might find unfavorable but it had to be said
I just hate the over emphasis on time, the extreme difficulty in obtaining pre generation 5 creatures, and some of the generation 5 creatures themselves
I saw it
and I don't want it
because EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
lol
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/BigCN401/Pokemon%20M5-M7%20BD25/m5_bd04.jpg < not the best shot, but you can see the pidgey are about 720p
yes
\and the colours still have that turqouise tint
is it two discs are just one
if its two I can just throw the Destiny Deoxys disc aside and forget about it
oh whaat
DL or flippie?
no
two SEPARATE discs
nono,
EWW
EWW
EWW
is the current release a DL or flippie?
EWW
EWW
I don't know
that is why I asked you
i dont' know either
if its both movies combined into one disc I would rather pirate it
oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
because I don't want to buy ANY Advanced Generation TV show or movie ANYTHING
if its two separate discs I could perhaps justify it
and sound is stereo btw, apparently
and just destroy the Destiny Deoxys disc or give it to someone else
good: if it's native, not upscaled.
bad: it was surround on the DVD
EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW
ITS A SINGLE DISC
EWW EWW
also, NB: M5HD apparently airing on KIDS. better than this BD, HOpefully (colour, less cuts, etc)
no
I want the English version
cuts and all
no BS restored version
I would say bullspit but EWW CURSING KICK
so was my restored version BS?
its because I don't want those
I am trying to avoid buying this bundle because EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
so I want the English dubbed version AS IT APPEARS ON THE DISC!
no filtering
no "cut restores"
nothing
just a raw rip from the disc
or MPEG AVC transport stream
preferably the second of the two
but either way NO CHANGES
I want to AVOID buying this
but want Pokemon Heroes in HD
untouched
and dubbed in English
but I guess this criteria might be too much to ask so I guess I have no choice but to bite the bullet and swallow my pride at the same time and buy the movie along with a Blu Ray drive
>>oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
ENGLISH DUBBED
UNTOUCHED
those are key words here
yes
that means no filtering and no cut restores
>uploading a BDMV
from the screen shot given there it looks fine
>drf bothering to touch it
>mfw
all I ask for is the Pokemon Heroes portion only
so it should be smaller
not the whole disc
most people want both
not me
because EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
you'll either have to download all of it, or ask someone which m2ts is M5
because the distributer is run by a bunch of idiots
movies 4 and 5 would have made far more sense
Mirimax has the rights to both
think about this:
1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, etc
if.
we'll see if STARZ_HD bloadcasts a proper M4 in HD,
because all "HD" M4 i've seen or heard so far is really, an SD upscale (FILMBOX, TX/K)
if Netflix had it available I could rent the bundle, rip Pokemon Heroes only, and send it back
provided I buy a Blu Ray drive first
ohohoho
i brought one a month+? ago because i wanz my HDz and i am limited by internets.
provided my local rental has it (and half+ the time they don't)
in my case its because I am giving the format second thoughts
and positive ones in this case
plus it would be a good idea to handle all if not most optical disc formats currently in use
well, BD is one of the onry legal ways that they are distributing movies on HD.
you can AVCHD-DVD, but baisically nooone commercial movie studios use those
if I bought the bundle myself I might either resell the disc or destroy it
microwave oven looks attractive for that purpose
then shredder after that
don't microwave discs. i've tried it. it makes your oven smell bad.
it creates a nice light show though
or run it over with a car or bicycle
gravel road
or if I rip it and then resell it in a short enough time period it will not depreciate much
maybe by around one or two dollars
still quite significant in value

to make the WTF factor greater I am playing this into my AM stereo transmitter/signal generator
its actually being sent over the air on 1500 KHz AM
12XD
so there is a double whammy in its self
12How much does a AM signal generator cost?
several hundred dollars to several thousands
mine was about $80
12Ah
because its a simple transmitter I built from a kit
its output is C-QUAM AM stereo and in my setup I can output on 1250, 1450, and 1500
12Well that’s awesome, I had no idea those where even affordable
the thing is this one was a very short run kit
only about 13 were made
the sound quality output of this is very high as well and the only radio I have which does it justice is a car stereo made by Delco electronics in 1990
12usually*
every once in a while
sometimes for making sure the AM receivers I have work properly but much of the time its to play my own selection of music on air

4his religion can and will blast the fuck out of me
Well, did he?
Looks like you took the first opportunity, not him
!digimon
4I actually wasn't gonna go nuts on him. I was just asking and then he started to convert me
4or tried to
So let me get this straight
4Plus the dude he follows is a moron. He predicted that rapture would happen in 94
4and the floods in 70
4Niether happened
!digimon
13!pokemon
You were just asking at first without the intention of bullying or trolling. Then when he explained his position about favoriting your story, you see it as "trying to convert you" and start whining at him?

4Not that part
4That part I understood
13Lol, cloudy
And so he was wrong about stuff. What does that have to do with you?
13There's blue sky outside >w>;
4Becuase the dude never shuts up and is causing a disturbance
And OK, but then why didn't you just say, "OK, I understand" and leave him alone after that after he explained?
12!pokemon
12...
12!digimon
I didn't really want to have an argument about this; I was just surprised that you'd go after people like this
4I was too, tbh
4But really, I've seen his religion go after a buddy of mine becuase he's gay
4And another forsaked his family to go preech

12Me?
7When I brought a friend in with no connection to TST.
3His frined told me he was here(so i came.-.)
hey, I was brought here with no connection to TST <.<
07insinuate is not to enforce, however.
12No I just meant people who have no connection using TST's server for their own channels randomly lol
3.
also, that's following, Harpuia
12Bringing them to actual TST chat is fine, as in this channel
3no
12and Harpuia has an accounbt
12*account

How much?
7CTR is the full name of the person?

Finished downloading all the MLP episodes.
7Hence her lack of TST activity.

/me 7wants a Soul Dew for collection purposes in her White game. :P
He's been gone for a while :P
you can get a soul dew in black/white?
4and what does she go and do?
4>_<
7Well, sorta.
04how do you get Soul Dew in Black/White?! o_O
7The item is in the game.
I have one on my soulsilver
04where
04is it
04:c
from the event where you can get both latios and latias :]
13The Game
13:3c
7But you can't access it unless you download it elsewhere.
04lul
04ah
04Quan
7Hmm?
4Im sorry AE, what was that?
04Now Nintendo has a reason for RSE remakes
7Lol, true.
04lack of Soul Dew
/me runs
13xD
4my computer blacked out over your last 2 messages
lool, RSE remakes
7Ah, but the original R/S normally did not have that item.
4brb
that's when you know the world's moved on.
04yes it did
7It was only a mystery gift that allowed it?
04you silly
04true but
I consider RSE too new for remakes .-.
04the Soul Dew still is void from Gen 5 :3
also, good night people.
04eh
04cya]
04but
Minnet: get off the network
7I'd wait for 2014.
Okay, bye!
04RSE kinda are old...
12I will LOL if this new 3DS Pokémon game is Pokémon Grey or something
7That'd make B/W already obsolete! D:
04yeh
7Well, I'm gonna go play piano.
I could make a site, as long as you aren't too bothered about custom images for the site design and javascript stuff
:O
13Have fun o3o
technically I probably could do javascript
:OO
You could?
Cat:
:)
not for free
maybe for like, a tenner
how much?
or 20
ill give you $3
lol
no
xD
that's like, 3 pence
or something
Will it be good?
it'll conform to standards!
also, it really depends on what exactly you want the site to do
13Manly guys don't say lol
13Manly guys say AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
/me is shot
13Don't ask
13;w;
I don't think I will. AHAHAHAHAHAHA
EVERYTHING
13LOL
IT SHALL FTP HOOKERS
no.
I want it to display plans for my server sales.
you're selling servers?
God, everything thinks of the wrong type of manly. My name was based off James Bond. lol
I have a webhosting site i never got going
globalmax.com
and a design
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/gmax/index.htm
lemme see
one day ill get it up.
13I think you've said before that your username wasn't formed the way people probably think it was xD
too many people think manly=muscular
The thing is an image, though
13Didn't know it originated from there though o3o
Could I (you) tweak it so you can put in text instead?
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/gmax/template.htm
12I love dr pepper
by that definition, I am the least manly person on the entire earth XD
you cant use it
im just showing you an example of what I have
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 8Fraxure.
13Sheeeeeeeeeeena~
its all ready to go just need to buy the server and start selling.
hi Angel
hi HML
It's the smooth talking, gentleman-type manly, not overexploded muscular dude who wrestles bears every morning. lol
13LOL
12Like a smoothie
I see
13But what if the manly I have in mind is a smooth talking, overexposed muscular gentleman who wrestles bears every morning?
You want to buy a server from me :D ??
xD
that's quite a contrast XD
heh
Then you better lay off the drugs, because you're living a dream. lmfao
I already have a managed vps lined up
12Okay lets see what I get this time
12!pokemon
D:
but i just dont have the time to dedicate to getting a webhosting compny started.
I sell VPSs
/me is drinking coffee but is failing to stay awake
12=<

13caffeine

/me shot

4paper*

!pokemon
It's ei.
Nick, you are a 9Swadloon.
13pshaawww
13I've eaten paper before :3c
4I got halfway through before he said he forgot his wallet
12Unown = my least favourite LOL
13Also, sugar paper is tasty
where are you reselling from? softlayer?
12My first ever shiny = Unown. =<
12MY LUCK IS GREAT
4Im talking college ruled
4xD
swadloon
candy cane paper
ftw <3
and yes, it exists
thats not the thing that evolves into the pink huge headed jellyfish with lipstick is it?
no
vstarvps
12It's that grass thing that looks like it uses itself as a blanket
/me RUNS
12NO
12YOU
13LOL
/me chases with shotgun >o
4xD
4il eat PIECES for free
india?
/me also has a gun an ak with 100 round drum on finding out that swadloon does evolve into giant headed pink jellyfish with lipstick
4for the lulz
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH! *rataatatatatatat
Drinking water from a dirty sock is also a good dare. I forget which of my friends did that.
13Oh god
13xD
sounds dodgy to me
12don't get any ideas
Far less pleasant than it sounds.
but the VPS work
At least, for the people watching. xD
I can give you a trial
it looks like its hosted from india
someone dared someone else in my physics class today to spread out their hand on a table and stab in between the spaces of their fingers for a full five minutes with a sharpened pencil
its alright im alredy with softlayer
without hitting the skin for like $10
obviously no one did it for real....but some tried though XD
13I have friends who can do that really well o-o
13I can't do it at all though |D
DUDE. I tried that after watching Aliens. XD
I tried it with an eraser...I am pretty good at it
Except that it was with the rubber side of a pencil. I'd like to keep my fingers, haha.
but with a sharpened pencil....? I'd be way more jittery XD
I want usa
13I've seen a friend try it with an actual knife >.>;
they actually proposed using a knife
yeah
x.x
What HDD space you looking for?
That is how you live life. lol
people just WANT to have their body parts mangled apparently
13Lovely stuff
suck the marrow out of life
13xD
to borrow words from thoreau :P
quite literally
That reminds me of the time I jumped in rose bushes with my friends. We didn't know they were because it was nighttime, but we did know after one of my friends yelled in pain. Then we laughed at him while we held back out own pain.
its alright
dont bother
lol
4Why were you jumping in bushes?
that would be supremely painful
I'd done it
4DOING SOMTHING BAD AND RUNNING FROM THE COPS?
accidentally though XD
No.
you need to find a niche if you want to sell servers and stuff
We were trying to scare drivers passing by.
you cant just say everyone is your target customer
Actually, yeah, it was bad.
xD
seedboxes
+vps's
13I used to have rose bushes in my garden
I have made 2 sales
good
13and everyone who visited seemed to fall into them at some point
keep doing that
13I have no idea why o-o
4xD
And its recurring, so thats good
4I rememebr waiting for the bus one day after a snow
bed time night all
you need to pretty much sign up 20-30 customers a day
4someone threw a snowball at a car
4(no it wasnt me )
night nick
4and the guy pulled over
4and chased us xD
13Goodnight Nick :3
start an affiliate program and give a lot per customer.
what's messed up is, the only way to get a shortcut to my school is to go through a bunch of thorny bushes and muddy sand
:OO
I barely make any profit myself
and I choose that route than get stuck in super congested and heavy traffic XD
12Goodnight!
I can't see how it's worth it
4xD
Heya guys :D
you wont make any money in the next 6 months to 1 year
Kosovo!!!!
but after that you will start to see a good return if you do what I say.
/me glomps Kosovo~
/me is glomped
/me is also glomped :o
you have to ask yourself, is this a serious business or a hobby?
Oy, the glomps never end.
yeah :)
:P
. -.
Look, I just want a damn dedi
your only selling to get yourself a dedicated server?
thats all I am doing this for
yes.
/me glomps the chat
I need $75/mo
I am too young for a job
you wont get any serious customers then, just friends.
you are never too young to work.
dont ever use that excuse.
I am
/me glomps everyone in the chat list including Cube
I applied in 2 places, both said I am too young
do a paper round or chores for people
eep!
I still don't fit in after nearly two years. xD
/me is glomped
you fit in just as much as I do, manly. :P
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 6Anorith.
I said work, not slaving
12!pokemon
12SURFS UP DOODS
quite the contrast .-.
You sure? I do hold back quite a chunk of my personality, mostly because I'd get banned if I showed it. A lot of people say I'm mean RL, but that's just me being me. xD
but you aren't mean D:
there's a difference?
13Kyogre
AERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13y u eat mah shoes
13:c
AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I said jobs, not a career
meh
12THEY TASTY
Did you even read the first sentence. XD
12MOAR
lol
yes
I did :P
HEEEEEEEEEEEY
HEYYYYY!
How about the second? lmfao
LIKE, I HAVENT SEEN YOU IN A WHILE
I still don't get what exactly you need a $75 a month dedicated server for?
IKR?!
yes, lol
I've read the seventh sentence too
12that is really awesome =o
a lot of my personality is different here too
Yo
for instance, I'm WAY more shy irl
I mean, if you want it for storage, you could get a massive-sized HDD for much cheaper
I'm a prankster RL. I don't pull any lol stunts on TST. On other sites, yes, but not TST. xD
and a lot less talkative and outspoken
13My online personality is the person that I am on the inside, that most people don't give me a chance to show irl |D
something of that price is totally not worth it for online gaming
o.o
I need a fast speed
fast speeds*
12I have no idea to describe mine
at least 100mbit
same with Latios
13I'm really quiet and shy on the outside irl, but once I feel more comfortable around someone I start to open up and show my true colours :P
why?
With the server, I get: 3TB HDD 16GB RAM 100mbit unmetered,
same here
Everyone seems to be like that here, haha.
it takes a lot to really get me to open up
because
cheap
We're awesome
:D
/me shot
7Back.
volumedrive.com
12=D
wb~
13Of course, most people don't have much interest in giving me the opportunity to open up, so .-.
not that I'm reclusive or whatever
/me high fives back
he's like 15 or something
I was close!
but most people IRL are idiots or jerks so ._.
sweet
Heya
I was programming for people when I was 14
thankfully tst isn't like that :>
Creepycool pic
Lol, Kosovo. XD
Late
theres always something you can do.
But bah
Kosoveon: there are still a handfull of people that arent. :D you just gotta find the right people
HML
13Lol Kosoveon, I can relate to that
HEY YOU
my brother is 11 and he just sold a website of his for $350
/me pokes a HML~
had a monthly profit of $100
x.x
Hey
no joke.
13Almost everyone in my year during my time at secondary school seemed to find reasons to make fun of me for some reason >>;
anyways I gtg, got work to do :P
same XD
yeah~ anyway! how has everyone been?
:OO
laters
13It's the main reason why I especially have trouble opening up to guys irl, but let's not go into that |D
12High school = LOLdramalamaplace
7Ah, high school.
Man, I got lucky. I made all my friends in preschool, and I had two older brothers already in my school, so I couldn't get made fun of without any backup.
a lot of the friends I've made over my lifetime have either moved or betrayed me in some way
Kosoveon: that sucks.
what do you need such a fast server for?
that's why I'm a lot more cautious
Many things
I still have alot of bffs that I still keep in contact with :3
12You know they're worth it if they stay in contact with you
first of all, security
I need a VPN
13Most of the friends I've made in the past have just used me as a stepping stone to get to the "better" groups >>;
12its a two way thing though
