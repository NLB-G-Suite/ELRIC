what's the next schedule?
More interviews tomorrow?
DocSane: :S Yeah, why?
CCCP: I seek out horrible things.
what is next?
DocSane: oh
Why do YOU all seem to know about that?
Wait ITS OVER? ;_;
DocSane: Electric Scootaloo is just a take on the term Electric Boogaloo. plus there's so much erotic fanfiction of everything out there that you're bound to land a similar title
im back
CCCP: someone must have recorded it, wait for it on YT
I know about Breakin' 2.
what did I miss?
Alchemist: The VA pannel.
well now that the most important part is over we can go back to the circlejerk

lol
It's such an old, old joke to use ___ 2: Electric Boogaloo.
Black Sheep 2: Do Androids Dream of Electric Boogaloo.

MadSurge: i know BUT THATS TOOOOOOOOO FUCKING LONG!
GilDash: is that it for today??

DocSane: no thanks O_O
Hello, CCCP
so dont take me up on the times
there is a character named Luna, who has blue hair, and lives on the moon
There's a reason I avoid most fan fic. It's because every so often you run across stuff like THAT.
Ryunosuke: :O :O :O
CCCP: I could try and find you a panel where Tara voices Darth Vader with Bubbles' voice :D
is anything playing on the bronystate livestream?>
its midnight now, but my Brony Spirit kept me from sleeping
though luna has came back
its two in the morning for me
MadSurge: Did that happen?
valoreins: midnight? pffft i go to bed at 4 am

Twilight_Sprinkle: it should be on now then, correct?
oh bai cyber_pony13
...
Please dont groan at me, but I found many interviews somehow awkward.... Other interviews (like the latest with Tara on the Fat Man on Batman show) seems to be more "natural", more..."fluid", continuous.
So hot outside. I wish I could be wearing a floaty dress instead of binding pants or shorts.
Dont know why.
oni_link: yeah, and there it is
can someone give mah the link to wat yall is watchin?

Hello OneTrickPony
GOOD MORNING Computer_Pony :)
hai AttackWithHugs
hiya Computer_Pony
What Im curious about and would like to ask one of the VAs is that did they interact with the really young fanbase (<14 yrs old) or did they get any feedback from them.
HI OneTrickPony :P /)
hey OneTrickPony hows your day been
/me reads up on The Spoony One controversy
alexxm: great, how bout yours?
Alchemist: the Va's actually like to eat the younger fans
/me hugs OneTrickPony
like toast
i'm good OneTrickPony
/me hugs AttackWithHugs back
Tovler which controversity? I like Noah, what happened?
CCCP: its a kind of sacrifice?
So, are they done with cosplay and tweetponies?
Alchemist: yes
:P /
is anyone watching the Bronycon stream?
MadSurge, those are this hour

OneTrickPony me is watching
Lil_B: yeeeeah. I'll have to PM you the details. It's NSFW
Tovler ok

Next hour is Game developers
Kandarihu I hope they can show everything XD, there are at least 4 or 5 MLP Fangames in the making Oo

Well, later dudes :)
bye MegaMoonShine
Night, MegaMoonShine
hi CountDoofus
bye MegaMoonShine
Hai CCCP
bye MegaMoonShine
hey CountDoofus
Alchemist: I slept 16 hours since yesterday and I missed movie night last night. I want to stay for euro movie night. As it's actually movies I want to see this time.
Hai alexxm
Now Rainbow my dear i cannot express my delight!
Been here for a while, but oh well :)
Its abundantly clear that some where out here is a pet that will suit you just right!
I can't wait to get started but first let me set a few rules
Alchemist: Unknown... I've had them last a whole week before.
Alchemist: Completely random
I wish I could have seen the the cosplay interview with the couple dressed as the Cakes complete with baby cake twin plushies.
FairysHuff: and I guess CT scan and EEG were inconclusive and you are on a cocktail?
so does anyone know what was up with the mail server this week
Alchemist: Never had a CT scan or EEG. Doctors just did blood tests but didn't find any indicators. So I'm on Amatryptoline which I'm taking a break from for a month hence the huge level of pain.
I still haven't got my newsletter
nope. we didnt get any newsletters. thats all I know.
Kandarihu: I do that to. But I want to see the movies today.
alexxm: just that BS wasn't able to send mails, and now tries to change their mail sending system and that this lottery the survey from last week will be reused
ok thanks diddutz
waiting -_-
FairysHuff: weird, they didnt do any bloodtest with me. Oh, doctors and their ways :D
/me shouts with Heavy's voice "DOCTOOR!!"
CCCCCCCCCCCCP: Nice nick :D
Alchemist: Yeh. This IS the NHS we're talking about. They probably don't want to do something as expensive as a CT without suspicion of something serious.
MadSurge: :3
Hello everypony!
/me waves
ohai kempa
T'would appear to be the most common video. Buffering.
Allo everypony
hi everypony
Well, if I have stuff I have to do over a headache, I tend to put pressure over the eye that's giving me pain (not actually touching the eye itself). You can try doing that during the movie. It's not like it's 3D anyway.
Meanwhile: hallo
hey Meanwhile
hey Meanwhile and Br0nyxia and valoreins
Allo BrOnyxia.
Well, that was a lot of flying around. Hiya, everypony.
hi Meanwhile! U missed Bronycon stream on Everree Radio! and trixie!
CCCCCCCCCCCCP: Implying I care about any of those.
/me shouts with Heavy's voice "DOCTOOR!!"

3D is horrible.
Hey everypony :3
hi MusicalPony
I have 3 minutes to decide whether or not to go buy chips for dinner or not.
FairysHuff: I wasnt mocking them, and I have no clue why they do/dont do things, its just funny they have different approaches to the same problem. (besides I'd trust any western hospital before mine)
Allo MusicalPony, BroKnee.
ohai SB
11,02Hai BroKnee :3

Hey, a Wild SuperBrony64 appears :)

SuperBrony64: totes am :D
SuperBrony64: i would be.... if i was gonna be here ;_;
I'm never excited for anything but if I was then I would be.
I'm also excited for Laserpon3
11,02CCCP: ;~;
ummm... i dunno..

SuperBrony64, I would be if I had to vote for the lottery
MusicalPony: I am

awesome AttackWithHugs are you watching it on everfree?
WHAT TO WATCH
must fill up water bottle... must not dehydrate in front of PC!
dammit for a second i thought bronycon went up again
MusicalPony: Of course. The recording method is better than January's.
Alchemist: Yes. But being my overly cautious self I wasn't comfortable meeting someone I'd never met before in an area I don't know. So I'm waiting till he has free time to meet me in Edinburgh.
bai errypony
AttackWithHugs: yeah definitely. :P
Bye CCCP.
oh bai CCCP

AttackWithHugs: i know! I LOVE TOMBSTONE <33
someone should make a private chat for people that discuss the bronycon right now so we wont disturb people that are watching the BMN
That sounds like a goddamn plan.
lol when the bronycon is back on im not saying a single word here.
MusicalPony: I like some of his stuff, but I don't have "favorites" musician-wise. Songs, definitely
I'VE GOT A GODDAMN PLAN! i LOVE THAT meme

OK......time to see that Final Fantasy movie from a different perspective.......like if we were critics, just like the Nostalgia Critic
Silverscreen: Überbiscuits. Where you going?

Ah thats better
1,11That's my Penguin poster I've made for my Photoshop class here in College. :D
MusicalPony: I've been to many a convention (although not in a while, last few years) butthere is one constant on all I have ever seen. The Cosplay NEVER starts on time.
Hai Everypony
1,11And that's literally me posing as Penguin.
Back. I probably left it too late to put pizza on to cook. May miss a minute or two or the movie while I'm prepping it when its done.
Now where was I again? Oh, Tea http://derpy.me/GwNUN
Kencolt: oh man
tea and waffles
Silverscreen oh, I was about to say... you look alright
FairysHuff: Didnt miss anything
That is one scary monster.
MusicalPony: technical derpities, but Pony game developers will we on stream 2 in 15 min
Obsidian: Not yet. But I may. The pizza is cooking now. Ready in 15 minutes
i watched a documentary on bronies and the mlp community and i literally cried.. it was amazing.
1,11Tovler, just so you know, once BMN starts, you need to stop with spamming the Yu-Ghi-Oh cards.
just out of curiosity, how will the lottery be held?
hello everyone im back :)
WHERE ISH MY COSPLAY!? :{
hello sergio!
wb sergio
Hey there, sergio_scriptor.
Pizza… I don't have a card for that
*suggested
I return. With tea.
Silverscreen: Quick! Whats the plan?!
Because tea is good.

#OfficialEuroMovieNightHangout
i love this pony music...
its actually really good.
I'm getting white circle of no streamy :(
Dken2021: but from what pool? We didnt get to add nominations this week? did they pick something from the previous weeks' nominations?
SuperGotenks1989: THIS room right here /is/ the official movie night hang out.
I can only stay for the A Movie and maybe the first episode. :(
k
i heard a ping, did my chat derped?
oh lol
i might be able to see the episode... :3
SuperGotenks1989: Oh and also, no advertising other rooms in here.
My internet derped :o
Alchemist did you sign up for newsletter?
1,11http://i.imgur.com/P6JqL.jpg < The only thing that's real there is me and my clothing. (my webbed hands were photoshopped as well). The umbrella, the hat, the monicle, the cigarette holder, the background, the renamed logo and the embers were photoshopped in. :)
Alchemist oh sorry, nvm
while we wait: Yarrrrrrrrrrrr. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NW29q6C4Do
nopony got a newsletter this week Dken2021
so is the movie "final fantasy" has anything to do with final fantasy ? :|
1,11oh, and my nose is photoshopped as well. And my hair and beard are removed...
Silverscreen: Quite o_@
yea, that's what I fugured
So basically it's you but not really. :3
1,11Irish_Pony, if you want to be a gentleman, you must do it properly. o_q
1,11Sergio: ...yes.
sergio_scriptor: THere is a guy named SId
i wish to meet Lauren Faust...
oooooh *sudden realization* I guess there's no lottery then
Silverscreen: nope.avi o_@~
sergio_scriptor: Technially, yes. It has many of the themes in most Final Fantasy games. But it's a bit rushed. Visually beautiful though-- startlingly realistic. Almost broke Square at one point.
that is my life goal. if she dies before i meet her, my life will always be incomplete.
03heh, my grandma offered to buy me a GPS so I don't get lost in Florida
damn. The only way my A movie will be well received is if Silverscreen does his movie trivia on it (The Secret of Kells)
03But I already have one, just outdated
Can anypony confirm that Ashleigh Ball was in ME3 or not?
03time to see if I can pirate the maps
Kencolt: so it's a mediocre game-film ?
ME3? i dont think so Tovler
Rainbow Dash would be a good soldier.
Oh and Meet the Pyro.
i love Ashleigh...
1,11p_q
sergio_scriptor: Actually it's just a mediocre film. It has nothing to do with the actual games.
freakin harley quin right there!
Sucks cause they all die :(
I don't care what anyone says. I love Spirits Within.
Good for you.
the only thing I remember is when it came out it was considered to be the top tier animation.
Meanwhile: :| great,another "let's atract fans of the game wby naming our film the same as the game,but having nothing to do with the games",just like "doom" or "the super mario bros" movies :|
I got to leavef for 4 or five minutes passing chat to DoublePint
sergio_scriptor: No... it's got themes from ALL the games-- the recurring themes. The story itself is totally different-- just as each FF is different from each other. It was also the first truly photo-realistic all CGI film made-- visually stunning, and Square almost took a total dive on it because it wasn't commercially successful and it cost a LOT to make.
ohmy... this music isnt all good... meh. i wish i could change it
Assuming direct control
sergio_scriptor: Exactly.
Kencolt: well,as long has it's not as bad as "Doom" the movie then im ok with it

1,11Metronome, stop it.

hahahhaha omg i just remembered something. The whole voice panel was from canada and the guy was like "why do you think the best voice actors are from canada?" and i dont remember who but one of the ladies said "Because in canada it's 20% cooler" i was soooooo happy :D
sergio_scriptor: And at the time-- as today-- RPGs were and are a niche market. As a "gaming film" , well, it's not. It's a film with themes common to a series of games. And no, it's not as bad as doom.
We finally get to see one of my movies ^^
Mentronome: I can do it too... ☺ ☻
1,11I didn't like Spririts Within. It was boring, predictable, its characters were flat and all around stupid, it lacked any real morals, and after watching a ton of Final Fantasy gameplay in the student lounge, I don't see ANY similarities between that film and the series.
Mentrome: Without coping and pasting
I need to revisit the movie. I only saw Spirit Within once while it was in theatres and I was bored to death during it.
:D
Dken2021: There are also chocobos if you know whereto look-- on a poster, a t-chirt, a stuffed toy, a decal on a briefcase.
Silverscreen: Apparently there's a character in the games with the same name as one guy in the film. That's about it.
Kencolt: thank god,but it always anoys me that game-films never folow the exact story of a single player game,like WHY ? the story works perfectly with a movie format,why do movie companies need to chnage that ?! :|
living tombstone!!!!!!
Final Fantasy: Spirits Within was a massive tech demo.
Silverscreen: If you think about recuring themes in the games, you'll start to notice them.
wait. If I get carbs and mt dew, I can stay awake a little while longer
OK Everypony i must tell you something
Dark92Enigma: what is it ?
cake
!pokemon
Ran, you are a 6Wailmer.
!eonget
Mountain Dew. That stuff should be loaded into artillery shells.
yes Dark92Enigma ?
4Ran just got a female 7Flareon
Tovler: drink tea instead, it wont make you fat.
Meanwhile: That would be a war crime.
Someone riddle me this: What is the all-encompassing theme that defines a game as a Final Fantasy game?
The ace of ♠
I'm planning on making a fanfic starring the Nostalgia Critic
I love me some Arizona Green Tea
And the AVGN
Ninjazz: Eh, true. I'm pretty sure the Geneva Convention says something about utilising soft drinks.
straight caffeine just isn't enough.
sergio_scriptor kinda have to blame potential audience, reasons game films are different to game plots cause directors try to appeal to a large range of audiences
03LOL what
the name and similar world setup
032013 maps
Dark92Enigma: thats awesome!
03someone's a bit ahead of themselves
sergio_scriptor: Remember-- FF isn't a single story. It's a series of quite different stories with recurring themes. This is a moviw with a lot of FF themes in it. Really, it's rather unlike any film made before or since.
03the maps I have now are called 2012 and I got them last year
1,11That's like saying the Super Mario Brothers movie had a lot to do with the Game because it had the same general concepts and names. :/
Tovler: caffeine pills then? :D
Meanwhile: Soft drinks? That stuff burns like acid, man!
Silverscreen: Technically-- it did. Just in a horrible horrible way.
Frankly I think the FF games are piss as well, but go figure.
one final fantasy game has about as much to do wih the next as with this movie
MusicalPony IKR? It's already been done before, but he did'nt went to Equestria as A PONY
only ff game I played was ff4 and it was addictive.
Meanwhile: To each their own.
IV I enjoyed fro story, but V I enjoyed for gameplay
all FF games are "meh" but i only see it for a drawing/animation reference
Dken2021: but that never works! look at doom,the story of a marine that goes to hell to save everyone is awesome,why did they had to change it about a virus ?! it's anoying,the only good part about doom was the "first-person" scene,that was prety awesome
FairysHuff: Bring forth the sheeple.
This probably has more in common with games like FRF7, 8, and 10.
i has all teh vinyl scratch's on meh screen!!
a one trick pony's only got one song a one trick pony plays it all night long one trick pony never try something new one trick pony could be me or it could be you!
1,11Kencolt: As much as I enjoyed the SMB movie, I don't relate it to the game. It's too different. Same with Spirits within. It's more Sci-Fi than Fantasy, which completely destroys the concept from the very beginning.
Does anypony play ME3 multi on PC, DerpStar and I need decent teamates when either of us gets the PC
/me gasps
MY GOODNESS.
1,11I actually LIKED the DOOM movie.
lol
IT'S BEEN SO LONG!
/me slaps Silverscreen face
Silverscreen: As I said-- more in common with FF7, 8, or 10.
8,6my parents didn't realize the DOOM movie was based on a game until the FPS scene
The only thing I actually didn't like about Spirits within were the Characters (especially the stupidity of the Bad-Guy, firering the cannon even after he saw that he was wrong) and really broing middle... I just wasn't enjoing the movie, it had a lot of flaws
I enjoyed it as well Silverscreen but DerpStar hated it
sergio_scriptor true, though that really depends how much the source material has for a movie plot and the writer's ability to convert that
hey
8,6Side rooms are open for anyone that missed that
MusicalPony and i've planned on involving the AVGN on it too, but.......i don't know as much of him as i know NC (except that i've seen a thousand of his most famous reviews)
your ponies need moar ponies
1,11It had an original plot and story, but like SMB, I completely remove its correlation from the game.
im depressed.
why MusicalPony ?
/me hands MusicalPony a beer
Hello. : )
well shit
how come MusicalPony
Silverscreen, did you know that in the first draft of the SMB movie, it was orginally going to have more game elements in it and actually take place in the Mushrrom Kingdom? However, it went through many different revisions until it became the one we got
why MusicalPony? D:
d3rb: cause the cosplay isnt on D:
1,11It's how I enjoy Comic Book Movies and "based off a book" movies as well. I remove the correlation and I usually end up enjoying it more.
Final Fantasy or Pony game developper
NO COSPLAY D:
hey TVNOOD hows your day been
ohh
Hmm... I don't remember the opening to Spirits Withing starting like this.
o.O
Oh no
YES
passing DerpStar the PC cya everypony I shall be watching in the background
YES
DoublePint: i dont drink beer sorry
Silverscreen: so something like Stuart Little?
Nyeeeeeeeeeeeeh
the hell is this
Silverscreen: i went to see doom,hopping to see a marine go to hell and save everyone,instead i got something about a virus,that killed the movie for me,the only good part about doom was the frist person scene and the BFG3000
Pinke rulz! :D
Dat Pinkie Pie <3
party time :)
Pinkie :D
Back Everypony
LOL
How did I not see this coming
:O
well...there will probably be vids on yutube later, not the same but its something MusicalPony
no not this i don't approve of this song
Silverscreen Yes, but come to think of it, The movie has it's creativity.....because HOW COULD YOU STOMP ON TURTLES ON REAL LIFE?
So, we're doing Brony Movie Night anyway?
had this on in the background.
Party time :O
maybe i should turn off teh desktop ponies >.>
you bet it is Pinkie!
:O
Rapping Pinkie Pie!
Hey Kandarihu, whatsup!
:D Pinke gangsta
dat titanic movie
yeah Kandarihu why wouldn't we
omegasparkle, why would you turn desktop ponies off?
1,11Sergio_Scripter: You didn't like it because you had a biased pre-set opinion and expectation. That's why a TON of movies are disliked and it's why I end up liking what most people hate.
Kandarihu: Why would we not.
This sounds really weird with nightwish in the background :D
Pinkie is the only thing that makes this bearable
:O
to see teh stream
yayz
OH YEAH
they are all grouping on top of teh video
/me PARTY TIME
1,11JESmith71: Yes I did. In fact the script was changed daily to the point where Bob Hoskins and the guy who played Luigi openly ignored them and just did whatever they were told to do.
Its Party Time alright :D
Well, the Bronycon panel on the fangames is starting too
Silverscreen: tell me about it :=|
well all the flutershy's are, and they just stay quiet

Dark92Enigma I like the fact that this actually makes a lot of sense
Later MusicalPony
sorry, everypony
Bai MusicalPony
vinyl scratch is wandering around
Oh well. That's going onto Youtube tomorrow. This isn't. So it's EMN for me
Final Fantasy movie?
DrHobo: yep
bye MusicalPony
seeya MusicalPony , nice having ya here
bye MusicalPony
Yeah I know Silverscreen in fact Dennis Hopper got into a huge rant with the director because they rewrote the scene at the last minute and it was different from the one he rehearsed for
1,11The only movie I ever let myself build expectations for was The Avengers, and that's because I had 5 movies and a sh*tload of promotional material behind it.
Er, wait. It's going on Youtube next week. I don't know when tomorrow.
Lil_B So, you heard about my idea?
cya MusicalPony
Aka, A movie. With the words "Final" and "Fantasy" in the title for no other reason than milking it.
sergio_scriptor: wierd e3e
Silverscreen AND IT KICKED ASS!
I got my pizza, got my Spirits Within and I'm doped upto the eyeballs with painkillers. I'm good to go ^_^
Yay
This absolutely has nothing to do with FF.
Dark92Enigma maybe, but right know I don't know what you mean
:O Really Ninjazz ?
gaia
What the? I watched this yesterday...
1,11FairysHuff: I"m getting Pizza tonight. :D
FairysHuff: sounds like a kickass night :D
Probably. What's this movie again?
-is bored already-
...alright movie entertain me
k, back with some crazy bread
just waiting for all those dat ass moments
Final fantasy the spirits whithin
if i were the one who made the title of the movie, i would remove the "final fantasy" on that movie
1,11Dark92Enigma: F*** YEAH AVENGERS! But, I have to end that conversation here. The sh*t movie is starting.
Dramatic much.
Will we have more debates on if the A and B movies should have been swapped? Let's see...
Need ME movies
Lil_B about a fanfic starring the Nostalgia Critic
Silverscreen: Mine is just a oven baked frozen pizza. Saldy. ^_^
What is Euro movie night, Is it the same as friday movie night of what you missed?
o.o

omegasparkle: like in every second of mass effect?
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
Explosion
what movie is this?
oh now i remember this....
Suare made the movie, and considered it thematically FF. Your milage may vary.
final fantasy spirits within OneTrickPony
1,11Yeah, I think I would like this movie a lot better if it was just called Spirits Within.
LSD
this isn't final fantasy!
Silverscreen: Is Euro movie night The Friday movie night you missed?
see
sergio_scriptor gimme gimme lsd! :D
Cocaine its a hell of a drug
was the dream anything to do with the plot
I see
Lovely Sweet Dream
Thedude946z[Movie] yea, it's for the eurpoeans becasue friday night would start near midnight in their timezone
Silverscreen EEYUP, let's dive right into: Final Fantasy Spirits Within
Game saved

Save the earth? How original!
Evening all.
Interesting film,
this looks more like Star Wars than anything e3e
Meanwhile: :D good one
Meanwhile sounds like a final fantasy protagonist to me
hi pony_zen DerpStar sergio_scriptor and Dken2021 ;)
snap Meanwhile
hey Lil_B what have you been up to
The whole reason this game series even IS called Final Fantasy is because Square just made flop after flop out of every game they made. So they just decided to make one final game, a real fantasy game. And after that, they'd go out of business. The rest we know.
Final Fantasy? :P
Dken2021: Fair point.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The day and month shown after Aki's first dream (13 December) is director Hironobu Sakaguchi's wife's birthday.
"forced to live in various cities?"
What's so bad about that?
hey LordDerpington hows your day been
And if Saving the World isn't a FF theme, I don't know what is.
Silverscreen: It's also my birthday. :3
Fine thanks, alexxm - how's yours.
It would stink if you're an Applejack, I guess.
alexxm nothing much :/ actually I was in the chat all the time :/
1,11And to whoever asked, yes, the dreams do end up having something to do with the plot.

i'm good LordDerpington

sorry Lil_B i saw people saying hi and thought you left
dem boobz
oh come on
Kandarihu So basically....Square was running out of ideas, and named this fucker after Final Fantasy
Hello Science
That thing is google image project
cool Silverscreen
grafical wise this Movie was way ahead of its time, but they hadn't figured out how to proberly animate Skin in 3D (today they use multible layers and such
Lil_B, isn't it nice when somepony greet's you, you get a ton of other greetings from others who thought you just joined? troll level's are at maximium
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Seiko wrist watch worn by Aki Ross (known as the "wrist halo"), which produces the map of NYC, is a digital recreation of an actual Seiko watch made specifically to tie in with the movie. A different design with numerous cosmetic changes was sold publicly.
PONY XD
damn I derped my stream brbr
PONY about GalaCON
Dark92Enigma: No. Square was trying to make a movie using Final Fantasy themes-- story themes-- and did. Whethyer if a good movie is a matter of opinion.
Fireworks yaaaay
Kinda omnitoolish no?
She has a Pipboy 3000 :)
Dark92Enigma, they called it Final Fantasy because it was their final game, and it was a fantasy game. But it was a very original game.

Kandarihu: And then like 20 more.
alexxm np, happens sometimes to everyone

Darf14: i think it's more of pip-boy 5000 beacuse it looks way more advanced :)
sparkle sparkle
good point
Lil_B, most likely not gonna happen, I will see later... I'm supposed to go to another meeting at september which will sort of eat my budget.
Kandarihu That makes sense
PONY Does your offer with the tickets still stand?
PONY ok
FUCK YEAH! SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
Lil_B, if I go, then yes, the offer stands
Good evening everypony.
OOOHHH NOOOOO
Whooooooo
1,11It should be noted that we actually are close to developing the technology to make that watch, considering that when Iron Man premiered, the producers were told to make Stark's holograms more advanced to keep it more "futuristic".

Crap. I'm afraid I have already watched this movie. Anypony knows when it finishes so I can come back by then?
dem tentacle beasties
PONY because I decided they i certanly would, but I would pay for my ticket all by miself if it would eat your budget
Not tentacle rape I hope

1hour 20min i believe
Hi there Malavolent ;)
RUUUN
I've seen enough hentai to...

HOly crap ODST!!
alexxm: Nothing much really, it's too hot to do anything.
Pick up that can.,

suddenly cops
Here's a piece of trivia for you, Silverscreen -- Aki Rosswas the first "Virtual Actress" to have a pin-up in Maxim. (She wore a purple bikini.)
Shes letting the military doing the dirty work
The_Blazer: 1 hour 20min
PICK UP THAT F**KING CAN RIGHT NOW!
New perk: explosives noob
Hmm, if FF X-2, FFT, FFTA, FFTA2, FFXIII Arena, and Dissidia count.
Thank god for armour no?
Don't you know that every barrel is explosive? silly soldier.
shoot her
they got brotherhood of steel power armor
You've broken the LAAAAAAAAAAAAAU
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW?!
that soldier sounded like a black guy. will he die first?
1,11Kencolt: RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Aki Ross was named #87 on Maxim Magazine's "Hot 100" list for 2001, and was featured on the cover of the supplemental insert. She is the only nonexistent person to date to make that list.

Darf14 Looks like a Fluttershy
they are using the T-15 brotherhood power armor,requires training to use
No shit sherlock.
fuck yea, more sparkle!
just so you know; I AGREE with the let's get the hell outta here thing
Silverscreen: Another person on the Hot 100 list is the first male to be on the list, Stephen Colbert
What is this movie?
Oh, FF.
Right.
I love this movie
"FF"
Game over man Game over
Teehee
Risk there life for a fluttertree ..... good point
I like eruomoive night-
I often Fantasies of similar mather
It means I din't miss the part I missed in the USA veriso
I hate invisibility cloacks :|
1,11I'd like to also note that even the action feels boring in this film.
I like Euromovie night too, though it's not night
Indeed.
Funny. Everyone always says the black guy always dies first. But I can't think of one example of a movie in which that happens. Any examples of where this does?
Yay!
it's been 70 days, 0 hours and 40 minutes since there were new Ponies D:
Silverscreen reason number 2 I dislike this movie XD
Kandarihu: dead space 2 ? :|
SURPRISE! They made it out alive
are you gonna show pony episodes between movies like teh friday?
AHHH
Jurasic park Kandarihu
spoiler!
<This does not look like final fanstasy. As pretty as it is
THey saved Fluttershy
Euromovie night in afternoon, you can't explain that!
1,11Kandarihu: I think the cliche is more that the black man never survives.
Kandarihu It, Jaws 3D for example
This movie again I see
It's 8 pm here
Obsidian, NICE
"Good thing im indestructible"
What the
Silverscreen, fair enough
I'm a DOCTOR! Your argument is invalid!
Trivia: this bombed so badly it forced Squaresoft to fuse with its longtime rival Enix just to not fail finantially!
Kandarihu: Aliens is probably the most famous example.
man, what a b****
PEOPLE!
Reason Nr3. Stiff Dialoge, could need better Writing and Voiceacting :/
I didn't like Titan A.E. much. I don't stand a spirit of a chance at liking this movie.
wait, what movie is this again?
MadSurge: im so sorry for them :(
At least the conversation is very causal
FF
I like that
Sheppard ?
Silverscreen: So Advent Children is better than this?
Wrex
Wrex?
SilverScreen: except for the Thing. There out of about 12 people 2 are black and one of them survives :D
1,11The one positive thing in this film: I like to think that those suits are how the Brotherhood Armor work in Fallout.
That guy has got THE squarest head I have ever seen
is his face supposed to be a twist or something
Silverscreen this looks NOTHING like final fanstasy
MadSurge: what movie is this?
Love Interest Much?
sergio_scriptor: for Enix, right
Silverscreen that was the first thing I thought about. fallout suits.
'
What the......
So much... SCIENCE
misha it's more a sci-fi film
damnit, ad incoming!
So this is a vertibird?
Ah
1,11Starflash: /)

(\
This film seems good....
Fallout Fantsy?
Well, I'd like to look this up on TV Tropes. But my mom's watching, so I'm gonna have to look it up later.
Derp
I was also thinking of fallout when watching this movie
sooooo...where is the fantasy ?
1,11D3rb: That and dat ass.
I would bash more now, But Spoilers prevent me :/
MadSurge: !!!!!!!!!!!
BUT WHY CALL IT FINAL FANTASY?
MusicalPony: Final Fantasy the Spirits Within
Fallout fantasy would be pretty awesome actually.
oh.
And yes, Advent children is better imo :T
cant argue with dat ass
it takes place in THE REAL WORLD >:C

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The total production time on the film was over four years. By the time the final shots were rendered, some of the earlier ones had to be redone because they didn't match anymore. Also, the software used to create them had become more advanced (and hence more detail was possible).
Calls itself Final Fantasy and then does DIS
so she's boring-Vasquez

Illusion of Gaia was such a good game : (
Finding eight spiritts-- item collection. Classic FF theme. Find all the crystals/weapons/whatever to save the world.
This diary sucks! *burns it fire*
The_Blazer: People who handle sensitive information?
Good morning Shizuka. How was thou sleep?
"This leads to bed."?
You get JAILED for saying "the earth is not the center of the universe"?
I mean burns it in fire *Facehoof*
1,11See, the concept of this story is clever and interesting. But the execution is so BORING.
mishia: Yeah, that's what happened.
i can't wait for when we will all by old and all the young people will be using holograms,and we are going to say"Remember of the books ? that was some serious shit"

Darf14: :D
But they are so small PONY
Darling, you need a psychologist...
To each their own. I love this film. I have the DVD special edition.
DerpStar, "small" is not a proper term in Science
Silverscreen: would be better off as a live-action/animation hybrid rather than a full animationimo.
i rember seeing a trailer of this as a kid and i thought it was a live action movie
If you don't like it don't watch it.
miniscule PONY
Ohai James Woods.

Well, to be honest animation still holds up kinda well
sergio_scriptor Your Lack of faith disturbs me
eeyup sounds like the bad guy
Obviously explain how all their tech is so advanced?
uttery, *looks in a dictionary*
Derpstar: Because
Derpstar: just because
/me snores....
alexxm: It's hard to say he's a villain-- he's rather like many FF antagonists who thinks he's in the right despite all evidence to the contrary.
Dark92Enigma That condo was in a very proper location.....20 miles to the beach, 20 miles to downtown
^^
Tovler, false, should be looked up from Applebloom

Blow up the Earth with the Zeus cannon!
SirGanjalf: it reminds me alot of that movie "Battle for earth" when humans invaded an indigenous alien species...IT'S NOT AVATAR
As in blowing up the planet.
Death is not proper term in Science, please prefer word "Expire"
The GIGA :D
and only connection to final fantasy VII
"Rhubarb, rhubarb..."
That beam is nothing compared with the power of the Force
Kinda like what Frieza would do.
And that guy has a giant forehead.
he should have lied about the alive part
I think I know who the antagonist is...
That voice-
Or he could say it could blow up the planet
THE VOICE
They should all call Capitain Planet, Hero of Gaia
rhubarb rhubarb washing machine washing machine

OH GOD.
Your lack of faith disturbs me <.............
sergio_scriptor: Avatar was the first thinh that came up to my mind when they started speaking about "planet's spirit"

almost interesting dialogue that time
where is will smith when you need him ?! :|
DOnt rely on luck, rely on fate instead
Derpstar: No im calling that according to the film rules. Hes not an intentional Villian, just one made out to be because the movie doesnt know the diffrance
OFFICIAL NAME is DERPY DOO confirmed in Song Script!
flutterisbest: in that case I would like to examine that proof. deeply.
Aki is the hottest actres who never existed.
all at all the Stuff that isn't happening!
just look at ti!
I think the time for Will Smith has long passed sergio_scriptor
Luck is random. Fate is always-
the script of "Smile Smile Smile"
Unditermable
Im literally getting sleepy watching this =_=
So boring
He sounds like Kaidan Alenko from Mass Effect
"SO NY"?
1,11Irish_Pony: Oh, so I'm not the only one.
7th spirit, 6th element... its all the same
No Will Smith, then maybe Donald Faison?
DerpStar: i said that beacuse this new york reminds me alot from "i am the legend" new york :|
"stran them for awhile"
Wait, Derpy wasn't in Smile Smile Smile. Her only appearance in that episode was inside the snow globe.
mishia: Yes. He's a lot like game antagonists who are so damn certain that they are in the right that any evidence to the contrary is automatically wrong.
BROMANCE?~?
derpy doo.....im fine with this
I think MLP has better facial expressions than this thing...

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This was the first Final Fantasy not scored by series composer Nobuo Uematsu, the man behind the music of all ten FF games (excluding Final Fantasy Tactics, composed by Masanari Iwata/Hitoshi Sakimoto).

Cid is probably an NPC

alexxm: what did we thought about it ?
how did he like it?
Dang child safety locks!
sergio_scriptor he liked it and he's never heard of team fortress before
It could be said that Avatar is worse because it started the 3rd craze.

twilight_sprinkle: Not yet. Hind goes apeshit
SirGanjalf YES YOU ARE FUCKED, SHIT OUTTA LUCK.....NOW I'M COMPLETE AND MY C=?? U WILL S?¡=?!
Oh I see.
orite, i forgot theres one more shot in the friendship cannon
Dken2021: My face would be contorted with fear and the feeling of wet pants
One more shot, eh?
so earth has his own world spirit ? :O i wonder what it looks like
0 f__ks still given
This movie does make sense on its own terms. It lays out its plot and then ticks all the boxes in resolving it.
Evil begets more Evil
It's just that the plot is dumb.
/me inserts Batman and Robin climax
rawr =3
sergio_scriptor: All worlds have a lifestream in FF games.
Dark92Enigma-3: That.
General is full of derp
incoming mad Gaia
Question
Now friendship cannon killed the planet
Message to Villain: Stop casting Meteor!
D:
Everlasting_Joy which ''That''?
well that seemes to have helped
since only a portion of the ghosts left their planet
how many are left
The ghosts should have giggled at it.
Pinkies4thWall: well you asked for more friensdship
Overload the system. Good thinking!
Hes the SPAI
i think
Dark92Enigma-3: Evil brings more evil.
Forget Logic
why are bad guys always so dumb *_*
DerpStar: Probably quite a lot. These were just random ghosts that were linked to a chunk of their planet.
becasue dumb is... bad
In only Pinkie was around...
sergio_scriptor: They wouldn't be bad then.
sergio_scriptor: Becausr plot
sergio_scriptor: They didn't go to school to be a successful villain
bad guys arent always dumb, and hes not even a bad guy
*Because
Lifestream, why are you the wrong color?
Everlasting_Joy Oh, of course......and ''Money is not important, Only life is Important''
WATER
JUMP
dammit bobbeh, what the hell?
/me Gaia esscence of earth
Oh shiz!!
I must go. My planet needs me.
SirGanjalf: I don't think "Giggle at the Ghosties" would apply to something that could kill you ON CONTACT
Flying in space LIKE A BAWS
SPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCEEE
whee
Hi guys
You have to admit that hes very dedicated
sergio_scriptor, because they rely on their own sense of reason to guide them. They aren't spiritually aware like the heroes are.
Why are they fighting Gaia Online?
/me LET'S GET OUR POWERS COMBINED!!!!!!
Gaia is the orginal name of an "Earth Mother" or basicly the earth itself. It comes from Greek Mythology
I choose you PIKACHU!
Kandarihu: true :(
S
Old man was napping.
even the old man is bored to death
alexxm: unproductive
/me Gaia, essence of earth.........
that's great, now turn Gaia into a magicite
Yes it explains everything!
Kandarihu: i just whished that there would be a movie where the bad guy is smart and he wins,JUST 1 MOVIE :(
And that rule even applies in stories where the heroes are scientists and the villains are stereotypical religious people.
/me EARTH! FIRE! WIND! WATER! HEART!
Empire Strikes back sergio_scriptor ?
8,6see, fuck escort missions
kirz: ^
^
So this is about saving spritits- and these things are just confused
lol she fell asleep
DerpStar: it works,kind of :|
sergio_scriptor: No Country For Old Men
dream...
sergio_scriptor: Those sorts of stories rarely make money.
8,6stay there to protect them, but you can't shoot anything, and they're still trying to kill you
aki is sleeping
lol narcolepsy
screw your escort mission
kirzstryfe: Best plan ever
how convient
So basicly the good guys are murdering the sprtiits
Revenge of the Sith sergio_scriptor ?
lol kirzstryfe
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prior to the film's release, there was speculation that the photo-realistic computer-generated "actors" would revolutionize moviemaking. There were news reports of plans for the "digital actress" used for Aki Ross to appear in another movie, or possibly be included in a live-action production amongst real actors. The box office failure of this film put those plans
SirGanjalf: got see that movie someday
1,11on hold, however a special sequence created for the special edition version of the DVD, which opens disc 2, does in fact show Aki and other FF characters interacting with real people.
owch
sergio_scriptor Empire Strikes Back?
dat wall
sergio_scriptor: Audiences don't like to see evil win, except if it leads to a sequel where the bad guys lose.
Suddenly tentacles
DocSane: indeed
I already named that Dark92Enigma-2
/me SCREW THIS TEST, I'M GETTING US OUTTA HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
uhh... did it impregnate her?
Dark92Enigma-3:
Whats with all the dark enigmas???
gl
Dark92Enigma-2: empire,kind of works,sort of
DerpStar Oh, sorry :'(
:O
And then Aki was pregnant.
i have no idea what just happened
Them giant mussels
8,6acid
and then.... boobs
and now she's in the Eidolin world
almost title drop
:O
Aki had phantom cells inside of her, remember?
AGE SPOTS!
She needs you square head
/me tucks head in DoublePint chest and wimpers
Im happy for that silver. For as pretty as these are, I find tradional needs to stay as it may become a dead and dieing art
Is Aki the New EVE?????? OH NO THIS IS Narutaru AKA Shadow Star ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Can someone tell me what the grape is going on?
It found me! Via the power of "the writers were trapped in a corner" logic!
y not?
this sure is some badass graphics for 2001
Can this guy move more of his Muszzles to create emotions?
/me JUST DO IT (insert Nike symbol)
how do guns work against ghosts anyway
Rarity: SHHHH the robot police are always listening?
alexxm: Magic, (snort)(snort)
!
alexxm: Space Magic
alexxm: only god knows... :|
alexxm, it's probably the barrier in bullet form.
DO NOT TOUCH
alexxm if the guns were curing weapons and the phantoms were undead, probably
SO she was the eight spirit.........DEUS-EX-MACHINA much?
XD
Its both science and space magic
So they are killing innocent spirits?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Cid and Aki were originally grandfather and granddaughter. Aki's last name was also different: she was originally Aki Shishido. The relationship and names were changed late enough into production that many of the animators and staff didn't even know of the modification of the script until the film was nearly finished.
thanks DocSane
Full powa!!
mishia: theyre not really innocent
Wait
thats "cid"?
Any science that's sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.
mishia: cid is the science guy
I KNOW!!!
I KNOW
He knows.
I KNOW
1,11He knows.
I think he knows
See Villain, this is why you don't kick Gaia in the nuts.
WE KNOW!
Lol, who speaks to a computer?
I KNOW!
lol
Twilight_sprinkle: they said themselves that the crittiers are confused
Silverscreen: /)
Get on with it!
Fail
booom
/me is surprised that didn't become a meme.
dumbass
^
WARNING! FLASH OVERLOAD! WARNING! FLASH OVERLOAD!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Columbia Pictures' first theatrically-released animated feature since Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation.
He's very dedicated
mishia: yeah but they are tryting to kill them
derp
self-destruct
The_Blazer: Everyone. When the computer starts anooying you
The_Blazer: all of the characters from " ihave no mouth and i must scream" ? :|
villian is best dumbass
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Before Elliot Goldenthal was brought in to compose the score, the film was temp-tracked from James Horner's score for Titanic. Cues from the piece 'A Promise Kept' were borrowed for the original opening sequence and can be found on the Special Edition DVD.
I AM....VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!
Right as the Zeus cannon is falling apart, my flash is crashing.
goddamnit how is he a villain if he just gave his life to save people. hes just stupid is all
Twilight_sprinkle Innoncence is confusion or the lack of being able to tell what is right from what is wrong
12this website is pathetic
Never mind. It's back up.
I love how the only reason this dangling plot thread gets resolved is because the villain is a tremendous moron.
I don't think hes the villain since hes pursuing the same goals as the protaganists alexxm
Villains, die with Honor!
HELLFIRE
Bahamut doesn't like ya
oh shi-
12I go on options to make sure no one knows I'm online
And then everyone on board died.
Nice.
12doesn't work
darkfire!
So, how many people did he kill along with him on that space station?
Way to go James Woods.
the sound-design in this movie is so bad :(
1,11He's a villain because he purposely caused harm to get his way.
mishia: really? thats a weird definition
To the point of self sacrifice
CriticKitten: Idiots.
Why is it that 2 weeks ago you treat me like normal, I die for a while, come back and you all want me gone? What did I do?
Silverscreen: for the greater good
Villain isn't a proper term. Antagonist, however is.
Silverscreen Time for a game of dissapearing BEARS!
twilight_sprinkle: Ignorance is bliss
Meanwhile, the villain was only a basic character. The rest of the people who died were less defined than that.
let there be...LIFE!
Silverscreen: "just beacuse i wanted to enslave all of mannkind that does not make me evil :'( "
1,11Twilight_Sprinkle: So does that mean the people in HOt Fuzz weren't villains since it was for the "Greater Good"?
To save the world Silverscreen "ends justify the means" concept
soooo sleeepy -_-
Meanwhile, I understand what you mean, though.
Silverscreen: idk that movie.
mishia: I'm not sure if I buy that. Maybe that it's the state of not yet knowing what is "right" and "wrong."
twilight_sprinkle: You don't know Hot Fuzz? Dude. That film is awesome.
ok DerpStar
<3
A lot of villains use "for the greater good" as an argument in their favor.
FOR THE GREATER GOOD!
for the greater good
DON'T LEAVE ME.....DON'T MAKE ME FEEL AN EMOTION :'(
Yes you will
:(
Docsane: yes.
The Greater Good
FOR THE GREATER GOOD!
BAD touch ?
:{
Her implant ruptured.
Silverscreen here is a good exampe "Hitler just wanted to make the world cleaner and better"
FOR THE GREATEST GOOD
:[
Must.....touch......Boobs
For the Hoard!
Dark92Enigma-3: You are on fire today!
:(
:[
ded..?
Maybe everything thinks i'm roleplaying. I'm not.
FOR THE GREATER GOOD!!!
CriticKitten: yeah and imo thats not really villainy
:'(
Crying please?
everyone*
Her mouth looks like she just got braces.
Just acutally cry?
for great justice!
FOR ONCE?
Lil_B: Villains very seldom think of themselves as evil.
FOR SHIRE!
1,11Alright then. Count Dooku from Star Wars: The CLone Wars was doing his thing because he thought it was for the Greater Good. Was he not a villain for that?
twilight_sprinkle: So as long as you have a reason for being a villain, you're not a villain?
ded?
Everlasting_Joy What can i say? I feel inspired :)
/me laughed hard at "don't leave me greg"
"I know."
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In early storyboards, the character of Ryan Whitaker (voiced by Ving Rhames) was equipped with a cybernetic right arm, in what would have been a reference to the Final Fantasy VII video game.
CriticKitten: omfg would you stoptwisting everything i say. i mean that as long as they have an honest selfless reason and they think theyre helpign people, they not evil
FOR THE GREATER GOOD!!!
Silverscreen: I think that in a concept of a civil war perspectives have to be altered with regards to the factions
Ummm what?
By the power of GRAYSKULL!
No, you're a villain so long as you are acting to contravene what the "hero" is doing in a story.
Silverscreen if only that conecpt stayed...
In this case the General wants to save the world
to IMCOMPRENSIBILITY...........AND BEYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOND
Bringing about world peace by inventing a world-destroying crisis like climate change to unite the youth against the elders who can't be deceived.World peace based on a lie.
Nerom: I HAVE THE POWERRRR!
Silverscreen: count dooku was lying i think
twilight_sprinkle: Who did this guy help?
I WAS FROZEN TODAY
Seriously, what just happened?
:D
Please, point to one single person that this guy HELPED in the course of the story.
Space Magic.
Dooku was no villain
and thus the Ice age began
Elements of Harmony?
WE WERE FROZEN TODAY
sirhamjaif ohhh lordddu
Kandarihu: Oh, lord. Please don't drag real world politics into this.
CriticKitten: he THought this would help, he Honestly thought he was saving lives and he gave his own for it
1,11DerpStar: In Clone Wars, Dooku was trying to save the galaxy from the "Tyranny of the Galactic Sennate"
Obsidian: Science or Fiction. One of the two.
CriticKitten: Besides himself?
Ok then fine. Can anyone answer me this question? Do you like me on this chat or do I think I should go die in a hole? Yes or no?
Ah, I see someone finally went ahead and cast Holy.
Silverscreen: in the context of a civil war led by him
Not sure if the writers know.
Meanwhile: He didn't even do that, he killed himself because DURR OVERHEATING WUT DAT, remember?
Silverscreen: it's all about perpective
Well, it's pretty much equivalent.
Silverscreen, and what did his failure lead into?
Silverscreen: there are two ways of that, either the emperor twisted his mind to believe it, or dooku was just lying
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Matt McKenzie, who voices the Major, is the only actor in the film to have also starred in a Final Fantasy game as he would later voice Auron in Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2.
warm ice? ..... seems legit
Silverscreen: techincaly it was "tryanny" since the senate was not voted into thier place :)
Silverscreen: Not to mention he was a double agent of the Galatic Senate
Harm :)
HE WAS WARMED UP TODAY
*Warm
twilight_sprinkle: I lol'd :D
Darf14: Warm spirit
CriticKitten: Good point. Well, he did /try/ to destroy what he perceived as a hostile alien invasion that killed his family, but he was a twonk.
1,11twilight_Sprinkle: and if he really believed it, woudl that make him the enemy or a hero? He still killed and risked millions of lives for "the greater good" he believed in.
Mewtwo was no Villain either
Theres that bird again
Symbolism!
Bird!
Now, just imagine how much less of a disaster this would all have been if the Villain hadn't been so villainous.
i would tottaly join the empire,screw thye rebels
Hey birdy :D
That eagle. It doesn't care about what just happened among the humans at all. That guy's just looking for life.
Winter coming!
Yeah, it's pretty hard to say this guy wasn't a villain. Dude lied, stole, abused his authority, killed millions, and nearly blew up the planet because "aliens killed my family ;_;"
Silverscreen: If he believed and he was ready to give his own life to make others live happy then yes
Silverscreen, you can kill billions for the greater good. With that Logic, Stalin was a bad guy, but was he punished fpr his actions? Hmm?
I have this song on mp3.
How was that eagle not blown up by Zeus shockwaves?
JUST END THIS MOVIE
sergio_scriptor: Yeahhhh empire!
1,11PONY: That's exactly my point
....
it finally ended
These hills-
5.5/10
it just ended
Silverscreen, Villains are chosen by vistors
See, this is a decent song, too.
now lets see if Nobuo Uematsu is or isn't in the Credits
For the "Greater Good" of who?
so finnaly we see FINAL FANTASY hills
That eagle is an unchanging constant in this movie; a sign that after everything that happened in this movie, some things remained the same.
Silverscreen: Victors*
Neil/10
Lil_B he isn't
PONY: LOL except that stalin only desired power
Longest Cutscene ever. Bring on the Gameplay!
^:D
ERRGHHH
Sakaguchi was the Skript witer?
I repeat the General wasn't a villain in this movie he was trying to achieve what we are seing now, at the cost of minimal sacrifices versus a plan that was ridiculously far fetched
END THIS SUCK FEST
It's a shame the animation is so good and the music is pretty decent, but everything else is just so flat.
5/10
NNNNNGGGGGG
twilight_sprinkle: FOR THE GREATER GOOD :DDD
I rate this movie Science / Magic
1,11You can do stuff "for the greater good" but that doesn't excuse being the cause of horrific event or action,
Kandarihu: I think the movie already explained the point of the eagle in a simpler manner.
Silverscreen: its a matter of means vs ends.
6/10
The General, DerpStar, was a fanatic.
i don't like how it just ended
1,11HE RISKED DESTROYING THE ENTIRE PLANET.
About three facial expressions/10
at least it's still better then Doom
4/10
I wish I could stay to see the B movie. :(
Despite all the whining in chat I still enjoyed that.
5.5/10
I think this movie was more boring than footbal match between spain and portugal few days ago.. zzzz
Silverscreen, the fact still remains, Villains are chosen by the victorious, disregarding everything else
dancing to end a movie? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNp1qomWzz8&feature=plcp
EspyLacopa: That doesn't make him a villain, Patton was a fanatic but not a villain
Silverscreen: the planet was filled with Alien lifeforms he thought to be evil
Hey guys
What is the B movie?
No facial expressions/10
Silverscreen, he didn't consider the destruction of the Earth to be a possibility.
1,11He closed his mind to everything except destroying the Phantoms.
8,6Harp, no video links during the stream please
do me a favor and PING ME WHEN THE LOTTERY STARTS
Hey otakon, how you doin
:| bye, i'm going to go play tetris for the next 5 hours and eat ice cream all day instead of getting a new job.
alexxm: You mean... like a lot of Final Fantasy games, where you are honestly left with a dim sense of WTF? ^_^
B/10
kempa: HEY,im from portugal :| just kiding im not mad :)
hey otakon hows your day been
hey ther otakon :)
kempa: okay
ZEC0RA: "Tremors" from 1990.
alexxm: alrighty
so, brb
Yeah, I'm sorry if you don't agree, but the dude risked destroying the planet rather than acknowledging the very clear evidence presented by Aki that there were other options. >_>
He's a villain.
Silverscreen: can that not be said of many contemporary generals in wars past?
I love Tremors!
What made him a villain was that his only real goal was revenge, and was willing to sacrifice -anyone- who stood in his way in order to get it.
Silverscreen: well thats stupidity, not villainy, thats his mind, not his nature
Kencolt to be honest i ahven't played a final fantasy game yet
<dem singers are theh boreds
1,11So, all that youre saying justifies him destroying the entirety of what could have been humanitite's very last base of opportations, right?
OK.....to be fair, when you look at this movie from a different POV, IT's not the worst CGI movie out there, but it's still bad.....the plot and premise were creative, but the execution was TERRIBLE.....and i've never seen a more depressing ending since.........The Mist
Silverscreen: I love this song ^_^
Remember when he intentionally took down the shields on that one sector?
Silverscreen: FOR THE GREATER GOOD!
Anyway, some people are horrified by the idea of villains who believe that they're doing the right thing. I'm used to that happening. I honestly can't accept a villain who proudly proclaims how evil he/she is.
Silverscreen: These are, after all...MAN!
Dark92: I wouldn't say the plot is that creative, per se.
JERSEY LEVELS/10
this movie was pretty to watch, but pretty meh everywhere else
Silverscreen: Well the thing is and they admited it that they held on to a veryu unpopular belief
Silverscreen: how could it be their base of operations? it was filled with enemy lifeforms
Remember when he put those two scientists in jail simply for trying to find another way of saving the world?
sergio_scriptor well I am really sorry but that footbal was nothing againts ITAxGER, you have to admit it. Only the penalties were good :D
Dark92: But I agree, the animation quality is pretty amazing.
Kandarihu: Those are the best villains, the ones who are so happy to be evil.
MAN, YES MAN. HUMAN IN SHAPE BUT SATANIC IN SPIRIT-
It's just a shame it doesn't deliver more beyond that.
Silverscreen: and who said there arent other planets
Learn the facts; Good guys MAKE IRRATIONAL CHOICES
:3O3
/me is about to mimick the NOSTALGIA CRITIC
kempa: indeeed my friend,and i was so sad my country lost :'(
This movie gets a 4/10, lak of good characters, impressions ans Sounddesign
I was unable keep track of the story due to sleepiness.
/me dosent care
1,11It justifies killing hundreds of innocent and hard working people just so he can shoot that canon, despite being given an alternative that had evidential proof of working.
and poorly executed skript
Dark92Enigma-3 you remeber it so we don't have to?
Everlasting_Joy: I'm inclined to agree with Kand, commited to being a cosmic scale douchebag isn't particularly interesting motivation.
This movie gets; FOR THE GREATER GOOD/10
It amuses and saddens me that people are actually arguing about this.
Silverscreen but it wasnt a nice big gun
Silverscreen: he didnt want to kill them >stupidity, if he Wanted to kill them, he would be a villain
Silverscreen: I think it's a fine example of script-induced stupidity.
Silverscreen: he was trying at least. he was just being a retard-
Meanwhile: To each their own.
really, music, really?
Silverscreen, would you destroy the sun to prove your point?
REALLY?
Hello everyone! what film did I just miss?
sergio_scriptor yeah well your country beated my country one match earliers, so I was wishing for Spain :< :D
:):):)
4.5/10 Creative premise, terrible payoff, depressive ending
mishia that sudden up-beat XD
Everlasting_Joy: Thankyou
Don't worry SirDeDerp, you didn't miss anything special
FF Spirits within SirDeDerp
1,11It went beyond irrational choices, he closed his mind to anything other than getting his way and went out of his way to make HIS way happen.
lalli-ho SirDeDerp
Lil_B dat music thinks its so good
Silverscreen: stupidity isnt villainy, otherwise 90% of people is evil
kempa: which country was yours ? :)
Meanwhile: And to be fair, there are a few villains I love who think they're doing a good thing, but are wrong/evil.
PONY: People need the Earth to, like, live. Risking blowing it up just to kill a perceived threat is stupid no matter how you slice it.
Can't I still have the name?
oh
Silverscreen, that could happe to anyone
nvm
sergio_scriptor Czech Rep. :)
I don't mind the depressing ending, in fact I'm glad it ended like that instead of sudden deus ex love story.
lol
Silverscreen: Many people considered heros in history acted in similar ways
Accepting the viability of the alternative meant believing in something that he refused to believe in, namely Gaia. That's why pure reason and logic will never win out.
wow, london symphony orchestra Oo
Silverscreen: he was maybe arrogant but he wasnt evil, he wanted to save people and he didnt believe anyone else, he wanted to save humanity in His way
kempa: ah,in the name of my country ,im so sorry,but hey we both lost :)
Silverscreen: Well, he's an example of a character who dismisses any alternative ideas because they don't fit his preconceptions.
Dken2021 I plan to make a fanfic starring him...........and i will target the ''Elements of Harmony'' two-parter
I think the story was.... err... dang I cant remember the story of this movie >_<
Had his plan worked he would have been recognized as such
^
Silverscreen: Kind of like Twilight Sparkle, in that way.
Dark92Enigma-3 uh... interesting?
exactly, if it worked, youd all be singing a different tune.
He wasn't evil because he wasn't malicious. He was just a bad guy.
aren't bad guys in films generally evil?
he was just stupid.
Dken2021 Just a rough idea, i still need pointers
sergio_scriptor you dont have to be sorry my friend! You were better, really better, and it was nice football to watch afterall, I enjoyed it though we lost. You were like 1 whole class better than us
CriticKitten: I'm actually agreeing here in most parts... I'm just trying to say victorious choose the villains in EVERY concept and "good guys" make irrational choices too, other than that, I'm just fooling around
Still beter ending than ME3
This was an interesting film, I have to tell the truth though, I kept yawning through it
Again, a villain doesn't have to be in it just "for the evilz". Having a reason behind what you're doing doesn't excuse your actions.

All the same, the means you employ to achieve your goal are part of what makes them moral or immoral.
/me Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to. And welcome to another rendition of Raiders of the Story Arc..........(insert Indiana Jones knock-off)..........This is where I take the first few episodes of a nostalgic show and see if it still holds up. With that said, um...
Risking the planet's destruction is somewhat immoral.
Ok everypony as a woman I veto all your decisions and call him a misguided hero
I would destroy the sun to prove my point...
the end
I wonder if there is even 1 movie where the bad guy wins
now what
/me MLP:FIM
The General's goal wasn't to save the world. It was to destroy the Phantoms.
<---------------
NOW PONIES :=d
Heavy: what happens now?
Revenge of the Sith, Empire Strikes Back Darf14 just to name a few
...my kitty found a pen and is trying to eat it.
._.
sergio_scriptor lawl north korea I think after that beating they put whole footbal team in jail, you know what is north korea about, right? Hard comunism :/
Thinking about it, I don't really think we can label the dude bad or good. He was a guy in charge of a lot of military decisions in a military situation who thought he knew the situation and acted accordingly. Except for the whole "Letting thep hantoms through the barrier" thing, that was just stupid.
yay
evil=|=Villian, most evil persons are villians, but some are Villians because the want to be good but hurt others by doing so
TL;DR
about ponies, is MLP streamed here in HD?
Ponies Now?
Yay, ponies
CriticKitten: make sure the lid's on
The_Blazer, the stream isn't HD.
yaaay ponies!

SirDeDerp: I took it from him. He had put pretty big teeth marks in the pen cap.
XD
noooo laaaag :(
And the Pony eps are in the right order today

Silverscreen remember how Last RoundUp ended? b4 the credits?
AY Caramba!
20% cooler.
The stream's in 640x453 or something.
Silverscreen: he Thought he was helping, but he was wrong. at that point there was nothing left but moving forward, otehrwise his previous actions wouldve been in vain
Yay ponues
Kencolt: Being in the military long enough to get to that position tends to do that to people.
twilight sprinkle: i'm actually watching that series atm. it really is good
wait, Read it and weep was picked twice?
alexxm: I wouldn't mind a neck like that ^_^
This was my first stream episode! :D
sergio_scriptor yep i´d belive in that.. It must be hard for them
Silverscreen ''You'll pay for this Rainbow Dash''
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
SHHH twilight_sprinkle
Well, that's what mips.tv is. Other services are 640x480. But not mips

MadSurge i think it might have been mine as well

DERP
kempa: i kind of felt sorry for them,just knowing what punishment they would get when they returned home :(
PONIES.. yay :(
CriticKitten: Only because he was stupid
Seeya Everlasting_Joy.
Silverscreen This episode came right after it.....and she paid for it....unintentionally
CriticKitten: he Thought he was smart and hence right
i liek how they dont tell us her wing is broken

FORESHADOWING
sergio_scriptor Yeah possibly some forced hard labour.. :/
Love how it knows we are smart
Spiderman :D
SPIDER-Dash
:D
There's stupid, and then there's "WHAT'S OVERHEATING LOL".
D:
Stalin was a Hero, and Finland is lying... They killed all the people Stalin was about to save before he could, and Stalin forgive them and didn't kill those pesky bastards. Finland had 90% casualties of all applied military perssonel and not a single soviet was hurt during the winter war.
Spider Dash Spider Dash, does whatever a Spider Dash does
so... wait, was pony episode played after spirits within yesterday?
1,11This guy put what he wanted over what was right. He wanted to kill the phantoms for the sake of getting rid of them at any cost. What was right was to try and get rid of them in a way that didn't have negative effects, as the scientists pointed it it could have, and he refused to listen to the idea of alternative options despite everyone else accepting them simply because he didn't
1,11want them, rather than for what was right. He just pushed through for his own agenda.
Spider dash, spider dash, does whatever a spider dash does.
A ROOMMATE!
CriticKitten: I press da button and da mans fall down.
A book :)
mishia : :D
*squee*
''I own all of them *squee*'' I <3 Twi!

twilight_sprinkle: The thing about Code Geass is it's the story of a hero who will always be seen as a villain by his world.
NNNNNGGGGGG
"Books! God, I love books!"

I'm off for now, I'll be back in about an hopur or so :)

SirDeDerp: Pretty good logic there in reality i think that would be quite true :D
twilight's raep faec
lol
CriticKitten: he isnt seen a villain by me, nor is the black coat guy
Dark92Enigma-3 I dont have soul
FAIL D:
:(
twilight_sprinkle: The character was designed to be a villain. He risked the planet in a game of chance so that he could play with his giant phallic symbol of a weapon. All he needed was a twirly mustache and an evil laugh. :p
Finland.. such a silly country
CriticKitten: i put intentions Before results
kempa AHHHHHHHHHH!

See that Zeus Cannon? Phallic symbol. :|
1,11Life, Death, Life, Death Life Death Life Death Life Death Life Death Life Death
CriticKitten: i dont think he was designed to be a villain, FF has many characters like him who arent evil, its called complexity
TOCK..

Daring Do Spin-off
Hi CrimsonPhoenix
Who would watch it
I like this because this is a refrance to "rainbow dash reads" plus a awesome book sceane
CrimsonPhoenix hey :P/)
You know what? I just realized there's a second angle to what motivated him. He had that cool Zeus Cannon, and he WANTED to use that thing. This might have been less a case of the Ends Justify the Means, as the Means Justify the Ends.
OMG A CAT! :O
I'm the best predator. :3
I always liked how daring do is just a rainbow dash recolor.
She challenges Aztec demons and doesn't afraid of anything
CATS :O
O_O
LOL
FALSE! Predators don't make a sound when stalking their prey!
/me inserts Indiana Jones theme song
Poor little cat
da du dun dan. da du dun
Well not untill the predtor is about to eat them
Dark92Enigma-3 Oh I see.. okay
FUN FACT: there exists indiana jones adventure novel books,they are called "the adventures of young indiana jones"
CriticKitten: he put the lives of all of humanity before individual lives, there wasnt really a case where he couldve helped someone much
Cutie mark: Compus
Kandarihu: Like how people buy a BBQ and then invite the neighbourhood over every day for a few weeks to validate the purchase to themselves?
Why didn't she fly .__.
Daring have a brokeng wing?
FUN FACT: there exists indiana jones adventure novel books,they are called "the adventures of young indiana jones" :)

O_O
I'M AN EGGHEAD!!! A TRUE EGGHEAD
but she's cool anyway
ponies be ponies. i'd watch it all
dat crocs xD
The_Blazer: That's the point.
twilight_sprinkle: I can think of one. He found that video of Aki's dreams and could have just presented that to the council as evidence that his way was better. INSTEAD, he chose to lower the barriers and lie about it to make SURE they'd choose his way.
1,11Ceiling Gators, your argument is invalid.
AND PEOPLE SAY THIS IS FOR WITTLE GIRLS!

mishia b-but it's for everyone...
Silverscreen: even after the ape sound?
twilight_sprinkle: That is a decidedly evil choice of actions that could have been avoided entirely.
Just went for a glass of soda. My entire family turned their heads from the comps/Ios dev they played travan on and said join us. Creepy as hell O.o
monkey
Meanwhile, that analogy is pretty much spot on in the case of a lethal chef who overcooks everything. Wiping out the bacteria at any cost.

twilight_sprinkle: He had all the "evidence" he needed and could have stopped there.
terrible laggs.. Am I allone?
DAT horse sound
CriticKitten: i think that after he lost his family he shut himself off from individual lives and focused on the greater good. its certainly debatable, and a good complex chartacter
*horse snort*
Whoo
lol

kevin bacon's so young in this
SuperBrony64, dem summer odds, they are getting better.

He ded.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Was originally given an "R" rating by the MPAA not for violence but for language. As an appeal, producers removed all utterances of the "f" word, with the exception of one - when Kevin Bacon says "Fuck you" to the dead graboid.
and its bufering...are you serious

1 down 2 to go
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Composer Robert Folk was brought in at the very last minute to re-score the film. This was due to the original score composed by credited composer Ernest Troost was lacking the punch that it needed for the film musically. Approximately thirty minutes or more was written by Folk and strangely goes uncredited in the film's credits.
Marx: Awesome, isn't it?
I know!
little winged raptors~

SuperBrony64: danke again
13Pancaaake :P

I'm ok, Viri
OK... that was darn classy. I switched to the Fausttalk, (seen this film a dozen times so...) and at the end she was presented with an insane picture-- I just KNOW it'll hit EQD by tonight.
is there a game where you stay on rocks to avoid being eatin by worms
I'm not flat ;w;
14AEEEE
wow, Lauren Faust really IS awesome.

07Angel_Umbreon
Midnight_Fyre I think I remember playing but I dont know where
It's basically theFausticorn head-- drawing ITSELF-- and the logo CREATE.
07i wish i had an explanation to my sleep issue.
07going to bed very soon because no matter if i am dead tired or no, i wake up at 6am..
Kencolt, that picture has been in the internet for a god long while
I've seen it before
10Because of the midnight sun you spoke of?
13My sleeping pattern is basically broken xD
1,11Swapping the embed out to something else.
14o.o
So I can finally devote my full attention to the movie again and it dies on me
Has it? Not that I had ever seen. Certainly not framed and nearly six feet tall.
Also cool Sky
13if I don't have to get up early for anything the next day, I can easily stay awake until past 5am and sleep until 2-4pm
framed and nearly six tall yeah that was good
12DID I WAKE YOU UP
12I SORRY
07Skylands, ever since my boyfriend went to Cali, my body has been in sync with teh timezone there..
and I was happy THAT was the picture
13if I have to get up earlier, I still go to sleep at like 2-3am regardless .w.
13SOITAL
07regardless of me trying or not, and I wake up when he's around, and feel tired when he goes to bed, which happens my daytime..
13BE GENTLER NEXT TIME KK

07and i don't havea logical explanation for this
14yay colors
14:D
07it makes me sound ridiculous
Eeyup-Big MacIntosh
If by extreme lag you mean a constant buffer, well. he's trying to switch embeds.
13it's silly cuz I heard we were finishing an hour earlier than usual today for stocktaking
Wich means?
11,02Go ahead and refresh the embed :)

The_Blazer: I may check them out. I've only seen this one and love it.
Stuff the critics.
geez
Silverscreen: -lol I thought pipe bombs had time detonators? Not fuses.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "elephant gun" used by Burt to kill the Graboid in his basement is a Belgian-made William Moore & Co. 8-gauge shotgun.
The critics only appreciate sad, drama movies
i still don't get why they make them pipebombs out of pvc pipes
Silverscreen: -lol wait nevermind. L4D2
you can make it so pipebombs have timers or fuses
So much cussing...
the critics can go screwthemselfs this is epic

HURRY UP DAMMIT!

30tons of STEEL!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Burt Gummer's wall of guns had to be completely rebuilt many times as the wall of guns scene was filmed in different locations.
burt is best descion maker
Where are explosive tipped crossbow bolts when you need them? ^_^ hehe
Ain't life a bitch?
Iron_Edge, they don't have the means to build timers. But they could do fuses.
To infinity!

FIRE IN THE HOLE!
Pipe bomb, incoming!!!
EAT THIS
:O
damn
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "graboids" are very reminiscent of the giant worms in Dune. Both are giant worms, live underground, live in the desert, have large mouths on the end, and respond to vibrations on the surface. Also, both films have the characters escaping the worms by retreating to rocks where they can't get attacked.
NNNNEVERRRRR
oh yea, I saw this film before, kinda forgot some bits of it.
damyun
aliens: nom nom nom!
Know what this vaguely reminds me of because of it's 80s feel? The movie series Critters.
Pipe bomb out.
Household chemicals
seems legit
Silverscreen: apparently they got ideas from the Mongolian Death Worm...which is also a movie on Sci Fi Channel
Silverscreen: not to mention the book" it came from the desert" that features giant ants instead of worms
AgentKalim: consider WHICH household we're talking about tho
alexxm CM PUNK PIPEBOMB!
And does that Burt the Kwizatz Haderach?
Aliens:pipe bomb delicious! Want more!
well he did say its weighs 30 tons
FairysHuff: same here, we should watch Critters here
pardon my french
otakon everythings a sci-fi channel movie
This movie reminds me of that movie "Signs", the one with Mel Gibson.
This is terrible, yet I can't stop laughing: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/179142_331062906978200_691146167_n.jpg
hen3ry: Point taken. :P
I LOVE THIS PLAN!
otakon: suggest it to the mods then everyone will vote.
RAWRity: Pfft.
I'M GLAD TO BE APART OF IT!
Melvin just kill yourself damn it
AgentKalim: you would wonder how easy it is to create explosives out of hosehold stuff
RAWRity: :D
kid shoots himself...
Melvin? Useful?! :O
Melvin should'nt be holding a gun
he is happy beacuse he's got a gun :)
RAWRity: awwwww god man

Melvin, run to a different rock.

THROW MELVIN AT THEM!
but little girl's gun, that one has ammo, cause she's responsible
well if he gave him a loaded one he would fire it and attract attention
Throw MEG i mean MELVIN AT THEM
Save point reached, saving...
Graboids scream like the vampires of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure?

USS_Sulaco: Yeah, fortnight ago.

Vordox: you're not? What're you doing on here then? >_>

Mario disagrees with everything. :P
This whole game was hax on the NES. And it was a launch title.
Meanwhile: Enjoying the comnuity
community*
it's that moustaches
>:T
Vordox: ...I don't even know.
Believe it or not... I haven't changed.
Meanwhile: One can be just as much part of the whole community but doesn't want to use the term brony for it
all the leaders have one
Before I was into the community, I was the same as I am now
gravity<-- mario
yolo<--- mario
killerpony7733: But isn't that kinda the point?
creepy SirGanjalf

SirGanjalf: aaaaaa wtf

Luigi----> mario

SirGanjalf for the love of god kill it
there we go finally
MARIO HAS A GODDAMN PLAN!
A GODDAMN PLAN!
t-bag?
teabag the coins
"I like (everything about the fandom) but I am not a brony."
From the beginning, the hardware was never designed for scrolling. That's why this and a few earlier platformers could only scroll right and not left.
Dance, Mario dance
Yes, hump the numbers!
LIKE A BOSS
thank you turtlegod
JUST DANCE
T Bag to the music~
Meanwhile: I don't call myself a brony but in every sense of it i would be one i just don't want to be a *brony* i'm a fan of the show like any other and still part of the community
Mario has got some moves
Drinky_Kraw tis fine
amount of coins: MARIO
He's doing it in time to the music?
killerpony7733: Something like me
mission begins in 100 M second

SuperBrony64: THE WARP MAN GET TO THE WARP!
Speed dance nao!

DERPY DOES NOT APPROVE
I'm at the survey site...but I cannot choose if I am a brony or not...
SirGanjalf: dat wall for nothing?
SirGanjalf: file not found
derpy aproves now
5% of bronies are hipster bronies, okay who's a hipster here?
ah lol
I'm sorry, but this is actually not a rhythm game...
NAIL BITING SHIT RIGHT HERE
WARP ZONE 4 GO!
dat music
Vordox: Yeah i just don't see a sense in the term brony since it's just a fancy word for fan of *insert what ever here*
so much nostalgia
Warp ALL the zones.
I'm not a hipster, hipsters are too mainstream
Yay, I think the verifying integrity of game content worked, no more giant red errors for me.
How luigi does that? Through a weegie board ofcourse.
FLYING. TURTLES.

FORGET THE GAME! LOOK AT THE STARS
SirGanjalf: once again, creepy

Wait... HE CAN SWIM FOREVER
/me is such a rebel
Bowser: lets replace the water with water colored acid
but if he FALLS in water he DIES?
otakon: not if the water is just a picture of water
Inb4 a pit.
RockingRazor52: that's it
USS_Sulaco its not fail it its on purpose
He can swim in water if it's a water stage.
and AGAIN!
Mario died happy xD
Mario --> Tank
Kandarihu: it still makes no sense!
Is SuperBrony64 playing?
This gets fixed in Mario 3
D:
I must be one bad turtle if I'm laughing at mario dying...Well you can't spell man slaughter without laughter, Can't you.
So the voice over pannel is next? How was the Artist panel?
i figured out why he died in the water
Er, Super Mario Bros 3
dat mushroom iz a spy!
i never got why water kills you in some levels when he can swim in others or am i thinking of a differant mario game
oni_link: no idea, we're watching SuperBrony64 stream
Bowser: lets make blue lava
alexxm: enope, I brought up the same point
otakon: I see
and replace the water with it
Wate you fall in...KILLS! Water you SWIM in, your FINE!
so when mario dives
like a boss
BOING

This franchise inspired many to do magic mushrooms.
It's water colored acid

Scrolling smoothly in every direction was mostly mastered as of this game. Music that doesn't compete with sfx for channels wasn't accomplished by then.
stalin it is!
Oh you dirty bastard..
PICK. A. BOX.

mario has made many enemies
Right in the nostalgia
It's getting really to late, gotta go. Bye guys
WOOT!

Mario wouldn't make so many enemies if he didn't murder everyone he came across.
maybe he is getting 2 whistles to get to the last level Stonegaze
communist or capitalist?
Nuclear waffles.

DAMNIT! No one's paying attention to me any more!

Derpio
Er, you can just hope it will spit you outs

I like bananas.
dat whistle
and the number 98.
Aw yeah. Underground theme.
you have two whistles. why aren't you using them?
all the secrets
sprites who are defeated have noclip capabilities
oh man I love dis game
he needs more gas to 'toot' them
... Mario is a pegasus?
MLG
oh, just getting the whistles for prestige and not for the shortcut to the last level SuperBrony64?

funny how no one has replied afte I said how do I make my life better.
:P
:[
PLAY!
:'(
:P
moar episodes please
turtlegod98: Easy. Ignore everything negative anyone ever says about what you enjoy and just enjoy it.
SuperBrony64: You awake?
nope
im half asleep
Is there meant to be something streaming?
Did he dieded?
I ignor everything in life. no fun.
Well, you have to stand up for what you love.
Whatever that might be.
turtlegod98: It's either that or get into arguments with idiots over nothing
who is streaming?
turtlegod98: no one can tell you precisely what you need to do. You need to decide on a goal for yourself and do everything you can to accomplish it
SuperBrony64
is
is?
I'll bet he's out getting something to eat.
yup
operatorPony: Aparently no one. I just have some weird netflix screen freeze
and thats the short version. I'm kind of doing a minor workout
It's not a freeze. His Wii is idle.
ive got a question...
what is sleep?
Kandarihu: Well now I want to watch a western O_o
ponyloverforeva: something to do with closeing your eyes
ok...
turtlegod98: If you want to make your life better, i'll start by eliminating what makes your life worse and how you do that depends on what it is
Well, now I want to watch the next episode of Bob's Burgers before going to sleep.
same
ponyloverforeva: Sleep is the thing that makes all the bad stuff in reality go away.
I do. I want to make music but their are two things blocking my path. 1 is me not knowing how to play any intruments (but that can be overcomed) and 2 is I have no money to afford ANY musical instrument. I'm put in a deep hole in the earth and i'm still trying to crawl out of it. So far it's a losing fight.
FairysHuff: but arnt there night mares to scare you in your sleep?
OH GOD
What? :P
BRONYCON AUCTION, TWILIGHT CANNON!
ponyloverforeva: Nightmares aren't real. And fear is only an emotion. Reality is hard, cruel and very very physical. I prefer sleep
i know
It moved@
Also I can't make good videos.
Suddenly Burgers
turtlegod98: a) don't stop fighting. get a job. if you're that far in debt I'm pretty sure there are programs to help, but I dont know them off the top of my head. 2) if you dont have an instrument I believe there are music programs that can emulate instruments
yay its back on!!
The Horse.... Renderer?
I couldn't read the last word on the right building
O.o
The Horse Renderer, right beside the burger place.
I'm 14. can't get a job

It's summer. Mow lawns.

Oh I know I was joking

Heh one of my friends Allison who runs Equestria Forums is at Bronycon and she said she's had the best day ever. They haven't posted pictures so I wonder if something cool happened to her, like if she met de Lancie or something. The suspense is killing me

In all seriousness, Furries are alright. Fun people, most of them. There was a Brony meatup in Anthrocon.
There it was again in the background
Rex_Mundi: I know, I have nothing against furries. It's always the vocal minority that ruins shit for everyone.
Im a bit of a furry myself, not my biggest interest, but whateves. The lifestylers are a bit weird.

ah ok
AttackWithHugs: Yes he did. During one of the presentations, you were able to hear him say stuff for people. He actually said they are clearly not ready to become true men to me.
Tara's probably best person involved in the show interacting with the fandom (Well I mean de Lancie's cool for doing the documentary, but he doesn't do the crazy fun interactions that Tara does)
icybeauti: Lol.

I got interviewed for the doc. Find the girl in the only other applebloom outfit.

I held out on DVD for a while as well

11,02Hello?
play something!
no
but not as long though
icybeauti: i'm thinking worse, however, apparently the first wasnt that well received audience wise. i feel this new one is sticking less to the actual comic and just trying to be more mainstream...which disappoints me
hai Sumica
Bronypalooza in 12 minutes
00,10ohhi
hai to you to SuperBrony64
11,02:3
Ingwaz: That's hollywood for you.

Hi Sumica
hey SuperBrony64
hai to everyone here
anyone here have any writing experience? I'm writing something on FiMFiction and could use a bit of help
SuperBrony64: PLAY HETALIA!
/me is now listening to Family Guy Rock Lobster
Hmmm, I just heard from a guy from Bronycon who got those pony training cards says they say that Twilight's library is called "Golden Oaks"
Ghost30k: I don't writ pony fic yet, but I've been writting.
NNNUUUUU
Ghost30k: help with what specifically?
Well, thanks for streaming, SuperBrony64
Wing man.
icybeauti: ahh cool
Now what are we going to watch?
JESmith71: They were selling cards by the box
11,02Np Kandarihu :)
G'night everypony.
More Smash Brothers?
someone else stream something
Ghost30k: i don't normally write short stories, not really my thing, but I am an english major
Sure why not :P
Ingwaz: i don't know constructive critidsm
well, i'm going to bed soon.
I really really regret all of that drama I caused.
i came back... so what are we talking about
bye ZappyTheUnicorn
11,02Night ZappyTheUnicorn :)
Ghost30k: give me a link and if its not too long i'll look it over
Bye, ZappyTheUnicorn
Round and round it goes
Those spinning discs
Ingwaz: not a short story hell no I'm planning maybe a 30 chapter story
I was a grade SS jerk during the movie
Ghost30k: That's just when someone really critiszes something piece by piece.
YUSSS
Night SuperBrony64, alexxm, and AgentKalim. :)
Smash bros? seems legit.
Ingwaz: I'm still waiting the approval of the story
See ya'll later.
Ingwaz: :(
Ghost30k: what are you hoping to get constructive criticism on then?
00,10So I ran across mods for ssbb today.
meta knigh as pony.
Audi famam
00,10How would you even add them.
Illius
Sumica: requires a modded console
kirby <3
I like the misheard lyrics for this
/me sings along
What language is the title theme in anyway?
00,10ahh
I don't know all the lyrics. :P
Ingwaz: the story, it's just you can't view it on FiM fic
Spade-Magnes[R]: Latin, obviously. :P
Oh yeah, you mean that Homebrew Channel thing?
00,10Flutershymarth looked kinda cool
Ghost30k: well, whats the story about? a basic synopsis
I don't know how to approach lag-related issues from now on. All I know is that I shouldn't do what I did today.
Ingwaz: here i'll pm it to you
Ow, my braces... X.X
CloudNine: Just got them on?
I still dont see how Meta Knight is broken
The only Smash broes I ever played was the first one on 64
A lot of people had lag, and all I could say is that I wasn't lagged.
/me MEGAPUNCHES Discipline into Kids
I just never play that well with him
Who wants meta knight as a pony? because that would be one sick looking pony
Spade-Magnes[R]: Combatility, survival, speed, all of it
AHHHH BUCK YEAH
icybeauti: No, they just keep pinching my cheek... X.X
Yeah, just turn everything into ponies. :P
CloudNine: How long do you have to wear them?
03LOL "That was very kind of you. You're very... decent"
Including Pikachu
pretty much
03Best way to hit on a girl ever
/me runs
:3?!
/me watching the movie Source Code
icybeauti: Not sure...
It was supposed to show Meta Knight's ship getting captured
Ghost30k: having trouble with the pm?
So you went and fixed it for everyone else and some of the people had lag who didn't have it before. And my lag was terrible.
CloudNine: Still, it'll be worth it when you get them off and your teeth look kick ass.
XD
Four ways to play, but the Gamecube controller is the only good one
^
does anyone actually use the wii controler in smash bros? Or does everyone use the gamecube controler?
Ingwaz: no i was just typing it out
Why are we watching how to play?
I use the classic controller
Anyway, I tried to bring this up, but nobody noticed it.
noname: I used GCC most of the time, but I was decent with the remote and nunchuck
wow i should try to become staff so i can show me playing revelations
SuperBrony64: Get Project M already :P
:D
11,02GanondorfKidDisiplin: Maybeh :3
I would love to join the mod squad. But I don't know if I'd have time to do 9 hour streams.
OVERWHELMING!
night guys
OH YEAH, HEEEYAAAAAAAAAAAAH
bye alexxm
Project M = The salvation of competative Brawl
Project M?
:T
Spade-Magnes[R]: Yep
What's Project M?
11,02You don't have to stream if you don't want to as a Mod, but even if you do want to, you can stream for as short as 30 min if you want :3
http://projectm.dantarion.com/
-_-
Isnt that what Other M was code named?
xD
That would be cool. But I don't have all the webcam software and stuff :P
i regret trading in my wii for a ps3.
I gave up when I was in that grey area between going too far to get my problems addressed, but not going far enough to successfully gain attention.
Wait.. I can stream without being a mod, SuperBrony64 ? :P
03this is... interesting
Sound?
11,02I said as a Mod silly :)
Same reason all the characters breathe in space in the Star Fox stage. Or how Mario breathes in space in Galaxy.
?
sound just went full derp
No reason they just can
My friend would love to stream. She would do drawing like wrek
oh.
Also how can Sonic breath in space but not under water?
PRINCES SPEACH!
:3
Mr. Gayman watch
Not Mr Game and Watch!
is he OPed?
He's so bloody hard to play as
11,02You can join the game if you want :)
PLAY AS PEACH!
He should play with Zelda or even snake,
That makes it all the more rewarding. :P
Well in Generations he can but you need that Red Ring Power Up
why does no one like mr.game & watch :(
oh dis place...
Classic Sonic is so weird using the Homing Attack
LA LA LA
>:3
wtf is happening?
This looks modded
A battle of clones
Clone wars :P
When I would play with my brothers, we never used items.
But seriously you can just break Classic Sonic stages with the homing attack
I've also wanted to stream too. But I'd have to wait at the end of a long line of other people who would like to stream. And by the time my turn comes up, something terrible will force the mods to stop allowing non-mods to stream.
Aaaaaaaa, ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE INTERNET IS DOWN!
IT BEGINS
Spade, yeah and the fact that in the 3DS version you get the Homing Attack in the story and you have to use it in the later stages to get through
What's happens? Why can't I watch the steam?!
almost everything?
It's a hot day. The electrcity is screwy.
Reddit and Livestream are down
Everything expects Google and Youtube for some reason! I don't know why!
Kind of messes up the point of playing as Classic Sonic
And I think Instagram is still down
Well its still interesting to use
Its just odd
LA
This is one awesome stage.

Any idea why I can't see the steam?

No...no luck.
I still remeber this from nin10doh "What, I bet you 20 pieces of gogurt none of you know what fire emblem is!"
For the last time, OctaviaxScratch is NOT canon.
damm
I wonder if their going to use a different art style for Link for smash 4
THERE'S A SMASH 4?!?
They should.. even thoguh I wont pay it
More likely they will have 3 different links
I see no point in OctaviaxScratch
there's going to be a smash 4 for Wiiu AND 3ds
Dayum
...
Sinistar?
Dark Pit for Smash 4
wtf is that!
Spell-of-Gaming: i see no point in the whole idea of those cards
It looks like isnistar
I want it!
sinistar
Spade-Magnes[R]: Pit is Sexah
also, even though it's under the watch of Sakurai, the studio making it is Namco bandai
its andross
XD
Wub Wub Wub
/me sits on SuperBrony64
also, WATERMELON TO THE FACE
I'm tired of clones. :I
Dark Pit needs to have his own voice clips
Also, it's unlikely Dark Pit will be on the 4th game.
ITs liek an Octopus fro mthose old TIGER electronic games

They making the next Smash? Great, in my honest opinions, add Shadow the Hedgehog, Megaman, and Rayman into the roster, and replace Lucario with Zoroark since it's the Unova genration of Pokemon.

11,02The next Smash Bros is being co-developed by Namco-Bandai :)
Spade-Magnes[R]: MOTHER characters, mostly.
Jim: you will have to talk to muffin0 about that when he gets on
So who do you think would be a good pokemon addition to Smash 4?
Doing the Up+b move on the bridge and not noticing the bomb that was going to blow up that section of bridge.
Jim: i thinik he said he got it
lol im playing Skyrim right now
I'm not gonna lie, from 10:00-12:00 was fun from 1:00-4:00 was so boring I has to leave.
@SuperBrony64, there were playing Brawl there, too.
Bandanna Dee for Smash 4
GO DERPY!
Poor Lawnmover Man...
...Still, hilarious.
:P
Holy shit
derpy actually got a smash for once
And Ult. Marvel v.s. Capcom 3, SF4, Pony Kart, and two other pony games. They even talked about MLP Online.
Is there any difference between Toon and regular links Final Smash?
smoooooth derpy
NOPE.
Derpy isnt doing too well
Balance, of course
So i'm guessing the weather's bad?
Dat Knock-up Stream?
go Derpy_Hooves !
underdog ftw
ponies of war 3. Friends till the end.
Oh hi King of Red Lions
Did anyone here go to Bronycon?
Plus, Toon Link is lighter

BALLS
LWAL
Stop wasting the smash ball
Double KO
The people from Equestria Daily were there, too.
I don't know what is going on in the steam since it's maintenacing...
gg
Oh hi custom robo
11,02gg :)
So, SuperBrony64, did you have the Power Portal fixed already?
VenHur96, are you using the applejack channel?
11,02Spell-of-Gaming: No :/
But judging by the coments...I guess you guys are playing Brawl...
Tomb Link
d3rb: No, but brb, worth a try.

Well, I'm gona go to bed now. It's been nice talking to you all. until then. night everpony!
Sure.. sure...
No Items, Fox only, Final destination
Ugh! Twilight is also not working...at least for me.
hmmm, gotta another browser you could try?
Lauren Faust reveled that Applebloom original name was "Appleseed" and there were no CMC only Applebloom herself.
SuperBrony64: have you ever won a tournament on SSBB?
I'm on RainbowDash
I'm using Chrome at the moment.
Derpy...
that should work, weird
hey all
You completly missed
MASF123: The "Appleseed" thing is pretty old, but the CMC thing is pretty new
oh neat
Spell-of-Gaming: Actually thats been on this trivia page I have for a while
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5xqyoTb651r3xauuo1_1280.png
hmm
Also Zecora had a different name and was supposed to play a bigger role, but she said the idea got dropped.
Hi APS! Sorry about the stream, somehow Livesteam is maintancing due to harsh weather.
HEY GUYS! I've got internet here! So I can stay in contact so....HELLO EVERYPONY! :)

Bye Meanwhile.
Meanwhile: cya :P
SuperBrony64, any plans to stream another game?
At the risk of belabouring my point: Mr. Gayman Watch!
Any character seems cheap if you know how to use him well
Night Meanwhile
Meanwhile, see ya
SuperBrony64: I wanna see some kid disciplining...please do alittle Ganondorf. =3
So really I never understand the banning of characters and the like
Any character can be unfair if someone knows how to use it very well
OH god, brbrbrspam

Thank you for the stream, SuperBrony64
10Parents are watching TV, sis and I are in our rooms
SSBB's Isle Delfino is either imported, or the developers had THAT much patience to rebuild it.
thanks for stream SuperBrony64 :)
SuperBrony64: I FORGOT
/me glomps SuperBrony64
bai SuperBrony64 :4
:3
10and it wasn't just the little beep for when the batteries are out of juice, it was the real thing
Thanks for streaming
So any ideas for potenteal Smash 4 stages?
11,02O.O
/me hugs Bronysith back :3
Maybe they should add a Galaxy Stage
11,02^
Thanks for streaming.
They probably will.
Good Egg Galaxy or that one with the Mario 3 Overworld tune.
I didn't watch, but thanks SB :3
11,02They should add a stage that switches between all the stages every minute or so
I am disappoint. There is no pratchett-styled whooves yet.
SuperBrony64: Oh god..no
11,02Call it 'Smash Museum'
SuperBrony64: they should make a stage of equestria
I didn't get to see what was going on due to the maintancing, but thanks anyways, SB64!
11,02Np ^-^
If Namco/Bandai is co-developing the next Smash Bros, I wonder if we're going to see SRW OG characters in it?
I has a strange feeling they're adding Tamagotchi or Digimon characters...jk jk.
02LOL
11,02CHALLENGER APPROACHING...
11,02Pac-Man!
I hope to see NOT A SINGLE TEKKEN or anything in Smash Bros...
Wakka wakka wakka
SuperBrony64: want some food? or a drink?
Megaman needs to be in smash bros
03so BlueFlare I bought that Panasonic camera
Digimon could work depending on who it is. Then you could finally fight a Digimon vs a Pokemon
He certainly isnt doing anything right now <.<
That "Smash Museum" idea sounds pretty cool.
02oh nice
02do you like it so far?
11,02Final Smash: Power Pellet = "Turns all enemies blue and makes them super weak while you grow 2x your size"
So how is this for an idea. One of Dr Whooves' machines blows up in his face.
03It'll be here on Monday...
That's a good Final Smash concept...
11,02Bronysith: Okie :3
By day he is normal
02oh
By night he becomes a suave sadist who insists on being called "Tim-eh Turn-uh"
Kerblings for Smash 4
