The only thing I actually didn't like about Spirits within were the Characters (especially the stupidity of the Bad-Guy, firering the cannon even after he saw that he was wrong) and really broing middle... I just wasn't enjoing the movie, it had a lot of flaws
hey

Aka, A movie. With the words "Final" and "Fantasy" in the title for no other reason than milking it.
I got my pizza, got my Spirits Within and I'm doped upto the eyeballs with painkillers. I'm good to go ^_^

Dooku was no villain
and thus the Ice age began

Not sure if the writers know.
Well, it's pretty much equivalent.
warm ice? ..... seems legit
Harm :)
HE WAS WARMED UP TODAY
*Warm
1,11twilight_Sprinkle: and if he really believed it, woudl that make him the enemy or a hero? He still killed and risked millions of lives for "the greater good" he believed in.
Mewtwo was no Villain either
Symbolism!
i would tottaly join the empire,screw thye rebels
Winter coming!
I have this song on mp3.
JUST END THIS MOVIE
1,11PONY: That's exactly my point
....
it finally ended
These hills-
5.5/10
it just ended
See, this is a decent song, too.
now lets see if Nobuo Uematsu is or isn't in the Credits
That eagle is an unchanging constant in this movie; a sign that after everything that happened in this movie, some things remained the same.
Neil/10
PONY: LOL except that stalin only desired power
Longest Cutscene ever. Bring on the Gameplay!

Hey guys
No facial expressions/10
1,11He closed his mind to everything except destroying the Phantoms.
do me a favor and PING ME WHEN THE LOTTERY STARTS
B/10
Yeah, I'm sorry if you don't agree, but the dude risked destroying the planet rather than acknowledging the very clear evidence presented by Aki that there were other options. >_>
He's a villain.
<dem singers are theh boreds
Remember when he intentionally took down the shields on that one sector?
Dark92: I wouldn't say the plot is that creative, per se.
this movie was pretty to watch, but pretty meh everywhere else
Remember when he put those two scientists in jail simply for trying to find another way of saving the world?
Dark92: But I agree, the animation quality is pretty amazing.
It's just a shame it doesn't deliver more beyond that.
Learn the facts; Good guys MAKE IRRATIONAL CHOICES
:3O3
I was unable keep track of the story due to sleepiness.
/me dosent care
and poorly executed skript
It amuses and saddens me that people are actually arguing about this.
really, music, really?
REALLY?
:):):)
1,11It went beyond irrational choices, he closed his mind to anything other than getting his way and went out of his way to make HIS way happen.
PONY: People need the Earth to, like, live. Risking blowing it up just to kill a perceived threat is stupid no matter how you slice it.
Can't I still have the name?
oh
nvm
lol
I think the story was.... err... dang I cant remember the story of this movie >_<
Had his plan worked he would have been recognized as such
^
exactly, if it worked, youd all be singing a different tune.
aren't bad guys in films generally evil?
he was just stupid.
This was an interesting film, I have to tell the truth though, I kept yawning through it

In memory of Jack
PONY: Oh I know that. History is just a record of the winners.
people commit evil for evil's sake...
Hawkieeeee
hiii
yeh?
oh
:3
lol
1,11Good guys make irrational choices. But they don't justify themselves when those irrational choices have devistating effects, nore do that use that as an excuse to make MORE irraltional choices that can have just as many detrimental effects.
Risking the planet's destruction is somewhat immoral.
