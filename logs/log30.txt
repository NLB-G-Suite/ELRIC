Congratz~
5What's so great about shinies anyways? :|
5(Lol I kid. Congrats.)
They're shiny
/me 7offers RP4L an Unusual Hat.
12There rare
5Yeah, but other than that?
12Sorta
7They're* (sorry).
4Thank you! She's female, and her name is Glory
7And if you're wondering, my night daze is currently over.
What's the point in diamonds?
4Dialga
They're rare and they're shiny.
5There isn't one. They're overpriced and the miners who dig them up are underpaid.
It was just an analogy as you asked the point of shiny pokemon.
12*There
/me runs
12I know it's they're
4Pidgey pidge pidge
Surprisingly interesting.
5;D
5That's why I don't own any diamond jewelry... I have a few amethyst pieces but that's because my folks got them for me.
You're starving the poor diamond miners! :P
4FALCON PAWNCH
5But there are like 9000+ other people who buy diamond jewelry all the time. =P
12True
I thought diamond prices were just kept artificially high by pretty much one main company restricting supply anyway?
Unless that was something else.
04huh.
12Interesting. I’ll have to look into that
12Diamonds are only rare because of how hard it is to mine them I think
5Well, they're also rare minerally.
5But I dunno. I'm no expert. /shrug
"The topic typically comes up when the diamond shopper makes a comment about De Beers owning vast supplies of rough diamonds and keeping diamond prices artificially high."
5Huh!
5How 'bout that.
5Always the strangest conversations over here at TST Chat. xD
4New topic: Birds
12Indeed
6I see peoples! :D
I'm fairly sure that's illegal here, the competition comission would be onto them, or so I would have thought.
4I need a pet bird
Then go and buy one?
Holy shiz
4The thing is, I don't have enough space in my house D :
12I like little birds the most
Pizza.
I have it.
12But they need a lot a space too
12Follow me...
5I want to get a pet fish, since a fish is the only kind of pet I can have in my dorm this fall.
12of*
6Why..?
5I'm thinking of getting a Betta. Anyone ever had them?
12Nope
Betta are easy to take care of
5Or **one, whatever.
12I found a way into Narnia
as long as you only have one.
lol
5Well obviously.
5Otherwise they'll fight each other. D:
4Finches, especially. I'm looking into a small conure or parakeet, trust me, I'm good with birds. And Roleplay, beta are great fish.

No, you have to love and tolerate the **** out of them.
You're doing it wrong.
Who is this "Prince Dari" person?
+k^
12I feel like watching 2 girls one cup
12bhkdjmklsbjgkdkgjfhkjn
I can't love nor tolerate
So, let us discuss episode 7 of the MLP:FiM franchise.
Fads
EW NO
No, not you HML, bronies love and tolerate everyone else.
it doesnt deserve to be called a franchise
Why not? Too afraid?
The Gilda episode was better
That one featured Gilda getting pranked
Gilda... It could've gone better.
With COMBUSTIBLE LEMONS
Who is gilda
Sounds like Hilda
MLP is a dumb cartoon
Gilda is griffon.
/me shot
Nothing that you'd know.
HEAVE
That fraking gryphon
12Some say i go to far, I say I don't go far enough.
12I liked Winter Wrap Up the most

ive not watched one ep of it
Lol at people who knock things they haven't tried.
That smile
Wow, that pony needs a better design
3Did somebody say... Hating on ponies?
ME!
Like, the teeth are ALL out of place and in a line
Lazy design
I DID
I DID
It's meant to be a really cheesy smile. :P
3Dude, it's comedic effect.
6AWESOME.
12Someone is about to be ponyed
Ponies arent funny, and i know im not either
It's exaggeration, and cartoons aren't usually known for realism.
...
/me is unaffected
12*awesometrollface*
What happened to love and tolerance?
^
OH, Hilda is the BW character girl
I AM. NOT! A PONY HATER! </wheatley>
Oh, and if it's a comedic effect
why arent we laughing
Then...it's not doing its job well
:|
;p
3Love and tolerance is not good to make people believe
Something my sick friends introduced me to.
i am not make believe
im 100% real

LOL, it's a still image.

No thanks, I'ma forget that link
If you want to see the effect, watch the episode.
Oh
Lemonade stuff
/me gets Angry at life and gives the lemons back
We don't need your lemons
Lawl, I'll shovel all the crap they've made me watch onto you then.
Fail much?
fail
Mega Fail
3It was just a test
/me laughs
They're too busy thinking about ponies
...hahahahahahahahahaha
;o
12Bring it
3And ponies are bad why?
Hey.
04I reached a fatal problem x-x
because they are annoying creatures
Yes...?
04Is there a way I can on-the-fly move a registration point?
3Explain why, please?
6I'ma play TS2..I shall bbl. ^^
i just did
04Like, it's at the top-left corner but I need it to be at the bottom
they are annoying
Darkdragon: Most probably because people post them everywhere, and go on about them too much.
There's a pony farm in the bowels of Aperture Science
Overexposure to something you don't like IS annoying.
04lol
12lololol sonic fanbase
Registration point isn't important though, why?
^
04so um, there any way I can remidy this?
04yes it is actually
3We don't post them in places other then the pony club, and the Last poster wins, and you can just not look at those if you wish
04see, it's what controls the X-axis
04erm
12But really, you pony hater take this too seriously12 o-o
04no, the X and Y axis
It's just... ponies!
12haters*
04so let's say I make it that the symbol is swapped with another symbol
Well you guys see
04it'll swap it in relation to the registration point
3Yes?
This is a GENERAL chat...
04So I could have Spinarak floating in the air
And if it's a general chat...there shouldn't really be a whole pile of pony stuff :p
04When I need it to be on the ground
But oh well
04Get what I mean, dari?
3Okay, we could do something else. (Such as code spam~)
No.
You could move the mc inside the mc dynamically.
take Spamming to #ircgames
It doesn't matter, thought if you show me the problem it'll be easier for me to explain how to fix it.
3Dude, it was a joke.
:P
...
12Hmm, most of us bronys also like 5th gen, so lets talk about 5th gen!
02.-.
RESHIRAM!
3okay.
That is all.
3ZEKROM
but im being serious, if you want to spam take it to IRCgames
3Is better
Anything other than 1st gen pokemon, ew.
Even though I dislike 5th gen, I perfer it over MLP x.x
Fact
Oh guys
3Hey, you said that we wouldn't talk of ponies
hm, actually
PM then :P
3and yet you bring it up anyway
12Na, a PM would not be fun. We want to turn more people into bronys.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7PGKcikaGY&feature=channel_video_title
3Yup
02That won't happen if you annoy us with constant talking of it.
02Just like when we talk about MHT and HML gets mad
;o
MHT?
Monster hunter Tri
XD
No idea what that is.
lmao
3It's an awesome game
3You should play a demo or something
Darkdragon should just create their own channel XD
I could help you if you want
Who needs help making a channel? O_o
3So, how's everyone's day going?
12Good :3
12Did not have to do much today
3I'm a bit sleepy, but I've been fine today~
12bbl
Movie clip.
04sorry, I'm not-
04oh
04yeah um, that's an idea but it's risky
04because then I have to line up the motion path to what it was originally...
04well I guess I can just use rulers
04I'll try that quickly now

Well, I hope they get better, honestly.
That sucks
Nopony seems to know what happened... so that's what's really got me going.
Yeah, I kinda picked a bad time to get iffy in the first place... so, yeah.
Thanks for hearing me out.

Well, in any case. You're by yourself in second place now, and you'll have to wait a week or two to challenge for the crown

Not a problem
Hope your friend gets better

I was extremely confident in my abilities

Oo
Oh.
I see why you're so upset now.
Hence the pic/Life in Black vid on the site now
Yeah... I was wondering why you didn't just change the list to put you in 4th like you would have been...
Well, if I can get up to 42 points in a month or so, so can you!
4Hello
5Hey~
5Nyaaa, where is everyone?

02Nope, High school xD
5Man that's early.
02I know
5I didn't start classes until 7:45 AM.
02;-;
5This fall none of my classes will begin until about 9:30. (Yessssss!!)
02^^
02Anyway, if I don't get to sleep I'll come back. seeya~
lol
5See ya! (: Hope you can get some sleep~
6:00 ain't that early for high school.
I was always ready to leave the house by then
back when I was in xth grade.
Annoying but it's doable. lol
4Hello everyone
\o
I am waiting for laundry.
5It'd be early for me. /night owl
I've turned into a night owl these past few uh
months or years
doesn't feel like years.
so I wanna say months
even though it's been like twenty of them.
5That's like a year and three-quarters. xD
4I'm a night owl too, I fall asleep around 4:00 am
5So you could say months.
this past few relatively short time spans composed of thirty to sixty days.
My usual bedtime is around 2:00
4Whoa
5Okay I'm not like EXTREME night owl like that. During the summer I go to bed around 2 AM and wake up around 9 AM.
yesterday it was 4:30
but that was a freakish occurrence.
5Once I stayed up until 3 AM finishing a paper. Uuugh. D|
Hm, it's 4:43 am over here.
5Never procrastinated again lolol.
Most days I need to do something in the morning though, I'm in bed by like 22:00 the night before.
I'm procrastinating sleep because I have an exam tomorrow. :P
4Procrastination is evil
Well, today.
You know what I mean.
12lame
Procrastination is the enemy of sleep.
And I like sleep.
4^
5During the school year it's to bed around 11:30-midnight and up at 6-6:30 AM.
5But that was high school. xD
lol high school
5I'll probably still go to bed around that same time though~
I used to go to bed by like 20 or 21:00
5Provided whoever my dorm-mate is isn't a loud person... or someone who snores. /facepalm
then I stopped doing that because it was lame
5I wish I could fall asleep that early lol..
I used to be able to control my sleep hours. XD;
5I literally can't go to sleep earlier than 11 PM.
then I stopped doing that because it was lame.
5It's nuts! I hate it! Especially if I have an early morning the next day!
4It takes me like an hour to fall asleep XD
How fast I fall asleep depends on how f#d up my mind is at the time lol
5I have to read or write for at least half an hour or I'll be up all night THINKING oh man.
If I had a normal day, it can take me a while to fall asleep
but if I've been up for say
4._.
eighteen hours straight
working on code
running solely on coffee and 5-hour energy
then I can pass out in maybe thirteen to fifteen seconds.
(not speaking from experience or anything)
5Once I went to bed at 11 PM and was up until 2-3 AM THINKING. Can you believe that? I practically planned a novel while trying to sleep. Of course I forgot it the next morning but ugh, why does inspiration hit when my head hits the pillow. xD
4I doze off when I'm bored, I just kind of fall asleep
because inspiration is what pillows are made of.
5And then sometimes I then want to write down the idea but NOOO, then my eyes get tired and I can't write.
Inspiration cleverly glazed onto a void which drains energy and willpower.
5So then I lay back down.. and bam. Insomnia. Too tired to write, to awake to sleep.
that is why I sleep without a pillow.
5O__o;
:P
5I couldn't do that. I have neck problems.
I have more problems than just my neck lol
my neck can gtfo
sleep comes first.
5...I also have back problems? ^^;
then sleep without a mattress.
problem solved!
4I once woke up with my body half off of my bed, my neck felt horrible
I once woke up stabbing at something off the side of my bed
complete with pocketknife.
It was weird.
4At least it wasn't yourself 0_0
It woulda sucked if I was sleeping with my wife or something.
That woulda been ugly.
o.o
You have a wife?
yes, clearly
4You have a WIFE?
4Whoa, dude
5Why are you guys so shocked?
Beat me to it.
5Arti's engaged.
5It's not that weird to think a member or two (or three or four) could be married.
Well most TST users aren't that old, or old enough to even drink :p
4I'm far from being married
21 lol
It is 18 here and in the UK
:P
She doesn't like being stabbed with pocketknives and such.
4XD
12Gay marrige isn't legal here *sigh*
5I'm 18, I could get married... in Iowa. >__>
im 17 x-x
5Hey, now.
5Let's not pass judgment on entire countries, eh?
^
12Hello Man
okay
At 16 you could hop over to Gretna Green and get married in the UK.
/me 5waves
4Hello, dude
5:|
o:
stop judging countries
12Yes it is, I live here
5Yes, that's extremely mature of you.
Shame, isn't it Icy :<
it has such a high drinking age because people can't handle it.
5Guys, /really?/ Now?
Did I come at a bad time? lol
Yes, because the topic is drinking. lol
4Yeah....
:P
I wanna be able to drink.
:P no you dont
drinking is bad
:P yeah I do
12I drink, and I'm underaged...
5Wow, okay, I'm not getting into this because someone's going to... You know, nevermind. I'll be back.
stop passing judgment on people
Married before you're old enough to drink, lawl.
.,.
stop passing judgment on countries
>:(
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMR4XBFEqLY
:P
4I don't ever want to drink, let's just start a new topic
:P
I have no clue what to say to any of this.
12Getting drunk sucks, why would you want to do it,.
inorite
4Contradicting yourself, much XD
Odd
I am allowed to contradict myself
No You arent
4I'm allowed to divide by zero
Same
:P
4And I'm not afraid to do it
Quite.
12I think...
Hey Icy, are you a guy or gal? </random question> XD
It's 1am, my mind is blank
4Who wants me to divide by 0? XD
12I think I'm both, but that's ok
NO One.
Really :o
o3o
Interesting
I do.
:O
12Nah I'm a guy
Same here XD
again trying to rickroll and failing again
WB
its getting old fast
4And that kids, is what happens when you divide by 0
do what i did and quit doing that
:P
Pro.
lol
The universe rickrolls you
4Chat room hates Rick
Stop passing judgment on Rick.
12Guys....
/me runs
Many people dislike rick, sadly :<
12I am Rick Astley...
4Noooooo
Guys.....
Tell me how you're feeling
I am your father.
:P
12Daddy?
So, kittens and frogs. Awesome or awesome?
4LUKE SKYWALKER
Icy, he is a liar :<
Be careful
4Frogs and Kittens = win
12I speak only truth
There is a frog on my porch right now and it is being awesome.
03fucking shit
Kittens are so BA.
4Lucky!
You should lick it.
I should.
12*licks it*
4You should kiss it
Give you super powers.
Maybe :P
4*chirp*
WB Aurora
4Lotsa name changes
WB Aurora
Tons of WBs now
:3
WBWBWBWBWBWBWWBBWBWBBWBWBBWB
we should only WB people we know XD
and no that doesnt count baadfood
:P
4WB Entertainment
;P
oh NOW you guys return
lol
4First thing that came to mind
We should all get naked.
o.o
manly
Not here, please
XD
not in front of the kittens
:(
Kittens are naked, too.
They have fur
being naked in the presence of other naked things
Which covers them up XD
is just weird.
12Intresting...
Hmmm, good point.
Maybe just one of us should get naked, in that case.
4OH U
And get rid of the kittens.
That will work.
I vote not me.
:D
o_O
4The fact of getting naked in front of people is creepy
ok, can we please move on to a topic that is appropriate
please?
It's only creepy if more than one person does it.
4Birds
4KITTENS
are naked
BIRDS EVERYWHERE.
4BURDSSS
Birds have a cosmopolitan distribution.
4Lol
I found out just the other day what cosmopolitan means.
Kittens kill birds
Now everyone is off to google it.
4Except me
4I'm too scared
*achievement unlocked*
lmao
4Ponies
cosmopolitan is obviously an innuendo.
4Do not mention them ever
Sleep
see what I did there.
4Nay
No we didnt see, and we didnt care :P
I cared.
Therefore your statement is false.
the above statement is true.
4The below statement is false
Hi.

06By not quickscoping? Using any of the other guns in the game gives them a headache and makes them very mad even
06I dunno why
Nah.
!espeon
If they're any good they'd still kill you.
actually don't forget United offensive the EXP pack for COD1
best multiplayer COD I ever played
then kicked for Tea-Bagging and botting
06Well 9/10 quickscopers are the ones trying to imitate the good ones :P
and YESH COD:UO, best CoD in the whole libary of them :3
I wouldn't say so, most of my friends and their friends were pretty good.
go old skool
so you actually admit one COD was good lu? :3
*runs*
Unreal Tournament made frigging Deathmatch
PLAYABLE
Hm, I've never played battlefield.
yes Nick, the first one was good, the second CoD was playable, the rest is crap
worst ideas for MP online ever: GTA 4 and SR2
^
Best games I've played in a while are RDR and GT5.
don't forget the rest of GTA
god I hated SR2 online.
Black Ops was meh.
black sheep of the fammily ;3
best games for me were proberly older ones
do you ever played that friend who got the powerful gun and just camped there protecting it to prevent anyone else from getting it?
06well dari I don't blame those who know how to do the whole quickscoping stuff staying with other people who know how to do it LOL. Point it, bad quickscopers = free kills
06End of
/me flops
thats what SR2 MP was about, someone guarding the only entrance up a building to a rocket launcher, using, a rocket launcher
anyone who came up was guaranteed to die
Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Diablo 2, Doom, and for newer ones, go Starcraft 2 and Anno 1404
Hahaha, well the only way to get good at them is practice, so there are bound to be bad people trying.
^
don't forget those DAmn trolls who keep challenginf you on MP, god i hate them
06Of course but I'm mostly talking about the stereotypical
06"montage kiddies"
"montage kitties"
better
/me runs
Some of the MW2 hacks are awesome, there are some really good zombie mods.
Yes
We know ;p
06But then again, I'd rather go against even good quickscopers than someone doing some other "creative" trick. Like one man army / danger close
Zombies, oh lawdy
ZOMBIES!
GET OUT THA SHOTGUNZ!
06And lol yeah, mods
06:3
some mods i played screwed up my games
badly
like some for C&C Generals:Zero Hour
LOL, most fun you can have on CoD is go camp on rust with 1man army/danger close and a noob tube, then get a nuke and listen to the people on the other team afterwards.
They got so annoyed.
On MW2 I mean.
i know right?
xD
06See, that's what I'm talking about
12Espeon~
yeah MW2 nukes >.> what were IW thinking?
06HEY GUYS LETS REWARD PEOPLE FOR CAMPING SPAWN IN OBJECTIVE GAMES AND LET THEM WIN THE GAME
06GENIUS
anyways you people wanna know a great MP game? World in Conflict
hi
thoroughly, thoroughly brilliant, shame there was so little interest in the game :|
good MP and Sp would be Company of Heroe
*Heros
*Heroes
o.o
omg yes
i just got the trilogy complete :P
COH brilliant, although I was never good at the base building RTS MP games
it really like the option to actually play as the Nazi's
which is why WiC was better for me
I'm just remembering star wars battlefront from PS2, that game was epic.
everyone want the BEST FPS EVER?
Doom
Lawl
Always with doom.
they did it right the first time
yes
06battlefront
Goldeneye
06was tons of fun
when people brag about bad graphics i'll yell at them
and MOH: Allied Assault
IF DOOM WASN'T MADE< YOUR SILLY CoD WAS A FFING SIDESCROLLER!
and COD 1 *runs from flamethrowing )
Why do people rave about Goldeneye?
TRY SNIPING THAT!
xD
actually wasn't wolfenstein before doom?
06lol, sidescroller
06gang garrison up in this
yes Wolf3D was before doom
also from ID Games
also Goldeneye was great because it was a movie tie in that is actually considered one of the greatest games of all time
but DOOM brake the cycle better, and did it right
no other movie tie in can say that
i never played golden eye, but i really want to try it
Isn't goldeneye getting a remake?
its already out dari
Oh.
Does it not live up to the original then? I haven't heard anything about the remake other than that it was being made sometime.
/me stops ranting now
Goodnight all
Cya.
06I'll be back in a while

Heya Aero
hi guys ^^
03sigh
03I don't know if my RAID array is being slow or what
3Hard Drives: [C:Windows] 129.41/1863.01 GB [F:] 209.98/1863.01 GB [G:] 205.39/1863.01 GB [W:] 291.07/1863.01 GB [Y:TV Recordings] 7377.22/7451.93 GB
03see that drive Y LOL
.v.
03but files are going like
032MB/sec
03to it
03that's really really slow
Slow
03I know right
And wait
03at this rate it'll take s3everal years to transfer 2TB
One drive
Or RAID :P
03RAID.
SLOW RAID wat
03that's why I just said RAID array
03well
03I don't know
03it still says "initializing"
03whatever that means
03o.o
I think each drive needs its own love
Or in other words, the RAID controller is having a hard time
Maybe it was too cheap
:o
03dude
03it's a $200 motherboard
03with the RAId built in
03I got a new CPU too
Oh lawdy
033.24 GHz :P
Geez
0324GB RAM
Overkill
Yeah
I'll be using that much
In...10 years?
So is DRF going to waste time bragging about money spent on his PC which could of been spent on LL?"
/me flees
03LOL
03dude
03I tried to spend money on her
03she won't let me
03she's all
03You've spent enough on me, I feel guilty
I have?
03I'm like, good, then help me get achievements and we'll be even
/me runs
/me shot
:P
Which socket is your Core i7?
031366
03see
03basically here's what happened
03my older one was 1156
Bah, never getting that :P
Can I have it?
03and I was trying to find a good motherboard
:o
03since the MSI I had only had one PCI express x16 slot
03well, it's really really really hard to find good 1156 motherboards, since that socket has been discontinued
03it ended up being cheaper to just get a new processor LOL
03I'm not even kidding
03it was only like $160
03for this
03(the CPU)
Wow
03my older i7 was $100 more
03yeah
03the motherboard was another $150 or so
Crazy deflation
:P
03but good 1156 motherboards were well over $300
03so it works out XD
03and as for you having it... it would cost me a fortune to send it to bermuda
I know, and I have a Mini-tower
So I don't even know what Mobo would fit XD
03my motherboard is full ATX
I haven't checked the specs in ages
03wtf
03this new i7 has the same Windows performace score as my old i7
03despite it being almost .5GHz faster
Hmm :P
03that was 2.8, this is 3.24
03inb4 overclock
Nah
03oh, I'm using liquid cooling now.
I'm using fans
Forever fan
:D
03I was
03but
03the fans are fricking heavy
03and get all dusty
03and my friend found me this decent liquid cooler that you don't have to worry about
03it comes pre-setup
03you just screw it in place and you're done
03:D
For the stuff I do on my PC, I could run it without a fan ;p
Since I'm living off of my laptop now LOL
See, my PC is just for storage
Now I might buy myself a wireless N router
Heya Credit
And hmm, the Core i7 860 turbo is the same as the i7-960 O.o
Yet that half GHZ difference
03wait
03what
03my CPU was not turbo
Hello HML
I know, but the Intel site XD
Odd thing
03heh
03well
03the main difference with the 960 is it's triple channekl
03-k
03but 24GB of RAM ;o
IKR?
3GB forever :>
Hilariously, a friend of mine has been given a chance at owning a hilarious, and pretty awesome computer.
What is it like? LO
3RAM: Used: 1239/1908MB
;D
...IBM Z/System mainframe.
It's about three years old. :P
Room sized :o
:P
4 cabinets actually.
And... I believe about 128G of RAM. :P
Can it run Crysis?
Needs Windows 7 Ultimate/server
:P
Install z/VM, and stick a few Winderp clients in.
And yes.
It can run Crysis.
About 32 at the same time. :P
Fun :p
Does it cost a billion dollars?
It also has I think about 100T of disk. :P
(Mmm... DASD.)
(What)
DRF
03LOL
03100TB?
He needs that PC
YES
100T O>>o
TB
100T as in 100 TB.
Whoa
And again, look at the RAM.
128GB
The system cost I believe 10 mil.
/me returns.
Every PC feels sad now
WB Espeon
10Wb Xeli
06And now I wonder how he has gotten the chance to own something like that
They're scrapping it for a bunch of Winderp clusters.
Good
(Congratulations <company> you're full of dumb.)
06Lol
At least there can be more USE put to them :D
...You know the z/10 can run Windows ontop of a goodly hypervisor.
And you'll actually have uptime that's longer then an hour. :P
/me runs
My longest uptime was around 5 days lol
3Uptime: 3 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds
drf: Do you have space for two full height 19" racks? ...And a massive HVAC system. ...And three phase power? :P
/me hides
Linux is blegh.
I prefer BSD. :P
Same difference
Which is less "Apply head to wall."
/me hides
Have fun with hospitals and head dents
BBS
drf: The racks are FULL of hard drives.
03XD
03nice
And not nice SATA.
03but only 19"? I could make it fit
03what is it then, SCSI?
Either FICON or ESCON.
03o.o
03never heard of it
Welcome to the world of mainframe technology.
Or "I have more storage then I will EVER BLEEPING NEED." :P
03i just want massive storage XD
03dude no way
03I could fill up 100TB
With what?
03I record so many TV shows that it's insane
03TV recordings/
03HDTV is huge
03like 10GB a movie
That which makes up 90% of the internet?
(Starts with a p, ends with an n. Is four letters. :P )
03XD
03maaaybe
"So, what does <company> do with their 100T of storage?" "Well, about 75% is various databases, mostly accounting and project files. Another 10% is the user files. The last 5% is various system critical components." "You left out 10%!" "Oh yeah... that's full of... we'll call it 'data.'"
03XD
o3o
;o
"Graphics and Mechanics are 50% at least for the game to be good and another 50% for gameplay,story line and characters. People who say GFX and Mechs are not important should STFU and play their 20 years old nes games because they're not true gamers,they're retards in the gaming community"
wow that comment on IGN made me laugh so hard
Lol, tards
Well they just don't know quality
Or real toughness
basically it sounds like he's saying video games are all about the graphics, story and characters make good video games nowadays, not actual playable games
So if I have this amazing cube which loooks sooo realistic and doesn't move, it is a good game?
Wow
so I guess because I have my NES and been playing that more means I'm a retard, because the video games I played back then aren't significant to video games as a whole today
and HML so true
Yes, because Immobile cube > Mario Bros
And if it has OMG 3D, the more brownie points
whats the name of that dancing game again that came out on WII's launch
Just Dance?
yes
10My little sister loves that game </random>
LAWL THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN ZELDA II OR STARFOX COS YOU KNOW IT HAS BETTER GRAPHICS AND MOTION CONTROLLS

06moiotn cnortls > gaempaly guys, it's obvious
/me rolls
lol espy xD
also another comment someone made about all the small house devs being bought out by big companies, so true really.
The video game crash came about there being too much competition and products for sale beign released by too many companies making too many bad games
now its too little companies releasing too many games that are the same
like Transformers War for Cybertron was great, but it really was a GoW clone totally
/me 5waves to people~
10Hi RP4L :3
another crash could happen on the basis there is now too much products based so similar to each other being released by the same companies

that it has to be quick to load
looks good
not too hard on my server load
Well, IPB is pretty big by itself
that page you viewed in total including images is around 50 KB's
not IPB 3.2

:D
at the moment JR uses around 100 mb memory, (RAM on the server at the minute) The new JR is around 10 mbs
Damn
I got to do a bit more work but yeah after this, JR will be even more popular
:P
cause, its always online, will be fast to load, easy to use
and have some great competitions and content
:D
:D
btw JR is starting to sell hosting, only small though 25 - 30 clients
just to pay for the servers and competitions :D

04well the thing is
04it uses external files for music
04so :/
7Remove it when you send it there? :P
04I need to find a server so I can upload files to there..
04yeah that makes it look crappy
Pretty sure you can store the music files inside the fla.
So they're in the SWF when you publish it.
04yes but as I recall that makes it lag like all hell
04And if it doesn't lag it sounds like crap.
Surely lag time from loading it externally would be worse?
Hi.
04What's a good compression format for audio that isn't slow but at the same time isn't crappy?
04um
.ogg?
;o
04you do know the external file loading is instantanious |D
04hm
04good idea
7MIDI. :3
When the file is local.
04lemme try that
/me 7flees.
04rofl
04yeah I know
/me starts making OOGs
Not if it's loaded over the internet, which was more what I meant.
MIDI FTW

04hm
04What compression should I use?
04MP3 makes it slow
04no I don't
;o
Silly OGG :P
What bitrates are there
/me 7finished another fakemon description.
04talking to Dari -.o

04um
Hmm.
04"ADPCM, MP3, Raw, speach"
04*Speech
;p
048bit, 16bit, 32bit, etx
04*etc
To be honest I don't know that much about music file types/compressions.
16 is decent
/me shot
04and apparently there's a 8kHz sample rate
Ns look at other chans.
SNEAS
That is...kinda terrible
04Should I do that?
04k
04:P
04erm
04that's an option for rate
/me 4is listening to the Okami soundtrack while people chat
I'd start with a lower quality version, then keep trying higher quality each time until you get a level of compromise.
Between lag and quality.
04ugh
04yeah I know
04but
04eww
Start with 64KBPS, then go to 96 :P
0416bit converts to mono
04:c
Ew x.x
4*chirp*
04Flash CS5?
There normally is a option for Stereo and your bits o.o
Odd, and I don't have Flash CS5 to add to this confusion :P
I don't know why it would lag though, most flash games have music embedded and they don't lag.
Maybe they use MIDIs :P
But yeah, I shouldn't worry about lag
Unless you have a terrible PC, or slow internet
02aka: me
4And me
Slow internet wouldn't matter if the music is embedded.
Hmm, seems the .ogg at 64KBPS is just a bit smaller than the MP3 @ 64 for a 2min song
But the MP3 is slightly louder
So odd
Yeah, OGG is better sounding
The drums are clearer XD
sup people
who was the one I had to teach how to stream?
DCD couldn't show up due to college
04still sounds horrible
04k so
04gonna make them OOGs
04...Soundbooth doesn't convert to OOG.
And you can't import?
Or export, however you got the music into there
hello
04waitasec ideas
What idea?
o.o
/me shuts off Alan Wake until morning .-.
04I'm going to start at 112 kHz
04and go down until I hit crap
04and use the one before that |D
04btw
04An embedded sound that is.
Yeah.
04tell please c:
4I'm rather confused atm
04you don't need to know what goes on here
04|d
04*|D
/me waits for the great Prince's answer
/me shot
Well you put the sound file in your library, then change its properties, checking "Export for AS at frame 1", and give it a name to use for AS.
04ah
04nice
sup
Then you'd load it with AS like this.
so, who're the ones who wanted to learn how to STREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM?
04k
whatever.play();
04so
i would like to learn how to streem
4I'm guessing it is about someone here who has Flash trouble *hides*
04var BGM:music = new music(); || BGM.play(); ?
Then yeah, you place BGM.play(); where you want it to start.
You can tell it whether to loop (I think) or not and how far into the sound to play as well, and stuff like that.
04o_O
04so
04can I tell it WHEN to loop?
04Like, when it hits the end loop at *insert time*?
Hmm, I don't think that's a built in function of the class, but you could write an extension of it, or find some other way to do it.
04or something
04|D
04Looping music is the least of my worries right now
Lol, you don't even need to change the sound type outside of flash.
You can do it inside.
04k
In properties, you can change the compression, default, ADPCM, MP3, raw, speech, and change the quality/bit rate.
04yes I know
Oh, and in regards to your question about looping, if you know the point you want it to loop at you can just use an if statement in an enter frame function.

how many more worthless attacks do you have
like they're not bad but everyone is so crazy about them I don't get it!
not many left i presume
Over 9000
nup
Yeah, I know what you mean
every
song
sounds
the same
nup
the same goes for any powerpop band like all time low or the maine, every song is the exact same one and you can't tell a difference until you hear a chorus for the second time in a song
and you're only proving that im actually getting to you by continuing these attacks
:P
once again, it's not that they're bad, it's just that it's so repetitive and overrated
12Or you might become a brony
Yeah, I've definitely noticed that with All Time Low
4i watched it
I never found them all that great
Nup
4IT'S PRETTYFUL
Ew

the only way that they're so popular is because they write cheesy songs about a guy being at a girl's every beck and call and/or because the guys in it R TTLY HAWT TEEHEEHEE SMILEY FAYCE(:

03they arrested this 11 year old kid for breaking a window, then caught him with lighters and a cigarette
03and his mom said he's smoked before, and might have gotten marijuana from his 12 year old brother
03wtf is wrong with some parents
What the heck
But drf
Those kind of news, depressing as they are, are seen this before things for me
03well it's one thing if kids do stuff and their parents don't know
03then it's just kids being stupid
I have heard of such things in Singapore, though not as serious
03but if the mom has caught him before...
Yeah
some parents just stop caring
It's sad
/me faceclaws
it is
but every first-world society have such tales
and some
never care
I have watched a drama on such wayward kids whose stories are based on actual cases

can't think of a method to use for the !pokemon script system
?
in relations to the new !setgen script
!setgen5
Syntax: !setgen5 [on|off|status] [nick] (Only moderators can turn gen5 on for nicks other than their own, normal users, or mods who wish to use it for their own nick, just use !setgen5 [on|off|status].)
it uses readini/writeini to write to a file under a nick's name
like, gen5=on, gen4=off, etc.
and all the pokemon are separated into different files depending on their generation
five .txt files, poke1 poke2 etc, pick random valid number and read [ poke $+ %pokenum $+ .txt ]
?
as in, pokemongen5.txt
Ah
my brain is fuzzling atm
how do I get it to choose a number from the ones that are valid though?
you'd usually use a while statement, letme check what comparisons can be used
ah right
I doubt $rand would work
You need to plug in limits
hmm, there might be something but it's gonna require something odd
wouldn't be too difficult if $rand could be used with binary, doubt that's possible though
don't think so
but that's a very long system
and it's icky
would be awkward too
yeah
and let's avoid a goto ...
noooooooooo
not gotos ;x
don't want raptors attacking the bot's host machine
:x
aaaah wait
if you can convert the list of allowed gens to their numbers
then I'll need to test how while (v1 & v2) works but I think it can be done
huh?
how to explain
er
:x
have five variables, and if the gen that variable represents is disabled, set it to zero
hmm, will that work ...
this is damn difficult to figure out
hey
whats up?
I say do that, yes.
and if the gen is enabled, set it to the number of the gen
Ah
a shame $or only allows 2 chars
parameters*
nothing much
Try something else?
a pity, yes
I could possibly rescript the system
if I can think of a better one
or I could do the long, boring and tedious way
and write up over 9000 if/elseifs
for every single combination
that would take a long time
yes it would
and slight correction, just have the variables equal to 1 if they're on, not equal to the gen
will work better this way, I think
(I'm still working on a method)
true
yeah I'm trying to think of one as well ;x
I miiight be close but this is weird and needs a lot of testing
Hm, does isnum allow several parameters?
I only ever use if ($2 isnum) { or something
hmm, I'm not sure, I don't think it'll work though
Hm
this next bit is getting weird, store a temporary variable that is $calc( 2^1 ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 ( %gen5 ) ) ( obv fill in the ... with the other gens )
er,
I was wondering whether $calc could work ;x
$calc( 2^1 * ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 * ( %gen5 ) ) <-- remember to multiply
But I'm not too sure of any calculations
Ah
Ah
Well, the easiest and probably simplest way would be using goto
but goto is ;x
hm
and that -should- do it, weird as it is
04back
else it'll get stuck on a particular gen
04o-o
hm true
and yes, I know this is weird, but the & is the most useful statement here and all that's needed to get it into a form that it can be used for
heh, my brain hurts already
well actually, you could use lots of $biton and $bitoff statements, but I think that'd be even longer
I've never used those
:p be glad you didn't have to think the system up
and yeah, they don't look that useful
XD
I'm just like "wat"
also, set -uNUMBER is pretty damn useful
yep
and let's give an explanation, first statement gets us a number that, in binary, if we want 1,3 and 4, will be 011010 (there's an extra zero, sue me for being too lazy to use a -1). 1 2 5 would be 100110, first gens at the end of the list
...yeah, I suck at binary
heh
*if
hm
if they do match, the while's comparison = 0, and it then breaks out of the while loop
if not, back in for a new number
not exactly simple, but I blame mIRC for forcing either the long way, or the complicated way
mIRC isn't very flexible
nope, not at all
in python, I could create a list of allowed gens from a set of variables in two lines, and pick a number from that list with only one more
well, from a set of variables stored in a file, at least
but in python I'd probably already be doing it with a list, so I wouldn't need to create it
Actually, I think I might know a simpler system...to basically get mIRC to /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3 with blah being the numbers, then for it to do $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere)))
hmm
and then to select the character
is there a way to pick out the character like that?
I think so
never tried that sort of thing in mIRC
I remember there was one $ thing
/me checks
hm
ah, $mid might work
(despite not looking like one that would do this)
though
how do you stop them from being included if they're not part?
(The numbers)
I'm pretty sure there is a way
I just can't remember it
because I've used it before
still have that script you used it in?
probably, but I'm not sure where I would have put it
and $mid would probably work
$mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1)
yes, that should work, if you can make the list properly
list?
%var
the string
or whatever, of the allowed gens
wb
that's easy
-> /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3
at least I think that works
if not then use an alias to handle it
and what string would that produce if it was say, 1,3,4 allowed?
well it's be 134
and then $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere))) would turn out $rand(1,3)
and then $mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1) would turn out as $mid(134,number,1)
but then you need a method of skipping the disallowed gens, which I would assume are set to zero
without that skipping you'd have 10340
well
Hmmm
while ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ $2) == on) && (%gennumber < 5) { set %gen [ $+ [ $2 ] ] [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $2 }
What the heck is OneNote
onenote is pretty cool
basically it's a free-writing word thing
Hmmm.
you can type anywhere on it
without needing to hit enter etc.
er
shouldn't*
that's an ... unusual script.
xD
hmmm
just trying to decrypt it
oh wait
I think it'd be
while (%gennumber < 5) { if ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ $2) == on) { set %gen etc. stuff $2 | inc %gennumber } else { inc %gennumber } }
that sounds just about right ;x
hm
oh man, mIRC always makes things more complicated than they should be >:
I think while %gennum =< 5, but other than that ...
what's the context of this while statement, where are you using it? ( like what on *: statement triggered it?)
I'm mainly trying to identify what $2 will be
er sec
I'll paste you the script
alright
ignore the !pokemon script
just look at the !setgen5 one
er
!setgen*
it's quite messy
lmfao we've been at this for an hour
I'm really not sure but I can't help but think $2 should be %gennumber in that script
or that part of it
well, wouldn't the script be going off !pokemon?
and !pokemon is just !pokemon, not !pokemon gen5 or something
so it'd be doing $readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen1) and cycling through all those
actually
yes :x
:p
yeah you're right, sorry, I thought you meant something else
XD
the $2 was kinda just an example because I was too lazy to think of the real thing ;x
this script is confusing, and I wouldn't fancy being the one to make it from scratch in mIRC
lmfao
trust me, it's not the most confusing I've done
it's more messy than anything though
that's probably why it's confusing
like I said, python, sure, you can do all sorts of fun things with lists to make things like this easy
mIRC? god no.
can't even get a proper list :/
yeah :|
buuut I'll at least try help, if I can figure out what on earth is going on here :p
I remember doing fibonacci numbers in python
I had so much fun with that
and yeah, thanks, I really appreciate your help
and now, joy, the fun part
I'll just read through this script to try understand what's happening
Back.
XD
wb
Thanks.
I think I wrote that script around 11-12 when I did
It could be a lot simpler and less messy but that requires effort
if ($2 isnum) && ($2 <= 5) && ($2 > 0) { <-- I think that might be possible to simplify to if ($2 isnum 1-5) {
not sure and something minor, but looks like it could
It has to be a number to be greater then 0.
So the isnum is kind of pointless.
yeah true
the isnum confirms that it's a number at all
/me changes
thanks
np
it's really the $readini parts that are confusing ;x
Lol.
yeah, that's why I'm taking my time over it
XD
Also doing it by hostname rather than nick is better. :P
effort
$address($nick,2) FTW
but there's vhost issues and such
and dynamic IP and such
yeah
They don't change beyond a point.
eh I'd prefer nicks
it's easier to check and such
would be best to use a system like the chatstats where it watches nick changes and such and stores who is the same, IF you wanted that sort of feature
yeah
but then, some people might want it so that a particular nick of theirs has a different enabled list to another
Meh, hostname is easier than that anyway.
so even aside from the effort, this way is more functional
you have the issue of vhosts and dynamic IPs again
What issue with vhosts?
of course, you can bypass vhosts using /userip
People don't change them that often.
that's true, but dynamic IPs are a pain
and nicks are better for this system anyway
anyway, bbl, I'll see you all in an hour, and thanks for your help
Whatever you say. :P
What do you mean?
mine is just the IP, and is dynamic
there is nothing consistent day-to-dsay
there would be no way to track me
You could write a system to track hostnames/IPs to nicks.
a system which can use hostnames and nicks would be even more complex, by a large margin
and relatively useless for what it gives you
It'd be pretty much the same as the system to track nick changes.
not especially, that's just an on *:NICK trigger that makes a list of what nicks change between each other, and then interpreting the lists later
your method has to juggle two independent types of index of what gens are allowed, and consistently come to the correct consensus between them
people usually switch at some point, and just one switch would get the connection listed
if you'll note though I'm not proposing actually using nick-tracking, I'm just saying it'd be almost as effective, and far easier to script, but still isn't worth the effort
Nick-tracking could be done in only a couple lines though, and to make it work with hostnames all you'd have to do is store them when the nick-change script is used.
that would store hostnames, but the script to make use of stored hostnames would be far longer
Nope.
I could make one just to prove a point.
making one and making one integrated with a script this complex isn't quite the same
I thought the script was pretty much just a $read with a couple of $readinis around it?
That's fairly simple to intergrate with.
if by a couple you mean 26 readinis, 10 writeini, and 8 reads, then sure.
plus all the conditions of selecting and handling those
I still think it wouldn't be that complicated, I'd rewrite the script to make it smaller.
you could, but the goal here is for full, flawless handling
I don't get what you mean by that.
I mean making sure it always functions as wanted
It would though.

An evil idea just wafted into my head
Oh really now?
Remember that bus forum I talked about some time back that had a flame war
?
I'm going to make a clone account therer
-r
No one will know who I really am
And then troll and post nothing but MLP:FiM pictures there
When reacting to their posts
You know, people hate MLP for a reason.
Mainly because people post it everywhere.
So you wouldn't exactly be helping the cause.
the people who are posting it are posting it for a reason, they like it.
in 6 months' time the entire forum will either be upside-down, full of bronies, or upside-down and full of bronies.
I am doing it to troll them
/me hides
you're the exception
the current system won't but it's not intended to, so it works perfectly
It would have a store of all the nick's you've used.
and what if before that I'd never used my bot's nick?
this all being assuming I brought my bot in here so the script did see it
Hmmm?
So you join with a never before used nick, and a different IP?
the nick would have been seen with my old IP
Slightly confused, so you're using a nick that's been used only with a different IP, and you've never changed to that nick from a nick linked to your main nick?
Perfectly good solution there, not used
my bot has the same IP as I do. If I disconnected, and the bot did too (but didn't reconnect), and the IP changed, how would it handle if I didn't use my own nick but did end up using my bot's now-vacant nick?
Well your bot would have different settings to you, it's essentially separate since you've never linked the two by changing to that nick from your main nick or a linked nick.
but your system supposedly tracks host
ergo, it should be able to make the connection
If the host changes, and the nick is unrelated then you have to assume it's a different person, otherwise all people would have one set of settings between them, because there is nothing else to distinguish between.
but the host for both nicks was the same before
So they were both on at the sime time with the same host?
In the presence of the bot.
or possibly different times, your system should handle that
Yeah, that would work.
I'd have an on *:JOIN: which checks the hostname to see if it has ever been used before and which nicks it should be linked with.
It it hasn't been used before it gets logged along with the related nick.
If*
I'll definitely give you that the script isn't as simple as I'd thought, but it's still not that bad.
I'd take that any day over some socket scripts. XD I'm not that great with them on mIRC.
sockets are a pain
12!espeon
/me still belongs to Global for 13 more minutes
the ini would also be complex when you actually think about it. you need to be able to look for either a given host, or a given nick, inis have sections which you go to then take an item from; one of those lookups at least, would need to find and item and then look up at what the section is
which doesn't look to be possible
Each main nick would have 2 sections.
With related nicks stored in one, and related hostnames in the other.
so with that system, how do you take a host of a completely unknown nick, and find a nick that the host is associated with?
I'd just have the sections as the mainnick $+ 1 and mainnick $+ 2 with hostnames in one and nicks in the other.
or even taking a nick that isn't one of the main nicks, gonna go through every nick to find who it's connected to?
That wouldn't be too bad, the list would have to pretty damn big to make any lag.
And you'd only have to do it once for each new nick or hostname.
true, but it would still be awkward to code a recursive system like that to search through
and you'd have to do it every time a nick or host appears, for every nick that isn't one of the main ones
I'd have a store of nicks/hostnames currently on the channel.
And which main nick they're related to.
So you'd only have to do it once.
yes, but you have to do it every join, and do some updating and checking every nick change. (someone might change to a nick in another group, then those groups will need to be joined)
I decided that any nicks that are used more than once just have the default settings with scripts.
Otherwise unregeistered nicks would cause problems.
More than once by unlinked main nicks I mean.
so if it's used again, separate it from both groups?
Yeah, I suppose.
fair enough, though that does then defeat the object of having all nicks used by a given person connected
Otherwise unregistered nicks would destroy the whole system.
and I can't give a precise example but it does feel like it might bug it
Hmmm
Think GLIST and INFO might be fo help
*of
glist only shows your own group according to the description
and the bot knowing what alternate nicks it has won't be much use
Hmmm
nope, not much help
Info doesn't seem to show alternate nicks as well
But what about admins?
Do they have access to this information?
that might be something different, but I'm not sure the bot is an Oper, or that we want it to be
nope, bot is not an oper, and making it an oper is a bad idea
Why?
in case an exploit appears and someone makes use of it before it's removed
It tells you whether a nick is registered or not, which is helpful.
that is helpful, yes
Ah
could make it connect across registered nicks
Still doesn't solve some things though.
$crlf is the most problematic exploit that could appear, and in fact has (though has not yet been taken advantage of)
hrm
!tstposts
I wonder if something might be broken
!pony $ip
!pony $crlf
Hmmm
I doubt it.
maybe dump the database in a different location where the bot has access?
that would be possible, but require more and be extremely risky
a raw dump of the database, certainly, is a terrible idea
hmmm
As long as the passwords are stripped before dumping, I see not much risk
oh?
I don't know if it'd be of any help, it says it can though.
Just wondering what happens with vhosts though.
only problem I see here is it's not seeing my bot
hmmm
when I tell my bot to identify, it's added to the list, but that implies it only lists online and registered nicks
which is somewhat less than we want
Lung inspection, wish me luck X.x
Good luck.
;o
Why :<
I don't think it works unless you are looking up your own hostname/IP anyway.
oo D:
unless you smoke a lung inspection should come out fine
aaand there's another problem then
amazingly useful, yes.
Status does work with other nicks though. O_o
status is just telling you online/unreg'd/reg'd though
Hm.
BRB, getting something to drink.
though that still sounds like a bad idea for the bot
!pony $crlf
!pokemon
@pokemon
3@pokemon
your system could handle nick conflicts using status though, I think. if they identify as someone who is definitely the owner of that nick, join it to theirs. If not, they're stealing or unregistered, so ignore them

If you're a non-oper/services oper, it'll only show your nicks that match the specified mask
If you're an oper, it lists as many as it can, within the set limit which is specified in the services.conf
and that are online
for non-opers, it certainly seems to
hm
As returned by /ns list *
or hrm, maybe
and, like we've agreed now I think, not really worth the effort
Well, what did you want?
I think the current system works fine, if people are that desperate to disable a gen, they can do it for their common nicknames
Yeah, I wasn't intending to switch to hostnames anyway
It makes things more complicated, and if there's an error with something, I'd have to check their hostmask multiple times to make sure
the system we were discussing was slightly more complex than that and would work fairly nicely ignoring bugs, but would be too complex to be worthwhile
Ah
so yeah, let's just try make what there is at the moment work
yep
/me continues scripting
argh crap
set %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick $+ %gennumber ] ] %gennumber
I don't think that works because vars don't work inside the brackets
hrm
oh wait, nevermind, I think I'm being an idiot
I know I've done something like that before
you put the var after the stuff
so like %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $+ %gennumber
I'm pretty sure that works, unless the [] stuffs it up
if that's the case I can do %pokegen $+ %gennumber $+ . [ $+ [ $nick ] ]
._.
;o
Hmm

this is a bloody complicated script
Don't say the word bloody

rather than totally rewriting
Yeah, it'll just be changing the $2 isnum 1-5 to 1-6, and adding pokemon6.txt
yeah :x
Nah, I was talking to one guy who stayed up 42 hours not even watching ponies, just messing around on ponychan.

13The downside is that I'm in a comfier seat that takes more motivation to get out of, plus I have to take the laptop off my lap in order to get up

I mean Umby as in BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
06Monobrow cat is terrifying cat
4Im like, sooooo mad
4I spent the last hour and a half setting up my gamecube before i realised i was missing a wire
i'm a bree :3
4so i spent the next while setting up my wii in my room and as soon as I finished i realised my sister took the liberty of letting one of her friends borrow MY gamecube game case...
13It shouldn't take that long to set up a gamecube to begin with xD
4I was looking for wires
4and such
4Then i got a phonecall from the place I was trying to get a job with. When i went in for an interview a few months back they said i couldnt have the job because i was too "incompetent" to do the job. They just called me back asking if i still wanted the job.
4>.>
oo
13no workplaces seem to want me |D
I smell a desperate company
13They either say "we've got no places for you" or they get my hopes up and say "we'll contact you"
13and then they never contact me
13>.>
4I told them i would think about it and they said that they would call me back in a week to see if i still wanted it!
4That's never how a job works
4if you say you'll think about it they drop you o_o
sounds like they've run out of options
4I guess there aren't any technical drafters left o_o
06o.o
10loljobs
10I know how you feel, I've applied to several places and not once has anyone called my in for an interview
10me*
13I've only ever had one interview and that's because my mum knew someone at the place I was applying for
10I was talking to one of my IRL friends who is 2 years ahead of me, and he said he'd been searching for a job since freshmen year and it took him 4 years to successfully find one
13eventually they didn't take me on because I lacked experience
13I know I've never had a job before, but I need to start somewhere, don't I? :<
10Yeah, job experience is important
10I need to look for volunteer work
4I've worked at a few places before.
4Im hoping the economy opens up soon. Because i neeeed to get money for college
10Good luck, most countries are suffering economy issues
4And when jobs start opening up, architecture is the first :3 Need buildings before you can start a job

10HML's reaction when I show him E.T: OH NO I HEAR THIS
10EVERY FREAKING DAY IN THE CAR GET IT AWAY ;.;
Lies
:x
10Now I know how to annoy you if I need to
Please don't
:<
13I don't hear E.T. all that often
13The song I am getting sick of hearing is the Lazy Song by Bruno Mars
13I like being lazy, but I am sick to death of hearing that song ALL THE TIME
10Radio overplayed songs, whee
12Hey Skylands
10Hi
!ew Rap songs on radio
05EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW RAP SONGS ON RADIO
03you seriously need to stop changing your name
03rap FTW
EW
drf has bad taste in music
/me flees
03I like just about any type of music except country
03and stuff involving screaming, like metal etc
12I think this is my last name change
03you're going to change your last name to Kanoaki?
/me hides
/me has changed his name
13songs > genres
Agreed AE
13I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3
but Rap does suck in every possible way
/me runs
13I've found that I like at least one song from every kind of genre of music, so xD
10Just wondering
03nah, there are plenty of good rap songms
03go listen to Changes by 2pac
Skylands, you hate everything I like
10California Love > Changes
Non-rap > Rap
;>
03California Love is nice too
Opera Rap > Everything
03but that's mostly Dr. Dre
03D
03*XD
13I don't even have favourite songs, just some songs that I happen to listen to more than others
10HML, wat.
10?
13and I have phases where I overplay one or a few songs to the point where I want to listen to anything BUT that song :B
You read it right lols :p
Rap crap
XD
12Well, it just seems like every new name I get, it brakes someone’s trade mark some how :P (NS, Slash, ect.)
10And a kanonaki is a Greek instrument
10So? I like all other genres too, HML
13change your name to NightCheese
12lol
13I like calling you Cheese :<
/me runs
10Rock/metal and hip-hop are probably my favourite
06That is all
Rock is my favourite
06Or well, I do have some genres I can't stand but hey :P
03EW UK SPELLING
sod it
06EW EWING FOR THE SAKE OF EWING
XD
10Add U to every word
Eveury
10Replace Z's with C's
10and you're in Britain
Actually no replace Z's with S's
Advertise
10Then we can call you N, Kanoaki :P
12lol
Ew Whiners
13isn't the US pretty much the only place that spells their words differently from everywhere else? |D
practise
Not entirely
10I think so
I hate Practise
XD\
Practice..I perfer it
12I think, Canada spells words just like the UK
10They do
10Most parts anyway
but doesnt change Z's to S's
XD
/me rusn
I made up a word
12I like how in the UK they add a U in everyword XD
03anyway
03I need to leave
03and I don't
03that's annoying
03because I want to say colour like how you say color in Spanish
Not everyword XD
03as in, col-ohr
What is annoying
03instead of col-ur
Oh, hah

10That didn't last very long
12Nope
06I like how it seems like you assume that there is no thing between "bronies" and "haters"
/me flops

10Just in case
12Na, that would be a non-brony-hater
13No offence, but brony is a really silly term for fans of the show to use, IMO
12But seriously, what name fits me best?
06No, it would be someone who doesn't care a rats a** about the show? :P
06I highly assume you're not serious by the way, so for once - please don't surprise me because that would be... yeah
13I've said this so many times recently but
13I like the show, but hate the fanbase
13well not hate
13but you know :B

I hax'd it
hahaha
10Overused memes are overused, also.
Ohai Ripted
06I don't care that people are fans. I couldn't care less. The only "violation" I've personally seen them doing is generally assuming that EVERYONE cares about all their thousands of pony images and seem surprised when people really do not care :P
12I think people just like looking at the art the most
/me 
Espeon is right
As always
06And that's not all people btw
~
12Yes
AE, I agree
Worst word, it brings so much pain to my mind
06But some are just really obnoxious as they over-post (not only ponies, this goes for any fandom) stuff that the majority of people do not care about. And when it's met with people honestly not caring then the desperate plan to not seem obnoxious is...
06wait for it...
06LOL TROLD U GUISE XD
06As usual
:o
/me runs
06The same kind of people who never actually discuss things, to them it's just a game to either get the other person "mad" (whenever they ever respond) or "pwn them so they can't even respond" (when they block them for being totally stupid)
06And that's the first good thing in a long time to come from KYM then
/me rolls on AE

4Hi manly
Hey.
Hallo Manly
back again
dog is out all the time x-x
12I want pineapple but Xai won't chop me any and I am too lazy to do it myself :(
I don't know what to say to that. xD
I love pineapples :<
get the birds to do it?
12lol
You should force Xai to chop it up XD
12Thy'll eat it
12ovO; LOL
12tHREATEN HIM WITH A WOODPEADGE
12-caps
Woodpeckers?~
muahaha that reminds me arti
we have (sort of) tame wood pigeons coming for food now :3
along with the two collared doves
13When life gives you pineapples, feed them to Arti
12YES
12Best motto ever :3
And HML :<
/me steals the pineapples from AE and eats them all
Painfully acidic, but so good
btw about the Newcastle meet, are you interested in art galleries?
to anyone here who's going to it?
12I LOVE art galleries
12Where is there one?
12I already plan to go to the anime stores
well thinking of things to do there's the Baltic over the river (easy to walk to as the new bridge is next to it)
12and plan to get lunch
one of the most prolific in the country and I think is assosciated with tate modern in London
anime stores yes, that animez should be open this time
I'm still struggling to think of what to do in Newcastle except shops...
It's possibly worth doing newcastle one day then getting the metro train or bus to gateshead the next? where the toys r us is obviously
12Yes, I was thinking that
12Though
12Nick..
12There is a bowling alley near Newcastle center right?
not that I know of...at least I don't know where exactly
there is the one at the MC in the Namco place
12ovO
12I want us to go there while we're in newcastle though
ok but I have no clue where it is and what company it is
4Gah I wish i could go to the meet
12I think RN knows
4hopefully next year when im 18
12:3
ooh RN?
XD
Rocket Ninetails
:P
ah
:P
I get confused with RN as Radio Nintendo o3o
/me flees
13a TST meet should totally be arranged in Scarborough sometime
13we have a beach ;3
/me 13is shot
I'd listen to Radio Nintendo (listens to contra boss defeat theme along with 8-bit TZZZTZTZTZTZZ explosion sound)
12and bumper cars
actually I'd love to go back to scarborough
12Me and Xai can get to Scarborough way easier than Newcastle
13I feel bad how everyone I talk to seems to love Scarborough, but I just think of it as a boring normal place since I've lived here my whole life |D
12LOL
that happens to everyone though, regardless of place and whether it's deserved
12You should live around here, you'll run home as soon as you turn a few corners from my house. Infested with a group of vile human beings *shudder*
12I find that after I leave somewhere.. it becomes the most important place in the world to me ><
12EW MANCHESTER
12LOL exactly
12:3
12It has it's uses I guess ;>
4im gunna go for now
13Manchester
4il be back later
12The only uses of good shops for manga and sometimes merchandise
4bye everyone
13is filled with animeshops
13;w;
bii
lol
12Seeya..
bai
12too bad you couldn't see afflecks ;__;
yay, exactly where I'm going in a few months with any luck
12Newcastle has some too
Silly a button
12Lati are you still coming to the meet..? D:
12I can try and see what I'm doing/If I have enough money but I'm not too sure ^^;
13In scarborough only waterstones sells manga now, and it's literally just 3 tiny rows on a small column or something. and most of it is Naruto/Bleach
12Probably not though D:
13WHSmiths doesn't even sell manga anymore here >:/
btw lati if you do come do you have a Kyogre from HG or Celebi on HG/SS you'd like to trade?
or anyone here that's going to the meet?
12I should have a spare Celebi
:O
13Speaking of which, you stil need to give me a Celebi and Zorua sometime xD
YOU'RE JOKING?!
12I went to the celebi event in Preston a while back and I think I stole 4 of them for myself, only 2 claimed soooo :3
ON HS/SS RIGHT?
12yep!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFFFFF
12SS/D/P/P
12and yes I do Angel LOL
12I need to grab them off my D/P/P
omgomgomg can I PM you what I have for trade? D: I have some good pokemons honest!
really?
12the Celebi's were free for me, so why not be free to people who couldn't make it
12Of course ^_^
sa-weet
that does it I'm gonna PAY for you to come to the meet now xD
4Hai guys
that's great lati I've been after one for SOO long!
hai hooh54
13If Lati goes to the meet, make sure to hug her
12Hey Hooh ^^
13she's so cute and small LOL
4Wow, Arti is on 0_0
12No you

/me 13runs
12SHUSH
lol angel
12and yes I have SS :3
4I have HG D :
dang, I need someone with HG
just to make sure you've beaten red right?
4Yeah
/me 13has HG, not that she has a celebi or anything
12I gtg :(
4Goodbye, Arti!
13Goodnight arti :3
12I'm really tired anyway
12Bye :3
12Night everyone ^v^
oh Hooh you have? Have you done the event after beating Red?
night arti!
also angel that's ok its a kyogre I'm after
12Red > Ash
do you have one caught in HG?
4Yep, HG is all finished
13Do you just need it for the Rayquaza event?
oh awesome, are you in the UK Ho-Oh?
4I can loan you Kyo if you need
and yes Angel
13Because I'm willing to trade Kyogre for Groudon so we can both get the event, so long as I can have the Kyogre back |D
actually I want a kyogre but I have some good pokemon for trade
13I kinda grew attached to Kyogre ever since he ate my shoes LOL
that's the problem angel you need both at the same time to do it :\
o.o
eh?
4Kyogre > Groudon
13LOL
^^^^
4He was my first legend figure
Rayquaza > All
:P
oh ok
4Lol
13I was walking with Kyogre behind me and he got grumpy and started eatnig my shoes
13|D
4Ho-Oh > Everything
o.o the giant whale started eating your shoes?
4Deal with it
wouldn't it like eat all of you?
xD
13Yes LOL, and he wasn't happy when I scolded him
13I dunno why but I found it adorable ;w;
12Lugia wishes he was a ho-oh
but yeah Kyogre is one of my fave legendaries from Gen 3 and I'd like to have him but it has to be the one in HG in order to get Rayquaza to work
/me dies
4At least they're chibi, and not full sized
and aw you scolded him? D:
you meany
4My Ho-Oh hugged me
/me loves trailing his lugia around it always hugs him in SS :3
13Well, it's not very nice to have a giant whale nomming my foot when I'm trynig to walk xD
4I still don't understand how a 12 foot tall bird can hug me, though
with its wings?
/me runs
12how can Wailord even walk
4^
13slides across the ground ;3
but yeah angel if we did meet at a RL TST meet I could have a loan of your kyogre, I have a masterball in reserve still in SS so I'll just use that on Rayquaza, then you can borrow my groudon
whales can slide across ground?
how come they get stranded all the time then?
4I wish I could go to a TST meet D :
13not lubricated enough LOL
4I don't live in England ;~;
4But I may go this summer
06what
06Okay I
06took things out of context
06sorry
12I think Unown stalks me
13When we bought cards LOL
13Unoooown
12Me and Angel got a few packs of Pokémon cards and it just so happened that the last card in a great packet was an Unown
12my packet
12and it was my first shiny
12THIS CAN'T BE DESTINY
/me sulks
13Unown loves you <3
12UNOWN LOOK LIKE ALPHABET SOUP. NOT THE TASTY KIND.
4Am I the only person who would hug a Skarmory?

ah
wth
why is the professor woman telling me how to use the DW again?
Funnel?
4Because she wants you to remember FOREVER
10Funnel cake
Forever and ever
I mostly order breakfast food like a bacon sandwich and pancakes but occasionally I'll order bacon sandwich and fries
oh, we have a place called Beth's here too
woah
and that's what I always get there too
:O
XDD
not the bacon sandwich and fries
but the bacon sandwich and pancake
4And she secretly loves you, and wants to do everything for her love
haha
o___o
How can she even love?
>:D
is it open 24/7 too?
the only video game woman I have my heart set on is Samus Aran!
all night long and everything
hohohoohoho
*runs*
yeah
._______.
10o.o
Sleepy
the only places open that much here are Perkins and Hardees
/me drools
10Ew fantasizing over fictional characters
and Hardees sucks
hahahahah
or the one here does at least
Hey, you're insulting me >:(
/me hides
4Lol
lol how is it 'ew' :\
no, I'm kidding
10It's just weird @ Nick
lots of places downtown are open at least really late, otherwise the only other place I know of is denny's
just cos she's not technically real? xD
ah
4As long as you don't take it to far
+1 to anyone in here besides Xeli and Skylands who can actually insult me
10You deserved it~
I think the McDonald's in town are moving towards being open all night
but they aren't right now
oh yeah fast food places almost everywhere here are 24/7
I deserve to be put down? )':
we had a burger king in town once
OMG NOW SHE@S TELLING ME HOW TO USE THE SHARE SHELF AGAIN
10Kidding sis
not anymore
D:
;p
4XD
No but seriously
but there are like 4 mcdonald's
just one burger king
and I would be happy
SHUT UP YOU SECOND RATE B/W CHARACTER WHO APPEARED FOR TWO MINS AND WAS NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN!
usually on the way home from shows my mom and I will go to this mcdonalds just outside of town and I swear to god they put something in the food there
if anyone in here manages to insult me, +1 to them ;p
yeah, it can be that way sometimes at these ones too
because unlike any other mcdonalds they go "HI WHAT CAN WE /MAKE/ FOR YOU???" and after we eat there everything is funny
10I don't think I've ever insulted you before, have I?
4*thinks of a clever insult*
Don't remember
10Like, the real deal insulting
/me 4runs
it's really weird it's not like that with any other mcdonalds
BUT IT'S AWESOME so
Doubt it
13I'm too nice to insult people and actually mean it |D
fail
Hahaha yeah
LOL
fail
10I like how < censored > gets you kicked
there are two McDonalds in town that are always good
10When I typed out just that
the other one is hit or miss
10No bad words
Well, unless you can propose a method
/me runs

Well actually, I set set up Cube to kick

or well, get Skylands or someone on my network to poke me
the last one too
/me poofs
:D
I'm still super jealous
7Well, if you can put the Audino chirp right as it becomes un-shadowed and the 'fwoosh' when the pokeball is flung, that'd be nice. :P
:P
4So what's going on for tonight? I know Silver wanted to see if we could test the stream
6Hey... everybody.
4SIRSPRINKLES
:P it's super cute, they were basically selling diamond/pearl plushie rejects or something
8well, DCD just told me he's super busy
13I'm off to sleep now
13Goodnight all :3
8he said he might try to do the VAC thing tonight
4Night!
night angel
4alright
8but i just told him whenever he can is fine
6Astray randomly dropped in last night spouting something about how he was supposed to show somepony how to stream...
7Bah, was going to say my good-night to her.
6but there was nopony else here...
8oh yeah
8DCD told me he was gonna drop by to train one of us on streaming
4What was the site to see how you're upload speed is?
6With no instructions as to whom?
4Or fast he goes?
8http://www.speedtest.net/
http://i.imgur.com/CVmef.png
6*decides to test*
XDDD
/me 8has an upload speed of 6.58
brb food
6lol 7.95
8well shit man
4Bah, my upload speed is still 0.36 mbps -_-
8you should be streaming
4It would be interesting to see Sprinkles stream
6I probably could, if I had any idea as to how.
4Doesn't he need a webcam?'
6A webcam? To stream? That would be... bullshit.
6Though I do have mic built in to my comp.
8i dont think u need a webcam
8im not sure why you would
6I don't see why you would...
4As long as Sprinkles doesn't randomly play music or sound over what we're showing
8lol
ohai Altair
4*shrugs*
6I wouldn't... though I'd have to set it up so my desktop ponies don't wander onto it.
8DCD said he isnt going to do that outside of post show anymore
6Thank Celestia.
WOAH! I'm back.
8sprinkles, you could just turn off your ponies for a few hours
6It was funny ONE TIME.
6After that, no.
8hey silver
;o
6I know I could, Hipster.
11Colour
8oh, btw, in case you guys didnt see
8i'll be here on friday, i got out of the football camp
11I saw that. Awesome. :D
!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
11So, what's the news on the streaming?
8well
8sprinkles' internet is fast as hell
6 7.95 mbps upload.
8are you able to stream this friday?
6I could, if I was shown how before hand.
4We need DCD in here then
4!chatstats
This script can only be used once every 5 minutes!
6Also, would mean the stream would go on a LOT longer.
11We just need DCD to show you how to do it then.
8okay, astray or DCD is going to drop by at some point I guess
6Since I'm usually here until 2 in the morning.
4Jesus, Sprinkles is right
4Y U GLITCH
4Sprinkles would be streaming shit ALL THE TIME
7It's not a glitch, you fish.
8imokaywiththis.jpg
4Also, no offense to DCD, but I think it would be nice to have a streamer that didn't show Captain Marvelous and sentai all the time
7But if you're curious:
7Hooh54 had a sticky shift button - wrote 87 lines in CAPS.
8true, true
6I have very little to show...
8i like captain marvelous, but it gets old
4Just show video suggestions then
6I could do that.
4^ Wow
8sprinkles, download some arrested development
12bbl, restart
6I have... xxxHolic. XD
4I'm not a fan of sentai *shrugs* But I can't really say anything because he is the streamer
8im not really a fan of anything that comes from japan
wut
6Also, my comp is a 17", so i have a HUGE screen.
11I'm not a big fan either, mainly because it's either you have to read it or you get shitty dubbing.
8true
8also, the style just feel sweird
11DBZ is the only series that's managed to do a good dub, IMO
6...lol
Hooh54, it's not a glitch, it's scripted that way to prevent the mIRC stats program from glitching
6I love DBZ
4It just felt like less than five minutes that's all
11So we know who our back up streamer will be. Mr. Sprinkles. :)
4Silver, I know of a series
It takes up to 2 minutes for mIRC stats to upload the new stats and if another window is already running it'll screw up
And that was 2 minutes lol
6Whoo!
8well, sprinkles would be our streamer
11Oh?
6I'm internet important!
8DCD can't make it
4Cromarti High School
hell, maybe not even 2 minutes
1 minute and 20 seconds exactly
11I'll look that up.
8the test got moved back to this weekend apparently
4What test?
8DCD's test
6DCD and his tests...
11He's got a test for school.
11That's been jumping around, hence all the changes to streaming we've been discussing.
6Has a test to see if he can take a test about taking tests, and the test is primarily based on other tests.
8lol
11Testception.
8btw, just posted flutewood in a thread on /oat/
11BWOOOOOOOOM!!!!
11Nice.
6I've been posting flutewood a lot lately...
6That and: SPRINKLEBERG
8i fluterolled a mod today
8i was proud
6Nice.
make fun of band name have band of that name retweet it LOL OOPS
11Fluterolled? XD
4Clint Flutewood
8spoilered pic of a flute
4The man with no flute
11Nice.
11Alright, now I want to bring something to everyone's attention.
11We have some official competition.
8go on...
11A stream's been discovered, pointed out by the very person who gave us that critical assesment that Hipster, myself, and Sprinkles replied to.
8is that arcesious?
4You mean the guy that criticized DCD for doing the effects and all the people we have in chat
4right?
11Yes. It's in the MOvie Discussion thread.
8ok
11They're called the Symphonic Ponies movie night group.
8anyway, continue
11Aparently they stream 24/7.
8not really movie night then lol
11er, correction. Every night.
6Where's their stream?
8ok
8got it
4I wouldn't say this is exactly bad unless we start losing viewers
6And everypony will see them as knock-offs anyway.
8ok, found the stream
8i dont think we have anything to worry about
8they have 4 people there
6...XD
6link?
11There is a slight chance we'll be losing viewers. Arcesious herself stated that she would choose which stream she'd prefer to visit.
8it peeves me a little that they copied our exact layout though
8http://symphonicmatrix.org/stream/
4We should raid
4lol
11No, ghosties.
6...I've got a web block on it.
6Which means other ponies will too.
11But notice that there's no stream at the moment, and the fact that they use our old version of chat means they'll run into the same mod problems we've had.
6Their site isn't rated, ours is.
4Silver I was just kidding
8anyway
8it doesnt seem like a huge deal
4It's not, we're more organized than they are
4We're "ahead of the curve" I suppose
8we should keep an eye on it and ask them to not stream on fridays if it gets big though
8plus, i doubt they will be able to keep up an every night movie streaming schedule
6That's got to be taxing.
4Right, that sounds reasonable to me
11I don't like to rain on another's parade, but we kinda are the ones who started the whole general idea for this event.
11OH! I just thought of something.
11Er, not just now, but it's something that Arc's critique got me to think of.
6Hey, just stating this. I could probably do a reshowing on Saturday earlier on for all the Euro bronies.
11....that's fucking genius.
4Dude
11Saturday Morning Movies for the Eurobronies.
4Sprinkles
4You're like our savior bro :3
8that would be awesome
4Or something
6justthatawesome.gif
8we would need mods from europe though
4everyone is gone
11How did we NOT come up with that?
6Yeah.
8unless you and dari can handle it alone
4!Pokemon'
4!Pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 8Sunkern.
11What time would this occur?
10You killed the chat
4Plus, I'm sure there'll be some people that revisits to see the movies again or if they missed it the night before they can see what they missed
lol
8how about saturday afternoon?
:<
SHame
4I tend to bring disaster a lot
6I was thinking 2 PM EST
11Afternoon...that would be a more reasonable time...
4I guess I'm a secret Absol
8that way it will be night for people in europe and we can still have our regular mods
6Which would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
11Hell, both Euro AND Ameribronies can watch then.
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
I've been trying to talk to her on gmail and she hasn't been replying
no
8and people who couldnt come the night before could watch as well
ohai Aurora
4 2 PM sounds fine, what do you guys think?
...in fact I didn't even realize she left
o___o;
8i like it
well her neo's been on for like 2 hours I think she just left her computer on
eh you're trying too hard to be funny lol
04ROARA hi :D
11This sounds like a hell of an idea, not to mention it actually gives me something to do on Saturdays.
4I like it too
Did someone say my name?
4Man
4Dari
yeah, but it doesn't even show her as away on gmail
11Hi, Dari.
Hey.
/me so tired today
6Wow.
8dari, we had an idea
11Sprinkles just gave us our revelation.
04same
04x-x
maybe it's her mother thinking that you evolved into a 60 year old man
I had 4 hours of sleep
as per usual
Ok, let's hear it. :o
wel
like she did with SR
I had 8 hours
but
;D
:P
haha
still tired lol
8sprinkles said he can stream the movies again on saturday afternoon our time
._.
11Saturday Afternoon Movies.
8so it would be night for those in europe
!setgen status
1st Gen: on · 2nd Gen: on · 3rd Gen: on · 4th Gen: on · 5th Gen: off
6So it would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
4Sprinkles pretty much just gave us an awesome idea
11So that the Eurobronies can have a Saturday Movie Night
Oh, that's awesome.
8and people who missed it the night before could watch too
why 5th gen off lol
4Or if they want to see it again
It's per-nick based
I hate 5th gen
6Dari, what timezone are you in?
this is an updated version of the !setgen5 script
4But this is great, this solves one of our biggest issues
I'm GMT.
6It's 11:30?
Basically does all generations now
12:30
took me ages to script :x
6!pokemon
Aurora, you are a 7Snorunt.
6Okay.
6Google lied to me.
4I salute you for epic coding
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 2Dewgong.

6But yeah, 2 PM EST would be 7 PM GMT.
6All is well.
8ok, here is one potential problem
8when do we do the lottery?
8would it be during the friday or saturday stream?
4Hmm
6After the saturday.
11Both.
6It's early enough for both parties.
11We switch it back and forth
4Wait, what?
6I like Silver's idea too.
8you mean alternate weeks?
6Friday one week, Saturday the next.
11One week, we let the Friday bunch choose.
11Yes, Hipster.
11Exactly.
8i would be fine with that
11Then we let the Saturday group choose the next week.
8eliminates any possible bias
11Same results, nopony's left out.
4Oh
11and yeah, no biase.
4So which day are we choosing this week?
6I like this plan. I'm glad to be a part of it.
hey
hi
hi
11which reminds me, if TUrni puts so much as one more parasprite post in our threads, I'll report his flank.
6He put another in?
6I must not have seen.
11I like this plan, ANOTHER! *smashes fist into the screen*
11He made a smartass comment about me doing Random MOvie Trivia.
6Oh. He's really getting to be a pain.
8i actually talked to turnibrony in a different thread, he seemed more chill than usual
4Bah, let him bark
6Yeah, I see the post now.
11I ignored it.
11Guy's a Waste of energy.
8i didnt really take it that way
8it seemed like he was just sad he missed it
11Yeah, it's hard to read meaning behind text.
4We're making good strides and if he still wants to bitch and moan about the integrity of what people like, then he should just leave and never return because then he's just complaining about taste
8he said he probably would have come last week if he hadn't had a party to go to
6...my comp's upload speed apparently got higher.
11Figures.
6By .25 mbps
11awesome.
8and he said he's planning on coming this week and likes our movie selection
11Sweet.
11Oh, and I get to use this week's movie as an opportunity to get some Jaffar pics. :D
6lawl
8nice
8also
8one thing we need to keep an eye out for
11hmm?
8with aladdin, there are probably going to be some racist remarks in chat, so we need to stay on top of those
!pokemon
6>probably
Kosoveon, you are a 14Illumise.
4Aladdin?
4Really?
6I believe you mean definately.
8i like to not assume the worst
4!pokemon
8but i say 1 warning then ban, depending on the situation
11Considering we're all bronies here, I don't think it's as likely to occur as you think, HIpster.
8if somepony just types "SAND NIGGERS", I will ban them on sight
6I've met some pretty racist bronies, unfortunately.
11But you're right, we *should* keep an eye out for *bad-mannered* racism
4Question
11Asketh.
8yeah, i like to not assume the worst, but it probably will happen at some point
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 3Porygon 2.
She really loves her books.
I've still never read cupcakes
and I don't plan to
4Since we're going to begin re-showing the stream for Euro bronies on Saturdays, will this mean that it's expected for us to return once more to mod?
oh lol I've seen that
8ideally, yes
4I know it may seem like an obvious question, but still
6We'll be looking for more Euro-mods though.
11Idealy, but not required, IMO
4Alright
11What Sprinkles said.
11Alright, now that we got all of that out of the way, I'd like to promote my idea.
8go on...
STEP INTO MY CHOCOLATE EYES
6...
here it is
6I LIKE CHOCOLATE
the V.A.C.
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=5RK4X945
11....
4DCD, glad you're here
I frankly don't have much of a clue as to the details
but
4We have great news
yeah, I won't be able to make i-who's pregnant?
But cupcakes is funny. :<
8lol
4Me
11Rarity Sauce is.
6All of us.
11Again.
congratulations everybody!
4Even you
OH SHIT
8i already emailed DCD general stuff
8about the saturday stream
11oh, is this a Junior incident? (Note, NEVER accept that as a bad movie)
Also mom found my ponies. She didn't exactly take it BAD but now she wants to talk to a psychologist friend of her
6...
8oh boy
Imma just gonna show her the TIME article. When I ain't too busy
6Mom, I am disappoint.
she pretty much gave me a SON I AM DISSAPOINT speech but she was just worried about me being gay I guess
I'm not and I told her, maybe I convinced her, maybe not
8i came dangerously close to saying "everypony" during camp today
6You should show her BMN! XD
My parent's wouldn't care, but they'd make fun of me for at least a month.
6I said everypony in the middle of Hershey Park. REALLY LOUD.
8i hate how people assume that liking stuff thats "girly" automatically makes you gay
8...society, i am disappoint
11My parent's wouldn't give a damn, though my dad's suspicions of my sexual preference would come up again. *rolls eyes*
4Speaking of girly stuff, did you guys see the Rule 63 Spike thread on /oat/ last night?
8nope.avi
in any case
8it probably went up after i went to bed
6My dad doesn't even care. I have Pinkie Pie sailing on his model boat that's on top of the tv. XD
11I was busy in /rp/ again.
8indeed
6:D
4Yes
lemme see if I can ask Astray to train you
cause this week's gonna be hell
8cuz his internet is fast as fuck
and I better get back to work
6YESSIR
11Sprinkles internet is best adept for it
4And Sprinkles is gonna air the stream on Saturdays for the Euro Bronies
6*retests*
that said however, Hipster, you should grab that VAC and have it handy. Just in case
also keep in mind my internet is not very fast either way
1.99 Mbps
O_o
Really?
8oh, and we're talking about doing the selection lottery alternating weeks
speed is not exactly an issue
Wow.
BUT
6LOL 8.97 MBPS
you can't go overboard with quality
8so it would be on friday one week, saturday the next and so forth
because if you do
4Jesus
4 8.97
Are you guys talking DL or UPL?
your viewers are just going to see a freakin' slideshow
oh right
8UPL
8right?
6UPL
my UL is, what
0.96?
in any case
6My DL is 12 MBPS
even if you have a huge UL
4Wow
8.97 upload? Holy hell.
4Sprinkles
using it would basically kill viewership
8yeah
the video feed can become a jumbled mess, plus
slideshow
so yes
6I don't plan on using it like crazy.
4Wait, so are you saying that Sprinkles shouldn't stream?
564 Kbps seems like the best course of action
no no
4!pokemon
11He's saying don't stream at highest quality
Hooh54, you are a 10Alomomola.
I'm saying that you should all get trainin' in the stream sort of things
6High upload would allow me to easily stream while doing other things.
that too
4Alright
yeah
pretty much
which is a great idea
4I'd like to bring something else up at some point tonight
4But we can finish this first
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 12Teddiursa.
bring it up while I get Astray
since I have to go back to work and all
/me yawns
8and make sure to turn off your desktop ponies, sprinkles
10Script spam everywhere
6they're already off
8downloading VAC
6Though, like I said, I can restrict where they walk.
It makes me cru
*Cry
!script !pokemon off
The !pokemon script is now off.
8how do i open this file, DCD?
ohsnap
10Can anybody do offscript?
/me idles
nope
only ops
10k
10I was about to say
or at least +v
er mods
11Do you have an archive progrom, Hipster? Like WinRar?
11program*
derp
!pokemon
This script is disabled! Join #ircgames to use the script or ask a moderator to enable it!
!poekmon
8i have 7Zip, if that's what you mean
6lol my upl speed is getting higher every time I test.
11Good. Right click the zipped file and choose "extract here"
I JUST GOT THE DICE A ROO AV
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Is this the cafe wifi?
8i extracted it already, but i can't open the file
6It is.
:D
What ISP do they have?
11...then I can't help you.
6Umm... Comcast I think.
So high. O_o
Neopets dice games all hate me
Well it's late and I still have work to do.
BBL
6It's either Comcast or AT&T...
11WHat the hell?! I got comcast, and my internet DIES on a daily basis.
6k, see ya Dari.
4Alright dari, see ya
11bye, Dari
8its a .7z file (is that even real?)
8bye dari
6I have to check now...
11Alright, then, to my proposal...
any game of luck hates me
I am having seriously luck with avs lately
omg
7z files ARE real
11Arc's critique mentioned the fact that Chat moves so damn fast, a problem we've noticed as well and just shrugged off. BUT! I came up with a solution. If we make several unofficial rooms, we can have the viewers branch off into each so that they can talk in that place as well as the official chat. Each mod can host a different room.
then again, I'm the type of gambler who cashes out at the same amound I started with
:P
6It's AT&T here.
XD
they're basically the spealization of 7Zip
*specialization
just extract it
4...Hmm
4What do you guys think?
4I'm cool with it, I guess
it brings too many problems
11it does?
6It would be way too complicated.
yes, the fact that you'd have to moderate two rooms simultaneously
8extraction inside an extraction
it simply isn't viable, and would result more difficult
6People going "I WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS THIS PONY" too.
however, I'd like to know something
11Point.
is there a way to limit chat speed?
8extracted, what do now?
we could limit each person typing to a 15-second interval
4Isn't there a way to limit how fast people respond?
4Like DCD is saying
Hipster: http://www.niharsworld.com/2008/06/16/use-virtual-audio-cable-vac-to-solve-missing-stereo-mix-problem/
11There's a way to set a time limit between someone's posts, like what Ponychan has.
6Of course right after Dari left...
8damn, we should have asked dari while he was here
4A script, possibly?
other than that, no clue
4DARIIIIIIIIIIIIII
8omg
6HIPSTER GET OUT OF MY HEAD
4*weeps*
11And again, that would be Dari's forte.
What?
6MAGIC
8for realz
11Figures that our master of the chat is in another country.
11I saw somepony who was seriously considering changing their name to Rainbow Dash, despite being a guy.
6dari, teach me everything you know about chat.
11ponyshrug.jpg
6In ten seconds flat.
8silver, its the same guy
11oh.
11lol
8which would be epic as hell
11Damn Magnet, how does he work?
6But dari, do you know how to set a time in between letting people post?
8yo DCD, that link you gave me was junk
8it jumped me to like 4 different spam sites
http://i.imgur.com/OTZur.png
I want to do this at a sporting even now
XD
dunno hipster, I know naught of Virtual Audio Cable
Pretty sure you could only set that up if you are running the network yourself, so have access to services, other than having a script that kicks people who say more than a certain number of lines in a number of seconds.
8heres the problem with that
11damn.
so
8people who do things like this
8oh
8my
8goooooooooooooooooood
11we don't want to kick people just because they talk too much
there is an access command for that?
11and do stuff like that.
4Damn, I do that for emphasis -_-
8if you break them up like that for comedic effect, you could end up getting kicked
mods obviously won't have that problem
since their job is to talk and all
8but still
11It would still effect viewers
I mean you could make a script that sets +m if a certain number of messages goes into the channel in a certain amount of time, and which removes it after 3 seconds or so.
11And again, we don't want to kick somepony just for doing a silly joke.
Though I don't see how that'd help, because people spam loads after +m has been set.
11Yeah, because then the spam goes FUCKING NUTS when the +m is lifted.
I hope its not too bad
sup :V
6Hey.
I'm here
10Nice
8hey astray
11If we had more mods, we could split into only two rooms.
who are the ones?
Wow
6HI!
O,o
6Me.
8sprinkles
and?
11But I don't think we're at that level just yet.
11Sprinkles.
11And sprinkles.
:V
11and Hipster.
oh
I need to pratice more
it sucks
8i still dont know what to do with this VAC though
6But dari, could you try and look into it for us, since that's really your thing.
11I think he has, sprinkles.
I'll see if there's anything I can do other than setting up an IRC server.
Though I can do that if needed.
11If that's the case, then we might as well do the whole Pony Server thing as we planned. :/
11: /
/me 5rolls around
what I wish to know is
when both of ya have dl'd the thing call me :V
what's the progress with the Notifications-to-Viewers system?
maybe that would get you on TV
8are you talking about the listserv?
11Damn. I completely forgot about that.
6Working on it now, Astray.
D:
in that case maybe not
11Yeah, that's what he's talking about, hipster.
4I hai
4*Oh
I wonder if you can set +m on individual users.
5Hey~ 8D
8no movement on it yet that i know of
11Sprinkles, Hipster, Astray: It'd be easier if you three got a room of your own.
http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1308086721797.gif
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
DEM TITS
11#Training
4all I see is a picture of 4chan.org
6I'm still watching this part of the chat though. XD
4I agree :3
but its not straoght
straight*
hey Roly Poly Chan
4Wait, why are you suggesting Sprinkles, Hipster and Astray have their own rooms?
5:|
5Lol hi.
4Does it have to do with their streaming capabilities?
I suppose I could setup a system where everyone gets a voice upon entry and +m is enabled, you say more than a certain number of messages in an amount of time and you lose your voice for a set amount of time, and add commands to remove/add everyone's voice of course.
6No, ghosties, you silly filly.
10Use a ruler next time?
8just so that our stream training doesnt conflict with the rest of stuff
So you can still mute the chat.
11Ghosties: so Astray can train them without mod chat interfereing.
How does that sound?
10Either way, I don't think it really needs to be any straighter o.o
4What about me ._.
6Then we'd have to unvoice EVERYBODY and revoice them during/after the lotto.
11Ghosties: Are you training to be a streamer?
As I said.
well only that closeup tall building is mess up
I could add a command for that.
4Well, for one, my UPL is complete shit
6That would work, then.
I thought I had it straight but I didn't
oh well
4So I couldn't stream if I wanted to
11So it's a no.
I'll do it when I have time, how long should people lose their voice for, and how many message would they have to say in how long?
thanks
Normally about 6 messages in 8 seconds warrants a kick on IRC.
4Which is what I thought was the reason for Hip, Sprinkles, and Astray having their own rooms was because they have the UPL to stream. It's no biggie, it's what I thought in the first place
10You're welcome
/me 7simmers metaphorically.
8sounds good to me
11Shorten it to 5 for 5 and I think we have a good setup.
hey drfinator
6...hmm...I apparently have run out of food...
hey Quany CHan
Fine, I'll do it when I have time, but now I REALLY have to go.
5Hey Quan, hey DRF. :3
6k
11goodnight, Dari
4See ya dari
11Sleep well.
4Yo Quan
8see ya dari
6You've got all week, no rush. XD
6G'night.
Thanks, cya.
8sprinkles, im down to just the food i dont really want
03httttttttttttttt

6I have NO food, silly.
8it was glorious
okay
!script !pokemon on
The !pokemon script is now on.
11You should get some Ramen. :P

11No, we don't.

I agree
HOW CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN?
11Easy, I have a cock. :P
trannies have cocks too
:3c
and faggots
4What are you implying Astray?
I'm implying nothing
11Ow.
7Now, I, on the D&D alignment system, fluctuate between true neutral and lawful good. Rebelling is not my strong point. o3o
I'm merely stating that having a penis does not make you a man
4Well
11....
4Biologically, it does
11abandonchat.gif!!!!
11....wow, that actually worked. >.>
4IT SURE IS QUIET IN HERE
biologically it makes you a male
I think he meant "we need to see some tits"
not a man.
8well, this chat took a turn for the worse while i was texting
/goes back to work
EW THAT FACE
Ew this ...text
Rebelling needs to be done
;P
7Yeah, if I could care less about emotions (read, literally, and not the misinterpreted version of).
11Anywho, I'll be working on the "It's Pony Night!" vid tomorrow through Friday. And with my knowledge in After Effects and Premier, I can even throw in a little something for Brony Movie Night at the end of it. *coolshades*
8awesome
/me puts on headphones and plays some music
4Sweet man
4DAT PLUG
Since I'm getting confused by your sentence order/point
8let me know when you're done with it, and i'll send it to Sethisto in the weekly email
!sneas
11I'll likely just throw it onto Youtube. See how much hate I get for it.
11It'll be my very first Youtube vid
4I'll brb guys
Maybe you can summarise your rant?
7Okay, in teal deer form: Raging (if you can call it that) about parents that think you're their ambitions.
11k
Blue deer do not exist...what
7tl;dr.
8i mean, send me the link after you post on youtube
Well most parents are silly and don't know a thing :P
11I understood.
Or are just crazy, those are dangerous
11So, other than the training for HIpster and Sprinkles, is there anything else to discuss here?
8listserv
/me 7is too nice for actual action. o.O
11I thought we pretty much agreed that we just need ARGH to tell us how to work it?
I just go verbal or do the exact opposite :P
8do you want to run point on that?
(Of what they want to do, that is)
11Which reminds me, I haven't seen a daily /oat/ in a while.
7I suppose, but it's not like you can actually change anything. v.v
11You mean do I want to go through with it?
Patience changes everything eventually
7Yes, yes...
8can you talk to him about it
8?
7A year or two of high school left.
4There's one other thing I wanted to talk about, but you guys go ahead
11All I gotta do is wait for the next Daily /oat/ thread and I can bring it up with him in there.
8and also let him know what our movies are this week
11Can do.
http://i.imgur.com/0WuTI.png
11What is it, Ghosties?
11We covered just about everything else.
8i guess you can email him or post it in the /collab/ thread
11there's that too...it's been inactive otherwise.
4I hope you guys don't think this too forward of me, but I wanted to see what you guys thought about making Sprinkles a full op
rawr
Hey everyone :)
Guesstimation or truth?
:P
8im for it
8i actually emailed DCD about it
4I want Sprinkles to be full op
4He's clearly committed to the BMN, he brings ideas to the table, he participates
7Whaddya think?
Truth?
8i would be surprised if it isnt unanimous
Ghosties, I want a room full of lolis.
haha
You seem uncertain about it

4Rebecca Black's 13, man
4I think
8too bad shes annoying as shit and way, way underage
7Relative.
Add some compass points and a tangent?
7I'd rather not share more details about my life, but I've got to oblige to more of my parents' commands.
DCD
DCD
8and not particularly attractive
DCD, can you explain for me?
:D
because I'm lazy and I'm teaching the guys on the other chat
11I'm not
11It's only Hipster and Sprinkles.
I'd explain, Astray
but I don't know shit about her
cause I don't give a shit about her
bro
their arguments:
she's 13
11...
and annoying as fuck
explain it now bro
8"she's 13" /conversation
11Underage.
11End of conversation.
oh
OH
you guys gotta know
It's Astray
:3c
I ain't gonna explain shit
/thread
4She's underage mang

Age of Consent = 14
trollface/jpg
4Where is Astray from?
hell
:3
8still weird
10!sneas
10!umbreon
/me still belongs to Espeon for 0 more seconds
10Blah
8also, i'll just leave this here: http://www.theonion.com/articles/man-knows-unsettling-amount-about-nationwide-ageof,3716/
6...why are we talking about Rebecca Black?
bbl
4Astray likes her
8astray brought it up
4Apparently
4Or something
10Seeya
8good idea
6I agree.
4So Sprinkles
4Silver
11Ghosties
4What do you guys think about making Sprinkles a full op?
11I'm good for it.
8lol, asking sprinkles if he wants to make himself a full op
11...did Bristle ever show up on Friday? I don't remember.
8he did
4I think yeah
4He did
4But I guess we agree, Sprinkles should be made full op
8he was here for pre-show and most of the movies i believe
11well, he wasn't around for long then.
11either that or was incredibly quiet.
11Or I wasn't paying attention.
8he was quiet
baaaaaaaaaw
8he was here the whole time though
you guys are too serious :3c
4I have to agree with Silver. It's a touchy situation and she's only 13. Not getting my hands in that
8unfortunate phrasing, ghosties
4Lol touchy
I'm playing Brawl nao ;D
4*ahem* Still
ba-dum-pshhhhh
XD
so brb for awhile
4Silver's uncomfortable with it, so let's stop talking about it
8yes, lets
:3c
11I don't seem to be alone in that either.
ok, then, let's talk about rape, pregnancy and abortion
TONIGHT ON BRONYSTATE: POLEMIC NIGHT
:3c
8...anyway
8shall we discuss ponies?
good idea.
11Rape's overrated, Pregnant people are either lucky or stupid, depending on the situation, and abortion is all about personal beliefs. /topic
I heard there was this guy who had sex with ponies
is that rape?
4It's bestiality
it sure is bestialism
8rainbow dash is my favorite pony
/me pokes Altair
:3c
6My favorite pony is the one with the mane.
11ha
My favorite pony is...
oh wait.
11So your least favorite is the bald pony?
I don't even like ponies :V
4Wait
YOU'LL NEVER GET ME ALIVE
8waitwut
/me runz to the hillz
/me runz for his liiiiiiiife
10It's a polished Soviet
/me 6tacklehugs Astray
/me dodges
you have a dick bro
I have no interest in that
4Back
4Don't think you'll find any girls here mang
4FiM is for men anyways
girls wouldn't come here bro
that's the sad truth
8i know, FiM is just too manly for them
you mean too gay right?
8nope.avi
4If you say so *shrugs*
6YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED INTO THE HERD
6RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
8plus, dont women usually love gay guys?
8if it were gay, how come there are so few women?
niggas, Astray's gonna Astray
women LOVE gay guys... to never have sex with
8thats fine, FiM isnt a dating site anyway
6...Astray's a bigger parasprite than me.
6I like him. :D
the fuck is a parasprite?
6lawl
another name for troll, Ast'
8bahahahaha
the pony equivalent, either
4Oh boy
4This is going to get interesting
:V
4DCD
not really
Astray takes pride in being the Brave Troll King
4In any case, DCD, we've been talking it over and we were wondering you'd be fine with making SirSprinkles a full op
ACCESS ADD SirSprinkles 5
SOMEONE FORGOT THEIR IDENTIFIERS?
4Hello?
oh
4!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
8lol
my keyboard derped in me
:3c
10Hola
4So what do you say, DCD?
he'll do it :V
Ohai
4Nice
the only reason I hadn't done it before was because lazy
4Ahahaha
4Congratulations, Sprinkles
SUDDENLY, OPKICKWAR
now
who's streaming?
STREAM SOMETHING BRO
6Hipster
6Also, no audio
8should be streaming
6I got audio, nevermind
8why dont i have audio?
6Just really quiet
6Try again
8is it working?
6Yep.
11We got rickrolled.
I see
11And lag.
it's capping your mic audio
6So much lag.
8how do i reduce lag?
Lag can be because of your net connection
Hipster_Brony have you tried the VAC?
8okay.jpg
or your computer being unable to process the video
probably the latter
8what do i do with it?
DCD
4Congratulations, Sprinkles
4Jesus, he's been lurking this whole time...
4You're a fast fucker, good Sir. As soon as you were given Op
what do you use for the audio cap?
Stereo Mix
4Wait, who's currently streaming?
there
8me
but Hipster's can't use it
4Ah
also I don't see shit cap
that's because you're a nigger DCD. stop stealing his audio
I know you're my nigger version, but DAMN man :VB
:V
4COULD IT BE TRUE?!
reminds me of the time when NIGGA STOLE MY ELECTRICITy
6Hey, where is it going to pull audio from?
your mic
6My mic?
4Lag
so if you start fapping, we'll know
11The lag is incredibly.
6Well... any way to change that? I'm in a cafe?
8yo, DCD, what do i need to do?
DCD, audio's with you.
since I stream from my mac, I have the app capture the video
so yeah
dunno how to solve that
also
6LOL I HAVE OP AND HALFOP SO I'M HIGHER ON THE LIST THAN THE OPS
the lag can be due to 2 things
Sprinkles: NOPE
FUCK YOU SPRINKLES
8lolz
6It shows me higher.
ONORAY SPRINKLES
you don't, you have Access type 5
6...aw, now it doesn't.
:3c
6I HEAR YOU LAUGHING
4Bwahahahaha
4Poor Sprinkles
8DCD?
8wat do?
no signal ye-oh there were go
so hip
well you'd have to tinker with
6But yeah, any way to make the audio come from not my mic?
VAC
what can you tell us aboot your net connecshun?
but dunno how to do that, so it captures your audio
8astray, what do you need to know?
here
try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5DJPV8Mbbk
4Hai
your connection speed. how fast can you upload shit
www.speedtest.net
8 6.5 MBPS-ish
stop streaming, take the test
for UPLOAD?
8already did
8yeah
or for download?
oh ok then
8upload
then your net is NOT the problem
4Strange
lags like the fist of the north star
8is it because my comp is slow as shit?
problem is your computer being unable to handle the amount of data
what can you tell us aboot your GPU?
and processor
and RAM
8its a straight out of the box HP laptop that I got 3 years ago
8filled with tons of shit that makes it slow
oh
8thats all i know
then yeaaaaah
6ARGH 7z files
8im terible with technology
you'll most likely be unable to streasm
due to: 1: laptop
8okay.jpg
4What about Sprinkles then
they usually have shitty graphic cards
4He has a higher UPL then Hip
6Working on getting the VAC up.
4Alright
now, if you excuse me, I'll be masturbating to Rebecca Black
and Jenna Rose
trollface.jpg
time to get her jeans off
4Ewwww
4fag
trollface.jpg
obviously the course of action to do is
to ship Trollestia X Astray
who?
Parasprite Queen X Brave Troll King
8damn, silver left already, so he cant draw it
4Where does that leave Molestia then?
6Need to dload 7zip... >>;
4You don't have winrar, Sprinkles?
6Not since I wiped my comp a little while back.
6Didn't need it since then, so forgot to download it.
DAMN SON
winrar is like the FIRST thing you ever download on a new comp
6I. Forgot.
6Like I said, didn't need it at the time.
4I hate you Sprinkles >:I
6XD
4Hardy har har

I believe so
didja click "start"? :3c
6I stopped it.
6I was having a problem on my end.
4What's wrong?
6My sound just started repeating itself.
6Endlessly.
Silly Pokèmons
oh
that must be because you have the "audio" preview checked
6It's not.
6It's a problem with my VAC setup.
6Since it's still doing it now.
then it's because there're burning trainginas everywhere

8thats the border color
8you can change it
4?
4Oh

8the video keeps dropping on me
6I turned it off.
8i think it's in config
6To fix the strips.
8in settings on the far left if i remember correctly
8i just changed it to black
I should be happy that schools over...but it kinda just reminds me that after next year I'll pretty much lose contact forever most of the people I know
6On what program?
even the people I just talk to casually I find myself missing a lot...dunno why
10Because you've been with most of them for 3 years
8the 2nd thing

10Well, I gtg now, so seeya
10I gtg, seeya

8*shrug* i guess you could wait until DCD or astray gets back in here
4CONFOUND THOSE INTERNET PROBLEMS. THEY DRIVE ME TO eat

/me randomly huggles Kosoveon
8how are we going to stream if it doesnt work with either me or sprinkles?
04LL~
/me huggles back
okay Sprinkles
go to the settings tab
make sure it's set to 30 FPS
also make sure all boxes are left unchecked, except the ones in the top right related to resizing
make sure linear resize is checked, for example
everything else must be unchecked
check for those settings
in my experience there's terribad lag with anything else checked
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 4Omastar.
life is complicated
but worth every minute
6Everything is set like that, already.
hmmm

6trying again
12besides you are too far away XD
6Any issues?
gimme a sec
bootan
04bbl
wow
some stuttering on this end, but I suppose it's serviceable
One Republic's Appologize on AM
6Lemme try a different video.
night all
6This one is just plain bad.
o/
6Good?
Not really'
XD
I hate being a nocturne. :|
well how far is baldwin from your place o3o'
hm, I barely noticed stuttering this time
well gents
I'll be leavan'
nighto
6The stuttering is only because I have to use VAC.
I'd say
6It's the very best I can get.
most definitely serviceable
6G'night Astray.
6AWESOME.
I'd say you should try to bump up the quality to the stock BronyState settings though
6video or audio quality?
as in, 500 Kbps Vid/ 64 Kbps Audio
6Just a sec.
6The vid is at that, the audio isn't.
6Restarting.
/me plays the Nocturne of Shadow
6Good?
play again
I'd say it runs well in this end
we'd have to ask other viewers
6Awesome.
6Yeah.
12mapquest on shortest distance
12says 118.36 miles
seems the lower quality is due to the youtube vid
but it's serviceable
6It is due to the vid.
4Alright, so what's going on?
6Restart your vid, Ghosties.
4I did
6We want to see how it's working.
4It looks good so far
6Awesome.
4No lag, video looks good
6Yeah, the main problem is I forgot to turn some stuff off, it seems.
4It's kinda low quality, but otherwise it runs fine
6This YTP is just low quality in itself.
6Lemme try something that's higher quality.
4Alright
6Switching.
6Look good?
4I can't hear anything : /
4Oh
4Hello guys
4Nevermind
4my volume was low
6LULZ
6Is the vid good?
4The only thing is that it looks kinda lower quality
4Hmm
4It looks...fuzzy
Good evening everyone.
6Hmm... that's odd.
4But again, otherwise, this is great. At least it runs fine
6I'm giving over 500 kbps video...
4Maybe DCD can help, or Astray later
6Easily.
the vid is much better than the last one
okay, that seems to clinch it
4It doesn't look "clear," you know what I mean, DCD?
6The last one was a poor quality vid.
now we should deal with the last two things we're missing
Ghosties, whatchoo mean?
you notice small scanlines?
that's even in mine
I believe it's due to the size of
Sprinkles' selected area being smaller
6It's because the video is resized smaller.
4Like the text looks blurry and the video looks fuzzy
ergo, next time, try making it a bit bigger
yeah most definitely the fact it's zoomed in
Sprinkles
btw
6?
did you set the resolution in FME to 756 x 500-something?
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
6Yep.
4Sprinkles you chose this ep right?
6Or not. Oo
6lol
6One sec, the resolution reset itself somehow.
in any case
we should get working on two things
4You never got that Applebloom trip, did you XD
6No, I did not.
first, getting someone that can useBronyState to stream the S2 episodes live as they air on the Hub
second, the whole "BronyState Viewer Notification System"
4Viewer Notification System?
6The listserv
6Restarted
I kind of meant
a sort of
6Video still good?
okay so
change it back
6XD
cause it's stuttering like shit now
or just lower it a bit
anyways I meant some sort of newsfeed for BronyState viewers
so they can know news about the channel
6This good?
be notified of out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
6>out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
nope, stutteran
6You mean whenever I'm on near every night?
6Okay, fixing.
since a big chunk of our viewers
are not from Ponychan
6I like this idea.
so yeah
basically
a news feed
4Back
maybe we should do like The Daily /oat/
and make an e-mail as well
kind of a newsletter
4Oooooh, so there's gonna be a twitter for the BMN?
I'm heavily uninclined for "Twitter"
As I dislike Twitter
and not everybody has Twitter
4Hello?
6I. Dislike. Twitter.
that said we could probably make a RD-Network group for the BMN
4Look, I hate social networking as much as the next guy
and post updates there as well
4But having something for Twitter would give us more exposure
okay so
e-mail Newsletter, RD-Network Group, Twitter Account
6running again
those three might be
obligatory
any other ideas
?
4...facebook?
smooth
6DCD, is it good again?
albeit much lower quality than before
it had a bit more higher quality earlier
4Why can't I hear anything?
6It should be the same quality as when it was running smoothly before.
4And my volume is high
well it wasn't looking fuzzy for me before
and now it does
6I stopped it.
4That was much fuzzier : /
Ohai?
6Should be good now.
6Forgot to fix something.
6>>; Had to reopen the program 'cause it froze and forgot to fix things.
6It good?
4Fuzzy, and I can't hear anything
6DCD, you have audio?
6Hm...
4Ohai
4It was quiet here
6Good now?
4Yeah, I can hear now
6Alright, brb
4Alright
6Have to go afk
4Okay
Okay so
E-Mail/Rainbow Dash Network Group/Twitter
I was also thinking on adding a news tracker bar
to this page
4A news tracker?
4How would that work?
more like a ticker
I just want some sort of news update here
4Well, I mean, we do set the topic message to display what's currently going on manually
4But do you mean you want something that's always visible?
well, maybe that's not a good idea
I'm not too keen on using facebook for that
also DAMMIT APPLEJACK
6back
also I hear no audio either nwo
you might need to bump it up
4I hear audio
6It's low... apparently.
4It's not very loud though
6Working on it.
6How about now?
570+ pony pictures
that bus forum's gonna be trolled to the pits of hell
4It's still sounds the same
6Silly fillys that totally weren't directly next to eachother in Ep. 1 or anything...
4Shhh
4Don't talk about that
4The creators didn't want you to know
anyway
bbl soonish
4Woah
4It's lagging
6It's my comp. I just opened like, four things.
/me now belongs to Hooh54 for 14 minutes
/me 4runs for life
4Ah
6...oh, Cupcakes.
4These were SFW cupcakes
6WOW SUDDENLY HUGE
4THIS EPISODE'S ABOUT RELIGION
6IT IS.
4THEREFORE, I HATE IT
6Got sound?
4Yes, I have sound
bbl restarting computer and getting food for myself
also shower
4No, but seriously, I don't get how people can say the ep's about religion
6LOL EP SWITCH
6It's not really.
6It can be applied, but really shouldn't be.
4Maybe it's about having faith in your friends
4NAHHHHHHHHHHH
6It... really is.
4That's too farfetched
6NAAAAAH
4IT'S ABOUT RELIGION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4Bleh, some people
yay he left
but yeah
/me hides
I'd say that you should just deal with Audio
you using VAC or Stereo Mix?
in any case
if you have problems getting the material for Friday
I can probably point you in the right direction
6Probably should now.
6Also, fark, how have I not yet finished dloading all the pony eps? Oo
6VAC, DCD
4Have you downloaded the movies, Sprinkles?
6Nope.
6Didn't know I'd be doing this until today, so not yet.
4*nods*
6Fucking lightning rods, how do they work?
Sprinkles
6?
y'got no Stereo Mix?
6Nope.
what OS are you using?
it might just be out of view
if you're in Vista or 7
6I probably do.
6I'm in Vista.
6k
and select "show disabled"
if Stereo Mix is there
enable it, lower its volume
it should also help with the suttering
6No Stereo Mix...
well
seems VAC's the only option
you might have to tweak around with it
>:c
6I have been.
6It was the mane problem in the first place... >>;
4You belong to ME
4Or not
12D:
/me sits on Umbreon
!umbreon
im not ignoring you D;
12noooooooooooo
Yessssssssssssss
12laugh at me all you want
OK :3
12but i just got the gender change journal entry XD
12on mabi
Good for you
4Rarity sounds so retarded there
anyways guys
12i guess there wouldn't be much phrase from a guy who rebirthed like 200 times
gotta go
night
6JUST LIKE THIS CHAT
6G'night DCD
g'luck on Friday
6ty
4Night DCD
Umbreon I've RB'd 62 times
4Well, Sprinkles, here we are again
6Indeed.
6Also, it probably won't be this bad on Fridays since I'll be streaming forever. XD
6As opposed to the postshow lasting for such a short time.
4Oh my
4You may take over for DCD at some point
6Well, his stuff is a bit better quality.
4Considering he already mentioned that he may not do this forever
6So when he can I'd prefer him to.
6But when he goes for the night I'd be glad to take over.
4I agree
4But man, you saved our butts
6justthatawesome.gif
4You solved a massive problem we were having with getting the stream out to the Euro guys
6I CAN COUNT TO BOOKS
4MAYBE
4TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH
4The other neat side effect is that we have something to watch now XD
6I know. XD
6I'll probably end up streaming even when there's nopony here, just incase somepony stops in. XD
4Stop clopping to ponies, haha
4There's a video specifically about Rarity making those sounds
4And it's about "stop clopping"
6Hello Glass_Arm
Hi!
4I AM YOUR GOD
4Wait
4wait
4wait
6XD
No you are not
4Sprinkles, would you like to do the honor?
/me giggles at Ghosties
6I AM YOUR GOD HERE
4I didn't mean kick me asshole
6XD
6You know it's cause your my pony.
4Yeah
4Mah pirate pony
12o-o
4I don't
Night probably.
03:<
4It's kinda lagging, Sprinkles
:<
Nii Chime
6It's 'cause I was on fb
6Better now?
4Yeah, but still split second lags
I'm on my mobile phone. what movie is tonight?
6No movie tonight.
4Not tonight, Glass_Arm
6Just test streaming.
6Movies are Friday.
4We're just working out the kinks for this coming Friday
Oh
4It's starting to look like you won't be able to stream without closing everything else but the stream :S
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
6I have /oat/ open.
What is /oat/ about?
6fbook lags my comp like crazy.
Where's Feather >:
nini Chime D:
fuck FB
stare at flanks
FlankBook
6I think my post just got eaten by the chat.
Repost then
6It was just that fbook normally lags my comp at least a little.
4What the
4Huh
4Oh
6I had to check on something important.
4 /oat/ is the random board on Ponychan
4I know that's late
4Don't care
Oh
funny name
heh
4Did you download all the eps, Sprinks?
must also be the furry board
6All up to a certain point.
6I dloaded most of them one day and then got lazy.
6I think the latest I have is E16.
6Yep, E16, Sonic Rainboom.
I need to download eps
so I can start making YTPs
4How does the vid look, Glass_Arm?
Which vid?
4The one now
wat
4?
4Refresh your vid to the left
I am totally lost
4Okay, see the video on the left of the chat?
6He's on his phone.
I'm on my mobile
4Oh right
Sorry :/
4Bah, nevermind haha
4 /oat/ is the furry board? Well, there was that Rule 63 thread of Spike the other night
4And everybody and their mothers whined about it
6Oo Wut?
/me doesn't bother to look up the rule
6Wut ARE you talking about?
6 63: There is furry porn about it. No exceptions.
4Rule 63 means "for every male character there is a female equivalent"
6...
Oh
6Darn.
6I was wrong.
That would be awesome actually
4It can be awesome
Unless it gets kinky
4But then most butthurt closet homo dicks think it's "sick"
6*cough4chancough*
^
4I'm sure 4chan loves it
6FAWK I LOVE THIS SONG.
6Oo How do -I- not have Show Stoppers?
4Especially considering you love Applebloom, freak >_>
6Apple Bloom is awesome.
6Deal with it.
6Also, may lag in a sec, about to start dloading movies and eps.
4Alright
6Though I have no idea where to get the movies.
4We can probably have a meeting tomorrow to discuss that
6Yeah.
6AND THEN LAG
4I'm glad you got made full op, by the way
6So am I.
6:D
4I was pushing for it when you were made halfop
6I know, I was there.
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
I am the next half-op
6lol dloading things = massive lag.
hurr
4Hmmm
jk
4*taps chin*
I haven't been here for movie night yet, even
4The secret to becoming a mod is a secret
*okay*
4Yes, I meant to use repetition :)
4Or did I?
4Fuck, I don't know
4In any case, you should come to the BMN
Ok
I need to make time
4Well, we have good news for you
:O
6There's going to be a second showing from now on!
Oh sweet
4Yep
When will that be?
4Saturday at 2 PM EST
6Starting at 2 PM EST on Saturday.
:D
That's perfect
4It lets people that weren't able to catch it the night before catch it now, but the main reason is to cater to the bronies in Europe
Oh
4Where their time is about five hours ahead of the U.S.
Because you love them too
4I don't love them
/me 4honestly had no idea to respond to that >_<
Love and tolerate the shit out of them?
6Look at all the clone bg ponies.
:(
6Also, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself.
4Whatever the fuck that means
No paradoxes pls
6lol
6Silly cat lady
4In any case, you're gonna find people that are Fluttershies or whatever, and Gildas like me
6And Pinkies like me.
6=P
4Yes
I must be the Twilight
lol
;p
bbl
bbl
4Are you a bookworm?
I read a lot
spend a lot of time
reading news article
antisocial
yup
4*nods* Yeah, you'd be a twilight
And I practice magic
with magnets
Oh and I'm atheist
very key
4So I bet you felt that Feeling Pinkie Keen was about religion, don't you?
Ghosties: I deeply felt it was
6I'm atheist. I just thought it was about trying to understand that everypony has their own view on everything.
6Not just religion.
4I felt like it was having faith in your friends
That fits as well
4Oh, Dragonshy
4WAIT
4NO
4Swarm of the Century
6lulz
4Fucking parasprites
4ruining everything
4quiet chat is quiet
4Huh, Glass_Arm left
6Well, it's not like he could see the vid.
4*nods*
4Sprinks, do you that I'm dominating?
6Which makes the chat a lot more boring, unfortunately.
4*think that
6Not really.
6I think you can be assertive, but so are a lot of people.
4Thanks, I think being assertive is a good thing. I really try not to be a bad guy. I mean, sure, I'm an ass but I do it for a good cause
03we're all avoiding you
6I tend to act very... jokingly.
4:(
6I'm like a half-serious parasprite.
4You do NOT mess with Fluttershy
6I am so Pinkie.
4Yes, you are definitely that pony on screen
4Not that one
6XD
4That one
6Oo how far back is your stream?
4Twilight is taking a parasprite
4Now pinkie is declining
4Trumbone
6Say when Rainbow Dash talks.
4leaves
4She's talking
6Wow.
4This is normal though
6So far back.
4Don't worry about it
6XD
4DCD mentions how the streamer sees ahead of everyone else
4Welcome newcomer
6Ah.
6XD
6Hello anon.
4Are you downloading?
6I am.
4Right, so that explains the lag
6So bits of lag here and there.
4Yeah
6brb
4Alright
4Hey, anon, are you seeing this vid?
4Well...fuck
6back
4WB
laaa
4Coooooooo
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
/me flees
4COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4For those that don't know, Latias noise
4IT'S RAINING PARASPRITES
laaa
6AND THEN MAGIC RUINED EVERYTHING
4Yep
4Stupid Twilight
6lol Pinkie
6PINKLEBERG
4Goodnight :3
4I seriously thought Pinkie's VA was the voice of Bubbles in the Power Puff Girls
4I can't believe it was Tara Strong
6I seriously thought so too.
6TARA STRONG IS EVERYWHERE.
4Yes she is
4Every fucking where
4Pinkie Pie
4Strutting like a boss
6THREAD EVACUATION IN PROGRESS
6Fillydelphia. XD
4Manehatten
6Yep.
6Canterlot = DC
4I thought of Camelot o.O But DC isn't farfetched in the least
4Hah, saved it
4Good job
4Next, dear Sprinks?
/me puts the Space Core, Rainbow Dash, and Nyan Cat in the chat
I will just leave them here
4Oh ho ho, Boast Busters
/me falls asleep
12yay
6Episode Trivia: The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie tastes like Blue Raspberry..
/me zzzz
4Really o.o
6XD
6There was a syrup thread that devolved (I didn't think they could either) into what TGAP Trixie would taste like... and apparently that.
4I remember the infamous menstruating thread
4Was that the thread?
6It wasn't.
6It was a thread that somepony posted the screencap of that thread in.
4Ah
6And then images of Trixie using a rope to get herself off, wringing out the rope, and drinking it. So. Disturbing.
4Dude
6Yeah, it was messed up.
4Sounds like a performance artist, haha. Kinda like what Trixie is, really
6...gog I love Rarity.
4BUT WHAT ABOUT APPLEBLOOM
6Apple Bloom is better.
6But Rarity is indeed up there.
4I think Rarity is probably my least favorite main pony
6I just wish I could be that fancy and proper.
4Too bad you aren't showing these on Youtube, then you could turn the captions on and have lols
6I know. XD
4I wonder if you went on youtube if the quality would be better...
6Not at all.
6The quality on my end is 720p.
6On youtube the best I could get would end up being 360p.
6Anything else buffers like hell.
4Weird
4If anything, it probably is because of your laptop then. DCD has a PC I believe
6It's the laptop.
6But still, something is something.
4Indeed
6It also probably doesn't help that this laptop is 3 years old.
4Well, yeah, there's that too
6I like how the wind starts before she starts using her magic.
4Twilight's a powerful fucking mage
4She may as well be the very best in Equestria, next to Celestia and Luna
6I call serious Mary Sue.
4Where?
6Twilight.
6She is a Mary Sue.
4Maybe, but it's not like she has a love interest or anything. And, she is the main protagonist, so, calling her a Mary Sue in a television show is a bit out there, no?
6Meh.
6I agree on the love interest thing.
6But I'm sure if she was put on a Mary Sue litmus, she'd at least get Uber-Sue.
4Meh, I guess
6But, meh.
4But only because she's mega powerful and she's the main character
6I get Uber-Sue on most litmus tests.
6XD
4litmus?
6Mary Sue litmus tests.
6Wow lag at the end.
/me 4has never taken a litmus test
6They're usually quite stupid.
4You like the CMC, don't you?
6I like Apple Bloom.
6I don't really care about Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.
4*nods*
6Though Scootaloo has her moments.
6SO MUCH LAG
4There needs to be an episode dedicated where Scootaloo is the leader of the group. Maybe that's what Cutie Mark Chronicles was
6Practically.
/me roars
4How funny
6ADVENTURE
4I mean, Sweetie Bell's singing VA is Applebloom's normal VA
6I know. XD
6Watch it for the plot.
4Wow
4That full grown pony had the cry of an infant
4How bizarre
:D
<e
<3
lol
4Huh, isn't that Cheerilee?
6It is.
6Also, lag.
4I didn't realize Cheerilee and Twilight were friends
6Twilight.
6Friends with EVERYPONY.
4Does that make her more of a Mary Sue?
6Gog. It's such a pain to have half my screen taken up.
4Just stop streaming man, no one's here right now and no one expects you to stream
6Nope.
4*sigh* Alright man
6It gives me a reason to watch ponies.
6I'd have my screen taken up by it anyway. XD
4Hah, right
hi
sup
how's it going?
not much right now
nothing much just got back from dinner
4Hmmm, perhaps you should have taken a cue from the Apple user on Ponychan and named yourself Apple with the trip "Bloom"
just updating the PS3 and writing a dA journal
6Nope.
cool
6Also, that's how one pony is already on ponychan.
I got both cd and vinyl today and the vinyl looks so kick ass
:D
it's like. half yellow, then there's green in the middle and gray on the other half
Sweet, what band is it?
Oh good.
6PEACHY PIE
the wonder years
My bamboo have problems
Oh yeah
*Bamboo Tablet
like you said yesterday
4Hmm, I see
4Oh well
have you listened to it yet?
bbl, gonna talk to it
no I literally just got home lol, ripping CDs now
aaaand I ate too much and now I have a stomache ache :C
D:
4In ancient times
4Hundreds of years before the dawn of time
I had my bacon sandwich and half my pancakes then I was like LETS BRING IN A SIDE OF FRIES and ate half of those
and
ghurogdhr
4Lived a strange race of people, the druids
IT WAS WORTH IT
XD
6I always picture "Bohemian Rhapsody" to this part of the ep.
what did you have to eat?
all the things I just mentioned
4I think of Spinal Tap's "Stonehenge"
oh haha
I missed that post
my bad
:P
was that today we were talking about that restauraunt?
it feels like it was longer ago than that
like it was yesterday
haha, it was today
my memory sucks
:P
XD this morning
6I want to know which of those two is Peachy Pie.
6Nevermind.
6I finally got a decent look at their cutiemarks.
I just went to have a chat with the Bamboo Tablet
Let's just say he won't be... living anymore.
4There was a thread yesterday concerning a recolor of Pinkie Pie in Cutie Mark Chronicles
6I did not see that.
4Or a pony that had the model of Pinkie, I mean
4Show it next, and I'll show you the pony
6Inkie Pie and Blinkie Pie?
6I don't have it.
6It's downloading right now.
4Oh yeah, drats
4What are the eps showing on Friday? I think The Best Night Ever is one...
4Don't remember the other
4Oh
4Dragonshy
6Oh... I thought I was on downloading Cutie Mark Chronicles... I'm only on Over a Barrel.
"Big Macintosh says 'Eeyup!'"
I lol'd
XD
like my store?
yup
4Oh well
I saw the schnuffel bunny earlier too and lol'd
4You should have them all at by tomorrow, I'd guess
6I will.
6It's only 10-20 min to download each ep.
4Right
:P
6lol I love the way Aloe and Lotus look.
have you seen the schnuffel bunny video?
I swear everyone finds it scary, but I think it's adorable
XD
yeah
4Wow, they're like twins
hahaha
it is kinda creepy I guess idk I think it's because his SWEEEETEST LOOOOVE is a fucking CARROT
yeah
VEGANS. THEY LOVE THEM CARROTS.
that part is weird
XD
yep
I bought this puppet thing b/c it was adorable and I just found out it's wearable OMG ;___; <3
she's nearly emptied out her SDB she said
:D
that's awesome
do any of your neopets have it being worn?
I JUST added it to my pteri :D
6PONY GAGA
:D
/me goes to look
4You know, I wonder how the target demographic (girls) feel about FiM?
6...that is a very good question.
4We need a report
6I love Photo Finish.
6We do need a report.
6...when did Carrot Top get orange hair?
4Didn't Rarity say green was an ugly color?
6True.
woah that's really cool
6lol Trollie Pie
4ForEEEEEVERRRRRR
4WAHT THE
4WHAT HAPPENED

http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=SpikeTheManlyMan
4Huh, my video went out

6One sec.
4Alright

6I love that only the vid is lagging.
/me throws in the earless bunny
/me hugs it too
6Working now?
4It's fine now
6Yeah, was just a random GIANT LAG SPURT.
4Some lag, but otherwise it's fine
6Might actually be the vid. I did just dload it and it might have issues.
4Hmmm
6CLOP CLOP CLOP
/me gets confuzzled that the rabbit has no ears
4Speaking of clopping, hehehe...
o3o
4WHOA
4Dat data
4You still have Aladdin Commits Suicide up in the back?
6I do.
4Why?
6I completely forgot about it.
6It's closed now.
4Oh, okay
6I was mostly using it to know where to line up the video when VLC derped.
4Ah
Something Has Happened!
	You are now eligible to use 'Gormball - Gargarox' as an avatar on the NeoBoards!
:O
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
and this marks my 150th av
:D
what's that av look like?
ooh cool
I have hardly any
it's an ugly grundo muscle dude
but w/e
I really wish I still had my old account
6This reminds me that I was supposed to feed my sister's cat...
6I'm sure my dad did it though.
just got the crossword one too
4Lol, you might wanna go check
so quiet...
6He did.
6I texted him.
4Cool
http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/Whatareyoulookingat.png
4RARARA, what are you doing in Nightmare Moon's body?
o.o
6I love how Nightmare Moon glitters.
4*GASP*
6I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING
4I AM CRYING TEARS
6MANLY TEARS
4I love how NMM's dark aura makes it look like she has an extra set of wings
6It's really awesome. XD
4And I think Luna is also voiced by Tabitha St. Germain
6Lulz
4Haha, I thought Pinkie was gonna burst out laughing during the sappy moment between Celestia and Luna
4When she does that "PFFTTTT"
6I know. XD
4Aha, CM Chronicles is finished
4I'll show you Pinkie's recolor
6Just finished downloading.
4Nice
4Would you buy a DVD of Season 1 FiM?
6At this point, likely not.
6I already have a way to have all the eps.
hello
6So unless it had something AWESOME that came with it.
2Hello to you too. :3
6But I am biased by being broke.
hello to MYSELF.
6...WHY MUST LAG?
6;-;
4FIM, Y U LAG
hi Icy :D
/me spreads Silver Wings all over the place
6I'm going to have to watch all the movies and eps at home in advance to make sure it's not the videos lagging...
4Right, well, you might wanna do that tomorrow evening
6Of course.
2Sorry I haven't been very active. Had some things going on in my life and by the 20th this month, my activity will be less. :/
4I'm gonna call for a meeting tomorrow evening so we can help you out
4DCD can probably tell you what he does
Awwww, can I ask?
doing that long ass wheel
6Silly Mexicans, not knowing how to clean floors. XD
http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/Together.png >>> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgozdfeNhA1qh979ko1_500.jpg
hope I get something good
like the avvvv
me too actually
Spot the goofs in the second picture
or a paint brush or something
XD
6I'm watching the floor cleaners that come in once a month.
I never get anything good out of it
but I'm always hoping
XD
2My E.E.G. test that I had last month was to test and see if I've been having seizures. Well, the test came back positive for seizure activity and I will be put on medication to help regulate my epilepsy.
4Don't give them any trouble, lol
6I'm not, I'm actually staying out of their way.
4*nods*
6It's just funny because they OBVIOUSLY have NO idea what they're doing.
4You should help them then
Eeep
6I'm not getting paid, and therefore, nope.
Stay away from that Pokémon episode
You know
That one with flashing lights
Wait
2The one called "Electric Soldier Porygon"?
Just stay away from flashing lights, K?
Yes
6I love Fillyshy's emo hair.
2I only watched it once and it gave me a headache, so I haven't watched it since. In fact, I haven't been watching Pokemon very much at all.
4She has it again in the ep with Photo Finish
well, what have you been watching lately?
4And she actually does look like an emo
6Yeah, in the one image.
2Movies and Animal Planet as well as playing Suikoden.
4Angel <3
4Aw yeah, here we go
4It's coming up
4Alright, now, in the flashback sequence for Rarity watch out for a blue pony with curly hair
4Here
4Her, in the cake
Suikoden, huh? I got the first game as a PS1 classic off of PSN a while back, and I enjoyed it. ^w^
mine should be at least close to done
2I like Suikoden and Crash Team Racing is another game I've been playing as well.
how long has it been going
I started it about two hours ago now
I suppose it sometimes takes three
6Had to rewind because of the fact that I'm ahead.
6LAG SO HARD
4That's fine
4Watch out for her
one time it took literally like
5 hours
D:
6I see her.
6lol Bluie Pie
if it takes tooi much longer I'm just gonna leave it running as I sleep
:P
4She really does kinda look like Pinkie
4She's Blueberry Pie
I'm getting pretty tired
XD
6lulz
:P
6Proof that Pinkie's story is a lie?
4I HATE MORALS, FUCK THAT BULLSHIT. I NEED TO PUNCH A CACTUS
6WHAT?
That Crash Bandicoot version of Mario Kart is fun, though I've only played a demo of it off of a Playstation Magazine Demo Disk I got years ago (and still have, ironically enough)
4Scootaloo in regards to "finding yourself" and your cutie mark
6Yeah.
6Twilight's mom has an amazing mane.
4She looks like a previous gen Twilight
4See that pony with the cherry on his flank?
6Yep.
4He appears in present time too
6Where?
4Coming up, after Twi's flashback
4In fact, he's there standing next to her
6Speaking of cacti.
any anime lately, Icy?
4Haha
6Also, ENTER DARK PHOENIX MODE.
4I CAN SEE FOREVER
2Not really. Only a few episodes of Inuyasha and Wolf's Rain.
4Banished
6LOL THERE HE IS
4Yep
/me 2hums Team Plasma's battle theme
4WITH THE EXACT SAME APPEARANCE FROM THE PAST
6Pinkie makes my comp lag.
4He never aged
4ever
4Him and Derpy literally are time travellers
6Oh Blinkie Pie and Inkie Pie.
4Or Octavia
4Since there's this debate on whether or not it actually is her sister from Best Night Ever
6I doubt it.
6Coat color and mane color are both different.
4People speculate that hair changes color over time
6Though I could see Octavia being an older sister.
4And that's true
4AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
4The fuck Pinkie Pie
4Seriously
6We need somepony to tell a story during BMN, so we can go "AND THAT'S HOW BRONYSTATE WAS MADE"
4Haha, I can try. I'm a writer, but I don't want to fuck anything up XD
I'm crying http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJo-Dnrv5pU
4DERP DASH INCOMING
my speakers aren't working D:
they stop working sometimes
good
4OH, I know what would probably convince me to buy a Season 1 DVD of FiM
XD
the sound
is
6The alt endings to this ep?
satan
4Yes
they stop working sometimes and restarting is the only way to get them working again
oh good
I am glad they aren't working then
4I would actually really like to see RD on an adventure into the woods to fight some monster
4FUCK MORALS
even the visuals are creeping me out
XD
4*PUNCHES THE WALL*
oh hey the wheel stopped
/me 2likes Burgh, Brycen, and N from Black/White
I got some weird food
what'd you get
D:
4Okay
Evil Blancmage
4Well
4It's getting late
*Blancmange
4I can't stay in this chat forever
6I'm going soon too.
My DS is dead, and I can't find my charger, so my team is stuck in stasis just before the gym battle with Clay...
6I just need to at least finish this download.
2Well that sucks. O_o
6Silly window, that's not what I clicked.
But Black/White is still awesome
What are thoughs on Rotation Battles?
I feel like going on a pop music binge
2I like them, but Triple Battles are just as good.
hah
do it
I dare you
:P
perhaps
every few motnsh I'll have a week where I listen to nothing but poppy beats despite my TTLY INDIE HIPSTER R00T$
o
:P
I saw a picture once that showed what foreigners think of the US
and Washington was labelled "Hipsters"
YUP
most the hipsters here reside in capitol hill
6Or not.
6Apparently I have to wait an hour before downloading again.
oh that reminds me
4FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
you know that venue I was trying to find
6Silly MegaUpload.
yeah
it was like
an old basement
4I think you should just go home after Winter finally Wraps up
O.o
6Sounds like a plan to me.
4And continue downloading tomorrow
it was awesome
there were lights hanging down from the ceiling with half of the light bulbs out
6Yeah, since I need DCD to help me with the movies anyway.
That's crazy
4Yep
haha
and I balanced on a sofa and a mattress to see
XD
I OFFICIALLY HAVE BEEN TO A HIPSTER VENUE
LIKE there were a ton of old bikes n shit
4There's an official Keanu Reeves and Agent Smith on Ponychan
4Fuck yes
I swear to god one of the staff members must just live there
it was like a house
6I approve of this.
4I definitely approve
that would explain it being so hard to find XD
and the door isn't even labelled or anything there were two doors in this outside room
4I seriously hope that the guy rping as Smith takes from the first Matrix Smith
then you open the door and there's just a sign that says ALL AGES THAT MEANS NO BEER and a creepy ass dark stairway downstairs
IT WAS COOL THOUGH omg
2Hi! *waves*
Hahaha
6Hopefully...
4I mean, I love Agent Smith. He's one of my favorite movie villains, but I hated how he kinda de-evolved into a typical "I want to take over the world!" bad guy in the second and third films
and when people were crowdsurfing they were swinging the lightbulbs around
4In the first one, he was strictly anonymous, strictly un-emotional, cold, and badass to the core
one min I should find the time on the video I took
6I am so just setting up a playlist for when I do the stream, that way I don't have to worry about finding the eps/movies.
/me waves back :3
4Sounds good, that way you're organized come Friday night
let me restart first
6Yep.
/me 2is currently playing Suikoden
to get my sound working again
4Holy shit, you're gonna be streaming Friday night
oh ok you don't need sound though lol
6I. Know.
oh
6I'm weirded out by this.
like just to see the lights swinging around
4Streaming to possibly over 200 people
well, I feel like listening anyway
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:04
alright :P
4They will see your every move inside that box
brb
6This is why I'm setting up a playlist.
4We should also go over how you're gonna do the pre-show and post-show
6And whether the drawing will be Friday or Saturday.
4That said, YOU are the streamer for Friday so that probably means, at least for the post-show, that you'll stream whatever you want.
6I'll probably still be taking requests during the post-show.
4That sounds reasonable
4Just, please, don't show Kamen Rider and sentai THE WHOLE TIME XD
/me is on this chat, is on another chat, is eating dinner, and is playing Disgaea 2 PSP ver
6I don't have Kamen Rider... or Sentai.
4Thank god, haha
6I have DBZ...
all at once
4I keep trying to get DCD to show Hokuto no Ken
4But he keeps pushing it off
6I might download a bunch of things throughout the week for just in case purposes.
2Bah! Stupid Windy for attacking Ted and trying to steal his Soul Eater Rune. =_=
4Yeah
4There's gonna be a bit to go over next mod meeting
i know, right?
6Which definately has to be tomorrow.
6Or... later today, rather.
What's your party?
2Tir, Gremio, Cleo, and Pahn now.
back
yay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:35
two people at once
:'D
is it a new game?
4Pretty much
6Troll Spike is troll.
oh I thought that was the 2 people clip
guess not
whoops
2Yep. I level-grinded Tir and Ted to level 11 before I got the Prosperity Rune.
nice
4Make up your minds -_-
2Plus, I'm doing money-grinding in order to get new equipment and leveling up my weapons.
6I love how they show Ditsy Doo in this ep, and people still debate about the idea of Derpy being Ditsy.
6Especially after Lauren said they were different.
haha, that does look cool
that was a party
I got 2 signatures on the vinyl I got too they were funny
"HEY DO YOU LIKE SHARKS???" "yeah!" "GOOD CAUSE I'M DRAWING YOU A SHARK!!!"
"AND IT LOVES YOU!!!"
4She did?
6Yep.
6A while back.
XD
6She even said Derpy Hooves when she made the drawing that sold for a ton of money for charity.
4Nice
do you plan on doing the insane and getting Cleo two Wing Boots?
and the other guy drew a drunk face or something
6Rewound for proof.
it looks like this (X~~~~~X)
6Paused on Ditsy.
2I'll think about it. I'm still a newbie when it comes to Suikoden.
XD
Uh
6lol Derpy recolor at last minute.
Is anything bad going on
4WHOA
/ has happened?
4BRONYPEANUT HAS ENTERED THE ARENA
6Hey Peanut.
4Is that Ditzy?
So..
6That's Ditzy.
I'm guessing no?
4Ah
4Bad?
4No, why?
6Nothing bad.
it takes a long time that early on to get 'em, but they're the best female accessory for a long time
Because I just finished talking to !!Scootaloo
and he said something about a "Calling all mods" thing, that I apparently was a part of
4What's wrong?
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
Was the target for a raid
4???
6...zuh?
So the only thing I could think of was bronystate getting raided
4...Ponychan was being raided?
2*snickers* Family Guy never gets old. X3
No
Well
lol
Fuck I have no idea what she was talking about
6Only thing I can even think of was a stupid post on the Mod Discussion thread that was literally just a bunch of letters.
/me 2will brb. Needs a glass of milk
6I swiftly reported it...
kk
.-.
4I remember earlier today when there was a thread on /oat/ where someone as anon was wearing a V for Vendetta mask
12wisconsin has some really dumb statistics with alcohol
EW
What she gave me was
"Something brony related, not of ponychan, and you posted in the thread."
4And it immediately got attention
Dont drink kids, its bad for you.
/me trollfaces
and something about the target of a raid
/me flees
and something about calling of mods
12lol
6How odd...
4Bizarre
6Is there even anything else?
....................Nope
6When/where did she tell you this?
Other than the fact that she decided to look through my post history
...random!
Right now
I'm talking to her on steam
6Odd.
6Could you ask her to be a bit more... specific?
4Okay, seriously, does EVERYONE have the mods on tap?!
6I don't.
6I don't know any of them.
4It's like everywhere I turn it's "Oh, Scoots and I are friends on Steam" or "Yeah, I totally have a cool relationship with Spike on XBL"
4I don't meant to harp on anyone, especially you, Peanut, but it befuddles me so much :S
6I see Spike in the GET threads, but he doesn't really talk to me...
Okay
Do one of you
have the mod thread
for BMN
6Yep.
4Uh
6One moment.
12Hi Umbreon
Because I have APSOLUTLY
NO FUCKING CLUE
What she wants
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/188267.html
/me 2is back
6There was a spam post in the thread earlier.
6I reported it almost immediately.
6It was just letters, really.
...................
"Mmh! Hey, there it is. "
*facepalm*
6...?
Also
4I'm so fucking confused right now >_<
I only have tabs on
!!Rainbow Dash, !!Spike, and !!Scoot
6So... what's going on?
4...it just befuddles me so
welcome back.
wb, icy!
6So... wtf is she talking about?
2Heh, Stewie is definitely the comedy relief of Family Guy.
rofl
Ok well
The rundown she just gave me wass
12Good night, everyone
Wake up. Get food. log onto ponychan.
2Good night!
Mfw there's a raid. Shit.
Call other mods in.
: Report of a post in this thread, which is a trollpost. An ICP
Notice thread seems to be of interest. Intend to keep tab open to read later.
Raid increases. Close a lot of tabs to better focus on task at hand.
Thread is gone. FUUUUUUUUUUUUU.
: I saw Peanut's name in it. he can help me!
4Did they successfully manage to parasprite anyone?
it is raining like crazy here
"Peanut, this thing happened, I need your help!"
same here
SUMMER FUN
6...XD
6Wow.
it's gonna be nice falling asleep to this though
6I'm so glad I'm the one who reported that spam post earlier.
4I'm kinda glad I wasn't around now. But did anyone get successfully parasprited?
dat global warming
Haha
IT SURE IS WARM OUT HERE, A WHOLE 48 DEGREES!!!
WE'RE ALL DOOMED
:P
/me 2goes back to playing Suikoden
honestly I'm sick of this weather menopause shit
you mean how one day it's beautiful out and the nxt it's storming?
yep
Yeah me too
I wish it would stay sunny
it's terrible too because the weather pressure changing makes my mom feel sick so she can't be comortable when the weather acts this way
me too
for more than one day
4And what thread in particular was it, Peanut?
6In the reason box, I typed "...do I even have to give a reason for this stupidity?"
Oh hey. This is irc.
6Hey BlazingStarshine
Hi.
What server is this? I'll connect through a real client, no the webchat.
*shrug*
6One second.
6You can use irc.irchighway.net
6Channel is #BronyState
oh no, I didn't know that
that's not good
6So, yeah... problem solved, I guess?
now I want the weather to stay nice evn more
mhm
Well
Maybe.
There we are.,
like I don't even need it to be 90 degrees but 70's or 80's would be nice
Apparently.. something about a raid.
yeah I agree
honestly it's JUNE I'm sick of this rain
70s and 80s are perfect for me
I know
So then! Hi.
6Raid of ponychan earlier, maybe? I dunno.
they should've stopped in April
6Hi!
april showers bring june showers
Haha
0But yeah
6Hello, test
6XD
Eheh. No, that's me seeing something.
Mfw hmasks don't change on mibbit.
6Nope.
Or Mother Nature comes around and "hurr durr what month is it again? oh well, I'll just roll a dice and if it's odd the weather will be shit today"
There goes that idea.
YEP
That test is a spy.
4Oh, Peanut, we made Sprinkles a full op
6We can see your hostname though, so we know that it's one person.
So. SirSprinkles.
0Congrats Sprinkles =D
Any relation to SgtSprinkles?
6None whatsoever.
4I was curious about that myself, actually
6I get asked that a lot.
Well, considering SgtSprinkles is a ban-on-sight name?
Yeh~
4It would be interesting if the notorious writer of Cupcakes really WAS underneath our noses this whole time
6XD
I doubt that.
Night All
/me sleeps
6Well, my old name in the internet got me mixed up with the writer of Half-Life 2: Full-Life Consequences.
6Since that's SquirrelKing
/nick BlazingSprinkles
haha. :p
12noooooooooooooo
oh I just realized
0You really need to find more less obscure names Sprinkles
I'm at 100 posts on SF finally
:P
6I do.
well, I should really go @___@;
100 POSTS
Mfw I used to be the only Starshine.
4Don't change your current Brony name though, man
Now there's 3 others.
I should too
IT'S A LANDMARK ON SF HISTORY
:P
6I don't plan on it.
4I am comfortable calling you Sprinkles
it is for me
0I'm the only Peanut
0=D
4Or Sprinks for short :P
6This is actually the only place I use Sprinkles...
XD
gnite
???
See ya
/nick BlazingPeanut.
0Ohgod!
0Nooooooooooooooo
8D
6I use creativename a lot...
6It does.
So does the server where I host the Pony Raid Shelter.
lol
6XD
0Pony Raid Shelter?
yeah..
0I..
Back when Derpy chat was the place to go, I noticed it was getting raided a lot.
Soo, I made a secure, secret Pony Raid Shelter.
0Oh
Being that it's IRC, it's controllable.
0I never went to derpy chat
0xD
+m, voice, etc.
So even if it got leaked.. and raided..
6I never herd of derpy chat
Reguler users were protect.
0All I know is /kick
ed
0cause that's all I ever use
6I know a lot of the commands.
I've been using irc since before I was 16. D:
0I'm a newfoal at this
0xD
Ah heh.
6I just recently picked up IRC, I just do my research.
12noooo
6It's fairly simple.
And secure.
0Honestly the last person I kicked was yelling at us calling us names for picking Starship Troopers as a Bad movie
6The only pain in the neck thing is scripts.
Especially considering the hmask.
6Yes, very secure.
It's a horrible movie. xD
I love it.
but it's horrible.
Mfw I have the games.
6>us
6>picking movie
4FUCK YOU STARSHIP TROOPERS IS AN A MOVIE
4Rinse and repeat'
4about five or six times
7So what's going on tonight?
6Oh yeah, that was picked by you, wasn't it Peanut?
6Nothing tonight.
4Yeah, it was picked by Peanut
0yeah
0I came in at the last second
6You actually just missed me practice streaming.
4He was gonna go with DBZ Evolution but decided against it
0and was like
0"I R HERE
-sighs-
According to my workschedule..
I don't get to come.
6I love how the past two weeks the B movie has been picked by a BMN mod.
4Why not, Star?
3pm to 11pm.
6It's okay, we'll be doing a reshowing on Saturday.
6At 2 PM EST
4Actually Sprinks, I also got to pick the b movie three weeks ago ^_^
0We're doing reshowings now?
6...XD
12lies
0Wow I am terrible at keeping up with you guys
6But did you show up at the last second, Ghosties?
truth
6Like Silver and Peanut did?
and veritas
4Nope
O sheeit.
I have Saturday off.
4I kept a very close eye on the thread
But it won't be the same.
4So when I was chosen, I was fucking ecstatic
6It was just decided today, Peanut.
c ya, Icy?
6Since I can stream, and will be on on Saturdays anyway.
I need to speak with an IRC pro that I can trust with classified informations.
6We figured it would be nice for the Eurobronies and those that would miss the movie night for other reasons.
4The main reason why we're streaming on Saturdays at 2 PM EST is for the Euro bronies who are hours behind the U.S.
6Hours ahead.
6 5 hours ahead.
4I swore I put "ahead." Damn, my mind is shot right now >_<
6Your head is full of ponies?
0Hmm
0Okay
0So Imma have to show up for that too
0right?
4My head is full of Agalloch right now
6It would be nice, Peanut. Especially for the first few weeks.
6But we are looking for more Euromods.
well, I'm gonna turn in for the night too. G'night, all!
4Yeah, Hip and the others are hoping that we'll show up for it. We don't have to, but they would be very thankful if we did
0I see.
0Alright I'll do my best
0to be there
0Oh
0Shit
0......................................................
0AND THEN I REMEMBERED
6XD
4I'll definitely be honest though and let you guys know ahead of time that I probably won't be modding the chat on Saturdays as well
6At first I was like, "Okay", and then I REMEMBERED THE FUCK UP
4At least, not every Saturday
4Haha, Sprinks
6It's cool, Ghosties
0My friend is having a birthday and wants me to come along
OH SHEEIT.
6That's why we're looking for Eurobronies
6We'll pick some out after a couple of weeks and put them on a trial period, sounds good, yes?
4Maybe we could have like mods taking turn to help mod Saturdays
6That would be most fair until then, yeah.
0and now before bafflejack gets any angrier at me and starts sending more assassins after me
0Brb.
6Have fun Peanut!
4Have fun man
6I keep forgetting to sign up for that game.
6They'd never kill me.
4I thought about it, but decided against it
6I post in like, 4 threads.
6All of them are "official"
4I know that I was the very first recruit to sign up for the Assassin game that became popular
6They wouldn't be allowed to attack me in them.
0They'll attack you up to page 15
Wait, what's happening?
0You.. Don't know about the Assassin game?
6It's a silly ponychan game.
Not fully.
4If you sign up in a particular thread, every night, the TC will pick someone to "assassinate"
Do they play favorites?
4And I think it's if you don't respond to their attack in time, they you die
4*then you die
6Also, as a GETter, I take pride in my ability to watch all of /oat/ at once.
0Nah they don't
0Well maybe
0Not entirely
I seem to remember them all attacking you at once, Bronypeanut.
Several times.
in an overkill manner.
0They constantly harass me.
Maybe they should be harassed back.
6They made that rule about not helping eachother because I would find each of their attacks, and post in the mane thread within 4 posts. XD
By the only roleplayer ever to have absorbed 3.5 mods!
0what's the .5?
Spike said no, use Twilight instead.
0Oh
6...lawl
So instead of getting just his firebreath and scale armor, I got his narcalepsy too.
o-o
0Well You, Spike, and Rainbow are the only mods I can really contact in a reasonable amount of time.
0-.-~
Watchu talkin' 'bout?
0Nothing.
ohai
6And then the chat was DEAD.
0No it wasn't
0Liar
I keldeo'd it.
6...dat pun
6Shut up and take my internets!
You know that image of spike..
Shutup and take my money!
That was legitimately used on me once.
During the whole Operation: Ponies for Bronies.
6I had an OC made about me yesterday.
Hm
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130802168927.png
/me goes to back up flame's services
People were sending me money without ordering ponies.
in case shit goes down
I told them to stop.
That pic was posted.
Everyone giggled.
6...lol wut?
mfw you don't lissen to my stories.
IT'S :c
6I was listening.
6The fact that they sent you money without ordering was what the "...lol wut?" was directed at.
oic~
13Nyan
13I have pink text
6...I need to clean out my image folders.
6The one time I need to find my image of Apple Bloom and Scootaloo with no Sweetie Belle, can't find it.
13I only use 1 image of Scootaloo
13And it's the "I'll make a more perfect world"
I USE MANY IMAGES OF SCOOTALOO LOLOL.
=|
13Scoot scoot scootaloo~
6I have a lot of Scootaloo, but that's mostly due to having a lot of Apple Bloom.
13All I use is Derpy now

4Wait
4So is BlazingStarshine !!Scootaloo on Ponychan?
6...
4It's 3:51 in the morning, shutup
What's ponychan?
6I didn't say anything, Ghosties.
6:p
4So then that's a no
13Starshine is a new brony
4Bronypeanut specifically said "Well You, Spike, and Rainbow are the only mods I can really contact in a reasonable amount of time." What does this mean?
13Nothing at all
I spy for Scootaloo.
4You lie, sir
I'M REPORTING TO HER RIGHT NOW.
4I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
13*Pokerface*
4...Seriously, I feel so fucking confused T_T
I thought that perhaps I could re-join the community as myself.
I see now that's impossible.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
I'll ban you harder than I would hitlar if you leak things.
4I knew it
4SUCCESS
4Don't worry
No. Not success.
6Leak what?
if too many people know I'm going to get de-modded.
I don't know why everyone has an obsession with knowing who mods are.
it makes us lose our rank.
13That's why I was confusing you
13but
4Look, don't worry about it. I'm not gonna rave to the imageboard "LOL I KNOW !!SCOOTALOO HERP"
13Whelp.
I already derp'd here a few times myself.
6>mfw people having obsession over knowing who mods are
6:/
nothing going, might as well forget being myself ever again.
6...aww.
6I liked the other name better.
4I feel like I upset you, or offended you. I seriously did not mean to
13Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrddddddddddddd
6...your face is awkward.
Because I was BlazingStarshine since February.
No one knows who the fuck I am anymore. And no one knows me as me.
As a mod, I have to watch every little thing I do.
4If you're so unhappy about all this, then why not just hang up the position like Cheerilee did?
Every little mistake is recorded and logged, to be thrown back in my face at a later date.
I'm not unhappy about being a mod.
6What, I'm not allowed to joke all of the sudden to break the awkward silence?
13It was about my face
13*tear*
4Well, it seems like you're facing a personal issue with your position.
6I never said it was your face.
6There are other people here.
6It could have been about dari, for all you know.
You're misunderstanding.
but fine~
4Sure, take it out on dari the poor chatroom
6Yay!
Also; you all done been trolled lolol.
Anyone can say they're a mod. :p
4Okay, it's 4 in the morning
Yeah. I work nights.
i was bored.
6lol
6To be fair, we don't even know you're the real BlazingStarshine
6And to be even more fair, I didn't really care in the first place.
13lol
6<SirSprinkles>: >mfw people having obsession over knowing who mods are <SirSprinkles>:
6lol emoticon didn't post.
4To be honest, at this point, I don't give a fuck
13Exactly
13Do that
implying BlazingStarshine is real~
Wait.
13Wat
4Okay, I feel like people are being abrasive and apprehensive
6I have seen a poster by the name of BlazingStar!shine or whatever.
6So, yeah.
Actually!!
I got a new tripcode!
6I'm just being me, Ghosties. :p
Wanna see it?
4Sprinkles, it's not you
6...meh.

13Or whatever that is
oh noes
Not antibiotics
13FUck the only secret board I've ever been to is /lol/
13Which is locked
13anyway
6Because ponychan needed MORE secret boards... >>;
12o-O
12that sick?
13Eeeeeyup.jpg
6What's that put ponychan at, 30 boards including the mod board?
yes, sadly
34.
6...wtf?
6Why?
:3
6Just, why?
Because Orange is high.
No, you mean /why/.
I was joking.
orange is not high.
=|
6I'm not surprised by that idea.
I don't need words twisted.
i think it was a bacterial infection in the lungs and airways
12oww
12get better soon
6...>>
6<<
i hope so too X.x, and thanks
12get some rest
no, it's only coughing, thats it
Coughing can be bad
So do take care
i will, thanks
6My favorite secret board is /moon/ :D
12coughing is really serious D:
6There needs to be a /spaaaaaaaaaaaaace/
yep, even when you spit out yellow stuff after coughing
or is it?
6SpaceCore would explode and then explode again.
12that's normal for bacterial infections
mmhmm
i still need to call my mentor at school for a few questions, otherwise my work will be in trouble when i get back X.x
If you feel anything in your throat, just spit it out
That will help get the bacteria out
Make sure you do it in the sink or during shower
i know, did that a few times, it tasted nasty
Whenever I get the cold, this kind of things happen to me as well
Yeah, it does
What
