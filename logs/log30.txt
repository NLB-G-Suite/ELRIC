04huh.
12Interesting. Iâ€™ll have to look into that

ME!
Like, the teeth are ALL out of place and in a line
Lazy design
I DID
I DID
3Dude, it's comedic effect.
6AWESOME.
12Someone is about to be ponyed
It's exaggeration, and cartoons aren't usually known for realism.

/me is unaffected

OH, Hilda is the BW character girl
Oh, and if it's a comedic effect
why arent we laughing
Then...it's not doing its job well

Something my sick friends introduced me to.
i am not make believe
LOL, it's a still image.
12I can handle it
No thanks, I'ma forget that link
If you want to see the effect, watch the episode.
Oh
Lawl, I'll shovel all the crap they've made me watch onto you then.

/me laughs
They're too busy thinking about ponies
...hahahahahahahahahaha
;o
12Bring it
3And ponies are bad why?
Hey.
04I reached a fatal problem x-x
because they are annoying creatures
Yes...?
04Is there a way I can on-the-fly move a registration point?
3Explain why, please?
i just did
04Like, it's at the top-left corner but I need it to be at the bottom
they are annoying
Darkdragon: Most probably because people post them everywhere, and go on about them too much.
Overexposure to something you don't like IS annoying.
04lol
Registration point isn't important though, why?
^
04so um, there any way I can remidy this?
04yes it is actually
3We don't post them in places other then the pony club, and the Last poster wins, and you can just not look at those if you wish
04erm
It's just... ponies!
12haters*
04so let's say I make it that the symbol is swapped with another symbol
Well you guys see
04it'll swap it in relation to the registration point
3Yes?
04So I could have Spinarak floating in the air
04When I need it to be on the ground
But oh well
3Okay, we could do something else. (Such as code spam~)
No.
You could move the mc inside the mc dynamically.
take Spamming to #ircgames
It doesn't matter, thought if you show me the problem it'll be easier for me to explain how to fix it.
3Dude, it was a joke.
:P

3okay.
That is all.

Oh guys

hm, actually
PM then :P
3and yet you bring it up anyway
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7PGKcikaGY&feature=channel_video_title
3Yup
02That won't happen if you annoy us with constant talking of it.
;o
MHT?
XD
lmao
3You should play a demo or something
Darkdragon should just create their own channel XD
I could help you if you want
3So, how's everyone's day going?
12Good :3
12Did not have to do much today
3I'm a bit sleepy, but I've been fine today~

02Anyway, if I don't get to sleep I'll come back. seeya~
lol
5See ya! (: Hope you can get some sleep~
6:00 ain't that early for high school.
I was always ready to leave the house by then
back when I was in xth grade.
Annoying but it's doable. lol
4Hello everyone
\o
I am waiting for laundry.
5It'd be early for me. /night owl
I've turned into a night owl these past few uh
months or years
doesn't feel like years.
5That's like a year and three-quarters. xD
4I'm a night owl too, I fall asleep around 4:00 am
5So you could say months.
My usual bedtime is around 2:00
4Whoa
yesterday it was 4:30
but that was a freakish occurrence.
5Once I stayed up until 3 AM finishing a paper. Uuugh. D|
Hm, it's 4:43 am over here.
I'm procrastinating sleep because I have an exam tomorrow. :P
4Procrastination is evil
Well, today.
12lame
Procrastination is the enemy of sleep.
And I like sleep.
4^
5But that was high school. xD
lol high school
then I stopped doing that because it was lame
5I wish I could fall asleep that early lol..
I used to be able to control my sleep hours. XD;
5I literally can't go to sleep earlier than 11 PM.
then I stopped doing that because it was lame.
4It takes me like an hour to fall asleep XD
How fast I fall asleep depends on how f#d up my mind is at the time lol
5I have to read or write for at least half an hour or I'll be up all night THINKING oh man.
If I had a normal day, it can take me a while to fall asleep
but if I've been up for say
4._.
eighteen hours straight
working on code
running solely on coffee and 5-hour energy
(not speaking from experience or anything)
Inspiration cleverly glazed onto a void which drains energy and willpower.
that is why I sleep without a pillow.
5O__o;
:P
5I couldn't do that. I have neck problems.
I have more problems than just my neck lol
my neck can gtfo
sleep comes first.
then sleep without a mattress.

It was weird.

You have a wife?
yes, clearly
4You have a WIFE?
4Whoa, dude

5It's not that weird to think a member or two (or three or four) could be married.
Well most TST users aren't that old, or old enough to even drink :p

Hmmm, good point.
Maybe just one of us should get naked, in that case.
4OH U
And get rid of the kittens.
I vote not me.

o_O
4The fact of getting naked in front of people is creepy
ok, can we please move on to a topic that is appropriate

04Dang.
04I thought that it was suppose to be "the game" everyone was waiting for (Duke Nukem fans that is)
it worked out well, graphics, gameplay
04prolly
>.> why must everyone compare games nowadays to COD?
it has the 5 B's :3
Bullets, Bombs Beer Babes
and...
erm
BEWBSA
YES
-A
yes nick, it did
overrated >:
i hate it when people brag about their kill streak
^
Including Halulzers
Ew Halo
After playing CoD for a certain amount of time all anyone ever does it do quickscopes.
As well as halo
/me runs
halo one was good, then they were going bad
lool
and from bad to shitshy
All Halos are bad :P
/me runs
halo one doesn't do ranks HAH
06<prince-dari> After playing CoD for a certain amount of time all anyone ever does it do quickscopes.
thats why i do it
06The most fun I've had in CoD for years is
I know.
06xD
killing nazi'x
Messing with them how?
hello
fun thing about CoD is the first two, killing nazi's
/me hides
06I dunno why
Nah.
!espeon
If they're any good they'd still kill you.
best multiplayer COD I ever played
then kicked for Tea-Bagging and botting
06Well 9/10 quickscopers are the ones trying to imitate the good ones :P
and YESH COD:UO, best CoD in the whole libary of them :3
6la~ (SilverSonic)
06and it's hilarious seeing them going to Battlefield and going WHY ISN'T THE SNIPER 1 SHOT KILL???
cheaters....
go old skool
*runs*
Unreal Tournament made frigging Deathmatch
PLAYABLE
Hm, I've never played battlefield.
yes Nick, the first one was good, the second CoD was playable, the rest is crap
^
Best games I've played in a while are RDR and GT5.
don't forget the rest of GTA
best games for me were proberly older ones
06End of
/me flops

06Of course but I'm mostly talking about the stereotypical
06"montage kiddies"
"montage kitties"
6I hate CoD (SilverSonic)

Yes

Zombies, oh lawdy
ZOMBIES!
GET OUT THA SHOTGUNZ!
06And lol yeah, mods
06:3
some mods i played screwed up my games
badly
like some for C&C Generals:Zero Hour
LOL, most fun you can have on CoD is go camp on rust with 1man army/danger close and a noob tube, then get a nuke and listen to the people on the other team afterwards.
On MW2 I mean.
i know right?
xD
12Espeon~
06GENIUS
hi
*Heros
*Heroes

everyone want the BEST FPS EVER?
Doom
Lawl
Always with doom.
they did it right the first time
yes
06battlefront
Goldeneye
06was tons of fun
when people brag about bad graphics i'll yell at them
and MOH: Allied Assault
and COD 1 *runs from flamethrowing )
TRY SNIPING THAT!
xD
actually wasn't wolfenstein before doom?
06lol, sidescroller
06gang garrison up in this
yes Wolf3D was before doom
also from ID Games
also Goldeneye was great because it was a movie tie in that is actually considered one of the greatest games of all time
no other movie tie in can say that
Isn't goldeneye getting a remake?
its already out dari
Oh.

03to it
03that's really really slow
Slow
03I know right
And wait
03at this rate it'll take s3everal years to transfer 2TB
One drive
Or RAID :P
03RAID.
SLOW RAID wat
03that's why I just said RAID array
03well
03I don't know
03it still says "initializing"
03whatever that means
03o.o
Or in other words, the RAID controller is having a hard time
Maybe it was too cheap
:o
03dude
03it's a $200 motherboard

03see
03my older one was 1156
Bah, never getting that :P
Can I have it?
03and I was trying to find a good motherboard
:o
03well, it's really really really hard to find good 1156 motherboards, since that socket has been discontinued
03I'm not even kidding
03it was only like $160
03for this
03(the CPU)
Wow
03my older i7 was $100 more
03yeah
Crazy deflation
:P
03but good 1156 motherboards were well over $300
03so it works out XD
03and as for you having it... it would cost me a fortune to send it to bermuda
I know, and I have a Mini-tower
03my motherboard is full ATX
I haven't checked the specs in ages
03wtf
Hmm :P
03that was 2.8, this is 3.24
03inb4 overclock
Nah
I'm using fans
:D
03I was
03but
03and get all dusty
03it comes pre-setup
03you just screw it in place and you're done

Since I'm living off of my laptop now LOL
Heya Credit
Yet that half GHZ difference
03wait
03what
03my CPU was not turbo
I know, but the Intel site XD
Odd thing
03heh
03well
03-k
03but 24GB of RAM ;o
IKR?
3RAM: Used: 1239/1908MB
;D
...IBM Z/System mainframe.
It's about three years old. :P
Room sized :o
:P
4 cabinets actually.
And... I believe about 128G of RAM. :P
Can it run Crysis?
:P
Install z/VM, and stick a few Winderp clients in.
And yes.
It can run Crysis.
About 32 at the same time. :P
Fun :p
Does it cost a billion dollars?
It also has I think about 100T of disk. :P
(Mmm... DASD.)
(What)
DRF
03LOL
03100TB?
YES
(DASD = Direct Access Storage Device :: IBM for hard drive.)
100T O>>o
TB
100T as in 100 TB.
Whoa
And again, look at the RAM.
128GB
The system cost I believe 10 mil.

WB Espeon

They're scrapping it for a bunch of Winderp clusters.
Good
(Congratulations <company> you're full of dumb.)
06Lol
At least there can be more USE put to them :D
And you'll actually have uptime that's longer then an hour. :P
03so Creideiki can I get this 100TB disk storage system for free?
/me runs
3Uptime: 3 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds
/me hides
I prefer BSD. :P
Same difference
Which is less "Apply head to wall."
03Creideiki, can I just have the hard drives?
/me hides
Have fun with hospitals and head dents

drf: The racks are FULL of hard drives.
03XD
03nice
And not nice SATA.
03but only 19"? I could make it fit
03what is it then, SCSI?
Either FICON or ESCON.
03o.o
03never heard of it
Welcome to the world of mainframe technology.
03i just want massive storage XD
03dude no way

7Cool. :)
!stats
Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
04kinda
04only lowering them as of now
7:)*
04well the thing is
04it uses external files for music
04so :/
7Remove it when you send it there? :P
04yeah that makes it look crappy
Pretty sure you can store the music files inside the fla.
Hi.
04What's a good compression format for audio that isn't slow but at the same time isn't crappy?
04um
.ogg?
;o
04you do know the external file loading is instantanious |D
04hm
04good idea
7MIDI. :3
When the file is local.
04lemme try that
/me 7flees.
04rofl
04yeah I know
/me starts making OOGs
MIDI FTW
/me 4hides
04hm
04prince-dari
04What compression should I use?
04MP3 makes it slow
04no I don't
;o
Silly OGG :P
/me 7finished another fakemon description.
04talking to Dari -.o
04*-.-
04um
Hmm.
04"ADPCM, MP3, Raw, speach"
04*Speech
;p
048bit, 16bit, 32bit, etx
04*etc
To be honest I don't know that much about music file types/compressions.
16 is decent
/me shot
04and apparently there's a 8kHz sample rate
Ns look at other chans.
SNEAS
That is...kinda terrible
04Should I do that?
04k
04:P
04erm
04that's an option for rate
I'd start with a lower quality version, then keep trying higher quality each time until you get a level of compromise.
04ugh
04yeah I know
04but
04eww
Start with 64KBPS, then go to 96 :P
0416bit converts to mono
04:c
Ew x.x
4*chirp*
04Flash CS5?
Maybe they use MIDIs :P
02aka: me
4And me
Hmm, seems the .ogg at 64KBPS is just a bit smaller than the MP3 @ 64 for a 2min song
http://kotaku.com/5811558/
But the MP3 is slightly louder
The drums are clearer XD
04gonna make them OOGs
04...Soundbooth doesn't convert to OOG.
And you can't import?
Or export, however you got the music into there
hello
04waitasec ideas
o.o
04I'm going to start at 112 kHz
04and go down until I hit crap
04and use the one before that |D
04btw
04prince-dari, is there a way for me to actionscript a sound to play?
04An embedded sound that is.
Yeah.
04|d
04*|D
/me waits for the great Prince's answer
/me shot
04ah
04nice
Then you'd load it with AS like this.
04k
whatever.play();
04so
i would like to learn how to streem
Then yeah, you place BGM.play(); where you want it to start.
04o_O
04so
04can I tell it WHEN to loop?
04Like, when it hits the end loop at *insert time*?
04or something
04|D
04Looping music is the least of my worries right now
You can do it inside.
04k
In properties, you can change the compression, default, ADPCM, MP3, raw, speech, and change the quality/bit rate.
04yes I know
oh well

oh really?
hmm
4!chatstats
mhm
I"m gonna try and collect them
I want the Snivy one
I haven't had a McDonalds burger in years
you could always just go in and buy the toys for a dollar if you don't wanna eat there, too
I haven't either
oh, I didn't know you could do that
yeah, most chain fast food places do
And 1:30am, nice :3
4Really? It's only 9:30 right now XD
I wish I would have known that back when I was trying to collect all the Finding Nemo toys
hahaha I have 8 million of those
Timezones are cool, and since I slept at 6-7pm :P
I think they're all in the hot tub room
pretty sure I got them all
I don't think I ever got that one

I don't remember the last kid's meal toys I collected were
I really liked the little beanie babies
Other than the Finding Nemo toys I don't remember any others I've collected
I still haven't seen that movie
Is it good?
D:
yes it's adorable
I turned off the song I have been looping for 3 hrs
I'll have to rent it whenever it comes out
yeah same here
It looks pretty good
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW PONIES
I signed up but I'm not playing much
I'm probably hurting my team more than helping, hah
same here
:P
which did you sign up for?
Tyrannia
We both did Tyrannia
oh
I picked maraqua
I think my sister is on Maraqua
Yeah, you just play the games
I think play the games is all
and whichever team racks up the most points from all the players wins that day

Oh and she's a "counsel member" in her guild or whatever
:P

I asked her if that was like a moderator and she said it basically doesn't do anything
I never really got the point in guilds....

Just like a group for friends I guess
I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THAT SONG
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I've been in a couple but never got into them because I never knew anyone
we should all make a guild
because your're obsessed with stupid creatures

YES
you still fail at hurting me
how do you make a guild anyway?
No idea
I guess we should find that out if we want to make one
found the page

:P
i Dare you
Or I'll kill Pinkie
Good
go and do those 'things'

I would make it but I only have 6 minutes left and I don't know if I can just quickly make it and edit it later
we can work on it tomorrow if we're all here

?
as in, pokemongen5.txt
my brain is fuzzling atm
I doubt $rand would work
You need to plug in limits
hmm, there might be something but it's gonna require something odd
wouldn't be too difficult if $rand could be used with binary, doubt that's possible though
could use $rand(1,3) and get it to substitute the numbers
but that's a very long system
and it's icky
would be awkward too
yeah
and let's avoid a goto ...
noooooooooo
don't want raptors attacking the bot's host machine
aaaah wait
if you can convert the list of allowed gens to their numbers
huh?
how to explain
er
have five variables, and if the gen that variable represents is disabled, set it to zero
this is damn difficult to figure out
hey
whats up?
I say do that, yes.
a shame $or only allows 2 chars
parameters*
nothing much
Try something else?
a pity, yes
I could possibly rescript the system
or I could do the long, boring and tedious way
and write up over 9000 if/elseifs
for every single combination
that would take a long time
yes it would
and slight correction, just have the variables equal to 1 if they're on, not equal to the gen
03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
(I'm still working on a method)
Hm, does isnum allow several parameters?
I only ever use if ($2 isnum) { or something
hmm, I'm not sure, I don't think it'll work though
Hm
this next bit is getting weird, store a temporary variable that is $calc( 2^1 ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 ( %gen5 ) ) ( obv fill in the ... with the other gens )
er,
$calc( 2^1 * ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 * ( %gen5 ) ) <-- remember to multiply
But I'm not too sure of any calculations
then, have a while statement of: while (%randresult !& %thattempvarwiththeweirdcalculation) {
Well, the easiest and probably simplest way would be using goto
and in there, %randres = $rand(1,5)
hm
then %randresult = $calc( 2 ^ %randres )
and that -should- do it, weird as it is
either unset %randresult or set it to zero after the while, or before it
04back
else it'll get stuck on a particular gen
04o-o
and yes, I know this is weird, but the & is the most useful statement here and all that's needed to get it into a form that it can be used for
heh, my brain hurts already
well actually, you could use lots of $biton and $bitoff statements, but I think that'd be even longer
I've never used those
:p be glad you didn't have to think the system up
and yeah, they don't look that useful
XD
I'm just like "wat"
also, set -uNUMBER is pretty damn useful
yep
...yeah, I suck at binary
and %randresult is doing the same conversion to that that I did with the gens
heh
while (%randresult !& %thattempvarwiththeweirdcalculation) <-- this is then seeing is %randresult matches any of the allowed gens, by seeing if any of the binary digits match
*if
hm
if they do match, the while's comparison = 0, and it then breaks out of the while loop
not exactly simple, but I blame mIRC for forcing either the long way, or the complicated way
mIRC isn't very flexible
well, from a set of variables stored in a file, at least
Actually, I think I might know a simpler system...to basically get mIRC to /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3 with blah being the numbers, then for it to do $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere)))
hmm
and then to select the character
is there a way to pick out the character like that?
never tried that sort of thing in mIRC
I remember there was one $ thing
/me checks
hm
(despite not looking like one that would do this)
though
how do you stop them from being included if they're not part?
(The numbers)
I'm pretty sure there is a way
I just can't remember it
because I've used it before
still have that script you used it in?
probably, but I'm not sure where I would have put it
and $mid would probably work
$mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1)
yes, that should work, if you can make the list properly
list?
%var
the string
or whatever, of the allowed gens
wb
that's easy
-> /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3
at least I think that works
if not then use an alias to handle it
well it's be 134
and then $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere))) would turn out $rand(1,3)
and then $mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1) would turn out as $mid(134,number,1)
but then you need a method of skipping the disallowed gens, which I would assume are set to zero
without that skipping you'd have 10340
well
Hmmm
onenote is pretty cool
basically it's a free-writing word thing
Hmmm.
you can type anywhere on it
without needing to hit enter etc.
er
shouldn't*
that's an ... unusual script.
xD
hmmm
just trying to decrypt it
oh wait
I think it'd be
hm
oh man, mIRC always makes things more complicated than they should be >:
I think while %gennum =< 5, but other than that ...
er sec
I'll paste you the script
alright
just look at the !setgen5 one
er
!setgen*
it's quite messy
lmfao we've been at this for an hour
I'm really not sure but I can't help but think $2 should be %gennumber in that script
or that part of it
actually
:p
yeah you're right, sorry, I thought you meant something else
XD
03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
lmfao
trust me, it's not the most confusing I've done
it's more messy than anything though
that's probably why it's confusing
like I said, python, sure, you can do all sorts of fun things with lists to make things like this easy
can't even get a proper list :/
I remember doing fibonacci numbers in python
I'll just read through this script to try understand what's happening
Back.
XD
wb
Thanks.
I think I wrote that script around 11-12 when I did
It could be a lot simpler and less messy but that requires effort
if ($2 isnum) && ($2 <= 5) && ($2 > 0) { <-- I think that might be possible to simplify to if ($2 isnum 1-5) {
not sure and something minor, but looks like it could
/me changes
thanks
np
Lol.
yeah, that's why I'm taking my time over it
XD
effort
$address($nick,2) FTW
but there's vhost issues and such
yeah
They don't change beyond a point.
eh I'd prefer nicks
it's easier to check and such
yeah
Meh, hostname is easier than that anyway.
of course, you can bypass vhosts using /userip
People don't change them that often.
Whatever you say. :P
there is nothing consistent day-to-dsay
there would be no way to track me
You could write a system to track hostnames/IPs to nicks.
a system which can use hostnames and nicks would be even more complex, by a large margin
It'd be pretty much the same as the system to track nick changes.
people usually switch at some point, and just one switch would get the connection listed
Nick-tracking could be done in only a couple lines though, and to make it work with hostnames all you'd have to do is store them when the nick-change script is used.
that would store hostnames, but the script to make use of stored hostnames would be far longer
I could make one just to prove a point.
making one and making one integrated with a script this complex isn't quite the same
I thought the script was pretty much just a $read with a couple of $readinis around it?
That's fairly simple to intergrate with.
if by a couple you mean 26 readinis, 10 writeini, and 8 reads, then sure.
plus all the conditions of selecting and handling those
I still think it wouldn't be that complicated, I'd rewrite the script to make it smaller.
you could, but the goal here is for full, flawless handling
I mean making sure it always functions as wanted
It would though.

An evil idea just wafted into my head
Oh really now?
?
-r
When reacting to their posts
Mainly because people post it everywhere.
/me hides
you're the exception
It would have a store of all the nick's you've used.
Hmmm?
the nick would have been seen with my old IP
Why not use NickServ?
Perfectly good solution there, not used
and how exactly do you link them using nickserv? last I looked nickserv doesn't tell you if two nicks are grouped
ergo, it should be able to make the connection
If the host changes, and the nick is unrelated then you have to assume it's a different person, otherwise all people would have one set of settings between them, because there is nothing else to distinguish between.
but the host for both nicks was the same before
Shouldn't the NickServ database have a list of grouped nicks?
Yeah, that would work.
I'd have an on *:JOIN: which checks the hostname to see if it has ever been used before and which nicks it should be linked with.
If*
I'll definitely give you that the script isn't as simple as I'd thought, but it's still not that bad.
I'd take that any day over some socket scripts. XD I'm not that great with them on mIRC.
sockets are a pain
12!espeon
/me still belongs to Global for 13 more minutes
which doesn't look to be possible
Each main nick would have 2 sections.
With related nicks stored in one, and related hostnames in the other.
I'd just have the sections as the mainnick $+ 1 and mainnick $+ 2 with hostnames in one and nicks in the other.
and you'd have to do it every time a nick or host appears, for every nick that isn't one of the main ones
I'd have a store of nicks/hostnames currently on the channel.
And which main nick they're related to.
I decided that any nicks that are used more than once just have the default settings with scripts.
Otherwise unregeistered nicks would cause problems.
More than once by unlinked main nicks I mean.
Yeah, I suppose.
fair enough, though that does then defeat the object of having all nicks used by a given person connected
Hmmm
Think GLIST and INFO might be fo help
*of
Hmmm
-NickServ- Access denied.
Info doesn't seem to show alternate nicks as well
Do they have access to this information?
Why?
in case an exploit appears and someone makes use of it before it's removed
It tells you whether a nick is registered or not, which is helpful.
that is helpful, yes
could make it connect across registered nicks
Still doesn't solve some things though.
$crlf is the most problematic exploit that could appear, and in fact has (though has not yet been taken advantage of)
hrm
!tstposts
!pony $ip
!pony $crlf
Hmmm
I doubt it.
that would be possible, but require more and be extremely risky
a raw dump of the database, certainly, is a terrible idea
hmmm
As long as the passwords are stripped before dumping, I see not much risk
oh?
I don't know if it'd be of any help, it says it can though.

or hrm, maybe
and, like we've agreed now I think, not really worth the effort
I think the current system works fine, if people are that desperate to disable a gen, they can do it for their common nicknames
Yeah, I wasn't intending to switch to hostnames anyway
the system we were discussing was slightly more complex than that and would work fairly nicely ignoring bugs, but would be too complex to be worthwhile
yep
/me continues scripting
argh crap
I don't think that works because vars don't work inside the brackets
hrm
I know I've done something like that before
I'm pretty sure that works, unless the [] stuffs it up

I wanted to kill myself.

I had that with one of my other scripts

Okay, I think I have it done
just adding a safeguard in case someone disables everything
because if they do the script dies
ahyeah, heh
Alright, just let me split my pokemon.txt

okay, separated the files

03I like just about any type of music except country
12I think this is my last name change
/me hides
/me has changed his name
13songs > genres
Agreed AE
13I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3
but Rap does suck in every possible way
/me runs
10Just wondering
03nah, there are plenty of good rap songms
10[15:48] <Angel_Espeon> I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3 <- Exact opposite, my problem is I have too many favourite songs x.x
03go listen to Changes by 2pac
Non-rap > Rap
;>
Opera Rap > Everything
03but that's mostly Dr. Dre
03D
03*XD
13I don't even have favourite songs, just some songs that I happen to listen to more than others
10HML, wat.
10[15:49] <HyperMetalLugia> Non-rap > Rap
10?
You read it right lols :p
Rap crap
XD
12lol
/me runs
06[15:48] <Angel_Espeon> I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3 <-- This.
10Rock/metal and hip-hop are probably my favourite

10Overused memes are overused, also.
06I don't care that people are fans. I couldn't care less. The only "violation" I've personally seen them doing is generally assuming that EVERYONE cares about all their thousands of pony images and seem surprised when people really do not care :P

4Night!
night angel
4alright
8but i just told him whenever he can is fine
7Bah, was going to say my good-night to her.
6but there was nopony else here...
8oh yeah
8DCD told me he was gonna drop by to train one of us on streaming
4What was the site to see how you're upload speed is?
6With no instructions as to whom?
4Or fast he goes?
8http://www.speedtest.net/
http://i.imgur.com/CVmef.png
6*decides to test*
XDDD
/me 8has an upload speed of 6.58
brb food
6lol 7.95
8well shit man
4Bah, my upload speed is still 0.36 mbps -_-
8you should be streaming
6I probably could, if I had any idea as to how.
4Doesn't he need a webcam?'
6A webcam? To stream? That would be... bullshit.
8i dont think u need a webcam
8im not sure why you would
6I don't see why you would...
8lol
4*shrugs*
8DCD said he isnt going to do that outside of post show anymore
6Thank Celestia.
WOAH! I'm back.
6After that, no.
;o
11Colour
11I saw that. Awesome. :D
!chatstats
11So, what's the news on the streaming?
8well
6 7.95 mbps upload.
6I could, if I was shown how before hand.
4!chatstats
This script can only be used once every 5 minutes!
6Also, would mean the stream would go on a LOT longer.
4SCRIPTBOT
4Sprinkles would be streaming shit ALL THE TIME
8imokaywiththis.jpg
7But if you're curious:
6I have very little to show...
6I could do that.
4^ Wow
8sprinkles, download some arrested development
12bbl, restart
6I have... xxxHolic. XD
wut
8true
8also, the style just feel sweird
6...lol
4It just felt like less than five minutes that's all
4Silver, I know of a series
And that was 2 minutes lol
6Whoo!
11Oh?
8DCD can't make it
4Cromarti High School
1 minute and 20 seconds exactly
11I'll look that up.
6DCD and his tests...
11That's been jumping around, hence all the changes to streaming we've been discussing.
8lol
11Testception.
8btw, just posted flutewood in a thread on /oat/
11BWOOOOOOOOM!!!!
11Nice.
6I've been posting flutewood a lot lately...
6That and: SPRINKLEBERG
8i fluterolled a mod today
8i was proud
6Nice.
make fun of band name have band of that name retweet it LOL OOPS
11Fluterolled? XD
4Clint Flutewood
8spoilered pic of a flute
4The man with no flute
11Nice.
11Alright, now I want to bring something to everyone's attention.
11We have some official competition.
8go on...
8is that arcesious?
4right?
11Yes. It's in the MOvie Discussion thread.
8ok
11They're called the Symphonic Ponies movie night group.
8anyway, continue
11Aparently they stream 24/7.
8not really movie night then lol
11er, correction. Every night.
6Where's their stream?
8ok
8got it
4I wouldn't say this is exactly bad unless we start losing viewers
8ok, found the stream
8i dont think we have anything to worry about
8they have 4 people there
6...XD
6link?
8it peeves me a little that they copied our exact layout though
8http://symphonicmatrix.org/stream/
4We should raid
4lol
6...I've got a web block on it.
6Their site isn't rated, ours is.
4Silver I was just kidding
8anyway
8it doesnt seem like a huge deal
4It's not, we're more organized than they are
4We're "ahead of the curve" I suppose
6That's got to be taxing.
11OH! I just thought of something.
11Er, not just now, but it's something that Arc's critique got me to think of.
11....that's fucking genius.
4Dude
4Sprinkles
8that would be awesome
4Or something
6justthatawesome.gif
8we would need mods from europe though
4everyone is gone
11How did we NOT come up with that?
6Yeah.
8unless you and dari can handle it alone
4!Pokemon'
4!Pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 8Sunkern.
11What time would this occur?
lol
8how about saturday afternoon?
:<
SHame
4I tend to bring disaster a lot
6I was thinking 2 PM EST
11Afternoon...that would be a more reasonable time...
6Which would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
11Hell, both Euro AND Ameribronies can watch then.
Do you know where Stormy's at?
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
I've been trying to talk to her on gmail and she hasn't been replying
no
...in fact I didn't even realize she left
o___o;
8i like it
well her neo's been on for like 2 hours I think she just left her computer on
04ROARA hi :D
4I like it too
Did someone say my name?
4Man
4Dari
yeah, but it doesn't even show her as away on gmail
11Hi, Dari.
Hey.
6Wow.
8dari, we had an idea
11Sprinkles just gave us our revelation.
04same
04x-x
I had 4 hours of sleep
as per usual
Ok, let's hear it. :o
wel
like she did with SR
I had 8 hours
but
;D
:P
haha
8sprinkles said he can stream the movies again on saturday afternoon our time
._.
11Saturday Afternoon Movies.
8so it would be night for those in europe
!setgen status
1st Gen: on Â· 2nd Gen: on Â· 3rd Gen: on Â· 4th Gen: on Â· 5th Gen: off
6So it would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
4Sprinkles pretty much just gave us an awesome idea
11So that the Eurobronies can have a Saturday Movie Night
Oh, that's awesome.
why 5th gen off lol
4Or if they want to see it again
It's per-nick based
I hate 5th gen
this is an updated version of the !setgen5 script
4But this is great, this solves one of our biggest issues
I'm GMT.
6It's 11:30?
Basically does all generations now
12:30
6!pokemon
6Okay.
6Google lied to me.

4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXm1ICO8Nec
6But yeah, 2 PM EST would be 7 PM GMT.
6All is well.
8ok, here is one potential problem
8when do we do the lottery?
4Hmm
6After the saturday.
11Both.
6It's early enough for both parties.
11We switch it back and forth
6I like Silver's idea too.
8you mean alternate weeks?
6Friday one week, Saturday the next.
11Exactly.
8i would be fine with that
11Then we let the Saturday group choose the next week.
8eliminates any possible bias
11Same results, nopony's left out.
4Oh
11and yeah, no biase.
4So which day are we choosing this week?
6I like this plan. I'm glad to be a part of it.
hey
hi
hi
6He put another in?
6I must not have seen.
11I like this plan, ANOTHER! *smashes fist into the screen*
11He made a smartass comment about me doing Random MOvie Trivia.
6Oh. He's really getting to be a pain.
8i actually talked to turnibrony in a different thread, he seemed more chill than usual
4Bah, let him bark
6Yeah, I see the post now.
11I ignored it.
11Guy's a Waste of energy.
8i didnt really take it that way
8it seemed like he was just sad he missed it
11Yeah, it's hard to read meaning behind text.
6...my comp's upload speed apparently got higher.
11Figures.
6By .25 mbps
11awesome.
8and he said he's planning on coming this week and likes our movie selection
11Sweet.
11Oh, and I get to use this week's movie as an opportunity to get some Jaffar pics. :D
6lawl
8nice
8also
11hmm?
6>probably
4Aladdin?
4Really?
6I believe you mean definately.
8i like to not assume the worst

6We'll be looking for more Euro-mods though.
11Idealy, but not required, IMO
4Alright
11Alright, now that we got all of that out of the way, I'd like to promote my idea.

11Rarity Sauce is.
6All of us.
11Again.
congratulations everybody!
4Even you
OH SHIT
8about the saturday stream
6...
8oh boy
6Mom, I am disappoint.
she pretty much gave me a SON I AM DISSAPOINT speech but she was just worried about me being gay I guess
I'm not and I told her, maybe I convinced her, maybe not
8i came dangerously close to saying "everypony" during camp today
6You should show her BMN! XD
My parent's wouldn't care, but they'd make fun of me for at least a month.
6I said everypony in the middle of Hershey Park. REALLY LOUD.
8...society, i am disappoint
11My parent's wouldn't give a damn, though my dad's suspicions of my sexual preference would come up again. *rolls eyes*
8nope.avi
in any case
11I was busy in /rp/ again.
8indeed
6:D
4Yes
lemme see if I can ask Astray to train you
6YESSIR
6*retests*
1.99 Mbps
O_o
Really?
8oh, and we're talking about doing the selection lottery alternating weeks
speed is not exactly an issue
Wow.
BUT
6LOL 8.97 MBPS
you can't go overboard with quality
because if you do
4Jesus
4 8.97
Are you guys talking DL or UPL?
oh right
8UPL
8right?
6UPL
0.96?
in any case
6My DL is 12 MBPS
even if you have a huge UL
4Wow
4Sprinkles
using it would basically kill viewership
8yeah
slideshow
6I don't plan on using it like crazy.
564 Kbps seems like the best course of action
no no
4!pokemon
11He's saying don't stream at highest quality
Hooh54, you are a 10Alomomola.
I'm saying that you should all get trainin' in the stream sort of things
6High upload would allow me to easily stream while doing other things.
that too
11And that. Get trained.
4Alright
yeah
pretty much
which is a great idea
4I'd like to bring something else up at some point tonight
4But we can finish this first
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 12Teddiursa.
bring it up while I get Astray
since I have to go back to work and all

7z files ARE real
:P
6It's AT&T here.
XD
they're basically the spealization of 7Zip
*specialization
just extract it
4...Hmm
4What do you guys think?
4I'm cool with it, I guess
11It's the same as having several rooms of a theater.
it brings too many problems
11it does?
6It would be way too complicated.
yes, the fact that you'd have to moderate two rooms simultaneously
8extraction inside an extraction
it simply isn't viable, and would result more difficult
6People going "I WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS THIS PONY" too.
however, I'd like to know something
11Point.
we could limit each person typing to a 15-second interval
4Isn't there a way to limit how fast people respond?
6Of course right after Dari left...
8damn, we should have asked dari while he was here
4A script, possibly?
other than that, no clue
4DARIIIIIIIIIIIIII
8omg
6HIPSTER GET OUT OF MY HEAD
4*weeps*
6MAGIC
8for realz
11ponyshrug.jpg
6In ten seconds flat.
11oh.
11lol
11Damn Magnet, how does he work?
6But dari, do you know how to set a time in between letting people post?
8it jumped me to like 4 different spam sites
http://i.imgur.com/OTZur.png
I want to do this at a sporting even now
XD
8heres the problem with that
11damn.
8oh
8my
8goooooooooooooooooood
11we don't want to kick people just because they talk too much
4Damn, I do that for emphasis -_-
8if you break them up like that for comedic effect, you could end up getting kicked
since their job is to talk and all
8but still
11It would still effect viewers
Though I don't see how that'd help, because people spam loads after +m has been set.
http://pokedamos.deviantart.com/art/Lugia-and-I-part-1-comic-213193181
11Yeah, because then the spam goes FUCKING NUTS when the +m is lifted.
I hope its not too bad
6Hey.
I'm here
10Nice
8hey astray
11If we had more mods, we could split into only two rooms.
Wow
6HI!
O,o
6Me.
8sprinkles
and?
11But I don't think we're at that level just yet.
11Sprinkles.
oh
I need to pratice more
it sucks
I'll see if there's anything I can do other than setting up an IRC server.
Though I can do that if needed.
11If that's the case, then we might as well do the whole Pony Server thing as we planned. :/
11: /
/me 5rolls around
what's the progress with the Notifications-to-Viewers system?
maybe that would get you on TV
8are you talking about the listserv?
11Damn. I completely forgot about that.
6Working on it now, Astray.
D:
in that case maybe not
4I hai
4*Oh
10Damos, no way, it's really good
5Hey~ 8D
8no movement on it yet that i know of
http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1308086721797.gif
DEM TITS
11#Training
4all I see is a picture of 4chan.org
4I agree :3
but its not straoght
straight*
hey Roly Poly Chan
5:|
5Lol hi.
4Does it have to do with their streaming capabilities?
10Use a ruler next time?
How does that sound?
10Either way, I don't think it really needs to be any straighter o.o
4What about me ._.
11Prince-dari: Now there's an idea.
6Then we'd have to unvoice EVERYBODY and revoice them during/after the lotto.
11Ghosties: Are you training to be a streamer?
As I said.
well only that closeup tall building is mess up
4Well, for one, my UPL is complete shit
6That would work, then.
I thought I had it straight but I didn't
oh well
4So I couldn't stream if I wanted to
11So it's a no.
I'll do it when I have time, how long should people lose their voice for, and how many message would they have to say in how long?
thanks
Normally about 6 messages in 8 seconds warrants a kick on IRC.
10You're welcome
/me 7simmers metaphorically.
8sounds good to me
11Shorten it to 5 for 5 and I think we have a good setup.
hey drfinator
6...hmm...I apparently have run out of food...
hey Quany CHan
Fine, I'll do it when I have time, but now I REALLY have to go.
5Hey Quan, hey DRF. :3
6k
11goodnight, Dari
4See ya dari
11Sleep well.
4Yo Quan
8see ya dari
6You've got all week, no rush. XD
6G'night.
Thanks, cya.
03httttttttttttttt

8lol, i got lunch at chipotle today on the football team's expense account
6I have NO food, silly.
8it was glorious
okay
11You should get some Ramen. :P
6I got baked on the expense of a nearby township. XD
we need tits.
11No, we don't.
4What?
8plenty of time for that later
4I return to "we need tits"
5o-o
/me 11will begin working on "IT'S PONY NIGHT!!!" tomorrow. :D
><Astray>: we need tits. <Silverscreen>: No, we don't.
I agree
HOW CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN?
11Easy, I have a cock. :P
trannies have cocks too
:3c
and faggots
4What are you implying Astray?
I'm implying nothing
11Ow.
I'm merely stating that having a penis does not make you a man
4Well
11....
4Biologically, it does
11abandonchat.gif!!!!
11....wow, that actually worked. >.>
4IT SURE IS QUIET IN HERE
biologically it makes you a male
I think he meant "we need to see some tits"
not a man.
/goes back to work
EW THAT FACE
Ew this ...text
Rebelling needs to be done
;P
7Yeah, if I could care less about emotions (read, literally, and not the misinterpreted version of).
8awesome
/me puts on headphones and plays some music
4Sweet man
4DAT PLUG
!sneas
4I'll brb guys
11k
Blue deer do not exist...what
7tl;dr.
Well most parents are silly and don't know a thing :P
11I understood.
Or are just crazy, those are dangerous
8listserv
/me 7is too nice for actual action. o.O
11I thought we pretty much agreed that we just need ARGH to tell us how to work it?
I just go verbal or do the exact opposite :P
8do you want to run point on that?
11Which reminds me, I haven't seen a daily /oat/ in a while.
7I suppose, but it's not like you can actually change anything. v.v
11You mean do I want to go through with it?
Patience changes everything eventually
7Yes, yes...
8can you talk to him about it
8?
7A year or two of high school left.
4There's one other thing I wanted to talk about, but you guys go ahead
11All I gotta do is wait for the next Daily /oat/ thread and I can bring it up with him in there.
11Can do.
http://i.imgur.com/0WuTI.png
11We covered just about everything else.
8i guess you can email him or post it in the /collab/ thread
11there's that too...it's been inactive otherwise.
Hey everyone :)
Guesstimation or truth?
:P
8im for it
7Whaddya think?
Truth?
8i would be surprised if it isnt unanimous
haha
You seem uncertain about it
:3
/me 7tilts a paw on the horizontal axis.
7(Perpendicular to the ground, of course.)
4And I want to bang the fuck out of Ellen Page
4But this is more realistic
Er, why not cardinal?
4Rebecca Black's 13, man
4I think
8too bad shes annoying as shit and way, way underage
7Relative.
Add some compass points and a tangent?
8and not particularly attractive
:D
4Is everybody else being trained right now?
11I'm not
I'd explain, Astray
but I don't know shit about her
cause I don't give a shit about her
their arguments:
she's 13
11...
and annoying as fuck
8"she's 13" /conversation
11Underage.
11End of conversation.
oh
OH
you guys gotta know
It's Astray
:3c
I ain't gonna explain shit
/thread
4She's underage mang

Age of Consent = 14

4Astray likes her
8astray brought it up
4Apparently
4Or something
10Seeya
11Astray's talking about wanting to bang her and somehow that led into the subject of age-of-consent. A subject that I'd like to drop now.
8good idea
6I agree.
4Silver
11Ghosties
11I'm good for it.

4I think yeah
4He did

nighto
6The stuttering is only because I have to use VAC.
I'd say
6It's the very best I can get.
most definitely serviceable
6G'night Astray.
6AWESOME.
6video or audio quality?
as in, 500 Kbps Vid/ 64 Kbps Audio
6Just a sec.
6The vid is at that, the audio isn't.
6Restarting.
6Good?
play again
I'd say it runs well in this end
we'd have to ask other viewers
6Awesome.
6Yeah.
12mapquest on shortest distance
but it's serviceable
6It is due to the vid.
4I did
6We want to see how it's working.
6Awesome.
4It's kinda low quality, but otherwise it runs fine
6This YTP is just low quality in itself.
6Lemme try something that's higher quality.
4Alright
6Switching.
6Look good?
4I can't hear anything : /
4Oh
4Hello guys
4Nevermind
4my volume was low
6LULZ
6Is the vid good?
4The only thing is that it looks kinda lower quality
4Hmm
4It looks...fuzzy
Good evening everyone.
6Hmm... that's odd.
4But again, otherwise, this is great. At least it runs fine
6Easily.
okay, that seems to clinch it
6The last one was a poor quality vid.
now we should deal with the last two things we're missing
that's even in mine
I believe it's due to the size of
Sprinkles' selected area being smaller
ergo, next time, try making it a bit bigger
yeah most definitely the fact it's zoomed in
6?
6Yep.
4Sprinkles you chose this ep right?
6Or not. Oo
6lol
6One sec, the resolution reset itself somehow.
in any case
we should get working on two things
4You never got that Applebloom trip, did you XD
6No, I did not.
first, getting someone that can useBronyState to stream the S2 episodes live as they air on the Hub
second, the whole "BronyState Viewer Notification System"
4Viewer Notification System?
6The listserv
6Restarted
I kind of meant
a sort of
6Video still good?
change it back
6XD
cause it's stuttering like shit now
or just lower it a bit
6This good?
be notified of out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
6>out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
6You mean whenever I'm on near every night?
6Okay, fixing.
I just meant some sort of...dunno, like those news twitters keeping people updated with news about the subject at hand
are not from Ponychan
6I like this idea.
basically
a news feed
4Back
maybe we should do like The Daily /oat/
and make an e-mail as well
kind of a newsletter
03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
I'm heavily uninclined for "Twitter"
As I dislike Twitter
and not everybody has Twitter
4Hello?
6I. Dislike. Twitter.
that said we could probably make a RD-Network group for the BMN
and post updates there as well
4But having something for Twitter would give us more exposure
e-mail Newsletter, RD-Network Group, Twitter Account
6running again
those three might be
obligatory
any other ideas
?
4...facebook?
smooth
6DCD, is it good again?
albeit much lower quality than before
it had a bit more higher quality earlier
4Why can't I hear anything?
6It should be the same quality as when it was running smoothly before.
4And my volume is high
well it wasn't looking fuzzy for me before
and now it does
6I stopped it.
4That was much fuzzier : /
6Should be good now.
6Forgot to fix something.
6>>; Had to reopen the program 'cause it froze and forgot to fix things.
6It good?
4Fuzzy, and I can't hear anything
6DCD, you have audio?
6Hm...
4Ohai
4It was quiet here
6Good now?
4Yeah, I can hear now
6Alright, brb
4Alright
6Have to go afk
4Okay
E-Mail/Rainbow Dash Network Group/Twitter
I was also thinking on adding a news tracker bar
to this page
4A news tracker?
4How would that work?
more like a ticker
I just want some sort of news update here
4Well, I mean, we do set the topic message to display what's currently going on manually
4But do you mean you want something that's always visible?
well, maybe that's not a good idea
we still need more ways to notify the subscribers
also DAMMIT APPLEJACK
6back
also I hear no audio either nwo
you might need to bump it up
4I hear audio
6It's low... apparently.
4It's not very loud though
6Working on it.
6How about now?
570+ pony pictures
6Silly fillys that totally weren't directly next to eachother in Ep. 1 or anything...
4Shhh
4Don't talk about that
4The creators didn't want you to know
anyway
bbl soonish
4Woah
4It's lagging
6It's my comp. I just opened like, four things.
4!eXAKR
/me now belongs to Hooh54 for 14 minutes
4Ah
6WOW SUDDENLY HUGE
4THIS EPISODE'S ABOUT RELIGION
6IT IS.
4THEREFORE, I HATE IT
6Got sound?
4Yes, I have sound
bbl restarting computer and getting food for myself
also shower
4No, but seriously, I don't get how people can say the ep's about religion
6LOL EP SWITCH
6It's not really.
6It can be applied, but really shouldn't be.
4NAHHHHHHHHHHH
6It... really is.
4That's too farfetched
6NAAAAAH
4IT'S ABOUT RELIGION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4Bleh, some people
but yeah
/me hides
I'd say that you should just deal with Audio
in any case
I can probably point you in the right direction
6Probably should now.
6Also, fark, how have I not yet finished dloading all the pony eps? Oo
6Nope.
4*nods*
6?
6Nope.
it might just be out of view
if you're in Vista or 7
6I probably do.
6I'm in Vista.
go to "Recording Devices"
6k
and select "show disabled"
enable it, lower its volume
and use it as the Audio Capture Device in FME
it should also help with the suttering
well
seems VAC's the only option
you might have to tweak around with it
>:c
6I have been.
4!Chimera
6It was the mane problem in the first place... >>;
4You belong to ME
4Or not
12D:
12noooooooooooo
Yessssssssssssss
12LugiaLordOfTheSeas
12laugh at me all you want
OK :3
12but i just got the gender change journal entry XD
12on mabi
Good for you
gotta go
night
6ty
6Indeed.
4Oh my
6So when he can I'd prefer him to.
6But when he goes for the night I'd be glad to take over.
4I agree
4But man, you saved our butts
6justthatawesome.gif
4You solved a massive problem we were having with getting the stream out to the Euro guys
6I CAN COUNT TO BOOKS
4MAYBE
4The other neat side effect is that we have something to watch now XD
6I know. XD
4Stop clopping to ponies, haha
4And it's about "stop clopping"
6Hello Glass_Arm
Hi!
4Wait
4wait
4wait
6XD
No you are not
4Sprinkles, would you like to do the honor?
4I didn't mean kick me asshole
6XD
4Yeah
12o-o
4I don't
Night probably.
03:<
:<
6It's 'cause I was on fb
6Better now?
4Yeah, but still split second lags
6No movie tonight.
4Not tonight, Glass_Arm
Oh
6I have /oat/ open.
6fbook lags my comp like crazy.
fuck FB
stare at flanks
FlankBook
Repost then
6It was just that fbook normally lags my comp at least a little.
4What the
4Huh
4Oh
6I had to check on something important.
4 /oat/ is the random board on Ponychan
4Don't care
Oh
heh
4Did you download all the eps, Sprinks?
must also be the furry board
6All up to a certain point.
6I dloaded most of them one day and then got lazy.
6I think the latest I have is E16.
I need to download eps
4How does the vid look, Glass_Arm?
Which vid?
4The one now
wat
4?
I am totally lost
6He's on his phone.
I'm on my mobile
4Oh right
Sorry :/
4 /oat/ is the furry board? Well, there was that Rule 63 thread of Spike the other night
4And everybody and their mothers whined about it
6Oo Wut?
/me doesn't bother to look up the rule
6Wut ARE you talking about?
6 63: There is furry porn about it. No exceptions.
4Rule 63 means "for every male character there is a female equivalent"
6...
Oh
6Darn.
6I was wrong.
That would be awesome actually
4It can be awesome
6*cough4chancough*
^
4I'm sure 4chan loves it
6Oo How do -I- not have Show Stoppers?
6Apple Bloom is awesome.
6Deal with it.
4Alright
6Though I have no idea where to get the movies.
4We can probably have a meeting tomorrow to discuss that
6Yeah.
6So am I.
6:D
4I was pushing for it when you were made halfop
6I know, I was there.
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
I am the next half-op
hurr
4Hmmm
jk
4*taps chin*
I haven't been here for movie night yet, even
*okay*
4Yes, I meant to use repetition :)
4Or did I?
4Fuck, I don't know
4In any case, you should come to the BMN
Ok
I need to make time
4Well, we have good news for you
:O
6There's going to be a second showing from now on!
4Yep
4Saturday at 2 PM EST
6Starting at 2 PM EST on Saturday.
:D
Oh
4Where their time is about five hours ahead of the U.S.
/me 4honestly had no idea to respond to that >_<
4Love and Tolerance is a purely subjective mantra that is left up to the discretion of the individual
:(
6Also, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself.
4Whatever the fuck that means
No paradoxes pls
6lol
6Silly cat lady
03*WB02(Ripred02)03WB* - <Ripred> 04google is for noobs
4In any case, you're gonna find people that are Fluttershies or whatever, and Gildas like me
6And Pinkies like me.
6=P
4Yes
I must be the Twilight
lol
;p
bbl
bbl
4Are you a bookworm?
I read a lot
spend a lot of time
antisocial
yup
4*nods* Yeah, you'd be a twilight
And I practice magic
with magnets
very key
4So I bet you felt that Feeling Pinkie Keen was about religion, don't you?
6Not just religion.
That fits as well
4WAIT
4NO
4Swarm of the Century
6lulz
4ruining everything
4Huh, Glass_Arm left
6Well, it's not like he could see the vid.
4*nods*
4Sprinks, do you that I'm dominating?
4*think that
6Not really.
03we're all avoiding you
6I tend to act very... jokingly.
4:(
4You do NOT mess with Fluttershy
4Yes, you are definitely that pony on screen
4Not that one
6XD
4That one
4Now pinkie is declining
4Trumbone
6Say when Rainbow Dash talks.
4leaves
4She's talking
6Wow.
4This is normal though
6So far back.
4Don't worry about it
6XD
4DCD mentions how the streamer sees ahead of everyone else
4Welcome newcomer
6Ah.
6XD
4Are you downloading?
6I am.
4Yeah
6brb
4Alright
4Well...fuck

4Yep
4Stupid Twilight
6lol Pinkie
6PINKLEBERG
4Goodnight :3
4I can't believe it was Tara Strong
6TARA STRONG IS EVERYWHERE.
4Yes she is
4Every fucking where
4Pinkie Pie
4Strutting like a boss
6THREAD EVACUATION IN PROGRESS
6Fillydelphia. XD
4Manehatten
6Yep.
4Hah, saved it
4Good job
4Next, dear Sprinks?
4Oh ho ho, Boast Busters
/me falls asleep
12yay
/me zzzz
4Really o.o
6XD
4I remember the infamous menstruating thread
4Was that the thread?
6It wasn't.
4Ah
4Dude
6Yeah, it was messed up.
4I think Rarity is probably my least favorite main pony
6I know. XD
6Not at all.
6The quality on my end is 720p.
4Weird
6It's the laptop.
6But still, something is something.
4Indeed
6It also probably doesn't help that this laptop is 3 years old.
4Well, yeah, there's that too
4She may as well be the very best in Equestria, next to Celestia and Luna
4Where?
6Twilight.
6She is a Mary Sue.
6Meh.
6But I'm sure if she was put on a Mary Sue litmus, she'd at least get Uber-Sue.
4Meh, I guess
6But, meh.
6I get Uber-Sue on most litmus tests.
6XD
4litmus?
6Mary Sue litmus tests.
6They're usually quite stupid.
4You like the CMC, don't you?
6I like Apple Bloom.
4*nods*
6Practically.
/me roars
6ADVENTURE
6I know. XD
6Watch it for the plot.
4Wow
4That full grown pony had the cry of an infant
4How bizarre
:D
<e
<3
lol
6It is.
6Twilight.
6Friends with EVERYPONY.
4Does that make her more of a Mary Sue?
6Gog. It's such a pain to have half my screen taken up.
4Just stop streaming man, no one's here right now and no one expects you to stream
6Nope.
4*sigh* Alright man
6It gives me a reason to watch ponies.
6I'd have my screen taken up by it anyway. XD
4Hah, right
hi
how's it going?
not much right now
just updating the PS3 and writing a dA journal
6Nope.
cool
6Also, that's how one pony is already on ponychan.
:D
Oh good.
6PEACHY PIE
My bamboo have problems
Oh yeah
*Bamboo Tablet

4Hmm, I see
4Oh well

4In ancient times
4Hundreds of years before the dawn of time
and
ghurogdhr
4Lived a strange race of people, the druids
IT WAS WORTH IT
XD
6I always picture "Bohemian Rhapsody" to this part of the ep.
all the things I just mentioned
4I think of Spinal Tap's "Stonehenge"
oh haha
I missed that post
my bad
:P
was that today we were talking about that restauraunt?
it feels like it was longer ago than that
like it was yesterday
haha, it was today
my memory sucks
:P
6Nevermind.
6I finally got a decent look at their cutiemarks.
Let's just say he won't be... living anymore.
6I did not see that.
4Or a pony that had the model of Pinkie, I mean
4Show it next, and I'll show you the pony

6It's only 10-20 min to download each ep.
4Right

I swear everyone finds it scary, but I think it's adorable

4*GASP*
6I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING
4I AM CRYING TEARS
6MANLY TEARS
6It's really awesome. XD
4And I think Luna is also voiced by Tabitha St. Germain
6Lulz
4Haha, I thought Pinkie was gonna burst out laughing during the sappy moment between Celestia and Luna
4When she does that "PFFTTTT"
6I know. XD
4I'll show you Pinkie's recolor
6Just finished downloading.
4Nice
4Would you buy a DVD of Season 1 FiM?
6At this point, likely not.
6I already have a way to have all the eps.
hello
6So unless it had something AWESOME that came with it.
2Hello to you too. :3
6But I am biased by being broke.
hello to MYSELF.
6;-;
4Right, well, you might wanna do that tomorrow evening
6Of course.
Awwww, can I ask?
6Silly Mexicans, not knowing how to clean floors. XD
http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/Together.png >>> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgozdfeNhA1qh979ko1_500.jpg
hope I get something good
like the avvvv
me too actually
Spot the goofs in the second picture
or a paint brush or something
XD
6I'm watching the floor cleaners that come in once a month.
I never get anything good out of it
but I'm always hoping
XD
6I'm not, I'm actually staying out of their way.
4*nods*
4You should help them then
Eeep
Stay away from that PokÃ©mon episode
You know
That one with flashing lights
Wait
2The one called "Electric Soldier Porygon"?
Just stay away from flashing lights, K?
Yes
4She has it again in the ep with Photo Finish
4And she actually does look like an emo
6Yeah, in the one image.
2Movies and Animal Planet as well as playing Suikoden.
4Angel <3
4Aw yeah, here we go
4It's coming up
4Alright, now, in the flashback sequence for Rarity watch out for a blue pony with curly hair
4Here
mine should be at least close to done
how long has it been going
I suppose it sometimes takes three
6Had to rewind because of the fact that I'm ahead.
4That's fine
4Watch out for her
one time it took literally like
5 hours
D:
6I see her.
6lol Bluie Pie
if it takes tooi much longer I'm just gonna leave it running as I sleep
:P
4She really does kinda look like Pinkie
XD
6lulz
but dangit I want to see it finish
:P
6Proof that Pinkie's story is a lie?
6WHAT?
6Yeah.
4She looks like a previous gen Twilight
6Yep.
4He appears in present time too
6Where?
4Coming up, after Twi's flashback
4In fact, he's there standing next to her
6Speaking of cacti.
4Haha
2Not really. Only a few episodes of Inuyasha and Wolf's Rain.
4Banished
6LOL THERE HE IS
4Yep
/me 2hums Team Plasma's battle theme
4WITH THE EXACT SAME APPEARANCE FROM THE PAST
4He never aged
4ever
4Him and Derpy literally are time travellers
4Since there's this debate on whether or not it actually is her sister from Best Night Ever
6I doubt it.
6Coat color and mane color are both different.
4People speculate that hair changes color over time
4AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
4The fuck Pinkie Pie
4Seriously
4Haha, I can try. I'm a writer, but I don't want to fuck anything up XD
I'm crying http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJo-Dnrv5pU
4DERP DASH INCOMING
my speakers aren't working D:
they stop working sometimes
good
XD
the sound
is
6The alt endings to this ep?
4Yes
they stop working sometimes and restarting is the only way to get them working again
oh good
I am glad they aren't working then
4I would actually really like to see RD on an adventure into the woods to fight some monster
4FUCK MORALS
even the visuals are creeping me out
XD
4*PUNCHES THE WALL*
oh hey the wheel stopped
I got some weird food
what'd you get
D:
4Okay
Evil Blancmage
4Well
*Blancmange
6I'm going soon too.
6I just need to at least finish this download.
2Well that sucks. O_o
But Black/White is still awesome
I feel like going on a pop music binge
hah
do it
I dare you
:P
perhaps
o
:P
and Washington was labelled "Hipsters"
YUP
most the hipsters here reside in capitol hill
6Or not.
6Apparently I have to wait an hour before downloading again.
oh that reminds me
4FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
you know that venue I was trying to find
6Silly MegaUpload.
yeah
it was like
an old basement
4I think you should just go home after Winter finally Wraps up
O.o
6Sounds like a plan to me.
4And continue downloading tomorrow
it was awesome
there were lights hanging down from the ceiling with half of the light bulbs out
That's crazy
4Yep
haha
and I balanced on a sofa and a mattress to see
XD
4There's an official Keanu Reeves and Agent Smith on Ponychan
4Fuck yes
it was like a house
6I approve of this.
4I definitely approve
12Hey IcyNinetales
IT WAS COOL THOUGH omg
2Hi! *waves*
Hahaha
6Hopefully...
and when people were crowdsurfing they were swinging the lightbulbs around
/me waves back :3
let me restart first
6Yep.
/me 2is currently playing Suikoden
to get my sound working again
oh ok you don't need sound though lol
6I. Know.
oh
6I'm weirded out by this.
like just to see the lights swinging around
4Streaming to possibly over 200 people
well, I feel like listening anyway
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:04
alright :P
brb
6This is why I'm setting up a playlist.
4We should also go over how you're gonna do the pre-show and post-show
6I'll probably still be taking requests during the post-show.
6I have DBZ...
all at once
4But he keeps pushing it off
6I might download a bunch of things throughout the week for just in case purposes.
4Yeah
4There's gonna be a bit to go over next mod meeting
i know, right?
6Which definately has to be tomorrow.
6Or... later today, rather.
2Tir, Gremio, Cleo, and Pahn now.
back
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:35
two people at once
:'D
4Pretty much
oh I thought that was the 2 people clip
guess not
whoops
2Yep. I level-grinded Tir and Ted to level 11 before I got the Prosperity Rune.

haha, that does look cool
"HEY DO YOU LIKE SHARKS???" "yeah!" "GOOD CAUSE I'M DRAWING YOU A SHARK!!!"
"AND IT LOVES YOU!!!"
4She did?
6Yep.
6A while back.
XD
4Nice
6Rewound for proof.

6Paused on Ditsy.
XD
Uh
6lol Derpy recolor at last minute.
Is anything bad going on
4WHOA
/ has happened?
4BRONYPEANUT HAS ENTERED THE ARENA
I'm guessing no?
4Ah
4Bad?
4No, why?
6Nothing bad.
it takes a long time that early on to get 'em, but they're the best female accessory for a long time
and he said something about a "Calling all mods" thing, that I apparently was a part of
4What's wrong?
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
Was the target for a raid
4???
6...zuh?
4...Ponychan was being raided?
No
Well
lol
6Only thing I can even think of was a stupid post on the Mod Discussion thread that was literally just a bunch of letters.
/me 2will brb. Needs a glass of milk
6I swiftly reported it...
kk
.-.
12wisconsin has some really dumb statistics with alcohol
EW
4And it immediately got attention
Dont drink kids, its bad for you.
/me trollfaces
and something about the target of a raid
/me flees
and something about calling of mods
12lol
6How odd...
4Bizarre
6Is there even anything else?
6When/where did she tell you this?
Other than the fact that she decided to look through my post history
...random!
Right now
6Odd.
6Could you ask her to be a bit more... specific?
4Okay, seriously, does EVERYONE have the mods on tap?!
6I don't.
6I don't know any of them.
6I see Spike in the GET threads, but he doesn't really talk to me...
Okay
Do one of you
have the mod thread
for BMN
6Yep.
4Uh
6One moment.
Because I have APSOLUTLY
NO FUCKING CLUE
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/188267.html

YEP
Any relation to SgtSprinkles?
6None whatsoever.
4I was curious about that myself, actually

Well, considering SgtSprinkles is a ban-on-sight name?
Yeh~

0Oh
Being that it's IRC, it's controllable.
0xD
+m, voice, etc.
Reguler users were protect.
0All I know is /kick
ed
0cause that's all I ever use
6I know a lot of the commands.
I've been using irc since before I was 16. D:
0I'm a newfoal at this
0xD
6I just recently picked up IRC, I just do my research.
12noooo
6It's fairly simple.
And secure.
0Honestly the last person I kicked was yelling at us calling us names for picking Starship Troopers as a Bad movie
6The only pain in the neck thing is scripts.
Especially considering the hmask.
6Yes, very secure.
It's a horrible movie. xD
but it's horrible.
Mfw I have the games.
6>us
6>picking movie
4FUCK YOU STARSHIP TROOPERS IS AN A MOVIE
4Rinse and repeat'
4about five or six times
7So what's going on tonight?
6Nothing tonight.
0yeah
0I came in at the last second
6You actually just missed me practice streaming.
4He was gonna go with DBZ Evolution but decided against it
0and was like
0"I R HERE
-sighs-
According to my workschedule..
I don't get to come.
4Why not, Star?
3pm to 11pm.
6It's okay, we'll be doing a reshowing on Saturday.
6At 2 PM EST
0We're doing reshowings now?
6...XD
12lies
0Wow I am terrible at keeping up with you guys
truth
and veritas
4Nope
O sheeit.
I have Saturday off.
But it won't be the same.
4So when I was chosen, I was fucking ecstatic
I need to speak with an IRC pro that I can trust with classified informations.
6Hours ahead.
6 5 hours ahead.
4I swore I put "ahead." Damn, my mind is shot right now >_<
6Your head is full of ponies?
0Hmm
0Okay
0right?
4My head is full of Agalloch right now
6But we are looking for more Euromods.
well, I'm gonna turn in for the night too. G'night, all!
4Yeah, Hip and the others are hoping that we'll show up for it. We don't have to, but they would be very thankful if we did
0I see.
0Alright I'll do my best
0to be there
0Oh
0Shit
0......................................................
0AND THEN I REMEMBERED
6XD
6At first I was like, "Okay", and then I REMEMBERED THE FUCK UP
4At least, not every Saturday
4Haha, Sprinks
0My friend is having a birthday and wants me to come along
OH SHEEIT.
6That's why we're looking for Eurobronies
4Maybe we could have like mods taking turn to help mod Saturdays
6That would be most fair until then, yeah.
0Brb.
4Have fun man
6They'd never kill me.
4I thought about it, but decided against it
6I post in like, 4 threads.
6All of them are "official"
Wait, what's happening?
Not fully.
Do they play favorites?
4*then you die
6Also, as a GETter, I take pride in my ability to watch all of /oat/ at once.
0Nah they don't
0Well maybe
0Not entirely
I seem to remember them all attacking you at once, Bronypeanut.
Several times.
in an overkill manner.
0They constantly harass me.
Maybe they should be harassed back.
6They made that rule about not helping eachother because I would find each of their attacks, and post in the mane thread within 4 posts. XD
By the only roleplayer ever to have absorbed 3.5 mods!
0what's the .5?
Spike said no, use Twilight instead.
0Oh
6...lawl
0Well You, Spike, and Rainbow are the only mods I can really contact in a reasonable amount of time.
0-.-~
Watchu talkin' 'bout?
0Nothing.
0No it wasn't
0Liar
I keldeo'd it.
6...dat pun
6Shut up and take my internets!
You know that image of spike..
Shutup and take my money!
That was legitimately used on me once.
6I had an OC made about me yesterday.
Hm
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130802168927.png
/me goes to back up flame's services
People were sending me money without ordering ponies.

I told them to stop.
That pic was posted.
Everyone giggled.
6...lol wut?
mfw you don't lissen to my stories.
IT'S :c
6I was listening.

6:p
4So then that's a no
13Nothing at all
I'M REPORTING TO HER RIGHT NOW.
13*Pokerface*
I thought that perhaps I could re-join the community as myself.
I see now that's impossible.
4I knew it
4SUCCESS
4Don't worry
No. Not success.
if too many people know I'm going to get de-modded.
it makes us lose our rank.
13That's why I was confusing you
13but
13Whelp.
I already derp'd here a few times myself.
6:/
nothing going, might as well forget being myself ever again.
6...aww.
4I feel like I upset you, or offended you. I seriously did not mean to
13Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrddddddddddddd
6...your face is awkward.
Because I was BlazingStarshine since February.
As a mod, I have to watch every little thing I do.
Every little mistake is recorded and logged, to be thrown back in my face at a later date.
I'm not unhappy about being a mod.
6What, I'm not allowed to joke all of the sudden to break the awkward silence?
13It was about my face
13*tear*
6There are other people here.
6It could have been about dari, for all you know.
You're misunderstanding.
but fine~
4Sure, take it out on dari the poor chatroom
6Yay!
Anyone can say they're a mod. :p
Yeah. I work nights.
6lol
6To be fair, we don't even know you're the real BlazingStarshine
6And to be even more fair, I didn't really care in the first place.
13lol
6lol emoticon didn't post.
4To be honest, at this point, I don't give a fuck
13Exactly
13Do that
implying BlazingStarshine is real~
Wait.
13Wat
4Okay, I feel like people are being abrasive and apprehensive
6I have seen a poster by the name of BlazingStar!shine or whatever.
6So, yeah.
Actually!!
Wanna see it?
4Sprinkles, it's not you
6...meh.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35752546.html#35752646
6That is rather nice.

6The horrible thing is that actually made me chuckle.
13Oh. It looks like Moony is on.
13...Interesting

13But now I'm inclined to post a hug in that thread
13and I got a 502
13Lovely

502, it went through.
13Yup

6...wtf?
6Why?
:3
6Just, why?
No, you mean /why/.
I was joking.
=|
6I'm not surprised by that idea.
i think it was a bacterial infection in the lungs and airways
12oww
6...>>
6<<
12get some rest
no, it's only coughing, thats it
Coughing can be bad
6There needs to be a /spaaaaaaaaaaaaace/
or is it?
6SpaceCore would explode and then explode again.
12that's normal for bacterial infections
mmhmm
Make sure you do it in the sink or during shower
i know, did that a few times, it tasted nasty
Whenever I get the cold, this kind of things happen to me as well
Yeah, it does
o_o

It's Truth and Veritas
