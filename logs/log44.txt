I'm not really large anymore, but even when I was I had the alcohol tolerance of a 16 year old girl. still do. But I can keep drinking and drinking and drinking and never get sick :P

non-alcoholic beer is like getting inoculation shots without protection. pain with no gain
Shizzy, I see YOUR TEXT

6I have yet to get buzzed drinking beer...
6I always run out first.
Heh.
I abhor beer
Whiskey you pansy
i vant a t shirt of it
8exactly sprinkles
6Whiskey is my drink of choice.
not a fan of beer but love malibu and coke
/me 11had a single sip of beer. When he was 12. Because he thought it was cream soda. Neveragain.jpg.
lolz
/me enjoys all types of alcohol
<3
sounds like you guys need to drink some decent beer
I learned that gin and champagne is a nice drink.
Silverscreen, hah
bah
Guiness
I remember that XDD
/me hates the taste of most alcohols, and knows he would be an alcoholic if he started.
Mixed together.
8Silver: beer sucks
I first taste beer when I was 9.
11Hipster: No shit. XD
I like wine
guiness is alright i guess
me too
Don't shit on oat soda, Hipster.
Never did again for a while after
TGPFluttershy can barely hold apple cider :P
wine
wine is okay
I miss it.
6Beer is horrid. I love vodka, rum, and whisky.
I'm about the same R-Zack
How dare you, DonAngel
English beer is just as bad
white wine
Silvermane: same. I get drunk way too easily for my taste, and I find alcohol to taste sour.
wine is great
German beer or gtfo
6WhiskeyXSirSprinkles=OTP
i live in germany and hate beer
10:<
blasphemy
8Sprinkles: i am getting more and more convinced that we are the same person
Germans know how to drink.
/me 11wants to do the Pony Drinks for his 21st birthday.
doing it wrong, Elky :S
i am far too introspective to be healthy, and things that allow me to escape myself are extremely addicting.
6...I think we may be, Hipster.
transformers 3 was very patriotic though, SPOILER- they fight from a space bridge in D.C., where megatron shoots Lincon off the chair and sits in it himself
like ponies
i still don't get why people drink Ethanol
MEDIC
/me already did some of the pony drinks, Silverscreen
I also find alcohol to taste sour.
>inb4 hipster/sprinkles shipping
were they any good, TGPFluttershy?
Buy some of those pony shot glasses, then your alcohol will be 20% cooler.
11TGPFluttershy: they any good?
11Silvermane: Herdmine
yup
Really depends on what you like.
only if it's an RBD glass
11herdmind*
Nightmare Moon is really hard, for example
I tried the Applejack one, it was horrible
C2H6O is serious shit
11makes sense.
Fluttershy flows down smoothly
lol, herdmine is funny concept
isn't it just RD
stop poisoning your bodies
Dj Pon-3 is very interesting
8the only difference between us, Sprinkles, is that i would replace whiskey with gin
8also: weirdest blade guy
Imma leavin. Going to A&W
anyone wanna drink some Methal-Alcohol?
6I drink Gin, when I can.
But I really liked the Twilight
DJ P0n-3=DJ Pwn-3
Meh, I prefer not to drink alcohol, anyways.
Bye errypony
11I heard Vodka burns like a mofo.
seya
good gin is pretty nice too
bye
Gin + champagne > just gin
Silverscreen, yes it does.
later
6I haven't had enough kinds of Gin to honestly say whether I like it in general or not.
later tyranico
if you really want to get drunk.. 99% is the way to go
DJ Pwn-3 sounds more like a Battle Bot.
Hexanol=Best alcohol
trolololo
lol Yeah it does.
Juuuuden
fuck, Hexanol is real?
8Silver: its not that bad
I had this coctail with gin, coconut cream and sprite in it, it was really good.
Butanol is best
also, gin tonic is probably the best drink effort/taste wise
6It's not that bad if you get good Vodka.
8worst ive had is 151
not Hexanol
Captain Coke
6If you get the cheap stuff it's horrible.
uhh yeah silvermane of course it is
8that physically hurt going down
151 proof? Damn, 75%
6I will NEVER drink Vladimir again.
6EVER.
/me 12faceclaws
XD
/me 11takes notes.
>.>
8Ron Diaz rum, thats classy stuff right there XD
/me copies notes
I've tried Abstinthe the other day.
6Smirnoff is usually quite smooth.
Extremely overrated.
03I can't hear anything LL, just a bunch of scratchy noises
O dun drink
yep, cheap vodka is horrible
I'm going now too. See you alcoholics next week
6Absinthe will fawk yoou up.
CYA
8bye apokalipse
there was a preview that showed these robots fighting and it looked kind of like rockem sock em w/ rocky
Depends which type
Later Apok
lol later Apokalipse. sober for 6 years, and i'm only 20
night apok, be glad ghosties wasn't here
there are. hypothetically, an infinit number of alcohols
bye
FUBAR
Cocaine is a helluva drug.
11How about Everclear?
FUBAR!
Not the ones they sell at Bevmo, that's for sure.
called REAL STEEL
Pinkie Pie is a helluva drug
6Everclear is... FAWK
shut up
8everclear is...
Yeah! that's the one I need to try!
soldier
SilverMane, wait,what?
Pinkiecaine is a helluva drug.
Limonchello is another drink I like.
you can link as many coals as you want in a chain
6Everclear is illegal in some states. It's just that strong.
12then I don't know >.<
Cool?
no bjornfot, there's a finite amount of matter in the universe
*trollface*
i still like mojitos
be friends everypony
Everclear is great if you like spending time in the bathroom
I've seen it in Cali.
03headsets hate you
>implying you can't make more matter
12you think >_>
i went by a dog tag machine on the boardwalk and almost made a brony themed one for myself
let's say energy then
8fun fact: everything above 60 proof is illegal where i live
Has anybrony ever eaten a Ghost Chili?
6That sucks Hipster.
oh hell no, not going near no ghost chilli
6I don't drink below 70 proof.
8i had a ghost chili once
8never again
Ghost chilis are some mean sons of girl dogs.
fun fact: in Sweden, the government has monopoly on selling alcohol
i want to drink a 4 loko
someday
can barely stand basic chili levels
The afterheat is horrible.
6I've had a 4 loko, pretty good.
I think an indian woman did a world record to eat as many Ghost peppers as she can
cool
How many?
8 4 loko tasted like drinking a battery to me
oh yes it is elky
11Poor Noobs.
6Also, I loved ghost chili the one time I had it... but I'm weird like that.
but we don't have any other choice
you drank a battery?
that's why they can set the price as high as they want
HEY, now that I think about it. Anybody seen Ghosties?
to drown the sorrows of the long winter nights
GHOSTIES AIN'T THERE!?
Giggle at the Ghosties...
We giggled at him
no price is too high
I bought a two VHS set special edition of this at a yard sale
I giggle at them for teh lulz.
6But my sense of taste has forever been destroyed by drinking a gallon of Vladimir over the timespan of a week.
I love the mountains... I love the clear blue skies...
Ghosties is out with a friend or something.
11Hanks just flipped his lid.
SilverMane, that only works when your fear are not confirmed, like if you see an unusual shadow..
Where is Harvey dent. Harvey Dent, you seen him, you know who he is?
for cheap alcohol, we just cross the border to either Denmark of Finlans
8Sprinkles: wat
I miss ghosties
6NEVER. AGAIN.
*or Finland, what the hay
SPEAK UP SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR
homicidal mods are always fun
8when alcohol is measured in gallons...
you need to walk to the zoo?
HOLY CRAP She ate 60 ghost chilis in two minutes. JEEZ
yo theres mad lightning wher i live
Crowbar, ikr, even I couldn't eat something that fast.
? ! ? !
An average of every 2 seconds!
A ghost chili
6We had a rule in the house, no buying any alcohol when there was still some in the house... so we had to drink a gallon of Vladimir.
ugh
6I chugged a quart of it just to get rid of it.
Great acting in this movie
/me shudders
oh lawdy
How did she not become a sort of Flaming superhero from it.
8my brother and i both tried a ghost chili once, he rubbed his eye afterwards
6THREW UP SO MUCH.
:O Wow.
Lol Sprinkles, did it seem like a good idea at the time?
oh damn
dat compass
NOT A GOOD IDEA.
I can't bring myself to throw away the cheap vodka
that eye must have exploded twice
I once took a bottle of Dave's Gourmet Insanity sauce to school as a prank.
11DAAAAAMN, Sprinkles.
6To get that stuff out of the house, it was worth it.
8sprinkles: my mom would kill me if she knew i drank underage
but I'd never drink that much of it
6Tasted like charcoal.
umm... Hi
i once rubbed my eye after cutting a regular chili without knowing what I do, shit was not pleasant
HAI!
6It was when I was living with roommates.
evening gamer
A friend of mine tolf me to come here
6Hello JABgamer

TGPfluttershy
JABGamer, that would be me ;-)
Hello JABgamer.
Ohaithar, gamer.
hi
It's mainly perry though.
i cut a jalepeno and rubbed my eye once
my parents pretty much gave me permission to drink, as long as I didn't leave the house and took all the vocal abuse in the morning that my hangover would give me
8also, i once had to drink half a bottle of white label scotch before we could open a new bottle
So what we talking about?
8that was an interesting night
alcohol and peppers
booze
alcohol currnetly
i like monsters
6At the moment, alcohol and ghost chili
I guess chilis and alcohol.
Ethanol.
monster
Hipster_Brony my friend bought pure capsaicin (the active component in chillis that makes them spicy) dissolved in vodka, then dipped a pencil in it and thrust it in my mouth while I was concentrating on a game of starcraft. Face blew up like a balloon and I accidentally touched one of my eyes, went blind in it for a little bit
WATCHOUT ITS A TARP

Anyone remembered to vote for it on that TV website
YEAH THEY'RE REPTILIAN SHAPESHIFTERS
I did
Already did, R-Zack
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT, SIR
Twilight is the best pony
Best New Show and Best Musical Number
horse drawn horse drawn carriages made me laugh so hard
Canadian French can use the same words as French French, but we got other words that fit more the Canadian reality.
AMD THEY'RE THE ILUMINATI TOO
But MidnightLuna, Luna is best pony
No its Twilight
Hands down
Apple Pony is best Pony
Silly Silverman, that's not how you spell Fluttershy
dermathil swearing in french isn't my strength anyway, I haven't spent enough time there to know the slang well, so I can only swear literally
what sol said
Lyra is best background pony.
*Silvermane
Fluttershy > Twilight > Rarity > other 3
Tree pony is best pony.
(Insert "hats not how you spell" joke here)
Fashion Pony is second
No TGPFluttershy
fluttershy is worst pony
Fluttershy isnt the best pony
Applejack pony is best pony
applejack is teh besterest
shes the thrid best
Rainbow/Shy Pony is last
Fluttershy > Luna > Twilight = Trixie > Rarity > Rest
I like Applejack
trolololol
They are all the best ponies.
true dat
Sheesh,bronies.
THE BEST PONY
IN THE WHOLE SHOW
IS
/me brohoofs Silvermane
I liek Colgate.
octavia is great
yeah, Canadian French uses slightly more words taken from english than European French
O.O
Applejack > All other ponies
*brohoofs TGPFluttershy back
DOCTOR WHOOVES!!!!!
cotavia IS great
she's a good pony
dermathil that makes sense
Alright, who is best SIDE pony?
I would've thought Luna
All other ponies = All other ponies
:/
lol Colgate makes me laugh my ass off
Braeburn ofc
octavia, vinyl scratch, colgate, lyra
Brohoofs everyone
or Photo finish
Derpy, duh!
Lyra x BonBon is hilarious shipping
Luna Best Side Pony
DJ Pon-3 best side pony
Bradeburn is best side pony
Derp Pony is worst BG Pony (trolololol)
I don't get the lyra, bonbon, colgate etc. thing
im with dj p0n-E
lyra bombom is best shipping
Colgate is best background pony
11Life story out of fucking nowhere.
He knows they won't even survive 'til it reaches 500 bucks
they seem kinda... dumb to me
that's why he tells it, silver.
derpy has the most boring character design :|
Lyra and BonBon are always seen together in the show, and they are assumed to be best friends
@DetectiveBrony: I love you.
awww, I love you too
'cause he knows they won't even last.
I like Lyra because the whole fanart around her is hillarious
no homo
Lyra, Octavia/DJ Pon-3, Bon Bon, Derpy.
Yes. Obviously.
I love Everyone
I know that, but assuming thy actually have a personality
All of you
A Walk in the Sun is the saddest Lyra/BonBon ever
Even the ones I dont know
dunno
Random Pony is the most sane Pony

All Of you are Awsome just for the sake of being You
who else read minty breath or whatever it was called

You are Aweomse MidnightLuna

8Nittany_Tiger, why not?
how funny
.-.
last time someone suggested kicking everyone the admin started with me and only kicked one person
0D'oh
11I know. I'm hilarious.
obvious bait is obvious
oh, and 4chan mods basically can do whatever they want
0All the smoking cuts in this movie are getting me all riled up for some decent cigarettes...
8Elision: TROLOLOLOLOLO
Because of the bad rep of 4chan
it was Fireant in #eqd
8Nittany: it's NOTHING like 4chan
Ive never been on Ponychan
it's a fun place
8literally the exact opposite
agreed
A) I hate porn.
And im probably never gonna due to fear of Rule 34
11Nittany: Do explain. What kind of Rep?
no, dude, ponychan isn't fun
8no porn on Ponychan
>he hates porn
0back
I didn't care, it took me 12 hours to notice
WTH
I like to visit /sci/, people get trolled there pretty easily
11Ponychan is strict on it's PG-13 policy
ponychan is like 4chan, but replace anything bad with love, tolerance and PONY
11its*
/me Thanks hipster_brony
0 34 isn't that bad, you just ignore it after a while
and ponychan is cool, but it can get annoying at times
Who doesnt love pony?
0 4Chan
Ponies make the world go round
the key is to realize that there is no limit to how horrible the internet can be
Gonna go on topic. The most epic army scene in history. Though I haven't seen many army movies to begin with.
FiM chan FTW
8but yeah, theres no Rule 34 or porn on Ponychan
raise you hand if you like Pony

Nuclear friendship is pushing it...
0Nuclear fusion is just how celestia works
0though
Celestia has WMDs?!
Yes
Lots of them
Why do you think she's stayed as the ruler all this time?
0No nuclear fusion is how the sun heats up
0Oh yeah its also how newer nuclear bombs work to forgot sorry
You See Sir
Its Quite simple
So Simple that I cant explain it
0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What you guys doing?
0nuking shit thats wat
Stuff
Its FAWWWNNNN
Nothing. Why? Who told you we were doing stuff? Cause we're not you know...
0SirSprinkles are you there because Hey Listen Hey hey heyheyheyeheyeheyeeheyeyeheyeheyeye LIStenlisten listen listen listen HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I don't have to answer to you! I've done nothing wrong!
0Dashite you are traitor to the Pegasuses kind
Never. It's all those other bastards that are traitors.
They turned their backs on all of pony kind.
6I am infact, here.
0Fallout equstria is awsome
Yes. Yes it is.
03wtf
03why does that keep happening
03is services acting up?
03I'm obviously ID'ed since I'm +h
drf lol
Guest12540 is your alternate nick
12XD
03LOL what
03but my desktop turned into Guest62183
03it seems something's been acting up
0sileance across the land
12o.o
Oh noes!
0that would be the worst ending ever but somehow satisfying to know how kickass humans are
haha trolling #computerhope on mibbit
03LOL what
[13:43:04] <jcheung> .....is there a way to ignore or block or boot in this chat?
[13:43:22] <Archfiend> jcheung, try /ignore *!*@*
03LOL
0Its actually kinda cool because were actually beginning to make such things as lasers and railguns
6LIES! ALL LIES!
0Although not ready for real use but are laser would simply not need any ammo at all in fact it could just keep on firing
Hey, Sprinkles.
Hey, dari
0Sirsprinkles its not lies look it up or on youtube the navy has a pretty good video for it
So I'm adapting Silver's layout to add CSS.
6...I know, I'm not allowed to make an Austin Powers reference now?
6Seriously?
...nice.
0Oh SORRy:D
Also I got the domain name.
Also nice.
03oh wow @ this episode
btw, when we switch to that, I need to make sure I get it run through and approved by the firewall company, so we'd have to wait probably a few days before switching.
03FBI traitors
What, every new site need approval? Wow. O_o
needs*
0though the railgun is just awesome looking although it is a fucking semi long though but still it gonna be what maybe 20 30 years before the practical one
Basically, otherwise it comes up as "unrated" and gets blocked.
Mods aren't allowed to have a sense of humour. I'm pretty sure it's hidden in your contract.
._.
ha
So the only way to get it rated is to have it approved?
It's a big name firewall company though, so they approve thousands of requests a day, if not more.
Pretty much.
Meh.
How come you could view the site when I hosted it from my IP?
I can't here.
It's supposed to be surgically removed along with your sense of compassion and the ability to feel empathy for those under you.
I was at a different wifi.
yeah railguns
Ahh.
night all
You should bypass their firewall with tor. :P
Dashite SirSprinkles is actually pretty cool guy
6Our humor is actually ramped up in a trolling sense, when we undergo the surgery, Dashite.
Although his life is shit as far i as can see
12nini~
I've tried. So many things. >>;
03oh wow that was kinda an emotional ending
Ah, I guess I had your agreements confused with those of a forum I frequent. Carry on then!
I'm fairly sure there's no way to stop you from bypassing with tor unless they block tor/the tor port.
And Nexus is like 2.30 GB! For FREE!!!
No idea what tor is... but it's a big company, so it may be blocked.
6And yeah, sklar, it kinda is.
/me curls up
It's an onion router program.
But were here for you on the weekands and whenever else can you
Hmm...
may have to get it.
i ca find you
Why do I still have this so small? Not like I need to keep the video on screen now.
/me 12cuddles Shiny
Would it allow me to play my MMO's?
;o
Now I can read that purple text!
You could get another program to route the MMO through tor, I think that would work.
Doing that might make you lag on the MMO though.
Hmm... may have to do this...
Well SirSprinkles yah just gotta keep on going right
>implying lag isn't normal on the MMO anyway
Lawl
6What doesn't kill me and whatnot
Exactly
And then there was nothing
but silence
of course theres me so not really
Augh, how did I not see that before.
See what
Hey guys, I'm back. Hi Sprinkles!
Dashite
"SirSprinkles is a pretty cool guy. Eh kicks spammers and doesn't afraid of anything."
You're right, silence.
:D
:p
Oh you be trollin

12sigh

6I can stream, but I'm waiting for something before I do.
I need to get the link off Sprinkles to stream.
6Is your comp able to?
It can, dunno about my internet speed though.
But then A10 comes to kick magnetos ass magneto trys to metal crunch it but A10 made from special rubber and it kicks magnetos ass
6lawl
6Mine's the other way around, speed is through the roof, comp starts to suck after too long.

You know I've noticed a lot of you guys are regulars to this stream. Out of curiousity, how long have you guys been a part of this community?
The pony community or the movie night community?
Movie night
Me on BMN I've been here like 3 weeks or so and the pony community as a whole i think like 3 or 4 months
I've been here since the first one.
0You guys are still here? :O
I've been here since Friday.
6Been here since the first.
And I'm sticking around XD

6It would appear so, I had planned to stream more, but the thing I need to do keeps getting put off.
this is to show how much is going on in rl...
Wat getting put off SirSprinkles
Awwwww man.
Yeah, I probably need to go soon too, so I can't stream.
It's nearly 5:30 am and I have to get up at 7:30 am.
ouch
MAn if i was a mod and i had any computer skills i would do it because i never go to bed
2 hours of sleep, I remember those days X(
Ouch. I'd probably just stay up if I was already up that late.
Me too.
Yeah, I end up drowsier when I sleep for a few hours
^that
Yup. It's tough for the first couple hours, but after that I don't really notice.
You should sit back and enjoy the chirping birds, and watch celestia raise the sun
Yeah we would party all night and i would keep it going even if everyone went to bed because i am party of one
I can't take naps, they ruin my day.
I have to get atleast 6 hours or else I don't sleep at all.
I can't take naps. I either can't fall asleep at all, or I sleep for hours.
UK
Dashite: me 2
It's gotten me a couple times lately. I've tried to get a couple hours sleep before class and ended up sleeping through my alarm.

6Speaking from experience seeing some when I was looking at stations.
!fight Aurora
/me uses Crabhammer on Aurora! It's a critical hit! Aurora loses 206 HP! Aurora has 883 HP left!

6I hate this
12^
03yeah I'll trade too
SirSprinkles why are you still up
6even my POOL was sickeningly hot
6Because I'm STILL waiting to do what I was planning to do.
yeah but only the us has used them, not to mention it was a shameful attack
6there's something gross about swimming in a 87F pool in weather like this
6not comfy at all
12I was supposed to be taking them for a picnic on Saturday, so much for that ffs
6A gigantic argument made it stop for a while. >>;

6that weather is messed up lol
12No ovO;
6 72F, rain, at midnight
Ah
1222 c :3
03<Aurora> there's something gross about swimming in a 87F pool in weather like this <- LOL WTF 87 degree pool
I get we drop one but that prevented the war from strecthing out into a more bloody battle costing more than just a couple hundred thousand i know that sounds cruel but its true
hopefuly it's not coppermine :x
hopefully*
12Why hopefully?
6drf, that's what happened to my pool, because of the weather
well not hopefully
12and you asked me this before, it IS Coppermine
6the sun heated it up so much
03ah
oh I have? .-.
well, coppermine gets annoying
03so the temperature regulation didn't make it colder?
03that being said
6anyways though
03pour ice in it
03:P
6...
6I should
12Why is it annoying? ovO
the interface is worse than PHPBB's admin panel
03juts go empty the freezer
03like the tray of ice
03dump it all in there
Plus if we didn't make a treaty with them japan would have been fair game for russia
03it might help
12You talking about the old Coppermine? lol
actually, PHPBB's admin panel is worse
yeah the old one
6I'm tempted to-
6wait
haven't really used it for quite some time
12the new one is fine ^^
6I can turn the hose on
03LOL
6that's some freaking cold water
03that too
6"I'm filling up the pool dad"
03drain some of the water and then fill it up with the hose?
6and if it's too full, I'll dump some
6...
03drain it
6yeh
03right?
maybe but there is the fact that killing all those civilians was not really a fair move
03I want a pool XD
6not all of it
6but enough
03my mom refuses to get one
6this is horrible
ah
03because of liability
03like
I'll test it out
03if some kid were to wander into our yard
12Eep, need to make a backup of the DB..
03and drown
03their parents could sue it
03etc
03*sue us
Yeah i know
looool Arti, I haven't done a proper backup for like...a year
12I’ve been starting to not like cold weather ; ;
12:/
I'm that lazy
6>killing civilians isn't fair
12That thankfully doesn't happen in this country but people are already trying it DRF
wat
seriously, drf?
03yes
6um
._.
6I've read MUCH worse war crimes by other countries that just were dismissed because it wasn't OMFG A NUKE
03it's like how if you rob someone's house and hurt yourself, you can sue them
anyway war is bad and in a better world there should not be military
was
03I should do that, I need money
/me runs
awt
wat
.-.
03LOL, Arti
6that's why there are regulations about gate/fence security
6strict ones
03ever heard of a show called Fit and Fearless?
6I didn't even know how strict
03It made this G4 program
6There will never be a world without war.
03on world's sexiest TV shows
6War is a necessary turmoil.
03nobody ask why I'm watching it ;p
6the gate has to swing out, there needs to be a latch, and an inside lock
i love cold weather
6certain distance from the pool
6etc
lol I need to remove that
o_o
there is no war in equestria
Yeah but think about it without war we would have over populated a long time ago
God dammit mirc
!snowball Articuno
*kicks it*
/me throws a snowball at Articuno
12haven';t seen it no
!fireball Articuno
/me throws a large fireball at Articuno
6No CURRENT war in equestria.
>|
6Lunar went batshit, remember?
jejeje
lolol
12But Hmm, the law to beat the crap outa burglars here is being strengthened :3
12!snowball Articuno
/me throws a snowball at Articuno
timing haha
Fire and Ice dont mix
03Articuno
neither do water and oil
12If a burglar comes in, you're allowed to kick the crap outa them till they leave or even kill them if they're trying to kill you
6I like that law lol
03you know what the stupidest thing is
12What?
03that police officers in the UK can't have guns
6but something like that is allowed here
03I'm like
that's cool, Articuno
much better than most places
>|
And alot of our technology came from wars or at least competitions
03bad guys --> don't follow laws --> will have guns anyway
03so if the cops can't have guns
12We don't need guns
6basically, if they intrude, that's potential life threat
03all that does is make them die
12But some do have them
6so you can use defensive force
6even if it's deadly
12we have other weapons
Like say the space race between russia and us
03such as
03?
kung fu fighting!
/me hides
03tasers have a limit to how far you can shoot them
12Stun guns, which work fine for most crims here. But.. when police are out of force with dangerous people, they do have guns
12Like that guy who murdered a load of people then did a runner
12the police were fully armed XD
anyway, bbl dinner
We thrive when when we have someone to compete with
03well all I read was that the police in the UK couldn't carry gunso.o
12Seeya NS
bai NS
03that's totally a stereotype
12I've seen a million reports AND videos of police using unreasonable force
03every bullet fired from a police's gun has to be documented in an official report
12Not a stereotype, videos like that come up on Fark all the time :/
6A lot of tech wouldn't have developed if we didn't develop nuclear warheads, either.
12True
12Yeh and the government always favours the police
03and the officer can get in serious trouble if they shoot someone without just cause
03no they don;'t
yeah that is true but still i do belive its possible to live in peace
12That's so not true
03I happen to respect what the police do though
12They SAY it was reasonable and are let off all the time
03it's like those people who say they hate cops because they got a speeding ticket
/me shot
03I'm like, is it THEIR fault that YOU are breaking the law?
/me finds out who shot LL and forces htem to file a report
12I don't care about stuff like that DRF but when police SHOOT and KILL homeless folk for carring pocket knives to carve wooden sculptures?
No it isn't were a naturally violent specis and even if came to peace with ourselves what about more advanced specis
12US cops fail sometimes :/
03that's an extreme example
wat
03let me put it this way
12but that KEEPS happening
12I read fark news all the time and every week there's something else XD that jsut DOESNT happen here, ever
03it's the same logic as my mom hearing about a few kids getting raped after talking on chatrooms, and therefore saying chatrooms are dangerous
03all they ever show is the bad stuff
we are raised to be violent but we could be raised diferently
03For every cop that shoots someone
03there's a few million that dn't
03*don't
12DRF
12It doesn't matter how big a country is..
6wtf kind of statement is that
12If you take the same area
12and the same population
6We're raised to be violent? Really?
12and count up all the police crimes there..
12It amounts to the same
6I'm pretty sure I was punished in school whenever I got in a fight...
03I'm just saying there are a lot more police in the US than there
12and yes
12I get what you're saying about it
03so of course there are going to be more that do stupid things
03as more = more
6I don't like some of the stuff police do around here, but I sure as heck feel alot safer with them being fully armed
12But still, there are just.. too many reports..
12One is too many
03if there's anything I've learned
03it's that news ;always exaggerates everything
6The human psyche works off fight or flight. Everything is a conflict.
And besides it wouldn't help in the long run
03every single news anything in existance
12Videos don't exaggerate
Well, good night guys! I'll get out of your hair now
03the only way to get a 100% truthful story is to see it with your own eye
03Articuno
03so are you saying that if you saw a video on Fox news
03that you would believe it?
good night
6LOLfox
03because they show the same sorts of videos as anyone else
03:P
12Depends on what the video is Ovo
and plus, theres always edits in the video :P
03LOL
03I doubt news stations edit their videos
03but I will say this
they do :P
Its basically essential to know how to wage war and fight if we are to survive with more advance specis when we do hit that time
03but even if the cops weren't allowed to have guns
not in that way but we are surrounded by violence so much that we have come to accept it like human nature
03if they're CORRUPTED
03would that stop them from having one?
03I don't think so...
6I try to think of it this way
It is human nature
12No but
03it's like that statement, passwords only keep honest people out
6what would crime be like around here if they didn't have guns
12If they weren't allowed a gun and they had one, they;d probably be in trouble just for that
Or why there be so much of it
6I don't think UK has the same ridiculous amount of crime like we do
12Nope
03Laws are completely stupid if peopole don't follow them
6so as horrible as it is, I'd rather the police have their guns on them
6Honestly it's not human nature.
6beesides
12It's just scary that you need guns
6It's just nature.
03same here Aurora
03well
speed limits :3c
6there's FAAAAR more good cops than bad
03Articuno
03if someone comes up to you with a gun
03and you don't have a gun
03say goodbye
03LOL
Yeah i agree with you there SirSprinkles
6That's just the way the foodchain is.
6Eat or be eaten.
12Like I said, people here don't have guns XD
03well then that's fine
on guns i believe gun possession shouldn't be a right
12Only the gangsters do LOL and you never see them, unless you're involved XD
03but that won't stop bad people from giving them
Outsmart or die
03yeah
03see
6in my part of the country
03Rifles or shotguns, sure, I don't care
03as you can actually hunt with those
there is a diference between survible and killing to feed yourself and going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's
03BUT WHY THE F*** IS IT LEGAL TO OWN HANDGUNS
6 4 out of 10 people will have a gun
12No idea :/
03You can't hunt with a handgun, so all it amounts to is killing people
i think it should be a privilege
03heck
12I agree, handguns wtf
like hunting itself or fishing is certain areas
in*
03it's legal to own assault rifles too
03which is just stupid
x.x i hate gun talk
need a license
12LOL Assault rifles XD
please
^^;
12LOL
03I hate MLP talk
6Which is generally put forward as being wrong in society.
12I got distracted, need towork
03wait
03no
12*to work
03so do you
03I hate o3o talk, does that stop you?
/me runs
wait it's legal to own an assault rifle :V
;p
o3o nope
03yes it is Zoroark
o3o
6"going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's" is due to being, well, not sane.
03my uncle has a FEW assault rifles
unless you are at war n then u get a medal
03I got to fire one
03that being said it was cool
well i guess it would be
03but I was like, this feels illegal
03XD
6No.
i think it's illegal to carry one
12drf, you’re the one who just mentioned MLP XD
6You get medals for doing the right thing.
03probably
03well
12MLP >v>
03owning and carrying are separate
yeah
12What is there to talk about XD
03THANK YOU ARTICUNIO
i know
drf with a gun infront of a pony...hmm.....
/me RUNS
03-I
03People here keep posting links to MLP videos and then get annoyed with half the channel, including me, rages
there is lots to talk about MLP, just like there is about guns & legislation
6Going batshit and killing those that are unarmed is a war crime.
12[01:34] <~Articuno> What is there to talk about XD <-- Sometimes I don’t know XD
6If they can't fight back, don't fight them, really.
6I think this MLP stuff is getting horribly annoying
bronies usually just talk about the same things with ponies added or something
12Ok well I don't get it XD
i think
03indeed
6I didn't realize how consumed the forum is
i dunno lopl
6I like it, yes, but I hate how popular it is
12LOLOL
03also Articuno, I'm surprised you and Xai are so favorable of the Democrats then, because Republicans are the ones who are about limiting things, such as gun rights :P
LOL i do have one random question, on the TST home page, that theme music at the bottom, is that custom made? XD
uh
12Republicans are pro a lot of things we hate as well XD
what drf
12But that's another story
12It's all about the lesser of two evils remembver that XD
03Yeah
03see
12All politicians are idiots
^
03I honestly hate all..yeah
12XD
drf republicans want less government control :V
03I just tend to agree iwth republicans more
03Zoroark, what
03Republicans are known as liberal, yes?
03liberal = freedom
Exactly
03last time I checked
03o.o
i do see your points but once you actually see all the pointless deads and resources spend on killing you wonder if there is not a better way to live
uh
03wait
no?
03Democrats = liberal
Arti: who made the theme music for tst XD
03is what I meant
yeah
im kinda curious
12Though what's annoying me is that our Prime minister is putting out suggestions, getting opinions then changing his mind based on the country's reaction.. and is actually getting slated for changing his mind? ovO
12People are so dumb, if you force a law onto them they get angry, if you check whether it's ok with them they get angry!
12WHAT
6It simply would not happen.
03All I really pay attention to legislation-wise is copyright issues
03and all I know is Obama and Biden are worse copyright lobbyists than nayone we've had before :/
I far as i can tell no i guess I've just come to accept that
6With billions of people in the world one person would eventually turn violent.
12-v-
12Ew Obama
03as much as Bush didn't do anything, he also didn't give in to copyright crap :P
i guess i'm the same, just whatever gets told to me via the internet
6And the only way to stop that violent man would be more violence against him.
03let's see, Bill Clinton, Democrat, signed the DMCA
03Bush, republican, nothing
12It's just another way of leaching money from the country
03Obama, democrat, tons more copyright legislation
03HMMMM
03Now me, being a pirate, who would I logically side with? :P
12XD
12The funny thing is
as much as he did nothing, he did nothing :B
03exactly
03nothing good, notheing bad
03*nothing
i think i'd much rather vote for obama than any of the republican candidates
03eh
03I hated everybody in the 2008 election LOL
12It works here too, that our democratic equiv is all pro copyright laws
So who thought they ever be having a conversation like this on BMN
12and yet the conservatives are not really
i will probably this election
6yay 2012?
03I hope the Republicans have some really good peopl ein 2012
03because I want someone actually good to vote for
maybe humanity is rotten from its core and there is no way to change that but it is nice to try n do better n live in peace
6speaking of which
6I should register to vote
lol
6OH YEAH, I hate the voting setup in this country
03and this is one benefit to watching FOX News, since it's a republican channel, they have lots of coverage on the republican candidates
/me hides
03Aurora, get this
03I registered to vote to save our local library
12right back to work
in my mind it's the lesser of two evils deciding between republicans and democrats, in which case i'd pick dem
03I didn't care about the main elections
6I'm not saying it's rotten.
/me Now Playing: Pendulum - Propane Nightmares -Celldweller Remix-
6see, same would have gone for me
i hate the way politics is going
03but there was an election about city millage about whether to close the library or not
6except I was too late
love this remix ;3
6It's a result of escalation.
03and I was like NOOO YOU CAN'T CLOSE THE LIBRARY
03so I registered to vote
03and went and voted
03XD
6I was going to vote about a tax increase to save the schools
03as it is, most people voted against the tax increase -_-
6a tax increase of like...50 dollars a year
6WHICH PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST
03so they're having another vote on August 2 as a one last attempt thing to save the library
6it would have saved our schools majorly
03I'm definitely going and voting agian
6Things can be handled with civility, but there will inevitably be violence somewhere down the line.
6and they said no to it >.>
03*again
03because public libraries are a must, IMHO
03and I just can't picture our library closing :/
i love my public library
6paying less than 10 dollars a month is horrible apparently
6It's our way of proving who's the alpha.
03LO
6if it goes to education
03*LOL:
even if i never go there
12Our libraries are closing >v<
03yeah same
6Most animal species do it, really.
03I mean
03screw books
6I never go, but I don't want them to go
03but our library has free DVD and even Blu-Ray rentals
12I love libraries
03and that's just plain awesome
i love books
12LOL
6It's just that when we do it we do it with armies of people we've already established dominance over.
03they even do Wii/PS3/Xbox 360 game rentals
03for $5 for 2 weeks
03totally better than anybody else
03:P
i just haven't read any in a while
books <3
In the end i see everything in gray
12Books are awesome :3
6Things will never be black and white.
anyway yeah i'd definitely vote for a tax increase if it was going to the right things
6Everything is more complex than it seems.
6yeah
6but people have a negative IQ around here
6Without the complex chaos, there would be no simple order.
12Zoroark> anyway yeah i'd definitely vote for a tax increase if it was going to the right things <-- I KNOW RIGHT?
6that and they're self centered
12But NOOOOOO we have to spend it all on benefits ://////
i feel almost too smart here
03people here are all "I DON'T WANT OT PAY MORE"
03*to
6it's either the people who's children are old and off to college/have no children in the shcools
6or the people who can't even speak english, which is 20% of my town
03LOL MEXICANS
6yeah
6it makes me rage
6so much
maybe if people really thought things throw and there were an end to some peoples greed (cause down the line thats what its all about) a change would be possible
03I would love to see illegal mexicans in michigan
>>
04o-o
Im half Mexican :P
i like in a redneck town and i feel almost too smart
live*
6I have NOTHING wrong with mexicans alright?
03yeah same here
i know ;p
6I hate the fact we have SO MANY that can not even manage to say hello
03it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate
12Who cares if you're half mexican lol, we're talking asbout immigrants
03LOL
lmao
12ovO?
12I don't get that :>
lrn English
03what pisses me off
6what's worse is when their 6 year old daughter needs to translate for them
-_- i just fell asleep on my keyboard -_-
>I would love to see illegal mexicans in michigan
>it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate
>mfw
12D:
03is that they have to make packaging bilingual now
04wat
6This is about to go from a theological discussion to a religious one, so I'd like to stop it before it does.
6or even worse when their 12 year old son CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH
12Hmm
03and beause Michigan is incredibly far from Mexizco
03-z
03the few mexicans I do know are obviously here legally
/me walked in on a debate
/me walked in on sarcasm
12Our Prime Minister doesn't support the whole multi culturalism, he thinks everyone here should just BE British if they're going to live in our country :/
6if you're going to live in this country
/me walked in as a Scout
6LEARN THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE
lol Drake, just shun it off and let em debate xD
Well this is never going to stop if we just don't stop here were all hard-fixed on what we belive so like Sir Sprinkles said lets stop it here before we really start to fight
in my mind i kind of see it as it's excusable because i would probably be the same if i moved to a different country
12Which is a good thing in a way, because all the other races are trying to make Britain into something else
03Aurora, techincally we don't have a national language :/
6I don't mind culture, I mind communication
/me rages about some culture and departs
6...
6you're kidding me
03no
03look it up
6when 995 of the country speaks english-
6...
lolol
6 99%
6wth
6alright well
6I still stand by this
English is mostly our main language drf :P
its to late for it anyway... jejeje... we should all try to be more like the ponies lol
when you get to a certain point in your life it'd be pretty hard to learn a new language
03yeah
03I mean
03my sister is traveling in Europe
6I've had enough arguing for one day anyway.
03and she's staying with English speaking people in Germany
wtf is je
6make an attempt
12Probably because it['s better than being stuck in their country? XD
6And it's only quarter of 4.
03I would much rather not the Germans go "GERMAN OR GTFO"
aurora, because maybe you can have a slightly better life or something?
:V
6make an attempt though
04She's travelling
04that's different
6I went to italy for 3 weeks and did everything i could to learn the language
12Hey Drake
03I don't mind people speaking Spanish, but I fricking hate that they're making packaging for things like videogames bilingual
also again who thought they would be having a argument like this on BMN
03well, she's 14
04hey night
6I've forgotten it now, but I was able to hold out minor conversations
03XD
6enough to get me by
03well
6Wasn't really an argument so much as a discussion.
6AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO SAY HELLO, HOW ARE YOU
03the thing is
12I went to Italy and had to TRY and speak Italian, it was so funny
03she's actually staying at someone's house
i guess it's inexcusable if they simply don't learn anything, but i'm sure that most people that move here from other countries make valid attempts to learn at least rudimentary engliosh
03it's not like she's in a hotel
03it's part of a band trip
english*
12Why is she there?
Okay discussion but it was heading that way
12Ahh
04I tried to speak spanish in Venezuela. Hilarity ensued
6I just wanted it stopped before it became one.
03yeah
>
03fine arts camp
033 week tour in Europe
>band trip
i hate your band drf
12Well all she needs is a German phrase book
03including Germany, France, and Belgium
03LOL Zoroark
03my band went to Londo
03n
no u
03I GOT SO CLOSE TO MEETING ARTICUNO :(
:I
Pick your fights Right
03I AM STILL SO MAD THAT I DIDN'T GET TO >:@@@@
6The second religion comes up, it's instant arguing, and the mention of greed would only lead there.
03er
yeah
12Back to work XD
03>:((((((
03didn't mean to look angry XD
12I'm gonna minimize this now D:

03I want to go back
6my parents keep saying "you should go"
03because I lost all my pictures
03pissed me off so much
12Seeya Articuno
6I'm like YES I SHOULD, SEND ME PLEASE?
I wanna go to Europe for SoS next year XD

6and they always mention a trip there, like my dad and me or something
04I wanna go to the moon

i don't remember doing that and it has been a long time since i past logged in
/me 12has ice cream
ohai
so i just noticed my comments thing on my profile, and it's 8 of the same thing
OH
that reminds me
Articuno, you want the screenshots now?
Skylands told me you didn't get them
so I was like "oh crap"
but what strikes me as weirder is that they are timestamped as 1 January 1970
shit
hm
12I've noticed errors after posting. It sometimes thinks I double clicked or tried to start a new topic when I didn't.
that comments thing appears to be on more acconts than mine, but it doesn't appear to affect all comments. I still think it's weird though.
Also there are 8 or so of the same comment on my page.

04...if it loads...
06xD
12:<
04Oh please tell me I didn't delete something important earlier...
12D:
12That could be potentially disastrous
04No, really?
06verify game cache? (if you're talking of tf2 even :P)
06And it should check + download any missing critical files anyway
04It just stays on the "Preparing to play Team Fortress 2" pop-up much, much longer than it should
06sometimes it's there for a second, sometimes for a bit longer. I'm not entirely sure why :P
12hmm.
o_O
uh
maybe it has to do with the program I'm running that's using 100% CPU...?
04It's not the server
o_o
nightnight
04It's my computer actually loading TF2
12o_O
Ah
12noooo
06The server is just hilariously laggy as it desperately tries to monopolize your CPU :D
/me dies
04:/
04bah
12:<
04I'll just play it tomorrow
[20:49:53] <%Espeon> The server is just hilariously laggy as it desperately tries to monopolize your CPU :D
[20:49:54] * Espeon dies

Awesome. I'm wanting to get the Monday Email sent out.
6k, just a sec
06heya Ray
/me is attempting to do mod duties and cook pancakes at the same time.
6Should I link to the twitter, fbook, steam, and email in the post?
6Or not bother since it's all on the site now?
Put the links anyway.
...better yet, link them to the home page of the site
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/327341.html
Email Sent
6We need to put the Steam group link in with our links, btw.
6I would have done it myself by now, but I lost the link. Derp.
6Though I could easily just get it again.
I forgot about the Steam group.
I can just put it in Thursday's email.
6Also, I was thinking we should put a "History" page on the site, with a brief rundown of all the past BMNs.
6So everypony would know what we've already streamed.
I had that Idea too, but I'm saving that to put up on the Tenth BMN Night.
6Yeah, sounds good.
06!doom

13Funny word of the day?
12DISKS, they spin around and around LOL
11"IT always feels like....Gabe Newell's Watching meee"
6And no, Silver, TF2 doesn't count as a purchase.
Silver he's watching you
He'll get you in your sleep

Hi Feather~
lol
06heya Feather

10hi~
11So...no purchase means no game in my Steam Account, which means until I get moolah, I'm not able to do much on Steam.
06heya Aurora
nothing better than being woken up by a couple angry mockingbird parents outside your window
that happens? o - o
6...the Sprinkleburg on Steam is me.
6And yeah, no purchase = no ability to do anything.
Why am I not surprised?
you've never heard an angry mockingbird before?

thats how I saw them
ray you're the third person to ask me that
xD
02xD
they act like dogs that are smart enough to not go out and play in traffic
6mainly because she has much more control over time, homura's is extremely limited
6in the long run of course
13If you get a pet peacock, I can instantly assume you'll name it Shen :P
6in the short run, it'll either be a draw unless one catches the other off guard
6SHEN
6LORD SHEN
6that's only if I get a white one

Team fortress 2
oh lol. Only thing I have on Steam is Portal
XD
Hahaha I know the feeling
I have Alien Swarm, SEGA Genesis & Mega Drive classics
I have TF2, Spiarl Knights, and Portal |D
*Spiral
7Eh, TF2's free, FYI. :P
and my Sprial Knights that i havent even played yet
7I would like more people to download it so we have a TF2 community on TST. XD
I'm gonna get Plants v. Zombies and Street Fighter..
I LOVE those
gonna start shooping together some cutie marks for my OC, but it's hard to even think of what to make it about >.<

6GIANT PINKIE PIE BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL

YAY!!!
12I am here!
hi Arti
:D
10:3
12Hello!!! ^v^
12Hihi
lol I read Artwork
:3
Yep she did this morning ^^
I asked her
10k
Well I'll get pics for you after I've done it.
I emailed it to myself so I could look at it during work LOL
God if I ever get caught on chat... if they look at my history.. I'm dead
7Then leave. D:
10Yeah, don't take risks of getting fired
thats why there's a history delete button :D but yeah dun get caught. Safer to leave
Im addicted though D:
lol I don't mean THAT history
They monitor everything here you see..
Tor is still the answer to all problems.
I'm hoping that I can get away with this because the URL for the widget embedded in TST is a little obscure
that and they've never picked up on the fact that I load the shoutbox url
oh I see. Sounds like my computer class
heh ive always went on IRC during school XD
13Arti, the gallery won't let me upload stuff :<
12What;s the error?
13"Sorry, there is no album where you are allowed to upload files"
12LOL
12Have you created an album then? XD
13I read on the info page that you're given an album by default o-o
13Well I tried making my own album anyway
12ovO
13then I was apparently able to upload files to it
13but none of the files actually showed up
13and instead the album was filled with art that wasn't mine o-o
;o
12If you would like your own gallery for uploading your own art, you are free to do so at any time as your account here automatically gives you a free gallery, just hover over "My Profile" and click "Create/Order my albums". This ONLY works for the fan art gallery, you cannot create your own albums in Sprite Art.
12ovO
13I did that, but it won't let me upload anything :/
12One sec
12It doesnt show that you've created an album, what did you click first?
13The first thing I tried to do on the gallery was upload a file, since I assumed I already had somewhere that I could upload to o-o
13I did create my own after that and tried to upload stuff, but after that failed I gave up and deleted it |D
12How did you create your own?
12I meanlike, where did you clcik for it? (because I do it differently since I'm an admin D:)
12Stupid SMILEY!!!
13My profile -> create/order my albums -> new album
12ovO is that "My profile" option still there?
12XD
13Yep o-o
12LOL where? XD
12Sorry ^^
12What's the link and what button is it next to?
13In the TST Gallery at the top where all the links are o3o
13right at the end, next to "search"
7On another note, I'm drawing cubism.
7(Summer art assignment.)
12I smell smoke outside
12Ok XD I don't have that LOL!
12Stupid me
12Can you paste the link please?
Send it to EqD :P
13The "create/order my albums" link?
12I must have tested all of this from Xai's profile since it's so different on my account XD
12The profile link
12If it is a link
13It's a hover link o3o If I click it it just takes me to my forum profile
12Ahh cool XD
12Ok the link to create/order then please? :3
13http://www.lugia.us/gallery/albmgr.php
12Ahh gotcha
12Ok, just click new Album
12I'll talk you through it
12Type the name, press the OK button
13Done
12Now
12Click upload file
12Don't add any info to the album yet
12What idiot is setting fireworks off at this hour >>
12See if it lets you upload now
12lol XD
12ovO
12It worked
13It doesn't seem to actually show up in the album though o-o
6arti is at work
12Now, espy, you can go back and edit the album if you like but just leave out the keywords
6Angel watch ano hana
12I have approved it
12It'll show now
/me 6's job is done
12They have to be approved first
13Ah right, thanks a lot <3
12Lol I need to write that in giant red letters somewhere XD
12Anyway yeh, don't add any keywords, it'll take every image in the whole gallery with that keyword and add it to your album :3 LOL
12Its a really handy feature for the Lugia, Arti, Other bird Pokeyman albums but NOT the personal ones
12Seeing if there's a way to work on that now
13Ah, I didn't know you had to approve the images for them to show up LOL |D I think that's where I got confused
6oh yay I'm in charge of fireworks this year :D
12It's ok ^^
/me 6goes pyro
12it just shows I need to make it clearer now
/me 12goes to do thatnow
so many idlers o - o
o-o

6it's 4th of july
6I'm willing to bet a lot of the US people are busy
12Darn it TV ad's stop making me want things

Hello?
12Yeh it's a beautiful night, just been outside making a phonecall and it's actually warmer out there than her
12*here
12Also sorry for poofing earlier, had a serious chat with a colleague
12There, big, bold red letters now. Can't be missed XD
6arti I pm'd you
6:>
6oh god those are big red
6I refreshed the page and BLINDED
12:D
13Well, I think I've uploaded everything I want to upload for now :B
Happy 4th of July everyone
12Just approved a crap load
12XD
LOL
10DDD: it may storm tonight
12Gah, I would love to be able to just.. like.. not approve anything, but we've had abuse in the past
6Hello.
Nice to meet you.
6Sorry, paying so much more attention to /choat/
6XD Lolipop
yeah sprinkles please explain this whole choat thing to me? :3
You mean on Ponychan?
Arty are you seriously giving me a fine artist award
i don't deserve it
o.o
sup ghosties :D
4Hmm, I expected Sprinks or Hip here
4Well
4Fuck
6Rainbow mod is enforcing the /oat/ is for pony related randomness rule, which means many native /oat/ies are being forced onto /chat/ter territory.
4Sup RainBro
12?
4:O
fan*
sorry
6And since it all happened at once it's a giant mudfest.
4Yeah, I know Sprinks
13Ah, damn. Not sure how but I THINK I may have accidentally uploaded a few things to the wrong gallery x-x
so Sprinks they're moving all the deraily-madness into /chat/?
13oh
4I'm in the thread having a conversation with Hip
13wait
Chat's gonna love that...
13coincidentally all my gift art have eeveelutions in them
13maybe that's why |D
4But he hasn't answered me :(
4But I mean really
12:>
12I fixed some of tyhem
4If /oat/ really does move into /chat/ I'll be fucking surprised
4I fully expect all drama/mudslinging/internal politics to stay in /oat/
I was just about to start posting on /oat/...
YIKE
+s
4Do it
that just pop out of no where
I think I'll pull out for a while until the dust settles, so I know where I am and what I'm doing
4Haha
4Hey, Sprinkles, do you have the BMN site link?
4Hip says it's pretty much done, and I want a good look at it
/me 7pokes Arti.
you mean the 'home' at the top? D:
7May I have my gallery moderator privileges back? :3
12Yeh I'm working on it lol
12as well as working on work
12Thing is I'm not sure how to fix it yet :/
7Ah, well, work on work first.
4Is that the site?
pretty much
that and the about us page
Thanks to Silverscreen for the site
sir did you get my message, my graphics driver fail and i had to turn off my computer
4Ohhhh, gots to fill in mah "About Us" part
4I most certainly have a favorite movie
4And favorite pony
:P
Hey guys
yo ^^
I saw Ghostie's Location
And i saw NC
I think it means
NICHOLAS CAGE
4FUCK YEAH
12Quan
lol'd
12When I get this fixed, I want to remove the approval thing.
4I'm NC for NICHOLAS CAGE, motherfucker :D
12I think bothof us and possibly one other will be enough to cover things
12if say there's an abusive image
/me is going to try to draw a floofy peadge in a nest at a park
RIVERSIDE MOTHAHFUCKAH
7Okay.
7As for approving guest requests?
12Guests cannot upload
you won't need approval if you a member but you need one if your a guest
7Eep, to clarify, I mean comments. :P
12Ahh
12Those go in automatically I think
12There';s a "last comments" link to make things easy though, if you want to check them all
hi
7Okay.
Paging Mr. Sprinkles, you are needed at once
/me is off to bed
06Gnite all
12Night!
Arty what color should I make the peadge
12?
12What peadge...?
I'm thinking of drawing a peadge but I need an image in my head to what to make it
12Um
all of them?
14^v^
/me nuzzles back
Damn im bored.
6Silvershine, thank you for the error report.
/me sees another Lugia enter the nest
4Whew, glad you got it
14where?!
behind you
4I was looking for the mod page over on /chat/, but you can only imagine how difficult that must have been considering /oat/'s begun flooding into that board
z#rp okay ^^
/me 14looks behind her but sees nothing...
-z
12Quan?
12I was wrong, guests do appear to require approval ovO
12for comments
6I need to smack Silver.
6For "fixing" the link I had put in.
6He needs to learn you ALWAYS test your links.
12Which is good becuase I just deleted 12 spam ones LOL
6That's like, first rule of web page design.
14hello there c:
stupid computer....
hiho
hello
4Maybe you should be the website guy then :P
12hmm
12Feather you there?
10Yup
12Did you approve your own art?
12I'm just wondering why it's not working for Quan ovO
10o.o I'm currently just uploading
12ovo is it auto approving then?
12Wait
12I stupid XD
12I set it to auto approve for mods XD
10LOL
12I'll have to look at the database when I get home, unfortunately I can#'t access it here >v> blocked
03OK so sigh
03I didn't even want to be using Windows right now
03I'm really pissed that something isn't working
03I need to do a reinstall of the OS
03but I can't boot from anything
whats not working
03which is kinda a serious problem
03I put in my Windows 7 disc
03and it just sits there and doesn't boot
boot sector virus?
03no
6I'm really good with html, and I have all the links for emergencies such as this, but design isn't my thing, so I'll leave that to Silver.
03I don't have viruses
4Gotcha
4Did you let Silver know?
12Right, I'm off home, all top chatter awards from June have been given
12I'll finish up when I get home, seeya in a bit!"
YES!
finally I got my profile video working
6Not yet, I'll tell him about it.
4Alright
Ohey a copy of me
There
6Hey, Ghosties
6What do you want put as your favorite Pony and favorite Movie?
4Vinyl Scratch as favorite pony, and Jacob's Ladder as favorite movie
6Vinyl Scratch, niiiiice.
^best pony
6I need to change my favorite pony, because it's WRONG.
4Also
4I was wondering if you could add something like "Admin of BMN Steam group" under my Brony State Duties.
6PR
6Would be
4Yeah, that's good
ö
ö
rbd's gonna go have a shower, get some alcohol and then eat something before he passes out
catch y'all in a bizzle nizzles
4See ya, RBD
4Thanks, Sprinks!
6I'd add PR under mine, since I usually get the Twitter, but then my list would be too long. XD
7Hmm.
/me 7thinks about what to name her female Absol.
hmm
7I temporarily thought of Marly. :P
4XD Apple Bloom
4Why was Rarity listed as your favorite?
6I. Don't. Know.
6I think they were thinking mane 6. XD
4Ah
4Well
4That's just not the case :P
Shadowtalon :O or...
lol, that'd be a good name too :>
7Lag, Aero?
7Shadowtalon's too long. D:
10I'd say Soul but it's female
10Maka :D
7Exactly, at the first part, Feather.
7Maka... ehm, maybe.
hmm, sorry Quan
I wasn't thinking
XD;
7That's all right.
let's see....
Silverfur
13Lilith, maybe?
I usually name my Pokemon warrior names XD; I just think they sound cool
7Nice suggestion, AE.
SUDDENLY BORED
/me is gonna go lie down
bbl
7Okay. o.O

4:O
10Hey mom
6Hey
6How are ya?
6Has there been any life on here the last few days? :O
I love how DCD and Dari have no information :P
it's like DCD is just a stream-bot, and Dari is the silent protector of all things coding-related
6Yep.
6Especially since there's no image for dari either.
Since she already joined?
4I wonder why DCD hasn't filled out his info yet
6Iunno.
6 /oat/ has reached a level of slow I've never seen before.
6It's faster than this at 2 AM...

Sup bros
(I also have one, scary)
SUP BANE
thanks. If I fail I'll blame it on ghosties for sabotage
you know it apok :D
7Approving is biased, if we talk about it such-so.
7Or I could make it democratic.
6Feather. FEATHER.
wb Feather! :D
7Approve all, un-approve those that get at least -5.
6you scare me

7Meta.
6GET OUT OF MY MIND
Hey Prince, do you guys in EU do anything during the 4'th of July? Mock us or something :)
10WHAT
o-o
Yeah ghosties, we buddies :D
we sit around sipping tea making slightly angry faces but mostly not caring :3
Yes, who
and eating fish n chips* because i am right now.
yeah, although so many brits don't give 2 shits about the royal family
in fact a lot actively hate it
I, for one, love them. oops ;D
...Have you ever tried to make a royal guard laugh?
who hasn't
4I'm a little surprised that more than a few Brits disliked the ceremony
I'm from europe and if it weren't for the special movies I wouldn't even notice 4th of July
I failed. It's a lot more awkward than it looks
12Hehe I have that in my favs XD
To us it's really just
4But why? I mean, I understand why Great Britain advertised and PR'd it as a "great" event or whatever because it's Britain, one of the oldest nations on Earth. So, why hate it?
"Firework Day"
the Britain on TV != the Britain I see every day : / it's a horrible, hate-filled mess of chavs and scummy lowlifes
Are you cockney? :>
/me falls on ground randomly
they only care about themselves and sit there chiding the royal family going 'well what do they do for us, they're a waste of tax money, ra ra ra' when they have no idea that shitloads of national income comes from royal-related tourism :P
basically, idiots dude. My country is mostly idiots
4Oh
4I see
I'm from poshland, the Home Counties
4I still want to visit Britain some day
dude do it
4I plan on it
I'll take you to some badass cathedrals
4...what kind of cathedrals?
I was in Britain twice
I saw some rocks
some motherfucking awesome cathedrals
and some cliffs. we have lots of cliffs
4I lol'd more than I should have at Apok
Including stonehenge. It was the solstice so I could go close to the rocks
there were many people smoking pot there...
Apokalipse, slight herdmind there lol. so many rocks.
Oh yes, I saw cliffs to!
cliffs!
Fucking love cliffs
wb
To be honest they were impressive cliffs
10Thanks
4When I do go to England, I HAVE to go to Beachy Head
Actually that's where I was...
http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/
what else is there, aside from the usual herpderp 'buckingham palace, nelson's column' etc
I'll think
Old houses
4Apok was at Beachy Head?
Yeah
4Very nice, was it quiet there?
beachy head isn't that in east sussex
http://i.imgur.com/BsMw5.jpg
hold on, talking to myself lol
I guess... I don't remember actually
(talking to myself, accidental post)
4I have this feeling that Beachy Head is abnormally quiet
Hey sprinkles
I have a feeling I'm going to Uni right near there
I was in a hotel that was supposedly haunted... oooooh
you jelly?
4Yes
4I jelly for Beachy Head
I was to France too. They also have cliffs
and cheese
4Mmmm cheese
and crepes
4I also wanna visit Italy
I was there just last week
4Specifically, the country side. Or whatever passes for a country side there
Italians are loud
France is great
the French are obnoxious from what I've seen, but I love the language, the country and the culture
12Right all the chat awards have been done
The French didn't seem obnoxious to me
I guess it also depends where in France you go
4Maybe not to Apok
they always speed up when you cross the roads in inappropriate places :P
7:)
lol
4I wonder if we're still in debt to them over the Statue of Liberty
4Pfft, greatest country
more like not
OBJECTION
4And you think every other country in the world hates us? We hate us too
Britainland is best country
12Now back to figuring this gallery prob out..
We pretend to every other country that we're ok and everything's fine, and when people like Obama visit we just lock the youths and scumbags in cages for a few days
Really we're fucked
4RBD, go say what you said over on Ponychan
4And then sit back for the laughs
which part? D:
4 /oat/ trollface.jpg
/me 7blinks.
no i meant which part of what i said:3
7No, Steam, I am currently not in TF2 right now. :|
You guys are both jelly of Slovenia because we have.... err... something... I guess
heh
4Slovenia?
4What's that?
so much rage
apparently it's a country
it's one of those little ones that people use in quizzes
They say I live in Slovenia, but I failed to find it on the map
4o.o didn't even know it's a country
4What part of the Earth is located?
4I'm assuming Europe
It's next to Italy
east of it
4But still in Western Europe?
central europe
4Oh
or so I'm told
4*nods*
Walmart has more employees as there are people in Slovenia lol
4Man, that's sad
http://i.imgur.com/SNSE7.jpg
@ghosties
I don't mind. Really the country being small is not a problem. The problem is that the politicians are complete idiots
4Scale of 1-10?
4About a 12
scale of 1 to jelly
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130980727563.jpg
^lol
4So, super extra jelly
fair
4*Rainbow Dash pout*
:3
I'm not jelly. We have caves here. Obviously caves are bad ass
We have caves
best caves
4Huh, there's a place called Wolverhampton
4Sounds neat
The longest cave system in the UK is the Easegill System in the Yorkshire Dales, with at least 72 km (45 mi) of passageways.
Wolverhampton is a shithole
We have karst caves. You be 'td aen know what that is probably, so it must be bad ass
all football hooligans and retards
7Anyway, I'm lagging again.
7I'll talk to you guys later. o3o
damn you keyboard
4Football..soccer, yes?
You don't even know what that is probably*
Handegg != Football = soccer
4Yeah yeah
4I got it :P
:D
4Hell
4I don't even like sports
4Except for two
4Skateboarding and snowboarding
4Fucking love those
6...
in fairness, me neither. EXCEPT TENNIS ALASDGHALKDG WIMBLEDON WAS GREAT
Fucking love tennis
Proper lawn tennis though
4*shrugs*
bastard :P
4Tennis is fun on video games?
it is
4I mean
12WAAAIT
4It's basically pong
4But whatever
pong in 3d :D
what's more to life?
12Check the fan art gallery and tell me if you have moderator access?!
10Hm?
4With models and people and more textures
Heya DRF
mario tennis
ftw
/me does the Safety Dance
I used to be into X-Pogo
4X-Pogo?
with a few peeps i knew from your country, used to hang on a forum
Extreme Pogo sticking
...ooooook
4Extreme
4pogo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BkB8dsauow
4sticking
4lolwut
4Good song
just picked first vid i found, ill dig up a proper good one if you care enough
jake and nick are good lads though
6...I hate the new /oat/
6It made me lose my battle.
6;-;
4See?
4I told you most people were gonna complain :/
:>
4...sorry, Sprinks
I don't go on ponychan, so I have no idea what you're talking about
4You know you're mah bro
what purpose does /oat/ serve?
4Probably nothing after the cleanup
practically none now haha
4It'll be filled with nothing but party threads most likely, and it'll become a crapssacharine board
what purpose <i>did<i> it serve?
oh right no html ha
it was randomness abound
4More like, it was where all the drama/gossip/mudslinging/internal politics took place
:3
So what happened now?
4Ergo, it was the most interesting and entertaining
4!!RainbowDash mod decided to clean up the board
nothing non-pony basically
4And it caused a massive shitstorm between him and users
and he moved oat users to /chat/ so that pissed chat off
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/079d4c9c-4e37-4228-983f-1806ac525440.png
4Yep
4So now
4You have /chat/ regulars and /oat/ people in closed quarters
Everypony hates everypony else? :3
"It's safe to dance!"
LOL XD
4So if you wanna know where all the shit's gonna go down, go to /chat/
Doesn't sound like love and tolerance to me
4PFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
4Love and tolerance is just a motto
03http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/demotivational-posters-fail.jpg
4Some users actually believe in it, and I kinda respect them for it
4Moony, Amonisis...
4But other people?
4Nah
Can a Creeper destroy that?
6god yes
6I would rage if one did though
Yeah, I can see how love and tolerance wouldn't work all around, but surely people can strive towards it?
12WHY is KFC always on TV when I am hungry
Is that right?
4I'm just waiting for the day when I log onto Ponychan and the front page will read "Ponychan...ponychan has changed." And then wait for /chat/ and /oat/ to say the same thing but replace Ponychan with their names.
4And then proceed to find the closest thread which will read "BAWWWW, REMEMBER THE GOOD OL DAYS"
4Because that's all Ponychan really is
4Just round table discussions and cliques
4Sorry about that, went into a mini rant :D
I only posted on ponychan about 5 times
03http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/job-fails-society.jpg
4Anyways
03I know I pasted this but different people are on now XD
So I don't really care all that much
Ghosties, don't ever think you can't rant to us dude. We're your bros, it's our job to help you come to terms with stuff and talk about how you feel about stuff exactly like this
>:#
It's what we do
;p
4Not sure how to respond to that, RBD
;p
Just brohoof me dude
I like rants
4Brohoof
10Colon p
6Ghosties, you should totally buck the discussion thread.
/me brohoofs
good stuff
4Should I, Sprinkles?
10Semicolon*
4I think I will
o dot o
03^ approved
4There, it's been bucked
4Hmmm...let's see what /oat/ looks like now
6Looks like a bomb hit and all that's left are appreciation threads.
Ohai Espeon
4I thought the clean up wasn't to be till tomorrow
12Skylands? D: can you please check the Sprite gallery for me? XD
12Are you logged into it..?
4I guess the regulars up and outright left /oat/
6The cleanup was today.
4 /chat/ is such a...odd place to see right now
6There's an image of a bunch of threads being moved.
4Where?
10Hang on
6I didn't save it...
6And I stopped watching the thread it was in...
10Yep
12You are?! Awesome..
6It was "REMEMBER 4/7/11" XD
4I'm so tempted to do a "/oat/.../oat/ has changed..."
4thread
12Uh oh
12it's not picking up your display name..
12Hi Articuno
10lol AngelicLugia
6Should do one and see how long it takes to get moved.

12So now you can logout/in with the gallery too!
I wish I had a pogo stick :(
02I'm already logged in, that's how it's gonna stay lmao.
02So Feather, I read that Pinkie Pie Cupcakes story.
13Oh, Arti, I've uploaded more than 10 pictures to the art gallery. Just sayin' ;3
108D
13and I'll remember to upload all other new pictures to the gallery too <3
02And then it dawned on me
02That Pinkie Pie sounds just like one of my characters
fff im afk
10:o
I had to sell my good one, I still have a ghetto one i modded out of two kids pogo sticks
those were the days
02I don't have many picture I'm proud of to upload to the gallery :/
12^
10lol same here
02So now Feather
10plus I haven't been drawing much Pokemon
02I must draw my character in Pinkie Pie's room
10DO IT
12Ok thanks Angel XD
02And dedicate it to you for giving me the link to that story :U
02Course that will have to be after I finish my comic pages
12Awarded
02Feather
13:3 Thanks~
13Lol I get all giddy when I see those awards, no idea why |D
02I just tell myself I'm not gonna get any more than what I have.
06giddy :3
02And then go on with life
02Pessimism~
13!espeon
13asdfg
06lies
06silly vars
12That pic of you and Xeli is like, seriously the best
12I die everytime I see it
6brb guys, going across the street for food or something, and I'm not leaving my comp here during rush hour.
/me is still surprised
But ohwell
13Really? I don't think it's one of my best, in fact I see loads of errors xD
10I don't <3
/me curls up on Feather's head
12Me neither, I think it IS one of your best ovO
02Maybe I'll upload my Deino
02For Feather
Hello
06I'm clearly rather biased, but I think the same! :p
10:D
02I'm sure you haven't seen it
13LOL, thanks a lot~ <3
02I don't even know if you watch me on dA or not anymore XD
4 /oat/…/oat/ has changed. It’s not about shipping, or GET battles It’s not even about oatmeal, or Pinkie Pie parties, or love threads.
4It’s an endless series of ‘how are you’ threads Propagated by the users who remained in /oat/ after the cleanup that swept through.
4 /oat/, and its vast disappearance of drama and mudslinging, Has become a rational, hollowed-out image of what it once was.
4 /oat/ has changed.
lol ghosties
4That's what I've got so far
magical
4:P
13ohai Cheese :3
02There we go
4I think I may need to change the GET part though, since I'm still seeing them on /oat/
they shouldn't be though
right?
4In fact, I bet GET threads will stay there because !!Celestia advocates them
ha
hopefully inb4 mod conflict!
that would be lulzy
4Here's how I see it, if GET threads are moved then the BMN selection threads will be moved also
4But then
10I do if you were talking to me Shiny
10XD
4This won't be bad for us
02I never know lol
4Because it seems that there's a lot more traffic over on /chat/
BMN is about ponies?
GET is about GET.
7You got my message in PM, Feather?
so, I'll be on here for the next day or so
4Originally, the BMN selection threads were on /oat/ but were then moved to /chat/ because they weren't "pony" enough for /oat/
backing up my main Windows hard drive and then reformatting XD
oh really
:/
4Yep
My perception of 'pony enough' must be feebly inaccurate
How is BMN not pony?
4We then had to argue our claim over on /meta/ to the mods of Ponychan to get them to allow us to stay on /oat/
4Because BMN is mostly about movies
4and just a little about ponies
Hello
i guess :)
4But even so, GET has absolutely NOTHING to do with ponies
although we're all here because we like ponies
02,0,
02.-.
and look at my name
4And I guess the mods understood that and allowed us back on /oat/
(it's like ponies)
It's a site for bronies to watch movies
4Right
we reference ponies all the time
4But the mods didn't see it that way at first
Most of the preshow is pony videos
pony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljPFZrRD3J8
Wait, why am I saying this since we all know this
Horses = Braveer = that link
apok, you can vent your frustration to us in their misunderstanding of BMN xD I get what you mean dude
12!Pokemon
12!pokemon
Lati, you are a 8Simisear.
12noooooo
02I see, so we do have to wait until it's approved
13!pokemon
12Hiya Lati :3
13no
/me sighs
06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 8Lapras.
4That's all true, but our main priority is movies
OW MY EYES
4Ergo, not ponies
I forgot mibbit can't disable orange like mIRC can :/
inderdaad i get you
4I think that's what the mods saw
13oh dear
/me gives Espeon a crown
02!pokemon
/me fancy
!pokemon
drf|PartedMagic, you are a 4Pignite.

so HML get this
06Gabenite
02!pokemon
Hmm?
for some reason, my motherboard refuses to let me boot CDs
I had to spend a while making a Parted Magic flash drive
What? LOL
since the CDs I burned didn't work
>_>
Ouch
That mobo sucks
well
12How are you, Lati?
it's actually pretty awesome
02I keep forgetting today's the 4th of July lmao
12 SATA ports, 6 USB 3.0 ports, XD
it's just being dumb about booting from CDs
12!Pokemon
10weird
but yay Parted Magic flash drives?
you can actually make them using Windows
10Sorry about that
10and no it hasn't
if you google unetbootin
it can download and create the files for you :P
10*Cynderpoke*
4The next time I see Combustiblelemons, I'm going to ask him if the cleanup in /oat/ was due to him
6:P
:o
4Or, at the very least, part of the reason
4for the cleanup
Yeah, I tried to
Might as well explain the situation surrounding him, it's not like /oat/ is going quickly today ;)
But I have no flash drives :P
6Is V1RU5 some kind of mod person or something?
and I've got all day :P
12Wb
(I have my P-M liveCD in my laptop right now )
/me noms on Feather's head
02thanks
10eep
Note to self: the drive I'm backing files up to is 00J2GB0
should be the 4th of 5 RAId drives
12bbl

02Feather
You
What O.o
12Ah
02Lmao
4But I'm gonna ask him if he was the one that made that thread last night on /oat/ about how /oat/ wasn't the same or something
10ya?
12XD
FailPM

12Skylands still there?
I want a snickers bar
I am jelly
ohoho well let me check what i have and see if I can 1-up
4L of pepsi max, some Peach Passion tic-tacs, a bag of Haribo Starmix, and some Cadbury's Chocolate Fingers
6Snickers beats all of that.
6I also have Diet Green Tea.
Why is that not being digested yet?
Apok because I just finished my lunch
6Because I was eating the OTHER Snickers.
12Anyone?
:3
10Meep
12Yay!
im here ;p
12I'm going to set you as a gallery mod for a sec
10Testing something?
12Tell me if you see admin controls in the gallery
12yep
and sprinks maybe your snickers does win. but have you ever had this?:
12Try now ^^
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hR7F-MqvRzI/TTwt73YOcPI/AAAAAAAALbc/3hdmrLwGQT4/s1600/snickmax1.bmp
i dont know if you get it in the states
10I see them
12Brilliant
instead of the layer below the caramel, it's ALL caramel and peanuts
6I've had one, though I've never seen them in stores...
12That's that sorted
they're amazing, and every store here has them :3
that's my no.1 chocolate bar at the moment
12Now, I'm appointing Aurora as a gallery mod to help sort out the images, I'm taking away admin approval as there will now be three of us working on it so we shouldn't need it ^^
10Am I keeping these privileges? :P Not that I visit the art gallery often, I could try my best to visit more often
here's a question by the way (one that doensn't even matter that much, but hey)
4I have Combos
12lol sorry ^^;
12Was just a test
12Although
4Buffalo Blue Cheese combos
12As a global I could probably set that up for you..
10Nah, that's what I meant
10I don't really want them LOL
12Oh XD
12Ok XD
10that's not what I meant* Blah, typos
4Stay British, makes you awesome
12Who here likes GRIMER?
Whatever you prefer
does it mater?
matter*
well I like trying to adapt to your language, it's fun
(not yours apok, too hard)
lol
but I could just collapse back to british and keep it as a defining point of RainBroDash himself :p
10not sure
10weird users have been poping up
6I saw him on here yesterday I think too..
6:O
I so want you to speak slovenian now
it would be hilarious
:D I can do french
6Btw,has Icy been on lately?
that's about it
4What kind of shops do you have over there?
4>mfw I said shops instead of stores
XD
and that's a tad broad dude
4Ah
4Convenience shops?
xD
4Oh dear
we have corner shops broski
4Aha! Yes, that
because of our silly roman roads, there are corners everywhere
4Those places where you can get snacks and beverages
4Places that aren't pubs
so all the immigrants came along, stole the corners and set up shops there:)
and condoms
4>mfw I said pubs instead of bars
6I'm waiting for somepony to join the stream...
what, sprinks?
06Mhm, good night o.o
/me shoots Lati
Night Xeli
13And goodnight x3
6I'm waiting for somepony to come on the page... anypony.

06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 2Torterra.
10!pokemon

12!POKEMON
Lati, you are a 9Luxio.
10decent
Mine's done that more than normal recently
06... better than Grimer, but we all know that it lies
06THIS
02Probably not the best thing lmao
like, last few weeks
12the poses are really fluid..
02.-.
6Mine hasn't been doing that..
12they look natural
4WhatPayne, do you come from Ponychan?
12yes...grimer...and lies.
12I envy that, mine are ridgid and fake..
it's manageable, and probably because I watch 3 livestreams at once along with lots of facebook and youtube tabs
my computer just trolls me
What? No... Just decided to check if anythings up :/
ohai, I'm going to freeze up now. See you in about an hour
4Oh, no, nothing right now
13!pokemon
4Not until Friday
13Moooo
12Bulls
Figured that :)
02I think it's because you're working with more human-like anatomy Arti
12are male wannabe cows
Sprinkles, are you streaming right now?
4Thanks for stopping by, though
6EPIC SAX SPIKE
LOLWHAT
I HAD NO IDEA
4Oh
4we are streaming
4Will ya look at that
mega head bobbinh
bobbing
yeah I've been listening to epic sax spike now for a little while
No problem... Is that looping feed you have going on?
6I'm just leaving it on because I like Epic Sax Spike.
*facehoof
4Osha-Hello
4Most likely, WhatPayne
02Hi Chao
It's tattoo'd in my brain by now
6It's on loop on youtube, I've got it streaming live.
12Osha-wott!
/me runs
4You know
Well at least it's epic sax.
/me 4chases
4I think epic sax Spike should be our "Off air" signal
6It will be for about a month.
4Instead of just "closing time"
with an off-air watermark
6Then we'll switch to something else.
6...also, that would be epic.
that bulge though. I can't look
6If I could figure out how to do that...
12aww the stretchy yellow man's finger has been cut off
12I didn't do it
12<< >>
4Maybe Silver or dari know how
6Or DCD
02But I'm already owned
just poke dari with a stick with a note on the end of it saying what he needs to code :D
4Yeah
Is there anything else you can stream right now? Not to be rude or anything
02So you can't catch me
12I'm the gingerbread man!
12LOL
lol@bane NO :D
13I read that as "can't touch me"
Oh yeah... You guys planning on doing any special occasions like this past weekend in future?
13then a certain song played in my head
13.w.
4Yep
4lawl
4But that's a secret
12You can't touch this ;o
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ooh... can't wait.
oh for f-
just looped hahaha
02:P
4wow
4i guess i can't
:P
6I'm looking for something else to play for a bit...
/me has had epix sax spike muted for a while, because a stream he was watching was playing smooth jazz
/me 4flees
stop trying to catch people :P
4NEVER!!!!!!!!!
6I wonder if that worked...
12GONNA!!!!!!!
Whoa... Stop everything. Ghosties said secret. Curiosity level went up by 500%
6I've never tried resizing the window while streaming...
*insert rickroll* :p

7And...
4I didn't know what he was talking about but didn't pay much attention. In any case, he played it and I had decided to unmute my audio
4And then I went back to doing what I was doing
6I'm not a fan of the Kanye, but the visuals for this part are amazing.
6I thought he hated the ponies.. :P
4I heard Pinkie's singing VA come in

6Favorite animated movie.
4Funny
wb
4Alice: Madness Returns was my last 360 purchase
6Why D:?
/me gives Aurora a towel
You know Walt Disney didn't like Alice, he felt he didn't do a good job on it
6That game is amazing.
6I actually didn't get in
6I ate
6xD
4Yes it is
4AURORA IS A LIAR!!!!!!
4And it came with a copy of the original Alice

6ooooook
6I admit it
4:3
6i stuck my feet in while I ate
It only took a chunk out of my hdd
Is the madness any good?
4I didn't know that Lewis Carrol's Alice In Wonderland was based off of a real person until last month
Have you guys played that one old, darker alice on PC?
I misread that as "I suck my feet"
6D:
6I'm eating a lime right now
3.80 GB
and I was like what
6:>
/me 4pokes Aurora's forehead
DD:
6...lol
6ow

Aurora
4I've played it, though for the 360
you know you want to put a lime in the coconut
*wait it is 3.20 lol
6I think I've heard of it but Idk what it is..
6xD
6and shake it all up?
4LotR

I believe it works with FL Studio
6sodabomb

13Kinky

/me shot
/me 4flees
4???
"Drink it, shake it up", I was like LOL WHAT
4my script didn't go through??? o_O
...
there's an ad on the radio right now
for a lawyer
saying he'll help if you get caught drunk driving
Would you recommend Madness for someone who has not played the previous Alice game? But has find the concept art good?
no, just no
LMFAO
if you get caught drunk driving you should go die in a fire
and not even get a trial
/me 4whips his hair back and forth
6Probably.
XD
6wth
4Yes
4I would
6that LAWYER should go die in a fire
He should
4Besides, you get a copy of the original Alice anyways
it reminds me of my friend's lawyer
10[19:15] * ChaoHOTD whips his hair back and forth <- That song *burns it*
4As long as the Madness Returns is a new copy and not used
whose business card had a photocopy of the Monopoly "Get out of jail free" card on the back >_>
I was like ABUSIVE
6Is it sort of like PS or something?
I didn't even know it was available on 360!
anyway
6...
check that out XD
4Yep, it is
6your friend has a lawyer?
Synthesizer

You do? Well thats good... I might get it then.
4NEEDS MORE BANGARANG, SPRINKS
family friend, you know?
4>:I
6oh lol

telling your clients you can get them out of jailf ree
they're in jail for a reason
6inb4 buffer
4I don't think you'll regret it, WhatPayne
6Aa,cool!
Good because I was about to get the Duke Nukem, but apparently that's not so good.
ugh don't get Duke Nukem
6I was highly disappointed in Duke.
4I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AND FORTH! I WHIP MY HAIR BACK AND FORTH!!
/me 4flees
unless you like cheap, crude humour and cheesy lines
10Thanks to you, I'm listening to it now :P

OH GOD YES
6 same ._.
Jon Lajoie has the best songs.
I'm not
and sigh
17 hours left
to copy this hard drive
4good
I may be stuck on Parted Magic for a whuile
*while
4my job here is done
though I'll go use my laptop in a bit
I do find it funny that Parted Magic has XChat on it by default
/me 4goes back to watching some students shoot zombies
/me keeps misreading Parted Magic for Puella Magi
wtf is that
10Anime
6lol
Parted Magic is a Linux system that's designed for cloning hard drives and whatnot
which is precisely what I'm doing
10k
Parted as in GParted partition editor :P
and magic as in... magic
/me hides
6oh yay, I may have found a roommate for school x.x
04Awesome
0420 minutes wasted
6who aparently lives very close to me, even though we're both going to be going to school 6 hour drive from us
6small world much
4geez, my brother his SHOUTING!!!!!!!
4it's annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SO ARE YOUUU
6my brothers always shout
XD
6so I threaten them
LOL
4I'M NOT SHOUTING!!!!!!11
13I have no brothers, so it's my mum who does the shouting in this house :B
/me 7yawns.
4I'M TYPING IN CAPS!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
7Well, I've got an SAT class half of the week starting tomorrow for a good deal of summer.
/me 4just saw a daughter bite her mom
4i'm SO gonna have nightmares
6lol SAT classes
6I can't believe they have classes for that
7Ayup.
I know right
The SAT is easy
just suck it up and take it
6inb4 BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
my mom tried to make me study for the ACT and I was like "you do realize they cover about everything, right?"
6ACT was so annoying
7Eh, parents do want me to get a high score.
6it was horribly easy
SAT is worse
6except the science portion
XD
4Well, get Duke Nukem 3D
6which is infamous for being ungodly
I did alright on it actually
my worst section was English
6same
no surprise there
but I got a 29 overall
both times, too
I took it twice, got the same score LOL
6I got a 29 on the ACT, 1650 on SAT
6...lol
I never even took the SAT
/me 7blinks.
because no schools in Michigan care about the SAT
6yeah i'm amazed you're takig it quan
I took it back in like 8th grade as one of those "Take the SAT early to see what it's like!" things
7Eh, not my decision. :P
6the only places that really care about SAT are here in the west lol
nah, lots of east coast schools require the SAT
...the mod thread just 404'd
6oh really?
yeah
7But I get ~750 on my SAT2s.
east coast does too
6we're always told they want ACT xD
Oh wow. I havem't played that game in really long time.
I dunno
I just know around here it's ACT
7SAT's primary here.
6no one cares about ACT here
yeah
Quany, what colleges were you going to apply to?
7ACT's still acceptable, just less common.
s/were/are?
6why do we have 2 tests then D:
7I have no idea.
Aurora, because two separate companies
if they only had one, people would be like OMFG MONOPOLY and not allow it
>_>
6lol
6There's more blood than a rubber hose bottle of foot!
I wish we could just have a monopoly of Microsoft made OSes, screw Mac
I mean
hi
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You mean our mod thread?
Yeah.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6would make life easy >.>
I know right
Vagina
Well
looks like we need a new one
...why is this not a pony vid yet?
4:O
4That's a naughty word
Monopolies are only bad if they're abusive
Give it time
if it's something like standard software used by companies or something
Hey he said it first
it would be a lot more helpful
6...TF?
same with standardized tests
/me 7is reminded of California in the early 2000s.
7But I digress.
13Well, goodnight all <3
but tell the government that
7Good night, AE>
nii
;p
12Bye Angel :3
7I don't see too much of a point in standardized tests; perhaps to compare education, but not as a prerequisite for college. O.o
7Brb.
who knows
anyway, I need to go for an hour or two.
6I see the point actually
not gonna bother changing my name as I'm still on Parted Magic so yeah
Well I'm off to celebrate Firework Day, see you guys later!
6a college isn't going to waste their time on someone who doesn't care
/me runs
4YAYZ! RANDOM CAPS CHAT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Hey, anyway you can give admin to the rest of us on the steam?
I know I can make you guys officers
Don't know about admin
Good enough.
Alright
Hold on
Oh u DRF :p
anyway bye
Just need to be able to regulate questions and crap without people going "HURRR DURRR HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S REALLY YOU" or something
That's fine
In that case, you may want to change your names to our BMN names
Then again, I'm not or plan to
So
whatever
*shrug* I don't think anypony cares, as long a we're obviously the people running it.
I think I'll hit the sack as well...
6G'night.
Thanks for the evening entertainement... And the game help Ghosties.
My only request is thus: that I be given the controls of the Steam group and all that. I figure since you're doing the Twitter, Silver's doing the email (mostly) and Hip's doing the Facebook I could regulate the Steam group?
4No problem, WhatPayne
I guess I'll keep checking this feed for these unexpected streams. ;)
Well, night.
4Goodnight
Fine by me.
And the only reason I'm doing the twitter is because nopony else seems to want to touch it.
Thanks ^_^ makes me feel all important and stuff :P
It's just nice to have everybody be able to access pretty much everything in case somepony goes away for a bit or something.
Which reminds me... we need to get the color and flood scripts from dari and ask him how to use them.
I know what you mean, and that makes sense
Oh yeah, we do need to get a hold of dari
But you know how difficult that is
That's the main reason I have the links to edit the site, which came in handy today, thank gawd I asked Silver for them.
Indeed
The main reason I didn't even touch that problem is because I have no idea how to work a website
I believe I would have made it worse >_<
hi :)
Hi Jazmyn
:3
:3 any mods about
Disk partitioning is "fun."
I have years of html, so I found the problem almost immediately.
Hipster really needs to get an avatar for his steam account
6Yep.
Yes, he does.
It bothers me that I have to look at ? every time I see his name
ohai sprinks
up to much?
Just to clarify, you're Sprinkleburg, right?
lalalala
4MODS?
4WHERE?
/oat/? :trollface:
Ayep.
4Well now
4I WAS on /oat/ recently
4Just taking a stroll
6I'm on /oat/ now.
Good
through the barren wasteland
hah
6It's so nice and quiet on /oat/...
Have you checked it yet?
>nice
eh?
6See the beautiful bomb-destroyed scenery...
heh
its raining :(
Yep.
4And to think, Sprinks disliked the new /oat/ just hours ago
:((
/me 4breaks the perfect 5 minute silence
4ASDFGHJKL!
4:3
Look good?'
4rock music is too loud
:>
So. Question time.
yay!!
Yep.
4gtg
4bye all
Cool
6I dislike the slowness of new /oat/.
brb
How many possible new mods have you interviewed so far, how many are you doing in the near future, and how many do you hope to take on as new mod positions?
4o.o
(if any of that is classified, ignore me)
6It makes GETting a pain due to random jumps every now and then when you aren't expecting them.
4OUT OF FUCKING LEFT FIELD
4We've interviewed...about 7?
:D:D inappropriately detailed question time is srsbzns
4I think?
6A lot.
6A few.
6And a very few.
4THOUGH I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FIRST INTERVIEW
4ALWAYS
6In that order.
hah Ghosties, explain?XD
6We will never forget that interview.
6Can't.
6Classified.
and thanks sprinks, at first I was like >ask Sprinks 3 questions, get one shitty answer, but thanks :3
it's cool
4Mod/user confidentiality and all that
but sounds ruddy hilarious
d:
sorry if I keep delving into the whole mod thing frequently, it's just playing on my mind xP
6Hopefully we get more mods soon.
6Lord knows I could use somepony else to make do a lot of the work I do.
/me hugs Feather
4>make do a lot of the work I do
7Speaking of...
4*stares*
/me jumps around, hoof in the air shouting 'ME, PICK ME, I LIKE MENIAL TASKS'
7Feather, how's that download? :P
6...what?
4Exactly
6Can't say I'm not honest.
4I was implying that the sentence looked oddly structured
6It was oddly structured.
4Thus
4The stare
6But that's what happens when you haven't slept in... 59 hours.
4Dude
4-_- get some sleep, Sprinks
4We're not streaming for another few days
/me 7blinks.
/me 7sees a glitch in the sprite gallery.
/me 7logs in/out.
it's fine dude D: technically. although a synonymous phrase for 'use somebody' would make the correctness more obvious; as in "I could do with someone else to make do a lot of the work I do'
7Darn it, it's still there. O_o
in a grammatical sense it's fine. It's just a bit untidy
4That still looks weired
4gah
:(
4weird
4too many 'do's in there
4Two is the acceptable limit
4THREE IS JUST OVERBOARD
6Dododo dododo dododo dodo dodo do dodo dodo dodo.
my spoken english is fubar. I end up overusing the passive and shit goes crazy
I tried too hard as a kid and it stuck :3
4I have a question for you two
ohrly
4NO USING THE INTERNET FOR HELP EITHER
im interested now
*closes all other tabs
4Sprinks, are you listening?
6THE ANSWER IS 42
4NO
4YOU LOSE
FUUUU
>by default RBD wins
*yes*
4How do you pronounce the word "ghoti"?
4Sprinks, no internet help
6...tf kind of word is that?
/me would say like ghost and roti, would probably be wrong though, since otherwise this isn't an interesting question...
4It's a word commonly used by English professors to discuss irregularities in the English language
4So, no, RBD, it's not pronounced that way :P
;)
do i get points for predicting the wrong answer?
4...no?
fuck
4Why would I give you points for guessing wrong?
6...I've seen that word before methinks...
wait, give me a few minutes to think about it
4Alright
I swear im not looking it up...
4I think I'm gonna make this a thread on /chat/
4After you guys are done
I'm just trying to decipher the fucking root. This bitch is NOT from a romance root...
6I REMEMBER WHERE I'VE SEEN IT!
6A GAME OF HANGMAN!
I dominate hangman
6...now to remember how the FAWK to say it.
I destroy everyone I play at it :3
usually* eeeep, im gonna play someone now and lose
damn it
literally the only languages I know are romance languages. so I have no fucking clue whatsoever
6You should hear me making fucking weird sounds...
4XD get on skype
6TO SKYPE LAND!
>inb4 this is a word of romance descent and I'm so totally wrong I deserve to die
12back
7WB.
12Thanks
if you guys are ending it, can i google it and get google to say it to me?
4Not sure yet
lol what's skypename?
4I want to know if Sprinkles is gonna skype how he's pronouncing the word
everdownward
ohh you're asking how he's pronouncing it
02Downloading the first Skin mod pack

DEAR GOD NO ONE CARES ;_;
SNEAS
ih
so
how's everyone's Independence Day?
About?
what cone says :P
Nobody cares about Linux either :>
/me hides
12／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
Nobody cares about Kyubey
XD
you'd be surprised
12Linux is epic
4Sup Silver
If you want to do nothing easy, sure ;D
Epicly silly at times too :p
12Have you used Linux before, HML? XD
6Oh hey Silver, when'd you get here?
Yes derp :p
you only don't like it because you don't know how to use it ;p
4It appears just recently
But I didn't see it as useful
So, why do I need to know how to use it :p
how is it not useful?
12Ah, well in my opinion, it’s pretty useful
Well, useful for everyday use
:P
oh hai guise
Only for one off jobs
6Has he... said anything?
6And hi RainBro.
4Nope, hi RainBro
12I feel more at home with windows though
soup
still on skype sprinks?
Doesn't every normal person? :P
Just line any other day.
Of course, running Linux only programs and looking through thousands of distros for something you want is a bit silly and annoying :P
/me has been playing TF2 all day.
even I, an Apple understander, like Windows better than Mac
Except I can't watch movies in peace.
lol
Like, even.
4That reminds me, I should at some point arrange a BMN TF2 session
about two or three poeple drove by with loud booming music
Why? :o
12[20:05] <Pattyrick> even I, an Apple understander, like Windows better than Mac <-- We were talking about Linux XD
I know
6I need to be able to get on Steam first...
So far I'm good with Heavy, Engineer, and Medic.
gave me a headache
So, Linux and Mac fall under "Non-windows" or widely adopted OSes too :P
I've used Linux once, but I didn't get to see much of it
It's interesting looking through the various distros
because you pick out new things and learn
4Well, obviously not right now :P
4But at some point in the future
Well I'd like to pick one thing that everyone else uses and writes programs for :P
Plus way more tech support
6...and Silver left...
4Yup
who needs tech support?
12ლ(◔◡◔ ლ)
and no, more programs are written for linux :pp
:p
12Espeon comes up with the best faces
Agreed
12What's up? :3
7Ioulaum has broken dA again.
Nothing much
hi Patty
/me yawns
Gparted > parted magic
o-o
How much stuff is included in the distro? :P
03gparted is a program
03parted magic is an entire distro
03and keep in mind
03I don't even use gparted usually
Ah :p
03I'm using clonezilla right now
03that has its own distro, but why have like 50 CDs lying aroujnd when parted magic does it all
;P
10Meep
Heya Sky~
:3
I think I'm the only one who doesn't know what distro means, right?
10Hi Domino :3

WB DRF
hm
WB Feather
and wb Feather :D
10thanks
anyway, I need to find a good quality logo of Parted Magic
I'm gonna buy a custom Parted Magic flash drive from pexagonm
-m
it's a site that will do personalized flash drives for a reasonable price
like $10 for a 2GB
12Hi Feather
I made one with an Ubuntu logo and then put Ubuntu on it xD
4Anyone on?
Nope
HML
Are you like
:trollface:
following my pastebin or something?
12Feather~
What?
10hI~
sprinks has gone out for a smoke
Not really
10*hi~
LOL
I only look at it when you paste links LOL
Parted Magic can be used to hack Windows accounts
and erase their password
s
/me 6sits on Feather
Cool O.o
6rararararararararararar
I'm blasting insane drum n bass in an HD gaming headset. Turns out this was a great idea
so can linux in general
zipzipzipzipzip
and that may be true
but eh
parted magic IS linux
I know
it's the programs on it that make it special
so yeah :p
especially clonezilla
yeah
heh
you can't install that normally
you have to do all this crap
I looked on how to install it on ubuntu
well
4Thank god my neighbors aren't blasting their bass this evening
it was like a 4 page guide
on it
the general process for installing something on linux
is basically
wget craphere && tar xvzf craphere && cd craphere && ./configure && make && sudo make install
baha. I think that's what MY neighbours are saying right now. Except they mean tonight, and by tonight they mean 4:17am
LOL wget
you could also use a browser
6Back
wb sprinks
true but I'm lazy
and I'm more use to shells and crap
I <3 my boxes
Velveeta with shell noodles
I even have one with RHEL on it
4I will guarantee you that Hipster has posted in every single thread on /meta/ while at least being in the last three shown posts for at least half of the threads on the front page
XD
I have like
10-15 linux boxes
and 3 windows servers
o-o
aww, no botnets?
He was on the front page 5 times last I checked
I lost my login for the one I had one on
/me hides
hm
*in the most recent posts that appear
apparently Mibbit uses the system time
as my computer thinks it's 3:19am right now
yeah it does
when it's only 11:19pm
nearly everything does
I just dont' care
because this is partedmagic
hm
?
is there a way
via linux cli
to change system time
and I mean
actual hardware
like the chip on the motherboard
that keeps the time
time timehere or something
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6fezelfJzw
hmb
because
for some stupid reason
hm
oh
my Droid's time is like 3 hours off
my computer's motherboard probably got damaged while being shipped here to Italy
6The html is making me cry right now...
well
it changes itself when it gets the correct time from Verizon
you need to edit a file
but if I use the backup manager
just for your audiophilic enjoyment
which is completely independent of the wireless
it gets the times wrong
:/
and @sprinkles lol
hm
what file
or you can use date
but date is like
I don't want to date my phone
I only date people
LOL
which brings up?:
-?
Carbon dating
sounds gross
lmfao
well
guys
I need a favor
from someone who's good with art
date monthdatetime
like Aurora or somebody
so
date 07051322
http://partedmagic.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&media=desktop.png
see that logo
the circular one with the stars
to change the date to the 5th of july, 1:22pm
I need that isolated
if that makes sense
o.o
and a lot bigger
4What genre is this?
6what
/me 6reads conversation
http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Parted-Magic-4-4-Adds-Dial-Up-Networking-and-Sound-Support-2.jpg
bigger source
biggest I can find
I dunno if it's possible to like, trace over it or sometihng
6isolated....meaning you want just that logo?
right
with a clear or white background

6oh
yeah well
150x150
is very small
:/
6how big do you need it
http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html @ drf
uh
maybe like twice that size? 300x300 or so?
Shiny
there?
02hmm?
6http://www.artrinsic.com/files/gimgs/11_partedmagic02.jpg
the artist calls it DNBStep
6something like that wont work will it?
it's practically drum n bass
that's a different picture LOL
but yeah
what I'm trying to do though
is find the actual image file on the filesystem
as I'm sure it exists
it's dirty as fuck, but unlike genres like dubstep which tend to be slower it has that AMAZING hyped up beat from 1:31 onwards
http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems
I so want to do that
god dang it
I hate linux search
lol
it's so awful
I can't even sort by size
linux's search function is actually decent
not the one I'm using o.o
I just pressed F3
I dunno what it opened
6Ghosties

yes...

I just crashed it
tried to open like 50 pictures at once

I mean, the filemanager died

Bawwww :P

6Meh, just decided to do it while I was cleaning up the html. Since Silver did everything on Easy Mode it resulted in spaghetti html, which can result in issues if there's a technical problem... like there was earlier... so, yeah.

:trollface:
Meh, what am I saying, I don't even do HTML and it looked bad.
:D
o_O
6That wasn't even the worst of it, since that's not really spaghetti html, it's just repetitive and unnecessary.
6Spaghetti is when you have million tags intertwined to where it's a pain to find where they begin and end.
6Also, brb
just copypaste into Notepad++ and hover over the tags :3
kk :D
6My Notepad++ is dead. I have to use regular Notepad for things.
D:
6But for when you need something fixed quick, all the copypasting is a pain.
yeah i agree, not trying to undermine the fact that it must have been a bitch to deal with

How do you use the scripts for the color and flood kickers?
In case you aren't able to show again or something.
I wrote the script on mIRC, so you could use it on there, although I'm fairly sure that all proper IRC clients (not mibbit) will work with it too.
/me knows nothing of scripts
lol not mibbit
You just have to copy-paste it into the scripts window.
Well, I've been needing to get a better client for when I'm streaming anyway...
...how would I go about getting mIRC?
02Night everyone
If you know of links, so I don't have to... search for things.
Google mIRC download then click the first link. :P
Ok, fine.
XD
If you don't know offhand I can look.
Since you got inB4 me I'll get you the link. :P
...are you a wizard?
How'd you get it that fast?
Google. :P

Yeah, it has a guilt screen, you never actually have to register though.
You could go get icechat or something else.
I've never used any of the other clients though.
I see a mass kick
on the TF2 server
...well, I'll figure it out later, I suppose.

Hipster's been pushing for /oat/ to be completely random? When did this happen?

I have no idea.
As far as I was aware, Hipster wanted /oat/ and /chat/ to be merged
hey guys what's going on this
oh
I never saw him say anything about wanting /oat/ to be random, but, then again, I don't pay nearly enough attention to /meta/
I have... no idea when this happened.

I just read that thread over on /meta/ where he responded to you
Saying that
*shrug* I don't keep tabs on him, so I personally don't know when he adopted that standpoint.

I think I've pretty much finished up adding to Silver's layout and setting it all up on the site.
03in no way do I endorse you of any kind
same with you :P
02I should yeah. and here in this country where Piracy is legal (LOL). but there is nowhere to learn over here. and learing trough the internet I SOMEHOW end where I started, with no idea of what I'm doind. :P
02doing*
12nini Danny :<
03LOL
03it's not that hard to hack a Wii
03I can help you with it sometime other
03than now
first, get Twilight Princess on Wii
/me shot
03that only works on old ones
02Already did.
02But 4.1 ftl
02It's hard to isntall the IOS's. Tried and failed.
03uh
03you don't need IOSes for pirating
03you just need WAD Manager
02well, IOS to pirate main games for the wii. WAD manager to hack everything else
03well that I can't help with, as I have a modchip
03so I just burn discs and play them
02Well, I could get a modchip. but here they're EXPESIVE as heck.
Can we see a finished result?
03true
03anyway bye\
02Totally not worth it.
Now I just need to finish making that countdown so I can put the on the home page.
Looks great, but you didn't fill out your favorite pony or movie under About Us
I don't have a favourite film.
Favourite pony is Rainbow Dash.
Maybe you should update it
Just a thought ^^
I'll update it, just give me a sec to make something cool.
/me sits on someone's head and wags his tail
Gotcha

also all i play is 50 turn ones XD
12too long

/me 12usually plays 10-15
but with good skill comes mad numbers
Also, random ad-looking links in the middle of blocks of text.
Yeah, Silver put them in.
I dunno why.
i.e. the episode discriptions.
also 2nd highest score is a shocker, 632 in MP4
Oo
That's... random.
aaand with the first highest, i got that in 5 turns XD
I'm doing alright
today was great until I got home and opened my mouth

Pattyrick: Have you heard of Boat to Secret Stage in Super Mario Sunshine? XD
bawwwwwwwwww xinetd is being stupid
I don't think so
you know when you go by the boat theres that little roof that goes over it when it passes by
get a rocket nozzel and charge it jump for it and shoot up
charge for the little roof i mean
12Ah, I've been there before
took me years to just know this XD
i ONLY figured it out during Mario Marathon
12lol
12I think I got ever star in the game XD
I think I've heard of it
I remember
12every*
the guy on the island
you needsa ride Yoshi on the boat without dieing
not that one
or without him dieing, at least
oh
12That game was awesome <3
what's the Sages thing?
ok, when you are in the water under that little tunnel thing, look up, youll see an entrance
you need to rocket up there
or jump when on the boat
hmm
is it a special challenge or something?
its a secret stage
cool
I need to get my disc back from a friend, I think
12o.o
12the poison water ride?
12<late>
Nuuuu

pinball sorta
12o.o
/me 12ish talking about the warp pipe blocked by the yellow...stuff on the island
ahh
yes that takes you to the poison water ride
12difficult to get to, then complete, that one XP
the one by the entrance by Pinna Park cannon (warp pipe on the far side) takes you to a long grass area

snort
is such
a bloody pain
to set up
?
snort IDS/IPS
/me rages
requires SQL, PHP and a whole lot of other crap
/me sets up psad and xinetd instead
12whew
12I've added everyone's last uploaded art to their profiles
12and a link to their galleries on the forum posts
o_O
nice
12It won't show unless you have art
Yeah I figured that
Damn, Articuno, have you ever set up snort? .-.
now I absolutely hate pawns in chess
12No I haven't sorry
Ah okay
I hate it already ._.
I've been up for 24 hours now
