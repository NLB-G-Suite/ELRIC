I'm about the same R-Zack
How dare you, DonAngel
English beer is just as bad
Silvermane: same. I get drunk way too easily for my taste, and I find alcohol to taste sour.
wine is great
6WhiskeyXSirSprinkles=OTP

Hexanol=Best alcohol
lol Yeah it does.
Juuuuden
fuck, Hexanol is real?
8Silver: its not that bad
I had this coctail with gin, coconut cream and sprite in it, it was really good.
Butanol is best
also, gin tonic is probably the best drink effort/taste wise
6It's not that bad if you get good Vodka.
8worst ive had is 151
not Hexanol
uhh yeah silvermane of course it is
8that physically hurt going down

The afterheat is horrible.
6I've had a 4 loko, pretty good.
I heard alcohol is rather pricey in sweden?
cool
How many?
8 4 loko tasted like drinking a battery to me
oh yes it is elky
11Poor Noobs.
but we don't have any other choice
you drank a battery?
that's why they can set the price as high as they want
to drown the sorrows of the long winter nights
We giggled at him
no price is too high
I bought a two VHS set special edition of this at a yard sale
11Hanks just flipped his lid.

8when alcohol is measured in gallons...
you need to walk to the zoo?
I tried all the coctails they had on the menu when I was on holiday, everything with coconut cream in tastes nice. Without fail.
Crowbar, ikr, even I couldn't eat something that fast.

6and if it's too full, I'll dump some
6...
03drain it
6yeh
03right?

03I want a pool XD
6not all of it
6but enough
6this is horrible
03because of liability
03like
03if some kid were to wander into our yard
12Eep, need to make a backup of the DB..
03and drown
03their parents could sue it
03etc
03*sue us
Yeah i know
looool Arti, I haven't done a proper backup for like...a year
12I’ve been starting to not like cold weather ; ;
12:/
I'm that lazy
6>killing civilians isn't fair
12That thankfully doesn't happen in this country but people are already trying it DRF
wat
seriously, drf?
03yes
6um
._.
03that's how america works
6I've read MUCH worse war crimes by other countries that just were dismissed because it wasn't OMFG A NUKE
was
03I should do that, I need money
/me runs
awt
wat
.-.
03LOL, Arti
6that's why there are regulations about gate/fence security
6strict ones
6I didn't even know how strict
03It made this G4 program
03on world's sexiest TV shows
6War is a necessary turmoil.
03nobody ask why I'm watching it ;p
!efg America
6certain distance from the pool
6etc
lol I need to remove that
o_o
there is no war in equestria
Yeah but think about it without war we would have over populated a long time ago
*kicks it*
12haven';t seen it no
6No CURRENT war in equestria.
>|
6Lunar went batshit, remember?
jejeje
12But Hmm, the law to beat the crap outa burglars here is being strengthened :3
timing haha
03Articuno
12If a burglar comes in, you're allowed to kick the crap outa them till they leave or even kill them if they're trying to kill you
6I like that law lol
12What?
03that police officers in the UK can't have guns
6but something like that is allowed here
03I'm like
>|
And alot of our technology came from wars or at least competitions
03so if the cops can't have guns
12We don't need guns
03all that does is make them die
12But some do have them
6so you can use defensive force
6even if it's deadly
12we have other weapons
03such as
03?
kung fu fighting!
/me hides
03tasers have a limit to how far you can shoot them
12Stun guns, which work fine for most crims here. But.. when police are out of force with dangerous people, they do have guns
12the police were fully armed XD
We thrive when when we have someone to compete with
03well all I read was that the police in the UK couldn't carry gunso.o
12Seeya NS
bai NS
03that's totally a stereotype
12I've seen a million reports AND videos of police using unreasonable force
03every bullet fired from a police's gun has to be documented in an official report
12Not a stereotype, videos like that come up on Fark all the time :/
12True
12Yeh and the government always favours the police
03no they don;'t
12They SAY it was reasonable and are let off all the time
Dodge Bullet, Americas newest sport :D
/me shot
03I'm like, is it THEIR fault that YOU are breaking the law?
12US cops fail sometimes :/
03that's an extreme example
wat
03let me put it this way
12but that KEEPS happening
12I read fark news all the time and every week there's something else XD that jsut DOESNT happen here, ever
we are raised to be violent but we could be raised diferently
03America is a much bigger country than the UK
03For every cop that shoots someone
03there's a few million that dn't
03*don't
12DRF
6wtf kind of statement is that
12If you take the same area
12and the same population
6We're raised to be violent? Really?
12and count up all the police crimes there..
12It amounts to the same
6I'm pretty sure I was punished in school whenever I got in a fight...
03I'm just saying there are a lot more police in the US than there
12and yes
03so of course there are going to be more that do stupid things
03as more = more
12But still, there are just.. too many reports..
12One is too many
03if there's anything I've learned
03it's that news ;always exaggerates everything
And besides it wouldn't help in the long run
03every single news anything in existance
12Videos don't exaggerate
03Articuno
03that you would believe it?
good night
6LOLfox
03because they show the same sorts of videos as anyone else
03:P
03LOL
03I doubt news stations edit their videos
they do :P
03yes, sadly there are a lot of crooked cops in America
03but even if the cops weren't allowed to have guns
03if they're CORRUPTED
03would that stop them from having one?
6I try to think of it this way
12No but
03it's like that statement, passwords only keep honest people out
6what would crime be like around here if they didn't have guns
6I don't think UK has the same ridiculous amount of crime like we do
12That's the scary thing About America XD
12Nope
03Laws are completely stupid if peopole don't follow them
6so as horrible as it is, I'd rather the police have their guns on them
6beesides
12It's just scary that you need guns
6It's just nature.
03well
speed limits :3c
6there's FAAAAR more good cops than bad
03Articuno
03if someone comes up to you with a gun
03and you don't have a gun
03say goodbye
03LOL
6That's just the way the foodchain is.
6Eat or be eaten.
12Like I said, people here don't have guns XD
03well then that's fine
on guns i believe gun possession shouldn't be a right
12Only the gangsters do LOL and you never see them, unless you're involved XD
03but that won't stop bad people from giving them
Outsmart or die
03yeah
03see
6in my part of the country
03Rifles or shotguns, sure, I don't care
03as you can actually hunt with those
there is a diference between survible and killing to feed yourself and going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's
03BUT WHY THE F*** IS IT LEGAL TO OWN HANDGUNS
12No idea :/
i think it should be a privilege
03heck
12I agree, handguns wtf
like hunting itself or fishing is certain areas
in*
03it's legal to own assault rifles too
03which is just stupid
x.x i hate gun talk
need a license
12LOL Assault rifles XD
12change of subject then
please
12LOL
03SilverSonic
6Which is generally put forward as being wrong in society.
12I got distracted, need towork
03wait
03no
12*to work
03so do you
/me runs
;p
03yes it is Zoroark
6"going nuts and killing a bunch of mf's" is due to being, well, not sane.
03that being said it was cool
well i guess it would be
03but I was like, this feels illegal
03XD
6No.
i think it's illegal to carry one
6You get medals for doing the right thing.
03probably
03well
12MLP >v>
03owning and carrying are separate
yeah
12What is there to talk about XD
03THANK YOU ARTICUNIO
i know
drf with a gun infront of a pony...hmm.....
/me RUNS
03-I
6Going batshit and killing those that are unarmed is a war crime.
6If they can't fight back, don't fight them, really.
12Ok well I don't get it XD
i think
03indeed
6I didn't realize how consumed the forum is
i dunno lopl
6I like it, yes, but I hate how popular it is
12LOLOL
uh
12Republicans are pro a lot of things we hate as well XD
12But that's another story
12It's all about the lesser of two evils remembver that XD
03Yeah
03see
12All politicians are idiots
^
03I honestly hate all..yeah
12XD
03I just tend to agree iwth republicans more
03Republicans are known as liberal, yes?
03liberal = freedom
Exactly
03last time I checked
03o.o
uh
03wait
no?
03Democrats = liberal
yeah
12Though what's annoying me is that our Prime minister is putting out suggestions, getting opinions then changing his mind based on the country's reaction.. and is actually getting slated for changing his mind? ovO
12WHAT
6It simply would not happen.
03All I really pay attention to legislation-wise is copyright issues
I far as i can tell no i guess I've just come to accept that
6With billions of people in the world one person would eventually turn violent.
12-v-
03as much as Bush didn't do anything, he also didn't give in to copyright crap :P
6And the only way to stop that violent man would be more violence against him.
03let's see, Bill Clinton, Democrat, signed the DMCA
03Bush, republican, nothing
12It's just another way of leaching money from the country
03Obama, democrat, tons more copyright legislation
03HMMMM
12XD
03exactly
03nothing good, notheing bad
03*nothing
03eh
03I hated everybody in the 2008 election LOL
12It works here too, that our democratic equiv is all pro copyright laws
12and yet the conservatives are not really
6yay 2012?
03I hope the Republicans have some really good peopl ein 2012
03because I want someone actually good to vote for
6speaking of which
lol
6OH YEAH, I hate the voting setup in this country
03and this is one benefit to watching FOX News, since it's a republican channel, they have lots of coverage on the republican candidates
/me hides
03Aurora, get this
12right back to work
in my mind it's the lesser of two evils deciding between republicans and democrats, in which case i'd pick dem
03I didn't care about the main elections
6I'm not saying it's rotten.
/me Now Playing: Pendulum - Propane Nightmares -Celldweller Remix-
6see, same would have gone for me
i hate the way politics is going
6It's a result of escalation.
03so I registered to vote
03and went and voted
03XD
6WHICH PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST
6it would have saved our schools majorly
03I'm definitely going and voting agian
6and they said no to it >.>
03*again
03because public libraries are a must, IMHO
6paying less than 10 dollars a month is horrible apparently
03LO
6if it goes to education
03*LOL:
even if i never go there
12Our libraries are closing >v<
03yeah same
6Most animal species do it, really.
03I mean
03screw books
6I never go, but I don't want them to go
03and that's just plain awesome
12LOL
6It's just that when we do it we do it with armies of people we've already established dominance over.
03for $5 for 2 weeks
03:P
i just haven't read any in a while
books <3
12Books are awesome :3
6Everything is more complex than it seems.
6yeah
6but people have a negative IQ around here
6that and they're self centered
03people here are all "I DON'T WANT OT PAY MORE"
03*to
6it's either the people who's children are old and off to college/have no children in the shcools
03LOL MEXICANS
6yeah
6it makes me rage
6so much
>>
04o-o

6I have NOTHING wrong with mexicans alright?
03yeah same here

>it's ILLEGAL mexicans I hate
>mfw
12D:
03is that they have to make packaging bilingual now

12Hmm
03and beause Michigan is incredibly far from Mexizco
03-z
/me walked in on a debate
/me walked in on sarcasm
6if you're going to live in this country
6LEARN THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE
in my mind i kind of see it as it's excusable because i would probably be the same if i moved to a different country
12Which is a good thing in a way, because all the other races are trying to make Britain into something else
03Aurora, techincally we don't have a national language :/
6I don't mind culture, I mind communication
/me rages about some culture and departs
6...
6you're kidding me
03no
03look it up
03America has no official language
6when 995 of the country speaks english-
6...
6 99%
6wth
6alright well
6I still stand by this
English is mostly our main language drf :P
03yeah
03I mean

03I would much rather not the Germans go "GERMAN OR GTFO"
6make an attempt though
04She's travelling
04that's different
6I went to italy for 3 weeks and did everything i could to learn the language

03well, she's 14

06sometimes it's there for a second, sometimes for a bit longer. I'm not entirely sure why :P
12hmm.
o_O
uh
maybe it has to do with the program I'm running that's using 100% CPU...?
04It's not the server

I asked her
10k
Well I'll get pics for you after I've done it.
7Then leave. D:
10Yeah, don't take risks of getting fired
thats why there's a history delete button :D but yeah dun get caught. Safer to leave
lol I don't mean THAT history
They monitor everything here you see..
Tor is still the answer to all problems.
I'm hoping that I can get away with this because the URL for the widget embedded in TST is a little obscure
that and they've never picked up on the fact that I load the shoutbox url
heh ive always went on IRC during school XD
13"Sorry, there is no album where you are allowed to upload files"
12LOL
12Have you created an album then? XD
13Well I tried making my own album anyway
12ovO
13then I was apparently able to upload files to it
13but none of the files actually showed up
;o
12ovO
13I did that, but it won't let me upload anything :/
12One sec
12Stupid SMILEY!!!
12ovO is that "My profile" option still there?
12XD
12LOL where? XD
13right at the end, next to "search"
7On another note, I'm drawing cubism.
12I smell smoke outside
12Ok XD I don't have that LOL!
12Stupid me
12Can you paste the link please?
Send it to EqD :P
13The "create/order my albums" link?
12The profile link
12If it is a link
12Ahh cool XD
12Ok the link to create/order then please? :3

sorry
4Yeah, I know Sprinks
13Ah, damn. Not sure how but I THINK I may have accidentally uploaded a few things to the wrong gallery x-x
13oh
4I'm in the thread having a conversation with Hip
13wait
13maybe that's why |D
4But he hasn't answered me :(
4But I mean really
12:>
12I fixed some of tyhem
4If /oat/ really does move into /chat/ I'll be fucking surprised
4I fully expect all drama/mudslinging/internal politics to stay in /oat/
I was just about to start posting on /oat/...
YIKE
+s
4Do it
that just pop out of no where
4Haha
4Hip says it's pretty much done, and I want a good look at it
/me 7pokes Arti.

7May I have my gallery moderator privileges back? :3
12Yeh I'm working on it lol
12as well as working on work
12Thing is I'm not sure how to fix it yet :/
7Ah, well, work on work first.
4Is that the site?
pretty much
that and the about us page
4I most certainly have a favorite movie
4And favorite pony

Hey guys

/me is going to try to draw a floofy peadge in a nest at a park
RIVERSIDE MOTHAHFUCKAH
7Okay.
7As for approving guest requests?
12Guests cannot upload
7Eep, to clarify, I mean comments. :P
12Ahh
06ohai shadowlugia
12Those go in automatically I think
12There';s a "last comments" link to make things easy though, if you want to check them all
hi
7Okay.
/me bows and huggles shadowlugia
06Gnite all
12Night!
12?
12What peadge...?

/me nuzzles back
4Whew, glad you got it
14where?!
behind you
4I was looking for the mod page over on /chat/, but you can only imagine how difficult that must have been considering /oat/'s begun flooding into that board
/me 14looks behind her but sees nothing...
-z
12Quan?
12I was wrong, guests do appear to require approval ovO
12for comments
6For "fixing" the link I had put in.
12Which is good becuase I just deleted 12 spam ones LOL
6That's like, first rule of web page design.

6i never even see obsi on anymore...
7I'd volunteer. :3
yup
good luck :D
(I also have one, scary)
you know it apok :D
7Approving is biased, if we talk about it such-so.
7Or I could make it democratic.
7Approve all, un-approve those that get at least -5.
6you scare me
6I literally just clicked the image i drew of us two
6rifght when you came back
6http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?pos=-1127
6that one lol
10LOL
4Sabotage? Oh, dear Apok, I would NEVER inadvertently cause you to fail
7Meta.
6GET OUT OF MY MIND
10WHAT
we sit around sipping tea making slightly angry faces but mostly not caring :3
in fact a lot actively hate it
4I'm a little surprised that more than a few Brits disliked the ceremony
I failed. It's a lot more awkward than it looks
12Hehe I have that in my favs XD
No one really thinks about the actual reason for the holiday
To us it's really just
"Firework Day"
the Britain on TV != the Britain I see every day : / it's a horrible, hate-filled mess of chavs and scummy lowlifes
Are you cockney? :>
/me falls on ground randomly
basically, idiots dude. My country is mostly idiots
4Oh
4I see
I'm from poshland, the Home Counties
4I still want to visit Britain some day
dude do it
4I plan on it
4...what kind of cathedrals?
I was in Britain twice
I saw some rocks
some motherfucking awesome cathedrals
and some cliffs. we have lots of cliffs
4I lol'd more than I should have at Apok
there were many people smoking pot there...
Oh yes, I saw cliffs to!
cliffs!
6Well..Cynder7.. :P
wb
To be honest they were impressive cliffs
10Thanks
4When I do go to England, I HAVE to go to Beachy Head
Actually that's where I was...
http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/
I'll think
Old houses
4Apok was at Beachy Head?
Yeah
4Very nice, was it quiet there?
beachy head isn't that in east sussex
http://i.imgur.com/BsMw5.jpg
hold on, talking to myself lol
I guess... I don't remember actually
(talking to myself, accidental post)
4I have this feeling that Beachy Head is abnormally quiet
I have a feeling I'm going to Uni right near there
I was in a hotel that was supposedly haunted... oooooh
you jelly?
4Yes
4I jelly for Beachy Head
I was to France too. They also have cliffs
and crepes
4I also wanna visit Italy
I was there just last week
4Specifically, the country side. Or whatever passes for a country side there
Italians are loud
France is great
The French didn't seem obnoxious to me
I guess it also depends where in France you go
4Maybe not to Apok
they always speed up when you cross the roads in inappropriate places :P
4Because he's not American
7:)
lol
>implying America's the greatest country. (I'm going to get killed for saying this on 4th july)
4Pfft, greatest country
more like not
OBJECTION
4And you think every other country in the world hates us? We hate us too
Britainland is best country
America's not a country *paraspriteface*
12Now back to figuring this gallery prob out..
Really we're fucked
4And then sit back for the laughs
which part? D:
4 /oat/ trollface.jpg
/me 7blinks.
You guys are both jelly of Slovenia because we have.... err... something... I guess
4<RainBroDash>: >implying America's the greatest country. (I'm going to get killed for saying this on 4th july)
heh
4Slovenia?
4What's that?
apparently it's a country
it's one of those little ones that people use in quizzes
They say I live in Slovenia, but I failed to find it on the map
4o.o didn't even know it's a country
4What part of the Earth is located?
4I'm assuming Europe
It's next to Italy
east of it
4But still in Western Europe?
central europe
4Oh
4*nods*
Walmart has more employees as there are people in Slovenia lol
4Man, that's sad

scale of 1 to jelly

^lol
fair
4*Rainbow Dash pout*
:3
We have caves
best caves
4Huh, there's a place called Wolverhampton
4Sounds neat
The longest cave system in the UK is the Easegill System in the Yorkshire Dales, with at least 72 km (45 mi) of passageways.
Wolverhampton is a shithole
all football hooligans and retards
7Anyway, I'm lagging again.
damn you keyboard
4Football..soccer, yes?
Handegg != Football = soccer
4Yeah yeah
4I got it :P
:D
4I don't even like American football, or soccer
4Hell
4I don't even like sports
4Except for two
4Skateboarding and snowboarding
6...
in fairness, me neither. EXCEPT TENNIS ALASDGHALKDG WIMBLEDON WAS GREAT
Proper lawn tennis though
4*shrugs*
bastard :P

4I mean
12WAAAIT
4But whatever
10Hm?
4With models and people and more textures
Heya DRF

6It made me lose my battle.

4See?
4I told you most people were gonna complain :/
:>
4...sorry, Sprinks
4Probably nothing after the cleanup
practically none now haha
oh right no html ha
4More like, it was where all the drama/gossip/mudslinging/internal politics took place
:3
4Ergo, it was the most interesting and entertaining
4!!RainbowDash mod decided to clean up the board
nothing non-pony basically
4And it caused a massive shitstorm between him and users
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/079d4c9c-4e37-4228-983f-1806ac525440.png
4Yep
4So now
4You have /chat/ regulars and /oat/ people in closed quarters
Everypony hates everypony else? :3
"It's safe to dance!"
LOL XD
4So if you wanna know where all the shit's gonna go down, go to /chat/
4PFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
4Love and tolerance is just a motto
03http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/demotivational-posters-fail.jpg
4Some users actually believe in it, and I kinda respect them for it
4Moony, Amonisis...
4But other people?
4Nah
6god yes
6I would rage if one did though
12WHY is KFC always on TV when I am hungry
Is that right?
4Because that's all Ponychan really is
4Sorry about that, went into a mini rant :D
I only posted on ponychan about 5 times

03^ approved
4There, it's been bucked
6Looks like a bomb hit and all that's left are appreciation threads.
4I thought the clean up wasn't to be till tomorrow
12Skylands? D: can you please check the Sprite gallery for me? XD
12Are you logged into it..?
4I guess the regulars up and outright left /oat/
6The cleanup was today.
4 /chat/ is such a...odd place to see right now
6There's an image of a bunch of threads being moved.
4Where?
10Hang on
6And I stopped watching the thread it was in...
10Yep
12You are?! Awesome..
6It was "REMEMBER 4/7/11" XD

12Uh oh

12Cna you just um, logout and back in again pleeease? :3
Heya mib o.o
12Mine is GreatLugia144
12LOL
12XD
I never go to the picture gallery :P
10Odd

10.
12Hmm..?
10Okay, it works
12Phew
12Fixed
/me didn't realise it logged her out of everything
:P
12Yep it actually works LOL
12But login doesn't work yet XD
10Hey Shi-shi
12Omg I just fixed it XD
10SHINY
02Hey
12Now login works!
02FEATHER
10yaaay
12So now you can logout/in with the gallery too!
I wish I had a pogo stick :(
02I'm already logged in, that's how it's gonna stay lmao.
108D
02And then it dawned on me
10:o
02I don't have many picture I'm proud of to upload to the gallery :/
12^
10lol same here
02I must draw my character in Pinkie Pie's room
10DO IT
12Ok thanks Angel XD
02And dedicate it to you for giving me the link to that story :U
12Awarded
02Feather
13:3 Thanks~
13Lol I get all giddy when I see those awards, no idea why |D
06giddy :3
02Pessimism~
13!espeon
13asdfg
06lies
06silly vars
12That pic of you and Xeli is like, seriously the best
12I die everytime I see it
6brb guys, going across the street for food or something, and I'm not leaving my comp here during rush hour.
/me is still surprised
But ohwell
13Really? I don't think it's one of my best, in fact I see loads of errors xD
10I don't <3
/me curls up on Feather's head
02Maybe I'll upload my Deino
Hello
06I'm clearly rather biased, but I think the same! :p
10:D
02I'm sure you haven't seen it
13LOL, thanks a lot~ <3
02I don't even know if you watch me on dA or not anymore XD
4 /oat/ has changed.
magical
4:P
02There we go
4I think I may need to change the GET part though, since I'm still seeing them on /oat/
they shouldn't be though
right?
ha
hopefully inb4 mod conflict!
that would be lulzy
4But then
10XD
4This won't be bad for us
02I never know lol
4Because it seems that there's a lot more traffic over on /chat/
BMN is about ponies?
GET is about GET.
4Originally, the BMN selection threads were on /oat/ but were then moved to /chat/ because they weren't "pony" enough for /oat/
oh really
:/
4Yep
My perception of 'pony enough' must be feebly inaccurate
How is BMN not pony?
4We then had to argue our claim over on /meta/ to the mods of Ponychan to get them to allow us to stay on /oat/
12Wb Creideiki
4Because BMN is mostly about movies
4and just a little about ponies
Hello
i guess :)
although we're all here because we like ponies
02,0,
02.-.
and look at my name
4And I guess the mods understood that and allowed us back on /oat/
(it's like ponies)
4Right
we reference ponies all the time
4But the mods didn't see it that way at first
Most of the preshow is pony videos

10I don't really want them LOL
12Oh XD
12Ok XD
Would you prefer if I carried on trying to be 'americanized' in my language by using words like store, or should i just stick with britishisms like shops
12Who here likes GRIMER?
Whatever you prefer
does it mater?
matter*

/me 4chases
4I think epic sax Spike should be our "Off air" signal
4Instead of just "closing time"
with an off-air watermark
6Then we'll switch to something else.
6...also, that would be epic.
that bulge though. I can't look
6If I could figure out how to do that...
12aww the stretchy yellow man's finger has been cut off

4I'M NOT SHOUTING!!!!!!11
/me 7yawns.
6lol SAT classes
6I can't believe they have classes for that
7Ayup.
I know right
The SAT is easy
just suck it up and take it
6inb4 BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
7Eh, parents do want me to get a high score.
6it was horribly easy
SAT is worse
XD
6which is infamous for being ungodly
I did alright on it actually
my worst section was English
6same
but I got a 29 overall
both times, too
I took it twice, got the same score LOL
6I got a 29 on the ACT, 1650 on SAT
6...lol
I never even took the SAT
/me 7blinks.
because no schools in Michigan care about the SAT
6yeah i'm amazed you're takig it quan
7Eh, not my decision. :P
6the only places that really care about SAT are here in the west lol
nah, lots of east coast schools require the SAT
...the mod thread just 404'd
6oh really?
yeah
7But I get ~750 on my SAT2s.
east coast does too
6we're always told they want ACT xD
I dunno
I just know around here it's ACT
7SAT's primary here.
6no one cares about ACT here
yeah
7ACT's still acceptable, just less common.
s/were/are?
6why do we have 2 tests then D:
7I have no idea.
if they only had one, people would be like OMFG MONOPOLY and not allow it
>_>
6lol
6There's more blood than a rubber hose bottle of foot!
I mean
hi
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You mean our mod thread?
Yeah.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I know right
Vagina
Well
...why is this not a pony vid yet?
4:O
4That's a naughty word
Monopolies are only bad if they're abusive
Give it time
if it's something like standard software used by companies or something
Hey he said it first
it would be a lot more helpful
6...TF?
same with standardized tests
/me 7is reminded of California in the early 2000s.
7But I digress.
13Well, goodnight all <3
but tell the government that
7Good night, AE>
nii
;p
12Bye Angel :3
7I don't see too much of a point in standardized tests; perhaps to compare education, but not as a prerequisite for college. O.o
7Brb.
anyway, I need to go for an hour or two.
6I see the point actually
Well I'm off to celebrate Firework Day, see you guys later!
the point is to prevent idiots like haii from going to college
/me runs
I know I can make you guys officers
Good enough.
Alright
Hold on
Oh u DRF :p
anyway bye
Just need to be able to regulate questions and crap without people going "HURRR DURRR HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S REALLY YOU" or something
That's fine
Then again, I'm not or plan to
whatever
I think I'll hit the sack as well...
6G'night.
I guess I'll keep checking this feed for these unexpected streams. ;)
Well, night.
4Goodnight
Fine by me.
And the only reason I'm doing the twitter is because nopony else seems to want to touch it.
Which reminds me... we need to get the color and flood scripts from dari and ask him how to use them.
Oh yeah, we do need to get a hold of dari
But you know how difficult that is
The main reason I didn't even touch that problem is because I have no idea how to work a website
I believe I would have made it worse >_<
hi :)
:3
:3 any mods about
Disk partitioning is "fun."
6Yep.

12Linux is epic
If you want to do nothing easy, sure ;D
Epicly silly at times too :p
Yes derp :p
you only don't like it because you don't know how to use it ;p
4It appears just recently
But I didn't see it as useful
how is it not useful?
12Ah, well in my opinion, it’s pretty useful
:P
oh hai guise
Only for one off jobs
6Has he... said anything?

Doesn't every normal person? :P
Just line any other day.
/me has been playing TF2 all day.
Except I can't watch movies in peace.

Like, even.
4That reminds me, I should at some point arrange a BMN TF2 session
about two or three poeple drove by with loud booming music
Why? :o
I know
gave me a headache
It's interesting looking through the various distros
4But at some point in the future
Well I'd like to pick one thing that everyone else uses and writes programs for :P
Plus way more tech support

I have no idea.

I never saw him say anything about wanting /oat/ to be random, but, then again, I don't pay nearly enough attention to /meta/
I have... no idea when this happened.
