They all say that you'll get your mark when the time is really right and you know just what your supposed to do and your talent
Spinal Tap are a fake band, so... quite fitting comparison...
Ghosties, Dari lives under a rock
I have the weirdest boner right now
4Except that the band was British
lol
These go to eleven
Scoot is just lip-syncing anyway

Ditto on Sweetie Singing. Gimmie!
So much fail on stage
if you guys have seen previous generations of mlp, which I would have been proud to say I hadn't had Sathi not tortured us one night, then you would know that sweetie belle's cutie mark is a pair of eighth notes. She's been known as a singer in previous generations and knowing about music as well, I'm purposefully making this post big so turbo chat can see
HIT THE GALE FORCE WINDS
THATS SOME FAN
Spinal Tap is hilarious :0

Well of course I prefer Queen anyway.

I'm British.

And here comes Harvey Dent's "I'm super fucking awesome" scene.
HE CHEATED HIS WAY IN TO COLLAGE IN IT

OH YEAH
Salvator is The Master.
BAM
dat punch
lol punch
audible gasp
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent (Two-Face) during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring.
4Man, that's some really Italian stuff there
Fuck your face!
/me hugs Luna FOREVERRRRR

So, what is Rachel's role?
Batman or no Batman
0Robin, what about early Teen Titans show?
You suck Robim
I'm not sure it's /possible/ to do Robin in a serious movie.
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Harvey Dent disarms the witness in court, he removes the magazine from the stock and holds it in his small finger. This is actually the correct procedure for emergency reloads and correcting malfunctions.
Robin is practically an icon of the homosexual agenda
Harvey: my people need me /fly
*Robin
Jim Gordon, one of the only good guys Gary Oldman has ever played
14Hai thar RBD

Batwoman would make for a really interesting movie
/me hugs Robin
Nightwing would too
@RainBroDash...the shit you've missed in SS...whew
Why is Sirius Black a cop?
I thought it was mud
RBD HAS CHAINED SOIPONY TO HIS BASEMENT'S WALL.
2,14 Hey! Hey Robin! Talk to batman about his parents
It's bold....
RAWRity: I thought they retconned out the female Robin.
TOO BOLD

Can anyone list a bad movie morgan freeman's been in?
Uwe Boll is the boss
morgan turns any movie into a documentary
GGgala_ sort of. In one comic (I believe it was nightwing) she became a villain and started talking in these long, verbose diatribes
Best damn director alive

/me kils Robin's self-esteem
4Huh?
Damn you jim carrey :/

You're welcome Robin
NO

BALLS DROP OFF
....yes
0Didja balls drop off?
11There several references to the fall of the Roman republic in the movie. The first is when Bruce meets Harvey at the restaurant and Harvey mentions how the Romans would offer unlimited power to a single citizen to guide them through a crisis. Rachel's character incorrectly states that the last person to get this mantle was Gaius Julius Caesar
11in actuality, Caesar coerced the Roman senate to give him this power.
heeeeyyyyyyy...
Black Dynamite can't take The Joker? puh-leeze...
creepy as hell
a freak like me...
DYNO-MITE.
hi
How did he kniow?
Mane6 stream?
D-do you want to hear how I got this cutie mark?
11Furthermore, in ancient times Caesar represented chaos (as evidenced by Lucan's civil war - where Caesar invokes fortune or chance before he goes crosses the Rubicon and goes to war against Rome) much like the Joker or Harvey later on in this movie.
INCOMING MEME

Sounds simple. Let's do it!
11The analogy then is that Harvey, the gifted statesman and orator, is put against chaos and chance and ultimately fails, only to become the villain
PLAIN AND SIMPLE
WE KILL THE BATMAN
dat plan
does the joker have leverage here?
not the guy on the tv, but the tv itself

14Aww, sorry. XD

11Another reference to the fall of the Roman republic is the fact that Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and Batman form an agreement. In modern times the agreement to control the senate by Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Crassus (the financier of the venture) was known as the first triumvirate.
4Sophisticated. Puns.

2,14 yeah sorry, was never the joker
4@DuskShine: SHHHHHHHHH....no one's supposed to know my secret identity
Wouldn't want you to catch cold.
11Batman, Gordon, and Harvey are similarly trying to control Gotham. As mentioned above Harvey represents Cicero at first (the model citizen) and then Caesar when he becomes a villain. Gordon is Pompey, the aging general who is trying to do good, and thinks this is the only way how. Batman is Crassus, as he brings together and finances the venture.
Dude Bruce is wearing pink that's SO BADASS

I still prefered that episode of the animated series when the batman villains are all discussing how they /almost/ killed the Batman. And Killer Croc says "I almost squashed him with a rock. *beat* What? It was a big rock."
For the third time, and I will continue to say this until someone agrees, Mark Harmon=Good Batman

don't worry applebloom you're a big pony now. Maybe this way you'll get your Batman Symbol Cutie Mark
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It's Sir Michael Caine's opinion that Heath Ledger beat the odds and topped Jack Nicholson's Joker from Batman: "Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath.
11He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture." Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright he forgot his lines.

11for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker).

BUT HE DIDN'T
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film uses numerous elements of the Joker's first appearance in Batman #1, published in 1940. In both The Dark Knight and Batman #1, the Joker publicly announces his crimes before committing them, removes his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he threatened to kill,
11uses a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, steals and kills not for personal gain but simply to create chaos and disorder, and infringes upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters.

Gotta wonder. If they'd just gone with the discolored face, would it have been better?

"No, no you're not..." (octavia)
^
If you havn't seen this movie before ( I have) say "aye"

it's much easier to take harvey seriously if you watch Eckhart's face instead of the crappy CGI one
Harvey Dent is two-face? This comes out of nowhere to me.

Hey. Hey. Everypony. THE GAME.

I'M GONNA BE HERE AT 10PM.I'M DOOMED.
do things
not in a hospital
Reaver021 I have multiple back-upservers and auxillary defense units. Impossible.
11RANDOM KILLS TRIVIA: The Joker only looks at three of the people he kills in the film. He shoots the bus driver while looking back at the hostages. Two of Gambol's thugs he stabs while looking up. He kills Gambol while looking at another thug. He throws the cigar lighting Lau on fire and turns to talk to The Chechen as Lau dies.
It's kind of weird that Joker is obviously making shit up as he goes along half the time
11The two he looks at are the thug he kills with a pencil, the policeman stopping the semi-truck before the chase, and the policeman that is clearing the hospital out which he shoots with a pistol while in a nurse uniform. This character choice is a reference to the graphic novel 'The Man Who Laughs' in which it is mentioned that The Joker "just opened fire and
the plans themselves have plans
11and didn't even look at the people while he killed them".
Meanwhile than go out and search for others.
Schemer from Thomas and Friends was awesome.
pieces of skin on the pillow...

11RANDOM TWO-FACE TRIVIA: Aaron Eckhart enjoyed wearing the Two-Face makeup and warned: "When you look at him, you should get sick to your stomach. It's like you would feel if you met someone whose face had pretty much been ripped off or burned off with acid. There are fans on the Internet who have drawn versions of what they think it looks like,

RAYCHEL
Chin bone
Combustiblelemons indeed.

Combustiblelemons Nice name, by the way.
Aaron Eckhart OD'd on dramatic shouting in the last third of the movie

There's a limit. I'm surprised the idle people haven't been banned.
spaz: I'm sure we've had more than 200 in here at least once
I had some trouble getting in at first, and I know someone accidently set a 200 limit a few weeks ago, so I was just wondering

SEATBELTS EVERYONE

Poor Driver...
i love that scene
Buckle up!
And then Tw-Face Dies, the end.

A BAT CREDIT CAAAAAAAAARD
and... no one realized that the Joker had something in mind when he told them to get on the boats?
A BAT CREDIT CARD
Well this can only be bad.
The actor of Maroni also played in The Young and the Restless after this movie
You've been trolled, you've been trolled, you have probably been told, that this guy's getting a rise out of you
I'LL KILL YOU.

Scary black man alert.

Is that the black guy from The Green Mile?
everyone on the boats has been trolled hard
11RANDOM FERRIES TRIVIA: The ferries used for the ferry scene in which a boat of convicts and citizens are forced to detonate a bomb in the other boat, the ferries depicted are CGI models of the Molinary-class of Staten Island Ferry. The Staten Island Ferry, which is run by the New York Department of Transportation, offers a free 25-minute ride across New York
Batman is concerned about Fairies?
Bombs, bombs everywhere
I HOPE ITS A FOOTBALL

There is a line to hug Luna?
WHERE?
oh my god it's a giant vat of cool aid
A041744,please don't mention shitty soap operas here.
brownies rainbow-derp
yeah, thats what a detonator looks like
For science.
I didn't know Chicago had ferries
now, here's the most interesting question of the movie: Is it the detonator to the other boat, or did the Joker intentionally give them the detonators to their own?
0everfreenlights i know what thats from
the molontry express?
07I'm not sure, why?
0Social experiment=WIN
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNN
All your boats are belong to us.
all ferrytales.
Dat social experiment
Joker wouldn't give them their own detonator. He wants the assholes to live.

a detonator could look like that. all of jokers stuff is kludged together
not the sauce
HERBERT WEST

Idealism vs Cyncism happening now
dat lady is a bitch
That criminal boat doesn't have enough... nah I won't say it.
but I can't recall the name
"All ya'll are fukken idiots."
4It makes more sense for the Joker to hand them the other's detonators. Though, admittedly, if he gave them their own detonators then that means he seeks anarchy regardless
no sir, mr. rainbow-derp. Entirely "herbal" free
nope. Can't think of any other West
i vote convict boat lives
yay democracy!
0lol robot chicken '' ivote none of the ships blow up ''
Clear_Runway, that's awesome.
TRUST IN HUMANITY , REMEMBER THAT?
4So, either he wants anarchy for the public or anarchy for himself
It's the kind of Moral question/gray area that really makes you think. Would you feel you could take the lives of hundreds of others? Is somebody being a criminal mean they're worthy of being destroyed?

11If one group decides to blow up the other, they go free (cooperation, so to speak, with the Joker) and vice versa. Otherwise, they'll run the risk of being blown up themselves. If neither group does anything, they'll both be blown up. The fact that neither group decides to blow up the other would be, according to game theory an irrational decision given
that isnt a prisoners delema...

The "cooperative" answer only works if it's a false dilema in the first place.

dats some money alright
I still personally think the Joker gave them the detonators for their own ship so they'd die because of their own selfishness.
eez late
SWAT agents don't exactly stop to listen to targets when they're on duty
I can say I contributed to the box office success by seeing it on opening day
DONT SAY DROP
PitViper27 but would Joker want to selfish ones to die? I think not

Jabbed in the leg
considering that setting off the detonator would mean you'd have hundreds of deaths laid at your feet, I'm not surprised neither of them could do it
did he shoot a grappling hook through his body? I've never understood what happens here
BATMAN WINS, HEROIC BRUTALITY
Newtons Laws..
anyway.
"You'll be back? Somehow, I don't think so"
This scene is awkward for me.
his legs would have been torn off from that.
Hah, Unstoppable Force and Immovable Object.
Favorite line from the film
fuck physics, he's batman
FUCK LOGIC
rivets - unfortunately, i don't think "through" the body is valid as much as it found a nice cavity...
screw the laws of physics!
Do you think they should get rid of the scene where he saves the Joker in future releases? You know, because of the sequel hook no longer being applicable?

11RANDOM JOKER TRIVIA: In the Italian version Batman, Jack Nicholson's voice was dubbed by actor Giancarlo Giannini. In 'The Dark Knight', Heath Ledger is dubbed by Giannini's son Adriano Giannini, with the result that Italian audience felt a connection between the two Jokers since the voices are very similar.

i think its kinda dumb that he still talks deep to Lucius when its just them i mean he knows who you really are

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This film is seen by some critics as an allegory on the Bush Administration's prosecution of the "War on Terror" (Batman was willing to do "whatever it took" to bring in Joker - including torture and disregarding the law and civil liberties.) It should be noted in doing so, Batman could not see the Joker's true intentions (and real threat
I can't tell when it is because it's saturday now.

11Don't blame me, blame the critics.

stare master
0Anyone seen Re-Animator yet?
whoops
stare master? Ugh, worst episode
WINDOWS!
I'm glad there won't be a Robin in the series. I like the character, but for the tone Nolan's set, it just wouldn't work.
yee
black lantern twoface?
nope
yay stare mare
I haven't seen Re-Animator.
Nobody cares about the credits music
robin rocks
any predictions on the # of chicken jokes?
So this is a new experience for me.

*Robin
I've not seen the re-animator. looking foward to it
STARE MASTER?!? Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yeeeees!!!

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The only Batman movie where Batman does not use a batarang.
I hope it's a magical adventure full of wonder and SCIENCE!
oh man having to sit through citizen kane and King Kong in one day
griffon the brush-off is worst episode
I see the allegory perfectly. It's just not preachy or intrusive
yes
yes it is
Lies and Slander!
Batman, that is amazing
0alright back
but that would mean making another green lanter movie
I haven't seen reanimator either.
... not enough room?
well... that assumes that the 6-shooter on Batman's wrist doesn't count @Trivia
SWEETIE BELL SINGING SOON\
Those things on his forearm were totally batarangs.
SLANDERMAN
what does he live in a cupboard
0I want the mask though
becuase Batarangs are for hackers
enough room? does he live in a trailer?
Bale couldn't fit it all in
They were just mechanically launched.
and god knows we cant have another one
It just seems like a huge stretch to me
oh shi-
Re-Animator is awesome.
What's Re-Animator about? Never even heard of it before XD
11 3 minutes to next show, people.
re-animator, oh god
OMG! LUNA IS GONNA BLOW UP THE CHAT IN 3 MINUTES!

Silverscreen: if those things on the wrist-guard earlier in the movie weren't batterangs, what were they?
0I want to see it
3 minutes, enough time to make some popcorn!!
THE CHAT'S GONNA BLOW!?!? >IT'S A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT
4And I have no idea what it's about
Somebody get the detonator!
Never heard of it.
You go save Luna! We'll go after Spike!
or do they not count since they weren't used against actual people?
0you know the 3:00 on the screen
i got some CUPCAKES! =D
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO
the reliving dead
/me holds detonator while eerie string music plays
Where is the detonator!
IT'S A BOMB
0lucky
/me shrugs
No time!
/me tackles DSNesmith
i have officially told someone other than the internet that iam a brony
/me twists key
0oh god he has cupcakes!
Re-animator is based on H.P lovecraft book
did it today
Next time I get picked for B movie though (if that happens), I have the best movie planned...
0why a tiemr
Twilight can't disarm it!
A BOBM.
07how did it feel Crazyjay?
I'm pretty sure The Fall (2006) is an A movie
are we picking the next films tonight?
The title alone is completely epic
SOMEPONY'S NUMBER CAME UP
I'm back
OH GOD JC! A BOMB!
*BOMB
0Crazyjay, i did it 2 days ago
nice crazyjay
would have sucked if a fish hit the button as it was sinking to the sea floor
it was good.... it was really good
0what is this
The Fall is a pretty cool movie
/me suddenly opens the doors, gets on the floor and then everybody walked the dinosaur
nevar telling anyone
wait wait wait, is it based of herbert west: reanimator? I thought it was just a cool name
stupid question; how scary is the next movie?
I haven't figured out how to do the Brony Reveal without coming off like a pedophile
0Is walking the dinosour
Who can possibly save us from this bomb!?
Can somepony please give applebloomcutie24 the ropes? she's new here.
Nyst - if it's a B-movie, that should be descriptive enough
hah
difficulty: a lot of people think I'm a pedophile already
this is from inception
I snuck my "reveal" to a whole forum.
12The ropes?
Funny scary? Blood and gore scary? Psychologically scary?
at 0:21 seconds I will be GOD TIER.
0Iheart inception
gory
Thanks
what is the next movie?
0inception is my fasvorite movie
Nyst:more gore
There are just some days you can't get ride of a bomb
so when is the lotto?
Fritz The Cat is A and B movie.
Gory I can handle :)
what do you mean rivets
But I'm not alone there.
everfreenights: saturday
i just told my best friend the truth. i fucking love the show, i read fanfics i go on ED like every day.... he understood
B because of furries.
hey, has inception been shown as an A movie here yet?
It's those movies that get inside your head I can't take
I mean introduce your selfs to applebloomcutie24
And it's old
It has.
Re-Animator is a good movie.
Hrmm...next Movie should be...SAVING PRIVATE RYAN?
we all have guilty pleasures
pedo how?
rivets its worse for me I work with children, If i tell people I like MLP what are they gonna think?
would borat be an a movie or a b movie?
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The serrated edges on the side of the Batman's gauntlets were inspired by the pulp character Tony Quinn, the Black Bat, whose origin (he was a district attorney victim of an acid flinging gangster) was borrowed for Two-Face.
its gory thats about it
We saw Inception already
0My friend wasnt so willing to accept...
1 minute till detonation
We've already shown Saving Private Ryan.
0can't read fast enofe...
hi applebloomcutie24
OH SHIT
Saving Private Ryan and Inception have already played
www.ponyvspony.com
"STRANGER"
would borat be an a movie or a b movie?
so I'll probably be signing off for a while during re-animator, 'cause I wanna work on my NaPoWriMo entry.
word, when my older brother found out, he called me a closet faggot and said all bronies were pedo's ... lol
ah. thanks. must have missed it
Commando would be fun
Awesomeadam76> why not?
spazturtle at least you have the excuse of "we show it for the kids and I got hooked"
play thet till its done
we need some killer klowns from outerspace
/me 4wishes he could have been there for Saving Private Ryan
Can we have Back to the future?
0Hey, silverscreen, i thought it was the last trivia!!!
oh yeah...well I never win that anyway, IF I DID win the lotto, I would pick castle in the sky from studio ghibli
done kung pow yet?
Times almost up...
Damn you US time zone. I have 4 AM here >:(
interior_gummy: unfortunately, i would think it's A-movie
YES, killer clowns!

Blad Runner!!!!!!!
I was introduced to the show by the /b/ threads, I wanted to see what all the hate was about
Blade Runner!!!!!!!
Can't wait to pick up the Bat family titles of the New 52
words
Who will save us?
0Are you guys really getting all this hate? All my public Brony reveals have went over very well
WE should do rocky horror picture show XD
0Crazyjay: IDK? He thinks its weird
Ghosties, are you saying that Saving Private Ryan has already happened here!?
well then
I wonder if Fritz the Cat is a good movie.
High Lander
Awesome killer shadow puppet T-rex.
Vanilla Ice's 1991 movie "Cool as Ice"

Lovecraft was very racist, but he was educated, at least.
@Silverscreen VERY loosely, considering it takes place in a totally different time period
keep watchen the blinkenlights

DEFIBS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
isn't there a new lovecraft movie coming out from the people that made that silent film a couple of years ago?

I still don't get why West just didn't go to another school and SHOW his work.

important note: reanimation can only take place on a table and NOT on the floor

14OH SNAP DECAP
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: David Gale (the Dean) was made to shave his head and wear a toupee, as this was found to be in keeping with Dr. Hill's character. In the DVD commentary, it was revealed that this was also necessary for budgetary reasons, as there was no money available to match Gale's hair on a prosthetic head prop.
I can totaly see they guy breathing....
That would make him Chaotic Neutral, then.
DO EEEEEEEET
science is magic
Herbert's like a little mad scientist puppy
HES ALIVE
@Sage its the term Lovecraft used in the original story
14OH SHI- NOT AGAIN
