Yeah :P
TRANCES
/me wubs
0,5Another thing
some people are so annoying "you like some other taste of (insert anything here) so you suck)
/me is entranced by the song
0,5Why do bronies say "Love and Tolverance"?
/me lolol
0,5Im a brony and I find that annoying
Who knows.
nick: please refrain from posting video links during a stream, it's considered rather rude
I'm annoying and I find that a brony.
Isn't there a chatroom for talking about technical difficulties?
0,5If someone pisses me off Im not gonna "love" or "tolerate" them
LC because that is what the show is about?
It was supposed to just be a reaction.
Love and tolerance is just a passive aggressive response, sadly.
^
0,5Meh
0,5I find it annoying
05does it look portalish?
Love them with your fist
0,5If it gets overused
If you must post these links during stream, please PM them.
Yeah
eeyup
It totally does wrek
I'm back
My pony has 'stache
LordCelestia the love and tolerance thing means "i'm going to f(yay~)k you up
Ah!! Now i see what youre drawing!
WHEATLEY PONY IS BEST PONY
Dashie is best pony
Or it just means a really crushing hug
Pshh
FATALITY: Loved and tolerated.
^
YourLittleDashie: your name makes me cry
btw will there be a pony stream tomorrow?
http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltj81imaDj1r4lccgo1_500.jpg
I know there is no new ep
Ragnalock: D'aww *hugs you*
Wheatley pony is also amputee pony apparently
Jim lol
:P
To me, "love and tolerate" is a neutral stance to avoiding conflict with pony haters or similar disagreements with Bronyism in general.
derp
why is my chat lagging so hard
Real bosses can have this video open in 15 tabs at once: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRGbrs83wRA
/me shrugpony
What tool are you using for SAI to do those nice sketch lines?
Am I the only one who pronounces it garla
not galla
I'm trying that dashie
for me it's gaala
gA-luh
gARler
dat chassis?
I always thought "Love and Tolerate" meant that you accepet the hater's views and arguments and basically ignore them
Because I are britesh!
brb
OH GOD DASHIE, WHY WOULD YOU DO
Whatever you guys do, do not check out the scandinavian versions of My Little Pony. I did, and i cried.
cried in shame? cried with joy?
?
personality pony?
Cried in shame, my eyes and ears bled
Wheatley pony!
I'm tempted to view
chat is fixed nao
You have been warned. :)
Why would your eyes bleed? Aren't they the same ponies?
/me comes in hearing the best song in the world.
i once took a look qat the german version. it made me feel shame
FLUTTERSHY IS ALWAYS ANGRY IN GERMAN
Well, i cried blood then! Either way, it was horrible.
wrek drawing I assume?
TBH, they aren't that bad. Although the original voice actors are better
don't know about fluttershy, i couldn't bear more than 2 minutes into one episode
I thought you were going to draw fluttershy with glasses and a hat?
I wonder if there is an arabic one?
then my self preservation instincts made me close the window
They have a video of all the ponies in different languages on youtube.
Is... is that a Wheatly pony?
equestria girls remix?
yes
PICKLE BARREL KUMQUAT
It's the Pony Core!
Wheatley is best pony

Can't quite place it
My OCD wants to say something, i'm not responsible for the next thing i say
Did someone say tardis>
eeyup

Must be a problem with the web host
Not much we can do about it I think
<Tara Strong> Dear Princess Celestia, This week I learned about trolling, rules, & that cartoons can b enjoyed by all ages..sometimes a little too much!
oh tara, so lulzy
I figured it out. My Flash plugin was disabled for some reason. Idk.
at school today there was a massivee s[yay]tstorm
Too much??? :O
Internet is crushing her. :(
June Bronycon is in Jersey, yes?
Portal Pony?

NOOO I MISSED AN AWESOME SONG
GO BACK WREK
Almost everyone in my class started raging at me because i watch ponies
i was like whatisthisidonteven
their just jealous Ragna
so for anyone else having this problem, you can suggest they go to "chrome://plugins/" and make sure all plugins are enabled.
Thanks anyway.
jealous that their favourite show isn't as awesome as FiM
How did they find out? :D
did you tell them?
they started talking about ponies
because if you did,and they made fun of you,then their asswipes
"how can grown up men watch ponies etc etc"
REAL friends accept what their friends watch
high school or college?
then i told them i watch ponies
vocational school
whats that?
O.o
it's where i study for a profession
What are you studying?
basically extra curricular things
for example i'm studying to become a electrician
ah
Ohh my, John DeLance is epic even when he's just talking about himself
So, it's like, isntead of just "Math" it's math that teaches you what you need as an electrician?

^
At the galaaaaaaaaaaa
noon for me
yes, but realize folks that before, the west coast of USA (i.e. Sethisto, if i recall) saw the episode at 6AM before
and 5AM before that
^_^ fluttershy's singing <3
7,not 6
what movue is gonna stream tonight?
>Implying Seth sleeps.
Rarity time! :$
Do they show the pony episodes on here?
now the USA west coast gets it at 10AM, like we used to
Coolbluemidnite: yes
Normaly i watch them on youtube
yo everypony
Confound these confusing timezones
Coolbluemidnite - only on BMN and for the new episode streams
ohai Ingwaz
not during the week
Awesome ^_^ i'm watching it here
The USA East coast gets it at 10AM
Why can't everything have the same timezone.
So Australians now have to watch new episodes at...
you know who inspired me to become a brony? DERPY!
Because that would be silly. :D
Because the world had to be difficult and decide to be round
ThatsAShinySkyz - that's the West coast
Hub needs to provide time delay feeds for the west coast like all other real networks.
o_o
East Coast is 1PM
We need discworls. Props to anyone who knows what it is.
Really?
At least I can eat dinner while watching the new ep
what timeis it on the moon?
It's more like, why did the US decide to use am/pm instead of 24hr format like sophisticated people. :)
XD
suddenly, stream ded?
GTG Bye guys!
Wrex is having dinner
Suddenly, eggs.
nope, nevermind
delaying would be pointless. Who would wait 3 hours for their ponies to re-air?

Should I trade in my 3DS, Dark Souls and Lord of the Rings: War in the North for Mass Effect 3? I don't ever seem to play my 3DS and I've beaten the two games already almost to completion.
Celestia was in a hair band
well that's weird
Yes otakon.
what was it called?
get Mass Effect 3 and cash.
ca$h
I have it as a rule to never trade in games, even if i've beaten them. Since i might want to play them again sometime
That's quite a lot for just one game
ME3 looks good
I vote yes cus everyone else is :D
whut.
Wrek: you too? I'm supporting Bioware!
LOTR mand 3DS aren't great losses, but I think youll eventually miss Dark Souls.
I think I will be back for BMN, laters everyone
yeah they are crooks
Pale_Horse: I have Demon's Soul's for PS3
PC gaming is the only gaming
Also known as EA
05Electronic Valve
05from yesterdays conversation xD
yep
Electronic Valve? :O
I would trade in Demon's Soul's but it's near worthless as trade in value now
Meh i feel dizzy ):
:(
So whens TF2 again?
later on
05Announced today: EA and Valve are joinign together merging their companies under a new brand called Skynet.
i have fallout 3 for my Xbox 360 and PC
EW.
Wrek: lol
Pfft, clearly lies.
not you CCCP
but EA
:(
Everyone knows google is Skynet.
:P
/me is too lazy to ask for otakon's 3DS friend code.
i know
Valve would never join with EA, Valve is too fond of their fans. :P
No worries. Square-Enix will just absorb them after.
Wrek: skynet better make TF3 and portal 3 and L4D3
yeah
05nah
http://cricketsoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/skynet-google-tshirt.jpg
valve cant count to 3!
CCCP: I have Dragon Age Origins Ultimate Edition for PC AND Xbox360. The PC version was on sale for 5 bucks I COULD NOT PASS IT UP!
05they will jsut focus on releasing call of modern warfield 5: battle ops.
Yeah, XD
lmfao
otakon: was it on steam? (i dont have steam)
Some band
CCCP: nope, gamefly
some CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS out there tonight
oh
You should get Steam. it's like a gaming bargain bin right on your PC.
Otakon, you did it wrong
its
CCCP: Nope, Chuck Testa.
-noms chips and tuna-
CCCP: the sale is long over though and I do have Steam Pale_Horse
Coolbluemidnite: that "some band" happens to be Areosmith one of the best bands in history
Pale_Horse: It will still drain your wallet dry because of so many games
Sorry i havent heard there music before and forgot the name xD
05String_Shredder you misspelled Pink Floyd
is it bad that i have hair like the singer? :>
Yeah, I already bought one game from Steam I'm okay

Wrek: iseewatyoudidthar

Coolbluemidnite: Great, been a while since i've used one! :D
/me shrugpony
05also guys, who is this feat.? he's in every song!!!!
to be honest i dont hate Justin Beiber. I mean i dont really like any of his music but the fact that so many people hate him is just wrong. Many people would actually kill him and i feal really bad for him. I mean they dont judge him of his personality they judge him off his mediocre bland musicand thats not fair.
thats a shiny sky: /)
(\
Aha (:
;P
TBH, Rebecca Blacks newer songs are kinda fine
not Friday
thats just *puke*
Friday was crap but some of them are OK
Wrek: feat. is my favorite singer
Friday is awesome though, i always play that on fridays

eeyup
yup
RAWRity: I am looking forward to that movie
RAWRity: Im offended by the huge ammount of scotsman in that
Oh no she did NOT just shoot that arrow.
need smore
Grave.
Brave.
Oh no.
You did not.
Golakka: well, it IS set in scotland.
Coolbluemidnite: Watching ponies obviously points to our underlaying latent desire to fondle little boys. That or something about sexual attraction for our mothers... I wasn't entirely awake in psychoanalysis...
xles: Well, obviously.
Is anyone going to get out of this screen?
o.o lolwut?
=D
/me hugs everypony.
/me hugs xles
That Brave movie looks like it might be pretty epic
LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR!

Anything pixar or disney is epic.
hmm, Brave looks awesme
Anyone remember the bugs life movie? :3
sort of
I do.
i love it ^_^
yup
There we go, am i live? :O
LIVIN IT WHILE I'M GOING DOWN
Yeah, though I didn't like it as much as other Pixar movies
vaugely
Yeah, I liked it.
up*
up is a good movie
yes it is
I prefer Tangled.
My favorite Pixar movie is Wall-E
RAWRity: that new trailer looks GOOD
I really love the animation in Tangled.
the beginning is so depressing in up
Wall-e FTW.
Wall-e makes my friend cry
CrimsonFoxx: same here, but I really like UP too
i like monsters inc
MONSTERS INC <£
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/224/974/90330f59_justin-timberlake-jizz-in-my-pants-12.jpg - Brave
Yeah, Up is awesome
<3 I mean
Brave is aljsdas
Toy Story 3, who like that?
Dat <£
otakon: if nothing else, it's pretty much guaranteed to be better than the LAST Pixar movie.
otakon: It was alright.
I like toy story 1 and 2 havent seen 3
RAWRity: you mean Cars 2?
otakon: we don't refer to it by name.
It's epic.
Kammerjunk: it was alright? really? it was probably the most emotionally charged one of the series
The-film-that-shall-not-be-named
Toy Story 3 is awesome
/me sudders at thought of cars 2
Probably. I don't know.
yes it is
I fell asleep.
DeathStar: we do not speak its name!
sorry :(
But that's because I hadn't gotten any sleep, not because it was boring.
also, Tangled was really enjoyable
otakon: no, it's pretty crap.
not FANTASTIC or nothing but fun
i dont like cars i almost fell asleap to it o.ol
I really like what animation has become, as shown in Tangled. I haven't gotten around to seeing that new animation film.
Anyone seen puss in boots?
I haven't seen Cars 2 so I can't really from a opinion tbh
i wanna see that so bad
I need to pirate Cars 2.
I don't remember the name of it. Something to do with a ship.
MUPPETS <3
Tintin, maybe?
so i got bored today, played some wow
I don't know.
Gais, is it possible to get those pony smilies in the irc client? :O
Woke up lvl 70, logged off 85 :p
MUPPTS!
I keep that forgetting Puss In Boots came out
I wanna see muppets movie <3
Kammerjunk: The animation is like a classic Disney animated movie in 3 dimensions, it really is
Puss in Boots was pretty good, though not really as good as the Shrek movies
miss piggie is best muppet
It was really good.
^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZuqcYVF_Wo&feature=channel_video_title
Golakka: With our without heirlooms?
I loved the Muppets
I REALLY want to see The Muppets too
or without*
Without
/me didn't like tangled very much.
Neat.
i see herilooms as cheating
Never bothered with them myself.
can somepony please change the song with their unicorn magic?
Rofl Jim, good one. :D
I liked Tangled I guess. I wasn't really wowed by it.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to raid in vanilla.
/me mutes the stream bc the looped music is KILLING me
Well, no, I wasn't moved by Tangled. I just like the animation in it.
same

otakon: Yes, and "organised" "attack".
an*
And what a successful attack it was -sarcasm-
Shizuka: I did read about one trolling group that had planned it
Pity he was banned. I like a project.
I'll be back at 7:00 EST. Stick around.
LOOL
Brb sorting eyes out there annoying me v_v
INSANELY PISSED OFF.
IM BACK, ITS GILDA NOOBS
FK U ALL
pikorar: we shall be here
e.o
13inb4 kline
You're back! :D
CHAN SHALL INVADE
yay
LAUNCHED ATTACK MUCH?
Organized attacked. I don't know what to say about that.
4CHAN SHALL INVADE
I knew my pet would come back to me.
Yay, more fun with the troll!
hello again pony_946416
STUPUID BRONY FAGS
OH MY GOD. I WENT ON MW3 PC, FIRST GAME, A HACKER, SECOND GAME, HACKER
134chan is not your personal army
00,10yay such a good pet
/me hugs pony_946416
/me rolls over...this again?
4CHAN SHALL INVADE
00,10he knows his way home.
Brb sorting eyes
Aww
oh why?
d'aww
Why he type so fast.
pony_946416: will you have my babbies
bc he can
13because he's six and has nothing better to do
Why would 4chan attack anyway?
yeah
there we go
klaxa, you don't have to ban him.
indeed, I don't even go to 4chan
What did we ever do to 4chan?
klaxa: hello sir, fine job you are doing keeping the peace
well i was asked to take care of it by Derpy_Hooves, so... i mean seriously
Attacking us will make his dad proud.
If we want to ban him, we'll ban him
Pony_946416, don't you know that 4chan is where this fandom started? They can't help you there
It will also give him a bigger e-peen.
13fwiw he does keep coming back with different IPs
13so unless we want to nuke his ISP..
Shizuka: any idea how?
Holy crap. This thing hates Google Chrome.
Hi, what's going on?
We're taming our pet troll.
13a) proxy, b) dialup, or c) ridiculously low DHCP turnaround time
Ah.
1,3school's out for the day, so the trolls come to play
Ooooooh! A troll? Why was I not informed of this?!
He'll probably be back in a minute.
This should be fun.
00,10iinet is't that a cell company?
That's why we're taming him
13and i doubt C cause the client doesn't decide "i don't want this address anymore", the server says "you don't get this address anymore"
Howdy Jim by the way.
ohai there Everlasting_Joy
AND HE SAID, "Rage the best rage in the world, or I'll troll your site."
13so either a or b
rage is best rage? as opposed to what?
b
im saying b
it takes a little bit to change proxy
dialup?
1,3people still use dialup?
Me and Kyle, we looked at eachother. And we each said! OK
yeah
TheNuclearPeaceKeepe: No idea, I'm just spouting whatever's on my mind.
13i'll get a version next time he oozes in here
Kirzstryfe, i know someone who does
Speak today, think tomorrow. That's me.
so i hope this is being dealt with, if he comes back just ban his hostmask
hes our pet ;(
We need to learn so interrogation/diplomacy skills here.
And we raged the first thing that came to our minds, just so happen to be, the best rage in the world, it was the best rage in the woooorld.
13we've tried that though, if he comes back with different ips then our only option is to wildcard down to the ISP level
exactly, we troll them, we learn lessons, we send letters to celestia.
/me stops singing
Why isn't he back yet? :<
:<
Jim: Needless to say, the troll was stunned.
Jim: aww y u stop
Back has the parasprite died yet?
FUHCHE-AN WILLEHZ INVADOS!
**I move away from the mic to breathe*
00,10just put some kibble out Dari he will come back when he gets hungry.
onmonmonm
:D
I'm pretty sure professional interrogators don't go arround calling their prisoners "Terrorists". We need to be mature about this.
-puts bacon out-
they'll come back soon
we need to be smart
we are being mature, brb
not take the bait he gives
Even though he's a master at bating....
Ugh

So prince, a little update on my Chrome problem earlier: The Flash file I enabled did fix the problem, but then the chat stopped working properly when enabled (it's apparently an experimental file). In any case, the original problem is trivial, as it hasn't affected anything major for me. I should probably just wait for the next update.

TF2 has all kinds of brony stuff
Over seven miles, it'd have dropped off significantly and slowed a great deal, allowing air resistance to drag it down faster. But the air isn't "bulletproof", it's just slowing the bullet down.
No, no it isn't

Here's the thing, I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't die from a bullet after it went through that amount of ballistic glass. It would hurt, but more then likey wouldn't kill you

Quote from My Little Dashie:
I think she understands me, for after I say those words her eyes return to their normal size, and she snuggles herself more comfortably inside my jacket. She squirms a little, trying to get into a more comfortable position. I can feel her hooves and wings poking me as she shifts. Then, to top it off, she rests her chin onto my arm and lets out a deep sigh, closing her eyes to drift off to sleep.

08,01oh dear lord, flutterflies
punny?
10000000 fluttershys would make my life complete
I AM IN SCOOL TO!
Fluttershy would ahve a very tough time in Skyrim... so many butterflies, but the second you touch them, the game automatically rips their wings off and puts them in your inventory...
yay :[
/me bursts into flames
/me dies from the diabeetus and explodes from awesomeness
bunny I think
The diabetus is beyond comprehendable levels.
PONIES
If 1 Fluttershy can cause diabeetus, imagine what 10 million of them will do to you
Diabetes runs in my family...
OhioBronyShow: Because the professor seeks to sabotage BMN for me and decides to have class during BMN.
quick somepony get me my insulin
so far I've avoided it
in my opinion fluttershy is best pony..we have our own opinions
...i wish i could get high enough to see fluttershy's...
my thoughts on this song. http://i.imgur.com/BpJld.png
WHAT ARE THE CUTE LEVELS OF THIS SONG?!
same
but I think I can feel it starting up...
1000000 Fluttershys = 1000000 heart explosions
Oh.
10 million Fluttershy's would cause you literally turn to sugar.
i try to picture this song... so... glorious
You're listening to that song.
im the kind of person who would rename the original, then put this under the original name, then give it to owl city fans
ITS OVER 900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

i need to come here more ofen, my music collection becomes more awesome
OTP.
/me haz not seen Serenity or Firefly
sleeping is the gateway to equestria
shes so cute i daaaw everytime i see her
Quantum science is the gateway to Equestria.
And then Spike met his new father
Lol, Dashie_Dashie :D
Ok srsly how long is this? lol
That's why I keep telling you ponies to become quantum scientists.
I actually had a dream about ponies last night. I distinctly remember Lyra and Bon Bon
And was terrified
Lucid Do tell more.
Is it necessary to watch Firefly to understand whats going on in Serenity
this song is just awesome
Search your feelings Spike, you know it to be true.
Somewhere in the mutiverse... in parallel dimentions... we are already all ponies...
love pony dreams
If people actually went to Equestria, wouldn't they bring thousands of deadly bacteria that could potentially kill thousands of ponies?
IshBestPony not necessary
firefly @_@ need to watch
Oh god...the diabeetus, its too much.....
what would you do if you saw fluttershy in real life
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!
OHBOI.
O.o
but there are alot of references within the show
YUS
hahaha
xDD
If I remember correctly, Lyra somehow had gained the power of invisibilty, and was trolling Bon-Bon
nyom nyom nyom
Dis vid.
:D :D
fluttershyfan158: hug her ofc
IshBestPony, it's advised honestly, but not necessary.
Yay
this looks fun
nyan
YES
I'd watch the series first.
evening Ponies
:$
sadly there's no ponies in this
I wonder, when Spike hits puberty, do you think he'll get caught rifling through Rarity's saddle drawer?
It was my first pony dream. And I was so happy
dem nyan cats
Aw...
but I don't haz time to watch the series :(
but it's one of those series where you can watch the movie first, then the series and still get it.
pony dream? do go on
leek!
I've seen it so many times .__.
ponie's don't rreally count as a meme, you know?
SPIKE WANT.
*yoink*
if he hasn't done it already
BUT!
*brain melt(
me too..i would also take her home like my little dashie and raise her
celeryyyy
worst pony dream I ever had was me trying to revive Trixie, but she died
we create memes of our own
I know all the memes in this, so im proud of that i guess
Once Spike hits puberty he'd be larger than Rarity herself
o.o
That's not how you cook, Orihime...
Leek.
Oh please don't bring up MLD, I'll cry again.
Where was Gondor when the memes were everywhere?
bwahahahaha
need to go book mark this aswell
No, he'd probably just ask her, because he's socially awkward
I know most of the memes
Hey everypony :)
Allo tgl1992
playing guitar with a leek is hard...
hello there
08,01i'd hug fluttershy. i'd glomp applejack. i'd brohoof rainbow dash. i'd fall on the floor laughing with pinkie pie. i'd nuzzle rarity.
over 40 memes in one song? MLP better be in there
lots of my friends don't know what leek spin is though
08,01but i'd totally tap twilight sparkle.
sadly, it's not
What better way to make damn sure your song will age horribly than to make it nothing but memes.
I know all of these, so I'm glad to say...I spend way too much time on the Internet.
Spike thne?
Lucid i had one were i was in a club with vinyl playing...and you canprobaly guess what happens next because of all the shipfic's
pony shirt!!!!
This was before MLP
BABABAAAAAA
08,01i need ot make this into a song
:|
this song needs to b e remade
It'll be stable soon.
FOREVER ALOOOONE...

Forever alone fist pump.

Good evening everyone
Spike will (in my headcanon) kidnap all of ponyville as his horde and will never let them leave his site

Do the fighting is magic themes after this
Inb4 Seth Mcfarlane puts actual pony referances in Family Guy. And they suck.
3.2.8.1 works just as well, and 3.2.9 has issues on shadow
"Lindsay, why are you late for schoo-" "POP TARTS!"
Nah bro, Nightmare Mode is best mode
hello everyone.
I perfer the non dubstep
of anything
SUDDENLY: Uurge to drift through a mountain pass in japan appeared!
fighting is magic, applejacks theme
Allo Dermathil.
lool i got this song
THAT IS AWESOME
luna by far best pony :)
hi~ Dermathil
for some odd reason, whenever someone connects to the 3.2.9 ircd, it blows up
Dream mode is best version
I'm so looking forward to ADAM. BALDWIN.
Discord is best pony.
"This weirder than the time I went to Ponyville"
Woona is best Princess

/me 08,01nuzzles IshBestPony
I know, but ive heard dubstep, and im not really fond of it :\
and everybody agrees to never speak of it again.
Brony4Life: dubstep ain't so bad actually.... if it's done right.... which sadly is as rare as diamonds
It was funny once. ONCE!
Meanwhile: year.
08,01Dashie_Dashie: you know she's telekinetic right?
And now it's just too damn long
and you hear this from a metalhead
it sounds like a baby being beaten to death by a farting moose who happens to be in a meat grinder for some reasons.
cannot unhear.
Year? What?
I'm magical myself.
i hate dubstep no matter what
08,01Dashie_Dashie: she could pull a Dark Phoenix on you
that is all dubstep.
*yeah
Then you'd be all all... "...Wait. How did I get on the moon?..."
Ah
huh, I should check out dub step .....yes I live under a rock
Can someone help me, everytime I try to get into a theatre, the pictures with the mane 6 don't show up, instead it says "missing plugin." I've tried rebooting shockwave flash but it doesn't work.
Awesome.
Adam Baldwin is hotsauce.
I dislike dubstep. I don't even understand it
Ok maybe twice with the Drunka Lunka thing

Rainbow Factory!

Glaze is a kewl guy

yeah.
sadly, the fic kinda doesn't live up to the music
no vid?
Rainbow Factor
what is this?
Rainbow factory <3
People still keep saying it should come back. No, no it should not. What we got was good. Now let's leave it the fuck alone and stop trying to revive zombies.
nice
Also, River is best Summer Glau
08,01Tovler: only the fic
i read part of the fic, it got boring
OH GOD
rainbow factory wasn't as bad as some other fics
...
Ah yes the Rainbow factory
NOT THE RAINBOWFACTORY
08,01the song's fine, i think
got booring before the bad bits
it's the soundtrack to a fic calles rainbow factory
08,01it's great song
anything but that
Rainbow Factory song is Awesome!!
DAT BASS
I'm so happy my pick was played!!!
read that fic... don't see what the big deal is
Rainbow factory?
Also, Adam Baldwin was in Chuck, Mass Effect 2-3 and I think Full Metal Jacket?
No, I think it should come back, just with the exact same cast a crew
/me nomz everypony
Rainbow Factory. I think I read something called that.
and*
i didnt read this
R.I.P. Orion
/me is nommed
Song is good fic not so much
luulullluul
OK? i can hear the music, but i dont see eny thing on the screeen other than the end of the last vid.
i read Rainbow Factory after Cupcakes to balance it out
The fic was awesome!! I wanted a second one!! Hated the ending to Rainbow Factory....
yeah the fic was kinda lame
I can't remember what it was aboutl.
In the Rainbow Factory...Where fears and horrors come true....
I like the nightcore version better
I can pretty much guarantee that the Arrested Development movie is going to be SHIT.
but i'm liking this music
Every Pegasi knows the story of the Rainbow factory DKen
Where not a single soul gets through.
I need help from every brony in here, where should one go to purchase brony shirts within the eu?!
I like this one best. Usually you like the version you hear first.
god I love the effects he uses on his voice
its a fanfic about bad things
So what is the Firefly series about?
You STOLE Fizzy lifting drinks!
Snuffsis: RedBubble
the ending to rainbow factory felt lazy to me >>
Yeah this stream is good, but I'ma go listen to some other muzik
So are most fanfics.

And Halo fans pay attention here. Adam Tudyk and Adam Baldwin and Nathan Fillion have voiced characters in ODST and Halo 3
^^
Adam Baldwin could kick Chuck Norris's ass any day
Nice.
*Alan Tudyk
.-.
I KNEW IT!
Does anyone know how long this movie is
this is anger
this isn't fear, this is bad acting.
wow so cool
Could care less about Halo
Adam Tudyk was also in 300.
He makes me think of doctor spock.
fact well known
... no emotion
Personally, I'd rather take Nathan Fillion over anyone else
fear leads to anger anger leads to hate
That isn't saying much, Spongebob Squarepants could kick Chuck Norris's ass.
wait is that Buck from ODST?
Then why Hasn't The Doctor saved any of OUR people? HMMM
halo is awesome
IngloriousPony89: yh, the plastic is very stiff and it's small, like for a kid. but it was only 5 bucks altogether to buy and it works fine
well fillion's voice sounds like bucks

At least not yet.

Garrus is batman in space with less moral compass <3
Anyone ever seen a pony based on the firefly cast?
Garrus is WAY hotter than Tali

It is a series of greatness
Eeyup.
you know what i'm wondering? i'm wondering why we didn't have this movie a whole fucking lot earlier
Garrus is male and is best BRO
Bjornfot: he's an armored bird
otakon: Because she's an awkward nerd and has a sexy voice
You know what? We should have a Brony Game night
Wait..
(i ain't gay tho)
Tali is still hot though.

Eight legged freaks is fucking AWESOME

Sweetie Belle got the restraining order on me because of Hot Coco

people say women dig scars. i think we have women in here so: is that true?
dat trunk
Gumri: they have very weak immune systems, they need to live in a controlled environment.
I'm not sure. but Anyone cane use the "Strange Eons" program to create their own custom content.
also, always wearing a suit prevents light from getting on your skin
It's like....he's trying to act sort of Southern...but not really.
Bjornfot: I don't think so, I'd say they probably look more like the Grays of UFO fame
It's a Trap
otakon: no
i dig women with scars, because men are eww.
XD
I kinda like sacrs on chicks, depending on the girl and where it is
So when their species were created they were created into suits?

Hmm, was the Trap meme active when this came out?
