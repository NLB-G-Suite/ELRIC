AJIsAwesome: Were you around during the premiere? Missed you during it
Eh
Please guys, I'm begging you. The more you make Gak a meme, the greater chance the whole idea of other products like this getting spammed for the point of making a cheap meme increases
the plan is to inject Gak into everything so people dont' complain about injecting ponies into everything...
Gak
Oh i know this episode

Socks: well you don't
lol
/me appologieses for all caps, it was neccicary

LOLIS
im sweing them together
DO IT
gakinated
J_E_Smith71: we do have side rooms...
I guess the idea that Rarity was going for was to represent her friends' personality at a formal event. The vision was for them to be more or less together since they are all so close.
WTF
I can relate
I'm Bak
Was in Mystery on the friendship exppress
Nah, Pinkie would most likely kill someone.

Thats kinda harsh
Well decades after the series went out of production, The Jetsons was a still a popular series in reruns.
Duh! They got fat and lazy from watching ponies
I think Ill be afk for this movie.
Or alternately, cowvarkian, just muting the daft thing and getting on with life. :P

What does this thing do 0_o
I like the 50's, 60's Idea of Futuristic Design, even though it also kinda looks 20, 30-ish
The movie was made during the 90s when everyone was still learning about CGI
Maybe a modern remake of this wouldn't fare too badly...
Fl00t4sh41, this movie is from 1990. Please don't hold the CGI to high standards
lol
suprising they didn't become like the fat people in Wall-E
they should be borgs

only a few shows from back then that used CGI were successful like Beast Wars

As far as I'm concerned, Astro is a retextured Scooby.\

Shizuka: That's the smart thing though, else they were able to get much more from him...now they don't expect more :)
I think the actress for Judy is a different person in the movie
Traffic in the air, seems legit
this is ilogic
kissing space ship
needs more ponies
can't you just fly up
Record_Discord, as far as I'm concerned Astro came in before Scooby
If only I could go down or over!

Dediucated to the memory of Mel Blanc.
Thank you Hanna Barbera. <3 For everything.
well, that was a bit music shift
flutterchu: shoot
/me The animation is superb, the soundtrack is awesome, but the story is very weak. It's just recycled plot lines from the TV series, and a half-assed, phoned-in moral. This was probably the final word on The Jetsons and they STILL didn't give Judy much development. Jetsons: The Movie could have been better. It's not GOOD, but it's not terrible. It's a proper send-off for the Jetsons, IMO 5.4/10
JUST NO
i can answer it
classic music
heh
Noone can stop....The Gaaaaak
FLutter go
Hanna Barbera sucks

Leadhoof: it's only open during the week
wait does Twilight have some kind of meme like Fluttershy is a tree Pinkie Pie is spy and Rarity is a marshmellow?
PArtly
Ah. Okay.

Rarity is a spy.

It has been foreshadowed with her Cutie Mark
Mainly because of the flying bits

THE GREAT CONE OF ANTICIPATION
YESSS
dat wall again
Sombra was less a villain, and more the shadow of one-- what was left was nothing but a memory of sheer evil. An insanely powerful memory, but...
ok its funny though the pic

Oh, and I watched Littlest Pet Shop. It wasn't MLP-- how could it be-- but neither was it Starberry SHortcake, and had a lot of very amusing moments.
Luna :3
Littlest Pet Shop was actually good
Don't like Gak? Have a floam. http://i.imgur.com/wd6kG.jpg
about to smoke a beezee (: yummy.......................JK.....Lol
(\(ಠ益ಠ)/) Y U NO﻿ Brush your teeth?
Except for Twilight Barkle
I enjoyed Twilight Barkle
Why would they degrade Twilight to a mutt
when will it start?
In seven days.
waaaaaaa
NEVER
im like recorindg ym playtrough of ponymon dusk
HERE HAVE A CADENCE http://i.imgur.com/38VvT.gif
Horn herpes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFe7eLwAXoc&feature=related idk what to say so heres a hand shadow performance
Nyra: The only thing that pup had in common with Twilight was coloration. Her mindset is totally different.
im amazed how fast this fandom is, gak is like the biggest thing today, bigger than the premiere
and what is dari doing?
http://i.imgur.com/pIOQx.jpg Gak gak gak
stop Kvetching chat >:I
"good things are better when they're a rarity" ;)<_<
sleeping
CrystalPhoenix: "GTFO!"
/me infects twilight_sprinkle with the gak
Gakpony: bbecause my teethe are white, and if i would just make them more white it would get racist.....adn toothpaste is'nt tasty.......:'(.......i got sick for 45 minute's....then I drank it again
I wish I could've watched Littlest Pet Shop. Unfortunately, they did a post-show for the episode that I really couldn't care less for.
CrystalPhoenix Best part of that episode
CrystalPhoenix: Okay, okay,. I'll help you find the kitchen, But I still need that sammitch.
GAK WONT BE POPULER
what happened to twilight barkle
DeathStgak: NOOOOOOOOO D:
whhy isnt shinning armors cuttie mark a javalin
God damn it
Kencolt, that quote....my sides are gone now
gak will die by next week.
thanks
gak will be like first
in fact, it got irratating about 3 hours in.
gak will die by tomorrow
gak is like gangnam, but still better
Gak is one of those 80's/90's fads
lol doubt it, people still use 20% cooler ffs
what now?
oh hai twilight_sprinkle
d3rb_, his special talent is making forcefields, not weapons
Gak isnt even a fun word to say....i can't even say it....this is fun to say, OBJECTION *backround music*
hey Invi :)
was gak's sudden populariy because of how much it was played?
/me noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
Oh is the feed over?
anyone got ideas for a pony playtrough?
flutterchu, it's like blargh
but 20% cooler was actually in an episode, gak was a kind of "you had to be there" kind of thing.
the gak makers will love hub now
Deacon: Pretty much.
i dont know if i shoud do welcome to ponyvile act 1
Deacon, yeah basically
pretty sure he is meant to be an ace javalin thrower or a SAM site
/me noms thelonepony back :3
in fact hub will probably get a lot of money for ths
Gilda more like someone's afk
the cutie game
where you applebloom
/me throws shark in chat
i don't even like gak but that doesn't mean i'm goin to stop saying it
story of the blanks
what do you do in the cutie game?
story of the blank flanks
/me hugs shark
as stupid as the meme is, if it persists, this will be good for the hub. more companies will want to advertise things on their channel.
Mystery of the druids
oh god
/me fights the shark with bare hoofs >:I
Yes, gak has no favor.
qwop pony had the best ending.
yeah...i can't really talk in real life because my tounge is sore from eating drinking or sucking everything a look at......but i can atleast type :)
So who else played Luna game with headset?
flavor*
twilight_sprinkle, Gangnam Style isn't a forced meme, though. It's really pretty darn catchy
somepony stream ponies
and then hub will become a sellout..
Mihoshika, what if you cook it?
Gakpony: what's Luna game
flutterbrony1234: never ask for ponies, trust me :S
?
twilight_sprinkle: witch will make it less likely for adds to repeat an emence number of times
add salt to Gak, it will have tons of flaver then
It doesn't gain taste, it just melts, then eventually starts to boil.
I can't wait until April 30, 2042 when the mongrels of that era gets to see the original gak inside the time capsule at Nickolodeon
g 3?
you dont want to know what luna game is
flutterbrony1234, a creepypasta game as far as i know
flutterbrony1234: worst
Kandarihu: idk, it doesnt really feel that forced, not today at least, in the future maybe
flutterchu,
^
Sorry guys gotta go eat some oats. Hopefully be back for S3. Choa.
Also, the gas is poisonous.
I loved the rarity and twilight hoof touch at the end of part 2. It was very sweet.
Gakpony: wat luna game?
it is non-toxic doe
;):)
Sooo many songs in the 1hour premier
3
mmm, cookie dough *drools*
also nonsense, always ask for ponies!
Invi: how is it scary when it involves Luna
oh that i played that before chizzed everywhere
I think we're starting to see more and more slight shipping-ish feelings amongst the Mane 6.
oh u sprunkls :3
For people who dont know what luna game is just google: Luna game end is neigh
oh look, you can actually read the chat
And somewhat prepare?
what a shocker
anyone know the name of that twilight looking dog?
I blame Twilight Sparkle playing around with the feelings of her reverse-harem
Twilight Barkle!
twighlit barkle
I think it's more bonding between each other rather than shipping-ish feelings.
soo uhhh whats going on
so how was that crystal cove episode?
Buytoast: It was ok.
well...I mean like real name in the show
wierd
was there another mary sue couple shooting love beams everywhere?
Buytoast: it was meh
oh god XD has everybody seen this? http://ask-gak-pony.tumblr.com/
Buytoast, this happened http://i.imgur.com/38VvT.gif
flutterchu, after playing it fills your desktio with creepy pinkie pics and also is the game after a few gameplay minutes getting creepy
Villain wasn't that great.
Buytoast: somewhat
buytoast, this time we had a tactical nu* I mean cadence...
This is the best stream ever.
twilight_sprinkle, the only reason it got any attention is because 4 short ads for it and related products were aired in a row. I admit that that is probably a perfectly innocent mistake. But we have to be careful not to give it too much attention or else the advertisers will try to replicate whatever success the Gak incident had.
that tiny.tv was the best stream
Dashie_Dashie: not as good as the buffershow
wish the DHX work on the villian more
Buytoast: silly kitty....i can read everything everybrony chat;s here on bronystate, i may be stupid as F**k, but i can read like a..................uh...............hmmm..........
taht*
that* :P
whenver a floam commercial came on the chat was flooded with floam inferior gak superior
King Sombra was the3 equivalen of an RPG final boss: you know it's there, but it doesn't do anything unless you confront it
tehlonpon, you silleh. :3
GAK :D
LIKE A CENTIPEDE!!!!!!!yes
i'm guessing you weren't here this morning, were you flutterchu?
I just realised. Shining Armor and Princess C doing a clssic Fastball Special!
I think Sombra did well to embody the tacit evil of the situation. Like Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty. He didn't really need all that much character development.
Deacon, pony_4908, please don't spoil the people who couldn't be here this morning.
What did sombrero even want? to eat crystals
ayejay no u ar sillieh :3
:3
Kandarihu: well while every particular advertiser will want it, different companies will see the potential and want their stuff to be aired, and so there will be more variety to the ads. they will try to make the ads catchy and memorable and have that shown
all sombra was saying was., MMMM crystal...
sombre looked like an OTT fancharacter. Not in a bad way.
Buytoast: nope....i fell alseep....it was really 6:00 when they aired the episode's not 10:00...they lied........so i just sat there.....wathed season 3......alone.......:'(
what the fuck do we do
So, when are they replaying the season premiere?
he has no caharacter to develop though pony_whatevernumber
Ifiredmylazar: Wait?
Really, the episode wasn't so much about Sombra as it was about Twilight, when you think about it. This season may show less charactr development and more power development.
flutterchu: theres next episode :)
and at one point, slaves. that's it
does this room have logs?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wl3lKJT3is&feature=youtu.be
i want to see the reactions from the episode this morning
I had many feels for spike at the door part.
thelonepony: i dont think i can wath it, is thanksgiving next week
That was horrible. :'(
?
I saw Chrysalis more as a Maleficent, Sombra was more like umm
Kencolt, spike and twily had charachter development. them episodes felt liek a prequel to something bigger...
Gakpony: Who wouldn't
i never liked Lauren's writers
So, when are they replaying the season premiere?
One moment for reactions...
they never go over their writings
Zamer, >Chrysalis
As soon as the host gets back to his computer?
flutterchu: thanksgiving is a week after nex week :P
pony_415680 if you're using the site's irc client, no, but if using a separate client like mirc, then yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOD39tCoA0
Zamer, >Not Nightmare Moon as Maleficient
was anyone here when the chat was flooded with the: TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHAFUCKA?
next*
anyone got a good pony game?
Sobra really had a very poorly developed motivation in my eyes. It was like, his whole point in being a sterotypical mustache-twirling cartoon villain was simply so that the episode could have a villain to drive the plot. :P
CrystalPhoenix: Throw your wife! (LIKE A BAWS)
soo, who is your favorite gak?
thelonepony: then i cant watcvh episode 4........personal reasons
The door part was probably the most emotional part in the episode and it actually made me cry when Twilight was crying near the window
twilight_sprinkle, and as long as they succeed at making catchy and memorable ads, the memes they create will be natural. That's advertising done right. The Gak ads that we saw this morning were only notable for their repetition. And they became a meme, at least for today. If that becomes something to exploit, that would be advertising done wrong
DarknessPony: get the gameloft pony game for ios and android
Mihoshika: horrible quality, i was looking for another video
Oh :P
Omigosh Trixie is coming back.
mic
And omigosh Scootaloo episode.
i hear... somehting
some ponies just want to watch the world burn :)
Chrysalis is Ursula, Nightmare Moon is Maleficient, Sombra is.....something
wooo
nobody here records logs?
Dari..
I don't get the Gak thing. Yes it was advertised a lot, but it wasn't THAT funny. ._.
oh sht hes awake?
Im gonna cry in Sleepless in Ponyville it makes me wanna hug Scootaloo :'(
Dabi
if only i could stream.......
gakobowl
what is going on
who is favorite Gak?
CriticKitten: It kind of floored te international community.
what is that noice
who is talking?
thanks i might even record all of the pony games iv played
Rainboom: whuh........why?
he be talking to someone
Those were pings
is he back?
Kencolt: They're easily amused then. There are so many much worse commercials.
i heard voices
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/33610
oh gawd i can only imagine the number of tf2 gak sprays
Kandarihu: yeah, it will be exploitable as long as there arent many ads to be shown. but if more companies catch on to this, they might offer hub their own ads, which will cause more variety. the worse possibility is other companies dont notice it but the ones that already have a contract with hub will, and theyll spam it like today
flutterchu: Not allowed to say spoilers but ik what the episode is about you can look it up on Wikipedia
Fallout Equestria: The novel 50000 pages
CriticKitten: Yes. but not four times in a row. Someone at the HUB is getting yelled at a LOT>
I would say she was Ursala in the beginning, but once the wedding actually started she became Malecifient
i wanna see a movie
who was on here last night?
HAMMERHEAD YAK ATTACK
DABI :O
ya know with the green glowing eyes, green magic fire all around her
dabi eez ded
I hope we get to see Trixie outside of her Trixie persona for once!
I stayed for Movie Night watching How To Train Your Dragon
Wanderer sorry, movies are kind over, they'll be back next week though
sprunkls ;^;
Giving applejack the job to lie to other ponies >_>
matt smith ate him :>
:D
ikr XD
the mic is on
i watched How to Train Your dragon but slept trough Jetstones half of it
Kencolt: But that's just it, it's not that bad by comparison to normal commercials. Just got repeated a lot.
:D:P
Gakpony: AJ didn't lie even once, SHe just avoided a few facts.
Look, there's a moose! >_>
twilight_sprinkle, there are already a lot of companies offering their ads to The Hub. It's not like it's a fledgling network being built from scratch. Even from the beginning, The Hub was merely the channel formerly known as Discovery Kids.
OH BOY A............oh wait....i forgot
i heard 2 different voices
that took a long time
A GIANT HAMMERHEAD YAK
So what is happening now?
plus the Hub is mainly a Giant Toyad block
AGGGH the pings
a giant hammerhead gak?
Kandarihu: Which nopony watched... Oh, I see.
Flutterknight needs to be canon (you know besides FlutterTree FlutterRage and Flutterbitch)
thats a Traffic Cone!
Kandarihu: i guess, although i havent notced much variety in their ads in any case
oh and Flutterguy
There is da punch?
AJIsAwesome: Sonny's stream is on
I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter C
TRAFFIC COOOOOOOOOOOOONE
A GIANT HAMMERHEAD YAK RIDING A HAMMERHEAD WHALE
Deacon: Chatbox?
Flutterclop.........(fanfics)..........had to read them all.....i had no choice :'(
I still have to say
twilight_sprinkle, there are ads targetted at boys, girls, and parents.
Floam and Gak are like the Black Mesa and Aperture Science of toy sludge.
an empire controled by emotion is quite original
Implying the portal gun doesnt use Gak
Invi: Yeah but she was a knight with RD in S3
come on we need streaming
Rainboom actually card games
AGREED PON-3
Card games?
The idea was probably to make sure one got out whileleaving room for local cable providers to add local ads.
Kandarihu: i didnt mean age variety, i meant overall variety, as in just amount of different ads
Rainboom, ja then, there ya go ^^
lets play eye-spy
Yay
if only there was an OLYMPICS episode in MLP....THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/433470-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic#comments
hey everypony :)
I spy with my little eye something black
Rainboom if you watched the new episode of YGOTAS, it'll make sense
hoi Sketch_Toku_Brony
Oh funny note, for the Dan Vs. S3 commercial where he has to press a button for everything he hates
You know, the Gak thing wasn't even new today. Skip to the 10:37 mark: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiz95K1ngiI&feature=g-high-u
flutterchu: there was that one iron pony episode
I spy with my little eye something orange with white on it
CrystalPhoenix, digimon has a whole parallel universe controlled by emotion ^^
Pinkie Pie is the only exception
:[You are going to Love Me!:[
Invi, SHUSH YOU
Floam and Gak probably have shady origins.
Gakpony: whuh?
Rainboom, is it a traffic cone on your computer?
CrystalPhoenix :D
TRAFFIC CONE! Am I right?
twilight_sprinkle, the only ad that actually generated memes for it's own content is a network spot for Pound Puppies. That's where we got the Secret Butt Fun ad.
well i might record this live stream
Gakpony: i dont remember one episode called iron man who what not.....
DerpyClub2: Ding ding ding!
WHAT ABOUT GAK!?
yayz
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PQe07mXSKA&feature=g-all-c
flutterchu: you know the episode where RD and AJ were just doing competitions and what not
:3
and punch holes in the sky
PUNCH HOLES IN THIS GUY!
and hate on gamefly
So whatthe heck is this stream?
Gak is just a biproduct from the rainbow factory... ;)
Kandarihu: yes, although i would hope other ads dont become memes due to unintentional sexual jokes
Is there a problem or did the stream stop I just came back here.
It's a mircale...yes I know I know I'm not dead. :|
Stream stopped
ok
I spy with my little eye something that is secret but its fun (guess where that came from ik your gonna guess it in ten seconds flat though)
miracle
he is eating sleeping wait if it says on Air
He probly doing something?
but what?
Rainboom: Pound Puppies?
i thought this was going on for 24 hour
s
5 more minutes.
I hope he knows he's live.
I've just watched the new ep, it was AMAZING!!
who here saw the season premier of littlest pet shop?
DerpyClub2: You are on fire! Oh wait I forgot *gets matches and lighter*
twilight_sprinkle, indeed. I remember the Madoka Magica fandom launched a meme for Morning Rescue, just for being hillariously out of place for the show it was sponsoring.
He probably got stuck in the toilet again
and I did DerpyClub2
now i know how painful it is to smoke.....
Gak is the sludge they scrape out of the bottoms of the spectra vats.
he probably is still asleep from the jetsons movie
/me noms on cigarette
/me throws match on DerpyClub2 NOW you on fire! :D
it wasnt all that bad zamer
/me burns his/her mouth
tand also
:'(
tAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
>_>
Kandarihu: ah well ive never heard about that fandom or that ad, but yeah
*trollface*
OH YEAH
Hello Everypony :) Back down to a managable number I see
*le pony face*
derpyclub2 dies
http://i.imgur.com/vMV15.png CUTEST PINKIE MOMENT EVER

Everyone type this in the chat just for the fun of it. Type:SonicRainboom:D
Me and my rl friend were in the Fluttershy room reacting to S3
we're all zombies
zamer, yeah first episode was pretty good, second episode was predictable
you are imagining everyone.
CrystalPhoenix: Especially the part when the confetti and streamers reversed back into the cannon. :D
there should still be the second episode an dthe re airing of the premiere
I hope Pinkie gets to keep a flugelhorn.
IntenseLycan: i just lost IQ points looking at that
the fluttershy room?
Zippoman924: Im gonna be in for a world time of pings
of course people are still here
We need something to wakehim up

I hope we get to see more flugelhorn in future episodes. :D
I hope that pinkie pie commercial isn't gunna actually happen in an episode
Party cannon is now an offical weapon
Dashie_Dashie: it doesnt have to be from here
Don't forget about the actual real Horses in the commercial
DerpyClub2: Hi hey hey y u so weird :O
Gak Attck Gak Attack Gak Attack, the sludg tht got back. Gak Gak.

GAKOIDS INVADING GAK

Rainboom: cause i choose to be so,
Everyone stop typing for 15 sec lets see if it will clear up any lag people are getting in the chat
Dark_Horst, after the premiere were 2 episodes and 2 movies. what else do you want? ^^
My Little Pony has horses now?!?!?! :O
Gak is what happens when a batch of Bad Dragon items receives far too much softener.
...so did Ticket Master and the encore get canned?
GAK! MORE GAK! MOAR GAK!! Pinkie thats a lot of Gak
MASF123 well they are horses

Yes I said it, now you'll be thinking about that during the commercial when kids are playing with Gak.
Moar Aj plz.

Miss_Rarity: Do you know about LIL Miss Rarity?
Alright guys. Enough hating on the Gak. Enough LOVING on the Gak. That was just a freakish accident that happened this morning. The sooner we move on, the better.
Hey you better be careful or you will get sued by the Dale Corporation Rarity
Lol I should buy a bunch of Gak, then send Bad Dragon a customer service complaint that my item is melting... then send them a bunch of Gak in a box.
Anyone else die laughing when spike just jumped off the building?
Haters gonna hate Ponies gonna Pwn
can someone make a crystal derpy PLEASE
the person streaming fell asleep me thinks
Okay, it wasn't a freakish accident. It was just a funny accident.
Miss_Rarity: I would love to have 20 mins of either Applejack or Apple Bloom talking about apples constantly.
I hope he wakes up
wow gak remixes too
I DIED OF LAUGHING WHEN PINKIE'S HEAD TURN INTO A G3 VERSION OF HERSELF OMG I WAS DYING OF LAUGHTER

Since the stream is effectively dead, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEDjAFi7oJ4 another case of badly placed advertisements
yup, stream is braindead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajc1GfwFIxY&feature=g-hist heres to watch the best reference of MLP EVER
hmm, what was everyone's opinion on the fanmade episode Dusk Dawn?
Where are the mods.
I'm a LumberGak and I'm okay. I sleep all night and I work all day.
it wouldnt be "my little human" sounds kinda scientific. would probably be something like "my little ladies" or something wierd like that. ;)
gonna play some Maplestory
man i cant wait to see what S3 has in store :$
My Little Bronies.
Miss_Rarity, my little ladies and gentlemen :D
either that or im going on 15 minutes sleep
Wailord is best pony
my little ladies sounds rather pimpish though.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6cPSKLRR2A Here's something amusing for everyone
my little wailord.
Yes it does.
what we really need is 3500 all of us in here on skype chatting while Season 3 is on
My little Amnesia
Pinkie: Betcha cant make a crazy face like THIS!!! *Generation 1 Pinkie Pie head* Rarity and Fluttershy: O_o?? xP

My tiny miniture small people who I call midgets show.
Mods are asleep, post gak.
/me bows down to Princess_Celestia
pony_702: its meh
Watching the MLP this morning was a fucking disaster for me.. couldnt get into chat and it was lagging every fucking 10 seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zuuETLum_E
Gak: the second coming of Shmooze
dont think ive ever been as disappointed.
Is Gak still a thing?
wasnt for me
GAK GAK GAK
I heard it ended in a 2-parter.
yay :)
apparently
Im still waiting for Trollestia to upload the reactions of S3
Lord Smooze? Where?
Yeah, chat this morning was insane. It locked me out about 6 times.
chat is dead. post something controversial
same rainboom
bannana phone
Controversal you say/
The first actual Bronystate reaction to Gak...which was a few weeks ago (Watch the 10:37-14:26 mark): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E5YM_SPDBI
floam is better than gak >_>
Well. While mods are asleep. Shall we discuss the film im producing. With the full permission of Hasbro?
I want to watch season 3 but I don't, I want to watch it on here >_>
IM NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR
I was disappointed by the complete non-development of King Sombra and intrigued by some of the new plot threads they set up.
Ok what do ya'll think that book Luna had was all about?
Dashie_Dashie: Too late.
J_E_Smith71, AW YEAH
did anyone see the easter egg in S3
~I wanna be a pop star / Because then you'll let me get more engrossed in you / A shining pop star /Spreading my wings, I'll cast a spell only on you!~
DocSane: exactly what plot threads?
Lunas book was starswirl the bearded
king sombra was just there to be evil. period.
when can we do that
Starswirl will make an appearence in S3, just sayin.
does anypony know what won the lottery today?
but is she takeing over as Twilights teacher ?
Princess Platinum.
Sombra was used for the essence of fear
bitches love starswirl.
IshBaneVoicePony no idea
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: Well, what is "the next step" for Twilight? Why was Luna so nervous about exposing her to the magic in the Crystal Empire? What was in Luna's black book that she magicked up at the end.
Whelp I'll be going now. I only came to say "Hi" and add friends onto that MLP Mobile game which didn't work out so well.
star wars refer was not in S3 >_>
and Princess platinum was beautiful. ;)
when DOES rarity need underwear
somebody wake him up
Well, since the stream is STILL dead...
GET THE FUCK UP

Calm down people >:I
Spoilers: Twilight Sparkle will become Starswirl the Bearded in an accidental timeportal accident that leaves her trapped in the past
Why dont we Do an after dance party on skype?

LESS PINGING, MORE PONIES.

MASF123: Not helping /)_-
DocSane: because Writers are trying to make it seem dramatic
SQUISH GAK BLOW GAK STRETCH GAK SOUNDS REALLY WRONG TO ME O_o
when we find Derpy SpirittHoove
They were supposed to after the Jetsons Movie, but that ended like, a half an hour ago.
Nyra: I'm guessing that "yes" is the answer.
They should make a song with all the pinging.
also PING GAK DERP
GAK GAK GAK
Nyra, what if all villians will reappear at once together :O
SpirittHoove would be kinda right now after the movies ended, but it seems like our streamer is afk

/me ragdolled
Why am I getting pinged.
the pings keep happening in a pattern
The main thing that bothered me about the Andrew WK panel is that Andrew seemed like he was really coked up.
the closer the pings, the closer you are to death
Andrew w k wrote a song called get ready to die
ready to die
"coked up"
cupcakes
slenderpings?
This would require an alliance of Nightmare Moon, Discord, Queen Chrysalis, the Flim Flam Brothers, Trixie, Gilda, and Diamond Tiara. And I'm probably missing somepony.
Who, me?
no cupcakes
Excuse me?
ANYONE IN HERE LIKE HORSE PORN?

Hey
In all Honesty this chat can turn fairly dark when......................ESPECIALY when black people show up :S
.........
Shiuka I suppose, however theres only 231 people in chat, no one really says he should be banned, he had done nothing, and nothing innapropriate is playing only a scientific documentary...
rainbowdash is bored
Omggg that would be awesome
Hi Spyrofan001 :)

GIK RA DA
13i used to be a pony like you
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
friendship is gak
13until i took a GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
we jump out the windo like gak gak gak
you know what gak really is? HORSE SEMEN
My little Gak: Gak is magic
Shizuka: :<
Ok. Thats settles it. S4 Villain will be GAK, Stretcher of Worlds.
:'(
...*grunt*
gak the name of the frist cell
kidzrul732: so have some coffee its awesome and will make you feel better more than likely
Whats this Gak pony stuff? Go to a meetup for approx 11 hours and I missed quite a bit
im planiing to talking to Activison about my spyro game idea
Gak is the best thing ever
Cypresswolf: You don't want to know.
ah ok
ill exlin gak if your couriuos
^^
Well it couldn't hurt
its about spyro and his mate (u chose from Cynder or Ember)
gak is a toy
XylemTube: so were Moonshoes, but I digress :)
All he would say is GAK IS BACK.
Cypresswolf: there were four commercials of it during the ponies stream
they ran too many commercialls
ok ok I know that you people had gak as kids but can you stop bringing it up?!
13Cypresswolf: apparently someone at the hub thought it was a good idea to run a commercial for Gak four times in a row in one break
13and floam
^
gak is liquid awesome
Cypresswolf: Long story short, some Gak commercials kept appearing in a row. SO often that people decided to make a meme out of it.
I remember Gak :) it was fun in the 90's
13the episode seems to have sucked enough that gak became more popular
Cypresswolf: that is true.
Cypresswolf: The Hub ran a bunch of Gak ads today during the new episode one after the other and it triggered a bunch of chat spam and for some reason it broke out into a chat spam meme
lol
Cypresswolf: When the HUB first showed the new eps this morning, they had a plethora of commercials for Floam and Gak-- two old toys rereleased after more than a decade. In particular, for some reason, four GAK commercials were shown in a row. It sort of took off.
Shizuka: people are bawwwwing about the villain
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/246/7df.png
13from what i've heard, i don't blame them
its a pladow/gell like toy on a 1800 infromershal that repeted alot during the stream pepole spamed it so much it became a new meam
Hey everpony
I saw the gak commercial air twice - most of the commercials were covered with Houston Brony videos
So are you gonna try to get them to make it, or do you want permission to make a fangame or something?
Shizuka: Well, the villain didn't even speak a full sentence from what I remember.
yea
13an entire region of the continent and its associated villain appears out of thin air and goes away by the end of the episode?
00,02floam + gak = ?
villian was not entertaining enough, so we got attached to GAK instead
13mare do well had better writing if that was the case
flak?
Keep this up and this will become GAKSTATE
is the gak comercial on youtube
you get to create there kids personality like the sims but u acttile get to play it in 1st person or 3rd person
Shizuka: I don't think the villain was the point of the episode :I
floam + gak = Portal to Equestria.
villain no good
Shizuka: The writing for the magic used was very, VERY well done though...
Phase4: Goam
Cypresswolf: We got to see the raw feed. You saw from a local cable, so there was room to add local commercials-- which is usually the intent.
Everypony freaked out at the Baby Alive commercial *shudders*
00,02pony_2073, :D
so exciting
GAK = G Version of FRAK
i already solved this equasion
Gak x Floam <3
wtf...
equation
is this guy
saying
13Iwa: well the cold open turned me off
kidzrul732: too late, it's actually dolanstate
that would be so amazing
:P
I thought the episodes were pretty good
As i said i missed the premiere
S3 will be a questionanle one....story wise...
im going to have them make it because i know nothing about creating games because im only 14
:(
what will happen?
that's it I'm going to bed, and i expect this gak bullshit to be over tomorrow when I wake up
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rq9ud/
!!
NEVER
Shizuka: Well...like they say, can't please everyone :)
Will it end up like...
kidzrul732: your optimism is tasty
You mean when you wake up covered in Gak.
bad or good?
or im going to have my friend get promission to make it and he can make it for me
Also
lol
13but it opens with "IT has returned", i paused the video and thought "really? they're seriously going with that open?"
Cypresswolf Shizuka: This wasn't the first time the Hub showed so many Gak ads. It actually happened the first time four weeks ago during a rerun of Winter Wrap Up. However it didn't trigger spam since the chat only had a few people.
Shizuka: well they just sent Twilight to deal with it :D
13and then i did other things and haven't finished the eps
I project the gak phenonenom will continue untill sometime late next week
GGAAKK
theres won vilon that cant defeat
The villian from s3 was the first one to actually be kileld
when the real first episode of season 3 will be shown
evaporated to nothing
We basically did react to the fact they played so many but then dropped it when the episode started again
00,02Shizuka, yeah, show's still clever but it was a bit contrived
Shizuka: as a rule, we cant talk about the new episode til at least tomorrow right?
You might be able to get some people to help you out if you make a couple of posts here and there
Shizuka: finish it later so you can give examples about how it sucked :D
13Cypresswolf: see i haven't seen it so :3
GAK will never end.... we already have a GAK ask pony site!!!!!!!!!!
13i can't spoil what i haven't seen
The episode gave me my fix. That is all.
GakISBESTPONY: And I'm not so sure about that. At the last moment we see the fragmented tip of Sombra's horn spin off-- colored bright crimson. He may be back.
It's Gakception
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rq9v6/
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
maybe..
My lips are sealed :)
GakISBESTPONY: His horn remained, and he can control magic with his detached horn so he might have survived
thelonepony: I know, right?
But it seemed alot like that blast woulda kileld him
im going to try
but whatever
13k enough ep discussion, science time
it's a kids show, I'm sure he isn't dead..
lol
he was defeated
that must take forever

I don't want to get in trouble for copyright, so should I put something
13hundred billion galaxies
i'll put unofficial
13each with hundred billion stars
MAGIC IS SCIENCE (that we havent explained yet)
13and you all think we're alone in the universe?
so mank aliens
Shizuka: IKR
That's one journey I'd love to partake in
ITS SO PREDICTABLE
My Little Universe: Galaxies are Magic
k
^
^^
yes it has science looks like magi to a primative cluture
heck no im going to creat a starcraft and find equestria out there!
MAYBE THOSE GUYS ON KOLOB KNOW
statistically there is other life out there
THOSE KOLBIANS KNOW ALL
DERRP
Shikuza: we'd still need life close enough and within the same timeframe of our own species' existance if we want to meet them :)
K Guys lets set off and find the planet GAK
My Little Multiverse: Fandom is magic
science is gak
Equestria must be found :X
nickrod808: ..... no
That moment you realise there could be a planet inhabitted by sentient equines
ok ill be back lata
Starsv are made ofGAK
There is likely other life out there, maybe even sentient, but making contact across such distances seems incredably unlikely.
symphonyofscience makes good videos with this kind of stuff
just... now
no*
What the FUCK is with the obsession with Gak in this fandom today?
Eddmario: I HAVE NO IDEA.
eDD
Eddmario: ikr?
During the stream
So there was a commercial for it during the premiere...
Kinixys: and those that could would probably be beyond our imagining.
You had to be there
four commercials in a row
Eddmario: Nearly all the ads during the premier were for Gak.
Eddmario: That played four times in a row.
00,02^
FOUR
I think gak is a meme or something
are space craft the ss GAK
Eddmario: four different commercials. Still, the fad has no reason to be
Hell I was there and I don't get it.
DerpyMuffins: It already is.
Directer gak
GAKGAKGAK x 4
AS CELESTIA AS MY WITNESS I WILL FUCKING HUNT DOWN EQUESTRIA IN THIS UNIVERSE
11,01And the Obama killed our space program.
Ohai NT|TF2 :D
Eddmario: Not A commercial. Four in a row. Hammered in our face.
I thought it was Bush who cut the funding?
^
Hi NT|TF2 :)
*^^
wolf IM WIT U
^^^^*
god
half the commercials were gak, a fourth were floam
11,01Hi.
Kencolt: I was here during the episode stream, and it didn't play 4 times in a row.
:[
that was wonderful..
Who Killed Pluto again?
that
13that's halfway through cosmos btw
Yo NT|TF2 , you still playing TF2?
was amazing
I just wish the EU would get it's space program into gear.
3 times in a row I believe
SpirittHoove:/)
AMAZING 80's CREDITS
Gak killed Pluto
GASDFSDFSDF
about 9 in total during the episode
yea obam likes science he takes gloabl warming serisly
OBEY THE 80's
00,02Universe is a big place
Shizuka: DOes this mean we're almost FINALLY done with all the boring school videos?
Can you imagine the first flag on Mars to be a Union Jack? or the blue EU flag? :p
wolf (\
oh
pony_2073 No there were much more Floam commercials, atleast four in a row
this one already exists
http://www.reddit.com/r/spyro
it's not like NASA had much of a budget when Bush was in office either
that's why I don't understand why FLoam isn't the meme >.>
FIRE!!!!!
Thanks for stream Shizuka

Rainbow--Dash: Be ause we're used to Floam. Everyponny is uded to floam. Gak caught a lot off-guard.
So yeah, maybe make a post there about the game
GAK GAK
Wasn't Gak from before Bush became pres?
Hey yall

Gak is the new Smooze.
Incase you are new here, every theatre you'r in has the same stream :P

This is the WHOLE stream.

I guess I'm out. Bye guys.
LORD OF THE GAK
i did not even know there was a gak vaccum
This meme is getting old.....
Zamer: Not THAT far back, because I know my little brother should remember it, and he was born in 96
children...time to tell a story...
Kind of nice that there isn't a spam. chat
it's back for it's 20yr anniversary reign
Or maybe the one with the brony stole the other's nick, so the real one had to change it to phony. :O
movie names with gak go
THE STORY OF GAK
I wasn't suprised by Gak because the Hub did the same thing three weeks ago
And annoying
Sticky hand > Gak
yeah, also try posting it in /r/gaming first
GAK
will the real SuperBrony please stand up
The Gak
STARTED IN THE 80's
Eddmario google Gak 90s ad
a long long time ago
Well your fasion is getting old!
or after and put (X-post from /r/spyro)
the courous case of bejaman gakon
we didn't have the internet back then!!!
/me blasts Phase4
OMG
that old eminem song
so
Phase4: :D
ya we did
/me curls up near fireplace
actually we did have internet back in the 80s
it was just small
i haz a plus hat ouo
also I found a game to play if you're bored: http://www.sporcle.com/games/starvingturkey/spyro-the-dragon-soundtrack
I didnt have internet til around '95
so our gak
was our only entertainment except masturbating to barbie dolls
The original selling point of Gak, back in it's earliest days on Nickelodeon, was that you cuold make it fart. No, seriously.
Gak was preventing us from becoming gay
ah now Gak has invaded winter wrap up and its playing in my head :S
Why are there so many terrible GAK puns
/me noms on Domo's + Hat :3
thelonepony: aasdfasd xD
wasn't the internet originally DARPANet?
i get they made the product in the 80s but the meam is new becuse thir was no internet back then
Hai Domo
kill bill comes to mind
So GAK was more important then god and religion
Oh hey Celestia. Oh you want to place your wing over me next to this comfy fire. Yes I will snuggle up with you.
/me puts hand/hoof in flame
You know what kids used to do before the internet?
DerpyMuffins: Hey there~
crimson: because gak rymes with many things
God was considered pointless to GAK
Hello Domo :) ponies! :D
Winer Gakup
Hi, Domo! :)
Cypresswolf: watch tv
mane chat and their Gak /)_-
GAK
*Winter
Cypress don't finish that statement
time for them to die
Hello hello~ :3
but it will soon die :3
But then came the legendary time of... the 90'S
You don't known what dangers you will unleash
Ohai DeathStar :)
i can't even answer them haha
i think i just gaked on the floor
Wouldnt that be amazing if you could snuggle up with Celestia.
hi MadSurge
And the 90's took GAK AWAY
Cypresswolf: Play with Gak?:p
They used to go outside and use something called an imagination to create games
hi Domo ^_^
FOREVERR
@Deathstar and play nes
Hi DeathStar :)
kIDS BECAME STRAIGHT! GAK WAS GONE! AND THE INTRENT WAS USED IN UR HOUSE
or atari
DOOM WAS MADE
pony_2073: XD true
AND SO WAS HALF-LIFE
hi thelonepony
And GAK was gone...
brb
for 20 years...
and now in the 20th century we brought it back
but then...
yea
in the 21st century
ooo fire
but it will still be posted like crazy
k
may i ask why we are watching a video about a fireplace
FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE
The world would be a lonely place for me without the internet, sorry to say
Yep. Unfortunately.
it will be a dead body dragged around
GAK CAME BACKKK
This is the most epic fireplace ever!
tf are we watcching
no one to talk pony with
Zamer: because.... the streamer wanted us too
wow so vivid
Just like the arrow jokes.
.............
this is almost as good as the buffer show
those still go on
GAK WOULD BECOME THE ULTIMATE RACE....CRUSHING ALL....AND IT TOOK IT'S THRONE BACK OF THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE
Aparently, my muncle told me they film this outside
and its been a year
Gak and ponies are the only thing that lowers my urge to kill....and were all out of ponies :'(.........so leave my GAK ALONE:[
Zamer: becasue its cold in the chat and we're freezing without it

WinterSpeed: Pinkie Pie!
NIGHTMARE MOON WASNT GOOFY, BUT I FELT MORE THREATENED BY HER LAME WAYS OF SCARING THE PONIES THAN I DID THE EVIL KING
lol
WinterSpeed: It's basically the things that give you nightmares or will haunt you.

Allegr0: I'll be a special guest :D
I DONT EVEN REMEMBER HIS NAME, THATS HOW BAD HE WA

I've seen very bad pinkie stuff
SYEAH, MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK AGAIN
What The GAk
so what is the pic?
I REALLY NEED TO TRY AND FIX IT ONE OF THESE DAYS
0,14=_=
His name was King Sombra. >_>
this chat just got GAKED
He was OK, but he wasn't really a great villain.
"BRB i need water"<======righ there
At least his name is spanish for darkness
WinterSpeed: Pinkie Pie showing us a face trick.
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe, if it wasn't for Cadence there would be no chance to save the crystal ponies
ok i fixed it for now
my point still remains, I didnt remember his name because he didnt leave an impression on me
[SWAG]Haku: if it gets stuck hold shift so you dont have caps
he wouled be a better villon if they go back to him in futuer episode
I wan see .o.
CrystalPhoenix: lolwut
Shut up Dovah
Cards against humanity broke me
NOOOO
NOOO

Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
Or maybe because your memory is bad. He wasn't that great of a villain but they uttered his name numerous times.
TO THE MOON
NO!!!!! ;3;
GAK Atatck
Now, if they bring the eveil king back for the season finale, that would redeem him
O_O
nooooooo
D:
Nuuuuuuuuuuuu
So there's no reason you SHOULDN'T know it.
really? :'(
WinterSpeed: You can see it at EQD. Its in one of the adverts for the new MLP season.
:'(
TO THE MOOOOOOONAAAAAAA!
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Waaaaaaaaat
:<
Last?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
well that's a surprise
:'(
;__;
This was my first time watching :(
Darn it!!!!! ;~;
COME BACK TO US I SHALL PAY YOU DOUBLE
Yo Allegr0 its wrong to advertise other streaming sites
okaay
...Darn.
Allegr0:...............why?
WHAT
:'( Me to Lil
im confused
link to new site?
but for now, the flim flam brothers remain better villains than Sombra
Allegr0: Go. DIE!!!! :[
were will you go to!?
The Flim Flam Brothers are NOT villains.
dat SplitmediaLabs
GAK
Dovah: nice period, you must have had a great education
Y...You won't be staff anymore ;~; ?
Are GigabotHarmonie and Allegr0 still be around and do random streams?
0,14I'm gonna miss you guys ;_____;
^
also I am back :P
^^^
Why do people continue to misunderstand what that term means?
;_;
^^^^^
;~;
WOOHOOO
I assure you we'll be around. :)
CritticKitten Precisely
:'(
there's always a crazy consipiracy
Allegr0: all good things have to come to an end....am I right?
/me clings to GigabotHarmonie D:
0,14NOOOO
/me hugs everypony.
/me and Allegr0 too!
hey everyone :)
0,14DON'T LEAVE MEEEEEEE
IT'S A CONSPIRACY, I TELL YOU!
/me hugs GigabotHarmonie back ;~;
Haha, it's not the end, just a new beginning!
Hi, RainbowPie. :)
:)
/me licks AdamTheDuck
/me hugs GigabotHarmonie back ;^;
Haku: You're attempting to assert that the guy who enslaved an entire race and cursed it for a thousand years isn't a villain?
Good luck.
Ohai RainbowPie ;~;
/me hugs Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie
i guess one thing im glad about missing the premiere is the gak commercial
Bronycon in baltimore.... why...
Don't leave Saxy! He gets to make the posts about your show on the homepage! D:
ohai RainbowPie ;~;
/me ties GigabotHarmonie and Allegr0 to the webservers
Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
Im not saying the guy wasnt evil, I get that he totally was
Get better GigabotHarmonie
0,14yeah, what XAX said!
/me throws love to GigabotHarmonie
I live in NY and I never got to go to it
I get that he's not a well executed villain, don't get me wrong.
the hell, bronycon
But claiming he's flat out not a villain is just stupid.
where is bronycon?
Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
But what they showed of him just wasnt... satisfying. We shaw a flashback of him as a tirant, but what about now?
Baltimore!
:'(
Can't Bronystate just play Celestia Radio on the stream when you do the show so we can still hear it Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie?
0,14I'm gonna miss making those posts ;____;
Baltimare*
:'(
what is the noise!?
I wont be able to get there!
He was still a villain, but what he did in his state justw asnt very good
I had to go afk but I have one question to ask before you go
SaxyPretender: where are you going?
Similarly, comparing him to antagonists like the Flim Flam Brothers, who merely scam people out of their money, is also rather ridiculous.
I was looking for it to be near Manehattan, but I guess not.
0,14I'm not going anywhere, but the show is ;____;
J_E_Smith71: What are we, stream stealers?!
There's a difference between Antagonist and Villain.
/me Hugs SaxyPretender
Gilda was an antagonist
I feel terrible now that I missed last weeks episode :(
Scoot-Scootaloo: Well you played off of Celestia Radio this morning for the preshow discussion
hello everypony... GAK
Discord was a Villain.
Hi, valoreins. :)
CriticKitten Look, all im trying to say is that the flimflam brothers came off as more villainious than Sombra did as a cloud
hi valoreins :)
J_E_Smith71: that's because we we're woriking with them! :P
0,14again, link to the show's Twitter: https://twitter.com/PixelPonyShow
hello valoreins
Haku: Except that they're NOT villains.
Hooray for da new season :D!
And to even put the two in the same tier is absurd.
But they were antanotgist
Holy Crap CrystalPhoenix is overreactly so hard
Because they're clearly not.
my day is made
wat
I misspelled that, but the fact remains
*clap**clap**clap*
speaking of the new villain... http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/188/77c.jpg
Ponies47, looks like you have a banner to edit
(and for what it's worth, the Flim Flam Brothers are rather lame antagonists anyways)
they were antagonists, just like sombra
valoreins, he's kinda growing on me
No, not fact.
valoreins: I didn't mind him.
what does that smilie face button do?
someone please calm me down? i feel like spoiling the next episodes
and someone on 4chan describe his badassery http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/179/7f1.png
true he wasn't much personality wise but has a threat he's interesting
Valorein: I like him just really wished he developed more
My day was made this morning... anyway Prince Sombras wasn't very good.. I didn't like his design and he only said 5 or 6 lines.
Allegr0: wait, what is your reasoning for leaving?
They were LAME antagonists, but I still felt more afraid of them than I did of Sombra
i think sombra was a badass
You are mistaking your opinion (that the villain of these episodes is "less villainy" than the Flim Flam Brothers) with fact (that the Flim Flam Brothers are NOT villains, but Sombra clearly is(
*).
how much longer do we have to listen to this?
...how
Ugh CritticKitten youre missing my point
we still have new people here
why
No History, for a person that means a big deal, is truely not a person
answer me why
A lot of Spike luvers loved how Spike 'saved the day'.
No, I get your point, it's just a very dumb point.
Cause they want to torment you.
:)
Hello!
I wanted to know. What Text to Speech program did GigabotHarmonie use tonight?
oh shush, Jmo. :D
now it's only darkness ahead
!cd
Aint nobody aint got time for this
Next episode air time is unknown.
oh tom..
CriticKitten: no need to insult
I say Twi and her friends saved the day, with an assist of spike.
You're comparing two vulture capitalists to a guy who enslaved an entire race and saying "yeah, those two are pretty scary"
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
[SWAG]Haku, because you had too much fate of Cadence or maybe you couldn't imagine what he could do if he was able to suceed
unknown? why?
alright then
that noise is back again!
@Tom, it's Saturday @ 10:30 AM EST
to any newcomers
somebody upsdate tom
congradulations bronies we have created the weirdest meme... GAKGAKGKAGAKGKAGKAKGAKGAKGKAK
tnx for the podcasts here on bronystate Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie <<3
rainbowfan: tom is a bot
gak gak gak
6_9
if you'd like to stay, behave, stay classy and have fun
its gak gak gak
Scoot-Scootaloo: well i dont know to either thank you or be mad at you
Keep bronystate bronystate
Again, I get it. Sombra was a piss poorly written villain who latched onto the most cliche of mannerisms.
oh. kk
that "Gak" shit is getting old.
CrystalPhoenix: lol man calm the hell down, you're giving me a heart attack :D
superretroworld: <3
What's with the gak? That ad is on all the time on the Hub. XD
Our twitter is: @pixelponyshow, our email is pixelperfectponyshow@gmail.com
i mean people made gak remix songs and gifs
Dark_Horst: thanks for the intel.
But it's downright insulting to compare him to the Flim Flam Brothers like they're even remotely in equal tiers.
but... gak
Please keep Bronystate classy and your behavior intact. :)
derpyface: thats really sad
What's happening?
^^^
Ah yes, the podcast that happened because VioletVanilla is absent
rainbowfan: you're welcome
You know what they say, once you go gak you never go back.
Did you see the Gak commerciall was run four time s in a row? Gahh!
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe, jokes on you I am extremely calm and collected
Wait, what's happeniung?
It's because everybody was forced to sit through the ads live
Thanks guys for the podcast and the game.
And only because of that
Even implying that slavery and capitalist scams are "equal", even indirectly, is rather insulting. >_>
0,14We gon' miss you guys ;________;
^^
Scoot-Scootaloo: <3
SaxyPretender: miss who?
goodbye Allegr0, GigabotHarmonie see you two later
BAI!
Bye.
bye :(
should i buy gak ? advertising really works...
Bye Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie ;~;
CrystalPhoenix: then why are you using your energy to type such things, it sounds like your mind is too simple
WHAT HAPPENED???
When does the episode discussion ban end again?
Gak is awful. :p
Allegr0: Have fun with all 235 of us ;_;
lol
No, I just dont think Sombra made a very good villain. I GET that he was a threat, I GET that was a evil dictator, but from what they showed during the present, not the flashback, he just wasnt very intimidating. When he first appeared, when we didnt see him, was he best part for me. I felt some fear, because I didnt know what he looked liked, what he could do, but then all he did was wait around for a magic wall to come down
gak or floam?
Well, who knew that my first show would be my last...?
derpyface: it didnt look very healthy
they both taste bad
lol
i once saw a diary of a wimpy kid commercial 6 times in a row...was horrible
bye, Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie. Take care and don't forget us. :)
yo Swag SHUT UP
Good luck Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie :)
If they're still using the old formula, then it's a carpet stainer, too
:'( DONT LEAVE UUUUUUUUUUS
...
I'll miss you until i start listening to Celestia tomorrow
*cries for some reason
you know
Good luck Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie
I'd appreciate if GigabotHarmonie said my name, just so I know how his T2S pronounces it.
fine fine fine Illshut up
OH SHT IM AT THE GS
Someone answer me...:'(
AJ is pretty awesome
this is just shit
Allegr0: Will that mean no more random music/video streams? Will you only do them on Celestia Radio?
[SWAG]Haku: when people have different opinions, its theirs not yours
GAK`: oh no, not you, DONT RESTART IT :[
Haku: I get that he's not a well written villain. That's entirely different from claiming he's less "scary" than the Flim Flam Brothers.
everything
dak fak sak
Or that he's "less evil" than they are.
The latter is decidedly boneheaded.
I never said he was less evil!
(\
He'
oh I've seen that before
Who dosen't like gundam every once in a while?
He'll eventually get to T
Forget it!
I can't find the pinkie face trick
Nyeh
lol
aw yeah.
He's not a bad villain, he's just a cliche villain.
IM WAITING!!!
(\
All these names are so cool
I need a handle
Sombre was more of a force of nature, like the Windigo.
that xyzzy game is back online
Jmo: coming from a chav Australian?
"I'm evil because of evil"
OH SHT I CAN SEE MYSELF
But I've never been here before
Ohhhhhhh
I just joined today and i got attached to them a bit
OHHHHHHHHH
I love the mute button for ppl
ALMOST THERE
so many derps
Is relatively cliche, but doesn't always mean it's bad.
He wasnt a cliche villain, they just didnt show enough of him to make him into a great villain
Allegr0: GigabotHarmonie thanks for saying my name :)
What's happening????
that's me!
ALMSOT MEH!
Come at me Jnomo
THATS ME
BACK
This is the first time I've seen this stream, and I'm already going to miss them
That was a fun card game BTW
King Smokey of Northrend wasn't a force of nature
crimson: yup
i was that crimson
THEY SAID MY NAME!!! *squee*
just some greedy asshat who wanted power
funkballs..
Who is leaving?????? :[
IM BACK...YOU CAN SAY MY NAME...i was offline for a bit...
Allegro and Gigabit
If Sombra makes a return later, and he gets more screen time, more lines, just more interaction with the ponies, then I will think of him as a greatv villain
they're moving to Celestia Radio
Lol :D bye guys :(
I GOT THE KLOBB
Kendraco:
No motivations outlined or anything, just evil. Which can be okay....except the episode was just poorly written in general.
:'(
So it still fell flat.
yay :P
How did you get sick in the first place GigabotHarmonie?
CriticKitten I think thats something we can agree on
YEAH!
My problem wasn't the villain, though, for once. It was the songs.
thanks guys im gonna miss you :'(
The songs were *pointless*.
emangamer: where are you?
Celestia Radio? Will they still do LiveStream?
CriticKitten, you want motivation? Desire for power, based on the flashback where he was dictatorship
CriticKitten: They aren't really memorable, as well.
the songs werent great, but they were ok
naturesfury: your always welocmed back here
:') My name. im happy.
/me Hugs Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie tightly
And I mean *pointless* as in "served absolutely no purpose and come out of nowhere"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRsAiFhCsE
/me joins in the group hug
Parappa The rapper!
[SWAG]Haku: the crystal ponies song was great
/me joins in
lmao
you guys are great ill be sure to check you guys out
Celestia Radio? Will they still do LiveStream?
Hai dat me
i think the songs were good, but they werent nearly as good assome of the songs of the past
my only problem with the songs I had was the lenght
So long Allegro and Gigabit...I love you guys :( may your endeavors bring you success :)
other than that I loved them
said my name :$ yay~
Most of the songs prior at least have the general purpose of building character or setting a mood, but....well, look at the "Test Song". It's like they tried to make something epic-feeling but it's just not.
(\ GAK 6_9
Get better GigabotHarmonie, I miss your voice
GIGA IS STILL HERE!?!?!?
I am Parappa The rapper and i say you've gotta belive!
I AM YOUR STALLION OF WAR
(\GAKFORALL/)
especially the reprise of the test song
CriticKitten Another thing we can agree on
It doesn't set the mood given that we already KNOW the mood before that point. We JUST saw the context of the "test", the song makes no sense!
(\ /)
It wasnt even really a test!
they're still saying names?
WHAT IS THE MUSIC aghh
The last time I'll get to hear them say my name
It was a "Save the World" thing
Oh yes, the "test" is just dumb.
Allegr0: <3
my name is an acronym ._.
You missed valoreins
GOODBYE ALL TIME TO DO SOMETHING ELSE!
Wub woo too GigabotHarmonie ;_;
wat
GigabotHarmonie: What about valoreins? :)
I think they were going for "self-sacrifice is more important than personal glory" but again, the context murders it.
"If you fail, Twilight, you get an F. And also the world ends, but dont worry about that"
Anyone realized that cards against humanity game is back on
so many names o.o
You too, Allegr0 ;_;
yay
GAK memes?
Is BronyState leaving?
:'(
EEYUP
I am Parappa The rapper and i say you've gotta belive!

Of course i will

So are they moving to Celestia Radio?
Good luck at Celestia Radio guiz

Granted, it's still not the worst thing ever or anything.
/me licks Domo :P
Domo stream O_O
im so confused right now? are we going to celestia radio instead or is this place gone for good?
Who jumped on?

Domo stream! :)
Ohai Wrek.

But it's downright soft compared to the season 2 finale, or the season 2 opening even.
wnhats the music
aghhh
/me holds a Domo stream!
so whos streaming now?
Bye!
isn't wrek still forbodden from streaming?
:'(
Domo?
Domo.
its Wrek Swag
this song ;_;
Buytoast: Yep.
WHATS THE SONG NAME D:
I remember this show
Has to be Domo due to the amount of pings
Buytoast - wait wat?
Buytoast: he is, its not him
just in time for a Domo stream yay :)
I need this song
WHO IS PINGING!?!?!?
In the Box ending theme
i know it's not him
so many pings
Buytoast: till the 18th

why is Wrek forbidden?
daw
Buytoast - what did he do?

Get better GigabotHarmonie
i think we need to keep saying the magical Word

something about porn
D'aaaww
D'aaaaww...

I am Parappa The rapper and i say you've gotta belive!
Haku: It sucks by comparison to the existing material, is what I mean.
now im all full of sad
ik
what about Wrek being forbidden?
I am going to miss Wrek's streams.
whats the new site?
*hug*
All dem Skype sounds
one more time
I'm going to guess Wrek is streaming?
lol
CriticKitten why of course
celestia radio
Nope
weeping_pegasi82: Domo.
wut?
if Wrek wanted this to repeat, he would put this on Youtuberepeat
BUFFER
The episode has plenty of individual problems but the biggest and most overarching is....it's just poorly written.
aw well
i remember this show
bufferrr
:'(
BUFF
/me threatens the buffer
CriticKitten Dude, I dont like agreeing with you. Stop making good points.
just because it's art and such doesn't make it wreck it wrek streamin
buffer
CriticKitten: Lauren needs to fire some writers, its slowly been a problem
:[
I will say I enjoyed the musical reprise at the very end
I was going to type this in a word doc, but I'll do it live.
:'(:'(:'(
wow this is lagging a lot
it received all my feels as a musician
I didn't see any problem in the storyline.
BUFFER
Poorly written even beyond Mare Do Well, really. The narrative falls flat on its face from moment one.
Kandarihu: U shore?
CriticKitten: well if its expanded, it could work good. but as a standalone premiere, its not very good, yes
buffer
CriticKitten Ok, I just dont like agreeing with people at all

GAK GAK
Oi, I liked the premier; it had Luna; Celestia and Twilight used Dark Magic
I will totaly check des guys out
twilight_sprinkle: Now see, that's what I'm HOPING will happen. I'd like to have Sombre be the main villain for the entire season, manipulating events and eventually be revealed in the finale.
crap
Gak is going to become one of those meme's where if ppl keep repeating it. It just gets tiring and no one will care in the future
SORRY
But I don't expect them to do that.
Going to become? Wrong verb tense there, Darkts3.
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: shhhhhh
anyone lagging?
