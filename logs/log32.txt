DVDBLURAYHD
better be worth my time that vid
hell.
I feel more confident every second about reading this
04Speaking of Snivy
RD > Fluttershy you know
4it only took nintendo *looks at watch* 10 years to make a sequel
04I gave him Growth and Leer :D
FAFHAAKLLSDSCSCVD
6Stopping the test for a bit after this...
Lol
combustiblelemons: RD is a funny abbreviation for Twilight Sparkle :3
04in teh flash that is
Applejack > All other ponies you know
whats your fav charater hooh54?
OH MY GOD HOW ANOYING
i would say but it belongs to EAD
Singing Giggle at the Ghosties and Winter Wrap Up is fun.
its inter...esting
04also bbl
Umm... PG stuff, of course. Like... coloring! We'd color together.
4Zazu :3
I love my snivy plush
well I don't mind twilight but Rainbow Dash is more fun to draw
4lUCKY
YEaaaaaaaaaaaah
on LCDTV
sure
04Snivy plush :D
and Caroline is Chell's mother
plus I can get her mane right 100% of the time.
ugh, I guess I'm gonna write another fanfic
7This might take a while, Hooh54. D:

o.O
because rainbow dash is the most awesome pony ever....who wouldnt want to draw her
4(i know i misspelled that :P)
8...i didnt understand that sentence

What happens when i break the sound barrier? THIS IN A MINOR SCALE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKRvjcr92i4&feature=player_detailpage#t=126s
I've never actually attempted drawing ponies.
4Tara Strong was Timmy Turner
and keria
Lemons, RD can't swim?

4I can't stop trying for a shiny
I read it. It was a good, short read. Great for people like me who don't normally read fics.
Ow
what was it about?
Good lord, my eyes
Pinkie's childhood trauma, her friends accepting her for who she is..
I looooooooove archen
Was I just kissed by mongoose?
Its so cute lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZH3SpBujwk
I almost shed a tear..
i had even cry,cry and cry when simba's dad died ded you cry hooh54?
yay ppl on dA are favoriting my derpy pic
4How did it go?
apparently so, Lemons
lol
8cant tell
glad you guys like my pic though
Ewww gay.
and i hate scar
8i definitely got cardigan brony though
4No, but it makes me sad : (
I think most people cried at that the first time lol
21374y
I need to practise drawing Twi though.
Yes you were lemons
*practice
4And to Roara, I wish it had merchindiseeee D :
And You liked it
384295
My computer is acting funny
Free, are you having typing troubles?
/me had simba PJ's when he was 7 :D
Can never tell if it was practise or practice thanks cog :S
np
Snivy?
Oh wait no archen
Yeh same
I want to make a plush of it, but other pushes have priority
what other plushes
i hate scar and his heyenas
4Except for this custom push
guyz i have 2 go soon
I may make a sculpture of it
WHAT OTHER PLUSHES D:
hey roara would you do plush commissions?
....lol hi mistress
/me does a silly dance
hi Mami
:D
Nick, dunno, they take tons of time-
03why did I misread that as hot mami
LOL
4I dream to one day sew myself a giant Ho-Oh
/me is bored*
Hmm... how can we help?
lemons
yes?
you got the back legs bad.
thanks, SillyNilly :)
It is written...
Yup, np. Good read!
lol fuzz knows that
which evil lion you hate hooh45?
cool though.
yeah I can never draw back legs right flame
It's cute still though.
it's fine, Rainbow
Gah, there
I think the artist was just being sensitive for saying "Badass"
hello all, i'm new :)
I didn't like the female evil lion from LK2
was it scar's wife?
on dA do ihave to put a mature content warning though i made it btw
Hi Rising
Hi Rising
>.>
hey rising
oh you did?
cool
zira
yup
hi there, Rising, welcome!
i think he only saw bad and thought D: my drawing sucks
thanks
4Nuka
zira?
hellloow
heya, Mere
wha
4Nope
Lots of people, not a lot of talking
sup Lurker
nnnope
actually, it's been pretty busy in here
sort of busy
nick is it zira you hate?
mmm, I'd like to research some doritos
With your mouth!
hah!
...
ohjes :9
I'm good at creating oncomfortable silences with my mere presence (see what I did thar?)
i c wat u did thar
what you did there, i do in fact see it
*uncomfortable
a name pun worthy of myself! I applaud you
but everyones a mere lurker here
I am everyone
Especially you, Ali
not hate, just don't like
and now i go a lurking *burrows*
/me lurks
and off he goes into the dark recesses of EqD
lurkers... they only arise when the lights are off and the time is right...
Disney had her trying to fill scar's shoes and it didn't really work, it probably better off being a total new villain
-
...
and when the mods are asleep
i belive you are confusing lurkers with grues
or when they are the mods

^ random space
The evil enchantress jazz is pretty banging
SPAAACE
it is

Mere, I'm still kind of trying to get over that Finn who changed his name to Rainbow Dash
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nv8gZ8jGAA&feature=channel_video_title
hahahaha
that's exciting
03I made it for a reason
03for people who can't instlal stuff
03*install
has he posted proof yet?
Yeah I heard that
Cog
yes?
I'm yet to see it
13That takes effort
13xD
that's win.
03not really
If he has, I will hug him
5Portable mIRC? Hm?
03you just download the fiel
03*fil,e
SONIC F EPISODE 6 IS OUT YEAH
03it's actually a lot easier than logging into mibbit
03yeah
Maybe he should hang out with Optimus Prime
so has he posted proof?
lol
03the only downside is it doesn't work on Windows 7
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrjhsBnXYU4&feature=related
lol imagine being pulled over and asked to show your liscence
03I'm going to make an updated one some day
:P
i would have played this in the GGG
5FFFFFFF
hi my name's rainbow dash *shows liscence* problem officer?
5I HAVE WINDOWS 7
5THAT DOES ME NO GOOD DRF. :C
officer: "....*derp*"
4ME TOO
trollface.jpg
lol
If that officer was secretly a brony it'd be a win...maybe
if not, he's doomed
^yes
man: WHY WUB WOO
rite he`ll give himself a ticket
5Oh that reminds me that I still need to get IRC for Android.. the app or whatever
7Hooh54, is there any way of having a 6 v 6 battle with Flat Rules?
03Android IRC
he should have RD as a picture
03it's not free but it's worth it
5Is it pretty easily found in the Market?
4I don't think so
with the why wub woo face
5OH so it's NOT free. :C
XD
haha
5Well then I'm not gonna get it lol.
lol
mine was i just can't wat to be king in the lion king and love will find away in the lion king2
I got a scoop
/me 4is back!!!
03there's a free version
a scoop?
5O:
5Donde?
Sethisto finally learned to make picture links
03just search for Android IRC
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPF_9nxJZkc&feature=relmfu
/)^3^(\
4lol
But did it wrong the first time
*applauds*
Lurker, did you covered wars?
switched the pics
Its what I'm on right now
4Rolplay4life, I didn't know you spoke italian
Wut?
Seth. I still hate you ಠ_ಠ
i got lagged
the scoop reminds me of Dead Rising 1
4uh, forgot the "e"
what did he do?
03yeah Aurora what happened to your computer LOL
03hm
Why do you hate Seth, Lemons?
oh
I'm at my moms
03apparently there's no longer the free version
Gah alright
03you have a laptop, that's no excuse
I don't have wireless internet
I wrote a bad fic. My fault yes.
5xD I was too lazy to put on the accent.
03use EasyTether
03for your phone
hi there, Free
And my desktop is currently unusable
The response wasn't exactly friendly though :/
That's what's its called?
This is _______!!
03it turns your phone's Internet into an internet connection
03yeah
4which is better? fusion bolt or bolt strike?
5And the other upside-down question mark blah.
patrick!
03that's not free either but I can give you the apk
That's what i'm counting oooooooon
what'd he say, Lemons?
now i only want you goooooooooone
Cool
don't feel bad, man, my first attempt got rejected too
hooh54 whats your fav song
now i only want you gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooone.
too short
so, may i ask a small fanfic related question?
he said my fic was like rainbow dash and gilda on crack
and i quote
So that's good
lmfao
4What song?
and thats when rainbow dash became rainbow crash
03hm
"Self insert and gary stu as FUCK. I'm not even kidding"
Cool, I didn't know Seth actually denied stories
I feel better already
not a terrible response, but neither is it constructive
yeah, I wrote a story before and he denied it
that's what beta readers are for
i'm worried he'll deny mine :(
Because apparently I'm a communist ._.
in the lion king
this is why I post all my shit on ponychan first for feedback
< dying of anxiety, haha
guyz i gotta go
Bye!
Try DA, you can test your story in a safe environment
jbye!
03stupid iTunes, work already
bye :(
4Be Prepared and Exile
yeah probably a good idea
im sticking to drawing for a while though
4From both movies, of course
join Pony-Tales group, people there aren't trying to be harsh
Gary Stu OC ponies make me gag
well, i have to go, did you guys want to take a look at the story?
in general
eeeeyup, Night
i had a fied trip today at school
Oh, a story?
Only had 1 OC character
Well, shoot if you'd like
mine has one as well
my OC character is me
But this is more something for EQ study
Hello?
but I don't overpower myself in anyway or anthing
Hello!
also word of advice from the lab boys (sethistio) he does NOT accept stories about communism.
ohhay
hehe
gnight everypony!
g'night!
goonight!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSzv7qylfEoN2c3TwWSlGSOKMhec1P-6hKvenXD22jk/edit?authkey=CMOZpvAG&hl=en_GB
wait, wut Lemons?
hope you enjoy, pleasure meeting you all
4i'm gonna do a Random Match
see ya
Bye!
But...COmmunism is magic!
my story was called "fall of stalliongrad"
what's this Pony-Tales someone mentioned?
What about National Socialism?
Do you think equestria is a communist nation?
It's a group on DA
I'd say he denies that too
ahh
its a monarchy duh.
at the nypa
That focuses specifically on fanfics
everyone has a job and they all conrol everything
EVERYTHING
monarchy/democracy?
I had a People's Republic of Equestria in one of my Vicky 2 games =P
Night, National Socialism is a different system
I don't post there, unfortunately
It might be aTheocracy
the weather, the seasons, etcx
since Celestia is pretty much God
lol
:l
Well, they revere her as royalty more than they do as a religious leader
yeah, but she can lift the freaking sun
SO MUCH FLUTTERDASH
government by a god is a lot different from government by religious establishment
exile?
flutterdash is the best ship.
/me sighs* It's not communism, it's called "United Order"
but I won't discuss that
lol
4anyone wanna battle? :P
True, but that doesn't appear to be a religious function
03oh, Aurora, have you heard of Firefox Aurora? XD
or if it is, religion isn't that big in Equestria
There isn't much to work on, so far as reverance.
*facehoof*
I mean, they have like, no problems, so there isn't much impetus =P
do you mean my lullby?
It's a different kind of theocracy when you can actually see god... and send her friendship reports
I wondrr if they have a church of celestia or something
No LOL
4Quan?
No problems at lest in Ponyville.
03it's something about beta versions
no, they just have Celestia being there in person
She might be something like a Roman God
I mean, people worshiped Caesar
03anyway, I'm gonna upload EasyTether in a sec
no need for a "church" when they can just go see her in person
but he wasn't a "God"
Yeah exactly
I wonder if Celestia just lies about being able to control the sun.
03but do you have a USB cable for the phone with you?
K
No
Lol
03well you need one :/
We have history of Gods on earth being worshipped directly
So probably a Roman model
03the only way to do it over wifi is to have your phone rooted
exactly, Workin
Might as well wait til the weekend
As a physics majro, I believe she's lying through her teeth >.>
Applejack's flashback to Manehattan, the ponies there seemed pretty grump.
03well then I'll wait, remind me
yep k
city people are like that though
Yeh but that doesn't imply a lack of an organized worship structure E.G. a church
well not in britain
Could've just been blowing it out of proportion on purpous.
Think about this too, the fact that there are huge buildings in Manehattan imply a huge industrial society.
but in NYC yes.
So are there pony socialists?
my point, Workin is that you don't NEED an "organized church" when your everday life IS that same exact function
hooh54 do mean my lullby
I find the weirdest thing in the MLP universe horse drawn trains
yes, that IS an oddity, Lemons
03oh
03look at that
I mean what the hell they've got the steam engine to pull it along
4Oh, did you ask her or something?
but if you know your history, they didn't call it the "iron horse" for nothin'
03I already have EasyTether uploaded LOL
why are horses pulling it?
03since someone else wanted it
5I feel very distracted today. :|
Maybe they don't know how to use a steam engine?
or they don't have coal?
Maybe the engine is more of a generator to power the electricity in the cabins
who was the enginer derpy?
5And kind of lolrandom.
Possible.
maybe adding the extra horse-power increases speed?
03I uploaded it so you can get it for free :P
Do they even have electricity?
8he/she told me in a thread
well they have lightswitches
and lights
7Yes, Hooh54? *late*
It seems really variable.
and cameras
Eh I dunno Cog
4Ah
03http://goo.gl/wdvus
yes my point exactly
03just go to that from the browser on your phone
Like it's extant, but not particularly common.
5Hm, not right now. I don't really need it, but thanks for the offer...
so it's like 1900 in equestria
Yeah. My idea is that it's 20's era technology, but cultural and artistic advancements are very progressed
03eh
03I guess I'll delete it then
4I wonder why they don't just delete it? Nothing was really lost and everyone remembers what happened.
yes
I doubt that there's anything like an actual power grid in Ponyville.
Steampunk?
03because I don't want the people who make it to yell at me for pirating it
eh, kinda
a church system helps to regulate worship and all that so you don't have one guy doing quiet prayer and another doing bull sacrifices
steampunk is more 1880's and such though
guys, you're all forgetting 2 very important things:
1. Magic
they could use water power for electricity if they have no fuel
I guess Dieselpunk would be the closest analogue
I'm probably elaborating this badly, I'm VERY damn tired
2. IT"S A SHOW
Larger cities might have them, but Ponyville's electricity is likely based around personal generators.
lol
Yeah but it's our job as the fans to overanalyze everything
dude, have a nap or something
A-doy
5It didn't work anyways. xD
I can't
But exercising our critical thinking is FUN! ;D
I'm kicking my sleep schedule into line
exactly ^_^
Cog: but...but...I can't NOT overthink this stuff!
yeh, yeh, I know Workin
So I have to stay up a liiiitle longer
ahh
do you know what nypa means?
Also, Magic is just energy manipulation ;)
If you're wondering how heavy Applejack is, and other science facts, keep telling yourself it's just a show and you should really just relax
MAGIC POWERED TRAINS?
Everything is energy manipulation when it comes down to it.
why not use magic instead?
you'd save having to pay workers!
Maybe the magic is powered by Friendship
what was that lyric to the theme song of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000"?..."If you're wondering how he eats and breaths, and other science facts, just repeat to yourself 'it's just a show! I should really just relax'..."
Energy manipulation and magnets.
:P
MST3K mantra ftw
Magnets power the world
8well, he/she said they are probably going to move it to a secret board that only mods can see in case they need it in the future
4Quan, can we battle now?
its funny because they actually do
exactly.
4So do the mods have their very own archive for super special threads or something?
Like, what if Friendship literally provides magical energy to equestria, and that's why everypony is so friendly. Because their damn lives depend on it
hmm!
Everything you perceive as solid is actually just the repulsion of like magnetic fields
How do they hold tools in their hooves? MAGNETS.
4It's a rhetorical question, yeah, but I do wonder...
If you van't explain anything, MAGNETS is the answerr.
Or, they have gecko feet ;)
If there were any meme I don't get, it's the whole "ask a Mormon about magnets, it's funny"
can't*
4(creating random topic) Quany is 22 posts late
Their hooves, being made of special keratin like their horns, are faintly magical!
4for some reason, my pokemon can't participate in Random Matches
7Almost, Hooh54.
Their hooves are made of iron and their tools are magnetic?
why is noone taking to disney?
or they wear horseshoes
4i thought it was because Smeargle knew Sky Drop
4but it's not that
ouch ._.
magnetic horseshoes
7If it's a forced conversation, perhaps we're not interested.
I don't think horseshoes are nailed on in Equestria
but they no doubt have them
Earth and Pegasus ponies do have innate magic to them.
my head hurts
(not that we the viewers can see, anyways)
8well, i think they put the scam thread there for legal reasons
Hooves are pretty much fingernails so I don't think it would really hurt
Such as Pegasi walking on clouds.
Its already 4 ufh
That counts.
they need to make a chat room for this^^
Shoing horses never hurts
5OH DRF, now I see. ^^;
it shure does
8i dunno, maybe they need it in case stuff like this happens in the future
Hell, we could probably state that pegasi magic manifests as something not unlike a mass effect field.
EQS?
03it's almost 7 here
if you hurt a horse nailing on a shoe you're a fuckup
03and I have a night class I need to go to :/
:з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
XD Suddenly, geth.
All ponies have magic inside of them (Hence the whole "cutie-mark" thing) but only unicorns can push that magic outside of their bodies
4let's watch a disney channel movie~
03LetS not.
4i kinda miss hearing that
They probably have tactile telekenesis (or, magic)
If you don't get the internet's obsession with magnets I'll show you the source.
fuckin magnets, how do they work?
has anyone made a Pokemon-Ponies image cross? I want to see "A Wild Rainbow Dash has appeared!"
03fuckduck
4i'm gonna bo crazy! what's wrong with my Battle Box?
Pegasi magic manifests as an ability to reduce their own mass and inertia.
Lemons, it's just the whole "Ask a Mormon about it!" thing that I don't get
Yes,
7Are your pokemon hacked, Chao?
Looks like Rising's gone?
Yes they have.
jerkcircle
Also, space.

Rozon, http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/pokemon/1

See the thing is, if Celestia and Luna really do move the sun and moon, there is no space in Equestria >.>
lol`d
Mormons and magnets huh weaver
I have to see Life's manager about how these fucking magnets work.
^
Just throw CL at him
Some fics have the sun and moon being enormous contstructs.
4[Your] Zoroark, [your] Hydreigon, Cofagrigus, Oshawott (Chao VI), Smeargle and Toxicroak
well i think it's either they have no explanation for them due to their beliefs
or it's just some trolling way of saying don't take me seriously
like "I own a horse"
7Don't see anything wrong...
Hasa Diga eebowai
7Items?
4Smeargle knew Sky Drop but i replaced it
i own a horse!
Chzo Mythos!
seriously
4oh hold up
7Connecting to wi-fi, Hooh54.
I dunno, had to bring that up too.
suggesting multiple weird shit things, ranging from dyson sphere to a rogue planetoid terraformed into a functional biosphere
4Hmm
wait...how would Mormons not have an explanation for magnets due to their beliefs?
Does that mean ICP are Mormons?
I wish I did, I'd name it rainbow dash and enter it into the grand nationals
yeah I'd say the second option cog
mmk
eeyup
ICP?
Ohh . . Dyson Sphere. But wouldn't you be able to see the other side from the ground? . . . unless there was a smaller sky-sphere INSIDE the Dyson sphere . . . *head hurts*

Hey
Hey, hey, hey!

Flaskgarg is still banned?

Hm? Why?
D&D ._.
Sorry I stay away from that lightning
It's not like I'm actually using D&D stats or anything.
D&D?>
Spam, Porn , Making Mods Angry, Ect.

7Still a-waiting, Hooh54. :P Would like to check on your response.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg1OiFSsRJk
I'm gonna start writing that fanfic. Maybe on Booklyn or something.

4It keeps on glitching when I talk to you
GL LQ!

To hay with cookies, I'll join the dark side for the ponies!
MPR

A cheerilee plushie needs to exist.

Cheerielee is the greatest background pony.
AWDOWABLE, AWESOME PLOOSHIES
Okay, thanks for the tip.

You react to Trixie, but not to ME?

Lemons hates Both CMC and Metal gear....

he is the worst person ever.
watch it...
02(@Quan)
I like metal gear
4Triple Battles are confusing
I don't like metal gear acid.
6I wish I had a way to check my post history...
7I'm very oriented toward singles.
/me grabs combustiblelemons and locks him in a basement
Acid does suck
that specific game is terrible.

/me flies away to the moon
THATS WHAT SHE SAID
I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn't take like a small break from ponies.
i got sucked into SC2 like that, so dissapointing
Alright, I've decided. I'm not releasing the prequel before the actual story.
6I know I had a 5555 GET at one point.
._. you missed a key piece of information lightning to my previous comment
6I need proof of it though so I can have all quads.
?
6And that would keep me in rank 2.
4you've already said that disney -_-
oh good
Alright anyone under the age of 13 must leave

Oh, you wanted it to be much more of a challenge?
yes
4I don't care about tiers

4but it's not
Look here, are 3 little poniesReady to sing for this crowd
Are you picking up what I'm throwing down?
first priority is RD's "so awesome" face.
12why do bugs always go in awkward places were you can't reach them to catch them and then let them outside
Listen up, cause heres are storyI'm gonna sing it VERY LOUD!!
yes
is the round robin still screwed up badly or back to somewhat normal
12annoying bugs.
8can you screencap the google page?
or why wub woo face fuzz
4like how Volcarona and Genesect can use fly but aren't flying types
4they're the only bugs to fly btw
Tango Sucka?
*twitch twitch*
i have a fav pokemon and thats lugia
here's our story

yes
can people see my awesome purple text?

I can't decide upon a favorite to be honest
nope.avi nafe
/me 4doesn;t know :P
Sorry Nafe, it doesn't show up purple for me :(
4My fave is obvious
8hey starpony

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4oh i know i know

Did you check the 'activate foreground color' box?
i like the wings and the tail
6I can't see the actual GET, Hipster.
I have raised those since... well you could raise them

who likes mew&mewtwo
Nanyan Tsute...
/me pokes the color settings.
hey guys, i'm back
4cause you're not normal?
and in pretty much every single second generation and up game I have played
4just kidding
6basically.
4Lol
except for the Orange hack
/me feels sad
ohai rising.
mew is cute
Maybe color's disabled for this channel *shrug*
4Probably the biggest Ho-Oh fan on here
7Back.
Could be.
NAFEDUDE, the channel is set to +S mode. Color is stripped for users.
4Hi :3
12LOL why do I find it amusing that my idiot friend used to hoover bugs
At least you can see your own color.
7Meep.
ya
7My favorite pokemon, to add to those above, is Ninetales.
4i might lose
there's solour in this? :D
4!chatstats
colour*
Chat stats updating.
4heatran vs Hydreigon
yes but only you can see it
4oooh
4Hydreigon
7Does Heatran have a Balloon? Does Hydreigon have Surf?
Exactly!
hooh54 you like mew or mewtwo?
8Hasbro confirmed they are working on an MLP DVD
hey, what dus the % and @ mean?
nice
4MEWTHREE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Half-op and full-op, respectively.
4lol
4no
op?
4Mew
4hyper voice
hi
Channel bosses, basically.
T_T nafe...
operator
overpowered!
4draco meteor
basically admin/mod
OH
4Reshiram or Zekrom
4dark pulse
oh, nice
4ice fang
4KYUREM!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey, if I ask to have my story put up (Prequel and Chapter 1), do I have to get 4000 words still, since the beginning is labeled as a chapter?
Sup, I'm here to derail the thread into something to do with videogames...
7Weeeeeeell, Reshiram hits everything for at least neutral damage...
So watcha doin'?
Vidyagames.
And hello to you, too.
who got a 14 inch lugia
how does one earn op status?
7But I have an Adamant Zekrom. :P
vidjagames
4Not me XD
why are little kids on forums so annoying
By not asking for it, mostly.
Makin' em.
4Modest Reshiram her
4it took 5 generations for a fire-type to not be weak to water :P
Typing up a fanfic. Why?
4*here
Haha, it's a fact of nature that they usually are
lemme see if I can get this right...
4Whoa
4You serious?
If you ask, you don't get.
4Link plox
Usually the channel owner(s) will ask you to be an op, not the other way around
makes sense
I feel like I work at kindercare
http://www.owlpages.info/fantasy/viewtopic.php?t=5706
6lol I found a way to access all the cached GET threads.
makes sense
7o3o
What would be a good Pony Vidya Game?
i wont 14 inch lugia
That doesn't suck
i'd like to see an RTS
luna game!
lol
And I mean a full blown game, not just a flash spin-off fan game
I've seen pretty much one channel ever of appreciable size where almost everyone was an op
4Chao?
My Little Pony: Interactivity is Magic
It actually worked pretty well
4Hipster, where are you seeing this information?
4what's true??
Fighting game.
NAFEDUDE: :D
actually fire not being weak against water defies physics and all logic that has existed in the world since said thing was first harnessed by humans
4Heatran
/me 4tilts its head in confusion
7Nope.
4what
7Heatran takes 2x damage, amazingly.
4too many words
a Rainbow Dash the pegasus game
:D
what is this and why does it exist?
4Really?
I'd like a 3D MMORPG where you're explorers/colonists sent to resettle a newly rediscovered continent . .
exactly
4oh, yo mean Reshiram?
like sonic the hedgehog
I think a game similar to heavy rain, in terms of gameplay, would work
it exists because kids are stupid
Not story
4it's the first fire-type to not be super-effective vs ater
idk, i think an RTS could work well
retro games work well
8ghosties: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/mlp-dvd-possibly-in-works.html
4*water
because kids are stupid
Except that you don't have to hold down a shoulder button to move
4because of dragoness
I'd only want to PvE, not PvP :/
What I mean is that most of the game would be context sensitive.
Call of Duty: Black Clops.
Ponyville RPG
just sayin'
RTS? Real Time Strategy right?
yeo
yessir
yep*
Ponyville is too limited. I'd want to get out and explore more.
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
A command and conquer RTS
A mix between Telltale point & click and context-based games like Heavy rain. I think that would work really well
02I hate my interneeeet~
4yay
it could work, if done right
Zerbranky: lol
4who wants to see how i beat someone!!!!!
4I DO!!!!!!!
MLP Roleplay and could use the same customization that All Point Bulletin: Reloaded use
I can't really imagine a really good pony game, because combat would be a major problem.
7Please tell.
how do i bold peoples names only?
yeah, it is
4Wow
It'd have to be not-combat-centered
4really?
4We were just talking about this last night lol
So, like I said. Heavy rain
a building sim could be cool
I'm not sure, Nafe
7Maybe.
4I'd probably get it IF there were extra goodies on there
I'm gonna make sprites for MLP:FiM Earthbound editoin.
4in my profile - lol - a Yamask is next to meh
*edition
It also, depends on what species you are
4Especially if they include the alternate eps of Cutie Mark Chronicles
4what's that mean
Anything with fists could work.
8i would get it, but i would have to figure out where to hide it
/me 7is still irritated at a lack of equalized levels 6 v 6 on B/W wi-fi. :|
Unicorns work well with RPG
who thinks who will win shadow lugia or lugia
Eventually, all I've got so far is some crappy sprites I spent like, an hour on.
Pegasi work well with racing, flying or adventure
4my battle box is 100% lv 100
Hey, why is MLP:FiM hyperlinked?
So, I don't think I could possibly go through with this fanfic; in the prequel alone I've added so many characters no one's even heard about. So, I'm trashing it.
4shadow lugia
7Lol.
4Ho-Oh used Thunder
listening Winter Wrap Up while watching Assassin's Creed Revelations gameplay...
/me 4runs
makes as much sense as a cow eating a cow.
4no wait: SHADOW HO-OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10Neither, because they're the same
that kinda sucks lightning
4If only Lugia was water/flying......
4hi hi Sky
7My battle box fluctuates in levels.
super ponybeat ftw
winter wrap up winter wrap up~
4Hello :3
10Hi Chao
/me 4quotes Bloomacncheez
7My lowest is currently 32 and my highest is 94.
I keep saying it, but Telltale games should make an MLP game. I think it would really work.
4You should see my competitive team
7I expect it to be equalized in battles...
Sucks, dunnit?
heh pony sprites ftw
4you mean
4For Pokemon Black
13Well, goodnight all :3
7See ya, AE>
4 32 go to 50
4Night!
7.*
10Bye Espy
I need to try again, but am too lazeh.
4night night
4late
they need to be 20% bigger
4i
4faill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not so bad, but they do need some work
Telltale games? like Sam & Max? and Strong Bad
I'm scrapping that.
Yeah
4i think i'm spamming now o.O
Gonna try again.
10Sorta
I think they could pull it off.
o_o
10o.o
8im seriously considering starting a new facebook profile so i can like the MLP stuff without my IRL friends seeing it
Assuming they worked with the original show creators
4lol, sorry, not my intention
whats the game going to be then revolver?
hooh54 do you think shadow lugia or lugia
ohai Skylands
That was like, a month or so ago.
10No worries
4Neither
4They're the same as sky said
10heya
4Don't worry~ Be happy~
10:P
nafedude left us
the sounds of the monotony wheel
4i have a question, for Hooh54 and disney
click click clock cuck click
hahaha
derp
A game wouldn't really work outside of Context-sensitive genres
4YeS?
*An MLP
4how long have you beens here?
/me 7hmms.
IT'S WEIRD LIKE EVERY FEW MINUTES IT'LL SOUND DIFFERENT even though it's actually not
7How bulky is Gliscor compared to Cofagrigus?
I'm talking modern day standards btw
it becomes background noise eventually too
i mat whos going to win hooh54
4About a weak
haha, yeah
4lol?
and netsplit?
idk, building sim could work
Flash games can do whatever they want and make it work
4Speaking of social networking, I'll probably be the one to start the Twitter page for BMN if we ever decide to expand
4*week
7week*?
yes^
7Lulz.
4cool
10I guess
although, it may just be that i really want a building sim at the moment :P
adventure game could be fun . . but you'd kinda by limited by class . . err race
Skylands ;3
4i've been here like 3 years, though i left for a year so that's like............um
8that would be a good idea, do you already use it?
Rising, go play in Bronyville in Second Life :D
4 3-1=OVER9000!!!
7I'm a veteran. :P
8actually
4 2 years i guess
8you know what?
10HML?~
second life?
8we should really start one
or on the pony Minecraft servers :)
How are you :>
But for a full blown title on something like Wiiware or PC games, only contxt-based games would work, aside from maybe racing..
10Decent
I tried mylittleminecraft
4I do use twitter, but I haven't been on there in a while
8it will make it so we can get info out to people faster
4wow, you don't read that word often
It was alright for a while i guess...
I think he means Simcity
context based?
Not mienkraft
<Drake> I'm angry.
03bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ooh simcity but with ponies :D
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 8Ludicolo.
I loved sim city.
4i say that to everyone
4But we were discussing twitter, facebook, and the like. I think silver mentioned something about a BMN facebook already
Yeah, like Heavy Rain or SBCG4AP
4loooool
4!pokemon
there's a Pony Fortress mod too . .
Hooh54, you are a 10Deoxys.

oh so split path kinda game right?
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 9Gorebyss.
"advisor applejack" we need more apple orchards to feed all the ponies!
No NAFEDUDE
10Suddenly scriptspam everywhere
10Oh

They have like
Alpha Ponetauri?
4double lol
ONE THOUSAD ORCHARDS
my stomach hurrttsss
4!shipping
4 Hooh54 is paired with Cube
What I mean is that you aren't given the same powers throughout a game.
What's wrong, Psychic?
4does !fight still exist?
Everything is only in that moment
nah, only one, really, it's just enormous
4Companion Cube
i think ponyville apple trees could save world hunger!
7Replace 'everywhere' with Hooh54 and perhaps.
IVAN HOW U DO THAT
10lol
Do waht?
4like first time, EVER!!!
4Lol
7Offense possibly intended.
10Light!
a switch between characters game would work ivan

Bold only my name
yeah
10Only I call LL Light :P
4hi hi LL and Umbreon
I bolded your name?
4UMBREON!!!!!!!
Sky...*faints*
And now for something eduucative today: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7l3pbFiyQY

so you could play as applejack for kicking down drawbridges for example
I think thats part of the chat
10Faint? Why? o.o
7Dramatic.
It's an autoreaction to your full name being typed by someone else.
lost ponies?
busy day .-.
You mean like Sonic Heroes?
4Umbreon, you will replace the Umbreon i never got through GL
the DM was at work

10DM?
hey Ivan
I never played it ivan
and im not following you on your genre discription
District Manager
4Dancing Mummy
OH CRAP I REMEMBERED I HAVE TO FINISH MY DRAWING.
10Ah
Okay hold on lemme think
I played Sonic Heroes, cool game.
almost like a superintendant
but ive played games like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban
it worked really well in that.
all midnightwave is doing is pissing off the members
An Adventure game like Mario, you get to jump, have powerups and all this stuff.
terra keeps saying to stop calling her "granny" but she keeps doing it
on pokemon master quest lugia had a young lugia
It's constant through all the levels
10^ Derp
except HE can kick students out for poor performance
ok
and is veary cute
but you can switch characters
i'm sytarting to like the idea of lost vikings, but ponies
I ate too much for dinner
I feel terrible
and you have to get all of them across obstacles
Context-based means certain things only happen in certain situations
/me 4is curious
in order to win
4!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
Most games have a context button
Or action button
4!or something like that
yes combustiblelemons that is exactly what i mean
that'll be difficult to program though
conkers bad fur day
Like for opening doors or picking up stuff.
http://republibot.com/content/confound-these-ponies < new pony article/review
good luck though
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7l3pbFiyQY
Heavy Rain takes that to a whole new level, where almost EVERY button is context sensitive
So, it's a context-based game.
4hey, i just remembered. does Feather still come here often? i haven't seen her since......last year methinks
7Yes.
so who wants to talke to me & be my friend
That's the main aspect I'm talking about.
4lol
4that sounds kinda....................lonely
4or demanding i still can't tell
Heavy Rain also features other things like a split storyline with multiple endings, but that's not what I am refering to.
10Probably both
So yeah, like Conker's Bad Fur Day
I am currently playing heavy rain
Right now.
Right this second?
4well
yeah
4i can talk with yuu
good game
I liked that game.
Ponigami killer.
Wat.
So, yeah an MLP game with similar gameplay elements to Heavy Rain would work
I am the part where you play as the girl in the aparment
4as long as....um................as loooong aaaas.................i got nothing
Obvious Quit is Obvious
when She wakes up in the middle of the night.
hey who likes articuno's art i do
The story would be COMPLETELY different, but gameplay could be very similar
Have you tried the Adventures in Ponyville game on the Hub?
maybe more simplified movement.
10Moi
4i went to La Ronde yesterday, a Quebecan version of six flags
4i haven't really seen her art
Mongoose
No, I hate official cartoon flash games
7Dah, it's not nighttime yet in my game.
Or at least I usually do
/me 7wants to evolve her Gligar.
i think she will probably die
What?
just sayin'
4but what i have seen is nice
It wasn't too bad.
4lol Quany
that articles pretty good
4how impatient of thou
read it all, yay for positive reviews :D
4btw, do you need anything?
It's actually a small but unnoticable twist at that part
it managed to not insult us, i approve
7Hey, I also have to study for finals. :P
You'll see
7I'd like a Light Ball and Soul Dew, if that's what you mean?
How long has Equestria Daily been running?
Let's put it this way, she both does and doesn't die
4drat, my math final is tomorrow, three hours of fractions and additions and all that math stuff
i'd say since december 2010
you can if are on the sky temple of lugia and articuno
but thats a guess
EQD is as odl as the world is young
What story were you talking about? I just got on...
4i'll die if +'s and -'s are in that test
Hello.
Man, now I really want a Heavy Rain-styled Pony game.
NOT STORYWISE
Pony Rain, kay...
NOT. STORY. WISE.
dat nerdy kid
4Light Ball and Soul Dew? what pokemon would you like. or just random
what?
Gameplay wise only
6Hey Silver
like ur name
i like sayin dat
11How ya doing, Sprinkles?
7Give me a Celebi that's less than level 50.
In Team Fortress 2 it's great.
6Got all the stuff.
DAT WORD
I think EQ started January 19.
7And hmm...
"Pnesa killed That Nerdy Kid
11Awesome.
8hi silver
7Jirachi? o3o
derp
"
11Hey, Hipster.
4lol
Or at least, that's the oldest post I could find.
4a second of patience
I was off by a month
Wow.
meh.
<Ivan2294> NOT. STORY. WISE.
inb4cmcdeath
That's a lot of views.
-_-
yeah
mmhm
7Even better if you can alter those pokemons' natures.
that's alot of bronies
11So, I managed to put Brony Movie Night to good use for me. :D
we're gwn need a bigga server
It only counts my visits.
i was there when it hit 10000000 :P
theres about 200,000 bronies at the moment if i were to guess
6lol wut?
Me too
growing rapidly though
i was there when it hit... id on't know three mill?
FOUR DAYS from 10 to 11 mil
same lawrence
11Though...of course...I changed it to Friday Movie Nights, 'cause I'm a sissy like that. XD
Remember kids
I was there when it hit 500,000
DAT PLOT
still dot know the password or username:(?
8nice
the danger can always be ZOMBIES.
whose plot?
Look at it this way. Take the gameplay from Heavy Rain, simplify it ALOT, put it in a mixed art-style between 3D and the shows style, and make a game out of that.
7disney, did you make an account?
thats tories plot
8what did you have to do for it?
I think I saw it hit 8mil
no
heh the 10m viewcount was funny
EAD is that way ->

No
I saw 4mill
7Do so, then?
it's getting close to 12mil
everyone was spamming refresh to get it up faster
i've seen 5-11mil
11Well, We had to make a flash that had sections in it, using buttons to get from one section to the other.
Wait I was here for three million.
I got on the site around the time that one Dashfire Drawfriend came out.
That was not a good start to joining the community
8ah, ok
I remember the three mil comic
I think I arrived around 8mil... I know I was here for Deluge.
I have returned
At least for me
yaycogisback
Wasnt it twilight defusing the bomb? or was it earlier...
you know the password and username?
/me 7facepaws.
that reminds me i need to see some comics
7You have to make an account and decide its username and password.
bye everypony its getting late anyway
Is there a way to mod the chat so we can use e-poni-cons instead of emoticons.
lolfail
Bye!
Terrible pun ftw

11Mine had a Home Page, A Main Event Page that had Aladdin and Starship Troopers posters on it, a Past Events page with a list of all movies we've previously watched, and an About Us page where I put our Brony State names on in the color we post with. :D
In laymans terms. I want pony icons in chat.

8Awesome
4Quany, shiny?
7Very weird and unsettling typo.
disney, can you please start making sense?
Example: 4 of my steam friends changed their avatars to ponies just days after I started watching
alright, i'll be back once the thug fleet is destroyed
7Nah.
4Can you show us the flash project?
How old are you anyway?
ok which game is he talking about?
im 12
6BLARGH I'M BORED. XD
Ratchet and Clank

Which surprisingly enough I have yet to play, despite owning a PS3
10Not old enough, hurr
8lol sprinkles
4what nature?
11Wish I could, but I lost my flash drive so it's only on the school's server.
4lol?
which number i mean
4i think i was 12 when i came here
i think its 2
Ratchet and clank is good... but some of us in the EaD side were talking about

10Tartine?
7No, wait:
!todo add Create bulbapedia socket script (pokemon info script)

Because they're not lazy and when they want to do it they do it?
11Besides, I don't know how else to show it unless I just give you all the file itself.
!todo list

todo script isn't working

4i don't think so
7Chao?

The City of Ponyville

LOOOOOOOOOOOL
*Zooms out to show the CMC playing*
4Ohai
4huh, i just remembered someone telling me to add Doom Desire to my Smeargle
02o-o
That would be an awesome intro to an episode IMO
7o.O
7Uh, no.
LMFAO
4XD
THAT FLUTTERSHY COMIC
7His Sp.Atk stat is like...
4Doom Desire is a baad move
yeah
4(random flashback time)
oh god
4CARAMELLDANSEN!!!!!!!!!!!
that was the best thing ever
7I dunno, it's good.
7It's basically 140 damage.
7Even if you're waiting two turns.
>shouting out random stuff no one cares about
i still cant read it..
Okay.
These are both on the Front Page
The comics were great. Thanks for sharing!
6I dislike the poor competition that can't even make a good thread.
4lol
I didn't make them....
4that's the reason i'm shouting
4so we will care again :)
It's not a good thing lol
no one cares about your life story ;)
11?
just remember it's the internet
7Okay, I'll go with Timid for the Jirachi as well. XD
8what?
4that sounded.......sappy (honestly i have no idea what that means but i'm going with that)
11link, please
i still cant read the fluttershy comic
lol trying too hard
4XD
FUGGIN MISSCLICKS!
You can click on the picture to zoom in.
I'd say my catchphrase or something but I'm too lazy to waste the effort of typing it out
But yeah, if they made a reference to Powerpuff Girls by opening up with the CMC pretending that Ponyville is under attack, with one of them saying "The City of Ponyville...IS UNDER ATTACK" that would be awesome.
Rainbowdasponi
4sadly though, this ain't facebook
/me 4runs
6It's just Nightmare_Flash's synchtube.
And you're assuming I go on facebook.
it wont zoom in

4just poking you like on facebook

4and running
4lol
What part of "I don't go on facebook" don't you understand?
4yu left to eat didn't you?
8ooh, that was a little painful to read
10Ascedant definitely has Myspace though
02brb
8and nightmare_flash is my friend too
4and i didn't say you went on facebook
the guys in mumble think that fluttershy comic is disturbing
i'm really happy today
xD
4just that i poked you
disney: don't try seeking attention
hi
the flutterrage comic is awesome, if a little WHOA
Same here, it was a little strange at first, but it's hilarious
Yes, but you were relating that to facebook, which I have nothing to do with whatsoever
hay
And lol myspace, nah
>social networking sites
hello
HURR DURR OKAY
i'm happy
4just sayong, geez >_>
I seriously want a Powerpuff girls reference in MLP

i,i
Hey
you took me seriously? ;p
Space ;po
10Silly argument is silly, done and done
hurp a durp
ITS NOT ZOOMING
They could easily make the CMC pretend to be super heroes, with each having a color of a PPG
/me tickles Skylands with a feather
No
GO LAUGH IDIOT
/me breaks the feather
:<
/me isn't ticklish

4Ew Pikachu
/me runs

This chat is angrily slow :o

02DON'T MAKE ME BANHAMMER YOU BOI
So, does anyone want to waste time in a boring Moon-base simulator typing in the exact transcript from MLP:FiM just so we can have a robotic text-to-speech voice-over episode?
:D
;o;
/me gets tha banhammer ready

11Wait, there's a whole thread over there?
Lawrence_Gander I KNOW! I want to play it :D
02Whiny's over there, next to Alissa, who's next to Cruger
Basically what I'm saying is that my idea has little to no connection with Moonbase Alpha/pony videos
10Look who decided to show up
Oh, I think my friend read that. Said it was pretty good.
:>
yes, there is, DJ, it's called "losing chat privelages by Seth himself"
8im pretty sure !!PinkiePie said no more discussion after the sticky
6I just responded to him in WALL OF TEXT fashion.
02Sucks for you then :>
Hi

So allow me to correct myself: So, does anyone want to waste time in a Text-to-speech program typing in the exact transcript from MLP:FiM just so we can have a robotic text-to-speech voice-over episode?

I think that sort of thing would be better in #EquestrianStudy , Lawrence
02Yes
thank you
10Ew
;o
02owned?
Ew
You said Moonbase Alpha, this isn't Moonbase Alpha
hehehe
once again thanks
:)
Which is using a text to speech
daww the couple think alike
/me runs
plus
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRnq-PFboMI
Which is a boring game no one cares about.
it would sound horrible
Which is the point
/me chases after SS
8N put up a thread on /oat/
and unfunny
8basically slamming Ponychan
I'll be afk a wee bit, gonna eat dinner.

lmao
XD
Which is yours, and probably alot of others, own opinions
8ok, enjoy, doon
/me runs faster
2whatta way to get kicked o.O
I am very irate right now.
/me makes you trip.
The internet is quite pointless. Might as well do it, for the lulz.
holla holla get dolla
NO JOKES
VERY IRATE.
/me gets up and jumps in a bush
Those are old and annoying
Let's all calm down here. What would Fluttershy do?
yep
10Resistance is futile
Panic
/me burns bush
Okay, not that.
/me climbs up tree
That's her suggestion for everything.
/me also burns the tree
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Vbp9rxjs0&feature=related
^_^
Fluttershy would yell about you beating a dead horse?
fluttershy would um, tell everyone to be nice...to each other..if thats what they want.
/me flees the country
Oh no, why are we panicking?
...yay
02SKY
02DAMNIT
Now?
REV!
D'aww
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
lmao
11Well, I skimmed through it. Half of it is right and half of it is wrong, IMO.
/me burns the Earth
10There is no escape
/me flees to Mars with a fishbowl
And now I'm playing complerely Japanese Mother 2.
So, yay or neigh for a Text-to-speech recreation of MLP episodes..
11He's right in that we should be ourselves and that Drama can't be regulated. He's wrong in assuming that it's occuring because of the way Ponychan is ran.
/me kills all universes
...yay
10You have no chance to survive make your time
/me jumps in a time warp
lol
I say neigh, but do whatever the hell you want.
All your base are belong to us
haha im in teh past
Um, sorry. But It's the only way people can tell me apart...
I can't stop you
But fine..
Well, I'd watch it.
No, all your past are belong to us
/me destroys everything in existence
10Done.
LOOK AT ME I AM UNIQUE
Except nus
*Us ;3
Hi Zenith
02If I did a livestream would anyone come?
that does mean you destryoed HML
8pretty much
because you said EVERYTHING
/me flees
Capslock is so mainstream, I just hold down SHIFT
Read my line derp :p
10Nah
8but N has been a dick all week too
So, so special.
10HML called it before you did
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
/me flees
Left-shift for the win.
I USE SHIFT TOO!
10Look on the bright side
He has nothing
10No more ponies
*BROHOOF.*
I'm curious no one by the name Princess Celestia or Luna moderates here right?
:o
GOOD
I'm special, I have purple text on my screen. :)
>implying a different kind of *special*
6"LOL WE SHOULD HAVE A /THUNDERDOME/"
they see me flyin'
YAY
they hatin'
No more MLP crap!
4Oh yeah, that thing
10Except you'll be going down with the ponies~
Well, i can't see your purlpe text.
02Guess not lol
4If we had a /thunderdome/ it would essentially be 4chan
:o
*BROHOOF/FIST*
I know.
That's because you're not special.
guess that's a no
4It'd definitely give the rest of the internet a reason to make fun of us even more
/me huggles her cat
I'm not special, no.
8that was honestly one of the worst ideas i have ever heard
Who was that
8LOL LETS BE MORE LIKE 4CHAN
/me huggles Skycat ;3
I can easily see a mod for Earthbound replacing everyone with ponies
It would work SO well
I was asking if anyone by the name Princess Celestia or Luna moderated/admined here.
10Hug chain
Ponybound
lol that'd be awesome cuz I love EB
10Quick, everybody else join
Especially since there isn't a single animation for attacking in battles
Giygas.. Pinkadema..
Hells yeah.
/me hugs :p
JackiePie: nope.avi
JackiePie: I have God_Empress_Celestia as an alt nick, why?
6Everypony ignored my wall-o-text.
Oh mai
I am being hugged by SS
Good this admin from derpychat and hoofington keeps bullying me
;)
Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter
It's all just flashes and special effects, unlike games like Paper Mario or FF where we see the characters do things
;o

ZekeS: wouldn't that be Goddess Empress?
10Love brothers
I'm not participating in interserver conflicts :p
What's wrong with that?
>.>
The problem with EB
o
Is it's so goopy
Yush~
12Awesome derpy!
XD
goopy?
You got some beef with EB?
Like the programming is literally diahrea
BECAUSE I'M A VEGETAIRAN.
wrong!
yeh, sorry JackiePie...you can hang with us though! we're nice enough
The friendship must flow. The friendship is the lifeblood of Equestria. All glory to the God Empress Celestia
Yes, whoever programmed it needs to be shot
;x
2you broke the silence............with a pony?
Yeah and I'm safe here
Because it's literally like someone took a vomit onto the source code
Buses.
I ain't got TIME for your beef.
Which is, after all, the joke
Whoever controls the friendship controls the magic
/me brohoofs Nightboomfer for the Dune reference*
If the various PK Hack related tools didn't exist, hacking it would be a nightmare
Right!
12Yep
I'm not into programming, despite aspiring to be a gamedesigner, so Idk what you are talking about...
He and the other people in derpychat thinks something is wrong with me because I have Asperger's Syndrome.
hi
ZekeS, how do you register multiple nicks?
wrong!
Dune 2000!
Fooby: switch to the nick you want as your alt
Source code is a mess?
THE SPICE.
2how do you pronounce your name?
/me yawns
Problem? :>
GONNA COLLECT *ALL* THE SPICE!
Nup :>
/me yawns
2is it "ee-ex-ay-kay-are"?
10WRONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG </Batman ref>
=p
:o
2cause i say "ee-sha-ker"
EW Batman
I are dunepony. I control the spice, I control Equestria!
Wel, if someone can mod Earthbound, adding ponies would be pretty simple I would think.
Target being the new nickname? Or the word "target?"
Lex's WRONG
10w/e
Target being your old nick
spice must floooow
Fatman
10My IRL friend thinks she is batman
:3
And I get nothing in Japanese at alll...
12You don't pronounce I think
12it*
Ivan2294, all you need is a sprite artist
Awesome. Thank you very much ^^
02She thinks she's a man in tights?
Thanks god I played the english one beforehand
Then someone competent with the ingame text editor
In terms of storyline, you could easily make Earthbound an MLP game.
02Wait, no that's Robin
Gonna read ALL the Japanese!
Who would be Porky? Gilda maybe?
02wb Sneas
:D
10XD

In the EB RP we are having, Porky stars as himself.
Would it be easier to mod an existing SNES game into a Pony RPG, or is it better to just start from scratch?
Star Piece 6 get
3wb Ray
I downloaded some vectors of the MLP:FiM cutie marks and converted them to icons yesterday
Mod one
But I agree with Trixie.
4Derp
Should I release them? Y/N

Romaji is basically what the Japanese thinks of English
I think we need to see Scorpan and Tirek in FIM. In fact, my current Fanon is that Tirek is controlling Nightmare Moon and manipukated Luna.

02Livestreaming, say hi to the camera
I can accept this/
4*Yes
It is a weird game. I just started playing it a few days ago.

3ooooohhhhhhhhh
Whyy not port
And they're younger and dumber than the last batch
4Interesting!
4I want to watch
3i love manga
Eeyup.
I've been part of the EB community for 10 years
What's EB?
EarthBound :B
Derp
I have barely lived that long.
02www.livestream.com/karl3328
It's ironic that an Pony Fan is calling EB weird...
For me, try like a year.
What you mean by that is you are older and wiser than the next batch
hi Shiny~
/me hasn't seen you in so long :'<
No, they are dumber
*a
4Manga imo is really easy to read : /
cuz I'm a fucking idiot
Not wierd. Quirky.
10HI SHINY'S LIVESTREAM
I actually have 2 copies of the game for SNES, somehow. Someone just gave me one for free
:o
12i learned something interesting D:
Awws
Nightboomfer, I have 4 copies of it
hi Hooh54
4ClockworkPie, where's your friends?
Used to have 5, but I Gave one away as a gift
*lurks*
/me on camera
ARE WE GONNA KEEP USING CAPS
3D:
o3o
I have a random copy of Super Mario All-stars + Super Mario world...
err, -1 to both of those
I always forget people give a negative connotation to "weird"
I don' even own a SNES
/me 3wasn't hai'd
One near-mint SNES copy I got for $102.50, one near-mint copy of Mother 2, then a copy of M1+2 (dunno where the box went derp)
Hi
oh wait
10Perhaps
nevermind
lol
3 5 viewers
But no, EB attracts some stupid as hell fans
Kinda like Sonic and Pokemon
GUYS questions!
Nothing against any of those franchises, but let's be honest here
Nu
its failed
o3o
6I'll probably be starting the preshow at about 2:30
Sonic tops the fuckin' charts.
Seriously, can SOMEPONY here mod Earthbound?
Some sections of those fanbases are... Well. Yeah
4Viewing what?
^Sonichu. That is all
11EST, right?
I'll do it!
6Yep.
I just play the games, man, I have nothing to do with the fans.
Nah I don't give a shit about Sonichu
11Just making sure.
6No, GMT, feel like being up ALL day.
What bugs me is that that guy is a huge and total unlikable waste of a person
10Super affective
I would love to see an EB pony mod.
download PK hack and then you can mod it yourself to your heart's content
10effective*
Seriously, if you did that I would love you forever
Nup
Earthbound...
Ivan2294: I SHALL MOD MOTHER 3.
Is familiar
Revolver lollolololololol
Good look, enjoy your suicide
AS SOON AS I CAN MAKE EFFECTIVE PONY SPRITES.
Mother 3 took like 2 years to translate because the programming was even worse than EarthBound
Yeah good look
Change one thing, break 3 others
Ask a sprite artist.
10Shiny's livestream
It'll be WAY more work than that
And do Earthbound instead
*Cough*
04mew
If you're going to mod a Mother game, do EarthBound
04tired x-x
Nah, my style is much more like M3.
I saw your horrendous sprites already.
Not that bad, but still pretty bad
I know, lol.
Mother 3 is just too much of a non-euclidean c'thulu horror of prorgamming code
SS is lying :P
Was showing everbody else.
4*views*
Jeez would that be late or really early?
Bejeezus, Cog, what did you say?
Imma do just the visuals, though.
Get a better Sprite Artist than you, and mod Earthbound.
6Would what be?
why the apostrophe
2:30 AM
r'lyehian geometry is interesting
Hello bob
I would seriously pay you if it wasn't for many factors, main one being I have no money....
Hey.
6Oh, no. 2:30 PM
6EST
Sorry, this is gonna change soon, hold on...
Back to SMRPG
Oh I see...

Aren;t you gonna answer my question?
Those are actually pretty good.
There.
Better now.
and cog what did you say?
Hi Nightmare
SMRPG?
And then they modded Sonic the Hedgehog to have an OC pony as the main character
Gonna stab *all* the people!
Hello little foals.
Super Mario RPG?
8will do, silver
That would be alot harder to mod than Earthbound I would think.
8im gonna write them up during pre-show, so remind me then
GENO
Mostly because of fighting animations....
And the story.
GENO FOR THE NEXT SMASH BROS
Always gonna be with you
/brick'd
I'm confused, it there gonna be a show tonight or am I just watching this angrily slow chat?
/me hides his pile of bricks*
Gonna Believe with you

Geno's cool
But overrated

JUST LIKE THE SHOW
8we were doing a test stream earlier
A friend of mine made a thread on GFaqs about Applejack for the next Smash Bros game.
FFFFF, I WISH.
Mods deleted it for Trolling :H
Actually... I think this is a good idea. Replace Sonic with Rainbow Dash, Tails with Fluttershy, Knuckles with um... Spike? (I guess? Maybe Gilda?)
SSB4, 3DS and Wiiu, announced (sort of) at Nintendo E3 Conference 2011
Sweet.
My friends are around.
>GFaqs
Again, I wish.
I find it slightly funny that no one really noticed Nightmare Moon here...
I've found your problem.
I like being remembered for my weird phrases :D
Knuckles with Applejack?
Knuckles personality is more like Spike.
4Angrily slow
Or AJ
Good at hitting stuff.
GUYS
CogWeaver: I noticed it.
I think Sonic is more AJ
You wish what Revolver?
I meant Gameplay Mechanics wise
Inny, link to Geno. Beware, there may be spoilers if you plan on playing Super Mario RPG. http://www.mariowiki.com/geno
I wish that Applejack was in SSB4, yes.
/me blahflops
I'm not.
I wish everyone was in SSB4
Why CogWeaver... you make it sound like I'm about to go on a psychotic rampage about eternal night because nopony loves me.
You aren't?
While we're on games... anyone here play the Myst series?
EV. RY. ONE.
be careful what you ask for :p
Super Pony Fighter! Get ready for the fight of your life! (All the finishing moves are Friendships)
3Kosoveon!!!!!!!
That would just be werid to see ponies in SSB
/me 3glomps
Nightmare_Moon: >implying that you didn't think of that yourself?
I want everyone to be in SSB
8lurkers come alive
I've played it Fuzzy.
Long time ago.
I'll stay here forever.
First PC game I played.
hahaha
absurd and amazing.
When I was...nine I think.
Same here.
Waddle Dee vs Luek Skywalker vs Lyra vs Meat Boy anyone?
4Well, I see SoiPony made it
*luke
Unless my mouse keeps making me go back everytime I attack it.
4Where's that other guy though?
Same. I played the shit out of Riven too
Night, with the same creepy voice from Mortal Kombat?
11soisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoi
Who?
Yes!
/me is glomped o3o
Samuel L Jackson vs Jesus vs Robocop please.
hi ^^
yah where is that other guy
I'm about to replay Riven.
4Don't know, not Daxton
Well, that's besides the point. I swear this deal works out better for everypony. Luna gets to be alone at night holing court, while I get to enjoy the wonderful starlit sky from the crumbling roofs of Everfree Castle sipping a hayshake likely stolen from somefoal
Muwahahaha!
4Daxton appeared later
lol
4It was Clockwork, Soi, and someone else
New smash bros makes me feel obligated to purchase a Wii U
12Hey Kosovo
cho
A wild Daxton appeared?
not here
Wait name is still long
Nightmare_Moon: you worry me.
4Cho?
How long has that been like that
4His name was just Cho?
I dunno lol
just throwing names out
He was a hell of a lot better than Ness, at least.
Riven used to scare me.
6It was ChoPony or somthing... Oo
Sorry guys, gotta go. Major sh*t going down at an MC server I'm an OP for.
Bye
6Heck if I know.
Stupid...eel things.
later
lol
4Thought it looked something like that
8where are all these people coming from?
Wow...
11So, are you all from PoniBuru
Seriosuly...
Everfree forest
6Magic land, Hipster.
I have little tolerance for games like Myst. Never have.
11?*
I mean CP
04meow
Why are you gusy talking about me?
3sooooooooo
6They're new regulars, basically.
4Soi, Clockwork and their other friend were here last night
had any, I mean.
Cute Ponies?
3what's up?
Mother related stuff?
and no
Myst, Riven, etc. were FUN games
Yeah.
Of course.
4Livestream watching :3
lol
8gotcha
12Mew floof c:
*shrugs* They aren't for everyone.
4LOLCPCPCPCPCPCP
8i should stop going to sleep so early
I was always creeped out by Riven as a kid.
11Well, sorry to dissapoint, but the show isn't until tomorrow night.
04:3
same, but then I grew up
and discovered it was AWESOME
4Pretty much, and then Saturday afternoon
Now I want to play it late at night so I can get that same feeling.
it's ok
Actually, I'm more thinking about how much better he is at PK Thunder.
I'm listening to my brother's voice chat and all I hear is gun shots.
Myst was way creepier than Riven.
Ness' handles like a goddamn hog.
8...
lol
3lol
3actually i was asking Kosoveon
So annoying.
8i hope hes playing a video game
uhh
Hey everybody
I just got off Magic for this,
3i'm on livestream too
Myst was so abstract compared to the rest of the series.
Sup Mane
it better be magical in here
Call of Dooty.
Trapped in the Red and Blue books... FOREVERRR
Hopefully it'll feel less like Melee-on-the-Moon
I got really good at it on the N64 version, though.
I like it for being the original, but Riven is my favorite.
I've never really played Myst... 1000 years on the moon and what not... I have played the Myst copycat Bionicle game... that was rather fun.
It just sounds funny if you didn't know he was playing video games :P
Fuzz I've played Cyan's older games, like the ones for the Apple 2, they were even more abstract.
But then, Fire Emblem in GC.
I know the feeling
lol
02Kosoveonnnn~
Yeah, Ness' thunder seems to handle WORSE than it did in prior games, and it handled like SHIT.
/me glomps
Pony fighter: Applejack would probably use a lot of power attacks, but would be slow to attack with a good speed, Rainbow Dash would probably be a fragile speedster (and I have no idea how flight would work) Pinkie would play like Faust from Guilty Gear, Twilight and Trixie would be beamspam
ST_Falcon: I got really good at it on the N64 version.
Fire Emblem for GBA was key.
6...did the Daily /oat/ get put up today? Oo
Yeah, also, HECTOR FOR 4
WANT.
Nightboomfer: Flight would work the same way Kirby floats upward
you could do it for a long while, but eventually you'd have to stop
Many little jumps,
Hello my dear ponies
Hi
yeah, otherwise RD would just be ultra-broken
But, Gamecube version had Fire Emblem, and I kicked flank.
Hello
I don't really pay attention to the Daily /oat/
yeah, but in RD's case, they'd look like wing-flaps
speaking of pony sites....what's going on with fillydelphia?
Hallo
OhYeaPinkiePie AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
4ARGH is leaving
hai Kiniest
lol
hi
(Implying she isn't already ultra-broken)
11No, that's Argh's goodbye message.
Oh, it's pinkie pie. I've always wondered, what do yu put in your cupcakes?
Pon-- stuff.
A bit of salt. Just a pinch!
AJ'd play like DK or Dedede. RD'd be like sonic or metaknight.
The day
11There aren't enough reports to warrant a Daily /oat/ thread just yet.
hadn;t come
I just realized, my hand is attached to my arm.
6Ah.
Ponstuff?
Dedede.
11Soi: I don't know, I don't go to that sight.
AJ'd play like Dedede.
11Doon: Either put the blunt down, or pass it on.
Fluttershy'd be more like jigglypuff than anything else.
Twilight like....
Ness?
Ryu
4Why is there so much skin on my arm?
You must be going out and cutting the ingredients, then.
I have never done drugs :D
If RD would play like Sonic or Meta Knight, I would Never, ever, EVER touch her.
NO
6Preferably the latter, Doon.
Fluttershy would be an assist trophy.
IMPOSSIBLE
Twilight like Pikachu, actually
6I haven't smoked since Tuesday.
Twilight'd be like Zelda.
11The tell me which flight of steps you fell down.
RD like Meta Knight?
Okay Ponys. what is your least fav pony
>implying Assist Trophies will return
That'd be the shiz.
or maybe Mewtwo
Seriously, I've never smoked or thought of smoking, I just think of random manure to say.
She'd never fight otherwise.
People have least favorite ponies?
RD would have to handle like Sonic, fast, weak... can render anyfoal useless in the hands of a vet
I don't have a least favorite pony, but I have a least favorite griffin..
11Gotcha.
Rarity, I dunno.
Spike would play like Pichu... without the hurting himself part
Rarity. She's just the one I happen to love the least.
Rarity'd probably be more like Marth than anyone else.
My least favorite pony is applejack
Only reason rarity is saved is because of the diamond dogs episode.
I have 3 nipples.
Rarity would be AMAZING AS MARHT.
This is a tough one... My least favorite is probably Celestia :/
THAT WOULD ALSO BE THE SHIZ.
^That
I miss old marth... when he used to hurt himself after every attack or so
COUNTERING FUCKING O!
Marth is the lowest on the manly list
And Pinkie would be like Wario or G&W.
Spike VS. Bowser who would win??
Rarity, probably more like Peach. Whip her tail around, deflect with gems, etc.
Pinkie Pie.
Bowser.
okay lets say there was a button and the button when pressed destroys Rarity
*GO
Bowser, definately
WOULD YOU PRESS IT
Until Spike grows up.
Pinkie, could I... Make cupcakes with you.
/me presses said button 100000000 times*
sure
I would hit people if they attempted to hit that button.
Pfft just because I have an extra arm doesn't mean I've been exposed to nuclear wastes.
Then hit the button for them.
...?
I have learned something
anger makes me curse far too much.
Derpy could be like Taskmaster in MVC
I can see pinkie as Zelda really
Pinkie as Deadpool/BB Hood
Toon Link
Hurray oh chamomile tea, with your calmy calminess
3gtg
Who would Pinkie Pie play like?
Pinkie/Pinkamena
Ice Climbers.
Pinkie = Navi
3good night to all fellow TSTers
ﾄﾅｽｲ
cupcakes
Haa, Nightmare_Moon's already ahead of me.
Sure
Dang japanese type righting
JackiePie: Am I the only one here that knows how to pronounce that?
3sowwy
Pinkie would just be Pinkie
3i found celebi
11Woah. *pokes the arm*
3but not jirachi
Ka-mo-meel?
3ill keep looking
she'd have her own fighting style
Hey don't touch my 2nd arm.
6pssst silver
Her super move would be PANCAKES
THAT or she'd fight like crazy-hand...
7Thank you.
6I'm in ur email readin ur drafts
Cupcakes
lol
Damn, Fooby, You're good.
^ Yes. Nuff said
Nightmare Moon I could see being like Sentinel
I got it, Pinkie would handle like Samus, after smash attack she goes into Pinkamena mode
DUDE YES, Pinkie would be the boss at the end of the single-player
I love my tea <3
I CAN IMAGINE FINAL SMASH!
Pinkie = Crazy Hand
Does Fluttershy have a crush on spike?
Y/Y
Cupcakes
Someone just make a damn ponyfied SSB-flash.
PLEASE
Y
PINKAMENA FLASHING ACROSS THE SCREEN ONCE, AND ALL OF THE ENEMIES ARE TURNED INTO 'Freinds'.
XD
XD
WHICH SHE CAN EASILY BUCK OFF THE SCREEN.
Seizures hurray!
Wait...
Rev, caps...
Everyone's a bucket of turnips
Critical hit
wait...
wait...
Sorry, excited rampage.
Pinkie, would you like me to count up to my favorite character?
6And it flew real low
11GET OUT OF MAH HEAD!
6And it flew real low
np :P
11GET OUT OF MAH HEEEAAAAD!
sure
lol
11Wait...are you watching me as I edit it?
Nice going Sprinkles I can't remember anymore. :<
6I like the centered setup better than the old one.
I can see Pinkie whipping out her music set as a final smash and summoning a horde of parasprites.
No, all enemies turned into cupcakes!
6And yes.
6. Applejack
I'm LOYAL to RAINBOW DASH.
Confound these ponies. They drive me to write insane crossovers.
One at a time or all at once?
Lolololol.
lol That would be awesome SillyNilly
11DudeThat'sCreepy.jpg
one at a time
Brohoof
5. Rarity
6Every time you save the draft. XD
/me yawns
4. Rainbow Dash
11How's the shortening of the content warning?
AKA Claus
Neat
3. Twilight Sparkle
???
6Looks good to me.
2. Fluttershy
1. Pinkie Piw
12Floofy :3
/me yawns too
Oh Yea!
Stages: Cloudsdale, Appleloosa Train, Canterlot Courtyard, Sugarcube Corner, The Everfree Forest, Froggy Bottom Bog
Decent
...I can't spell that last one right
11I'm trying to set up a basic structure so I can copy/paste rather than typing a whole new one each time.
Twilight's Library
lol
LF> Edit Button
Pinkie Piw!? Is that the Missing No of Pokemon?
hi
*troll face*
PinkiePi?
6Make the Post-Show say something under it though...
Pinkie Pi
Applejack? Best?
I was thinking that
6It looks odd blank.
D:
YES
OMG
Pinkie Pi
AJ is THE BEST
11I kinda drew a blank at that.
Hooves down
Did we do that?
Speaking of applejack... any suggestions for a hat for her toy?
Don't worry, Pinkie, I love your parties. And these exquisite cupcakes.
I advocate for Fluttershy!
Something cheap, preferrable
*omnomnom* Wow! What do you put in them?!
8im confused by these proceedings
AJ is the bestest pony ever, and I will love and tolerate anyone who says otherwise.
6XD
If, um... that's alright...
She's just another southern character
I understand perfectly.
6I'm watching him write up a draft in the BMN email account.
11There.
Although the tree episode started hilarious
*loves and tolerates Kiniest*
6Looks good.
oO_
I agree, Inny
"Um, you know she's not a tree, right?" "I wish I was a tree"
I'll have to disagree with that, Luna truly is the best pony, she let me feed off her misery, pain and anguish for 1000 years. Shame it was over so soon...
The sea ponies are the best
^'
/me will LOVE and TOLERATE the MEADOW MUFFINS out of anypony that disagrees to Applejack being the best pony*
Luna got ONE cutscene.
lol
For some reason I wanna ponify an Ed, Edd 'n Eddy scene :d
30.0 seconds of screen time
/me follows suit
>_>
Hi
But...Luna has an abacus!
30.0 exact?
That's not canon, Inny
30 seconds flat?
+/- a second or two
Nightmare, someone told me you were talking about me.
Says you!
I'm going to have to pull out my stopwatch.
8silver
/me cuddles the fuck out of Luna "you poor poor lonely pony..all those years alone"
11Thursday Update email has been sent. Structure of it has been saved to a word document.
8you might want to say the pre-show starts "around" 2
it's not canon, it's fanon
*snuggles DJMidli*
You know what this show needs?! A TSUNDERE. *cricket chirps*
Hay watch your language
I grew up with the Star Wars prequels! I can decide what's canon!
touche
6LOL WHEN MY EMAIL GETS MARKED AS SPAM
/me opens google
I seriously want to zap the shit out of DJMidi for touching my younger stepsister.
... wait WHAT now?
I thought Fluttershy was the Tsundre
Why Luna! What a pleasent surprise visiting me at the old castle. Was court getting too boring for you alone? I hope those night ponies weren't making your session too frustrating tonight
6I'll be here by 2 I'm sure.
Fluttershy is a YANDERE
11lol
8ok
Ooooh
11Nice.
right
tsundere*
also luna has taken over my number two pony spot from RBD
That what you don;t like, DJ?
fluttershy is a tsundere
she's nice
except when people fuck with her
11I'll add your name to the contacts list, Sprinkles. I set up a special group for the mods.
like the cockatrice and dragon
8i have no idea when im getting out of work, should be by 2:30 at the latest though
Kiniest: no, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy is the yandere of the cast
but she's also a yandere
D:
8hell, i might be back by 10, i dunno
A tsundere is a character who seems really cold but shows a warm side when you're used to them.
They were actually, not that you really care anyway. And what are you doing in my castle? My sister banished you.
you're going to LOVE ME
Zeke, that's what I said
<_<
Un-pronounce-able names hurt my eyes.
you said tsun, not yan
We already love you, Zeke
I said Yan
LolkiddingIcanpronouncethat.
[21:08:54] Fluttershy is a YANDERE
oh
6I saw, silver. XD
who said tsundere then
NEED BANNING
10Well, I'm off
<Kiniest> A tsundere is a character who seems really cold but shows a warm side when you're used to them.
plz stop using weab terms...
Or the other way around.
I'm spacing out, alot.
weaboo weaboo
I said that
DJ, it's not a "weeaboo" term.
I need to change my name...
you need banning, Zeke? can mods ban mods?
And then DJ should be prision away in the ethernal realm...
Fluttershy rarely ever has shown a could side
Weeaboo terms would be gratuitious Japanese like KONICHIWAAAA
6I love how it doesn't have my name, btw.
DJ stop making fun of ponies because you lack knowledge of Japanese culture.
DERP
MPR unless your japanese yourself it is.
11Just changed that. :P
Tsundere is a word for which there is no replacement in English
D:
So it's a loanword.
i wasn't making fun of ponies.
Bai
:>
We steal words from other languages.
DJMidli: err, it's a pretty common term these days
alright
6...I saw.
6Live.
With a precise definition.
^
6It creeped me out a little.
If you feel like giving people grief over it, I'll give YOU grief.
K as twilight says
4Live?
FIEN
how is everyone?
Kind of like alot of our latin words and crap
my god.
6I'm watching him do things on the email account. XD
Mods seem to like threatening me here tonight
sorr DJMidli
bored and derped
you?
sorry
Why Luna, I'm at Everfree, the surrrounding forest gives a wonderful vista of the sky above. As for why I'm here, well it's rather difficult to resist manifesting myself from the remains of my armor when ponies just droon on and on about who is best. the in-fighting, it's so delicious.
tired and bored :|
4Hey, Silver, would you add me to that list?
nobody to play with as usual
:|
lol
JackiePie you have nothing to apologize for bro(ny) <3
Love and tolerate the shit out of him instead.
Nightmare_Moon, did you enjoy the fanfic "cupcakes"?
IMMA CHANGED NAMES
/me pokes LL to the livestream
I loved cupcakes
Nightmare Moon... You are just curropted...
6Send an email to it, silly.
DJMidli, I'm still getting used to being social having Asperger's Syndrome, I tend to misunderstand social situations sometimes.
;-;
JackiePie no worries *hug*
Well at least you understand
11Ghosties: Just send an email. BronyState@Gmail.com
unlike those...nope not going there
or just a image by now...
There was this guy on gamefaqs who said "Aspergers people are creeps"
Kiniest, I clop to grimdark, it made me giggle.
I hate judgmental things like that
I'm not even going to play into your games this time Nightmare, you're not as good at lying as you used to be. I guess being stuck with no one but me for 1000 years took your edge away.
Curropt as hell////
Kiniest yeah, well they're immature.
Nightmare Moon, aren't you still on the moon?
8shaving with sunburn on my chin
8i am in hell
4Sent
I suppose we do have a similarity there Nightmare.
11Joy.
Luna's on earth.
I have AS too, just so you know.
4You should have an email by now ^_^
Kiniest I was banned from Hoofington and Derpychat because they've allowed a tyrant to admin.
He thinks having Asperger's Syndrome is an excuse not a real condition.
hey I got an email yay~
lol
*corrupt
Luna: T/F, you were going to meet TS's friends on the night of the Gala, but saw Fluttershy and decided not too.
is it bad if I wish I was diagnosed an aspie so I had an excuse for my behavior
lets leave Aspergers out of the topic please
And Nightmare, please stay away.
okay
so yeah.
[Warning: File Luna.pny is corrupt. Changing name to Nightmare Moon. Windows is hibernating...]
@kiniest, She was pretty hot that night.
[Forever]
Not.... forever
This chat is so slow I can't even follow it :U
lol chatkill
Well, you know, beware the cute ones.
/me collapses in a heap
No worries, I use a MAC, woot.
alright now wtf is going on
...* looks at Luna * I gotta go...
Macs ftw
I have assburgers. I cope by keeping my retard mouth shut.
Yep :P
^ >_>
11Awesome.
I am as well
what have i done
/me on tablet .-.
Oh dear.
Oh dear indeed
You guys are just feeding Nightmare here, quit bickering, please.
Just to let you know, Falcon. I've roleplayed Rena Ryugu before.
11Sweet. That means you got one too. :)
yup
I can do it again.
8our chat is pretty much for mod stuff and maintenance on off-nights, so its really slow moving
oatmeal
I'm sad, or I'm just bored it's hard to tell...
everyone listen to Luna and calm your pony flanks!
02Mmk
D=
aME LOL
QUICK
Luuuuna.... are you saying I should just hold you back from lowering the moon tonight and unleash total terror upon the citizens of Equestria? That sounds like a marvelously terrible idea. The ponies will get bored too quickly if such a cataclismic event happens on too regular a basis you know.
Thank you, weeaboo.
8on movie nights, it goes to turbo mode really fast
6I'd stream if I had anything worth streaming atm.
I mean, DJMidli.
fALLOUT nEW vEGAS OR mAGIC 2012
I plan on driving the Pope mobile.
VOLTEKKA
yay
caps win
xD
NM. Be quiet before I stab you just like I did Trixie the other day
CRUISE CONTROL FOR AWESOME.
lol
Alright, Luna...
12bbl
11:O Sprinkles, did you beat me to the punch with Ghostie's email?
4CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
4god
Let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby and buy ourselves a treat.
8even with cruise control, you still have to steer
Yes Princess.
I HATE STEERING.
4Wait, what about my email?
I never said anything about that Nightmare. Go away or I'll call Celestia.
Neighslayers.
11I went to add you to the contacts and group lists, and apparently Sprinkles beat me to it.
Oopsy, computer crashed. :P
That would make an awesome video game "Neigh Slayers"
>=(
I fail at Touhou
lol
Ooo! Sister would be delighted to have such a wonderful family reunion again, this time though we'll all be there, the three of us, forever.
11Sounds like the Pony version of Evil Dead or something.
Radical.
4Sprinkles be trolling you
The Great and Powerful Trixie vs. The World
6I did beat you to the punch, Silver.
*must... resist... stabbing urges...*
Nightmare moon = Pinkie pie?? D:
4Wait, so explain to me: Do both Silver and Sprinkles have access to the bronystate email right now?
I'm decent at Touhou
i wonder if prince celestia has her own nightmare moon
like Nighmare Sun?
222/222 caps in Imperishable Night
Took me a month
You're not part of my family Nightmare, you never were! I don't know how I let myself believe you were all those years, but I suppose I had no choice. Now I do, and I won't let you control me anymore!
6Most of us have the password to it.
11Yeah. I gave all the mods the password to the account when it was made.
You tell her Luna!
kaguya's l cards took SO RIDICULOUSLY ANNOYINGLY LONG
4>:I >mfw I don't have the password
Emmi: I meant that slideshow thing for windows, bah, I am too drunk to remember the name
xD
for great justice.
/me defends Luna from Nightmare_Moon
6And yeah, we can both do whatever currently.
luna?
can I hug you?
6lol
I wanna make a game but I dunno what to make...
11Ghosties. PM.
(how do you guys do the bold and italic text, by the way?)
Wait.
4Maybe I should just be in chat more often XI
Fluttershy, i'm really happy for you, and i'll let you finish
DJMidli: it'd be Daymare Sun, if anything
the battle parts in bowser's keep in SMRPG take too long
Sure MPR, bring it in *hugs*
8sigh, epic mount just backed out of the ponykart project
but Luna is the cutest pony of all time
Luna, using an irc client or the ED one?
OF ALL TIME
8back to square one
ED
/me hugs Luna with a D'AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
whats it called?
11Ponykart?
6Aww.
Hey! I can ignore myself! :D
6I liked that project.
power something
Um, in mIRC, ctrl+b works, not sure if it works in that chat client
i'll test it
powerpoke?
You can play as different characters then just Reimu and Marisa?
R>Then bold
6XD Doon

I'm ignoring myself now.

I am hungry

oh hi?
bold is annoying as fuck though

8yeah, we were gonna make a mariokart style game, but with pony characters, tracks, items, etc...
asdf asdf asdf
Louder...
Just had a poutine
Turn off Bold please, children

So in 6 you're stuck with just R and N?
lol, DJ
11I'm swamped as it is with this, the Daily /oat/ and my final projects.
4Bye :3
I stopped ignoring myself, I realized ignoring my self is bad.
I can't get past stage 3 in Normal without losing a credit D:
11Not only that, but I don't have any experience in game makings, so I can't help you there.
Oh well, no bolded bits for me :/
Ahahahaha. I have no intention of controlling you, why stirr up trouble with family when I'm finally free, FREE to roam Equestria as I see fit. Unshackled from the hate and spite of all ponykind that grew from your jeaslousy of our sister.
I used Game Maker 8, just needs an idea and stuff.

Someone rang?
"r....e....s...is....t u....rge....."
Oh, hi Luna! ... and Nightmare Moon.

Why hello, sister. Have you come to enjoy hayshakes with me on the roofs of Everfree Castle?
awkward
Kiniest, it's called "PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE"
yeah, but that does the whole thing that i type, not little bits
6...how long has this muffin wrapper been next to me? Oo
8its cool, silver, i think theres some people in the /collab/ thread that want to help out
Watch videos on strategy, too.
Q_Q
....I'm just gonna go...place.
8FOREVERRRRRRRRR
You'll get better and it feels fantastic
(or atleast, whatever's LEFT of the roofs of Everfree Castle...)
But I can't even beat Hell in Cave Story
6Apparently.
I've never played Cave Story
Sounds like a superior idea, NMM! Let's!
Sprinkles, I think we have the same stalker.
but i'm pretty sure it's not a shmup
but you know what?
czdjbvksbdjv
You can do ANYTHING with enough grinding.
Well

Muffins are just ugly cupcakes.

4Nah, Sprinkles is Pinkie
8false
11Howso, Ghosties?
4We've already discussed it
You see Luna? Sister's accepted me as one of the family, why can't you?
You should come have shakes with us! It'll be fun!

6WOW
zalgo comes to screw up equestria, gets zombie pony followers, mane cast+derpy thwart him. <_<

:3
I am senior sparkling tiger.
MPR #1 cheese
see you, Luna
I shall fly to the sun and come back with a glorious feast.
Oh. Sounds cool.
Make Derpy join the zombies!
8...
Do want!
Better then my idea.
Of sun dinosaurs.
Nightmare_Moon: NMM was a pretty poor villian tbh
Derpy = leader of zombies.
Tasty tasty sun dinosaurs.
Derpy is too ossim to be leader of zombies
YES
Needed more time to fully explore/have a semblance of a real plan :p
>.> *idea involves Planescape Torment/Pony crossover*
I only had... what, 4 hours of time?
also I need to do a firefly mlp crossover
4I added myself to the contact list
MPR, haven't you seen that pic of the mane 6 vs hordes of zombies? Derpy's in the bg
and she's NORMAL
no, I haven't
link?
1,000 years, 4 hours, 32 minutes, 4 seconds.
AND YES, YOU DO NEED TO DO A FIREFLY CROSSOVER, AND I'M SO SORRY FOR USING ALL CAPS
6LOL
/me is BACKNESS

The plan was simple, return from banishment, send Celestia to the sun, stop the moon and sun cycle in eternal night.
so what are you guys talkin' about
Someone say Firefly?
*works on his fic quietly*
~~JAYNE!! The colt they call JAYNE!!!~~

Glad to hear it.
Firefly, Charlie Sheen, and ponies. This, good people, is the internet at its best.
mane_attraction already been done
eeeyup, mane_attraction
Who wants to start a war with ponies?
why?
Why?
ponies don't go to war
^Please!
6We are officially having too much fun with this.
Why not?
Y?
I could take them all on, you zetta moron.
>.<
unless a dwarf is ridin the pony
Sounds fun.
mane_attraction ill find the video for you.
if we went to war, I'd side with the ponies
yup.
War against the Diamond Dogs?
Oh.
11For whoever asked, I have a bad habbit of clearing my inbox.
Not Close Enough
mkay
I'd side with the turdles
4IT WAS ME SILVER
It NEEDS to be ponies
I have been thinking about starting the resistance back up. These ponies are pretty virtuous, they'd make good fighters.
War against the diamond dogs?
4IT WAS ME ALL ALONG ASKING
You braindead binomials
PONIES AND CHARLEE SHEEN http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=axf9_BD8JHs
I can get behind that.
6It's not a big deal. XD
I think you're right captain.
4Yeah, Silver, Sprinks and myself are changing the status message constantly
No it was ME :U
11Once I receive an email and do whatever I need to in response, I erase it.
11I noticed, Ghosties.
wait...Cap'n, is Celestia Aliance?
*never really liked Firefly*
wait, duh, of course she is...
It's raining outside.
4Back!
4Man, maybe I should have you manage my inbox Silver
It sounds great, but now that I think of it, the Diamond Dogs don't seem to be a large group.
11Enjoyment I anticipate after performing said activity
Would be a short war. :/
4With... No body here
4You have no idea how much email I still have in my inbox >_______>
4!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
"Blue Sun" and all that...it's obvious that Celestia'd be the head of the Alliance
It had me at AJ's /trollface
I may make banners, read fanfic, chat with other fellow bronies, and watch PMVs, but as soon as ponies attack humans, or take over Texas, I will renounce my Loyalty to Celestia. I will however still claim to be a brony.
Celestia! ADMIT IT! You're secretely a Russian spy!
<%CogWeaver> "Blue Sun" and all that...it's obvious that Celestia'd be the head of the Alliance
Why would the ponies take over Texas?
ooh, fair point
<Inigo> *never really liked Firefly*
Um
SHUN SHUN SHUN
D:
*is shuned*
Your goal is to learn about friendship to make friends kill each other for ORDER!
shun the non-believer! shun shuuun!
sHUUUUUN!!
*Sequester*
Well, let the man be honest here, he's not the first to dislike me after all ;)
It's my darkest secret!
*shuns*
Adolai Nizhka ;)
I thought our darkest secret was liking ponies?
I remember him
I tried liking the show...but it was just...boring!
Inigo then wtf are you doing here
My darkest secret is my bisexuality.
Okaaaay then......
anyways, how's the crew holdin' up, Cap'n?
>.< What?
No, I like ponies. I don't like Firefly.
That's cute.
I can like ponies still, right?
8why in gods name is there an ad for "BBWDatefinder.com" above my chat window?
8DO NOT WANT
yeah, why wouldn't you...
4AHAHAHAHAHA
We all know that Luna only acts cute around her sister.
We have to love and tolerate the shit out of him.
Hahaha! Weird ads.
Yup
no, you can't Inigo. You can only LOVE ponies
Also, what is firefly? (Partially takes cover behind a small flame sheild)
but no "liking" them
Crew's doin' well CW, Jayne's got a gunshot in his arm but he'll be alright, other than that everything's gorram beautiful.
Loving poniees isn't a very dark secret.
*loves ponies*
WHAT. IS. FIRE. FLY.
Firefly is a scifi-western that takes place many, many, maaaany years in the future where mankind had to leave Earth due to it's resources running out
The best thing (next to ponies) to happen to TV.
It got canceled.
.YLF. ERIF. SI. TAHW
Okay.......
And then the alliance came. China+USA.
Why should I care?
8i freaked out when the mario ad came on during super mario bros last week
it got canceled after it's first season BECAUSE FOX IS DUMB AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
6lulz
4Seriously, who keeps resetting
Inigo my bad xD i thought you where talking about mlp
Took all of our rights. I fought in the resistance but there was only so much we could do; now I'm a smuggler.
Luna. Is this true or not?! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/16191?search=favorited_by%3DPonyRIG
4You can't erase posts here, so COME FORTH!
6Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood parasprite.
Why didn't they just transfer the rights to scifi?
[INSERT SOMETHING INTERESTING]
same reason you'd care about ANY story, Ivan. it's entertaining at the very least!
makes sense to me.
But I don't really care about Luna, or the other characters.
I like them, but don't care.
because, like I said, NmM, FOX IS DUMB AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED
^
8alright guys, im off to bed
Not really how it went, but yeah Fluttershy's the reason I wasn't there.
8ill see you all tomorrow for BMN
6Later Hipster
11I'm making a Gmail profile now. :D
11Seeya tomorrow, Hipster.
11G'night.
4See ya Hipster
Speaking of great shows, The Walking Dead Season 2 CANTWAITOMG
Bai whoever is leaving.
/me 4will go over the profile once Silverscreen is done
Eh. Zombies are so mainstream. *puts on hipster glasses, gets shot*
Fluttershy had too much love for my little sister to handle.
Same with HotD
also: MLP Season 2 coming soon! CANTWAITOMGSH!!!
*is dead*
I'm suprised it wasn't Fluttershy who was the villian of cupcakes
Little sister, but your...she is...WTF
No offense taken Ivan, if you were wondering.
4It's so weird seeing an empty inbox
Hey.
...coming soon? The animation just started.
Hey guise.
Okay
Cog, it's gonna suck, Faust isn't leading anymore.
Guess what?
Um... no
I'm the spicepony.
>implying she is the only reason it worked
Bahaha, too much love? She was more of a screamer than I am hahaha
Gonna gather *ALL* the spice!
11XD
You ponies sure are an interesting bunch hehehe.
Kiniest: You're being silly, Faust worked through season 2, season three is out of her controll though
Well then
Season 2: Still good
Doom 2 on ultra violence is hard D:
I fear for season 3
I still have hope for season three.
Season 2, who's taking over?
i doubt that seasons 2 or 3 is gonna slip
4What port?
port?
4Yeah. XBLA, PC?
PC
DosBox
4Ah
4Nice
Yeah, we're more interestin' than mudders on Jayne-day, Cap'n. Don't get freaked out by us or anythin
What you guys think will happen is that it'll somehow revert to G3.
*checks if progress updated*
ya
What will actually ahppen: Executive Producer - Someone else.
Who is taking over?!?
I just killed my self from trying to blow up a Mancubus.
4What level?
Hah, it's okay, y'all know I've seen freakier.
11Okay, you can look at it now, Ghosties.
they won't let it fall to THAT level again
;)
I took that off of a picture I saw a while back, but I can't find it.
MAP12
At least, that's what I heard.
I still get nightmares about going through that Reaver territory.
6No introduction?
Gonna stab *ALL* the people!
I'm so happy!
4It looks decent Silver
11?
4Introduction?
4MAP12...
4I know that's not Dead Simple because that's MAP08, I think
Worst Case Scenario of a Pony Invasion. IT. IS. NOT. G4.
Wait, when'd you do that Cap'n?
6Was talking about Silver.
I really can't wait for Season 2.
Ivan2294: FFFFFFFFFFF
so many returning characters
If that was the case, would you guys then join the human resistance?
and GILD
4What do you mean by introduction, Sprinkles?
Gilda*
....um, epsiode 1 of Firefly
6On the profile
11I set one, but I don't know why it didn't save it.
Ivan2294: I WOULD DIE. ON THE SPOT.
The Factory :D
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
On my way to Miranda, remember?
4Ohhhh, that's when you're back on Earth
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh70hyW31e1qez5nfo1_500.png
That's dissapointing.
GONNA STAB ALL THE PEOPLE
wtflol
Lolmypointexactly
Miranda? Never heard of it. you sure you didn't just dream of it Cap'n?
But I dun wanna be stabbed sir.
Revolver, how would you see through the welding mask? :|
Watch Serenity OMG! Best movie ever!!
(btw, I have seen Serenity, just...it should never have happened...)
So, if Pre-G4 ponies were to invade, who would join the human resistance?
THEN MAKE PONY INVASION G4.
He can't. It's a stab in the dark.
The planet, Miranda, how did you miss that bit?
Luna: By the power of John DeFoe.
I would join, sir.
11Introduction added.
4Where can I view it?
Miranda is an orange soda Captain_Reynolds.
And a good one at that.
That's an earch author, right?
fck miranda.
aaaanyways, you said somethin' about raisin' the Browncoats here with the pony-folk, Cap'n?
faygo all the way!
To each his own
4Also, what's the deal with the staff tab?
Yeah I was thinkin they'd have a stake in fightin' the oppression and such.
If G3 ponies invaded, I would have Doctor Whoof lead an invasion through time and SPAAAAACE!
4I figured we'd be in it, but it's empty : /
I'm still gonna stab ALL the people while still being insanely cute.
Lauren Faust left MLP.... to go and bring back Firefly! Oh... my.
I still say that if G4 ponies invade, they'll kill us all for not being friendship-ish enough. That's why I'm trying to find recruits for the inevitable Zombie/Robot/Alien/Pony combined-invasion.
grr stab kill
kill stab grr
I mean Earth
unsuccesfull troll is unsuccesfull(for the record miranda is pretty damn good.)
Doctor Whoof is a good man. He would never go to war...
Ivan2294: I would GLADLY die for the Pony cause.
True
Except against the Dailecs
okay, so if no one else is currently writing a Firefly/MLP fic, does anyone mind if I do?
or w.e.
6It doesn't need anything in it really.
Who's Firefly again?
11I was jumping around with names.
lolz
Go Cog Go!
Nope.
Okay, how about this. Combined invasion. G1 - 4 ponies all invade. If you want to keep G3 from taking ove the world, you still have to fight all other generations.
Which side would you take.
I've got no problem with it Cog.
11both of those removed. :P
I fucking hate that teleporter!
man...why does so much stuff combine so well with MLP?!? I have so many cross-over ideas...
It's a damn Mancubus trap :U
First I'd offer to be a spah, but then, if not, I'd surrender to the Ponies.
Does anyone mind if I make the Planescape Torment/MLP fic?
4In any case, where can I view the introduction?
Because MLP is godly.
mane, demon's run when good men go to war.
spah?
PLANESCAPE TORMENT
demons ran.
6Profile
FFFFFFFFFF
11refresh the Profile page
Hi
What is a spah?
Such. A. Good. Episode. BTW, it was meant to be ironic humour.
Hey, jackie!
Ivan2294: SPY. IVAN, Y U NO RECOGNISE TF2 MEMES?
Have fun last night? ;D
DAT REVOLVER'S AH SPAH
Okay, before I spend time writing the Firefly/MLP fic, I need to begin that Bone/MLP fic I've been thinkin' about for a while...
11Just changed it again to add the link to this place.
4Ahhh
Bone?
yes, Bone
Because I don't play TF2 *Flame Shields to max, Troll resistors online, hate dissapators at full capacity*
Boone?
Hello
Revolver, are you okay?
y'know..."Out from Boneville"?
4wait, did you link it to dinkypage?
What's Bone?
4If not, I'll add that
have none of you guys read Bone???
11I just added that.
Inigo: FFFFFFFFFF, NO.
I haven't, but I know what you're talking about
I have
Why not Revolver?
CogWeaver: I DID.
oh good
The entire deamn series
Nope.
No, sorry. We don't get much Earth literature over here.
COMPLETELY FORGOT, THOUGH.
awesome and epic as hell
good, okay
They did a Top Gear/Pony crossover.
Que?
That was okay.
Luna's on a roll tonight.
4Added it as well in the side link
I want to see The Stig with a cutiemark
4Refresh
So who agrees a Bone/MLP cross-over would be awesome?
4to see it
Inigo: Because, I'm gonna stab *ALL* the people! Yay!
*raises hand*
11oh.
S:
I seriously want a Kirby/MLP crossover. Obviously Kirby crashed on Equestria and Fluttershy should be the one to find/befriend him first.
She's really getting me kindof hot, mane.
11then I can take it out of the intro
just have the 3 mane Bones meet up with the ponies
Non
Bone crossover would be really interesting
4Sure
Ivan, you are correct sir.
4I don't see why not
11done
and make a conflict with those giant ass rats
I can actually see that crossover working!
Oh come on. Morte would be awesome in Equestria.
4Unless people start saying it's difficult to find the stream
He could meet Pinkie Pie!
"STUPID, STUPID RAT-CREATURES!"
Incorrect! *STAB* AH HAH HAH HAH, NOW YOU ARE CORRECT.
Stabbing makes everything better.
*dodges*
Yesh.
I want to have Rarity say that line...
Nyan
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh70hyW31e1qez5nfo1_500.png
I don't want to write it myself because, 1. I suck at stories 2. I WILL KILL MYSELF BEFORE I WRITE A FANFIC FOR ANYTHING, EVEN PONIES.
GONNA STAB *ALL* THE PEOPLE!
Lawd
*stabs self*
Hah, just kidding, prop knife.
Rarity=Takano
Got you!
>implying its possible to stab me.
Lol, knife prop.
11Honestly the profile is trivial as the majority of viewers come from Pony sites, I just did it for the enjoyment I anticipate after doing said activity.
*Stabs*
So much fun!
I wanna write fanfic but I do not has a creative. feelsbadman.jpg
*Stabs*
Ah, lol.
And the nameless one can have no cutie mark!
ivan you do know that what you wrote just said
okay, so if I don't do a concrete Bone/MLP fanfic, I at least wanna do a fanfic based off of the great cow race...that thing was EPIIIIIC
implying implying it's possible to stab me
/me rawrs~
I may write a fanfic..but everytime i start, I think..'or i could write music'
silly filly
So, someone PLZ MKE KRBY/MLP CRSVR
DERP!
then I go play my keygoard
keyboard* lol.
You'll need to go to Indonesia to stab Shai
4Nya
Ivan2294: I WOULD make a Kirby crossover, BUT YOU WON'T LET ME STAB YOU.
Kirby, that name sounds familiar.
Ivan2294: Also, you don't play TF2.
MLP/Half-Life crossover. CALLED IT!!!
FFFF
YOU ASS
Is he pink?
I like Tf2, I just don't play it.
BEAT ME TO IT
headed to bed later all
Muhahahaha
Same here Ivan
Luna...
And square? Wait, no, round. he was round, right?
Luna: Only the pinkie-est.
I think an interesting cross over would be mlp with lord of the rings, if that hasn't been done yet
So, I will let you stab me, NON-FATALY if you write a GOOD Kirby/MLP crossover
11Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be heading off to play some Phoenix Wright before bed.
Only AFTER you do that.
NO
*giggles* I think I met him once.
6XD
YOU MUST DIE.
THEN GET RESURECTED
THEN DIE AGAIN.
Luna?
FINE, but only AFTER you write it.
We had some *fun* for a while, but he had to get back home.
11Yeah, DCD got me addicted to it. Flankhole. :P
AND I WILL WRITE IT FOR YOUR GHOST.
4Have a good night, Silver !
NOPE.
11G'night!
Sometimes I miss him. He was really good at eating ;)
11See y'all tomorrow!
4See you then
IF YOU REFUSE THEN YOU MUST DIE *Pulls out Ak-107*
6See ya.
Cya whoever's leaving.
Rev: Stop using Caps
Okay
Woah woah. Easier there.
Lol, fine.
Nope.

Tooo late, you're dead.
Trollface.jpg

I write nothing for dead people.

Seriously though, Kirby/MLP crossover, someone needs to do it.
*and no one died*
02z-z
As much as I dislike Nightmare for most things, she did make me a bit kinky hehe...
I can image Kirby being good friends with fluttershy, since he is so niave and quiet.
*Cake.jpg takes you to 404 error*... the cake was a lie. trollface,jpg
Or him eating all the food at Pinkie's Parties.
I want to do a Cardcaptor Sakura/MLP crossover, but other than having the idea, I haven't really pursued it.
just kidding i posted pinkie pie
Or all the apples at AJ's farm.
hi
You're an interesting girl Luna. We should hang out some time.

Heh, don't you worry about that.
Meh both are good. :3

Neigh neigh neigh neigh, neigh... Eeeeeeeeheeeeheeeeeheee
*trot trot trot*
I like science better. Because I'm one of those people who likes to think about what will happen in the future. Speaking of which, I think space wars shall be fought with Rail Guns and Thermal Laser Beams.
Mostly Rail Guns
pew pew
RAAAWWWRRRRRR
WHAAAAAAAAAAA
You speak for everyone.
You to, Cthulu.
Who speaks for what now?

*sticks hooves out in front of face*
Do we have to go back in time and kill H.P. Lovecraft do we?
4That emote is not representative of my current emotions
i stopped spamming :(
Just saw the EqD post about possible DVDs.
4In fact, I'm firing that emote right now
lolfail
We can stab him :D
4Get out of here
*cries while walking back to juarez*
:D
I love how they assumed the person was talking about their 5-year-old son, not daughter.
Buying Cartoons?
I hate downtown D:
screw you
As if.
I like science because Genius: The Transgression is fun.
I just heard somepony mention conversion bureus... is sister really going to go through with that?
I want the incidental music
4Love downtown map
4You start in a wide open area
*gets another idea for a horrible crossover*
6What playing?
4With imps and arachotrons shooting you from all directions
Go on....
That's a lie Nightmare, that's a rumor and a lie!
never gonna give you up
So many jerks D:
never gonna let you down
4Doom II
6Oh.
never gonna run around an desert you
6Never played. Looks good though.
never gonna make you cry
...
never gonna say goodbye
you guys know there's a seperate channel for roleplaying right?
never gonna say goodbye?
I bet there's plenty of zombies with weed on them atleast :D
never gonna tell a lie
That's also enough User_2349 :s
and hurt you

damn it
Why are you two existing at the same time-CELESTIA-DAMNYOUPONYPHYSICS

Woah
4Seriously
Pg
you mad
4One of the greatest games ever
lol
u mad?
its u mad
6If I was able to, I probably would.
I love you guys.
The first time I played was when I was 5.
not y"you"
Well, I heard rumor that a sickeningly cheery pink earth pony created ponification potions in her kitchen. Of course, it's only rumor
So fun.
6I'll probably look into it.
~yay~
Nightmare, you're not saying... with him? *giggles*
4It was the first FPS I ever played
*imitates giggle*
*tilts head*
Test.
HERP DERP
4Actually, no, Doom was the first FPS I played
Damn I fell into a hole and right once I landed I was killed :<
4But I prefer Doom II much more
TROTSY LIKE LUNA!
This hardly qualifies as rp, capt_slowpoke, its really more like banter... Silly banter really.
Hey now, don't make fun of the lady.
*hug attacks*
I think Unreal or Quake 2 was my first.
Role-playing? Son of a b*tch, ITS A MINEFIELD IN HERE.
what nmm said
*Avoids metaphorical role-playing mines*
How slow could a slow poke poke if a slow poke could poke slow?
4That means that you played Unreal or Quake 2 at an earlier time than Doom II, which is when you played it around 5
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
I still remember the first time I played Unreal, I got scared at the very beginning :D
3.42 M/s^2

Back.
I played all 3 when I was 5-6
Always helpful.
Maaaay~
(A lot of people don't know I'm kindof a mathlete.)
I mean I could just as easily spam paragraphs into the chatroom, but that might not sit well with those in the room.
That's acceleration not speed.

/me hugs floof
Holy shit math here too
14~
(A lot of people don't know I watch ponies)
2+2=10 in base 4 /sagenod
Yep
That is true
According to deadmau5 4x4=12
oh, right, I did that wrong, sorry. 3.42M/s^-2
When DO you learn about base 10 and all that?
cus it's slowly not quickly and such.
/me wanders off to page Ivan2294's family
base 10 is your standard number counting
I'm only becoming a Highschool senior this fall.
So, I'm wandering when you learn about base 5 and all that stuff.
Also, ZeKeS they all know.
I self studied on the internet.
Play Riven.
You'll learn base five.
I hate Revenants and their damn rockets.
Is there a class for bases in college?
4They wouldn't be so bad if the rockets weren't of homing capacity
baseball
4Which they are
It's called the dormroom
Ivan2294: it's covered as needed
Okay
No there's a class for acids though *symbol roll*
... well played NMM
Yeah I was just killed twice by that damn homing :<
agh that was bad
lol mane_attraction
Clever, very clever
Bazinga
4What's worst is that unless you have a wall of some kind, the rockets will stay on you. They lock on hard
But are you clever enough to outsmart BULLET *Cue Heavy from TF2 firing gun into chatroom*

GTFO GTFO
hahahah
mane_attraction: be nice :?
:/
Why can ponies talk
Oh just throw Rainbow Dash at the guy and he'll squeal and go off to a corner and do.... very vididly detailed and slightly creepy things to her.
This is more then angrily slow, it's brutally aggressive slowness.
Magic.
Luna is into sadomasoquism or sometihng?
omg
How does magic work
Magnets.
with friendship! :D
'Twas playful humour!!!
How does friendship work
Hi LL

Nintendo EAD?
Hello There...

WHY are they cute

WHY do they have four legs
ponies works with magic and nuclear energy u_u
true
Sweet.
Ivan2294: big eyes, childlike proportions
Is the Calvin cycle for photosynthesis? I can't remember :/
Why do they work with magic and nuclear energy?

Ponies are srs bzns.
Ponies are on my resume! (lies)
All I know is that I'M A REBEL, I'M DRIVING BACKWARDS
I on the other hand, fancy in taking life one trot at a time!
AND I don't follow Celestia
celestia is really evil? D:
nor anyone for that matter....
*GASP*
Ivan doesn't play by the rules...
How DARE you disrespect our queen Celestia!
YEAH
I do play by the rules
MY RULES
i dont know D:
You SIR, have your mind in the narrows *lifts chin and trots away*
my brain not works D:
/me yawns
But... you're still here Peaches
Sigh
Hey, I just follow whatever works at the time.
Sigh
Well I only trotted away about a few meters or so
S/he's on a treadmill.
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
It was super effective.
Are you implying that I'm fat?
lol
No.
Never.
*stares down conciously at figure*
hahaha
Uh!
Celestia works right now, but it's not like I will actually listen to her if she commands me to do stuff.
I imply that you create your own energy.
You are green.
I... um... hey, look a sonic rainboom!!!
*whips out Pinky Pie cupcake from bag*
/me looks up
IM NOT FAT
/me watches the argument, amused.
btw I AM fat.
Trust me, gentlemen, you can rest with the assurance that I am fat.
MY FACE HAS A HORN ABOVE IT :O
... and this matters to the world why precisely? :S
Celestia needs to earn my respect.
And hi luna
Direct of Project Freelancer, Dr. Leonard Church.
Of course Luna, you're a unicorn.
Same with most people, although I respect most people by default
Silly fillies
what the
hi Pure_Hatred
We don't need any of your pure hated here, Pure Hatred!
But Celestia lost that respect with the whole over-punish Luna thing.
Ivan2294: right, because someone threatening to kill off all of ponydom should be left alone
RvB reference ftw
TBH Luna got off easily :>
Nope
oh
SIGH
DIFJISDJOF
JAMES BOND!
I don't know, I found the act of tormenting Celestia while in Luna's body was quite fun.
I just think that 1000 years is a little long
wtf hatred
Do you expect me to talk!?
NO! I expect you to watch!
i didnt do that that was nightmare
A little long is an understatement
Sister missed baby Luna? Torment her dreams every night for 1000 years.
Nightmare moon is bi-winning.
/me puts MLP Gen1 on the TV
> implying you're different entities
Oh, Nightmare Moon can go die in an Aperture Science Incinerator for all I care.
No offense
SHUT UP SHUT UP LEAVE ME ALONE NIGHTMARE

6In the middle of the first GET battle of a big tourney.
I like the older Family Guy episodes.
Well Pure_Hatred, when what should've been just a manifestation of one's jealousy, spite, and wrath sudden becomes a physical object after getting blasted by the elements of harmony, anything's possible
She certainly isn't a lady at all!
Especially Stewie.
Why did RD get cut-off?
Pretty,
nice
sensitive
Ugh.
lol
She left in 10 seconds flat
Hi
20% respect left
hi bronette
Just look at the silly little thing, leaving like that!
How ruuuuude!
Hello Bronette?
Respect lost
Damn it. I was going to do a 20% joke. You threw off my groove.
I shall no longer care for you unless it is dangerous to your being.
I just thought this needs to be on this website http://www.zigzagnews.info/3481/lady-gaga-tops-forbes-celebrity-100-list.html aperently Lady Gaga likes MLP.. i belive thats rarity on her necklace
oh silly fillies

Bronette_3, that's rather old news
stupid gag
True
*gaga
Oh really??
*GASPS*
*slaps Luna*
sorry im new to the fandom
She ruins the reputation of us all
lady gaga is the Photo Finish's sister : D
It was reported back in april I believe
I only post when I'm bored or I have a relevant picture :d
ohhh ok
It's okay Bronette.
thanks :)
peaches did mario give up on you or are you still in the castle?
Let's love and tolerate you!
ha
Do want.
*loves and tolerates*
hahahahah
I'll tolerate, but only because I don't really care.
Well, I don't know... weren't you one of his guy pals before you had sex change?
No love for me though
gotta EARN IT
Confound these ponies, they drive me to make a fool out of myself
We spend the most our lives livin' in Celestia's paradise
hahahahahahahahah
............
I've been in the moon being a female for 1000 years, before you were born.
there are no sex changes on the moon.
I beg to differ.
Born in the year 2294, just putting that out there....
Hey, at least you aren't writing a crossover with ponies and an ancient PC RPG.
California Girls came on the radio, and i started singing Equestria Girls without even thinking
thats false
. . . . . .
and the pOrtal's cores?
Oh yeah, Luna did you ever see Wheatley or the space core?
oh! lol!
No, I had to leave him behind.
spaaaaaaace
Probably not, considering they floated into space shortly after appearing on the moon.
She came back before they were sent to the moon.
Why doesn't anyone ever take that into account?
I couldn't focus while he was talking about his father loving space *facepalm*
THEY DIDN'T STAY ON THE MOON, THEY FLOATED AWAY.
hahahahah+
Luna, the moon is cold?
I hate it when people leave them on the moon, Wheatley and Space Core are probably in the asteroid field by now.
Yes, the moon is cold idiot.
Hello everypony
ooooh
D:
Is the moon grey
poor luna
Hi Keideki
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be rude anymore.
D:
DOES THE MOON EXIST
You guys are asking for it.
hahaha
*love*
Luna, at least you walked with MJ. How was it?
i gotta go, Celestia wants me up early tomorrow
Oh wow, the stupid conspiracy theory meme.
*sigh*
see ya
wait me, i need coffee D:
Wow Silly. You win internets. Many, many internets/
Leaving so soon, Luna?
We all know that you were never sent to the moon, Equestria faked it to intimidate the Griffons during the Colt War.
*follows luna to bed*
see you guys later
Yay. I win internets!
wtf
haahha
/me noms internets
Luna's actually a man.
I'll bet.
Dang it, so close to seeing Luna's reaction....
yeah
No sex changes on the moon.
*shoves more of Pinky Pie's cake in mouth*
Humans in my Equestria?
Oh well, it is true what I said.
I thought we already established that.
where did I put those conversion bereaus....
They faked the whole banishment thing.
It's a consipracy D:
Yeah
MAGIC.
yeah!
You can totally see that Nightmare Moon is just a prop.
Ouch.
No she wasn't a prob, she's just an actress
She's a ganger.
An actress skilled at illusions...
yep
She's a ginger?
TWIXIE, DAMN YOU!
Ding?
Oh
Not me
Nevermind
Er, Trixie.
No a ganger *sigh* *facepalm*
The GREAT and POWERFUL TWIXIE?
Darn catchy shipping term.
And they probably just used magic to project the shadow of nightmare moon on the moon
omg
a gangbanger? D:
No!
hahahaaha
Well, horses do roam in mobs... so...
That's just goggledy-goop.
game
of
Luna WAS banished, but just ina dungeon, not on the moon.
thrones
The moon was a dungeon, foal.
Hmmm....
Like I said, the moon banishment is fake.
She went throught the portal to Xen.
Conspiracy during the Colt War
Nah, she was just at Evil Rehab.
Chat, should I watch Star Wars, or work on my fanfic?
Colt War haha
She will return as Gordon Freemane :D
lol
work
See what I did there?
work hardly
Can't let that story get out, these chronic evil problems RUIN politician's careers.
and do a mlp starwars fanfic
=)
Both. Star wars fanfic.
Problem solved.
Nuu. I'm gonna work on my other fanfic.
Use the friendship, Twilight Sparkle.
hahahahahaha
It's super effective
Another piece of evidence, Celestia sent her student to deal with the "threat"
OBJECTION!
If she was a REAL queen she would've taken care of it herself.
OVERULLES
Rainbow Solo.
No it was the summer sun celebration. I win.
Obiwan...Trixie?
Princess Rarity.
i dont understand, if the PRINCESS celestia is just a princess
Whats the EQ IRC here for writers again?
where is the queen? D:
No, no, Celestia is Obi-Wan.
Or the king?
There is no queen you foal.
Also, she has time to do casual things when infact she would have to be way to busy with both the moon and the sun.
No, no...
Wait...
DJMidli: #EquestrianStudy
Queen.
Pure_Hatred sanks
Rule of Princesses dictate that queens are evil
DARTH TRIXIE.
Princess...
Strike her down, she will become more powerful than you can imagine...
Queen. Princess.
princesses are cuter anyway
WTF
QUEEN IT UP B*TCH
Krizak you win internets.
... what. the fuck.
Which is bad, because I've read some of these fanfics and man, people can imagine her pretty darn powerful.
http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/pegs_and_holes/has
PG
i think
celestia is like hana from doremi
she has nigh-infinite power
the answer is simple..
Her powerlevel is >9000.
FROM THE UNITED KING
Scott Adams (Yes, SCOTT ADAMS!) basically just said that it's not your fault if you rape someone
12bbl
IDEA
I'M LOOKING FOR HIM
princess can have sex with everypony, but queens only with her kings
:D
it's *society's* fault for not liking rape.
I'M GOING TO CALIFORNIA
</random>
I like the idea of calling out Celestia as a fake, she is the ruler but she is a princess? SHE'S JUST A GREAT BIG PHONY
i read that as a great big pony
I see nigh-infinite power, and now I'm thinking somehow of Haruhi/FIM crossover.
I can attest to sister being a great big pony.
Why are all teh RP accounts name *character*0
That would be the mosh pit of Fanfic.
wait
(Haruhi watches FIM, Kyon is now suddenly a pony.)
I said phony
the names are taken
i have a question for everypony
anyone read fanfics?
Wha?
=(
Yes.
I do.
HELLO WORLD
I hate fanfics
i cant =(
Ivan2294: because people already have i.e. Trixie regged here
beware I live
oh hi
Sup trixie, still don't like you, no offense ^_^
Why can't you read fanfics?
im so stupid
I leave such good impressions on people...
I was surprised Nightmare_Moon wasn't regged.
and i cant understand english very well
Since the proper name has a space in it and such
I bet NightmareMoon is registered.
(i speak spanish ^^U)
whats up
Nightmare_Moon: yep. That's why I have God_Empress_Celestia, since PC was regged
Wait, why are you wasting your time being only slightly "evil" in a chatroom....
not much
Ivan2294: affably evil :p
you?
You aren't stupid.
bored and emoing out on vegas along with looking at old projects
hahaha
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeelp I'm gonna go.
Nightmare is affably evil, I'm saddened that it hasn't been noticed and put up on Tvtropes..
I'm assuming affably evil means, not very evil or good at being evil, or something along those lines...
No, it means being nice while being evil.
She's nice?
Since when?
evil fail
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil
also this penguin game on neopets is awesome
No, Nightmare Moon isn't affably evil, despite what she's saying.
Evil: I'm going to stop the sun. Not evil: I will throw very unthreatening roadblocks in your path on the way to challenge me and unnlock your true potential

14EXCALIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR
14:'D
4It's just me and Sprinkles. Dari is in sleep mode
4Everything is as it should be
I also imagine that now that she's separate from luna, it's an internal discussion more like "I can run around and be EVVVVILLLL or I can veg out in front of my PC and chat with ppl ... screw it I ain't doin crap today"
what game?
the ad one?
Of course, she's also INCREDIBLY manipulative - just ask Luna - so who knows :P
yeah
hahahahahahah
Elements of Harmony? Instant Villian decay
Sleep mode because it's 5 AM.
lol
it's farily easy and I'm getting 1000 np a game so
4*gasp*
!may
Attention all of Equestria, i love fluttershy
4Why are you posting if you are in sleep mode, sir?
that is all
Becuase I just woke up. :P
Yeah brohoof!!!
That explains why the worst thing she did is turn into a thorn to agitate a manticorn
Also peadges are feeding on the grassy patch outside my bedroom window again
Flutterstare: *koyaanisqatsi*
everypony loves fluttershy u_u
WHAT A LOSER

That stare, that posture, elegant!
Rape face.
4...what am I looking at exactly?
the Nyan cat thing

That gives you nightmares? You better not run into Slasherbloom in a dark alley then.
No not really
...omg
The progress bar on the video.
What about Pinkamina?
4Ohhhh, I had to pop out
should i get coffee and work on fanfiction or should i go to bed and dream about ponies
6Where the popup comes up.
He reminds me of that one guy who likes stabbing.
6Or what?
Flutterstare: dream about ponies :3
Dreaming about ponies is fun.
but it's mlp fanfiction!
But whenever I see that picture I get the feeling that if I make the slightest move that gives the wrong impression I will immediattley be pounced on.
oh god
I don't like being attacked by ponies.
Flutterstare: write about something or LIVE something?
Youtube can have everything I own.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/1827 You've been dealt a terrible fate, haven't you?
Because I can die happy now.
Because you will be.
oh, you're right
wait
That is so cool.
i can do both
6...what's the big deal, exactly?
/me is afraid to click on that link....
6Am I just not seeing it?

Ivan2294: applebloom w/ a slasher smile

Hey, did you know that desktop ponies has sound now?

ITS SO ANNOYING

4That's pretty neat
slasherbloom looks like a snake in this pic
hahaha
I will see that image during my sleep... and I will sleep better :)
4I saw a red-eyed black and white peadge the other day, she was beautiful!
4...where did this craze come from? *off to KYM*
Slasherbloom protected my desktop from all the humans, she was very good at her job.
0.0
I got to go to sleep...night bronies.
Night@
Night inigo
lol
gnight

don't worry
Wait...

So, hows everypon doing tonight?
Bored....
Restlessly amused
Doing Swell!
horrible cause i didnt get a job i went for today Mongoose how about you?
Bored? I'm enjoying myself quite nicely, thankyou.
Me too.
Good, Had an easy day.
i once had a dream with ponys
=(
so did I.
How was the dream?
er...
I had one, a lucid dream. Fun one at that.
Uh..
GTFO remember this is PG!!
;)
... mane_attraction he hadn't SAID anythig :S
yeah id say my dream but this chat is PG...
I honestly don't know why I'm wasting my time talking to an affably evil pony and some bronies instead of buying X-Com: UFO Defense....
err
Ivan2294: you should go play X-COM
a bad dream with ponies
=(
...it was more humour. Sorry. *Hangs head in shame*
Aww, how bad?
~has the version from the PC Gamer oldgames CD~
I want to, but I can't move away.....
did one of ponies..hurt you?
mane_attraction: sorry, I'm a bit jumpy with some things :S
Ivan2294: DOO ITT
I CAN'T
I'll help you move away :3
Does it break PG by any chance..?
NO WAIT
Awww think nothing of it.
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING ON DOING?
in the dream, I had sex with twilight
=(
Ooo
...
Ivan2294: a kick and a temp ban
It's because I love nyan cat.
really
Hahah. Irony.
in b4kick
NO
=(
Ivan2294: long enough for you to get started in X-COM
DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!
this nite
:<
My mom is a sleep anyways!
But I thought you WANTED xcom
GTFO this chat is PG nagger ;-;
Um...
I can't buy it right now...
D:
o
sry!
Unless she ISN'T ASLEEP...
Dx
Long enough to FINISH X-COM.
*RUNS*
/me is frozen in time
GTFO join #equestriaafterdark for XXX stuff
It appears I can predict the future.
/me is afk
Long enough to earn the money to buy X-COM and then play X-COM!
my favorite piece of dialogue in the whole season is the one about fluttershy being a tree
sorry
^^U
/me hugs GTFO
GTFO dont apologize to me silly, apologise to ZekeS, Ali1017 , Blazing-Fury and the mods
6I am going to KILL Lunar Topaz.
Portal
=(
The point's been made, let's move on
It's okay GTFO. Poines are important to us... in... different ways.
nope, she isn't awake
.
.
.
No use grinding him deeper into the dirt
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
RAGE
(^.^)b ZekeS
._.
somehow I'm not surprised youtube did that
but
..
...
oh.. forget this -.-U
GTFO dont worry, we're bronies. we love you regardless <3
4Whoa, Sprinks, what's wrong?
I admit I was shocked when I saw it
Run!
love and tolerance and fluttershies
it caught me off guard
So, anyways last time I checked I had just stopped caring about GTFOs dream.
ditto
/me night do a music broadcast shortly o3o
I once dream I was in ponyville, but I couldn't find the library for the life of me. Then I woke up
I saw a screenshot of it first
Yeah, no.
might*
what's this about my true love?
I swore they were trolling
I had a dream that lyra was tony montana
wne to the video
No one mare should have all dat powwaaaaaaah
and I was watching scarface
*went
Um...
problems ponies?
Nope, not trolling
the clock's tickin' i just count the houuuuurs
I wish I had a dream about.....well anything really, I rarely remember any of them...
6He purposely left the GET battle when I was winning to go to sleep, saying that we'd continue tomorrow.
no problem here sir.
6Knowing full well that I have to stream tomorrow.
i LOVE the pony anthology
My dream was a normal dream, until twilight showed up and started taking notes about me..i woke up in a cold sweat.
6I'm not going to be able to GET at all.
i had a dream where Spike sang "Do For Love" by Tupac to rarity...
I think I had one about DiRT 3 though....I think it was just racing though....
Why?
MY DREAMS ARE BORING...
I had a vivid dream on an island vacation spot, tanning with Twilight. Cool stuff, we swam in the waters around the islet, Pinkie hopped on the Vienne rooftops, etc.
i had a dream about Psycho Pie
I dream about Inception... wait...
lol
i had a dream where i was in the Animus
:(
but it was dead
the whole time
I've probably dreamt about ponies at some point, but I don't remember anything aside form the fact that I may have had a dream about ponies....
haha
Did you poke it?
i dont know why i had that dream =(
let me tell you a story, it's called the ugly barnacle.
an evil enchantress?
Don't worry man, I once had a lucid dream about Zombies, and what did I do? Spawn more zombies....
I had a dream with ponies... unfortunately it was a nightmare I got ran over by a train.
once there was a barnacle who was SO ugly that everyone died.
the end
Nightmare_Moon: what.
I LIKE TRAINS
noooooooooooooooooooooo
*train horn*
Nightmare moon had a nightmare... impossible.
*beeeeeeeeeeep*
6To be fair, I did accept the battle knowing full well there are a couple saged threads on /oat/
die potato
I had a dream of of Modern Warfare 3 and MLP
I'd like to dream about ponies. But I rarely remember ANYTHING
6Which interferes with his GET style, but not mine.
After you got hit by the train did you wake up???
is that normal?
ANY. THING.
nightmare moon haves nightmares.. in the moon? o.O
Yes mane_attraction, I did
I once had a dream where I hit /mode +b *!*@* then kicked everyone from this channel
felt good man
i remember i woke up in the london clock tower
:o
Nightmare. Do you have nightmares about yourself?
Good because that would have been a painful dream.
no, don't!
then Rainbow dash said "come on stand up!"
I once had a dream about banjo-kazooie
And you stood up!
Hello flutterstare
It was boring...
hi Kiniest
I don't love you
Because you do what Rainbow dash says. Damn strait.
welll
One time though, I had a dream that I fell out of a rollercoaster during a loop, through a tree and landing on solid concrete 3 stories down, cracking it. Got up and walked it off like nothing.
why?
I don't love you
im going to bed
then i grabbed a MP-40
I had lucid dream that involved Snake and Rainbow dash
and started shooting ultranationalist ponies
i love you all
why not, Kiniest?
it was awesome.
We love you top GTFO
bye! see you later bronies
Because I don't, Fluttershy
Mongoose GO ON
/me *hugs*
but i love you...
I once had a dream that was a mixture between Digimon, Gmod, and something else....don't remember much...
Bye!
thx sillynilly
Or maybe we should continue this in EAD since you know... lucid dreams....
i have the feeling
Can go any farther, PG
See ya GTFO!
I'm not going to love you.
LOL
i will dream about Metro Last Light and MLP
Have a good night!
I knew it Mongoose
lol Jazza
seeyou yo
*to
*too
Kiniest, you're going to make me cry
You couldn't resist
What?
FUUUUUUUU bad english Dx
:P
If I do dream about MLP it will probably be boring. Very. Very. Boring. *hangs head*
and then i will be angry
You couldn't resist not having it PG
well i gotta get going
See you tomorrow everypony
you're... going to LOVE ME!!!!
See ya!
bye!
N...No?
I'm going to hit the sack too.
Lol Win
4Lunar has been known to cower out of battles when she's losing
/me applies a strategic censor beep to Flutterstare's phrase
how do i make crossed text?
4She's pretty much a bitch, but I like her anyways
Goodnight everypony.
Kiniest hates me
night
Flutterstare: you don't
Night Mane_attraction!
I don't loe you
....maybe the main reason why I don't dream about ponies is that I try to avoid that....(facepalm)
Your only my second favorite
4>implies that girls go to Ponychan
eww these dries apricots have sulfur dioxide in them
you should embrace it bro
i don't? what? what don'
is this safe for consumption?
t i do
Remember guys
If you are wondering why, it's because it will probably end badly.
FEAR THE FUTURE
I love Pinky more.
In Celestia we (don't) trust
Nah, the future is pretty boring dude
i'm... one of your favorites?
Your a second
*big breath* yay
I only love Pinky though
I don't love you
/me now belongs to Hooh54 for 11 minutes
I once daydreamed that Twilight handed me a pencil using unicorn magic. And then I was holding a pencil.
;o
i love pinkie
Besides, I read an alternate ending where you wrote Cupcakes
4I have captured you >:3
but fluttershy will always be my favorite
Basically, North Korea is in shambles after Zombies, Ponies are in G21 now, and I'm surprised hasbro has survived so long.
Future in a nutshell
Fluttershy, did YOU write Cupcakes?
hasbro will rule the world
no, i didn't
nooooooooo
i've only read about half of it
Silly Ivan2294, everypony knows the Zombie Ponies will start in Russia
4Huh, and Circuitfry is taunting you it seems
hah
then it started talking about adrenaline torture
www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mp9rhtudaE
!space
and i stopped
They did try with G4, but Canada did NOT approve.
4This is the first time /me has gone in a GET thread
;0;
oh wells
*I'm talking to the In character Flutter xD*
Also, there were Zombie Ponies in Russia
/me Now Playing: Scud Race - Groovin' Daylight
Wait, and here I thought the 2294 bit was just random numbers.
But it ended quickly
Our ponies aren't nearly as powerful as Equestrian ones.
oh
lol
RP is alwasy nice
And before you ask, no Equestria has yet to be contacted.
Let's try that again, from the top.
okay
In the year 2552 Celestia makes herself known to the world along with Luna, to open Conversion Bereaus around the world and begin widespread ponification.
Fluttershy, did YOU write cupcakes?!
Yeah, you would have been screwed if it had been, y'know, zombie full-size horses.
no, um... no, i didn't
Nah, I'd be dead before that happens
and ponies would be forgotten by then
Well, considering I was only in the 2290s I don't really care now do I ...
I will say this, bronies still exist.
but um... i did read it...
Excuse, me what?!
Ok, comma fail
>_>
woo, smrpg beat
and it scared me...
... I am going to go back in time
And they did succed in taking over hawaii
And delete Cupcakes from existence
Man if I live to see 2290s I expect Star Trek type goings on
Fluttershy, what did you say?!
[23:22:40] <Nightmare_Moon> In the year 2552 Celestia makes herself known to the world along with Luna, to open Conversion Bereaus around the world and begin widespread ponification.
this is my fetish
I can't remember what the last grimdark fanfic I read....
i um... i'm sorry for not being clear earlier...
www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mp9rhtudaE
what i meant was, um...
no, i did not write um, cupcakes
that's about as likely as a hole in reality being made, PsychicKid
you'd best be off
/me gives ZekeS a DeLorean to aid in his efforts
oh it's ok
once i pass from this world into the next, all kinds of crazy stuff will happen
anyway, fluttershy is best pony
Nope, basically the only thing that has happened is railguns on battleships, North Korean Zombie outbreak, and fail'd brony attempt at a hostile hawaiin take over, other than that nothing has happened.
lmao
hey is any one active here, I forgot what movies are playing tomorrow
6We're here.
wut
You need to pinch up on Fluttershy a bit, you know she'd be utterly scarred from reading it. But good job so far.
lol i don't RP
I'm more of a non-canon RP'er.
6It's The Best Night Ever, Aladdin, Dragonshy, and Starship Troopers tomorrow.
I know
But I force people
x3
Fluttershy's got a dark side though
6Make sure to sign up for our email notifications.
It comes out when she feels unloved.
Hmm, I wonder if Gilda's been regged yet. of course I can't play both Gilda and Nightmare, that would be selfish of me.
Have humans made interdimensional contact with Equestrian ponies Ivan2294?
6Just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com asking to sign up. It'll really help keep you in the know.
NO
you fail
Aww..
My world religions teacher was just like fluttershy
Don't make her angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry
We don't have that technology yet.
Drat.
D;
how?
You know she'd do this: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkr2247SBp1qg41mt.gif
sweet, kind, caring
When?! *raises arms in disbelief*
but all that was a cloak over his insanity brewing within
Closest we have gotten is inter-dimensional contact with the Halo and Mario Universes, but those aren't important.
lololol
yo
wat
Apparently so. No one wants dictator turtles and the Flood rampaging around our realm.
^
or anything for that matter
we'd lose no matter what
so, have you guys heard of this show, "My little pony: friendship is magic"?
there are a lot of reasons
go on
OHSOCOOL
apparently, it's pretty good
*scratches head* No I haven't. What's it about?
You don't say
What happens?
4I got Dawn of the Dragon today
6Anything else you need?
it's about these six friends
who gain unnatural powers
You see the way interdimensional travel works is like stacking a piece of paper. We are on one paper, and the other dimensions are on other ones. It's easy enough to puncture throught two or three "papers" but the Equestrian paper is 129 dimensions away, and the farthest we've gotten is 23
and defeat evil
Is their friendship magic?
well, You fail too
no, i think it is quite plutonix
plutonic*
you break the fabric of reality
Also, ponies? Whatareyouguysgay.jpg
you break the fucking everything ever
Many, many layers.. How long until we reach their dimension?
you fail more ;p
So you're screwed
Nonsense, you mean "Realities". And traveling through them is much like stabbing someone with a soap bubble. Possible, but difficult
Hmm....long time.
*strokes chin* Oh well.
THE FABRIC OF EXISTENCE ITSELF WILL TEARRRRR
everyone loves pinkie
Shoggoth, the physics of a dimension also apply to any objects FROM that dimension
NO U
So we have our own type of dimensional travel, while others have their own.
Hallo
at least i dont break bots ;x
AKA, they have a chance of contacting US before we get to them.
has there been an mlp/call of cthulhu crossover yet?
If pinkie were say blue, would her name still be pinkie?
that's because you're not skilled enough to have any
blue pie?'
Technically yes
Oh yeah, Pinkie is apparently the Equestrian ambassador, seeing as she has fourth wall breakage powers.
:P
because colors are only how we percieve reality
links, please
Still, Dimensions are more appropriately reserved for the X,Y,Z planes and the T plane
Blueberry Pie
so in the end
maybe we are the ponies
I dont need a bot
we just percieve ourselves as people
bots are a waste of space
AHAHAHHAHA
I like Blueberry Pie
AAHAHAHAHHAH
but we were already dead
So we won't have to wait the standard 2 hundred thousand years to be able to get to Equestria
What a twist
/me snaps
bah
bots can be interesting once you learn how to make one and use it
Interesting..
Anyone her knows "OhYeaPinkiePie" ?
here*
studies show that every time a statistic is made up, someone dies
We did get a note in a bottle a while back in the year 2012. Something about a prank a certain doctor pulled with some people called the mays or something...
So you just murdered someone?
0399999999999999999999999999999999
oh jeez
i suppose i did
Sneas :3
whoopsee
Really?
You should be ashamed
i do that 20% more often then i should
s'okay
After all this time?
75% of all statistics are lies
opps, ther's another one
no
thats just a percentage
100% of all statistics are made up on the spot
oh
statistics are similar, but somewhat different
FACT
*Citation Needed*
What is saying that something dies when something happens a statistic or fact? Because if it's just a fact you never killed anyone.
20% of all statistics are cooler when the variables include RBD. This is FACT.
[Original research?]
FACT: pinkie pie is adorable
FACT: I AM CRAZY.
FACT: fluttershy is adorable
[questions articles neutrality]
oh thank you sorry I looked away, I actually found the Pony chan thread, but thanks, oh also can you explain the lottery thing I'd like to enter this week
therefore, fluttershy=pinkie pie
Solly, Pinkie is not really adorable in the conventional sense, she is just using perception filters on you all!
FACT: the word "fact" sounds funny when you say it over and over
i heard mlp wat
/me runs
[citation needed]
Silly*
wb, kiniest
>_>
I know something that you guys will like though from the future. They finally released Episode 3
DCed
So bad
I had to
Restart my computer
Ponies
*squeals*
did you survive?
That stacking was on purpose btw
ponies ponies pony pony pony pony ponyponyponyponyponyponyponyponypony
There was no time
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
POOOOOOONIES
No, Fluttershare, I entered the world of cupcakes and tried to run away
Suprisingly, I ended up here
oh my goodness
They finally announced the release date right when I accidently the space time continuuem
Pny where?
Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie is out there
What does the future hold for Episode 3?
6There's a thread to enter in, one sec, I have the link...
everyone dies
The end of the world is truly nye
Rocks fall?
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35769661.html
neigh*
the end of the world is truly neigh*
6During the intermission, I'll stream the lottery live.
Idk it isn't out yet, I just assumed they really were going to release it that year like they said they would.
:{Recalibrating Inter D perception filters >}
6The chat will be muted.
how does the world end? A giant rock?
No, world hasn't ended yet.
No, the world doesn't end
6The people who are picked will be given voice so they can speak without being harrassed.
It is built of sturdy stuff
Although we know how it will.
it goes on FOREVER
The only characters I've ever been decent at roleplaying were Dokuro-chan and Maya Fey
Now YOU on the other hand
well, yeah.
6And that's how we're picking movies from now on.
It will be Pinkie Pie
yes I re call that part
The bronies on earth are building an orbital friendship cannon
She will end it
omg Maya Fey? isn't she from ace attorney?
Yes
6Okay.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bQnh9kVKhw
there is something about a code
Predictions say it will misfire and destroy earth
i love that game
I will PONY
I can do a decent maya fey
and my email
6A code?
PONY PONY
Death by friendship
Was anybody from Canada present at those riots today?
Reminds me of this: Want to destroy the Earth? Here are some tips.. http://qntm.org/destroy
This is why only the bronies are on earth
BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
6Oh, you don't have a tripcode.
Wow, Nick! I didn't know ponies could talk!
6A tripcode is basically a password that lets everypony know you're you.
Hey, nick, I just beat the world score on
Oh yeah, that's another big thing. We all live in space now, only bronies live on earth....
Touhou for the second time today!
6It's typed like name#tripcode
NEED PONIES
What that chart failed to take into consideration was the possibility of severing the planet through temporal variance
NEED MORE PONIES
6>>; stupid chat made it a link. XD
omg maya fey hello
PONIES
...Nick, it hurts... They're.... canceling Steel Samurai...
Oh, new song yay!
PONIES
still kind of confused on that
They believe that someone named Pinkie Pie will save them once their friendship beam fires and destroys the planet, but I think that's a bunch of hooey.
i agree with rust
/me is gibbering incoherently about ponies
Rust: ...
6Okay... what would you want it to say after your name?
Finish him! B, B, D, HK: FRIENDSHIP
You're incoherently gibbering EVERY NIGHT.
I know
6Maybe I can get you a tripcode real quick.
LOOK @ DIS FOTOGRAFF
Can you come up with a new schtick? :p
it's what happens every night
/me sees Pearls transform into Mia
well there's the whiny, mopey me...

Sure.
I learned that being stabbed is not as much fun....
Beware! OVERUSED MEMES
Ah thank you. The evil enchantress had me in her gaze.
Well, I think I've gotten in kind of a rut, sticking to to same kind of stuff I've been doing for years

Fireant word on the streets says you are about to drop a clopfic
But MLP reminded me that I can still be surprised by new things

13Near the end of the video, some people are seen walking past a young man. He said something quite rude
4well truth be told i know a lot about my fellow wiki users
Maximum strangeness.
*wiping soda off my keyboard
13The other man, just before that scene said "Nice"

The glass vase has feelings?
I appear to have missed my medication at some point

Oh, really? I am allergic to crying.
It happens.
I have feelings... *cries*

Don't cry. You'll make me feel sad.
But...

Uhg, that foal's gonna cry all night, there went my peace.

/me hugs FlutterCry
So is there a reason blogger clears all ratings seemingly randomly?
People still make those?
lolyes
(@GreenGenie, be careful not to use WMM)
noone ever answeres my question
I stopped watching those after Walrusguy got suspended.
My fanfic was stolen *cries*

http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Poop
how so FlutterCry?
Probabluy
(@Klondlike cs188 is good)
Well...
I find it interesting that the French Wikipedia has articles on things that have been deleted from the English Wikipedia
nightmare moon...it's a pun without even trying :o
SOmeone steal his idea.
Dash came to my house...
Looked at it.

...Threw up, said that it was sickening and she couldn't eat cupcakes again...
howdy
cool
....And burned it.
*cries*
That's terrible!
God I can't believe I didn't know for all these years that Zazu from The Lion King was voiced by Rowan Atkinson
horse meat doesn't even taste good as cupcakes
And now she won't ever talk to me or Pinkie Pie again!
*cries*
lol yeah that's rowan
I am jacks sence of utter anoyment
Oh wait, she's crying to misery...
Ah, the sultry serenade...
13What'd you think of Sunny Flight, DSD?
Mmmm... cupcakes.
if lauren faust redid the hole sea ponies and let them have cutie marks, what do you think they would look like? would they look like the originals at all? :o
moon leave luna alone! LEEVERALONE
btw faust wouldn't be doing it anymore, she left remember?

Seaponies.
*cries*
You can gouge your eyes out now.
they're like loo loo we've got fins and shit
And my wife, Rarity left me....
* Now runing around a rock*
If you could travel into the past 100 years and bring only one item with you from the future, what would it be?
13About the ending with Tron? I put him in because I just defeated Sark and the MCP hours ago at the time.
For a draaaaagogogonnnnn!
*cries*
to be frank, it took some gettign used to, but seaponies are ok in that song.
4Nice
omg is it spike?
Good gravy.
Wow, listening to Wipeout HD ost with Sea Ponies is trippy.
...oh, wow, I'd heard of the seaponies before, but I'd never seen them before.
John316, simple, a Gatlin Gun used in Shogun Wars
13This was done three months ago
KILL IT WITH FIRE!
And now I will see them again... in my nightmares.
4Space_core Spacespacehelpspacespacespace
13?
SHOO-BE-DOO! SHOO-SHOO-BE-DOO!
/me who wants some muffins?
Seaponies will be main characters in season 2.
4It's Spactin
that's baller btw
4For him to get over here and chat
how does it do that thing where it makes my name bold with noise?
13He does not normally appear alongside FFXII characters
Hm...
If someone use your name it highlight you
Seaponies would make a good fanfic story arc.
I got me some Costco muffins.
If someone refers to you by name, your name will bold. I think.
Oh.
Derpy <3 costco so much
4Dotd time
Just notch it up to a Twilight spell
mhmm, example, SillyNilly :D
4Ping if needed
Or use OC ponies, alternatively.
I got a chicken bake and a huge thing of beer
What if I use my own name, John316
13This has only happened once before: Misty Bog (ブロークン パレス)
Yes Ossala that is correct!
nope
What would happen if Twilight read Twilight?
she's die
and explode
She would get stupid horny and paranoid
then implode
Then explode again
Can you do that?
And then she exploded... twice.
Twilight would never read such drivel.
and then turn into derpy
/me joins team Sparkle
YOu...
She would start fantasizing about rarity being a vampire
ArE.... GoINg tO LOVE MEEEEEE!
13The same with Ratchet and Clank: They never appeared alongside FFXII characters
>_>
/me joins team Catherine
Oh wai wrong game
all like "Let's have make outs, rarity omg our horns are touchiiinnggg"
13The man that said "Nice" in ISFH is the main reason why these restrictions are on
"Spike, set this book on fire." "You want to send it to the Princess?" "No, no, your REGULAR fire. I'm not one for book burning, but some things need to be purged by fire!"
/me hides under the covers
Whoa whoa whoa... whoa... I don't even.
Derpy..
4Who is he?
SSSSSSSPAAAAAAAACCCCee
Think about it
Derpy. You're reminding me of this really disturbing fanfic. Please stop.
rarity's really pale
ohai Aurora
13The man that said "Nice"?
Hm
classic vamp look
btw which fanfic?
4Yes
The one where Twi finds Rarity's romance novel?
4Also i have my comp right near my TV
YoU.... aLl lOVe mE... RiGHT?!
Yes Flutter, we love you.
We love you Flutterrage
YES MA'AM MS FLUTTERRAGE
13I'm going to give you a hint on his name: Sounds French'
...
timmy?
Our love for you is like the power of a thousand suns and a white dwarf.
/me produces a glass of warm milk and hands it to Flutterage *here take this to calm down*
4Hope
Let's talk about stuff that makes us happy
4There is always hope
I love my snuggly wuggly bed
Yay.
and my darling honey muffin
4Man does this hit my heart
13Not hope
I wrote two songs today.
I've never understood the supposed soothing powers of warm milk.
sick brah
Honey muffins? Do they taste good?
13But quite hansom, he is
Warm milk is bleh to me. I need my milk ice cold.
/me 4is in DOTN
Oh, that's what I call my darling dear muffin dinky
13He and his teammates are the main characters in FFXII
idk if honey muffins are good
I'll only drink it warm if there is hot cocoa added to it.
probably!
*runing on water*
13He's got a wikipedia article
muffins are good by default
btw klondike, you a muso?
4Wait Vaan
So... what do you think I'm made of?
13Very Close: Balthier
I'm a muso myself, hence the "Grooves" corruption in my namblo
Fluff, love and kindness
Somewhat.
doh
13The Sky Pirate Balthier has the same Japanese voice actor as Hunter the Cheetah!
4Hunter is epic looking
^ O.O
I MEAN SUNSHINE
Studying, books
13He is!
o.o
*.*
and especially math
/me was neer seven alive again, and found dead by suicide
/me weeps
So Klondike, is your music pony-based?
4Sparx is not here Spyro it's grublin
/me NUUUUU
No.
That's cool
13Where is Sparx?
I just write whatever comes to mind.
Just a heads up, tho. I did ONE half-assed pony remix and it got more views than any of my other music ever
4Hunter has him
I'm hoping to get my stuff recorded and maybe post them on youtube.
13Okay!
DerpyGrooves: ... that's kinda depressing actually
4Uxie we need all of the buttons listed and what they do
like combined lol
right? :D
Did you at least get a similar spike on your other music, albeit smaller?
13That's right!
You don't mind if you link it DerpyGrooves?
I would like to hear the remix.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VloitOL-A0I
I give myself a 4/10 for making funny jokes but not maintaining character
4If you could start a template on all of the spyro games i could add
4The core games
I've deliberately kept my traditional tunes and the pony stuff seperate
4Not the gba's
yeah that was nice play kin
Btw any brass players in here?
That's pretty good Derpy.
13We've got a template. Check the game article pages
I just need to study the character.
4Spyro does a barrel roll :O
13Okay
Thanks a ton, bro ^^ I actually just got my DJ controller this week, so I was excited to try it out
/me once played the euphonium
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3tPqCJyJCk
Yo john, do you think it would be retarded for me to think I can teach myself trumpet?
4Oh god somethings behind them we they fight
I don't
btw klondike that is so cute
even tho im not jon
oH SNAP
DerpyGrooves what controller
Trumpets are cool.
lol
Remember, if you're going to RP Pinkie, make sure you're drunk.
4Ugly lava bird
And ignore the 4th wall
People can learn whatever on their own. Its just easier to avoid bad habits if someone teaches you what they are
Oh btw it's a numark mixtrack
I got it for 100$ and tbh the platters are on par with my stepbro's 3000$ CDJ setup
And try to act like Rena Ryuuguu every now and then
doubtful. its Numark.
No, if you really want to RP Pinkie, consume a boatload of sugar. Sorry if you are diabetic..
13Once I deal with an upcoming double boss, I'm going to be very active at the wiki!
Yeah def. I've read brass instruments are really anal about proper technique
and if hes got a 3k setup is probably pioneer.
As in, if you don't do it right, your embeauchoure can be ruined forever
Pioneer never EVER will be on par with Numark.
If you try to roleplay me, act stupid.
yeah it's crazy. I mean, it's cool, but it's an insane load of crap when I have sort of the same capability for way cheaper
I finished the dubstep, I liked it.
DerpyGrooves: yes.
+with the visual aspect of a laptop
but regardless the numark mixtrack is okay ^^
4Cool
4Cynder=win
Especially the trumpet is easy to screw up :P
I still need to get an audio interface
(besides, low brass >>>>>>> silly trumpets)
but DJ-IOs are like 30$ so it's really cheap
If you need to be drunk to play that lunatic in character, you're doing something wrong. Pinkie is cocaine + caffiene on an endless sugar rush with this crazed bit of genius that makes her Pinkie
Check out my sparkles
I need a new mic.
double?
All the chicks dig it
Same here
g2g
Bye John
I'll get a trumpet, but I'll get in touch with some of the old jazz cats in my town
/me shudders
so long john
By bible reference.
*bye*
DerpyGrooves i just got an all in one the Hercules DJ Console Mk4, has the audio interface built in
I really want to make some trip-hop pony stuff
13I'm in Space Paranoids in KHII, and there will be a double boss battle coming up soon
Yeah I was looking into that, but I think the numark is just easier to interface
How about Pony metal?
*Cries*
best platters for the price point, too
DerpyGrooves but the good thing about the DJ-IO is you can use it on some of the older and better controllers
does the hercules have touch-sense platters?
Kiniest: I'm sorry but even PURE_HATRED has standards :<
First way to get kicked: Joke about twilight.
yeah def. :3
DerpyGrooves their higher end yes. the one I have no, but I don't scratch so i didn't need it.
yeah I'm working on my scratch chops
Kiniest: you became ... Edward ...
How can ponies do metal? You can't throw up the horns with a hoof.
you ... ou.
AHHH THIS STUFF IS REALLY FRESH
/me dissolves
4Wait
i lost the game, srry
4Hunter kills the damn thing in one hit?
/me curls into a little whimpering RainbowDash-esque morass
4God they suck
(And before you say it, unicorns have a horn. Singular. They can not throw up the horns.)
I'm really glad I chose the numark over the behringer BCD
I'm going to become edward now
/me pets zZz ekeS
wut u did ther
i c it
Touche.
omg our horns are touchhiiinnnggg
DerpyGrooves ah yeah then for the pricepoint the mixtrack was your best bet.
DerpyGrooves: *trixie+omgluna.jpg*
I feel like I wish I had a brother all of a sudden.
13A cutscene in KHII shows Sora, Donald and Goofy kill three Dusks in just one hit each. Kinda unfair, it seems
So what do you spin, brony?
I tried hard to have a father, but instead I have a dad.
Like, music?
And then, and then, he becomes a suit of armor
And then he slaps me by episode 25
DerpyGrooves J-euro/Eurobeat/J-core anything that goes down at an anime convention which is where i mostly spin at.
...*cries8
4Hunters cooler
I can do hardcore/HHUK pretty good too
Nice.
Honestly, that was like 24 episodes too late for that slap.
...
I give myself a 2/10
I got so much stupid miku shit when I was in japan
I have a friend who DJ's at a local club.
btw hardcore is baller
lol it's so cheesy but it's fun
13True
yeah I hear you
cause theres a local cosplayer who ruined it for everyone by believing she was the reincarnation of it...
lol
and her craziness kinda ruined it.
Japan loves dat Miku
and by believe. I mean..she honestly believed she was the phsycial reincarnation
There's seriously people like that? lol wow.
eyyup
13But I will always love the "You're Doomed/You're Still Doomed" sidequest in the third game!
There's people like me.
Think about it
I have a twelve string.
Think about it.
I've got a fuckload of enka tapes my grandpa gave me
I have a name.
Think about it.
It's all this weird old japanese conway twitty crap
I have exploding lemons.
but it's fun to remix, you know
Think about it.
I LOVE digging through the vinyl crates @ the local goodwill
anyways http://fav.me/d3cop5u thats a picture of me DJing live at G-anime with a bouncer looking over my shoulder lol. I'm finding the mix right now.
I'm worried the mods are getting annoyed.
Think about it
nice look man
Get this
Cool bro.
I was at goodwill a couple days ago
Cool story, brony
4Rare
4Hes Rare
Found a mint condition vinyl copy of Carla Bley's Escalator over the hill for 3$
DerpyGrooves and anypony else: DJ Midli Live @ G-anime: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=V80ZM7TF
I was just there today dropping off some stuff.
I'm selling it on ebay for 45$
NO PEARLS
I WISH our goodwill still carried vinyl
4is Cynder a purple dragon?
its all cd, and no techno gems
Mods are trying to purge Edward Cullen from their brain before sleeping, post ponies
I need to get one of those USB turntables+direct drive too
say what there?
Just get serato scratch.
... I think I missed my window of opportunity.
nn
13No
4What is she?
13I think she is black
13Even the wiki makes comment of her color
lol you can run serato w. a usb turntable and a control vinyl, yeah?
and traktor and mixx and everything
4Wll in game she looks purple as do her wings
4*well
Zeke
aye.
I'm going to do something that might make you kick me really hard
If not temporarily ban me
Kiniest: ... I knew I should have closed my SSH client
What :3
But seriously do you think bronies would dig a MLP rap?
yes
because they already have
FRIDAY!
GO
...
lol this mixx is hilarious already
I want to see this.
It didn't work?
You should get some AKB48
Darn
Spike can be the 13-year-old driving.
isn't there already an MLP rap/\?
LU
That was THE BAND back when I was in japan
Use the carriage scene from the last episode.
ohai
hai
BAGEL! BAGEL! BAGEL! OOOOOH!
ON THE TOPIC OF FRIDAY and DJing.. especially with serato scratch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoMhOKagWNU&feature=related
I just can't believe my first love will be a...
BAGEL!
ohai GL
lol this cat is a card
nice transition
I'm not mad, I'm just impressed.
It sort of sucks the only cool club in my town is a gay bar
They actually have a really legit DJ
13I'm unsure myself
What?
4Glitch
DerpyGrooves he did it as more of a joke wtf mix :P
13Oh, and Spyropedia's suffering from a vandal
13Maybe
DerpyGrooves if you couldn't already tell
4!
yeah this is hilarious
JustinBieber didn't get me kicked?
...
I'm so hot
I love this mashup stuff
/me enters Buddha mode
/me hides
Literally my favorite song lately to mix has been maggot brain by funkadelic
DerpyGrooves tbh i cant believe he threw his timecoded vinyle at the end.
i was like WHAT
13The vandal claims that Spyro will appear in the next Super Smash Bro game, when the Spyro series is not even a Nintendo series
yeah that is insane btw
13Must be another Skylanders hater
your first love is your......nvm, innaprop XD
...
4yes
I hate thunderstorms.
I hate it.
thunderstorms annoy me
I love them
DerpyGrooves tbh at least your scene has good DJ's
4Uxie get this
The Storm that seems to bring out fear is comforting to me.
I LOVE the rumble in the sky, the lights, the growl, the dark clouds, strong rain
4I'm carrying a orb
TStorms are fantastic
Yeah it varies tho honestly
DerpyGrooves I found out the "DJ" for canadas largest anime convention..uses a laptop and winamp.
13Cool!
4and i jump to a ledge but Cynder falls
I know some completely tool jockeys locally
I tend to go outside to the garden and sit on bench, while rain soak me and lightning play the concerto
4She jumps all the way back up
i wanted to punch a basket of kittens when found that out
I've played with some of the local radio stations and it's sort of sad tbh
Fireant i love listening to music in the rain, especially chillout/tripchill
but yeah there's def. a decent music scene
A buddy of mine is actually personal friends with madlib
nice
The trip-hop producer
Graaand.
I know :P name sounded familier.
I love rain
lol :D
I hate thunder
I wish qbert would quit showing off and let us all catch up for two seconds
Rain lowers tornado chance. Which Kini has maternal fear of.

They didn't have one where I went
Yes

My rarity lives on my DJ controller and makes sure my mixes stay classy
I started singing the cupcake song at work the other day.

Except I replaced it with making popcorn since I work at concession.

DJ_MareMixer: Where at? I have family in Fort Collins.
Colorado Springs
I'm having a stump burn next week and and we should put together a brony meetup
Ah, I won't be there. ;)
btw yes I am the white trash asian

First you add a cup of kernel, add oil to the mix. Put it in the popper and add some salt, but just a pinch. Oh, popcorn, it's hot and crunchy it's popcorn. It yummy and tasty it's popcorn!
I go to foco every now and then tho

You do know that the cake and stuff is actually what we ponies live on for food, right?

thats a lie
Derpity. Stop changing nicknamesplease.
I swear by god if you say
If the cake is a lie, then what of the pie?

*takes the cork out*
Stop beating me to ittttttttttttttt!
Alright who should I do next?
or blue cheese crumbles
*starts chugging the bottle*
Luna had 1000 years to eat cheese. I think it would be unwise to offer her some more.
meh, wine is over-rated
drink water
haha
i saw a luna picture, on the moon, with Wallace and Gromit
I wonder who I shall do an impression of next.
from the episode where they go to the moon
and that made me happy
I voted for mccain!
Sarah Palin is a brilliant lady!
what does that have to do with cheese?
I voted for Ron Paul!
I vote for Harvey Dent!
or wine?
i vote for Arthur Dent
We need to close the border!
/me is really a diamond dog in disguise
they are done talking about cheese and wine
apparently
you know if he'd stop blowing up and all
he makes good sandwiches though
Dash should run for president. Then Politics would be twenty percent cooler.
12how is your infection coming along?
Or worse...
How am I supposed to stay competitive w. my applebuckin when south of the border ponies keep on stealin our jobs?
Well, it's Applejack. What? Come to dirty up the party here?
But Zaphod is already president
and he's a pretty hoopy frood
they can buck at least twice as many apples in half the time!
(Nice try but try to give her an accent)
Oh Ms. la de da rarity. I heard you voted for Lunobama!
Derpity.
Official fucking warning.
Change nick more and meet the banhammer.
End of warning.
4Nice music this game has
k
I didn't vote for him, mind you.
I didn't vote.
Applejack does not have the tolerance and patience for basic mathematics. Would you vote for somepony like her? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mrmBe-fFr4
can you guys see my text?
yessum
yes.
Yes jackie
she'd be a bad president
ok, i need some help
better
thanks :3
because she's the element of honesty
not that it matters when LUNOBAMA is taxin me out of house and home!
and you need to lie in politics
it's a rule
Why, mathematics is such a shrivelous matter, it's all about the pride.
is there an blog manager i can petition for a posting of an interview?
She's sendin gramma smith to a death panel, gonna make 'er inta glue!
Get that socialism out of my medicare! Oh wait...
well...
Well, that's just too bad, but Twilight is taking ME to the- errr, are we still talking about the same thing, here?
Quit tryin to take my gun away, lunobama!
...
sure lets argue about who gets to go the gala
You've gone medically insane.
Man, I can't enjoy my sandvich no more.
marriage should be between a mare and a mare! What's this bull hockey stallion-fillie nonsense?
((Man, Rarity is easy to RP))
Or a mare and an apple, that's also okay
mare and a muffin?
Yet again, you refuse to speak in eloquent english.
you're pushin it mailmare. W. your cushy government job and unionizin'!

(Seriously, as hilarious as this is, doesn't it belong in #EquestriaDailyRP )

EDRP is for serious RPing
there's your answer then
Ah
Not for derpity dept like here.

Anybody play any instruments?
A-anyone want to see a picture of my wings...?
I only use Vaan

Also how's my Rarity?
it's great :3
13???
Now, Fluttershy! I can't believe you'd lower yourself to that sort of level.
I-I... I think my twitter was hacked...
/me whimpers
What on earth is making you show men their wings?!
your*
Do you want to show off? Huh?!
12ok
13I use all six (three at a time). What happened to teamwork?
...Oh wait, am I scaring you?
I-I just can't help it... Also I heard my wings are really big, so I thought I-I...
I could show off ;-;
btw klondike I play literally everything you don't have to blow into
i like it when games give tips in the beginning of a level, at the loading screen
Duke Nuke Forever knows that too :/
/me flutters wings
And honestly, when was the last time you cleaned those wings?
"if you get stuck, you can always cheat by looking up a FAQ on the internet"
You're coming with me, to get a proper bath!
seriously? what game gives a tip like that?!
Y-yesterday, but I was busy all day working with the chickens... D: oh no
howdy
/me tries feebly to resist
/me drags Fluttershy to house
/me has unbelievable strength
;-; rarity, you know I'm no good at this... This sort of thing...
Hey Kraken.
I believe I have walked into some sort of weird role-playing game
sup my ponies
Stop with the naughty thoughts.
/me goes into the bathroom and takes a couple pictures of herself in the mirror+posts on twitter
And now it just got creepy
Whoa Kraken, I'm a Shark.

If the mods ever request we stop, we will.
It's like something a 3-year old would write while on a sugar rush
I'm having such great success with the powerpuff girls, I don't think I'll ever make another show!
I wonder what Lauren would think if she was ever on this chatroom.
did you miss balloons post?
Hello Lauren, in ten years you might make a show called "MLP: FiM"
I just wish to let you know.
wtf, that sounds stupid
*shows Cupcakes*
My little pony is dumb!
D: omg!
It will be a disaster and you'll go bankrupt.
I'm awesome
LaurenFaust10yearsago: It is dumb.
Now
Oh, just like my husband's stupid samurai jack?
Brohoofs for balloons
And you'll harvest a new breed of fans known as bronies.
But you, you my friend, have the power to make it great
'And what he said
And your husband
I liked Samurai Jack.
So tell me, future people, how does samurai jack end up?
The series does end, right?
I know my craig is way too awesome to leave such a great show on some stupid cliffhanger
Eeeeeeeeeeeeh........................................
tell me oh imposter Lauren, mind changing your name to something more sensable
About that....
Let's all talk about Pound puppies!
Woah thouse brouppies are crazy, right?
I lol'd
Puppy Power.
Well ok
I didn't.
that is what we say
I went to Toys r us the other day and got my first strawberry shortcake toy
Yo dawg, we heard you like dogs, so we got you a basket of kittens.
this schtick is stupid
something something gyrobowl
idk
13Still...
:<
...You all love fluttershy and pinkie pie, but what did I do to deserve your not love?!
/me is lonely
13It's not right to use only one. It's kinda unfair for the others
/me ruins all of rarity's dresses
/me offers Rarity a vibrant bouquet of flowers.
*madface*
I... I always liked you Rar... I like lamp. *runs off*
/me ruins all of carousel boutique
/me politely accepts flowers

/me tips hat
/me the entire shop is now a smouldering husk
/me calls fluttershy
FLUTTERSHY! Come quick!
Sweetie: Big sister, we didn't mean to wreck everything!
Scoots: Yeah, we- (Gets kicked in the stomach)
Usually I wouldn't punish you like this...
But...
/me ;-;
it's only a game
www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mp9rhtudaE
Applebloom: Miss rarity nooo!!!
How in the world did you get into my house?
Through the use of the Antikythera Mechanism.
We walked!
You WILL clean this up.
Now go on! Clean up.
Hmph!
/me sulks, hard
*walks away*
And thus, Rarity unleashed the Cutie Mark Crusaders upon the vital structural supports that hold up her shoppe.
And than!
SUDDENLY!
A HUGE FREAKING DRAGON
But then, Rarity realised that she just set it into doom!
send out the attack geese!
Crushed on the Boutique and ate all ponies.
The end.
Yes, I am at times, but then, things happen.
lol
What awa
And sudden Garry Smith comes in with his needle and thread.
A huge, freaking dragon that is.
Oops
And he builds a beautiful city.
A city of stars.
But then Fluttershy got mad at the dragon and disciplined it
And he regurgitated us all
I give myself a 6/10 for staying in character.
"What awaits the fate of our mane cast, the magnificent six within the belly of the beast? Stay tuned to find out!"
I gave u 1/10 for making Rarity silly.
are we doing impromptu roleplay on here now?
Also, as a reward, ban!
D:
That was nice.
;>
*takes out guitar and starts playing*
...
13Only a game!? It's the only game that can take my mind off of negitive thoughts!
4Night core mode
derp
I cannot do Dash's character, I don't think.
And Pinky Pie requires someone from Higurashi to play.
13Night, DSD!
Pinkie Pie requires the original recording of Baba O'Reily.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2KRpRMSu4g Here you go.
4But first some vandal killing
13Okay!
I could MAYBE do fluttershy if I study up a bit.
That's not the original recording. That's on YouTube, not on a tape reel.
Twilight loses her personality by the end of the second episode. -.-
Close Enough.
Mr. Ant.
And as I can somewhat match Keichii's insanity, it doesn't match Pinkie's.
I would like to inquire about your opinion concerning swearing in a fanfic.
Friends are complementary to her personality. Besides, she stays cooped up studying all day. That is not healthy.
Depends on how you use it, Kraken
Use it blindly and it will be boring and forced
well
only one character uses it
What, is this character the Cid of the group?
he isnt in the group
he is the saloon keeper of Appleloosa
And with joining the channel, as did he the herd.
Make it correspond with your rating then.
meaning
If it's T lower it to like "d-word", "p-word", that stuff.
If it's M you can be as heavy as you want
yeah
it has to be m
mainly fucking and cocksucker
HUSH
Dude
oh
whoops
It's PG in here
is this pg
I MEAN
everytime i enter this chat, it's really awkward
/flees
because whats being said out of context just sounds really wrong
Ban evasion will get you nowhere, good friend.
almost all the time
I was asking for scholarly advice!
For the sake of ART
havent you ever seen deadwood?!
no
ok but keep it PG. thanks
those words are hardly foul... they're poetic!
yeah my bad lol
Now, in special cases, if this is the only case where you are using heavy leveled type of anything, you can still make a T rated fanfic.
But if there's more violence and such and not just that, then you probably need to make it M
I don't make fanfics, but I can tell a good one when I see it.
03uh
backstabbing internet?
I liked the Portal fanfic.
space
03something like that
but
the one character curses like a sailor
MOOOO
Yeah, and is there anything else that's as high leveled as that?
Movies allow about 3 F-bombs before they cross over to R.
no
no like gore
R rated isn't what it used to be
or sex
only like the implication that sex occurs
not like, descriptions
Then it'll probably be ok, just put a warning on the pages that do, because sometimes people can be reading the wrong time.
and keep it PG plz
so its relatively tame
dang sorry
imma just leave, im too filthy for this place
Listen, let's take
This to uh
Eafterdark
Good idea.
was about to direct you there
Am i allowed to use my full range of expression there?
It's interesting how people take a show for kids and turn it into well... that kind of stuff.
No offense.
03LOOOOL NewEgg selling vibrators
03they just call it a "massager"
03yeah right
03we know what girls are really using it for
/me facepaws
03Pros: It vibrates, hard. makes her smile a lot ;)
03Cons: wasn't free
03Other Thoughts: Get it, believe me, she will thank your for it :)
03Pros: My boyfriend gave it to me for my birthday. It's good for sore muscles as well for giving explosive pleasure. It's best vibrator I ever had.
03Cons: It has quite strong vibration, I can use it only on low setting and over cloth - it's too strong directly on skin
03^ LOL

I've emailed him twice latley over something and well I've had no reply :( Which is dissapointing.
04As per all your chapters
he's busy. mad busy
Well, welcome to the EqD main chat Saftehpie.
I'm not sure how to spread the word to the UK Bronies otherwise is all ^^
Is it urgent?
06Yes
WE have two mods being british so , it's not bad here. Me being one of them
Sort of, Basically a UK internet store and I have had a sort of meeting of two minds recently and I challenged them over it and they were like OMG We were wrong.
xD
but like
it's getting bigger than 5000 words >:
which isn't good
I know it's quality not quantity
Now they've asked me to ask people for their input over products and such.
but if you have too much it's bad
They were trying to tell me that having My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic merc is too recent and Having Glee merchandise isn't despite the store being 1980's themed.
06More like you make the chance of getting any new readers approach zero.
06But that too
06:x
06Sadly enough xD
12 MILLIONS.
Woot.
And what MLP merchandise they have in the store is all G3 themed anyway so yeah.
Yup 12 M. ~yay~
Long chapters FTW > 10k words is awesome.
So after much discussion with them they've asked me to spread the news around and ask other bronies what designs etc they'd like to see on the clothes, characters, slogans etc.
lol
Chapter 17 was like
16510 or something words :S
try not to derp this time derpy
and yeah Xeli
Oh Derpy. *Shakes head*
derp*
sorry
(6_9)
06I mean something of the most obnoxious I know is when people obviously write longer chapters than they're actually "able" to
06When it gets repetitive and just plain silly
BRB just going to check on my kitties
kitty!
06It's high up there right with people searching up synonyms in casual conversation to seem more intelligent

people actually do that?
Defeat/Chapter 17 was so fucking repetitive it isn't even funny
I need to rewrite Reminiscence
06Oh I've seen people use words they have no idea what actually means in like an IRC channel and such. It's kind of funny :P
/me facepalms
06And when you point out that the word doesn't mean the exact same? Then you are the uneducated one. But yeah, just pet peeves. details are good, but there are something such as overly detailed :P
I don't think my fics are overly detailed
06Nah they aren't
but I start repeating events
which is shitty
and makes it boring
like defeat
06Well you know your "errors", that's the first step to fixing them :P
Yeah
quiet! i cant take it!!!!
I'm going to have to rewrite Reminiscence at some point
the first part is crap
and also
she deleted it shortly after
and said that her "mouse moved"

good thanks.

nice, what tags User_7174^
my third chapter should be posted later today
mmm, no not what you think
that fic series has ended
I'm just doodling some analysis on the mane six

plus, if that's not clear, no I'm not that write friend that wrote those 6 stories :p
I'm not really a fan of those
goodnight
It felt way too far off character
!todo list
too much to do ;;
I enjoyed it for the fact I wasn't really pretending those were patterns the actual character would fall into

yeah

!todo list
lol you have the same prooblem with typing
!todo del 2
I enjoyed the writing tho, and the last chapter was kinda nice
I didn't bother readingthat far
There's plenty other good fics anyway
no way one can read them all XP
I was surprised how good Spark was.
Yeah I have 13 in my window tabs right now
hehe, LOL
I was surprised a Shipfic could be so good.
10Back
spark... I really need to get into that one
wb Skylands
10Thanks
I have to look that on up
bronies surprise me all the time lately
>Shipfics are all about awkward scewing of characterization that make absolute nonesense
mainly how high the quality can be kept for all this time
But not Spark, which surprised me
i agree, but there are a few that are not that shippy
Then again, Luna has no characterization which allows the author to get away with it
In b4 Luna is made a valley girlfor s2
Like To the Nth Dimension is really good
yeah, for some it's less like, writing your OTP making out, and more, creating an enjoyable sotry
And everyone is BEGGING for NMM to return
nah
who's NMM?
i heard it before
nightmare moon
. . . . . .
it was so one-dimensional
oh
I mean, Merely a Mare was not what I would call a fun read. Magic space apples were nice, but turning Luna into an uncaring, disinterested foal was a terrible idea.
i feel silly
also give NMM more character. And a plan worth a damn. :p
I really like The Night that Never Ended
Nightmare_Moon: so that'll be the official characterization then? :p
yeah, I enjoyed it too
for some reason whenever I try to read that fic, i can't continue it
just can't
I have a file in my favorites list justt for fics
but NMM is still that typical tyrant, it's just that ponies below her mostly had some honor and values in them
I hear there are super-venomous spiders all over Australia
orly nao?
So how do your people even manage to live?
not just any fics, but pony fics
so they make it look partly good
heh, they do have snakes too
cute little things :3
NMM is a malevolent tyrant fueled by hatred and revenge.
the domination I mean
dur
hurr
I bet they'll bring in a new villian
/me shrugs
anyway
I'm going to go
yeah, a pilot-like episode or two might be worth it
And Luna a valley girl? really?
Wierdplatformer: if they go archbased maybe ...
Shai, I'm Affably Villianous.
^ more like harmless villain
not very friendly
lmfao
I'm gonna kill you... WITH TREES! OOooOOooOOooo
i think the new villain should be a dragon with some connection to spike
but evil
birlds + arms = ...? http://www.iywib.com/birds_with_arms.php
hmm, that would make it too important a character
*bitds
ok cut the connection with spike
we don't want it coming back after that first appearance
just a bad bad dragon
with bad intentions
and a bad ass
uh. yeah
I don't know a good arch would be cool
Reginald Spalding should come back for Season 2
I say they troll all the Luna fans and have the Luna ep be about nmm
http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/uk_no_horseplay_348190.html
What.
I want Weird Al to guest voice act so bad.
no that would be awful
If Luna's episode doesn't include me insome fashion, I'll be sorely disappointed
i agree with weird al
yeah, NMM is simply no m
more*
NMM still exists, just not in the same way
I mean, we get one episode about luna, and what it's all about is Trollestia making Luna flip out all over again?
no thanks
My armor remains in a broken heap in Everfree Castle
hahahaha
EXCELLENT
I would like the Luna episode to focus on Luna's guilt for being nightmare moon.
I am back.
oh come on it would be a lot better than that
that would be something else
and some other stuff
/me sends Hasbro Tosxychor's idea
That's a terrible idea Shaico, It should clearly be more along the lines of that fanfic Progress
Fireant'salive!
nooooooo- what have you done?
XD
Nightmare_Moon: they should give luna an abacus
well i don't read lots of Luna fanfics, so idk really
And then I was gone.
CYA LADS.
yes abacus
I thought everyone had read progress.
i don't think they'll give Luna an abacus
yeah,if they don't cameo an abacus in the luna episode, I'm gonna be disappointed
if they did, people would be saying "Oh they took the idea from the fanfic!"
O
maybe they should include it in the background
like a tip to the hat to the fans
yeah it's not like it's the most adorable luna fic or anything
:3
Shaico: thats what we mean
It's a shoutout
Hey a lot of the fanfics would be great ideas for episodes
yeah, just like the first derpy
like Luna actually holding the abacus and focusing only on it like the fics
mah bad
:3
it should be in the background when luna is in shot.
eeyup
or such.
yep
yea
going to spend the weekend at grandma's
that would make me fanboygasm
laptop already there, going to cycle to her now
i'll be back in a hour or two
me too, I admit XD
:p
almost as much as if they put Lyra in the background actually playing a Lyra.
Luna's episode better be above Celestia teir. That's all I'm saying.
So awesome.
Nice
Yeah, what if they actually catch up with the lyra fanbase
Hello!
I can imagine you rideing a lolipop
ello
and make it more important a character
bike
hey Dessert
Hi.
hi there
Nightmare_Moon: you know it'll be horribad like all of S2 :p
I wouldn't get it past them to constantly be looking at fanon stuff
i'm hoping that by the time season 2 comes, i would've converted my whole entire year.
well, just the most important stuff
Already converted 1/4 classes
in b4 g3.5 rd
like they did with Derpy and DJ-Pon3
I think they will put afew things into the episodes, but not flood them with fanon stuff
so when S2 comes out, we're gonna go and watch episode one ALL TOGETHER NOW
Bronies, all united as one
in a single room
YEA!
with a small ass tv
*brohoof*
NEIGH
Big TV!
woooo
I don't think they're allowed to use the names we've created for background ponies.
they already have
pfft, they can do whatever they want
why? if it's new ponies, they can name them how they want
derpy is like an official character now
aw dammit
i shouldn't have used that number
DJ Pon3 for example
but the official name isnt derpy :p
Because big corporations are afraid of liabilities such as someone standing up saying "I named that character, where's my royalties?"
he'll lift the band eventually
http://literallyunbelievable.org/post/6128970249/it-is-scam
yeah, it's not like the name will pop up much in S2 anyway
Chill out shaico
Tommorow you will be free to enter again!
they can't do that it's a fanbase collective decision
If they are a true fans they should feel complimented and go along with it.
how can someone even clain they named someone something?
Actualy, we dont know the official name, "Ditzy Hooves" was mentioned in winter wrap up but there has never been any cannonial link between her and our derpy
no ditzy doo
yup, ditzy doo
crap
mixed the name sup :P
Mephistopheles said that she can be Derpy if everyone likes
er
Faust
bbl watching MLP:FiM
/me RUNS
derpy wasn't named by Anon, that's why Derpy will never be canon. which is why if derpy is ever introduced she'll be Ditzy doo
yeah, it's not like it's a legal issue for friggin' everything
xD
anyhows, BBL
^ It actually isfoal
I'm fine with ditzy doo anyway
ditzy has less negative connotations than derpy anyways
actualy allot of it is when it comes to naming ponies, faust wanted to use the original G1 names for the mane 6 but habro nolonger owned the rights to them
except applejack
Derpy does need her Dinky though.
yep
bonjour
lol
yes dinky must be canon
hello ^^
Dinly is my muffin
dinku
i don't want Dinky to be cannon
dinky
lol
or Derpy
pfft XD
i mean
wait
nvm
fail
Dinky isn't a cannon
stop pretending they're stupid
lmfao
Derpy's already been given a nod of approval to be canon when they aired feeling Pinkie Keen, don't you pay attention to anything?
where did she even appear in the show?
I just realized I wrote cannon
kaBOOOOOOM
problem when they make things that were fannon cannon is that the fanon gets destroyed, i would just like the writers/animators to jst do their thing
plus being confirmed for s2
ggg
what was the episode in which they first noticed derpys eyes?
Well they can do their thing, but they can also take those ideas from fanon and evolve them
damn connexion
the very first one
first ep
hmmm...ive never noticed it
at pinkie's first party of the series
in the bgd
TO YOUTUBE
DesertRose, you're thinking along the lines that they give derpy actual characterization in the form that involves her opening her mouth
Geez, if only I could spell...
except, of course, for MUFFFIIIINNSSS
Derpy as a delivery mare became canon the day she dropped a piano, an anvil, and a wagon on Twilight's head
Desert you need to be pro and use Youtube to Mp3
I wish I knew who did her voice
hmmm, lemme check on that
Who did whose voice?
Very like random staffers in teh animation studio
Nightmare_Moon: which writer watched too much Wile E. that day ...
Derpy's voice actor isn't listed
yo anyone know which episode derped derpy's eyes first?
but Derpy has novoice! <_<
i wanna see it for myself
shai, #1
iirc
Episode one
or #2
time?
ALso, Derpy have one line.
Pinkie's party to Twilight
MUFFFFIIIINZZZZ
yeah, derpy had said oneline total, so it wasn't even worth it probably
true
one random VA did that line and back to her character lol
lol Photo Finish = Anna Wintour
lol awesome
did you know that lady who voices Rarity also did Luna and NMM
her mouth is scrunched up
Excactly like her
did you realize the AJ/RD VA was mostly talking to herself during the whole "Fall weather friends" episode lol
yes
yes i did
13Headache x_x
it was so funny when I found out XD
13ohai all, assuming anyone's here o-o
Hmm, I'm torn, should I have the Moonflower Sandwich, or the Dragon Fruit Rose Sandwich for breakfast...
same with Pinkie and Fluttershy
"I'm a year older than you~"
Nightmare_Moon: I heard the hopes and dreams sandwich is tasty
go for the dragon fruit
yeah, but she does both singing voices as well ^^ so awesome
actually ahe doesn't
Wierdplatformer: one VA for both insane characters, it makes perfect sense!
lol
who, the AJ/RD one?
10Heya
hold on I share the link
no the PP/FS one
yeah, I was talking about Ashleigh ball, the SJ/RD one

it's only that though

the voice actor for Applebloom does Sweetie Belle too

I wonder if the Italian edition will manage to keep up with the awesome
italian VAing was great in the past, but now... meh
doubtful
I'll keep an eye on it anyway
I'm glad I grew up with
English cause I suck at languages
:s
:(
being english is no reason not to study a second language tho :P
Oh I've studied french and spanish, i just suck
plus it's very interesting, you practically learn how people from other places think
No, no no no no no, no. Science fiction is more than just fiction set in space, it is more than fiction based on science aswell. It is fiction created to excite the reader and writer alike to possibilities in advancement of the human race, to explore the more attractive plausibilities of humanity's future!

they're kinda intuitive

so has anyone here read my fanfic?

who's Blues?
Trading Places
I read chap1 for sure
don't remember about ch2 tho
Oh cool
chap 3 should be up later
yeah I read ch2 as well
the premise is kinda cool
the mane six were also pretty in-character
Did you see the comments?
can't say I did
that one guy was going crazy like he skimmed it or something

even better
yeah, since the mods aren't asleep, the ponies may very well be
cuteness overload!!!
MLP Soundboard -> Can't hear you, I'm asleep
so who else is excited for all the good vg coming out this year
That soundboard needed 20 samples per character, not 10 XD
agreed
well, I rarely check on upcoming games, for three reasons
I am cut off from online play so joining multiplayer fads is not a incentive for me
older games run better on bad computers like mine
understandable
and they can be "acquired" more easily, if you know what I mean
I'm more of a console gamer myself
just less complicaed
tell me about it, I r**ed my GC/Wii while I had the chance

now I'm in college :p

man
I do not want to go to class
But on the bright side, I only have one class, it's an hour, and it's only a lecture
it's not that bad then :)
30 minutes after class, I'll be back home asleep
^^
The teacher is a total stereotypical sexually ambiguous male with dorky hair and square glasses
(It's a music class)
He's cool though so whatever
Definitely something to atten then :)

PONIES
indeed.
PONIES EVERYWHERE!
SO MUCH PONI
but still not enaugh poni!
there won't be enough until world domination happens
I just wanna curl up next to Fluttershy and not have any worries.
some ppl have a FS plushie already ^^
but that's not the point, going out of home shouldn't be a worry
rather an adventure ^^
I would get pony plushies
But I'm broke
And spending money on Yugioh
And my waifu
Soo
sew one yourself, there's plenty of guides on the interwebs
>me
>sew
it's not that bad XD
I am not very
*falls asleep listening to more ducktales*
Skilled at those sorts of things
plus think of all the pride once you finish it
I'm sure they'll churn out official ones anyway
Problem is
If I get one, I need the others
It's a completion-thing
ducktales, awesome!! ^^
(and so the one or two I have doesn't get lonely)
!ping
!bonk
!ching
Testing.
!boink
I'd also need one of Twilight
~

the more of them you want, the more convenient becomes to learn yourself to make them :p
Someone should start Equestrian Inquirer for all the pony and brony gossip. Stuff that aren't proper news for EqD but rumors, hearsay and just crazy things going on within the community.
looking if any nick is already pass protected, pinkie=?
pinkie?*
Heheh, yes. :3
perhaps I may consider this
It would also be a boon to my waifu
I hope none of the Pinkamena are murderer...
examples gingerale?
Looks like this one is free. /celebration
Tosxychor have you seen Gurren Lagann
eeyup
Well remember the guy changing his name to Rainbow Dash? That wasn't really EqD worthy but it would've fit perfectly for a blog like I described.
My best bro is like Kamina
sweeeet ^^
Seriously
Take every single motivational point about Kamina
that guy is hardcore.
But instead of being hyper and loud as fuck, he's laid back
all kinds of awesome then :D
I also used to be like Simon, an indecisive wimp who sometimes got bursts of motivation
And also whatever word someone catches on IRC would be newsworthy for a site like that.
My best bro recommended Gurren Lagann to me
I havn't seen or heard from him since early April
well gingerale, a trend like this may very well start after the whole thing gets bigger
that is, probably after/during S2
^^
No spoilers please. :c
DUMBLEDORE DIES
:O
(so does dobby)
The fact that he suddenly went poof like that concerns me after watching Gurren Lagann
As I'm sure you are aware of Tosxychor
!espeon
heh, yeah that could spring up worrying thoughts
I swear if he bit it without me I'm gonna kick his ass
I told him, I told him that the only way either of us would die would be by growing old together or backs against each other, swords and guns ablazing
What am I reading...?
.jpg
would there be aliens to kill?
but you haven't heard of him ever since? is that even possible in this era?
He is a very private man.
...
ok....
To be honest this isn't unusual. He'll randomly disappear for months at a time
Then he'll just appear out of nowhere like "Hey what's up you still kicking ass because if not I'll make you because YOU CAN DO ANYTHING"
And then the motivation of a thousand suns happens
LMAO, that's great
Dead
I still worry when he disappears like that
contributed some to the pony crusade yet?
cuz if I have to hunt his ass down and kick it for randomly dying on me I'm going to be a bit upset
13Not dead, just sleeping :3
What reason do you have to think he's dead, of all things?
(yes Nightmare Moon and Wheatley are a pair)
well, since he does it every now and then, I'd stop worrying after the 3rd time or so
Oh it's just always a possibility
(yes I ship them)
/me RUNS
He's gotten into some dangerous situations in the past
06Not sleeping, waiting
Oh, I see.
dangerous sports, or f-up situations?
That and I watched Gurren Lagann
For someone smarter to talk?
And the relationship between Kamin and Simon is exactly the same as between him and myself
*Kamina
F-up situations
oh
What, I'm not smart enough?
Ah
He's gotten in a couple of fights, usually because someone started shit around him and dragged him into it
Lemme guess
Drill
And Gurren Lagann
BREAKERRRR
Then he told me that story where someone shoved a gun in his face
What
a mugger?
cuz he got between one of his friends and a gang member trying to collect a debt
I swear his sense of chivalry is going to get him killed
I hope he's going to be alright :)
/me is injected with Latios, Lugia, and Lucario DNA
Hello
xD
Eh, he's fine
I'm not giving him enough credit
sup
nothin much xP
It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've ever seen to kill him
06~~
so, he's covered
Yeah
13.w.

He's the reason why I wear a core drill necklace proudly

Anyway, time for class
/me flies off
To be honest, I would probably take P3 over P4... P3's storyline was slightly less enthralling than P4's, but the feeling it created was incredible. I've never really loved a game as much as P3, just because of how it felt. Plus, the character development felt much better fleshed out in P3... That said, I love P4 too, I﻿ just prefer P3. I love me some darkness.

so what's everypony's course of action for the fox news VIEWERS?
?
Was that really even aired on tv?
Mine's nothing.
Dunno
i mean the ones that watched the note are the direct menace to us
It looked so low-budget that it was hard to believe.
I live in Europe, so it doesn't really touch me personally
Also
Big great question
13Good luck :3
06Good luck Chimewra
Are you afraid of death?If so whats the type of death do you want?
What i'd do is laugh at em and say "lol u watch foxnews"
Personally, death is my biggest fear and I can't imagine any death that I would accept/want.
@Insidious
hah!
A quick one
death...
I like to think I'm not really afraid of death
Ha
I believe in reincarnation after all
let it be as it wants
I don't want to suffer xP
a quick one that doesnt involve a bullet to the face, or poison.
I feel a weird strum in my body when i say the word "Death"
Ah
To be exact
Everyone dies
isn't it PinkamIna Diane Pie?
rocks fall?
Just remember that you're mortal
to me, its just something that happens :/
Thats all i can give now
I'm blue~
Or cyan
I've only seen it with an E, but that's possible. c:
AE, Guess what, I might be doing a show today
and tomorow
Pinkamena Diane Pie
Its right
seeing as im being asked to host the friday show this week
Persona 3
A show?
Everything about the life of a daily teenager

But not normal

Memento mori~?
Awesome MAD AMV
What
Ahh.
check the current show thats gonna be on today
Google search for Pinkie Pie quotes
Still kept wondering what memento mori means
"Remember your mortality".
turns up a page titled "Is Pinkie Pie insane?"
Like saying "remember that you will die."
Last 2 of my 20 exams happen to be on the same day. :/
Ah
No, you just don't understand how we cloudcuckoolanders work
mort mean death
Have you played the 4th one?

Yes. c:

is that latin?

LOL yeah
Hey
I loved playing as her.
She has interests on pink i believe
Tee hee.
And Mc is in blue
Yup. c:
Rather pick Male since i love blue too
Playing as her was different indeed xD
Too different
But they end up being stuck in the same problem
Why wub woo
yeap
Yeah, it wasn't too strange, though. The only difference was male dating options, haha.
And is it a coincidence that i have the same hair type and color of the Male MC?
Ha
I'm trying to figure out the best video to explain what is a brony. So far my best candidate is PONIES The Anthology http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg
A brony is a pony watcher
ponycraft 2 is deemed very good to the cause by many
No I mean the community
All thats needed to know
And culture within it
oh, srry
Hm
Ginger
Use the fox news vid

yeah, ponies is mighty good
Oh gog
