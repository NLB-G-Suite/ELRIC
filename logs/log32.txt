/me lurks
lurkers... they only arise when the lights are off and the time is right...

or when they are the mods

The evil enchantress jazz is pretty banging
SPAAACE

^yes
5Oh that reminds me that I still need to get IRC for Android.. the app or whatever
03Android IRC
he should have RD as a picture
03it's not free but it's worth it
5Is it pretty easily found in the Market?
XD
4@Quanyails
haha
5Well then I'm not gonna get it lol.
lol
I got a scoop
/me 4is back!!!
03there's a free version
a scoop?
5O:
5Donde?
03just search for Android IRC
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPF_9nxJZkc&feature=relmfu
/)^3^(\
4lol
But did it wrong the first time
*applauds*
switched the pics
4Rolplay4life, I didn't know you spoke italian
Wut?
i got lagged
4uh, forgot the "e"
03hm
oh
I'm at my moms
03apparently there's no longer the free version
Gah alright
03you have a laptop, that's no excuse
I wrote a bad fic. My fault yes.
5xD I was too lazy to put on the accent.
03use EasyTether
hi there, Free
And my desktop is currently unusable
The response wasn't exactly friendly though :/
That's what's its called?
03yeah
03that's not free either but I can give you the apk
now i only want you goooooooooone
Cool
don't feel bad, man, my first attempt got rejected too
now i only want you gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooone.
and i quote
lmfao
4What song?
03hm
not a terrible response, but neither is it constructive
yeah, I wrote a story before and he denied it
i'm worried he'll deny mine :(
Because apparently I'm a communist ._.
this is why I post all my shit on ponychan first for feedback
< dying of anxiety, haha
guyz i gotta go
Bye!
jbye!
03stupid iTunes, work already
bye :(
4Be Prepared and Exile
yeah probably a good idea
03anyway Roleplay4life I can just give you the file for Android IRC if you don't mind pirating it
4From both movies, of course
join Pony-Tales group, people there aren't trying to be harsh
well, i have to go, did you guys want to take a look at the story?
eeeeyup, Night
i had a fied trip today at school
Oh, a story?
Only had 1 OC character
Well, shoot if you'd like
mine has one as well
my OC character is me
But this is more something for EQ study
Hello?
but I don't overpower myself in anyway or anthing
Hello!
also word of advice from the lab boys (sethistio) he does NOT accept stories about communism.
ohhay
hehe
gnight everypony!
g'night!
goonight!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSzv7qylfEoN2c3TwWSlGSOKMhec1P-6hKvenXD22jk/edit?authkey=CMOZpvAG&hl=en_GB
hope you enjoy, pleasure meeting you all
4i'm gonna do a Random Match
see ya
Bye!
But...COmmunism is magic!
my story was called "fall of stalliongrad"
what's this Pony-Tales someone mentioned?
Do you think equestria is a communist nation?
It's a group on DA
I'd say he denies that too
ahh
at the nypa
That focuses specifically on fanfics
everyone has a job and they all conrol everything
EVERYTHING
monarchy/democracy?
I had a People's Republic of Equestria in one of my Vicky 2 games =P
Night, National Socialism is a different system
I don't post there, unfortunately
It might be aTheocracy
the weather, the seasons, etcx
lol
Well, they revere her as royalty more than they do as a religious leader
yeah, but she can lift the freaking sun
exile?
/me sighs* It's not communism, it's called "United Order"
but I won't discuss that
lol
4anyone wanna battle? :P
*facehoof*
do you mean my lullby?
I wondrr if they have a church of celestia or something
No LOL
4Quan?
no, they just have Celestia being there in person
I mean, people worshiped Caesar
Well, not necessarily CogWeaver
03anyway, I'm gonna upload EasyTether in a sec
no need for a "church" when they can just go see her in person
but he wasn't a "God"
Yeah exactly
anyone else thinks this is a win? http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/165/7/1/rainbow_revelations_by_sefling-d3iwb5g.png
K
No
Lol
03well you need one :/
We have history of Gods on earth being worshipped directly
exactly, Workin
Might as well wait til the weekend
As a physics majro, I believe she's lying through her teeth >.>
Applejack's flashback to Manehattan, the ponies there seemed pretty grump.
03well then I'll wait, remind me
yep k
city people are like that though
Yeh but that doesn't imply a lack of an organized worship structure E.G. a church
well not in britain
Could've just been blowing it out of proportion on purpous.
Think about this too, the fact that there are huge buildings in Manehattan imply a huge industrial society.
but in NYC yes.
hooh54 do mean my lullby
03oh
03look at that
4Oh, did you ask her or something?
03I already have EasyTether uploaded LOL
why are horses pulling it?
03since someone else wanted it
or they don't have coal?
Maybe the engine is more of a generator to power the electricity in the cabins
5And kind of lolrandom.
03Roleplay4life do you want a link to Android IRC?
Possible.
maybe adding the extra horse-power increases speed?
Do they even have electricity?
8he/she told me in a thread
well they have lightswitches
and lights
7Yes, Hooh54? *late*
It seems really variable.
and cameras
Eh I dunno Cog
4Ah
03http://goo.gl/wdvus
yes my point exactly
Like it's extant, but not particularly common.
5Hm, not right now. I don't really need it, but thanks for the offer...
Yeah. My idea is that it's 20's era technology, but cultural and artistic advancements are very progressed
03eh
03I guess I'll delete it then
yes
Steampunk?
eh, kinda
steampunk is more 1880's and such though
guys, you're all forgetting 2 very important things:
1. Magic
I guess Dieselpunk would be the closest analogue
2. IT"S A SHOW
Larger cities might have them, but Ponyville's electricity is likely based around personal generators.
lol
Yeah but it's our job as the fans to overanalyze everything
dude, have a nap or something
A-doy
I can't
But exercising our critical thinking is FUN! ;D
I'm kicking my sleep schedule into line
exactly ^_^
yeh, yeh, I know Workin
ahh
Also, Magic is just energy manipulation ;)
MAGIC POWERED TRAINS?
Everything is energy manipulation when it comes down to it.
why not use magic instead?
Energy manipulation and magnets.
:P
MST3K mantra ftw
Magnets power the world
4Quan, can we battle now?
exactly.
hmm!
Everything you perceive as solid is actually just the repulsion of like magnetic fields
If you van't explain anything, MAGNETS is the answerr.
Or, they have gecko feet ;)
If there were any meme I don't get, it's the whole "ask a Mormon about magnets, it's funny"
can't*
7Almost, Hooh54.
or they wear horseshoes
4i thought it was because Smeargle knew Sky Drop
4but it's not that
ouch ._.
magnetic horseshoes
7If it's a forced conversation, perhaps we're not interested.
I don't think horseshoes are nailed on in Equestria
but they no doubt have them
my head hurts
(not that we the viewers can see, anyways)
8well, i think they put the scam thread there for legal reasons
Such as Pegasi walking on clouds.
Its already 4 ufh
That counts.
Shoing horses never hurts
it shure does
EQS?
XD Suddenly, geth.
All ponies have magic inside of them (Hence the whole "cutie-mark" thing) but only unicorns can push that magic outside of their bodies
03LetS not.
They probably have tactile telekenesis (or, magic)
If you don't get the internet's obsession with magnets I'll show you the source.
fuckin magnets, how do they work?
has anyone made a Pokemon-Ponies image cross? I want to see "A Wild Rainbow Dash has appeared!"
03fuckduck
Pegasi magic manifests as an ability to reduce their own mass and inertia.
Yes,
Looks like Rising's gone?
Yes they have.
jerkcircle
4no
Rozon, http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/pokemon/1
thanks
Which are more or less the same thing.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs
there.
lol`d
Mormons and magnets huh weaver
I have to see Life's manager about how these fucking magnets work.
^
Just throw CL at him
Some fics have the sun and moon being enormous contstructs.
4[Your] Zoroark, [your] Hydreigon, Cofagrigus, Oshawott (Chao VI), Smeargle and Toxicroak
well i think it's either they have no explanation for them due to their beliefs
like "I own a horse"
7Don't see anything wrong...
Hasa Diga eebowai
7Items?
4Smeargle knew Sky Drop but i replaced it
i own a horse!
Chzo Mythos!
seriously
4oh hold up
7Connecting to wi-fi, Hooh54.
I dunno, had to bring that up too.
suggesting multiple weird shit things, ranging from dyson sphere to a rogue planetoid terraformed into a functional biosphere
4Hmm
wait...how would Mormons not have an explanation for magnets due to their beliefs?
Does that mean ICP are Mormons?
I wish I did, I'd name it rainbow dash and enter it into the grand nationals
yeah I'd say the second option cog
ICP?
Ohh . . Dyson Sphere. But wouldn't you be able to see the other side from the ground? . . . unless there was a smaller sky-sphere INSIDE the Dyson sphere . . . *head hurts*
oh
...
i posted a link
*facehoof*
yes, I saw
view it lol
mabey if we move to finland and change her name...

4dude, you hate 5th gen, all 5th gen
03who said we're voting
pinkie is made of pure energy.
03I'm superior to you, my word goes :D
Pinkie Pie is made of everything: she IS the universe
/me runs
it's how she can bend physics
or at least seem to
7Talk to me on wi-fi, Hooh54. :3
i have to take care my chickens now beback
It's called ADPD
4ok
PINKIE PIE IS HARUHI SUZUMIYA

Flaskgarg is still banned?
4that was the first time i found magikarp useful

Hm? Why?
D&D ._.
It's not like I'm actually using D&D stats or anything.

all midnightwave is doing is pissing off the members
It's constant through all the levels

except HE can kick students out for poor performance
ok
and is veary cute
but you can switch characters
i'm sytarting to like the idea of lost vikings, but ponies
I feel terrible
and you have to get all of them across obstacles
Context-based means certain things only happen in certain situations
/me 4is curious
in order to win
4!chatstats
Most games have a context button
Or action button

I can, however, see Lucas sticking out like a sore thumb.
That's because you're not special.

/me huggles her cat
I'm not special, no.
8that was honestly one of the worst ideas i have ever heard

I wish that Applejack was in SSB4, yes.
/me blahflops
I'm not.
I wish everyone was in SSB4
You aren't?
While we're on games... anyone here play the Myst series?
EV. RY. ONE.
3Kosoveon!!!!!!!
That would just be werid to see ponies in SSB
/me 3glomps
I want everyone to be in SSB
8lurkers come alive
I've played it Fuzzy.
Long time ago.
hahaha
absurd and amazing.
When I was...nine I think.
Same here.
4Well, I see SoiPony made it
*luke
I want Lucas to be FIXED in SSB4, INSTEAD OF BEING A PUSSY.
Same. I played the shit out of Riven too
Night, with the same creepy voice from Mortal Kombat?
11soisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoi
Yes!
I'm about to replay Riven.
4Don't know, not Daxton
Muwahahaha!
4Daxton appeared later
lol
12Hey Kosovo
Lucas was like, one of the strongest characters in Brawl.
cho
A wild Daxton appeared?
not here
Wait name is still long
4Cho?
How long has that been like that
4His name was just Cho?
I dunno lol
just throwing names out
Riven used to scare me.
6It was ChoPony or somthing... Oo
Bye
6Heck if I know.
Stupid...eel things.
later
lol
4Thought it looked something like that
8where are all these people coming from?
Wow...
11So, are you all from PoniBuru
Seriosuly...
Everfree forest
I have little tolerance for games like Myst. Never have.
11?*
04meow
Why are you gusy talking about me?
3sooooooooo
4Soi, Clockwork and their other friend were here last night
had any, I mean.
Cute Ponies?
3what's up?
and no
Myst, Riven, etc. were FUN games
Yeah.
Of course.
4Livestream watching :3
lol
8gotcha
*shrugs* They aren't for everyone.
4LOLCPCPCPCPCPCP
I was always creeped out by Riven as a kid.
11Well, sorry to dissapoint, but the show isn't until tomorrow night.
04:3
same, but then I grew up
and discovered it was AWESOME
4Pretty much, and then Saturday afternoon
it's ok
Myst was way creepier than Riven.
Ness' handles like a goddamn hog.
8...
lol
3lol
uhh
Hey everybody
I just got off Magic for this,
3i'm on livestream too
Call of Dooty.
Lucas' is a dream and does things like pierce and hit multiple times.
Hopefully it'll feel less like Melee-on-the-Moon
I got really good at it on the N64 version, though.
Fuzz I've played Cyan's older games, like the ones for the Apple 2, they were even more abstract.
I know the feeling
lol
02Kosoveonnnn~
Yeah, Ness' thunder seems to handle WORSE than it did in prior games, and it handled like SHIT.
/me glomps
ST_Falcon: I got really good at it on the N64 version.
6...did the Daily /oat/ get put up today? Oo
Yeah, also, HECTOR FOR 4
WANT.
Nightboomfer: Flight would work the same way Kirby floats upward
you could do it for a long while, but eventually you'd have to stop
Many little jumps,
Hello my dear ponies
Hi
yeah, otherwise RD would just be ultra-broken
Hello
I don't really pay attention to the Daily /oat/
yeah, but in RD's case, they'd look like wing-flaps
speaking of pony sites....what's going on with fillydelphia?
Hallo
OhYeaPinkiePie AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
4ARGH is leaving
hai Kiniest
lol
hi
(Implying she isn't already ultra-broken)
11No, that's Argh's goodbye message.
The day
11There aren't enough reports to warrant a Daily /oat/ thread just yet.
hadn;t come
I just realized, my hand is attached to my arm.
6Ah.
Ponstuff?
Dedede.
11Soi: I don't know, I don't go to that sight.
AJ'd play like Dedede.
Fluttershy'd be more like jigglypuff than anything else.
Twilight like....
Ness?
Ryu
You must be going out and cutting the ingredients, then.
Lucas?
I have never done drugs :D
NO
6Preferably the latter, Doon.
Fluttershy would be an assist trophy.
IMPOSSIBLE
6I haven't smoked since Tuesday.
Twilight'd be like Zelda.
11The tell me which flight of steps you fell down.
RD like Meta Knight?
That'd be the shiz.
or maybe Mewtwo
Seriously, I've never smoked or thought of smoking, I just think of random manure to say.
She'd never fight otherwise.
People have least favorite ponies?
I don't have a least favorite pony, but I have a least favorite griffin..
11Gotcha.
Rarity, I dunno.
Rarity'd probably be more like Marth than anyone else.
My least favorite pony is applejack
I have 3 nipples.
Rarity would be AMAZING AS MARHT.
This is a tough one... My least favorite is probably Celestia :/
THAT WOULD ALSO BE THE SHIZ.
^That
COUNTERING FUCKING O!
Marth is the lowest on the manly list
And Pinkie would be like Wario or G&W.
Rarity, probably more like Peach. Whip her tail around, deflect with gems, etc.
Pinkie Pie.
okay lets say there was a button and the button when pressed destroys Rarity
*GO
WOULD YOU PRESS IT
Until Spike grows up.
Twilight = totally Cortana
/me presses said button 100000000 times*
sure
I would hit people if they attempted to hit that button.
Then hit the button for them.
...?
I have learned something
Derpy could be like Taskmaster in MVC
I can see pinkie as Zelda really
Pinkie as Deadpool/BB Hood
Toon Link

Pinkie/Pinkamena
Ice Climbers.
3good night to all fellow TSTers
ﾄﾅｽｲ
Haa, Nightmare_Moon's already ahead of me.
Sure
Dang japanese type righting
3sowwy
Pinkie would just be Pinkie
3i found celebi
11Woah. *pokes the arm*
3but not jirachi
Ka-mo-meel?
3ill keep looking
she'd have her own fighting style
Hey don't touch my 2nd arm.
THAT or she'd fight like crazy-hand...
7Thank you.
6I'm in ur email readin ur drafts
lol
Damn, Fooby, You're good.
^ Yes. Nuff said
DUDE YES, Pinkie would be the boss at the end of the single-player
Pinkie = Crazy Hand
Does Fluttershy have a crush on spike?
Y/Y
PLEASE
Y
PINKAMENA FLASHING ACROSS THE SCREEN ONCE, AND ALL OF THE ENEMIES ARE TURNED INTO 'Freinds'.

hi
*troll face*
6Make the Post-Show say something under it though...
Applejack? Best?
I was thinking that
D:
YES
OMG
Did we do that?
Speaking of applejack... any suggestions for a hat for her toy?
I advocate for Fluttershy!
Something cheap, preferrable
6XD
If, um... that's alright...
I understand perfectly.
6I'm watching him write up a draft in the BMN email account.
11There.
*loves and tolerates Kiniest*
6Looks good.
oO_
I agree, Inny
The sea ponies are the best
^'
Luna got ONE cutscene.
lol
For some reason I wanna ponify an Ed, Edd 'n Eddy scene :d
30.0 seconds of screen time
/me follows suit
>_>
Hi
But...Luna has an abacus!
30.0 exact?
That's not canon, Inny
30 seconds flat?
+/- a second or two
Says you!
8silver
11Thursday Update email has been sent. Structure of it has been saved to a word document.
8you might want to say the pre-show starts "around" 2
it's not canon, it's fanon
*snuggles DJMidli*
I grew up with the Star Wars prequels! I can decide what's canon!
touche
I seriously want to zap the shit out of DJMidi for touching my younger stepsister.
I thought Fluttershy was the Tsundre
Lucas zap away..I like it.
6I'll be here by 2 I'm sure.
Fluttershy is a YANDERE
11lol
8ok
Ooooh
11Nice.
right
tsundere*
fluttershy is a tsundere
she's nice
except when people fuck with her
Kiniest: no, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy is the yandere of the cast
but she's also a yandere
D:
8hell, i might be back by 10, i dunno
<_<
Un-pronounce-able names hurt my eyes.
you said tsun, not yan
I said Yan
LolkiddingIcanpronouncethat.
[21:08:54] Fluttershy is a YANDERE
oh

10Well, I'm off
plz stop using weab terms...
Or the other way around.
I'm spacing out, alot.
weaboo weaboo
I said that
I need to change my name...
Fluttershy rarely ever has shown a could side
Weeaboo terms would be gratuitious Japanese like KONICHIWAAAA
DERP
11Just changed that. :P
Tsundere is a word for which there is no replacement in English
D:
i wasn't making fun of ponies.

11For whoever asked, I have a bad habbit of clearing my inbox.
Not Close Enough

I'd side with the turdles

Crew's doin' well CW, Jayne's got a gunshot in his arm but he'll be alright, other than that everything's gorram beautiful.
*loves ponies*
The best thing (next to ponies) to happen to TV.
It got canceled.
.YLF. ERIF. SI. TAHW
Okay.......
And then the alliance came. China+USA.
Why should I care?
it got canceled after it's first season BECAUSE FOX IS DUMB AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
6lulz
Why didn't they just transfer the rights to scifi?
[INSERT SOMETHING INTERESTING]
makes sense to me.
But I don't really care about Luna, or the other characters.
I like them, but don't care.
^
Not really how it went, but yeah Fluttershy's the reason I wasn't there.

You ponies sure are an interesting bunch hehehe.
Kiniest: You're being silly, Faust worked through season 2, season three is out of her controll though
Well then
Season 2: Still good
Doom 2 on ultra violence is hard D:
I fear for season 3
I still have hope for season three.
Season 2, who's taking over?
4DoonJoe just got my attention
i doubt that seasons 2 or 3 is gonna slip
4What port?
port?
DosBox
4Ah
4Nice
Yeah, we're more interestin' than mudders on Jayne-day, Cap'n. Don't get freaked out by us or anythin

Hah, it's okay, y'all know I've seen freakier.
they won't let it fall to THAT level again
;)
I took that off of a picture I saw a while back, but I can't find it.

I still get nightmares about going through that Reaver territory.

Gonna stab *ALL* the people!

Worst Case Scenario of a Pony Invasion. IT. IS. NOT. G4.
Wait, when'd you do that Cap'n?
I really can't wait for Season 2.

Miranda? Never heard of it. you sure you didn't just dream of it Cap'n?
THEN MAKE PONY INVASION G4.
11Introduction added.
4Where can I view it?
And a good one at that.
That's an earch author, right?
fck miranda.
aaaanyways, you said somethin' about raisin' the Browncoats here with the pony-folk, Cap'n?
faygo all the way!
To each his own
Yeah I was thinkin they'd have a stake in fightin' the oppression and such.
4I figured we'd be in it, but it's empty : /
I'm still gonna stab ALL the people while still being insanely cute.
I still say that if G4 ponies invade, they'll kill us all for not being friendship-ish enough. That's why I'm trying to find recruits for the inevitable Zombie/Robot/Alien/Pony combined-invasion.
grr stab kill
kill stab grr
I mean Earth
Ivan2294: I would GLADLY die for the Pony cause.
Except against the Dailecs
or w.e.
6It doesn't need anything in it really.
11I was jumping around with names.
Go Cog Go!
Okay, how about this. Combined invasion. G1 - 4 ponies all invade. If you want to keep G3 from taking ove the world, you still have to fight all other generations.
Which side would you take.
I've got no problem with it Cog.

Damn I fell into a hole and right once I landed I was killed :<
4But I prefer Doom II much more
TROTSY LIKE LUNA!
This hardly qualifies as rp, capt_slowpoke, its really more like banter... Silly banter really.
Hey now, don't make fun of the lady.
*hug attacks*
I think Unreal or Quake 2 was my first.
Role-playing? Son of a b*tch, ITS A MINEFIELD IN HERE.
*Avoids metaphorical role-playing mines*
How slow could a slow poke poke if a slow poke could poke slow?
4That means that you played Unreal or Quake 2 at an earlier time than Doom II, which is when you played it around 5
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here

This is more then angrily slow, it's brutally aggressive slowness.
Magic.
Luna is into sadomasoquism or sometihng?

How does magic work
Magnets.
Flamerunner: and that's starting to get into the EAD level of things.
'Twas playful humour!!!

MY FACE HAS A HORN ABOVE IT :O
Celestia needs to earn my respect.
And hi luna
Of course Luna, you're a unicorn.
Same with most people, although I respect most people by default
Silly fillies
hi Pure_Hatred
But Celestia lost that respect with the whole over-punish Luna thing.
Ivan2294: right, because someone threatening to kill off all of ponydom should be left alone
RvB reference ftw
TBH Luna got off easily :>
oh
SIGH
DIFJISDJOF
I don't know, I found the act of tormenting Celestia while in Luna's body was quite fun.
I just think that 1000 years is a little long
wtf hatred
Do you expect me to talk!?
NO! I expect you to watch!
A little long is an understatement
Sister missed baby Luna? Torment her dreams every night for 1000 years.

I'll tolerate, but only because I don't really care.

We spend the most our lives livin' in Celestia's paradise
hahahahahahahahah
............
I've been in the moon being a female for 1000 years, before you were born.
there are no sex changes on the moon.
I beg to differ.
Born in the year 2294, just putting that out there....
thats false
. . . . . .
and the pOrtal's cores?
oh! lol!
No, I had to leave him behind.
She came back before they were sent to the moon.
Why doesn't anyone ever take that into account?
THEY DIDN'T STAY ON THE MOON, THEY FLOATED AWAY.
hahahahah+
Luna, the moon is cold?
Yes, the moon is cold idiot.
Hello everypony
ooooh
D:
Is the moon grey
poor luna
Hi Keideki
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be rude anymore.
D:
DOES THE MOON EXIST
You guys are asking for it.
hahaha
*love*
Luna, at least you walked with MJ. How was it?
i gotta go, Celestia wants me up early tomorrow
Oh wow, the stupid conspiracy theory meme.
*sigh*
see ya
wait me, i need coffee D:
Wow Silly. You win internets. Many, many internets/
*follows luna to bed*
see you guys later
wtf
haahha
/me noms internets
Luna's actually a man.
I'll bet.
yeah
No sex changes on the moon.
Humans in my Equestria?
I thought we already established that.
where did I put those conversion bereaus....
They faked the whole banishment thing.
It's a consipracy D:
Yeah
MAGIC.
yeah!
Ouch.
No she wasn't a prob, she's just an actress
She's a ganger.
An actress skilled at illusions...
yep

Oh

Er, Trixie.
No a ganger *sigh* *facepalm*
Darn catchy shipping term.

That's just goggledy-goop.

Luna WAS banished, but just ina dungeon, not on the moon.

The moon was a dungeon, foal.
Hmmm....
Nah, she was just at Evil Rehab.

Can't let that story get out, these chronic evil problems RUIN politician's careers.
=)
Both. Star wars fanfic.
Problem solved.
Nuu. I'm gonna work on my other fanfic.
hahahahahaha
Another piece of evidence, Celestia sent her student to deal with the "threat"
OBJECTION!
If she was a REAL queen she would've taken care of it herself.
OVERULLES
Rainbow Solo.
No it was the summer sun celebration. I win.
Obiwan...Trixie?
Whats the EQ IRC here for writers again?
where is the queen? D:
No, no, Celestia is Obi-Wan.
There is no queen you foal.
Also, she has time to do casual things when infact she would have to be way to busy with both the moon and the sun.
No, no...
Wait...
Queen.
Pure_Hatred sanks
Rule of Princesses dictate that queens are evil
DARTH TRIXIE.

6To be fair, I did accept the battle knowing full well there are a couple saged threads on /oat/
I'd like to dream about ponies. But I rarely remember ANYTHING
6Which interferes with his GET style, but not mine.
After you got hit by the train did you wake up???
is that normal?
ANY. THING.
Yes mane_attraction, I did
I once had a dream where I hit /mode +b *!*@* then kicked everyone from this channel
felt good man
:o
Good because that would have been a painful dream.
no, don't!
then Rainbow dash said "come on stand up!"
I once had a dream about banjo-kazooie
And you stood up!
Hello flutterstare
It was boring...
hi Kiniest
welll
why?
then i grabbed a MP-40
why not, Kiniest?
it was awesome.
Because I don't, Fluttershy
/me *hugs*
I once had a dream that was a mixture between Digimon, Gmod, and something else....don't remember much...

Wait, and here I thought the 2294 bit was just random numbers.
But it ended quickly
oh
lol
RP is alwasy nice
And before you ask, no Equestria has yet to be contacted.
Let's try that again, from the top.
okay
In the year 2552 Celestia makes herself known to the world along with Luna, to open Conversion Bereaus around the world and begin widespread ponification.
no, um... no, i didn't
Well, considering I was only in the 2290s I don't really care now do I ...
but um... i did read it...
Ok, comma fail
>_>
woo, smrpg beat
and it scared me...
... I am going to go back in time
And they did succed in taking over hawaii
Man if I live to see 2290s I expect Star Trek type goings on

Many, many layers.. How long until we reach their dimension?

Hmm....long time.
*strokes chin* Oh well.
everyone loves pinkie
Shoggoth, the physics of a dimension also apply to any objects FROM that dimension
NO U
Hallo
If pinkie were say blue, would her name still be pinkie?
that's because you're not skilled enough to have any
blue pie?'
Technically yes
:P
because colors are only how we percieve reality
links, please
Still, Dimensions are more appropriately reserved for the X,Y,Z planes and the T plane
maybe we are the ponies
we just percieve ourselves as people
AHAHAHHAHA
AAHAHAHAHHAH

Or use OC ponies, alternatively.
Yes Ossala that is correct!
she's die

She would get stupid horny and paranoid
then implode
Then explode again
Can you do that?
And then she exploded... twice.
Twilight would never read such drivel.
and then turn into derpy
YOu...
13The same with Ratchet and Clank: They never appeared alongside FFXII characters
>_>
all like "Let's have make outs, rarity omg our horns are touchiiinnggg"
13The man that said "Nice" in ISFH is the main reason why these restrictions are on

13Where is Sparx?
I just write whatever comes to mind.
Just a heads up, tho. I did ONE half-assed pony remix and it got more views than any of my other music ever
4Hunter has him
13Okay!
DerpyGrooves: ... that's kinda depressing actually

13That's right!
You don't mind if you link it DerpyGrooves?
I would like to hear the remix.

oH SNAP
Trumpets are cool.
lol
Remember, if you're going to RP Pinkie, make sure you're drunk.
And ignore the 4th wall
I got it for 100$ and tbh the platters are on par with my stepbro's 3000$ CDJ setup
And try to act like Rena Ryuuguu every now and then
doubtful. its Numark.
No, if you really want to RP Pinkie, consume a boatload of sugar. Sorry if you are diabetic..
and if hes got a 3k setup is probably pioneer.
If you try to roleplay me, act stupid.
DerpyGrooves: yes.
4Cool
4Cynder=win
Especially the trumpet is easy to screw up :P
I still need to get an audio interface
(besides, low brass >>>>>>> silly trumpets)
All the chicks dig it
Same here
g2g
I'll get a trumpet, but I'll get in touch with some of the old jazz cats in my town
/me shudders
By bible reference.
*bye*
Yeah I was looking into that, but I think the numark is just easier to interface
How about Pony metal?
*Cries*
best platters for the price point, too
does the hercules have touch-sense platters?
Kiniest: I'm sorry but even PURE_HATRED has standards :<

The series does end, right?
I know my craig is way too awesome to leave such a great show on some stupid cliffhanger

The end.
Yes, I am at times, but then, things happen.

Oops
And he builds a beautiful city.
A city of stars.
And he regurgitated us all
I give myself a 6/10 for staying in character.
I gave u 1/10 for making Rarity silly.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2KRpRMSu4g Here you go.
4But first some vandal killing
13Okay!
I could MAYBE do fluttershy if I study up a bit.
Twilight loses her personality by the end of the second episode. -.-
Close Enough.
Friends are complementary to her personality. Besides, she stays cooped up studying all day. That is not healthy.
Depends on how you use it, Kraken
well
only one character uses it
he isnt in the group
he is the saloon keeper of Appleloosa
And with joining the channel, as did he the herd.
meaning
yeah
mainly fucking and cocksucker
HUSH
Dude
oh
whoops
It's PG in here
is this pg
I MEAN
/flees
I was asking for scholarly advice!
havent you ever seen deadwood?!
no
ok but keep it PG. thanks
those words are hardly foul... they're poetic!
yeah my bad lol
I don't make fanfics, but I can tell a good one when I see it.
03uh
03something like that
but
the one character curses like a sailor
MOOOO
Yeah, and is there anything else that's as high leveled as that?
Movies allow about 3 F-bombs before they cross over to R.
no
no like gore
or sex
only like the implication that sex occurs
not like, descriptions

he's busy. mad busy
Is it urgent?
06Yes
xD
but like
it's getting bigger than 5000 words >:
which isn't good
I know it's quality not quantity
Now they've asked me to ask people for their input over products and such.

I need to rewrite Reminiscence
/me facepalms
06And when you point out that the word doesn't mean the exact same? Then you are the uneducated one. But yeah, just pet peeves. details are good, but there are something such as overly detailed :P
I don't think my fics are overly detailed
06Nah they aren't
but I start repeating events
which is shitty
and makes it boring
like defeat
Yeah
quiet! i cant take it!!!!
I'm going to have to rewrite Reminiscence at some point
the first part is crap
and also
I posted criticism on one of Haii's "new fics"
she deleted it shortly after

I'm doing good
Pretty well here.
i just finished a fanfc
writing*
good thanks.
Tosxychor: wait, that's you? :o
my third chapter should be posted later today
that fic series has ended
I'm just doodling some analysis on the mane six
o
plus, if that's not clear, no I'm not that write friend that wrote those 6 stories :p
goodnight
It felt way too far off character
!todo list
too much to do ;;
I enjoyed it for the fact I wasn't really pretending those were patterns the actual character would fall into
!todo del 2
characters*
yeah, it was for me like reading of some familiar OCs
yeah
!todo
Syntax: !todo [add|del|list] [item]
!todo list
lol you have the same prooblem with typing
!todo del 2
I enjoyed the writing tho, and the last chapter was kinda nice
I didn't bother readingthat far
There's plenty other good fics anyway
no way one can read them all XP
Yeah I have 13 in my window tabs right now
hehe, LOL
10Back
10Thanks
I have to look that on up
mainly how high the quality can be kept for all this time
i agree, but there are a few that are not that shippy
Then again, Luna has no characterization which allows the author to get away with it
In b4 Luna is made a valley girlfor s2
Like To the Nth Dimension is really good
nah
i heard it before
. . . . . .
oh
i feel silly
I really like The Night that Never Ended
yeah, I enjoyed it too
for some reason whenever I try to read that fic, i can't continue it
just can't
I have a file in my favorites list justt for fics
I hear there are super-venomous spiders all over Australia
orly nao?
not just any fics, but pony fics
Yarly lightumbreon
heh, they do have snakes too
cute little things :3
the domination I mean
dur
hurr
/me shrugs
anyway
I'm going to go
yeah, a pilot-like episode or two might be worth it
And Luna a valley girl? really?
Wierdplatformer: if they go archbased maybe ...
Shai, I'm Affably Villianous.
^ more like harmless villain
not very friendly
lmfao
I'm gonna kill you... WITH TREES! OOooOOooOOooo
but evil
birlds + arms = ...? http://www.iywib.com/birds_with_arms.php
hmm, that would make it too important a character
*bitds
ok cut the connection with spike
we don't want it coming back after that first appearance
with bad intentions
uh. yeah
I don't know a good arch would be cool
Reginald Spalding should come back for Season 2
http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/uk_no_horseplay_348190.html
no that would be awful
If Luna's episode doesn't include me insome fashion, I'll be sorely disappointed
more*
no thanks
hahahaha
EXCELLENT
I am back.
that would be something else
That's a terrible idea Shaico, It should clearly be more along the lines of that fanfic Progress
Fireant'salive!
XD
And then I was gone.
CYA LADS.
yes abacus
I thought everyone had read progress.
i don't think they'll give Luna an abacus
yeah,if they don't cameo an abacus in the luna episode, I'm gonna be disappointed
if they did, people would be saying "Oh they took the idea from the fanfic!"
O
maybe they should include it in the background
like a tip to the hat to the fans
yeah it's not like it's the most adorable luna fic or anything
:3
It's a shoutout
a subtle one
oh i thought you meant a non subtle one
Hey a lot of the fanfics would be great ideas for episodes
yeah, just like the first derpy
like Luna actually holding the abacus and focusing only on it like the fics
:3
it should be in the background when luna is in shot.
or such.
yep
yea
going to spend the weekend at grandma's
that would make me fanboygasm
laptop already there, going to cycle to her now
i'll be back in a hour or two
me too, I admit XD

Already converted 1/4 classes

YEA!
*brohoof*
NEIGH
woooo
I don't think they're allowed to use the names we've created for background ponies.
they already have
pfft, they can do whatever they want
derpy is like an official character now
aw dammit
but the official name isnt derpy :p
he'll lift the band eventually
http://literallyunbelievable.org/post/6128970249/it-is-scam
Chill out shaico
they can't do that it's a fanbase collective decision
how can someone even clain they named someone something?
Actualy, we dont know the official name, "Ditzy Hooves" was mentioned in winter wrap up but there has never been any cannonial link between her and our derpy
crap
er
Faust
bbl watching MLP:FiM

or Derpy
pfft XD
i mean
wait
nvm
fail
stop pretending they're stupid
lmfao
Derpy's already been given a nod of approval to be canon when they aired feeling Pinkie Keen, don't you pay attention to anything?
where did she even appear in the show?
I just realized I wrote cannon
kaBOOOOOOM
plus being confirmed for s2
Well they can do their thing, but they can also take those ideas from fanon and evolve them
damn connexion
the very first one
first ep
hmmm...ive never noticed it
in the bgd
except, of course, for MUFFFIIIINNSSS
Derpy as a delivery mare became canon the day she dropped a piano, an anvil, and a wagon on Twilight's head
hmmm, lemme check on that
Derpy's voice actor isn't listed
but Derpy has novoice! <_<
i wanna see it for myself

ALso, Derpy have one line.

chap 3 should be up later
yeah I read ch2 as well
the premise is kinda cool
the mane six were also pretty in-character
Did you see the comments?
can't say I did
13!espeon

Do you have one?
not yet, no
but I'm getting familiar with the environment at least XD
lol yeah
hanging out in EquestrianStudy, proofreading a thing or twp
writing random things for fun
mods are asleep
06:3
post ponies!
Are we now?
XD
relativl
y
post ponies nevertheless
yeah, since the mods aren't asleep, the ponies may very well be
cuteness overload!!!
That soundboard needed 20 samples per character, not 10 XD
agreed
well, I rarely check on upcoming games, for three reasons
understandable
I'm more of a console gamer myself
just less complicaed
stupid keybord
now I'm in college :p
:p

hello goodbye to you too
well Ill see you around
see ya o/

(It's a music class)
Definitely something to atten then :)
attend*
PONIES
indeed.
PONIES EVERYWHERE!
there won't be enough until world domination happens
I just wanna curl up next to Fluttershy and not have any worries.
but that's not the point, going out of home shouldn't be a worry
I would get pony plushies
But I'm broke
And spending money on Yugioh
And my waifu
Soo
sew one yourself, there's plenty of guides on the interwebs
>me
>sew
it's not that bad XD
I am not very
*falls asleep listening to more ducktales*
Skilled at those sorts of things
plus think of all the pride once you finish it
I'm sure they'll churn out official ones anyway
Problem is
If I get one, I need the others
It's a completion-thing
!ping
!ching
!boink
I'd also need one of Twilight
~
~
the more of them you want, the more convenient becomes to learn yourself to make them :p
pinkie?*
Heheh, yes. :3
perhaps I may consider this
It would also be a boon to my waifu
I hope none of the Pinkamena are murderer...
examples gingerale?
Looks like this one is free. /celebration
Tosxychor have you seen Gurren Lagann
Seriously
But instead of being hyper and loud as fuck, he's laid back
all kinds of awesome then :D
And also whatever word someone catches on IRC would be newsworthy for a site like that.
I havn't seen or heard from him since early April
that is, probably after/during S2
DUMBLEDORE DIES
:O
(so does dobby)
The fact that he suddenly went poof like that concerns me after watching Gurren Lagann
As I'm sure you are aware of Tosxychor
!espeon
heh, yeah that could spring up worrying thoughts
I told him, I told him that the only way either of us would die would be by growing old together or backs against each other, swords and guns ablazing
.jpg
would there be aliens to kill?
but you haven't heard of him ever since? is that even possible in this era?
...
ok....
To be honest this isn't unusual. He'll randomly disappear for months at a time
And then the motivation of a thousand suns happens
LMAO, that's great
I still worry when he disappears like that
contributed some to the pony crusade yet?
Oh it's just always a possibility
(yes I ship them)
/me RUNS
He's gotten into some dangerous situations in the past
Oh, I see.
dangerous sports, or f-up situations?
That and I watched Gurren Lagann
For someone smarter to talk?
*Kamina
F-up situations
oh
Lemme guess
Drill
And Gurren Lagann
BREAKERRRR
Then he told me that story where someone shoved a gun in his face
a mugger?
cuz he got between one of his friends and a gang member trying to collect a debt
I swear his sense of chivalry is going to get him killed
I hope he's going to be alright :)
Hello
xD
Eh, he's fine
I'm not giving him enough credit
nothin much xP
