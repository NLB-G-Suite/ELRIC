SpeedyBolt: Good luck.
Shizuka: wait dis was on?, I don't recall hering it once

Thank you Shizuka!! :)
Flutterchu: It's late, you attentive bombchu!

00,10do you agree that sorce engen has turned gorden in to a 400lb man
13will need to go in there later and try a different save, maybe skip it if i have to
13the jumping is horribad ja..
/me wonders what black mesa is all about
(i guess no one wants to see it :'()
Flutterchu: Is there a reason for it being so late tonight?
00,10not only the jumping
So many Steam friends playing Black Mesa recently ;~;
00,10his collision box is too wide
Excuse me fellas, I need to go get my weed....
/me still needs to beat half life 2
00,10it's free Ponies47, so long as you have HL2
Good night everypony. Candlejack. I guess its time for me to g-
are you sure you dont want to see my fanfic cover
13thought it was free period
night Rex_Mundi
00,10needs hl2 to run
in his youth Gordon Freeman like his sweets
13requires source sdk
file:///Users/Cary/Pictures/Tord%20comes%20to%20Equestria.png
Source SDK base 2007
Flutterchu: Welp, to keep the streamchat entertained as you please, it's your turn.
I've been thinking about getting B3...It looks cool.
flutterchu: you linked a local hard drive link...
13don't think the sdk requires you to have a paid source game since it comes with tf2 and alien swarm
Sumica: I don't. I just have TF2 and Terraria. I really should find some other games to play.
Plus you don't have stream powers.
00,10you can try and get black mesa
13also the questionable ethics 1 track from the ost is the best
XAX: so it's not showing?
00,10it was amusing to get an acheavment by throwing TP at a guy
Goldeneye souce <3
source*
13stream's free btw sumi
XAX: what do you mean hard drive link?
13unless you're too busy with BM :3
00,10oki Shizuka
Sumica: I found the hidden hat. Carried it into the final portal. Didn't get the achievment. datfeel.
flutterchu: I tried linking to that kind of a link once when I was younger, but then found out it didn't work that easily.
wassup
13does it say carry or maybe you have to throw it in?
00,10I will stream in a bit need to catch up with the evenings activitys
Noob709: is there anyway i can show it?
Awwww. I missed movies tonight D:
00,10more like you missed the movies yesterday
flutterchu: May have to use a fanfic uploading website. You can try 'fanfiction.com'.
Not really. It was Day After Tomorrow again, just Rifftrax'd.
Sumica: Oh?
Noob709: im not done with the fanfic but im done with the cover
swa swa swa
flutterchu: Oh, it's an image. Photobucket?

I was going to make this fanfic about Edd (instead of going to heaven he comes to equestria)but I was afraid it would dishonor his death (besides his character is still alive) so i wrote this about Tord instead .There's also a mistake in here (a few chapters later the rest of the eddsworld team comes there outside as you can see out by the window Matt is riding on Fluttershy and she's acutally with Tord,luckly i made Fluttershy and T

00,10there are alot of pmv's with songs from this
00,10the only good thing to come out during the holywood writer strike
Hai everypony :)
Hello PinkiePry
00,10iDrive
e
Hey PinkiePry
Yeah
Chat is dead
00,10it's a love story about villan to be meets girl
00,10how is he useing a touch pad with gloves?
R.I.P chat. :'(
:D
Shizuka: That song you linked made the fight in the lab beyond awesome.
13ikr
13i barely made it my first try, then realize there was a whole section of the lab i hadn't got to explore, plus that achievement for the experiments
13so i started the chapter over, didn't regret it when the boss fight kicked in again :3
13still haven't got that fifth experiment though..
00,10I presume it's later in the game Shizuka
Hey Everypony! :)
00,10hey DerpDash
Hey DerpDash
Hello DerpDash
13i assume it's in aquatics but on the second go i still couldn't do anything there but purge with the tesla coil... and it didn't give me an update for it like the first tesla coil with the bullsquid
Bye Bye everypony.
Sumica: Questionable Ethics. So yeah, bout 2/3s of the way through the game.
bye Aircrafter
Bye Aircrafter
00,10ah ok
Bye Aircrafter
Shizuka: Did you eventually find it?
13not yet
00,10I just got past the pointless room full of big boxes
13got the other four experiments though
00,10the one that used to have a bottmless pit
Shizuka: Yeah, I got 4 without trying really. I'll be going back through the game on hard soon for dat challenge, so I'll have a good look then.
00,10and yes that is Mal from Firefly
I'm stuck on the end of Blasting Pit
dam felecia day can do everything
13unless the last eperiment is cryonics, but not sure what you should do there other than purge once to set the brutes free, then again to kill them and the soldiers
Kandarihu: :o Blast Pit ain't thaaaaaat hard.
13the tentacles in blast pit are a bit tone deaf after you get back from one of the generators, they don't seem to react to grenades as much
13you just have to try to dodge them
They're easier to dodge in BM:S than in HL1.
They hurt me even if they come anywhere near me.
In HL1, you let go of shift for a second and they're right in your face slamming their noses into you 5 times a second.
00,10they have to be seeing as gorden is now 6 feet wide and weighs 450lbs
13isn't it obvious
13gaben freeman
00,10hahah
00,10but wait gaben still has his ponytail
13sellout...
00,10heheh
Gaben isn't a sellout.
13i love all the lampshades in the first chapter
00,10so is it bad the first thing i did is hit the fire alarm 5 times
13and the post resonance cascade level... gave me chills
He didn't sell Valve to EA when they offered.
Shizuka: dat elevator ;_;
They cause moderate damage from indirect impact and darn near lethal damage from direct impact.
00,10then throw trashcans at every one
13i felt bad after pushing the alarm once cause the barney actually got chewed out for it
13old barney just sat there and glared at you
13it's a shock, NPCs that actually have personality
Shizuka: The 8 years was worth the weight.
13and the banter, i love that there's banter and interactions with NPC followers, even the barneys and scientists took up resting positions when i had to leave them behind at the elevator shaft
00,10did you catch the bit where the guy lost a bet cause you showed up for work Shizuka?
13jaja and then he's suddenly "busy" with a flat panel on the supercomputer
XAX, worth the weight, lol
00,10if you walk away and then come back the guys like I am so geting a piza for lunch
00,10then the guy that lost the bet mutters somthings
00,10they have a few of them
13indecipherable muttering... incomprehensible blabbering...
00,10but then again I was also busy playing stack the trashcans on the guys head
How much of this are new to this version of the game?
00,10I took a screen shot of it
00,10I had like 6 cans on the guys head
lol...
00,10then I procided to try and throw trash in to them
Sumica its kinda like megamind?
Are there stream?
13i heard a few sound effects from riven scattered around
XAX, yeah there's a stream.
13though i'm sure it's just a common effects library
No YouTube linking for me, then.
13like the er'cana platform in uru being used as the drawbridges in l4d2
00,10they should totaly make HL2 in sorce next they can call it black mesa 2
I don't know why but I can never take Gabe Newell seriously now that I've seen this: http://derpy.me/vxSFM
00,02oh i c
13imma say it, black mesa puts episode 2 to shame
00,02this is that thing
00,02neat ^_^
00,10yep Phase4
13episode 2 has nice big outdoors environments.... which you zoom through at 50 miles an hour in a car
13that and the endless endless antlion tunnels
00,02AdamTheDuck, wat
o.o
goddamn antlions
00,10i will forever say fuck ep2
00,10first off cause *spoiler*
I see. This song is from HERE, and THAT is the meaning of the lyrics "show that horse"
00,10secondly cause i took that fucking gnome all the way through the game and forgot to close the hatch
13eli getting the bridge dropped on him.. and sure it makes sense for that point in the plotline, but still
13for it to just end there with no resolution in the forseeable future
I'm sorry Phase4, but I cannot explain what is happening in that picture.
00,02AdamTheDuck, i'm not sure anyone can
I just... I don't even.
"It's a good day to be homeless" *shudders*
13black mesa actually makes it feel like you're a random theoretical physicist fighting for his life, half life 2 makes you out to be god who just happens to know science
For science!`
Killing zombie headcrabs, for science!~
00,10the one free man
Shizuka tbh after the events of hl1 you are kindo a god in the eyes of some
00,10makes you wonder how any one even knows of gorden
dat pillow :D
13and apart from being the one guy who makes it through a TOP SECRET UNDERGROUND FACILITY
13how does anyone know who freeman is... seriously
00,10well to be fair in HL1 I was a god.
00,02Sumica, i'd say its because he killed a lot of people but basically anyone who saw him died so...
Shizuka: On a completely unrelated note, top comment on a half life 2 speedrun. "Spends his time before combine invasion studying physics. Spends his time after combine invasion breaking physics. Gordan Freeman ladies and gentlemen."
13that's the one thing black mesa is missing now that i think of it
Well it's past 3:00 AM again so time for bed. Good night everypony and Sumi thanks for the stream as always :)
night Ponies47
13black mesa needs a breen cameo
Goodnight Ponies47
Shizuka some of the soliders survived
00,10"I hate the homeless. *changes card* problem in this city"
The vorts where freed by him
A reworked Xen
13vorts might have done it
Some if the science team know the full story too
I cannot wait for Xen. Wonder how long it'll be...
00,10kinda funny to me how every one hates the jump system in blackmesa
Barny for example knows most of it
00,02from what i've read, half life's story was made up as they went
13the whole combine invasion is a pretty gaping whole in the half life chronology
00,10to me it's like normal
13it makes sense sure but you never see it play out in-game
00,02Dumorimasoddaa, barny told everyone, problem solved
13one minute you're bumming around xen and blow up giant floating baby
13the next minute it's 1984 and combine are everywhere
00,02g-man did it
00,02read: magic
Well, jumping works fine for me, unless I'm trying to reach something that's higher than where I started from.
Shizuka you one got frozen on time by g-man till he needed you again
00,10ever see the combine guys youtube videos Shizuka? done by the same guy that dose mind of freeman
00,02i've not played through hl1 or black mesa
00,02probably should
13civil protection? love those
But bridging gaps is fine for ordinary jumping
00,10yeah
13especially the aliens one
13simba the strider
00,10yeah
00,10I might have to stream some mind of freeman
13especially especially when they whistle close encounters of the third kind at each other
13it's over like 8 hours now i think
00,10sounds about right
Shizuka: Here's how I see it. After Black Mesa, Breen somehow took control of everything and took a whole bunch of people and turned them into his army and some of the others into stalkers or whatever.
13the canon story is the combine were sitting in some third alternate dimension behind Xen, and installed Nihilanth there to keep the vorts in line
13humans blow open a rift to Xen, Nihilanth sends vorts in to do vort things, freeman comes and blows up Nihilanth but doesn't close the rift to earth
lol.
13the combine tear through Xen and use the Black Mesa rift to open superportals elsewhere on earth, and take over in seven hours
Should I look away from chat because I haven't played hl2 yet? :<
oh noes did i miss season 3 episode 1?
Ooooooooooh. 7 hour war.
I see now.
my: yes you did
13breen makes a deal and becomes administrator of earth, combine stop slaughtering everyone and opt for enslavement instead
sad face
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
my : :'(
13even then though... the combine war strategy is pretty dumb.... apart from using stalkers to build their war machines, there isn't like a line of supply back to the combine overworld
so if i followed this right, neil patrick harris has the hots for some whore that jumped captain hammerass's bones?
Reproduction was dead until Gordan shut down the thing that stopped it.
Dr. Breen is evil though
00,10more or less Buytoast
oh, she's dead
well than that's good
00,10yeah she got hit by shrapnal
13yeah the humans would have died out entirely within 40-60 years... what exactly was the combine game plan after that?
00,10his dethray got damaged and when hammer went to use it it exploded
Shizuka: Earth all to themselves? Party.
downer
13the moral of the story is the combine are idiots, but we knew that, because you can fool a metrocop into not seeing you by holding a palm sized box between your eyeballs and him
00,10and then the world outside portal 2 makes snece Shizuka
Shizuka: ...really?
13yeah, i did it last time i streamed hl2 even
I have to try that.
13that one metrocop by the floodgate, with the mounted gun at the end of a long platform with boxes to hide behind
13you just pick up a little bit of debris, hold it right in front of your face, he never shoots
00,10behold, badhorse
13it seems to only work there, probably because he's on the gun, the rest of the soldiers in the game aren't usually as dumb
i have no idea what is going on
13or have backup so you get shot anyway
Is this how it ended?
00,10yep
yes
13but it works there because the way the metrocop determines if he can see you is it casts a ray from your eyeballs to him, and the debris blocks it
00,02jed whedon?
00,10whedon's are like kerbals
13anyway enough dumping core... sleep time
A relative of Joss Whedon?
nini Shizuschlafen
brother of Joss mayhaps
00,02XD
00,10IT croud, dats a good show
dat tardis
00,02night Shizuschlafen
00,10so how about some mind.
Speaking of mind, you can find brains on the ground in some places in the anomalous materials lab In BM.
Among other body parts.
00,10this is the only freman voice I will be ok with
Ah, Barney
znight Shizuschlafen
Wish there was a way to watch stream from my iPod.
/me watches stream on ipod sometimes :$
woah what is this
HL1?
00,10Freemans Mind
this guy's commentry is funny XD
good morning everypony!
00,10morning somepony_else
Morning somepony_else
hey Sumica and AdamTheDuck
00,02this is wierd
XAX: hold on
00,10what is Phase4?
00,02this show
00,10you never saw mind of freman?
00,02Sumica, nope
that blistering reply speed
XAX: get the app Photon Flash Video Player, may i say that sometimes it takes awhile to get app to work
Interesting to see what it originally was like
XAX: also its $3.99
:3
00,10this is not quite it Kandarihu
00,10this is the remake one
HL:S?
00,10yeah
Source?
I see
00,10but it's mostly cosmedic
Sumica : is this on youtube?
Doesn't look that different from original to me >.<
XAX: never said i payed for it <.<
00,10yeah but I am not playing it from youtube
00,10it looks better AdamTheDuck
00,10love this song
But then again I haven't played Half Life in a while
Sumica : can you play the intro of the new WOW Mist of Pandora?
dat song
the mists of pandaria intro is dissapointing
i didnt think so
the first half is pretty nice
but then it turns into kung fu panda
and not just because there's a panda
Buytoast : i find it funny because it has a bit of Kung fu panda feel to it
lol
i know XD
i just find it dissapointing that it goes from the survival grabbag free for all into a light hearted whimsical panda smackdown
00,02lol, those old processors
lol
00,02i had a cyrix
00,02worked ok
XD
00,10tended to explode
00,02i didnt use it for long
00,10Gorden is best disgruntled scientist
Gorden Frooman
00,02>disprove string theory
impossible
00,02that would be neat, string theory isnt exactly being usefull
Phase4: Sum up string theory please.
ooh, freemans mind!
This Gorden sounds like Homer Simpson
00,103 strings and some twigs and you can make a bow
:$
00,02XAX, http://xkcd.com/171/
was he teleporting or shifting dimensions/
Phase4: Awesome.
Oh no, I must've missed one
ive stayed up for 4 days stright and i was fine
kinda
6_9
no your not freeman
Half Life?
my: Skill.
Black Mesa is free?
00,10yeah
yes
But do you need to buy Half-Life 2?
:P
00,10just need some bits of sorce
00,10it will auto install them if you have steam
I have TF2 which runs on source, does that count? :S
i for one had to torrent it
00,10direct download for the win
00,02Limbo
omg just yes
Trally pokemon.........really?
Phase4: were you describing the chat there
00,10stick face in cats face> get nose licked
sandpaper
hey look its the chiken the dictonary and the potion brewer
chicken*
00,10sounds like a disney movie
:D
Anime twi
00,10miss clicked
Oh so s3 discussion are forbidden
lol
i cant find episode 1 anywhere
00,10of?
s3
00,10because it's not out
Not out yet.
i heard it was out yesterday
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Somebody told me it omes out on the 24th, I dont belive them
Nope
00,10you were lied to
i heard it came ou on the 15th
Lies :<
out*
00,1024th is a monday
Between 20 an 23rd
Lies and slander.
oh yeah good point
11,02Speaking of 24, that's close to the number 25.
Yes and
00,10the hell you say
11,0225 represents the number of GBs that Wii U discs can store up to \:3/
Where is BerryPunch? D:
11,02GB = Gigabytes... not Game Boys >>
Oh hi NewSuperBronyU, I got an upgrade from AJIsAwesome|Asleep
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/397/538/be6.jpg
11,02XAX: Oh God...I don't think I could be crazy enough to rest my head on that...
00,02NewSuperBronyU, ah, so its blu-ray
11,02Phase4: Not Blu-ray
00,02its blu-ray :P
Oh sweet sweet gaben. I'm glad you're watching over my dreams
11,025x the transfer rate of Blu-Ray :)
00,02they'll be doing the same thing they do on the wii
you make me such a heavy sleeper
11,02So, it's better than Blu-Ray :3
00,02ALLMOST identical disk, custom drive
NewSuperBronyU: Who wouldn't want a gaben pillow?
00,10so it's a blueray with extra buffer time
11,02It's a custom form of DVD...probably HD-DVD in a new form >>
goddamn geldon fordmun kills alot of people
00,02NewSuperBronyU, it will be very near blu-ray because thats whats cheap to produce
11,02HD-DVD was cheaper to produce than Blu-Ray
11,02Nintendo confirmed it wasn't Blu-Ray
00,10of corse they did, cause sony owns blu ray
11,02Indeed, but they're not going to be dumb to use Blu-Ray and force users to install games just to go up to the same transfer speeds as that of DVD.
00,10yeah they had to go with faster speeds to make up for the lack of diskspace
11,02However, it's 16x that of DVDs and 5x that of Blu-Ray, so it's a superior proprietary medium that's closely related to the architecture of DVD
Good morning :)
So that everyone knows I am using a chat client on my phone so I can't see the stream
Morning to you MaxTheBrony
Heya AdamTheDuck :)
11,02You can plug any drive you want into the Wii U and it will work Sumica.
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i do know its not hd-dvd, those disks had a higher cost to store 25GB than blu-ray and the drives were slower
good morning MaxTheBrony and audiosurferbrony
hi somepony_else :)
11,02Then it's something new with DVDs they are using because it isn't Blu-Ray.
11,02It's much faster than Blu-Ray
00,02the only benefit that hd-dvd really had over blu-ray was reuse of the old dvd infastructure with nearly zero modification
00,02big quotation marks around the 'nearly'
00,02NewSuperBronyU, if it actually is a custom disk then neat but it'll increase game cost
00,10the controllers cost 150+ I dont think they care of cost.
11,02Phase4: Maybe so, but it will give the high capacity drives that Blu-ray has while speeding up transfer speeds so you don't have to install games for it to load normally.
$150 for a controller? o.o
^^
so much blue
11,02ikr
i mean if they didnt supply the 3DSXl with a charger they proboly arnt going to su-pply the game with a controller
console*
Ah gravity, thy hearthless bitch.
wow, really? thats stupid
I take it back, this looks alot better than original half life :3
00,10hehe
Goodmorning people :)
Morning MLP_Brovakiin
I remember the first time a watched this....
morning MLP_Brovakiin
mornin'
00,10again this is the only voice I will be happy with for freman
Does Gorden ever speak through the Half Life games?
nope
Gordon*
00,02PHYSICS
11,02Moo o.o
00,10the box motion?
extreme hotscotch
00,02Sumica, yeah
00,02doesnt look scripted but it could be
00,10it's HL:S
00,02ah
I have a question. what does black measa have to do with apreture?
00,10rival companys
competitors
^
00,02what is it with people and thinkign you can light the atmosphere on fire
"I don't want to set the world onnn fiirrreeeee"~
^bacause it is made of paper and cheetos
take enough heat and everything will burn
00,10cause o2 burns
*because
I dunno about the atmosphere, but I'm sure I can lgiht you on fire Phase.
light*
00,02Dark_Horst, not everything burns, and theres a difference betwene raw combustion and a sustained fire
00,02Jmo, o_O
well, at elast the atmosphere has oxygen
;D
Doesn't fire require fuel as well as oxygen to burn? o.o
00,02D:
gordon mclain
00,02AdamTheDuck, the idea is that the atmosphere itself becomes fuel, but these people dont get chemestry
dat chemistry
00,02i cant spell
:>
fire needs fuel oxygen and heat
and an ignition event :P
00,02there are ways to combust without oxygen, plus a bunch of chemicals that ignite only on contact with each other
00,02wiki has more info than me
00,02i'd be checking wiki but gordon
00,02dr newell
ikr
00,02if only you had some kind of.... prying bar
he has a heavy class curriculum
00,02you could open the doors
^ if only if only~ :D
Good morning Bronysta- OMG FREEMAN'S MIND!!! 8D
00,10I like how he plays off some of the things like the suit protects better
00,02XD
00,02gun inside vent
I love this series!!!
Good mornin' Gold_Demona
00,10and he shortcuts alot
Wait... Doesn't HL:S have a beretta pistol replacer?
Instead of a Glock
00,02Crikey
From what I understand, they made their own models for all the HL1 weapons.
All the ones that aren't in HL2 anyway
I haven't played far enough in it yet to know for sure. :P
Hey guys i think the youtube guys did something wronge
Haai Gold_Demona
Hi Jmo
:D
00,02PONI
00,10So phase did you go tell build a bear you want pony plushies?
I can't wait until he finishes Freeman's Mind. When he does, I'm marathoning the whole thing.
00,02Sumica, no actually, leme go do that quick
Sumica: that would be awsome!
MLP_Brovakiin: are you here?
00,02i'm in australia so hardly makes a difference for me

krazy: They are competing companies
Hello everyone :)
For Klumzeedragon wants to see it, MLP_Brovakiin

00,10ikr
thank you <d3rb>
00,10no luna either
What's this about a Buildabear survey? 6-9
I can't play Half Life 2 anymore without thinking like this version of Freeman. The last time I played my husband and I were making snarky Freeman's Mind-esque comments everywhere. XD
6_9 *
oh it is wonderful Gold Demona it's not like most Brony websites -__-
00,02"
00,02Build-A-Bear Workshop could have My Little Pony characters at our stores, including Spike the Dragon. Or, we could have the dragon and unicorn shown above. Which do you think your child would be most likely to ask for, if any?"
00,10now link the image of the unicorn
00,10it looks like a g3
00,02http://www.buildabearsurveys.com/surveys/542885338/1e08cebaimg090.JPG
05filetype jpg/image
00,02also their spike alternative: http://www.buildabearsurveys.com/surveys/542885338/1e08cebaimg089.JPG
...they even ask that?
:< wat
da fuq
good lord,t hat is hidous
00,02lolololo applejack
00,10yeah Dark_Horst
how hard is it to get the g4 look...really
00,10no d3rb, that's the one they they can do.
Does anyone know where Rainbow Dash is?
00,02gordon is ninja spai
well they should try harder
g4 or not that thing sucks
00,10they are wndering if they can get away with out having to pay for the lisence
Spike alternative? What does their original Spike look like?
I imagine they'll get the G4 look is they actually decide to add FiM toys. Which shouldn't be a hard decision with all the bronies doing the survey. :P
if*
is no one gonna answer :(
00,10they can get the rights to make ones that look like g4
00,02its gona be wierd when 18-22 year old males start flooding the workshops
00,10but they would ratehr save cash
00,10I would totaly be one if I was't 903
Rainbow Dash's profile Gold Demona
00,02memememememe
00,02ohai barny
00,02i think thats barny
Barny clone number 329
00,10they all look like him
00,02guards need nametags
ALL guards look like Barny
00,10remember though Barny was locked out
Barny's busy trying to escape in his own game.
00,02Gold_Demona, or is it barny that looks like all the guards
Phase4: Hmmmm
deep
00,10wonder if we will ever find out what happend to sheppard
00,02sheppard commander or different sheppard
00,10adrain sheppard
00,10as in the opposing force guy
00,02ah
Maybe we'll find out in HL3
00,10he was put in to storage the same way gordon was
00,02Gold_Demona, so what its like the ultimate question
Sumica, are you sure this is Source? Gun model looks the same as original. :<
We just know he got the same G-Man treatment Gordon got
00,02cant find out or the universe will end
:P Hello everypony!

I mean NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
Nowhe is drumming!
see you all later
:(
Seeing this makes me sad now
why?
Bye Moder- oh well
I was about 80% done with this game
But then
FLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
And now it is scrapped
damn
Oh Phase4
00,10flash eat your vidga game?
Vordox: Shake your fist at it angrily and start over?
Nah Sumica , Sound API issues(Delayed sounds in rhythm game?)
dat foal in one
00,10ah yeah
00,02Vordox, send me some code?
00,10figured that was gonna happen to yah
Phase4: Anyway, I checked up HTMl5, i still has a delay of up to 30 ms
00,02hmm
When hearing can nootice difference of 7 ms
Phase4: It's not code issues, it's a core issue. :P
Vordox: you talking about an xbox?
No :P
Flash As3
00,02flash cant do real time, regardless of what adobe says
Phase4: It can be faked...but faking sounds causes..."naeusous" :P
00,02i would sugest java but i actually tried to write something in it today
00,02it actively resists programing
Phase4: I'm looking more and more at C++ or C# :P
Atleast that should be quite doable with sounds, no?
00,02yeah, your probably stuck with native/near native right now
00,10and with this I PTFO
00,02SHOO BE DOO
Piss the Feck Out+
just make lots of siezuristic colors flash by and no one will notice the horribad everything else... see any anime
?
Thanks for stream Sumi. :3
00,02we need g4 seaponies
Or Peace the Friendship Oribit?
00,10yeah we do
Agreed Phase4
00,02inb4 s3 has seaponies
00,10I would love the drama of that day
There'll be no Sea pones :P
00,10just think of the caht reactions
00,02it'll be derpy all over again
00,10chat*
it's bacon and applejack!
LOL Ikr? XD
00,02except there will be more people
00,02so more spam
00,10night all
bye sumi
Night Sumica
good night sumica
00,02night Sumica
bye Sumica
Night Sumica
night Sumica
Goodnight Sumica
I wonder....
I'm gonna check GML langage
See the sound latency on it
Ello
Ello there everybrony.
Hiyo Malavolent
Hello Malavolent
/me has seaponies stuck in her head.
Phase4: If Game Maker has good loading of sound...
I should've grabbed it first
But I don't know how it handles Vector graphics of Mysterbyben
00,02i wouldnt trust game maker
Yay wakeup call :D
Phase4: Why not?
00,02never liked those kinda things
00,02with purpose built languages
Phase4: It's where I started my prototyping
:P
And I still use it today
Haven't stopped me in my tracks yet(I only stop when I have to stop or build around)
00,02for prototyping sure
ALSOOOO!
00,02but a full game?
Phase4: It has Sounds being put in memory for instant call back
Phase4: Ther'es plenty :P
LAWL
Dem faces with the song
00,02Vordox, you only really have one sound though
Phase4: One Sound?
00,02the song
Oh no
00,02just need to keep animations in sync
There's more then song
00,02patcher is broke still
I'm making a fully coded game
There's at top 5 sounds at one time
(Which Flash fails miserably per each added instance)
00,02why so many?
It's a game :P
Like SweetieBell's Ooo, the sinw gsound, the hit/miss sound of the Club and the Ball Flying sound
swing sound*
Flash can handle itself on ONE song...
If in main Timeline, otherwise.. Coding to start sounds = bad
Phase4: We need more music!
Put on endurance? :D
00,02this is broken
broken :<
00,02i cant do 4x symetry on the wings
00,02which is disapointing
00,02i want to build this plane :(
Too complex for emulator :P
I wonder Phase4, what do you mean by native code?
00,02Vordox, compiles to machine code
Ah
Basically, messing around with the software/Hardware itself
00,02well no, it runs in userspace
00,02so no hardware access
Aww.
It should help with the sound latency right?
00,02well you get access to the native audio api's
00,02which have either much lower latency or latency controll
Depending of if I can store the sound files into memory
That's one of the solutions, I just go to know HOW to do it
The callback from internal machine code should be quick as heck.
00,02Vordox, you can get them into memory easy, infact firefox does that, the 30ms is coming from elsewhere
Hmmm
Great, more digging! :P
But Phase4 , I'm thinking of it being actually played on the machine itself
Not played through a server/Proxy
Boom :P
00,02Vordox, theres no server/proxy when running stuff in javascript
But I can't do java.
One of the languages I have yet not even drilled into
But I think stand alone sounds better imo then run through a website, Better and faster(I assume atleast) For quality gaming
And hey, if it's a good system it might be warranted to be increased as well :P
00,02Vordox, the thing about html5 though is zero barrier, you navigate to the game and it works
00,02i added more rocket
00,02this might work now
Phase4: Inb4 Short flight
Phase4: Yeah but the Sound API of HTML5 still causes a delay of up to 30
While aiming for 7ms is the most ideal, or less
00,02Vordox, where did you get the 30ms number?
http://cromwellian.blogspot.se/2011/05/ive-been-having-twitter-back-and-forth.html <-- One of the sites, let me find the other
00,02lets play readalong!
00,02also i read fast
EDUCATION BOYS
(And girls9
Yay I can feel myself being edumacated
XD AdamTheDuck
My brains! They creak! D:
Like an old rusted machine that hasn't been used in a very very long time!
00,02this seems complete enough
Gold_Demona: That long, eh
Vordox: Yes, my poor poor unused brain. D:
Very neglected
Gold_Demona: Quick, watch more ponies
I know! I'll watch Lesson Zero and see how Twilight uses her brains! :D
00,02ah
00,02i see
00,02Vordox, so this stuff isnt implimented
00,02but it is the api you need for real time audio
hey guys
Hiyo alexxm
Oh!
Link please.
how are things Gold_Demona
Is this the part of the HTMl5?
Or you reading Java?
00,02Vordox, http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/
00,02html5
Pretty well, alexxm. Thanks for asking. And yourself?
00,02this rocket needs more wing
Hello alexxm
It needs more cowbell
Phase4: It says Javascript at the top. <.<
00,02Vordox, yes.... javascript is part of html5
hey AdamTheDuck
Phase4: Oh...
So it's double language hybrid
Goodnight everypony. :) Thanks for the stream Phase4.
00,02Vordox, html5 is not a language :P
00,02it a set of standards that happen to include javascript
I thought it was :P
00,02night Klumzeedragon
Just like Flash was AS3(With Java mixed in)
heh is that a Phase4 OC coding and building rockets there?
Night Klumzeedragon
00,02eyup
Something exploded
lol awesome
"noone cares"
00,02staging fail
/me licks AdamTheDuck before scittering off
Funkballs: Check the thing he is watching
It's US
RIGHT NOW
/me has been licked "Yay" :3
lol he's checking irc?
so any succesful missions today
pulled up too hard lol
Haha :D
need some vertical flexibility
Phase4: This is alot to read...
brb
or an elevated runway, at the very least
Let's see if I understand 1% of it
yay~
boo~
front flip :P
00,02the problem is my computer cant handle rocket of this magnitude
that sounds like an anime quote
Dat lag lol, thought it was just my stream lagging
Phase4: So it seems that HTMl5 can be close to real time as possible, while still being in a browser?
MY COMPUTER CANNOT HANDLE A ROCKET OIF THIS MAGINITUDE
see
00,02Vordox, it can be realtime, all browsers these days have incredible javascript engines
00,02full on 70% native speed jits and everything
Phase4: Explains why Java is the leader atm.
00,02java o_O
/me pretends to know what's going on 6_9
just for lulz, you should make a rocket shaped like the space core.
Java has some of the more powerful coding attributes, doesn't it
?
00,02javascript > java
uh oh...
Javascripts are made in Java? <.<
c'mon, rise....
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Yay explosions
HE LIVED
i like how it came out of lag just to frop to the ground
00,02Vordox, javascript and java have nothing to do with each other
ded
Nope :D
deds
00,02the name is because of this buisness deal that happend betwene sun and netscape some years ago
UUUULTRA ded
i thought it was 3 kerbals in this game
Oh.
No wonder the confusion ><
00,02the intent was javascript would be 'training wheels' for java
>.>
LAWL
This outcome
00,02which is all well and good, except javascript is BETTER and MORE POWERFULL than java
vordox, how long can you go before pulling up? it might be better to just gradually lift out of the atmosphere.
I'm not the one driving the game
It's Phase :D
00,02adasdad, i'm flying :P
fail
Yeah I'm laughing at the outcome of how it was meant to be, Phase4
i knew that, but my brain didn't :p
Phase4: Well that makes it easier to understand thanks.
Silly brains. :P
too much lag, it hurts my eyes 3:
Good morning Bronystate! :D
Phase4: Oh friends wanna play some games. I'll poke you later if I get into more information, Phase4 =3 Thanks alot
00,02^_^
Bye Vordox
Hey Gold_Demona :$
how are things MadSurge
Hiyo MadSurge. =D
Hello MadSurge
AdamTheDuck: I'll still be here
In case anyone wants me(HAHAHAHAH WHO WOULD?! Hahaha...hah...)
/me gives Vordox a lick o.o
AdamTheDuck: Eww much?
:P
Gold_Demona: are the Survival-Hard levels hard in Plants vs Zombies? :D
MadSurge: They can be. I eventually managed to beat all of them, though.
/me kidnaps AdamTheDuck
/me escapes and runs into alexxm's cage for time sake :3
Gold_Demona: Two rows of sun-making plants, a row of magnet-shrooms and a line of pumpkined Tallnuts always help :D
00,02wait a minute
MadSurge: Definitely. Having pumpkined everything else also helps.
00,02if i launch from the spaceplane hanger
00,02i dont have the tower to worry about
00,02BIGGER ROCKETS!
MadSurge: In the survival levels, I like to pumpkin EVERYTHING
Gold_Demona: :D
MadSurge: Also upgraded spikeweeds
Gold_Demona: still haven't reached that need
MadSurge: And cattails the pool levels
MadSurge: I LOVE cattails
I saw bigger rockets, will that mean bigger explosions Phase4? :D
MadSurge: they're expensive, but they're worth it
Cattails are awesome! WOOF
inb4 explosions yay
MadSurge: The trick with the survival levels though, is that the upgrades cost more and more, the more of them you have. :C
and he lives...
The Kerbal survived? D:
Gold_Demona: Well I got to 9990 sun in the first hard survival level :D
MadSurge: That's good. XD
Gold_Demona: got the "sunny days" achievement
MadSurge: hee hee hee
Gold_Demona: also the wisdom tree is growing only in height now
MadSurge: In the later levels, when you have SO much sun, it's okay to replace one of the rows of flowers with some artillery. :P
MadSurge: You get it to a hundred feet yet?
05yay my guild has its 2 year anniversary today x3
Gold_Demona: only thing I can buy now is Wisdom tree food and the rake :D no, it's lije 56 feet
Ohai Wrek
*like
What guild?
Hooray, Wrek!
05wow guild
Hiyo Wrek
05hi Gold_Demona!
00,02ohai Wrek
MadSurge: Always buy the rake whenever you can. :3
WUT
Lolwut :D
LOL Wut was that? XD
AND HE LIVED
How is he ALIVE?!?
OMG And he's happy
He's like "AGAIN!!!"
00,02stupid uncontrollable rocket
Yay imminent boom incoming
00,02yeah, lost one of my control surfaces
00,02that tends to cause problems
The Kerbal's going nuts. XD
And ded
00,02i dont blame him
well this kerbal seems happy
00,02oh damn
00,02should have waited
Holla everypony! :)
Hello GilDash|Reading
Hi GilDash|Reading! :)

Ooh!

Hello Emil
Hello AdamTheDuck!
How is everyone?
Chat is 'really' quiet now :S
Dat Avast
: O
Wait, this song.
The party music?
CCC theme
Oh.
CMC*
Remixed?
00,02D:
ded
00,02TIME WARP Y U FAIL ME
Kazoos :3
Well...
00,02and it was going so well
Is it just me, or is his design getting more and more complicated?
00,02hmmm
00,02one more?
00,02Emil, well my simple ones work
Phase4: What do you mean simple?
Emil, if complicated means adding bigger rockets, then yes.
AdamTheDuck: I meant more sophisticated design with new interesting aspect, unfamiliar to me.
AdamTheDuck: But bigger rockets also work :)
Why so much Sellyme? 6_9
*aspects
And if that don't work, use more rocket.
Yep.
If it doesn't work, blow it up!
The MythBusters way.
If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing~
Exactly.
Oh God, so many rockets :D
If it doesn't work the way the myth claims, then you declare it busted and keep upping the ante until you get the desired result.
And then you keep going until something awesome happens. XD
Gold_Demona: Which usually is a giant explosion.
Emil: .....True. :D
Favorite explosion is cement truck.
Gold_Demona: I mean, who doesn't like giant f***ing explosions in the name of science, right?
Emil: Ikr?
00,02why does my music keep breaking
But what about the diamond explosive compression episode? :<
AdamTheDuck: That was cool.
How much TNT was it again?
AdamTheDuck: That must've been a later episode. I don't remember that at all.
More than the cement truck one iirc xD
00,02so
00,02same rocket
00,02but with more rocket
lol
I stopped having cable years ago.
Just with more rocket xD
You're doing it right!
Did something just break?
Appropriate music is appropriate
lol
Awesome music.

Pink3Phone, it's $15 I think, not too sure though,
there's a demo though
MadSUrge: If you have, I've forgotten. I'm very good at forgetting things. 6_9

Hello OtakuTom
:$
hia OtakuTom :)
Hey, OtakuTom. Long time no see.
I've been lurking a little more frequently instead of actually chatting. My schedule's changed a lot these past few weeks. I'm actually awake when the Angry Dayball (AKA the sun) is up now...lol
OtakuTom, I've been away for a while too. Good to see you, though. ^_^
00,02well
00,02here goes nothing
00,02bill is totaly gona die
inb4 explosions yay
its good to see you two back, the last month I looke at the chat and though "people are talking... but they are just not the same peope like 3 month agao . _ . ... what hapened?"
Lol. Ikr. Things change pretty quick around here...
Good to see you again too, Lil_B. :3
not that I want stagniation XD, I just noticed that back when I joined, Gildash, otakon, meanwhile Twi_fi and Airpuff were usually the ones talking and now there were other regulars XD, it's was just the realization that stunned me XD
Well, you know how all the RPer's kinda moved over to the other room. >_>
That's kinda part of the reason.
yeah :/
Eh. I just keep all the rooms up! ^_^
00,02sorry bill, i failed
Yea, I did kinda notice the lack of /me comments recently...lol
So I'm still a regular like everyone else. ;w;
ded? :<
just got some more free drumsamples, reminded me I wanted to rerip the Samples from the SNES games -.-
Ded. :(
OtakuTom, the apparent RP war stopped when a accidental solution made itself known.
lol
I usually have both open as well, but I always forget to open Dashiesauce up XD
Erm. >_>
Maybe a funny Half Life 2 mod will cheer you up Phase4
Ninjazz I know, don't worry, I know what I'm doing here -.-
Ehh, it's a youtube link >.<
Glad someone does. ^_^;
Dat Yakety sax.
Lol XD
Ninjazz thats why i didn't wrote the "#" infront of it :P
Hehe, this song
And then Yakety Sax :D
lagg
haha...it looks like it's flapping XD
Lil_B, well, I want a certain mod's attention and I'm not sure how he'll react if he even jsut sees the name. >_>;
Don't want*
Ninjazz in the last week a lot of people for some reason linked the channel, yesterday even scoot-scootaloo as an exident XD

Passable. Mostly passable.
Ninjazz: just go in Dashiesauce and laugh at the RP? :D

There's one major downside to the stream ending...now I have to actually TRY to stay awake while at work. There's no chance of me dozing off while the stream is up :P
Hurry, OtakuTom! To YouTube!
Yesterday wasn't very awesome for me :P
How come?
Being mad at Mike sucks.

OtakuTom: i can help you stay awake
He is my senpai
But he doesnt actually come here
Here we go...MysterGuitarMan's latest video...Dubstep Power Tools...lol
He deleted Skype again yesterday and it was the worst time he ever did because he was gunna use Skype to have guest commentators on his let's plays and I was gunna be one of them
Did he delete it because he was upset?

Chrysalis, I feel for you. ;_;

6_9
also, spending £600 on computer components made me feel better
^_^

Yea, he was really stressed yesterday cuz he's been working on his room o.o
Ahhhh moving.
Chrysalis strikes me as a female
because i have the urge to flirt with Chrysalis
Lyra` you are incorrect
LOL
:(
:D
no lesbian flirtiation then?
:(
Chrysalis: Holla! How're you doing?! XD
GilDash|Reading pretty good minus a lack of internet
Chrysalis: So I've seen. All good now though?
GilDash|Reading nope
He did that on purpose.
Good morning everypony :)
Cypresswolf: Holla! :)

Ohai Chrysalis! Do you like your new apartment?
Also hi Cypresswolf!

his room?
:)*
yeah, internet is a PITA till thurs
hia Cypresswolf and thelonepony :)
PITA?
ended up buying a new phone so i could tether better
Pain In The Ass
Chrysalis: I don't like tethering. Costs me an absolutle fortune. :S
Ohai, Cypresswolf.
and then there's this http://www.ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm - this will update on monday and will be gone forever as they dont archive the filler strips :)
GilDash|Reading yeah, but its better than no internet at all
Yea
This week, a classmate checked which chemicals are in the garage, and he did it via a voice recording... I said I could try to make a song out of it as a joke... neow he sned me the file and I try to make the most over the top techno-Stuff I can do XD and I don't even like the genre XD
tl;dr
like the game?
what is up with my text-walls latly !!!!
or his actual room?
Chrysalis: Not when it ends up costing you £80 on top of your normal contract. :D
his actual room
GilDash|Reading for internet
i would pay that
Chrysalis: Not worth it in my opinion. :S
3 weeks wihtout a decent connection is killing me
I'm not made of money! I need it for things, like fuel!
yeah, i got a job for that :D
work is awesome
Lil_B is cute, funny, strong, smart, an independant black woman who dont need no man, charming, charismatic, likable, swift, beautifull, and oh so perty
Incorrect
text walls :D
Erm.
Chrysalis: So do I. It just happens to be 13 miles away.
lol, im only 9 :P
Lyra`I think you missed absolutly none of all the things I am not Oo I'm stunned
Lil_B so you do need a man?
rawr?
also not pertyt
or a woman, Lil_B?
perty*
Chrysalis nope I'm a man who needs a woman in that case XD
and I don't even know what perty is
Pretty.
so very purty <3
(\^w^/)
Chrysalis: It'd be alright if I didn't have to go to Yeovil every so often. That's another 50 miles away. -_-
In good ol' Sooth 'Murika lingo.
huh, whats with all the black-mesa playtime
Ok, show of hands. How many actual girls to we have in the chat right now?
/me raises hand

Yep.
lol
I like diamonds on mine.
Ninjazz: Sparkler?
Who?
00,02GilDash|Reading, probably rarity
WHERE?!
There are women on the internet? That's in direct violation of the rules of the internet!
Phase, shouldn't you be asleep?
which were written by men!
Phase4: I'm teasing him. I know full well his fetish for Rarity. ;)
00,02Jmo, i probably should
>_>
damn men, thats why i stick to women.
00,02ohai Chrysalis
00,02GilDash|Reading, ah
Hai Phase4!
:|
Again the word fetish. >_<
it's a goddamn obsessoin.
Obsession*
NOT A FETISH.
Ninjazz: You're the one obsessed. :p
00,02"its not a fetish, its just an obsession"
trixy fetish :3
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. D:<
Trixy fetish?
must be talking about meanwhile
NO.
RARITY.
Phase4: Yeah, it's not really worth trying to reason with that one. XD
Ninjazz: more like favorite pony worshipping, eh? :D
AH! Weeping_Angel in the chat! D:
anypony else have a hoodie fetish?
Trixie's Meanwhile's thing. -.-
Gold_Demona just look at it, youll be fine

MadSurge: Just happens to be in the bedroom too...
Don't blink. O_O

00,02pony_1896, wierd stuff is going in in the chat right now
really
Bluh.
I'm used to it by now.
wierd things?
so, lets psychoanalyze someponys dreams
Run while you still can.
in a chat for males who like MLP?
Ninjazz, tell us about your dreams
say it isnt so
yo
00,02Chrysalis, no wai
hey
Lyra`, sometimes... I dream about cheese.
good to see you made it :)
Ninjazz: Can you even remember my ponies? XD
really
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
:(
GilDash|Reading, you have ponies? o_O
my ponies are nsfw :(
My dreams are few and far between. I dream maybe once a year?
00,02pony_1896, you keep using that word, i do not think it meens what you think it meens
NOT SAFE FOR WOOONA!
00,02and then the anon left
Woona is best pony
my t-shirt says so
00,02not sure if we trolled or confused him
Hey everyone. I'm trying to make a ponysona for my husband, but I can't seem to escape the overused "yellow/orange/brown pony with brown hair" color scheme. Any pointers?
Oh. I don't remember my dreams. And the only time I remember a pony in my dream was sorta out of context.
Woona is best Princess
i love to confuse people
its fun!~
Gold_Demona, use white.
Gold_Demona use blue!
zomg black and red scheme forever~
:O
I'm back.................from my mom's computer...........
Use white AND blue.
hi
wb Dark92Enigma :)
hmmm, i wonder if i have enough bandwidth to play some TF2
hia Dark92Enigma :3
No stream, i suposse?
I want to keep the brown hair, but it's very difficult to find good colors to go with it that haven't been done a million times. =\
I *was* Rarity in my dream, once. 'Twas awesome. ^_^
hate you so much.
:|
Gold_Demona: GREEN and brown?
i had a fallout equestria dream once
Am I the only one in this chat who never had a Dream about MLP in his 1 year of watching the show?!
i killed SO many zebra
Ninjazz: 'Twas at the spa to. Lotus and Aloe were there. ;)
Lil_B, I just said I wasn't.
then i healed them all and placed them into my thrall
Lil_B: Nope
GilDash|Reading, of ffs.
Anypony else has it's chatroom space .........................a little reduced?
Ninjazz oh... sry :(
Ninjazz: Got to get back at you somehow! :p
GilDash|Reading, next dream you have better be you (Rarity) and Rainbow Dash. :|
Wish I wasn't so failtastic at using these color sliders. :(
Ninjazz: ... Alright, that's up and over the line, Ninny.
Well there goes the weeping_angel
we can blink now
-_-
Whew!
GilDash|Reading, there's no line when your flying over it.
Chrysalis: I was doing that already. :S
o-o
Lol.
Ninjazz: I'm a unicorn. I can't fly, silly. :p
Gold_Demona, you can create an amazing comic but not use color sliders? >.>
GilDash|Reading, somepony else can.
Ninjazz: Oh? Like who?
Jmo: My sense of color theory is suxxors. -_-
GilDash|Reading, that's for you to dream about.
D:
Gold_Demona: now that I think of it, ever considered doing a ponified David Xanatos? :D
Jmo: The colors I use in my comics are all made using eyedropper tool.
Ninjazz: I don't dream you cold-hearted bastard! :'(
/me hugs Ninjazz.
Cheeaaater ;~;
MadSurge: LOL, That'd be amazing. I don't know if I could do it, though. XP
GilDash|Reading, .......YOU. HAD. ONE. DREAM. TO. RULE. THEM. ALL.
/me hugs GilDash|Reading back. <_<
Gold_Demona: goddammit Xanatos, just LOSE sometimes will ya? :D
Ninjazz: Yeah, but no Spitfire. Or Braeburn. Or Rainbow Dash...
Jmo: Doesn't help that my PC's monitor is SHIT for displaying colors.
AGAIN, does anypony else has it's chat rpoom space.....................reduced????? Like...................a quarter of what it used to be?
:P
GilDash|Reading, irrelevant and unnecessary. You were... her.
All them un-essential dots.
<adSurge: LOL, IKR?
Ninjazz: You and Rarity? That's like me and Spitfire, okay?
MadSurge*
last year I spend way too much on a new Monitor and now I'm running it on economy mode (50% less power) all the time XD only tuen it fully on when I'm watching a movie
and again..................chatroom space reduced for anypony else?
nope
not at all :3
I'm on a client, so no space issues here
Ninjazz: for a birthday pony thing, I got to swap bodies with Rarity O__o
GilDash|Reading, bleh. I'd be fine with being anyone or anything as long as I get to see a Rarity.
Even Fluttershy.
I'd be fine being her.
I'm at my mim's computer.......and IT'S REDUCED TO A QUARTER
Ninjazz, i think youre beautiful the way you are
Even though I dislike her.
Yea, I'm using a chat client here, too.
and everypony loves you equally <3
Mom's*
except me
Ninjazz: I'd just like to dream again. Like, at all. That'd be nice.
i love you moar!
Lyncast, I think you need to clean your glasses. ;_;
hold on, 'll refresh
Dark92Enigma: maybe it's on the flash settings?
GilDash|Reading, I wish I could remember any of mine.
MadSurge, lucky bastard. >_>
Ninjazz: Have/remember. Same thing.
NOPE. for any random reason...................my chatroom space is reduced
ugh, have that feeling in my chest that tells me i need a hug.
/me hugs Lyncast
Better? :3
thanks babe :3
<3
GilDash|Reading, so we're in the same boat.
Ninjazz: in another, I went to the moon with Pinkamena though :D
Ninjazz: No. You've still got a 1up on me. :p
shibaru this is my buddy
MadSurge, I had one where I married Spike. >_<
GilDash|Reading, Barely.
Ninjazz: Still counts. :p
/me hugs Lyncast.
Ninjazz: :D you poor thing
Because hugs, gurl.
MadSurge, ;_;
GilDash|Reading, ...barely.
Seriously, my last dream must have been in... April? And before that, probably the previous June or something.
Ninjazz: Still. Counts.
I never dreamt ponies :P
^
The one I can barely remember was out of context.
I was a detective. Meeting my chief and his assistant.
My chief was my younger brother.
I haven't hada a dream that I can remember in years >.>
His assistant. Celestia.
She didn't even say anything. ;_;
I need to get back to learning how to lucid dream again.
hi
hey
no!
are you new here? dont think ive seen the name before
rawr
Si.
lucid dreaming is scary
I've been on SF for about 4 years or something, but I haven't been very active lately.
It can be.
oh alright
Very much so.
But I think the gamble is worth it.
glad you could join here though, we are trying to revive this place
Bring scary on. I like to entertain scary.
i love lucid dreaming
you have to go through a bunch of Endermen in the hallucinations
so... naughty <3
My imagination's strong enough as it is awake.
I would lucid dream to go to Equestria though
Yeah, I read the topic and thought to see if anyone was in here at the moment:P
My mind was only able to kickstart during math class.
lol
Day dreaming was fun.
Just a couple of us right now
it is ^
Now, I'm too relaxed to do it anymore. =_=
Ironically, when I "day dream", my mind actually goes completely blank. I literally do not think of anything. I have to focus to do what most would consider day dreaming.
well, I don't do it in my Mechanic Materials class
I didn't recognize your name either... how long have you been here?
I usually sleep
2 years I think..
I never joined the forums
Now all I do is think.
whats so scary about lucid dreaming it sounds pretty cool to me
Oh, that explains
because of the hallucinations you have to go through
alexxm, your mind is a seriously dangerous place.
Ninjazz: You say you're relaxed but you think all the time? :p
I prefered the chat rooms
GilDash|Reading, is that impossible?
Meh. Hallucinations are alright if you can handle them.
Ive joined forums in the past and just dont really post
when I'm relaxed, I think a lot
Ninjazz: It's not something that tends to go hand in hand. I think all the time and I know for sure I'm not ever relaxed. XD
You see. There are other things to worry about.
but I think of unnecessary things
But I think it's best that you not know about them. The less knowledge you have about them the better.
GilDash|Reading, perhaps relaxed is more equal to slow in my case.
Or... meh.
I 'unno.
They do say ignorance is bliss... haven't got time for ignorance though.
Too much to get done.
wait a minute, trying to find the meaning of bliss
ah, I understand
Happyness. Contentedness. At peace.
... I swear a bird just flew onto my window.
I rarely post, and even more rarely come and chat here
The utter opposite of peace.
Are you still into the spyro series?
Ninjazz: Bliss is the utter opposite of peace? Funny, I would have gone with agony or something.
GilDash|Reading: *splat* birds are dumb :D
MadSurge: It's only a pigeon. I don't like pigeons anyway.
I meant a bird hitting a window.
Hey, Nitt.
Ninjazz: Oh, yeah, that. XD
Nittany_Discord: Holla! :)
Hey Nittany_Discord
Yes. Mostly the originals. Haven't got/tried Skylanders.
sup Nittany_Discord
Hey Ninjazz.
Hey GilDash|Reading and Ponies47.
hi Nittany_Discord
And OohShiny and thelonepony.
So much greetings.
skylanders is ok
Well, it's a slow day thus far.
Yep.
its good that spyro didnt die out completely
hi sheep
But right now I'm waiting for Spyro to come to the European Playstation Store so I can play them on my psp, so I haven't played a while.
hi
it's morning, I doubt anyone would wake up just to watch the stream
It's almost 3 o'clock over here.
played in a while*
whenever i hear/read the word sheep i think of spyro hehe
It's Monday morning.
Gold_Demona: shit, now they're throwing gargantuars at me! D:
It's 10am Sunday over here
Ninjazz: Where are you from??
MadSurge: Oh, you mean those HUGE guys that throw tiny guys at you when their health reaches half?
Yeah, the spyro sheep is iconic:P
OohShiny, near Japan and Guam. We use Austrailia's timezone here in Saipan.
MadSurge: I hate those. :<
Heya Nittany_Discord long time no see, how ya been?
Gold_Demona: yep, in survival mode
Surviving.
MadSurge: whatcha playing?
MadSurge: Yeah... They need dead fast. They take two squashes to take down.
Gold_Demona: and they even resist one hit kill plants!
Are there sheep in skylanders?
yep
its funny too, they make a lot of comments about sheep
OohShiny: Plants vs Zombies
MadSurge: Squash takes them down to half.
the characters talk about how mysterious they are
MadSurge: Tater mine is instant though, I think.
do they still serve the same purpose?
MadSurge: now that's a good TD game
haha
no
you can still burn them though
ram them
Gold_Demona: isn't there an even worse version of them later? :(
but they arent for food anymore
MadSurge: No, I don't think so.
hahaha
MadSurge: Oh wait, yes. The berserk ones.
MadSurge: They only show up in survival mode.
Gold_Demona: woohoo :(
Gold_Demona: well yeah, I finished story mode :D
MadSurge: They're not so bad in most of the Survival mode levels because you only get like one at a time, but in the endless mode, they are your death. =/
Gold_Demona: at least I made it to 10 waves in I, Zombie
I love that one. As well as the breaking pots one. =D
I think I made it up to 20 in breaking pots once.
Gold_Demona: the breaking pots is too luck based D:
MadSurge: Kinda. But if you know how to manage it, it's fun
MadSurge: I always start with the right two columns so I can start putting shooters there as soon as I get 'em and not worry about the jack-in-the-box zombies.
Gold_Demona: is the final minigame just the final boss fight?
MadSurge: Yup
the arizona sunrise this morning http://i.imgur.com/Yenhs.jpg
MadSurge: It's the final boss on steroids.
the final boss is fucking awesome
I love the final boss. =)
Gold_Demona: oh boy, you mean winnebago attack all the time?
I like that the final mini game is the final boss because I can fight him again without having to do story mode again. XD
is that smog? it looks a little hazy
MadSurge: LOL, no, but he DOES use it more. XD
compeutor derped
nope no smog here at all
am I the only one that likes the creepy music from Flutterex?
Never heard it. :P
does look a little blurry though
what makes it blurry?
could be out of focus?
that's probably it
Are the other Pop'n'Cap games fun to play?
MadSurge: Peggle. I love Peggle
ohai pony pepple
What's that?
Do you know how Plinko works?
Ohey, Ish.
Gold_Demona, Peggle is fun.
so who won the lottery?
I didn't. :c
But... Hmmm.
Gold_Demona: it looks like a weird pachinko thing
MadSurge: It is, but the object is to use the ball to get rid of all the pegs.
is that the thing from the price is right
Did anyone catch who won then?
And instead of dropping the ball, you shoot it out of a cannon.
anyone, anyone at all?
MadSurge: Peggle was my favorite PopCap game before Plants Vs Zombies came out
Erm. I just remember the movies.
Especially Peggle Nights
Space Jam.
Is the B.
Ninjazz and teh A
...I was too tired to remember. -_-
Trying to remember... >_<
Space Jam?
:(
Gold_Demona: well, good thing there's a sequel coming eh?
wee, Looney Tunes!
MadSurge: There is? :O
I would go open the log, but I'm afraid it might break.
Gold_Demona: yeah totally, Plants vs Zombies 2
MadSurge: Eee! Awesome! :D
Gold_Demona: yesh :$
Ninjazz anything yet?
Hang on, I'll go check.
was Looney Tunes: Back in Action ever streamed?
nope
Something SURREAL happened to my plasma TV
Obsidian, Galaxy Quest. A movie
pinkie destroyed the 4th wall?
and then destroyed the tv?
It's now getting louder and softer BY ITSELF
MadSurge: Bookworm is also a fun PopCap game. =)
First pony ep is Bridle Gossip, Lord Derpington. (How does this guy ALWAYS get picked?!)
LOL i wish Pinkie would break the 4th wall LIKE THAT
BUT NO
What about the bubble mayan themed thing?
And B movie was Vampire Girl Versus Frankenstien Girl, Riders.
PillowPoni|church
MadSurge: Zuma? Yeah, that one's fun too
Installing sims 2 again, wish me luck 8)
Instead, the volume goes ON and OFF ny ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE IT WAS POSSESED
But since it's a gorn movie, we changed it to Space Jam.
BY*
And somepony_else got Family Appreciation Day.
For the second pony ep.
Oh goddamnit, Ish, you left already.
And now................when i try to adjust the volume, it goes MUTE. AND I'M NOT THE ONE MANIPULATING THE CONTROLS
MadSurge: Also, Bejeweled. Very addictive.
What was the A movie and Pony episode A
?
Gold_Demona: you mean Beghouled :D
I missed it
for the next week*

Alchemist, we should make Internet illegal or something. D:
Dark92Enigma: lol, I had a TV that did that too. It also chenged all of its settings like putting the color WAY up and putting the balance WAY to the right.
Dark92Enigma broken Driver, or other Sowftware. Do you have Skype open?
Dark92Enigma: So I turned it off and left the room, and it turned itself back on. :P
Dark92Enigma I'm just asking because Skype is nowing to play with Audio and i-Net settings
knowen*
Ninjazz: nope, Im far too addicted at this point. the detox process would kill me :D
Alchemist, then we're already doomed. :c
Might as well be happy about it. :D
alexxm:idk WHY it's happenning, i have to accept it's happenning JUST LIKE EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE FELIX THE CAT MOVIE
Gold_Demona: how did you fix it?
odd Dark92Enigma
Dark92Enigma: Nope. Bought a new TV. We were wanting to get rid of the thing anyway cuz it was from the 1980s. :D
Gold_Demona: what's it like? Flat screen?
Gold_Demona: My tv is a PLASMA.................how come it's happening to a RELATIVELY NEW TV?
dy you there

Dark92Enigma: I don't know what to tell ya. =(

In the corner
Woot woot
Just enjoying my weekend, I have to because I hate the place I go to during the week. So did anypony catch that new Resident Evil movie?

DerpyMuffins What was what? what are you talking about?
I was drinkin some juice and I noticed the expiration date on it was my birthday... .w.;
Yay slow chat

hi AJIsAwesome
Heya AJIsAwesome, how are you?
G'day AJIsAwesome
ded
I dont think so
Ive been trying to contact him but not having much luck..
/me grabs the chat and shakes it.
He was here 4 days ago..I think
Once chat dies it takes alot to get it back
Where? on that pokemon server?
/me defibrillates the chat
One of the two, most likely her own
Although she's probably on both
Still ded
oh she?
IIRC
do you go there?
/me revives the chat with stripping
Used to
Pretty good, MLP_Brovakiin! :)
hmm....
Not so much any more
I might try going to that pokemon server and see if shes there later today
Thats good to hear AJIsAwesome :)
and now i join Wrek and Sumica
08,01so... who's heard about this "Mohammad Movie"
alright
/me hhugs Gold_Demona Derpy_Hooves thelonepony and MLP_Brovakiin :)
LOLJUBILIFE~
Movie?
08,01i just watched half of it
alexxm: That didn't help, now put your clothes back on :P
DerpyMuffins......
You mean the one responsible for all of the embassy attacks?
LOL JMO
Not hooves
wub it <3
08,01and apart from the absolutely, and i use this word to its full extent, *insanely* inflammatory content and narrative, it's horribly shot and a chore to watch
08,01no idea how true that is
So, to sum up, it's a crap film with the clear design to rile up people?
'Cause that's what it's doing.
08,01GilDash|Reading: exactly
Well she's on her network, but probably idle
08,01MirrorImage: yup
evidently the producer was on probation already, so yeah...
Apparently there's been an embassy stormed in Australia recently over it.
GilDash|Reading - if it's Australia, i doubt it'll be "stormed" like the Lybian one was
08,01if its purpose was anything other than to piss off muslims, it was not just badly thought out, but a literally mentally derranged thing to make
08,01anyhoos
MirrorImage: I dunno... this is Australia we're talking about. "Everything in Australia wants to kill you" after all.
08,01it was on the front page of youtube
05at first i thoguht you were talkign about "the Dictator"
GilDash|Reading - yes, but at least Australia isn't a country where that film is illegal on principle
your on there right now?
10!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 6Tangela.
10no
morning everypony :)
08,01Wrek: the Sache Baron Cohen one?
MirrorImage: That's what makes it the more disconcerting.
10at least it's not tangrowth
08,01also, i have a sudden urge to dig up my cat that's buried in the garden, to see how the decomposition has progressed
...
That's...
08,01morbid, i know
.......
08,01but i'm really interested in seeing it first hand, from a scientific perspective
MirrorImage: I know that, but what I mean is it's disconcerting to see intolerance and hatred beginning to spread out everywhere.
08,01MirrorImage: just over a year now
08,01probably all bones by now
GilDash|Reading - "everywhere," or just everywhere with a Muslim population? Remember that this is really an issue because in those middle east countries, muslim law is national law
in Australia, it's just a protest
08,01that seems... misjudged.
08,01or, to be honest, maybe not...
08,01anyhoos
08,01pretty cool idea
u so crazy
Yep >_>

Bronysith: lol
I think the last time I read Progress was when Luna was working for the space program or something like that
Wrek: of course some skepticism is encouraged no matter if its pony news or political/world news :D
Wasn't there a drawfriend incident one time?
Wow, Wrek. A whole bowl? Not just a grain? :P

That's a lot of salt.

lol idontknow
Alchemist: :O
dem socks
AJTheMightyGamer: I don't know how to respond to that.............
^
lol
It's.... socky?
Gold_Demona: here people tend to fry the meats or make them as stew, but nothing like that
Good Moringing everypony
I hate Sundays.
I'venever tried stew. :$
morning Dovah
Too much procrastination going on.
hi Dovah
Alchemist: Well, here too. But we also have meat pies.
I hate Tuesdays.........
hi all
Yay I just successfully used the fryer for the first time \:3/
hi FlutterMEDIC
Hi, FlutterMEDIC! :)
ello FlutterMEDIC
Hi, Dovah! :)
streams?
Heya FlutterMEDIC
hi FlutterMEDIC
no Dovah
Alchemist: It's not nearly as common as grilled, fried or stewed, grant you. The pot pies are mostly found in frozen food form. :P
how are things FlutterMEDIC
alexxm: gud
I've never tried stew. :$
Stew is AWESOME. =D
08,01when i have children, and they ask me why the sky is blue, i'm going to explain to them about black body peaks and rayleigh scattering
08,01it's going to be awesome.
Gold_Demona: well, suddenly that doesnt sound so nice anymore...
hahah
you have to do it:D
Alchemist: There are recipes for it of course. I've never tried to make it myself, seeing as I've never even made a REGULAR pie before. :P
Let alone a pot pie...
/me yawns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTu2XPjB9tk&feature=BFa&list=CL8Fo_WBNo0Qg

LOL
I would love to try a meat pie.
Chicken Pot Pie. :P
I also like Turkey pot pie and Beef pot pie. :3
I'm just going to poot dis here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwjpbzDO0zM
I'd LOVE to try and make it homemade if I can talk my husband into trying it. (he doesn't like pot pies)
08,01did you know that originally, a pie was made with an inedible casing made of clay?
Hm........
Really? :O
Interesting.
its also funny, that we have pies too, but it looks completely different but with almost the identical recipe: http://derpy.me/9SUKF
Seems impractical.
ohai guys
Alchemist: Those look DELICIOUS.
we also have a pink pie, but that one is not ediable
Hi, Hipster-pony! :)
Heya Hipster-pony
hello
Hiyo Hipster-pony

AJIsAwesome: that is an apple pie actually, AJ would approve :)
08,01wait, slightly wrong
08,01it wasn't clay
hi Hipster-pony :)
Alchemist: Yep. :$
08,01but it was a really hard and inedible pastry
Apple pie, i like the food, not the ship

What's wrong with sixth form?
Phase4: Oy! http://www.taterboy.com/blog/2008/08/flash-and-javascript-communication/
I think I may have found something
The fact that only just over a week ago I quit mine because it was making me want to strangle everyone who attended it.
00,02Vordox, theres an old crap one and a new usefull one
http://youtu.be/SrYozJfVjnA
I'm not sure I understand this yet, Phase4 >< Just found it and new functions I've yet sen
seen*
00,02Vordox, i forget which is which but that one will work
Not to mention pretty much all my friends went to college or didn't go to do a second year, my school isn't capable of fulfilling an IT course like college would.
My school is good in terms of people who attend, just shit in terms of rules and traditions
Ah, it's probably way better than mine.
Grammar school, so no shithead chav wankers.
Or, not many at least
Yep
Way better than mine
But
The new year 12 was FULL of chavs.
>no lessons for entire first half of school day
>make you come in anyway
I know that feel.
I used to have 2 lessons straight in the morning, the rest of the day was free session
I had to stay in even though I couldn't do more coursework at the time.
That was until I started going home during my frees. still kept 100% attendance.
Haha
http://youtu.be/4DyauAgit0E
For me that's the best skit in the whole anthology
I prefer the weird Celestia walk and the Pony Quest segment :D
One of my favourites is the Elsewhere skit with the shooting stars.
"if you saw Pinkie's twitching tail 20 screens ago, you would have seen this coming". Perfect Sierra logic right there

Fun little game we shall as the buffer continue its wrath

The song inspired a very special song in the show MLP FiM can you tell me which one? http://www.repeatmyvids.com/watch?v=10AMqdJUcFY
Hahaha
but, alas, I'm no longer in a relationship
the battery is dead so i have to keep it plugged in, but the cord is glitchy and sometimes turns it off
so the odds of that happening are now 0
so that's why i've left suddenly a few times today
Ah, sorry man

The original song is from a movie called Hocus Pocus
you are scaring me
:~:
It's hilarious at times. Like the Unicorn episoode.
someone ping me when its over plz
Speaking of Supernatural... I have yet to see season 7.
Are you genuinely scared by this...?
correction. The youtube user that sang this version is katethegreat19
I can't wait to see children of the night being overplayed when it's done

Who is this guy anyway?
Umm
I have no idea whats going on
ear rape much?
I turned the sound off and the video stopped making sense. o_o
ofna01: lesson1 of watching youtube poop: ALWAYS watch at low volume
or rather rule 1
im laughing for real right now
this is a good audio remix lol
I hate the radio edit in this
I wonder if there's some sort of volume equalization thing that can be put in place to negate ear-rape.
FUCK YOUuuuuuuuuuu Fuck you and fuck her tooooooo
of this song I mean
Gold_Demona: like it makes any sense with the audio on
Kandarihu: I'm sure someone could do something about it if they were bothered enuogh
enough*
Kandarihu: just watch at low volume, thats what i do, avoided 99% of earrape
FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU
xD
Time for some Cider while this awesomeness is going on.
twilight_sprinkle, yes. My ears become more sensitive to compensate. But it's an extra layer of bother just because the maker of the video is a tad too malicious in his trolling.
D:
Kandarihu: yeah but theres almost always a earrape in ytp, its almost a tradition
aaaand then this
prince, i looked away and heard that
i nearly shat myself
/me shuts the fuck up :<
twilight_sprinkle, traditions in YTP? More like a cliche.
Oh, this one.
wat
Puzzle!
erm
heh, also my insane suggestion :P
um
what
i have no idea
idk, i really like this video for some reason
Scoot-Scootaloo: Can we send requests, or are you just having fun with random stuff?
and the sweetiebell seems fitting
send requests Klum
00,03I'm finishing up requests from ;ast time
Oooh. That was a long time ago.
Stream is best
everything in this video somehow seems to go together
Oh, was this my request?
Kandarihu: no i think this is mine
PEEEEDO
Japanese girl O__o
Oh, okay.
Why
Can you setup the topic Dari?
The
Hell
choppy stream kinda messes it up thogh
Do I recognise this music?
Scoot
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ah. :D Keep it up then~
I don't even watch weird Japanese shit

TOAST!
00,03Becuase... stream is imploding from all the WTF
00,03Also toast
00,03Also not yet
did someone take LSD before creating this?
I'd have to look up what it was
Toast powah with Sweetie Belle!!!!!
is anyone else getting a laggyish stream?
Probably. :P
Really, the fuck is thgis Pinkie?
And twilight_sprinkle, yeah, a little bit.
Somehow I think that Sweetie Belle was in the original video too...
this is what happens in the process of pinkie breaking the 4th wall
stream wants to shoot itself
my little pon pon pon?
um
and then more Japan
YAY, CREEPY AD

Slender is now andross
Im not to sure why, but I am in a really energetic and happy mood today :)
I'm not sure why, but I am really hungry today.
Scoot, all of these scary videos scare me
MLP_Brovakiin: good on you! :)
flutterchu: tord stopped apearing long ago... but i don't think tom will continue the show without edd
Maybe it's because I haven't eaten. I 'unno.
MLP_Brovakiin, your dog died just now
Up and down is just a matter of away from or towards the center of gravity.
CrimsonPhoenix: I dont have a dog :D
MLP_Brovakiin: It's cause Borderlands 2 is out tonight. :P Dance like mad!

I agree with ofna01. That's not cool
MLP_Brovakiin: Of course! :) Pinkies4thWall is getting it too. And someone else I think. So we'll have a nice whole group!

"Ubisoft has a long Tradition in making games with Nintendo"v ... yeah... I think the Wii was the first console -.-
some pooting
Im going to turn off my screen untill its gone so yeah
00,03Moopy, I don't tolerate people who complain

Moopy, don't be mopey
SERIOUSLY?! They cut the ZombiU Part out of the Video for the german version of the Video! WTF!
xD
:|
Lil_B: Everyone knows Germans don't like Zombies.
00,03Stu is best Engie
00,02Lil_B, i tried to work together a 'zombie nazies' joke but then started thinking about godwins law instead
00,02this is what happens when i no sleep
Klumzeedragon yes we do, but our Government doesn't... or maybe these people are just personaly offended by the way these people tread fellow Zombies
they've had ubisoft games on the N64, the NES the SNES, and so on....
whats Godwins law again? I forgot >.<
Lil_B: bringing up hitler in an argument
basicly
oh :/
00,02Lil_B, as a conversation goes on, the chance of nazies being mentioned aproaches 1
00,02nazies or hitler
Lil_B: As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1
00,02either way
Gah, you just beat me Phase4
00,02Unnr probably quoted it better
>_<
00,02i am the ninja phase
Lil_B: I know. It was a joke. I'm 1/2 German if that means anything these days.

im a quarter german actually

Why did the red button start the stuff?
you know... no house should ever be without nutella
i agree Ingwaz
My house is without nutella. O.o
i have 2 jars in my cabinet right now
Ingwaz a house without nutella is a sad house
so many years i went and never had it...and now there is a large jar in my home...and theres SOO MUCH OF IT
I'm back..........
hi there Dark92Enigma
and now i know what was wrong with my tv
so, allow me to expand my horizons, favorite uses for nutella?
Welcome back...........................................................................................................................
the thing is, it was located near a dryer
are we doing this now
Ing
i use it for toast
Engi you sound familiar
with using many dots
ofna02: thats what i've been using it for
ofna02: but surely there are other things it would go great with
Ingwaz I merely use it plain on bread or Toast
pancakes
00,02https://xkcd.com/1109/ i want one
its really good on pancakes
!pokemon
and because of the humidity, the keyboard got screwed up, and that's why the tv won't work
sounds bad bro
so i'm sorry if i unleashed my anger yesterday
Phase4, if I were to get a fridge like that, it would have to be tweaked a bit.
what did you do yesterday Dark?
00,02Kandarihu, adjustable roller speed or something else?
o.o an apple with nutella sounds amazing
ofna02: shout out my troubles in canterlock caps lock
More space for the '12 hours' section.

Now you've done it Angelica. You made Santa quit. D:<
So, the A movie was Galaxy Quest......what's it about?
Well, immediate openings for a new Santa.
Gold_Demona: are you watching Rugrats?
Dark92Enigma: its like star trek, if instead of taking itself seriously it was a comedy (and i mean the new movie)
Dark92Enigma: I'm watching the stream, which is showing Rugrats. :P
Gold_Demona: my stream isn't doing anything......
Ingwaz: Like... Spaceballs?
IT'S JUST LAGGING
Refresh?
00,03refresh, floozies!
And buffering
ok
00,03speaking of refreshing, brb...
Klumzeedragon: no, thats full on comedy. this is more like hey, its supposed to look serious, but its actually just for laughs
Rugrats
Klumzeedragon: spaceballs is far better than galaxy quest
space bawls
Still nothing......just buffering..........WAIT, IT WORKS
Barely
Oh and aw. :D Now I don't have high hopes for Galaxy Quest.
Hi, Good morning everyone
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT

So......Galaxy Quest? haven't we watched it on MST3K?

Monring TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)

you know...i wonder how tara got her voice like that?
Goodmorning TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Ingwaz: from what i can tell, she got into character
13!pokemon
!pokemon
Dark92Enigma: not sure if that was some sort of joke or not... hopefully she didnt wear a diaper
Ingwaz: good vocal range?
wow, appearently Nintendo is the Developer for LegoCity Undercover :/ anyway, Video is over now XD
Ingwaz: no, but according to her interview, she even sucked her own toes :D (she might be trolling)
MadSurge: that much is already obvious. its just impressive to see her be able to do that as well as its quite different from many of her other voices
ugh, script spam
Dark92Enigma: yeah....sounds like something she would say
of course
13ugh, drf complaining

nope

Tervicz: of course! that will enlighten us a bit
Do we stream ponies a lot during the seasons?
I havent been around here for a season yet. :D

If they get aired
Bronystate becomes very important at a premiere
I think we can beat the Royal Wedding views under the first S3
Applejack2011: if the first episode can top that off
WHICH IT CAN BE POSSIBLE
How many viewers were there for Royal Wedding? :D
Over 1006
:O
No, it's upside down
OVER 9000

Klumzeedragon more than 1000 iirc

Lil_B: whatever :P as long as you watch it, this movie is epic!
o.O

This sounds weird, but.... I miss my german dub of the Pokemon -.-

Gold_Demona: I love Psyduck, he's so goofy :D

Raichu, don't be a dick!
Dat Music
FIGHT
kidzrul434 Because Pikachu's the mascot of Pok?mon.
I GOTTA GET DIS ON YOUTUBE
This would have made an excellent silent movie in think
Lil_B Oh yeah i get'cha i think the danish dub kept all names but i can be wrong that they may have had a few changed names
eeeeeeeehhhhhhhh k
remember the Danish dub too killerpony it was good
00,03CAAARp
magicarp
ded
did magicarp use watergun
i think so
I remember watching the Danish dub. I laughed, I cried.
Mostly, I cried.
Looked like bubble to me
Wait a second, does this mean we are gonna see the *actual* movie that comes after this?
:D
i thought it could only use splash
killerpony7733 some were the same, but a lot had changed names, I only remember pikachu, new and newtwo to have the same names everywhere
Psyduck is a worthless pokemon. He never does anything
alexxm: It also learns tackle. :P
wut
These Transitions... WTF man?!
dat slowpoke
kidzrul434 you are misinformed.
GUYS! DISCORD IS THE NEW VILLAN!!
kidzrul434: i like psyduck...
Gold_Demona well aside from that
SNUBBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
kidzrul434: then again though, i have a certain love for all psychic types

HEY! BULBASAUR DOESNT KNOW CONFUSION!

Panda Gameshark!
kidsrul434: I shall correct you. MISTY'S Psyduck is worthless... other than when it goes nuts and does confusion and psychic to pwn everything. :P
I have never played Pokémon. This sounds like some sort of crazy moon language to me.
ohai Panda :)

rdibp switch training have it come out first and switch it out
hai Panda
/me nomz Panda :3
/me glomps twilight_sprinkle, "How are you hun?"

Kandarihu I ment when did you join today XD
kidzrul434 Same way everything else does. :P
kidzrul434 becausr nintendo thats why
rdibp O_o uh....
meowth
So is this the WHOLE movie or just the pre-movie cartoon?
14o.o
no, don't o.o me
Premovie
Panda: if only i could ever force myself to do that, instead i always wait til the last moment :D
MadSurge pre-Movie
Okies
premovie short
premovie
MadSurge: i think it picks up halfway through
yeah
Hey Panda!
i like how meowth is the only pokemon that actually talks
even on his day off mewoth gets screwed
MadSurge, hello there.
ofna01 It's explained why though
I'd rather not say
K.O.!
hello
ofna01: well, he learned to talk!
why killer?
I kinda like the Vocal Tracks, so late 90's (and these Transitions -.-)
Chansey! 8D
Ah
Oh, no.........Charizard. :D
Dat sleepy charizard.
ofna01 thts not true! We have a pikachu that talks!!
WAIT!
DAT ANGRY Charizard.
he just lost 10hp because of stomp
pikachu says Pika...
oh no
*sudden realization* meowth is chasing pikachu because its a game of cat and mouse :O:O:O!
the end he dies
SQUISH
ofna01: There was a Lucario that talked in one of the movies. And a Slowking in the second movie.
icwuttheydidthat rdash
Relaxo used Überroller
rdibp: -_(\ bad pun is bad
ofna01 translation of pika = sup boys pikachu is in the house mudabuckas
ofna01 He tried to say...impress a female meowth and at some point he stayed at a attic where he overheard humans talking and eventually learned to mimic and speak
xD
rdibp btw, that joke was funny in 1997
rdibp: you're right... i actually never noticed
dat train
Charizard has rather badass sounds
ofna01 But there are very few pokemons that can speak too
o_O
oh god they're everywhere
..................
/me dies X_X
KILL THEM WITH FIRE
/me revives rdibp
killerpony7733: but except for Mewtwo they all suck
Meowth taught himself how to talk to impress a female meowth who wound up dumping him afterward cuz now he was a freak. :P
We will end his suffering... bring the Rifle!
zuul mothebuckers http://t.co/cM0LlSGj ZUUUUUUL!
That girl meowth was a spoiled bitch anyhow
Lil_B: Oh, that's terrible. :D
ofna01 But meowth learned it through actual training and discipline by himself of course
Gold_Demona yeah... but at least he can talk. If anything I think Meowth should be a stronger pokemon because of that.
AJIsAwesome it's the only way! THE ONLY WAY!
:'(
cachi01|phone: You know, For kids!
He defied nature to become humanlike.
THE END
poor charizard :(
poor charziard :'(
awww:'(
:'(:'(
:'(
ofna01 Mewtwo is telepathic not vocal which is two different things
Tear jerker #1 as a kid
Klumzeedragob its from Ponymon lol
Panda: Thing is, because he used all that effort to talk, he has trouble with regular pok?mon moves. Which is why he can never learn Payday
what a speechg :'(

Scoot-Scootaloo are you saying you got the poke-talk perk?
wb Dark92En|gma
how are things Dark92Enigma
Ok......POKEMON THE MOVIE!?
cubone the thug
00,03ya lol
which is better? pokemon tears or pheniox tears?
Cubone's antisocial
what happened did charizard kill cubones mum
this movie has a rather nice orchestral score Oo I'm suprised
cubone forevert alone
cubone.......UR MOM IS DED HAHAHAHAHA
Scoot-Scootaloo D: teach me Pokekiin!
alexxm: i'm fine, bro.......but i missed Rugrats
Scoot-Scootaloo, more like 50. He speaks in a character voice.
twilight_sprinkle: More like Cubone the smug. :P
?
RIP Cubone mom :'(
So... cubon is the strongest one there, considering it work only after cubone starts working.
the egg thing is soo cute:D
OK...........how did the Rugrats special finished? i missed it because of my BABY BROTHER
I'
dat lag
Eli Togepi
Eli Togepi?

rdibp dont worry. She is now a missingno in the world of pokemon
poor psyduck
AY JALE JALEO
twilight_sprinkle Japanese Canon I believe
Dark92En|gma: haven't played in a while :P

twilight_sprinkle: game canon
charizard farted
Panda: wow, thats some freaky canon
BUENAS NOCHES
Chat derped. :P
psyduck sticks the landing
dat gangnum stlye
twilight_sprinkle: I think so.
It's game canon that Cubone wears the skull of its mother
psyduck owns you
twilight_sprinkle it makes sense though. I mean he is called the *lonely pokemon* for a reason.
what did your brother do Dark92Enigma|gma
twilight_sprinkle yes its canon. And cubone's original name was going to be orfan
Gold_Demona: ikr?
Gold_Demona: das creepy
dem SEGWAYS

jigglypuff

Translation. She is going to murder you and your family
dat Onix
Oh, Vulpix. :P

alexxm because humans are lazy. which is why they fight using pokemon rather than their own fists.
pikachu vacations ?
Ash
alexxm this is a pokemon-themed special
:D
what have the humans done all this time? Having Coffee and tea?
Vacations all I ever wanted.
alexxm so humans are useless there

rdibp: the the that are tipped and no name thing

Ponyloverforever: you mean typing in italics, type /me

AjIsAwesome it started being shitty when sonic X released
the most powerful pokemon of all......in season 1
a movie?
I wish they hadn't cut out the whole first scene when they dubbed it.
/me thanks rdbip
WHERE.......AM I
Dark_Horst Pokemon the Movie
This is the pokemon movie?
The first one?
The whole part with MewTwo's cloning.
oooh, THAT one
The most powerful pokemon of all...you know, until the next gen.
twilight_sprinkle yup.
mew is my freaking screen background! i don't care much about pokemon anymore, but Mew is just way too cute :$
can you take a document for me and convert it into a PDF?
Barbetos|AtWork I believe so
my name is rdibp not rdbip
OK
so can you though
because libreoffice does not want to display it correctly
install doPDF and print it to that
Barbetos|AtWork: First one aired in Japan only. It was dark.
that's why you don't use that crap :P
AjIsAwesome what is it about?
yo Mewtwo! your mother is a hair!
/me is hungry
tell microsoft to make microsoft office compatible with linux then i'll use it XD
Technically, this movie is the second Pokemon movie. The first one only aired in Japan.
Oh yeah this is pretty dark too for pokemon
/me shares his dinner with PillowPoni|Phone :3
I remember this one I think. They gave away holgraphic mew two trading cards for the showings
I thought Pokemon was new back in 2000
PillowPoni|Phone: then go eat lol
why are you using Linux
AJIsAwesome yeah, you can get it ^^
because i feel more secure using it in public places
TRIVIA: There are several versions of the movie: 1 with Pikachu's vacation, the 2nd with the DNA trailer, and the 3rd with BOTH OF THEM
Panda: Cool.
i used to have that card :<
MLP_Brovakiin, thank you~
remember the holo cards too
twilight_sprinkle: same here
mew is adorable
there is a speculation that all the failed experiments are dittos
and cool
Lil_B: I saw that.
yo
/me had 6 ancient mews from this movie.
Ancient Mew card. I think I still have mine somewhere...
BladedWings: with what money? My fridge is empty it echoes
dittos are whores..... They can have babies with anyone
THIS CAN'T BE...........
i was going to install microsoft office on the other OS on this computer
Early Queen Chrysalis
/me hugs PillowPoni|Phone Its cool :3
In Japan, Mew isn't really any better than Mewtwo in his thinking
but i keep forgetting to do it XD
Panda: i also had 6. and lost/gave away all of themm :[
This is a very rushed..."Who am I? Where am I? what is my existence?" scenario.
...........MY DESTINY!!!!!!!!!!! :[
PillowPoni|Phone: oh..sorry :(
twilight_sprinkle I sold them a little while back for 50 bucks each XD
I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST
Here comes the dark part
LIKE NOONE EVER WAS!
Panda: woooooooooooow
MewTwo used RAMPAGE!!!
Meanwhile yes and if you think that's bland, wait for the end XD
cachi01|phone: save it for five minutes later, bro
well whatever, send me the file
And this is why I LOVE Mewtwo as a legendary.
Panda: so you made 250 dollars off promo cards?
is nobololo new?
YOU KNOW, FOR KIDS
for only just being created, he has astonishingly complex thought processes
Lol
Quick! Engage the flimsy robotic arms!
AND WE SUCCEDED
That will stop him!
twilight_sprinkle 300...
rdibp damnit, you ninjad me
ded
nobololol
Panda: wooooooooooooooooow
And MewTwo killed everybody
who does mewtwos voice?
I'm on mibbit
Dark92En|gma: Yep.
that won't work
use sendspace.com or something
he said he wasn't
EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN GOKU---i mean MEW
twilight_sprinkle I probbaly could have gotten more if I took it to a collector, considering they were in perfect condition.
Dark92En|gma: Tab fail
AJIsAwesome: DON'T worry
give me a second
I don't remember seeing him around here
Also, hello to whoever came in while I was doing laundry
trying to figure out how to close this window XD
rdibp I do mewtwos voice
pokemon?
Dan Green?
great :p
:O:O:O:O:O
Panda: really?
rdibp: Phillip Bartlett voiced MewTwo
o.O
Panda: those werent even collectors? holy hell...
When Dan Green was good.
oh well just throw it in the corner of the screen, i'll never notice it
i guess that thread was really effective, eh?
Yes, I am the voice of MewTwo... >.>
IT'S A TRAP
That was easy
Panda Yeah you totally are >_>
Panda *GASP*
can i email it to you?
did you get any replies?
robomew
twilight_sprinkle, hold on lemme check how much they go for xD
WHAT IS DIS
Now*
00,03I wonder if Veronica Taylor is a brony...
The plot in the dubbed English version contains a "fighting is wrong" moral and portrays Mewtwo as a cold, heartless villain who just wants to take over Earth. It also contains anti-racism material. Meowth, agreeing with his clone, says, "Maybe if we started looking at what's the same instead of always looking at what's different, well, who knows?" The Japanese version instead portrays Mewtwo as a confused b
I can't gelp but feel this entire situation shouldn't have been resolved over the course of five minutes...
Panda: last i checked, the non-promo ones are like 7 bucks
holy...
sonicandmario85: Pokemon, the 1st movie
that was more than I thought it was
whos Veronica Taylor?
00,03voice of Ash
inb4 Gary gets pwned
Meanwhile: help*
00,03she's like, the Tara Strong of the 90's!
I HAVE THE POWER
can you just use sendspace?
okay
PillowPoni|Phone: Oh, yes. Pardon me.
i was just asking if i could use that as a last resort
alakazam...:'(
all hired Pitches from the Baseball Ligue
not even pokeballs can defeat him
seems the german dub came from the english one then
Gary's fight
XD
twilight_sprinkle, yeah but you can get more from those crazy collectors. Much like how I sold the origional BEWD's to some yugioh collector for 80 bucks each xD
wait was double teaming even allowed back then
was that Gary?
Is that Gary Oak?
Yep
http://www.sendspace.com/file/ux4tq1
Gary Motherfuckin' Oak.
I remember the episode, too
Meanwhile, how're you doing? And I finally got /something/ done for my project
We see Gary's perspective of the fight
Meanwhile: IT IS HIM
i wish there was a way to delete this upload on the site now lol
was Mew ever in an episode of pokemon?
is gary in the pokemon game?
Panda: wow. i need to sell some of my older cards too if i can get that much. BEWD Is pretty cool though :P
I owned three album with cards
Dark_Horst yes, the german version has the "4 Kids" logo in it's opening
you know the gameboy game?
And then afterward he's booting out of the gym and he's all panicked and telling Ash that this pok?mon is evil
rdibp: i remember MewTwo was in an episode
DUNDUNDUNNNNN
ded
EPIC BGM
now mewtwo needs tot buy an organ
sonicandmario85: Unless you want to cross canons, no. Gary is not in the game. His game counterpart is Green/Blue
PillowPoni|Phone: Kinda gutted, tbh. I spent most of today on the back of a motorbike being ferried to places that treat me like an idiot.
they give you a delete link...
what was the point of the suit?
twilight_sprinkle. Ancient Mew: Errored (Range 150-600) Non Errored: 60-150
wtf
sonicandmario85 Just as Ash's game counterpart is Red
/me THE REIGN OF MEWTWO............SHALL SOON BEGIN.......!!!!!

MadSurge: LOL yup

Nyst: what about meowth?
That's what extended rohypnol does to a nurse.
*gasp* nurse joy!
Nurse Joy!
OH NO!

movie has been so loong ago th i dont even remmeber how german mewtwo sounded
Joy falls in love with Brock and they live happily ever after
HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY
3D FUCK YEAH
This is for everyone who did not notice this yet.
Snow: he is weird too, but him talking was explained in an episode.
M. Bison: OF COURSE
home edition i think
let'S blow some budget in a meaningless 180° shot
then you can't do an upgrade
What a comeback, Misty
Yeah well you're just a meanypants!
pointless scene in a pointless movie.
i wouldn't do an upgrade anyway
in mewtwo returns mewtwo is played by the voice actor of yami yugi
believe it or not
Meanwhile: Insert Ken reference
Oh wait. This movie was not pointless. It made Nintendo even more monies.
All for the sake of having Team Rocket in the movie. :P
Dark_Horst me nether, I have seren it 1ßß times, but that was long ago :(
but my vista installation has close to nothing important on it XD
aka Dan Green
Throw a pokeball at his ass while he ain't lookin'
Dark_Horst: its not like the rest of the animation is expensive
Oh my god...he gave them tattoos!
O///O
dat ass
Meanwhile: Ken: And you.....you're a LOSER -----Street fighter cartoon reference
the most valuable thing vista contains in fact is this installation of linux since it's installed through mint4windows lol
k
14o.o
thisguy :[
yeah, upgrade installs suck
AYYAYAYAY...QUE HICISTE JESSIE
I just noticed, that all the pokemon are nakid.
yeah
This is a movie for kids too.
they can make things buggy
wipe the hard drive with GParted and install Windows 7 xD
It's like they're wearing nothing at all...
i was curious though
Dark92En|gma: :|
Just for a fur........:'(
Clone james!
its like breeding, but easier...
if i can take the virutal disk for linux out of vista
its like applejack said "we dont normally wear clothes"
Who's that pok?mon?!
install 7, install mint4windows
It's Gloom!
um
why the frick
would you use a Windows based Linux install
Barbetos|AtWork: All the ponies are usually naked
then replace the virutal disk with the virtual disk with my previous linux installation if that would work
so that is how pokemon are born
just install it side by side
rdibp: what did i do wrong?
i was told it's best not to do that
/me died again.
And that's how Equestria was made.
we normally don't wear clothes
/me revives Snow
because if grub gets testy, everything is ruined
god fucking dammit, the movie doesnt force the plot at all
aww, i wouldve liked an exact clone of mew
We normally don't wear clones
Dark92En|gma: No! It can't be! Its IMPOSSIBLE!!
not at fucking all
thanks.
IMPOSSIBRU
and we succeeded......
um
Pokenstein.
i can't remember who said that
it's super easy to fix GRUB...
So that guy made a voice log right befor he died.
TAKE A GUESS
mew :3
Mew :3
but the better solution is just to run Linux in a VM
:3
HA! i was first
Star date AGGGHHHHAHHHAHAH!!
nice ankles gurl
lol
damn it
CHANGELINGS
yup, racism
AYYYYYYYYYYY SEXY LADY
dat tail.
But now I have my own purpose. And some righteous child bearing hips.
WOP WOPWOPWOP
poke a mon?
DATS RACIST!
i don't know drf
i am trying at all costs to preserve my current linux installation
ded
is it just me or does mewtwo look like giygas?
I always found it funny how MewTwo has a handle on the back of his head. :P
pikachu: WROOOOOOOOOOOOONG!
i see that tail and all i think is "wow, he could do his own tentacle porn"
why
WHY IS GARY DIFFERENT?
Gold_Demona: That's how you carry him around. :D
you have no idea how hard i had to work to get linux to work with the wireless card on this laptop
also HML is an idiot
don't listen to his computer advice
bear sound
Mewtwo the dumbest smart pokemon on the planet
Dark92Enigma cause tha's not gary
Maybe that's his weakness. XD
Dark92Enigma: aliens
the handle is because his brain is so extraordinary, one throat to support all the blood for his brain isnt enough
00,03Shoulda used a master ball...
grab the bull by the horns
I've dualbooted Windows and Linux plenty of times and all he's done is broken people's Windows installations
You should've had Rhydon.
Guess Mewtwo never learned the magic of friendship.
i don't even know how i fixed it
indeed
forget that, use a burlap sack
it started wanted to work with the wireless card after i removed the wireless card driver XD
rdibp: TheGreatAndPowerfulT CHANGELINGS, perhaps?
wanting
mewtwo for season 3 villan?
IS THAT A CHALLENGE?!
forget pokemon, use a shotgun
catch him old-school styole
style
TEAM DEATHMATCH
We need the elements of harmony!
ME OLIÓ A CONSOME DE POKEMON
Dark92Enigma they never say it's gary to begin with
which makes no sense to me whatsoever
slurrrrrrp

Scoot-Scootaloo >.> "Mew is now Fluttershy's hair."
IMA FIRING MAH LAZAR
00,03YES!
NOO NOT CHARIZARD YOU IDIOT
smelt the same studio made the game (APE inc. made Earthbound, got changed into Creatures INC. who made pokemon) but the guy who came up with all the designs was someone from a magazine whos owner came up with the idea of Pokemon, thus he has nothing to do with Earthbound
Charizard is such an angry bugger.
NO SELL
00,03BURN!
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BADGES TO TRAIN ME!!!!!!!
dat asshole Charizard
Lil_B: i see
My Charizard's WAY better
Dark92Enigma don't remember but it's probably just the dub changing things
me
why does he forget every time that charizard isnt listning to him?
Dark92Enigma: Ah, ok. :P
Meanwhile: Yep. :D
it's simple
just do lspci, find out what card it is, download the driver
you should ask me for help instead of HML LOL
And he repays him by acting like an asshole?
wait aren't we supposed to watch the mewtwo strikes back movie?
thanks Charizard. Should've let you die you ungrateful sod.
drf
Frou-frou?
that is what i did
aww gtg

RUN FAT PIKACHU RUN!!!
alexxm: Confusing dungeons.

Scoot-Scootaloo: my body is ready
Time for epic Pok?war
Lil_B you were going to say that

I really cannot wait for the horrible morale of the movie
alexxm yes I was just about to start typing XD
Ooh, CGI effects
moral*
i cannot wait for the horribly forced ending of this movie
I have altered the deal, pray I do not alter it further.
I like the moral, but the ending sucks.
BEHOLD
dinner back soon
I WONT LET YOU! *hat on backwards means it serious now*
"You few Humans will ba able to life on this small island while I bring hell to rest of earth"
Oh yeah

I KNOW THAT PSYDUCK IS GOING TO HAVE THE MOST EPIC FIGHT OUT OF ALL THE POKEMON, RIGHT?

RIGHT?!
MEW!!! :3

Ash has yet to learn a powerful Pimü's Backhand-Handslap
Scoot-Scootaloo, Snow, Mew is now Fluttershy's hair http://imgur.com/UDzMJ
Adorable :3
Mew: Oh you fucker, it begins.
Gen 1 Shadow Ball?
Mewtwo used shadowball
did shadow ball exist in gen 1?
Panda: amazing!
mew has a.d.d.
mew dont give a shit
Panda genious :D
00,03Panda: Oh lawdy, i have to see this colored :D
No, Shadowball did not exist in Gen 1
Mew is totally fucking ignoring him#
/me died even more because mew.
what is this a dr seuss book?
MARIO MARIO AND LUIGI MARIO
It came about in Gen 2
Scoot-Scootaloo when I return from the store ill do that :)
gotcha
thank you Snow, Lil_B ^^
KAKARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOT
00,03looking forward to it!
Mew literally does not care.
so what movei is that?
Dark92Enigma: I hatd that bit in the movie. :|
ded
Panda I will love you for ten whole seconds if you colour that!
Mewtroll
MEW STRIKES BACK! *movie name pun for the obviously challenged*
Mew gives around as many fucks as I do.
Mew's like "Oh no you DIDn't!"
mew got hit by mewtwo?
DashWithRainbows D: only ten? But I wun you forever ;A;
wub*
IM RAGING OVER HERE!
How did Mewtwo NOT see that? :S
Sorry, Gary's girth has me forever/
AJIsAwesome: ME too........but the ''Mew and Mewtwo'' title drop reminded me of it
D:
Alright, brb
Mew's speech to Mewtwo is different in the Japanese version. In the English version, Mew gives a speech about how real strength comes from the heart, whereas in the Japanese version, Mew declares that all unnatural life (ie, clones) are inferior to the originals, and thus should perish.
yes,you were also created with a sexy voice
Pffft, I bet Mewtwo is shit compared to modern legendaries
Mewmewmewmewmewmewmew.
00,03is gary even in this movie?
Convenient traduction
Scoot-Scootaloo, he's too awesome for this movie
Scoot-Scootaloo nope
help! im dieng of the cuteness again!
Scoot-Scootaloo:
Scoot-Scootaloo: Nope, he's too busy being Gary
:3
OUR FINALE BATTLE BEGINS
yes
Scoot-Scootaloo: In the beginning, I think.
If he was Scoot-Scootaloo, he would just have to show up and MewTwo would be his slave.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Gary got pwned by MewTwo in Giovanni's gym
Scoot-Scootaloo: He was briefly seen in the Mewtwo training montage, getting his ass beat.
Scoot-Scootaloo: dub fail....i'll tell you later
CHAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE
AJIsAwesome: you are correct
00,03oh yeah
mewtwo
dat guitar
I KNOW THAT PSYDUCK IS GOING TO HAVE THE MOST EPIC FIGHT OUT OF ALL THE POKEMON, RIGHT?
he makes a cameo
00,03And now, cool scene!
LEEEEEEEEROOOOY JEEEEEEENKIIIIIIINS!
being able to stop all of their powers
i should leave, bye
brother my brother :'(
I don't remember this convinience lock of SPecial abilitys from the movie :/
will it be a cliffhanger ending?
LAST ONE ALIVE LOCKS THE DOOR
such a sad song
what's with this music suddenly?
bbbff
And so, Ash learns a valauble lesson.............Fighting must be...............wrong :'(
DAT SONG DISSONANCE
rdibp: iseewhatyoudidthere.
This music does not fit very well.
00,03OH you know what I should do?
If they cloned me, the clone would have so much HP and firepower it would be unbeleiveable.
this
is
epic
Thank god I wasn't there, eh :)
"fighting is bad" SAID THE MOVIE TO THE SERIES WHICHS ENTIRE PURPOSE IS FUCKING FIGHTING
GO PONYTA
best part
its tf2 all over again
duck
pikachus is better
Psyduck best scene evar
It's mr. Fish!
Well, it depends on your definition of fighting and to the extent of your fighting.
When will we learn? :'(
NInetails <3
Dark_Horst "You are not supposed to Fight LIKE THIS" You are meant to fight like gentlemens
I thought the moral was that "you can't judge a person by where they came from".
Dark92Enigma: On thursday
best battle ever
O_O
what...
:D
wut?
:D
BBBFF
LMAO wut?!
:D yes
wat

Hahahaha

Sudden BBBFF
this part in the japanese music had lavender town style music,but more depressing
LAWL
Inb4 silly slapfight
way to kill the ambient
perfectly fiting XD
MY BBBFF
...
As if the original music wasn't unfitting enough.
fits so well.
Why are they fighting again?
The atmosphere has been crushed...
^
WE'RE MISSING THE LESSON :[
MadSurge: Because I stole their Oreos
YOUR BBBFF
FITS SO DAMM WELL
why?
Serenity: YOU MONSTER :[
Well Atmosphere is crushed
So what are they talking about?
the lesson was something about bacon
^
(never saw this movie)
Also playing music over the talking. :(
:'(
00,03rewind?

Super smash pokemon melee.

LAST ONE ALIVE LOCKS THE DOOR
Wait this song is actually part of the movie?
Watching Pokemon?
Meanwhile: Yes. :D
Meanwhile: Yes.
Meanwhile yep
i copypasted it from the movies bulbapedia page, so it should be correct
Meanwhile yes :3
hey Guys
I thought it was more silly background stuff.
PONY UP BOYS!
Meanwhile: eeyup
While looking over all these Furbies beating the shit out of each other, Ash finally comes to a stunning realization..........fighting must be........bad :'(
Goddamn I want to pop whoever decided on putting this in in the mouth.
PAWNCH
KICK
Snow: i swear they on porpusly left that line in so that we can mess around with it
I have to chose now, watching Pokemon with you guys, or watching Pretty Cure. Which should I do?
SHOW ME YOUR MOVES!
Meanwhile: I can give you a gun that shoots cinderblocks.
PSYDUCK
PAWNCH
dat slap
GUYS! ITS NOT F-ZERO!
Duck! 6_9
i miss my childhood..........
:'(
I havent acctually watched the japanese version of this movie (only part of it) so I dont know what mew acctually says
When will we learn?......:'(
My childhood has been ruined by CoDfags
Who here watched Pretty Cure?
Snow, fun fact, F-Zero series has no punching move
ded
it does
00,03dat hicky
thats the meme from
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
I still have my special mew Card from when this released in Cinemas ... my one and oldy Pokemon Card
Lovebite.
dat buffer
Snow, the meme is from SSB
00,03BUFFERjkjhkj
Dat orchestra ;(
lul
Oh my, even Pikachu is getting horribly beaten.
CrimsonPhoenix: Actually, the anime has Falcon punching someone
not F-Zero
AND IT'S A HOME RUN!!!!!!
them's getting snuggly
Serenity, The anime has close to no continuity
and that was basically a fan-service
Serenity: Yeah, since Captain Falcon dies in the anime.
Yes, violence is never the answer in any situa----Oh, you're still going. Sorry.
mmewtwo needs to work on his bioengineering
-because making them fight everywhere else is fine?
Movie About Fighting Monster - Fighting is Wrong
YOU FUCKERS ARE HYPOCRITS!
Meanwhile: Film logic, ey?
GOD, this shit is giving me a headache
AND THEN POKEMON WAS CANCELLED
fighting is wrong? welp cancel the franchise!
You done? Okay, so after we discover that-
Rocketshipper here.
the trouble has been doubled
they sooo kept that promise
Let's instead trap them in dark cold balls and only let them out to fight eachother brutal fights for our entertainment.
I'll get the Funnel for more emotional explaining how fighting like this iswrong
But... Fighting is Magic
AND THEN MEOWTH BECAME A THIRD WHEEL
Und now, spelling the moral out.
copycat...
so team rocket's meowth is the only one that talks?
HNNNG
PUNS
O.0
Heya everypony! ^^
iseewhatyoudidthere
yes rdash
clawful mistake :D
Hi, TheMonstaMuffin :)
yes rdibp
hia TheMonstaMuffin
Okay seriously, ya done? Are ya sure? There's no other obvious life lessons you wanna cram into our heads? Okay, so after that we find out that there's-
rdibp: He learned the English language in a school
Heya TheMonstaMuffin
eath?
biggest life lesson
the same everything
rdibp: He's not the ONLY pokemon that talks, but he's one of the rare few.
in my life
He eavesdropped the class, and learned to talk.
-And remember to brush your teeth.
how the *** did meowth said earth?
Hi AJIsAwesome, Lil_B and MLP_Brovakiin
inb4 :'(
Hey is saw this movie with my best friend 4 years ago :D
Snow: Pok?mon takes place on Earth. Didn't you know? That's how they know about Vikings in Minnesota. :D
PIKACHU USED SLAP
Nutted.
Seeing Ash climb like this, I have a theory. EZIO IS ASH'S FATHER!!!
hi TheMonstaMuffin :)
No Pikachu, no! Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself! Oh God, self-abuse! So what are we supposed to learn from this onslaught of violence? :'(
y u slapping urself??
Heya thelonepony
Slap a hoe.
no... i ment the accent meowth said earth
i have class
...dafuq is this now
sounded wery familiar
sounded like oif. not earth
inb4 :'(
Snow: Oh, you meant "oyth"? :P
oh
GET OVER IT
grab a shotgun
grab. a shotgun
eeeeeeyup
SHUT UP! Goddammit shut up! We get it, violence is bad, don't fight, we will not fight, how many times do you have to hammer this shit in? I mean, talking about it doesn't make us LESS violent, it makes us more violent!
fighting is bad....fighting is so bad man, i mean its so bad, that its really bad
*thinks about fighting is magic*
But is it bad bad BAD bad?
yup, fighting is bad.
dat pokemon
Say no to drugs.
Ash is Poke-Jesus
Am I the only one who finds it a little ironic that a franchise that's made it's whole profit on nothing BUT fighting, is suddenly telling us that it's BAD to be fighting?
Dark92Enigma, no you're not
NOW COUNTERATTACK WHILE HES TIRED
KABOOOOOM!
If someone touches you and it makes you feel bad, thats no good.
now for the best part
Now snap his neck like a fortune cookie.
waow
Dark92Enigma: dat nc quote
How fucking hypocritical is that? That's like O.J. Simpson going around telling everyone that it's bad to kill people.
dbz refference there
rdibp: he has a point
It's film logic
RIGHT THERE.
Get dafuq over it
Dark92Enigma: I always took it as Pok?mon battles being more like playful competition, which is why the pok?mon don't die. But THISA fight is one where they're literally trying to kill each other.
dat aura.
Snow IT'S OVER 9000?
Snow: DBZ came AGES after this did
the lesson is not to just fight
once again, inb4 :'(
Gold_Demona: Agreed.
And Ash ded
but to not figjt for no good reason
ded
DED
Ded
but to fight for what is right
ded
Well that was fucking stupid.
and thats how equestria was made
GAME OVER YEEEEAAAAAH!
cowvarkian: :D
HE'S DED GOKU! JE'S DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
and of course he is still not meat confetti
and now
for the most
:'(
FAIL..........you idiot.....:'(
he died for your Sins!
Ponymon-Anarchy: Like Money?
makes sense?
And then he died. The end.
non-sensical scene
And Ash turned to stone... For some reason
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE!
ash forgot how to DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGEEE
ever made into history
why is he stone
Your dodge failed
cause why the buck not
Snow
pikachu. bio defibrilator
Snow i forgot that one
an alternative line to what misty said: my bike......*atmosphere ruined*
CLEAR
DEAD
Live you stone bastard!
......that pikachu....
IT'S A ROCK, YOU DUMB YELLOW RAT
When Pikachu is repeatedly shocking Ash to try to bring him back to life, Misty says "Pikachu..." in the Japanese version, and "Please, no..." in the English version. A commentary revealed that the dubbers had many alternatives for this piece of dialog, one of them being, "My bike..." LOL
:'(
LOL smelt
Ponymon-Anarchy: Fight for the right thing. In Pokemon games it's money. Or you won't be able to buy Pokeballs.
I really want to see a pikajew
A ROCK.........
THAT'S MY DESTINY
xD
i was talking about the cartoon
LETS HELP ASH EVERYPONY :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
HERE WE GO
SPARKLES
OH MY GOD A GIANT ROCK
:'(:'(:'(
Fuck off charizard you never liked him anyway.
and you also ended up defeating team rocket
That's a lot of sparkles
:'(
this scene make sme angry
And no feels were given that day.
sparkle sparkle sparkle
WE CARE...........:'(
14o.o
So many sparkles, cannot run them
dat donkey
The power of, umm... Sadness?
LMAO Dark92Enigma
:'(:'(
:'(
And then ash lived
:'(
LET THE LEMON JUICE BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE!
BLAM SHAM WOW
'dat stone, powered by hate
why is this happening
I really love the NC review of this
DISTURB NOT THE POWER OF FIRE ICE AND LIGHTNING ETC:THUS THE WORLD WILL TURN TO ASH! oh wait wrong movie......
that made me cry when i was 7 :'(
:'(:'(
so much
Adn should've been named Gary instead. Cuz HE"S SUCH A GARY STU!!!
Ash is Undead now, doomed to stay Ten forever.
:'(
That's impossible! Also disgusting.
last one for good measure, :'(
this shouldnt be able to work becasue of so many fucking reasons that i cant decide where to start with naming them all
This made me cry so often as a kid... every damn time :(
Why tears are like the A-BOMB in here?
2000 made me cry more
I feel nothing for this.
The first film that ever made me cry was E.T
He would make an excellent statue for my garden.
Fun fact, because of the way the tear ducts are connected to the sinuses, a lot of that is probably Pokemon snot.
sorry to say it
Nyst: quoting R&L nice
The Celebi movie made me cry more than that
i guess crying does solve your problems after all
true dat.
4 ever
Lil_B: i get you. thouhg i only saw it once
Gold_Demona: Which one?
i have that on dvd
cowvarkian, Gold_Demona: in Pokemon Best wishes, the narrator says Ash is STILL 10!!
If that's what tears can do.......i wonder what SNOTS can do!
you know,if you look past childhood memories, this is one dumbass scene
YES!! mlp got the tubey award
*thinks about it*
aw, look at them ninetails
rdibp: that Spongebob reference
Eli: I have no idea what R&L is. But thanks anyway.
damn I love Ninetails
i actually have EVERY pokemon film ._.
AJIsAwesome: I guess it's 4Ever?
oh really :D
I gotta get some food in my stomach. Cya laterz guys :)
Snow even the G4 ones?
AJIsAwesome: The one that also has Suicune
and G5?
I see now...that this movie is terribly paced.
:')
and then everyone died
i have one till the new one
So, are people even dying in that world? I mean, they mustve discovered that tears bring back the dead to life so they mustve had harvested the tears as some sort of miracle medicine
00,03so... pokemon 2000 next time?
WEEEEEEEEEEEEE
victini
Scoot-Scootaloo: YES!!!!!!!
oh, pokemon 2000 was good
I guess the lesson is that pokemon tears cure petrify.
better than this imo
Hey every- are we streaming pokemon?
Pok?mon Movies! Yay!~ 8D
Scoot-Scootaloo Strange enough I watched that yesterday.
Scoot-Scootaloo when is "Nest Time"?
Hi, Obsidian! :)
apparently Obsidian
and now,the clones all float toward their creator....and thus tthe world was saved.....then everypony here forgot what happened
Mew-Two = Awesome Voice and Life Lessons. Mew = Kitty Cat?
<.<
Scoot-Scootaloo otherwise... YES!
Meanwhile: i say the japanese version is more concise, i guess
00,03idunno lol, maybe friday morning!
and then mewtwo was peter pan
and THEN THEY FORGET EVERYTHING
and then he wiped there memories<.< LAAAAAME
hai Obsidian, can i mine you? :3
AFTER ALL OF THAT LESSON!?!
*their
adn then you could find mewtwo in a cave
ummmm.. no
and then it was dream
Und dann it was all a dreeeeaaaam.
Stupid buggers.
Dark92Enigma: why of course, they have to keep fighting SOMEWHOW
And MewTwo moved to Cerulean Cave
AND NOT A SINGLE LESSON WAS LEARNED THAT DAY!!! :[
in the commentary they said they wanted that forget thing to happen in the cinema,so that people would buy it again and again
what did he do
and so they learned absolutly nothing

Meanwhile: I accept that truth
And then they forgot their lesson. :|
Meanwhile: :D

Remember kids, the moral of the story is: Play all of our games, collect all of our trading cards, and all of the pokemon!
hoho
It was mew, you derps :P
Maybe you're an idiot, Misty. :P
hey, high-light this rainbow dash face :D
smelt: Somehow, years before the game was made.
Suddenly a narator...

00,03hey, remember when charizard and pikachu left?

Lil_B: .... i dont think thats how it goes
Scoot-Scootaloo: They did?
they did.
Pikachu never left. He only ALMOST left
Way to piur salt in the wound, Misty. :|
charizard kinda left twice, didnt he
*pour
:>
Scoot-Scootaloo: i do
Dark_Horst I know, but that's how I understood it for 4 years i watched it :/
DAMMIT, NOW YOU GOT ME ALL SAGGY!
:'>
Lil_B: wow
"old friend" Butterfree lasted for less than 20 episodes in the show
SAPPY*
Charizard left but he is also kind of on standby
00,03whoops..
Snow: lol saggy
/me puts Snow in a toaster
play the video when brock and misty left
What about his Pidgeotto? We skipped him.
charizard. with a pink bow
Dragon Pussy.

Girl Charizard
charizard leaves ash>ash abandons charizard
dem expressions
notice how there is only ONE female?
DAT FACE
>_>
-You know, since you're kind of a twat anyway.
Gold_Demona: I think it was a Pigeot when it left
this isn't the most emotional Charizard moment
:O
00,03BURNNN
this was even more heartbreaking, but not as Pikachu's moment
goddamn
That scene when Charizard is weak and Ash has to take care of him is better
CrimsonPhoenix: Mine was when Charizard was frozen.
I love how Charizard is still considered Ash's strongest Pokemon.
Obsidian: Oh yeah, that's right. He let it go IMMEDIATELY after it evolved!
Yeah AJIsAwesome that one
is ash's hat always over his eyes when a pokemon leaves?
and now>ASH RUNS LIKE A GIRRRRL
so....
CrimsonPhoenix: you thinking of that one time when it got frozen?
Dark_Horst, yeah
charizard left ash ;A;
dat tumb.
Ash, why are you such a weenie!? D:<
puke
Panda: no, ash left charizard
That moment when they earned eachothers thrust
twilight_sprinkle: Pikachu is Level Plot. He's as strong as the plot needs him to be.
AND I RAN
trust**
Scoot-Scootaloo: Can you play the scene where Charizard is frozen?
lol that one
00,03frozen?
And the part where Pikachu almost leaves
RUN FOREST RUN!
Fat charizard.

Chaaaaaaaaaaa
Scoot-Scootaloo: how long is this video?
Scoot-Scootaloo: it was during the Orange Island Arc
Scoot-Scootaloo: Poliwrath used Ice Beam on him and Ash had to take care of him, or else he would die.
PI KA CHUU
Stan soon arose from the circle of electricity and consumed them all.
Satan*
dat brock voice
Where are you going Ass?
Buytoast: or just stan
oh...my god....
I loved the Orange Island Arc of Pokemon.
Ash really had a "leave my pokémon, they'll do much better without me" syndrome during first gen
Scoot-Scootaloo: he got frozen in a fight, i think, and they had to that him up and prevent him from dying of hypothermia
my tears, THEY RETURNED!
:'(
00,03Hell, someone pm me a link, pls
Scoot-Scootaloo of what?
And for the record.......i still love the good-old Pokemon no matter what the Nostalgia Critic says, yet still that's his opinion, and i respect him for that
ash:releases all his good pokemon because 'its the right thing to do'
Scoot-Scootaloo: sorry, no idea when that was

reminds me to fav this on Youtube... this song is awesome
Lil_B While don't understand a majority of the song, i still get the ''midnight'' part
i don't*
This is somewhat epic.
Can't make out the what's the song about unless you give me the lyrics for example'
!!!!
killerpony7733 He's basicly singing about Midnight, how people are afraid of it, how Midnight is gonna get you, that there is no escape etc
DBZ ABRIDGED. YES
Yay
TFS, yes!
:)
Lyra! :D
Ghost_Nappa: hey vegeata
killerpony7733: most of the song IS in Latin anyway.
Lil_B Makes sense with the tone he sings in.
are we there yet?
lol
NO
are we there yet?
NO
Dark_Horst: It still has some meaning.
killerpony7733 you could say it's a standard dark groomy song about something humanity was always a bit afraid of, but I really like this song anyway
lol
14o.o
Lil_B Despite never knowing what it was about it's pretty damn awesome
And there goes Lyra
No, there she is again
Hey Lyra

Seapony Lyra has nothing but scorn for your desire to watch DBZ Abridged.
Lyra demands my attention!

killerpony7733 yes :) but iT't really is often not neccesary to understand a song to like it, like with all the latin chorus songs I hear
Welp..that lasted forever.

So how many special task forces does Frieza have anyway?
Reikim, the cloth was soaked in blood
Reikim: Its soaked in his friends blood
Plus DBZA is a parody, not an actual show.
i will still vist bronystate though and watch mlp fim
DBZ has as much entertainment as a lobster.
freiza runs a massive empire, so probably a lot

why is dr whooves slumbering
thx :p
I think the channels finally setup the way it shouldive been before
2,14 why does everyone think he's doctor whooves
thats caramel
Pretty sure that's Caramel.
2,14 that's getting really frustrating -_-
Don't have to worry about those spammers anymore
wb
cuz he is dr whooves
Probably because Caramel is so background most people don't know who he is.
2,14 sigh
It's his name!
dr whooves has brown fur
what spammers?
They're confusing them because they are ignorant and clearly cannot see that he lacks a time turner symbol.
gasp new pony
dr whooves
2,14 THAT is dr whooves
Really, Caramel looks NOTHING like Tennant. I don't see why you'd confuse the two.
Oh sorry, I can't remember who was with me when we had a bunch of bots coming in here to spam another irc server :/
Now he brings up the camparison

Do you guys mean Time Turner?
2,14 rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
its another pony
hiya Caramel
CrimsonPhoenix: no that's Doctor Hooves
no
ask caremel
CrimsonPhoenix: his OFFICIAL Hasbro name is Doctor Hooves
Time Turner
NO
HOOVES GODDAMMIT
That's not what it says on the card
no not whooves
...
little fanboy mind
THAT CARD IS OLD
goddammit where is that article?
is it about welovefine?
welovefine is as canon as the cards
hm... warcraft 3?
dr whooves has a diff skin and hair color butt they doo look similar
He IS the Warchief.
i guess
Time Turner is a background Earth pony with an hourglass cutie mark. The character's fan-given name, Doctor Whooves, was for a time adopted by the show's crew,[1] and only later was the character explicitly given the name "Time Turner" in a 2012 set of trading cards. Between the cards' BronyCon pre-release and hobby store release, Hasbro notified one of their licensors, Mighty Fine, that the character is named Dr. Hooves.​
that tutorial
and who was IStilllikeSpyro?
Lyra said, "Fuck yo nightmares!"
you want a link too?
idk
hmm...
no theyre different people
i think

ok im wrong again
otakon, as you copy pasted
i havent seen istilllikespyro here though
CrimsonPhoenix: yes?
Mighty fine is as canon as the cards
Its possible he/she could be under a different name
Hogger, Hogger everywhere.
yeah maybe
Well regardless...hopefully we will see him/her soon
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah and if you freaking READ it it say Hasbro changed his name to friggin' Dr. Hooves
Tutorial voice is satisfying.
the only TRUE way to officially say its name to be true
MURLOCKS!
is in blindbags
MRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr
Murlocs!
yup for sure
I hate murlocs.

lucky
5000 users tonight liarjack
I hate Tuesdays.
I don't mind Mondays.
So I just had a thought
You're making a game blako?
And see if you follow me on this one
i found out the same voice for Prince Blueblood is Iron Will :O
btw hai :3
I hate most of the days except Friday.....Friday is my best day ever
thank Celestia for rashashana
Alright, ready.
Haiya rdibp :)
hi
Okay, first point: EA announces that they are proud of the fact that they have not greenlit any games that are exclusively single player, citing that they want to implement multi-player functionality in every franchise they own in some format, be it Facebook apps or full MMO status.
yeah, I am making one application and one game, the game is called Sparx the dragonfly
Second point: They just officially confirmed that Dragon Age 3 is being developed.
13so EA is in full on death spiral mode
Let those two sink in for a moment.
13yay
Wow........
You KNOW what that has to mean.
Hmm.....
DA3 has multi-player of some sort.
13bioware has been brainwashed?
EA has done away with all pretense and just announced their plans of chaos?
it is still in the beginning, but I have everything prepared... I just need some 3D models to make it look like a game :D
Dragon age is good game
Awesome :p
Sumica: Better take out the trash. At night.
Now what KIND of multiplayer, that's unclear. But if their prior statement is to be believed....then DA3 has to have it.
00,10for a company that is dieing they sure seem to be making alot of games still Shizuka
CK|Catnap: Hmm, seems interesting.
then I can make 3D collisions and then it will be easy
CK|Catnap: da3 release?
Shizuka: Bioware was indoctrinated by the rEApers
Shizuka: they got absorbed by EA
Whether it's just stupid Facebook apps or full blown multiplayer, or god forbid, they pulled a C&C and ripped out its soul to incorporate it into the MMO fleet they're building
otakon: ninjaed
13ea desperately wants a slice of the world of warcraft pie
CK|Catnap: there is going to be MP in DA3.
Yeah, mull that one around in your head for a moment, Dragon Age Online
Shizuka: not really that
13let their hubris kill them
Shizuka: they want everyones pie
CK|Catnap: argh
bronysith I see wat u did thar
just wait for it, they're gonna pull their f2p, p2w bullshit on DA3 too
Goodnight people
/me wonders how TES: Online will turn out
They want to goddamn "broaden the demographic" for EVER GODDAMN GAME THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH
King Terenas Menethil.
you can't DO THAT
Sure you can!
I also thought about multiplayer, but it would be quite difficult, because I would have to learn some stuff about udp, and how to manage it
it makes it too goddamn thin
yeah
Just make Dead Space 3 not scary, Dragon Age 3 into a button masher, and C&C into an MMO
00,10shenaganins, humans cant be druids
More Money!
And then, for the next game, we can make them all the same game!
Sumica: cata
CK|Catnap: and then the game is no longer what it was supposed to be.
Dragon Space 4: Command and Conquer Edition.
Is there anything I can help you with that requires no skill? :p
CK|Catnap: stop that!
00,10the king is still alive, this is not cata
otakon: he has a point
At least we'll still have Obsidian and XCOM: UFO Defense
13on a more positive note
beta testing? heh
Dark_Horst: true
Just Command edition. Conquer is the DLC.
13torchlight 2 in three days
Shizuka: ture
Nope. It's my job to terrify you. :D
XCOM!
WHO IS GETTING IT?
Cuz idk how to animate, model, texture or anything like that :p
Torchlight. Eh, was ok.
13on a more positive more positive note, black mesa
Meeeeeh.
Am looking forward to TL2, since I've heard that it's better than D3 and cheaper to boot.
00,10oh is gaben freman gonna lose some weight and learn how to jumpgood?
When did remakes become a good thing.
But still gonna wait for official reviews anyways.
I'm looking forward to XCOM, but not enough to preorder it. I really wish there was a demo or something I could try.
Hey Everypony! :)
CHANGELING!
Derp_Derp: Hallow! O3O
00,10heh, I peed on that guys grave
hi DerDash
Hi, DerpDash :)
Shizuka: lol
DerpDash: Hallow! O3O
hiya Arthas
how are things DerpDash
Meanwhile: I'd say roughly about the time that Nintendo re-released OoT for the tenth time. And then all the XBox fans said "lol Nintendo sux" and rushed out to go buy Halo 1, now with HD paint.
hahahahahahahahah oh sumica your funny dude
13http://fav.me/d5f3usi
before you went all evil like
:D don't know, maybe some Ideas later, or testing compatibility on Mac and windows, bc I use Linux (don't worry, I use multiplatform libraries)
hey everypony :)
alexxm: Great! Got back from school
CK|Catnap: yeah but Halo hadn't been remade 20 times before really
Seriously
otakon: Give it time
EVER GODDAMN ZELDA IS THE SAME
sure
I mean I LOVE the Zelda series don't get me wrong
Yeah I'd happily argue against that.
CK|Catnap: Good point.
otakon: and super mario game, yes :D
yeah
The ones that are samey are generally the handhelds, which (unsurprisingly) I don't like much.
Elemental based dungeons? check
And to be fair, it's a remake made by modders as opposed to the actual company (afaik)
tool that you get in every dungeon that lets you continue on
But the console ones have generally been decently differentiated, at least to some degree.
But actually, that's also kind of worse.
also a 3/7 Dungeon system
It sends out the impression that the fans just want the same thing over and over instead of something new.
otakon: That's like saying every FPS is the same because they all feature guns and you're expected to hide behind walls and shoot at people before they shoot you first.
3 beginner dungeons, you hit the mid boss then 7 dungeons then final boss
....oh wait.
I c wut u did thar.
I know me too :p
/me sighs
you do? Good.
But no srsly.
Its not too far away
I haven't played Spyro in a whole week cuz I've been so busy with school :O
Now that doesn't mean that the games are lousy by any means
Its been way longer for me
damn arthas, you evil
:(
The differentiation between a given pair of Zeldas is probably larger than any other sequel out there. Except for direct sequels like the New Mario Bros Wii U shit, because that's pretty much blatant C/P.
So, a Paladin and a couple of Warriors?
timmeh!
Lots of family stuff going on :/
CK|Catnap: OoT and MM
are their elemental dungeons?
yes
Quests.
Lets make an MMO with NO QUESTS
oh nvm
That sucks :/
And you just have to figure it out.
I played it about 2 months ago when there was the competetion "collect as less gems as possible", but the competition somehow... ended
Oh wait. Thats called Darkfall.
00,10oh god that face
what game is this anyway?
Barbetos|AtWork: there is a Zombie MMO coming out like that
00,10kilitkillitkillit
(on spyroforum)
Sumica Dat voice
otakon: Mechanically, the two are actually significantly different, despite being built on the same engine. OoT and MM are the example of how to do sequels RIGHT, not a bad thing. >_>
Dovah: it's Warcraft 2
ahem 3
otakon it is out. It is called Day Z =P
Dovah: warcraft 3
00,10Dovah, it's warcraft 3
Barbetos|AtWork: no there is another one
i see
i lost the game :/
it's called War Z
or *ahem* The War Z
Dovah: the last real Warcraft
based off of the novel I think
:(
it is better to keep it backuped on pc
which one?
The way to do sequels WRONG is to release the same game with one extra element added, and then to have sports people show up on stage and claim in terribly scripted lines how it's "just like playing the sport for reals dawg"
I wish I could've did that though
ooh, warcraft 3, long time no see
i thought it was world war z otakon
looked like a dayz/l4d crossover to me
It's called the game
CK|Catnap: you mean like Dragon Age 2?
I'
00,10heh, suddnly thinking of "wrath of the couch potato"
I can't even force myself to play through it
00,10they sum up all of warcraft 3 in 30 seconds
Also GODDAMMIT THE FUCKED UP THE ONLY FUCKING DWARF IN THE GODDAMN GAME
Fuck yo farm!
Varric is dwarf
Dwarves are partially resistant to magic
I have to go now, need some sleep for tomorow school :D
so bye
Varric has no magic resistance what so ever
cyas
cya
Bullshit Bioware
Simple goddamn bullshit
13we can't give the sword of a thousand truths to a NOOB
/me doesnt know what game this is
we can't quote South Park when it's not on the STREAM.
Shizuka: lol but it's the only thing that can kill that which has no life!
/me or who's playing it
#pirates-of-equestria i need some rpers!
hey look warcraft 3
Meanwhile: yes we can ...BEEFCAKE!
slavianka: no advertising
that tent is way past redemption
No advertising other channels in here slavianka.
FAAACK!
Bonk.
did he get kicked?
or did he just leave?
I don't think he knew
i think its a she
00,10kicked
ah
But yeah, thought I would share. Now we wait to hear how DA3 has implemented multiplayer.
advertising and then screaming obsceneties in capslock does not make you look good
00,10oh right embeded chat dont have conectings and parts any more
Sumica: indeed not
Dark_Horst: true but I don't think they realized the no advertising rule of THIS particular channel or forget.
00,10I think that was done for every ones sanity during new eps
CK|Catnap: probably f2p open world with pay to win mode
And I would join them but I'm too busy digging a grave for C&C
So I can cry at it.
Hey sumica can i ask you a only question and be honest ok
TIMMY! WE HERE TO SAVE YOU!! WHERE ARE YOU??
CK|Catnap: from the looks of things it's probably gonna be like ME3's model
00,10glad to see arthus geting an early start on his 100kills
13LIE
13LIE YOUR PLOT OFF
sheep
NOT THE SHEEP!

It's been ages since he's played any of it though.
Caramel: why i can see why, i'm gonna proceed to jackhammer it out of my head anyway
Shizuka: Demon ponies are watching you do stuff
Caramel: but this is a catchy song! :D
