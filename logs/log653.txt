00,10how is he useing a touch pad with gloves?
:D
13ikr
13i barely made it my first try, then realize there was a whole section of the lab i hadn't got to explore, plus that achievement for the experiments
13still haven't got that fifth experiment though..
Hey Everypony! :)
Bye Bye everypony.
00,10ah ok
13not yet
13got the other four experiments though
00,10the one that used to have a bottmless pit
dam felecia day can do everything
13you just have to try to dodge them
They're easier to dodge in BM:S than in HL1.
They hurt me even if they come anywhere near me.
00,10they have to be seeing as gorden is now 6 feet wide and weighs 450lbs
00,10hahah
13sellout...
00,10heheh
13and the post resonance cascade level... gave me chills
00,10then throw trashcans at every one
13jaja and then he's suddenly "busy" with a flat panel on the supercomputer
00,10they have a few of them
13indecipherable muttering... incomprehensible blabbering...
00,10but then again I was also busy playing stack the trashcans on the guys head
13it starts out repeating the same sub that you can't hear them but then it starts getting silly
00,10I took a screen shot of it
00,10I had like 6 cans on the guys head
lol...
00,10then I procided to try and throw trash in to them
Are there stream?
13i heard a few sound effects from riven scattered around
13like the er'cana platform in uru being used as the drawbridges in l4d2
00,02this is that thing
00,02neat ^_^
13that and the endless endless antlion tunnels
00,02AdamTheDuck, wat
o.o
goddamn antlions
00,10first off cause *spoiler*
I see. This song is from HERE, and THAT is the meaning of the lyrics "show that horse"
13eli getting the bridge dropped on him.. and sure it makes sense for that point in the plotline, but still
13for it to just end there with no resolution in the forseeable future
00,02AdamTheDuck, i'm not sure anyone can
I just... I don't even.
"It's a good day to be homeless" *shudders*
For science!`
00,10the one free man

13black mesa needs a breen cameo
00,10"I hate the homeless. *changes card* problem in this city"
The vorts where freed by him
A reworked Xen
13vorts might have done it
Barny for example knows most of it
00,10to me it's like normal
13it makes sense sure but you never see it play out in-game
00,02Dumorimasoddaa, barny told everyone, problem solved
13the next minute it's 1984 and combine are everywhere
00,02g-man did it
00,02read: magic
00,02probably should
But bridging gaps is fine for ordinary jumping
00,10yeah
13especially the aliens one
13simba the strider
00,10yeah
13especially especially when they whistle close encounters of the third kind at each other
13it's over like 8 hours now i think
00,10sounds about right
13the canon story is the combine were sitting in some third alternate dimension behind Xen, and installed Nihilanth there to keep the vorts in line
lol.
Ooooooooooh. 7 hour war.
I see now.
my: yes you did
sad face
!cd
my : :'(
13even then though... the combine war strategy is pretty dumb.... apart from using stalkers to build their war machines, there isn't like a line of supply back to the combine overworld
Dr. Breen is evil though
well than that's good
00,10yeah she got hit by shrapnal
downer
13yeah, i did it last time i streamed hl2 even
I have to try that.

11,02Phase4: Not Blu-ray
00,02its blu-ray :P
11,025x the transfer rate of Blu-Ray :)
00,02they'll be doing the same thing they do on the wii
00,02ALLMOST identical disk, custom drive
00,10so it's a blueray with extra buffer time
goddamn geldon fordmun kills alot of people
11,02HD-DVD was cheaper to produce than Blu-Ray
11,02Nintendo confirmed it wasn't Blu-Ray
11,02Indeed, but they're not going to be dumb to use Blu-Ray and force users to install games just to go up to the same transfer speeds as that of DVD.
00,10yeah they had to go with faster speeds to make up for the lack of diskspace
00,02NewSuperBronyU, i do know its not hd-dvd, those disks had a higher cost to store 25GB than blu-ray and the drives were slower
11,02It's much faster than Blu-Ray
00,02the only benefit that hd-dvd really had over blu-ray was reuse of the old dvd infastructure with nearly zero modification
00,02big quotation marks around the 'nearly'
00,10the controllers cost 150+ I dont think they care of cost.
$150 for a controller? o.o

Too busy watching stream
00,02i am a gopher!
00,02is he actively avoiding health
00,10yeah
00,10playing it off as the suit is realy good
00,02XD
Wow
00,02BEARD
MmmmmBeard!
LAWL
Grow a beard? :D
Dat heroic line
"I played hide and go seek when I wasa CHILD!"
11,02Night all :)
nn
LAWL
XD
Dat Context change
/me yawns
Nowhe is drumming!
see you all later
:(
Seeing this makes me sad now
why?
Bye Moder- oh well
But then
FLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
And now it is scrapped
damn
dat foal in one
00,10ah yeah
00,02Vordox, send me some code?
00,10figured that was gonna happen to yah
00,02hmm
When hearing can nootice difference of 7 ms
No :P
00,02i would sugest java but i actually tried to write something in it today
00,02it actively resists programing
00,10and with this I PTFO
00,02SHOO BE DOO
Piss the Feck Out+
?
00,10yeah we do
00,10just think of the caht reactions
00,02it'll be derpy all over again
00,10chat*
LOL Ikr? XD
00,02so more spam
00,10night all
I'm gonna check GML langage
See the sound latency on it
Ello
I should've grabbed it first
But I don't know how it handles Vector graphics of Mysterbyben
00,02never liked those kinda things
00,02with purpose built languages
:P
And I still use it today
Haven't stopped me in my tracks yet(I only stop when I have to stop or build around)
00,02for prototyping sure
ALSOOOO!
LAWL
Dem faces with the song
00,02Vordox, you only really have one sound though
00,02the song
Oh no
There's more then song
00,02patcher is broke still
swing sound*
Put on endurance? :D
00,02i cant do 4x symetry on the wings
00,02which is disapointing
00,02i want to build this plane :(
Too complex for emulator :P
00,02Vordox, compiles to machine code
Basically, messing around with the software/Hardware itself
00,02well no, it runs in userspace
00,02so no hardware access
Aww.
It should help with the sound latency right?
00,02well you get access to the native audio api's
00,02which have either much lower latency or latency controll
Depending of if I can store the sound files into memory
That's one of the solutions, I just go to know HOW to do it
Hmmm
Great, more digging! :P
Not played through a server/Proxy
Boom :P
But I can't do java.
One of the languages I have yet not even drilled into
And hey, if it's a good system it might be warranted to be increased as well :P
00,02this might work now
While aiming for 7ms is the most ideal, or less

00,02this seems complete enough
Very neglected
I know! I'll watch Lesson Zero and see how Twilight uses her brains! :D
00,02ah
00,02i see
00,02but it is the api you need for real time audio
hey guys
Oh!

Is this the part of the HTMl5?
Or you reading Java?

It needs more cowbell
00,02Vordox, yes.... javascript is part of html5
00,02Vordox, html5 is not a language :P
00,02it a set of standards that happen to include javascript

00,02hmmm
00,02one more?
00,02Emil, well my simple ones work
*aspects
Yep.
If it doesn't work, blow it up!
The MythBusters way.
If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing~
Exactly.
If it doesn't work the way the myth claims, then you declare it busted and keep upping the ante until you get the desired result.
And then you keep going until something awesome happens. XD
Favorite explosion is cement truck.
00,02why does my music keep breaking
More than the cement truck one iirc xD
00,02so
lol
I stopped having cable years ago.
You're doing it right!
Did something just break?
Appropriate music is appropriate

Awesome music.

My dreams are few and far between. I dream maybe once a year?
NOT SAFE FOR WOOONA!
Hey everyone. I'm trying to make a ponysona for my husband, but I can't seem to escape the overused "yellow/orange/brown pony with brown hair" color scheme. Any pointers?
Oh. I don't remember my dreams. And the only time I remember a pony in my dream was sorta out of context.
its fun!~
:O
I'm back.................from my mom's computer...........
hi
No stream, i suposse?
I want to keep the brown hair, but it's very difficult to find good colors to go with it that haven't been done a million times. =\
I *was* Rarity in my dream, once. 'Twas awesome. ^_^
then i healed them all and placed them into my thrall
-_-
Whew!
Lol.
D:
Cheeaaater ;~;
:P
All them un-essential dots.
<adSurge: LOL, IKR?
MadSurge*
not at all :3
Even Fluttershy.
I'd be fine being her.
I'm at my mim's computer.......and IT'S REDUCED TO A QUARTER
Even though I dislike her.
and everypony loves you equally <3
Mom's*
except me
hold on, 'll refresh
ugh, have that feeling in my chest that tells me i need a hug.
thanks babe :3
<3
Because hugs, gurl.
Seriously, my last dream must have been in... April? And before that, probably the previous June or something.
I never dreamt ponies :P
^
The one I can barely remember was out of context.
I haven't hada a dream that I can remember in years >.>
His assistant. Celestia.
She didn't even say anything. ;_;

Bring scary on. I like to entertain scary.
you have to go through a bunch of Endermen in the hallucinations
My imagination's strong enough as it is awake.
Yeah, I read the topic and thought to see if anyone was in here at the moment:P
lol
Day dreaming was fun.
Just a couple of us right now
it is ^
Now, I'm too relaxed to do it anymore. =_=
I usually sleep
2 years I think..
I never joined the forums
Now all I do is think.
Oh, that explains
because of the hallucinations you have to go through
Meh. Hallucinations are alright if you can handle them.
Ive joined forums in the past and just dont really post
when I'm relaxed, I think a lot
You see. There are other things to worry about.
but I think of unnecessary things
Or... meh.
I 'unno.
They do say ignorance is bliss... haven't got time for ignorance though.
Too much to get done.
wait a minute, trying to find the meaning of bliss
Happyness. Contentedness. At peace.
The utter opposite of peace.
Are you still into the spyro series?
Hey, Nitt.
Yes. Mostly the originals. Haven't got/tried Skylanders.

but they arent for food anymore
hahaha
I think I made it up to 20 in breaking pots once.
is that smog? it looks a little hazy
am I the only one that likes the creepy music from Flutterex?
Never heard it. :P
does look a little blurry though
could be out of focus?
that's probably it
Are the other Pop'n'Cap games fun to play?
What's that?
Do you know how Plinko works?
But... Hmmm.
is that the thing from the price is right
And instead of dropping the ball, you shoot it out of a cannon.
anyone, anyone at all?
Erm. I just remember the movies.
Especially Peggle Nights
Trying to remember... >_<
:(

I would go open the log, but I'm afraid it might break.
Hang on, I'll go check.

08,01so... who's heard about this "Mohammad Movie"
alright
LOLJUBILIFE~
Movie?
/me glomps Saturn
08,01i just watched half of it
You mean the one responsible for all of the embassy attacks?
08,01and apart from the absolutely, and i use this word to its full extent, *insanely* inflammatory content and narrative, it's horribly shot and a chore to watch
08,01i read somewhere that it was made as a collaboration between fundie christians and fundie islamists to stir things up in the middle east
08,01GilDash|Reading: exactly
Well she's on her network, but probably idle
the "film" that's causing the riots eerywhere saturn?
08,01MirrorImage: yup
Apparently there's been an embassy stormed in Australia recently over it.
08,01if its purpose was anything other than to piss off muslims, it was not just badly thought out, but a literally mentally derranged thing to make
08,01anyhoos
05at first i thoguht you were talkign about "the Dictator"
10!pokemon
10no
10at least it's not tangrowth
08,01also, i have a sudden urge to dig up my cat that's buried in the garden, to see how the decomposition has progressed
...
That's...
Intersting Saturn.
08,01morbid, i know
Saturn - how long/
.......
08,01but i'm really interested in seeing it first hand, from a scientific perspective
08,01MirrorImage: just over a year now
08,01probably all bones by now
Saturn: It'll smell really, really bad.
in Australia, it's just a protest
08,01prince-dari: why are there porn adverts on that site...
08,01that seems... misjudged.
08,01or, to be honest, maybe not...
08,01anyhoos

And MewTwo moved to Cerulean Cave
in the commentary they said they wanted that forget thing to happen in the cinema,so that people would buy it again and again
reset time?
WE MUST STOP TIME!
And then they made Cide

brock, dont you mean "see one"?

ho-oh
Ho-Oh

hey, high-light this rainbow dash face :D
Suddenly a narator...
He saw Ho Oh ages ago
And the moral of the story is...merchandise.

before you went all evil like
hey everypony :)
Seriously
EVER GODDAMN ZELDA IS THE SAME
sure
Yeah I'd happily argue against that.
yeah
The ones that are samey are generally the handhelds, which (unsurprisingly) I don't like much.
Elemental based dungeons? check
And to be fair, it's a remake made by modders as opposed to the actual company (afaik)
tool that you get in every dungeon that lets you continue on
But the console ones have generally been decently differentiated, at least to some degree.
But actually, that's also kind of worse.
also a 3/7 Dungeon system
....oh wait.
can't wait for some holiday :D
I know me too :p
/me sighs
you do? Good.
But no srsly.
Its not too far away
