03I hate fullscreen games
12i wish it'd just keep the ratio
03but
13I misread monitors for monaters :<
/me goes back to idling
03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png
03Yes it is
But with GBA/GB and NES/SNES, it looks ugly
03they're still 4:3
03not 16:9
12i don't mean like full full screen
12maximize
12d
03I kinda don't get why
03it looks horrible
I know, but I don't care as I can see everything xD
03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png <- how can you not see everything there
Pics are blocked, I'll look at them later XD
Or in 10 mins
12drf
12that's when i draw the line
12and i can't stand shrinking it either
x.x
03Umbreon, stretching on VBA is like 4x worse
03and at least on the 3DS
03it doesn't lose aspect
03aspect-scaling is fine
03not very well, but it's bgetter than stretching
03-g
At least the DSi XL does it pretty well :P
03that's because the DSi XL doesn't scale
03it just has the same resolution as the DS
*just
ABOUT TIME, you lazy espeon
;3
12it's a matter of opinion drf
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXHUdvvHTkw
12LOL
12i forgot about the gameboy printer
0320%?
03is a lot more
12but the 3DS does a horrible job of it
12it actually is noticeable XD
03emulator stretching is really noticeable to me too
12it's not to me
12makes it easier to read
03not really
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyUEFi1qD-U
03this is me using a GameBoy player
03notice how it's not stretched out :P
12it has kind of a blur to it

12but that's probably youtubes doing
03well that too
03basically
03it's like
03then downscaling it again
03it looks bad
03not AS bad but yeah
12it's a matter of opinion dude :P
12some people like bad quality over screen size
Depends, I hate pixelated movies/images but games are fine :P
But that's why we should all use SVGs/Vectors, never get that issue (even though complex images are hard to make, sorta)
03have you ever tried playing Kitten Cannon in widescreen?
03Yes it's vectors, but it's messed up as the object physics were designed for 4:3
03:P
Blah, this isn't working

This won't end well
it seems like rap and top 40 just blends together
possibly because it does
03rap is one part of top 40
03but not all of it
They're probably hiding from you.
12They always do, till I get them in my room

seir probably had that "make everyone around me stupid" machine
06Should I just delete all of it?

Let's plot the mercenary shit.
04RIGHT
04I have 30 minutes- and hour
NO ONE CAN HEAR THIS, AMIRITE.
04roughly
I have...I don't know.
I'll be leaving soon
but let's start zomg plotting
we start with you and Xeli in an apartment
and then I run in
and shout "SEX"
04XD
and then we do that
04And it begins again
:D
and then
call the police
and our asses get hauled over
to the mercenary center
where we learn how to have sex properly
with protection
06come back
06see thi
06wow
04XD
I'm low on sugagr again
-g
or high
I don't know
one of them
anyway
04You weren't high/low 20 minutes ago
06ouch
hm
you get a needle
for raping little girls with
and then
04what
06Have a seat
04my
04I second Xeli's statement.
I get a taser
to stick up people's butts
for buttsex
derp
x_X
04I have that effect on people
XD
04Agreed.
I think the solution
idk
anyway
let's get back on topic
04First things first - names
do we know/not know either other? I'll assume the latter
okay
pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease?
04Noooooooo
D:
fine
04I had other...ideas.
/me shot
06winc.nvm
04no

06but either way
anyway
04Well NS

well
I can be called Seran...?
04If you're my sister that'll help get rid of all that UST that is bound to come up if you're not.

why don't we just go with
Rhy Feng.
or Rhy Fen.
04Sure.
first one? okay
04Rhy Valentine?>
06Dispenser
06Oh ahah
04/last suggestion
04XD
04Rhy Feng is nice.
only to you though ;p
yeah
04Short and simple.
we'll go with that
hurp
wow, semi-normal name
/me is proud
04Leonard Anderson, Nathan Hallmark, Rhy Feng.

I sound chinese
04I WANT A DIFFERENT SURNAME
/me searches
rofl
04Alright then.
06But I can't help to imagine him wearing a monocle I must work with that :3
04LOL
roflmao
I imagine Rhy as a cute little girl
who's somewhat hotheaded and outspoken
rofl
I can imagine that too
04You influence me too much.
XD
when's the wedding?
/me hides
04Dunno.
042 1/2 years maybe?
in a few years?
okay :D
we'll be like
06I'd magic bounce all over the planet for that
18 though
04XD
rofl Xeli
06I couldn't resist lol~
06and aww
04Because NS' name actually fits with my surname.
lolololol
yours slightly fits with mine
but
04Not really.
I propose that we call ourselves the Voidis family
or the Drakeshadow family
or something lame like that
04ugh no
:D
my name sucks
04NightDrake
048D

hivemind
derp
04I think we should have this sometime around 2015
hm
2015 seems a bit early
04for WW3?
yeah
04k then
I'd say ~2050
or 2085
how about 2051?
or 2039
042032
04anyway
2035
042034
I still think that's too early
0483
okay
2034 I can handle
04hurr durr
042034
2069
plz
ANYWAY
04seriously
04Too early>
04?*
04WW 21 and 2 happened within half a century of each other.
04But then I'
WW 21 and 2
XD
04I'd have to use a railgun as a sniper rifle.
xD
04That's no fun because there's no recoil.
x_X
fine
well then
like a damn lightsaber hurr durr
06better stock up on batteries
042062 then
04XD
rofl
2069
>:(
04fine
okay then
but hm
/me hides
rofl
his "friends"
/me hides
well
04You'd be the tech specialist.
04XD
04Ok
typically I don't like ranged weapons anyway
04You are the tech specialist and close quarters combat specialist.
06Well sure, we have the spy/engineer and the sniper
okay :D
06spy in the sense of stabbing people in the butt at least
rofl
/me hides
xD
04I'm the marksman and saboteur.
06I guess what's needed IS support afterall
I'm the techfag and close combat derpist.
Xeli should be all-rounded
04Xeli can maybe be the demolitions expert, espionage specialist and the all-rounder.
rofl espionage
04Don't get it.
04Or I could just cover both of you with the rifle.
first one
I LIKE THIS.
04XD
06I like this
06:3
04XD
06But that is quite interesting and would probably mean some kind of all-roundedness
yeah, but I'll still suck at aim
06but lets go with that formula
04Xeli
04what do you reckon you'd do well at then?
i know
protecting the world from devastation
04?
04LOL
/me hides
...LOL MENTAL IMAGES
me as some form of Jessie
and Xeli as an espeon instead of meowth
that would be Epic
04awesome
04anyway
"Nightshadow!"
04back to the topic
"Drake!"
"Espeon, that's right!"
oh man x-X
06o3o
06either way

Woah
03been a while since I used this
03NOW I'm a basement dweller :P
KNUCKLES?
12sigh
12why does no on see a need to set autofire for the direction arrows
12*one
03why would you ?
12i cant seem to well you know
03of course they don't, the codes are country-specific
03as for the pattern, you don't just need autofire then, you need a macro
03I got a solution for you though
03use the on-screen keyboard and Autoclicker
03have it click on the arrow keys
03in whatever pattern you want
03:P
12but i want to do other things while it's working
12i have already considered that path drf
03yeah i don't think that's gonna be possible then
03anyway bbl

you could just /umode2 -so

sec
come on BOPM

Alright, running script now
hope everyone is joined to at least one channel
uh
What's happening?
someone is attacking
This server?
stupid thing
the bots all pinged out
weird
well I'll leave it on for a bit

hi
hiya
i mayhave seen timmi before
iduno
his IP was a tor node too
Ascendant[BOPM] scan 245.255.103.97
CHECK -> Checking '245.255.103.97' for open proxies on all scanners
or not
I forgot BOPM fails
at doing that
it needs some configuration
CHECK -> All tests on 245.255.103.97 completed.
an open port to tell the proxies to try connect to, in order to see if they are open or not
[15:59:33] <+AmbernovaBOPM> CHECK -> DNSBL -> 97.103.255.245 appears in BL zone rbl.efnet.org (TOR exit server)
3.12 doesn't really
Hrmm...

and won't be as good
hrmmm
Can't seem to PM him.
I just left the default configuration

fyi
blah
freebsd
lol
I'll keep that on
did I accidentally unset that?
04ok
I unset it in hopes the bots would come and I could quickly dispatch them
04hi everyone
hi
looks like they didn't
I should deoper now lol
I'll leave BOPM on for now
and won't take much action
it doesn't scan properly
leaving in ~5-10 mins
okay cool
hopefully they don't come back x-X
that +f should handle things a little in the meantime
+j 3:10, single person can't join more than 3 times in 10 seconds,
could restrict it a little more and possibly still not affect any legitimate users though
04so
04what's going on?
12!cynder
x_X
well
and builds a database of known users, and knows when a botnet is connecting, and a normal users
it doesn't look like they knew how to
because if they did, they would have registered and joined the channel
do you have services logchan enabled?
I don't monitor services here
yeah
try enable logchan and check #services
uh...I normally don't oper up xD
sec
and not restart services?
/me waves claws around mysteriously
XD
only SRA does...at least in 1.8.x
Look at that baka.
o_O
TTEchidna wanted to talk to you about something.
alright
THAT WIKI
It lacks wondrous extensions which can make it prettyfied.
Like if statements.
One sec ill install parser functions.
yes.
:P
Man, I don't even know if it's still active or if they recycled it.
And I lack the password as well as access to that.
Because I've changed my email a couple times since 2004.
http://spyro.conforums3.com/
its still alive
Unbelievable.
figure it out and get me some access if you can :)
But why? Last post there's by replica handbags,
I want to incorporate it into spyroforum
Isn't SpyroForum just the successor site to it?
Well, it's doubtful any redirects can be made, since Conforums owns it...
Dont worry about technical details, I can take care of that
just try to get me access :)
The username's the default "admin" though.
Thanks.
Hrm.
Hi egg dear.
Hello.
TTEchidna, try to use expressions now.
and tellme if it works.
hello Darkeiya
http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Skelos_Badlands
works fine I assume?
Ooh, you got the switch statements working!
Yep
Though I feel corrupted. My first impression upon it now is "needs more roundycorners". orz
Just installed the extension for you guys/.
Awesome. :D
haha
hey, I just noticed
Once we're finished with it, this thing's gonna need eighteen servers to keep it from crashing.
Pfffff.
Darkeiya, do I know you from anywhere?
SFA, of couuuuurse.
You might. I tend to use the same name everywhere.
I'm getting the old team back together. We're gonna make the lone independent Spyro wiki AWESOME.
07nyan
*looks at Sor's page*
Well.
Well, I thought it was good :P
The fact that it exists is good.
07ohai
However everything could do with a powerup.
Now, why have I skulked back into the Spyro fandom?
are you going to clear the voices or something? XD
you could try /cs clear #Silverwings voices
not sure if you have access
07nope
ONE: SKYLANDERS. Now, why that? I hate it! AND THAT IS WHY.
do it manually then? XD
Oh also, heh.. http://www.spyropedia.ru/
07nah :3
well then
Ooh.
I CANNOT READ IT
After Pok√©mon... I cannot be fazed by any other fandom.
Eh, disregard that last bit. Seems to be wikias.
inb4 massive ranting tirade
HEY HON, BEFORE YOU START BITCHING, MIND UPLOADING THE OTHER TALISMAN IMAGES? :3
BUT it is important TTEchidna that you make an effort to try to get the SFA details for me :)
...yes I do.
For real?
/me idles
12nooooo
Hmm.
Well, it'll likely be nothing once Spyropedia... is souped up.
D:
Spyropedia just needs to get souped up.
Also that logo is ugly but that's a given thanks to Legend 1 Spyro.
It needs backlinks
07can't
07o3o
I didnt really work on a logo i just used the old one from spyroworld.
Hm.
TTEchidna, you wanna write news for spyroworld?
Considering all news is... Skylanders news...
*grumble*
news is news.
I also just noticed that darkspyro has like over a million posts now
Not AHT, not SSL...
YotD. As it should be.
hes down to 3500 members
and 600k posts
Hmm.
Hm.
I offered to buy darkspyro one day you know.
if I was in it now id be even more ruthless :P
Just kidding.
Hmm.
As for remaining talismans...
HERE
WE
GO
\o/
Though then that leaves the talisman pages to be deleted afterwards... hm.
Alrigh.
It really makes me feel weird to say this...
But the best thing to do?
GIFF ADIMZ POWAH PLZ
I think you might need to poke him with the name.
And speak more legibly.

04How do you think it should begin?
04Should we already know each other, or should we be strangers until we're put togther as a team?
strangers
04K
04But I guess we'd all write our own chapters from our own perspectives.

derp

Are we doing it in first-person or third-person?
04obviously
I prefer third-person
04Your choice.
04I prefer thi-
04Yeah

I tend to write like

don't like it
03I think I barely passed physics... but at the point where it's not actually going to help my GPA...
makes me sound like a retarded grandma or something

04We need the supreme executive chairman of the mercenary company first.

like compiling Timmi's penis

03nah
Pfft
XD
03but the really odd thing is
It hates you'
03it doesn't even say 'device unplugged', it straight up says NO NETWORK HARDWARE FOUND
03Like, the actual ethernet port
03on the motherboard
12hmm
12ghosttttt
Which Model DRF?
03Um
03it ends in 3500
One sec
I had a similar problem
03hm
03OK
Checking my netgear model now
/me flops
03LOL WTF
Netgear DGN3500
03Router Model
03Netgear WNR3500v2/U/L
LOOK AT MY LITTLE PONY
IT'S AMAZING
GIVE IT A LICK
(it tastes just like raisins)
Mine is this Netgear N300 WIRELESS GIGABIT ADSL2+ MODEM ROUTER
BY A STROKE OF ITS MANE IT TURNS INTO A NACHO
Or the DGN3500 XD
03yeah mine is that without the ADSL modem
THEN IT TURNS GAY
THEN IT TURNS INTO SPAIN
03since... well, we have cable
03but anyway how did you fix it?
http://www.netgear.co.uk/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/DGN3500.aspx
THEN IT TURNS BACK INTO PINKIE
(ooh that's dirty)
I didn't
03o.o
I just restarted my comp and router
03LOL WTF
Everything was fine after that
If that doesn't fix it, it's something to do with the Modem not supporting the Router
12hmm]
03well see, it works perfectly fine with wi-fi
03it's just the Ethernet that's not working, and ONLY my mom's computer
Hmm
Might be the port on the computer itself
03well
03it works if I plug the modem straight into the computer
03just not through the router
Hmm
How many ethernet ports does the router have?
034
03yes I tried all of them
/me licks
03...
03you know, that's a good point
03the router is gigabit, and the computer is probably only 10/100
03that would do it, eh? LOL
XD
how is?
03LOL
03I wish I could find some way to make it work though...

I could probably write some modules and add them to the servers instead of having to take them down and recompile
if there's a security update then I'll recompile

04Leafeon was never particularly popular.
/me eeps
12Drake tcg it was very popular
12XD
04H-uh
12still is rather expensive as well
04But it's not exactly memorable.
12lol
04When you think of the eeveelutions, it's very rarely the first one that comes to mind.
12considering i have a gigantic leafeon poster on my wall
12it's hard not to think of it
04XD
06When I think of them Leafeon is in fact one of the first that comes to mind o.O
12we're missing the most important one of all as well
12eevee has yet to make it
04odd
12eevee and leafeon are the two that havn't appeared
