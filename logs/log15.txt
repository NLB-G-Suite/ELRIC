12drf
12bill scares me
03Bill?
12the pokemon character
03XD
03how so
12i was playing pokemon vietnamese crystal
12and i wanted an eevee
12so i went to see him
12http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/Bill.png?t=1303755506
03hold on, busy
12kk
12he also mentioned something about his husband doing nothing
03LOL
03also WTF?
03why do you have it stretched
03you should aspect scale it
06lol vietnamese crystal
12i don't really care drf
12also my emulator did that, not me
12sorry drf
12had to call western technical college
03that's why you tell the emulator to do x4 rather than fullscreen
12i applied for computer support tech, and they put me in computer support spec
12XD
12Espeon, i got my umbreon in the game :D
12http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/HULA.png?t=1303756787
03owwwwww that seriously hurts my eyes
03I'm really sensitive to stretched out video LOL
03and images
03w/e
12pff
U MAD
03if someone took the Mona Lisa
Abd gnn
03and made her fatter by stretching her
03people would be mad
*and hmm
03so :/
LOL
12drf
12i saw a movie where they set the mona lisa on fire
12on purpose
03um
03k?
12people would probably be mad as well if the authentic copy of the mona lisa was set on fire
So how fast was your connection before the router lol?
0350mbps
STERIODNET
Now you can upload more junk for me!
03dude
03I'm leaving today'
When you get back lol :P
03September?
And your PC is going to poof like last time XD
Well, hmm
03though
12http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/Pokemon_VietCristal.png?t=1303757033
03my house's upload speed is actually a little better than this one
12there drf, happy now?
Take your PC home and profit?
03yep XD
03just set VBA to do x4 size
12then it doesn't take up the whole screen
12i'm kind of obsessive about this game taking up the whole screen D:
Same here :(
03LOL why
03I hate fullscreen games
12i wish it'd just keep the ratio
03with two monitors it just gets annoying
12but black out the rest of the screen
We need to use every pixel
03but
03doing that is stretching the pixels
Well with other and bigger games (N64/PS1) that isn't as big as a problem
13I misread monitors for monaters :<
/me goes back to idling
03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png
03that's relatively big anyway
03Yes it is
But with GBA/GB and NES/SNES, it looks ugly
03they're still 4:3
03not 16:9
12i don't mean like full full screen
12but i mean like the original screenshot
:–∑ / :–ó / :3 / :¬≥ / —î: / E: / :–≠ / –Ñ: / :—ç
12maximize
12d
/me trolls DRF by putting Pokemon Red in the Gameboy player on an 52in TV, putting it on Fullscreen then zooming it in to get the game to fill up every pixel
And that's how I play Crystal version :P
03I kinda don't get why
03it looks horrible
I know, but I don't care as I can see everything xD
03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png <- how can you not see everything there
Pics are blocked, I'll look at them later XD
Or in 10 mins
12yay finally caught a water pokemon
12drf
12what looks horrible is playing a DS game on the 3DS
12that's when i draw the line
12and i can't stand shrinking it either
x.x
03Umbreon, stretching on VBA is like 4x worse
03than a DS game on the 3dS
03and at least on the 3DS
03it doesn't lose aspect
03aspect-scaling is fine
03that's what the 3DS does
03not very well, but it's bgetter than stretching
03-g
At least the DSi XL does it pretty well :P
03that's because the DSi XL doesn't scale
03it just has the same resolution as the DS
But it's the same res and all, jut big pixels XD
*just
ABOUT TIME, you lazy espeon
;3
12it's a matter of opinion drf
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXHUdvvHTkw
03no, it's scientific, what the 3DS does is a lot more minor than what VBA does
12LOL
12i forgot about the gameboy printer
03stretching 192 pixels to 240 is like what
0320%?
03Stretching 128 or so pixels to like 800
03is a lot more
12but the 3DS does a horrible job of it
12it actually is noticeable XD
03emulator stretching is really noticeable to me too
12it's not to me
12makes it easier to read
03not really

03this is me using a GameBoy player
03notice how it's not stretched out :P
03all I did was crop the Nintendo crap off on the edges
12it has kind of a blur to it
12but that's probably youtubes doing
03well Umbreon, that's because it's not true pixel for pixel
03well that too
03basically
03it's like
03enlarging the game like the 3DS does
03then downscaling it again
03it looks bad
03not AS bad but yeah
12it's a matter of opinion dude :P
12some people like bad quality over screen size
12like bad quality large screen size over small little screen size
Depends, I hate pixelated movies/images but games are fine :P
NATO authorized war planes to assassinate him via air strike, but he's unharmed.
But that's why we should all use SVGs/Vectors, never get that issue (even though complex images are hard to make, sorta)
03well HML
03have you ever tried playing Kitten Cannon in widescreen?
03Yes it's vectors, but it's messed up as the object physics were designed for 4:3
03:P
Lololol, well why not the nice anamorphic?
But anyway, pokemon shouldn't have an issue
And I misread that, so yeaah, it'll look off
Blah, this isn't working

eeewwiiieee
I like sweet potato :3
yummmmmmmmmmmm
/me doesnt
had mashed sweet potato with the roast pork on sunday
and a load of veggies and stuff
yay roast pork
blechsicles
03LOL @ this fortune cookie fortune I found
03"Call a friend. Your voice will bring a smile"
dont think ive had roast pork
03that or it'll scare them away
we just it roast i think.
i prefer roast beef
or duck
:D
actually i think beef is our just "roast"
roast potatoes!
and yorkshire pudding!
<...<
and gravy!
:D
what is yorkshire pudding?
it's like batter
but in the shape of a cup
sort of
hmm
look up pictures!
o.O wait wawt?
how can batter be in the shape of a cup?
tht'd make it a little... unsafe to eat.. wldnt it?
lol
yorkshire pudding: http://assets.mydish.co.uk/interface/members/241623/200982112572954-364208-26843-114006.jpg
larger ones are sometimes used by filling them full of gravy and putting the meat inside them
tht looks nothing like pudding.
I guess it's kinda like a muffin
lots of things are called a pudding in the UK
what with our silly language
hahah
I mean, a black pudding is really a type of sausage
:P
... thats so confusing.
well, it's a blood sausage
black pudding sounds more like chocolate pudding.
generally sliced and fried with a full breakfast
black pudding is black/dark brown in colour
dark chocolate. yum breakfast. ^.^
lol.
:D
I want hash browns!
me too
hi ari
thats random cat
so very random
<...< wait..
what's ur definition of hash browns?
lol
they're like crunchy shredded fried potato, right?
I'm not sure what they are exactly
yesh
yesssssssssss
lol
yummmmmmmmmy
also, spanish omelette is pretty damn awesome
yes it is
:o
/me is hungry ._.
whoever thought of combining omelette with fried potato, I want to hug them
/me wants some type of fried patato now.... fries, hash brown
patato casserole that i had in spanish class once...
i want hot friez
I'd like roast potatoes
those are so good
all crunchy and salty
:3
04prolly
04:3
:( i'm hungrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry
roast potatoes are actually roast potatoes?
D:
roast potatoes are potatoes, roasted
yes
03my mom's here
o.O
haha
04k

i sry...
hmm
-__- bro is so mean, he wont get eeet for me.
so rude
haha, mine acts like i'm his freaking waitress.
spoiled lil....
pffftt
If my bro was like that, he would get a swift kick to the nuts.
if mine wasnt built like a ton of bricks and hadnt used his muscles b4... then maybe. but he's stout and bosy and not afraid to hit.
and i bruise easy.
lol same :P
my brother can lay someone out that ia twice his size. :/
I'm not a nasty bro to my sister
but I'm not very strong either :P
/me hugs Cat :P
my bro is just blehness
my brother scares me. when he's mad.
my sister is probably stronger than I am
:X
considering she does horseriding and I do computers
One time he pushed me for noooo reason so i kicked them then he tackled me then i punched then he through me then i bit him and got in trouble >:|
him*
D:
:O only cuz he had evidence of said bite v_v
I have hit my sister once
was it for a good reason :o?
and that was because she was sat next to me poking me and making stupid noises while I was stressed trying to repair a computer
well there ya go
she asked for it
and she wouldnt go away no matter how much I told her to
so I kicked her in the head
xD
she then snapped my phone in half, threw the bits at my head and stuffed my schoolbag in the toilet
she was made to buy me a new, much better phone
:P
....
x) oh wow
hmm suddenly my brother looks like an angel.
lolz
Cat, are you the oldest?
lol Cat
:3
yes
/me is the youngest
we generally get on very well
lol not I
maybe if he wasnt so bossy v_v. we are only a year apart.
I'm the opposite of bossy :P
my sis is 4 years younger than me
/me noticed :P
oooh
:o
he is dead
I dunno :(
errr

and Proto
D:
/me bursts into flames
/me eats the flames
eeww, I ated burnt kitty
:O
burnt hair is really stinky D:
YES :O
indeed
I once accidentally set some arm hair on fire playing with a lighter
it wasn't pleasant
How did you manage that?
hahah
it smells bad
and I can mod a lighter so that it shoots out lighter fluid
mew
and then you can put it into a cup and it will go up in flames
yes
and will people being redirected to another channel see the topic of the channel with the limit?

I'm gonna be MAGICALIZING your wiki
12Yay!
unlimited torrents, up to 250GB HDD, with 3GB ram

12Woah, how'd you know?

Thank goodness
Persona, Fursona...what do you call a dragon then?
7Hmm.
Are we the only country in the world to NOT celebrate easter monday properly?
Not you, dear. Go back to making cookies.
lol
I mean, I buy something, there's my name on a credit card report
oh, no
Its all done secretly
You send me $ on paypal
Yes Credit, that is why we should watch out :P\
I will pay for the seedbox
Including the ink spills
and it will be under a fake name
and you will get to access it
Save the papers, not the seals :P
12who here uses virtualboyadvance?
The funny thing is? Printer ink is more expensive then drugs. :P
...and its not over ><;;;
So its like a proxy, if you think about it
and you get fill root access (its a vps)
full*
It's even worse here :P
12Ok <3
One cart for around 19$ IIRC locally
and a dedi IP
cheapest one is $5/mo
mmmmm kiting
or what's that called
fffffs brb
$4.50 for the first 2 months if you pay in a 3 month block
Baaai
:3
"You know how drug cartels could make more money? ...Replace the drugs with printer ink and toner and they'll be richer then Bill Gates!"
idk what its called
:P
and it'll be legal XD
Until someone finds a way to get high on toner. :P
Oh, and you get a SolusVM VPS control panel, so you can track your usage
And solder, well for me that is
ohai Drake
(Inhaling Soldering fumes is a bad idea, unless you want to be lightheaded from the lead going into your blood)

:–∑ / :–ó / :3 / :¬≥ / —î: / E: / :–≠ / –Ñ: / :—ç
Sneas :3
okay I'm happy with the amount of ops now
Well, they both are due to those odd horomones you might have ;o
but that was over half a year ago
might have?
:3
Fine, you have screwed up horomones and all
lol Sneas always makes you go ":3" when i used to make you go that XD hmm...now that i think abou it ive never made you go ":3" XD
12right now i'm pondering if there is a way to make people call you faster in pokemon crystal

12well what do i set the frameskip to since i'm not entirey sure what it is
lol?
/me yawns
02Night all~
And yes, I am a Sonic fan. But I prefer normal echidnas to Knuckles. Doesn't mean KTE isn't the coolest thing in the Sonic series though.
Bai Ray
And the TT stands for Time Traveling.
02Bai~
nvm :P
/me downloads VBA and a rom of Yellow
Just cause :P
12cool

12Figured, the only people who like them are sonic fans, no offence, I'm part of stranger fandoms
13good night
Go to options.. and do frameskip
12o-O
I was kinda joking Umbreon, but that makes the game go faster
Like, FAST faster XD
12i didn't see it but oka
o-o
13nighty night
Set it to 7 and change throttle to 150%
Well, I'm not in the Sonic fandom, nor is the echidna that is TTE a Sonic-style echy.
12rright now i wonder if i can get phonecalls by standing still
12K cool
12What else you like?
Oh joy
You know what, I like 3d
Hmm.
Hmm?
So, donde est√° el super in charge hombre?
wb Ace derp
derp
derp
;o
/me stabs Lyon / Drake
12lol wut?
umm
/me squees at yellow
Hello.
"Ash is playing the SNES, time to go!"
LOL SNES, that's awesome
;o
nah, I prefer the Genesis over that
As long as your not violating someone's trademark, copyright, patent, revealing a trade secret, or violating a contract, you're all good
is it illegal to sell something though that can be used for those purposes
12lol
I guess though CDs and dvds can be used that way
I have BOTH
or selling someone a knife that they use to stab someone
And I love them both in their own special way ;P
I forgot what I got for my starter in Yellow XD
then again this comes from someone who was thrust kicking and screaming into Nintendo systems
I have heard of assisting in copyright infringement being a charge
I HATED the Gameboy Color at first
But only with The Pirate Bay
I LOVED it XD
It was like, my first real gameboy
washed out colors, very dim screen, cramped buttons
It's gray grounds, I haven't seen much case law about assisting in copyright infringement, especially in Canada, and I monitor that stuff carefully
12i choose pikachu as your starter
......FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
How could I forget
That shows how long it's been since I played Yellow
I prefered my Game Gear over that for a long time
I didn't like any of the GG games XD
12still haven't gotten any calls
12where are those 3
As long as there's some legal use for those things, and you make it clear through BS that what you're selling is intended only for that purpose, then you should be good
it was far more comfortable to play, the screen was easier to see, plus more colorful
The only people I've seen charged with assisting are large torrent sites
I mean, the Gameboy Color would have been better if it just had A FREAKING BACKLIGHT
none of this pasive ilumination BS
WHERE IS
THE MAN IN CHARGEY
BECAUSE I NEED
Umbreon, DirectDraw or Direct 3D?
something to be turned on
I perfer DirectDraw lol
12huh?
Slightly more blurry, but fine
12i dunno
Under Options and video
Try it out on fullscreen
(render method)
12doesn't matter to me
emulation on the PSP is today a very good compromise
12O_o
12your funneh
a comfortable controler like layout along with being able to play Gameboy Color games
12he's dead
the fuck
plus a brighter backlit screen
GTFO MY CONNECTION
12lol
the fuck
o-o
We can wait until the 3DS store comes out, then we'll see
odd things with IRC going on today o_o
ZNC just looks like it's fucking itself
I'll check on the server later
I am just waiting to see where it goes
ok
early adopters of game systems have tended to be burned by the choices for their new system
Hi Altair
:3
...f'real?
oh duh he isnt here derp
:P
with the 3DS my attitude now is to wait and see what happens
12nah
bbl lunch
12Just quiet
o-o
Ah.
12Hmhmhm
12I'm a guy btw
http://i.imgur.com/9TYHP.png < Lol
I am pretty sure that once they get past the exploiting the gimick of 3D stage that something interesting to me will be released
GTFO MY CONNECTION
Umbreon, does that screenshot look good?

12i need a thunder and water stone

03Finally home
wb drf and bbl
03um
03k
03LOL
Ohai DRF XD
03hi
03the computer is all set up, just no speakers right now
03for the simple reason that I need to figure out where to put said speakers
03my bedroom is not quite suitable for surround sound - while *I* could easily install it, my parents would kick me out of the house LO
03L:L
03*LOL>
mine don't mind me having a stereo in here
Danny~
XD
03well
03I got home, right
DRF being disowned
03I'm unpacking
03I have the radio on
03my parents are like "You're home! Turn it down"
03I'm like wow, that didn't even take 30 seconds
I think it started as a meme.
They don't miss you at all
03I heard some new songs on FM radio that I didn't know about
03seeing as how I didn't have a radio at home
Then loads of /b/tards actually liked the show, lol.
and believe me the stereo I have could rattle the windows
So they made ponychan.
meh FM
03so can mine if I turn it up all the way
03LOL
enjoy your multipath and distortion
03my stereo does AM too but nothing good to tune it to :P
12Those sick... god....
you mean no rap where it all consists of "F this F that and F you"
XD
Yeah
03hey now
03some of the new songs I heard were pop
03actual singing :PO
03-O
Amazing, actual singing for once
but top 40 radio is in such sad shape these days that its rare
adult contemporary is where its at
12If he needs help tell him I'm free ;3
Haha, ok.
Adult music amrite ;P
Seduction tunes ;3
/me shot
no
03you mihgt lioke it
03-o
12o-o
get your mind out of the gutter HML
I already have one like that here
Pft, no thanks
KXXO 96.1
12I'm a furry guiz >;3
along with countless others
03it's not top 40, is the thing
03it's "any music with a beat"
03which I like :)P
03*:P
Good for you.
Lv6 Pikachu vs lv 190 Articuno
12;D
This won't end well
it seems like rap and top 40 just blends together
possibly because it does
12Anywho, where are the girls?I'm tired of all these men
03rap is one part of top 40
03but not all of it
They're probably hiding from you.
from what I heard its the bulk of it
12They always do, till I get them in my room
we have a top 40 station out of Seattle owned by "The Evil Empire" but I don't listen to it at all
03Clear Channel;?
12Cuz my room is so nice and fluffy
yes
the smaller ones I find far more interesting
but I have a large choice for FM
thanks to this
12sigh drf XD

Big thing

I have had up to 150 miles
Night
no
that is for receive only
12finally one of them called
12i got the water stone and a vaporeon
a Sangean HD Radio tuner popped up on eBay
http://cgi.ebay.com/Sangean-HDT-1X-/290559526100?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item43a6b284d4
I suspect this uses a common chipset in comparison to mine
plus drf, you might like it
This is a HD radio tuner with high audio quality digital optical output.
I spoke too soon when I said none existed
03my Insignia does optical out too
03but it's recompressed so it's not really worth it
03k bbl
I can't believe one of these showed up
http://cgi.ebay.com/Carver-TX-11b-AM-FM-Stereo-Tuner-Excellent-TX11-TX11b-/190525582729?_trksid=p4340.m1374&_trkparms=algo%3DPI%26its%3DC%26itu%3DUCC%26otn%3D5%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D8719193472234335868

12I guess so
i feel like something buggin you out doc, you alright?
12Yeah
let me know man and be str8 up about it
i also have a slight feeling that its me that is bugging you out... if i am let me know str8 out tho. (im not being disrespectful i just wana get to the bottom of things)
12nah
12just dont feel well, my sleeps all messed up
aww man same here
im getting used to it tho. i only got 3 hours of sleep last night and i havnt got a chance to sleep yet
and im doing just fine but on any unsuspected day of the week my body just takes a 10 hour knock out nap
12Yeah, I took a short nap earlier, but that's it, I haven't gotten a full nights sleep
12K.O. :3

06holy floof
rofl
04XD
I love Leo
he's cool
but all the DMs are cool, so
there's so much Lyon x Seran/Seiranyu in this chapter
I'm serious
if you read the flashbacks then derp
04XD
06Lol
its a bit,,, big
06oh wow the flashbacks
yeah
there's a lot
one for each chapter
but the flashbacks are nice
04And cute
look at these bakas
ohai Ace
06lolthewordbaka
04I hate you for not putting any serious Lyon x Seir/Seran in there.
/me shot
why am I awake
I was going to Drake ;3
04WHY DIDN'T YOU
probably next chapter
or the one after
or the last one
which is the one after that one
04But she's- you know.
yeah I know
but true love, huh
06But now it seems like Lyon would gradually turn insane
06oh wait that goes well with everything
06proceed
/me dies
04XD
04NS
xD
04If there's no admission, in any form, I will kill you.
admission?
oh right
well
I'll give Lyon his corny line
"SERAN/SEIR I LOVE YOU WHY DID YOU HAVE TO"
04No need for a corny line
;3
04Get creative
fuck you
fuck being creative
I'm not creative
go die in a fire
04But that'd hurt.
XD
06I'm creative in all the wrong ways.
rofl
well Xeli, did you enjoy that chapter?
06And Drake, would the "fuck you" hurt or the fire part hurt the most?
06:3
06Yes I did
XD
04XD
the next chapter a lot of crap is explained
04Knowing NS, both would.
/me hides
especially the stuff about Seran going through her cabinet of crap
rofl
well...it does depend, Drake... ;3
06There's a whole MGS-worthy bowl of stuff to explain probably.
04Knowing you and your fascination with shoving dildos up my ass...yeah.
06dot
oh okay yeah
but god damn it
Reminiscence is almost over ;_;
04And none of my fanfictions have ever gotten past halfway!
rofl
I'm surprised I'm nearly finished
although
06I must find suitable manlytears.jpg for the grand finale.
06And it has survived for long so
I still have Leader's Legacy and Seran's Story to do
06you're awesome
06:3
and XD
04XD
the ending is also depressing derp
but also very happy
just like everything I do
derpderpderp
hurp
12 Hello, Jazzy_Wolf and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
hurp in your derp
hurrrrrrr
04I am temtped to make an idiot joke.
but hell, I'm still trying to decide on what to do for the ending
04But I shall refrain.
XD
04tempted*
I know what I want to do
but
I kinda want to change it
so
I'm being extremely indecisive
I'm not good at endings ;-;
04How about
04the next chapter
They all die.
The end.
04You make Seran somehow live
04That would be nice.
Yeah, we'll have Reminiscence 2: Revival of SERAN!!!
04XD
and then I'll make a fic
04Needs more exclamation marks
where Lyon and Seir both join TD
now that would be awesome
06Everything seems good
06and suddenly ALIENS
06or demons
rofl
06Or just no
04XD
04No Seran, you are Team Light/
Reminiscence: Altair Universe 1
.
Alternate*
the fuck
06how the
04what
04how
don't know
I scream at Altair too much probably
06Yay alternate storylines hidden behind the excuse of lolmetaphysics
rofl
06Directed by: 6,6Michael Bay
rofl
you know what
06EXPLOSIONS
06what
I should replace the characters of Reminiscence
with you, Drake, me, Altair, etc.
and then
!!!
04ohgod
04that
04would
04be
04awesome
XD
Xeli would definitely be Leo
06silly Espeon you're an Espeon you can't even control a spaceship
04I wonder who I would be.
04Hmm
06Well duh those characters did come from somewhere
Altair would be Rex or Kommander Kulesz
dunno who'd be The Hensh though
04Make Altair the Kommander
or I could just got for the excuse
"he's too awesome to be replaced!"
rofl Altair as Kommander Kulesz
04Make Shiny Synix
lolol
Shiny would actually be The Hensh
06I read that as Shiny Shinx
04WAIT
04Actually
06obvi- what
with his sarcasm
04I shouldn't make that joke
rofl
04It's cause more flame wars
XD
04It'd
hm
Captain Bronwyn...
and Cathy
also
lol
Rex, Cathy and Leonard are pretty much the only normal names
in the entire thing
06You do enjoy your strange names afterall.
derp
Cathy was from the original dream that inspired the fic
so I kept the name
04Why does the odd name award go to her?
06Drake those names sound like
06alright it's a tie
06I guess
06yayxale
06!!!
XD
I had some more
04xd
Calasi is strange as fuck though
oh yeah
Draconis
but that's coming from me
04Victor. Irres. Scientia. Morva. Rena.
who has Seiranyu and Ralexinor
and also Kommander Kulesz and The Hensh
>mfw
04Who has Irres.
as well as Syril/Syril/Synix
04I doubt anyone knows Irres has a story behind his name.
and Rathicus
and Dragoran
and Merigal
/me amount of characters can be counted on one hand-master race
and shit
/me dies
rofl
04XD
but Xeli
Leonard is awesome
I love your character
06oh the images
x_X
06But that is good
somehow
I attribute Rex and Leo to being almost brothers
06it's like an extreme exeggeration of my own traits irl for comedy and win purposes
XD
04XD
and then it's automatic Seir/Seran x Lyon
and you know what
yesterday I realised in the second chapter/First Mission
I typed Drake instead of Lyon for the first half of the story
go read it again
you'll see it
and then I was "OH FUCK"
04XD
seriously
I need to fix it
but lazy and I can't edit TST's
oh Xeli
04But seriously.
04I'm nowhere near as stupid as your portray me.
can you do me a favour and delete the Reminiscence topic on TST or at least remove the author's notes?
04At least not anymore.
rofl
Lyon is a lot smarter than he was
with seir
seir probably had that "make everyone around me stupid" machine
06Should I just delete all of it?
it's up to you Xeli
I'll repost it
04XD
I just want the ANs gone
06I'll just remove everything then. 'tis tidier :3
derp XD
I can do HoR's fine
as I still have my account lol
06Now you can commence the copypasta
derp
Drake
did I ever tell you LL's storyline?
04?
04yup
derp
04Though I forget the details
I like the storyline
do you know Seran's Story's one?
04Isn't just how Seir turned bad?
04If so, then yes.
04well
04not 'bad'
yeah
just went over to TD
being Kommander Kulesz is a meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeanie
because*
not being
04XD
>typos
also
Let's plot the mercenary shit.
GATHER 'ROUND, XELI, DRAKE.
04RIGHT
LET'S TALK IN SECRET.
04I have 30 minutes- and hour
NO ONE CAN HEAR THIS, AMIRITE.
04roughly
I have...I don't know.
I'll be leaving soon
but let's start zomg plotting
okay so
we start with you and Xeli in an apartment
and then I run in
and shout "SEX"
04XD
and then we do that
04And it begins again
:D
and then
people notice us
call the police
and our asses get hauled over
to the mercenary center
where we learn how to have sex properly
with protection
06come back
06see thi
06wow
04XD
I'm low on sugagr again
-g
or high
I don't know
one of them
anyway
04You weren't high/low 20 minutes ago
Xeli gets a sledgehammer for banging penises
06ouch
and Drake
hm
06you're a girl you're not allowed to speak of such because you don't feel the pain in your mind
you get a needle
for raping little girls with
and then
04what
06Have a seat
04my
04I second Xeli's statement.
I get a taser
to stick up people's butts
for buttsex
derp
I think Drake got me high
he always gets me high
x_X
04I have that effect on people
06We need to get some elephant tranquilizers or something in here to use on her when this happens
XD
04Agreed.
I think the solution
04While it is amusing, it gets disturbing after a while.
would be for Drake to leave temporarily
idk
anyway
let's get back on topic
how should we start it, Drake?
04First things first - names
do we know/not know either other? I'll assume the latter
okay
I'm your sister
pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease?
04Noooooooo
D:
fine
04I had other...ideas.
/me shot
06winc.nvm
I'll be your brother
happy?
04no
04that's
04that's worse
06Anything that gives you a penis is not acceptable
T_T
fuck, Xeli
that was my lifelong dream
you ruined it
>:(
04XD
06You can still get your dose
06but either way
anyway
04Well NS
06use lock-on on the topic
yeah that
well
I can be called Seran...?
04If you're my sister that'll help get rid of all that UST that is bound to come up if you're not.
XD
04If you know what UST is.
not really
universal sex desire?
desire starts with t
I think
anyway
that's beside the point
NAMES PLZ
04Unresolved Sexual Tension
Ah
04RIGHT
I was close
well
we can always have sex
04Well
04What do you want your name to be?
this conversation is interesting
/me sit
06I can't come up with a name out of nowhere so cry
04Adrian?
04Aran?
04I like Nathan
I think Xeli should be Leonard Anderson
:U
you should be Nathan, Drake
it suits you
04Yeah
04Nathan Hallmark
imo Xeli is awesome as a Leonard
04/random
rofl
sure
i wanna be
"derp"
hurp
woo
Drake you know how lame I am at names
/me bes a Starfox o.o
I could be
04Jill?
Alexandra
/me shot
but anything female
06Yeah
does not suit me
06=3
:D
06And lol
04Alexandra or Alexandria?
neither
it doesn't suit me
06Be a herm or something
xD
/me dies
Seran sort of suits me
rofl
Seiranyu
04wut
lol
04my mind
04is blown
nah no rem nicks
lololol
hm.
thanks for the mental image
someone should take the name "Moron"
like every one of the names in my fanfic is either intended to be a person I know, a god, or some japanese shit i translated from google
:I
I could be Syriel @ Drake
but that's not a like
normal name
04NS enough with all the weird names.
04It's like Aerith and Bob
04Syriel and Nathan
04heh
xD
04Syriel killer.
rofl
/me hides
LOL
oh yeah btw
Seir is pronounced "seer"
04Ooooooh
04I thought
Seiranyu is pronounced Se-ran-you
is that
04Seri was pronounced like 'were'
see-yur
04Seir*
or seeeeer
rofl
xD
neat
Kulesz is pronounced Cool-lesh
Hensh is pronounced...hensh
Synix is pronounced sin-ix
04Radiel is pronounced 'Raid-eel'

04or 'Rahd-eel'
well
second one more so
actually
no
04Lyon is pronounced 'lee-on'
04everyone thinks it's pronounced like 'lion'
I thought it was Rad-ee-L

rofl
My name is Derp.
Wanna know how that's pronounced? :(
04I noticed
XD
g3wdehcieuw3gtedhyfirdew3hgdedfedhwjdjn

04Anyway
but hurr
06Xale \o/
06done
06.
04Leonard Anderson, Nathan Hallmark, and...Seran
did you think Kulesz was pronounced other than the way I told you just then?
XD
04I think we can go with that
Seran nah
04fine
poop
Rai or something?
kih-yule-ss
xD
04Rye
/me hides
rofl
Rye would be fine tbqh
Bread.

Rye Bread.
Rhy maybe?
04Exactly
04XD

Ri Li
04and it looks cooler than Rai
Rai looks cooler
>words
>looks cooler
04Ping

04Like Mulan.

Dragonkeeper

04Rhy Anderson
/me hides

THE MATRIX
04Rhy Garret

04XD
lmfao
you guys both sound english
I sound chinese
04I WANT A DIFFERENT SURNAME
/me searches
rofl
Nathan Hallmark sounds fine
06Nathan Hallmark sounds like some kind of adventure game character. And not saying that's a bad thing.
04Alright then.
06But I can't help to imagine him wearing a monocle I must work with that :3
04LOL
roflmao
I imagine Rhy as a cute little girl
04I imagine her as a merciless killer.
who's somewhat hotheaded and outspoken
rofl
I can imagine that too
04You influence me too much.
XD
we're the perfect pair after all
when's the wedding?
/me hides
04Dunno.
042 1/2 years maybe?
in a few years?
okay :D
we'll be like
06I'd magic bounce all over the planet for that
04Not legal age yet obviously.
18 though
04XD
rofl Xeli
I so want everyone here to come
04It's funny
06I couldn't resist lol~
especially you, Altair, Sneas, Shiny and Skylands
06and aww
04Because NS' name actually fits with my surname.
lolololol
Drake
yours slightly fits with mine
but
04Not really.
I propose that we call ourselves the Voidis family
or the Drakeshadow family
or something lame like that
04ugh no
:D
my name sucks
04NightDrake
048D
maybe 8D
8====D~~~~
/me hides
okay that side
aside
04We get off topic so easily.
derp
well
what do then?
04Ok
I want to live in antarctica
04to the beginning
at the beginning
rofl
06what
[21:04:09] <Drake> to the beginning
timestamps
XD
04XD
hivemind
derp
04I think we should have this sometime around 2015
but anyway Drake
hm
2015 seems a bit early
04for WW3?
yeah
04k then
I'd say ~2050
or 2085
04that's a bit late.
how about 2051?
or 2039
042032
04anyway
2035
042034
I still think that's too early
0483
okay
2034 I can handle
04hurr durr
I like the number
042034
2069
plz
ANYWAY
04seriously
04Too early>
04?*
no Drake, let's make it 2500
04WW 21 and 2 happened within half a century of each other.
so we have awesome technology and shit
04But then I'
WW 21 and 2
XD
xD
04That's no fun because there's no recoil.
x_X
fine
04and plasma is overused.
well then
I like plasma
I want a fucking plasma sword/blade
like a damn lightsaber hurr durr
06better stock up on batteries
042062 then
04XD
rofl
2069
>:(
04fine
yay
okay then
but hm
04Xeli is the heavy weapons man.
04With a gun called Sasha.
/me hides
rofl
his "friends"
/me hides
04No, I'm not actually sure what his role was going to be.
well
04You'd be the tech specialist.
and person who stabs people in the butt
04XD
04Ok
with a plasma sword
typically I don't like ranged weapons anyway
04You are the tech specialist and close quarters combat specialist.
okay :D
06spy in the sense of stabbing people in the butt at least
rofl
xeli can be the stealth clown
/me hides
06I'm not Robert Bowling and I'd rather wax my privates.
xD
04I'm the marksman and saboteur.
06I guess what's needed IS support afterall
I'm the techfag and close combat derpist.
Xeli should be all-rounded
04Xeli can maybe be the demolitions expert, espionage specialist and the all-rounder.
rofl espionage
06must resist overly obvious pun
lololol
04NS unlocks doors, Xeli gets me past the guards, and I sabotage the mehcanics while Xeli uses explosive charges to cover our exit and NS wipes the floor with anyone who gets in our way.
04Don't get it.
04Or I could just cover both of you with the rifle.
first one
I LIKE THIS.
04XD
06That sounds rather dynamic and the combination of sneaky and blowing things up sounds perfectly illogical
06I like this
06:3
04XD
lolol
06But that is quite interesting and would probably mean some kind of all-roundedness
yeah, but I'll still suck at aim
06but lets go with that formula
04Xeli
so therefore I stay away from guns because everyone else is in danger of being shot
04what do you reckon you'd do well at then?
Drake
i know
protecting the world from devastation
04?
04LOL
/me hides
TEAM ROCKET HURR DURR
...lol us as Team Rocket
...LOL MENTAL IMAGES
me as some form of Jessie
you as some form of James
and Xeli as an espeon instead of meowth
that would be Epic
04awesome
04anyway
04back to the topic
"Drake!"
"Espeon, that's right!"
oh man x-X
06o3o
06either way
06From what Drake said it sounded like I'm some kind of solid snake/demoman lovechild or something
06Espeon, dat's right
06A clear improvement
welll I need to brb
woah Xeli, lag
04XD
04demomand lovechild.
lololol
04demoman*
04brings to mind
04a video I saw.
04mymind
04itburnsfromthememories
x_________x
butt hurr
.
but*
we have some things fingered out!
...
finger
04...
finguer
04hahaha
figured*
04ahahahahahahahhaa
fuck
shut up you >:(
XD
04that typo
04was the most epic typo ever
x_X
06But it's rather amuwhat
I type it too much
06that's up there with bumphump
XD
04XD
04Anyway.
04Xeli could be the weapon specialist.
04or something.
04I always saw you as the muscle of the group.
06hahaha oh what
...lol
06but for the sake of the story sure
Xeli like chuck norris
ohgodmymind
06nope
04XD
or well
I accidentally brought up
the reminiscence openoffice window
and then though
thought*
"Xeli as The Hensh"
OFU
04LOL
06Not sure if want
even worse
if Drake was The Hensh
04...
then it'd be Seran x The Hensh
04ohgod
as it's technically Drake x me here
and then...
04mymind
>mindfuck
xD
ohnofuckiblewuptheinternet
...lol
I read that as "oh no fuckible up the internet"
04XD
my mind
is obviously in a state of distress
anyway
I should go
will be back around 10:30pm - 11:pm
00
11:00pm
04I won't be here
06And now I will never look at team rocket the same way again
06And D:
rofl Xeli
04XD
oh god
/me hugs NS
another image
04I'll have to see you tomorrow.
The Hensh/Kommander Kulesz as Jessie/James
mind = blown
/me hugs Drake back
yeah see you tomorrow too then
bbl now
06Then it was just Drakespeon left
04XD
04so yeah
04You're fine with Leonard Anderson?
06Well both that and I have no idea what I would come up with otherwise
04Fair enough then XD
04So I have the names in a safe place where I will never forget them.
06Lol

or better yet, start my car and plug my main comp into that
What if I cut all the wires in your house and stabbed your phone, netbook, and computer?
hmm, then you would be dead before you got to the end of my driveway
/me cocks his .22 rifle
lol
I already stabbed everything
and I ate your car
again, dead before you got to the end of my driveway. I would then skin you and wear your flesh to assume your identity and weave myself into your former life
yay!
Let the cleaning begin!

of course cat. :)
oh :D
i lead the vamps, with jay as my 2nd
cat leads music.
hmm, but can Zombies even be led?
lol, ur the zombie expert. can they?
Yes!
not really. Psuedo Zombies, yes, but not true zombies
idk, u cud lead them to places with boomer bile.
lol
depends on what kind of zombies they are I guess
/me nods
you could lead most zombies with a hunk of meat on a stick
yes, but those are Psuedo zombies, the infected in L4D
oh.
hmm, but would they be following the meat, or would they be following you?
RUN, its not the meat they're after!
lolol
and I am not sure they would go after dead meat. in many zombie movies, whenever you see the survivors in a grocery store, aside from the general looted nature of the place, the meats do not look like they were picked over by the undead
hallo!
eyo
well, at least if zombies ever did take over, no one would starve.
so who will lead the werewolves? shapeshifter? werecats?
magicians?
i must apologize, been reading too much fiction as of late... :)
elves? dwarves? dragons?
ah but the list seems endless.
and i love it!
:D

03OK so bottom line
Hmm?
03Even when you use DD-WRT, D-Link is a POS
03right? XD
pretty much
0369.47.64.220 <- that's what my IP *should* be
03oh wait
03maybe it changed
03since I called the ISP last night and made my speed faster XD
rofl
well drf
go to cmd and do ipconfig /all
or check your router for your IP
03IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.146.1(Preferred) <- WTF????
03192.168.146?!
03It should be .1...
that's the local
03read what I said
03it should be 192.168.1.1
ah
hahah

03and ipconfig says 192.168.146.1`
03which makes no sense to me
you mean thursday
window's ipconfig command is less complicated
than linux's ifconfig command
which essentially serve the same purpose
remember timezones :P

04this is peeving me
04an attempted .sbnk replace went "LOL SCREW YOU"
04I have no clue as to why
03hm
03I hope queueing up a download in iTunes won't screw up Xbox Live :/
03if it does I guess I can always just come back up here and pause it
/me has Digital Copy¬Æ codes for Harry Potter movies 2-6 now
03Target was all sold out of 1, I'll go back later
12blah drf D:
12i want to find a gameboy emulator that will let me assign keys for autofire and speed up the game as well
03what
03LOL
lol
I think it does that
12VGA has autofire
12but it doesn't let you set which keys to autofire
03heh
Hmm..oh well
03Lameboy for DS does :P
12that can't play gameboy roms though could it?
03yes it does
03it's for flash cards
12i see o-O

/me kills self
Hi guys.
It's the echidna again.
Woah
03been a while since I used this
o-o
03NOW I'm a basement dweller :P
o-o
KNUCKLES?
12sigh
12every emulator i come across only has autofire for A and B
12why does no on see a need to set autofire for the direction arrows
12*one
03why would you ?
12i want to force my character to run for eternity into a repeating pattern so i can level up a pokemon in the day care
12i cant seem to well you know
12find any gameshark cheats that work for the game, i guess for some reason since it's from a different region the english gameshark codes don't work
03of course they don't, the codes are country-specific
03as for the pattern, you don't just need autofire then, you need a macro
03I got a solution for you though
03use the on-screen keyboard and Autoclicker
03have it click on the arrow keys
03in whatever pattern you want
03:P
12but i want to do other things while it's working
12i have already considered that path drf
03yeah i don't think that's gonna be possible then
03anyway bbl
when I was looking for info about the wiring I actually found someone posted on the Michigan Radio Buzzboard with a picture of the same setup I have
12meow
Hi
No. TTE.
ANYWAY is Mr. In Charge around?
no
Damn.
Next time you see him, tell him to add/turn on the extension...
...
wait a damn second, there are no extensions AT ALL installed on this thing!
o-o
oh lawd
That needs to be fixed!
o...o
Goodnight all
bye
then do something my child
o_O
12my friend asked me to go on pokesav
12and hack him a double battle team for him
o_O
lolwut
12he asked me to make a volcarona for him with rage powder and i couldn't find it on the list
12on the attack list
12it's a primative pokesav, the pokemon aren't fully translated yet
12nor are the attacks and abilities and such
12so i'm trying to find rage powder can't find it, check bulbapedia to see what the japanese translation of the attack was, it says rage powder
12finally i decide to just go down the list to find the attack, looking up whatever i wasn't familiar with
12finally i found it -.-
12anger powder
12what a troll
ah
lmao
12i wish i can go into pokesav
12and change all the pokemon names back to their english names
12like find the source or something
ah
12you're not familiar with pokesav?
nope
remember I'm not really interested in pokemon?
12coming from the person who admins a pokemon community
I lack access.
Don't we all my friend?We need more access in life
stop finding loopholes
XD
12:P
well
12it's what i do best though
I have lost interest in pokemon
12i'm surprised i'm not trying to be a lawyer
and I admit I admin this community not really because of pokemon
but because of the community
I have a lot of friends here
heh
you should
12nah
12lawyers are demonized too much
12and your paycheck lays heavily on competition

holy crap

if you see their connect notices, sure, ban their host for >3 months
okay
Pity I don't have my network bot and proxy checker services running here, or they would have been gone soon after they started
BOPM?
I could set one up
BOPM and the botnet monitor/killer I made
what is going on here?! why are those bot spamming>?
oops forgot to add the date
enough

03just had to pause a download as my connection was lagging
03anyway bbl again

07that'll quiet things down lol
o-o?
Kyu, that mode is to recdirect bots to another channel
07i know
you removed it ;p
07but I got rid of my ircop
you could just /umode2 -so
Ah, so you could join
I see
sec
come on BOPM
join
07and the stream of bots joining was kinda annoying since I dunno what to do about it =P
Alright, running script now
hope everyone is joined to at least one channel
uh
What's happening?
someone is attacking
This server?
stupid thing
the bots all pinged out
weird
well I'll leave it on for a bit
Pity, they all went away before I was about to mass join them

hi
hiya
iduno
his IP was a tor node too
CHECK -> Checking '245.255.103.97' for open proxies on all scanners
or not
I forgot BOPM fails
at doing that
it needs some configuration
CHECK -> All tests on 245.255.103.97 completed.
an open port to tell the proxies to try connect to, in order to see if they are open or not
[15:59:33] <+AmbernovaBOPM> CHECK -> DNSBL -> 97.103.255.245 appears in BL zone rbl.efnet.org (TOR exit server)
3.12 doesn't really
Hrmm...
in that case it can't check for new open proxies/etc which don't appear on lusts
lists*
and won't be as good
hrmmm
Can't seem to PM him.
Ah
I just left the default configuration
for the proxy scanner section
fyi
Ah
blah
freebsd
lol
I'll keep that on
did I accidentally unset that?
ah okay
04ok
I unset it in hopes the bots would come and I could quickly dispatch them
04hi everyone
hi
looks like they didn't
I should deoper now lol
I'll leave BOPM on for now
bopm will be informative only for now until it's configured ;p
and won't take much action
it doesn't scan properly
using the scan command that is
I'll be online throughout the day while at work, so will try to help if they come back
leaving in ~5-10 mins
okay cool
hopefully they don't come back x-X
that +f should handle things a little in the meantime
15 sec interval, +C when >5 ctcp, +R when >5 joins, +K when >2 knocks, +N when >4 nickchanges, +M when > 20 messages total, kick when >7 lines individual
+j 3:10, single person can't join more than 3 times in 10 seconds,
could restrict it a little more and possibly still not affect any legitimate users though
04so
04what's going on?
bot talk, and rawr
+f will not do to well however if the bots mass register
12!cynder
I should bring a copy of my network bot here, it monitors all the services stuff too and reverses mass registrations
x_X
well
and builds a database of known users, and knows when a botnet is connecting, and a normal users
it doesn't look like they knew how to
because if they did, they would have registered and joined the channel
do you have services logchan enabled?
I don't monitor services here
Ah okay
04have there been bot attacks or something?
yeah
added you as admin, as you are one of the few who knows what to do here ;p
try enable logchan and check #services
uh...I normally don't oper up xD
sec
wait...how the hell did you add me as an admin and allow me access to set?
and not restart services?
/me waves claws around mysteriously
XD
modded version of services that allows SAs access to set or something? XD
yeah admin doesn't usually have access to /os set
only SRA does...at least in 1.8.x
Look at that baka.
12i take it your favorite movie is "I AM LEGEND"
o_O
TTEchidna wanted to talk to you about something.
alright
Ah yes.
OKAY SO
THAT WIKI
what about it
It lacks wondrous extensions which can make it prettyfied.
Like if statements.
One sec ill install parser functions.
also I still want your SFA site.
The old Spyro Fans Anonymous?
yes.
:P
Man, I don't even know if it's still active or if they recycled it.
And I lack the password as well as access to that.
Because I've changed my email a couple times since 2004.
http://spyro.conforums3.com/
its still alive
Unbelievable.
figure it out and get me some access if you can :)
But why? Last post there's by replica handbags,
Which I don't believe is an ironic username.
I want to incorporate it into spyroforum
it still gets traffic that Iam interested in.
Isn't SpyroForum just the successor site to it?
...SFA gets traffic?
Well, it's doubtful any redirects can be made, since Conforums owns it...
Dont worry about technical details, I can take care of that
just try to get me access :)
And I'm not Hunter, so the password on my account on Conforums isn't 22475.
The username's the default "admin" though.
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Hrm.
Can't think of what I used there.
Hi egg dear.
Hello.
TTEchidna, try to use expressions now.
and tellme if it works.
hello Darkeiya
http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Skelos_Badlands
You tell me if it's working. Because it looks perfect to me!
works fine I assume?
Ooh, you got the switch statements working!
Yep
Though I feel corrupted. My first impression upon it now is "needs more roundycorners". orz
Just installed the extension for you guys/.
Awesome. :D
haha
hey, I just noticed
its rare to find a wiki that doesnt ask for money these days :P
Ah don't worry.
Once we're finished with it, this thing's gonna need eighteen servers to keep it from crashing.
Pfffff.
Id put some ads up if we go major traffic
Let's not get too ambitious now, hon. Spyro may have a large fanbase, but it'll never be on the same caliber as larger franchises like Pokemon.
Not a threat. A serious speculation. Last wiki I made pretty went from one to eight servers in four years.
Darkeiya, do I know you from anywhere?
SFA, of couuuuurse.
You might. I tend to use the same name everywhere.
I'm getting the old team back together. We're gonna make the lone independent Spyro wiki AWESOME.
I was one of the original administrators at Spyro Fans Anonymous.
07nyan
Anyways, its great you guys are working on the wiki.
its got a good article base already, more is always good though.
Good article base...
*looks at Sor's page*
Well.
Better than nothing?
Well, I thought it was good :P
heya Kyu
The fact that it exists is good.
07ohai
spyropedia only gets about 35-45 unique hits a day as it is.
However everything could do with a powerup.
Now, why have I skulked back into the Spyro fandom?
are you going to clear the voices or something? XD
not sure if you have access
07nope
ONE: SKYLANDERS. Now, why that? I hate it! AND THAT IS WHY.
do it manually then? XD
Oh also, heh.. http://www.spyropedia.ru/
07nah :3
There's a Russian Spyro wiki.
Looks like we got a russian sister site :P
well then
Ooh.
I havent done anything with the spyro fandom in like the last year or so.
I CANNOT READ IT
After Pok√©mon... I cannot be fazed by any other fandom.
Hm. Judging from their links, they've also found German and... Finnish sister sites too?
At least the wars between classic and legend Spyro fans can end because of Skylanders.
Eh, disregard that last bit. Seems to be wikias.
I dont even know what skylanders is.
inb4 massive ranting tirade
You sir... are lucky.
HEY HON, BEFORE YOU START BITCHING, MIND UPLOADING THE OTHER TALISMAN IMAGES? :3
BUT it is important TTEchidna that you make an effort to try to get the SFA details for me :)
...yes I do.
If I remember them, I'll do so.
What SFA details?
Apparently it still gets traffic.
What, those old forums?
For real?
!fight Kyu
/me uses Headbutt on Kyu! It's a critical hit! Kyu loses 347 HP! Kyu has 1328 HP left!
!fight Umbreon
/me idles
/me uses Water Pulse on Umbreon! It's a critical hit! Umbreon loses 217 HP! Umbreon has 1146 HP left!
Google traffic is good traffic.
thats what you get.
12nooooo
Hmm.
I also am not impressed that spyropedia isnt #1 on google for the "spyro wiki" search
Well, it'll likely be nothing once Spyropedia... is souped up.
D:
Spyropedia just needs to get souped up.
Also that logo is ugly but that's a given thanks to Legend 1 Spyro.
It needs backlinks
once people link to it from other websites our rank will increase.
07can't
07o3o
I'll negotiate with NIWA after we soup it up... I know you already link with WikiBound...
I didnt really work on a logo i just used the old one from spyroworld.
Hm.
TTEchidna, you wanna write news for spyroworld?
its been kind of dead.
Considering all news is... Skylanders news...
*grumble*
news is news.
Speaking of news, funny fact.
Because my idiot brother gave away my YotD game, I had to buy a new one.
I also just noticed that darkspyro has like over a million posts now
And since I bought this new disc, it makes YotD the most recent Spyro game I've bought.
Not AHT, not SSL...
YotD. As it should be.
12!fight kyu
/me uses Leech Seed on kyu! kyu gains 308 HP! kyu has 1636 HP left!
wait a minute, he must have done some major forum cleaning
12yeah because using the attack on you heals you
hes down to 3500 members
and 600k posts
Hmm.
Hm.
I offered to buy darkspyro one day you know.
Sounds like a Serebii/Bulbagarden war.
Meh Im not into the spyro fandom like I once was
if I was in it now id be even more ruthless :P
Just kidding.
Hmm.
As for remaining talismans...
HERE
WE
GO
\o/
I'm gonna try and soup up the Talisman article.
If you guys need anything else, shoot me an email or just say my nickname on here and it alerts me.
Though then that leaves the talisman pages to be deleted afterwards... hm.
Alrigh.
It really makes me feel weird to say this...
But the best thing to do?
GIFF ADIMZ POWAH PLZ
I think you might need to poke him with the name.
And speak more legibly.
dingding
*poke*
hey
What would make wiki working easier would be if... well, there were admins around.
*volunteer*

dont admin anyone else
or mess my stuff up.

04How do you think it should begin?
04Should we already know each other, or should we be strangers until we're put togther as a team?
strangers
04K
04But I guess we'd all write our own chapters from our own perspectives.
night all
derp
03:<
but we still have to have control of the other characters, Drake
Are we doing it in first-person or third-person?
04obviously
I prefer third-person
04Your choice.
04I prefer thi-
04Yeah
12or at least drf will
HIVEMIND
03XD
I tend to write like

Xion's Story-way in first person
don't like it
03I think I barely passed physics... but at the point where it's not actually going to help my GPA...
makes me sound like a retarded grandma or something

12:<
03well anyway
03I'm gonna go to bed too
o-o
04So
04I'm going to start out in Aus, because that's where I actually am.
04Are you also going to start out in Aus or do you want to live in Antarctica?
/me shot
I'll start with the later, Drake ;)
nah, I'll be in australia
actually
how about we know each other from school or something

04Sure
well yeah, school or something
and then we get there
and we're like
04Do you want us to be friends or not know each other much?

friends

a random person
who we're thrown together with

04sure
uh
chapter summaries*
04write your summery.
summery
XD
04Actually.
04I'd rather sort out the characters first.
04We need the supreme executive chairman of the mercenary company first.
04Then our summaries.
04Then maybe some extra teammates.
bloody hell
why is compiling on windows
or Drake's for that matter
I mean
that aside
and hm
chairman
somehow I see Shiny as that
04XD
we can make him Karl
or just use his character
04We don't need everyone from this IRC in the story you know
04Although I'd rather have Karl as a teammate.

Oh, what dark days are these where men can say "Ni" to old women and get away with it?
14night everyone
Lol. There were a couple of people that SR was actually nice to yesterday.
One asked for admin, and he gave it immediately (on the wiki).
And he actually used smiley faces a lot.
It was...Strange.
Well, you know what they say. Everyone cracks a smile once in a while, even if it's just due to relieved gas.
Lol.
Seems he knows them from somewhere called "Spyro Fans Anonymous" from a long time ago.
Oh, it's a little reunion.
How cute.
No one else has been on for the last couple of days?
Unfortunately. :/
Hm, I wonder why.
Asdf
:3
I was wondering if you know more about Nintendo DS sound files
Because VGMTrans is not extracting some of the sound effects properly
Apparently it doesn't support modulation or something
Nope -_-
It's a pita
>.>
>>
I don't think sseq2midi does
It might, idk
Try it out I guess o.o
I'm not sure how to extract the sseq files from the sdat though
Unless you say sseq2mid extracts them straight from the sdat
lol
Now its my birthday where I am
Eh...

i'm not going to respond to any PMs

12ign did a voting survey thing to determine the top 100 pokemon
12and Quilava managed to make it in :)
but that's 1/6 of them :|
12so?
12they are being trolls and only posting like 20 ranks a day
oh. lol.
12so i'm still waiting and/or hoping that umbreon manages to get in
it will. trust me :|
so will every single other eevee
yeah
really. hm.
12so yeah i got the order right
umbreon is probably up near the top :|
12if it made it in
lol
I wanna know the least voted few :P
12i know in the comments of the face off there was talk about trying to do it
so uh, whats up?
12not much
12just beat the elite four and lance in pokemon vietnamese crystal
12so hard to beat them when you can barely read what you are doing
12you?
03that fucking sucked.

/me eeps and noses
03D:
03bye ;;
03sigh
How are yous?
03so i got a new router
03I finally got it to work with my Xbox 360
Ah drf
03I had to DMZ it for it to stop whining about it not being open NAT
Up for that game of reach anytime soon? :P
12lol
03nah
03gonna play Portal 2
Pfft
XD
12i've been playing too much vietnamese crystal
03but the really odd thing is
03my mom's desktop, which is plugged in with ethernet, hates this new Netgear router
03and I can't for the life of me figure out why
It hates you'
03Like, the actual ethernet port
03on the motherboard
03despite hte green lights being on the router's "1" light being on meaning there's a solid connection...
12hmm
12ghosttttt
Which Model DRF?
03Um
03it ends in 3500
03it's a rangemax wireless N
One sec
I had a similar problem
03hm
03OK
Checking my netgear model now
/me starts up a new portal 2 game
03I had to use my laptop to flash it to dd-wrt, as my mom's desktop was being dumb, and still is
/me flops
03LOL WTF
Netgear DGN3500
03Router Model
03Netgear WNR3500v2/U/L
03that's what I have
LOOK AT MY LITTLE PONY
IT'S AMAZING
GIVE IT A LICK
(it tastes just like raisins)
Mine is this Netgear N300 WIRELESS GIGABIT ADSL2+ MODEM ROUTER
BY A STROKE OF ITS MANE IT TURNS INTO A NACHO
Or the DGN3500 XD
03yeah mine is that without the ADSL modem
THEN IT TURNS GAY
THEN IT TURNS INTO SPAIN
03since... well, we have cable
03but anyway how did you fix it?
http://www.netgear.co.uk/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/DGN3500.aspx
THEN IT TURNS BACK INTO PINKIE
(ooh that's dirty)
I didn't
03o.o
I just restarted my comp and router
03LOL WTF
Everything was fine after that
If that doesn't fix it, it's something to do with the Modem not supporting the Router
12hmm]
03well see, it works perfectly fine with wi-fi
03it's just the Ethernet that's not working, and ONLY my mom's computer
Hmm
Might be the port on the computer itself
03well
03it works if I plug the modem straight into the computer
03just not through the router
Hmm
How many ethernet ports does the router have?
034
03yes I tried all of them
/me nibbles Umbreon
/me licks
Right ok, what speed can the PC's E-port handle?
03...
03you know, that's a good point
03the router is gigabit, and the computer is probably only 10/100
03that would do it, eh? LOL
XD
I have a 500MBPs ethernet card in my PC and that works fine
how is?
03LOL
03I wish I could find some way to make it work though...
12a little tired
12and today i have to go to the college to get fillings done
Well if it's a the new Netgear model, a 100MBPs E-card won't run it (not without difficulty anyway)
I had to fork out ¬£50 to get a new Ethernet Card
03:/'
ahh.
ohai.
Though strangely
12hi fellow eeveelution
The New Netgear models screw up a lot with Xbox Live >>

!mateplz
o-o
!mateplz
12then again they didn't do anything besides x-rays and charting out my teeth
13Other than when they use needles to numb your mouth, I personally don't see why people find going to the dentist so terrifying o-o
12have an appointment back with them for restoration
Charting O.o
I hate needles x.x
12yeah mapping out which teeth need fillings
Oh
FIlling is blahx xl,
*blah
13I also don't understand why people say their fillings are painful
12i need like 11-12 fillings
13I've had a filling before and I felt no pain at all
13o-o
12the first thing people with fillings do is chew on tin foil for about an hour
12most people
AE~! :3
the Drill is painfull x.x
youre just immune to pain X3
13Drills aren't painful, just a bit uncomfortable :B
12you sure you weren't sedated
12?
13I'm positive :B
12AE :D
13The only time I've ever had anything to numb pain was when I had a tooth taken out last year
12you're top 100 pokemon
12http://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/53
/me steals AE's power to block pain.

13I'm not even all that good at tolerating pain, I just simply didn't find it painful at all xD
13:<
;o

/me slaps Umby
/me listens to friday

13I know what IS painful though

13But I'm way past the days of having braces now, thankfully xD

12Hello :>
heya WhiteTail
12O_O
....
12How are you Umbreon? ^^
12i'm fine
12besides the fact i need dental work done
ouch, what happend?
12i have like 11-12 cavities
12XD
12OvO;
thats...alot
12Doesn't that hurt like hell?
12no not at all o-o
i've only got like...2, but 11-12?
12every once in awhile i'll feel some slight sensitivity but otherwords no pain
get to it very fast, if you are too late with getting it drilled and so, it's gonna hurt, badly
12i'm supposed to go back in june to get fillings
i think i just shut up then, i'm eating chocolate ;3
12i hate sweets
what flavour?
12i guess you'd never guess that with the cavities XD
12i used to drink soda A LOT
0611-12 cavities o_O
no, when i just got 2 new fillings, i went to have some D√∂ner
right away, when my cheeck was still paralyzed
12lol
and with flavour i mean, like how the sweets taste
12anything with sugar
12well a considerable amount of sugar
lol
12i love spicy food more
12if it doesn't make you cry, it's not hot enough
/me offers Umbreon some hot chilli suace
12nomnomnom
12sometimes it gets hard to find something hot enough though
i like ketjap manis more than sambal roedjak, that is really spicy, but still somewhat sweet

7Yay, AE!
7Want that Deino? :3
What did you do?
long story short: I will be belittled, insulted, and likely fired
true...
2Qunay, i tried getting the shiny dream vulpix but that dumb "have dream pokemon" code didn't work =< sowwy
13Sure :3 What do you want in return?
What did you do?

I'll figure that out later, trying to tunnel VNC atm

why didnt you call?
feels bad man :(
03this one was only like $200 for everything
03which is really cheap eh?
7Try checking, Chao.
03considering it's like, actually decent
what coast do you live on again
Say you were not capable of using the phone at the time and sue them
the reason for this was I had grown comfortable with the predictability of my schedule that I did not look at it for this week, assuming I worked all days but Monday and tuesday
13I have White ^^;
east
I worked all days but monday and wednesday
oh
4 more hours brah
2the activation worked (hold select and check the Wii) but all i get is Shiny Genesect
up here in the
arson state
Say you were not capable of using the phone at the time and sue them
you have three guesses as to which one that is
and the other 2 no call no shows were pretty much the same circumstances, but a few years back
7AE?
7Darn, lag.
is it north east?
...
well thats stupic
stupid
7Okay, well:
They shouldnt be able to fire you because if it
7Hmm...
Say your phone line was not working
7Do you have a Ditto?
under the contract I signed, put together with the approval of my Union, they can
7Or better yet, a Tynamo.
Say your phone line was not working
and you were sick
2who? me of AE
7AE.
perhaps
they know better...
7I need to breed Tynamos for that pokemon competition. >>

oh, I have a few parting shots lined up

13I have a Ditto, but I tend to use him for breeding since he happens to be modest-natured |D
2unless you wanna Bad EGG

13I could catch one for you if ya want though o3o

ohai
13that's my code if you don't have it yet :3
10lol
2my action replay has no micro sd slot!!! i'll have to add that long code manually................
10now my dad's computer has that Windows XP Internet Security crap on it
Not even the cable and software o.o
7I have it, AE.
7Couldn't connect, though. X.x
2how can i add codes, without manually?
2the dream ability code is way too long
13o-o That's weird, I saw you on wifi so I thought you'd be able to see me too
10he tried to blame me for it >_>
10like I ever use his computer
crap I don't even know if I recieved it HML
Lawls
7I dunno, Chao. D:
7If you could hack an ability directly onto a pokemon, that's an alternative.
2doubt it
2i don't think you can get a shiny pokemon in dream world
7But you can transfer Dream abilities by breeding.
7So you can breed for that. o3o
2what about the shinyness?
13You can transfer dream abilities by breeding?
13o-o
7Yes.
2yes
2aw, Quany beat me
13do you need two DW Pokemon for that or just one?
2one
2mother must have dream ability

12yay i caught raikou
Well, for the lol... I'm now getting yet another teletype.
Why?
Who knows. But it'll be awesome.
speaking of oddities
look what I ended up with

o-o what happened to your greet message Sneas
:–∑ / :–ó / :3 / :¬≥ / —î: / E: / :–≠ / –Ñ: / :—ç
X3
there we go
XD
Nice.
Not as awesome as an ASR-33 though. :P
perhaps
but my interests lean toward that
You know, if you broadcast an hourly, or bi-hourly RTTY news bulletin you might get more listeners (who are HAMs). :P
you are forgetting a big factor
POWER LIMITS
I can't run more than 100 mW or I will be in big trouble
slapped with a fine of several thousand dollars
So? A RTTY news bulletin won't need you to run high power. :P
actually you do
Plus, it'll give your transmitter a nice excercise.
for any respectable coverage
(By running at full power...)
not so
even with processing the most you can get with 100 mW is four miles
4 miles is enough for local news.
not really
only one or two others near me are amateur radio operators
not much potential
narrowcasting does not make much sense with that kind of range
True enough.
Well, I'ma head out, as it's getting late, and I have stuff to do early tomorrow.
o-o
(I am also NOT going to watch the royal wedding.)
o...o

Some fans of Dramatica wondered if this was an elaborate troll or an April Fool‚Äôs joke; visiting Dramatica‚Äôs old IP address, 208.99.87.133, gave a message that was interpreted by some to mean that Dramatica was only temporarily offline. But the redirect is permanent, Encyclopedia Dramatica founder and current OhInternet primary contributor Sherrod DeGrippo told me by email, and OhInternet is here to stay.
wat
The founder decided it was time for a change.
._______.
04I don't know if he's 'shaping up' or if it's a big 'take that' to the internet.
that's retarded though
why would he do that, owning a site as big and popular as ED?
04'Cause his parents found out.
/me hides
lmao
‚Äúa more toned down content style and a streamlined design: Shock for shock‚Äôs sake is old at this point and we‚Äôre looking forward to the future and how things are evolving ‚Ä¶ when you put user experience first, the language becomes highly important and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done.‚Äù
I supppose he thinks the site will die if he doesn't make changes.
04wat
04It's ED
04WHY THE HELL IS IT 'TONED DOWN'?
He might be right - I don't know his viewing statistics.
04yeah well
04I'm gonna draw noe

I'm not trolling Umbreon xD
06what
12i didn't say you were
12gu
12hi
;o
!espeon
ooooh nice
the newest version of ZNC has some cool stuff
3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
don't want to recompile the servers though ><
!espeon
because then it means downtime
and the newer versions aren't compiling on windows x_X
04o-o
04wait 'till the NEXT version of ZNC then
04Maybe then it might be worth recompiling the servers.
probably
I could probably write some modules and add them to the servers instead of having to take them down and recompile
if there's a security update then I'll recompile
anyway bbl
06~
hm
04k
06I think it's about time for me to post in the rp thing as well o3o
doesn't work
;(
04well the 'battle' finished so I guess it's a good time
hm okay
well that's good at least
06Just stop, don't give people ideas. I don't want to perma-ignore anyone because they try to be funny =P
derp
._.
okay
also derp
I'll post when I get back
06And yes Drake, that's what I thought
04k
I deliberately ended the battle lamely like that
because it was going on for too ong

06Volteon is pretty fun though
12not enough tail
06xD
06Tails are very important, that's true
06Ninetails
06ign y u do dis
04It stops at 20 or so
04I am disappointed.
12lol
12Drake
12they have been revealing 20 ranks at a time every day
04oh
12the 25th there was only ranks 100 through 81
06I'm rather curious what #1 will be now
12i swear....
06if it's mudkip or something then it will just be too predictable
06LOL
06xD
04XD
12well lucario and umbreon are my top favorites
12so D:
12i'm all out of stuff i want to make it to the top
04I bet they'll get lazy and just choose Pikachu
06lol
12pikachu is already in the top 100
06Isn't that the result of that thing where users clicked their fave of two Pokemon or something?
12that wasn't how they did the process
06or is this "editors pick"
12yeah it was a whole bunch of voting
06Ah yeah
06then I'm surprised Lucario isn't higher for
12http://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/48
06reasons
06.-.
12and gyarados
04ok
04So far, I have two characters in DU, with two awaiting approval.
04I make way too many characters o-o
12i badly wanted all the eeveelutions to make it
12but i doubt leafeon is going to top everyone else
04Yeah
/me licks Umbreon
04Leafeon was never particularly popular.
/me eeps
12Drake tcg it was very popular
12leafeon lv. x was like a 50 dollar card for awhile
12XD
04H-uh
12still is rather expensive as well
04But it's not exactly memorable.
12lol
04When you think of the eeveelutions, it's very rarely the first one that comes to mind.
12considering i have a gigantic leafeon poster on my wall
12it's hard not to think of it
04XD
06When I think of them Leafeon is in fact one of the first that comes to mind o.O
12we're missing the most important one of all as well
12eevee has yet to make it
04odd
12eevee and leafeon are the two that havn't appeared
12all the other eeveelutions are in lol
06o.o now I must go through the list just to see the comments to all :3
06And Eevee needs love too
12lol
12flareon is awfully low on the list
12i guess all that fluff wasn't fluffy enough
lmao
the "royal" wedding
is boring as fuck
hell, my ass is more interesting
06the lack of moves couldn't be ignored
flareon would be nicer if it could use flare blitz
06>sweet fire moves
06HAHAHAHA THIS IGN PERSON MUST BE CRAZY
06But I still

/me afks again
12i havn't seen a bad comment yet
12except pikachu
06xD
06All the Eeveelution comment things involve the word "cute"
06okay.jpg
LOL 12 years old "BAWWWWWW" much about ED. They should get over it and go outside.
06or they could just go to encyclopediadramatica.ch and continue rotting?
06But people act like anything of value was "lost"~
/me balances a cookie ontop of Umbreon's head
/me slides it off and watches it crumble to pieces against the ground upon impact
12this cookie needs medical attention D:
/me sweeps the cookie fragments into his jaws
Medical attention has been administered
12another life lost D:
/me ponders balancing another cookie on Umbreons head, but instead empties the jar of cookies over Umbreon instead
/me faints

oh look, another black floofball
/me gasps and flails "hey! oww!"
06And I seriously think the people who translated that must have been either high or just been using google translate
12XD
i g2g shortly :<
12i dunno
12i wish i knew the vietnamese name for umbreon
06Doesn't it say on that picture? =P

/me eeps and retracks his wing, before petting
12i wish articuno could be caught in crystal
12that would make a fun sig placing a mistranslated articuno pokedex entry with a lugia pokedex entry
12so far i think my favorite pokedex entry is either pidgeot or ditto XD
Hey.
12Pidgeot = ?CAN SEE A COIN FROM 1000M BY CUTE EYE-SIGHT.
Hi
lol
13LOL
Where'd everyone go?
12Ditto = ?WHEN MET, IT WILL ACT MORE VIOLENTLY.
hehehe
lawl
Meh,
12i love this youtube series XDD
wich one?
06Lol
12these people play the pokemon vietnamese crystal
12they haven't uploaded in awhile because of something stalling them so i downloaded the ROM myself and started playing
12i already beat red XD
12the first translation i think they got right.
Also - did you see me say this? I found a brony on ponychan that said Kekekekeke.
12i was hoping for his text box to have a bunch of questionmarks in it or some random letters
Oh haha
We should ask him next time he's on here
:P
Lol. Somehow I'm thinking not.
He'll probably just get mad and leave though
06LOL
I thought he didn't care what people thought of him, so he shouldn't care that we think he's a brony? :P
13Aren't they doing Pokemon Green bootleg right now? o3o
12yeah
12they are doing both
12i went ahead and tried green as well
13then again, I haven't finished watching the latest vietnamese crystal parts yet |D
12got all the eeveelutions for that game as well XD
lol, true
12those guys are probably going to go mad at red
Also, pony drinking game: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/g/src/130374605052.jpg
Lol.
12and of course red has a snorlax that is pretty much impossible to one shot kill

Hiya.
12How goes?
okay enough i guess
I may restart my computer soon because this annoying graphical bug is happening again
12oh, lol
12I have to restart my computer a lot as well
12I think we all do XD
try logout or killing explorer
02Killing explorer, the true test of "knowing what are you doing"
02also an effective way to kill lag

Heya DRF
/me is back, even though she never mentioned leaving
02Wb(?)
13Why do we have such crappy rubber gloves, I've had to replace them at least 3 times over the past couple of weeks because they somehow keep getting holes in them when I'm washing the dishes
13What's the point in using rubber gloves that break easily? Might as well not use them at all >:/
13rant rant rant
13xD
;p
Silly english glovs
ooh
/me is trying to get an Adamant Cyndaquil
12Hello Nick ^^
02argh, another rash nature ;_;
02SUCCESS~
02Adamant, Heck yes
02now to check IVs
I am back, and still have a job :D
ALTAIR!
:3
/me tackle huggles
Hey~
/me hugs back
02FUUUUUU.. HP IV ;_;
02Now I wonder if I should get another one :\
:D
Did you get punished?
write up, but those go away after a month
:D
:D and my desired upgrade is 100% compatible with my current computer

hay Nick
13Ray
/me huggles
13breed your Cyndaquil with a Ditto whilst it's holding an everstone
13the offspring are much more likely to have adamant nature if you do that :P
13so if you want to go for good IVs, I'd recommend doing that
13so you don't have to worry too much about getting the right nature all over again :B
02hmm..
/me is hugged oo
02sadly, I'm on a flashcard. and The original .sav isn't that far + I have a meganium on the Original
02So I'm doomed to talk to prof elm.. again, and again
02and again, and again
13D:
02for the rest of the ethernity
13In that case, good luck :3
02I'll need it ;_;
02brb
/me brbs
/me ish back
