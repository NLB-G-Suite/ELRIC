NO Applebloom!
Not onto the pit IT BUUUUUUUUURRRRRNSS
/me facedesks

Oh wait, Explosion
03You get the "new generation" of kids that are just starting to play

>_<
07since each gen sold less each time
11,01Gunthler: Looks clear for you.
03he was the one running around saying how BW sold more than any of the others
03>_>
:)
07D/P/P was the only gen to have a rise in sales from the previous gen
@Swagmeter The Cat

02not really fair to compare other games to those XD
07that's not unusual, the 90s sales trends favored japanese games over anything else
Metal git -3-
07that doesn't make it unfair
03why would it be unfair? Those were the first
03that's totally relevant LOL
03because if anything

Metapod use's harden... but it failed
Tell that to a soldier who's having his guts cut open
There is a fine line between too much alcohol and enjoying a drink. Alcohols have an interesting range of flavours that are hard to replicate outside. Also the base ethanol allows for the some really niffty tricks one can do with botanicals.

WOah long link
Ironic thing is that Communist governments USED capitalism
Ummmm
When you allow too much wealth to concentrate in too few hands, it distorts the economy.
0,14o_o
that... looked painful
Hmmm
It's not about "giving money to the lazy."
Didn't think it was that long....
Very much like us right now.
yeah
If there was no inherent greed in society pure capitalism would work but people exploit it thus causing a failure in the economy
All for one little picture....
And yet somehow it doesn't stimulate the economy.
:(
I'm sorry....
I think Kim Jong Ung is more interested in eating Cheeseburgers then spewing hate propaganda against the world :D

Communism was exploited after Stalin came in power

that's a COMMISION

do you have a rig?
/me destroys some Tyranids, LIKE A BAWS!
02I know
I very much hate competition
With a ton of controllers?
Well RD is at the bottom of my bf's favorites list o.o
Or are you doing rotating each bone individually
coww
which is a terrible idea might I add
I never could relate to tomboys either
Rarity is my favorite pony. :#
:3
lonley island is best pony
I'm still waiting on Fighting is magic.
why would I use a ton of controllers
(unless you're detailing subtle side-motions and etc)
0,14^
I'm literally in my first month of animating
Well I mean
eep!

meh.
Y u no let me stay up
02how much do you charge to do a commission? derp
03you got school toorrow?
03*tomorrow
I think the only thing that attracts me to Rainbow Dash is her curiosity in things that she doesn't have a grasp on. It shows her weakness and something she doesn't view as mere sport or competition
also, apparently NJ won in 2OT.
02say, for a 3 sec animation
03LOL
Nitt, that mean you're done?
Rainbow Dash used to be alot hight on my list... I don't know why she just keeps slipping though...
Night everyone, I'm going to go cry myself to sleep because I found out people have different opinions
Span
It just comes no matter how drowsy I am
slipping away
I don't do commissions
not right now
lol
brb
I don't
Later
