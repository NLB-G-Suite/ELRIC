The Animation to fit the line "love thy groom, in my heart there is no room" is amazing, and so realistic, possibly the best flash animation I've seen in a long time… The Camera moves from Cadence, and moves up to the ceiling with her silhouette on the ceiling, and rotates by 760 degrees and goes back down, to the mirror. Realistic Movement in flash to that scale is near impossible whilst keeping the "3D" look, and DHX Media do it perfectly,
the best flash animation I've seen in ages….
EVER4EVER4EVER4EVER4EVER
/me has a heart attack and is now DED
11,01I've actually never liked pigtails.

g4 Scoot is better scootaloo :3
I've been kicked twice in rapid succession two times now, it's bullshit.
Guys. Please calm down. You try to burn it with fire. The reason it doesn't burn is because ValtheJean is absorbing your fire and drawing dark nourishment from it. Starve him of your anger. It is the only way to win against this.
Now...Which one's cuter :P?
no compa
>.>
KIIIIIL MEEE!!
Thank god
Heya Spell-of-Gaming
Oh! Red Dwarf!

hello CowBuster007
This one was great.
03each one sold more than the previous because you have new people jumping on the bandwagon

i loved 3rd gen
but only because of secret bases
02^
XD
lol
03I never used those
03I was like, seriously, you need friends to use secret bases
these are the Japanese ratings I am going by

03and I'd rather they just quit while they're ahead LOL

Hope you bought your copy of GW2 already, the digital purchases are sold out in the US. xD
There is a fine line between too much alcohol and enjoying a drink. Alcohols have an interesting range of flavours that are hard to replicate outside. Also the base ethanol allows for the some really niffty tricks one can do with botanicals.
Or to a civilian with electrodes shoved up their ass.
Both end in death

11,01The gaming industry has more bullshit than a large farm now.
otakon: It's pretty simple, they set aside X codes, most of which went into the digital purchase and the rest went to places like Gamestop.
RaveBrony: I want to see a preview :|
I've never heard any corpses complain...
/me turns into a cup of water

Long story short Stallion_of_War, would you rather be burned alive or be shot in the head?
In either case it's not exactly a bad decision, since it's hard to do a beta if your servers don't work.

I have a lvl 73 Kingler on my Gold Save

if you are in a war... are you really sure someone keying your car is the first thing you SHOULD be worried about?
CupcakeWarrior: Naw. I just mentioned that GW2 has sold out of digital copies in the US, there's only a handful of Gamestop codes left apparently. So the US is almost sold out of codes for the beta.
man this celebration is no more than a holdback
what movie/show is this?
Stallion_of_War, are you even listening to yourself? Killing somepony is killing somepony, it doesn't matter who they are

It's not about "giving money to the lazy."
DocSane: like the US atm?
LunaTheBeloved, dat base64
Didn't think it was that long....
Very much like us right now.
yeah
If there was no inherent greed in society pure capitalism would work but people exploit it thus causing a failure in the economy
So we should go in and steal their money
and it's broken for me
All for one little picture....
We've been cutting taxes for decades. We have the lowest tax rate in 60 years.
So far the new North Korea leader looks retarded.... South Korea may have another bunch of decades of peace

Nittany_Discord: eeeyup
Barack Obama is Amabo Kcarab backwards
StinkomanFan: true i have to give it to you
Nittany_Discord: Greed helped the US progress for the last four decades at least. Although it does seem to be collapsing now.

He'd have done good only for the money involved
FIESTA!!
Yay ludicolo, get the maracas ~
is there any one streaming
That is greed is it not?
/me pulls out some morraccoa
OH YES
DocSane : Death is part of life. But I see your point. I hope the family of a cancer victim and charity will help him/her. But you can't force people to be generous , otherwise you're just some jerk dick who thinks he has the right to decide for others
11,01How has greed helped?
what?
*maracas
ohhhhhhh yaaaaaaaa
weebl?
Alister: There was a time when government didn't offer a social safety net and relied entirely on private charities.

For a seconnd I thought Discord...
11,01Military progress has helped.

Dark92Enigma: and THATS my view on the goal of life- make it so people miss you, not worry about yourself
hello everypony

Alister: And you take to help the less fortunate with the implicit promise that those services will be there for you if you ever need them.
Nittany-Discord: Companies exist to make money. They all want more and more. They want to grow, to get more. This is greed. And they grow.
:)
Nittany_Discord: and that is true but the colsd war there wasnt no fighting involve cause wouldnt have to do something with nucler war fare if they did
I have no clue
much better not alone
OH A PARTY
Just a note to everyone merengue is not meringue. Do not confuse them.

RoflBot: correction conflicts we havent declared war since WW2
11,01Wanting to make money is not greed.

What is Greed Nittany_discord?
ValtheJean, you must play this. http://youtu.be/0AHHOTDzWuM
AHA THE CUTE
NOW, can I NOT GET FUCKING KICKED EVERY FUCKING GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING MESSAGE I FUCKING ENTER THIS FUCKING TIME?
Ride my pony
D'aww so cute
this loops and loops
11,01Going too far in wanting to make money.
otakon: . . .
Nittany_Discord: no it is not wanting to make money is when you actually work for it not just be greedy
whoa otakon O_o
11,01Doing everything, even harm, to make money.
Nittany_Discord: But when do you have enough money? This lack of a definite "enough" is greed.
yeeeah WoodenToaster ftw
DocSane : People can create some healthcare between them If they want. Don't enforce your morals on everyone
Alister: Strength of moral character usually flies out the window when your family is facing a life or death situation.
/me kicked otakon for posting 1 message in 60 seconds
What does that mean Nittany_discord?
shut up woman get on my yoshi
@pokemon SlurryMoon
dude otakon is goin insane in mane chat anyone see that>
That doesn't mean anything
2,14 no otakon, but shouting like that in allcaps is the right direction to get kicked
Dark92Enigma: honestly, it would be such a big deal of people wouldnt ut his death above others.
ThePinkiePie: Alright... so your saying the Vietnam War was basically a gigantic hippie drum circle?
Nittany_Discord: And I think you'll find that a lot of companies do immoral things to make money.
Dark92Enigma: *wouldnt
Alister: Sorry, no.
ValtheJean: I was just kicke 5 times in a row.
People do various things that are harmful, money is just one of the many things
Nittany_Discord, by that definition than anything done solely for the money involved is greed
Nittany_Discord: im sorry to ask but is any one streaming at the moment
otakon wo a new record
yes
*wow
cow334: Yes
@pokemon

11,01If you all think greed is good, enjoy being run by RIAA and MPAA, because they're very fucking greedy.
otakon x insanity?
Alister: If you want a system where everyone gets covered, everyone has to participate in some way.
/me jumps up and down
Reikim: who is
Gastly
DocSane : Well like I said Death is something that happens. Some people aren't lucky. it's the real world
Coolio
lol Krakass dont think its the right time for that
11,01Seriously.
Whoah, Calm down Nittany_Discord
dafaq is going on in this chat?
I have no idea,
twilight_sprinkle never thought of it that way....
Nittany_Discord: I didn't say greed was good. Personally I'm against it. I'm just noting its presence ini our society.
It's never the wrong time to ship him.
2,14 yes, I understand otakon, you're upset. And you can discuss that with the people responsible. Please, however, don't go about breaking even *more* rules
11,01But they're greedy.
The RIAA and MPAA are not greedy...they are stupid.
0,14*ahem*
ValtheJean: because Wrek has his bot set to 5 in 10 instead of 6 in 10, it stacked. SO, I'm pretty much bucked when it comes to entering messages in a timely matter.
DocSane : How about if people doN,t want those benefits don't give them the disavantages
*sigh* A business is a business. There will always be some catch to try and make more money.
0,14play nice now
11,01They are greedy.
Being greedy does not qaulify for being stupid
Time to play some Lego Digital Designer
Alister: If a person is ill and doesn;t have the cash to pay for treatment, are we willing to let them die on the steps of a hospital?
imo cursing is worse than allcapsing
Deadlypon3: they are stupid AND greedy
11,01They're trying to copyright every idea in existence to make money.
@pokemon
Nittany_Discord: Also I don't know what those are, sorry.
10 Shamroc is a/an 12 Cresselia
Activision and Ea were so greedy, they destroyed SO MANY great companies
but greed is is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, that what people seem to care mostly about now and days *some dont*
Let's uh...let's try and chill out a big, ok everypony? :$
...dont know what that is
Well, that's what a company does :P
Whether it would be for a cheapened experience, false advertising, or marketing in general
0,14^
The make money
I liek cookies.
Anyone see that new CRYSIS 3 GAME?
11,01RoflBot: Exactly.
0,14...damn, random chat jump
2,14 we're addressing that with him Otakon, until then just chill. In addition, *TRY* to say your sentences in one post
some legendary in gen4
Dashie_Dashie: nice
I think it's a pokemon
crysis 3? seriously?
And if they see a way to do it, why not?!
DocSane : Not I wont let them die , But I won't force anyone who will let them die to help them
Alister: Again, just by living in a society, you benefit from that society.
:-)
what color is Vinyl's eyes? I couldn't see the eyecolor

oh neat
11,01One of my favorite hobbies was ruined by greed.
/me apparently can only enter 1 message every 10 minutes now to avoid being kicked starting now.

@pokemon
ValtheJean: hello
14 Shamroc is a/an 0 Noctowl
I dunno, maybe
what gets me about RIAA/MPAA is they would rather not work with technology and make money, but just have everyone revert to the stone age
aha i am beter than TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
Hi everypony!
YOitzGEEZUS: magenta? maybe
Nittany_Discord: what was it if you dont mind me asking
Nittany_Discord: But to jump back a bit. You suggested that war drives progress.
@pokemon
hey YOitzGEEZUS
Who ?
Alright Nittany_Give me a heavenly virtue and I can point out how it can be a bad thing
allo YOitzGEEZUS
well fan style, Vinyls eyes are red. The actual color is magenta
anyways..... grumble grumble blah blah blah - POLITICS IN A NUTSHELL
Alister: That wasn't my question.
actually if you press the enter key very fast you wont trigger the script either > : )
@pokemon
Mike Jones
you are hoothoot im noctowl
YOitzGEEZUS they aren't going to be red, sadly, Hasbro did a vote with girls and they said red eyes were scary, so they're magenta
@pokemon
Pinkieeee :D

twilight_sprinkle: really
Everyone: SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE STREAM
Alister: Do you let the hospital let them die on the steps or not.
otakon_MUTED, your muted?
2,14 and that's the stream everyone
StinkomanFan: I think Aristotle already did that.
2,14 hope you enjoyed
11,01Thanks ValtheJean
cow334: i think so, it worked for me before
nope
YOitzGEEZUS: Same say magenta, but some people who are trying to prove that its red say that a grey overlay caused them to be magenta.
no i just think hes not gonna talk
=D
all goverments should= communist so we dont have to argue about it
0,14thanks for streaming, Val

Reikem, I am also a philosopher. It'll work out

oh noes
cow334: i meant as in writing something very fast
Alister: And who pays for that generosity?
just like pink = a shade of red
Its magenta. I think the board wanted to shoot for red but thought the contrast was too vibrant. (my opinion)
Thanks ValtheJean can we get some ponies before you go?
ha, you're the pedo pokemon

Now, like how the seven deadly sins can be used for good the seven heavenly virtues can be used for evil
... Dken2021 thats the childrens fault for not being smart enough to TELL APART THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN A BALLOON AND A POKEMON

however, without regulations, we'd have more... lead paint, and curium in our figurines :)
Machamp
Heck yeah
Alister: The problem is that having a system like that drives up the costs for everyone.
/me karate chops something in half
Shizuka needs to add a red/green light to indicate stream status for those that can't figure out when the streamer says "and that's the stream everyone" that the stream is done
If we're talking healthcare, I can safely say that I would either a) not exist, or b) be living in poverty if not for healthcare.
Then again, I laughed to the Pony Phoenix Wright too

DocSane : If Health is to be treated as an economy, it will obviously accomodate itself so they can have customers. that is hte base of capitalism
0,14not at the moment
DocSane: Totally in agreement. My family would likely not be able to survive in the US.
A what?
ok, thanks
but dammit all I'm tired of getting autokicked so damn much so often regardless of actual time between messages.
Shamroc then you will not move when we play l4d2
LunaTheBeloved, some ice type thing
you could type longer

Coolio
Alister: It would become like health care in 3rd World countries and in the past: only the rich get good health care.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT...not violent..just REALLY....agressive

Dken2021: then the message is out of time and they don't know what the hell I'm responding to.
well.. universal health care CAN be sustanable, BUT... not here, we have too large a population making not enough money to cover it tbh. It works in places like Norway, simply because they have a smaller population
who ?
NO STREAM?
Alister: Everyone else either gets none or very poor care.

@pokemon
Alister: So only rich people deserve to be healthy?
TALK ABOUT HEALTH CAIR!
Alister: Capitalism is a bit like communism. In theory they both work really well. In practice, they just don't take into account that humans are unredeemable bastards who can't seem to understand a problem when it looks them in the face.
@pokemon
0,14nope, no stream, Krakass =P

no vid?
D'awww
2,14 Sato: we use colors so that when we have important things to mention, like stream issues or embed switches you can all see it, EVEN during massive chat storms
You guys remember that one time we watch the Penn and Teller episode on Creationism and only got into an arguement about the definition of the word Theory
/me dies from cute overload
fillyfillyy: you could for a greater chance
Ninjazz: Lol:D
meh, I find cleffa cuter
so mods whats up with to stream?
And that's were I end my pokemon quest
@pokemon
so why not only use it when there is something important to mention? would sure increase the effectiveness

I imagine libertarian society would involve terrible roads and people never wanting to pay for any common services.

DocSane : I'd do it
ninjazz banning is a sport. ever heard of the ban hammer toss?
Alister: But it's not the idiots that will die off. Letting everyone look out for themselves just means that 1) we will have no progress, and 2) net intelligence will actually drop because people actually aren't willing to do anything for the common good. Not in general, anyway.
Oh, he's not even in here xD

Dark92Enigma: bye
I find it fascinating how the narratives’ of the books shift between the linguistic use of “god” and “gods”, and this actually (evident through archaeology) aligns with the back and forth shifting between one king, and many tribal leaders, of the ancient day. If archaeology has taught me one thing about religious text, it is that it is all political rhetoric of the ancient day.

How long is this video?
@pokemon
She was in Winter Wrap up

Yes!
/me 's eyes and ears have been invaded by epic proportions of epicosity
it's a losless AVI

Next episode air time is unknown.
you could try coreAVC otr FFSHOWV in WMP/MC
oh
TT_TT
:(
DAT UNKNOWN
your HD might be too slow?
Is that a bad format for this kind of playback?
:'(
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/12227 there's your apple bumpkin
and like I said
dat gmod derpy
VLC plays it full speed AFTER playing through the video completely
eh its late here, i probably wont be waiting for amnesia at thsi point, so thats one less vote for amnesia :3
I think it's some kind of RAM thing
lol
that could be your HD cache kicking in
you seriously cant wait a few months for ponies guys? just rewatch the episodes... geeze...

Yes yes...get on there
Ninjazz: idk, ive so far seen the opposite, after all, her only trait is kindness, and she turned otu to be a douche

Tell me how are you ? my most faithful student

that's a COMMISION
hmmmm
Twi is my 1st fav, then Rarity, then Trixie(i imagine her to unconfident inside) 4. everyone except fluttershy
Lyra is best pony
God tier: Everypony
flutter_spin how is Rainbow Dash at the bottom of you're bottom list?!?
Requests are "do this plz kthnx:

I feel like Mane6 top favorite lists only irritate other bronies now.
Roara it depends
Shit tier: nothing
do you have a rig?
/me destroys some Tyranids, LIKE A BAWS!
02I know
I very much hate competition
With a ton of controllers?
I'm doin quite well here in Ponyville, young Scootaloo is currently asleep on the couch right now
Well RD is at the bottom of my bf's favorites list o.o
IM A BOSS like a coss
Or are you doing rotating each bone individually
Ninjazz: lol everyone has their opinion
coww
which is a terrible idea might I add
So instead I now say "X is my favorite pony"
I never could relate to tomboys either
So...
/me spit takes
Ninjazz: what is it? only fluttershy irritates me
Rarity is my favorite pony. :#
Digitalis is a girl?!
:3
lonley island is best pony
I'm still waiting on Fighting is magic.
why would I use a ton of controllers
0,14^
Yeah I am a girl, duh :P
so your workflow is easier
I'm literally in my first month of animating
ah
/me 11,01pets Digitalis
Well I mean
in order, mine would probably never show based on number of people in the channel and i've been in for 10 minutes; usually a bad mix
eep!

lol he is a baws

Because he can't b curious?

I REALLY think Applejack could go higher, but there doesn't seem any good storylines with her. She intimates me as a strong character, but I wouldn't mind seeing a more softer side

She is a pony though, so she's better than humans.
cow334: no, you will heretic...
Ninjazz: exactly ^^
02how much do you charge to do a commission? derp
cow334 I didn't say that, it's only natural for people to be curious
03you got school toorrow?
03*tomorrow
I think the only thing that attracts me to Rainbow Dash is her curiosity in things that she doesn't have a grasp on. It shows her weakness and something she doesn't view as mere sport or competition
Digitalis: dat self esteem, lol
So what if I'm tired; tomorrow's the day I don't even NEED effort
Terminator_Tempest: cow powers intationateing
also, apparently NJ won in 2OT.

ohia SuperBrony64
Guys watch the whole thing Nittany will do something he doesnt like
Best part! ^__^
Jaketehsnake: TYP
because so few people enjoy rigging when it's serious
11,01No.
03ugh
Its alright dear, its only a dream
lol
03I have a feeling this Ustream site is going to be a nightmare to leech
who made this?
11,01You'll have to endure 20 mins or so.
Nittany_Discord: are they ponys
a small piece of me just died by this....
saxy you online?
lol
03I wish I knew someone in Texas who could record TV
WE NEED TO TALK
11,01They are mutant ponies.
God, this is painful
white ponies have more plot than this!
Erm moddler
Though rigging helps with the workflow but when you're in a team, you don't need to do everything yourself lol
Heheh
Oh lol
0,14eenope, Pinkies4thWall ;_;
Roara I love rigging
i'm going to overplay the Discord Remix
On your xbox?
Why do their diapers have cutie marks?

U SRS?
0,14MOTHER OF GOD, SB

NEVAH!
11,02Yesh :3
11,01Where and when?
wow

as awesome as the song I'm listenting to currently instead of the stream , it doesn't help
/me brings Shamroc a glass of water
SuperBrony64: WOW RELLY were
11,02Tonight like an hour ago
02Why does everyone take me so serious when I joke? :(
SuperBrony64, You got Johns AUTOGAPH?
Because like, you get to have your model gain the mos amount of accuracy in any animation yiu make
This is VERY useful for game animations where everything has to flow
Yes I'm serious
Having a rig available saves the animator so much time
we only have two riggers this generaton
SuperBrony64: YOU ARE KIDDING! HOW?
SuperBrony64 Im jelly
generation
/me slowly drinks the glass
Lol
03what's a rigger o.o
11,02At UC Merced, he was giving a talk on Entrepeneurship.
I'm friends with both
:O
drf, basically
Inb4racistjoke
you make a model
/me hide
of water
IT HUNGERS FOR BLOOD
lol
SB64, IS HE A BRONY?
didnt pull a discord there
rigging is essentially the skeleton and muscles
O_O
SuperBrony64: LIKE A BOSS that is awsome
LunaTheBeloved: I don't think so dear
you make the geometry move
Yeah
03oh
SuperBrony64, DISCORD! Did you ask anything about his character
One can hope
that's so awesome SB64
it sounds easy, but there's SO MUCH involved
03so like the mechanical aspect?
11,01Why would an actor give a talk on entrepeneurship?
Yep
11,01sp?
yep
03OK
this show is so bad, it's below Discord levels
Nittany_Discord: people have secrets some times
Though
it can be so hard
SuperBrony64: you are now the coolest person ever... can... can i hug you?
11,02No, he was really busy with other people, so I kind of just complimented his speech and asked for an autograph >>
that house is the best thing in the show
Assuming that Discord isn't awesome...
I'm not good at rigging that much
11,02I feel kind of bad about it .__.
the zippleback from HTTYD has 1000+ controls
When t comes to WEIGHS
but
Wow, that was bad.
lol
dear princess celestia, kill me now.
Controllers are super useful

/me nuzzles SlurryMoon

Caps are appropriate

We'll need pics

11,02Sure thing ^-^

Pixar is like more than boss actually
11,01Pinkies4thWall: Did you link that special in #vinyl_scratch?
11,01I don't have The Room.
that's like Geography 1
They made their own renderer for crying out loud!
oh....thank you
Nittany_Discord: yup
11,01Unless it's a mod.
um
And its one of the best in the buisness
most studios do lol
hopehully Molestia doesnt show up in your bed
True
studios have their own programs these days
it's a direct link to the video
He's on the couch so no harm
PSN SUCKS!
But it's still one of the best xP
WAHHHH LunaTheBeloved!
Oh god i cant sleep but im soooooooooooo tired
^^
all are
not really
hes creepy!
otakon: is XBL better?
CREEPYNESS!
it took SEVEN HOURS to DL a 1.25 GB demo
well
rendering yeah
Oh?
otakon: just your opionion
Its just a joke Scoots
03anyway
but they're not really pushing things much anymore
Just a joke
03I need to reboot, stupid DVD burner locked up on me
No go to sleep
lol otakon at least its free
CrimsonPhoenix: it only took 2 hours to download the same thing
Yeah
What do you have against renderman
:U
3hm?
Nittany_Discord: what games ar you going to play
3what's wrong? :<
PSN is free so... Wutever.
*now
amnesia
DWS is the only studio that's really pushing graphics and computer limits
lol
Ninjazz: SEVEN HOURS
Pixar used this linux/unix one from 1995-2001 ish?
Nothing hon
otakon: :/ Free.
were both hooked?
FREE!
Ninjazz: it takes my 360 only an hour and a half
Renderman isn't that old is it?
o.o
TheHoodyNinja: I'm paying for Playstation Plus
psn might be free but the extras for it are high in price
mbdn0
3Alright, I hope everyone's doing okay.
What.
lol otakon sucks to be you
Someone called molesti... i mean celestia ?
/me nuzzles SlurryMoon
otakon: Can't argue with you on that. But I refuse to give Micro$oft more than they deserve.
360 ftw
Its fine`
~
CrimsonPhoenix that depends on where you live, Vancouver area, wet. Island, wet. Where I am, it varies, cuz living in the "Bowl City" gives you smog, rain, on-and-off winds, AND cold.
Anyway apparently SEGA uses Pixar's rendering engine
I'm just wondering why it takes nearly three times as long to download the same amount of data
/me nuzzles LunaTheBeloved softly
11,01Done.
MahBoi777: you have xbox live
It went international lol
Nittany_Discord: what are you going to play
11,01Dunno.

Yay six flags
CrimsonPhoenix: not as the same time
Pinkies4thWall is this your video?
Ninjazz: wut about it
/me whispers "amnesia"...
I think the only thing I will watch at this point game-wise is Amnesia
mhm
cow334: lol no, my lousy internet isn't compatible, but I like the xbox 360
but you hooked both?
And Valve admittedly based TF2 off Pixar's films, yes?
Nittany_Discord can i have the name of this one please ?
I wanna see just how bad it is. Make sure to play it with a headset on too. I wanna hear your frustations >:3
Pinkies4thWall Nicw
The art style I mean
nice*
Amnesia would keep me up probably....
MahBoi777: lol well that is cool im sorry to hear that
uh
CrimsonPhoenix: what do you mean? as in to the same internet? yes. but they aren't on at the same time usually
thats news to me
yeah, id stay up 20-30 more mins for amnesia
I don't want to be spoiled in ME3 so I'm still avoiding that.
Always with the Amnesia...
anypony need a pm link?
still awake here ponys..
Really? I read somewhere that TF2's art style was made to be like Pixar's animated films
Ninjazz: its a good game for watching lol
/me is not scared by amnesia

wait, I'm a wallmaster, I dont say anything.
/me stomps around the chat, chasing Digitalis

Hai Tovler
/me runs for 5 seconds, then passes out
So what happens when WallMaster and Pinkies4thWall meet?
5th wall?
All this running is making me miss Fwuffy.
:'(
/me dances on Tempestzilla s head
considering what a wallmaster does, probably just drag her back to her house.
DeathStar: RAWR! *translation* 'Yay!'
*takes off imaginary sunglasses*0_0 dear Celestia helps us all if that happens
Tempestzilla: why are you so scary today?
alright, bed time
I know any tolerating and loving will be matched by your own Ninjazz, so going on with this is pointless
Goodnight flutter_spin :3
Gnight flutter_spin
