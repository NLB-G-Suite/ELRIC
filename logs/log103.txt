The creepypasta
With the ponies and the screaming
And the scariness
i dont find taht all that bad
I do too, it was called Battlefield Bad Company 2.
are u guys honestly scared by that like no joke?
A bit!
Honestly, I can't look straight at it.
i've seen... much.. much worse
I'm somewhat young...and it's the middle of the night.
And there's a tornado warning
It's 1:39 AM here, and even though I'm 18, I'm scared shitless of that sort of thing..
maybe
In all honesty, no lie, I'm a middle-schooler
Soo...
its a picture?
Good for you.
he laughed at it
We are glad you are unaffected by it
._. i just rememebred a story
if you guys want something actually scary
However, we are affected, and I want to sleep at least minimally tonight
About?

*hit by train*
Are you all fanboy/fangirl squealing about S2 like I am?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAbRIXBTII&feature=related
I was when I noticed it.
then for some reason i stared at it cuz i put my fruit on the endtable
if you enter a place that is supposedly haunted you are pre-dispositioned to attribute any unexplained occurences to the paranormal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM
Oh my gosh, didn't we leave this topic already?
and its weird i wasnt scared i was like whatever and went back to watching tv
fruit cups are moist
tables can be slippery
do the math
i posted two videos to end the conversation
Thanks
When I'm scared
no dude would this thing slide across a flat surface after being still for about 10 secs to the other side of it
:3
._.
Well I'm..m here and there.. cause I'm playing Battlefield at

you were 11
>implying 11 year olds aren't aware of the world
i wasnt the only person in that house that weird shit happen too

I generally dislike football
American football, that is.
i like football and MMA
To clear up any confusion
I generally dislike sports
I like street fighting
Jenemmy; same here

._.
Lol high school/middle school.
I hop.
I skip.
Listen to music while you sleep jen?
But when I do, I don't get off the ground.
Nah.
Do you?
Very rarely.
Why?
Distracts me, I just clear my mind.
Too distracting
Try to..
Especially music with voices in it
Just think of nothing.
Literally, think of nothing.
I've tried
I liSten to thrash metal when I sleep
When I do, the creepiest things create themselves in my head.
my mind is horrible... i always think
It's relaxing
Xaceno, same problem
At least you think, right?
You and I are somewhat alike, you know.
i need to replace my battery on my laptop and it can only stay on it the chargers on
._.
i accidently unplugged it
Oh yeah, speaking of computers, I've officially lost it.
I just focus on the music
I baked my 8800GT, reapplied thermal paste, and it was working again.
hardly... i think about everything...
I loved astronomy
Love*
But movie ad TV always come up at night
When I'm relaxed
For some reason
Oh, and games
Lots of 'em
then end up writing...
mainly about the moon
or stars
i feel like watching Mauskau
I just close my eyes and think of nothing.
THen I'm awake.
the night sky
to be exact
?
IMO
Nothing quite a sight.
when i'm up at 3am... and everyone else is gone.. i still always have the moon...
I prefer watching the purple sky just as the sun went down.
my friend unwavering...
I like seeing the visuliser on
I do too
Especially when it's rockin along with me and Coheed and Cambria or 5FDP
an exact quote from a writing assignment i had for school not too long ago...
coheeds decent
i like em
Factory
Fatigue...
Catching up to me...
I'm obsessed with coheed for a while
I switch obsessions alot..

WHY
U SEND ME DIS
Hai
I WIN
Neat, but how did you get it printed out?
its a nice image
I created the PDF and went to the local Fedex/Kinko's and asked them to print them in high-quality laser paper for me
That poster cost me about $15
Did it not feel awkward asking them to print that out for you?
XD
haha, yeah, most people don't have printers that large, cost is mostly the paper and ink
(Funny story? The PDF was 800 megs long, it took their printer over an hour to print all 36 pages)
oh, that's a raster image?
I kinda want to do that with the comic con pony poster
Yep! 6x6 letter-sized pages wide
hehe, I win again!
hey guys

They did "NOT THE ORPHANS!" first?
SOMEONE is going to get incredibly pissed off that their particular variation of luna fanon is not canon
wow, I missed that
lol
luna is best pony

I don't even care if she's any way related to any form of fanon, if she's a solid character I'll be fine

Someone's always going to be pissed, though.

EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
not you too Denied!
4Well
3What? Is it bad to have a face?
4They can be bad
OCs are unilaterally OCs, and not canon. As long as people treat them as OCs, I'm fine with them.

10I just don't agree
3Well those people are stupid
3Just because a book is good, doesn't mean everyone should read it
Though they only have 3 levels done though.
first 5 chapters? Fair enough. I can abide by this
10DamnedBook people do that though :P
but then I read Dangerous Business
can I get a link or something? or do I have to browse through EQD >.<

LUNA. DO NOT TOUCH THIS CREATURE

just waay too slow

I wish I could get Luna hugs too :(
can you actually replace every piece of hardware in a mac yet?
/me likes this plan
Cat: not at all.
Cam: Or want a decent OS
integrated graphics cards suck.
Don't start it again.
hehe
fine
pretty much all entertainment is a waste of time if you get down to it
Elusive's one was awesome
it just happens that that same hardware also runs games awesomely
Cat: then I would definitely recommend a computer customized for that.
if you dont wnat the server, I can just remove yer user ;)
ubuntu is universal though
I like tha
no
:/
I suppose not
I'll copy my configs and leave if you'd like.
nah
the mac pro probably doesn't have a top of the range processor
not that mine is anymore either

it is well drawn, but i can not be swayed by Dashfire that easilly

i dislike hippocampi for the sake of they creep me out, as do most sea creatures of the like.
I would
Cat: You have experience with linking IRC server?
I have no desire to see sea ponies in G4
Servers *
I have absolutely no idea when it comes to that
Only as a one-off though, probably
if they revamp it and make them less abomination-like, i could learn to accept them, but never like. too creepy

But that's kind of my point, Silvermane, if they're done in G4 style then how are they abominations?
NOTHING CAN STOP HIM
shmooze...?
that sound...
I wouldn't want to see G1 sea ponies in G4, either. :P
That would be the scariest thing of all time.
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT

For shits and giggles.
how?
Horses aren't meant to have wings, either. :P
Posted it in the pony thread on the MSPA forums. :p
yes, but those are more natural from mythology
about 2 tonnes in all
But... mythological sea horses...
:O YOU HAVE HORSES?
and we had masks on to avoid breathing it in, but it still went in my eyes
there is no mythology involving sea ponies essentially. They're just a stupid twist of mermaids and sea horses

yes

Fanfics are never canon. They are a good read, but if there is one thing they aren't, it is canon.
seems fine to me
Yeah right.
Abacus is canon
cause i rememver monster like that from Metro i think
Rainbow Factory is canon
Anyone know how to get synchtube to work?
cause it won't even load the homepage for me
Cameras are canon
take them or i'll get angry
or Canon, rather
