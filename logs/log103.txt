FRIEN... er.. wait... MAGIC!!!
season 2 will start off with them having to collect the elements of harmony again

i want the crown WHY U SO SPECIAL
*get really epic jewerly. Never wear them*
Seriously, why is the background music so... unbelievably awesome?
they just swaped background and fore ground sounds for these, so you will hear any talking done off camera.
IM GONNA TELL PRINCESS MOLESTIA ON YOU TWILIGHT
uh-oh
I still get a little creeped out by Twilight's blank white eyes.
;)

I don't think Perl would actually work.

I'm a bit confused on that TBH
13Images meant to cause great shock.
im sowwy
ah
PATTON!
13Things like Cupcakes. That would be gore and shock.
13Which are both against the rules. :P
I see :P
13 1.21 giggawatts!
cupcakes... dont be to hasty
What the hell is a jiggawatt?
but its not gory
3Princess, PM
what about the image on the cupcakes tvtropes page? It's not really shocking on its own
o
the creepy pie pic isnt gorry
13That wasnt gory, but it was Cupcakes. Borderline :P
Twilight is the new evil leader
the zalgo pie pic?
the wormy flutter is creepier
what about....
PONIES STOPPED HITLER
http://familyfun.go.com/assets/cms/recipes/taste-a-rainbow-cupcakes-photo-420-FF0310TOTMA01.jpg
13Just try and keep the Cupcakes to PMs

hey guys, who's streaming?
i would choose spike
Rainbow Dash and Rarity are tied with me
pinky
i used to hate rarity..
We talking about favourite pony now?
Yeah..
Rarity is awesome how could yoooooouuuuuu
and twilight sparkle
not untill my 3rd time through the season did i see her brilliance...
she uses spike as slave labor though
and flutershy
I'm going off the board and picking Vinyl Scratch even though she has absolutely no characterization within the show itself.
Rarity is a great character her voice actor is excellent
DjP0n-3?
Yes.
yes i love dj pon-3
<---
i see
i saw a girl at my school that had a dj pon-3 shirt on...
OMG! Someone names after the DJ likes Vinyl Scratch?! :O
DO WANT

i see nothing wrong with that
give pinkie a hug
i'd think she needs a hug
i would too
Oh my god.
or i would say "i like trains" and hope that i get the reaction that it gets in asdf movies
Pinkie plays Portal and actually gets cake
It's ok, not like I needed sleep, ya know.
ok good trollight
*checks my dA* still nothing

i guess
that would be awesome
i can try
im always up for ultra violence
is there a way to stream your desktop on synchtube?

says bad gateway wha? i think the sites down temp.
i'f i were watching the show in plain view of family members... would they question if i'm watching something... a little less... wholesome...
how old are you?
Elfen Lied has naked girls, blood, and gore
._. the intro appeared to have a little more nudity than the amvs i saw of the show
the intro of the show yes shows some tits
i noticed
how old are you
._. 15
ahh so your a lil filly
hurr see what i did there
depending on what you mean by lil...
do i have to bring ponies into everything now?

Hmm..

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClXAaGoT5eE
im only 16, but my parents are asleep so it doesnt matter

Me
Possibly
3 i think
hai
Hallo
*fail*
im here
silently
*sneaks away
ay... i did that last night
8bit time
thought you went to bed
13Someone said my name a while back.. my Molestia senses are tingling...
8bit what?
no its me, xeno, trollight, decap, and shiggy i guess
oh molestia too
that was me
well... and twilight
is she asleep?
13To the Molestmobile!
the stream thing im still listening to the music
sudden burst of ponies
I get a bad feeling from those.. senses.
13Or the "party van"
im assuming twilight your a girl
*A sudden change of events&
yes, twilight sparkle is a girl
is molestia?
the character is... i think he was questioning the account
He probably was
gender list... nowe
Guy
guy
duh like i dont know the character is a girl pony
Guy here.
*ponits to twilight and molest*
dari si a bot
points*
is there any girl bronys here im just wondering because it does seem hard to find dont it?
You sure?
yeah dat
13I'm special. lol
Yes... YES... love this song...
Technically a girl brony would be a "pegasis"..
when did dashite get here?
See what I did there?
Dashite is always here.
i know 4 in person...
TwilightSparkle are you a pegasis i guess go with what trollight said?
IRC Dashite is watching you chat.
Sure why not?
my sister, my lesbian friend... another 2 girls from school
so...
:0
yay for ponies
Indeed
has the term pegasister caught on yet?
:0 :0
i would think so
Not really, just saw it around
:0 :0 :0
i'm not sure... i used it and was stared at odd...
13Pegasister... oi /facehoof
among bronies
Wait...
im just wondering cuz should we think of a name for female fans of the show i mean we got bronys
?
can't bronies be gender nutral
it can
13I just used the term Bronies for anyone who's a fan.
Are you alive? Dari? :o
13*use
but i like to think creatively
likewise
Same here
i dont know how many female fans do u see in mlp fandom stuff
like dis
more than you'd think
13There are some.
i got a point now dont i cuz it seems like we're all bronys
id assume that most female fans wouldnt be vocal about their gender
._.
u know whats weird
I know 1 person irl who's a partial brony, and that's it. And he's a guy too. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ACfEBYic1BQ/ThiBcAFxsmI/AAAAAAAAA84/idyU3JZtvGA/s1600/forever-alone-face.jpg
whenever i see some girl on the internet... well, lets just say anonymity doesnt create a friendly environment
*cough* ... why do pills smell horrible... especially Nexium...
only in mk people specify their gender
like always i see "who wants to fight a girl" and stuff like that
Well there are the 12 year olds, the ones that overdo the kitchen jokes, etc on the internet.
thats stupid
Oh, SR... I am calling off, I am not mad anymore.
13Make me a sammich!
Aw.. yes ma'am. ._.
13lol
I'm like "lol" happy right now.
13;)
girls arent in my kitchen they're in my bed
moral... episode 19...
13What was that joke...
13Involving a girl getting hit by a car...
what are we talking about?
13What was a car doing in the kitchen?
*hands everypony muffins*
._. not very funny one....?
And now, time for afk.
xaneco, i wouldnt watch elfen infront of your family
got it...
:0
yea it is a pretty graphic show
13Elfen isnt a bad anime. A bit intense
i know that joke
i love Elfen Lied
IT HAS ULTRA VIOLENCE!
its one of my favs
my sister is asleep behind me... my roommate a room away watching star trek...
parents asleep i think...
13Yay Star Trek
And I'm here! You can take down those roadblocks now
its like, a man drives a woman over with his car, who's fault is it? A: the mans fault for driving in the kitchen
never know
my friend told me this really sexist joke he heard the other day
why are there so many....
what do you tell a woman with 2 black eyes?
it's not even funny
nothing, she's laready been told twice
i know that one...
yea
13lol
i know a different answer though
i seen this pick on the internet that was really funny but sexist
umm
it was an answer this kid wrote on his test
ok, when a man tells a woman to go make him a sandwich, whats a good comeback for the girl?
13I find them funny. Theyre in fun. I'm not so stingy I cant joke about stuff even if it pertains to me.
i like antijokes
._.
on the test it was a math question and in the question it said that this lady in the problem was wrong in her math why is she?
13She better come back with a sandwich!
he put because shes a woman
on his test
lol
13Oh yeah lol
what's worse than finding a worm in your apple...?
13Remember that one
the holocaust...
13Wat?
13...
wtf?
13I.. dont get it? lol
I'm back! And I've created a giant, delectable sammich for all to partake.
why did the boy drop his ice cream...?
13Yes... the holocaust WOULD be worse.. lol
i know some blond jokes
Ok im back my sis just got off.
Why can't a blond count to 70?
Why?
cuz 69 is a mouthful
Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
Ha
._.
13Ooooooh
13Lmao
I'm a horrible person ._,
13I am too.
13I know that feel bro
What's the difference between a blond guy and blond girl?
gender
fortunately i'm an amazing person, so it balances out.
Hi, Guys.
the blond girl has a higher sperm count
Hello.
._.
lol
OHOHOOH
ok
13XD
I came not because CottonCow's broadcast ended
i have a poem
Why was six afraid of seven?
Cause seven eight nine
It wasn't. Numbers are not sentient and thus incapable of feeling fear.
they are numbers and have no emotions
Because Seven obtained an axe?
I ruined it :)
ever saw the movie The Sexy Pirate?
ITS RATED ARGHHHHHH
Or was it because numerals are incapable of expressing emotion?
lol thats so corny
Roses are red, violets are blue
I have a gun, get in the van
ok
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0PIdWdw15U
An hawk and a squirrel are on a tree branch watching a farmer, and the squirrel turns to the hawk and says nothing as squirrels can not talk, and the hawk eats the squirrel because it is a bird of prey.
Roses are red, my deck is tan.
cancer...
I have a gun, get in the van.
Better.
I have one.
:3
Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
it was dead...?
yes Xaneco

Well to be honest, they are, but not as bad as creepypasta..
And don't get me started on some types of creepypasta.
._.
creepy pasta isnt scary
ok
Really, let's stop altogether and talk about My Little Pony

And the scariness
i dont find taht all that bad
I do too, it was called Battlefield Bad Company 2.
are u guys honestly scared by that like no joke?
A bit!
im not
Honestly, I can't look straight at it.
i've seen... much.. much worse
I'm somewhat young...and it's the middle of the night.
So, yes.
And there's a tornado warning
but its not scary i can see a lil kid being scared by it
It's 1:39 AM here, and even though I'm 18, I'm scared shitless of that sort of thing..
maybe
In all honesty, no lie, I'm a middle-schooler
i pmed pon3 something... i thought he would like it more than you guys
Soo...
its a picture?
dude my 3 yr old cousin saw that Pinkie Pie screamer and didnt even jump
im 16 and im not scared of it
Good for you.
he laughed at it
We are glad you are unaffected by it
._. i just rememebred a story
if you guys want something actually scary
However, we are affected, and I want to sleep at least minimally tonight
About?
someone died
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90JCY0Eh1s4
the end
ive been to a real haunted house before
Please, seriously
ive been to the myrtles plantation
my older cousin was at my house and i was scrolling through youtube...
accidentally ran into a screamer
Go to creepypasta chat or something if you want to talk about these things
ive been to a haunted house
its not even actually scary?
Stop it!
he screamed and cried and made his parents bring him home
i linked a simple song
nothing more
well nothing happend to me but i got some weird pictures
Okay
Still
my friends house is haunted
Still, when it's early in the morning, and it's dark in your room, and everybody's asleep, you can't help but feel.. strange.
._.
Sorry, but I'm really paranoid about these things.
and so is my bros friends house
I am too.
thats higher intelligence for you
Extremely
my friend tho pissed off the ghost i think
Actually
something jumped out at me, i broke its neck, or what can be called its neck
0_0
that made it more pissed
he was in a chair and it moved and he yelled "STOP THAT YOU FUCKIN GHOST!" then he was hit in the head with a toy car
Something jumped out at me.. it was a bunny. I named it George and took it home.
none of us did it cuz we were in the back room
now it lives in my basement
Really, quit it, I sit basically alone everyday and my eyes are already wandering towards my bedroom and closet doors.
I SAID QUIT IT, CONSARNIT.
ive experienced ghost before when i was 11
they're joking
hes funny
-facepalm-
cmon guys, respect everypony
im sorry guys, hate to break it to you but ghosts arent real
You're making it hard to love and tolerate you.
what im just teling a true story
*agrees with shiggy*
i was watching ducktales too when it happened
lol
I <3 ducks
Bit of advice jen.. keep the lights on. It's what I do alot.
something actually did jump out at me in a haunted house
They're so nice to watch
probably some kind of animal
turned out it was the hobo that lived there
or your mind playing tricks on you
P.S. My lights are on
thats just those manmade haunted house like House of Shock
the human mind is still a big unknown
Mine too.. >.>
So, anywho.
i like trains
but i was 11 and at my grandmaws house and was eating a fruit cup
*hit by train*
Are you all fanboy/fangirl squealing about S2 like I am?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAbRIXBTII&feature=related
yay someone finally said that
I was when I noticed it.
then for some reason i stared at it cuz i put my fruit on the endtable
if you enter a place that is supposedly haunted you are pre-dispositioned to attribute any unexplained occurences to the paranormal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM
it moved across the whole table on its on
Oh my gosh, didn't we leave this topic already?
You're ghost fruitcup doesn't concern me!
and its weird i wasnt scared i was like whatever and went back to watching tv
i placed a land mine in a haunted house, its non lethal though, but it will be funny!
fruit cups are moist
tables can be slippery
do the math
i think about and wonder why wasnt i scared?
i posted two videos to end the conversation
Thanks
Now looping Giggle at the Ghosties like I do
When I'm scared
no dude would this thing slide across a flat surface after being still for about 10 secs to the other side of it
:3
._.
the fruit cup is cold
Well I'm..m here and there.. cause I'm playing Battlefield at
atm*
it doesnt matter how "flat" the surface is
Stream over?
the stream
...
Yeahh
a cold fruit cup will me moist
sad
i was listening
be*
yea a moist fruit cup i grabbed it out the pantry it wasnt cold
just an fyi
What stream?
...
Sathi was streaming music.
The purpose?
Oh
Oh, ok.
yep
I thought you meant movies.
Nah
juice from the cup could have spilled over
http://www.sacred-messages.com/wp-content/uploads/storage/Fine%20Art%20-%20Garden%20Within%20Forest%20Stream.jpg
You're back!
I was about to say
listened to every one
idk, how old were you when this happened?
"The entire purpose of this site"?
Xaneco, I see what you did there.
I don't :P
._.
..
i was 11 and the way it moved is that it stayed upright and slide from exactly one side to the other
you were 11
>implying 11 year olds aren't aware of the world
i wasnt the only person in that house that weird shit happen too
11 year olds are messy, some juice could have spilled over the side of the cup
mkay... we're done here... convorsation has run dry...
True
Eleven year olds are really dirty
lovetolerateforget
NO MORE GHOSTS
humans are dirty creatures...
im using logic
Time for ponies ^^
nomatter the age
i know what i saw and if u did ud shit ur pants
>.>
different shit can happen that you would never imagine based on simple physics
THIS TOPIC HAS RUN DRY
i never did scare easy tho
ANYTHING RELATING TO SCARY AND GHOST WILL BE SPAMMED OUT

._.
The topic is just annoying after a while
Yet nobody is listening to me
air currents from outside will cause the doors to open
i like paranormal shit
_.
I'm listening to everybody.
i'd sitting on the sidelines
this all started over a pony pic tho
thats how conversations work
A very creepy one, imo.
._.
Like 4chan.

I came here originally for shits + giggles
i really dont understand 4chan, but i guess
And now I get...this.

word of advice
it isnt
Don't worry, I'm not clicking anything.
its a kids video
im stopping with the ghost stuff now
...kids?
nah, just... odd... and kinda creepy... in its own awesome way
And it's creepy?

not really
lets all giggle at ghosties instead
mkay

Thanx guys

I want to take tje ears off...but I can't.
Lol high school/middle school.
I hop.
I skip.
Listen to music while you sleep jen?
But when I do, I don't get off the ground.
Nah.
Do you?
Very rarely.
Why?
What were you trying to recommend?
Distracts me, I just clear my mind.
all I do in school is make stuff in 3Ds Max
Ah.
Too distracting
Try to..
Especially music with voices in it
Just think of nothing.
Literally, think of nothing.
god... that's my problem
I've tried
I liSten to thrash metal when I sleep
When I do, the creepiest things create themselves in my head.
my mind is horrible... i always think
I used to be big in thrash.
It's relaxing
oopsie
Xaceno, same problem
and i love to think though
At least you think, right?
You and I are somewhat alike, you know.
i need to replace my battery on my laptop and it can only stay on it the chargers on
._.
i accidently unplugged it
Does your dark humor and jokes catch up to you at night?
Oh yeah, speaking of computers, I've officially lost it.
I just focus on the music
Lost what?
Himself
I baked my 8800GT, reapplied thermal paste, and it was working again.
Sweet, sweet Crysis.
hardly... i think about everything...
from video games... to life... to astronomy
who put down that evrytime we log in i see rainbow dash is the best pony?
Never was a big fan of astronomy
I loved astronomy
Love*
But movie ad TV always come up at night
When I'm relaxed
For some reason
Oh, and games
Lots of 'em
i just lay in bed and think all night usually...
then end up writing...
mainly about the moon
or stars
i feel like watching Mauskau
I just close my eyes and think of nothing.
I take it you're a fan of the sky?
THen I'm awake.
the night sky
And I am a fan of the sky
to be exact
Nothing like seeing the Milky Way at midnight.
?
IMO
Nothing quite a sight.
I don't see what everyone's infatuation with sunset's are.
when i'm up at 3am... and everyone else is gone.. i still always have the moon...
I prefer watching the purple sky just as the sun went down.
my friend unwavering...
I like seeing the visuliser on
my pc
I do too
Especially when it's rockin along with me and Coheed and Cambria or 5FDP
an exact quote from a writing assignment i had for school not too long ago...
coheeds decent
i like em
I lime chimaira and fear
Factory
Fatigue...
Catching up to me...
I'm obsessed with coheed for a while
is Moskau german?
I switch obsessions alot..
Thanks to you all, I think I might be able to sleep tonight
Thanks
"I am from restless nights, Only the stars shine on. Without them I am alone and confused, When there is no one else, they stay by my side as friends unwavering."
You're welcome

Espy
Lacopa

chat*

i knew you were scary from the start... hours ago....
but u xeno are unknown and fluttercry
i know u did
when the char showed up and did the same pic i though... ay...
duh i was expecting u to know
mhm...
all of the above
One and the same.
switching between 3 i only got 2 up
?_?
espy just like wtf is going on
Wait. Waitwaitwait. . .wait.
You lot are trying to /troll/ me?
Now that's hilarious.
im on THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Quite a large amount different actually.

Thank you.
im scary pie and of course this
im this
and this
Plus this as well.
xeno is unknown fluttercry and himself
we're all crazy here... by that i mean... i'm just screwing around at 3:45am
Odd.
yep
sorry i exited out for a second
he never said anything
might be afk
Possibly.
or just quiet
Or typing.
or just thinking im crazy
all of the above would work
To be completely fair.
hes right
.
WASSUP
hey
hi
lol
Hello.
4I WASNT LYING
I see.
lol
odd
um
was that you pon-3
just a guess
Probably not.
hey
hey
sup
Hello.
13WHAT HAPPENS IF I USE COLORS?
lol
like those
mkay
quarter to six AM here.
i need to do that on here tomorow
Listening to the wind and rain outside.
i wish
love the rain
Should be soon.
fun
its almost 5 am here
i should at least get some sleep
almost
4
here.
._.
>_>
why not screw around... i can...
eh
lol
True enough.
are there any mods here?
take a guess...
at who im like
In actuality.
fluttercry
and i think all afk
and nope... i'm me... those two are figments
fufufufufu
aw
That's quite rude.
._.
fluttercry gotta stick up her ass
Why I'd never!
ok i lost the believability
i dislike "1337" speak immensly...
hard 2 do this
now your sounding like your forcing the proper speech
if you're gonna make a character u gotta make him or her believable
I am partially OCD, so the proper is easier. Though I don't act too "snobish".
i am pretty quiet
and i like ._.
and ...
like how would she act if i go
far too much for my own good
fluttercry needs to get laid
or shes a bitch
Oh graciousness! How dare you speak with such insolence!
to the moooooooooan
beeeeeyitch!
see i just can't take u serious now
not one these 2
Not on these two.
this is pretty well serious though
either fluttercry seems like she would just ignore it and not care
she did change over time...
or just call us immature in an intelligent way
WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING!
Why so serious?
At first she acted quite like that.
but then i couldnt have these 2 fight now could i
Quite
kbkfnohfa
so i altered the characer
um
._.
What was that?
if i take a hold of fluttercry id make her act like this girl i know joanna
she always thinks shes smarter than everyone and trys to be like that
Explain said "Joanna"
http://justjudyjudyjudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pony-joker.jpg
Ah. I completely understand what you mean.
i know shes smart but shes not very humble about it
lol jokerpony
yeah, ive met that type
she gets on my nerves i mean we were friends but i was the only one in the group to question her or correct her
she didnt like that
lol
I wouldn't expect her to.
if you met me in real life, im quiet. sit in the corner... not talking...
me im the outgoing type and really the one who jokes around alot
but around the friends i've known for awhile, i'm a little louder
i get almost like a geek that has friends
well dude i need to get some sleep
its 5 am
Brilliant idea.
i think i'll watch elfen lied
then sleep
imma be back tonight for the 3rd lotr movie i guess i got nothing to do later on today
but i g2g
Never-the-less. I will see you next time.
mhm

I cant wait
Im suffering from withdrawal
I have downloaded the entire first season in HD h.264 mkv format
A 17gb file in total
It took 2 days to download.
>yfw Thiessen let something slip about GRANNY SMITH being epically awesome in S2
What? Lol
I can only imagine what that could mean
"sometimes its Pinkie.. but sometimes it's fluttershy.. but sometimes its rainbow dash, but sometimes its rarity... but sometimes is twilight.. but sometimes is applejack... spike too.. they all have great moments and characters.. its part of what makes the show great. granny smith is funny too.. but thats more of a season two thing. OOPS!"
>mfw some of Jayson Thiessen's answers are GOLDEN.

9not much people today. Guess word about Giant Robot Saturday Night didn't spread
9I'm okay
9gotta read Les Miserables for Literature Class
9love the book
9hate my deadline
They gave the message yesterday
9I finished Part 1 yesterday
I think they said it would be midnight right after the movie
o hai newdcd
9nah I said 12 PM Sunday
9as in inhalf an hour
oh
9since there's not many people around, though
9I think I should stream SRWZ2 instead
robots in half an hour?
I guess people mistook it for Midnight
HHNNNNNGGGG
TWITCHA TWICH
I still cant believe I won the lottery
/me ducks for cover as an anvil falls on Ziltoid's head
WHY DO YOU THIS
BECAUSE PONIES
9you did?
9tell me you chose something with giant rowboats
nope
Fail
I choose re-animator as b movie
/me grin slowly fades
What was our B movie last night again?
No rowboats?
...
Y u not choose flubber
NOPE
Lol because flubber is terrible
Re-animator is not
haha

/me is having a nerdgasm watching the customization options that will be included in the Space Marine Multiplayer. 1 BILLION variations of colors, model shapes and everything in between!!!
Hi RobotPinkie
Coolio
NewDCD, I heard something about TTGL: Gurren Hen a while back. What was it about?
Hi Pinkie_Pie
I need the watch the new dr who episode
NewDCD: I wet myself when Freedom showed up
9Dermathil: It will be streamed with Lagann Hen back-to-back on the day of the S2 Premiere
No disagreement there
>mfw people say the customizer for Space Marine looks better than the one in Halo: Reach (And WOOHOO!!!!! awesome NewDCD)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an2xkJrP3oI
I love this.
So much.
is there a video of the custonizer dermathil?
yes Ziltoid
Linky link?
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/trailers/3792-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine-Multiplayer-Customization
you can be a beaky
9also
9do you guys remember our little talk about mass-production mechs comissioned by Equestria?
I guess?
I do not, but I am interested
What pisses me off, there isn't a single opening for ACE:R that has audio left on Youtube
9I tried drawing one
9namely Lyra's unit (albeit she'd be in the Equestrian equivalent of a GM)
whatcha think of the customizer, Ziltoid?
9the mechs would be humanoid, but with a tweest: they have input modes for both pony and human pilots, and ponies can switch between both forms at will (since this is an universe in which travelling from world to world would change you to the dominant form/species of that world, albeit you can avoid this with the right equipment)
watching now dermathil
9in pony form, the magic in each of them is harnessed in the "Ether Engine", allowing for extra power/speed/ect, but much less maneuverability and handling
9due to the lack of digits, after all
9additionally unicorn-type units have an Amplifier Horn somewhere on the head part
Pony cursors!
NewDCD, godspeed writing that fanfic
9it can basically be used for GIGANTIC TELEPATHY
9"Watch in awe, as the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie levitates a Beam Rifle towards her unit!"
I like where this is going.
hello Cobb
I love when games allow you to make right left shoulders differnt
Hey Ziltoid, isn't it right that RobotPinkie had won the lottery but was afk?
Figures
yeah it was
OH HI ROBOTPINKIE
We are Bff now k?
so whatcha think of the customizer Ziltoid?
What lottery, though?
B-Movie
b movie
oh fuck
lol
the one I actually wanted to win, and the mods knew what I'd picked...
the customizer is pretty bamf
So who won instead?
Ziltoid
I did
:D
he chose re-animator
Ooooh, nice!
Then I don't really mind losing
was that your choice?
lol
Naw, my choice was The Last Dragon
ah
I still gotta win to make CUBE be put on the stream eventually.
I think it'd be an awesome movie for BMN
9brb
(Been trying to get it since night #3)
oh wow, that's kinda gory :P
eh
Cult movie is cult
Don't get me wrong, I approve
cube with matt smith?
/me goes back to nerdgasming over the Space Marine Customizer
I really hope not :P
nah, Ziltoid. I don't think so
Who wanted to pick a movie with matt smith in it?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/
Not sure, maybe Val?
man those choas space marines look so badass

/me is going to watch doctor who
Yep
ALLIS
WHY
U SEND ME DIS
Hai
I WIN
Neat, but how did you get it printed out?
Spiced wolf meat is best meat.
Cause I'm showing what you can do with that program
its a nice image
I created the PDF and went to the local Fedex/Kinko's and asked them to print them in high-quality laser paper for me
That poster cost me about $15
Did it not feel awkward asking them to print that out for you?
XD
haha, yeah, most people don't have printers that large, cost is mostly the paper and ink
(Funny story? The PDF was 800 megs long, it took their printer over an hour to print all 36 pages)
Nope, I don't hide my powerlevel
oh, that's a raster image?
I kinda want to do that with the comic con pony poster
was your power level over.....nvm
Yep! 6x6 letter-sized pages wide
hehe, I win again!
hey guys
will I never cease to reveal my nerder level?
Nevar
O pi
mmmmmm pie
I might have to get that comic-con poster printed out on a "Somewhat" larger scale.

You are so right
So many disturbing, disturbing videos to choose from.
I quickly recovered this from 413chan
But again I ask, what constitutes mature?
Rofl
Does gore constitute mature?
considering it's COMPLETELY inappropriate for minors, I would go with yes
You guys wanted disturbing?

If I had a MLP cake, I wouldnt be able to eat it
oh god! WE'VE CORRUPTED THE YOUTH
I would want to keep it
I would have to freeze it or something
I had a small cake and felt like shit because the girl I liked was a bitchwhore from hell
Ahh the memories!
Thor is actually a pretty cool game.It's made by WayFoward and SEGA.
I doubt I would have had the MANGRIT to watch MLP at 15

hey guys i gots a sitiation.. see my name MeteorVenture? well i normally go by chunkatuff but i haven't been for nearly all pony related things.. should i change back to my normal name? (cause i do want to keep a consistent name)
up to you bro
4Your decision
No problem Ghosties.Just stay away from "Don't be afraid of the Dark".
4Aye, got it
it's just that i've had this name now for 6-7 or so months now.. it's a bit far in
It's full of horror clichés and it thinks it's scary.
It's not.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPG8Co_9xo
its far in?
THATS WHAT SHE....nvm
IS STREAM UP
Pegacorn: the 2010 remake or the 1973 oriinal?
*original
The remake
I really don't know anything about the original.
Dermathil: stream ain't up for me
ok well thanks for the replies i guess i will probably just change it back.. besides this name is from that really old pony name generator that i'm not sure exists anymore

can you explain why my left foot is cold but my right one is warm
I have no idea how this is
NewDCD, seeing as how the show will probably air in the morning (saturday morning cartoon is what's being thought), will the streaming of the movies during that Saturday be after the episode?
i seriously loved that game.. played through it 3 times in succession just to do and see everything

So I'm working on an RPG game. My goal is for it to be AS RANDOM AS FUCKING POSSIBLE while still having a compelling story and likable characters.
I can't find that one Halle Berry movie.
If I get it to a testable point, would anyone like a demo? :0
You guys need to see this
that RPG better have ponies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qja_JqkVx0
and it better not be DURRRRGARRRR
herospirit, i'm always one for an RPG
The one where Halle has 3 split personalities; one of which is a racist old white woman
Shad: Not as the main part of the game, but I'll sneak some Ponies in ; ]
ValtheJean, seriously. come on, Mardek really is a great game. just because it's not free-form rpg doesn't mean it's bad.
herospirit throw in some some shipping and I'd play it
I'd play it if it has a good plot
lol Edwardnewgate, that's Bjornfot's game
EdwardNewgate: Normal shipping or Pony shipping?
:P
herospirit Doesn't matter
would it really be shipping if it's canon?
no, it's complete and utter shit silvermane
SilverMane has a point
glad to know you have such an unfair bias on a game you've never played

it has significant merit. It is probably the most highly lauded flash RPG i know of and has garnered Fighunter/psuedolonewolf the respect of legions of flash players
so, TBS, herospirit? like fire emblem?
Nah, like Old Final Fantasy style.
ah sweet. how are skills handled?
What merit silvermane? A highly lauded flash rpg is still a nicely decorated turd
Silver, Bjornfot's is solely shipping, I'm suggesting an rpg with shipping involed
Damnit Val,stop being bias towards things you don't like!
Mostly gotten from levels, a few from side quests and during the Storyline.
or whatever you call it
lol pegacorn
>Val implying the platform is an indicator of quality
in the terms of flash? it usually is
lol I know EdwardNewgate, i was just commenting... hoping bjornfot comes on soon and gives us an update. haven't seen him in a while
I have started an argument. RPG's are now on my list of things not to mention :P
lol
He was on on Friday, wasn't he?
better add Caramel to that list then, hero
Flash has made some amazing games and stories. If a game is good for the PS1, then flash can make a good game as well as it has the same strength
I have enraged Val the Impaler
now now, you're welcome to discuss RPGs, I'll just keep my highly refined tastes out since apparently some people wont listen to reason :P
lol
>reason
lol
reason is not jumping to hatred over something you haven't tried
RobotPinkie: eeyup
^
To each his own, really.
I have seen PLENTY of the game silvermane
plenty
I'm using RPGMakerVX for mine, so it's kind of hard to make it stand out.
I mean personally I love ponies, but I'm guessing I'm in the minority.
?
think your tastes are refined val? i haven't played a game i've liked in 16 years!
I love ponies...
RobotPinkie, i'm lost on your comment
that's not refined, that's just hermit-ism :P
I'm trying to use completely custom art and music to make my game a little different.
:O you too?
lols
omg
OH MY GOSH PINKIE, I like Ponies TOO!
>mfw i've been trolled. well played, good sir...
i'm jk though.. i really like some stuff.. i'm gonna try to get into dwarf fortress
I'm kinda kidding, though I mean the point is mostly that not everyone likes the same thing and it's not a big deal :P
I haven't found a PC game that I haven't quit yet
they're usually fun for a while but they get old
of course, just they're all wrong :P
Not intended as a troll, Silvermane, just a joke
ponies will NEVER get old
shad haven't you played any pony games?
Opie denied
Back again
Oh yeah Shad, then what about Granny Smith?
no i can't find any
D:
lololol
what about granny smith
<_<
true, but there is a difference between stating a personal liking or disliking of something, and saying something is good or bad. I can enjoy things that i know are bad, and hate things i know are good.
I think I'll try this Bullet Hell Pony game now :0
>ponies will NEVER get old
>granny smith
brb,gotta eat
I SEE WHAT U DID THER
equestria gaming = equestria daily.. for games
lololol
k
hmm, i wonder if any pony games have finished since i last looked
>mfw I've been running WoW simulations for the past half hour
I agree, Silvermane
break the curse Allis! free yourself from WoW's even taint!
I still can't wait for Fighting is Magic.
ya i wanna own some noobs
oh WoW... i remember WoW... 6 months of my life, and a lv 73 undead warlock later
Can't, not until the next expansion :(
their doing another expansion?
they're*
DO IT NAOUGH ALLIS
yeah
there's a game called dash off
Did you hear that Mane6 is gonna have a live stream of Fighting is Magic on the second? : D
if applejack had a game what would it be called
I heard it was going to be called "Tales of Pandaria" *barf*
TROLOLOL
I'll be honest, I miss WoW...I miss it a lot. But the best decision of my life was quitting it
I want to try WoW, but I'm a bit worried that it will take a long time to install

It had a couple good moments, but...
I'm back
lol hero you have my same unpopular opinion on some things it seems
RainBroDash Were you here yesterday during the twin towers?
It would seem XP
I think the gondor meme has to be preceded with the "It begins, the great shitstorm of our time"
10RobotPinkie yes all is great, busy though
10spazturtle eenope. I had to go to bed early, been travelling all day today, bloody knackered

how long was the trip?
@pony the Pony Gondor was with when all this happened
lol he's been dead since...like thursday
i liked WoW when i played it. i dislike how streamlined it has gotten, and i wouldn't play again, but i liked it back during the frist expansion
10ValtheJean well not too bad, about 6 and a half hours in total
ah

WITH A THOUSAND LIES AND A GOOD DISGUISE, HIT EM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, HIT EM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES
WHEN YOU WALK AWAY NOTHING MORE TO SAY, SEE THE LIGHTNING IN YOUR EYES, SEE EM RUNNING, FOR THEIR LIVES
i'm done
Shad knows this song really well. :P
what's that song called again?
I have a good memory :3
You're gonna go far kid
is the title.

ah, thank you
Anything for a Brony :0
Opie ghosties
so rainbrodash, you've been missed in story land
Still downloading XNA so I can play Pont TouHou :0
so guys.. that song "you're gonna go far kid".. we need a clean version with dance puppets dance!
clean?
ewwww
yes :|
dance brony dance...
I listen to stuff with a TON more cussing than that
i hate hearing it really.. but also lauren said dance puppets dance and it fits too well that it should be sung that way anyway
helloooo
Opie flutteryay
so*
on a pony related video anyway
so what's happening right now?
not much
I'm smashing my face against my desk trying to remember some of the bands I listen to

I let mah gaurd down. Ponies do that to you
and it's okay dermathil, I've got a few distractions atm :P
10well silvermane maybe at some point, trying to sort out some bronystate stuff and some uni stuff and some 'oh shit i have no money, just realised' stuff xD
HNNNNNG so much to do
sound horizon is awesome.. but japanese btw if it matters
...Also I should have known better than to even think of trying hard mode
OMG

DSNesmith c ya
Rainbrodash, in honor of your gallant efforts against the villainous sea ponies, I present to you my most sacred gift
If you gots an issue, here's a tissue! Also, i listen well. and apparently i talking like orc sisters now
Depending on how Season 2 goes, Princess Luna might be best pony...
^
I present to you, my most cherished trident: The Trident of Sea-Pony Smiting!
May you use it well against the vile sea-ponies
did you see the comic about how the fans will react to Luna's episode, RobotPinkie?
10is it +3 against hippocampus?
/me hands Rainbrodash the emerald encrusted trident
I prefer killing them with fire
eenop, +7
Nope Silvermane, link?
I'm 99% sure that I'll love the Luna ep, though :P
THERE'S A LUNA EP?
WHENNNNNNNNNNNN
10ValtheJean I like where this is going
just PUTTING luna in the show will make it awesome
and Shad, they confirmed luna will appear in S2
FUCK YEAH!
/me punches an orphan and kicks a cat
I'M READY
one of the animators basically said: "I can't spoil anything, but I've seen the luna episode and thought it was good"
7WAT
Thanks for knocking some sense into me RainbroDash
3They also confirmed there would be brony related stuff in S2
7stop kicking the cats!
k :(
and they confirmed that S2 will be SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
/me keeps refreshing the stream
Hey RainBroDash
When you kicked me, my computer froze
lol desertman2, they'll let us know when it's working again :P
And when it finally unfroze I had to clear my internet cache to get back in
so can I still punch orphans?
So now I have to log back in everywhere again
3Ouch
FUUUUU
3Y U SO EVIL RBD!?
10Pinkie_Pie I am truthfully sorry. Here is a miniature bouncing Ramona to ever keep you company: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101124124530/scottpilgrim/images/3/34/Ramona_victory-1-.gif
NOT THE ORPHANS!
I used to be an orphan
/me has read the "Ask Me Anything" by Jayson Thiessen. He has said there would be fun moments with Granny Smith
10I hope you will gratefully accept my token of apology xx<3
/me starts to punch robot but realizes he is no longer an orphan and stops halfway
quick! let's stop by an orphanage and hang a $50 bill by a string!
dat reference anyone?
lol, it's from Black Dynamite
who doesn't love luna
eenope robotpinkie
simpsons did it first :P
Should I know who Ramona is?
I demand a bouncing minecraft creeper instead
Good luck finding that
XD
10Silvermane I lol'd too hard.I thank you
lol Silvermane, dat comic
what's sad
is it is true...
you know that's exactly what's going to happen
They did "NOT THE ORPHANS!" first?
SOMEONE is going to get incredibly pissed off that their particular variation of luna fanon is not canon
wow, I missed that
fortunately i know almost all forms of Luna, so i can't be disappoint. unless they totally fuck with her and make her a blabbering idiot who does ballet or something
lol
I don't give a shit about anyone's Luna fanon, I'll be happy as long as she's consistent with what they presented in Season 1... which wasn't much
if she did ballet i'd still love her
luna is best pony
...
Shad, you know what, so would i.
I don't even care if she's any way related to any form of fanon, if she's a solid character I'll be fine
cuz she's so damn cute in socks. Fenrir and... oh my gosh, Flux is naked!
flux...?
Le flux
Someone's always going to be pissed, though.
acursed fanfic OCs....I don't know who they are but they annoy me already]
and I'll love and tolerate the shit out of that person robot
3That reminds me...
3I gotta get some artist to make me an OC
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
ValtheJean, it was a reference to a Luna art image. She had named her hooves whilst on the moon
>mfw Valthejean implies OCs are unilaterally bad
not you too Denied!
@Silvermane, ah
4Well
@Dermathil they are. period :P
3What? Is it bad to have a face?
4They can be bad
3I am not gonna write fan fiction with my own OC
She named one Fenrir, which had a sock on, and the other Flux, who didn't, and she exclaimed that Flux was naked
OCs are unilaterally OCs, and not canon. As long as people treat them as OCs, I'm fine with them.
gotcha
^
3Just have a face if you know what I mean
4Fun fact: I already have an OC
/me has a face
4From a few months ago
i jelly
@RobotPinkie: tell that to the Nyx crazies....
lol Nyx. i need to read that one still
@valthejean: depends on the writer's abilities. Some OCs can be good.
Well the Nyx crazies are... uh.... crazies...
not like she can compete with baby Midnight though. She's my fave oc
crazies are crazies
3*facehoof*
3Eeeup
@Dermathil: Well, since they all come from fanfics, I'm standing by my opinion
3Eeeyup*
3Hate it when my y key sticks
Nope.avi
I want to read that fic, but I'm busy reading an unrelated fanfic
Point being that "crazies" already implies that it's useless to try to tell them anything.
@valthejean: Fallout: Equestria would probably change that opinion of yours, but seeing how big it is and how much you have fics I don't see that happening.
oh Dermathil, you and FO:E
I'm half tempted to read it and prove you wrong
3OH GOD FO:E SHOULD BE A DAMN BOOK
but I'd rather not pollute my mind
ValtheJean, DO IT FOAL
3ITS JUST THAT GOOD
Rainbrodash, remove this laggy curse from my computer, or you will have horrible sea pony dreams.
DO IT FOAL
DO IT
Denied_Existance it IS a damned book
3Eeeyup
DUMB FABRIC
To everyone: Only fools don't change their minds.
DamnedBook, tell me a story
3Eeeeenope
okay.jpg
Nope.avi

@Dermathil: Only idiots change their mind without decent reasoning :P

Thank you Silvermane, some one had to do it.
lol, inb4 Shad
3WAIT, WHAT!?
not a problem Sumica, happy to be of service
3Explain RBD
and that someone thankfully wasn't me
10DamnedBook no u
I would have done it but I was still eating lunch.
what happened to your "_" interiorgummy? :P
I stole it
and ate it
GIVE IT BACK SHAD
OR IMMA IMPALE YOU
OMG MY LEFT FOOT IS COLD AGAIN
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU
@valthejean: you can try FO:E to see who is right, and if you don't change your mind I will respect it. But usually someone needs to see both sides of the medal to make the best decision possible.
/me silently removes the ice bucket from under Shad's foot
I read that as "gold"... Stay away from the Midas statue, dude
my left foot is gold
alright Dermathil, let's work out the ground rules then
FFFFFUUUUU
MOTHER FU READ IT
how much of this atrocity do I need to read before being allowed to lock it in a dungeon and never EVER read it again?
FOREVER er wait that dosent work with that
(In other words, how long do you think it will supposedly take to catch my interest)(
ALL of it
kthx
inb4 Val thinks FO:E is shit
inb4val pretends he thinks FO:E is shit but he actually loves it
lol, I wont say anything RobotPinkie....except you're most likely right :P
/me 10doesn't really like FO:E that much
/me is tired of the arguments on here. Some should stream something already.
lol Shad, inb4 I write a lengthy literary critique as to why FO:E is shit
10thanks for the input silvermane
10love it.
I'M BACK.
10WELCOME BACK
10:D
3Even if you don't like it RBD, you have to admit he writes it really well.
Soooo... Should I go play some more Time Crisis, or wait and see what Val thinks of FO:E?
you're welcome RainBroDash, it loves you too. wb Herospirit
THANK YOU.
Is it safe to link?
CAPITAL CAPITAL.
it's up to you, though I still don't have a rule on how much I have to actually read
10DamnedBook yeah, but a lot of people glorify it like it should be able to turn all people towards fanfiction in general :P
ValtheJean: did't you learn anything from Bridal gossip?
Decisions decisions...
10I just don't agree
3Well those people are stupid
So, I can beat Pony TouHou on normal mode. :0
Read the first 5 chapters, go do that without commenting until you are done, tell us your opinion (not what quality it is) and then stop talking about it. Sound fair?
@Sumica I'm not judging a book by it's cover, I'm saying by definition I hate fanfics. And with that being said I'm actually offering to read the monstrosity
3Just because a book is good, doesn't mean everyone should read it
my first fanfic was cupcakes, didn't really make me want to read more fanfics
Sumica: BRIDAL GOSSIP AHAHAAH I LOVED THAT ONE. Made me laugh and do the 'wtf am ireading' face several times
Though they only have 3 levels done though.
first 5 chapters? Fair enough. I can abide by this
my first fanfic was also cupcakes
Shad, same; but i read 'Swayback Mountain' shortly after, and (besides learning i like shipping) it fixed my fear of fanfic
10DamnedBook people do that though :P
but then I read Dangerous Business
I think Sumica means the Episode Sulvermane :0
Well, also you'll have to tell me what you think when I'm back in an hour, ValtheJean :P
can I get a link or something? or do I have to browse through EQD >.<
Silvermane*
...
I'll see you guys in a bit, I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists and their giant robots.
oh fuck, Bridal Gossip, i was thinking it was Bridal Black
http://youtu.be/ccTS6AtcxDo I hope Season 2's opening is something like this
herospirit, thanks for pointing out my mistake
i'm apparently hung over
Yah no prob. It's what I do
see ya later RobotPinkie
if only i had gotten drunk last night
peace Pinks
Silvermane is wasted like Twilight Sparkle.

It's perfect!

Welcome to Japan

Lol Japanese Pinky.
Uh
yfw Kenshin is also played by a woman
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRF9DLr6x28&feature=related
Naruto is also played by a woman
And a slew of other male characters are also played by women
let's just agree that all male leads are women in Japan
I cracked up on the noises Japanese Pinky made when she derped
japanese people are fucked up
Most prepubescent male characters are played by women va's
By which you mean awesome, Shad?
Dude, they have Takarazuka
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb61JsF0z7U&feature=related
super powerful man character manly man > have female with high voice for him

I believe men should play men women should play women unless the character calls for the other genders voice

Rainbow actually sounds very much like herself
And they do awesome things. Like Phoenix Wright Musicals

I did everything properly

celestia is so mean to luna
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erohefd2aeM&NR=1
Will the stream be here again or on the backup channel
[16:03:14] [irc.ytalk.co.cc]: *** CONNECT: Connecting to server: vegasbaby.irc.ytalk.co.cc (72.46.159.203:7777)
that happens, and then nothing happens after :"
:/
how could she do that to luna what a bitch
dunno riders, I'm just waiting for more info atm
If I get your servers dealt with would you mind if I put mumble on one of them?
wut is mumble?
Low bandwidth voice server
hmm
ok
so im gonna ask again, but this time pretend you are explaining it to a 5 year old
what is mumble?
Like multiplayer skype
i got some hot pockets
cool
how much bw?
Free
how much bandwidth *
Skype + IRC = mumble
Umm
Depends
less than 100GB/mo ?
Less than IRC prolly
oh
yeah, thats fine
Definitely
isn't skype already "multiplayer"?
Well
so you're mmmm a beyatch that likes hot-pockets?
just wondering which server you should put it on
if its not too much, stick it on my capped server which is closer to you

I use windows 7, because linux is crap for games, and Mac OS is for retards
:D
lol
So is Val now a huge fan of fanfics?
mfw this band's grunt-screamer singer is a woman... and has a deeper voice than me
Hahahahaha
lemme just copy and paste that to a friend that uses mac
awesome
/me hugs Curly too
Val is still reading and is contractually bound to say nothing further
I really cannot stand mac advocates
Ive missed Curly
indeed.
they're so damn expensive, and why?
he'll tell us later
they have terrible hardware compared to a similarly priced PC
OhIt'sTimeToClearMyKeyboardCuzSometingIsUnderMySpace
even one from a vendor rather than a selfbuild
I just took out 2 giant robots and saved the president, and then I got the trophy for finishing the first level.... is this awesome or not? I literally cannot tell.
Cat.........
:D
sup?
What are you PLAYING?
Did you really just say Macs are for retards?
first leveL? saved the pres?
[16:11:58] <+Cat> they're so damn expensive, and why?
[16:12:14] <+Cat> they have terrible hardware compared to a similarly priced PC
[16:12:24] <+Cat> even one from a vendor rather than a selfbuild

I cannot see any point whatsoever in macs
:)
That's too bad.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndI73gmYc4I&feature=related
Linux + $$$$ - freedom of use = Mac OS X
Yes indeedy, and it's Time Crisis: Razing Storm
plus the shiney-shiney!
never forget that!
Did you guys make sure to come up with a test to make sure Val did read it?
controls are a bit meh, but the shooting is great.
/me distracts Cat with a quarter
Not counting virtualization.
Beautiful suits. and now Everybrony is laughing at me
celestia had a good prank 1000 years ago
Sumica, i'm sure Dermathil can fact-check
everything, at a ridiculously high markup for not very impressive hardware
I can freely ald legally distribute the OS, can you do that with macs?
:D
uh panic?
uh?
WHATERITISABRONYISSUPPOSEDTOWALLOWIN
Cat: but shiney :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0fusx_9IaI&feature=related
Im happy wif Linux
^
I actually feel like doing a hackintosh in a virtual machine
oh laud male cupcake song
because my pc does virtualisation very well
wait, is that a voice shift or a re-sung version
I have a couple of linux ones already
re-sung
So can Val say how far along he is, or is he contractually forbidden from that too?
Re sung
and a windows 98 one for playing certain old games
And if Im happy with something then I dont like changing it ... I end up breaking stuff
I don't know, is he Silvermane? :P
VAL IS ALLOWED NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL
7Poor val
I think I've managed to break linux more thoroughly than I have windows so far
The reason I prefer OSX to a linux flavor is because I absolutely hate Linux GUIs (and yes, I know you can customize them to pluto and back) but they just suck.
7*hugs him*
RobotPinkie, agreement was no comments until finished, then a 'like it or lump it' opinion, but a status update is not restricted
GET BACK IN THE CAGE VAL.
GIVE HIM NOTHING, BUT TAKE FROM HIM, EVERYTHING!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzoAY2FyFCA&feature=related
indeed, poor Val :(
yay! Hugs!
but... free
D:
/me hugs Luna
And on top of that, the apps and menu intuitivity for mac apps is just stellar.
Val is allowed to say how far he is along. 3 months?
LUNA. DO NOT TOUCH THIS CREATURE
ubuntu 11.04 isnt too bad
Indeed, but you have to get hardware somewhere
just waay too slow
/me 7giggles happy
/me wishes he could get Luna hugs...
And I personally don't mind mine.
can i get a hug? :(
Val is half way through Chapter 2
ah alrighty
There's no need for more unless you game (or compile large projects)
/me 7Hugs the manechatroom
7there you go
I wish I could get Luna hugs too :(
can you actually replace every piece of hardware in a mac yet?
/me likes this plan
And if you game on a computer you're wasting your life anyways.
yay
Cat: not at all.
Cam: Or want a decent OS
integrated graphics cards suck.
:D Yay Luna hugs!
Don't start it again.
hehe
fine
the background singers sound so creepy in the deep voice
pretty much all entertainment is a waste of time if you get down to it
Luna better than celestia
Because I will absolutely SHIT on yo for running UBUNTU on a motherfucking server.
Cat: indeed ;)
I have a very decent pc because I do a computer science degree and need a fast computer for compiling stuff
Elusive's one was awesome
it just happens that that same hardware also runs games awesomely
Cat: then I would definitely recommend a computer customized for that.
so I might as well, eh?
if you dont wnat the server, I can just remove yer user ;)
The MacPro (not macbookpro) is perfect for compiling.
ubuntu is universal though
I like tha
no
:/
I suppose not
I'll copy my configs and leave if you'd like.
nah
the mac pro probably doesn't have a top of the range processor
not that mine is anymore either
Oh man I want to link to that Luna vid again...
Cat: It has an i7 afaik
still, a 3.4Ghz quad core is pretty good
That's not shabby :>
They went with those names for the rule63 versions?
I'm on amd
eww amd
apparently Sumica
shush, you
:3
(although i don't actually know them)
with 8GB DDR3 ram and an nvidia GTX460
not super-high spec, but still pretty nice
somehow I think if Twilight really were male, there would be much more Princess shipping not involving Luna
yeah, well I have a fucking hooker in my comp
so fuck you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwwvM4LKGg&feature=related
I first ranacross those names from one of the Fics, Cross and arrow.
I don't even want to think what it's like to clean up afterwards D:
i'm waiting for that to finish so i can read it all in one go
o.O
ok, time to go poop now
brb
soo
RobotPinkie, KILL IT WITH FIRE
.....
Sumica, what are the other Fanfics for it?
RobotPinkie you keep your god damn sea ponies to yourself!
Seaponies
stuff *
What? It's G4 fan art, and it's pretty good, too.
I dont know of any othere rule63 fics
Hippocampi are abominations
SEA PONIES ARE ABOMINATIONS
Sumica, there are a few, but that's the most famous
ahh
so I guess that would be why those names were used.
Sea ponies are best ponies, clearly.
RobotPinkie, troll harder. :D
/me wonders how val can read two things at once.
How long until showtime?
Okay Silvermane, if you really want to
/me loves RobotPinkie and his antics
because it's so hard to stop reading mid-sentence?
It really is a good pic though, Silvermane.
non-newtonian fluid!
ValtheJean = I thought My Little Pony was an abomination 10 months ago, yet here I am now.
:D
it meens you are not focusing val =p
also, I am now back from pooping
just to be clear
:|
I mean I really don't see why people have such an aversion to it, it seems rather... silly.
it is well drawn, but i can not be swayed by Dashfire that easilly
Sumica, have you been to university yet?
o.o
i dislike hippocampi for the sake of they creep me out, as do most sea creatures of the like.
I wouldn't mind seeing Seaponies revamped for G4
And indeed, Riders
I would
Cat: You have experience with linking IRC server?
I have no desire to see sea ponies in G4
Same here, I think the current MLP team would do it well.
Servers *
I have absolutely no idea when it comes to that
Only as a one-off though, probably
if they revamp it and make them less abomination-like, i could learn to accept them, but never like. too creepy
oh :/
why?
hurrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy
Cat: My servers wont link
GUYS. I KNOW WHO DISCORD IS.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXWNV2wGu4
uhh there is now cornstarch all over my air
HE IS THE SHMOOZE
But that's kind of my point, Silvermane, if they're done in G4 style then how are they abominations?
NOTHING CAN STOP HIM
shmooze...?
that sound...
I wouldn't want to see G1 sea ponies in G4, either. :P
it hurts my soul
That would be the scariest thing of all time.
herospirit, my soul hurts from that sound
Unless the Smooze is a Doctor Who Eldridge abomination, I want nothing to do with it
anons gonna anon
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT
it could be worse, you could have had wood dust in your eyes like me a couple days ago
RobotPinkie, horses are not meant to not have legs. that is why. i'm just gonna sit here
that really hurt
o.o
I actually wrote a few paragraphs of Grimdarkness about the smooze.
For shits and giggles.
how?
Horses aren't meant to have wings, either. :P
me and dad were shoveling up some leftover wood pellets from his work to take home and use as bedding for the horses
Posted it in the pony thread on the MSPA forums. :p
yes, but those are more natural from mythology
it was in a big pile and we were shovelling it into the trailer
about 2 tonnes in all
When someone else posted the smooze video. :0
But... mythological sea horses...
:O YOU HAVE HORSES?
and we had masks on to avoid breathing it in, but it still went in my eyes
there is no mythology involving sea ponies essentially. They're just a stupid twist of mermaids and sea horses
:O YOU HAVE HORSES?
yes
D:
http://ytalk.co.cc/other
look at my picc
well, one horse and one pony
Something bad is coming down, have you heard the news?
NOTHING CAN STOP. THE SMOOZE.
^^
are you 12?

I'm not keen on horses, myself

Well, that's fine, Silvermane. I don't really expect everyone to like the idea, I just think the hatred of sea ponies is mostly just a silly meme.

My head canon says Dashite always wields a Large Trout type weapon
I dun have flash
or a soundcard
:<
And Silvermane, what am I watching :0
3Well your a good artist, and thats way more than I can say
is your pc made of cardboard and bits of string?
it also has a powersupply
:D
and a pretend button made of a candy container
I don't know how some people cope
Im upgrading
wednesday
I was given this comp for free
herospirit, that's a bunch of FF and KH and some fighting game characters
is the upcoming pc utterly awesome?
or just better
dancing/singing a Korean pop song, performed by 9 women with that routine
Herospirit http://i.imgur.com/7nw7O.jpg
pretty awesome
5^lold
Hahaha
from the creator of Dead Fantasy series, using his engine as he was bored a few years back
Nvida 9xxx GE Gfx card
750GB HDD
6GB RAM
Rainbow Trout
isn't the 9000 series like, really old?
O-O
Cannot unsee
it's funny
Rainbow Trout was the first fish I ever caught
nooo
its new
but they moved onto 3-digit numbers a fair few years ago
also GE does not sound like a good combination of letters to me
like GS, misleading
but what do I know, I guess

3Hmmm....I still need to find somebody to draw me up an OC
5i can qeue you in this week
5queue
5*
it's from 2008, apparently
3Orly? Well I'd better work on a description or something...
and can be had in a whole load of stores for like, £62
3Danke Shöne
I paid $75
my OC is awesome, eh does magic and isn't afraid of anything
~$100 is a fair price to get it
it looks like my graphics card, except mine takes up two slots instead of one
I am also getting a sound card
and a new mobo
and mine was £146
3>Shameless self promotion
so basically, the only thing I am not changing in the box
are sound cards worth it these days?
what cpu are you getting?
5Denied_Existence: no worries, practicing makes me better
ValtheJean = So would you say your horse is amazing?
3Well my OC is flawed ValtheJean, just like the characters we love so much.
indeed
3So bleh
sorry Denied, I just really despise OCs
among other things :P
Hello pnies
Look at my OC, my OC's amazing. Give it a lick!
3Yeah...SURE you do.
Hello Ziltoid
It tatses just like raisins
Intel duo
Its all gonna cost $400
incl shippig
hmm
3NO, IT TASTES LIKE CUPCAKES
shipping
not too bad I guess
not bad
yeah
3Wait....
3OH GOD
are you gonna carry on running linux?
/me 3vomits!
With a stroke of its mane, it turns into a plane
O_o
like maybe 20% cheaper than ebay proce
price
and yeah
I will
*spits out his drink*
ZOMG
PLEASE LET IT BE TRUE
And then it turns back again when tug on its winkeh
/me 5catches ValtheJean drink in another glass
O-O
Delicious cupcakes.
5*sips*
any particular reason?
TO EQ
O_o
I likeit
<whining> I want a tablet! </whining>
that was in my MOUTH Wrek!
you think I should use windows?
3.....
5idubidubly
you just like...indirectly kissed me
I want an everything :(
3Ew.....
If I would use windows, I would use XP
I guess I can't tell you what to do
what do you suggest?
3WELP, GOOD THING I AM A WRITER
Windows XP feels crumbly and archaic when I have to use it nowadays
.
3ACTIVATE Wrek X ValtheJean
Windows 7 x64 is very nice
oh god
OH NO
NOOOOOOOOOO!
GOGOGO!
YES
I've used linux before
/me 3opens a word doc.
Oh YES!
what OS ?
Ship everything
distro *
DEAR GOD NO! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SHIPPED BEFORE
How scandalous
um, Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian and Mint
MUST.....WASH OUT......FILTHINESS
:/
5Denied_Existence: use google docs
the horror
I mainly just really cannot stand having to use the terminal
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-see-ponies-everywhere.jpg
hai guys
I knew I should have just stayed as a lurker >.<
3Wrek, I use word to prewrite
lol
thats the best part!
did any of you tell spikes secret?
D:
Try ubuntu 11.04
hello decappony
but it means you have to remember commands and shit
its changed a LOT
i didi
lolol DecapPony
http://i1127.photobucket.com/albums/l625/Phoenix_Lord1010/Pinkie%20Pie/CreepyPinkieForever.png
Spike has a secret?
I have ubuntu 11.04 on a virtual machine on my pc
dat ragecomic
hello :P
it's ok
the new UI is weird
yeah
Its too much of a resource hog though
ScaryPie_from_the_Moon:Dear god.
hai creepy pinkie pie, want a hug?
what i tell you FOOREEEVERRRR WILL THIS HAUNT YOU
maybe it would be better with tweaking, but I don't have much love for linux because I cannot really play games on it
running a virtual machine or using wine does not count
yes
i think its funny
....k
but as you can see im still on the moon
3Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
say hi to luna's mechanical dolphin for me
Don't get me wrong, I would absolutely use Linux for running a server machine
but I don't think it's a great choice for a personal entertainment machine
3TO THE MOON'S MOON
moonception?
it's also pretty great for smartphones in the form of Android
I want to be mooned by Luna
yeah
/me moons RobotPinkie. "CLOSE ENOUGH"
but then again, I dont game much
3......
....ohwait
NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I play minecraft, but that runs on here in native java
ok i ish sowwy
robopinke is just thinking "dat plot"
you'd probably game more if you had a pc capable of a decent amount of gaming :P
see im good now wont be scary anymore
3DecapPony I actually don't doubt that
Well, there must be some reason everyone ships with Silvermane...
5._-
3Sorry, I don't ship with silver
I mean, the amount of super-cheap sales Steam do is mad
3It just doesn't existe
I used windows 7 before
i ish sowwy i scare u
that scared people?
hey! If I'm getting shipped against my will I demand Denied be shipped with silvermane!
and they're doing the anti-piracy thing well because they're making getting and playing the game far more convenient than it is for the pirates
evidently decap
basically the opposite of what those idiots at Ubisoft are doing
3Well thats cause I am writing it Val.
now im nice scarypie tho
3And because you did something to warrant it
Back!
hello!
you at home?
would you like a cupcake?
3Nah.
its just chocolate
3Moon cupcakes taste too dusty
i want one
wait...what I do to warrant it!
Wrek was the one who stole my germs!
mhmm
3Er...welll it wasn't you
*eats cupcake and hands decap one*

Posted that pic.
3Sathi doesn't want that stuff today
i was helping him stay up
I just see a white square
I see
sathi is here?
You gotsa click it.
:0
3Luna is Sathi
White squares are scary.
Wouldnt recommend clicking it
thats was just my drivers license
No, I saw the URL
is it because sathi is on the moon?
3So...Wrek, what gender do you want ValtheJean to be?
It's not really all that scary /:I
you guys hurt my feelings
3Sathi said no, so I say no
Should I play Silent Hill 2 or Just Cause 2?
4Silent Hill 2
I guess I'm the one person in the world who doesn't think deflated hair Pinkie Pie is a psycho killer.
just cause 2 is pretty good
your supposed to love and tolerate everyone
Darn..
Silent Hill 2
I still havent gotten past the apartment
no matter how disturbing and pshycho i look
i couldnt play silent hill 2
Nor have I found the flashlight
/me is fansquealing for the random gift he just recieved
3ANSWER ME WREK OR I START RANDOMIZING STUFF
is it Metro 2033?
RobotPinkie, depends on how psycho she is
What kind of gift Dermathil?
well im nice psycho right now
<----
im just a sociopath
She isn't psycho on the show though, Silvermane, or what do you mean?
5>implyign that Denied_Existence should randomize stuff
Hey everyponyt
there's a backup stream up
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateAlternative
/me takes a sociopath
everyponyta?
feel free to tune in if you'd like
we know
anyone wanna see my family photo?
Pinkie_Pie: I just got gifted METRO 2033 on steam by another brony!!!!!
Ghostie
4Yes, Pinkie?
Do I really have to play SH2?
been trying to get that hand for months now!!!
Im running around in the dark on it
Without a flashlight
They should of made Metro more of a free roam type game
4No. I just suggested it, you don't have to play it
No health drinks
No hope
RobotPinkie, she is implied to be going unhinged during that scene, and it may have degraded further, but it didn't. but then fanfics make it funnier/worse so who knows
Dermathil, that was nice of them
But Metro 2033 is stressful
Running around trying to keep from suffocating
Stalker is even more so
indeed it was, Pinkie_Pie. Got 30 hours in STALKER, loving the atmosphere. I actually wanted to play Metro instead of STALKER originally
Now DANCE FUCKER DANCE, he never had chance. And no one even knew, it was really only you! So DANCE FUCKER DANCE, I never had a chance, It was really only you... WITH A THOUSAND LIES, AND A GOOD DISGUISE, hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes, When you walk away, nothing more to say, See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em runnin...
with all of those anomilies, mutants, bandits, and radiation, bleed effects, etc
That song is STILL in my head.
Blarglarglarg
Herospirit Offspring rulez
its cause its an epic song
due to some mechanics with some of the monsters (I heard of a monster that don't attack if you don't look at it?)
Yeah unhinged, sure, but not full blown psycho. I know what the fanfics have made it into, but well... I don't think fanfics are canon. :P
3!nicks
my internet provider got pissed cause i torrented stuff
3DAMN YOU DARIBOT
3Y U NO WORK!?
Is it just me or is the stream a bit quiet?
Fanfics are never canon. They are a good read, but if there is one thing they aren't, it is canon.
seems fine to me
wait in metro or stalker dermathil?
Yeah it's a bit quiet for me too, Riders
Cupcakes is canon and you know it. Dashies number just hasnt come up yet
Yeah right.
Abacus is canon
cause i rememver monster like that from Metro i think
Rainbow Factory is canon
Anyone know how to get synchtube to work?
Caramel being Alpha is canon
anyone wants my cupcakes
cause it won't even load the homepage for me
Cameras are canon
take them or i'll get angry
or Canon, rather
abacus is the best pwnie ever
you wouldnt like me when im angry

Cuz fillyfooling is awesome
Why NOT
DecapPony: I heard of a monster that didn't attack when not looking in Metro. (srry for the late reply)
Ponies are like the Gerudo from Legend of Zelda
DecapPony: Well.. I dont know what to say man.. I mean.. Coincidence?

Taking a shower naked? Wow! I have never though of that!
Okay. Cutiemark Crusaders Carpenters!

/me begins to dust inside of hole
Im with Val, without ponies I probably wouldnt be sane.

/me 7loves this song

I have something to look forward to, and its in 19 days.

4...do you lads think it would be fun for this old wizard to buy The Sims 3 through Steam?
/me sings with Sotha
yes it would
/me sings with Amino AND Sotha
@Gandalf_The_White honestly, meh. The game isn't even that fun without the expansions
Buy? an EA product?
Depends on how much you like sims
/me 11loves The Sims, but that's because his own life is too dull to care about. :P
The sims is bad and you should feel bad
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/630.gif
Haha that Fluttershy Gif
6Guys, for those of you on dinkypage, if you refresh your page, the stream should be working now.

Heyho pony people.

HAI MOLLESTIA PIC!
6Lies.
6It's online.
/me sends Zubats at Meanwhile
nah
4And yes, Sumica. "BUY" an EA product. Sure, their marketing attempts are a bit rubbish, and they occasionally produce bad titles
@Ghosties(becauseIdon'twanttospelloutGandalf_The_WhitewhichisironicbecauseIjustdidandnowwastedspace) if you like it and are willing to feed the massive whore that is EA, go ahead
6Reload your PAGE, I said. Not the stream.

Gandalf_The_White it's an ok product but Will Wright has't worked on anything sence Spore.
