Hi Rainbrodash
Whoa, get ready for Bronydom to go from being invitation-only to turning into a mix-match of posers and fags
10but his fans are pretty obsessive :p
10^
like yourself?
10do ho ho
I invited myself in!
10I karate kicked the door down
I snuck in the back when nopony was looking
I exploded the door and ran in.
I moved in with a whole batallion of tanks.
10I think the thing that broke the back of my resistance (after a few weeks of just not caring at all :P) was the MLP physics presentation
10I -then- went fuck it I'll give the first episode a go, but I was in too good a mood to dislike anything that day, so it was already pretty decided :P
I had been so busy since the time MLP debuted till actually stumbling on it a few weeks ago that I missed it entirely
>implying the show can be disliked xD
I liked the first two episodes, but when I caught myself singing the theme song in my head, I knew
haha
7more TT?

I'm indifferent as not watching with sound, so i'll let others choose

wait, "we're really not [suppose to stream movies]"?
6Outside of the stream days we're not, GGgala
Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba.
0ugh
ohai guise
6To prevent the showing of movies that may be shown in the near future for all we know.
0what's wrong with streaming movies that aren't movienight movies during week?
ohai RobotPinkie
0ohey timezone buddy ^_^
Sprinkles answers the question before it's asked.
LAwl
okay, so we can stream movies that have /already/ been movie night showings?
Lawl.*
Not really.
6NO
6We have a STRICT 6 month wait on that.
exept if its spider web
I mean I restreamed Spider's Web.
6And that's JUST to get it picked in the lotto again.
trololol
6Yeah, and you got yelled at for it.
7spiders web...
No I didn't.
I was congratulated.
:P
hey Pegacorn, Daz
6>>;
Lord SUCKS.
/me 7hides under a rock
6I was told you were yelled at.
0ohai RobotPinkie
Oh man
So what's streaming?
0RobotPinkie: the aristocats
I doubt it's going to be chosen again anyway.
Oh I remember that movie, I loved it as a kid
I will pick it again
trololol
watched it in another language though :P
Lol
6I don't really care. It's just a rule.
6Honestly I was going to bring it up later, but for now, rules be rules.
0RobotPinkie: i know dat feel
Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba is the best name ever.
right, so since we have a six month wait on movies being shown again on BMN, then that means that we /won't/ see it "in the near future", so what's the problem?
6GGgala, we're trying not to show the same movie a million times.
The point of the 6 months is that we haven't seen the film for quite a while.
6And, we haven't watched this yet, so that IS a problem.
0following your logic, SirSprinkles, of not wanting to see a movie 2 times in a row, we're not gonna stream midweek a movei we saw at BMN thou are we
alla snubbar vill ju vara katt!
6The point of the 6 months is so we don't get the same movie in the lotto a BILLION times.
omg
So...
About that Wickerman
dat casual racism
6Daz, everything needs talked over.
...and the middle of the week isn't the lotto?
How much time left in this?
6Ziltoid, I'm not telling you and neither are ANY of the other mods.
it's the whim of the streamer
Awwwww
0'everything needs talked over' i don't understand.
6The middle of the week is pretty much whatever.
6And Daz, reshowing movies mid-week I have no personal issue with, but it's currently against our rules.
0Well ok then.
6No one mod makes the rules, so I can't just say "go ahead and do what you want"
so how about streaming movies that aren't allowed on regular movie nights?
6>movies unallowed
>aren't allowed
6...like?
Wut?
Porn
7>mfw
...
6...we watched The Room.
wut
6Close enough.
were these in the new rules image? i don't remember that
6No, GG.
6It's mod rules.
6Set in place on the mods for restriction purpoises.
like obscure foreign films that you'd clearly veto on a regular BMN
That's what RainBro's choosing.
7man the chances of winning the lottery are so random :P
6We don't just veto things based on that.
An obscure foreign film.
So...
0mfg ghosties and the lottery
0hahaha
0mfw *
7I never won
6If it's A or B and picked for A or B, we'll allow it.
That's not something we won't stream.
7never ever ever!
Okay, so you'd allow a 4 hour long Bollywood movie for BMN?
6And ANY movie will fall into one of those categories.
anons and mods always win
6Yes, Robot.
0sathi - i never won either and i've been here lots too u no !
7good to no :P
Okay, guess I got my A-movie pick :P
what
6Depends on if it qualifies as A.
I am very scared rb
6It might be B by our standards.
0what's yours RobotPinkie ?
Bollywood as A? O_o wut
0i just heard 'puddi'
Oh god
Um, unless you count all indian movies as B, I doubt it :P
6>still hasn't said what it is
6I could give you a ruling right now
0>i asked and everything
Rang De Basanti
The song for applejack's stage in Fighting is Magic is ballin
Eeyup
8.3 on IMDB, brilliant movie
6A movie
0"Critics gave the film an overwhelmingly positive response, in particular the ensemble cast's performance and credibility. "
if that's a B movie, then all foreign movies are B movies, essentially... :P
6I just said it was A. >>;

/me 10knows what's written on the homepage of the site he is an active moderator of.
inb4 Cursed Comic-OH I DUN SPOILED
Whatever, but I think it's unfair for our cousins who can't make it to the 7 PM EST stream
IS YOUR MIND READY FOR AWESOMENESS EVERYPONY?
10I won't be able to make them all dude, but it's also unfair to request our streamers to stream 10 hours of content per day for 3 days straight, surely?
That is true
IT'S MORPHIN' TIME!
I wonder if they're available on one of those movie stream websites?
Kids show? Yeah, lol, what a loser.

10yeah I guessed so much :P
10I quit after ICC
10But then my friend convinced me to come back to PvP with him for the summer, so I did
Urgh, I had to raid ICC for 11 months
Two nights a week
That just broke my spirit completely
10hah. I raided it for the first few months
I quit a couple of weeks after the Argent Tournament started in Northrend.
That's all I remember, sometime before LC instance
LK, lol
10Uldu was my favourite raid
10no question
Yeah, Ulduar was probably one of the best raids in the game
If not the best
10After that, Blizz just stopped caring about proper raiders :P
Ahhh, too much WoWspeak.
I can't even remember what my favorite raid is called :(
/me hides in the curve of the room.
After that they just made everything a toggle between normal and hard mode
10>mfw they released the patch notes for the ToTC raid, and I realise that noobs can get my t8.5 gear from HEROIC EMBLEMS. That's when I realised raiding was dead.
/me 10is a horrible elitist ;__;

my brain is full of WoW
/me 10gambled that it's nerimon, anyway, now checking EqD
10dari cause you're not a youtube whore
10simplez
5naptiem, then moar artmkaing
10yeah, called it
Welp, you were right.
10Also you'd love him, he absolutely bums Doctor Who
Why he is so popular then? O_o
10he was in a band where they made dr who inspired music
mfw when I was three weeks ahead of when ponies became poplar
10he's also a bit of an oldschooler I guess, he was one of the pioneers of the introduction of VLogs into youtube
This is strange.
O_o
XD
10and he's pretty funny I guess :P
wow, it's like watching a brony conversion almost in real time...
10oh, one of his most popular series of videos
10was he read twilight, and filmed himself reading it
10and talked about it, and took the piss out of it, I guess
oh god no
so my 16 gig went straight to the recycle bin
OH GOD NO

The only Twilight is Twilight Sparkle
Lol what the hell.
LOL
Already wants a Fluttershy toy.
Wow.
10So good
10also, inb4 charlieissocoollike posts a video about ponies
10after this video gets a surprisingly large number of views
Oh God no, not that guy.
charlie who now?
10Ahh so you know charlie?
My sister told me about him I think.
10Charlie and Nerimon are buddies, roomies
10they've been like co-youtubers (with seperate channels) for a long time, charlie got popular after his how to be British and 'How to be British: Extreme' videos were mentioned on like GMTV and shit lol
>"Pinkie Pie is annoying. I want to to just, like, sleep with her so she'll be quiet."
Comment on the pony reaction vid "I love community. I started watching it when Charlie﻿ tweeted that he watches it. And I'm done watching them all already."
10and then soon after, nerimon was making videos too
10I told you, obsessed fans ;)
Presumably Charlie is something big in the UK?
>Does it look orange to you
or Youtube big, at least...
I BETTER NOT TURN OUT GINGER!
XD
10charlie's not -that- big, he pales in comparison to like sxephil and stuff
Never heard of him.
10but yeah, in the UK he was on early morning TV and stuff
Okay...
ugh, sxephil
10dari, you know nothing of youtube, go die
Youtube sucks.
10meh
:P
Especially all the people on it.
Youtube is great, you should watch the pony vids on there
10I've been with it since the beginning, it's the easiest way to get SC2 videos and shit all in one place
No, youtube is 100% troll.
10at least, that's one of the main reasons I still use it
@trollsmeter YouTube
6 YouTube is 89% trolls. (138)
Like there's this vid of Rainbow Dash, and it has really sexy music playing
@corporate_slavemeter YouTube
6 YouTube is 80% corporate_slave. (139)
I came exactly 7 times while watching it.
10just saying, that's who you aren't familiar with :P
Meh.
10only 7 robotpinkie?
10jeez
Well that's the first time through
and that's while I was also doing dishes, btw
These types of videos don't interest me.
They're just normal people, why should I give a shit about what they do.
But yeah, video comments on Youtube....
I have my own life to do normal shit in.
10You shouldn't
Makes me fear for the sanity of the human race....
10but if it's -entertaining- then you can choose to watch it for entertainment
10oh, dari, you so silly
You mean the retarded meme comments or the argument comments?
hey what did I miss?
I'm sure those retarded meme comments are chan people.
OH man thast reminds
me
Well, both, though mostly the latter...
anyone see the 4chan referance in deux ex?
Nope. Don't go on chans.
Nope.
Haven't been to 4chan since... approximately the dawn of time
Sathi's asleep, post ponies!

You're very welcome
10what's up ret?
Afraid of moths.
What the hell is with that.
lol hai ReticentSmolder, and shoot
10what of it?
This guy is afraid of moths too.
anywho, I was wondering who usually does the streams at night with Dr. Who and if they're on
The Charlie guy.
10I FUCKING TOLD YOU
Why are people so scared of moths?
10THEY'RE SCARY
What the fuck.
Oh, and he's scared of My Little Pony.
10...
moths are liked the evil twisted cousins of butterflies
10EXACTLY
who you talking about dari?
Moths are cute.
10NO
NO
Fluffy.
And nice.
Like bees.
NOT THE BEES
He's talking about Charlie, I guess?
Who is charlie?
I hate moths
Bees just wanna see what vidya you're playing tho
Charlie the unicorn?
10Bees are great
some British guy on Youtube
10Bees are fucking nice
well, I was wondering when dari usually streams
Well tarantulas are cute.
10moths want to fucking kill you
...
Moths.
Are awesome.
GTFO
10NO U
yeah, I just finished watching Nerimon's reaction to MLP
What kind of idiot is scared of a moth?
:P
10<-
OI, DARI
prince-parasprite
I just throw them outside.
So they don't die in our lights.
Smolder's asking you things :P
Poor moths.
So
Sorry*
YeaH?
so when do you usually start streaming?
It's sort of random.

This guy?
(and moths are delicious, I hear)
Usually it's late.
Well, late my time.
because like Ziltoid, I just saw that vid...and its pretty cool
10yeah reticentsmolder we've been talking about it for a while
like 4-5 EST or later, I think... I haven't been here for that many dari streams though
first hand brony conversion
and...I've been hankerin for some pony
I can stream now I suppose.
/me 10needs food
10I'll be back in a while
well, I was just wondering if you normally stream at certain times because of work or other stuff
Should be time for an episode of something before Sathi comes back.
an episode of That Mitchell & Webb look? :P
7@Dari you have till 4 PM Eastern :P
Meh.
Gunna go for a shower.
I'd just like to mention...#BronyState is probably the best chat room I've ever been in...ever
so much so that I'm pondering putting us into a fanfic
Because ponies
just for shits and giggles
What how would you do that?
I...don't...really know but it would be awesome
I was planning on ponifying the major personalities in chat, from mods to regulars
Make a fanfic where Bronystate is a competing force to CmC :)
and depict them in Equestria, meeting at a movie theatre every Friday
like Ghosties would be laughing it up, SilveScreen would man the projector, Hipster_Brony would probably act as a bouncer, Bjornfot would be yelling the same thing maniacally in a corner, I'd be writing, Silver would have a gaggle of guys around him, etc.
That reminds me, we have a weather forecasting model abbreviated CMC.
That actually sounds pretty cool, Smolder
it would be kind of like fight club...but nopony fights
I explode.
like a bootlegging community of Bronies who like watching movies in secret away from the prying eyes of filly-dominant pony society :D
The first rule of BMN is... everypony came.
the second? first rule but applied to SilverMane
/me violates Rule 1.
lol
and lol...get this
the bronies would watch episodes of Friends...
or some human sitcom
Hah, I'd vote for that
Haha, cartoon ponies watching live action humans, that's perfect
Lol.
tell me if you think the idea is stupid or not, because I'm seriously debating making it my next fic
I'd read it, I think it sounds funny
the obly problem is getting everypony's personalities and appearances down
Hmmm, yeah, that could be a lot of work.
in which case I'd have to get an appearance and brief bio on ppl that would want in on it
Yep.
10ReticentSmolder that sounds like it has promise XD
10I dunno what perspective you'd write it from
10like, 1st person or 3rd, and if 1st person, then whose perspective?
could work like this: use the pony creator to give me a pic, then write a bio about yourself and your cutiemark/occupation and how you fit in BronyState, then email that shiz to me
it would have to be from 3rd, to avoid my natural bias
I'd vote for either 3rd person or ReticentSmolder's perspective.
well, if it was my perspective I'd probably be sitting in the corner writing down random stuff on a notepad :D
lol, I guess 3rd then :P
I guess it would be kind of a satire on the brony community, ours specifically

agreed
10dariiii you streaming anything good?
That fail is mind-blowing...
nothing streaming
oh wait
something streaming
think of just how much 100 or 1000 idiots can do. most recently, think the london riots / uk riots. Now think about this : 7 billion.
Well, not all 7 billion people of earth are huge idiots...
Think about how stupid the average person is.
thank goodness for that, RobotPinkie, but i point you to AllisZero's comment
Now realize that half the population is stupider than that.
and some of the other half is still only that
Yeah I've heard it before :P
Although
example from not 2 hours ago:
I'm nowadays more inclined to believe that ignorance truly is bliss
I just don't buy it. I mean global riots? I could see that happening, given the right circumstances.
i was watching riddick with my father, and in english, and he keeps telling me some scenes aren't in the spanish version. mfw it's on same dvd. mfw it's just an audio change. mffw
lolol Daz
Lol
Haha
spanish education is just eh. erryone so stupid
actually:
example from 20 mins ago (i was at cornershop)
10dman implying britain isn't horribly dumb too XD
Every country is horribly dumb, but there's a difference between crowds and individuals.
I askked how much that pack of 2 drinks were. man said this: 'it's 3 euros for both, but if you only have one it's 1.79. so basically if you want one it's 1.79, but for two it's 3 euros like 1.50 each, but one is actually 1.79, and two are 3 euros'
i promise you this just happened 20 mins ago
Well
with his ridiculous spanish accent, mispronouncing about half the alphabet
i guess so RainBroDash, i guess that's true.
No, he's giving you a discount of .29 for buying more than one
See here's the thing though
I generally like people, just not people when they're in crowds...
hahaha AllisZero
also: they were a 2pack, so both in same wrap
About 50% unpacked
I hear a chair squeaking and a printer printing
A drink will cost you 2.29
Buy two for only $5!
well, i'm sure we can agree that in most places people are idiots
And they get away with it.
[18:12] <RainBroDash> dariiii you streaming anything good?
Nah
I'm leaving.
10kk
AllisZero, epic darp by buyer
later dari
Bye.
good luck in Town
well shucks, what morons the buyers are
eeyup
Ones that don't pay attention to prices at least.
My favorite special price was in a small corner shop, "buy 2 for the price of 3"
Well, the entire human population is pretty much being educated to be an average consumer
I didn't take them up on the offer, though.
oh lol, RobotPinkie
AllisZero, indeed
actually, I have a quote
"ou are not your bank account, you are not the clothes you wear you are not the contents of your wallet you are not your bowel cancer you are not your grande latte you are not the car you drive you are not your fucking khakis"
Pretty much
(a khakis is a military uniform made of khaki fabric)
from the same song: "deliver me from swedish furniture"
lol ikea
Lol
Isn't that from Fight Club, though?
I saw a comic the other day, Ikea Job Interview
welp seeing as nothing's streaming want link? Yes it is RobotPinkie, but it's a song with many quotes in this one song
Boss is sitting on his chair and the person being interviewed is presented with a screwdriver and a disassembled chair
I found that was funny
I love the intro too. it basically sticks a middle finger up at psychological therapies, which in my opinion are a) utter bull and b) only work on those who want it to work for them who also are idiots.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpqObhK4Rw
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Fight Club - This Is Your Life" - "awesommeee, just had the urge to upload this, fantastic... just listen!"
lol I like IKEA
Hey, i have a lot of ikea furniture
So do I
it's probably the best place to get furniture
but i wouldn't buy something because it 'looks cool.' in fact, my house is pretty bare of furniture
heck, my room has no wardrobe! i have a bed and a desk. that is all
Well, no.
(i can upload pics if u want)
but I don't really mind if people get stuff that looks cool, hehe
and yet i have a projector and bowers&wilkins speakers in my lounge, with a dropdown screen thing. So yea, RobotPinkie cool stuff is, well, cool :3.
Well, yes
I have 8 ponies right here, they're pretty cool!
>8
You didn't tell me this!
i must know!
But if you're getting cool stuff not because you like cool stuff but because you want to feed your ego...
which ones you have now? :P
Then I hate your guts
AllisZero, i concur.
Oh I'm counting the molded ones, Daz
ah. well then, carry on.
So Pinkie and Twi show up twice
I haven't yet done any hair : /. and i know RobotPinkie i have the pics saved
Might get more next month :P
I heard that we'll like... officially start switching to G4 then, here
presumably because S1 premieres in Swedish soon...
i hope so too. hey got any idea for your dub times?
i mean, s02 is 17th sept, and in spain i still dunno when / where to watch dub for s01
Me neither, I'm pretty sure it's gonna air on Cartoon Network here
i'm in spain ;__;
o wait
which is good, it has an english language track on DTV
in north of spain there's cartoon network, but below madrid there's no cartoon network
and i'm south spain. sigh. i hope it's either available here somechannelelse, or it's uploaded to the interwebs
I might do Pinkie's hair today, btw. I'm switching my plan for how to treat it
what's your new plan? I need to know for mine :3
Going to split it up into 6-8 times as many curls as the guide suggests :P
where is our interviewee?
lol I dunno if it's a GOOD plan, though
i'll await your results ^_^
also: i've got something planned for Daisy Dreams, as her hairstyle isn't actually a colourswap
but yeah, the 3 curl plan didn't work for me... at all
and for some reason, probably cuz i own her :3, i've gotten mad at people who called her a reskin >_< she's got totally different hair
well try the new plan then
haha :D
I hope they include the extra G4 brushables as background ponies in S2
...:O!!!!
i just imagined my room with every inch covered in UNIQUE ponies :3
it was glorious
I think Hasbro has asked for that, but I dunno if it'll happen
Oh man, I can't wait for my pony collection to take up a whole shelf. That'd look sweet :P
i know right!
hope it happens
The ponies will block out the sun
also, mfw friend came round who's a total townie (going out loads with mates is his life) and checked his mail on my pc, saw derpy hooves windows startup, luna logon screen, mane6 wallpaper, twilight startorb, Spike google chrome icon, twilight chrome theme, and besides my monitor were 2 brushables xD
Ziltoid: Then we will love and tolerate in the shade
Townie?
lol Ziltoid and Daz
wut
HAHA, sweet
That sounds like some fae slang term
fake*
So, is Sathi there?
seems like she is...
I have no idea what townie is either, but my built in spell checker accepts it as a real word :P
townie is sorta UK term
so i told you what it was :3
also: http://i.imgur.com/Wrpj6.png
like a hoodie? :P
don't mind me, just using FiM font =D
townie is a stereotype, that actually isn't used much anymore. dari would probably go 'wtf so old' lol
" total townie (going out loads with mates is his life) " i said what the stereotype was >_<. it's cuz they 'go to town' all the time. see?
>mfw this comic perfectly represents Warhammer http://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/215543608_oPsC3-L-2.jpg
Its still silly
oh okay
and where'd you find FiM font? :O
HAHAHAHA Dermathil that's perfect!
RobotPinkie: want link?
eeyup Daz
dat grimdark
it's so funny and oh god so true. i barely played any mmorpgs, but did play tabletop a little bit. also not much, but a little bit. i know where he's coming from xD
It demonstrates how people react to Warhammer being called a Warcraft Rip-Off (which it ISN'T. Warcraft would've been warhammer if GW had given their ip license to Blizzard)
Yesplz, Daz
oh snap link tine!
time *
http://www.mediafire.com/?891kx1uc98p5u1t There. 10. seconds. flat.
Daz, I got the limited 3rd edition of Space Hulk. Cost about 100$.
Nowai...!
Yaythx!

Anytime, RobotPinkie. Do you know how to install it?
that one: http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m410442a_60010699001_ENSHBoxFront_445x319.jpg
Yeah, I think I do
wait what
i know the one, Dermathil. the one with awesome board that had multiple routs to take :3
routes *
yeah
Like I said, I know the one
Theres actually something called space hulk in the 40k cannon?
yes Ziltoid.
What.
/me checks how much pony he currently has
A space Hulk is a mass of spaceships smashed together floating in space.
64.0GB of pony
Brutal.
Take a thousand spaceships, smash them all together and make them all connect.
Erryone: rightclickprotertiessize your ponies!
Like Voltron?
@ponymeter Daz
6 Daz is 43% pony. (155)
Myep, it worked. Just double clicked the font. :P
my bad, 67.23GB. forgot to check the other folder
oh Dermathil did you get your pony pic?
what pony pic?
I dunno how many petabytes of data my brain stores, but I assure you it's 99% pony
Well, someone gave me your v2 of your pony, and it had THE WORST cutie mark ever. http://i.imgur.com/327Hd.png so i fixed it.
(btw Ziltoid, http://images.wikia.com/dow/images/9/9f/Cr_judgment_of_carrion.jpg this is an example of a space hulk)
THANKS DAZ

Well

MY DESTINY, A COLUMN
I.F.T.4. about 100.

Just got a new 100-pack of Earl Grey :P
O! O.K. T.4. ... crap, how I say 'me'?
nice. btw RobotPinkie do you have other ones there? in UK we have shedloads of flavours
I.F. no clue :P
my favourite is 'chamomile vanilla and honey'
Oh yeah, there's a whole shelf with different types of tea at the store downstairs
that, with about 1/3 ( iknow, a lot, it's the idea:P) milk, and (all in one teacup ) six. count 'em. six teaspoons of sugar.
My second favourite drink ever i think
of course, I don't drink that often
I dunno what my favorite is
I really like the blackcurrant flavor, though
also RobotPinkie - do you have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepy time, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffel, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, and... earl grey?
Ziltoid, another space hulk. And yes, it looks like it is an actual model that was built. http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/4/10/26810_md-Frikken%20Huge!,%20Orks,%20Scratch%20Build,%20Space%20Hulk.JPG

Dermathil: perhaps you'll like this, perhaps not http://www.ninjabread.co.uk/comics/2010-10-11-space-hulk.gif

Dermathil: does the guy in top right own it? he's got a sorta 'yea, you just got pwnd' face

btw Daz http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110217161033/mlp/images/f/fa/Daisy_Dream_and_Rainbow_Flash.jpg
Brushie brushie
I think that's a pretty well styled Daisy Dream right thar
fukken saved ,seeing as i got one on left, and right one getting in a few days
i think it's very well styled, but could be a little more accurate
just a leetle bit
i want a perfect bwushabwe
Probably
I love saying brishie brushie
It's hard to get perfection, though
i know, but I won't give up
Well, who doesn't? :P
Daz, I got no idea.

It's not used much in the UK either, lol
mfw i had omelets for breakfast, Tortilla for lunch, and am about to cook egg sandwiches for dinner. shopping on thursday, i must survive until then!

I WUB WOAST BEEF

10XD
12Bah. Black forest ham is the way to go.
/me 10is more of a fan of chicken. Chicken all the way
5and the slices were extra thick
10aaahhhh fuck. The day I get home I'm going to my local chicken place. it's like half the price of KFC and vastly superior
10I'm basically drooling thinking about it
oh god I love spinach
heh, I'm a rather strange person, I dislike kfc a lot actually
10fair :)
it's just so...greasy...ewww
10yeah my local is so much less greasy
10that's why I prefer it
10it's good chicken too
5which is why im happy cournel sanders kept out of sweden
10and the hot wings are a bit hotter, and the strips are just overall nicer
chicken is one of those things that if it isn't really high quality it's just gross
10hah I disagree, fucking love chicken
10so much
lol
10it's definitely my favourite foodstuff
well dont get me wrong, I enjoy chicken
just so many people don't know how to prepare it
5now i want to mkae a chicken noodle soup for LNS
10yeah I get what you mean. What do you think is worse, inherently 'bad' chicken, like processed crap, or nice chicken that's been brutalised and is dry as fuck?
hmmmm
that's a tough one
10ikr xD
10they're both pretty diabolical tbf
5(mfw fuck isnt actually dry)
I'd probably go with the dry one. Just because a good chef can *usually* make low quality food tolerable

10eww
14For the time being RBD ;)
5though the winters usually stay around -30
about the only time its comfortable to go outside is around 6 in the morning, and you get a one and a half hour window before it feels like the sun has it out for you
also 100 degrees is a fever, so... put those two together and you can figure out fahrenheit.

That was.... not Deus Ex
I refuse to acknowledge it as a sequel
5that is my official attidue against it
I like how you said "Invisible Wars" to make sure no one thought you were serious :P
5:P
Deus Ex 2 is "Human Revolution," from what I hear.
5ahy es
5yes'
well, this is a prequel mind you
I agree with RobotPinkie~
Really looking forward to playing it next year :P
5the "commmercial" trailers about augmentation are epic
5have you seen them=

Haha, oh yeah, I've seen those
when I play this game, I want to experience it just like the old Deus Ex
7dumb windows updates
without any prior knowledge
on par with the Aperture ads that came out before Portal 2
5they are jsut like ^
Same here, ValtheJean
5they dont reveal anything
5jsut creates anticipation
ah

Trixie is best pony. You can't explain that.
4There's only ONE eternity though
I can. She's hot
Trixie comes in, Trixie goes out
That we know of
that's like saying 2xinfinity is larger than infinity

an eternity can not be infinite without being finite

Ooooh.
@sappedmeter sentry

This could be why.
8his name is a play on the mascot

@Additional_Pylones the amount we need
A LOT of Furries are also Bronies of course
@REDSpymeter BLU Spy
6 BLU Spy is 36% REDSpy. (198)
10Octavia I'm lax about sexual stuff. I did fine in that part of the interview because I thought about what the -stream- wanted, not my preference
oops. my bad.
Okay.
But that was just my little theory.
10But I think he's got enough moderating experience though to learn very quickly what we expect of him, in terms of what's not acceptable
12You have to be objective, it's not about what you personally are okay with.
@Additional_Pylonsmeter the amount we need
10I think he'll be fine either way, because of his experience
6 the amount we need is 84% Additional_Pylons. (199)
Well, I was thinking perhaps thats why he was so lax on all of them.
4It's not about thinking like a viewer, you gotta think like a mod
I like how everyone is so content that with the whole lawsuit bullshit
8well, i was leaning towards hire until he went down in flames on the pictures
I know this.l
10I still think hire
12...And still bombed picture test.
@pony the pony with a hoof stump
6 the pony with a hoof stump is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
12After clarification.
suddenly roof leaks
Bewm.Headshot.
@Better than S1meter S2
8>not even kick for 4
Thousands of them?
7i'm a bit on the fence
what happened to Sweetie Belle? :0
4I'm not sure
4I'm also on the fence
man, she really /did/ need that roof repaired
7he blew the imagetest up
3Hmmm.....Well....not that i have a say in this....
I'm neautral
Pony limbs grow back.
....
:p
4I like that he has experience for coding
4But
8im neutral at best, maybe leaning towards a no
All but the pictures seemed okay.
4Mehhhhhhhhhh
@Better_than_S1meter S2
6 S2 is 57% Better_than_S1. (200)
>episode name: TB or not TB
@better_than_S1meter S2
6 S2 is 48% better_than_S1. (201)
dat pun
You can learn the rules better for the posting of pics of course too.
3But he kinda gave minimal on the actual info, basically giving just technical skills
:0
8im more concerned about his mentality, octavia
Everyone loves Sweetie Belle, though she's no longer best pony
omg you know who this guy reminds me of?
that's Trixie
the supporting character in Band of Brothers
8his reasoning for 2 was because it "got a reaction out of him"
3Me too Hipster
TRIXIE IS SPY
8thats not how mods should be acting
12I'm leaning towards no, at least for moderating. Just my opinion. He doesn't seem to have the right attitude for it.
8^
Oh my
So spy is best pony?
3He also only listed technical skills Hipster_Brony
Nope.avi
7i'm leaning towards a no
wait a minute...
NO COMMIE SPIES WILL EVER BECOME THE BEST PONY ON MY WATCH!
shank!
3Me too, although I realize I have 0% say in this.
HE IS THE SUPPORTING CHARACTER FROM BAND OF BROTHERS
8nope.avi
7mod no
8you have say in this DE
OMG <3
People just ignore my say so I'mma shut up. :D
8and so does octavia and cross
10yeah D_E speak your mind, you too octy
7no we don't ignore you Octavia
@pony the pony who is the supporting character from Band of Brothers
12Agree with ghosties
6 the pony who is the supporting character from Band of Brothers is 8Flutter13shy
omg I would squee so much
3Octy?
8problem is here
I'm in Band of Brothers?
Tru
Hmm?
10I guess we can hire for just general coding and site tech support
dose chem majors
8he said he doesnt know html coding yet, just that he's learning
SAVE THE BAND OF BROTHERS GUY
HE FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II
@pony The pony who's a chem major
6 The pony who's a chem major is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
4Still, it's better than nothing
lol
5sensemaking, he has it
So that's why he's on drugs all the time
3RBD, what is this Octy you speak of?
12If he's just learning, than a no altogether might be best. We can keep looking, we shouldn't settle.
@pony the pony who fought in World War Two
6 the pony who fought in World War Two is 14Silver S15poon
10@pony The pony who would take physics like an absolute baller, like RBD
5gona lay down for a while
why not?
Thats a shortened version of "Octavia" DE :P
night Wrek
8we might end up with all kinds of bugs
5bai guise
HAHA
later wrek
night wrek
10cya wrek
3OOOOOHHH
"blow out a candle without using her..."
5also
7true that be he could write us a better randomnizer
10XD
@pony the pony who ignored RBD
4What are we looking at? Just the site, or a multitude of other things? For that matter, what does Perl and C have in common with us?
7write = code
5@pony the pony that will kick RainBroDash's arse
......
5awes
8sathi, that randomizer is pretty high quality
5n/e ways
5nn
10he broke
7Alright, I don't see any use at this point.
NOT MIG SURPRISE
*BIG
4That sounded awfully nerdy of you
OMG, so many mods!
lol
7dat copy paste
Yay nerdy
Just the way I like it
8like i said, from the site
@pony dead
4Bah, I completely missed the "from the site" bit
12Copypasta aside, are we agreed then?
8problem, ghosties?
WAAAAAAAAAH
4Sorry, Hip; I hope I didn't get your hopes up :P
8i think a no is pretty unanimous
4Alright, no it is
awwww, BoB guy is a dick in this
he was so awesome :(
10ok :)
7for the record do vote on the forums :P
8k
is dari trolling again?
8is the poll up yet?
CURSE YOU WRITERS FOR MAKING HIM EASY TO HATE
7will be in a minute
8okie doki loki
@likelymeter Dari trolling us
I'm still neutral. But if everyone is saying no, then no it is. If only he had done better on the pics...
Dari trolling us is 100% likely
12There's a reason we have that section.
6Dari trolling us is 100% likely
7he did not sell himself
7at all
Oh wow it still works
7just technical skills
LOL ELKY
You sneaky trolly man
is this hospital pager friendly?
Well, I know that CB. lol
3Wait....how did you...
4Like I always say, the image test is the most crucial and telling portion of someone's capabilities as a mod.
THE DARI SCRIPTS ARE DEAD
HEAD FOR THE HILLS
0dat plot
4You can say you're the grand ruler of China, but if you don't have good judgment then it doesn't matter in my eyes
15Elky don't you mean PLOT?
:P
0YES
PLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT.
8inb4 dari rages about the pic test
It helps.
10:3
0dem tracts of land
7First interview was a no-show btw
3Wait...dose that mean ANYONE can color!?
4inb4dariwhinesthatweshouldgivehimachance
7Yusuke that is
If we had the grand ruler of China in the chat, I would start making Shity Wok references.
3OH SHEET
WAT.
0Denied_Existence yup
0weeeeeell, you do get kicked eventually
10Why would you say that
OHSHITSON
Doubt it
I'd test, but I already got my first warning from being the first volunteer :P
What have you done D-E
10and I'm going to kick/ban anyone who does in light of this ;)
4Be a good way to troll him. Unfortunately, I'm sure he'd have no idea what South Park is
0I think the warnings expire after some time
LOL
Scripts are still active
Fuuuuuu-
3RainBroDash I think Dari's scripts are down
Probably not.
10ikr
0or maybe you could just login again?
But I'd laugh to myself at least. :D
THE GAME
Of course... then he'd probably bomb my house.
Poor Cat
0I won.
6I doubt the scripts are down. Lets see.
:0
12So in all seriousness, it seems today brings no new blood.
0Way to overkill, n00b :P
3Cause nothing sends a message like a cruise missile through the chimney
10oh look, I said I'd do it, I did :3
0Scripts are still up
0yep

hi
4But we've had an eventful week
0heh
10thanks robotpinkie for sacrificing yourself to find that out ;P
LOL
0I was going to show it by getting autokicked, but not gonna do it now.
mfw the auto kick/ auto join starts again
THE GAME.YOU LOST IT.
0hey barry
4four new mods, LF on the stream, and DCD made a comprehensive guide for excellent streaming
Can I use this couor
UP TO ELEVEN
12And season 2!
4I'd say we're getting close to our goal: Season 2
/me 12is so excited!
8not to mention we're going to be the primary stream for the brony community
4That's right
4Seth sees us as the primary stream
10so good:)
12Good on contacting Sethisto about that.
0This is a great episode, though.
0Damm, it doesn't let you use black
Are we? Seems like a new stream pops up every day now. :P
4Well, I'm not surprised in the least that there are competitors popping up
0lol
Well, of course not.
8octavia, sethisto is going to link us as the primary stream for live pony eps
Its a fun thing to do.
12We have the organization, set-up, precedence, PR... I think we're it.
4We're getting close to the premiere, so it makes sense there's gonna be rivals
0Soon that's the only color available for a new mod :P
And many can easily enough do it.
0inb4 there's a rainbow mod
I thought dari used black?
Trying to think.
0Isn't it dark blue on white?
0dari has gray iirc
10also having an established 200 viewer count is a plus
Bronyville is really good. But they are pre recorded, so yeah. No video either.
I always thought it just looked that way because of the gray background
10nah it's blue on white
0lol I have no idea
Then theres that third one, Brony Show.
0Oh, I was close. :P
And soooo many Synchtubes.
he was faking it
just wanted to jump on her
I'm wondering.
10well synchtube can't do anything for livestreaming
10for a start
I used to frequent Everypony Radio a bit. I wonder if they'll try something along the lines we are for S2.
Doubt it though.
3I GOTS ME SOME SKILLZ EH GHOSTIES!?
4What matters is that we've got a major advantage going into Season 2
4Seth denotes us as primary streamer
8we have so many advantages over the competition it isnt even funny
/me 8feels arrogant
7So tomorrow last 2 interviews
Who is this bitch? :0
lol
3 2 more eh?
8i might do a swot analysis of brony state at some point
Heh
/me 12thinks Hipster and the BMN team has a right to feel 20% cooler than all the other streams.
8might be helpful
Go ahead, talk to his superior. :p
4Well, DE, you're a mod
4It means that you're a positive to us
3Aaaaannnnndddd...I am a frequent paneller on thebronyshow.
oh that camera cut
I got nothin',so.....Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba!
4@CB: To be fair, I don't know how structured the other streams are.
4But I'm also inclined to believe that we're definitely ahead of the curve
/me 12has scoped out the competition. He knows we are.
0lolol
Lets just not jinx ourselves by getting too proud. :D
7we are awesome
4True
0it's weird that only a few decades ago, tuberculosis basically meant you'd die
7so many ideas
0Stupid woman like it when patientce get better
7so many projects to finish
4Our real measure will come when Season 2 starts
Eeyup.
7we're all gonna be busy
12Eh, w/e. Might as well get pumped about it and do our best.
4However, Sath's right
4We got a lot of stuff in the making
7and...so little time
Lots of stuff and little time to do it in.
4Especially the stuff you new mods probably don't know about
4Including Sath and RBD
O rly?
7im not new
3Well...what I heard on skype pretty much sounded like everything
7i'm old :D
8no
8me and ghosties are old
4That's right
7okay you win
8you're new comparatively
Salad magic
12Oldfoals gonna oldfoal.
3Also, how will we eventually prove our readiness for full Op?
8:3
3Cause I gotta ask eventually
4When we feel you're ready
7give it time
Stack salad, get free steak
0LIKE A BAWS
3And will anyone ever let me practice on some images, considering thats my weak point?
Luna suddenly?
For a split second, but still Lina
8>unrelated, but hilarious: http://i.imgur.com/r6DVJ.jpg
Luna*
/me 4doesn't get the image that Hipster posts
Dun disappeared
4...like always
4I like crayons!
8bah, ill just post it in skype then
I fuckin love coloring
3That is actually funny
0Me too! Oh god, we should totally marry!
10rofl
3But seriously
0Crayons are delicious
:D
4Oh, the irony
Lmao
3OH GOD THE CRAYONS, THE ARE SO FUCKING GOOD
4Does Ponychan even GET anymore?
3Er....YOU SAW NOTHING
RED IS DELICIOUS
0crayons go with all orifices
0I used to chew on crayons when I was like 3
0Black was my favorite
4I see red in chat

12Don't you pfft ponychan me mister.
3HOW DO YOU DO THAT GODDAMN RAINBOW!?

0inb4 ban
4Or did !!Celestia finally move it?
8no, they GET in /chat/ now
I do it with magic.
4Good
RED is the best tasting color. http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100829000305/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/6/68/Tereziredchalk.png/476px-Tereziredchalk.png
brb
8cuz /chat/ is faster anyway
12They GET in /chat/, it's faster now. And they're ending soon.
4One of the better things about the massive cleanup
THE MAGIC OF SCRIPTING!
0lol I read that as "RBD is the best tasting color"
8>inb4 sprinkles rage
Om nom RBD
/me 10is the best tasting colour
12The massive clean up killed /oat/. It made me a sad pony. But it'll be alive again with season 2.
4Sprinkles isn't here enough to rage anymore :P
/me 0licks RainBroDash
4herospirit used the wrong picture
0Tastes like teal
:[
8THIS
What does Teal taste like?
0more like tea
4But yeah, the clean up really destroyed /oat/. But let's not forget it defiled /chat/
What picture SHOULD I have used
stream's derping
0I dunno, like RBD
0yup
8nah, /chat/ is fun right now
4Fun to you
4Not to the originals
8the serious, slow stuff moved to /dis/
10mfw the mod chat is now ponychan
/me 10cheers
4But yes, the regulars got their own board
D:
4Which is, unfortunately, usually filled with pony related topics which should be moved to /chat/
10D:
So RBD, what do you taste like?
HE'S A FRAUD
10Wouldn't you like to know
0Haha
RBD tastes like Seeeeeeeex.
0Only I know
7dat media
0and I'll never tell!
I know as well. :I
TASTES. LIKE. SEEEEEEEEX.
But I'm not sure what sex tastes like
lol
I guess like RBD?
4Fuck yeah, you tell em House
0RainBroDash tastes like diabetes
12My opinion, boards are good in their definitions, content just sucks without new material for the pony centric boards. /Meta/ never loses its charm though.
0I guess Apple Fritter knows by now, if the rumors are true.
10O_o
4Trust me, I go to /meta/ for the fun and drama
4Now that board never gets old
10so much ponychan
12I haven't seen you around lately at all though. Where have you been?
4Me?
hey RainBroDash...I'm in the hospital in SS right now :P
0I really hate that man.
4I'm curious, do you remember me?
12yeah you
8lurking lol
12of course I do.
4*nods* I was curious if you remember the first time we crossed paths
Nope, just Colgate knows what he tastes like so far. http://i.imgur.com/uopaa.png
3And I am apparantly the Veterinary assistant who normally works with the Nurse on Vet stuff
10MirthTinker, the actual hospital? Or the kinky silvermane-is-cosplaying-a-nurse hospital
0what.
12Soldier's birthday thread? Might have been before that.
Dat Bjornfot's project picture
8guessing you mean soldier's birthday thread?
4It was Soldier's birthday thread, yeah
the actual hospital, we're rping
I can't click the pic link. they vanish for me.
0do I want to know about that rainbro?
12dat herd thread mind
PIC LINKS ALWAYS VANISH. D:
4In which I ranted about Soldier
0lol
D:
8>implying you and I aren't already the same person, cross
3OH GOD
4And was swiftly met with criticism from Cross
peelz
i.imgur.com/uopaa.png does that work for you?
3JUST A HOSPITAL MAN
12@Hipster, true, true.
8well, you did it in his birthday thread, that was the mane problme
8problem*
12Yeah, well, we had differing opinions. Nothing wrong with debate.
0dat colgate lick
Well thank you so much for the picture Dashite. :I
10>birthday thread
so they finally convinced him to take it?
Yup
4I just hated that we had a freaking thread dedicated to a poster that created large text walls on an image board, regardless of his birthday or not
/me 10doesn't get imageboards anymore
And you are welcome herospirit. :D
:I
8me and breezy argued the first time we met too
12It's an imageboard/forum hybrid.
4Despite all that
12Yep, we sure did.
4I actually don't hate Soldier anymore
!jump irc.ytalk.co.cc
0EqD's active tonight.
4Now my anger has shifted to amonisis, whelp, and moony
4But mostly Whelp and amonisis
10well nah, it's an imageboard through and through. Just with very active mods and a forum-type 'clique and social dynamic' thing going on
8how can you hate moony?!
12>also has problems with Moony and Amonisis, but not Whelp
4As I said, I believe Moony believes in the love and tolerance. I fully believe that he buys into his naivete
8so?
8to each their own
4Therefore, I'm not gonna rag him too much because we've spoken before
:D
8you basically are saying you dont like him because he's nice
4And we have come to respect one another
12Agree heartily, let others be as they wish, it's their choice, as it is our choice to like or dislike them.
4What I'm saying is that I didn't believe his niceness
4He comes off like a bad tumor from the sugar that Ponychan has
8i cant remember who told me this
8i thik it was mewball
4But I actually believe that he believes it now
4I believe in his niceness now
8but moony used to be very depressed, and he came out of it with a much bigger appreciation for life and love
12I believe he believes it, but his misuses it at times. Ghosties, if you thought the birthday thread I made was bad, you should have seen the Czarnival.
3What we talkin' 'bout?
4.....are you serious
8ponychan
4Czarnival
0does anyone else think those incredibly specialised one-way hospital appliances are really cool?
4For Czarina
8that czarnival was RIDICULOUS
12The enitre chan was overrun with Czarina Wreath appreciation and birthday threads made by Moony.
4Please tell me you didn't make the thread, CB
4Okay, good
8i love moony, he's a good friend, but that was a terrible decision
12I didn't, it was all moony, but I fought it in /meta/ to no avail.
12If it was anyone else, they would have said no.
4There isn't a single person on Ponychan that is better than the other; appreciation threads should never be made for individual posters or so called "factions"
8i was gone for that entire thread
12The community that is.
>mfw PK is talking in episode 18 of the Bronyville podcast
8what ghosties said
0PK?
8although a single birthday thread is fine to me
12I agree, but I still like birthday threads.
Author
12Just one though.
4In that case, we should hold birthday threads for every poster
Antipodes
12If you want.
4Because no one is better than the other
12I don't mind. Someone just has to make them.
oh House, you so troll
0ah, fic author
4Point is, it'll eventually piss people off if we have them everyday and all that sweetness is gonna come off saccharine at some point
4Therefore, it should NEVER be made
0lolol
10^
4It's not fair that we hold a birthday thread for just one poster
8usually people make them for themselves
ung..
12There's nothing wrong with a little sweetness. And they're much rarer than you think.
8i made one for myself, mostly as an excuse to make a decently interesting thread
4I still think it's not fair that a couple people can have appreciation threads and no one else can
8cuz /chat/ was boring that day
0Cameron is 100% POMF
12I don't agree with appreciation threads at all.
4But you made one
4For a friend, sure
4But you still made one
7Shows over for today / Tomorrow the next 4
12It was a birthday thread. Difference.
awwwwww
8the appreciation threads are silly and pointlessly divisive
4Are you sure?
alrighty, cya Sathi, I guess.
0Thank you for streaming, Sathi <3
4I was seeing an awful lot of praise for Soldier in that thread
ow many dayyz, sinz I was bawn, 'ow, many dayz, sinz Ah DIIIIIIE.
7might be streaming something else though
as always, tyvm sathi
8birthday threads are just a celebration of that persons birthday and an excuse to have fun
7any requests?
oh
hmmmmmmm
12Wishing someone a happy life and good day is much different than proclaiming someone as deserving of the communitys appreciation.
that traffic cone
I want the cone back
0vlc
0tempted to say sea ponies
8is it not normal to compliment people on their brithdays now?
KILL IT
stream the cone
Do it
KILL IT WITH FIRE
7first a reload
Call upon the sea ponies. I'll get a harpoon!
....cone...
10I say happy birthday to my friends in the pub
They call him Nittany...
:[
4The point is people know Soldier for what he did at the time; make large text walls that came off all inspirational and stuff
Hello everypony what's up
Hi.
Sathi killed cone
hello taliesin
4People actually know Soldier on there, it's something that I still don't agree with
0hey Taliesin
10but granted I'd give you happy returns on your birthdays
0But really, Rescue From Midnight Castle is just half an hour long
but otherwise going well
Yo wassup :3
0hi Taliesin
that's nice.
4And besides, if you make a birthday thread and not expect to be showered with praise than you've got something loose in the head
8soldiers last text wall was back in june, and it was a joke about telling peanut how to make cake XD
alright
name it
i'll look if it's available :)
12Kind words are appreciated and expected, but I never said "Praise the mighty Soldier".
0lol just as well
4Really?
12And he doesn't write textwalls anymore.
though I haven't tried magnet in a while.
4You said something in your OP that kinda came off like it
0He's not in the chat, so...
4Even though you said it was sarcasm
Nope, still gone
meh gotta go fix some stuff, later :3
I should just keep a list for times when you take suggestions >.<
4Still, some people actually believe that stuff. They really held Soldier in high regards.
12I told everyone to write spoof textwalls in a kind of loving parody.
Cya Tal
oh no
8i hold soldier in high regards because i respect him and he's a good friend, nothing wrong with that
OH NO
OH GOD
:[
0OH GOD WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN
NO!
WHAT
4I guess my main problem with Soldier's position at the time was that we were putting select persons on pedestals. Ponychan was becoming this place where if you didn't have a select tripcode or name then you weren't accepted
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
WHaT IS THIS
OH GOD WHAT G IS THIS
0yay
4And levels of appreciation differed
oh
A G THAT SHOULD STAY DEAD!
SHUT UP SPAZ
my
god
12And I still do gold Soldier in high regard. He's a good guy, and a friend.
enjoy the stream :P
4>gold
0This is G3.5
12But I see what you're saying Ghosties.
G3.5?! NO, IT CAN'T BE!
3.5?
0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
WATCHING THIS IS WORSE THAN CHILD BIRTH
SOMEONE WAKE ME FROM THIS HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE
RUNN
NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE!
8but you were essentially blaming soldier for something that everyone but him was doing
SHE SAID RAINBRO DASH, NOT RAINBOW DASH
FUCK
4That's true, I was
4I don't deny that now
0why is that song so catchy?
8namely, deifying him
dear god, kill it with fire
RainBroDash /is/ pretty stylin'
and restart it so i can listen again
4But he was the face that I could pin the problems on
SATHI! Y U LOVE TORTURING US?
0I mean, it'S obviously not sea pony-tier, but still...
WHY DO I NEED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE
4So, naturally, like any angry person I ranted at him
Watching the "Strictly for girls and no-pony else" ponies?
0Sathi, u such a troll... why wub woo for that, srsly
"Twinkle Wish Adventure". oh Celestia just kill me now
Winter Wishes!?!?
12He did talk it out with you though.
mfw Narrator
Winter Wishes < Winter Wrap Up
4I see now that Soldier was just a minor consequence of a much larger problem on Ponychan
these voice actors are terrible
4Yeah, he did
4I gained respect for Soldier that day
why is Twilight Sparkle a pegasus
I will murder you. I WILL MURDER YOU ALL
me first herospirit
please
4Ironically, it was the same thread where I completely came to hate Whelp
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
0That voice....
ever-forever-green tree?
dear god, did the character just ineract with the narrator?
...........................

8y u do dis?
why is their town so tiny on population?
dat MURDER MODE
THAT IS NOT PONYVILLE! NO IT IS NOT
4Yes, I am CB
it was requested
0Thank god my EeePC only cost £40
Scootaloo's sister is Cheerilee?
seriously, why the hell does Pinkie talk like she's slow?
8oh lawd
0Ok its on fire now
4He's a childhood friend
Lol.
KILL IT
0Scootaloo is best pony. Prove me wrong.
their heads are too enormous for their tiny bodies
>half an idea
>twice as long of a show
lol
their necks should be snapping under the weight
these eps take 45 mins
MY EARS ARE BLEEDING
0 45 minutes?
i'm crying brony, crying
Scootaloo is the fastest filly on a scooter. prove me wrong
7yup
/me 0hugs Sathi
Sathi, I may resort to such drastic measures as coming to your house and smashing your computer with a baseball bat
0FFS, my eeepc is on fire yet is is still plying this
DON'T MUDDLE THE ISSUE WITH YOUR FANCY WISH-MATICS!
0inb4 Pinkamene
0lolol
why didn't she just follow with them?
SHE SITS LIKE LYRA
FFFUUUU Flutterpony
...and yet it doesn't make this show any more tolerable...'
II HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF BLOOD
7okay!
Lol at old show.
What... was... that?
12And Whelp's been my good friend for a long time. I understand why you dislike him, I can even understand it, but we just disagree on him. Just want there to be no hard feelings about that. I'm fine with your opinion on him, just don't bash him too much when I'm around, alright?
CRY
CRY LIKE A BITCH
the only thing she could do: murder everypony.
the writing is terrible, and they were talking to the narrator
indeed
this is hurting my ears, and my eyes
BuT nO mOrE sOpOr SlImE pIeS mOtHeR fUcKeR
haha GGgala, I would like this show SO MUCH MORE if that happened
also, too much narration is never a good thing
0Dumb rock
4I get the feeling that based upon your previous question, it's to let me know that you won't rag on Cyberpony because you dislike him as long as I don't rag on Whelp
7aww
the show doesn't even hae a background
14Nope
wow
how in the fuck did that happen?
foreveralone.jpg
she fails so hard pine cones eat themselves
12I got nothing against Cyberpony (though I wish he'd switch back from Marceline), it was just a segueway about friends.
7so any other requests?
hmmmm I just thought of something
but but but... I LOVE cheerilee... why are they raping her character concept
Calm Pinkie Pie. Slow Rainbow Dash. Yep. One-dimensional show.
the next time someone talks about how awesome RBD is
I'll link the glitter line >:D
4It's fine. The mods already know my position on Whelp, and that was before you came along, so, yeah
>predominantally pink
(also i can't spell today)
14Pickalicious!
8i think cross' point was that you would feel bad if someone were bashing Cyberpony all the time too
14*pink
7oh oh
0Positively!
how do you forget a SISTER
12^
4However, I am curious as to how you know that him and I are friends. He's aware that you know who he is despite the Marceline tag
Well, that was for girls and no-one else.
SilverMane...you must realize her concept makes her WORLDS better as a cameo in G4...this G didn't exist in G4's canon as the characters don't relate as they do anymore
14Well, that is indeed somethnig to forget...
4But it doesn't mean that you know him and I are friends
14She really loves her sister I guess. ;)
4Unless Hipster
4told you
8i probably told him
0"We're sorry" THE END!
4*nods*
so...when do we end this?
4And Hipster didn't know until I told him
/me is about to end it now
/me pulls open the drawer
8i honestly never would have guessed
/me lifts the button
0They don't call her "rainbow" and "dash" for nothing!
7enough trolling?
7you had enough yet?
/me presses the button
if pinkie pie uses pinkerrific in G4 I'm going to slap a hoe
dear god yes
0noooooooo
/me watches the resulting explosion safe from 3 states away.
0not the button!
12You have similar posting styles on ponychan, but no, I didn't know for myself, how could I? I just asked.
14Hey, my lucky button!
It is shitty in itself, though.
0it looks like a wheel!
PLEASE MAKE IT BETTER AND GIVE US SOME G4
4Similar posting styles?
0fheww
4Do you follow us around or something?
DAMMIT

4AW FUCK YEAH, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH. GODHJFOEHNFOENFIJNEROIN;OPAWENFOWEAWE
7:D
0more!
7see?
/me was in the office when G3.5 was streaming.
7nostalgia!
12No, I'm just on the site all day. Told you, I work from home, I have a lot of free time. I was aware of you and Cyber as I was of everyone else. And I pay attention to people who say things worth noting.
0Play some 'Kim Posible"
I can hear the voices in my head again!
7any other requests?
8breezy has a knack for picking up posting styles
these writers take lessons from Scrub's on making RE-haHEEEEEE-lly exaggerated syllables
this doesn't look like 80s animation, and it doesn't look like 00s CGI. were there more?!
4>worth noting
I mean err...so glad that's over <.< >.>
4Cyberpony will laugh at that, I assure you
0I want Kim Posible
8he posts on /meta/ a lot
Pegacorn: you missed the greatest shows ever made
0requesting darkwing duck
The Super Mario Super Show
8so both me and cross see him a lot
My computer derped.

0DUCKULA!!!!
4Ducktales, woo ooo
12Feel free to tell him. his posts are helpful, in a parasprite kind of way. Sometimes you need that abrasive kind of attitude though.
0GO WITH THAT PLZ
so what is this program you're using Sathi?
0lololol
/me swings his hips...from side to side
do you have to pay for it or something?
7nah
0I loved Duckula as a kid
4It's why him and I are friends. Well, it's a minor reason why
7just a good internet connection
10ReticentSmolder...Nothing at all?
Come on lets go, come on do the mario
4It's no secret that him and I tend to share the same view on Ponychan
Pegacorn: we showed G3.5 MLP, *and* Strawberry Shortcake while you were gone
nono, for the videos and whatnot
0What progrmae is that
0?
/me takes one step, and then again
0sounds interesting and bordering on the illegal. O like
YES
4I used to really do a lot of that kind of stuff around the time I started leaving Ponychan
YEEES
4DO IT
12Why'd you leave?
4PLAY IT
4PLEASE
itbegins.jpg
0WHYYYYYYYYY~
4Love the mario song
You know what pisses me off these days?Those stupid "Don't be afraid of the dark" ads.THEY HAMMER IT IN MY HEAD!I FREAKIN' HATE THEM.
oHAI Mario.
SAVE ME
14....
14FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
HELP ME MARIO
YEEEEEEEEEES
0>mfw Mario is both mafia and gangsta

14"NOPE!"
/me is very....very scared now
...mafia IS gangsta
...original gangstas homes
UHN UHN
so... just WHAT color is Peach's hair supposed to be?
4Variety of reasons most likely. For one, I was getting more involved in Brony State. I also began intensely disliking the community there as well.
/me 7is brb closing bedroom door
7or my bf awakes
14Dat mustache
0better lock it, you don't want anyone walking in on this
Spaghetti on your overalls!
*canned laughter*
14Blinded for life.
4Dude, this Luigi's so much better than the movie Luigi
These are the ONLY IRL Mario and Luigi
0This Mario is so much better than the movie Mario, too
what the hell, is she in a mirror?
0Why is luigi played by a 73 year old man?
7you guys happy?
14Bitch, what'cha doin in my freaken mirror!?
These are the perfect Mario and Luigi
only Pinkie Pie's allowed in my mirror
/me 0meows approvingly at Sathi
4True dat. Captain Lou Albino is amazingt
4*amazing
/me 7meows happily
14She needs her "kitchen sink" fixed...
12I see. I multi-task between the two now. But I love the community, I'll be there for it til the end.
14>plumbing
10bleugh :P
I'll be back in a while guys, gotta go eat dinner.
10cya herospirit
14They are obviously nervous about woman and plumbing...
0later
see ya hero
4I used to really enjoy Ponychan when I first found it
14Later Hero
12Too sweet for you, RainBroDash? hehe
bukkake
oh shit wrong chat
0...
14;)
4I had the same feeling a couple nights back when we discovered Season 2 was coming the 17th
10implying it's not riddled with really really silly social dynamics that take more effort than they are worth
0uh... okay
10just my opinion, I don't expect you to share it :P
...lawl, Reticent
12>implying it's not worth the effort anyways
10LOL
12But you can have your own opinion, its cool
/me 10joins SS
12I'm not overzealous about it.
0the schutzstaffel?
Yeah bring him back so she can force him to perform feats of manual labor!
10:D
10I'm glad
4Cross, how do you feel about the people that complain about the state Ponychan is in?
10since it's an argument I'm not up for trying to explain
0Oh man, this Mario voice...
7any other requests?
14I'll climb your mountain Princess... IF YA KNOW WAT I MEAN
10I've been there, and imageboards are /NOT/ worth my time anymore
8depends what they're complaining about ghosties
Polar? BEAR?! LUNCH! muffins! derp
4I asked Cross, Hip :P
4I already know your stand
10WADDAYA TRYINA DO
0oh wow
0BUKKAKE
10this is intense
14Oh goodness, its Twist as a dragon
10I can't deal with this
12To be honest, I hate it every time someone says Ponychan is dying or ruined forever. If they bring up valid points that I feel have a solution though, I'm much more amicable to their position.
0this is almost as good as G1 ponies
/me 10turns off stream and goes back to skype call xD
4You two really do think alike, don't you?
7:D
12Do you disagreee?
4I do
8like i said, we're the same person :3
0I honestly enjoyed G3.5 more.
14KISSOMS ARE A COMING
0and that's saying something
8im also the same person as sprinkles and browny
4As I said, I used to really try to voice my concerns about the state Ponychan was in right before I left
OMG! MARIO!
14Pasta power!
I'm back
14On ice... doh ho ho
0just in time pega
mfw I thought those minions said "come on let's kill King Koopa so we can put him on ice for good."
4Bowser has a foot fetish >.>
he likes his feet....licked...
10I'm a horrible elitist. I refuse to believe that my understanding a problem will help it be resolved if I think there are others who don't understand it, and/or -are- the problem incarnate. That's one of the main reasons I tend to stay away
then i was like, no.
12Ponychan has had plenty of problems, it always has, it will always have more. Bad OCs, rogue mods, factions, poster worship, serial threads, and all sorts of other things.
10XD
12But they can be addressed, overcome, worked through. And I put forth my best efort to do so.
14Shes on shrooms.
They're all on Shrooms
/me YFW That purple dinosaur thing is canonically a male
4And are you saying it's useless to voice those concerns?
10Well I don't think you can teach a dumb pony clever tricks
14This is true!
10just my 2 cents
12Not at all.
8nope ghosties
10as crude as that is
4>mfw I called your response
8i do it all the time
Bob-omb!
confound this gender ambiguous being!
/me YFW also that purple dinosaur thing is canonically a cross dresser
4Oh god
14Its a male? Really?
Really it is
14lol
Yup, Birdo is canonically male.
4I resist
10Yup^
8resist?
14>mfw /facehoof
4I will NOT start finishing your sentences and phrases
4I refuse to do so
8:3
0ALAVA-
AND THEN THEY DIED
8hey, we can be the same person too!
4NO
10oh lawdy
8ONE OF US
14The end!
8ONE OF US
4NEVER
lol
4I'm happily independent
4Thank you very much
4Well
Is Sathi streaming?
0eeyup
This is the unholy spawn that created Twist
12Voicing your concerns is valid, I'll always listen to someone who sees a problem. but to claim ponychan is runied, dying, unsalvageable... Never gonna agree with that. If the other person can't come with an attitude of open-mindedness as I do, we can't get anywhere.
those wings don't look /remotely/ like wings
those are stubby little arms
Ok.How's about we play some requests after this?Just a suggestion.
7already am
0thing is, that WAS a request
Pegacorn, you are never getting that L4D video. :p
7just shows and series
7no youtube
like a bawss
8there always needs to be dissenting opinions to prevent groupthink
Does Nostalgia Critic count as a series?
4And we both have noted that and are terrified by it
8its how those opinons are expressed that causes friction
0>bird
0it's clearly a baby dragon
12You're terrified by what now?
4The notion that Cyber and I are like you and Hip but with different philosophies
...it's a hat
/me 10is alone
4We also finished each other's sentences once...it didn't go well
Brb,gotta take a bath.
4We scared the shit out of each other
0wash off the shame?
0understandable
lol
10aaaaaaahhhhhh shit shit this buddy-buddy conversation just reminded me that I'm moving away, which means I'm moving away from my best mate ;____;
4LOL
4...oh, I mean "Aww, sorry RBD T_T"
10me and him are like, exactly the same person >.>
10except completely different
/me 10makes sense a lot
retreat due to falling vegetables
hoo boy
10but yeah, longest-lasting friend ever. It's gonna be fucking weird to not have his house a phonecall and a taxi/lift away
10>.>
4Why are you complaining, you're gonna be mere miles away from Beachy Head
10ikr, gonna be lush
raep imminent
10except i got my accommodation confirmed
0wtf
10they gave me the most expensive one
7shoeeee
10£125 per week
10that's 204 bucks per week
4You should totally go to Beachy Head at some point and then film the footage there
10I'm gonna have 8 dollars per day to live on
4late 80's/ early 90's humor
4gotta love it
4OH DEAR
4ZELDA
WELL EXCUUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
>scenes from the next Legend of Zelda
0but WHY
oh boy, the Evil Jar
this show was painfully short, I think it got cancelled mid-season
inb4 well excuse me pricness
12Sorry to tangent back, but why does Cyber still post on ponychan if you believe the same about the site?
7oh what about dungeons and dragons?
GGgala, too late.
GGgala too late :P}
4Toasty
4DO HO HO
...crap
12And I hope for the best for your move, RBD.
Dungeons and Dragons the movie?
8because ponies
7nah no movie
8:3
7series
The TV series
0sea ponies!
D&D had a TV series?
there was a series O_o
EXCUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
argh there it is
Yes
7u win!
0slutty party
4Probably because he also loves the show and because he does it because he kinda wants to help others. And also because he enjoys trolling idiots on there
4It's mostly the last option, IMO
DO THE MARIO!!! SWING YOUR ARMS FROM SIDE TO SIDE!!
two old men covering a young lady in cake
4Er, last reason
only in the 80s....
12I've seen plenty of him doing that, to be sure.
4AW FUCK YEAH
4THE MARIO DANCE
4NO
4NO
4WHY
14lol
4WHY
0NOOOOOO
lol
trolololo
4IT WAS THE BEST PART OF THE DAMN SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
14That was the best part. :P
0the only bearable part of the show
7so whats next?
Cause Sathi mod is troll mod.
4Sath, y so mean T_T
no but seriously, there was a DnD tv series?
why have I never heard of it?
YES!
7yes there was
4It's hilarious
YES THERE WAS!
0let's watch it
was it any good?
4At least it is in my opinion
4I'm sure you two might not share the same opinion
0somehow, I doubt it...
like...what's the premise?
DAT TIAMAT
You'll see.
12I usually get a laugh outta of it. but I think you should give the site another chance for Season 2. i think it will solve alot of the problems.
4Well, yeah
WAT
inb4 I hate it and everyone hates me again >.<
12No pressure or anything obviously.
14Wow, I didnt know there was a DnD series either....
0but...
OMFG SNIPS
8the only thing that annoyed me is that i made a thread to cheer up observer today and he called him annoying and said he didnt like him at all
UNICORN
TIAMAT
4Him and I both figured out months ago when Ponychan became worse that things would get better once Season 2 started
WHY IS SNIPS IN D&D
0it's like a show in fast-forward mode...
Suddenly acrobat was a class
4I don't really care for Observer either, honestly
/me 12was never on ponychan while season one was still airing.
why are they fighting Tiamat, Evil Chromatic Dragon Goddess?
4But there's no need to get in that
8right, some people dont
12feelsbadpony.png
14Oh wait
Because they are the good guys and Tiamat is the bad guy?
They don't know nothing to their bestiaries
14I think I remember hearing about this very vaguely way way back
8but you dont need to post it in a thread thats trying to help make him feel better
Sorta.
4I don't dislike him as much as Cyber though
what are you talking abou--holy shit it is Snips
4He's voicing his opinion on the guy
4Not trying to be polite
10Also, in a public forum
12I've only known post season ponychan, probably why I'm okay with its faults.
so... why don't any of them have real weaopns?
I realize why I never heard of this show
8the OP of the thread was to show that people on the site really did care about him
HFW
...no redeeming features
4I'd rather Cyber voice his own opinions and be truthful than be polite and fake
why are they so...
TIAMAT THE DRAGON
not bothered by this?
8cuz he told me yesterday he was convinced no one on the site liked him
10If you want to only get positive responses, don't post a cheer-up thread on an imageboard. lol.
4Haha
4That's pretty funny
WAT
dose physics
8imo he should have just stayed out of the thread
@roll 100
12Perhaps the best option would have been to remain silent. No need to make someone feel down.
4Then I have to wonder why Observer comes back if he thought no one liked him
Tia... mat?
wait, what was the roll command?
that's not how you pronounce that...
8if you dont have something nice to say, dont say it at all etc...
4Trust me, Cyber doesn't care
8brb, going shopping
@roll 20
oh...I haz a sad
Silvermane
the next time we have a DnD game
10Well I'm all for having friends over the internet, but if your mood for the day really depends on if people on ponychan like you, imo you have a screw loose
I demand that I be given a pet Unicorn named Uni
...
0heh
yfw its a familiar class
The next time we play DnD, you will be a pet unicorn named Uni
4Cyber's like the mischievous rebel that refuses to conform to being polite and sweet when it doesn't befit his honesty and truth
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Icanlivewiththat.jpg
4At the very least, he's not Hitler
that is the most adorable unicorn ever
4But, even then, I love Hitler
7no way
7go south
4Because he's actually funny
>yfw uni is a little unicorn
Oh god, dungeons and dragons
10adolf hitler?
so... no food or weapons?
What we watching?
better*
>yfw Hasbro owns the licenses to D&D
DAD'S LIMOUSINE?
4Yeah, he's a resident troll on Ponychan
0oh wow, there's some nice thunder outside
the jerk guy is rich? whattatwist
OH NO, NOT LIVE TURKEYS
4Who, strangely enough, likes the community and not the show
10oh, right. so not actually hitler
CLOSE ENOUGH
12Hitler, bush, and Hackkula are all good natured parasprites.
WHAT EVER CAN WE DO ABOUT LIVE TURKEYS?
I went to a comic convention once
4Bush is meh
hurry, kill it and eat its flesh!
4Hackula is hit or miss
Wat is this
The guy cosplaying Preston pretty much pwned every other anime cosplayer in there
Actually it was an anime convention, to be precise
12And sometimes Hitler goes too far.
WAT. WAT.
12They all have faults.
/me 12shrugs
He was so good, he didn't get a prize because he wasn't cosplaying a character from an anime
And most people threw a tantrum
wait... which character is Preston?
I'm back
>mfw a floating island is more awesome than a building on a cloud
Yellow magician
That always fails
So what is this?
4I inadvertently called Bush trash one time and it made me all warm and gooey on the inside
What the hell is this?
7this is nostalgia
how does pony climb ladder? :(
I leave for less then half an hour, and suddenly THIS
4It was fun
0that's not Snips, that's applejack
DON'T LEAVE THE PONY BEHIND YOU ASS
What are we watching. :0

ValtheJean, i read a good story about Snips and Snails that actually made them legit.
Is it bad that I already knew about this movie/series from a piece of hentai?

10LOL razyn

4Alright, later
Well, I try...
0I just wanted to know out of morbid curiosity anyway
I've seen enough hentai to see where Tiamat is going
I need critique, halp

He-Man's powers: fabulous

0that guy's soooo deep in the uncanny valley...
BECAUSE HE'S HEMAN MOTHER FUCKER

The ambiguously gay heros
Dat fist shake

0dem special effects
0it's sufficiently advanced technology
"I'll stop you He man!" *shoots the wall instead*
Is this... is this fantasy or sci-fi, why can't they decide
0Why do they have to?
i... think it just qualifies as... worst acid trip ever
0wait, was that a beavis laugh?
0Hand holding? In my 80's boy television?
is Skeletor a skeleton in a suit, or a creature with a skull for a face
YOU BOOB!

7eagle girl!
0I believe he has no flesh anywhere on his head
oh dear god
7how stoned is he?
I hate to say it everyone
very.
0he's a skeleton disguised as a creature who also has a leather outfit under the cape
the proper question, is how sober is he
but this show is less Manly than My Little Pony
i think G 3.5 was manlier than this
7:D
that's what I meant :P
7I knew you all loved it
7+ strawberry shortcake
0It's not unmanly, it was the 80's
because naturally FiM is manlier than everything :P
YOU MUST ALL TOUCH IT.
of course, G 1 is so manly it turned girly, for it went out the other side
nono that's no excuse for "let's make a comet and fill it with the power of goodness!"
0I wish we had actually watched strawberry shortcake
0It feels so evil~
DONT THINK ABOUT IT, YOU MUST ALL TOUCH IT.

0That's been bothering me this whole time
lol Elky, SKELETOR is blasting off again
only one step between orbs and comets
that laughter...
they laugh at Orco's suffering!
0Dear Princess Celestia
oh. my. god. the show has... A MORAL!?!?
But with natural male enhancement, even an old wizard can regain his confidence!
Oh no

0Silvermane, It's one of those movies made up of different stories. One of them is centered around a germaphobe, who hates roaches in particular.
0Lauren Faust just animated for PPG
eh, wish I could take credit for it
close enough
but I just saw it on a comic at one point
I think it was on memebase actually

what else is he in?
i love these voice actors
Oh god, I love this show!
0implying dinosaurs didn't have the best finale
wait
>implying FiM doesn't have the best future finale
is Norbert voiced by Norm?
Elky must feel so alone :[
so much beaver love.
...how?
0too tired to feel anything really :P
7how about some Eek the cat?
SilverMane: in that case requesting the Angry Beavers 'Network Slam.mp3' linked here after this show: http://www.micahwright.com/downloads.htm
0Rainbow leaves
thanks GGgala
0Dat post
/me is midly curious
mildly*
0hm
0another presentation
"Is there a more hostile environment out there than an entire class of hormone enraged 9th graders? I think not! Yet these two stood their ground and sang Giggle at the Ghostly in front of ALL of them. "
0boooooooring
7Elky?
Dashite. they are future presidents and rock stars
7What do you want next?
Oh mah gog.
YOU'RE AFTER MY ROBOT BEE
7I was asking Elky
watching the 9th grader video
:(
0no, I'm quite happy with what we're watching
7ok
7as long as it's no catdog right?
0eeeeyup
ARI!
OUCH. They were really brave to do this, but....
OMG
SO. OFF. KEY!
I actually rather missed this place
what, you don't like CatDog?
well, I rather missed this place when it was quite active and adorably random
but I missed this place nonetheless
bad touch
0Wasn't that bad. The clapping was the worst part
0And not even bad
CatDog, honestly, scared me half the time. it was so weird and confusing, but it had decent stories usually
Nawwww, i am not that memorable
Same CatDog situation as SilverMane here.
Eh
To be honest
Of course you are
yeah, CatDog was just... no.
I never really got into catdog <.< >.>
Weeeeeee!!!!!!!!
And thanks!
0The only thing I liked to watch was cartoons, so Catdog was already up there.
i like the part where their parents are apparently a frog and an elephant, or something...
14I... actually kinda liked Catdog at first... :P
remember the catdog episode where they were going to get seperated via Pendulum axe?
I liked CatDog, it was weird but I still liked it.
it's a shame things like Xat exist, otherwise IRC would be quite popular
SilverMane: eeyup
and I would like to imagine bandwidth usage would decrease
how does Norbert not hear or feel any of this
because he so chill :P
How is that car operating without gas?
0rule of funny?
Instant Dam?
0I always thought this episode was weird. They completely swap attitudes afterwards
no kidding
pilot episodes and all
well we know how THOSE are :P
it's weird. They took Norbert= laid-back = lazy and useless in the pilot and reversed him into competence
0Some offer plot continuity, while others change characters. Also, dat Rocko.
Rocko!
ROCKO
Old cartoons > new cartoons.
*cough* Elements of Harmony *cough* um what? say what? I didn't say anything
i never could get into Rocko
0Whaaaaaaaaaaat
0Rocko was crazy awesome
Rocko just... weirded me out
0I wonder how OOC the ponies will be in the first episode of S2
0Always some batshit crazy one off
Out of character?
7best night ever!
Elky: I doubt they'll be out of character
nothing can go wrong!
Pilot =/= first episode of later seasons in terms of changes and whatnot
0well, we will have an adventure episode
0inb4 crash
0so it probably will be different from the rest of the season
in terms of plot yes
but their characters will stay consistent
0That was hilarious. We need more cartoon physics.
0so there is some potential, since different plots require different characters
0well, we'll see
0I love that phone
different plots don't require different characters
When I was a kid I wanted that phone.
you can have any kind of plot, and just have the characters react to it as they normally would
Actually, I still do.
oh thank god, I just figured out how to change my background colour, now it hurts my eyes less
0yes, but if they're initially developed for other plots, they'll react the same, which is boring
I'm not sure what you're getting at
My wireless SUCKS!
0which is boring
oh god, I love the Angry Beavers' B movies so goddamn much
which has no place in FiM
0yeah, I exaggerated a bit
0>trying to stay awake during an episode about sleeping

Edwardnewgate, dawww
>dat plot
wtf
Dear Princess Celestia, I learned today that you can only be a true friend if you brand them in the butt
Just reviewing Cal III class
Branding is just the real life version of a cutie mark.
Nittany_Tiger, soooo... what you're saying is...
I should sit on the stove for a minute to get my special talent?
inb4 cannibalism
SilverMane: Yes.
4Oh hell yeah, Rocko's Modern Life
eww
?
Ahm Back.
I am kinda half heartedly doing Principles of Business homework
I can't decide how I feel about Rocko's Modern Life.
4Can't decide???
4You serious, bro?
I feel I should be entertained, but...
POTS
0He wants some pot
For some reason, it frightened me.
4I know an episode that will make you laugh
Oh, they are funny. But for some reason silently terrifying.
Man, this show used to scare the shit outta me
4Sathi, stream Bye Bye Birdy
I think it's something about the animation, for part o it.
I think this is the last stream for the night
7yes it is
7tomorrow more
4T___T
0yes, the animation feels kinda...
Wrong.
0no idea how to describe it
It feels wrong. :0
hey hey hey
I've seen plenty of Ren and Stimpy
Except I love both of those shows
OH GOD. We do NOT talk about R&S.
he's a wallaby...what species is his uncle?
:I
7oh god
7Ren & Stimpy
damn.
That show was baws
7*notes down for tomorrow*
ung Ren & Stimpy
I saw enough of a cat eating it's own shit from the commercials for R&S.
Sound is lagging.
it's different creepiness he's refering to Ghosties
4>weirder
he's not saying the content, just the way it's done is off-setting
4>but Rocko is weirder
What Val said.
Yes
Rocko has an episode where the whole world is taken over by sentient vacuum cleaners, though.
4Meh, whatever you say
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4YbO_1mvA&feature=player_embedded
I remember that one GGgala
4Ren & Stimpy are still far creepier in animation style
and that's how Equestria was made!
4No doubt about it
Ren and Stimpy was a little creepier, but this is really weird
The Vac-U-Suc 9000 or something.
4wut
4You guys...
4Something's wrong with you guys
oh god is this the episode with the green thing?
This doesn't look weird to you, Ghosties?
IT IS
4Nope
0I think the right word is dirty
YES! THANK YOU, Elky.
0Dat sticky thing
The animation is just s, ugh
You found the word.
0you never feel like anything in the show could be clean
My sound is lagging on stream.
i love Rocko's Modern Life. i can see how people find it "disturbingly visceral" though
to be fair
4Yeah, stream is lagging as well in sound
Rocko's was made during a time where everything had to be hand drawn
oh god my ribs
4It has a unique animation style
7pc is tired
and making episodes as fast as it did was rather taxing
Now, that's not freaky?
Anyone notice the sound lag?
I do.
4I'm telling you, nothing's freakier than eventually turning into bologna
7try a refresh
0hm, maybe it's just that
my brain is full of fuck, EdwardNewgate. and i love it
Ghosties, but that was funny as shit, this is so...unfunny
4>funny
4>eventually turning into meat byproduct by a nasty disease is funny
4>a slow
The miracle of cartoon garbage disposals
4>gradual
4>turn
I can see where Rocko would be funny if I wasn't so... unsettled by it
But it's the way the episode was animated, when they ran down that hall, it was awesome
This is just, not funny to me
4Yes, because slowly, gradually turning into meat is hilarious
But I love johnan Vasquez, so I'm a little biased
4And I cannot understand that this isn't a very funny ep considering it was one of the beginning eps
4It gets much, much better
4*er
4I CAN understand
>implying Rocko doesn't have similarly terrifying premises
4Tell me
Sound is lagging by 1 second
7not fixing it
7 3 mins before bed :P
the VAC-U-SUC 9000 Nittany_Tiger and i mentioned, for one
14Streaming awesome shows is so much cooler than sleep tho Sathi :P
4How is a vacuum running amok in the world terrifying?
Okay, you'll laugh at be for this, but....
at me*
7I have a meeting in the morning
4It just sucks up everything, there's no visceral transformation like meat disease
did you misss the ending? the vacuums eat /everyone/. nothing left in the world but vacuums
that's like saying "how is a single moose in an empty room terrifying?" :P
in retrospect, I also found Rugrats very unsettling
4But the vacuum can't eat
4It just sucks up
4They're still alive
Rugrats... dear lord, some of the shit i've read about that show
7goodnight everyone
4Night Sath
have a good night sathi
Cya.
night Sathi
14G'night Sathi!
7hope you enjoyed
thanks for streaming for us!
Silvermane, what have you read?
4I did
Night Sathi
4I enjoyed it
0night sathi, thanks for streaming
14I enjoyed the shows <3
The music in Rugrats was extremely unsettling
4Well, Mark Mothersbaugh did the music
YOU'RE AFTER MY ROBOT BEE
This was a nice trip through my childhood.
The show got crap past the radar like you wouldn't believe
I loved the Rugrats music
4So, naturally, it's creepy
4The one thing I remember that was naturally creepy
Rubrats, I mean
Rugrats*
4Was the ep where Tommy goes to find his new 'sister' at the post office
And the animation was, again, unsettling. Maybe it's pastel colors that weird me out?
Lol.
4and he goes down the "no return" aisle
I remember that one.
0and that's my cue to go to bed too
14Hey now, I liked Rugrats growing up :P
0good night guys
it's probably just the older style of animation hero
14G'night Elky
But this is gold http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vs55Z7t7bk
night, Elky
again, hand drawn versus computer
night elky
gnight elky
0That scene I love it
4There's signs everywhere telling people "POINT OF NO RETURN," "NO EXIT."
Oh god not the pudding Newgate. NOT THE PUDDING
4And when he finally gets to the end of the line
4It's a long fall
4to a pit
4With a /skeleton/ at the bottom
That's nightmare inducing
4Yeah
That's... pretty strange there, Ghosties.
4It's pretty terrifying
14"Mmmmm... I like pudding..."
The point of no return address.
The music in Rugrats makes me feel like all is completely wrong in the world. :0
0Don't you just love it?
all the streamers are nighty night now :(
:[
it was fun
14:(
indeed it was
14Curse you DSL!
sounds ironic
What now...
/me wishes he lived in the east coast and whatnot
Wanna keep talking about Rugrats? :P
14If I had cable, I'd be streaming. But this connection cant hardly handle it.
/me 0wonders shy Val would want that
principles of business, half-hearted
I have no clue how to stream, so yah.
cause, I'd be more time synced with bronies :P
I loved Rugrats
I liked it as a kid...but looking back on it....ung...
I remember liking it as a kid....
I like a lot of stuff, it's just Rocko freaked the fuck out of me when I was younger
But looking back....
14I watched Rugrats growing up all the time.
Rugrats is silently terrifying.
14Then I watched All Grown Up. Yes, I watched that.
The movies were so baws
oh god
oh godf
NOT THE SPIN OFF SHOW
/me pukes
Do NOT look in Stue's basement.
14:D
Octavia, speedtest, now. Everyone else did it. :p
0It spawned so much smut
14I did. lol
14Its slooooooooooooow :P
And you watched All Grown Up? O.o why?
0Speedtest?
Speedtest?
0hermind
14Especially with my roomie up and hogging all the precious bandwidth :(
XD
0*herdmind
Damn roomies!
/me doesn't have roomies
14As for All Grown Up, I dont know why I watched it. XD
How do I make with the testing of speed
:0
www.speedtest.net
14^
14Speakeasy is another popular one.
14I usually do both.
well, I think I might play some LoL for the rest of the night
14Just for a second opinion.
new champion out and whatnot
There's a 100% chance you can't beat Sathi
21/3 :(
it's been fun gents
have a good one
bye Val
AllisZero, fuck you.
14Laters Val
No seriously. I hate you.
/me hugs Dashite
14And Ed, screw you. ;)
4What's wrong here?
14Haha
I only state the truth
I took the test, and mine's pretty slow, too
Alliszero mentions 21/3 connection speeds as if it's a bad thing.
0So I did speedtest, what do I do with this info?
14:D
The cake is not a lie dammit!
15.68/1.94
Not saying it's bad
14It is now! >:|
But it's Cable
mfw I forgot Octavia was a mod
FFFFFFF
14lmao
9.74/1.05
ouch
AllisZero, but it's only >5x what I have.
:I
0What are these numbers?
14Better than my speeds
download/upload speeds
14Upload and download speeds
Dowload/upload speeds.
Which means when the neighbors decide to stream 1080p porn, I'm screwed
ninja'd you both
14FUUUUUUU
14Barry!
I'd do one, but my wired speeds =/= wireless speeds.
Barry also got the right order. :p
So did I.
14Oh pfft :P
0I have 10.7/3.2 That good?
My wired/wireless speed is about the same.
Yeah Raz
14I have like 5-6/1
14Seriously
Octavia, I have 4.5/0.7 ish
I run 20/3 during goods days, but at 70ms ping.
mfw the closest server is 45 mins away
14Oooh, you're in the same boat as me
Tests over Wireless shouldn't matter a thing unless you're far away from the router or have a shitty access point layout
2.67/.69
That's bullshit
I live in an apt complex and fight between other wireless router's outputs.
And that's because if you're using Wireless G you should be getting 54Mb/s. So unless you have internet that's faster than that, you're golden
Oh goodness Newgate
My wireless is crippled by interference.
ADD A BADLY PLACED ACCESS POINT AND YOU'RE FUCKED THO
It's slow and tends to drop.
>.<
The only redeeming factor about my internet is it's not as bad as EdwardNewgate's. Also I have no bandwidth cap.
Haha, I have no idea how to do all this.
:I
250GB/month for me has proven plenty
But that isn't going to last
250GB/month would be nice.
I had a 60GB cap before switching providers.
I don't even worry about it. Five people in the home and there's no way it's even close to that
14I dont know what the cap on ours is, but we've never hit it so... lol
My speeds are dropping.
I have infinite bandwidth, too
The closest you are to the server the faster it is, usually
14Last place I lived my roomies opted for this really expensive but stupidly fast connection.
So your distance to the servers is going to affect your speed
14We couldnt even handle near how fast it could run. lol
...
14Think it was the areas lines
14They couldnt handle the speeds
We need a new conversation point :0
14So we downgraded
haha
At work I'm getting a fiber circuit
14We all gamed online though and the slower one was fine :D
14Mmm fiber
We're using 10 megs now but can burst up to one gigabit/s
cool
nice
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwwvM4LKGg&feature=related
:0
Our current provider told us there could be no fiber in the building...
They signed a contract in January for extra bandwidth...
14I will play for you the song of my people!
Futurama, such a good show
I'm STILL waiting for them.
Verizon gave me no cap, but I hated their customer service.
Is the music that's playing the actual song, or was it just an overlay?
Then we signed another line with a different company, they fucking dug a trench for about a mile in seven weeks and brought me fiber in 2 and a half months
And I only got 3/0.75 on DSL.
It was an overlay :P
I hate verizon with all my passion
Yeah, I realized that when I checked the full title
Verizon sought to never get off of their asses and come and see what was wrong with my internet even if there was anything wrong.
Instead, they did line tests, then just told me it was my problem.
damn them
The last 3 reps I talked to before cancelling my server were rude, too.
Now they don't really employ reps anymore I don't think. They're 90% automated.
double damn them. May they rot in hell for all eternity!
And I hate automated answering services.
Yep
We have service with them at work
They drive us to drink.
was that to me or Nittany, AiZ?
Nittany, Barry
ah
We have to test our network from the outside from time to time and we have an aircard. We get NO signal whatsoever in there
It's very hard to get a human rep with Verizon anymore, even if you hit 0 during the menus,.
I called them to get them to install a signal booster for our office, they said they'd charge us for it
Biggest network my ass, Boost mobile gets better reception in the area :\
Yeah. They wanted to charge my dad for a signal booster.
Because he was in a dead zone.
Though he lives in SC, which is fairly thick in coverage.
Yeah it makes no sense to have that kind of crap with today's tech
All tech made by humans will have bugs
I got a 4G phone from them, kept it for two weeks cause the signal was just shit
Oh yeah, iti s
Well
Like you can get awesome speeds in Hong Kong or Japan for dollars cheaper than here.
No, not quite crappy but
Well, England's internet is worse than the US's from what I know.
In terms of broadband adoption we're still way behind
In Japan people have metro E connectivity for super cheap, it's insane
But there are still places in the US that have no internet service.
Like the plains.
Where population densities are too low to make it affordable to companies.
Corporations won't build to those places if it's just to look good on a PR note
They couldn't care less what public opinion of them is right now
I know that.
COULDN'T CARE LESS<
SEE I LEARNED
lol
I bet they could care less
if they worked hard at it
See the one thing I'm not really understanding right now is
and used the magic of corperate friendship
Why people aren't out on the streets mobbing up government facilities
I can't enjoy one of my former favorite hobbies because of poor customer treatment.
I just came back from the grocery store and saw that a liter of mineral oil is like 5 bucks
But corporate friendship isn't profitable.
Gas is down under 90 dollars for who knows how long, but gas is still $4 a galon
It's $3.59 here.
I'm not even a commie but this is just ridiculous
Err, oil
I'm partially socialist. I think some industries may need regulation.
Starting with the one I pay great attention to: the gaming industry.
What be in your mind
About the gaming industry?
They've been pretty crafty recently. Things like purposefully removing content to sell as DLC.
The PC industry is being choked by large publishers forcing anti-consumer measures on consumers like draconian DRM and big-brother systems.
Yep
EEyup
Then they want to abolish used game sales with online pass systems (affects consoles).
But I think DRM should be the first thing to be regulated.
The government is in the hands of the RIAA.
It's become so bad that it serves to cause more piracy than stop.
You see all the proposed legislation to regulate the internet even more in the past few years?
Yeah, for the benefit of the corporations.
Like S971
That's just lobby from these big groups trying to get a tighter leash on everyone who goes online
"Protecting children from internet pornography" my left asshole.
They want to abuse the internet for profit.
Corps are more concerned about piracy than content.
It's funny though, because there're a lot of studies that show that people who pirate content are MORE likely to spend money on that content than otherwise
Meh, some of these suggested bills and what not are the kind of things that start revolutions. Governments aren't THAT stupid, are they?
I take it with a grain of salt, haven't read the studies myself, but meh
I've decided to either pirate Ubisoft games or crack the DRM out if I'm ever gifted a PC copy of them.
Are they? ;-;
They are, herospirit, but that's because right now they can get away with it.
;_;
I'm tired of their "Always-on DRM" shit and won't support them.
Ever again.
They aren't that stupid, they just think you are too lazy to do anything about it.
^
Ubisoft, huh? What games do they make again? :0
The western populace has been pacified enough that we'll take anything up the ass and be told we're to enjoy it
AC series. Splinter Cell. Ghost Recon.
And some other titles.
Got ya. I'm not good with company names.
Might and Magic series.
Blizzard is also doing the same with their battle.net system where you can ONLY play the game if you're online
At least one of those I enjoyed, but I had to pass up on the last Splinter Cell due to Ubisoft still using their DRM.
Yeah.
They're making D3 always-on.
And then they get surprised when everyone hates them for it.
Diablo 3 apparently requires you to be online or to lock up if you aren't online for X-amount of days
No, it's always-on.
You can't play SP without an internet connection.
Which is very stupid.
The funny thing is, someone will probably create a client that emulates the activation packets within days
Blizzard assumes that everyone will play MP.
Or have stable-enough internet not to be bothered by the system.
Unless they encrypt those packets, then it might take a few weeks.
I wonder if Ubisoft's latest trick will land them in legal hot water.
Where they lied about the DRM for From Dust.
What, does it call home all the time?
Saying it was one-time activation, but it was a log-in system or always-on.
The funny thing is
I don't think people who pirate the game were actually going to buy it in the first place, at least a lot of the time.
Maybe I'm just weird, but the games I really want, I go out and actually buy'em one way or another.
I buy them to obey the law, but having to deal with DRM like Ubisoft just makes me want to quit that.
Exactly. :0
I don't want to connect to the internet to play a SP game.
And they're not going to force me.
Unfortunately, I think more publishers will use Always-On DRM in the future.
Steam
Steam has an offline mode.
Ubisoft doesn't.
When it decides to work.
^
Most of the time it just decides to not work
brb
I've had few problems with Steam, but it doesn't kill my game when it disconnects.
Ubisoft's DRM will kick you out of a game if it disconnects.
Oh really?
Now that's precious
The old version did.
Old version did what now?
It would either kick you out of the game, or freeze it until it reconnected.
Wait, why did I log out to change my name, there is not +N
Gay
Yeah. That was really dumb
I don't know what's in store for the new Always-On system.
But I don't care.
Anyone wanna talk about something less depressing? No? Alright, I'll be over here. :I
lol
My copy of Deus Ex arrives tomorrow. :D
I haven't played the first one.
Hey Ghosties!
Is ghosties here? :0
Dunno, he's on the list.
He's been idle for the last 40 minutes though.
I wish one of us could Stream. :0
Alright, gonna leave the drawing where it is and go to bed
Nittany_Tiger any interest in the first Deus Ex?
I dunno.
Also, the new one is a prequel.
G'night, Allis
I have so many games.
So many I haven't touched on all platforms.
Or unfinished.
I have Mass Effect 1 and 2 untouched.
Deus Ex 1 and 2
The X series.
Star Wars PC games. I've stopped playing Dark Forces for a bit to play other games.
Yah, game piling happens. :p
See you all tomorrow, good night.
Later.
I'm trying to beat The Force Unleashed, which I don't care for the controls.
I just have a ton of games to run through.
Plus I try to get into the best MP games, but my skills at FPSs aren't good.
So much raging.
And it sucks when the modern FPS MP give people that have played longer edges over newer players.
Or like CoD, give good players killstreaks to throw matches out of balance.
Hey guys, check out this pony name generator. http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/toys/namegen/15185/
My Pony name is Chacha Twilight. :0
yfw I reverse engineer that name to get your real name
XD
I'm sure I'm not the only one in the world with my name :P
probably not, not to mention last names are so unique that it can't process them as whole words
My name is Cranberry Scotch
barry is fruit flavored Alcohol. :0
Thank you thunderstorm for knocking out my internet and then my power
WOH. Suddenly more people.
DASHITE. PONY NAME GENERATOR. DO EET. http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/toys/namegen/15185/
I am Chacha Twilight. :0
Hmm... nope.
:[
95% of the stuff I get with my name is horrible.
But how could a Pony name be horrible? HOW?
14SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO!
14And I killed the chat with one big blow. :D
14Cant beat dem sea ponies.
/me drills the fact that Octavia didn't home.

/me is having a hard time reading the latest FO:E chapter. Goshdarn this thing makes you /want/ to cry for them.
It's really easy for a pony name to be horrible.
DO IT, FILLY
*flutterstare*
/me has torn the organs that made tears out long ago.
Then you shall shed tears of blood, mortal.
Pfft. No tears here.
(I'm practicing to be a JRPG villain!) :3
Herospirit, needs more DOHOHOHOHO
He needs more spiky hair.
Getting tired. No!
Maybe a bigger sword. at least as big as his hair spikes.
AND A PET FISH ON HIS SHOULDER!
...Back. I was practicing my DOHOHOHOHO, but I was thinking more of a GGRAAHAHAHAHA.
Also, bigger swords are hard to come by locally, but I'm trying. And last time I tried the fish thing, it died. :I
Expenses for a JRPG villain are large. SO MUCH HAIR GEL.
I can get a genuine Sephiroth replica sword at the mall for like 150
not to mention the Master Sword, Keyblade, and a set of samurai blades
and some assorted bastard swords, longswords, katanas, etc.
Darn you and living somewhere cool and not in the middle of no where.
herospirit, i live in flint. #1 or #2 in the country for homicide. and it's empty
:0
just happens to have a new specialty store at the local mall
Why so much homicide. :I
Not enough people play videogames there, Herospirit.
And we all know murders are done out of boredom.
Obviously.
That's why I d- I MEAN...
lol, we have a high murder rate just because we happen to have...
um...
honestly, i have no clue
murderers?
well yes
So much murder
that... that is technically correct
but the reason for so much murder and existence of so many murderers, i don't know
I just imagine your daily life
Walking down the sidewalk and stepping on a body

Entire event missed. XD
Gothfigs?
sadface
efreet: those sound spooky and nutrious!
they are
quickly! tell hot topic, so they can start offering pigmented produce
DJ: irrational hatred for buisnesses are silly.
No, all corporations are evil, because capitalism and my liberal arts professor.
capitalism is a pretty evil system, thats kinda true.
Not really.
Explain how it's an intristically evil system.
Particularly when applied practically.
how about
we discuss pinkie pie
Political debate arriving in 3... 2... 1...
Pinkie Pie is a capitalist, she works at a store.
And I like fudge, but if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
Because it puts people into the mindset that the main goal is dominance and wealthy. Its not a worthless system, but if you pretend that its a perfect system then you're just being ridiculous.
Nickel_Scream its not irrational.
DJ: then why do you dislike it?
I disagree.. Pinkie Pie doesnt work in a store
She helps out in a store
Nickel_Scream I tend to not support companies that dont respect intelectual property rights, especially those of small time artists.
Work requires payment
It's not a perfect system, no. Practically, it's the best we have.
Actually was that actually addressed in the show? Whether Pinkie was paid monies?
She receives room and board.
DJ: You're talking about the pony shirt right? Didn't someone sell it to them under the pretense it was theirs?
I dunno tbh
Rad: This might be true. But pretending its better than it actually isn't particularly correct either.
thought it was more of an apprentice system
Also, whatever happened to Pinkie's Amish family?
for pinkie at sugarcube corner
Come to think of it, how do most of the ponies make their living? AJ is covered but does Twilight get an allowance from Celestia or something?
It's still the best one that works.
probably still out there, moving the rocks around
AJ/Rarity have their jobs.
It's like Churchill said, 'It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.'
Rainbow Dash probably is payed by Cloudsdale as a weathermare
True Rarity is covered too.
DJ: so... you have half stories from people who've complained? I mean, if people are selling them the art then its not really their fault, its the people pretending to own it.
Radimir :V
and pets..
rarity and applejack have been shown onscreen to be working way too hard for it to be a hobby
Hey, Shark!
Rarity always has orders to fill.
Radimir: capitalism and democracy aren't synonymous.
Coconutswallow: Indeed, shouldn't Twilight be paying Celestia for teaching? I guess twilight being a librarian. she would get payed for that
Awake for 27 hours, yay. ;D
Sharksky.
Nickel_Scream: no, but the point stands: capitalism is probably the worst economic system we have, except the others
Chloroform.
I know, I know, Nickel
Nickel_Scream why are you vehemently defending HT?
Hmm, this is true. I highly doubt being a librarian really pulls in the dough.
although it's possibly more debateable
I hope Celestia doesn't charge much...
I was just using a similar situation to explain my point.
Rachel: thats really irrelevant.
Whoa, wait, you're attacking his motives?
Rachel: My point wasn't that theres thing better than it, just rather its not perfect and has flaws.
In which case, the money she gets for being a librarian goes straight back for being a student
Twilight never gets paid.
DJ: I'm not. I'm pointing out your irrational hatred of them.
Nickel_Scream: oh anyone who disagrees with that is probably a republican yeah :-)
She's got massive debt from Trollestia
She probably had to take out a loan.
kinda like when the money stays in the bank when you go pass Go and then land on the tax square on Monopoly
rachel, your point being?
Rachel: I don't really know where you got that, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.
<blink/>
Rarity probably is the group spender come to think of it.
What's your point that somebody who disagrees with Nickel is 'probably a Republican'.
she's just baiting.
True.
Either that or shes very stupid.
I'll assume the former since its less direspectful.
I am inclined to believe that ignorance is the issue here.
Pinkie Pie probably is able to rack in enough customers for the Cakes, she gets some allowance from them
:V
sure it was facetious, though the kernel of it is the belief that any form of regulation is evil socialism
Judging from the spelling and grammar used.
Did I miss anything amusing? o:
How old are you, rachel?
43
Yes. Sharksky
Chloroform.
Ooh, we had a massive philosophical discussion in EAD, Shark.
I don't want any.
A few hours ago.
AWWWWW
/me sneaks up behind Sharksky and applies rag of Chloroform
Corprate regulation is "evil socialism" yet personal life regulation is "Good
What kinda philosophy? :V
?
Regulation is awesome.
Whether Rachel is 43 or not.
General stuff. Meaning of life, free will, existance of aliens.
Political philosophy
Results: None, none, probably.
Aliens are real.
Nickel_Scream your assumption that I "hate"
Pinkie Pie has contacted them.
Strange, was discussing existance of aliens with my friends earlier, along with alternate universes and chemical compounds.
Free will? That's lightweight stuff...
Nickel_Scream your assumption that I "hate" hot topic is incorrect
To be fair, that topic came in later.
Radimir.
When the discussion was starting to wind down.
Mmm, I should go sleep. but ponies.
Let us discuss something important.
Ja?
DJ: I doubt that. because all you've done is accuse them of misdeeds.
Pinkie Pie and Coffee.
Nickel_Scream hate is far to strong a word bro(ny)
Is it physically possible?
DJ: then when asked "what if other people are jerks and are just selling them things they dont own" youre put for the question "Why are you defending them?" instead of answering.
Efreet like? OMFG PONIES ON SEPT 17TH!
Pinkie and caffeine? Let us not think about it.
Nickel_Scream okay.
Is what physically possible?
DJ: Don't be a tool. Just ebcause you liek a cartoon doesnt put you above human feelings.
Just like the Mythbusters crossed with MLP:FiM
Nickel_Scream fine ill put it in plain english
Pinkie Pie + Coffee.
Pinkie Pie explodes.
Nickel_Scream i dont give a buck enough about this debate to continue.
I think that's the proper conclusion Sharksky.
!link http://img.ponibooru.org/images/76/76a2205a5fd05c7c98f058dd89b2ac3d
Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
DJ: alright, if you can't answer the question feel free to drop it.
Stop saying that.
That's the Mythbusters comic.
Nickel_Scream so I would rather let the bucking issue drop because really, who the buck cares about what... no, now you're just goading me back into the debate.
So, guys, which ponies do you hope to see in season 2?
DJ: I was actually serious. If you don't want to talk about it any further, I respect your decision to end it.
I hoep to see Vinyl Scratch
Nickel_Scream clearly not, "if you can't answer the question..." I can, I just dont give a buck enough to :3
Efreet ditto!
The one and the same!
Needs more luna.
*Luna
The musical ponies in general are quickly climbing my ladder of favourite background ponies.
Needs moar Kind and Caring Celestia
Thank you FallSilently. I didn't even know that existed. Instant fave.
Efreet im really wondering what the heck they mean by the opening tagline/synopsi of "refinding the elements of harmony"
They've forgotten their elements.
Rainbow Dash has become disloyal
etc.
Pinkie Pie makes alot of ponies cry accidently
Does that mean that Twilight has become a pegasus/earth pony?
twilight's the only one who hasn't forgotten
but
she's like
yeah. unable to conjure it up
Efreet pretty much all the psycholical reversals we saw in s1 such as YOURE GOING TO LOVE ME!?
Fair enough. Need the one sane man.
None of them "are" their elements.
They just represented them.
Applejack was SOOO dishonest towards Pinkie Pie in Party of One.
They acted as living conduits for the pre-existing powers.
Yeah, Pretty much.
Im also curious who "discord" is(although i have a feeling its the pony in the baloon from the commicon poster..)
I know that Nickel
:V
Ooh, that could make sense, DJ.
Never thought of that.
I love this picture of Trixie
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P2vEbJdv4PA/TkzNO2lg8WI/AAAAAAAAA0w/ms8ySDLypzA/s1600/42923+-+Trixie+artist-Meidomane+pose+yeah.png
heh, also first time I ever booked work off for a tv show. huzzah
That is indeed an awesome picture. Trixie rocketh.
(put in a book off request for sept 17th xD)
I wonder how many people are doing that, DJ....
I used to hate trixie
*gasp*
I like this picture.
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--EOMfS6fEbQ/TlG5P2BL_2I/AAAAAAAAACs/M17NPkJXsBE/s1600/trixie_the+magnificent.jpg
then I saw a really sad pic that suggested her bluster was because of a sad backstory.
then I just felt kinda bad for her.
Yup
I love that one. I just found it yesterday.
FallSilently Id laugh if theres actually a statistical bearing for people booking time off work. :P
how big
do you think the ponies are
Well
Somebody did that apple comparison chart.
Fragging internets.
If it was on a weekday the nation's lecture halls would be empty.

At 9am, a simultaneous harmony breaks out from every laptop:
My Little Pony, My Little Pony...~
LOL
heh
Including the lecturer's
that would be amazing.
What the hell is thiiiiiii-
Suddenly classes would break out into everyone singing the theme song together.
Actually, it'd be awesome if someone organised that.
o: Yessssssss.
a new dialouge of brotherhood would be forged. At lunch that day, people would discuss things not as neighbors, but as family.
Sudden improv singing? I approve.
On the 17th, organise a huge group viewing in a public space, with loads of people on laptops with the volume way up.
im considering organizing a meetup for the ottawa bronies to watch the show on the 17th live, if not that definately we're organizing an after-show meetup

Heehee.
I don't comprehend what's going on anymore. o:

Hahaha. I got a brony to come on to this IRC, Hopefully.
Efreet- Where can one acquire such a chemical so easily able to manuever through the internet?
Well that is annoying
Pinkie Pie sold it to me.
What is annoying, pray?
Enough of your anaesthethics

People who don't shut down their computers when they go to sleep are weird.
Oh.
Hey, it's their powerbill.
I don't shut down my computer because I'm a pirate.
What if we don't actually sleep? What if a agency comes around and gathers us up and kills us and leaves a clone?
Yarrrrrgh
I like listening to music while I Sleep.
Nickel_Scream.
I hate you.
Now I'm thinking about that
its pretty terrifying if you think about it.
Prove that it doesn't happen.
And like cancer and major diseases are just the machines that clone you breaking down the gene sample your made from.
Prove you're not just a clone with the same memories as the real Nickel.
Well arguably there is no "real" nickel.
Each day had a different man.
I'm just todays.
Well, there would have been, initially.
What if this reality isn't real? What if you're outside the Matrix somewhere and your memories aren't real, but you've JUST BEEN PLUGGED IN?
Radimir- The proof is that no one in their right mind would clone me and I'm still here.
but he would've been a baby and been able to have no real expeiences.
WHat if this isn't reality..
his clones are more real them him.
Think back five minutes ago. Are those memories real? Or programmed?
What if everyone is in the Matrix except you?
What if this is what ponies dream of?
And they actually think that they're ponies in Ponyville?
Or, what if:
we'll need to go deeper into the dream.
Did I just type that? Or have I just been switched on with that preprogrammed?
Ponies dream of Humans.
You're a pony that's in a program that simulates human life.
You can't get out.
Oh god
This is making my head hurt.
best book ever.
I loved its movie adaptaion, Glade runner.
My mind is full of buck.
So, basically
You could be hanging out on Ponyville
But instead you're trapped in a simulation of human life.
if you could bring summon the ghost of Zsa zsa Gobor, you're kinda required to bind it to a rarity figure.
I shall awake from this dream..
Its worth considering that if you ever get ghost-binding powers.
and become a full pony!
Ooh, maybe if that's the case, I'll wake up because I realized it.
Or not...
How many of you here are actual Matrix victims, and how many of you are freed humans hacking in from outside trying to wake me gently?
Maybe we'll all go to sleep sometime..
and wake up
/me raises hand
You're the last Matrix victim, FallSilently.
I'm trying to wake you gently.
I'm sorry.
We can't wake you.
Wake up.
You must die.
You, wake up.
You're asleep. Wake up.
I'm just a troll here to spam people.
Sorry.
100% confirmed
Okay, I'll accept that some of you must be Agents too.
Season 2
September 17
Yesss!
YES.
WE KNOW.
Whoo!
No, you're either an African or European swallow, Coconutswallow.
Which is it?!
I don't care, I'm too hapy.
/me pokes Shaico's belly.
Apparently, in season 2, your favourite pony dies and is replaced by Trixie.
NO, PINKIE PIE
Neither. He's clearly capable of carrying a coconut by himself, hence the name
Coconut: I can't NOT read your name as coco Nutswallow and think of the most awesome blaxplotation character ever concieved.
/me pokes Colgate.
Dang it! Off the bridge again?
/me hugs Shaico like there's no tommorrow
'Nutswallow' makes him sound like a bitch.
Can't...breathe...
well it would be a chick with an afro.
Liek the biggest one ever.
She's just a hoe, then.
/me lets go of Shaico "Sorry"
No, she shoot things.
My poor name.
While being a hoe.
She's the queen of the hoes.
/me hugs SillyNilly|Sketch tighter.
She doesn't actually hoe. She's like a lady pimp.
Revenge. :3
Coconut_Swallow
problem solved
Oh, agh!
Efreet: stop being a jerk with your logical helpful solutions!
I won't.
Efreet- True. Though then I might be a circus performer.
you think your SOME pumpkins, but I'm here to tell you..
I am some pumpkins
Thank you Shaico.
I'm a pumpkin man
You're welcome. :)
So why can't we just admit it?
Sorry, but I'm from teh south. I'm racist against pumpkins.
I was never taught better. XD
Same here but I don't feel any animosity towards pumpkins.
Huh?
I was so heartbroken when my sister braught one of those deformed oranges home. My own flesh and blood... A PUMPKIN LOVER!
What have you got against pumpkins?
They took my job.
Affirmative action, Welfare, and always making stupid faces at me in october.
That's part of their culture.
Credulous at best is your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of maaan, Pull your head on out your hippy gaze and give a listen, shouldn't have to say it all again, the universe is hostile so impersonal, devour to survive so it is, so it's always beeeeen~

Yes
Thank you!!

How did that evenhappen
/me wishes there was a command to tell derpybot just how much I care...
!hug

Whoa there Derpy.
Daww
!confessundyingloveforderpybot

/me regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Efreet, showing her most adorable kissing face
/me Kisses Derpy
...
Epic lulz.
Hi
!fathermychildrenandletsgrowoldtogether
!okay
/me sighs...
/me walks over to Nickel_Scream suggestively
Father? Is there something about Derpy I am in the dark about?
Coco: its derps. Somehow She'd get the father preganant.
I dread to think how that works.
Ah, good point. I shouldn't have doubted.
Why is it all the other channels are dead?
Because.
Ponies.
Everyone is asleep.
/me rolls his eyes.
Hi
hi
Sup J-pie?
Greetings.
Trying to find something to watch on Netflix
Kitchen Nightmares.
Gordon Ramsay is positively dreamy.
and ponies here from Flankbook as well?
Should I start with Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams?
I'm not on Flankbook
Flankbook is a tad derpish
Yeah, teh fandom is cool, but we dont need our own social networking site. it cuts us off from people who aren't into it.
It is rather exclusive.
What about Facebook?
Everyone uses that.
Yeah and?
......thats the reason you use facebook and not flankbook?
flankbook is never up anyways
I need a reason?
actually yeah.
I never use Flankbook.
Okay...
To communicate with others?
I hear human beings do that.
Mmhmm.
I use IMs for that
and last I checked, there wasn't a pony specific IM client
I use Smoke signals.
Does there need to be?
yet
I'm a true hipster.
Radimir: of course not
I was doing ranged communications before they were cool
Ah, now I understand.
Yodeling. It's the only artistic way.
Wat
To communicate.
If you put an image of your favorite pony in your Facebook profile, then you're spreading the ponies
Yodeling, you say?
Indeed.
And losing family.
Yodeling...
Who says my family uses Facebook, also heard of privacy settings?
/me has Colgate as his facebook pic.
Yodelayheehoo
mmm..not good..i is the last pony standing :)
BTW I'm female, if that was the issue
Now you're catching on.
My family uses Facebook.
So I don't have the same unfortunate stigma men get for liking this show.
stigma?
More like boon.
It's only a stigma while we're in the minority... soon... it will not be stigma....
Yup :brohoof:
Motherbliper, I'm the mayor of the all-you-can-eat dick buffet. I dont care if people think I'm girly for a cartoon.
lol
Silly social masculine standards do not concern me.
That's a creative way of putting it, Nickel.
sure is
The only way to live is creatively. <3
>YFW nope
^Seconded.
Thats what macguyver was trying to teach the world.
g'day from downunder
before it started to be rednecky and judge harshfully on others
Good morning from east coast of NA.
Reiko- Macguyver?
Pinkie Pie's method of communication involes hundreds upon thousands of what appears to be random movement, but is actually very precise choreography, detailing every single letter and emotion in her message!
yes
hehe, a very early morning Dashite
:)
Actually a very late night.
I must have missed that. What season did that start in?
Anyone else agree with me on Pinkie Communication?
Yup
Untamed: That may be the best thing humanity has created thus far.
Sums up Pinkie pretty well
oh..no early start for you in the morning then
fdshajl I hate getting stuff caught in my mouth, like hair.
You are forgetting her telepathic powers, however.
ok guys i g2g. cya
I'm trying to decide whether I should just stay up, or go to bed.
Oh right. Her telepathic powers.. I forgot all about them.
Pinkie is just a true mage.
See yah!
She only uses them LONG distances.
*hugs everyone*
i can help with that
She's the "half-rose one"
Pinkie Pie communication protocol makes HTML5 look basic
...stay up and chat to somepony 20000 km away
:D
And if she has an urgent message? She just dons her Karate outfit and breaks down the 4th wall.
I've been scared that she's going to jump out of my screen and berate me when I watch the show.
Give it time
Thanks, FallSilently, I found it and thought I should share n.n
"Pinkie Pie. I'm -right- next to you, What was so urgent you have to break the 4th wall to talk to me?!"
"My Pinkie Senses are tingling. Something's going to fall."
I had a dream that pinkie chewed me out for smoking.
Sounds in character.
so, what does a Dashite do?
That could have multiple meanings o.O
LoL, I just thought what if the Wile E Coyote had like a Pinkie detector that used pinkie language
These days, not much.
He'd probably get it from Acme though, which means it would be fail
i see
untamed: multiple meanings?
He looks for jobs and waits for university to start again.
Pinkie Pie communications are copyrighted by Pinkie Pie. The only place you can get those sorts of communications are from Pinkie Pie Inc.
I sense the word "chew" is about to be keyed on.
/me nods
She ate your hair?!
for smoking?!
oh, then what is you doing the study of?
Yes. I do get the multiple meanings.
Business. Just need to get my HR classes in.
!muffins
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Efreet
!socks
hi
y u no have !socks command, derpy?
Fail Derpy, fail.
Hellew
Quick, Coconutswallow!
What would a !socks command even do?
African or European?!
Imagine if she had a !moon command.
Ikr?
Maybe she does.
!moon
Grab my tail, Efreet!
Okay
Efreet- I am beginning to resent this.
Ow.
The moon was fun to visit.
nice
Five deaths now. Five.
long to go?
Five? Hoh boy
I've had 7 deaths.
Well...I was planning to troll someone who didn't know about the !moon command, but now they all do.
Last year.
5 deaths in what?

Since I've arrived in Equestria Daily, my Death to Kill ration has doubled.

I fell off the Bridge five times this week. It doesn't feel pleasant.
*totally accurate*
Yeah nothing like expressing to people, that this chat is hostile

/me grabs Coconutswallow and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
You don't kill him like that, Johnsey.
/me returns with a cupcake with Coconutswallow's name etched into the frosting
You ask him if he's African or European.
Hi
dang flash crash
Wow, Cupcake reference built right in. Way to go.
14Oh, I have way too much fun with this.
Efreet- Thank you for not positing that question directly at my person.
I've noticed...
AlphaOmega: get a real irc client!
What are you talking about? I can't tell if you're African or European, Please answer.
be right back
african or european unladen swallow?
I think the Bridge is beginning to tire of my patheticness.
Now he's died twice.

Is Coconutswallow an African or European swallow?
night night Octavia

How the fu-
/me launched off the bridge

I will destroy every fibre of your being.

Sorry, I am already incorporeal due to my five deaths this week.

I will destroy ever ecoplasmic fibre of your ecoplasmic being

I'm going to assume you mean sweet and not sweat...
I hear no Ghostbuster's theme song. Your threat is hollow.
I don't need no Ghostbuster's theme song.

I just need to..
Giggle at the ghostly!
Ha. Ha. Ha.
Oh sh----
O_O
*poofs*
so then if Pinkie makes ghosts vanish thats a clear use of turn undead.
I win. Victory is mine.
that too..
:)
Pinkie's a Paladin.
She's all of said classes.
Twilight is a Wizard.
pinkie is not even close to lawful
BS
Flutteryshy is a druid
Rarity is a necromancer.
Pinkie is Chaotic Neutral to the core.
Rarity a necromancer? what!?
Applejack's the fighter.
Yes.
She's a Necromancer.
Necromancer?
Rainbow dash is the Ranger.
Can't you see the evil in her eyes?
Do explain.
She's evil, I tellsya.
Evil.
Riarty isnt evil
She could summon up corpses just by whining.
By the power of Seth!
*rarity
Rarity is Good. We all know it.
Hi
She's totally a Necromancer if her whining can summon zombies and skeletons.
Efreet- Though that is true. Her whining is of unimaginable power.
Twi = Wizard, Rarity = Ranger, Applejack = Fighter, Fluttershy = Druid, Pinkie Pie = barbarian, Rainbow Dash = ???
Hi JackiePie
Necromancers dont wine.
*whine
They brood
BINGO
Hi DeadBarney
Actually I think they hex a lot.
Rainbow Dash is the scout.
She's fast.
But weak.
Lookat her wings.
PAPER.
that's not a DnD base class :P

She's a striker

Efreet- A guy I murdered a few hours ago.

Was he an African or European Swallow?
!kill Sleep
/me grabs Sleep and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
I don't know. I killed him before he could tell me.
/me returns with a cupcake with Sleep's name etched into the frosting
Well then.
That's just mean.
You would have to had you been in my shoes. He'll think twice before he gives be baggy eyes.
Feels like insomnia, woaaahooo!
Bored. No homework to do, now nothing to do.
Coconutswallow- Look at those typos!
i aint board
I thought no homework to do was a good thing.
yah
I thought so also.
lol
But then I realized I spend most of my time on homework.
do de do do do, do de do do
Man FML.
THe last time I had homework..
You have entered, the Twilight Zone.
i go on the computer to much i think
was in year.. 8.
4 years ago.
Where doing homework is fun.
Lucky.
I never did Homework during year 9+, since if you finish your work in class, you don't get homework.
^Proven method.
Howework?
What is this?
In my school, homework means doing work at home, pretty much
.
Fireant- Home improvement perhaps?
i do homework at school
In soviet russia, School does homework
lol
... HAH
Yes.
I just realized I have an essay to finish up!
Brb guys.
and in Australia..
Homework dies due to giant spiders killing it.
What is wrong with my country?!
Alot.
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Efreet
oh yeah, giant spiders. I see them everyday
yes
Efreet- Oh so true.
hahahaha, stolen
Yes. Giant Spiders. Poisonous Trees. Poisonous everything.
Even the air is poison in Australia.
Australian's have 90% poison resistance to the air here.
Wow, sounds like a great place for me to level up.
Non-natives? Sorry, you're outta luck, you have 10% resistance.
I think i know the ecosystem of a country i live in :P
Lol. I usually talk like Australia's eternally in a fight against Nature, Balloons.
I can acquire resistance potions.
Makes me feel like a badass.
I'm a level 147 Australian.
So close to my next advancement.
Whoops, my finger slipped. Always a good trait in someone with POWER.
I'll advance to Super-Australian in 23 levels.
Well i'm vegeterian so i'm level -100 Australian
I grind like a boss.
I really need to get down there. I've outgrown my local grind spots.
Any good guilds down there?
Yeah.
But you have to be Australian to join.
Well surely I can prove myself...? I'll gladly become an Australian proselyte.
Hello
You'd have to fight a level 75 Giant Trapdoor Spider to get in.
Hmm, I might have to train for that one. I might hit up Montana for awhile before I attempt that quest.
Make sure you fill your tucker bag with potions.
hay
Greetings! And already on it Balloons.
Besure to equip your best Armour too.
Otherwise the Spider'll kick your ass hard.
Don't get scammed by the New Zealanders around here.
They only know how to.. make out with Sheep.
/me racism
Buuuurrrrnnnn.
ikr.
I recommend the slouch hat. it has decent damage resistance.
Where's a New Zealander when you need one?
But does it have poison resistance?
It has +25% poison resistance.
If you get a decent one.
Morning erryone.
Hmm, I'll have to keep an eye out for one. Hopefulyl someone's auctioning one.
Morning.

You'd make a great lecturer.

Seriously.

You can dislike them. But never hate.
You can hate maybe Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.

I am also a girl for the record
ok
You know you've set a trend when at 3 AM this happens...
21.8.2011 2:30am - 3:00am was a busy time for #EquestriaDaily - 64 ponies active
Active users during this 30-minute period were (in order of appearance):
	Lunasta, Deadlift, Shaico, Kiacat, rarity, Leonon, HaysforPonies, Whompman9000, Sketchy_Sounds, Rose, Locke, Sharksky, MrMooMoo, Vexed, Firebolt, MrEvergreen, Shiggy, mook, Noryn, Devo, Kein, Sidestroke, BlacklightShining, Lawdee, DerpyBot, Laico, Larity, Libri, LrLooLoo, LacklightShining, Liacat, LShiggy, LightblackShining, LannySwish, DannySwish, Qaico, Qiacat, LbacklightShining, Qunasta, Quidestroke...
I was just trying to guess where DeadBarney is.
Well in some places Jackie is still a male nickname for Jack, so can be kind of confusing.
Good job, you just pinged 64 ponies.
FallSilently: france
Wow, Lunasta. You did not just do that xP
Ah. Close.
Yes, yes I did.
Doesn't matter to me.
/me hugs Lunasta <3
But you were close
Morning Shai :D
What's pinging?
/me hugs Shaico
/me yawns
?
hmm
I'm not active ;_;
Strange.....
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
Ish afternoon for me, but good morning to you as well. :3
/me wraps her front hooves around Firestar778 in a tight embrace
:D
JackiePie: When someone types your name, it should ding.
Mornin
I see
And it did
Why not call it dinging instead of pinging?
Ding bing bong
It's more like a bloop
sounds like a ding to me
It's useful for annoying people like Locke and Shaico.
Depends on your client.
what... another halfop?
Are you calling me annoying, or are you using annoying as a verb?
Muhahahahaaa
This song reminds me of fPhantasy Star Online/Universe
You better not call me annoying, or I will bring the shoe down on you. >:(
I'm using it to annoy people like Locke and Shaico.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrILQFdrDGY&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_656047
If you're on the embed, there's an audible ping. If you're on YChat like me, there's a little popup message from the corner.
this is funny

I need to ask Twilight about that one.
... I don't feel better.
Twilight told me this video is about Darius - Infinite Proxy
/me tries that video with the inception track audio
Hey, no annoying my Shai
/me needs to see Inception because he doesn't understand almost 43% of the current net memes
is alright, if you're here you have the other 57% covered
Not even strutting Leo? :O
I saw Inception. Wasn't too hard to follow.
Not even strutting Leo.
Inception is elementary compared to Donnie Darko.
Hit up Knowyourmeme quick-like!
Donnie was a headwreck.
I'm surprised Donnie Darko hasn't become a meme yet.
*shrugs at Donnie Darko*
Too old.
That movie was masterfully done.
2001.
I am a wizard.
rar
Probably also why there are no X-Files memes. Not. One.
Oh my. I just had an epiphany.
If Google is your friend, and friendship is magic, then Google is magic. Think about it.
Wow, so few of us in here now
And that show had so many great lines.
..
Take this!
My love! My anger! And all of my Sorrow!
Shining finger swooooooooooooord!
Go! Go! Gooooooooo!
*blinks*
I really am a level 10 wixard!
/me stabs Coconutswallow in the head
/me 's dictionary combusts
What would you all do..
*reaches over chalkboard* Lets see, uh that's the sixth time...
hehe, putting that inception track to that rainbow dash video works well. I'm glad it does as i just *bought* the album from itunes to do it
if Pinkie Pie suddenly popped out of your monitor while browsing something pony related.
what would I do about what?
im leaving ill be back in like a half an hour
I would probably die of fright
one quick mkvmerge later, and what goes into my vault has both
bye
Anyhooo, time for me to go applebuck myself some breakfast.
Psh, Pinkie's already done that. She's sitting next to me providing running commentary on my life.
See yiz all later.
She is?
Breakfast sounds like a wonderful idea.
She's doing the same for me!
okyah i want food
So. Coconutswallow. Shall I.. bring your death count up to a lovel 7?
But she can't! She's just for me!
i like food
bye
Efreet- I'll gladly challenge you to a duel over Pinkie Pie's affections.
im back
:D
I shall win this fight, Coconutswallow. For you have to answer me ONE question.. Are you an African or European swallow?
Applejack's hat has an odd habit of turning invisable
Noooooooooo, alas Pinkie....
I am neither
/me takes ownership of Pinkie Pie's affection
Such underhanded tactics are not deserving of her love.
Totally are.
;3
To put it eloquently: Totally are not!
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
yes
/me wraps her front hooves around Coconutswallow in a tight embrace
Totally are. ;D
!hug
1hug
Hugtiem? :3
/me wraps her front hooves around Efreet in a tight embrace
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
Its ok, Derpy still loves me.
/me wraps her front hooves around Firestar778 in a tight embrace
No, Derpy, what are doing?!
*you
What are doing?!
I'm going to make fun of you now.
Heartbroken twice in one night.
What are doing?!?!!?!!
Scootaloo's wings also have an odd habit of turning invisable
It could go right alongside accidentally the whole thing. What are doing Derpy?
i have a question
wut
for u
Shoot.
what do u think ur cutie mark would be
Balloons!
areyouanafricanoreuropeanswallow
But Pinkie Pie has that cutie mark, Balloons.
Sorry.
Sorry to..
/me glasses
It would be a skull and crossbones apparently.
yah
Burst your bubbles
mine ould be
I know, it is actually the sun. Since i am Celestia.
a needle and thred
or something
something to do with fashion
I have no idea what my cutie mark would be.. Probably a Shield or something. Lol :V
Balloons - I think that's grounds for banishment.
only one pony can have ballon marks?
I'd like a cutie mark of a cutie mark. Think of the inception jokes!
Banishment you say?
considering there's at least ten different apple ones
andlots of hourglasses
What would a pony's cutie mark be if they're protective of their frien- oh god, runnnn
Suddenly the Luna Republic is looking particularly nice this morning.
/me flees from Celestia
?!?!
Ohhhhhh
and it's all wrong anyway as it ought to be a fobwatch for doctor whooves
I'd probably have a computer mouse or something, idk.
It's Princess Celestia WOOT!
..
maybe a dagger due to all the mafia games I play
I'm surprised nopony has Luna.
yah
You may find yourself going unidentified soon.
..
orly?
Anywho....
Yay, I found some leftover meatballs
Castle Bravo......
15 Megatons.......
Yay!
*cough*
hay i just thought of another question
?
ooh reminds me, got some venison meatballs in fridge
ok here it gose
haven't tried yet
Why does Rainbow Dash always seem to crash in the most conveint places
Cutie Mark Crusaders Nuclear Powers YAY!
bambiburgers are nice though
what type of pony wdo u think you would be
Gasp!
Rainbow Dash has a special ability beside the Sonic Rainboom.
It's called
inb4 a hell of a lot of Alicorns
Nuclear powers!
"Convience."
NUKES!
I leave for five seconds and the CMC is starting nuclear warfare?
I'd probably would be an Earth Pony. As Efreet, I'd be a Unicorn.
Well, my avatar on the stats page is an alicorn
Maybe it will earn them their cutie mark.
They must be good at Modern Warfare two
my oc piony is a unicorn
so i will go with that
Cutie Mark Crusader Superheroes, YAY!
My YouTube links on the stats page have any of you seen it yet?!
Pegusai because FLYING would be amazing
Both my characters are pegasi
hmm
Which is weird considering I always play the black mage
I've been to your channel Nuc. Nice stuff you have there, very clear.
Superheroes? "Scootaloo you saved me! Oh thank yo- where did that tree sap come from?!"
LOL
Ah thanks Lunasta!
How do we keep getting covered in treesap?!
With all the tree sap they keep getting stuck in, maybe they should be making maple syrup.
Nuclear, does the YT page you linked contain footage of nuclear testings?
Yes
I like it.
Thanks
JackiePie - That's the logical step.
Noocleeah
Noocleeah
i did like the little detail in the running of the leaves where it shows the ponies do actually tap for tree sap. nice little world detail
?
Must be one of those things you really have to look for.
Wut. I'm just saying Noocleeah.
Oh yeah
Noo c leeah? What did Leeah do?
when they're running through the trees, you see these buckets and spout things attached to some of them
That's how they pronounce it these days lol!
Raelcun
Everything.
I say Nuclear as Newclear.
rachel - Details were one of the things that endeared me to the show.
i spotted them first time and didn't spot derpy until like the third watch-through
Noocklear, Newclear. Both accepted pronunciations.
I only got into Ponies thanks to a certain Brony here.
I have a sort of bad habit watching shows while playing Pixie Hollow, so I'm not really watching it per say.
Though he's being silent :C
Derpy?
no
Yep it really doesn't matter how you say it just as long as you know what your talking about.
Hey.
Coconutswallow.
Oh, well I hazarded a guess. Excuse me if it was outlandish...
Guess what!
thought it was the other way around :-P
And this smartphone keypad is really slow...
Oh well....
comeonguess
Uh-oh, what am I guessing per chance?
I dunno. You'll have to guess it!
African
.. no
Do you like bananas Efreet?
Yes.
But that is completely irrelevant to..
here we go again
Oh no....
Pinkie Pie is right behind you Coconutswallow.
SHES AN EVIL ENCHANTIRES SHE DIOSE EVILE DANES WHEN U LOOK DEEP IN HER EYE SHE PUT U IN TRANCES
She's returned to me!
WOW BAD TYPEING
Not the bananas!
then you know what she'll do? She'll put you in a stew, and eat you!
poo
Look out!
She does eveil Danes? oh no!
lol
Anyone have pony dubstep for me?
She's not returning to you, Coconut.
hey is anypony here familiar with PonyChan?
Yeah sort of
She's going to tell you that she wishes to draw on your face.
While I wait for my essay to print, how are you guys?
How are you guys doing? ;3
can you explain the tripcodes to me? i read the FQ but i'm still confused...
I thought we were talking about Pinkie Pie, not Jigglypuff.
ik the evile enchantris song by hart
Efreet - Draw?
i mean evil
Yes.
Draw.
Shaico: Good thanks. Bit of a headache but i'll manage. Yourself?
That might explain the sharp implement she's holding...
if they're like 4chan, tripcodes are to secure a name so people know it's you they're talking to
and how do i put one in my name when posting?
! followed by a word. It then gets scrambled into random text.
IIRC, haven't been on 4chan in ages
really? so in the Name field: AppleDashWINS![word]
Intel Core i7 2600K, ATi Radeon HD 6970, LGA1155 MOBO, 500GB 15,000RPM HDD, 8GB DDR3-1333, HAF 932 Chassis, Zalman Fansinks, Windows 7 Ultimate x64 edition, and a 1600Watt PSU, all for under $2,000 I MUST HAVE IT NAO!
Damnit this T7500 cannot keep up anymore :'(
So much techno babble :O
Core i7 is kind of overkill...
I need it to
Emulate a XBOX at the low level....
I think. May want to put a space between you name and the tripcode, though.
oh ok thanks
And 8 GB? What are you planning on running on that thing?
np
everything.
Uh I was going to use it for
3D rendering!
Maya and 3DSMax
You should have some nuclear powered weasels.
And suddenly it all becomes legit.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMhHA5a6v8 I'm hyped as buck now
I want to make me some PSVita games homebrew....

It was an 80's pop song.

Haha, I know.

Oh god LittleKuriboh is a genius sometimes
Leather Pants?
Hmmmm

Photo Finish is a Gaga pony
that vid was so awkward.... lol
"Shut up, I am Lady Gaga!"
Radiological/Biological/Chemical symbol........
"I like these funny noises!"
Awkward or no, it was pure win.
Ahhh that would make a great symbol!
Yes
I think Dash already claimed that.
My Special talent involves eggs.
What I do with the eggs is purely secret.
Pics or didn't happen.

Efreet - So you special talent is being the Pyro?
Yes.
Legit.

My special talent is...ugh, I probably don't have one. Maybe VAing if I get good at it?
VAing?
Arrrrggghhhh
Voice Acting
I'm guessing.
That is a really cool Pony Efreet!
ja
Oh, I wanted to voice act but all I can do well is a voice that sounds like Yoshi from Super Mario.
Thanks, Nuclear.
;D
if only my normal voice wasn't so inherently awful and I didn't have to contort it, it would be so much better.
I also can do a pretty good imitation of Beavis
Welcome
Arrrrghhhhghghghgg.

Can someone check if Lonesome Road's received a release date yet?
Ohai GGgala.
Lonesome Road?
ohai dari

Oh, DLC?
Now that is strange.
Yeah
I had that exact same sentence in my head.
You mean for Fallout: New Vegas?
I just didn't type it.
O__o
Oh, I also have been able to imitate The Arborians from Chowder pretty well.
I'd look it up. But I can't. And yes.
Not that it's that hard, lol.

Oh
Efreet - Somet vague as of yet not said time in September.

takes forever to pull off a new voice though because I've got the accent barrier to overtake.
That's cool I'll just try to get both then :)
Right. Still the same thing. God damn it Obsidian/Bethesda.

Use !link by itself and Derpybot'll cough up a random one.
Oops, repeated.

Use something like !link Derpy and she'll find something with Derpy.

Twilight told me this picture is about artist:PixelKitties parody 300 guard_pony fluttershy
and by the end of S2, it'll probably be up to 2 days per mil
oh
it'll be like that at the start
You mean 2 mil per day? x3
2 million per second.
2 million wut?
10 million in 10 seconds flat
over 9000?
Pony is that good.
Combo reference joke!
Well at least it's helped a lot of people find friends.
especially having been stopped for more than three months. that'd normally kill something going like this
it's honestly unlike anything I've seen before, and I've followed the Pokemon fanbase for over a decade
Friends? Who needs friends? I have ponies. Keep your "friends."
O_O
friends are fine too
and homestuck for about a year
Hey, that's what the show was all about. Making friends.
Yep
Following coconuts.... you can take your logic as well
I do love how things like this connect people, though. It's pretty impressive, if you think about it.
Speaking of coconuts, coconut water is good.
Poooooniiesss..
poniesponiesponiesponiesponiesponies
While MLP is my favourite TV show, it doesn't replace real friends for me. :P
Aura - This fandom has been one of the best connectors I've ever been a part of.
I dunno about MLP helping me make friends.
Had plenty before MLP.
But it sure helped me a better person.
Heh, here's hoping the same for me I guess
>dress my pony up in Flash outfit on the pony creator
I am now god.
Shaico - Then the challenge lies in converting them.
brb
I already converted a few.
Few being two.
and what with derpymail, rainbowdash network, ponychan, pooniboru, flankbook, and all that, i bet if someone wanted to their entire online presense could be in the ponyrealm of the internet, hahaha
The quest isn't over until it's ALL of them.
I've converted none.
For I have no friends.
:(
I have on friend that loves Top Gear.
Indeed Shai, I'm making all my resolutions PONIES OR BUST.
I've half-converted one. I'm trying my darndest on the rest.
And I mean obsessed.
And he saw Top Gear's post on their website.
I would show people the show if I wasn't so damn scared to reveal that I was a brony
He's currently in denial.
Everytime I search the internet.... I usually wind up at ponies along some point in the time frame
I am a bit, still.
yea, telling people is one of the hardest things about being a brony
Aura, ditto. Though my neighborhood isn't the most... modern as it is.
The key is to break whatever preconceptions about what is "cool" society has instilled upon them. /psychspeak
I've told exactly one person and that was only because I knew he was a brony anyway
Lunasta, why you don't love me?
WHY?
Fireant.
I love you.
Well that's one person, Firant.
*Fireant
12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
/me steps on Fireant
Trololo.
efreet i want to kill you
Efreet, sorry hun, but I don't know you long enough to love you back.
Yes, but I haven't noticed a single person try to even drop hints of ponies, while I hum/whistle a lot of the songs crossing campus.
But Lunasta...
A good friend is not one who judges you baased on a Television show you watch.
:P
Nein Fireant!
...why do you even act like it's something to tell them? it's just a 'oh what's your favourite tv shows?' 'i like MLP' sort of thing. noone really ought to care all that much.
Look!
ITs the moon!
INB4 kick
Seconds Balloons
LOL
:P
:<
Lunasta, are youe even a girl? xD
Welp, gotta go fix up for school and stuff.
So, Fireant. Are you going to do that HolyGrail crossover, for great justice?
It's more of my current situation, but let's just leave it at I honestly don't know how people would react
I'm a guy....
/me facehoofs
Sure Efreet.
Lunasta, still I love you.
LOVE ME BACK.
Or else... :p
bye Luna
Aura - I guess I can see where you're coming from. That's something I never really had to think about. I've already obssively liked weird things long before MLP became my show. :P
Maybe if I see something different when I get back ;O
I can't wait for it. Srs. I should be able to watch the movies tomorrow. ;V
I have
Movie, I mean.
as well
Anyhoo, getting ready for school
what movie?
Well, I'm off to bed
Fireant, I love you. Does that matter? :3
as mentioned, Pokemon's been a part of my like for over a decade and people generally associate me of one of three things
No Shaico.
I could be your Father Shaico.
Good night everyone
So no.
Okay then.
Nope ever.
xD
goodnight untaimed
'the tall one', 'the smart one' (unjustified but oh well), or 'that guy that plays pokemon'
I'd say the step from Pokemon to Ponies shouldn't be a big one. Or at least, I don't consider it one.
It is.
iluvuShaico ;D
I never was a Pokemon.
Ponies shouldn't call it weird. It is harmless enjoyment watching a show that teaches good morals. There are a lot weirder things out there in the world.
/me hugs Shaico
Yet now I am a pony.
Yay at least one pony loves me. :)
/me hugs Lunasta.
Pokemon, believe it or not, is somewhat socially acceptable at my school
Also, I shall minimise this window so my cat causes no more problems
ah, you're in school, that's why, hahaha.
My school does not have the stereotypical popular kids rule.
!moon Untamed's cat
as in, pretty much everyone plays it for some reason. Mainly because it's one of the few things that runs on the computers well
Grab my tail, Untamed's cat!
If you're not popular, then there's probably a reason that is your fault.
I want to hug a pony >_> I dunno If I should be sharing this info amunst people or not.... but... whichever
xD
i'm a farmer. my friends are farmers; they don't care asside from finding it mildly amusing, :P
To be popular = be nice and don't be excessively weird.
Really? I haven't really paid attention to Pokemon's social status lately. I can say that having Pokemon be more acceptable than MLP is rather... non-sensical.
I don't give a damn about popularity, but I'm excessively weird anyways so lol
wierd is the shit
Shaico: I can't be popular in that case
I am very popular.
As I said, it's more of acceptable because it's one of the few things that people can play on the computers
In my part, I am like The Fonz.
Have you tried hiding your weirdness? :3
I always do that.
!link
no
http://fav.me/d43gp1r
Weirdness should totally be shown to all.
Nope. Weirdness is my way of saying I'm not part of the crowd
Shaico: I hate doing that... makes me feel boring
'Tis more amusing on the part of the person being weird.
weirdness is who you are
Learning_with_Lunasta: to be a part of the crowd that is not a part of the crowd
If being weird makes you feel special...
:\
I'm a hipster.
im a thingy
I'm an individual,within a group of individuals.
Individualception
And now we get into relativity. Yay...
so...you're unique...just like everyone else...
No, I'm just generally weird as a person. People accept it, move on.
DUN DUN DUN
So.
Aura, i can respect that.
and that's what annoys me
One could say you're weird but that's just because everyone is different. They live different lives, and grew up differently.
Everypony.
Let us discuss an important topic.
Twilight Sparkle.
Apparently.... I'm supposedly the most awesome person in my class... People occasionally tell me this... But never show it
No matter how strange I've acted beforehand, people have accepted me
why should it be different with this?
yet somehow it is
y u no discuss twilight sparkle
:(
Aura - As they should (well, barring dangerous behavior lol).
they'll only react badly if you obsess over it.
^
Efreet - Make it Trixie and we have deal.
Fine.
Let us discuss..
Which I probably will, knowing me
The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie.
She is a scam!
A scam I tells you.
i'm sure twi had popularity complexes as well
Why is Trixie so popular?
trixie is overrated
She sucks. :P
She's like Luna.
Take ALL of that back! All of you!
nope.avi
no!
I'll be interested if she re-appears in season 2
*grumble*
Trixie is a balloon. She's full of hot gas.
I think being different shouldn't really be noticed by yourself.
.avi
All this blasphemy. Trixie is awesome!
>INB4 hated for basing opinions just on canon information
Don't drag luna into this...
If you start to try to be different, then you should really stop.
she seems one-off, but if Derpy's a character now then Trixie might be too.
But that's my opinion, so I dunno
well I think it's important to have restraint
i hope not, i'm looking forward to a whole new list of one-off characters
not to many though
I would "^" but your comment isn't above mine, Aura.
I hope alot of the Background ponies get some episodes..
.-.
Like..
GILDA
hopefully
Orion :D
Gilda?
Gilda.
Gilda, yes.

There will be more one-off characters

THIS is how you do it! take the game and make it soooo much better. now the show is ... so long ... drags on so much nowadays.
But then again I was wondering if a wireless stun gun would be better.....
Yeah but you know it's cool, if someone who knows nothing about knives, thinks it's cool.
I only saw parts of season 1, but it really added to pokemon R/B/Y. aniways, while I was aware of EV/EPs and IVs, I never got that into the games, and I haven't played one since the gba generation 3.

it goes into ridiculous detal
He deliberately leaves weak blocks in his cells so that prisoners can spend their time digging through them with their spoons. Behind the weak block is a new spoon.
Would Moonbase Alpha be like Epcot Center?
lawl i missed that one
hmm...
Speaking of the moon, I'm watching the movie, "Moon," right now. Absolutely fantastic flick.
i only know the theory where Ash is still in a coma after the first episode, and hallucinated the rest of the series
