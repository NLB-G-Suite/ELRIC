Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba is the best name ever.

10it's gonna make ponies go BOOM
wat?
/me hides in the curve of the room, too
my brain is full of WoW
/me 10gambled that it's nerimon, anyway, now checking EqD
10simplez
5naptiem, then moar artmkaing
10yeah, called it
Welp, you were right.
mfw when I was three weeks ahead of when ponies became poplar
This is strange.
O_o
XD
10I mean, that's why I'm subbed to him, right?
10oh, one of his most popular series of videos
10and talked about it, and took the piss out of it, I guess
dat quality
LOL
Already wants a Fluttershy toy.
Wow.
10So good
My sister told me about him I think.
10Charlie and Nerimon are buddies, roomies
10and then soon after, nerimon was making videos too
10I told you, obsessed fans ;)
XD
Never heard of him.
Okay...
ugh, sxephil
10meh
:P
Especially all the people on it.
10I've been with it since the beginning, it's the easiest way to get SC2 videos and shit all in one place
10at least, that's one of the main reasons I still use it
10btw, sxephil has "Total Upload Views:656,220,672", "Subscribers:1,786,303"
I came exactly 7 times while watching it.
Meh.
10jeez
Well that's the first time through
These types of videos don't interest me.
10You shouldn't
10but if it's -entertaining- then you can choose to watch it for entertainment
You mean the retarded meme comments or the argument comments?
I'm sure those retarded meme comments are chan people.
OH man thast reminds
me
Well, both, though mostly the latter...
anyone see the 4chan referance in deux ex?
Haven't been to 4chan since... approximately the dawn of time

Moths are cute.
10NO
NO
And nice.
Like bees.
NOT THE BEES
I hate moths
10Bees are great
10Bees are fucking nice
well, I was wondering when dari usually streams
Well tarantulas are cute.
10moths want to fucking kill you

Moths.

GTFO
10NO U

The first rule of BMN is... everypony came.
the second? first rule but applied to SilverMane
lol
and lol...get this
Hah, I'd vote for that
Lol.
tell me if you think the idea is stupid or not, because I'm seriously debating making it my next fic
the obly problem is getting everypony's personalities and appearances down
Hmmm, yeah, that could be a lot of work.
in which case I'd have to get an appearance and brief bio on ppl that would want in on it
Yep.
10like, 1st person or 3rd, and if 1st person, then whose perspective?
it would have to be from 3rd, to avoid my natural bias
I'd vote for either 3rd person or ReticentSmolder's perspective.
lol, I guess 3rd then :P
10but Ret you could take it to an extreme, and make it from the perspective of ret, actually writing some kind of report on BMN
10so, sat in the corner writing, but about BMN
I've never written satire before, which makes me nervous but also kind of excited
10but make it all immersive and junk
10brb checking oven
haha, I could be a 'newcomer'

Haha, oh yeah

its good isn't it Daz?
ohey Sathi

That fail is mind-blowing...

something streaming
Well, not all 7 billion people of earth are huge idiots...
Think about how stupid the average person is.
Now realize that half the population is stupider than that.
and some of the other half is still only that
Yeah I've heard it before :P
Although
example from not 2 hours ago:
I'm nowadays more inclined to believe that ignorance truly is bliss
I just don't buy it. I mean global riots? I could see that happening, given the right circumstances.
i was watching riddick with my father, and in english, and he keeps telling me some scenes aren't in the spanish version. mfw it's on same dvd. mfw it's just an audio change. mffw
Lol
Haha
actually:
example from 20 mins ago (i was at cornershop)
10dman implying britain isn't horribly dumb too XD
Every country is horribly dumb, but there's a difference between crowds and individuals.
i promise you this just happened 20 mins ago
Well
with his ridiculous spanish accent, mispronouncing about half the alphabet
No, he's giving you a discount of .29 for buying more than one
See here's the thing though
I generally like people, just not people when they're in crowds...
About 50% unpacked
In america
I hear a chair squeaking and a printer printing
Buy two for only $5!
well, i'm sure we can agree that in most places people are idiots
And they get away with it.
[18:12] <RainBroDash> dariiii you streaming anything good?
Nah
I'm leaving.
10kk
later dari
Bye.
good luck in Town
Ones that don't pay attention to prices at least.
I didn't take them up on the offer, though.
actually, I have a quote
Pretty much
(a khakis is a military uniform made of khaki fabric)
from the same song: "deliver me from swedish furniture"
lol ikea
Lol
Isn't that from Fight Club, though?
I saw a comic the other day, Ikea Job Interview
Boss is sitting on his chair and the person being interviewed is presented with a screwdriver and a disassembled chair
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpqObhK4Rw
lol I like IKEA
Hey, i have a lot of ikea furniture
it's probably the best place to get furniture
but i wouldn't buy something because it 'looks cool.' in fact, my house is pretty bare of furniture
Well, no.
(i can upload pics if u want)
Well, yes
I have 8 ponies right here, they're pretty cool!
>8
You didn't tell me this!
i must know!
which ones you have now? :P
Oh I'm counting the molded ones, Daz
Might get more next month :P
I heard that we'll like... officially start switching to G4 then, here
presumably because S1 premieres in Swedish soon...
Me neither, I'm pretty sure it's gonna air on Cartoon Network here
o wait
which is good, it has an english language track on DTV
in north of spain there's cartoon network, but below madrid there's no cartoon network
and i'm south spain. sigh. i hope it's either available here somechannelelse, or it's uploaded to the interwebs
Going to split it up into 6-8 times as many curls as the guide suggests :P
where is our interviewee?
lol I dunno if it's a GOOD plan, though
also: i've got something planned for Daisy Dreams, as her hairstyle isn't actually a colourswap
but yeah, the 3 curl plan didn't work for me... at all
haha :D
I hope they include the extra G4 brushables as background ponies in S2
...:O!!!!
i just imagined my room with every inch covered in UNIQUE ponies :3
it was glorious
i know right!
hope it happens
Townie?

oh okay
and where'd you find FiM font? :O
It demonstrates how people react to Warhammer being called a Warcraft Rip-Off (which it ISN'T. Warcraft would've been warhammer if GW had given their ip license to Blizzard)

just a leetle bit
Probably
It's hard to get perfection, though

Ooooh.
8penn state's mascot is the nittany lions
This could be why.
8his name is a play on the mascot
But it could be why for both. ;)
@Additional_Pylones the amount we need
oops. my bad.
Okay.
But that was just my little theory.
@Additional_Pylonsmeter the amount we need
10I think he'll be fine either way, because of his experience
6 the amount we need is 84% Additional_Pylons. (199)
4It's not about thinking like a viewer, you gotta think like a mod
8well, i was leaning towards hire until he went down in flames on the pictures
I know this.l
10I still think hire
12After clarification.
suddenly roof leaks
Bewm.Headshot.
8>not even kick for 4
Thousands of them?
7i'm a bit on the fence
4I'm not sure
4I'm also on the fence
man, she really /did/ need that roof repaired
7he blew the imagetest up
3Hmmm.....Well....not that i have a say in this....
I'm neautral
Pony limbs grow back.

dat pun
4I'm all for making him more of a coder than anything
3But he kinda gave minimal on the actual info, basically giving just technical skills
:0
that's Trixie
the supporting character in Band of Brothers
8his reasoning for 2 was because it "got a reaction out of him"
8thats not how mods should be acting
12I'm leaning towards no, at least for moderating. Just my opinion. He doesn't seem to have the right attitude for it.
8^
Oh my
3He also only listed technical skills Hipster_Brony
Nope.avi
7i'm leaning towards a no
wait a minute...
shank!
3Me too, although I realize I have 0% say in this.
HE IS THE SUPPORTING CHARACTER FROM BAND OF BROTHERS
8nope.avi
4I say make him a coder
7coder yes
7mod no
8you have say in this DE
OMG <3
4Right, just make him a coder. Not actually a mod, just a coder
3Octy?
8problem is here
I'm in Band of Brothers?
Tru
Hmm?
4Tiger doesn't have the mentality of a mod, but I think we should try him as a coder (has said this like three times already :P)
8he said he doesnt know html coding yet, just that he's learning
HE FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II
lol
5sensemaking, he has it
12If he's just learning, than a no altogether might be best. We can keep looking, we shouldn't settle.
8well, i dont know if i want an inexperienced coder working on the site
5gona lay down for a while
why not?
Thats a shortened version of "Octavia" DE :P
8we might end up with all kinds of bugs
5bai guise
HAHA
3OOOOOHHH
"blow out a candle without using her..."

*BIG
4That sounded awfully nerdy of you
lol
7dat copy paste
Just the way I like it
8like i said, from the site
4Bah, I completely missed the "from the site" bit
12Copypasta aside, are we agreed then?
WAAAAAAAAAH
8i think a no is pretty unanimous
4Alright, no it is
10ok :)
7for the record do vote on the forums :P
8k
8is the poll up yet?
CURSE YOU WRITERS FOR MAKING HIM EASY TO HATE

UP TO ELEVEN
12And season 2!
4I'd say we're getting close to our goal: Season 2
4That's right
4Seth sees us as the primary stream
10so good:)
0This is a great episode, though.
4Well, I'm not surprised in the least that there are competitors popping up
0lol
Well, of course not.
Its a fun thing to do.
12We have the organization, set-up, precedence, PR... I think we're it.
And many can easily enough do it.
0inb4 there's a rainbow mod
Trying to think.
10also having an established 200 viewer count is a plus
0lol I have no idea
0Oh, I was close. :P
And soooo many Synchtubes.
he was faking it
I'm wondering.
10well synchtube can't do anything for livestreaming
10for a start
Doubt it though.
4Seth denotes us as primary streamer
/me 8feels arrogant
7So tomorrow last 2 interviews
lol
3 2 more eh?
Heh
8might be helpful
Go ahead, talk to his superior. :p
4Well, DE, you're a mod
4It means that you're a positive to us
3Aaaaannnnndddd...I am a frequent paneller on thebronyshow.
oh that camera cut
I got nothin',so.....Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba!
4@CB: To be fair, I don't know how structured the other streams are.
4But I'm also inclined to believe that we're definitely ahead of the curve
/me 12has scoped out the competition. He knows we are.
0lolol
Lets just not jinx ourselves by getting too proud. :D
7we are awesome
4True
0it's weird that only a few decades ago, tuberculosis basically meant you'd die
7so many ideas
7so many projects to finish
7we're all gonna be busy
12Eh, w/e. Might as well get pumped about it and do our best.
4However, Sath's right
7and...so little time
O rly?
3Well...what I heard on skype pretty much sounded like everything
7i'm old :D

0EqD's active tonight.
4But mostly Whelp and amonisis
10well nah, it's an imageboard through and through. Just with very active mods and a forum-type 'clique and social dynamic' thing going on
8how can you hate moony?!
12>also has problems with Moony and Amonisis, but not Whelp
8so?
8to each their own
4Therefore, I'm not gonna rag him too much because we've spoken before
:D
8you basically are saying you dont like him because he's nice
4And we have come to respect one another
12Agree heartily, let others be as they wish, it's their choice, as it is our choice to like or dislike them.
4What I'm saying is that I didn't believe his niceness
4He comes off like a bad tumor from the sugar that Ponychan has
8i thik it was mewball
4But I actually believe that he believes it now
4I believe in his niceness now
3What we talkin' 'bout?
8ponychan
4Czarnival
0does anyone else think those incredibly specialised one-way hospital appliances are really cool?
4For Czarina
8that czarnival was RIDICULOUS
12The enitre chan was overrun with Czarina Wreath appreciation and birthday threads made by Moony.
4Please tell me you didn't make the thread, CB
4Okay, good
12I didn't, it was all moony, but I fought it in /meta/ to no avail.
12If it was anyone else, they would have said no.
8i was gone for that entire thread
12The community that is.
>mfw PK is talking in episode 18 of the Bronyville podcast
0PK?
8although a single birthday thread is fine to me
12I agree, but I still like birthday threads.
Author
12Just one though.
4In that case, we should hold birthday threads for every poster
Antipodes
12If you want.
12I don't mind. Someone just has to make them.
0ah, fic author
4Therefore, it should NEVER be made
0lolol
10^
4It's not fair that we hold a birthday thread for just one poster
8usually people make them for themselves
ung..
12There's nothing wrong with a little sweetness. And they're much rarer than you think.
8i made one for myself, mostly as an excuse to make a decently interesting thread
4I still think it's not fair that a couple people can have appreciation threads and no one else can
8cuz /chat/ was boring that day
0Cameron is 100% POMF
12I don't agree with appreciation threads at all.
4But you made one
4For a friend, sure
4But you still made one
7Shows over for today / Tomorrow the next 4
12It was a birthday thread. Difference.
awwwwww
8the appreciation threads are silly and pointlessly divisive
4Are you sure?
alrighty, cya Sathi, I guess.
0Thank you for streaming, Sathi <3
4I was seeing an awful lot of praise for Soldier in that thread
7might be streaming something else though
as always, tyvm sathi
8birthday threads are just a celebration of that persons birthday and an excuse to have fun
7any requests?
oh
hmmmmmmm
that traffic cone
I want the cone back
0vlc
0tempted to say sea ponies
8is it not normal to compliment people on their brithdays now?
KILL IT
stream the cone
Do it
7first a reload
Call upon the sea ponies. I'll get a harpoon!
....cone...
They call him Nittany...
Hello everypony what's up
Hi.
Sathi killed cone
hello taliesin
4People actually know Soldier on there, it's something that I still don't agree with
0hey Taliesin
but otherwise going well
Yo wassup :3
0hi Taliesin
that's nice.
4And besides, if you make a birthday thread and not expect to be showered with praise than you've got something loose in the head
alright
name it
i'll look if it's available :)
0lol just as well
4Really?
12And he doesn't write textwalls anymore.
though I haven't tried magnet in a while.
4Even though you said it was sarcasm
I should just keep a list for times when you take suggestions >.<
12I told everyone to write spoof textwalls in a kind of loving parody.
oh no
8i hold soldier in high regards because i respect him and he's a good friend, nothing wrong with that
OH NO
NO!
4I guess my main problem with Soldier's position at the time was that we were putting select persons on pedestals. Ponychan was becoming this place where if you didn't have a select tripcode or name then you weren't accepted
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
0yay
4And levels of appreciation differed
oh
my
enjoy the stream :P
4>gold
0This is G3.5
G3.5?! NO, IT CAN'T BE!
3.5?
0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
WATCHING THIS IS WORSE THAN CHILD BIRTH
RUNN
NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE!
8but you were essentially blaming soldier for something that everyone but him was doing
FUCK
4I don't deny that now
8namely, deifying him
4But he was the face that I could pin the problems on
WHY DO I NEED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE
4So, naturally, like any angry person I ranted at him
Watching the "Strictly for girls and no-pony else" ponies?
"Twinkle Wish Adventure". oh Celestia just kill me now
12He did talk it out with you though.
4I see now that Soldier was just a minor consequence of a much larger problem on Ponychan
these voice actors are terrible
4Yeah, he did
4I gained respect for Soldier that day
me first herospirit
please
4Ironically, it was the same thread where I completely came to hate Whelp
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
0That voice....

4I had the same feeling a couple nights back when we discovered Season 2 was coming the 17th
10implying it's not riddled with really really silly social dynamics that take more effort than they are worth
0uh... okay
10just my opinion, I don't expect you to share it :P
...lawl, Reticent
10LOL

14KISSOMS ARE A COMING
the 80s were really not good to Americans...that much I can plainly see
0and that's saying something
4As I said, I used to really try to voice my concerns about the state Ponychan was in right before I left
14Pasta power!

Ok.How's about we play some requests after this?Just a suggestion.
7already am
0thing is, that WAS a request
7just shows and series
like a bawss
8there always needs to be dissenting opinions to prevent groupthink
4And we both have noted that and are terrified by it
8its how those opinons are expressed that causes friction
0>bird
4The notion that Cyber and I are like you and Hip but with different philosophies
...it's a hat
/me 10is alone
4We also finished each other's sentences once...it didn't go well
Brb,gotta take a bath.

why have I never heard of it?
YES!
7yes there was
4It's hilarious
YES THERE WAS!
0let's watch it

0somehow, I doubt it...
like...what's the premise?
DAT TIAMAT
You'll see.
4Well, yeah

8right, some people dont
12feelsbadpony.png
14Oh wait
They don't know nothing to their bestiaries
14I think I remember hearing about this very vaguely way way back
Sorta.
4I don't dislike him as much as Cyber though
4Not trying to be polite
10Also, in a public forum
12I've only known post season ponychan, probably why I'm okay with its faults.
I realize why I never heard of this show
HFW
...no redeeming features
not bothered by this?
8cuz he told me yesterday he was convinced no one on the site liked him
10If you want to only get positive responses, don't post a cheer-up thread on an imageboard. lol.
4Haha
WAT

8imo he should have just stayed out of the thread
@roll 100

"I'll stop you He man!" *shoots the wall instead*
Is this... is this fantasy or sci-fi, why can't they decide
0Why do they have to?
i... think it just qualifies as... worst acid trip ever
0Hand holding? In my 80's boy television?
is Skeletor a skeleton in a suit, or a creature with a skull for a face
YOU BOOB!
0he has two layers of costumes
7eagle girl!
0I believe he has no flesh anywhere on his head
7how stoned is he?
I hate to say it everyone
very.
but this show is less Manly than My Little Pony
i think G 3.5 was manlier than this
7:D
7I knew you all loved it
0It's not unmanly, it was the 80's
because naturally FiM is manlier than everything :P
YOU MUST ALL TOUCH IT.
DONT THINK ABOUT IT, YOU MUST ALL TOUCH IT.
7you sure?
7I put it on!

0Skellator's voice reminds me of the Monarch!
0*twinkle*
0That's been bothering me this whole time
only one step between orbs and comets
that laughter...
they laugh at Orco's suffering!
Oh no
7and that's how Equestria was made
0oh wow, that's deliciously bad
0Today I learned that even if you don't do well the first time, that doesn't mean you should give up.
You promised manly Sathi! D:
0YAY
PPG!
0OSHIT
MFW
powerpuff! ultimate manliness
Craig McCracken?

THIS IS ONLY PRO WRESTLER LEVEL MANLY
0inb4 PPG reference/ponified cameo in S2

HEELLLLLLL YEAH

0Sathi, please! Some of us just got out of the gym! I've had enough of testosterone!
i remember this episode
0Dat eldritch adomination
remember the Clown/Mime episode?
0Silvermane, that's my favorite.
that one terrified me
I hate to admit it but
I used to watch this show all the time.
:0
0what silvermane said
this show was the bomb
herospirit, we all did
I accidentally the testosterone
i also watched Sailor Moon secretly
that is one classy cockroach
0Yeah, this was the shit. The FiM of that time
0well I didn't
0though I wish I had
lol
Dexter's Lab was awesome
7or two stupid dogs
good shows as well
0Yeah Sathi, but this was for girls.
Dexter's Lab was the shiznit.
Two Stupid Dogs and Angry Beavers
Was> Is.
0induring channeling soldier
really?
0Used to be, yeah.
:D
this was probably the most manly show on tv at the time
7eww
wow that's a long commercial
and they all died
7yep
the end
7:D
lol
0I guess it was time for thermonuclear war
heya guys
lol
beef and hog
EWWW
0ohgod
THEY'RE EATING HIM
NOT THE ROACHES
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME
/me 0watched this episode and Creepshow around the same time. He couldn't help relating the two
THEY'RE ON MY FACE
AAHHHHHHH

Hoping to get most of the lineart done tonight
Also thanks herospirit
/me brohoofs SilverMane
Well, it's definately coming along well! :D
but...
0looking good, for a Fluttershy picture...
It might be an ambitious project, but I'd like to do one for each of the mane 6
0Sterilization, Silvermane. That or cooties, I ain't gotta explain shit.
I know I'm not giving any helpful advice here, but I'm just in awe. :0
i see no pony
there the unicorn!
If I can get the background to actually fit in, it'll be good
awwwwwww
0What
7pt 1 & pt 2
That is a huge basket. :0
Thanks! It's been a hobby for many years
7xbmc*
0Does it cost much, Sathi?

7yes it is
yfw the cootie bugs show up in Season 2 :P
lol
0Oshit

-YOU DIED-
0what is that accent?

0I've been wondering for the past 7 years
i remember this theme
Angry Beavers?
OMG
0THIS
0Zombies
(thanks to Silvermane suggestion AB, because it's the same VA)
SATHI
The program?
oh I've missed this show
0ugh, I never liked this show
0Anyone remember how nick said they would be making more old cartoons?
This show was the BEST thing on Nickelodeon
14Angry Beavers!
/me shuns Elky
0Elky, go sit in the corner
/me 0cries a sigle tear
/me 7hugs Elky
oh Angry Beavers, ilu
lol catdog
0ohgod catdog
Norbert and Daggit
0iirc that was even worse
this show had the best never-made series finale ever. anyone heard the mp3 of the scene where they realize they're cancelled?
never seen it GGgala
Yes I have GG, it was great
never even heard of it
omg
I can't remember
Norbert's Va....
0implying dinosaurs didn't have the best finale
wait
>implying FiM doesn't have the best future finale
is Norbert voiced by Norm?
...how?
7how about some Eek the cat?
SilverMane: in that case requesting the Angry Beavers 'Network Slam.mp3' linked here after this show: http://www.micahwright.com/downloads.htm
0Rainbow leaves
thanks GGgala
0Dat post
/me is midly curious
mildly*
0hm
0another presentation
0boooooooring
7Elky?
7What do you want next?
7I was asking Elky
:(
7ok
7as long as it's no catdog right?
0eeeeyup
OMG
I actually rather missed this place
well, I rather missed this place when it was quite active and adorably random
but I missed this place nonetheless
bad touch
0Wasn't that bad. The clapping was the worst part
0And not even bad
Nawwww, i am not that memorable
Same CatDog situation as SilverMane here.
Eh
To be honest
Of course you are
yeah, CatDog was just... no.
I never really got into catdog <.< >.>
Weeeeeee!!!!!!!!
And thanks!
14I... actually kinda liked Catdog at first... :P
remember the catdog episode where they were going to get seperated via Pendulum axe?
I liked CatDog, it was weird but I still liked it.
it's a shame things like Xat exist, otherwise IRC would be quite popular
and I would like to imagine bandwidth usage would decrease
how does Norbert not hear or feel any of this
0I always thought this episode was weird. They completely swap attitudes afterwards
no kidding
pilot episodes and all
well we know how THOSE are :P
0Some offer plot continuity, while others change characters. Also, dat Rocko.
Rocko!
ROCKO
i never could get into Rocko
0Whaaaaaaaaaaat
0Rocko was crazy awesome
Rocko just... weirded me out
0Always some batshit crazy one off
Out of character?
7best night ever!
Elky: I doubt they'll be out of character
nothing can go wrong!
Pilot =/= first episode of later seasons in terms of changes and whatnot
in terms of plot yes
0That was hilarious. We need more cartoon physics.
0so there is some potential, since different plots require different characters
0well, we'll see
different plots don't require different characters
When I was a kid I wanted that phone.
you can have any kind of plot, and just have the characters react to it as they normally would
Actually, I still do.
0yes, but if they're initially developed for other plots, they'll react the same, which is boring
My wireless SUCKS!
0which is boring
which has no place in FiM
0yeah, I exaggerated a bit
7so guys
7last pick of the night
7counting votes
/me 7is currently stuck at 1
7going once
lol
umm

D'awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Edwardnewgate, dawww
>dat plot
wtf
I should sit on the stove for a minute to get my special talent?
inb4 cannibalism
SilverMane: Yes.
eww
?
Ahm Back.
I am kinda half heartedly doing Principles of Business homework
4Can't decide???
I feel I should be entertained, but...
POTS
0He wants some pot
For some reason, it frightened me.
Man, this show used to scare the shit outta me
I think it's something about the animation, for part o it.
I think this is the last stream for the night
7yes it is
7tomorrow more
4T___T
0yes, the animation feels kinda...
Wrong.
0no idea how to describe it
It feels wrong. :0
hey hey hey
I've seen plenty of Ren and Stimpy
:I
7Ren & Stimpy
damn.
That show was baws
7*notes down for tomorrow*
ung Ren & Stimpy
I saw enough of a cat eating it's own shit from the commercials for R&S.
4I just cannot believe people find Rocko's animation to be creepy and/or disturbing when Ren & Stimpy and Zim were far more disturbing
Sound is lagging.
4>weirder
he's not saying the content, just the way it's done is off-setting
4>Zim goes around stealing kids organs in one episode
4>but Rocko is weirder
Yes
Rocko has an episode where the whole world is taken over by sentient vacuum cleaners, though.
4Meh, whatever you say
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4YbO_1mvA&feature=player_embedded
I remember that one GGgala
4Ren & Stimpy are still far creepier in animation style
and that's how Equestria was made!
4No doubt about it
Ren and Stimpy was a little creepier, but this is really weird
The Vac-U-Suc 9000 or something.
4wut
4You guys...
4Something's wrong with you guys
I have a deeply engrained hatred for Ren and Stimpy.
IT IS
4Nope
0I think the right word is dirty
YES! THANK YOU, Elky.
0Dat sticky thing
You found the word.
0you never feel like anything in the show could be clean
My sound is lagging on stream.
to be fair
4Yeah, stream is lagging as well in sound
Rocko's was made during a time where everything had to be hand drawn
4It has a unique animation style
and making episodes as fast as it did was rather taxing
I do.
4I'm telling you, nothing's freakier than eventually turning into bologna
7try a refresh
0hm, maybe it's just that
4>funny
4>a slow
The miracle of cartoon garbage disposals
4>gradual
4>turn
hey, both Zim and Rocko are hilarious
4Yes, because slowly, gradually turning into meat is hilarious
4*er
4I CAN understand
>implying Rocko doesn't have similarly terrifying premises
4Tell me
Sound is lagging by 1 second
7not fixing it
4How is a vacuum running amok in the world terrifying?
Okay, you'll laugh at be for this, but....
at me*
4It just sucks up everything, there's no visceral transformation like meat disease
in retrospect, I also found Rugrats very unsettling
4But the vacuum can't eat
4It just sucks up
4They're still alive
Rugrats... dear lord, some of the shit i've read about that show
7goodnight everyone
4Night Sath
have a good night sathi
Cya.
night Sathi
14G'night Sathi!
7hope you enjoyed
thanks for streaming for us!
4I did
Night Sathi
4I enjoyed it
0night sathi, thanks for streaming
14I enjoyed the shows <3
The music in Rugrats was extremely unsettling
This was a nice trip through my childhood.
The show got crap past the radar like you wouldn't believe
I loved the Rugrats music
4So, naturally, it's creepy
4The one thing I remember that was naturally creepy
Rubrats, I mean
Rugrats*
And the animation was, again, unsettling. Maybe it's pastel colors that weird me out?
Lol.
4and he goes down the "no return" aisle
I remember that one.
14Hey now, I liked Rugrats growing up :P
0good night guys
it's probably just the older style of animation hero
14G'night Elky
night, Elky
again, hand drawn versus computer
night elky
gnight elky
4There's signs everywhere telling people "POINT OF NO RETURN," "NO EXIT."
4It's a long fall
4to a pit
4With a /skeleton/ at the bottom
4Yeah
4It's pretty terrifying
14"Mmmmm... I like pudding..."
The point of no return address.
The music in Rugrats makes me feel like all is completely wrong in the world. :0
all the streamers are nighty night now :(
it was fun
14:(
14Curse you DSL!
Wanna keep talking about Rugrats? :P
14If I had cable, I'd be streaming. But this connection cant hardly handle it.
/me 0wonders shy Val would want that
principles of business, half-hearted
I loved Rugrats
I liked it as a kid...but looking back on it....ung...
I remember liking it as a kid....
But looking back....
14I watched Rugrats growing up all the time.
Rugrats is silently terrifying.
14Then I watched All Grown Up. Yes, I watched that.
oh godf
NOT THE SPIN OFF SHOW
/me pukes
Do NOT look in Stue's basement.
14:D
14I did. lol
14Its slooooooooooooow :P
And you watched All Grown Up? O.o why?
0Speedtest?
Speedtest?
0hermind
XD
0*herdmind
Damn roomies!
/me doesn't have roomies
14As for All Grown Up, I dont know why I watched it. XD
:0
www.speedtest.net
14^
14Speakeasy is another popular one.
14I usually do both.
well, I think I might play some LoL for the rest of the night
14Just for a second opinion.
21/3 :(
it's been fun gents
have a good one
Shitty 'merica cable
bye Val
14Laters Val
No seriously. I hate you.
14And Ed, screw you. ;)
4What's wrong here?
14Haha
I only state the truth
14:D
15.68/1.94
Not saying it's bad
14It is now! >:|
But it's Cable
FFFFFFF
14lmao
9.74/1.05
ouch
:I
0What are these numbers?
14Better than my speeds
download/upload speeds
14Upload and download speeds
Dowload/upload speeds.
Which means when the neighbors decide to stream 1080p porn, I'm screwed
ninja'd you both
14FUUUUUUU
14Barry!
I'd do one, but my wired speeds =/= wireless speeds.
Barry also got the right order. :p
14Oh pfft :P
0I have 10.7/3.2 That good?
My wired/wireless speed is about the same.
14I have like 5-6/1
14Seriously
mfw the closest server is 45 mins away
Tests over Wireless shouldn't matter a thing unless you're far away from the router or have a shitty access point layout
2.67/.69
That's bullshit
I live in an apt complex and fight between other wireless router's outputs.
Oh goodness Newgate
My wireless is crippled by interference.
ADD A BADLY PLACED ACCESS POINT AND YOU'RE FUCKED THO
It's slow and tends to drop.
>.<
Haha, I have no idea how to do all this.
:I
250GB/month for me has proven plenty
But that isn't going to last
250GB/month would be nice.
I had a 60GB cap before switching providers.
I don't even worry about it. Five people in the home and there's no way it's even close to that
My speeds are dropping.
I have infinite bandwidth, too
The closest you are to the server the faster it is, usually
14Last place I lived my roomies opted for this really expensive but stupidly fast connection.
14We couldnt even handle near how fast it could run. lol
...
14Think it was the areas lines
14They couldnt handle the speeds
14So we downgraded
haha
14We all gamed online though and the slower one was fine :D
14Mmm fiber
We're using 10 megs now but can burst up to one gigabit/s
cool
nice
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwwvM4LKGg&feature=related
:0
Our current provider told us there could be no fiber in the building...
They signed a contract in January for extra bandwidth...
Futurama, such a good show
I'm STILL waiting for them.
Verizon gave me no cap, but I hated their customer service.
Is the music that's playing the actual song, or was it just an overlay?
And I only got 3/0.75 on DSL.
It was an overlay :P
I hate verizon with all my passion
Yeah, I realized that when I checked the full title
Instead, they did line tests, then just told me it was my problem.
damn them
The last 3 reps I talked to before cancelling my server were rude, too.
Now they don't really employ reps anymore I don't think. They're 90% automated.
And I hate automated answering services.
Yep
We have service with them at work
They drive us to drink.
was that to me or Nittany, AiZ?
Nittany, Barry
Though he lives in SC, which is fairly thick in coverage.
Yeah it makes no sense to have that kind of crap with today's tech
I got a 4G phone from them, kept it for two weeks cause the signal was just shit
Well
Like you can get awesome speeds in Hong Kong or Japan for dollars cheaper than here.
No, not quite crappy but
In terms of broadband adoption we're still way behind
Like the plains.
Where population densities are too low to make it affordable to companies.
Corporations won't build to those places if it's just to look good on a PR note
I know that.
America is just a bunch of stingy bastards right now
COULDN'T CARE LESS<
SEE I LEARNED
lol
I bet they could care less
if they worked hard at it
See the one thing I'm not really understanding right now is
Why people aren't out on the streets mobbing up government facilities
I can't enjoy one of my former favorite hobbies because of poor customer treatment.
I just came back from the grocery store and saw that a liter of mineral oil is like 5 bucks
It's $3.59 here.
Err, oil
I'm partially socialist. I think some industries may need regulation.
Starting with the one I pay great attention to: the gaming industry.
About the gaming industry?
They've been pretty crafty recently. Things like purposefully removing content to sell as DLC.
Yep
But I think DRM should be the first thing to be regulated.
The government is in the hands of the RIAA.
Yeah, for the benefit of the corporations.
Like S971
Corps are more concerned about piracy than content.
Are they? ;-;
They are, herospirit, but that's because right now they can get away with it.
;_;
Ever again.
They aren't that stupid, they just think you are too lazy to do anything about it.
^
And some other titles.
Got ya. I'm not good with company names.
Might and Magic series.
Yeah.
They're making D3 always-on.
And then they get surprised when everyone hates them for it.
No, it's always-on.
Which is very stupid.
Unless they encrypt those packets, then it might take a few weeks.
Saying it was one-time activation, but it was a log-in system or always-on.
Maybe I'm just weird, but the games I really want, I go out and actually buy'em one way or another.
I buy them to obey the law, but having to deal with DRM like Ubisoft just makes me want to quit that.
Exactly. :0
And they're not going to force me.
Ubisoft doesn't.
When it decides to work.
^
Most of the time it just decides to not work
brb
Oh really?
The old version did.
Wait, why did I log out to change my name, there is not +N
Gay
Yeah. That was really dumb
But I don't care.
Anyone wanna talk about something less depressing? No? Alright, I'll be over here. :I

Deus Ex 1 and 2
See you all tomorrow, good night.
Later.
Haven't beat GTA: San Andreas nor GTA4.
I just have a ton of games to run through.
Or like CoD, give good players killstreaks to throw matches out of balance.

Herospirit, needs more DOHOHOHOHO
He needs more spiky hair.
AND A PET FISH ON HIS SHOULDER!
...Back. I was practicing my DOHOHOHOHO, but I was thinking more of a GGRAAHAHAHAHA.
Also, bigger swords are hard to come by locally, but I'm trying. And last time I tried the fish thing, it died. :I
I can get a genuine Sephiroth replica sword at the mall for like 150
and some assorted bastard swords, longswords, katanas, etc.
Darn you and living somewhere cool and not in the middle of no where.
herospirit, i live in flint. #1 or #2 in the country for homicide. and it's empty

efreet: those sound spooky and nutrious!
they are
Not really.
Explain how it's an intristically evil system.
Particularly when applied practically.
how about
we discuss pinkie pie
Political debate arriving in 3... 2... 1...
Pinkie Pie is a capitalist, she works at a store.
Nickel_Scream its not irrational.
I disagree.. Pinkie Pie doesnt work in a store
She helps out in a store
Work requires payment
Actually was that actually addressed in the show? Whether Pinkie was paid monies?
She receives room and board.
I dunno tbh
thought it was more of an apprentice system
Also, whatever happened to Pinkie's Amish family?
It's still the best one that works.
probably still out there, moving the rocks around
AJ/Rarity have their jobs.
Rainbow Dash probably is payed by Cloudsdale as a weathermare
and pets..
rarity and applejack have been shown onscreen to be working way too hard for it to be a hobby
Hey, Shark!
Rarity always has orders to fill.
Radimir: capitalism and democracy aren't synonymous.
Sharksky.
Nickel_Scream: no, but the point stands: capitalism is probably the worst economic system we have, except the others
Chloroform.
Nickel_Scream why are you vehemently defending HT?
although it's possibly more debateable
I hope Celestia doesn't charge much...
I was just using a similar situation to explain my point.
Whoa, wait, you're attacking his motives?
She probably had to take out a loan.
<blink/>
Rarity probably is the group spender come to think of it.
she's just baiting.
Either that or shes very stupid.
I'll assume the former since its less direspectful.
I am inclined to believe that ignorance is the issue here.
sure it was facetious, though the kernel of it is the belief that any form of regulation is evil socialism
Judging from the spelling and grammar used.
43
Yes. Sharksky
Chloroform.
Ooh, we had a massive philosophical discussion in EAD, Shark.
I don't want any.
A few hours ago.
AWWWWW
?
Regulation is awesome.
Political philosophy
Results: None, none, probably.
Aliens are real.
Pinkie Pie has contacted them.
To be fair, that topic came in later.
Radimir.
Mmm, I should go sleep. but ponies.
Let us discuss something important.
Ja?
Pinkie Pie and Coffee.
Nickel_Scream hate is far to strong a word bro(ny)
Is it physically possible?
Efreet like? OMFG PONIES ON SEPT 17TH!
Pinkie and caffeine? Let us not think about it.
Nickel_Scream okay.
Just like the Mythbusters crossed with MLP:FiM
Nickel_Scream fine ill put it in plain english
Pinkie Pie + Coffee.
Pinkie Pie explodes.
I think that's the proper conclusion Sharksky.
!link http://img.ponibooru.org/images/76/76a2205a5fd05c7c98f058dd89b2ac3d
Stop saying that.
That's the Mythbusters comic.
Efreet ditto!
The one and the same!
Needs more luna.
*Luna
Needs moar Kind and Caring Celestia
Rainbow Dash has become disloyal
etc.
Pinkie Pie makes alot of ponies cry accidently
Does that mean that Twilight has become a pegasus/earth pony?
but
she's like
Fair enough. Need the one sane man.
They just represented them.
They acted as living conduits for the pre-existing powers.
Yeah, Pretty much.
Never thought of that.

then I saw a really sad pic that suggested her bluster was because of a sad backstory.
then I just felt kinda bad for her.
Yup
FallSilently Id laugh if theres actually a statistical bearing for people booking time off work. :P
do you think the ponies are
Well
Somebody did that apple comparison chart.
Fragging internets.
If it was on a weekday the nation's lecture halls would be empty.
And I think it was like, 1.2m.
AAAGH!
They're ponies.
I'm 1.86 metres
I SHALL FIND PINKIE PIE
HOP ON HER BACK
AND RIDE INTO SCHOOL.
.. well
Bounce into school.
Knowing pinkie pie.
More like just sort of appear at school.
that too.
1.88976 meters.
At 9am, a simultaneous harmony breaks out from every laptop:
My Little Pony, My Little Pony...~
LOL
heh
Including the lecturer's
that would be amazing.
Suddenly classes would break out into everyone singing the theme song together.
Actually, it'd be awesome if someone organised that.

Sudden improv singing? I approve.

Nickel_Scream.
I hate you.
Now I'm thinking about that
its pretty terrifying if you think about it.
Prove that it doesn't happen.
Each day had a different man.
I'm just todays.
Well, there would have been, initially.
but he would've been a baby and been able to have no real expeiences.
his clones are more real them him.
Think back five minutes ago. Are those memories real? Or programmed?
we'll need to go deeper into the dream.
Did I just type that? Or have I just been switched on with that preprogrammed?
Ponies dream of Humans.
You can't get out.
This is making my head hurt.
best book ever.
I loved its movie adaptaion, Glade runner.
I shall awake from this dream..
Its worth considering that if you ever get ghost-binding powers.
and become a full pony!
Ooh, maybe if that's the case, I'll wake up because I realized it.
Or not...
How many of you here are actual Matrix victims, and how many of you are freed humans hacking in from outside trying to wake me gently?
Maybe we'll all go to sleep sometime..
and wake up
/me raises hand
You're the last Matrix victim, FallSilently.
I'm trying to wake you gently.
I'm sorry.
We can't wake you.
Wake up.
You must die.
You, wake up.
You're asleep. Wake up.
Sorry.
100% confirmed
Okay, I'll accept that some of you must be Agents too.

/me hugs Shaico like there's no tommorrow
'Nutswallow' makes him sound like a bitch.
Can't...breathe...
well it would be a chick with an afro.
Liek the biggest one ever.
She's just a hoe, then.
/me lets go of Shaico "Sorry"
No, she shoot things.
My poor name.
While being a hoe.
She's the queen of the hoes.

She doesn't actually hoe. She's like a lady pimp.
Revenge. :3

Oh, agh!
I won't.
I am some pumpkins
Thank you Shaico.

You're welcome. :)

Trying to find something to watch on Netflix
Kitchen Nightmares.
Gordon Ramsay is positively dreamy.
and ponies here from Flankbook as well?
Should I start with Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams?
I'm not on Flankbook
Flankbook is a tad derpish
It is rather exclusive.
Everyone uses that.
Yeah and?
I need a reason?
actually yeah.
I never use Flankbook.
Okay...
To communicate with others?
Mmhmm.
I use IMs for that
I use Smoke signals.
Does there need to be?
yet
Radimir: of course not
I was doing ranged communications before they were cool

Yodeling, you say?
And losing family.

Anyone else agree with me on Pinkie Communication?
Yup
Untamed: That may be the best thing humanity has created thus far.
Sums up Pinkie pretty well
You are forgetting her telepathic powers, however.
ok guys i g2g. cya
Oh right. Her telepathic powers.. I forgot all about them.
See yah!
She only uses them LONG distances.
*hugs everyone*
i can help with that
She's the "half-rose one"
Pinkie Pie communication protocol makes HTML5 look basic
:D
And if she has an urgent message? She just dons her Karate outfit and breaks down the 4th wall.
Give it time
Thanks, FallSilently, I found it and thought I should share n.n
"My Pinkie Senses are tingling. Something's going to fall."
I had a dream that pinkie chewed me out for smoking.
That could have multiple meanings o.O
He'd probably get it from Acme though, which means it would be fail
i see
untamed: multiple meanings?
He looks for jobs and waits for university to start again.
Pinkie Pie communications are copyrighted by Pinkie Pie. The only place you can get those sorts of communications are from Pinkie Pie Inc.
I sense the word "chew" is about to be keyed on.
/me nods
for smoking?!

I don't think there's any possible way you can hate a Pony.

Seriously.

You can dislike them. But never hate.

You know you've set a trend when at 3 AM this happens...
21.8.2011 2:30am - 3:00am was a busy time for #EquestriaDaily - 64 ponies active
Active users during this 30-minute period were (in order of appearance):
I was just trying to guess where DeadBarney is.
Good job, you just pinged 64 ponies.
FallSilently: france
Wow, Lunasta. You did not just do that xP
Yes, yes I did.
Doesn't matter to me.
/me hugs Lunasta <3
But you were close
What's pinging?
/me hugs Shaico
/me yawns

hmm

Strange.....
!hug

And it did
Why not call it dinging instead of pinging?
Ding bing bong
It's more like a bloop
It's useful for annoying people like Locke and Shaico.
Are you calling me annoying, or are you using annoying as a verb?
Muhahahahaaa
This song reminds me of fPhantasy Star Online/Universe
I'm using it to annoy people like Locke and Shaico.

Hey, no annoying my Shai

I saw Inception. Wasn't too hard to follow.
Inception is elementary compared to Donnie Darko.
Hit up Knowyourmeme quick-like!
Donnie was a headwreck.
I'm surprised Donnie Darko hasn't become a meme yet.
*shrugs at Donnie Darko*
Too old.
That movie was masterfully done.
2001.
rar
Probably also why there are no X-Files memes. Not. One.
Oh my. I just had an epiphany.
..
Take this!
Go! Go! Gooooooooo!

I really am a level 10 wixard!

You mean 2 mil per day? x3
it's become such a phenomenon it's crazy
2 million per second.
2 million wut?
10 million in 10 seconds flat
over 9000?
Pony is that good.
Combo reference joke!
Well at least it's helped a lot of people find friends.
especially having been stopped for more than three months. that'd normally kill something going like this
O_O
friends are fine too
and homestuck for about a year
Yep
Poooooniiesss..
poniesponiesponiesponiesponiesponies
Heh, here's hoping the same for me I guess
Shaico - Then the challenge lies in converting them.
brb
I already converted a few.
Few being two.
The quest isn't over until it's ALL of them.
I've converted none.
For I have no friends.
:(
I've half-converted one. I'm trying my darndest on the rest.
And I mean obsessed.
And he saw Top Gear's post on their website.
I am a bit, still.
WHY?
Fireant.
Well that's one person, Firant.
*Fireant
/me steps on Fireant
efreet i want to kill you
Yes, but I haven't noticed a single person try to even drop hints of ponies, while I hum/whistle a lot of the songs crossing campus.
But Lunasta...
:P
Nein Fireant!
Look!
ITs the moon!
INB4 kick
Seconds Balloons
LOL
:P
:<
Lunasta, are youe even a girl? xD
It's more of my current situation, but let's just leave it at I honestly don't know how people would react
/me facehoofs
Sure Efreet.
Or else... :p
bye Luna
Maybe if I see something different when I get back ;O
I have
Movie, I mean.
as well
Anyhoo, getting ready for school
as mentioned, Pokemon's been a part of my like for over a decade and people generally associate me of one of three things
No Shaico.
Good night everyone
Okay then.
xD
goodnight untaimed
It is.
iluvuShaico ;D
Ponies shouldn't call it weird. It is harmless enjoyment watching a show that teaches good morals. There are a lot weirder things out there in the world.
/me hugs Shaico
Yet now I am a pony.
/me hugs Lunasta.
My school does not have the stereotypical popular kids rule.
!moon Untamed's cat
as in, pretty much everyone plays it for some reason. Mainly because it's one of the few things that runs on the computers well
Grab my tail, Untamed's cat!
I want to hug a pony >_> I dunno If I should be sharing this info amunst people or not.... but... whichever
xD
i'm a farmer. my friends are farmers; they don't care asside from finding it mildly amusing, :P
To be popular = be nice and don't be excessively weird.
wierd is the shit
Shaico: I can't be popular in that case
I am very popular.
As I said, it's more of acceptable because it's one of the few things that people can play on the computers
In my part, I am like The Fonz.
I always do that.
!link
no
http://fav.me/d43gp1r
Weirdness should totally be shown to all.
Shaico: I hate doing that... makes me feel boring
'Tis more amusing on the part of the person being weird.
Learning_with_Lunasta: to be a part of the crowd that is not a part of the crowd
If being weird makes you feel special...
:\
I'm an individual,within a group of individuals.
Individualception
so...you're unique...just like everyone else...
No, I'm just generally weird as a person. People accept it, move on.
DUN DUN DUN
One could say you're weird but that's just because everyone is different. They live different lives, and grew up differently.
Everypony.
Let us discuss an important topic.
No matter how strange I've acted beforehand, people have accepted me
why should it be different with this?
yet somehow it is
:(
they'll only react badly if you obsess over it.
^
Efreet - Make it Trixie and we have deal.
Fine.
Let us discuss..
She is a scam!
A scam I tells you.
trixie is overrated
She sucks. :P
She's like Luna.
Take ALL of that back! All of you!
nope.avi
no!
I'll be interested if she re-appears in season 2
*grumble*
Trixie is a balloon. She's full of hot gas.
I think being different shouldn't really be noticed by yourself.
.avi
All this blasphemy. Trixie is awesome!
>INB4 hated for basing opinions just on canon information
Don't drag luna into this...
If you start to try to be different, then you should really stop.
she seems one-off, but if Derpy's a character now then Trixie might be too.
well I think it's important to have restraint
not to many though
At least Trixie had substance.
I hope alot of the Background ponies get some episodes..
