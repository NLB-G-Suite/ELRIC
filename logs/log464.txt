The boss looks like a penis from the side view
Egad
hmmmmmm, glowing spot seems legit
And yet I have played games on the 360 with worse mechanics
Poached egg is best egg.
This boss makes an appearance in 64, actually
Do a Barrle roll

Üpöydunami: Is he the alternative boss of the first world?
Meanwhile..................yeah i still dont get it...box isnt working..

Hi everypony

and finds out there was One Before Celestia
Yep

I think it was called "Out of this Dimension"
Not replaying
xD
03the Spice Girls movie?
07ah
07right
Whoa, that's a complex idea
specifically Conan the musical
ships bein attacked by metroids
to go after the one pony to secure victory
Celestia
SPAAAAAAAACE
03they have that friend who's pregnant
make her go crazy
crazy enough to frighten the Ponies
BOOM
03is this a fourth-wall thing?
into a revolt
03they're discussing the movie during the movie?
it's only a matter of time
and heres a little fact I glossed over
they had soooo many versions. NZ only got the first one thanks to some idiot doing a kick into a pane of glass and ruining it for the rest of us...
PLUS.
Hello everypony :D

Stop feeding
I tihnk he is gone
He is gone
03but yeah, for the regular song I like the radio edit... in fact I actually obtained something quite rare, had to import it from Germany
^
03the "no indo" radio version
DOH!
I really should read my typing before I hit enter
I always died on multiplayer :/
twice actually
for the wii, and for ps3/xbox
I rarely die thanks to Odd Job :) <---- (GET HIM!!)
dat pause music
wish i had tough
Oddjob's most memorable line: "Ah ah!"
^
yes
He wasn't tiny in Goldfinger
But he was mute
ITs always the quiet ones
Ive "played" FFXIII before
Dat aim
Boom Headshot
I've seen FF13 played before
02didn't know there was a radio version
That was me, I picked him
"played"
03yeah
wow, guns open doors
I could watch it right now...
Same here
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QUu1MPzsOs
xD
Can guns bake cakes?
Guns dont kill people, bullets do
03it's completely re-recorded with different lyrics, not just censored :P
I feel sorry for people who've only played FFXIII/FFXIII-2 and none of the preceding games
I feel sorry for anyone who's played the FF franchise :P
02yeah
I've played all except for VIII and XI
I've never played FF
VII ftw
he's probably going to shoot rabbits or jbe on the computer
Well the only FF games I ever played were 1- 6 am I in the clear?
*just be
03but you'll see the chorus still has "smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice"
I like FF# (the nes one)
03the one I have removes that
I'm sure it's a matter of taste but I don't really do turn based combat.
FF3*
03it's played on the radio a lot, but I had to actually record it off the radio xD
ff7:cc was great
hello everypony
Turn based is something meant for chess.
I only play strategy rpgs nowadays
Oops
but chess is awesome!
Umm
Did it die?
11,02Bored
Oh
ok
Apparently there is an FF14
*retry
Yeah, FF14 was released too soon, apparently
Too soon Executus.
14*
You would think they would announce FF15 by now
i never liked the direction FF took after 7, i mean yeah the drama was quite high in 6 but it was well balanced
Can they not just let FF die?
Probably at the next E3
Maybe up to FF CCDXXIV?
WII
seems legit
I would rather they just make Kingdom Hearts 3...
ooh Gamecube
I hope they'll make a FFVII remake before they quit the franchise, even though they said they won't :p
wait no
Ive never played KH
Wii
I didnt like the fact that donald and goofy were in it
thats a gamecube
