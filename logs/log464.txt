11,01If lighting strikes your house, you'll be fine as long as you're not touching anything metal.
CCCP: I am part of you:O i am your SOOOUUULLLLL:O
11,01Or wired to the house.
:O
11,01Lightning travels through metal.
But what about the FIRE
icybeauti: (\ EST CRUSADERS!
/me hugs CCCP
Nittany_Discord: What about the Farraday effect? :S
iammrcrap: but seriously do i know you?
11,01Fire danger as well.
Fire, Fire, FIRe, I AM on FIRE!!!!
/me nuzzles alexxm :3
In costa rica, they have the most incidents of people gettign struck. pikorar East coast FTW
CCCP I thought you sold your soul to bronystate
/me is awesome
i think maybe....
11,01Induction?
Nittany_Discord: houses actually are normally required to have a ground, so you'd be fine regardless i believe, provided your house is grounded
GilDash: thats only if youre surrounded by aconductor
RaveBrony: the correct response is "My hair is on fire! My hair is fire!"
I got my soul taken from FlareChaser apparently >.>
/me chants fire like beavis.
11,01You mean Faraday cage?
i don't have a soul
Invi: i sould my soul to moot
Dashite: Lol!! :D

/me is NOT a ginger, lol
hey cachi01 hows your day been
nice alexxm thx
I'm a daywalker since I have auburn hair lol.
Nittany_Discord: I don't know. But if it were wouldn't that mean the stuff inside doesn't matter? :S
Nittany_Discord: but the house isnt all metal, doesnt the cage have to be a conductor?
iammrcrap: mabey i wrong your name just seems fumilliar
G'day cachi01 :P
ingwaz: creator of 4chan
hi RaveBrony!
:$
hi cachi01
CCCP he has been here before
hi CCCP!
CCCP: well... do you play TF2?
Good evening, Bronystate. I trust it was a pleasant weekend?
Hey Guys! im back! :D
alexxm: are you sure?
:O
/me curses his lack of physics knowledge.
Hey Reikim :P
iammrcrap: not really

Hi Reikim
Reikim: Hiya. The weekend is one more day this week.
hey Reikim hows your day been
CCCP: oh nevermind
moin cachi01
/me just laughs at Gillysuit
hi Invi!
alexxm: Fantastic, bordering on magnificent. For once, I actually got some work done.
GilDash: All you really need to know is that pinkie nor chuck norris apply to the rules of physics.
wut are u talking about the creator of 4chan???????''
Guess what I'm doing as we all speak?
...awww
what work fo you do Reikim
icybeauti and the people of star wars
Who did create the god forsaken place. Invi....Right them too.
icybeauti: Neither do I apparently. I've done some physically impossible stuff before. In front of Doctors in physics. :D
iammrcrap: typing
what iammrcrap
alexxm: Things and stuff. Mostly trying to teach myself programming, a bit of writing, etc., etc.
i am reading homesuck
iammrcrap: clopping?
I like rain if there isn't thunder.
GilDash you created a time paradox?
*homestuck
Invi: I froze ice-water with salt. :D
CCCP: Same :3
hows it coming along Reikim
RaveBrony: O_O
lightning is best fireworks
im in the begginning of act 3
didnt see the other thing u said
alexxm: Poorly. Lack of motivation and proper programming excercise means I never actually practice anything...
My dog goes commando when she hears thunder. Even me, who's scared, lols at it.
guys, i had SO much fun at the air show yesterday
RaveBrony: someone is getting famous :P now you know whow I feel with 500 people talking to me at once...
GilDash why is that physically impossible? We did that too
it such a good anime
I like Rain from MK :D
i love the thunder as it lights up the sky RaveBrony
Yaya ^
lightning*
Anyone else here plays sports besides me?
FlareChaser: What?? O.o
Reikim why not find someone to help teach it to you
Who?
CCCP: "creator of 4chan" what was that about?
I took pictures. http://pinkies4thwall.tumblr.com/
icybeauti: I play paintball and football
alexxm: Because all my best learning is done myself.
ingwaz: oh i was talking about moot
iammrcrap: if u are reading it how cn it be anime?????
waiting to see Men In B
Black 3
Niko! My Cousin!!!
droid
its called manga
Invi: When you add salt to water it increases it's salinity, thus increasing the freezing point (or ice melts faster). I managed to *freeze* the water there. :D
starts in ~20 mins
Pinkies4thWall|busy: Dat cat! /)^3^(\
CCCP: uhh...okay? i didnt bring up 4chan at all though
cachi01: just sattire

Invi: Please, speak plain. :D
11,01Lightning is starting to calm down in frequency.

GilDash: That was plain.
Nittany_Discord: I love lighting. :)
CCCP: so, would you say i was awesomely heroic then?
/me tickles CCCP whos a silly filly
cachi01: okay
alexxm: BEST EVENT EVER
ingwaz: yes
11,01I do too.
GilDash salt crystal gets broke => it gets colder => water freezes near the salt water
/me loves Nittany_Discord
good to hear you liked it Pinkies4thWall

CCCP: awesome
Om: Not when you're tipsy it isn't. :D

/me nomz alexxm
Me hearing lightning: :) ... Me when lightning fries my comp: :[
:D!!!
GilDash: Oh supper. You're getting drunk.
Nittany_Discord: just prolong the exposure
Invi: Yeah, but the *entire* thing shouldn't freeze, right? :S
Om: Getting? Already there. :D
11,01Yeah.
i have to go now!
So....now what?
bye everypony
GilDash: Oh, it just gets better.
CCCP: Nooo, why? D:
11,01I have a special camera that has variable exposure times.
Bye CCCP
GilDash if you put enough salt in it, it is possible ^^
Cya CCCP! :(

Bye CCCP ! :)
RaveBrony: MFW you HEAR lightning... :S
Me hearing lighting: :S Me hearing lightning while reading ccreepypasta: (insert face of someone scared till death)
RaveBrony: i have to go to a party

Om: Better is good. 'Sides, I'm a good drunk. :)

Okay, I need to cause a shitstorm...
CCCP: Dont forget your party cannon!!! D:
CCCP show them the pinkie party style ^^

Invi: Oh, okay. We must've just had really crap supervisors then. :D
GilDash: Okie dokie lokie then <_<
hey Merc_Xephos hows your day been
Pinkies4thWall: U no like lightning??
RaveBrony: I don't like it either.
GilDash and it depends on the salt you use ^^
bye guys i will be back in 30 minutes
If you get a ping from a mod, you get closer to Equestria, isnt that right Nittany_Discord ?
RaveBrony: How the buck do you HEAR lightning
?
Bye cachi01
bye cachi01
Pinkies4thWall: Oh, roflmao!!! :D
6_9 derp
Pinkies4thWall thunder?
Invi: Rock salt? I think... :D
Yes, i like SEING lightning, and Hearing thunder! Ty, Pinkies4thWall :$
GilDash thats to dispell ghosts
Invi: no. thunder is the air coming back together after lightning
Hate rain strom teams that uses thunder
alexxm: If you say so... :S
GilDash rock = salt as far as i know ^^
Invi: Fine! Sodium Chloride. :p
....
GilDash have you heard of a show called supernatural
chat r ded
11,01FlareChaser: Uhhhhh
alexxm: Yeah, but I know nothing of it.
Nittany_Discord: OH! that was my last ping, I get to go to Equestria now!
Nittany_Discord: ahhh now i finally get why RD is your fav
GilDash oh that stuff ^^ we call it Kochsalz here ^^ (cooking salt)
So many PM's being had in chat
well in that show they use bullets used out of rock salt to fight ghosts GilDash
Pinkies4thWall: dem PM's
Invi: Oh, okay. :D
THAR
:D
Time to have some fun with Octavia, if you know what I mean...
Orchestra! :D
alexxm: You know you can use cartridges filled with rock salt in shotguns as a non-lethal alternative.
11,01twilight_sprinkler: Because she's a weather pony?
GilDash I'm too lazy to calculate that stuff xD
yeah GilDash
Nittany_Discord: yeah, lightning, tornadoes, etc.
Invi: Don't worry. I wouldn't know where to start. :D
^^
/me looks at the internet
Numbers!
took me long enough
alexxm: I don't even know how I found that out. :D
11,01I like RD's personality and her involvement with weather.
Om: Where? Where are they?!
Im starting to get the hang of Minecraft
GilDash: In your head, making more numbers
hi again
Nittany_Discord: equally?
i ust guessed something simular could happen in real life GilDash
Cypresswolf: never played Minecraft before?
I dislike Rainbow Dash.
gonna do TF2 tutorials for all classes
Hi Woodenfan
hey Woodenfan hows your day been
shes the least favorite of the mane6 for me.
no, just started yesterday
Om: More numbers? Well, if you insist. ;)
Cypresswolf: PC or Xbox?
PC
oh
GilDash: Damit not what I meant.
/me hugs Woodenfan
And FlareChaser, I know how you feel, I think she's too brash and too eager to start fights. Too simple-minded and greedy as well.
sorry
Woodenfan: Yeah, I knew she was going to react badly, but when she burst out crying it actually hit me pretty hard.
anyways to TF2
when can we watch something?
11,01twilight_sprinkler: Dunno.
Om: When will you learn? :D
Woodenfan: exactly
I don't know why everyone gets up in arms about Mare do well.
heh kk
So...is there a stream, or am I just terminally prone to lag?
GilDash: Probably... a very long time from noww
hey everypomy! I'm back!
GilDash i guess he appreciates it ^^
Pony*
moin Biglaw ^^
0,14Stream is on pause for now, I believe
Reikim: well i'm not getting anything either
hey Biglaw hows your day been
Hi Biglaw!
Om: I've got all the time in the world to wait for you. ;)
11,01Mare-do-well was OK. Worst episode of S2. Not bad by itself, though.
alexxm fine
11,01It just had nothing special.
hi BigLaw
I made some iron armor, explored a cave on peaceful mode - died once from skeletal archer
Nittany_Discord: Best episode of S2?
GilDash: e_e I thought you were a nice drunk
Nittany_Discord: And I think they butchered RD's personality to an extent for the plot. :S
Om: I am. :)
Reikim: A Canterlot Wedding parts 1 & 2
Nittany_Discord: i thought it was pretty funny, and it did have an important lesson for RD, celestia knows she needed some character development in that department
11,01Yeah. RD became arrogant in Mare Do Well.
GilDash: I dissent.
I have saved this lawn!
Nittany_Discord: She always was, they just decided to play it up for the episode.
Nittany_Discord: Not to mention a severe case of the idiot ball. Seriously, they never even tried to talk to her? =_(\
Gabe<oist hurray!!
My least favorite MLP episode is The Show Stoppers.
Cypresswolf: Once you find diamond for the first time it will be the greatest thing ever
I dont know why, I just...it was...meh.
GilDash: they did as i recall
Nittany_Discord: lol, she always was, just like rarity can come off as greedy some times, i meant the resolution of the matter
Om: I'll have to ignore you, because I don't know what that word means and I don't care to look it up. :)
11,01And Applejack a liar?
I like Twilight Sparkle out of the whole mane6
the most
FlareChaser /)
Flare Chaser: I like fluttershy
GilDash: It means he disagrees é).=
twilight_sprinkler: They never actually pulled her off to the side and told her she's acting out of turn. Every time they expressed their dissaproval it was never so RD could here it.
GilDash: It means dissagree. And its easyer to spell
Cypresswolf, are you a miner?
Om: Irrelevant. :)
well... a show where someponey does NOT have to work through thier character flaws?!?
what?
GabeMoist: no
my Brony friend HATES Rarity, what do I do?
GilDash: rd isnt really the type to sit and listen though is she?
GilDash: You drunk what would you know.
Cypresswolf: No, just start digging deep down underground.
GilDash: she probably wouldve ignored them anyway
I luuvv rarity.
Om: Ironic, that some of the less-common words are easier on the fingers.
were you talking about minecraft Cypresswolf
ingwaz: And that would've been fine because they would have tried before they schemed. But they didn't, which makes it idiot ball.
I firmly believe that there is no "Best pony"
11,01Fluttershy only broke kindness in S2 with Putting Your Hoof Down.
twilight_sprinkler: See my comment to ingwaz.
11,01We're going to exclude discorded Fluttershy.
each one has thier own strengths and weeknesses
Reikim: Yeah, english is weird.
Cypresswolf: Yeah
What about dragonshy?
what about the cockatrice?
GilDash: Or maybe "the writers only have less than half an hour to work through a complex plot wherein one of Dash's fatal character flaws is exploited".
Om: You'd be surprised just how well I can handle myself whilst drunk. :)
Nittany_Discord: she also went a bit berserk when they tried to get er to the dragon migration, plus the gala ep, plus the stare
11,01She got assertive, but not mean.
Reikim: It just seemed too OOC even for Dash.
11,01I guess.
Reikim: I guess that's just me.
11,01She did go nuts at the Gala.
Nittany_Discord, she got mad
want to know how bad I am at math?
she didn't get Glad
GilDash: I really don't want to eke you on any more then. e_e
assertiveness and mean is a fine line sometimes Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Didn't she have a go at Pinkie Pie and Rarity though, practically driving Rarity to tears? :S
Okay this is how bad I am bad at math: My last math grade was 34.
GilDash: Not really. There are a lot who agree with you. Most of us just let it be and remain thankful that we even have the show.
:|
0,14She should've gotten Glad, GabeMoist, I hear it's a good brand
thats low
but.. at teh end of putting your hoof down, she showed that you can be... assertive.. and nice
11,01I said Putting Your Hoof Down was when Fluttershy broke her kindness.
alestorm is a good band i recomend it
Also found I can run Minecraft better from external hard drive - less laggy - might have to move all my games to external hard drive now
Reikim: Hey, I'm not one to harp on about it. It's just what I thought, would've been fine otherwise.
11,01But someone brought up Best Night Ever.
*i did*
Alestorm, oh yes, I had that streamed here once
Cypresswolf: Just remember that your imagination is your limit
fluttershy is eeeeveeeel
what song GabeMoist
Nittany_Discord: every member of the mane 6 has at least one serious character flaw that has to do with their element. they'd be rather poor characters if they were complete saints
Nittany_Discord: Still trying to figure out why that happened, without resorting to Rule of Drama or Rule of Funny
11,01Alright. Storm's mostly passed.
You are a Pirate
Nittany_Discord: is that good or bad for you?
ya gobshite
11,01Good.
Nittany_Discord: awww, i like storms
yah i like storms too
11,01I can stream again.
11,01I like storms.
i hate bright sun
Reikim: Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome. Or, CMFIS.
11,01I just don't need one right now.
In my opinion the worst episodes are the ones that don't stand out.
11,01I hate droughts.
11,01Because they are boring.
alexxm, we need a MLP x Cider Drinker PMV
GilDash: I've heard of that. I think everyone's gotten it so far except maybe AJ and RD.
how about wenches and mead PMV GabeMoist
Om: Yeah. There's several episodes that are blank in my head until I re-watch them. Those that remain must obviously be my favourite. :D
Cypresswolf: Build your favorite pony
Cider Drinker would be better because there is a cider MLP episode
i didn't get mah cheevo for doing a campaing with only meelee ._. haaax
I think I can officially say Nittany_Discord x ... x.... who is nittany shipped with again?
good point GabeMoist
GilDash: Or ones you hate. Can't forget that end of the spectrum.
GilDash: Yupers. And there arent to manny I cant recall
I plan to start making designs via animal crossing and using those pixels to determine how big I want structures to be
hey huguy
11,01Shipped with no-one officially. Will only accept Nittany_Discord x Shizuka.
Reikim: AJ had hers druing applebucking season, where she tried to live up to saying she'd clear the fields and failed. Dash's was more minor, where she basically freaks out during Sonic Rainboom.
...are all the mods online?
Nittany_Discord, so you're forever alone
GilDash: That's not loyalty, though.
3D sculptures seem too advanced for me at the moment :)
11,01GabeMoist: I know.
Reikim: That's not her cutie mark. ;)
Cypresswolf: lol
GilDash: ...Damn, sorry, got things mixed up :P
I didn't like the MMMystery episode very much, too much hooves acting like hands and a part where the animators got lazy
11,01All of the girls I like are not interested in me (or are afraid to express interest).
Thank you, prince-lemon. Why is he a lemon, anyway?
/me is keepign a watchful eye over bronystate.
My brother Mike is studying to become an engineer, he could help me out in that, if I can get him into the game
Reikim: No shakes. :)
Because lemons are your God here.
0,14Wrek is like a hawk
Surrender to the lemons.
All the girls I like are.... I dont like any girls or guys or other...I HATE EVERYONE :|
11,01GabeMoist: No.
...I've been away too long. When did lemons ascend to divine status?
FlareChaser: :(
I know a Brony girls. She is in to me. Its great. :D
are there any enemies in peaceful mode? I just want to explore the place today :)
lemons have always been at divine status
teh|Spitfire: lolnvm :3
FlareChaser why? I mean i hate people too, but why do you hate them?
0,14nope, Cypresswolf
GilDash: brb in a bit alright? ^^
but not for long
panda: Oh, okay. :D
0,14no enemies in Peaceful
Invi: Oh, I dont hate Bronies and some other people... just a lot of people are douchebags nowadays..
prince-lemon! You're reign of tyranny ends today!
0,14*your
FlareChaser welcome to my world ^^
I've gotten lost a couple of time already - luckily I build my house tall on a hill so I can spot it from a disctance
FlareChaser: Kids. Kids are AWFUL today.
prince-lemon: say my name so I can get a 100 ping points.
and then my rebellion ended because of a typo
05,15So during this break I decided to play the impossible game and it's level packs. Beat them all...now what
Reikim: I know.
Nittany_Discord: XD aww
hey fellow bronies, i have a stupid question to ask :'( : Is there no stream at the moment or is it just me ? :(
fluttercry: beat it again?
fluttercry: Such a BOSS
Bromany: No stream.
Reikim not my 3 cousins. they are awesome ^^
0,14mfw there's a TV Tropes L4D drinking game
fluttercry, do it again on stream?
Cipher...how does one play?
thx reikim
Back in a bit. :)
0,14http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/Left4Dead
11,01Lightning has pretty much stopped.
11,01Still raining.
There's a drinking game for everything - I got several that include my favorite movies :)
Invi: Okay, revision of statement: The majority of kids these days are awful, self-obsessed jerks, though there are exceptions and usually they grow out of it by age 18 or so.
Thanks, Cipher.
11,01I still expect a random thunderclap or two.
0,14Np
Now I've got something to do.
Some are quite impossible to get through without getting blind drunk before the end
Reikim right, but I'm not sure about that growing out of it....
11,01And lightning.
Thunderclap reduced ma speed .0.
Invi: I say that for the sake of my own sanity. Because I could not take the world otherwise.
05,15Take a sip every time Francis says: "I hate [X]."
05,15^ IMPOSSIBRU
0,14SO

hey Shizuka
Came back at a good time.
How about soda?
/me back from lurking
11,01I failed a tank.
Shizuka: If I took a drink every time I failed anything, there would not be enough alcohol.
MFW cider is alcoholic here
So we do condone drinking. :>

Oh god yes! This YTP!
Can someone tell me what site that is?

In my opinion, this whole scootaloo = chicken has gone too far.
Om: 3 quickly will get me tipsy. You need about 6 in a night for me to be drunk. 8-12 I'm still capable. After that I begin to lose memory, so I can't guarantee anything. :D

Soital, you are a Prinplup.

Scootaloo is proud to be a chicken. You should all be motivated by her commitment to who she really is.

It's one of those many movies that I kept hearing nothing but good things about but hated every minute of it when I finally watched it... on Brony State.
Shizuka is a pet now? O.O I always thought those stories about locking her in the code room were just rumours...

GilDash: Sounds like it.
why didn't you like it Kandarihu
13after this i'm voluntarily going to the code room so redesign a site of mine

RaveBrony: nothing
Hey SparklyWaffles :P
dat valve
Oh, ok
oh L4D2
Hey everypony. :)

oh Nittany is playing again

Has anyone went to the BronyCon Q&A Livestream?
Reikim: .....no :|
/me likes both techno and classical :)
Just 'bout to end :P
GilDash: And you were bored.
hi there, pinkiePry
The protagonist was nothing but a jerk. And the portrayal of the principal made HIM out to be a villain. As if skipping school like this was somehow a noble thing.
/me no :|
Hi PinkiePry
=/ interesting mod
Kandarihu, Ferris Wheeler?
..... ok how did you put ponies there, teach me
FlareChaser: Yes. If it's done right, it can work incredibly well. And I very much enjoy both genres.
Im listening to some Mozart right now O.o
Om: *Very* bored. THere was *nothing* to do. :D
Ferris Beuller
1,3Our next matchup is...
oh boy
05,15Kandarihu the movie wasn't about Ferris. It was about how his actions made Cameron and everyone around him grow
CMON KIRZ! I NEED TO PLAY!
FlareChaser: Or if nto classical then orchestral at least, if you like your definitions kept straight.
Really? Okay.
GilDash: Even so, I am sure you could have found something better to do than getting besotted. Then agian what do I know.

Woodenfan mods vs viewers L4D2
Jaketehsnake...time restricitons for one of the members
Shamroc, Ah. Carry on then
Om: There was *nothing* interesting for about 20 miles. The only thing we did expect for playing cards and badminton was go on a 4 hour canal cruise, which was also boring as sin, and extremely hot. :D
it's time to kill that what done doing has to for the good times opf them who are doing
We should do this again sometime, only with TF2 instead of L4D2. Mostly because I actually have that game >.>
today
a 4 hour anal cruise?
Message from bronysith : dont ping him coz he wont be able to answer
Om: I blame God, culture, society, and my dead cat.
how come Onyxia
Will this mod vs viewers happen more often or when the mods will be free on that day/
?
Om: I actually don't have that mentality. I like a couple just to unwind around a crowd, but if I have much more then I just keep going. :D
Reikim: Those work to, I might blame those later.
btw users are gonna win this ;p
alexxm: he said coz he does have 2 monitors
dunno ;o
13kirz and i do games frequently with the viewers you're about to see
Don't get egotistical Shamroc.
Nobody likes a sore winner.

I Place 50 bits on the mods
I place all my bits on the mods, because they're mods.
i just want to hear the song at the end

Darf14, I'll take that bet.The viewers are gonna kick the mods' asses

Ok all bets are in, good luck

Welcome back Michael
1,3if anyone wants to play Civ5 after the L4D2 games, I'll be starting up a game once we're done
I regularaly play with this Viewer team. They will rape. I am just sad I didnt get to join them
A curse on my fluttercry connection.
kirzstryfe: game crashed RIGHT as i got in..
Alone...with the car...

*gulp* I hope I dont loose the bet
Um, this is probably a stupid question, but does Civ V allow simultaneous multiplayer or is it turn-based?
11,01Never again.
GilDash: Or perhaps not xD maybe next time :D
Hold up. I understand the time restraints for this round, but is there going to be another after this?

HOW MANY PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT LITTLE SAD MOMENT?
13bout time i died
0,14I do
Litwick: .. when? what?
Futurama. Jurassic Bark episode. ALL OF THE TEARS.
11,01Calling this one.
11,01That is a sad ep.
0,14700 points behind, still doable
Ahaha Litwick xD
11,01Not against this team.
yup.
Nittany_Discord calling early sounds awfully like a rage quit
0,14ain't over till it's over
well at least you tried
10points for effort
Airpuff: The MUSIC is what makes it even sadder.
Man... this part of the map.. is impossible.. -.-
unfiting music(smile)-check
hi
Litwick: ... i guess... sad music is sad =I
Death and destructiong-check
Zombie mob-check
weeeeeeeeeee
Litwick: Sad music + sad movie... is very.. sad -.-
Why isn't anyone being my friend -Pinkepie
I guess Radioshack chooses good companies to get electrolytic capacitors from
in the electrolytic assortment I got from a local store I see mostly Nichicon capacitors
:| Hunt the hunter
11,01Calling the match =/= rage quit.
õ
kirzstryfe is being.... *Sneaky*
11,01Meaning I'm still playing.
0,14It's still a form of mentally giving up, which will hurt you in the long run, most of the time
Nitty. Win the game for us.
Do it.
xD
Cipher, it's increasing success by lowering expectations
0,14ehh....
how does that even work?
Please all raged-mods. Just turn off your volume in your headset and put somthing stupid on, it will make you feel good.
11,01I'm not doing that, either.
Right
Just trying
11,01Exactly.
Mish, I do this. I usually put on "He-Man's WHATS GOIN ON!" Cheers me up err'time
Lol! :D
bonjour
needs moar horde
0,14oh hai RAWRity
Hey RAWRity
11,01Hi RAWRity
Hai RAWRity
RAWRity: Holla! :)
0,14dem Midnight Riders
whenever i wanna feel like a badass, i put on The Protomen...
xD
*bobs head to music*
I play scary games. You know what I can do on my computer? I can turn off the song on a dowloaded video game, and turn up the music on the internet. Its a scoot-scoot-allo move, but it certianly makes jumpscares funny
wait what? 0_o
So, look what I Found today! http://i.imgur.com/ZvOfU.jpg
When I am already feeling happy, I put on "Catgroove" By Parov Stelar. Makes me even Fucking happier
Nice choice
RAWRity: Omfg not that movie!! xD
catgroove is aweseme
What do you do for RAGE music?
SPIDERMAN.MP4
RAWRity: i dont know if i should feel sorry for you...
Firaga: sorry? THIS IS GLORIOUS
I have exactly 76 ponies on my desktop right now
buddy ponies
KaitoThePony: I have 118
all the narm!
Parov Stelar In general is AWESOME. Chambermaid Swing is my seond chouce
RAWRity: sudenly a wild swan appears and abducts you into another dimension? xD
RWARity, what in celsitia is that?!
Hmmm.. Rage music. Not sure
Mish: .. youre better of not knowing xD
Think I will
I bet i could get that many but my pc is glitchy
Mish: Garzey's Wing, aka one of the most hilariously awful dubs ever.
one of the most nonsensical films ever
And?
11,01I didn't know I became tank.
I also picked up "Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade", but that's for later.
11,01Looked away.
/me sleeps
silly Nittany_Discord
xD
Mish, If I want to make myself even more angry and pujmped, I'll put on Jeremey Soule's "DragonBorn" And If I want to make myself happy again, I'll play Andrew Wk's "Ready to Die"
technically Garzey's Wing isn't a film. It's a 3 episode OVA.
I'll be back again
so much lunging
Whats your faviorte video games,everyone?
Lazers x Zombie
For me, fallout or MC
11,01Don't have one.
For whatever reason.... I'm reading the Tearjerker page on tvtropes. Like an idiot.
Mods turn
Dayum!
Mish Right now, I love the Fallout Series and L4D2. OF ALL TIME, easily Pokemon Red
That lead!
RAWRity: ... well.. no matter what it is.. it is terrible.. xD
Mish: Castlevania: Symphony of the Night :)
Good luck guys
Mish: Really hard to say.
Oh yus :D\

Oh man, I cant watch >_<

I can't find out how to get to Galaxy News station. >_<
Mish, Lately, when I am feeling happy, another 'Get Pumped' Song has been the "I DO NOT NEED A MICROPHONE" PMV
:) \
Jake, got any suggestions for How to find the entrance to The radio station?
I dont think peaceful mode is completely uninhabited - the deeper I went into the cave system, the more noises I heard O_o
Mish in FO3?
yeah
Because I will give you the gist of what happens to me
Mish On your own, or following the Main Quest Line?
oh I followed the quest line
Well, I took the Metro system there each time I played through.

Shizuka..i swear you gotta stop being negative....your REALLY good....compared to flare and koleef..

11,01Shizuka is hard on herself like me.
kirzstryfe is this game open for noobs?

For all Regular Show fans, there is slightly less than 24 hours until the new episode, "Dead at Eight".
Chrysalis...im gonna be in it
Shamroc you couldn't hug a robot designed for receiving hugs without making it blow up.

Meanwhile...well im insulted

/me heals Shamroc
Shamroc: Pick yes or no.
yes
whats my prize?
also Shizuka is best ninja.
Iheartponi: I really don't care, it's not a good show (imo). TOO FREAKING SURREAL and the humor I can't get around. It's like TOTALLY RADICAL on steroids
you din't break a law, you made an infraction!
1,3it'll be open to anyone that wants to play
Now guess what termonlogy i got thouse 3 qoutes from, aka the book
Iheartponi: well i find it hilarious

Shamroc: Perhaps we'll do an "our team vs" episode :P
oops, mesed up on the smiley
Meanwhile...lol
Firaga, it was a relabeling of the usual Saturday Night Anime block (most of which are shit), and they used it to boost ratings

Nittany_Discord: im inn for one once x)

Shamroc, Deal, but I get to swap out for Bronysith. I play just as much as he does.
Jaketehsnake: not with us...
GAH MY FUCKING BACK IS KILLING ME. I FEEL LIKE AN OLD PERSON.
11,01Bronysith: Yep.
Woodenfan: well as far as i know they needed the ratings if they want to keep airing toonami
Jaketehsnake: You can't hit like Bronysith can. Even if half his targets are cars.
true
Nittany_Discord....darn already closed my game.....
Nittany_Discord: i love all the ponies. but twilight sparkle is my fav i guess

I plan on heading to my local used bookstore soon. THey had the complete series of Berserk on DVD!
11,01CoD has killstreaks, which unbalanced the game towards campers and skilled people.
Me neither, unless they cheat
well yeah i do, but is less often than losing against AI
Nittany_Discord: cod is just camp in one corner and win
Invi: Whatcha mean?
I don't know. I am just kind of sad now.
unbalance towards skilled people....
does anyone here play Tribes?
Nittany_Discord: and u have to listen to whiny little brats all day long

GilDash: Ahaha okei then, you're just hoping for a sick pc? :D
BRONIES ARE 20% cooler than everyone else
Supersaga or his mum is a brony and wanted to troll the teen by buying that shirt ^^
Bronysith: Now now, let's love and tolerate ;)
Petrified_Discord: lol Teens react to prom i think
Petrified_Discord: i never said i was hating
we are better though
Airpuff: Basically. I'll get it up and running and probably just leave room for improvement. Don't need to do it all at once. ;)
Invi: that to XD
Bronysith: Humility is a virtue in and of itself, though :)
Wrek-ing Ball is my favorite Skylander.
GilDash: Thats more like it xD
Petrified_Discord: true
See the short preview of "Dead at Eight". The clip is similar to a scene from Episode 109.
Supersaga or he doesn't know what it means and just bought the shirt ^^

Ahahaha three monitors GilDash ? xD
Invi: lol man that would be ironic
I'm contrabanding!
I AM getting two monitors tomoorw
Firaga: My friend in high school was actually telling me that there's a really annoying brony there now
Two monitors are fun, I screwed around with a pair once
Airpuff: Why the hay not? :D
Petrified_Discord: then hes not a real brony
Firaga: Apparently he's been giving us a bad name :(
Sumica: u sound like saberspark
GilDash: Isnt two enough? xD
GilDash: See i'm not the only one who thinks its excessive
dun dun dun
Airpuff: At my last job I actually had 2 monitors and genuinely needed more space. WIth all that I do at home on the PC, three would be really useful. :D
Someone ping you Sumica? Okay.
Sumica: he did ballad of the brony

Firaga: god of war 3
Though honestly, I'd rather avoid being degraded via PM because someone doesn't like what I did
Cipher just saw who Fez is and his voice, do i really sound like that ?
GilDash: maybe.. you could start making novels.. where each screen is equvivalent to a letter.. thus one letter per screen! Fantastic idea isnt it?
0,14well, you did at one point >.>
been there, done that
Bronysith: already beaten it on Chaos mode even
Princess_Molestia: Where's my minion when I need him! :|
Firaga: try chrono trigger
Airpuff: I was thinking research, the novel, and whatever else I'm doing all at once. :)
Cipher well i was right to hate my voice then ._.
Petrified_Discord: Bronysith is not my minion. he is my student... a lustfull one at that
Bronysith: well its been a while since i played it, so sure why not

Ponies47: But u liek capslock? :3
Mutterguy: You've got hooves. A good buck is all you need. :)
they let him go on ransom, I believe
Om: .. that gives me a so much bigger reason to not go to bed xD
GilDash: Its worth the risk. Lazars are forever
that and since hamlet framed rosencrantz and guildenstern they had another target
Om: Nah, phasers are the future. 24th century, baby! :)
Airpuff: Its your sleep you are loseing

Airpuff: You faid
I really think they treated Trixie unfairly. I mean, even though her magic wasn't great, it served its purpose: some nice visual effects (even though it did repeat a lot). Why were they so mean to her?
Om: Can I come over to inspect these lazars of yours? ;)
Howdy OmegaMetroidBrony.
Om: .... no ._.
0,5Hello Mein Turtle

still need to see that one
Ride that horde!
I wish I could have caught the L4D2 stream. I had to run a long errand.
Om: You're just afraid you're a silly filly. :p
11,01It was a good stream.
I sure had fun playing lolz
GilDash: I know I am silly, but that would be getting off topic
Nittany_Discord: Oh sure, rub it in my face why don'tcha ;).
Om: I dissent again. :)
I also showed him Winter Wrap up and Smile. Smile, Smile. I thought Smile, Smile, Smile would get him. :( He has listened to 3 episodes now. Ya'll would think he would of caved in by now :(
0,14well, I'm off
11,01Everlasting_Joy: Dunno. Getting beat twice?
0,14later folks, enjoy the stream
Bye Cipher!! :)
Bye Cipher

Bye FlareChaser
Bai Cipher and FlareChaser
Om: You seem awfully attracted to my head tonight. ;)
Ponies47: if he didnt like smile smile smile, then i think the mission failed, sorry :(
Nittany_Discord: I wasn't here for it, so I wouldn't know.
Is this Dungeon Defenders?
Hi guys!
Thor 2
Bai everypony see ya tommoroz
0_o which mod is LagnaTheStreamedge?
:P
11,01Uh oh.
Hey SayWhat
11,01Hope my game didn't crash.
Later |Discord|.
Bai |Discord|
03LOL what
03also HML
03you might find this funny
=_(\
The crystals have been douvled!
yes?
Howdy SayWhat.
:o
03I found ana ctual use for Chrome
GilDash: Its a odd feat to behold
03http://bd-hell.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-remove-facebook-timeline-and.html
Well he really wasen't paying attention to it. Maybe if he took a closer listen maybe he woyld like :) I should him A Friend in Deed
03can't find a Firefox equivalent
03and EW TIMELINE
:P
> People complaining abotu stuff not being on Chrome
Ponies47: Worng episode. lul
> Chrome has something really useful that isn't on Firefox
U mad web?
/me cleans his M16
03well
that is only just ONE thing
03because Chrome isn't open source, I can't find a way to download the extension as a file and edit it
Finally! After hours of work, my OC isss!!!....... at 5% completion....
x_x
Nice!
DRF, chromium
03FF has .xpi files, and you can download them in like any browser
03well
SayWhat: He has listened to 3 episodes by now. You would think he would cave in by now :'(
03can you get that extension as a file for me?
I think I should get this game
Om: Want to come for a closer look? ;)
I remember doing that
...
.crx
okay
:D
GilDash: You could see it for miles, don't want to get crushed.
03well
03it's odd
Ponies47: The bravery is strong in this one...
03apparently Timeline doesn't pwork on IE6 or 7, so people were saying to use a user-agent switcher
2 EQD updates in 5 minutes
03but I tried IE6 on a XP machine, and it had timeline even though it was begging me to update
Ponies47: Or he's dug too far deep into Narnia, if ya catch my drift
Om: Don't be shy now, you're obviously interested. ;)
Microsoft is begging to give Internet Explorer a second chance
through ads now
03let's try like IE4 or whatever Windows 98 has :P
/me pushes Om to GilDash
GilDash: Afraid and terified I would say
What the crap is going on? 0_0
Ponies47: theres one suggestion, talk to him, maybe theres something bothering him to prevent him from watching the show
quick question
is it weird that i want to be tested on
like drug wise
I wonder if he does like the show but is scared to tell me. I think he's probley in stage 4. He is watching the show 1 part is enjoying it while the other is saying it's wrong :(
Wii shit, next inovation
Bronysith: Well, it pays.
Ponies47: See now, you can't stuff it down his thoat, let it ease in
Om: Do I have to let you borrow my sense of adventure? ;)
oh shit Everlasting_Joy is here.... my cousin failed the airstrike lol jk
SayWhat: agreed
GilDash: I don't think that is possible.
SayWhat: I think I should back off for a while and see if he'll come to me :(
Everlasting_Joy: seroiusly praise is nice and shit. but the constructive crits help me better
Does this game ever end or does it just go until you lose?
Bronysith: Muahahaha! Your cousin hasn't gotten back yet I see. . . He hasn't told you my terrible secret.
Om: I'd be willing to give it a shot. ;)
Bronysith: In other words, you're happy?
Ponies47: Yeah, don't bring it up unless absolutely necissary, or if he brings it up
Everlasting_Joy: ya. you showed me the flaws
10 pm EST|7 pm PST.
GilDash: I'm not willing to let you try, that fat head of yours would eat me.
Everlasting_Joy: i wasnt trying to be the next tolkien in terms of great writing
thattl be in the book im writing
SayWhat: True. Maybe I should talk to him and ask him why he hatesm it so much.
Bronysith: Just because you aren't going to be the next Tolkien doesn't mean you can't improve your writing.
fanfic is just for practice
Om: Are you calling me fat now? :|
*hates
Everlasting_Joy: i know but this fanfics are for practice really
oi
GilDash: Is that a problem?
http://layouts-skins.com/layouts/fb_timeline_disabler.crx < try this
Sumica: one does not simply get support
Note: never force someone to become a brony, thou thy must learn for themselves
/me kisses Om.
Om: I don't know, Omffee. Is it? ;)
dawwww
>Implying people need to be forced.
http://blazomania.com/wp-content/uploads/TimelineRemove/TimeLineRemove.crx < or this
I love how Sumi's voice is louder
I'm goiung to do my part in less RP by ignoring that GilDash
you must become a brony by choice
huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
a brony chooses. a slave obeys
03hm
not sure which is the real as the download for the actual crx is too fast for me to copy paste away before it gets deleted
OBEY ME!
03is there a way to edit those?
03just see how they work etc
Bronysith: And heck, I didn't address all the flaws, there might have been some I don't even know about.
Everlasting_Joy: okay lets stop there
new discussion
Om: Tsk, you're such a suck up. ;)
PIE
Hi everybody!
hiya pikorar
Hi pikorar
Bronysith: Fair enough.
just use 7zip
FillyFlam: forceing someone to watch mlp is considered a brony nazi in the urdandictionary
I swear they're just zip files
pikorar: I'm totally asleep! :D
GilDash: Thats how I got though school
Bronysith: I wasn't even going to start another critique, I was just noting.
My bro has listened to 3 episodes now. He still doesn't like. or does he like it?
03ah
Everlasting_Joy: but yes. i am going to write a book later on in life. when i learn better writing techniques
Om: You need to lighten up more. ;)
hey pikorar
Why does this game remind me of Jimmy Neutron
I can see that, GilDash, which is why you're totally not on right now and I miss you.
SayWhat: graphics
GilDash: I turned on my lamp. Happy.
Hey pikorar
pikorar: I'm glad that you understand that and obviously can't read what I've written right now. :D
Bronysith: I don't know... It's something about the characters :P
Hi everyone.
Hi pikorar
Yeah, GilDash, I wish I could've read it, but I can't.
Om: I was thinking of something else to turn on... ;)
A light, GilDash?
pikorar: That's a shame, isn't it? You know, if you could read this.
Ooh, ooh! Is it an iPad, GilDash! It's an iPad!
03brb reboot
I am just too smart for my own safety...
I'm happy and sad. I'm happy because this is my last week of school :) I'm sad because I can't make my bro a brony :(
I know that feel bro
btw, hey guys
Ponies47: u cant make anyone a brony
Don't worry about your bro, bro.
Bronysith: Thank you :). Believe it or not, I have a hard time picturing people in books, so seeing a picture, especially from the artist, helps.
Straisin: hi
Hi Straisin, I love you!
I ipad for chat is not all that, for the lack of Tab is quite bad </Zecora>
pikorar: <3
No no no, if you're going to pitch something, you have to do it as Billy Mays.
GilDash: How bout... no. And if that wasn't clear. No way in hell
I managed to introduce the show to ONE friend
Ponies47: some reasons he may not like the show is because hes either a closet brony or he may have problems in the outside world to prevent him from liking it
Everlasting_Joy: yea. Jennidash did the pony. and valoreins from bronystate made the human form
I have afriend in denial, he said he'd concider if I can get my friend to play LoL, but he'l only play LoL if I play Battlefield with him
I introduced to show to 3 friends, and have 8 brony friends IRL.
Om: I was under the distinct impression it was my kind of hell. ;)
Bronysith: True. But the thing is he has listened to 3 episodes and a bunch of other pony stuff
just don't force it on them and they kinda start to soften up, in my case anyways
Everlasting_Joy: i like how young the human form works. he is 19 after all
Ponies47: ooh. yea hes a brony
GilDash: That's the extra cranium you are packing speaking.
Sumica: harpoon ftw
Bronysith: What do you mean by that?
pikorar: Clever ponies will be ignored when it is convenient. :D
No, really, don't push it. If he hasn't accepted it by this point then he just doesn't want to be a brony.
Ponies47: I think that makes him a brony by definition lol
btw, what game is wrek playing?
Everlasting_Joy: what? alexx is 19 and 20 in my fanfic lol.
I think he's playing The Game.
D:
pikorar: u lost
Bronysith: Umm. . . never mind.
Everlasting_Joy: okey dokey lokey mokey kokey smokey
F*** you Bronysith
kinda looks like sanctum?
Mutterguy: wat?
well, the gameplay anyways
Bronysith: :D
superretroworld: I sort of think he's a brony. But he's upset about it :(
Om: Aw, come on. I'm just the kind of pony you need to warm up to. ;)
/me lost too
would anyone like to add me on steam?, i mostly play team fortress on weekdays (whenever i get to use my sis comp) so anyone?
Just go on Google and type in "What game is Wrek playing right now?" because Google knows everything. EVERYTHING.
/me warms up to GilDash
Everlasting_Joy: is it worse then the prequels?
Everlasting_Joy: that is all i need to know
hiya Biglaw
Hiya Bronysith
Bronysith: Oh lord no, see, this wasn't trying to destroy anything.
Ponies47: maybe because he doesnt want his parents or even you to know
/me pulls Biglaw back away from GilDash "Dont ruin this for Om..."
pikorar: :D
Everlasting_Joy: okay good. that was my goal. to not suck
my friend called me a fag cuz i like mlp :c
GilDash: I don't think you are.
Everlasting_Joy: as bad as the prequels
my brother gives me shit for it :/
but meh
DrPug: all of my rage
Om: Of course I am! Who else is as kind and caring as I am? ;)
DrPug everypony has their opninion, and you most certainly arent a ***
DrPug: how dare he say that word
Irish_Pony: Why are you suppoting this >.>
Bronysith: I think he is. Like I said he listend to a (squee) load of pony stuff today because we where both sitting in the same room and I had the computer. :)
I have friends that hate the fact that I am a brony, but they still like me
okay den Ponies47
GilDash: A lot of people, none of which are so persistant!
Me too CupcakeWarrior.
At least one of my friends doesn't mind I'm a brony.
05THIS IS A GREAT SONG
:p
Om just stip resisting...she just loves fighters...it makes her victory that much sweeter...;)
Wrek: true
Om: It's only because I care, Omffee. :)
But I can't complain because I still have 8 brony friends. Swag.
I havea friend that would probably beat my family if they found out I was a brony, but not me ;) We're good friends
I need to have pony/gaming marathons when I get to summer vacation
Ponies47: dont try to force him to watch them, it never works
superretroworld: Guess I'll have to find out the truth. :|
Hey Wrek! I'm listening to eBay by weird al!
Firaga: this*
pikorar: You're like a strutting peacock. ;)
Biglaw: wtf
Irish_Pony: I think you have some typos
Wrek: u getting dark souls when it releases on pc?
Firaga: I know. He listened to so much pony today I thought he would cave in :(
pikorar: lucky, none of my friends are bronies, but one of them did mention derpy
Bronysith whaat? It's a good song!
I have 3 brony friends, but one of them moved away :(
CupcakeWarrior everypony will go their own way
CupcakeWarrior: hugs?
GilDash: I'm sure you do, as to what you care for. I am uncertain.
Om 1. You get the idea 2. IM DRUNK! YOU DONT HAVE AN EXCUSE!
/me hugs Bronysith
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
I like that simile, GilDash. Makes me feel beautiful. But yeah, I'm just emanating swag right now, my ego is as huge as... I'm not good with similes but it's pretty big.
They sound like nerds, but then again, I sound like a nerd when video games are involved
Irish_Pony: Fair enough -_-
There's one other brony at my school and 2 pegasisters. But none of them like to talk to me :'(
SayWhat: The better question is, what is wrong with that?
Om: Everypony, Omffee. Especially the stubborn ones. :)
pikorar: Maybe I'll have to crash you to the ground. ;)
ouch
Everlasting_Joy: Nothing, I find it amusing when normal people don't know what the hell I'm talking about. ;)
GilDash: You are the stubborn one.
AAAAAAAAAAH
I never thought I would hear an ad with out of phase stereo
SayWhat: :D
I do bring my pony toys to school with me though
it literally hurts
are they going to stream old dr who in the summer?
Peacocks can't fly GilDash.
Om: Immovable object meets irristable force. What a predicament. ;)
pikorar: the ones i make can
I have no pony stuff :( I need to get some :(
Me too :(
Ponies47: huh, I didn't know bronies would be the ones to ostracise, but there's jerks in every fandom I guess
out of all the 6 people in my school i know are bronies, 1 is me of course, 3 of them have been my best friends since grade school, and the other two are batshit insane, so i keep my distance from them
pikorar: No, but they're pretty damned pretty. ;)
DD right?
Yep
I don't, but that's because I'm not obsesive and I don't want to give into the corporate part of Hasbro and MLP.
Firaga: how so?
flutter_spin: hiya
WELCOME to the herd AllisZero
hi guys!
heya flutter
GilDash: I don't think the phrase uses irrisistable
Hi flutterspin_spin! I love you!
woot!
Om: Shame. I did. :)
/me flaunts his feathers at GilDash. "I hope you like what you see."
watching Wrek eh?
GilDash: Must be your big head messing things up again.
finals in 2 hours? NOPE, PONIES
Biglaw: when is ur next chapter?
/me glomps pikorar
PONIES!?
pikorar: I think you should know that by now. ;)
PONIES!
Where!?
Straisin: one is a girl who has been know for having mental issues, and the other i known since kindergarden and has always been annoying as buck, he also has no sense of personal space
GilDash it's actually unstoppable
Om: Or maybe it's your teeny one that cannot comprehend. ;)
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/705/ Sumica
Firaga: oh :/ I've seen a lot of people just claim to like ponies to be ironic or "unique"
Omg why.....
GilDash: I am perfectly content with that.
Straisin: I think he is one but he's to scared to tell me. I was the same when I first became one. Anthor brony convinced me to come outta my shell and now everybody in my family accpect for dad knows I'm a brony.
It sounds like val is having a hard time
!pokemon
Om: It's a shame I like trying to teach ponies things then. ;)

you guys are lucky to have brony friends at your skool, i have no brony friends, so im kinda lonley :(
Speaking of ponies, today I had to drive through the neighborhood where I'm going to be living in a few months to check out the progress on the house and there are like 8 or so friggan ponies just walking along the roads, and people everywhere just gawking at them, and I had to maneuvre around them at like 5 MPH, and I couldn't honk my horn at all... Pfft, ponies.
Ponies47: you kinda learn to stop giving a crap as time passes
lol piko
Real life ponies suck. :C
GilDash: Guess I am unteachable. You should give up.
pikorar: You can honk your horn at me whenever you want. ;)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v7OdxFxQLw&feature=relmfu Does this clip from the RS episode tommorow remind you of anything from Episode nine?
/me hugs superretroworld
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4750/
Om: It's a bad teacher that gives up on a student. ;)
Ew, Regular Show .-.
that's a very nice cake you got there
brony sith
no links and no cpypasting comments Iheartponi
Straisin: I'm to scared to tell my dad. BUT I'M A BRONY AND I'M PROUD! :)
hugs back Firaga
woo
Dear god why...I type in Late Cadence USMC and get Princess Cadence :S:|:[
Ponies47: same
Ponies47 thats the spirit!
GilDash: Then you should have no troubles :)
GilDash: do you plan on becoming a teacher?
My dad will eat my soul if e finds out I'm a brony
Firaga: u just been bad boy
And I'm pretty sure my brother is but he hasn't told me :3
SayWhat: i cant tell my dad im a brony... hes a republican
Bronysith: wut?
Firaga: nothing
EVERYPONY IS PROUD TO BE A BRONY! FOR THAT YOU GET A BROHOOF! :)/)
Bronysith, as is mine
Om: Nope. You'll learn one day. ;)
Ponies47: /)
21 hrs and 48 minutes until RS.
GilDash: But not one day soon.
superretroworld: Ah, no. :D
My dad found out I'm a brony a few months ago and surprisingly enough, he didn't care and simply said "yeah, My Little Pony was pretty popular when I was young." I was pleasently surprised.
I HATE POLITICS!!!!!
Ponies47: /)
Om: I've got all the time in the world. ;)
Bronysith: But he wrestles, so I can play the "wrestling" card.
GilDash: But whyyeeee
Bronysith: then you hate obama?
Om: Why not? ;)
...
superretroworld: anything politics related
no, he hates politics lol
superretroworld: i hate it
superretroworld: so eys
He hates TALKING about politics.
GilDash: I'm not worth eeet
pikorar: Doesn't everypony? :D
Not my mom.
someone derail the chat before we get all political
Om: I refuse to believe that. :)
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON and think. *Goes to THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON*
Firaga: I can work on that. :D
obama is pretty kewl, donates stuff and doesn't afraid of anything
i dont mind politics, but i cant stand learning it, fucking civics
Well Scarecrow, you do an awful lot of talking for someone without a brain! Well a lot of people do a lot of talking without brains! *points to congress*
Straisin: where does he get the money to donate?
GilDash: That is the propper use of dissent
And Obama supposedly supports gays. I can't hate on that.
pikorar: Not sure if should make a mom joke... :D
*Comes back to earth* I've got nothing. :(
MY MOM!
pikorar: he probably just said that to get more votes on the next election
Straisin: let me rephrase that, ran a charity and doesn't afraid of anything
/me noms pikorar's mom
But that's not gonna give him many more votes because 90% of gays already vote democratic.
Om: See, we can teach each other. ;)
He's not going to win, I can already see that.
CupcakeWarrior, that's slightly suggestive, but I lol'd.
GilDash: I retract my previous stantement.
Om: Too late. ;)
Bronysith: let me rephrase that, ran a charity and doesn't afraid of anything. derp
FUCK REPUBLICANS AND FUCK DEMOCRATS AND ESPECIIALY fuck politics in general
I'm a Libertarian.
What's a stantement? Is that a brand of potatochip?
at least politics in the us arent as fucked up as they are here in mexico
I'm independant!
Straisin: but where did he get the money? from taxes that hte people pay
Does this game ever end?
pikorar: That's because politics is about the face and not the policies... No, I will not discuss politics! :D
I'm socially liberal but economically republican
from the people who donate to charities lol
I'm talking about before his presidency
poor Bronysith :D
<_< >_> why are you talking politics...
The only one that makes sense -_-
You know I think my bro is a brony. Because while he was listening to all the pony stuff he did laugh a couple of times. hmmmmm?
21 views. That's it from my fanfic. I don't know what to think about that.
BECAUSE WE LIKE TO RAMBLE
Sumica: ALL OF THE DISTRACTIONS
GilDash: Its never to late!
I have some non-brony friends who still like some brony things, like the .MOV videos.
Om: Omffee, yes it is. ;)
Everyone liikes the .MOVs
But those are fun for the whole family!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2961/
pikorar: MOV for the family? Yeah, maybe not. :D
Maybe its too long. 20k words is a lot :P
GilDash: Damn
FAMILY.MOV
yay... my Demon Hunter is lvl 26 now and i just finished act 2... suck it Belial
I showed my bro Apple.Mov the only thing he liked was how Jappleack said (Squee) YOU I CAN ALL THESE APPLES!
pikorar: I showed a person a .MOV and he didn't even know what MLP was. He then asked what it's from and watches waiting for blood and shit
Om: I'm not building a damn for you. ;)
So he says :|
SayWhat: probably not a good idea to introduce people to ponies by .MOVs
It's the best idea
03oh hey, HML
I have a friend who I tried to introduce to MLP but he didn't even know what a meme was and pronounced the word "me-me" and I just gave up right there.
03TimelineRemove has a firefox version
03:P
GilDash: That is a relife to hear.
ugh. Not .MOVs
meh meh
the .Movs are annoying... i dont find them funny at all
the first one was good
pikorar: I said it like that when I was 8 =/
Relife? Like a 1-up?
the others, not so much
03also hahahahaha I tried to share the link on Facebook, and it said it was rejected for being a "spammy site"
03XD
lololol:P
pikorar: i live in mexico, everyone calls them that way here
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ep3pu5OB1r3xauuo1_1280.png
pikorar: U DONT SAY
The .Movs are not bad. I showed my bro other pony stuff BEFORE showing him Apple.Mov
My chat was derped
Bronysith: did you send me a invite?
pikorar: hed probaly liek fighting is magic :D
Darkts3: wat

SayWhat: only molestia can send me to the moon. shes my master so that will not happen

Litwick: You are not a mod therefore yo have no control over bronysith or anyone else. Get over it
AS MUCH AS I LIKE HER TUMBLR, YOU SPAMMING HER FUCKING PAGE IS GETTING ANNOYING.
GilDash: I've heard...
well
in mint 9
I could click
not really spamming her page
and a clock would appear
Firaga: I'm gonna back off for a while and see if he'll come to me. :)
03Haha

Done! I have finished le ice-cream, and your words can harm me no longer.
That actually had seconds
this is spam
03"Foreign affairs: hooking up overseas"
pikorar: I'm not afraid of a little smiting. ;)
But, those pics are implying R34, so...isnt that against the rules?
03best movie ever
but cinnamon is still in its early dev stages
lol. Better do what he says Bronysith
so it doesn't have it
Superretroworld: I agree :)
and I don't want seconds in the taskbar
Om: So you've nothing to worry about. ;)
flutter_spin: okay?
ouch
Bronysith.. just to be fair the mods might see it as a bannable offense. it probably isn't wise to to link that here
pikorar: the*
well, gotta wait then
:s
Mutterguy: um oky
GilDash, I'm not afraid of a sticky situation. I usually just eat my way out... C:
Bronysith: You should probably stop, I would be sad if you got banned :(

GilDash: That is quite alright.
Hi CeilingKirz
pikorar: I should think so. You'd leave me disappointed otherwise. ;)
Then don't correct my art, Firaga. >:L
im done CeilingKirz
Bronysith can not get into trouble or will not stop until the mods ask him to and here is why. He does not care about other peoples opinions unless those opinions can get him kicked or banned. There ya go
Om: No, no, I insist. :)
|Discord|: let me speak for my own damn self
pikorar: i just find the "le" thing annoying as hell, nothing personal sugarcube
CeilingKirz: sry
GilDash: Nooo, no insisting! Its a-okay!
Firaga, don't call me sugarcube, darling.
Everypony loves Bronysith :) It would be really sad if he got banned :'(
Bronysith: But don't you want someone else to do it for you as so you will not have to waste time explaining
pikorar is best sugarcube
pikorar: dont call me darling, sweetie pie
|Discord|: fine
flutter_spin... iwant her to catch the muffins
Ponies47: It would be very sad :'(
Don't call me sweetie pie, honey bunch.

Om: I've already got everything sorted. :)

Don't you see the sines? The terrible puns are incoming.

superretroworld: Ick....that guy in the vid is just wrong :D but... i suppose its how the world sees us...
:\
HA! I'm watching avideo on Youtube! The ad is MLP FIM Stuff! :D
11,01Too much channel RP = maid hour having to be cancelled (possibly for good).
10Thanks
11,01People are coming here thinking that this is an RP channel.
what the hell was maid hour
oh.
1,3why does this idea that bronystate is going to hell keep popping up?
03what movie?
11,01We're not.
Well, in lighter news, LOOK WHAT I FOUND http://i.imgur.com/P18YW.jpg
10Inception
03ah
10because
11,01Just have an issue with RP.
CeilingKirz: people like to try and predict downfalls.
10we found it downstairs, still in wrapped in its plastic covering
RaveBrony: ikr, just because we watch mlp doesnt mean were liek that guy in the video, and thats especially why i hate FOX cause they attacked us
Nittany_Discord: So where should we direct the people who wanna RP?
03LOL
11,01Somewhere else.
10We got it for my dad during Xmas... movie was in 2010
Nittany_Discord: Helpful
Petrified_Discord: point your arms 8 different directions and say "that away"
uhmm true
10hm
superretroworld: Ikr!! Geez, that FOX (anything but)News....
1,3there are a few channels on the network dedicated to RP
Nittany_Discord: Then why not create a RP channel?
10Could have been sitting in their for a year
/me checks
hen3ry: Okay *goes off to acquire more arms*
10...yeah
RP?? Where? O_o
1,3they can be found either on the list of channels on www.ponychat.net, or you can use /list to bring up the channel list
03well if it came with a digital copy, you missed it :P
11,01Yeah.
10Unopened DVD for over a year LOL
/me didn't even know about that :O
Huh

10But whatever, great film
Just So You Guys Know, if I ever become a streamer on here, I'm streaming this: http://i.imgur.com/ZvOfU.jpg
10Definitely my top fav
1,3and the idea of a Bronystate RP channel has been brought up before, but it was felt that it would be seen as encouraging RP in the main channel by its very existence
Must. resist. posting fanfic link.
03really?
03I mean, it's good sure but not one of my favorites

Y' know what else I want to be streamed? REGULAR SHOW!!!
Bobeh: Turns out there's no such thing as a happy camper :D
Cypresswolf: i hate that statue so much

Firaga: I let the thing out, ran backwards down the hall, trying to put as much distance between me & it as possible - freaked out when it kept regaining ground everytime I blinked - backed through a door frame, tried to close the door before blinking again, but locked myself in the room with it :'(
I seriously Recommend Green to any Rarishy fans
Derpy_Hooves: i love that channel
ME TO
Petrified_Discord: My Parent's didn't take my camping when I was a kid, do you know why? Because they loved me enough to let me sleep in a house on a bed :P

CupcakeWarrior: it could have been worse - I have a link to a 10 hour loop :) Shall I share?
Hi Meanwhile
mario_pony: NO u must swim, eez gud for u
/me gives MahBoi777 a medal just for being awesome http://derpy.me/qsa0t
MahBoi777: but the water is dirty!!
Have own pool, don't have to be around people :)
Attempt to go to sleep, fail spectacularly, can't retry because the birds are singing the songs of their people.
Allo everypony.
lucky
hi Meanwhile
Luna_of_Assassins: someone's rich.
It'd be a bit hard swimming with an assassin's hoodie on though
hi Meanwhile.
SuperBrony64: OMFG I WILL RAID YOUR HOUSE
11,02;<
Petrified_Discord: it's beautiful!:O
No :D... no they built it back in like, the 70's or 80;s
hey Meanwhile!

13hm... so i finally got to that classic cosmos quote...
theres the song that started a fad
Baseball? That's not football.
13if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe
Bum badabum badabumbadabum bum
Meanwhile: =(
Football! YEAH
Petrified_Discord: and? both are good sports, all three of them.
digimon, digital monster, digimon are the champions!!
Carl Segan?
WallDives: lol
mario_pony: I have not thought about that theme song in years.
mario_pony: dirty? ewwwww, you'd better sit on a bench
This game makes it so you never want to get hit
13eeeyup
WAH
I can't cook. I can even burn juice :P
watching mlp with youtube cc is fun
CupcakeWarrior: most annoying sound in the world?
thats kinda longwinded, just to make pie...
The sounds are a bit different than I remember
Ponies47: that actually takes skill
One does not simply make an apple pie from scratch.
I can just hear mario's crying now
MahBoi777: :O
24 points.
This is the hypest shit
Beeping + Crying Baby Mario = ANNOYING
WAAAAAAAAAHHH
/me cries
Unless it's like, Pinkie and AJ's granddaughter
What
Awww
And to think, in the future Mario will kill you just to get a second jump :'(
dat reset
then apple pie could be made from two ponies
almost as annoying as having red health on pokemon
Ponies47: u have to burn it so that it maintains it's structure while keeping the appearance of something burnt. I applaud you
/me resets SuperBrony64
In a galaxy far away
SuperBrony64: not the sad opening again!
MahBoi777: yay. :)
eez not sad
once upon a time, in the magical land of...
/me blows on the cartdridge
11,02Accidentally hit the game cartridge >>
what's sad is u never get to see the parents
lol
/me blows on Luna_of_Assassins
Why is it in fiction involving storks the storks always suck at their job?
SuperBrony64 dawwwwwwwwww :(
you did. it was the Stork...
SuperBrony64 I hate when that happens
SNESes can be so damn touchy. you brush against them and they brick.
It's 6:30a/5:30a UK in europe.
Meanwhile: they like their booze
Mutterguy: NO lol
Ohh this is the SNES version, not the GBA
ahhhhhh
Gameboy cartridges are invincible
there was a gba version?
Firaga: Spose I would to if I had to listen to crying infants all day.
he caught ut like a baws
*it
of this, yah
I had it
Pinkie Pie and Apple Jack's grand father, as in if Pinkie Pie got married and had a daughter, and Applejack got married and had a son and the two offspring married and had a daughter?
Luna_of_Assassins: i only had the super mario world andmario 2 ones
I hate them things
WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH!
I didnt know this game had such awesome musics
Kandarihu: yah
AHHHH
Apple Pie
Or skip that and just have magical lesbian spawn.
Dat 3D pause
like a pirhana plant and a cactus combined
hit the cartridge again?
Earthbound's soundtrack was weird~~~
Pinkie could probably reproduce asexually if she wanted to
PartyCannon: you mean weirdly amazing
1,3o.O
PartyCannon: the entire MOTHER series was weird.
True. Pinkie can spawn additional Pinkie's from her mane.
WallDives: refrain from spoilers please,i still need to beat mother3
Meanwhile: How about Apple Jack giving birth to a filly and Pinkie Pie giving birth to a colt?
/me summons darkspawn
Firaga: wasnt going to anyway.
Pinkie loves herself ?
*Clones himself*
need moar red coins!
/me summons shadowspawn
CupcakeWarrior we know she can bud additional hooves, so that doesn't surprise me
NOW THERE'S 2 OF ME :)
Kandarihu: Not as amusing.
Of course, we dont need any more Pinkies
Pinkie would just curbstomp somepony and an instat clone would shoot out. Those that survive the fall will carry on her legacy.
For a start, that way actually makes sense without magic.
And where's the fun in that.
I need a parallel version of myself from a R63 universe
SuperBrony64: Stop pausing D:
Luna_of_Assassins: wouldnt that be like ...cloping?
aww no way, somepony is playing mario?

I would be perfect for myself :D
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT

Just because she can break the fourth wall doesn't mean she can reproduce asexually.

SuperBrony64: I gues I shouldent dance on the game cartridge then?
It was obviously Derpy's fault
You can dance where you want to DeathStar.
NOT ENOUGH FUN FOR YOU?
MahBoi777: they are just like women, if they stop working just blow on them a little an insert them in nintendo approved products
Meanwhile: you can leave you friends behind?
DerPING AS usual I see

Luna_of_Assassins: Oh god! *hides the spiders*
DeathStar, just do the safety dance
Derpy Doesn't know what went wrong -> :P

I use Zed when I'm spelling over the phone, per the NATO Alphabet
sounds like "Zet" to me, but I have problems with devoicing consonants, apparently.
Luna_of_Assassins: i like Zed a lot more because it reminds me of Lord Zed
What the hay kind of game is this?!
SuperBrony64: You forgot to get the other cards, now you have to start over

SB sure has a weird collection of games
Isnt Peter Pan Robin Williams? Because that looks nothing like him
CupcakeWarrior: I was just pondering that
The game skipped 2/3 of the movie, it might be a short game :)
Stop saying that it doesn't look like Robin Williams!
awesome collection, I never knew any of these games existed lol
It's a goddamn sprite!
CupcakeWarrior: your mom is robin williams
robin williams was too busy at the time playing A link to the past, true story
eww
which makes things pretty awkward
Meanwhile: He is not funny though, not him.
1,3how can you say it doesn't look like Robin Williams?
LOL! $3000 donate to the brony project and Lauren Faust will draw your OC
Firaga: He named his kid Zelda
1,3that green spandex matches exactly :3
Inb4 2d joke.
GO ROBIN!
CupcakeWarrior: I think that they made the game before the movie was released, with little interaction between the studios
so not even the bad guys die in this game
BEES
flutter_spin: someone actually donated $10,000
ded
I saw that.
which is what they used to do when license games weren't automatically terrible
that's insane
kirzstryfe: with that logic your text looks like robin williams
which is stupid
Derpy_Hooves: two people donated 10k
again
which is stupid
Und then kirz was Robin Williams.
Someone has a lot of money on their hands
Derpy_Hooves: its their money, theyre free to do with it as they please. its funding a documentary so its possible thaty have other motives behind just being a brony to do it
1,3all I have to do is ~believe~
other motives besides*
God damn fat kid.
oh shet, he's rollin
:(
Pan: No way, you're not him.
Firaga: yeah I know, but there were some legit good ones
dat fanfare
rolling fat people are unstoppable
/me throws colored pudding at TheRainbowDash
I remember watching an episode where some guy buys a rare bottle for $20,000 ... . .. because he thought it would be fun to have
Huh? Now there is rain?
MahBoi777! Use rollout!
Someone needs to gif his walk animation into a "Haters gonna Hate" pic.
:D
He had NO clue what it was
This feels like a Minecraft world now.
two hits and thats it? man Robin williams is getting old for this crap
Meanwhile: I'll see if I can find the spritesheet
I believe in you kirzstryfe.

Derpy_Hooves: wrong, the original 10k donator has already been contacted in order to make sure that it was a legit donation and he is serious about it. it sounds like you're horribly misinformed and just spouting stuff for no apparent reason

/me noms TheRainbowDash
08,01twilight_sprinkler: she can use her magic to deflect the beam
Derpy_Hooves: don't make baseless statements about something that already has backing and i wont have to disagree with you. to my knowledge, committing to the kickstarter requires that there is sufficient funds in your account at the time otherwise it rejects it. you're allowed to have your own opinions, however, just as you can state yours, i will state mine as well
11,02TROLL LIFE

WHA? No fair.....only AVGN can ragequit......only of it's a shitty game.....CLAYMATES???

Interplay?
The company that Published Fallout published this? ...... wow they sure came a long way
His head is huge

Darf14: wasnt fallout published by black isle studios
BONK

ingwaz: haha have you seen the XKCD comic where he's like "I can't go to sleep... someone is WRONG on the INTERNET!!!"
Dark92Enigma: What?
TheRainbowDash: the 90's were full of weird games
clayton....OH YOU SO PUNNY
Yes, but Interplay had the rights to it
Earthworm Jim for Wii
how surrealistic lol
SuperBrony64: Do you have earthworm jim?
ingwaz: ffs quit trying to attack my opinions, just becasue you ASSUME im wrong doesnt mean i am, now im going to do the right thing and add you to my ignore list
08,01twilight_sprinkler: yup
Cypresswolf: And he does not play and game that was released before the 21st century, pretty much, except for Super Smash Bros.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Interplay_games
11,02On the Genesis I believe CupcakeWarrior
08,01twilight_sprinkler: look it up, it's amazing
TheRainbowDash: You said SB

sonic is now obsolete
Oh, Claymates! I rented ths game once. It was quite a trip
Was that a chaos emerald?
TheRainbowDash: I could dig up my NES collection and share a few, but it requires alot of moving - back of the storage closet
Oh, i see.......so he's streaming TheRainbowDash ?
i gave up on fanfiction a looooong time ago, ahhh good times
ugh. It is well written.
Dark92Enigma: Ugh, nevermind.
Derpy_Hooves: thats your choice. my disagreeing with you is not the same as attacking you. if you see any form of disagreement that way, thats a bit silly really. but don't state opinions which have no backing and not expect no disagreement at all either
Cypresswolf: Oh, cool that you have them old games.
Do you have Plok?
The rat is barking
Havent played the NES since Playstation
dem clouds
Sorry. I just have a hard time reading well written stuff
The oldest console I have is my N64
Well, excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me, TheRainbowDash ! (Zelda Cartoon reference)
ingwaz: Derpy_Hooves: you're both wrong!
wait.... a sonic ring, master emeralds ..... This game stole from sonic :O
my oldest console is NES
The oldest console I have PS1

Shizuka......IM SON CONFUSED HEP ME
my dad inherited to me =)
THE AIR THE TREES THE DIRT! :D
i had a wheel and a stick, and damnit that was the best console game ever
13you are son confused?
Where you could plug a cartridge into the cartridge for more stuff.
13you are not the father
a cat walking on clouds..
Shizuka: so confusd....help me..

Next time on the Maury Shizuka show...
fuck fuck fuck what is this doing to my brain
"My baby daddy 'aint payin his child suppo'
and he doesnt even need glass procesing
And
Meanwhile: hahahah das racist.
"My cousion is my mothers uncle's nephews dad"
What? Ball? what? what? Am I on drugs? Rat turns intob ball?!?! *brain explodes*
*pop*
this game reminds me of worms in terms of level design but less off this is hilarious even though i just got blown up and more of exactly how much have i been drinking again?
and....he died...and has to completly restart...wow
*explodes*
Whats a checkpoint?
yes
1,3yeah, one reason we never rented this more than once
i made it back home in one piece
PUMPKIN, WHAT? WHAT WHAT PUMPKIN? WHAT? -Nostalgia Critic
^
I remember back during that era of gaming. SEGA based their entire marketing push for the Sega Genesis on claiming that the SNES can't scroll nearly as fast as what we just saw.
If you'd like to be featured on the Maury Shizuka show, just dial 555-How-much-did-1-drink.
dem chaos emeralds
TheRainbowDash: few I can remember - we had Duck Tales, Rescue Rangers, some Robin Hood game I never figured out, Bubble Bobble (personal favorite), most of the Adams Family games - yes that includes Fester's Quest *blech*, Little Nemo, TMNT...
Rat turns into Cat turns into ball back into rat ..... seems plausible
Meanwhile......what are you blathering on about?
Sonic ripoff much?
13the shizuka show is broadcast on select planes of existence
Cypresswolf: Duck Tales?! Just that...you win.:D
Shamroc: I'm working a joke to the bone.
13consult your local demigods for listings
Discord is so in on making this world :)
Lol.
Shizuka: I consulted them, they hung up on me.
Looks like a very bad Sonic Rip off
Ducktales! Whoohoo!
/me 08,01wears shizuka
Shizuka: i wish i understood what you were talking about...
Entire Ninja Gaiden series - never beat a single one :P
Shizuka: If we watch it, we will know what you look like 0_0
13obviously shamroc needs to brush up on his great wheel cosmology
08,01you're now a hat
Yep, 49 separate editing passes on chapter 2? what the crap? I did like 6 and I died.... of boredom
err..... whats going on? Im so confused
This is a very very very odd platformer.
Shizuka: my what>
DED
Shizuka's face is like the silence from Dr Who. You forget you saw her once you stop looking.
lol
08,01i wish i could draw; i'd draw shizu as a hat
oh god same music
BRAVO
1,3lol
03from where?
08,01i'd draw a group pic of all the mods as clothing and accessories
13i don't actually exist
13you are all hallucinating
but really Shizuka what are you talking about..
08,01it's probably a good thing that i can't draw.
SB would be a shirt
Shizuka: thats nothing new
Thank goodness.
I thought Shizu was a robot
actually, it might be more useful to watch the spice girls wembely 1998? concert
08,01i would shizubot
and then that cow exploded
*explodes*
I remember we have at least 3 NES console, they kept breaking down
08,01er
08,01minus the "i would"
Shizuka is actually a pan-dimensional being who's true form is not comprehendable to the human mind, so she chooses to appear as a user in an inconspicuous chat room.
1,3the Shizuka is a series of code that compiled itself on a server in the northern US
i'm not nearly drunk enough for this game...
Am I a cow? NO I'M NOT A PONY! :P
aww
03LOL these news people
Dat flop.
dat fail
NUUUU
what is this shizuka you speak of? is it some kind of food
Fail
08,01shizuka is a quine

Firaga: it's a sushi combo
pokemon tournament
03oh
is it some sort of duel monster?
pokemon tournaments
08,01a quine of code.
Maybe Shizuka is Asuka in disguise
Quine sounds like a fruit found at the edge of the world.
The overworld is odd
13baka na..
is it wrong for me to view fanfics just to see people's comments of how bad they are?
08,01Shizuka: yes please, with ice
flutter_spin: i do that all the time
Meanwhile: I'll have a Quine smoothie please
I do it as well, so dont feel bad
It sort of makes me feel better of my fanfic not being seen
Bugs Bunny Birthday Bash my brother Mike & me played alot - it wasnt terrible, but really long
so..how come that mouse can bark
flutter_spin: I want to see your fanfic
08,01inb4 you're all a figment of my imagination

Clearly this is the figment of an ants imagination.
Shizuka is a glass of water

08,01kirzstryfe: i don't get nearly enough sex to be a figment of *my* imagination
i am you and you are me and we are all in here toguether
RRa
Well I guesss having 5 OCs in my fanfic was cool :)
Shizuka: well you can trust cogito ergo sum... unless cogito ergo sum is ALSO a figment of your imagination!
Hai everypony :3

Hello DaringDude!

*Drinks glass* *Throws chocolate milk* *Chocolate milk explodes*
YES
08,01come to think of it, you can't all be a figment of my imagination; there's not enough touching in here for that.
great way to burn some time, Shizuka
</some SG song>
/me hugs DeathStar "dance on anyponies head lately?
i honestly cant believe this is being played... thats awesome

So, the kid gets turned into blue clay, his dad is kidnapped by a half-naked loony in a tiki mask, and he's now under attack by-- well, everything while he absorbs animal spirits or something. Do I have this right?
ohai SuperBrony64 i havent seen u around

/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
why not?
A green stop sign, such logic.
i just got attacked by ancient bacon
aw man I remember when I was a little kid I was a smartass little jerk to everyone, and one time some nerd starting sollipsizing to me and said "there's no way for you to prove to me that you're real" so then I asked him "are you a masochist?" and punched him in the gut.
dis music :d
Shizuka: Is mayonnaise an instrument? :I
00,02^
/me crouches and pounces on Shizuka. 'Hugs!'
Maybe I'll have you and Wrek do something crazy in my next one... if I make another one
08,01ingwaz: but the wrong places... wouldn't be good for me? by definition
00,02i was about to say that Meanwhile
do instruments of torture count?

If the stop sign is green in this world, would the Go sign be red?

..
Darf14: Probably.
SWEEEEEET VICTORY, YEEEAAHH
Oh my gosh, Rampage! That was a fun game :) You play as a giant monster, gorilla, lizard, and a 3rd one I cant remember, and you climb up buildings to smash them down, step on people, tanks, and stuff, even eat people though some victims had negative effects - like eating a nun would result in God striking a lightning bolt at you :D
herro everypony
wheres elmo when you need him
Shizuka: What about horseradish? :I
Why ar you so good at this?

SuperBrony64: Good job!
oh god the music in this game
08,01for example: if you were to lightly stroke my inner thigh... now, that would be a right place. however, if you kicked me in the bollocks, that would be in the wrong place.
i got a dilema i cant think of a mlp related gamertag ....any ideas?
its drilling into my brain

This song is badass
that aint falco!
I think I once had an ear infection with better graphics.
dem polygons
Meanwhile ....uh how?
Meanwhile: SNES bro
Shamroc: Use your imagination.
Meanwhile...im not in my box though
aww yeah peppys voice...
think Dr Mario...
Sweet, Starfox
/me throws a cardboard box at Shamroc.
/me does a barrel roll
BOSS
Meanwhile...not my box..
Nice bomb waste xD
Never played old classic Starfox though, only Starfox 64
Shamroc: Make due.
The boss looks like a penis from the side view
Egad
hmmmmmm, glowing spot seems legit
And yet I have played games on the 360 with worse mechanics
I heard you liek graphics so i spared no expense for these polygons
Poached egg is best egg.
So, anyone else watched Game Of Thrones this night?
This boss makes an appearance in 64, actually
Do a Barrle roll
Om: stay away from the indie game section
press Z or R twice!
Üpöydunami: Is he the alternative boss of the first world?
Meanwhile..................yeah i still dont get it...box isnt working..
Firaga: Or EA xD
Yeah
SuperBrony64: You got an A!
Keep Falco alive and fly through the land rings
Wait... Looks like Starfox 64 was just a damn remake of this!?
a base in an asteroid field is brilliant!
Yep
and then peppy became leader of the starfox command
MahBoi777: Youre right
/me plugs the box in
0_0
11,02Lambo: Duh :P
MahBoi777: totally safe
Well, it was an enhanced remake
STARFOX
/me slaps Shamroc with a rainbow.
http://www.instantsfun.es/doabarrelroll i think this suits the stream perfectly = u=
thats where I put my base. Don't tell anyone tho
Pfft
lol
Oh Peppy
Meanwhile....yeah still nothing..
SuperBrony64: You're a silly filly :3
hey all
I give up Shamroc. You're imaginationless.
something up with the stream?
Shamroc: blow on this boook nd then I'll insert in to the slot at the top
Hello Vulpbrony, the stream works
This is just true http://thedoghousediaries.com/3545
meanwhile...its not that...i ran outa adranaline..
Try refreshing it
hi Vulpbrony
Shamroc: junky.
Black hole is best level
hmm ah well
Meanwhile SHH NOPONY MUST KNOW
I still remember every Starfox 64 level I played perfectly
I just realised I've been on Bronystate for a whole year.
I am too excited to care to refresh
pew pew pew!
Doesn't time fly.
/me claps for Meanwhile
Andross' brain creeped me out the first time i beat 64
Meanwhile: how does it feel?
I got an idea for a fan fic my friends
Meanwhile, ya veteran nao! tell us how it was back in the day!!!
Vulpbrony, do tell
Lambo: getting the perfect ending just felt good man, and when fox's dad shows up, just tears
wow...
MahBoi777: Like I've seen more films in the past year than I have in the rest of my life combined.
so we got Queen Crystalis
this channel is certainly spammy
lol
Firaga: Never managed to get all the alternative levels :(
Mutterguy: Lotto took a lot longer and the site was more rudimentary.
Wormhole!
she is pissed
YES
nope
nvm
SuperBrony64: This is the best level
strawberrie_smuckerz: I see no one trying to sell me viagra
Lambo: :O do it! emulate that shit if you have too
The Independence-Day level was awesome, with that big ass mothership. Or fighting against Wolf
THE AWESOME BLACK HOLE
So Queen Chrysalis is pissed...
Trippy
duuuuuuuude
Very trippy.
Wait, Chrysalis gets drunk!?
it sure is giygas in here
i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone~
I still can't believe that the whole Starfox crew amputated their legs...
and that isn't an invitation to start trying.
she researches Equestria
Mah boi, this acid is what all true warriors strive for.
Oh wait this isnt the level I was thinking of
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hi everypony
dat shortcut
and finds out there was One Before Celestia
Meanwhile: Lol, indeed
hi Kriel_Pony
Allo Kriel_Pony.
CupcakeWarrior, were you thinking of "When the Saints Go Marching In"?
Yep
the King of Chaos
Oh god, that was a loopy stage
fun fact, peppy is the only surviving member of the original starfox crew
07?
It sucked that Starfox 64 didn't have savegames. You had to play it all at once
I think it was called "Out of this Dimension"
Not replaying
03the one who has a baby
Acid? i thiough it was, crushing your enemies, having them driven before you and ...HEARING THE LAMENTATIONS OF THEIR WOMEN!!!
This game is a lot more fun with the theme from Power Rangers Turbo playing.
xD
Mutterguy: dat conan
07but what movie lol
Wait did SB just shortcut into the hard path?
so Queeny re awakens Discord
03the Spice Girls movie?
07ah
07right
Whoa, that's a complex idea
specifically Conan the musical
Funny to think that a regular Smartphone of today can play PSOne games already
ships bein attacked by metroids
to go after the one pony to secure victory
Celestia
07it's been ages so I don't remember all of it
SPAAAAAAAACE
03they have that friend who's pregnant
make her go crazy
5,4,3,2,1 Rangers in SPACE!
crazy enough to frighten the Ponies
03also LOL WHAT
BOOM
03is this a fourth-wall thing?
into a revolt
03they're discussing the movie during the movie?
I didnt know power rangers had a SPAAAAACE version
CupcakeWarrior: You clearly didn't watch much Power Rangers.
CupcakeWarrior: it was the best fucking season!
it's only a matter of time
Firaga: Mighty Morphing would like a few words with you.
Hi I'm new, do europeans gather on any spesific chatroom?
and heres a little fact I glossed over
Meanwhile: please, dat grand finale with zordon doing the thingy
welcome Shimmer!
She is USING Discord
they had soooo many versions. NZ only got the first one thanks to some idiot doing a kick into a pane of glass and ruining it for the rest of us...
Meanwhile: and bulk and skull just being awesome
Plus Mighty Morphing had the best theme.
Oh hey Shimmer, everyone has the same chatroom
PLUS.
Tommy.
Hello everypony :D
Your argument was never more invalid.
and hi shimmer
he really doesint know hes doing this
hey Resonantwaves!
Meanwhile: knows all the answers
i agree on the theme thing
Also, welcome to bronystate Shimmer!
11,02Next game >>
or does he?
LOL ragequit
hi Shimmer
NOOOOO
lol SuperBrony64....you sore loser ;p
Snake?
SNAAKE?
so thats the premise
TROLL
ded
Thanks everypony =)
/me pours Shimmer a mug of cider :)
my favorite 3 seasons are space, mighty morphin and RPM
Cheers!
>RPM
You are dead to me.
anypony got any feedback?
Meanwhile: have you even watch it?
I didnt think people actually watched power rangers
I tried to. It made my face ache.
I wonder whats the next game is
02!drftime
02[The current time where I live is 0302:30:4802 on 03Monday, 05/28/201202. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
CupcakeWarrior: some could say the same of MLP really
Arguably though, the last Power Rangers I ever watched with much enthusiasm was Dino Thunder. And that was only because Tommy was in it.
When I was a kid my favorite shows were Dexter, PPG and My Life As a Teenage Robot
Any bronies from Norway? :)
Turbo was pretty weak in my opinion
CupcakeWarrior: you sir are a man of class
after the glory that was zeo
Gold Ranger is best Zeo Ranger.
actually fuck rpm, zeo is my favorite
i wonder what game SB will summon now
night everypony im hitten the sleep sack for tonight
Night Shamroc.
I just wonder what Ganon's up to
gnigth Shamroc
Nite!
SuperBrony64: I think you should stream your voice
^
So let me get this straight. Queen Chrysalis, in anger from losing her recent battle, researches the history of Equestria and finds out there was "One before Celestia". She decides to reanimate Discord and use him in her plan to lead the ponies into revolt againt Celestia... or is it the other way around? That right, Vulp-- oh dang, he left
dat dk64
Donkey Kong 64!
Oh hey, DK64!
YES
DONKEY KONG!

I wonder if it is posible not to have played this game...
Ive never heard of DK on the 64
SB64...
SuperBrony64: O U
But I would rather watch some Banjo Kazooie
I agree, best looking SNES game ever
11,02CupcakeWarrior: D:
CupcakeWarrior: wut?
Ive played all 3 DKC games though
back when rare knew what the fuck it was doing
/me has to watch FF13 at some point
SuperBrony64, I prefer Super Mario Sunshine :3
I never had very many 64 games
For the SNES
he has no swag
That is just King Louie
Gimme some Pokemon Stadium
lol
If I recall, this game has over 200 Golden Banannas to collect
My favorite N64 game I had was Pokemon Stadium
11,02Polydunami: Dat a cool game too :3
Word CupcakeWarrior
DK Rap
CupcakeWarrior: But... how is your favourite game not Ocarina Of Time?
No matter now nestalgic, I will never like this rap -_-
mine was either kirby crystal shards or majoras mask
Lambo: I never had the game
I preferred Majora's Mask
Lambo: Majoras>ocarina
WHA-
Lambo: But I played the 3D version
I have both on VC
Oh hell
you could tell rare was just having a blast with this
Finally
Ded
Dang, Klump you a party pooper

I was 4 when this game came out
Double night Shamroc.
GOODNIGHT SHAMROC

CupcakeWarrior: you so young
Darf14: except lack of muscians
This ist just like Banjo Kazooie
Except Banjo Kazooie is better ;)
CupcakeWarrior: Man, now I feel old
Lambo: same developer
DK is best pony
Except with less banjos.
/me 13yawns and curls up by the fireplace
Night Shizuschlafen
SuperBrony64, you still have your Expansion Pak?
Rare was so great - and then they turned to shit
Night Shizu. Don't let the duck bite.

by the looks of the island he didnt beat the game yet
Tiny kong
eez so tiny!
This is basically DKC on the 64?
I need to play this again
oh...nevermind, he did beat the game
... But I have no N64 anymore :(
Wait, did this game have some giant dinosaur in a cage?
Yep
I never freed that thing
Rare games always had too much to collect
I have my N64 gams still
03LOL what, it's the end of the movie
Frantic factory ftw
SPICE UP YOUR LIFE!
Does she have bananas stuck to her head or is that actually her hair?
Dat attitude reminds me of somepony... Pinkie Kong!
03that story made absolutely no sense :P
when did rare got so wrong?
Pigtails, dude..
Meanwhile, Yeah
asisaid, it's a meh movie
Toy factory, I remember making a Yo Dawg joke in this place
zo hopefully you know a few more SG songs now, yes?
03sure
03most of them were meh
Pinkie kong or tiny pie?
03the one at the end wa alright
03*was
Dang, that was a neat game
I can't wait for Sony finally to release The Last Guardian for PS3. Then I will get me that console, finally...
Argh, nostalgia is infecting my olfactory system
what sorta songs do yu like?
upbeat ones?
CupcakeWarrior: That game was awesome
I also have Clay Fighter on the n64
He needs those drugs man.
Blueprintz
heh
I never got Pokemon Stadium. Module games were expensive back then
Beat up those brutes
03yes
Collect the blueprints
02he likes really sad music
figured
03No.
02:D
Try going to THAT arcade machine in the game
Oh god
I hate bananas.
Does Donkey Kong 64 also have underwater levels?
I played OOT once, but I was 6 and had no idea what to do
03Honestly sad/happy, doesn't matter, as long as it's got a beat
i still have my n64 games lying around somewhere
201 bananas in all
Whoa
yea
CupcakeWarrior: It took me 2 years to complete... the last fihgt against Ganon was damn hard
03the only music I can't stand is country, pretty much... and stuff involving screaming
WTB Pokemon MMO in the future, with the original 151 of course.
03screamo/whatever you call it
lol
CupcakeWarrior: i managed to get trough that game when i was 8
One time, I beat Ocarina of Time in three days
but you like rammstein/du haast?
02you like slow or fast music?
Umm... yeah :$
nice
cool
You mean, in 72 hours in a row?
also the water temple is really not that hard
I have never played any Legend of Zelda games.
03well
It wasnt to hard of a game, really
No, not like that
:O
03German always sounds like shouting
/me runs
03BlueFlare fast ideally
I just meant three days
Meanwhile: WHAT!?
King K.Rool laughs at ur quit
Apparently people have beaten OOT blindfolded 0_0
Polydunami: so you stoped the moon in time then?
Firaga, Ocarina of Time
BAWS
hmm mibbit lag is over 19000 ms
drf whydontu have pacemaker , crank up ALL tempos of ALL songs by 20% ;D
Polydunami: i know i was just joking
03XD
Polydunami: I think he was making a joke about the three days
Boss time
Mutterguy: that's way over nine thousand.
03I've done that
i herd you liek faaast
02how about F bomb song?

Whoa, you can do that?
03hm
03Naoko Mori as Nicola, the girls' best friend
If only Rare had made a proper Banjo Kazooie for the 360, instead of that nuts and bolts nonsense
do a barrel roll!
03doesn't mention if that's a real person or not
A BLIND PERSON BEAT OOT
Oh yeah, I remember that being accomplished
Lambo: feels bad man

Yes?

i never liked golden eye for the n64...
/me takes cover
:O
WAT
Lol that Kardboard K.Rool
That game is amazing
Firaga: I liked it back when I was a kid. I tried playing it again...
Firaga, how come?
This is one of the wierdest boss fights Ive seen
i really dont know why, since i really loved shooters like duke nukem 64
Agreed.
my arm!
Card Board Cutouts make the best boss fights
Speaking of wierd, I also have Earthworm Jim on the N64
Dat flail
Fail
but i just never got into it
Why is there some douche in a sheet wandering around the platfrom/.
00,10OMG http://screensnapr.com/v/2HffxM.jpg =p

The number Sumica. What do they mean? D:
what are the numbers mason?
02so drf lieks really slow sad country music with lots of swearing
03LOL
What do they mean?! :O
03OK see
03there's ONE recording
03that I find hilarious
Wait, I remember Duke Nukem 64
03have you heard the song Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg?
02yep
Crud, I immediately thought of the DOS version
Oh I remember that Duke Nukem game, it was in 3rd person
Darf14: duke nukem has ever been in 3rd person
The N64 controller...who thought of that design?
I think that was Zero Hour, Dark_Horst
Whoops
I meant Darf14
CupcakeWarrior: Aliens
Not that I recall
Firaga: , there was the platform games in the early 90's
03hold on, gotta find it
Your ass is grass, and I've got the weedwhacker.
Mutterguy: oh yeah those....
Oh yeah
We had the first one

Is this the final boss or something?
Its not over yet
From what I remember there were only robots to fight]
Its not the final boss
11,02:/
Derp
DOH!
ded
lol
Cupcakewarrior: nope, the final boss is much more challenging to get to
good try
because of that damned nintendo coin
Next game :)
Gief Pokemon Stadium
We also had Commander Keen
or was it the RARE coin?
Conker or banjo anything!
Correction, both the Nintendo coin and the RARE coin
King K.Rool is best Boss
http://cafewitteveen.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tumblr_m2oup2oyea1qardsjo1_500.png
and Comsom?
Tell me that doesn't explain everything.
Conker is obviously borderline NSWF
but funny
Not Safe Work For?
Oh yeah
YES
8captain Cosmos
I never Played Conker for obvious reasons
Hey Firaga
galdeeneye
you did this on purpose didnt you
because nostalgia
Goldeneye :)

DAH DAH daaah DAH DAH daah DAH DAH DAH
Everyone loves Bond.
POW
overrated crap

kinda like ponies
Out
Now
kk
those graphics are amazing!
Polydunami: so, who gave him the idea?
Dont feed him
True fact, responding in any way means you lose.
i dont like the game, but i can see why people love it
I don't give a damn
this has moar plot than pony butts
Ignored
dis gun b good
>.>
ugufurrylolitsthesam that all you got? :o
02XD
03isn't that great?
Stop feeding
I tihnk he is gone
03That guy's voice is just funny when he swears
He is gone
thats not trolling,this is trolling! ps3 has no gaems
lol silly troll
you beat it in 00 Agent? Man your good at this game
03but yeah, for the regular song I like the radio edit... in fact I actually obtained something quite rare, had to import it from Germany
^
Darf14: you're*
03the "no indo" radio version
DOH!
But Firaga even your nick is so anti that statement, too obvious
I really should read my typing before I hit enter
Shimmer: how come?
I always died on multiplayer :/
didn't they remake this game?
MahBoi777: yup
twice actually
ah
This game has the best pause creen music
for the wii, and for ps3/xbox
Her majesty's secret service.
I rarely die thanks to Odd Job :) <---- (GET HIM!!)
Firaga: cuz if I'm not wrong you took Firaga from Final Fantasy? :)
It's funny because by and large no one gives a damn about her majesty.
mah gun, it go a pew pew
dat pause music
Shimmer: funny because i dont have a ps3
wish i had tough
Oddjob's most memorable line: "Ah ah!"
^
Thats the tiny guy right?
yes
He wasn't tiny in Goldfinger
Ah, well Firaga is a spell that's in at least half the FF games :p
But he was mute
ITs always the quiet ones
I thought it was just fire 3
Ive "played" FFXIII before
so wich one of you was the guy that always picked oddjob because he was so hard to shoot?
Dat aim
Boom Headshot
I've seen FF13 played before
02didn't know there was a radio version
That was me, I picked him
"played"
03yeah
wow, guns open doors
Shimmer: yeah, in case you're wondering ff6 is my favorite
I could watch it right now...
MahBoi777: Guns do everything

Bye XAX
Guns dont kill people, bullets do
03it's completely re-recorded with different lyrics, not just censored :P
later XAX!
Bye Xax
03and I actually think it sounds better (not just because it's clean), it doesn't sound as old
Darf14: Yes. Bullet Cake.
I feel sorry for people who've only played FFXIII/FFXIII-2 and none of the preceding games
bye XAX
CupcakeWarrior: you are correct
I love 64-bit character models
I feel sorry for anyone who's played the FF franchise :P
02yeah
I've played all except for VIII and XI
( lol ol ol late ) Byes XAX.
Meanwhile: oh you
Meanwhile: Thats a little mean. I like the earlier ones.
I've never played FF
VII ftw
he's probably going to shoot rabbits or jbe on the computer
Well the only FF games I ever played were 1- 6 am I in the clear?
*just be
03but you'll see the chorus still has "smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice"
I like FF# (the nes one)
Darf14: yup
03the one I have removes that
I'm sure it's a matter of taste but I don't really do turn based combat.
FF3*
03it's played on the radio a lot, but I had to actually record it off the radio xD
03then I discovered a German CD single
ff7:cc was great
Darf14: 7,8, and 9 arent bad. Well, the story in 8...
Meanwhile: if you haven't played FF5-9, I suggest you try :)
hello everypony
Turn based is something meant for chess.
hey ponybro
Meanwhile: btw ff7:cc wasnt turn-based
And arguably RAin Slick Precipice of Darkness.
Meanwhile: and pokemon
I only play strategy rpgs nowadays
Oops
but chess is awesome!
Never cared much for any Pokemon beyond gold.
00,10Ah goold old tech support. You put in the discription that you have already tried the trouble shootig guides and include the nessacary info such as directX info and tracerout and you get the canned responce telling you to try those things.
CupcakeWarrior: I tend to prefer action RPGs actually. Currently playing Dragon's Dogma
twilight_sprinkler: Agreed. Chess is good fun.
I never played any of FF games above 7 is because I never owned a Sony Console .... ok there was FF 13 for Xbox but I didnt bother with it
Paper Mario was a good game for the N64
Umm
Did it die?
11,02Bored
Oh
ok
Sumica, abort try or cancel?
Apparently there is an FF14
Darf14: be glad you didn't, FF13 was a disappointment
SuperBored64.
11,02Last game
*retry
Sumica: I worked tech support for a few years. Honestly, they don't really teach you much.
/me exacutes a manual precusive reboot on Mutterguy
Yeah, FF14 was released too soon, apparently
Too soon Executus.
I heard that game was a mess
FF13 is the Final Fantasy MMO, and it blows...
14*
You would think they would announce FF15 by now
:V
i never liked the direction FF took after 7, i mean yeah the drama was quite high in 6 but it was well balanced
:V
Can they not just let FF die?
Probably at the next E3
/me dances back into chat
wonder how many FFs they're gonna make lol
I love FF12
/me hugs DeathStar
/me shines a disco ball at DeathStar.
wb DeathStar
Meanwhile: Why would they? People bitch about the last one and buy the next
Maybe up to FF CCDXXIV?
WII
seems legit
Kriel_Pony: I don't like undead franchises.
I would rather they just make Kingdom Hearts 3...
ooh Gamecube
I hope they'll make a FFVII remake before they quit the franchise, even though they said they won't :p
S'why I don't like anything Nintendo makes.
wait no
Ive never played KH
yay the Wii
Wii
is sb64 still streaming?
Meanwhile: most games are that today
DeathStar: yes
I didnt like the fact that donald and goofy were in it
thats a gamecube
Meanwhile: Series never die.
Indeed. And I hate most of them.
Darf14, is that 324?
CupcakeWarrior: Well it WAS a crossover
no sound = u=
Rhythm Feva!
Kriel_Pony: Rubbish.
i wish theyd remake evil genius. that game was so fun
MahBoi777: sb + wii = fo' sho'!!!
I was never really a fan of most disney stuff as a kid

derpy_pony: It's a non season now. :P of course it drops
Whats a ZXSpectrum?
this is not safe
between one and two there was a constant rise
Guys..
CupcakeWarrior a computer from the early 80's it waxs even cheaper than the C64
iSnt that Wii Resort on the water? O.o
but...the fanculture products were cooler back then
CupcakeWarrior and it had quite the grafical limitations XD
derpy_pony: The internet hype about MLP didn't really catch speed until most of season 1 was over I think
DoctorTimeyWimey: You decide what you play. D: Not us. That's the streamers choice. =3 As long as it's within the rules.
afkb
oh deary..
Ouch D:
it was 4chan only until february 2011
Donka donka
woot Lil_B ?
derpy_pony was the first season even over then?
Shimmer most people joined the herd during the Great Pony Drought of 2011 imo
no, it ended in may, iirc
Lil_B: How much data could the zx spectrum hold?
immm back
64kb?
CupcakeWarrior i have no idea, i don't know that much about it. But i known that some old computers couldn't hold any datea and everything had to be on Floppy discs
which is better marvel or DC
^flame source
Lil_B: there were no hard drives before the late 80s
Superbrony64: I liek your mii
derpy_pony: i remeber that C64 was using compact cassettes
not sure about other computers, tho
DoctorTimeyWimey: Can you do the pirate Game? :D
geeky-brony: boath have there good and bad points

DoctorTimeyWimey: Oh wait it's 2 players... D:

DoctorTimeyWimey: XD

The only good thing about Wii; the menu music. I can listen to it for hours
Yoshi's Story, the real sequal. :D
Yoshi's Story...wow...
Vordox: I liek Cirno
Wait.:Classic Controller? O.o
chirumiru
CupcakeWarrior: Figured XD
I'm sorry...I really disliked this game.
Good afternoon everypony
Why is that?
Yeah I saw :p
It could have been so much better than it turned out. Had it been a true sequel to Yoshi's Island with similar gameplay, I would have loved it.
I wish Nintendo would put out more Soundtrack CDs
Anyone remember http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2666/wtff.gif? :D
k
That noise is obnoxious
OtakuTom: HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE Yoshi Story!? D:
loz
I didnt really like this game either
Because just about everyone my age hates it. The sound in itself was beyond sickening.
What color? And who doesn't like this game. I'll change it if so many people dilskes it >:
Navy blue!
DoctorTimeyWimey: green!
DoctorTimeyWimey: Pink :3
hehe sorry.
the first i herd of yoish story
I've never played it
actually, Yoshy Story has a soundtrack CD, that got released in Europe
This use to be my favorite game when I was little.
I've played this game all the way through. I had a 100% completion file on it. I had the black and white Yoshis
I like the SNES too, but it's not a bad sequal, so lighten up guys. http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6899/meeeeee.png :3
IT'S SO COLOURFUL I'M GONNA DIIIIIE
During it's time, I heard nothing but bad things about this game.
Yoshi's Island was incredible, and I really think they dropped the ball on this one.
Wow, your reward is a black and white yoshi? THOSE ARENT EVEN COLORS
by Kazumi Totaka, who is one of the most important Nintendo Composers and the Voice of Many Characters, including yoshi himslef
Imo, all the sound in this game is really annoying
If anyone says this game is bad...I'll....I WILL... I WILL.!!!!! http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/3362/nabegonemad.gif
The menu/page transition music is the worst.
Mainly that it it was geared EXCLUSIVELY towards young children. I guess it really conflicted with the social norm of the time that demanded that every thing be dark and edgy.
Vordox: Its not bad, I just dont like it
At least it's keeping me awake by making me try to dig my brain out
http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/546375_344023338985033_318882981499069_867334_1797385963_n.jpg the cute has ben dupeld
Dem cookies.
Dat nom
yup
The music is a bit...decent at most. D: Which is sad.
Yoshi is so fruity
It's not even that it was geared towards young children that I didn't like. It's more that the game was made to be a sequel to Yoshi's Island, which was an incredible game, but this onejust did not deliver.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5008/
how do you guys do it in amarica its 4:00 am
Let me just finish this level and I'll change the game oka? (:
It's 2 am here (:

Evening again
Wb XAX
hello XAX
OtakuTom: that's fair.
Allo XAX.
hi XAX wb
And there's no clear indication of how to really get everything out of the game. While the goal is to get 30 fruits in each stage, the true way to do it is to get all 30 melons (the light green ones, not the watermelons) in each stage.
Epic XAX guy
:3
icwatudidthur
epic violin guy is better
/me noms XAX

geeky-brony: You..need to watch more voice actors. :p
someone do one for Tara
i know
IT DOESN'T FIT
I still love Totaka's work in Mario Paint...lol
Tara is like... 20 different characters
But he also did the Mario Land 2, worked in Link's Awakening and Mario Paint and i think he did the Wii music
Confound these ponies, they drive me to insomnia.
I've still got Mario Paint
:'(
Wacking flies with a mouse
I wish I still had my SNES mouse
OtakuTom I loove the Gnat Attack music XD
Bronyx135: you too? :D
i miss ed edd and eddy
That mini game was by far my favorite thing to do in Mario Paint :D
/me whistles Ed Edd and Eddy theme
/me then sings Pinkie and the Brain
As well as screw around with all the different letters on the title screen (one of the first instances you see of Totaka's Song, too)
awesome
Pssh. No one has Mario Paint. It was simply created by the Government to make it "Seem" as if you could make 8-bit songs. Just like the Rainforests and Eurasia.
But Hirokazu Tanaka also worked on Mario Paint, and in my Eyes he did almost more for Nintendo then Koji Kondo
you tube
:)
Just 8-Bit songs on mario Paint oô
Just: I can take a photo of it if you want proof :P
KIRBY!
Hard to believe that Totaka was also the voice of Yoshi.

I meant about the Robot thing.
did anyone listen to the Lauren Faust/Tara Strong/John deLancie interview?
Everyone HATED that voice of Slippy's with a seething passion, but I honestly never did.
no thanks
You know, this boss isnt that hard
I still remember reading an interview with Miyamoto in the player's guide to this game...he was talking about the development for Ocarina of Time, saying he wanted another year to work on it...that was 2 years before the game came out...lol
That no was so dull.
Slippy needs to sound more like Barry White
shimmer
oh baby, ya gotta help me
DO A BARREL ROLL
Slippy should be played by Arnold Swarzenegger.
I hear Nintendo fired the voice actress and replaced her with someone who sounded even worse. I never heard one word of complaint about the new voice.
Fahx! Help meh!!
no!
lol
no?
no!
wow it's been forever since I played this game.
good
I heard that the Japanese were also dissapointed that Slippy didn't ribbit enough.
Apparently some frogs are hermaphrodite as an effect of pesticides

ADMIRAL ACKBAR

LOLwut
Speaking of roms, that Road Blaster for SNES is finally out. It's been renamed Super Road Blaster.
Dring the Great Depression, Rabbits were outlaws in Tennesee, forcing many pet-owners to staple Rabbit Ears onto their Pet Mice.
doesn't chocolate make you more awake?
remirez use your c button to kill the meteros
the voices and sounds in the Star Fox 2 sound almost excactly like the one in Star Fox 64
awesome shimmer
I give up lol

DoctorTimeyWimey: Told ya. R-Type 3. XD

Slippy should sound like Gordon Freeman, then we would all be happy
well for an snes
hahaha i get it
lol, agreed, Live_Essence
Life_Essence I see wut you did thar
My mom would be happy if everyone sounded like they did in Starfox 1
Wait, how did we end up with Star Fox 64...or the Virtual Boy overall?

OtakuTom: You mean Parodious?
