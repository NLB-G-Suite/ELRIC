Too bad I'm not here next weekend :S
04You can get Assassin's Creed II now

04As well as it's two spin-offs
Or something

Me Gusta
04Personally, I can't wait til Assassin's Creed III
DAMN my chat derped gotta refrresh
3 looks like the best out of the series
red is gud
So what is showing now?
Nuttin much
/me never played assassins creed :S
04Appears to be nothing streaming
I've seen the game, never played it
THIS STREAM ARIA
That was what I meant
04It's a dead stream, ladies and germs...been a while since this happened
its a pretty good series
04Looks like BronyState is closed for right now
somepony should fix this
is there a way to save it?
04Of course
04Whenever a mod gets on
04Trust me
04You don't want to ask for ponies
04That will get you bad things
i know
we need to spam the mods
04NO
04Whoops
04*No
I've seen what happens lol
im kidding6_9
04Spamming mods is just as bad as spamming the chat or any other user
it was a joke
Ghosties: just a question u have to pay monthly or something to get the webpage open or does the .net domain lasts forever?
04We paid for the domain
0_0 me brother was interviewed in news
04For a year
its hard to convey sarcasm through text
Indeed
04It's fine, Jspang
[wklmeb]JRP2234: what for ?
Ghosties: sooooo that means there ould be a day when bronystate dies :S
04Of course
forever......
04BronyState's gonna die *eventually*
04Key word
04*Eventually*
That will be a sad day in brony history
04At some point in time
everything has to die eventually
Can i post a YT link now, while no one is streaming?
SirGanjalf: yep
Ghosties: Which corresponds to...the day after tommorow. (dundundun!):D
04But so long as everything stays gravy I'm hoping that won't happen for a long time
we all hope dat
sooo...a week?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJjJY5YpKRI everypony needs to watch this guy's stuff
04I don't think we've shown The Day AFter Tomorrow, actually
04*After
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=vLcvCH1h1qk -here ya go, then. Nothing to do with ponies, but...
Ghosties: Hmmm, cool, I might suggest that in the next lottery.
please don't show that film it on tv in the uk all the time
SirGanjalf: lol dat if diablo 3 were a girl recommended video
cachi01: Oh yeah, thats good too,
and true:'(
Revelations trailr hrhr
did you watch more than three seconds?
yah
sounds awsome
yeah
00,02it appears i was dinged
yes u were
i love assassins creed :)
he does that for tons of games and movies
Phase4: my brotherwas on channel 7
00,02[wklmeb]JRP2234, i have the tv on apc news 24
04I didn't call for the Phase signal
Australian channel 7?
00,02abc'
00,02Evil_Spike, yeah
Ghosties: It had been changed to the Batman symbol a while back.
colour goes off now
:)
Damn, was it to do with being a brony?
so, who's streaming?
Nopony
04Nobody, dead stream
dead stream is starting to smell
wait il...nvm
dead stream wuld be a cool game
there appears to be no stream
Ping me when stream restarts
04EVIL_SPIKE
cuz i had a request
Phase4: y u no use cool colour again?
/me slaps Evil_Spike around a bit with a large trout
cachi01, because i can :P
:D
Ghosties: That wasn't very nice..:<
04I don't care :D
xD
Or when somepony starts streaming again
/me slaps Ghosties around a bit with a large trout
fish in da face scout style Ghosties
i declare war
Ghosties's call to action: "Whatever the fuck I want, just get out of my way when I actually do it.":D
04Pretty much
lol
04I just like to fuck with people
I thought that was Dari's job to fuck around with others.
... I like to watch? O_o
04I don't try to intentionally troll
04Not bad, not like Val
Oh...
/me slaps everypony with a gummy
Val, oh my god, he is a good troll now.
I commend him for that.:)
04He's getting better
streamers y u no stream some omegle trolling!
Oh god
04He kinda set that standard for "If you demand ponies, you will get ponies...just not the ones you want"
04Because it didn't use to be that way
Hey cachi01, it's not we, but the other side that's the problem
As in, you could see something you don't WANT to see... you see?
i9ve been dieing for someone to stream a request
ive*
im sure the demand for constant ponies would have been getting old though
04But because so many people wouldn't stop demanding for ponies and not appreciating what streamers were streaming, that's when measures were taken
Polydunami: true..
I'll watch anything that's streaming, no complaints
^
<.<
>.>
but i just scream G3 OMG for fun xD
o rly
i think if there would be only ponys on teh stream it would get boring
why not just make a schedule if its such a problem
lol cachi01
if i dont like whats on the stream, i turn the stream off... i dont bitch about it, though sometimes i might joke about it
04And, you know, if you don't like what's on the stream at the time just go listen to some music, browse the web, or game for a bit until something else is on
and anounce it on your site
or click the popout button
Yeah, wasn't it Sumica who said, "This is Bronystate, not Ponystate"?
they have bmn and euro movie night
close that window
Is this really an issue for some people?
I dunno
and stay in the chat
i use chatzilla... it makes it easier for me to stay in the chat while i dont watch the stream...
04Maybe he did, but our mission is located right in the About Us - History tab
btw i has new upload http://youtu.be/27mNpP9VSQk
I love this site, glad mah friend showed it to me
Are these people complaining to the cable provider that the program sucks but they refuse to change the channel? :)
and my mission, that i choose to accept, is to go to bed and sleep...
hmmm, github does not like me
Ooh, new roundup post
good point Midnight_Tempest
Midnight_Tempest: mission failed?
I think I will take on that mission as well
[wklmeb]JRP2234: my ears are bleeeding
cachi01: mission will commence now... night all
Goodnight everypony and I will see you tomorrow ;)

Bronystate is a helluva drug
Bat Credit Card
04@Malevolent: Oh u
04We all know that's a lie
no its pie
mods are the dealers and bronystate is the best gear going around these days
04Though, if you do, I highly suggest that you get your life in order before returning to BronyState ^_^
Malavolent: o_o...I have been on this site for 126 hours now, straight, (Day 5) When will rescue come to pick me up?!
What is this life thou speak of?
TheRainbowDash: Well... you're doomed.
04That thing that you use to exist
TheRainbowDash: who would ask for rescue in such a wonderful place like this?
bronystate is a feeling! who needs a social life!
So life is equeal to internet?
BRONYSTATE IS MY PRECIOUS
https://github.com/ariscop/xchat-scripts/ yay~
TheRainbowDash: are you running low on supplies? lol

Ulthane, y u allways in here
cachi01: I have been here in this trench, no food, no water, and my ropes snapped already from a previous attempt to get out from yesterday.
:D
I already broken my left hoof, my flares died out, I got nothing left.
04Just you guys wait til I get the chance to stream. I probably would have done so sooner if my upload speed wasn't terrible
hey anybody, what was that one vid that had like 30 different youtube poops in one vid

Spell-of-Gaming: Winrar.

Spell-of-Gaming, how do you watch stream
04Oh fuck, where are you Spell-of-Gaming?
thats JUST enough for streams
faster than %50 of ph
04Phase, are you streaming?
Ghosties, nope
04Okay, so you're not going to stream?
i might, but you feel free
if i stream its just going to be me playing tf2 or something
04Nah, I don't have the tools required to stream
=_(\
i'll send them to you if you wnat
want;'
04And if I play games they'll be stuff like Yume Nikki, .flow, Silent Hill series
04Yume Nikki and .flow shouldn't be hard at all to stream
Ghosties: do silent hill i wanna see that game
04But Silent Hill is the one I'm concerned about
i wanna silent hill in stream :)
04If I do Silent Hill I'm only doing the first four games
04In fact, I think I only can do the first four
04Pretty sure I can get 1 through an emulator of some sort
I would love to see a mod stream Conker :P
now theres a game
hmmm
I AM THE GREAT MIGHTY POO
04Hah, that'll be the day

Hmm, bananas....
Why did I get kick? I'll I did was type lyrics for This Day Aria :'(

Phase4: We sang this song in our English class. You wouldn't believe, how much fun that was. You see, the first half of word "pyjamas" is almost like a word for female genitalia in our language.
Looks like MCM is turning into a disaster

Cypresswolf: I wish...my internet was acting up after all these months :(
Ponies47: Nothing much, just that CrazyCherry is mad at me for stealing his/her sandwich.:D
would be easier to say what you didnt miss, it was a crazy minute
TheRainbowDash: Thanks.... :|
so just to clarifly i'm not allowed to enter the lottery for 4 weeks TheRainbowDash
You're welcome.
TheRainbowDash: Her.
Dat poor sandwich
:(
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Irish_Pony: Round 2 next friday - I got to the equivalent of 9 shots straight whiskey
alexxm: Well, just that if you are picked from the lottery in those 4 weeks, your choice will be overlooked, and move on, so basically, to sum it up, pretty much, yes.
/me sneezes.

Ok I think I'm gonna hit the hay. I'll be back in probley about 4 hours or so (me no like sleep) GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY!

Hiya Sylandest!!!
|Discord|: too hard
Ninjazz|Tired: Is it bakeing?
|Discord|: it has to be the mane six
TheRainbowDash: yes, including shoveling piles of gravel for the driveway...joy...lol
|Discord|: ....Rainbow Dash, because she is freaking amazing.:)
Sylandest: Grow some broccoli!
Om: What we talking about again?...
CrazyCherry: howdy! How are you? :)
|Discord|, Twilight, because best pony.
|Discord|: one does not simply choose
Twi_Fi: but I don't like broccoli...
RainbowAsh: this is true
Sylandest: Great how about you?
Ninjazz|Tired: Uhhh, exercice?
Sylandest: :O
Bronysith|Pirate: I choose...I would like to meet discord.
Sylandest: I really don't understand why people buy 50 dollars a bag, or even a bit more, fror just gravel and rocks?
Probs the bot that does it is not here =P
CrazyCherry: sleepy and still a little sore from the day before, but otherwise alright, hehe
|Discord|: http://derpy.me/lPSe6
TheRainbowDash: Rock farmers have a right to make a living too!
TheRainbowDash: because it makes them feel like their driveway is better than the rest...*facehoofs* lol
Sylandest: :)
Twi_Fi: I'm not talking about rock farmers.:D
Om: I thought we were talking about computers.
Sylandest: Yeah, exactly...(laughing)
Ninjazz|Tired: We are using them.
huh wait what?
what's wrong?
Ninjazz|Tired:D
Bronysith|Pirate: Do what because a drunkie is free. You are drUuunk!
Bronysith|Pirate: That link is flipin awesome
You awakened the klaxa, tremble in fear
i knew someone was awake on here
|Discord|: ikr
CrazyCherry: you've actually been away a little while since I saw you last. whatcha been up to?
/me trembles at the feet of the great and powerful klaxa
Bronysith|Pirate: Mah gawd....... you are a pirate! :O
Om: I'm using a potato.
*bows*
howdy, Irish_Pony!
Twi_Fi: http://derpy.me/lPSe6
Ninjazz|Tired: Course yar.
Bronysith|Pirate: Time to post it on youtube.
Om: :P
klaxa: its about time you woke up :P
08,01so my mother is... not the best at food, sometimes
Sylandest: Did you enjoy GilDash's company ;)
08,01she grew up in a situation where food was scarce
Sylandest: I've been in here and playing games.
08,01in the slums of india
my question klaxa is above several messages... about iris
08,01so she holds it in almost religious regard
Irish_Pony: well, yesterday, she was nice enough to let me rest when I had exhausted myself from exersise, lol
08,01what she does is she buys tons of food that's reduced
Sylandest: You leave yourself too open, mate.
Bronysith|Pirate: Dooohoo jesus :D
Bronysith|Pirate: My jaw still drops from seing that drawing.
The person you want to talk to about iris is Kabaka anyway afaik
Sylandest: Are you a nimber now?
/me shrugs
CrazyCherry: well, I wanna do that! But i gotta do gardening...lol
08,01more than we can reasonably consume in the timeframe of its expiry
number*
oh, yeah no idea you should be able to /whois them to see if they are away, no?
TheRainbowDash: i can just spend hours lookiing at it
afaik?
Bronysith|Pirate what exatly is a pony oc
Bronysith|Pirate: Do you have the link in a normal format? Cause youtube does not except swf ending links
Sylandest: :D
Ninjazz|Tired: *blinks* what? *realization* oh...agh! XD
as far as i know
08,01so it either gets frozen, or forgotten about
oh ok
08,01except, it's never truly forgotten
Om: nimber?
never used afaik before... *shrugs*
see, if i do /whois MakerDusk
08,01it just sits in the fridge
|Discord|: wat?
08,01y'know, to fester
08,01but the worst thing
* [MakerDusk] is away (I'm not around right now, for assistance please try out our #help channel)
Bronysith|Pirate: I need the link for that Pirate thing that will work with youtube
that's the second line of the /whois output
08,01the worst thing is that no matter how gone off something is, she will never throw it out
Uh-oh..
08,01she *will* find a way to use it
it shows the /away message on like 4 of iris...
it shows:
08,01disguising it heavily with spices or whatever, to hide the fact that it was gone off
ew.
WHOIS: MakerDusk
realname
08,01i'll give you an example
Ninjazz|Tired: its not fair, I only just woke up! Shouldn't I get some sort of like...defense..or something?
channels
server
away
oper

|Discord|: http://derpy.me/KpuKN
idle
account
thats all of it
Sylandest: Nope, you get none.
Sylandest: Either run, hide, or embrace. I've done a little of all three.
08,01we had some cheese in the fridge. normal, good cheese. it was left to go stale, then mouldy
but it says what you need ;)
thanks
Om: but-but-but
Oh...
Thanks man
08,01by the time she got round to using it, and i shit you not here, it was *literally* grey
Sylandest: I'm in the same boat mang
but yeah i bet there should be a possibility to mark them as away on the userlist
is mouldy cheese edible?
Find an ipad app or deal with iris limitation :( Most web based clients are lacking in some area or another
i didnt know that would show in whois... besides, id have to /whois everyone if i wanted to know if theyre away or not
Ninjazz|Tired: I've ran, and I've hid...but embracing is still somewhat scary...lol
08,01so she made it into a cheese sauce
ImOkayWithThis did you buy it mouldy?
Sylandest: Aye... That it is...
08,01because apparently it was now "blue cheese"
08,01and perfectly fine to ea
TheRandomkid321: nope
08,01*eat
o_o...:O
i know theres some irc clients for ipad, but i didnt want to fork over 5.99 for limechat and others...
too expensive i think
ImOkayWithThis than no.
Ninjazz|Tired: granted, gil's best chance was yesterday when my defenses were down. but now im mostly recovered. *shrugs* her loss, lol
there are free ones i think
Sylandest: Too open.
Could anyone suggest soem good xbox 360 game's?
ohai again bronystate! :D
Hiho people.
Ninjazz|Tired: doh
Sylandest: I'll let it know.
valoreins: wasabi
Hello RankWinner
Om: what-wait!
08,01also, she thinks that putting something in the freezer makes it incapable of going off
Hello valoreins! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Sylandest: And that's why you only trust me. :) Not Om.
Hello valoreins
Hey valoreins!
Bronysith|Pirate: Nori?
Sylandest: I'm the sake here.
Ninjazz|Tired: I must make note of this...*draws note on hand*

TheRainbowDash: busy having, fun!
Ninjazz|Tired: would you kindly fill me in on what happened?
valoreins: Yay! Good to hear then!
08,01yesterday, i was treated to some breaded Camembert that had been in the freezer
08,01it tasted very bitter
ImOkayWithThis: Stay for a while... You'll enjoy the show.
typing is hard.
Yay for Australian news

Ninjazz|Tired: okie

Bronysith|Pirate nice pny oc
Sylandest: That's why I love coming on English Morning.
pony
that awkward moment when bronystate isn't to blame for your insomnia
Sylandest: Scratch that.
Ninjazz|Tired: oh?
Irish_Pony by your name I asshumed it would be somethin like that.
08,01TheRandomkid321: it's not that she's stupid, it's just that she's too stubborn to listen to anyone when they tell her anything, and she has some weird preconceptions
?
never seen any in the app store...
http://zeptotools.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/irchon-brings-totally-free-irc-chat-client-software-for-iphone/
08,01like that if you leave cheese to go off, it's not really gone off, it's just matured into blue cheese
not sure if that's still in the appstore
Sylandest: No wait... Unscratch that... Too tired to remember my own names for the sessions on chat.
also, http://myfirstipad.blogspot.de/2011/06/irc999-review-of-free-irc-client-for.html
08,01and... okay, those who know me will get a chuckle out of this next bit
Ninjazz|Tired: hehehe *unscratches*
08,01so there were two bees sat on the window
Alright everypony, got to use that bathroom now, be right back.:D
08,01not bumblebees, but honeybees
oh gawd not this joke
TheRainbowDash: Okay.
you can tell the first one is foreign... read the article he wrote
horrible english
08,01and she was convinced, and i mean *utterly* convinced that they were wasps
08,01and she wouldn't listen to me that they were bees
niced yifle1
yifle cool.
i once had a wasp nest in my roof
SHIP ALL THE jedi and sith with me
yay
08,01and not only this, she wanted to prove me wrong by trapping them in a jar and taking them to one of my fellow beekeepers
08,01despite the fact
08,01THAT I'M A FUCKING BEEKEEPER MYSELF
lol
/me 08,01fumes
Ninjazz|Tired: so what did you get up to while I was unconcious?
/me laughs so hard he cry
i might just end up buying one anyway...
Should I get borderlands? IS it any good?
thanks for the help though klaxa
and wake up! :D
no problem
08,01Twi_Fi: yup; that's why i tend to talk about bees a lot
TheRandomkid321: I've heard its fun
Sylandest: Lets see.... Ab... So... Lutely... Nothing.
tomorrow is my girlfriends birthday
where were y'all last night!
08,01inb4 not the bees
the b-movie was hilarious.
girlfriend
Ninjazz|Tired: You sure?
TheRandomkid321: its alright
TheRandomkid321: it's good, if not a bit repetitive
Ninjazz|Tired: I like that idea! If only I could apply it to today...XD
Seriously my throught feels like its being scratched.
Om: You sound like you know something that I should remember. :S
08,01but yes, that's the kind of stubborn i'm talking about
MadSurge REPATIVE!? UNNACEPTABLE!
08,01Twi_Fi: i can't draw.
you streaming?
08,01never been able to
08,01i'm not, no
Sylandest: Well... It can get boring sometimes.
oh... who is?
08,01i can start, if the stream's free
Ninjazz|Tired: Oh? Ah, no no. Your good.
08,01no idea
Im also looking at 3DS games
Ninjazz|Tired: well, thats why you come on here to hang with us and so we can give you something to do! :)
its a little repetitive, but then, what shooter isnt?
Om: Well, dude. I litterally can't remember or haven't done a single thing after the movies.
i can only draw stickmen :D
TheRandomkid321: repetitive as in "you shoot a lot of stuff and you have fun" :D
valoreins:
Ninjazz|Tired: I was sleepin.
Sylandest: Aye. Quite so infact.
yifle1: stickmen for the win!
I often try to draw, just to practice and get better, but I always end up disgusted with how terrible I am and quit.
well, off i go... just bought and installed limechat for ios
:D
brb
08,01Twi_Fi: i have a massive respect for people who can do things i'm shit at. this is why i find people who are good at art very sexy
Om: You didn' tell me. :|
:s
Ninjazz|Tired: You didn't ask.
i love to draw
MadSurge hmph. Okay. The art style looks good so I may try it.
i make comics
Om: I have to ask you?...
08,01Twi_Fi: i tried practicing, but i can't even draw stick figures
Ninjazz|Tired: I know when my day is over, I love coming on here, even if for just a short while, hehe. It's almost necessary now, without it, the day doesn't feel quite right
but the extent of my talent is stick ppl
and shapeless blobs
TheRandomkid321: the INSANE amount of weapons and upgrades outshine its repetitive aspects though
08,01i'll just stick with music
Ninjazz|Tired: What are we talking about ._.
but i'm ok with it
Sylandest: Same. Same. It's almost habit now.
my brother and I both make comics and read eachothers.
I fall into despair whenever I see Wrek doing art.
my sister keeps naggin me :D
08,01|Discord|: i... um, yes
PinkiePieFTW: thats cool
Twi_Fi: why despair? :O
Om: That I must ask you to tell me when you are going to bed so I can say good night to you... o_o
lolz tat awnser
Sylandest: Because I can't draw and I see how bad I am compared to Wrek.
TheRandomkid321: I'm getting Borderlands 2 when it comes out. Also, try to see if you can get the "game of the year" edition, it's got all DLC expansion! :)
Ninjazz|Tired: Is that what we were talking about? Oh, sure.
|Discord|: He actually thinks he's sexy.
Ninjazz|Tired: OH GOD
madSurge Ok.
I want to draw my oc but I can't.
08,01Ninjazz|Tired: indeed
Twi_Fi: dooo eeeeeeeet
Twi_Fi: then don't try to compare yourself if it makes you feel bad. Just relax and enjoy the art you get to see rather than let it make you feel bad. I can't draw either, but I enjoy seeing him draw anyway
MadSurge : Is that borderlands 1 your refering to ?
coyboy: yep
Sylandest: Oh I enjoy his art still. He's very good after all.
Borderlands GOTY on sale at EB games for 25. Nice.
klaxa: i really like limechat
best 4.99 i ever spent
Borderlands 2 is gonna be amazing
Twi_Fi: then you've nothing to worry for or feel bad about, hehe :)
If they're gonna show the drawin' thing again, I wanna see pinkie pie.
Om: So anyways, tell me when you heading out, man. I gotta say Cya's and what nots.
okay, psst, not the right channel to talk about that ;)
EVen thought you just got here.
StupidSexyCJ: I agree :$
What about Banjo Kazooie. Nuts and bolts?
kthxbye:)
cya ninjazz
oh wait...
yifle1: I do use that, I have three different ocs right now.
/me hugs PinkiePieFTW
didn't read the whole comment ^__^;
Oh, back.
Ninjazz|Tired: Arhkay, not really my thing to announce when I come and leave all the time. But I suppose I can.
:P
ok
oh well
welcome back, TheRainbowDash
just keep that for when you do leave
/me yawns
sleepy, CrazyCherry?
or bored/
Madsurge : Yeah it's a really good game only thing I would recomend is to find freinds you know to play with online otherwise you will be stuck with players who are higher levels then you are
Sylandest: No, its hungry. Hence the yawn
Sylandest: Yes...
CrazyCherry's text yawn made me yawn for realz
/me hugs CrazyCherry
aha. it all makes sense now.
Sorcery
Om: You don't gotta announce everything single thing you do *looks at TheRainbowDash* but saying Gnight is a good way of letting us know when to see you off.
yifle1: But you can do so much more if one is able to draw.
Om: but CrazyCherry says she is sleepy?
CrazyCherry: *offers blanket*
yifle1: But at least it's something.
Sylandest: My mistake.
/me hugs ImOkayWithThis back.
Twi_Fi: practice makes perfect my friend
Twi_Fi pardon?
/me takes Sylandest's blanket.
yifle1: Sorry, about the pony creator compared to actually drawing an OC.
its okay
i wish i could put was in my brain on paper...
Ninjazz|Tired: Mmmkay. Feel too much like ego strokeing to be all I AM HErE, Look at my hereness!
CrazyCherry: you tuck yourself in and relax. :)
/me tuck herself in.
i can´t be angry on somepony :) Twi_Fi
CrazyCherry: :D hehe
CrazyCherry: did you brush your teeth yet?
Om: I know that feel and honestly I know what you mean. But for some people's sake it let's them know your done for the night.
Ninjazz|Tired: mmkay
ImOkayWithThis: I'm not going to sleep...
CrazyCherry: But you in bed. :S
/me gives cherry a kiss goodnight
Ninjazz|Tired: I merely tucked her in a blanket. one can be in a blanket and not sleep, lol
Like I am right now.
Sylandest: She tucked herself in. :S
CrazyCherry: Where are you sleeping again?
00,02http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/05/paralyzed-woman-controls-robotic-arm-sips-coffee/ inb4 cyborgs
Who is streaming btw?
Om: Laptops for the win.
Ninjazz|Tired: oh, quite right. I did offer the blanket though
TheRainbowDash: On the couch right now.
okay then CrazyCherry remember to brush your teeth when youre going to sleep
so tired zzzzz
it was only a matter of time...
/me wants to be a cyborg
CrazyCherry: I'll join you then...
Ninjazz|Tired: Indeed.
/me bonks TheRainbowDash
:(
Ow! My head!
>:3
Twi_Fi: neh? what is it?
Ninjazz|Tired: now what made you go and do that? lol
Sylandest: My question went unanswered...
08,01so a friend of mine just asked me for advice on the making of moth-themed knitwear. here's the response i gave him:
Sylandest: She needed to be reminded that she is in public pony areas.
moth-themed...
Ninjazz|Tired: you are this close to being sent to the naughty corner
Twi_Fi: oh, right. Well...I'm not quite sure myself, actually :$
Mothra is best moth
08,01"That would be really cool! Moths you may want to look into: Atlas moths, Cecropia moths, Comet moths, Luna moths, Isis moths, Polyphemus moths, Brahmin moths, Madagascan Sunset moths, Elephant hawkmoths, Oleander hawkmoths, Cabbagetree Emperor moths, Spanish Moon moths, Hercules moths, and White Witch moths. This is just off the top of my head, so there are probably some nice ones I've missed out."
Dat wall of moth
dat wall
08,01and suddenly, i realised how much of a moth nerd i am
hahaha!
:D
moths ftw!
omg i just finished readin My Little Dashie , It was so sad.
Ninjazz|Tired: duly noted, lol. this is the public pony place

Hey there
/me 00,02hugs sammiver
Hiya Im_a_Scatmare!!!
I was going to ask this question to Wrek, but I guess I can ask everypony, when learning to draw do you need to learn any special steps or is it just best to draw and experiment?
Umm, hello there heythere! (waves and hugs)
Irish_Pony: You ignored me last night. :|
Hiya heythere!!!
dues ex i see
You guys never heard of Im A Scat man! *cue song*
hiya CrazyCherry!

GilDash and Irish_Pony: o_o, what were you two doing exactly last night?
Twi_Fi: i think its a bit of both, depends ont he style you're trying to do i would think

GilDash: I lost connection to my internet i swear! :'(
Hiya dishwasher_EXTREME!!!
/me hugs sammiver
my day has been going well, how about you guys?
08,01bee shoop de wabap
Twi_Fi: a little of both, learning to structure is good, but experimenting helps you find ways that work for you
Ninjazz|Tired: Stop it. Scat means something entirely different to me and.... Disturbed! Listen to more Disturbed!
Twi_Fi: if you're confused about how somethign is done, suggest watching someone else draw something similar and tryign to learn how they do it from that
/me puts Ninjazz|Tired in the cool chair

Gah, silly mother. took the plastic wallet all my drawings were in

Yeah, I was just curious because I sometimes see drawings started off with geometic shapes which are slowly shaped into the form desired.
GilDash: No, what event were you two doing anyway?
GilDash: IM SORRY! :'( :'(:'(!!!
Ninjazz|Tired: Yeah, it doesn't ever mean music to me. I'm not fond of it. At all. :D
GilDash: Hulahoops?

GilDash: :P

/me drinks a bottle of cider in front of ImOkayWithThis. "Want one?" ;)
StupidSexyCJ: O_O
alexxm: Gildy won't drink my cider that i made
I just stumbled over the word "smerious" and the urban dictionary entry about it is a bit lacking. As there should be a few native english speakers here, I'd like to know the exact implications of this term.
Irish_Pony: Oi! :D
GilDash|HulaHoop: thats applejuice
i will TheRainbowDash its also easier as i don't have to stay up until at least 4 in the morning
Hmmmm...Cider with whiskey....huh....
When I found the thread in /arch/, I was like waaaaa-. I didn't even remembered it existed.
Ingwaz: but yeah, about drawing, I guess I should start off somewhere, like using shapes, instead of thinking I can immediately draw the thing I have in mind.
alexxm: Oh, cool then.
ImOkayWithThis: ... You're impossible. :D
i'll have it ImOkayWithThis
/me likes CCCP because his chat name is easier to type

TheRainbowDash: I know. :D
/me smacks GilDash|HulaHoop with a pillow.
StupidSexyCJ: You don't need to type the whole name of somepony you want to talk to.
/me downs ImOkayWithThis's cider
CrazyCherry|Hulahoop: It is pillow fight again?
what is the movie tonite
ok, maybe it's something regional or a sociolect
GilDash|HulaHoop: I have just tasted...the greatest whiskey...i have ever made....
/me flings pillow at CrazyCherry|Hulahoop.
derpy_pony: Even native speakers aren't familiar with most slang on UD. Many of the entries are very localized or made-up inside-jokes.
StupidSexyCJ: Instead start typing a few letters of the name and hit tab until the desired name appears.
TheRainbowDash: Yes.
Irish_Pony: Oh goddesses, you want me to try don't you. :D
Twi_FI: dat helpful hint
Oh, awesome then CrazyCherry|Hulahoop! (gets my pillow guns)

Epic trailer, but it kind of oversells the epicness.
I fear that's only a very well fan-made Trailer
Oh my god epicness

this was what I expected after episode 1. one episode later the villain was defeated and all was over
i saw a c
MLP-FiM the Movie!
yay
Meh, this trailer's got nothing on the show itself.
they...will save the bronies to? that would make a good movie
Frienschips
To think. Lauren Faust wanted this to be something like this, too.
If any non-brony looks at this and isn't at least intrigued, they truly have no soul. :)
10hee
By our powers combined
is ninjazz asleep?
GilDash: Or they don't like cartoons.
I'm still wondering if they'll make an actual movie. Season 3 has recurring villains, AND John de Lancie was one of those who confirmed season 3. RETURN OF DISQORD?
GilDash, didn't see you there :D
this...will play at the end of the world
Om: Irrelevant. :D
MadSurge: Holla! :)
When december comes along...
GilDash: problem is, if any non-brony sees this first and checks out MLP afterwards, they will have no chance to ever become a brony.
Holy fuck, that was possibly the most epic trailer that I've seen, and will ever see in my lifetime. I commend it for of highest awards. I'll gladly pay to see this movie, and enjoy it such. What a trailer. (10/10):)
Villains don't return, cause that would be odd
xD
yay
now what?
Whats the name of this trailer?
This is more epic than the series itself.
how come Kandarihu
