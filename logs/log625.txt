Likewise.
Dolph Ziggler reference

Luna?
Look at her
LUNA???
Ow.
LUNA!???????????
She's staying in the castle
Luna needs no megaphone!
/me chomps on LunaTheBeloved's ankle.
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S LUNA!===
...I haven't realised it...
Ow!
/me cries out in pain
Just noticed.
CAMERA MAN, FOCUS ON LUNA
You fucked up Rarity
Then fixed it.
CAMERA COLT>*
/me breaks one of Meanwhile's toes
Riiight
dat grin
http://imgur.com/a/1dUjS#0
...Did you hear that noise? ...That was my jaw dropping to the floor...
FFFFFF.
This lie was never proven wrong
...Because of Luna...
You're digging a hole rarity
Rainbow Dash is still famous
And her lyes never bite her in the flank
/me bangs LunaTheBeloved's knee on the floor.
oh Celestia this episode
DAT SNOOTY LAUGH.
NO SCREEN TIME FOR LUNA? REALLY!?
AHUAHHUH
Tf2 players in a nutshell
Lol!
I SAY F you snooty people !
WHY WOULD ONE PONY MATTER
i really dont like that girls voice.
WOUNDAHFUULL
We need a Rarity and Luna episode! Have ALL the Tabitha! :D
08,01SOOONG!
SOOOOOOONG
YES
One of the MANY reasons Rarity is my least favorite character
<3
Great one as well
monorail
Although she has good songs.
ooo rarity song
Aaaand song.
I REFERENCED THIS SONG <---------------------------
Song time Kiddies!
Rarity really lets her "fame" get to her head
Highlighting everything that's wrong with Rarity in 22 minutes
I missed it
Rarity ;) <3 <3 <3 <3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: a
a?
Hey guys
literal version is best version
Mare do well is why I hate Rainbow Dash
that the asswoopings be handed out.
stfu
Also: OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
11,01Came back during the song.
I see Derpy!
/me breaks several of Meanwhile's toes
DERPY
I mean in the title
o_O
She comes home drunk.
"Random Merch: a"
Derpy?
o_o
damn, i missed her
Omg Opal cared for 2 seconds
I guess, lol.
mind=blown
a.
/me snaps LunaTheBeloved's leg over his knee.
Bullshit.
..............
Yeah, I see Derpy, I think um...third collum...third row?
I hate Twilight because of About time
I don't know...
I don't hate any of the ponies, IMO. At least they learn from their mistakes.
I hate Pinkie Pie because of friend in deed
Friends birthday
just to say character centric episode SHOWS their fault
/me lets out a blood chilling shriek of pure pain and agony as she falls onto the floor
that happens quite often in the fic updates
damn it, Rarity, does the title of this show of no meaning anymore...
Really rarity...
REALLY
Plus, the fact that they give in negative issues makes them emotionally stronger.
RRRGH
*give in to*
Opal gives zero fucks
Oh yeah
le gasp
We do have children.
Have you guys listen to a word I said?
Opal doesn't give a shit.
My crotch is tastey
That's disgusting, Opal.:S
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
BREAK MY 4TH WALL, PINKIE
SMOOTH MOVE RARITY
but nopony as a least rank
thats the common cat reaction to everything
Balloons are the greatest travel accessories
...
To be honest, you can't hate any of the ponies, just the mistakes they make.
How do you store balloons in a case?
PREPARE for incoming meme
/me stands up slowly as she pulls out a bonesaw
SEEMS LEGIT
Not in front of the children, guys!
Poor Opal.
no no no'
/me slowly begins chaining through Meanwhile's leg
uh oh
not poor Opal
she's a bitch
xD
also, gonna have to wait for TF2
she's a non-sapient cat
opal has mascara
Right lets go with that!
okay back off to TF2
that dress looks ugly to me tbh..
To be fair, Opal and Rarity seem to have a vitriolic best buds kind of thing going on.
that dress if awful.
Seems legit

11,02Night all ^_^
11,02It finished already :<
anyway, take care.
11,02It was garbage.
11,02They announced a bunch of Japan titles that would either never get released in the US or would take at least two years and finally talked about games we knew about already.
That's bull
You mean the fifth one I knew about already?
Awwwwwwwwwwww.....
wait
Oh
I
kinda knew about that one too
kinda neat to know it's on its way
11,02How? They /just/ announced it.
I saw how the creator had a sixth planned long ago
we'll have to wait 3 years for it to reach NA anyway.
when the fifth was announced for Japan
11,02Either way, it was officially announced today.
neato
but was MH4 in that list of japan games that won't be here?
I don't mind that
11,02Don't know.
11,02Yeah
and you're american

Saturn, debian really wants to handle its own grub.cfg doesnt it
everything after the movie
good thing I don't go to 4chan... or any site that ends with chan
Most distros hate you messing with grub.
It's annoying.
i don't know i never really watched spongebob
Personally, i guess Atlantis Squarepantis is the worst of all time
TWILIGHT THEME!!!!
That is the worst episode IMO.

Fighting games isn't my thing, and adding "girls for the sake of sales" just makes it totally uninteresting
I mean, I dont want to RE-BUY it is no one here is going to play it. thats why I ask.
But there is a channel apparently. I'd watch it
