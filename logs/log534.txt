SAMMICH
Sandwhich.
That's why horse owners make sure to keep the feed hidden, lest the horses eat until their stomach's explode.
Super sammich

XXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDD
AJ

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Frankly, I think a great way to troll people who ask for ponies would be to stream videos of REAL ponies. As in pony rides.
RAWRity: are we saying like a horse literally spontaniously exploding?
MLP?
dude
LSD
The problem is Spyro has had a downgrade now due to all the toys with the game
Party With Pinkie
/me laughs his flank off
did they really show MLP on this?
I know I am.
i for one welcome our pony overlords
Dem moves
I demand ponies
But not to collectors
PaladinDrakkenwolf: no, like their stomach breaking open and them dying from internal bleeding.
so horses are like birds?
>.>
NO
There is a HUGE market for spyro collecting right now
wish i had moves like these
Baliwood Cat?
RAWRity: oh... well that paints a gruesome picture
O.o?????????
oh sh*t C:
dafuq
i just love Party With Pinkie Pie VIP remix of Alex S
Kandarihu: Were you here when Nitt streamed something JUST like that?
Dken2021: Birds don't eat themselves. That's them eating uncooked rice making them explode.
RAWRity: okay these guys can move better than jagger
dB
Dance like that daily, get exercise
Er, Baliwood Nyancat
i know, skylanders is making a rediculous amount of money
This is how i would start every day

SHES EVEN MORE FUCKED UP THAN THE LAST PLAY
ALLLLLL THE BUTTHURT
i already have all the console games haha
your hat blocks it
This is a G4 btw so stop.
their legs are more broken because they're designed in flash. See?
THIS is even worse! LOL
The best night EVER!!
much better Sumica
Also, Applejack hat
Its just that if you plan to start getting the ones that are boxed and the collectors edition one youd have to pay a lot more
nice
graaaand galloping galla
Of all the worst possible things this is THE WORST POSSIBLE THING!
:S
yeah, that isnt really a huge deal for me
NO
I've seen worse
/me vomits

Hey Twilight? Your butt and hind legs seem to be a bit....broken. Might wanna see a doctor, hun
nope.avi
Om: I am below Rarity, truefax. I've been saying since ever. She is my queen and I bow to her hoof. As do we all.
well a 2nd time watching this wont hurt T_T

thank you for pointing that out
Team Twilight vs Team Rarity
lol Sumi xD
LOL back legs
Teams of three, don't eat me
I have no mouth and no eyelids, and I must scream
I don't know why, but I tried playing that lame G3 Piniie Pie game on the DS just to see how lame it was. All it was Pinkie walking around Ponyville and you just collected presents by clicking on them and doing lame minigames with no skill
SHe's inviting ALL OF PONYVILLE? Whoa, that is going to crowd the Palace.
I wonder if he trolls the stream like this only on fridays.
Team Chrysalis
Teams of four, whine some more
the back legs just drag on the ground
RainBowJack: you forgot Team Rainbowdash
Dat Trollmica
xD
Ok I've seen this TWICE as well. I LIVED! If I can you can! :[
at least the others were able to blink
Ninjazz|Fics: I heard. Many times
nice haha
Om: ^_^
Sumica: Inorite. The G4 stage models are shit. The G3 ones were way better.
Team Pinkie!

TEAM FLUTTERSHY

Mods will troll on the stream whenever users start getting uppity.
Team Sandvich
APPLEJACK AND RAINBOW DASH
Team Nappa
NAILED IT
Team BLU!
:)
Ninjazz|Fics: I agree with his opinion.
Ninjazz: It would be opinion, except that they really are shit.
badum tish?
TEAM PYRO
WOOOOOOO AJ AND RD!
WOOOOOOO
I wonder if you could do a proper G4 game though. Maybe make it a minigame collection? Or maybe an RPG. Then again they're not that many enemy groups aside from the Changelings to use
Two of my cousins were there. Jessica, 16 years old, was with her sister Annabelle, 7 years old. Annabelle was enjoying it while Jessica tried her best not to cry her heart out
CK|Basara: I get the idea that this stage show was an afterthought-- Hasbro did NOTT expectFiM to take off like it did.
I know. ^_^

WHY NO HAT
CK|Basara: Touche, my friend. Touche. /)
she's gonna buck with those legs. It'll be a famine.
LOL
AttackWithHugs: (\

dat line
Ghost30k the chick at the beginning took it
Silly AJ y u trying to cater to children?
Maybe they couldn't keep it on the head of the costume?
I can almost imagine a G4 Live Show that might be Brony friendly. First it would have to be based on the production values of the G3 stage show, but updated for G4. Have the cartoon's writers and voice actors working on it.
Pretty sure you already said that in the show

The Grrrrrrrrrrrrand Galloping Gala!
And now a wonderbolts reference

So they're just copying lines from the show.
Sylandest, look its AJ!
evening, everypony! :) How are we tonight?
That's pretty lazy.
yeah, pretty much
not sure who'd be the most traumatised, the children, or their parents
Sylandest, look its AJ!!!!
my cousin was there. She said it was the worst play she had ever seen. Ever.
Gunny: yes, I see her, hehe :)
Sylandest: We're diong fine.
Aaaand wonderbolts
i whould laugh if her legs fell into the audience XD
sonicrainboomer259|b: At one point the guy does show the crowd
they spent as much on the script as they did on the scenery and the costumes, and hell, the cast.
The Mane 3.
Sylandest: TERRIBLE WE HAVE TO WATCH THIS
AttackWithHugs: FLASH, the animation prgram used to animate MLP:FiM, is noted for high consistency in character designs-- and the Hub did something rarely done in a FLASH show, put a decent amount of cash into production. However, it's easy to make an animation mistake in Flash too.
=.=
/me join #DashieSauce
If you didn't want to make the excuse that RD couldn't fly why didn't they just make Rairty or Pinkie costumes instead?

AttackWithHugs: Sell it on Ebay LOL
No srsly, look at their snouts.
Sylandest: Joining Dashie sauce I see.
Kencolt: True, especially since Flash is temperamental at times...
No WAY could they pull off a Live Action Pinkie Pie. Not without passing out drugs to the kiddies.
They look....weird

Funny thing is. This was in Canada. :p

I am nuts
Im gonna be sooo sad when S3 is done and G4 is over :(
dat Sumica dancin
00,10love this part
a simple extended version of the intro would do really
Realsicically, if there IS a G4 movie, it'll be released after Season 3 , after Hasbro has it's Magic 65 episodes.
00,10Speed metal parasprite

in my headcannon, this song should be Friday Polka

If the G4 movie looked like The Secret of Kells, I'd watch it
My favorite is Rainbow's part at the Gala
DAT RARITY.
win
God, I love this fandom
Winter wrap up
BEST FANDOM EVER
00,10So many peole who dont know what cyndication is about.
Hasbro is going to milk FiM for as long as they can I don't think they will end it after s3
Nope
yes
/me waves air guitar to this song
sonicrainboomer259|b: Well due to the fact that S3 is only coming with 13 episodes, either their out of ideas, money, or both
Or they'll do a G5 and try to copy it
/me is singing
00,10also Cyndication dosent apply to cable channles.
/me sings Dr. Whooves and Derpy's part in the song
:T
G5 would'nt be the same
ummm Sumica, do you mean Syndication?
no matter how close it gets to this
I know what Cyndaquil is but not cyndication
Cmc
Spriggals: that means bronies could have a huge part in keeping FiM alive. EVERYPONY BUY LOTS OF TOYS
00,10you know what i meen
Back :)
Ghost30k: says who? It could probably be better than G4
Friend ship isn't magic. Go away Twilight no one even likes you. Not even Spike? DEFINTLY not spike... Why dosen't anyone like me? I like you. Princess Celestia, Is that you? Of course I like you Twilight HA HA LIKE YOU HA! HA HA LIKE YOU OOOO. Look! I'm spike now! /me Throws Up Rainbows
Yes.
Spriggals: Well, the Magic 65--meaning 65 episodes-- is themagic number for syndication... allowing a local station to show 5 eps wekdays, 13 weeks-- so four repeats over a year. It's kind of the way the beancounters tend to think.
Ghost30k: there will be more ponies after S3.i know to be true....
Ghost30k How do you know Season 3 is coming with 13 episodes?
00,10and for the record the 13 eps confermed are not even being made by studio B, dont you find it odd?
Who likes Friendship isn't real

SUMICA!!!!!!!
Make sure to watch Party.mov
suniOK, that I had not heard. Source?
It's hard to stay up, Red keeps falling asleep. :U
Sumica: WHAT!?
but now, you have the internet and bad publicity existing
Sumica: Very odd. I hope these other 13 are good
Sumica: So this is bad, I'm guessing?
sonicrainboomer259|b: well if they end G4 and start a 5th generation, they'll need to blow our minds and make us all have Ponygasms to keep their GIGANTIC FANBASE
The faith around here is amazing...
From falling apart
00,10more then likly they are having two studios make 13 eps each
00,10for a totaly of 26
SONIC RAIN-BOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Sanae.
Sumica that's what I've heard they're doing
LA LA LA LA LA
Mew
hope soooo
........... Show off.
Eiuouiouioy7: havin fun there?
The desktop pony is dancing
00,10by spliting the work they can increase production speed
00,10as in more eps in less time
Ghost30k, you know what I think they'll do?
Sumica: that could be true but its been confirmed theres 13 episodes give or take
Sumica: Let's hope they are as good as Studio B with two studios working together.
Ghost30k: That we know of
Which would mean that Studio B may also be working on a new project,possibly also Hasbro related. Battleship the Animation, anyone?
Sumica and higher quality episodes, too
They'll just keep doing what they intended, catering to the young audience
Turn soft music into ROCK. CHECK!
Sumica: wouldn't quality take a hit that way?
00,10but unlike the new firm studio B knows to keep things under wraps
CrimsonPhoenix: That's for Hasbro & Faust to decide
as if they could get better, I mean really
Sumica, or take their time and give us better quality episodes in the same amount of time
Ghost30k, remove Faust
Fluttershy stop yaying
well,there WILL be a S4,if not...so help me......
it's to Hasbro alone
and they WILL do like they always do
I found mordecai
cater to young girls
CrimsonPhoenix: She was the developer of this?
Faust was only up for the show of G4
that's it
not the toy brand but the show
alone
and she left
HERE WE GO EVErypONY
best part coming up
Wb.
MEW
:3
This almost sounds like an official soundtrack
this is the BEST PART RIGHT HERE!
as I was saying Faust has no decision whatsoever about the MLP brand
/me is rocking out
Sumica How do you know S3 is coming with 13 eps? Link, or explanation, please
w00t Dash solo!
sup everpony?
Twilight Sparkle:I can't believe we're finally here.With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this...The Best Night Ever!At the gala!Fluttershy:At the gala, in the garden,I'm going to see them all!All the creatures, I'll befriend them at the gala~Choir: At the gala!Fluttershy:All the birdies and the crittersThey will love me, big and small.We'll become good friends forever,Right here at the GalaChoir:A

O_O dat wall
SO MUCH TEXT WALL 6_9
sup eveypony?
Besides its 13 episodes we KNOW ABOUT we have no idea if there is going to be more
hi THEjackedbrony
And I think he actually typed out the entire song...
hi THEjackedbrony
DAT TWILIGHT
All that work, gone.
Dark92Enigma 13 episodes will be developed by Studio B, and 13 more by some other company I can't seem to remember
CrimsonPhoenix: The brand no, but she's still a consultant on the show-- and the Hub knows better than to dumb things down for a S4. They know where their bread is butterd-- and that bread is often next a beer.
......
00,10It was leaked some time ago. there was a post on EQD about it. the new studio had it on their page about what shows they were working on and how many eps they were doing.
so i did something awesome today
Ninjazz: I actually did
Ninjazz: now i feel sorry for him
/me pats Eiuouiouioy7 on the back
they might milk us out with G4
00,10keep in mind the studio B working on 13 as well is just speculation
Dark92Enigma but it's just a rumour
Eiuouiouioy7: Unless you copy pasta'd.
I went to texas steak house today for the first time
Ninjazz: Nope
14hello
Sumica: will it be same animation?or will it be changed due to different company?
Lunar_Brony Oh so there will be 26 episodes, like it should be..........Oh---it's a rumour
speaking of studio b aka dhx media...
mmm… texas
00,10I would bet it's the same.
it is now my fav resturaunt
im checking DHX media page right now, can anyone tell me what this means:"Format: 65 x H/H"? it's in mlp description
/me air guitars this last part
Maybe the studio will leave Hasbro and become a webseries post new episodes on Itunes & Youtube, making money and keeping us entertained
00,10it's all done in flash so they just hand off the software
but when it'll come to G5 they most likely will ignore bronies and focus on the young girls like they always have done
Ninjazz: that would have been a royal wall.
yeah it is my last meal with my family before bootcamp
Dark92Enigma the internet's full of them
*posting
Oh, thyey'd be INSANE to change the basic animation at THIS point.
.....................................
Pinkies4thWall: Good thing there are limits to text walls.
00,10and it's just the animation, they will still have the same cast and crew andsuch
i know
Ghost30k, that would be copyright infrigement
CrimsonPheonix LET'S HOPE THAT WILL NEVER------EVER HAPPEN A-GAIN
what I miss?
CrimsonPhoenix: let's hope the fuck not!!!
CrimsonPhoenix: true
I only have 4 days till airforce bootcamp
if they lose the contract and decide to continue the series they WILL get sued
great
Lunar_Brony Damn Internet, you scary
Pfffff
But Airforce bootcamp is in Texas
CrimsonPhoenix: Somehow I don't see that as happening-- ot quite. They KNOW what is good for them. And mostly it's us.
Sumica
YESH

HORSE MD FTW
I woke up too early, am now sitting in my underpants and I am boring myself

00,10the new version of flash has some heavy security built in to it that is set to block alot of backdoor stuff from flash.
watching mpl while metelacalpce is playing on the tv......
00,10problem is it realy destablised it
/me I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!
RAWRity: hey were like this generations Trekkies Hopefully Hasbro knows this and decides to leave the Studio to keep making G4 instead of dumping it
Sumica: Backdoor stuff like what?
my house is going to explode
/me I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!
/me I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
00,10they dont go in to details
Ghost30k: depends on how much money they can make from this.
/me I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully tons
Welp I'm off to play TF2 later. ^_^
Lol
Cya
if they figure they can make more money from syndication, they'll dump the series after it reaches the required number of episodes.
00,10but there is a line you can add to the config file of flash to reduce the security and get flash to stop crashing.
http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/221804-im-so-fresh-you-can-suck-my-nuts
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
If i could, id stream some funny shit but i don't know how
Sumica: Wish I had the skills to do that.
/me I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!! A hero's gonna save me just in time!
I love that movie :P
ha
Ghost30k, only staff can stream
00,10they tell you how to do it.
00,10it's just a text file that you change
Sumica: Cool
GabeMoist: i know thats why im sad
Sumica: But knowing me, I'd probably do something and mess something up
Sumica: also now every time on Firefox, I get two white boxes. the stream embed doesn't do anything. The chat works, but not the stream
How many bits did it take Fluttershy to get that sweet ride?
I'm loving Pinkie's face
the more new people I see around here, the more I come to appreciate that the rgulars around here aren't whiny sacks of shit.

This stream needs more kerblings

Lol
Dark92Enigma: Take a look at what Sandy Frank did to Science Team Gathcaman, and compare that to DIC's Sailor Moon-- and see if you don't have a suddden desire to kiss DIC's collective rump. FOr the time, it was a pretty damn good localisation, where "Battle of the Planets" redefined butchery.
I smell some weird al...
polka face
My favorite is Applejack too
WEIRD AL FTW
Rainbow Dash is best pony

MahBoi777: Resistance. Is. Futile!
/me is ALSO PROUD
You will comply!
I'm a zombie and I'm proud!!!!

14o.o
HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY
Oh, we have a newb, you see
HEEEEEEEEEEEEE
WOOOOOOPPPP
HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY
YES.
Lunar_Brony: It's very simple. We are all, in our own ways, insane. I merely have tyhe longest history.
ah touhou, good tunes
3Alrighty, guys, I'm going to be heading off to bed. I won't be online tomorrow or the rest of this weekend for BronyCon. So if any of you are going, say hi to some of us at BronyState if we see each other.
3Anyways, goodnight.

goodnight SlurryMoon
Is anyone an old enough brony to have witnessed the 4chan fights....
Kencolt *eye twitch* did you say . . . insane?
Oh, I love UnanimousDelivers' PMV's
Night, Slurry. Take care.
Hope to see you at Bronycon SlurryMoon

03so heh @ this TV special I recorded
Bai Sumica
Lunar_Brony: Sanity is NOT a good idea here. Stop by on Brony Movie Night-- it will explain all.
goodninght SlurryMoon and Sumica, thanks for the stream
I should probably head to bed soon too for Bronycon
I envy those going to BronyCon :l
we still have sea ponies...
03we haven't even had TV Guide channel in years
03this is an old VHS
03but hey, that's kinda cool, I'm recording it to DVD
AttackWithHugs: i know that feel
AttackWithHugs: Then you're jelly of me -trollface-
i wanna go to bronycon :I
I was planning on going, but I don't have the funding
icybeauti: Yes, I am -okay.jpg-
icybeauti: hope I see you there too
PaladinDrakkenwolf: It's gonna kick ass
Pinkies4thWall: For me, its lack of money/job, distance, and school
I have neither the funding, the transport, of at the moment the health...
o-O
I'm lucky to live only about 45 minutes from the location
How many male characters are there in K-On? Only 1, IIRC. Ritsu's brother.
drf is easily amused
AttackWithHugs: for me it's atuclly the job that is the biggest problem
I have distance and transport, but couldn't find a job to get money to get there
icybeauti: So much envy
I'm driving, it takes like 3+ hours to get there from where I am if traffics okay
03well
Pinkies4thWall: Ohh.
and with these powers combined i am CAPTAIN PLANET
03I'm weeding out old VHS tapes
Kencolt yeah, I know how Movie Night gets. I used to consider myself sane. Last time I did, I made some concoction made of Gatorade, Iced Tea, Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, a can of Root Beer, and food colouring. When my mother saw it, she coined its name: "What the hell is that?!?"
AttackWithHugs: Yup. I'll tell you all how it went. I hope you guys can come one day and also check out the city.
MIND=BLOWN
icybeauti, where do you live?
03someon7e from the city had to come replace our water meter, so my parents cleared the cabinet out where that thing is
so what now?
03it's where I stored my entire librairy of recorded tapes
03so I figured, I prolly don't need most
d'aaawwwww . . .
03and so far I've thrown out 1/4 of them
I probably won't be around for next week's Trilogy. Stuff takes priority next week.
now, we dance the night away
anyone streaming?
GabeMoist: I live outside NYC, and the place in secaucus is only 15 mintues from NYC
lyra
nice, Lunar_Brony
03they're either random Pokémon episodes that are now on DVD or Disney Channel stuff my sisters wanted, and all of that can be found online also
If I drove, it would have to be about 8 hours punching about 70 or more cause I'd go at night when I-95 is mainly empty
octavia
And what waas it meant to be?
PONIES, TONIGH WE HUG IN HELL!!!!!!
/me puts on AcousticBrony music
AttackWithHugs: Wow man. Just save up and you can come one day. :)
Kencolt I'm aware of all the good things DiC has done......but i'm still pissed because they ruined one of the greatest animes of all time: Saint Seiya. Otherwise known as ''Knights Of The Zodiac''
Oh I can do video post now -yay-
They ruined Sailor Moon as well.
MahBoi777: gonna do uploads to tumblr in a bit
icybeauti: Wish I could. I live all the way down here in South Carolina. That, and if my parents let me, even though I'm 20 years old
03I actually found WB's trailer for that awful Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon special, which I digitized just for the heck of it :P
octavia is my favorite
but you hated that special
Wait
Then again, they were planning on ruining Sailor Moon about 20% worse.
why was it so terrible?
:p
Ohai everypony, I've been reading, the stream froze where there's a buncha filly ponies there and I feel so much daawwww
Pinkies4thWall: okey dokey lokey :3
icybeauti: IF they let me go out of state without my sis, they'd probably say to go with friends
drf hated the new voice actors
Oh, and the tumblr where translation of Japanese commemts in MLP:Fim is found at http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/ some are amazing.
Best pony is Rainbow Dash. If not Mane 6, Lyra Heartstrings.
AttackWithHugs: I've never been there. I've been to florida and virgina, and that's all of the southeast I've been exposed to.
MahBoi777: aircraft pony paints
hi
03those weren't even the. new VAs
03they were trials
hai glennglog22
hi glennglog22
03and since everybody haed it they found different ones
Oh, Sumica forgot to post the Sea Ponies video. Is that because he posted the whole OVA where it came from?
03to replace 4KIDS
..oh noes
o-o
Is college really like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgnb8hfXD0&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=7&feature=plpp_video
icybeauti: Farthest up north I've been is New Jersey and Maryland (seperate times) for a family reunion
well drf
The Japanese were very startle at the end of Episode 2-- they had been prepping for a season long epic, and, well...
you still hate the new VAs
03they actually back-translated it into Japanese XD
hey Biglaw and glennglog22
icybeauti a small percentage like tht
Pinkies4thWall: ooh nice
AttackWithHugs: Oh, new jersey is where it's being held....Well, it's northern jersey.
icyeauti from what I've heard, eeyup
icybeauti: Depends on what school you go to.
Dken2021: My brother is in college. For him, it's like that....
mind you, I'm going to take university
derp
The US Version of the Sailor Moon theme song is pretty good..........BUT NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL, that sounds like a musical poem to me
icybeauti: I've been wanting to save up for BronyCon since January but me not having a job and having class during summer....
I know one of my old roomates acted like that though
lol driver rehab
AttackWithHugs: Yeah, it's hard for people to get jobs nowadays. My brother was lucky to get one off one of my dad's old bosses.
what a weird show
Kandarihu How DiC would twist the knife (even MORE) on Sailor Moon
Dark92Enigma: It's not unusual for anime OP songs to haveNOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOW. In fact, it tends to be quite common.
if I was older, I would go to BronyCon. But I'm 15. And I live in Northern BC, Canada
icybeauti: That's today's world, unfortunately
03I'm watching Cops :|
AttackWithHugs: I pray that isn't how it's going to be when I get to that age....But I only have 4 years left till college.
They were planning on producing their own animation of Sailor Moon. Think the transition from Super Sentai to Power Rangers.
I wish I could go to BronyCon, but I'm moving houses on one of the days. That and it's really expensive to fly out.
it's like a youtube show
Lunar_Brony: You can go to everfree. It's in Seattle.
where they pull bad drivers off the road and put them through trainint
icybeauti: Like Engineer from TF2 says, "Start prayin' boy" (or girl if you're a female, lol)
training
lol
Kencolt FOR example: Dragon Ball Rock, UL-TI-MATE MUS-CLE, Digimon Adventure (Note: all of the mentioned are NOT the original themes in japan)
03I saw that Speeders show
AttackWithHugs: I will.
03which was quite funny as they literally let over half hte people go with warnings
03so I'm like, .what are you trying to show us?
this is just randomness
Kandarihu: Ah, the Infamous "saban Rangers", which had actually nothing to do withSaban, but another company. Who intended to have a live action cast that transformed into a bloody He-Man style animated world during battle.
Kandarihu, but strangely enough THERE IS A Live-Action Sailor Moon series (DUN DUN DUUUUUUN)
icybeauti: BUUUTT......RoundCon is coming up this August where I live and BanzaiCon is in October (in Columbia)
Dark92Enigma wasn't that a movie?
Dark92Enigma: Excuse me. The 54 year old Otaku here? You are telling me NOTHING new.
AttackWithHugs: I haven't heard of those 2. I've onyl heard of bronycon and everfree.
14lol
14I love when people make silly arguments on the internet
14(not here. In another forum)
lol
I'm not talking about the live action Sailor Moon. DiC was planning on COMPLETELY PRODUCING their OWN Sailor Moon series from scratch, using the original character designs and not much else.
14it makes you wonder how stupid people can be
icybeauti can't go anywhere, really. If I had a driver's license, a job, and a car, I would go.
Dken2021 No, i know for a fact that it was a series (IT WAS A MOVIE AS WELL???)
in a couple years, maybe
icybeauti: RoundCon and BanzaiCon and NashiCon (another one in Cola) are mainlyl anime conventions but there were a lot bronies at NashiCon this year)
but highly doubtful
Lunar_Brony: You're only a year older than me.
Kencolt LOL, I'm 19 years old, bro :D
00,10more or less yeah Kandarihu
Dark92Enigma well I remeber hearing about a live action movie, or was it a series?
AttackWithHugs: I live near comicon. I might go if I can and if cheerleading permits it.
Kandarihu: BZZZT! WRONG, but thanks for playing. DIC ALWAYS intedned to adapt theJapanese Sailor Moon. What you are thinking of is the abovementioned "Saban Moon", which was actually proposed by a company called-- IIRC-- Toon Partners.
icybeauti: Comic-Con? As in THE Comicon? Or just a state-wide convention?
Ah, okay.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgYnWtCC-Xk&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=6&feature=plpp_video Yeah, I'm goign to post vids till I hear "STREAM!" AttackWithHugs Yes, comicon NYC
I'm gonna sit here and play BTD5
DIC adapted the seris rather well, compared to how much anime at the time was-- frankly-- butcherd.
icybeauti: Cooool. I was thinking of the one held in California each year, but all the big states get the awesome worldly-known cons
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRe3h1iQ1Os&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=14&feature=plpp_video
AttackWithHugs: well, new york is pretty huge lawl.
To be clear, the live-action Sailor Moon was produced by Toei (which produced the Sailor Moon anime, the various Super Sentai series that were "adapted" into Power Rangers, and a large host of other Tokusatsu and anime series).
Anyhow,I'm off for now. Laters.
Dken2021 : Here's the link: (inb4 being banned again) http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Guardian_Sailor_Moon There's the proof
/me waves
03LOL, G4 making Chuck Norris jokes
bai kenco-- oh
icybeauti: And so is Cali. I was thinking that they should have Comic-con at like, SC because people will be renting hotel rooms lik crazy, which would help out the city
Bye Kencolt! (52 year old Otaku :D.....that made my day)
wish someone could stream
Dark92Enigma yea, I was thinking of that
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Guardian_Sailor_Moon
AttackWithHugs: Do you live in charelston or someplace like that?
Saban had nothing to do with Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon.
icybeauti: But because of the cost just at the door itself for something THAT big, it probably wouldn't work because people doen't have that kind of money unless they have a good job or saving forever
Kandarihu: I love sailor moon!
Me too. It's what got me into anime.
Kandarihu To quote Pinkie Pie, I posted that link first! :D
I wish my sister would just learn respect some time
03hi
Genndy, just.... wha? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb7MdnJFSxA
HI
Sailor Moon was my gateway to anime, not DBZ
Dark92Enigma: You posted the link to the Spanish Wikipedia. I changed es to en
I remember waking up at 5 to watch sailor moon
Tovler: Naruto was mine, but does it count? I found dailor moon through an AMV in 2nd grade. remeber AMVs?
Kandarihu (facehoof) damn my spanish heritage
Well, habits are hard to break.
somebody ping me please. Don't ask why, I jsut feel like being pinged
AttackWithHugs: I didn't know that. NYC was actually going to be the country's capital.
Lunar_Brony: PONG
Lunar_Brony: PIIIINNNGGGG
Kandarihu close enough
Lunar_Brony: Plang
Damn, I wanna work on my chapter, but I have a feeling I'll get nightmares....
icybeauti: Hell, people in SC that have good-paying jobs would probably have to save up a year in advance for soething like Comic-Con simply because it's so widely known. One of my friends told me that tickets were 100 dollars, and that's just at the DOOR.
I think I watched Sailor Moon afterschool on like CN. I don't remember
icybeauti: Capitals movin all over the US
icybeauti PaladinDrakkenwolf Kandarihu thank you, I'm obviously not going deaf
Lunar_Brony: good to know
Kandarihu Anyway, one of the HUGE problems with the live-action is that 1) Luna, the cat that turned Usagi/Serena into a Sailor Scout, is a VILLAIN!
i wish i knew away to raise volume
above 100%
Night, everypony. I got work tomorrow and packing to do.
14VLC?
03inw hat
03*in what
anything
AttackWithHugs: Wow. NY is one of those still pretty well off places in the counrty, so people could a fford that easy around here. Tovler They haven't had sailor moon on CN for YEARS. Prepare to feel old lol.
14you can on VLC up to 150% I think
most video sites like youtube and hulu
14you could up to 400% once
at max volume i can barely hear
03oh
I think sailor mercury was my first anime crush lol
anything else
03yeah you can in media players, not browser windows
Dken2021: I used to think tuxedo mask was HXC
like songs on winamp and games i can hear just fine
well yeah
Zoicite was my first anime girl crush.
i know VLC you can do it
Tovler: I had a huge crush on kakashi when I was younger.
icybeauti: Location, location, location. Plus NY is higher-paying than SC because it's much more expensive. It's all about location
Well, Sailor Moon was the series that got me into anime. And this is before I even first started using the internet. I was a pretty heavy fan at the time I got onto AOL, so I did some searching for more information. I found a huge list of all the changes that were made to the series, and I was absolutely heartbroken to read all that.
14mm
i'm just getting irritated of plugging in headphones everytime i want to watch something XD
14you should get a sound amplifier box
Technically, the first anime I remember seeing was Go Lion (Voltron)
AttackWithHugs: You should see how much gas is here. It's over 4 bucks. Is it that expensive where you live?
Hey guys :O Guess what movie I am watching with this quote:
lol
"Whoah"
icybeauti holy crap, expensive as hell
picture the alien meme guy
DeadlyPon3: The Matrix?
Dken2021: That's NY for you.
now picture the words in white bolded text
"laptop speakers"
:P Your no fuuuuun
DeadlyPon3: Bill and ted?
The first anime i grew up with is Speed Racer (IT COUNTS)
Keanu Reeves and all of his em-YES RYUNO!
Hatake Kakshi? That reminds me, I need to watch Naruto now that the War is finally on the anime.
icybeauti: VERY. A few years ago some gas stations ran out of 4's that summer because they didn't expect gas to go up that high
/me picks Speed Racer for A movie.
i have to watch that again
AttackWithHugs: Wow. A lot of our eurpoean bronies say the situation is worst there than it is here.
/me means the Speed Racer series (AKA MACH GO GO GO)
icybeauti: We all get scared as shit down here when gas hits the 3.50 mark. because we all know that it will steadily go up in the months that people travel a lot in
I remember watching Speed Racer...I was in 2nd grade when Cartoon Network started showing it...lol
And eating GOLDFISH :D
gas around here is usually expensive in the city parts, but it relatively cheaper on higways
Speed Racer was an odd movie. It was the perfect kind of Speed Racer movie, but it failed because the source material actually sucks.
AttackWithHugs: They say it's going down though/ There's one station in the town nextdoor that has gas that's I think like 3.59 a gallon and that's the cheapest probably in the state.
icybeauti: I would imagine so. Greece is in the red for sure, riots in Egypt a couple of years ago
gas is 3.51 here in Connecticut atm
They actually had to make shit up just to make it more exciting :p
Gas is almost 3 dollars a gallon. What a nightmare.
the only anime I remember watching was Yu Gi Oh: GX. But even then, I didn't watch much. I played Super Mario World and built stuff with lego instead
AttackWithHugs: Greece and Spain are in the worst places at the moment.
Tovler: It's more than 4 bucks where I live.
it's 5.60 over where I live at.
icybeauti: Sweet Celestia....
Ninjazz: Where are you?!
here, we complain that gas is 1.33 per litre
icybeauti: Tiny island called Saipan. It's a US Territory.
Lunar_Brony: Lucky bastard....
hi
hai Sweetie_Belle
Hi Sweetie_Belle
Ninjazz: Ah. Is that in the pacific?
icybeauti but what do you pay by? Like, gallons or something?
Lunar_Brony you must live on the edge of a city somewhere
icybeauti: Yes.
Lunar_Brony: We pay by the gallon here.
It's like that song: ♪It's the end of the world as we know it♪
Ninjazz: Luck guess.
Then, i Started watching Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z......Saint Seiya, Kinnikuman (since i'm from Chile, i know the original series before Ultimate Muscle) OH, And Pokemon, of course
Dken2021 I pay by litre, not gallon. Lemme find a gallon-litre ratio
brb
Sailor Moon is also on my list
<3
Dragon ball was actually my first anime. I remeber watching it very young.
oh, dang conversion
...I watched Sailor Moon and Techni Muyo :p
...And Hamtaro :p
And pokemon....God, most of us grew up around anime without realizing it.
1 litre is just over 4 gallons
The list of anime I've watched is too long to list on here.
Hamtaro, of course!!!!!!!!!
My first anime was Sailor Moon. 3pm and 3:30pm on Toonami, Monday through Friday
Hey, anybody here know how to get the newest version of Adobe Flash Player to work in FireFox?
DeadlyPon3: I'm getting childhood memeories :(
you have cheap gas compared to us
It's Hamtaro Time..
Ed Edd and Eddy :P
over 200 episodes of Hamtaro that I'll never get to see.
Lunar_Brony: Really? A gallon and a liter are that much of a difference?
I think my first anime was pokemon, then I moved to dbz when the neighborhood was crazy for it
Lunar_Brony: Oh, you're in canada.....Got it.
icybeauti yeah, 1 litre is ~ 0.26 gallons
Then at 4:00 and 4:30 it was DragonBall, 5 and 5:30 was DragonBallZ and 60'clock was CartoonCartoon
Lunar_Brony: o.O
Unbelievably, the only anime I remember watching before I was about 15 years old was Go Lion.
6 o'clock*
BTW , since i live in Chile, i know all the original songs for most of the animes i watched
I rushed home from Kindergarden to watch Techni Muyo
http://steamcommunity.com/id/eddmario/screenshot/559820086472430298
F YEAH
FINALLY
drf I was up til 4am yesterday/today doing my software project
I usually watched whatever my odler brothers were watching. There was a lot of pokemon, dragonball z and just ball, and a lot of old nick and CN and old disney too.
...Do you believe in Maaaaagic?
I wrote 900 lines of code in a language I've never done before in 2 days
:}D
IN A YOUNG GIRL'S HEART!
03I failed programming
MMMPH MMMMMMPH MMMMPH!
W-Where do you believe in magic, Icybeaut?
._.
Old Nick, CN and Disney, WHAT HAPPENED???
03gotta retake that crap -_-
Dark92Enigma: Ikr?
He isn't here, is she?
MPPPPPPPPPPPPPPH
Eddmario: dat first screenshot
That old ROCK AND ROOOL!!
"HEEELLP!"
MPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPH
Dark92Enigma: Shit. That's what happened
Dark92Enigma we grew up, plus network execs that aren't that smart
DeadlyPon3: Add that to the list.....
icybeauti you get your gas about 10 cents cheaper than us. AND oil went down to $0.60 per barrel, but the price of gas hasn't budged. If anything, it's still going up
Seriously, ANYBODY know how to get flash to work with firefox after the newest update?
.-.
:s
I will do C/C++ for you
Lunar_Brony: Crud...And I thought the situation was a tad better....xP
But not java
"He's not here, is she?"
nice HML
in what language?
nono
Not /my/
Eddmario: is it not working for you at all?
I compiled Cinnamon desktop
:|
I still imagine him as a HE
Oh
._.
Since I decided it was so buggy
Eddmario: I don't know. My friend has that same issuewith flash. it told her to update flash so she did but when she opened firefox, it said she didn't update
I discovered today
I should do something about the lack of updates
that my laptop's battery issues
was not the battery itself
but linux
It's going to be fun telling our grandkids "e grew up in probably the worst era, but we got through with a little thing called PONIES!"
Kandarihu: Nope. Have to use IE for stuff like YouTube and BronyState.
for some reason linux drains the battery
You just figured it out?
o-o
windows lasted for hours
03:/
no...
I know right?
I think it's cinnamon, HML
DeadlyPon3: "I fear no man, but that thing...."
Try using CPU scaler applet
cus' mint 9 didn't drain my battery
oh wait I'm not gonna have grandkids....
For Cinna
That helps a bit
wheeeere?
Eddmario mine works but crash a lot ...
"One shutters to imagine what goes behind that MASSSk..."
under the cinnamon applet section
cinna noms battery
still no stream ._.
either that or my crapload of processes is
Cause nopony is STREAMING :O
Do you believe in magic..... In a Young girls heart

AttackWithHugs: I hear the southern summers are brutal, especially when you don't have an ocean.
Ponies47: Why whats happening
Eddmario you know exactly what you were really talking about
icybeauti: You heard right -lol
there is a chance of t-storms in afternoon here :(
I'm gonna celebrate it by finishing editing my first fic and releasing it, not a pony fic mind you but a fic nontheless
Ponies47: I'm not going to be here for 2 movies nights, or even be able to coem here for 2 weeks. I'm goign to another country.
Lunar_Brony I was using the word's proper meaning
I might have to miss next week's Trilogy event, as well as that week's BMN and EMN
Iron_Edge: New York has worst sumemrs than a lot of people think
Ghost30k: Hanging out with friends on Friday. Saturday I'm leaving to go to Michigan which is boooooring which means no computer or ponies until Monday. :'(
:P is there a movie playing??
icybeauti: 76 now. And yes they are! It's not so bad on the ocean because the air cools it off a tad bit but for the rest of us where there's literally no water except for Lake Murray and some rivers...better get a few bags of ice cause you'll need it
nada Mr
Mr: Nope
Mr nothing is on stream currently
Ponies47: THE HORROW
Im leaving. Good night and bye bye!!!! ;)
oh ok
Mr:nope
I want a mlp movie and a spin-off series featuring background ponies and cameos from the main cast.
icybeauti: Heat doesnt so much bother me. But at times it can get so hot just breathing makes your entire mouth dry -lol
Ghost30k: I know It Is
Good night, rupeescreamer
gnihgt rupeescreamer
Mr Not a movie, it's the second-most-loved cartoon of all time: The Buffer Show
nighty rupeescreamer
THE
WORST
POSSIBLE
THING!
Thanks, Good night!!!

AttackWithHugs: I just go to a lot of malls and stuff. Iron_Edge My fam doesn't use the ac much...:P
oops :$
I got kicked :$
for a second there i actually believed the buffer show existed
Ponies47: hey you don't have to go through just joining the Herd only to realize that after S3 ends and G4 closes Im gonna be sad as FUCK
AttackWithHugs: They say it's going to be hot here for the next few days
Ponies47: I joined last week bro
Mr it does exist, you gotta beleive!
icybeauti: Even that seems to not help because a lot of people go to the mall too. All that body heat.....but the fountains should be nice and cool....
I'd give mlp to at least season four, probably five
Ghost30k: Wait S3 is the last season?
/me checks the weather thingy
Ponies47 no it's not the last season
i believe in magic and magic only.
Ponies47: that's what everyone's saying
icybeauti: Mmmm 2012...triple-degree weather and people going batshit crazy like never before
What's science?
AttackWithHugs: -lol you cant jump in the fountains ya' silly fily :P I know...I tried when I was little
not some crazy "buffer show"
We don't know for sure. It could be, but they haven't said whether it is or not.
Ponies47: and it's only 13 episodes to add insult to injury
Ponies47: Going with what we know Faust ha worked on in the past, it'll get at least 6 seasons, and at leat 1 movie
grooviebones it's the stuff that goes boom
Iron_Edge: Mall cops?
ello everypony!!!
13 eps and a movie hopefully
AttackWithHugs: -lol no I was too short :P
Dken2021: *sighs* Thank goodness because I was just about to go off and kick my step brother butt
Ponies47 unless S3 bombs (which it won't), FiM will live on to see many more episodes after S3
Ghost30k actually 13 episodes are split with separate studios
AttackWithHugs: -lol but also yeah Mall cops :P
When's friendship express coming out?
OK........gotta go everypony........gonna get some sleep
icybeauti: Lucky! lol
Dken2021: OHHH OK

http://derpy.me/WroUC
Dken2021: THANK YOU FOR TELLIGN ME :)
grooviebones: I'm pretty sure it's been out for a couple of months now
Ghost30k: No. There's 26 episodes 13 are being mad by Studio B and the other 13 are being made by anthor company
damn. according to the weather report it'll be hot
Iron_Edge: stupid mall cops, don't they realize that if you live INLAND of a state, you should have the right to at least stick your feet in the fountains, provided you don't start stripping? :D
bye
la la la
my computer was jerkin so much that TF2 crashed!!! :(
Do they have a release date yet?
icybeauti: Gotta love the summer

MLP= mario_pony Loves panda :3
If I was a mod, I would be a mod.
So I put a stream in your stream
:D
AttackWithHugs: the british chick tat pushed me into watching ponies finally restarted watching season 2 :$
If I became a mod, I wouldn't be able to stream because my computer only has 2GB of RAM
MadSurge: Sweet
I have class today, So burring :
How many gigs would you recommend?
AttackWithHugs I have no idea how much mine has
uno momento por favor mon amicos
Biglaw: You can check under Control Panel
ooh
I've got about 6 gigs
okay
:3
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5210/
:)
Espeen mis señoles... le traile yo un tequila.... <_< Spanish?
grooviebones: Someone I watch stream their art recommends at least 8GB or more
grooviebones: for effecient streaming
http://fly-by-the-pegasus.tumblr.com/
Interesting... I'll never stream anything but still cool to know
Muffin!? :P

Wow... I have LESS than a gig of RAM

How do I survive the internet?!?!

Muffins! :D
Biglaw: processors?
Biglaw: Geez, that's HORRIBLE
I used to have less than a gig when I played starcraft, I dunno why I played at 2 fps for months
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Streaming if we were mods and how much RAM our computers havde

AttackWithHugs: ohhh
Yo soy un pofresor de ESPAÑOL... Y LES ENSEÑARE A HABLAr.... <_< I need Google Translate :S
I have 0.99GB of RAM
:I
lol i'd stream most halos and stream some cool videos no one seen
/me has 8 gb ram
As long as you have a 64 bit processor you can get just about as much ram as you want installed
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4888/ <- Good thing my brother doesn't know Soarin from MLP because we named are new kiitten Soarin and my bro hates MLP and bronies :)
(\ (<_<) Oh look one stream
Biglaw: Good god....they coould have at least given you the whole 1GB
I know... That .01GB was too much to spare
Ponies47: Sweet
I have 1kb of muffin :P
Hopefully I'll get a new computer, I have a desktop, but it cannot connect to the internet :/

Hallo Bronystate.
I had to free up about 40 gb of data a few hours ago so as to get my games running semi-smoothly again.
ALL THE THINGS
AttackWithHugs: My brother pretty much hates me. The thing he hates me for the most is being a brony. I DON'T CARE I'M A BRONY AND PROUD! :)
Need Linksys? 6_9
I watching MY little pony Friendship is magic only on youtube :P
Ponies47: His loss lol. You should tell him that hate is a strong word to describe something. Tell him that dislike is much better (tldr be a grammar nazi when he says he hates bronies)
Ponies47 "I'M UGLY AND I'M PROUD!" Spongebob
grooviebones: What did you use to do that? And what's your OS?
Hal hitler 6_9
Ignorance is bliss indeed
(\6_9
Curse this Compaq netbook... It's practically the size of the area of a regular keyboard
:I
:S
AttackWithHugs: HA! One day I asked my brother 'How can you judge a show if you never watched it?' He had no answer. He just thinks just becasue it's MLP is gonna be awful. HIS LOSS!
Biglaw: :d
259 gigs on my OS, and Just a lot of youtube videos, a guy ran through about five things to clear up about 20 gigs and the rest came from manually deleting old movies, big thing is deleting temp files
Ponies47 :I
Ponies47: Exactly.
P47: That's just the way people are. And it's up to us to break the stigmas and shatter society itself.
HI EVERYPONY :D
03> ... *slow clap*
03> "Ice warning: what may come"
03> "Roads will be icy"
03> If you can't figure that out, you probably deserve to slip on a road
Why can't I have a full gig of RAM? Does technology hate me that much?
OH.. Is too late , sorry :'(
I need moar Random Access Memory
I heard that everything over half of your OS used is just slowing down performance
system32
...
grooviebones: Mmm...I have about 110GB used on my computer and I'm trying to clean it a little so I have more free space
Random OST http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8eWxNXkEjo :3
AttackWithHugs: eeyup. He just thinks that it's just gonna be ponies having tea parties an (squee). Pfft. He's so wrong! To bad I can't make him sit down and shuda up and watch an episode but like I said, HIS LOSS!
*and
You internet is too slow?... Delete System32..... By: Princess trollestia company
the last time I checked, I had about 68Gigs free on my hard drive
AttackWithHugs: Reducing the space of your recycling bin can be a big help too, it saved me about 10 gigs of free space
Ponies47: Play a pony song that no one would even think it was made by bronies
:(
Sending things straight to deletion and skipping recycling bins saves good space
grooviebones: I do that too. I use Disk Cleaner, CCleaner, Advaned System Care...
AttackWithHugs: hmmmmmmm. Got any good ones?
grooviebones: Also, how do you skip the Recycle Bin if you delete something? It'll end up there
104
http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oy680t5BjvU/hqdefault.jpg this is my netbook :p
You netbook is very cool :O
AttackWithHugs: Right click recycle bin, properties, from there you can select your settings straightaway
It's tinier than a mini appletini
Aw/Hugs: That's how I converted my friend.
grooviebones: ohhh
I had 10 gigs of potential space being reserved
It has no disk port
:/
disk drive
Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4aM_S5fyoM
derp
Biglaw: wowwwww
I have no idea <_< >_>
Ponies47: Don't tell him who it's by until afte the song and if he likes it
It has three USB ports, and an sd card port
Ponies47: But don't press him if he says no.
and that's just about as good as it gets
(\(<_<)
Shizuka! Are you here?
(\:O/)
00,02every game wants me to install a bunch of crap
Hey Phase4!
Phase4: They demand space to feed on
yay :(
You are here, and yes, games suck like that
Ohei Phase4!
Steam takes up a horrid amount of space...
00,02oooo, new alex s
Phase4 .... Yay :(
Phase4 want to see my netbook? :p
AttackWithHugs: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5475/ I'm liking your idea :)
grooviebones: I would do that but the probem is with doing that to recycle bin is sometiems I accidentally delete songs from my music library. If I delete it off the coputer, I have to find the songs, and redownload it
00,02Biglaw, sure

Ponies47:
Phase4 it has no disk drive :I
Hey anypony seen Pinkies4thWall?
00,02Biglaw, wholy owned by hp
AttackWithHugs: You could always just reduce the reserved space, Around 3000 if you want to be safe, but no music should take up more than a hundred MB unless it's like a few albums or something
(\:O/) Pinkie pie is here
00,02Biglaw, yeah, they tend not to

RainbowMuffin: (\

I am making my own Brony atm :)
Relax I play LA Noire, i'm like sherlock holmes and shit
"Insert Police Squad Theme Song"

00,02needs more synchronizing
:P
CollapsedTyme I say a nice, light brown
grooviebones: I would if I had the money for an external hard drive and to get one of my USB ports fixed. I'd get a 500GB drive though so I could back it up on that, and then delete EVERYTHING off the computer. fresh start
They only video game I ahve ever finish is Infamous 2 on the PS3 otherwise I SUCK AT VIDEO GAMES! :D
Is this game demanding on pc's? I've got a gift copy and i'm debating whether or not to open it or give it to a friend

Social Club? Pfffft
Don't do it phase. Peer presure is never good
My eyes are too red like a apple Q-Q :'(
Who's streaming? There are no ponies to tell me
RainbowMuffin: Cold washcloth on your face
GabeMoist Phase4
Ahh
'Tis a rare stream
AttackWithHugs: OK
I just found out today that getting a better graphics card for my laptop is next to impossible and on top of that voids my warranty completely
00,02der we go
MY eyes are too blue like a iceberg :P
RainbowMuffin: that should work
00,02grooviebones, laptops are like that
grooviebones aawwwww, get a new laptop?
No, Get a desktop!
Groovie: yea, labtops have integrated graphics cards, that are difficult to switch out
L.A. Noire :$
You kdding me? This laptop was 1300 and i could barely afford that back in the day, next comp will definitely be a desktop
Build yourself a nice desktop instead.
Soouuuunnnd
grooviebones: That sucks completely. I have to get a new hard drive for my othe computer and it doesn't matter if it voids the warranty because said warrantly already expired a year ago
if my brony was light brown wat color should his mane be???
i want to look kind of cynical
Green obviously
maybe i should use grey
instead
Silver?
Feals like playing more TF2. LATERS
CollapsedTyme: Black or anything dark...or white
Ponies47, EARLIERS
My dream desktop is going to have 8 gigs of ram, 500 gig hard drive, dual graphics cards, 1024MB video card and look kryllin, it's not too insanely pricy, so give me a few years and i'll have uit

grooviebones: Depending on what your're going to be using it for, that is....
Hollywoodland?

00,02wonder if he likes this city
Phase4: you dont say...

Phase4, just hold forward. I hated it too
OtakuTom: he saids it was DayZ xD
Shamroc: who wouldnt do it, its the most troll tempted mod ever
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: then i stole his shoty and found an ak

Phase4: the one with all the names and numbers

The one thing I don't like about this game is they let you solve the crimes even if you fail at every single interrogation.

00,02Shamroc, it saves?
00,02eh well, might as well try

run Forrest!
00,02so i did
you aim and then it will fire a warning shot
RUN
Phase4: aww if you had it for the PS3 I'd play it with you it's really fun
you do not pull the trigger yourself, Phase4
Phase4: it was telling you HOW to aim and shoot....
you just aim until it does it
00,02how bizare

00,02FairysHuff, i meen spend five minutes looking at the stuff thats on tor
00,02FairysHuff, some of it is the grey area 'oh its illegal but not realy hurting anyone'

DOOM 1 and 2 are awesome
you know you have played too much doom when you know more orless all the maps
Doom are the first game of shooter in 1 person :P...
Lil_B: i have both DOOMs on xbox live arcade
only maps that are a bit fuzzy are the 2 last chapters of doom 1. doom 2 is easier to remember and plutonia/TNT are so unique in their maps
I go make something very light to eat. Make tummy good I hope.
Rainfall_Night I played them via DOSBox for the first time last year
doom 3 was a step in the right direction when it came to modernize the franchise but it lost the mindless killing in the same fasion. resurrection of evil did right what doom 3 did not

in controls
also whe nyou configure keys
make sure trigger 1 and 2 are bound to mouse button 1 and 2 respectively
you can set change weapons to Q and E
makign switchign weapons easy
aswell as move the use button to space
then the controls should be set

Kammerjunk: Yup
woah robo-rarity looks awesome

you may aslo want to set it to the "dark" brightness setting
Now if only I didn't live across the ocean.
00,02suddenly full screen
aswell as under player, set the difficulty to major damage
And guys from FiW, writers
what Kammerjunk siad.
...And was 15.

I was hoping Bronystate would stream it
I can kick butt at level 38 in Altar of Infinity
i rember this game

Kammerjunk: i have the same problem, as well.
I'd go there even though I live in Denmark, but I'm 15.

/me is not a Halo fan, sorry
MegaMoonShine: if you know your geography, im very close to the beach on the swedish side of the little water stream between sweden and denmark
silence.
complete silence
Vacation_Wrek: Oh cool :)
and no one answers my question
MadSurge: marathon isnt halo so youre safe there.
MD4confusedbselect: takes time to write a proper anaswer
00,02Vacation_Wrek, is there a jump button?
This is Marathon?
gtfo youtube and dubstep
relax dude
00,02well
erm.. if youre anti-brony, whya re you even here?
00,02that was strange
00,02he left
now. actively goign to bronies adn tellign them that bronies are shit basically, is trolling. having an oppinion that bronies are not good. but not actively tomenting bronies about it, is not trolling
Sorry. I know I asked too many times.
Vacation_Wrek: This looks more like a classic FPS
^^^
/me 11,01is the jump button
/me pushes the Jump Button
Phase4: : no jump button
00,02lol
/me 11,01explodes
00,02just run and it works
but running over an edge
00,02logic
ou can kind of "gliide"
/me dusts up the Jump Button residue
glide*
Vacation_Wrek: and that's how trolling bronies is.
holy lord my mouse wheel is squeaky. why? D:
MadSurge: cause it is. marathon 1 came out about a year after the first doom. both were developed durign the same time more or less.
the one he is playing right now is marathon 2, which came out 95 iirc
00,02the names need more commas
^ :D
11,01Apostrophes?
aye
funfact: my name came from the name Wrk'ncacnter. which is a figure in the marathon series. when i used the name as a wow character the guys on TS didnt bother pronouncing it so they began callign me Wrek.
00,02this is realy not my kind of game
valoreins|Drawing: :'(
00,02Nittany_Discord, thats the word
So, are you trying to stop an alien invasion in this game or what?
MadSurge: more like an occupation
aliens occupying other aliens. and you are there in a like "enemies of my enemy is my pal" kidna thing
MegaMoonShine: someone from KYM comment like this even "To be precise, Faust wrote the Apples as if they were three orphaned siblings living with their grandmother, but their deaths are not canonical and Hasbro may well bring them back in the future if they so choose."
valoreins|Drawing: :'( :'( :'( :'(
/me wants an episode about AJ's parents asking for her help in their OTHER applefields
is it really sad to see a death reference in a cartoon like MLP for children>
?*
I really hope we do get to see them at some point
Hay guise, what's going on in here, how are you all doing?
ohai AgentKalim
Hay AgentKalim
So I checked the past movies list, and found out that the last time I was to this site (before I started coming here again) was 16.3.2012. Just sayin. :P
Ohai AgentKalim!
Hello, valoreins|Drawing MegaMoonShine and MadSurge
That's a lot of time
I know :P
I was a bit preoccupied with school at the time and forgot. :P
:<
We're watching Phase4 struggle with Marathon and discussing AJ's parents
00,02Vacation_Wrek, i'm not disliking it, but its not the kinda thing i enjoy
Okaay
00,02i will say that the controlls 'just work'
00,02its kinda suprising
:D
Well since my day just started (3 hours earlier than normal), I might as well say good morning as disgruntled as possible
tea and biscuits at 10 past 12 in the morning
like a sir
Phase4: just hopign you last untill the more actiony levels kick in
AttackWithHugs: aww cranky :(
nothign beats the larger rooms with cyborks runnign about
Cyborks? :P
There's Orks in this game? :P
MadSurge: Yes. I am not a morning person and I don't like waking up earlier than 10 or 11 unless I have someplace to go, like a morning class or watching my niece.
Niece? You got a bigger bro/sis?
Hai everypony :3
Hey Spell-of-Gaming!
Those torso-jawed things remind me of somthing....
Hello, Spell-of-Gaming
inb4 ded
MadSurge: Yesh. My older sister
AgentKalim: Beyond Good and Evil?
Ooh, #bronystate was created on Sept. 14, 2011!
00,02thats it for me
00,02what else do i have
11,01I'm off as well.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA-lSdhy564
YES! Beyond Good and Evil, thanks MadSurge
hay Phase4, were you playing Portal after you were playing L.A. Noire?
Bye Nittany_Discord! Catch ya later
00,02AttackWithHugs, i was playing quantum conundrum
00,02might do la-noire again
00,02it was suprisingly fun
AttackWithHugs: Portal doesn't have Discord berating you :D
Phase4: Okay. All I saw was blue and orange and these weird soccer ball looking things that you shot through some king of hoop
Feel free to do whatever you want. :P I'm sure it'll be fun to watch.
Phase4: You got VVVVVV?
MadSurge: Discord in Portal? How?
AttackWithHugs: No, Discord in Quantum Conundrum
00,02Vordox, no
AttackWithHugs: John DeLancie is your guide in Quantum Conundrum :D
Oooh, VVVVVV! <3
00,02i think i played this game
maaan
00,02http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/511754
I have to pay like 20k to enter this dungeon but it's fun ):
Time fcuk
sounds like a good idea
Loading the future
00,02i've actualy played this and dont realy want to again
Phase4: Would you like to try something? :P
00,02good puzle game though
00,02Vordox, sure
http://www.explodingrabbit.com/games/super-mario-bros-crossover
Oooh, Time Fcuk!
MadSurge: mmmmm....I knew that voice had a charm to it for some strange reason
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA-lSdhy564
WHY MUST I FEED MYSELF ON THE DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOK SERIES
What are you talking about? :P
AttackWithHugs: DeLancie really has a charming voice :)
MadSurge: Mmmm he does. You could fall asleep in his lap like a baby just listen to him ramble on about anything
AttackWithHugs: that's one voice I'd go gay for ;D
Tony Jay still rules. From heaven. Just saiyan.
MadSurge: I think that's one voice any brony or Trekkie would probably go gay for.
Super mario cross brosover
Good luck Phase4
AttackWithHugs: my dad is a casual trekkie :D
MadSurge: so the both of you get a share of that sexy voice. Star Trek and MLP
oo
You played Super Mario Bros before? :P
Good afternoon everypony
Who DIDN'T play Super Mario Bros before? :P
Morning, killerpony7733
Hello, killerpony7733
AgentKalim: Me. When I got my PS1, my parents sold my sister's NES
I see
well...
00,02dat was fun
AgentKalim: Yeah....I missed out on fun
Phase4: BUt not for you? :P
But everyone knows the Warp zone from somewhere, don't they?
00,02eh, its mario
Okay you want something you can think about...
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/518729
This one is ffamous
00,02theres a fair ammount of complexity thats just dumped on you
It's where Braid was stol...I mean Inspired from, but with a mix. :P
Good job :P
00,02i've heard about this one
Poor Megaman XD
SHOOT
You can't jump on enemies with non-mario characters, remember.
oh good god
They play exactly as the original games
^
you know sometimes
AttackWithHugs: not really, it's the italian dub Star Trek :D
support must get REALLY bored
That's the entire point of the crossover. :P
TL;DR
MadSurge: Awww. But MLP has John de Lancie so happy tiems. I bet his voice excites the fans
MadSurge: Singing voice*
AttackWithHugs: certainly female fans get excited about him :D
for reference, my username is UnFoundBug - http://theadmin.co.uk/images/stories/1340972947-0cJxbT.jpg
00,02what the
Ohman extremely basic tutorial, that'sprettygreat
MadSurge: What female wouldn't with a voice like that? A natural voice, too?
Inb4 Puzzlefuck XD
AttackWithHugs: NOBODY :D
MadSurge: EXACTLY
And that's how you solve problems. :P By commiting suicide repeatedly.
._.
There's a reason he can do this
DED
Press R Faster when about to die, Phase4 ;)
back
Hai Vacation_Wrek
so yeah Phase4: not your cup of tea huh?
This game is HARD
That's what she said
But so puzzlefuck, and this is only the third. XD
00,02Vacation_Wrek, ueaj
00,02yeah'
You call this puzzlefuck? :P
00,02this is bizare
Phase4: after you play this you should play the prequel (Fixation)
Just wait Phase4, it gets more puzzley soon
Man this is easy, wait for some of the later ones.
AttackWithHugs: I enjoyed that clip where hammy Q says "au contraire mon capitain" :D
MadSurge: Doesn't even have to try.
No
OH YEAH
00,02oh wow
Why are you falling down :P
THIS PART
Time to mindbuck big time. XD
00,02wow

I think you forgot to press the button :P
Forgot the A button :P
OH THIS
Meh
Think reality time wise.

Wait for the shadow to move and then ride it!
^
MadSurge: That's one way
Love the soundtrack to the game, and I love the one to Fixation even more
Chat derped

I am fairly certain I cried a little bit at this game
let`s play something happy
There she goes
We are basically 3 or 4 minutes behind
Now to wait to get tow hitch wires installed.
I return after having a shower, food and nap. Pain killers haven't helped but still feel a little better.
00,02i cant see how to do this
FairysHuff: Thats good :)
Flower
what happened?
There's ON easy solution to this and I love it XD
Welcome back, FairysHuff
Second flower
That yellow thing
/me sniffs flower
on the right
killerpony7733: Hows yee?
AgentKalim: Thankee
who`s that on steam?
FairysHuff: Fairly good but there was alot of lighting and rain last night, It came so close it striked right down at a power box that was less then some 20-30 ish meters away....:(
Never been active on Bronystate in the morning.
FairysHuff: I have slept quite little due to that
hi everypony
Hello, BrOnyxia
killerpony7733: Awesome ^_^ Wish I was there
dat jump XD
phase4 can i add you on steam?
lol that was me chatting him
xD
bronyxia whats his name?
12,1Test
Bye NITt :P
FairysHuff: I hate lightning especially when it strikes down in a power box that shuts off the power in the whole block and imagine the god damn bang as it's so close you hear it instantly :S
Ohai nittany. Didn't see you in my sleep deprived state
Let's see if Phase4 can solve this one
Ahh shit.
killerpony7733: I love violent weather myself.
Me too.
He got it pretty quick
FairysHuff: .......I don't
00,02i know how
00,02its doing it thats hard
PHASE
hehe
WAIT
whats your steam name?
Violent weather is best weather (most of the time)
dukedontnukem: just phase4
k
Nittany_Discord_Phon: Agreed. We need more of it.
Phase4, you need to stack them all first, then run across
00,02wait
Nittany_Discord_Phon: Heck no i hate it when lightning strikes down less then those 20 30 meters :D
00,02i have more than one shadow thing
00,02on, top left
00,02oh'
00,02i see now
BrOnyxia i said STEAM name

dukedontnukem: well w8... http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025082755/ here

FairysHuff: It's called mods.
Nittany_Discord_Phon: I'm thinking more spacey.
It's a start.

:p
AgentKalim: £30 for New Vegas on steam. Aint paying that
Did stream just die?
no
valoreins|Drawing: Played it
he isafk
Must be my end
00,02they fall into each other
watched the extended endings?
Phase: just get lots of extras
valoreins|Drawing: If you mean of ME3 then no. I'm holding off on getting it till it goes on sale.
ok
Yeah, me too.
00,02interderps
oh
phase you have a nice varity of steam games play one of those
Poor Phase4
00,02this one's got me
00,02i *could* jump of myself
And you should.
00,02but i experimented with that earlier, you bug through yourself
If only there was something like Unreal 2 but with an open world like elder scrolls.
I'mma be honest, I just spammed jumping shadows
00,02its not imposible, just horribly dificult
00,02bad puzle for the engine
lets play your steam phase
Spam ALL the jumping shadows.
Phase: not all the time, If you are going opposite directions you collide
As in one up one down
Oh god this double jumping stuff XD
00,02SOO MUCH LAG
There's no lag unless you have a bad computer.
Your doing it wrong phase :o
Cloooose!
dat kage bunshin
But it works
YAY!
Hooray it worked.
00,02that ending was unexpected
00,02allso i think it was unneseciary
Either my skull is getting too small for my brain or my brain is getting to big for my skull. ~_~
00,02i cannot spell
What a twist.
It makes the story so sad phase
Play fixation now
FairysHuff: Whut :D
00,02didnt need it attached to Actual murder
Fixation is another puzzle game
no murder involved
00,02that was worthwile

Second one works
killerpony7733: hard to cocentrate and vision keeps blurring
anyone played egophiliac's new game yet?
00,02oh
There is a lot of dialouge
00,02so thats what it looks like to you guys
yeah P
killerpony7733: yeh. What I would give to be able to have regular coherent thought ^_^ heh
That's not how it's supposed to look. :P
But it really adds a lot of deep story to the company of myself
00,02i might play that later
It's so small, I can't read anything. :P
Phase4 :( don't play if you are going to skip story
That is just rude to the game
00,02one more hour of la noire then bed
00,02story is the interesting bit
Alrighty. Thanks for streaming everything you have and staying up late to entertain us.
Morning guys

teen pop included?
Hey hey hey
valoreins|Drawing I don't think so XD
it's not about the genres :P
FAIL PHASE
lol taking bullets like a boss
in the head maybe?
HIs hand
Just shoot him in the head
ALWAYS aim for the hands
Or the hand
that also works
AgentKalim: yeah the hand with the gun in it
/me takes
AgentKalim yeah, I mostly just listen to a song and say that i ether like it or don't like it, but some genres has more favours then others for me :)
That's the best way, really. :P
NAO!
Of course there's always some favourites
NAOW
00,02well
00,02i shot his arm
00,02and he kept shooting
goood shot
00,02i shot his arm twice
I think you missed that one time
00,02which meens i hit once
Try shooting the hostages foot to see what happens
How about fanning his arm?
00,02time to re-do that again
I just want t o see how the masked man would react
i remember this
JUST SO ALL MODS KNOW
Hello, everypony.
Hello, MasterBoss43
And it's Friday
shoot yourself and see how he reacts... i bet it will confuse him
there
LOL DAT AIM
i got the brodrick suite for preordering the game.
Wow, you could've just tackled him right there, but nope, not in the script.
go cole
Who is livestreaming now?
Go Cole train
Make sure to hit the hand or head. :P Hand preferably
phase4
00,02well shit
OH ok.
Oh, ok*
shoot his head
00,02Rainfall_Night, ?
Oh nevermind
Shoot his head
00,02i dont want to hit is head
00,02incapacitate doesnt meen kill
Let's try that one more time. :P
00,02stupid game
right in the gun maybe
or lets shot the hostages head and see what happens :/
The hitbox is really finicky
i wish its a homing bullet or something
SHOT ARM, HE DIED?
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
but that would make the game easy
Howdy, Sylandest
ohai Sylandest
Hey Sylandest!

Omfg that inability to tackle :P
/me hugs AgentKalim, valoreins|Drawing, MadSurge, Lil_B

Oh yeah
that
00,02different colour
what a badass
Lil_B: That's meee
Like a boss

Well, hitting him in the head is still easier than hitting him in the arm.
apparently
Phase4: Dat script :p
and no bucks given for driving
Y u driving like GTA :P
Sylandest: Hiya
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE
http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6720/20120630012410.png

Looking good
lol driving like GTA
negotiation is for pussys
Sylandest: Has your day been good?
Indeed XAX
killerpony7733: well, i had a good sleep, so so far, yes, lol.
I think the first GTA style game i will ever play will be LEGO Cities Undercover for the WiiU :)
Lemme guess, LA Noire?
solid citizen
:O their faces are so detailed
Sylandest: I slept poorly last night, there was a real god damn violent lighting storm here we had like 30 strikes in one minutes some places, Even had lighting strike almost 20 or 30 meters away in a power box
Ok I admit it. I spaced out haaaaaard there for ages. Just staring into space. I miss anything?
FairysHuff: not really, back to LA Noire :D
MadSurge most realistic In-game faces in gaming so far
FairysHuff: well, i came on :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUTOaFs40Vk&feature=g-all-c
killerpony7733: jeez! Is everything alright on your end?
00,02there is a LOT of blood in that car
Sylandest: *Resists urge to make innuendo joke*
FairysHuff: ha! I walked into that one....XD
Sylandest: Yup ^_^
Progress has indeed been made in my minecraft endeavours, and i would love to continue...
Phase4 someone probably swallowed Dynamite
but it just ticked over half 1
so ima go to the sleeps.
Night guize :3
night, XAX!
Bye XAX :)
Sylandest: I just slept poorly and were awake quite a bit while it was there, Imagine the shock you feel when you hear and see a lighting bolt strike in a power box very close by and shutting off power :(
Goodnight, XAX
More than 6 pints?
00,02Lil_B, makes sense
00,02night XAX
Victim must've lost ALL of their blood, in fact :P
killerpony7733: it must've been pretty...wait for it...shocking? XD
stay gold, guize.
You too
Anyone want to play Borderlands with me? I've still to download it so not right this minute.
/me tries to not watch too much of the stream because he wants to play LA Noire without being spoiled
MadSurge, LA Noire, I love that game...
"Ey Jimmy, why is this guy running against this pole?"
Yeah you walk under that ladder
Sylandest :|
Sylandest: Oh the pun! :D But yeah it was god damn scary to have it strike so close by we even had the window open just a tiny tiny bit and the bang was sooo loud :S
Phase4: You any chance having Mirror's Edge+
?
trollhunter: XD
00,02dat womman looks like a man
killerpony7733: i couldnt resist...:$
00,02and has rape face

killerpony7733: well, im glad you're alright, hehe
Hey WallDives! I gotta finish grinding with Lollipop Chainsaw before I start with LA Noire :D
tap tap
This is f***king scary. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVLmC8Motfg&feature=relmfu
Dem Xboxes are crap :P
FairysHuff: good choice, Borderlands is a fun game!
Well, he's the owner of the car. :P
Sylandest: Me too, it was so god damn shocking to have it just say ''BOOM'' that close to you
SuperBrony64: Unless permitted, don't post link during stream
MadSurge are you still hearing Twilight every time the girl talkes :) ?
MadSurge: Yus. It's just hard finding people to play with ~_~ And I get bored playing it solo.
Lil_B: It's impossible to unhear :D
Don't remind me. :P
00,02buy a pig for $3.20
Lil_B: Not really, because Twilight wouldn't say those things :D
FairysHuff: I would play with ya if i had borderlands at all
Ohhhhh
so it's pig's blood
lol had no idea I was still connected on my iPod
maybe
MadSurge: So if I don't find anyone I'll just uninstall it again rather than play solo
killerpony7733: It's really cheap now.
Only realized when I turned on the screen on my way to bed :(
MadSurge there needs to be an episode where she has to say those thing XD
Well it COULD be something. :P
FairysHuff: Well i got some money today but i can't get it on my mastercard sadly :|
Lil_B: Tara still had a ton of fun recording her lines, you can tell :D
00,02AgentKalim, if only it wasnt 1914
killerpony7733: Actually nevermind. Steam is overcharging for the Borderlands pack. £20
00,02we could test that
00,02then again
00,02who'd beet a pig over the head with a pipe
Lil_B: Did you play Lollipop Chainsaw?
Beats me
00,02and how does that generate soo much blood
Well
it could be a combination of someone's blood and pig's blood
nope, only saw a playthrough to the viking boss on Video games Awesome
AgentKalim: Smart killer?
Or if it was a large pig, it could be a lot of blood
Lil_B: you mean Wrek :D
I wonder...
MadSurge did Wrek play it on the Stream?
Lil_B: nooope
Nope
Has there been any showings of the TMNT heroes trilogy? XD
Phase4: i have request
MadSurge then whats the connection to Wrek XD
00,02oh come on
00,02i didnt want to acuse the guy
00,02JRP2234[Web], k
Lil_B: Wrek is clearly a zombie viking metalhead :D
Seems legit
I hope I can stay up for the movie night tonight. ~_~ Really want to watch both those films.

WHOA

im going to zip my pants up
DAT SIDEGLANCE
DAMNIT
Them shifty eyes
I hate analyzing characters...
FairysHuff: This is the first movie night in some time that I'll be able to attend. Don't have to work for once
Vordox the guy seemed pretty truthful mostly
So do ALL the characters make Liarjack faces when they're lying? :P
killerpony7733: There 2 occasions I notice a change in persona
00,02the guy seemed truthfull
Phase4 only saw on of them :P
00,02but on the second question he started blinking
Sylandest: Groovy. We can chat together about the movies when the mane chat becomes over crowded and spammy ^_^
Noticed that too, eh Phase.
00,02but nope
nnnnnnope
00,02cause, you know
Lil_B: next bosses are an Acid Rock hippie zombie chick, a black funky zombie pimp, a zombie rocker with a monster motorbike and a giant obese zombie Elvis impersonator :D
00,02thats how people behave
Yeah this is a game trying to be real
FairysHuff: sure thing! :) I'll prolly be in the twilight sparkle theatre room, hehe
But it fails :P
03God dang it
03I got like no sleep last night
Everyone makes Liarjack faces when they lie
just like in real life
03I'd go back to bed but now I'm too awake from making phone calls
Sylandest: I usually go to Fluttershy for obvious reasons but I'll either drop in or pm you
MadSurge i watched all the Bossfights, but I haven't seen the elvis guy yet :/, must see now :)
Gee thanks, tram
AgentKalim: Most people will make sudden changes when lying but it's not impossible to actually mask them
Lil_B: final boss
Dat backwards driving
FairysHuff: hehe, sounds like a plan. :) Can I ask why you go to fluttershy though? out of curiosity
thats smart
Wait, y u backing up? :P
Sylandest: She's my favourite. ^_^ No other reason.
Sylandest: Because Fluttershy is best pony? :P Just saying.
FairysHuff: haha, a good reason indeed. :)
>_>
<_<
Sylandest: ^_^
pinkie is best pony
*cough AJ cough*
Rarity* fix'd
lol, there's one of us for each mane 6 almost XD
Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle are my two favourites. Then AppleJack.
I...I couldent choose
Phase4: for the love of god, man! :D
No seriously, y u driving backwards. :P
The real mystery here is why in heck you're driving backwards.
^^
FairysHuff: Applejack followed by Twilight for me, then by Fluttershy, hehe
Well you know it's like with children guys
12why
even if you want to love them all equally, there will be favourites.

Sylandest: Yus. I love them both ^_^
Haha, that's cool
Fuyguys are guys that shoot your hat off :D

Sylandest: Same here. Hence the zip up hoodies. Display when you want to.
That's pretty good. :P
00,02NO ONE SHOOTS MY HAT AND GETS AWAY WITH IT
And yeah, zip-up hoodies are pretty handy.

AgentKalim: Buy online
Oy Phase4 you played Dune 1 by any chance? :P
I mean any local shops that sell online. :P I ain't paying out my ass in postage. :P
AgentKalim: Aaaah
AgentKalim: Sadly i think most MLP FIM shirt sellers are based online
My only pony related shirts are two PONY.MOV shirts
That'd be fine.... if there were any online stores selling pony shirts over here. :P
00,02NO ONE
AgentKalim: Where are you?

03<bluesun> Oh no... my body is all sticky from sweat now...
03<bluesun> It is summer.. I shouldn't have done this after all...
03<bluesun> Hey.. you should remove your shirt too...
03<bluesun> There's nothing to be embarrassed about.. after all, we're both boys... right?
03I had to LOL

13so when they were all dead I was left with this box which was suddenly filled with coloured pencils for some reason
03Soital, cue Angel Beats? :P
/me is now dancing spastically to the music
13so I threw the box in anger and ran behind a kitchen counter and threw a chair at him
12Pfft I was there before such an anime
12;3
its 10:42 AM for me
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 7Pidgeotto.
/me 's butt hurts
12LOL
lawl
15:42 here
13when that didn't work, I climbed on top of the counter because he had come round the back and had a knife in his hand
16:42 here
just saiyan
13then at that moment I suddenly acknowledged that it was just a dream
13so I basically said "f you" to him and woke myself up
13|D
10:42 here...
/me out of context
12I have never acknowledge I was in a dream until I wake up
13LOL
13ohai Ray
13:D
12I don't think anyway
Suddenly, everyone posts their timezone
Me too QuickThinker
13I very rarely acknowledge that I'm in dreams xD
9:43 A.M
12even if I get stabbed
03inb4 inception
12which was a lot ages ago
12It doesn't hurt
13I remember one time I had a nightmare that I kept telling myself "it's just a dream" and trying to force myself to wake up
Timezones are quite interesting.
12but I don't wake up
I know
12still don't realise I'm in a dream
muahuahuahua
13but I was so convinced it was actually real that nothing was happening |D
03you could always kill yourself in a dream
03XD
hey agent
12I have never died in a dream
come into our secret room
12dying, yes
12not died =P
03I don't think you're supposed to be able to
its 12:45 am
:3
03I've talked to people who said "oh yeah I die all the twime in dreams"
03-w
03but as far as I know it's like in the matrix
03if you die in a dream...
...
12yeah
How can it be over 12am?
YOU WAKE UP
12thats the theory
;D
12well done
wat
12:D
03HML that's why you always wake up BEFORE you die
-_-
I live on island
03but I hate when I have those nightmares where I'm falling for like an hour
Whats a meter?
03before I wake up
03LOL
=o
Woo hoo

:O
QuickThinker: Dual racing game

12Ff the closest I've had to a falling dream is me falling into a huge jungle
13falling dreams are embarrassing to have if someone else happens to be in the same room
Faster Scoot!
12in a dark cave
12somehow
13cuz they see you suddenly spaz out in your bed and wake up
13|D

So are some of the clouds good, or are they all bad?
13falling dreams are annoying LOL
All bad
12I want moar
12I keep getting shot or stabbed
12or its merchandise dreams
13they tend to happen when you're on that border between being awake and asleep
03well
12=w=
Just wait till Rainbow Dash does her Sonic Boom.^^
Even the blue ones?
03I used to fall asleep in class, right
Is it that hard to avoid them?
03and my friend kept poking me awake
12LOL
03saying I was muttering random girl's names
Tigertonic_The_Cat: with a slow computer = Yes
12well

Vordox: Oh, so does Scoot have the advantage?
Sonic Boom is faster now
13I apparently went sleepwalking once when I was little
Tigertonic_The_Cat: Right now they Scoot is leafing with her sonic Boom meter
you were probably muttering my name
i change my nick im apple
13only once though, and I didn't exactly get very far
cus' I'm just that awesome
Compared to spitfire Fire Dash
beatles!
YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME
Once sonic boom is reached.... You all will see

Bon Jovi!
12LOL
13when she saw me stood at the door staring at her
lolwut
you rock. woohoo!
12Apparently I always used to laugh in my dreams
13she told me to go back to bed, and I just sort of grunted at her and did what she told me
Even if Spitfire leads in distance to the goal, the sonic boom will go bucking fast.
