we still have sea ponies...
03we haven't even had TV Guide channel in years
03this is an old VHS
03but hey, that's kinda cool, I'm recording it to DVD
I was planning on going, but I don't have the funding
I have neither the funding, the transport, of at the moment the health...
How many male characters are there in K-On? Only 1, IIRC. Ritsu's brother.
drf is easily amused
I have distance and transport, but couldn't find a job to get money to get there
I'm driving, it takes like 3+ hours to get there from where I am if traffics okay
03well
03I'm weeding out old VHS tapes
MIND=BLOWN
03it's where I stored my entire librairy of recorded tapes
03so I figured, I prolly don't need most
d'aaawwwww . . .
anyone streaming?
If I drove, it would have to be about 8 hours punching about 70 or more cause I'd go at night when I-95 is mainly empty
/me puts on AcousticBrony music
They ruined Sailor Moon as well.
but you hated that special
Wait
Then again, they were planning on ruining Sailor Moon about 20% worse.
:p
Oh, and the tumblr where translation of Japanese commemts in MLP:Fim is found at http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/ some are amazing.

03but it also sucked in that it was the only Pokémon thing made entirely in America
well drf
The Japanese were very startle at the end of Episode 2-- they had been prepping for a season long epic, and, well...
03they actually back-translated it into Japanese XD
mind you, I'm going to take university
derp
I know one of my old roomates acted like that though
where they pull bad drivers off the road and put them through trainint

I remember waking up at 5 to watch sailor moon
Well, habits are hard to break.
somebody ping me please. Don't ask why, I jsut feel like being pinged
Damn, I wanna work on my chapter, but I have a feeling I'll get nightmares....
I think I watched Sailor Moon afterschool on like CN. I don't remember
i wish i knew away to raise volume

gas around here is usually expensive in the city parts, but it relatively cheaper on higways
gas is 3.51 here in Connecticut atm
They actually had to make shit up just to make it more exciting :p
it's 5.60 over where I live at.
here, we complain that gas is 1.33 per litre
hi
It's like that song: ♪It's the end of the world as we know it♪
brb
Sailor Moon is also on my list
<3
oh, dang conversion
...And Hamtaro :p
And pokemon....God, most of us grew up around anime without realizing it.
1 litre is just over 4 gallons
The list of anime I've watched is too long to list on here.
Hamtaro, of course!!!!!!!!!
you have cheap gas compared to us
It's Hamtaro Time..
Ed Edd and Eddy :P
over 200 episodes of Hamtaro that I'll never get to see.
Then at 4:00 and 4:30 it was DragonBall, 5 and 5:30 was DragonBallZ and 60'clock was CartoonCartoon
Unbelievably, the only anime I remember watching before I was about 15 years old was Go Lion.

I should do something about the lack of updates
that my laptop's battery issues

It's going to be fun telling our grandkids "e grew up in probably the worst era, but we got through with a little thing called PONIES!"
You just figured it out?

00,02probably for the worse
Yea, everyone keeps saying that.
00,02'the wilderness' is no where near as dangerous as it used to be
00,02all because of bots, and a lazy solution to bots
I'm tempted to reactivate my Aion account now that it went FTP
hey everypony
00,02OtakuTom, i remember seeing that, never played it though
00,02taking soo long to update
Phase4..play uuh..

lol
00,02must be something to do
00,02though iirc the f2p part was NEVER updated
00,02yeah
I picked up Aion the day it came out. I've heard it's changed quite a bit since I stopped playing and is less grindy than it used to be (it's a Korean MMO, which should tell you how grindy it is if you know anything about Korean MMOs...lol)

00,02Vacation_Wrek, already done
00,02enabled
in controls
also whe nyou configure keys
make sure trigger 1 and 2 are bound to mouse button 1 and 2 respectively
makign switchign weapons easy

00,02which meens i hit once
How about fanning his arm?
00,02time to re-do that again
00,02Dalekkahn, i'm sure that would work

Beats me
00,02and how does that generate soo much blood
Well
it could be a combination of someone's blood and pig's blood
Or if it was a large pig, it could be a lot of blood
