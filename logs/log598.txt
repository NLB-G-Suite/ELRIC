Who built the robot lions?
Swaglions.
Yeah, true, the film is a butt-burning three hours long... but it has plenty of musical intermissions, meaning one could get plenty of chances for a bathroom break. Three hours, yeah; but your bladder can survive it....

Aguirre was a true B Movie. It rode on the humor of us, especially Ghosties.
fluttercry: FIVE THIRTY.
01,11As for as anything new or innovative, there's nothing to take from this movie. But I have to say, it's wonderfully entertaining and asks a lot of challenging questions in its story. It's also well paced, even in the rushed sections, and well acted, and gives a lot to think about if you look past the simple story. And then there's teh action and the music sequences. Both were interesting
1,11and entertaining, and in the second half of the film, they added a lot of suspense as well. This movie had it all, and I mean it had it ALL. If this was the director's dream masterpiece, then I say he succeeded in giving us said masterpiece.

Silverscreen: it was batshit insane but a fun ride
My Minecraft is a jerk. It keeps running out of memory and crashing.
/me applauds the movie
Because Aya's mom and dad had themselves started a tournament years ago, and had tortured Natume's mother and cut her throat, making her permanently mute.
Apparently this director spent almost ten years trying to get this made... I guess all that time went into adding more AWESOME! xD
Ghosties made Aquirre so epic. "Hot lesbian action" AHAHAHAHAHAHAH

Their cutie mark is blankness... they have the mark.. its just invisible
guns everywhere
twilight_sprinkle: About 15 minutes long and nonsensical?
all of that stuff I just explained to you?
So yeah, that extended ellipsis pretty much encapsulates my thoughts on the matter.
I know one time I had my arm back to throw the ball, it dropped out my hand and plopped on the ground. My friend was literally on the floor laughing
I needed this pony break
and i guess this marks the second MLP I will have seen
Oh i come back from the kitchen and PONIES ARE ON! YESH!!!!!!!
THAT'S THE LAST EPISODE. THE ENTIRETY OF IT.

I would totally support Schindler's List. Up to mods if they'd let it, though.
hard boiled? Clearly I should vote for Kamen Rider W: A to Z the Gaia Memories of Fate
I wonder what would happen if Zecora accidentally ended a sentece with the word "Orange" by mistake... 6_9
There's still Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle, Kung Pao

He's not here, though.
Soul: i was wondering what hers was for too
CASSHERN!
Zecora cause shes horse-related
Colgate must lose a lot of business to her because of that.
dat quick fix-up
star apples
Zecora is my favorite reccuring character
|Maybe because zebra's are close enough to horses they can get them too?
05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah, as much as I love that film, it would start one hell of a shit storm
CASHEW?
MEdic!
if we can sit through Band of Brothers we can sit through Schindler's List

orrr
ding sparkkle sparkle
KILL CASHEW, EAT CASHEW
whoever's doing the woahs is spot on tonight
Oh, how I wish dentristry was so easy here...
I'm sticking with Big Fish for A.
For Zercora's case I thought it was only a tatoo
that mark is tattoo used in her tribe
11,01Good se...nevermind.
fluttercry same with downfall ....
wink-wink
I'm sticking with Chronicle for A movie.
Nittany_Discord wut?

I do want more of Zecora
Zecora is not attracted to plot it seems

I really love her character

Rooster Viagra! BWAHAHAHA! :D
Zecora is cool
came out in February
Rooster gets all the chicks
until a second Zebra is shown, Zecora's mark's meaning is unknown.
zecora has quite da ass
if you know what I mean
I do hope Meanwhile's B movie gets shown at some point
^^
I can already seen the Apple Bloom and Story of the Blanks spam with Big Fish
otakon: *shrugs shoulders* I don't get it either.
otakon: do you want the silly answer or the srs one?
TYHe rooster has lost his... Yeah, RIGHT.
CrimsonPhoenix which one, Zecora or Apple Bloom?
fluttercry: and yet it's actually a Horror/Comedy/Musical
Zecora
Chronicle is out on DVD
I could totally see alchem/potion making being Apple Bloom's special talent.

I've been voting Street Fighter for a while, because I want to see that movie.
Zecora
Canadian_Brony, please read a bit up
otakon x DVD
Reikim: which one?
maan, I want more Zecora in my life
0,14wait, which one?
they can't all be winners.
05,15what is Chronical?
Silverscreen can't all be perfect
In my head-canon the marks for Zebras magically appear just like they do for ponies, but they are just more abstract than the marks for ponies is all.
Zecora is underrated. And that is an understatement.
if applebloom has seen the flower in ponyville, why did she need to steal it?
05,15le*
it's like not even 5 lines up
otakon: The hammy one that's famous.
she needs to go pickpocket someone and get an amethysr

Amethyst is a jem
Its Installation 04!
Ponies47: evil aplumepume is evil
Dat flank
a circle
05,15I'm going to go down that river and kick Bison's ass!
It's a simple fact that Zecora hates Oranges. Because she can't ask for them.
Tron Disk?
zecora is best zebra
Girl look at that body
weird how Chronicle didn't rejected by the mods for being to recent.

Tovler: bc it's out on DVD
If the ring was colored gold, it means her talent is being good at playing Sonic
a circle is a pretty suck cutie mark
A ZERO
WRITEity: But...there was a movie for AKIRA. Animated. It was pretty good.
sanic
can I put out a question? Shouldn't all her cutie marks appear on both sides of her body?
lowfn: the question is, who has the other side?

Shooeie I don't feel like defending science today
Princess Tutu...sound sfamiliar...
She's a circus
She's a witch! Burn her!!
my 2 special tallents is eat and sleep
if they appear without applying to the two rules, they are fake
2 useless talents
Special Talent is beign a freak show!
gasp!
Our friend is a freak of nature!!!!
0,14I've heard good things about Princess Tutu
silver spoon and diamond tiara what is there cutie marks for huh?
<3
reverse Swan Lake?
WRITEity: that is one of the oddest ideas for a show I've ever heard. Good but odd.
PLEAGUE
AB - official circus freak!
I'm 10 eps in, and it's pretty neat so far.
cept i guess the hopla can be used to fly
mine would be drawing :P
Ah, another "deeper than it seems" series.
you know whats horrbile about this?
Mine are drinking and failing at WoW when I need to step up. :P\
BEST CAPTION FOR APPLEBLOM RIGHT NOW: BITCH I'M FLAWLESS
AAWWW Dinky
silverspoon is talented at being a brat
Tiara's special talent is being a bitch, I told y'all already.

RAINBOW DASHES CLOUD IS NOW A CIRCLE
XD
Awww.... sleepy dash
Im currently working on To Aru Majustsu no Index/ To Aru Kagaku no Railgun
She maimed RAINCLOUD!!!
this plauge causes the pony in question to be inable to eat, drink, sleep, or even stand still
Why do people hate Spike so much? Sure he isn't the nicest character out of the bunch, but he has a lot of wisdom to share.
uh oh
dat Rainbow Dash
:D
WAHT
oh Spike...
lol
best mane
Spike!
spike bad
the buck did you just type?
Diamond Tiara's special talent is obviously... her ablility to... um... wear a diamond tiara... yeah. That's the ticket... :)
I work at a grocery store... the best part of the day is every time we sell apples and I see Braeburns... I only think of one thing.
here's how the series was pitched to me by a friend: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/328/1196486200150.jpg
and HOW?
And Silverspoon's special talent is....spooning, presumably.
FAKE
Twilight, how cute.
I'm working on Rah Xephon. STILL. But I also picked up Afro Samurai recently, and that's pretty short, so.
I want some pie
man im hungry
so they die of starvation, dehydration, and exhaustion whilst going slowly insane
Pale_Horse maybe it's BEING A BITCH
so spike doenst love rarity for her personality its the mane
0,14I've seen that pic, WRITEity
CriticKitten oh gawd
DocSane: They are preadolecent males. They'll grow up to be very very popular in high school.

05,15Silver Spoon's talent is being a stuck up rich b****

Fluttercry: No, that's Diamond Tiara's talent.

CHARLIEHUMAN! CHARLIEHUMAN!
I may go and read the manga for them after I finish the anime

05,15ninjas with guitars?
Hehe, Higurashi.
Fluttercry: Silver Spoon's talent is obviously spooning.
Ah man
Higurashi is one of my favorite series
http://ponybot.net/pix/2724.jpg
THERES A HUMAN IN THE ROOM!
SCATTER!
Thus why she has a spoon on her flank.
0,14all I needed was for my best friend to tell me about it

Read the visual novels
What is Ditzy's talent?
huh?
Azuredragon LoLz
tap dancer
a human?
0,14and it freaks me out
clop clop clop
uh oh
What if someone's "special talent'' was clopping.... :\
foreshadowing
XD
somoene call Horse MD
I mean her cutie mark is bubbles
Quick_Thinker: leave! quick!!
WRITEity: Congrats, you've pitched an anime to me. (bastard now I have to binge on it.)
I actually think that Diamond is the real bad influence between the two and that Silver Spoon would mellow out and become nicer if she could just be gotten away from DT's poison influence.
Azuredragon: GAH! THAT WORKS!
Lyra: A Human?!
cue "Who's a silly pony" and "Horse, MD"
"kill me"
AppleBloom! Close the door!
0,14yet oddly, I'm somewhat interested in the second series
Xaiden|Okari, you mean like applebloom right now?
Xaiden: You... :D
Shooeie: Blowin bubbles
tap dancing :D
Ah, Higurashi's not all that bad.
WHAT

Horse M.D.
:S:O
0,14deeeerp, forgot the name
KILL MEHZ
YES
Shooeie Derpy's talent is being, well, Derpy.
The anime...annoys me at times.
HIGURASHI?
Megan: later.
otakon: ...Okay this is complicated.
0,14there we go
With Higurashi, VN >> Manga >>>>>>>>>> Anime
wouldn`t this sticks drilled into her head by now?
lol
Okay
guys
WIKI PAGE THEN
seriosuly
:O
huh?
otakon: Higurashi is a horror series. Starts off with this guy moving to a town filled with cute Moe girls, then the Moe girls start violently killing eachother, only for everything to reset to the beginning of the summer.
How do you deep fry coke?
I kinda want to see an episode explain how Ditzy got her cutie mark
give me a wiki page then
How to explain Higurashi without spoilering
murder
how did they get her over there?
dari: Yes. We have a "South."
The power of soap compels you!
Sec
0,14WRITEity got it
later what?
Rinse, repeat for 26 episodes.
Derpy's talent is being baloony, not giving a buck for anything
dat alliteration
oh that luck
convinient
they die simitasuly of stravation, dehydration, and exhaustion
it was under E
Pale_Horse: I completely agree. DT was raised spoiled and i'm guessing SS just tagged along.
all the while slowly going insane from the lack of sleep
01,11I'm going to go to bed.
Spike's talent is being amazing.
mishia: hhahahah hoo heheh
How contrived... i mean... Convienient Twilight. :F
0,14there's question arcs and answer arcs
Then, season 2 apparently explains WHY that shit keeps happening.

Gangsta Bloom
fluttercry: YUUUUUUUUUUUP!
Applebloom is APY!
She talks french in Equestria?
and do you kids know what the smallpox does?
SPY!
dat fanceh
TV Tropes taught me to write well and introduced me to both ponies and TTGL and FLCL. TV Tropes wins.
GabeMoist: it is. It's terrible. The writing's hackneyed, the arts is ATROCIOUS, and the Anime's 100 times better.
FANCEH SHE`S SOEAKIN` FANCEH!!!!!!!
HOLY SHIT FANCY TALK!!!!
HMMM???
toot sweet!
00,03Funfact: Je suis parler francais 
where french's come from in Equestria?
Zecora!
Tout de suite
That apple is a Spy
Zecora. With zee French accent.
what would she say in the frrench dub
dammit Scoot-Scootaloo, I flunked french!
You know. I often wonder just how much finnier this scene would be if Apple Bloom had started speaking in German instead of French. :D
05,15superretroworld he's one of the original mods
Scoot-Scootaloo, that's horrible french
I wonder what did Applebloom say.
SEAPONY
why is the way she said zecora with a french accent
*funnier
oh
OohShiny Maris
WRITEity: Anime is only good in the horror segments. The cutsey segments annoy me. ESPECIALLY what's her name's voice
xD
Scoot_Scootaloo's speaking in fancy!!
WHERE DID THE LIONS COME FROM
That's what her cutie mark SHOULD be, a hammer and nail
shes english
Applebloom is a spy
Scoot-Scootaloo: Omellette du fromage
Here's how youdo it Scoot-Scootaloo
Didn't you read Ditzy's Dismally Derpy Day"?
I play accordion
0,14Rena?
:3 In the French version of this, Does Applebloom still speak in fancy?
Where did the lions come from?
yes
FUCK YOU BUFFER!!!!
OohShiny: Equestria is a mix of all cutures. There are some French Griffons and german mules
fencing
but who is fencing with her?
Applebloom would win all the events at the olympics
SHE`S A WITCH
Rena's voice scratches at my ears when she's normal.
Funfact: Je peux parler français.
ZOOM ZOOM ROBODAH
CURSES THESE TALENTS KIND OF SUCK
WRITEity, I liked the VN better, personally
Ability to speak French AND play the accordion!? :O
i feel bad for applebloom in this episode
she must be a witch! she turned me into a newt! ........i got better.
But when she snaps, man, Rena's VA shines
SPIKE
Shooie: Same thought here.
well that helped
HAHAHA
last time i went to tvtropes, i didn't return for 4 hours
Personally, I think that Derpy's marks aren't bubbles but map co-ordinates, since she's a mailmare. ALWAYS delivers to the right place-- the mail. Which is why she's no good as a weatherpony. What was RD thinking?
Why do people hate Spike so much? Sure he isn't the nicest character out of the bunch, but he has a lot of wisdom to share.
she would do well in the Olympics.
French in Equestria?
TRAMPLE THE WEAK

how can zecora have a cutie mark if shes a zebra?
my zebra sense is tinglin
SUPSPECTED
hazmat
burn her!
I was making a stereotypical joke about French and accordions, actually :P
She does Windows
Yeah. Zecora is just guessing. Right.
enope
It still confuses me that the best VN I've ever played was one made by 4Chan
they'll never do it
because everyone has hazmat suits stored in their homes
However, if Zecora HADN'T had business in town, she would totally have gotten a heads-up from her Zebra Sense. :)
Rika is best moe in that show. Just puttin' that out there without spoilerin' anything.
Sounds legit
But Higurashi Kai had a great soundtrack
vinnyt9078 is now online on steam guys
We need to find a way to get otakon to watch Boku no Pico.
WRITEity: bc they understand VN's better than most?
05,15WRITEity the one with the disabled people?

How is Pinkie Pie not fat?
Pinkie needs no hazmat
MDL: You mean... you DON'T? How do you SLEEP at night?
Applejack, you have an advantage in this.
05,15*cough*
she's the element of honest
I need to find a way to get the mods to stream Michiko to Hatchin
otakon: its not disturbing
good thing her cutie mark isnt a nuke
Jesus KS kicked my legs out from under me.
after all
Shooeie: because Pinkie
fluttercry: ...which path?
superretroworld: So only ponies can have special talents?

Apple Jack, tell the truth

Woah hatception
In Pinkies defense, corn cakes are DELISH.
05,15I did them all eventually
I even took the Emi route
i thought she had a french cutie mark
Just say true things... MY NAME IS APPLEJACK.... IM ORANGE... IM A PONY..... APPLEBLOOM HAS THE CUTIE POX.. then the flower grows

how?
Twilight you so lazy
Ponies47 YES. It keeps me insane when I don't have muffins.
goddamn pedophilia
I used to pick the lock to a storage building behind the public school in my town to warm up when I biked to work in winter! It's the truth! :$
Hi Gurlz!
IMO, the only bad path in KS is Shizne's
It's worth reading just for that
i wish some of my ex-friends would've thought that way.... but nope, one mistake from me and they cast me off D:
AlienWarhead: Um... Objection overruled. Corn Cakes are not made from flour, but from cornmeal.
she said c'lestia not celectia
Applebloom, would you do my homework for me?
otakon: ...never watch an anime called Boku No Pico
EDOCTION
Why do people hate Spike so much? Sure he isn't the nicest character out of the bunch, but he has a lot of wisdom to share.
05,15if you haven't played this, you should
Kencolt nnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooo

I gotta play KS again...Emi's route touched my heartstrings, but I'm curious as to what happened with Hanako...
Delete lesson. Reset

Honesty
yay

tmeout(1200ms)
I knew it
that patience
aesop amnesia, engaged.
Patience is up
The mark on Zecora's flank is consistant with the stripes on her coat. It's almost like it's an inherantly primative form of cutie marks.
WELP I WAITED LONG ENOUGH
hah
nope
WRITEity: but the point is to get him to watch it and see how long it takes
Reikim: Hanako's path is my personal fave
Canadian_Brony: Wow. I gotta admit Coco-Cola is good. What about Pepsi? :P
AJIsAwesome: no one hates him, I know people who don't like Fluttershy
:O

pony1553 if they did already, neither was I. If they didn't, the trilogy will most likely be streamed this summer.
NO! Student council stopped me in my peak
Hey I've taken note that ever since I started fdrawing my penmanship has gotten better. That's good , right?
My steam is xtemetoxicguy
Reikim: except for the whole emotionally distant fear of commitment thing.
If, you want
Except that yeah
im pretty sure everypony here has a steam

Yay, FIMFiction!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4_YYSo_Vk
Maid_Angel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C-Qmzuib5g
wait what? gabes a brony?
yeah. Every time Hisao tries to talk to her about getting her leg checked after the race, or tries to talk to her about her feelings, she kind of just shoves herself onto him to get him to shut up.
proof
Ah
Distraction
Makes more sense now
See, though, this is why I love this VN
http://youtu.be/7yBnl_krN_U
Good morning.
kaboom hahahah ho ho he he
"I really want do know you better as a per-" "TITTIES!"
infernap12 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4_YYSo_Vk
Again, why I love the VN. Not the titties, the fact that they have believable flaws.
wrong link
infernap12: Notch is as well
that's basically half their interactions during that path.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPjFavgKO5I i got it
I thought there was an A moview left :c
Ponies47: what u up to
wow
Until she shoves him away completely.
scottish-geeky: Nothing much
also, something I've noticed about the girls in KS: they all seem to love doing it in front of open windows.
Brony 4 ever
...
I
wouldn't know
Why would you notice that
Shizne, Lilly, Hanako, and Emi all do it at some point.
Anypony picking up the stream later? Anything?
I wonder if there are any bronies here....lol
What does this imply
xtremetoxicguy *raises hoof*
no like, in the h-scenes, they actually have images of them RIGHT in front of open windows.
/me hugs Canadian_Brony
/me was hugged
Hell, in emi's path, it's a PLOT POINT that they were dry humping in front of an open window.
Canadian_Brony: WOW! A brony! /)
xtremetoxicguy /)
*hugs everyone
*yknow
/me thinks everypony here is a Brony /)
00,10yeah richfiles, SuperBrony64 will be picking it up here in a few
Nifty! :)
I dunno, but every time I expected somebody to walk by and just be like "Well what's all this now?" and Hisao and his girl would get frog marched to the principal or something.
I really don't get scarface
that's another thing.
We see like...3 adults at that entire school.
and only 1 is a teacher.
I DON'T KNOW I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT CONDITIONS ARE GOOD FOR SEX
watching "Whose Line". They're acting out a Chinese Action film called "Soma Noodle For You"
hey. what's up guys?
BronyInstrumental the sky
Reikim: generally, sex in front of a window that people can see through isn't comfortable for non-exhibitionists.
Ponies47: u like brony muisc
cause that's not old at all xD
Maybe they figure most of their students are too disabled/emotionally scarred/pure for sex.
Scarface?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZvJRv7y4l0&feature=g-vrec
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhsTmiK7Q2M
RainbowJack: (\ you dont sya
why is Fluttershy dressed like a Aquaknot?
scottish-geeky: What do yeah think I'm listening to? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t38DPnkDjTM&feature=plcp
Say hello to my little friend! *holds twilight gun*
Makes sense for Lilly, seeing as she can't see
Emi probably wouldn't care
hi!
by scarface I mean in batman
Dunno 'bout Shizune
11,02Give me a few min :)
Ponies47: nice choice /)
xtremetoxicguy: o.o
/me is batman
Doing it in front of a window is...weird for Hanako
Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K-I5l58Jxc this is what im lising to
Makin bacon pancakes!
nice
Considering shizne's first H scene involves her tying Hisao to a chair, she probably enjoys the idea
I thought that was Two Face, CrimsonPhoenix :P
I`m listening to Eurobeat Brony-Discord(livingtombstone remix)
Erm
pony1553 /)
/me has entered haters gonna hate mode
Polydunami, there's a villain named scarface in batman
a puppet
...Actually, Shizune would do that, now that I think about it.

Yeah, Two Face.

00,10looks to be 360 version judgeing by on screen prompts
I meant Spitfire
its so bad i invented a new word :3
SuperBrony64 true
it's not that terrible
this is not worthy of being called DUKE NUKEM
360 controller
sure it has no replayability and it's repetitive as hell, but it has some entertaining moments
Buytoast, you mean fan-pandering moments/
?**
richfiles: That game is streamed way to much! :[
It could be PC using 360 controller
i dunno about fan pandering, never played the others
Ponies47: what game is streemed to much
scottish-geeky: Kerbal Space Program
Kerbal
Ponies47: agrred

K to Adults the hell look at the rating
Ponies47: No bribing its unfair to the poor people
In 1992, your phone was tied to the wall with a cord, had a pull out antenna a foot and a half long, or was a brick! :D

Yup
Im gonna buy em all and sell em for some extra money.
derpy_pony: There meh
I like the little plushies. They are tiny, about the size of a Fashion Stlyle pony
hell its so hard im writing a Daring Doo crossover
/me is getting into RIFT
Then buy 10 derpy sized cakes.
no video? :'(
derpy_pony: only thing i can think of is rip their spaghetti hair out and replace it with something else
its a video a music video.
Quick_Thinker: cool , im drawing octavia
actually it is a video just a video of music
I only see a picture
And really... They are only $5, so for that price, tehy are actually impressive. Better than the big plushie
seriously has any pony here beat spelunky and why did my zombie panic source just update?

6_9 Derp.
Herp
Burp
I bought all three sets, as well as all three plushies. I think the spaghetti hair is actually better than the fuzz hair. It's more like slit felt strips, so it lays over flat.

OK... But they ARE cheap. $5 cheap. You can't really expect Hasbro to match the quality of hand made stuff and put it in stores. It would not be economical. It HAS to be cheap to make... Cheap enough to sell in quantitiy

LOL oops forgoy
Buytoast: What happend to the classics :/
like they would say OWWWW or stuff
My SNES is a circuit board with a crescent wrench clamped onto the voltage regulator cause it's missing a heat sink... Not even joking about that! A buddy made a 9 hour no deaths run through Link To the Past on it! :)
i wonder if i could convince my grandma to let me buy her SNES off her
No they only time they talk is when Tom screams in pain that's pretty much it :P
the classics are too violent for our precious little assholes these days
Like baby looney tunes i grew UP with that stuff!!
YEAH
richfiles oh dear, it must get very hot
so now we need LOL XD SO RANDUM to get a quick laugh
Im 20 and i STILL love baby looney tunes
or when tom says somthing like none to believe in
games like this one demonstrate why you shouldn't be stingy with the bgm budget
Oh God Baby Looney Tunes I remeber that show! :D
Not with the wrench clamped to it! :D
Me too, i LOVED lola
I can't remember any show that I grew up with
Wait, the one where they lived with granny?

SuperBrony64: oh :), too bad i missed it
dat Starfox 64 secret boss :3
11,02I streamed it many months ago :3
The sad thing is, even though the graphics r better nowadays, this game is more enjoyable
11,02bronypony: That's the trend silly :3
funny how they used the same movement on the n64 but with better graphics
SNES attached to capture card, or emulator??? :$
11,02SNES
Sweet
bronypony, thus the saying graphics doesn't make a game good
gameplay does
SuperBrony64: r u ganna go after the boss?
bob 64 version is pretty much a remake
the oldest system i currently own is a N64
Dken2021, actually I do believe it was a sequel
i still have my n64 and it still works
Oldest system I own is a 6month old computer. =3
bob go play Killer instinct. do it NAO!
I still have my c64...
i miss my 007 goldeneye for my N64
Istill got my gameboy when I was 6
I love this song
My vote for best game ever is Skies of Arcadia for the dreamcast. No way do graphics make a good game.

slightly * unstable
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jfSX8QExCU&feature=related Only watch this if your manly enough. Dare ya not to cry.
oh
I've got beta for this game too
Wonder if I'll get into Wrek's team
so are those other ppl hes playing with or...
what is this game?
and does any pony have the beta to the War Z thing
i signed up for it
I signed up for War z Too, but haven't gotten any key
Damn that struck part of my stone heart
:(
This is Guns of Icarus beta btw
But I don't shed tears for it is hard for me to do so
this game looks interesting
i heard the beta keys are given out when they are ready near hte end of summer
what do you do on this game...
Hitting things with a hammer repairs it....seems legit
if it works for an engineer, it can work for anyone
[Alpha]: Thats what you do in tf2.. except with a wrench..
I wouldn't know xonsidering I have never played TF2
oh
Wrek well it's beta and teh first try whit a server up :p so it's expected to be unstable
what game is this?
guns of icarus online beta
thx
i have a few keys for it is some one wants it
05i hope they make it more obvious where you are shooting
05id like to see my own projectiles tyvm
:D
if*
Wrek probably in the works
0.o
:O What's this game instead?
hit everything
guns of icarus online beta MadSurge
lol as soon as he saw that girl he ran to the gun
Oh nvm
wow blue is winning already
fireworks everywhere
this game looks interesting now
What's the game?
flying pirates
The music isn't really fitting :D
Oh that's not the game name
Guns of Icarus
flying pirates XD
So, did everyone see the map of Equestria? :3
on equestria daily?
I haven' t
...
AWESOME song :) WOnder what it is! :$
[Alpha]: east of equestria there's a "here be griffons" sign :D
Oh wow :D
Looks pretty cool, dat map! :D
Anypony know what this song is?
land ho?
wait...hydras, cockatrix, griffons, manticorns, does that mean season 3 will have more mythical creatures?
just a thought
Damn chat... It won't scroll...
05this music is more fittign yes?
yup
05i imagine this game goign far
05specially if one could customize ones ship as hell
Wrek, You can change all the guns one the ship
Well... I'm back. Stupid chat 6_9
I guess I'll ask again... What is this awesome song that's playing?
Anypony??? :$

Wrek, What was that epic song! :$
caravan palace suzy i think
hey guys
Chrysalis i was expecting ya you have saint row the third iirc
i do have it
quite a fun game
this song is going on my party mix
what is wrek playin?
Really! I guess it does soind like that style, couldn't tell if 100% I do like Clash! :)
caravan palace suzy
Concesnsus seems to be that it's Caravan Palace
I'm only familliar with the one song Clash, so i'm glad to hear more!
what arre we playing?
And there ya go! :D
my mistake that song was from earlier
I'm switching to my computer seeing as I'm home alone I should start my continued search for party music
Well I suppose I should head to bed now
I'll see yah in a few
What we watching
PuddingCupz: Guns of Icarus beta
man those are some NICE animations on those guns
although... the gun on the right only shoots 1 round, the one on the left shoots 2
both have the same reload
must be a bug
Fighting in the clouds looks cool
game install faster!
Do you ponies know any good party music?
party hard ?
[Alpha] look for the Baloon Party album if youv not heard of it
huh, not both are only firing one
now*
Holy crap it's an hour long
oh no, left is back to 2
most likely a bug
That was fun
05we are an awesome team
05but srs
05its hard to shoot when the guns aer non-aligned xD
yeah, I figured
erm
there is a game called CLOP...
Use your imagination
WTF o.0
and its about a unicorn
Chrysalis the one that is like qwop ?
Hard to stear that ship though
05its like QWOP
05yeah
05also
05can you get another big center gun on the otehr side aswell?
CLOP is easy mode
What is the objective of QWOP?
run to the end
[Alpha] its a 100m sprint
Trying another ship class now
05skype jim? xD
lame
/me slaps [Alpha] around a bit with a large trout
i hear strange music.... BUT I LOVE IT
What did I do :(
Wrek, Jim.Frode.Nilsen
[Alpha]: what didnt you do?
Alright this is the type of harcore stuff I was looking for thanks for the Suggestion for Balloon party album
no problem
tis an awesome brony album
I can dance to this :)
LOVE this song! :)
The party album I meant
This is my ring tone for important stuff that I want to get my attention! :$
LEGASP!!!
It muted!
suddenly stream end
:'(
05gotta restart to get mic to work
*crash* OOPS, MY BAAAAD
Still wondering why I got hit with a trout
Restart epic tune too then! :$
echo cough
^
hey guys
yeah thats some serious echo
Hello alexxm! :$
Didn't get into the match :/
i miss my music so much right now need to download it soon
guns of icarus why you have really ODD starting position
that echo
Good thing I'm intelligent
i have no idea what im doing on this game
any sort of practice mode/
Chrysalis, You could go sandbox mode
Way to use your wrench
hey MadSurge how've ypu been
I can barely hear Wrek in the background :D
Chrysalis, When Wrek finishes his game we should get into a game together
I'll pilot, Wrek shoots stuff and you could be out combat engineer
I prefer my keyboard over ipad keyboard I make less errors in typing out sentences
cool ill play skirmish till then as i have absolutely NO idea what im doing
awesome
OMG THERES HATS XD
and goggles :O
The goggles they do nothing!
XD
Chrysalis, HAT FLYING FORTRESS
I want to play this now :
hear you
but still echo
Holy crap your accent is awsome
That's better Wrek :D
is this game good
You're echoing a bit though
You should swap the wrench for a rubber mallet
much
Yes
For some reason Makkon the little toy shop fits this game o.0
hi everyone :3
No echoy
no echo
No echo Wrek
how you doing Hrafn
not bad, just woke up, you?
right, so wheres this sandbox mode?
after you click skrimish, you click the arrows to swap game mode
ahhh, thanks
I would gladly play this game if you ponies where there
cool, ill go sandbox as engineer then
Wrek, You activate the mod by selecting them with 2, 3, 4
00,10what is dis
guns of icarus online
00,10shame no sound
00,10shoot the air bags =p
Wrek no ammo
Wrek, I'm gonna swap loadouts on the ship to have one of those big guns in front
00,10aye
00,10only you wrek
yup
11,02Night all, see you all in a few hours for Euro BMN :3
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
night SuperBrony64|Zzz
See ya SuperBrony64|Zzz
bye SuperBrony64|Zzz
so is this game good
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Wrek, I'd recommend getting the heavy duty spring loadout, which decreases reload time, but damages the weapon
and then they were dead
since you can repair it
The only reason I asked for party music is simply that my church is letting us pick out the music for the music and I wanted to add brony music
jim also, ill be dedicated engineer so surely weapon damage isnt an issue?
is this team fortress with air ships
yeah
Which map should we choose?
boo
05ok sumi
05halp
05how to sort
05mic is listen to lin 2

Wrek, who needs a mallet when you can use duct tape!
00,02rubber mallet > duct tabe
00,02tape'
damnit chat derped
00,02why tape when you can hit things
rubber mallet with duct tape grip on the handle
weapon of the gods
Indeed.
Can you make a boat with a rubber mallet though?
why hit when you can use telekenetic powers
I have a feeling I missed something my chat derped xD
I wonder if boarding is possible in this game.
ß♀♪♪
http://scottthong.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/twisparhammer40k.jpg
^ :D
^^:D:D
And then the chat died again
Indeed...
http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1005_131964104394.gif the power of derp compels you!
Wow
I was afk for 2 minutes
And only 4 new messages :S
tis a slow night/morning
Say, is he chatting with anyone?
Sounds like Sum i's on mic as well :S
Holla everypony! :)
Hello GilDash
hello GilDash
Well I'm skyping so....yeah
Wrek: Are you chatting some someone? Sounds like Sum i's on the mic with you?:S
Well its six of us skyping
Ooohh, okay
Hai GilDash :)
/me pokes chat to see if its alive
so quiet
/me pokes d3rb back with a stick.
/me pokes gildash with a wet trout
/me bursts into flames
ok chat is alive...ish
d3rb: In a very broad perception of that word, yes.
If Phase4 ever gets around to streaming Magicka, I think it would be a good idea to get some voice chat going.
00,02Kandarihu, would be but my mic sucks
how bad could it be? my $10 speacial from dick smith sounds ok.
I'm back, everypony. =_=
hey Phase4, did you ever get any of the Bethesda games working?
hello Spell-of-Gaming
00,02AdamTheDuck, other than morrowind nope
Hello Spell-of-Gaming
00,02new vegas works kinda
I have a sudden craving for noodles AND mushrooms. Whyyyyyyyyyy.
hi everyone
hey Lil_B
Phase4: Kind of? Do elaborate.
I'm back with Pizza
thanks d3rb :)
what is wrek playing?
its not nice to tease Serenity, now i want pizza.
Serenity: Shouldn't you be saving that monthly money?
wow , this fic has a heck of an interesting theory on the origin of changelings.
Lil_B: Guns of Icarus
AdamTheDuck: Peh, with the firepower I've got, I could probably rob a bank
I don't know if it's pure coincidence or not, but there's an old horror movie in my country named "The Changeling"
what is it about?
axactly
exactly
Funny thing is, two of the animation studios for MLP: FiM are on the Philippines
Really? That's pretty cool
Sweet
what's this game?
And the Philippines is where the movie came from
Though it is probably just a coincidence
Guns of Icarus
Multiplayer?
Yes
yes
Is this free to play btw?
Wrek and Sumica?
but it's a closed beta
nope
nah
its realtively cheap though
Commander_Shepard: Sounds like it, but apparently not
Does this game even have any relation with the greek myth "Icarus"?
Spell-of-Gaming: DUH, the title
I remember it being a greek myth
I think phase is playing aswell
yes he is
I mean gameplay. =_=
One more time you do something like that, I'll kill you.
Guns of people who are going too high, I guess
...?
Of course you will *Holds up rocket launcher and quantum body armour*
Bitch please.
I have magic spells.
So acording to this , Changelings were once the Flutterponies , driven underground when fluttervalley went volcanic and , as their numbers dwindled and food became scarce , "saved" by discord by turning them into emotivores. Joke's on them cause now that they look like monsters , while they feed on love , hate is poisonous to them , and looking like they do .......
discuss
That sounds really cool actually
Bitch please, I have duct tape Spell-of-Gaming
what are the flutterponies?
Phase4 is saying that he has a bad mic.
Flutterponies were in G1 ? , they defeated the Smooze
TrixieMuffins, that Is a good theory
Flutterponies were in G3, not G1.
my bad
Yup. They stopped the Smooze.
Now that was a fun game
Spell-of-Gaming, no. They were G1
interesting theory though TrixieMuffins
oh that's where they got the smooze stuff I thought they made that up
The ones in G3 were the Breezies
And now, time for phwee dee
A voice synthnizer can beat Justin Bieber's ass any day. :3
^
:D
well if you'd like to read it "Mirror's Image" is the fic , premise is : Twilight is a changeling , heir to the hive , its not bad , around 10 chapters so far
00,02that game needs srs work
00,02but its looking good so far
Whoa what is Wrek making?
didnt it come out in 2010?
After reading the warning for Scootaloo's Love for Pain... I don't think I want to read it anymore...
My guess something awesome
Gotta go now guys, might be back later
Bye MegaMoonShine
Damn so much buffer
AdamTheDuck: Here's a guess, does it contain sexual content? :P
catcha mega... gone
00,02and then quantum conundrum crashed o_O
Spell-of-Gaming: Hurting the fuck out of people, Pedophilia, and Shit.
I really liked that Blender song.
fun for the whole family
AdamTheDuck: And people tell us we're crazy.
TrixieMuffin I read that one. It was good but I did not like they it turned out >.>
Who was the pony who used reverse psychology to tempt me to this fic?
Whoever you are: http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/134295752327.jpg
*sigh* you read it ? Really? And it was not me
No I read the warning [Alpha]... And stopped at that...

the brain melting ? :d
^
Make a ball :D
[Alpha]: ^
nah not stupid enough
not stupid enough?
wut
Lol
How to make stuff: 1. Draw a circle. 2. Fill out the details
Except if you're playing Minecraft
Then it's: 1. Make a cube. 2. Fill out the details
Omg :D
I actaully have developed sketchihng the foreground before adding the detals
Jim: Draw a circle, then draw more circles, MORE CIRCLES, then fill in the details, and you're done
Needs 20% more circles
And Serenity appears.
I've been here a while
lurk lurk
I'm sure.

LOL!! Jim :D
I get it :D
I hope it's not real
inb4 yes guy from simpsons
Because or else it would be really fucked up
Jim: Oh God if that was real...
Knowing EA, they probably have enough fuckwits in their community to actually follow that
^
I mean, did you lot read that Runescape thread years ago
"Is it true there's gonna be a 3h weapon?"
08,01>.>
08,01<.<

What does the "Facebooking while Rome burns" mean?
[Alpha]: yeah that too
What do you think?
I have not a clue
I am blank
It refers to an article techcrunch posted, I think
I think it means the world could be falling apart but they will still be on facebook
Lol, I was thinking about Wrek's Brome being destroyed in 30 seconds when he spent 30 minutes building it
Harsh AdamTheDuck, harsh.
it's about the guys who poste: "woah my house burns. i'm still in. lol"
Some people ey

If you say you were playing CoD I will shank you.
Jim, you are correct
I bought Modern Warfare 3 Prestiged once thenit was dead to me but no I played all classes of games and acquired 20000 gamerscore
Oh Yahtzee, how I love thee humor.
You still played CoD, shanking time.
Yahtzee is hilarious

But you are not Pinkie Pie
You don't say.
ehh No point in speaking to you
;D
Oh lawd that would be epic http://i.imgur.com/yTA4n.jpg
Amnesia <3
Scary games are a walk in the park for me
ffs, i have to buy new speakers
So I didn't get to see the end of Scott Pilgrim. Was it as good in the end as it was for the rest of the movie?
With the most advanced virtual reality headset? That would be fucking scary
Braviary, eeyup
excpeted i dont find the game scary
^
05this will work :D
btw Alpha cod is a terrbile game, so dont feel on my side
I've taken not you PC gamers think you ar ehigh and mighty. May I ask why?
note
fancy schmancy
LOL.
Im not high and mighty, i just simply have a better system to play my games on that dosnet get hack3d or red ringed
Must I explain again? http://derpy.me/swaOx
dis gun b gewd.
:3
lol
i don't actually care where i play my game. Pc games are sometimes more refined, but holding a controller in your hand is just... i don't know... cooler?
That explains little except that you are arrogant
pc gamers need to justify their expensive systems [Alpha]
^
You can't pony on a consile
/me pokes Chrysalis
Jim /)
console*
(\
Well I do give you pc gamers the satisfaction of awesome modding
d3rb: meh. i have my pc and i let my brothers buy my consoles
[Alpha]: There are a few reasons... But I cbf making a counter argument xD
Why PC is better: There will be no pony games for consoles (as far as i know...)
cant we all just get along, have a pc and a console!
Tell me one thing your xbox can do that my pc cant
RROD. HAHAHA
play MW3 well
play gt5
diddutz: no some pony games will be out for WiiU as far as i know
i can do that
[Alpha]: But I will say this. Fluttershy dragon mod for SKYRIM!
and mw3 is a shit game
Oh shush
mfw you say GT5 for Xbox. wat.
im talking ps3
We're talking Xbox.
I have a PS3
chat is now ps3 discusion!
Really tell me one thing that your ps3 or xbox can do that my pc cant?
Thrackerzod, Get a Red Ring of Death
Eli: official Hasbro games?
/me licks Phase4
Jim bingo
A PC does not have Marvel vs capcom3, bayonetta, naruto games, and a tons of other titles
Love you Jim.
yes it dose
3DS max?
Alright if you are gonna go there let me start. I never stated that I thought the console could do or does just as much as a PC where you pulled that out I have no Idea but at this point it says you want to start a discussion or argument. I simply asked a question that I want a straightforward answer to.
Jim, overclock the shit out of the pc, = pc rrod, next
if it dosent it will be made into it
diddutz: not sure. but i think Fighting is magic will be on WiiU
00,02Bronysith, o///o
HIYA everypony
Hello!
hello Bronysith
Hi sith
hi Bronysith
hola Bronysith
Background pony is awesome.
I just wish chapters were longer
http://i.imgur.com/9XKx3.jpg
/me glomps into Jim
/me hugs Bronysith
[Alpha]: Alright, firstly digital games are a lot cheaper than buying a solid copy and stuff... Some games include mods on PC... Some people prefer a mouse over those horrid joysticks... Pc's can be updated while consoles have release a new model...
AdamTheDuck, let the pesant think he has some power, because you know xbox games where all wrought on a linx scrpit
on a pc
lol
wrought
linx
05atleast now you can see its becoming a pistol...
scrpit
05so far so good
My eyes bleed.
Wrek its all fun and games till polygons
well more than about 30
Well that didn't anwer my question. I already knew all of that
what was the question again [Alpha] ?
[Alpha]: Oh that's right, you want to know why we think we're all high and mighty, not why Pc's are better than consoles >.<
Cause I have muffins and you don't.
/me licks Wrek
Sup guys
Hello pony1553
hello pony1553
hi pony1553
I can see your point in all this but you goot distracted there
oh man
these user reviews
this is some comedy gold
reviews of?
Metroid Prime
Who? Where?
some guy gave it a 0/10 becuase halo was better
I will shank him.
lol
.-.
Halo is full campers
pony1553: It's not camping, it's tactical positioning
Halo is full of children.
Well it seems to me I did my own research. You no longer need to answer my question, but I'll be fine being called a "peasant" for playing a console my whole life ever since I was 5
lets see what other people have to say about other games
someone give me something
Buytoast: ArmA?
05oh well
05time to play something
Wrek: are you prepared?
ArmA II?
Honestly in review for video games there is a lot of morons out there
ooh incoming game
Chrysalis: You missed all the fun.
oh?
Incoming Tactical Game!!
what have i missed
WHO ELSE is getting dark souls pc edition?
<-- I am
Can't wait :3
some guy didn't like ArmA because he couldn't get past the training segment
I want it so yeah
im going to role pyromancer
or knight
so he gave it a 0/10
i think he may be trolling or very very stupid Buytoast
or both
another one gave it 0/10 because it was too hard
Not sure if trolling, or very very stupid
wat?
ughhhhhhhhhhhh
*facehoof*
they should play some nes games if they wanna see hard
why do people complain about difficulty? THATS THE FUN IN THE GAME
uuuh, Age of Mythology?
idk
0/10 becuase the AI people insulted him
Jim: are you prepared for dark souls?
that's a new one
Bronysith, I don't know
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/36idb0/ for you Buytoast and those reviewers
Jim: yes yes you are
o-o
Oh, is Wrek ready to piss off Caeser
garbage meme crap, they probably eat it up
lets see
what game is that?
any other games?
Buytoast: Lol this is why I play ArmA, to laugh at those who can't.
It looks familar
This game remindds me of Stronghold
I wish I had a better GPU
is that age of empires?
I feel hated
It is not AoE
I have this game but forgoten the name
I can piss arma, Proccessor wise and RAM wise
I would recognize that, but I do not recognize this
But my GPU has only got 396 mb
oh man, i wonder what people have to say about psychonauts
396? what an odd number
It's an Intel GMA x4500
o_O
Unfortunately, Integrated
laptop i assume?
Yep
lollaptop
Do you really think El shitbox would have a card like that?
/me hugs Serenity
El shitbox has got a Radeon HD 2400 which has 256 Mb
Slightly crapper than the GMA x4500
I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M
3/10 for psychonauts because it's an overhyped platformer that people only like because they hopped on the bandwagon
It may be dedicated, but it HATES shadows
I have whatever ATI rexently shit out
this is spectacular
I presume a 6000 series ATI
Mine's an ATI 2000 series
7000 is latest ati series
what's this now?
My step brother has a freaking 4gb GPU
Which card Serenity?
It's a Nvidea
590 or 690?
I can't remember the model number
or an older one?
Bollocks
Think mine is 1536 Mb
I have 16gb or ram, and a 4 core processor, with the most recent ati, i have to check the name
It's the Nvidia Geforce GTX 690
Richy rich..
I can presume
Thrackerzod, nice
It's top of the list
im not rich i buildt it for 400$
My laptop has 4gb
El shitbox has 512 mb :3
Not talking to you Thrackerzod
Okay I now understand why pc gaming is better. Sorry if I cause trouble earlier snd I might still get a controller for the PC as I am used to that.
oh
and
Talking to Serenity about his brother and his 690.
really easy to build a beast comp for cheap these days, especially if your in the U.S
d3rb yup
Yeah, as you guessed, my step brother is one rich bastard
spare parts are easy to get
Because he works at professional photography and 3d modelling, he earns a fare share of cash
That'd explain that.
Something I need to do as well supe up this computer
and leaps in speed has slowed down so my 3 year old pc which was high end at the time still works very nicely
piff i earn $14 per hour
im poor XD
but i still have a god pc
I used to earn 4 dollars an hour
'god' pc. huehuehue
I'd rather not.
so low
I'm fine
jim, but everything is cheaper in the us so it balances out
true
[Alpha]: holy... In Austrlia the average for a teenager is $9-$10 an hour...
i'm on $19 but australia is so damn expensive thats a garbage wage
Austrlia.
Australia*
;D
:P
so what game is this?
MS Paint.
Caesar III I think
Lol
I have $31 if I work during day time and 41$ if I have night shifts
I got payed in tips I was a bus boy and I later found out that they were supposed to pay me by the hour plus tips. I only got tips
Why is Twilight taking up half the stream?
Staring into your soul.
:P
because pony
[Alpha], Didn't you sign a work agreement before you accepted the job?
could be a doubble screen
AdamTheDuck, Guess the game can't be fullscreened
and the left is a blank screen
No they basically just randomly hired me. I did sign a tax form though
It's always a good idea to sort out wages and such before you actualy start in the job
and make sure that it's written, not vocal
Jim: But the other day Wrek was streaming the game in full
^
AdamTheDuck, Guess he just forgot to change the area the stream views then
I don't work fo rthem anymore so it doesn't matter. I gave them my 2 weeks notice and 2 days later they found a replacemnt
He could like zoom in on it with his stream tool
God Gmod is fun
It is indeed!
/me realizes that his typing sucks
Wanna play online ACS13123|Gmod ?
]/me still a noob to pc gaming so has no clue what is going on
Jim: Sure, aslong as its not TTT, it seems to bug me out completely
Naww Lil' Jim wants a pwaymate. ;D
I wonder if any of you have Stronghold
What's TTT?
hey everypony
Jim: whats your Steam ID?
I have Stronghold, good game to play.

I need to save for a new computer ;A;;
/me hugs pinkyspice
I don't even know why I am downloading Cinema 4D when it says it's not ffor novices it is for professionals
[Alpha], jump into the deep end and be a pro
Jmo4267: my computer been fubar since bestbuy "repaired it"
ACS13123|Gmod, You know what, I don't really feel like playing, sorry
lolbestbuy
Burn it with fire.
then burn those ashes
Jmo4267: It used to be able to handle skyrim =_=
Jim: Awww... thats ok, Im just messing around tryin to get some decent screenshots anyway...
Aw.
pinkyspice, format it and start from scratch
I have one small issue though. When I get bored os something it is dead to me
of
Jmo4267: now when I try to play it, just horrible delay in response
d3rb: I did
Seems like BestBuy did something wrong.
oh....wow, what the hell did they do?
d3rb: They had removed the harddrive, i had to format it
What did they 'repair' exactly?
d3rb: I told them to check the harddrive and the disk drive bcause i was worred it was damaged, they just replaced the harddrive and disk drive instead
and the second time the disk drive was fubar and didn't want to read half my disk
took it again with complains
they just replaced the disk and harddrive once more
BestBuy method of repair: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5712/
Oh well I'm going to do what bronies here said to do in Cenima 4d. I'm going to make a ball :P
lol
idunnowhatimdoing
and then I had to go through hell getting the window vista disk to install the operating system
and find all the software this laptop had online
Oh laptop.
it used to recommend skyrim high, now it recommeds medium
and i can't even play it low =_=
did they steal ram from it or something?

Thank you :)
Now I'll never find room mates again XD

Steam is probably the best platform for buying pc games you'll find

I agree

who read my little dashie
hi VioletVanilla
I need a gun to keep myself from harm The poor people are burning in the sun
Never read it myself, but have heard a live reading of it here
really
Worgeral: not a big fanfic ,, only one iv ever read is fallout equestria , and im half way through that
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance I need a gun 'cos all I do is dance
i dont like fallout equestria cuz i dont like fallout
They can dance if they want to
They can leave their friends behind
Jim xD
'cause if your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine
/me does the safety dance
Jim: Dat song
those pop out work
Jim: it wasnt that safe
The creators of the Safety Dance is looked down upon by the TF2 community
someone had made a mlp fim mod for skyrim
Jim: why?
cratorkid, They're called "Men without hats"
Jim: no hats? do they horde them and not wear them? or do they just scrap them? or trade them?
I have no idea but the whole idea of not wearing hats seems silly to me
Jim: i would think they would be praised , if they dont wear the hats then they can trade them away almost freelt
so more hats in the market
...?
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m66jmy2Pxk1qgn4fd.png this was from the TF2 website
causing hat inflation
Jim: oh yeah the band is men without hats
lol:)
What are you talking about?
Damn my stream is not a friend of me today
Men without hats
It constantly refreshes

'Natural' disasters everywhere.

I had one of those ideas which seems like a good idea until you try it
MadSurge: In some sense yes, But this is more alot more individual management, Cause you gotta keep alot of things to be successful
killerpony7733: I see

I played sim city at my friends once, i screwed his game over this tornadoes

Would anyone like to know fun facts?

/me passes out
Back!
Shooeie YOU DON"T SAY
Shooeie, she doesnt raise the stars. they are always there. she only raises the moon to take the place of the sun
she brings the darkness that allows the stars to be seen
"You think you're so good because you raise ONE sun? I have to raise ALL THE OTHERS IN THE UNIVERSE!"
MadSurge the almighty!
I still like the princesses to a 50/50 ratio :)
...?
Did you know that Celetia has abandoment issues beacuse her parents left her alone and made her rise Luna all by herself.
[Alpha]: ohai

Shooeie: A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. "But why?" they asked, as they moved off. "Because," he said, "I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
>_>
My turn: A pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel hanging from his belt. The bartender asks, "What's that for?" The pirate responds, "Aarrr, its driving me nuts".
odd, anyone getting buffers a few seonds?
eeyup
Deadpool is best at being worst......and completely insane....but awesome...and probably related to Pinkie Pie.
Decent company is making it too. Published by Activision though? I lol'd
Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when they lit a fire in the craft it sank. This proves once and for all that you can't have your kayak and heat it, too.

A wizard went to the doctor one day complaining of headaches. "It's because I live in the same room as two of my brothers," he said. "One of them has six goats and the other has four pigs and they all live in the room with us. The smell is terrible.""Well, couldn't you just open the windows?" asked the doctor."Certainly not," he replied, "my bats would fly out." :3
two guys walked into a tunel, the third said: I think we are four, the fifth said: I don't get it

Hax.
excellent
01,11i just got 6 sodas for the price of 3 :3

Hello everypony

Hello lowfn

The morning is a lie.
Good morning bronystate :)
better late than never at least Wrek
Morning!
01,11And really, I don't think they'd attempt to fix it if they DID know. Why ruin a concept that encourges people to attempt to "buy" your products more?
Morning ToxicPeanut
oh wait ,nvm
Touche Silverscreen.
Question is, is there decent soda in the machine?
05one could see it as occasional buy one get one free
05but at RANDUM
01,11Pepsi products, including Mt. Dew, Code Red, and Cherry Coke.
Meh.
01,11er, cherry pepsi
Silverscreen: cherry coke ftw
Cherry Pepsi, I'd like to try that.
Might be at my local pommy shop.
Ah yea...
05you had me at moutnain dew

Mountain dew!
ohai ToxicPeanut
I guess someone did and hai
01,11Bronysith: My family calls it Cherry Choke XD
Cherry coke and pepsi <3
o_O
Cherry Choke..
Choke?
Disturbing
it's pretty much the same thing
Ha cherrychonnga
Silverscreen: it is good stuff. cherry coke, a burger and some chips is probably my fav meal
I hope this chat doesn't get into a coke vs pepsi fight
Coke vs Pepsi, kgo.
05saying it encourages it
Coke
PEPSI IS BETTTER
pepsi
Coke
COKE IS BETTTER
No Coke
DIET DR PEPPER
i prefer both
Shut Up PEPSI
PEPSI IS FOR BABIES (imagine that in Heavys voice)
And it begins.
05screw that, Trocadero wins it all
Jmo4267: I drink both from time to time, Cause idunno both has something about them i like :)
01,11Coke is more flavorful and has Dr. Pepper. Pepsi is healthier and has the Mt. Dew series. So I like both.
Fritz Kola is best
Cream soda FTW
DR. PEPPER
Same killerpony7733.
Dr. Pepper is preffered here
My favourite drink is V though. Tasty.
Root beer.
I was just kidding. You wanna know why? I don't drink soda
Shooeie: dr pepper, some fried shrimp and chips are good stuff
05wouldnt mind to try that cherry Dr pepper they had a while
Im a Pepper, Shes a pepper, Do you want to be a pepper too...
Dken2021: (\
Wrek: i think they still have it
ice cold dr pepper is da bomb
I wish i had some Doctor pepper
I've tried Cherry Dr Pepper before.
01,11Ever mix Root Beer with Cream Soda?
i mean so cold it hurts your hand
It was...different
I quit drinking Soda as of late last year
damn now i wish i has some soda
SODA FOR ALL!
never did, need to though
i dont drink soda, but when i do, i prefer dr pepper
I HAZ SOME HAHAHA
What is this song again?
root beer's also my fav
bungie!
Bungie.
I think you can get Cherry Dr. Pepper if you find a fast food place that has one of those super Coke machine things
01,11alpha one. XD
:D
01,11Vanilla Coke. Now THAT'S the shit.
Oh Yeah bungie is not owned by microsoft anymore
lolvanillacoke
Tasty stuff.
Silverscreen: i remember having vanilla coke and red baron pizza once
Vanilla Cherry Coke
I shall leave, to get me some SODA
I've forgotten what dnL taste like
|You the touch screen ones that have every Coke product in every flavor
Your body needs water.. so drink that shit!
hi everyone
Wait what do you mean one?

01,11The first time I tried Vanilla Coke was during a bowling tournament. My grandma got a cup and shared it with me. :3
ello Thrackerzod
haven't really drank soda in awhile
I've never been bowling.
brb

Dat 8 bit
Although I mainly just drink water and tea these days I think those new Coke machines are pretty cool

lol the xcom sound effects
01,11...whos Idea was it to cross-breed Doom and Duke Nukem?

I drink lots of water. I also drink 1 can of soda a day. occasionally more
sugar soda is my vice
08,01i'm running linux mint in a vm
The majority of what I drink is tea.
and thus Halo was born
Although only a certain of those machines have Mr. Pibb instead of Dr. Pepper
08,01it didn't work properly with sdl, so i'm using vnc
the beverage I prefer more is .... oh god I forgot what I used to get at starbucks :(
It's funny my mother will buy me a meal and get me a large sprite and I'll look at her then she realizes i don't drink soda. I give the soda to my little brother or sister
Mr Pibb is the Coke product, Dr Pepper is pepsi i believe
So much soda talk...
^
eww starbucks
Tea Time.
Well some of the Coke machines have Mr. Pibb, some have Dr. Pepper
NEED MORE SODA
DR PEPPER, steak and chips, my fav meal
/me looks behind him to the 5x6 grid of open 12 packs in his room
sounds good
01,11Chitti would own all those aliens in a heartbeat
08,01Dr. Pepper was originally intended as a laxative
Oh why'd you have to remind me of that movie.
Yes he would :D

Doom mod?

CrimsonPhoenix: Marathon
[Omega]: new vegas is an awesome game
Hey guys, Is there an xpansion pack or something to be able to play New Vegas after you beat the main story?
Marathon?
Silverscreen: i love new vegas
NEW VEGAS>FO3
Yeah lowfn, it's called DLC.
lowfn: Nope but you can mod it to
FO3> New Vegas
Doom marathon?

nope that MS paint
oh
[Omega]: can you mod weapons in 3? how about alternate ammo?
This has a very idsoftware feel though
[Omega]: AM rifle with explosive rounds and silencer
Oh Bronysith, so defensive over your FO:NV :3
Jmo4267: it is an excellent game
What game is this/
I'm yet to dig into it.
In FO3 I was able to play past the main story with the Broken Steel DLC
01,11I actuallh have mods for both games that let me kill children. Why? Because in the gaming world, I can be a sadistic bastard son of satan.
LOL^
Silverscreen: i can kill kids in FO1
/me has never played fallout
Silverscreen: without the mods
Ah silver :3
01,11I know.
Why doesnt Bethesda allow you to kill children?
Silverscreen: i am enjoying fallout 1 actually. pretty aweswome game
01,11lowfn: mainly PR control
Cause people will get butthurt over it
Silverscreen: I can be an asshole, but not for the sake of achievements :D
lowfn: cause they dont want soccer moms to get butthurt
^
Best response ever.
/me remembers Derpy
01,11It annoyed the f*ck out of me when I found out I couldn't fucking kill that advertising kid in Freeside...
true dat
Still if something is unkillable it breaks immersion hard
Silverscreen: ikr?
Damn those soccer moms.....
lol
Silverscreen: also being a bastard in multiplayer is better :D
killerpony7733: yup
advertisement?
01,11Every f*cking time you return to that section: "BUY AT MICK AND RALPH'S"
I don't care much about mods but i thats all you got then you need some more stuff
Mmmmmn
Silverscreen: i want to murder him
01,11Bronysith: I already did.
Silverscreen: do you use the AM rifle?
LOOOObuy at mick and ralphs

How many Tara Strong Voices do you know?
BB Gun4lyf.
01,11I also use my energy rifle on Deathclaws and Legion. Anything else I just whip out the Cowboy Repeater and unload a couple of shells.
Tara Strong did a voice in the game: Batman Arkham City
My cousin`s dog is licking my foot
Silverscreen: i use... AM rifle(silenced),scoped .44 magnum,.45 auto pistol

01,11Lowfn: I know, she was Harley Quinn
She did two characters in Psychonauts :D

Silverscreen: I KNEW IT! I didnt know exactly who she voice acted because I just stared at her name but I WAS SURE IT WAS HARLEY
:)
01,11...
01,11We now need Fanart of Twilight cosplaying Harley Quinn
She was Bubbles in PPG
Harley Sparkle
lowfn: how can you know it if you didnt know it...
Knowception
01,11or Harley cosplaying as Twilight.
*mind=blown*
Shooeie: and Raven in Teen Titans :)
01,11harley would totally be a brony
Twilight as Harleey makes more sense
ACS13123: Because Harley slightly sounded like Twilight Sparkle (the voice)
Harley*
http://e621.net/post/show/175333 Harley Twilight
but Twilight is a prostitute
Raven and Twilight would totally get along
facehoof
harleey...twilight....twileey....IT ALL MAKES SENSE
01,11Jim, careful with e621 links. That's pretty much a porn site...
RE
OH ME GEE

Silverscreen: My thoughts exactly
Really? I just googled it
Jim: *FACEHOOF*
AND I CLICKED ON IT :'(
Could of been worst.

01,11Yes. e621 is a popular furry porn site. Don't link to there. Ever.

MadSurge: It's generally the rules not to link to a mature site
Silverscreen: try out FO1 some time, it is good
Please tell me Jim 's link didnt just flood me with viruses
killerpony7733: thought so
:P
It's also a rule to praise the Muffin.
01,11It's interesting how my gaming preferences changed over the past few years. I used to be a big Nintendo person. Then Bioshock drew me in because of the horror genre, and because of that I got into story-driven FPS games. That's how I got into playing New Vegas, and because Skyrim's gameplay is the same, I got into that one as well...
if its a SWF Pony picture on e621 you may find it on twentypercentcooler, it's by the same people
Silverscreen: except new vegas is much better than skyrim ... to me taht is
Silverscreen: You have decent taste.
ACS13123: but this game isn't all brown :D
wow
YAY DOOM!!!
>_>
sonicrainboomer259|b: nope, Marathon
MadSurge: I haven't played this or quake so....
01,11BronySith: I don't know, I like how Skyrim gives you the option of using more than basic weapons by including the magical attacks. And it's not all offense either, since you can equip yourself some good shields.
I started with strategy and then 3PS got me into FPS
oh.....YAY MARATHON!!!
Next you know it people will call this Wolfenstein. Then I'll murder that person.
AKIMBO FTW!
Started with adventure games
ACS13123: I just saw an LP of Quake, all levels are very brown :D
this is obviously Noas Arc 3D
you sure this isn't noah's ark adventure?
Jmo4267: Is this wolfenstein?
Finally found a Tara Strong reference
I`m terrible at fps
LAT'S WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM IN 47 MINUTES!!!
I hate you Fl00tersh41.
01,11The first console I ever played was Sega's Kid-friendly system called the Pico...
Silverscreen: yea..i like skyrim, i just feel like new vegas is better, i love the wasteland environment
Lil_B: :D you're a champion
oh right my first game was Zack McCracken
Jmo4267: you mean... this ISNT wolfenstein? Damn....
MadSurge A Winner is you XD
First 'console' I ever played was the Commodore 64.

Jake: They're basically furry fursuiters, no?
Jake: well... i think its funny when other people wear them so long as they dont take it oo seriously. and as Silverscreen said, no porn. but i probably wouldnt wear one myself
01,11Like, I love those cute Applejack and Rainbow Dash fursuiters we see at almost every brony/furry con. They're well made and actually look like something a company would make.

Silverstick: thought maybe you heard. i was hoping it was true so i could throw a little party
Nittany_Discord: might i please ask,how he died ?
Silverstick: then again though, we should be more hoping that the pansy vampires die instead

Nittany_Discord aww, I'm sorry for your loss, hope you and your family feels better
Wow, those are twin pistols. They sure don't look like guns except when they're being fired.
hiya sonicandmario85
Kandarihu: old tyme graphics
What happened to Nitt?
hai sonicandmario85
Silverstick that contuie to fall from up above
no idea Dark92Enigma he probably just got off for a while is all
Yup. Oh, I see. Those are little scopes.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 something about his brother died and he just found out
seriously i need to keep track of tab fails
Dken2021: :(
And Wrek's playing, right?
ha,the charm of old shooters,to bad we are never going to get the same again
yes Kandarihu
Kandarihu: Back in the day of OpenGL FPS Dooms, you could not "scope" period!
Fun fact : the first FPS has a arcade game from the 70's named "Tank simulator" :)
Moo ^.^
otakon you mean: Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2
Wolfenstein 3D or gtfo.
goddammit yes
wasn't that the one with the tank vectors?
CHANGE YOUR BLOODY NICKS!
sergio: And you still couldn't scope.
Dken2021: indeed
we can't have two damn Dark nicks in here dammit!
10...
otakon: you could just type the names
Afternoon, all...what are we watching?
or tab cycle
allo Reikim
Jmo4267: wolfenstein has like in the 80's,tank simulator is agreed by specialist to be the first true fps of all time,and it only had 1 color :Green
It looks vaguely like Marathon...
9...
which movies?
otakon: CHILL! It's the same with ponibas and I. Are names are so close we get tab fails to :P
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: or you could stop using similar nicks
lul
8....
There should be other colors aside from just "Dark".
Reikim: we are watching "Marathon"
Sweet
pretty sure Wrek is playing
Looks like Marathon 2 though. Smoother. Nicer HUD.
he is
otakon: He is
I figured
7...
NEARLY MOVIE NIIGHT

OMG SCOTT
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The 8-bit Universal logo at the beginning of the film was Edgar Wright's idea; it was then designed by his brother Oscar Wright, the concept designer and storyboard artist on the film. The logo seen in the final film was actually only a first-draft. It was not yet considered finished when test screenings began, but audiences reacted so positively to it that it
1,11was decided that no further work need be done.
Dat STATS
Schocke: the guy just said is
Hey there, Dken2021! Been a while. ^^

01,11Sex Bob-bomb!
04I know Scott Pilgrim gets a lot of flak for being tailor made for hipsters, but whatever
08,01Schocke: how?
10 miles in every direction.
04I like the comic and the film, that's all that matters to me
THE SEX BOB-OMB?! WHAT :O
Hey Kids! Now you can play along with Sex Bob-omb at home! It's easy because they're kinda crappy!

I LIKE THEM
Hey Ghosties!
:|
DONT JUDGE ME
wow... music quality is shit....
Worgeral: mlp episodes are shown after each of the movies
11,02I don't know...I don't like seeing Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim...he's better suited for knocking up high schoolers and being totally oblivious...guess he is suited for this part ><
08,01but srsly, ilove this film
Silverstick more like Sex Bob-Omb , like the Mario Enemie
They kinda suck, its a running joke in the comic
>..<
I've been well, still looking for jobs, uncle is sorta helping
oh
shy never been on brony state
\m/(>..<)\m/
:$
SuperBrony64, That oddly sounds like me, except that I am a high schooler O.O
Its over already?
derp
awww
08,01Schocke: hehehe, i bet there's a good story behind that
:P
I don't like Michael Cera as Scott...he's just TOO awkward. Doesn't properly represent the Scott of the comics, if you ask me. But that's a personal opinion.
6_9
O_O
That's good to hear. Hope that works out for you. :)
DAT FACW.
01,11Lil_B: Exactly...and it's spelled Bob-bomb
08,01CriticKitten: ha! there's no such thing as a "free" Mac laptop!
04Fun fact: The inspiration for the entire character of Scott Pilgrim came from Canadian indie rock band "Plumtree," from the song called "Scott Pilgrim" in the album "Predicts the Future" released in 1997.
Worgeral: welcome:)
AWESOME DAMNIT

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the party where he talks to Ramona for the first time, Scott holds up a very badly drawn picture of Ramona and asks if anyone has seen her. Director Edgar Wrightsaid Scott was originally supposed to hold up a picture of Ramona from the comic book series, but felt the silly drawing Scott holds up was more comedic.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's title, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, comes from the second volume of the graphic novel series. The movie is, however, an adaptation of all six volumes and not that one particular volume. The first book was titled 'Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life' and was the working title of the movie.
:S

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Scott opens the door to receive his package, Michael Cera actually did throw the package over his shoulder into the bin after 30-odd takes (most of which are seen on the "outtakes" of the DVD). However, the signature shown on-screen was a visual effect superimposed onto the paper.
