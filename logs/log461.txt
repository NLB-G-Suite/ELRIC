Chei01
I wouldn't say "rich", I would say "more generous" than most fandoms.
I'd say rich.

to me rich is more than 3 digits in the bank XD
I can't recall the last time I saw a fanbase that donates as often as ours, or as much.
:3
*3 digits or more
^
having enough disposable income to buy a $2k plushie means either rich or crazy
do*
I was rich, then I bought a Charger
Not necessarily, derpy.

Man, fuck this heat

I didn't even get winter
This is a motherfucking copout
How is it the 21st century and we STILL don't control weather?
Tellmetellmetellmetellme!
I am sad. EQD didn't even bother reading past my first chapter. It must be really really bad.
/me sighs
00,10I liked it
Well its ok. I redid it and thought it was awesome. They didn't like my pacing and didn't bother going on to the next chapter
I didn't even edit the first part
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid if you want to see the revisions
Its very subtle, but its there.
sorry, wall.
phone call from brother. hangon
Thus is why I find the EQD script somewhat annoying
Rainbow: Wait, do you have a stream? I do not....
/me sips his coffee angrily
nu
if its more than 3 lines for me, it is.

It is kind of surprising. I never really made a fanfic. It was a good experience. Sort of a recourse of English writing
But they are really strict. I mean really really strict on EQD
