I think the bigger issue is that Fluttershy clearly murdered the conductor on duty at the time and threw his body off the train to hide herself. 6_9

and applejack was going to eat it too
the horror!
Noooooooo Rarity whhyyyyy

05,15HOLY SHIT THIS SEASON IS AWESOME
Yes, Rarity, "little".

"All my friends were there! ...oh and Applejack too." That line is rather fitting here.
It's a bottle episode, and a reference to "Murder on the Orient Express".

Why Over the Hedge is an A Movie, it doesn't make sense!
AFTER 4 MONTHS ORDERING IT

Keep it PG.
11,01It's illegal to stream them.
You win NOTHING
but it was fun
Doesn't matter if the lottery is rigged or not, i can find a reason to complain about it everytime
at least someone knows about that weird anime
I did get caught downloading Avatar. I deserved it since it was searching for a NTSC version of the movie.
my team won "most improved" at camp..I died inside a little.
streaming is more of a challenge than downloading

No religion debate.
Actual RT quote on Never Say Never: "As a tour documentary, it's rather uninspired -- but as a 3D glimpse of a building pop culture phenomenon, Never Say Never is undeniably entertaining."
Bill Pullman should run for president for real.
Lets keep people in place in the three biggest metro areas in the nation.

But seriously "3D glimpse of a pop-cultural phenomenon"
it's a MENOS GRANDE!
11,01We've shown The Last Airbender. Didn't get WMCd.
Since we're on the subject of movies...
3D is a piece of shit and always has been.
Has anyone seen ParaNorman?
Why is everything being remade in 3D anyway?
Nittany: I thought that was BEFORE the WMC was introduced??
05,15Wut
I personally find that amusing.
05,15Hitler
05,15wut
11,01Reikim: Because it's 3D. They have to show it on everything.
00,02Nittany_Discord, we showed the rifftrax version iirc

11,01And Metro for W8.
i heard whores
oh goddammit
05,15Are...they going to use it?
00,02yeah, the avatar movie was just bad
Have we streamed Dragonball Evolution yet? That might be WMC'd
CHECKMATE:O
I don't get the Kelsey Grammer joke
It's currently out.

Nature finds a way?
1,11Nittany_Discord: the WMC was made AFTER the Avatar movie was shown, hence it's not on the list yet. :P
More reason to show it again
Step away from the light!
00,02like the star wars holiday specials
:D
00,02just plain bad
05,15Nittany_Discord THEY CAN'T USE METRO ANYMORE! the name apparently belongs to someone else
00,02XAX, benders
11,01So we did WMC The Last Airbender?
Hawt
linear with a strong narrative
NO LEAVE THEM OFF
*In a commerical for it
We didn't, Nittany, but it should have been.
00,02Will_Smith, oh you :P
Avatar, the one with the blue people, was a Smurf slash fanfic.
I hate 3D. 3D's been tried every...30 years? of cinema and it's flopped every time. Now is no different. 3D is a stupid idea until Star Trek Holodecks exist.
11,01fluttercry: Sadly, no.
HA!
An alien! *SHOT*
05,15Will Smith is undeniably the coolest man to ever live on this Earth
1,11No, we DIDN'T WMC Last Airbender because WMC didn't come up until after it was showed.

08,01i can use them all as one pool of storage resource
08,01an d allocate chunks of that for things
Not sure if everyone got quiet coincidentally or just really uncomfortable.
0,14former
..and then I read the actual summary for the story
I just had zero to say on the matter.
0,14dat Yiddish <3
05,15Saxy at least you got SOMETHING. I didn't even attempt something like that
08,01like, say 100 virtual 100GB hard drives on 100 virtual machines

08,01PillowPoni: it's basically that you have a pool of some resource, but the underlying providers of that resource are opaque to the user
or 10000000 floppy disks?
Are they wearing their Redshirt uniforms?
Inb4 people make Satr Fox 64 Katina refs
Star
08,01so it just looks like i have a large pool of available storage, which i can then make into volumes

13mike nails it
Ewoks would be awesome too. But they wouldn't use lasers. They would just conquer us with spears and dropped rocks from gliders. :P
OH boi!
13a punch to the head would knock us unconscious :3
yet it can kill and maim several people easily
That secruity really sucks
Now THAT would be scary.
13no matter how advanced we get

AAWWW, here we go!
Is that... is that the President from BSG?
Derpy was a stripper?
If the object is large enough though, it wouldn't burn up in atmosphere, and would end up striking the surface at significantly above terminal velocity due to not having enough time to slow down entirely.

Hey, it's President Rosalyn!

I was under the impression that most hentai dubs were godawful, that's the second reason I stay away from them.
"TIme to kick some ass...and I'm all out of ASS"
Jeff's got the idea
0,14and that's it
05,15......nothing to do here
11,01Maybe they watch movies with tentacles in them and keep saying "I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going."

00,03Americans hate logic >: (
See I've never heard of...90% of those.

05,15Over 9000 episodes
11,01Rofl
tornados

What's a logic?

MORE DOTS
MERICA

I'm unable to tell the girls apart in Claymore anymore.
EARTH EARTH EARTH
Shoot ALL the missiles!
WHO'S TANK?
I submit Nanoha as well, because it's awesome.
Eh. Bleach ended, and then it carried on. For some reason.
all I know is Clare's gone.
0,14yep
i'm fairly sure re-entry is harder on a hull that a few meisly missles
There WAS an "Atomic Tornado", yes, but later they also made an "Alien Tornado" too.
how'd you find this room?
yeah
Also, a REALLY good manga: Angel Densetsu
11,01Well, you have a 5-episode fight taking I forget how many because fight scenes were drawn out.

No, I was right.
whois
advanced UI you got there
i win
and now we can see the ships?

Has ANYONE here watched Nanoha yet?
Clever Girl
seriously, Angel Densetsu is possibly my favorite manga ever. It constantly battles with Rurouni Kenshin in that respect.
lol Burning Man
00,03EMP! Our electronics are offline!
05,15I seriously didn't watch Bleach for 3 months. Came back. THEY WERE IN THE SAME GODDANG PLACE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE

That was a disturbing analogy.
