La la la la.
I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,11You know...I never, NEVER saw a MST3K movie before...
not really watching for now, because it's such a bad movie, and I'm finishing the gw2 download
Cool
I thought we were just doing -m for IT'S FRIDAY NI-" spam.
13i'm going to vegas now to work on an idea i had when i started today
so that's the name...
Silverscreen: prepare for a TREAT!
00,02i miss the robots from mst3k, kinda disapointing rifftrax cant/doesnt have them
lol, i meant science
Vegas?
Silverscreen: then welcome :)
00,02Silverscreen, your missing out
all th doors
im scared :(
0,14yeah, for next week, Pinkie_Brony. just make sure it can be counted as A or B
lets say it right now... no mods have pick tonight
Silverscreen: and hope your laughing doesn't wake the neighbors
i still love rifftrax
video editing software
IT IS!
0,14Viva Las Vegas?
which movie are we watching?
0,14:3
It's kinda unfair to let one pony choose... why don't you pick 3, then have a quick vote on the 3?
IT IS SPACE MUTINY!
1,11The animation reminds me of that old show on HBO...
wait.....
Haha
FUCK YES
Me Neither Silverscreen I just saw everyone just yell yes and went with it
SPACE MUTINY??!
LOL
Yes! Space Mutiny!
SaxyPretender: Whats A and B mean?
Space Mutiny? Best Episode!
hahaha
SLAB FUCKING BULKHEAD
08,01oh! space mutiny!
Does that mean they're watching Caligula
Lol
Space mutiny!
A movie: B movie:
Funny, despite my love of MST3K fics, I've never actually seen a proper episode of MST3K
13meet the pyro but which cuts to shizu stream stuff :)
05,15Flutter_Shy because it's close to the standard lottery
Machu Pichu.
ahah
XD
not space mutiny
LOL
whats space mutiny?
do they ever say "needs more railings"
05,15inb4 railings
I guess
ugh, this one has been shown already..
Space Mutiny is best Pony
we had it before
it was bad
Space Mutiny is the source of the Railings meme.
I live near stonehenge :)
Time for Railings
We've seen this one befor
Eulshy: doesn't matter, still funny
well that explains a lot
Oh snap :P
i need to go to the bathroom but i dont want to :'(
this show fuck yeah :3
fuck peeing
otakon, not funny, boring
0,14Well, A generally refers to "really good movies" or "high production movies", while B...not so much
Sergio_Scriptor: you'll have 2 minutes to pick if they choose you
wikipedia
meet the pyro, then after the zoom out use SFM to have him walk into a room to watch tv, and it's shizu intro
Eulshy: well then go do something else then
:3
ahaha
Twilight is pleased. :)
YES
so much YES
read all the books!
This came out before Wikipedia, right?
Everyone pick the Lorax as A movie
13nah i'll cut when it goes to his eyes
Maybe you could add your signature over the clip of the Scorch Shot.
If I get B movie, I'll choose "The Room"
what if you get chosen and you dont want to talk...?
SaxyPretender: albeit sometimes a B can Be better than the A :S
anypony know how long this movie ie
is this movie space muinty?
A B-movie is Rocky Horror. If you know that movie you'll get the definition.
Rainbow: OH GOD
SaxyPretender: Oh, okay lol, thanks, sorry for all of the questions
durrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
b-b-b-brazzers
Lol!
OMG A WHALE
If we get picked do we have choices or something?
if I get B I pick "The Postman"
oh hai mike
0,14no problemo
yes yes yes yes yes
Pyroid: You lose your vote
DitzyDoo this was made in the 90's
God damn it my parents need to get a fucking tolerance for noise
13i'm looking through my library now for something suitably shizu like and happy :)
This must happen! :D
Silverscreen TRIVIA: The making of a Nostalgia Critic episode, is pretty much based off the style of MST3K, Both Doug and Rob watch the movie, They both tell the jokes, and Doug writes down the good ones (that's the basic process, there's more into it)
I think I'm going to flip a coin if I get picked.
Who wants a Hayao Miyazaki movie?
foot
I like fruit
froot
I like trains!
froot
what
desertman2: that's fine with me
froots
I like Piue
froit
I LIKE FRUITS
I DO!! !MIYAZAKI!
Pie
i couldnt name a B movie
fruit
/me noms fruit
anypony know how long this movie is
Do you have footage from the Doom 3 playthrough where you killed everything including the NPCs? Because that's pretty happy and Shizu-like.
I liek turtles
XD
Dat IHOP
Bout an hour
OH! The Cat Returns!
I would scream if we get Kung Fu Hustle for B
for B movie.. SHARKTOPUS!
13nah fmle doesn't record

13procaster does
PonyStationVita: 12 hours
that's torture
13but i wasn't using procaster at the time
2 headed shark attack
I'm a filly and what is this?
o shut the fk up
MUTTON!
Sweet_Tea: No Birdemic
I WANT MUTTON!
Summer Wars!
the Cat Returns is an A movie by miyazaki but not well known
BIRDEMIC :D
i want ham now'
no Birdemic? DAMMIT!
Like, soooooo tortured
Soo tortured
MUTTON!
AJ: too soon
Also

13just going to storyboard tonight, i know i'll have tf2 clips in
Summer Wars was epic cool! :)
that movie is so bad its not even funny
yeah i know >_>
13but the doom 3 thing, i'll remember that :3
Sweet_Tea: that would be cool :P
Must play Smile Smile Smile in the background.
DitzyDoo: it is
lol
Seems legit.
/me 08,01shouts out to any BUCK staff who have joined us tonight
Kung Fu Hustle is an A movie
Sweet_Tea: but Dead Alive IS so bad it's good
So tortured it's not even funny? Sounds funny to me...
13smile smile smile isn't really my thing though
breaking the 4th wall
Overdrawn at the memory Bank was also pretty good
DitzyDoo: yes it is
DitzyDoo: Agreed
Eh, that'd look like the Skyrim thing.
Disclaimer: previous promise may contain trace amounts of Untruth. :P
>_>
but then we dont get more MST3K :C
For realz
Boo
Plus the theme as it is is really good.
4 Real
fer real
why does she hate Mike?
13blumchen could be fun since that's over the top happy style
Can't trust the whales.
Shizuka: Giggle at the Ghosties?
I was just thinking of inappropriately happy music.
>_>>_>>_>>_>>_>
Seem Legit.
1,11I just thought of something for us to watch if I win B movie.
13dunno if i'll use pony music
For A movie I really want Life of Brian! :D
I can promise the mods this. If I get the pick for B Movie, you'll have to download it. I can DCC it to you myself, I think.
:[:[:[
ah
Dark92Enigma: <_<
so I say: A: Kung Fu Hustle B: The Cat Returns
You know, to go with the Meet the Pyro motif, really happy music, yeah
0,1499 luftballoons
why does she hate mike?
de rabbith
Mice and men
star wars...
that could work
brb
Silverscreen: what is it?
0,14happy sounding song about nuclear fire
Sweet_Tea: exactly :D
@ names don't get pick since they control lottery
LOL
So when are the choices going to happen
0,14in German to boot
haha
Tell me about the rabbits george
Life of Brian would be good. I've only watched it once
What's a Shizu song...
00,02down feathers
:D
@Silverscreen Which one?
Sweet Down
lol
LOL
ahaha
HAHAH
:D
no one likes you
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
thats what she said
Oh you
It's hard to peg what Shizu listens to
XD
so I say: A: Kung Fu Hustle B: The Cat Returns
heheh Mike
I swear I have never seen this show in my life o-o
Who wants Garbage Pail Kids as a B movie on here?
Tis all over the place.
1,11It's Tank Girl.
13need something relatively fast, so that limits it to my trance collection
music
but.. im liking it! :D
pun?
The Plague Dogs or Watership Down would be great for B movies. They are actually very good though
Silverscreen: EW
I'd like to see The Dark Knight
nobody likes you, mike
Silverscreen: NO
It's so bad, it's funny.
13then it turns into "what will fit with the MTP cues and my signature"
the cat returns wouldnt be an A movie?
:D
Got a BPM in mind?
wrong mike
Mike Down
troll mike
Silverscreen LOL You :D
Yeah I got nothing.
13dunno yet
00,02mike down the public acountant
11,01Tank Girl?
seems legit
woooo
>_>
yay
the powerglove its so bad
YES
wooooooooooooooooooo
11,01Definitely a B movie.
13my library isn't fantastically big, i'm sure i'll find something
Did she say Space Mutiny?
B movie we should have Super Mario Bro's! :D
Space Mutiny.
SPACE MUTINY IS BEST BAD MOVIE
>_>
I havent seen too many Shizu streas sadly.... I always join during the outro :(
space mutiny?
Yes yes YESSSSSSS

/me fires up the old under head projector
SPACE MUTINY

11,01Movie alert. Run for your lives!
Hey everypony!

Mario BRos is best B movie! :$
hie DerpStar
hi derp!
hi DerpStar :)
hai DerpStar
hi DerpStar
00,10I should put the ponies up in stead
The outro, while magnificent, wouldn't really fit the idea...
There ought to be a line between the good B Movies and the bad B Movies that still aren't WMC
take a shot everytime they make a series of buff nicknames
Hallo DerpStar
time to pick movie
hi DerpStar
Maybe something else from the FS OST
whats space mutiny?
What about that sonic the hedgehog movie it should be B
hai DerpStar
Hey pikorar!
Sumica: its fine
Hello DerpStar
hiya DerpStar we're watching MST3K Space Mutiny
Trivia: THIS WAS MADE WITH WINDOWS 7
08,01thelonepony: this film
Still need to buy that game
lol
YAY
LAWL
05,15oh god confusing
1,11Tank Girl. Watch the NC or the MST3K of it, and you'll see why we should watch it.
richfiles: yes, is very bad movie
I SAW PONIES
dem overlayed ponies done't work
When are we going to choose who?
05,15MST3K did Tank Girl?
Sweet otakon I haven't seen this in ages

Silverscreen: I think I missed the NC review of it
Tank girl was a good comic, not so good film
Sorry

13nah deeper i'm already using for the demo reel / outro
PREPARE FOR LAUGHTER!
*Goes to watch ponies*

this is almost like rifftrax, but not as funny yet
GET ON WITH IT!

TheRealVinylScrath_w: well it's on MSTK3 so it's bad :D

TheRealVinylScrath_w: It's this
k
this is not a fair system
Also, do I have to make my requests NOW? Or can I just wait until I get picked. Because I would REALLY rather save my B Movie pick as a surprise for when it gets picked
1,11Sumica: Which Judge Dredd?
Silverscreen I've heard of Tank Girl, i remember very little of it....watched the review, and i cracked up
hai Nerd_Drinklots

11,01Is that ship going backwards?
sounds like a gay porn star
00,103d
BTW, that's the Galactica.
We should watch Norbit
take a shot everytime someone falls over a railing

Battlstar Galactica
MAGNETS
0,14Judge Dredd used to be my B pick
Is too late for requests?

His acting is like Arnold Schwarzennagar in "Batman & Robin"

Actually, that's a bit inverted.
I am cheery I'm just tired of getting kicked
The Dance is called "The Lice"

There's like TEN PEOPLE
My jimmies aren't rustled, I'm just a douche.

Did't she hate him not too long ago?
If the female's dance was sucessful, the male will remove his pants
XylemTube: Yep

And he's married to Doctor Lady.

he looked sexy in that last bit.
Berry Punch just wants more alchol

Funny, I recall people really liking mare-do-well when it was first shown
hi PonyStationVita :)
mare-do-well kind of beats the point to the ground, not horrible, but gets old

Hey PonyStationVita
Hello PonyStationVita
otakon: I found it boring, uninspired, more concerned with making reference than real jokes, and the pacing was shot to hell. Not to mention how it completely fucks with Rarity and Fluttershy's characters.
I like this one for the homages and the alliteration
Season 2 was not bad. It was a weak episode.
dat flute
Demopan
This entire section feels like Samurai Jack.
OohShiny: its "canon"

Anything in which RD is cut down a notch is ok by me.

Ugh

I'm sensing another stupid conversation incoming

Accusing Pinkie of being ridiculous is like accusing water of being wet. :P
and there she goes again
they aren't the paragons or perfection
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=6089251
Sorry, let me rephrase. there were no bad episodes in Season 2, but MMDW was a weak episode.

I'm back, are we still arguing about tortoises and turtles?
XylemTube: Makes me wish I had sweets in the house
How 'bout we take a gander at the inventive animation? That's the reason I like this one.
NNNNNYEH
stop tempting everypony pinkie you make me want to go to my bakery and buy a ckae

How old is the game now?
YAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Crippler: id buty it
Other possibility: this entire episode takes place in Pinkie's head. Case closed.
I just /love/ how PInkie's mane and tail bounce when she walks
Troll Twilight
11,01Smoking bubblrd.
1,11hmm...I wonder if they used coconuts for the clopping of hooves. (inb4 "clopping" joke)
Pinkie going backwards and Twi following like "Ugh"
PLOT
11,01*bubbles
00,105 year birthday
otakon: yes, people can mess up. But those aren't the characters likely to do that. If it had just been they were saving a special cake for a party, maybe. But this is a cake that the Cakes spent MONTHS working on for a national competition.
woot
true
00,10Journey, are you implying that coconuts are migratory?
@Journey: also a Monty Python reference :D
Trollight
Coconuts as clopping noise. Sounds very Monty Python-y
no
Poor Conductor.
It's a reference.
conductor does not give a fucks
it is very monty python
other possibility: rarity and fluttershy in this episode are CHANGELINGS
Nittany_Discord: would you like a rage maid corset?
but does not the Swallow travel abroad in winter?
You know what i love? When shows and novels hide the evidence from the audience so they can seem more clever by "wittily coming to the conclusion" before the readers/watchers can. :|
FlutterMEDIC: wait what reference?
Murder on the Orient Express.
Personally I agree with RAWRity, although not with the same level of vitriol.
DUN DUN DUN
so yeah, no matter how sorry they are, Rarity, RD, and Flutters done fucked up something super important for the Cakes because they couldn't wait a day.
^really
I'm really loving Twilight Holmes here
Pale_Horse: ticks me off to
05,15wait are we talking about how terrible MMDW was?
rum cake?
Its based on Murder on the Mystery Express
Sumica: the tf2 birthday hats just a cone party hat right?
Eyelash
Where everyone did it
not really
11,01Kind of bad that clopping means something bad when clop is the galloping and running sound used in the show.
00,10yeah
Kawaii_icybeauti: have you even SEEN Monty Python and the Holy Grail?
fluttercry: I'm talking about how bad this ep is.
I'm not going to label anything as best or worst ep, but yes, the whole cake-snatching thing didn't make sense.
You all know how "Murder on the Orient Express" ends, yes?
SO MUCH PLOT
11,01Bronysith: But I'm not mad.
pinkie master of the mood swing
Randomnerd: enope
Then I remember I'm watching a cartoon made for little girls and I move on.
1,11Who's Jove?
Nittany_Discord: okay then
FlutterMEDIC: Of course I've heard of it, but I never actaully saw the whole thing.
Zeus
Greek version of Zeus
too much accent
Nittany_Discord: lets give it to otakon
DerpStar except AppleJack
Nittany_Discord, it's a dumb expression made by the community for the simple reason of trying to be unique
Journey: Eve Online?
wait give me what?
A cake.
HES?
AlienWarhead: I meant in the movie not here
otakon: You should read it or watch the film.
HES?!?!?!?
yea
cake
a blue feather!
05,15TBH I disliked most of Season 2. Including the finale :(
it was Cthulu
<_<
So Twilight has commited crimes before
Dat cyan feather
Both are pretty good.
Gustav!
heeerrrppp
11,01otakon: Hates wearing maid outfits.
Twilight, you need the british accent.
ok
like furries are with Yiffing which is retarded as well

Can we not have a best/worst ep/season discussion?
Spazturtle: I can't even pronounce that :l
EVERYPONY LOVES CAKE
But yeah, there are some eps in S2 that make me bored, or I find underwhelming. This and Mare-Do-Well are the only 2 eps that I honestly feel are just BAD because they don't get the characters.
DID DONE DOOD IT! :O
Plase?

05,15Season 3 better be DAMN good
I LOVE YOU FS <3 <3
Fluttershy loves trains
same differance
I'd rather we made meme references than started squabbling over the ponies that drew us together.
boop
fluttercry: as long as it has more consistency
that's another thing. Since when would Fluttershy not only take a bite of the super important cake, but then lie about it AND disguise herself?
RARITY
I like your style rarity
if I wanted consistency, I'd just watch Breaking Bad.
rarity fales eyelashes
yes
Oh noes
FALSE EYELASHES!
rarirty nuuu
BALD BALD
lol
Rule 85 of the internet is a go, btw
xD
AKR was also going have AJ take a bite of the cake, but it got cut out
I think the bigger issue is that Fluttershy clearly murdered the conductor on duty at the time and threw his body off the train to hide herself. 6_9
DEM EYELASH
MY EYYES
Although we have already started squabbling, so instead I humbly ask that we stop squabbling and just agree that ponies are awesome, yay.
Oh and I bit the cake.
who likes my changeling theory?
and applejack was going to eat it too
the horror!
Noooooooo Rarity whhyyyyy
NUTS
A little, ladylike bite.
Pale_Horse: he went in her shed...
wat did applejack when this was going on
JESmith71, AJ DID took a bite
you bitches aint sorry
"little"
The top is still presentable
05,15Speaking of Breaking Bad
"We're sorry"
you just got caught
ITS ALWAYS THE QUIET ONES
1,11Honestly, I thought Pinkie would be one of the ponies to take a bite.
05,15HOLY SHIT THIS SEASON IS AWESOME
Yes, Rarity, "little".
she was just smart enough to do it when Pinkie slept
So did I
hat level up
Journey: So did I?
alfopony: originally Applejack was gonna be involved but they cut that part out
AJ
"All my friends were there! ...oh and Applejack too." That line is rather fitting here.
It's a bottle episode, and a reference to "Murder on the Orient Express".

Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned self control hasn't been invented yet.
Warning: Never let Pinkie describe your foods lest ye want them devoured
Speaking of Applejack, she's not even here
Then what's the next movie?
Scoot-Scootaloo, good correction
dem pinkie bounces
cause I was about to correct that
"Why cant we have both?"
And this could have been avoided if Pinkie hadn't tempted everyone
Desserts ruined? Mash them all together!
MMMMMM
*everybody cheers*

This is you fault to begin with!

And then Pinkie eats the WHOLE DAMN THING
Diabeetus
OH LOOK Cakelestia
I want that cake?

maybe they should pull a *show only I watch* and introduce like 8 more ponies with flaws to avoid ACCEPTABLE character traits.

my A was Good the Bad and The Ugly

oops
05,15So...the horrible things I've heard are true?
MrBen: I feel you.
Oh Celestia Dragon Wars
I voted for Ghost Busters
MrBen: Same.
I got picked once.
I still want to see you guys show Grave of the Fireflies.
I don't really enjoy Over The Hedge since as usual Dreamworks is always trying too hard in their movies
mine were going to be the crow and kung fu hustle
Okay VenHur , Mine were Flags of our Fathers
So, I'm looking at a new dating site :(
Space Jam... shit that sounds fun
Congrats Kandarihu
idk maybe I'll get drunk and drop by, EspyLacopa
Man, RAWRity, that's quite the hate. Even from you. I'm scared now.
otakon, are you getting this? im just testing out my irc because it says my messages arent going out
13Oi, if you want to complain about the lottery, complain to the IRCops, who are responsible for the IRC services that selected our lottery winners tonight.
/me spends his free time mocking other people's poor movie picks.
Sumica: Yes, Lord Slug.
oni_link: yes
congrats Kandarihu
alright, thanks
Shizuka, Chat needs to be put in slowmode
WHERE IS MAKER DUSK?
shit, client lag
"alikewise"... It's supposed to connect you to people who read the same books you do.
SPAM HIM!
Hopefully we'll at least get another meme out of this.
Scoot-Scootaloo: So what, do you just pick a random person in the chat to pick the movie? I accidently threw out an A Movie suggestion because I didn't know what was going on
guys y noy just pick from the list posted a while back?
no seriously. I mock other people's movie picks
ehh back to code
my bad
Just remember, Over the Hedge was a Last minute decision since I couldn't pick Hugo, and I wanted B anyway
I'll complain to whoever I feel like complaining to damnit.
Reikim: D-wars is to movies what A septic tank is to swimming pools.
oni_link, the channel was muted, so no messages would have gone to the channel
has Good Bad and the Ugly ever been picked yet?
I'm shere.
JESmith71: it was random pick
that has plenty of movies
i will actually enjoy next weekend
/me hugs everypony and hands admins cookies
otakon this is all your fault!
imb4 no one leaves the Lottery room
Shizuka: so that would be kabaka, and who wrote the lottery function?
1989 Batman & 1966 Batman for A & B picks.
the whole Hugo thing was stupid. I OWN HUGO ON DVD
Meanwhile: my fault? how is it my fault?
00,10because that list is like a month old
^ LOL :D
/me pokes DerpStar
The_Browncoat: good picks
Hugo...
otakon: I don't know!
I just refuse to leave the lottery room because, heck, I dunno. lawl?
kirzstryfe, oh.. that might explain it but was it like that in the lottery channel too?
The_Browncoat: Ohohoho you tease.
00,03We won't be using this system forever, just so you know :/
I don't think I've seen that one.
13it's still too recent
otakon, you bring badluck to all
its still a list
might as well
Dermathil: ure in IRC o_0\
Scoot-Scootaloo, why not
Never heard of it.
1,11Oh, I see, all this talk of movies and I don't get a damn thing about my singing. ;_; I hate you guys.
I like it
The reason Looney Tunes: Back in Action was picked as my A movie is unlike Space Jam, it actually TRIED to be more faithful to the Looney Tunes cartoons.
oni_link, yep
13that's a film the MAFIAA will be watching torrents for
I know rite
oh
I'm out of here, see you all in regulars and bronystate
IshGirlfriendlesPony: if you loved me you'd have picked the Good the Bad and the Ugly
Meanwhile: won like, 5 academy awards
But it was mod pick
IshGirlfriendlesPony: It's a damn shame that you dind't get B movie
thanks kirz :)
Your singing was lovely Journey.
Silverscreen: Your singing gave me AIDS.
You did awesome Journy :)
Bai otakon
Bye otakon
oops
Journey: I liked the song of your people

It appears da law has been laid
I was already in bronystae

otakon: but theres still a movie

I AM NOT LEAVING THIS CHAT!
And what the fuck is so bad about Dragon Wars?
A Hooffull of bits was picked once
bye!
If you don't mind me asking
Hugo is a Martin Scorcese film, so it's pretty kewl.
I AM NOT LEAVIN!
Journey: It was quite soothing. That gravely gargle of yours.
What movie is next?
Thats my second win for A in the past year
RAWRity: I don't care about the academy or it's awards.
just gonna get some coffee, brb
inb4 otakick
D-War is such a bad movie lol
Otakon, I CAST YOU OUT!!!
I didn't like Hugo all that much. I loved the Artist at least.
Space Jam for my B Movie on the other hand, you all know why. Espectially Lola Bunny...
/me pushes otakon out of chat in wheelchair
http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/2qZF2.gif?1342342738

Hello Journey. Who are you?
Yay! I'm not in BS anymore! :D

Hugo was pretty good, it was kind of meta. Like a movie-lover's movie
Oh muissed the lottery... Derp. Should of been paying attention to chat XD
There's a program to get around the MAFIAA, isn't there?

I hope you liked what I said.

What ScootaChicken said
/me Turns into SUPER SAIYAN
Lol
/leave i need more muffins
And why Dragon Wars is so bad?
sigh,
I loved the name. B.S. Lottery. Very aptly named.
Just rent it on Netflix or Redbox
1,11ScootaChicken pretty much hit the nail on the head.
and what's with the "Too Risky"? Hint: don't download from a torrent with 10,000 seeders. It'll be bugged.
#bslottery is now the mods VIP room
WalkerPony89: not enough time in the day.
why so depresses DoctoDoctorWho

11,01It's basically the RIAA and MPAA combined.

And not because its supposed to stand for brony state, oh no
http://derpy.me/UAvjY GUESS THE REFERENCE TIME
cheers
Ooh, das nasty
05,15They watch for torrents of newer movies
so whats next weeks movies? or have they not been decided yet?
Just guess the reference of that pic and you'll win
Dovah: We have.
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
CrimsonPhoenix: edo?
Dovah: We just did lotto
Dovah I could punch you in the face right now.
I know I have at least one program downloaded back when SOPA was a big thing, specifically to duck under its baleful gaze.
Whos waiting till the GW2 launch tonight?
LOL
People Say the Lotto is rigged regardless of technique /)_-
owloysius, not edo
00,10sorry waht was the question asked in the room? I missed it when Shizuka cleared the chat.
Unless I deleted that.
11,01I have MAFIAAFire installed.
Dovah feeling the love.
Meanwhile: do eet
Over The Hedge and Dragon Wars
Hell, I just Torrented The Avengers and was safe.
I've got an HDD full of torrented movie from the last 2 years. Nothing's come of it so fare.
late again *facehoof*
Meanwhile: well fuck you to ass
Yeah, it might have been that one.
Dragon Wars and Backyard Dovah
Well
da faq is dragon wars?
boy that escalted quickly
or, well Over The Hedge I guess.
Dovah: Good answer. I like you.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: yay answer!
Hai SuperBrony64
I just got Last Story
11,02Hai CrimsonPhoenix ^_^
The other problem is that Bronystate torrents the movies for showing, unless I miss my mark.
Why Over the Hedge is an A Movie, it doesn't make sense!
Kawaii_icybeauti: I would presume a war fough by dragons
/me glomps SuperBrony64
cuz I dont know anyone well enough to do that or the related acts of affection without people thinking Im a creeper:(
Hai SuperBrony64
SuperBrony!
dat SuperBrony64 :3
CrimsonPhoenix: Cromartie reference?
AFTER 4 MONTHS ORDERING IT
Which is technically very illegal.
Dovah: watch the language.
11,01MAFIAAFire gets around copyright ban lists, so it probably was.
Ohi SuperBrony64
Keep it PG.
VenHur: It was a really good movie
Dragon Wars is strange to say the least.
Pudge, congratulation my good sir
11,01It's illegal to stream them.
You win NOTHING
Meanwhile: um good for me?
but it was fun
CrimsonPhoenix: GOOD DAY SIR
Doesn't matter if the lottery is rigged or not, i can find a reason to complain about it everytime
I can see god through Derpy's eyes...
Dermathil: I didnt see the mods complain...
Is there a reason why no one is on TF2 server? Kinda scares me when im on and no one else is |:
at least someone knows about that weird anime
I hate Dreamwork's movies, the only decent ones I like was Shrek 1 and 2, El Dorado, Sprit, Antz, and that's it.
I did get caught downloading Avatar. I deserved it since it was searching for a NTSC version of the movie.
my team won "most improved" at camp..I died inside a little.
streaming is more of a challenge than downloading
So that could possibly put BState at additional risk.
Oh, we're not banned from the Slottery channel
Reikim: yes, but that would be an issue with the stream provider, not the torrent itself.
11,02Dat Spell-of-Gaming O.O
everyone bitches about the lottery
What are we watching? I fell asleep
Oh and Journey I did notice you randomly singing in here during the lotto but I don't know the song
THAT'S. IT.
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho "dont worry, i barely know you or anyone here but i will hug them when they feel down" ^_^
VenHur, How to train a Dragon
my lottery crashed
13thing is we don't have a great many people available to run movie nights
Reikim: and a risk they'd be taking anyway with regular streaming.
CrimsonPhoenix: Haven't watched that one yet.

Moonshadow........moonshadow
OHGOD ITS ROSIE!
this defies the physics of there being wind in space
Okay. I never watched this movie. This is a horribly awkward moment. My mom is watching, and I REALLY don't want to watch it like this before I watch it unriffed.
Sigh. Oh well. Better luck next week.
GIVE HER PIE!
Scoot-Scootaloo GODDAMN IT
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Now I see the theme tonight. Mike and the gang riffing on two sci-fi films
Kandarihu: just watch and laugh
I missed the beginning of the movie last year.
No Boomer Spoilers, we haven't got to that part.
Because incest.
MeanwhileL I think we need to accept that we're both never going to win anything.
big thang
Assume
lol
00,02XD
ScootaChicken: see, THAT'S grey area. Not well recieved on IMDB, but met with middling reception by critics on RT. Decent sized budget of 15 mil. Likely an A, but Beiber hatred made everyone scream B.
Shut up and let me dream you bangkok prostitute.

At the very least, I'd rather watch it normally before I watch it riffed. But my mom watched it before unriffed and enjoyed it.
Rifftrax makes everything better
leeroy jenkins
Heh the ponies down there are doing their best impressions of Mike, Bill, and Kevin's voices

I'd pin Bieber as an A for budget.
When you make assumptions You make an "ass" out of "U" and "mptions". :D
Shizuka: oh okay then
Inderpendence Day 6_9
HA
I LOVE independence day
Seems more like an A too
And by the gods, If I ever win A or B, I'll make my case for either one. I WILL make you fuckers watch that.
how could they possibly rifftrax it
at this point I don't care if mother figures out Imma brony, I have bigger secret to hide from people
these wubs are the sound we're looking for!:D
i hated it
Big, hyped, didn't fail spectacularly...pretty much an A.
I would vote for Beiber as A, but that spot's reserved for Fight Club.
We really need a Mystery Equestrian Theather series, WHOS WITH ME?
she already suspects it anyway
RAWRity: Why do you hate us?
05,15Pudge sometimes they riff things they like
Elvis was a much better actor than Beiber
I'M WITH YOU
VenHur: /)
They can rifftrax anything.
RAWRity: Watch what?
VenHur: i second this
He was in Stargate right?
VenHur: YES

And I don't want to risk putting Fight Club as a B and then having the mods go 'Oh no, it's an A movie, we ain't watching that yo.'
I'm not wasting my first movie ever on Bieber

Luna's betrayed us? ;_;

WalkerPony89: more I just hate the internet's knee-jerk reaction to Bieber, and the transphobis shit they spew everytime he comes up. This way I can at least enjoy people squirm.

Too recent? Hugo came out on DVD in like March
It's funny because Megyn Kelly

Well, I'm off y'all. Enjoy the movie :)
Fight everyone!

05,15I think you overestimate the trolling potential of that.

Tovler: I think it's riskier to get recently released movies then older titles
My teacher made us Watch this and War of the worlds at school. Then compare them.
05,15Most people would just leave
Nittany_Discord: Alright, just making sure :P

Old one DERPDERPDERPDERP
oni_link: Both are great brands, ATI is more affordable.
i came up with in the chat like maybe 100 posts agao
It's pretty clear that the President in this movie is Republican. Because Will Smith's girlfriend voted for the other guy.
Gnomes
RAWRity: That's the thing, they're not really movies, they're tour documentaries built to pander to the fanbase.
Tovler: most likely. But we can always watch Batman and Robin.
The heck with it. This movie isn't very good anyway. So I'm not going to put it ahead of my cats who need feeding or dinner, but I will put it ahead of PSO2.
Meet the Spartans foar A movie
Space Odyssey?
Boom!
XD
hen3ry: Unless she votes republican
ScootaChicken: eh I've always turned it off a few babies in
oni_link: Something like a HD7750 should do you good.
it's not a goddamn A
Reikim: still technically films. It even had a theatrical release. So....
explosive cuts
Does that even have the budget for A IshGirlfriendlesPony?
00,02satellites move a bit faster than that
I just lost my signal.
Actually, play the Bieber movie, just so we can have a quiet chat for once.
it doesn't have the budget or earnings
DerpStar: unlikely, demographically

fluttercry: Never make light of that movie.
Bronystate was almost shut down when they played Inception
fluttercry: I forgot whether that or Spider's Web was Tacowiz's handiwork.
We lost good people during that.
what we watching, independence day?
Sorry, closed the page by accident.
RAWRity: Well on that logic we could stream anything that got released in theatres. I hate the Bieber hatedom just as much as you do, but I still don't think it should be played as a movie.
00,10they also hang 8 km in the air and do loops Phase4

That's the burning smell.
Will_smith Jeff Goldblum playing Jeff Goldblum

00,02Sumica, yeah
1,11Deadlypon3 indeed
made 18 mill in the US
Reikim: technically, if it's a cinematic length film, we could play it.
Jmo: wow, thats actually pretty affordable. i wont be able to play on ultra with that though huh?

05,15Jeff Goldbloom always plays himself
it's not a A

Why are you talking like this!?
otakon: 100 thousand million?
Nittany_Discord: awesome and I missed them? dammit
oni_link: Ultra in games like BF3/Crysis 2/3/ETC you'd require something abit more then that, the 7750 will allow you to play most games on decent settings though.
This guy could use another cigarette.
otakon: we've had A movies from after 2000 with lower budgets.
Riding a bike through your office. Oh the 90's.

My choice has been Fight Club for A, Trainspotting for B for quite a while.

CrimsonPhoenix: yes
ouchy

Every time I highlight DerpStar, I ALMOST highlight DERPDERPDERPDERP
Never used either, so I wouldn't know.
Will_Smith didn't know having a bottlebrush in your throat is a sterotype
Hold on
ehehehe
he started smoking when he was 4.
not sure if good or bad
damn
I agree, Howard The Duck would be Worst Movie Clause'd, just for Duck...you know whats.
Kandarihu: ^^
Food getting time
05,15RT is pretty reliable
The Comebacks?
05,15so is metacritic
I'm more likely to pay attention to regular people than critics.
haah
isn't that the sports parody movie?
DAMN
it's a B I think
Because I'm not a critic, nor do I care.
Kandarihu: It's alright, I'm the guy with the capitals.
1,11Deadlypon3: if you watched enough movies movies in the 90's, you'd get it.
VenHur: you mean Duck T*ts
Meanwhile: but dammit do you criticize...

I had an offical comic prequel of this. It showed that guy getting stripped by the aliens and getting examined by them
1,11VenHur: all the more reason to watch it. :P
good enough
NocturnalBlade: WOOHOO
zero gravity butt fun
Of course they did
so many maid outfits
/me k , got clothes on now
EW EW EW! Don't mention that! I HATES DUCK...YOU KNOW WHATS!
Meanwhile: except with regular people, then you get mob mentality that either praises or destroys a film.
JUST EW!
True.
they all look good dont they Nittany_Discord ?
EW!
1,11and that reminds me, Last Airbender was watched before the WMC was made. I can still suggest that as well...
VenHur: DUCK TITS! WOO HOO!
It's approaching Los Angeles... via the Pacific AND Arizona!
(In a PG-sense of course, since it was an official comic)
00,10lets get out of the RV, it might colapse
AAAH! IT BURRRNS!
Will_Smith: it is a WMC movie
VenHur: WOO HOO!
Will_Smith: Don't you even joke about something like that.
11,01Bronysith: I have that pic.
00,02oh no, not hollywood
DUCK TITS O_o
Why are we speaking about DUCK TITS anyway?
Last Airbender Live Action film WMC as well
WILL SMITH
they're birds.
SirGanjalf: Howard the Duck
00,02who will make movies for rifftrax now
Thus why there's the disparity between RT and IMDB on Never Say Never
GAAAH! STOP IT! JUST EWWW!
Fresh Prince
Will_Smith: If you suggest that you'll become the next Tacowiz.
mom don't give a fuck
Phase4: Shizuka will!
Will Smith. <3
holy crap!
ScootaChicken: who is Tacowiz?
11,01XD
True fact: Accurate California "give no fuck" reaction to mild earthquake
If a movie is WMC'ed do you still show the Euro Movie Night encore before banning it from being shown again?
11,01XD
Four Score and Seven-HOLY CRAP!
13JESmith71: no
will smith as a background guy, was he desperate or what?
XD
NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT
RT gives it's a 64/100 with the critics. IMDB gives it a 1.5/10 because Beiber's an online pariah.
1,11Okay, my next two suggestions for B movie: Howard the Duck and Last Airbender.
11,0264 o.o
*finally stops sleeping* FINALLY, some freaking action. How long has the movie runned for so far?
a sixty four
00,02why do presidents always have daughters in movies
Will_Smith: lolno
00,02never have a son
goddammit
hmmm
Quick everyone get a wooden baseball bat and a super soaker those are the only things that can hurt them
WTC... whoops
The Twin Towers?
otakon: Yeah, but why are we recalling Howard the Duck during Independence Day stream?
Will_Smith: You evil, evil man.
Heh AlienWarhead

why are they looking? THEY NEVER LOOK!!!
SirGanjalf: bc someone brought it up

00,02XD
dat tent city
otakon: Fair enough
Shizuka: dam , i feel old now...
it's a MENOS GRANDE!
Who the hell was that guy!?
Why is the 3D so important?
11,01We've shown The Last Airbender. Didn't get WMCd.
Oh boy, they poked fun at the Lite Bright incedent
Elements of Harmony could have stopped this, just saying
3D is a piece of shit and always has been.
You know what happens with "Regular People" doing anything on the internet? You get Mtn Dew's new green apple flavored soda being named "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong"
Nittany_Discord: it should have
HOLY SHIT its that boss from Katina!
SOME ONE GET STARFOX
Has anyone seen ParaNorman?
Why is everything being remade in 3D anyway?
Nittany: I thought that was BEFORE the WMC was introduced??
Spademagnes[R]: GET ...dammit
05,15Wut
I personally find that amusing.
05,15Hitler
BEWARE EARTHLINGS, I AM TAKING ALL YOUR CHEESE!
1,11"when a couple of aliens who were up to no good, threatened to blast away my whole neighborhood. I got in one little space-fight and my mom got scared she said "you'll save the planet by flying yourself elswhere"
00,10so the cloud dont go away till they stop?
05,15wut
11,01Reikim: Because it's 3D. They have to show it on everything.
00,02Nittany_Discord, we showed the rifftrax version iirc
Spademagnes[R]: DO A BARREL ROLL!
11,01*shove
13Phase4: not yet
Will_Smith: lol
RAWRity: You say that like it's a bad thing
Sadly Ray's was closed.
13i have it but i haven't even been able to watch it all the way through
fluttercry: The public was asked to vote for the name of a new Mountain Dew flavour.
Will_Smith: :D
13it's so bad
lol
Will_Smith: pfftahaha
RAWRity: Obviously he's not talking about on the Internet, he's saying IRL. Unless he's not, in which case, go right ahead.
VenHur: THROW THE CHEESE!
And it's "Hitler did nothing wrong"
11,01It's like how motion controls are being shoved down gamer's throats.
13LONG LIVE AKIRA
Which I am tickled by.
Nittany_Discord: 3d is a stupid fucking gimmic and everyone knows this
11,01And Metro for W8.
i heard whores
oh goddammit
05,15Are...they going to use it?
00,02yeah, the avatar movie was just bad
Have we streamed Dragonball Evolution yet? That might be WMC'd
Shizuka: i worship akoo
00,02not funny bad, bad
CHECKMATE:O
I don't get the Kelsey Grammer joke
It's currently out.
Motion controls RUINED Steel Battalion
Nature finds a way?
1,11Nittany_Discord: the WMC was made AFTER the Avatar movie was shown, hence it's not on the list yet. :P
More reason to show it again
Step away from the light!
:D
Phase4: benders one, or the bluepeople one
What is Metro? Other than the company I work for, of course.
00,02just plain bad
IshGirlfriendlesPony: he's apparently a bad drive
05,15Nittany_Discord THEY CAN'T USE METRO ANYMORE! the name apparently belongs to someone else
00,02XAX, benders
I remember that some TV station that showed Johnny Carson reruns made fun of that scene by having Carson be above the ship and had Leno and Letterman lookalikes staring up in shock
otakon: Looked like a fun game too
00,02bluepeople one was meh with amazing cg
Phase4: yeah, it wasn't great.
11,01So we did WMC The Last Airbender?
Ok, aliens stop over Empire State Building (at that time not the tallest building in NY), and White House (not even close to tallest) - good intel?
Hawt
Get some pants on Will_Smith
Phase4: Animated series > movie. by miles.
linear with a strong narrative
no mp
05,15So it won't be released? I can't go to my 7/11 and get Hitler Did Nothing Wrong?
1,11Smith's so swag, he's got two bitches in his bed every morning.
NO LEAVE THEM OFF
fluttercry: but they're still gonna be using that interface. and it's terrible.
Seriously, what is Metro, aside from the grocery company I work for oh thanks otakon
We didn't, Nittany, but it should have been.
00,02Will_Smith, oh you :P
Avatar, the one with the blue people, was a Smurf slash fanfic.
I hate 3D. 3D's been tried every...30 years? of cinema and it's flopped every time. Now is no different. 3D is a stupid idea until Star Trek Holodecks exist.
Phase4: Although, the scene where five earthbenders danced for 2 minutes to lift a small stone did get a chuckle out of me.
:3 If & when I ever get a movie in, my attemps at a 2nd will aim for a WMC
fluttercry: afraid not. Looks like it's going to be named "Tempest"
11,01fluttercry: Sadly, no.
HA!
Reikim: actually they might be thinking of a different MEtro.... sorry I'm wrong in this case
I'd buy Mountain Dew if it was called Hitler did nothing wrong
An alien! *SHOT*
Will_Smith: If we have a Worst Movie Clause list, maybe we shoud make something I would called a "Bronystate's Hall of Fame" list...y'know, for good movies.
05,15Will Smith is undeniably the coolest man to ever live on this Earth
1,11No, we DIDN'T WMC Last Airbender because WMC didn't come up until after it was showed.
Sorry for that wall of spam.
Didn't seent that comming.
So how many times has Will Smith had fake kids and wives?
Fluttercry right next to the inventor of ponies :p
fluttercry: nope- shuck testa
fluttercry What about Samual L Jackson?
11,01I don't think you could trademark Metro unless you were good at patent trolling.
05,15Deadlypon3 no. He's cooler
11,01Like that Edge magazine guy.
05,15Samuel L. Jackson is a few places lower
boom boom boom
oh shit
Mmm Mountain Dew
Nittany_Discord: this is the Tech industry. Patent trolling is all they do.
05,15Well...something happened and they can't use Metro now
Canada is safe!
buh buh buh buh
AWOOOGA!
I think the last WMC'd movie was Epic Movie
1,11When I first heard Will Smith was going to be a superhero, I was really REALLY hoping he was going to play Green Lantern.
lol
oh no not moscow
Nittany_Discord: Apple just won 1.2 billion dollars for apparently having the patent on rounded black rectangles.
Will_Smith OH GOD THAT WOULD BE PERFEcT
That's kind of mean. Nobody nowadays hates Nazis more than Germans. :(
What
thats right, he was a va in mulan wasnt he
0,14don't think he would've worked as John Stewart
fluttercry: they can't use the NAME. The interface is still shit.
Link please so I can gouge my eyes out.
11,01RAWRity: My goodness.
11,01That's shit.
Will_Smith: You has made minds being blowned.
Nittany_Discord: look up the Apple Vs Samsung case.
Southern Hemisphere is irrelevant
Damn Wine!

Stay the course!
Well, the way I figure it, political discussions are unavoidable here
Spectrum: Didn't think so. He just reminds me of him, though.
05,15yeah yeah I know the interface is still there. But thankfully it's entirely cosmetic. So if you don't upgrade you aren't missing much.

11,01And lobbying for more broken laws so they can stay in business.
You thought wrong, Smith. :D
You know what? I think I changed my mind on my pick for A Movie.
I'm telling you, the US patent system is going to crash and burn in the next decade.
Canadians have been planing this invasion since before Shatner
11,01If not sooner.
Staying optimistic William, I like that.
It's not going to crash and burn, oh no.
11,01Along with our copyright system.
That would be underestimating it.
I completely forgot abouyt that movie
NocturnalBlade: Only you and Nitt know my name.
Kandarihu maybe, but I think The First Avenger is at least a bit better at patriotism
no last "I love you"?
My old pick is still going to be my fallback option, just in case my first pick is conflicted over.
I can almost guarantee it will coincide with the crash fo the current tech industry. Most likely when Facebook finally goes under.
hi Nittany_Discord and Scoot-Scootaloo
It's going to implode like a nice little star of three solar masses or larger, and then it's going to fold in on itself.
11,01Hi princess.
1,11I just realized...Airbender's large budget could qualify it as an A movie. :P
dat freaky deaky
where's the last "I love you"?
Gotta post pone some

NO
Yes he is
11,01PillowPoni: I forget your actual nick right now.

And then, after a while, it will condense upon a singularity of stupidity.
Captain Badass, get moving already
AlienWarhead, perhaps. But the movie isn't.
Will_Smith: Airbender sucked
Er, wait.
:D
because Facebook will not be around in 5 years. I guarantee you that.
PillowPoni: ok ok ^_^

0,14I mean, they got the NYC traffic down
Batteries with wings?
AlienWarhead, what I meant to say is that the quality of the movie is irrelevant.
0,14but we're not quite THAT looty
Attaching Shymalan's name to any movie past "Unbreakable" automatically re-classifies the movie choice as "B" for lottery qualification... :(
Thus the entire world will be sucked in by their stupidity and shortsightedness.
Nittany_Discord: It's the name of Will Smith's wife in this movie :3

The green glow is a light to attract them closer

Will_Smith giant human zapper.
Don't go towards the light!
08,01ender the fleshlight
I just joined the chat and saw 'Some hookers have holes that can't be used'.
Anyway, Saxy, what did you learn from that encounter?

1,11Just wait until they find the snakes.
eeyup
XD
08,01the fleshlight has exactly 1 unit of resource (hole)
But it's so beautiful.

Spademagnes[R]: Wait till the dog-fight till you make hatches jokes

And then KABOOOOOOM
Oh well.There are plenty of those kinds of those supporters on the internet... even in the aftermath of this.
OH MY GOD, I LOVE MY TIMING!
Michael bay just came
Dear Princess Dari, today I learnt that I need to get a job at NASA.
Quaid! Start the react- Oh, shit!
They killed the Stripper!
ded.
Clever girl
bye bye Los Angeles tower
08,01let's imagine that to be useful, a fleshlight needs to be embedded into a realdoll
ScootaChicken: so you can meet Twi?
Nooooooo!
YOU BASTARDS!
what was that guy doing in that building?
0,14...what ScootaChicken said
run!!!
well at this point I'll call her Hot Twi

Judging by his lack of response, I think he learned nothing.
Aaaand Michael Bay came
He had importand business to file
And then the Fire Nation attack
And this is what happens when numbers around Jeff Goldblum reach 0.
MichaelBaySplosion!
Apparently so.
PillowPoni: again

RUN BARNEY!
11,01ScootaChicken: You're stealing my joke.
GOD DAMN IT where are you Starfox!

1,11Aw, they beat me to the flaming joke.
0,14Hey, are you busy later?
Meanwhile, Michael Bay is having several orgasms at once.
Will_Smith: lol
You don't have the balls to say that.
11,01I also call him Princess Dari.
The Dr. Will -OOh O_o....Dont worry, we'll get you a new Dr.
we didnt start the flame war
SaxyPretender she is, she works at nasa
Not Barney! Not Barney!
and then Micheal Bay died of over pleasure
0,14XD
CriticKitten: Thanks for sharing.
They dont hit houston right?
JESUS
No Saxy, you're doing it wrong.
fire in the disco
11,01XD
SHINRA TENSEI!
Malk: they hit Houston
Meanwhile: You're welcome. :D
CriticKitten: several and then some extra to make sure the job's done
OohShiny He should "SUIT UP" for flame protections
Another Michael Bay joke
08,01more or less resource (holes) can be aportioned into the virtual machine (realdoll) by taking resource from the pool (fleshlights)
11,01These jokes are just XD-ful.
Michael Bay just've reached Nirvana...
And yeah
Actually
0,14So I should say
You are.
otakon noooooooo I live there
Deadlypon3 Nailed it

God you suck at this!

0,14XD
im trying to think positive, but since Tara is in LA that means she would die as well :(
*Back to the Future Theme.
well were

Don't pull that face I'm serious!
Oohshiny TOo bad he died; we will need more doctors OH SNAAP
So I suppose Saxy's as bad at verbal sparring as he is good at fighting games.
lol Will_Smith
TinFoil_Quickthinker she would live...,and start the first pony nation!
He took points from suave and moved them to beat-em-ups at birth.
Tinfoil_QuickThinker: Bronies would have gptten her out
I mean God, I could probably do better, and I'm notorious for being obtuse.
otakon its ok im on the outskirts so I would escape
1,11I'm sure Pyro and Demoman are jizzing themselves right now.
Will_Smith: lol
Gamera is really Neat. he is filled with Turtle Meat. We believe in Gameraaaaaaa..... :)
0,14WHERE
Right, assume she is wearing another costume.
Reikim: Saxy doesn't need verbal eloquence, he has his jacket.
WILL BOOMER LIVES?!
0,14I MUST GET HIS AUTOGRAPH
Oh no BOOMER!
here comes the most ridiculous special effect shot in cinema history, with the dog
Shinra Tensei!

:P
DOGGY NOOOOOOOO!
SaxyPretender next time Say: Explore me with your curiosity

NOT THE DOG
Stripper powers ACTIVATE!!
Saxy's the worst at trash talk. He'll be on vent with the eventual Fighting Is Magic tournament, and he'll just be saying "Er, grah, um, grah. I'll harm you!"
NOT THE DOG!
that should work
BOOMER! WILL LIVE!
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
Boomer will live
Mom's enjoyment of the movie is making this unbearably awkward.
But what about Boomer!

That is one dumb dog.
No, the dog's fine.

BOOMER WILL LIVE

Shouldnt they ALL be dead from the explosion eating up all the Oxygen in the area? :|
YESSSSSS
At talking to girls.
You say "That costume's awesome, mind if I get a picture?" Then you get the picture, just like last time, and then you follow up with a question about part of the costume.
What movie is this?
was this riff beofre the NC review?
yessss
00,10surely a fireball of that size would not use up all the air for miles
Pale: I was just about to say
Pale_Horse: that too, but just enjoy it
lol
The Statue of Liberty was crying
VenHur: Boomer will live
Ask her how she made it.
Sumica: lol
I meant int he meantime but I think so, Aliens always forget about us
Too general.
Rustymeat this is Independence Day

1,11That is the scene that Michael bay looked at and said, "I will make everything I work on based on this."
surely
yay
GNIGHT my fellow regs
he sees dead people
dat yay puke
War has changed, I have to say if someone say war, war never changes

Hm, really? I find stuff like that works fine in getting people talking.
Be specific. Ask her what part is made of, ask her if she treated the material.

THUNDERDOME
Cant we get beyond thunderdome?

There's nothing pretend about it, show interest.

War. War never changes... Excapet in all the ways it totally has... But other than that... War never Changes... Also I played "Beast" in the classic TV series Beauty and the Beast.... I'm Ron Perlman... ;)
Shizuka: don't you know any other cosplays you like?
05,15Who is dat! I see that one all the time :(
11,01I bet that pic is Shizuka.
So when does the Courier show up?
13nope

Major: nuuuuuuu
fluttercry: it's Shizuka's fav Asuka cosplayer
Major: Is count von count dead?
Okay. Now my mom is groaning at most of the jokes here.
MrBen: no, thats why he smiled briefly

I don't really care for cosplay.

thelonepony: IKR?! :'(
11,01I bet Shizuka would look good in Asuka cosplay.
One funeral! AH AH AH AH AH
hen3ry: ohhhhh. lol
I thought the small talk was the first step?
1,11Speaking of Beauty and the Beast, anyone who says that the piece of shit Beastly show is going to be any good, you can leave right now.
Shizuka: there must be someone that does a antoher good one you like
DerpStar: Yes :'(
wait the MST3K guys played half life so awesome
No Half Life 3 is the one we can't play
trying to figure out where in LA this was... I'm thinking "Universal Studios"

speaking of cosplay: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9a517Rjek1qjqw9ko1_500.jpg
The introduction is the key.
Anyway, Saxy, if you see a cosplayer in a homemade cosplay, ask about it. As far as my experience goes, artsy types love to talk about their work.
never be a bad pony LESSON LEARNED
"WHAT HAPPENED MOMMY?"
78 years! ha ha ha
But for those who are uninformed, I was coerced into cosplaying as Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club for MCM in October.
Wait who died?
NO.
REGRETS.
Aliens happened kid. Weren't you paying attention? :|
the Count
Spademagnes[R]: Everybody?
The count died? Aw man

If someone's taken the time to make something, they'll react well to someone showing interest in admiration for it.
08,01i'm a good pony
It is one of my weak points.
they don't stand a chance
Also
13>not suzumiya
"Ha ha, he said ass!"

ScootaChicken could totally pull that off.
Oh whoops, thought you were talking about the movie.
wait wait thelonepony Who died
HE DIES NEXT
<.<
you're a good pony. Now rename usr to ussr
ScootaChicken is a dude who looks like a chick, that's why he got that one.
LOL
Shizuka: I know, I always think Haruhi Suzumiya the whole time as well.
XD
This guy is SO dead
1,11Wow...that...was so gay.
heeaarr yeah!
Shizuka: Ouran > Haruhi
He wasn't just the Count of course
05,15I'd like to be Richter Belmont....or Scott Pilgrim...
If I were to cosplay Ouran it'd probably be Honey.
400 rupees he dies next
I'm sure he'll live>_>
Meanwhile funny cause haruhi is a chick who looks like a dude
I could only go as Ekei Ankokuji or Ghim...
Three grieving wives! AH AH AH AH AH
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yes that was the joke.
The count is ded cow334:'(

Picky, picky.
get those earbuds I posted
05,15Dem UN resolutions
Aw. I missed the Half Life 2 one
It's almost as if the force fields are reacting to the missiles as if they are active energy instead of potential energy that is released when they reach the target.
13i hate having audio in only one ear
they're cheap
good idea
08,01Shizuka: do you squeak when squeezed?
Star Wars-like soundtrack
SirGanjalf true
they have good if not great sound quality

Red Shirts. Red Shirts as far as the eye can see.
13nope
13i go pff
I got a cut on my ear and had to listen to only one side for a while, very annoying.
brush it GENTLY with a toothbrush with some rubbing alchohol on it
Do a barrel roll!
13the sound of being deflated
1,11QUICK! Send the Jedi for agressive negotiations!
Iron lost the satelite?
Hahaha
A better idea is hope that the Aliens will stop fighting and drop their shields the first time they hear music.
Like a deflating baloon.
lol the aleins didn't think to destroy the militery satilights eriler?

Now it ain't.
do a barrel roll
They're four, they talk, they're old enough to learn what the hell NO means.
Shizuka: ...I know your pain. Just moved, and my neighbors have a 4 year old. She is so loud, I can hear her at the back of my house, despite her being ACROSS THE STREET.
Grand Canyon?
13ja
sure
Of course it sucks more that the only original Muppet performers left are Carrol Spinney (Big Bird) and Dave Golez (Gonzo). Frank Oz may still be alive but he doesn't work with Muppets that much aside from going on Sesame Street from time to time
USE THE BOOST TO GET THROUGH
1,11Who needs fuel when you got SWAG?
I love my noise cancelling headphones
on of those canyones
*canyons
and my buds
they cancel noise good too!
"AHHHHH! A SHEET! A SHEEEEEEEET!"
05,15You're starting to look more like your father
pod racing ...
My one weakness
Hell, when my sister was four, she was freaking reading. And yet, still threw tantrums.
Couldn't the alien just... yknow... fly OVER the canyon and still follow him?
yes
but why would it
Will Smith is that badass
my sister was a terror at 4
So many random explosions, Michael Bay would've climaxed at least 5 times by now.
nice puppet
lol
that's why i keep a pair of buds in case my headphones die
00,10and he died of two broken legs
He looked so dead when he landed xD
she treated me like a goddamn jungle gym
there goes his ankles
Hahaha xD

I don't wanna think about Michael Bay doing *anything*.

And after the reapers, ponies!
0,14sad fact: they never say kvetching
Lucky survivors..

We could use Dickshep right now
If you had an alien spaceship wouldn't that be the first thing you would use against
Hey Big_Macintosh_1992
Spademagnes[R]: kinda...
OohShiny, how about a nice game of intercontinental biological warfare?
You know, I never got that.
Or Walt Disneys head.
Polydunami: whats up?

The president's wife. . .wasn't she in DC with her husband?
1,11Will Smith's brain doesn't need a filter.
good job will smith
Don't be so hard on yourself.
05,15Oh you mean all that stuff about the meth business? Lies. Gus Frieng is a legitimate business man
He so mad
Kandarihu I don't remember all the Wargames wargames

I COULD'VE BEEN HAVING A BAR-B-Q!!
LAWL
Why don't eat the alien?
thats a lot of people
0,14he seems kinda sketchy though
it's completely greyed out
I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A BAR WITH YOU

Wouldn't it be funny if Area 51 had absolutely nothing in it?
I'm on Google maps
Run away!

hey hey hey
If Area 51 were just a red herring?
If it's just like, storage for paperclips.
Just piecing together what I remember. I probably didn't get that right, but whatever.
Oh shit is Megaman Zero 4's opening!
COME ON AND JOIM MY CONVOY
0,14alien paper clips?
It didn't.
Join
I've seen the Corn Palace AND Wall Drug! :$
1,11He should have gotten his jet joined with AAA.
05,15yup. like otakon said. It's just....grey
Ahh, the great migration of Trailers...
Area 51
area 52 is where we keep the aliens
wait... but area 51 is on google maps
just wow
that's neat
Wall Drug has free ice water!
1,11I'm waiting to see Don Cheadle somewhere in this scene...
Reikim: it's been suggested
cowvarkian because google maps use satellites
cowvarkian: But that guy wasn't using google maps.
So Saxy, any other questions about why you totally could have pulled that chick if you knew what you were doing?
Where is area 1-50?
Dat sarcasm.
I'm sure the department of education could have done a better job... totally.
Incoming data.
I always think Area 51 is the hometown of Suda 51... :(
Area 51 is paper clips. Area 52 is aliens. Area 53 is where they're keeping the 5 other seasons of Firefly
WoompaLoompas?
OOMPAH LOOMPAHS!
lol
Space Odyssey ref
0,14Not really, Meanwhile
ha
05,15RAID AREA 53!
lol RAWRity
What ever happens to Area 1 to 50? :(
13area 55 is where sammy hagar is kept
Really, the best advice you should be giving Saxy is Step 1: don't walk away this time.
The DoE... they'd make sure that ALL the kids would be like the Vegas supporters who got vaped.
something
Area 51 - the most known top secret place in the world
You sure? I'm enjoying this.
inb4 Brent Spiner
11,01And now contamination.
VenHur: downsized in budget cuts
actually was Area 51 in Fallout games at any time?
Plot hole
if i remember correctly not even the president has any rights to know if this place exists
Shizuka: only like, 4 people will get that joke.
Ohhh...
13i know..
0,14I got it
13good song though
HAMMAH
0,14yeah
I don't get it ...I'm sorry

Holy shit
0,14why do I even bother
oh that song
SirGanjalf: I love area 69 ;)
Data will save us all.. :D
I don't get it either.
THE SONG
SirGanjalf I see what you did there
it's from a song
BRENT SPINER
05,15I got it. I just don't like Sammy Hagar
I don't even know the song.
11,01Can Shizuka drive 55?
05,15He ruined Van Halen
Meanwhile: Sammy Hagar had a song called I Can't Drive 55
he's an android
DOC ITS YOU TO THE FUTURE TO escape this hell hole AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy
13i can but apparently my comfort speed is closer to 45
RAWRity: Sounds stupid.
Not...sure...if...want
fluttercry: let's be fair here: Van Halen ruined Van Halen
Last time I saw the sun was in 62
1,11You know...he seemed even MORE human when playing the android...
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9agojeKP21r9u6yko1_500.jpg
Thats because Data was Best Human
13which is funny cause it means the racing games i'm used to are depicting extremely slow travel
DerpStar Great place in San Adreas
*pause for dramatic effect*
It's Blue!
05,15But David Lee Roth was so much better!
my comfort speed seems to be 5 MPH over the speed limit.
11,01Superramp.
11,01Area 1 is best area.
Where the hell is Kyrpto?
What if...Area 51...have made the technology...change out DNAs...?
Oddly, 60 km/h is nerve-wracking, 40 is boring, but 100 is perfect.
fluttercry: a shame he couldn't stay off the drugs long enough to be a god damn frontman.
....Hmm...
13granted it was 10 miles of interstate in the middle of nowhere illinois just as the sun was setting, with semis everywhere
I'm partial to area 7
Area 42 has all the answers.
*our
Remember. Don't let Data KNOW he's an android, or he'll have an existential crisis and go on a killing spree... :|
Cinderblocks lol
...You're going to make my mind overthink that now, VenHur...
05,15wait I missed Brent Spinner?
sure
11,01I can go fast.
AlienWarhead: I wasn't thinking of that 69 dear
13i could do 65 but i think i was distracted by curves and hills and let it slow way down while i was concentrating
0,14fluttercry, gogogogoog
0,14now
0,14go
And they have Krypto in the next room
DerpStar OH MAI
0,14still gotta learn to drive
Area 85 is a portal to Equestria
Deathfest
PEOPLE ARE DIEING
1,11Gizmo's inside? He *IS* Data!
I know how to drive
Area 54 is the funkiest
:D that singing bass
deathfest
killnastic
I'm just horrified of doing it
deathival
Deathfest 66!
13that was...
11,01I would regularly do 70 or 75 MPH on the drive between PA and SC.
I don't like driving.
Area 42
13it'll be a year ago november >>
"PEOEPLE ARE DYING! And yet we had a 'funny' scene with the jewish sterotype"
Perhaps they keep the portal to Equestria in Area 51, too...
the real reason Hagar couldn't Drive 55 was because his car went up to 4000 RPMs everytime he broke 50
area 63 is
11,01The speed limit would be 70 in many parts.
05,15WAIT WUT!
I've been in several auto accidents already
And even if I did I can't afford the rest of the lessons.
05,15The hair dude?
Area 34 is very interesting
Area 101
05,15HE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE HIM
the Vault
area 34
...otakon. How?
too much suggestive jokes
11,01And if you did 70, you would get passed by the entire interstate.
passenger
Rule 85: If it exists, there is a pony of it. No exceptions.
Area 33 is where they developed the secret o making the glue on Post-It notes...
13between four-year-old emma and the general stress my parents have at their jobs anyway, i don't look for time to insert "let's have shizu drive around"..
Area 404 is nowhere on the maps.
11,01If you did 75, you'd get passed by half of it.
Deadlypon3: You do realize they are portraying Jews as saviors here right?
1,11Fluttercry: He let it grow out and died it to give himself a new identity.
oh, Data
ALIENS
Kandarihu that's Rule 34.2
thelonepony don't want to see whats there.
Shizuka: steel yourself!
SpiritFang: Damn it Area 51! We wanted to see it! :(
But if you go through Area 6 you have to fight Andross' defense line
13ha
Nittany_Discord: sounds like the parking lot for my school.
VenHur: I know, right!
13i'm more made of balsa wood than any flavor of metal..
Barbetos me nether
Derpstar Yeah....And it's still dumb
Trust me, never visit Area 63
okay Bronys our new misson break into area 51 for the portal TO EQUESTRIA we can make anything happen so this is like making popcorn to us
otakon: =D eeyup
Area 34... uhh, better not go there
13and yes that's brent spiner, data
holy crap it is
How do they nom
13this would have been the year before First Contact i think
0,14fortunately, dad used to be a car instructor
I recognize the voice now
Ow. Crow. Ow... :(
otakon: well technically this was concurrent with TNG
11,01Get in a city where the speed limit dropped to 55, everyone would still do 65.
my GOD he looks horrible
00,02'giving us a lot of data'
I'm getting this off of TV Tropes
Area 1337
00,02icwudt
/me does not like driving, only drives because TheGreatAndPowerfulT needs to
05,15there's no way that's Data...I mean....come on
Area 5 needs more Pylorns
13nah voyager was up by this point i think
And yet it is.
13TNG ended earlier in the 90s
1,11We got one of them doing a late night talk show with a space-man and a giant bug.
fluttercry: close your eyes and tell me it isn't
SirGanjalf: It's best to pretend that Area 34 doesn't exist.
Oh come on you know a Data ref was coming up somewhere
Took 4 years for my mom to be comfortable enough with me behind the wheel to let me get my license.
SirGanjalf I actually go there... not for the ponies though.
fluttercry: good makeup...or he was REALLY in a slump
^^^
I've just started going through Voyager again.
oh my god the tech is off the scale
Area 63 Nittanys favorite
What about Area 6, I heard ponies are held captive in there...
Area 6
I forget which one is The portal to equestria?
00,02for those who didnt get the joke, the scientists actor also played data in star trek
>Technology is far more advanced
11,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: Sure is.
05,15dat Space Ghost reference
>Punch knocks them out
I think this movie would be a lot more hilarious if the big alien reveal was that we were being invaded by the species from "E.T." :D
Malk that's area 404
Full of disk satilights
Malk, I said 85
13for a little while
>Technology is far more advanced
hm
yeah BS
Area 420 - where time slows down
>Punch knocks them out
The trailer are invading!
I thought so fluttercry
otakon: to be fair, our technology is advanced against gorillas, but gorillas can still kick our asses 1-on-1
Pale_Horse, how about Ewoks?
>mfw Dark Crystal just came on
yeah but come ON
we SEE what this suit can do
clearance
Area 42, where you find the answer to life, universe and everything
1,11I see Kansas has decided to move to New York.
>Bronystate y u no at my house
all of them!
Wanna see my "clearance"?
LET THEM GO!!
Have one alien. Let ALL the people in
and yet a PUNCH to the "head" is enough to knock them unconcious
13mike nails it
Pale_Horse: How about Jar Jar's species?
Ewoks would be awesome too. But they wouldn't use lasers. They would just conquer us with spears and dropped rocks from gliders. :P
OH boi!
i have been all around the area of nevada and the mountains are covered by black out SUVs and other things like scanners and some minefield warnings
13a punch to the head would knock us unconscious :3
yet it can kill and maim several people easily
That secruity really sucks
Now THAT would be scary.
13no matter how advanced we get
otakon: punch to the head following a plane crash
Shizuka: but not if you're wearing a helmet
What if we advance metal skulls?
13if the force is strong enough
But at least Will survived
RAWRity: that was still shielded
11,01Even in armor?
13your brain is still nice and squishy
^
ah crap that means Canada
Where there is a Will Smith there is a way
1,11I always survive, bitches.
hmmm my suspension of disbelief is very low right now
for this movie
At least Rhode Island should slip by.
if you even walk across the sign that says if you pass this point you can and WILL be shot
canada is k tho
11,01We can survive gorillas.
the, we turn the tables on the Ewoks when we develop the technology to make a board with a nail in it. ;)
A rock dropped from the upper atmosphere would carry a LOT of momentum at ground level.
Will_Smith except in Seven Pounds
transhumanism
lookitup
13just follow the mst3k mantra, relax it's just a show~
Chicago will never be destoyed.
13eat your popcorn
Why are all aliens dicks?
Will_Smith: died in that zombie movie
0,14look up the Chunk Salsa Rule on tv tropes
1,11Deadlypon3: shh.
as brains floating in jars with mechanical arms and wheels
11,01And eat the Earth alive if we're still dumb enough not to promote space exploration.
0,14it explains that concept where
Have we seen Mars Attacks! yet?
Hiller! Boo mah yay!
13the alien ships would have no reason to blow up the twin cities so i'm good
SaxyPretender: no don't send me there...I'll never return...
Kandarihu theres omething called termanal velocity
it is a death trap
1,11DerpStar: NO! Watch the Alternate ending!
El freak xD
05,15Those vikings might be a threat
Tinfoil_QuickThinker, oh, you're right. Also wind drag.
Will_Smith: Your death is canon
Like original Derpy
Shizuka: I live far away from anything important
11,01XD
13Tinfoil_QuickThinker: terminal velocity just means it can't pick up more speed, it's still an obscenely high speed for most things
The fun thing is that if the object is moving fast enough in space, when it hits the atmosphere it'll start -slowing down-
Is El Pollo Loco anything like Chik-Fil-A?
In order to reach terminal velocity
like, 20 miles for raindrops
burn the land, boil the sea
1,11DerpStar: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/455/bullshit.gif
and they couldn't see that from this far away BULLSHIT
EspyLacopa: and the friction will usually destroy it
Pale_Horse: vaguely, but not really
you can't take the skies from me
It's only been a day!
11,01Terminal velocity in space is c.
Indeed.
Pale_Horse, not anymore.
1,11It's Kenan and Kel.
Hey otakon
:F
Ah
otakon: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule
Title on tvtropes.org: Chunky Salsa Rule - Television Tropes & Idioms
:P
05,15I live a few miles from the worlds largest Naval Station, so I'm screwed
The friction, and thus stuff like the heat.
yes Reikim?
13uh oh
agents kenan and kel?
0,14thank you Reikim
Will_Smith: I'm a Slytherin girl anyways
11,01There's some formula for it in anything else.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SEND ME THERE!
:D

Derpy was here
Goodbye all.. you'll not see me again I'm afraid :'(
Now time for forced population restoration.
AAWWW, here we go!
Pale_Horse: Nah it's probably like Pollo Campero
Is that... is that the President from BSG?
i live not to far from hanger 18 so yeah IM GOOD TO GO
Derpy was a stripper?
....so when Derpy is talking about her muffins....ogod
If the object is large enough though, it wouldn't burn up in atmosphere, and would end up striking the surface at significantly above terminal velocity due to not having enough time to slow down entirely.
dam buffer
Hey, it's President Rosalyn!
05,15SaxyPretender a pretty decent number fly over.
Night otakon, enjoy your...walk. :)
Night otakon
yeah berrypunch should speak in spoiler tags
0,14...I'm jelly
MrBen: Have to pay for the eyes somehow dear
11,01In simple terms, it's about balancing the forces of gravity + whatever is pushing the object + air resistance and solving for velocity.
Kurra: Ha
the boy or the dog?
:3 doggy
0,14it's Stands With a Fist!
05,15You lose your evening
So...why does she strip? Is it cause she needs the money?
05,15and the following morning
0,14now let's see how many people get it...
Kurra: I should have known!
DerpStar: Ah. And raising Dinky, I assume
05,15.......and that afternoon

Nittany_Discord: You speak of madness.
0,14see, everytime someone mentions Homestuck

0,14and the crowds of Homestuck cosplayers I saw
So, where's Mulder and Skully?
That jump scene

I'm sorry. As hard as these aliens try, they still aren't nearly as scary as Slenderman... :(
It just eats my time worse than TV Tropes.
0,14CROWDS
I don't know anything about Homestuck.
0,14EVERYWHERE
Nittany_Discord: I'm afraid it's impossible
It's Jigsaw!

I see dead people
ESP?

Nittany_Discord: You are asking wayyyy too much from BS
Pale_Horse: slenderman is meant to be scary?

ALL HOPE IS LOST
BALLS OF STEEL
Duke Nukem xD
They're all intergalactic harvesters
Well.
Doubletap is extra important.
13welp
I was under the impression that most hentai dubs were godawful, that's the second reason I stay away from them.
"TIme to kick some ass...and I'm all out of ASS"
Jeff's got the idea
13time to find a new planet
0,14and that's it
05,15......nothing to do here
oh wait duke nukem 3D or Forever
double taps don't always work, though
11,01Maybe they watch movies with tentacles in them and keep saying "I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going."
/me flies off in his jetpack
Always bet on Duke.
Yeah

No, Shizuka. We dont.
Newer movie, or old series, Shizuka?
Shizuka: Movie or the TV show?
"Neibhorhood watch has got a big budget cut"
It's a thing that is not generally talked about in a blunt, honest manner.

reaction to what ? i'm just reading the last 20ish something lines of chat before commenting without any idea of what i'm talking
Because the show was amazingly awesome

I was there
fun fact: there are at least three ninjas in each scene of this film
Will_Smith: It's never Lupus!

I once met a Hetalia fan who said that the holocaust couldn't be real, because Germany is too sweet to ahve done something like that.

Shizuka: I think there's some Alcohol in that cider...
Hey...it's you... CIDER! IT'S CIDEEER! *hic*

Shoot that thing off ;)
*hic* Darn tooty he's right.... *hic*
Yeah yeah, she like, rends everyone in the train apart.
Shizuka: needs Vodka not cider

Barbetos: OVER NINE THOUSAND! *Breaks scanner*
Meanwhile: if you don't like emotions, but you like cerebral stuff, check out Serial Experiments Lain
I haven't seen a good anime in a while.

TY got Spyware! Now we download a crapton of porn on the aliens computer and make their ships crash!
05,15I'm not seeing any Cowboy Bebop there....
you mean the first series?
Ah, Madoka.
0,14but personally, not the biggest fan
Shizuka: eh, that'd more my issue with Brotherhood. That damn finale alone was 10 episodes.
Does it have fluttershy gps?
Also, yes, RAWRity, you're missing Bebop.
13FMA was like 52 eps it hink
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: regardless, yusssssssssssssss
13just went on and on and on
RAWRity: I still like Brotherhood more than FMA
11,01Lol.

GO AWAY CLIPPY
13then it was suddenly HEY WE SHOULD WRAP UP THIS STORY
a super advanced spacefaring civ doesn't notice a breach?
Someone is against MURIKA?
See I've never heard of...90% of those.

BAN THEM
05,15Still better than Bleach
nevermind they're able to connect
13that's why i like 13-26 ep series, they actually conclude
good thing aliens ALSO use windows 95

05,15Over 9000 episodes
11,01Rofl

One Piece is a giant TL; DR
ALL FIGHTERS ATTACK THE CORE
SaxyPretender: There is.

Eh. Bleach ended, and then it carried on. For some reason.
Come on more dps!
all I know is Clare's gone.
0,14yep
...ohey BonyHepSits
i'm fairly sure re-entry is harder on a hull that a few meisly missles
There WAS an "Atomic Tornado", yes, but later they also made an "Alien Tornado" too.
but im really tired
05,15Shows/manga I dislike : Bleach, One Piece, Naruto, Casshern Sins, Soul Eater
Tovler: it's pretty easy.
BonyHepSits: Who're you.
FIRE EVERY FUCKING THING!!!
And cue the starfox katina boss music
fluttercry: WHY OP!?
how'd you find this room?
yeah
Meanwhile you figure that out
Also, a REALLY good manga: Angel Densetsu
11,01Well, you have a 5-episode fight taking I forget how many because fight scenes were drawn out.
SEND IN EVERYONE
Bah, I loved the Soul Eater anime. That was a whole summer for me. Good memories...
BonyHepSits: Some twonk.
11,01It wasn't bad though.
I win.
it's an EMP!
Meanwhile keep guessing
Spademagnes[R]: Which one?
THROW ROCKS AT THE SHIP
No, I was right.
VenHur: EVERYONE

Has ANYONE here watched Nanoha yet?
Clever Girl
OohShiny: Here is you're Balrog. Please enjoy your meal.
Zephyr: a shame if something happened to it
the big one that is
seriously, Angel Densetsu is possibly my favorite manga ever. It constantly battles with Rurouni Kenshin in that respect.
lol Burning Man
00,03EMP! Our electronics are offline!
I've yet to meet another fan.
05,15I seriously didn't watch Bleach for 3 months. Came back. THEY WERE IN THE SAME GODDANG PLACE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE
Conyst Thanks very much
Jeane and Clare are gone in Claymore. I never bothered to care about the other girls.

HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!?
Reikim wich one ?

Commencing...
SAVE TJHE PONY DOLL
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: First two. I didn't like third series as much.
Tovler: latest chapter: Clare's back.
Preferably A's. A's was the best.
05,15Scoot-Scootaloo if our electronics are offline, how were you able to tell us that over the radio?
Been reading Bleach Naruto and One Piece for ages. Can't really stop now.
lol
Radio isn't electronics, that's not how games work
0,14mmm, Big Mac
fluttercry: batteries
Soul Eater manga seems to be coming to a close.
Reikim i din0t like strikers either

MORE DOTS
OohShiny: If you need anything please do not hesitate to call.

Also, probably the most boring Manga I'm currently reading: Fairy Tail
Meanwhile: Bleach is wrapping up, right?
Conyst I would like the bill please
Arghagh
Reikim: It's trying to.
11,01Hardened electronics.
Where is the nuke?
05,15Now...the Persona 4 anime? FREAKING AWESOME
RAWRity: it rips on OP artstyle too much if you ask me
13that's what you get for upgrading your attack speed instead of buying ammo canteens
ohhh fuck
0,14and not doing the best job at that
Reikim: it's in its final arc, but that could take YEARS to get through
0,14fluttercry
Reikim: It could have wrapped up 2 arcs ago but then it just continued.
My cowriter is also obsessed with Fairy Tail. Another manga I've marked as not touching on principle.
0,14king's game scene
take a base of action!
That was a disturbing analogy.
Shizuka THIS FOERVER AND EVER
05,15I swear to god, they just took the game script and did it again
THE HATCHES ARE OPEN
OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDddd

05,15If it's like they've been doing so far, I'm going to be so pleased
"I'm hit! I can't stay with you!" "Get away, Wedge, you're no good back there!"
00,02Shizuka, when you add penetration the ammount of ammo you can get back multiplys, it could be quite op if one went full combad
no!
its an F movie but the riff makes it A
11,01Strange. XylemTube getting kicked when he had no colors.
