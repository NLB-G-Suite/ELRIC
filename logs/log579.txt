The X series games are on sale with 75% off on steam right now. I suggest buying them. They are really good... If you like space Sci-Fi that is.

AJTheMightyGamer: oh lucky you, man. I only did the Tooth. But some guys in my troop climbed Baldy and said the view was absolutley stunning. Good luck with the week long hike, and have fun!

Derpdash, this concert is ~2 hours as far as I know
applejack096: Pink Floyd playing The Dark Side Of The Moon
i'm good Shutterfly
oh ok ekips
applejack096: this is the root of about 50% of rock and roll
applejack096: it's pink floyd, i have not heard any of there music, so that's kinda why i am not really intrested. but it sounds pretty chillax
11,01Pink Floyd is great music.
Im a whovian as well as pegasister so i prefer Chamelian Circuit :)
^
oops
AJTheMightyGamer: you should watch the wall, it gives you a whole new apreciation for this band
Pink Floyd is alright, not my favorite but they're still pretty good.
11,02Dat applejack096
this concert helped me to get through school ~.~
my favourite song is next
Wats up Superbrony64! Where you been at?
applejack096: where do you watch the episodes from? I've been trying to find them all over the interwebs but found nothing! T.T
11,01I'd stream a Tool concert, but it would get Not Safe For Stream pretty quick.
11,01And it's bound to start some flame wars.
im pretty open to anything from before 2004
start a flame war, acquire popcorn
ekips: -5 to reputation
Nittany_Discord: unfotunate, since it's a great band
11,01Tool is from the 90s. They're still around as far as I know.
11,01Great band. I don't agree with all of their messages, but they make great songs.
Hahaha Shutterfly! I watch them live! Never missed one episode in my life! My dad wanted me to NOT be a scardie cat so he stuck the cradle in front of the TV and stuck it on. Ever since then ive been hooked!
started in the 90's= before 2004 for me
11,02applejack096: Been chilling :P
Haha good!
11,01Their music videos are super-creepy, too.
applejack096: so you have bbc?
Hiya
:p You need a lot more to get the super special evil doom ray
Shutterfly: Eeeyup! I live in England :P
11,01The video to Stinkfist creeped me out when I first watched it. In fact, I didn't finish it.
Nittany_Discord: Prison Sex is still the creepiest :D
....
11,01Oh yeah.
applejack096: ALL this jealousy!
The ooold maaaaaaan died
11,01Parabola is creepy as well.
DEM COLORS
my bad, the NEXT song is my favourite of the album
I'll be back. I'm going to watch the wall
Nittany_Discord: and Sober.
Hahaha Shutterfly! Jelouse of a 12 yr old!

Well now that you put ith that way applejack096, yes!

Thanks Nittany_Discord
/me is now afk , making a Salisbury steak :)

And by the way I ADORE todays music!
You're rather classical all of a sudden, Wrek. :P
11,01Today's manufactured pop?
i still stand by what i said, i hate modern music
MadSurge: yes
now this is music
11,01Stuff that only gets put out to sell and not for the love of the art?
^
^^
^^^
The lunatic is on the grass!
i am a lunar-tic
11,01That thinking is what's ruining the gaming industry.
^ that too

11,01Probably movies, too.
yep yep

almost*
11,01Entertainment suffers from people coming in and exploiting it for profit and nothing else.
OMG! Worst day EVER!
^ again
/me starts bawling like Fluttershy
11,01Nothing wrong with making money. It's just ruining the art in the process that irritates me.
...I'll see you on the dark side of the moon!
how is that, one direction get a cold?
Let's just face it, nothing is origonal anymore. Its hard to come across a form of entertainment today that people put their heart and soul into.
OF THE MOOOOOOOOOOON
Thread by thread
i know beiber ruined everything taking titles from queen and other bands
This Luna AND Celestia's favorite album :D
lol
:'( Im so sad guys...........
/me bawls like Flutterdhy
your music is bad and you should feel bad
applejack096: about what?
/me Hugs applejack096 "What's wrong?"
applejack096: why so serious? i mean, i so sad?
*why
11,01Not all modern entertainment is bad.
My boyfriend...... just texted me.........
11,01Even mainstream.
did chat die?
nop
applejack096: oh no....
11,01It's just that you can see where there is less love in the product.
this already does'nt sound good
oh wait i wassent scrolled down :P
He just.... just......... Broke UP with me!

/me crosses arms "you shall get no sympathy from me"
Weve been together for a YEAR!!!!!! and and now!!!!
pffft
applejack096: oh you poor thing, look maybe it is a sign that it was not ment to be.
applejack096: sorry to hear that lil' one :|
by the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
ONE YEAR!!!!!! Im gunna go for a few mins........
applejack096: only a year? gee... that sounds like my relationship.... dejavvu
*de ja vu

11,01PsychoticDoc: Beeeeyeeeeeetch.
11,01:p
applejack096: I'm sorry to hear about this, but why did he break up over a text? That's low on my opinion.
/me burst into laughter over the seriousness of a 12 yr old's releationshhip
AJ for a 12yr old thats long btw
applejack096: this entitles you to scream at him bloody murder next time you see him
And ikr Shutterfly
/me 11,01wants to play dress-up with applejack096 :p
how old was he applejack096
I think she said she was going afk for a little bit.
oh, i see...
11,01Oh.
11,01I kid.
<3
wish you were here?
WISH YOU WERE HERE! :$
brb
/me orgasms in thy trousers
11,01I'd like to hear a proper version of Welcome to the Machine.
.......
We're just two lost souls swimmin in a fish bowl
Nittany_Discord: might be my favorite song fom them
11,01Same Maidsurge.
year after year
now i'm thinking of my gf.... :)
and what have we found?
Nittany_Discord: Florence and the Machine is pretty good for an indie artist
Shutterfly: is she a nice girl?
same old fears.....
you too Shutterfly ?
AttacktheAndalite: agreed
MadSurge: oh she's great! So happy i'm with her!
MadSurge: I love her voice. So powerful and no auto-tune or fake at all
and no, AJTheMightyGamer, we're still together.
11,01For some reason, one of the Pink Floyd artists decided to add vocal backing to Welcome to the Machine, which ruined the song.
Shutterfly: well that's good. keep your love strong and trust and stuff.
AttacktheAndalite: no autotune is already 5000+ points for me
AJTheMightyGamer: I plan to. The only downside of us being together is that she's 15 going on 16 in Nov, and I'm 18. But hey, love has no boundaries, right?
MadSurge: Need more artists like her
MadSurge: Have you heard her new album that came out like a month or two ago?
Shutterfly: for me yes, 13 and under
best concert ever
11,01It's Friday, Friday. My hand is a dolphin!
Shutterfly: amen brother, I wish my ex's mom thought of that but sadly not. but yes love has no boundaries!
/me 11,01wants a girlfriend
AJTheMightyGamer: what happened?
who's concert is this?
Don't worry, Nittany_Discord, I'm sure you'll find somepony :)
AttacktheAndalite: to be honest I only heard Cosmic Love, but that's so amazing already by itself!
Nittany_Discord: i know that feel
poor Nittany
OKAY!
Nittany_Discord: same .__.
GUYS!
IQ math test
:O
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4840184_700b_v1.jpg <--- what is this
MadSurge: Listen to the rest of the album Lungs and then listen to Ceremonials.
11,01All the girls I like don't seem interested in me. Hard to tell.
Comfortably Numb<3
relax...
needs some info first
Vordox: 2
/me gave up on that whole thing.
just the baic facts
Saw this in concert with roger waters
Shutterfly: apparently her mom did not like the idea of me going out with her daughter. so in short she told her to break up with me. now she is going out with this one kid who his whole familly is bad news
Shutterfly: You sure it's not 288?
can you show mer where it hurts
Nittany_Discord: Either part has never shown any interest for me, For all the time so far
back
11,01Vordox: 2.
CriticKitten: You've been in this position before? :D
11,01Did that in my head.
vordox: positive
Some say 2, some say 288
Vordox: why? O__o
288
Shutterfly: it did not help that i was mexican and the mom is racist. i am not just saying that to say, she is racist
MadSurge: It's based on a very famous math issue
Some say 288 and some say 2.
yup that is 2
I texted my Ex Bf
It's just a "Left to right" or "PEMDAS" issue
11,01I see.
11,01The way it's written creates confusion.
holy crap, since when did we start talking about math?
Yeah Nittany_Discord
applejack096: pfffffft like its worth the trouble
AJTheMightyGamer: I'm pretty sure that's how I would be right now if we didn't try and hide it at first. Her parents love me. The only thing that they don't like is our age difference, so we hang out as much as we can when they are both working or when she goes walking around town.
how does it create confusion? always follow BODMAS
Vordox: Math and I always have been sworn enemies.
anyone that doesnt is wrong
Chrysalis: You mean PEMDAS?
no i mean BODMAS
11,01Some see it as 48/(2(9+3)). Some see it as (48/2)(9+3)
MadSurge: Math's easy as long as it's logical. :P
Google also says 288
Yep Nittany_Discord
SirGanjalf: Google says 288?
WHAT?
I thought it was 2
Shutterfly: yep, same here bud. oh well, i dont need a gf yet
I told my ex bf that its ok cuz a much hotter boy asked me out a week ago ;)
11,01Pi is exactly 3!
but its 48 / 2(12)
Vordox: Just type: 48/2(9+3)
MATHS!!! IT BURNS
SirGanjalf: Oh nono, do not use Calculator
Vordox: that's the problem, I hate going by logic :D I like finding alternate ways to solve problems :D
Bye guys :)
MadSurge: Smarter choice :P
PEMDAS: 9+3=12 12*2=48 48/12=2
*steals TticieMuffins *
bye applejack096 take care:)
Oo
Vordox: I've used it just to confirm my calculations:P
pi = o..n 1/1 + 1 / 2 + 1/3 + ... 1/n-1 + 1 / n where n = infinity
Chrysalis: You're wrong
take care, applejack096!
It's Multiplicative BEFORE Division
Vordox: I used PEMDAS
get out
really is this still on?
blasphemer
but enough math for now: i'll just enjoy the song...
doesnt matter which way you do them
Math! :)
Pi = 1,8 + suareroot from 1.8
But...
because a division can be written as a multiplaction
Chrysalis: You should have gotten 288 if you followed BMODAS
E=mc2
Uhm, guys.... school's been done with. Can we not have a math argument please? :$
^
BODMAS not BMODAS
Shutterfly school is never over
you stop learning
gunna find sumting else to do then, i'll never get the point of music concerts
whats the point in carryiing on
bye
brb
Bye Eulshy
school never over? FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
take care, Eulshy!
XD But yeah Chrysalis The REAL answer is 2
I was so happy when I was done with high school because that meant no more math :D
The fake answer is 288
We don't need no education
im gonna feel so old for saying this
ok, time to get all this gf bf talk out of my head. to tf2 i go! see ya everypony! :)
but seriously, enjoy education while you can
We don't need no forced control
cause youll never have it so easy again
^
for me its over when i get to collage, ima do psychology
Shutterfly: please look up the lyrics
i miss school
the lessons where easy
befroe i go arnold shwartzaneggar rage
and money was something mum and dad dealt with
striaght As with no revision
So....
The answer according to the internet is 288 while the answer from Mathe...logics? is 2.
Chrysalis: we have to "grow up" sooner or later, right?
PsychoticDoc: I was right the first time, but I was always told wrong.
11,01I loved school so much, I stayed in it through my 20s.
....WHICH is true!? O.o
google math uses a stack based approach to math
where each calculation is done in order
rather than evaluating the actual equation
Shutterfly: me and fishy were right, we studied the songs+ went to the concert
Nittany_Discord IKR, i only just finisehd and im 22
It's true
let math be, it hibernates during summer
Trust us
PsychoticDoc: the only concert I've been to was for Train. Didn't care for it that much. But Boston and Huey Louis are coming to my town soon and I want to see them both!
Hello everypon3
Boston?
Fuck yeah
Chrysalis: So you mena...Those who used internet to get answers...Get the wrong answer? :D
hi legacyofvrak
/me crosses arms in crossed hammer fashion
what's on?
HAHAHA I gotta remember this
Hell yeah, Fishy!
yup
back
as with most things you get off the internet
treat with caution
hi linx
google cheats to save resources
run liek hell guis
and wikipedia is a TERRIBLE place to get information from
wat
11,01I strayed away from Wikipedia during my thesis.
No it's not. >_>
legacyofvrak: to answere you question there on about math
Wikipedia is pretty stable for most things
its not 100% though
RE..You guys lied to me...there is a beautiful world outside my flat!
That's a common lie told to you by teachers who don't want you to rely ONLY on Wiki.
wut?
What about this? http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=48%2F2%289%2B3%29
Wikipedia is usually the only place I can find info on something. and its really accurate.
and more and more education authorities are penalising the use of it
But, again, there's also this: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2Fb%28c%2Bd%29
red_ony no, they didn't lied to me :3
Shutterfly then your not looking properly
Because they know if you say "Wiki is okay", that's all you're going to use.
me :)
/me 11,01washes BaconMane's glorious bacon mane.
youll always get better results from a book than wiki
No, seriously, can we take the teacher's word on this? Wiki is not a bad source. XD
11,01Wiki isn't bad.
It's just not the ONLY source you should use.
red_ony did you check it? maybe your flat is surrounded by paintings
its community authored
Wikipedia has answers, but the answers are pre made, not something self made <--- This is the issue
11,01But I'm not putting my trust in it.
Run, run run run run run run run run run run
it doesnt take much to find a page and change it
Chrysalis: I once did an essay on Madrid for my Spanish Class. The only things i could find besides Wiki were pages about touring Madrid. This was after about 2 hours or so.
a wiki is as reliable as the people who write it
and wikipedia lets ANYONE author it
Lil_B: It is really beautifl outside here...the rhine promenade is full of people who just enjoy the weather....
11,01Chrysalis: They do fact checking and moderation.
Chrysalis: Wikipedia is the most reliable source of information on the internet. Period. Let's get that nonsensical lie out of the way right now.
Wikipedia also gets checked to see if the info isn't complete bull.
Hi everypony. What's on stream
they react to changes
/me noms on BaconMane
they dont pre-screen
They have moderators who do fact checking on a regular basis. People who are paid to make sure it's accurate.
so for a time anything can be made wrong
Sweet
11,01Chrysalis: That is the thing.
please don'T get info from wikipedia form your papers...wikipedia isn't quotable....
you'd better run!!1
/me manhugs Nittany_Discord "Hi there"
red_ony my village is empty... a void of humanity, i go on the street and see nobody XD
wikipedia is the info overlord
how are people italisizing their text? I don't see it anywhere.
Lil_B: :/ ...
/me magic
/me i dont know lol
/me /me
So yeah, as I said, it's a lie teachers tell you because they know if they say "yes, you can use Wiki", then you won't bother looking anywhere else. Which is where problems emerge. Wiki isn't good as your ONLY resource. It's a good base of reference though.
/me snort snort
Lil_B: that's my town in winter :D
red_ony: WHAT??? oh god no
gee, thanks guys lol
/me pets Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2

Shutterfly: type /me at the start of a sentence
It's extremely wise to use it as a starting point for your search, because the references on any particular entry will give you somewhere to go fact-checking and you can use THOSE sites as your quoted resources. :P
/me DONT ITS A TRAP
I only use wikipedia to get an overview about a topic myself..then it's off to the library....
/me oh..
/me /me is for hipsters
/me wait
PsychoticDoc :<
/me that means
/me my chat is cursed
/me nothing is for hipsters anymore...
Funnily enough I just read a newspaper article while sitting in the sun ..about wikipedia articles...and edit-wars...
/me Shutterfly lies and blastmephy
things nobody knows about is
CriticKitten: in short, it's great to start searching for information but not reliable to the point of quoting.
are
Wikipedia the documentary
red_ony: Apearently "Neoliberalismus" is one of German wikipedia's largest battlefields...
red_ony: i meant the wiki thing but my internets slow so it takes a while to post
PsychoticDoc and Fishy: Hipsters are so commonly known that basically everything they do becomes mainstream after a while.
The hipster paradox
/me Shutterfly lies, they only move on to another source of underground, while the rest of the world discovers the origional source
Shutterfly: real hipsters don't say they're hipsters :D
Aww it's over! :(
just look at Gotye. That was really undergound before it hit the mainstream.
soon being hipster will become mainstream
and all will be well
*He
hi Chrysalis

being mainstream will be the new hipster

hey pyrocatboy how've you been
good
what is this band?
I hate flash player sometimes.
this band is great
I'm probably too old for this kind of music
sounds boring

the crowd seems to like it
someone please tell me what band is this

escape the faith sounds like music for school kids
naaah
derpy_pony: escape the fate
WACKEN!!!
erm...yes...this one
Wacken? didnt they refer this in the lord of the weed parody?
derpy_pony: and technically scince I like them, it kinda is
yes. It's a small village in the middle of Germany. But once a Year it becomes the centre of the Metalworls.
*Metalworld
It keeps buffering!
if we're listening to metal, we should totally play some asking alexandria :)
I've seen a documentary about it. Every garage becomes a bar on these days. The neighbor villages are jealous
they get nothing of the profit
how did they come up with wacken? I guess there just was a lot of empty space to cheaply rent?
derpy_pony: The best thing is, even the seniors are listening to the music, while standing at the edge of the road.
red_ony: The Farmer that owns the land once rented it for a small Festival. After that it became bigger and bigger.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacken_Open_Air it began as a small even for local bands in 1990
event
you don't day, swed?
STOP BUFFERING!
pyrocatboy i think it's just you
A nice bit of trivia is, that one of the biggest Metalbands, Man-o-War, thinks Germany is the HEART of Metal.

ShadowStep: i'm pretty sure there's some form of scechule
that'sssss a nice cassssstle you've got...
What's the castle for?
One of the first songs I want to learn on organ is Ganons theme
okay well if its organized then thats totally works for me :)
AttacktheAndalite: most likely for art :D
MadSurge: Ah.
ShadowStep: not a scechule for when streams are i mean a scechule for who streams in which order
apart from movie nights
right gotcha
Very_Silly_Filly I once was able to play "The Ultimate Koopa"... but thats 4 years ago :/
Stream times are completely spontaneous to my knowledge
Is Val still a troll. I haven't been on in a while.
Neither has he as far as I'm aware
also does everyone addess people directly often?
ShadowStep: yup
quite often, ShadowStep, but if you wanted it to be private open a PM
okay good to know thanks guys
a friend of mine used to learn the organ. he even had the keys for a church in Lüneburg so he could practice. Sometimes, when there were boardgame nights in the Gemeindehaus, we and some guys wen't over to the church at night to listen to him playing.
I have an electric organ in my house, so yeah :P
Very_Silly_Filly I'm thinking about Buying the full version of Synthesia to To Practice with my MIDIs
btw: the theme from halloween sounds awesome when played on an organ
Very_Silly_Filly: i have 6 electric guitars and 3 amps in my house, so yeah :P
Ganons theme sounds epic on organ
BronyInstrumental: Pah, needs more guitars
also around 5 acoustic
I did have around 20 at one point, but about 7 of them were broken
and some random plastic one that i fuck around on
Organ is a Nice Instrument in general, for ewerything Jazzy, Rock, and Evil sounding :P

...wat?
the last instrument I played was a ukelele, and that was a disaster. I'm sticking to my singing
08,01ah, okay
08,01i think i'd prefer an electro-acoustic, in that case
i haven't played any instruments
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7am3pwoRr1ql2603o1_500.jpg
and most people refer to them as semi-acoustic
Do you believe in magic?
ohokay
Kammerjunk depends on the magic
Friendship, yes
Lunar_Brony: In a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her whenever it starts.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7am3pwoRr1ql2603o1_500.jpg
pyrocatboy: awww he really does
<3
Kammerjunk yeah, I have a 6-year-old sister
ha. perkele
11,01Cut your sister's heart out.
that sounds cute^^
And it's magic if the music is groovy. It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie.
11,01Release the magic .

So I've been listening to Caravan Palace's "Clash" for the past some time. I can't figure out what the hell they're saying.
Lunar_Brony: +m is when only mods can talk.
...And techies.
like adult swim
oh
k
O.o how long have we been watching concerts?
Since before I went out.
Bit time.
Since about noon for me
I'm trying to figure out who the buck is playing
this band is epic
This song.
that's not helpful
I'm not a big metal-guy, really.
I mean, I like it, sure, but I prefer old rock or something.
Swing is cool, too.
OMG! <3 Humanity has chances(Shame it's in the poor industri where IQ is high.) http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4802312_460s.jpg
i don't really mind as long as it sounds good
Vordox: Do ho ho, that slaps me on the knee.
I like songs by ABBA and Electric Light Orchestra
LAWl
Dat yodle
I would buy pizza from that place every time, no matter how terrible the pizza is.
I feel like ordering a pizza now, but I'm broke
Me too.
spent the last of my cash on a Brony t-shirt
I had pizza just 1½ hour ago.
It was alright.
but it will be worth it http://mlpf.im/1bH
i had barbacue for dinner
It was supposed to be a salad, but then we just didn't bother.
I haven't had dinner yet. :D

Sweet dreams, killerpony7733.

I just have the strangest desire...to go out and take a jog...oO
russian song is best song
I haven't done so in 1,5 years...wish me luck
red_ony I was considering going out for a walk today. Probably because I was listening to the Rocky theme all day . ..
red_ony have fun
good luck red_ony
Lunar_Brony: I actually went out today already...read my nwespaper in the sun..
Lunar_Brony: And get a stroke? It's fuckshit temperature out here today
Lunar_Brony: The great weather here does this for me
hehe
afk
Very_Silly_Filly I've walked when it was a blazing 30C
*celsius
I believe I might have the lyrics to SOME of Caravan Palace's "Clash", but god dammit, the lyrics in that song are hard to hear.
no sunburn, though
It's Denmark-weather over here.
european metal is best metal
It's kinda like UK weather, except it may shine some times, and there's less rain and just as many gloomy clouds.
well today was good Kammerjunk
11,01Is Wrek asleep?
Yeah, today wasn't that bad.
possibly
Nittany_Discord: He might've gone for a smoke or something.
It's only half past 11 PM over there.
Wrek SCIENCE!!!!1!!
that could wake anypony up
Also, dem desktop ponies. The artist and the scientist.
Kammerjunk Wrek's OC is on the left
I know.
Asides from seeing it on his dA, it's clear by the drawing of Twiley.
05this is the onyl oen that fits the short gap i have
Ahhh screw me
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4797080_460s.jpg *SALUTE*
05enjoy
I am practically a walking coprse
Nightwish!
ohai Wrek
Very_Silly_Filly: Do you have a strange craving for brains at the moment?
Kammerjunk: No, just cake and the vengence of shooting people in the face for no reason, THEN eating their brains
who dat?
Very_Silly_Filly: Oh.
Well, tally on, then!
oh nightwish
I shall!
05needs more base
It always does, though.
the bass is fine I feel
Wait Wrek...
Rule of thumb: If you're able to ask if the bass is strong enough, it's not.
Which singer is this Wrek?
I think its traja
this band seems intresting
dat top hat
I'm going out for a walk. Seeya later everypony
The singer's beard. He must be a Viking.
or a pirate
Or a pirate, yes.
yes he is
Or a viking pirate.
Wait...
Viking are already pirates
Yeah.
<.<
So out of vikings, who themselves are pirates, this one is particularly pirate-y.
05its anette Olsen
The gal?
05yeh
Bye Bye Tarja
*steals Wrek*
/me is back with 6 pieces of toast
how you doing Very_Silly_Filly
Speaking of toast, I need to get more of that. I made a Sandvich recently, and I need more toast for more Sandviches.
I feel weak, destroyed, hungry, other than that, I'm fine
Very_Silly_Filly: Well, go eat some brains.
I'm eating brains on toast now
Oh.
05Zanon <3
Wrek: I've been here much much long enough to know where this is going >_>
*steals Very_Silly_Filly 's toast*
/me shoots zanon in the face
alexxm: I found a picture of his beard and I'm looking at it right now. He's definitely a viking.
ok Kammerjunk
Ummm
I can tell because http://derpy.me/sQa3s
who ? Tuomas?
yeah... traja was better
No, Marco.
*tarja
That's quite a clashing tache
I still have the toast
Zanon: You should be dead
I shot you in the face
What did you guys think of Skyrim's Dawnguard expansion?
Then ate your brains and kidneys
pyrocatboy: ...Is it out?
Sorry... but I don't like this kind of rock :/
I haven't been playing Skyrim the past week or so.
dont have it. is it good?
Not played skinram in months
http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p197/lzanon/MLP%20pics/00rafaelzanonphonias.png
theres always more than one zanon
Dawnguard is epic and its been out for a long time
Oh. Is it a free DLC? I can't seem to find it when I search on Steam.
its a $20 DLC
Free? wtf you smokeing?
Around 14quid
Dovah: I'm asking because I seached "Dawnguard" on Steam and found nothing.
Dark_Horst: One of my friends (Manoso52 -has a youtube account-) told me that it is quite very good game, but hes bored about exploring the world, I would like it because its similar to Fallout 3
But its worth it because you get crossbows.
But it is on Steam, yes?
yeah
it is
Curious.
hey guys
legacyofvrak: skyrim is awesome for exploration, i can tell you that much. got it when it came out... but i'm a bit apprehensive about buying the addon
Yo, BronyInstrumental
legacyofvrak: So it's not similar to Fallout Vegas?
I really can't find it.
it would need to have a lot of content to motivate me to spend my money
Dark_Horst: And thats why I like it :D... I loved soooo far Fallout 3 :D
:P
I don't like it
When you hit lvl 50, you're invincible with daedric armour
best zanon ever http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wpid-1341087763880.jpg?w=640
Very_Silly_Filly: Skyrim?
Yeh
Very_Silly_Filly , Well, love and tolerate, then
Not in my books
I hate and disregard
What do you people mean, "it's been out a long time"?
lol, Im listening dubstep, and its fitting perfectly to the stream
:D
What do you mean, you don't agree with me!? Do you know who you're dealing with!? *Pushes button and world explodes*
I'm sorry to ask, but who's Zanon? *ignorant*
Very_Silly_Filly: late reply but level 50 deadric armor? fight a legendary dragon then say that
Zanon is Zanon.
Dovah: Dunno, never really played it long enough
Very_Silly_Filly: DO YOU SEE THIS BUTTON??? IM GONNA PRESS IT :TheLivingTombstone:
I hated it by level 34
I am zanon
Bad Very_Silly_Filly you are a Very Bad filly
Zanon lol
No, I'm just expressing my opinion
Dovah don't forget very silly.
I find Fallout a lot more phin
btw last drawing i link wrek did that
gotta give him the credits
No, but really though, is the exact release date for Dawnguard on the PC even known?
Came back because of the ponify addon in Google Chrome
Because I wouldn't play a Bethesda game on a console if I was paid for it (Okay, that's probably a lie).
its ok to not like things but dont be a dick about the things you dont like ~ twilight sparkle
Did I lost something?
Zanon: thought that eyestyle looked familiar :D
or miss
Kammerjunk: problem is, the controlls always get optimized for consoles and then feel sucky on the pc
Dark_Horst: Best way to see that in action is look at Skyrim's UI.
Kammerjunk: while the pip boy in fallout actually was a petty cool idea, the skyrim interface makes me cry out in agony
God, I love mods.
wrek totally r63'd my oc from a lil colt to a mare . everypony loved the pic so much i made a char of her XD
TBH, I'd rather play it on console than PC, mainly becuase it's consolised
Havnt people already cracked dawnguard for pc?
Kammerjunk: Go marry Luna then
so that is phonias.
I have...no food... I'm dying here...
Very_Silly_Filly: No, I meant mods. Modifications.
For Skyrim.
shittons of mods
Skyrim updating is a day of dread for me and my mods.
tbh i think this discution about what is better fallout or skyrim is stupid because they are both great games but set in different universese therfor some things will be better than others in each game.
good thing i dont have many mods. i once tried improved lighting, but my laptops cpu didnt agree with me
I wonder if someone made a mod to bring the mythical backwards dragon back.
the wat?
Dark_Horst: I once tried to improve everything. Skyrim still hates my guts.
Dovah: i wasnt aweare we were comparing them
Dovah: then again, i just jumped into the middle of this when my chatwindow loaded up
Dark_Horst: niether was I :P
I wonder if someone made a mod to bring the mythical backwards dragon back.
pyrocatboy: Dat derpy dragon :P
ban dodgers
Dovah: To take that a bit further, I don't even compare FO3 to New Vegas. I think both are equally great, just that New Vegas is different.
well, there'S mods to replace dragons with luttershys
more terrifying than you would think
i see it like this: fallout 3 had all the athmosphere, new vegas all the content
god I hate my internet connection I cant connect to xlive
Great, now you people have given me Sons of Skyrim stuck in my head.
Kammerjunk: and thats a bad thing?
Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, Naal Ok Zin Los Vahriin.
Morning.
Bleh. That wasn't even a finished sentence.
Kammerjunk: dat ping
Oh hi, XAX.
hi XAX
Dovah: Wah Dein Vokul Mahfaeraak Ahst Vaal.

oh and hi
Hello.
/me is getting headache from all these windows and conversations..
Holy hay, I only have 90 tabs open.
00,03Hir Kommit Alex?
I usually have way more.
Dovah Stormcloaks or Imperials?
00,03hier*
Hi o/
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hallo, Alejandra.
pyrocatboy: it depends but usually imperials for the sole fact I like Bulgruuf and the guy that replaces him is a dick
00,03>: (
hey Malmortius how've you been
been good.
you?
Silly vowels.
i'm good
00,03That was my 2nd ex girlfriends name! :D
Dovah: /)
Scoot-Scootaloo: Sorry, I didn't mean to end it with an 'a' D:
(\
00,03Applebloom: Likely Story
If I don't play an Imperial in Skyrim, it basically goes like this: They tried to chop my goddamn head off. End of story.
Kammerjunk: Alduin saved you for that but you still kill him at the end whats the difference?
from*
11,01Hi Scoot-Scootaloo!
Dovah: He's the final boss. I kinda have to.
You guys dont know the lyrics to mlps winter wrap up?! :( Im so disappointed!
Also, he's been raising quite a few dragons.
Kammerjunk: who says you have to do the main quest line? there is plenty of other things to do.
Malmortius: 'Course I do. I had it stuck in my head for a month or two.
and destroying a few villages
Dovah: Eventually, though, there's not.
alexxm: And that.
Kammerjunk: eventually = 8 months
Dovah I always found that hilarious. If he didn't attack to kill you, you would have died! XD
Applejack/Rainbow dash has a really nice voice.
Not at the rate I played it.
(I totally "owned" the game with my first character, though)
pyrocatboy: ever have the glitch where he just flies around in circles and never lands on the tower?
goodnight everyone :)
Dovah nope.
Night, legacyofvrak.
pyrocatboy: its annoying..
bye legacyofvrak
night
hey guys :D
Salve, Nittany_Discord.
Nittany_Discord: Bleh. Wrong ping.
08,01hmm
Kammerjunk: You have to explore very single dungeon in the game. not just the quests
Hi, NickThePegasus.
hey NickThePegasus how've you been
11,01XD
08,01who would like to buy a commission from me?
Dovah: I can play after the main quest, though.
08,01£10 for a really stupid, crap drawing
'Tis possible.
QQ: why do I suck so much at spelling/grammer today?
08,01FULL COLOUR TOO
Pegasus are best pony who agrees.?
Nope.
08,01Zanon: denied.
Unicorns are.
Kammerjunk: I have a level 81 that still hasnt beaten the main quest line?
08,01earth ponies are best ponies
pyrocatboy: no
Dovah: That's how you play the game, then.
Me, it was my first character. Story time is fun.
im new here ^^ and ive a question whats a brony?
Kammerjunk: umm I kinda cheated :P ohgma infinium
Dovah It is hilarious.
comeon My litttle Pegasus Flying is Magic.
pyrocatboy: ill check it out sometime.
NickThePegasus: A person who enjoys the show "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic", but is outside the "intended" age group.
does going staghit to solitude to get sheogaraths change things staff count as cheating
ok thanks :D
Dovah: Word of warning, massive buttclenching may insue.
pyrocatboy: da phuq?
i approve
and i habe another question: from where do you kknow the names: Vinyl Scratch, Octavia and Lyra? ^^
Timberwolfs are best pony!
The fandom.
NickThePegasus: fan made names
oh thanks ^^
NickThePegasus: Originally fanon names, anyway. All of them, with the possible exception of Lyra, have become official AFAIK.
Or has 'Tavi become canon?
Dovah: Its nhis word for when people are like "OOH YOU HAVE TO PICK THAT ITEM UP! YOU DIDN'T PICK IT UP! YOUR THE WORST SKYRIM PLAYER EVER!"
Kammerjunk: Lyra was one of the first ones to be put on the toy
Kammerjunk technically lyra is official now she just has a last name as well
XAX: I thought her name on the toy was Heartstrings.
alexxm: Oh.
They changed the toy of her from 'Heartstrings' to 'Lyra Heartstrings'
Kammerjunk yeah what XAX said
That's nice of them.
It's the little things.
But is Octavia a canon name, too?
i don't kniow
I don't recall seeing any official 'Tavi toys, but then again, Toys'R'Us is too far away.
and now my last question what can i all do here? ^^
NickThePegasus just chat i guess might be an idea to check the rules
13but.. what about me :<
Kammerjunk: Hasbro came out with some card collection. One of them was 'DJ PON3 and Octavia' with a picture of both of them on it
Hey everypony!
Unicorn is best pony.
XAX: Oh, that's cool.
hey Calcos323 how've you been
alexxm: Playing Age of Empires 3 with an English bro, things have been going good
Shizuka: You aren't an Earth Pony?

Oh, I didn't even know you had an OC.
13it has been there for months...
Shizuka: That bronystate cake.
I am not good with Internet.
bonjour
People are sloooooow.
Why hello there, RAWRity
CriticKitten: what are people being stupid about today?
God, I hate bugs.
Except for spiders. Spiders are cool.
Kammerjunk: spiders aren't technically bugs
Fair enough.
Kammerjunk: Spiders aren't even insects :p
Yay spiders!
can i post a pic of the spiders where i live XD
Spiders because of their 8 legged frame, they fall into the arachnid group of organisms
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded cool.
What're we watching?
Speaking of "bugs" as you easterns call them, I have a "bug"ger on my moniter now which I'm gonna shoot with a flamethrower
Shizuka unicorns and vivi are best ponies :3 /)
/me is so funny
and dont forget to brush your teeth
Very_Silly_Filly: Oh my. You have a bugger? As long as it doesn't bugger you.
JÄGER<3
It is, and I'm gonna blow it's brains out
Ooh! RAWRity, is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas an A film or B film?
Kammerjunk: hmm, gimme a moment
BTW l4d2 5 bucks again no excuse now !
Pah, I bought it in '10
Very_Silly_Filly: bugger (noun): vulgar. A contemptible or pitied pony, typically a stallion.
Meh, I've got the 360 version
...goddammitponify
pitied person, typically a man*
Kammerjunk: well, big name actors, made by a big studio, 18 mil budget, and a 7.7 on IMDB would suggest it's an A movie
:3
Everyone ready for a double dose of Die Hard and Star Wars tonight?
If you see where I'm getting at
I wish my 3DS could run flash
RAWRity: Would anime movies based on a series be considered B then?
oh, and since we mentioned bugs earlier: http://socialmediaseo.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/giant-weta-insect.jpg
I'd totally watch the stream on that, then chat on my Piepod
RAWRity: Ha! Then I was right!
die hard? i thought it was robocop and star wars?
Eddmario: depends on the budget/critical reception.
in 2 days time I shalt get off my lazy ass and stop procrastinating writting that fanfic.. well at least the next chapter :p
RAWRity: aw, that'S cute
^
RAWRity: ololol
Hey folks.
RAWRity: That's a neat bug there.
Oh hi, FairysHuff|STEAM.
hello FairysHuff|STEAM
I find it slightly amusing how neither the insect or the man give any fucks and go on their merry ways
Kabaka Dovah Holla

So yeah, I found out I have a spider laying eggs in a corner. I'm so excited.

Zanon: that looks like the logo of a spider-man villain.
hehe
Kammerjunk: SPIAIDUH EGGZ. Sorry, something me and my friends have sensation of saying
Kammerjunk: so I imagine you're moving to a new home soon?
RAWRity: Aww, no. They're cute.
Kammerjunk: until they all hatch.
Ooh, there's the little prick
and you have to have your hosue fumigated.
Brb
It's a tiny spider. I live in Denmark, they don't get very big.

Danmurc

Well, THAT was a fast shootout
00,1015min in and already gunplay
well that didn't take long for the first bullets to mfly..
Sumica the movie is self aware
Kandarihu: much more dangerous stuff than box cutters were passed through in those days - toothpaste, liqour, coleman lanterns, tackle boxes full of hooks and other sharp objects...
Nice shot
Sumica: Pah, if it was my film,I'd open it with artillery play
It's Die Hard, not Hamlet.
Is basicly how every doe hard movieis?John mclane meets terrists on his vacations?
You came for the bullets.
Sumica thats the old god movies for you

Cypresswolf, indeed the dangerous nature of the objects doesn't make all the difference. The intent of the owner is more of a factor.

What's the point of that machinery...?

11,01Why is there blood on my baggage?
Vordox: luggage sorting
oh and black guy didnt die first
tackle
Vordox, to kill things
Vordox electrocuting big rats
Kandarihu: and now everyone pays for someone else's malicious intent
Vordox: Conviently placed machinery that crushes evil bastards and kills them
Death By Luggages...
fukyu
oh snap!

DROPPED IT
so THAT's why my luggage is always covered in blood
Kandarihu: You talking guns?

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-

that reporter
Hrafn: So it's not my fault?
What Calcos323 Ryunosuke XD
apparently not :P
I'm making a promise to the world
00,10done been told
If any reporter comes and interviews me, I'm gonna talk shit
Cypresswolf, not everyone. My mom rented a car to drive instead of fly up. I'd say car rental agencies aren't suffering for that.

IT'S UP TO CAPTAIN FALCON
Aw, man...
is the Media as worse in this movie as in the first one?
00,10trying to pickax through the permafrost.
Then again, the main reason we went by car was because of the costs of tickets, not the heavy-handed security.
Kandarihu: If you want through security, call me.,
Just make sure you buy me tickets
troll
lol he de- oh wait
00,10he just so happens to keep an unloased gun around for shock value?

Sumica: doesn't everyone?
Sumica: Come on, I keep a unloaded handcannon about.
I do!
00,10hey it's the bare ass cop from nypd.
Kandarihu: Driving is the way to go more often these days - I hate the airports, the pat downs, shoe checks, bag checks, metal detectors, and the things that arent allowed on the place even when I bought it in the area after those "securitys check points"
Omg flutter shy yay!
YER THE ASSHOLE
Yo, that dude was the captain from NYPD Blue
F.U.N is what I call it...
IT'S BEVERLY HILLS COP ALL OVER AGAIN

I hope so

Personally, I frankly don't even most of the inconvenience over that. After all the security, most terminals are a nice place to be. Constantly watching my clock so I don't miss my flight bothers me the most there.

That would cause a panic, and it would easier for them if they didnt have to shut down a riot while still safely gliding down the plane.
"A right man in the wrong place can make ALL the difference."
Luna: Then you may as well do it for almost every character in this film.
BROMANCE MODE ACTIVATE

mClANE IS BEING mClANE
Vordox why you spoil :(
That church is a deathtrap.... wow I thought I never use those words in a row

Nowadays, the only time I hear banging at night is around Independance Day. Hey, maybe it wasn't even gunfire I heard.
Darf14: Must be Ironic... >.>
11,01Blue magazines?
airport guise have yet to realize terrorists no longer have control.
they make 10rd sstripper clips for 223.... I have a box (and more came with the ammo can)
That's why I shut up about talking about future events 0P
Yup.

Let's go!
Star Wars! :D
otakon: Nice aim.

13Nittany_Discord: i throw a brick, an hour from now someone goes OW WHO HIT ME WITH A BRICK
Time for teh epic

SlurryMoon: What lag?
Yay
SlurryMoon: Not getting any lag
11,01That's one slow brick :p
13where the punchline is far removed from the setup
SlurryMoon: All good on this end
you do not eyeball a brick? some one, some place at some time is going to have a really bad day?
AND THEN STAR WERS.
dat theme
too bad lag has reared it's ugly head again....
I have a 1950 version of this Fanfare from some old western Movie XD
No lag for me SlurryMoon
3I'm getting a tone of lag on my end
ihear some star wars
3ton*
The Empire Strokes Dick
dat 1980's cinema
Sumica: needs more tincan
13so for instance, has anyone seen dinky, fifteen minutes later we found her in the popcorn
SlurryMoon: for once it isn't me yay!
otakon: you always seem to get lag :S
no lag here
Is it me or is the sound quality low?
hey im back, oh boy i made!
There seems to be a jitter in the screen but it's not lagging.
There's no lag on our end....
looking good for me
SlurryMoon: Sound is a little off though
Lil_B: Know a name of it?
And yeah otakon you'd be lagging regardless.
We should watch Spaceballs
Pudge: not always but it seems during the great movies.
00,10what the hoth
otakon: that's rather unfortunate
lol otakon's lag.
SirGanjalf just a sec and I got the name
darth vader is butthurt
SlurryMoon it's lagging a bit, but it's catching up. Buffering, then suddenly cutting ahead
dat cursor
And after this is Family Guy and that'll be it for tonight
did somebody say star wars?
Dat cursor.
:3 Don't buffer at me in that tone of lag
lolwut?
I thought that was my cursor at first
At least from Slurry
11,01Vader isn't evil. Just angry.
and what
And then....
Indeed. You do.
now theres lag
Why do they call it Hoth? They should call it Coldth...
wow, that's some serious lag
:(
3wow, that audio is weird
Um what
11,01He lost his wife.
whoa
00,10my video froze
uh oh
07,01I see a mouse!

Luna: You want some cheese?

11,01Is that some of Flaria's cursors?
Empire's Cancelled? :'(
Moveis over everyone go home ;)

inb4 no shit
00,10yeah it is Nittany_Discord
First I get lag, then I get buffer, and now I have an ad
there we go
okay fixed now
Lunar_Brony: damn i missed it then
11,01I use Rainbow Dash.
00,10the luna one by the looks of it
3I don't think that audio is fixable
inb4 cut to Rick roll
11,01Same set.
SlurryMoon: have you tried lowering the quality?
Lunar_Brony: You need adblock.
3but I know it sounds weird
Nittany_Discord same
SlurryMoon: Its fine
Star Wars :)
Yay!~
I love those cursors. :3
The buffer is damn to high!
It doesn't sound weird to me....
gah
SlurryMoon: I require Sumerpan to show up every so often.
video jumped a bit
SlurryMoon: for me its fine
yeah I'm looking at a slideshow
Behold! Giant Space Cursor!
Meanwhile but it costs money! And I'm broke!
seen most of the originals, haven't seen much of the prequels
otakon you're ALWAYS looking at a slideshow.
yay hoth i think
Space.... the final fornteer
Lunar_Brony: Costs money? you're doing it wrong.
no buffer cirle, but the audio plays fine and the video goes jumpy.
ah the battler of Hoth
00,10one probe to check whole planet.
It's a Probe Droid....
wah wah wah wah
Smooth as butter on this end.
Lunar_Brony: Adblocker Plus for Firefox is free to download and use.

otakon: take some of my anti-lag spray
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...
Smooth for me
00,10waka waka waka waka

Sumica: lol
Probe Droids like probing
Did anyone here ever get one of those Star Wars Lego sets that has thousands of pieces to it? (Death Star set for example)
nao i is hungry
dat buffer
MOPPIT
Beep Boop son, Beep Boop
shitty snow planet
11,01Why didn't they spam probe droids in the first movie?
Hmmm. I have mixed opinions about Star Wars.
Sumica a certain someone mst be doing the budget :S
They should have sent lots of them like in Shadows of the Empire or Rouge Squadron
Dat Stopmotion animation
video is seriously chugging
Nittany_Discord because it would make sense?
Or maybe the ton-ton's saying "muppet muppet". Ton-tons are British?
Nittany_Discord: bc the Rebellion wasn't a legitimate threat before
Nittany_Discord: all military budget was going towards Death Star construction
Personally I find Star Wars in general to be rather meh.
Pudge: so not just me eh?
nope
otakon oh, THAT adblocker. Mine only blocks pop-ups.
Wrek: thank you very much http://cheezburger.com/6451157504 specially on the third part
Lunar_Brony: yeah mean
It's got some neat moments and it's a fun universe but I don't really care about it.
man*
also, refresh it helps!
oh well it seems to be fine now
COOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yea, same here
and then SNOW BEAST!
FJSDFO;FOIHNGF
OSHI
Dat snow beast
Nittany_Discord: It's the latest innovation?
He ded
It smelled death!
abomible snowmonster
Smells like a yeti
IT'S A DEMON FROM MY NIGHTMARES
Snow Beast? This is from that movie Pitch Black right?
I liked all of them, really, but I didn't see what was so awesome about it. Personally found Lotr alot more entertaining.
Did you know Taun-Taun's are actually reptiles?
the force will keep you safe from such... oh. oops.
WHAT NIGHTMARE MOON!?
Those Yetis
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN SOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
inb4 clerks 2 debate

He's Mr Snoooooowman, and he ain't taaaaaaakin it from no maaaaaan~
Hans Olo

Han SOLOOOOOO
Basically telekinesis.
Pudge good idea. I've got 4 other programs hogging my internet I should close
Kandarihu: Bout what? A Tab error?
Dken2021: That thing scared me when I was little
I'd go "Cookie" here, but seeing we're seeing Family Guy after this we should just save the FG parody quotes for when we're actually seeing it
yeah lag is back
otakon: sometimes its best NOT to know what its saying
Lunar_Brony: just closed skype and steam seems to be working better
Freefall29: he
Freefall29: Chewbacca is a he
and he is awesome
Details, details.
red_ony, no. For not noticing your sarcasm about Bruce Willis being in the last movie.
it's a thing and it does a screetch.
Pudge thx for the suggestion. A bit smoother now
All that needs to be said about Chewy.
UST UST UST
Ninjazz: no, he is Chewbacca and a mighty wookie!
I sense some hostility in them two
Kandarihu: :D Such things sometimes translate badly in the internet..
dat buff
Ord Mandell
Hun Solo
THAT NAME IS FAMILIAR!
isn't Ord Mandell a old intergalactic space dump?
Yeah. Well, I should try harder to spot that.
Magic.
Ord Mandell is where you fight IG-88 in Shadows of the Empire
Und dann he arranged that.
oh the drama
Aside: Wookies are amazing in b.... nevermind.
burrrrrrn
PinkiePieYoshi64: I knew it!
Without the shiny arua.

Dken2021: they don't brush their teeth
SirGanjalf got i its from "Broken Arrow"
Dken2021: they also don't bathe...cultural thing.
otakon and there goes the kissing booth
Lil_B: Thanks, Lil_B :)

Dken2021: yeah , Wookies are only good for dual-wielding being a HP sink.
SirGanjalf SCIENCE!!!!1!!

Dken2021: eeyup
DAMN YOU STREAM WORK RIGHT!
Calcos323: Plus our show is in nothing but good tastes
if someone serriously says we have no taste, then I really would question the things THEY watch. :S
otakon: what browser are ya using??

Lunar_Brony: a bit
Calcos323, we have a taste for ponies. That's what makes us bronies.

Freefall29: it's firefox, but I think Slurry is having issues too so it doesn't matter.
StinkomanFan, I don't know what that is. I don't want to ever here that name ever again. o_o;
SPIKES MISSING
Oh it begins like it'll end!

Notice how it takes him ages to move the fucking saber whereas in newer pc games a jedi can easiliy throw around a whole space station
Oops sorry

Firefox is the best for streams
Whew. DayZ is... Really boring. =|
and fixed
I concur
Freefall29: madness
Fun fact: a lot of this snow scene was filmed behind a hotel with snowblowers.
Freefall29: MADNESS!
well i'm on IE atm and its perfect. I was using chrome yesterday and it was pure crap
Well Luke hadn't had his Jedi training yet, so maybe that's why it takes him forever
R2 is best D2
Dken2021: He doen't get much better
try explaing that
Freefall29: odd I'll check in a minute
Freefall29: Chrome is a bad browser, it crashes when I try to use it
red_ony yea
opera also works fine
I"m using chrome and it's fine... no problems since I got in...
I use chrome as well
try maxthron
07,01chrome is fine here too
Freefall29: Sumica's stream yesterday was lag free for me but Slurry's was lagtastic until the end of the movie. Honestly I think it's the movie itself.
brb
Pudge: I use chrome all the time and it works fine for me
I have an installer for Iron. I should install it already.
otakon: looks like it
Its never worked fo rme
for me*
i'm trying to limit myself to chrome and IE, the two browsers my laptop come with
I would use the IE tab, but that has no security
Mabye use internet explorer? xD
Maxthon is awesome :)
so much EQD
i've never had an issue with Chrome
IE9 is really good too actually
okay I'm back
/me uses Chrome
Wb.

Dken2021: It was already dead
And i thought they smelled bad on the outside
but i that it was fun
Since, you know... she found him and all.
CriticKitten, true.
They must smell good on the inside then.
Obsidian still, that poor ton ton
Freefall29: haunted majora's mask is actually a convincing story
Gondor isn't a person damnit.
fung shuei the lungs!
it's bigger on the inside
07,01gonna ask me what?
:3
It must be the stream. I'm the only one in the house using internet, I've closed every other program I can that uses internet, AND I'm getting my maximum of 5 bars
Puppets where harmed in the making of this film.
SNOWSPEEDERS :D

SirGanjalf: lol thats exactly how I feel.
vreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemmm
echo base, this is rogue 2... I found them!
11,01'dis tune
Man, Epic Meal Time did a pretty good rendition of the Taun Taun.
dat music
07,01Good question.. I did not see him!
a story about a boy getting a haunted cartridge from a creepy old man off the streets.... crazy stuff happens... file corrputions... game talking to him.... all around ghost story... seems legit
OtakuTom: well Slurry did say he was having issues at first too, I think mips doesn't like us is all.
Oh man I love this scene
Apparently the issues they were having with the speeders were an overnight fix
Damn...
good scene
I love the music :D
GREAT restoration
I remember this level in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron on the n64
3actually, otakon, it's not me
dem views
Han solo is now Luke Skywalker
3it's you, the majority of people here say it's fine

Hes giddy

Meanwhile: and OtakuTom
Dat smile.

Looks like he's not SOLO anymore.
otakon: Yeah sure whatever, but it's mostly you.
SlurryMoon: I'm getting a little bit of lag but it's not too bad
dat diaper
dat amniotic fluid
Bacta: It's like water, except more science-y
Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is one of only two games I have a physical copy of for my N64. The other is Zelda64
SlurryMoon it's getting better. I'm still getting a buffer show, but it's less choppy now

3hey, I paused and lowered the quality. Now, this is the farthest in quality I'm willing to go, so this better stop the buffering for all of you
PinkiePieYoshi64: Not Rick Astley!
PinkiePieYoshi64 at least he wont gibve us up or let us down

Appreciated, SlurryMoon. :)
dat droid sound effect... damn you empire at wat
war*
Thank you SlurryMoon
pew pew pew
pew pew pew boom
thx SlurryMoon. I'm getting no lag now
If they need the shield generator intact to protect the base
send in the pew pew cats
I think it's still looking good.
Yaaay...
yay
Why not put the shield generator NEXT to the base so it's covered within the radius of the shield?
yay
War never changers... or dose it? The answer is no... unless it is yes...
Just got here. Time to evacuate
I wonder how often they change base
*salutes*
That theme
dat theme

Yea, my connection speed is fine. I'm getting 7.26 Mbps, which is more than I typically have on this connection.
JEWS IN SPAAAAAACCEE!!!!
i was only joking. :D
Pudge: Space channel is worse than buffer channel
CriticKitten: maybe it cant cover itself, cause that would make an inverted shield or somth
When we make intersteller ships i demand they are star destroyers WHO ELES IN AGREEMENT
That's it, the Rebels are there, And I'm sure Pinkie Pie is with them >.>
Thrackerzod agreed
Did they say HUMANS?
Petrified_Discord: NOTHING is worse than buffer channel
DONT DOUBT A LORD OF THE SITH
Thrackerzod: we also gotta make walkers
Pudge: XD

Dr. Droid!
and Iceland
Where were those guys in LEgo Star Wars?
twilight_sprinkle: Maybe, but then there's another solution. Build two. One inside the base radius, one outside. Shieldception, and the base stays safe.

Lil_B: I know:(
SirGanjalf: He'll use the schwartz choke
I'm just trying to figure out what else could cause the problem...I guess I can try rebooting...it can't hurt, lol
Hewwo there, Eulshy.
And so the picture list grows. http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg
anyhoo, brb again
hah nice pic
CriticKitten: maybe they cant cross. the most you could do is build a chain of them, but rebels havent much moneys
11,01Not the Schwartz code. Schwartz blast.
Meanwhile, looks like a You mad face.
/me eats Nittany_Discord
Inbound Best Epic Battle :D
Dun dun dun
Meanwhile: Maybe the best in the collection
Does anyone have an album with all the "Buffering" pictures?
lol he has a personal bubble
/me 11,01overtakes Bronysith
Soon enough we'll have a entire slideshow of buffer images
Question... what IS this thing Vader is sitting in?
/me digests Nittany_Discord
darth vader being a jerk. that vid is funny
Lil_B: Meditation pod.
08,01Lil_B: space toilet
He dead
Dat choke
then porn
you have failed me for the last time...
Lil_B: meditation chamber. it is much more comfortable for him since he is pretty much limbless
11,01That's a long reach.
Lil_B: KinderÜberraschungsei ^^
inb4 ded
my internet crashed
suddenly field promotion
ded
best yet worst premotion
00,10You have faile me again, for the first time for the last time.

another dead mook
As long as Vader can see you, you are DED
so much ded
and Lunar_Brony is "taken"
Nittany_Discord: do not underestimate the power of the force
somepony_else: lol
I like those guy's costumes though
Need a cleanup i=on Section 3.
How many of the people on the internet would LOVE to do that.
Ded. Move along.
implied execution
This scene is so great
Captain Piett had a much longer life expectency than Admiral Piett does, tho
How did Robin Hood: Men in Tights start the "ded" meme?
oh look, it's the other woman in the universe
Being able to forcechoke the people on TV. It would truely be a coveted power.
i like dis scene
hello bronies, I am new to bronystate
Barbetos: doesnt help
Barbetos: but their under your command. so it still becomes your responsibility
this battle is epic
Why does this remind me of the Solar Empire vs the Lunar Republic

hello DoctoDoctorWho , welcome to Muffins!.... no wait Bronystate *facehoof*
hen3ry: Ion Cannon, cuts through shields
11,01The first toilet has flushed.
wat?
titguns
Calcos323: Mammary Cannons
inb4 he ded
00,10better idea, keep disabeling them with ion cannon shots till they fall out of orbit
the calm before teh storm!
Ions should be easier to shield against. Dat charge to mass ratio
i remember playing this map on starwars battle 2
dem assualt rifles
Oh. This isn't those 3 additional Star Wars films I've been hearing rumors of, is there?
otakon: Jug Blasters
thats a huge bitch!
Hear that? Daks got this one guys.
Welcome to Bronystate, DoctoDoctorWho. Rules and FAQ. That stuff's important.
You hear that! Dac can do it by himself!
this reminds me of Battlefront II
I mean, there are still only 3, right?
we need a bigger gun
08,01oooh
ATAT <3 :D
DoctoDoctorWho what Kandarihu said.
Calcos323: Funbag Artillery
brb
Darf14 I could make you a cannon out of Ductape
dem AT-ATs
08,01so *this* is where that pinkie pie thing came from in Anthology 2
all terrrian sumthin suthin
Those are the most impractical anti-ground units ever designed.
Echo Station 5-7 we're on our way
:D
lol yep
11,01Good Ol Hoth Battle.
Sumica: it might not disable it enough to make it fall
Hey, it's every Star Wars video game ever.
This should be fun
08,01otakon: i've never seen V and VI
thats like WW1 Trail-Wars, Rebels are germany and Emperium are English with Tanks :P
Ductape Cannon? Deal! :)
Star wars? looks a little like 2142
Attack paturn delta.
otakon: Breast Projectiles
CriticKitten: how so? they're heavily armed and armored and the four legs allow for a wide terrain usage.
08,01i've only seen IV and I
Calcos323: hmmmm... I'm out of ammo.
08,01i've got all 6 of them on my hard drive
the two legged varient, now THAT'S impractical
XylemTube: That game was gdlk
otakon: VICTOLY
hen3ry: agreed.
Darf14 if you can supply the ductape, I'll make it for you in a month
I fondly remember this mission in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.
otakon: Well played, good sir
it aint strong enough for a lightsaber tho
00,10sweep the leg
08,01in fact, the ones we're streaming are the ones i supplied
otakon: A large patch of ice and they're down for the count. And they're much too tall. Heavily armored treads would be far superior.
inb4 blaster kill
somepony_else btw, is dearth Vade in every 7th egg? :3
08,01but i've never gotten round to watching them
Appljeeack?!!? AJ?!?!?! :O
CriticKitten: yeah but treads can't handle all terrains
Calcos323: i never got t play it :(, meanwhile were getting BF4 instead of 2143 D:
ded
08,01and i missed half of this one because i'm meant to be working
He's dead, Jim!
gotta go repo an AT-AT
well, hes fried
Applejack was a rogue? :O
CriticKitten: four legs is better for stability and terrain usage overall
did he ded?
otakon: That's why you equip them with snow treads.
Sadly, she didn't make it :'(
Thinking on it, are those walkers even stratigically wise?
11,01AT-AT keeps on going.
XylemTube: They want the CoD audience, and they aren't going to do that by being unique
legs are just silly
mylilpwny: he ded
Heres some Ductape made by ducks *gives 100 rolls of ductape*
i think the 4 legs woud bypass any "ice slippage" issues
Or are they just for eye-candy and looking baws?
pewpew pewpew
otakon, what about shorter legs
of course, Lil_B ^^ well... at least if it isn't a happy hippo :D
ponibas: especially with those giant flat feet
AT-AT dont give a fuck
Nittany_Discord they are powered by Duracell, they just keep on going...
11,01Flying low there.
yeha
One does not simply stop AT-AT.
GabeMoist: eeyup but they want intimidation too
Duct Tape Cannons, HASSHA!
THIS IS IT!
and slow speed
AT-AT's are largely for intimidation. The Empire builds their stuff to look boss.
>four legs prevent ice slippage
theres the problem with a mech
what Lunchbox
i remember doing this in battlefield. solo.
>a simple metal tow cable can trip them up
who knew a giant metal camel was so imtimidating?
Seems legit
CriticKitten: but not trippoing
maybe they just should have gone with the wheeled design on this one...
*battlefront
Dat trip
Mommy, I want an All Terrain Armored Transport for ma birthday :D
watch the blaster kill
DED
legs don't move..
It NO EXPLODE
that is a pretty big weakness....
booom
How did that even blow it up?
Boom.
Before it was a problem
Well how is it NOW they breach the armor???
yay biggs and wedge
Armor weakened by fall?
Barbetos, they shot it.
How is it being down going to make a difference!?
Major: Because plot convenience
/me Holds Knee, "Ahhhhh,,, feeeee, Ahhhh"
What is it with the empire and big easilly exploited weaknesses?
Head made of explodium
Gravity! There one weakness!
Barbetos: maybe the armor was weakened?
They shot the neck, which was a weak point
Barbetos, they can't fly above it and shoot that spot.
yay
They shot the weak point for massive damage
Yes, it makes no sense for it to be destroyed by one shot after falling. It's armor was friggin' intact!
Pudge what was the point of tripping it then? =\
lol
Pudge: armor behind the "head" is weakest and the neck is the vulnerable area.
Barbetos: to keep them from moving
11,01Did I see a Skype window fly by?
the only reason this battle went as bad as it did is cuz "attack pattern delta" means "Fly straight at them in the only direction their guns can actually hit us"
Dat AT-ST
Nittany_Discord I think so
Nittany_Discord: I did
nittany - no, figment of your imaginatio9n
dat Snowtrooper
Chicken walker is best walker
CHICKEN WALKERS
otakon: I realized that shortly after typing
boizzz
Scootawalker
Rogue II!!!! :O
Scootallo Walker is best walker
It just buffered for me again. Anyone else?
DoctoDoctorWho: well that and main generator going down
NOOO!!!!!
Kandarihu: eeyup
Pudge luke could of just used the force to make that shot, its not the first time he made an impossible shot that way. =P
11,01Nope.
pew pew pew pew
not my favourite character :(
Anyone that doesn't get a lot of buffering?
not wedge
Wait... wasn't Wedge Rogue II? Then who just got shot?
Oh well. I dun like to over analyze so I am gona shut up now. Yay star wars!
GOIN' DOOOOWWWWNNN!!!
Barbetos: Maybe it takes a lot out of him at this point?
PinkiePieYoshi64: Dac
Kandarihu I have 0 buffering
Wedge Antilles doesnt die iirc
Ah ok
I've not gotten any buffering.. just the 2 video hiccups
no, Biggs and Wedge survive ALL three movies
Biggs died...
otakon: and all the books ive read
Biggs bought it in the first one
They did this in tiberian sun too!
otakon: Biggs died
Biggs was two days from retirement, too.
Spectrum_Rush|: not yet!
Wdge is only non main to make it
Spectrum_Rush|: he lived dammit
otakon: but yeah, biggs died in 4
NO!
RED SPY IS IN THE BASE
NOT BIGGS!
lol
NO DAMMIT NO!
otakon: he died in the Death Star trench
ota ota otakon :D
R.I.P. Biggs
otakon: GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, MAN
COWARDS!
I'm sorry to say Otakon, but Biggs died with Vader....
lol!
And kicked.
Get me closer! I want to hit it with my lightsaber!
hiya Panda-Homework what's up?
otakon, forst for night?
/me noms on otakon
weeeeeeee
first*
otakon keeeick
Now THIS is a weakspot
kerzap!
EPICNESSSSSSS
it's legolas everypony!
Frag out
otakon, nada :d just sayin hi... and wow you have been kicked 13 times today?
What in the FUCK is?!!? BOOM!
right in the 'nads
yes it isn't a movie night without me getting kicked.
Lightsaber + Bomb = Massive Damage
a massive weakspot
Its the chats way of tyring to tell you not to be so hard on the keyboard otakon
it was pregnant!
Boom
Panda-Homework: no I just got on today that was once.
Darf14: Wombo Combooo
his head exploded from the epicness
noooooooooooooooooaaaa*smash*
Hitting that enter key so much could break it
EPIC
Did I just see an off-the-shelf explosion?
Well to be fair, that's the easiest way to take out a tank. Open the hatch, use a grenade, GTFO.
this battle means serious business
SO MUCH EPIC
Who design these things?
/me pats otakon's back "Only you're qualified to take that much kicks and live, man."
otakon: how do you get kicked so much?
Yeah, I can see how walkers like this are totally superior to the low-to-ground snow tread units I suggested. >_>
BOOM!!!
/me gives otakon a xanax
Pudge he types to many messages to quickly
Darth Vader, you are clear for landing :D
Pudge: I "talk" too fast.
Two down, one from a HAND GRENADE. That's money well spent.
My head would explode to, if i was hit in the balls with a lightsaber
C3PO can run?
:D
Lil_B: more like shuffle quickly
more of a fast waddle
ATAT are probably chinese and dont cost much, they just spam em and win like now
/me THE TAL SHIAR HAVE ENTERED THE BASE!
otakon, hm... seems Sumica's kick counter is all time then :D
Treaded vehicle would have same grenade vulnerability.
:O
oh wait
HEIL VADER!
DUN DUN DUN
11,01Darth Vader has switch sides.
:O IT'S DARTH VAPOR! ...I mean Vader
AT AT is OP! NERF!
Snowtroopers: Like Stormtroopers, but with more KKK-like helmets
00,10my what?
see the co-pilot? secretly he's singing the ants go marching
There goes my apprentice
Dark Vapor
Sumica, kick counter...
/me speed bags Sumica
Hurry, before Vader realizes he built you, and uses his root password.
Dat engine stall cliche
dat car sound
It's Lord Helmet:O no, wait...
Lol
11,01They shouldn't have worked on it.
Just like my car.
Okay, I don't want to jinx myself, but it looks like rebooting fixed my lag problem.
so much sass on dis ship
incoming epicness
where was that on tatooine??
EAT LAZOR TIC TACS
Run AWAY!
shut him up or shut him down!
OtakuTom that would actually do well
dat turrent
curses, if only Vader could run
ponibas perhaps too many civilians?
ponibas: he may have installed it later
/me gives Nittany_Discord rainbow dash nomming on muffins

Almsot found the droids that there were looking for
/me 11,01hugs Rainbow Dash
Nice PinkiePieYoshi64
Dken2021, no "innocent" civilians on that planet!! It's a hive of scum and villany!
Remember in the force unleashed when vader could stop a ship using the force.... Yeah he has been getting lazy.
dat droid spazzing
Darf14 They are not the droids you are looking for.
R2D2 is best space core
Barbetos: he's getting old
Rainbow Dash doesn't nom on muffins...
Barbetos: also that was Starkiller
/me gives Nittany_Discord a Rainbow Dash feather duster
ponibas, so is the internet.
Ninjazz: that's Derpy
ponibas ah forgot
There not the droids im looking for 6_9
R2D2: "Um, Luke, last movie, did we have hyperspace engines? I'm pretty sure that's a hax..."

how do you miss those
otakon: good?
look at those maneuvers
Bronysith: suddenly Skyrim?
Drift lazily to the left!
Bronysith: yeah good
yeah.. how did they not see that coming??
otakon Pretty sure that Vader could do what Starkiller does. Vader gives him Starkiller a good run for his money on several occasions. Vader is just lazy.
Imperial idiots.
better use thos manuvers
Dat Traffic jam
Droids can act better than most actors these days
otakon: how about fantastic
11,01A little bump and grind.
Bronysith: uhh, ok?

It's an asteroid field
Dken2021 I am!

maybe brower is infected with something then, dunno which browser you use.. if firefox, maybe a bad addon
Closa?

so how is it that small agile fighter crafts crash and the large ramshackle dosn't
Expert pilot
If asteroid fields were actually this dense it would all be gravel in 10 min
Does anyone here play Age of Empires 3?
twilight_sprinkle: i am orc, cause i think they are pretty good with that berserk ability, also they start out with good smithing
XylemTube, the large ramshackle is also agile
XylemTube Star Wars
anyone notice te TIE fighters are blue in this movie?
XylemTube he knows s ome manuvers

08,01it's quite interested
Dovah how does one do that?
Calcos323 would you prefer the entire movie again?
08,01*interesting
fail, again
08,01obviously had a *lot* of work put into it
Dken2021: Duck tape
Bronysith: i play on medium. i wonder if thats why wrek at level 3 got gear drop two times better than what i get at level 20
watch me breack down again!
De ja vu any1?
Dovah ah I see
00,10wait, did't a droid explode due to a bad motvater?
twilight_sprinkle: he made it man
I've had a bad motivator all my life.
Sumica, only a little bit
twilight_sprinkle: you got to craft to make the best armor
Bronysith: no i watched it, he got 44 damage two hander drops at level 3, im 20 and i only get 24 damage
i'm gonna go to bed in a minute. see you later everypony
Sumica: Everything needs a motivator, otherwise their machines would get depressed
twilight_sprinkle: i havent done any missions, i just wander the fields of skyrim, and find mines and shit
bye
dem odds
bye Freefall29
Bye Freefall29
Bronysith: yeah i did that for a while, i only got my first dragon shout today
/me cries due to Nittany_Discord swatting him
seeya Freefall29
and to answer the question, TIE pilots prolly have tunnel vision on the target
Sumica, maybe the movie exploded due to a bad motivator. Maybe that's why it restarted?
Dream of ponies Freefall29
so dey crash
closer?
twilight_sprinkle: i found the ice shout. i got to get the stupid unrelenting force bullshit
bye Freefall29
DoctoDoctorWho: u still here?
JESmith: seems legit
also, it's FINALLY lag free
yes im here
11,01Don't eat my maid outfit then.
I think that restart did it
Bronysith: hm ice shout? i found a animal summon shout near helgen
Dejavu
Nittany_Discord: but....it taste like skittles :<
That's such a col shot
DoctoDoctorWho: check your pm (aka my name below chat)
twilight_sprinkle: when do dragons appear? do i have to do the main questline first?
Bronysith: Yes

Ponies47 Episode I
Goddamn those eyes
THOSE EYES!

thats my point. On, say, Titan, little gasmask would do it. The problem is just the air isn't breathable. On the asteroid Ceres, OTOH, your eyeballs would pop out

I want the originals on blu ray
Jedis are Paldins I guess

And then, Extended Universe establishes that "Light Side Jedi" are still allowed to do things like shoot lightning. lol Extended Universe, u so silleh
dovah u still here?

http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pokmon-acceptance.jpg
I knew I took too long
I have both, so my answer is irrelavent
Quick_Thinker: the path of light is one of passive ness, i.e. not going in with weapons means no Vader would have shown up.
I got a blu ray player in my pc...plays movies and games too :D

Actually I had a short movie idea about it
Pudge: Ok :)

I LOVE that Robot Chicken sketch where they discuss Vader not actually having Force Choke
so he doesn have na off switch
lol
I remember asking my dad about these movies, and the hype leading up to the release. he made it sound so awesome.
C3PO isn't whining, HE is complaining. :[
If it werent for her he would not be able to grace us with his prescence
fukin' Lando!!
Two Stormtroopers screw up, and send the new guy to tell Vader. Vader kill chokes him then has to fill out paperwork since he didn't have life insurance.

IT'S A TRAP!
Where's the admirable when you need him?
see that's why I'd reverse it... AJ lives in the Clouds? AJ should be Han, with RD as Lando. :-P
SlurryMoon: once again TOO SOON!
Quick_Thinker: Like some shadow passed by, right?
*admiral
hen3ry: that could work too
and Big Mac could be Chewie!
YES!
Admiral Ahkbar = Knows when it's a TRAP!
the hay?
nope, even admiral ackbar is not amused by that
That awkware yaaay....
that would work right!
Mac would be best Chewie.
^
otakon: Did you see images of Luna, too?
dem pings
Anybody else here that yay
What about Cheerilee?
Big Mac as Chewie! A stallion of few word.
What's that ping sound anyway? Is it a Windows sound?
Damn you NGE. :D
07,01I see images of me all the time
Sabershy: yeah I'm pretty sure I did.
07,01most of them are fanmade
Everlasting_Joy: this is my fav lightsaber duel
I love this scene so much!
Luna: but you ARE her..well kind of.
Bronysith: Ditto.
Luna is EVERYWHERE O_O
Awsome scene
AJ as Lando, and Mac as Chewie... seems LEgit
Everlasting_Joy: so much emotion and great action too
incoming boss battle!
EVERYWHERE O_O
I hate it when i get my schwartz twisted
Luna: so good to see you, are you enjoying yourself dear?
this scene always sticked in my head i once was doing a test and suddenly i said out loud the FORCE IS WITH SKYWALKER XD
3oh man, it's this fight
Vaders geting pwned
07,01watching starwars :)
XD
OH SHI-
3time for srs mode face
RD get down!
SlurryMoon: best lightsaber duel
@Luna: That was pretty clever... :$
LEGO STAR WARS FLASH BACK
RD DOWN IN FRONG!
I saw that pic
i saw rainbow dash at the bottum
I freakin love lightsabers. They need to be real.
Luna: i love this movie.
such emotion!
Bronysith: Not to mention, the scenery complements it so well.
"I see your schwartz is as big as mine."
CriticKitten: oh, thanks for that. now i know p,p
I like this Duel Fight style...
Raribot: can't happen
*whispers* I see screaming ponies....
oni_link: This becomes more apparent when you see the third movie, and he's not even carrying a blaster at all.
Vader fighting Luke Once-handed
can too!
also, Everyone loves Luna :)
Bronysith: No (squee) you do :P
Raribot but a simple swipe can cut off your limb
11,01I hope Wrek finishes my maid r63 OC soon. I want to make a big post of Maid Discord on my Tumblr.
Everlasting_Joy: and the lack of music adds to the tenseness of the situation
Raribot there impossible to make
No fucking jumping and doing EXTREME FRICKIG MOVES that waste TOO much time.
ITSS A DOUBLE CROSS
Ponies47: stfu
OH SNAP
Bronysith: No (squee) you do :P
The word impossible means nothing to the determined.
Trololando
Bronysith: Agreed, in this regard.
uh oh
Troll chewie
XD
Raribot: well not when SCIENCE says otherwise
yeah Lando should be AJ
Trust him! Trust him!
please, trust he minority
"I Knew all along: had to be a mistake!" <<< Best Threepio line xD
SEE! TRUST HIM!
otakon: No, Trixi
Vordox: no Trixie is Jabba
let him speak ffs
The driving force behind science can be argued to be determination.
Also, cookies.
Jabba is not Trixie. ._.
What are we talking about?
racist 3PO
Vordox: oh yes she is
08,01trixie x jabba?
"he's only a wookie"
otakon, Fatty Trixie? Me gusta
08,01whut?
bobba has best voice
Jabba should be wit someone that's insanely greedy.
StinkomanFan: O_o
Which pony is Vadar exactly, Nightmare moon?
Everlasting_Joy: i mean. luke is a novice at sword play, and you can tell. vader is just toying with luke the whole time and could strike him down anytime
StinkomanFan: :D
Diamond Tiara as Jubba?
Jabba is Diamond Tiara.
Vordox: well we got no greedy ponies
DIAMOND THE HUTT. :D
Shooeie: that could work
For sure.
Jabba - Blue Blood?
Now picture that scene... Big Mac absolutely crushing Dash... and Rarity shrugging apoleptically - "He's only a farmhand"
11,01Nope.
Macintosh, they're right BEHIND YOU!!! :O
hen3ry: YES!
Bronysith: Agreed, but of course, but of course "he could be a powerful ally."
Fatty Diamond? EVEN MORE GUSTA
dat r2
GODDAMMIT WE MUST MAKE THIS HAPPEN!
08,01storm troopers really are quite bad shots
Everlasting_Joy: i know right.
R2-D2 is best R2-D2 :)
lol, you suck at lightsaber, Luke.
i think is the first movie i have ever seen that made me think it was a loss for the good guys
Everlasting_Joy: ogod. i have seen this battle hundreds of times
Quick_Thinker: it IS a loss
http://derpy.me/FROkM
Everlasting_Joy: i get chills every single fucking time
Bronysith: :).
NOPE
Quick_Thinker: it wasn't called "The Empire Strikes Back" for nothing
"Impressive... very Impressive..." (:<
I AM FROM HEROES
awww lol
11,01Oooh.
EAT DUST
Goddamn great scene
11,01No freezing for Skywalker.
"Most Impressive"
I see your shwartz is as big as mine
dat mindscrew
Everlasting_Joy: and notice how luke sweats
Haters gonna hate
No Luke don't do it!
Aaaar! Matey
SUCH A AWESOME SCENE
AARRUGH
ahh my internet went out
The first time Vader screamed?
Damn ads
Everlasting_Joy: in the shitquels, they never sweat
DED
Quite the love-hate relationship those two have got going on......
Bronysith: actually he's covered in coolant at first
Bronami: Get adblock
inb4 Troll Vader
sudden lag slowdown
Bronysith: Not only that, they're so coreographed, it hurts.
11,01Light tunnel!
also i remember this LOOKING SO COOL
Im on my tablet i dont have adblock
I WANTED THAT WINDOW IN MY BED ROOM
He activated Vaders Trap Card
Everlasting_Joy: "You killed my master, i shall have vengenace.... BY DANCING"
Everlasting_Joy: it fucking stupid
Everlasting_Joy: WHAT is wrong with coreographicy?
hello peoples :D
In the Lego game you defeat Nightmare Moon by screwing with her breather
Quick_Thinker: I still want that window in my bedroom
Hey RocketBrony! :)
Everlasting_Joy: and it goes on for so long that it becomes so boring
and then FORCE THROW!
Hello RocketBrony
hiya RocketBrony
Hi RocketBrony
SO COOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE COOL-O-METER IS ON FIRE
otakon: Call me silly, but is that a serious question?
WEEEEEEEEEE
whoosh
Luke is getting pwned. XD
Bronysith: Wait, are you talking of the podrace, or the fight scenes ;).
Everlasting_Joy: IKR? he thinks that the prequel fights are better. i mean wtf
SO BUCKING COOOOOOLLLL
ahhhhhhhh :[ my laptop keeps hibernating because it gets too hot and just when this fight is coming on
then vader feels bad
derp.:P
Everlasting_Joy: they all sucked lol
/me 11,01dusts Everlasting_Joy with his softest feather duster.
/me is dusted :).
but the prequel fight are much more well choreographed
Everlasting_Joy: yes it is, why is choreographicy bad in star wars for Jedi fights but not lousy when it comes to the martial arts movies that helped inspired Jedi?
Luke Fights (LV23) Vader is LV90 .... RUN you fool!
/me gives Nittany_Discord s rainbow dash a hug
Dammit R2 had a Critical Failure
this entire movie was made of pure concentrated win
who has heard of jontron or the movie birdemic?
This is going to be John William's Epic Cue!
but that happens when you plug into a power socket and NOT a interface.
RocketBrony: I watch jontron
Right....
cool :)
Now! :D :D :D :D
RocketBrony: I have, it's hilarious to watch and on my B movie list
Saw that review, worts movie
RocketBrony: Mee I love Jontron!
DOOR OPEN YOU BUCKET OF BOLTS
JUST OPEN THE DOOR YOU STUIPED LUMP!
worst*
C3PO seems to have gotten more emotional in this movie
how come there armor dosnet do shit why do they even wear it?
Around the beginning of One Piece, my favorite major battles were the ones where Usopp fought. Not because he's so strong but because he's so weak. It was amazing to see him transcend his cowardly self once every major arc.
3PO's emotion chip got turned to high.
08,01yay no cgi
Everlasting_Joy: i mean. where was the emotional conflict between obi wan and maul? it was just dancing. very stupid
BEST MOVIE IN MY OPINION OF ALL TIME
otakon: Coreography isn't bad per se. What I don't like about the coreography of the prequals is, the difference between the prequals vs. the sequals is night and day.
3P0 got much more prissy
hey guys oh sweet star wars
"This is WHINIIING!"
pew pew pew
otakon: it's worse than epic movie, so I doubt that will ever get picked
08,01Bronysith: and Serenity
Best Escape scene EVER :D
Everlasting_Joy: yh bc it's the same universe but fundametally different movies
LANDO
Bronysith: exactly
just 40 minutes into birdemic and we suddenly see birds dive bombing! thats normal.yep
Pudge: if it's picked it'll go the way of the room.
otakon: In that repsect, the consistancy is off then.
RocketBrony: :D
THIS SCENE IS SO FREAKING COOL LOOKING I WANT THIS ALSO IN MY ROOM :D
RocketBrony: I've lived long enough then.
Ambush!
GEE I WONDER WHATS GONNA HAPPEN HERE
08,01Bronysith: but the aliens were freakin' hot
Everlasting_Joy: exactly
11,01Suddenly Vader.
no one in 1980 was ready for this
Avatar is more like a CGI animated movie with live actors in it.
good thing that sneak attack failed
Suddenly, an Antenna! :O
Everlasting_Joy: i saw phantom menace first. didnt know it was star wars. then i saw the OT and i was FUCKING BLOWN AWAY
Vader is obviously letting him live
Thrackerzod: duh, Good guy(Luke) will win, ofc
Vader's pushing him back easily. >_>
NOT
I LOVE THIS SCENE
ICONIC LINE COMING UP
Everlasting_Joy: no one complained of fancy martial arts in goddamn KOTOR and that game was VERY faithful to the original source material.
END!
11,01-1 hand.
MY HAND!
SUDDENLY GOOD GUY LOSES
/me go's and makes a ham and cheese sandwhich
Best line ever incoming :)
and by hand

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo

Bronysith: Huh. That's kinda interesting. Well, since it hurts I guess I wouldn't want a robot hand >.<
/me glomps Sumica into Luna
Oh and he left
yay John Williams
07,01See you all hopefuly soon again
JOHN WILLIAMS YOU ARE A GOD
sumerpan is lurking
now back to trying to debug my router. :/
Luna: may the force be with you
Luna tomorrow?
PinkiePieYoshi64: yeah but oh well, I had fun at least. it was the best birthday present evar :3
/me Slaps pony_7007 "BAD! IT'S STAR WARS! 10/10!" :[
hey SlurryMoon are you going to play the family guy ep for empire strikes back now?
Hey guys :)
seeya Luna
Oni_link ;) :D
SUMMERPAN
Ponies47: Mass Effect > Star Wars. Umad?
Hey Hec-3rm
Imperial March :O
SlurryMoon: HISHE next?
WalkerPony89: hes not
WalkerPony89: Nope.avi :P
YEAH IMPERAL MARCH
/me force chokes WalkerPony89
WalkerPony89 I aint even mad.
WalkerPony89: BUT I AM
08,01Wrath of Khan > Star Wars
DIS SONG
Is this another starwars thingie again?
Everypony MARCH TO THIS SONG!
Mass Effect's ending was sooooo good, guys
/me moves sumerpan to downloads
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
/me Marchs
UDNUDUDNDUNDUDNDUDNDUNDUDNUDNUDNDUDNDUDNDUNDUDNUDUNDNUDDNUDUNDUND
Imperial march is best march
^
if you notice throughout mass effect there is star war references
and then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Bronysith: Even with ME3's shit ending, ME is still better than Star Wars hands down ;)
xD
PinkiePieYoshi64: And they were working on # 3 but the studio in charge is ded too
08,01still a better love story than Twilight.
^
/me shoves a lightsaber in WalkerPony89 where the sun dont shine
Also, Golbez is best Darth Vader
I am just imagining the lyrics for this song as the word sumerpan said over and over again.
Star Wars/Star Wars :P
That ending totally isn't canon. Bioware has lost their rights to their own canon.
still cannot beat KOTOR ending or for that matter the seguel
Barbetos: ikr
Is this an intro or credits?
11,01But the empire won in ME.
oni_link not sure why though
08,01Bronysith: i'd tap that.
So whats next family guy pardoy?
Quick_Thinker: kotor 1 is the best star wars game
Hec-3rm: it's the ending credits
but KOTOR 2 is also good
/me deflects Bronysith's lightsaber with his buns of steel and uses biotic slam on Bronysith
k
Let's see here, if there's one video I'd like to suggest, I'll just msg it to SlurryMoon
Yeah I think it's just Family Guy next
Empire at war is 2nd best star wars game!!!
Barbetos: just because it was there and moving on beat :D
WalkerPony89: lightsabers can cut through steel dumbshit
08,01Lunar_Brony: i'd tap edward cullen
WRONG THRACKER ZOD
3I'm not taking suggestions today
Bronysith: Not this steel! xD
3I'm too tired
Slurry told me he's not feeling well tonight to run much else
KOTOR AND KOTOR 2 are best ones
I've read all of the twilight books
Oni_Link SWBIII was indeed cancelled, but the people who took over (yes there were some who took over) stripped it all out, and so SWBII Became SWB Republic Commando, or whatever was the lasted Handheld release
/me force implodes Quick_Thinker
We're gonna be watching Somthing Somthing Somthing Dark Side and my brother is gonna watch it on TV! :D
I don't think I have ever seen a movie where the Empire is good.
SlurryMoon: Family Guy Star Wars next I take it?
3I'm just going to stream family guy and then call it a night. I might play a game if there's enough time. We'll see.
do i have to smack somepony....
/me force imploeds WalkerPony89
SlurryMoon aww, and I just found the perfect song to get streamed here
oh well
night everyone
Okay thank you SlurryMoon :)
KOTOR AND KOTOR 2 are best ones
08,01Lunar_Brony: edward cullen is the vampire from twilight... honestly, if you've not read/seen it, you shouldn't deride it
better than G3, amiright?
Cheers for Star Wars :D
SlurryMoon: Sounds good :3
yes
Quick_Thinker: just kotor 1
Rank Film Laboratories? I wonder if it stank to work there. Get it? Get it? hah cuase.. its rank... And... yeah
yay....
Alright. Thanks for streaming anyway.

PinkiePieYoshi64: I never followed up after SWBII so i wouldntt know :P

Maidorkid you can get wallpaper changers for Windows. Windows 7 has it pre-installed, you have to install it for XP, and I'm not sure about Vista yet. I'll check, though
my roommate's playing Slender in his bedroom. I can hear his reactions. It's even better then an episode of Rage Quit

I thought you took over the stream, Sumcia.
The stream died?
Yup
08,01the guy e-mailed me back and was *demanding* financial information, and other stuff
08,01so i passed him over to our treasurer
Aww no more talking?
08,01who sent him a rather purple, but to-the-point e-mail saying that we wouldn't disclose our financial situation
Yeah :(
08,01he then sent us this really really rude e-mail back
Alpha-Omega I'm still getting stream
Lunar_Brony: Refresh
08,01saying "zomg your e-mail was so pretentiious, i hope you convention is a shitfest, you're waht's wrong with this fandom"
Lunar_Brony: You're probably a few seconds behind
08,01and it ended in "and by the way, i'm the person who made the lyra plushie!"
LOL
08,01you know, thinking it would piss me off
Are we hearing another "Satowned" story? :3
08,01and i'd be all irate and blargh about it
13>"you're what's wrong with this fandom"
Shizuka: ?
13>"btw i made the lyra plushie everyone's appalled by"
13wut
Shizu: EXACTLY my thoughts
Lunar_Brony: do they have the wallpaper changer for vista?
Shizuka umm . . . okay
hehe, I'm drawing a Shizukorn :3
Lunar_Brony: I know that feeo bro. Mine's never THAT far behind though
Alright, who would have bought that plushie but NOT have used in sexually?
3night
Shizuka: pony logic, it doesnt have to make sense :P
08,01my reply: "i think your plushie is one of the best things to happen to the fandom in a long time. here's why" and i linked him the imgur album of alternative uses for the plushie
Gnight Slur

Polydunami|DW: you dont know :O
08,01he actually admited to me that he hated the brony fandom, and made that plushie as a troll
hai everyone ^_^
sushi corn and a late 90s hard rocker?
Polydunami|DW it's Not Safe For Woona, yes
Polydunami|DW: Yes, it is. Doubt I can say how w/o geting banned, but yes, it's very NSFW
Hi OneTrickPony
13nopony links it or gets a pool noodle to the everything
Polydunamy|DW: The Plushie has a hole beneath the tail that you put your "pencils" in
Right, just wanted to know.
the plushie is Not Safe For Woona
Shizuka: O_O
13well Korn was a band
So that I can stay far far away from it.

Shizuka: Kinky...

Ah, feed is over?

Works for me
Shizu: I've seen enough swimming pools to know where that's going.

13oh nothing
Shizuka: please don't send that to me

Shizuka: I can't stand noises like that and scraping sand and crunching ice it hurts my ears something awful...
I sense much wub in that picture
13so on an unrelated note Maruchan makes box lunch style ramen now, like cup noodles except more of it... quite delicious

Hmm.. wish I had some instant Yakisoba righ tnow..
