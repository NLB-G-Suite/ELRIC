back
11,01Vordox: 2.
11,01Did that in my head.
Some say 2, some say 288
288
Some say 288 and some say 2.
yup that is 2
I texted my Ex Bf
It's just a "Left to right" or "PEMDAS" issue
11,01I see.
11,01The way it's written creates confusion.
how does it create confusion? always follow BODMAS
anyone that doesnt is wrong
no i mean BODMAS
11,01Some see it as 48/(2(9+3)). Some see it as (48/2)(9+3)
I thought it was 2
I told my ex bf that its ok cuz a much hotter boy asked me out a week ago ;)
11,01Pi is exactly 3!
Brackets, powers Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
but its 48 / 2(12)
MATHS!!! IT BURNS
Bye guys :)
PEMDAS: 9+3=12 12*2=48 48/12=2
*steals TticieMuffins *
Oo
It's Multiplicative BEFORE Division
get out
really is this still on?
blasphemer
multiplication, and addition/subtraction are actually equivelant
but enough math for now: i'll just enjoy the song...
doesnt matter which way you do them
Math! :)
But...
because a division can be written as a multiplaction
E=mc2
and a subtraction can be written as an addition
Uhm, guys.... school's been done with. Can we not have a math argument please? :$
^
BODMAS not BMODAS
you stop learning
gunna find sumting else to do then, i'll never get the point of music concerts
whats the point in carryiing on
bye
brb
school never over? FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
We don't need no education
ok, time to get all this gf bf talk out of my head. to tf2 i go! see ya everypony! :)
but seriously, enjoy education while you can
We don't need no forced control
^
the lessons where easy
befroe i go arnold shwartzaneggar rage

where each calculation is done in order
rather than evaluating the actual equation
let math be, it hibernates during summer
Trust us
Hello everypon3
Fuck yeah
what's on?
HAHAHA I gotta remember this
yup
back
treat with caution
and wikipedia is a TERRIBLE place to get information from
wat
11,01I strayed away from Wikipedia during my thesis.
No it's not. >_>
Wikipedia is pretty stable for most things
its not 100% though
RE..You guys lied to me...there is a beautiful world outside my flat!
wut?
Wikipedia is usually the only place I can find info on something. and its really accurate.
and more and more education authorities are penalising the use of it
But, again, there's also this: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2Fb%28c%2Bd%29
Because they know if you say "Wiki is okay", that's all you're going to use.
me :)
No, seriously, can we take the teacher's word on this? Wiki is not a bad source. XD
11,01Wiki isn't bad.
It's just not the ONLY source you should use.
its community authored
Wikipedia has answers, but the answers are pre made, not something self made <--- This is the issue
11,01But I'm not putting my trust in it.
Run, run run run run run run run run run run
it doesnt take much to find a page and change it
and wikipedia lets ANYONE author it
11,01Chrysalis: They do fact checking and moderation.
Hi everypony. What's on stream
they react to changes
they dont pre-screen
11,01Chrysalis: That is the thing.
how are people italisizing their text? I don't see it anywhere.

Oh sorry, that's not me. I instantly presumed it was me because all the weapons
Seems about the amount I'd carry when I go shopping

yeah, that
wut?
08,01is that a good or a bad thing?
I'm lost
Saturn: depends on how you play

the last instrument I played was a ukelele, and that was a disaster. I'm sticking to my singing
08,01ah, okay

Saturn: glad i could be of assistance :)
i haven't played any instruments

Except for spiders. Spiders are cool.
Fair enough.

Spiders because of their 8 legged frame, they fall into the arachnid group of organisms
What're we watching?
Speaking of "bugs" as you easterns call them, I have a "bug"ger on my moniter now which I'm gonna shoot with a flamethrower

MOPPIT
Beep Boop son, Beep Boop
11,01Why didn't they spam probe droids in the first movie?
Hmmm. I have mixed opinions about Star Wars.
They should have sent lots of them like in Shadows of the Empire or Rouge Squadron
Dat Stopmotion animation
00,10there went lucas's raiting
It's got some neat moments and it's a fun universe but I don't really care about it.

i was only joking. :D
That's it, the Rebels are there, And I'm sure Pinkie Pie is with them >.>
Did they say HUMANS?
Piett did that on purpose

Dun dun dun
Does anyone have an album with all the "Buffering" pictures?
Soon enough we'll have a entire slideshow of buffer images
Dat choke
then porn
you have failed me for the last time...
11,01That's a long reach.
inb4 ded
suddenly field promotion
ded
best yet worst premotion
00,10You have faile me again, for the first time for the last time.
As long as Vader can see you, you are DED
I like those guy's costumes though
Need a cleanup i=on Section 3.
Ded. Move along.
implied execution
oh look, it's the other woman in the universe
Being able to forcechoke the people on TV. It would truely be a coveted power.
i like dis scene
this battle is epic
send in the impractical war machines!
I loked this map, I always played Battlefront with my Friends :)
pew
xD
Star Destroyer fail
Imperials forgot their shields.
08,01boob... laser?
/me cheers
08,01i don't like the sound of this...
11,01The first toilet has flushed.
wat?
titguns
Saturn: you'll see
inb4 he ded
00,10better idea, keep disabeling them with ion cannon shots till they fall out of orbit
Ions should be easier to shield against. Dat charge to mass ratio
i remember playing this map on starwars battle 2
dem assualt rifles
Oh. This isn't those 3 additional Star Wars films I've been hearing rumors of, is there?
thats a huge bitch!
Hear that? Daks got this one guys.
this reminds me of Battlefront II
I mean, there are still only 3, right?
we need a bigger gun
08,01oooh
ATAT <3 :D
brb
dem AT-ATs
08,01so *this* is where that pinkie pie thing came from in Anthology 2
all terrrian sumthin suthin
Those are the most impractical anti-ground units ever designed.
Echo Station 5-7 we're on our way
:D
Saturn: you didn't know?
lol yep
Saturn uh, yeah
This should be fun
thats like WW1 Trail-Wars, Rebels are germany and Emperium are English with Tanks :P
Ductape Cannon? Deal! :)
Star wars? looks a little like 2142
08,01i've only seen IV and I
08,01i've got all 6 of them on my hard drive
the two legged varient, now THAT'S impractical
Saturn: WATCH THEM DAMMTI!
I fondly remember this mission in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.
it aint strong enough for a lightsaber tho
00,10sweep the leg
08,01in fact, the ones we're streaming are the ones i supplied
08,01but i've never gotten round to watching them
ded
08,01and i missed half of this one because i'm meant to be working
gotta go repo an AT-AT
well, hes fried
Applejack was a rogue? :O
did he ded?
Sadly, she didn't make it :'(
Thinking on it, are those walkers even stratigically wise?
11,01AT-AT keeps on going.
legs are just silly
i think the 4 legs woud bypass any "ice slippage" issues
Or are they just for eye-candy and looking baws?
pewpew pewpew
AT-AT dont give a fuck
11,01Flying low there.
yeha
One does not simply stop AT-AT.
Duct Tape Cannons, HASSHA!
THIS IS IT!
and slow speed
>four legs prevent ice slippage
theres the problem with a mech
i remember doing this in battlefield. solo.
>a simple metal tow cable can trip them up
Seems legit
maybe they just should have gone with the wheeled design on this one...
*battlefront
Dat trip
Mommy, I want an All Terrain Armored Transport for ma birthday :D
DED
legs don't move..
It NO EXPLODE
booom
How did that even blow it up?
Boom.
Before it was a problem
Well how is it NOW they breach the armor???
Armor weakened by fall?
How is it being down going to make a difference!?
/me Holds Knee, "Ahhhhh,,, feeeee, Ahhhh"
Head made of explodium
They shot the neck, which was a weak point
They shot the weak point for massive damage
Yes, it makes no sense for it to be destroyed by one shot after falling. It's armor was friggin' intact!
lol
11,01Did I see a Skype window fly by?
the only reason this battle went as bad as it did is cuz "attack pattern delta" means "Fly straight at them in the only direction their guns can actually hit us"
Dat AT-ST
dat Snowtrooper
boizzz
Scootawalker
Rogue II!!!! :O
Scootallo Walker is best walker
It just buffered for me again. Anyone else?
NOOO!!!!!
11,01Nope.
pew pew pew pew
not my favourite character :(
Anyone that doesn't get a lot of buffering?
not wedge
GOIN' DOOOOWWWWNNN!!!
Wedge Antilles doesnt die iirc
no, Biggs and Wedge survive ALL three movies
Biggs died...
Biggs bought it in the first one
They did this in tiberian sun too!
Wdge is only non main to make it
NO!
NOT BIGGS!
lol
NO DAMMIT NO!
R.I.P. Biggs
lol!
And kicked.
Get me closer! I want to hit it with my lightsaber!
weeeeeeee
first*
Now THIS is a weakspot
EPICNESSSSSSS
Frag out
right in the 'nads
yes it isn't a movie night without me getting kicked.
Lightsaber + Bomb = Massive Damage
a massive weakspot
it was pregnant!
Boom
noooooooooooooooooaaaa*smash*
EPIC
Did I just see an off-the-shelf explosion?
Well to be fair, that's the easiest way to take out a tank. Open the hatch, use a grenade, GTFO.
/me pats otakon's back "Only you're qualified to take that much kicks and live, man."
BOOM!!!
Darth Vader, you are clear for landing :D
Two down, one from a HAND GRENADE. That's money well spent.
My head would explode to, if i was hit in the balls with a lightsaber
C3PO can run?
:D
ATAT are probably chinese and dont cost much, they just spam em and win like now
Treaded vehicle would have same grenade vulnerability.
:O
oh wait
HEIL VADER!
DUN DUN DUN
11,01Darth Vader has switch sides.
:O IT'S DARTH VAPOR! ...I mean Vader
Snowtroopers: Like Stormtroopers, but with more KKK-like helmets
see the co-pilot? secretly he's singing the ants go marching
There goes my apprentice
Hurry, before Vader realizes he built you, and uses his root password.
Dat engine stall cliche
It's Lord Helmet:O no, wait...
Lol
11,01They shouldn't have worked on it.
EAT LAZOR TIC TACS
