we haven't nailed down entirely what element it is yet
I'm desperate
Heard that too.
I should listen to this album again, it's awesome.
but we know this: it's a lively one, and it does NOT like the human skeleton
:D
So I usually wind up learning the right hand portion for a song, and the left hand portion rots away because I can't seem to get my hands to play them both at the same time.
brb, sorry but I've seen this "way too much, I need a moment"
so many ponies like Portal!!! :D
Razyn you messed it up
I agree DSNesmith, I mean, it's great. But we watch this at least 3 times every brony movie night
They're like…tied somehow.
Hmm. What console game should I play?
Portal is cool, that's for sure.
We have seven days for ponies and this event: http://www.qwipster.net/ring.jpg

Patterns, even in chaos systems?

EqD marathon...?

Octavia: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6467881/
I think TF2 is alright
>mfw I know this song from anthology, and not from Chicago
ohhhh the good old days of being an animation major...
It's so that those who play them are "MATURE" enough to understand that it shouldn't be done in real life.
eqD marathon? What?
/me nostalgias

Seems like tiger is occupied

You know i like donkeys.

lol death note
/me <3 donkeys
DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA
LMAO!!!!
best clip in anthology

neat donkey
LOL.
So fortunate it is a donkey. Ya know...since "Mules are ugly". Rarity's words not mine. XD
:D
I TAKE A POTATO CHIP...AND EAT IT
Lol
my company pays for me and a few others to go to Siggraph every year
/me has a stuffed donkey he made back when he was in school
Mules != donkeys
so I always try to stock up on animated shorts then :P
I watch a lot of 'em actually. Film Brain, Phelous, Todd in the Shadows, Spoony, JesuOtaku, Cinema Snob, and occasionally Nash. Though the flamewar on one of Nash's vids has put me off him.
/me has no idea what Siggraph is, but it sounds delicious~
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
Ah Siggraph
If you play Deathnote backwards its about a guy that revives everyone with his magical book
Mules are not donkeys
^
it's a new-age technology convention
Darf, LOL
film brain can be entertaining
Mules are Donkey/Horse hybrids.
hehe
Wee-snaw
I Ran justifies all the dumb shit from the '80s, imo.
people show off their up-coming software
by erasing their names with a pencil
and hardware
If you play Momento backwards, it makes complete sense.
second time my flash player has crashed
"Student #159... Please write normally..."

If you play the MLP gens backwards it goes from supremely awesome, to utter crap, then slowly improves.
Alone in the Dark!
Triple flip mc-twist
derpy's eye condition means she see's more at once than we do
anyone else remeber this show?
Siggraph is just really popular with CG design and whatnot
Are you Afraid of the Dark
I loved this show.
we haven't watched moonbase alpha pmv in AGES
i loved that show
we try to get our booth close to Autodesk every time :P
this is both good and bad
I LOVED this show
Snap, I just got the chills
SHE SEES ALL
If you play Rocky Horror backwards, it's about a couple who gradually become less and less sexually active until they eventually leave their friends and watch a couple get divorced.
Haha

how do they work?
lazytown + ponies
>.>
hah
Fucking Magnets, how do they work?
awesomeness
Solo should know
whatever happened to Lazytown, anyway
if you play power rangers backwards its about giant monsters who shrink
If you watch FIM backwards, it's a about a group of friends who, after unleashing an unspeakable evil on the world that eventually disappears, all grow distant from one another until Twilight Sparkle leaves to study with Celestia.
Hrmm?
lol if I hit mah skull hard enough with a finger it maykez funneh sound :D

Indeed it does :)

I've got an Asus G53-JW
Even though that's what my MacBook Pro is running on :P
its better than that opne
mostly
But jk, it's something right?
and yet, no songs are named
I keep trying to upgrade
and failing miserably
okay Never Say Never
first I bought RAM that my motherboard didn't have room for
Anything by the beatles
I'm looking for the CMC have you seen them?
anything by pink floyd
Lets start with Ok Go. This Too Shall Pass
then I bought the wrong kind and got the tiny laptop sticks online
!moon spin
Grab my tail, MrMooMoo!
anything by simon and garfunkle
then I tried to return them
I'm still fighting with NEwegg over that
anything by dragon force
Bon Jovi
bleh
Anything I randomly make up on the spot and/or sing in the shower
0dat lyra
Always check if the RAM is compatable with the mother board
anything by OK go
I did that about 2 years ago lol, I bought 2GB of the wrong kind of RAM for my laptop.. never bothered to get an RMA for it.
all lack analogue synthesizers
yeah that was dumb of me
and are immediately unworthy
So?
I dunno how I misread the description so badly
It happens though.
If a band requires synthesizers
Asus P5QL/EPU Mobo, 6gb RAM (@1066mhz) 1gb ATi Radeon HD 5670, Intel E47000 (shitty) 250gb SATA 7200 Primary, old IDE 80gb secondary.
they suck
if a band requires guitars...
automatically
Everything would sound better with a B3 solo.
this band has none
0Ha. Alex S apparently is going to be remixing Adventure Time songs now, too.
At Reaver :O

anything played using lightning as the insturment is better
for the DS or somehting
^ none of you can top this ^
How about Fighting is Magic
with sprites
because, thats damn awesome
solder*
would be so awesome
Video games based off of TV shows and movies usually flop, you know..
07So we need Rocky Horror PMVs!
special thinks goes out to Jesus for holding off that Rapture!
TrollightSparkle, it's not that great. Well, fuck it. I just need a better CPU.
07Who is up for the challenge?

It's over!!
2,14 I would be, but I have enough on my plate atm :P
not me, I no know how to edit
I still have that vid XD
Needs more Equestriaonline

A sort of adventure-game-kinda-thing like Story of the Blanks would work well if they put enough effort into it, IMO

TrotRot: true
2,14 OH YES

2,14 it's called "The End"
how horrifying
Oh shit.
Ten seconds in
What am I watching? Tis' creepies.
D:
I am digging this so hard.
Equestria Online is on a well pace so far.
french pastries?
Is this the rejected version of 9?
Oh my god.
UM NO
this is reminiscent of 9
This looks like something off of Courage the Cowardly Dog IMO
what was the name of that the previous video?
dat herdmind
inb4 herdrage
*walks into Stream*
I love 9
........................
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:07h:47m:44s
9 was seriously underrated
the story was a little bland
So far things have been going well on developing and whatever the other ponies do.
mib_7thgm4 It was called Ponies the Anthology
WTF IS THIS?
well, this looks boring, I'm off to write for a bit, be back once I hit 16667 words
Oh this is a short where a Magpie befriends a Scarecrow
but the animation and characters were fantastic
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Hoennshy (Update Part 10!) (http://tinyurl.com/5r8qkgr)
But what am I looking at?
6...we're not in Kansas anymore...
Pokerface.
oh fuck oh shit fuck aaahhhhh
I dont even man...........
Everything needs more B3 solos, like if you write a song and it doesn't have a distorted B3 solo, you need to rewrite it.
I still need to watch 9, it looked cool.
This is going to give me nightmares isn't it
ty
Bah, Fiddlesticks...
this is kinda freaking me out
9 was boss
Is this like that episode in which the Doctor becomes human in 1913 and there's the Blood Family?
I have headphones.
and the characters were great
Oh god oh man oh god oh man
Scarecrow is failing at his job
I never finished 9. I got bored
TURN IT OFF!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDKKq-_4ANU
FAILCROW
Scarecrow court?
2,14 You will take the culture and you will like it!
have fun with that one
socrates never even approached the fundamental truth in the above statement
I understand this story?
alright
I haven't even watched 9, I want to but still
hey, I was right!
0slenderman?
in 40 minutes
07:p
aponymous it's alright, I was hoping for more, and the story...kind of needed some work.

They are accusing him for befriending a scarecrow.
Officially creeped.
07only sometimes?
07:D
You do it.
okay okay, all the time :P

SCARY AS FUCK
MY LITTLE SCARECROW: FRIENDSHIP IS ILLEGAL
wtf am i watching?
So hes supposed to care the crow
GO BACK TO KILLING INTERNET DRAGONS
You have the understand the story just by actions.
Porn?
Just a guess
9 looked cool. It had good world-setting. But the story itself. . .
Dude, this Flower Travellin' Band sounds awesome.
And petting one is illegal
Is the rest of their stuff like this?
yeah don't watch 9 for the story
hell yeah *highfive*
I'mma go.
it's very simplistic
somebody
yeah for the most part, they broke up in 73
wtf am I watching

So he go beaten and punished?
grr

I wish more music had B3s.
This is really what scarecrows do when you are not looking

Mordecai! GO AWAY.

Unless he was a total dick.
rock music, real loud
Was he a total dick?
ARCHIMEDES
lolwtf.
Is that live action or just really good animation?
lol he had dreadlocks
apologies...?
NO U, Rigby
Lol DSN

It will help him escape one straw at a time.
2,14 it's CG :P
have you ever seen a dreadlocked dick
Not only will it keep you up, it'll keep your neighbors up too
0__0
They're not on Spotfiy!
oh I SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
This ruins EVERYTHING.
Im not understanding this.
scarecrows freak me out
How did i get banned for that long?
My little scarecrow, my little scarecrow, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...... Myyyyyyyyyyy little scarecrow! I used to wonder what friendship could be! But now you rot in jail with me!
this is like when you tie a rat to a dog's neck
What.. what the eff.
BIRDS WHY U HATE ME?
Scarecrows killed him.
to make the dog go crazy
and hate rats
THEY KILLED HIM.
so that it'll kill them
Man, that bird is a jerk!
they're training him to hate crows
naw he's still movin.
No more auto rejoining?
Dead Space has nothing on this kind of creepy. *shivers*
i friggin hate scarecrows
Is this the prequel to The Wizard of OZ?
07I hate clowns...
Im not intimidated.
07Brrrr
I GET IT NOW~!
I really need to play some Dead space man....
damn scarecrows, you scary
07IT...
Me too Luna
this is reminding me of an old Soilwork Video
07Never again
he's going to be a finely tuned crow scaring machine at the end of this
or dead
Ah, he didn't KILL HIM?
not sure which
Lol Luna I know..
Ugh, me too Luna
Oh...that bird is smart....I take back what I said
HE refigured him outside!
:D
/me shrugs
Knew this would happen :/
He either escaped or rotted into the concrete
awww
I just got banned and unbanned lol
It doesn't rejoin for me
NOT CUTE STILL HORRIFYING
Dannnyyy

Nice Bird.

yesssssmahsummah?
Okay!
scarecrow*
and then he was gunned down.
6,0Is this Slenderman? o:
so the moral of the story is:
No.
No
befriend birds
Freeedommm!
/me blows a loud horn in SummerRains ears
and if you are ever imprisoned
A single tear was shed.
Still creepy as hell
they will rip you apart
You didn't get banned, you got kicked
Now he's an escaped criminal.
well, that was dull.
betta?
I don't get what happened. :0
and piece your corpse together outside
birds are awesome
No, banned
Manly tear was almost shed.
Almost.
No more !mooning people for the commeners?
That was pretty cool.
Alfred Hitchcock is crying.
What was that called?
No, I did actually tempban him
2,14 The End
I thought it was cute.
0That was interesting
With good reason.
Spanish?
oh
I don't get it.
Fin.
The moral is to trust your friends, they will lead you out in the darkest of times c:
That's a really great short film
lol dat google result
you would do well not to draw attention to yourself by talking about --enderman so much
did it take him apart and take him outside?
He doesn't listen when he's kicked because of auto rejoin.
French.
ZEE SHADENFREUDE
2,14 there, you all may now say that you are partially cultured in my eyes :P
NO NOT LUNA!
what is this autorejoin?
I need to find a karaoke version of the "Hush, Now Quiet, Now" scene.
oh god, this does not bode well
Oh, I listen. But I don't like it heh
Or I should say, he never learns.
note to self, be friend a bird and it will get you out of jail by removing your parts and assemble them out of the prison
oh man
Uh

oh, never mind, that's alright then.
I was already cultured.

/me glares menacingly at Trot_Rot.
I have SO MUCH material for that
Cant wait till PMVs have more luna footage to use
I want to see that play.
I'll be avoiding Season 2 PMVs when I watch them here, they'll seem brand new.
I know exactly what you mean
You know you mean in a sexual way
what's the action on betting on how long til we get a new PMV after S2 premiere?
2,14 10 minutes

Damnit, I should've mentioned inb4 10 seconds flat joke :/

!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s

I need to ask Twilight about that one.
!plot
Twilight told me this video is about I WAS FROZEN TODAY
*wigglewiggle*
HOLY *&^%
I'm suprised there hasn't been one with the twelve seconds of total S2 footage we have already

Aaaw

Whatever sounds intresting
Here's a game for you guys

Lmao
I'd still hit it
Seriously anyone hear of Alestorm? or am I alone :(
it is 'her' darkest secret
Fluttershy, you Slut
Mostly sad stuff, tends to have feeling and development
Fluttershy, she likes to **** Rabbits
Alestorm is awesome
Some people are paid to write, there's a reason why the people who aren't paid to write aren't paid to write.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybSGMkqWbQ <-- every time they say "Chuck Norris", take a shot. See how quickly you get drunk.
Charge!
The Fluttershy ones are fucked up.
Shitting Rainbows
Spin: Saw them with Korpiklaani a couple years ago.
It was awesome.
They don't want to?
I'd be in jail or juvy or something cuz im underage
Fluttershy has quite a mouth on her
Lordlyhour: Yes, yes they are
they'd rather write fanfics?
I've heard of Alestorm
No Lordlyhour, because they're bad writers.
Haha
;_;
if a bear rainbows in the woods, and nopony is around to hear it, does he still play seashells?
Som are, some aren't
6lol Magnet
*bleep* at the Ghosties?
Magnet's my fav part
Not everyone who doesn't have writing as their paying job is bad
You really need to read something before you dismiss it offhand
hahahah

LOL.
Epic.
the muzzle flash makes it
oop, her it comes
no, the bear is too busy collecting beach volleyballs
/me trotts off to his room for the night

Scales = Guns, best solution
You are grouping everyone into a single classification
/me defends Fluttershy with a weapon of deadly nature
Twi is always saying shit
So what
what's with you and falling off shit today?
10 shots? Challanege accepted.
Dragon scales can be fashioned into armor and gun shrapenel.
You;ve read every fic on EQ daily?
that one sucked
*** Yourself!!
Oh wait...I'm not of age yet. Not till the 17ths.
or at least one by every author?
No Lordlyhour, I have standards so I can't read that much shit.
YOU LITTLE ****
Lol?
oh, man, applejack's worst element demonstration ever
Aj did what to her?
Did you not try limiting it to the stuff rated 6-Star
?
dat futashy
13Who *beeped* me when I was in doubt!
Then you can;t say that every fic is shit
6-5 star only
Classic
6...Fluttershy that slut.
LOL
anyone afraid S2 premiere will be as cheesy as the S1 one
Man, these ponies are players
because you haven;t chanced it and found one you like
*poop
TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHAF-
RD did nothing
Kinda, DSN
lol
Boom.
lol
13Haha
This is what happens when you give a teenager admin rights.
2,14 honestly I don't think S1's premiere was that bad...
worried that it'll be more a repeat than anything else
I recomend Spiderses as a startingfic
I'm 27, smartass.
He's not a tenn
*teen
13Luna <3
2,14 but hey, I'm a sucker for in show songs
Hello
lol
Haha
DSNesmith I think it'll be alright, now that we have a better handle on the characters, if they do something like that it'll feel less forced
lol
Teenager isn't really an age, it's more of a mindset.
LOLOLOL
hopefully
13Take a shit please
And, Pizzicato, did not try limiting it to the stuff rated 6 & 5-star
And Spikes' Constipation was solved...FOR-EVERRR
!
I was very meh towards the premiere when I first saw it
but it's grown on me
WOO
Funny story.. I was like this is okay when I first watched S1 Premiere.. next thing I know, there goes Episode 15 :P
Pizzacato probably not best idea to be a dick to admin..
PA PA AMERIKANO
Damn she even tells you when you can go to the can.
I didn't think it was bad, so to speak, just... not that great
Well it takes one to know one, Pizzicato.
Then we're all teenagers
all right, I better call it a night
Got rehearsal tomorrow
ooh
I know this song
burn
Agreed, I watched 15 my first day.
Using the base form Fuck,shit stack?
13Wtf lol
the video is disappointing
but the song
... next
plus the first 2 episodes were originally meant as the season finale, so it should still be like later S1
Spin, he's just some guy, you know?
was on the techno station out here all the time.
Hell, if we're talking mindsets, I'm probably still a preteen
*Did you not?
Hi Mongoose
I'm a teenager so what?
this vid is.....ok
/me is really a teenager.
Quite
Cmon I hear that song too much.
XD
So, what time zone are you guys in? I'm in GMT -5 (East Coats US)
^
Is that... Brollywood?
east coast here
6,0Musical theatre as in showtunes?
GMT -6 here dude. Mountains :)
1:27
I'm also really a teenager
I'm east Coast
6,0I do as well. . .

I'm so used to this song now.
Or 7?
Mountain....oh curd TMI

okay Violet, here's your chance to earn my infinite respect

11:27 is the current Mountain time
1:28 here
13 12:28 here
UTC - 8
Now then on a more serious note, please learn some freaking manners. I'm sick to the back teeth of you using the term "I have standards" to dismiss anything and everything. It's possibly the most pompous and up-oneself thing I've ever seen someone say, and at your age you really should damn well know better. or is the message of love and tolerance preached by the who we are all a fan
like I said :P
of somehow lost on you?
do you know Parade?

Now who's the freaking immature teenager
Weird.

I like TIME. IT'S TOTALLY RELEVANT, BITCHES. :D
Cool, at least I am not the only Mountain time brony in these parts
there is a supernova that is reaching it's peak TODAY. Look online to see where it is and get binoculars or a telescope to see it
Why is this so awesome?
ok trippy
Quite
now I know why you wont read anything; you're illiterate
CLear enough?
I'm 16 and to be honest Pizzicato is acting like the idiots at my highschoolso much for mindset right/

Oh I like the 3D Trixie, its the best one
I think I'm going insane

.....
0Yes, the 3D Trixie was incredible

Oh I mix those two up... unless they are the same...
Oh do you Val?
Mongoose, just now?
Sorry to hear that ValtheJean

The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 3 million light years (ly) from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is catalogued as Messier 33 or NGC 598, and is sometimes informally referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy, a nickname it shares with Messier 101.
happen*
>from the creators of South Park
21 million lightyears away
I just said that
I've been so damn paranoid lately
I feel invisible
is the Pinwheel
oh so it must be M101 then
2,14 well, all I can say is aside from the difficulty of finding people who aren't ultra-conservatives, it isn't that bad
and 3 million could kill us with a supernova
and I've been having these crazy nightmares
i think
Im not sure whether to feel awesome or sad about that.
im paranoid
maybe not
so..
/me shrugs
every day

Ah South Park, always pissing off everyone, eventually they might attack the brony community
o.e
well, they've already shown they can do a musical with "Bigger Longer and Uncut"
bai bai gone fur nao.
I'm really bucking paranooid
PROBLEM GOD?

I've been paranoid about everything lately
IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME, BUT ERY EERIE
First, stop linking the same video
How was contagion?

that's a first I think
Next, do any of you know how not to lean on the enter key?

Yankovics himself approves.
But Im not tired!
hello?
I recommend it, but not to germephobes or people with very weak stomaches
Ali1017: I apparently do. My last comment in this chat was more than a half-hour ago ;)
dat flamebait
suddenly FPK thread
Ponyism is the best religion ever!
that's how much longer the post-show will be, then Luna's going to bed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grU8PPKP1Uk&feature=related
hiii
Danny: I am so sorry, i cant. I have somebody sleeping in the same room I am in and I cannot wake them or want to. I dunno about you, but I don't like to be waken up just to the carelessness of others.
But I love flamewars.
I like to type typity type type!!
im wasting time aah
/me 2,14 Readies his BanTrident
Hi ABC!
oh, well, you coulda said that.
:P
Modest Mouse
It lets know how real this "love and tolerance" is
Will someone steal the stream after luna?
I know all these songs :/
Hi, Soin!
*Spin
it wasnt 'til 20 minutes ago though
....... Same here reaver
I must be luna. Forever alone in the moon...
because at one point they peel back the skin off of someone's skull/face in an autopsy toward the beginning of the research against the virus
I do, TRixie
I do
Hey what's the name of the vid?
They would be at the door early every other morning rivets
6,0and my midi controller would play a part of my voice
Sounds like a song Weird Al would do
2,14 Love and Tolerance is as varied as every brony. And since it isn't a community-wide acceptance there is no reason trying to troll people who do
ah, Killers polka
2,14 so with that being said, NO trolling topics :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=V8fk-lo_EEI
no trolling?
HEY GUYS
WHO'S BEST PONY
lol
WOAH WOAH
btw, I'm excited because I finally got to the point where I bring in Trixie for my NaPoWriMo fic
Turtaguin, doesn't beat the stuff I have on my computer. Autopsies, Beheadings, Bullet wounds, Scalpings, etc.
13Ahhh. lol XD
that's awesome
Twilight Sparkle, nuff said.
Since when NO TROLLIN'!?
Anyone up for Ponysona?
0Fluttershy
Rainbow Dash is best pony DNS
how am i doing this?
o-o huh?
13That'd be... ugh. lol
So nobody told me the song name..
aww dada said no
doing what?
Anyone want the #moon? I really dont know what to do with it...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPLEOOSA!
13I'd prefer actual voices. :P
wow, all you guys keep misspelling Rarity, it's weird.
Haha wow I love the "i hope the didn't notice all the porn"
MOFO
whee
anyone read the Encyclopedia Dramatica article on bronies?
and everyone would think Violet is an artificial intelligence we created :P
it's amusing
lolwut does dat mean
Fluttershy is the best Pony ever!
0I was saying Fluttershy is best pony >_>
ITS THE FLUTTERSHY!
XD
6,0I know I know, I was kidding. . .
i have so much sleep i am pushing back right now
they list all the bona-fide trolling techniques
APPLEJACK IS BEST PONY.
then warn that none of them will actually work
The Appaloosa would be an interesting B-movie.
and i brush it off like it's nothing
Not me *ahem* Harity!!...oh wait
Ah... ><
FLuttershy is best, RD is coolest
i cant even blink
O_O
0_0
Stop teasing me Filter..
/me stares
Nope.avi
sorry...
I've been watching Pony videos all day today x_x
Rarity is best pony at everything because ART OF THE DRESS
So
/me apology hugs Moo
same here
amen to that
Pony overdose? No such thing.
I nearly had a heart attack like a minute ago
man, ponies are gradually consuming my life
it's great
2,14 there is never enough pony in the world
oh, and don't see it if you have a needle phobia or don't do well with edger allen po type storylines
/me accepts apoligy hug.
Its contagious
So much Pony 6_9
ah i had to restart my internet
Oooo…At the Gala
whys that roush?
Oh yah.... I remember this thing I need
Starts Troll Topic: AJ > TS > PP > RD > R > FS
I was channel surfing, went by Animal Planet
When Season 2 begins, the madness will spread even FASTER THAN BEFORE.
Still want my fave song...
Poe is among my favorite people..
same, dsnesmith
my dormmates keep giving me odd looks
13:P
YES
And saw a yellowish horse.
I love it
Sleep. That's what it's called.
YESSSS
/me spells apology wrong.
Ah this one
whenever someone walks into my dorm and sees my brushable collection
they get this awkward look
I think I'll go try this "sleep" thing
13I just think it'd be fun to do something similar to what most podcasts do.
I choked for a second because my mind immediately put Fluttershy on the TV
/me waits for the RD solo.
and try SO HARD not to mention them
I was like
dude, I'm 16000 words deep into a my little pony Fanfic about internet memes, Ponies have BECOME my life in between classes
it's hilarious
May all your dreams be filled with Pony
I love making people uncomfortable
Night all
OHMYGODFLUTTERSHYISREAL
And you yelled Fluttershy!
Ponies, Ponies everwhere
No
Fuck sleep.
Night herospirit
I had a throatful of water
Aww
it would be pretty fun
I TRIED to yell it though
I have this kinda thing that's called "insomnia", it conflicts with that "sleep" thing
Sleep is for the weak..
Hence the choking
Night herospirit
Don't mess with the Apple Family.
I would like statues of MLP, but not the brushable dolls
*yawns*
Aww.
Night herospirit
then began licking the screen?
my dad has wary looks for my Dinky Doo plushy, he hasn't said anything but you can tell he's disappoint
the brushables are kinda fun
10 million fluttershys. Just because.
naw
they're a little DIY
0dem horns
Sleep is for those without Caffeene
Lol
choking =/= heart attack
After recovering I realized two things
wut D:
I want plushies, nothing else.
fluttersad, because it's awesome
1: It was a horse, not a pony.
although rainbow's brushable is terrible
Cuddled the screen?
the hair is awful
I had 2 large mnt dews, like 32oz, this "sleep" thing just... doesn't seem very attractive to me
bah, I can only sleep when sunlight is beaming down
2,14 DvD/Blu-Rays for me
Best solo ever
i lost the tab with vinyl scratch
You have a Dinky Doo plushy rivets ?
Screw Caffeine, I have good stamina!
2: No matter how much I want her to be real, Fluttershy will almost certainly not be real
I want GOOD plushies, and Pins, and shirts
so is this at the gala slightly slowed down?
the instrumental version of this is better
speakin' of caffeine... ate 10 chocolate covered coffee beans at once now am super hyper again and have a head ache ><
Robotics
....
we will create
Rainbow Dash loves diamonds? That's weird
i wanted to make a reques
in an infinite universe, she is
with the EPIC dash guitar solo
Wow, to be a downer to yourself.
t
That wouldn't be quite the same
Japan.
*way to
another one
and no, this is normal speed
Only noobs stack Stamina Darf14 =p
almost all remixes speed it up
or... an infinite mutiverse, at least
yeah, I'm trying to get a pattern I like so I got a bunch of cheap grey felt to experiment on. a derpy pegasus and dinky unicorn is the result so far
6,0It would be. . .
Dang timer, slow down!
Mason: I realize that my fevered fantasies are almost never gonna happen...
if they ever release a derpy brushable
fluttershy, I ADORE CHOCOLte covered espresso beans!!!!!!!1
it will be mine in 10s flat
lol, inb4 mod musical podcast
But if they did, I'd be ecstatic.
it just feels slow compared to the orchestral version I usually watch.
Darn it Bronystate, Why U so awesome?!
DAMNIT clouds...
I set the bar really low so I'm almost never disappointed.
Turtaguin: They are the bomb :3
2,14 because we have ponies :P
we try, anon :P
After listening to so many remixes the original feels slow for me too
If they cancel this show after 2 or 3 seasons HEADS WILL ROLL
Meetoo
I regret stacking my stamina
and the walking animation that freaks me out
Turtaguin: but man do they make me hyper ><
Twilight's expectations for the gala were the least realistic.
Ohm this prancing is just so CUTE.
It works.
Once we have working Virtual Reality simulation pods that perfectly simulate fictional dimension and provide vital nourishment and stimuli to your physical body, ANYTHING can be real.
ooohh.....
I think pinkie was the most deluded
True
Unfortunately, that stuff probably won't exist for another 200 years
/me loves Into the Woofs
Woods*
I have all those shots on my background roatation
If it ever happens
dang
0To sell drugs
Awesome song
well night everypony
20 years
Also, what is RD supposed to be saying there? "Prove I'm great as a Wonderbolt is"?
A cartoon starring quadrupeds? That's different
I bet
!moon
when At the Gala first played...my face...it was like a lightbulb
To win!
Grab my tail, wolfinponysclothing!
Good night.
formal event? sing pony polka
yay
blarg?
?
get cryogenically freezed so you can be revived for that
What are we counting down until? o-o
My life will be split equally between being an amazingly powerful hero and living in Equestria
!?
dat latin japanese singing
No Ponies…?
a AMV?
german
WHAT.
Twilight has reasonable expects- but she knew studie not politics.
SUDDENLY CHANTING
2,14 until Luna goes night night
THAT'S NOT A PONY!!
Wait DCD requested somthing?
0>hino
"Royalty is going to ignore a huge party just to talk to ME! and noone else!"
Awwww.
Power Ranger or something?
0>Ankh
Nothing beats the power of imagination. I will take that over some fancy tech any day.
This is cool.
/me hugs Luna
reason Luna wasn't at the gala is because she was working
Celestia just has to raise the sun and be done with it
hugs luna
Dang, if I only have the TARDIS translator
Luna has to get all the stars and whatnot up
0I REQUIRE A LINK TO THIS
Kamen Rider?
/me hugs Luna
You can't cryo freeze yourself with today's technology. The resulting water crystals cause permanent damage to the organs, muscles, and blood vessels.
Kamen Rider. W?
Cool, But.... no its jsut cool
LUNA !!! Hi. :3 <3 I FRIGGIN LOVE YA
i dunno how much longer i can do this
Man, power rangers has gotten intense since i stopped watching.
Luna preferred to stay from the Gala at the moment.
yes OOO
is this.. a kamen rider amv?
/me glomps Luna
OOOS
Since everyone else is doing it...
/me hugs Luna
Wait, those are the dudes from OOO!
well we have games that can read your brainwaves, so if they could convert your thoughts to reality, I'd take that "fancy tech"
But you need something to touch and feel..
YUP
that hair, I'd recognize it anywhere!
That's one of the reasons the "Disney froze himself" rumor was debunked.
/me also hugs Luna
/me stomps Bug
Once virtual reality actually takes off I am going to envy the engineers and programmers. They will make a load of cash.
/me isn't sure how to emote in this chat
oh good that works
Course this is decades from now at best optimism.
/me reads Cupcakes for first time
You won't need cash.
:3
these lyrics are really awful, lol
so, what is up next
Can't be that bad...
Have a good time.
SuperBrony64 O_O
6,0What I would really like is to be able to perform, which I could do with my controller...
My progress on learning Japanese is going well, just about the only word I know off the top of my head is that "unmei" means "fate"
Inb4 letter spamming
but yeah, all we really need is approval from the "upper classmen" and then a few minutes to discuss organization
that story was pretty funny
Google VR...
I swear to god, I am addicted to caffeine, I cannot go to the movies without getting a large mnt dew, and I cannot start my day without a cappeccino, otherwie my movie is ruined, and my day is the shittiest that entire month, respectively
Superbrony64, I find cupcakes hilarious, just fyi.
ooooohhhh, that would be cool violet
0TAJADOOOOOOOR
Oh facebook, you never let me down..
reading cupcakes is a rite of passage now
/me is lying
If you could get a Virtual Reality pod to live in a simulated dimension of your choice, you can live in a perfect dream society.
07well Sprinks and I are here?
6,0Unfortunately I have to get that squared away...
07come up with some ideas
07:)
0Don't read cupcakes. I read it first time two nights ago. It's the worst thing ever.
Not sure why people find that funny.
well, basically what we've been talking about :P
Cupcakes, if anything, is something to laugh at.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrQ-NYIz54&feature=feedu semi- pony related (at the end anyway)
they try so hard
Some people even found Sweet Apple Massacre funny.
It's not even scary.
just get it over with
and move on
Cupcakes is very cool, as long as you read the alternate ending where it was all a dream
a podcast, or some sort of music related stream like "Guess that Tune"
Just ridiculous.
0It's not funny.
I think its so over the top I cant take it seriously
most epic kamen rider form ever!!!!1
I can imagine the social and economic effects when people would rather be in a viritual happy world over the real one.
I thought it was boring and obvious, tbh
I feel strange in that I've never felt creeped out by Cupcakes. It just seemed so ridiculous I couldn't be scared. Besides, I've sat through "A Serbian Film", compared to that most things are child's play
13>"upperclassmen"
/me is contemplating a pony blackout until Next brony movie night.
13Oh bleh
:P
I've heard about Cupcakes, what's Sweet Apple Massacre about?
The only reason I laugh at it is that fact it isn't even that interesting.
07oh lol
07did not read that
6,0I do not think having a radio would be our goal as there would only be pony music just like other sites...
I was gona go with "Supreme Overlords" :P
lol must be something involving Applejack
07was just responding :P
Indeed, it would present a terrible dilemma
Ken Park is worse than Cupcakes
but I figured the other was better
ITT: People diss cupcakes
Never heard of Sweet Apple Massacre
0No, it's not interesting. It's sick and depressing
haha, it's understandable Luna
Dont do it Tovler you will go in to withdraws like House
6,0Thank you for responding Luna
Ive read it over multiple times, not as bad as people say, it basically just explaining how pinkamina slices rainbowdashes parts off of her and making sure shes awake for all of it
you're actually, you know, doing stuff :P
Kamen Rider G. THAT'S awesome. And about wine.
07yep
I've also seen "I Spit On Your Grave". Compared to a 45 minute rap scene, Cupcakes is nothing.
6,0I for one welcome our pony overlords~
video game addiction? what? This is virtual reality addiction!
and how she does the same to to other ponies
TAKA KUJAKU CONDOR
07after this it's playlist
somepony feed me caffiene
I must find and read it...FOR SCIENCE!
Did someone mention earlier there was a Fluttershy Murder story?
I can see how if you've never seen a scary movie before cupcakes might hit you pretty hard, but I would have figured we're all adults and can handle a little gore
ah
07Well guys & girls
I can't blackout ponies, they have infected every spect of my life
07that was the post - stream
6,0And sleep... Glorious sleep...
Cupcakes was really over the top, TBH, and when I kinda realized that it's pretty much Arc 5 of Higurashi with ponies it lost all its impact
Yes Luna?
/me feeds SummerRain milk.
07putting on a playlist now
Oops
/me hugs Luna again
07hope you all enjoyed
Of My Little Pony?
Oh, I see. *hugs*
2,14 I think we should all take this time to show Luna our Appreciation
I STILL can't believe they remade I Spit on Your Grave.
0Bye Luna~
/me hugs Luna again as well
/me glomps Luna goodbye
WE LOVE YOU LUNA
/me takes a can of Black Mamba-flavored Venom and pours it down SummerRain's throat.
Thanks for Streaming luna
I wish I could have been here for the movies. :(
Bye Luna
0thank you, Luna!
/me hugs Luna shyly
Ya, the night is still young!
2,14 not only for streaming BMN every friday, but also for her wonderful pre/post shows, and of course, the House Stream :P
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Caffeine_3d_structure.png
Is that enough appreciation?
Luna's awesome! ;3
In truth, the simulations would have to be limited simulations. Restricted to X number of hours in a day, so people would still need participate in Reality, that way the world doesn't blow up.
WE LOVE YOU AND YOUR SOCKS, LUNA
THNX Luna
There's some caffeine.
Thanks Luna! We really do love you! (Except Valthejean, meany ace :D)
0THANK YOU LUNA!
Bye Luna!
/me gives luna an aloof, but still emotional fullfilling nod of the head
Bye Luna
2,14 HEY!@
Thanks Luna
tonight, I have 2 best friends
YES
1, caffeine for obvious reasons
thanks? XD
How can anything be more OOC than this?
Bye Luna
night luna
/me tries to consume
it isnt working
oh, this video again x.x
Good night Luna
but then people would complain that they own their virtual reality machine thingy whatever... and they'd want to be able to use it whenever.
ME: Yeah, I'm gonna get stuff done toda- PONIES: NOPE!
I'll be back guys.
It's true Kencolt.
you have to get a cup first silly
O.o
Go buy a can
I swear
..This song..
that stuff is powerful
:megusta:
but yeah, what are your thoughts on these ideas Luna?
2, hypercam for recording rocky horror for me while I was away :3
but it has to be USB compatible
Dang you ruin my childhood of sesame street.
Drink milk from my udders
07gimme a moment to read up
Ponies don't have free time for work or anything so why should we?!
yeah, if you haven't checked out Avenue Q yet, do yourself a favor and do that
I swear
07closing down some things
ah kk
Not theres anything wrong with that
That stuff is powerful
Who sings these songs?
...
Brain hurts.
best song in AvQ....
uhh....for some reason it sounds like a Sesame street song...ugh my childhood is dying
6All dis Avenue Q...
sucks to be me or Internet is fp?
Hiya Sprinkles
What SirSprinkles said.
2,14 Nikki and Bert, which is basically Bert and Ernie from Seseme Street :P
o_0
Darf14, it sounds like that to me too
What about Internet is for Porn? DSNesmith
I thought it was Bert and Ernie at first... haha
also SOFN!
6Hey Nat
mentioned it, crono :P
Jean, you READ MY MIND.
mY childhood as been MURDERED.
Looks like Avenue Q is done with puppets
it's a famous Sesame Street parody, and it is amazing
My childhood remains safe :3
Imagine: "Inception,
it is SuperBrony64
but craft a world of PONY
avenue q is strange
it's like
half puppets
half actors
What is this?
i <3 this song
^ just like Sesame Street
hero
I need a Herroooo!!
I like this song. What is it?
Oh, the mental trauma of actually leaving limbo would be immense.
Hero
Some kind of ...music?
except you can see the actors working the puppets, they're not hidden behind cardboard brick walls or whatever
hold on
by skillet
We just need that machene and connect it to every brony
Sumica: Yeah, I was checking out the official site for it. Looks like it's a Broadway musical
hero-skillet
Well I'm heading out, sayonara
oh it IS music
2,14 It is
The original song is Hero by Skillet.
Awesome to the pony degree
but some chars aren't puppets
brian's just a dude on stage
well I am going into a coma until such an invention exists..
2,14 it's actually a very clever show
lol
yep SuperBrony64 they also did the song the internet is for porn.
and "everyone's a little bit racist"
which is hilarious
Unless its on the cloud!
2,14 Plus, it has Gary Coleman as a character :P
why am I having evanescence flashbacks?
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Realistic Minecraft Animation Update
yo
Sumica: That's what I thought it sounded like lol
^ just like Sesame street, then, where a bunch of the characters are just actors and not puppets
RAWRity: You know why.
Yo.
6This PMV is very well put together.
really?
hey, there's ponibooru.org too?
I remember that time I won dinner for two in Mexico with GARY COLEMAN
2,14 it is a seseme street parody
honestly I haven't watched SS since I was 5
Blah, almost 2am for me. I should get to bed. Take care everypony.
I saw it when it was out here in Vegas
I remember nothing
HEY GUYS, AM I A KNIFE, OR A BANANA?
it loads surprisingly fast
Sleep well, SodapopFizz :3
2,14 it's literally Adult Seseme Street
If we don't destroy ourselves, some day maybe we will be able to bring the dead back to life to experience what they missed in technological advancements, and then somehow solve over-population...
I dont think i ever really watched Seaseme street. /:
the first couple episodes of classic Sesame Street were amazing
I have only the vaguest of memories of sesame street
Its been way too long since I saw SS, is it true that Cookie Monster eats veggies now?
same with Barney
it was more obviously about life in the NYC ghetto
I think they retconned that a bit
with cookie monster
2,14 yeah, and Burt and Ernie don't live together anymore
Is poniborru.com
?
but with technology to bring people back to life, I'm sure that society would be able to solve over-population easily
valthejean WHAT. BLASPHEMY.
what is borru for?
2,14 because people bitched that they were teaching kids that gay couples are okay
RUINED FOREVER
yeah, and Meowth is no longer with Team Rocket
Reaver021, are those the only two options?
Is the count still a pimp?
how would we solve over-population then?
I am legitametly high on caffeine, not just having ingested like <100 mg, like over 350-400 what should I watch/do????
Tolerance... how dare they!
*monicle* dam you over protective parents! DAM YOU!
yeah, how dare they insinuate that different lifestyles can be tolerated
lol turtaguin
My fellow bronies.
07alright.. so where should I start?
I require aid,.
tovler and my childhood is officially dead.
pack our bags, travel to mars :D
Yes?
Kill prisoners.
Yes Spose?
heya spose
......................
probably at "DO IT FILLY!" (lol j/k)
idk let people in the future figure it out. We wouldn't have the technology to solve it
Curse you college sleep schedule!
I have... a song stuck in my head...
Spose calls for aid!
MrMooMoo: Also acceptable
0Shoo shoo bee doo
I've been playing my xbox more often recently and I want to change my motto to reflect my new bronyism.
there's a thread about this on the forum as well
Is it the song that never ends?
Fluttershy: which song?
21 characters.
What is it this time, Fluttershy?
6EPIC PMV INCOMING
6...DAT RING
have yuo seen the new friendship is witchcraft?
THIS PMV
haven't seen this one before
what is this
backwards song of time from Majora's mask...
I can't think of anything to put.
yeah, and Team Rocket is competent and no longer stalking Ash.
Love and Tolerate?
^this
this is a good beginning...
Song of Healing reversed. THAT IS ALL
vaguely familiar
"Oatmean, y u serious?"
wait, if it ring does that mean the timer hit zero?
20% cooler.
oh hurray, actual lipsynching
and Brock is no longer on the show.
Love and tolerate is a good one. Like yours too FluffyWuffs.
timer hits 0 on the hour
Wow
Hmm…I liked Luna's Chrome theme with Applejack and want to put it on my laptop…but….then it would be on my laptop…which I bring to college...
No Brock? What the FUCK!?
I'd go with 20% cooler
da da da da da da da da...
ohhh, this is a combo of a few songs i think
Hey
yeah 20% cooler is the obvious choice
Your going to LOVE ME.
0SuperBrony64 do it filly
I tried putting 20% cooler. Didn't look right.
It is.
I do like good music...
yup
stuff like this always makes me cringe a bit, just because I'm not a fan of bring up sex in the same breath as ponies.
meh
What's wrong with bringing ponies to college?
:/
lol not sure if that will fit Mr.MooMoo
Katy Perry, oh, dear
~yay
Eeyup, give that part to Rainbow Dash
Why am I not surprised that RD's the one who showed up with that song?
Superbrony64, Fluant your Bronydom man!
SuperBrony64, bring the desktop and never give a fuck forever
Razyn Thanks Random Internet Stranger, I will do it now!
RD Confessed!
Night
seriously
And Ash is traveling with a cute black girl.
Dash, because of the fandom.
Good night
I was unsure about bringing my pony collection
night mongoose
hello
Night mongoose
I brought it anyway
no regrets
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irQ_d78feMA
night
Drink Milk!
poor bicurious dash, sounding vaguely like katy perry just seals your fate
^It's the PMV we're watching.
Well, imma go. Bye!
Hey there
>mfw you've already replied to the thread >.< *d'oh*
tovler I'm alright with this, I liked Isis in the games
Night R-Zack!
I'm still at Stage 3 of being a Brony :(
"get bucked!"?
lol fluttershy's face
Night Zack
euw
yeah, ponibooru.org is 20% faster
The Super in my name is all LIES
spin me round remix
er
cover
Night R-Zack
the orignal is way better
Iris is the cutest thing ever.
Yay.
NO MORE LAGGG
man my tping's getting worse thelater I stay up
but yeah, I've gone through DcD's guides, not sure if I actually got it right, but I at least have the software
wow
FLO RIDA CAN BURN IN A FIRE!
Ponibooru is way faster lately.
i'm at whatever stage of Bronydom it is that you like it, you watch and read fan stuff, but you don't talk to your friends about it.
"But I want it NAOO!"
but if someone else wants to take the mantle that's also fine
Hey everyone ^_^
Soon you wont care and carry around RD cutie mark on your backpack like me.
I don't push it on my friends
but if they mention ponies
Hiya Firefly.
It's better than ponibooru.net
the floodgates open
Stage 3: Closet Brony RAWRity
FLO RIDA is still in the club? Isn't he 40?
hiya firefly
21 characters.
yay wouldn't seem right imo, on the playstation my text said yay last year before the whole bronyism thing came up. I only put that cause at that time I had nothing else to say
DSN: Same
You have any ideas Firefly for my gamertag motto?
I'd like to be a tree.
How many stages are there, exactly?
Stage 4, is like acceptance and letting your friends know
The 21 characters is why its hard.
So would I
like I straight up don't care about strangers seeing it, but my friends are rather...closeminded when it comes to consuming media. The actually think Transformers 2 was GOOD.
Stage 5 is mega crazy brony
I try to be non-chalant about my bronyism. I don't want to overhype the show.
Hmm.
"Oatmeal, y u serious" is 20. Like really.
I'm overly obsessed with the idea of Fluttershy now....
rawrity: disregard uncultured buffoons, acquire new friends
My sister came over, and I'm not sure she noticed, even though chrome theme + desktop BG + phone + wearing Rainbow Dash Pin
I want a plushie.
You wear nothing but brony merchandise and quote the show every single moment you can
I think I'm somewhere between 4 and 5
:(
/me would feel more comfortable if someone else said something >.<
Can't believe how expensive the plushies are.
0Bye Everypony. Sleepy time
How much?
The show is awesome, the fandom makes in incredible
"I'm a brony, deal with it!"
0YES
0YES YES YES
lol
I want allllllll the high quality custom Fluttershys. All of them.
Night Razyn
your friends thought Transformers 2 was good? unfriend imo
Night Razyn
0NINE INCH NAILS FTW
they're nice people and all, but they're still in that stage where they think liking "little kid" stuff is stupid.
like 150$ last I checked
G'night Razyn
The one that was on EQD was 65
I just want one.
O.O
Night Razyn.
On My PSN its bronies are EVERYWHERE.
>middle school
Too much.
So
Hey
Still on stage 3, Open to you guys, but not to anyone outside the net, if they know my older brother will kick my rear end
Night, Razyn.
How long you guys been around?
I decided I shouldn't give a damn, but I won't flaunt it
"But I want it NAOO!" is good if you like Applebloom.
roushguy: I would love to give Fluttershy a hug :)
The cheapest one I've seen thus far is 65 haha
/me bursts into a ludicrous amount of tears.
6,0Where is the streaming tutorial?
I don't flaunt it but I gladly discuss it
I want a plushie Luna
on the forum
and Twilight
I'll link it
it's hard to tell people what I love about the show though
lol apple family is the shit
like this song
I got over it. Of course, one of my best friends absolutely hates Ponies.
>the plot
Hasbro Y U NO MAKE OFFICIAL PLUSSHIES?
"it's got great acting! great animation! good writing!"
Its like PPG All over with me again
I want show accurate Twilight anything.
Cause they are too lazy
iknorite
I'm stage... 3?
"no, seriously, why do you watch it?"
I was thinking "Something with Luna, my favorite" then I'm like "...Luna has about 3 lines in the entire show"
Though they do know that I've watched the show. I did a review of "Cupcakes" and mentioned that I'd decided to watch a few episodes to see what the hype was about
"..." *facehoof*
6,0As I said, I should have everything to stream music or desktop kind of things. . . but like Luna there will be
Hasbro, why you no make show accurate ponies!
I am making my own plusshies at the moment XD
pft, wait till s2
I'm more interested in the fandom than the actual show.
6,0Nothing from my lips
srsly
which is true enough, i just didn't mention that I'd then proceeded to watch the rest of the episodes.
not long
I put down MLP about two weeks ago :(
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:07h:00m:45s
I've only been here a day myself
and love them all.
Hasbro is not cashing in on us fast enough.
My facebook was the first thing to alert people to my..addiction.
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
asdfghjkl
we've been open for testing for about 2 now
Now I'm a mega fan
:P
0quick question. was it explained full on that celestia had pink hair in her younger days?
I can't wait till the day I see a Pony plushie in one of the Claw Machines. Actually, maybe not, because I'd probably fork out $25 trying to get that thing. >_>
lol
or has it only been a day
thats a lot of muffins XD
Dammit we missed 777777
wait... we missed the 7 7 7 7
Ahh
I started dropping pony phrases on fb
most people didn't catch on
fail
I was pretty tempted to flaunt it when the school year started, but I kinda... Well, didn't
I'd just smash the glass, take my Fluttershy, and leave.
Haha
>mfw I can't find the tutorials anymore
!mail DerpyBot 1.21 Gigamuffins
ForeverOdin:I would be going to jail for that plushies
For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
yes
not going to use a pony as an avatar though, I can't stand people who put fictional chars as their facebook profile pics
Thank you!!
/me glomps Ali1017
omg
o wait. The new episode screenshot every day... I guess I won't fast from ponies afterall.
Haha
13I still want the idea of everyone doing a podcast together. But its hard to get even most of everyone together at any given point.
I drop in pony wherever I can, most people dont care.
Well welcome to the IRC business
yeah
you gave Derpy too many :c?
T.T
I don't really need sleep, but I don't wanna sleep. I'll be playing fallout 3 if anypony needs me.
news?j
I'm putting it as my YouTube avatar

TO EQD
New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Set This Pony Down, I Smell Soft News! (http://tinyurl.com/3rnp3o2)
Me neither DSN, that always bugged me.
y thank u
13But could try and work something out.
My current profile picture is a garden gnome with the caption "How about I slap your shit?"
I don't post pony quotes on fb because I don't post posts period, but I did have a few different cutie marks as my picture (Octavia's, then Twilights, and I have a couple MLP references in my profile info, and I have quite a few different pony pages liked.
>streaming tutorials
We have the other PonyIRC
>in the STREAMER section
If you start streaming, I'll give access to it. XD
>can't see any such section
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
tovler YOU'LL NEVER ESCAPE THEIR GRASP
13I also know though not everyone is comfortable talking into a mic, which makes me sad.
which one? I was told that there were two others including us
I want season two to be NOW!
lol, well that's kinda circular :P
Peter S. Beagle is a BRONY?!
imean
excluding
YES!
>you can stream if you read the tutorial
that news article confuses me
lol my text is all red XD
>you can't see the tutorial unless you start streaming
Only one other
Just us and you
Oh my, some one did a pony version Of Nichijou?
how do you do bold?
like this
http://i.imgur.com/AVFSO.jpg
bb
hit the R button
ctrl+b
but again, I have the software set up, I'd just need to test it out at some point :P
Turn off bold
What.
buahahahahah
My current avatar is from Hourou Musuko.
Seth typoed your info on EqD
Well
then there are settings
You go bold by purchasing it at the stor.
I don't think Hasbro could cancel the show now even if they wanted to
*About to have seziure*
I don't even USE my Facebook anymore, haha.
I never use FB anymore. I don't care about these people I never see.
dont do bold
haha yeah
why would they want to
for me its command d
what store?
And the two avatars before that were both from Hourou Musuko.
I want to see some sales figures on the toy line
Well
I emailed him about it and he said he'd re do it next time
heck it took me a 2 months to start using my actual online handle here. I'm not quite ready to embrace them.
i mean command b
Bold off now FireFly
Okay
wiener
Everyone on the internet would go apeshit on Hasbro if they did it
fine
no fun
Well, I wish you well
oh dear.
If they did
WE would make it
Dumdeedumdeedummm
did what?
it's so hard getting used to not being able to see everything on a zetaboards I frequent :P
cool.
They would have to reinstate the show again as soon as they cancel it
OK listen up
I actually decided to change my online handle about two days before I first found out about ponies
so this is what it feels like to be mortal
Pretty much
When we say don't use bold
then I got hooked
I feel like I could watch a blank wall for hours
If they canceled the show, the world would end and an interdimensional rift would open, and something like TCB would happen.
That means, "don't use bold".
and DSNesmith has become pony-focused
Getting replaced by Ashton Kutcher, WINNING.
you too
I just 041744 for everything, but you can't start your name with number here
WINNING!
It does not mean "Everyone use bold now!"
I hate FB
The Charlie Sheen way
I have that much going on in my head right now
Hmm
Thank you.
Okay
I have an idea
applequest!
Okay
O_O
/me knew that was going to happen.
Okie Dokie Lokie
Okay
Who said "Don't use bold" ? I was looking at my keyboard
In the best intrest of IRC's
The animators seem to be worked to the bone. I hope they don't quit.
Wow
Ill pm you
totally.
alright
hope they get a break
Someones angry..
People think they are so technologically inclined just because they know how to open IE and use FaceBook
Darn it ponies, Is there nothing you dont go with ?
It's annoying
DannySwish: Ali1017 did, multiple times
bold gets annoyinh
Seriously? Stupid KVIrc
As did Octavia
I hope they don't kill themselves over it
And it's not just Sketchy_Sounds that is aggrivated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8V_rs6e7E
I feel sorry for people who use IE
Val... once we have an APPROVED reason to let you stream, we'll give you access to the streamer section.
I cant see it much on colloquy..
a041744 they dont go with G3.5
i just got in here so i didnt know
What is the meaning of 041744 for you?
Oh I see OCtavia said it once
Fluttershy: Yay :3
http://i.imgur.com/vrTPS.jpg
IE? this is 2011, mate
Oh yeah and Ali did too
It's bad enough that Lauren is done with the show. (she'll have a child by the time Season 3 goes into production)
We just don't want new mods streaming unapproved stuff at some random time.
Agreen, IE is the most unsecured browser
oh you have colloquy too?
Geez.
WO
I love that video Fluttershy
Whoo
BEST PONY TIME
Ever since I discovered ponies...
For ipod.
^^
I've been acting weird.
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff this song
Bloody IRC changed my name to Lordlyhour|2
Twilight RAGE!!!!!
/me highhooves DSNesmith
041744 was my school id for 12 years, so it just stuck, I like the flow of the number
>suddenly this song became tolerable and even good
It's basically just extremely annoying when the room's collective IQ takes a huge dip every so often.
6This song sucks... this PMV is good though.
Because everyone knows Twilight Sparkle>Twilight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqdaKZW48KU :P
Weird in what way(s)?
Ah. Its lost my connection
Rarity has done the impossible, she made this song sorta tolerable.
Hopefully we're cool with posting videos now :/
.... Question am I the only one that has the my little pony app for the ipod here?
I'm with sprinkles.
I mean, I've gone from being overly cautious about nobody finding out...
6Requests go in #Vinyl_Scratch
before ponies: wtf is this shit
6Not here
To bawling my eyes out
I got pony sounds.
Sorry no
App? What App?
after ponies: singing this song loudly at 2 in the morning
And now I'm obsessed with Fluttershy.
FluffyWuffs: but... Twilight is an awesome owl...
were still doing request, cool
I hate that song
wat
LOL @ Twilight Poneez
We still doing request?!
Anyway. I'm sleep-deprived and beginning to get massively snarky, so I'll spare you all my nastiness and go get the sleep I need.
13Wait a minute...
6If we are. *shrug*
It has everything I hate about modern society in it
I see. Mine was 020601416, which is not very good username material. That being said, one of my party members in a MMO I played had the name of 85456, which I took for myself.
Spin there is an app called my little pony pro
6Either way, no vid links in this room.
13I didnt even notice until you mentioned it, but yeah, its missing now for me too...
Have a good night Sketchy. Sleep well
Good night
Oh, bye!
I thought Luna just put her computer on a continuous playlist
G'night Sketch
/me facehoofs atomic7732
Guardians of Ga'Hoole

Fluttershy is awesome. Of course your obsessed.
IT HAS EVERYTHING!
Futashy stop that, Im trying to draw.
reorganization :P
^That
Luna's AFK or something.
DO WANT
It's because only streamers have access to the new section.
Merci
I don't own an ipod
2,14 yeah, no more requests for tonight
I'm addicted to Depeche Mode atm.
0__0
Good night! Drink Milk!
13I didnt even get the read the guide...
lol
fluttershy is ok but i rather have applejack or rainbow dash
Really?
OR?
its 2am here. I'm just not feeling tired at all... Then again, it's also Friday
lol doesn't matter because you don't need to stream anything?
I'd rather have them ALL!
/me 13sighs
0So, I missed the movies and episodes tonight I guess? I turned on the site at like, 11:40...was I too late?
I like all the mane 6, but fluttershy is my second favorite.
lol, rather, yes
And I never get tired of her.
13I was thinking about it...
So, is Friday Movie Night the only schedule for this chat? Any other special events that occur during the week?
11pm here!
I am off to sleep gentlecolts, see you all tomorrow.
yup
13I have the hardware
hey has anyone played the new Space Marine game?
0sh
bye!
hey Fireant
ok Im back
well, that's why we just petition for a spot
0ah*
night
4:05 here
I want a Derpy Plush. ^-^
Not for me....
For me
See ya, Allis
in the afternoon
Makes me sad that I can find desktop-monitor-keyboard packages at WALMART of all places that have triple the stats of my computer, for half what it was bought for T^T
that was a good breakfast
Fluttershy is perfect.
Night Alliszero
Hi fireant
13I;ve been here a while and I'
if it's approved, we get access. Seems fair to me
Hiya Rynros.
I usually find numbers for usernames a bit hard to remember, but I guess im just being a bit hypocrtical over here.
Rarity is the best pony!
Don't forget to thank Sumica again for streaming Season 2 beginning next Saturday.
Night Alliszero :3
Hello minions!
I am getting a derpy plush
Pacific coast FTW.
I try to be calm, but I often lose my temper...
6I literally just said that if we approve your for streaming whatever... i.e. an idea, as a backup, etc., I'll give access.
woo, sumica
FluffyWuffs, you misspelled Twilight.
I remember buying my first computer build
13*I've talked about it before, I shouldnt have to partition for it.
MrMooMoo: totally
minions? No I am your slave
Which Space Marine game? Halo, Star Craft, seriously which one?
Spose: Blasphemy
x.x
Space marine
as in
well, that was unpleasant
Do we have to like... talk about the best pony like 5 times a day?
40k
AMD Athlon 64 3700+ w/ 1 GB RAM and GeForce 6200
Ponies are the best Pony.
real space marines
6When did you say you wanted to stream?
Yes
6Oo
Powerful beast
13Several times.
And I really should just come out and admit that I've completely fallen in love with her.
2,14 oh yes
sigh
13And I had access to it before.
Current order (it changes ALOT) 1.Pinkie Pie 2. Rainbow Dash 3.Fluttershy 4.Twilight 5.Rarity 6.Applejack
we do have to talk about the best pony AT LEAST 5 times a day
2,14 giant robots....me gusta
BLU PONY
6Everypony had access to it before.
Wat
Oh I remember this from brony movie night 2
ON NO, HE HURT LUNA
I'm only talking about the mane 6.
I like, but wat
6Because it was disorganized.
!link big_macintosh
My two favorites are backround characters.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52991
What game is this?
6I moved it so new mods can't see it.
wow, I have a dam good memory
13But I'm in the middle of a move, I cant stream right now. So I was waiting until after my move.
i dont like pinkie pie all that much
Fluttershy is always my first. Second is random but right now it's RD.
I still have Dash and Fluttershy tying for first
okay then... out of all: Imbri and mane 6: Rainbow Dash
I love them all.
13>new mods
Current order: 1:Vinylscratch and Derpy
Every other pony?
OH YES THIS VIDEO
They can go awway and form a foreground for those 2
what is THIS?
But i love twi more...
THIS IS THE AWSOME
not new mods, non-streamers
6I literally give access to everypony on an individual basis.
Yes this VID...but with no AJ
Twilight!!
DSN; Amazing, that's what. :P
Eh, I kinda like Lyra, BerryPunch, and Octavia more than other BG ponies
suddenly communism
The complete history of russia to tetris
I agree completel Lordly
6-_-;
completely*
1 is Vinyl. 2 is Luna. 3 is Octavia. 4 is Twilight. 5 is Trixie. 6 is fluttershy.
Very nice. Thank you Derpy.
!plot
I love you, Sumica~
*wigglewiggle*
Rawr, exactly
russian history is depressing
Oh my.
Can't wait for Season 2 :D
And I love vinyl but i dont know her well..
For BG pony that's Octavia for me.
Big mac is an awesome character :D
Eh what did i do?
6Again, if you have a reason to use it, you'll get access to it.
Russia in general is depressing
serfdom, mongol invasion, crappy kingdom, crappier soviet union
Eeeeyup
Russia already ruled the world with a weapon called Tetris
less than 7 days till season 2 woooo
I find it hard to use background ponies as favorites due to lack of air time if its based off color schemes I'd say Scratch and Colgate
Ironically, I learned more from this one video than I did from an entire year of Socials class
6I just don't feel like changing forum masks for people.
Big Mac needs more screen time in s2
OH GOD MY BRAIN IS TRYING TO STAB MY STOMACHE, AND MY STOMACHE IS STABBING MY LOWER DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
and lines!
Theres nothing to really love about backround ponies unless you read fanfiction to give them depth.
/me would get Twilight every book in the universe just to snuggle her for an evening.
It's more than 7 days for me
13I thought as a mod I was able to look into streaming at any point.
Yes he does
6You are.
Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, Rarity.
*more about Russia, I mean
Course Vynl is just awesome.
FUCK, CAFFEINE WHY D YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT AFTER AN AMAZING HIGH
13And I'm not even a new mod.
6-_-;
13Oi.
I hope they have more Vinyl in S2
I just got lost in youtube land
to be fair, the reorganization is kinda needed, especially now that we have a distinction between mods and streamers
I just love Twilights and Vinyls mane.
13Well, I need a copy of DCD's guide still.
I like how refined yet pretty Octavia is.
Tetris always bored me.
Thats the entire REASON background ponies are awesoemn
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM
so is this all of russian history or just the revolution
roushguy: Switch Twilight and Applejack and you have my list ha
At the same time SuperBrony64 they also thought furbys were too.
Twilight Sparkle loves Tetris
I'm really angry at my brother and roommates right now... >.<
Wait, our real life CIA thought of that?! Wow our intelligence is not that smart.
I just wanted to see if you could be stirred from your lull, Sumica. What are you up to?
I like Luna because she dealt with crippling lonliness and hate for a thousand years.
Well
Well, in contrast, Furbys were a real threat
twilight/applejack are sorta tied.
:P
thusy, if we want them to be Ninja JEdi Cheerleader Timetravelling Bears in disguise, they CAN be
I just love purple..
furbies...
6It's less that and more of the fact that I don't want somepony coming by, doing stupid stuff that gets them fired, and having been able to see the stream info and now, with a grudge, being able to hijack it.
somehow I went from ponies, to sesame street, real life enactments of 8-bit games, to cup stacking
6Get it?
*shudder*
As are Pinkie Pie/Rainbow Dash
superbrony64 not all that unbelievable. There was a good 10 year period where the US legitimately thought EVERYTHING to do with Russia in even the most indirect ways was some kind of conspiracy
I'm gonna go soon
Ahh gotcha
fair enough
That trombone is good.
My old furby is still in my closet, waiting to kill me in my sleep.
Watching the strem, and trying to catch up with eqd.
... I just pictured Rainbow Dash with a pink mane and Fluttershy with a rainbow mane.
Thats sillly Scratch is a DJ.
staring at each other...
hahaha
y god
they come two weeks late
That would be so CUTE
The russians are planning their attack!
you like luna you say/
I actually baught some purple shoes just because my love of twilight..
Ponies are a threat to everything nonpony!
europe is red!
Ugh. I'm about to do my least favorite part in the game on Insanity with low ammo. Wish me luck guys!
13And you would really think some of us would do that Sprinks?
/me hugs #bronystate
oh look that guy got bricked.
Yeah, it'll encourage our soldiers to be much more friendly
RD in pink seems hilarious at the same time cute.
> mfw nuclear tetris block EVERY TIME
6Not some of you.
eh, it never hurts to play it safe
13Val...
John needs to draw RD in a maid outfit
Rainbowshy sounds awesome
I really wish I could afford to live by myself.
I wamt
/me hugs his toilet bowl
like right now...
ew dash in pink i cant see that its so ooc
6At this point I'm just too lazy to change your masks at the moment. XD
/me 13sighs
Dr. Strangelove reference?
this part reminds me of C&C
/me hugs Natelyn back
I wonder if they'll ever make a not brightly pink Celestia x)
13Not even going to go there.
Lordlyhour, I am!
She wore a pink wig in Swarm of the Century.
Me too, Sumica!
What is this video?
Maybe I'll look around an see if there are cheap studio apartments around
lol wth is this?
*Natleyn, I made the same typo AGAIN! D:
13But its fine.
I'm not saying that you're a liability or anything octavia
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXGM_Q1cCaQ
Cuz my roommates are bugging the crap out of me.
lol
:tetris history
I think rainbowdash "dressing in style" is cute..
It's okay. :3
its awesome
RainbowShy gets internets for taht
13Well, I've been here a while and I thought I was considered... not so far down the list, you could say.
Twiluna
it's the history of Russia set to the tetris theme
Better yet, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy with swapped colours, making out.
First paycheck when I get a job I'm buying this shirt http://www.redbubble.com/people/northerndash/t-shirts/7424363-awesomeness-etc?p=t-shirt&utm_campaign=us_tshirts&utm_medium=product_search&utm_source=google_products
13Same as how RBD was feeling.
Twixie.
But this song is awesome.
6>implying you are considered far down the list
This is why I am not a historian
i like that shirt XD
lol, twixie is awesome
I suck at History
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh10A8maTYw&feature=related
lol, McDonalds
6Like I said, I just haven't messed with the masks
but theres only one fic that does a good job with it
the true sign that communism has fallen
13Well, I'm feelings... I dunno. I dont want to cause drama, so I keep my mouth shut.
Still waiting for ballad of TwilightSparkle...
I have no one else to talk to about ponies, so when I even mention it around them, they get exasperated and annoyed.
13Okay.
6I'm pretty sure even Silver can't see it atm, since I haven't messed with it.
Best thing about Russia today: Putin.
That name makes me snicker
Future history...
gah, the ballad of twilight sparkle... I stopped reading it after chap 4
it didn't catch my interest
I need to be somewhere where I don't need to be around people who dislike what I like.
Best video ever XD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e87ESYB0hGA
!link flutterdash
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
well, that was depressing as all hell.
Its funny.
!link Raridash
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
depressing?
That was incredibly interesting.
Shame on you all.
it was just russian
6,0We will get it worked out. . .
*don't have
same thunderdash
it is... But it has a weird plot.
thunder_dash *
My Bronydom is a well kept secret but I have a shipment of Power level hiding t shirts coming in so hopefully I can weed out the bronies amidst my peers
looks more interesting than depressing
13But I wanted to look into streaming at some point, but in the middle of a move. So I havent had the time to really go through all the steps to really look into it yet.
R.I.P. Soviet Union. Some day you'll return again.
oh god
/me is now using the OC pony maker to make a Pink hair'd rainbowdash
gic!
Yay for YTP!

Tia and Tamara
Can't do it the other way around though
LOL
T.T
I just spilt my drink at germany
Are you Koffing?
IT'S GARY MOTHERFUCKING OAK
13I didnt even notice it was missing until it was mentioned I've been so busy.
Jazz Band, and Marching Band, and Concert Band, and AP Music Theory, and AP Chemistry. . .
oh, I thought that was going a much darker route with Germany
Shell look like cotton candy.

What would you guys do if the ponies were real?

Ponies are real. =P

OHH my bad

YTP is so random.
It's late, sorry ha
tag your it!
I'd find Fluttershy and smile so big I'd squeak
Wow, that star power sucked
Rainbow Road!
While my brother thinks my shirt is funny after a fashion, one of my friends said he won't be seen in public with me while I'm wearing it, and my brother and other roommates said they would if only to laugh when I get made fun of. Well, I've got news for them. I bet I'll get lots of brohoofs walkin' 'round with Sweetie Belle on my shirt.
this isn't the best YTP I've seen
lol my co-worker is like wtf are u watching. I just turn to him. then turned back to the screen
Season 2 will be crazier and YTPs exist
I would totally go to Twilight and say "Twilight, I wanna be a pony."
rofl suddenly bill ingvall
SUDDENLY ENGVALL
and she'd be all The MAGEECKZ!
synros, awesome
and then the entire world would become pony
6It's fine. Again, I just still need to mess with the masks. I've just been busy, and didn't think anypony would care about it too heavily for the moment.
Id love to twilight.
OHohOHohOH
lol
I want to give Derpy a real muffin. And rave with DJ P0N-3

I want to have pony dreams. I've yet to have one. =/
>yfw you first saw this and didn't realize it was moving
MY BODY IS ALSO READY
Rage sounds like something that would occur if she was insulted. Throwing sharp record disks.
I want to chill with Pinkie pie that would be a whole episode just hanging out with her
preparing
OH GOD
Not sure if body is ready....
Um, twilight, um, I... er....
Why is Twilight looking at me li- OH GOD! NO! *runs*
MY BODY IS SLOWLY PREPARING ITSELF
Why the freak is it that these ponies have such expressive faces?!
command+(+)

NO. NO. GOD NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I've had pony dreams
D';aww

:( now my friend got up and walked away
lucid dream
Goodnight fluffy Drink Milk!
Well hello, Twilight.
Dang she is getting closer, no Twilight I am a human and you are a pony! It will not work! Think of what the kids will look li- err ignore that last part. *runs*

Stay sexy
I... can't resist....
unsexy violin

I want to see more on the fights between rarity and applejack
What video is this lol
First time I saw this one I was expecting a screamer.
Darn it Twi, why u so cute?
I love lucid dreaming. Unfortunately, no pony dreams yet.
NO. THIS IS THE PONY THREAD SIMULATOR ALL OVE RAGAIN.
it's the eyebrows
Hey! Don't dis the violin!

Lucid dream

O GAWD SHES CLOSING IN!
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOCUTE.
No Synros It's all in your imagination.
I want twilight in a fight, that would be awesome.
Has been for some time Synros
I never lucid dream. Just dream a lot of pony that feels semi-automatic.
sultry
Wait I know how to excape! *ctrl+T* ha I am at a new tab! Freedom!
OH GOD IT FEELS LIKE MY STOMACH IS BEING STABBED, BUT THE STABBING MAKES IT IMPLODE
just watch, something will happen when she hits the screen, and scare the shit out of me
hey redditors http://rmlp.tk/
FACEROLL TO BARREL ROLL AND DODGE
I, uh... should change into something more comfortable
who here thinks they put rarity in the show to say "those snobbish, uptight, wenches are good people too!"
I do
*head explodes*
I watch an episode of pony right before bed to assure I have good dreams.
I want to see a Pinkie Pie one, where she hits the screen at the end.
lol
I hated Rarity for her snobbishness until Dog and Pony show happened.
I agree with trot_rot!
Dat sax
/me gets a change of clothing
I'm actively pusing my monitor away right now
ok, not creepy at all
Then I loved the hell out of her.
RAWRity: IS IT LEGAL TO KEEP A SMALL PONY IN YOUR HOUSE AS A PET LIKE A DOG?!
They put rarity in to match a stereotype
oh not again
phew...its over
can't do it
AHHH YAH
YAAAAAAAAAAY
and then break out of it
night everyone
lol
OH GOD...
dejavu

DON'T! STOP ME! NOOOOOW
07you loved it
07sorry I was taking a shower before going to bed
applejack is typical southern/western/rural girl

The only friends I have around me in RL are my brother, my roommates, and 1 other person. All of them hate the fact that I'm a brony. They don't treat me bad or anything, but they hate it when I bring up ponies. Which pretty much happens all the time for me now, whether I mean to or not.
SUCCESS! I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!

well
If only they did the whole video of this.
pears!
I HATE PEARS
All off my friends are pony fans like me!
Three
I HATE PEARS
I've been talking about them more and more
It's still awesome though.
I HATE PAETS
we watched this episode last week I believe
what...
aww
What
finally, free
NOOOOO
And I've grown hyper-obsessed with Fluttershy
I love Pez
I HATE PEARS
What?
Hmm..don't remember this line on Doctor who
wat
Darn it SME!
AND THIS IS PERFECT LULLABY MUSIC
DSN GO GO GO
6OH GAWD THIS
Awesome!
lol what are the girl versions of bronies called ?
fffffffffff
Pega-sis
hmm...this...actually...ME GUSTA
ters
ooh I love this one
Bronies.
This makes me rock out as much as anything
no
Bronies
See
Thing is
Bronies
I tried to show them the show, and they watched it. They honestly thought it was dumb, they didn't like the song.
*songs
Fluttershy is almost everything I am not
And they think the characters are stupid.
10 million fulltershys, we..are..fucked...
Darf14: It's part of Famil Of Blood/Human Nature, but it wasn't shown in the episode.
This actually makes "Fireflies" tolerable, mostly because this is the kind of stuff I expect diabetes causing sweetness about.
:O
She's calm, I'm usually trying to keep a lid on my temper
Ouch. Pretty much all my close friends know I'm a brony, and they'll tease me about it, but usually they're pretty tolerant. And I have onegood friend who was a brony without me converting him. Working on converting some of my other friends ha
Samehere mason sort of.
She's quiet, I'm usually kinda loud
I just love the soft voice on this song.
Oh didn't know that, thanks Aponymous
Yeah they have
Any ideas what the best MLP:FiM wallpaper is?
And they just can't get over the fact that it is ponies, always going on about how stupid it is for someone our age to like a show for little girls.
I like this, but the "I would just stand and... Smile" line irks me and I dunno why
She's shy, and I babble my head off when I meet new people... but that's because I'm shy in my own way
Same here ForeverOdin
10 million Fluttershys... wait I already made a hunting joke when this song last played
I actually like this, as in many more times than the original
I just dont know any bronies irl...
SuperBrony64
I like Fireflies... and this song.
http://wtfbot.net/pix/751.png
some guy on the comments for this vid complained about the autotune
Maybe that one guy from the AD IRC is right...
didn't we already take to Fluttershy about cloning herself?
Well, if one of my friends actually said that to me, I'd tell them that they're not understanding the simple fact that it is an escape. Like gaming and reading. An escape into innocence.
ah well
TrollightSparkle: I wouldn't expect any less >_<
:)
Anypony still want that Twilight video?
Yeah sockwear
what time is season 2 eastern standard time
I really don't like my life
Tonight, my brother and roommates all pretty much said that they wish I had a restore point top before I was a brony, cuz they'd rather listen to me constantly talk about TVTropes than ponies.
I want to go to some meetups.
2,14 9 AM anon
not soon enough
*to
That art looks good...but the horn...well....I will just leave it at that
So why can't I imagine a better life in Equestria?
6,0I wanted to sing this song...
6,0Fluttershy version though... not original.
I was just at a reddit meetup a few days ago
ANYWAY, for great justice
meetups are awesome
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
Is there any meaning to the Pillow on the head or am I just being stupid?
MrMooMoo, http://bronies.com
I'm throwing caution into the wind and am gonna wear an RD shirt to school on monday
Even for ponies, I'm not getting up at 9 for a saturday, so I'll be recording the episode.
screw the haters
^ the best plan
It isn't so much not liking life, its more an escape from the daily stress of every day life. Stress relief, if you will. It is cute, it is innocent, it has funny moments, etc.
6,0Testing the music stream would be wonderful, if we could have a try at it
9 AM PST?
2,14 Awwwwwww RAWRity....join us!
I'm getting up. >w>
Theres are brony group in my area too.
Whats the name of that song?
2,14 EST
9am EST
try geting up at 6 RAWRity =p
As in, that morning, that morning?
I really want there to be a meetup where I live, but I doubt there ever will be, at least anytime soon hah
this channel should have
Oh damn
I'm going to stay up to see the Season 1 marathon anyways, so... :P
That's 6 PST
My friends probably wouldn't like it because they fear losing their "man card"
ForeverOdin, you could start one
2,14 RIGHT ON Thunder_Dash!
Nor Cal Bronies!
We talking about tomorrow or when Season 2 premiers?
Omnom
sumica NO, i do that the rest of the week as it is (GOD DAMN 8 AM CLASSES)
2,14 we're gona party pinkie pie style
6,0Val, I have about 150GB or more of music so..... we would be rolling
Jam toll thingies
Season two
Yeah...bronies.com has no known Northern Nevada brony locations on their map.
roll**
17th SuperBrony64
Sockwear_Moon, that doesn't mean they won't like it, it just means they'll be conflicted about liking it
/me brohoofs ValtheJean
niiiiiiiiice
Sockwear_Moon, just like all of us were :P
Pinkie has hands
Ok
Odds of me finding enough of them for a meetup are slim to none...
/me brohooves everypony
I pretty much figured I'd use youtube and grooveshark for all the songs
I've actually thought about it, But I'm not too good with those types of things. Maybe sometime though.
but hey, that works too :P
*brohoof*
Ponies with hands just look wrong
OMG there is one in the bay area! i am so joining!
Is anyone streaming the 6pm repeat of MLP?
That Pinkie is a lie!
/me returns the brohoof
We are Tovler
Night, ponies.
Wait 6 AM or PM?
Its an alternate reality
what ar the lyrics for this?
Seriously
Good night Natleyn
Well, yeah. But it would be difficult to get them to watch it in the first place. I know I was on the fence with the pilot episode, but I warmed up to it by the end.
2,14 6 PM is the re-showing
2,14 9 AM is the premiere
6am pst on the 17th
You don't loose your mancard when you become a brony
neat
13Did we confirm there is a re-showing?
Damn, okay
you get an upgrade

2,14 well sumica just said he is :P
Yus
Octavia: I guess so
I will let you know tomarrow Octavia
So it will be 8 here for the reshowing
2,14 or not, never mind
2,14 I'll just go back to hiding under a rock :P
13The Hub schedule isnt up to the 17th yet, so I'm unsure.
2PM here for the reshow
I'm hoping you can get a Season Pass on iTunes for Season 2
I have a few shirts
Shave and a haircut 2 bit
again....
While I like that they're trying to bring back saturday morning cartoons, I also despise getting up before noon on saturdays...so it seems we're at an impasse Hasbro.
Well yeah. We all know MLP is the manliest thing on the planet. :P
hang on lemme find the page
I have 4 shrits.
dejavu, oh well this ad still rocks
shirts, even
sadly the guides are only for 1week in advanced
I wish my iPod was like this D:
I need shirts
:\
2,14 lol I don't sleep in on weekends anymore
13One schedule I looked at didnt show MLP on any other time during the day except the 9am premiere. But I'm wanting to see the Hubs itself

ahh crap
Appleloosan Psychiatrist?
didn't bookmark the site
2,14 there's too many pony related things to do ;)
6,0Grooveshark?
ha! you support apple
I have one shirt. My Dumb Fabric shirt.
Having a Derpy background and all the episodes ISN'T ENOUGH
Haha Old Spice time
I have no shirts, unfortunately. I should get one with Derpy's cutie mark, or Twilight's.
LOL mason!
Shut up and take my money!
it's become my source of music ever since Imeem got bought out by gay-wad myspace
Big mac pimpen
it's just a giant music database
and you make playlists from it
Big mac is awesome eeyup
AND THEN BIG MAC WON RARITY'S HEART
Correction take my bits!
I'm actually quite surprised though how few bronies there seem to be here, but how tolerant they are anyway. I'll wear my Vinyl Scratch shirt downtown and get no worse than an amused glance here and there. Otherwise, either people don't get it well enough or don't care.
ALL MY MONEY, TAKE IT
I am a horse
6,0I have professional DJ software, overkill kind of stuff, so burning down into the ground would be okay
lol
Aw

6,0Sounds nice to me
I have RD
I like that Violet :P
Fluttershy
Love this one
and derpy
Is someone controlling the videos now? lol
Oh this one :)
I don't have any MLP stuff

I'm too poor

OMG, what's happening?
FOR LUNA!
Is Luna awake again?
2,14 meh...I don't really like this vid
Oh no...no...dont they dare!!!
HELLO~

He's not bombing Ponyville?!
I don't like where this is going...

I'm going to order one tomorrow
AND THEN WE DESTROYED THE PLANE
>: (
LUNA U FOOL
Luna, should've known she would be behind it
and hopefully get it so I can wear it to school next week
Curse you Luna! TO THE MOOOONNNNNNAAAAA!
but what ones? i want ALL THE SHIRTS!
Celstia is not amused
:P
at first I was like "I'm not commercializing!"
I got mine for $10, and I love it. ^.^ Not all merc is super-plushie expensive
ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNONS ARE A GO
Its the orbital Friendship cannon
My city is really too small scale for me to have any chance of encountering a brony.
GOTCHA
Holy shit, this is actually well made
What video is this?!!?
but after seeing how many other bronies there are
Silly Luna, I have a Kill Sat!
There are so many bronies
overkill much?
lol the moon
you need to be flamboyant to find other ones
And THAT'S how Equestria was made!
AND THAT'S HOW APOLLO 18 STARTS
i luvvvvv ranbow dash
I just got them so it's like a homing beacon to fellow followers
lol
unmade
6,0like what?
I'm hoping by wearing the shirt that I'll find some bronies at my school, I already know of two
but some people don't like flamboyant bronies :/
DJ software
tis nice
What's the name of this video?
this is the viedo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x8bZJPovUQ&list=PL2A047F574F63F78E&index=49
i was marred to her last week actually.
I could try going to Reno, but I doubt anyone would just say, "OMG, you a brony, too? Let's exchange contact information and try to get other bronies together!"
Trot-rot: Same here actually
Great, now luna is the sole survivo- oh nevermind
but seriously, Apollo 18 sucked.
I need to start using tab lol...
Apollo 18 ahem,, had no atmosphere
in a small country town of 2700 people, i have doubts ill find other bronies
at least, in large crowds
Thanks a041744!

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
i loooooooooooooove her
6,0It works well. . .

"DID YOU KNOW SUCKING MY D__K IS A PUNISHABLE OFFENSE!"
Ponies, now make's you forget to eat just the same way as WOW
6,0okay... let me know what we find out
Good night rawrity!

Night, Rawrity
thunder-colts parents think he's watching angry porn

DON'T DO IT RAWRITY! SEASON 2 IS RIGHT AROND THE CORNER!
It doesn't bother me if you like Rainbow Dash. "MLP should be an anime" is what sounded like trolling.
LOL
Hey Billy
Night Rawrity
Night RAWRity
Hi Billy
>i can't change >never tries to
first time on this site what is it all about
superbrony64 not THAT type of signing off.
Is this a full episode or just the theme song?
welll
I have to sleep.
All my very best BLARG
its bcuz i love the japanese :))
I want to not even sleep till season 2 gets here
and everyone is asleep here too, so im like "oshiz"
I'd rather Japan NOT get there hands on MLP
2,14 this is about the best kind of Streaming Billy ;)
RAWRity: Oh, okay, night then :P
:/
*their
6,0and do not do what we can not do okay?
6,0whatever you do
Gah
Theme song
:(
THey can have a dub, sure
2,14 every friday and saturday we stream movies alongside pony episodes
inb4 I'll take an apple
But I don't want an 'anime' version
and idk it seems like itd be a sucess lol
6,0do that
AND EAT IT
2,14 and we will be streaming Season 2 live on the 17th
if that happened then we would have bad dubs and the show would go down the tubes so fast it makes my head spin
DEADLY SRS
Lets see it
Uhoh
I hope the japanese like it.
>mfw wut?
at what time since i am australian
Serious business goin on here.
I think that "Rainbowshy" should be the one with rainbow hair, though. That only makes sense.
The anticipation!
DON'T TELL ANYONE!
OH
/me now remebers PPGZ
SNAP
9AM PST
*gasp* Biggest spoiler of all time!! :o
2,14 not familiar with australian timezone, but it's 9AM EST
off topic, but i remember hearing there's going to be a season 3
/me listening
So they could make the toys for it.
WHAT?!?!!?!?!
they will find it Kawai (did I spell that right?) Im sure they will love it
WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH?!
*EST
Yes, there is likely a season 3
I luv rainbow dash, because shes so sassy nd powerful.
my bad ^^;
thunder-colt, that's never off topic.
and Snape kill Dumbledor
Did NOT see that coming!
Ah yeah, Madmax's comic.
Hi dari!
Hey.
Everyone's going to be so disappointed when it turns out to be a pony.
<RoyGBiv> A lot of people are holding weddings today because it's 9-10-11
^What?
...Oooh
Man, this sucks.
I was trying to figure out why the hell you would want your wedding to be on the day before 9/11
I'll have to wait at least two years to buy the car I want now. ANOTHER two years.
Why?
Yeah, but everyone wants a CUTE wedding date
So 9-10-11 & 10-11-12 are like booked up worldwide at wedding sites
Don't have the cash to buy it, and I need a second car right away
I'd rather get married on 12-12-12 if we're going for cute. :p
So buying a cheaper car, and then saving up for that one. But with my credit, having two car loans will be impossible, so I'll have to pay this one off before anything.
A wild RainBro appeared.
ohai
2,14 omg it's Rainbro!! <#
oh, ill register and you can op me dari
Rainbro?
2,13 <3* even
while you're here
Ohai Rainbro!
/me uses Splash
/me hugs Rainbro.
/me it's not very effective.
Hi RainBroDash
OATMEAL
ARE YOU CRAZ-
So right now we have Rainbow, Rainbow_Dash, and RainBroDash in chat. That might get a little confusion.
... confusing, even.
>mi cara cuando my brain is oatmeal from not getting enough sleep
>mi cara cuando I have no face
10kk dari I'm registered
10ty
Gonna get ready to go seal my fate for the next two years. Later gentlecolts
Ciao, mate.
Aand ponychan is post-locked yet again.
This is going to be a thing all day, I'm guessing.
GREAT SCOTT,my name is bold!
2,14 I feel really bad for !!Celestia
Likewise.
2,14 the spam raids have been going crazy, and mods are quitting like every week it seems
Yeah.
I'm hoping this last one wasn't because of any particular incident. From what little I've seen of her, I really liked !!Pinkie Pie.
2,14 !!Pinkie Pie did a lot of background cleaning up
2,14 he probably just got really tired, and didn't want to handle the stress of S2
Well, he did say that he'd like to come back and be a moderator again in the future and that this was just a vacation for him, so... probably.
From what I understand he (or she?) runs a lot of other things too.
2,14 yeah
2,14 well, best wishes to him
9oh yay
10:3
And then NewDCD was here.
Hi DCD!
Not sure which celestial bodyy to do random facts about today
Io.
Alright,I'll do Jupiter's 64 moons
hello?
10ohai
Jupiter has 64 confirmed moons,[1][2] giving it the largest retinue of moons with "reasonably secure" orbits of any planet in the Solar System.
wat
Ignore those numbers
10EmmettBrown you and your damn moons
so howmany days left?
except 64,64 is important
10john_pony it's one week today
10next saturday morning (usa time)
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
10I know right :D:D
gotta love rainbowdash quotes
I'm very excited.
10 20% cooler than all other pony quotes.
yerp
Cool,my apple makes a rattling noise when I shake it
... is... is that normal?
well everypony ima go ill see yall later
I haven't had an apple in months, can't remember if they're supposed to rattle.
10cya john_pony
Also, ciao john_pony.
echo and then RainBroDash / Olly was off in Skype.
lolwut
10wat?
... Olly?
10... is my name irl ;)
Looked it up on google,got millions of results about iphones but none about apples
Ah.
10EmmettBrown I'm really not sure if they are /supposed/ to rattle. We need to test this, for science
I'm afraid to eat it now
It might be a spy.
10there is only one other person in the entire world who has had this problem
10xD
10"why does my apple rattle -iphone -macbook -laptop -phone -ipod" is what I googled
10the rest are nonsense results
I remember watching a play where the entire story broke off half way through to talk about a species of apples that rattle when you shake them
Wow.
Now I'm curious: What was the play?
Maybe it has immigrants in it
10^
he paly was Danny;champion of the world
10anyway peoples, gonna go play some starcraft 2 in the sun
Ciao RainBroDash.
2,14 you'd better play zerg
Tell the sun I said hi.
10see you all in a bit :3
2,14 or I wont wub woo anymore
The sun?
What's that?
I haven't seen that in 4 days here.
A rattling apple. How interesting
Just clouds.
10and ValtheJean ofc I play zerg.
10I play zerg at a horribly casually bad level
10anyway be back later and ting
10gonna go see what all the fuss is about
2,14 good, good :P
2,14 zerg are the ponies of starcraft :P
10just on vacation with the family
10SC2 with the Sonic Adventure 2 soundtrack on in the background
10inb4 everybody is jelly
/me 10is now actually going afk for real
SA2 Soundtrack?
/me would rather listen to More Gun. Over and over and over...
Anyhow, gonna shower. BBL.
There were so many rock ballads in the sonic adventure 2 soundtrack
The most massive of Jupiter's moons, the four Galilean moons, were discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun.
It's very quiet
Why is my name bold?
2,14 so you can see whenever someone addresses you
Now the zombies shall be afraid of me, for I have a stick with nails in it!
Lol, but seriously. A stick with some nails on the end is my best weapon for now
20 minute shower. That was fast.
Ponies
I think My Little Pony is a pretty cool guy.
Eh learns about friendship and doesn't afraid of anything.
/me waves to all
/me waves back
/me waves to the both of you.
/me gives MeteorVenture a party hat
/me raves back
/me gives a party hat to DragonRage
Danke.
You still havent given me a party hat. D=
/me gives Rainbow_Dash a party hat
Anyhow, gonna play some more TF2 while waiting for the stream. Still got an hour to go.
Thanks. =P
Also, hey MeteorVenture
almost max level in the Space Marine multiplayer already
hey!
i've been kinda bummed out today.. it's getting better though
*Stretch* HOW IS EVERYONE?
(see last post)
/me gives Alumonius a party hat.
if you want to know why i am bummed out then i will give you a beautifully written explanation
Your written explanations usually fry my brain. So no thanks XD
i'll take that as a yes since you said (with added punctuation for better understanding) "written explanations? my thanks"
so here's what happened.. >see a R34 picture >close it >it never leaves
it's been bugging me all day long.. and it happened yesterday
so i'll probably be at least less bummed out by tomorrow
Start>Shut down> wait> turn back on
well when i said never leaves i mean it's burnt into my brain for the time being.. since i don't want it there it naturally stays for a long long time.. like a song
a terrible song that you would like to punch if it had physical form
tehe
Welp, that could've gone better.
what could have? i ask
Another round of Turbine, this time I played Engie.
Chose to go on RED despite them having lost three rounds and only won one.
We pretty much stalemated the last thirteen minutes, so RED lost on account of having won less round overall.
Still, met yet another brony because of it.
I seem to have a lot of luck with that.
speaking of which.. i went back on kongregate after a long absence and found a friend or 2 were now bronies.. 1 had pinkie pie as his avatar
Awesome.

I would like Memebase's brony site a lot more if they didn't blatantly watermark everything
ohay everypony
what's up with the inferior streaming service you guys use btw
6Veemi?
should consider switching to justin.tv
6...ew god no.
why not
6Because ew god no?
i come from a community where everyone and their mom streams at 1080p so watching these 360p streams feels so ghetto
:P
Veemi works fine...
Nine minutes! LETS LIVE THROUGH IT!
/me hugs Alumonius
http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/demotivational-posters-vicious-cycle.jpg
in any case i hope you guys upgrade the stream quality at some point
http://chzragecomics.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/rage-comics-that-guy-zelda-or-whatever.jpg
6,0We are working on it Mantis, by the livestream of Season 2 we will have clear picture.
cool
they offer high and low quality (respective to each other) and with a chat of 200 bronies it still slogs down
well in the esports scene we'll have 50,000 people watching and stream chat literally unreadably fast
at 1080p
so those are honestly problems of 5 years ago
and not 2011
zelda = 100X better than black ops (i've only played for 0 minutes)
2,14 as an fyi, chat is completely irrelevant to the stream being slow
HATE DETECTED FIRING ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON
2,14 that was just on the streamer's side
9ohai guys what's going on in this thread?
2,14 suddenly, DCD
just chattin'
Waiting
6,0Happy Birthday DCD! :3
http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wtf-photos-videos-invisibilly.jpg
9>reads chat
9oh lawdeh
9Mantis
It's DCD's birthday?
9what's your monitor's resolution?
what does that have to do with anything
9a lot.
9just tell me.
It's your Birthday DCD?! Party!:D
no need to get defensive :)
does anybody know if bronystate will be doing this for every episode, or only the premiere?
2,14 every episode my friend
cool
2,14 if it's Season 2, we're streaming it ;)
:]
my college doesn't have the hub channel
9so Mantis, what do you define as 1080p?
convenient
NewDCD i don't pretend to have some godly knowledge of these things, all i know is your stream quality is what i was watching 5 years ago
what it says on the tin when iwatch streams is 1080p
and it looks the same as 1080 on say, youtube
/me is very lucky to have the Hub and not know it before season 1 ended
so that's all I can tell you
9well you've been fed nothing but lies. 1080p is a resolution.
9ergo, a 700 x 520 window will NEVER be true 1080p
9it might try to emulate it
9but it will NEVER be 1080p
ok
9not to mention we're not a commercial business
doesn't change the difference in quality though
9businesses can do that
It might be 1080p if you maximize it...
9we can't
uh
people stream from their basements
NEWDCD!!!!!
/me gives NewDCD a party hat
9okay buster

HD ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON!
wait, wat?
there's one that "says 1080p" which i guess is wrong but
look
NewDCD's birthday is today?
I CAN READ THE WORDS ON THE SCREEN HOLY SHIT
which is more than can be said about your stream
and these are facts that your overly defensive attitude isn't changing
also this guy streams from his house
and is not a business.
/me waves at NewDCD, trying to get attention
and i could link you dozens of people who do the same, at different times of the day
I HAVE RETURNED

NEWDCD
oh no, he's back
4I actually am partially religious

11Allo.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAN
Yes.
ohai Silverscreen
GODDAMNIT VIOLET GET OFF!
My mind is really never blown.
/me gives Silverscreen and NewDCD a party hat each.
bow chicka wow wow
/me 11is doing work for BronyState. Is only half here.
Hi Silverscreen!
/me gives RandomExtra a party hat.
A point-blank shotgun blast to my head couldn't blow my mind.
9okay guys
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
11A PARTY!!!
6,0Half part for Silverscreen~
9get in there, I'll show you "720p"
9and then I'll explain why we aren't doing it
no it would just blow your brains apart Nittany_Tiger
I'm 30, bi, overachiever, hopefully not racist, pantheist, so....
2,14 lol DCD, did you set that up JUST to show him?
11THE BEEPING!
Can we start the broadcast please? I'm tired of waiting for something to happen :l
11IT'S GONNA BLOW!
Mind NOT blown.
NEWDCD
/me 11HITS THE DECK!
No, it would blow the rest of my head away but leave my brain.
6It's starting in a second, Alu.
k
9Alumonius,we're having technical difficulties with the main channel
/me crawls away
jease and I thought I did too much tab browsing.
Gotta tell you something, NewDCD.
9please direct your viewing to the 720p demo in the meantime
WE SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY MAN, ISN'T THAT AWESOME?
9HAPPY BIRTHDAY DRILLGUY
2,14 Oh oh! DCD! Show us some robots!
9okay starting 720p test
So many tabs...
May 7th: best day ever.
/me brohoofs NewDCD
6,0First of may? First of may! Apple bucking starts today~
11...
LOL
Not getting any sound
hey that ep was on thismorning.
May is the climatological peak of tornado season.
11am I the only one who hears nothing but beeping from that stream?
Beeping here
we all hear it silverscreen
I hear it too.
/me gives Sumica a party hat.
DCD's alarm is going off.
No beeping, just... no sound
Or a bomb.
/me 11mutes it and goes back to work.
The beeping is getting faster.
And that beeping is speeding up.
it's the tab-overload alarm
damn it. Well killed the audio
maybe really low beeping?
Oh a hat, how quaint.
/me explodes
however, how do you like the video
Party hat for NewDCD and my birthday's today!
I wish I could brush Rarity's hair for her... oh wait, I can.
It appears ... really jerky for me
Laggy as hell
*brushie brushie*
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-percent-harder-in-ten-seconds-flat.jpg
and that's why we don't do 720p. Most internet connections can't handle it.
DecapKing, were you ever known as El Decapo anywhere?
nope
OK GOOD
Decapman, xxheadremoverxx
i can't even load the stream
9see what I mean?
My connection can handle 720p fine, but the stream's still jerky
I have 100meg internet and it's just choppy
Eeyup
and some other things
9no matter how good your internet is
9most computers cannot handle the high internet load plus the whole rendering
Oh I totally get it
9it's just too much of a load divided by little time
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-me-too-pega-sister2.jpg
9think of it as a decimal dividing a whole number
Well, to be fair to MantisToboggan, the stream he linked to works perfectly fine in 720p for me.
1/(.5) = 1/(1/2) = 1*2 = 2.
I can do what the internet can't!
9by the way, Dermathil
but I agree that that's not a very wise setting, or you wouldn't get half the viewers
9Pinkie, link his ass
4O.O
4I read that differently...
Huh?
wat
?
9also Dermathil
13lmao
9do you post in ponychan
I am sure with corporate sponsors we could totally have that kind of stream too.
I once did, but the total number of posts probably don't even reach the double digits.
only once
Is the stream up?
I have good internet connection, but not that good pc, so I much rather take slightly smaller stream anyday if that means no lag
I post5 on Ponichan ALL THE TIIIIIME
I hate chans.
I avoid them.
4chan just gives any chan a bad name.
*waiting for broadcast*
6,0I read something bad in that DCD c.c
Yeah. It also puts a much higher load on the streamers' computers, cutting down the number of viable streamers for BMN.
I guess chan is just taboo on the internet
I GOT AWAY!YAY!
9just link me, Robot
what about ponichan nittany?
I post on Equestria Daily now that that FUCKING BASTARD Dave Mustang the Cynical Brony is gone
Nope.
Dave Mustang was not a true Brony
To what he already linked you to, NewDCD?
Hell, he hates Bronies and ponies now
I know that ponychan has restrictions, but it seems to harbor problems in itself.
whats this about Dave Flutteryay?
wat, SC2?
I'd rather watch ponies than SC2, though :P
His youtube channel is http://www.youtube.com/user/clonecomanderfox
Dave Mustang?
Not a misspelling
Was the broadcast supposed to begin 30min ago? Because Im getting offline
9hmm
Yeah he... ugh... he's a traitor
Never heard of him...
2,14 please be patient everyone, we're working on a solution
9Twitch.tv
/me doesn't know who he is :(
9never had heard of them
He was an asshole to everypony anyway
Dave Mustaine probably never like ponies to begin with.
No, not Mustaine. MUSTANG
Also, he's the lead singer of Megadeth.
9I'll look into it
Dave Mustang?
I love Megadeth
Solution to what?
Seems like a pretty good streaming site, since you can choose your preferred resolution.
2,14 DCD, could you join us in Modchat?
Wait that Dave Mustang who pops up when I google "Dave Mustang"?
No clue who Dave Mustang is...
seems like Twitch.tv is for gaming only
same here, never heard of the name
Same.
9yeah
9exactly
Twitch is a spinoff of Justin
I don't even know who that Dave Mustang in google is, apparently some musician...
9Twitch.tv must have
9some propietary software
no his full name is "Dave Mustang the Cynical Brony"
9not to mention their streaming software (justin.tv) is EXPENSIVE AS FUCK
But I am intrigued what has this Dave Mustang done?
2,14 well then, if mantis wants to see us upgrade, he's more than happy to pay us for it :P
9as in
Look at posts on Equestria Daily from July
9 999 dollars a month
You will see him
look @ the comments
9for those packages
Ohwow, that's really expensive shit.
I'm late I'm late I'm late
Hi guys! one more week!
Wait, why isn't the stream on?
Ok I will look at ED in July and look for him, brb
I googled his name, all of them are reactions to his posts, so it looks like he's acquired a lot of hate
EEEEYUP
Like I said we could totally stream like that with corporate funding =p
Oh it's the guy who wrote that article about intolerance amongst Bronies?
VioletVanilla is gone!HURRAH!
and I quote: "Dave Mustang, the cynical Brony said... Best Blogger Tips [Reply To This Comment] When will somebody write the story about Scootaloo kidnapping Dash, raping her, and then skinning her alive?"
THE FUCK?
damn, thats fucked up
so yes...he sounds like a dick
yup
Wait, he said that
Hmm.
so there's no eurostream today?
DAVE MUST DIE
No wait he's that commenter.
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
9get your asses in here
2,14 please everyone be patient, we are working on getting the stream back up
lol Dave Mustang complains about the quality of brony writing, then says that bronies will be the "laughing stalk" of the internet. Oh, the precious irony.
heres another
There's dedication, then there's just fucking obsession, and that first video is obsession. You know what, we're all destined to become like the final remaining Bronies on /b/, where their average post looks like something an eight year old girl has written. It's inevitable, us Bronies are going to go from being silly,
to being the laughing stalk of the internet. We're all losing touch with our roots. Didn't the fandom start because of a raid on /b/ by /co/? I say we go back to those original root!
6Guys, please file into the stream link DCD just posted.
>mfw the fking ad is trying to kill my browser
NOPE RETICENT
Different stream?
that's not my words Pegacorn...
2,14 http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
That's Dave Mustang
NewDCD eh? i thought xsplit was like 50 bucks lifetime
Dave Still sucks.
it was free up until recently though so can't remember
Oh silly me, I didn't notice the link
I thought you new me better Pegacorn >.>
NewDCD, is there a different chat for that other stream?
2,14 no, stay here for chatting
6Just use the popout, Derm.
I dunno RS?
So he's a jackass I didn't know about before, and will now go back to not knowing about.
6At the bottom of the bronystate.net page.
Time for some ponies!
YAY
Haha! Time for one of my favorite movies!
...or True Romance, first, I guess
6Alright, time for True Romance.
One of mine, too, Aponymous!
I guess I got lucky that I never read Dave's comments, even though I go to Equestria Daily constantly
*Brohoofs RobotPinkie*
/me brohoofs Aponymous for the kickass A-movie choice
yup
Yay!
he hates us "ponyfags" now
This movie has quite strong cast
/me gives party hats to all those who didn't get one already
I've learned that reading comments sections on ANY site is a waste of time.
BTW NEWDCD, the A movie next week is FKING BLADE RUNNER!!! FK YEAH
YT comments typically ruin the quality of the posted video.
BLADE RUNNER
*there
Especially when they're unoriginal.
ohai luna
LUNA!
LUNA
Pretty much... comments tend to be completely useless.
/me hugs Luna
This is how you pick up chicks in a bar.
Elvis is not dead
07ohai everypony
Hi Luna. How's the moon?
/me meows at Luna
HARRISON FORD
HAHAHAHAHAA
ohai Luna
Hello Luna
also NewDCD if your point of not having current-day stream quality is that people won't have good enough connections to handle it, fair enough i guess. it's never been a problem (again) in the scene i come from, since justintv, own3dtv, regame etc provide the ability to switch stream quality
Oh hi Luna
And then i doomed everypony.
/me gets out a potion and throws it at Luna
07beautiful and full
hey Luna
/me hugs Luna
/me gives Luna a party hat
"I'd fuck Elvis, wanna see some kung fu flicks?"
I was just about to say that Luna needs hat
hey, hey luna, did you know I shared my birthday with NewDCD's?
07yep
07that's why I said happy birthday Derma & DCD :P
HEY LUNA,THERE'S A POTION FLYING TOWARDS YOU!
/me is feeling all giddy inside, probably because of the birthday fact
Happy birthday Dermathil and NewDCD!
no one knows when my birthday is XD
Right happy birthday guys
!
No one does either for me but I am not telling
/me grabs it
07thanks
btw NewDCD, bjornfot won the B movie slot for next week. Guess what he chose?
9oh God.
http://chzbromania.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/guidos-bros-douchebags-fratboys-rage-on-reality-bro.gif
The MLP G1 movie
Sea Ponies: The Musical.
the original
Everytime someone mentions that movie a puppy dies
the GIF i just posted
SHOOBEDOO SHOOP SHOOBEDOO movie
OHGOD!WHY?
Bjornfot could very well become the next Tacowiz.
I don't like seaponies
oh, the resident technoviking though is good for it.
Nah, Sea Ponies isn't in MLP: The Movie
HEY LUNA!I DARE YOU TO DRINK THE POTION!
also wtf, as i scroll up
justintv is free
well he chose the MLP the movie
not 999 dollars a month
9Mantis, Mantis, Mantis
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
9you don't know shit about streaming, do you?
so Flutteryay, I've seen some ridiculously blatant comments by Dave to troll the community, but he does post seriously once in awhile
not really
Call on the sea ponies~
i know that a ton of people i know stream
Yep, Dermathil, lol
9allow me to show you, then.
out of their apartment on their computers
without making excuses for having poor quality
sorry guys, the stream is offline?
ReticentSmolder, yeah, but now he posts on youtube as clonecomanderfox, trolling and hating on bronies
Turgle: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9896347.jpg
She is a true blonde
9* Starter $99 /month
also, @Flutteryay that sucks... seriously he's made some really hateful comments
9Standard $499 /month*
eeeyup
huh, since when
I managed to stream on my ipod with the free justin.tv app
and Enterprise: 999 per month
that's uStream
thanks RobotPinkie for the link
Justin.tv charges for their streaming software, dynno and Wirecast
Storm chasers stream with Justin.tv.
that said
I chased with a couple of streamers this year.
Well it's NewDCD streaming, I'm pretty sure, thank him :P
there is a vital reason we're not using justin.tv or uStream as our main streams
their output size is perpetually 320 x 240
It might look good little, but when you maximize it...llooks like crap
hate justin.tv, its way too laggy for me for some reason
05Prepare yourselves, the bells have tolled! Shelter your weak, your young and your old! Each of you shall pay the final sum! Cry for mercy; the reckoning has come!
Oh, you have to pay to get above 240p?
05in other words, Hi everypony
also keep in mind Sathi and Sprinks are still learning my quality optimization techniques
ohay Wrek
http://www.justin.tv/p/pro_faq
pretty much
i really don't know where you get these numbers from
New mod?
hey Wrek
/me 13is reminded of the Halloween event on WoW from Wreks message
since everyone where i look and everonye i ask is streaming for free
i'm at a loss, really
and also remember the fact that due to the content we're streaming, we can get shut down easily
Of course you are Octavia
Hellew Wrek
Hummm I'm sure I saw a decent free multi stream program the otherday.
that said
wait a second, Mantis
I'll show you the true quality of BronyState
...Once my computer finishes rebooting
http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/job-fails-tread-carefully.jpg
ok
oh, so who's streaming today?
i'm just having a hard time with your entire argument
2,14 that would be Sprinkles
since i watch on good quality everyday
Then I think it needed a lot of host side bandwidth. So doubt it would be any good.
oh okay
and i'm asking people right now and everyone is saying its free
Thanks, Sprinkles!
as I said
allow me to show you our true colors
Matnis, I'm having a hard time following your reasoning here, are you upset that the stream quality isn't better?
Mantis*
i'm not upset
i asked about it earlier and i got a load of excuses that noone makes in any other scene
that don't seem to hold up
well, who are these other people who claim these other sites are perfect and free?
look, the whole thing was me wishing i could watch this stream in better quality like i watch everything else
competitive gaming scene has been doing streaming longer than anyone, back before mogulus came out with the first easy service anyone can set up
6Mantis, we've already stated that we're working on the quality. Frankly, the quality you're watching right now is the emergency backup.
ok that's all i really wanted anyway
2,14 lol, the emergency backup of the emergency backup TO the emergency backup :P
ohai Sam Jackson and Gary Oldman!
just i was pulled into replying to stuff that wasn't correct
6Pretty much, Val.
http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/chatroulette-trolling-what-about-his-tail.jpg
Snoop dog?
I rarely watch everything at 1080p, its just not justifiable given the majority of stream sites and your average connection. The distinction for a /gaming/ site is usually that their computers are top of the line, occasionally have sponsorships, and they pay to have the convenience of a much better connection
These people really want to eat a cat
Sammy J in da hizzouse
6I'm running a 3 year old laptop from a cafe wifi, of course the quality isn't going to be BRILLIANT.
^
Bye Sam Jackson!
6Pimp Sparrow wins.
6Flawless victory.
Sam Jackson said almost nothing
Something about eating and that's it...
I'd be pissed of that copout if the shooter had not been Gary Oldman
eating the butt, no less. He's a very classy lad.
9okay
9Mantis
9get in here
k
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BurningRed
9and fullscreen that shit
Sam Jackson IS class.
Why kill the pimp?
Also, Elvis hallucination is Val Kilmer iirc.
that stream...is glorious
9this is not even the maximum quality we can do
9oh, the live-stream will be in this quality because I'll be advising Sumica
9however, in SD because he doesn't have Hub HD
9however, you see, there are many factors in streaming
9input size, output size, bandwidth on both viewer and streamer, and computer power on both as well
yeah i'm aware of this
9my streamers are still learning
but all i know is that other's do it on regular basis with no drama, which was why i asked :P

Is that Gary Oldman doing Jamaican accent?
9are you satisfied, then, Mantis?
Because we ended up with a female playing a male part
Because there are already 3 girls for every guy on this campus
Yes it is. He's a complete wigger in this movie.
And fewer guys go for plays than girls
So excited for S2... omfg...
That weirds me out so much...
yes, since all i ever wanted was a "working on it"
9but yeah, we know what we're doing. Just leave it to us
Oh Gary Oldman is so good!
Okay, then that's solved...
Gary Oldman is some kind of minor deity.

The Galilean moons are by far the largest objects in orbit around Jupiter, with the remaining 60 moons and the rings together comprising just 0.003 percent of the total orbiting mass
07so who's ready for more rocky horror?
/me is ready
ME :D
Dennis Hopper never asked for this
mybodyisready.jpg
TIIIIIIIIIIME WARP AGAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN

/me is ready to do the time warp
07let's do the time warp againnnnnnnnnnn

I didn't watch it yesterday, Luna
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
07omg pinkie!
Go there.
/me is ready, even don't know what for...
07did you see it before?
4I fucking love the scene with Dennis and Walken
Anypony who has never seen it?
Well, yeah, though it's been a while
4Best part of the film, if you ask me
I've never seen it before either
07any virgins in the house?
You are in for a treat
07RHPS virgins that is :D
whats wrong with the normal stream then?
*raises hand* why do you ask?
Someone threw lemons at it
Definitely watching it today, Luna!
sorry ^_^
07great !
?
Virginity is fun.
05Combustiblelemons someone threw a combustable lemon at it, dunno who...
They weren't combustible though <3
I was a virgin, but you fixed that for me last night ;D
I'd just like to say that today,I'm doing facts about the 64 moons of Jupiter
Dennis Hopper: Master Troll
huh, this is the same scene I came in on las night too.
inb4 nword
Jupiter's other 56 moons are irregular satellites, whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. There are 14 recently discovered irregular satellites that have not yet been named.
OOps I just read your full comment! I take back my raised hand
lol
Why don't you mods just change src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=AnOccurrenceatOwlCreekBridge&amp;vw=700&amp;vh=520&amp;" to src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520&" until the normal stream is back?
Are we popping any RHPS cherries tonight?
*this afternoon
Now we all have to edit it manually.
is anybody else having issues seeing the high quality stream?
Considering what that show is about,Sol is sounding very creepy
srilanga: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
I'll be back soon, off to get some pizza :D
which shall I get?
That's as high as it gets today.
Pepperoni and pineapple.
Now I want pizza.
lol
Well, it is very analogious to that
brb guys
Pepperoni and more pepperoni
I actually like pineapple pizza
Saying the N word more than 4chan
no it's http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=Gendum&vw=700&vh=520&
More than SRK
Bacon goes with everything.
bacon pizza? hmm...
Well, /b/ uses roody-poo because of filters
Which is impressive, because half the people on SRK are black and use it all the time.
I'll be back in half an hour- until then :P
SRK?
"I haven't killed anybody, since 1984"
The moons' physical and orbital characteristics vary widely. The four Galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets (Ganymede being larger than Mercury).
The year.... OR THE STORY?!!?
Oh god this is good drink!
Hello
RobotPinkie: Shoryuken.com, hub for the fighting game community.

You'll have plenty of time to post it...
The bidding actually went down on the Rainbow Dash mascot suit http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337#ht_1110wt_1270

It really was an amazing audition, changed my life.
Any Germans in here?
Hey, I saw that costume on a couple of forms before, its a shame I cant afford it
Caused me to stop drinking
too bad lauren's sketches weren't costumes
I don't like romantic movies (mfw back to the future 3) so I'm just reading the comments on here,will turn the stream on when we get to green is not your colour
I'm PART German.
OMG THE POWER IS BACK ON!
Y U NO WATCHING MOST BADASS MOVIE EVER!?
Someone who has a school mascot of a horse should wear that to one of their football games
Oh, well I guess that will do. I just got to sample Vita Cola, and it's BRILLIANT!
/me dances
How does he know that its real....
and also posting moon srivia
Oh wow, more True Romance again!
13Kinda funny the RD suit is up to $2500. I can commission one for less than that in maybe better quality.
Moving on to trivia about callisto btw
Forgive me for being so rude, hello everypony!
07hellp SuperBrony64
07hello*
07omg
It comes with a wingboner
/me is blind
If I have over 2.5 G to bid on that suit then I would do it
ohai SuperBrony64
YOU NEED HELP LUNA?!
13Hey SuperBrony64
Forgive me if thre are reference numbers in my trivia
Psh, you weren't rude :P Hey there
I'll SAVE THE DAY!
What the hell, I just checked that suit and it was in 3500
07yea please do
07too bright lights!
07aaaaah need more darkness
Lee Donnowitz is supposed to be descended from Donny Donnowitz from Inglourious Basterds.
Please skip this for Rocky Horror Show Plz kthnxbai
Callisto ( /kəˈlɪstoʊ/;[8] named after the Greek mythological figure of Callisto, is a moon of the planet Jupiter. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System and the second largest in the Jovian system, after Ganymede.
Fun Fact.
:P
13I'm guessing the people bidding on it arent familiar with suit commissioners and such lol
13And poor Luna. :(
I'm just surprised that the bid went down
And
I don't even make $2.5k a month.
mfw half of the people here have no idea about this
/me hugs Luna
13Someone retracted their bid must be or something
inb4 he gets a box of Dragon Dildos
Nor have that in the bank.
So, is there any particular reason why the Browny Show is doing a Season 1 marathon after you announced you were doing your own?
it must be a coincidence
http://sharetv.org/images/back_to_the_future/dr_emmett_brown-char.jpg
Yeah that must be it. The suit was yesterday up at 3600 and 18 bids
Because every Brony streaming site is
It's an obvious thing to do for season 2 premiere.
There was a bttf cartoon series btw
Yes there was, I liked it :3
For srs?
EmmettBrown I did not really care for that, but the movies are amongst my top ones
So, what's this bidding war everypony is talking about?
It was alright,kinda turned the car into a mary sue though
The Rainbow Dash Costume on Ebay SuperBrony64
Nothing bad ever really happened to it
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337
A halloween costume?
Nope, not just any old costume, you have to see it to believe it
Oh sheeeeeeeeet
That costume has wing boners
THAT costume
13Not a halloween costume
13lol
You can wear it in Halloween
That was my reaction when I first saw it
Best Halloween costume ever!
13You could. lol
>_<
13But its not specifically for Halloween
But it's a bit... furry
13>mfw some people dont know what furries are still
Eeyup
You can wear it for your Grad Bash
13Holy crap, The Brony Show has over 1000 viewers
But more importantly, if I spent that much for a costume, I would have to wear it everyday to school just to justify the price tag...
Imagine seeing that riding a roller coaster
dude this guy plays Artie in Warehouse 13.
>1000 viewers >I bet they have constant turbo chat
I just need to figure out how to make one of those costumes...
same here, maybe I should find some one that actually makes them
Not like in the canon series where it was crahsed into a barn,crashed into a cinema,had a rubbish ignition,had faulty time circuits,could only go to times between 0000 and 9999 ad,couldn't teleport,couldn't fly until the second one,was almost hit by a plane,backed into some bins,almost crashed into some flying cars going in the other direction,
If I was rich, that would be in my closet right now
Or on me...
Dat late response
Dat early response?
Thats only the first movie and a bit of the second movie
lol
The car was surprisingly tough
What is Floyd watching?
>mfw when my internet is so unstable that I cant watch a 0:29 vid on youtube without lagging :C
I'm a bit weird according to some since I like ponies and whatnot, but I don't think I'd wear that suit.
07Poor Zephirdd
Okay, who wants to place bets that the costume goes up past $5000 before the end of the auction?
07hope you get it sorted out before RHPS
Yo
Should I continue with the time machines flaws?
It's just today
wiat, whats RHPS?
Is it made of dark matter>
I magical opera
Great going Mr loose lips
I'm working on a design for a time machine.
Arn't you guys supposed to be streaming right about now? Or is my internet just being derpy :O
07We are streaming
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
Exactly like a ninja.
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum
ninja's
Back up stream
At the moment, I'm estimating that when it's complete it will be capable of propelling the operator and up to three passengers forward through time at a rate of one minute per minute.
And what a scene for you to jump into!
on MLP premiere day, will the stream be off site, or will it be in the field just to the left of this chat box?
one minute per minute
It's freaky Fred!
It will be in the field to the left of the chat.
thakns
*thanks
6We were having extreme tech problems today. XD
you can always put it fullscreen tho =p
Is that Tom Sizemore?
One minute per minute indeed.

When did the replay stream start? o-o;
07so.. for those who stayed after last nights show... how was the playlist?
i plan to make it fullscreen, but (and not complaining) the borders on the other stream make the actual movie kinda small
Luna, it was amazing
07it was?
Oh right, I was thrown off by the shadows/slightly laggy stream
It was good, I was dozing off a lot so I didn't watch most of it
07I believe I kept playing till 5 PM my time
I was only there for the after show stream
Luna: OMG, the ending of the playlist was brutal
07brutal?
And because Sizemore was supposed to be in this movie
why is stream down?
07my internet derped

07it's not even my list ;)
07it's just a list with over 200 vids
Bjornfot but the chat isnt there.
Luna: Okay then, the list had some bad remixes near the end
Beginning was good, but the end was just rape on the ears
It's gotten struck by lightening,driven by biff,struck by lightening again,got left in a mine for 65 years,got shot with an arrow,ripping the fuel line,pulled by horses over bumpy terrain,damaging it's suspension,had to share a cave with a bear pushed by a locomotive,crashed through a barrier,and hit by a train
07i'm sorry
07I can't edit it
Just pop out the chat from bronystate.net, sklar
sklar: edit the page HTML
07but if you suggestions we do have our own playlist too
Luna: It's cool, thanks for playing it all night though
I lol'd at driven by Biff.

EmmettBrown that last part might have done some damage
old biff as well
Luna: what's the link to the playlist?
I'm not even finished with it's punishment
Out to go work out
Bye Freeze
"Oh yeah, did I mention Elvis told to murder a pimp once?"
I'm pretty sure I'm mistaken, but is that Crispin Glover? Or whoever played Marty's dad?

No, that's not him.
it didn't crash did it?
OK, thanks
That guy should have killed Alabama instead of screwing around after he found the coke.
Thought it was William Sadler, but I guess not.
Hmm…I don't know whether or not to spoil myself with the marathon of MLP now or just wait for the all-nighter before Season 2 comes out...
Nvm, Bronyville show is just crapping out every given moment
He took that hit like a boss

So, what happened with the main site stream Luna?
You're a true bro

The trailers never showed any gameplay of the game.
No officer it was hers, she threw at me to frame me
/me has an idea for an End of Winter celebration
Director, Theatrical or Final?
Now that's Tom Sizemore
We should do a three-day showing fo the Toy Story Trilogy.
Great movie indeed
allisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only about a third of its mass.

Now it's a party
It's not a party till pinkie pie arrives
Well, it's not a party without pinkie. Anypony see her lately?
inb4 PinkiePie enters the room
Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.
I guess she's just being Pinkie Pie
And Dick Richie went on to become the single most celebrated actor in the history of film!
He got the part, well there goes that studios money
Ohey, Fluttershy is here too.
o-o I've been here kinda...
Fluttershy is being really shy :P
I mean... um
I am here...
I just... haven't really been talking... ^^; sorry...
Fluttershy's always here.
So many ponies, I wish they had seen the movie from the beginning.
flutterlurker?
um...
hey brownies
All the Mane 6 Ponies are lucky
Hiya Ziltoid.
They know what happens in Season 2 >_>
ohai Ziltoid
/me whistles the Back to the Future them tune
I'm not a bakery product
/me vanishes for a while
....to the new lunar republic...
so...who's the guy that hired these cops?
...
Fluttershy: Lunar republic…? IS THAT FROM SEASON 2!?! :O
the cops are just cops that somehow know about this cocaine
nope.avi
/me highhooves Fluttershy
They interrogated Elliot after he got busted. He told them the bs story Clarence told him.
how long's this movie been going?
>3> -highhooves Natleyn back-
A while
This is near the end
It's almost over.
There so much tension in this movie, so we decided to play some peaceful music...relax...
SuperBrony64: huh? o-o;
/me whistles the Thomas the tank engine them song
This show could only be more star-studded if it was Twilight's flank.
about 10-15 more minutes left
Yeah, what's up with this music?
The music makes sense at the end, kinda.
their music department had a low budget?
Fluttershy: You know, the second year that you are friends with the Mane 6
SuperBrony64: I mean... well, I know that... ^^; oh dear...
I still don't understand this scene
SB64, New Lunar Republic is an internet thing
Clarence knows somethings wrong, but he's a little too trusting of Elliot.
He thinks something is amiss due to his suspicious smile
I don't get it...
What the hell just happened?!
so he presses him with a gun to get him to talk
he lied.
SuperBrony64: Look it up... it's very fun. :3
Bong time
What just happened?
Fluttershy: The Lunar Republic?
Douche!
Clarence just happened.
Best part is when the one thug cocks the shotgun
Reminds me of my neighbour lol
Lunar Republic is best republic.
Heres a picture of Callisto http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Callisto.jpg

No wonder this guy doesn't have friends, he tells about there secrets and you all know that loose lips sing friendships

Um, question for the mods: during the viewing of Rocky Horror Picture Show, can we shout the lines that are usually shouted at late night viewings?
4I dunno, Dermathil
Can we have toast and squirt guns as well?
05"two bodybags"
hehehehe
Dermathil; What late night viewings?
He's descended from The Bear Jew from Inglourious Basterds.
SuperBrony64: the late night viewings of RHPS
the legendary viewings with the disguised people
Dermathil: They still have those? Is it like a cult?

Dermathil: I can't believe people are that dedicated to that movie to do stuff like that
This film has been brought to you by the letter F.
Shits about to get REAL.
HERE COMES THE GOOD PART!
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL
Now then, can anyone explain the guy in the gold outfit?
I missed the beginning
Toilet elvis
SuperBrony64, people have always done that kind of stuff. The audience participation is half the experience.
I think its the ghost of Elvis
The word of the day is Fuck kids
He's Elvis, he's Clarence's spiritual guide. (Clarence is a little crazy)
Dermathil: So you bring stuff to throw at the screen and shout random stuff?
Dermathil Ya, it's like "Sweet Caroline"
Well if you hate fucking cops, then just don't fuck 'em. Seems easy enough.
I wonder what the backstory for that was
Cops vs Body Guards vs Mafia, for people who haven't watch this place your bets!
It's like watching a Fuck-Shit stack on top of itself
Dermathil: Really? Do they still do this today?
ALWAYS bet on Clarence.
I dunno, maybe

Clarence will become big boss :P
Fluffy deaths everywhere.
Is this the part where we throw rice at the screen?
This isn't shit hitting the fan. This is the whole damn cesspool hitting it
RobotPinkie: you haven't seen Julius Caesar if you say that.
No, this is where we throw feathers
And bullets
Cops win.
I didn't see Clarence get shot.
Its only a flesh wound
It's raining feathers
THE GUY HIT THAT DUDE

So very John Woo.

Go there Scatr
Movies almost over
Then ponies
and delishuz RHPS
ah k
EspyLacopa, that's really awesome.
Dat Tarentino Monologue
taht's good cos i only came for rocky horror :3
"You're so cool."
I am seeing double of everything
>this part is stupid
"you're so cool"
Okay, PONY TIME
Imagine the entire pony episode in 3D.
>this part is awesome
Whoa
It needs to be 20% more cooler
lol elvis
I'd like to watch pony ep 3D
Brad pitt is big boss.
Even through I'm against 3D movies
ponies in 3d would basically be the same as 2d
I just killed my eyes watching that clip
given that they are 2d creatures
I can list the first 10 engines from thomas the tank engine in order of number :
05The rigging and anitmation needs to be solid. even slightly off and id prefer 2D
:D
05animation*
IMMMMMMAAA FIRUN MAH LAZOR
Scatr: BUT IN 3D
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S5aBzSBegoo/Tmu49tRdR3I/AAAAAAAAL4o/5tvlsrtrhOU/s1600/h1zC.jpg
Threeeeee-Deeeeee
I'm kinda pissed that I missed the first half of this movie
lol
Now it's really awkward when Clarence says "Elvis told me to kill a pimp."
I prefer 2D animation too.
scatr actually 2D stuff can look pretty good in 3D if done properly.
PONY TIME THEN TIME FOR ROCKY HORROR!
I have a feeling that someone is going to do a chocolate rain skit with that episode
true i guess
3D is significantly easier though- thats why there's more 3D cartoons out there.
actually 3d parasprites would be pretty freaky
darf14 as if they haven't already with the 3 screenshots we have of it.
Darf14: its a certainty after what seth said.
but if it was in 3d all the colours would be dark and murky and ponies is all about colour :<
Of course 2D is still the way to go, but for the novelty's sake I'd like to see one entire episode in 3D
I'm not talking about that. This 3D is the kind where the stuff actually pops out of the screen.
3DS 3D
05depends on the shader scatr
I could watch youtube cross eyes 3D whole pony ep
MLP on the 3DS would be really cool
WhatPayne: I'm sure your eyes would melt after that
i guess what i'm thinking of is the 3d in ceinmas where you pay bullshit amounts for stupid glasses
I want to get OoT on DS
but then imax 3d is way better
scatr that's if it's a 3D conversion. Proper 3D doesn't have the murky effect, that's why stuff like "How To Train Your Dragon" looks effing brilliant in 3D
so
For ponies I'd do it
Ocarina of time was my all time favourite :D
Pffffft, This needs no glasses.
Yeah that glasses stuff is bs
Combustiblelen: I've got that game on 3DS. Really awesome game, just like original except better >_<
It is? I'M GETTING IT :D
07I was wondering... why the chat was dead... my chat did not scroll down >:
wtb virtual reality ponies actually
lol luna
Glasses always darken the video, though it doesn't have to be by a whole lot.
i know that feel
It could be a delay luna
Thomas,Edward,Henry,Gordon,James,Percy,Toby,Duck,Donald,Douglas and Emily :p
The first 11 engines
So...how does the 3D work?
darf14 friendship
Magnets
3D is a trick of the eyes
This is Pinkie Pie's favorite show
I'm getting a 3DS when my old DS lite breaks
friendly magnets
Luna lol, this has happened to trixie before
Naw, 3D usually works through polarized light.
13 3D'S! How do they work?!
I'm nostalgic for the old days where you had red and blue lenses
afraid i don't really see it espy :<
Octavia: Magic
So my eyes have to be like Derpys eyes in order to see the 3D in that picture
colours are good obv
Which is soo,the top screen keeps turning off
the 3DS is weirdly awesome
How long till Pony episode starts?
unless you have one of those 3DTVs that require LCD glasses, then it works by alternating which eye can see something.
I want a 3Ds
who's streaming?
One thing that DIDN'T need to be brought back was that Aromascope stuff
Luna is I believe Combustiblelen
isn't the 3Ds the thing that melts your eyeballs
SirSprinkles is streaming, Combustiblelemons
Thought so.
scatr: If you want to believe that
ah thanks robotpinkie :P
its all going on the same stream channel right?
No scatr, you're thinking of the Virtual Boy
dw, i'd endure eyeballmelting to play a lylat wars update superbrony :3
lol
3DS reports are mostly of headaches.
Virtual Boy kicked ass and was killed off before it hit its prime
that too natleyn
VirtualBoy did work by melting your eyeballs, true
anyone who's ever tried one can confirm this
I've never tried. I always wondered what they were like
I'll keep my old DS then I think :P
I own one and can't confirm this RobotPinkie :P
SuperBrony64 = You trollin?
Dat cone
for some reason I'm having trouble concentrating on my NaPoWriMo fic today.
I hate it when games consoles go down in price
3DS is great, though.
like 1 week after you brought it
the picture I linked? Look at it crosseyed until you see extra versions of the two parts in the middle, then focus on the single middle image.
Riders: Hell no, I'm dead serious, the 3D effect was not that bad
big respect for anyone doing napowrimo
Waiting for a certain game until I actually buy a 3Ds
You have a virtualboy, SuperBrony64, and you don't think it's headache inducing?
that shit's hard even when you can write at a decent rate
Just joined, what are we watching?
robot: whatdimensionhavewestumbledinto
I've played a virtual boy before. It was graphically hideous and was a horrible eye strain
okay, you're one of the exceptions, then. I couldn't play for a minute without my eyes tearing up.
We are watching a traffic cone
/me is watching a traffic cone
I very rarely get headaches
^
centigrade: nothing atm, ponies next, then TIMEWARP
(rocky horror)
3DS is fine, though, just don't overdo the 3D slider
07Let's do the timewarp againnnn
great
now that song is stuck in my head
its just a jump to the left!
RobotPinkie: Nope, it makes your eyes tired after a while but not melt your eye balls
Seems everything epic is coming out this september :D
I think I'll skip Rocky Horror today. It was fun for a bit, but just started getting boring after a while
lol you thought I literally meant it melts your eyeballs?
I really like the 3DS' 3D effect better though
^
6So... Green Isn't Your Color is up next.
3DS isn't painful at all
I watched a little bit of rocky horor last night ._. It was so weird...
RobotPinkie: No lol, I'm saying that it doesn't kill your eye sight unless you are really young
07rocky horror is amazing
Meh. not a fan of green isn't your color
I'm not even sure how it's a horror movie...
nintendo: we can't work out how, but the general consensus is that eyeballs will be melted at some point
who needs eyeballs anyway?
they're overrated if you ask me
It was fun to watch though
I don't plan on getting a 3DS. I'm sticking with my DS Lite and it's GBA slot thanyouverymuch.jpg
I'm not saying it kills your eye sight either, but it is a constant strain
Lucky_Charms, if you don't have eyes then you don't get to see Ponies
Nintendo: We are currently building a consensus. Please try again later.
as am I RAWRity
Disregarding the mind rape
...true :-(
Rocky Horror was good at the beginning, but it get progressively...um....odd
lawl
lol Bjornfot
FABULOUS HAT
3DS isn't, unless you've got the 3D slider set too high
GBA slot is genious.
But Nintendo is really pulling an epic fail out of their hat with what they are doing with the 3DS
oh look, ponies!
Goodbye.
I was only after the 3DS for Megaman Legends 3. Now that Capcom can go fuck themselves, I have no reason to buy it.
Whuh? How is 3DS epic fail?

Pony time!
*squee*
This has been confirmed by Nintendo to be real
13She saw my hat and said it was absolutely hat!
this episode is one of the best, mostly because of photo finish
Been idle for a long time because schoolwork, but re: 3DS - the problem I have with it is that often (for me at least) is that I stop noticing the 3D unless it starts doing strange things
05*SQUEE*
Oh look the 3Ds just grew a tumor
Looks like 3DS is starting down the path of the Sega Genesis.
Dat please
octavia: Rarity would love TF2
So that's an official addon?
Correction, the Sega Game Gear
THE USUAL!
Silverscreen: That thing reminds of the monstrosity I got for my game gear.
Rarity = best customer ever
Aloe and Lotus <3 Rarity
It's only 'cause they're adding another analog anyway...
Do you remember how many add-ons they made for Genesis?
RobotPinkie: Indeed, it is being revealed officially September 13th at a 3DS Press Conference
Sega CD?
The ancient surface of Callisto is one of the most heavily cratered in the solar system
At least three
Wait, why a third movement control?
Oh god the GameGear sucked
Well.... that sucks
Masochspike!
they also had the ingenious idea of connecting cartridges XD
Lets see, the Sega CD, 32X...those are the ones I remember from the top of my head
Sega CD, Sega 32X (or whatever it was called) and an adapter for SMS systems IIRC
I don't get it either, doesn't the touch screen work just fine?
I think Nintendo is having an identity crisis with the 3DS
Why does Fluttershy look like a burlesque dancer
Fluttershy hates spike
I still have a GameGear...

awesome.
360, PS3, ect: two analogs, dpad
Combustiblelen: No, she loves Baby Dragons :P
05yfw i dont own any kidn of console
But the DS has a touch screen that functions as a second analog.
she got to know spike, now she hates him.
OMG
consoles are srs bsns
SPOILER ALERT GUY
GUYS*
(< pc gamer)
Foreeeeevarrrr
Yeah, but the 360 and PS3 don't have a touch screen.... I mean 3D shooters work much better that way.
*gasp*
And thus a meme was born
FOTO FEENEESH
Anyone else nostalgic for the GBA?
I never would've expected that
<3 Photo Finish
Oh hi Rainbow Dash
I'm born again PC gamer
Now
<3 Flootershai
photo finish is underrated D:
I still play my GBA, Combustiblelemons
No!
YES!
05mhyees
NO!
YES!
I keep forgetting to buy batteries for mine D:
ENOUGH
Photo Finish should show up in season 2, at least her theme song should.
I have a GBA SP, yay!
more ponies with euroaccents are required for season 2
I do too, I can't remember where I put it though
just need to plug it in to charge it, ooh yeah
because they're always done so ridiculously over the top
We Go!
Lost my charger for my SP D:
Rarity Smile!
I still have an original GBA, I had to buy an awkward light for the screen.
I still have my SP, but the battery only last about a hour and thirty minutes
I GO
You can buy a new charger really cheap, though, Combustiblelemons
Ow ow ow ow
I'd say it's worth it.
Thanks RobotPinkie :)
I bet- after seeing a GBA on sale for £2 at a car boot sale
I haven't charged my SP in years and it still turns on. <3
Whenever I see Photo Finish, I can't NOT see her as a disguised Rainbow Dash
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48918?search=rainbow_dash%20photo_finish Thanks to this comic
Pokemon Emerald, Link to the Past, Castlevania games, oh yeah!
haha, I know right @Purple`Prose
Pokemon emerald FTW.

I need to buy FF6 for GBA though...
The last Pokemon game I last played was silver for the GBC
Camera Flash Burn
I bought pokemon white. I got to some city and saw a dress up game. after that I ragequit

Watching the Penn State v. Alabama game is depressing.
it is good - it's not amazingly written but it's really really entertaining and it's a good story done well

6XD
...What the hay. Disgaea crossed with My Little Pony?
6Just real quick during our little intermission here guys.
4...I really wanna play the new Deus Ex
4Fucking criken, I had no interest in the game until I saw his video -_-
4And now I want to play it
6First off, we will be streaming all of Season One next week, starting after the stream on Friday night, so that it will end on Saturday before the new season airs.
6Secondly, I'd like to point out for those of you who do not already know.
6That we are now on our own new, permanent domain.
6At http://www.bronystate.net
07yay!
2,14 Hurray for domains!
07Also a marathon! so much ponies!
2,14 Stay up with us.....FOOORRRREEEEEEVEEEERRRRR
6And, as we've taken a little trip across the internet, we'd like to think of it... as our own little BronyQuest.
2,14 inb4 toot
Ghosties: Exactly the same thing happened to me.
I never asked for this
Toot
TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT

You're welcome ValtheJean
Damn it criken.

This is new?
/me 4is tempted to just go by Gamestop today and pick up a copy
this one is good
13Dat Flutterguy
I'm more than tempted to pick up a copy
no
How is this? http://s902.photobucket.com/albums/ac223/CCXIII/Minecraft%20Bronies/
Ghosties: You should pick up a copy of Star Fox 64 3D
this one's pretty well done actually
if only my ps3 wasn't only 40gig :/
/me 4does not own a 3DS
He should get a copy and DO A BARREL ROLL!
I have had my Deux Ex sitting right next to me in wraps as I have been pushing playing it until my new RAM arrives...
Meh I just want to kill people with vending machines.
Ever since it's release
and no pinky trumpet in sight!
oh
wait
disappoint
Ghosties: :<
No feed back?
Also, stealth games are generally epic.
Case and point: MGS series.
rofl louder
4But this is different, you guys
(this is when toot comes in right)
4I can just punch people FOR NO REASON and there's an epic animation for it
You can't bait me with MGS talk Combustiblelemons! I see Ghosties in chat...
MGS

13MY LITTLE PONY!
I'm not getting a broadcast.

Recommend to everyone- get MGS4. It's not too late.

I am impressed that someone only took small sound clips from different part and was able to make a song out of it
6It's just intermission, dude, we're going to the next ep now.
thirding
13Scootaquest <3
4Indeed
4MGS4 is art
<3
That was fun
13That chicken sure gets around I tell ya
it's like half movie half game.
And it does it SUCCESSFULLY.
i just had reheated applecake superbrony
I have MGS4.
inb4 MeatLoaf
4My only complaint is that there wasn't more action. However, the ending completely made the entire effort worth it
WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYinb4 MeatLoaf
Luna o3o
I need to get another hi-def TV.
O hai woona
4It was like 10 years of build up finally coming to a neat wrap
Maybe I'll go and buy one today.
Since its a half movie half game make sure you get popcorn
Oh hai Luna. How's your sex life
dat The Room
inb4Don't use your fancy mathmatics to muddle the issue
Sound is choppy.
wat?
It also tied up all the weird crap in MGS2
Screw math!
Ohey there's going to be MGS HD collection
I haven't finished MGS4.
13>muddying up the issue with dem fancy mathematics
Even if it kills me...
what are you stuck on nittany?
And finally I get to play Peacewalker
GOOD LUCK DUMB SHIT
Can't play MGS4 for one sole reason...no PS3
I'm not stuck. Just haven't picked it back up.
:( poor darf14
>mfw i realised that this is the reason Big Mac is so good at accounting in that hueg fic
Can't really play it on a CRT TV because I can't read the text.
The only MGS game I ever played was the remake released from the GC
Darf14, that can be problematic
The end of part 4 of MGS4 is epic.
Oh, Daf what have you missed...
*Darf
inb4chineseearthquake
awww.
I'm on Act 2.
ebrbrbrbrbrbr
Act 4 is my favourite act.
CAPTAIN BACKWOODS TO THE RESCUE
Act 3 is my least favourite.
No spoilers.
Spoilers in MGS are fatal to gameplay.
I won't spoil it for you :P
is there a low-quality option on the veemi.com stream?
Like spoilers killed KOTOR for me.
doncha know
Just saying, you'll love part 4.
I still need to play MGS4
Phew, almost got caught -_-;
Caught watching ponies? No fear for me tonight :D
yes
No roommate, no problems.
I live alone for now.
and I love MGS: Twin Snakes, Darf14
I'm watching Thomas the tank engie on youtube :p
I'm watching ponies with headphones so I don't bother my brother, but I'm not hiding that I'm watching.
inb4 I Came Paper
SO AWESOME
6 /)^3^(\
My brother is going to live with me for a while. It's going to be interesting when he learns about my bronyism.
Cut scenes directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Oh yeah.
damn it sprinkles D:
Good thing I only keep my pony stuff on a different Partition
thing about pony stuff and other people finding out is
Dat Grin
KANYESHY
13I CAME PAPER!
Ohai Mayor
that it's legitimately a good cartoon. so if they're open minded enough to watch it in the first place, they're probably open minded enough to like it
Lol
The only "open" pony stuff I have out is my PS3 theme, and it won't show up for my brother.
My dad's out right now, and my mom's going to be in England for the month, so I could use my speakers if I wanted to, but I don't feel like it cause I prefer headphones
SHE'S GONE
Unless he logs in as me.
and it's getting big enough for people to be less "lol ponies???" because they're probably heard of it. so it's not as big a deal as it used to be imo
This is the SECOND time Mayor Mare lost the guest of armor
It was proposed that it could be possible to build a surface base on Callisto that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.[54] Advantages of a base on this moon include the low radiation (due to Callisto's distance from Jupiter) and geological stability.
honor*
they've*
But he's not interrupting my Friday BMN.
New lunar republic is discreet enough for me :P
Wooo wooo!
whoo whoo
4<Combustiblelemons>: The end of part 4 of MGS4 is epic
4What he said
6High?
AppleJack has got to lay off the AppleJack *punched*
EmmettBrown, you're really on with the Callisto thing, aren't you?
Nobody knows its pony related except for a real brony.
Beware the smooze, AJ.
EmmettBrown: I hope we do before we fry ourselves with overloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.
Got it's wikipedia page open on nother tab and everything
every pony is best pony whenever they undergo a mental breakdown
In a December 2003 report, NASA expressed belief that an attempt for a manned mission to Callisto may be possible in the 2040s
Everypony is best pony at all times forever. @.@
NASA can't get the money to get back to the moon.
Pinkie so far has the best mental breakdown scatr
I really do wish humanity would really expand to space.
I know Combustiblelemons
agreed darf
*mankind
Of course,living on Callisto would be harder than living at the south pole
Humanity wants to bitch over resources on Earth to have them in the here and now.
And the US govt can't get along to fix the economy.
>invest money in space travel
MOON TOURISM.
>resource problems over.
I really want to visit L2
Convince humanity that.
but... wouldn't rainbow be launched *into& the tower
Anyway,that's Callisto triviafied
onto Europa
:Cheaper to continue using resources on Earth. Screw space travel.
Physics details.
pff
4 fails in a row
Europa or Jupiter II, is the sixth closest moon of the planet Jupiter, and the smallest of its four Galilean satellites, but still one of the largest bodies in the Solar system.
You're Whale Cum!
Oh no, Dash died :(
Dash is blasting off agaaaaiiin!
There's a zoo near Ponyville, confirmed.
I wonder if there's a petting zoo with ponies
yeah i was just wondering what the implications of a zoo in equestria would be
Twi DGAF about rainbow dash.
given that every animal is either rampaging through the everfree forest or in the care of fluttershy
Equestrian petting zoos have humans.
more or less
Who's a silly pony?
And mules.
lol nittany
You are, Purple`Prose!
Applejacks caught the derp
volunteers wanted for human petting zoo - meet real ponies

Maybe fluttershy lives at the zoo?

Bjornfot knows everything
They're ponies bjornfot ^_^
I love how The Mentally Abridged Series passes this episode off as AJ having a drinking problem.
It's like an upside down turtle with a protruding shell
we have horses, darf14
2,14 Ponies also can't cast magic or fly

Wrek: o_o really?
Mule: "Biding our time for the revolution."
Applejack: Pick up that can.

Not really the point.
But it isn't PG-13.
Never needed no help from nopony no-how, not till now.
AJ's face then reminds me of happy tree friends.
13Big Mac = Trololol
Dang, looks like I am behind the stream again
I will save that quote for future usage.
Big Macintroll

so... how big mac got his injury
he lost a bet
but we don't know what the bet was?

If you've seen Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it's about 10 times more surreal
The reaction from the viewers when he showed a clip of someone slapping themself in the face with a horse dick was classic.

The Dead Island trailer was 3x better than the actual game
And just when you thought the movie couldn't get any more strange...
Riders: Agreed.
Bjornfot, it's about to get about 40% worse for a final time
Emmett is 90 years old?
Here comes the strangest part!

RHPS is pretty popular, probably is an old PMV
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=Gendum backup stream
I could do the time warp all inght
night*
Is 3 weeks considered old?
/me does the time warp again
In internet time, yes
hey, can I get a link to the time warp pmv?
SQURIT GUNS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3skUmfydYU
Time is a part of the measuring system used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change such as the motions of objects.
before the gala. Definitely.
i still don't get where the time warp actually cam in, but then i barely followed the plot at all
came*
On the net 3 weeks is old, a year is ancient
Not THAT old! Only August
the gala had tons of useful PMV footage.
Do we have PMVs of EVERY SONG IN RHPS?
We need to watch Legend.
I wonder where Bjornfot went.
It has unicorns and Tim Curry.
Epic win.
90s is Paleolithic
On the net 3 months is old.
60s is big bang
3 weeks is average.
Anything before that is never mentioned
Bjornfot went to clean up bits of his brain that exploded from watching the movie probably
The ponies celestia fired from her moon cannon are returning!
Oh.
and horn guy Dari
dont forget him
where are the requests to be put in^
No no. Nightmare Moon is the Dr. Frank'n'Furter
Can I assume this channel is completely crazy for ponies?
hey, back, so are we doing reqeusts, or is this playlist?
Frankfurter = Princess Molestia?
THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!BEE-YATCH!
#Vinyl_Scratch I believe Dermathil
not sure if I should marathon MLP tonight
chefMKT you can assume that this channel is completely crazy anyway
Princess Molestia would be the weird, yet seducing one?
herospirit is right in my opinion.
Super robot night tonight?
Be back later Bronies
Combustible, wait til next week
Who could be Riff Raff?
Seeya Riders.
herospirit Braeburn?
Spike?
good point derma
Thomas was a really useful engine
MFW Legend also has someone trying to bring about endless night by killing two unicorns.
Ohhhh noooooooo. THIS SONG

RARITY IS A HUGE SLUT.
Flootershy is Columbia

11...
Also, nothing, and I mean nothing is worse than Rebecca Black's Friday.
but ponies makes 8everything* better
even rebecca black
OH FK THIS IS THE FULL SONG
11I hate to sound like a hater...but this singer's voice is annoying.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Everypony's Russian!
better rebecca black is still rebecca black
Did this song just become slightly more tolerable?
Polka Friday plox
DARF SMASH!!!
Oh is that song, I think this is the first time I heard it.
MY HAND IS A DOLPHIN!
/me nukes his headset
^
Change the song?
Not going to lie
I can't stop laughing oh my god you guys
this reminds me of "Friendship is Witchcraft" where they have Pinkie playing a polka version of friday
Not even ponies can make this song cool.
I feel Rapidash right now
11CombustibleLemons: Exactly.
MUST MOCK REBECCA BLACK'S CHORUS VOICE!
6EVERYBODY'S RUSSIAN
PLEASE, CELESTIA SWITCH IT TO AUTOTUNE
Whoever made this didn't even put any thought to the clip usage either
Even with Ponies it cant make the song better!
It's Fry Day!
everyone's seen that friday parody I take it
11Hell, I'd prefer hearing the Chipmunks sing this.
Throw them in a car and drive it off of a cliff!
Today it is void rays
Did she fried egg?
So what was the big deal about this?
>mfw when i still haven't heard her new song
My moment?
> Sunday
after listening to it so many times it's like rickroll
> After Saturday
you don't mind it.
what's sad is, Rebecca Black isn't this awful a singer. They actually autotuned her OUT OF TUNE.
i think so nittany, don't remember what it's called
Correction Rebecca, today is Sunday
It's called My Moment.
Yeah it's bad but not oh my god I must kill it with fire bad.
Autotune = You shouldn't be singing
Yeah, she can actually sing, which is weird.
^
damn it
^
Friday has awful lyrics.
I mean Saturday *facehoof*
Sounds like they are using Sarah Palin
T-Pain makes Auto-Tune cool at least
LAWL
And is part of the most corporate-controlled genre in the industry.
@-R-Zach yes
And Auto-Tune The News
>mfw they pulled the original Friday vid with millions of views.
Funny how many people call me Zach at times
They pulled it?
Friday has millions of dislikes.
:o
Yeah
i knew that they turned off comments rawrity but i didn't realise they got rid of it
Old news Combustiblelemons
The dislike bar was red a a pimple about to blow like a volcano
Rebecca Black pulled the video and then offered it as pay-per-view.
So conflicting... on the one hand this is awful
Y SO SERIOUS?
but on the other hand, ponies
Y U SO SERIOUS|

BEST PART OF THE FILM
SMOOOOZE
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
Lol
NOOOO
grimdark smooze fanfiction
NOWAI
What.
as it overruns ponyville and claims the lives of most of the mane 6. NOTHING CAN STOP THE SMOOZE
maybe this will make more sense in context next week?
smooze, good gosh I still remember there names
The smooze is horrifying when you stop and think about what it is and does.
Bjornfot knows his stuff. BEST PART RIGHT THERE
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
11...
11okay...
Ending:
Smooze, the retarded cousin of Muck
THEY ALL DIE.
11what the fuck were they thinking when they came up with this?
I already wrote a couple Grimdark paragraphs about the Smooze
This is pretty grimdark
EspyLacopa, that's why it would look fking epic if remade by the fim team. Just let that think.
Lets kill them all!
11Better yet, what the fuck were they smoking? I'd like some.
Think of it remade in the new art style.
You want to have the Smooze in your head Silver?
They wanted a non threatening bad guy that was easy to draw Silverscreen
They were smoking some smooze.
I... I'm glad I'm a pegasus
Me too
^
Me three
I'm getting bored.Maybe gonna play some L4D2,or TF2.But not right now.
Natleyn: Good thing Pegasi can stand on clouds, eh?
Advantage, Pegasus Pony
I'm glad I own a hot air balloon
11Sumica: So they went with Grimer's retarded cousin?
Silverscreen: they made a [SPOILERS] blow up to make the smooze. And even in the G1 style it looked FKING AWESOEM
UMAD smooze?
They just have to worry about starving to death when the smooze eats all the food on the ground.
Better than drowning, imo.
Yep, time line wise they may have inadvertently designed pokemon.
ok no more pony tonight, bye guys, thanks for the stream and chat!
11...
Bye, scatr
/me 11suddenly wants a Cellblock Tango in Ponies.

Bye scatr

NAtleyn, the smooze is like a mudslide 25 meters thick. yeah.
Holy crap that sounds like a Twilight and Nightmare Moon duet
The smooze is a shoggoth.
Suddenly Duet
/me cries
/me hugs Luna
MLP: The Musicle
Ok,seeya everypony.Have a good night!I'll be here tommorow.

bye Pegacorn
Flutteryay: Defying Gravity

HAPPY B-DAY NEWDCD, WHEREVER YOU ARE
The rules of brawling like a man state that playing as Marth is unmanly, and breaking the rules, accidentally or otherwise, require you to suicide.
11And a very merry unbirthday to everypony else!
Happy birthday also, NewDCD! :3

But of course.
Saw it yesterday too. lol
I demand Rainbow factory PMV
Oh no, its the Sesame Street like song! If you want to preserve your childhood hit mute!
ಠ_ಠ
Funny cause to fandom RB is homosecual
rainbow_dash that's why only unicorns get to enjoy ice cream cones
Ah, Avenue Q.
oohhhhh this!
It's not even, "Who can we ship RD with?", it's "/What/ can we ship RD with?"
11Where is this from?
If you were Gay ~~ That'd be okay ~~ I mean cuz hey ~~ I like you aaanyway
It's okay to be Takei.
This song is addressed at you 4Kids
Avenue Q
11Sounds like something I'd hear on Bob and Tom show.
Dash, LOL so true
07Avenue Q
jk
silverscreen Avenue Q
11Never heard of that.
Sweet Luna
it's a broadway stage show...with PUPPETS!
The amount of nostalgia in Super Filly
13Theyre an awesome musical group
From that picture,we can detirmine that the engines are take apart (which feels like having your legs,arms and skin torn off) when they are no longer useful
It's Sesame Street for adults
megas xlr
yepo
It's a musical
Eeyup
lol
aeiou

this show was awesome
YES
Ouchers
SCHADENFREUDE

11Schadenfreude
Somepony should make a broadway of that with the pony costumes from ebay.
GERMAN WORD I CAN'T SPELL
RAAA
this is really nice
I love this song.
This song taught me how to spell Schadenfreude
neponig that would make it stop being funny, and make it start being terrifying
GILDA CAN GO ROT IN HE
HELL*
Indeed
She made my darling cry T_T
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB_9W9csP8k
14I will roast gilda over a friggin open fire ಠ_ಠ
LOL CELESTIA
Indeed
lol, Problem Bronies?
inb4 colors 4 mods
RAWRity yeah, true, sorry
Meh, I don't care how Gilda Acts
I didn't like Gilda's voice.
I thought Trixie was worse, tbh
inb4 shitstorm
11...
silver screen it's the streaming or is my connection that is working bad??
11This...this song makes too much sense.
Is seth listening?
This song makes sense
what ghosties said
Trixie was obnoxious, but at least she was entertaining with her bullshit. Gilda was just a jerk because kicks.
That is the magic of Avenue Q
Seth is always listening
oops silverscreen*
11MegaPony: It's probably your connection.
tragedy is when i stub my toe comedy is when you fall off a cliff and die
I think Trixie would be very hot if she kept her whore mouth shut
Sol I hated Trixie in the show, the fandom made me love her :P
ok thanks
If Sethisto is listening. I have a request for him.
=P
Go watch it Silverscreen, I think you'd like it. There's a camrip on YT IIRC
RDash: me too! :D
OK, there are some fanfics that make me like Trixie
I hate when fanon influences people. >_>
I don't like trixie. Never will like her.
lol
man
this is my fav
yeah me too
Gilda had a right to be that way, she hadn't seen RD for a really long time and wanted some time alone, and Pinkie Pie was being annoying :s
lol
What do you do with a B.A. in English/
as do I dari :/
LOL
LET'S WATCH OLD THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE EPISODES]
Paid for this
Easy: firewood
Actually,I typed the wrong show
/me 11smacks EmmettBrown
Neponig that's a terrible excuse
Silverscreen, heh
I meant to say "Teletubbies"
11no
neponig yeah, she really wanted to be along with RD, that's why she shouted at Fluttershy over an accident when she was alone.
I hate when fanon influences people too
Cake moster
Silverscreen, you can't just keep smacking people!
Friendship is Magic!
/me 11smacks SuperBrony64
Ouch
hahaha
inb4 someone else gets smacked
/me attaches to Silverscreen and explodes
/me slaps Silverscreen around a bit with a large trout
Fanon made Pinkie a sociopath >:
IT SUCKS TO BE ME!

IT SUCKS TO BE ME!
IT SUCKS TO BE ME!
/me 11grabs onto Nittany_Tiger.
Dashite NOOOOOO
It sucks to be Spike

Cupcakes is fail... and it is a SHAME! A SHAME! that that piece of DIRTY DIARRHEA WAS EVER PUBLISHED
inb4 Flutterfuck
I have acute Silverscreen
You read it? Didn't you?
Fluttershy is being a troll
haha
I think it's feeding off of me.
Flutteryay: sorry bro, while it is a really bad concept, the writting was brilliant
it's NOT a shame
11Nittany_Tiger: I hate it when they use Self Destruct. :P
Silverscreen, I hope you arent a zombie. I have been playing Dead Island for 2 days
Everyone's life sucks in some way

Ironing your underwear lol
What do you think of it DecapKing?

...Its ok to be me.
Wait, I mean..... what fic?

lawl rarity is asian
YOUR RIVES SUCK? I HEARING U CORRECTRI?
Really, Cupcakes is more ridiculously hilarious than scary or creepy. Then again, it's hard to scare me after seeing "A Serbian Film" and "I SPit On Your Grave"
It sucks to be Gary Coleman
Suckasuckasuckasucka-
Sucka sucka sucka.
OLD THUNDERBIRDS EPISDOES!
What is this based on?
Avenuq Q
Avenue Q*
Gary Coleman?
Stories don't scare me easily. Visuals and music are key to scaring me
AND NOW I'M DEAD
sol then DON'T watch "A Serbian Film"
IT SUCKS TO BE YOU!
If I ever see Gary Coleman, I'd tell him that
Trust me, I won't. I hate horror
Just to mess with him
Newborn Pr0n. lawl
The moral, All our lives suck
superbrony64 tell him that in hell, seeing as he's dead.
so be happy
.
I know how to talk to Gary Coleman *pulls out soul golve* stand still...
Oh right, forgot *facehoof*
Haha
I like older horror film. Like the original dracula

That fast?
Dang.

There are 3 things I love.

:P
The guy who sung this deserves +9001 internets.
Which are?
07House MD!
07Who!
BJORN MADE THIS?!
they dont include cupcakes right?
"Ballad of autumn dreams" is really nice too.
Matt Smith
Dari's first love is Matt Smith
what are the other 2 things?
Dude, you are even truer bro
IMO this song would be better with a female singer
Can anyone find that video from Russell Howards good news with the horse dick?
Dash, Polarfire, and Tennant. :P
but thats just an opinion
trolololol
07Polarfire :o
07omg
I think I'm falling in love with you, Bjornfot

Space bear!

LET'S WATCH OLD THUNDERBIRDS EPISODES :D
for science
dat ending
must
resist
Fin.
temptation
/me hugs Luna
/me HUGS LUNA
LUNA HAS JOINED PRINCESS CELESTIA'S PARTY
"Will you accept my friendship?"
"NO!"
LET'S WATCH NEW THUDERCAT SERIES
aww that scene is so awesome
why is luna half the size of celestia?
Luna gets hugs everyday?
:S
lets watch something epic
I think the infection stunted her growth
Sadly that moment was short lived when Celestria used the moon canon on luna
Luna gets hugged
there's som damn good screamo out there. Like Orchid, Pg.99, and Amanda Woodward
whenever we remember to hug Luna
Yes R-Zack
You can all go fav it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JafGnlH6jXU
/me hugs Luna
The moon is smaller than the sun
1,000 years on the moon- is not fully grown.
Hope you like bananas.
Doesn't it feel a bit tedious for her at times
Celestia has too much growth hormone...
Yay~
what is this.
Not this again.
>_>
:P
Celestia has been taking steroids?
arrg this gets everywhere
haven't heard this before D:
MP3'd this song
this is Flutterwonder
No, growth hormone
This is meh.
thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou
...Name of song, anypony?
I was so glad when FLuttershy actually got her own song.
Flooterwunder
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqo53-pNxsE
Yay!
Dari wants live action ponies, not this
Flutterwonder.
Luna just got younger due to the fact she grew up with a bitter heart.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599xiSGk2NM
As TIME himself reversed her.
Anyone know how to get the blank flank ending in Super Filly Adventure?
Lets listen to Something Broke by George DesRoches because 20 min story songs are awsome
To the most previous part when she was not evil.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSO0JQdyM8s&feature=related.jpg
meh I prefered nightmare moon
I wonder if theres gonna be a song in the S2 premier
she had an awesome design
herospirit you can only get it between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. Talk to everybody multiple times, just don't go to the party after all invitations are given, then go to Zecora
That would be so awesome
...luna's still good though :L
So much meh in this room
Luna's awesome
Why wub Wuna
Lol @ Sol
Wait, between 11:00 and 5:00?
yes.
LOL sol
@Sol that just made my day
ARRG
I love you, sol
How do I get the secret ending in Luna Game?!
Dark matter butterflies!
Herospirit, change your system time, and prepare yourself a new pair of pants
somebody went through the code for it and found that stipulation
so is this Fluttershy night
Pony House makes everything better
doctor house ^_^ yay!
I'll just wait until 11:00 I guess.
Why wub Fwuddershy
Fluttershy is best pony
Welll.... nah I'll change my clock
2:00 AM.
>Everypony is best pony
deal with it
I agree
true that
Dash is best pony.
Deal with it.
Dash will always be #1 for me ^_^
i guess there is no requests
Well, most ponies are best pony
I exclude ponies like Prince Doucheblood
Is the ending THAT frightening Dashie?
Any bad ends in the VN?
Dash is overrated imo
the "how abooouut" gets annoying in a short space of time for me.
Dari, I just don't know how you keep managing to misspell Rarity
herospirit it IS pretty messed up.
Phew, what a day.
Hello everypony
Sounds fun Rawr
hi AllisZero

Hi Allis!

MFW I'm the only one who doesn't like stuff like this.
/me hopes RobotPinkie is happy with his REQ being played
ohay AllisZero
Zephirdd: is right
Hi RP
Bought the car, finally
it's called "Pinkie Pie Swear-Trixie's good side"

/me explodes twice and retires to a dark corner
4Best Sonic music, what is it?
[02:19] <Ghosties> Best Sonic music, what is it?
Sonic Boom? Ghosties
it's kind of amazing how much has been done with the limited amount of Trixie footage
Ghosties; Green Hill Zone, otherwise it wouldn't have gotten 23 million remixes like it has
Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
:P
11I can die faster than you.
11hmm
I can watch ponies longer than you!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh, I get it
RAWRity Trixie does talk a lot in that episode though :P
Okay, I should probably go now. Bye everypony
It sounds more like Dash
11I have to go with original Sonic 1 music.
Best Sonic music? Mystic Cave Zone.
Adurrhurr I feel slow
I can ponies more than you.
MYSTIC FUCKING CAVE ZONE
4Actually, I was asking for best track in a Sonic game
Wow this is annoying
4Any Sonic Game
As shit
4*game
This is why I love you, RobotPinkie.
11Green Hill Zone. It's the first thing you hear and it sticks with you.
IT IS ON
Angry sex?
Ice Cap zone has the best music
A ROCK!?!?!

Well, almost every Sonic game has amazing music anyways, so...
