Bon Jovi

anything by OK go
I did that about 2 years ago lol, I bought 2GB of the wrong kind of RAM for my laptop.. never bothered to get an RMA for it.
all lack analogue synthesizers
yeah that was dumb of me
and are immediately unworthy
It happens though.
If a band requires synthesizers
Asus P5QL/EPU Mobo, 6gb RAM (@1066mhz) 1gb ATi Radeon HD 5670, Intel E47000 (shitty) 250gb SATA 7200 Primary, old IDE 80gb secondary.

if a band requires guitars...

but the animation and characters were fantastic

I still need to watch 9, it looked cool.
This is going to give me nightmares isn't it

Poe is among my favorite people..
my dormmates keep giving me odd looks

YES
And saw a yellowish horse.
YESSSS
/me spells apology wrong.
whenever someone walks into my dorm and sees my brushable collection
they get this awkward look
I think I'll go try this "sleep" thing
I choked for a second because my mind immediately put Fluttershy on the TV
/me waits for the RD solo.
I was like
it's hilarious
Night all
OHMYGODFLUTTERSHYISREAL
And you yelled Fluttershy!
Ponies, Ponies everwhere
No
Fuck sleep.
Night herospirit
Aww
it would be pretty fun
I TRIED to yell it though
I have this kinda thing that's called "insomnia", it conflicts with that "sleep" thing
Sleep is for the weak..
Hence the choking
Night herospirit
Don't mess with the Apple Family.
*yawns*
Aww.
Night herospirit
then began licking the screen?
the brushables are kinda fun
naw
they're a little DIY

Sleep is for those without Caffeene
Lol
After recovering I realized two things
wut D:
I want plushies, nothing else.
fluttersad, because it's awesome
1: It was a horse, not a pony.
although rainbow's brushable is terrible
Cuddled the screen?
the hair is awful
I had 2 large mnt dews, like 32oz, this "sleep" thing just... doesn't seem very attractive to me
bah, I can only sleep when sunlight is beaming down
2,14 DvD/Blu-Rays for me
Best solo ever
Screw Caffeine, I have good stamina!
I want GOOD plushies, and Pins, and shirts
Robotics

Rainbow Dash loves diamonds? That's weird
i wanted to make a reques
in an infinite universe, she is
with the EPIC dash guitar solo
Wow, to be a downer to yourself.

That wouldn't be quite the same
Japan.
*way to
another one
and no, this is normal speed
or... an infinite mutiverse, at least
6,0It would be. . .
if they ever release a derpy brushable
fluttershy, I ADORE CHOCOLte covered espresso beans!!!!!!!1

But if they did, I'd be ecstatic.
it just feels slow compared to the orchestral version I usually watch.
DAMNIT clouds...
Turtaguin: They are the bomb :3
2,14 because we have ponies :P
Meetoo
I regret stacking my stamina

I was thinking "Something with Luna, my favorite" then I'm like "...Luna has about 3 lines in the entire show"
"..." *facehoof*
I am making my own plusshies at the moment XD
pft, wait till s2
I'm more interested in the fandom than the actual show.
6,0Nothing from my lips
srsly
not long
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:07h:00m:45s
I've only been here a day myself
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
:P
I can't wait till the day I see a Pony plushie in one of the Claw Machines. Actually, maybe not, because I'd probably fork out $25 trying to get that thing. >_>
lol
or has it only been a day
Dammit we missed 777777
wait... we missed the 7 7 7 7
Ahh
most people didn't catch on
fail
Haha
>mfw I can't find the tutorials anymore
!mail DerpyBot 1.21 Gigamuffins
ForeverOdin:I would be going to jail for that plushies
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Ali1017
omg
Haha
13I still want the idea of everyone doing a podcast together. But its hard to get even most of everyone together at any given point.
Well welcome to the IRC business
yeah
T.T
news?j

TO EQD
Me neither DSN, that always bugged me.
y thank u
13But could try and work something out.
>streaming tutorials
We have the other PonyIRC
>in the STREAMER section
If you start streaming, I'll give access to it. XD
>can't see any such section
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
which one? I was told that there were two others including us
I want season two to be NOW!
lol, well that's kinda circular :P
imean
excluding
YES!
>you can stream if you read the tutorial
>you can't see the tutorial unless you start streaming
Only one other
Just us and you
Oh my, some one did a pony version Of Nichijou?
how do you do bold?
like this
http://i.imgur.com/AVFSO.jpg
bb
hit the R button
ctrl+b
Turn off bold
buahahahahah
My current avatar is from Hourou Musuko.
Well
then there are settings
You go bold by purchasing it at the stor.
*About to have seziure*
I never use FB anymore. I don't care about these people I never see.
dont do bold
haha yeah
why would they want to
what store?
And the two avatars before that were both from Hourou Musuko.
I want to see some sales figures on the toy line
Well
I emailed him about it and he said he'd re do it next time
heck it took me a 2 months to start using my actual online handle here. I'm not quite ready to embrace them.
Okay
wiener
fine
no fun
Well, I wish you well
oh dear.
If they did
WE would make it
Dumdeedumdeedummm
cool.
They would have to reinstate the show again as soon as they cancel it
OK listen up
Pretty much
When we say don't use bold
then I got hooked
If they canceled the show, the world would end and an interdimensional rift would open, and something like TCB would happen.
That means, "don't use bold".
Getting replaced by Ashton Kutcher, WINNING.
you too
WINNING!
It does not mean "Everyone use bold now!"
I hate FB
I have that much going on in my head right now
Hmm
Thank you.
Okay
I have an idea
applequest!
Okay
O_O
/me knew that was going to happen.
Okay
In the best intrest of IRC's
The animators seem to be worked to the bone. I hope they don't quit.
Wow
Ill pm you
totally.
alright
hope they get a break
Someones angry..
Darn it ponies, Is there nothing you dont go with ?
It's annoying
DannySwish: Ali1017 did, multiple times
Seriously? Stupid KVIrc
I hope they don't kill themselves over it
And it's not just Sketchy_Sounds that is aggrivated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8V_rs6e7E
Val... once we have an APPROVED reason to let you stream, we'll give you access to the streamer section.
I cant see it much on colloquy..
a041744 they dont go with G3.5
http://i.imgur.com/vrTPS.jpg
IE? this is 2011, mate

Agreen, IE is the most unsecured browser

Geez.

Whoo
BEST PONY TIME
Ever since I discovered ponies...
For ipod.
I've been acting weird.
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff this song
Twilight RAGE!!!!!
>suddenly this song became tolerable and even good
Because everyone knows Twilight Sparkle>Twilight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqdaKZW48KU :P
Rarity has done the impossible, she made this song sorta tolerable.
Hopefully we're cool with posting videos now :/
6Requests go in #Vinyl_Scratch
before ponies: wtf is this shit
6Not here
To bawling my eyes out
Sorry no
And now I'm obsessed with Fluttershy.
FluffyWuffs: but... Twilight is an awesome owl...
were still doing request, cool
I hate that song
wat
LOL @ Twilight Poneez
We still doing request?!
13Wait a minute...
6If we are. *shrug*
It has everything I hate about modern society in it
Spin there is an app called my little pony pro
6Either way, no vid links in this room.
Good night
Oh, bye!
I thought Luna just put her computer on a continuous playlist
/me facehoofs atomic7732
Guardians of Ga'Hoole

IT HAS EVERYTHING!
reorganization :P
^That
Luna's AFK or something.
DO WANT
Merci
I don't own an ipod
2,14 yeah, no more requests for tonight
I'm addicted to Depeche Mode atm.
0__0
Good night! Drink Milk!
13I didnt even get the read the guide...
lol
fluttershy is ok but i rather have applejack or rainbow dash
Really?
OR?
lol doesn't matter because you don't need to stream anything?
I'd rather have them ALL!
/me 13sighs
I like all the mane 6, but fluttershy is my second favorite.
lol, rather, yes
13I was thinking about it...
11pm here!
I am off to sleep gentlecolts, see you all tomorrow.
yup
13I have the hardware
0sh
bye!
hey Fireant
well, that's why we just petition for a spot
0ah*
night
4:05 here
I want a Derpy Plush. ^-^
Not for me....
For me
See ya, Allis
in the afternoon
that was a good breakfast
Hi fireant
13I;ve been here a while and I'
if it's approved, we get access. Seems fair to me
Hiya Rynros.
Rarity is the best pony!
Hello minions!
I am getting a derpy plush
Pacific coast FTW.
FluffyWuffs, you misspelled Twilight.
I remember buying my first computer build
13*I've talked about it before, I shouldnt have to partition for it.
MrMooMoo: totally
Spose: Blasphemy
x.x
as in
well, that was unpleasant
Do we have to like... talk about the best pony like 5 times a day?
40k
AMD Athlon 64 3700+ w/ 1 GB RAM and GeForce 6200
Ponies are the best Pony.
6When did you say you wanted to stream?
Yes
6Oo
13Several times.
2,14 oh yes
sigh
13And I had access to it before.
Current order (it changes ALOT) 1.Pinkie Pie 2. Rainbow Dash 3.Fluttershy 4.Twilight 5.Rarity 6.Applejack
we do have to talk about the best pony AT LEAST 5 times a day
BLU PONY
6Everypony had access to it before.
Wat
ON NO, HE HURT LUNA
I'm only talking about the mane 6.
I like, but wat
6Because it was disorganized.
My two favorites are backround characters.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52991
wow, I have a dam good memory
i dont like pinkie pie all that much
Fluttershy is always my first. Second is random but right now it's RD.
I still have Dash and Fluttershy tying for first
okay then... out of all: Imbri and mane 6: Rainbow Dash
13>new mods
Current order: 1:Vinylscratch and Derpy
Every other pony?
They can go awway and form a foreground for those 2
6I literally give access to everypony on an individual basis.
Twilight!!
suddenly communism
The complete history of russia to tetris
I agree completel Lordly
6-_-;
completely*
Very nice. Thank you Derpy.
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
Oh my.
Can't wait for Season 2 :D
6Again, if you have a reason to use it, you'll get access to it.
serfdom, mongol invasion, crappy kingdom, crappier soviet union
Eeeeyup
Russia already ruled the world with a weapon called Tetris
6I just don't feel like changing forum masks for people.
and lines!
13I thought as a mod I was able to look into streaming at any point.
Yes he does
6You are.
*more about Russia, I mean
Believe it or not, the CIA thought that Tetris was a threat to America. They believed it was an advanced military mental training program for their soldiers.
Course Vynl is just awesome.
FUCK, CAFFEINE WHY D YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT AFTER AN AMAZING HIGH
6-_-;
13Oi.
to be fair, the reorganization is kinda needed, especially now that we have a distinction between mods and streamers
13Well, I need a copy of DCD's guide still.
Thats the entire REASON background ponies are awesoemn
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM
roushguy: Switch Twilight and Applejack and you have my list ha
I'm really angry at my brother and roommates right now... >.<
I like Luna because she dealt with crippling lonliness and hate for a thousand years.
Well
Well, in contrast, Furbys were a real threat
twilight/applejack are sorta tied.
:P
furbies...
6Get it?
*shudder*
As are Pinkie Pie/Rainbow Dash
I'm gonna go soon
Ahh gotcha
fair enough
That trombone is good.
My old furby is still in my closet, waiting to kill me in my sleep.
Watching the strem, and trying to catch up with eqd.
My Little Ponies: FiM is a threat to AMERICA!!
staring at each other...
hahaha
you like luna you say/
Ponies are a threat to everything nonpony!
13And you would really think some of us would do that Sprinks?
/me hugs #bronystate
Yeah, it'll encourage our soldiers to be much more friendly
6Not some of you.
eh, it never hurts to play it safe
13Val...
I really wish I could afford to live by myself.
I wamt
/me hugs his toilet bowl
like right now...
/me 13sighs
Dr. Strangelove reference?
this part reminds me of C&C
/me hugs Natelyn back
13Not even going to go there.
Lordlyhour, I am!
Maybe I'll look around an see if there are cheap studio apartments around
lol wth is this?
*Natleyn, I made the same typo AGAIN! D:
13But its fine.

Cuz my roommates are bugging the crap out of me.
lol
:tetris history
It's okay. :3

First paycheck when I get a job I'm buying this shirt http://www.redbubble.com/people/northerndash/t-shirts/7424363-awesomeness-etc?p=t-shirt&utm_campaign=us_tshirts&utm_medium=product_search&utm_source=google_products

6Like I said, I just haven't messed with the masks
but theres only one fic that does a good job with it
13Okay.
Best thing about Russia today: Putin.
That name makes me snicker
Future history...
it didn't catch my interest
!link Raridash
depressing?
That was incredibly interesting.
Shame on you all.
*don't have

thunder_dash *

All off my friends are pony fans like me!
Three
I HATE PEARS
I've been talking about them more and more
http://theartrix.deviantart.com/art/Today-on-Mythbusters-ponies-200939257?q=favby%3Afyre-flye%2F41358073&qo=29
It's still awesome though.
I HATE PAETS
we watched this episode last week I believe
aww
finally, free
NOOOOO
And I've grown hyper-obsessed with Fluttershy
I HATE PEARS
wat
Darn it SME!
DSN GO GO GO
6OH GAWD THIS
Awesome!
fffffffffff
Pega-sis
hmm...this...actually...ME GUSTA
ters
no
See
Thing is
I tried to show them the show, and they watched it. They honestly thought it was dumb, they didn't like the song.
*songs
And they think the characters are stupid.
10 million fulltershys, we..are..fucked...
:O
Samehere mason sort of.
She's quiet, I'm usually kinda loud
Yeah they have
And they just can't get over the fact that it is ponies, always going on about how stupid it is for someone our age to like a show for little girls.
I like this, but the "I would just stand and... Smile" line irks me and I dunno why
Same here ForeverOdin
I like Fireflies... and this song.
http://wtfbot.net/pix/751.png
didn't we already take to Fluttershy about cloning herself?
Well, if one of my friends actually said that to me, I'd tell them that they're not understanding the simple fact that it is an escape. Like gaming and reading. An escape into innocence.
TrollightSparkle: I wouldn't expect any less >_<
:)
Yeah sockwear
I want to go to some meetups.
not soon enough
*to
ANYWAY, for great justice
meetups are awesome
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
Is there any meaning to the Pillow on the head or am I just being stupid?
MrMooMoo, http://bronies.com
screw the haters
^ the best plan
6,0Testing the music stream would be wonderful, if we could have a try at it
9 AM PST?
2,14 Awwwwwww RAWRity....join us!
I'm getting up. >w>
Whats the name of that song?
2,14 EST
9am EST
this channel should have
Oh damn
That's 6 PST
My friends probably wouldn't like it because they fear losing their "man card"
ForeverOdin, you could start one
2,14 RIGHT ON Thunder_Dash!
We talking about tomorrow or when Season 2 premiers?
Jam toll thingies
Season two
roll**
Sockwear_Moon, that doesn't mean they won't like it, it just means they'll be conflicted about liking it
niiiiiiiiice
Sockwear_Moon, just like all of us were :P
Pinkie has hands
Ok
Odds of me finding enough of them for a meetup are slim to none...
/me brohooves everypony
I've actually thought about it, But I'm not too good with those types of things. Maybe sometime though.
but hey, that works too :P
*brohoof*
Ponies with hands just look wrong
That Pinkie is a lie!
Night, ponies.
Wait 6 AM or PM?
Its an alternate reality
Seriously
Well, yeah. But it would be difficult to get them to watch it in the first place. I know I was on the fence with the pilot episode, but I warmed up to it by the end.
2,14 6 PM is the re-showing
2,14 9 AM is the premiere
6am pst on the 17th
neat
13Did we confirm there is a re-showing?
Damn, okay

it's been bugging me all day long.. and it happened yesterday
Start>Shut down> wait> turn back on
well when i said never leaves i mean it's burnt into my brain for the time being.. since i don't want it there it naturally stays for a long long time.. like a song
a terrible song that you would like to punch if it had physical form
tehe
I seem to have a lot of luck with that.
Awesome.

Or in val case ask Dari how to do it.
2,14 where would the fun be in that? :P
meh, Dari's afk
yeah you would probably have to ask Dari how
2,14 also, I'll have you know that I only needed his help with initial colors, I figured out backgrounds on my own tyvm :P

my college doesn't have the hub channel
convenient
9well you've been fed nothing but lies. 1080p is a resolution.
9it might try to emulate it
ok
9not to mention we're not a commercial business
doesn't change the difference in quality though
9businesses can do that
It might be 1080p if you maximize it...
9we can't
uh
people stream from their basements
9okay buster
i'll link you something hang on

Not getting any sound
hey that ep was on thismorning.
May is the climatological peak of tornado season.
Beeping here
I hear it too.
DCD's alarm is going off.
No beeping, just... no sound
Or a bomb.
/me 11mutes it and goes back to work.
The beeping is getting faster.
And that beeping is speeding up.
it's the tab-overload alarm
damn it. Well killed the audio
maybe really low beeping?
Oh a hat, how quaint.
/me explodes
I wish I could brush Rarity's hair for her... oh wait, I can.
It appears ... really jerky for me
*brushie brushie*
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-percent-harder-in-ten-seconds-flat.jpg
OK GOOD
Decapman, xxheadremoverxx
i can't even load the stream
My connection can handle 720p fine, but the stream's still jerky
and some other things
Oh I totally get it
9it's just too much of a load divided by little time
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-me-too-pega-sister2.jpg
9the load total skyrockets
Well, to be fair to MantisToboggan, the stream he linked to works perfectly fine in 720p for me.
1/(.5) = 1/(1/2) = 1*2 = 2.
but I agree that that's not a very wise setting, or you wouldn't get half the viewers
4O.O
4I read that differently...
Huh?
wat
?
13lmao
9do you post in ponychan
I am sure with corporate sponsors we could totally have that kind of stream too.
only once
Is the stream up?
I post5 on Ponichan ALL THE TIIIIIME
I hate chans.
I avoid them.
4chan just gives any chan a bad name.
*waiting for broadcast*
I GOT AWAY!YAY!
http://www.twitch.tv/steven_bonnell_ii
I know that ponychan has restrictions, but it seems to harbor problems in itself.
wat, SC2?
I'd rather watch ponies than SC2, though :P
Not a misspelling
9hmm
Yeah he... ugh... he's a traitor
Never heard of him...
2,14 please be patient everyone, we're working on a solution
9Twitch.tv
9never had heard of them
He was an asshole to everypony anyway
No, not Mustaine. MUSTANG
Also, he's the lead singer of Megadeth.
9I'll look into it
seems like Twitch.tv is for gaming only
same here, never heard of the name
Same.
9yeah
9exactly
9Twitch.tv must have
9some propietary software
no his full name is "Dave Mustang the Cynical Brony"
9not to mention their streaming software (justin.tv) is EXPENSIVE AS FUCK
9as in
Look at posts on Equestria Daily from July
9 999 dollars a month
look @ the comments
9for those packages
Ohwow, that's really expensive shit.
Hi guys! one more week!
Wait, why isn't the stream on?
EEEEYUP
Like I said we could totally stream like that with corporate funding =p
THE FUCK?
damn, thats fucked up
yup
Wait, he said that
Hmm.
No wait he's that commenter.

HEY LUNA!I DARE YOU TO DRINK THE POTION!

9Mantis, Mantis, Mantis
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
9you don't know shit about streaming, do you?
not really
Call on the sea ponies~
i know that a ton of people i know stream
I dont know, these sea ponies are ok: http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/168/b/c/my_little_seaponies_by_aleximusprime-d3j7fv2.png
9allow me to show you, then.
out of their apartment on their computers
without making excuses for having poor quality
sorry guys, the stream is offline?
http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9896347.jpg
9* Starter $99 /month
9Standard $499 /month*
huh, since when
I managed to stream on my ipod with the free justin.tv app
and Enterprise: 999 per month
that's uStream
Justin.tv charges for their streaming software, dynno and Wirecast
that said
I chased with a couple of streamers this year.
there is a vital reason we're not using justin.tv or uStream as our main streams
It might look good little, but when you maximize it...llooks like crap
hate justin.tv, its way too laggy for me for some reason
Oh, you have to pay to get above 240p?
05in other words, Hi everypony
also keep in mind Sathi and Sprinks are still learning my quality optimization techniques
http://www.justin.tv/p/pro_faq
pretty much
i really don't know where you get these numbers from
/me 13is reminded of the Halloween event on WoW from Wreks message
since everyone where i look and everonye i ask is streaming for free
i'm at a loss, really
Hummm I'm sure I saw a decent free multi stream program the otherday.
that said
wait a second, Mantis
...Once my computer finishes rebooting
http://mthruf.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/job-fails-tread-carefully.jpg
ok
oh okay
and i'm asking people right now and everyone is saying its free
as I said
Mantis*
i'm not upset
i asked about it earlier and i got a load of excuses that noone makes in any other scene
that don't seem to hold up
competitive gaming scene has been doing streaming longer than anyone, back before mogulus came out with the first easy service anyone can set up
6Mantis, we've already stated that we're working on the quality. Frankly, the quality you're watching right now is the emergency backup.
ok that's all i really wanted anyway
2,14 lol, the emergency backup of the emergency backup TO the emergency backup :P
6Pretty much, Val.

9okay
9Mantis
9get in here
k
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BurningRed
9and fullscreen that shit
Why kill the pimp?
Also, Elvis hallucination is Val Kilmer iirc.
that stream...is glorious
9this is not even the maximum quality we can do
9however, in SD because he doesn't have Hub HD
9however, you see, there are many factors in streaming
9input size, output size, bandwidth on both viewer and streamer, and computer power on both as well
yeah i'm aware of this
9my streamers are still learning
but all i know is that other's do it on regular basis with no drama, which was why i asked :P
teach us wise one
9oh, and this quality is not attainable with other stream providers
9now maximise
:O
05Flutteryay do not tempt me :o
do not want

Have to alter a few lines, though.
9are you satisfied, then, Mantis?
Because we ended up with a female playing a male part
Yes it is. He's a complete wigger in this movie.
And fewer guys go for plays than girls
yes, since all i ever wanted was a "working on it"
Okay, then that's solved...
Is the stream supposed to be on? It isn't for me :0

You'll have plenty of time to post it...
The bidding actually went down on the Rainbow Dash mascot suit http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337#ht_1110wt_1270
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
/me waits for someone else to finish that thought
:3c
Any Germans in here?
Hey, I saw that costume on a couple of forms before, its a shame I cant afford it
Caused me to stop drinking
too bad lauren's sketches weren't costumes
OMG THE POWER IS BACK ON!
/me dances
How does he know that its real....
and also posting moon srivia
07hello*
07omg
If I have over 2.5 G to bid on that suit then I would do it
YOU NEED HELP LUNA?!
Forgive me if thre are reference numbers in my trivia
Psh, you weren't rude :P Hey there
07yea please do
Lee Donnowitz is supposed to be descended from Donny Donnowitz from Inglourious Basterds.
Fun Fact.
:P
13I'm guessing the people bidding on it arent familiar with suit commissioners and such lol
13And poor Luna. :(
I'm just surprised that the bid went down
And
I don't even make $2.5k a month.
mfw half of the people here have no idea about this
/me hugs Luna
13Someone retracted their bid must be or something
Nor have that in the bank.
it must be a coincidence
http://sharetv.org/images/back_to_the_future/dr_emmett_brown-char.jpg
Yeah that must be it. The suit was yesterday up at 3600 and 18 bids
Yes there was, I liked it :3
For srs?
Nothing bad ever really happened to it
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337
A halloween costume?
Oh sheeeeeeeeet
That costume has wing boners
THAT costume
13Not a halloween costume
13lol
You can wear it in Halloween
That was my reaction when I first saw it
Best Halloween costume ever!
13You could. lol
>_<
13But its not specifically for Halloween
But it's a bit... furry
Imagine seeing that riding a roller coaster
I just need to figure out how to make one of those costumes...
same here, maybe I should find some one that actually makes them
If I was rich, that would be in my closet right now
Or on me...
Dat early response?
Thats only the first movie and a bit of the second movie
lol
I'm a bit weird according to some since I like ponies and whatnot, but I don't think I'd wear that suit.
07hope you get it sorted out before RHPS
Yo
Should I continue with the time machines flaws?
It's just today
wiat, whats RHPS?
I magical opera
I'm working on a design for a time machine.

I was only there for the after show stream

And because Sizemore was supposed to be in this movie
why is stream down?
LIKE A BOSS
Luna: The music just got really weird and some bad remixes of Pony songs played
07nice Bjorn
07weird?
07it's not even my list ;)
07it's just a list with over 200 vids
Luna: Okay then, the list had some bad remixes near the end
Beginning was good, but the end was just rape on the ears
07i'm sorry
07I can't edit it
07but if you suggestions we do have our own playlist too
Luna: It's cool, thanks for playing it all night though
I lol'd at driven by Biff.

Cop: I can hear you yelling you know

Which cut of Blade Runner
Beautiful!
Problem, officer?
It's Pinkie Pie sugar!
hello all
The pure cut?
Oxymoron?
And I applaud you for it
I got some pizza :D
More moon trivia!
No officer it was hers, she threw at me to frame me
/me has an idea for an End of Winter celebration
We should do a three-day showing fo the Toy Story Trilogy.
allisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only about a third of its mass.
Hey Jayne_Cobb
You mean Callisto, right?

Fluttershy: Lunar republic…? IS THAT FROM SEASON 2!?! :O
the cops are just cops that somehow know about this cocaine
nope.avi
/me highhooves Fluttershy
They interrogated Elliot after he got busted. He told them the bs story Clarence told him.
how long's this movie been going?
A while
This is near the end
This show could only be more star-studded if it was Twilight's flank.
about 10-15 more minutes left
Yeah, what's up with this music?
The music makes sense at the end, kinda.
their music department had a low budget?
Fluttershy: You know, the second year that you are friends with the Mane 6
I still don't understand this scene
Clarence knows somethings wrong, but he's a little too trusting of Elliot.
I don't get it...
he lied.
Bong time
Fluttershy: The Lunar Republic?
Douche!
Clarence just happened.
Reminds me of my neighbour lol
Lunar Republic is best republic.
Heres a picture of Callisto http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Callisto.jpg
Callisto looks like a moon...

"One of 'em just put a gun to my face, we're real good friends."
http://tinyurl.com/3ojttu5
he surface of Callisto is heavily cratered and extremely old. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts.
Can we have toast and squirt guns as well?
05"two bodybags"
hehehehe
the legendary viewings with the disguised people
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZgfCblZDWk

Rarity: Why would you record yourself laughing for 10 minutes?!
she's very vain?
that noise
10 minutes huh...If I can survive a hour of Nyan I can survive that vid!
Rarity: Now you just trollin' -__-
Oh I see why now...

This film has been brought to you by the letter F.
Shits about to get REAL.
HERE COMES THE GOOD PART!
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL
I missed the beginning
Toilet elvis
The word of the day is Fuck kids
He's Elvis, he's Clarence's spiritual guide. (Clarence is a little crazy)
Well if you hate fucking cops, then just don't fuck 'em. Seems easy enough.
It's like watching a Fuck-Shit stack on top of itself
ALWAYS bet on Clarence.
I dunno, maybe
-clarence's drug trip-
Are we all really useful engines?
Officer DIMES!
Wise words from Elvis
Is Elliot really that stupid?
Yes
Yes he is.
Everyone dies. the end.
I can't believe those cops go in there without any bullet proof vests...
elliot killed them all.
JUST LIKE A SHAKESPEREAN DRAMA
I can't believe it's not butter
NO NOT CLARENCE!!
05...And then they all walked the dinosaur.
Is this the part where we throw rice at the screen?
And bullets
Cops win.
I didn't see Clarence get shot.
Its only a flesh wound
Dat italian.
*continues walking even though shot*
[/hipster]
Hey I got shot..what am I suppose to do if that happens...oh now I remember! URK!!
05hm?

Callisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of approximately 1 880 000 km (26.3 times the 71 492 km radius of Jupiter itself).

Then ponies
and delishuz RHPS
Dat Tarentino Monologue
>this part is stupid
Okay, PONY TIME
Imagine the entire pony episode in 3D.
>this part is awesome
Whoa
It needs to be 20% more cooler
lol elvis
I'd like to watch pony ep 3D
Even through I'm against 3D movies
ponies in 3d would basically be the same as 2d
I just killed my eyes watching that clip
given that they are 2d creatures
05The rigging and anitmation needs to be solid. even slightly off and id prefer 2D
:D
05animation*
Scatr: BUT IN 3D
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S5aBzSBegoo/Tmu49tRdR3I/AAAAAAAAL4o/5tvlsrtrhOU/s1600/h1zC.jpg
Threeeeee-Deeeeee
I'm kinda pissed that I missed the first half of this movie
lol
Now it's really awkward when Clarence says "Elvis told me to kill a pimp."
I prefer 2D animation too.
I have a feeling that someone is going to do a chocolate rain skit with that episode
3D is significantly easier though- thats why there's more 3D cartoons out there.
Of course 2D is still the way to go, but for the novelty's sake I'd like to see one entire episode in 3D
3DS 3D
05depends on the shader scatr
I want to get OoT on DS
For ponies I'd do it
Ocarina of time was my all time favourite :D
Pffffft, This needs no glasses.
It is? I'M GETTING IT :D
wtb virtual reality ponies actually
lol luna
i know that feel
It could be a delay luna

The first 11 engines
So...how does the 3D work?
Magnets
3D is a trick of the eyes
This is Pinkie Pie's favorite show
I'm getting a 3DS when my old DS lite breaks
friendly magnets
Luna lol, this has happened to trixie before
Naw, 3D usually works through polarized light.
13 3D'S! How do they work?!
afraid i don't really see it espy :<
colours are good obv
Which is soo,the top screen keeps turning off
the 3DS is weirdly awesome
How long till Pony episode starts?
I want a 3Ds
who's streaming?
Luna is I believe Combustiblelen
scatr: If you want to believe that
its all going on the same stream channel right?
No scatr, you're thinking of the Virtual Boy
lol
3DS reports are mostly of headaches.
anyone who's ever tried one can confirm this
I'll keep my old DS then I think :P
Dat cone
I hate it when games consoles go down in price
3DS is great, though.
like 1 week after you brought it
the picture I linked? Look at it crosseyed until you see extra versions of the two parts in the middle, then focus on the single middle image.
that shit's hard even when you can write at a decent rate
okay, you're one of the exceptions, then. I couldn't play for a minute without my eyes tearing up.
We are watching a traffic cone
/me is watching a traffic cone
I very rarely get headaches
^
centigrade: nothing atm, ponies next, then TIMEWARP
(rocky horror)
3DS is fine, though, just don't overdo the 3D slider
07Let's do the timewarp againnnn
great
now that song is stuck in my head
^
3DS isn't painful at all
07rocky horror is amazing
I'm not even sure how it's a horror movie...
they're overrated if you ask me
It was fun to watch though
I don't plan on getting a 3DS. I'm sticking with my DS Lite and it's GBA slot thanyouverymuch.jpg
Lucky_Charms, if you don't have eyes then you don't get to see Ponies
Disregarding the mind rape
lawl
FABULOUS HAT
3DS isn't, unless you've got the 3D slider set too high
GBA slot is genious.
oh look, ponies!
Goodbye.
Whuh? How is 3DS epic fail?

Pony time!
*squee*
13She saw my hat and said it was absolutely hat!
this episode is one of the best, mostly because of photo finish
Been idle for a long time because schoolwork, but re: 3DS - the problem I have with it is that often (for me at least) is that I stop noticing the 3D unless it starts doing strange things
05*SQUEE*
Oh look the 3Ds just grew a tumor
Dat please
THE USUAL!
Rarity = best customer ever
It's only 'cause they're adding another analog anyway...
Sega CD?
At least three
Wait, why a third movement control?
Well.... that sucks
Masochspike!
they also had the ingenious idea of connecting cartridges XD
Lets see, the Sega CD, 32X...those are the ones I remember from the top of my head
Sega CD, Sega 32X (or whatever it was called) and an adapter for SMS systems IIRC
I don't get it either, doesn't the touch screen work just fine?
Why does Fluttershy look like a burlesque dancer
Fluttershy hates spike
I still have a GameGear...

awesome.
360, PS3, ect: two analogs, dpad
Combustiblelen: No, she loves Baby Dragons :P
05yfw i dont own any kidn of console
But the DS has a touch screen that functions as a second analog.
she got to know spike, now she hates him.
OMG
consoles are srs bsns
GUYS*
Foreeeeevarrrr
*gasp*
And thus a meme was born
FOTO FEENEESH
Anyone else nostalgic for the GBA?
I never would've expected that
<3 Photo Finish
Oh hi Rainbow Dash
Now
photo finish is underrated D:
No!
YES!
05mhyees
NO!
YES!
I keep forgetting to buy batteries for mine D:
ENOUGH
Photo Finish should show up in season 2, at least her theme song should.
more ponies with euroaccents are required for season 2
I do too, I can't remember where I put it though
just need to plug it in to charge it, ooh yeah
We Go!
Lost my charger for my SP D:
I still have my SP, but the battery only last about a hour and thirty minutes
I GO
Ow ow ow ow
I'd say it's worth it.
I haven't charged my SP in years and it still turns on. <3
Whenever I see Photo Finish, I can't NOT see her as a disguised Rainbow Dash
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48918?search=rainbow_dash%20photo_finish Thanks to this comic
05natöre
Oh wow, that comic is awesome
I need to buy FF6 for GBA though...
where's the movie?
alternatively, photo finish is disguising as rainbow dash most of the time
lawl
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/56275 :<
LOL at the comic
That comic has fucked my mind. You NEVER see Photo Finish and Rainbow Dash in the same place! Think about it.
Wunderbar!
And RD herself shows up all of, like, once
where's the stream?

Maybe I'll go and buy one today.

It also tied up all the weird crap in MGS2
Screw math!
Ohey there's going to be MGS HD collection
I haven't finished MGS4.
Even if it kills me...
And finally I get to play Peacewalker
GOOD LUCK DUMB SHIT
Can't play MGS4 for one sole reason...no PS3
I'm not stuck. Just haven't picked it back up.
Can't really play it on a CRT TV because I can't read the text.
The end of part 4 of MGS4 is epic.
*Darf

I'm on Act 2.

Act 4 is my favourite act.
Act 3 is my least favourite.
No spoilers.
Spoilers in MGS are fatal to gameplay.
I won't spoil it for you :P
is there a low-quality option on the veemi.com stream?
Like spoilers killed KOTOR for me.

I still need to play MGS4

AppleJack has got to lay off the AppleJack *punched*
Got it's wikipedia page open on nother tab and everything
In a December 2003 report, NASA expressed belief that an attempt for a manned mission to Callisto may be possible in the 2040s
NASA can't get the money to get back to the moon.
lazy twilight unnecessarily teleports.
agreed darf
*mankind
Of course,living on Callisto would be harder than living at the south pole
Humanity wants to bitch over resources on Earth to have them in the here and now.
And the US govt can't get along to fix the economy.
MOON TOURISM.
>resource problems over.
I really want to visit L2
Convince humanity that.
but... wouldn't rainbow be launched *into& the tower
Anyway,that's Callisto triviafied

...why do you know these things?
@Bjorn, I mean
guessing you work with horses bjorn
^ LOL
horses regularly unsheath their penises to "ventilate" them
Mule: "Biding our time for the revolution."
2,14 and we're done with that subject
Applejack: Pick up that can.
you have to clean a horse's sheath at least once a month
Run from bunnies?

Time is a part of the measuring system used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change such as the motions of objects.
i still don't get where the time warp actually cam in, but then i barely followed the plot at all

On the net 3 weeks is old, a year is ancient
Do we have PMVs of EVERY SONG IN RHPS?

I agree
Dash is best pony.
Deal with it.
