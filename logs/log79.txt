I would but it's too much hassle.
Bye
You type their name.
And I has to sleep
Oh wow. That simple huh? Thanks!
do it anyway
Yep, that simple. you're welcome.
it's called highlighting, keeps you from missing when someone addresses you in busy channels.
Considering that was my first time drawing such a lanky critter I don't think I did too badly.
NRGFORCE inspired me to play WWU on piano :D
If I could work out or find the chords for it I'd totally take a crack at WWU on guitar.
You guys still watching Gurren Lagann (sp?)?
there oughta be something for it at everyponysings
No idea how good these are, but here: http://www.everyponysings.com/2010/05/winter-wrap-up-tabs.html
they have the tabs for WWU at ultimate-guitar.com
Ooh
seriously? that's awesome
back
Oh actually the chords seem quite straightforward
is it 133211 or the other one?
which is, uh... xx3211?
bah, tuning
Or alternatively xx3211
Bah my winter wrap up chords I submited on Everyponysings is 20% cooler than the reset!

Fall as in, the first word I thought of when I looked down at the keyboard and saw the letter 2F"

That just makes me d'awwww
Xiagu has worked pretty well for me too :D
It sounded nice.

lol
i didn't listen to much music when i was younger
was sad that anthology wasn't well received...they didn't know most of the songs from it
did make me sad pony :P
Why don't you just show them an episode?
:P
well, that much I couldn't convince them unfortunately
yet >: D
The anthology is as long as an episode. O_o
IT'S DONE
yeah
wasn't length related, they just didn't want to see an episode
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Tah-daaah~!

this is WAY more awesome than that.

:P
I hear Dari munching on noms :P
Pasta.
And thus, the cbox has died once again
by MY hand!
the text turns blue
well, something more...noticeable than that
Get a proper client.
:P
O_o
It's noticeable enough on mIRC.
never actually used it unfortunately
He's definitely giving Celestia a run for her money in lankiness.
It'll work in any IRC client.
owait.
It'll still work.
Just won't show colours.
yeah I know, but then it'll be boring
mIRC is best client anyway.
I'll have to look into it at some point
It means that the mod has set mute mode

Hello again
/me spams RANEBOE DASH AWLWAIZ DRESUZ IN STYUL, much to RBD's expense

oh
MAKE IT CANON
There was one episode in which 4 of the characters had their personalities mixed around
MAKE IT CANON
Oohhhhh
13Oh I finished my food already
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaLGS8_gE7g
Yeah i'll kill that rotten piece of cadaver vomit
/me shrugs, sips assam tea.
steven/sweetie = hot skitty on wailord action
It was about them being someone else, sorta
13Now I feel like eating fig rolls, but SOMEONE ate them .w.
12LOL!
LOL
I'd be interested in seeing Sea Ponies G4'd.
/me wipes off mouth, then whistles
http://youtu.be/0XgKmyTg0Qc
GGgala, at least with Skitty and Wailord, they could have fertile offspring
Imagine if Fluttershy ended up with Pinkie Pie's personality
I imagine her face when: "Sweetie Derelle"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
..
no
yeeeh she's starting to be become a tiny bit too assertive to be called FlutterShy anymore
YES!
Pinkie Shy
But that's not the weirdest couple involving Wailord
Ninja-d
lol
Fluttermina Diane...Cake
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSR76VHhII
yeah, that was the first episode
And Rainbow Dash and Applejack are voiced by the same person also.
13Well that was fun
No.
more about a personality merge
06xD
13and she said he was lying
hi barry
13D:
Optimus Pie
http://youtu.be/5zLJqaUDN_E
APPLEJACK.
Applejack or Rainbow Dash?
We're just having some fun
06i would do the s- erm..
06xD
Snips or Snails.
Applejack...oh, Rarity working on a farm.
Applejack
:D
12Blame them both
mainly because shes awesome
13It's ok though, I have seal bars instead
13Like penguin bars, but cheaper
i say Twilight
I live 'em all
que esta haciendo Dari?
and
Chikunnism
i want Pinkie with Twilights personality
No pony is the BEST.
Objection!
Rainbow Dash as Fluttershy?
Luna is the best!
In which 4 ponies had their personalities change
13Oh, let me correct that
06they have a aldi in the UK?
13They're like penguin bars, but cheaper and don't have a joke on the back
and there was a song about how great it was to be somebody else
06i though it was only in germany and the netherlands
oh dari did you say that software was called 'v8 screen capture' earlier? i think i misheard
Which one?
VH
HA.
13Nope, Aldi is here too :P
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
VH?
12What no joke?
The VH was at GGgala.
13I know right :<
inb4 moonbase spam
MOONBASE!
And Pinkie Sparkle's hair would inexplicably curl into a puff. Holla holla get dolla.
Pinkie Pie
PINKIEEEEE
and the brain
Wasn't Fluttershy going to though?
thats boring
Fluttershy needs Spikes personality
I mean, Pinkie's got some unexplainable influence over the fabric of reality, right? If she became a unicorn... I fear for Equestria.
Oh thanks. :P
I've never played it before.
FullerDashPie SparklingRariti Jack
Great idea
to be fair, I'd laugh WHILE giving you advice :P

It's all the intros.
From 1963-2010.
:P
I've got it!
You know how Pinkie Pie often sings?
Not as often as I'd like.

If an episode is made in season 2 in which the characters get a personality shuffle...
Enough to keep me awake at night

Rainbow Dash already has pinkie's personality
aka her own goofy personality
Here we go
I don't think he can act at all.
Transformers ROTF has the best action scene ever
Are we talking Tara Strong acting like Pinkie Pie?
/me attemps to deathbomb
Do want.
And he's the most fugly person I've ever seen.

Rum of the Forbidden?
I mentioned the idea of the characters of G4 having their personalities mix around
Because of a G1 episoder
episode*
twilight get's pinkies, twilight to applejack, applejack to fluttershy, fluttershy to Pinkie
/me read that as "G1 spider"
dat intro
well due to season 1 had pretty much a lot of clicheic storylines
>Newest intro
and Spike
>_>
oh right
<_<
i don't see why not ;)
rarity cant fly
RARITY CANT FLY
Rarity with Spike's personality
Rainbow Dash: Why am I dressing in style?
WELL APPLEJACK DOESNT HAVE A HORN
02D:
....
the retun if Narcisus
/me is hyper .-.
ELT
that would break the line
Cuz RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN ST*punched*
/me runs
Hmm... *taps chin* ...Nah.
can you eat that?
bowties are cool
I think Rarity with Applejack's personality is funnier
They weren't cool before.
Now they're the most uncool thing in existence.
:P
lawl
I still stand for Rarity with Spike's personality
RAAAGE!
fezes are cool
seeing Rarity as a texan rofl..
I don't think the voices would change
03yeah
They would just act differently
DAMN YOU OSAP ELIGIBILITY!
now do we
omg spoilers
I do! :)
RARITY'S!
02alllsoo
lol
HOW ABOUT HE ISNT INCLUDED

03Angel_Espeon, kill it
13I feel bad killing the smaller ones though .w.
xD
03I don't
is it normal that i'm whistling winter wrap up?
suddenly becoming obsessed with books
well all i know is that TWILIGHT NEEDS PINKIE'S
02Since I suck atm
7I'm not on my desktop. XD
13and the spider's vanished now, dunno where it went :<
exactly
7Try in one hour?
lol
ouch
rainbow
03that's why you kill them when you see thoem LOL
and then you'd explode again?
03*them
Totally
thats the idea
That would be weird
13I'll probably see it again in about a week's time, and it'll be a huge thing with long legs
7Spiders are helpful. D:
13and just thinking about that made me shiver x_x

02sorry Xelispeon
02waay to used to CS 1.6 :P
He's doing some minnor hitting on her this season
I get the feeling Rarity would shoot him down sadly
06I'm kidding ~
Can Twilight use magic to turn Spike into a pony? *shot*
Woo
Here comes Tennant.
I ment actually ask her out type hitting on her
13!espeon
he did
7Well, TF2's gameplay is different.
but offscreen
remember
...
Oh YEAH
02I noticed\
7Did you try offline practice?
03CounterStrike is actually somewhat worth playing
it was off-screen
03but ew highly addicting substances/games
06o.o
02of course Quan :P
7Okay.
yeah
06LOL yeah okay Counter Strike isn't addictive to some people as well, that's a good one
She turned down those handlebars? Man. Rarity's a shrewd negotiator.
how couuuuld you?
03some people get addicted to anything
02^
06Of course
03but I haven't seen nearly as many people being addicted to it than TF2
I DONT WANT TO GO
7Placebos, a webcomic demonstrates.
02Me included, lol
>meta
/me is addicted to Espeon
lame last words though
/me runs

7But lol, DRF, nah.
Ironic that Tennant chose to leave.
06guys n' girls
>last words
06leaving for italy now
I don't want to go.
03Quanyails, you can claim you aren't addicted all you want, but I think the playtimes speak for themselves. :P
NOPNY's GONNA EVER KEEP ME DOWN!
06So yes, it is addictive
Look at that ugly thing.
13Have fun Cloudey! :3

02seeya ~
WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
13THE SPIDER
Maybe someone could write a fanfic in which the characters of G4 get a personality shuffle?
13it went under the desk
13and I lost it again
XD
06She reached the amount of hours played I had in 3 months in like... 2 weeks LOL
umad dari? :P
13;w;
Very.
03it doesn't count it as playtime if you aren't playing o.o
I totally would
7Exactly.
INB4 I instaban you. :P
haha
03I do that and I basically get stuck with dialup speeds
hey, not that it isn't a bad thing, but how long has this Personality switch convo been going on? XD
filler till season two
03^
02lol
crap
03I prefer computer games that are standalone
02Hey angel. speaking of games...
03and can be played without needing a third-party DRM check
02Re-download TH9\
02xD
13I was expecting that LOL
/me decides to work on his drawing for today... would like to finish the second part
13yeah
13|D
02when are you motivated then? xDDD
03as criminals can just disable them LOL
03it's like that one WIN! picture I saw
13LOL
Ô.o
03as that's about all
03er
Never understood that
03that's about all anti-theft is actually good for
It's an animating program.
i know
but
Frames, tweening, etc.
Lots of hard work.
you have a bunch of frames and you have objects that you move around between frames
I need some sad music now.
oh oh I know
It's the truth, sadly
/me watches Unsolved Mysteries
03Yep
03how is it sad though?
have you played FFX?
IDK

awww
03locks only keep the honest people outl.
03-l
LOL
XD
03same with passwords on computers, etc
nice
oh celestia no
sexytime
*spews random objects in all directions*
kk...
03don't give people a reason to break in
I see a still image of twilight
Still?
meh, I still prefer to have passcodes for certain things
Oh no.
Pinkie Pie finds The Mask
;)
no
Lycan? as in "Lycanthrope"?
computers, I don't have much valuable data to have stolen
Best.Crossover.EVER!
hmm
03just don't let people use things that are important to you.
As in.
the stream isn't working for me then
the Mask would make her look normal in comparison
and it's not an easy thing to steal
at least my computer
interesting
Exactly!
03and no need to have a password :P
I'm usually pretty good with that
03plus even if you do, you can just get a password cracker
It probably is.
03not YOU per se, but someone
You just haven't noticed she's moving.
closer
some
and closer
03well
Dem eyes
03some people just steal laptops to sell them
03you're never seeing that data again anyway
at the same time that is
Pinkie Pie In Coco Bongo!
But Lycan or Ly is fine.
Now I see it, it's very slow
I could watch this all day.
03yeah, the average person would just sell it to someone :P
It makes it inconvenient for them
the stream's twilight is the same, whereas the sidebar is actually zooming
03not at all
Like most Italians here
The eyes
there it goes
I don't put a passcode on my computer, though
PULSING EYES
oh noes
BRB
wait a second
wait
let's call 'im crai
I guess I should say, a passcode is an anti-data theft thing, not an anti-theft thing
03exactly
damn
03they do it to make money
i cant find the clip
it just provides a simple way to keep people from immediately getting into it
here it is:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
more of a simple protective measure or a delay than a full on encryption thing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
Coco Bongo > NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But it's also a slight deterance
'Sup J?

I left my phone on my bus one day by accident, and somebody probably got into my backpack when I wasn't looking and stole my graphing calculator
At a hay bar?
which the school let me borrow
It is a piece of satire.
Hi/
03LOL
Lol
/me or werebrony if one would prefer. >_>
03oh yeah, I lost a calculator once too
"Just say no to abstinence!"
and then they forced me to pay them back with another one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
03every time you turn it on, it says that it's my property, and to please call me if it's found
/me loves the 3rd person.
xD
03so if someone steals it they'll get really annoyed with that stupid message XD
03the only way to get rid of that is to know how to use the Start-Up program
or maybe they'll be nice and return it
03and most random idiots won't
03exactly.
03it's worth a try, right?
which they haven't
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Yup
03well I haven't had that calculator stolen :P

03XD

GMT is always UTC+0..
....It's like they took three things from my childhood and mashed them together in the most epic win way possible.
however, i liked the 2001 reference in Season 1
13I don't know the difference LOL
but if the intended zone was BST, then..
It's of not matter.
Minnet: what's the time BST?
Ok
13!espeon
Hmm, I never really saw that as the monolith.
Oh yeah, Italy is GMT+2
yes
I thought it was +1
the camera angle was exactly the same
I suppose it might have been, yeah
as in 2001
Italy currently observes CEST, which is UTC+2, yes
I was wondering there was a specific code for that or something.
Minnet: what's the time utc+2?
that's correct
Oh snap, I forgot!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZnntFenRk
Yea
I know, Norway's got CEST too.
CET in wintertime.
Well... okay, yeah, all of them

Tab is the reason I sometimes kick/ban the wrong people.
06I have to go like, now sadly.
TABFAILS
or at least convenient, like microwaves.
Y U
Yes, they did try to keep it kid-friendly
7Okay, Espy.
Wut?
rather than separately next to the thtle have a URL
Dman is that even possible with IRC?
geddit
7Well, if the meeting passes, I'll be playing.
Lawl.

oh
le aww...
13D:
02Same .-.

Mmm, copypasta.
13DDD:
7if my stream goes well I might stream more frequently
hmmm?
12I'm glad you found it
02NS is missing... again =\
WTF is Gozer?
12 4chan, just like everything else
GhostBusters

06So yeah, good nigh -.-

Otherwise, not much
Anyway, everyone want to start now before you guys have to go?
Dman / Dealerwealer
D: Xeli
I think
Sure
name
natta Espeon
06I have no choice sadly
06:)
Seeya then
Anyway
name is 'Dario Montes Rodriguez'
Lol Sathi
7had honestly no idea
04o-o
Not lately
but now i use it a LOT more than dealerwealer aniways
7why that name? :)
04Yeah
04not for long though
7just curious
Because D is the 4th letter from A and W is the 4th letter from Z
The one about TST's stagnancy
WTF IS GOING ON IN HERE
That's why :P
I did read that, yes
I THOUGHT I CLEANSED THIS ROOM
(true story) (thought of this when I was like 8, and used dealerwealer ever since)
I hate it when people PM me with stupid questions
Because Del Boy?
:P
04Yes
Interesting.
Do you agree or disagree, and why?
Yyay
7nicely found
oh man...what I wouldn't give to see Deus Ex streamed here one week
Fund it
hold on
okies
The only name I thought of when I was a child around that age that has stuck around is Severus Mortego Orchivald IV.
Is that a film Val?
06Well I guess I'll add my look on it even though I don't have that much time.
Oh.
04But then, TST has nearly always been like this from my experience.
I have none
...
there's a particular meme associated with it, lemme find it
how do I find a website?
seems like we are talking about everything exept ponies
7put on some music or ponyvid
7dari
ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH
It has, and there has always been an inner circle
a vidya. a form of electronic entertainment. interactive movie. book with vision. movie which reacts to ya. etc XD
04how i mine 4 fish?!1?
here it is:
And Xeli, that's exactly hitting the point :p
http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/deus-ex.jpg
best. night. ever.
07Hi all.
I agree that it's been somewhat stagnant and that it doesb't keepnew users long
DEUS EX'ED.

I need to ask Twilight about that one.
thanks derpy
applecest
Yeah cheers babe
I think we've all stressed that the community is one of the biggest problems
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q6M6pO_2s
this is awesome
Winning lol
noo you cut off the end with twilight
WINNING.
Neighing

Gozer is a weird Shub-Niggurath/Cthulhu/Yog-Sothoth inspired thing. Except it takes a human-like form.
ok
Well, when I first came to TST, I stayed because someone said "Welcome to TST blah blah blah" in a forum games topic where I posted :p
A 200-foot tall marchmallow man?
time to find out..
I decided to stay because of that (that was idiotshadow btw)
No, the god/goddess thing.
*rips head off*
whine whine errywheer
06of course there's the little things like not making people feel more like noobs than they have a reason to feel like ("learn to google" and the like) but that's kind of common sense
dat lotr
dat epicface
I honestly think the forum games board is one of the key places to keep users
dat bi-winning
That and Pokémon discussion :P
02however. it shouldn't @ Pat =\
I think this may be my effect on chatrooms
BANG BANG!

02Game boards is like one of the only boards alive.
hiya :]
For example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4nAUPw8j5s&playnext=1&list=PL8BC7F9AC19E7781E
Xeli well
/me shoots Spread Gun!
E.V.E?
online mmorpg
You know one of the things that I don't like/tolerate is stupidity :p
Hellew
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAA!
the catch: One server. the world is the UNIVERSE
06Well there's a difference between stupidity and inexperience
One. Server.
I don't like MMORPGs that much.
How do I third-person? *Spiderman shrug*
But you should try
Yes
/me 7is back
oh...we're not doing that anymore
type /me
/me waves hello
If they're simply inexperienced then I try to help. Stupidity on the other hand...
7*nod*
I totally vote this because autotune is legit :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc
/me talks in third person all t he time
WoW sucks now
/me does too
WoW always sucked.
Cata has nothing on old school Naxx 40-man
because I didn't want him/her to become another Haii :p
vid*
Anyway, back on topic
xD
7naxx 40 was awesome
06It's just wrong that is all
I was there
Xeli, yes
yes
I only like MMORPG's for the opportunities for interaction with an established group of players in a more social context than most other online multiplayer games can provide without the use of clans or such things of the sort.
Thank you!!
/me glomps FluffyWuffs
I somehow manged to make the #AfterDark channel talk about FPSes
/me 7waves back to everyone
I WAS THERE.
It's weird
I think people just make assumptions
7welcome home
AD channel seems pretty queit right now
whats going on in the afterdark channel?
Not me
#EquestriaAfterDark
they just do porn there, dont they?
most of the time, yes
No, they're the same as here.
Just kind of watching guys
sometimes, it's pretty PG as well
They can just talk about porn also.
sometimes..
"Luna won't you cry for mee"
In some ways, this place is very close knit
07Hm..
yes
sometimes
:]
In my experience, it's mainly normal.
Either way, I manage to completely change the topic
All the time.
07Luna is correct
07Also
Whenever I join the TF2 wiki IRC, we talk about philosophy.
or videos they want played, I mean
Yeah, Luna, it's an "inner circle"
That's also the other thing
I'm the same way
Sure.
07I admit
want link to playlists?
first it's the topic, then it's the friends.
pony philosophy...?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/ponies-awarded-for-epic-hacking-fails.html
07I could change this...
07*should
I only really stay here for friends and some other things
Not usually this crowded, but it can be
It's mostly the community that compells me to stay here
07mhm
time to find out?
07Well
7Indeed; I stayed for the community.
(lol sasuke)
Meh to WoW
^
07There's a challenge I see here that I don't know how to tackle
i never read the rules
LOL
But I know you guys aren't stupid :p
We're going to have fun
07that too but
With scieeeeeenceeeeeeee
...lol
which one wins?
Bit, can I say 'crap' and get away with it?
:D
Well, yes
07young users
I have the most fun when my friends are online, but I also have fun with everyone else who's there
ELT we know the answer
07and then there are older users
7because of the friends I made
well I dont :<
06Of course, the trick is to not go like
awwwwwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Well, I think people don't know that "noob" and "newbie" are two different words
>loves this song
Rainbow Kamehameha of harmony
am i the only one that is creeped out when Twilight opens her glowing eyes?
07Indeed
Eh, I play City of Heroes for my MMO fix
07Well
/me runs away
are you sure?
lmao
I was too.
that just comes the **** out of nowwhere
MY EARS!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
yeah...my guild was pretty pissed when I left
06and yeah
07those people usually shoved into that category are younger users
Right on Flamerunner!
There have been a couple of moment where I just think ponies is about to turn into the scariest thing
/me tuts
07and then the older aged people can get snappy
yeah
like
that one time
07how to ... change that?
/me slaps Flamerunner
Pinkie Pie
where
she looses it
booooooo
no, not cupcakees
>:O
07I just think that whole thing, the way people present themselves, and the counterreactions creates a division.
/me staggers back
yessss
shes alright
that's my fave episode!
7why did you left?
/me threw a pokeball
WUBWUB
mine too
My ears are full of blood.
Cata, hated the changes
(requesting
sadf
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW :'(
)
yeah, that too
It's the attitude of the community, which is incredibly hard to change unless they want it to change
07Lakorv I dont uderstand that sentence LOL can you re-tell it to me? XD
I dunno. Anything DBZ is just plain overpowered anyway you slice it...
07and yeah
not part 1 dbz
i mean DB
Can an HDMI cable connect the groups together?
you mean, over 9000?
07LOOOL
!!!!
*runs*
yeah thats pretty powerfull
Unless everyone pursues a common go-
7sounds interesting though
looooool
well
whatninethousand!?
I quit wow when wotlk happened
7why?
07ah, the older ones
fighting powah, 1 million!!!
blasphemy
Panderia? Come on, that's just a marketing ploy
I think by Android Saga, anyone can blow up earth. Even Yamcha.
Yeah
young ones', even. Silly apostrophe got astray.
!seen light
Flamerunner: The last time I saw light was Fri 29 Jul 2011 12:52:38 PM CEST
Even Chi Chi.
7Actually I loved wotlk
7as a huntress
Chichi?
my guild dieded
Light is racist.
l8r
i dont like DB
I'm willing to be more friendly
Chi Chi could blow up the earth twice
Yes.I have MANY sons.
pshhhhhhht
07Mhm
Dishes don't wash themselves
07though
she cant even blow up a bulding
I had a lot of problems with wotlk, but the immense increase in story telling made it forgiveable
nya nya nya
Son.I am dissapoint
07Because I mean
ever noticed that DB looks like a disturbed smilie?
/vegeta
Dman: Eenope
Not my thing really.
07people ARE self-serving in the sense that they include those they know they can count on from before.
you ought to start at the lower-most level; yourself. Ourselves.
@Ziltoid:What?
aww..ok man
*nostalgic sigh* I remember my guild's first LK down...
it was magical...
SAD FOR YOUUUUUU
7Yes as it was for me
you*
7that vid!
/me appears out of nowhere and kicks Lycan
07i've heard you quote that
07a few times
my guild disbanded :(
Light murdered criminals regardless of race.
Heh
but he killed more Japs than anyone
07ah
but that was a long time ago
xD
07Ascendant
To you guys at least
Meh, I really don't like how they changed the singing.
Or the song.
07not saying you should, but
07Hm
He just knew more.
07here's something
Lycan
I tolerate people pretty well
you're a wat.
yeah its too fast
Lycan that doesn't work
I have a high-risk factor of being stupid.
the vibrato sound really weird
I tolerate people pretty well as well, just not stupid people
no u ._.
13I tolerate people way too much .w.
no u stfu.
yarly.
^
/me has an existential crisis
vampires are no linger cool
I just fk off when I don't feel like being annoyed anymore.
I lost interest in the WoW story when they killed off anyone I had a decent interest in
longer*
07how to make people want to be more ... tactful
07when communicating outside their own group
07without
well
07being too lenient?
I'm tactful, I just don't prefer to do it that way :p
Illidan was baws
7I have all the books *innocent look*
07Mhm
MMOs - GRIND GRIND GRIND
When I think of vamps
And the other Blood Omen stuffs, myes.
That's it
They're usually fun for the first couple of weeks for me.
lol umad dari?
7*goes off taking a picture*
Got to lvl 48 in one 30 hour play. then didn't play for the rest of the month
07Indeed, but we do have the rules as a guideline
when i think of vampires
:D
i try to think of Hellsing
07BASICALLY
i think of marshmallo- i mean rarity
i hate animes
and mangas
07well, I'm talking about more people than just you though, I'm wondering how we can make the inclusion thing an appealing goal for everyone.
07Mhm
well the hate you too
Yeah
Well,he's ANOTHER one of my sons.
they are too much child like..
Val Hellsing
all of the mare the same
Everyone believes in different things
Val kyrie
oh sheeeettt
But the first step is to raise awareness
rockets.
I like an anime if it's decent enough. :/
If you guys were stupid I wouldn't talk to you
its always the same formular
07Lakorv... LOL
AKA not 'tarded fillar for 200 episodes or something dumb like that.
;p
07that won't work here!
:P
lmao
Yeah.I'm BAWS.

Ew, FFXIV.

it's forum based, no?
the Bible sucks
^this

Partially
^This again
This community is more IRC than forum imo
07Yeah
FFXI is alright. I'm mostly just jealous that I'll never play it.
as in, threaded, topic-based webforum?
Most of the regulars go on IRC
/me kills FluffyWuffs Sam Fisher Style
That's where most my bashing stems from.
Eh?

07OH WELL.

7nope
Lolk
gather more people for an informative meeting and make people realise.
You're high
somebrony sent it to me
But the forums are also important because that's where most people start out :p
I once did a parody of my character Kersha dressed as Ke$ha, named it Ker$ha

11Meh, I can do without House.
07I like the shoutbox o.O
I can get scared if I turn around and I didn't know someone was there. I have high nerves. And I regularly read fanfictions written by the most derelect the world has to offer us.
11No.
YES

6Indeed.. :P

Never really tried my hand at music.

Pretty much
See thing for me is I've noticed

Stop now.
I'm back from serving meals to homeless people
(Dman, pic didn't work)
07Ascendant, I believe as we grow more experienced in leadership roles our strengths and weaknesses become clearer and clearer

hey Sathi
7just wondering
Let me guess Marshmelon
7if a pic doesnt work
I'd say the one I loved the most on first seeing her would be Fluttershy.

It was like
http://i.imgur.com/hlaGL.jpg
I thought it was a moustache.
7and click on popout?
OH
no
THIS ADVERT
If a pic doesn't work, give Dman 10 seconds
I remember
sometimes it just disappears
The moment she went all reclusive, I just wanted to pik her up and hug her.
...
WUT IS THIS?
... don't know this ad
/me 's favourite is Rarity
wait...
12or?
yea sathi always working for me
07I know my strength is inclusion, and my weakness is that I sometimes act too quickly and when that happens I lack perspective.
can you call that an accent?
i guess not
also sathi apparently vid links make a link appear on the right?
Applejack and Dash are at the bottom of me list right now.
You totally can call it an accent because it is.
07anyway
wheat worms?!
is it cuz of an addon?
Aww, seeya ):
Fluttershy IN Luna!?
Watch it

Anyway, does anyone else have any input?
Shipping is a story of a relationSHIP between two characters. As writing such a story is a verb, we describe the act as a verb.
that's adsa price CHINK CHINK
Hi Kitten :o
interesting that just as I randomly joined the channel, there'd be a meeting within an hour.
tesco. errylittlehelp
10Needs more involvement, as already mentioned
maybe not
I am SURE nopony saw that inb4 coming!
For me, I don't like most of it because it's NOT MEANT TO HAPPEN in the universe most of the time, or wouldn't make much sense to me.
Anyway
Shipping isn't always bad
but often is
10I could help organise a PO tournament, I like organising things :P

But whatever. XD

10Ascendant, did HoR's PO server have less admins/mods around?
Episode 1 & 2: "GO DOWN, MOON!"
I wanted to start from Ep1, but he went otherwise

1 and 2 arent that good
3 was meh
it's cadbury i aint gonna explain chocolate!
of course
but it was a good episode to start with
I have no mouth and i must scream.
because its not as girly as some of the moments in 1 and 2
1 & 2 were ANIME

Suppose it was, it had good gags and all the characters were given time to shine

Kersha, I plan to fix the Tiwlight image, and probably won't even include the text
Someone linked a pic and I opened it on stream.
the text would be hard and repetative and not worth it.

lol
I go in there
12i saw a strategy online
how does that even work?
Well if the EqD RP is boring you should say that, not that just RP is boring ;p
It's text-walls about one pony
12for peeling them where you just remove the top and bottom
unless youv rp'ed
lol
I know a morsel of Morse code.
EqD rp IS boring
A strategy for peeling eggs? :P
12yes
And they're all like, "Oh, it's okayu!"
oo
7even the middle of the arctic
12and you just blow through one end and the egg is supposed to come out the other
7technically called the north pole
mehehehehe
teehee
12find and dandy if you are making them for yourself but if you are making them for someone else they might not respect that XD
There's a pole there? They could just transmit wifi from up there, then.

12this one episode someone cut their hand while preparing food
I doubt people always get their own inside jokes. But I believe the discussion of /b can be summarized by the following: /b was never good.
zomg
12and just kept working with the food while they were bleeding into it
/me squees a bit and dies for a moment.
12yeah that person got taken out first XD

the pentagram in that pic...
I think its just a pentagram
Blargle
It is a ritualistic pentagram
I'm awfully tempted to break one of the cardinal rules of good fic writing
14hmm
>mfw incoming chatlag
which is?
14how do you make it bigger lol
which is?
13LOL
Use a pump
Shipping an OC with a MC.
Well
14lol shutup k
Oh why not go ahead
Actually I suppose it wouldn't be a main character
9enemies from the Eureka 7 movie
shutdown -k
But still technically an existing one
Oh, never heard of it.
>good
>fic
Pic one
03LOL
/me cackles
*Pick
There is good fic and there is bad fic!
good
All fics are inherently bad by their own nature
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYX1HzRiIpM
My favriot inanimate object is Knives. Knives and Gunblades
hello
Wait Actually Knives,gunblades, and sythes
>sythes
Scythes?
*OC ponies mean?
oh
...
or Character
yeah, that!
Or that
cool
people would probably complain if you just made them friends probably >_>
Whereas MC would be Main Character
I'l be back
Mane Character*
Ha, yes. XD
03hm
03but all she has is IE and it blocks IE :/
MC = Main Character, SC = Support Character, BC = Background Character
03how do I help her x.x
might as well do them all
*instant pic of Slendermane*
*Mane
. _ .
I suppose in this case it would be an OC and a BC.
I've seen bits and pieces of the show.
/me doesnt read fanfics
It's a romantic anime.
13MSN has some kind of mini browser-type thing
7Eh?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ2q9NmYf6g
/me doesn't read fanfics because schoooooooool.
/me shrugs
This is creepy.
13use that to download another browser
13xD
03Yes
lol
o lawd
03The thing that goes "You have 70 infections"
7It blocks only IE?
03Well
7Antivirus?
9it's actually meant to be a coming of age story, but yeah
But only Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash stickers are stuck to my laptop right now. :p
03I assume she doesn't have antivirus
Dash= best pony
03they can take over most antiviruses
7What's it called?
yeah.
03No idea.
back
But... you can't easily remove stickers D:
http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/IMG_1842.jpg
Well yeah.
/me laughs
03the problem is, if she runs TeamViewer I can help her get rid of it, but that requires a browser to run...
I scanned the stickers and made backups. :P
03which means Malwarebytes should help
Gorramit, you beat me to it.
And... they gave me sticker transfer inkjet paper. xD
9it also aired as a kid's show in Japan
9so yeah
Sometimes
I can't imagine having bumper stickers that aren't magnets
I don't ahve any stickers on my comp
9(GL, I mean)
I like Derpy for best BC though, I tend to like the cute ones
Because they make a mess when you remove them
People ask why I used pinecones as a weapon.
12hmm
Sometimes
Which is why Luna and Fluttershy are my favorite characters
i dreaaaam about cheeeeeese
Well they have pines on theme
I simply not-smile at them and say "Because they won't let me use knives."
MC = Mane Character
BC = Background Character
Main!
lycan: I lol'd muchly
MOOFINS!
the word is main
O_O I know my caffeine.
Mane is a pony joke
eitherway
*badum tch*
*eyes fall out*

/me is erectin' a dispencer

7Then I edited the startup console or whatever it's called and unchecked it from starting up at the start.

Oh great

Silly apple

And is Unix supposed to be free?
:P

Or is it both
Okay then

/me cries
I think apple is using the GPL license
03Ascendant i dare you to get a Live Free or Die license plate
http://www.opensource.apple.com/
03that says UNIX
03on it

9DEM TITS
03there's that one state thats slogan is Live Free or Die
03so someone got one that said UNIX

Speaking of girl names

BOOBS.
lindows
I did hear someone official changed their middle name to Fluttershy, but no one really cares about middle names
No
Not that again
Aka Unbootu
lindows is a horrible OS
9DAT GURREN-DAN FLAG
EW UBUNTU
Hello
Haha
oh. This name actually predates me knowing about Kingdom Hearts and possible predates KH as well, but I'm less sure of that
03LOL lindows
03have you heard of reactOS though?
That thing has the most hilarious running animation ever.
possibly, even.
I need to beat Kingdom hearts too... probably won't
I don't play many games any more =/
/me does
looooool reactos
then try to work it out
/me ponders over it a moment, "Too complicated."
03haha
03>Norton
Rachels
/me tilts her head, "Oh, no. Nopony is."
Rachels was close
/me gives up
Fail
Something happen?
that'd be more secure
grrr, put the Ch in the wrong place
actually no
Not sure
Norton has actually worked well for me
I knew that a girls name didn't make any sense...
Here he goes again
I just hate seeing senseless bashing
?
norton catches too much
As in
sorry :P
it gives a lot of false positives
thanks alot
starnight fanon wise yes
canon it has never been confirmed
It's just a fun little bit of fannon.
I like it though.
I remember when I first got my laptop
It had Mcafee on it, blocked everything IRC related
And slowed everything down too :p
lol mcafee
mcafee can gdiaf
03^
03so can Norton
funnily enough there's a McAfee building a blocks away from my school
03both are pathetic piles of crap
/me thinks back and shrugs, "I slept some. Been to wrapped up in personal work to nap."
…Blinky Pie?
03Ascendant

9trying to hook up tablet
Burn it down
I like that people named Pinkie's sisters after pacman characters
Hah
lmao
there's also a Cisco building
Cisco LOL
As well as Inky Pie, Sue Pie, and Clyde Pie
Inky, Blinky, Pinkie, and... sue

I would rather have false positives than an infection
Never had a Cisco product before
think of putting the gurren lagann ost while drawing?
Well dont overwork yourself...
9gonna use the SRW OST
I'd rather have no anti-virus and no viruses at all
darnit
For some reason I'm really tempted to click that link to Equestriaafterdark... Is that bad?
only 1 or 2 TTGL songs on it
And the price for norton just makes it even worse
AVG lol
DO IT
…what link?
GIVE INTO UR HATE
AVG isn't that bad
9so uh
??
AVG I tried
9if it is, get some people here
best setup though, is having no antivirus
but did nto like it much
9there we go
get spybot
9tablet is live
*not
I can't
and a few other things
isn't spybot free?
Ahh

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
Manly, manly tears

That part
;_;
9Just direct them to the dinkypage one

lol at spybot's example image
WATCH THIS SHOW
http://www.safer-networking.org/images/live_protection_beta3.png
I meant for me :P
…ambiguous asterisks are ambiguous
I liked Gurren Lagann
When I watched TTGL
It's the only anime I've ever watched
germanpornhijack.exe
Niice, Germans
I enjoyed it.
I want Cased Closed ponies.

plus Norton is working fine for me
<Celestia> You rang, ^RainbowDash?
Gengar... *shudder*
o.o
mook go back to /a/
okay.jpg
We're talking about anime apparently
yup
I'm only stating mine
any specific anime?
its caught a whole bunch of crap
top five anime
ttgl
Yes
not really
I've seen several Gurren Lagann references in FiM
exp the glasses
Well, norton does do that but I don't like its false positives
Still in tears
I am stating my thoughts on the issue
I haven't seen any references
When did I call for Celestia?
It all starts from the browser, just sayin' :P
<Celestia> You said, "OH GOD".
you are being kind of arrogant about it
you
03...
03Ascendant
03and now it says
lol at ad timing out
03Cannot find a program to open .exe files
03WTF do I do
O.o
lolwut
REGISTRY TIME
Boondocks is western
xD
well the emoticons kind of give it away
yeah probably registry
joking aside, i like Ga-Rei Zero
/a/ ?
Did you ignore the "counts to me part"
without meaning
In an English context, anime refers to Japanese animation
don't take it personally :p
Of course not
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/bfb1c15e9a7ccdc468056f00244e6077/3522%20-%20crossover%20Gurren_Lagann.png
Apparently he did
yeah, there's no references
the :p one usually acompanies a sly remark
or an arrogant remark
I don't care
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505
Lol
I don't use it that way
I found like 15 references with a single search lol
I don't use random emoticons
I think we're talking about actual referencers
heck I don't use them period
top 4 for me
Not fanon nonsense
Well, everyone's different
You're just boring :P
I'm not saying you have to :p
Plus if we say it just means japanese animation than a lot of other shows count to.
no need for that :p
avatar?
right?
its because people abuse them
Sorry :p
lot of my favorites are relatively old
(little kids, not blue people)
A lot of shows are animated by japanese companies.
http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-exe-file-asso-windows-7-vista-incorrectly-associated/ < This too
Slayers, Escaflowne, Nausica/PrincessMonoke/every other movie that guys made lol
Slayers is great
never seen it
03ah
03I found it
Then you must bleed.
but i see it on netflix aLL THE TIME
I rather enjoyed Rune Soldier
I like Summar Wars
Or if you don't do that, then at least ooze fatally.
summer wars was great
well its a habit worth breaking
gunxsword was good too
It's similar in some respects to Slayers
It's a habit that I don't mind :p
I don't think it's such a horrible habit
Back to 2ch with me
Is Slayers Gorgeous the one with the Amazing Lina-Doll?
Did I help DRF? :o
Especially where text can be taken the wrong way
I cry though, I've never seen NEXT... and I cannot find it without having to buy the entire first 3 series included >_>
YES
Timelords and Terror was amazing, it had such diction, description, characterization, and personification that I could only dream of being skilled enough to use
Heh, it's all a matter of perspective
HAHAHA I loved that one
and naga's golem... >_>
Hurr yeah
I find emoticon abuse a bit annoying
Colossal bouncing boobs
and at times its misleading
That was hilariou
**hilarious
Agreed*
lmao
imo you're taking this all too seriously, no offence
Legend of korra?
all this non pony talk is disturbing the force lol
I think we're alienating people here lol
Doesn't Legend of Korra come out in 2012
aww
I don't think the subject is limited to ponies
9good gosh
if it was we'd run out of things to talk about eventually.

The tears from Simply Rarity need no such feeble excuse.
I mean it in the way to not take it seriously
Oh through

Yeah but no one lets you use OCs not even for random drawings.
well there aren't enough colts, i agree.

Do it like they do it on the discovery channel.
i would... and i am going to regret saying this:
