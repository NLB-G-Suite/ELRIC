Oooh
0Dermathil, bro, i'm watching a movie - it's got 30 mins left.
I could use an alto clef
AWWWW YEAH! GO DERMATHIL!
no problem
That's not as stupid to draw
0I'll join ya, but can't watch till ... wait, i can't watch at all : /
Lets wait for him then
0double wait - my room is tidy - i can use my harddrive to watch with y'all

Alrighty
GURREN LAGANN!
0TENGEN TOPPA
THERE.
It's done.
And hell yes I do, treble clefs are a pain to draw with pencils strung through them.
And now I can't decide if this looks better with the middle arm of the clef under the pencil or the top and bottom arms.
And its blocked where I'm currently at
sup
Yippie...
Ah well
I can always edit it later when I ink it digitally.
0same rodman

0it looks waaay better here as big

0the one with sword?
0or face of other one?

0so uh i'm off to a spa for 2 hours or some thing

Bye Dman.
0GIIIIGAAAAA

I figured Eurobeat Brony would wait till the 2nd season to make a new album. What all does he have left from the first season too work with?
/me Darth Mauls
I dunno what the Goodbye decade stream is
alright brb shower time

and I mean
!drftime
wait
no desktop
OH! NRGFORCE!
it was overheating
almost forgot bout him :D
Blarg. Flatmate is busy using his PC which means I can't use the scanner as it's in his room.
he's awesome
anyway, 12:18PM and I'm fricking tired
0bai all
What's he done?
You'll all have to wait to see what Sketchy looks like I'm afraid, folks.
06then go sleep
argh stupid antivirus
DragonBorn: he did like the instrumental covers
I'm in class
Sketchy_Sounds: unplug scanner and move to your room? :P
inb4 do it anyway
I would but it's too much hassle.
I'd have to sit the scanner on my bed or something
trying to reinstall a game and for some reason my AV has to scan .exe files even when they are 6GB
Ohhh ok. yeah those are really good. Dumb question but how do you respond to someone with their name in bold like that?
Bye
You type their name.
And I has to sleep
Oh wow. That simple huh? Thanks!
So cyall laters
do it anyway
Yep, that simple. you're welcome.
06i once slept 3 hours straight ni class, and the teacher knew it, he didn't even care xD
it's called highlighting, keeps you from missing when someone addresses you in busy channels.
Considering that was my first time drawing such a lanky critter I don't think I did too badly.
NRGFORCE inspired me to play WWU on piano :D
If I could work out or find the chords for it I'd totally take a crack at WWU on guitar.
You guys still watching Gurren Lagann (sp?)?
there oughta be something for it at everyponysings
also depending on your client, you can tab-complete the last nick to hilight you at the beginning of a line. ...even though he left >___>
No idea how good these are, but here: http://www.everyponysings.com/2010/05/winter-wrap-up-tabs.html
(the tabs I got for Art of the Dress off that site were really incomplete)
they have the tabs for WWU at ultimate-guitar.com
Ooh
seriously? that's awesome
back
Oh actually the chords seem quite straightforward
C, F, G for the chorus
I wanna know what that F looks like though
And then the same for the beginning of each verse, then Am, G, C, F
F? You know how to play a C?
is it 133211 or the other one?
the tabs said you have to tune it down :s
F is a barred E on the first fret
which is, uh... xx3211?
bah, tuning
Or alternatively xx3211
rest*
/me ego strokin1
I have a real hard time on the barre, which is of course why it's in all the songs I try to play
I have no probem barring :3
D:
anyone care to upload their pony folder to media fire?
Howdy.
Hmm
That was actually very easy to play
^^
Ohai everypony!

gummy looks best in socks
Good morning
This image is freaking ginormous
...I've never seen Gummy in socks.
the reason we don't have any pics of him in socks is because the artist dies of diabetes before they can upload
Hey Sean
Xiagu dammit you keep making me laugh in real life.
WHAT A TWIST!
And no, Gummy doesn't look best in socks, he looks best in dapper tap shoes
Mission complete? ^^
/me monocle smile.
Gonna upload the sketch of... Sketchy.
Xiagu: did the artist really died? :s
At least three fatal attempts so far
I ain't dead!
I'll fix that!

Pfft, I go by "Fall" on the blog, but that was registered too.

Fall as in to fall or Autum fall?

So I got meself a father for to call meself his son
Did you get my two requests?
Yeah, I'll scroll up and get them.
I always go by "ELT" everywhere in the interweb
is never taken
Fall as in, the first word I thought of when I looked down at the keyboard and saw the letter 2F"
nice process
That just makes me d'awwww
Xiagu has worked pretty well for me too :D
It sounded nice.
INB4 epic
I type a random letter and slowly add letters till it resembles something coherent
fall silently is the song that ships with fl studio
^true
Hmm?
And then everyone exploded
helo
AtomicBrony, hey you.
i changed me name
Huzzah for SRW
Hey yoself
/me hugs Octavia
I think it would just make everyone think of the episode fall
/me hugs Atomic tightly, "Thank you, I needed that."
Aww
Yeah, that too.
I love this song

SO
We call the Fall "Autumn" where I am.

Rainbow Dash + Danger Zone
D&D game with Silvermane as the Dungeon Master.
Johnny Cash Reggae?
The buckets aren't strictly RP, they're really "do whatever you want and don't leave a mess" and "escape from super-busy-crazy-mane-chatrooms" channels.
Dat silvemane
*Silvermane

*GRENADE
knock knock
o.o
I'D CATCH A GRENAAAAAAAAAAAAAADE FOR YA.
Rainbow dash would not approve of all this scandelous shipping
Rainbow dash doesn't ship with bitches
Fans don't care, their word superscedes word of god or character.
Bitches ship with Rainbow Dash.
Well if you believe the fanon, yes, she absolutely would.
Shipping shall be shipped until Hasbro deems no more!
Shipping shall go on
not even Canon can stop Fanon
Hmm
TOMAHAWK TO THE FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE FOR YA.
All ponies are lesbian, Pinkie Pie and Apple Bloom are mass murderers, Derpy is a god more powerful than Luna AND Celestia combined...
What would be the piracy to your shipping?
A 180, I suppose...
Derpy is golden
I as a newfoaul(?) am able to ship EVERYTHING
DirtxRocks
Also every pony has a sad/grimdark backstory
dat connection fail.
foal?
s/with/to
Not every pony Kershal
HL2: DM frags are better than MW2/CoD by infinity :P
oh, just like intervention.
EVERY
PONY
Maybe
What about a star wars Crossover
yes
Meh, I liked MW2.
Dat Code Geass
INB4 hate
Stare Wars. Derpy as Luke.
There's a Pony for that
What pony doesn't have sad/grimdark backstory?

Oh MAH CELESTIA Airborn, GENIUS
derpy
KershaFangs: the pony that doesn't exist yet.
Rainbow day
Im playing Star Wars Galaxies and chatting IM MULTITASKING
W?
Wut?
And as soon as that pony is created, it will have a saddark story.
Too late, sad back story is the lack of her existance and thus never being loved.
Half-Life 2 Deathmatch
In other words, Rule 34.9
did you ever play it?
"If it exists, there's a saddark fic of it"
dat MARLON BRANDO
WE DESIRE YOUR OBEISANCE, DISOBEDIENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
Nope.
Couldn't they just call that Rule 35?
that's why :P
dat JOHNNY CARSON
it pwns all shooters. period :P
Equestria is Communist
No, rule 35 is "if it doesn't exist, it will"
I only liked MW2 because of quickscoping, so I doubt it. :P
Twilight = Luke, Obi-one = Celestia?, Han-Solo = Rainbow Dash
lets invade mlp with every evil force in every fictional universe ever!
Pinkie Pie is then Chewie

Flying people?
bunny hoping
People flying around kind of sucks IMO.
jump pads
I prefer just normal jump heights. :P
I think Ponies are the nicest group evar'
Freaking rancor clan killed me
no the NICEST group every would be the teletubies or carebears or something
Me too
I'd like to request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKwNkzCnSMg
because ponies have flaws that make them relateable
DAT SHOT
reanimated pinata? i saw a dora the explorer pinata once.
perhaps it's just my nostalgia glasses, but this was an incredible game
hey all
especially considering a lot of their nade/crossbow kills are stylish
I.e INCREDIBLY hard to pull off
It does look good, I just don't really like the jumping.
carebears... CAREBEARS!
It IS HL2 after all
Hey valion1
Hellew
DAT DOUBLE BALL BLOCK
bah, bunny hoping was where it was at
twas a true sign of 1337-ness :P
Bunny hopping when you don't just fly around I'm fine with. :P
me too
>mfw rocketdodging to hit someone in the face
But when you just fly around the map it's kind of meh.
i didn't even expect the room to be active but anyway anything new as far as pony news goes or is it another slow day
true
well, most of the "flying" parts of from special maps with abnormal heights/jump pads
Yeah
the day hasnt really begun yet where I am
When you make people able to jump like that in MW2 matches suck.
ah
Its afternoon tiem
yeah
True dat dari
People just zoom around flying through the map. :P
no
it's morning
I dont think anything would be considered big news except maybe if season two started
barely
no its afternoon
clutchers at the time?
that's probably because it isn't implemented the same way
What about if Fallout Equestria or Past Sins updated?
yay for timezones!
the flying is actually REALLY hard to pull off
(clutch being only walking backwards)
Not everyone reads those fics
i've been working on a fan fic i contemplated posting it to eqdaily but their requsites seem too strict
if they are a msg is posted here by derpybot
What are you playing?
Pistol snipe?WUT.
he's streaming a HL2: DM frag I linked
Don't know if anyone's ever played a game called Gunz, that was pretty cool for doing 'pro' techniques.
Yeah, I remember Gunz.
/me Kisses Derpybot
BUTTERLY!!!
but as a preface any fans of nazi zombies here
The butterfly was pro but hard to do.
K-style it.
I could DBF.
ehhh
/me showers derpybot with cupcakes
halflife skill time/
defines...fans of Naz zombies
O_O
?
define*
Double-Butterfly?! Oh snap
I don't know how people TBF'd though, seemed kind of impossible to be.
people who play it and follow the story line
!muffins
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps AtomicBrony
whatsa butterfly
yes there is a story line
/me blushes
And they do post a lot of it, so their requisites are designed to filter out the cream.
Half-step was pretty pro too.
yeah
Who controls DerpyBot anyway?
a bot
I can't remember what the insta-down with a sword was called.
all i know is that the 4 original survivors have a TARDIS of somesort
That game was pretty pro.
I wouldn't be surprised if you could find guides for doing it
well yeah
!flip
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me lands on her back. Ouch!
there's always SOMEONE with enough time to make one :P
the Butterfly?
Yeah
Nah.
Whoops.
johnsey does
You need DA MAD SKILLZ to own at this game.
yeah
You flip someone then cut of the animation with a block.
Then jump and slash.
yeah
:)
....so how you write in itallics?
eeyup
To instant floor them, can't remember the name of it though.
/me uses /me
/me
Tardises are dangerous.. if they blow up the universe goes poof
me neither
I never got that consistantly.
Was kind of sporadic. XD
you should put a gunz pro vid
the question is, do i control her or does she control me?
That would be interesting.
Show Meet the Brony!
to show what you mean
doooo at
/ :V
derpy has no master.
basiclly my fic revolves around the ponies finding a meteor (which crashed into sweet apple acres) and intefered with Twilight's teleporting and popped them back into the teleproter at Der Riese
/me lol?
Haha, I'll try to find one Dermathil.
/me Ooooooooooh like this
yay for twiligt mass teleporting =D
For some reason, when I was watching Winter Wrap Up
/me well aint' that neet?
I thought a Transformers corssover would be the best thing ever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxMxoG_6-Wo
o.0
is there a command for "bold"?
You rock,
Yeah, they get a lot of stories involving Twilight's spells going screwy.
ELT: it's for RPing
woohoo
Dat request
pleasentville/ponyville crossover.
what about this one?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppSU5xeEMdU
maybe for once they can have rarity screw up a teleport or maybe even celestia
dat insanity vid
the cast for the fic is Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Rarity. Scootaloo, Applejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle
well twilight isn't using her teleportation on her own
But yeah, for some reason I would like to see Starscream make a little... "visit" to Equestria along with ... wonderful robot friends
And Bic Mac rapes and murders them all?
you forfot THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXI!
Interesting how Applejack has been relegated behind even Scootaloo.
celestia ends up teleporting half her body onto a wall? yea im all ofr that
Like he does in every other fic he's in?
Did you play all the quest bosses too?
Lich. :>
For epic win.
but in this case the element 115 in the meteor interacts with her magic in the same way its used with the teleporter terminals
Whats the most ridiculous pony crossover you can think of?
MLP + Gantz
I wouldn't say there's a ceiling
I should load up that game again sometime.
Finding Nemo.
dari?
It was awesome.
No I never played too much.
^
The ponies will all drown, of course.
Wasn'T very good.
There's an infinite amount of material
never even pulled the butterfly off.
My Little Dilbert
sea.. horses?
It's the bottom of the ocean after all.
Ahh, I played it quite a lot, got to lvl 60 or something.
oh and the pony cast even teams up with the crew from call of the dead
Though, I suppose there's already MLP vietnam, so...
I had about 5-6 characters. XD
._.
MLP + Real Life
2 different accounts.
shoobie do wop
Lol.
Holy guacamoles batman.
nice
MLP + Shamwow Commercial
MLP reality show?
Has there been a crossover with War of the Worlds?
yes i referenced the sea ponies
...
MLP+Downstreamers
MLP/shamwow pic has been done
that reminds me of my WoW addiction :P
shawn of the dead
MLP/AlanWake been done
MLP/Scanners
i doubt there's an upper ceiling
Haha.

well, my former WoW addiction
....
I've never played WoW.
fortunately I quit a few months ago
don't, it sucks now
My little pony/fist of the north star
MLP/Halo done....badly
MLP/Marvel
I thought WoW was mediocre.
it's a needless waste of money
My Little Strong Bad.
MLP/Spawn
MLP+DBZ?
xD
Oh god, MLP/Halo. That would probably ruin both of them for me.
when did you play it Pegacorn?
has*
I tend to do things I like pretty obsessively.
theres two mlp/halo crossovers
Already one around, with dash as an ODST I believe
4 months ago.
yea
I guess that makes sense.
that's why :P
The Gunz pro vid?
I play wow, I'm a huntard
But TF2 I can handle.
ever since Cata it's a wasteful pile of crap
its over 9000, rainbow dash.
TF2 is inherently goofy
but as far as my zombie cross over its pretty cool
Heavy wrote Cupcakes BTW
MLP + DBZ i'd read
goofy and grimdark
Dermathil: I'm playing requests in order of post
Dash is a force a nature
My Little Dinosaur Comics
Twilight already went super saiyajin in canon
Rainbow Dash and scootaloo team with Dempsey

ELT, not so ridiculous
MLP/Dr Who is everywhere
Epic half step
MLP + Gurren lagann
/me finds a fiery-looking down feather somewhere in the clouds above the clouds. {How did this get here?} She proceeds to stick it behind her ear. "Well, it looks lovely..."
FOR GREAT JUSTICE
Twlight Sparkle has the same hairstyle
lol
Dat gravity
My Little Dr. McNinja
It's because of wall climbing Pegacorn. :P
MLP/Stargate sone
done
and the butterfly helps at getting air
You cut the animation to flip off the wall short.
MLP/Battletech was done...very well
Gtg,my mom has to go on the computer for a while.I'll be back soon.
no prob
Ok.
that was actualy pretty good
Cya.
There hasnt been a fic where Atlantis lands on equestria though
/me feels her grasp of clouds disappear, and she falls... all the way down back into the chatroom.
My Little Jo Jo's Bizzard Adventure
funny that you don't like "HL2 Flying" yet this wall hoping is okay :P
My Life as a Teenage My Little Pony
I should stream gunz some time.
DO EET
X-J Pie
The game is more geared to it Val. :P
Avatar, the last airpony
/me faints mid-fall, as the down feather dissipates into thin air.
This isn't much like an FPS.

My Little Smash Bros.
There's a Predators comic and there's an Aliens fic, unfinished
My Little Power Puff Girls

My little Majora: The Moon is Magic
No Smash brothers, but a Street Fighter one is around

Maybe it's because this is 3rd person.

My Little Star Wars
My Little One Piece

yeah, 3rd person helps prolly
And it feels right in this game.
Citizen Pony
Dead Rising
ponify it.
Kirby would probably be... not so ridiculous
butterfly!
My little Diablo
The Misadventures of Derpy
My Reguler Pony
well, in that case I would argue it's because we haven't played the respective games we're refering to
The misadventures of derpy... I dont need derpy turned into something more creepy than Cupcakes pony
Gears of Pony
um, I played both game.
because when I played DM, it was seamless and well integrated
Adventure Time; PONY STYLE!
It's always sunny in fillydelphia.

Sonic was never good after Sonic and Knuckles.
>raaaaaaaage
I'm thinking of making a Jim James pony, and I'll call him My Little Morning Jacket.
Once it strayed from its 2D roots, it simply dove into a neverending spiral.
indeed :P
I may have to go to Michael's and make pony sock puppets of my own
The Pegasus, the Earth Pony and the Unicorn
and then stalk/harass DCD on ponychan with them :P

Also sonic underground... hold on i need some brain bleach
well, shoe on head is great and all
Ponific Overtures?
BUT I WAS PROMISE SOCK PUPPETS
That's a good musical, Pacific Overtures.
Never gets performed, though.
Sonic Adventure was good...except for the Sonic part.
There is Nothing like a Mare? :3
And the Sega part.
That's South Pacific.
Also a good musical.
It could've been a good game, though.
doctor Horrible/ Mlp?
Ah! I never seen Pacific Overtures then.
You lie! I know all you mods are one giant collective conscious
Nope. Never gets performed.
Rocky Horror Pony Show?
you're just distracting me so you wont have to show me them!
There was, like, one production of it this year.
Someone did that one.
In Japan.
I SEE THROUGH YOUR LIES
Poorly.
Did someone say SAYYYGAH?
I saw an "Assassins" PMV.

Yes.
You killed it.
F*CK YEA
that reminds me...I need to find a decent PMV to show co-workers at lunch today
bronies- you doth have a task!
show me the best PMVs!

something pony related :P

this one fit so well though...
PMV = Pony Music Video
How can it not be pony related?
:P
oh right
*has entered*
hahaha
I understood AMV
Top Gun is the reason why Women faint at the mention of IceMan
.. :p
I just watched Ghost Adventures and they captured a three clawed hand on vid.
Age gate; Who here's re-wound more VHS tapes than cassettes?
No clue what you guys are talking about. it seems boring.
lol
may i have a link to bucket of holding, please?
i didn't listen to much music when i was younger
so cassettes weren't really a big issue for me
was sad that anthology wasn't well received...they didn't know most of the songs from it
did make me sad pony :P
Why don't you just show them an episode?
:P
well, that much I couldn't convince them unfortunately
yet >: D
The anthology is as long as an episode. O_o
though one is my sister, who is already a brony :P
IT'S DONE
yeah
wasn't length related, they just didn't want to see an episode
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Tah-daaah~!
...
>_>
actually, the anthology is 2 minutes longer than an episode
I may redo the colouration of his cutie mark but otherwise that's him done
And damn did that take forever x_x
this looks like a weird crossover of dragon ball z and robotech...
this is WAY more awesome than that.
Gurren Lagann sucks.

IT SHOWED DARKRIA'S HAND! Three clawed fingers, no thumb or pinkie. :s
k
i see ;p
The mark's an alto clef with a pencil threaded through it.
nope
It would have been a treble clef but that was proving too much of a pain to draw, so I decided screw that
does it work for other synchtubes?
http://synchtu.be/Dermathil try this one
I'm going to go type more of my fanfic...
Bye!:D
oh gosh it existed
still nothing
oAo
so what does the cutie mark represent...and all that jazz
why does this exist
darnit.
Well, he's basically a ponified representation of me - so it represent his talent for drawing and making music.
try once more that I ain't in the room
still nothing
neat
FFFFF
check your pms then
Back.
welcome back
What you streaming Dermathil? Gurren Lagann?
Synchtubing it
we should totally stream the old Robotech season
The difference being?
dat Russian Captain
well, trying to
Well, the difference is it only is youtube videos and if it is blocked in your country you can't watch it.
Oh.
I might watch it with you.
To see what it's like.
Fuuuuuu-
I hear that it is banned over there
:P
I hear Dari munching on noms :P
Pasta.
And thus, the cbox has died once again
by MY hand!
Valthejean, pm.
this chat needs to have something to draw your attention to PMs
I never notice when I get them >.<
the text turns blue
well, something more...noticeable than that
Get a proper client.
:P
O_o
It's noticeable enough on mIRC.
is this chat working in hydraIRC?
never actually used it unfortunately
He's definitely giving Celestia a run for her money in lankiness.
It'll work in any IRC client.
owait.
I don't even think hydraIRC supports color chat.
It'll still work.
Just won't show colours.
yeah I know, but then it'll be boring
mIRC is best client anyway.
I'll have to look into it at some point
what does it mean when it says that i need voice?
It means that the mod has set mute mode

LUNA LUNA!

So I'm most likely to draw her
despite her having an ocean of fanart already
i wish somebody could draw me a pony.
I could
if only they knew what my hair looked like..
yeah, and i also dunno my cutie mark.
Well from that regard I couldn't lol

I've been on a pony art kick of late so I'm cool with drawing things for people when the mood takes me.
I'm pretty sure I saw some Ponyfied DBZ
the beta pony creator doesnt have a hair style that fits mine very well.
Kittens.
!muffin
... sakura leaves what sakura leaves leaves aren't pink all I see are petals
.-.
o.o
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Yes. You're a bit slow, dear.
/me eats all the muffins
sorry there are not more
DerpyBot is unusually slow.
i am confused.
Oh god.I KILLED THE CHAT!
It's a berpy bot
Why so Summer?
/me is sooo busy delivering mail
should i make a pony based on MY appearance or just the way i want it to look?
i kinda want both
Why so Summer?
let's put some sunshine in that face!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
why so Summer?
/me facehoofs
Uhhhhh
Waken up 3 PM
Not the best start
it's MONDAY MONDAY!
Gotta get down on MONDAY!
Your line upon entering reminded me of the MLP/Moonbase Alpha video
...
Sketch: what is your opinion?
Can someone explain waht were even talking about
Or is it jsut random jibber jabber
yomom
Well I would do a bit of both
Sketchy if you do a ponified version of Ledger's Joker witht he "why so summer" lines Id...fedex you cookies
Im guessing jibber jabber
/me hits Pyroh with a pan
FRYING PAN POWER.
I mean, Sketchy there looks as I want him to, which is a bit like me but also some stylisation unique to him.
...
ow
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik Also this is what I'm referencing with my earlier line in case someone has somehow not seen this yet.
GUYS. OPINIONS, please?
How 'bout it sethy?
sketchy*
I could do it maybe.
SENTRY
/me walks in room drinking some water
~yay~
We'll see.
~woohoo you rock~
/me needs delivery falafel. that would be fantastic.
nevermind then.
But yeah, SummerRain: I'd say do a bit of both, as I said.
How are you gentlecolts?
oh
i didnt see it
Tavy!
All your friendship are belong to us!
I have to wave this link at you so you can appreciate the fact that I too have a musical mark.
why hello there
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Here we go.
Hey.
tenor? nice!
Actually that is an alto clef, dear.
what are you doing?
can I haz chezzburger?
Trying to make a game run in windowed mode.
Would anypony of you get a tattoo on your but with your cutie mark?
But you knew that of course.
well, they are the same
Hey are you the same Octavia from TF2?
/me does not play tf2.
Ohai Ziltoid
Oh goodness me you're right =o
Wrong Octavia then ._.
hi pegacorn
that a drawing you do sketchy?
Yes
/me smiles at Sketchy_Sounds.
looks good
That's a drawing of Sketchy in fact.
sorry that i assumed tenor.
ZOMG!
MUSIC NOTES!
/me was a diligent tenor sax player at one time in her life.
Well you are technically correct, Tavy: it's both an alto or a tenor when it's on the C4 line.
...C4?
And I suppose tenor would fit better considering what my voice is like, lolz.
/me KABOOOOOOOOOOM!
C4, not C-4.
/me smiles
How's it going Ziltoid?
Isnt it the same?
/me gives Octavia a cannon for her symphony
Nope. One is an octave range and the other is plastic explosive.
c4 is a bit quieter.
Good good you?
hello
Anyway yeah. It's a clef and a pencil to represent my two biggest passions i suppose you could call them; those being drawing and music.
I wonder if it would be possible to have an explosive orcestra
I like C-4 better :)
lol
I'm doing fine.I'm just at V-Rage levels of anger because of Rule 34.
C 4 is the octave scale in this case, not C4 the explosive
Oh what did you see?lol
/me smiles at Ghrathryn.
I like the louder one better
/me is still giving Octavia the cannons
/me smashes a table in half with his bare fronthoof and screams "ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH"
!flip
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me lands on her back. Ouch!
OCTAVIA!
/me jumps out of nowhere and hugs Octavia
o.o!
But yes, as you can see in that image, Sketchy is Celestia-tier lanky
Trust me,you don't wanna know.
Alright let me guess
Twist was in it?
I need a good fanfic to read, any sugestions?
/me lags out of control.
Progress, if you haven't.
Nope.
(brb)
Nope, can you link it?

You should be able to find it easily on EqD's fic links

Theres nothing better than to visit Equestria Daily after a hard day of work
/me has Pot Noodle
Well, there are massages...
...
And an Ice Cold nukacola.
!massage
13Well, it's actually called Snack Noodle
THE ONE THING I WANTED
This is why I can't have nice things
13a cheaper version apparently, but basically the same thing =w=
/me is hungry....
Cuz robots aren't programmed to give them?
13Go get food :P
:x
whats the topic?
/me has food.
/me wins
06and snack noodles are pretty nice o3o
That's an epic topic.
you shoot the fat?
Yes
06i can't o3o
why would you shoot the fat?
06not permitted too.... leaving in 2 hours
Cuz this town ain't big enough fer the two of us.
06i'm gonna leave for italy in 2 hours
im chewing MilkyWay right now
13Eat anyway, screw what anyone else says |D
13!espeon
Haha, the fanfic you gave me just cracked me up. xD
obviously
Then how is it in any way relevant?
Oh, okay.
/me has splatted in the middle of the chat. She's unconscious, but there seems to be no damage to her whatsoever.
i fear that Season 2 wont be as good as 1...
06if ima doing that, i'm going to be in touble ;.;
Luna episode in Season 2~
13Be a ninja about it
13no one will ever know~
Derpy's a speaking role now
If you give into that fear, then your mindset will prevent you from enjoying Season 2 just as much as season 1.
/me wants more luna
/me runs over to Mistipulate's side.
derpy we dpn
Well, you'll get more Luna.
Next season.
/me takes Mistipulate's wallet.
*derpy we don't know the specifics, hopefully she'll play a bigger role yes
/me runs off.
well
/me unintentionally trips spidersean3 and takes her bitpouch back.
i have heard that Lauren Faust wont be in charge in Season 2
(With MAGIC >:3)
That's true. But she's a consulting whatchamacalit.
/me smashes his face on the concrete.
So that's uh... something.
... I desherved dhat
i love something
somethings my favorite!
what
stop it
It won't get bad unless RANEBOE DASH AWLWAIZ DRESUZ IN STYUL
lol wut?
yes it will
why did Lauren Faust drop the job?
/me goes ninja-ing then
nice one
Hello again
/me spams RANEBOE DASH AWLWAIZ DRESUZ IN STYUL, much to RBD's expense
Maybe because she was focusing on a different project?
hey barry
06ima using my cap to hide a mars or two under >:D
heya
you missed dari clopping on stream
She's got that Galaxy Gurlz/Girls thing she's doing.
I'm glad
13asdf, soy sauce tastes really strong on its own |D
STEEEEEEEEEEEVEEE
.....
That's not something I want to see
I think MLP will still be good though
03LOL
Anyway, Power Rangers Samurai is a pretty good series
well, as long as she still helps writing the script
it should be fine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpjdd2Ga2u0
Every Power Rangers opening made
06back
06i smuggles sausages under my cap :3
Heck, as long as the ponies still go out and do questing stuffs, I'll be happy. What makes the show great in my eyes is that they don't live in this hedonistic paradise where a daily routine is makeup and rainbows. They actually live in a working town, and live in a working community and do working stuff in the show. More realistic, and easier to relate with IMO.
Agreed.
03wait what, why can't you eat
true
but still
06it's like 10:18PM here
i want great jokes
and awesome pinkie pie
And it has to have that charm
that too
^^ THAT
06got to be sober on food when leaving for italy, otherwise i can't sleep
It's not like Lauren Faust single handedly did everything for the show. -._-.
Pinkie is best poni
Don't worry, I'm sure season two will be every bit as good as season one. Though I hope I get less... "snooty" roles.
03o_O;
BLACK SNOOTY
12Are you going to Venice? It's nice there
06nope
Damnit, beat me to it.
06Lake garda
:)
;D
06to the north, Riva Del garda
I mean, she's great and all, for coming up with an excellent concept, but still. You need a team.
Of course you do.
Impossible to do it ALL by yourself.
12Oh wow I've been there when I went to Italy xD
it sucks so much that you cant visit two chats at the same time
yes it does..
And that team's stayed with the show, even if Lauren isn't at the forefront.
Does it count as a success if you, on Omegle, succedes in convincing random people to watch MLP:FiM?
yes
06i like it :3
06going to meet a TST member there too :D
12Yeah, it's awesome <3
12Oh nice, who? :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d06ccWORI5g&NR=1 Hahaha
Success is me then!
06Patrick Carnahan, he's from USA, Washington, now lives in southern Italy, napels
06he's a epic guy, well, on some moments :3c
12Oh yeah, well have fun you two :3
13Have fun in Italy :3
I trick people into thinking Equestria is Real. That is, non-fans of the show.
12Is it the first time you've met someone online?
bbl
03is it just a short vacation or something?
06yep
Turret Sparkle. Dear lord, Fandom. ._. U scary.
06yes, one week
03k
How are you guys?
06but ray is in the netherlands, for 1 to 2 years, surely gonna meet him more then once

12LOL!
LOL
I'd be interested in seeing Sea Ponies G4'd.
/me wipes off mouth, then whistles
13brb gonna complain to my dad
http://youtu.be/0XgKmyTg0Qc
GGgala, at least with Skitty and Wailord, they could have fertile offspring
Imagine if Fluttershy ended up with Pinkie Pie's personality
I imagine her face when: "Sweetie Derelle"
.....OH MY GOD DO WANT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So much chaos.
..
no
yeeeh she's starting to be become a tiny bit too assertive to be called FlutterShy anymore
YES!
Flutterpie
Pinkie Shy
But that's not the weirdest couple involving Wailord
I think the G1 episode made the whole "being someone else" thing too happy and stuff
Ninja-d
lol
meanwhile scootastare is watching from the bushes
god, remember when when ButterShy could barely say a line the whole freaking episode?
Fluttermina Diane...Cake
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSR76VHhII
yeah, that was the first episode
I love the reactions to some of these @Ponies
it's also funny since Fluttershy and Pinkie are voiced by the same person
And Rainbow Dash and Applejack are voiced by the same person also.
Are we talking about PinkieShy shipping?
13Well that was fun
No.
What is this?
so is Optimus Prime
13I asked my dad if he ate them, and he accused my mum
more about a personality merge
Hi Sotha
Hmm, who should Rarity swap personalities with if that idea becomes a season 2 episode
06xD
Ah
13and she said he was lying
hi barry
13D:
Optimus Pie
http://youtu.be/5zLJqaUDN_E
APPLEJACK.
howdy Sotha
Applejack or Rainbow Dash?
We're just having some fun
06i would do the s- erm..
06xD
Snips or Snails.
Applejack...oh, Rarity working on a farm.
Applejack
Rarity: I'm getting filthy, and I LOVE IT!
:D
12Blame them both
mainly because shes awesome
13It's ok though, I have seal bars instead
13Like penguin bars, but cheaper
she and AJ already had some big conflict
i say Twilight
I live 'em all
AJ is the best
que esta haciendo Dari?
and
13it's from Aldi, so it must be good .w.
Engineers: Doing science Aperture Science? is afraid to do.
Chikunnism
i want Pinkie with Twilights personality
I love 'em all equally
No pony is the BEST.
I think the G1 episode was Mish Mash Melee
Objection!
Rainbow Dash as Fluttershy?
Luna is the best!
In which 4 ponies had their personalities change
13Oh, let me correct that
06they have a aldi in the UK?
I'm trying to make a game run in windowed mode.
A Pony John Madden?
aeiou
13They're like penguin bars, but cheaper and don't have a joke on the back
and there was a song about how great it was to be somebody else
Who needs science when you have a sentry.
Yeah. It'd be interesting trying to see Twi try to comb her hair and have it puff back into chaotic curls.
06i though it was only in germany and the netherlands
oh dari did you say that software was called 'v8 screen capture' earlier? i think i misheard
Which one?
oo00oo what game?
VH
HA.
ah
13Nope, Aldi is here too :P
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
VH?
12What no joke?
Gunz, Dermathil and I were sicussing it earlier.
12What is this sin.
The VH was at GGgala.
13I know right :<
inb4 moonbase spam
MOONBASE!
12The things they do these days =<
And Pinkie Sparkle's hair would inexplicably curl into a puff. Holla holla get dolla.
Who would Twilight Sparkle swap personalities with I wonder...
Pinkie Pie
PINKIEEEEE
and the brain
Wasn't Fluttershy going to though?
thats boring
I know, what if everypony's personality changed to that of Pinkie Pie?
Fluttershy needs Spikes personality
Fluttersparkle?
I mean, Pinkie's got some unexplainable influence over the fabric of reality, right? If she became a unicorn... I fear for Equestria.
I'd love to watch Dari play LoL, so we could laugh at him :P
Oh thanks. :P
That would bring about the end of all days, Spectrum
who said they should just swap personalities, let's have them all shuffle personalities all over the place!
I've never played it before.
FullerDashPie SparklingRariti Jack
Great idea
to be fair, I'd laugh WHILE giving you advice :P
SUCCES
Luna and Celestia Swap.
personality shuffle
ELT, pony orgy...?

True, G4 is the most faithful to MLP's roots.
I found the 2-part and 1-part G1 episodes tolerable.
I'll probably stream this when Dermathil comes back.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bjkM_y-Wps&feature=related I prefer this crossing of memes
that's one hell of a booby trap
oh sure, we're not cool enough for the stream
indeeed
I see how it is
I still don't know which game this is. Did I miss something?
It's more that I didn't really think you guys wanted to see it anyway.

Oh.
:P
Next time I'll wait for you Lycan
Also woo.
Doctor Who.

:P
There's plenty of other awesome 80's metal songs to pretend-sing over a chat.
Like....
whoooooooooooooooooooooo are you?
Who who? Who who?
IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Why you so owl?
hey, does anyone on here play vindictus?
this is a longass intro...
aaand awkward silence
It's all the intros.
From 1963-2010.
:P
ah
I've got it!
You know how Pinkie Pie often sings?
Not as often as I'd like.
^ this
If an episode is made in season 2 in which the characters get a personality shuffle...
Enough to keep me awake at night
'Sup, Ray?
Will the character with Pinkie Pie's personality end up singing instead?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9IQ95iJlk&feature=player_embedded
Coordination of the Allocation of Services in Concurrence with the Relocation of the Patient
02Hiya Pat.
every doctor who theme?
Pinkie Pie: Do I really act that crazy?
wow, personality shuffle would be weird
13Raaaaaaaay
13:D
i think twilight would make the perfect pinkie swap
Yay for plots based on MLP G1
jah
Ooooooooooooh her she come~
02And nothing new, Just chillin' with my new Laptop.
02:3
02ANNNNGEEELLLL :3
cool
watch oout boy She'll chew you up~
Suddenly, impromptu musical number, courtesy of the reality bending pony.
She's a MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN EAATER!
/me trows a pillow at Angel "dodge!"
Explosion.
And here is every regeneration, from 1963-2010
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXCpY_3Sac8&feature=related
06Throwing a pillow on a pillow
06Fun
I wonder who would be the most hilarious with Pinkie's personality...
screw G1, also the villains in it where definately rented from HE-Man due to they ran out of money
twilight, obviously
Aaaaaanywwaaaaayyyyssss
/me grabs the pillow and throws it back
exact swap
I'm going to cry if I see Tennant turn into the horrible Matt Smith. :P
Rainbow Dash already has pinkie's personality
03LOL @ this idiot on Judge Judy
aka her own goofy personality
Twilight Sparkle: My tail's twitching!
matt smith isnt horrible
Here we go
I don't think he can act at all.
Transformers ROTF has the best action scene ever
Are we talking Tara Strong acting like Pinkie Pie?
I'm actually not a big fan of Dr. Who...*hides in shame*
/me attemps to deathbomb
just wanted to throw that into the chat
Do want.
And he's the most fugly person I've ever seen.
/me fails
:P
It includes Matt Smith
13:D
lawl
I've always wanted to watch it, but never had the chance.
ROTF?
yesssss
Ray Of the Force?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XctuVzwERe4
Rum of the Forbidden?
I mentioned the idea of the characters of G4 having their personalities mix around
Because of a G1 episoder
episode*
twilight get's pinkies, twilight to applejack, applejack to fluttershy, fluttershy to Pinkie
/me read that as "G1 spider"
dat intro
What about Rarity and Rainbow Dash?
well due to season 1 had pretty much a lot of clicheic storylines
>Newest intro
and Spike
>_>
though I love Red Dwarf :P
oh right
<_<
but their execution is what made up for it
i don't see why not ;)
rarity gets RD and dash gets rarity's
rarity cant fly
RARITY CANT FLY
last one was better
Rarity with Spike's personality
Rainbow Dash: Why am I dressing in style?
WELL APPLEJACK DOESNT HAVE A HORN
02D:
....
the retun if Narcisus
/me is hyper .-.
ELT
that would break the line
Cuz RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN ST*punched*
Ahh, Judge Judy... court cases that were determined to be dramatic enough to put on TV
It's already broken :D
/me runs
so... anyone here play vindictus
Hmm... *taps chin* ...Nah.
can you eat that?
bowties are cool
I think Rarity with Applejack's personality is funnier
They weren't cool before.
Now they're the most uncool thing in existence.
Before Matt Smith of course.
:P
A.J. already has her accent :D
lawl
Rarity doing a southern drawl would be funny, all in itself.
I still stand for Rarity with Spike's personality
RAAAGE!
fezes are cool
seeing Rarity as a texan rofl..
I don't think the voices would change
03yeah
They would just act differently
well we dont want to see rarity with a MIRROR FETISH
DAMN YOU OSAP ELIGIBILITY!
now do we
omg spoilers
I do! :)
I wonder what personality Spike should get?
RARITY'S!
02alllsoo
lol
HOW ABOUT HE ISNT INCLUDED
02got TF2 working smothly
These effects are amazing.
02anyone wants to play? :D
Tha's racists!
What if Fluttershy acted like Rainbow Dash?
03No.
Spike swaps personalities with Prince Blueblood. How's that for complicating a romantic interest?
lol
so..
oh yeah...
prince blueblood gets spikes personality
??
Apple Bloom and Rarity switch!
Celestia would send him to the moon
"Spike, take a letter."
GODE DARNIT I WANT SEASON TWO
And then chaos ensues.
What if Trixie gets involved in this?
:O
The Great and Powerful...
doc-t-c-t-uh
then everyone will have a mirror fetish
Derpy?
02drf's opinion is always invalid
XD
WHy isn't Prince Blueblood in the moon already anyway?
02anyone else? :P
The Great and Powerful Derpy?
trollestia, OBVIOUSLY
E'yup.
wut
03how is my opinion invalid
The Great and Power Full Trollestria!
13Baby spider on the desk >>; dunno what to do with it
03also, "no" is not an opinion, it's an answer to your question
7Oh, yay, Ray.
i love how Celestia basically told Twilight in the first Episode to stop nerding and get some friends
13That's what I'd normally do LOL
13I feel bad killing the smaller ones though .w.
/me 7pokes Espeon, not-here Rora, and not-here Feather.
xD
03I don't
7In response to Ray, 'course.
03why are you poking people who aren't here
What if Applejack ended up with Twilight's personality?
David Tennant for 12th Doctor.
is it normal that i'm whistling winter wrap up?
13Ok my computer is suddenly speaking German to me
suddenly becoming obsessed with books
well all i know is that TWILIGHT NEEDS PINKIE'S
02Quan, 1 vs 1? :P
02Since I suck atm
"My Faithfull Student Twilight, why dontcha leave those books for a sec and get a life hun"
7I'm not on my desktop. XD
13and the spider's vanished now, dunno where it went :<
exactly
7Try in one hour?
Trollestia strikes again
Having Pinkie in your head would probably make you explode
lol
ouch
rainbow
lol @ Spike getting prince blueblood's body... You know he'll be shooting for Rarity in a heart beat
03that's why you kill them when you see thoem LOL
and then you'd explode again?
03*them
dat 80s space weapon
Totally
thats the idea
That would be weird
Jennifer Saunders for 12th doctor
13I'll probably see it again in about a week's time, and it'll be a huge thing with long legs
the TARDIS made a sonic rainboom?
7Spiders are helpful. D:
13and just thinking about that made me shiver x_x
what if Spike gets Angels personality?
omg wookie
063>tf2 1v1
06what
06what about the TEAM part of Team Fortress?
/me runs
oh this is the movie
I wonder if they'll have spike hit on Rarity next season =X
i hope not
02sorry Xelispeon
02waay to used to CS 1.6 :P
He's doing some minnor hitting on her this season
I get the feeling Rarity would shoot him down sadly
06I'm kidding ~
Can Twilight use magic to turn Spike into a pony? *shot*
Woo
what
Here comes Tennant.
I ment actually ask her out type hitting on her
Until midnight
13!espeon
he did
7Well, TF2's gameplay is different.
but offscreen
remember
...
Oh YEAH
02I noticed\
7Did you try offline practice?
03CounterStrike is actually somewhat worth playing
he was mustach her a question
it was off-screen
13why is my computer picking up a German radio signal .w.
Ohai best Doctor.
06o.o
02of course Quan :P
how could i have forgotten
7Okay.
yeah
Who would get Derpy's personality?
06LOL yeah okay Counter Strike isn't addictive to some people as well, that's a good one
how couuuuld you?
03some people get addicted to anything
02^
06Of course
03but I haven't seen nearly as many people being addicted to it than TF2
I DONT WANT TO GO
7Placebos, a webcomic demonstrates.
02Me included, lol
/me gets addicted to riding roller coasters
>meta
/me is addicted to Espeon
lame last words though
/me runs
7O_o
7But lol, DRF, nah.
Ironic that Tennant chose to leave.
06guys n' girls
>last words
06leaving for italy now
I don't want to go.
am i the only one who loves the scene where Pinkie Pie interrogates Spike?
I'm THE BEAST OF ALL!
7It's as addictive as any other Valve game.
Oh God.
06tf2 just has a lot of replay value and a lot of "wow, cool new shiny item" moments. and that's AFTER the "WOW this is totally new" feeling of all the classes have passed :P
NOPNY's GONNA EVER KEEP ME DOWN!
06So yes, it is addictive
Look at that ugly thing.
13Have fun Cloudey! :3
/me dies
06see you all in about 12-13 hrs
With no acting skill.
>_>
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Comic: Doctor Whooves Series (http://tinyurl.com/4553tta)

06if anyone's addicted it's Feather
02seeya ~
WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
13THE SPIDER
Maybe someone could write a fanfic in which the characters of G4 get a personality shuffle?
13it went under the desk
13and I lost it again
XD
06She reached the amount of hours played I had in 3 months in like... 2 weeks LOL
umad dari? :P
13;w;
7A good 30 hours was from when Steam didn't realize I logged off. :P
Very.
now I know how to troll you during streams :P
03it doesn't count it as playtime if you aren't playing o.o
I totally would
7Exactly.
INB4 I instaban you. :P
03you can leave steam open all you want, just close the game
Just take consolation in the fact that he isn't forever.
haha
make one of Spike and Pince Blueblood switching minds
whats so appealing about fanfics...
03that being said EW LEAVING STEAM OPEN
7Hey, Steam glitched on that occasion.
03I do that and I basically get stuck with dialup speeds
hey, not that it isn't a bad thing, but how long has this Personality switch convo been going on? XD
filler till season two
03because Steam is a bandwidth wh0re
Anyone else will be a better Doctor for number 12.
hey, I've already gotten my first joke ban, I've gotta work to somewhere, right? :P
13Steam will always be water vapour in my mind and nothing more .w.
03^
02lol
crap
03I try to avoid obligations to Steam like the plague
03I prefer computer games that are standalone
i always exedentakowqdly leave the chat
02Hey angel. speaking of games...
03and can be played without needing a third-party DRM check
02Re-download TH9\
02xD
13I was expecting that LOL
/me decides to work on his drawing for today... would like to finish the second part
13and I don't feel motivated to do so right now
13which is what I said last time but
13yeah
13|D
03I love this commercial for home security
02when are you motivated then? xDDD
03it's so fun to make fun of
13That's a good question .w.
i mustach you a question
03Home security systems are completely useless
03as criminals can just disable them LOL
how is MLP animated?
the animation is so incredible smooth
A Dr. Whooves webcomic? I love this fandom.
flash
is it fake 2D?
03it's like that one WIN! picture I saw
03"This car is protected by this shiny anti-theft sticker"
And not even the most recent Flash, if what I've been told is correct...
yey I killed chat!
13LOL
Ô.o
how does Flash even work?
NOPE
03as that's about all
03er
Never understood that
03that's about all anti-theft is actually good for
It's an animating program.
i know
03is having a useless sticker in your window
but
why is it so smooth?
Play some funky music!
Frames, tweening, etc.
Lots of hard work.
white boi
you have a bunch of frames and you have objects that you move around between frames
I need some sad music now.
oh oh I know
It's the truth, sadly
10th Doctor dying. ;'(
/me watches Unsolved Mysteries
it'll only be sad if you've played the game
Having a staff of animators helps.
03Yep
Oh, guys, just so you know, Scott Pilgrim will invoke the Beyond the Impossible trope
and there's fancy stuff to make it easier, like tweening and object libraries and layers
so I'll ask
03how is it sad though?
have you played FFX?
IDK
Nope.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
03Home security is useless, since there are always ways around it
awww
great game
03locks only keep the honest people outl.
03-l
LOL
Love this video.
XD
03same with passwords on computers, etc
Ah. Object libraries. One thing comes to mind: MUTANT PONY DRAGON TOTEM POLE!
nice
oh celestia no
sexytime
"This sticker means that your car honks and flashes its lights when you break a window."
*spews random objects in all directions*
kk...
03the best solution is to just not keep valuable stuff in plain sight in your house LOL
I'm confused
03don't give people a reason to break in
I see a still image of twilight
Still?
meh, I still prefer to have passcodes for certain things
Oh no.
Pinkie Pie finds The Mask
;)
NOPE
no
Lycan? as in "Lycanthrope"?
computers, I don't have much valuable data to have stolen
Best.Crossover.EVER!
hmm
03just don't let people use things that are important to you.
03like your phone, etc
As in.
the stream isn't working for me then
the Mask would make her look normal in comparison
and it's not an easy thing to steal
at least my computer
interesting
03I mean, just don't let your laptop out of your sight
Exactly!
03and no need to have a password :P
because normal 2D drawn animation is never so smooth
I'm usually pretty good with that
03plus even if you do, you can just get a password cracker
It probably is.
and movement is extrapolated by programs so it is very smooth aswell, by animating movement mapped to a curve)
03not YOU per se, but someone
I'd love to see a Pinkie Pie version of Cuban Pete!
You just haven't noticed she's moving.
Not all theives are that smart
closer
some
and closer
03well
the really serious ones
Dem eyes
Also As in, The White Lycan, the blade of white, other extravagent titles, etc.
03some people just steal laptops to sell them
Dat smile
no, cause I'm watching it on the link ziltoid presented
03in which case who cares if you have a password
03you're never seeing that data again anyway
Twilight? Twilight what are you doing? No, Twilight NO! NOOOOOOOO!
at the same time that is
Pinkie Pie In Coco Bongo!
But Lycan or Ly is fine.
Now I see it, it's very slow
I could watch this all day.
03yeah, the average person would just sell it to someone :P
It makes it inconvenient for them
the stream's twilight is the same, whereas the sidebar is actually zooming
Very easy to miss at first
03not at all
Like most Italians here
03just reinstall Windows
hold on, imma refresh the page
03again, it's not going to get stolen if you aren't an idiot and leave your laptop somewhere where it can be stolen.
The eyes
My God the eyes!
there it goes
PIERCING RIGHT INTO MY SOUL
I don't put a passcode on my computer, though
PULSING EYES
oh noes
BRB
03so then what would a passcode be useful for :P
wait a second
wait
let's call 'im crai
I guess I should say, a passcode is an anti-data theft thing, not an anti-theft thing
Herpaderp.
true.
it doesn't help them from stealing your whatever
03exactly
damn
03and most people don't steal laptops with the intent of taking your data
03they do it to make money
i cant find the clip
03so who cares
it just provides a simple way to keep people from immediately getting into it
ah
here it is:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
more of a simple protective measure or a delay than a full on encryption thing
03doesn't mean they can't sell it to someone whjo can just wipe out your account.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
I finished watching season 1 yesterday. Confound these bronies, they drive me to join the herd!
Coco Bongo > NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But it's also a slight deterance
03the only things I've ever had stolen were things that I derped up and left lying around when I left the room, and someone walked up and swiped it
'Sup J?
03but that was also years ago, before I knew better LOL
MY LITTLE PONY! I'LL WATCH IT! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
hi guys
/me shouted at the top of his lungs in a public bar
What are your thoughts on http://www.injected.org/abstinence/?
abstinece?
NOPE
Back.
I left my phone on my bus one day by accident, and somebody probably got into my backpack when I wasn't looking and stole my graphing calculator
At a hay bar?
Hi, The_Si
/me then became a brony.
which the school let me borrow
It is a piece of satire.
Hi/
03LOL
Lol
/me or werebrony if one would prefer. >_>
03oh yeah, I lost a calculator once too
"Just say no to abstinence!"
03I think I left it behind in a class
and then they forced me to pay them back with another one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
03with my calculator, I have what I call an "annoyance screen", rather than a password
/me wonders if that implies that he turns into a brony under the full moon or not.
03every time you turn it on, it says that it's my property, and to please call me if it's found
my dad found a crappy one on ebay for $50 :P
/me loves the 3rd person.
No, they turn into bronies under a full Pinkie Pie.
xD
03so if someone steals it they'll get really annoyed with that stupid message XD
How would the ponies of Ponyville react to a werepony?
03the only way to get rid of that is to know how to use the Start-Up program
or maybe they'll be nice and return it
03and most random idiots won't
03exactly.
03it's worth a try, right?
which they haven't
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Yup
Either love and tolerance or extreme xenophobia.
03well I haven't had that calculator stolen :P
Also back. I was distracted by stuff.
Pinkie Pie: During the night, she's a normal pony of Ponyville
<mfw you play this again
Pinkie Pie: but when the sun rises, she turns into a hideous ape!
You reposted it.
I'll definitely replay it.
....
I did
LAWL
I'll replay it all day.
I wanna know how much sugar she consumes daily
03That's probably more useful [than password
03s
03is nag screens
03that just keep popping up that it's your property
Pinkie Pie: during the day the is normal Pinkie Pie
03eventually they'll be like ARGH and do something about it LL
03*LOL
what makes you think she consumes sugar?
find my iPhone app is good for that, although it's almost useless for my iPod since it's jailbroken and thus unteathered
sugar consumes HER
Pinkie Pie is obviously a plant, she produces sugar.
03I have the SeekDroid app
Pinkei Pie: During the Night she becomes the Ebodyment of the God of Mischief
And becomes
THE MASK!
ELT
xD
you arent funny
Nice name
cut it out
03yeah
I don't care
I like my Idea very much
If someone make a Rainbow Dash version I'll die.
03but my friend's friend did the most clever thing with his car
find iPhone, SeekDroid, locateBlackBerry
makes*
/me made up the last one
03he had a system set up so that if you don't press two certain buttons when turning on the car, it would wait about a minute or two and then drain all its fuel
Every so often I come back to this tab, and she's closer and closer and . . . [static]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VTx7K7PXg
I'm surprised Pinkie doesn't just secrete her own sugar through her pores.
03so that if someone tries to steal it, they'll wind up dead on the side of the road
03XD
So why not relax and enjoy yourself
03well, the vehicle will die, rather
Nice
03that's infinitely more useful than having a security system :P
that thing

It's no problem/.
so it should be in an hour.

How do you do links?
^_^
Pattyrick: the «welcome message» is known as the topic.
13Actually it's 22:34pm
Sotha,, like you just did
We need none of these references in Season 2.
also, half an hour*

Ah, ok

D'oh

dst makes it BST
I need to be in bed
I meant with the info thing next to it?
i agree
lol, ad
i was just joking
so I'll have to bring my iPod
/me runs
GMT is always UTC+0..
....It's like they took three things from my childhood and mashed them together in the most epic win way possible.
What do you mean Sotha?
however, i liked the 2001 reference in Season 1
13I don't know the difference LOL
oh nevermind.
but if the intended zone was BST, then..
It's of not matter.
Minnet: what's the time BST?
Lakorv: The time is currently 22:34:25 BST, Mon 2011-08-08.
What was that?
06and great, then someone will just have to say that I couldn't make it x3
Rarity with her Stone
Ok
13!espeon
Hmm, I never really saw that as the monolith.
Oh yeah, Italy is GMT+2
that'd mean the meeting started ~34 mins ago.
yes
I thought it was +1
the camera angle was exactly the same
I suppose it might have been, yeah
as in 2001
if that wasnt a reference, what is?
Italy currently observes CEST, which is UTC+2, yes
Well, I know the link worked, but when you scroll over the link box itself, it just gives the URL, rather than Title, Views, etc.
I was wondering there was a specific code for that or something.
Minnet: what's the time utc+2?
Lakorv: The time is currently 23:35:42 +2, Mon 2011-08-08.
that's correct
/me is a huge fan of 2001, read all the books
Oh snap, I forgot!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZnntFenRk
Yea
I know, Norway's got CEST too.
So did !
CET in wintertime.
Well... okay, yeah, all of them
You see, I have google chrome addon that makes ANY youtube link playable right there, so when I click, i can view the vid right here

there's a derpymail now? want
yea
There isn't a budget for that much rendering.
/me already belongs to you, silly :3

I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
exactly
It takes like 24 hours to render one frame.
i wanted robots, i got robots

damn good story and only at chapter 4
its impossible to include more
/me belongs to Espeon then? owo
LOLwhat, a commercial mentioned Chuck Norris
because its so goddamn expensive
Grade C: Slower than 52%. :(

even today, the Transformers are the most expensive CGI yet

7faster then 95% of NL lulz
i think we can be lucky that we got so much in dark of the moon
HEY
shut up
7nah left4
Rule of thumb: If your computer melts while rendering something for a movie, it's probably pretty expensive already
Quiet you!
Slower than 52% mean faster than 48% though.
So it's about average.
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS AN EXTRA IN TAHT MOVIE
he was
i believe you
transformers movies suck ass
I'm only faster than 63%. Dumb normal curve.

Would there be any way to make the EqD post bot include the link to the post itself?
Yeah.
Probably ... yea easily :P
12NO
I'll do it later.
12Ok... maybe
I think that might be useful.
Tab is the reason I sometimes kick/ban the wrong people.

06I have to go like, now sadly.
TABFAILS
or at least convenient, like microwaves.
Y U
Yes, they did try to keep it kid-friendly
6But maybe I'll give you a nice pic ^^
7Okay, Espy.
So as to click the title, and not a huge URL?
Wut?
Make your bot post the link
Yes. That's what I meant.
rather than separately next to the thtle have a URL
Dman is that even possible with IRC?

7Well, if the meeting passes, I'll be playing.
It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self — not merely a thing of one Space-Time continuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's whole unbounded sweep — the last, utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth have whispered of as YOG-SOTHOTH, and which has been a deity under other

Ziltoid is back?

6I basically don't get how or why the whole thing started..
12I'm glad you found it
02NS is missing... again =\
WTF is Gozer?
7just need to find a better USP...
Sathi, you should be able to stream bluray quality, but our internet probably couldn't handle it. XD
/me 7opens up google
6Attack has been made. ^^
Atleast it isn't RainBroDash.

Sorry about that, train was delayed
Ziltoid wanna do it right now?
Yes, a dark god war
sure
06So yeah, good nigh -.-
06t
Otherwise, not much
so i didnt
Anyway, everyone want to start now before you guys have to go?
Dman / Dealerwealer
D: Xeli
I think
Sure
ah
name
natta Espeon
06I have no choice sadly
06:)
Seeya then
Anyway
7I was wondering who this dealerwhealer was :P
name is 'Dario Montes Rodriguez'
I think there's a market for fridges with an interdimensional portal at the back.
Lol Sathi
Has everyone read what I said in the topic?
Maybe a clock on the door.
7had honestly no idea
tis my online name, I started Dman only for the brony thing
04o-o
Not lately
but now i use it a LOT more than dealerwealer aniways
lolwut Drake is here
7why that name? :)
04Yeah
04not for long though
I meant my first post, Pattyrick
7just curious
Because D is the 4th letter from A and W is the 4th letter from Z
The one about TST's stagnancy
WTF IS GOING ON IN HERE
That's why :P
Gozer is a ****ing H.P. Lovecraft ripoff. And a very cheap one at that.
I did read that, yes
I THOUGHT I CLEANSED THIS ROOM
(true story) (thought of this when I was like 8, and used dealerwealer ever since)
I hate it when people PM me with stupid questions
Because Del Boy?
:P
04Yes
Trololo
(till now with the brony fandom, i like Dman)
Interesting.
Alright, well, what do you think of it?
Your holy water has no affect on the power of the Great Old Ones.
random shut downs
Do you agree or disagree, and why?
Yyay
ARGH MY MOUSE IS SO DERP
Funny fact: There actually was an episode of the Ghost Busters cartoon that dealt with Cthulhu. And in it, Egon did say that Cthulhu made Gozer look like little Mary Sunshine.
Ziltoid u no find me yet?
7nicely found
oh man...what I wouldn't give to see Deus Ex streamed here one week
Fund it
hold on
okies
The only name I thought of when I was a child around that age that has stuck around is Severus Mortego Orchivald IV.
04I agree, mainly because I'm also one of the people either being hostile or indifferent to new people and someone who doesn't really try and make this a better place. I'm more just here for my friends.
Is that a film Val?
Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.
btw ziltoid my profile pic sucks i need to make some sorta awesome custom one
Prince - tis a game
06Well I guess I'll add my look on it even though I don't have that much time.
nah, tis like one of the greatest video games ever
Oh.
04But then, TST has nearly always been like this from my experience.
I have none
...
there's a particular meme associated with it, lemme find it
how do I find a website?
seems like we are talking about everything exept ponies
06We do not really need more to attract new members, but give them more incentive to stay.
7put on some music or ponyvid
7dari
ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH
My Little Cthulhu?
such is the way of the CHAT
It has, and there has always been an inner circle

Gozer is a weird Shub-Niggurath/Cthulhu/Yog-Sothoth inspired thing. Except it takes a human-like form.
Dat Charlie Sheen.
ok
Well, when I first came to TST, I stayed because someone said "Welcome to TST blah blah blah" in a forum games topic where I posted :p
dat trollface
A 200-foot tall marchmallow man?
time to find out..
I decided to stay because of that (that was idiotshadow btw)
No, the god/goddess thing.

dat scootaloo
dat video. nuff said
That and Pokémon discussion :P
What if we just linked a youtube playlist or something so that it can play in the background? Without the long pauses in streaming while people don't link new videos?

What is this?
E.V.E. trailer
02Game boards is like one of the only boards alive.
hiya :]
For example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4nAUPw8j5s&playnext=1&list=PL8BC7F9AC19E7781E
Xeli well
E.V.E. trailers make me want to play the game
how do I ask a question?
/me shoots Spread Gun!
E.V.E?
online mmorpg
You know one of the things that I don't like/tolerate is stupidity :p
Hellew
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAA!
the catch: One server. the world is the UNIVERSE
06Well there's a difference between stupidity and inexperience
One. Server.
I don't like MMORPGs that much.
How do I third-person? *Spiderman shrug*
But you should try
Yes
/me 7is back
oh...we're not doing that anymore

Anyway, back on topic
06But letting the newbies that are genuinely stupid make people assume newbies are stupid in general, don't make me find examples of individuals tainting entire communities / fandoms / whatevers
lol pegacorn, you only played it like 4 months ago :P
xD
/me prefers muffins
Ohai Sathi
7naxx 40 was awesome
06It's just wrong that is all
I was there
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Xeli, yes
yes
I only like MMORPG's for the opportunities for interaction with an established group of players in a more social context than most other online multiplayer games can provide without the use of clans or such things of the sort.
Thank you!!
/me glomps FluffyWuffs
I somehow manged to make the #AfterDark channel talk about FPSes
/me 7waves back to everyone
I WAS THERE.
It's weird
I'm back from work. Yay.
I think people just make assumptions
7welcome home
Ohai FreezeFrame.
I personally treat those who show a will to learn well and those who don't like hopeless noobs.
Personally, I prefer not to until I meet them
AD channel seems pretty queit right now
whats going on in the afterdark channel?
howdy Freezeframe
Not me
#EquestriaAfterDark
they just do porn there, dont they?
What Lakorv said :p
most of the time, yes
No, they're the same as here.
Just kind of watching guys
sometimes, it's pretty PG as well
They can just talk about porn also.
sometimes..
"Luna won't you cry for mee"
In some ways, this place is very close knit
07Hm..
yes
sometimes
:]
In my experience, it's mainly normal.
Oh hey there FreezeFrame, my local musicwhiz
Either way, I manage to completely change the topic
i would like to be able to use swear words in the PG chat
All the time.
So it's difficult for new people to find a place here
Agreed with Lakorv
07Luna is correct
07Also
Whenever I join the TF2 wiki IRC, we talk about philosophy.
So what did Dari think of my idea? Just for a background playlist to play in the background? And then it could be paused and resumed when people in the chat provided links to songs they actually want played?
13The primary reason that people come here in the first place is for the Pokemon discussion and such, then it kinda branches out from there. Nowadays I'm here for the community more than anything, the Pokemon side to it is justa bonus to me~
13But Pokemon discussion doesn't happen as often anymore
or videos they want played, I mean
Yeah, Luna, it's an "inner circle"
That's also the other thing
I'm the same way
Sure.
07Well, I remember TST has been very closely knit for a long time. However, I would like it to be a sanctuary, beyond providing Pokemon content.
07I admit
want link to playlists?
People come for the pokemon, but don't get it, like AE said
first it's the topic, then it's the friends.
pony philosophy...?
(they don't appear you gotta grab the last part of links into URL and stuff
07I've become part of someone who stays only for Lugia and Articuno, mainly.
i can imagine that the AD chat does not have as many people as we do?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/ponies-awarded-for-epic-hacking-fails.html
07I could change this...
07*should
I miss WoW vanilla...
I only really stay here for friends and some other things
Not usually this crowded, but it can be
It's mostly the community that compells me to stay here
CELESTIA WILL BITE THE DUST......Somehow.....
07mhm
time to find out?
07Well
07Some people may remember me as more involved than I have been. However, I know that popularity is gained through inclusion, so there's that as we've established.
7Indeed; I stayed for the community.
(lol sasuke)
06Unless a site is truly exceptional, the community is what keeps people there over time if you ask me.
Meh to WoW
^
07Something I notice though? To be honest
07There's a challenge I see here that I don't know how to tackle
i never read the rules
LOL
But I know you guys aren't stupid :p
say what you want about it, it used to be a really solid game
people will form cliques.
but i will keep that in mind
We're going to have fun
07that too but
With scieeeeeenceeeeeeee
Elements of Harmony Rainbow Blast vs Kamehameha!
...lol
which one wins?
btw
Bit, can I say 'crap' and get away with it?
07some say that there are those 'n00bs'; people who present themselves in an immature way, that is REALLY, REALLY ANNOYING. Usually, but not always
:D
Well, yes
07young users
I have the most fun when my friends are online, but I also have fun with everyone else who's there
ELT we know the answer
07and then there are older users
7I still love it
now that someone is talking about the Elements of Harmony
Ohgod.SAVE ME GOD!
7because of the friends I made
well I dont :<
06Of course, the trick is to not go like
awwwwwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
07how to make communication between those groups better?
........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Well, I think people don't know that "noob" and "newbie" are two different words
what pega? dis awesome
>loves this song
Rainbow Kamehameha of harmony
am i the only one that is creeped out when Twilight opens her glowing eyes?
07Indeed
Eh, I play City of Heroes for my MMO fix
07Well
06"oh the previous newbie was a noob, this one must be the same"
/me runs away
They're not the same thing and that's what I think people are assuming
are you sure?
lmao
I was too.
that just comes the **** out of nowwhere
human conditioning :p
they're equally powerful so they mix each other
AND SHIT GETS REAL.
MY EARS!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
yeah...my guild was pretty pissed when I left
06noob is the combination of denial to learn and change, and being new :P
06and yeah
07those people usually shoved into that category are younger users
There have been a couple of moment where I just think ponies is about to turn into the scariest thing
/me tuts
07and then the older aged people can get snappy
yeah
like
that one time
07how to ... change that?
Honestly, I'm not really a fan of much/any pony music like this.
Cupcakes!
Pinkie Pie
where
07Children will be children, obviously.
she looses it
/me hits x to counter attack
Cupcakes!
booooooo
no, not cupcakees
I just like the original pony songs from the show.
>:O
/me makes FluffyWuffs slaps himself
Party of One?
Scootaloo sucks at singing.
07I just think that whole thing, the way people present themselves, and the counterreactions creates a division.
/me staggers back
yessss
shes alright
that's my fave episode!
there's A and B, something needs changing, and A can't.. where's the unclear part?
7why did you left?
/me threw a pokeball
WUBWUB
mine too
My ears are full of blood.
Cata, hated the changes
Sad Pinkie is just so
(requesting
sadf
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW :'(
)
got sick of them constantly dumbing down the game
yeah, that too
It's the attitude of the community, which is incredibly hard to change unless they want it to change
07Lakorv I dont uderstand that sentence LOL can you re-tell it to me? XD
I dunno. Anything DBZ is just plain overpowered anyway you slice it...
07and yeah
not part 1 dbz
i mean DB
Can an HDMI cable connect the groups together?
I CAN DESTROY ENTIRE PLANETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you mean, over 9000?
07LOOOL
!!!!
7I wonder about this Pandarian thing
*runs*
yeah thats pretty powerfull
Unless everyone pursues a common go-
7sounds interesting though
looooool
well
whatninethousand!?
I quit wow when wotlk happened
Only Freeza and more powerful people can do that
7why?
07ah, the older ones
07yeh i understand Lakorv
eh,it sounds like exactly what it will be, another cash cow addition
fighting powah, 1 million!!!
My son,the Lich King.
blasphemy
Panderia? Come on, that's just a marketing ploy
was tired of it
I think by Android Saga, anyone can blow up earth. Even Yamcha.
Yeah
US dubs are so good
young ones', even. Silly apostrophe got astray.
I'm newish but not too new
Though super buu did whipe out all Earth life
!seen light
Even Chi Chi.
7Actually I loved wotlk
7as a huntress
Chichi?
my guild dieded
Light is racist.
l8r
i dont like DB
I'm willing to be more friendly
Chi Chi could blow up the earth twice
So yeah, unless we all decide to change in that way and become more accepting, nothing is going to change
Yes.I have MANY sons.
pshhhhhhht
07Mhm
Dishes don't wash themselves
07though
she cant even blow up a bulding
I had a lot of problems with wotlk, but the immense increase in story telling made it forgiveable
nya nya nya
Son.I am dissapoint
And I admire your ability to DIE!
07I remember as when I was a moderator, when people caused trouble, people didn't mind dealing with me, because I had a kind, but firm tone. The troublemakers were most frequently people who did not understand boundaries. Who has the patience to put up with that, though?
07Because I mean
ever noticed that DB looks like a disturbed smilie?
/vegeta
Lycan, You're already dead
Dman: Eenope
Not my thing really.
07people ARE self-serving in the sense that they include those they know they can count on from before.
you ought to start at the lower-most level; yourself. Ourselves.
@Ziltoid:What?
Lakorv, because you see the world differently once your change :p
aww..ok man
*nostalgic sigh* I remember my guild's first LK down...
And then Lycan was a zombie.
it was magical...
SAD FOR YOUUUUUU
07haha Lakorv WHERE IS THAT FROM ANYWYA
7Yes as it was for me
you*
7that vid!
/me appears out of nowhere and kicks Lycan
and we used a shotgun to put him down :3
07i've heard you quote that
07a few times
my guild disbanded :(
Light murdered criminals regardless of race.
Heh
sorry to hear that Ziltoid
That vid indeed
but he killed more Japs than anyone
I've started to tolerate more people but I won't hold back my opinion
07ah
he like dJaps better
but that was a long time ago
xD
To you guys at least
Meh, I really don't like how they changed the singing.
Or the song.
07not saying you should, but
/me is a robot ninja pirate zombie ghost vampire werewolf
07Hm
He just knew more.
07here's something
Lycan
I've started to hold back my opinion when talking to new people :p
I tolerate people pretty well
you're a wat.
yeah its too fast
Lycan that doesn't work
7also I like the storyline Goel is following
I have a high-risk factor of being stupid.
the vibrato sound really weird
you can't be a ninja and a pirate
I tolerate people pretty well as well, just not stupid people
a ghost cant be a robot
7I wonder what happends with Garrosh
no u ._.
13I tolerate people way too much .w.
the rule of cool was shattered the moment you mentined vampires
no u stfu.
yarly.
^
/me has an existential crisis
07When I was a moderator here, I had to deal with a lot of people who were very floofy and didnt understand the concept of boundaries always, and I was tried to be put into trouble a few times
vampires are no linger cool
I still love the original WWU, and original 20 songs, but I enjoy the remixes too
07I just wonder
I have the bragging rights of the Lich King being one of my sons.
I just fk off when I don't feel like being annoyed anymore.
I lost interest in the WoW story when they killed off anyone I had a decent interest in
longer*
vampires sparkle
07how to make people want to be more ... tactful
Twilight sparkle.
07when communicating outside their own group
07without
@ ELT: I try to think Soul Reaver when I think vampires.
well
07being too lenient?
I'm tactful, I just don't prefer to do it that way :p
Illidan was baws
Soul Reaver is awesome
07I know I had trouble with that
7I have all the books *innocent look*
07Mhm
MMOs - GRIND GRIND GRIND
When I think of vamps
And the other Blood Omen stuffs, myes.
best game eva
That's it
They're usually fun for the first couple of weeks for me.
lol umad dari?
7*goes off taking a picture*
Got to lvl 48 in one 30 hour play. then didn't play for the rest of the month
07Indeed, but we do have the rules as a guideline
when i think of vampires
:D
Then I just meh, and move on to something new.
i try to think of Hellsing
07BASICALLY
Guess what?You know who Deathwing is right?
don't even get me STARTED on the bullshit of making Kael evil
i think of marshmallo- i mean rarity
The way I moderate or not is entirely based off what I believe, coupled with the rules here
i hate animes
and mangas
07well, I'm talking about more people than just you though, I'm wondering how we can make the inclusion thing an appealing goal for everyone.
;v
07Mhm
well the hate you too
Yeah
Well,he's ANOTHER one of my sons.
they are too much child like..
Val Hellsing
all of the mare the same
Everyone believes in different things
Val kyrie
oh sheeeettt
*without the m
But the first step is to raise awareness
rockets.
I like an anime if it's decent enough. :/
07Yeah so it was for me also, I know my moderation style can be somewhat 'mothering' in a way
If you guys were stupid I wouldn't talk to you
its always the same formular
07Lakorv... LOL
AKA not 'tarded fillar for 200 episodes or something dumb like that.
;p
07that won't work here!
:P
lmao
Yeah.I'm BAWS.
"Special guy/girl with special power (maybe a demon) does special stuff*
well what have you watched read?
mostly in a special world

L.O.
Unedited song
You know what's funny?
07silly beep
Cowboi bebop lolz.
L.O. Silverscreen
50% of the community would be gone if that rule was in place
/me hides
Okay, no
no i dont
ohai silverscreen
you just described a lot of fiction in that one sentence
Everyone always treats Satan as the antagonist, but he punishes evil deeds.
Ohai Silverscreen
Donate $10 to help raise awareness for N00B prevention
:U
06more like some people rather
...that's not what you wanted?
12no
F.U.N.E.T.
not just manga/anime
lmao
ect etc
Yo, Silverscreen
Plorf, you speak wisdom
07Lakorv
11S.I.F.T.
I shall kiss your feet
07i love you~
He's allitle bit of news Silverscreen.I am BAWS.
07that is all.
/me kisses Plorf's feet
07^-^
11So am I
As in, prevent the use of the term and the state of mind that people are n00bs
But they smell D:
*alitle
T.4.1.
I like the smell :3
....
07yeah
Do you know WHY i'm BAWS?
Pegacorn is baws nao?
11I spent all day listening to Pinkie Pie songs in class.
Ew, FFXIV.
Pray tell, pegacorn
He likes punishing evil deeds, so he makes people do them.
Fair enough.
11Why are you boss, Pegacorn?
/me makes ew, gay face
I'm playing FFXI lol
God 'hired' Satan, nuff said
so.. this community
Well,both the Lich King AND Deathwing are my sons.
because he got jiggy with a dragon and a zombie
it's forum based, no?
I had a very interesting discussion on religion with my mom today.
the Bible sucks
hi silverscreen
^this
worst fiction book ever
slowpoke
Partially
^This again
This community is more IRC than forum imo
I don't want to start a big debate, though.
07Yeah
FFXI is alright. I'm mostly just jealous that I'll never play it.
as in, threaded, topic-based webforum?
Most of the regulars go on IRC
Pegacorn - who's the mother?
/me kills FluffyWuffs Sam Fisher Style
That's where most my bashing stems from.
Eh?
07Lol why did I ever leave the moderation team LOL I kinda want back on it.
11Who's streaming?
07OH WELL.
D:
he is both
/me is happy to still be here XD
frigging updates!
well
.....I don't remember.It was AGES ago.
But, I'm a big fan of Sam Fisher...
I'm a regular now :B
6Yep.
07(I know why I left by the way I'm just being a silly beep and whining for no purpose)
It's ironic
11Awesome.
yes it is
a forum means a place to discuss, so if you want people to change, put up a notice for further discussion.
07anyway XD back on topic
You're just too regular to be irregular ):
gsIS IT REALLY?
:P
ya rly
7Love this song
krly
Yeah, anyway xD
if it's the IRC part that's the main problem
surerly
Ke$haFangs? that's what I read it as
I'm irregular here
Sathi - i got a luna republic steam invite thingy. was it you? :P
Lakorv, the IRC holds most of the community
(I declined, but eh)
7nope
Lolk
gather more people for an informative meeting and make people realise.
You're high
somebrony sent it to me
if you are, what you bought, i want some
But the forums are also important because that's where most people start out :p
I once did a parody of my character Kersha dressed as Ke$ha, named it Ker$ha
It is part, but I see the forum as another big part
what is luna republic?
And I tried, it's kinda hard to find a suitable time
Where is Articuno anyway?
/me is now dead
^
13Ever since I started coming on IRC, I don't post on the forums nearly as much as I used to. I dunno if that's the same for anyone else, but I need to work on that ^^;
:v
Whats up with that Cupcakes meme???

Goooood
I might take an early night today
i stole these weed cupcakes from Pinkie's bedroom
School starts thursday though :(

07Hmn
07I'm thinking
And for the year or so I've used/known TST, I've always been on the IRC and rarely the forums
7but HOUSE!
6D:
i can see the muuuuuuusiiiiiiic
Well, one of the reasons why people use the shotubox
. . .WHAT
you were in Pinkies bedroom?
HOUSE STREAMAN TODAY?!?
Is because it's easy to watch it while posting
6We don't start till next month..
7Prince is downloading ;)
Is this true, Dari?
Pinkie has a bedroom?!?!
Lucky...
today?
07Would another competition help?
07mhm
Wow. I never knew the color blue could taste like that....
Final destination is a bad movie
what for?
:P
11Meh, I can do without House.
07I like the shoutbox o.O
I can get scared if I turn around and I didn't know someone was there. I have high nerves. And I regularly read fanfictions written by the most derelect the world has to offer us.
/me 11slaps Ziltoid.
11No.
6My sim has some type of pedobear in her inventory. o.o
YES
lol
What, you though she doesn't sleep?
6Indeed.. :P
11The sequels after 2 are bad.
13I suggested Pokemon tournaments, either via wifi or on PO
07but again, I'm only around because of one/two people xvx I need to change that, seriously
7kinda agree...
11The first two are genius.
inb4 joke kick :P
Doctor Who has .4% left to download.
:P
LOL NO
Srsly i'm getting mahself tired, will House be streamed today?
07since when was I ever this ... little involved?
13but we lack prizes
Yay
Then I'll start downloading House.
7woeiii
Well, I have no idea
ah so no viewing house today just yet?
Pinkie does not sleep
she waits
Probably not.
well I guess its alright in a dumb kinda way
(sathi, we don't all have over9000YBpms speeds :P)
11Now, I GO!
!link Shakespeare
Pinkie is pony Norris.
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
7GOODBYE!
07Well, I'd be willing to quip in with art. And a competition thing with writing/drawing sounds more easier to arrange due to not having to deal with timezones as much
7*waves*
I'm not good at prizes or anything :p
bye silver

IT WAS UNDER EEEEE

I'm like the off-screen lurker here.

12oooo
07If it WOULD help the community, I could offer up something art-related, but only if there is no other - as that, a full-piece thing, takes me forever and a day. I
Sathi - always a repost time :P
07Mhm
I'm a regular, but I'll be quite if the conversation drifts away from something I can contribute to, or just gets too silly.
07swiss
07o3o
07LOL
I mean, I just joined yesterday.
07I love that word
7actually new ones
But I haven't gotten around to organizing it

Hey dari, there's now Pony Champloo too :3
haha
Want.
S'goin on everypony
We streamed that already I think Dman.
Well I'm a nice person :D
o lol k
13I think Aurora said she'd be willing to do art prizes too
(i just got back)
07and Lakorv, I believe I lost my community involvement when ... stuff happened. Vague, but it's past stuff I don't want to go into publicly.
07Mhm
new ones? do want
. . .
Oh that reminds me. I have like a full day's worth of content to catch up to on EqD.
what is this godtier video i am viewing?
Skylands, tempting, but nah
oh god
13I would too, but I honestly know I'm really unreliable with art and I'd only end up feeling terrible for never meeting deadlines .w.
I think the worst thing I've ever done here is having drawn human!ponies.
CUPCAKES
stuff happens. Every day.
SO SWEET AND TASTY
Sotha - celestiaspeed, brony
"Trixie is indifferent to Twilight's music"
07Lol Lakorv, as i said, I dont want to go into it here

07to span a much larger audience
We could redo that :p
Has anyone here not yet seen my drawing of Sketchy who wants to?
/me was eating while freefalling,LIKE A BAWS.
Wlah´s fimfiction does
It's more difficult with a larger group to do something like that
um . . .what? Dman ?
07we need to find out how do do that and make it interesting for most
o
And well, I lurk in really random places
o____i
I'd like to see the pony with the tricky cutie mark
Sotha that cat is all 'y so srs' :3
12^ what that guy said
Pegacorn u fallen yet?

Trivia Night, anything else?
Though it makes it easier that they have a radio to do so, but if you could find a simple game, like trivia or just something that's easy for new people to join into, it would be good
YES PRINCE I LOVE YOU KEEP DEM BRIT ADS COMING :3

The community event thing is pretty good idea :p

When you're new, you feel like the "Omega" and you want to have approval from the mods
I'LL BE YOUR DOG
So guys

HOLY GODDAMN!A BLACK KID?NONSENSE!

Aye?
Look at me, still talking when there's science to do!
07I was scared of arti when I first joined
I can play Winter Wrap Up on my guitar now more or less.

07then i got to know her and felt safer.
Glad I'm not you.
Yeah Luna

I can play winter wrap up on my VOICE. Biach
Lawl.
It's four chords. XD
Nope
07LOL
MFW rant about something that's not in any way racist

07I kind of admit doing that, but I also told her and was honest
VOCAL chords
...don't take that wrongly
12Better than Twilight Sparkle
07Nono
I have zero musical talent that I know of.
Everyone: this is hugely popular and every brit knows this advert (/ these adverts)
well
Noooooo
And yeah, I used to do that
Never really tried my hand at music.
07I've done it, too - mainly for the art in the beginning, but later
all this just for 'comparethemarket.com'
but now I"m an arrogant and cocky bastard
07I felt I genuinely wanted to be her friend
"Screamer of creepy apple bloom" what?
07Heh
Luna game does not ruin my second favorite character
so that doesn't apply anymore :D
07I like arti
07she's lovely.
I have played the violin before. I had no rhythm.
Luna?
siimplez
yo dawg, i heard you like geico...
She's changed from a year ago
no
PINKIEEEE
Sweetie Belle?

I'll make sure to suggest Pinkie Pie be included in the next one
omaga dari - that advert with erryone crying cuz they cooked bread wrong
I didn't expect that but I should have
Wait a minute
people change. S'life for ya.
07She's a very reasonable, straightforward person with a lot of compassion and competence/drive to act.
"don't worry son"
Pinkie Pie was in, like, the FIRST one, wasn't she!?
Pretty much
See thing for me is I've noticed
"thank you most kindly madam"
Psycho!Pinkie is almost canon though thanks to Party of One
Nah
I remember really admiring how she looked
Arti's pretty awesome now anyway :p
yes she was
07mhm
It's the flip side.
:P
but shes not cutting anyone open
The more I watch the shows and also the more fics and other stuff I read, the more I find to like about all the ponies.
AVAST
12o-o
AVAST!
/me is now looking for other british ads
I decline to believe that what happened in Party of One will be a regular thing with Pinkie
Emotional breakdown.
It was Creepy Apple Bloom or Zalgo Pinkie for the first one.
07I'm just saying, I hope we continue having including moderators; I don't really fancy having a large gap between mods/admins and the rest of the userbase.
She's a little unstable.
FLUTTERSHY'S ASS?
CONFUUUUUUUSED DOT COM!

Applejack was an instant hit for me
7hmm so far all images work here..(chrome)

yea sathi always working for me
07I know my strength is inclusion, and my weakness is that I sometimes act too quickly and when that happens I lack perspective.
can you call that an accent?
i guess not
also sathi apparently vid links make a link appear on the right?
Applejack and Dash are at the bottom of me list right now.
/me favorite is Fluttershy in Luna! followed by Bigmac
You totally can call it an accent because it is.
07anyway
wheat worms?!
for me i have the youtube vid embedded on right when i click vid link
07I want to go to bed
ValtheJean, are ya gonna be there for #Ponies&Dragons?
Well yeah, you have to acknowledge your weaknesses and learn how to cover them in order to become a good leader :p
It is... but it's fake. I don't like it when VAs fake an accent
is it cuz of an addon?

I would like to see some cookie crips :£
10Thanks

So it's called "shuttling"
thanks for coming :p
If you actually want to know, "shipping" is short hand for relationshipping, as in, putting two characters together.
and holy crap
I don't get the whole obsession with shipping either.
actually not that desperate for them

Haha, stella artois adverts.
I'm not big on fanfics and shipping, but I understand it.
or something
Anyway, does anyone else have any input?
Shipping is a story of a relationSHIP between two characters. As writing such a story is a verb, we describe the act as a verb.

Anyway
Shipping isn't always bad
but often is

10I wonder if adveristing PO in my forum sig would help
dat door
Well, any other ideas and such besides the ones we've mentioned?
10-t
Hah, that Snails comic is epic
/me hooves it
Heh well, the issue with PO is the downloading
/me steals the first comment, in order to stop some retard going "First!"
Dat bath
12Love that part
/me also complains about the file size and updates
12lol Skylands
pedophile in a van alert...
LOL
I tested challenge cup yesterday
I just remembered an advert.
OWL!!

The Walls Balls one.
GET IN HERE!!!

True dat ValtheJean
Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )

Thank you.
OMG DUEL

What exactly happened?
Your sick
. . .
was the Owl in that one episode was intentionally made so creepy?
12it's hard to say
I nearly died when she first turned her head around
eat our candy bar or you will DIE
just now
6My child is a toothpick. ._.
WALLS BALLS
He's a he.
This advert.
DARI I LOVE YOUUUUU
XD
Duel,the movie by Spielberg,about a truck that wants to kill this red car.
ALright, anyway
a he?
And yes, probably meant to be creepy.
in MLP?
Yeah.
WUAAAAULZ BUAAAAAAULZ
Te-he.
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQx6MZFS2n8&feature=channel_video_title
woooow....
Anyway
NOMNOMNOM
NO NO NO NO NO
12OH MY F GOD
Skylands, PO, as I said, requires downloading
BAWLS.
Ask Nightmare moon isn't a new one...
Twilight only wants male assistants, don't you know?
Which annoys people out of using it
I saw it yesterday!
10Yes
dat Pavlovian reaction
OH GOD THIS AD . MY FACE IS ACTUALLY XD RIGHT NOW
kid wants his balls
delicious balls
oh yeah
The server used to be public and we used to have a lot more people
Spike is a he too
10While WiFi is a problem for others, like me
hmm
but they don't count because they were trolls, fgts and idiots
"Oh yeah!"
There are more than a few creepy moments in the show.
trying to remember other british ads now
*Twilight's eyes turn white*
WALS
12which was why i made ho-oh realm's PO server private
Vauwls Bawls.
woof
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
FOOOOORREEEEEEEEVVVEEEEEEEEEEERR!
these moments are among my favorites
yeah
I love this advert.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
omg
dat dog
OM
that gets me every time
Twilights glowing eyes
12i predicted that situation
>makes human his bitch in 40 seconds
6WTF DUUDE
Lole spice ad suggested
Dat dog is a dominatrik.
12;P
Yeah, but that was ages ago
I started my friend on ponies with ... that episode. Oh yeah, Green Isn't Your Color!
12i know
At least 6 months
dat attack
Pinkie Pie freaked him out, apparently.
DOMINATING!
12just saying
12XD
Lawl
That's a good one to pick, I think
DOG IS SPY!
LOOK CAT
Probably even a year, I lost track of time
Dat dog flying
12i knew that would happen eventually
And yeah
oman
He's a lolicon.
BALL!
I like having it public because it has more activity
Wait...
what was your first Pony Episode??
Anyway
/me decides not to google that
>_< can't think of brit ads but thers so many more i forgot
12and i liked having it private
WALLS BALLS IS SPY!
Mine? Episode 11.
*1
7Suinide, if you ever insult Optimus again I will hunt you down, cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails. Due to the nature of this injury YOU WILL NEVER STOP EATING
My friend first showed me, uh...
1&2
The Muffin Holocaust of Derpy Hooves.
mine was 3
Mine also episode 1
This advert I don't understand.
I don't remember.
12so it'd be more community based and less just random strollers
Private gives a sense of a closer community
But whatever. XD
dat cadbury
because i was like: Normally the first two arent that good, 3 always get stuff going
Episode 1 & 2: "GO DOWN, MOON!"
I wanted to start from Ep1, but he went otherwise
so i started with 3
dat invisible man
and guess what, i was right!
1 and 2 arent that good
Nope
3 was meh
i have no legs and i must dance
it's cadbury i aint gonna explain chocolate!
of course
but it was a good episode to start with
I have no mouth and i must scream.
1&2 were funny, but not indicative of how the rest of theshow was gonnna be.
Pegacorn EEYUP
because its not as girly as some of the moments in 1 and 2
1 & 2 were ANIME
??
Suppose it was, it had good gags and all the characters were given time to shine
Yeah
Episode 3, I mean
will make you glee
i'm sure
Three was apparently one of the better ones to lead in with
Woo! Woo!
Thank GOD i'm a nerd,or else i would have NO idea what you were referencing GGgala.
Lol cute
yeah
10So about the same
And there was the one time when the main PO server crashed and everyone came to ours XD
Hey nonUKers, do you have '118 118'?
Oh God no, that word (glee) is forever ruined for me.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

Marmite: You either love it or hate it.
Veronica McDonald?
12Skylands
12whenever the official PO server came down
Un fortunately, it didn't have DASHIE!!!!! >:O In it.
12people would migrate over to ho-oh realms

You found it on there.
7Fear or fuhthrear?

Anyway,

http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-GIRLS-MY-LITTLE-PONY-CANTERLOT-PURPLE-T-SHIRT-5T-/170677736080?pt=US_Baby_Toddler_Girls_Clothing&hash=item27bd2f9290
Yeah
want was that?
I saw a teaser for FiM and as my friend was a pony, I thought I would watch it.
Mister Bean is BAWS.
My internet is so derp right now.
I'm looking for a rating, opinions on design
We hosted it on Alt's connection which is 30mbps
I was introduced to ponies by my brother, who had been yapping about it on Facebook. So I checked it out. That's why I saw nothing before watching Episode 1.
pegacorn dari - you excite for johnny english 2?
6Put taken on your YT? o.o
lol hi
EEYUP
I was impressed by the show even with the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
hey
12yes~
12yeah

(Airplane!)
I probably wouldn't watch it if my friend didn't make me.
But I don't regret it at all.
Johnny English 2??

Oh, actually, I saw a little bit of Wiinter Wrap Up on TV first.
Heya :p

Leslie Neilson makes any movie an A-Movie.

second, Budget	$3,500,000 (est.) Box office	$83,453,539
It is as hilarious as Bruce Campbell movies!!!!

/me finishes examining the stats
Anyway, I think that's the end of the meeting
Sketchy, How are they?
^
/me saves logs
I think probably either.
Am I still in 5?
Celestia is too pink.
/me is now undead
I came in a week or so before after the barrel first airred
guess it would
"She is TOO pink!"
Dman: seems like shit hit the fan. (cue a pile of dung hitting a real fan)
Yes
Also I got a mention
*"She IS TOO pink!"
lol
two message boards I frequent were both hit with large pony topics lol
2 pink?
:D
that'S the kind of jokes in that movie.
(As in, the argument for "Is Not")
My link to my pony sketch is #5 in the top 20 latest URLs.

I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue
But seriously,can somepony get some nurse pony in here so we can be healed?
6Anyways..I must go..I'll see you all tomorrow maybe..

I picked the wrong day to stop doing methenphetemines
If they would release a show accurate Celestia bronies would buy it in droves.

awesome cigar
/me cries
Ohh, I remember what you mean.
Kersha, I plan to fix the Tiwlight image, and probably won't even include the text
Someone linked a pic and I opened it on stream.
the text would be hard and repetative and not worth it.
hahaha
the only thing that's worse than pony r34/shipping is when it's Caramel related
... Hm... I would then.
LOL
HAHAHAH
I plan to probably steal a Twilight Image from the show.

And the MLB pony shirt that Plorf mentioned.
LOL
If you want to talk then join in.
Azuri, you're fine-- you can talk, how about jump into a conversation, or ask a question?
maybe you should try naming yourself Fluttershy azuri
one with "Brony Pride", one with a MLP version of Major League Baseball logo ( MLB ) with 20% cooler on the back
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgOodQnFS4&feature=player_embedded
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"My little black?"
and the last one says "MY Little Ponyta"
I don't have anything to do with MLB
Ah.
Hmm... Should I start reading Fallout: Equestria?
I always think of it as the MLG logo

lol
I go in there
12i saw a strategy online
7then I realised nobody knows morse code
how does that even work?
Well if the EqD RP is boring you should say that, not that just RP is boring ;p
You arent a true brony
It's text-walls about one pony
12for peeling them where you just remove the top and bottom
unless youv rp'ed
lol
I know a morsel of Morse code.
Pyroh
Going into a store like some kind of stalker and then he knocks someehting over
EqD rp IS boring
A strategy for peeling eggs? :P
7and in a few more years there will be wireless internet EVERYWHERE
12yes
Yes my good sir?
And they're all like, "Oh, it's okayu!"
I would love to RP but as a little side fun. I kinda stopped when it was all my friend wanted to do. Any talking turned into an RP. That got old quickly.
oo
7even the middle of the arctic
Another Sketch
12and you just blow through one end and the egg is supposed to come out the other
7technically called the north pole
I WANT NUCLEAR TO BE HERE

Then the knocking stuff over satlker pony started playing on the turntables.
12find and dandy if you are making them for yourself but if you are making them for someone else they might not respect that XD
There's a pole there? They could just transmit wifi from up there, then.
The chat is always more frantic with him here

Oh man, /b/ is a scary place for anything.

Sun is funniest one IMO. every article is written with complete bias without trying to cover it up anomre
Media is full of bullshit.

/me perks her ears up, "Yes?"
most awesome trixie yet
Not like your dark and gloomy backround
And wait, I focused my eyes. I see 8 now
For your poor little eyes
9OVA SUKIRUU
my background has one of Arty's lugia on it
14way for unoriginality
/me glomps Octavia
that is indeed the most awesome trixie yet
Turn your monitor down if it's too bright ;D
/me ooohs.
14oh wait
I like her vivi hat
What would happen if pinocchio said"my nose will grow now"?
14we can put pictures?
/me glomps Sketchy_Sounds.
14I didn't know that |D
yes
right click the channel
in the box
He's burst into flames and die.
He'd*
Greseres: he would become a real boy
/me is glomped
and its under background
14k
press select
...
my head almost exploede because of that question
http://youtu.be/Jwccqhc8_5o
i think that pentagram is from bible black....
>.>;;;;
the pentagram in that pic...
I think its just a pentagram
Blargle
It is a ritualistic pentagram
I'm awfully tempted to break one of the cardinal rules of good fic writing
14hmm
>mfw incoming chatlag
which is?
14how do you make it bigger lol
which is?
lulz
03that's what she said
13LOL
Use a pump
.v.
Shipping an OC with a MC.
Well
What are those things?
14lol shutup k
Oh why not go ahead
Actually I suppose it wouldn't be a main character
9enemies from the Eureka 7 movie
shutdown -k
I will enjoy all the delicous lulz
Not a command ;.;
But still technically an existing one
Oh, never heard of it.
/me doesn't see why that is so bad
>good
>fic
Pic one
03LOL
/me cackles
*Pick
There is good fic and there is bad fic!
good
All fics are inherently bad by their own nature
I'm not generally for ships, but if your gonna hook up an OC with a popular character you're probably gonna get negative feed back lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYX1HzRiIpM
My favriot inanimate object is Knives. Knives and Gunblades
hello
Wait Actually Knives,gunblades, and sythes
see the video
>sythes
I so want to buy a model of Squall's gunblade
Scythes?
I guess if you really did a good job devoluping the OC first and slowly suggested/hinted a love interest it'll get better feed back if you don't rush it
Indeed.
What does the tag "OC {onies
Original Creation
*OC ponies mean?
oh
Original Character
original creation
...
or Character
yeah, that!
Or that
cool
people would probably complain if you just made them friends probably >_>
Whereas MC would be Main Character
I'l be back
My laptop's rockin mlp. :P http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/IMG_1843.jpg
Mane Character*
Ha, yes. XD
03hm
Original Creature
03LL got one of those fake viruses
So anyone here read Fallout:Equestia?
03but all she has is IE and it blocks IE :/
MC = Main Character, SC = Support Character, BC = Background Character
03how do I help her x.x
might as well do them all
*instant pic of Slendermane*
*Mane
. _ .
I suppose in this case it would be an OC and a BC.
I've seen bits and pieces of the show.
/me doesnt read fanfics
Skipsy: but it is so unusable with all that stuff on it
It's a romantic anime.
13MSN has some kind of mini browser-type thing
7Eh?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ2q9NmYf6g
/me doesn't read fanfics because schoooooooool.
/me shrugs
This is creepy.
03EW THE NEW MSN
13use that to download another browser
7'Fake' as in fake program?
13xD
hook up Derpy hooves and a pony made out of muffins >_>
03Yes
lol
o lawd
03The thing that goes "You have 70 infections"
muffins suddenly disappear
7It blocks only IE?
03but it itself is the virus
03Well
/me is best bc pony. nope, no modesty.
7Antivirus?
9it's actually meant to be a coming of age story, but yeah
But only Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash stickers are stuck to my laptop right now. :p
9SUDDENLY SUPER SAIYAN
03I assume she doesn't have antivirus
03plus, those fake viruses are pretty nasty
Dash= best pony
Romance and Giant Robots, huh? Sounds like a match made in heaven.
your definitely of the most tallented BC's Octavia lol
03they can take over most antiviruses
7What's it called?
yeah.
^.^
03No idea.
Octavia is best BC, MC, PC and Mac ever.
back
But... you can't easily remove stickers D:
http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/IMG_1842.jpg
Well yeah.
/me laughs
03the problem is, if she runs TeamViewer I can help her get rid of it, but that requires a browser to run...
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a Coming of Age story btw.
7Well, it would help to figure out what it is. :P
Chicks did giant robots. It's a scientifically proven fact.
SUPER SAIYAN ROBOTS? I WANT!
03Who cares? It's a fake virus
I scanned the stickers and made backups. :P
/me clearly loves Octavia as much as he loves Derpy.
03which means Malwarebytes should help
Gorramit, you beat me to it.
DAT DYNAMIC KILL
And... they gave me sticker transfer inkjet paper. xD
9it also aired as a kid's show in Japan
9so yeah
Sometimes
I can't imagine having bumper stickers that aren't magnets
When a guitar pony shows up I demand he be named Chord
I don't ahve any stickers on my comp
9(GL, I mean)
eeyup
I like Derpy for best BC though, I tend to like the cute ones
Because they make a mess when you remove them
People ask why I used pinecones as a weapon.
12hmm
Sometimes
Which is why Luna and Fluttershy are my favorite characters
i dreaaaam about cheeeeeese
Well they have pines on theme
By the way, what are BCs and MCs?
I simply not-smile at them and say "Because they won't let me use knives."
9suddenly Tzusuku Sekai
MC = Mane Character
>mfw TTGL is the japanese equivalent of a Saturday Morning Cartoon
BC = Background Character
Main!
lycan: I lol'd muchly
MOOFINS!
the word is main
EEYUP
O_O I know my caffeine.
Mane is a pony joke
POOTIS!
what is this.. main thing?
eitherway
7Well, the thing is, my parents got one of those fake antivirus programs on their laptop.
POOTIS
*badum tch*
*eyes fall out*
7It happened to block almost all foreign .exe processes.
eww
Derpy what happened to your daughter?
Pootis cannot escape my mind.
SIMON!!!
03yep.
GOOOOO
About half my cerebral cortex is just POOTIS right now
>mfw NIA
Trixie casts magic missile!
needa dispencer here! needa dispencer here! needa dispencer here!
>mfw Yoko's M tank
/me builds more pylons. brb.
7I ended up restarting the computer, opening up task manager, and deleting the virus's process before it could begin.
/me is erectin' a dispencer
But yeah, for some reason some rogue part of my mind is toying with the idea of shipping Sketchy Sounds and Octavia. Probably due to the shared interest in music thing. Hopefully the rational part of my mind will figure out why that's a bad idea and convince that rogue part in due course.
Trixie takes off her mage hat and cape
03hm.
Dispenser*
THERE
7Then I edited the startup console or whatever it's called and unchecked it from starting up at the start.
Saps*
mobile dispencer!
/me runs abooot
If I had a list it would go Berry>Octavia>Trixie>Lyra>Rarity>Derpy
Stabs*
7There's an easier way of fixing it, though.
No love for me?
I see staps
Berry?
03how I fixed it for my sisters was putting Malwarebytes on a flash drive, and then I renamed mbam.exe to something like viruskill.exe since mbam was blocked
I love drunks and dramatic types
7Rename your .exe to whatever the virus's name is.
too late, I already running now
that's not how you spell Octavia
03hm
It wasn't a typo.
hihi bonbon!
linux liveboot, murder virus, ???, PROFIT
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Losing Ground (http://tinyurl.com/3zm244x)
/me giggles, "Berry is a sweet girl."
/me 9's random trivia: that song was Tzusuku Sekai, Gurren-hen's closing theme
My reaction to Celestia Radio right now:
what is this I don't even
Oh great
BonBon is back.
Whats going on right now
wait, what song?
Octavia & Derpy > ALL PONIES.
I had to rewatch that, lycan. This is such a stereotypical thing to say, but I'll say it anyway: How much drugs were consumed in the making of that video? I was waiting for hunter s thompson to drive thru
03well
9the one that played when Simon srs'd the fuck up
03the problem ll HAS
03*LL has
03she only has one computer
I flirted with Berry once
oh right
There's a TF2/Pony IRC, but it has really low population.
03no way to download anything without that computer...
/me puts on sunglasses "haters gonna hate"
She's cute.
7Hmm.
03I'm trying to see if she has a USB cable for her tablet
Ask Jim Davis.
the one I didn'T think of concentrating on when it played.
Fk me.
Good to know that there are plenty of fans of both
well, I don't know of any commands on windows that's like linux's wget
03since that can download teamviewer.exe and at least let me get in and fool around
/me rudely chucks a pinecone at BonBon's eye.
03hm
03well
7You could offer her my method. :P
7As klugy it is.
/me sidesteps, then rasberrys
i really love having all the episodes on my dvr but if i have to hear these cars2 commercials one more time i may sell my tv.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TGrep3PDAs&feature=related
This one is epic though.
GIGA DURILLU BREAKKKA!!!

Scrambled word is "utyutirf". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
7!guess futurity
/me grabs a piano
!hint3
Anyway. If I can't convince myself not to, perhaps some writing or drawing will come of it. *Shrug*
+__+
ZILTOID
I have all the episodes on my laptop and PC, waiting for dvd/bluray to come out
GET IN #P&D NOW
Sorry if I am unresponsive... mostly focused on #EquestrainStudy...
we be waiting for you
even then though I'll probably keep the episodes, they're good for references in drawing
oh lol
I lost my logs ):
/me starts playing Promise (Reprise) from the Silent hill 2 soundtrack
im using my laptop for work at the moment, else i have them all commercial free 1080p
9huh, seems they managed to get unlimited viewers on Livestream
7:O
/me Silent Hill? I'm listening to Feed Me
9slightly jelly
03she's on her tablet
You have the pastebin link?
03I'm having her download TeamViewer to see if we can get that working
Well
I have all the episodes in both formats :D
7http://pastebay.com/134855

[ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2LPADIu28A ] this is Feed Me
obv
9or they got validated for some reason
9also
9>we have giant robots, why can't we be more popular ;___;
Thanks
Mmm... I like me some Akira Yamaoka.
7Welcome.
Men digs ponies, scientifically proven.
I think I may have over did it with the gusts of wind that is gathering around Twilight as she is casting her spell in my drawing... -_-
9but
hai
NO IFS OR BUTTS
9real men dig Giant Robots AND Ponies
think this is the most complicated picture I've ever done lol... just means I need to push harder lol
PHOTON BEAMMU!!!
9they also let their friends with giant robots ride their horse-bot
WAIT
Mazinger Z...
Hrm
What if, like there was a Giant Robot, that rode a Giant Pinkie Pie into battle?
9like so http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HT_UTNt-AE
Heya LL :<
hiya x.x
¨>mfw NEW BOT
What about Safeboot? xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yELOiYgR2aI&feature=related
They have 300 viewers? Wow.
OHAI VIDEO DESCRIPTION!
everytime I heard fly me to the moon ( preferibly one of the female singers and not the original with Frank Sinatra(sp?) ) I want Luna to sing the song =x
Bass Rarity is win
I like the utada hikaru version
Indeed.
And what OS does LL use o.o
03I could have her try that
or the one from Bayonetta
03Windows 7 starter or one of those really cheap 7 crap
03:/
Safeboot + Netowrking
that's evill
aww :|
Does she have IE9 lol
she didn't wanted to be on the moon
or the version fro Evangallion. Not that I ever actually watched the anime
03probably not
03it doesn't matter though, the virus blocks IE
9so wait
safe mode
Yeah, fail viruses
9do they only air youtube videos or what?
But I have to say the Remix of Utad's is my fave next to bayonetta
it has a nice beat to it
inb4wasn'tshesealedINthemoon?
I liked Bayonetta
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObvBsS11AB8
03well
figured ud already be on here xiagu
That's Eva 2.0's fly me to the moon
lol it sounds like something I wrote a few years back
03it would have to be Safe Mode with Networking so I could use teamviewer LOL
03...
So how did she get it in the first place o.o
What does the "^" prefix indicate?
03you wrote a virus?
That's what I said :O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ2QgcRrWlc
once, but it was only a test
What did it do
9if that's the case....man, they really got to work on their variety
I gotta figure out how my PC disables all youtube adds but my laptop doesn't
INB4 Formatted C
ninjapwny, I pinged out or something
means its an RP name
fail
I have a concept.
edited registry stuff
Is it a signifier for--- yeah, okay
superfail
I thought so
Siax meats Luna
Fun :p
Meets
Holy crud, NGE looks... smooth.
denied any exes besides the core ones and itself
O:
so keeping it small is best IMO
replaced dlls in system32
and something else I forgot
I'm actually not a fan of two word names,but it comes with the terratory
03and HML she probably got it from unsafe Link porn
/me runs
She created the LL killer
lmfao
Ohnoes
Not the safer porn on your server :O
it wasn't self-spreading though and I only put it on school computers :p
9in any case, guys
?
04Horrible?
04Orly
/me is sad ):
03writing a virus
I mad a batch file that opened billions of sites that crashed IE and rebooted
:P
03kinda makes you a bad person
04k
04wait
You mean people
04NUU
04XD
=P
Who here would draw Siax and Luna together?
drf
04we still love you
/me hugs
9when The Brony Show is over, tell people in the chat to come over here. I'm gonna draw stuff and take requests...probably : 3
who's Siax?
I prolly would.
wtf is siax
I wrote the virus to challenge myself :p
?
Don't have a scanner though.
Also.
MOON! SHINE DOWN!
04to see how much you could hack
04wait it was windows?
It's not hard to write a virus anyway :p
Siax is one of the chracters from kingdom hearts
*spamhammerlol*
yes
His element was the moon
oh
windows viruses are easy crap
04I think the real challange was on the OS
spy sapping your moon shine?
/me runs
rofl
linux viruses are harder to make
>_>
moonshine?
Hivemind
.v.
no HML, a virus one
whar moonshine?
...
mac one
LOL
Yeah
Macs are too simple
There is nothing to kill :P
rofl
blah x-x
Moondancer is already the name of a character in the show, though you never actually see him lol
just get the virus to sudo rm -rf /
since macs are also based off unix
him/her
Silvermane shipping drawing!
*Vinyl
i mean, if you want.
sounds more like a colts name though
if that's alright
IMO >_>
Yet you pay for it :p
9when I actually start drawing, that is
but, whatever you want to do is alright, i guess
Silly apple
9just telling ya to invite people
who said no one could ever have the same name?
i just wanted to make fluttershy quotes
linux > macs
And is Unix supposed to be free?
:P
I'm not, I just wanted to be more original
less CRAP on it
yeah
Or is it both
Okay then
then I found out this name is semi popular lol
9>yfw I draw Scootaloo as Gundam
/me cries
I polled my two-word names queue and that's what I got :/
I think apple is using the GPL license
/me hugs LL :o
http://www.opensource.apple.com/
03that says UNIX
03on it
rofl drf
I just assumed that Moondancer was a filly for some reason
I'd draw, but my skethc book is with my cousin and I suck at digital.
/me huggles back :'(
03you heard about that?
9DEM TITS
03there's that one state thats slogan is Live Free or Die
it sounds like a girls name to me
03so someone got one that said UNIX
probably is, not many actual noticable colts in the series lol
Speaking of girl names
Did you hear about the Finnish guy who changed his name to Rainbow Dash?
So Xiagu what was your name before becoming a nobody?
I'll die, thank you very much :)
*Insert ballistics joke here*
hahaha
hahahahaha
Or just Pirate, which is worse
lawl, locke
His life.
yeah, I also heard he didn't actually go throw with it
/me rubs her ears.
freedom <3
Windows <3
BOOBS.
lindows
I did hear someone official changed their middle name to Fluttershy, but no one really cares about middle names
Locke, I am confused. Try again? (y/n)
No
Not that again
And what about a Open Source Windows :P
I made a nobody versionn of my name. It was Hexlarcs
Aka Unbootu
lindows is a horrible OS
9DAT GURREN-DAN FLAG
EW UBUNTU
Hello
Haha
oh. This name actually predates me knowing about Kingdom Hearts and possible predates KH as well, but I'm less sure of that
I refuse to use any major Linux distro :P
03LOL lindows
03have you heard of reactOS though?
That thing has the most hilarious running animation ever.
possibly, even.
OHAI BARRY!
03I used that at school to get access to drive C:
I need to beat Kingdom hearts too... probably won't
I don't play many games any more =/
So who wants to figure out what Hexlarcs is an anagram of?
/me does
looooool reactos
then try to work it out
/me ponders over it a moment, "Too complicated."
try BeOS or solaris
Ffff
Interface is broken, brb
03haha
03that explains why LL got a virus
sorry if we're bothering you there Octavia
03>Norton
03>PATHETIC USELESS PILE OF S***
Rachels
oh god norton
/me tilts her head, "Oh, no. Nopony is."
Rachels was close
/me gives up
you might as well use windows ME with no antivirus or firewall
Fail
Something happen?
that'd be more secure
grrr, put the Ch in the wrong place
Or Windows XP with no firewall and IE6? :P
actually no
Not sure
Norton has actually worked well for me
I knew that a girls name didn't make any sense...
caught a whole bunch of stuff thus far
Here he goes again
octavia is noctavia is not one of the sisters of pinkie pie ?
I just hate seeing senseless bashing
?
norton catches too much
Noctavia sounds like her vampire name.
As in
sorry :P
it gives a lot of false positives
great now I'm gonna need a vampire story!
octavia is not one of the sisters of pinkie pie ? *
/me will be noctavia tonight, has to work till 7am.
thanks alot
starnight fanon wise yes
canon it has never been confirmed
It's just a fun little bit of fannon.
I like it though.
Ouch, how much sleep do you get octivia?
I remember when I first got my laptop
cause pinkies sister is really close looking to octavia
/me wishes he was much better at drawing and animation, has an idea for a fan piece depicting Rarities fashion show that never happened at the gala
It had Mcafee on it, blocked everything IRC related
And slowed everything down too :p
lol mcafee
mcafee can gdiaf
Blinky Pie =/= Octavia
slinky pie
hahahahaha
03^
03so can Norton
(Hint: The Student Laptop manual said No Chatroom sites) So I loled and killed the services off :3
funnily enough there's a McAfee building a blocks away from my school
03both are pathetic piles of crap
/me thinks back and shrugs, "I slept some. Been to wrapped up in personal work to nap."
…Blinky Pie?
he's trying to make the shoe fit on his head
03bomb it
9trying to hook up tablet
indeed
Burn it down
Hah
lmao
there's also a Cisco building
ah
Cisco LOL
As well as Inky Pie, Sue Pie, and Clyde Pie
Inky, Blinky, Pinkie, and... sue
too*
I would rather have false positives than an infection
Never had a Cisco product before
think of putting the gurren lagann ost while drawing?
Well dont overwork yourself...
9gonna use the SRW OST
I'd rather have no anti-virus and no viruses at all
darnit
For some reason I'm really tempted to click that link to Equestriaafterdark... Is that bad?
And tbh AVG does a better job than norton
only 1 or 2 TTGL songs on it
And the price for norton just makes it even worse
AVG lol
DO IT
…what link?
GIVE INTO UR HATE
AVG isn't that bad
9so uh
??
AVG I tried
9guys, check if the Brony Show is over
9if it is, get some people here
best setup though, is having no antivirus
i am no stranger to deadlines, do what you have to and sleep when .. no pony is watching.
but did nto like it much
9there we go
get spybot
9tablet is live
*not
I can't
and a few other things
my bank account is frozen for now
Sue is their mother.
run a firewall and such
isn't spybot free?
Ahh
Clyde the father
Funny thing
I can't make withdrawls from it or deposits into it
Just rewatched episode 8 of TTGL
manly tears
not unless you want real time protection
9or not
which I demand
TTGL?
that part I never learned.
My XP partition had no firewall or active protected
Ah
is that the one when ***********?
what's the new site?
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
Who named them anyway?
Yet It hasn't had a virus in the year of constant use yet o.o
Manly, manly tears
ninjapwny, yep, it's the part where *************
ah
That part
;_;
9Just direct them to the dinkypage one
i remember that
/me sits and watches as the names go all around
lol at spybot's example image
WATCH THIS SHOW
http://www.safer-networking.org/images/live_protection_beta3.png
I have an older bro much like... well, the character in question
It's funny
I meant for me :P
PEOPLE WHO HAVENT SEEN TTGL
I liked Gurren Lagann
When I watched TTGL
It's the only anime I've ever watched
He disappeared from the Internet
germanpornhijack.exe
Niice, Germans
He almost died in a car wreck
I enjoyed it.
I want Cased Closed ponies.
one of the first series that had a big twist I couldn't see coming a mile away lol
Seems like Silvermane is gonna ship people in #silvershipper if you're in that sorta stuff
show is not over
http://codyrapol.com/~Dexter/Gengar.jpg
Case closed is liekt he ebst anime ever to me.
GO TO SLEEP

There's another shirt I got at Otakon
spybot is awesome though
What are we talking about??
"My Little Ponyta" lol
>mfw I had the exact same advert as DCD has
plus Norton is working fine for me
<Celestia> You rang, ^RainbowDash?
Gengar... *shudder*
o.o
mook go back to /a/
otakon is over?
okay.jpg
so I am not interested in something else right now
We're talking about anime apparently
so what we looking at?
So...
yup
(the military meet stuff)
I'm only stating mine
any specific anime?
lol ads
Has anyone read Time Lords and Terror?
Is Zecora a Zebstrika?
its caught a whole bunch of crap
top five anime
ttgl
Yes
not really
we be looking at a tablet drawer that ISN'T in the right shape
I've seen several Gurren Lagann references in FiM
so am I
exp the glasses
Well, norton does do that but I don't like its false positives
Still in tears
What?
I am stating my thoughts on the issue
I wonder how that crap got on there in the first place
I haven't seen any references
I know you are, I'm not forcing you to change your mind :p
When did I call for Celestia?
Yes, it's awesome, that and 12/Traveler got me into Doctor Who
It all starts from the browser, just sayin' :P
<Celestia> You said, "OH GOD".
lol HML
you are being kind of arrogant about it
me or HML?
you
03...
I like Case Closed, Cowboy Beebop, Digimon, Inyuyash, and Boondocks (which counts to me)
03I deleted the virus, right
03and now it says
lol at ad timing out
03Cannot find a program to open .exe files
03WTF do I do
O.o
lolwut
I am so confused o.0
What
REGISTRY TIME
Boondocks is western
xD
well the emoticons kind of give it away
yeah probably registry
joking aside, i like Ga-Rei Zero
/a/ ?
Did you ignore the "counts to me part"
without meaning
In an English context, anime refers to Japanese animation
don't take it personally :p
Of course not
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/bfb1c15e9a7ccdc468056f00244e6077/3522%20-%20crossover%20Gurren_Lagann.png
Apparently he did
yeah, there's no references
Doesn't change the fact that you're wrong :V
the :p one usually acompanies a sly remark
or an arrogant remark
I don't care
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505
Lol
I don't use it that way
I found like 15 references with a single search lol
I don't use random emoticons
I think we're talking about actual referencers
heck I don't use them period
top 4 for me
Not fanon nonsense
Well, everyone's different
You're just boring :P
I'm not saying you have to :p
lol HML
Plus if we say it just means japanese animation than a lot of other shows count to.
no need for that :p
avatar?
right?
its because people abuse them
Sorry :p
lot of my favorites are relatively old
and you HML
(little kids, not blue people)
A lot of shows are animated by japanese companies.
http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-exe-file-asso-windows-7-vista-incorrectly-associated/ < This too
Barry, yes i finished that on Friday
Slayers, Escaflowne, Nausica/PrincessMonoke/every other movie that guys made lol
it was better than the real Doctor Who
Slayers is great
Lina is love
never seen it
03ah
03I found it
Then you must bleed.
but i see it on netflix aLL THE TIME
I rather enjoyed Rune Soldier
I like Summar Wars
Or if you don't do that, then at least ooze fatally.
summer wars was great
well its a habit worth breaking
gunxsword was good too
It's similar in some respects to Slayers
>yfw I didn't read ANY Doctor Whooves fic
It's a habit that I don't mind :p
I don't think it's such a horrible habit
Back to 2ch with me
Is Slayers Gorgeous the one with the Amazing Lina-Doll?
Did I help DRF? :o
Especially where text can be taken the wrong way
I cry though, I've never seen NEXT... and I cannot find it without having to buy the entire first 3 series included >_>
YES
Timelords and Terror was amazing, it had such diction, description, characterization, and personification that I could only dream of being skilled enough to use
Heh, it's all a matter of perspective
HAHAHA I loved that one
I laughed so hard to that movie
and naga's golem... >_>
Hurr yeah
I find emoticon abuse a bit annoying
Colossal bouncing boobs
and at times its misleading
That was hilariou
To me, :P would mean not to take what someone said to heart
**hilarious
even the simple ideas of what the ponies were doing off screen was stuff I am not able to think up
Now im interested.
Agreed*
I haven't read any Doctor Whooves fics yet. Just ones where he's a background Time Pony
lmao
that there's some sort of sarcasm or playful gesture to what they said
Hey when is that new avatar mini series supposed to come out?
do I need to find an emoticon dictionary and show you what that really means?
(Like Romancing Quest. Doctor and Twilight's date was hilarious)
imo you're taking this all too seriously, no offence
Legend of korra?
all this non pony talk is disturbing the force lol
I think we're alienating people here lol
ah, i've seen a few where he is just a character
Yeah that Mr Moo moo
Doesn't Legend of Korra come out in 2012
/me eheh, tends to get a little carried away when he starts talking about stuff he likes
aww
9good gosh
if it was we'd run out of things to talk about eventually.
9this tablet is a pain in the hindquarters
During a movie night we should ask all the viewers what we can do to improve.
What they want.
Hai Everypony!
^
Fact: most bronies like other cartoons too.
... I can't wait till I get to my trixie picture I want to draw...
More insufferably bad movies!
ooooohohohohohohhoho >_>
Erm.. *@Locke
.me shrugs
Be back in a little while, guys. Gonna switch machines.
aww I messed up
well I just find it a bit annoying
friggin nucular
I mean abuse
good of u to show up
I want some more Wild Berry Pepsi this stuff is awesome.
If this chat was exclusively pony related I would have left already
nucular?
who says that?!
yea
03LOL
03I found it on my own
'MURICANS
S'all good. Letting something like that bother you is silly
My dad abuses elipses
03scanning it now
I hate it when topic-themed chatrooms or forums ONLY talk about the topic.
Wild berry Pepsi?
As in EXCLUSIVELY
Makes me think I'm in trouble all the time, but nothing to complain about
Baww ;.;
Wild Berry Pepsi dood!
But hah
/me temporarily ker-plodes
wooot
OMG Prinnies and ponies!
Nucular huh?
I LOVE PEPSI
yup
Thats how you pronounce it in KFC
I love it ninjapwny!
I'm gonna talk like a prinny now dood.
hey NewDCD: do you think Airplanes! is a B-Movie?
No thanks
...yes
lawl
then u are
NUCULAR
Muhahahahhaah
Yes It is.....
Why is there no Disgea Pony crossover
/me knights him with a mighty sword
Nucular.....
we should watch spiders web
MLP is dieing to have prinnies.
^NO
WTF IS A PRINNY?
/me takes the sword with gratitude!
The most awesomest doods ever
how about we watch the worlds longest porno intro ever again then
MLP moogles!
/me stares for a moment
let me get ya a picture dood!
I tried to tolerate
Is there a Transformers/MLP crossover?
it
prinny, from disdia? or however that animes called
Yes I shall assasinate the dragons with this!
/me slaps HML
but its misleading
They're both Hasbro...
you perv
Reading Simply Rarity.
Did not bring tissues down with me.
.v.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Prinnyart.png
What
There is
We need to watch The Room?
I keep thinking people are making sly and arrogant remarks
Please explain the name o.o
Is likely to soak his pillow in tears.
FreezeFrame, omfg epic fanfic is epic
Theres been thousands of Transformer,/pony fics.
manly tears were shed
Eeyup
Like sense always
/me goes into the shower and locks the door
Well, sorry for misleading you then
I figured.
which is normally what sticking your tongue out means
I must acquire them.
So you could probably find about 30 or so based on FIM
hm
and another 300 of pre FIM
i have seen prinnies before
9guys my tablet is being a bitch
9I think I'll have to take this tomorrow to get soldered. Again.
/me tries to remember WHAR PRINNIES
Prinnies are the souls of bad people in the underworld. They are halarios and say dood alot. They also explode when you through them
No, PizzaPony, not manly tears
?!?
when you WHAT through them?
The tears from Simply Rarity need no such feeble excuse.
I mean it in the way to not take it seriously
Oh through
true, they are tears of pain and joy and sorrow
he accidentally the prinnies
tears of the soul
why do I keep typing that?
…lolwut?
/me gives ninjapwny a big ass gold bullion.....
When you THROW a prinny they explode.
But honestly, don't take me seriously or most of the things I say will turn out offensive
wait, is that the one that ships Twilight and Trixie?
…lolwut?
Twixie is best ship.
eeeyup
FTW!
Though I'm a diehard Twiluna fan
eh
Ballad of TwilightSparkle is supposed to be better.
9yeah
what does it mean then
9I don't think we can do this today
NO SHIPPING
Blood, Sweat, and Tears was amazing too
I can't find it in any dictionary
9tablet's soldered cable is fucked up
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505
I just wanted to read a 6 star story that was actually -complete- and settled for a 5 star
oops wrong thing
aww, but NewDCD, i need Pizza Cake drawings
Even when it last updated a month ago
I mean it in the way to not take it seriously
But we need boats to get to the next contenents
9 will take it tomorrow to get soldered and will draw tomorrow insteam
9*instead
/me kills CGI:IRC
with all the girl x girl ships equestria's ponies die out because no mares bare children lol
yeah
have a chapter where nyx doen't cry ?
9this is very frustrating
lol
9but oh well
doh'k
well
if there is no shipping how will we float on the water.
Aww
WEll we don't really have a lot of guy ponies to ship in the first place :/
Mibbit > CGI
what does an actual dictionary say about its meaning?
Step 1
I know, I'm being sarcastic
lol
Ascend from Darkness
12It also can mean frustration to me as well
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emoticon
BlackClops
Except Machintosh O_O
13Well, goodnight all :3
and the fics with guys ship them too!
step 2 spear the winged beast?
Byeeee
there is no heterosexuality in equestria, lol
9yeah guys
:P or :Þ tongue sticking out: joke, sarcasm or disgusting
idk
Aw yes the geneder inequality issue is a major problem with shipping.
Hell yeaaaah
9that made me pretty buttfrustrated
9I'm going off
that is what it means
and we can't just make up a story that they have special ways to bare kids either cause faust even said they have kids like normal horses lol
actually i dunno
alright, cya soon NewDCD
12EW :Þ
Okay, Later DCD.
Bye DCd
9gonna look for a thread in Ponychan or something
Well, we're a different community, I guess :p
search the Black Ops level Vorkuta and look on the objectives
depends on the situation, I think some colts will find it favorable
kind of makes it look like the Mr. Yuck stickers
9and sketch shit there in pencil and paper
lolwut?
!link magical_lesbian_spawn
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
i think Step 2 is Ascend from darkness
>:|
bye bye
9not as fun as live but oh well
Xiagu WTH
the second one
the gender inequality wouldn't be as much of a problem if people would get creative.
wut
creative?
Sometimes I forget that DerpyBot doesn't actually search Ponibooru with the tags after link
Yeah but no one lets you use OCs not even for random drawings.
meh, I'm happy being a single pony lol
we love you NewDCD! Come back soon! with pizzacake
well there aren't enough colts, i agree.
in which case
Do it like they do it on the discovery channel.
i would... and i am going to regret saying this:
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36653?search=magical_lesbian_spawn
Dermathil, we need ya boy!
i would.. tolerate OC
I actually am theorizing that is one of the mane ways they are going to reach out to bronies
http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Vorkuta_(level)
Twilight told me this picture is about magical_lesbian_spawn luna ask_princess_luna twilight_sparkle artist:lulubell
more male characters
the steps
call me silly, but that is my theory
…
WHOEVER'S RUNNING CELESTIA RADIO
YOU'RE PLAYING THAT AD TOO MUCH
I find it very akward that the MLP comunity seems to have so much against OC.
[/caps]
Anyway I definitely support magical_lesbian_spawn as the answer to f/f shipping
I mean when I think MLP I think of it being all about making your own characters and stories.
O_O
meh @ that stupid drawing
really? i think of it as a show.
but i never played with the toys so
maybe that's why.
ok
Oh.
Thats why they are so customizable and thats why they are all made on a template.
12The tongue sticking out can also mean you’re concentrating on something or that you’re frustrated
/me gets up and waves goodbye for now, "Have a good evening, everypony."
So that's why they got 300 viewers.
Prison, lawl.
night Octavia
as I said
sleep well ^^
OH
lol
Noctavia the Noctowl
Seeya Tavy
How you or someone else interprets something is truly a matter of perspective :p
Good night. Hopefully inventory doesnt keep you up too late
sleep? oh no, work.
Sleep Octavia...
none of us see the world in the same way
oh
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
Work....
I interpreted that as sarcasm
wait, don't work,
what's about crazy-nutjob Prison?
oh lol, then have a good day/night at work then
Work is bad.
12What if we don't care?
another gig for you and you crew?
I need Ponies to name Cruisers after in Victoria 2. Anyone want to help me out? OCs welcome
I am sure i will be back when time allows.
Heya Aurora
You... Are going to LOVE ME!

12Because that’s not what it means to most of us
You should have seen the names for some of the characters in my book
I dunno tha either of my OCs would make good cruiser names
luna will get angry if she see thst we are sleeping
oh dear what have I walked into >.>
